<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following is an attempt, to &s;eparate what is &s;ub&s;tantial and material, from what is circum|&s;tantial and u&s;ele&s;s, in hi&s;tory. That of the late war forms the brighte&s;t period of any in the Briti&s;h annals; and the author has endeavoured to do it ju&s;|tice, by the manner in which he has recorded the &s;everal tran&s;actions, and the impartiality he has ob&s;erved. As to the fir&s;t, it is matter of opinion, and he mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by the judgment of his readers. His own inten|tion acquits him of every charge with re|gard to the latter. He is &s;en&s;ible, that in many pa&s;&s;ages, he has the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of party to encounter, and the &s;ame mu&s;t have been his fate, had he adopted different opi|nions. He di&s;claims all &s;y&s;tems in politics, and has been guided in his narrative by matters of fact only. In his reflections and conjectures, where his own lights failed
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
him, he had recour&s;e to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t capable of giving him proper infor|mation; and he has the &s;atisfaction to be|lieve, that when the prejudices of party are buried with their authors, the following pages, whatever defects they may have in point of compo&s;ition, will be acquitted of every imputation of partiality; as rational entertainment, and undeviating candour, have been his only objects.</P>
<P>This Review was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the <HI>Reading Mercury,</HI> and parcelled out every week in that paper, till compleated, when the Gentlemen, who had thus read it, thought &s;o well of the work, that they de&s;ired to have it reprinted, in this manner, that they might again purcha&s;e it, in a more conveni|ent form. The Author thinks him&s;elf ob|liged to tho&s;e Gentlemen, for the good opi|nion they entertain of his abilities and im|partiality, and hopes their te&s;timony will in &s;ome mea&s;ure recommend his labours to the notice of the public.</P>

<HEAD>THE MARTIAL REVIEW: OR, A GENERAL Hi&s;tory of the LATE WARS.</HEAD>
<P>_THE French, while they pretend to in&s;truct the re&s;t of mankind in the arts, have learnt the noble&s;t of them all from Great Britain, I mean that of civil polity, or the art of encrea&s;|ing national riches, power, and in|fluence at home and abroad. She &s;aw all her attempts for univer&s;al monarchy de&s;eated by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection given by England, a commercial nation, to the other &s;tates of Europe; and therefore judging that commerce was the &s;ource of real power, &s;he applied her&s;elf to its cultivation. During the long admini&s;tration of Cardinal Fleury, the French commerce was in|credibly extended; but the pride and ambition of the Princes of the Blood, and their great nobi|lity, (the late Mar&s;hal de Bellei&s;le in particular)
<PB N="2" REF="5">
drove that mini&s;ter from his pacific plans, and France renewed her expen&s;ive operations in a land war on the continent.</P>
<P>It appeared, during the cour&s;e of that war, that Fleury had not taken mea&s;ures for protecting the commerce which he had &s;o greatly extended, nor could we have been &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t trade which France then carried on, but from the prodigious lo&s;&s;es it &s;u&s;tained by our marine. This counter|balanced all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their arms on the continent of Europe; and, at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the whole &s;y&s;tem of continental power was altered. France gave up, or demo|li&s;hed, that barrier, which for &s;o many years might have been termed the cock-pit of Europe, from the many millions of lives &s;acrificed to acquire or d fend it, and &s;he agreed to the conferences of Aix-la-Chapelle, merely with the in&s;idious view of gaining lei&s;ure for pur&s;uing her com|mercial &s;chemes, and retrieving that error, which had proved &s;o fatal to her during the war, I mean her inability to defend her trade.</P>
<P>With tho&s;e two views that treaty was begun and conducted on the part of France. Her great &s;cheme was, that nothing definitive &s;hould be concluded. She was aware, that our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nova Scotia had been too loo&s;ely &s;tipulated by the treaty of Utrecht, and that it was liable, at lea&s;t, to &s;ome cavils, though nothing can be more certain from the &s;pirit, and even from the words of that treaty, than that it comprehended all the lands claimed by the Engli&s;h, and that when the treaty of Utrecht was executed, the Engli&s;h, in con&s;equence of that claim, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Nova Scotia, or Acadia, in pre&s;ence of the French commi&s;&s;aries, as appears by the report on 30th of Augu&s;t, 1714.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
It is not our intention to enter here into a mi+nute di&s;qui&s;ition of the particulars of that con|te&s;t, which we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> afterwards fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the &s;tate papers. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h, by the confe&s;&s;ion of the French them|&s;elves, had an infinite &s;uperiority in point of ar|gument, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t di&s;advantages they were under from their ignorance of the places in que&s;tion, and the arbitrary maps and charts (without the lea&s;t foundation of truth to &s;upport them) fabricated and produced by their adver&s;aries. The Briti&s;h plenipotentiaries at Aix-la-Chapelle, little dreaming, perhaps, of the con|&s;equences, or the importance of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, referred the limits of Acadia, or Nova Scotia, to be &s;ettled in conferences between the commi&s;&s;a|ries of the two nations at Paris. Our propo&s;ed brevity will not admit of particularizing the va|rious &s;hifts and &s;hufflings of the French com|mi&s;&s;aries, who proceeded on the &s;ame indeci&s;ive plan with that of their plenipotentiaries at Aix-la-Chapelle, that they might amu&s;e Great Britain, while France was encroaching upon her property in North America, and fortifying her encroach|ments in &s;uch a manner, as to bid defiance to all that the negociation could effect. It &s;oon appeared&punc; that they pretended to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the va&s;t country between Canada and Loui&s;iana, and were building a chain of forts, to maintain that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to exclude the Briti&s;h traders from all communication with their back &s;ettlements. In &s;hort, under pretence of having di&s;covered the mouths of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, they claimed all the country towards New Mexico on the ea&s;t, ex|tending to the Apalachian or Aligany mountains on the we&s;t. Tho&s;e claims were in direct vio|lation of the rights of the crown of Great Bri|tain, who&s;e &s;ubjects had been the fir&s;t di&s;coverers
<PB N="4" REF="7">
of tho&s;e countries, and accordingly his Maje&s;ty King George the Second had ordered a patent to be made out for a company of merchants and planters, granting them a con&s;iderable tract of land near the river Ohio, (by which the com|pany was denominated) but within what had been always con&s;idered to be the limits of the Briti&s;h province of Virginia. The intere&s;t of this company was incompatible with that of the French government; and it was very plain, that both could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Either the Engli&s;h mu&s;t be excluded from all trade with the Indians, and expo&s;ed to continual incur&s;ions both in war and peace, or the communication between the French Canadians, and the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi mu&s;t be cut off. Such an interruption would render the maintenance of the two provinces, which if joined mu&s;t be of infinite value, of little or no &s;ervice to France.</P>
<P>The French, &s;en&s;ible of this, not only drove the &s;ubjects of Great Britain from their new &s;et|tlements, but &s;ecured the command of the en|trance into the countries on the Ohio and Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi, by means of a fort built on the Forks of the river Monongahela, called Fort du Que&s;ne. The Briti&s;h government at this time were by no means di&s;po&s;ed for entering into a fre&s;h war; but the perpetual alarms it received from Virginia, and all their northern colonies, who con&s;idered them&s;elves as being on the brink of perdition, at la&s;t rou&s;ed the mini&s;try. Mr. Pelham was now dead, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the government ad|vi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to vigorous mea&s;ures. There was &s;till, however, in the cabinet a pacific party &s;trong enough to prevent any precipitate &s;teps being taken. It was therefore re&s;olved that no ho&s;tilities &s;hould be committed again&s;t France, but &s;uch as were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a&s;&s;erting
<PB N="5" REF="8">
the undoubted rights of the Briti&s;h crown, and for repelling the inva&s;ions upon our own colonies. This plan was the more plau&s;ible, as it could be carried to what extent we plea&s;ed. The French had violently di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Major Wa&s;hington from a fort, or rather entrenchment, rai&s;ed on Briti&s;h ground; many Briti&s;h &s;ubjects had been killed; many were carried into captivity; and the French had declared they were re&s;olved to maintain their u&s;urpations by the &s;word. What added to the deplorable condition of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts, was the collu&s;ion between the French and their barbarous Indians. For the former no &s;ooner granted a capitulation, which they never did but for their own conveniency, than it was broken by the latter, whom the French pretended they could not controul.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try's having received undoubted intelligence that the French had &s;ent &s;everal &s;hips of war with land forces, arms, and ammunition of all kinds, to &s;upport their u&s;urpations in America, orders were &s;ent to all the Briti&s;h colonies there to arm, and make &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as might effectually oppo&s;e the enemy, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them from their encroach|ments. They were given to under&s;tand, at the &s;ame time, that they were to be &s;upported by a body of regular troops from England, under Ma|jor General Braddock, who was to command in chief in America; and that &s;everal expeditions were intended. The fir&s;t and chief, headed by Braddock, again&s;t fort du Que&s;ne; one again&s;t the French forts in Nova Scotia, and another again&s;t Crown-Point, on the frontiers of New-York; be&s;ides another under General Shirley, to the lakes Eric and Ontario. It appears, that the conduct of the Briti&s;h colonies on this occa&s;ion was neither &s;uitable to their danger, nor the in|tere&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="9">
of their mother country. Many of them, from the character they had acquired in the pre|ceding war, took it ami&s;s that they were to be commanded by a General from England; each province had a &s;eparate intere&s;t to pur&s;ue; and, in &s;hort, the di&s;po&s;itions they made for receiving and &s;upporting Braddock, upon &s;o long a march, and &s;o dangerous an expedition, were weak and di&s;&s;ipated; though it was plain, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole depended upon their unanimity and hearty concurrence.</P>
<P>As to Braddock, he was unexceptionable in point of courage and regular education as a &s;ol|dier, but a very unfit man to command irregular and provincial troops; and indeed, from the time of his arrival in America to the day of his death, he &s;eems to have re&s;olved to do his duty, but to have de&s;paired of doing it with &s;ucce&s;s; and the event but too fatally verified his forebodings. He complained that nothing was in readine&s;s for his reception or march; he conceived an aver&s;ion and contempt for the provincials, and he was upon no very good terms with his own officers; but, what was wor&s;t of all, he abandoned the excellent &s;et of in&s;tructions which had been given him by his R. H. the D. of C. for his conduct during the expedition. The con&s;equence was, that for want of employing irregulars on the flanks of his ar|my, and to &s;cour the country through which he was to march, he fell into an ambu&s;cade of French and Indians on the 9th of July, 1755, and was totally defeated. The enemy had en|trenched them&s;elves &s;o artfully, that his troops had not an opportunity of exerting their valour, and &s;tunned with the frightful yells of the barbarians, they &s;eemed to forget the u&s;e of their arms, and &s;tood the unactive marks of their enemies fury;
<PB N="7" REF="10">
&s;o that all who remained in the field, among&s;t whom were the General and almo&s;t all the offi|cers, were killed, and &s;carce half the army e&s;|caped.</P>
<P>The expedition again&s;t Crown-Point was com|manded by General John&s;on, who, having ad|vanced as far as lake George, was attacked in his entrenchments by Die&s;kau, the French Ge|neral, who being likewi&s;e a regular bred officer, had &s;o great a contempt for the provincials un|der John&s;on, that he attacked them without can|non; but was defeated, and him&s;elf taken pri|&s;oner. This &s;ucce&s;s happening &s;o late as the 7th of September, the victory was attended with no great advantages to Great Britain.</P>
<P>As to General Shirley's expedition, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe it, his proceedings were &s;o unintelligible to all but him&s;elf. What we know of them is, that having marched over prodigious tracts of land, he came very late in the year to fort O&s;wego, and left 700 men there to be &s;acrificed, as they afterwards were, by the enemy, and then returned without doing any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The expedition again&s;t the French forts in Nova Scotia, under Colonel Monckton, was &s;ucce&s;sful, and of infinite &s;ervice to the mother country.&mdash;But we are now to attend the opera|tions of another element.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June 1755, two French men of war were taken by the Admirals Bo&s;cawen and Mo&s;tyn, who had been &s;ent to America to intercept the French &s;upplies. But notwith|&s;tanding all the Briti&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the public of England were far from being &s;atisfied with the &s;tate of the war, which they were taught to be|lieve would have been much more &s;plendid in their favour. A re&s;olution was therefore taken
<PB N="8" REF="11">
by our government to con&s;ider the war as being actually proclaimed by the ho&s;tilities that had been committed by the French in America, and orders were given for the Briti&s;h &s;hips to take all the French ve&s;&s;els and their cargoes, wherever they could be met with by &s;ea; &s;o that before the end of the year, above 300 French ve&s;&s;els, many of them very richly laden, and above 8000 of their mo&s;t &s;erviceable &s;eamen, were carried into the ports of Great Britain.</P>
<P>This proceeding amazed all Europe, and the tamene&s;s of France was not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing. The Duke de Mirepoix, the French Amba&s;&s;ador, had declared to his Maje&s;ty and his mini&s;try, that the fir&s;t gun, fired by Briti&s;h again&s;t French &s;hips, would be con&s;idered by his ma&s;ter as a declaration of war, and &s;et all Europe in a flame, and upon ho&s;tilities being begun in America, he was re|called. No repri&s;als, however, were made by the French, all they did was to &s;end a letter to Mr. Fox, the Brit&s;h &s;ecretary of &s;tate, accu&s;ing our Admirals and &s;ea Captains of piracy and rob|bery; and to fill the courts of Europe with com|plaints of our conduct. In acting, they affected &s;o much moderation, that after taking the Bland|ford &s;hip of war, they relea&s;ed her upon that prin|ciple. The motives of this pa&s;&s;ive conduct were &s;oon explained.</P>
<P>Since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle to the year 1756, the French had been ince&s;&s;antly labouring to repair their marine; but though they &s;pent im|men&s;e &s;ums, and made a va&s;t progre&s;s in that de|&s;ign, yet it was &s;till unequal to that of Great Britain. They therefore formed two &s;chemes, the fir&s;t was the conque&s;t of Minorca, and the latter an attempt upon Hanover. To render both &s;ucce&s;sful, in the &s;pring of 1756, they brought down troops to Picardy, and &s;uch of the
<PB N="9" REF="12">
French coa&s;ts as lie neare&s;t to England, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> a &s;hew of invading Great Britain; and, in the mean time, a &s;quadron of twelve men of war of the line, commanded by the Admiral Gali&s;&s;oniere, with 11 or 12,000 troops on board, commanded by the the Duke de Richelieu, &s;ailed from Toulon, and landed in Minorca, where, on the 25th of April, they opened trenches before fort St. Philip.</P>
<P>His Britannic Maje&s;ty was, all this while, con|certing mea&s;ures for keeping the flames of war from breaking out in Germany, and for the pre|&s;ervation of his Hanoverian dominions. No Prince or private man in Europe under&s;tood, &s;o well as he did, the views and intere&s;ts of the Northern Powers. He was &s;en&s;ible that the Em|pre&s;s Queen would take the fir&s;t opportunity of revoking the ce&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia, which &s;he had made to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by the treaties of Dre&s;den and Bre&s;lau; and the court of Vienna had already been tampering with him on that ac|count, but perceived him inflexible in his gua|ranty&s;hip of that country to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. Her Imperial Maje&s;ty refu&s;ed him the troops &s;ti|pulated by treaty for the defence of Hanover, which the French made now no &s;ecret they intended to invade. The Dutch were required in like terms to furni&s;h the 6000 troops &s;tipulated for the de|fence of Great Britain, in ca&s;e of a war with France, but refu&s;ed for the &s;ame rea&s;on, viz. becau&s;e the war between Great Britain and France in Germany, not affecting Europe, was not a ca&s;e of the treaty. His Britannic Ma|je&s;ty had the magnanimity to overlook this in|gratitude of the Dutch, by ordering his mini&s;ter Colonel York to de&s;i&s;t from the demand.</P>
<P>By this time the French armies had a&s;&s;embled on the Upper Rhine, and the Mo&s;elle; and the court of Ver&s;ailles found means to bring the E|lector
<PB N="10" REF="13">
of Cologne over, to &s;uffer magazines to be erected in We&s;tphalia, which could only be with a view of attacking Hanover. But though the dread of &s;uch an attack did not in the lea&s;t &s;hake his Maje&s;ty in the &s;y&s;tem he had adopted, viz. that of hazarding all events rather than Great Britain &s;hould &s;uffer; yet he took early and wi&s;e precautions for the defence of his Hanoverian dominions; and at the very time when, unknown to him, the courts of Vienna and Peter&s;burgh were forming &s;chemes for dividing the &s;poils of Pru&s;&s;ia, he entered into a &s;ub&s;idiary treaty for taking 55,000 Ru&s;&s;ians, and 40 or 50 Ru&s;&s;ian galleys into pay for pre&s;erving the quiet of Ger|many, if invaded by foreign troops. He like|wi&s;e entered into another &s;ub&s;idiary treaty with the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, for 12,000 of his troops, who were to be employed, if either England or Hanover &s;hould be attacked. The&s;e treaties, though &s;trongly oppo&s;ed in the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment, were at la&s;t approved of there, and, in fact, brought on a new treaty between Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had for &s;ome time been &s;e|cretly di&s;contented with the mini&s;ters of Ver&s;ailles; but they continued to all appearance to be &s;o in|timately connected, that his Britannic Maje&s;ty was not a little apprehen&s;ive that France had brought him into her views; to obviate which had been the great end of the two &s;ub&s;idiary trea|ties we have mentioned. But no &s;ooner was that with Ru&s;&s;ia made public, than his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty declared in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, that he would oppo&s;e to the utmo&s;t, the introduction of all foreign troops what&s;oever into the empire. Thus the views of their Britannic and Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ties came to be preci&s;ely the &s;ame, though ari&s;ing from different objects. The former was
<PB N="11" REF="14">
apprehen&s;ive of the French, the latter of the Ru&s;|&s;ians; and this coincidence of &s;entiments, with &s;ome eclairci&s;ements, as to the views of the court of Vienna, brought on the famous treaty of London with Pru&s;&s;ia, which was &s;igned January the 16th, 1756; by which he obtained a &s;ub&s;idy from Great Britain of 750,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, for &s;er|vices that were extremely obvious, and the two Potentates agreed not to make a peace without the con&s;ent of each other. The publication of this treaty produced that of Vienna, between the Em|pre&s;s Queen and his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty; to which the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia acceded, and laid the foundation of the pre&s;ent bloody war. The Briti&s;h court was not in&s;en&s;ible that the French intended to attack Minorca, and had appointed Admiral Byng to &s;ail to the Mediterranean with a &s;quadron equal to that under Gali&s;&s;oniere. The public is well apprized of Byng's mi&s;con|duct, mi&s;carriage, and fate. He had, at be&s;t, a doubtful engagement with Gali&s;&s;oniere, and un|der pretext of providing for the &s;afety of Gi|braltar, he abandoned that of fort St. Philip, which was taken by the French, and Minorca reduced to their obedience.</P>
<P>This advantage gained by the French, with the account of the lo&s;s of O&s;wego, and of the pre|valence of the French power in America, rai&s;ed &s;uch a clamour again&s;t the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, that the chief of them re&s;igned their places, but their characters were fully vindicated by a parliamen|tary enquiry &s;et on foot, and carried on by their enemies; the report of which entirely acquitted them of being in the lea&s;t acce&s;&s;ary to any of the late military misfortunes; but as this is a martial and not a cabinet review, we are to con|fine it to military matters.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
The danger of an inva&s;ion from France &s;till continuing, a motion was made, and carried through the Hou&s;e of Commons, to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty to call over a body of Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, for the defence of his regal dominions. This addre&s;s was complied with, and the fo|reigners accordingly arrived, to the number of 12 or 13,000, and to the great di&s;gu&s;t of the public, who thought Great-Britain was in a con|dition to defend her&s;elf.</P>
<P>His Britannic Maje&s;ty was this year offered a neutrality by the courts of Vienna and Ver&s;ailles, but he magnanimou&s;ly rejected it, becau&s;e the conditions annexed to it were di&s;honourable in them&s;elves, and would have been detrimental to the common cau&s;e. This firmne&s;s endeared him &s;till more to his Parliament, who being fired with indignation at the menaces of the French, now in full march again&s;t Hanover, agreed on the 21&s;t of February, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty in forming, what was called, an army of ob&s;ervation in Germany, to be commanded by the Duke of Cumberland, who accordingly put him&s;elf at the head of it on the 16th of April, 1757.</P>
<P>The French on this occa&s;ion had formed two armies, the one commanded by Mon&s;. d'Etrees, one of the be&s;t general officers in France, con&s;i&s;t|ing of above 86,000 men, de&s;tined to act again&s;t Hanover, but under the pretext of &s;erving as allies to the Empre&s;s-Queen, and guarantees of the treaty of We&s;tphalia. The other, con&s;i&s;ting of 25,000 men, was commanded by the Prince de Soubi&s;e, and was to join the Army of the Empire, which was to put in execution the Im|perial Ban again&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. Before the latter army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, it &s;eized the Pru&s;&s;ian territories of Cleves, Meurs, and Guel|dres, while a detachment of the army under

d'Etrees made it&s;elf ma&s;ter of Embden, and of every thing belonging to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty in Ea&s;t Frie&s;land. But we are now, in as &s;ummary a manner as po&s;&s;ible, to attend the important operations of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's arms.</P>
<P>We have already taken notice of the dange|rous tendency of the treaty of Peter&s;burgh again&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, and having full proofs of its &s;ecret articles, he re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time. He had ordered his mini&s;ter at the court of Vi|enna to demand clear and categorical an&s;wers as to the de&s;tination of the va&s;t armaments making in Moravia and Bohemia, but he received no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. At the &s;ame time the King of Poland had a&s;&s;embled an army of 16,000 men, with which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important and impregnable pa&s;s of Pirna. On the 29th of Augu&s;t, 1756, he demanded from the King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, free pa&s;&s;age for his troops, and that his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty, as a proof of his neutrality, &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s his army. This not being complied with, the pa&s;s of Pirna was blockaded, there being no way to reduce it but by famine. The blockade was &s;carce formed, when Brown, the Au&s;trian General, marched to the relief of the Saxons; upon which his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty put him&s;elf at the head of his army under Field-Mar&s;hal Keith, and fought the bat|tle of Lowo&s;itz, in which Brown was defeated, and the Saxons at Pirna forced to &s;urrender upon capitulation; &s;o that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's army wintered in Saxony, and he him&s;elf, by forcing his way into the archives of Dre&s;den, notwith|&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition made by the Queen of Poland, who&s;e hu&s;band had retired to his regal dominions, obtained the original proofs of the confederacy that had been formed again&s;t him.</P>

At the opening of the campaign next year, every thing appeared very unfavourable for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. His victory at Lowo&s;itz had been attended with no other con&s;equence than the &s;urrender of the pa&s;s of Pirna! the Au&s;trian army in Bohemia, commanded by Prince Charles of Lorrain and General Brown, amounted to 80,000 men; the Czarina &s;ent 60,000 men un|der the command of Mar&s;hal Apraxin, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;trong fleet, to invade the Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia; and the Swedes, in hopes of recovering what they had lo&s;t in Pomerania, joined the &s;ame con|federacy, being aided by 6000 troops of Meck|lenburgh. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, however, with a cool rapidity peculiar to him&s;elf, divided his army into three bodies, which at the &s;ame time penetrated into Bohemia. The fir&s;t was under Mar&s;hal Schwerin, and entered that country from Sile&s;ia. The &s;econd was under the Prince of Bevern, who marched from Lu&s;atia, and bravely defeated a body of 28,000 Au&s;trians on the 21&s;t of April. The la&s;t body was commanded by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf, who, after a train of operations, the mo&s;t judicious, perhaps, that can be met with in hi&s;tory, joined his two Generals in Bohemia, and proceeded again&s;t the great body of Au&s;trians, who thought them&s;elves impregna|bly encamped near Prague; but nothing could with&s;tand the ardour of the Pru&s;&s;ians; for under all di&s;advantages they gained a complete victory over an hundred thou&s;and of their enemies, about forty thou&s;and of whom e&s;caped to Prague, which was now inve&s;ted on all &s;ides by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. He had lo&s;t in the late battle his brave General Schwerin, as the Au&s;trians had done General Brown, and he tru&s;ted chiefly to Field-Mar&s;hal Keith for the conduct of the &s;iege.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
It was in this &s;ituation of affairs, which threa|tened the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria with ruin, that Count Daun, who 'till then had made no di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in military hi&s;tory, was appointed to the command of the Au&s;trian troops. This General collected the di&s;per&s;ed parties of the Au&s;trians, and while the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was endeavouring to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Prague by a tremen|dous bombardment, he took a &s;trong po&s;t near that city, and the Pru&s;&s;ian army not being nu|merous enough entirely to inve&s;t it, he encou|raged the garri&s;on to make a vigorous defence, in hopes of being relieved. By this time his army was 60,000 &s;trong, and the Empre&s;s-Queen looking upon Prague as the Bulwark of Vienna, was continually reinforcing it. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty knew the value of time, and too much de&s;pi&s;ing the enemies he had lately conquered, came to a re&s;olution of forcing Daun in his in|trenchments at Colin, though they were by all but him&s;elf deemed impregnable. If he was guilty of any mi&s;take that day, it was his under|taking that mighty attempt with no more than 23,000 men. This temerity can only be excu&s;ed by the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of continuing the blockade of Prague; but, on the other hand, we are to con&s;ider what prodigious con&s;equences would have attended his attempt, had it been &s;ucce&s;sful, and likewi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of checking Daun's growing power, by which in time he him&s;elf might have been be&s;ieged by two ar|mies, one without and the other within the city. His conduct and courage on this occa&s;ion exceeded all expectation. He carried his two brothers with him to the action, and never was valour more &s;ignally, and more un&s;ucce&s;sfully employed. The battle la&s;ted from three in the afternoon till it was dark. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty
<PB N="16" REF="19">
charged at the head of his own cavalry, but had neglected to bring along with him a &s;ufficient number of infantry, or a train of artillery equal to his mighty enterprize. In &s;hort, he performed every thing but impo&s;&s;ibilities. He could not di&s;lodge the Au&s;trians from their triply fortified camp, each entrenchment ri&s;ing above the other, and defended by an immen&s;e artillery, in a ground where cavalry, in which the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;trength chiefly con&s;i&s;ted, could &s;carcely act. After &s;ix attacks, the King, collecting all his force, made the concluding charge, which, though more fu|rious, was as unavailing as the preceding; and perceiving that he could not gain his point, he ordered the Prince of Bevern to give the &s;ignal for a retreat, &s;aying, very cooly, <HI>We &s;hall do bet|ter another time.</HI></P>
<P>If we view the merit of a great man in the light of philo&s;ophy, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty gained more honour by this defeat, than he did by all his preceding victories. It made not the &s;malle&s;t alteration in his countenance or his manner; nor did it even interrupt the cour&s;e of his u&s;ual a|mu&s;ements. Far from di&s;gui&s;ing the indi&s;cretion of his own conduct, he acknowledged it in the face of all Europe, and did &s;uch ju&s;tice to the courage of his enemies, that he &s;eemed to envy Daun the glory of commanding &s;uch troops. His army &s;pent the night after the battle near the place where it was fought, and he formed an al|mo&s;t in&s;tantaneous re&s;olution of rai&s;ing the block|ade of Prague. Many obvious motives deter|mined him to that &s;tep; and among&s;t others was a &s;carcity of ammunition, occa&s;ioned by the ca|&s;ual blowing up of a large laboratory full of bombs. Though he had been on hor&s;eback and in perpetual action all the day of the battle, yet that very night he &s;et out for his camp before
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Prague, e&s;corted by no more than about a dozen Hu&s;&s;ars, with orders for his army to follow him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. This they did without being harra&s;&s;ed by the Au&s;trians, though the Pru&s;&s;ian lo&s;s in the late battle was near 8000 men, and all the Pru&s;&s;ian army, by a mo&s;t admirable di&s;po|&s;ition, drew off from before Prague, without any lo&s;s, and retreated towards Letomeritz.</P>
<P>By this time the army, called that of Execu|tion, was formed in the empire, with a view of executing the &s;entence of the diet of Rati&s;bon again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. This army was compo&s;ed of the troops of the Princes of the Empire, many of whom were Prote&s;tants; and &s;carcely any of them &s;atisfied as to the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e in which they fought; &s;o that the army in it&s;elf, which was commanded by the Prince of Saxe Hildbourghau&s;en was not formidable till it was joined by a large body of Au&s;trians, and by the French army under the Prince de Soubi&s;e, and then its numbers were double to tho&s;e of the Pru&s;&s;ians. All Europe now thought that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty mu&s;t be inevitably ruined; but he had re&s;ources in his own genius that placed him above the power of fortune. After his ar|rival at Letomeritz he omitted no opportunity of provoking Count Daun to a battle, and even made &s;ome de&s;perate efforts for that purpo&s;e; but the mechanical manner in which Daun carried on war defeated all his views. Leaving part of his army at Barn&s;tadel, under the Prince of Be|vern, he and Mar&s;hal Keith proceeded with the re&s;t to Erfurth, where they arrived the 14th of September. Upon this, the army of the empire retreated fir&s;t to Gotha, and then to Ei&s;enach, where it took &s;o advantageous a po&s;t, that he found it impracticable to force them to a battle.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="21">
In this &s;ituation of things, his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty bethought him&s;elf of one of tho&s;e happy expedients that are &s;o common among&s;t great Generals, that, if attended with di&s;appointment, bring no di&s;grace, and if with &s;ucce&s;s, immortal glory. Under pretext of being de&s;titute of pro|vi&s;ions, he retired to Naumburg, and &s;ent Mar|&s;hal Keith with &s;even battalions to Leip&s;ic. Af|ter this, he &s;eemed to throw him&s;elf quite off his guard, and &s;ent his troops into &s;uch quarters as could be&s;t afford them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but privately made &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition of them that he could a&s;|&s;emble them at a &s;hort warning. His enemies were not &s;o far impo&s;ed upon as not to imagine that he had &s;omething in view. But they mi&s;|took the object: they thought he intended to cover Magdeburgh, and that they in the mean time had a fair opportunity of reducing Leip&s;ic, which place they actually &s;ummoned Mar&s;hal Keith to &s;urrender. Keith probably was in his Ma&s;ter's &s;ecret, and made preparations for de|fending Leip&s;ic to the la&s;t extremity. The Im|periali&s;ts and the French made di&s;po&s;itions for be|&s;ieging it, which was the preci&s;e &s;ituation to which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty wanted to bring them. He was at this time to all appearance upon the brink of de&s;truction; but the reader will be&s;t judge of his &s;ituation, from a de&s;crip|tion of his per&s;on and condition printed at that time in the public papers as follows, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">Many per&s;ons who &s;aw the King of Pru&s;&s;ia when he pa&s;&s;ed lately through Leip&s;ic, cannot expre&s;s how much he is altered.

He is as much on hor&s;eback as Charles was, and

often lies upon the ground. His inward &s;uf|ferings cannot be le&s;s than his outward: let us ca&s;t our eyes on a map of the Pru&s;&s;ian do|minions, and mea&s;ure what he hath left of the many fair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he had in the month of April 1761, of which a &s;pace of &s;even months have &s;tripped him; whence can he have men? he is &s;hut out from the empire; and from whence can he draw money? the dutchy of Cleves, the principality of Muers, the county of Lingen, the county of Lip&s;tadt, the prin|cipality of Minden, Ea&s;t Frie&s;land, Embden, and its infant company, part of the rich bi|&s;hopric of Magdeburg, &s;ome other parts of the Marche, Ducal Pomerania, a great part of Sile&s;ia, a great part of the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, Berlin it&s;elf, and almo&s;t all his domi|nions are taken from him, or laid under con|tribution, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his enemies, who collect the public revenues, fatten on the con|tributions, and with the money which they draw from the electorate of Hanover, and other conque&s;ts, defray the expences of the war. This picture certainly differs greatly from that which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might have &s;ketched out the day he took arms to enter Saxony. Add to this the Duke of C&mdash;'s convention, which deprived him of all his allies, and left him without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance whatever, excepting 4 or 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, which the Briti&s;h parliament may give him. Add likewi&s;e &s;ome dome&s;tick un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es.</Q> Such was the picture exhibited of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty while his enemies were be&s;ieging Leip&s;ic, and when all of a &s;udden they received intelligence of his marching to its re|lief, his name was &s;o terrible that the Imperiali&s;ts retired over the Sala; but they were followed by
<PB N="20" REF="23">
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who had wi&s;ely declined to give them battle till almo&s;t the depth of win|ter, having provided for the &s;ecurity of all his pa&s;&s;es and fortre&s;&s;es in Sile&s;ia and Saxony. At la&s;t on the 5th of November, his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty came up with his enemies near a village called Ro&s;bach, and a battle being now inevi|table, he addre&s;&s;ed his troops in very near the following terms: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">My dear friends, you know the hour is come in which all that is, and all that ought to be dear to us, depends upon the &s;words which are now drawn for the battle. Time permits me to &s;ay but little; nor is there occa&s;ion to &s;ay much. You know that there is no labour, no hunger, no cold, no watch|ing, no danger, that I have not &s;hared with you hitherto; and you now &s;ee me ready to lay down my life with you, and for you. All I a&s;k, is, the &s;ame pledge of fidelity and af|fection that I give. And let me add, not as an incitement to your courage, but as a te&s;ti|mony of my own gratitude, that from this hour, until you go into quarters, your pay &s;hall be double: <HI>Acquit your&s;elves like men, and put your confidence in God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The &s;peech made by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, as before-mentioned, rendered the meane&s;t &s;oldier in his army an hero. Though they were but 25,000 &s;trong, and their enemies more than dou|ble that number, they called out to be led to ac|tion, in which they were headed by the King him&s;elf. The French cavalry at fir&s;t behaved well, and their infantry di&s;puted an eminence, which, if they could have maintained, would have given them great advantages; but nothing could with&s;tand the ardour of the Pru&s;&s;ians, who gained &s;o compleat a victory, that night alone &s;aved the French and
<PB N="21" REF="24">
Imperiali&s;ts from total de&s;truction; three thou|&s;and, however, were killed upon the field, 63 pieces of cannon, with a great number of co|lours, were taken, eight French Generals, 250 Officers, and 6000 common men were made pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>The victory compleat, and &s;eemingly deci&s;ive as it was, was far from giving any re&s;pite to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's military labours. The Au|&s;trians were &s;till &s;trong, and perhaps the &s;enti|ments of &s;ome of his own family did not entirely favour the &s;y&s;tem of his operations. Thus much at lea&s;t is certain, that he was di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of his Generals in Sile&s;ia, where, on the 11th of December, the Au&s;trians after a vi|gorous &s;iege reduced Schweidnitz, and obliged the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on, to the number of 4000, to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. After this, on the 22d of the &s;ame month, they attacked the Prince of Bevern's army, which, we have already men|tioned, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty left at Barn&s;tadel. The Prince lay then near Bre&s;lau, which was by this time inve&s;ted by the Au&s;trian General Nada&s;ti. There is &s;omewhat in the Prince of Bevern's conduct at this time, that requires to be touched by an Hi&s;torian with a tender hand. He gallantly repul&s;ed the Au&s;trians, who attacked him with great fury, and he even defeated them. It is po&s;&s;ible he, and the Generals under him, thought that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's affairs were irretrievable, and abandoning their &s;trong &s;itua|tion they pa&s;&s;ed the Oder, where the Prince of Bevern, riding out, on the pretext of reconnoi|tring, was made pri&s;oner by a body of Croats who had pa&s;&s;ed that river. After this, Bre&s;lau fell into the hands of the Au&s;trians, and it was thought they had nothing now to do but to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">
During this de&s;perate plunge of fortune, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty behaved with the &s;ame intre|pidity and coolne&s;s as he would have done had he been conquered. He was now in Lu&s;atia, and far from being terrified by the progre&s;s of his enemies, he made a war of diver&s;ion, by detach|ing Mar&s;hal Keith with part of his army into Bohemia, where he advanced almo&s;t as far as Prague, every where levying contributions.</P>
<P>He then entered Sile&s;ia, after a dreadful march of upwards of 200 miles, on the 2d of Decem|ber, at the head of not above 15,000 men, and when he was joined by the Prince of Be|vern's army, his whole force did not exceed 40,000, and tho&s;e greatly fatigued and harra&s;&s;ed. The Au&s;trians were at this time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp that had been &s;o unaccountably abandoned by the Prince of Bevern, and they were commanded by Count Daun, their num|bers being above 70,000 men. Upon his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty's arrival in Sile&s;ia, he was to his great, but agreeable &s;urprize, joined by the cap|tive garri&s;on of Schweidnitz, who, upon their hearing of his victory at Ro&s;bach, had ma&s;tered the e&s;cort which was conducting them to their pri&s;ons. Upon this, on the 5th of December, he came to a re&s;olution of giving Count Daun battle. The Au&s;trians by this time, tru&s;ting to the &s;uperiority of their numbers, were &s;o far from declining an engagement, that they quitted their &s;trong camp, and both armies met at the village of Leuthen. The ground which was there oc|cupied by the Au&s;trians was exce&s;&s;ively &s;trong, and &s;urrounded or inter&s;per&s;ed with eminences, on which were rai&s;ed batteries of cannon; they likewi&s;e had the precaution to fell down large trees to encumber the Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry, and Ge|neral
<PB N="23" REF="26">
Nada&s;ti commanded a corps de re&s;erve po&s;ted &s;o as to take the Pru&s;&s;ian army in flank.</P>
<P>The prodigious quickne&s;s and &s;agacity of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty made him obviate all the diffi|culties, numerous as they were, which he lay under. He &s;aw that great part of the for|tune of the day mu&s;t depend upon Nada&s;ti's attack, and he provided again&s;t it by plac|ing four battalions of infantry behind the cavalry of his right wing: and their fire was &s;o furious that they obliged the Au&s;trians to retreat. Upon this the Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry fell upon the enemy &s;word in hand, and their artillery being well &s;erved, the whole Au&s;trian army was broke, but not till after a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, e&s;peci|ally about the village of Leuthen, which they had endeavoured to render impregnable by re|doubts and entrenchments. Lo&s;ing that po&s;t, they fled with va&s;t confu&s;ion; 6000 were killed on the field of battle, 15,000 were taken pri&s;o|ners, and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty continued the pur|&s;uit as far as Li&s;&s;a. The Au&s;trian lo&s;s of artil|lery in this battle, which is called that of Bre&s;|lau, was about 200 pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>This victory of Bre&s;lau, which was obtained exactly a month after that of Ro&s;bach, was, if we except that of Minden, the mo&s;t amazing of any that has been fought the&s;e two centuries. Though it was in a &s;ea&s;on of the year in which other troops are indulged in winter quarters, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty on the 7th of December formed the &s;iege of Bre&s;lau, which, on the 20th of Ja|nuary &s;ucceeding 1758, &s;urrendered to him; the Au&s;trian garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 10,000 fighting men, be&s;ides 4000 &s;ick and wounded, becoming pri&s;oners of war. It would have been wor&s;e than madne&s;s after this, in &s;o rigorous a &s;ea&s;on, to have thought of be&s;ieging Schweidnitz, which
<PB N="24" REF="27">
was provided with a numerous Au&s;trian garri|&s;on. The return of Mar&s;hal Keith and his ar|my, loaded with the &s;poils of Bohemia and Sax|ony, completed his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's triumphs this year, and all Sile&s;ia, Schweidnitz excepted, now returned to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Nay, before he went into winter quarters, he reduced many places in it, belonging to the Empre&s;s Queen.&mdash;Having thus brought the Pru&s;&s;ian operations of 1757 to a clo&s;e, I am now to attend tho&s;e in which Great Britain was more immediately intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>His late Maje&s;ty King George the Second, in point of good faith, was, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t &s;crupulous Princes that ever lived. Though he knew the ju&s;tice on which his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty's inva&s;ion of Saxony was founded; yet as it did not immediately concern him&s;elf, either as a member of the empire, or as King of Great Britain, he was &s;o far from giving it any coun|tenance, that he ordered his mini&s;ter at the Saxon court to do every thing that was in his power to &s;often the rigour of his Poli&s;h Maje&s;|ty's fate. But King George the Second, who of him&s;elf always thought and acted as a King and a man, had contemporary Princes to deal with, who li&s;tened more to the voice of re&s;entment, than to that of rea&s;on; nor perhaps upon certain occa&s;ions can be entirely clear even his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty of that charge. Thus much at lea&s;t is certain, that had his Britannic Maje&s;ty's voice been heard, a &s;top might have been put to the horrors of war, about the beginning of the year 1757; but the &s;ore was more fe&s;tered than he or the public apprehended. The French, fatally for them&s;elves and all Europe, imagined, that his Britannic Maje&s;ty never would be proof again&s;t an attack upon his electoral dominions;
<PB N="25" REF="28">
and that they &s;hould be able in Germany to e&s;ta|bli&s;h their encroachments upon the continent of America. Our taking the French &s;hips without a formal declaration of war, though a &s;tep that had no manner of relation to his Maje&s;ty's con|duct as Elector of Hanover, &s;erved them as a pretext for invading that country, and his Pru&s;&s;i|an Maje&s;ty's irruption into Saxony, gave them as guarantees of the treaty of We&s;tphalia, &s;ome colour of ju&s;tice in the eyes of the re&s;t of Eu|rope. They demanded a pa&s;&s;age from the Dutch for their warlike &s;tores through Namur and Mac|&s;tricht, which, notwith&s;tanding our oppo&s;ition, was granted them, and about the end of March 1757, they rendezvou&s;ed at Nuys, oppo&s;ite to Du&s;&s;eldorp. Upon their entering Germany they met with little or no oppo&s;ition, and even the &s;trong town of We&s;el belonging to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, fell into their hands. They rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time va&s;t contributions, and blockaded the town of Gueldres. Their army, amounting to above 110,000 men, was commanded by the Mar&s;hal D'Etrees, who was then reckoned to be the be&s;t General France had, and in a very &s;hort time, they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Pru&s;&s;ian Guelderland, the dutchy of Cleves, and all his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's e&s;tates upon the Rhine.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this formidable progre&s;s of the French, his Britannic Maje&s;ty's delicacy, in point of good faith, would not &s;uffer him to take the lea&s;t &s;tep that could carry the &s;malle&s;t appear|ance of violating the peace of Germany. All the u&s;e he made of his connections in the empire, was to form an army of ob&s;ervation, the com|mand of which was given to his royal highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland, who arrived in Ger|many early in the &s;pring of 1757, and took po&s;t with about 40,000 He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians in

the Pru&s;&s;ian territories of Raven&s;burg. D'Etrees, who had the flower of the French Generals to command under him, ridiculou&s;ly demanded a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age through the Hanoverian dominions to march again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, though it would have co&s;t him a detour of many hundred miles. This demand being rejected, the French army advanced again&s;t that of ob&s;ervation to|wards Bielefield, the Duke of Cumberland's head quarters.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for a writer to make the &s;ub|&s;equent operations of his royal highne&s;s compre|hen&s;ible to a candid reader, without touching up|on the civil hi&s;tory of the times, which with &s;ome reluctance, I am now obliged to do. The eyes of the Germanic body were at this time fixed upon the parliament and mini&s;try of Great Bri|tain; neither of whom were very forward in ex|tending their German connections. Whatever private convictions the mini&s;try might have as to the expediency of defending Hanover, the topic was &s;o unpopular that few of them cared to avow their &s;entiments. His Britannic Maje&s;ty &s;aw this with &s;ome concern, nor dur&s;t he venture to give either his Hanoverian regency or the Princes of the empire, who were in his intere&s;t, any po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance of their being &s;upported by Great Bri|tain. Hanover was but a feeble object, when oppo&s;ed to an army of 110,000 men, and it was natural for his Maje&s;ty to li&s;ten to the repre&s;enta|tions of his mini&s;ters there, who advi&s;ed him to a neutrality if it could be obtained. This being premi&s;ed, the conduct of his royal highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland will appear not only intel|ligible, but &s;o far as related to him&s;elf, magnani|mous and defen&s;ible upon every principle of ju&s;|tice and prudence.</P>

About the 13th of June, the French army ap|proached to Bielefield, and notwith&s;tanding its va&s;t &s;uperiority of numbers, his royal highne&s;s did not pa&s;s the We&s;er till the 19th. While the two armies continued on the oppo&s;ite banks of the We&s;er, the French took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Embden and all the Pru&s;&s;ian territories in Ea&s;t Frie&s;land, as they did of the country of Bentheim, which had been purcha&s;ed by his Britannic Maje&s;ty in the year 1752. After garri&s;oning tho&s;e acqui&s;i|tions, the French detachments returned to their main army under d'Etrees, who being an able General knew the inconveniencies the Duke of Cumberland was under to guard all the pa&s;&s;ages of the We&s;er, and prepared to pa&s;s that river at Hoxter, at a large di&s;tance from the Duke's army. The apparent con&s;equence of which was the laying all the &s;outhern parts of Hanover under contribution. His royal highne&s;s, not|with&s;tanding the prodigious odds of numbers, made mo&s;t excellent di&s;po&s;itions for oppo&s;ing his enemies, and at la&s;t, after a mo&s;t judicious choice of ground, he encamped at Ha&s;tenbeck near Ha|melen. The French attacked the rear of the ar|my of ob&s;ervation, in which they were &s;everal times defeated, and the Duke having pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, the Marqui&s;s d'Etrees, the French Ge|neral, found him&s;elf under great difficulties in forcing him to a battle. After &s;everal marches and countermarches, in which the Duke's army was neither numerous enough to attend him, and far le&s;s to guard all the exten&s;ive banks of the ri|ver, the Marqui&s;s d'Armentieres, while his roy|al highne&s;s was intent upon the motions of the Duke de Broglio and Mon&s;ieur Chevert, on the 9th of July threw bridges over the river at Hox|ter, and pa&s;&s;ed it with a large detachment of troops and artillery. He was followed by the Duke of
<PB N="28" REF="31">
Orleans, and then by d'Etrees and all the French army. This, together with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el to M. Contades, enabled the French to extend their contributi|ons; and on the 25th of July, they attacked the Hanoverians at Ha&s;tenbeck, where the mo&s;t com|plete general&s;hip &s;hewn on the part of his royal highne&s;s, which was admired by his enemies them&s;elves, did not give him victory. He was obliged to retire after the lo&s;s of about 1500 men, that of the enemy being greater, by the way of Hamelen, Nyenburg, and Hoy, till he came to Ferden. The French followed him, but very &s;lowly, and forced the garri&s;on of Hamelen to capitulate. They had &s;everal rea&s;ons for this de|lay. They did not chu&s;e to pre&s;s too hard upon an army which had been &s;o little dimini&s;hed by the late battle; they knew that a great part of the Hanoverian regency were inclined to a neu|trality, but above all, the arrival of the Duke de Richelieu, who &s;uperceded M. d'Etrees in his command, retarded their march. Richelieu, a rapacious expen&s;ive Officer, had, by the influ|ence of the French King's mi&s;tre&s;s, obtained that command to repair his broken fortunes, and he made the mo&s;t of it by his acts of oppre&s;&s;ion and plunder.</P>
<P>He &s;ent the Duke de Randan to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the city of Hanover with 2000 men, which he did without re&s;i&s;tance, and was appoint|ed to be its governor; but all the trea&s;ure, ar|chives, and effects, had been before &s;ent to Stade. Richelieu, at the &s;ame time, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the other con&s;iderable places of the electorate, and ordered its &s;everal divi&s;ions to &s;end deputies to his camp, to &s;ettle the mode and proportion of the contributions they were to furni&s;h. After thus collecting his army, he marched towards
<PB N="62" REF="32" MS="y">
Ferden, as his royal highne&s;s did to a &s;trong camd between Otter&s;berg and Rothenburg. The French, by their &s;uperiority of numbers, were en|abled to make di&s;po&s;itions which might have cut off the communication of his royal highne&s;s with Stade, the mo&s;t important fortification in all the electorate, and this obliged him to retire with his army under the cannon of that place.</P>
<P>It was generally thought that his &s;ituation, as he could retire no further, mu&s;t have brought on a battle, which, every thing con&s;idered, mu&s;t have been deci&s;ive in his favour. But it was otherwi&s;e re&s;olved upon in the Hanoverian coun|cils, which had prevailed upon the King of Den|mark to employ the Count de Lynar to mediate a convention between the two armies, which was &s;igned at Clo&s;ter-Seven, and by which the Ha|noverian army was bound up from ho&s;tilities, and was &s;ent into different cantonments in their own country. This convention left Richelieu at li|berty to tyrannize over all that electorate, which he did in the mo&s;t inhuman, rapacious, manner; though we mu&s;t do the Duke de Randan the ju&s;|tice to &s;ay, that his conduct in his government was directly the rever&s;e of that of Richelieu: for which he received the thanks of his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The reader, from what is before &s;aid, may gue&s;s at the &s;ecret cau&s;es that produced the &s;urpri&s;ing convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven. It is certain, that neither his royal highne&s;s nor the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were privy to them. The latter, ever &s;ince the French had entered We&s;tphalia, had fore&s;een the expediency of giving them a diver&s;ion in their own country, and that &s;ame &s;ummer, 1757, a powerful armament for a &s;ecret expedition was fitted out in England. The de&s;ign was &s;o well concealed, that the mo&s;t penetrating
<PB N="30" REF="33">
politicians were at a lo&s;s to account for its object, and the chief command of the expedition was gi|ven to Lieutenant General Sir John Mordaunt, under whom &s;erved the Major Generals, Con|way and Cornwallis, with about 6000 land troops on board. On the 21&s;t of September, this ar|mament appeared off Rochfort, and &s;oon after, the &s;mall i&s;le of Aix was reduced by the Briti&s;h &s;hipping. From the fortifications of this i&s;land the coa&s;ts and &s;ituation of the country was atten|tively ob&s;erved, and &s;ome of the Briti&s;h officers imagined they di&s;covered two encampments. This produced di&s;putes and doubts among the officers, which were heightened by the apparent difficulties of landing, but all agreed in the expe|diency of taking a &s;mall fort, called Fort Fouras, in order to &s;ecure their retreat. This attack was neglected; but it was re&s;olved to land the troops in boats on the 28th of September. The weather being &s;omewhat boi&s;terous, (tho' it did not appear to be &s;o for three days before) the troops, after being put into the boats, were ordered to reim|bark. Sir Edward Hawke, who commanded the fleet, grew unea&s;y at its &s;ituation at that time of the year, and it was re&s;olved, but without any regular, or general, meeting of the council of war, that the whole expedition &s;hould return to Eng|land, without making any further attempt. The con&s;ternation of the people and parliament, after the lo&s;s of their money, and what is &s;till more, of their national reputation, was inexpre&s;&s;ible. His Maje&s;ty referred the ca&s;e of the commanding offi|cer to a board of general officers, and in con&s;e|quence of their report, he was tried at a general court martial, held at Whitehall the 14th of December 1757, and acquitted upon the dubiety of the evidence which was again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">
The public of England had now a di&s;agreeable pro&s;pect before its eyes. The army of ob&s;ervati|on had been rendered inactive; and thus there was no co-operating power to take off the weight of the French arms from his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who appeared to be in a mo&s;t melancholy &s;ituation. The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, his irreconcileable ene|my, ordered her troops to quicken their motions, and they entered the Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, under Mar|&s;hal Apraxin and General Fermer, where they were guilty of mon&s;trous inhumanities. An Au&s;|trian army penetrated as far as Bre&s;law into Sile|&s;ia, and laid &s;iege to Schweidnitz, while another body reduced Zittau. The Swedes, to the num|ber of 22,000, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the towns of Anclam and Demmein, in the Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, and laid the neighbouring country un|der contribution, as Richelieu, being now ea&s;y on the &s;ide of Hanover, did the old Marche of Brandenburg, which, however, did not ex|cu&s;e the inhabitants from being plundered where|ever the French came. As the recovering of Sile&s;ia was the main object of the Empre&s;s Queen, the army of the empire was joined by that of the French, under Prince Soubi&s;e, and marched to|wards Saxony, which left Sile&s;ia expo&s;ed to all the Au&s;trian force, &s;o that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia dur&s;t not venture to defend even his capital Ber|lin, which was entered and laid under contribu|tion by General Haddick. The Ru&s;&s;ians, tho' intent only upon their own views, &s;till encrea&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;s of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. His Gene|ral Lehwald had orders at all hazards to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, and with no more than 50,000 men, he attacked above double that number at Norkittin, on the 30th of Augu&s;t 1757. The Ru&s;&s;ians may be cut to pieces, but it can &s;eldom be &s;aid, they are beaten. Though they lo&s;t five
<PB N="32" REF="35">
men for one that fell on the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ide, yet Lehwald was obliged to retire, which he did with great reputation to him&s;elf, and the arms of his ma&s;ter. Notwith&s;tanding the amazing exertions of valour and conduct daily made by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, all Europe, not excepting even his friends in England, thought him now to be at the la&s;t ga&s;p. He had lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dut|chies of Gueldres and Cleves, the principalities of Muers and Munden, with the counties of Lingen and Lip&s;tadt; Ea&s;t Frie&s;land, Embden, part of Magdeburg, and the Marche, the Du|cal Pomerania, great part of Sile&s;ia, and Regal Pru&s;&s;ia. Conque&s;ts, that while they took from him the means of carrying on the war, gave them to his enemies. His chief means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance re&s;ted on his Briti&s;h &s;ub&s;idy; but that, though great, was not only inadequate to his nece&s;&s;ities, but precarious in it&s;elf. The unaccountable fai|lure of the expedition again&s;t Rochfort had &s;oured the nation, and it was uncertain into who&s;e hands the mini&s;try was to fall.</P>
<P>But the juncture in which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was thought to be the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, rendered him formidable. He had by an admirable train of operations covered Saxony; but when the army of the empire, and that of Soubi&s;e advanced to the frontiers of Mi&s;nia, and &s;eemed to point to|wards the &s;iege of Leip&s;ic, he put his troops in motion, after taking all po&s;&s;ible precautions again&s;t the Au&s;trians in Lu&s;atia, and for the defence of Schweidnitz. The Imperiali&s;ts knew what great things his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was capable of, and they retired at his approach; till having rein|forced them&s;elves with a va&s;t &s;uperiority of numbers, they again faced his army, and he in his turn retired. It was now the 24th of Octo|ber, and he had &s;ecretly determined on a battle,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
but found great difficulties in bringing it on with advantage to him&s;elf. To effect this, he can|toned his troops in &s;uch a manner as to per&s;uade his enemies, from the di&s;tance between their corps, that he intended to act only on the defen&s;ive, during the remaining part of the winter; but on the 27th of October, to the amazement of his enemies, &s;o quickly had his troops advanced, he was at the head of 25,000 choice men.</P>
<P>Though the convention of Clo&s;ter Seven was equally binding upon the French as upon the Ha|noverians, yet the former behaved with all the in&s;olence of tyrants over &s;laves. The rapaciou&s;|ne&s;s of the Duke de Richelieu knew no bounds, one cruel exaction followed another, but though all was &s;ubmitted to, the wretched inhabitants found no relief from plundering and pillaging. Money, and booty was all that Richelieu had in view, nor indeed dur&s;t he repre&s;s the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of his &s;oldiers, which not only carried them beyond all the bounds of military di&s;cipline, but led them into habits of life, that proved fatal to them, in the di&s;ea&s;es they introduced, attended with va&s;t mortality; while their General and o|ther Commanders, mindful only of enriching them&s;elves, neither provided for their recovery, nor furni&s;hed them with arms, cloaths, or any means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, but what they acquired by plunder. Richelieu was &s;en&s;ible of his army's growing weakne&s;s, and to guard again&s;t the ef|fects of it, he required the He&s;&s;ians and Hano|verians to deliver up their arms, a condition that had not been &s;tipulated by the convention of Clo&s;|ter Seven. He pu&s;hed the breach of tho&s;e articles &s;till further, by attempting to &s;eize upon places not comprehended in them, and by &s;hutting them up in &s;uch narrow di&s;tricts of cantonment, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for the inhabitants to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.
<PB N="34" REF="37">
The revenues of the electorate was farmed out to one Faidy, a money-undertaker, under pre|tence of its being a conquered country, and he &s;et up a booth at Hanover by virtue of his com|mi&s;&s;ion, which impowered him to commit what exce&s;&s;es he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, and many other oppre&s;&s;ions, con|vinced the regency of Hanover, how greatly they were mi&s;taken, in imagining, that the conven|tion of Clo&s;ter Seven would bring any relief to their country. It fortunately happened, that the court of Ver&s;ailles refu&s;ed to con&s;ider the conven|tion, as being obligatory upon her, unle&s;s the auxiliary troops of Hanover were di&s;armed, and unle&s;s his Britannic Maje&s;ty would abandon his electorate as a prey to the French. Tho&s;e de|mands, therefore, in fact, freed his Britannic Maje&s;ty, as much as it did France, from looking upon the convention as being obligatory, and he could no longer re&s;i&s;t the voice of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects. He appointed Prince Ferdinand, the brother of the reigning Duke of Brun&s;wic, to be his General, and the battle of Ro&s;bach critically happening at the &s;ame time, the Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians re&s;umed their arms, united under him, and broke from their di&s;graceful confinements. The French were in no condition to re&s;i&s;t the &s;pirit of liberty, enflamed by re&s;entment. They were every where beaten. The Hanoverians took the town of Harburg, and the gallant re&s;i&s;t|ance made by the ca&s;tle, which at la&s;t was re|duced likewi&s;e, was the only in&s;tance, in which the French could be &s;aid to act like &s;oldiers or men. Prince Ferdinand then retreated to Ultzen, half way between Zell and Lunenburg, and Broglio having pa&s;&s;ed the Aller with a large body of cavalry, the Hanoverians expected every mo|ment to be attacked. But the movements of the
<PB N="35" REF="38">
French proved to be only a feint to cover &s;ome waggons of Richelieu's ill gotten plunder, and they fell back upon their head-quarters at Zell. We &s;hall now attend the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>The army under Apraxin had behaved with &s;uch unexampled brutality, that in de&s;olating the countries, through which it marched, they left no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves; and the court of Vienna had been &s;o &s;low in its remittances, that the troops, both officers and &s;oldiers, being great|ly in arrear, they took a re&s;olution to evacuate the Pru&s;&s;ian territories, which, to the amazement of all Europe, they accordingly did. His Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who at fir&s;t &s;carcely believed the news, upon this, ordered Lehwald to march his army into Pomerania again&s;t the Swedes. Leh|wald, on entering that country, &s;carce met with re&s;i&s;tance from a people, who&s;e military virtues, but a few years before, had &s;truck terror into all Europe. He not only drove them out of the Pru&s;|&s;ian Pomerania, but took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Swedi&s;h, excepting Stral&s;und, under the cannon of which, the Swedi&s;h army took &s;helter. The Duke of Mecklenburgh Schwerin, who, during all the war, had &s;hewn a remarkable attachment to the French, being, by the retreat of the Ru&s;|&s;ians and Swedes, left expo&s;ed to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's re&s;entment, was obliged to take &s;helter at Lubec; and it is to be lamented, that his &s;ub|jects, though Prote&s;tants, paid dearly for the mi&s;|conduct of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>The enemies of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia were more &s;trongly united again&s;t him by fear and hatred than they would have been either by intere&s;t or principle. The bloody events and various for|tunes of the la&s;t campaign, &s;uch as never before happened in &s;o &s;hort a time, had not di&s;po&s;ed any of the powers at war to make &s;o much as a pro|po&s;al
<PB N="36" REF="39">
for peace. That the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might give &s;ome repo&s;e to his troops, the campaign did not open till the beginning of April, 1758. The con&s;equences of the battle of Li&s;&s;a had been extremely favourable to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as by the contributions he rai&s;ed in Saxony and other places, he was enabled to &s;pare his Heredi|tary countries, and to &s;end a &s;mall body of caval|ry to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Prince Ferdinand. The Count de Clermont had now the command of the French army in We&s;tphalia. But the change of the General did them no &s;ervice. They retreated or rather fled every where before the Hanoveri|ans, who marched in two divi&s;ions; one on the right to the country of Bremen, and another un|der General Za&s;trow, to the left towards Gifforn. In a few days the French retired from Otter&s;burg, Bremen, and Ferden, and the ca&s;tle of Rotten|burg did not hold out above &s;ix hours. It was expected that Count Chabot, who was po&s;ted with a &s;trong detachment at Hoy above Ferden, would have made a vigorous &s;tand; and Prince Ferdinand appointed his nephew, the young Prince of Brun&s;wick, with four battalions of foot and &s;ome light-hor&s;e, to di&s;lodge him. This Prince, though but twenty years of age, had &s;een a great deal of action, and his genius was &s;o truly military, that he had performed exploits which would have done honour to the able&s;t Generals. He had &s;ignalized him&s;elf at the battle of Ha&s;|tenbeck, and &s;uch was his ardour for glory in a noble cau&s;e, that he had, though with the &s;eem|ing di&s;approbation of his father, followed his uncle to the field. The enterprize he was charg|ed with was not only full of difficulties, but a train of di&s;appointments threatened to render it un&s;ucce&s;sful. Having a broad river to pa&s;s, and but one float to carry his troops over it, and the
<PB N="37" REF="40">
wind blowing fre&s;h in his teeth, he found it im|practicable to pa&s;s over but one half of his de|tachment. It was now the 23d of February, and he boldly, but wi&s;ely, determined to &s;urprize the town before it was day-light &s;ufficient for the French to di&s;cover the &s;mall handful he was at|tended with. Before he was arrived at the town, the enemy was alarmed by an accidental firing, and prepared to receive him; but the Prince by his courage and excellent di&s;po&s;itions conquered all oppo&s;ition. He beat the enemy from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a bridge they held, took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the town, and forced Chabot, the French commandant, who had thrown him&s;elf into the ca&s;tle, to &s;urrender it with all his &s;tores and magazines. The Prince, who had with him no heavy artillery, &s;uffered the troops under Chabot to depart, but he had in the preceding action killed a great number of the enemy, and made almo&s;t 700 pri&s;oners, with no more than 100 of his own men killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The Hanoverian army continuing its march in two divi&s;ions, at la&s;t cleared all the electorate of the French, Minden excepted, which was garri&s;oned by 4000 men; but the place being in|ve&s;ted, they were obliged on March the 14th to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, after a &s;iege of no more than nine days. It does not fall within the narrow compa&s;s of our de&s;ign to par|ticularize the many &s;kirmi&s;hes that all this while pa&s;&s;ed between the French and the Hanoverians. The former &s;carce made a re&s;i&s;tance but when they were prompted by de&s;pair, and even then it was ineffectual. All &s;ubordination was lo&s;t a|mong&s;t their troops. De&s;titute of cloathing and covering in a bitter &s;ea&s;on many peri&s;hed on the roads, and the &s;word was &s;carcely wanted to fi|ni&s;h the de&s;truction of the &s;urvivors, mo&s;t of whom were &s;o weak and di&s;ea&s;ed, that they were
<PB N="38" REF="41">
knocked on the head by the clubs of the enraged pea&s;ants, while the Hanoverian Hu&s;&s;ars and Hun|ters harra&s;&s;ed the few who had &s;trength enough to attempt an e&s;cape. Upon the whole, it is reck|oned at a moderate computation, that, of 130,000 French, who had entered We&s;tphalia, all of them fine troops, not above 50,000 were alive at the end of the campaign. The&s;e being collec|ted together from all quarters, at la&s;t reached the Rhine, except a body which maintained it&s;elf at We&s;el, under count Clermont. We mu&s;t, how|ever, from the &s;cene of French oppre&s;&s;ion and barbarity we have exhibited, except the conduct of the Duke de Randan, who pre&s;erved his vir|tue and humanity, even amid&s;t all the horros and provocations of this di&s;mal retreat. Though he had large magazines, far from de&s;troying them, as the cu&s;tom of common war might have ju&s;ti|fied him in doing, he con&s;igned them to the Ha|noverian magi&s;tracy for the benefit of their poor, and that, by his pre&s;ence, he might prevent all di&s;orders, he was the la&s;t Frenchman, who marched out of Hanover.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit of de&s;pondency &s;eemed to in|fect the French troops in other places. A &s;mall Engli&s;h &s;quadron under Commodore Holmes ar|rived before Embden, which, as we mentioned before, was taken from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by the French, and, by them, garri&s;oned with 4000 men, and cut off the communication between the place and the mouth of the river. The gar|ri&s;on, either &s;truck with a panic, or apprehend|ing that Holmes expected a &s;peedy &s;upply of &s;hips and troops, evacuated the town, and &s;ent their heavy artillery and baggag up the river. Holmes ordered &s;ome armed boats to pur&s;ue them, and &s;ome of their ve&s;&s;els were taken. In one of them was a youth, the &s;on of a French officer of di&s;|tinction,
<PB N="39" REF="42">
whom the Commodore immediately &s;ent to his father, and offered to &s;end him the money too, upon his giving his word and honour that it was his own property. We mention this circum&s;tance, becau&s;e it is the duty of hi&s;tory to do ju&s;tice to private, as well as public, virtue.</P>
<P>Though the French in the &s;pace of a few months had &s;u&s;tained almo&s;t incredible lo&s;&s;es in Germany, yet we are not with &s;ome writers to repre&s;ent them as being at this time a ruined people. Their councils, it is true, were not only divided but un|&s;teady and infirm. All reciprocal confidence had been lo&s;t between their court and parliaments, and the able&s;t of their mini&s;ters had with indig|nation retired from public bu&s;ine&s;s. Notwith|&s;tanding this, France was &s;till internally power|ful, and had prodigious re&s;ources. The &s;lighte&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ions, on the part of her King, gave &s;pirit to her people, and even the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;uffered &s;erved to animate them with a pa&s;&s;ion to repair them. The Duke de Bellei&s;le, &s;o famous for his exploits civil as well as military, was pointed out by the public voice, as the only mi|ni&s;ter who could prevent farther di&s;graces, and the French King accordingly put him at the head of the war-department, to the general &s;atisfaction of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>England pre&s;ented a very different &s;cene. The admini&s;tration there was popular. A harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the court and parliament, and between the parliament and people, circum&s;tan|ces which were almo&s;t unprecedented in hi&s;tory. The few inte&s;tine divi&s;ions that &s;till prevailed were &s;wallowed up in a univer&s;al admiration of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's virtues and victories, after the train of di&s;tre&s;&s;es he had undergone. This made it &s;afe for the mini&s;try thoroughly to adopt a new &s;y&s;tem, in which there otherwi&s;e would
<PB N="40" REF="43">
have been &s;ome danger to them&s;elves. The de&s;ign met with little oppo&s;ition either without or with|in doors, becau&s;e, they who really inclined to op|po&s;e it, though a con&s;iderable party in parliament, thought it would be to no purpo&s;e, and that it would expo&s;e them to the odium of the public. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had hitherto received only occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tances from Great Britain; but on the 11th of April, 1758, a convention was con|cluded between him and his Britannic Maje&s;ty, by which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was to receive 670,000l. &s;terling a year from Great Britain; and the contracting parties mutually engaged, that one &s;hould not make peace without the other. Some thought there was danger to Great Bri|tain, in thus becoming as much a principal as Pru&s;&s;ia it&s;elf, in a continental war, and the Bri|ti&s;h mini&s;ters them&s;elves perhaps did not fore&s;ee the con&s;equences that have &s;ince happened, or that the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia would prove &s;o intrac|table as &s;he did. The retreat of her troops was con&s;idered as a prelude to an alteration of her conduct; but the public were &s;oon undeceived in that re&s;pect. Apraxin was di&s;po&s;ted and put un|der arre&s;t, as was Be&s;tucheff her Imperial Maje&s;|ty's fir&s;t mini&s;ter, for countenancing the retreat, and the command of the army was given to the Generals, Brown and Fermer. In Sweden the flagrant di&s;grace her arms had &s;u&s;tained, &s;eemed to encrea&s;e the animo&s;ity of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;|ty's enemies again&s;t him, and without con&s;ulting the King, the Senate came to a re&s;olution of pro&s;ecuting the war with more vigour than ever.</P>
<P>After the reduction of Schweidnitz, which &s;ur|rendered April the 16th, 1758, his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty had no enemies within his dominions. His credit was now high, and his armies &s;trong. He had a body of troops commanded by Count
<PB N="41" REF="44">
Dohna, on the &s;ide of Pomerania, which over|awed the Swedes and Mecklenburghers. Sile&s;ia was covered by another body, po&s;ted between Wohlau and Glogau, while an army of 30 bat|talions and 45 &s;quadrons was formed in Saxony, under the command of Prince Henry, his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty's brother, to face the army of the empire, which was again become formidable; and tho&s;e armies were all &s;o judiciou&s;ly po&s;ted, that each had a communication with the other. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's affairs wearing &s;o promi&s;|ing an a&s;pect, he re&s;olved upon an offen&s;ive war, and to make the untouched country of Moravia its theatre. To conceal his de&s;ign, after the re|duction of Schweidnitz, he ordered &s;ome troops to take po&s;t as if he intended to invade Bohemia, but all of a &s;udden making a rapid march, he opened trenches before the city of Olmutz, the barrier of Moravia, on the 27th of May. We may perhaps venture to &s;ay that the flattering pro&s;pect of carrying the war to the gates of Vi|enna was his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's main motive in this expedition, which at fir&s;t threw the Au&s;trian councils into va&s;t perplexity. Mar&s;hal Daun was then in Lu&s;atia, but marching through Bo|hemia, he took the command of the army that was to oppo&s;e his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, and po&s;ted him&s;elf between Gewitz and Littau, by which &s;ituation he had at his back the fruitful country of Bohemia, and could by his parties intercept the Pru&s;&s;ian convoys from Sile&s;ia. It &s;oon ap|peared that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had not &s;uffici|ently con&s;idered the difficulties attending his ex|pedition. Olmutz was a city of &s;uch extent, that his troops were not numerous enough compleatly to inve&s;t it: &s;o that Daun was ena|bled to &s;upply it with provi&s;ions and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for making a vigorous defence, and he
<PB N="42" REF="45">
never &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;o compleat a General as he then did. Perceiving that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;|ty had taken a fal&s;e &s;tep, he availed him&s;elf of it to the utmo&s;t; and took &s;uch mea&s;ures, that his royal antagoni&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all his endea|vours and provocations, perceived it was imprac|ticable to force him to a battle. In the mean while, the be&s;ieged plied the Pru&s;&s;ians with ince&s;|&s;ant &s;allies, by which they ruined their works, and nailed up their cannon, not to mention their lo&s;s of men. As to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, his &s;i|tuation was &s;uch, that by the neighbourhood of Daun's army, he found him&s;elf unable to employ above 10,000 men upon the &s;iege, and they were in a manner them&s;elves be&s;ieged by the enemy. The country about Olmutz afforded them no &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, all having been de&s;troyed by the Au&s;tri|ans; and to complete the King's misfortune, Daun lay as near to Sile&s;ia as he did, and by means of the country people, he was admirably well &s;erved with intelligence. Hearing that a great Pru&s;|&s;ion convoy was arrived at Troppau, he &s;truck a blow which proved him to be a General of en|terprize as well as caution. He ordered two de|tachments from two very different places, Mug|litz and Prerau, to put them&s;elves in motion, and pre&s;cribed them &s;uch regulations for their march as that they &s;hould come up at the &s;ame time &s;o as to attack the convoy on both &s;ides. To favour this manoeuvre, Daun made di&s;po&s;itions as if he intended to fight the Pru&s;&s;ian army under the King, who had left the command of the &s;iege to Field-Mar&s;hal Keith. This &s;udden change in Daun's operations, gave the King &s;ome &s;u&s;pici|ons, and he &s;ent a body of troops under General Ziethen to &s;upport his convoy. Ziethen came too late to prevent its being attacked, but it had repelled the Au&s;trians. The latter, however,
<PB N="43" REF="46">
were reinforced by Daun with fre&s;h troops, who renewed the engagement next day, defeated Zie|then, &s;eized on the centre of the convoy, while the rear precipitately retired to Troppau, and but few of the Van reached the Pru&s;&s;ian camp.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment of the convoy before mentioned, was fatal to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's a&s;piring views: July was now drawing on, and he had thrown away a mo&s;t precious part of the &s;ummer in un&s;ucce&s;sful operations, without hav|ing it in his power, &s;o judicious were the mea|&s;ures of his enemy, to di&s;play either courage or general&s;hip. The Ru&s;&s;ians had again taken the field, and their Co&s;&s;acks and Calmucks, were as u&s;ual, making cruel incur&s;ions into Sile&s;ia, and Berlin it&s;elf was threatened. Such was his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty's &s;ituation, when he took the &s;ecret, but unwilling, re&s;olution of rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Olmutz. By this time Daun had made a motion to Po&s;nitz, which mu&s;t have laid the Pru&s;&s;ians under &s;till greater difficulties, and might have not only rai&s;ed the &s;iege, but have ruined their army. Be&s;et with &s;o many dangers, his Maje&s;ty, by an uncommon effort of genius, in&s;tead of retiring, re&s;olved to advance into his enemies dominions, a re&s;olution equally wi&s;e and bold. Perceiving that Daun by the change of his &s;ituation had left Bohemia uncovered, he ordered on the la&s;t of July the &s;iege to be carried on with more bri&s;k|ne&s;s than ever, but on the night of the &s;ame day his whole army took the road of Bohemia, gain|ed 24 hours march of the Au&s;trians, defeated all the parties that attempted to oppo&s;e him, &s;eized upon a grand magazine at Leutomi&s;&s;el, and ar|rived at the important po&s;t of Konig&s;gratz in Bohemia with all his waggons, baggage, artil|lery and military &s;tores, and after defeating 7000 Au&s;trians who lay entrenched before it, he took
<PB N="44" REF="47">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place. All Europe was &s;ur|prized that he avail'd him&s;elf of this important conque&s;t no farther than by laying it and the neighbouring country under contribution. But the danger his hereditary dominions were in from the Ru&s;&s;ians ju&s;tified his again evacuating Bohe|mia and marching towards Sile&s;ia, where he un|der&s;tood that his barbarous enemies had entered the New Marche of Brandenburg, and laid &s;iege to the important fortre&s;s of Cu&s;trin.</P>
<P>Though Great Britain had hitherto &s;ent but a few troops to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Prince Ferdinand in Germany, yet her mini&s;try had made ince&s;|&s;ant efforts for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the French. The fears of inva&s;ion lay &s;o heavy upon the &s;pirits of the people, that her mini&s;try found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to remove them. The Briti&s;h Councils for &s;ome time fluctuated between two mea&s;ures propo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. The one was to &s;end a &s;trong body of troops to act in conjunction with Prince Ferdinand in Germany: The other was to alarm the &s;ea coa&s;ts of France by frequent de&s;cents upon them. The fir&s;t pro|po&s;al was thought too much to break in upon the anticontinental plan our Mini&s;ters had adopted, and the latter was e&s;pou&s;ed upon three principles. The fir&s;t was, that &s;uch de&s;cents would oblige the French to divide their forces and to weaken their army in Germany, in order to guard the va&s;t extent of their &s;ea coa&s;ts. The &s;econd was, that it would employ the natural &s;trength of Great-Britain, her marine, which would give &s;atisfaction to all parties among&s;t us. And the third, that it would prove that the French were vulnerable in their own dominions, and mu&s;t there|fore lay a&s;ide all thoughts of invading ours.</P>
<P>Though we are little di&s;po&s;ed to enter into po|litical di&s;qui&s;itions, yet we cannot help &s;aying
<PB N="45" REF="48">
that the two fir&s;t principles &s;eem to have been mi&s;taken. A nation like France, that can bring into the field, exclu&s;ive of militia, 300,000 men, is not to be diverted from its main object by &s;o incon&s;iderable a force as we propo&s;ed to em|ploy again&s;t it. The marine of Great-Britain was indeed exerted, but in a very di&s;advantage|ous manner. It &s;erved only as a convoy to our land troops, but could be of little or no u&s;e to them after they were &s;et on &s;hore; while the dif|ficulties of the coa&s;t, and the uncertainties of wind and weather, rendered it extremely hazard|ous for our &s;hips to continue in any one &s;tation &s;o as that they could be ready to re-admit the land troops after they had executed their commi&s;&s;ion; and&punc; in fact, the frequent debarkations and re|embarkations which the &s;ervice propo&s;ed required, proved it by experience to be inconvenient almo&s;t to impracticability. The third principle was better founded, though not without its excep|tions.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure of making a de&s;cent upon France being re&s;olved upon, the Duke of Marlborough was appointed to command the land troops. He was the grand&s;on of the Great Duke of Marlborough, and from him inherited a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for military glory, e&s;pecially again&s;t the French. In other re&s;pects he was in private life a nobleman of the mo&s;t amiable character, and had di&s;covered upon &s;everal occa&s;ions that he had &s;tudied the art of war, and that his abilities were equal to &s;uch a command; &s;o that no officer in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice was more proper either in point of popularity, or that of &s;ufficiency, to conduct &s;uch an expedition. The land forces under him con&s;i&s;ted of 16 battalions and 9 troops of light hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="49">
To give the greater eclat to this expedition, a mo&s;t formidable naval armament was fitted out. We wi&s;h we could &s;ay that this equipment had been as judicious as we pre&s;ume it was well in|tended. On the 1&s;t of June, Admiral An&s;on, with the fleet under his command, &s;ailed from St. Helens, as did Commodore Howe with his &s;quadron, and all the tran&s;ports about two hours after. The Admiral directed his cour&s;e down the Channel, and the Commodore his for the coa&s;t of France: the &s;hips under the Admiral were the Royal George, 100 guns; Duke, 90; Nep|tune, 90; Ramillies, 90; Barfleur, 90; Union, 80; Newark, 80; Magnanime, 74; Norfolk, 74; Alcide, 74; Chiche&s;ter, 74; Duc d'Aquitaine, 64; Fougueux, 64; Achilles, 60; Intrepide, 60; Norwich, 50; Dunkirk, 60; Southampton, 36; Acteon, 36; Tartar, 20; Leo&s;toft, 20; and Coventry, 36. There were on board the fleet 16 regiments, nine troops of light hor&s;e, and above 2000 marines.</P>
<P>The &s;hips under Commodore Howe were the E&s;&s;ex, 70 guns; Roche&s;ter, 50; Deptford, 50; Portland, 50; Pallas, 36; Brilliant, 36; Rich|mond, 36; Active, 36; Maid&s;tone, 20; Flam|borough, 20; Ro&s;e, 20; Diligence, 16; Suc|ce&s;s, 16; Salta&s;h, 16; Swallow, 16; Speedwell, 16; Pluto fire&s;hip, 16; Salamandar ditto, 16; Infernal bomb, 16; Granada ditto, 16; Cor|morant, 14; 10 Cutters, each 10 guns; 100 tran&s;ports, 20 tenders, and 2 &s;tore&s;hips.</P>
<P>When this fleet &s;ailed, the public imagined that the whole was to bur&s;t upon the coa&s;t of France, but they were &s;oon undeceived. The pow|erful &s;quadron under the Lord An&s;on &s;oon parted from that under Commodore Howe, but left, under the command of the latter, all the tran&s;|ports with the land troops, and his Lord&s;hip
<PB N="47" REF="50">
proceeded for the bay of Bi&s;cay, in order, as was &s;aid, to alarm the coa&s;ts of France, and to ob|&s;erve the French &s;quadron in Bre&s;t. Whether either of tho&s;e two purpo&s;es were objects worthy &s;o prodigious an armament, we &s;hall not pre|&s;ume to determine, becau&s;e we are not fully in|formed as to the effects it produced, or whether they were an&s;werable to the high &s;tation of the Commander, and the prodigious expence of the equipment.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;er &s;quadron, under Commodore Howe, proceeded with the tran&s;ports to the coa&s;t of France, and without any material accident, arrived at Cancalle bay, on the coa&s;t of Britanny, on the 5th of June, about 7 miles di&s;tant from St. Malo; which whether it was the original, or the accidental object of the expedition, we &s;hall not determine; but they re&s;olved to attack it, if prac|ticable. After the troops were landed, the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline was ob&s;erved, and though the inha|bitants of Cancalle had fled in their fir&s;t con&s;ter|nation; yet all exce&s;&s;es committed upon their effects by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiery were puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t rigour. This humane regularity of di&s;cipline had excellent con&s;equences. The in|habitants of the country returned to their habi|tations, and treated our troops not as their in|vaders but their friends. After fortifying a po&s;t near Cancalle, the army under the Duke of Marlborough, &s;et out towards St. Malo, where they &s;oon found, what &s;ome may think they ought to have known long before, that the place was una&s;&s;ailable by the force they had with them, being &s;ituated at the extremity of a long narrow cau&s;eway. His Grace, however, did all that was po&s;&s;ible to be done with the force he had. On the 12th of June, he burnt one man of war of 50 guns, one of 36 (and, to u&s;e the words of the
<PB N="48" REF="51">
Gazette, the be&s;t authority we can follow) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">All the privateers, &s;ome of 30, &s;everal of 20 and 18 guns, and, in the whole, upwards of 100 &s;hips, notwith&s;tanding they were under the cannon of St. Malo; but finding it im|practicable to attack that place, and receiving intelligence of troops being on their march from all &s;ides, his Grace thought it nece&s;&s;ary to march back to Cancalle: Commodore Howe had made &s;o good a di&s;po&s;ition of the boats and tran&s;ports, that four brigades, and ten companies of grenadiers were embarked in le&s;s than &s;even hours, the enemy not hav|ing attempted to attack them; and on the 12th all the troops were on board, waiting to take advantage of the fir&s;t wind, to pur&s;ue the farther objects of his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions.</Q> It is extremely remarkable that during the exe|cution of an enterprize, which did &s;uch infinite damage to the French, the detachment employ|ed in it met with no oppo&s;ition, not even from a &s;ingle &s;hot of the enemy, and they returned equally unmole&s;ted to Cancalle.</P>
<P>The re-embarkation being made, the Duke of Marlborough and the officers under him proceed|ed to the coa&s;ts of Normandy, where they re|connoitred the town of Granville, which they did not think fit to attempt, becau&s;e a large body of French troops lay encamped in its neighbour|hood. They then moved towards Cherbourg; but the weather proving unfavourable, the fleet running &s;hort in provi&s;ions, and the crews &s;ickly, all further attempts were judged impracticable, and the fleet arrived, on the 29th of June, at St. Helens; and the Duke of Marlborough was appointed to take the command in chief of the Briti&s;h troops &s;erving in, or de&s;tined for Ger|many.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
Had it not been for the prodigious force of the Briti&s;h fleet on its fir&s;t &s;ailing for this expe|dition, it is more than probable that the public would have been much better &s;atisfied with the event of it. The damage done to France, how|ever, was very con&s;iderable, and the people were plea&s;ed with the reflection that we in reality had &s;ubjected her to the ho&s;tilities with which &s;he had only menaced us. If no exce&s;&s;ive joy was expre&s;&s;ed, no murmuring was heard in public; and the &s;pirit of the nation was kept up by the declarations of the mini&s;try, that the remaining part of the &s;ea&s;on would be employed in action. In le&s;s than a month after the return of the ar|mament under the Duke of Marlborough, an|other, but not of equal &s;trength, was fitted out.</P>
<P>General Bligh was appointed to command the new armament, as was before mentioned; he had &s;erved with great reputation in the late war, and it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to prove the mini&s;ter to be in earne&s;t, notwith&s;tanding, the &s;mallne&s;s of the land force, which was not 6000 men com|plete, that the &s;econd Prince of the blood, Prince Edward, &s;ince Duke of York, &s;hould &s;erve on board the fleet. Like the great Czar of Mu&s;covy, he re&s;olved to go through all the &s;ubordinate du|ties before he arrived at the higher commands. Commodore Howe had the command of the fleet, and General Bligh of the land forces, the Duke of Marlborough having by this time been nomi|nated to the command of the Briti&s;h troops who were ordered for Germany.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t before the fleet &s;ailed from St. Helens, and on the 6th it appeared off Cherburg. This is a &s;ea-port in the very middle of the channel, and therefore commodiou&s;ly &s;i|tuated for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h navigation by
<PB N="50" REF="53">
privateering, and even for facilitating an inva&s;ion. The place is naturally weak, but the convenien|cy of its &s;ituation for the above purpo&s;es had in|duced the French court to lavi&s;h mo&s;t immen&s;e &s;ums in &s;upplying the defects of nature by enlarge|ing and deepening the harbour, rai&s;ing fortifica|tions, making Sluices, building a mole, opening flood-gates, and forming a ba&s;on, &s;o that the whole was ju&s;tly deemed a &s;tupendous undertak|ing, and worthy the genius of Mon&s;ieur Belidor, the famous engineer who had projected it. Hap|pily, perhaps for us, either the wi&s;dom or the par&s;imony of Cardinal Fleury did not keep pace with the va&s;tne&s;s of the de&s;ign, but enough was fini&s;hed to give every Briton an idea that another Dunkirk, more dangerous than that which had been demoli&s;hed, would ari&s;e in Cherburg, that it would prove to England what Carthage was to Rome, and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to ruin it.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h fleet coming to anchor before this important place, it &s;oon appeared that the French had more than &s;u&s;pected its de&s;tination. They had &s;trengthened the landing places with forts, and a large body of militia, while three regiments of regulars lined the &s;hore, &s;o that a re&s;olute oppo&s;ition was expected. Intrepidity is often the cheape&s;t way of making war, and that of the Briti&s;h Commodore upon this occa&s;ion &s;aved blood. His di&s;po&s;itions were &s;o ju&s;t, and yet &s;o bold, that the troops landed almo&s;t without lo&s;s under the fire of the &s;hips, and the amazement of the French at their courage &s;eemed to take from them the powers of re&s;i&s;tance, though fa|voured by all that art could contribute to render it effectual. They abandoned fort after fort, and one port after another, &s;o that the Briti&s;h troops may be &s;aid to have walked ra|ther
<PB N="51" REF="54">
than to have marched into Cherburg, the day after their landing. The de&s;ign of the ex|pedition was &s;oon an&s;wered; a few hours quickly laid in ruins the labours of half an age, and the product of 40 millions of livres. A mo&s;t &s;u|perb train of bra&s;s artillery fell into the hands of the conquerors, who behaved with &s;o much hu|manity and good manners to the de&s;encele&s;s in|habitants, that when the &s;hips in the harbour were burnt, and the work of demolition was over, they appeared to be vi&s;itors rather than in|vaders.</P>
<P>Were not the fact recent and unque&s;tionably atte&s;ted, it would appear highly improbable, that 6000 Briti&s;h troops &s;hould remain unmole&s;ted for ten days in France, which proudly, perhaps ju&s;tly, boa&s;ts her&s;elf to be the greate&s;t land pow|er in Europe; that they &s;hould without oppo&s;iti|on take ho&s;tages for payment of contributions, and reimbark, as commodiou&s;ly and &s;afely, as if they had been in their own country. The ar|tillery was &s;ent to England, and September 16th drawn in triumph from Ken&s;ington to the tower of London with a pompous attendance of guards, hor&s;e and foot, and every circum&s;tance that could &s;erve to awaken in the minds of the people the ideas they had formed of the military glories of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>After the reimbarkation was completed, the fleet was driven towards the coa&s;ts of England, but &s;oon after made for the bay of St. Lunar, where the land troops made a &s;econd de&s;cent near the town of St. Malo. The mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction that can be put upon this attempt is, that it was po&s;&s;ible the French in St. Malo might have been off their guard, or like tho&s;e of Cherburg, intimidated from making re&s;i&s;tance. This &s;uppo&s;ition proved groundle&s;s, and after
<PB N="52" REF="55">
the troops were landed, their commanders could not figure in their own minds a practicable object of attack, while the rockine&s;s of the bay ren|dered it &s;o dangerous for the Commodore to con|tinue there with his &s;hipping, that he was obliged to move three leagues we&s;tward to the bay of St. Cas. This &s;eparation of the fleet from the army, and the operations of the latter, which were vi&s;ibly undetermined and u&s;ele&s;s, gave &s;pi|rit to the French. The Duke d'Aguillon, go|vernor of Brittany, who in point of reputation was then at the head of the &s;econd rate French Generals, and perhaps now de&s;erves to be rank|ed among&s;t the fir&s;t, got together 12 battalions, 6 &s;quadrons of regular troops, and two regiments of militia, which are little inferior to regulars, and advancing within &s;ix miles of the Engli&s;h army, was now arrived at the village of Matig|non, after repelling all the flying attacks made upon them by the enemy. The inequality of the force, and the di&s;advantages of &s;ituation &s;oon determined the Briti&s;h commanders to make the be&s;t of their way to St. Cas, which lay at the di&s;tance only of three miles. The march of tho&s;e three miles however contained in it cir|cum&s;tances and incidents more puzzling and un|accountable than that of Hannibal over the Alps, and we are better acquainted with the particulars of the latter than of the former. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that, to the eternal di&s;grace of the French, every man of the Engli&s;h was not de&s;troyed or taken. The French were &s;o cautious in their approaches, that the Engli&s;h proceeded unmo|le&s;ted in their march, though it was &s;o inter&s;ected by incidents and their ignorance of the country, that it was in the power of the Duke d'Aguillon entirely to have cut off their communication with their fleet, an advantage which a Briti&s;h
<PB N="53" REF="56">
officer would have e&s;teemed to be his highe&s;t good fortune had the French been under the like circum&s;tances in England. The Duke, however, more prudently perhaps, permitted all the Engli&s;h but their rear, which was mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of the foot guards and grenadiers, to embark, and then he marched down from the heights that en|vironed the bay to attack the Engli&s;h. The re|&s;i&s;tance of the latter did honour to their country, but be&s;ides the di&s;advantages of numbers, the French being above twelve to one, they were under the irreparable one of falling &s;hort of am|munition. The bravery of their fellow &s;ubjects contributed to their misfortune. Commodore Howe &s;eeing their danger, ordered him&s;elf to be rowed in his own &s;hallop, attended by the boats of the fleet, as near the &s;hore as po&s;&s;ible to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in bringing off his countrymen. By this time the &s;mall handful of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had been entirely broken by the va&s;t &s;uperiority of the French, who refu&s;ed them quarter while the fire continued from the fleet. That cea&s;ing, about 600 were made pri&s;oners, and it appeared that about 400 had been killed, among&s;t whom was Sir John Armitage, a young gentleman of large fortune in York&s;hire, and a volunteer in the &s;ervice. General Drury was likewi&s;e among&s;t the dead, being drowned by endeavouring to e&s;cape to a boat. But we are now to attend a more important and a more fortunate expedition in another quarter of the world.</P>
<P>The year 1757 was far from being favourable to the Briti&s;h arms either by land or &s;ea. In A|merica, where the Earl of Loudohn commanded in chief, an expedition had been planned again&s;t Crown Point; but it was dropt, and it was re&s;olved to attack Loui&s;bourg. Admiral Hol|bourn was appointed to command the fleet,
<PB N="54" REF="57">
which was &s;trong and well provided, and &s;ailed from Corke with 6000 land troops on the 7th of May. We &s;hall omit the ill-natured re|flections which were given out, as if an oppor|tunity had been lo&s;t, during the voyage, of fight|ing the French fleet. It is certain that the Admiral landed at Hallifax the beginning of July, where he was met by the Earl, at the head of 6000 men, brought with him from New-York. When this formidable armament was preparing to proceed to the place of its de&s;tination, a kind of a panic &s;eized the land forces, upon an intelli|gence that was pretended to have been received, that 17 French &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, with all kind of ammunition and military &s;tores, were arrived in the harbour of Loui&s;bourg. One Engli&s;h officer, Lord Charles Hay, was for proceeding; but he was put under arre&s;t, not without &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of his being a madman, and afterwards tried for his life, on an accu&s;ation of mutiny. He was almo&s;t &s;ingle in his opinion, and the council of war (tho' it does not appear that any enquiry into the report was made) agreed in opinion for laying a&s;ide the expedition by land for that &s;ea&s;on. As to our fleet, they &s;ailed, as was &s;aid, to block up Loui&s;bourg harbour, and to provoke that of France to an engagement. The Admiral was di&s;appointed in both. The French, who&s;e force was greatly inferior to his, were too wi&s;e to attack him, and on the 25th of Sept. &s;uch a &s;torm aro&s;e as drove the Admiral from before the harbour, and obliged him to return to England, in a mo&s;t &s;hattered condition, after lo&s;ing one &s;hip, and having eleven di&s;ma&s;ted.</P>
<P>Di&s;grace &s;ucceeded di&s;appointment, and our proceedings in America during the remainder of this year formed a &s;eries of melancholy mi&s;carri|ages. The French, who had taken O&s;wego,
<PB N="55" REF="58">
were ma&s;ters of the Lakes, and we abandoned to their mercy both the friend&s;hip and the protection of the five Indian Nations. So that at la&s;t, fall|ing from one blunder into another, our forts were demoli&s;hed, our communication with the Indians, our allies, was cut off, our frontiers invaded by the French, and their Savages, who de&s;troyed all our fine &s;ettlements on the Mohawks river, and the German flats; and at la&s;t the &s;iege of Fort William Henry, built on the Southern edge of Lake George, was formed, a place of the utmo&s;t importance for covering that frontier.</P>
<P>The reflections ari&s;ing from &s;o many ruinous di&s;graceful events were the more mortifying, when it was con&s;idered that America had never &s;een in one body &s;o great a Briti&s;h force as it did that year; a force which was thought &s;uf|ficient to have driven the French out of that continent. There was a garri&s;on of 2500 men within Fort William Henry, and General Webb lay near it with 4000 more. Mon&s;. Montcalm, the French General, had not in the whole above 8000 men, including the Canadians and Indians. In war incredulity and credulity have often the &s;ame fatal effects. Montcalm's intentions, and preparations, tho' &s;ufficiently public, were di&s;be|lieved. No care was taken to bring the militia together, which had it been done, would have rendered the Engli&s;h far &s;uperior to their enemies. Montcalm was encouraged to proceed in the &s;iege by the &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance he met with, and on the 9th of Augu&s;t, which was &s;ix days after the &s;iege was formed, the place was &s;urrendered; the garri&s;on engaging not to &s;erve again&s;t the French for eighteen months; but obtained the favour of marching out with their arms and baggage. The French Savages, paid &s;o little regard to the terms of the capitulation, that they
<PB N="56" REF="59">
plundered the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers as they marched out, and &s;calped the Indians and Blacks, that had been in the garri&s;on, and practi&s;ed a thou&s;and other inhumanities, from which the French Generals pretended to re&s;train them, but to no purpo&s;e. It was however &s;trongly &s;urmi&s;ed in England that the Savages were privately in&s;tructed to act as they did; becau&s;e, had the French General encouraged the Engli&s;h to &s;tand to their defence, and made di&s;po&s;itions of his own men for &s;upporting them, as the laws of war required him to do, the Savages dur&s;t not have ventured to be &s;o outrageous.</P>
<P>After demoli&s;hing the fort, and carrying off all they found in it, the French put an end to the campaign, and the world &s;aw with amaze|ment 2000 regular troops, be&s;ides a great number of Provincials, and a va&s;t naval force of 20 &s;hips, provided with every thing that could render war glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful, loiter away a whole year, at the expence of twelve millions to their mother country, in doing wor&s;e than nothing, again&s;t an enemy, who&s;e only &s;trength lay in the avarice of tho&s;e, who&s;e unprecedented appointments had rendered it their intere&s;t to protract the war.</P>
<P>The indignation conceived by the people of England at this inglorious campaign in America rou&s;ed the national &s;pirit. The new mini&s;try, and the old, concurred equally in cheri&s;hing it; and it was re&s;olved to change hands, and to em|ploy other commanders, both by land and &s;ea, in making a new attempt upon Loui&s;bourg.</P>
<P>On the 19th of February Admiral Bo&s;cawen &s;ailed with a powerful fleet of &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports from England to Halifax; from whence he &s;ailed with 157 &s;hips, great and &s;mall, and about 14,000 land troops, under the command of
<PB N="57" REF="60">
General Amher&s;t, and on the 2d of June appear|ed before Loui&s;bourg. The French in America on this occa&s;ion behaved better than their coun|trymen in France did in the de&s;cent upon Cher|bourg. They rai&s;ed batteries all along the coa&s;t where a landing was practicable, and the &s;urf was &s;o great that for &s;ix days no boat could approach the &s;hore. At la&s;t the &s;urf &s;ub&s;iding, di&s;po&s;itions were made for landing in three divi&s;ions; the left, where the hotte&s;t &s;ervice was expected, being under the command of General Wolfe. The frigates of the fleet were po&s;ted to the right and left, to rake the enemy on their flanks. General Wolf's divi&s;ion moved in boats towards the land, and nothing but the greate&s;t intrepidity of that brave commander and his &s;oldiers could have rendered the landing effectual. The enemy re&s;erved their &s;irc till the Briti&s;h troops were near the &s;hore, and then gave it with full effect both from their cannon and mu&s;quetry; but neither the &s;laughter of men, the over&s;eting and wreck|ing of boats, nor the advantageous po&s;ition of the enemy, could daunt the a&s;&s;ailants. Each encouraged his neighbour. They who could not jump waded a&s;hore, and at la&s;t the whole fell upon the enemy and drove them from their po&s;ts; upon which the other two divi&s;ions made good their landing with far le&s;s lo&s;s than could have been expected.</P>
<P>The &s;urf on the &s;hore returning, rendered it difficult to land the artillery and the implements nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;iege; and the French had in the harbour of Loui&s;bourg five men of war that could bring their artillery to bear upon the approaches of the Briti&s;h troops. Per&s;everance, intrepedity, and judgment, &s;urmounted all tho&s;e difficulties. General Wolfe on the 12th of June took from the enemy a po&s;t, called the light-battery,
<PB N="58" REF="61">
by which he could annoy the enemy's &s;hips, and the batteries on the other &s;ide of the harbour. And on the 25th he &s;ilenced what was called the i&s;land battery, which bore the harde&s;t upon him. Notwith&s;tanding this, t e enemy continued to make a brave re&s;i&s;tance; but on the 21&s;t of July one of the French &s;hips of war blew up, and the explo&s;ion being commu|nicated to other two, all the three were de&s;troyed. This lo&s;s &s;eemed to damp the garri&s;on, and the Admiral now thought it practicable to de&s;troy the two remaining &s;hips in the harbour. For that purpo&s;e a detachment of about 600 &s;eamen were &s;ent in boats, under the command of Captains Laforey and Balfour, who executed their in&s;truc|tions with amazing intrepidity and &s;ucce&s;s. They towed one of the &s;hips out of the harbour, and burnt the other, which ran aground. Upon this a council of war was held within the place, and it was determined to treat about a capitulation. Drucour, the Governor, at fir&s;t demanded the terms that had been granted to the garri&s;on of Fort St. Philip in Minorca, but the Briti&s;h Ad|miral and General in a joint letter informed him, that the Engli&s;h were about to enter the harbour, and batter the town, in which ca&s;e he mu&s;t &s;tand to all the bloody con&s;equences, if he and his gar|ri&s;on did not immediately &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; which they accordingly did.</P>
<P>The taking of Loui&s;bourg, though attended with &s;ome lo&s;s, was a greater proof of the debi|lity of the French Government than of the cow|ardice or the mi&s;management of their troops. It is true the garri&s;on, which &s;urrendered the 26th of July, amounted to 5637 troops, and they were provided with 221 pieces of cannon, 18 mortars, and a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;tores and ammunition; &s;o that it ought to have made
<PB N="59" REF="62">
a better defence than it did. But on the other hand, the fortifications of the place, con&s;idering its va&s;t importance to the French, had not been &s;ufficiently attended to; and in any event had the &s;iege continued, famine mu&s;t have obliged it to &s;urrender. Add to this, that the French court failed in all its promi&s;es to Drucour of &s;ending him a force from Canada &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the &s;iege. The &s;urrender of Loui&s;bourg brought on that of the i&s;land of St. John, and of all the French &s;tations for carrying on their fi&s;hery to|wards Ga&s;pe&s;ie and the bay de Chaleurs.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h nation had, for years before this important event happened, been &s;o accu&s;tomed to mi&s;carriages in America, that they could &s;carcely credit their good fortune when the news of the &s;urrender of Loui&s;bourg arrived. The acqui&s;iti|on of the place was not of greater &s;ervice than the &s;pirit it rai&s;ed in the nation; and both we and our confederates were now convinced, that the high ideas we had entertained of the French power had been the chief means of their &s;ucce&s;s. We had &s;een them in&s;ulted in their mother coun|try, and deprived of the &s;tronge&s;t, as well as the mo&s;t convenient place they held in America; for Loui&s;bourg was the place of rendezvous for all their ve&s;&s;els employed in the cod fi&s;hery, and all the troops they &s;ent to Canada. The views of the Briti&s;h government now enlarged, and it was judged expedient, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to drive the French from Ticonderoga, deemed their mo&s;t im|pregnable pa&s;s on the continent of America, and Crown-Point, which Ticonderoga covered. Ge|neral Abercrombie, who had &s;ucceeded Lord Lo dohn as Commander in chief of the Briti&s;h forces in America, undertook this expedition. On the 5th of July, he embarked upon Lake George, with almo&s;t 16,000 troops, regulars and
<PB N="60" REF="63">
provincials, and a numerous well provided artil|lery; and next day he effected his landing with|out oppo&s;ition; the advanced guard of the French retiring before them. No man, who has not been in per&s;on in America, can have a ju&s;t idea of the face of the country, which lies between the place of landing and Tigonderoga, and which had, perhaps, never been trod by humane feet, if we except the &s;avage, thinly &s;cattered, natives. The Briti&s;h troops had no direction for their march but the quarters of the heavens; and even the&s;e were intercepted by the trees of the woods through which they were obliged to pa&s;s. It was therefore no wonder if the officers and &s;oldiers, many of whom, perhaps, were not ex|pert a&s;tronomers, lo&s;t their way in this more than bewildering march. The French advanced guard did the &s;ame, and a rencounter en&s;ued, in which about 300 French were killed, and 148 taken pri&s;oners. But this rencounter, though the Eng|li&s;h were victorious, co&s;t them dear, for in it was lo&s;t the gallant Lord Howe, who&s;e name in|terrupts the narrative of hi&s;tory to commemorate his virtues. He was the Scipio of his age and country; formed for all that was amiable in &s;o|ciety, and great in war; while he i&s;&s;ued the or|der, he &s;et the example; and by his behaviour towards his &s;uperiors, he taught his inferiors their duty towards him. But tho&s;e are qualifications that enter into the character of every complete officer. Lord Howe, to great merit as an officer, joined great genius as a &s;oldier. He had the &s;pi|rit to adapt him&s;elf to the &s;ervice he was engaged in, di&s;couraging and difficult as it was, by re|trenching in his own per&s;on every incumberance that could ari&s;e from his rank, either as a noble|man or an officer, even to the cutting off his hair. The common &s;oldier &s;aw him fare like
<PB N="61" REF="64">
him&s;elf, nor did he &s;eem to affect the lea&s;t pre|eminence but in his forwardne&s;s to encounter dan|ger and endure fatigue; &s;o that he appeared to be rather imitated than obeyed by all under his command.</P>
<P>On the 28th of July the Briti&s;h army, which had marched in four columns, appeared before Ticonderoga, which is &s;ituated on an i&s;thmus between Lake George and a gut which commu|nicates with Lake Champlain. The French, who had been apprized of the expedition, had omitted nothing to render the pa&s;s impregnable. It was acce&s;&s;ible only in the front, where a large mora&s;s was to be pa&s;&s;ed, the vacuities of which were &s;upplied by a fortification eight or ten feet high, well furni&s;hed with cannon, and lined by above 5000 men. The ground, as u&s;ual, was reconnoitred by General Abercrombie's order, and the engineer reported, that he thought the intrenchments were practicable by &s;mall artil|lery. This fatal report produced an order for an attack, without waiting for the great artil|lery, which was &s;low in coming up; lea&s;t the French &s;hould be joined by 3000 troops, who were &s;aid to be on their march to Ticonderoga. The attack was made with that vigour and in|trepidity which is peculiar to the Briti&s;h troops, and they performed every thing but impo&s;&s;ibili|ties. The pa&s;s was not only fortified, as has al|ready been de&s;cribed, but &s;hut up with va&s;t trees felled down with their leaves towards the a&s;&s;ail|ants, &s;o as both to conceal and favour the French. The carnage was horrible, and the General be|ing convinced that the attempt was impractica|ble, ordered a retreat, after lo&s;ing about 2000 men killed, wounded, or taking pri&s;oners in the action, which la&s;ted about four hours. That this attack was unfortunate cannot be denied;
<PB N="62" REF="65">
and it was the more &s;o, becau&s;e the lo&s;s fell upon the brave&s;t of our troops, who had not the &s;atis|faction of dearly &s;elling their lives; &s;o inacce&s;|&s;ible were their enemies in their entrenchments. There was plainly a defect of judgement, but the public is not yet agreed where the blame ought to lie. According to the General's account he was mi&s;informed by the engineer. Be that as it will, the retreat &s;eems to be the wi&s;e&s;t part of the expedition as well as the &s;peedie&s;t; for the even|ing after the action, the Briti&s;h army regained their camp to the Southward of Lake George.</P>
<P>The unfortunate attack upon Ticonderoga did not prevent our operations in America, during the year 1758, from being in the main &s;ucce&s;sful. To make the be&s;t of our mi&s;carriage, Colonel Brad&s;treet was &s;ent with 3000 provincials again&s;t Fort Frontenac, the garri&s;on of which was under|&s;tood to be weak. The great difficulty of this expedition lay in the length of the way which the army had to &s;urmount before they could come at their object. At la&s;t, with a&s;toni&s;hing per&s;e|verance, it arrived at O&s;wego, embarked on Lake Ontario, and the 25th of Augu&s;t came before Fort Frontenac, which &s;tands near the communication between that Lake and the river St. Lawrence. It could not be expected, that a place garri&s;oned as that was, only by 150 men, could make any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance. The Colonel, two days after he came before it, took it without the lo&s;s of a man, and de&s;troyed within it a large magazine of provi&s;ions that was to have &s;upplied their Southern forts. Nine armed &s;loops were likewi&s;e taken and burnt, and the fort was de&s;troyed, becau&s;e as matters were then circum&s;tanced, it would have been &s;acrifi|cing men to have left a garri&s;on within a place, where a communication with our other &s;ettle|ments
<PB N="63" REF="66">
was extremely difficult, if not impractica|ble. The execution of an expedition again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne, a po&s;t of va&s;t importance for commanding the Ohio, and for breaking the chief link of that chain of forts which the French had erected for effecting a communication be|tween Canada and Loui&s;iana was committed to General Forbes, an officer of experience, bred up under General Campbel, who lo&s;t his life at Fontenoy, and pre&s;ent at mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable actions in Europe during the la&s;t war. He marched from Penn&s;ylvania with a con&s;iderable army, through countries which no Europeans had ever before pa&s;&s;ed; and infe&s;ted on every &s;ide by the enemy's Indians. Major Grant with a body of Highlanders and Provincials, as being mo&s;t proper for that &s;ervice, had the command of the advanced guard, which con&s;i&s;ted of about 800 men; but advancing too near the fort, in hopes po&s;&s;ibly of &s;urprizing it, he was defeated by the garri&s;on with &s;ome lo&s;s. The main body of our army coming up, the garri&s;on which con&s;i&s;ted of between 4 and 500 men, after damaging their works fell down the Ohio, and left the General at liberty to enter the place; which he repaired, and it now goes by the name of Pit&s;burgh, &s;o called from the gentleman who was looked upon to be the &s;oul of all our pro&s;perous undertak|ings.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h arms in America this year, though not &s;triking, were &s;olid, be|cau&s;e they directly regarded the primary object of the war on our part, which was the &s;ecurity of our back &s;ettlements, and con&s;equently of all our intere&s;t in North America, which was not only effectually done, but the enemy by the lo&s;s of Loui&s;bourg, the American Dunkirk, was de|prived of that re&s;ervoir which &s;upplied the chan|nels
<PB N="64" REF="67">
of war thro' all their other &s;ettlements. It is po&s;&s;ible, that had they not been &s;o infatuated, as to imagine they could retrieve in Germany all that they had lo&s;t in America, the Briti&s;h court in the beginning of the year 1759 might have li&s;tened to terms of accommodation. But no|thing could convince the French, that by mul|tiplying the dangers of Hanover and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, they could not force our court to a peace on their other terms; and this brings me back to the affairs on the continent of Europe.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of June, Prince Ferdinand, who could not prevent the French from pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine, pur&s;ued them acro&s;s that river, which he pa&s;|&s;ed at Herven and Rees, in &s;ight of all their ar|my, which was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed at the boldne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age, that they retired towards Meurs, while it was plain by the motions of the Prince that he de&s;igned to pa&s;s the Mae&s;e, and there|by oblige the Prince de Soubi&s;e to abandon an enterprize he was meditating again&s;t He&s;&s;e Ca&s;|&s;el. To prevent his executing this &s;cheme, the French at la&s;t made a &s;tand at Crevelt, with their right towards the village of Vi&s;chelon, and their left towards Anrath; Crevelt lying in the front of their right. In &s;hort, their &s;ituation was &s;trong, their di&s;po&s;itions judicious, and it required great exertion of military genius to attack them with any appearance of &s;ucce&s;s. A wood covered their left wing at Anrath, and the Prince after accu|rately reconnoitring all their vi&s;ible po&s;ts, and in|forming him&s;elf of the nature of the ground, judged an attack on the flank of their right wing was the mo&s;t practicable, but that it mu&s;t be fa|voured by two other attacks, which, though real, were in a great mea&s;ure to be continued or di&s;continued according to the &s;ucce&s;s of the main one, and which was to be commanded by him&s;elf.
<PB N="65" REF="68">
He accordingly advanced at the head of the gre|nadiers again&s;t the enemies le&s;t wing, which &s;uf|fered from the &s;uperior fire of the Hanoverian ar|tillery; but the French, favoured by the wood, &s;till maintained their po&s;ts, which made it nece&s;|&s;ary to di&s;oodge them by a clo&s;er engagement. This was begun by the gallant Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, at the head of the fir&s;t line of foot, with which he formed a front again&s;t the wood, and the fire of the mu&s;quetry here continued ince&s;&s;antly for two hours and an half. The Hanoverian infantry at la&s;t penetrated into the wood, where they found two ditches lined with troops, which were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively forced. This intrepidity threw the French into a di&s;order which was a prelude to the defeat of that wing; but a defeat which in its con&s;equences was no way corre&s;pondent to the courage and conduct of the conquerors. The French cavalry were not to be broken by the utmo&s;t efforts of the Hanove|rian hor&s;e, and notwith&s;tanding a mo&s;t dread|ful fire, maintained them&s;elves in good order upon the plain, and covered the remains of their infantry of the left wing as they were driven out of the wood. The two other attacks went no further than cannonading, but though the enemy &s;uffered by it, their wing and center retired in good order to Nuis. We are apt to believe that the lo&s;s on both &s;ides was carefully concealed. That of the French in killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, was about 7000, according to the be&s;t accounts, and the lo&s;s of the Hanoverians exceeded 3000; but it is difficult to a&s;certain the lo&s;s of an army that is victorious and keeps the field of bat|tle. In this engagement was killed the Count de Gi&s;ors, the only &s;on of the Mar&s;hal Duke de Bellei&s;le, a young nobleman who at the time of his death was not above 25 years of age, but
<PB N="66" REF="69">
&s;o amiable in his manners, and &s;o accompli&s;hed in his per&s;on, that in him &s;eem to have expired the lingering remains of French urbanity and virtue. Books, travelling, conver&s;ation and &s;tudy, had given him every kind of knowledge but that of war, which he re&s;olved to acquire by experience; but he fell at the head of his re|giment in his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>Though all concurred in doing ju&s;tice to the military merits of Prince Ferdinand, and the courage of his troops, yet &s;ome wi&s;hed they had been employed on an occa&s;ion in which &s;ucce&s;s might have been attended by deci&s;ion. The French, notwith&s;tanding, their repul&s;e at Cre|velt, were in the neighbourhood of their own country, from whence they drew &s;uch re&s;ources that not only made them &s;tronger than ever in the field, but enabled them to reinforce the Prince de Soubi&s;e. Prince Ferdinand, con&s;cious of his inferiority, &s;ought to avail him&s;elf of his victory. He pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and on the 28th of June he appeared before the important city of Du&s;&s;eldorp, &s;ituated on that river, belonging to the elector Palatine, and the capital of the Dutchy of Berg. It was garri&s;oned by 2000 French; but after a bri&s;k bombardment it &s;ur|rendered to the Prince on the 7th of July, and the garri&s;on was &s;uffered to depart with the ho|nours of war. By the taking of Du&s;&s;eldorp, Prince Ferdinand was enabled to &s;ecure his re|treat over the Rhine, which it was too apparent he mu&s;t &s;oon be forced to make. After leaving three battalions of Hanoverians to garri&s;on Du&s;|&s;eldorp, he &s;pent &s;everal days in facing the French army, and watching his advantages. But both parties had their rea&s;ons for declining a &s;e|cond engagement. Prince Ferdinand flattered him&s;elf that the He&s;&s;ian General, the Prince of
<PB N="67" REF="70">
Y&s;enburg, would cut out work for the Prince de Soubi&s;e, till he could carry the war into the enemies country by pa&s;&s;ing the Mae&s;e, the ef|fects of which probably mu&s;t have been, that the Prince would have fallen back upon the main body of the French army, which was now com|manded by the Mar&s;hal de Contades. The hopes of his Serene Highne&s;s &s;oon vani&s;hed; for on the 23d of July, the Duke de Broglio defeated the He&s;&s;ian army of 7000 men near Sanger&s;hau|&s;en; by which they came to the command of the river, and ma&s;ters of all that part of We&s;tpha|lia.</P>
<P>By this time the Engli&s;h mini&s;try were con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity they were under to &s;up|port the German war with Briti&s;h troops as well as Briti&s;h money. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia could &s;pare no troops to Prince Ferdinand; none were to be expected from the few Princes of the em|pire, who had the courage to appear openly for the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t; his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty's de|clared intention was to remain neutral; Hanover and He&s;&s;e could bring no more to the field than they had done; the Dutch had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to join us; and to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Swi&s;s, or any other power, was impracticable; and at the &s;ame time it was thought that 12 or 14,000 men, e&s;pecially Briti&s;h troops, would turn the &s;cale of war in our favour. Our mini|&s;ters had in their eye another con&s;ideration, which was that of diverting the French from interrupt|ing the va&s;t de&s;igns they now meditated in Ame|rica and the Ea&s;t Indies. All tho&s;e con&s;iderati|ons, joined to the di&s;po&s;itions of the public in their favour, encouraged them to agree to &s;end a body of about 10,000 Engli&s;h troops, under the Duke of Marlborough, to Hanover, and they had landed at Embden about the time the unfor|tunate
<PB N="68" REF="71">
battle was fought at Sanger&s;hau&s;en. The reader, however, mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that by this time the new e&s;tabli&s;hment of the militia went on with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;o con&s;iderable an evacuation of regular troops was neither felt nor dreaded by the public. But Prince Ferdinand and our friends in Germany were apprehen&s;ive that the French, after their late advantage in He&s;&s;e, might intercept the army under his Grace before they joined the Allies. Prince Ferdinand would gladly, in &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ituation, have fought the French, but they had taken their mea|&s;ures &s;o well that he could not bring them to a battle. He would have repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, but the roads he was to march through had been rendered almo&s;t impracticable by the rains that had fallen, and the overflowings of the rivers, nor, till the&s;e were abated, could he pa&s;s the bridge at Rees, which was covered by Baron Imhoff with about 3000 foot and four &s;quadrons of ca|valry, in order to &s;ecure the junction of the Bri|ti&s;h troops with tho&s;e of their Allies.</P>
<P>Mons. de Chevert, the mo&s;t active of all the French officers, had been detached from the French army, which was now under no appre|hen&s;ions; but the rains and other accidents pre|vented the execution of Baron Imhoff's de&s;igns as was before mentioned: he therefore &s;trength|ened him&s;elf with draughts from garri&s;ons, which encrea&s;ed his army to about 12,000 men, with a de&s;ign to attack Imhoff. But while the French General thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of his blow, a re|&s;olution, not perhaps wholly uninfluenced by de&s;|pair (for he could obtain no &s;uccours from Prince Ferdinand, becau&s;e the &s;well of the waters &s;till continued) prompted Imhoff to become the ag|gre&s;&s;or. He then lay near Meer, to the right of the Rhine, and on the 5th of Augu&s;t his detach|ment,
<PB N="69" REF="72">
with their bayonets fixed, attacked all the army under Chevert, while they were in difficult grounds and in a critical &s;ituation. An attack &s;o &s;pirited and unexpected, &s;truck the French with a panic, from which all the efforts of their Ge|neral could not recover them. Their re&s;i&s;tance did not continue half an hour; for they took refuge under the cannon of We&s;el, leaving many dead upon the field, with a great number of pri&s;oners, and 11 pieces of cannon, in the hands of the Hanoverians. After this victory, which did Imhoff great honour, he &s;ecured his maga|zines at Meer, and after receiving a few rein|forcements, which pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in boats from Prince Ferdinand's army, he marched to meet the Duke of Marlborough, whom he joined without farther trouble.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand was now to repa&s;s the Rhine, which he did under great difficulties. The Hereditary Prince forced a &s;trong po&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French at Wachtendonck, being the fir&s;t who plunged into the river to attack it, and was followed by his grenadiers, who di&s;lodged the enemy with fixed bayonets. This bold action encrea&s;ed the terror of the French; and tho' the bridge at Rees continued &s;till impa&s;&s;able, he ef|fected his pa&s;&s;age on the 9th and 10th of Augu&s;t at Griethuy&s;ter, a little below that bridge.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, however, the campaign in tho&s;e parts this year was rather bloody than advantageous to either party. Prince Ferdinand had not been able to improve his victory at Crevelt, nor the French theirs at Sanger&s;hau&s;en, the Prince of Y&s;enburg, after his defeat, having retreated to a &s;trong encampment. Reputation was all, in reality, that either &s;ide had lo&s;t or won, and in that re&s;pect, the advantage lay clearly on the &s;ide of Prince Ferdinand and his troops.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73">
The Ru&s;&s;ians had now penetrated into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, where they be&s;ieged Cu&s;trin, and a few days would have led them to the defencele&s;s gates of Berlin. The Swedes had gained ground upon the Pru&s;&s;ian Generals, Wedel and Manteufel, in Pomerania, and the army of the Empire with a body of Au&s;trians under General Haddick, were not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many &s;trong po&s;ts on the frontiers of Mi&s;nia; but began to pinch the quarters of Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, who lay with about 20,000 men at Diepold&s;wald. While matters were in this &s;ituation, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had no choice left, but to clear his own dominions, if po&s;&s;ible, of the Ru&s;&s;ians; while Mar&s;hal Daun, neglecting all other objects, was intent upon recovering Saxony from the Pru&s;&s;ians. But through his natural caution he &s;everal times altered the plan of his operations, &s;ometimes pointing them to|wards pur&s;uing the King of Pru&s;&s;ia into Sile&s;ia, &s;ometimes again&s;t Berlin; but at la&s;t leaving the Generals Harg and de Ville on the &s;outhern frontiers of Sile&s;ia, to amu&s;e the Pru&s;&s;ians he began his march by Zittau, Gorlitz, and Bautzen, to|wards Dre&s;den. By cro&s;&s;ing at Mei&s;&s;en he might have cut off all communication between Dre&s;den and Deip&s;ic, and by attacking Prince Henry, who was now encamped at Seidlitz, he might have put him between two fires, that of his own army, and that of the army of the Empire. But the vigilance of the Prince, who &s;ecured a communication with his brother, and took care to keep Dre&s;den at his back, fru&s;trated for that time all the &s;chemes of that cautious General.</P>
<P>Mean while, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, notwith|&s;tanding all the interruption given him by the Generals Jahnus and Laudohn, marched by Wi&s;oca, Politz and Land&s;hut, and on the 20th
<PB N="71" REF="74">
of Augu&s;t he reached Franckfort on the Oder, where he joined Count Dohna, who lay there with &s;ome troops, but too incon&s;iderable to act again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, who ever &s;ince the 15th had been throwing bombs and red-hot &s;hells into Cu&s;trin; by which the place was &s;et on fire, and the inhabitants reduced to the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate that imagination can form, and to complete their misfortune, their principal magazine had blown up. On the 23d his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty pa&s;&s;ed the Oder about 20 miles to the north-ea&s;t of Cu&s;trin.</P>
<P>As the greate&s;t Generals have never been known to be without their failings, that of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty is, perhaps, a too great di&s;regard for his enemies. He con&s;idered the Ru&s;&s;ians as being Barbarians, without reflecting that they were Barbarians who never knew how to yield, and that they were commanded by officers of expe|rience, who knew how to turn that barbari&s;m, which he affected to de&s;pi&s;e, into &s;teady courage and military di&s;cipline, &s;o as to baffle all the efforts of more active valour. On hearing of his having cro&s;&s;ed the Oder, they took po&s;t between the villages of Zwickau and Zorndorff. His Ma|je&s;ty at fir&s;t attempted to put in practice one of tho&s;e military motions in which he had been often &s;ucce&s;sful, by turning the left flank of the enemy and attacking them in the rear; but the Ru&s;&s;ians fore&s;eeing his de&s;ign, had thrown them|&s;elves into a kind of hollow &s;quare, which pre|&s;ented him every way with a front fortified by artillery and chevaux de frize. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary for the King to attack them with his artillery. The cannonading began at nine in the morning by a mo&s;t dreadful di&s;charge of great and &s;mall artillery, in which the Pru&s;&s;ians were greatly &s;uperior, and which did amazing execution
<PB N="72" REF="75">
upon their enemies, who &s;tood as if they had been invulnerable, and &s;upplied every vacuity in their ranks with unparallelled readine&s;s and alacrity. This behaviour was new to the Pru&s;&s;ians, who, &s;eeing their enemy, in a manner, court death, made a pau&s;e, which the fir&s;t line of the Ru&s;&s;ians, hav|ing exhau&s;ted their &s;hot, improved into a panic, by breaking in upon them with their &s;words and bayonets, and which forced the hitherto im|penetrable body of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry to recoil. This change in the fortune of the day, effected by their broken and defeated battalions, was &s;o unexpected by the Ru&s;&s;ian Generals, that they had made no di&s;po&s;itions for &s;upporting their in|fantry by their cavalry; but his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who&s;e pre&s;ence of mind never fails him, brought the whole of his cavalry under General Seidlitz to his center, and they made head again&s;t the fatigued Ru&s;&s;ians, while the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry recovering from their di&s;order, and &s;tung with what had happened under the eye of their &s;o|vereign, formed behind them, and made &s;o dreadful a charge upon the un&s;upported Ru&s;&s;ian battalions, that they recovered the field. When the Ru&s;&s;ians are beat, in&s;tead of flying they grow &s;tupid, unle&s;s they are commanded by Generals in whom they have a great confidence; but at this time they were under no command, and unable to advance further, they remained where they were, plundering their own baggage, and drinking brandy wherever they could find it. To encrea&s;e the confu&s;ion, the wind blew the du&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;moke directly into their faces, while thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> cool enemies, by their King's directions, im|proved every advantage. The Ru&s;&s;ians, now unable to di&s;tingui&s;h friends from foes, attacked each other, and being at la&s;t wedged very clo&s;e their fir&s;t and &s;econd lines mu&s;t have been totally

de&s;troyed, had not their Generals with their unbroken cavalry, fallen upon the right wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians, now fatigued with conque&s;t and carnage, and favoured the broken Ru&s;&s;ians &s;o far as to give them an opportunity of forming anew, and marching to an advantageous ground. The lo&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ians in this battle amounted to above 21,000 men, in killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom were 939 officers. Ten thou&s;and were killed upon the &s;pot, and the wounds of above 6000 more proved mortal. That of the Pru&s;&s;ians did not exceed 2000 in the whole, and the Ru&s;&s;ian military che&s;t, and a noble train of artillery, fell into their hands.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian Generals having collected the broken remains of their army, gave orders for a retreat, and they marched to Land&s;perg on the frontiers of Poland, while their General in chief, Fermor, reque&s;ted the King of Pru&s;&s;ia for leave to bury the dead.</P>
<P>The glorious victory as was before mentioned, gave no relief to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; laurels and thorns grew on every &s;ide of him. He made di&s;po&s;itions for improving his victory, but danger called his attention towards Saxony, where Mar|&s;hal Daun, whom nature did not &s;eem to &s;it for offen&s;ive mea&s;ures in the field, unle&s;s he was either compelled to them by nece&s;&s;ity, or invited by a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, was encamped at Stol|pen to the Ea&s;tward of the Elbe; a &s;ituation in which he found more &s;afety than glory, tho' it covered the operations of the Au&s;trian arms under the Generals Harrach, de Ville, and Laudohn.

Daun's not proceeding to offen&s;ive operations, in the ab&s;ence of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, again&s;t Prince Henry in Saxony, over whom he had &s;o great a &s;uperiority, did not proceed from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the court of Vienna. They had promi&s;ed the King of Poland and all their allies, that the recovery of Saxony &s;hould be the chief, if not the only object of the campaign; but it is pre&s;umable that they would have been much better plea&s;ed to have recovered Sile&s;ia. While Count Daun over-awed Prince Henry, and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was employing his army again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, Laudohn lay upon the borders of Brandenburgh with the apparent intention of drawing the Pru&s;&s;ian troops to the Northern, while Harrach, and de Ville acted in the Southern parts of that Province. The &s;trong fortre&s;s of Sonne&s;tein in the neighbourhood of Dre&s;den, which had long overawed Daun, &s;urrendered in a very unaccountable manner after a few hours faint re&s;i&s;tance, with a garri&s;on of 1400 men, to the Au&s;trian General Maguire, on the 5th of September. After this Daun propo&s;ed to execute the plan he had formed in the beginning of the campaign, that of pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe and putting Prince Henry between his fire and that of the army of the Empire, and thereby cutting of the communication between the Prince and Dre&s;|den; but his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was by this time, September 11, on the borders of Saxony. The terror of his approach obliged Laudohn to forego his advantages in the Lower Lu&s;atia, and to fall back upon Daun, who was &s;o far from executing his grand plan that he retired to Zittau, &s;o as to have Bohemia at his back, while the army of the Empire remained inactive in the &s;trong po&s;t of Pirna which they had &s;eized.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78">
All tho&s;e glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who in one campaign had performed actions that in other ages would have acquired Empires, gave him rather re&s;pite than &s;ecurity. The Swedes on hearing of his victory at Zorndorff had retired in di&s;order, but &s;till kept their arms in their hands without evacuating his dominions. The Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;till a &s;trong footing in the mo&s;t populous parts of his territories, and he had no &s;uperiority in Saxony but that of general&s;hip and reputation. As no remarkable action hap|pened between him and his enemies till the 14th of October, we are in the interval to attend the operations of the French and the allies on the &s;ide of We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand had made an admirable di&s;po&s;ition of his army along the Lippe, and the Prince of Y&s;enburg, with the few forces he had under him, maintained his po&s;ts upon the We&s;er; &s;o that the French had hitherto made very little progre&s;s either again&s;t He&s;&s;e or Hanover. The French therefore came to a re&s;olution of &s;trengthening the Prince de Soubi&s;e's army, &s;o as to enable him to di&s;lodge the Prince of Y&s;en|burg from the We&s;er, and to open a pa&s;&s;age into the Landgraviate. Prince Ferdinand, aware of their intention, &s;ent the Prince a detachment under General Oberg; but after it had joined him, all the force of the allies in the Landgraviate did not exceed 15,000 men. They were attack|ed on the 30th of September at Lanwerenhagen by the Prince of Soubi&s;e, at the head of about 30,000, defeated, and forced to take &s;helter in &s;ome &s;trong grounds covered with woods in the neighbourhood, with the lo&s;s of about 1500 men. Prince Ferdinand flow to their relief &s;o critically, that the Prince was enabled to join him at Rheda. The defeat however enabled
<PB N="76" REF="79">
the French to pu&s;h their parties of light hor&s;e to the very gates of Hanover.</P>
<P>The in&s;incerity of the court of Vienna, ap|peared now more glaringly. Daun in&s;tead of pu&s;hing the advantage he had obtained at Hoh|kirch, by attempting the relief of Saxony, thro' his inactivity and the few motions he made, plainly evinced that all he intended was to cover the operations of the Au&s;trian Generals in Sile|&s;ia, where they had already be&s;ieged Nei&s;s a city 20 miles South by We&s;t of Bre&s;lau, and lying near the confines of the Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia. The point was embarra&s;&s;ing to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, whether he &s;hould hazard a battle, leave Saxony expo&s;ed, or march to Sile&s;ia. He &s;oon deter|mined his operations. Having received large reinforcements from his brother's army, he left his camp at Dobre&s;chtz the night of the 24th of October, and without oppo&s;ition from the enemy reached the plain of Gorlitz; where he defeated a party of Au&s;trians who wanted to fortify them|&s;elves there. This march ea&s;ed him of all ap|prehen&s;ions from Daun's army, and, in fact, bla&s;ted the laurels he had acquired at Hohkirch. Daun, as if a&s;hamed to be outwitted, &s;ent Laudohn to harra&s;s his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty with 24,000 men, and &s;trong reinforcements to the Generals Har&s;ch and de Ville, who had not only be&s;ieged Nei&s;s, but blockaded Co&s;el. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e impediments, conti|nued his march; and Daun &s;eeing that he could not prevent the relief of Sile&s;ia, on the 6th of November pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe at Pirna, and ad|vanced towards Dre&s;den, from which the Pru&s;|&s;ian army, weakened by the detachments the King had drawn from it, had been obliged to re|tire to the We&s;tward; but before Daun could cut off their communication with that city, as
<PB N="77" REF="80">
the army of the Empire had cut it off from Leip|&s;ic, they threw them&s;elves into Dre&s;den all at once. Notwith&s;tanding, the advanced &s;ea&s;on, three great &s;ieges were undertaken in Saxony; that of Dre&s;den by Daun; that of Leip&s;ic by the imperial army; and that of Torgau by de|tachments from both.</P>
<P>By this time his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's approach towards Nei&s;s, the garri&s;on of which had de|fended them&s;elves with incomparable bravery ever &s;ince the 4th of Augu&s;t, on the 1&s;t of No|vember, both rai&s;ed that &s;iege and the blockade of Co&s;el, and obliged the Au&s;trians there to fall back upon Bohemia and the Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia. Upon this, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty again &s;et out for Saxony, where Daun had be&s;ieged Dre&s;den with 60,000 men. General Wedel, who had rid him|&s;elf of the Swedes in Pomerania, defended Tor|gau, and drove the Au&s;trians from it as far as Eulenburg. Count Schmettau commanded with an army of 12,000 men in Dre&s;den. The Elec|tors of Saxony had long been the patrons of in|genious arts and manufactures. Their &s;ubjects had rivalled the ancients in many curious works of the chi&s;el, the furnace, the laboratory, the needle, the loom, and the pencil, and they had greatly exceeded the Ea&s;terns, even the Chine&s;e them&s;elves, in their boa&s;ted productions of Por|celane. The &s;oil of the country, and the geni|us of the inhabitants, were wonderfully well adapted to the improvement of every manual art, and a long track of internal tranquility, while the flames of war raged all round, had ren|dered Saxony the paradi&s;e of Germany. Even the expence of its court, the mo&s;t luxurious of any in Europe, had contributed to enrich the in|habitants, who gave &s;pecimens of their wealth in the magnificence of their buildings. The
<PB N="78" REF="81">
&s;uburbs of Dre&s;den, where the mo&s;t con&s;iderable nobility, merchants and manufacturers re&s;ide, formed of them&s;elves a mo&s;t &s;uperb city; but unfortunately the builders of the hou&s;es had not reflected, that it was po&s;&s;ible &s;ome time or other Dre&s;den might be be&s;ieged; for the platforms of the &s;uburbs looked down on the battlements of the city.</P>
<P>Schmettau knew what advantage this circum|&s;tance pre&s;ented to Daun, and that the &s;uburbs were untenable. He gave Daun his option, either to &s;ee them in flames, or de&s;i&s;t from his operations. Daun threatened him with the con|&s;equences of &s;o barbarous a proceeding, and &s;o contrary to the rules of war. Schmettau ju&s;ti|fy'd him&s;elf by nece&s;&s;ity, which &s;upercedes all other con&s;iderations, and by the duty he owed to his ma&s;ter, to whom alone he was accountable. Daun threatened to make him per&s;onally an&s;wer|able to him&s;elf; upon which Schmettau replied, that he not only would burn the &s;uburbs, but if the city was attacked, that he would defend it &s;treet by &s;treet, and at la&s;t take refuge in the ca&s;|tle, where the Royal Family re&s;ided, and defend that likewi&s;e. This an&s;wer being made public, brought the magi&s;trates and the chief inhabitants upon their knees before Daun, and the Royal Family implored him with all the moving elo|quence of di&s;tre&s;s to change his re&s;olution, which, if executed, would leave them de&s;titute of a habitation. Schmettau's an&s;wer was, that Daun, and not he, could grant their reque&s;t; and in|&s;tantly ordered the hou&s;es of the &s;uburbs to be filled with combu&s;tible materials, and at three in the morning, November 10, they were fired, and the hou&s;es in which they had been depo&s;ited were reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82">
Though the fact of this conflagration is lite|rally as we have related it, yet it admits of many alleviations. Schmettau did no more than barely what he was compelled to by nece&s;&s;ity. He even communicated to the magi&s;trates and inha|bitants the time and manner in which he was to proceed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in removing their goods, con&s;ulted with them upon the mo&s;t favourable way of executing his di&s;agreeable orders, which was done &s;o gently, that not above two hun|dred and fifty hou&s;es were con&s;umed; all which appeared afterwards from authentic evidences, judicially given by the magi&s;trates of Dre&s;den, and the parties them&s;elves who were the chief &s;ufferers, and which were publi&s;hed by his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty's command, to confute the exag|gerated repre&s;entations of the court of Vienna and its allies on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean while Mar&s;hal Daun had returned to his almo&s;t impregnable camp at Stolpen, while the King of Pru&s;&s;ia took po&s;t at Bautzen; a &s;i|tuation by which he was enabled to act as he plea&s;ed on the &s;ide either of Mi&s;nia or Lu&s;atia, his right wing extending to Holkirch. By this po&s;ition of the two armies, it appeared that the Mar&s;hal intended to cut off the King's commu|nication with Sile&s;ia, and the King to cut off that of the Mar&s;hal with Bohemia. The &s;itua|tion of his Maje&s;ty, however, was, upon the whole, the mo&s;t advantageous of the two. It will, perhaps, be ever a &s;ecret by what means Mar&s;hal Daun came to have intelligence that the Pru&s;&s;ians were more carele&s;sly encamped and more remi&s;s in their quarters than u&s;ual. He had before concerted mea&s;ures with the Prince of Deux Ponts, who commanded the army of the Empire, for a general battle, and in the dead of night, on the 14th of October, he ordered his
<PB N="80" REF="83">
army to decamp in three columns, and to march by different ways with the utmo&s;t &s;ilence, &s;o as all the three divi&s;ions &s;hould meet together near the Pru&s;&s;ian camp at five in the morning. His orders were obeyed with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ecrecy and preci&s;ion. The divi&s;ions in falling in with one another formed a regular line of battle, and al|mo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly attacked the Pru&s;&s;ian camp towards Holkirch, where it was weake&s;t. When one reflects upon the bravery and di&s;cipline of Daun's army, and the advantages under which this attack was made, he is apt to be a&s;toni&s;hed that a &s;ingle battalion of the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;hould e&s;cape. Not a &s;hot was fired by any of the Pru&s;|&s;ian out-guards, and their enemies were in the mid&s;t of their encampment, while they imagined them to be lying at Stolpen. It is &s;aid that Field Mar&s;hal Keith had the day before pointed out &s;ome weakne&s;&s;es in their encampment, which might be the rea&s;on why he was the fir&s;t Pru&s;|&s;ian General officer who got upon hor&s;eback and gave the alarm to his quarter. It is thought to be by his vigilance the army was &s;aved; for the &s;mall party under him gained time for their fellow &s;oldiers to put them&s;elves under arms. The Mar&s;hal, however, was killed upon the &s;pot by two mu&s;ket balls, and the head of Prince Fran|cis of Brun&s;wick was carried off by a cannon ball as he was mounting his hor&s;e. The death of tho&s;e two great officers, next in command as in merit to the King him&s;elf, &s;eemed to por|tend the entire lo&s;s of the army; but his Maje&s;ty had by this time a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops, and in per&s;on gave play to the Au&s;trians till others were formed. He perhaps never had &s;o difficult a part to act; for he did not now fight for victory, far le&s;s for glory, but for &s;afety. He flew from po&s;t to po&s;t with that inconceivable rapidity and pre|&s;ence
<PB N="81" REF="84">
of mind that &s;o &s;trongly marks his charac|ter. As his right wing was in the greate&s;t dan|ger he reinforced it from &s;ome battalions from his left, and endeavoured to recover the impor|tant po&s;t of Holkirch, from which his troops had been beaten in the beginning of the attack. This reinforcement enabled him after four bloody charges to retake the po&s;t, but the Au&s;trians, who were well acquainted with its importance, recovered it with a prodigious &s;laughter of their enemies, who in the mean time were on the point of overpowering General Retzow, who commanded the right of the Pru&s;&s;ians. At la&s;t his Maje&s;ty, after maintaining the fight for five hours, and lo&s;ing in killed, wounded, and pri|&s;oners above 7000 of his be&s;t men, ordered a retreat behind his artillery, which was placed in the middle of the camp, and which with the help of his cavalry put a &s;top to all pur&s;uit from the Au&s;trians, who&s;e killed and wounded a|mounted to above 5000. All the further con&s;e|quences of this bloody action were, that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Brautzen, but extended his right wing towards Wei&s;&s;en|burg. The bare relation of this affair excites in the mind of the reader more exalted ideas of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's abilities in war that can ari&s;e from the mo&s;t &s;plendid of his victories.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians had been &s;o &s;everely handled at Zorndorff, that they remained in their camp near Land&s;perg without making any motion till the 21&s;t of September, when they began their march towards Pomerania, and there laid &s;iege to the town of Colberg. This place, though in|con&s;iderable in it&s;elf, was of infinite importance to the Ru&s;&s;ians, by its being a &s;ea-port, from whence they might receive provi&s;ions and rein|forcements, without being expo&s;ed to the dan|ger
<PB N="82" REF="85">
of &s;tarving Brandenburgh, or to marches in&s;upportably long and laborious. Hitherto his Britannic Maje&s;ty had ordered his Mini&s;ter at the court of Peter&s;burgh to omit nothing that her Ru&s;&s;ian Imperial Maje&s;ty could rea&s;onably expect or de&s;ire, to buy off her inveterate enmity towards Pru&s;&s;ia, and he was not without hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. But the &s;iege of Colberg proved to all Europe, not only that &s;he was immovable in her purpo&s;e; but that the Empre&s;s Queen was determined to &s;acrifice the &s;afety of Germany, and even of her own dominions to her re&s;ent|ment, &s;ince nothing had at all times been deemed more impolitic in the Germanic &s;y&s;tem, than to &s;uffer the Ru&s;&s;ians to get footing by &s;ea in the Empire. It was now more than &s;u&s;pected that her Ru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had far greater views than that of a&s;&s;i&s;ting her &s;i&s;ter Empre&s;s, and that &s;he intended <HI>to take and hold.</HI> Colberg, though poorly garri&s;oned, and &s;till more weakly forti|fied, held out under Major Heydon, its Gover|nor, for 26 days, again&s;t an army of 15,000 be|&s;iegers, who were at la&s;t &s;hamefully obliged to quit their enterprize; but they revenged their di&s;grace by perpetrating, wherever they went, the mo&s;t unheard of inhumanities upon the de|fencele&s;s inhabitants; for the &s;everal &s;tages of their marches were traceable by fire &s;moke and ruin.</P>
<P>It was in vain for Daun while the flames were raging, as was before mentioned, to renew, as he did, his threats again&s;t Schmettau. Perhaps they proceeded not &s;o much from concern for the &s;ufferers, as from his conviction that he would now find it extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to take the city. He accordingly, upon the approach of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, de|camped from before Dre&s;den on the 17th of Nov. and the King on the 20th after joining his
<PB N="83" REF="86">
troops under Count Dohna and General Wedel, made a kind of triumphal entry into Dre&s;den. When we reflect upon the va&s;t provocations his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had received, the dangers and labours he had undergone, the blood and trea&s;ure he had expended, and the ince&s;&s;ant bodily toils he was every day expo&s;ed to, but above all the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of his finances, we need not be &s;urprized that he now forgot his u&s;ual modera|tion. He declared that he would no longer con&s;ider Saxony as a depo&s;ite, but as a conquered country, and he inflicted &s;ome unbecoming &s;e|verities to oblige the Magi&s;trates and chief inha|bitants to draw upon their foreign corre&s;pondents for large &s;ums for his u&s;e. The exacting tho&s;e impo&s;ts, however, were not unju&s;tifiable, if he con&s;idered Saxony as a conquered country. The que&s;tion is, whether it &s;trictly was &s;o; he cer|tainly once had received it as a depo&s;ite, and it did not appear, that either the King of Poland, or the inhabitants, had done any thing again&s;t him to change the tenure of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o as to con&s;titute that kind of oppo&s;ition which ju&s;tifies conque&s;t. Tho&s;e points, however, cannot be here di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. It would be iniquitous to clo&s;e our Martial Review for this year without doing ju&s;tice to the glorious actions performed by &s;epa|rate commanders at &s;ea, the relation of which is, properly &s;peaking, unconnected with the plan of our narrative.</P>
<P>On the 28th of February the &s;quadron under Admiral O&s;borne, between Cape De Gatt and Carthagena, fell in with M. du Que&s;ne in the Foudroyant of 80, the Orphcus of 64, the Oriflame of 50, and Pleiade of 24 guns, as they were &s;ailing from Toulon, in order to reinforce the French &s;quadron under M. de Clue at Cartha|gena. They di&s;per&s;ed and took different cour&s;es
<PB N="84" REF="87">
on &s;eeing the Engli&s;h &s;quadron. About &s;even in the evening, Capt. Storr, in the Revenge of 64, &s;upported by Capt. Hughes in the Berwick of 64, and Capt. Evans in the Pre&s;ton of 50 guns, took the Orpheus, commanded by M. de Herville with 502 men. Capt. Gardiner in the Mon|mouth of 64, &s;upported by Capt. Stanhope in the Swift&s;ure of 70, and Capt. Hervey in the Hamp|ton-court of 64 guns, about one in the morning, took the Foudroyant, on board of which was the Marquis du Que&s;ne, Chief d'E&s;cadre, with 800 men. Capt. Rowley in the Montague of 60, and Capt. Montague in the Monarch of 74, ran the Oriflame a&s;hore under the ca&s;tle of Aiglos, where &s;he was &s;aved only by the re&s;pect which the Engli&s;h had for the neutrality of the Portugue&s;e. One circum&s;tance in the engagement does immortal honour to the brave Capt. Gardiner, who lo&s;t his life in it. It had been a vulgar notion that the &s;uperior weight of metal which the French &s;hips carry, rendered them an over|match for the Briti&s;h, even for tho&s;e of an equal number of guns. It was the apprehen&s;ion of this that made Admiral Byng decline fighting Gali&s;&s;oniere in the Foudroyant, while Gardiner, who was then his Captain, publickly declared that he &s;hould not be afraid to fight the Foudroy|out in an Engli&s;h 70 or 64 gun &s;hip, and on this occa&s;ion he was as good as his word, tho' it appeared upon an admea&s;urement, that the Foudroyant, not to mention her va&s;t &s;uperiority in weight of metal and number of guns, was as broad as an Engli&s;h fir&s;t rate, and 12 foot longer. After Captain Gardiner was killed in the be|ginning of the action, his fir&s;t Lieutenant, Carket, took the command, and behaved &s;o bravely, that after killing 200 of the Foudroyant's men, with the lo&s;s of 150 of his own, he forced the French
<PB N="85" REF="88">
&s;hip to &s;trike. Before this could be done, Capt. Stanhope in the Swift&s;ure came up, but though a &s;uperior &s;hip to the Monmouth, M. du Que&s;ne would acknowledge no other conqueror but Carket, to whom he politely re&s;igned his &s;word.</P>
<P>This year likewi&s;e brought an account of a gallant action performed towards the latter end of the la&s;t by Captain Forre&s;t in the We&s;t-In|dies, who with his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips Edinburgh, Dreadnought, Augu&s;ta, and a &s;loop, had blocked up the harbour of Cape Francois for &s;ome weeks; but on the 21&s;t of October they were attacked by all the French fleet there, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even &s;ail of large &s;hips, a &s;chooner and a pilot boat, well manned with &s;oldiers on board, and their full compliment of guns. The engagement was very hot for two hours and a half, and the French having lo&s;t about 300 men, and as many wound|ed, were beat back to their harbour; but the Engli&s;h had &s;uffered &s;o much in their rigging and hulls, that they were di&s;abled from pur&s;uing them.</P>
<P>On the 29th of May, the Dor&s;et, Captain Dennis, of 64 guns and 520 men, gave chace to the Rai&s;onable, a French 70 gun &s;hip, with 630 men on board, commanded by the Prince de Mombazon, who, after having 61 men killed and 100 wounded, &s;truck to Captain Dennis, who&s;e lo&s;s was 15 men killed and 21 wounded. The Rai&s;onable was a new &s;hip, and one of the fine&s;t in France. It may be proper here to ob|&s;erve, that the taking of the Foudroyant and Rai&s;onable by &s;hips of inferior &s;trength has ever &s;ince &s;ilenced the ridiculous boa&s;ts of the French, who pretended that they were always an over|match for us when we were not &s;uperior in &s;hips, guns, and weight of metal.</P>

In Augu&s;t this year; the electoral finances of Hanover were &s;o much exhau&s;ted by the long continuance of the war, that his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty was obliged to have recour&s;e to a &s;ub&s;cripti|on for 200,000l. which was rai&s;ed by way of loan in London in a few days, or rather hours. We mention this incident the rather becau&s;e it &s;erves to remove a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as if his late Ma|je&s;ty had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a va&s;t per&s;onal e&s;tate, which he certainly was not, as he paid the full legal intere&s;t for the above loan. On the 16th of September the public was enter|tained with a magnificent di&s;play of the cannon and mortars taken at Cherbourg, which pa&s;&s;ed in a grand proce&s;&s;ion from Hyde-Park, through the city, to the Tower. We are likewi&s;e not to forget the trial and condemnation of one Hen&s;ey an Iri&s;hman, who pretended to be a Doctor of Phy&s;ic, for trea&s;onably corre&s;ponding with the enemies of Great-Britain, whom he endeavoured to apprize, as far as his &s;hallow in|formation could reach, of the de&s;tination of our fleets and armies. The government, however, found him &s;o in&s;ignificant in his profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;py, that he was pardoned.</P>
<P>At the opening of the year 1759, the King|dom of Pru&s;&s;ia was in the hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians, and the Dutchy of Cleves in tho&s;e of the Au|&s;trians, but held by the French. His Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony, and received from Great-Britain a &s;ub&s;idy of 750,000l. Not|with&s;tanding this, his &s;ituation was far from be|ing de&s;ireable. Though he could rai&s;e money, he could not re-animate men, and the fine armies with which he had done &s;uch wonders, were now no more; nor was he longer a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the coun&s;els of tho&s;e able Generals, whom fatigue, di&s;ea&s;es, and the fate of war, had carried off.
<PB N="87" REF="90">
It was but a &s;mall comfort to him that his ene|mies, the French particularly, were as much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as he was, and the general bankruptcy, which was then &s;aid to prevail in France, was found to be little more than a fiction, invented by that court, to prevail with its &s;ubjects to re|pleni&s;h the royal coffers. The great, and in|deed the only, &s;upport of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was the wealth, the power, the &s;pirit, and pro&s;|perity of Great-Britain, but even that could not penetrate into the internal parts of Germany, where Prince Ferdinand had failed in an at|tempt to di&s;lodge the Duke de Broglio near Ber|gen. In the mean while, Prince Henry of Pru&s;|&s;ia commanded in Saxony, and his army entered Bohemia in two columns with great &s;ucce&s;s. General Hul&s;en, who commanded one of the columns, defeated a large body of Au&s;trians at Pa&s;berg, and made about 2000 pri&s;oners, with the lo&s;s of only 70 men, while the other co|lumn penetrated as far as Lobo&s;chutz and Lei|meritz, and both returned to Saxony with ho&s;t|ages for the contributions they had exacted. After this the Prince entered Franconia by the way of Hoff, and defeated a body of Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts under General Maguire. The con&s;equence was that the Bi&s;hoprics of Bamberg and Wurtzburg were laid under contribution, and the Pru&s;&s;ians, in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bam|berg, were guilty of &s;ome unju&s;tifiable irregula|rities. During Prince Henry's ab&s;ence in Fran|conia, a body of Au&s;trians penetrated into Sax|ony, and the Ru&s;&s;ians advanced towards Sile&s;ia, while the French, who had been greatly elated by defeating Prince Ferdinand at Bergen, made a mo&s;t alarming proce&s;s in He&s;&s;e, and in the Bi&s;hopric of Paderborn.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91">
In the mean while, a &s;quadron of nine &s;hips of the line, with 60 tran&s;ports, containing &s;ix regiments of foot, were &s;ent by the Briti&s;h Mi|ni&s;try to attack Martinico. The land forces were commanded by General Hop&s;on, an officer who&s;e age and infirmities, as well as natural cau|tion, di&s;qualified him for &s;uch a &s;ervice, and the &s;ea force was under the command of Commo|dore Moore. A landing was effected upon the i&s;land, but through &s;ome fatality, the cau&s;e of which has never yet been cleared up, the at|tempt proved ineffectual after repeated efforts. The troops, however, had the &s;pirit to de&s;ire to be led again&s;t the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, an object of as much importance as Martinico, though of le&s;s renown. It happened that General Hop&s;on, who was a very worthy man and good officer, died on the 27th of February, 1759, and his command devolved upon General Barrington, who, after &s;urmounting difficulties almo&s;t incre|dible, on the fir&s;t of May &s;ubjected the whole i&s;land and its dependencies to the Briti&s;h crown. Scarcely was the capitulation which effected this &s;ubjection &s;igned, when M. Bompart, General of the French Caribbees, landed at St. Ann's, a port belonging to Guadaloupe, with 600 regu|lar troops, 2000 buccaniers, and a va&s;t quantity of arms and ammunition. But this body hear|ing of the capitulation being &s;igned, immediate|ly di&s;appeared, though had they landed but a few hours before, the &s;ubjection of the i&s;land by the Briti&s;h arms mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have been doubtful. On the 25th of May, the i&s;land of Marigalante &s;urrendered upon much the &s;ame terms as had been granted to that of Guadaloupe.</P>
<P>It is more than probable that the great atten|tention which the French court gave to the af|fairs of Germany, contributed not incon&s;idera|bly
<PB N="89" REF="92">
to the Briti&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;es in America and the We&s;t-Indies. This attention was &s;o great, that after Prince Ferdinand's defeat at Bergen, they took Ritberg and Minden, with &s;everal other places of con&s;equence; and at la&s;t d'Armentieres, one of their Generals, be&s;ieged and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of We&s;el, where the garri&s;on of 4000 men were made pri&s;oners of war. The Mar&s;hal Contades, a young officer, of &s;ome &s;pirit but no great note, then commanded the French in Germany. He was a favourite of the Duke de Bellei&s;le, who directed all his operations, and who in July 1759, thought that the conque&s;t of Hanover by the French, was an event not to be doubted of; and the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible people in England were not of a very different opinion. The ar|chives and mo&s;t of the valuable effects of that Electorate were &s;ent to Stade, to be conveyed with the fir&s;t opportunity to England, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the French army near Minden was &s;uch as encouraged them to boa&s;t and believe, that the allied army under Prince Ferdinand would lay down its arms without a &s;troke. They were then encamped at Peter&s;hagen about nine miles from the French.</P>
<P>They who are conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory know, what a great &s;hare fortune has in the mo&s;t deci|&s;ive military operations, and how very apt man|kind is to attribute fortunate events to &s;agacious fore&s;ight and wi&s;e di&s;po&s;itions. Without dero|gating from tho&s;e of Prince Ferdinand, we mu&s;t be of opinion, that his glorious &s;ucce&s;s at the battle of Minden was, in the main, owing to cau&s;es he could not rea&s;onably fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>On the 28th of July he detached the Heredi|tary Prince of Brun&s;wick with 6000 men, with orders to take a compa&s;s towards the enemy's left flank, and to cut off their communication
<PB N="90" REF="93">
with Paderborn. Next day, Prince Ferdinand left his camp on the We&s;er, but left a &s;trong body of his troops under General Waggenheim intrenched on the borders of that river, and &s;up|ported with artillery. Thus the allied army i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> fact was divided into three bodies, and the defea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of any of them probably mu&s;t decide the fate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the other two. The French thought nothing was more ea&s;y than to defeat the body unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wangenheim, by which Prince Ferdinand mu&s;t be cut off from all communication with the We|&s;er, and be thereby compelled to &s;urrender at di&s;|cretion. This was deemed to be the more prac|ticable, as Prince Ferdinand, with the divi&s;ion under his command, was then &s;uppo&s;ed to be at Halen, by which po&s;ition the French were in hopes of being able to cut off his communication with Wangenheim's corps, which was to be fir&s;t attacked by the Duke de Broglio. Early on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t the French left their advantageous po&s;t near Minden, and advanced with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;urance of having a cheap conque&s;t of the divi|&s;ion under Wangenheim: but Broglio gaining &s;ome heights, was amazed at &s;eeing the whole allied army drawn up in good order, &s;o as to form in fact but one body. He advanced &s;o far that he could not retreat without fighting, and the di&s;|po&s;ition of their army was &s;uch as indicated that they did not expect to fight at all, their center being compo&s;ed of their cavalry. The Engli&s;h infantry had at once the po&s;t of danger and glory. They were attacked by the French cavalry, which were deemed to be irre&s;i&s;table, and were &s;upport|ed by their infantry on the flanks; but nothing could with&s;tand the addre&s;s, courage, and intre|pidity of the Briti&s;h infantry, &s;upported by a very few Hanoverians. Their boa&s;ted cavalry gave way before the regiments of Walgrave and
<PB N="91" REF="94">
King&s;ley, nor was there a mu&s;quet in the Briti&s;h army that was not choaked with the blood of their enemies; &s;o irre&s;i&s;tably did they handle their bayonets. As &s;oon as the French began to fly before the Briti&s;h fury, Prince Ferdinand, who certainly had no ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect a victory, ordered the Briti&s;h cavalry to advance and com|plete the rout. The order was not preci&s;e, and, upon the face of the evidence given on the trial of the noble Lord who commanded them, could not be complied with without explanation, and while that was obtaining the French found means to retreat to Minden, but without being &s;o totally defeated, as they mu&s;t have been had the Briti&s;h cavalry acted. In the mean while, the detach|ment under the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wic, defeated a divi&s;ion of the French army under the Duke de Broglio, and forced it to take refuge in Minden, by which the French lo&s;t all their ad|vantageous po&s;ts on the We&s;er, and were obliged to re&s;ign all the promi&s;ing glories of the cam|paign. Their lo&s;s on this occa&s;ion amounted to about 7000 men, and that of the allies to about 2000, of whom about 1200 were Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>The eclat attending this battle made an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mind of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, which was by no means favourable for the noble Lord who that day commanded the Briti&s;h troops. Prince Ferdinand had in an oblique manner re|flected upon his backwardne&s;s, and the noble Lord was incautious enough to in&s;i&s;t upon a mo&s;t uncon&s;titutional trial for di&s;obeying the orders of a General, who by the laws of England was not qualified to give him orders, though he had &s;ubmitted to receive them. The event of the trial was unfavourable for his Lord&s;hip; but with what ju&s;tice let tho&s;e determine who at this day read it cooly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately. We may ven|ture
<PB N="92" REF="95">
to affirm that the victory of Minden was one of tho&s;e ha&s;ty, but happy, productions of a next to enthu&s;ia&s;tic valour; and owing to that rapidity of courage peculiar to the Engli&s;h, of which foreign|ers can have no idea, and which &s;ets at nought all &s;y&s;tems of war.</P>
<P>It is with regret we mention, that the con&s;e|quences of the battle of Minden were not an|&s;werable to the amazing valour and conduct which obtained it. War is the trade of &s;oldiers of fortune, and a gainful trade it is. Prince Ferdinand obliged the French to retire towards Ca&s;&s;el, but it was the 11th of September before the incon&s;iderable ca&s;tle of Marpourg &s;urrender|ed to the allies, after having kept them at play &s;o long, that, at the end of the campaign, the French found them&s;elves in a condition to begin another. Mun&s;ter &s;till continued in their hands, and Imhoff, a Hanoverian General, was detach|ed by Prince Ferdinand to be&s;iege it; but he was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege by d'Armentieres. We are not authorized to make any reflections on the &s;ub&s;equent operations of this campaign. It is &s;uf|ficient to &s;ay, that the de&s;pondency of the French is an evidence that the General of the allied army did not improve it to the full advantage which the Briti&s;h valour had thrown &s;o unexpectedly in|to his lap. Contades and Broglio recriminated on each other, and d'Etrees, a General of greater experience and capacity than both, was &s;ent to their camp to prevent an open rupture; and to reduce the troops, who held their Generals in the utmo&s;t contempt, to their duty; which he effected at the mortifying expence of &s;erving under his giddy-headed inferiors; an example which it is to be wi&s;hed might be copied by Bri|ti&s;h commanders.</P>

To do the French ju&s;tice, they are &s;eldom at a lo&s;s for re&s;ources. They had been unfortunate and di&s;graced in Germany; but a ma&s;terly and powerful inva&s;ion of Great Britain, towards the clo&s;e of the year 1759, was to remedy all mi&s;|carriages. Three embarkations for that purpo&s;e were mentioned. One under Thurot was de&s;tined again&s;t Scotland. This Thurot was an intelli|gent, enterprizing adventurer, humane in his manners, and fortunate in his undertakings. His birth was ob&s;cure, but his notions, at a time when a total degeneracy of the French prevailed, rendered, in France, tho&s;e abilities illu&s;trious, which, in England, could not have intitled him to a lieutenancy on board a &s;hip of war. The &s;econd embarkation was to have been performed at Havre, and the other &s;ea-ports of Normandy, and was de&s;igned immediately again&s;t England. The third was to have been made from Vannes, in the Lower Brittany, under the Duke D'Ai|guillon, who, from his unmanly di&s;comfiture of the Engli&s;h at St. Cas, had now acquired &s;ome reputation in arms. Tho&s;e appearances were threatening, and the more &s;o, as Admiral Bo&s;|cawen, who commanded the Engli&s;h fleet in the Mediterranean, was obliged to &s;ail for Gibraltar to refit, and to leave the French &s;quadron at Toulon at liberty to come out of that harbour. The French made the be&s;t of their opportunity, and &s;ailed under the command of M. de la Clue. Bo&s;cawen &s;ailed Augu&s;t the 14th, and had with him fourteen &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates. Tho&s;e under de la Clue were only twelve, but their force, upon the whole, far exceeded that of Bo&s;cawen's &s;quadron. They had arrived near Gibraltar, when the Engli&s;h Admiral, hearing of their &s;ailing, in two hours put to &s;ea, and overtook &s;ome of their &s;hips at Cape Lagos in
<PB N="94" REF="97">
Portugal, where, after an engagement, in which his coolne&s;s and intrepidity were equally remark|able, he gave them a total defeat. The Ocean and Redoutable, two of the be&s;t &s;hips in the French navy, were run a&s;hore and burnt. The Centaure and the Mode&s;te, two other of their capital &s;hips, were taken, and the others, with great difficulty, took refuge in the harbour of Cadiz.</P>
<P>This &s;evere blow given to the French marine, did not deter them from their intended inva&s;ion of Great Britain. A fleet was equipped at Bre&s;t, of which M. de Conflans had the command, and which was to cover their grand expedition again&s;t England. This fleet, however, was blocked up by Admiral Hawke, who at the &s;ame time de|tached &s;ome &s;hips to keep an eye upon Vannes, while Commodore Boys was &s;tationed before Dunkirk, and Admiral Rodney bombarded Havre. All this happened in the depth of winter, when the French were favoured by a violent &s;torm, which forced Admiral Hawke from his &s;tation off Bre&s;t to run into Torbay with his whole fleet. The French lo&s;t no time, but put to &s;ea on the 14th of November, which happened to be the very day on which Admiral Hawke left Torbay, and directed his cour&s;e to Quiberon bay, where he expected the French fleet would rendezvous, and where, after meeting with various di&s;ap|pointments through contrary winds, he at la&s;t di&s;covered the head-mo&s;t &s;hips of the enemy bear|ing to the northward, between the main land of France and the i&s;land of Bellei&s;le. This hap|pened on the 20th of November.</P>
<P>It is evident from what followed, that the amazing intrepidity of the Briti&s;h Admiral and officers di&s;abled the French both as to courage and conduct. They had tru&s;ted to the danger of
<PB N="95" REF="98">
the navigation, nor did they imagine that the Engli&s;h would dare to attack them on a coa&s;t to which they were &s;trangers, and which, beyond any almo&s;t of the known world, was full of &s;hoals, &s;ands, &s;hallows and rocks. Conflans, be|fore he could re&s;olve how to proceed, found him|&s;elf defeated. In two hours after he was attacked by Hawke, two of his &s;hips of the line were &s;unk, and a third &s;truck. Hawke's great aim was at the Soleil Royal, the mo&s;t capital &s;hip in the French navy, and commanded by Conflans in per&s;on. He ordered the ma&s;ter of his own &s;hip to pa&s;s all the &s;hips of the enemy, and to lay him along &s;ide the French Admiral, but be|fore that could be done, a French &s;hip of &s;eventy guns, which nobly interpo&s;ed, was &s;unk by one broad&s;ide of his re&s;erved fire. In &s;hort, had not the French been favoured by night, their whole fleet mu&s;t have been de&s;troyed or taken.</P>
<P>Seven of their &s;hips, after throwing over-board all their guns, e&s;caped into the river Vilaine, and about as many made for other ports. A dreadful hurricane blew during all the night after this action, and nothing was to be heard but &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s on all hands, friends and enemies being blended in one common danger. Com|mon humanity would have prevailed upon the Engli&s;h to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted even an enemy amid&s;t &s;uch indi&s;criminate di&s;tre&s;s; but they perceived all efforts of that kind were impracticable, and could terminate only in their own ruin, without affording the &s;malle&s;t relief to the French; they were therefore obliged to wait for the return of day, and then they found that the French Ad|miral had run his own, and another capital &s;hip, the Heros, on &s;hore. His own &s;hip was burnt by him&s;elf, and the Heros by the Engli&s;h. It was thought, that this action, in which the enemy
<PB N="96" REF="99">
had four capital &s;hips de&s;troyed, one taken, and the re&s;t of their fleet di&s;abled, &s;hattered, and di&s;per&s;ed, would have been deci&s;ive of all future marine operations between the Engli&s;h and their enemies. The public re&s;ounded with exultati|ons on that account, and nothing but &s;ongs of triumph was to be read in our news papers.</P>
<P>An event which happened about the &s;ame time redoubled the exultations, as was before menti|oned. The French government authentically acknowledged it&s;elf to be bankrupt, and &s;topt the payment of no le&s;s than eleven funds, for which their public faith was engaged. As if that had not been enough, a kind of begging ordnance was publi&s;hed, for all per&s;ons to bring in their plate to the mint; his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty began with his own, and affected to retrench his table, furniture, and plate, to tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, which a man of 200l. a year allows to his family in England. His example was followed by num|bers of his mo&s;t zealous &s;ubjects; nor were even the church plate and ornaments &s;pared.</P>
<P>It is true the money rai&s;ed by this expedient fell &s;hort of what might have been expected; but it is certain it did infinite &s;ervice to the French government. It awakened a &s;pirit of what we may call compa&s;&s;ionate loyalty, in the brea&s;t of its &s;ubjects, who now con&s;idered nothing but the unde&s;erved di&s;tre&s;s to which their &s;overeign was reduced. Cities, Corporations, and Companies, poured in their voluntary contributions for re|pairing their marine, and their armies in Ger|many were recruited with greater facility and a le&s;s expence than ever; &s;o that their force at the opening of the next campaign was far more for|midable than was expected. But this was not all. The Engli&s;h and their allies were impo&s;ed upon, and thrown off their guard by this pretended &s;hew
<PB N="97" REF="100">
of poverty. The operations of the war lan|gui&s;hed, on a pre&s;umption that the French could not continue it, and that they mu&s;t of cour&s;e agree to &s;uch terms as Great Britain &s;hould im|po&s;e. In all tho&s;e pre&s;umptions we were de|ceived, for the French at the very time when they declared them&s;elves bankrupt, had eleven millions &s;terling in ready money in their trea|&s;ury; but it is now time to vi&s;it a quarter of the globe we have not yet touched on.</P>
<P>The race of Tamerlane and the Moguls have continued from the time of that great conqueror, after being expelled out of Tartary and Per&s;ia, to govern India. Aurengzebe was the la&s;t Mo|narch who inherited the abilities of his great predece&s;&s;ors; for, after his death, an univer&s;al de|generacy took place; and, as is commonly the ca&s;e with great Monarchies, tho&s;e provinces which were the mo&s;t di&s;tant from the &s;eat of go|vernment affected an independency upon the Em|peror, or, as he is called, the Great Mogul. In proce&s;s of time the Governors of tho&s;e pro|vinces, who are called Nabobs, were little more than nominally &s;ubject to the imperial authority, and they acknowledged that &s;hadow of depen|dency, only becau&s;e it gave a &s;anction to their own power. Among&s;t the mo&s;t formidable of tho&s;e Governors was the Nabob of Bengal, who upon a frivolous pretext rai&s;ed a great army, and laid &s;iege to the Engli&s;h fort of Calcutta, which the Governor and the principal Briti&s;h inhabi|tants there abandoned, by &s;aving them&s;elves, and their mo&s;t valuable effects on board the &s;hips. The place, however, was bravely defended by Mr. Holwell; but on the 26th of June, 1756, it was taken by the Nabob, or, as he is called, the Subah or Viceroy of Bengal. This barba|rian, irritated by the oppo&s;ition he had met
<PB N="98" REF="101">
with, gave way to the inhumanity of his officers, who &s;hut up 146 Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in a narrow pri|&s;on, where after &s;uffering the mo&s;t excruciating torments by thir&s;t, and all kinds of agonies, no more than 23 per&s;ons came out alive next morn|ing. Of tho&s;e who were &s;aved, Mr. Holwell was one, and even the brea&s;t of the Subah &s;eemed to be affected with their &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>The glory of the Briti&s;h arms in the Ea&s;t-Indies, was, however, &s;oon retrieved. Admiral Wat&s;on in the beginning of the year 1756 at|tacked and de&s;troyed the re&s;idence of Angria the pirate, who had long been a declared enemy to the Engli&s;h. The Admiral afterwards &s;ailed with no more than three &s;hips of the line from Madra&s;s, and, after touching at the port of Bala|&s;ore, he entered the Ganges, where by taking Bu&s;budgia fort he opened a pa&s;&s;age to Calcutta, which he reduced in one day, as he did Hugly, another &s;ettlement higher up the Ganges. The Nabob drew together an army con&s;i&s;ting of 10,000 hor&s;e, and 12,000 foot; but on the 5th of February, 1757, they were defeated by a handful of Engli&s;h, and the Nabob was obliged to conclude a peace, by which our Ea&s;t-India company was rein&s;tated in all its priviledges and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, obtaining an immunity from taxes, and an indemnification for all they had &s;uffered by the taking of Calcutta. It was very ea&s;y to &s;ee that this accommodation with the Nabob would la&s;t no longer than &s;uited his own conve|niency, and that he would break it as &s;oon as he had concerted mea&s;ures with the French. The two Engli&s;h Admirals therefore, Wat&s;on and Pocock, in conjunction with Colonel Clive who commanded the land forces, attacked Chandena|gore, the chief &s;ettlement of the French in tho&s;e parts, and lying further up the river than Cal|cutta
<PB N="99" REF="102">
it&s;elf. Though the Engli&s;h fleet con&s;i&s;ted of no more than three &s;hips, and the land forces under Clive amounted only to 700 Europeans and 1600 black &s;oldiers, yet they attacked the place. The French were prepared to receive them, and &s;unk &s;everal large ve&s;&s;els both above and below their forts; for there were four in the whole. The operations of the Engli&s;h, however, both by &s;ea and land, were &s;o vigorous, that the gar|ri&s;on capitulated in le&s;s than three hours on the 24th of March. Five hundred Europeans and 700 blacks &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; 183 pieces of cannon were taken, and a large &s;um in ready money, with a va&s;t quantity of goods, became the property of the captors. It was ea&s;y to perceive that the Nabob Suraja Doula, the &s;ame who the preceding year had occa&s;ioned the ma&s;&s;acre at Calcutta, was &s;till in the French intere&s;t. The ferocity of his man|ners had di&s;gu&s;ted even his own &s;ubjects, and as &s;ucce&s;s is the only title that tho&s;e Nabobs can &s;hew for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Jaffier Ali Cawn, then a prin|cipal officer in his army, and one who pretended a legal right to the Nabob&s;hip, put him&s;elf at the head of a confederacy again&s;t him, and applied to the Engli&s;h for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>We have neither room nor inclination to enter upon particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of right between the two rival Nabobs, who are before mentioned. It is certain that the Engli&s;h very wi&s;ely agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t Jaffier, with whom they entered into a treaty, and Colonel Clive immediately took the field in his favour. The Admiral, to encrea&s;e the Co|lonel's force as much as he could, undertook to garri&s;on Chandenagore, and lent him 50 &s;eamen to &s;erve as gunners, while a twenty gun &s;hip was &s;tationed above Hugly, to pre&s;erve the communi|cation between the &s;ea and land forces. By this
<PB N="100" REF="103">
time the Nabob Suraja had a&s;&s;embled an army of 20,000 men, which were attacked by Colonel Clive on the 22d of June, and entirely defeated. This a&s;toni&s;hing event, Colonel Clive having with him fewer men than the enemy had En&s;igns in the field, encouraged Jaffier, who had re|mained inactive in the late battle, openly to de|clare his preten&s;ions to the Nabob&s;hip, and on the 26th of the &s;ame month the Engli&s;h and his party marched to Muxadavat, the capital of Ben|gal, where Colonel Clive placed him in the &s;eat of the Nabobs, and he received homages at Subah of Bengal, Bachar and Orixa. As to Suraja his rival, finding him&s;elf de&s;erted by his officers, he fled from the field of battle, but being taken pri&s;oner, he was put to death, probably by the authority of the conqueror.</P>
<P>Thus, a few Engli&s;h gave a ma&s;ter to one of the riche&s;t, large&s;t, and mo&s;t populous king|doms in the world in about 13 days. The new Nabob thought he could not exceed in his gra|titude to his Briti&s;h friends; he concluded a per|petual alliance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with them; he enlarged the limits and the privileges of their Ea&s;t-India company, and di&s;tributed above 600,000 l. among&s;t their troops and &s;ea|men, paying at the &s;ame time two millions &s;ter|ling, as an indemnification to the Ea&s;t-India company for their lo&s;&s;es at Calcutta. Soon after thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, Admiral Wat&s;on died, through the unwhole|&s;omene&s;s of the climate. The French, to re|trieve &s;o many blows, fitted out a new armament under Mon&s;. d'Ache, who commanded their ma|rine, as did Lally, an officer of rank and expe|rience, the land forces, con&s;i&s;ting of 2000 Eu|ropeans. It is probable the French thought that this great &s;trength would do more than retrieve their affairs in the Ea&s;t-Indies; but they were
<PB N="101" REF="104">
mi&s;taken, for though they took the fort and city of St. David, yet Admiral Pocock, who com|manded the Briti&s;h &s;quadron there, defeated them in two engagements, and cut off their commu|nication between their marine and land troops. The truth is, the French were not only di&s;pirited by their repeated misfortunes, but de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, money, and almo&s;t every thing, ex|cepting men, that could give &s;ucce&s;s to their ope|rations. Many of the Engli&s;h &s;ea officers, on the other hand, mi&s;behaved from very oppo&s;ite motives; they were impatient to enjoy in their own country, the immen&s;e riches they had acquired, and this impatience relaxed their attention to di&s;cipline, &s;o that the Admiral's efforts were &s;ometimes but ill &s;econded by his officers, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome part of the French fleet to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>As to the land troops under Lally, their be|haviour was de&s;picable beyond de&s;cription. Hav|ing no money to carry on his operations, he at fir&s;t demanded a &s;um from an Indian potentate called the King of Tanjour, and his reque&s;t being rejected, he be&s;ieged that Prince's capital, but was driven from it, though it was little better than an open place, through the bravery of &s;ome Engli&s;h gunners. Meeting with this di&s;graceful di&s;appointment, he &s;ought to repair it by &s;eizing a Dutch &s;hip, but with the con&s;ent of the crew, where he found as much money as enabled him to undertake the &s;iege of Madra&s;s or fort St. George. The place was defended by Colonel Draper and Major Brereton with &s;o much &s;pirit and courage, that Lally was obliged to abandon the &s;iege, after lying two months before the place. The remon&s;trances he &s;ent home on this occa&s;ion, will paint the horror and unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind at the cowardice, corruption, and degeneracy of
<PB N="102" REF="105">
tho&s;e he commanded; while the Engli&s;h not only triumphed over him, but reduced the opulent city of Surat, on the we&s;tern penin&s;ula of India. On the 16th of April, 1759, our army took the field under Major Brereton, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf of the important town and fort of Conjive|ram, while Major Ford &s;tormed and took the city of Ma&s;ulipatam. Thus a &s;ea-coa&s;t of 800 miles in extent, along a trading and manufactu|ring country, fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h while the trade of the French was confined to Pon|dicherry, and a few incon&s;iderable places in the neighbourhood. The coa&s;t thus acquired by the Engli&s;h, adjoined to the province of Bengal, out of which the French were entirely driven by Colonel Clive. Tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, however, were &s;omewhat ballanced by a repul&s;e which Major Brereton met with, in attempting to di&s;lodge Lally and his confederates from a &s;trong po&s;t he held under the cannon of a fort. This check, which happened in September, 1759, co&s;t the Engli&s;h between 3 and 400 killed and wounded. Lally, upon this, was preparing to be&s;iege Trichi|napoly, but Colonel Coote, on the 30th of No|vember following, took Wandewa&s;h, one of the mo&s;t important forts on that coa&s;t, in three days time, and made the garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war. Ten days after he took Carangoly, which he obliged the garri&s;on to evacuate. This great &s;ucce&s;s determined Lally to ri&s;k a deci&s;ive engage|ment, or to retake Wandewa&s;h, which he be|&s;ieged with 2200 Europeans, and between 9 and 10,000 blacks. Colonel Coote, however, came up with his army, con&s;i&s;ting of about 17,00 Europeans and 3000 blacks, ju&s;t at the time when Lally was about to &s;torm the breach he had made in the place. A battle en&s;ued, in which the French &s;uffered an entire defeat, with
<PB N="103" REF="106">
the lo&s;s of 1000 killed. In this battle Brigadier Ge|neral Bu&s;&s;y, the Chevalier Godeville, Quarter-ma&s;|ter General, Lieut. Col. Murphy, and 11 inferior officers, were all wounded and made pri&s;oners, and Lally now lo&s;ing all hopes of farther &s;ucce&s;s retired to Pondicherry. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h were 200 killed and wounded, and among&s;t the for|mer was the brave Major Brereton. This victory gave va&s;t credit to the Engli&s;h troops, becau&s;e it was obtained over a General of no &s;mall reputation for his conduct and courage. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t no time in pur&s;uing their victory, for they marched directly again&s;t Chitiput, which they took, and then laid &s;iege to Arcot, the capital of that va&s;t province, on the 5th of February, and it &s;urrendered the 10th, by which about 300 Europeans were made pri&s;o|ners of war.</P>
<P>The &s;ea operations in the Ea&s;t-Indies were pro|&s;ecuted with equal &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s. On the 4th of September, 1759, an engagement happened be|tween M. d'Ache, one of the be&s;t &s;ea officers of France, and Admiral Pocock, in which the former, though he had a great &s;uperiority both in &s;hips and guns, was, after a bloody di&s;pute of two hours, obliged to retire under the walls of Pondicherry. In this engagement, eight of the Engli&s;h &s;hips &s;u&s;tained the fire of the whole French fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting of 16 &s;ail. Of the Engli&s;h, 560 were killed and wounded, and above 1000 of the French. Po|cock, having refitted his &s;hips, &s;ailed for Pondi|cherry, and was there joined by Admiral Corni&s;h. On the 5th of April following, the fortre&s;s of Ca|racal, with &s;everal places of &s;maller importance, were &s;urrendered to the Engli&s;h, and thus the main power of the French in the Ea&s;t-Indies was &s;hut up in Pondicherry.&mdash;We are now to attend the mo&s;t mo|mentous &s;cene that ever pa&s;&s;ed in North America.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h mini&s;try re&s;olved on the reduction of Quebec, the capital of the French empire there. For this great purpo&s;e, the command of the
<PB N="104" REF="107">
land troops, which did not exceed 7000 men, was given to General Wolfe, and that of the &s;ea forces to Admiral Saunders. Sir William John&s;on had taken Niagara, and defeated the French, while General Amher&s;t had been &s;ucce&s;sful upon lake Champlain. About the 26th of July, the Briti&s;h fleet and army, after a pro&s;perous navigation, came before Quebec, and both the General and Admiral made mo&s;t excellent di&s;po&s;itions for reducing it; but they were baffled by the caution of the French General Moncalm, who depended on the &s;trength of the place, and the in&s;urmountable difficulty of the Engli&s;h troops landing to attack it. So well was nature a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, that even Wolfe him&s;elf began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, after being checked and repul&s;ed. At la&s;t, by a train of &s;tratagems, which we have no room to particularize, a landing was effected, but under greater di&s;advantages than any we read of in hi&s;tory; for the Engli&s;h, after landing, were obliged to drag their artillery with them up a &s;teep and dangerous a&s;cent, but gaining the top of the hill, they formed them&s;elves. Mon|calm was now forced to ri&s;k a battle, in which the Engli&s;h were completely victorious, but lo&s;t their brave General Wolfe, who was killed on the field of battle, and his &s;econd in command, General Monckton, being dangerou&s;ly wounded at the &s;ame time, the honour of completing the vic|tory was re&s;erved for General Town&s;hend, who drove the enemy from every po&s;t with the lo&s;s of no more than 500 men, while that of the French amounted to 1500, among&s;t whom was their Ge|neral Moncalm. Five days after, viz. September 18&punc; the city of Quebec &s;urrendered to the Engli&s;h troops.</P>
<P>The great object of the French in America&punc; in the beginning of the year 1760, was the re|taking Quebec. It is certain, that the ob&s;truction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which General Amher&s;t had met with and his no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> being able to give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Engli&s;h at Quebec, was of infinite prejudice to our affairs

there. Be&s;ides the other &s;ervices to which our fleet was appointed, the &s;ea&s;on of the year ren|dered it impo&s;&s;ible for our &s;hips to continue lon|ger there. General Murray had been appointed Governor of that city, and having received all the &s;tores and provi&s;ions that could be &s;pared him, the fleet left him with a garri&s;on compo&s;ed of about 7000 men, who had no other dependance but upon their own courage. The Canadians knew that their troops after the battle of Que|bec had retired to the inland part of the country, where they could not be followed, far le&s;s at|tacked; they &s;aw that not a &s;ingle &s;hip of war had been left to a&s;&s;i&s;t the garri&s;on in ca&s;e of dan|ger, and they were &s;en&s;ible not only that the Engli&s;h were greatly reduced in their numbers by &s;ickne&s;s and other accidents, but that the for|tifications of the city it&s;elf were untenable. With &s;o many inviting appearances, Mon&s;. de Levi, who commanded the French at Canada, was en|couraged to hope that he might be able to recover the city. Had he attempted this by a re&s;olute coup de main, while the river was frozen, it is hard to &s;ay what the con&s;equence might have been. But either through his want of re&s;oluti|on, or being over-awed by Vaudreuil, who was the French Lieutenant-General of Canada, he lo&s;t his opportunity, and having been contented to &s;pend the dead of the winter in &s;kirmi&s;hes, in which he had always the wor&s;t, he re&s;olved to wait for the opening of the &s;pring, when he could form a regular &s;iege, before the place could receive any &s;uccours from the Engli&s;h fleet. Mean while, it is perhaps difficult to account for the rea&s;ons that prevented the garri&s;on from receiving &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from General Amher&s;t. Be that as it will, de Levi having a&s;&s;embled an army of 11 or 12,000 men, took the field on the 17th of
<PB N="106" REF="109">
April, and being well provided with every thing for a &s;iege, he &s;ent his provi&s;ions, ammunition, and heavy baggage down the river St. Lawrence&punc; under the protection of &s;ix frigates from 44 to 26 guns; by which he entirely ma&s;tered the river, and after ten days march, his army appeared up|on the heights of Abraham, within three miles of Quebec.</P>
<P>The danger being pre&s;&s;ing, General Murray had only two things to determine, one was, to &s;tand a &s;iege within the ruined works of Quebec, and the other was to march out and fight the enemy. He cho&s;e the latter, with equal &s;pirit and prudence, as well knowing the &s;uperiority of troops acting on the offen&s;ive, and the great damp that a body of men receives by being &s;hut up within almo&s;t defencele&s;s walls, where they can hope for no relief or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But to his great misfortune he was not able to bring to the field above 3000 men, after leaving a garri&s;on that was but ju&s;t &s;ufficient to over-awe the inhabitants. He re|&s;olved, however, to put every thing to the ri&s;k, as he could depend on the goodne&s;s of the troops he commanded, and accordingly he left the city with 3000 men, and attended by about 20 field pieces. This daring undertaking &s;eems to have &s;truck the enemy with &s;ome &s;urprize. Their troops were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted upon and under &s;ome woody eminences; but before they could put them&s;elves in a regular order of battle, their van, which was po&s;ted upon the eminences, was at|tacked with &s;o much fury by the Engli&s;h, that it was driven in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, and with great lo&s;s, upon the main body, which was drawn up in the valley below, and which was as yet un|broken. As this main body was compo&s;ed of the flower of the French troops in Canada, they formed them&s;elves in columns, and received the
<PB N="107" REF="110">
Briti&s;h troops with &s;o hot a fire, that they were &s;taggered in their pur&s;uit. The French endea|voured to improve the di&s;order by forming them|&s;elves into a kind of &s;emicircle, by which they were in hopes to have enclo&s;ed the flanks of the Engli&s;h army, and even to have cut off its re|treat to Quebec. Nothing but the utmo&s;t intre|pidity on the part of the Engli&s;h could have &s;aved them on this occa&s;ion again&s;t an army that was almo&s;t four times &s;uperior to them in num|bers. Farther re&s;i&s;tance would have been the wor&s;t of madne&s;s, as they had already lo&s;t 1000 men out of the 3000. Their retreat, however, was performed with great order and regularity, nor were they pur&s;ued, and though they were obliged to leave their cannon, they killed about 2000 of the French.</P>
<P>All the flattering pro&s;pects which had been en|tertained in England concerning the conque&s;t of Canada, &s;eemed now to vani&s;h. General Mur|ray, after the defeat before-mentioned, was thought to be irretrievably undone, e&s;pecially as there was no Briti&s;h fleet at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in time; but he was &s;o far from lo&s;ing his &s;pirits that they &s;eemed to be redoubled by his difficulties. He &s;upplied by his activity and diligence the weakne&s;s of the fortifications and army, while the French, &s;en|&s;ible of what importance time was to them, opened trenches before the place the very night of the battle. Here it appeared of how much importance practice is in the art of war, and how little any people can be &s;aid to be &s;elf in&s;tructed as to its operations. The French are thought to have a natural genius for the defence or attack of places; but they were &s;uch aukward engineers before Quebec, that it was the 11th of May before they could bring two batteries to bear upon the place, and even then their fire was mo&s;t mi&s;erably &s;erved.
<PB N="108" REF="111">
This gave the Engli&s;h General farther time to prepare for its defence, and 132 pieces of can|non were mounted upon the ramparts; but this numerous artillery was de&s;titute of hands to ma|nage it, and great part of it mu&s;t have been u&s;e|le&s;s in ca&s;e of a warm attack, which was every day expected; &s;o that con&s;idering the di&s;propor|tion of numbers, it is thought that nothing but the appearance of a Briti&s;h fleet, of which there was little or no likelihood, could &s;ave the place.</P>
<P>At la&s;t on the 9th of May, two days before the batteries were opened, a ve&s;&s;el arrived in the ba|&s;on with an account that Lord Colville, who commanded a &s;mall &s;quadron of Briti&s;h &s;hips at Hallifax, had entered the river St. Lawrence, and would in a few days &s;ail to their relief. On the 15th a &s;hip of the line, and another frigate ar|rived likewi&s;e, and the two frigates, as being fitte&s;t for that &s;ervice, were &s;ent again&s;t the French &s;quadron that lay above the town, which commi&s;&s;ion they executed &s;o completely, that in a few hours the French &s;hips were de&s;troyed, taken, or di&s;per&s;ed. Levi imagined from the manoeuvres of the two frigates, that a &s;trong fleet was at hand to &s;upport them, and upon that pre&s;umption he threw up the game as being lo&s;t, by rai&s;ing the &s;iege with di&s;grace and precipitancy, and leaving behind him all his artillery. The people of England &s;carcely had heard of the danger which Quebec was in, when they re|ceived an account of its being delivered. The tran&s;ition from triumph to con&s;ternation, and from that to joy were &s;o rapid, that the public had no time for condolence, till they had occa|&s;ion for congratulation. Upon the whole, the campaign of Quebec is a reproach both to the courage and conduct of the French, and will be a la&s;ting monument of their inferiority in both

to Britons. They had every thing requi&s;ite that could contribute to a long defence, and a vigo|rous oppo&s;ition. Their &s;ituation was &s;o advan|tageous, they had deemed it impregnable, and neglected to fortify the only pa&s;s by which the Engli&s;h could po&s;&s;ibly fight them with the ap|pearance of equality. Their numbers were &s;u|perior, they fought <HI>pro aris et focis,</HI> in &s;ight of their wives and families, with a town &s;trongly fortified on their &s;ide; they were commanded by a General (Montcalm) whom they had often boa&s;ted to be one of the able&s;t in the world; yet when they came to action, their re&s;i&s;tance was &s;o feeble, that their enemies wi&s;hed they had given them more room for glory, by rendering their victory more difficult. Their behaviour under Levi was &s;till more contemptible. And thus a country, which their own writers had always re|pre&s;ented as being equal in extent to that of the old Roman Empire, fell in a few weeks under the power of his Britannic Maje&s;ty. But we are now to attend the operations of the war in Eu|rope.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1760, the affairs of Europe pre&s;ented them&s;elves with a very unac|countable a&s;pect. The allies under Prince Fer|dinand, without receiving any remarkable check, repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine and the Lippe; he main|taining his ground in the de&s;erts of We&s;tphalia, but abandoning the country of He&s;&s;e, and &s;carcely able to cover Hanover; which the French Gene|ral Broglio, nothwith&s;tanding the advantages he received at Bergen, could not enter. No deci|&s;ive event had followed the victory of Minden, one of the mo&s;t glorious that is to be found in hi&s;tory. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;ituation was equally unaccountable, for, without commit|ting any blunder or mi&s;take in his conduct, he
<PB N="110" REF="113">
now was fallen into di&s;tre&s;s. Tho&s;e con&s;idera|tions created many melancholy reflections in England. The nation &s;aw that the immen&s;e &s;ub|&s;idies which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had received had indeed &s;u&s;pended his fate, but had not given him &s;uperiority. The flattering ideas which we formed of the weakne&s;s of the French, the Au&s;trians and the Ru&s;&s;ians, from their repeated defeats, had deceived us, and it &s;oon appeared that their re&s;ources in men were inexhau&s;tible. The Em|pre&s;s Queen was now obliged to exhert that &s;trength, which &s;he had before &s;pared, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. The territories which were believed to be ruined, while &s;he was re|ceiving the Briti&s;h &s;ub&s;idies, were now found to be rich and flouri&s;hing, both in men and money. Though the court of Peter&s;burgh could not &s;ome years before march a battalion to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Great Britain, nor even put their troops in motion, without being previou&s;ly &s;ub&s;idized, yet, now that the quarrel was their own, they could undertake the mo&s;t tedious and hazardous marches, and fill the plains of Germany with above 100,000 fighting men, and when the&s;e were de|&s;troyed, replace them with as many. Some peo|ple of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank at the Briti&s;h court re|flected with the mo&s;t bitter regret upon tho&s;e matters, and were of opinion that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia could &s;upport him&s;elf without our &s;ub&s;i|dies, as well as his two antagoni&s;ts did.</P>
<P>Whatever were the thoughts of the Briti&s;h patriots upon the &s;ubject, as was before mention|ed, yet they had many rea&s;ons for concealing them. His Maje&s;ty was now grown &s;o venerable in the eyes of the people, that they would have thought it wor&s;e than &s;acrilege to have interrupt|ed his aged hours by an un&s;ea&s;onable, however rational, oppo&s;ition, and it was known that
<PB N="111" REF="114">
the affairs of Germany were always uppermo&s;t in his heart. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Prince Ferdinand, which were rather &s;plendid than &s;olid, had im|pre&s;&s;ed the publick with a high opinion of his martial abilities, and they flattered them&s;elves that every campaign would be deci&s;ive in his favour, if Great Britain continued to &s;upport him. The mini&s;try continued to inforce and improve the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning. And thus very few either within or without doors had the courage to declare their real &s;entiments.</P>
<P>It could not, however, be di&s;gui&s;ed that the weight of the war in Europe lay upon England, tho' &s;he had immediately very little intere&s;t in the event. This con&s;ideration, which was too glaring to be concealed, induced the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try to offer to open a negotiation, but however &s;incere they might be, it is certain that his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty was by no means &s;o when he compiled with it. The two Empre&s;&s;es and France, not to mention Sweden and Poland, tho' they could not flatly reject &s;o plau&s;ible a propo&s;ition, were very little di&s;po&s;ed to accept of it, and threw &s;uch a damp upon all the expedients propo&s;ed by the neutral powers, particularly King Stani&s;laus and the Dutch, that the propo&s;al came to nothing.</P>
<P>The winter of the year 1759 Germany &s;uffered greatly from cold and &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, which drove the poorer &s;ort of the inhabitants into the armies of their &s;everal ma&s;ters; &s;o that tho&s;e of the Empre&s;s Queen were now more numerous than ever. Tho' Great Britain was not afflicted with the like calamities, yet her peo|ple, in their private capacities, &s;hewed a regard for and &s;ent a relief to their troops in Germany and America, that can be matched in no other coun|try. Some private gentlemen formed them&s;elves into a &s;ociety for that purpo&s;e; and in the be|ginning of January, be&s;ides other generous pro|vi&s;ions
<PB N="112" REF="115">
for the widows and orphans of our &s;oldiers, they &s;ent abroad 6000 flannel wai&s;tcoats, 6000 woollen caps, 6000 half gaters, and 5000 pair of woollen gloves; and the donations of the govern|ment were equally liberal. Our army in Germany having &s;uffered greatly in the preceding campaign, fix regiments of foot, commanded by Major Ge|neral Griffin, were &s;ent to reinforce it, and were followed by Elliot's light hor&s;e, &s;o that in the beginning of the campaign, the Briti&s;h troops in Germany amounted to 25,000 men; a greater army of Britons than had ever &s;erved in one place, and at one time, under King William, the great Duke of Marlborough, or indeed under any Engli&s;h General for two centuries before.</P>
<P>The French were equally alert in their en|deavours to make the campaign deci&s;ive. Broglio, who had received a Mar&s;hal's baton of France, continued to command; he had got the &s;uperio|rity over all his antagoni&s;ts, and his army was reinforced to the amount of 100,000 men, the fine&s;t troops in France, while Count de St. Ger|main, with whom he was upon but indifferent terms, was at the head of a &s;eparate body of 30,000 on the Rhine, that no di&s;agreeable effect might ari&s;e from any mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two Generals. Towards the end of January the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el died. His death created many melancholy apprehen&s;ions with re|gard to the future conduct of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, but they were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated; for that Prince, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that lay again&s;t him, exceeded even his father, in his zeal for the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, by adding con&s;iderably to his troops that were in the &s;ervice of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Swedes, who continued to be a party in the war, tho' always un&s;ucce&s;sful, had been ex|tremely
<PB N="113" REF="116">
trouble&s;ome to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. They had &s;uffered but little upon the main, and the people being in general bent on recovering the countries that had been di&s;membred from the crown of Sweden, &s;erved with chearfulne&s;s, tho' under the di&s;advantage of being very ill commanded. The King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, would willingly have appeared to decline any &s;hare in the war, but he was obliged by the Queen of Hungary, and his own family, as well as by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, to &s;uffer a body of Saxons to &s;erve in their armies. The Duke of Meck|lenburgh Schwerin, tho' a Prote&s;tant Prince, en|tered into all the &s;chemes of France and Au&s;tria, for which he was &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, to whom we are now to return.</P>
<P>He had in the beginning of the war boa&s;ted, with great ju&s;tice, that he had &s;even Generals under him, who were not to be parallelled in all Europe; but in a few years all of them were cut, off, without a po&s;&s;ibility of their being replaced; for tho' one genius may &s;ucceed another, yet nothing but practice can &s;upply experience. He however &s;till kept up a creditable appearance, and from time to time publi&s;hed &s;uch accounts of his re&s;ources and troops, as gave the world very high ideas of his power. His &s;ucce&s;&s;es were not an&s;wer|able to tho&s;e reports. He performed prodigies, but he could not act impo&s;&s;ibilities. The Swedes&punc; the French, the Ru&s;&s;ians, and the Au&s;trians were &s;till in the field in the beginning of the year 1760, and tho' &s;ingly they were no match for his troops, yet upon the whole he &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;&s;es by the continued repetition of their attacks. The Swedes invaded the open county of Pomerania; the Ru&s;&s;ians had an eye upon Colberg, becau&s;e it gave them a port in the Baltic, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it would have &s;aved them the march
<PB N="114" REF="117">
of many hundred miles. He had all the exten&s;ive countries of Saxony and Sile&s;ia, which border upon the almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of Bohemia to cover, while the ea&s;tern part of his dominions was next to defencele&s;s. Sile&s;ia is a &s;trong and fertile country, but the manners and maxims of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty are far from being of a conciliat|ing nature to a people, who for many centuries were taught to look upon the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria as their lawful &s;overeigns, &s;o that it may be &s;aid with great truth, that nothing but force can keep them in awe.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of that Prince in the beginning of the year 1760; and a more uncom|fortable one can &s;carcely be conceived. He had nothing but empty fame, and the applau&s;e of news writers, to counterbalance millions of dan|gers and di&s;appointments he was every hour expo&s;|ed to, excepting the immen&s;e &s;ub&s;idy he had from England. It would not perhaps be too bold to &s;ay that this &s;ub&s;idy, every thing con&s;idered, brought upon him all the misfortunes he after|wards met with, becau&s;e he depended too much upon it for the continuance of a war, to which his power was by no means equal. At the time we now treat of he &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat &s;en&s;i|ble of this, for he formed a plan of operations that were entirely defen&s;ive. To give the reader an idea of his &s;ituation, is impo&s;&s;ible, farther than by acquainting him that his brother Prince Henry, commanded an army about Frankfort on the Oder, in order to protect Sile&s;ia, the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and Berlin, which, con&s;idering its importance, is one of the mo&s;t defencele&s;s places in Europe. He him&s;elf in the mean time lay in a camp mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en between the Elbe and the Mulda, in an almo&s;t impregnable &s;ituation, with 250 pieces of can|non
<PB N="115" REF="118">
in his front. The conveniency of this po&s;i|tion was the greater, as he was by it enabled both to receive and &s;end &s;uccours to his brother.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, however, was deceived in all his de&s;igns. The Au&s;trians were &s;uperior to him in force, and almo&s;t equal in di&s;cipline and courage. Laudohn, a General who had hi|therto made but an indifferent figure, was by the policy of the court of Vienna &s;et up as the rival of Count Daun, whom the Empre&s;s Queen con|&s;idered as a great General, but too inactive, too cautious, and too unenterprizing. The character of Laudohn was the rever&s;e. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had placed one of his Generals, Fouquet, in whom he had great confidence, near Glatz, &s;o as to &s;erve as an intermediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either to him&s;elf or to his brother Prince Henry, ac|cording as circum&s;tances &s;hould pre&s;ent them|&s;elves. Laudohn's manoeuvres impo&s;ed upon his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty and all his Generals, and were &s;o my&s;terious, that Fouquet believing his inten|tion was to be&s;iege Schweidnitz, left Glatz un|covered, upon which Laudohn made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Land&s;hut, and Fouquet in a mo&s;t un|&s;oldier-like manner abandoned the protection of Schweidnitz, and marched towards Land&s;hut, from whence he drove the Au&s;trians.</P>
<P>This was what Laudohn had fore&s;een and ex|pected, and in the mean time he &s;ecretly made &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, that Fouquet was in effect &s;ur|rounded without a po&s;&s;ibility of being relieved, while he was obliged to detach 2000 out of the 15,000 men he commanded to pre&s;erve his com|munication with Schweidnitz. It happened at this time that the Au&s;trians were animated with a more than ordinary re&s;entment again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians, nor could all the precautions which Fouquet had taken to fortify his camp with&s;tand
<PB N="116" REF="119">
it. The Au&s;trians knew of the ma&s;terly di&s;po|&s;itions their General had made, and that they mu&s;t depend upon their own courage for &s;ucce&s;s. Their behaviour was equal to their high expecta|tions, and it is hard to &s;ay whether the attack or the re&s;i&s;tance was the mo&s;t glorious, but the Au&s;trians were &s;uperior not only in their numbers but in their condition. The Pru&s;&s;ians had lain long on the defen&s;ive, and had been but poorly &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, and con&s;equently low in &s;pirits. The Au&s;trians, on the other hand, had lived in free quarters, and were in want of nothing that could give them either &s;trength or courage. Notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e di&s;advantages, the Pru&s;&s;ians behaved with admirable re&s;olution, and maintained to the la&s;t every po&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, till they were driven by main force from one en|trenchment to another, and at la&s;t 4000 of them being killed, the remainder, who amounted to almo&s;t 8000, were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war, with 58 pieces of artillery, be&s;ides co|lours, though it was &s;aid the Au&s;trians lo&s;t 12,000 men.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in this war that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who we have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe &s;u|pervi&s;ed the accounts of all his campaigns, found means to exaggerate the lo&s;&s;es of his enemies, and in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree to extenuate his own, &s;o that, candidly &s;peaking, the true &s;tate of his affairs were known only by the con&s;equences. But the defeat of Fouquet could neither be con|cealed nor palliated, and its effects appeared in every department of the war. Laudohn took one part of Glatz by &s;torm and the other by ca|pitulation&punc; though it was defended by 2000 men and above 100 bra&s;s cannon. This, perhaps, was not the greate&s;t lo&s;s. The important &s;itua|tion of the place, and the prodigious magazines
<PB N="117" REF="120">
it contained were irretrievable, and Sile&s;ia was now open to be penetrated by the Au&s;trians.</P>
<P>Thus the city of Glatz was, to the Au&s;trians, the fir&s;t fruits of this complete victory, which, from the place near which it was fought, is called the battle of Land&s;hut. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty knew nothing of the prodigious lo&s;s he had &s;uffered till he had heard that Laudohn was preparing to be&s;iege Bre&s;lau, the capital of Sile&s;ia, and by far too capacious either for its fortifications or garri&s;on. All that he could do was to pur&s;ue a plan like to that of Laudohn, but &s;till more my&s;te|rious, which was &s;ugge&s;ted by his own genius, ever fertile in expedients. All Europe gave him up as lo&s;t, and the di&s;contented in England be|gan, notwith&s;tanding all the public prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, to complain that we had gone too far in &s;upporting him, as his &s;y&s;tem either of offence or defence was equally impracticable, and that our per&s;everence in his cau&s;e would hurt us, without being of any benefit to him.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon undeceived. As it was natu|ral to expect that he would endeavour to retrieve his affairs in Sile&s;ia, the defence of which was his main point, he made preparations for that pur|po&s;e. Daun, who commanded not only his own army but in fact that of the Empire, had not the lea&s;t doubt of his intentions, and leaving Ge|neral Lacy in Saxony, followed his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty through Lu&s;atia. In this march the great fore&s;ight and penetration of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty eminently appeared. Daun's great object was to outmarch him. He had taken the &s;outh road, and the King after pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe and march|ing through a woody country was on the north|ward; &s;o that he had the di&s;advantage of Daun in what we may call their race to Sile&s;ia. Daun

knew this, and availed him&s;elf of his &s;ucce&s;s by accelerating his motions; &s;o that he gained two full days march of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, reached Gorlitz, and proceeded with great rapidity to Lau|ban. This was what his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty ex|pected and wanted; and he had the admirable addre&s;s to appropriate to him&s;elf the advantage of Daun's two days march; for he in&s;tantly fell into the route by which Daun had advanced; and pa&s;|&s;ing the Spree at Bautzen he appeared before the gates of Dre&s;den; &s;o that the war now a&s;&s;umed another a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia though he could not cope with Daun's, the Imperial, and Lucy's army, was &s;uperior to the two latter, &s;o that the fir&s;t was obliged to retreat and the other to change its &s;ituation, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia being joined, according to previous, but eventual, orders, by his Generals Hul&s;on and Ziethen, left Prince Henry, who was at Glogau, at liberty to act as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, while he him&s;elf formed the &s;iege of Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>We are here to ob&s;erve that every plan concerted by the court of Vienna, is, like the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, unalterable, and the devi|ating from it, if not attended with &s;ucce&s;s, be the motives ever &s;o rational, has often proved fa|tal to their Generals. The Empre&s;s Queen to plea&s;e her &s;i&s;ter of Ru&s;&s;ia, and out of mere de|cency, had in&s;tructed Daun in the campaign to make the pre&s;ervation of Dre&s;den his capital ob|ject. He was then in Sile&s;ia, where he dur&s;t not for the rea&s;ons I have given, pur&s;ue his advan|tages; and a&s;toni&s;hed as he was at his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's ma&s;terly conduct, he found him&s;elf, again&s;t his better judgment, obliged to return to Saxony that he might pre&s;erve Dre&s;den; and his return left Prince Henry at Liberty to move to|wards

Sile&s;ia. All the motions of this campaign had hitherto been &s;o &s;kilful, that the reader, who under&s;tands the game at che&s;s, can &s;carcely fail to find out the &s;imilarity. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia made the mo&s;t &s;urprizing and the fine&s;t moves; but Daun &s;hewed him&s;elf to be as &s;ure a player. His return from Sile&s;ia was much more quick than was expected from his phlegm and regula|rity; for on the 19th of July he and his army appeared within a few miles of Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, however, did not fail to avail him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t of the &s;tart he had gained. He be&s;ieged Dre&s;den, which was de|fended by General Maguire. The operations of the &s;iege, unle&s;s we were to recount particulars, can convoy no new in&s;truction to a reader who can form an idea of the mo&s;t determined attack on the one &s;ide, and the mo&s;t intrepid defence on the other; and the ruin of the fine&s;t buildings that any city in the world contained, by the in|ce&s;&s;ant fire from three batteries of cannons and mortars; while each party equally practi&s;ed every art and manoeuvre u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es. The ap|proach of Count Daun &s;erved to redouble the fury of the Pru&s;&s;ians, but at the &s;ame it confirmed and encrea&s;ed the re&s;olute intrepidity of the be|&s;ieged, e&s;pecially when Daun found means, as he did, to throw into the place 16 battalions during the night of the 21&s;t. After &s;uch a reinforce|ment, and while three armies were in the neigh|hood (for the army of the Empire and that under Lacy had returned by this time) it would have been wor&s;e than madne&s;s for his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty to continue the &s;iege, and therefore he rai&s;ed it, but without mole&s;tation from his enemies. Thus ended this mighty trial of &s;kill between great genius and great &s;agacity, and each &s;upported by a proportionable degree of courage and experi|ence;
<PB N="120" REF="123">
&s;o that on the whole we may allow the conduct of the Pru&s;&s;ians was the mo&s;t brilliant, and that of the Au&s;trians the mo&s;t &s;olid; but in the main, if any advantage was gained, it lay on the King's &s;ide, though in fact the great game that was played between them remained &s;till pre|carious.</P>
<P>Laudohn, who was all this while in Sile&s;ia, tru&s;ted to his being joined by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ians, but through their unwieldine&s;s and irregularity they did not arrive &s;oon enough to make the campaign deci&s;ive on that &s;ide. Being &s;till, however, in hopes of their junction, on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t he had his cannon and mortars in condition to play from their batteries upon Bre&s;lau. Count Tauenzein commanded for his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty in that city, and a kind of military ceremonial at fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between the two Generals. Laudohn partly in civility, partly in compa&s;&s;ion, took pity upon Tauenzien's weakne&s;s and that of the place, and employed various arguments, which had more the air of a French than a German General, to per&s;uade him to accept of an honourable capitu|lation. Tauenzien was too ob&s;tinate and too un|polite to believe one word he &s;aid, and thus after they had fought through all the weapons of &s;ol|dier-like courte&s;y they drew the &s;word, and no|thing was wanting that could do honour to the be&s;ieged or the be&s;iegers. For a relation of what pa&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion we mu&s;t refer our readers to what we have ju&s;t now &s;aid concerning the &s;iege of Dre&s;den. Laudohn from ho&s;tilities re|turned to compliments, and was an&s;wered only by reproaches for doing the &s;ame thing again&s;t Bre&s;lau that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was doing again&s;t Dre&s;den, that is ruining the town with|out damaging the fortifications. Mean while there was no account of the approach of the
<PB N="121" REF="124">
Ru&s;&s;ians, but on the 5th of Augu&s;t an account came that Prince Henry was within a few miles of the Au&s;trian camp, which induced Laudohn in a kind of a regular hurry to break up the &s;iege.</P>
<P>A philo&s;ophical reader (if any &s;uch I have) will here make a pau&s;e and reflect on the extreme folly and cruelty of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t hu|mane Generals. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty avows him&s;elf to be a philo&s;opher, and therefore he may be &s;aid to be a profe&s;&s;or of humanity. Count Daun is remarkable for coolne&s;s, placability, and his not having the lea&s;t tincture of har&s;hne&s;s in his temper, even to his enemies. Yet what de|va&s;tations, what blood&s;hed and what inhumani|ties did not each of them this campaign commit, without either of them bettering his &s;ituation! The reader will pardon this reflection, which may not &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf during the piece-meal read|ing of news papers, but appears in full force, when, as in the&s;e pages, they are brought into one point of view.</P>
<P>The operations between the French and the allies this campaign were far from an&s;wering the great preparations and reinforcements which both &s;ides had made and received. The truth is, at the opening of the campaign the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of both armies was to eat rather than to fight, and all the motions of all their parties were to|wards getting a meal rather than a victory. The winter had been &s;evere, the country con&s;umed, and the &s;pring late; calamities that were in com|mon to both, and each had a kind of fellow feel|ing for the other. The reader mu&s;t have a per|&s;onal view of the country before he can judge of the &s;ituations of the allies, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, the great, and indeed the &s;ole dependence of their army. When the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on abated,
<PB N="122" REF="125">
the &s;uperior providence of the French over our German commander appeared, for, while they lay in their cantonments, they were &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions from the Rhine, the Mayne, and the Mo&s;elle, while the allies were di&s;abled by want and indigence to undertake any enterprize that was worthy the immen&s;e expence to Great Bri|tain at which they were &s;erving. All that is worth mentioning was performed by the young hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, who laid Fulda under contribution, and expelled the French from it at the head of &s;ome Briti&s;h troops. Happily for the allies, a mi&s;under&s;tanding prevailed be|tween the two French Generals, Mar&s;hal Brog|lio and Count de St. Germain. In&s;tead of the one advancing by Mun&s;ter and the other through the Landgraviate of He&s;&s;e, and leaving &s;trong po&s;ts to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, operations that might have proved fatal to the allies, the whole of their grand army united into one body; a mea&s;ure &s;o di&s;cordant with the original and in|deed rational plan of their operations, that St. Germain, who is &s;aid to have the true&s;t military genius of any French officer, was di&s;gu&s;ted, but, at fir&s;t, without retiring from his command. Not|with&s;tanding this, the French took Marburg and Dillenburg, the fir&s;t on the 30th of June, the latter on the 16th of July, and made the garri|&s;ons of both pri&s;oners of war. The inactivity of the German General in this perillous &s;ituation is a little unaccountable, but the hereditary Prince, at the head of &s;ome Briti&s;h regiments, endea|voured to retrieve it. The French had hitherto moved in two bodies, and that under St. Ger|main was known to have advanced to Corbach, &s;o that the Prince re&s;olved to attack him, and to drive him from that po&s;t. But by this time the junction of the French was formed, and the
<PB N="123" REF="126">
Prince in&s;tead of encountring 10,000 foot and 17 &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, which were the number St. Germain commanded, fell in with the whole French army, and that too with &s;uch re&s;olution, as rendered his retreat, after he had di&s;covered his mi&s;take, almo&s;t impracticable. Nothing but the valour of the Engli&s;h could have remedied this mi&s;take. The French were fre&s;h, numerous, and well formed. The Germans, both hor&s;e and foot, gave them&s;elves up to a de&s;pondency (to call it no wor&s;e) which threatened a total rout, while the French were every moment pouring in reinforcements, chiefly of cavalry, to complete their de&s;truction. In this de&s;perate &s;ituation the Prince put him&s;elf at the head of Bland's and Howard's dragoons, who &s;oon check|ed the ardour of the French cavalry, covered the retreat of the Germans, and thus &s;aved the army at the expence of 900 men killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oners, and 15 pieces of cannon, which were left in the field of battle, be&s;ides a wound which his Serene Highne&s;s him&s;elf received.</P>
<P>The allies, during the action as was before mentioned, after retreating towards the Dymel, were encamped at Saxenhau&s;en. Military men were amazed that Broglio did not pur&s;ue his ad|vantage, nor can the rea&s;ons of his inactivity be, to this day, accounted for. The Hereditary Prince unju&s;tly charged him&s;elf with being the author of a defeat, which did him and the Engli&s;h &s;o much honour, and formed a daring re&s;olution to repair it. He knew that Glaubitz, a French General, was at the head of a con&s;idera|ble detachment, which were marched towards Zegenhagen in He&s;&s;e, to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that important po&s;t. For this purpo&s;e his Serene Highne&s;s put him&s;elf at the head of &s;ix German battalions, two brigades of hunters, a regiment
<PB N="124" REF="127">
of Hu&s;&s;ars, and Elliot's regiment of light hor&s;e. The la&s;t regiment had been rai&s;ed only in the preceeding &s;pring and winter, and had been form|ed chiefly out of Engli&s;h journeymen, who rather cho&s;e to &s;erve in the army than &s;ubmit to, what they called, the unju&s;t demands of their ma&s;ters. Not a man among&s;t them had ever been before in the &s;ervice, but they liked it &s;o well that they were &s;oon di&s;ciplined, and made an excellent ap|pearance, &s;o that the Hereditary Prince cho&s;e them to form part of his detachment. He was at this time above 60 Engli&s;h miles di&s;tant from Glaubitz, which rendered the latter perfectly &s;ecure. The Prince, however, led his detach|ment, unperceived, within &s;ight of his camp, and after reconnoitring it, he formed the plan of the attack, which was of a very extraordinary nature. The &s;ituation of the enemy was &s;uch as to be inacce&s;&s;ible on their left, but by making a detour of two leagues through woody uneven grounds, and the right was &s;ecured by mountains. The Hereditary Prince undertook in per&s;on the at|tack of the left. He left that of the right to his infantry, who were obliged to climb up moun|tains, to come at their enemy. Both charges were &s;o vigorous and &s;o unexpected, that both &s;ucceeded. The enemy in a manner was routed before Glaubitz had time to form them; but they were routed with very little lo&s;s, and the advantage of their &s;ituation was &s;uch that their main body retired from one wood to another, while the Prince was unable to bring up his fatigued and harra&s;&s;ed infantry to the pur&s;uit. It was on this occa&s;ion, that Elliot's hor&s;e per|formed &s;ervices that would have done honour to a regiment of the be&s;t veterans in Europe. The Prince in per&s;on led them on, and they alone entered the wood, where their addre&s;s and di&s;cipline
<PB N="125" REF="128">
was equal to their intrepidity. The enemy unable to re&s;i&s;t them were charged and penetrated five times; by which a party of 500, being &s;eparated from the re&s;t, threw down their arms and &s;urren|dered them&s;elves pri&s;oners. A great deal, howe|ver, remained &s;till to be done before the victory could be complete. A regiment of the enemy's hu&s;&s;ars was entirely cut in pieces; and the main body, which had taken po&s;t in the wood, being in like manner &s;urrounded, found them&s;elves likewi&s;e obliged to give up their arms, but not till after a great &s;laughter. The pri&s;oners made on this occa&s;ion, be&s;ides Glaubitz him&s;elf and a Prince of Anhalt, were 177 officers, and 2482 private men, nine pair of colours and &s;ix pieces of cannon were taken; &s;o that upon the whole it was with regard to the captures, one of the mo&s;t extraordinary actions ever known. The Hereditary Prince lo&s;t no more than 79 men, but, of tho&s;e, 71 were Elliot's light hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand remained all this time in his camp at Saxenhau&s;en, but after this action he moved to Kalle near Ca&s;&s;el. Upon this, the French, who were very numerous, divided them|&s;elves into three armies. One of them, which had formed their re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of 35000 men, pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel at Stalbergen under the Chevalier de Muy, who had &s;ucceeded St. Ger|main in his command; another body, which was their main army, advanced under Broglio him&s;elf to Kalle; and the third, under Prince Xavier of Saxony, took the route of Ca&s;&s;el. From tho&s;e motions it was plain the French Generals meditated &s;ome important blow, and Prince Ferdinand at all events thought it his be&s;t cour&s;e to pa&s;s the Dymel and fight de Muy. On the 31&s;t of July, the allies, having pa&s;&s;ed the river, and formed upon the heights of Corbach,
<PB N="126" REF="129">
came in &s;ight of the French, who were po&s;ted to great advantage at Warbourg. It would be pre|&s;umptuous in us to cen&s;ure the operations of great Generals, but we cannot help being of opinion, that &s;omething was wanting to &s;upport the attack made on this occa&s;ion. The Hereditary Prince turned the left of the enemy in two columns, &s;o as to attack them in flank and rear with his u&s;ual bri&s;kne&s;s; but the French were &s;o well reinforced that he could do nothing effectual. In the mean while, Prince Ferdinand ordered &s;ome detachments to attack the French bridges over the Dymel to the right, and he him&s;elf ad|vanced to charge the enemy in front. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, had they been properly &s;upported, mu&s;t have been deci&s;ive in favour of the allies; but the flower of their army, which con&s;i&s;ted of the Engli&s;h, were five miles behind, &s;o that tho' the French, by the efforts of the Hereditary Prince, began to give way on that &s;ide, yet their main body was at liberty to retire, without putting it into the power of the infantry of the allies to engage them, nor indeed did their commander in chief &s;eem to have been very forward to ri&s;k his Ger|man troops. By his own account &s;ent to his late Maje&s;ty, it is certain, that his attack upon the enemy's front was very feeble, and as he him&s;elf acknowledges, was un&s;upported by the infantry, &s;o that the heat of the day fell upon the Engli&s;h, who&s;e cavalry came all the five miles upon a full trot under the Marquis of Granby and Generals Mo&s;tyn, and while General Waldegrave did all he could to ha&s;ten the march of the infantry, Captain Philips brought up the Briti&s;h arrillery on a gallop. But tho' our na|tional troops were thus beyond all precedent ex|peditions, yet they could not prevent the enemy
<PB N="127" REF="130">
from making their retreat good over the Dymel. The charge, that was made upon them by the Briti&s;h cavalry, was &s;o gallant, as to evince their ardour for retrieving that glory which they had been deprived of at Minden, tho' their foot, many of whom dropt down in the mora&s;&s;es, through which their long fatiguing march lay, could not &s;econd them. The French, in their account, pretend, that the brigade of Bourbon checked the Briti&s;h cavalry, that the allies were greatly &s;uperior in number, that the Hereditary Prince in turning their left was favoured by a fog, and that the battle continued without ad|vantage to either &s;ide four hours. But it is evi|dent, even from their own narrative, that they employed mo&s;t of that time in making preparations for a retreat, which with great difficulty they effected over the Dymel, and that, upon the whole, they thought them&s;elves victorious, becau&s;e they were not completely defeated. In this battle, the great lo&s;s fell upon the Engli&s;h, of whom about 600 were killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing. But the total lo&s;s of the allied army was not pub|li&s;hed, probably becau&s;e it would have di&s;covered the great di&s;proportion between the &s;ufferings of the Engli&s;h and tho&s;e of the Germans. The French in their account pretended, that the lo&s;s of the allies were &s;uperior to theirs. But that could not be the fact. Be&s;ides great numbers of French that were drowned in pa&s;&s;ing the Dymel, 1500 were left dead on the field of battle, and as many were taken, together with ten pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>The battle of Warbourg, the reader will per|ceive, was more glorious than it was advantage|ous to the Engli&s;h and their allies. The Cheva|lier de Muy commanded but one of the three French armies; but the other two, without re|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="128" REF="131">
became ma&s;ters of Munden, Ca&s;&s;el, Gottingen, Eimbach, and Ziegenhagen, where they made a great number of pri&s;oners, and got con&s;iderable magazines. Thus, though the allies gained a battle, they lo&s;t a province, the whole Landgraviate of He&s;&s;e being now in the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; nor was it clear, that, before the end of the campaign, they might not become ma&s;ters of Hanover it&s;elf; while all that Prince Ferdi|nand gained was to &s;ecure his po&s;ts upon the Dy|mel, and pre&s;erve his communication with We&s;t|phalia, the lo&s;s of which mu&s;t have been of the wor&s;t con&s;equence to him, con&s;idering the &s;itua|tion of the two armies. The abilities of the German General on this occa&s;ion were highly extolled; but, perhaps, the pre&s;ervation of Ha|nover was owing chiefly to its mi&s;erable exhau&s;ted &s;tate, which rendered it incapable of maintain|ing an army.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, all this while, had the ter|rible junction of the Ru&s;&s;ians with the Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts hanging over his head. One body of the former had already entered the fron|tiers of Sile&s;ia, another had penetrated into Po|merania, where they prepared to lay &s;iege to Colberg, and the whole of them had laid under contribution va&s;t tracts of his Maje&s;ty's be&s;t pro|vinces. Laudohn &s;till continued the blockade of Nei&s;s and Schweidnitz, his army was powerful, and 22,000 Swedes had begun their operations, while his Maje&s;ty's main enemy Daun was lying in wait for an opportunity to fini&s;h all his hopes. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty in this di&s;tracted and di&s;|couraging &s;ituation had recour&s;e to expedients, which nece&s;&s;ity alone can &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;ucce&s;s ju&s;tify. Mar&s;hal Daun was then at Bautzen, without dreaming that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty would undertake impo&s;&s;ibilities, for &s;o they mu&s;t be
<PB N="129" REF="132">
thought by all the known rules of war-making. The King, finding he could effect nothing in Saxony, on the 30th of July decamped and took the rout of Mei&s;&s;en, and without our tracing his various motions, in five days time he marched near 200 miles, at the head of an army encum|bered with a numerous artillery and 2000 wag|gons, and he pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe, the Spree, the Nei&s;s, the Quei&s;s, and the Boher, with one Au&s;trian army on one &s;ide of him under General Reid, near Bautzen, another behind him under General La&s;cy, and a third in front, under General Beck; and all this without oppo&s;ition. After this a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, it may, perhaps be unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that during his progre&s;s he obtained many, not incon&s;iderable, advantages over the Au&s;trian Ge|nerals.</P>
<P>In an undertaking like this, it is proper not only to recount the facts, but to ob&s;erve what we may call the military <HI>rationale</HI> of great events. Count Daun, as we have mentioned, was &s;till at Bautzen, with an intention to penetrate into Sile&s;ia, and to join Laudohn, in which ca&s;e, the often attempted junction of the Au&s;trians with the Ru&s;&s;ians, mu&s;t have been effected. Laudohn, who&s;e army was every day receiving &s;trong rein|forcements, had been, for &s;ome time, with difficul|ty, kept in play by Prince Henry; but the delay of a few days mu&s;t have rendered the match un|equal, as the Ru&s;&s;ians were every hour advancing. Daun was a&s;toni&s;hed at the e&s;cape, for &s;o we may call it, of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, but prepared to follow him. His Maje&s;ty encamped at Lignitz, but found him&s;elf in danger, after all, of mi&s;&s;ing his great aim, which was that of engaging Lau|dohn before the armies under Daun and La&s;cy could arrive to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they did be|fore his Maje&s;ty could find that opportunity. But
<PB N="130" REF="133">
&s;till Daun and Laudohn occupied different camps, the one on his front, and the other on his rear. They had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an extent of a very &s;trong country, no le&s;s than 30 miles, along the Kat&s;|bach, from Parchwitz to Co&s;&s;endan, and had filled it with lines and redoubts, &s;o that the whole appeared as one continued fortification, nor could his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, with all his &s;kill, fall upon a way of attacking one army without being expo&s;ed to be ruined by the other. He was again in one of tho&s;e &s;ituations that had &s;o often di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him. It is unknown to the public, whether he owed his deliverance on this occa&s;ion to his own wonderful &s;agacity, which &s;ugge&s;ted what he him&s;elf would do, had he the &s;ame ad|vantages, or whether he was not favoured by pri|vate intelligence. Both might be true. Daun was tempted by the occa&s;ion which pre&s;ented it|&s;elf, and re&s;olved to become the aggre&s;&s;or. He concerted a plan with Laudohn and La&s;cy for attacking his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, while the Ru&s;|&s;ians, to the number of 24,000 men, having thrown bridges over the Oder, were to pa&s;s it that very day under Count Czernichew. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;aw that his enemies could not &s;urround him, without their making one of tho&s;e movements he had &s;o long wi&s;hed for. On the very night, when the Au&s;trians had propo&s;ed their great &s;troke, he privately decamped from Lignitz, and removed to a &s;trong pa&s;s by which he knew Laudohn's divi&s;ion mu&s;t march.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. Daun exe|cuted his part of the plan with profound &s;ilence in the night time, but found the enemy decamped, and &s;oon had certain indications that they were en|gaged with Laudohn. It was thought, at his own court e&s;pecially, that if he had made a vigo|rous attack on the rear of the Pru&s;&s;ian army it
<PB N="131" REF="134">
might have been totally defeated. But this opi|nion probably did him inju&s;tice, for his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty fore&s;eeing &s;uch an attack, had guarded his rear with very &s;trong entrenchments. In the mean while, Laudohn had pa&s;&s;ed the Kat&s;bach, and proceeded as far as P&s;affendorf in his march to Lignitz, where he was in hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the mortal blow his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was to re|ceive. The break of day-light, and the di&s;|&s;ipation of a very thick fog, pre&s;ented to his eves a mo&s;t dreadful pro&s;pect, which was that of the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army drawn up in array of battle, with a &s;trong artillery on its front, and po&s;ted to great advantage. This was the morn|ing of the 15th of Augu&s;t, but the a&s;toni&s;hment of Laudohn neither daunted his courage, nor di&s;|ordered his judgment. Finding he could not re|treat, he formed his army with admirable pre|&s;ence of mind, and a mo&s;t terrible battle en&s;ued, in which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty in per&s;on was ex|po&s;ed equally with the meane&s;t &s;oldier; his cloaths being &s;hot through in &s;everal places, and a hor&s;e killed under him; &s;o that it might be &s;aid he then fought not for dominion but &s;afety. Nothing, perhaps, but his own per&s;onal intrepidity could have gained him the victory. His veteran Generals were all dead or killed, and his troops were but newly rai&s;ed; but they were brave and faithful. His example in&s;pirited their efforts, and Laudohn, without lo&s;ing any of his military reputation, retreated to the Kat&s;bach with the lo&s;s (as to the Au&s;trians them&s;elves gave out) of 6000 men killed, wounded and taken pri&s;oners, though the Pru&s;&s;ians gave out he lo&s;t 10,000. Two Ge|nerals and 84 officers were among&s;t the pri&s;oners, and the trophies which fell to the victors were 82 pieces of cannon, and 123 pair of colours. The
<PB N="132" REF="135">
lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians was &s;aid to have been 5000 killed and 1200 wounded.</P>
<P>Though the lo&s;s of the battle, as has been before hinted, mu&s;t have been fatal to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, it did not prove &s;o to the Au&s;trians, who&s;e Generals received daily rein|forcements, and encouragements from their So|vereign. Daun, though he could not &s;ucceed in Sile&s;ia, turned his arms towards other objects. He detached Prince Laven&s;tein and General Beck, with part of his army, to encourage the Ru&s;&s;ians to advance. But the terror of the battle of P&s;affendorf, had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon them, that they had repa&s;&s;ed the Oder, and were then marching Northwards. This did not hin|der Daun from blockading Schweidnitz, and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty having, by this time, joined his brother at Newmarche, detached General Goltze to ob&s;erve the motions of the Ru&s;&s;ians, while he him&s;elf defeated the corps of Au&s;trians under General Beck, and obliged Daun to rai&s;e the blockade of Schweidnitz, and to retreat precipi|tately towards the heights of Land&s;hut. In Saxony, General Hul&s;en, on the 20th of Augu&s;t, had an action with part of the Imperial army, which attacked him with great fury, in order to cut off his communication with Torgau. The engagement was hot, and Hul&s;en di&s;covered great military abilities, for, be&s;ides the killed, he made 41 officers and 1200 men pri&s;oners, with very little lo&s;s to him&s;elf. But he could not avail him&s;elf of this victory; for he was obliged to retreat, lea&s;t the grand army of the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould cut off his communication with the Elbe. By this retreat he lo&s;t his communication with the King, who&s;e mind and army was di&s;tracted amid&s;t a variety of objects. The Ru&s;&s;ians were now marching through the Lower Sile&s;ia. The Au|&s;trians
<PB N="133" REF="136">
found no re&s;i&s;tance in Lu&s;atia, and Saxony, notwith&s;tanding all Hul&s;en could do to defend it, was upon the point of being lo&s;t to the King. Such was the &s;tate of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's affairs towards the clo&s;e of the campaign. He had defeated his enemies, without finding he had le&s;&s;en'd their numbers. He had gained victories, but had reaped no advantages, and all the pro|digies of valour he had performed, did no more than ju&s;t &s;ave him from perdition. But the &s;itua|tion of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's mind is be&s;t de&s;|cribed in the following letter, which he wrote to the Marquis D'Argens, the author of the Jewi&s;h Spy, and one of his literary favourites, which letter bears in its &s;tile and compo&s;ition undoubted marks of its authenticity, which was verified by other inconte&s;tible evidence.</P>

<P>Some of the belligerant powers at la&s;t began to reflect, with horror, upon the dreadful butchery their armies were committing in Germany, where they had no original, or immediate, concern. The French had attacked, as we have already ob|&s;erved, his Britannic Maje&s;ty's electoral domini|ons, only in con&s;equence of their American quarrel. Great Britain was only con&s;equentially and out of gratitude engaged to protect them, and yet their two armies had acted with the &s;ame &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;itions, as if they had been princi|pals in fighting <HI>pro aris et focis.</HI> The Ru&s;&s;ians could at be&s;t be con&s;idered as auxiliaries to the Empre&s;s Queen, yet their deva&s;tations in Ger|many exceeded tho&s;e of all the other powers; and the Swedes, though impotent, were &s;till numerous enough to make head again&s;t the piti|ful number which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had to op|po&s;e them, and to eat up the unhappy country. None of tho&s;e pacific &s;entiments, however, were publickly avowed by any party, but they &s;eem to have been manife&s;ted by their con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="139">
The public of England were every day in ex|pectation, that after the French had made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of Munden and Gottingen, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> would have penetrated into Hanover, which they might ea&s;ily have done. But they had many rea&s;ons for declining &s;uch a &s;tep. In the fir&s;t place, as we have already hinted, the country was &s;o exhau&s;ted, that it could not have maintained them. In the next, &s;uch an attempt, if &s;ucce&s;sful, was incon|&s;i&s;tent with their real plan. The Briti&s;h parlia|ment began already to be unea&s;y about the wa&s;te of their blood and trea&s;ure in Germany; and had Hanover been completely conquered, no pretext could have been invented for detaining their ar|my there, which was the great point France had in view. A remarkable langui&s;hment, however, followed it, between the two armies who were encamped on each &s;ide of the Dymel, after the battle of Warbourg, for a whole month. This in|action was di&s;agreeable to the genius of the Here|ditary Prince, who appears to have made war in <HI>earne&s;t,</HI> without any lucrative views of continu|ing his appointments, or the mean ones of &s;par|ing his Germans. It is true, the great opinion he experimentally entertained of the Briti&s;h valour co&s;t our countrymen dear, and was favourable to the Germans, but he always ventured his own per|&s;on equally with that of the meane&s;t Engli&s;h &s;oldier, and they followed him with pride and alacrity. While the armies lay in this &s;tate of inaction, he under&s;tood that 2000 French occupied the town of Zierenberg, and he re&s;olved to &s;urprize them. He accordingly po&s;ted a body of troops between that place and Dierenberg, to cut off all commu|nication between the two camps of the enemy. He next made the proper di&s;po&s;itions for &s;ecure|ing his retreat, in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e; and at the head of his remaining foot, mo&s;t of which were
<PB N="137" REF="140">
Engli&s;h, on the 5th of September, they &s;et out in three divi&s;ions for Warbourg, and by two next morning they were before Zierenberg. But not|with&s;tanding all the precautions that had been taken for the &s;ilence of their march, they were di&s;covered by a party of dragoons, who fired upon them and &s;pread an alarm. On this occa&s;ion, the intrepidity and good di&s;cipline of the Engli&s;h foot did them great honour. Contrary to the u&s;ual character of their nation, of being too ready to fire, they made u&s;e of their bayonets only. With them they drove the enemy's picquets, who were on their guard, before them; &s;ome entered the town at the &s;ame time with the fugitives, others were employed in putting the guard to the &s;word, and others in forcing open the gates, till at la&s;t, all entered the place, and, without firing, they proceeded in firm order to the church-yard, which the main body of the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The noi&s;e they made was &s;o little, and the night &s;o dark, that the French took them to be their own picquets, and &s;uffered them to draw up near them, but they were attacked and totally di&s;|per&s;ed by the Engli&s;h with their bayonets on their mu&s;quets. In vain the French attempted to fly from the gate. They were every where oppo&s;ed, pur&s;ued, &s;lain, or taken pri&s;oners. Every quar|ter of the town was filled with blood, confu&s;ion, and tumult, but the Engli&s;h were victorious thro' all. They neither killed nor took pri&s;oners any of the inhabitants who had not weapons in their hands, and far from being intent on plunder, they even refu&s;ed to accept of the gratuities which the town&s;men offered them to &s;pare their per&s;ons and properties. The whole action of this noble and well conducted expedition la&s;ted but about an hour, at the end of which, the Prince found him|&s;elf in complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, having
<PB N="138" REF="141">
taken two pieces of cannon, and made 36 officers and near 500 private men pri&s;oners. He then con&s;idered the danger of remaining with &s;o &s;mall a force, &s;o near the enemy's main body, and re|gained his former camp without lo&s;s or mole&s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>Here we find it again nece&s;&s;ary to interrupt the cour&s;e of this narrative, by ob&s;erving, that the intrepidity which the Engli&s;h uniformly di&s;|played, and the &s;ucce&s;s which attended all their operations during the cour&s;e of this war, com|pared with the little effect produced by &s;uch ama|zing exertions of courage, &s;ufficiently prove, that there was &s;omewhat ami&s;s, and too dilatory in the original plan of every campaign, which no valour or partial &s;ucce&s;s could remedy. The ad|vantage gained at Zierenberg was glorious and cheap, for it co&s;t them no more than 10 men, and yet, if we except the reputation the Engli&s;h gained by it, it was dear when we con&s;ider its con&s;equences. The gallant Prince found, as he might ea&s;ily have fore&s;een, that he could not keep the place, and by quitting it, he lo&s;t all he had obtained, excepting a few pri&s;oners, who were burden&s;ome to maintain. The public, however, had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee Prince Ferdinand put his Germans in motion, in order to attempt to interrupt the communication between the French and the Rhine, and the Mayne e&s;pecially with Franckfort. As to Hanover, it lay quite neglected by both parties. The French had their rea&s;ons, as we have already &s;een, for not penetrating fur|ther into it than Gottingen, and the allies pre|tended that they could not, without hazarding the intire lo&s;s of their army, attempt to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them either of that city or of Ca&s;&s;el. Bulow, a Hanoverian General, was di&s;patched with a &s;trong detachment to make inroads into Wetteravia,
<PB N="139" REF="142">
and the &s;outhern parts of He&s;&s;e, which he did with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that he pu&s;hed on towards Marbourg, which town he &s;urprized, and de|&s;troyed in it the French ovens with con&s;iderable magazines of provi&s;ions, be&s;ides carrying off their cloathing and military &s;tores. He at la&s;t proceeded towards Frankenau. The French all this while beheld his progre&s;s with an air of &s;e|curity, as thinking it was always in their power to check him. The matter became now to be &s;e|rious, as they began to feel &s;ome inconveniences in their communication with Franckfort. Stain|ville, one of their be&s;t Generals, on the 13th of September, attacked the rear of Bulow's detach|ment as it was pa&s;&s;ing the river Orck, and not only defeated it, but in all probability would have cut off the whole body, had not the active He|reditary Prince, hearing of his danger, made a forced march of five German miles, and arrived to his relief. This obliged Stainville to retire to a &s;trong camp, where he could not be attacked with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. In the mean while, a feeble effort was made under General Wangenheim, another of the allied Generals, to force the enemy to abandon Gottingen, but on the 19th of September, after he had pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, he was obliged to repa&s;s it with very con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and not quite to the advantage of his military character. It mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that in all tho&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes and expediti|ons, the French &s;hewed a vigilance and an atten|tion to their plan of operations, far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the allies; who either had concerted none that was regular, or were entirely directed by the motions of their enemy. The latter, on the 20th of September, in con&s;equence of their defen&s;ive &s;cheme, retired towards Ca&s;&s;el, where they fortified them&s;elves, while Prince Ferdi|nand
<PB N="140" REF="143">
ventured to do nothing, but to advance &s;o near them as to ob&s;erve their operations.</P>
<P>More active, and indeed unexpected &s;cenes of war pre&s;ented them&s;elves upon the Rhine, and almo&s;t on the frontiers of the dominions of the States Generals, where the Hereditary Prince appeared to the &s;urprize of all Europe, who thought he had been in the further part of He&s;&s;e. It would exceed our propo&s;ed bounds, &s;hould we de&s;cribe the particulars, by which this emergen|cy, as we may call it, was effected. It is &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay, that he had under him 20 battali|ons and 10 &s;quadrons, which he divided into two bodies. One of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Roe|root, on the other &s;ide Du&s;&s;eldorp. The other divi&s;ion, which marched by the way of Mun&s;ter, pa&s;&s;ed a great way below at Rees, which lies al|mo&s;t half way between Cleves and We&s;el. Tho&s;e two detachments, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tance of the places, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine about the &s;ame time, and their manoeuvres were conducted &s;o, as, in a manner to clo&s;e upon the French. Every thing &s;ucceeded as had been projected. As they advanced to their intended junction, all the French po&s;ts along the Rhine, with all other boats, fell into the Prince's hands, by which he was enabled to carry over his artillery and the whole of his troops; &s;o that meeting with no oppo&s;ition, his detachment again &s;eparated, and on the 3d of October, one divi&s;ion took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cleves, and three days after, of its ca&s;tle with 500 men; while another laid &s;iege to We&s;el and attacked it with great fury.</P>
<P>The rapid &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition did not prevent its giving ri&s;e to many conjectures, and &s;ome cen&s;ures, with regard to its utility to Great Britain. Mo&s;t people thought that it had been formed to favour, in conjunction with a &s;trong
<PB N="141" REF="144">
armament which was fitted out at Port&s;mouth, a powerful diver&s;ion on the &s;ide of the Au&s;trian Netherlands, which might have obliged the French to de&s;i&s;t from forming an army on the Lower Rhine, by which Broglio mu&s;t have be|come ma&s;ter of Hanover. But this &s;uppo&s;ition was chimerical. Hanover had, at this time, in fact, nothing to fear, for, as we have often hinted, Broglio might have become ma&s;ter of it when he plea&s;ed. We are therefore to look el&s;e|where for the motives of this famous expedition.</P>
<P>It is certain, that is was not difficult to fore&s;ee there would be great cla&s;hings in the court of Great Britain, concerning the va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure in which &s;he was involved by the German war. Of all the lo&s;&s;es his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had met with, that of his countries on the Lower Rhine gave him the greate&s;t concern, on &s;everal accounts. He had many rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect that a &s;trong party in the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try were for a &s;eparate peace with France, and that the la&s;t convention concluded between him and his Britannic Maje&s;ty on the 9th of November 1759, began to be greatly condemned, chiefly on account of its fourth article, by which his Britan|nic Maje&s;ty tied him&s;elf up from concluding any kind of peace, without the full con&s;ent of his Pru&s;&s;ian ally. He was &s;en&s;ible, as afterwards proved to be the ca&s;e, that if a &s;eparate peace between Great Britain and France was &s;et on foot, it would not be in the power of the former, to put him by any treaty, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e countries which were held by the French, only in tru&s;t for the Empre&s;s Queen. At the &s;ame time, we are to ob&s;erve that the &s;ubjects of the States General had not behaved towards Great Britain, with &s;uch gratitude and attention as intitled them to extraordinary con&s;ideration from
<PB N="142" REF="145">
our crown. Upon the whole, therefore, it is mo&s;t rational to think, that the irruption of the Here|ditary Prince (as was before mentioned) into the territories of Cleves and Gueldres, was &s;ecretly concerted between his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, and the Briti&s;h court, and happy had it been for this nation, if it had been as &s;ucce&s;sful, as it was bold, &s;pirited and well conducted. As to the prepara|tions made at Port&s;mouth they were di&s;avowed to be intended again&s;t the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and their real de&s;tination has never been pub|lickly owned. But it is certain, that had they proceeded to the recovery of Neuport and O&s;tend, and even to overawe &s;ome of our allies, a more popular &s;ervice, at that time, could not have been undertaken by a Briti&s;h Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Unfore&s;een accidents di&s;appointed the full effect of the Prince's irruption. One part of his troops was employed in the &s;iege of We&s;el, on the right of the Rhine; while another covered it on the left. The &s;iege was carried on with great re&s;olution, and &s;anguine expectations were form|ed of its &s;ucce&s;s, by the &s;trong reinforcements that were expected. The va&s;t rains that fell &s;welled the rivers, and not only put a &s;top to their progre&s;s, but rendered the Prince's communica|tion with the be&s;iegers over the Rhine, extremely difficult. Tho&s;e prodigious inundations and falls of rain, gave time for the Marquis de Ca&s;tries to draw together from He&s;&s;e and the Low Countries an army of 30 battalions and 38 &s;quadrons, with which he advanced to Rhinberg, which lay in the very heart of the Prince's late acqui&s;itions, and drove the allies, with &s;ome lo&s;s on both &s;ides, from their po&s;ts there. He then turned to the left towards the convent of Campen, where he formed him&s;elf very advantageou&s;ly. The Prince had now apparently only two objects to pur&s;ue,
<PB N="143" REF="146">
he mu&s;t either fight this &s;uperior army in a pitch|ed battle, or abandon the &s;iege of We&s;el. His genius &s;ugge&s;ted to him a medium. For relying on the known valour of the Briti&s;h troops, which as u&s;ual, formed the flower of his army, he re|&s;olved upon a &s;urprize, and for that purpo&s;e, on the 16th of October at ten at night, he began his march. Fi&s;chers famous body of irregulars lay between him and the French camp. Some &s;hots were exchanged, the French were alarmed, and in&s;tantly drew up in a wood. By this time it was five in the morning, but the &s;ight of the advantageous po&s;ition of the French, far from daunting the Engli&s;h troops, &s;eemed to in&s;pire them with fre&s;h valour. The action with in|ce&s;&s;ant firings, and repeated attacks on the wood, continued from five in the morning to nine at night. This per&s;everance may be called ob&s;ti|nacy by &s;ome, and madne&s;s by others. The Prince animated the troops by his own example, but he was di&s;abled by his hor&s;e being &s;hot under him, and he him&s;elf receiving a wound; &s;o that he was obliged to order a retreat, which perhaps he might have done long before, without any imputation either upon his courage or conduct. The Briti&s;h troops were the chief, if not the &s;ole, &s;ufferers in this de&s;perate action, but the death of none of them was more lamented both in Germany and England than that of the Lord Downe. He &s;eemed to be born for &s;ocial and gay life, but the war no &s;ooner broke out, than he applied him&s;elf, with a mo&s;t &s;urpri|zing progre&s;s, to the mo&s;t laborious duties of a military life. He formed in the country, where he had intere&s;t, a handful of his friends and de|pendents, by his own pains and example, to the exerci&s;es of war, in which they were as complete as the be&s;t regulars in Europe, and he had the
<PB N="144" REF="147">
glory to die as a voluntier at their head. The lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h in killed and wounded were 1190, and about 500 were made pri&s;oners. After the &s;laughter of &s;o many brave men, in a battle which ought to have been fought by others, it is but a poor comfort for an Engli&s;h reader to be told that the lo&s;s of the French was much greater, though it is &s;ome to reflect, that the Briti&s;h va|lour had impre&s;&s;ed the enemy with &s;uch ideas, that they dur&s;t not follow their victory, for &s;uch, indeed, it was they had obtained.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of We&s;el became now impracticable to be carried on, and the hourly increa&s;e of the waters, had the Prince delayed repa&s;&s;ing the Rhine, mu&s;t have rendered his retreat &s;o like|wi&s;e. He &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity, and his manoeuvres were &s;o well concerted, that the French did not attempt even to di&s;turb his rear, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t &s;uperiority they had over him in all re&s;pects, but that of courage. We &s;hall perform the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k, before we leave the operations of the allied army this year, of following them into their winter-quarters, which proved more fatal to them than the cam|paign it&s;elf, &s;evere as their hard&s;hips had been during it, and unequal as the &s;hare of &s;ervice was, which they had undergone. Upon the re|turn of the Hereditary Prince to the allied army, the blockade of Gottingen was attempted, and continued from the 22d of November to the 12th of December following. The operations that preceded this &s;iege was as languid as they were indeci&s;ive. A Hanoverian General attempted to take Heydemunden, but failed of &s;ucce&s;s in a mo&s;t unaccountable, if not &s;hameful, manner; and the Freneh defended Gottingen &s;o bravely, that the blockade was rai&s;ed. Soon after, both armies rather &s;lipped, than marched, into winter-quarters.

Prince Ferdinand made his as com|fortable as he could, by having behind him a country not quite exhau&s;ted, and by giving large premi|ums to the country people for &s;upplying his camp with provi&s;ions. The winter quarters of the Briti&s;h troops were in the city and bi&s;hopric of Paderborn, the mo&s;t exhau&s;ted place, of the mo&s;t exhau&s;ted country in Europe, for &s;uch Ger|many then was. Their mi&s;erable condition was encrea&s;ed by the extortions and villanies of their Jewi&s;h and other contractors, and the whole was crowned by the difficulties of the roads through the late rains. The con&s;equences were, that di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds broke in upon them, and carried off a prodigious number both men and hor&s;es, while their mi&s;eries were em|bittered by &s;eeing the French in a mo&s;t advan|tageous po&s;ition, where they received, by the Rhine and the Maine, all the comforts of life.</P>
<P>While our army abroad remained in this un|comfortable &s;ituation, the great and unexpected event of the death of George the 2d happened, on the 25th of October 1760, between the hours of &s;even and eight in the morning, in the 77th year of his age, and the 34th of his reign. His death was occa&s;ioned by a rupture of the &s;ub|&s;tance of the right ventricle of his heart, which was uncommonly dilated&punc; and which, by &s;top|ping the circulation, put an immediate end to his life, without the &s;malle&s;t apparent pain. For &s;ome years before, he had few or no illne&s;&s;es, but &s;uch as were incident to his advanced age, and his death depended &s;o entirely upon natural cau&s;es, which appeared at the time of his body being open|ed, that it is in vain to &s;eek for any other. The la&s;t que&s;tion he ever a&s;ked was, in the morning of his death, when he enquired what quarter
<PB N="146" REF="149">
the wind was in, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome anxiety about the &s;ailing of his fleet.</P>
<P>The uncommon term of life which he enjoyed, which was longer than that of any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors, was owing to his temperance, &s;obriety, and regularity. If he had fits of pa&s;&s;ion, they were &s;o &s;oon over, that they may be &s;aid rather to have circulated his blood, than to have di&s;|ordered his con&s;titution, and he was ble&s;t with a peculiar magnanimity, that quickly got the bet|ter of any feelings from the blows of fortune; though he had &s;hewed a &s;incere concern at the death of his Queen, and was &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender, as well as the violent, pa&s;&s;ions. To his dome&s;tics he was a con&s;tant and an ea&s;y ma&s;ter, and in private he gave them le&s;s trouble than any gentleman of five hundred pounds a year would have given his. He was a Prince of indefatigable ap|plication to bu&s;ine&s;s, and had numerous private corre&s;pondents whom he directed and an&s;wered with his own hand, for he was generally &s;tirring at &s;even in the morning, and was employed till near nine in writing letters. By this means, he came to the knowledge of many important par|ticulars in the courts he was concerned with, and it was thought, he had the be&s;t intelligence of any man in England. Sometimes, however, he was impo&s;ed on, though, upon the whole, it co&s;t him va&s;t &s;ums. He was equally ju&s;t to his pri|vate as public, engagements. He hated lying, and dete&s;ted cowardice. In his private oeconomy he was mo&s;t exact, and in his per&s;onal expences more frugal, than became a great King. He may be &s;aid to have been rather magnanimous than generous. He looked upon the many exorbiant abu&s;es and impo&s;itions that prevailed in his court, as the lawful perqui&s;ites of his &s;tate officers and their dependents, and never encouraged any &s;e|vere
<PB N="147" REF="150">
reformation of his public expences. From this principle, he &s;uffered him&s;elf in &s;ome parti|culars to be ill treated, and in others to be &s;erved with &s;carcely the decency, far le&s;s the magnifi|cence, that ought to appear in a royal palace.</P>
<P>As the head ju&s;ticiary of his people, he was &s;crupulous of blood, and has been often known to inform him&s;elf minutely of the circum&s;tances of the trial, before he &s;igned the &s;entence, but this tenderne&s;s never led him to break into the great lines of either public or private ju&s;tice. He was &s;o con&s;cious of the difficulty he had to re&s;i&s;t ap|plications in capital matters, that he formally de|clared, upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion of 1745, that he &s;hould be directed by his council as to the puni&s;hment of the offenders, and it is &s;aid, he &s;trictly adhered to this re&s;olution. His per&s;on, though &s;carcely of midling &s;tature, was erect and well made. His air be&s;poke him to be a King, and there was a dignity even in the neg|ligences of his dre&s;s. That he had great natural courage, would be ridiculous to doubt, and he was him&s;elf a mo&s;t excellent General. But we mu&s;t now attend the mo&s;t public parts of his cha|racter, in which he will appear, every thing con|&s;idered, &s;uperior to the mo&s;t glorious of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>He came to England with &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and &s;ome prejudices, as to parties and public af|fairs. It was not without rea&s;on, he thought he had been ill treated by the tories, and that Queen Anne had encouraged a faction in favour of the Pretender. He had been bred up with the highe&s;t opinion of the mea&s;ures formed by King William again&s;t the power of France, and he had &s;erved under the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Generals of that con|federacy. He thought, that the &s;upport of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria again&s;t that of Bourbon ought
<PB N="148" REF="151">
to be the ruling principle of every German pa|triot, and it was &s;o much his own, that even after he came to the crown, he voluntarily ventured his per&s;on at the head of an army in that cau&s;e; and this, together with the va&s;t &s;ub&s;idies he and his Parliament granted to the heire&s;s of the Au&s;|trian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, enabled her to maintain it, other|wi&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have lo&s;t it. Notwith&s;tanding many provocations he received from her ob&s;tinacy and inveteracy again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, during the cour&s;e of that war, he never would have abandoned her, had &s;he not abandoned every principle of ju&s;tice, honour, and policy, in join|ing with France, the hereditary enemy of his own and her dominions. His attachments to his elec|torate, &s;trong and natural as they are acknow|ledged to have been, gave way on the &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion; a &s;ignal proof of the rectitude of his heart, as well as the &s;oundne&s;s of his judgment. Tho' the chief imputation upon his reign is the above|mentioned attachment, yet if we &s;hould candidly examine it, it would be found to &s;pring from the concern he took, in pre&s;erving the independency of the Germanic con&s;titution, with which he was perfectly well acquainted, and upon which he thought the liberties of all Europe depended. If he erred in this, he erred in common with the greate&s;t patriots and politicians, that this, and the four preceding ages have produced, even in England it&s;elf.</P>
<P>His conduct as a King of Great Britain was irreproachable, for he &s;uffered on many occa&s;ions his public duties, to get the better of his private affections. By the mere force of good &s;en&s;e he guided parties, by &s;uffering them to think that they were guiding him; for, during the long cour&s;e of his reign, he never once failed attaining the favou|rite objects he kept in view. He had the hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="149" REF="152">
to live till he &s;aw national parties aboli&s;hed in his regal dominions. This, towards the lat|ter end of his reign, rendered his natural di&s;po|&s;ition practicable, mild, and indeed amiable, and tho&s;e qualities every day grew, by the encrea&s;e of his &s;ubjects affection to his per&s;on and family, which they procured him. This was the true &s;ource of that unexampled unanimity, which during the latter years of his reign, rendered him one of the greate&s;t monarchs that ever &s;at on any throne.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much, we may almo&s;t venture to pronounce, that he died in the height of his happine&s;s, as well as of his glory. Had he &s;ur|vived a few months, his &s;atisfaction mu&s;t have been embittered, by the growing di&s;contents of his &s;ubjects, at the &s;ufferings of their brave countrymen in Germany, as well as the prodi|gious expences and &s;ub&s;idies paid to maintain that war. The enemies of his government, during the fir&s;t twelve or thirteen years of his reign, ac|cu&s;ed it of &s;candalous corruption at home, and in|glorious inactivity abroad. We &s;hall not vindi|cate his then Mini&s;ter, further than by repeating what he &s;aid him&s;elf, that when he came to pow|er, &s;uch was his degeneracy of the Engli&s;h, that he was obliged to bribe them even to their duty. That our foreign inactivity was inglorious, is far from being clear; but it is certain, that during that inactivity, the commerce of Great Britain was &s;ilently rooting it&s;elf through all quarters of the Globe, and produced tho&s;e glorious fruits which we reaped when activity became nece&s;&s;ary. Before we clo&s;e this part of his character, it is but doing it common ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that his electoral dominions, again&s;t the general opinion, were irreparably injured by the acce&s;&s;ion of his
<PB N="150" REF="153">
family to the crown of Great Britain, and this may &s;erve as an apology for any little partialities he &s;hewed his &s;ubjects there, by &s;ometimes keep|ing his court at Hanover.</P>
<P>The polite arts flouri&s;hed in England during his reign, tho' they were but little indebted to his encouragement. Be&s;ides German, French and Italian, he had no mean knowledge of the Latin, and could conver&s;e in the Engli&s;h tongue, but he read his &s;peeches to parliament with a bad grace, and in a di&s;agreeable tone. He encou|raged a &s;trict, but not a &s;evere, far le&s;s a cruel, ob&s;ervance of military di&s;cipline, and he loved tho&s;e Generals, as well as Mini&s;ters, who&s;e years approached neare&s;t to his own. But he often employed tho&s;e who were much younger, and till he did &s;o, it cannot be &s;aid, that his armies were in any excellent condition. He was as pla|cable in his public, as he was in his private, re|&s;entments. Though he hated France, yet he never manife&s;ted that hatred indecently, and when he came into a good under&s;tanding with his ne|phew the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, he talked of him, as if there never had been the lea&s;t difference be|tween them. When the party, that had given him the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s in his royal dominions, came into power, (which &s;ome of its leaders cer|tainly did again&s;t his inclination) he &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all remembrance of what had pa&s;&s;ed; and at the &s;ame time he never altered his counte|nance or manner towards tho&s;e Mini&s;ters and officers of &s;tate who had been removed. Not|with&s;tanding all this, he was much &s;ubject to per&s;onal prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which he never was at pains to conceal, for he &s;eemed to catch them by impul&s;e. But they &s;eldom were known to be attended with con&s;equences to the prejudice of their objects. His temperance and frugality in|duced
<PB N="151" REF="154">
many to think he died rich, e&s;pecially as he had a large privy pur&s;e; but that was far from being the ca&s;e. The money and effects of every kind, that he left behind him, were of very little value, which mu&s;t be owing to his private boun|ties. But I am now to return to the main &s;ubject of this review, by re&s;uming the hi&s;tory of the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian war.</P>
<P>It is more than probable, that the pre&s;ent King and his Mini&s;ters, upon his Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, had &s;ecretly re&s;olved to bind up the wounds of England and Europe, and to clo&s;e the &s;cene of blood; but to do it in a way that was con&s;i&s;tent with their own, and the national ho|nour. An immediate publication of &s;uch a re&s;o|lution mu&s;t have been attended with the wor&s;t effects both at home and abroad, as it mu&s;t have damped the intere&s;ts of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, and of our prote&s;tant allies in Germany. Therefore, on the 18th of November, when the Parliament met, his Maje&s;ty declared he would continue the war, till he &s;hould obtain a &s;afe and honourable peace. This declaration gave great &s;pirits to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who was at this time in the &s;outhern parts of Sile&s;ia, while a great body of Ru&s;&s;ians under Count Czernichew, had entered the new Marche of Brandenburgh, and 15,000 Au&s;trians propo&s;ed to meet them under the Ge|nerals Lacy and Brentano at the gates of Berlin, the whole amounting to 40,000 men. The Pru&s;|&s;ian Generals Hul&s;en and Werner, after a variety of rapid marches and artful movements, endea|voured to cover that capital; but their whole force did not amount to 16,000 men; &s;o that all they could do was to make a faint oppo&s;ition to the advanced body of the Ru&s;&s;ians under Count Tottleben, and to retreat, after throwing into the city three incomplete battalions. Thus his
<PB N="152" REF="155">
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's capital, the proud the envied &s;eat of arms and arts, adorned with all the im|provements and beauties, that a long &s;eries of wi&s;e princes could give it, the populous re&s;idence of the popi&s;h, as well as the reformed religion, was in a manner abandoned to the power of in|veterate enemies, and barbarous conquerors, who were plea&s;ed with the near pro&s;pect they had of plundering one of the fine&s;t cities in the world. The inhabitants were manufacturers, &s;hopkeepers, merchants and arti&s;ts, but they knew nothing of arms, and gave them&s;elves up to total de&s;pondency. The garri&s;on was weak and became pri&s;oners of war; &s;o that the former had now nothing to depend upon to &s;ave them from the wor&s;t of fates, but the mediation of the foreign Mini&s;ters re&s;iding at Ber|lin. This proved far more effectual than was expected. A free exerci&s;e of religion was granted to the inhabitants; they were to be protected in in their per&s;ons and effects, and it was agreed that the Ru&s;&s;ian irregulars &s;hould not enter the city. Notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e favourable terms, great exce&s;&s;es were committed. The regulars, who marched in, de&s;troyed the magazines, the founda|ries, and all the warehou&s;es of military &s;tores, of which they &s;eized immen&s;e quantities, be&s;ides artillery and arms. The contributions that were demanded amounted to a regular kind of plun|dering the city. Eight hundred thou&s;and guilders were ordered to be immediately paid down, and a further contribution of 1,900,000 German crowns was impo&s;ed, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficul|ty that the officers were able to pre&s;erve a tolera|ble degree of di&s;cipline among&s;t the barbarians.</P>
<P>The public, con&s;idering the exa&s;perated &s;tate of the Au&s;trians, was &s;urprized that the inhabi|tants of Berlin had &s;uffered &s;o little as they did.
<PB N="153" REF="156">
We may partly account for this by the great in|dulgences, and freedom they enjoyed in that city, which made it the re&s;idence of &s;trangers of all re|ligions, and from all parts of Germany; &s;o that it is ea&s;y to be &s;uppo&s;ed, the Au&s;trians, (officers as well as &s;oldiers) who entered it, had many friends and relations there. This account is the more probable, as both Au&s;trians and Ru&s;&s;ians were guilty of the mo&s;t ungenerous and unmanly depredations upon the royal palace. Like true de&s;cendents of the Goths and Vandals, they plundered the royal palace of Charlottenburg, de&s;troyed the furniture they could not carry off, defaced, the paintings, and broke in pieces the noble collection of antique and other &s;tatues that had belonged to the Brandenburg family, and particularly that made by the famous Cardinal Polignac. The Queen's ca&s;tle of Schonhau&s;en, and that of the Margrave Charles of Fredericks|field experienced the like treatment. Amid&s;t the numerous ho&s;t of barbarians, one General was found who de&s;erves a better epithet. This was Prince E&s;terha&s;i, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa|lace of Pot&s;dam, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's &s;ans &s;ouci. All the ravage there committed was, that the Prince in viewing the apartments, took into his cu&s;tody the picture which he was told bore the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, and two German flutes which he u&s;ually played on, and even that, not without a&s;king the leave of the keepers of the palace.</P>
<P>On the 13th of October, Berlin was evacuated after groaning for four days under the &s;courge of the Au&s;trians and Ru&s;&s;ians, who left Branden|burg little better than a de&s;ert, having de&s;troyed the country and carried off all the hor&s;es and cattle they could find. The con&s;equence of this blow upon his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was, that having no
<PB N="154" REF="157">
army in Saxony, his enemies after leaving Ber|lin, recovered all that electorate, while Stainville at the head of a detachment of Broglio's army, laid Hulber&s;tadt under contribution, and the Ru&s;&s;ians laid &s;iege to the important &s;ea-port of Colberg. The Swedes, all this while, were ad|vancing in the we&s;tern Pomerania, and in Sile&s;ia. Laudohn inve&s;ted the fortre&s;s of Co&s;el. In &s;hort, upon the whole, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's affairs &s;eemed to be now more de&s;perate than ever. When his enemies took the cities of Wittemberg, Mei&s;&s;en, Leip&s;ic, and Torgau, he lo&s;t all his im|men&s;e magazines of &s;tores, and he him&s;elf was clo&s;ely watched by a far &s;uperior army, under the mo&s;t vigilent general of his age, Count Daun, without his knowing where to take his winter quarters; &s;o completely had his enemies ravaged his dominions. He had made &s;ome movements towards the relief of his capital, and upon its being evacuated, he pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe the 25th of October, as Daun did the &s;ame day. Soon after his Maje&s;ty was joined by his Generals, Hul&s;en and Prince Eugene of Wirtemberg, but found him&s;elf under circum&s;tances in which he could get relief only from de&s;pair. His was not of the blind, furious kind; his di&s;po&s;itions were as wi&s;e as his conduct was intrepid. Daun, that he might cover Leip&s;ic and Torgau, had fallen back upon the latter, and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;aw him en|camped at the head of 80,000 men, &s;ecured on the one &s;ide by the Elbe of the other by Mora&s;&s;es, hills and woods, with 200 pieces of cannon in his front, where alone he could be attacked. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, undaunted by that dreadful ob|ject, acquainted his troops in per&s;on, on the 3d of November, that he would that day &s;et them an example to conquer or die. He gave General
<PB N="155" REF="158">
Hul&s;en the command of his right wing, with or|ders to take po&s;t in a wood to the left of the Au&s;trians, and there to wait till the battle &s;hould begin. General Ziethen with the left wing, was to attack the right of the enemy, while the King was to make the grand charge in the front. The&s;e di&s;po&s;itions directed Daun in his, and he made them in a ma&s;terly manner. Ziethen began the attack, upon which his Maje&s;ty ha&s;tened his march. The &s;ituation of both armies was &s;uch, ac|cording to the accounts publi&s;hed at Magdeburg, that either the Pru&s;&s;ian right or left mu&s;t take the enemy in their rear, and &s;o prevent their afford|ing any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that part of their army, where the main attack was to be made. It would be mi&s;pending the readers time to think of de&s;cribing a battle &s;o exten&s;ive and complicated, as this was, in which, even they who were pre&s;ent, di&s;agree as to their &s;everal relations. It is allowed on all hands that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, rapid and intre|pid as his charge was, was three times repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter; but General Ziethen having beat the right wing of the Au&s;trians, made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;ome advantageous eminences, and galloping up with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e to &s;u&s;|tain the infantry, the latter, notwith&s;tanding their prodigious lo&s;&s;es and fatigues, returned once more to the charge, and proved victorious. The enemy was every where routed with va&s;t &s;laugh|ter after a continued engagement, from two in the afternoon to nine at night, when the Au&s;tri|ans were obliged to repa&s;s the Elbe, which they did in excellent order.</P>
<P>This battle was the mo&s;t important of any his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had yet gained, and co&s;t him the deare&s;t, but it was attended with the mo&s;t won|derful, though favourable, circum&s;tances for him.
<PB N="156" REF="159">
He had lo&s;t in killed and wounded about 10,000 of his be&s;t men, be&s;ides 3000 who were made pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the Au&s;trians in men was not greater. The Pru&s;&s;ians, however, made about 8,000 pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom were four Generals, and 216 other officers, and were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t number of warlike trophies taken from the enemy. Both &s;ides &s;eem to agree that the Pru&s;&s;ians victory was owing, next to their own valour, and that of their King, to a wound which Count Daun received in the thigh, and which obliged him to retire from the field of battle, and to leave the command to Ge|neral O'Donnel, who ordered the retreat. The pitchy darkne&s;s of the night was equally favour|able to both armies, fatigued and exhau&s;ted as they were.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna was &s;urprized, a&s;toni&s;h|ed, and a&s;hamed at this &s;udden rever&s;e of fortune. In vain did the Mini&s;ters of the Queen in publi|cations of every kind, endeavour to extenuate their lo&s;s, and to magnify that of their enemy; all they could do was to keep up the de&s;ponding &s;pirits of their allies. They could not di&s;&s;emble that, be&s;ides all the other di&s;advantages the Pru&s;|&s;ians lay under in the attack, the Au&s;trians were 30,000 &s;uperior to them in the field, &s;o that the palm of general&s;hip and di&s;cipline was by the public voice adjudged to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who received a contu&s;ion in the brea&s;t, and dur|ing the hotte&s;t of the action, expo&s;ed his per&s;on, as if he had known him&s;elf to be immortal. But the con&s;equences decided beyond all di&s;pute the vic|tory to be in his favour, for he recovered all Saxony but its capital, and he was in no condition to be|&s;iege that, becau&s;e Count Daun had po&s;ted all his army, which was &s;till more numerous than that
<PB N="157" REF="160">
of the Pru&s;&s;ians in that city, or in cantonments round it. In the mean time the Pru&s;&s;ian Gene|ral Werner had, after the evacuation of Berlin, been &s;ent with a body of troops into Pomerania, where he obliged the Ru&s;&s;ians to abandon the long continued &s;iege of Colberg, and after de|feating the Swedes in the we&s;tern parts of that province, he forced them to fall back upon Stral&s;und, and to abandon the whole of the Pru&s;|&s;ian Pomerania. On the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, Laudohn was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Co&s;el to abandon Land&s;hut, and to retire into the Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia, while the Ru&s;&s;ians had entirely evacuated the other parts of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's dominions, and the army of the Empire, about the &s;ame time, retired into Franconia.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty lo&s;t no advantage that could po&s;&s;ibly be drawn from his victory at Tor|gau, as was before mentioned. Pretending to have received great provocation, he taxed the circle of Leip&s;ic alone, not only in its ordinary revenue, and in va&s;t magazines of provi&s;ions, but in two millions of crowns for the en&s;uing year, a contribution, which London it&s;elf, the riche&s;t city in the world, would have found dif|ficult to rai&s;e. All the other parts of Mi&s;nia were taxed in the &s;ame proportion, and, e&s;timating the Saxons as bea&s;ts of burden, he made the rai&s;ing 20,000 of them, for recruiting his army, a part of their contributions. But no country &s;uffered more from his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's &s;ucce&s;&s;es, than the dominions of the Dukes of Mecklenburgh, which were &s;o unfortunately &s;ituated, with re|gard to tho&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia, that they were deprived of relief from their allies. The treatment which tho&s;e Princes met with, and the hard&s;hips in|flicted on their &s;ubjects, were, perhaps, more
<PB N="158" REF="161">
than &s;evere, and are &s;aid to have drawn from the pen of a young Prince&s;s, who now fills the mo&s;t augu&s;t throne in the world, a pathetic repre&s;enta|tion of her family and country's &s;ufferings, which touched even his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, but made much deeper impre&s;&s;ions in the brea&s;t of another, and a greater royal per&s;onage, to whom the letter was communicated. Such was the &s;ituation of affairs on the continent of Europe, at the clo&s;e of the year 1760, that of the Pru&s;&s;ians was indeed be|come better, but that of the Briti&s;h troops was very unde&s;ireable, while the Au&s;trians and the French, by pre&s;erving their communications, the former with the Elbe, and the latter with the Rhine, enjoyed comfortable winter quarters.</P>
<P>We are now to attend the motions of a ma|rine Don Quixote. Thurot had all the enter|pri&s;ing, genius, the valour, the genero&s;ity, and even the magnanimity of that celebrated knight errand. His birth was ob&s;cure, if not fabulous, and his out&s;et into the world romatic. He, how|ever, rai&s;ed him&s;elf by a &s;eries of bold, but for|tunate adventures, to the notice of the French mini&s;try, who appointed him to the command of five frigates, with 1270 land &s;oldiers on board. During the equipment of tho&s;e frigates of Dun|kirk, various were the conjectures of the public, which probably never was determined any fur|ther, than that Thurot &s;hould make a landing on &s;ome part of Ireland, which &s;hould be mo&s;t con|venient for favouring the grand expedition under Conflans. On the 5th of October, 1759, the five frigates e&s;caped the Engli&s;h fleet, in a hazy night, out of Dunkirk; in ten days they reached Gottenburg in Sweden, and after that, Bergen in Norway, but not without &s;uffering &s;o much by &s;ickne&s;s and &s;tre&s;s of weather, that Thurot was obliged to &s;end his be&s;t frigate back to
<PB N="159" REF="162">
France. Sailing from Bergen, he was, for almo&s;t three months, buffetted about the &s;eas, and lo&s;t one of his remaining frigates, which has never &s;ince been heard of. In vain he attempted to land near Derry in Ireland, and, on the 16th of February, he was obliged to put into the i&s;le of Ilay, one of the Hebrides of the coa&s;t of Scot|land, where he refitted his &s;hips, and paid, even to profu&s;ion, for &s;ome provi&s;ions and cattle they took in. The accounts he received of the defeat of Conflans appeared to him &s;u&s;picious, and did not deter him from pur&s;uing his cour&s;e towards Ireland, where, on the 28th of February, he landed his troops, which were now reduced to 600 men, at Carrickfergus; but, by draughts from the &s;eamen, he made a &s;hift to mu&s;ter up about 1000 on the breach, and with them he pro|ceeded to attack the town, which was defended by Colonel Jennings, with about four compa|nies of new rai&s;ed men, de&s;titute of cannon and with very little ammunition. The Colonel, how|ever, made the be&s;t defence he could at the gate of the town, till his ammunition being &s;pent, he drew off his men towards the Ca&s;tle, which, like the town wall, was old, ruinous and untena|ble, &s;o that his men were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. After this, Carrick|fergus, becau&s;e its magi&s;trates refu&s;ed to comply with Thurot's demands of wine and provi&s;ions, was plundered, and Thurot re-imbarked his men for France.</P>
<P>The Duke of Bedford was then Lord Lieute|nant of Ireland, and receiving early intelligence of Thurot's de&s;cent, he di&s;patched an expre&s;s to Kin&s;ale for three Engli&s;h frigates, who lay there to &s;ail in que&s;t of Thurot. One of tho&s;e fri|gates, commanded by Captain Elliot, carried 36 guns, the other two, 32 each, and &s;o great
<PB N="160" REF="163">
was their di&s;patch, that they came up with Thu|rot in &s;ight of the I&s;le of Man. Here the a&s;cen|dency of the Briti&s;h, over the French maritime genius, was fully proved. Thurot's &s;hips were of greater force, and he fought with a great &s;u|periority of numbers on his &s;ide. He had every motive that could animate a brave man to exert his utmo&s;t, which indeed he did, for he was kil|led in the di&s;charge of his duty, and all the three &s;hips, being taken by the Engli&s;h, were carried into Ram&s;ay bay in the I&s;le of Man. Thurot was lamented, le&s;s, perhaps, by his countrymen, than his enemies, who had often experienced his humanity, as well as his courage; and thus the on|ly in&s;ult, that his Britannic Maje&s;ty's European coa&s;ts had &s;uffered during the war, was amply revenged.&mdash;We are now to attend America.</P>
<P>After the French had been forced to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Quebec, Vaudreuil the Governor of Canada took po&s;t at Montreal, where he a&s;&s;em|bled all his force, with the appearance of prepar|ing for a deci&s;ive effort. Finding the Canadians were di&s;couraged, he had re&s;ource to circulating, by his letters to them, the meane&s;t lies, on the prodigious &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the French arms through all the quarters of the globe, to keep up their &s;pirits, while the difficulty of entering Canada, he thought, would put the Briti&s;h troops under &s;uch difficulties as would render all attempts again&s;t Montreal fruitle&s;s, at lea&s;t for that cam|paign.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of June, Mr. Amher&s;t, who com|manded in chief the Briti&s;h forces in America, left Shenectady, and on the 9th of July, he ar|rived at O&s;wego, where, on a review of his army, he found it to amount to 10,000 men, of whom 1000, a &s;ight never known before, were Iroquois, brought by Sir William John&s;on to fight in a
<PB N="161" REF="164">
Briti&s;h quarrel. Before Sir William John&s;on left Shenectady, he had ordered General Murray to advance with all the force he could &s;pare from the garri&s;on of Quebec, towards Montreal, while Colonel Haviland was to &s;ail from Crown Point, and after taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;le au Noix, to proceed to Montreal likewi&s;e. On the 10th of Augu&s;t, Amher&s;t's army embarked with its baggage, ammunition, and artillery, on the lake of Ontario, the mo&s;t numerous body, per|haps, that ever traver&s;ed in boats &s;o prodigious an expance of water. Good fortune, and good con|duct, equally befriended him. He took Swe|gatchie and inve&s;ted L'I&s;le Royal, in the river of St. Laurence, the forts of which &s;urrendered to him on the 25th of Augu&s;t. Having made all the proper arrangements in that i&s;land, which is of the utmo&s;t importance for commanding the Lake, as well as &s;ecuring the Briti&s;h frontier, he pro|ceeded to the mo&s;t difficult part of his expedition, that of encountering the rapid falls of the river St. Laurence, between L'I&s;le Royal and Mon|treal. Amher&s;t &s;urmounted even that difficulty, with the lo&s;s of many of his ve&s;&s;els, but no more than ninety lives; and on the 6th of September, his army came in &s;ight of Montreal, the &s;econd city of importance for &s;trength, &s;ituation and riches in the French America. The very day that Amher&s;t landed here, General Murray landed from Quebec, and next day Haviland from the I&s;le au Noix; &s;o great was the preci&s;ion with which this expedition was planned and executed.</P>
<P>After &s;urmounting &s;uch incredible difficulties, and arriving before Montreal, the Briti&s;h Gene|rals &s;carcely thought the reduction of that place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o be an object of their concern. Vaudreuil &s;ur|rendered it, and the garri&s;on were &s;ent pri&s;oners to France on condition of their not &s;erving again
<PB N="162" REF="165">
that war. Nothing, in the &s;ucce&s;s of this expe|dition, covered the Briti&s;h Generals with &s;o much glory, as did the humanity which attended their conque&s;ts. Except at the I&s;le Royal no blood was &s;pilt, and it was with the utmo&s;t reluctance that General Murray in his march from Quebec, found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of giving orders for &s;etting on fire &s;ome villages who&s;e inhabitants were in arms again&s;t him. At Montreal no per|&s;on was injured. The Briti&s;h Generals relieved the mi&s;ery of the Canadians, by giving them food, and notwith&s;tanding all the provocations they had received during the cour&s;e of the war, from the treachery of the French, they employed their &s;oldiers in defending them, from the &s;calping knives of their own, the neutral, and the Briti&s;h &s;avages, who know no ties of obedience or gra|titude but conque&s;t.</P>
<P>During the reduction of Montreal, which com|pleted our conque&s;t of all Canada, a Briti&s;h &s;quadron under Lord Colville, commanded the mouth of the river St. Laurence, which three French frigates, with about 20 &s;ail of &s;hips, loaded with troops and military &s;tores for relieving Mon|treal, ob&s;erving they put into the bay of Chaleurs, but being di&s;covered, their whole armament was taken by the Lord Byron, a Captain of one of the Briti&s;h &s;hips.</P>
<P>The French were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful in their other &s;chemes upon the va&s;t continent. Having, by means of their mi&s;&s;ionaries, a much greater power, than the Engli&s;h have over the minds of the &s;avages, they had debauched the Cherokee In|dians into their intere&s;t, and there was rea&s;on for believing, that the Creeks, another very power|ful nation, would follow their example. What|ever flattering pictures philo&s;ophers or philo&s;ophi|cal hi&s;torians may exhibit of human nature in
<PB N="163" REF="166">
its mo&s;t &s;avage &s;tate, there is rea&s;on to believe from repeated experience, that the American In|dians in general, have no &s;entiments but tho&s;e of cruelty, revenge and rapine, which they never &s;ail to gratify; and that they are to be awed only by force. Mr. Lyttleton, who was the Governor of Carolina, knew this, and in October, 1759, he marched with about 1100 regulars and provin|cials, 300 miles into their country, lying be|tween Keeowee and Charles Town. The bar|barians, thus &s;eeing their per&s;ons and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions ex|po&s;ed to immediate de&s;truc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, humbled them|&s;elves before the Governo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, and agreed to all the terms he impo&s;ed. They even put into his hands &s;uch of their countrymen as had been guilty of the greate&s;t barbarities and murders upon the Engli&s;h, and gave him 22 ho&s;tages for their per|formance.</P>
<P>Mr. Littleton having, as he had rea&s;on to think, been &s;ucce&s;sful in his expedition, returned to his government: but no &s;ooner was his back turned, than the very &s;ame Savages blocked up Fort Loudon, and attempted to take Fort Ed|ward. General Amher&s;t, hearing of this, &s;ent Colonel Montgomery to relieve tho&s;e two Briti&s;h forts, and to cha&s;ti&s;e the barbarians, with a re|giment of Highlanders, a battalion of Royal Americans, &s;ome grenadiers, and the provincial troops. Upon his entering the country of the Savages, he burnt one of their capital towns con&s;i&s;ting of about 200 hou&s;es, and making war after their own manner, he &s;pread terror and de|&s;olation wherever he came. He marched on to the middle Cherokees, and in his progre&s;s fell into an ambu&s;h, where he had 20 men killed and 80 wounded. Though the enemy in this &s;kirmi&s;h lo&s;t 80 men, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable town, yet the Colonel perceiving that he mu&s;t every day meet
<PB N="164" REF="167">
with &s;uch encounters as he advanced, found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to retreat to Fort St. George, from whence he went to New York, to rejoin the grand army; but left behind him 400 men for the protection of the province. But by this time the garri&s;on of Fort Loudon having con&s;umed all their provi&s;ions was obliged to come to a capitulation, Augu&s;t the 7th, with the barbarians, who mo&s;t infamou&s;ly broke it by butchering all the officers but one, and by carrying &s;uch of the &s;oldiers as they did not kill into the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all captivities. We are now to take a long &s;tride from America to A&s;ia.</P>
<P>On the 16th of April, 1759, after the &s;iege of Fort St. George had been rai&s;ed, Major Brereton took the town and fort of Conjioeram; as Major Ford did by &s;torm the city of Ma&s;ulipatam; while Colonel Clive drove the French out of the rich province of Bengal. Thus the Engli&s;h company was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the commerce of a va&s;t trading and manufacturing country on the coa&s;t of Coro|mandel, while that of their enemies was confined almo&s;t to Pondicherry alone. In September, Major Brereton at the head of about 12,000 men, was defeated with the lo&s;s of 3 or 4000 killed and wounded, by an army of French and Indi|ans; and the French General Lally threatened the &s;iege of Trichenopoly. In the mean while, Colonel Coote, with all the troops he could a&s;|&s;emble, took Wandewa&s;h in three days, making the garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war; and in four he be|came ma&s;ter of Carongoly, and obliged the gar|ri&s;on to march out of the place. Tho&s;e two places were taken, the fir&s;t on the 30th of Novem|ber, and the la&s;t on the 10th of December. Upon this Lally laid &s;iege to Wandewa&s;h, a place of the utmo&s;t importance to either party, and pro|bably would have retaken it, had not Colonel
<PB N="165" REF="168">
Coote, with inconceivable diligence marched to its relief. This brought on a battle. Lally's army was compo&s;ed of about 2200 Europeans and between nine and 10,000 blacks, that of Coote amounted to about 1700 Europeans and 3000 blacks. The victory fell to the Engli&s;h after a bloody di&s;pute; for the French were totally routed and their camp and artillery were taken. Of the French army about 1000 were killed and wounded, and among&s;t the pri&s;oners was Brigadier General Bu&s;&s;y, who was reckoned the riche&s;t &s;ubject in the world; the Chevalier Godeville, quarter-ma&s;ter General, and Lieutenant Colonel Murphy. Of the Engli&s;h, 200 were killed and wounded, among&s;t the former was the brave Major Brereton, and 70 of their black &s;oldiers were &s;lain or wounded.</P>
<P>This important victory did great honour to Colonel Coote as a commander. It opened his way to Chittiput and Arcot the capital of the province; both which places were reduced by the Engli&s;h, and in the latter 300 Europeans were made pri&s;oners of war. On the 4th of Septem|ber, Admiral Pocock defeated the fleet of M. D'Ache the French Admiral, and obliged him to take &s;helter under the walls of Pondicherry. This naval victory was the more glorious to the conqueror as D'Ache was not only a mo&s;t excel|lent officer, but commanded a fleet far &s;uperior to that of the Engli&s;h in the number and largene&s;s of men and &s;hips, as well as the weight of metal. In this fight, which continued very hot for above two hours, eight Engli&s;h &s;hips &s;tood the fire of 16 French, and lo&s;t 560 men, while the lo&s;s of the French was 1000, and the ve&s;&s;els on both &s;ides were di&s;abled; D'Ache retired under the cannon of Pondicherry, where Pocock, after he had re|fitted his &s;hips, braved and blocked him up. Soon
<PB N="166" REF="169">
after, upon the junction of Admiral Corni&s;h with Pocock on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, the French &s;hips found means to e&s;cape, and &s;ome of them &s;aved them&s;elves, it was thought, by &s;ailing to the i&s;land St. Mauritius, for they di&s;appeared from tho&s;e &s;eas. The con&s;equence of this was, that Admiral Corni&s;h and Major Monkton took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, on the 5th of April, of the important for|tre&s;s of Carcal; and thus the French power on that coa&s;t was confined to Pondicherry, and a few other incon&s;iderable places.</P>
<P>Pondicherry is a noble &s;trong town, four leagues in circumference, and about 40 miles di&s;tant from the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement of Madra&s;s. The French at this place had been accumulating wealth for many years; and it was now the center of all the riches in tho&s;e parts, being well provided with artillery and military &s;tores. The officer, who commanded the garri&s;on, was Lally an Iri&s;hman, or of an Iri&s;h family, a man, whim&s;ical, haughty and ill fitted for either &s;uperiority over, or &s;ociety with, the wealthy, di&s;&s;olute, proud, &s;elfi&s;h French A&s;iatics. At the &s;ame time he was &s;ober, faithful, brave to exce&s;s, and an excellent di&s;ciplinarian. When the &s;iege of Pondicherry was re&s;olved on, the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about 1500 European regulars; and Lally, who had the utmo&s;t abhor|rence for the profligacy and impiety of the mer|chants and inhabitants, obliged many of them to do duty likewi&s;e, when Colonel Coote and Admi|ral Stevens, the fir&s;t by land, the other by &s;ea, in|ve&s;ted the place. It was &s;urrounded by adjacent fortre&s;&s;es, which in former &s;ieges had given us great trouble, but were now ea&s;ily reduced, as the neigh|bouring country was in the hands of the Engli&s;h. The approaching rainy &s;ea&s;ons, and Lally's known character for re&s;olution, rendered a regular &s;iege unadvi&s;able, and a blockade by &s;ea and land, for
<PB N="167" REF="170">
obvious rea&s;ons, was re&s;olved on. This block|ade was &s;upported and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by proper batteries, which continually harra&s;&s;ed the garri&s;on and were daily, though in&s;en&s;ibly, drawing near to the place, but were incommoded by the rainy weather.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e kind of operations continued for &s;even months, the batteries being &s;ometimes ruined and &s;ometimes repaired by the indefatigable per&s;eve|rance of the Engli&s;h, in both which they were equalled by the French. The Engli&s;h, however, had the comfort to reflect, that, amid&s;t all their hard&s;hips and labours the purpo&s;es of the block|ade were &s;till going on; and that the French with|in the place were reduced to live on dogs, cats, elephants and camels, and that even tho&s;e loath|&s;ome kinds of food mu&s;t, if the blockade continued, fail them in a few days. The French &s;eldom lo&s;e their hopes. They comforted them|&s;elves with the thoughts of being relieved by their fleet; but a &s;torm which happened on the fir&s;t of January 1761, gave them a much better grounded a&s;&s;urance of deliverance. This &s;torm de&s;troyed four Engli&s;h &s;hips of the line and drove the re&s;t from the blockade. Upon this Lally, the day after, wrote a letter to Raymond the French re&s;ident at Pullicat, in which letter he in a manner annihilates the Engli&s;h fleet. His beginning and concluding &s;entences may give the reader &s;ome idea of this General's &s;anguine impetuo&s;ity. He begins, <HI>The Engli&s;h &s;quadron is no more, Sir.</HI> He concludes, <HI>in &s;hort, ri&s;que all, force all, attempt all, and &s;end us &s;ome rice, &s;hould it be but half a gar&s;e at a time.</HI> His hopes were &s;hort lived. In four days after the &s;torm, and before the garri&s;on could receive the &s;malle&s;t &s;upply, Admiral Stevens again appeared before the place and renewed the blockade with 11 &s;hips of the line and a frigate;
<PB N="168" REF="171">
and a large battery was advanced within 450 yards of the rampart.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on had now only three days mi&s;erable provi&s;ion to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on; but this wretchedne&s;s made no impre&s;&s;ion upon the di&s;po&s;ition of Lally. He continued at be&s;t pa&s;&s;ively &s;ullen, pretending, that the Engli&s;h breaches of faith di&s;abled him from treating with them. At la&s;t, however, a &s;ignal for ce&s;&s;ation was made, and the principal of the Je&s;uits with two civilians, but without any apparent authority from the Governor, were &s;ent out to treat with the Engli&s;h. As this deputa|tion had no legal commi&s;&s;ion to treat, the Engli&s;h knew not well how to behave; but being given to under&s;tand that they would meet with no op|po&s;ition from the Governor, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place and all its immen&s;e riches; and thus, excepting the unimportant &s;ettlement of Makie on the coa&s;t of Malabar, which was &s;oon after reduced, the whole trade of the va&s;t penin&s;ula of India, the riche&s;t of any in the known world, fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, through the unparallelled intrepidity and per&s;everance of their officers and &s;oldiers. But we are now to give an account, before we clo&s;e the hi&s;tory of this war, of an internal revolution in India which threat|ened to deprive us of all our amazing &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The famous Timur Beg or Tamerlane, at the head of his &s;avage Moguls, a hideous race, conquered India and its va&s;t penin&s;ula, which he left to a branch of his family. That branch fail|ing, another which was driven out of Buckharia, and from thence to Per&s;ia pa&s;&s;ed the Ind; and &s;uch was the veneration of the inhabitants for a de&s;cendant of Timur Beg, that he mounted the throne of his ance&s;tors under the appellation of the Great Mogul, which is there &s;ynonimous with that of Great Conqueror; and for &s;ome years
<PB N="169" REF="172">
he and his pro&s;perity made u&s;e of none but Mo|gul guards, by which they e&s;tabli&s;hed a mo&s;t un|bounded de&s;poti&s;m over their Indian &s;ubjects. Though neither they nor the Moguls are very nice in matters of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, yet it has been al|ways found nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ucceeding Empe|rors there, ever &s;ince the days of Aureng Zebe, to claim &s;ome kindred with the Timur Beg blood. At the time we now treat of, the Marat|tas were the military force of India, and having depo&s;ed the late Great Mogul, his &s;on Sha Zad|dah a&s;&s;umed that title, but his authority was di&s;|puted by &s;ome provinces. Being &s;upported by Mr. Law a French officer, nephew to the cele|brated Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi Law, at the head of about 200 French fugitives, he made great progre&s;s in a&s;&s;erting his title, and at la&s;t Law per&s;uaded him, at the head of 80,000 of his country troops, and, what he had a much greater dependence on, the 200 French, to march again&s;t the Engli&s;h in Bengal. They were met by 20,000 of the &s;ame country troops and 500 Engli&s;h under the com|mand of Major Carnac, who in a pitched battle entirely defeated them, and made the young Mo|gul, and his General Law, pri&s;oners, the very day on which Pondicherry was &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>The fortune of the Engli&s;h prevailed equally in other parts of India. Jaffier Ali Cawn who had, in the manner already related, been rai&s;ed to the Nabob&s;hip of Bengal, grew intoxicated with his power, even to a kind of phrenzy, which lo&s;t him the protection of the Engli&s;h, who obliged him to re&s;ign his government in favour of his &s;on in law, which he did without re&s;i&s;tance. This new Nabob confirmed and encrea&s;ed the Engli&s;h privileges in Bengal to &s;uch an extent as drew upon them the jealou&s;y of the Dutch, which
<PB N="170" REF="173">
occa&s;ioned &s;ome very di&s;agreeable con&s;equences from an actual inva&s;ion of that country by the Dutch, with a de&s;ign, as is &s;aid, utterly to ex|tirpate the Engli&s;h in Bengal. They were, how|ever, repelled by the valour of the Engli&s;h, and the matter is now under a civil deliberation, which makes it improper for a Martial Review. During tho&s;e tran&s;actions in India the Count D'E&s;taign, a French officer, with no more than two frigates of ordinary force, by his valour, conduct and ac|tivity, reflected reproach upon his countrymen in all other parts of the globe. In October 1759, he de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement of Bender Aba&s;&s;i in the gulph of Per&s;ia. After that, he re|duced Bencoolen in the i&s;le of Sumatra, where we carry on great trade, e&s;pecially in pepper, and ruined all our forts and &s;ettlements there. This enterpri&s;ing adventurer afterwards fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, and has been accu&s;ed of committing all tho&s;e ho&s;tilities while he was there, pri&s;oner on his parole. Though we can &s;ay nothing po&s;itively as to that fact, yet we appre|hend it mu&s;t be either fal&s;e or mi&s;-&s;tated, becau&s;e the Briti&s;h government &s;uffered him to return to France without ran&s;om, and he has, &s;ince the &s;ignature of the late preliminaries, been nominated to their chief command in India. And here we clo&s;e our Review of the war in that country and return to Europe.</P>
<P>During the winter of 1760, and the beginning of 1761, the French winter quarters on the Lower Rhine, in He&s;&s;e, and upon the frontiers of Ha|nover were not only &s;ecure but plentiful; while tho&s;e of the allies were the rever&s;e. Di&s;contents in England concerning the management of the Ger|man war had now ri&s;en to a greater height than ever, and Prince Ferdinand, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="171" REF="174">
rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, drew his troops together on the 9th of November, and began his march in three divi&s;ions. The hereditary Prince and the Marquis of Granby, left the country of He&s;&s;e to the Ea&s;tward, at the head of the right divi&s;ion, General Sporken penetrated into Thuringia with the left, and our German General with the center marched directly towards Ca&s;&s;el. It is incon|ceivable what Prince Ferdinand could mean by &s;uch a plan of bold operations. The French could have no rational expectation of them, and as they were executed with amazing rapidity and &s;pirit, their army was thrown into a con&s;ternati|on, which bore &s;ome &s;ymptoms of a total rout, The hereditary Prince and the Marquis of Gran|by, who were mo&s;t advanced, &s;truck the fir&s;t blow; but the former was repul&s;ed before Fritzlar, and Breidenbach a Hanoverian General lo&s;t his life in attempting to &s;urprize Marbourg; both checks being attended with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s on the part of the allies. Fritzlar, being again attempted by cannon, &s;urrendered on the 15th of February; and the Marquis of Granby, after reducing the adjacent forts, pu&s;hed forward at the head of the Engli&s;h cavalry with &s;o much &s;pirit, that va&s;t ma|gazines of the French fell into the hands of the al|lies, which kept the hor&s;es, perhaps the men, alive in that exhau&s;ted country. The French would gladly have fired tho&s;e magazines, but were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued that they had no time, and they fell back almo&s;t to the Mayne.</P>
<P>Thus far this unintelligible attempt (as was be|fore mentioned) &s;ucceeded beyond any rea&s;onable expectation; but the wi&s;e&s;t heads among&s;t the French officers gave them&s;elves but little concern with regard to the &s;equel. The &s;iege and reco|very of Ca&s;&s;el was Prince Ferdinand's great ob|ject,
<PB N="172" REF="175">
but an object in all probability unattainable at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, as the garri&s;on was extremely &s;trong, and Mar&s;hal Broglio, though he had retreated towards Frankfort, hung over him with a &s;uperior army, and had now recalled to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance the detachments he had &s;ent to the Lower Rhine. Tho&s;e rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the allies, for Sporken was victorious on his &s;ide, led them into many mi&s;takes, for while they were driving the French from their cantonments and weak pa&s;&s;es, they left behind them large tracts of unguarded country, and places provided with garri&s;ons in number and &s;trength almo&s;t equal to armies. All the allies had hitherto acquired was by <HI>coups du main,</HI> but the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el was now regularly formed, and Marpurg and Ziegenhagen blockaded by them, and Prince Ferdinand made &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as was be&s;t &s;uited for carrying on the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el under the direction of the Count of Lippe Schoumbourg, and watched the motions of the Mar&s;hal Broglio. But all tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, however plau&s;ible, were found to be fundamentally wrong. Sporken, though he had been &s;ucce&s;sful, and had driven the French back to Bamberg, had his retreat cut off with con&s;ider|able lo&s;s by the Count de Vaux the French go|vernor of Gottingen, who likewi&s;e took the town of Duder&s;tadt, &s;o that Sporken was obliged to rejoin the main army under Prince Ferdinand, where his pre&s;ence now became nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;trong po&s;ts of Marpurg and Ziegenhagen lay to the rear of the allied army, and in their front they had the collected &s;trength of Mar&s;hal Broglio, and all this while the important &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el was going forward.</P>
<P>Broglio, having laid his plan of operations, at|tacked the advanced parts of the allies under the
<PB N="173" REF="176">
Hereditary Prince near Grunberg, which, con&s;i&s;ting of He&s;&s;ians, Hanoverians, and Brun&s;wickers, whom he entirely routed making 2000 pri&s;oners. Upon receiving this &s;evere blow, the allies abandoned the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, after 27 days open trenches. The blockade of Ziegenhagen was broken up, their other po&s;ts abandoned, and having once more evacuated He&s;&s;e, they fell back upon the Dymel near to their former quarters. Upon the whole, the allies by this unaccountable expedition acquired only &s;omewhat to eat, and could be &s;aid to fight, not &s;o much for territory or glory, as for victuals; and all the good re&s;ulting from it, was, that it co&s;t the French &s;ome time to repair their maga|zines.</P>
<P>An expedition was at this time equipping in England, that if po&s;&s;ible, was more unaccount|able than Prince Ferdinand's irruption into He&s;&s;e. This was again&s;t the wretched barren i&s;land of Bellei&s;le lying on the coa&s;t of France, and upon which, 5000 inhabitants may be &s;aid, rather to breathe, than to live, in mi&s;erable huts. It has, however, a &s;mall fortified city, called Palais, which was defended by a garri&s;on under the Che|valier de Croix. This expedition, again&s;t a place that never could be of u&s;e to England, a&s;toni&s;hed all Europe, as the very expence of the equipment amounted to a greater &s;um than fifty times the value of the fee &s;imple of the whole i&s;land, if &s;old, could have produced. The command of the &s;ea armament was given to Commodore Kep|pel, that of the land to General Hodg&s;on. Our troops, in attempting fir&s;t to land, met with a bloody repul&s;e. On the 25th of April, they made their landing good. The &s;iege of Palais was formed, and after &s;ome di&s;agreeable incidents, which happened to our troops, the place, on the
<PB N="174" REF="177">
7th of June, capitulated. The city of London in compliment to their favourite mini&s;ter, ad|dre&s;&s;ed the King on this occa&s;ion, while, thinking men &s;aw with regret &s;o much Briti&s;h courage, blood, and trea&s;ure, employed on &s;o worthle&s;s an object.</P>
<P>By this time&punc; the negotiations for peace had been &s;et on foot between the courts of London and Ver&s;ailles; and the irruption of Prince Ferdi|nand into He&s;&s;e was no longer a my&s;tery. A ne|gotiation at Aug&s;burgh, for which the plenipo|tentiaries of the belligerent powers had been named, was &s;till depending, but it was fore&s;een, that the variety of their claims and intere&s;ts would either prolong the conferences to an unmea&s;ure|able, and indeed an indefinite, length, or render them entirely fruitle&s;s, and therefore a &s;eparate negotiation between France and England was thought more practicable. Of tho&s;e two powers, the French mini&s;try was unanimous, but in&s;idi|ous; that of England was divided. The French earne&s;ty de&s;ired peace, and would have made al|mo&s;t any conce&s;&s;ions to have obtained it, but the character of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, who maintained his credit by the &s;ucce&s;s and continuance of the war, gave them but &s;mall pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; they therefore turned their eyes to Spain. They repre&s;ented to his Catholic Maje&s;ty, who was him&s;elf extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to adopt the doc|trine, the danger which the hou&s;e of Bourbon was expo&s;ed to, by the prevalence of the Briti&s;h arms, and the unavoidable ruin of the Spani&s;h empire in America, if the war would continue, unle&s;s his Catholic Maje&s;ty would interpo&s;e and take part with France. Charles of Spain, natu|rally inclined to peace, and to the enjoyment of the va&s;t trea&s;ures he was every day ama&s;&s;ing by
<PB N="175" REF="178">
his late &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Spain; but fearing that the Engli&s;h would proceed to the conque&s;t of St. Domingo, and afterwards to that of Mexico and Peru, by which his empire mu&s;t be in a manner annihilated, he with great reluc|tance and &s;ecrecy entered into a treaty with France, which is now well known by the name of the family compact. By this treaty, the con|tracting parties guaranty each others dominions; and each takes a common concern with the other in all matters relating either to peace or war.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;ter &s;hewed more art in di&s;|covering, than he did &s;agacity in preventing, this treaty, by which France was &s;ure of being &s;upplied with money, the only ingredient &s;he wanted for making war, her country being full of men, and the &s;ea&s;ons that year remarkably fa|vourable and fruitful. A &s;mall &s;hare, however, of pliancy, on the part of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, would have prevented his Catholic Maje&s;ty from complying with a mea&s;ure, to which he was &s;o aver&s;e, as that of entering into the war. But from what appears to the public, no &s;tep was taken to make him ea&s;y or to remove his appre|hen&s;ions. On the contrary, after the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter had a moral certainty of the family com|pact being concluded, though not publi&s;hed, he pu&s;hed for an immediate war with Spain without farther ceremony, and for intercepting their trea|&s;ures on the return of their &s;hips to Europe.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned the divi&s;ions of the Engli&s;h admini&s;tration, the &s;tate of which it is now proper to explain. His Maje&s;ty, with equal wi&s;|dom and tenderne&s;s for his people, indulged them in the favourable opinion they had of his mini&s;ter, whom he continued in his po&s;t, but he &s;oon found a total divi&s;ion between him and the re&s;t
<PB N="176" REF="179">
of his council, the Mini&s;ter's brother in law ex|cepted. It will, appear a problem to future times, whether the mini&s;ter had within him a &s;erious con|viction of the expediency, if not nece&s;&s;ity, of de|claring war again&s;t Spain, or whether, fore&s;eeing that &s;uch a mea&s;ure could not be complied with, he made u&s;e of the noncompliance, as a handle for being rid of an admini&s;tration, which he was con&s;cious he could no longer carry on with credit. Be that as it will, it is certain his Maje&s;ty's other mini|&s;ters of all denominations were unanimou&s;ly for opening a negotiation. The mini&s;ter was obliged to &s;eem to comply, but it is pretty plain from the manner of carrying it on, that he was far from being in earne&s;t to complete it. Bu&s;&s;y, who had by office-bu&s;ine&s;s, wriggled him&s;elf into &s;ome con|&s;ideration at the French court, was &s;ent to Lon|don, becau&s;e he had been there before, and had a few paltry connections with the Engli&s;h. The negotiations between him and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter were opened, and at fir&s;t promi&s;ed fair to &s;uc|ceed, but mini&s;terial craft on the one &s;ide, and more than mini&s;terial haughtine&s;s on the other, bla&s;ted them.</P>
<P>Bu&s;&s;y, a low-bred clerk, without abilities to conduct a negotiation that required all the pow|ers of policy, thought it &s;ufficient if he plied the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter with the common places of com|pliments and &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions. The genius of the other di&s;dained tho&s;e mechanical arts, which the court of Ver&s;ailles, and &s;ome, perhaps, at that of St. James's, thought to be e&s;&s;entials. Bu&s;&s;y from the manner and an&s;wers of Mr. P&mdash;might have fore&s;een this; but as his capacity reached no farther than forms, and the &s;ervile ob|&s;ervances of in&s;tructions, he was puzzled, and never was there more weakne&s;s di&s;covered in any
<PB N="177" REF="180">
negotiation, than was manife&s;ted in this, on the part of France, though, perhaps, that court was not alone to blame. It is certain that the French from the commencement of the negotiation treated under the wings of Spain, who&s;e affairs were managed by a mini&s;ter of a &s;till more nar|row capacity, and, if po&s;&s;ible, of a meaner ori|ginal than even Bu&s;&s;y him&s;elf. Being by Birth an Italian, he had been &s;erviceable to his Catholic Maje&s;ty, who employed him in the affairs of Spain, where he found him&s;elf bewildered, but his vanity, impelled, perhaps, by a &s;uperior in|fluence, became at la&s;t his ruling direction. For the court of Madrid mu&s;t make a capital figure; and again&s;t every principle of policy, decency, and indeed common &s;en&s;e, Mr. Bu&s;&s;y was obliged (for in charity we mu&s;t think him &s;o) to pre&s;ent to the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, what he called, a private memorial, intimating that his Catholic Maje&s;ty &s;hould be invited to accede to the guaranty of the treaty, and that his concerns likewi&s;e &s;hould be included in ths negotiation. Tho&s;e were com|prized under three heads. Fir&s;t, &s;atisfaction for Spani&s;h captures made by the Engli&s;h flag, for which there was little or no colour of complaint. Secondly, the claim of the Spaniards to fi&s;h upon the banks of Newfoundland, a claim of which the foundation of it is a &s;ecret; and we are glad that we can oblige the public with &s;ome account of it.</P>
<P>Newfoundland is not the mo&s;t inviting country in the world, and has occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal hands. Nothing is more indi&s;putable, than that the original right of it, by di&s;covery, belonged to the crown of England, &s;o far back as the reign of Henry the 7th. But the climate was &s;o uninviting, that the Engli&s;h, though they
<PB N="178" REF="181">
never made any formal ce&s;&s;ion of it, about the year 1570, neglected it &s;o greatly that the Bi&s;cay|ners, or, as they are called, the Guipu&s;coans, for the benefit of the Spani&s;h lent-ob&s;ervers, fi&s;hed on the banks of Newfoundland, and other|wi&s;e carried on a con&s;iderable trade there in furs and &s;kins, till in the year 1579, the Engli&s;h re-a&s;&s;erted their right to the place, and in the year 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, a Devon&s;hire gen|tleman, took an exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by a commi&s;&s;ion under Queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e facts are inconte&s;table, the Spaniards never lo&s;t &s;ight of the right of pa&s;|turage they pretended to on this &s;ea-common, the mo&s;t fertile and profitable of any in the world. They mentioned it at the treaty of Utrecht, where it was not thought worthy of a &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and it remained dormant till, to the amazement of the world, it was revived in the negotiation at London in the year 1761, between Mr. Pitt and Mr. Bu&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>The third claim that Spain entered on this oc|ca&s;ion was rea&s;onable and well founded, and it regarded the logwood trade on the bay of Cam|peachy. This trade had been long an object of conte&s;t, and a report of the Engli&s;h board of trade, in 1718, had given the Engli&s;h as good a right to it as the Spaniards. The latter, how|ever, never was &s;atisfied with this report, and to &s;ay the truth, the foundation of it was a little more than dubious. As the Engli&s;h, however, had been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that trade, the court of Spain was willing to allow them the benefit, but not the right, of pre&s;cription, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the demolition of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements and for|tifications, that had been erected on the bay of Honduras, upon Spani&s;h territory.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="182">
Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of this famous &s;ecret memorial, which the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter treated with an indignation and contempt, beyond, perhaps, what a Burleigh or a Wal&s;ingham would have ex|pre&s;&s;ed. The event was, that though the nego|tiation &s;till went on with a variety of altercations and conce&s;&s;ions, the particulars of which are fo|reign to this work, yet it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the treaty mu&s;t, in the end, prove abortive, if Mr. P&mdash;continued to have the &s;ole direction of it. This produced many &s;trong debates in the cabinet, where Bu&s;&s;y's conduct was totally con|demned, e&s;pecially as a per&s;on of quality and con&s;ideration then re&s;ided at London, as an Am|ba&s;&s;ador from his Catholic Maje&s;ty, who, how|ever, ordered that mini&s;ter to ju&s;tify all that Bu&s;|&s;y had done; but in a manner that might give as little offence as po&s;&s;ible to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. There is even &s;ome rea&s;on for believing, that if the court of Ver&s;ailles did not di&s;approve of Bu&s;&s;y's proceedings, they, at lea&s;t, were &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, his Britannic Maje&s;ty's privy council, and all his other mini&s;ters did not think that this faux pas was of con&s;equence enough to blow up the whole negotiation. The &s;pirit with which Mr. P&mdash;acted was now known to the public, and &s;o much applauded, that he was then become more popular than ever. He therefore, backed by his brother in law, renewed his efforts for a war with Spain. The point was debated &s;olemnly and &s;eriou&s;ly, and threw the re&s;t of the King's &s;ervants into great perplexities. His Maje&s;ty di&s;covered a vi&s;ible backwardne&s;s to the propo&s;ition, which was likewi&s;e oppo&s;ed by the other mini&s;ters, while the mini&s;ter's influ|ence with the public was &s;o great, that, could they have avoided it, they would not have
<PB N="180" REF="183">
broken with him; but at la&s;t &s;uch a breach be|came nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We do not hazard too bold a conjecture, when we &s;ay, that &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity was mutual. The mini&s;ter grew every day more and more con|vinced that he could not carry on the war, and that his manners were di&s;gu&s;ting to his fellow coun&s;ellors, and, therefore, he wanted but a pre|text for breaking with them. The wi&s;er and the more &s;edate part of the latter, were &s;ecretly re|&s;olved upon peace, and, let the con&s;equences be what they would, to take out of his hands a nego|tiation, which, it was plain, he never intended, &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful, for he was even heard to complain of his being forced into the few preli|minary conce&s;&s;ions he had already made to France, and which the public &s;eemed to di&s;like; &s;o very tender he was of his popularity. It was not long before they met each other half way; for the ne|gotiation between England and France took a new turn. The latter refu&s;ed to abandon their allies in Germany, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titu|tion of the captures made at &s;ea before the decla|ration of war. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try were highly &s;en&s;ible that their ob&s;tinacy was in a great mea|&s;ure owing to the encouragement they had re|ceived from Spain, and re&s;olved to break off the negotiation, as they could find no other means of taking it out of Mr. P&mdash;'s hands. Mr. Stanley, who had negotiated the Briti&s;h affairs at Paris, was recalled from thence, as Bu&s;&s;y was from London; but &s;till Mr. P&mdash;kept in his hands the direction of the war, and now matters came to a cri&s;is. He continued to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate declaration of war with Spain, and his arguments were plau&s;ible and popular. They were grounded upon the danger of the family|compact,
<PB N="181" REF="184">
the provocations which Spain had already given to Great Britain, upon the practicability of intercepting their We&s;t-India trea&s;ures; and he endeavoured to &s;hew that we could, with very lit|tle more expence, carry on the war again&s;t both powers, than what it co&s;t us &s;ingly again&s;t France.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's other mini&s;ters differed from him for many prudential con&s;iderations, but agreed with him in acting with firmne&s;s and &s;pirit, if Spain, after proper repre&s;entations being made, &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in joining France. They in&s;i&s;ted upon the general connections which England ought always to have with the Spani&s;h Monarchy; that an attempt to intercept their trea&s;ures was not only precarious, but would render all the re&s;t of Europe either our open or &s;ecret enemies, and though &s;ucce&s;sful, would hurt our&s;elves more than any other nation. Upon the whole, the &s;en&s;e of the council was to apply, previous to a breach with Spain, every wi&s;e but vigorous expe|dient to prevent it. The mini&s;ter, upon tho&s;e and other arguments ari&s;ing from the inability of the nation to maintain a general war, declared, that as he was called to his po&s;t by the voice of the people, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as their mini&s;ter; and that he was re&s;olved to retire from all public bu&s;ine&s;s, if his mea&s;ures were not followed by an immediate declaration of war again&s;t Spain. His &s;peech was re&s;ented by the other Coun&s;ellors, and by none more than the Earl of Granville, Pre&s;ident of the council, who had always been noted when out, as well as when in power, for the vigour, if not the violence, of his mea&s;ures; and the words of his an&s;wer, the authenticity of which &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, are &s;aid to have been as follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">I find the gentleman is determined
<PB N="182" REF="185">
to leave us, nor can I &s;ay I am &s;orry for it, &s;ince he would otherwi&s;e have certainly compelled us to leave him; but, if he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the right of advi&s;ing his Maje&s;ty, and directing the operations of the war, to what purpo&s;e are we called to this council? when he talks of being re&s;pon&s;ible to the people, he talks the language of the hou&s;e of commons, and forgets, that at this board, he is only repon&s;ible to the King. However, though he may po&s;&s;ibly have con|vinced him&s;elf of his infallibility, &s;till it re|mains that we &s;hould be equally convinced, before we can reign our under&s;tandings to his direction, or join with him in the mea&s;ure he propo&s;es.</Q> This &s;peech was, from the ac|quie&s;cence and approbation it met with from all the re&s;t of the council con&s;idered as their &s;en&s;e; and their opinion was honoured with the counte|nance of the greate&s;t character in the nation, who declared, that had his council been as unanimous in following, as they were in rejecting, his mini|&s;ters &s;entiments, he would have found him&s;elf un|der great difficulties. Soon after Mr. P&mdash;and his brother in law re&s;igned their places, and with|in a day or two the London Gazette announced Mr. P&mdash;'s re&s;ignation and that his Maje&s;ty had, in con&s;ideration of his great &s;ervices &s;ettled upon him a pen&s;ion of 3000l. a year for three lives; and that the title of an Engli&s;h barony was con|ferred upon his lady and her i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Had the government of England been threat|ened with immediate di&s;&s;olution, it could not have created a more general con&s;ternation, than this re&s;ignation did in the minds of the public; but a little reflection &s;oon recovered them. It was remembered, that the Mini&s;ter's late continental mea&s;ures were direct violations of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;i|ons,
<PB N="183" REF="186">
for which the voice of the people had called him to power. That, by accepting the pen&s;ion and the title, he laid him&s;elf under the tacit obligations of honour and gratitude, not to di&s;|tre&s;s, and even not to oppo&s;e, his Maje&s;ty's mea|&s;ures; and many went &s;o far as to &s;ay, that he had exchanged his power for the pen&s;ion and the title; and had in fact bartered away the intere&s;ts of the people. Though the la&s;t accu&s;ation again&s;t him was certainly unju&s;t and groundle&s;s; yet it had its weight with many zealots, who think they never can be wrong if they oppo&s;e a court. Other con&s;iderations had their weight with more &s;en&s;ible people. The Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, at the court of Spain, gave great hopes, that his Ca|tholic Maje&s;ty's mini&s;try inclined to avoid the war, and to &s;ettle matters by an amicable accom|modation. Men of &s;en&s;e and reflection could not conceive that it became any mini&s;ter to a&s;|&s;ume to him&s;elf a dictatorial power at his Ma|je&s;ty's council-board, that was equally uncon&s;ti|tutional as in&s;olent; and they were confirmed in this opinion by the following letter, which was publi&s;hed as authentic in the Public Ledger, and which never was di&s;owned to be &s;uch, either by the mini&s;ter or his friends.</P>

<P>Finding to my great &s;urprize, that the cau&s;e and manner of my re&s;igning the &s;eals, is gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented in the city, as well as that the mo&s;t gracious and <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> marks of his Maje&s;ty's approbation of my &s;ervices, which marks followed my re&s;ignation, have been in|famou&s;ly traduced as a bargain for my for&s;aking
<PB N="184" REF="187">
the public. I am under a nece&s;&s;ity of declaring the truth of both the&s;e facts, in a manner which I am &s;ure no gentleman will contradict. A difference of opinion, with regard to mea|&s;ures to be taken again&s;t Spain, of the highe&s;t importance to the honour of the crown, and to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential national intere&s;ts, (and this, founded on what Spain had already done, not on what court may further intend to do) was the cau&s;e of my re&s;igning the &s;eals. Lord Temple and I &s;ubmitted in writing, and &s;igned by us, our mo&s;t humble &s;entiments to his Ma|je&s;ty; which being over-ruled by the united opinion of all the re&s;t of the King's &s;ervants, I re&s;igned the &s;eals on Monday the 5th of this month, in order not to remain re&s;pon&s;ible for mea&s;ures, which I was no longer allowed to guide. Mo&s;t gracious public marks of his Maje&s;ty's approbation of my &s;ervices followed my re&s;ignation, they are unmerited and un|&s;ollicited, and I &s;hall ever be proud to have received them from the be&s;t of &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>I will now only add, my dear Sir, that I have explained the&s;e matters only for the ho|nour of truth, not in any view to court return of confidence from any man, who, with a credulity as weak as it is injurious, has thought fit ha&s;tily to withdraw his good opinion from one, who has &s;erved his country with fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s; and who ju&s;tly reveres the up|right and candid judgment of it; little &s;ollici|tous about the cen&s;ures of the caprici|ous and the ungenerous, accept of my &s;incere&s;t acknowledgements for all your kind friend|&s;hip, and believe me ever, with truth and e&s;teem,</P>

<P><PB N="185" REF="188">
The mini&s;ter's conduct was generally con|demned, not &s;o much for the matter contained in the letter (as was before mentioned) as for the manner in which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; and &s;ome con&s;trued it as a di&s;re&s;pectful appeal to the pub|lic from the crown, after the almo&s;t unparallelled obligations he lay under to his Maje&s;ty. The wording of the letter, to &s;ay the be&s;t of it, was certainly incautious, and his a&s;&s;ailants from the pre&s;s had &s;o greatly the advantage of him, that a mighty breach was made in his popularity. He was now blamed by &s;ome of his be&s;t friends for the conce&s;&s;ions he had made to France in his ne|gotiation with Bu&s;&s;y; and all that could be urged in the abatement of the charge, was, that he had been forced into tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions. The reply was ready. If he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be ravi&s;hed in the one ca&s;e, why not in the other? Why was he &s;o uncomplying with Spain and &s;o very tame with France?</P>
<P>The Earl of E&mdash;was appointed &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate in his room, and the new mini&s;try gave out, that they were re&s;olved to proceed with the &s;ame, if not greater, firmne&s;s, both with re|gard to France and Spain, as Mr. P&mdash;had done. It &s;oon appeared that the latter had &s;ent very pro|per in&s;tructions to the Earl of Bri&s;tol, his Bri|tannic Maje&s;ty's Amba&s;&s;ador at the Spani&s;h court, and that his Lord&s;hip had executed them with great abilities and punctuality. He gave Mr. Wall the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, to under&s;tand, that the Briti&s;h court entirely rejected the claim of the Spaniards upon part of the Newfoundland fi&s;hery. That the Spani&s;h captures, complained of, mu&s;t be adjudged by the courts of Admiralty and appeal in England, and that the right of cutting logwood in the bay of Honduras never
<PB N="186" REF="189">
would be given up on the part of Great Britain Wall di&s;claimed all intention that the court of Madrid had to offend that of London by the me|morial pre&s;ented by Bu&s;&s;y, but intimated, that the engagements entered into by both courts, and the advantages offered by France to Spain, had cemented their intere&s;ts. He refu&s;ed explicitly to give up any of the claims of Spain, but in&s;i|nuatd that, in the main point of di&s;pute between them, the logwood trade, the intere&s;t of England, might be gratified, provided the honour of his Catholic Maje&s;ty was con&s;ulted by a demolition of the &s;ettlements, which the Briti&s;h had forcibly made in that bay, and complained of the tri|fling the Engli&s;h had made u&s;e of in that impor|tant point, during a &s;ix years negotiation upon it. The new Briti&s;h mini&s;try gave &s;ome ear to his an&s;wers. But the intere&s;ts of the French court, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a general opinion, that Great Britain was unable longer to carry on the war, prevailed. In the mean while, the war in Ger|many took an unfavourable turn for England; the Spani&s;h Flota arrived &s;afe in their ports; and his Catholic Maje&s;ty highly re&s;ented the indig|nant manner in which the offer of his medation had been treated by the late Briti&s;h mini&s;ter; and then the connections between France and Spain, by the family-compact were openly avowed. The Earl of Bri&s;tol's in&s;tructions from the new Bri|ti&s;h mini&s;try, was to demand, in a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate but earne&s;t, manner, an immediate and categori|cal an&s;wer, whether &s;uch a treaty, as public fame reported, exi&s;ted between Spain and France, and whether Spain would a&s;&s;i&s;t France in a war with Great Britain.</P>
<P>The Earl of Bri&s;tol was &s;ufficiently apprized of the truth, but punctually performed his in&s;truc|tions,
<PB N="187" REF="190">
and then Mr. Wall, who &s;eems, on this occa&s;ion, to have been under &s;ome controul, en|tirely altered his language and behaviour, and ac|knowledged, that his Catholic Maje&s;ty con&s;ider|ed the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of England in America as &s;o many preludes to his own ruin, and that he was re&s;olved to be no longer pa&s;&s;ive. All the rea&s;on|ings which the Briti&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador urged for a further explanation, was in vain, and he received new in&s;tructions to declare that if the Spaniards did not di&s;avow their intentions to a&s;&s;i&s;t France, the court of England would con&s;ider &s;uch a refu|&s;al as a declaration of war. Mr. Wall's lan|guage, was, if po&s;&s;ible, more haughty than be|fore. He &s;aid, that war had been declared by the &s;pirit of pride and di&s;cord reigning in the Engli&s;h government, and the attack they had made on his Catholic Maje&s;ty's dignity; and that the Earl of Bri&s;tol might depart when and in what manner he thought proper. His Lord&s;hip accordingly immediately retired from Madrid, December 17, 1761, and the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;a|dor in like manner took leave of London.</P>
<P>Soon after, declarations of war were publi&s;hed by the courts of London and Madrid, and its operations &s;eemed to threaten a general conflagra|tion in the con&s;equences. During the negotia|tion, both parties thought they would get the bet|ter terms of peace, the more vigorou&s;ly they car|ried on war; but the French in this re&s;pect had a va&s;t &s;uperiority; for though the allies had great|ly incommoded and retarded them by burning their magazines, yet the defeat of the Hereditary Prince at Stangerode, their rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, the evacuation of the country of He&s;&s;e, the lo&s;&s;es and fatigues they had &s;uffered, and va|rious other untowardly accidents, having obliged
<PB N="188" REF="191">
them to repa&s;s the Dymel, the French, in the mean while, recruited both their magazines and armies. The month of June, however, was far advanced, before Broglio could draw his forces to the field from Ca&s;&s;el and its neighbourhood, when he moved towards the Dymel to join Sou|bi&s;e. General Sporken was po&s;ted &s;o with a &s;trong detachment in the front of the allied army, as to be able to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age of the Dymel; but, on the advance of Broglio, he attempted to retire, though with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, for be&s;ides the killed, 800 were made pri&s;oners, 19 pieces of cannon, 400 hor&s;es, and above 170 waggons were taken by the enemy. The allies endeavoured to extenuate this lo&s;s, but it appeared too plain, by the French pa&s;&s;ing the Dymel and &s;eizing War|burg, Dringleburg, and Paderborn, and by Prince Ferdinand falling back upon the Lippe and taking po&s;t between Ham and Lip&s;tadt, by which he was in hopes of cutting off Soubi&s;e's communication with the Rhine. The allies being thus advan|tageou&s;ly po&s;ted, Broglio dur&s;t not march to|wards Hanover, but re&s;olved, after he had joined the Prince de Soubi&s;e, which he did at Soe&s;t, to attack the allied army. Their di&s;po&s;itions &s;oon convinced Prince Ferdinand of their intention, and he called in all his parties. His fir&s;t care was to &s;ecure the communication between Lip|&s;tadt and Ham, and his left wing took po&s;t be|tween the Lippe and the Aa&s;t. The body of the army occupied the height of Wambeln, and the Prince of Anhalt the ground between Illingen and Hohenover. Lord Granby kept this po&s;ition upon the heights of Kirch-Denkern, and Lieu|tenant General Wulgenau, who was encamped upon the heath of Untrup, marched by his right to approach the village of Kirch-Denkern. The
<PB N="189" REF="192">
avenues and po&s;ts on the little rivers Aa&s;t, and Sultzbach, were guarded by the piquets of the army. While tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were planning, on the 15th of July, at &s;ix in the evening, the enemy di&s;lodged Lord Granby's advanced po&s;ts, and attacked his camp in a &s;trong body. It had been before concerted, that Wulgenau &s;hould &s;upport him, and Prince Ferdinand ordered the Marquis to maintain his ground to the la&s;t extre|mity, till he was joined by Wulgenau, which his Lord&s;hip did &s;o gallantly, that, notwith&s;tanding the fury of the French attack and their &s;uperio|rity of numbers, the enemy was repul&s;ed, the battle having continued till it was quite dark.</P>
<P>Next morning at three o'clock, the battle be|gan a fre&s;h, and Wulgenau's corps appeared to be the chief object of the French, who&s;e right was commanded by Broglio, as their center and left were by Soubi&s;e. The firing continued very hot for five hours, without the enemy obtaining any advantage. About nine the French &s;eemed inclined to erect a battery on an expo&s;ed emi|nence, which commanded the Marquis of Gran|by's camp; upon which, Prince Ferdinand, af|ter ordering a body of re&s;erve under Sporken to advance, which they did, commanded an imme|diate attack, before the enemy could re&s;olve on what to do. They re&s;olved on a flight, and their right wing retired with precipitation, their cen|ter and left, which never, properly &s;peaking, had been engaged, otherwi&s;e than by a cannonade from the other &s;ide of the Sulzbach, followed the example of their right, and thus the allies re|mained ma&s;ters of the field of battle, but the na|ture of the ground not &s;uffering their cavalry to act, they were obliged &s;oon to di&s;continue the pur&s;uit. The enemy left their dead and wounded
<PB N="190" REF="193">
with &s;ome pieces of cannon; and Maxwell's &s;in|gle battalion of grenadiers took the regiment of Rouze, con&s;i&s;ting of four battalions, with its can|non and colours. Upon the whole, the lo&s;s of the French in killed wounded and pri&s;oners, was &s;aid to be 5000, while that of the allies amounted only to 300 killed, 1000 wounded, and 200 taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>It happened during the cour&s;e of this war, by a &s;eeming fatality, that the defeats the French received, &s;erved, upon the whole, to advance their affairs. It is true, Broglio and Soubi&s;e endea|voured to throw upon one another the blame of the late di&s;grace they had received at Kirch-Den|kern. The former accu&s;ed the latter of being too late, and the latter the former of being too precipitate, in the attack, but their &s;ervice did not &s;uffer. Their lo&s;s of men was &s;oon repaired, that of the allies was irreparable. Their army again divided; Soubi&s;e at the head of one part of it cro&s;&s;ed the Lippe, intending to be&s;iege Mun&s;ter, as Broglio's divi&s;ion did the We&s;er, with a &s;eem|ing intention to penetrate into Hanover. The allied General was obliged to follow their exam|ple; he him&s;elf ob&s;erved the motions of Broglio, while the Hereditary Prince was &s;ent to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er Mun&s;ter. Broglio avoided a battle, but many &s;kirmi&s;hes happened, in one of which, the brave young Prince Henry of Brun&s;wick brother to the Hereditary Prince, was mortally wounded. Tho&s;e actions were generally in favour of the allies, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es were owing to the bravery of the Briti&s;h troops under the Marquis of Granby. The French received a con&s;iderable check near Warburg, and might then have fought on equal terms, but they &s;till declined it, as if their inten|tion had been to wa&s;te the allied troops by &s;kir|mi&s;hes
<PB N="191" REF="194">
and fatigues, in which they &s;ucceeded but too well. Mean while, the Hereditary Prince, &s;eeing Soubi&s;e more in earne&s;t to be&s;iege Mun|&s;ter, than Broglio was to march into Hanover, attacked Dor&s;ten on the 30th of Augu&s;t, and obliged the garri&s;on to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. Upon this, Soubi&s;e gave over thoughts of be|&s;ieging Mun&s;ter and retired from the Lippe. Prince Ferdinand, on the other hand, &s;eemed to threaten, by advancing into He&s;&s;e, to &s;top all &s;upplies from that country to Broglio's army; up|on which the latter returned to He&s;&s;e, as the Prince did to Paderborn. After this, the Heredi|tary Prince, who had rejoined his uncle, made an irruption into He&s;&s;e, and de&s;troyed the ene|my's magazines as far as Fritzlar; while Brog|lio, on the 25th of October, entered the fore&s;t of Hartz, where he took and de&s;troyed the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Schartzels and levied &s;evere contributi|ons on a large tract of country; but the allies received a &s;till more con&s;iderable check by Prince Xavier of Saxony taking Wolfenbuttel after five days bombardment. The French then drove the reigning Prince of Brun&s;wick from his capital to Hamburgh, where he met the reigning Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, who was under the like unfortu|nate circum&s;tances. Prince Ferdinand, per|ceiving the uninterrupted progre&s;s of the French to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, di&s;patched his ne|phew the Hereditary Prince to relieve Brun&s;wick, which was now inve&s;ted by Prince Xavier. The Hereditary Prince, being joined by General Luck|ner, who was detached with the cavalry towards Pein, attacked the enemy, drove them out of their entrenchments, and forced them, not only to rai&s;e their &s;iege, but precipitately to abandon Wolfenbuttel with a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s of men and cannon.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="195">
The French were not &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in We&s;t|phalia, which the Prince Soubi&s;e ravaged, and where, after taking O&s;nabourg, he gave that city and its mi&s;erable inhabitants up to the pillage of his &s;oldiers. About the &s;ame time, a body of French light troops appeared before Embden, which was garri&s;oned by no more than 200 Bri|ti&s;h invalids, whom the inhabitants refu&s;ed to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in defending the place, and which was given up, after capitulating for favourable treatment. This capitulation was infamou&s;ly broken, and the French, not only put that city, but the great|e&s;t part of Ea&s;t Frie&s;land under the mo&s;t uncon|&s;cionable contributions. Tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions proved in the end as impolitic as they were unju&s;t, for they exa&s;perated the boors of the country &s;o much that they took up arms, and drove the French out of Embden. In the mean while, the Prince of Cond&eacute; with another detachment of Soubi&s;e's army, took Mappen, a place of &s;ome con&s;e|quence, on the Ems, where the allies had &s;ome magazines. They had, however, far more con|&s;iderable ones in Bremen, a city of the ut|mo&s;t importance by its &s;ituation on the We&s;er, becau&s;e from it the Engli&s;h were &s;upplied with all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The French attempted to enter it, but were repul&s;ed, and the garri&s;on, which was before but &s;mall, was reinforced. As to the re&s;t of the operations in We&s;tphalia and He&s;&s;e this year, they were various, bri&s;k, and greatly to the honour of the allied officers, par|ticularly the Marquis of Granby and the other Engli&s;h Generals. But the French being &s;o nu|merous, though they were beaten in almo&s;t every encounter, nothing deci&s;ive followed upon them; and therefore the nature of our de&s;ign does not &s;uffer us to particularize them. It is &s;ufficient to
<PB N="193" REF="196">
&s;ay, that the Hereditary Prince po&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o as to &s;ecure the coa&s;t of the We&s;er, and ince&s;|&s;antly alarmed the French by detachments, till the enemy went into winter quarters, as he him|&s;elf did &s;oon after. His head quarters were fixed at Hilder&s;heim; tho&s;e of the Hereditary Prince at Mun&s;ter. The Briti&s;h cavalry wintered in Ea&s;t Frie&s;land and their infantry in the bi&s;ho|pric of O&s;nabourg, while the French quartered 20,000 troops in the country of He&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Though the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, during their ne|gotiation with France, had refu&s;ed to abandon his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, yet the very treating on &s;uch a point gave him apprehen&s;ions, and his in|telligence was too good for him not to fore&s;ee, that England would &s;oon alter her &s;y&s;tem with re|gard to him. He therefore re&s;olved to act on the defen&s;ive. He had an army under Prince Henry &s;trongly entrenched at Leip&s;ic in Saxony. Daun was encamped near Dre&s;den, as his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty was near Schweidnitz. General Tottleben led one divi&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ian army towards Po|merania, as Butterlin did another into the Upper Sile&s;ia, where, being joined by Laudohn, all that country was laid under &s;evere contributions. About the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, a body of Ru&s;&s;ians ap|peared before Bre&s;lau, which they cannonaded, but all the various arts, marches and counter|marches of Laudohn, could not draw his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty from his advantageous &s;ituation. In Pomerania, Tottleben lo&s;t his command for &s;e|cretly corre&s;ponding with his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty; and was &s;ucceeded by General Romanzow, who formed the &s;iege of the important town of Col|berg by land, while a fleet of 40 &s;hips at|tacked it by &s;ea. The place however had been lately fortified, and the Prince of Wirtemberg,
<PB N="194" REF="197">
a Pru&s;&s;ian General, was entrenched under its cannon with 6 or 7000 men. To &s;ave Colberg, the key of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's dominions on the north, he detached General Platen to de&s;troy the Ru&s;&s;ian magazines in Poland, and then to continue his march towards Pomerania. Platen performed the &s;ervice with great &s;ucce&s;s, and the Ru&s;&s;ians, to pre&s;erve their remaining magazines, without which they knew they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, left Sile&s;ia and returned to Poland. From thence, after &s;ecuring his magazines, Butterlin carried fire and &s;word into the Marche of Brandenburgh, and directed his cour&s;e towards Pomerania. All his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty could do, was, to detach Ge|neral Knoblock after him, that he and Platen might di&s;tre&s;s their convoys.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, by this time, began to be in want of provi&s;ions in the &s;trong camp he &s;till pre&s;erved near Schweidnitz, and made a motion towards the Oder, thinking him&s;elf &s;o &s;ecure of Schweid|nitz, that he had withdrawn 4000 of his garri|&s;on. Laudohn &s;iezed the critical moment with the greate&s;t rapidity, yet caution. His troops ad|vanced to the four quarters of the town; clap|ped their &s;caling ladders to its walls, and a ma|gazine blowing up, became ma&s;ter of the place. About 3000 Pru&s;&s;ians in garri&s;on were made pri|&s;oners on this occa&s;ion, with the Governor, Lieu|tenant General Za&s;trow, and large &s;tores both of artillery and meal fell into the hands of the conqueror, who effected this amazing <HI>coup de main</HI> with the lo&s;s of no more than 600 men, of whom 300, with as many Pru&s;&s;ians, were killed by the blowing up of the magazine. His Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty behaved with his u&s;ual firmne&s;s under this heavy blow. "It is fatal, &s;aid he, but we mu&s;t en|deavour to remedy it". His letter to General
<PB N="195" REF="198">
Za&s;trow was as follows, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">We may now &s;ay, what Francis the Fir&s;t of France wrote to his mother, after the battle of Pavia. We have lo&s;t all except our honour. As I cannot com|prehend what hath happened to you, I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend my judgment, the thing is very extra|ordinary.</Q></P>
<P>Colberg &s;till continued to make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, but General Platen, who had joined the Prince of Wirtemberg, in endeavouring to open a way for the Pru&s;&s;ian reinforcements under Knoblock, was beaten by Romanzow; upon which, Knoblock, with 2000 men under his command, &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. A &s;torm had driven the fleets of Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden from their &s;tation before Colberg; but that procured the place no relief, and it was now vi&s;ible that famine and the Ru&s;&s;ians, who&s;e num|bers amounted to 50,000 men, mu&s;t force it to &s;urrender. This was &s;o much the opinion of the Prince of Wirtemberg, that he broke through the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and left Colberg to make its own terms; and its brave Governor Heyde, after a noble defence of &s;ix months, with his garri&s;on, became pri&s;oners of war. The Ru&s;&s;ians, by taking Colberg, which fell into their hands December 16, were now ma&s;ters of the Baltic; and were no longer under a nece&s;&s;ity of depending upon precarious &s;upplies of provi&s;ion from Poland, while his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;eemed now undone beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of recovery, when all of a &s;udden he was relieved from the bittere&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es he had ever yet experienced by the death of his mo&s;t determined enemy the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, which happened &s;oon after he lo&s;t Colberg.</P>
<P>The critical and indeed providential event was as fortunate for Great Britain as it was for his
<PB N="196" REF="199">
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. The court of Vienna at f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t affected to give out, that the new Emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia would pur&s;ue the &s;y&s;tem of the late Em|pre&s;s, but a few days undeceived the public. Mutual Emba&s;&s;ies pa&s;&s;ed between the two courts of Peter&s;burgh and Berlin, and Czernichef, the Ru&s;&s;ian General in Sile&s;ia, having orders to re|treat towards Poland, began his march accord|ingly. Soon after, it was publickly known, that his Imperial Maje&s;ty of Ru&s;&s;ia was determined totally to rever&s;e the maxims of his immediate predece&s;&s;or, and an entire ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities between the two courts &s;oon after took place.</P>
<P>The court of Great Britain, who had hither|to been hampered between its own intere&s;ts and the ties of honour due to the di&s;tre&s;t &s;ituation of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, &s;eeing with plea&s;ure that he was ea&s;ied of the weight, which, ever &s;ince the commencement of the war, had turned its &s;cale again&s;t him, began now &s;eriou&s;ly to think of de|livering it&s;elf from the heavy burden of his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty's &s;ub&s;idy. There was the greater rea&s;on for this, as we were now, in fact, entering upon two fre&s;h wars, one by &s;ea, and another by land, but both again&s;t Spain, who had already marched their troops towards Portugal. The grounds of this inva&s;ion were as infamous as any that hi&s;tory can produce. Neither France nor Spain &s;o much as alledged any provocation that had been given them by the King of Portugal, and they attacked him for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he would not break with Great Britain, by ac|ceding to the family-compact. The Pru&s;&s;ian mi|ni&s;ters, both in Germany and England, made a great noi&s;e when it was intimated to them that their ma&s;ter's &s;ub&s;idy would be no longer paid; but as neither they nor their ma&s;ter had a &s;hadow

of complaint of failure in engagements by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, the affair, as we &s;ay, went off. In the mean while, the good effects which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty reaped from the friend&s;hip of his Imperial Maje&s;ty of Ru&s;&s;ia daily appeared, for a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities was concluded between the troops of Pru&s;&s;ia and Sweden, while the Spani|ards were redoubling their preparations by &s;ea and land to invade Portugal, and even threatened Gibraltar it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The defection of Ru&s;&s;ia from the Imperial and French courts damped neither of tho&s;e powers. In Germany, the French made preparations for bringing into the field, the next campaign, 140,000 troops. Tho&s;e of her Imperial Maje&s;ty were equal, and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty augmented his army to 150,000 men; but it is now time to attend the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in Ame|rica. Next to the conque&s;t of Quebec, that of Martinico was thought to be of the greate&s;t con|&s;equence to England, and &s;ome thought that it even ought to have the preference on many ac|counts. Great difficulties had been fore&s;een in completing the undertaking, ari&s;ing chiefly from the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the former attempts upon that i&s;land, and our ignorance of its &s;trength and &s;i|tuation. When it was determined the conque&s;t of it &s;hould be attempted, General Monkton was appointed to the command of the land forces, as Rear Admiral Rodney was to that of the &s;ea. On the 5th of January, 1762, the whole armament moved from Barbadoes, and, on the 7th, anchored at St. Anne's bay in Martinico. When our troops landed, they found the i&s;land full of gul|lies that were difficult of acce&s;s, guarded by bat|teries and redoubts, and them&s;elves precluded from all intelligence, &s;o that the conque&s;t of the
<PB N="198" REF="201">
i&s;land appeared to be a matter of great difficulty. The enemy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two &s;trong po&s;ts, to|gether with Mont Tarten&s;on leading to Fort Royale; but being beaten from both, by the va|lour of the Briti&s;h troops, they retired to Mont Garnier, a po&s;t &s;o &s;trong, that they thought it im|pregnable. They were, however, driven from it by the Briti&s;h grenadiers, and after that, they were beaten from po&s;t to po&s;t till the citadel of Fort Royale was &s;urrendered, and La Touche, the French Governor, after leaving a garri&s;on in Fort Royale, retired to St. Pierre, and then the whole i&s;land of Martinico &s;urrendered by capitu|lation to the Briti&s;h arms, on the 7th of Febru|ary. This conque&s;t was followed by the reduc|tion of the i&s;le of Grenada, by Commodore Swanton, and Brigadier General Wal&s;h, which was effected without the lo&s;s of a man. Tho&s;e amazing &s;ucce&s;&s;es did great &s;ervice to the reputa|tion of the new Briti&s;h mini&s;try; and ju&s;tified the promi&s;es they had made, that the re&s;ignation of the late mini&s;ter &s;hould rather forward than retard the pro&s;ecution of the war, but they had a &s;till greater object in view, which was no le&s;s than the conque&s;t of the Havannah it&s;elf; an undertaking &s;o arduous, that Britons alone could have thought of it. The honour of this bold project was di&s;|puted by &s;ome of the partizans of the late mi|ni&s;try; but the merit of carrying it into execu|tion, undoubtedly, was due to the new one. They thought a peace de&s;ireable, and that nothing could bring it about &s;o effectually as a blow that might di&s;able both France and Spain from carry|ing on the war.</P>
<P>As no mea&s;ure ever was entered into with a more general approbation of the public, &s;o the mini&s;ter very hone&s;tly and very wi&s;ely united the
<PB N="199" REF="202">
cabinet in the &s;ame &s;entiments. The nomina|tion of the chief land officers, and the operations of the expedition, were left to a royal per&s;onage, who was an excellent judge of both, and the Earl of Albermarle was pitched upon to be com|mander in chief of the army, as Sir George Po|cock was of the fleet. Under his lord&s;hip acted his brother Major General Keppel; another brother, Commodore Keppel, commanded un|der Sir George. The mini&s;try &s;eemed to take a pride in omitting nothing that could make this expedition &s;ucce&s;sful, and on the 17th of Febru|ary, Sir George Pocock took leave of his Ma|je&s;ty, and &s;et out for Port&s;mouth to imbark the troops. On the 7th of March, the fleet pa&s;&s;ed by Plymouth, and on the 16th of June, an account came to England of the Admiral having &s;ailed, with the men of war and tran&s;ports, the 16th of May, from Martinico to the Havannah. A long &s;ilence with regard to this expedition &s;ucceeded, which greatly embarra&s;&s;ed the public of England, but in September, an account came by a gentle|man who left the Havannah the 18th of July. By it, we were informed, that two days before our fleet arrived there, two Dutch &s;hips got in with pow|der and warlike &s;tores; and that our troops took two waggons laden with money, going from the town to the mountains, where all the nuns, prie&s;ts, and other people had retired. That the Spani&s;h fleet at that place con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even &s;hips of 70 guns, and three of 60, having on board 5340 &s;eamen, 1460 &s;oldiers; two of 60, ju&s;t launched, one rigged but not manned, and that Don Lewis de Vela&s;co, Captain of the El Bayna of 70 guns, commanded in the Moro ca&s;tle. All this intelligence happened to be pretty near the truth, only the Spani&s;h naval force was in reality greater than we knew of. After this, the public
<PB N="200" REF="203">
apprehen&s;ions encrea&s;ed from the profound &s;ilence that was ob&s;erved with regard to the &s;iege, the rea&s;on of which &s;oon appeared. For the ca&s;tle El Moro, being the capital defence of the place, it had been agreed upon, between the General and the Admiral, to di&s;patch no accounts till that was reduced, as they were morally &s;ure the town and the other forts mu&s;t &s;oon follow. At la&s;t, on the 30th of September, letters from the Earl of Albermarle and Sir George Pocock arrived at the Secretary of State's, and the Admiralty Office, dated Augu&s;t 21, with an account, that the Moro Fort was taken by &s;torm, on the 30th of July, by his Maje&s;ty's troops under Major General Keppel, who commanded the attack. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">Our mines, &s;aid the Earl of Albermarle in his let|ter to the Earl of Egremont, were &s;prung about one o'clock and a breach made ju&s;t practicable for a file of men in front. The enemy was drawn up on the top of it in force, with a &s;eeming determination to defend it. The attack was &s;o vigorous and impetuous, that the enemy was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly drove from the breach, and his Maje&s;ty's &s;tandard planted upon the ba&s;tion. I did not &s;end a particular expre&s;s with this good news to your Lord&s;hip, becau&s;e I flattered my&s;elf, that what has hap|pened would &s;oon be the con&s;equence of our &s;ucce&s;s at Fort Moro. On the 11th in the morning, by a &s;ignal from the fort, we opened our batteries again&s;t the town and Punta fort. The guns and mortars were &s;o well &s;erved by the artillery and &s;ailors, and their effect &s;o great, that in le&s;s than &s;ix hours, all the guns in the fort and north ba&s;tion were &s;ilenced. The governor hung out the white flag, and beat a parley, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent out
<PB N="201" REF="204">
an officer to propo&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for twenty four hours, in order to prepare the ar|ticles of capitulation.</Q></P>
<P>This good news di&s;&s;ipated the gloom, and the melancholy apprehen&s;ions of the public, and the mini&s;try &s;eemed now to triumph over all oppo&s;i|tion. All this while, his Catholic Maje&s;ty was making the mo&s;t vigorous preparations for the en|tire conque&s;t of Portugal, and the command of that expedition was given to the Marquis of Ser|ria; while the French army was advancing to &s;econd his motions. Upon this, his mo&s;t Faithful Maje&s;ty recalled his mini&s;ters from the courts of Madrid and Ver&s;ailles, the Marquis of Serria entered the Portugue&s;e territories on the 7th of May, and rather &s;eemed to make a tour than a campaign, &s;o cowardly was the behaviour of the Portugue&s;e. Unfortunately for England, his mo&s;t Faithful Maje&s;ty's &s;everities, however nece&s;&s;ary they might have been, again&s;t his great|e&s;t &s;ubjects, had rai&s;ed up a great &s;pirit of di&s;af|fection again&s;t him, and many, even of tho&s;e who were intru&s;ted with military commands, were in the intere&s;ts of Spain. The fir&s;t place in Por|tugal which the Spani&s;h General attacked was Miranda, and, while they were preparing a bat|tery to act again&s;t it, a fire broke out in a maga|zine in the town and blew it up. Though ho&s;|tilities had not been then begun, this event had determined Don Bento Jo&s;eph Fagueredo, gover|nor of the place, to de&s;ire the Spaniards would not proceed in their operations, and to &s;urrender him|&s;elf pri&s;oner of war with his garri&s;on. Four bat|talions of the Iri&s;h brigade, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the regi|ment of Galicia, entered through two breaches made in the walls by the explo&s;ion; while the regiment of Numantia and Merida dragoons en|tered
<PB N="202" REF="205">
by the gates, under the orders of Don Ri&s;aguero Lieutenant General. They found in Miranda, exclu&s;ive of the &s;taff officers of the place, twenty other officers, fifteen &s;erjeants, one drummer, and 324 &s;oldiers of the regiment of Braganza, together with two troopers, one offi|cer of artillery, fifteen mattro&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and three engineers; the other officers and &s;oldiers on guard were almo&s;t all buried in the ruins of the magazine, and it is computed that 500 per&s;ons peri&s;hed there, including the inhabitants. This acqui&s;ition was &s;ucceeded by the &s;urrender of Bra|ganza, which the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of five com|panies of foot abandoned, as the garri&s;on of Chaves, though compo&s;ed of 2000 men, did that place; and the conquerors found Moncor&s;o eva|cuated not only by the military, but the civil power. The Spaniards then proceeded again&s;t Almeyda, where they met with a &s;mall check from the Portugue&s;e militia. But by this time the Briti&s;h auxiliaries had landed, and Crauford's regiment having joined the Portugue&s;e army, they took a po&s;ition for cutting off the return of the Spaniards to their own country, flattering them&s;elves that the invaders, being pre&s;t for want of provi&s;ions, mu&s;t &s;oon retreat.</P>
<P>But, at this juncture, the French auxiliaries were marching to &s;upport the Spaniards, and the Eng|li&s;h under the Count la Lippe, had taken the field for the Portugue&s;e, while the Spaniards were making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Salvaterra, and the ca&s;tle of Segura; and the French on their part met with as little oppo&s;ition. Thus, the whole kingdom of Portugal was on the point of falling a prey to her enemies in the mo&s;t &s;hameful da&s;tardly manner that we meet with in hi&s;tory, when &s;he was &s;aved by Briti&s;h arms and
<PB N="203" REF="206">
Briti&s;h councils. Count de la Lippe re&s;olved to open his operations, by exhibiting a &s;pecimen of Briti&s;h courage, that &s;hould a&s;toni&s;h the Spaniards, and encourage the Portugue&s;e. He detached Brigadier General Burgoyne with his regiment and 17 companies of grenadiers, to make an attack on Valencia d'Alcantara, from whence they di&s;|lodged the enemy &s;word in hand. The Spani&s;h regiment of Seville was entirely de&s;troyed, a Major General, a Colonel, a Captain, five Lieu|tenants, three &s;tands of colours, and all the private men were taken who e&s;caped the &s;word. The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h troops on this occa&s;ion were no more than Lieutenant Burk of Colonel Frederick's, one &s;erjeant and three private killed; two &s;erjeants, one drummer, and 18 private wounded. After this, the Engli&s;h and Portu|gue&s;e entrenched them&s;elves about eight miles from Abrantes, the pa&s;s for Li&s;bon; being de|termined there to wait for the Spaniards.</P>
<P>But all the exertion of the Briti&s;h courage and di&s;cipline could not in&s;pire the Portugue&s;e with courage, or even reconcile them to the Briti&s;h, whom they treated, not as their deliverers, but their enemies. Count de la Lippe complained of this to his Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty, but all he could do was, to threaten his Generals and Officers for their di&s;obedience. This &s;eems to have had &s;ome kind of influence, for, on the 6th of Oc|tober, at Villa Velha the Portugue&s;e troops &s;hewed &s;ome degree of &s;pirit, when the Gene|rals Town&s;hend and Burgoyne &s;urrounded a large body of Spaniards there, and forced them to &s;ur|render pri&s;oners. Some very hot encounters afterwards happened, in which the Briti&s;h cou|rage, as u&s;ual, di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf, and effectu|ally defeated the &s;cheme the Spaniards had
<PB N="204" REF="207">
formed, of pa&s;&s;ing over the Tagus into the pro|vince of Alentejo. After that, they were obliged to retire from Ca&s;tello Branco, and repa&s;s the mountains which &s;eparate the provinces of E&s;tre|madura and Beira. But we are to ob&s;erve, that by this time, the peace was looked upon to be in forwardne&s;s between Great Britain and France.</P>
<P>The more di&s;cerning part of the public, per|ceiving that nothing ob&s;tructed its final conclu|&s;ion, &s;o much as the incertainty both courts were under with regard to the affairs of America. The news of the reduction of Martinico had not yet arrived in Europe, and the Briti&s;h expedition a|gain&s;t the Havannah was no &s;ecret to the pub|lic. The French, who treated &s;eparately from Spain, affected to give out, that they were ready to grant the &s;ame terms which they had offered before, whether the expedition again&s;t Martinico was &s;ucce&s;sful or no. But the Briti&s;h mini&s;try re&s;olved to wait the event, and to act accordingly. They carried their views farther than their pre|dece&s;&s;ors had done for the &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h colonies in North America, which they thought mu&s;t be precarious, without a much larger extent of territory, than what the French had yet of|fered; and unle&s;s they obtained the free naviga|tion of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. They thought, when they had obtained that, their back &s;ettlements were im|pregnable to the power of their enemies, and that every thing was provided for, that their co|lonies in tho&s;e parts had &s;o long required, and la|mented that they were not able to obtain. The&s;e advantages, they rea&s;onably imagined, mu&s;t be greatly improved, in ca&s;e the expedition again&s;t the Havannah &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful; but it mu&s;t be obtained, if it &s;hould not.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="208">
The conque&s;t of Martinico did not forward the conclu&s;ion of peace &s;o much as was expected. The French grew &s;ullen at their lo&s;s and di&s;|grace, and the ea&s;y purcha&s;e the Engli&s;h had made of the fine&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in America; while the court of London, on the other hand, thought that the conque&s;t of Martinico intitled them to in&s;i&s;t upon higher terms than before. Thus the &s;ecret negociations between the two courts grew more perplexed, and po&s;&s;ibly would have been ineffectual, had not his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty been inflexibly determined to have peace at any rate, and given his mini&s;ters orders accordingly. The majority of his council oppo&s;ed this pacific di&s;po&s;ition, and the court of Madrid in&s;i&s;ted up|on his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's waiting for the re&s;ult of the Engli&s;h expedition again&s;t the Ha|vannah, which they con&s;idered to be more ro|mantic and impracticable than any of the many adventures of their own knight errant.</P>
<P>But all remon&s;trances were in vain, and the preliminaries being agreed upon, the Duke de Ni|vernois was appointed Amba&s;&s;ador from his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian, to his Britannic Maje&s;ty; and the Duke of Bedford was, by his Britannic Maje&s;ty, on the 4th of September, appointed his mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to the court of France. While tho&s;e pacific mea&s;ures were carrying into execu|tion, the Briti&s;h troops were undergoing the mo&s;t fatiguing &s;ervice, any body of men ever experi|enced, in the &s;iege of the Havannah, but with &s;uch per&s;evering intrepidity, that, on the 29th of September, the Captains Harvey and Nugent brought to St. James's, an account of its &s;ur|render, and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty the colours taken in the place. As the particulars of this me|morable &s;iege are heavy and unentertaining, it may
<PB N="206" REF="209">
be &s;ufficient to acquaint our readers, that many of our brave&s;t &s;oldiers and &s;ailors died before the place, through the inclemency of the climate, and that it was at la&s;t taken, after &s;torming the breach our troops had made in the Moro Ca&s;tle, where the brave Vela&s;co its Governor was killed; and that the other forts and the town &s;urrender|ed by capitulation. But though the negotiations and treaty of peace, between France and Eng|land, had relaxed, and at la&s;t extingui&s;hed the war between tho&s;e two powers, they as yet had no effect on the war between his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty and the Empre&s;s Queen. The Briti&s;h troops, in the beginning of the year, &s;till remained in Germany, and Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia opened the campaign in Saxony, with &s;ome advantages over the army of the Empire. The allied army under Prince Ferdinand a&s;&s;embled in its canton|ments, and &s;ent for 12 battalions from their army on the Lower Rhine, while the war continued in Sile|&s;ia between his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty and the Empre&s;s Queen, who threatened to lay &s;iege either to Nei&s;s or Glogau. The Ru&s;&s;ian General Bran|demer met with a &s;evere defeat near Chemnitz, but in return Prince Henry took Freyberg, every where defeated the Au&s;trians, and made upwards of 7000 of them pri&s;oners, with all their artil|lery, waggons, and ammunition. In the mean while, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty obliged Count Daun to retire to the mountains on the frontiers of Bo|hemia, and his affairs were in the full career of &s;ucce&s;s, when he received the a&s;toni&s;hing news that his friend and ally the new Emperor of Ru&s;|&s;ia was depo&s;ed and murdered. From this time his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty re&s;olved to act on the defen|&s;ive, but had the good fortune to retake Schweid|nitz, in which was a garri&s;on of 8000 men,
<PB N="207" REF="210">
commanded by Count Gua&s;co. Here we may fairly clo&s;e the hi&s;tory of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's military operations, during the la&s;t campaign of this war. All that &s;ucceeded were merely pre|cautionary, but were conducted with &s;uch judg|ment, as terminated in his concluding with the court of Vienna, a mo&s;t glorious peace, and en|tering with the Empre&s;s Queen into connexions, &s;o &s;trict and intimate, that we can &s;carcely per|&s;uade our&s;elves they had ever been at war.</P>
<P>However dazzling this good fortune of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, it is mo&s;t certain, that it was entirely owing to the friend&s;hip of the court of England. While the negociations for peace were in &s;u&s;pence, the Briti&s;h Generals in Ger|many received orders to act with redoubled vi|gour. In con&s;equence of this, Prince Ferdi|nand, on the 4th of June, attacked the French in their camp of Graeben&s;tein, under the Mar|&s;hals D'Etrees and Soubi&s;e. Four different at|tacks were made. The fir&s;t under General Luck|ner, one under General Sporken, one under Prince Ferdinand him&s;elf who attacked the cen|ter, and the la&s;t by the Marqui&s;s of Granby. The three la&s;t Generals pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel, tho' from different quarters, almo&s;t at the &s;ame mi|nute; and had it not been for the intrepidity of Mon&s;. de Stanville, a French officer, who put him&s;elf at the head of the flower of the French infantry, their whole army mu&s;t have been de|&s;troyed; an undi&s;puted victory, however, fell to his Britannic Maje&s;ty's troops, who did not lo&s;e above 300 men. The lo&s;s of the French was immen&s;e. The fine body of infantry under Stan|ville, by favouring the retreat of their cavalry, was entirely de&s;troyed or taken pri&s;oners, except|ing
<PB N="208" REF="211">
two battalions that fled, and it was upon all hands agreed, that the victory, in which 2570 French pri&s;oners were made, was in a great mea|&s;ure owing to the gallant behaviour of the Mar|qui&s;s of Granby, at the head of the Briti&s;h troops. We are only to add on this occa&s;ion, that the French infantry con&s;i&s;ted of 100 battalions, and the Engli&s;h had no more than 60.</P>
<P>After this victory, part of the French army retired precipitately over the Fulda, and there en|camped them&s;elves under the cannon of He&s;&s;e. On the 23d of July, the Hanoverians and He&s;&s;i|ans pa&s;&s;ed the Fulda, and beat the right of the French army under the command of Prince Xa|vier. On which occa&s;ion, the French again owed their pre&s;ervation to the courage and con|duct of their General Stanville. Various ope|rations then &s;ucceeded; but the Prince of Con|d&eacute;, having, without the knowledge of the Here|ditary Prince, been reinforced by the two French Mar&s;hals, beat his &s;erene highne&s;s, who, be&s;ides the Germans, had with him Elliot's dragoons and the piquets under Lord Frederic Cavendi&s;h. In this action, the Hereditary Prince was wounded, and the lo&s;s of the allies in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, amounted to at lea&s;t 1500 men; but by the good di&s;po&s;itions of Prince Ferdinand, their enemies were prevented from pur&s;uing their advantage.</P>
<P>Mean while, Prince Ferdinand laid &s;iege to Ca&s;&s;el, which was ob&s;tinately defended by Mon&s;. Die&s;bach, the French commandant, but was at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender, in con&s;equence, as we ap|prehend, of orders from his court, who had now fully &s;ettled the preliminaries with Great Britain. While this &s;iege was carrying on, one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate actions, that had happened during
<PB N="209" REF="212">
the whole war, pa&s;&s;ed at Amoeneburg (which was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the allies) between the French and the Marquis of Granby, in the night between the 20th and 21&s;t of October. The intention of the French was to di&s;lodge the allies from that town, again&s;t which they rai&s;ed &s;ome batteries in the night near a mill. The firing alarmed Lord Granby. He marched with all his troops to the relief of the place as the French did with all theirs to &s;upport the attack, and the latter at la&s;t brought out 20 pieces of artillery. The mo&s;t dreadful cannonading, con&s;idering the &s;mallne&s;s of the po&s;ts, that ever was known in the military art, en&s;ued. The allies maintained the redoubt, and the French the works they had rai&s;ed at the mill. The enemy fired from their great artillery upon the redoubt, at the di&s;tance of no more than 300, and with their &s;mall arms, at that of 30 paces. Fifty pieces of cannon were em|ployed, the execution of which was confined to a &s;pace not exceeding 400 paces, and for 15 hours, the firing both from the great and &s;mall arms had not the &s;malle&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion. No fewer than 17 complete battalions were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively employed in relieving the troops that defended the redoubt, and tho&s;e who came late&s;t, were obliged to rai&s;e a parapet of dead bodies for their defence. The French at the &s;ame time attacked Amoeneburg, and after being three times repul&s;ed, the garri&s;on &s;urrendered pri&s;oners, which put an end to this bloody action. As to the lo&s;s, it very probably was dimini&s;hed on both &s;ides; for the allies gave out that they had not above 800 killed; but the French them&s;elves, two of who&s;e Generals were dangerou&s;ly wounded in the action, did not deny that their lo&s;s was much greater. This, as it was the mo&s;t bloody, was the la&s;t action of the war;
<PB N="210" REF="213">
for, on the 15th of December, a convention was &s;igned at Brucker's Muhl upon the Oh'me, be|tween the Generals Howard and Guerchy, au|thori&s;ed by his &s;erene highne&s;s Prince Ferdinand, and the French Mar&s;hals, for an immediate ce&s;|&s;ation of ho&s;tilities between the Briti&s;h and French armies, who were upon the point of &s;e|parating, in order to march into their re&s;pective winter quarters. Never was there a more &s;ud|den and more plea&s;ing tran&s;ition from enmity to e&s;teem, than &s;ucceeded the &s;ignature. The French and the allies ru&s;hed into mutual em|braces, and nothing was heard but the mo&s;t rap|turous admiration of the valour of the one from the mouths of the other. Several days were &s;pent in magnificent and &s;ocial entertainments, given by the one army to the other, from the commander in chief to the meane&s;t &s;ubaltern. And, to the honour of the Briti&s;h troops, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that on their return home, they re|ceived the thanks of the States-General them|&s;elves, through who&s;e dominions they pa&s;&s;ed, for their &s;obriety, regularity, and punctual payment of whatever they were furni&s;hed with, in that republick.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Havannah gave a mo&s;t dread|ful blow to the intere&s;ts of Spain, and &s;uch as that court believed impo&s;&s;ible to have happened, yet the new Briti&s;h mini&s;try to make good their profe&s;&s;ions upon the re&s;ignation of Mr. Pitt, that they would carry on the war with more vigour than ever, if Spain &s;hould force them to declare it, re&s;olved to attack Manilla, one of the Philippine I&s;lands, an enterprize till then deemed impracticable by any European power. Every one knows how inacce&s;&s;ible tho&s;e i&s;lands which extend from North lat. 6, to near 20;
<PB N="211" REF="214">
and from Ea&s;t lon. 114, to 126, are to all but the Spaniards, which, ever &s;ince their di&s;covery under Philip the Second, from whom they take their name, they have indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from the re&s;t of the world, as being the mo&s;t re|condite &s;tore hou&s;es of their wealth. Tho&s;e i&s;lands, are &s;aid to be 1200 in number, the chief, which belongs to the Spaniards is Lu|conia, and contains the city Manilla, the &s;eat of the Spani&s;h Viceroy. Without entering into any geographical de&s;cription, which does not belong to this work, the city of Manilla is rich, populous, and &s;trong, and, all the time of the expedition we are now to treat of, was thought to contain immen&s;e quantities of trea&s;ure. The command of the land forces, appointed to re|duce it, was given to Colonel William Draper, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf on many occa&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies. The embarkation was made at Madra&s;s, and the forces con&s;i&s;ted of the 75th regiment with a company of the royal artillery, while the &s;ettlement at Madra&s;s furni&s;hed 600 Sea-poys, a company of Cafres, one of Topa|zes, two companies of French, who had inli&s;ted in their &s;ervice, and &s;ome unarmed La&s;cars for the u&s;e of the artillery. This little army was reinforced by rear Admiral Corni&s;h, who com|manded the &s;ea forces, with a fine battalion of 350 &s;eamen and 270 marines; &s;o that the whole force for the land operations amounted to 2300 men, which were all that could be &s;pared from the nece&s;&s;ary protection of Madra&s;s. The &s;hips em|ployed upon the expedition, were the Elizabeth, Grafton, Lenox, Weymouth, and Argo, who were di&s;patched before with Commodore Tidde|man; and on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, they were fol|lowed by the Norfolk, Panther, America, Sea|ford,
<PB N="212" REF="215">
South-&s;ea ca&s;tle &s;tore &s;hip, Admiral Ste|vens's &s;tore &s;hip, and the O&s;terly a company's &s;hip, under the command of Admiral Corni&s;h; two Ea&s;t-India &s;hips &s;erving for tran&s;ports. Nothing remarkable happened till, on the 23d of Sep|tember, they anchored in Manilla bay, and the Colonel, after landing his men and artillery un|der a fire of the frigates, which di&s;per&s;ed the Spaniards who were a&s;&s;embling in great num|bers, on the 25th, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of an ex|cellent po&s;t, which not only covered the landing of their &s;tores, but &s;ecured their communication with their &s;quadron. The Engli&s;h troops, how|ever, &s;uffered greatly from the rains, and the per|petual &s;urf on the &s;hore rendered the landing of the artillery and &s;tores a matter of great diffi|culty. The per&s;everance and intrepidity of the Engli&s;h troops got the better of all ob&s;tacles, and the Spaniards were driven from their advanced po&s;ts into the town, after a re&s;i&s;tance that gave the Engli&s;h no high ideas of their courage.</P>
<P>The pride, ignorance, and cruelty, of the de|fendants, are &s;carcely to be credited. Their Archbi&s;hop was their governor and commander in chief; but &s;o weak a man, that when &s;ome foul weather began to ri&s;e which incommoded the Engli&s;h, he publickly declared to his people, that the angel of God was about to di&s;per&s;e and de&s;troy the Engli&s;h, as he had done the ho&s;t of Sennacherib. When &s;ummoned to &s;urren|der, he in return advi&s;ed the Engli&s;h to de&s;i&s;t from their undertaking, becau&s;e his city was impregnable. Ten thou&s;and neighbouring In|dians, the mo&s;t cruel and barbarous people under the &s;un, were introduced into the city, which was in a manner open to them, the handful of Eng|li&s;h being able to inve&s;t but a very &s;mall part of
<PB N="213" REF="216">
it. The fiercene&s;s of the Barbarians was re|markably di&s;played in the following tragedy. The governor's nephew had been taken in the bay by the Engli&s;h, and his excellency &s;ent a flag of truce reque&s;ting the favour that he might be &s;et on &s;hore, which was accordingly granted; and Lieutenant Fryar, the General's own &s;ecre|tary, was appointed to conduct him to the city. In their way thither, they met with a large party of the garri&s;on, intermingled with Indians, who mo&s;t inhumanly murdered Lieutenant Fryar and mangled his body in a manner too &s;hocking &s;o be related, and at the &s;ame time mortally wounded the gentleman, while he was endeavouring to &s;ave his conductor. The weather and rains con|tinued &s;till to be &s;o unfavourable to the Engli&s;h, that the Archbi&s;hop tru&s;ted to the elements for his deliverance; while the Indians in their &s;allies, though &s;lightly armed, fearle&s;sly ran up to the very muzzles of their enemy's pieces, and expired like wild bea&s;ts gnawing the bayonet that gave them death. At la&s;t, after &s;urmounting incredible difficulties, and the Spaniards conti|nuing &s;till ob&s;tinate, though not brave, a breach was made, which the Engli&s;h re&s;olved to &s;torm. This was done with &s;uch amazing &s;pirit and ra|pidity, that the Spaniards made no effort of re|&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that the Engli&s;h were afraid the ene|my had &s;ome mines in re&s;erve to &s;pring; but without rea&s;on. The chief re&s;i&s;tance they met with was at the royal gate, where a hundred Spaniards and Indians, who refu&s;ed to &s;urrender, were put to the &s;word, and about 300 were drowned in attempting to pa&s;s the river. At la&s;t, the governor and principal officers, who had re|tired to the citadel, which was in a good po&s;ture of defence, &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; and thus
<PB N="214" REF="217">
the ab&s;olute reduction of the place, with its nu|merous artillery and &s;tores, was effected. If the trea&s;ure found here by the Engli&s;h was not &s;o great as expected, it was owing to the unavoid|able misfortune they were under of not being able to inve&s;t the place; by which, their enemies were at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of their trea&s;ure and effects as they plea&s;ed. To make them &s;ome amends, however, during the &s;iege, Captain Parker in the Panther made prize of a rich Aca|pulco &s;hip, valued at three millions of dollars; and the Admiral and General reduced the enemy to the nece&s;&s;ity of offering our forces an honour|able and beneficial capitulation, which they ac|cepted, very fortunately for them, and for us, as the places would otherwi&s;e have been given up, without redemption, by the following treaty.</P>

<HEAD>Some Reflections on the above Treaty of Peace.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Review would be incomplete, did we not indulge our readers and our&s;elves in a few reflections upon the probable con&s;equences, which the glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es it contains, may produce.</P>
<P>France, the old and natural enemy of Great Britain, is now &s;en&s;ible of one truth, which, however &s;eemingly incon&s;i&s;tent, is founded on rea&s;on and experience; we mean, that Great Britain is &s;tronger, fighting by her&s;elf and for her&s;elf, than if half Europe were her allies. In the wars of King William and Queen Anne, &s;he fought in the quarrels of nations, who were a dead weight upon her arms; her motions were directed by theirs; and, though under the Duke
<PB N="238" REF="241">
of Marlborough, &s;he always was victorious, yet the fruits of her &s;ucce&s;&s;es were lo&s;t, through the jarring, but private, intere&s;ts of her allies, who left the greate&s;t burden of the war upon her &s;houlders, though lea&s;t concerned in its event. In the next war with France, that in &s;upport of the Au&s;trian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the per&s;on of her pre|&s;ent Imperial Maje&s;ty, it was evident &s;he mu&s;t have been victorious, had it not been for the Dutch and German confederates; the treache|rous cowardice of the former lo&s;t her the battle of Fontenoy, as the &s;elfi&s;h haughtine&s;s of the other did that of Lafeldt. Even in the war, of which we have ju&s;t clo&s;ed the review, though Great Britain paid all, &s;he may be &s;aid to have fought all, and &s;carcely a glorious action hap|pened through the whole, that was not per|formed by her natives; but when we &s;ay this, we except the great exploits of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. The ob&s;ervation we have made holds &s;till more &s;trongly in her naval operations. How many di&s;graceful blows did &s;he receive by &s;ea from France, when her fleets were united with tho&s;e of the Dutch; while in the late war, tho' &s;he &s;tood &s;ingle, every action at &s;ea, except that doubtful one under Admiral Byng, proved deci|&s;ive in her favour. The con&s;equence is, that France, humbled by &s;o many repeated blows, has relinqui&s;hed the ambitious, but artful &s;chemes, which &s;he had been forming for above half a century again&s;t the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in North America. Had the&s;e proved &s;ucce&s;sful, all in|tercour&s;e between the Briti&s;h planters and the natives mu&s;t have been entirely cut off; the French would have had the &s;avages of their own training, as well as in their intere&s;t, and would have employed the natural ferocity of tho&s;e bar|barians,
<PB N="239" REF="242">
fir&s;t in exterminating our back &s;ettlers, and next in attacking the vitals of our mo&s;t po|pulous colonies, which mu&s;t have been attended with the almo&s;t immediate ruin of the Briti&s;h commerce in that part of the world.</P>
<P>The fortunate events of the war in our favour have turned upon the French the de&s;truction they had meditated again&s;t us. They them&s;elves are now di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of almo&s;t all they had in North America, &s;o effectually, that, in all human pro|bability, we can never have a competitor in tho&s;e parts of the world, either in power or com|merce.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t Indies, the Briti&s;h arms have been beyond all precedent &s;ucce&s;sful, and that too at a time when our common enemy, flu&s;hed with recent &s;ucce&s;&s;es, was in hopes of engro&s;&s;ing, upon our ruin, the trade of A&s;ia to him&s;elf. But now, there, as well as in North America, our intere&s;t is &s;o durably e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the power of France &s;o effectually reduced, that we have nothing to fear but from the Dutch, as the na|tives, in all likelihood, will never break with the Engli&s;h, whom they have &s;een perform &s;uch amazing prodigies of valour.</P>
<P>Three important conque&s;ts, tho&s;e of Guada|loupe, Martinico and the Havannah, have in|deed been returned by the definitive treaty; but the lo&s;s of them were of infinitely more preju|dice to the enemy, than their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion could have been of &s;ervice to us.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o agreed to permit the French to fi&s;h on the banks of Newfoundland, in the gulph St. Lawrence, and on the coa&s;ts of the i&s;land of Cape Breton, and given them the i&s;lands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, for that purpo&s;e, with leave to keep &s;tores, and to
<PB N="240" REF="243">
cure and dry their fi&s;h in Newfoundland. This is by far the wor&s;t part of the treaty; for be&s;ides that Great Britain, by engro&s;&s;ing the whole of the fi&s;hery, might have employed all her poor &s;ailors who are now in di&s;tre&s;s, it would have brought large &s;ums into the nation, and, what is of &s;till greater con&s;equence, her navy would have been &s;o &s;trengthened, and that of France &s;o impaired, by this means, that in all probability no war would have en&s;ued for a century, and our mini&s;try and people, with common prudence, might have di&s;|charged the whole of the national debt, enor|mous as it is.&mdash;Be&s;ides the conque&s;ts made by Great Britain, during the cour&s;e of the war, the French marine was almo&s;t annihilated, and that of Spain &s;o damaged, as not to be repaired for &s;ome years; &s;o that this &s;eemed to be the time for Great Britain to &s;ettle a peace to her own &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The war in Germany, in its own nature, was but a &s;econdary con&s;ideration to Great Britain; but the engagements we had entered into there, rendered it in fact a primary one. To di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e engagements, without hurting the honour of the nation, or endangering the balance of power on the continent of Europe, was the great object that, &s;oon after the acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, employed the attention of his mini&s;ters. They &s;ucceeded in their intention beyond the ex|pectation of the public. They more than ful|filled their actual engagements with his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty; and, after the defection of the Ru&s;&s;ians from the cau&s;e of Au&s;tria, they took off the French from being his enemies. The &s;en&s;ible and immediate effect of this was, that the Princes of the empire, who think they have no &s;ecurity again&s;t the power of Au&s;tria, but the treaty of
<PB N="241" REF="244">
We&s;tphalia, of which the French are guarantees, openly embraced a neutrality, and &s;ecretly re|&s;olved to oblige the Queen of Hungary to lay down her arms, and thereby to give &s;ome re&s;pite to the exhau&s;ted, de&s;olated, country of Germany. Thus his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, by his own magna|nimity, and the wi&s;e conduct of Great Britain, in obliging the French to abandon the German war, gained all he had fought for. The court of Vienna, finding it&s;elf un&s;upported, agreed to a peace, which might have been made in the beginning of the war, and which would have &s;aved the lives of above a million of brave men. Nor was this the only good effect of their con|duct, for her Imperial Maje&s;ty begins now to be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;elfi&s;h views with which France joined her, and &s;ees how dangerous &s;uch an unnatural conjunction may prove to the peace and independency of the Germanic body. There is, therefore, all the rea&s;on in the world to hope, that the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, find|ing it can do nothing again&s;t that of Branden|burgh, will unite with it in watching that of Bourbon, while his Britannic Maje&s;ty, dive&s;ted of all foreign partialities, will re&s;ume the glo|rious, but almo&s;t forgotten, character of being the umpire of Europe.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Studies which have employed the indu&s;tri|ous, or amu&s;ed the idle, perhaps Natural Hi&s;tory de&s;erves the preference; other &s;ciences generally termi|nate in doubt, or re&s;t in bare &s;peculation; but here every &s;tep is marked with certainty, and while a de&s;cription of the objects around us teaches to &s;upply our Wants, it &s;a|tisfies our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>A comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem, however, of this mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;cience has been hitherto wanting. Nor is it a little &s;ur|pri&s;ing, when every other branch of literature has been of late cultivated with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, how this mo&s;t intere&s;ting department &s;hould have been neglected.</P>
<P>How far the pre&s;ent Performance has &s;upplied the de|fects, and reformed the errors of Natural Hi&s;tory, is left to the Public to determine. Tho&s;e who have read the Author's Practice of Phy&s;ic, and his other Medical and Geographical Compo&s;itions, will &s;ee evident marks, not only of the Philo&s;opher, but of the accurate and judicious Traveller; and cannot doubt but his Abilities were ade|quate to this Undertaking, and that he had abundant Op|portunities to convince him&s;elf of the Truth of what he has a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>He has had, indeed, one Advantage over all other Na|turali&s;ts, namely, that of having vi&s;ited a Variety of Countries, and examined the Productions of each upon the Spot. Whatever <HI>America</HI> or the known Parts of <HI>Africa</HI> have produced to excite Curio&s;ity have been carefully ob|&s;erved by him, and compared with the Accounts of others.</P>
<P>This Work, though compri&s;ed within the Compa&s;s of Six Volumes, has employed great Part of the Author's Life: and there is not a Figure repre&s;ented in any of the Plates, but what was drawn by him&s;elf, or by his Son under his In&s;pection. Nor has the Reader's Convenience been le&s;s con&s;idered than his Plea&s;ure and Improvement. Each of the&s;e Volumes, if printed as Works of this kind u&s;ually are, might have been made a large Quarto, and the Whole have been &s;old for <HI>Six Guineas,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>One;</HI> but as the Improvement of natural Knowledge may conduce to the Improvement of Religion and Piety, it was thought expedient to make this Work as cheap as po&s;&s;ible, that it might fall within the Compa&s;s of every &s;tudious Per&s;on, and that all might be acquainted with the great and wonderful Works of Nature, &s;ee the Dependance of Creature upon Creature, and of all upon the <HI>Creator.</HI></P>
