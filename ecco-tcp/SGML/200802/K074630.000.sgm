<LG>
<L>FOR thy amu&s;ement fir&s;t I tuned the lay,</L>
<L>And dre&s;s'd my thoughts in <HI>Spen&s;er</HI>'s antique &s;tile,</L>
<L>'Twas but a frolic ta&s;k, a youthful play,</L>
<L>Who&s;e be&s;t reward was thy approving &s;mile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It &s;carcely claim'd th' offended Critic's rod,</L>
<L>We love to imitate what we admire;</L>
<L>The Per&s;ian thus adores the Solar God,</L>
<L>And lights, faint Emblem, his terre&s;trial fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer inexperienced I pre&s;ume</L>
<L>On fancied worth, beneath the quaint di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>But &s;trip the veil, remove th&punc; incumbent gloom,</L>
<L>And modern numbers give to modern eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;till to thee I dedicate the &s;ong,</L>
<L>Language may change, our friend&s;hip cannot fade,</L>
<L>To thee all Virtue's winning charms belong,</L>
<L>Nor is my &s;oul of fickle &s;ub&s;tance made.</L>

<L>Melodious glided on the wings of love,</L>
<L>Such &s;ilver tones th' enamour'd gales prolong,</L>
<L>Her flowing mea&s;ures &s;uch, and blandi&s;hment of &s;ong.</L>
<L>And often Virgin <HI>Ba&s;hfulne&s;s</HI> a&s;&s;ay'd</L>

<L>That is the <HI>Land,</HI> replied th' ingenuous Fair,</L>

<L>There too is heart-felt <HI>Joy</HI> with a&s;pect bright,</L>
<L>And Pain is bani&s;h'd thence, and Grief is put to flight.</L>
<L>There too a thou&s;and beauteous Forms re&s;ide,</L>
<L>To which in habit or in &s;hape allied</L>
<L>In other place the eye can never find,</L>
<L>Beings invi&s;ible to common mind:</L>
<L>Of pure&s;t nature, and ethereal race,</L>

For there the <HI>Graces</HI> &s;hed their choice&s;t rays,</L>

<L>Where lay th' expecting bark with &s;ail un&s;pread,</L>

<L>Now, where they &s;ought, the <HI>Maid Divine</HI> they &s;cann'd,</L>

<HEAD>The DEATH-SONG OF RAGNAR LODBRACH, King of DENMARK.</HEAD>
<P>RAGNAR LODBRACH flouri&s;hed in the ninth century, and by his piratical expeditions (according to the cu&s;tom of his countrymen) rendered him&s;elf the terror of the northern parts of Europe. After having carried on his depredations with &s;ucce&s;s for many years, he was at length taken pri|&s;oner by Ella, King of Northumberland, who&s;e coa&s;ts He had invaded, and put to death by Him, being (as was reported) ca&s;t into a dungeon full of &s;erpents. His melan|choly
<PB N="145" REF="144">
fate &s;timulated his Son Ivar to avenge it; and on this occa&s;ion the famous &s;tandard of the Raven is &s;aid to have been embroidered by his Si&s;ters, and con&s;ecrated with &s;uch magic rites as in&s;ured victory to tho&s;e before whom it was borne. Under this &s;tandard Ivar made a de&s;cent on the territories of Ella, fought with, vanqui&s;hed, and put Him to death in his turn.</P>
<P>The following Poem, if we may credit tradition, was compo&s;ed by Ragnar, in his horrid place of confinement. It is apparent however that it mu&s;t have been the work of &s;ome Scald or Bard, probably to do honour to to the memory of his decea&s;ed King, to place before the eyes of his &s;ubjects his heroic atchievements, and urge them, and his Son (or Sons according to the Poem it&s;elf) to revenge.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;erved by Olaus Wormius in his book de Lite|ratur&acirc; Runic&acirc;. While the frequent return of the &s;ame images and expre&s;&s;ions &s;hews the Author's unacquaintance with the nicer rules of compo&s;ition, He exhibits a &s;pecies of
<PB N="146" REF="145">
&s;avage greatne&s;s, a fierce and wild kind of &s;ublimity, and a noble contempt of danger and death. If for no other rea&s;on, this Epicedium is valuable, as it doubtle&s;s affords a lively picture of the manners and &s;entiments of the northern nations.</P>

For the King of Got<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">land having promi&s;ed his daughter Thora to the man who &s;hould kill a va&s;t &s;erpent which wa&s;ted the country, Ragnar undertook the enterprize; and dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, with the hairy &s;ide outermo&s;t, throw water over them, the cold, to which He purpo&s;ely expo&s;ed him&s;elf, forming round him a &s;uit (as it were) of frozen armour. He met the &s;erpent, who&s;e teeth had no effect on this impenetrable mail, fixed him to the ground with his &s;pear, and ripping him up with his &s;word, tore out his heart. After the victory the King pre&s;ented him his daughter, and on account of his rough dre&s;s, gave him the name above mentioned, by which he was from that time di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Olaus Magnus relates this adventure, but &s;ays He fought with and killed two &s;nakes. That the King had taken them when young, and bred them up as a guard for his daughter; but as they increa&s;ed in &s;ize, they became a public terror, and poi&s;oned the country.</P>
