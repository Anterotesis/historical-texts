<HEAD>LETTER I. Containing a De&s;cription of the Counties of <HI>LINCOLN, RUTLAND, NORTHAMP|TON, HUNTINGDON,</HI> and <HI>BEDFORD.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_FROM <HI>Newark,</HI> &s;till keeping the Fo&s;s|way, which lies as &s;trait as a Line can mark it out, we went on to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> having a View of the great Church call'd the <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> all the Way before us, the River <HI>Trent</HI> on the Left, and the <HI>Downs</HI> call'd <HI>Lincoln-Heath</HI> on the Right.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"><HI>Lincoln</HI> is an antient City, govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is &s;o full of the Ruins of Mona|&s;teries, and Religious Hou&s;es, that the very Barns, Stables, Out-hou&s;es, and, as they &s;hew'd me, &s;ome of the very Hog-&s;tyes, are built Church-fa&s;hion; that is to &s;ay, with Stone-Walls, and arch'd Win|dows and Doors. Here are 13 Churches, but the meane&s;t to look on that are any-where to be &s;een. The Cathedral indeed, and the Ruins of the old Ca&s;tle, are very venerable Pieces of Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Lincoln</HI> was a Colony of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and by them nam'd <HI>Lindum Colonia,</HI> which very ea&s;ily falls into the pre&s;ent abbreviated Appellation, <HI>Lincoln.</HI> From its bold and noble Situation upon an high Hill, it &s;eems a Collection of Five Cities. For, fir&s;t, be|low the Hill, and We&s;tward of the City, the River throws it&s;elf into a great Pool called <HI>Swan-pool,</HI> from the Multitude of Swans upon it. All around this Place the Ground is moory, and full of Bogs and I&s;lets; and the Place is called now <HI>Carham,</HI> i. e. a Dwelling upon the <HI>Car,</HI> or Fen. Here was the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> City in the mo&s;t early Times, which they u&s;ed as a Fa&s;tne&s;s for them&s;elves and Cattle in Times of deep Di&s;tre&s;s. From this <HI>Carham</HI> is a plea&s;ant View of the We&s;t-Front of the Cathedral.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Romans,</HI> pleas'd with this Eminence, placed their City upon it, which they fir&s;t built in the Form of a large Square, the Southern Wall be|ing &s;ufficiently &s;ecur'd by the Precipice. Quite round the other Three Sides they carried a deep Trench, which &s;till remains, except on the South|ea&s;t Angle. This City was divided into Four equal Parts by Two cro&s;s Streets. The Two Southern Quarters were taken up, one by the Ca&s;tle, the other by the Church which <HI>Remigius</HI> built. But when Bi&s;hop <HI>Alexander</HI> projected a Structure of much larger Dimen&s;ions, the Inclo&s;ure was carried beyond the Ea&s;tern Bounds of the City, and a new Wall built
<PB N="3" REF="4">
farther that way, as at pre&s;ent, with Battlements and Towers. The North <HI>Roman</HI> Gate of this Part of the City &s;till remains intire, call'd <HI>Newport</HI> Gate, and the noble&s;t Remnant of this Sort in <HI>Bri|tain.</HI> It is a va&s;t Semicircle of Stones laid together without Morter, and cemented only by their wedge|like Shape. This magnificent Arch is 16 Feet Dia|meter, the Stones Four Feet thick at Bottom. From this Gate Ea&s;tward &s;ome Part of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Wall is to be &s;een, made of Stone, and very &s;trong Mortar. The We&s;t Gate towards the Gallows was pulled down within Memory. That on the South Side &s;till &s;hews one Jamb from between the Hou&s;es, and two or three Stones of the &s;ame Make as the former: the re&s;t has been pull'd down by Mr. <HI>Houghton.</HI> On the Ea&s;t Side one Po&s;tern is vi&s;ible, and big enough for a Bed to &s;tand in. By <HI>Newport</HI> Gate is another large and curious Piece of <HI>Roman</HI> Workman&s;hip, call'd the Mint-wall. This is &s;till 16 Feet high, and above 40 Feet long, compo&s;ed of Brick and Stone, laid alternately.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Romans,</HI> finding this City well &s;ituated for Navigation, added another to it as big as the former. This they did Southward upon the Decli|vity of the Hill, and &s;o made it parallel with the other; and the mo&s;t Southern Side lay upon the River. Ea&s;t|ward, the Ditch without is turn'd into a broad Street call'd <HI>The Bea&s;t-Market,</HI> and there below <HI>Cla&s;kgate</HI> a great Part of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Wall is left, made of Stone. One Piece of it is now 80 Feet long, and 18 high. A little of it lower down is 12 Feet long, and as much high. Between that Gate upwards, and the old City-wall, by the <HI>Gree&s;tone-&s;tairs,</HI> the old Ditch call'd <HI>Weredyke,</HI> is to be &s;een. To the We&s;t the Ditch and Foundation of the Wall are &s;till lo&s;t tho' many times repaired and demoli&s;hed in the frequent Sieges this Town has &s;u&s;tain'd, e&s;pecially in the Wars of the Empre&s;s <HI>Maud.</HI> At the Bottom
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of it, towards the Water, is a round Tower, named <HI>Lucy-tower,</HI> much known in her Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another great Addition to the Length of this City, Northward above the Hill, was call'd <HI>Newport,</HI> or the new City, 500 Paces long. This probably was done in the Time of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings. It lies on both Sides the <HI>Hermen-&s;treet,</HI> and was fenc'd with a Wall and Ditch hewn out of the Rock. At the Two farther Corners were round Towers, and a Gate, the Foundations of which remain. There were &s;everal Churches, and religious Hou&s;es, in this Place. It was chiefly inhabited by <HI>Jews,</HI> who had &s;ettled here in great Numbers, and grown rich by Trade. There is a Well &s;till nam'd <HI>Grantham's-well,</HI> from a Child they impiou&s;ly crucified, as was &s;aid, and threw it into that Place.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t, when a great Part of the fir&s;t City was turn'd into a Ca&s;tle, by King <HI>William</HI> I. it is probable they added the la&s;t Intake Southward in the Angle of the <HI>Witham,</HI> and made a new Cut call'd <HI>Sin&s;il-dyke</HI> on the South and Ea&s;t Side for its Security. It is ob&s;ervable, that the <HI>Normans</HI> could not well pronounce <HI>Lincoln,</HI> but vi|tiated it to <HI>Nichol,</HI> as we find it written in &s;ome old Authors: and to this Day a Part of the <HI>Swan-pool</HI> is call'd <HI>Nichol-pool.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' &s;ince tho&s;e Times the City has much de|clin'd, of late it &s;eems to revive, and Trade and Ma|nufactures to flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t Part of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> on both Sides the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Road, were many of that People's funeral Mo|numents; &s;ome of which they now dig up. There is an In&s;cription of that Sort behind the Hou&s;e where the Lord <HI>Hu&s;&s;ey</HI> was beheaded for Rebellion in the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The great Bow-win|dow, thro' which he pa&s;s'd to the Scaffold, was lately taken down. It &s;tands over-again&s;t another Stone Building, of an antique Model, which was
<PB N="5" REF="6">
the Palace of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> who lived here in Royal State, and had the Privilege of Coining. His Arms are here carv'd in Stone. Over-again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, We&s;tward, is an Entrench|ment made by King <HI>Stephen.</HI></P>
<P>The Situation of the City, from what I have &s;aid, mu&s;t appear very particular; one Part is on the flat, and in a Bottom, &s;o that the <HI>Witham,</HI> a little River, that runs through the Town, flows &s;ometimes into the Street: the other Part lies upon the Top of a high Hill, where the Cathedral &s;tands; and the very &s;teepe&s;t Part of the A&s;cent of the Hill, is the be&s;t Part of the City for Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nothing is more trouble&s;ome than the Commu|nication of the upper and lower Town; the Street is &s;o &s;teep and &s;o &s;trait, that the Coaches and Hor&s;es are oblig'd to fetch a Compa&s;s another Way, as well on one Hand as on the other.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Witham</HI> is arch'd over, &s;o that you &s;ee nothing of it as you go through the main Street; but it makes a large Lake on the We&s;t Side, and has a Canal, called the <HI>Po&s;s-dike,</HI> by which it has a Com|munication with the <HI>Trent,</HI> whereby the Navigation of that River is made u&s;eful for Trade to the City. This River mu&s;t have run into the <HI>Humber,</HI> had it not been broken off in the Middle by that great Val|ley under <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and turned into the Salt-mar&s;hes. Hence it is that the Stone upon this We&s;tern Cliff is full of Sea-&s;hells. For the Shell-fi&s;h, when by the re&s;tle&s;s Motion of the Waters in the univer&s;al De|lage, they were carried into the midland Places, were hinder'd by the Weight of their Shells from regaining their original Stations; and thus were confin'd with|in the growing Stone. As a Te&s;timony of which the Skeleton of a Crocodile, or &s;ome &s;uch Animal, in|clo&s;ed in a broad flat Stone, was &s;ent to the Royal Society from the&s;e Parts, by Dr. <HI>Stukeley,</HI> from whom we borrow this Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">There are very good Buildings in the upper City, and &s;everal Families of Gentlemen have Hou&s;es there, be&s;ides tho&s;e of the Prebendaries and other Clergy belonging to the Cathedral.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is a magnificent Fabrick, and is reputed the large&s;t in Extent of any Cathedral in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>York.</HI> But there are in it many ob|vious Blemi&s;hes, which I &s;hall particularly take No|tice of, in comparing it hereafter with <HI>York</HI> Min&s;ter. The Situation is infinitely to its Advantage, as it &s;tands upon a high Hill, and is &s;een into five or &s;ix Counties. It has a double Cro&s;s or Tran&s;ept. The We&s;t End receives a great Addition to its Breadth, by rea&s;on of Two Chapels on each Side of the Side-Ayles; but the Two Towers and Spires are very mean, tho' not for want of Height.</P>
<P>This Cathedral has many Bells; and particularly the Northern Tower is filled up, as one may &s;ay, with the fine&s;t great Bell in <HI>England,</HI> which is called <HI>Tom of Lincoln,</HI> being probably con&s;ecrated to <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.&mdash;As loud as Tom of Lincoln</HI> is a Proverb. It weighs 4 Tons, 1894 Pounds, and will hold 424 Gallons Ale-mea&s;ure; the Circumference is 22 Feet 8 Inches.</P>
<P>The Middle or Rood Tower is the highe&s;t in the whole Kingdom, and when the Spire was &s;tand|ing on it, it mu&s;t, in Proportion to the Height of the Tower, have exceeded that of old <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> which was 520 Feet. The Monks were &s;o proud of this Structure, that they would have it, that the Devil looked upon it with an envious Eye; whence the Proverb of a Man who looks invidious and ma|lignant, <HI>He looks as the Devil over Lincoln.</HI> At pre|&s;ent there are only four very ordinary Pinacles, one at each Corner. It has Two great Gate-hou&s;es or En|trances from the We&s;t. The lower Part of the Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">t, and of the Two Towers, are of <HI>Remigius</HI>'s Building, as is ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by the Colour of
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the Stones, and by the Manner of Architecture: but <HI>Alexander</HI> built the Additions upon it, as likewi&s;e the Body of the Cathedral, the Choir, and <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Tower, which once had a very lofty Spire. St. <HI>Hugh</HI> the <HI>Burgundian</HI> built the Ea&s;t End, or <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Chapel, (where he had a Shrine) and the Chapter|hou&s;e, which is ceil'd with a beautiful Stone Roof, and one Pillar in the Middle.</P>
<P>The Cloi&s;ters and the Library are fine; and the latter is well furni&s;hed with printed Books and Ma|nu&s;cripts.</P>
<P>Two Catharine-wheel Windows, as they are term'd, at the Ends of the larger Tran&s;epts, are re|markably fine for Bullion-work, and painted Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Here are great Numbers of antique Bra&s;&s;es and Monuments.</P>
<P>South of the Church, upon the very Brow of the Hill, is the Bi&s;hop's Palace, built by <HI>Robert de Che&s;|ney,</HI> who gave Two great Bells. Bi&s;hop <HI>Bek,</HI> and other Succe&s;&s;ors, improv'd it into a Magnificence equal to the Cathedral. It &s;tands ju&s;t South of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall. It had many large Bow-windows of curious Workman&s;hip, looking over the lower City into <HI>Nottingham&s;hire.</HI> The Kitchen had Seven Chimneys. The Hall was &s;tately. The Gate|hou&s;e remains intire with the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"> of the Founders. This Palace was ruined in the Time of the Civil Wars; but might be rebuilt with no very great Ex|pence. As the Church is very large, &s;o is the Re|venue of the Bi&s;hoprick, which was formerly im|men&s;ely great, as may be &s;een by the <HI>Mona&s;ticon,</HI> where is an a&s;toni&s;hing Account of the Wealth of the Place.</P>
<P>The Church, as it is the Seat of the Bi&s;hoprick, is not &s;o antient as &s;ome others; the See being re|mov'd, &s;ince the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t, from <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> a little Town in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> not far from <HI>Tame,</HI> of which I have &s;poken in its
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Place; but the City is truly antient, and the Ruins of it tell us as much.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, King <HI>Vortimer,</HI> the valiant <HI>Bri|ton,</HI> dy'd here, and was buried in the Church of the great Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>It is certain, as I have ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> built the Ca&s;tle, to curb the potent Citi|zens; and the Ruins &s;hew, that it was a mo&s;t mag|nificent Work, well fortify'd, and capable of receiv|ing a numerous Gari&s;on.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Lincoln</HI> at that Time contain'd all that now is compris'd in the Dioce&s;es of <HI>Ely, Peterborough,</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> be&s;ides what is now its own; and 'tis &s;till the large&s;t Dioce&s;e in <HI>England</HI>; containing the &s;everal Counties of <HI>Lincoln, Leice&s;ter, Huntingdon, Bedford, Bucks,</HI> and Part of <HI>Hertford</HI>; and in them 1255 Pari&s;hes, whereof 577 are Im|propriations; and there are in the&s;e Bounds &s;ix Arch|deacons, <HI>viz. Lincoln, Leice&s;ter, Bedford, Bucking|ham, Stow,</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon.</HI></P>
<P>Here was the famous Battle fought between the Friends of the Empre&s;s <HI>Maud,</HI> Mother to King <HI>Henry</HI> II. and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> in which that magnani|mous Prince was overthrown and taken Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><HI>Lincoln</HI> &s;tands in a mo&s;t rich, plea&s;ant, and agree|able Country; for on the North, and South-ea&s;t, the noble Plain call'd <HI>Lincoln Heath,</HI> extends it&s;elf, like the Plain about <HI>Salisbury,</HI> for above 50 Miles; <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Sleeford</HI> and <HI>Anca&s;ter</HI> South, to the Bank of the <HI>Humber</HI> North, tho' not with a Breadth equal to the Length; for the Plain is hardly any|where above Three or Four Miles broad.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t Side of this Plain, the <HI>Trent</HI> Waters make a plea&s;ant and rich Valley, running from <HI>New-ark</HI> to <HI>Gain&s;burgh,</HI> thence to <HI>Burton,</HI> and &s;o into the <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gain&s;burgh</HI> hath a large and fine Market, and is very flouri&s;hing for Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, which hath
<PB N="9" REF="10">
increa&s;ed of late Years to the Detriment of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Hull.</HI></P>
<P>The Body of the Pari&s;h-church of this Place had been under a general Decay, and the Walls, Arches, and Pillars, &s;o &s;haken and declin'd from their proper Po&s;ition, that it was judged incapable of Repair. An Act of Parliament therefore pa&s;&s;ed in 1735, for pul|ling down and rebuilding it. It is famous for the <HI>Danes</HI> having landed here, when they came up the <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Trent</HI> by a Ferry, you land in the I&s;le of <HI>Axholm,</HI> which is environ'd by the <HI>Trent</HI> and the <HI>Dun. Littleborough</HI> is the <HI>Agelocum</HI> or <HI>Segelocum</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> a &s;mall Village Three Miles above <HI>Gain&s;burgh,</HI> ju&s;t upon the Edge of the Water, and in a Nook. It &s;eems only to have been environ'd with a Ditch, and was of a &s;quare Form. The Water ran quite round it; for to the We&s;t, where <HI>White's-bridge</HI> is, a watry Valley hems it in; &s;o that it was &s;ufficiently &s;trong. The Church &s;tands upon the highe&s;t Ground. The <HI>Trent</HI> has wa&s;h'd away Part of the Ea&s;tern Side of the Town. Foundations and Pavements are vi&s;ible in the Bank. Here, an Urn, with the Coin of <HI>Domitian,</HI> was found; and great Numbers of Coins have been taken up in ploughing and digging, which they call <HI>Swine-pennies,</HI> becau&s;e tho&s;e Creatures &s;ometimes rout them up, and the In|habitants take little Care to pre&s;erve them. Mr. <HI>Ella,</HI> Vicar of <HI>Rampton</HI> hard by, has collected &s;everal, and &s;ome valuable.</P>
<P>In 1718. Two Altars, hand&s;omely moulded, of coar&s;e Grit-&s;tone, were dug up, which are &s;et as Piers in a Wall on the Side of the Steps, which lead from the River to the Inn. Many very &s;mall Coins, like flatted Peas, call'd <HI>Mites,</HI> are al&s;o found. Mr. <HI>Hardy</HI> has a large Urn, with a Female Face on the Out&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">In this Field, near <HI>White's-bridge,</HI> are great Foun|dations of Buildings. Coins are often found at the lowe&s;t Edge of the Water, when the Tide is gone off, and in dry Sea&s;ons. On the Ea&s;t Side of the River has been a Camp.</P>
<P>By <HI>Tilbridge-lane,</HI> upon the Top of the Heath, is a Spring, which, according to the vulgar Report, flows and ebbs with the <HI>Trent,</HI> tho' at Five Miles Di&s;tance. The like is &s;aid of &s;everal others here|about.</P>
<P>Ten Miles from <HI>Lincoln</HI> Northward is <HI>Spittle,</HI> all the Way to which Place are Milliary Stones. 'Tis very plea&s;ant Riding, being wholly Champaign or Heath. Of the&s;e Stones, I believe, &s;ome are <HI>Ro|man,</HI> others later Cro&s;&s;es to &s;upply their Place. This was, no doubt, a Man&s;ion, becau&s;e hard by a little Beck runs thro' it. Here is an Ho&s;pital, &s;aid to be founded in the Year 1308. There are great Foun|dations all around, &s;ome of which perhaps are <HI>Ro|man.</HI> At pre&s;ent the Village con&s;i&s;ts of Two Farm-hou&s;es, a Chapel, an Inn, and a Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e. Upon the latter, is this In&s;cription:
<Q><L><HI>Haecce domus dat, amat, punit, con&s;ervat, honorat,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Aequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.</HI> 1620.</L></Q> That is,
<Q><L><HI>This Court does Right, loves Peace, pre&s;erves the Laws,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Detects the wrong, rewards the righteous Cau&s;e.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>To the Left is <HI>Normanby,</HI> where the la&s;t but one Duke of <HI>Bucks</HI> was born, and whence he a&s;&s;um'd his Title of Marquis.</P>
<P>Half a Mile Ea&s;t of the pre&s;ent <HI>Wintringham,</HI> &s;tood the old <HI>Roman</HI> Town, now a Common, bounded by the Mar&s;hes upon the <HI>Humber.</HI> The City was plough'd up of late Years, and many An|tiquities found.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">The pre&s;ent <HI>Wintringham</HI> is a dirty poor Place, but &s;till a Corporation, and the Mayor is cho&s;en only out of one Street next the old Town, where was a Chapel. The Bell of it now hangs in a wooden Frame by the Pillory. Here is a va&s;t Jawbone or Rib of a Whale, which has remain'd Time out of Mind.</P>
<P>As the Middle of the Country is all hilly, and the We&s;t Side low, &s;o the Ea&s;t Side is the riche&s;t, mo&s;t fruitful, and be&s;t cultivated, of any County in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;o far from <HI>London.</HI> One Part is all Fen or Mar&s;h Grounds, and extends it&s;elf South to the I&s;le of <HI>Ely.</HI> And here it is that &s;o va&s;t a Quantity of Sheep are fed, as makes this County and that of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter</HI> an inexhau&s;tible Fountain of Wool for all the manufacturing Counties in <HI>England,</HI> as before ob|&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome good Towns on the Sea-coa&s;t, but I include not <HI>Barton,</HI> which &s;tands on the <HI>Hum|ber,</HI> as one of them, being a &s;traggling mean Town, noted for nothing but an ill-favoured dangerous Pa&s;|&s;age, or Ferry, over the <HI>Humber</HI> to <HI>Hull</HI>; where, in an open Boat, in which we had about 15 Hor&s;es, and 10 or 12 Cows, mingled with about 17 or 18 Pa&s;&s;engers, we were about 4 Hours to&s;s'd about on the <HI>Humber,</HI> before we could get into the Harbour at <HI>Hull.</HI></P>
<P>Well may the <HI>Humber</HI> take its Name from the Noi&s;e it makes; for in a high Wind it is incredibly great and terrible, like the Cra&s;h and Da&s;hing toge|ther of Ships.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over <HI>Whitton</HI> Brook, a <HI>Roman</HI> Road goes directly to <HI>Aukborough,</HI> by that People call'd <HI>Aquis.</HI> Their Camp is now call'd <HI>Counte&s;s-clo&s;e,</HI> from a Counte&s;s of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who, they &s;ay, liv'd there, at lea&s;t own'd the E&s;tate. The <HI>Roman</HI> Ca&s;tle is &s;quare, 300 Feet each Side, very conveniently plac'd in the North-we&s;t Angle of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> as a Watch|tower
<PB N="12" REF="13">
over all <HI>Nottingham&s;hire</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> The Church is of good Stone, and has a &s;quare Tower; but the Choir is ruinous, and &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Church by a wooden Partition.

<P>In a &s;quare Plot, call'd <HI>The Green,</HI> is a round Labyrinth nam'd <HI>Julian's Bower,</HI> probably from the warlike Games in U&s;e among the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Youth, call'd <HI>Ludi Trojani,</HI> and &s;aid by <HI>Virgil</HI> to be fir&s;t introduc'd into <HI>Italy</HI> by <HI>Iulus</HI> the Son of <HI>Aeneas.</HI> And the Boys, to this Day, divert them&s;elves with running in it one after another, and eluding their Play-fellows by their intricate Mazes.

<P><HI>Burton</HI> makes a pretty Pro&s;pect, has &s;everal Mills, and the Hou&s;es are plea&s;antly intermix'd with Trees. There are al&s;o Two Churches, one of which is &s;o low in re&s;pect of the Precipice under which it &s;tands, that a Per&s;on may almo&s;t leap from thence upon the Steeple.</P>
<P>At <HI>Barrow</HI> is a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Temple, vulgarly call'd a Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>A little Ea&s;tward hence is <HI>Thornton</HI> College, a great Abbey founded by <HI>William le Gros,</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> in the Year 1139. The Gatehou&s;e is very perfect, being a va&s;t Tower or Ca&s;tle of great Strength both for Offence and Defence. Before it is a large Ditch, acro&s;s which is laid a Bridge with Walls on each Hand, and Arches which &s;upport a broad Bat|tlement to keep off the Enemy. Before it are Two round Towers. There was a Portcullis at the great Gate, and behind it another Gate of Oak. Over the Gate are Three old clum&s;y Statues in the ordi|nary Niches; a Woman &s;eeming a Queen, or the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>; to the Right a Man with a Lamb,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
probably St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t; and to the Left a Bi&s;hop, or Abbat, with a Cro&s;ier. Upon taking down an old Wall, they found a Man with a Candle&s;tick, Table, and Book, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been immur'd. The whole Mona&s;tery was encompa&s;&s;ed by a deep Ditch, and high Rampart, to &s;ecure the Religious from Robbers becau&s;e near the Sea.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame Pari&s;h near the <HI>Humber</HI> is <HI>Vere-court,</HI> which belong'd to the antient Family of that Name.</P>
<P>The Land hereabout is good and well-wooded, and many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are found.</P>
<P>Two Miles We&s;t of <HI>Thornton</HI> are the Ruins of a great <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, call'd <HI>Yarborough,</HI> which &s;urveys the whole Hundred denominated from it. Mr. <HI>How|&s;on</HI> of <HI>Kenington,</HI> which is hard by, has Pecks of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins found here.</P>
<P><HI>Grim&s;by</HI> lies al&s;o on the <HI>Humber,</HI> but lower down towards the Ocean. It is a Mayor-town and Sea|port. But its Harbour is not very &s;afe for Ships to ride in, as appeared at the Time of the great Storm in 1703. when all the Ships in that Road were dri|ven from their Anchors, and mo&s;t of them lo&s;t. Here is a very large &s;umptuous Church.</P>
<P>We took the Round of the Sea-coa&s;t from hence Southward, all the Way to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and pa&s;s'd thro' <HI>Saltfleet, Burgh,</HI> and <HI>Wainfleet,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal Vil|lages lying on the Sea-&s;ide. The Two fir&s;t are but incon&s;iderable Market-towns, but <HI>Wainfleet</HI> is a well-compacted Town and neat, tho' &s;ituated in the Fens. 'Tis noted for a fine Free-&s;chool, and giving an Addition to the Name of the Founder of it, who was call'd <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wainfleet,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and who founded al&s;o <HI>Win|che&s;ter</HI> College.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">The River <HI>Witham</HI> cro&s;&s;es the County from <HI>Lin|coln</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where it di&s;embogues: at the Source of it is a little River of the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>Between this River and the Sea-coa&s;t North-ea&s;t, the &s;everal inland Towns of <HI>Bolinbroke,</HI> famous for giving Birth and Title to King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. al&s;o Title to Mr. Secretary <HI>St. John,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Ge|nius's of the Age, tho' unhappy in &s;ome of his Politics; <HI>Spil&s;by, Hornca&s;tle,</HI> and <HI>Tatter&s;al,</HI> on the South.

<P><HI>Spil&s;by</HI> is a pretty good Town, and has a well-frequented Market.</P>
<P><HI>Hornca&s;tle</HI> is almo&s;t &s;urrounded with Water, and is a large well-built Town. But the re&s;t are incon|&s;iderable except <HI>Louth</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ter</HI>; the fir&s;t has Two weekly con&s;iderable Markets, and is famous for a fine Spire Steeple, as high as that of <HI>Grantham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;ter</HI> is the ancient <HI>Durobrivis,</HI> tho' <HI>Dornford</HI> retains &s;omewhat of the old Name, where the <HI>Her|men-&s;treet</HI> cro&s;s'd the River by a Bridge of Bra&s;s, ac|cording to the Vulgar. At <HI>Che&s;terton</HI> is a large Tract of Ground, call'd <HI>The Ca&s;tle-field,</HI> with a Ditch and Rampart around it. The <HI>Roman</HI> Road runs directly thro' it, and &s;till retains its high Ridge. Beyond the River it extends for &s;ome Space upon the Meadow along the Bank; then forms an Angle, and proceeds full North. <HI>Ca&s;ter</HI> is above half a Mile from it, upon the Hill. A Part of the Foundation of the Wall of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Camp is vi&s;ible in the Street to the North-we&s;t Corner of the Church, un|der the Wall of the Hou&s;e, where the Mini&s;ter lives. It may be known by the great Strength of the Mor|ter, built of the white Slab-&s;tone of the Country. Underneath this lay the City; for below the Church|yard
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the Ground is full of Foundations and <HI>Mo|&s;aics.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Boot</HI> Alehou&s;e Cellar is a Piece of a Pave|ment; as are many at Mr. <HI>Wright</HI>'s, and in a Gar|den an intire one; be&s;ides great Numbers of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mon&s;. <HI>Baillardeau.</HI> In the plough'd Fields between the Town and the Ri|ver, toward <HI>Fordgreen,</HI> is a Tract which runs quite thro', whereon Corn grows very &s;cantily. This is nothing but a Road laid with a deep Bed of Gravel, tho' the &s;uper&s;titious Country-people believe it was cur&s;ed by the Lady <HI>Kyneburg,</HI> the Abbe&s;s who built a religious Hou&s;e, which &s;tood Ea&s;tward of the Church, and &s;ome Part of which &s;till remains. This Meadow is call'd <HI>Norman-gate</HI> (or more properly, <HI>Dorman-gate</HI>) Field, from the Town, who&s;e Foun|dations are found all about this Place; and al&s;o innumerable Coins, call'd <HI>Dorman-pence.</HI> Part of this is <HI>Berry&s;tead,</HI> where Antiquities are daily dug up. <HI>Mill-field</HI> &s;tands higher toward <HI>Peterbo|rough,</HI> where Mo&s;aic Pavements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are found, and &s;eems to have been a little Citadel belonging to the Town.</P>
<P>Part of the Church is an antique Building, but new-modell'd. Upon a Stone over the Choir-door is a curious In&s;cription, importing that the Church was con&s;ecrated on the 17th of <HI>April</HI> 1114. The Steeple &s;tands in the Middle of the Church. The Tower is a fine Piece of antient Architecture with &s;emicircular Arches. The &s;quare Well by the Porch is <HI>Roman,</HI> &s;urrounded with hewn Stone; and tho' it &s;tands on a Hill, the Water is very high. At the Ea&s;t-end of the Church is a very old Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>A little higher up the River, near <HI>Wansford</HI> Bridge, a Gold <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Coin was found, which is in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Maurice John&s;on,</HI> an eminent Coun|&s;ellor.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">The <HI>Fen</HI> Country begins about <HI>Wainfleet,</HI> which is within Twenty Miles of <HI>Grim&s;by,</HI> and extends it|&s;elf to the I&s;le of <HI>Ely</HI> South, and to the Grounds oppo&s;ite to <HI>Lynn-regis</HI> in <HI>Norfolk</HI> Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>This Part is indeed very properly called <HI>Holland</HI>; for 'tis a flat, level, and often drowned Country, like the Province of the &s;ame Name in the <HI>Low Countries</HI>; in&s;omuch that the very Ditches are navigable, and the People pa&s;s from Town to Town in Boats, as they do there. Here we had the uncouth Mu&s;ick of the <HI>Bittern,</HI> a Bird formerly counted ominous and pre&s;aging, and which, as &s;ome &s;ay, thru&s;ts its Bill into a Reed, and others into a Bog, and then gives the dull, heavy Groan or Sound, like a Sigh; which is &s;o loud, that 'tis heard Two or Three Miles Di&s;tance as &s;ome People &s;ay.</P>
<P>Here we fir&s;t &s;aw <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and making towards it, found it a Sea-port Town, at the Mouth of the <HI>Wi|tham.</HI></P>
<P>The Tower is the highe&s;t and noble&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> being 100 Yards, and is &s;een plainly 40 Miles round this level Country, and farther by Sea. The Octa|gon Lantern on the Top is very beautiful, and ad|mirable for the Thinne&s;s of the Stone-work. Mari|ners find it particularly u&s;eful to guide them into this Port, and even into the Mouth of the River <HI>Ou&s;e</HI>; for in clear Weather 'tis &s;een quite out at Sea to the Entrance of tho&s;e Chanels, which they call <HI>Lynn Deeps,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton Deeps,</HI> which are as difficult Places as mo&s;t upon the Ea&s;tern Shore of <HI>Britain.</HI> This is particularly taken Notice of in an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of the late Queen <HI>Anne, for enabling A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments to be made for Repairing and keeping in Repair this Church:</HI> in the Preamble to which it is de|&s;cribed, as it de&s;erves, as an antient, well-built Fa|brick; that the Tower thereof is very high, and an u&s;eful Sea-mark; and that it being &s;ituate near the Haven, a great Sum is nece&s;&s;ary yearly to be rai&s;ed,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
to pre&s;erve it from a violent, con&s;tantly ebbing and flowing Water.</P>
<P>There was a prodigious Clock-Bell which could be heard Six or Seven Miles round; it had many old Ver&s;es round it, but <HI>Anno</HI> 1710. was knocked in Pieces, and the In&s;cription not taken.</P>
<P>Twenty Yards from the Foundation of this Tower runs the rapid <HI>Witham,</HI> thro' a wooden Bridge.</P>
<P>This Town abounded with religious Hou&s;es, who&s;e Lands King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. gave to the Town.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. was a great Benefactre&s;s likewi&s;e to it, and gave them Lands called <HI>Erection</HI> Lands, to pay a Vicar, Lecturer, and Two Schoolma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Church is reckon'd the large&s;t Pari&s;h-church without cro&s;s Ayles, in the Univer&s;e; 'tis 100 Feet wide, and 300 long within the Walls. The Roof is hand&s;omely ceiled with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oak, &s;upported by 24 tall and &s;lender Pillars.</P>
<P>Formerly the Town laboured under the Want of fre&s;h Water, which was a great Di&s;couragement to Merchants and others &s;ettling there. To remedy which Inconvenience, <HI>John Smyth</HI> of <HI>Heath,</HI> in the County of <HI>York,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> procur'd an Act of Parliament which pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> to inclo&s;e Two Acres of the great Common, called <HI>The We&s;t Fen,</HI> for a Pond or Ci&s;tern, and to erect a Water-hou&s;e and Mill upon the &s;aid Common, and other proper Edifices, and to lay Pipes from the Pond for &s;upplying the Town.</P>
<P>The Town is large, populous, and well-built, full of Merchants, and has a good Share of foreign Trade, as well as <HI>Lynn.</HI> 'Tis built on both Sides of the River <HI>Witham.</HI> It is a Corporation, governed by a Mayor, and 12 Aldermen. It has two Markets weekly, and a commodious Haven. Here is held one of tho&s;e annual Fairs, which pre&s;erve the antient Title of a <HI>Mart,</HI> whereof I remember only Four in <HI>England</HI> of any con&s;iderable Note, <HI>viz. Lynn, Gain&s;burgh,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="19">
<HI>Beverly,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Its Trade of late Years has not increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> was a Chapel called <HI>Hiptoft,</HI> and in the Town a Church dedicated to St. <HI>John,</HI> but both demoli&s;h'd. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> gave the Corporation a Court of Admiralty over all the Sea-coa&s;ts here|abouts.</P>
<P>The Country round this Place is all <HI>Fen</HI> and Mar&s;h Grounds, the Land is very rich, and feeds prodigious Numbers of large Sheep, and al&s;o Oxen of the large&s;t Size, the be&s;t of which are driven to <HI>London</HI> Market; and from this Part, as al&s;o from the Downs or Heath above-mentioned, comes, as I have before noted, a great Part of the Wool, known, as a cre|ditable Di&s;tinction, becau&s;e of its Finene&s;s, by the Name of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire Wool</HI>; which is &s;ent in great Quantities into <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> for the Manu|facturers of tho&s;e Countries, and indeed to &s;everal other of the trading Counties in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Fens are very con&s;iderable for their Extent; for they reach in Length, in &s;ome Places, 50 Miles, and in Breadth above 30: and as they are &s;o level, that there is no Interruption to the Sight, any Build|ing of extraordinary Height is &s;een a long Way. For Example, <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Steeple is &s;een upon <HI>Lincoln</HI> Heath, near 30 Miles; <HI>Peterborough</HI> and <HI>Ely</HI> Min|&s;ters are &s;een almo&s;t thoughout the whole Level; &s;o are the Spires of <HI>Lynn, Whittle&s;ea,</HI> and <HI>Crowland,</HI> &s;een at a very great Di&s;tance, which adds &s;ome Beauty to the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> we came on thro' the <HI>Fen</HI> Country to <HI>Holbech,</HI> a little Market-town, and &s;o on to <HI>Spald|ing,</HI> which is another Sea-port in the Level, but &s;tanding far within the Land on the River <HI>Welland,</HI> which almo&s;t inclo&s;es it. Here was nothing very remarkable to be &s;een as to Antiquity, but the Ruins of an old Mona&s;tery, of which the <HI>Mona&s;ticon</HI> gives a particular De&s;cription. There is a Bridge
<PB N="19" REF="20">
over the <HI>Welland,</HI> and Ve&s;&s;els of about 50 or 60 Tons may come up to the Town; and that is &s;uffi|cient for the Trade of <HI>Spalding,</HI> which is chiefly in Corn and Coal.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not pa&s;s by <HI>Crowland,</HI> another Place of great religious Antiquity, here being once a famous Mona&s;tery, the Remains of which are &s;till to be &s;een. The Monks of <HI>Crowland</HI> were eminent in Hi&s;tory, and a great many Stories are told of the Devils of <HI>Crowland</HI> al&s;o, and what Conver&s;ation they had with the Monks, which Tales are more out of Date now, than they were formerly.</P>
<P>The Abbey was founded 1000 Years ago by <HI>Athel|bald</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> in the mid&s;t of Bogs and Thorns, in Honour of his Chaplain <HI>Guthlac,</HI> who cho&s;e this Place to mortify in. The Foundation is laid on Piles of Wood, &s;everal of which have been found in tearing up the Ruins of the Ea&s;tern Part of the Church; for what remains is only Part of the We&s;t|end, and of that only one Corner in tolerable Re|pair, which is at pre&s;ent their Pari&s;h-church. In the Middle of the Cro&s;s &s;tood once a lofty Tower, and in it was a remarkably fine Ring of Bells; the fir&s;t, as is &s;aid in the County. The Roof, which was of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oak finely carv'd and gilt, fell down about 40 Years ago, and Pieces of it are to be found in almo&s;t every Hou&s;e. People at Plea&s;ure dig up the monumental Stones for private U&s;e, and what are left in the Pave|ment are cover'd over with Shrubs. It was made a Gari&s;on in the late Civil Wars, and the Soldiers de&s;troy'd the painted Gla&s;s in it. All the Ea&s;tern Part of the Body of the Church is intirely raz'd to the Foundation. The mona&s;tick Buildings, Cloi|&s;ters, Hall, Abbat's Lodgings, are ab&s;olutely demo|li&s;h'd. In the North-we&s;t Corner of the Church &s;tands a &s;trong Tower, with a very obtu&s;e Spire, and a plea&s;ant Ring of &s;mall Bells. Over the We&s;t Gate are the Images of divers Kings, Abbats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="21">
among the re&s;t, <HI>Guthlac</HI> with a Whip and Knife, his u&s;ual Symbols.</P>
<P>Not far from the Abbey, is the Remnant of a little Stone Cottage, called <HI>Anchor-church-hou&s;e,</HI> where was a Chapel, in which St. <HI>Guthlac</HI> was bury'd, and where he lived a Hermit.</P>
<P>Over-again&s;t the We&s;t-end of the Abbey, is the famous triangular Bridge, hardly to be equalled in <HI>Britain,</HI> if in <HI>Europe.</HI> It being too &s;teep for Hor&s;es and Carriages to go over, they pa&s;s under it. 'Tis formed on Three Segments of a Circle meeting in one Point; and each Ba&s;e, they &s;ay, &s;tands in a dif|ferent County. Here meet the Rivers <HI>Nyne</HI> and <HI>Welland.</HI> So that the Bridge, being fixed at the very Point where they join, &s;tands upon a Centre in the Middle of the united Waters; and then parting into Two Bridges, lands you one to the Right on <HI>Thorney,</HI> and one to the Left upon <HI>Holland.</HI> On one Side fits an Image of King <HI>Athelbald,</HI> Founder of <HI>Crow|land-Abbey,</HI> with a Globe in his Hand.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Spalding</HI> is not large, but pretty well built and well inhabited, and is a hand&s;ome and large Market-town; but for the Healthine&s;s or Plea|&s;antne&s;s of it, I have no more to &s;ay, than that I was very glad when I got out of it, as well as out of the re&s;t of the Fen Country; for 'tis a horrid Air for a Stranger to breathe in.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Draining the&s;e Fens, by a Set of Gentlemen, called the <HI>Adventurers</HI>; the &s;everal Laws for &s;ecuring and pre&s;erving the Banks, and di|viding the Lands; how they were by the extraordi|nary Conflux of Waters from all the Inland Coun|ties of <HI>England</HI> frequently overflowed, and &s;ome|times lay under Water mo&s;t Part of the Year; how all the Waters in this Part of <HI>England,</HI> which do not run into the <HI>Thames,</HI> the <HI>Trent,</HI> or the <HI>Severn,</HI> fall together into the&s;e low Grounds, and empty them&s;elves into the Sea by tho&s;e Drains, as thro' a
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Sink; and how by the Skill of the&s;e Adventurers, and at a prodigious Expence, they have cut new Chanels, and even whole Rivers, with particular Drains from one River to another, to carry off the great Flux of Waters, when Floods or Fre&s;hes come down either on one Side or on the other; and how, notwith|&s;tanding all that Hands could do, or Art contrive, yet &s;ometimes the Waters do &s;till prevail, the Banks break, and whole Levels are overflowed together; All this, and much more that might be &s;aid on &s;o co|pious a Subject, tho' it would be very u&s;eful to have it fully and geographically de&s;crib'd, yet it would take up &s;o much Room, that I cannot think of en|tering any farther into it, than ju&s;t to mention, That an Act of Parliament lately pa&s;&s;ed to enable the Adventurers, Owners, and Proprietors of the taxable Lands, and the Owners and Proprietors of the free Lands in <HI>Deeping Fen, Pinchbeck,</HI> and <HI>Spalding South Fen, Therlby Fen, Bourn South Fen,</HI> and <HI>Croyland Fen,</HI> &amp;c. in the County of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> containing in the Whole about 30,000 Acres, to rai&s;e a competent Sum for the effectual Draining and future Pre&s;ervation of all the &s;aid Fens, accord|ing to their Agreement in that behalf, dated <HI>Febr.</HI> 23.1737, and to carry the &s;aid Agreement into Execution.</P>
<P>We &s;hall only ob&s;erve further, that Sir <HI>John Heath|cote,</HI> Bart. hath made &s;o good a Progre&s;s in draining 366 Acres of the <HI>Therlby Fen</HI> Pa&s;tures, belonging to him, that he is particularly exempted from paying to|ward the Sums levied upon others by this Act.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fens of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> are of the &s;ame Kind with, and contiguous to, tho&s;e already mentioned in the I&s;le of <HI>Ely,</HI> in the Counties of <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon</HI>; and here, as well as there, we &s;ee pro|digious Numbers of Cattle, which are fed up to an extraordinary Size by the Richne&s;s of the Soil.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o an infinite Number of Wild-Fowl, &s;uch as Duck and Mallard, Teal and Wigeon, Brand-Gee&s;e,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Wild-Gee&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For the taking of the four fir&s;t Kinds, here are a great many <HI>Decoys,</HI> from all which the va&s;t Number of Fowls they take, are &s;ent up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Accounts which the Country People give of the Numbers they &s;ometimes take, are &s;uch, that one &s;carce dares report it from them. But this I can &s;ay, of my certain Knowlege, that &s;ome of the&s;e Decoys are of &s;o great an Extent, and take &s;uch great Num|bers of Fowl, that they are let from 100<HI>l.</HI> to 3, 4, and 500<HI>l.</HI> a Year Rent.</P>
<P>The Art of taking the Fowls, and e&s;peciaally of Breeding up a Set of Creatures, called <HI>Decoy-Ducks,</HI> to intice and then betray their Fellow-Ducks into the &s;everal Decoys, is very ingenious; and tho' 'tis not very ea&s;y to de&s;cribe it, I will give it in as few Words as I can.</P>
<P>The Decoy-Ducks are hatched and bred up in the Decoy Ponds; in which are certain Places where they are con&s;tantly fed, and being made tame, they are u&s;ed to come to the Decoy-Man's Hand for their Food.</P>
<P>When they fly abroad, it is not known whither they go, but &s;ome conjecture they fly quite over into <HI>Hol|land</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI>; where they meet with others of their own Kind, and &s;orting with them, they, by &s;ome Art, unknown to us, draw together a va&s;t Number of the Fowls, and, in a Word, <HI>kidnap</HI> them from their own Country; for being once brought out of their Knowlege, they follow the Decoys, as a Dog follows the Sport&s;man; and 'tis frequent to &s;ee the&s;e &s;ubtle Creatures return with a va&s;t Flight of Fowls along with them, after they have been ab|&s;ent &s;everal Weeks together.</P>
<P>When they have brought them over, the fir&s;t Thing they do is to &s;ettle with them in the Ponds, to which the Decoy-Ducks belong. Here they chatter and gabble to them in their own Language,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
as if they were telling them, that here they &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee how well they &s;hould live.</P>
<P>When the Decoy-Men perceive they are come, and that they are gathering and increa&s;ing, they go &s;ecretly to the Pond's Side, under the Cover which they have made with Reeds, &s;o that they cannot be &s;een, where they throw over the Reeds Handfuls of Corn, in &s;uch &s;hallow Places, as the Decoy-Ducks are u&s;ually fed, and whither they are &s;ure to come for it, and to bring their new Gue&s;ts with them for their Entertainment.</P>
<P>This they do for two or three Days together, and no Harm follows to the poor Strangers, till throwing in this Bait one time in an open wide Place, an|other time in another wide Place, the third time it is thrown in a narrower Place; where the Trees, which hang over the Water and the Banks, &s;tand clo&s;er together; and then in another yet narrower, where the &s;aid Trees are over-head like an Arbour, tho' at a good Height from the Water.</P>
<P>Here the Boughs are &s;o artfully managed, that a large Net is &s;pread near the Tops of the Trees among the Branches, and fa&s;tened to Hoops which reach from Side to Side. This is &s;o high, and &s;o wide, and the Room is &s;o much below, and the Water &s;o open, that the Fowls do not perceive the Net above them.</P>
<P>Here the Decoy-Man keeping un&s;een, behind the Hedges of Reeds, which are made perfectly clo&s;e, goes forward, throwing Corn over the Reeds into the Water. The Decoy-Ducks greedily fall upon it, and, calling their foreign Gue&s;ts, &s;eem to tell them, that now they may find, how well the Ducks live in <HI>England</HI>; &s;o inviting, or rather wheedling them forward, 'till by degrees they are all gotten under the Arch or Sweep of the Net, which is on the Trees, and which by degrees, imperceptibly to them, de|clines lower and lower, and al&s;o narrower and nar|rower,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
till at the farther End it comes to a Point like a Pur&s;e; though this farther End is quite out of Sight, and perhaps two or three hundred Yards from the fir&s;t Entrance.</P>
<P>When the whole Flight of Ducks are thus gree|dily following the Decoys, and feeding plentifully as they go; and the Decoy-Man &s;ees they are all &s;o far within the Arch of the Net, as not to be able to e&s;cape, on a &s;udden a Dog, which till then keeps clo&s;e by him, and which is perfectly taught his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, ru&s;hes from behind the Reeds, and jumps into the Water, &s;wimming directly after the Ducks, and barks as he &s;wims.</P>
<P>Immediately the frighted Ducks ri&s;e upon the Wing to make their E&s;cape; but are beaten down again by the arched Net, which is over their Heads. Being then forced into the Water, they nece&s;&s;arily &s;wim forward, for fear of the Dog; and thus they croud on, 'till by Degrees the Net growing lower and narrower, they are hurried to the very farther End, where another Decoy-Man &s;tands ready to receive them, and who takes them out alive with his Hands.</P>
<P>As for the Traitors, that drew the poor Ducks into this Snare, they are taught to ri&s;e but a little Way, and &s;o not reaching to the Net, they fly back to the Ponds, and make their E&s;cape; or el&s;e, being u&s;ed to the Decoy-Man, they go to him fearle&s;s, and are taken out as the re&s;t; but in&s;tead of being killed with them, are &s;trok'd, made much of, and put into a little Pond ju&s;t by him, and plentifully fed for their Services.</P>
<P>There are many Particulars in the managing and draining the&s;e Levels, throwing off the Water by Mills and Engines, and cultivating the Grounds in an unu&s;ual manner, which would be very u&s;eful to be de&s;cribed; but the needful Brevity of this Work, will not admit of it: yet &s;omething of it may be touched upon.<LIST>
<PB N="25" REF="26">
<ITEM>1. That here are &s;ome wonderful Engines for throwing up Water, and &s;uch as are not to be &s;een any-where el&s;e; whereof one in particular threw up (as they a&s;&s;ured us) 1200 Tons of Water in half an Hour, and goes by Wind-Sails, 12 Wings or Sails to a Mill.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Here are the greate&s;t Improvements by Plant|ing of Hemp, that, I think, are to be &s;een in <HI>England</HI>; particularly on the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> Sides of the <HI>Fens,</HI> as about <HI>Wi&s;bech, Wells,</HI> and &s;everal other Places, where we &s;aw many hundred Acres of Ground bearing great Crops of Hemp.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Here is a particular Trade carried on with <HI>London,</HI> which is no-where el&s;e practi&s;ed in the whole Kingdom, that I have met with, or heard of, <HI>viz.</HI> For carrying Fi&s;h alive by Land-Car|riage; this they do by carrying great Buts filled with Water in Waggons, as the Carriers draw other Goods. The Buts have a little &s;quare Flap, in&s;tead of a Bung, about 10, 12, or 14 Inches &s;quare, which, being opened, gives Air to the Fi&s;h: and every Night, when they come to the Inn, they draw off the Water, and let more fre&s;h and &s;weet Water run into them again. In the&s;e Carriages they chiefly carry Tench and Pike, Pearch and Eels, but e&s;pecially the two former, of which here are &s;ome of the large&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>

<P><HI>Whittle&s;ea</HI> and <HI>Ram&s;ey</HI> Meres are Two Lakes, made by the River <HI>Nyne,</HI> which runs through them; the fir&s;t is between Five and Six Miles long, and Three Miles broad, and is indeed full of excellent Fi&s;h for this Trade.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hermen-&s;treet</HI> goes in a &s;trait Line thro' great and little <HI>Stukely,</HI> antiently written <HI>Styvecle,</HI> which Name it acquir'd from its <HI>&s;tiff clay</HI> Soil. In <HI>Great Stukely</HI> Church is a Font of a very antique Make.
<PB N="26" REF="27">
The <HI>Hermen-&s;treet,</HI> after this, becomes notorious by the Name of <HI>Stangate.</HI> Near <HI>Stilton</HI> &s;ome Parts ap|pear &s;till pav'd with Stone, which &s;trengthens the Conjecture, that the Name <HI>Stangate</HI> was given it from thence. It traver&s;es great Woods between the Two <HI>Saltries,</HI> where was a religious Foundation of <HI>Simon Silvanect,</HI> the &s;econd Earl of <HI>Huntingdon</HI> and <HI>Northampton</HI>; among the Ruins of which lie bu|ried <HI>Robert Brus,</HI> Lord of <HI>Anandale</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>Cleveland</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> with <HI>I&s;abel</HI> his Con|&s;ort, from whom the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Branch of our Royal Family is de&s;cended. Near the Road Side <HI>Roman</HI> Urns have been dug up.</P>
<P>Half a Mile out of the Road is the Seat of Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> the learned Friend of the great <HI>Cam|den,</HI> where he had a choice Collection of <HI>Roman</HI> In|&s;criptions from all Parts of the Kingdom. The Hou&s;e was built in a magnificent manner of hewn Stone; but now lies in di&s;mal Ruins. By it is a mo&s;t beautiful Church, with a Tower; and in the Windows is fine painted Gla&s;s. From tho&s;e Woods above-mention'd, your Eye commands the whole Level of the Fens, particularly <HI>Whitle&s;ey-mere,</HI> where the Gentry have little Ve&s;&s;els to &s;ail in for Plea&s;ure. Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> digging the Foundation of a Hou&s;e on the Hill whence you enjoy this Pro&s;pect, found the Skeleton of a Fi&s;h, 12 Feet long.</P>
<P>A little to the Right lies <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> famed for a rich Abbey; little of which is now left, but a Part of the old Gate-hou&s;e. In the Yard I &s;aw a ne|glected Statue of the Founder <HI>Alwyn,</HI> who was called <HI>Alderman of all</HI> England, and was Cou&s;in to King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and Son of Duke <HI>Athel&s;tan,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Half-King.</HI> This is one of the mo&s;t antient Pieces of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sculpture which we know of. The Keys and ragged Staff in his Hand denote his Office. The Abbey was dedicated to St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> and St. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> and was a rich Foun|dation,

<P>At every Mile from <HI>Grantham</HI> to <HI>Stangate</HI> are Stones &s;et up by Mr. <HI>Boulter,</HI> which he de&s;ign'd to have carry'd on to <HI>London,</HI> for the general Benefit.</P>
<P>All the Country between <HI>Huntingdon</HI> River and <HI>Peterborough</HI> River, is Clay, Sand, and Gravel; but beyond that, to the <HI>Humber,</HI> Stone.</P>
<P>At <HI>Gunworth</HI> Ferry over <HI>Peterborough</HI> River is a Bridge, a few Years ago erected, where Boats pay Toll. The People of <HI>Peterborough</HI> were a good while aver&s;e to having their River made navigable, out of an ab&s;urd Notion, that it would &s;poil their Trade. But they begin to be better inform'd, or, as I may &s;ay, to have more Wit, on the Progre&s;s made in that Navigation, which I &s;hall mention more par|ticularly by-and-by, when I come to <HI>Oundle.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Fens,</HI> longing to be delivered from Fogs, and &s;tagnate Air, and Water of the Colour of brewed Ale, like the Rivers of the <HI>Peak,</HI> we fir&s;t &s;et Foot on dry Land, <HI>as I called it,</HI> at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>But before we enter it, we mu&s;t not omit to take &s;ome Notice of <HI>Foderinghay</HI> Ca&s;tle, &s;ituate on a Branch of the <HI>Nyne,</HI> famous for the Impri&s;onment and Decollation of the unfortunate <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI> It &s;eems to have been very &s;trong, and it had a high Mount or Keep, inviron'd with a deep Ditch. 'Tis mo&s;tly demoli&s;h'd, and all the Materials carry'd off; &s;ome &s;ay it was de&s;troy'd by Order of King <HI>James</HI> I. in Revenge of his Mother's Sufferings. They pretended to &s;hew me here the Ruins of the Hall, where that Prince&s;s was beheaded. It was the Seat of <HI>Edmund</HI> of <HI>Langley,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who&s;e Body was bury'd in the Collegiate Church here; a

very neat Building founded by <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> likewi&s;e interred here. The Chancel in which they were bury'd, was intirely demoli&s;hed at the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion; but the&s;e Monuments were re&s;tored by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The Church Windows are filled with hand&s;ome painted Gla&s;s, &s;av'd by a Sum of Money to the Soldiery in the late Civil War, and repre&s;ent St. <HI>Denys,</HI> St. <HI>Guthlac,</HI> Abp. <HI>Scrope,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Peterborough</HI> &s;tands in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> and is a little City of great Antiquity &s;eated on the River <HI>Nyne,</HI> and indeed 'tis the lea&s;t in <HI>England</HI>; for <HI>Bath,</HI> or <HI>Wells,</HI> or <HI>Ely,</HI> or <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> are all much big|ger; yet <HI>Peterborough</HI> is no contemptible Place nei|ther. Here are &s;ome good Hou&s;es, a hand&s;ome Mar|ket-place, and the Streets are fair and well-built; but the Glory of <HI>Peterborough</HI> is the Cathedral, which is truly fine and beautiful, and the noble&s;t Piece of <HI>Gothick</HI> Building in <HI>England</HI>; but it appears to be more modern, than the Story of rai&s;ing this Pile implies, which was near 1050 Years ago. It wants only, to make it complete, a fine Tower Steeple, and Spire on the Top of it. A Mayor, Aldermen, and Recorder, are the chief Magi&s;trates here.</P>
<P>In this Church was buried the Body of the un|happy <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> above-mentioned, but it was afterwards removed by King <HI>James</HI> I. her Son, into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> where a Monu|ment is erected for her, in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIth's Chapel; tho' &s;ome do not &s;tick to tell us, that tho' the Monument was erected, the Body was never remov'd.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o lies interred <HI>Catharine</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> another unhappy Queen, and the divorc'd Wife of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and Mother to Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. Her Monument is not very magnificent, but 'tis far from mean. Here is an old decayed Monument of Bi&s;hop <HI>Wulfer,</HI> the Founder of the Church; but this Church has &s;o often been burnt and demoli&s;hed &s;ince tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="29" REF="30">
Time, that 'tis doubtful, whether the Monument be authentick or not.</P>
<P>In the Cathedral is the Figure of one <HI>Scarlet,</HI> a Sexton, who buried the above named Two Queens, one 50 Years after the other, and under it the fol|lowing In&s;cription:
<Q><L><HI>You &s;ee old</HI> Scarlet<HI>'s Picture &s;tand on high,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But at your Feet there doth his Body lie.</HI></L>
<L><HI>He did interr Two Queens within this Place,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And this Town's Hou&s;holders in his Life's Space</HI></L>
<L><HI>Twice over; but at length his own Turn came:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Another Man for him &s;hould do the &s;ame.</HI></L></Q>
He died at 95 Years old.</P>
<P>The Chapel here, called St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, is a very cu|rious Building, tho' now not in U&s;e. The Choir has been often repaired and beautify'd, and is now very fine; but the We&s;t End, or great Gate, is a Prodigy for Beauty and Variety. 'Tis remarkable, that as this Church, when a Mona&s;tery, was famous for its great Revenues, &s;o now, as reduced, 'tis one of the poore&s;t Bi&s;hopricks in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1720. at <HI>Thorp,</HI> the Seat of Sir <HI>Francis St. John,</HI> by <HI>Peterborough,</HI> a Mo&s;aick Pavement was found. This was undoubtedly a <HI>Villa</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> of Di&s;tinction. In the Garden are &s;ome fine antique Marble Statues, which &s;uffer more from the Wea|ther than from Age. In the Middle is a <HI>Livia</HI> of a <HI>Colo&s;&s;ean</HI> Proportion: in the Four Quarters, <HI>Diana, Amphion,</HI> an Orator, and a Gladiator: upon the Terrace, an admirable <HI>Hercules</HI> killing the <HI>Hydra:</HI> in the Court, Two Eque&s;trian Figures in Copper, King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> and Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> Over mo&s;t of the Doors of the Hou&s;e, are placed Bu&s;toes of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ianus, Caracalla,</HI> and others. The&s;e Antiquities were of the <HI>Arundel</HI> Collection.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">As great Part of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> which is a va&s;tly extended County, remained yet un&s;een by me, I was obliged to turn North from <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and take a View of the <HI>Fens</HI> again, tho' we kept them at &s;ome Di&s;tance too. Here we pa&s;s'd the <HI>Welland</HI> at <HI>Mar|ket Deeping,</HI> an old, ill-built and dirty Town. Then we went thro' <HI>Bourn</HI> to <HI>Folkingham,</HI> near which we &s;aw two Pieces of decay'd Magnificence; one was the old demoli&s;h'd Mona&s;tery of <HI>Sempringham,</HI> the Seat of the <HI>Gilbertine</HI> Nuns, famous for Au&s;terity; and the other was the antient Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Admiral, where that great and noble Per&s;on once lived in the utmo&s;t Splendor. The Hou&s;e, tho' in its full Decay, &s;hews what it has been, and the Plai&s;ter of the Ceilings and Walls in &s;ome Rooms is &s;o fine, &s;o firm, and &s;o intire, that they break it off in large Flakes, and it will bear Writing on with a Pencil or Steel Pen, like the Leaves of a Table-book. This Sort of Plai|&s;ter I have not &s;een any-where &s;o prodigiou&s;ly fine, except in the Palace of <HI>None&s;uch</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> near <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> before it was demoli&s;hed by the Lord <HI>Berkley.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we cro&s;s'd Part of the great Heath mentioned before, and came into the high Road again at <HI>Anca&s;ter,</HI> a &s;mall, but antient <HI>Roman</HI> Village, call'd <HI>Segeloci.</HI> It is full of Remnants of Antiquity; a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of which may be deduc'd from the Traffick which the Town's-people have for many Years carry'd on with the Sale of them. After a Shower the Schoolboys and Shepherds look for them on the Declivities, and never return empty.</P>
<P>The Town con&s;i&s;ts of one Street, running North and South along the Road. There is a Spring at both Ends of the Town, which, no doubt, was the Rea&s;on for the <HI>Romans</HI> pitching it at this Place; for there is no more Water from hence to <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>On the We&s;t Side of the Town is a Road, for|merly de&s;ign'd for the Convenience of tho&s;e who
<PB N="31" REF="32">
travelled when the Gates were &s;hut. In the Church|yard are two Prie&s;ts cut in Stone.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t have been a populous Place, from the large Quarries about it, and the Rock lying a very little way beneath the Surface.</P>
<P>From <HI>Anca&s;ter</HI> we came to <HI>Grantham,</HI> famous for a very fine Church, and its Spire Steeple. The ge|neral Notion, that this Steeple &s;tands leaning, is cer|tainly a vulgar Error: I had no In&s;trument indeed to judge it by, but, according to the &s;tricte&s;t Ob&s;erv|ation, I could not perceive it, or any thing like it, and am much of Opinion with that excellent Poet:
<Q><L><HI>'Tis Height makes</HI> Grantham <HI>Steeple &s;tand awry.</HI></L></Q>
The chief Magi&s;trate here is an Alderman, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Twelve Ju&s;tices. This is a neat, plea&s;ant, well-built and populous Town, has a good Market, and the Inhabitants are &s;aid to have a very good Trade, and to be generally rich.</P>
<P>It was certainly a <HI>Roman</HI> Town, and Remains of a Ca&s;tle have been formerly dug up there. The Spire Steeple is 100 Yards high, and equalled only by an|other in this County at <HI>Louth,</HI> be&s;ides the Tower of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Here were many Religious Hou&s;es: Ruins of &s;ome of which &s;till remain. In one ju&s;t by the Market-place, is a very pretty little Chapel or Ora|tory adorned with Imagery. Here is a good Free|&s;chool, erected by <HI>Richard Fox,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;tor</HI>; where Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> received the fir&s;t Principles of Literature, under the famous <HI>William Walker,</HI> then Schoolma&s;ter. This Town lying on the great Northern Road is famous, as well as <HI>Stamford,</HI> for abundance of very good Inns, &s;ome of them fit to entertain Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality, and their Retinues, and it is a great Advantage to the Place.</P>
<P>Within a Mile of <HI>Grantham</HI> &s;tands <HI>Belton,</HI> a late-built Hou&s;e belonging to the Family of <HI>Brownlow,</HI> Lord <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> one of the mo&s;t regular

<P>From a Hill, about a Mile beyond this Town North-we&s;t, being on the great <HI>York</HI> Road, we had a Pro&s;pect again into the Vale of <HI>Bever,</HI> or <HI>Belvoir.</HI> which I mentioned before; and which &s;preads it&s;elf here into three Counties, to wit, <HI>Lincoln, Leice&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Rutland&s;hires:</HI> al&s;o here we had a di&s;tant View of <HI>Belvoir</HI> Ca&s;tle, which, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, took its Name from the Situation, from whence there is &s;o fine a Pro&s;pect over the Country, that you &s;ee from the Hill into <HI>Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Leice&s;ter, Rutland,</HI> and <HI>Northampton&s;hires.</HI> The Ca&s;tle or Palace (for &s;uch it now is) of <HI>Belvoir</HI> is the Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Manners,</HI> Dukes of <HI>Rutland,</HI> who have al&s;o a very noble E&s;tate, equal to the Deme&s;nes of &s;ome Sovereign Princes, extending it&s;elf into <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Derby&s;hires</HI> far and wide, and in which E&s;tate they have an immen&s;e &s;ubter|ranean Trea&s;ure, never to be exhau&s;ted; I mean the Lead-mines and Coal-pits, of which I &s;hall &s;ay more in their Place.</P>

in <HI>England</HI> (which abounds with &s;o many fine ones) that excel in this or that Particular; I do not know a Hou&s;e in <HI>Britain,</HI> which excels all the re&s;t in &s;o many Particulars.</P>
<P>I cannot help mentioning here, that I was drawn to make a Vi&s;it, in my Journey, to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Edward Roberts</HI> of <HI>Gla&s;ton,</HI> in this little County, purely for the &s;ake of his excellent Character; and we were received by him with great Courte&s;y. This Gentleman had a very &s;mall Living in the County, the Income of which, with the Surplus of his E&s;tate, he devoted to the Ne|ce&s;&s;itous; and of late Years had provided him&s;elf with all Sorts of Medicines from <HI>London,</HI> &s;o that his Time was &s;pent in relieving the Poor in a double Capacity, as a Divine and a Phy&s;ician. He often refu&s;ed Promotions in the Church, tho' his Rector|&s;hip was accounted the poore&s;t in the County; he di&s;approved Pluralities, and always look'd with Love on his Pari&s;h, as his Family: but this excellent Clergyman died a few Months after we were there, in <HI>March</HI> 1739-40, univer&s;ally lamented. His Brother, <HI>Thomas Roberts,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> died about Twelve Months before him, with as good a Character for a Lawyer, as this Gentleman had for a Divine; for he would give his Advice <HI>gratis,</HI> as well as his Practice, to all without Exception; and tho' a great Friend to the pre&s;ent Royal Family, would never accept of Place or Pen&s;ion, and never would interfere in Elections, which he thought &s;hould always be left free, and uninfluenced.</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>St. Martins,</HI> and &s;topp'd at the <HI>George,</HI> out of Curio&s;ity, becau&s;e it is reckoned one of the greate&s;t Inns in <HI>England,</HI> and thence pro|ceeded to <HI>Stamford.</HI> This Town is placed in a kind of an Angle of the County of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> ju&s;t upon the Edge of Three Counties, <HI>viz. Lincoln, North|ampton,</HI> and <HI>Rutland:</HI> this Town boa&s;ts greatly too
<PB N="35" REF="36">
of its Antiquity, and indeed it has evident Marks of its having been a very great Place in former Days.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells us it was burnt by the <HI>Danes</HI> above 1500 Years ago, being then a flouri&s;hing City: it was al&s;o once an Univer&s;ity, and here are &s;till the Remains of Two Colleges, one called <HI>Blackhall,</HI> and the other <HI>Brazen No&s;e</HI>; on the Gate whereof is a great <HI>Brazen No&s;e,</HI> and a Ring through it, like that at <HI>Oxford</HI>; nor could it take this from <HI>Oxford,</HI> but <HI>Oxford</HI> from that, which is as old as <HI>Edward</HI> III. at the lea&s;t, while that at <HI>Oxford</HI> was not built before <HI>Henry</HI> VII. But the famous Camps, and Military Ways, which &s;till appear at and near this Town, are a more vi&s;ible Te&s;timony of its having been a very antient Town, and that it was con&s;iderable in the <HI>Romans</HI> Time.</P>
<P>It is now a very fair, well-built, and wealthy Town, con&s;i&s;ting of Six Pari&s;hes, including that of <HI>St. Martin</HI> in <HI>Stamford-baron</HI>; that is to &s;ay, in that Part of the Town which &s;tands over the River, which, tho' it is not a Part of the Town, criti|cally &s;peaking, being not in the Liberty, and in an|other County, yet 'tis all called <HI>Stamford,</HI> and is rated with it in the Taxes.</P>
<P>The Government of this Town is by a Mayor and Aldermen, and not, as &s;ome write, by an Alder|man, and 12 Comburge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>They boa&s;t in this Town of very great Privileges, e&s;pecially to their Mayor; &s;uch as being freed from the Sheriff's Juri&s;diction, and from being impanelled on Juries out of the Town; to have the Return of all Writs, to be freed from all Lords-Lieutenants, and from their Mu&s;ters, and for having the Militia of the Town commanded by their own Officers, the Mayor being the King's Lord-Lieutenant, and im|mediately under his Maje&s;ty's Command, and to be e&s;teemed (within the Liberties and Juri&s;diction of the Town) the &s;econd Man in the Kingdom; and
<PB N="36" REF="37">
the Grant of tho&s;e Privileges concludes thus: <HI>Ut ab antiquo u&s;u fuerunt,</HI> As of antient Time they had been accu&s;tomed: &s;o that this Charter, which was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> IV. <HI>Anno</HI> 1461, &s;eems to be only a Confirmation of former Privileges, not a Grant of new ones.</P>
<P>In the Church of <HI>St. Martin</HI> in <HI>Stamford-baron,</HI> is a very noble Monument of <HI>William Cecil</HI> Lord <HI>Burleigh,</HI> who lies buried there in a large Vault ju&s;t under it; and oppo&s;ite to it, on the North Side, is a more antient (but hand&s;ome) Monument, tho' not &s;o magnificent as the former, in Memory of <HI>Richard Cecil,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Jane</HI> his Wife, the Father and Mother of the &s;aid famous Lord <HI>Burleigh</HI>; al&s;o a more modern Monument for the great Earl who re|edify'd the Hou&s;e; and for his Counte&s;s, a Si&s;ter of the late Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire:</HI> this is a fini&s;hed Piece, 'tis all of the fine&s;t Marble, and was made at <HI>Florence,</HI> and &s;ent over. The &s;aid Earl died on his Return from <HI>Rome,</HI> at <HI>I&s;&s;y</HI> near <HI>Paris, Aug.</HI> 29. 1700.</P>
<P>There is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River <HI>Welland</HI> of Five Arches, and the Town-hall is in the Upper-part of the Gate, upon or at the End of the Bridge, which is a very hand&s;ome Building. Here are Two con&s;tant Weekly Markets, Three annual Fairs, and a great Midlent Mart; but the latter is not now &s;o con&s;iderable, as it is reported to have been formerly.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of <HI>Stamford</HI> is the Neighbourhood of the noble Palace of the Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> called <HI>Burleigh-hou&s;e,</HI> built by the &s;aid Lord <HI>Burleigh,</HI> Lord High Trea&s;urer to Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>This Hou&s;e is &s;ituated in <HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI>; it is built all of Free-&s;tone, looks more like a Town than a Hou&s;e, at which Avenue &s;oever you come to it; the Towers and the Pinacles &s;o high, and placed at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from one another, look like &s;o
<PB N="37" REF="38">
many di&s;tant Pari&s;h Churches in a great Town; and a large Spire covered with Lead, over the Clock in the Centre, looks like the Cathedral, or chief Church of the Town.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e &s;tands on an Eminence, which ri&s;es from the North Entrance of the Park, coming from <HI>Stamford:</HI> on the other Side, <HI>viz.</HI> South and We&s;t, the Country lies on a Level with the Hou&s;e, and is a fine Plain, with Po&s;ts, and other Marks for Hor&s;e-races. As the Entrance looks towards the flat low Grounds of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> it gives the Hou&s;e a mo&s;t extraordinary Pro&s;pect into the <HI>Fens,</HI> &s;o that you may &s;ee from thence near 30 Miles, without any thing to intercept the Sight.</P>
<P>As you mount the Hill, you come to a fine E&s;pla|nade, before the great Gate, or fir&s;t Entrance of the Hou&s;e, where is a &s;mall, but very hand&s;ome Semicircle, taken in with an Iron Balu&s;trade; and from this, ri&s;ing a few Steps, you enter a mo&s;t no|ble Hall, but made infinitely more noble by the in|valuable Paintings, with which it is &s;o filled, that there is not room to place any thing between them.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> Grandfather of his pre&s;ent Lord&s;hip, had a great Genius for Painting and Archi|tecture, and a &s;uperior Judgment in both, as every Part of this noble Structure will te&s;tify; for he changed the whole Face of the Building, pulled down great Part of the Front next the Garden, and turned the old <HI>Gothick</HI> Windows into tho&s;e &s;pacious Sa&s;hes which are now &s;een there; and tho' the Founder, who had al&s;o an exqui&s;ite Ta&s;te, (as the Manner of Buildings then was) had &s;o well ordered the Situation and Avenues of the whole Fabrick, that nothing was wanting of that Kind, and had al&s;o contrived the Hou&s;e it&s;elf in a mo&s;t magnificent manner, the Rooms &s;pacious, the Ceilings lofty, and the Deco|rations ju&s;t; yet the late Earl found Room for Al|terations, infinitely to the Advantage of the Whole;
<PB N="38" REF="39">
as particularly, a noble Stair-ca&s;e, a whole Suite of fine Apartments, with Rooms of State, fit for the Entertainment of a Prince, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on the Garden Side.</P>
<P>As the noble Lord above-mentioned loved Paint|ings, &s;o he had infinite Advantage in procuring them; for he not only travelled Three times into <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;tay'd every time a con&s;iderable while at <HI>Florence</HI>; but his princely Deportment, and fine Accompli&s;h|ments, procured him the per&s;onal E&s;teem of the Great Duke, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the Purchace of many excellent Pieces, and likewi&s;e pre&s;ented him with &s;everal others of great Value.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, there is, in the great Hall, his Lord&s;hip's Picture on Hor&s;eback, done by the Great Duke's principal Painter, at his Highne&s;s's Charge, and given to his Lord&s;hip, as a Mark of &s;pecial Fa|vour: there is al&s;o a fine Piece of <HI>Seneca</HI> bleeding to Death in the warm Bath, and dictating his la&s;t Morals to his Scholars; a Piece &s;o excellent, that I have been told, the late King of <HI>France</HI> offered the Earl 6000 Pi&s;toles for it.</P>
<P>The Stair-ca&s;e, the Ceilings of all the fine Lodg|ings, the Chapel, the Hall, the late Earl's Clo&s;et, are all finely painted by the celebrated VARRIO, whom the Earl kept 12 Years in his Family, wholly imploy'd in them, and allow'd him a Coach and Hor&s;es, an Equipage, a Table, and Servants, and a very con&s;iderable Pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the Park Wall, or, as &s;ome think, thro' the Park, adjoining to <HI>Burleigh-hou&s;e,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed an old <HI>Roman</HI> Highway, beginning at <HI>Ca&s;ter,</HI> a little Village near <HI>Peterborough</HI>; but which was antiently the <HI>Roman</HI> Station, or Colony, <HI>Durobrevum,</HI> as I have &s;aid. This whole Town takes in Three Squares of full 300 Feet each, two of which are allotted to the Ca&s;tle: the third is an Area lying to the Ea&s;t before it, be|tween the Ca&s;tle and the Hill, which is &s;till the
<PB N="39" REF="40">
Market-place. From under the Ca&s;tle-walls, almo&s;t quite round, ri&s;e many quick Springs; but of the&s;e the <HI>Syfer</HI> Spring is the mo&s;t noted, having now Four Fluxes of Water from between the Joints of great Stones, laid flat like a Wall, and join'd together with Lead, probably by the <HI>Romans,</HI> being under their Wall. It is very plea&s;antly over&s;haded with Trees. Its Name is <HI>Saxon,</HI> and &s;ignifies <HI>pure,</HI> which Appellation it well de&s;erves. The <HI>Roman</HI> Way is &s;till to be &s;een, and is now called <HI>The Forty-feet Way,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Gunworth Ferry</HI> (and <HI>Peterborough</HI>) to <HI>Stamford:</HI> This was, as the Antiquaries are of Opinion, the great Road into the <HI>North,</HI> which is &s;ince turned from <HI>Stilton</HI> in <HI>Huntingdon&s;hire,</HI> to <HI>Wand&s;worth</HI> or <HI>Wandsford,</HI> where is a very good Bridge over the the River <HI>Nyne</HI>; which coming down from <HI>North|ampton,</HI> as I have ob&s;erved already, pa&s;&s;ed thence by <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and &s;o into the <HI>Fen</HI> Country. But I am of Opinion, neither this nor <HI>Wandsford</HI> was the antient <HI>Northern</HI> Road u&s;ed by the <HI>Romans</HI>; for 'tis evident, that the great <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;way is &s;till &s;een on the Left-hand of that Road, and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Nyne</HI> at a Place called <HI>Water Neuton,</HI> went directly to <HI>Stamford,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Welland,</HI> ju&s;t above that Town, but not in the Place where the Bridge &s;tands now; and this <HI>Roman</HI> Way is &s;till to be &s;een, both on the South and the North Side of the <HI>Welland,</HI> &s;tretching it&s;elf on to <HI>Brig Ca&s;terton,</HI> a little Town upon the River <HI>Gua&s;h,</HI> about Three Miles beyond <HI>Stamford</HI>; which was, as all Writers agree, another <HI>Roman</HI> Station, and was called <HI>Gua&s;ennae</HI> by the An|tients, from whence the River is &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o to take its Name; whence it went on to <HI>Panton,</HI> an|other very con&s;iderable Colony, and &s;o to <HI>Newark,</HI> where it cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Fo&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Hence the Road goes by <HI>Stretton</HI>; then leaves a little on the Left-hand <HI>Col&s;terworth,</HI> highly memo|rable
<PB N="40" REF="41">
for being the Birth-place of the great Philo&s;opher, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Forty-foot Way</HI> then mu&s;t be a Cro&s;s-road from <HI>Ca&s;ter,</HI> and by that from the <HI>Fen</HI> Country, &s;o leading into the great Highway at <HI>Stamford:</HI> as like|wi&s;e another Cro&s;s-road went out of the &s;aid great Road at <HI>Panton,</HI> a Village of Antiquity near <HI>Anca&s;ter,</HI> to the Town of <HI>Anca&s;ter,</HI> where a <HI>Roman</HI> Cohort was &s;tationed, and thence joined the <HI>Fo&s;s</HI> again at <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>Near this little Village of <HI>Ca&s;ter</HI> lives the Lord <HI>Fitzwilliams,</HI> of an antient Family, but of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Title; his Lord&s;hip &s;ome Years ago built a very fine Stone Bridge over the River <HI>Nyne,</HI> near <HI>Gunworth,</HI> where formerly was the Ferry, as I have mentioned before; for the pa&s;&s;ing of which in a Coach, we paid 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>As we pa&s;s by <HI>Burleigh-park</HI> Wall, on the great Road, we &s;ee on the We&s;t Side, not above a Mile from it, another Hou&s;e, built by the &s;ame Lord <HI>Burleigh,</HI> and which might pa&s;s for a very noble Seat, <HI>were not</HI> Burleigh <HI>by.</HI> This is called <HI>Wathorp,</HI> and &s;tands ju&s;t on the great <HI>Roman</HI> Way, mentioned above; this is the Hou&s;e of which the old Earl is reputed to have &s;aid, he built it to <HI>remove to, and to be out of the Du&s;t, while</HI> Burleigh-hou&s;e <HI>was &s;weeping.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we went to <HI>Oundle,</HI> being told that the famous Drum was to be heard at that time in the Well; but tho' we &s;aw the Well, we heard no Drum, or any Noi&s;e at all. No Doubt, it is owing, if there be any thing in it, to the Pa&s;&s;age of the Water and Air. Here are two long Stone Bridges. <HI>Lowick</HI> Church, on the Side of a Hill, is very fine. The Monuments of the Founder <HI>John de Drayton,</HI> of the <HI>Veres</HI> and <HI>Staffords,</HI> Earl of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. are to be &s;een here: as is that of the late Duche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who, after her Divorce, married Sir <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="42">
<HI>Germayn,</HI> of <HI>Drayton-hou&s;e,</HI> who in a manner in|tirely new built this antient Seat.</P>
<P><HI>Oundle</HI> is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the River, over which it has Two hand&s;ome Stone Bridges. It is a neat, uniform-built Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nyne</HI> has a Range of eminent Towns along the Banks of it; <HI>viz. Northampton, Wellingborough, Higham-ferris, Thrap&s;ton, Oundle, Foderinghay, Wand&s;|ford</HI> and <HI>Peterborough,</HI> all in this County. The two fir&s;t I have already mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Higham-ferris</HI> is a &s;mall neat and healthful Mayor-town, plea&s;antly &s;eated on a ri&s;ing Ground, and is al&s;o an antient Borough.</P>
<P><HI>Thrap&s;ton</HI> is delightfully &s;ituated in a fine Valley, and &s;urrounded wlth a rich Soil, and well water'd. It has a fine Bridge over the <HI>Nyne</HI>; but is not emi|nent either for Trade or Buildings; tho' it will pro|bably &s;oon change its Face by virtue of an Act pa&s;&s;ed for making the <HI>Nyne</HI> navigable; which has had &s;o good an Effect, that, when I was la&s;t there, the 17th of <HI>November</HI> 1737, on that very Day Boats were brought up to <HI>Thrap&s;ton</HI> for the fir&s;t time, which occa&s;ioned much Joy in the Town.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o is a mo&s;t beautiful Range of Meadows and Pa&s;tures, perhaps not to be equalled in <HI>England</HI> for Length. They &s;tretch, uninterrupted, from <HI>Peterborough</HI> to <HI>Northampton,</HI> which is near 30 Miles in Length, and in &s;ome Places are near two Miles in Breadth; the Land rich, the Gra&s;s fine, and the Cattle which feed on them, hardly to be number'd.</P>
<P>North-we&s;t of this River lies <HI>Kettering,</HI> a hand|&s;ome well-frequented Town upon a ri&s;ing Ground; and beyond that again is <HI>Rothwell,</HI> a pretty good Market-town.</P>
<P>From <HI>Oundle</HI> we travelled North-ea&s;t into <HI>Yarley</HI> in <HI>Huntingdon&s;hire,</HI> a little Town tolerably well built.
<PB N="42" REF="43">
The Church has a neat lofty Spire. In our Way hither we cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> Way. At <HI>Overton,</HI> now called <HI>Cherry Orton,</HI> a Village near <HI>Gunworth</HI> Ferry, is an old Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, formerly belonging to a very antient and almo&s;t forgotten Family of great Men, called <HI>Lovetoft.</HI> On the other Side of the River, is the fine Hou&s;e I mentioned before, belong|ing to Sir <HI>Francis St. John,</HI> Bart. which affords a very beautiful Pro&s;pect to Travellers, as they pa&s;s from the Hill beyond <HI>Stilton</HI> to <HI>Wandsford</HI> Bridge. This <HI>Wandsford</HI> has obtained an idle Addition to its Name, from a Story firmly believed by the Country People; <HI>viz.</HI> That a great Flood coming ha&s;tily down the River <HI>Nyne,</HI> in Hay-making-time, a Country Fellow, having taken up his Lodging on a Cock of Hay in the Meadow, was driven, on the Hay, down the Stream in the Night, while he was fa&s;t a&s;leep, towards <HI>Wisbech</HI> in the <HI>Fens</HI>; when being wakened, he was &s;een and taken up by &s;ome Fi&s;hermen, almo&s;t in the open Sea; and being a&s;ked, Where he lived? he an&s;wered, <HI>At</HI> Wansford <HI>in</HI> England. And we &s;aw at the great Inn, by the South End of the Bridge, the Sign of a Man floating on a Cock of Hay, and over him written <HI>Wandsford in England.</HI></P>
<P>Falling down Southward we come to <HI>Stilton,</HI> a Town famous for Chee&s;e, which is called our <HI>Engli&s;h Parme&s;an,</HI> and is brought to Table &s;o full of Mites or Maggots, that they u&s;e a Spoon to eat them. We came again into the <HI>Roman</HI> Way at <HI>Stilton,</HI> which comes from <HI>Ca&s;ter</HI> aforementioned, and runs all the way to <HI>Huntingdon</HI>; which we followed thro' <HI>Sautery-lane,</HI> a deep De&s;cent between two Hills, in which is <HI>Stangate-hole,</HI> noted for being the greate&s;t Robbing-place in all this Part of the County, and &s;o came to <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> antiently called <HI>Hunters-dune,</HI> the County-town, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Ground, on the North Side of the <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI> It is a great Thorough|fair on the Northern Road, and is full of very good
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Inns, and is a &s;trong Pa&s;s upon the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and in the late Civil Wars, it was e&s;teemed &s;o by both Parties. It was given by King <HI>Stephen</HI> to <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> as an Augmentation to his E&s;tate, and taken away by King <HI>Henry</HI> II. However, the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Kings always claimed it.</P>
<P>It is a Mayor-town, and had antiently Fifteen Churches; of later Days, but Four, and in the Civil Wars they were reduced to Two. The Cau&s;e of its Decay at fir&s;t, is &s;aid to be owing to a Court Minion, who procur'd the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> to be &s;topped, which had been navigable to the Town. The &s;aid River is now made navigable for &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els to <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>The Witches of <HI>Warbois,</HI> in this County, have made &s;o much Noi&s;e, that I &s;hall ju&s;t mention the fatal End of a Man, his Wife and Daughter, who were all Three hanged for torturing the Children of a Gentleman in the Pari&s;h: the Hi&s;tory of it is kept in <HI>Queen's</HI> College Library in <HI>Cambridge</HI>; and one of their Fellows preaches yearly, at <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> on that Occa&s;ion. The Children being &s;ick, their Urine was &s;ent to Ma&s;ter Dr. <HI>Dorrington</HI> at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> who &s;ent a Medicine again&s;t Worms. That prevailing nothing, the Doctor, upon &s;econd Thoughts, pronounced the Symptoms were from Witchcraft. It was not long before a proper Family was &s;u&s;pected: the Woman and her Daughter were frequently &s;ent for, and kept with the Children, and the Di&s;ea&s;e remitted upon the Sight of them; but chiefly upon a Confe&s;&s;ion, and a &s;ort of Petition added to it. To this Effect was the Girl's: <HI>As I am a Witch, and a greater Witch than my Mother, &s;o I de&s;ire, that the Pains &s;hall go off from this Child.</HI> The&s;e Confe&s;&s;ions were the chief Point again&s;t the Pri&s;oners, which they had been prevailed upon to re|peat by the Stranders-by, who had ob&s;erved the Children relieved upon it, as they imagined. And
<PB N="44" REF="45">
thus Three unhappy Per&s;ons were &s;acrificed to Igno|rance and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take farther Notice of this Subject when I come to <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> a County formerly famous for Witches, and where Per&s;ons likewi&s;e &s;uffered for this pretended Crime.</P>
<P>Here are the mo&s;t beautiful Meadows on the Banks of the River <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> that I think are to be &s;een in any Part of <HI>England</HI>; which, in the Summer Sea&s;on, are covered with &s;uch numerous Herds of Cattle, and Flocks of Sheep, as are hardly credible.</P>
<P>This Town is one long continued Street, pretty well built, e&s;pecially from the Ground Plot, where the Ca&s;tle &s;tood. Here was born <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> of genteel and worthy Parents. The Hou&s;e is new|built, but the Room in which he was born is pre|&s;erved in its fir&s;t State. It has a good Market-place; but the Free-&s;tone Bridge, or Bridges rather, and Cau&s;way over the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> are a very great Ornament as well as Benefit to the Place. Here is a good Publick School.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Godmanche&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Gormanche&s;ter,</HI> (a <HI>Ro|man</HI> Camp) and <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> is a wooden Bridge erected over a Rivulet, upon Principles of Gratitude and publick Charity, with this In&s;cription:
<Q>ROBERTUS COOK <HI>emergens aquis hoc viatoribus</HI><LB><HI>Sacrum D.D.</HI> 1636.</Q> That is:

<P>On the We&s;t Side of this Town, and in View of the plain lower Side of the County, is a noble, tho' antient Seat of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI>; the Gardens very fine and well kept; the Situation &s;eems a little ob&s;cured by the Town of <HI>Huntingdon.</HI> In the &s;ame

<P><HI>Erith</HI> is a large Town, but without a Market.</P>
<P><HI>St. Ives</HI> is a pretty neat Market-town, but is le&s;&s;en'd, and &s;uffer'd greatly by Fire. Here <HI>Crom|well,</HI> after he had prodigally wa&s;ted his paternal E&s;tate, rented a Farm, before he was elected Burge&s;s for <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hinchinbroke-hou&s;e,</HI> which gives Title of a Vi&s;|count to the elde&s;t Son of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and the Village of the &s;ame Name, lie at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from <HI>Huntingdon.</HI> And a little Way South-we&s;t &s;tands the Town of <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and that mo&s;t nobly &s;ituated and plea&s;ant Seat of the Duke of <HI>Man|che&s;ter, Kimbolton</HI> Ca&s;tle, where no Pains or Co&s;t has been &s;pared tu improve the mo&s;t beautiful Situ|ation in Nature with the Works and Ornaments of Art.</P>
<P><HI>Kimbolton</HI> Town is the <HI>Kiniubantum</HI> of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Here Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> after &s;he was divorced, re&s;ided for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ailwe&s;ton,</HI> in this County, are two Springs, one of fre&s;h Water, good for dim Eyes; the other bracki&s;h, of U&s;e for curing of Scabs, Lepro&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Huntingdon</HI> we came to <HI>St. Neots</HI> on the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> over which is a good Stone Bridge. The Church is &s;trong and well built, and the Steeple manife&s;ts the Skill of the Arti&s;t, much to his Ad|vantage. The Town takes its Name from <HI>Neotus,</HI> a learned and pious Man, who was interred here; from whom likewi&s;e <HI>St. Neots,</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> takes its Name, where he for &s;ome time re&s;ided. Hither
<PB N="46" REF="47">
Coals are brought by Water, and convey'd by Land around the Country.</P>
<P>Here we enter'd <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and came to <HI>Bed|ford,</HI> the chief Town; for it has no City in it, tho' this Town is larger and more populous than &s;everal Cities in <HI>England.</HI> It is one of the Seven Counties, which, they &s;ay, lie together, and have not one City among them; namely, <HI>Huntingdon, Bedford, Bucks, Berks, Hertford, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that tho' a great Part of this County, <HI>viz.</HI> the two whole Hundreds of <HI>Stodden</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> lie on the North of the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI>; yet there is but one Market-town in all that Side of the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> be&s;ide <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o remarkable, that tho' the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> by a long and winding Cour&s;e, cuts thro' the County, &s;o as to make above 70 Miles between <HI>Oulney</HI> and <HI>St. Neots,</HI> not above 20 by Land, yet in all that Cour&s;e it re|ceives only the little River <HI>Ivel,</HI> which falls into it a little above <HI>Temsford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bedford</HI> is a large, populous, thriving, plea&s;ant, and well-built Mayor-town; it has five Pari&s;h Churches, a very fine Stone Bridge over the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and the High Street (e&s;pecially) is very hand&s;ome and well-built: here is al&s;o a fair Market-place; but it is much improved lately in new Buildings. The River hath al&s;o been made navigable, and runs thro' the Town. It had formerly a Ca&s;tle, and now, where it &s;tood, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful Bowling-greens in the Kingdom. It has Two Ho&s;pitals for Lazars, and another for Eight poor People. Here is a Free-&s;chool well endow'd, and a Charity-&s;chool for Forty Children, and tho' the Town is not upon any of the great Roads in <HI>England,</HI> yet it is full of very good Inns, which afford elegant Entertainment; for here is the be&s;t Market for all Sorts of Provi&s;ions, that is to be &s;een at any Country Town in all the&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="48">
Parts of <HI>England</HI>; and the Rea&s;on of it is, that, tho' it is &s;o far from <HI>London,</HI> yet the Higglers or Carriers buy great Quantities of Provi&s;ions here for the <HI>London</HI> Markets; here al&s;o is a very good Trade down the River to <HI>Lynn.</HI></P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e is a great Corn-market, and va&s;t Quantities of Grain are bought here, and carried down by large Ve&s;&s;els and Barges to <HI>Lynn,</HI> where it is again &s;hipped, and carried by Sea to <HI>Holland.</HI> The Soil hereabouts is exceeding rich and fertile, and par|ticularly produces great Quantities of the be&s;t Wheat in <HI>England,</HI> which is carried by Waggons from hence, and from the North Part of the Country 20 Miles beyond this, to the Markets of <HI>Hitchin</HI> and <HI>Hertford,</HI> and bought again there, and ground and carried in the Meal (&s;till by Land) to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the whole Product of this County may be &s;aid to be Wheat and Malt for <HI>London</HI>; for here are very few Manufactures, except tho&s;e of Straw Hats and Bone Lace; of which by it&s;elf. There are but Ten Market-towns in the whole County, which I &s;hall recount as I took them in my Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Potton,</HI> which lies on the Borders of <HI>Cambridge|&s;hire,</HI> and of no Note. Southward &s;tands</P>
<P><HI>Biggle&s;wade,</HI> a plea&s;ant &s;ituated Place on the <HI>Ivel,</HI> and furni&s;hed with a great Number of good Inns for accommodating Travellers between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>York.</HI> Still more Southward lies</P>
<P><HI>Shefford,</HI> between two Rivulets; over each of which is a Bridge.</P>
<P>We&s;t of this Town &s;tands <HI>Ampthill,</HI> a pretty Town, delightfully &s;eated between two Hills. Near it is a large Park, with a great Man&s;ion-hou&s;e in it, which King <HI>Charles</HI> II. gave to the Noble Family of <HI>Bruce,</HI> who had their Title of Vi&s;count from this Town; notwith&s;tanding which, and that they were always Hereditary Stewards of the <HI>Manor</HI> of <HI>Ampt|hill,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="49">
yet the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Bruce</HI> lately &s;old his whole E&s;tate here to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> after &s;he was divorced, cho&s;e this Town as one of her Retiring-places. Farther Southward is</P>
<P><HI>Woburn,</HI> noted for having Plenty of Fullers Earth near it; and likewi&s;e another Kind of Earth, which petrifies Wood into Stone. This Town, having been almo&s;t demoli&s;hed by a terrible Fire, which happened a few Years ago, is now rebuilt, and makes no mean Appearance. It belongs almo&s;t all of it to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> who fini&s;hed, in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1737, a fine and commodious Market-place here.</P>
<P>The Duke's Hou&s;e, called <HI>Woburn Abbey,</HI> is ju&s;t by the Town, a good old Hou&s;e, and exceedingly plea&s;ant by its Situation, which is in a fine large Park walled round. The Duke had once de&s;igned to have pulled down the old Hou&s;e, and to rebuild it in a magnificent manner: but laid a&s;ide that Re&s;o|lution, and only repaired it. There are many noble Rooms in it, and particularly a very capacious and long Gallery, furni&s;hed with a great Variety of fine Pictures, chiefly of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> Family: the Wain|&s;coting of this noble Apartment is &s;trewed, as one may &s;ay, with gilded Stars, which have a pretty Effect among the Pictures. A Room has been laid into this Gallery at one End, where a good Billiard-table is placed.</P>
<P>Before the Hou&s;e is a very large Ba&s;on of Water, &s;urrounded with a fine broad Gravel-walk, which is bounded with Po&s;ts and Iron Chains. On the Water is a mo&s;t beautiful Yacht of between 30 and 40 Tons Burden, elegantly carved and gilt, and completely rigged, and mounts Ten Guns, which are fired on Occa&s;ion of Entertainments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> given on Board her by his Grace. There is al&s;o an elegant Boat with a fine Awning over it, a Wherry of the com|mon Shape, and a Skiff, which are very neat, and
<PB N="49" REF="50">
make a beautiful Appearance on this noble Ba&s;on of Water.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Woburn</HI> is <HI>Battle&s;den,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Thomas Page,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> abounding with many Beauties, and &s;till daily improving by additional Works in a very fine Ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Dun&s;table</HI> is &s;eated on a Hill, in a chalky Ground, in the County of <HI>Bedford.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of Four prin|cipal Streets, an&s;wering to the Four Quarters of the World. It is well inhabited, and furni&s;hed with many good Inns for the Accommodation of Travel|lers. In the Centre &s;tood one of Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI>'s beautiful Cro&s;&s;es, which was demoli&s;hed by the Par|liament Soldiers. The Situation of this Place being high, and no running Water near, they are forced to draw it up from deep Wells by means of great Wheels; and they have Four large Ponds to receive the Rain-water, which, as a Mark of the holding Quality of the Soil, are never dry, tho' they have no other Supply. They have &s;ometimes dug 24 Fathoms deep, in Search of Springs, to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>King&s;bury,</HI> once a Royal Seat, over-again&s;t the Church, is now a Farm-hou&s;e. The Church is compo&s;ed of many Pieces tacked together, as it were, &s;ome of which are very old. It was Part of the Priory, and Archbi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI> was the la&s;t Prior, who here pronounced the Sentence of Divorce again&s;t Queen <HI>Catharine.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentlemen of <HI>Bedford</HI> lately came to a laud|able Re&s;olution of levelling the Chalk-hill near this Town, for the Benefit of the Road, which in a Fro&s;t, or after a Snower of Rain, u&s;ed to be &s;o &s;lippery that neither Man nor Hor&s;e could keep their Feet, which occa&s;ioned often great Damage to both; to prevent which for the future, they imploy'd a Number of Hands to lower it.</P>
<P><HI>Dun&s;table</HI> &s;tands on the <HI>Roman Watling-&s;treet,</HI> ju&s;t where it is cro&s;&s;ed by <HI>Icknild-&s;treet.</HI> Here have

been <HI>Roman</HI> Coins frequently found; and on the De|&s;cent of <HI>Chiltern</HI> Hills, not far from the Town, is a large round Area of Nine Acres, &s;urrounded with a deep Ditch and Rampire called <HI>Mardin-hour.</HI> It was burnt by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and rebuilt by <HI>Henry</HI> I. to repre&s;s a va&s;t Number of Robbers which infe&s;ted the Country thereabouts; and it takes its Name from <HI>Dunning,</HI> one of the Thieves, and from <HI>Dun|ningce&s;taple</HI> it is now, by Contraction, called <HI>Dun|&s;table.</HI></P>
<P>On the Borders of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> &s;tands <HI>Leigh|ton,</HI> famous for a great Cattle and Hor&s;e-fair.</P>
<P>North-ea&s;t of <HI>Dun&s;table,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Hert|ford&s;hire,</HI> lies <HI>Luton,</HI> a little pretty Town, &s;eated very plea&s;antly among&s;t Hills, and noted for a good Market and Market-place.</P>
<P>This County is remarkable for having more Noblemens and Gentlemens Seats in it than any County in <HI>England.</HI> The Middle Part of the County is well &s;tored with Wood, which affords a great deal of Game.</P>
<P>Thro' the whole South Part of this County, as far as the Borders of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Hertford|&s;hire,</HI> the People are taken up with the Manufacture of Bone-lace, in which they are wonderfully in|crea&s;ed and improved.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Manufactures of Straw-work, e&s;pecially Straw Hats, &s;preads it&s;elf from <HI>Hertford&s;hire</HI> into this County, and is greatly increa&s;ed within a few Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus viewed this County in all its mo&s;t con&s;iderable Towns, we came from <HI>Dun&s;table</HI> to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> where we &s;aw the hand&s;ome Alms|hou&s;es built and endow'd by the <HI>Marlborough</HI> Fami|ly, and &s;o returned to <HI>London.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. CONTAINING A De&s;cription of Part of <HI>Nottingham|&s;hire,</HI> of <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> and Part of York&s;hire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING fini&s;hed the Account of my &s;everal Circuits, which complete the Southern Part of <HI>Britain</HI>; I am now to begin this Circuit from the River <HI>Trent,</HI> and to confine my Ob&s;erva|tions to the Country, which is called by &s;ome <HI>North by Trent.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Trent</HI> is deemed by antient Writers as the fourth capital River in <HI>England,</HI> the other three being the <HI>Thames,</HI> the <HI>Severn,</HI> and the <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Trent</HI> is not the large&s;t, yet it may be &s;aid to run the longe&s;t Cour&s;e, and ri&s;es nearer to the We&s;t Side of the I&s;land than any of the others; it is al&s;o the large&s;t, and of the longe&s;t Cour&s;e of any River in <HI>England,</HI> which does not empty its Waters immediately into the Sea; for the <HI>Trent</HI> runs into the <HI>Humber,</HI> and &s;o lo&s;es its Name before it reaches the Ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">It ri&s;es in the Highlands of <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> called the <HI>Moorlands,</HI> receiving from the Edge of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and towards <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> a great many (&s;ome &s;ay 30, and that thence it had its Name, for <HI>Trent</HI> in <HI>French</HI> is 30) little Rivulets into it, very near its Head; &s;o that it &s;oon becomes one large River, and comes down from the Hills with a violent Current into the flat Country; where, being increa&s;ed by &s;everal other little Rivers, it carries a deeper Chanel, and a &s;tiller Current; and having given its Name to <HI>Trentham,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town in the &s;ame County, it goes on to <HI>Stone,</HI> a con&s;iderable Town on the great Road to <HI>We&s;t Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>One Branch of the <HI>Trent</HI> ri&s;es within a Quarter of a Mile of the <HI>Dane,</HI> from a Moor adjoining to a little Ridge of Hills, called <HI>Molecop Hill,</HI> near <HI>Congleton,</HI> within 22 Miles of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea. As the <HI>Dane</HI> runs into the <HI>Weaver,</HI> and both into that Arm of the Sea, which the <HI>Mer&s;ee</HI> makes from <HI>Frod&s;ham</HI> to <HI>Liverpool</HI> and <HI>Hyle-lake</HI>; and as the <HI>Trent</HI> runs into the <HI>Humber,</HI> which opens into the great <HI>Ger|man</HI> Ocean; the&s;e Rivers may be &s;aid to cut the I&s;land acro&s;s in the middle.</P>
<P>It is true, the Northern Part is much larger than the Southern, now <HI>Scotland</HI> is united; otherwi&s;e the Country South by <HI>Trent,</HI> including <HI>Wales,</HI> is by far the large&s;t, as well as the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous, occa&s;ioned chiefly by the Commerce of the City of <HI>London.</HI> As for the Towns of <HI>Bri&s;tol, Exeter, Lynn, Norwich, Yarmouth, &amp;c.</HI> which are large and very populous, and carry on a prodigious Trade, as well in Merchandize as Manufacture, we &s;hall find them pretty near equalled by the Towns of <HI>Liverpool, Hull, Leeds, Newca&s;tle,</HI> and <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and the Cities of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Trent</HI> runs a Cour&s;e of near 200 Miles, thro' the four Counties of <HI>Stafford, Derby, Not|tingham,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln.</HI> It receives, be&s;ides le&s;&s;er
<PB N="53" REF="54">
Waters, the larger Rivers of the <HI>Sowe</HI> from the We&s;t Side of the County, and from the Town of <HI>Stafford</HI>; the <HI>Tame</HI> from <HI>Birmingham</HI> and <HI>Tamworth,</HI> the <HI>Soar</HI> from <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Dove</HI> and <HI>Derwent,</HI> two furiou&s;ly rapid Streams, from the <HI>Peak</HI> of <HI>Der|by</HI>; the <HI>Idle,</HI> a gentle navigable Stream, from <HI>Rhet|ford</HI> and <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> with part of the <HI>Witham,</HI> called the <HI>Fo&s;s-dike,</HI> from <HI>Lincoln,</HI> al&s;o navigable; and the greate&s;t of them all, the <HI>Dun,</HI> from <HI>Donca&s;ter, Rotheram,</HI> and <HI>Sheffield,</HI> after a long and rapid Cour&s;e thro' the Moors, called <HI>Stanecro&s;s,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Derby,</HI> and the We&s;t Riding of <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Trent</HI> is navigable by Ships of good Burden as high as <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> which is near 40 Miles from the <HI>Humber</HI> by the River. The Barges with|out the Help of Locks or Stops go as high as <HI>Not|tingham</HI>; and farther by the Help of Art, to <HI>Burton</HI> upon this River in <HI>Stafford&s;hire.</HI> The Stream is full, the Chanel deep and &s;afe, and the Tide flows up to <HI>Gainsborough</HI> and <HI>Newark.</HI> The Navigation, by the&s;e Advantages, is a great Support to the Trade of tho&s;e Counties which border upon it, e&s;pecially the Chee&s;e Trade from <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> which have otherwi&s;e no Navigation but from the&s;e Parts about <HI>We&s;t Che&s;ter</HI> to <HI>London</HI>; whereas by this River it is brought by Water to <HI>Hull,</HI> and from thence to all the South and North Coa&s;ts on the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The only Towns of Note &s;tanding upon the North Shore of <HI>Trent,</HI> are <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Burton,</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak in their Order.</P>
<P>The Counties North of <HI>Trent</HI> are <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> which may not improperly be called three Counties, as it is divided into three Ridings, each equal to &s;ome large Counties; <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> which is very large; <HI>Derby|&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> which are more Southerly. I &s;hall begin with the&s;e two, and take them to|gether.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">Beginning at the Mouth of <HI>Trent,</HI> the fir&s;t Town of Note that I met with is <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Capital of that Shire, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all that Part of <HI>England.</HI> The County is &s;mall, but, like the <HI>Peak,</HI> full of Wonders. (1.) 'Tis remarkable for its Situation, being bounded intirely by four Counties, and tho&s;e towards the four Cardinal Points, a Circum&s;tance peculiar to this County only. (2) For its Soil, which on the South Part is the riche&s;t and mo&s;t fruitful, and in the North Part the mo&s;t wild and wa&s;te, even almo&s;t to Barrenne&s;s, of any Part of <HI>England</HI> within many Miles of it. (3.) For the fine Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Dukes of <HI>Norfolk, King&s;ton, Rutland, New|ca&s;tle,</HI> Lord <HI>Middleton,</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>
<P><HI>Nottingham</HI> is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and beau|tiful Towns in <HI>England,</HI> from its Situation, were its Buildings not to be named.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated on the &s;teep A&s;cent of a Hill or Rock, overlooking a fine Range of Meadows of great Extent; a little Rivulet running on the North Side of them, almo&s;t clo&s;e to the Town: and the noble River <HI>Trent,</HI> parallel with both, on the South Side of the Meadows. Over the <HI>Trent</HI> is a &s;tately Stone Bridge of 19 Arches, where the River is very large and deep, having received the Addition of the <HI>Dove,</HI> the <HI>Derwent,</HI> the <HI>Irwa&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Soar,</HI> three of them very great Rivers of them&s;elves, which fall into it, after its pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Burton</HI> in <HI>Stafford|&s;hire</HI> mentioned before.</P>
<P>The Rock whereon the Town &s;tands is of a &s;andy kind, and &s;o &s;oft, that it is hewed into Vaults and Cellars, and yet &s;o firm, as to &s;upport the Roofs of the&s;e Cellars, two or three under one another. The Stairs which lead to the&s;e Vaults are cut out of the Rock, two or three Stories deep, to 80 Steps &s;ome|times: And the&s;e Cellars are well &s;tock'd with ex|cellent Ale, of which the Inhabitants are very liberal
<PB N="55" REF="56">
among their Acquaintance, as &s;ome in our Company experienc'd.</P>
<P>The Hill or Rock was called of old the <HI>Dolorous Hill,</HI> or <HI>Golgotha,</HI> becau&s;e of a great Slaughter of the antient <HI>Britons</HI> there by King <HI>Humber,</HI> a pira|tical Northern Monarch; who, being afterwards drowned between <HI>Hull</HI> and <HI>Barton,</HI> gave Name, as 'tis &s;aid, to that Arm of the Sea which is now called the <HI>Humber,</HI> and receives the <HI>Trent,</HI> and almo&s;t all the great Rivers of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> into it; tho' others derive the Name from the dreadful Noi&s;e of its Waves.</P>
<P>They tell us, that the&s;e Caves and Cellars &s;erved the People for a Retreat from their Enemies, and that from thence the Town fir&s;t took its Name, which was <HI>Snottengaham,</HI> &s;ignifying hollow Vaults in a Rock, <HI>Speluncarum Domus</HI>; and, as Mr. <HI>Cam|den</HI> ob&s;erves, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word was <HI>Tui ogo bauc,</HI> which &s;ignifies the &s;ame as the <HI>Latin,</HI> a Hou&s;e of Dens, or &s;ecret Caves to hide in.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the delightful Situation of <HI>Nottingham</HI> to|wards the River, it is equally plea&s;ant to the Land Side, towards the Fore&s;t on the North of the Town; where is a fine Plain for a Hor&s;e-cour&s;e, where Races u&s;ed to be run once a Year.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t End of the Town is a very &s;teep Hill, and at the South Side of it a Cliff, which falls in a Precipice down to the River. On this Hill &s;tood a Ca&s;tle of &s;o great Antiquity, that the Time of its fir&s;t Erection could never be traced. The fir&s;t Account we read of it, is, that there was a Tower here which the <HI>Danes</HI> ob&s;tinately defended again&s;t King <HI>Alfred,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Aethelred.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame Situation <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, or, as others, with greater Probability, maintain, <HI>Wil|liam Peverell,</HI> his natural Son, built another Ca&s;tle; which was afterwards repaired, or rather rebuilt, by <HI>Edward</HI> IV. who added fine Apartments to it,
<PB N="56" REF="57">
which <HI>Richard</HI> III. his Brother, &s;till farther inlarg'd; whereby it became in time very con&s;iderable, and &s;o &s;trong, that nothing could reduce it but Famine. 'Tis certain it has not undergone the ordinary Fate of other fortified Places, to be often taken and re|taken; for it was never &s;torm'd. Once indeed it was taken by Surprize in the Barons Wars by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl <HI>Ferrers,</HI> who al&s;o plundered the Town, or City, as it was then called.</P>
<P>The People here tell us of one of the <HI>Davids,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being kept Pri&s;oner in it; and that <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> Earl of <HI>March,</HI> was hid in a Vault under Ground, which they call <HI>Mortimer's-hole,</HI> whence he was taken, and hang'd for Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>This Report has &s;ome Foundation in Hi&s;tory, but is &s;o ob&s;cured by vulgar Tradition, that it led Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> fir&s;t into &s;ome Mi&s;takes in his Narration, and afterwards into a Disbelief of it. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> with the Queen, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and others, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Ca&s;tle, could have no Rea&s;on to hide him&s;elf under Ground: but it was by this pri|vate Pa&s;&s;age, which goes by Steps thro' the Rock up to the <HI>Keep,</HI> that Sir <HI>William Montacute,</HI> with others, 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. found means, in the Dead of the Night, to &s;eize him; and, &s;ending him up to the Tower, he was there beheaded.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was granted by K. <HI>James</HI> I. to <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI>; and K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. made it remark|able, by erecting there his Royal Standard, 1642; but he &s;oon quitted it, and the Parliament kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till the End of the War, when it was ordered to be demoli&s;hed. Some Parts of it however were &s;tand|ing at the Re&s;toration, when <HI>George Villiers,</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who&s;e Mother was the &s;ole Heir of the fore&s;aid Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> &s;old it to <HI>William Cavendi&s;h,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> He, in 1674, cleared the Foundations of the old Tower, a &s;mall Part excepted, and founded the noble Structure which is now &s;tand|ing;
<PB N="57" REF="58">
and devolved to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Pelham.</HI> The pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> beautified it, and wain|&s;coted the Rooms with Cedar, and had laid out a Plan for the fine&s;t Gardens in all that Part of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> being to contain no le&s;s than 60 Acres; but the De&s;ign is changed, and the intended Gardens are made a Park.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle, built on a high perpendicular Rock, as I have hinted, &s;eems to have been modell'd after &s;ome of the Draughts of <HI>Inigo Jones.</HI> There are many good Pictures in it; and it commands a va&s;t Pro&s;pect. The South Side of the Rock is altogether inacce&s;&s;ible, and va&s;t &s;ubterraneous Grottoes are cut underneath; and a winding Stair-ca&s;e quite to the Bottom ends in <HI>Mortimer's-hole,</HI> above-mention'd.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;tle at pre&s;ent is much neglected, being &s;tripp'd of its be&s;t Furniture and Hangings, and the Floors of &s;ome of the noble&s;t Apartments &s;uffer'd to fall in.</P>
<P><HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Church is a fine light&s;ome <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, with a good Ring of 8 Bells; but the great Tower makes a mean Appearance. The Butchers Shambles is an old Edifice built for a Granary.</P>
<P>They &s;hew'd us the Gardens of Count <HI>Tallard,</HI> who, in his Confinement here, after having been taken Pri&s;oner by the renowned Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> at the glorious Battle of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> amu&s;ed him&s;elf with making a &s;mall, but beautiful Parterre, after the <HI>French</HI> Ta&s;te, which happens not to be the reign|ing one with us at pre&s;ent. 'Tis &s;aid likewi&s;e, that this gallant Gentleman left behind him here &s;ome <HI>living</HI> Memorandums of his great Affection and E&s;teem for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ladies.</P>
<P>A hand&s;ome Town-hou&s;e upon Piazzas has been erected within the&s;e few Years, for the tran&s;acting of the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Corporation. Not many Years ago, the Hall where the A&s;&s;izes were held
<PB N="58" REF="59">
gave &s;uch a Crack, that the People were exceed|ingly frighted, and all ran out of it, leaving Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Powis</HI> upon the Bench, calling out after them, <HI>Is there nobody will take care of the Judge?</HI> for he was &s;o aged and infirm that he could hardly walk. But, finding him&s;elf neglected, he made &s;hift to de&s;cend from the Bench, and hobble out at the Door, where he denounc'd Vengeance again&s;t the Town, which, with a very &s;ea&s;onable Piece of Ju|&s;tice, he fin'd, for neglecting to keep the Hall in Repair.</P>
<P>The Town has been at great Expence in making the <HI>Trent</HI> navigable here for Ve&s;&s;els or Barges of Bur|den, by which all their heavy and bulky Goods are brought from the <HI>Humber,</HI> and even from <HI>Hull</HI>; &s;uch as Iron, Block-tin, Salt, Hops, Grocery, Dy|ers Wares, Wine, Oil, Tar, Hemp, Flax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;els bring down Lead, Coal, Wood, and Corn; as al&s;o Chee&s;e in great Quantities from <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> as I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>When I &s;aid the Bridge over <HI>Trent</HI> had nineteen Arches, I might have &s;aid al&s;o it was a Mile long; for the <HI>Trent,</HI> the la&s;t Time I was there, being &s;welled over its ordinary Bounds, reached quite up to the Town: yet a high Cau&s;eway, with Arches at proper Di&s;tances, carried us dry over the whole Breadth of the Meadows, which, I think, is at lea&s;t a Mile, and may ju&s;tly be called a Bridge, as that at <HI>Swar&s;ton,</HI> and al&s;o that of <HI>Poul Spooder</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> are called.</P>
<P>The chief Manufacture carried on here is Frame|work-knitting of Stockens, the &s;ame as at <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and &s;ome Gla&s;s, and earthen Ware. The latter is much increa&s;ed by the Con&s;umption of Tea-pots, Cups, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ince the Increa&s;e of Tea-drinking, as the Gla&s;s-hou&s;es, I think, are of late rather decreas'd. A Proof, one would think, that the Luxury of the
<PB N="59" REF="60">
Males is le&s;s predominant than that of the Females; or, rather as &s;ome would &s;ay, that the Men are brought over by the Ladies to join with them in the Love of the Tea-table: and indeed the latter &s;eems pretty much the Ca&s;e; whether it be owing to Gal|lantry and Complai&s;ance, or to Effeminacy and In|dolence, let tho&s;e concerned in the Ob&s;ervation an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>As they brew very good Liquor here, &s;o they make the be&s;t Malt (and more of it) of any Town in this Part of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;end it by Land-car|riage to <HI>Derby,</HI> thro' all the <HI>Peak,</HI> as far as <HI>Man|che&s;ter,</HI> and to other Towns in <HI>Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire,</HI> and even into <HI>York&s;hire</HI> it&s;elf; for which Purpo&s;e all the Low Lands of this County, and e&s;pecially on the Banks of the <HI>Trent,</HI> are made to yield prodigious Crops of Barley.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Nottingham</HI> is in a Mayor, Recorder, &s;ix Aldermen, two Coroners, two She|riffs, two Chamberlains, and 24 Common-council, whereof &s;ix are called Juniors. Here they hold a Court of Pleas. They have two Sergeants at Mace, and another Officer, which they call a Bill-bearer, and two more called Pindars, one for the Fields, and the other for the Meadows. The fir&s;t is al&s;o the Town Woodward, and attends the Fore&s;t Courts; for this Town is within the Juri&s;diction of the Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>I might enter into a long De&s;cription of all the modern Buildings erected lately at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> but that would be too great a Ta&s;k; only I mu&s;t take Notice of the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Plumtre,</HI> which is ju&s;tly to be admired for its elegant Front; and ob&s;erve in general, that as the Ca&s;tle has oftener been the Re&s;i|dence of Kings and Queens, than any other Place &s;o far di&s;tant from <HI>London</HI>; &s;o the Town has more Gentlemens Hou&s;es, than any other of its Big|ne&s;s in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> One may ea&s;ily gue&s;s <HI>Not|tingham</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="61">
to have been an antient Town of the <HI>Britons.</HI> As &s;oon as they had proper Tools, they fell to work upon the Rocks, which every-where offer them&s;elves &s;o commodiou&s;ly to make Hou&s;es in; one In&s;tance of which, tho' perhaps not old enough to be form'd on theirs, is a Ledge of perpendicular Rock in the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Park, hewn into a Church, Hou&s;es, Chambers, Dove-hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Church is like tho&s;e in the Rocks of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> in the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> The Altar is natural Rock, and there has been Painting on the Wall, a Steeple, where, perhaps, was a Bell, and regular Pillars. The River here wind|ing about, makes a Fortification to it; for it comes to both Ends of the Cliff, leaving a Plain before the middle. The Way to it was by Gates cut out of the Rock, and with an <HI>oblique</HI> Entrance for more Safety.</P>
<P>Between this and the Ca&s;tle is an Hermitage of like Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Clifton,</HI> in this Neighbourhood, is a good Seat, with pretty Gardens, and a noble Pro&s;pect; and in the Church are many old Bra&s;&s;es of the <HI>Clifton</HI> Fa|mily.</P>
<P>Three Miles from <HI>Nottingham</HI> is <HI>Wallaton-hall,</HI> the Seat of my Lord <HI>Middleton,</HI> and the noble&s;t Building in this County, except <HI>Belvoir,</HI> which only exceeds it in Spaciou&s;ne&s;s, but not in Beauty.</P>
<P>The Park, inclo&s;ed within a Brick Wall, is much finer than the great Park adjoming to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> being much better planted with Tim|ber; whereas that at <HI>Nottingham</HI> was all cut down, and &s;eque&s;tred in the late Wars.</P>
<P>There is a pretty Summer-hou&s;e panelled and ceiled with Looking-gla&s;s, which produces a plea&s;ant Effect. Underneath is a Water-hou&s;e, with grote&s;que Work of Shells, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Hall at the fir&s;t Entrance into the Hou&s;e, is &s;o high, that a Man on Hor&s;e-back might exerci&s;e a Pike in it.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">The Fore&s;t of <HI>Shirwood</HI> is an Addition to <HI>Not|tingham</HI> for the Plea&s;ure it affords of Hunting. There are al&s;o &s;ome fine Parks and noble Hou&s;es in it, as <HI>Welbeck,</HI> the late Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s, now Lord <HI>Oxford</HI>'s; and <HI>Thoresby,</HI> the pre&s;ent noble Seat of the <HI>Pierrepoints,</HI> Dukes of <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> which lies at the farthe&s;t Edge of the Fore&s;t. But this Fore&s;t is now given up, in a manner, to Wa&s;te: even the Woods, which formerly made it famous for Thieves, are de&s;troyed, &s;o that <HI>Robin Hood</HI> would now hardly find Shelter for a Week; nor is there any Store of Deer now left, at lea&s;t not worth mentioning.</P>
<P>From this Fore&s;t, I went purpo&s;ely out of my in|tended Way, to take a View of the Collegiate Church of <HI>Southwell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Southwell</HI> is a Market-town in <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> its Church is both Parochial and Collegiate; which, I think, is the Ca&s;e of no other in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>Rippon</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> To it belong &s;ixteen Preben|daries or Canons, &s;ix Vicars Choral, an Organi&s;t, &s;ix Singing Men, &s;ix Chori&s;ters, be&s;ides &s;ix Boys who attend as Probationers, a Regi&s;ter to the Cha|pter, a Trea&s;urer, an Auditor, a Virger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Church is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be founded by <HI>Paulinus,</HI> the fir&s;t Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> about the Year 630. It was &s;urrendered to the King, 32d <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and was actually in the King's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, until by Act of Parliament, 35 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. it was refounded, and re&s;tored to its antient Privilege, and incorporated by the Name of <HI>The Chapter of the Col|legiate Church of the ble&s;&s;ed</HI> Mary, <HI>the Virgin of</HI> Southwell.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> confirmed its Privileges; as did afterwards, on a Tryal at Law, King <HI>James</HI> I.</P>
<P>The Chapter have a peculiar Juri&s;diction, and there are 28 Pari&s;hes &s;ubject to it, to mo&s;t of which they have the Right of Pre&s;entation; be&s;ides &s;ome others in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> This Juri&s;|diction is exerci&s;ed by a Commi&s;&s;ary, or Vicar
<PB N="62" REF="63">
General, cho&s;en by the Chapter out of their Body, who holds Vi&s;itations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> twice a Year. And be|&s;ides the&s;e, there are two Synods yearly, to which all the Clergy of the County of <HI>Nottingham</HI> pay their Attendance; and a certain Number of the Preben|daries, and others of the con&s;iderable Clergy, are ap|pointed Commi&s;&s;ioners by a Commi&s;&s;ion granted by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> to pre&s;ide at the Synods.</P>
<P>The Civil Government of the Juri&s;diction of <HI>South|well</HI> is di&s;tinct from the County at large. It is called the <HI>Soke</HI> of <HI>Southwell cum Scrooby,</HI> which is another Town in this County. There are about twenty Towns &s;ubject to this Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cu&s;tos Rotulorum,</HI> and the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, are nominated by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> and con&s;tituted by a Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> who hold their Se&s;&s;ion both at <HI>Southwell</HI> and <HI>Scrooby,</HI> and perform all other Ju&s;ti|ciary Acts di&s;tinct from the County.</P>
<P>The Church is a &s;trong plain <HI>Gothick</HI> Building; it has no painted Figures in the Gla&s;s Work, nor Images, nor &s;o much as a Niche capable of placing an Image in. And from hence it has been con|jectured, that it was probably built before Image-wor&s;hip was practi&s;ed among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the fifth of <HI>November</HI> 1711, about Ten a Clock at Night, the Top of the Ball on one of the South Spires of this Church was fired by Lightning; which, backed by a furious Wind, that drove it almo&s;t directly on the Body of the Church, in a few Hours burnt down the Spire and Roof, melted the Bells, and &s;pared nothing which was com|bu&s;tible, except the other Spire, till it came to the Choir, where, after it had con&s;umed the Organs, it was by &s;ingular Providence &s;topt and extingui&s;h'd. The Damage was computed at near Four thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>The Church is built in Form of a Cro&s;s; a great Tower in the Middle, in which are eight Bells, and
<PB N="63" REF="64">
two Spires at the We&s;t End. There is a hand&s;ome Chapter-hou&s;e on the North Side of the Choir.</P>
<P>The Length of the Church from Ea&s;t to We&s;t is 306 Feet, the Length of the cro&s;s I&s;le from North to South is 121 Feet; the Breadth of the Church is 59 Feet.</P>
<P>There are no very remarkable Monuments in this Church, except one of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sands,</HI> which is within the Communion Rails, and is a fair Tomb of Alaba&s;ter, with his Effigies lying on it at full Length, with a fine In&s;cription upon it in <HI>Latin,</HI> greatly to his Honour; but which being very long, I have not Room to in&s;ert.</P>
<P>Here was formerly a Palace belonging to the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> which &s;tood on the South Side of the Church, the Ruins of which &s;till remain; by which it appears to have been a large and &s;tately Building. It was demoli&s;hed in the Time of the late Civil Wars. The Church e&s;caped the Fury of tho&s;e Times, by the good Offices of one <HI>Edward Cludd,</HI> E&s;quire, one of the Parliament Side, who lived at <HI>Norwood,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Southwell,</HI> in a Hou&s;e belonging to the Archbi&s;hop. Here were no le&s;s than three Parks belonging to the Archbi&s;hop, which, though di&s;parked, &s;till retain the Name; one of which is <HI>Norwood</HI> Park, in which is a good Hou&s;e, which, has been very much inlarged and beautified by Mr. <HI>Burton,</HI> a De&s;cendant of the above <HI>Edward Cludd,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who lives in it &s;ome Part of the Year.</P>
<P>There is a Free-&s;chool adjoining to the Church, under the Care of the Chapter, where the Choir|i&s;ters are taught <HI>gratis,</HI> and other Boys belonging to the Town. The Ma&s;ter is cho&s;en by the Cha|pter, and is to be approved by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>There are al&s;o two Fellow&s;hips and two Scholar|&s;hips in St. <HI>John</HI>'s College in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> founded by Dr. <HI>Keton,</HI> Canon of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> in the 22d Year of
<PB N="64" REF="65">
King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to be cho&s;en by the Ma&s;ter and Fellows of the &s;aid College out of &s;uch as have been Choiri&s;ters of the Church of <HI>Southwell.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Southwell</HI> I turned to the Left to <HI>New&s;ted,</HI> to vi&s;it the antient Seat of the very antient Family of the <HI>Byrons,</HI> who even in the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s Time were wealthy. It was a &s;mall Priory founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> II. and given by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII to Sir <HI>John Byron</HI>; one of which Name having &s;ignalized him&s;elf very remarkably for his Loyalty to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. was created a Baron, which Honour &s;till continues in the Family. Near this Place is the Head of the little River <HI>Lin.</HI></P>
<P>We came next to <HI>Ain&s;ley,</HI> which Town gave Name to a Family that were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it from the Conque&s;t to the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. from whence are de&s;cended the Earls of <HI>Angle&s;ey:</HI> but for want of Heirs Male, it came then by Marriage into the Family of the <HI>Chaworths,</HI> who have a good Seat here, well wooded, and watered with beauti|ful Fi&s;h-ponds.</P>
<P>We then turned again on the Right to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> which lies in the Fore&s;t, a large well-built Market-town, noted now for its Trade in Malt, and for have|ing been formerly the Place, to which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> u&s;ed to retire for the Plea&s;ure of Hunting in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Shirwood</HI>; in&s;omuch that a Manor was held in this County by <HI>Henry Fauconberg</HI> for Shoeing the King's Hor&s;e, whenever he came to <HI>Mansfield.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we kept &s;till to the Right North-ea&s;t, and came to <HI>Taxford in the Clays,</HI> an ordinary, dirty Market-town on the great Road to <HI>York,</HI> and of no other Note, than being &s;ituated in a miry, clayey Country, and call'd by King <HI>James</HI> I. <HI>Taxford in the T&mdash;d.</HI></P>
<P>We kept the Road North to <HI>Ea&s;t Retford,</HI> &s;o called as it lies on the Ea&s;t Side of the River <HI>Idle.</HI> It
<PB N="65" REF="66">
is an antient Bailiwick-town, and noted for an Ex|emption of all Tolls and foreign Services. It holds Pleas without Limitation of Sums, and enjoys many other valuable Privileges and Immunities. It has a Steward who is generally a Per&s;on of Quality.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;t Retford</HI> is &s;o call'd from its Situation in regard to the other, tho' they &s;eem to be but one Town, the <HI>Idle</HI> only dividing them. This is famous for a fine Ho&s;pital, founded by Dr. <HI>Dorrel</HI> in 1666, and &s;ince incorporated. It has a Ma&s;ter, 10 Brethren, a Steward, and a Nur&s;e; and they have a Garden and Orchard divided into 10 Shares.</P>
<P><HI>Chaworth</HI> is a Village ju&s;t by, noted for a fine Rectory of 200<HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>Higher up &s;tands <HI>Blith,</HI> which is a kind of Mar|ket-town, where are a very large good Church, and &s;ome old Ruins of a Ca&s;tle and a Priory.</P>
<P>We then fell down Southward, and vi&s;ited the noble Seats of the Duke of <HI>King&s;ton</HI> at <HI>Thore&s;by,</HI> of the Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> at <HI>Welbeck,</HI> and of the late Marquis of <HI>Halifax,</HI> but now of Sir <HI>George Savil,</HI> at <HI>Rufford,</HI> or <HI>Rugford</HI> Abbey, all very magnificent Structures though antient, e&s;pecially that at <HI>Welbeck,</HI> which is beautified with large Additions, fine Apartments, and good Gardens; but particularly the Park, which is well &s;tocked with large Timber of the fine&s;t Kind, and with great Numbers of Deer. For the late Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Delight (who&s;e Property it was, before it came by Marriage into the <HI>Harley</HI> Family) being chiefly on Hor&s;eback, and in the Chace, it is not to be wondered, if he rather made his Parks fine than his Gardens, and his Stables than his Man&s;ion-hou&s;e: yet the Hou&s;e is noble, large, and magnificent.</P>
<P>Hard by <HI>Welbeck,</HI> near the Head of the River <HI>Ryton,</HI> is <HI>Wirk&s;op Manor,</HI> the &s;ometime &s;tately Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Talbot,</HI> de&s;cended by a long Line of Ance&s;tors from another Family illu&s;trious,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
though not innobled, of <HI>Lovetofts</HI>; one of whom being Lord of this Place under the <HI>Normans,</HI> built a Priory here: and <HI>John,</HI> the &s;econd Earl of <HI>Shrew&s;|bury,</HI> being &s;lain at the Battle of <HI>Northampton,</HI> 38 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was buried in it; which afterwards, at the Di&s;&s;olution of Mona&s;teries, was &s;ettled on <HI>Francis,</HI> his Great Grand&s;on. This Hou&s;e (though in its an|tient Figure) is outdone by none of the be&s;t and greate&s;t in the County. It now belongs to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a good Market-town al&s;o, of the Name of <HI>Wirk&s;op,</HI> where are the Ruins of a Mona&s;tery to be &s;een in the Meadows on the Ea&s;t Side of it, and the We&s;t End of the Church, which is &s;till &s;tanding, and has Two beautiful and fair Towers. This Place is noted for Liquorice and Malt.</P>
<P>From hence leaving <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> the We&s;t Part of which abounds with Lead and Coal, we came to <HI>Bal&s;over</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> which &s;tands on a ri&s;ing Ground, and has a Ca&s;tle, and is the Property of the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> but is no Market-town.</P>
<P>From hence we intended to pa&s;s directly to <HI>Derby</HI>; but being informed, that the Moors, by rea&s;on of the Rocks and Bogs which render the Roads difficult and hazardous, were too dangerous to travel over, we left them on the We&s;t of us; and pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>Mansfield</HI> in <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Alfreton</HI> a &s;mall Market-town within the Skirts of <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> we arriv'd at <HI>Derby</HI> the County-town. But tho' we avoided the Moors, yet we had &s;ome Rea&s;on to com|plain of the Roads, which we took from the North of <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> where we were informed, that if we had come directly from <HI>Nottingham</HI> to this Town, and kept the Mid-way between the <HI>Trent</HI> on the Left, and the Mountains on the Right, we &s;hould have found the 12 Miles, which lie between them, as agreeable with re&s;pect to the Situation of the Coun|try,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
the Soil, and the well planting of it, as any of the &s;ame Length in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Derby</HI> is &s;ituate on the We&s;t Bank of the <HI>Derwent,</HI> over which it has a very fine Stone Bridge, well-built, but antient, and a Chapel upon the Bridge, now converted into a Dwelling-hou&s;e. It is a fine, beautiful, and plea&s;ant Town, and has more Families of Gentlemen in it, than is u&s;ual in Towns &s;o remote; perhaps the more, becau&s;e the <HI>Peak,</HI> which takes up the larger Part of the County, is &s;o inho&s;pitable, rugged, and wild a Place, that the Gentry chu&s;e to re&s;ide at <HI>Derby,</HI> rather than upon their E&s;tates, as they do el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Here is a Curio&s;ity of a very extraordinary Na|ture, and the only one of the Kind in <HI>England:</HI> I mean tho&s;e Mills on the <HI>Derwent,</HI> which work the three capital <HI>Italian</HI> Engines for making Organzine or Thrown Silk, which, before the&s;e Mills were erected, was purcha&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants with ready Money in <HI>Italy</HI>; by which Invention one Hand will twi&s;t as much Silk, as before could be done by Fifty, and that in a much truer and better Manner. This Engine contains 26,586 Wheels, and 97,746 Movements, which work 73,726 Yards of Silk-thread, every time the Water-wheel goes round, which is three times in one Minute, and 318,504,960 Yards in one Day and Night. One Water-wheel gives Motion to all the re&s;t of the Wheels and Movements, of which any one may be &s;topt &s;eparately. One Fire-engine, likewi&s;e, conveys warm Air to every individual Part of the Machine, and the whole Work is govern'd by one Regulator. The Hou&s;e which contains this Engine is of a va&s;t Bulk, and Five or Six Stories high.</P>
<P>A Patent pa&s;&s;ed 5 <HI>George</HI> I. to &s;ecure to Sir <HI>Thomas Lombe</HI> the &s;ole Property of this Invention for 14 Years; but the requi&s;ite Buildings and Engines, and the in&s;tructing of proper Per&s;ons to work them, took
<PB N="68" REF="69">
up &s;o much Time, and when all was completed, the King of <HI>Sardinia</HI> prohibiting the Importation of the Raw Silk made by the &s;aid Engines, into his Domi|nions, all which render'd the Undertaking expen|&s;ive and difficult, and the Term of 14 Years being near elap&s;ed, without any great Benefit accruing from the u&s;eful Invention, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> apply'd for a Con|&s;ideration from the Publick; and the Parliament ac|cordingly, to pre&s;erve &s;o u&s;eful an Undertaking for the Benefit of the Kingdom in general, allotted 14000<HI>l.</HI> to be paid to Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> on Condition that he &s;hould allow a perfect Model to be taken of his new-invented Engines, in order to &s;ecure and perpetuate the Art of making the &s;ame. The Preamble to this Act &s;ets forth, That Sir <HI>Thomas Lombe</HI> did with the utmo&s;t Difficulty and Hazard, and at a very great Expence, di&s;cover the Art of making and working the Three Capital Engines made u&s;e of by the <HI>Ita|lians</HI> to make their Organzine Silk, and did intro|duce tho&s;e Arts and Inventions into this King|dom.</P>
<P>This wonderful Piece of Machinery was under the Direction of Sir <HI>Thomas Lombe,</HI> or, as &s;ome &s;ay, of his Brother, erected by one <HI>Soracole,</HI> a Man ex|pert in making Mill-work, e&s;pecially for rai&s;ing Wa|ter to &s;upply Towns for Family U&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Derby,</HI> as I have &s;aid, is a Town of Gentry, ra|ther than Trade; yet it is populous, well-built, has Five Pari&s;hes, a large Market-place, a beautiful Town-hou&s;e of Free-&s;tone, and very hand&s;ome Streets. But the Entrance into it every Way is &s;o choaked up with Dirt and Mire, that it is no &s;mall Matter of Reproach to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the Church of <HI>All Saints</HI> is the Burial-place of the noble <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> Family; and an Ho&s;pital clo&s;e by the Church, built by one of that Family, for Eight poor Men, and Four Women.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">This Church is remarkable for the Architecture of its beautiful <HI>Gothick</HI> Tower, 178 Feet high; and for the Elegance of its Ornaments, as well as Height, is not to be equalled in this, or in any of the adjacent Counties.</P>
<P>According to an In&s;cription in this Church, the Steeple was erected about Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, at the Charge of the Maidens and Batchelors of the Town; on which Account, whenever a Maiden, a Native of the Town, was married, the Bells u&s;ed to be rung by Batchelors. How long the Cu&s;tom la&s;ted, I have not read; but I do not find it is now continued. This Union of the Maidens and Batchelors to build a Steeple, reminds me of a Bell ca&s;t by a like Contri|bution, upon which was this Device,
<Q><HI>Materiem Juvenes, Formam tribuere Puellae.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Government of this Town is in a Mayor, High Steward, 9 Aldermen, a Recorder, 14 Brothers, 14 Capital Burge&s;&s;es, and a Town Clerk. What Trade there is in the Town is chiefly in good Malt and good Ale.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Derby,</HI> along the <HI>Ricning Way,</HI> is <HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> where is a Bridge of 37 Arches. Here was an old Abbey, out of who&s;e Ruins they have within the&s;e few Years built a new Church.</P>
<P>A Mile below <HI>Derby,</HI> upon the <HI>Derwent,</HI> &s;tood the old <HI>Roman Derventio,</HI> now <HI>Little Che&s;ter.</HI> Remains of the old Walls, Vaults, Wells, <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, Aqueducts, Human Bones, Bra&s;s Rings, and other Marks of Antiquity, have been from time to time di&s;covered and dug up. The River being too rapid for a Ford, a Bridge was antiently there, the Foun|dations of which with a Staff they can &s;till feel.</P>
<P>A little further North, is <HI>Horre&s;ton</HI> Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Ruins on a hoary Rock, are &s;carce di&s;cernible.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">It is ob&s;ervable, that as the <HI>Trent</HI> bounds the County of <HI>Derby</HI> South, &s;o the <HI>Dove</HI> and the <HI>Erwa&s;h</HI> make the Bounds Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and the <HI>Derwent</HI> runs thro' the Centre, all of them beginning and ending their Cour&s;e in the &s;ame County; for they ri&s;e in the <HI>Peak,</HI> and end in the <HI>Trent.</HI> The <HI>Der|went</HI> is remarkable for its Brownne&s;s, the <HI>Dove</HI> for its blue Tran&s;parency, from whence it probably took its Name. It is endued with &s;uch a peculiar Fecun|dity, &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from a Bed of Lime, thro' which it pa&s;&s;es, that it has often been compared to the River <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>It is not le&s;s &s;wift in its Operations than effectual; for by ha&s;ty Rains, which fall from the Hills, it &s;ome|times &s;trays over the Meadows, and having impreg|nated them, in 12 Hours time retires into its Bed again.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e temporary Inundations I &s;aw it, when having gone from <HI>Derby</HI> to <HI>Dowbridge,</HI> as it is called, I pa&s;&s;ed it with Difficulty to &s;ee Two Market-towns, <HI>A&s;hbourn,</HI> and <HI>Utoxeter,</HI> the <HI>Utocetum</HI> of the Antients.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t lies on the Ea&s;t Side of the River in a very rich Soil to the North-we&s;t of <HI>Derby,</HI> and the other, commonly called <HI>Utce&s;ter,</HI> is &s;ituate due We&s;t of <HI>Derby,</HI> on the other Side of the River in <HI>Staf|ford&s;hire,</HI> upon a delicious ri&s;ing Ground of an ea&s;y A&s;cent, and very fruitful, overlooking a Track of fine, rich Meadow-grounds. The Town is very ordinarily built, but has a good and commodious Market-place, and an excellent Market for all &s;orts of living Kine, be&s;ides Butter, Chee&s;e, and Corn, and al&s;o all kinds of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>In our Way to the <HI>High Peak</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed an antient Seat, large, but not very gay, of Sir <HI>Nathanael Cur|&s;on.</HI> From hence we kept the <HI>Derwent</HI> on our Right-hand, which having overflowed its Banks, by the Acce&s;&s;ion of Floods pouring down from the <HI>Peak</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="72">
<HI>Hills,</HI> render'd it &s;o frightful, that we contented our|&s;elves with hearing at a Di&s;tance its &s;hocking Roar; and &s;o came to <HI>Quarn,</HI> or <HI>Quarnden,</HI> a little ragged, but noted Village, where is a famous Chalybeat Spring, to which abundance of People re&s;ort in the Sea&s;on to drink the Water; as likewi&s;e a Cold Bath. There are al&s;o &s;everal other Mineral Waters in this Part of the Country, a hot Bath at <HI>Matlock,</HI> and an|other at <HI>Buxton,</HI> of which in their Places. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are hot Springs in &s;everal Places which run wa&s;te into the Ditches and Brooks, and are taken no notice of, being remote among the Moun|tains, and out of the Way of common Re&s;ort.</P>
<P>We found the Wells at <HI>Quarn</HI> pretty full of Com|pany, the Waters good, and very phy&s;ical, but wretched Lodging and Entertainment.</P>
<P>From <HI>Quarnden</HI> we advanced due North, and mounting the Hills gradually for Four or Five Miles, we &s;oon had a mo&s;t di&s;mal View of the black Mountains of the <HI>Peak</HI>; however, as they were at a Di&s;tance, and a good Town lay on our Left, called <HI>Wirk&s;worth,</HI> we turned thither for Refre&s;hment. Here we found verify'd what I had often heard be|fore, that however dreary the Hills might appear, the Vales were every-where fruitful and delightful to the Eye, al&s;o well-inhabited, and having in them good Market-towns, abounding with all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions; and as for the Ale, the further we went Northward, the better it &s;eemed to be.</P>
<P><HI>Wirk&s;worth</HI> is a large well-frequented Market-town; tho' there is no very great Trade carry'd on in it, but what relates to the Lead-works.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peakrills,</HI> as they are called, are a rude boori&s;h kind of People; but bold, daring, and even de&s;pe|rate in their Search into the Bowels of the Earth: for which Rea&s;on they are often imployed by our Engineers in the Wars to carry on the <HI>Sap,</HI> when they lay Siege to &s;trong fortified Places.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">The <HI>Barmoot Court,</HI> kept at <HI>Wirk&s;worth,</HI> to judge Controver&s;ies among the Miners, and adju&s;t &s;ubter|ranean Quarrels and Di&s;putes, is very remarkable. It con&s;i&s;ts of a Ma&s;ter and 24 Jurors, who, when any Per&s;on has found a Vein of Ore in another's Land, (except it be in Orchards or Gardens) a&s;&s;ign two Meres of Ground in a <HI>Pipe</HI> (as they term it) and a <HI>Flat,</HI> the former being 29 Yards long, and the lat|ter 14 Yards Square, appointing to the Finder one Mere, and the other to the Owner of the Land, half at each End of the Finder's; and moreover, certain Fees and Perqui&s;ites for the Pa&s;&s;age of Carts, the U&s;e of Timber, and the like. This Court not only pre&s;cribes Rules to the Miners, and limits their Pro|ceedings in the Works under-ground, but is Judge of all their little Quarrels above.</P>
<P>The Produce of the Mines in this Hundred is very con&s;iderable: the King claims the 13th Peny Duty, for which they compound at the Rate of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a Year; nay, I have been informed, that the Tythe of <HI>Wirk&s;worth</HI> alone has been worth to the Incumbent yearly that Sum.</P>
<P>Not far from hence lies <HI>Hartington,</HI> which gives Title of Marquis to the elde&s;t Son of the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Wirk&s;worth,</HI> and upon the very Edge of <HI>Derwent,</HI> is a Village called <HI>Matlock,</HI> where, as I &s;aid, are &s;everal warm Springs. One of the&s;e is &s;e|cured by a Stone Wall on every Side, by which the Water is brought to ri&s;e to a due Height; and if it is too high, there is a Sluice to let it out as low as you plea&s;e. It has a Hou&s;e built over it, and room within the Building to walk round the Bath, and &s;o by Steps go down gradually into it. The Water is but ju&s;t Milk-warm, &s;o that it is no le&s;s plea&s;ant to go into, than &s;anative.</P>
<P>This Bath would be much more frequented than it is, if a &s;ad, &s;tony, mountainous Road, which leads
<PB N="73" REF="74">
to it, and no good Accommodation when you are there, did not hinder; for from the Bath you are to cro&s;s over the Meadows, and then a&s;cend a <HI>Derby|&s;hire</HI> Hill, before you meet with a Hou&s;e of Refre&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Miles before you come to <HI>Matlock,</HI> you pa&s;s over barren Moors in perpetual Danger of &s;lip|ping into Coal-pits and Lead-mines, or ride for Miles together on the Edge of a &s;teep Hill on &s;olid &s;lippery Rock, or loo&s;e Stones, with a Valley underneath, the Bottom of which you can hardly di&s;cover with your Eye. In&s;tead of Trees and Hedges, they fence|in their poor Meadow for Arable, with Walls made of loo&s;e Stones, pick'd from under their Feet. The extended Sides of the Mountains are generally pow|der'd over, as it were, with Rocks, Streams of Water dribbling down every where, and &s;ometimes bolder Cataracts diver&s;ify the romantick Scene.</P>
<P>At the Smelting-mills, they melt down the Lead Ore, and run it into a Mold, whence it becomes <HI>Pigs,</HI> as they call them. The Bellows are kept in continual Motion by running Water. We were complimented to be let down 200 Yards deep into the Mines, if we pleas'd. Over-again&s;t this warm Bath, and on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Derwent,</HI> we came to a mon&s;trous Parcel of gigantick Rocks, &s;eemingly pil'd on one another, called the <HI>Torr.</HI> A few Inhabitants in little Cottages tru&s;ted them&s;elves at Bottom, under &s;o ruinous a Shelter. I took the Pains on Hands and Knees to clamber near the Top, and enter'd an Hermit's Cell hewn in the Rock, with a mo&s;t dreary Pro&s;pect before it. On one End is a Crucifix and a little Nich, where I &s;uppo&s;e the An|chorite plac'd his Saint. Over-again&s;t it, about half a Mile off, is &s;uch another Cliff, but by the Care of a Gentleman who lives underneath, Mr. <HI>A&s;he,</HI> is hewn out of the Rock an ea&s;y A&s;cent by Steps, and there are abundance of Alcoves, Grotts, Summer-hou&s;es,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
Cellars, Pinacles, Dials, Balu&s;trades, Urns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all of the &s;ame Materials. And by the Help of Earth carry'd up to the Top, there are fine Gra&s;s Walks, with Greens planted along them upon this hanging Terrace; whence you have a fine View over many a craggy Mountain.</P>
<P>A little on the other Side of <HI>Wirk&s;worth</HI> begins a long Plain, called <HI>Bra&s;&s;ington Moor,</HI> which reaches from <HI>Bra&s;&s;ington</HI> to <HI>Buxton,</HI> full 12 Miles: from <HI>Wirk&s;worth</HI> it is not quite &s;o much. The <HI>Peak</HI> People, who are mighty fond of rai&s;ing the Admi|ration of Strangers, told us here of another high Mountain, where a Giant was buried, which they called the <HI>Giant's Tomb.</HI></P>
<P>We rode up the Hill, which &s;eem'd to be round, with a Precipice almo&s;t on every Side of it. While we were in que&s;t of the Tomb of the Dead, we found the Rock afforded an Habitation for a poor Woman and her Children. We entered into their Man&s;ion, divided by a Curtain into its &s;everal Offices, and a Funnel work'd thro' the Top to carry the Smoke out, where the celebrated Tomb&s;tone was. Her Hu&s;band, &s;he &s;aid, was a Miner, who, if he had good Luck, could earn his Five Pence, and &s;he could al&s;o earn her Three Pence a Day, were it not for the Care of &s;o many Children; but, &s;he ble&s;&s;ed God, they lived very comfortably. An In&s;tance of that happy Contentment oftener met with in Habitations like this, than in gilded Palaces!</P>
<P>We went next, by the Direction of the good Wo|man, to a Valley on the Side of a ri&s;ing Hill, where were &s;everal Grooves (for &s;o they call the Mouth of the Shaft, or Pit, by which they go down into a Lead Mine). As we were &s;tanding &s;till to look at one of them, admiring how &s;mall they were, and &s;carce be|lieving a poor Man, who told us they went down tho&s;e narrow Holes to a great Depth in the Earth, we were &s;urpri&s;ed with &s;eeing a Hand, and then an
<PB N="75" REF="76">
Arm, and quickly after a Head, thru&s;t up out of the very Groove we were looking at.</P>
<P>Immediately we rode clo&s;er up to the Place, where we &s;aw the poor Wretch working and heav|ing him&s;elf up gradually, as we thought, with Diffi|culty; but when he &s;hewed us that it was by &s;etting his Feet and Elbows upon Pieces of Wood fixt cro&s;s the Angles of the Groove like a Ladder, we found the Difficulty was not much, and that if the Groove had been larger, he could not go up and down with &s;o much Ea&s;e or Safety.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would have a more perfect Idea of tho&s;e Grooves, need only &s;ee the &s;quare Wells in the Church of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> by which the Workmen go down from the Top of the Church into the very Vaults under it, to place the Leaden Pipes, which carry the Rain Water from the Flat of the Roof to the Common-&s;ewer. They have &s;mall Iron Bars placed cro&s;s the Angles for the Men to &s;et their Feet on, in the manner here repre&s;ented. <FIGURE>

<P>When this &s;ubterranean Creature was come quite out, with all his Furniture about him, he afforded us new matter of Wonder, which &s;atisfy'd our Cu|rio&s;ity without venturing down our&s;elves. For the Man was a mo&s;t uncouth Spectacle; he was cloathed all in Leather, had a Cap of the &s;ame without Brims, &s;ome Tools in a little Ba&s;ket, which he drew up with him, not one of the Names of which we could under&s;tand, but by the Help of an Interpreter. Nor indeed could we under&s;tand any of the Man's Di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;o as to make out a whole Sentence, and yet he was pretty free of his Tongue too. He was lean as a Skeleton, pale as a dead Corps, his Hair and Beard a deep black; what little Fle&s;h he had, was lank, and, as we thought, &s;omething of the Colour of the Lead it&s;elf. Be&s;ides his Ba&s;ket of Tools, he brought up with him about three Quarters of a hun|dred
<PB N="76" REF="77">
Weight of Ore, which was no &s;mall Load, con|&s;idering the Manner of his coming up; and it was this which occa&s;ioned that Heaving and Struggling at his fir&s;t Appearance; and it &s;eems he was at work 60 Fathoms deep, but that there were five Men of his Party, two of whom were 11 Fathoms, and the other three 15 Fathoms deeper. The Man &s;eemed to regret, that he was not at work with the&s;e three; for they had a Way out at the Side of the Hill, without coming up &s;o high as he was obliged to do. We then looked on the Ore, and got the poor Man's Leave to bring every one a &s;mall Piece of it away with us, for which we gave him two Pieces of better Metal.</P>
<P>From hence entering upon <HI>Bra&s;&s;ington Moor,</HI> men|tioned above, we had eight Miles &s;mooth Green Riding to <HI>Buxton</HI> Bath, which they call <HI>One</HI> of the Seven Wonders of the <HI>Peak,</HI> compri&s;ed in that noted Ver&s;e of Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Aedes, Mons, Barathrum, binus Fons, Antraque bina.</HI></L></Q><Q><L>Hou&s;e, Mountain, Depth, two Fountains, and two Caves.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Place has &s;ome Advantages beyond what the City of <HI>Bath</HI> can pretend to. Here is an open and healthy Country, a Variety of fine Views to enter|tain the Curious, and a beautiful Down for the Ladies to take the Air in, much more agreeable than the clo&s;e City of <HI>Bath,</HI> which is very deficient in this Parti|cular.</P>
<P>And as to the Medicinal Nature of the Waters at <HI>Buxton,</HI> hear what Dr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;ays of their Virtues, and the Manner of their Operation, in his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory of</HI> Lanca&s;hire, <HI>and of the</HI> Peak. His Words are as follow: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="77" REF="78"><P>"The Waters are Sulphurous and Saline, yet not fetid, but very palatable, becau&s;e the Sulphur is not united with any Vitriolic Particles, or but very few Saline; it tinges not Silver, nor is it Purga|tive, becau&s;e its Saline Parts are di&s;pen&s;ed in &s;uch &s;mall Proportions.</P>
<P>"If drank, they create a good Appetite, open Ob&s;tructions, and no doubt, if mixed with the Chalybeat Waters that are there al&s;o, may an&s;wer all the Intentions of the <HI>Bath</HI> Water in <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> and that of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s too at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;o noted for curing the <HI>Diabetes,</HI> of which I have &s;een &s;everal In&s;tances in the&s;e Parts; and likewi&s;e for curing of Bloody Urines, of which I &s;aw a mo&s;t noted In&s;tance at <HI>Liverpool.</HI></P>
<P>"This Bath is of a temperate Heat, and, with|out que&s;tion, by a reverberating <HI>Halitus</HI> might be brought to any Degree of Heat; but, I think, in its own natural Heat, it may in general be &s;aid to be more agreeable to the Con&s;titution; and where the hot Baths cannot be &s;afely u&s;ed, this may. This la&s;t Summer I &s;aw remarkable In&s;tances of its Effects in &s;corbutick Rheumati&s;ms in Per&s;ons, that could not go before without the Help of Crutches, who came from thence to <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> on Foot without them, di&s;tant from <HI>Buxton</HI> full 16 Northern Miles."</P></Q></P>
<P>The Village where the principal Springs are, is called <HI>Buxton,</HI> tho' there are &s;everal of them; for they ri&s;e unregarded in the Banks of the Inclo&s;ures, and on the Sides of the Hill, &s;o that their Number is hardly known.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> Lord of the Village, has built a large and convenient Hou&s;e for the Re|ception of Strangers. The Bath-room is arched over|head, and the Whole made hand&s;ome, convenient, and delightful. This Collection of tepid Waters, exceeding clear, will receive 20 People at a time to walk and
<PB N="78" REF="79">
&s;wim in. The Temper of the Water is equal to new Milk, or Blood-warm, procuring a moderate Per&s;piration. Its Effect is remarkable for giving that gentle Relaxation of the Solids; which takes off the Wearine&s;s and Fatigue of a Journey, and refre&s;hes in&s;tantly. 'Tis phy&s;ically u&s;eful in many Ca&s;es, and may be indulg'd in more, than the Hot-baths of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> which frequently do Harm thro' impru|dent U&s;e. Such a one as this naturally is, was aimed at by the &s;umptuous Bagnio's of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|perors.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Delves,</HI> who received a Cure here, gave the Pump, and a pretty Stone Alcove over the Drink|ing-&s;pring in the Yard. The Water may be rai&s;ed at plea&s;ure to any Height. We found in one of the Rooms the&s;e Ver&s;es written upon the Wall by a Phy&s;ician who formerly frequented the Place:

<P>About half a Mile off is that &s;tupendous Cavern, called <HI>Poole's-hole,</HI> at the Foot of a great Mountain, and deemed the <HI>Second</HI> Wonder of the <HI>Peak.</HI> The Entrance is &s;o low and narrow, that you mu&s;t &s;toop to get in; but immediately it dilates into a wide and lofty Concavity, which reaches above a Quarter of a Mile end-wi&s;e, and farther, as they &s;ay. Some old Women with lighted Candles are Guides in this dark Way. Water drops every-where from the Roof, and incru&s;ts all the Stones with long Cry&s;tals and Fluors, whence a thou&s;and imaginary Figures are &s;hewn you by the Name of Lions, Fonts, Lanterns, Organs, Flitch of Bacon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At length you come to the Queen of <HI>Scots Pillar,</HI> as the Boun|dary of mo&s;t Peoples Curio&s;ity. It was &s;o named by that unhappy Prince&s;s, when &s;he vi&s;ited this
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Place: Nor needed &s;he any other Monument; for, by this Incident, &s;he may be &s;aid to have erected one to her Memory, which will probably la&s;t as long as the Works of Nature; tho' every one almo&s;t that comes hither, carries away a Piece of it, in Memory of the Prince&s;s, or the Place. It is a clear bright Stone like Alaba&s;ter, or rather like that kind of Spar, which is found about Lead; and con&s;idering the Country where it grows, is probably &s;omething of that Sort.</P>
<P>A Stream of Water runs along the Middle, among the falling Rocks, with a hideous Noi&s;e, re-echo'd from all Sides of the horrid Concave. On the Left-hand is a Sort of Chamber, where they &s;ay <HI>Poole,</HI> a famous Robber, lived, and who&s;e Kit|chen, as well as Bed-chamber, they &s;hew you, after you have crept 10 Yards on all Fours.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Thing you meet with in it, is the extraordinary Height of the Arch, which how|ever is far from what a late Author has magnified it to, a Quarter of a Mile perpendicular. Dr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;pends &s;ome Time in admiring the &s;pangled Roof. <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Hobbes</HI> are exceedingly witty upon it. Dr. <HI>Leigh</HI> calls it <HI>Fret-work, Organ,</HI> and <HI>Choir-work.</HI> The Whole of the Matter is this: The Rock being every-where moi&s;t and dropping, &s;ome of the Drops are fallen, which you &s;ee below; &s;ome are falling, and others are pendent in the Roof. Now, as you have Guides before you and behind, carrying every one a Candle, the Light of the Candles, reflected by the globular Drops of Water, dazle your Eyes like the Dew in a Sun-&s;hine Morning; whereas, were any Part of the Arch of this Vault to be &s;een by a clear Light, all this Beauty would di&s;appear.</P>
<P>Let any Per&s;on therefore, who goes into <HI>Poole's Hole,</HI> and has a Mind to make the Experiment, take a long Pole in his Hand, with a Cloth tied to the End of it, and wipe the Drops of Water away, he
<PB N="81" REF="82">
will at once extingui&s;h all tho&s;e Glories. Then let him wait till other Drops emerge, and he will find the Stars and Spangles glittering as before.</P>
<P>As to the &s;everal Stones, called <HI>Cotton's Stone, Haycock's Stone, Poole's Chair, Flitch of Bacon,</HI> and the like, they do not enough re&s;emble what they are &s;aid to repre&s;ent, as to be the Foundation of even a Poetick Metamorpho&s;is.</P>
<P>The petrifying Water indeed might have exerci&s;ed <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Fancy: for you &s;ee Drops pendent like Icicles, or ri&s;ing up like Pyramids, and hardening into Stone, ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of what the Poet de|&s;cribes of Stones being &s;often'd into Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Wonder of the <HI>Peak</HI> is <HI>Mam Tor,</HI> or, as the Word in the Mountain Jargon, or rather in the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> &s;ignifies, the <HI>Mother Rock,</HI> (for <HI>Mam</HI> is the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word for Mother) upon a Sugge&s;tion, that the &s;oft crumbling Earth, which falls from its Summit, produces &s;everal other Mountains below. The Whole of the Wonder is this: On the South Side of this Hill is a Precipice, very &s;teep from the Top to the Bottom; and the Sub&s;tance being of a crumb|ling loo&s;e Earth mingled with &s;mall Stones, is con|tinually falling down in &s;mall Quantities, as the heavy Rains loo&s;en and wa&s;h it off, or as Fro&s;ts and Thaws operate upon it. Now, the great Hill, which is thick, as well as high, parts with this loo&s;e Stuff, without being &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; &s;o the Bottom, into which it falls, being narrow, is more ea&s;ily per|ceived to &s;well. Here then is the pretended Won|der, That the little Heap below &s;hould grow up into a Hill, without any Decrea&s;e of the great Hill, as it &s;hould &s;eem, notwith&s;tanding &s;o much has fallen from it. But the Fact is certainly otherwi&s;e, tho' not perceivable.</P>
<P>This Hill lies on the North Side of the Road from <HI>Buxton</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;tleton,</HI> at which Place you come to the <HI>Fourth</HI> much famed Wonder, &s;tyled <HI>The Devil's</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="83">
<HI>Ar&s;e in the Peak.</HI> The &s;hort Account of it is this: On the &s;teep Side of a Mountain is a large Open|ing, almo&s;t in the Form of an old <HI>Gothick</HI> Arch, from its Centre, only that the Entrance is horizontal. It is upwards of 30 Feet perpendicular, and twice as much broad at the Bottom at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>It continues thus wide but a little Way, yet far enough to have &s;everal &s;mall Cottages built on either Side of it within the Entrance, like a little Town in a Vault. In the Middle, as it were, of the Street, is a running Stream of Water: in poetical De|&s;criptions it is called a River, tho' not the River <HI>Styx.</HI></P>
<P>As you go on, the Roof de&s;cends gradually, and is now &s;o far from having Hou&s;es, that a Man can|not &s;tand upright in it till &s;tooping for a little Way, and pa&s;&s;ing over another Rill of Water, likewi&s;e called a River, you find more Room over your Head. But going a little farther, you come to a third Water, which cro&s;&s;es your Way; and the Rock &s;tooping, as it were, down almo&s;t to the Surface of the Water, puts an End to the Traveller's Search.</P>
<P>But when we read in Scripture, that the Caves of <HI>Adullam</HI> and <HI>Macpelah</HI> were able to receive <HI>David</HI> and his Troop of 400 Men, and what Travellers relate of a Cave in the <HI>Apennine</HI> Mountains, near <HI>Florence,</HI> large enough to contain an Army; and when we know, that there are many others in the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and the Hills of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> and other Parts of the World; this &s;urely can be thought no Wonder, unle&s;s we credit <HI>Gervai&s;e</HI> of <HI>Tilbury,</HI> who tells us of a Shepherd, that ventured into the third River in this Den, and being either carried over it, or down the Stream, he knew not whether, &s;aw a beautiful heavenly Country beyond it, with a &s;pa|cious Plain, watered with many clear Rivers, plea&s;ant Brooks, and &s;everal Lakes of &s;tanding Water.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84"><HI>Ca&s;tleton</HI> takes its Name from the Ca&s;tle that lies near it, which is a very antient Building, and &s;o &s;ituated as to be only one Way acce&s;&s;ible, being erected on an high &s;teep Rock; and the Way, that goes to it, is &s;o full of Twinings and Turnings, that it is Two Miles from the Bottom to the Top.</P>
<P>Not far off is a little Village called <HI>Burgh,</HI> fre|quented by the <HI>Romans,</HI> on account of the Baths, as appears evidently by a Cau&s;way leading from hence thither.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fifth</HI> Wonder is called <HI>Tide&s;well,</HI> or <HI>Weeden|well,</HI> a Spring which, according to &s;ome Writers, ebbs and flows, as the Sea does. The Ba&s;in, or Receiver for the Water, is about Three Foot Square; the Water &s;eems to have &s;ome other Receiver with|in the Rock, which, when it fills by the Force of the original Stream, the Air being contracted, or pent in, forces the Water out with a bubbling Noi&s;e, and &s;o fills the Receiver without; but when the Force is &s;pent within, then it &s;tops till the Place is filled again; and, in the mean time, the Water with|out runs off, till the Quantity within &s;wells again, and then the &s;ame Cau&s;e produces the &s;ame Effect. So that this <HI>Oceanet,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> calls it, which has been the Subject of &s;everal Philo&s;ophick Inqui|ries, is owing wholly to the Figure of the Place, and is only a mere Accident in Nature; and if any Per|&s;on were to dig into the narrow Cavities, and give vent to the Air, which is pent up within, they would &s;oon &s;ee <HI>Tide&s;well</HI> turned into an ordinary Stream.</P>
<P>This Spring lies near the little Market-town of <HI>Tidde&s;wall,</HI> wherein are a very good Church, and a Free-&s;chool.</P>
<P>So much for the <HI>Five fictitious</HI> Wonders: I come now to the <HI>Two</HI> real Wonders, <HI>Elden Hole,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s fine Hou&s;e at <HI>Chat&s;worth</HI>; the one natural, the other artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85">In the Middle of a plain open Field, gently de|&s;cending to the South, is this frightful Cha&s;m in the Earth, or rather in the Rock, called <HI>Elden Hole.</HI> The Mouth of it is about 20 Feet over one Way, and 50 or 60 the other, de&s;cending down perpendi|cular to the Earth; how deep, could never yet be di&s;covered, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal Attempts have been made to find its Bottom. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> &s;ays, he let down 800 Fathom of Line, which is 1600 Yards, near a Mile perpendicular.</P>
<P>The Author has poetically enough de&s;cribed the Noi&s;e the huge ma&s;&s;y Stones make, which the Coun|try People often throw down here. The Hi&s;&s;ing of Spears and Arrows is &s;eldom omitted in Poetry to de&s;cribe the Terror they bring: he has here improved a &s;imilar Noi&s;e into a Mark of Fear.<Q><L><HI>When one's turn'd off, it, as it parts the Air,</HI></L>

<P>They tell a di&s;mal Story here of a Traveller, who inquiring his Way to <HI>Ca&s;tleton,</HI> or to <HI>Buxton,</HI> in a dark Night, two Villains offered to guide him; but, intending to rob him, led him to the Edge of this Gulph, and either thru&s;t him in, or made him be|lieve there was a little Gull of Water, and bad him take a large Step, which he did into this Aby&s;s, and into that of Eternity at the &s;ame time. One of the
<PB N="85" REF="86">
Villains, being hanged at <HI>Derby</HI> &s;ome Years after for &s;ome other Roguery, confe&s;&s;ed this diabolical Action at the Gallows.</P>
<P>It rai&s;es an Horror in the Imagination, when one does but look into this frightful Hole; and &s;o I &s;hall leave it with the Words of the forementioned Author, who, &s;uppo&s;ing it one of the Entrances to the Infernal World, &s;ays,
<Q><L><HI>For he, who, &s;tanding on the Brink of Hell,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can carry it &s;o unconcern'd and well,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As to betray no Fear, is certainly</HI></L>
<L><HI>A</HI> better <HI>Chri&s;tian, or a</HI> wor&s;e, <HI>than I.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I come now to the magnificent Seat of the Earls and Dukes of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> called <HI>Chat&s;worth-hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This glorious Fabrick may be &s;aid to have had two or three different Founders, who have all improved upon one another, in the Completion of this great De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was begun on a much narrower Plan than it now takes up, by Sir <HI>William Cavendi&s;h</HI> of <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who by Marriage with the Counte&s;s Dowager of <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> became intitled to a noble Fortune in this Country.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> died, after having done little more than build one End of the Fabrick, and lay out the Plan of the Whole. But his Lady fini&s;hed it in the mag|nificent manner which it appeared in, when it was was fir&s;t ranked among the Wonders of the <HI>Peak.</HI> And if it de&s;erved to be &s;o ranked then, how much more does it now, with the additional Improvements made by the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire!</HI></P>
<P>One Thing is ob&s;ervable, That the very Di&s;ad|vantages of Situation contribute to the Beauty of the Place, and, by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Management, are made &s;ub&s;ervient to the Builder's De&s;ign. On the Ea&s;t Side, not far di&s;tant, ri&s;es a prodigious high
<PB N="86" REF="87">
Mountain, which is &s;o thick planted with beautiful Trees, that you only &s;ee a ri&s;ing Wood gradually a&s;cending, as if the Trees crouded one above the other to admire the &s;tately Pile before them.</P>
<P>Upon the Top of this Mountain they dig Mill|&s;tones; and here begins a va&s;t extended Moor, which for 15 or 16 Miles together due North, has neither Hedge, Hou&s;e, or Tree, but a wa&s;te and houling Wilderne&s;s, over which, when Strangers travel, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to find their Way without Guides.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more &s;urpri&s;ing of its Kind, to a Traveller, who comes from the North, when, after a tedious Progre&s;s thro' &s;uch a di&s;mal De&s;art, on a &s;udden the Guide brings him to this Precipice, where he looks down from a comfortle&s;s, barren, and, as he thought, endle&s;s Moor, into the mo&s;t delightful Valley, and &s;ees a beautiful Palace, adorn'd with fine Gardens. If Contraries illu&s;trate each other, here they are &s;een in the &s;tronge&s;t Oppo&s;ition. It is really &s;urpri&s;ing to think what a Genius it mu&s;t be, that &s;hould lay out &s;o great a De&s;ign in &s;uch a Place, where the Mountains intercept the Clouds, and threaten, were Earthquakes frequent here, to bury whole Towns, and, what &s;eems equal to a Town, this Hou&s;e, in their Ruins.</P>
<P>On the Plain, which extends from the Top of this Mountain, is a large Body of Water, which takes up near 30 Acres, and, from the A&s;cents round it, receives, as into a Ci&s;tern, all the Water that falls; which, thro' Pipes, &s;upplies the Ca&s;cades, Waterworks, Ponds, and Canals, in the Gardens.</P>
<P>Before the We&s;t Front of the Hou&s;e, which is the mo&s;t beautiful, and where the fir&s;t Foundre&s;s built a very augu&s;t Portal, runs the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> which, tho' not many Miles here from its Source, yet is a ra|pid River, when, by ha&s;ty Rains, or the melting of Snows, the Hills pour down their Waters into its Chanel; for the Current, by rea&s;on of its many
<PB N="87" REF="88">
contracted Pa&s;&s;ages among the Rocks, (Pieces of which, of an incredible Bulk, come &s;ometimes roll|ing down its Stream) on the lea&s;t Motion of its Waters, above their ordinary Height, roars like the Breaches on the Shores of the Sea.</P>
<P>Over this River is a &s;tately Stone Bridge, with an antient Tower upon it, and in an I&s;land in the River an antient Fabrick all of Stone, and built like a Ca&s;tle; which are the Works of the &s;aid Foundre&s;s, and &s;hew the Greatne&s;s of the original De&s;ign; but are all, except the Bridge, eclip&s;ed, as it were, by the modern Glories of the late Edifice.</P>
<P>The Front to the Garden is a regular Piece of Architecture. The Frize under the Cornice has the Motto of the Family upon it in gilt Letters, &s;o large as to take up the whole Front, tho' the Words are the&s;e two, CAVENDO TVTVS; which is no le&s;s applicable to the Situation of the Hou&s;e, than the Name of the Family.</P>
<P>The Sa&s;hes of the &s;econd Story, we were told, are 17 Feet high, of poli&s;hed Looking-gla&s;s, two Feet wide; and the Wood-work double-gilt.</P>
<P>Under this Front lie the Gardens exqui&s;itely fine; and, to make a clear Vi&s;ta or Pro&s;pect beyond into the flat Country, towards <HI>Hardwick,</HI> another Seat of the &s;ame Owner, the Duke (to whom tho&s;e Things which others thought impo&s;&s;ible, were practicable) removed a great Mountain that &s;tood in the Way, and which interrupted the Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the u&s;ual Approach to this noble Fabrick, it pre&s;ents it&s;elf thus: Fir&s;t, the River, which in calm Weather glides gently by; then a venerable Walk of Trees, where the famous <HI>Hobbes</HI> u&s;ed often to con|template; a noble Piece of Iron-work Gates and Balu&s;ters, expo&s;e the Front of the Hou&s;e and Court, terminated at the Corners next the Road with two large Stone Pede&s;tals of <HI>Attick</HI> Work, curiou&s;ly adorned with Trophies of War, and Uten&s;ils of all
<PB N="88" REF="89">
the Sciences, in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo.</HI> This Part of the Building is <HI>Ionick,</HI> the Whole being a Square of a &s;ingle Order, but every Side of a different Model: a Court in the Middle with a Piazza of <HI>Dorick</HI> Columns of one Stone each, overlaid with prodigious Architraves. The Stone is of an excellent Sort, veined like Marble, hewn out of the neighbouring Quarries, and tumbled down the adjacent Hill. In the Ante-room to the Hall are flat Stones of 14 Feet &s;quare, laid upon the Heads of Four Pillars, and &s;o throughout. In the Hall-&s;tairs the Landing-&s;teps are of the &s;ame Di|men&s;ions; the Doors, Chimneys, Window-ca&s;es, Stairs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all of Marble; the Ceilings and Walls of all the Apartments charged with rare Painting of <HI>Varrio,</HI> and other famous Hands; the Bath-room, all of Marble curiou&s;ly wrought.</P>
<P>The Chapel is a mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Place; the Altar|end and Floor, Marble; the Seats and Gallery, Cedar; the re&s;t of the Wall and Ceiling, painted.</P>
<P>The Gardens abound with Green-hou&s;es, Sum|mer-hou&s;es, Walks, Wilderne&s;&s;es, Orangeries, with all the proper Furniture of Statues, Urns, Greens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Canals, Ba&s;ons, and Water-works of va|rious Forms and Contrivance; as Sea-hor&s;es, Drakes, Dolphins, and other Fountains, that throw up the Water. An artificial Willow-tree of Copper &s;pouts dropping Water from every Leaf. A wonderful Ca&s;cade, where from a neat Hou&s;e of Stone, like a Temple, out of the Mouths of Bea&s;ts, Pipes, Urns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a whole River de&s;cends, the Slope of a Hill a Quarter of a Mile in Length, over Steps, with a terrible Noi&s;e, and broken Appearance, till it is lo&s;t under-ground. Beyond the Garden, upon the Hills, is a Park, and that over-look'd by a very high and rocky Mountain. Here are &s;ome Statues, and other Antiquities.</P>
<P>I &s;hould never have done, were I to &s;ay all that might be &s;aid of this augu&s;t Palace. But two hi&s;to|rical
<PB N="89" REF="90">
Circum&s;tances in its Honour mu&s;t not be for|gotten, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Mary,</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> whom we had occa&s;ion to mention as a Vi&s;itant of the <HI>Peak,</HI> was for 17 Years in Cu&s;tody in this Hou&s;e, under the Care of the celebrated Foundre&s;s of it. In Memory of this Royal Captive, the new Lodgings, that are built in&s;tead of the old, are &s;till called the <HI>Queen's of</HI> Scots <HI>Apartment.</HI> Happy for her, could &s;he have been allow'd to have paid the &s;ame fine Compliment to the Owner of it, which the Count <HI>de Tallard</HI> did, and is our other hi&s;torical Circum&s;tance, when he had been entertained for a few Days by the late Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire: When I return,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>into my own Country, and reckon up the Days of my Captivity, I &s;hall leave out tho&s;e I &s;pent at</HI> Chat&s;worth.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e all I have to &s;ay of this famous Pa|lace, as I may call it, with the following brief Ex|tract from the Letter of an ingenious Gentleman to his Friend: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"This Place, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> exceeds all the high Ideas and De&s;criptions that were ever given me of it. The Hou&s;e yields to nothing in <HI>Europe</HI>; it is prodigiou&s;ly great in every Part. I never &s;aw &s;uch a Number of fine Rooms; but the Situation &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es all. Nature has laid her&s;elf out, in amazing Variety of Greatne&s;s and Pro&s;pects; a fine River below, with fine Banks, &s;ome naked and rocky, others declining and woody, many &s;mooth, and proper for Walking; large Groves and Fi&s;hponds, and Canals between the River and the Hou&s;e, which ri&s;es proudly upon &s;everal Terraces, and has behind it a great Lawn, intermixed with Plant|ations, and great Walks, all ri&s;ing one above an|other, at fir&s;t gently, afterwards over va&s;t Preci|pices, to the Top of a high Mountain, which was all covered upon the Brows with high Trees, two or three Miles on either Side; then breaks into a thou&s;and Vales, and green Hills; then, re|&s;uming
<PB N="90" REF="91">
its former Height and Bulk, proceeds again a mighty Mountain, covered with Rocks and Heath; its Sides in many Places adorned with Wood; the Whole yielding a mo&s;t exten&s;ive Pro&s;pect of many Miles. Every body has heard of the great Ca&s;cade."</P></Q></P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e other Curio&s;ities in the <HI>Peak</HI> which I need but ju&s;t mention; as the Tottering Stones at <HI>Byrch Over,</HI> &s;tanding upon a hard Rock, one of them &s;aid to be four Yards high, 12 round, and yet re&s;ts upon a Point &s;o equally poi&s;ed, that it may be moved with a Finger; the <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;e|way, called <HI>Bath-gate</HI>; the &s;everal Minerals found in the Hills, and in the Lead Mines, as Black Lead, <HI>Stibium,</HI> or Antimony, and Cry&s;tal.</P>
<P><HI>Bakewell</HI> is the be&s;t Town in the North-we&s;t Side of the <HI>Peak:</HI> it lies on the Banks of the <HI>Wye,</HI> and has a good Market; the Pari&s;h is exempt from Epi|&s;copal Juri&s;diction. Near this the Duke of <HI>Rutland</HI> has a very noble Palace, called <HI>Haddon,</HI> now intirely uninhabited. It was antiently the Seat of the <HI>Vernons,</HI> &s;ome of whom were Members of Parliament for this County as early as <HI>Edward</HI> III. Sir <HI>George Vernon,</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, was &s;tyled King of the <HI>Peak,</HI> and his Daughter being married to <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Son of the fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> it came into the Family of the <HI>Manners.</HI></P>
<P>The extended Angle of this County, which runs a great way North-we&s;t by <HI>Chappel</HI> in the <HI>Frith,</HI> (which was formerly a Market-town) and which they call <HI>High Peak,</HI> is perhaps the mo&s;t de&s;olate, wild, and abandoned Country in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Mountains of the <HI>Peak,</HI> of which I have been &s;peaking, &s;eem to be but the Beginning of Wonders to this Part of the Country; the Tops of who&s;e Hills &s;eem to be as much above the Clouds, as the Clouds are above the ordinary Hills.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">Nor is this all; the Countenance of the&s;e Moun|tains is &s;uch, that they have no Bounds to them but the Sea; they run on in a continued Ridge from one to another, even to the Highlands in <HI>Scotland</HI>; &s;o that they may be &s;aid to divide <HI>Britain,</HI> as the <HI>Apennine</HI> Mountains divide <HI>Italy.</HI> Thus joining to <HI>Black&s;tone Edge,</HI> they divide <HI>York&s;hire</HI> from <HI>Lanca|&s;hire,</HI> and going on North, divide the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham</HI> from <HI>We&s;tmorland,</HI> and &s;o on.

<P>We went next to <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> a hand&s;ome popu|lous Town, &s;ituate between Rivulets, on the South Side of a Hill, North-ea&s;t from <HI>Chat&s;worth,</HI> well built and well inhabited, notwith&s;tanding it &s;tands in the Extremity of this rocky Country; for being on the North Side of the County next to <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> it leads into the Hundred of <HI>Scar&s;dale,</HI> which is a rich fertile Part of the Country, tho' &s;urrounded with barren Moors and Mountains, for &s;uch the Name <HI>Scar&s;dale</HI> &s;ignifies. It is a Mayor-town of great Antiquity, and was made a free Borough by King <HI>John.</HI> It is now a Place of con&s;iderable Merchandice and Dealings in Lead, Grocery, Mercery, Melting of Barley, Tanning, Stockens, Blankets, Bedding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which they have great Intercour&s;e to and

It has a fair Church. The Spire of its Steeple, being Timber covered with Lead, is warped all awry. It has al&s;o a Free-&s;chool, and a new large Market-place, which is well &s;upply'd with Lead, and with the Commodities above-mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Dornfield</HI> is a &s;mall Market-town, noted only for its high Situation, ju&s;t on the Edge of the <HI>Peak.</HI></P>
<P>We are now entered into the County of <HI>York,</HI> which is of larger Extent than any two Counties in <HI>England</HI> joined together, being in Compa&s;s 360 Miles. Its Figure is a large Square, and is adequate to the Dukedom of <HI>Wirtemburgh</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and contains more Ground than all the Seven <HI>United Provinces.</HI> I was at fir&s;t puzzled which way to direct my Cour&s;e in this large County; but at la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;trike thro' the Middle of the County, and along the North-ea&s;t Part of the We&s;t Riding, up as far as <HI>Rippon,</HI> which is about the Centre of the County.</P>
<P>This great County is divided into Three Ridings, North, Ea&s;t, and We&s;t Riding. This la&s;t, which I chu&s;e fir&s;t to &s;peak of, is much the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous, and has in it the greate&s;t Number of Towns, as well as the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and like|wi&s;e the be&s;t Manufactures, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t Share of Riches.</P>
<P><HI>Sheffield,</HI> &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Ground, is the fir&s;t Town we came to from <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI> It is famous for Whittle-making, Cutlery Wares and Iron-work, there being a great many good Iron Mines about it, and likewi&s;e &s;ome of Alum. The Town is very antient, and has been always con&s;iderable, tho' no Corporation; and that it was noted, in <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s
<PB N="93" REF="94">
Time, for the &s;ame Trade, appears by tho&s;e Lines of his:
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; A Miller &mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>With a rizzled Beard, and a hooked No&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And a</HI> Sheffield <HI>Whittle in his Ho&s;e.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The Town is very populous and large, and the Hou&s;es built with Stone, but look dark and black, by the continued Smoke of the Forges, which are always at Work; and the Streets are narrow. Here were &s;et up the fir&s;t Mills for turning Grind-&s;tones in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Church is very large and &s;pacious, in the Form of a Cro&s;s, and has a fine high Spire.</P>
<P><HI>Sheffield</HI> is reputed to excel <HI>Birmingham</HI> in Cutlery Wares and Files, and <HI>Birmingham</HI> is allow'd to out-do <HI>Sheffield</HI> in Locks, Hinges, Nails, and poli&s;h'd Steel.</P>
<P>The Cutlers here are incorporated by the Style of <HI>The Cutlers of Hallam&s;hire,</HI> and have many Privi|leges. They are &s;aid to be 600 in Number, and are called <HI>Ma&s;ter-cutlers</HI>; each of whom gives a parti|cular Stamp to his Wares. The Corporation chu&s;e a Ma&s;ter and other Officers yearly; and it is judged, that no le&s;s than 40000 are imploy'd in the Iron|trade in <HI>Sheffield,</HI> and the adjacent Tract of Land called <HI>Hallam&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it will be judged, that the &s;aid Pari&s;h-church, the only one in this populous Town, was not able to contain one half of the People of <HI>Sheffield</HI>; which induced one Mr. <HI>Robert Downes,</HI> Gold&s;mith of this Town, to contribute a large Sum, and to procure other Sums by Contributions, for erecting a Chapel of Ea&s;e; and accordingly he got Leave, <HI>Anno</HI> 1719, from <HI>William</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> to proceed in &s;o good a Work, and built a hand&s;ome and &s;tately Structure on a Piece of Ground called <HI>Shaw-clo&s;e,</HI> purcha&s;ed by the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Downes,</HI> who al&s;o &s;ettled to the Value of 30<HI>l.</HI> a Year for ever, on

a Preacher, to be elected and nominated by him, his Heirs and A&s;&s;igns.</P>
<P>But tho' the Building was thus fini&s;hed, and Mr. <HI>Downes</HI> had actually nominated to it, his Nephew <HI>Jo&s;eph Downes,</HI> yet the Nomination being conte&s;ted by the Patrons of the Vicarage of <HI>Sheffield,</HI> and the Vicar al&s;o, it remained uncon&s;ecrated till the Year 1739; when the Parties differing, coming to an Agreement, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, confirm|ing the &s;ame; and it is now con&s;ecrated by the Name of <HI>The Chapel of</HI> St. Paul <HI>in the Town of</HI> Sheffield.</P>
<P>Formerly here was a very fine Ca&s;tle, with a no|ble Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, the Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Nor|folk</HI>; but it is now all demoli&s;hed and decayed, tho' the Manor remains &s;till in the Family.</P>
<P>In the great Church, in this Town, are &s;everal very antient Monuments of the Family of <HI>Talbots,</HI> Earls of <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> who once had great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this and the next County.</P>
<P>In particular, <HI>George,</HI> the fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> who died 1531. <HI>George</HI> the &s;econd, Grand&s;on to the fir&s;t, under who&s;e Care the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> was here in Cu&s;tody for 16 Years, who died 1590, and <HI>Gilbert</HI> his Son, who founded the &s;tately Ho&s;pital in this Town, all lie buried here.</P>
<P>The Gift of this Ho&s;pital is perpetuated in the following In&s;cription:
<Q><HI>The Ho&s;pital of the Right Honourable</HI> GILBERT <HI>Earl of</HI> Shrew&s;bury, <HI>erected and &s;ettled by the Right Honourable</HI> HENRY <HI>Earl of</HI> Norwich, <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal of</HI> ENGLAND, <HI>great Grand&s;on of the &s;aid Earl, in pur&s;uance of his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament,</HI> Anno 1673.</Q></P>
<P>Here is a fine Engine for rai&s;ing Water to &s;upply the Town. Here is al&s;o a very large and &s;trong
<PB N="95" REF="96">
Bridge over the <HI>Dun,</HI> as there is another at <HI>Rother|ham,</HI> a Market-town Six Miles lower. Of late &s;everal Acts of Parliament have pa&s;&s;ed to make this River further navigable to different Places, which will greatly increa&s;e the Trade of tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>It is in the Park here, that the great Oak-tree grew formerly, of which Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> gives a long Account in his Book of Fore&s;t-trees. And what became of the Che&s;nut-tree near <HI>Aderclift,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Camden</HI>'s Continuator, the Body of which could hardly be fathomed by three Men, I could hear no Account of.</P>
<P>The Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortification between <HI>Sheffield</HI> and <HI>Rotherham</HI> are &s;till to be &s;een, and probably will continue to the End of Time.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o the famous Trench, by &s;ome called <HI>Devil's Bank,</HI> other <HI>Danes Bank</HI>; which is &s;aid to run Five Miles in Length, and in &s;ome Places is called <HI>Kemp Bank,</HI> in others <HI>Temple's Bank.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rotherham</HI> is the next Market-town North-ea&s;t of <HI>Sheffield.</HI> It is noted for its fine Stone Bridge over the <HI>Dun,</HI> which is here increa&s;ed by the River <HI>Rother,</HI> from whence the Town, no doubt, took its Name.</P>
<P>The Church is built in the Form of a Cathedral, and is a fair Stone Building, with a hand&s;ome Spire Steeple.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rotherham</HI> we turned North-we&s;t to <HI>Went|worth,</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee the old Seat of the <HI>Went|worths,</HI> who have flouri&s;hed here ever &s;ince the Conque&s;t, and been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the E&s;tate of <HI>Wood|hou&s;e</HI> from the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> III. Among the &s;everal noble Per&s;ons of this Family, who have re&s;ided here, was the great <HI>Thomas Wentworth,</HI> Earl of <HI>Straf|ford,</HI> beheaded in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who&s;e Body lies buried in this Church. His Honours were extinct in his Son; but his Seat is &s;till in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>Thomas Wentworth,</HI> Earl of <HI>Malton,</HI> his Great Grand&s;on, who has made &s;uch Improvements to it,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
that it is inferior to few in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It is &s;ituated on the Side of a Hill, defended from the North and We&s;t, but opens to the South and Ea&s;t, towards which Quarters it commands a very exten|&s;ive Pro&s;pect over a rich and beautiful Country, which belongs to the Family.</P>
<P>The Gardens are large, and adorn'd with Obe|li&s;ks, Statues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> having a Green-hou&s;e and Bath|ing-room. On one Side there is an uninterrupted View into the Park and Neighbourhood. Here are two Beauties rarely to be met with any-where el&s;e, a Grove of old Fir-trees, and a Mount of above 100 Feet high perpendicularly mea&s;ured. The Cir|cumference of the Parks is about eight Miles, and is beautified with Fi&s;h-ponds, Woods of Timber of an uncommon Size, and with Plantations innumer|able. The Turf is of a fine Verdure, and the Soil fruitful.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, with the Additions lately made, and now carrying on, will extend 200 Yards in Front, and is built in Imitation of <HI>Wan&s;tead</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Seat of Earl <HI>Tilney.</HI> And an Improvement has been added to the Park and Fi&s;h-ponds, one whereof, con&s;i&s;ting of 14 Acres of Ground, receives a &s;mall Brook, which being conducted through a winding Cut, for 600 Yards, falling down &s;ix Steps, is brought by a Canal of 300 Yards into the Lake, and &s;o affords a pretty Pro&s;pect of Water for near a Mile together.</P>
<P>From hence we went to &s;ee <HI>Stamborough,</HI> a fine Seat now belonging to the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>; the late Earl built the Hou&s;e here, which has an exceed|ing noble Front, and adorn'd it with large Planta|tions, fine Water-works, and Gardens; to which if we add the Vi&s;ta's, Walks, and Woods, which are large and numerous, it may vie with mo&s;t Seats in <HI>Great Britain</HI> for Elegancy.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">We afterwards &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e back again to <HI>Rotherham,</HI> and leaving that Town, came to <HI>Sand|beck,</HI> a fine Seat of the Earl of <HI>Scarborough</HI>; which, con&s;idering the beautiful Lawn before the Hou&s;e, and the Extent of the adjoining Woods, remarkable for the Improvements of Art, as well as for the Bigne&s;s and flouri&s;hing State of the Trees, may vie with mo&s;t Seats, in re&s;pect to Situation.</P>
<P>From hence we pur&s;ued a By-track, in order to &s;ee a famous Yew-tree, which &s;tands in a Field called <HI>Cuckolds Haven,</HI> and is a very &s;urpri&s;ing Pro|duction of Nature, and which I &s;hall attempt to de&s;cribe: It has a &s;trait &s;mooth Stem, about 10 Feet high, from which the Branches extend in Circles above each other, like the Divi&s;ions of a Pine|apple, and of that Shape, and of equal Exactne&s;s. The Figure of the Tree is much more beautiful than could have been made by Art of Man. The Branches from Top to Bottom are &s;o thick, that a Bird can &s;carce creep through them in any Part; and every Shoot and Fibre put out the &s;ame Length each Year, and are of &s;o bright and plea&s;ant a Green in all Sea&s;ons, that at &s;ome Di&s;tance the Cloathing of the Tree appears like Velvet. There is a Hedge planted round it for a Fence, and many People have thought it worth their while to ride 20 Miles to view it.</P>
<P>Upon Sight of this Curio&s;ity, and Thou&s;ands of other Trees of the &s;ame Species in its Neighbour|hood, I could not but lament, that Avarice &s;hould &s;o far prevail, e&s;pecially with Gentlemen, as to con&s;ent to grant what I call a dead Warrant for the &s;elling of many noble &s;tately ones, in the Height of their Glory, which for &s;ome Hundred of Years had been an Ornament to the Places where they grew, when perhaps one of the large&s;t of them, which in a Garden or Park would be e&s;teemed above any Price,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
is &s;old for no more than 20 or 30 Shillings, to make Naves for Wheels.</P>
<P>Afterwards we &s;truck into a By-road, which brought us to the Ruins of <HI>Roch</HI> or <HI>Rock Abby,</HI> hid by a &s;teep woody Cliff, towards the South, and by large Rocks every other Way, except Ea&s;tward. One Side of the Nef of this Building, from North to South, under the middle Tower, and &s;ome odd Pillars and Arches, are all that is now left, great Part having been carried away, from time to time, to repair adjacent Churches, or build Gentlemens Seats, tho' now Care is taken, by the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> to pre&s;erve what remains. The&s;e Ruins, among which large Trees are now grown up, and the contiguous Borders, make a Picture inex|pre&s;&s;ibly charming, e&s;pecially when viewed with the Lights and Shadows they receive from a We&s;tern Sun; and its reclu&s;e Situation, &s;till from every Noi&s;e, except the Murmur of a limpid Rivulet, together with the Fragments of &s;epulchral Monuments, and the gloomy Shades of tho&s;e venerable Greens, Ivy, and Yew, which creep up, and luxuriantly branch out and mix with the beautiful Whitene&s;s of the Rocks, give &s;uch a Solemnity to this Scene, as de|mands a &s;erious Reverence from the Beholder, and in&s;pires a contemplative Melancholy, oftentimes plea&s;ing as well as proper to indulge.</P>
<P>The Stone, of which this Abbey is built, was dug out of the famous Quarry near adjoining, and &s;o well known to Ma&s;ons by the Name of <HI>Roch Abbey|&s;tone,</HI> which for Whitene&s;s and Beauty is not to be equalled.</P>
<P>Another thing worthy of Notice in this Neigh|bourhood, is the Tower and Spire of the Church <HI>Laughton,</HI> which for a Delicacy and Ju&s;tne&s;s of Proportion, is not excelled by any other <HI>Gothi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Piece of the kind. How it happened, that &s;o
<PB N="99" REF="100">
elegant and ornamental a Structure, &s;uperior by far to all others round it, was be&s;tow'd upon a Village-church, is matter of &s;ome Wonder.</P>
<P>The Building &s;tands upon a very high Hill, which appears at Di&s;tance like that at <HI>Harrow</HI> in the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex.</HI> The Height of the Steeple to the Weather-cock is 195 Feet, and by its Situa|tion the mo&s;t con&s;picuous every way, of any perhaps in the whole Kingdom, being &s;een from many Places 40, 50, and 60 Miles. It has a peculiar Beauty, when view'd in the diagonal Line, the Pinacles at the Corners of the Tower being join'd by Arches to the Spire, as are others above them, which break its Out-lines, and give, at the &s;ame time, a beauti|ful Diminution; but Time will not permit it to &s;tand much longer without con&s;iderable Repairs.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> who&s;e Seat at <HI>Kiveton</HI> is at about three Miles Di&s;tance, has cut a Vi&s;ta through the Woods of his Park, to take this Steeple into his View.</P>
<P>About two Miles from <HI>Laughton</HI> we &s;aw the &s;aid Seat of <HI>Kiveton:</HI> It is an elegant Hou&s;e, and the Apart|ments and Offices are di&s;po&s;ed with great Conve|niency. The Situation is in a whol&s;ome Air, and commands fine Pro&s;pects. Here are plea&s;ant Gar|dens, and a beautiful Park.</P>
<P>We omitted vi&s;iting many other Places in the&s;e Parts, which, had Time allowed, would have an&s;wer'd the Trouble of riding uneven Roads, which are tire&s;ome hereabouts, and ha&s;tened to reach <HI>Tickhill,</HI> which is a &s;mall Market-town, and very antient.</P>
<P>Here is an old Ca&s;tle, which is large, but &s;ur|rounded with a &s;ingle Wall only, and an huge Mount, with a round Tower on the Top of it. it was antiently of &s;uch Dignity, that all the Manors round about it, belonging to it, were &s;tyled <HI>The Honour of Tickhill.</HI> The Church in this Town is very large, and a hand&s;ome Building.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">We now return'd once more to <HI>Rotherham,</HI> and pur&s;ued our Cour&s;e higher up on the River <HI>Dun,</HI> to <HI>Coningsborough</HI> Ca&s;tle, called in Briti&s;h <HI>Caer Conan,</HI> &s;ituate on a Rock, where <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;ays, That <HI>Aurelius Ambro&s;ius,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Prince, van|qui&s;h'd <HI>Hengi&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> General, and took him Pri&s;oner, where, in Revenge of his barbarous Murder of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility in cold Blood, near <HI>Stone|henge</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> he cut off his Head.</P>
<P>Before the Gate is an Agger, &s;aid to be the Bury|ing-place of <HI>Hengi&s;t.</HI> It is not only famous for its Antiquity, but its Situation too, upon a plea&s;ant A&s;cent, having &s;ix large Market-towns, 120 Villages, many large Woods of Oak, &s;ome containing 100 Acres, and others beautifully cut through into Walks, &s;ix Iron Furnaces, many Mines of Coal and Iron, Quarries of Stone for Building, nine large Stone Bridges, 40 Water-mills, &s;ix Seats of Noblemen, 60 of Gentlemen, 15 Parks, and two navigable Rivers. Upon the <HI>Dun</HI> al&s;o, a little Way from <HI>Co|ningsborough,</HI> is a Place called <HI>Temple-brough,</HI> a <HI>Ro|man</HI> Fortification, of which the North-ea&s;t Corner is wa&s;h'd away by the River. The Area is about 200 Paces long, be&s;ides the Agger; and on the Out|&s;ide of it is a large Trench, 37 Paces deep; on the other Side of it is another Trench, cover'd with large Trees.</P>
<P>Travelling North-ea&s;t from hence, we came to <HI>Bantry,</HI> which &s;tands ju&s;t at the Entrance from <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> into the We&s;t-riding, a Town ble&s;&s;ed with two great Conveniencies, which con|tribute to its Support, and make it a very well-frequented Place.<LIST>

<P>By this Navigation <HI>Bantry</HI> becomes the Centre of all the Exportation of this Part of the Country, e&s;pecially for heavy Goods, which are brought down hither from all the adjacent Countries, &s;uch as Lead, Mill-&s;tones and Grind-&s;tones from <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> wrought Iron and edged Tools of all Sorts, from the Forges at <HI>Sheffield,</HI> and from the adjacent Country called <HI>Hallam&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Donca&s;ter</HI> is a plea&s;ant Road, that never wants Repair, which is &s;omething extraordi|nary in any Part of this lower Side of the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Donca&s;ter</HI> (&s;o called from the River on which it &s;tands, and the Ca&s;tle which is now ruined) is a noble, large, &s;pacious Town, and exceeding popu|lous, govern'd by a Mayor, and carrying on a great Manufacture, principally for Stockens, Gloves, and knit Wai&s;tcoats; and as it &s;tands upon the great Northern Po&s;t-road, is full of good Inns. There is a remarkable old Column called a Cro&s;s, at the End of the Town, with a <HI>Norman</HI> In&s;cription upon it.</P>

<P>Here lies al&s;o, under a plain Grave-&s;tone in the Church, the Body of one <HI>Thomas Ellis,</HI> memorable for having been five times Mayor of the Town, for founding an Ho&s;pital there, called <HI>St. Thomas's the Apo&s;tle,</HI> and endowing it plentifully.</P>
<P>We ought not to forget, that the celebrated Sailor, Sir <HI>Martin Frobi&s;her,</HI> was born in this Town. He was the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who, in the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> di&s;cover'd the North Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Cathai,</HI> and found &s;ome Streights, which he called after his own Name, and a Foreland after the Queen's. At his fir&s;t Voyage, one of the Company brought back &s;ome black Stones, out of which the Refiners, it is &s;aid, extracted Gold; which encou|raged him to load his Ship with them afterwards: but they were then found to be fit for nothing, but to mend the Highways. He &s;ignalized him&s;elf again&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="104">
the <HI>Spani&s;h Armada</HI>; and received his Death Wound by a Shot at <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> in <HI>Britany</HI>: the Surgeon, having extracted the Bullet, left the Wadding behind; by which means the Wound mortified, and he died as &s;oon as he had brought back the Fleet to <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;et forward directly We&s;t, and came to <HI>Barne&s;ley,</HI> a little Market-town, well-built of Stone, where a Manufacture, and Iron and Steel Work, flouri&s;hes. It has a &s;moaky A&s;pect, and is called <HI>Black-Barne&s;ley</HI>; but whether on that Account, or from the Moors, which look all black, like <HI>Bag|&s;hot Heath,</HI> I know not.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e Moors, we came thro' a mo&s;t rich, plea&s;ant and populous Country to <HI>Wake|field.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wakefield</HI> is a large Town, &s;ituate upon the River <HI>Calder,</HI> (which was made navigable in the Year 1698) &s;ince which Time the Town has increa&s;ed con&s;iderably in Riches, and Number of Inhabitants. There is a hand&s;ome Stone Bridge over the River, upon which &s;tands a Chapel, erected by King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> IV. in Memory of his Father <HI>Richard,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who was &s;lain near this Place, as I &s;hall mention by-and-by. The Chapel is 10 Yards long, and &s;ix broad; and tho' very much defaced by Time, it appears to have been wrought in a very curious manner. A little above the Bridge is a Wa&s;h or Dam, over which the Water rolling, forms an admir|able Ca&s;cade of a great Length.</P>
<P>This Town con&s;i&s;ts of three great Streets, which meet in a Centre near the Church, where there might be formed a very &s;pacious Market-place, but by rea&s;on of the great Number of Inhabitants it is &s;o crouded with Buildings, that there is only a &s;mall Area round the Market-cro&s;s, which is a very ele|gant Building, being an open Colonnade of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, &s;upporting a Dome, to which you a&s;cend by an open circular Pair of Stairs, in the Centre of the
<PB N="104" REF="105">
Building. This brings you to a Room, which receives Light from a Turret on the Top, and may be called the Town-hall; for here they tran&s;act all their pub|lick Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Church is a very large and lofty <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, the Body of which was repaired in the Year 1724, but the Spire (which is one of the highe&s;t in the County) remains in the &s;ame State it was.</P>
<P>In this Town was born <HI>John Green,</HI> the famous Pinder, who fought <HI>Robin Hood</HI> &s;o manfully.</P>
<P>From the Bridge you have an agreeable View to the South-ea&s;t, where, by the Side of the River, ri&s;es a Hill, covered with Wood, at about a Mile Di&s;tance. This joins to an open Moor or Common called <HI>Heath-moor,</HI> upon which are &s;everal Gentle|mens Seats, very plea&s;antly &s;ituated.</P>
<P>South between <HI>Wakefield</HI> and a Village called <HI>San|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">,</HI> they &s;hewed us a &s;mall &s;quare Piece of Ground, which was fenced off by it&s;elf; and on which, be|fore the late Civil War, &s;tood a large Stone Cro&s;s, ju&s;t upon the Spot where the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> fight|ing de&s;perately, and refu&s;ing to yield, tho' &s;urrounded with Enemies, was killed. But tho' Religion has &s;uffered the Cro&s;s to fall, the Chapel I mentioned on the Bridge at <HI>Wakefield,</HI> the other Monument of this Battle, is &s;till pre&s;erved by being made u&s;e of for Civil Affairs. Some &s;ay there are more People here, than in the City of <HI>York,</HI> and yet it is no Cor|poration Town.</P>
<P>Here is a Market every <HI>Friday</HI> for Woollen Cloths, after the manner of that at <HI>Leeds,</HI> tho' not &s;o great; yet as all the Clothing Trade is prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, and &s;till increa&s;ing in this County, &s;o this M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ket flouri&s;hes with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot here pa&s;s by my former Ob&s;ervation, that all the great Rivers take their Beginning in the Mountains of <HI>Black&s;tone Edge</HI> and <HI>High Peak,</HI> which, as I have &s;aid, part the Counties of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and
<PB N="105" REF="106">
<HI>York,</HI> and that the&s;e Rivers all take their Cour&s;e due Ea&s;t. The <HI>Dun</HI> is the fir&s;t; the next is the <HI>Calder,</HI> now becoming a very large River at <HI>Wakefield</HI>; and the <HI>Aire</HI> is the next, which ri&s;es at the Foot of the Mountain <HI>Penigent,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> of which 'tis &s;aid proverbially:
<Q><L>Pendle-Hill <HI>and</HI> Penigent</L>
<L><HI>Are the highe&s;t Hills between</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> Trent.</L></Q></P>
<P>As the <HI>Calder</HI> runs by <HI>Halifax, Huthersfield,</HI> and thro' <HI>Wakefield</HI>; &s;o the <HI>Aire</HI> runs by <HI>Skipton, Brad|ford,</HI> and thro' <HI>Leeds,</HI> and then both join at <HI>Ca&s;tle|ford</HI> Bridge, near <HI>Pontefract,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Brad|ford,</HI> and in an united Stream form that Navigation from this trading Part of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> to <HI>Hull,</HI> which is of &s;o much Advantage to the whole County.</P>
<P>I went to &s;ee the antient Town of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> with the Ca&s;tle, where &s;o much Blood has been &s;pilt, in different Ages; for here <HI>Henry,</HI> the great Earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> who was Lord of the Ca&s;tle, and who&s;e Ance&s;tors had beautified, inlarged, and forti|fied it, was beheaded by his Nephew, King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> II. with three or four more of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Barons. Here <HI>Richard</HI> II. was murder'd, and, if Hi&s;tory may be credited, in a mo&s;t cruel manner; and here <HI>Antony</HI> Earl of <HI>Rivers,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Gray,</HI> the fir&s;t Uncle, and the other Brother-in-law to King <HI>Edward</HI> V. were beheaded by King <HI>Ri|chard</HI> III. In the late Civil Wars, a &s;mall Party of brave Fellows took this Ca&s;tle by Surprize, for the King, and de&s;perately defended it to the la&s;t Ex|tremity; but being at length obliged to yield, five of them attempted to break thro' the Be&s;iegers Camp, three of whom peri&s;hed in the Attempt.</P>
<P>The Town is large and well built, but much &s;maller than it has been. The Ca&s;tle lies in its Ruins, though not demoli&s;hed. It is a Corporation by Pre|&s;cription, and the Mayor and 12 Aldermen are al|ways
<PB N="106" REF="107">
Ju&s;tices of the Peace. 'Tis &s;aid, that antiently none could be arre&s;ted at the Market-cro&s;s, call'd <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s Cro&s;s, and a free Way leading to the Cro&s;s, with about two Yards around it was kept unpav'd in Memory of that Privilege. But in the Year 1735, the old Cro&s;s was pulled down, and a hand&s;ome Dome, &s;upported by a Colonnade of <HI>Dorick</HI> Pillars, (the Charge whereof was defrayed by a Legacy left by one <HI>Dupere,</HI> an Inhabitant of the Town) was erected for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ruins of the Ca&s;tle &s;hew it to have been a noble Pile. A round Tower, yet &s;tanding, is intire, in or near which, the Tradition is, King <HI>Richard</HI> II. was &s;lain. Adjoining to this Tower are Winding|&s;tairs, which de&s;cend into &s;everal Vaults, and &s;ub|terraneous Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h Church, which &s;tands near the Ca&s;tle, and was prodigiou&s;ly large, received &s;o much Damage in the late Civil Wars, that no more than the Shell is now left &s;tanding. It is a hand&s;ome <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, in the Form of a Cro&s;s, with a Tower in the middle, which is in good Proportion, and was formerly crown'd with a magnificent Lantern, en|riched with carved Work; but it received &s;uch Da|mage from a Cannon Shot, during the Siege of the Ca&s;tle, that it was &s;oon after blown down; and upon the Surrender of the Ca&s;tle, the Parliament did (by Re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e, of the 27th of <HI>March,</HI> 1649) grant One thou&s;and Pounds, to be rai&s;ed by Sale of the Materials of the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, to the Town of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> towards the repairing of their Place of publick Wor&s;hip, and re-edifying an Habitation for a Mini&s;ter. Part of this Grant might be ap|plied in erecting a plain Octagon Building upon the Tower, which fini&s;hes the Whole, in a manner not di&s;agreeable, tho' far inferior to the former. In the North we&s;t Corner of this Tower, are two circular Flights of Stairs, winding about the &s;ame Centre,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
with &s;eparate Entrances below, and di&s;tinct Landings above. The Inhabitants of the Town &s;till continue to bury in this Church-yard, but Divine Service is perform'd in a Chapel adjoining to the Market-place, which is very &s;pacious.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of the Market-place &s;tands the Town-hall.</P>
<P>Near the Road is a noble Seat, which belonged to the late Lord <HI>Bingley.</HI> 'Tis a new-built, beautiful Hou&s;e, with curious Gardens, tho' not very large.</P>
<P>At <HI>Pontefract</HI> the great <HI>Roman</HI> Highway, which I mentioned at <HI>Donca&s;ter,</HI> (and is vi&s;ible from thence hither in &s;everal Places, tho' not in the open Road) is plain to be di&s;cern'd; and from <HI>Ca&s;tleford</HI> Bridge, which cro&s;&s;es over the united Rivers of <HI>Aire</HI> and <HI>Cal|der,</HI> it goes on to <HI>Aberforth,</HI> and &s;o thro' <HI>Tadca&s;ter</HI> to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome Places, where this Cau&s;eway is broken up, the Cour&s;es appear to be of different Materials, the Bottom of Clay, upon that is Chalk, then Gravel, and upon the Gravel is Stone, and then Gravel upon that, and &s;o other kinds of Earth, where the fir&s;t was not to be had.</P>
<P>In &s;everal Places between this Bridge and <HI>Aber|forth,</HI> the Cau&s;eway being di&s;u&s;ed for the common Road, it appears as intire as at its fir&s;t making, tho' a Work undoubtedly of 15 or 1600 Years old. I take notice of it here, becau&s;e I have not &s;een any thing like it in any other Place of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;tleford</HI> is a Village that &s;tands near the Con|fluence of the two Rivers above, and was formerly a Place of great Con&s;ideration, in&s;omuch that &s;ome Authors call it a City. There have been dug up here divers Pieces of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin.</P>
<P><HI>Aberforth</HI> is a &s;mall Market-town, a few Miles North-ea&s;t of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> and is noted for Pin-making only.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">From <HI>Ferry-bridge,</HI> within a Mile of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> extends a large Stone Cau&s;eway, about a Mile in Length, to a Village called <HI>Brotherton,</HI> where <HI>Mar|garet,</HI> Wife of King <HI>Edward</HI> I. was forced to take up as &s;he was hunting, and was delivered of a Son, called from the Village <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Brotherton.</HI> This Son was afterwards made Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and Mar&s;hal of <HI>England.</HI> Not far from the Church is a Piece of Ground of 20 Acres, &s;urrounded with a Trench and a Wall, where, as Tradition informs us, &s;tood the Hou&s;e in which the Queen was delivered, and the Tenants are obliged by Tenure to keep it &s;urrounded with a Wall of Stone.</P>
<P><HI>Brotherton</HI> is now noted for burning Lime-&s;tone, which is brought from <HI>Tadca&s;ter</HI> in great Quantities, and carrying and di&s;per&s;ing it into the Southern Parts, which turns to very good Account, and im|ploys a great many Hands.</P>
<P>A little to the South of this Village, the great Road divides in two Parts: one goes on to the Right to <HI>York,</HI> and the other thro' <HI>Aberforth</HI> and <HI>Wetherby,</HI> over <HI>Braham-moor,</HI> to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Braham-moor</HI> a Battle was fought between the Royali&s;ts and General <HI>Fairfax,</HI> where he was wor&s;ted and wounded, but made &s;o Soldier-like a Retreat, that it gained him as great a Reputation as a Victory would have done.</P>
<P>But we followed neither of the&s;e two Roads, leaving the Towns that way for the Entertainment of another Journey; &s;o we pa&s;s'd directly We&s;t along the Banks of the <HI>Aire</HI> to <HI>Leeds,</HI> which is a large, wealthy and populous Town, &s;tanding on the North Side of the River <HI>Aire,</HI> with large Suburbs on the South Side, and both joined by a &s;tately, &s;trong Stone Bridge, &s;o large, and &s;o wide, that formerly the Cloth-market was kept upon it; and therefore the Refre&s;hment given the Clothiers by the Inn-keepers (being a Pot of Ale, a Noggin of Pottage,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
and a Trencher of broil'd or roa&s;t Beef, for Two-pence) is called the <HI>Brigg-&s;hot</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of the Manufactures, and of the Trade, &s;oon made the Market too great to be con|fined to the Brigg, &s;o that it is now kept in the High Street, beginning from the Bridge, and run|ing up North almo&s;t to the Market-hou&s;e, where the ordinary Market for Provi&s;ions begins; which al&s;o is the greate&s;t of its kind in all the North of <HI>England.</HI> You may judge of the Plenty of it, when 500 Loads of Apples have been numbered by the Mayor's Officers in a Day.</P>
<P>But the Cloth Market is chiefly to be admired as a Prodigy of its Kind, and perhaps not to be equalled in the World. The Market for Serges at <HI>Exeter</HI> is indeed a wonderful Thing, and the Money returned very great; but it is there but once a Week, where|as here it is every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the Morning, Tre&s;&s;els are placed in two Rows in the Street, &s;ometimes two Rows on a Side, cro&s;s which Boards are laid, which make a kind of temporary Counter on either Side, from one End of the Street to the other.</P>
<P>The Clothiers come early in the Morning with their Cloth; and as few bring more than one Piece, the Market-days being &s;o frequent, they goin to the Inns and Publick-hou&s;es with it, and there &s;et it down.</P>
<P>At about Six o'Clock in the Summer, and about Seven in the Winter, the Clothiers being all come by that Time, the Market Bell at the old Chapel by the Bridge rings; upon which it would &s;urpri&s;e a Stranger to &s;ee in how few Minutes, without Hurry, Noi&s;e, or the lea&s;t Di&s;order, the whole Market is filled, and all the Boards upon the Tre&s;&s;els covered with Cloth, as clo&s;e to one another as the Pieces can lie longways, each Proprietor &s;tanding behind his own Piece, who form a Mercantile Regiment,
<PB N="110" REF="111">
as it were, drawn up in a double Line, in as great Order as a Military one.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Bell has done Ringing, the Factors and Buyers of all Sorts enter the Market, and walk up and down between the Rows, as their Occa&s;ions direct. Some of them have their foreign Letters of Orders, with Patterns &s;ealed on them, in their Hands; the Colours of which they match, by holding them to the Cloths they think they agree to. When they have pitched upon their Cloth, they lean over to the Clothier, and by a Whi&s;per, in the fewe&s;t Words imaginable, the Price is &s;tated; one a&s;ks, the other bids; and they agree or di&s;agree in a Moment.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this prudent Silence is owing to the Clothiers &s;tanding &s;o near to one another; for 'tis not rea&s;onable, that one Trader &s;hould know an|other's Traffick.</P>
<P>If a Merchant has bidden a Clothier a Price, and he will not take it, he may go after him to his Hou&s;e, and tell him he has con&s;idered of it, and is willing to let him have it; but they are not to make any new Agreement for it, &s;o as to remove the Mar|ket from the Street to the Merchant's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Buyers generally walk up and down twice on each Side of the Rows, and in little more than an Hour all the Bu&s;ine&s;s is done. In le&s;s than half an Hour you will perceive the Cloth begin to move off, the Clothier taking it up upon his Shoulder to carry it to the Merchant's Hou&s;e. At about half an Hour after Eight the Market Bell rings again, upon which the Buyers immediately di&s;appear, the Cloth is all &s;old; or if any remains, it is carried back into the Inn. By Nine o'Clock the Boards and Tre&s;&s;els are removed, and the Street left at Liberty for the Market-people of other Profe&s;&s;ions, the Li|nen-drapers, Shoe-makers, Hard-ware Men, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">Thus, you &s;ee 10 or 20,000<HI>l.</HI> worth of Cloth, and &s;ometimes much more, bought and &s;old in little more than an Hour, the Laws of the Market being the mo&s;t &s;trictly ob&s;erved, that I ever &s;aw in any Market in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, How all the&s;e Goods at this Place, at <HI>Wakefield,</HI> and at <HI>Halifax,</HI> are vended and di&s;|po&s;ed of? I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there is a Home-con&s;umption; to &s;upply which, &s;everal con&s;iderable Traders in <HI>Leeds</HI> go with Droves of Pack-hor&s;es, loaden with tho&s;e Goods, to all the Fairs and Market-towns almo&s;t over the whole I&s;land, not to &s;ell by Retail, but to the Shops by Whole&s;ale; giving large Credit. 'Tis ordinary for one of the&s;e Men to carry a thou&s;and Pounds worth of Cloth with him at a Time, and having &s;old that, to &s;end his Hor&s;es back for as much more, and this very often in a Summer; for they travel chiefly at that Sea&s;on, becau&s;e of the Badne&s;s of the Roads.</P>
<P>There are others, who have Commi&s;&s;ions from <HI>London</HI> to buy, or who give Commi&s;&s;ions to Factors and Warehou&s;e-keepers in <HI>London</HI> to &s;ell for them, who not only &s;upply all the Shop-keepers and Whole|&s;ale Men in <HI>London,</HI> but &s;ell al&s;o very great Quan|tities to the Merchants, as well for Exportation to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> which take off great Quantities of the coar&s;e Goods, e&s;pecially <HI>New England, New York, Virginia,</HI> &amp;c. as al&s;o to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Merchants, who &s;end exceeding great Quan|tities to <HI>Peter&s;burg, Riga, Dantzick, Narva,</HI> and to <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Pomerania</HI>; tho' of late the Manu|factures of this kind &s;et up in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and other Northern Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> interfere a little with them.</P>
<P>The third Sorts are &s;uch as receive Commi&s;&s;ions from abroad, to buy Cloth for the Merchants chiefly in <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and in <HI>Holland, &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are not only
<PB N="112" REF="113">
many in Number, but &s;ome of them very con&s;ider|able in their Dealings, and corre&s;pond with the far|the&s;t Provinces in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>On account of this Trade it was, that the Rivers <HI>Aire</HI> and <HI>Calder</HI> were made navigable, under the Direction of Alderman <HI>Pickering,</HI> the celebrated Au|thor of the <HI>Marrow of Mathematicks,</HI> and performed at the Expence of &s;everal private Merchants, without calling in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Nobility and Gentry. By this means a Communication was opened from <HI>Leeds</HI> and <HI>Wakefield</HI> to <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> &s;o that all the Woollen Manufactures now exported, are carried by Water to <HI>Hull,</HI> and there &s;hipped for <HI>Holland, Bre|men, Hamburgh,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick.</HI> And, encouraged by the Succe&s;s of this Act, in the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 1740. an Act pa&s;&s;ed for continuing the Navi|gation of the River <HI>Calder</HI> from <HI>Wakefield</HI> to <HI>Ealand,</HI> and <HI>Halifax,</HI> which will be a farther Benefit to the Trade of tho&s;e Parts; and at the &s;ame time &s;everal other Acts pa&s;&s;ed for mending of Highways around all the&s;e Parts, to <HI>Halifax, Ealand, Donca&s;ter, York, &amp;c.</HI> which will no le&s;s promote the Commerce and Trade of this noble County.</P>
<P>There is another Trade in this Part of the Coun|try, become very con&s;iderable &s;ince the opening the above Navigation, which is the Carriage of Coals down from <HI>Wakefield</HI> and <HI>Leeds,</HI> at both which Places they have inexhau&s;tible Stores. The&s;e are carried quite down into the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and then either go up that River to <HI>York,</HI> or down to the <HI>Humber,</HI> where the <HI>Trent</HI> and <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> meet together, and which in a few Miles falls into the Sea. In this Pa&s;&s;age abun|dance of large Towns are &s;upplied with Coal, with this Advantage too, that whereas the <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Coals pay four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Chaldron Duty to the Publick, the&s;e, being only <HI>River-borne Coal,</HI> are exempted, and pay nothing: So that the City of <HI>York,</HI> which &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the fir&s;t Navigation of the&s;e
<PB N="113" REF="114">
Rivers, in this Particular, as well as in many others, daily experiences the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>I need not add, that by the &s;ame Navigation all heavy Goods, imported to <HI>Hull,</HI> are brought up the&s;e Rivers, as well as Goods brought from <HI>London,</HI> and other Parts of the Kingdom, &s;uch as Butter, Chee&s;e, Lead, Iron, Salt, Sugars, Tobacco, Fruit, Spice, Hops, Oil, Wine, Brandy, Spirits, and the like.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of <HI>Leeds</HI> is very great, being men|tioned by Venerable <HI>Bede</HI>; but it was not incorpo|rated till 2 <HI>Car.</HI> I. when Sir <HI>John Savile</HI> (afterwards Lord <HI>Savile)</HI> was made the fir&s;t honorary Alderman, in Memory of whom the Arms of the Town are adorned with his Supporters, and tho&s;e very &s;uitable, being the two <HI>Athenian</HI> Birds, &s;acred to that Godde&s;s who was deem'd the Patrone&s;s of Spinning and Weav|ing, as well as Arts in general.</P>

painted in Fre&s;co by <HI>Parmentier,</HI> who voluntarily gave this Specimen of his Art, in Gratitude for the Encouragement he had met with here. <HI>St. John</HI>'s was built in 1634, at the &s;ole Expence of Mr. <HI>Har|ri&s;on,</HI> who likewi&s;e built the Alms-hou&s;es adjoining, a Free-&s;chool, a Market-cro&s;s, and the Street called <HI>New-&s;treet,</HI> the Rents of which he appropriated to pious U&s;es.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit the New Chapel, as it is called, erected by the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in 1691; which is &s;aid to have been the fir&s;t, as it certainly is the &s;tatelie&s;t they have in the North of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Leeds</HI> we advanced Northward, and came to <HI>Harwood,</HI> a pretty little Town on the River <HI>Wherfe,</HI> over which is a very co&s;tly Bridge, and there for|merly was a &s;trong Ca&s;tle. The Church here is re|markable for &s;everal things; particularly for the In|terrment of Sir <HI>William Ga&s;coigne,</HI> who had the Courage to commit Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> afterwards K. <HI>Henry</HI> V. to the <HI>King's Bench,</HI> for affronting him while he was in the Seat of Ju&s;tice, letting him know, that though the Son might bear the Image of the King's <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> the Judge bore that of his <HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Wherfe</HI> over a fine Stone Bridge of 11 Arches. The River runs in a Bed of Stone (which makes it look as clear as Rock Water).</P>
<P>The Plenty of Stone in the North is, no doubt, the Rea&s;on why there are &s;o many noble Bridges in that Part of <HI>England,</HI> in&s;omuch that I don't remem|ber to have &s;een one of Timber from the <HI>Trent</HI> to the <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P>We travelled along the <HI>Wherfe</HI> into the <HI>Dale,</HI> that takes its Name from the River, which reaches from <HI>York</HI> about 20 Miles, enlivened almo&s;t all the Way with Gentlemens Seats at a little Di&s;tance from each other; and left <HI>Ottley</HI> on the South-&s;ide of the River, a &s;mall Market-town, no otherwi&s;e of Note than
<PB N="115" REF="116">
for its Situation, which is under a large craggy Cliff. If <HI>York&s;hire</HI> owed us any Plea&s;ure for the Fatigues of a former Day, it was abundantly made up to us here; for I cannot but think this one of the mo&s;t delightful Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and I have met with Travellers who have compared it to the Plain of <HI>Palermo</HI> it&s;elf. Nor ought you to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to hear &s;ome Parts of the North compared with <HI>Italy.</HI> The Te&s;timony of Bi&s;hop <HI>Ton&s;tal</HI> is well known, who in his Progre&s;s to <HI>York</HI> with King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the Year 1548, declared, that the Country North of <HI>Donca&s;ter,</HI> and South of <HI>Ha&s;le|wood,</HI> was the riche&s;t he had found in his Travels thro' <HI>Europe.</HI> It would be endle&s;s to mention all the Seats we pa&s;&s;ed; but the Motto, at lea&s;t, of Mr. <HI>Ibbot&s;on</HI>'s at <HI>Denton</HI> will naturally engage the Speculation of every Traveller:
<Q>QVOD NEC IOVIS IRA, NEC IGNIS, NEC POTERIT FERRVM.</Q></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, it &s;eems, belonged once to Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> General of the Parliament Forces, and was about to be demoli&s;hed by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>; but was happily &s;aved by the Sight of a Picture of one of the General's worthy Ance&s;tors. It was afterwards burnt down by Accident, and rebuilt by the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and now, after the Rage of War, and Deva&s;tation of Fire, in a Poetical Rant, defies them both.</P>
<P><HI>Knare&s;borough,</HI> known among Foreigners by the Name of the <HI>York&s;hire Spaw,</HI> &s;tands near <HI>Ripley,</HI> a Market-town, upon the River <HI>Nyd.</HI> In the Town, and the Lands adjacent, are no le&s;s than four differ|ent Mineral Waters. One of the Springs is a pe|trifying Water, which in a little Cave drops from the Roof of the Cavity, and, as they &s;ay, turns Wood into Stone.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">The other two Springs are indeed the mo&s;t valu|able Rarities of the kind in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the <HI>Sweet Spaw,</HI> or a Vitriolick Wa|ter. It was di&s;covered by one Mr. <HI>Sling&s;by, Anno</HI> 1630; and all Phy&s;icians acknowlege it to be a very &s;overeign Medicine in &s;everal particular Di&s;tempers. <HI>See Dr.</HI> Leigh'<HI>s Natural Hi&s;tory of</HI> Lanca&s;hire.</P>
<P>The other is the <HI>Stinking Spaw,</HI> or, according to the Learned, the <HI>Sulphur Well.</HI> This Water is clear as Cry&s;tal, but &s;o fetid and nau&s;eous to the Smell, that many are obliged to hold their No&s;es when they drink it; yet it is a valuable Medicine in Scor|butick, Hypochondriack, and e&s;pecially in Hydropick Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>The People formerly, for many Years, only drank the&s;e Waters, but they now make u&s;e of them as a Cold Bath; and in this manner they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be very good for Rheumatick Pains, Paralytick Numbne&s;&s;es, and many other Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>The&s;e Baths were heretofore well frequented, in|&s;omuch that I have been told 200<HI>l. per Annum</HI> Rent has been given for a Cold Bath. But now <HI>Scar|borough</HI> has the Vogue.</P>
<P>At <HI>Rippon</HI> are two good Stone Bridges, one of which has, I think, thirteen Arches, or more, over the <HI>Eure,</HI> and is a very &s;tately one. There is another over the &s;ame River at <HI>Burrowbrigg,</HI> four Miles lower than <HI>Rippon,</HI> which has indeed but four or five Arches, but then the&s;e Arches are near 40 Feet wide, and one of the middlemo&s;t much more, and are high in proportion; the Ends of the Bridge are likewi&s;e continued by high Cau&s;eways, built of Stone, to keep the Water in its Cour&s;e, which however &s;ometimes overflows them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Bridges, as well as that above-men|tioned at <HI>Harwood,</HI> it may be ob&s;erved, that how|ever low the&s;e Waters are in the Summer, they are high and furious enough in the Winter; and yet the
<PB N="117" REF="118">
River <HI>Aire,</HI> tho' its Source is in the &s;ame Ridge of Mountains as the other, is gentle and mild in its Stream, whereas the others are raging and furious. The only Rea&s;ons I can give for it, are, that this River runs in a thou&s;and Windings and Turnings more than any other in the&s;e Parts, in&s;omuch that, as <HI>Camden</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, near its Head in <HI>Craven</HI> it &s;eems doubtful whether it &s;hould run forward to the Sea, or return to its Spring; and from <HI>Skipton</HI> to <HI>Gargrave</HI> it is ob&s;erved to be pa&s;&s;ed over eight times within the Compa&s;s of three Miles. The next Rea|&s;on is, that after it has de&s;cended from the Moun|tains it has a deeper Chanel.</P>
<P><HI>Rippon,</HI> the <HI>I&s;urium</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> is a very neat, plea&s;ant, well-built Town; and an antient Corpo|ration: it has not only an agreeable Situation on a ri&s;ing Ground between two Rivers, but the Build|ings are good likewi&s;e, particularly the Market-place, which is accounted the fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful Square of its kind in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle of it &s;tands a curious Obeli&s;k, built by Mr. <HI>Ai&s;laby,</HI> who&s;e Seat at <HI>Studley</HI> is about a Mile di&s;tant. The Town is govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen.</P>
<P>Here is a large Collegiate Church, and tho' but a Deanry in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> yet it is a very hand&s;ome, antient, and venerable Pile, and &s;hews it&s;elf a great way in the Country. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Rippon</HI> owes its Greatne&s;s to Religion. And that here was a famous Mona&s;tery built by <HI>Wilfrid,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tia|nity in this I&s;land, is certain; but this pious Gift of the Bi&s;hop was lo&s;t &s;ome Years after; for the <HI>Danes</HI> over-running <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> rifled and burnt it to the Ground, together with the whole Town of <HI>Rippon.</HI> It afterwards flouri&s;hed again as a Mona&s;tery: but that, with the re&s;t, being given up in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Church only was pre&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119">While it was a Mona&s;tery, here was a famous Sanctuary, a Thing much abu&s;ed in foreign Coun|tries. This Privilege was, it &s;eems, granted to the Church of <HI>Rippon</HI> by King <HI>Athel&s;tan,</HI> and whoever broke the Rights of Sanctuary, which he extended a Mile around the Church, were to forfeit Life and E&s;tate; &s;o that, in &s;hort, not the Church only, but the whole Town, and a Circle of two Miles diameter, was a Refuge for all that fled to it, where they lived &s;afe, and out of the Reach of all Law.</P>
<P>Annexed to this Mona&s;tery was an Ho&s;pital, the Purpo&s;es of which are very remarkable, and would be worthy Imitation in our Days of Prote&s;tant Cha|rity. The Hou&s;e was called the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> where, according to the Foundation, were to be maintained two Chaplains, to perform Divine Service; and if any begging Clergyman, or other needy Per&s;on &s;hould happen to travel or &s;tray out of his Way, and call at the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, he &s;hould be relieved there for one Night only, with Food and a Bed, and &s;o be gone in the Morning; and every poor Per&s;on that came craving an Alms on St. <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI>'s Day yearly, &s;hould have one Loaf, Value an Half-peny, (when Corn was at the Price of five Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter) and one Herring.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o recorded, that one Branch of this Ho|&s;pital was given to a Society of religious Si&s;ters to maintain a Chaplain to perform Divine Service; and to keep all the <HI>Lepers</HI> born and bred in <HI>Hip&s;chire</HI>; but the Si&s;ters being in time removed, a Brother|hood was e&s;tabli&s;hed in their &s;tead, which continued for a while; and after that a Ma&s;ter&s;hip. At length all, except the Church, was demoli&s;hed together, and the Hou&s;e with the Mona&s;tery &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Church is an antient <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, firm, &s;trong, and plain; no Imagery or Statues to be &s;een about it; there are three Towers, on which for|merly were Spires.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">The whole Revenues were &s;eized by King <HI>Hen|ry</HI> VIII. &s;o that little or nothing remained for an offi|ciating Clergyman. But King <HI>James</HI> I. having the Ca&s;e repre&s;ented to him by his Queen, was plea&s;ed to found and endow in this Church one Dean, and &s;even Prebendaries, be&s;ides Petit-canons, Singing-men, and Choiri&s;ters, of his own Royal Bounty and Benevolence, under the Juri&s;diction of the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not leave <HI>Rippon</HI> without mentioning St. <HI>Wilfrid's Needle,</HI> a Place famous in antient Times, being a narrow Hole in a clo&s;e vaulted Room under Ground, in which Womens Cha&s;tity was tried; and, if cha&s;te, they pa&s;&s;ed thro', but if otherwi&s;e, the Whim was, they could not. Some <HI>Saxon</HI> Coins were found here in the Year 1695.</P>
<P>In the Church-yard of this Min&s;ter lies a plain Monument, or Grave&s;tone, over the Remains of a generous Soul, who gave Two thou&s;and Pounds to pious U&s;es, and yet has no other Epitaph than the following:
<Q><HI>Hic jacet</HI> Zacharias Jep&s;on, <HI>cujus Aetas fuit</HI> 49.<LB><HI>per paucos annos tantum vixit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We &s;pent a con&s;iderable Part of a Day in the ce|lebrated Park, or rather Garden, belonging to Mr. <HI>Ai&s;labie,</HI> which is vi&s;ited by all the Curious, and ad|mired as a Wonder, not only with regard to the va|rious Beauties, which Nature has &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed; but tho&s;e of Art and Cultivation, wherewith it is &s;o liberally adorned: the latter exhibit a noble Speci|men of that exqui&s;ite fine Ta&s;te for Architecture and Gardening, in which the pre&s;ent worthy Owner is allowed to excel. The Temples and Loggio's, built in many delightful Rece&s;&s;es, may vie with the be&s;t Models of the Antients; and the wide extended Plantations are judiciou&s;ly varied, as the Objects of the Land&s;chape become new. In one Part, the Hills
<PB N="120" REF="121">
gradually a&s;cend, with Tufts of Shade inter&s;pers'd over the Verdure; in another, they precipitately ri&s;e, with Rocks projecting from their rough Sides, and tall Woods covering their Brows. Above the&s;e, a beautiful <HI>Gothick</HI> (but uncon&s;ecrated) Tower lifts up its Head; and below, the Skirts of the Cliffs are watered by a River which wanders in one Place with a &s;ilent Current, and in another falls down in Ca&s;|cades: An ea&s;y Eminence commands a Pro&s;pect of the Town and Min&s;ter of <HI>Rippon,</HI> with a large Ex|tent of Country beyond; and the &s;tately Ruins of <HI>Fountain-Abbey</HI> are &s;een from another, be&s;ides Gen|tlemens Seats in the Centre of many Views. The fine Turf of the Park is con&s;tantly cleared of Weeds, and equal Care is taken to pre&s;erve the be&s;t Trees from Decay: Through the whole Scene of Variety, the Improvements are adapted to follow the luxuriant Fancy of Nature, and humour her different Propen|&s;ities. You &s;ee her deck'd out and inrich'd, where Nece&s;&s;ity or Propriety be&s;peak &s;uch Indulgence; but in the Simplicity of her own Dre&s;s, where Orna|ment would disfigure her beautiful Attire.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e is an old Building, but a noble Plan is laid down for a new one, and in a better Situation of the Park. There are Stables built, which are very grand.</P>
<P>The late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Namur,</HI> (Abbot <HI>Strickland</HI>) when he re&s;ided in <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1734, took a Journey from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Studley,</HI> with Inten|tion to tran&s;plant &s;ome of the Beauties of this Place, as near as might be, in the Di&s;po&s;ition of his Planta|tions, adjoining to a magnificent Palace he was then about to build at his epi&s;copal Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>A Mile from <HI>Rippon,</HI> or le&s;s, is a &s;tately beautiful Seat, called <HI>Newbie,</HI> built &s;ome Years &s;ince by Sir <HI>Edward Blacket.</HI> The Park is extended to the Bank of the River <HI>Eure,</HI> and is &s;ometimes in part laid under Water by the River, which, coming down
<PB N="121" REF="122">
from the We&s;tern Mountains thro' a marly, loamy Soil, fructifies the Earth, they &s;ay, as the River <HI>Nile</HI> does the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Fields about <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI></P>
<P>As Sir <HI>Edward</HI> &s;pared no Co&s;t in the Building, and Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> laid out the De&s;ign, as well as cho&s;e the Situation, I &s;hall only &s;ay, tbat nothing can be added to the one or the other. The Build|ing is of Brick, the Avenues to it are very fine, and the Gardens not only well laid out, but well planted, and as well kept. But for want of fine Gravel, the Walks cannot &s;hew them&s;elves, as they would do, were they in the Southern Part of <HI>England.</HI> The Hou&s;e has a fine Pro&s;pect over the Country, almo&s;t to <HI>York,</HI> with the River in View mo&s;t of the Way; and it has a very noble Appearance to the great North Road, which lies at <HI>Burrow-bridge,</HI> within two Miles of it.</P>
<P>As you begin to come into the <HI>North-riding,</HI> (for the <HI>Eure</HI> parts the <HI>We&s;t-riding</HI> from it) you find your|&s;elf in a Place noted in the North of <HI>England</HI> for the be&s;t and large&s;t Oxen, and the fine&s;t galloping Hor&s;es, bred either for the light Saddle, for the Race, or the Chace, for Running or Hunting. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was a Grazier, and took &s;uch Delight in Breeding and Feeding large Black Cattle, that he had two or three times an Ox out of his Park led about the Country for a Sight, and &s;hewed as far as <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and even to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the bigge&s;t Bul|lock in <HI>England,</HI> and 'twas very &s;eldom, if ever, he was over-match'd.</P>
<P>From the Town of <HI>Rippon</HI> the North Road, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Way al&s;o, which comes from <HI>Ca&s;tleford-bridge,</HI> parting at <HI>Aberforth,</HI> leads away from the Town of <HI>Bedal,</HI> in the <HI>North-riding,</HI> and in a &s;trait Line called <HI>Leeming-Lane,</HI> leaving <HI>Richmond</HI> about two Miles on the We&s;t, goes on to <HI>Piers-bridge,</HI> on the River <HI>Tees,</HI> which are the utmo&s;t Limits of this va&s;t County of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">But as I propo&s;ed at my entering into this <HI>We&s;t-riding</HI> to go no further than <HI>Rippon,</HI> which &s;tands on the Northern Boundary of it, I mu&s;t &s;top here, and likewi&s;e make it the Boundary, as well of this Journey as of this Letter, &s;ince I find it impracti|cable to take a Survey of this large, populous, and wealthy Divi&s;ion on one Journey, without wander|ing to and fro, up and down, backward and forward, on purpo&s;e, which would be exceedingly fatiguing and unea&s;y; and as I was re&s;olved to make as perfect Ob&s;ervations as I po&s;&s;ibly could, of every thing that I could find remarkable in my way, and e&s;pe|cially of the Manufactures of the Country, which I account as well worthy a Traveller's Notice, as the Curio&s;ities and Wonders of Nature, and the mo&s;t refin'd Operations of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, I have therefore concluded upon another Journey into the&s;e Parts, and to enter by the Way of <HI>Lan|ca&s;hire</HI>; and to coa&s;t it along the We&s;t and North-we&s;t Sides of the Country, up to the River <HI>Tees,</HI> and the Southern Side of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham</HI>; and from thence &s;trike down South into the Centre of the County, and &s;o take a Trip Ea&s;t into the Heart of the <HI>North-riding,</HI> to &s;ee the Towns that lie that Way; and then return We&s;t into <HI>York,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing thence South-ea&s;t, take in &s;uch Towns as &s;tand on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>We&s;t-riding,</HI> till I ar|rive at the Fall of the <HI>Trent</HI> into the <HI>Humber</HI>; and cro&s;&s;ing that River, view the Towns in the <HI>Ea&s;t-riding</HI>; and la&s;tly, follow the Sea-coa&s;t all the Way up into <HI>Durham,</HI> which will complete my Tour through the whole County.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ACcording to what I propo&s;ed in my la&s;t, I am now going to enter the <HI>We&s;t-riding</HI> of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> from the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> I mu&s;t pre|mi&s;e to you, that all this Part of the County is &s;o con&s;iderable for its Trade, that the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter General has thought fit to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a Cro&s;s-po&s;t through all the We&s;tern Part of <HI>England</HI> into it, to maintain the Corre&s;pondence of Merchants and Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, of which all this Side of the I&s;land is full. This is a Confirmation of what I have &s;o often repeated, of the Great|ne&s;s of the Trade carried on in this Part of the I&s;land. This Cro&s;s-po&s;t begins at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> in the South-we&s;t Part of <HI>England,</HI> and leaving the great
<PB N="124" REF="125">
We&s;tern Po&s;t-road of <HI>Exce&s;ter</HI> behind, comes away North to <HI>Taunton, Bridgwater,</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; from thence goes on thro' all the great Cities and Towns up the <HI>Severn,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Glouce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Bridge|north,</HI> and <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> thence by <HI>We&s;t Che&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Liverpool</HI> and <HI>Warrington,</HI> from whence it turns away Ea&s;t, and pa&s;&s;es to <HI>Manche&s;ter, Bury, Rochdale, Halifax, Leeds,</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> and ends at <HI>Hull.</HI></P>
<P>By this Means the Merchants at <HI>Hull</HI> have imme|diate Advice of their Ships which go out of the Chanel, and come in, by their Letters from <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> as readily as the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> and without the double Charge of Po&s;tage. The Shop|keepers and Manufacturers can corre&s;pond with their Dealers at <HI>Manche&s;ter, Liverpool,</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> nay, even with <HI>Ireland</HI> directly, without the tedious In|terruption of &s;ending their Letters about by <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I followed this Po&s;t-road from <HI>Liverpool</HI> to <HI>Bury,</HI> both manufacturing Towns in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and the la&s;t very con&s;iderable for a Sort of coar&s;e Goods, called <HI>Half-thicks</HI> and <HI>Ker&s;ies.</HI> The Market for them is very great, tho' the Town is &s;ituated &s;o remote, &s;o out of the way, and at the very Foot of the Mountains, that it would otherwi&s;e be but little frequented.</P>
<P><HI>Rochdale,</HI> farther on in our Way to <HI>Black-&s;tone Edge,</HI> is a good Market-town, and is of late very much improved in the Woollen Manufacture, as are al&s;o the Villages in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Here, for our great Encouragement, tho' it was but about the Middle of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and in &s;ome Places the Harve&s;t hardly got in, we &s;aw the Mountains covered with Snow, and felt the Cold very acute and piercing; but we found, as in all tho&s;e Northern Countries, the People had a happy Way of mixing the Warm and the Cold together; for the Store of good Ale, which flows plentifully in the mo&s;t moun|tainous Part of this Country, &s;eems abundantly to
<PB N="125" REF="126">
make up for all the Inclemencies of the Sea&s;on, or Difficulties of Travelling, adding al&s;o the Plenty of Coals for Firing, of which all tho&s;e Hills are full.</P>
<P>We mounted the Hills, fortified with a little of this Precaution, early in the Morning; and tho' the Snow, which had fallen in the Night, lay a little upon the Ground, yet we thought it was not much; and the Morning being calm and clear, we had no Apprehen&s;ion of an unea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age, neither did the People at <HI>Rochdale,</HI> who kindly directed us the Way, and even offered to guide us over the fir&s;t Mountains, apprehend any Difficulty for us; &s;o we complimented our&s;elves out of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which we afterwards very much wanted.</P>
<P>For tho' the Sun &s;hone when we came out of the Town of <HI>Rochdale,</HI> yet when we began to mount the Hills about a Mile from it, we found the Wind ri&s;e, and the higher we went, the more it increa&s;ed upon us; by which I &s;oon perceived, that it had blown before, and perhaps all Night, upon the Hills, though it was calm below. And &s;o we were obliged, in a mo&s;t di&s;couraging manner, to travel thro' track|le&s;s Drifts of Snow, and it continuing &s;nowing too in our Faces, over <HI>Black&s;tone Edge,</HI> we knew not whether we were wrong or right, till we perceived &s;ome Land-marks, that the hone&s;t <HI>Rochdale</HI> Men had told us of, which gave us great Comfort.</P>
<P>But after we had pa&s;&s;ed this di&s;mal <HI>Edge,</HI> it was our con&s;tant Labour, as &s;oon as we were at the Top of a Hill, to come down it again on the other Side, and then another Hill aro&s;e. I do not re|member, that there was one Bottom, that had any con&s;iderable Breadth of plain Ground in it, but al|ways a Brook in the Valley running from tho&s;e Gulls and Deeps between the Hills; and it was ob|&s;ervable, that they always cro&s;s'd our Way in the Bottoms from the Right-hand to the Left, the Rea|&s;on of which you &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">From <HI>Black&s;tone Edge</HI> to <HI>Halifax</HI> is eight Miles, and all the Way, except from <HI>Sorby</HI> to <HI>Halifax,</HI> is thus up Hill and down; &s;o that, I &s;uppo&s;e, we mounted to the Clouds, and de&s;cended to the Water-level, about eight times, in that little Part of the Journey.</P>
<P>But now I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that after we had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd Hill, and come down into the Valley again, and &s;o &s;till the nearer we came to <HI>Halifax,</HI> we found the Hou&s;es thicker, and the Vil|lages greater, in every Bottom; and not only &s;o, but the Sides of the Hills, which were very &s;teep every way, were &s;pread with Hou&s;es; for the Land being divided into &s;mall Inclo&s;ures, from two Acres to &s;ix or &s;even each, &s;eldom more, every three or four Pieces of Land had a Hou&s;e belonging to them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, after we had mounted the third Hill, we found the Country one continued Village, tho' every way mountainous, hardly a Hou&s;e &s;tanding out of a Speaking-di&s;tance from another; and as the Day cleared up, we could &s;ee at every Hou&s;e a Tenter, and on almo&s;t every Tenter a Piece of Cloth, Ker&s;ie, or Shalloon, which are the three Articles of this Country's Labour.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of our Road among the Hou&s;es, we found at every one of them a little Rill or Gut|ter of running Water; if the Hou&s;e was above the Road, it came from it, and cro&s;&s;ed the Way to run to another; if the Hou&s;e was below us, it cro&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from &s;ome other di&s;tant Hou&s;e above it; and at every con&s;iderable Hou&s;e was a Manufactory, which not being able to be carried on without Water, the&s;e little Streams were &s;o parted and guided by Gutters or Pipes, that not one of the Hou&s;es wanted its ne|ce&s;&s;ary Appendage of a Rivulet.</P>
<P>Again, as the Dying-hou&s;es, Scouring-&s;hops, and Places where they u&s;e this Water, emit it ting'd with the Drugs of the Dying-vat, and with the Oil, the
<PB N="127" REF="128">
Soap, the Tallow, and other Ingredients u&s;ed by the Clothiers in Dre&s;&s;ing and Scouring, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Lands thro' which it pa&s;&s;es, which otherwi&s;e would be ex|ceeding barren, are enrich'd by it to a Degree beyond Imagination.</P>
<P>Then, as every Clothier mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily keep one Hor&s;e, at lea&s;t, to fetch home his Wooll and his Provi&s;ions from the Market, to carry his Yarn to the Spinners, his Manufacture to the Fulling-mill, and, when fini&s;hed, to the Market to be &s;old, and the like; &s;o every one generally keeps a Cow or two for his Family. By this means, the &s;mall Pieces of inclo&s;ed Land about each Hou&s;e are oc|cupied; and by being thus fed, are &s;till farther im|proved from the Dung of the Cattle. As for Corn, they &s;carce &s;ow enough to feed their Cocks and Hens.</P>
<P>Such, it &s;eems, has been the Bounty of Nature to this Country, that two Things e&s;&s;ential to Life, and more particularly to the Bu&s;ine&s;s followed here, are found in it, and in &s;uch a Situation, as is not to be met with in any Part of <HI>England,</HI> if in the World be&s;ide: I mean, Coals and running Water on the Tops of the highe&s;t Hills. I doubt not but there are both Springs and Coals lower in the&s;e Hills; but were they to fetch them thence, 'tis probable the Pits would be too full of Water: 'tis ea&s;y, however, to fetch them from the upper Pits, the Hor&s;es going light up, and coming down loaden. This Place then &s;eems to have been de&s;igned by Providence for the very Purpo&s;es to which it is now allotted, for carrying on a Manufacture, which can no-where be &s;o ea&s;ily &s;upplied with the Conveniencies nece&s;&s;ary for it. Nor is the Indu&s;try of the People wanting to &s;econd the&s;e Advantages. Tho' we met few People without Doors, yet within we &s;aw the Hou&s;es full of lu&s;ty Fellows, &s;ome at the Dye-vat, &s;ome at the Loom, others dre&s;&s;ing the Cloths; the
<PB N="128" REF="129">
Women and Children carding, or &s;pinning; all imployed from the younge&s;t to the olde&s;t, &s;carce any thing above four Years old, but its Hands were &s;ufficient for its own Support. Not a Beggar to be &s;een, not an idle Per&s;on, except here and there in an Alms-hou&s;e, built for tho&s;e that are antient and pa&s;t working. The People in general live long; they enjoy a good Air, and under &s;uch Circum&s;tances hard Labour is naturally attended with the Ble&s;&s;ing of Health, if not Riches.</P>
<P>From this Account, you'll ea&s;ily imagine, that &s;ome of the&s;e remote Parts of the North are the mo&s;t populous Places of <HI>Great Britain, London</HI> and its Neighbourhood excepted.</P>
<P>We have all this while been in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Hali|fax,</HI> and before I come to the Town, I mu&s;t add a Word or two of the River <HI>Calder,</HI> to complete the De&s;cription of the Country I pa&s;&s;ed through. As I &s;aid before, that all the Rills of Water which we cro&s;&s;ed, one at lea&s;t in every Bottom, went away to the Left or North Side of us, as we went Ea&s;tward, I am to add, that following tho&s;e little Brooks with our Eye, we could ob&s;erve, that at &s;ome Di&s;tance to the Left there appeared a larger Valley than the re&s;t, into which not only all the Brooks which we pa&s;&s;ed emptied them&s;elves, but abundance more from the hollow deep Bottoms among the Hills on the North-&s;ide beyond it, which emptied this way South, as tho&s;e on our Side run that way North. And at the next Village, called <HI>Sorby,</HI> or <HI>Sowerby,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable River (form'd from tho&s;e Brooks, and the melted Snows) over a &s;tately Stone Bridge of &s;everal great Arches. And this was the main River <HI>Calder,</HI> which I mentioned at <HI>Wakefield,</HI> where it begins to be navigable, and which, without any Spring, may be called the Head of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation will hold on mo&s;t of the great Rivers in the North; there being hardly any
<PB N="129" REF="130">
that have their Beginning in any publick Springs or Lakes, as the Rivers in the South of <HI>England</HI> gene|rally have; which is the Ca&s;e particularly of the <HI>Derwent</HI> and the <HI>Don</HI> from the <HI>High Peak,</HI> and the Hills of the &s;ame Range more South of the <HI>Edge</HI>; of the <HI>Aire,</HI> the <HI>Wherfe,</HI> the <HI>Swale,</HI> the <HI>Eure,</HI> the <HI>Nyd,</HI> the <HI>Tees,</HI> and the <HI>Were,</HI> all in the &s;ame County of <HI>York</HI>; and the <HI>Tyne,</HI> the <HI>Cockett,</HI> the <HI>Till,</HI> and the <HI>Tweed,</HI> farther North; and even the <HI>Forth,</HI> the <HI>Tay,</HI> the <HI>Clyde,</HI> the <HI>Nyd,</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and the <HI>Mer&s;ee,</HI> the <HI>Ribble,</HI> the <HI>Rocke,</HI> and the <HI>Lune,</HI> the We&s;t <HI>Calder,</HI> the <HI>Lowther,</HI> and the <HI>Eden,</HI> on the other Side of the&s;e Mountains, in <HI>Lanca&s;hire, We&s;t|morland,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus accounted for them all at once, I &s;hall only mention them now as they come in my way; for you will ob&s;erve, I cro&s;&s;ed one or other of them at every con&s;iderable Town, all the Rivers as well in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> North of this Place, running from the middle of the Country where the&s;e Mountains ri&s;e, either Ea&s;t into the <HI>German,</HI> or We&s;t into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea. None of them run like the <HI>Severn,</HI> or the <HI>Wye,</HI> or the Rivers in South <HI>Wales,</HI> or the <HI>Exe</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> or the <HI>Avon</HI> in <HI>Wilts,</HI> or the <HI>Arun</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and others North and South. But I return to my Journey.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Calder</HI> at <HI>Sorby Bridge,</HI> I now came to the Town of <HI>Halifax,</HI> the mo&s;t populous Pari&s;h or Vicarage in <HI>England</HI>; for it is but one, though 12 Miles in Diameter; but it has 12 or 13 Chapels of Ea&s;e, be&s;ides about 16 Meeting-hou&s;es, which they call al&s;o Chapels, being conformable in Fa&s;hion to them, having Bells and Burying-ground to mo&s;t of them, not reckoning tho&s;e of the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> into the Number.</P>
<P>In the Year 1443, there were but 30 Hou&s;es in it; but in the next Century it was much increa&s;ed: for Hi&s;tory tells us, that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> being
<PB N="130" REF="131">
petition'd by the Inhabitants of <HI>Halifax,</HI> to grant them &s;ome Privileges, they &s;et forth, as an In&s;tance of their Loyalty, that no le&s;s than 12000 young Men went out armed from this one Pari&s;h, and, at her Maje&s;ty's Call, joined her Troops to fight the Popi&s;h Army, then in Rebellion under the Earl of <HI>We&s;tmorland.</HI></P>
<P>If they then were &s;o populous, what mu&s;t they be now their Trade is &s;o va&s;tly inlarged by the great Demand of Ker&s;eys for cloathing the Armies abroad? Some maintain, that it is increa&s;ed a fourth at lea&s;t within the&s;e 50 Years; from their having entred upon a Manufacture of Shalloons, which were never made in the&s;e Parts before, at lea&s;t, not in any Quantities; and 'tis computed, that 100,000 Pieces are work'd up in this Pari&s;h only; and yet they do not make much fewer Ker&s;eys than they did before; for I was a&s;&s;ured, that there was one Dealer in the Vicarage, who traded, by Commi&s;&s;ion, for 60000<HI>l.</HI> a Year in Ker&s;eys only, to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> And of late Years it is &s;till more increa&s;ed, by the People of a neighbouring Part driving away about 4000 <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Manufacturers, who with about 2000 others accompanying them, &s;ettled there. As the Vicarage is thus far extended, and &s;o populous, what mu&s;t the Market be which &s;upplies this va&s;t Num|ber of Inhabitants? And yet the&s;e are all brought from other Parts of the Country. For as to Corn, they &s;ow little, and they feed very few Oxen or Sheep; and as they are &s;urrounded with large ma|nufacturing Towns on every Side, all of them im|ployed, like them&s;elves, in the Clothing Trade, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have their Provi&s;ions from other more di&s;tant Parts.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence then is plain; their Corn comes up in great Quantities out of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and <HI>Notting|ham&s;hire,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-riding</HI>; the Black Cattle from thence, and from <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI>; Sheep and
<PB N="131" REF="132">
Mutton from the adjacent Counties every way; Butter from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>North-ridings</HI>; and Chee&s;e out of <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The Markets in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October</HI> are prodigiou&s;ly thronged, that being the Time when the Clothiers buy up as many Oxen as will &s;erve their Family for the whole Year, which they u&s;ed to drive Home, kill, &s;alt, and hang up in the Smoke to dry. This was heretofore their common Diet, but now they live more upon fre&s;h Meats.</P>
<P>Thus one trading manufacturing Part of the Coun|try in a barren Soil, gives and receives Support from all the Countries round it.</P>
<P>There is nothing extraordinary in the Town it&s;elf; but the Multitude of People who re&s;ort to it on a Market-day, as well to &s;ell their Manufactures, as to buy Provi&s;ions, is prodigious: in this re&s;pect no Places equal it in all the North Part of <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>Leeds</HI> and <HI>Wakefield.</HI></P>
<P>The Church is old, but &s;tately and venerable, and has in it many extraordinary Monuments, but mo&s;t of them of great Antiquity. Here is a very good Ho&s;pital, and a Work-hou&s;e of an antient E&s;tabli&s;h|ment; and there are &s;everal Charities of like Sort, in different Parts of the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Halifax</HI> gave Birth to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Halifax,</HI> or <HI>de Sacro Bo&s;co,</HI> the chief Mathematician of his Age, who was buried at the publick Expence of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris</HI>; and to the late Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> the Mo|del of true rational Preaching; tho' a new Sect, lately &s;prung up, called <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> with great Pre|tences to <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> and intolerable <HI>Conceit</HI> and <HI>Va|nity,</HI> at pre&s;ent &s;eek publickly to depreciate the Memory and Works of that truly great Man.</P>
<P>The Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice antiently made u&s;e of here to prevent the &s;tealing of Cloth, is very remarkable. Modern Authors pretend to &s;ay it was for all Sorts
<PB N="132" REF="133">
of Felons; but I am well a&s;&s;ured, it was fir&s;t erected purely, or at lea&s;t principally, for &s;uch Thieves as were detected in &s;tealing Cloth from the Tenters: and it &s;eems very rea&s;onable to think it was &s;o, be|cau&s;e of the Conditions of the Trial. The following is a brief Account of it:</P>
<P>The Woollen Manufacture was erected here about the Year 1480, when King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. cau&s;ed an Act to pa&s;s prohibiting the Exportation of unwrought Wooll, and to encourage foreign Manufacturers to &s;ettle in <HI>England</HI>; &s;everal of whom coming over, e&s;tabli&s;hed different Manufactures of Cloths in dif|ferent Parts of the Kingdom, as that of Bays at <HI>Colche&s;ter.</HI> Says at <HI>Sudbury,</HI> Broad-cloth in <HI>Wilts,</HI> and other Counties; and the Trade of Ker&s;eys and narrow Cloth at this Place, and other adjacent Towns. And as, at the Time when this Trade began, nothing was more frequent than for young Workmen to leave their Cloths out all Night upon Tenters, which gave an Opportunity for the idle Fellows to &s;teal them, a &s;evere Law was made again&s;t &s;tealing Cloth, which gave the Power of Life and Death into the Hands of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Halifax.</HI> But this Law was extended to no other Crime; and the Con|ditions of it, as I have &s;aid, intimate as much: for the Power was not given to the Magi&s;trates to give Sen|tence, unle&s;s in one of the&s;e three plain Ca&s;es:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Hand Napping,</HI> that is, when the Criminal was taken in the very Fact.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Back Bearing,</HI> that is, when the Cloth was found upon him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Tongue Confe&s;&s;ing,</HI> which needs no Explanation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Fact likewi&s;e was to be committed within the Liberties or Precincts of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Hard|wick</HI>; and the Value of the Goods &s;tolen was to be above thirteen Pence Halfpeny.</P>
<P>When the Criminal was taken, he was brought before the Magi&s;trates of the Town, and they judged,
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;entenced, and executed the Offender, or cleared him, within &s;o many Days; I think it was three Market Days. If the Offence was committed out of the Vicarage, but within the Bounds of the Fore&s;t, then there were <HI>Frith Bourgers</HI> al&s;o to judge of the Fact, who were to be &s;ummoned out of the <HI>Fore&s;t Holders,</HI> as they are called, who were to hold of that Frith, that is, of the Fore&s;t. If they acquitted him of the Fact, he was immediately di&s;charged; if they condemned him, nobody could reprieve him but the Town. The Country People were, it &s;eems, &s;o terrified at the Severity of this Proceeding, that hence came that Proverbial Litany, which was u&s;ed all over <HI>York&s;hire:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>From</HI> Hell, Hull, <HI>and</HI> Halifax,</L>
<L><HI>Good Lord, deliver us.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Hull</HI> was included in this Petition, on account of their rigid Di&s;cipline to Beggars; for they whipt out the foreign Poor, and &s;et their own to work.</P>
<P>The Manner of Execution was very remarkable, by an Ax drawn up by a Pulley, and fa&s;tened with a Pin to the Side of a Wooden Engine, which when pulled out, the Axe fell &s;wiftly down, and did its Office.</P>
<P>The Engine is now gone, but the Ba&s;is on which it &s;tood &s;till remains, being a &s;quare Foundation of Stone, to which you go up by Steps. The Engine was removed, as we were told, in the Year 1620, during the Reign of K. <HI>James</HI> I.</P>
<P>In the Reign of the &s;ame Prince, the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> Regent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>Halifax,</HI> and &s;eeing one of the&s;e Executions, cau&s;ed a Model to be taken, and carried into his own Country, where it is made u&s;e of at this Day. But his Lord|&s;hip's own Head was the fir&s;t that was cut off with it; and it being many Years before that happened, the
<PB N="134" REF="135">
Engine got the Name of the <HI>Maiden,</HI> before it was hand&s;elled by the Execution of the Earl; and this it retains, tho' it has cut off many a Head &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Ways to <HI>Halifax</HI> u&s;ed to be exceedingly bad, and, except at the We&s;t Entrance, almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; but of late Years they have been much mended; and &s;everal Acts of Parliament have pa&s;&s;ed very lately, which will greatly increa&s;e the Conveniences of the People thereabouts, as well as improve its Commerce and Communication all around it, to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> as well as to <HI>Leeds, Donca&s;ter,</HI> and all the great trading Towns, even to the City of <HI>York</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Due Ea&s;t from <HI>Halifax,</HI> is <HI>Kirkley,</HI> a &s;mall Vil|lage, &s;ituated on the <HI>Calder,</HI> near which is the Mo|nument of the famous <HI>Robin Hood</HI>; and upon the Moor, his <HI>Butts,</HI> Two little Hills, &s;o called, about a Quarter of a Mile a&s;under. I have now traced this Hero from the Fore&s;t of <HI>Shirwood,</HI> the Scene of his Exploits, to his Grave. I before doubted whe|ther there ever was &s;uch an one; but Epitaphs, as great Liars as they are, I &s;uppo&s;e, are Evidence that &s;uch a Man once exi&s;ted. His is as follows:
<Q><L><HI>Here undernead di&s;laid Stean</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lais</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Huntingtun.</L>
<L><HI>Nea areir ver az hie &s;a geud,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Lick Utlawz hi an is Men</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vil</HI> England <HI>niver &s;ee agen.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Near this Place is a little Town, called <HI>Bur&s;tall,</HI> where they make Broad Cloth, &s;o called in Di&s;tinction from Ker&s;eys and Druggets, and the like, tho' the Cloths in this Country are called Narrow, when they are &s;poken of in <HI>London,</HI> and compared with the Broad Cloths made in <HI>Wilts, Glouce&s;ter, Somer&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is famed for Dying, and there are made here a &s;ort of Cloth in Imitation of <HI>Glouce&s;ter Whites,</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="136">
which, tho' they may not be &s;o fine, yet their Co|lours are as good.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Leeds,</HI> and every way round, the Country appears exceedingly bu&s;y and diligent. The Hou&s;es are not &s;catter'd and di&s;per&s;ed, as in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Halifax,</HI> but crouded up in large Villages, and thronged with People.</P>
<P>A few Miles South-we&s;t of <HI>Halifax</HI> is <HI>Huthersfield,</HI> upon the <HI>Calder,</HI> which is the fir&s;t noted Town it comes to. This Town is one of the Five, where that va&s;t Clothing-trade, which I have already men|tioned, is carried on. They have a Market here for Ker&s;eys every <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI></P>
<P>While I am &s;peaking of their Manufactures, I mu&s;t not forget that very e&s;&s;ential one, called <HI>York|&s;hire Ale,</HI> which indeed is in its Perfection in all this Part of the County. But I cannot pa&s;s over <HI>Hu|thersfield</HI> without taking notice of its old Neighbour, <HI>Almondbury,</HI> a famous Town in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and called <HI>Campodunum</HI>; but 'tis now a Village only. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls it a Royal Town; and &s;ays, it had a Cathedral Church in it, dedicated to St. <HI>Alban,</HI> from whom it was called <HI>Albanbury,</HI> whence its pre&s;ent Name. The Ruins of a Stone Ca&s;tle and Rampire are &s;till to be &s;een near it.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Calder</HI> having been made navigable to <HI>Wakefield,</HI> and great Benefit ari&s;ing from it, it is now [<HI>Ann.</HI> 1741.] about to be made further navigable, to the Towns of <HI>Ealand</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI>; which will be of inexpre&s;&s;ible Service to tho&s;e populous and improving Places, and all the Villages and Towns adjacent. And as there have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed new Acts to mend the Road from <HI>Selby</HI> to <HI>Leeds, Bradford,</HI> and <HI>Halifax,</HI> and from <HI>Ealand</HI> to <HI>Leeds,</HI> which have been torn in Pieces by the heavy Carriages pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the carrying on the va&s;t extended Trade of tho&s;e Parts; 'tis hardly to be conceived what Benefit will accrue from the&s;e publick Works.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">The fir&s;t Town we came to from <HI>Halifax,</HI> was <HI>Bradford.</HI> It has a Market; but is of no other Note than having given Birth to Dr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> the good Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;oon enter'd <HI>Craven,</HI> which is a very hilly and craggy Country, as the Name &s;ignifies; for <HI>Craven</HI> comes from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Craig,</HI> a Rock. But, however unplea&s;ant,</P>
<P>We proceeded farther North-we&s;t, and arrived at <HI>Skipton,</HI> a good well-built Town, encompa&s;&s;ed with Hills on every Side. The Market is well frequented and &s;upplied. Here is a large hand&s;ome Church, and a good Grammar School; to which one Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> who had been principal of <HI>Bernard</HI>'s-<HI>Inn, London,</HI> gave a con&s;iderable Parcel of Books, and like|wi&s;e erected a good Library in the Church. We were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;o hand&s;ome a Town, and &s;uch good Accommodations in &s;o mountainous a Country.</P>
<P>This is a healthy Country however, and the In|habitants live to a great Age: a Father and Son giving Evidence at the A&s;&s;izes at <HI>York,</HI> it appeared the fir&s;t was 140, and the Son 100 Years old.</P>
<P>Here the Road turns almo&s;t due We&s;t, which brought us to a Town called <HI>Settle,</HI> a much better Town than we expected in &s;uch a Country. It lies on the Road to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> at the Foot of the Moun|tains which part that County from <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> upon the River <HI>Ribble.</HI></P>
<P>And a little lower, upon the &s;ame River, upon the Borders of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> &s;tands <HI>Gi&s;borne,</HI> but has nothing remarkable in it.</P>
<P>Looking forwards, to the North-we&s;t of us, we &s;aw nothing but high Mountains, which had a terrible A&s;pect, and more frightful than any in <HI>Monmouth|&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Pingent Hill,</HI> which <HI>Camden</HI> derives from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Pengwin,</HI> i. e. <HI>White-head,</HI> from the Snow lying upon it: &s;o

that having no manner of Inclination to encounter them, merely for the &s;ake of &s;eeing only a few Vil|lages, and a Parcel of wild People, we turned &s;hort North-ea&s;t, and came to the great Road leading Northward to <HI>Richmond,</HI> at a Village called <HI>Brum|&s;tal,</HI> noted for the Birth of Sir <HI>William Craven,</HI> an Alderman of <HI>London,</HI> who was a great Founder and Builder of Churches, Bridges, Cau&s;ways, and other publick Edifices in this Country.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed thro' &s;ome other incon&s;iderable Vil|lages, we enter'd <HI>Midlam,</HI> a little Market-town on the River <HI>Youre,</HI> and the North-riding of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> together, and &s;o leaving <HI>Ma&s;ham,</HI> another incon&s;i|derable Market-town, which lay upon the &s;ame River, to the South-ea&s;t of us, we pa&s;&s;ed along to <HI>Bedal,</HI> which is likewi&s;e of no great Note, &s;aving that the Living is worth 500<HI>l.</HI> a Year, and that we met here again the <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;way, which leads up through <HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>Barnards Ca&s;tle,</HI> in the Bi&s;hop|rick of <HI>Durham,</HI> and is called <HI>Leeming-lane</HI> for 20 Miles together. We put our&s;elves upon this Way, and were not long before we arrived at <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I met with nothing el&s;e within the Town of <HI>Bedal</HI> worth ob&s;erving, yet the Country round it, as indeed the whole County, is more or le&s;s full of Jockies, and Dealers in Hor&s;es; and the Breed in this, and the next County, is &s;o well known, that tho' the Pedigree of them is not pre&s;erved for a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Ages, as 'tis &s;aid they do in <HI>Arabia,</HI> yet are their Stallions denominated by certain Names, that never fail to advance the Price of a Hor&s;e accord|ing to the Reputation of the Sire he comes of.</P>
<P>And indeed, let Foreigners boa&s;t what they will of <HI>Barbs</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;es, or of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Jennets from <HI>Cordoua,</HI> for which 500<HI>l.</HI> apiece have been given, I believe that &s;ome of the Gallopers of this County, and of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> which joins to it, will out-do, for Speed and Strength, the &s;wifte&s;t Hor&s;e
<PB N="138" REF="139">
that was ever bred in <HI>Turkey</HI> or <HI>Barbary,</HI> take both Advantages together. For tho' the <HI>Barb</HI> may beat <HI>York&s;hire</HI> for a Mile Cour&s;e, <HI>York&s;hire</HI> &s;hall di&s;tance him at the End of the Four Miles; the <HI>Barb</HI> &s;hall carry the Day with Seven and a half, but <HI>York&s;hire</HI> with 12 and 14 Stone. In a word, <HI>York&s;hire</HI> &s;hall carry the Man, and the <HI>Barb</HI> a Feather. But they are univer&s;ally allowed to be the be&s;t Hunting and Road Hor&s;es in the World; and are bought up by Foreigners on that Account.</P>
<P>As this Part of the Country is &s;o much imployed in Hor&s;es, the young Fellows are bred up in the Sta|ble, and make excellent Grooms.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their Fame for Hor&s;es, they have the Re|putation al&s;o of being good Grafiers over this whole Country, and produce a large, noble Breed of Oxen, as may be &s;een at <HI>North Allerton</HI> Fairs, where in|credible Numbers of them are bought Eight times every Year, and brought Southward as far as the Fens in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and the <HI>I&s;le of Ely,</HI> where they are fed up to the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of Fat we &s;ee in <HI>London</HI> Markets. The Market the&s;e North Country Cattle are generally brought to, is at <HI>St. Ives,</HI> a Town be|tween <HI>Huntingdon</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> upon the River <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Richmond</HI> is &s;o called from its Situation upon a Hill or Mount, fruitful, tho' the Country about it is rocky and barren; and it gives the Name of <HI>Richmond&s;hire</HI> to the Di&s;trict it is in, as another, Ea&s;t of this, is called <HI>Allerton&s;hire:</HI> the former is in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and the latter in that of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>This Town, in the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> II. was annexed to the Duchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o &s;till con|tinues. Earl <HI>Edwin</HI> built a Ca&s;tle here, the Tower o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is &s;till &s;tanding; as is al&s;o the Steeple of the old Priory. It is a Borough governed by a Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and holds Pleas in all kinds of Action; has a good Market-place, and Three Gates, which lead to
<PB N="139" REF="140">
Three different Suburbs. It is well built all of Stone, and &s;ome Hou&s;es of Free-&s;tone.</P>
<P>We were told, That in the Year 1732, Mr. <HI>Whar|ton</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> Agent to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> by ordering &s;everal Places here to be dug very deep, di&s;covered the Draw-bridge and Moat be|longing to <HI>Richmond</HI> Ca&s;tle, which were of very curious Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>Here thrives a kind of Manufactory of knit Yarn Stockens for Servants, and ordinary People. Every Family is imployed that way, both great and &s;mall; and here you may buy the &s;malle&s;t &s;ized Stockens for Children for 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> the Dozen Pair, &s;ometimes le&s;s.</P>
<P>This Trade extends it&s;elf al&s;o into <HI>We&s;tmorland,</HI> or rather from <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> hither: for at <HI>Kendal, Kirkby-Stephen,</HI> and &s;uch other Places in this County as border upon <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> the chief Manufacture of Yarn Stockens is carried on, which is indeed a very con&s;iderable one, and of late greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>We made &s;ome Excur&s;ions from this Town into the Country round it, and followed the River <HI>Swal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> We&s;t, which runs under the Wall of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and, by rea&s;on of Rocks, which intercept its Pa&s;&s;age, forms here a natural Cataract. This River, tho' not extraordinary large, is noted for giving Name to the Lands which it runs through for &s;ome Length, called <HI>Swale Dale,</HI> and to an antient Family of that Name; the la&s;t of whom was Sir <HI>Solomon Swale,</HI> Bart. who wrote him&s;elf of <HI>Swale Hall,</HI> in <HI>Swale Dale,</HI> by the River <HI>Swale.</HI> This Gentleman became unfortunate, and was &s;upplanted by a Per&s;on not long &s;ince dead, who was a Clerk in the Exchequer Office; and ob&s;erving this Family held their E&s;tate of the Crown, and that they had omitted to renew for many Years, procured a Grant from the Crown, of this E&s;tate for him&s;elf. A great many Law-&s;uits en&s;ued; but to no other Effect
<PB N="140" REF="141">
than to increa&s;e the Misfortunes of this Gentleman, who died a Pri&s;oner in the Fleet, but, I think, not till his Adver&s;ary had fir&s;t made away with him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Swale Dale</HI> is a low, plea&s;ant, and rich Valley, abounding with Gra&s;s, but very bare of Wood; tho' here is a Place ju&s;t by, called <HI>Swale Dale Fore&s;t:</HI> it might have been &s;o antiently, but there are hardly Trees enough in it now to denominate it a Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ar from this Fore&s;t lies <HI>Wen&s;dale,</HI> a very rich and fruitful Valley, well covered with delicate green Gra&s;s, and &s;tocked with va&s;t Herds of Cattle; and, in &s;ome Places, produces Lead Ore. The <HI>Eure</HI> runs thro' the Mid&s;t of it, and ri&s;es in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> We&s;tern Mountains, very near the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rce of the <HI>Swale,</HI> which, as it were, leaps into it from a Precipice at <HI>Myton.</HI> Both the&s;e Rivers are plentifully &s;tocked with Fi&s;h, and <HI>Eure</HI> has Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;h in it.</P>
<P>But let me &s;top in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, to take Notice of one of the greate&s;t Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">es that <HI>England</HI> ever pro|duced; I mean <HI>Henry Jenkins,</HI> who&s;e remarkable great Age de&s;erves our particular Notice: He was born in the Year 1500, and died in 1670, being then 169 Years of Age. There are no Regi&s;ters of &s;o long a Date, and therefore his Age mu&s;t be gue&s;&s;ed at by other Circum&s;tances, either from his own Account, or the probable Evidences of others. Which are the&s;e:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Being demanded by a Gentlewoman, who was curious to know, as exactly as po&s;&s;ible how old he was, What Kings he remembred; he an&s;wered, after a little Pau&s;e,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he thought him&s;elf about 162 or 163 Years old; and that he could remem|ber <HI>Plowden</HI> (meaning <HI>Floddon</HI>) <HI>Field,</HI> fought again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s Reign."</Q>
She then a&s;k'd him:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Was the King him&s;elf there?"</Q>
He replied,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No; he was in <HI>France,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Surrey</HI> was General."</Q>
She a&s;ked him then, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How old he was then?"</Q> He &s;aid,
<PB N="141" REF="142">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"About 12 Years old."</Q> That Battle was fought <HI>September</HI> 9. 1513; King <HI>Henry</HI> being then at <HI>Tournay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There were Four or Five of the &s;ame Pari&s;h, at that time, of an 100 Years old or very near it, who all declared, That they never knew him any other than an elderly Man; and that he told them he was Butler to the Lord <HI>Coniers.</HI> The la&s;t of that Name died without I&s;&s;ue 3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4 <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> I. <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1557. And he remembred the Ab|bot of <HI>Fountains,</HI> before the Di&s;&s;olution in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s Time.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> He went often to the A&s;&s;izes on Foot; and was u&s;ed as a Witne&s;s in other Courts, who&s;e Records &s;peak largely of his Age. In the <HI>Chancery</HI> he was &s;worn, to the Remembrance of above 140 Years; and as much, often, at <HI>York</HI> A&s;&s;izes. In the King's <HI>Remembrancer's Office</HI> in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> a Record &s;aith,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That <HI>Henry Jenkins,</HI> Labourer, aged 157 Years, depo&s;ed, as a Witne&s;s, in 1665; and, to confirm his Age, divers antient Men, who were Witne&s;&s;es, &s;wore that he was a very old Man when they fir&s;t knew him."</Q></P>
<P>He was, for the la&s;t Century of his Life, a Fi&s;her|man, and u&s;ed to wade and &s;wim in the Rivers even after he was an hundred Years old, and lived upon very coar&s;e Diet. In &s;ome of his la&s;t Years, being unable to work at his Trade, he went a begging to Gentlemens Hou&s;es, who u&s;ed to relieve him chear|fully, as a great Curio&s;ity. And his great Age was the more to be credited, becau&s;e he could neither write nor read: and &s;o, what he reported, was from Strength of Memory Two Years before his Death, he was able to bind Sheaves after the Reapers, and had his Sight and Hearing to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The next Excur&s;ion we made was up to the Banks of the <HI>Tees,</HI> thro' <HI>Gilling, Eggle&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>Bowes,</HI> now ordinary Towns, or rather Villages; tho' the
<PB N="142" REF="143">
fir&s;t had, formerly, a great Ca&s;tle; which, in the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s Time, and long afterwards, was the Seat of the Lords of that Country; whereas <HI>Rich|mond,</HI> which has &s;ince ro&s;e out of the Ruins of <HI>Gil|ling,</HI> was but a Fort, and in Subordination to it.</P>
<P><HI>Eggle&s;ton</HI> is famous for Marble, which they dig out of the Rocks there, and imploys a great many Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Bowes</HI> &s;tands upon the Military <HI>Roman</HI> Way, and has been therefore, undoubtedly, a Place of great Note.</P>
<P>In this Part of <HI>Richmond&s;hire,</HI> and up Northward, are no le&s;s than Three Fore&s;ts, viz. <HI>Applegarth</HI> Fore&s;t, <HI>New</HI> Fore&s;t, and <HI>Lune</HI> Fore&s;t; and all the&s;e within a Tract of Ground of no great Extent. Not far off is, be&s;ides, the Fore&s;t of <HI>Swale Dale,</HI> before-mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tees</HI> is famous for Salmon, and is a rapid River, and &s;ometimes &s;wells up &s;o &s;uddenly, that a Man, in pa&s;&s;ing the Ford, in the Road to <HI>Darlington,</HI> on Foot, whil&s;t the Water was low, and hardly up to his Knees, was overtaken, as he was going over, by a &s;udden Swell of the Stream, and carried off and drown'd. The People this way talk much of an antient City they had formerly here|about. The Antiquaries agree, there was one called by the <HI>Romans, Cataractonium,</HI> but differ as to its Situation; but, I think, Mr. <HI>Salmon</HI> has placed it mo&s;t probably upon the Confluences of the <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Greta,</HI> at a Place called <HI>Merton</HI>; where indeed the Remains of it are very vi&s;ible; and al&s;o about <HI>Greta|bridge,</HI> which is ju&s;t by it.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the River, and entered <HI>Bernard's-ca&s;tle,</HI> which lies on the North Side of it, and con|&s;equently within the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI> It was built by the Grandfather of <HI>Baliol,</HI> King of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and is an antient well-built Town, but not large. Here they have an excellent Art of dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="143" REF="144">
their Hides into Leather, out of which they make the be&s;t Bridles, Reins, and Belts; as at <HI>Rippon</HI> they were wont to furni&s;h you with the be&s;t Spurs and Stirrups.</P>
<P>The Manufacture for Stockens continues thus far, and flouri&s;hes here and at <HI>Marwood,</HI> and other little Villages on the Borders of <HI>Durham</HI>; but the Jockey-trade extends much farther.</P>
<P>Between this Part of the Bi&s;hoprick where this Town &s;tands, on the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> on the We&s;t, a mountainous Tract of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> runs, like a Promontory, up Northward a great way, Hill upon upon Hill, Cliffs, Rocks, and terrible Precipices, mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing to behold. This rugged Part of the Country is called <HI>Stanmore Hills,</HI> which are de&s;olate and &s;olitary, excepting one Inn, for the Entertain|ment of &s;uch as may be hardy enough to go among them. As for us, we did not think it worth our while. But here are, it &s;eems, abundance of the Frolicks of Nature in Stone, which exactly re&s;emble Serpents, and other various Forms.</P>
<P>The We&s;t Side of the Bi&s;hoprick being very mountainous too, and corre&s;ponding with that of <HI>Stanmore,</HI> we turned North-ea&s;t, to vi&s;it a little Market-town, but a little way off, called <HI>Stainthorp</HI>; but being of no other Note than having a &s;tately Tomb in the Church to the Memory of one of the <HI>Nevils,</HI> and his two Wives, we pa&s;&s;ed on to <HI>Raby</HI> Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands ju&s;t by it, the antient Seat of that Family; but now of the Lord <HI>Vane.</HI> But it has nothing remarkable in it.</P>
<P>We came next to <HI>Piers-bridge,</HI> to which the <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;way leads, or, as they call it, <HI>Leeming-lane.</HI> Here have been many remarkable Remains of Antiquity dug up, and particularly an old Altar|piece. We thought to have returned by this Bridge into <HI>York&s;hire</HI>; but were de&s;irous to take in <HI>Darling|ton</HI> fir&s;t, and pa&s;s over the <HI>Tees</HI> there.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145"><HI>Darlington</HI> is remarkable for its dirty Situation; for a beautiful Church, with a high Spire ri&s;ing up from the Mid&s;t of it; and for a good long Stone Bridge, over very little or no Water. It is a large con|&s;iderable Market-town of great Re&s;ort, and well &s;upplied. The Market-place is large and convenient. It is noted for the Linen Manufacture, as the Water of the <HI>Skern,</HI> on which it is &s;ituated, is exceeding good for Bleeching, in&s;omuch that Linen has been &s;ent hither from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to bleech; but it particu|larly excels in Huggabags of Ten Quarters wide, which are made no-where el&s;e in <HI>England</HI>; and of which, as well as other Linen-cloth, it &s;ends up large Quantities to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>A greater Rarity, I may mention in this Town, was our Landlord, at the <HI>Fleece</HI> Inn, by Name <HI>Henry Lovell,</HI> who died in <HI>May</HI> 1739, in the 93d Year of his Age, and had kept this Inn ever &s;ince 1688. He was never known to have one Hour's Sickne&s;s, nor even the Head-ach, tho' a free Toper of Ale, &s;ome|times for Days and Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but had an Aver&s;ion to Drams of all kinds, retained his Hear|ing, Sight and Memory, to his la&s;t Moments. He never made u&s;e of Spectacles, nor ever lo&s;t a Tooth. He was e&s;teemed in his Life, and lamented at his Death, being of a humane Temper, and had the De|portment of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>At <HI>Oxehall,</HI> near this Town, we &s;aw the famous <HI>Hell Kettles</HI>; which are Three deep Pits full of Water; which have occa&s;ioned many fabulous Stories among the Country-people, and divers Conjectures among the Learned; but they &s;eem to be nothing el&s;e but old Coal pits (and yet there is no Coal near them now) filled by the Water of the <HI>Tees,</HI> thro' &s;ome &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;&s;age, as 'tis &s;aid, Bi&s;hop <HI>Tun|&s;tal</HI> experienced, by marking a Goo&s;e, and putting her into one of the Pits; which he found next Day in the <HI>Tees.</HI> Others &s;ay, they were occa&s;ioned by an
<PB N="145" REF="146">
Earthquake, which is recorded in the Chronicle of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> for the Year 1179, when the Earthquake happened.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed on Ea&s;t, and came to <HI>Yarum</HI> Bridge, where we re-cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tees.</HI> It is a very good and well-built Bridge. The Town is incorporated, and but &s;mall, lying near the Influx of the little River <HI>Levan</HI> into the <HI>Tees.</HI> It has &s;een much better Days; but, however, of late Years, it is a little recovered, and carries a pretty Trade, by Water, for Lead, Corn, and Butter, with <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stoke&s;by</HI> is al&s;o but a &s;mall Market-town, and &s;tands near the Source of the &s;ame River, a few Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Yarum,</HI> inland; which lies in a little Tract of rich and fruitful Ground, called <HI>Allerton&s;hire,</HI> and water'd by the River <HI>Wy&s;k.</HI> It is a corporate Town, con&s;i&s;ting of one Street, about half a Mile long, well-built, with a very good Market; and is noted for having the greate&s;t Bea&s;t-fair in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here was a bloody Battle fought, in King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Time, between <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI> and Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Tun&s;tall,</HI> who was Lieutenant in the&s;e Parts for King <HI>Stephen,</HI> which was called <HI>the Battle of the Standard</HI>; which, it &s;eems, never u&s;ed to be erected but when the Kingdom was in imminent danger. The Bi&s;hop prevailed, and routed the <HI>Scots,</HI> tho' <HI>Henry,</HI> King <HI>David</HI>'s Son, kept the Field of Battle with a Band of hardy Soldiers, after the Bulk of the Army was fled, with their King after them; and fought valiantly, till he was overpower'd, and oblig'd to follow his Father.</P>
<P>From hence we advanced &s;till South, and pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Thir&s;k,</HI> a corporate Town, which has but an ordinary Market, to <HI>Aldborough</HI> and <HI>Borough-brigg,</HI> which lie within Three Miles of <HI>Rippon</HI> upon the River <HI>Eure.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are Two Borough Towns, each &s;ending Two Members to Parliament, which is a Circum|&s;tance
<PB N="146" REF="147">
peculiar to this Place, and to <HI>Weymouth</HI> and <HI>Melcomb</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Borough-brigg,</HI> or <HI>Bridge,</HI> &s;eems to be the modern Town ri&s;en up out of <HI>Aldborough,</HI> the very Names importing as much, the one being <HI>Borough at the Bridge,</HI> and the other <HI>Old Borough,</HI> that was before it. All the Antiquaries are agreed in this, who place on the Side of <HI>Aldborough,</HI> or <HI>Old Borough,</HI> an antient City, and <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, called <HI>I&s;urium Brigantium.</HI> At pre&s;ent there are not &s;o much as the Ruins of a City to be &s;een above Ground. But the Coins, Urns, Vaults, Pavements, and the like, frequently dug up there, give Evidence to the Thing; and &s;ome of them are &s;o very remarkable, that I cannot chu&s;e to refer you to Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> and his Conti|nuator, for farther Satisfaction: only adding to what they have ob&s;erved, that a curious Piece of Antiquity was di&s;cover'd a few Years ago; which is a Mo&s;aick Pavement of &s;ingular Form and Beauty, brought to light on digging the Foundation of a Hou&s;e, and which is now about Two Feet from the Level of the Street.</P>
<P>At the Door of the College is another te&s;&s;elated Pavement of a different Form from the other, and tho' not above Three Yards from it, it is a Foot nearer the Surface of the Street. The former is compo&s;ed of white and black Squares, with a Border of red; but the Stones of this are le&s;&s;er Squares, and are white, yellow, red, and blue.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince more Pavements of this kind were di&s;cover'd on an Eminence called <HI>Borough-hill</HI>; as al&s;o the Foundations of a con&s;iderable Building; two Ba&s;es of Pillars of &s;ome regular Order; large Stones of the grit Kind, with Joints for Cramping; &s;acri|ficing Ve&s;&s;els; Flews for Conveyance of Smoke, or warm Air; Bones and Horns of Bea&s;ts, mo&s;tly Stags; an Ivory Needle; and a Copper <HI>Roman Stylus:</HI> from all which it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed,

that a Temple formerly &s;tood in this Place. I had not &s;o much Curio&s;ity as to go to &s;ee the Three great pyramidal Stones in the Fields on the Left-hand, as you go thro' <HI>Borough-bridge,</HI> which the Country People, being unable to comprehend how they came there, will have to be brought by the Devil, and &s;o call them <HI>The Devil's Arrows.</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> de&s;cribes them, as al&s;o does Mr. <HI>Drake</HI> in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Antiquities of</HI> York, to whom therefore I refer.</P>
<P><HI>Borough-bridge,</HI> the late&s;t built of the two Towns I have mentioned, is undoubtedly very old; for here, in the Barons Wars, was a Battle; and on this Bridge the great <HI>Humphrey de Bohun,</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> was killed by a Soldier, who lay concealed under the Bridge, and wounded him, by thru&s;ting a Spear or Pike, thro' a Chink, into his Body, as he was pa&s;&s;ing over it. From whence we may conclude, with Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> that it was a Timber Bridge then, and not built of Stone, as it is now.</P>
<P>At <HI>Borough-brigg</HI> the Battle was fought between King <HI>Edward</HI> II. and his Barons, who were defeated, and after en&s;ued the bloody Execution at <HI>Pontefract,</HI> of the Earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and others of the Barons, as I mentioned when I &s;poke of <HI>Pontefract.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Two Borough Towns lying near the Centre of this va&s;t County, and on the Skirts of the North and We&s;t Ridings, and there being a great many Towns about the Middle of the fir&s;t, that we could not more conveniently vi&s;it than from hence; we therefore &s;truck away Ea&s;t, and North-ea&s;t, through the Towns of <HI>Hovingham, Rydell, Heme&s;ley,</HI> and <HI>Kirkby Moore Side</HI>; which is &s;o called becau&s;e it lies on the Side of <HI>Blackamoore.</HI> But they were far from an&s;wering our Trouble of going &s;o far out of the Way, (excepting that <HI>Heme&s;ley</HI> &s;eemed to be tolerably well-built with Stone, and the Hou&s;es covered with Slate) the Two fir&s;t having hardly a Market. But the Situation of <HI>Rydell</HI> is plea&s;ant,
<PB N="148" REF="149">
being in a fine fruitful Vale, wherein are 23 Pari&s;h-churches.</P>
<P>We then turned South-ea&s;t, and came to <HI>Picke|ring,</HI> a pretty large well-built Town, which has a well-furni&s;hed Market, and belongs to the Duchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> having Juri&s;diction over &s;everal neigh|bouring Villages, and is called, <HI>The Honour of Picke|ring.</HI> It has formerly been a fortified Place, as ap|pears by the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, which lie upon a Hill.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituate on the We&s;t Side of a wild hilly Country, and a Fore&s;t which is within the Liberty of the Town, and called <HI>Pickering Fore&s;t</HI>; which we did not care to traver&s;e over, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed South-we&s;t down to <HI>Malton</HI> on the <HI>Derwent.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is divided into Two Parts, by the River, which are called <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Malton.</HI> The <HI>Old</HI> is the <HI>Camalodunum</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and was burnt by <HI>Thur&s;tan,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> in King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Cau&s;e, again&s;t <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> the Lord of it, who had betray'd Part of this Country into the Hands of the <HI>Scots</HI>; but <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> being afterwards received into Favour, rebuilt it, and it has been ever &s;ince called <HI>New Malton.</HI> Here has been a famous Abbey, and the Church of it is &s;till &s;tanding, but very ruinous, tho' the Ca&s;tle is quite demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This Town is well-built and inhabited, and has Two well-&s;upplied weekly Markets, which are held by Pre&s;cription; for it is not incorporated. It is the be&s;t Market in the County for Hor&s;es, Cat|tle, and Provi&s;ions; and is noted for Uten&s;ils in Hu&s;bandry. It has likewi&s;e Three hand&s;ome Pari&s;h Churches, and a good Stone Bridge over the <HI>Der|went.</HI> Near this Town is a Well, who&s;e Water is &s;aid to have the &s;ame Virtue as that of <HI>Scar|borough.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;et out from hence, and for &s;ome Miles coa&s;ted along the Banks of <HI>Derwent</HI> towards <HI>York,</HI> taking
<PB N="149" REF="150">
<HI>Hinder&s;kell</HI> in our Way, where the late Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> built the magnificent Seat of <HI>Ca&s;tle How|ard,</HI> upon the Spot of Ground where the old Ca&s;tle &s;tood, in the middle of a Wood; but his Lord&s;hip died before it was fini&s;h'd. I &s;hall mention this again by-and-by.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit, that on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Derwent,</HI> we &s;aw <HI>Auldby,</HI> a little Village, where, 'tis &s;aid, &s;tood, in the <HI>Roman</HI> Times, a City called <HI>Derventis,</HI> where a Company named <HI>Derventien&s;es</HI> was &s;tation'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Derwent</HI> is a River very full of Water, and overflows its Banks, and all the neighbouring Mea|dows, always after Rain. It is likewi&s;e well-&s;tock'd with Fi&s;h, and runs between the Ea&s;t and North Ridings.</P>
<P>We are now entering the great City of <HI>York,</HI> the <HI>Eboracum</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and of &s;uch Account in their Time, that no le&s;s than Three Military Ways pa&s;s'd thro' it; and it was not only a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, but the Seat of &s;ome of the Emperors, and principal Generals, particularly of <HI>Severus</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantius Chlorus,</HI> the Father of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great.</HI></P>
<P>In our Approach to it we di&s;covered many vi&s;ible Marks of Antiquity, not reducible to De&s;cription; and tho' Time and Misfortunes have &s;o deeply effaced all Traces of its once glorious Splendor, yet &s;ome noble Remains of Maje&s;ty are &s;till to be &s;een there, e&s;pecially as we viewed it from a ri&s;ing Hill at &s;ome &s;mall Di&s;tance on the <HI>London</HI> Road: nay, after we were within the Walls, and had Lei&s;ure to look about, we found our&s;elves not di&s;appointed in the Idea we had before conceived of it; and every Traveller, who is inqui&s;itive in the Search of Anti|quities or Curio&s;ities, will be tempted to make &s;ome Stay at <HI>York</HI>; there being a very great Variety of each to detain and amu&s;e him.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">Among the former I &s;hall only mention the Arch at <HI>Micklegate-bar,</HI> and the multangular Tower and Wall, near a Place called the <HI>Mint-yard,</HI> both built in the Time of the <HI>Romans.</HI> But whether the Two Statues now pro&s;trate on the Wall of St. <HI>Lau|rence Church-yard,</HI> be <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Saxon,</HI> is hard to determine: certain it is, that the &s;epulchral Mo|nument of the Standard-bearer to the Ninth Legion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Army was dug up near <HI>Micklegate</HI>; and in other Parts of the City have been found many <HI>Roman</HI> Altars, In&s;criptions, Urns, Coins and the like, now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Curious.</P>
<P>I do not include the Ruins of Abbeys, Churches and Ca&s;tles, now to be &s;een in this Place, among the Antiquities of it, becau&s;e they are but of a late Date, compared with the antient Remains, of the <HI>Roman</HI> Skill and Grandeur, and becau&s;e they would take up more Time and Room than the Nature of my Work will allow.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>York</HI> is &s;urrounded by a &s;trong Wall, kept in good Repair, in which are four Gates, and five Po&s;terns. It is a County of it&s;elf, extending ever all the <HI>Wapontake,</HI> called <HI>Ain&s;ty,</HI> and is governed by a Mayor, who is &s;tyled Lord, as at <HI>London,</HI> a Recorder, 12 Aldermen, in Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, two Sheriffs, 24 Prime Common-council Men, eight Chamberlains, 72 Common-council Men, a Town-clerk, Sword-bearer, and Common Sergeant; and the Mayor and Aldermen have Con&s;ervation of the Rivers <HI>Ouze, Humber, Wher&s;e, Derwent, Air,</HI> and <HI>Dun,</HI> within certain Limits of each.</P>
<P>This City always gives Title to the &s;econd Prince of the Blood Royal, and the two Citizens they re|turn to Parliament, have a Privilege of taking their Places in the Hou&s;e of Commons, next the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> upon what is called the Privy Coun&s;ellor's Bench; a Privilege which, if neglected to be claimed, ought to be made known, as it appertains to the
<PB N="151" REF="152">
Citizens of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>York</HI> only, and is by tho&s;e of <HI>London,</HI> exerci&s;ed the fir&s;t Day of the Meeting of every new Parliament.</P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>York</HI> is in a Plain on both Sides the River <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI> It was formerly very populous, and had a great Trade; but has declined &s;ince the Re|formation, and the Difu&s;e of the Court of Pre&s;ident of the North. In <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth's Time there were 41 Pari&s;hes, 17 Chapels, 16 Ho&s;pitals, and nine Abbeys, be&s;ides the Cathedral, and now there are only 17 Churches in U&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Support of the City is chiefly owing to the Gentry, who make it their Winter Re&s;idence, as there is great Plenty of Provi&s;ions of all kinds to furni&s;h an elegant Table at a moderate Expence, &s;o that the Altar, which was found there, with a <HI>Ro|man</HI> In&s;cription, is applicable to the pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances of the Place, DIS DEABUSQUE HOSPITA|LIBUS. And as the Inhabitants abound with the Conveniencies of Life, they likewi&s;e partake of its Diver&s;ions, there being Plays, A&s;&s;emblies, Mu&s;ick-Meetings, or &s;ome Entertainments, every Night in the Week.</P>
<P>The publick Edifices which mo&s;t de&s;erve Mention, I &s;hall now take Notice of, and fir&s;t of the Bridge over the <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of five Arches: the Dia|meter of the middle Arch, which was the large&s;t in the Kingdom, before that at <HI>Blenheim</HI> Hou&s;e was built, is 81 Feet, and its Height 51 Feet. The Rea&s;on it was built &s;o wide, was on occa&s;ion of an Accident which once happen'd to it, when upon a &s;udden Thaw, which occa&s;ion'd a great Flood, a prodigious Weight of Ice drove down two Arches of the old Bridge, by which 12 Hou&s;es were demo|li&s;hed, and &s;everal Per&s;ons drown'd.</P>
<P>The great Council-chamber for this City, near which the Records are kept, as al&s;o the Exchequer and Courts of the Sheriffs, and beneath them the
<PB N="152" REF="153">
two City Pri&s;ons for Debtors and Felons, are all upon this Bridge.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle which &s;tands at the Confluence of the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Fo&s;s,</HI> was built by <HI>William</HI> the Con|queror, <HI>Anno</HI> 1069; and tho' the Face it now wears, and the U&s;e made of it, are &s;o different from that which was the primitive State of this Fortre&s;s, yet in its pre&s;ent Di&s;gui&s;e, it brought to my Memory that Tragical Scene of Blood&s;hed perpetrated within its Walls, upon the 11th of <HI>March</HI> 1189; which being to be met with in very few Hi&s;torians, I &s;hall give a brief Account of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews,</HI> from their fir&s;t Introduction into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> growing immen&s;ly rich by Traffick, never failed to become the Objects of Envy and Hatred, both to Prince and People, and the &s;lighte&s;t Pre|tences were always eagerly laid hold of, to plunder them; &s;o that on every new Acce&s;&s;ion or Turn of Affairs, they were forced to compound for their Safety, by large Pre&s;ents to the Prince.</P>
<P>At the Acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Richard</HI> I. tho' that Prince gave them no Di&s;turbance, yet he i&s;&s;ued out an Order, that no <HI>Jew</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the Cere|mony of his Coronation, either at Church or at Dinner.</P>
<P>However the chief of the <HI>Jews,</HI> from all Parts, being &s;ummoned to <HI>London</HI> by their Brethren there, in order to agree upon a rich Gift to the new King to obtain his Favour and Protection, many of them, notwith&s;tanding the Injunction, had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Ceremony; and being di&s;covered among the Croud by the Guards, they were beat, abu&s;ed, and &s;ome of them killed.</P>
<P>The People hereupon, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a No|tion, that the King had given Orders, that the <HI>Jews</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> be de&s;troyed, began a Ma&s;&s;acre of them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and plundered and burnt their Hou&s;es, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> them many of their Wives and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">And tho' the King immediately ordered a Procla|mation to &s;top the&s;e Proceedings, yet the Example at <HI>London</HI> was followed at <HI>Norwich, Lynn,</HI> and <HI>Stam|ford,</HI> and with &s;till greater Fury at <HI>York,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding the King, at his Departure to the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> left Orders for the Protection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Puni&s;hment of &s;uch as &s;hould mole&s;t them; for, being inflamed by a wicked Prie&s;t, certain bloody Wretches, who had re&s;olved upon the De&s;truction of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to inrich them&s;elves with their Pillage, &s;et Fire to a Part of the City of <HI>York</HI>; and while the Citi|zens were bu&s;y in extingui&s;hing the Flames, broke into the Hou&s;e of a principal <HI>Jew,</HI> who had been murder'd at <HI>London,</HI> and who&s;e Wife had &s;trength|ened it for her Defence; and murdering the whole Family, and all who had taken Refuge there, burnt the Hou&s;e to the Ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> hereupon, in the utmo&s;t Terror, got Leave to convey all their Wealth into the Ca&s;tle, and obtain'd Shelter there for their own Per&s;ons, and for their Wives and Children, except &s;ome few, who were &s;acrific'd to the Rage of the Populace; who burnt all the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Jews</HI> throughout the City.</P>
<P>It unluckily happen'd, that the Governor of the Ca&s;tle having Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Town, the poor <HI>Jews,</HI> being afraid he went out to agree upon delivering them up to their Enemies, refu&s;ed him Admittance into it; which incen&s;ing him, he apply'd to the High Sheriff, who rai&s;ing the <HI>Po&s;&s;e Comitatus,</HI> be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle, and reduced the <HI>Jews</HI> to &s;o great Ex|tremity, that being refu&s;ed Mercy, tho' they offer'd to buy it at the Expence of immen&s;e Sums, they took the dreadful Advice of one of their Rabbi's, come lately among them from abroad; and fir&s;t having burnt all their rich Goods, and &s;o damnify'd even their Plate, that their barbarous Enemies could not be much the better for their Spoils, they &s;et Fire to all the Towers of the Ca&s;tle, and fell each Man to
<PB N="154" REF="155">
cutting of the Throats of his own Family, till they had de&s;troy'd all who came into this dreadful Scheme of their Rabbi's, who, in the la&s;t Place, followed the Advice he had given.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Fire of the Ca&s;tle in|crea&s;ing, a Number of unhappy <HI>Jews,</HI> who would not come into this bloody Action, (in vain endea|vouring to extingui&s;h it) from the Walls be&s;ought the Mercy of the Be&s;iegers, acquainting them with what had happened; and threw over the dead Bodies of their Brethren, in Confirmation of the Truth of what they &s;aid; and offering to become Chri&s;tians, had Hopes given them of their Lives: but no &s;ooner did their mercile&s;s Enemies gain Admittance, than they butcher'd every one of the <HI>Jews,</HI> calling aloud for Bapti&s;m, in hopes of e&s;caping their wor&s;e than <HI>Pagani&s;h</HI> Cruelty.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfy'd with this, the barbarous Robbers, as well as Murderers, ran next to the Cathedral, where were depo&s;ited the Bonds and other Securities of the Money owing to the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Chri&s;tians, broke open the Che&s;ts, and de&s;troyed them all.</P>
<P>There were 500 Men who took Shelter in the Ca&s;tle, be&s;ides Women and Children. So that the whole Number of the <HI>Jews</HI> thus mi&s;erably &s;laughter'd, mu&s;t be between 1000 and 1500, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were ma&s;&s;acred in the City.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t do this Ju&s;tice to the King, who was then in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> that as &s;oon as he heard of this unparalleled Proceeding, he was highly incen&s;ed, and &s;ent Orders to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> his Chancel|lor and Regent, to go down in Per&s;on to <HI>York,</HI> and execute &s;trict Ju&s;tice, without Favour or Affection, on all Offenders. The Bi&s;hop came to the City, but the chief Authors of the Riot had fled to <HI>Scot|land.</HI> However, the Citizens were laid under a large Fine, and the Sheriff and Governor of the Ca&s;tle were removed from their Places, and com|mitted
<PB N="155" REF="156">
to Pri&s;on; and the Soldiers concerned in the Fray were puni&s;hed, and turned out of Service; but not one Man, either then or afterwards, was executed for the unheard-of Villainy.</P>
<P>The Strength of this Ca&s;tle has been often ex|perienced in Times of War, and become famous in Hi&s;tory, upon Account of &s;everal memorable Events. We hope for the future there will never be occa&s;ion to make any other U&s;e of it than to the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary Purpo&s;e, to which it is now converted, namely, a Pri&s;on; but a Pri&s;on the mo&s;t &s;tately and complete of any in the whole Kingdom, if not in <HI>Europe.</HI> The pre&s;ent Edifice was erected in the Year 1701. In the left Wing of the Building is a hand&s;ome Chapel, neatly adorned with &s;uitable Fur|niture, and an Allowance of 40<HI>l.</HI> a Year is &s;ettled upon a Mini&s;ter, for performing Divine Service, and Preaching to the Pri&s;oners weekly; and &s;uch of the Debtors as attend at Sermons, are allowed each a large Loaf of fine Bread. The Ju&s;tices of the Peace take great Care, that the Gaol &s;hall be kept as neat within-&s;ide, as it is noble without. The Felons are allowed Straw, and their Beds are now rai&s;ed from the Ground: and there is an Infirmary apart from the common Pri&s;on, to which the Sick are con|veyed, and a Surgeon has an appointed Salary to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle-yard is larger than the Areas of the <HI>Fleet</HI> or <HI>King's-Bench</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and the Situation is &s;o high, plea&s;ant, and airy, that 'tis &s;urpri&s;ing any Pri&s;oners &s;hould remove them&s;elves by <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> to either of tho&s;e Pri&s;ons, unle&s;s it be with a View of purcha&s;ing the Liberty of the Rules, be|cau&s;e here they are never permitted to go without the Walls. Strangers, who vi&s;it the In&s;ide of it, &s;el|dom depart without making a trifling Purchace of &s;ome of the &s;mall Manufactures the Pri&s;oners work up for Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">The next Building we come to is the A&s;&s;embly-room, for the Entertainment of the Nobility and Gentry, who re&s;ide at <HI>York</HI> during the Races. It was de&s;igned by the Earl of <HI>Burlington.</HI> That Part which is the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hall, taken from a Draught of <HI>Pal|ladio,</HI> is in Length 123 Feet, 40 broad, and rather more in Height. This Hall communicates with the common Ball-room, in Length 66 Feet, in Height and Breadth 22 Feet, be&s;ides other Rooms for Cards and Tea: all richly decorated and illuminated with magnificent Lu&s;tres. The Front to the Street is an exceeding fine Piece of Architecture; but the <HI>Egyp|tian</HI> Hall, if you except the Banqueting-hou&s;e at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> may undoubtedly claim the Preference of any other Room in the Kingdom, if not in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> The Expence of this Edifice, amounting to &s;everal thou&s;and Pounds, was defrayed by Sub&s;crip|tions, chiefly among the Nobility and Gentry of the County, who contributed, &s;ome 50<HI>l.</HI> and none le&s;s than 25<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1728, a very hand&s;ome Man&s;ion-hou&s;e was erected for the Lord-Mayor; the Ba&s;e|ment is a Ru&s;tick Arcade, which &s;upports an <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, with a Pediment in it. There is a large Room the Length of the Front, 49 Feet by 29, &s;o that this City has had the Honour to begin a Prece|dent for the City of <HI>London</HI> to copy after.</P>
<P>The Guild-Hall is a Building very well de&s;erving Notice, as likewi&s;e are &s;everal other publick Edifices, which are equally u&s;eful and ornamental to this an|tient City.</P>
<P>But what exceeds all others in it, is the Cathedral Church, which for Magnificence of Structure chal|lenges the Pre-eminence of all other <HI>Gothick</HI> Churches, not only in this Kingdom, but throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> if I may rely upon the Opinion of a Gentleman, with whom I viewed it, and who had &s;een the Churches at <HI>Stra&s;burgh, Milan,</HI> and <HI>Notre Dame</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">The City of <HI>Lincoln</HI> indeed contends with this of <HI>York,</HI> for a Preference to its Cathedral; and as this is a Point in which both Cities are very tena|cious, I will di&s;tingui&s;h the Particulars wherein each of them have the Advantage over the other, as I have promi&s;ed in Page 6.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place then, <HI>Lincoln</HI> Cathedral has greatly the Advantage of <HI>York,</HI> in the Height of its Situation; and by different Accounts given by &s;everal Authors, of the Dimen&s;ions of both Churches, it appears <HI>Lincoln</HI> exceeds <HI>York</HI> in Length, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, either 14, or 11, or three Feet and a half: in the middle Cro&s;s or Tran&s;ept from North to South, five Feet; in the outward Breadth of the We&s;t End, by the Addition of two Chapels, as at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, <HI>London,</HI> 53 Feet; in the Height of the We&s;t Towers and Spires 72 Feet; and of the mid|dle Tower, including the Pinacles, 75 Feet.</P>
<P><HI>York</HI> exceeds <HI>Lincoln</HI> in the Breadth of its middle Nef, and Side Ayles, within-&s;ide, 26 Feet; in the Height of the middle Nef to its Canopy, 17 Feet; and in the in&s;ide Height of the middle Lantern, 64 Feet and a half.</P>
<P>The Breadth of the We&s;t End of <HI>Lincoln</HI> will not the lea&s;t avail in this Di&s;pute, as it has &s;o many egregious Defects, not to &s;ay Ab&s;urdities. The two Steeples are crouded together, in&s;tead of being placed at the Extremities of the Front, which by that means would have had an Appearance much more grand. They ri&s;e up above the Body of the Church, as if behind a Screen, without the lea&s;t Affinity to any Part of the Building below. Their Ornaments are but mean, and the Leaden Spires upon them &s;till meaner. The whole Front, extending in a &s;trait Line, wants Boldne&s;s when viewed at &s;ome Di&s;tance; and there is &s;uch an Expan&s;ion of &s;olid Wall, without Windows, or any &s;ort of Aperture, as gives a Hea|vine&s;s throughout. The cloi&s;tred Work, or Niches
<PB N="158" REF="159">
for Images, which is the chief ornamental Part of <HI>Gothick</HI> Structures, is di&s;po&s;ed with a &s;hameful Di&s;|regard to every thing like De&s;ign: in one Place, crouded with needle&s;s Profu&s;ion; in another, wanted to fill up, where now there is nothing but a naked and dead Space; and in the Ornaments the Fancy is &s;o irregularly varied, that all kind of Connexion and Harmony is de&s;troyed, &s;o that the Building to Ap|pearance has the &s;ame Effect, as if it were Pieces of different Structures patched up together.</P>
<P>The Plan of the Church is very irregular, the middle Tran&s;ept from North to South having no Ayles on the We&s;t-&s;ide, to an&s;wer tho&s;e on the Ea&s;t. The upper Tran&s;ept, or double Cro&s;s, can never be con&s;idered as a beautiful Addition, e&s;pecially &s;ince this, and the Ea&s;tern Parts beyond, are &s;urrounded with Chapels and Ve&s;tries erected without Unifor|mity, and the Windows of the Church are meanly &s;mall, crouded, and out of Proportion.</P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erved, there is a great Re&s;emblance between the Ground-plat of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and that of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the one was certainly built after the Model of the other.</P>
<P>The only Defect objected to <HI>York,</HI> is, that the middle Tower or Lantern wants Height, and that the Cro&s;s or Tran&s;ept, from North to South, is built in a different Style and Manner from the re&s;t of the Cathedral. Both the&s;e mu&s;t be admitted to be Faults; but, by the way, the middle Lantern is as lofty as the celebrated Towers of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> exclu&s;ive of their Pinacles, tho' not &s;uf|ficiently high in proportion to its Breadth, being 70 Feet &s;quare, or to the Height of the Church. They have a Tradition in this City, that a Wooden Spire was once intended to have been rai&s;ed upon this Tower; which in that Ca&s;e would have ex|ceeded the Height of <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> Steeple, as the pre|&s;ent Battlements are higher by &s;ix Feet, and of a
<PB N="159" REF="160">
larger Square than the pre&s;ent Tower at <HI>Sali&s;|bury.</HI></P>
<P>I am not &s;orry this Project failed, becau&s;e 'tis ob|vious all Wooden Spires have a mo&s;t wretched A&s;pect.</P>
<P>The only Amendment that can be made, would be to pull down the Bell-turret at one Corner, and to rai&s;e the Battlements about 20 Feet, piercing them thro' with proper Ornaments; and carry four Pinacles above them, about 20 Feet more.</P>
<P>However, this Building has two remarkable Beau|ties not to be found in any other <HI>Gothick</HI> Edifice; which are, that the Height and Breadth of the Nef and Side Ayles of the Church, and of all the Arches and Windows come very near, if not agree with, the Dimen&s;ions laid down by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Rules of <HI>Roman</HI> Architecture; that the Span of the Roof; from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, ri&s;es very near equal to the mo|dern Proportion; the exce&s;&s;ive Height of the Roofs being the chief Blemi&s;hes in mo&s;t Cathedrals, as may be &s;een at <HI>Lincoln, Sali&s;bury, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and par|ticularly <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Plan of the whole Church is uniform, as well as the Super&s;tructure, e&s;pecially from Ea&s;t to We&s;t: the Windows are of a Size and Di&s;tance proper to the Magnitude of the Structure, and are admirable for their Workman&s;hip; neither is it crouded and encumbered on the Out&s;ide by its Butre&s;&s;es, but every Part is inrich'd with Ornaments, which receive an additional Beauty from the Colour of the Stone, as it retains almo&s;t its original Whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus far what I have &s;aid of this Building in general was nece&s;&s;ary, in comparing it with <HI>Lin|coln.</HI> I will now take &s;ome Notice of its &s;everal Parts di&s;tinctly both within-&s;ide and without, begin|ning fir&s;t at the Out&s;ide.</P>
<P>The We&s;t End, which is 124 Feet in Breadth, &s;hews a Grandeur inexpre&s;&s;ible; this Front contains
<PB N="160" REF="161">
two uniform Towers, dimini&s;hed by &s;everal Con|tractions, all cloi&s;tred for Imagery, and inrich'd with other Ornaments. In the South Tower hangs a deep Peal of 12 Bells, the Tenor weighing 59 hun|dred Weight.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e Towers, over the principal En|trance into the Church, is a large Window, who&s;e Tracery in Ma&s;ons Work is of a Figure &s;o beau|tiful, that it cannot be equalled any-where. The &s;everal Windows in the Towers are large, and their Tracery and Ornaments well fan&s;ied.</P>
<P>The South Entrance is a&s;cended by &s;everal Cour&s;es of Steps, and Tradition a&s;&s;ures us, there was once as great an A&s;cent to the We&s;t Door. Here a re|markable Spiral Turret is erected on the middle of the Pediment, and called the <HI>Fiddlers Turret,</HI> from an Image of a Fidler on the Top. Over the Door is a Dial both Horary and Solar, on each Side of which two Images &s;trike the Quarters on two Bells.</P>
<P>In viewing the Building from this Part Ea&s;tward, we ea&s;ily di&s;cerned it to be much newer than that We&s;tward, tho' conformable to it.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t Front is exceeding noble, and has the fine&s;t Window in the World.</P>
<P>The North Side is the &s;ame as the South: only a Wall is built to prevent Night-walkers, and other di&s;orderly Per&s;ons, from ne&s;ting and intriguing in the ob&s;cure Corners of the Buttre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Lantern Steeple, of which I have &s;poken already, is ornamented in a fine Ta&s;te, wanting nothing but a better Fini&s;hing at the Top: it has eight Windows, two on each Side, to give Light within; the&s;e Windows from Top to Bottom are 45 Feet high.</P>
<P>We now entered the In&s;ide, at the We&s;t Door, opening into the middle Nef of the Church, under the large&s;t <HI>Gothick</HI> Arch in <HI>Europe,</HI> which binds and &s;upports the two Towers. The Nef is the mo&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="162">
&s;pacious of any in <HI>Europe,</HI> except <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome</HI>; it exceeds the Dimen&s;ions of the Nef of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Cathedral four Feet &s;ix Inches in Width, and 11 Feet in Height; and that of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey</HI> 16 Feet &s;ix Inches in Breadth, but its Height is two Feet le&s;s. This is an In&s;tance of what I took No|tice of before, with regard to the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Proportion of <HI>York</HI> Cathedral, and at the &s;ame time &s;hews the Extravagance of that of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey,</HI> in this Particular. The Canopy at Top is inriched with curious Knots of Carving.</P>
<P>From thence we proceeded under the Middle Lan|tern, to a Stone Screen, that parts the Choir from the Body of the Church, adorned with curious Work|man&s;hip, among which are placed the Statues of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings, from the Conque&s;t, to <HI>Henry</HI> VI.</P>
<P>Over the Entrance into the Choir &s;tands the Organ, having a double Front; it had before been removed from thence by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. to one Side, oppo&s;ite to the Bi&s;hop's Throne. The Rea&s;on his Maje&s;ty gave for doing it, was, That it &s;poil'd the Pro&s;pect of the fine Ea&s;t Windows from the Body of the Church.</P>
<P>The Choir is adorned with antient Wood-work carved, and &s;et up with Clu&s;ters of knotted Pinacles of different Heights. The A&s;cent from the Body of the Church, thro' the Choir to the Altar, is by a Gradation of 16 Steps. The Altar has lately re|ceived a con&s;iderable Improvement as to its Situa|tion, and the whole Church in its Beauty, by taking away a large wooden Screen, which almo&s;t ob&s;tructed the View of the Ea&s;t Window. By this means it was carried one Arch farther back, to a Stone Screen of excellent <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture; which now not only &s;hews a Beauty in it&s;elf, before hid, but opens a View to one of the noble&s;t Lights in the World, both for Ma&s;onry and Glazing; which is the afore|mentioned Ea&s;t Window.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163">This Window is 30 Feet Nine Inches broad, and 75 Feet high: the Upper-part is a Piece of fine Tracery, but, in my Opinion, not &s;o beautiful as that at the We&s;t End. Below the Tracery are 117 Partitions, wherein are repre&s;ented, in fine painted Gla&s;s, mo&s;t of the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Bible.</HI> This Window was glazed in 1405, by one <HI>John Thornton,</HI> Glazier of <HI>Coventry</HI>; who received, for his own Work, 4<HI>s.</HI> a Week; and contracted to fini&s;h the Whole in Three Years.</P>
<P>In a circular Window, at the South End of the Church, is another fine Piece of Ma&s;onry, in the Form of a Wheel, called <HI>The Marygold Window,</HI> from its painted Gla&s;s, which re&s;embles the Colour of that Flower. The North End has Five noble Lights: each con&s;titute one large Window, and reach almo&s;t from Top to Bottom. There is a Tradition, that Five Maiden Si&s;ters were at the Expence of the&s;e Lights. The Painting of the Gla&s;s repre&s;ents a kind of Embroidery, or <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Needle-work; which might perhaps give Occa&s;ion to the Story.</P>
<P>I ought not to omit mentioning, that all the Win|dows of the Church, except one or two, are adorned with painted Gla&s;s, repre&s;enting the Sacred Hi&s;tory, and the Portraitures of eminent Per&s;ons. This Paint|ing was pre&s;erved at the Time of the Civil Wars, by the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> General of the Parliament's Army, who, at the Reque&s;t of the Gentry and Citizens of <HI>York,</HI> placed a Guard of Soldiers about the Church for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Body of the Church has been lately new paved, the Plan of which was drawn by that ingenious Architect Mr. <HI>Kent,</HI> under the Direction of the Earl of <HI>Burlington:</HI> the Figure is <HI>Mo&s;aick,</HI> and properly adapted to a <HI>Gothick</HI> Building.</P>
<P>The Monuments in this Church are numerous, many of them very antient, and &s;everal very magni|ficent;
<PB N="163" REF="164">
but to enumerate them di&s;tinctly, would take up more Room than I can &s;pare.</P>
<P>After taking this View of the Cathedral, we were conducted into the Chapter-hou&s;e; a Building which, for a <HI>Gothick</HI> Piece, di&s;dains to allow an Equal in the Univer&s;e, and well de&s;erves the Encomium be&s;towed upon it, as is &s;aid, by a great Traveller, in an old Monki&s;h Ver&s;e in&s;cribed on the Wall, in Golden Letters, as follows:
<Q><L><HI>Ut ro&s;a phlos phlorum, &s;ic e&s;t domus i&s;ta domorum.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis an Octagon of 63 Feet Diameter. The Height to the Middle Knot of the Roof is 67 Feet ten Inches, un&s;upported by any Pillars, and intirely de|pendent upon one Pin geometrically placed in the Centre. The whole Roof has been richly painted, and the Knots of carved Work, gilt; but is now defaced and &s;ullied by Time. Over the Roof is a Spire of Timber-work, covered with Lead, admired as a ma&s;terly Piece of Work in the Carpenter's Art. The Eight Squares of the Octagon have each a Win|dow beautifully adorned, and imbelli&s;hed with painted Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The next Place we &s;aw was the Ve&s;try-room; its Dimen&s;ions 44 Feet by 22: wherein are kept &s;everal Antiquities, particularly the famous Horn &s;o called, made of an Elephant's Tooth; which is indeed the greate&s;t Piece of Antiquity the Church can exhibit, and to which they ought to pay a high Veneration, on Account of the Benefit they reap, from the Act that it witne&s;&s;ed to. The Account <HI>Camden</HI> gives of it, is;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That <HI>Ulphus</HI> the Son of <HI>Toraldus,</HI> who governed in the We&s;t Parts of <HI>Deira,</HI> by rea&s;on of a Difference likely to happen betwixt his elde&s;t Son and his younge&s;t, about his Lord|&s;hip, when he was dead, pre&s;ently took this Cour&s;e: Without Delay he went to <HI>York,</HI> and taking the Horn, wherein he was wont to drink,
<PB N="164" REF="165">
with him, he filled it with Wine; and kneeling before the Altar, be&s;towed upon God, and the ble&s;&s;ed St. <HI>Peter,</HI> all his Lands."</Q></P>
<P>The Lands are &s;till called <HI>de Terra Ulphi.</HI> The Horn was imagined to have been quite lo&s;t; but <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> was the Occa&s;ion of its be|ing pre&s;erved. Where it had lain, or where he got it, is uncertain; but &s;tripp'd of its Golden Orna|ments, it was re&s;tored by his Succe&s;&s;or. The Chapter thought fit to decorate it anew, and be|&s;towed the following In&s;cription, to the Memory of the Re&s;torer, upon it:
<Q>CORNU HOC ULPHUS IN OCCIDENTALI PARTE<LB>DEIRAE PRINCEPS, UNA CUM OMNIBUS TERRIS<LB>ET REDDITIBUS SUIS, OLIM DONAVIT.<LB>AMISSVM, VEL ABREPTVM,<LB>HENRICUS DOM. FAIRFAX DEMVM RESTITVIT.<LB>DEC. ET CAPIT. DE NOVO ORNAVIT,<LB>A. D. M.DC.LXXV.</Q></P>
<P>I will now conclude my Account of this noble Pile of Building, with the Character given of it (as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> informs us) by <HI>Aeneas Sylvius,</HI> afterwards Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is, &s;ays he, famous for its Mag|nificence and Workman&s;hip, all the World over, but e&s;pecially for a fine light&s;ome <HI>Chapel,</HI> with &s;hining Walls, and &s;mall thin wa&s;ted Pillars quite round."</Q></P>
<P>The South Side of the Church is inriched by a Library, to which Archbi&s;hop <HI>Matthews</HI>'s Widow was a great Benefactre&s;s. A Bi&s;hop was her Father, and an Archbi&s;hop her Father-in-law; &s;he had Four Bi&s;hops for her Brethren, and an Archbi&s;hop for her &s;econd Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop had a Palace in the Min&s;ter-yard, where great Ho&s;pitality was wont to be kept; but it has been long &s;ince lea&s;ed out. And to &s;hew the
<PB N="165" REF="166">
wondrous Change of Times, one End of it is now converted into a Dancing-&s;chool, and the other into a Play-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Archbi&s;hop's Regi&s;ter and Prerogative Office, is a noble Repo&s;itory of antient Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Records, bearing Date 93 Years earlier than any at <HI>Lambeth</HI> or <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>All-Saints</HI> in the <HI>Pavement</HI> is a beautiful old Church, with a <HI>Gothick</HI> Steeple of ex|qui&s;ite Workman&s;hip. Upon the Tower is a fine Lantern (with Pinacles of a con&s;iderable Height) not much unlike that of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St. Margaret</HI>'s Church has one of the mo&s;t extra|ordinary Porches I ever &s;aw. It is a mo&s;t &s;umptuous and elaborate Piece of <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture, with our Saviour on the Cro&s;s on the Top of it: but what &s;eems &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing is, that they &s;ay it did not originally belong to the Church, but was brought hither from the di&s;&s;olved Ho&s;pital of <HI>St. Nicolas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St. Mary's</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;tle-gate</HI> is admired for a pyra|midical Steeple; as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Church is for a very fine modern one.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1738, a Sub&s;cription was &s;et on Foot for an Infirmary in this City, like tho&s;e begun at <HI>London, Winche&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. which we have mentioned. And this excellent Charity has found much Encouragement and Support here.</P>
<P>A Manufacture of Cotton is lately e&s;tabli&s;hed in this City, and is arrived at a very great Perfection; and I could not but be greatly plea&s;ed, when I was there la&s;t, to &s;ee a very hand&s;ome Proce&s;&s;ion made on this Occa&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> on <HI>May-day</HI> 1740, at which Time Mr. <HI>Clough,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Manufactory, together with the &s;everal Artificers concern'd therein, marched thro' the City in the following manner, preceded by the City Mu&s;ick; <HI>viz.</HI> There were Three Stages borne, each by Six Porters: On the fir&s;t Stage were the Teazer, Carder, Rover, Spinner,
<PB N="166" REF="167">
and Reeler of the Cotton-wool. On the &s;econd, the Bleecher and Winder of the Linen-yarn. On the third, the Quill-winder and Weaver. Each Per&s;on exerci&s;ing their &s;everal Branches, from the picking of the Wool to the fini&s;hing the Cloth. The Men, Women and Children, imploy'd in the Manufactory, clo&s;ed the Proce&s;&s;ion, all of them cloathed with Cot|tons, or &s;triped and figured Fu&s;tians of their own making, provided for them by the generous Contri|butions of the Citizens.</P>
<P>This Manufactory being &s;o well fix'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in &s;o &s;hort a time, is principally owing to the great Encouragement given by the City, who are determin'd to &s;pare no Pains or Expences to &s;upport it. The Bells in the Cathedral, and in all the Pari&s;h Churches, rung the whole Time of the Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>York</HI> &s;tands upon more Ground, per|haps, than any in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Nor|wich</HI>; but then the Buildings are not &s;o clo&s;e as at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> or <HI>Durham,</HI> nor is it &s;o populous as either <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> or <HI>Norwich.</HI> But as <HI>York</HI> is full of Gentry, and Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, &s;o they have Hou&s;es pro|portioned to their Quality, which makes the City lie &s;o far extended on both Sides of the River.</P>
<P>While we were here, we took one Day's Time to &s;ee the fatal Field, called <HI>Mar&s;ton Moor,</HI> where Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> a third time, by his Exce&s;s of Va|lour, and Defect of Conduct, lo&s;t the Royal Army, and had a Victory wrung out of his Hands, after he had all the Advantage he could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I made another Excur&s;ion to the Duke of <HI>Leeds</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Kiveton,</HI> then to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI>'s called <HI>Ca&s;tle Howard,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Burlington</HI>'s at <HI>Lane&s;borough</HI> in the Ea&s;t-riding.</P>
<P><HI>Carli&s;le-hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;tle Howard,</HI> is in the Middle of a Wood, which is as great a Wonder in its Kind&punc; as Mr. <HI>Ai&s;labie</HI>'s Park. The Hou&s;e is of a va&s;t Extent&punc; and tho' it makes a fine Appearance at a Di&s;tance&punc;
<PB N="167" REF="168">
yet will it not bear a critical Examination of the Architecture, when viewed near. There goes a Story, That the Architect was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his Errors in one of the Fronts, that he would fain have per&s;uaded the late Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> to pull it down again. The Whole is not yet fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Burlington</HI>'s in an old-built Hou&s;e, mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Ground, with a noble Pro&s;pect as well towards the <HI>Humber,</HI> as towards the <HI>Woulds.</HI></P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e thro' the Fore&s;t of <HI>Galtres,</HI> a little North of the City. It is in &s;ome Places very thick of Trees, and in others very moori&s;h and boggy: it formerly extended to the very Gates of the City, but now 'tis much le&s;&s;en'd; and &s;everal con|&s;iderable Villages are built in it.</P>
<P>Having mentioned &s;o many Fore&s;ts, you'll un|doubtedly conclude, there is no want of Firing in this County. 'Tis very true; for here is not only Wood enough, but Coal too; which is a very great Com|fort to the Poor, again&s;t the Inclemency of this cold Northern Climate, which indeed has very great need of Firing.</P>
<P>At <HI>Hambleton-down</HI> are the Races, where the King's Plate of an hundred Guineas is run for once a Year, by Five-Year-Olds; a Gift no-where better be|&s;towed than on that County, which is &s;o famous for breeding of Hor&s;es for the re&s;t of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>From <HI>York</HI> we enter'd again into the We&s;t-riding, and, travelling due We&s;t, we came to <HI>Wetherby,</HI> upon the River <HI>Aire,</HI> which we omitted to take in our Cour&s;e as we pa&s;&s;ed by this River in our former Journey, being then more out of our Way than here. It is a good Trading Town, but has nothing remarkable in it.</P>
<P>Some Miles farther to the South &s;tands <HI>Tadca&s;ter,</HI> upon the South Side of the River <HI>Wherfe,</HI> where the Road from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and that from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to <HI>York,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="169">
meet; and is con&s;equently well provided for the Reception of Travellers. It is principally noted for Lime-&s;tones, and a fine Stone Bridge over the River. But it has nothing that we could &s;ee to te&s;tify the Antiquity it boa&s;ts of, but &s;ome old <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, which our Landlord the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter &s;hewed us, among which was one of <HI>Domitian,</HI> of the &s;ame Kind, I believe, as that which Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> gives an Account of; but &s;o very much defaced with Age, that we could read but DO, and AV, at a Di&s;tance. Here is the Ho&s;pital and School &s;till remaining, founded by Dr. <HI>Oglethorp,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> who, for want of a Prote&s;tant Archbi&s;hop, &s;et the Crown on the Head of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; but &s;he afterwards, not|with&s;tanding that Circum&s;tance, deprived him.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o we &s;aw plainly the <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;way, which I have before-mentioned at <HI>Aberforth</HI>; and a &s;tately Stone Bridge over the <HI>Wherfe.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> gives us a Di&s;tich of a learned Pa&s;|&s;enger upon this River, and the old Bridge at <HI>Tad|ca&s;ter.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he pa&s;&s;ed it in a dry Summer.<Q><L><HI>Nil,</HI> Tadca&s;ter, <HI>habes Mu&s;is vel carmine dignum,</HI></L>

<L>But a proud Bridge&mdash;with ne'er a Stream beneath.</L></Q></P>
<P>But I can a&s;&s;ure you to the contrary of this; for tho', when I travelled this Way, it was about the Middle of <HI>June,</HI> I found the River pretty full.</P>
<P>On this Road we pa&s;&s;ed over <HI>Towton,</HI> that famous Field, where a mo&s;t cruel and bloody Battle was fought between the Two Hou&s;es of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. I call it mo&s;t cruel and bloody, becau&s;e the Animo&s;ity of the Par+ties was &s;o great, that tho' they were Countrymen and Neighbours, nay, as Hi&s;tory &s;ays, Relations
<PB N="169" REF="170">
(for here Fathers killed their Sons, and Sons their Fathers) for &s;ome time they fought with &s;uch Ob&s;ti|nacy and Rancour, that they gave no Quarter. 'Tis certain &s;uch Numbers were never &s;lain in one Battle in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince that fought between King <HI>Harold</HI> and <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> at <HI>Battle</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>; for here fell in the Whole 36000 Men, and the <HI>Yorki&s;ts</HI> proved victorious.</P>
<P>Tradition guided us to the very Spot; but there remain no vi&s;ible Marks of the Action. The Plough|men indeed &s;ay, that &s;ometimes they turn up Arrow-heads, Spear-heads, broken Javelins, Helmets, and the like.</P>
<P>Farther South &s;till, or rather South-ea&s;t, on the Road to <HI>Donca&s;ter,</HI> &s;tands <HI>Shirbourn,</HI> a pretty good Town, famous for a well endow'd Ho&s;pital, erected by one <HI>Hungate</HI> a Prote&s;tant, for the Maintenance at Bed, Board and Cloathing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Children from Seven till Fifteen Years old; when, according to their Genius and Capacity, &s;ome are &s;ent to the Univer|&s;ity, or apprenticed out to Trades; for which there is a Provi&s;ion, which, including the Maintenance of the Ho&s;pital, amounts to 250<HI>l.</HI> a Year. A noble and well cho&s;en Piece of Charity.</P>
<P>We turned Ea&s;t to <HI>Selby,</HI> &s;ituate on the South Side of the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, but very well inhabited, and is famous for giving Birth to our <HI>Henry</HI> I. The <HI>Conqueror</HI> built an Abbey here,</P>
<P>We then fell down directly South, and came to <HI>Snath</HI> upon the <HI>Aire</HI>; which is but an incon&s;iderable Town; but, like <HI>Selby,</HI> has a pretty good Trade. I &s;hould have mention'd, that there are &s;everal Mer|chants that live at <HI>Selby</HI>; and that the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> is navi|gable up to the Town for large Ve&s;&s;els, and has a good Share of Trade that Way.</P>
<P>We fell down &s;till lower South, to <HI>Thorn</HI> on the River <HI>Dun,</HI> an indifferent Town, of no other Not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> than its Situation within the Mar&s;hes; which is
<PB N="170" REF="171">
called <HI>Mar&s;h-land I&s;land</HI>; for it is incompa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Dun,</HI> the <HI>Aire,</HI> the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and another little River, which parts it from the I&s;le of <HI>Axholm,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> already &s;poken of; &s;o that the&s;e Two River I&s;lands are contiguous.</P>
<P>Being now come to the Banks of the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> near the Influx of the <HI>Trent</HI> into the <HI>Humber,</HI> I &s;hall, after re|minding you, that I have now accompli&s;hed another Part of the Propo&s;ition in my la&s;t Letter, cro&s;s over the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> to <HI>Howdon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Howdon</HI> lies on the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> North, in the Ea&s;t|riding of <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> It is a pretty large Town, and is &s;ubject to great Inundations from the River, occa|&s;ioned by the Fre&s;hes which come down from the <HI>Woulds</HI>; and has been &s;o, it &s;eems, ever &s;ince 1390; when a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> built a very tall Steeple to the Church, that in ca&s;e of a &s;udden Inundation, the People might &s;ave them&s;elves in it.

<P>The Fair, or Mart, held here for Eight Days to|gether, is very con&s;iderable for Inland Trade, and &s;everal Whole&s;ale Trade&s;men come to it from <HI>London.</HI> But the Town is more famous for the Birth or Re&s;i|dence of one of our antient Hi&s;torians, <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Hoveden,</HI> or <HI>Howdon,</HI> a Monk of this Abbey. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s Continuator is mi&s;taken, in &s;aying this Town &s;tands upon the <HI>Derwent</HI>; for it is above Three Miles South-ea&s;t of it; tho' the <HI>Der|went</HI> was made navigable, pur&s;uant to Act of Par|liament, 1 <HI>Annae,</HI> to the <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> has a Temporal Juri&s;diction in this Part of the Country, which is called <HI>How|don&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>I found nothing in this low Part of the Country but a wonderful Conflux of great Rivers, all pour|ing down into the <HI>Humber,</HI> which receiving the <HI>Aire,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="172">
the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Dun,</HI> and the <HI>Trent,</HI> becomes rather a Sea than a River.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that the Middle of this Divi&s;ion of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> is very thin of Towns and People, being over&s;pread with <HI>Woulds,</HI> which are Plains and Downs, like tho&s;e of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> which feed great Numbers of Sheep, Black Cattle, and Hor&s;es, and produce Corn. The Northern Part, e&s;pecially, is more mountainous, which makes Part of the North-riding. But the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Parts are populous and rich, and full of Towns, the one lying on the Sea Coa&s;t, and the other upon the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> as above. The Sea Coa&s;t, or South-ea&s;t Side, is called <HI>Holderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we travelled North-ea&s;t up to <HI>Wighton,</HI> being but a very little out of the Way to <HI>Beverley.</HI> It is a &s;mall, but antient Market-town, &s;eated on the Banks of a little River called <HI>Foulne&s;s.</HI> Here are &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> as well as <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Antiquities. 'Tis &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Delgovitia</HI> Station of the <HI>Romans,</HI> from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Ddelw</HI> or <HI>Delgive,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>Image.</HI> Some have conjectured, that here has been a Temple of the <HI>Druids,</HI> and that their Groves were in the Wood of <HI>Dierwald,</HI> which they interpret as derived from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Derwen,</HI> an <HI>Oak.</HI></P>
<P>On the North-we&s;t of <HI>Wighton</HI> towards the <HI>Der|went,</HI> &s;tands the Market-town of <HI>Pocklington,</HI> which we were told was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it would not be worth our while to go &s;o much out of our Way to &s;ee it. So keeping on Ea&s;t under the <HI>Woulds,</HI> we arrived at <HI>Beverley,</HI> which is &s;ituate ju&s;t at the Foot of them, about a Mile from the River <HI>Hull.</HI> It is a large populous corporate Town, under the Govern|ment of a Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It takes its Name from the great Number of Beavers, with which that River abounded. It had formerly a con&s;iderable Trade, by means of a Creek, or Cut, commonly called <HI>Be|verley-beck,</HI> of old made from the Town to the River <HI>Hull,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Humber,</HI> for the Pa&s;&s;age of
<PB N="172" REF="173">
Ships and Boats, Keels, Wherries, Hoys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to and from the &s;aid Town; and as it had likewi&s;e divers Staiths or Landing-places adjoining to the &s;aid Beech, for the Lading and Unlading of all &s;orts of Merchan|dize, the Town was wont to receive no &s;mall Ad|vantage from this Cut or River. But there being no &s;ettled Fund for keeping it open, and clean&s;ing it, and the Expence of doing it being beyond the Ability of the Corporation, the &s;aid Beck was, in time, choaked up, and the Staiths grew out of Repair; whence an Act pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1727, for Clean&s;ing, Deepening and Widening the Creek, and for Repair|ing the Staiths, and for Mending the Roads leading from the &s;aid Cut to the Town; and at the &s;ame time providing for the Clean&s;ing of the Town it&s;elf: all which has had a very good Effect; for before, the Creek lying in the lower Part of the Town, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Filth, Dirt, and Soil of the Town was wa&s;hed int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, which very much contributed to choak it up.</P>
<P><HI>Beverley</HI> is the chief Town of the Ea&s;t-riding, and began to be of great Note from the Time that <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Beverly,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> the fir&s;t Doctor of Divinity in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Preceptor to Venerable <HI>Bede,</HI> built a Mona&s;tery here, and afterwards retired into it him&s;elf, where he died <HI>A.

It has all the Advantage, indeed, of a good Situation, to invite Gentlemen to re&s;ide in it; and being the neare&s;t Town of Note to the Centre of this Riding, the Se&s;&s;ions are always held here, in a &s;pacious and beautiful Hall, which has a publick Garden and Walks, not inferior to any of their kind in <HI>England.</HI> In this <HI>Hall-garth,</HI> as it is called, is a hand&s;ome Regi&s;ter-office for Deeds and Wills within this Divi&s;ion; which is the only County in <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> which has &s;uch a Regi&s;try; to the great Reproach of the Nation be it &s;aid, e&s;pecially when it &s;hall be remembered, that no le&s;s than two Bills (one for a Regi&s;try for the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> and another, after that, for a General Regi&s;try over the whole Kingdom) were re&s;pectively oppo&s;ed, and mi&s;carried very lately in Parliament.</P>
<P>Here are Two weekly Markets; one on <HI>Wedne&s;|days,</HI> for Cattle; the other on <HI>Saturdays,</HI> for Corn. The Market-place is as large as mo&s;t, having a beautiful Cro&s;s, &s;upported by Eight Free-&s;tone Co|lumns, of one intire Stone each, erected at the Charge of Sir <HI>Charles Hotham,</HI> and Sir <HI>Michael Wharton</HI>; upon which was this In&s;cription:

<P>The Common Gaol has been lately re-edified at a con&s;iderable Expence, the Windows well &s;a&s;hed; and, as if Works of Piety were more peculiarly adapted to this Place, there are Seven Alms-hou&s;es in the Town, and Legacies left for Two more;

<P>Here were formerly Four Churches, now only Two, but the large&s;t and fine&s;t Parochial ones in the Kingdom: <HI>viz.</HI> the late Collegiate Church of <HI>St. John the Evangeli&s;t,</HI> &s;till called the <HI>Min&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>St. Mary's.</HI> The Min&s;ter being very ruinous, a Brief was procured for the Repair of it in the Year 1710; the Produce of which, and the Sub&s;cription Money, being placed in the publick Funds, was farther augmented by the Ri&s;e of <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock, which enabled the prudent Managers to complete their pious De&s;ign in the mo&s;t beautiful manner, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Advice of that noted Architect <HI>Nicolas Hawk&s;more,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> King <HI>George</HI> I. encouraged this Work not only by a liberal Donation of Money, but of Stone likewi&s;e from the di&s;&s;olved Mona&s;tery of <HI>St. Mary's</HI> in <HI>York.</HI> Sir <HI>Michael Wharton</HI> gave in his Life-time 500<HI>l.</HI> and by Will 4000<HI>l.</HI> as a per|petual Fund towards keeping it in Repair.</P>
<P>The Choir is paved with Marble of Four different Colours, Lozenge-wi&s;e, appearing cubical to the Eye. Over the Altar is a large and magnificent wooden Arch curiou&s;ly engraven, &s;tanding upon Eight fluted Columns of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. The Altar-table is one intire Stone of white Marble, finely poli&s;hed; the Gift of Mr. <HI>Moy&s;er.</HI> The Ea&s;t Window is of painted Gla&s;s, collected out of the &s;everal Windows about the Church; but &s;o artfully joined, that they make throughout one regular and intire Figure. The Screen between the Choir and the Nef has been lately rebuilt of Roch-abbey Stone in the <HI>Gothick</HI> Style, and is de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed one of the chief Ornaments of the Church. The Body of the Church is paved with the &s;aid Stone intermixed with black Marble. The Pulpit,
<PB N="176" REF="177">
Reading-de&s;k, and Cover of the Font, are all new, and of excellent Workman&s;hip: the Galleries al&s;o are new, and beautifully fini&s;hed, &s;upported by Co|lumns of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order. But not the lea&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ing Thing in this Pile, is the North End Wall of the great cro&s;s Ayle, which hung over Three Feet and a half, but was &s;crewed up to its proper Level by the ingenious Contrivance of Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> who prepared an admirable Machine for the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 13th of <HI>September, Anno</HI> 1664, upon opening a Grave, they met with a Vault of &s;quare Free Stone 15 Feet long, and Two Feet broad: within it was a Sheet of Lead Four Feet long, and in that the A&s;hes, and Six Beads, (whereof Three crumbled to Du&s;t with a Touch; of the Three re|maining, Two were &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Cornelian</HI>) with Three great Bra&s;s Pins, and Four large Iron Nails. Upon the Sheet lay a leaden Plate, with this In&s;cri|ption, in Capital Letters:

<Q>In the Year of the Lord's Incarnation 1188, in <HI>September,</HI> the Night after the Fe&s;tival of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> the Apo&s;tle, this Church was con&s;umed by Fire: and in the Year 1197, on the 10th of <HI>March,</HI> Search was made for the Reliques of St. <HI>John</HI> in this Place; and the&s;e Bones were found in the Ea&s;tern Part of the

Sepulchre, and here depo&s;ited; and a Mixture of Du&s;t and Mortar was found in the &s;ame Place, and depo&s;ited.</Q></P>
<P>Over this lay a Box of Lead about Seven Inches long, Six broad. and Five deep, wherein were &s;everal Pieces of Bones mixed with a little Du&s;t, and yield|ing a &s;weet Smell. All the&s;e Things were carefully re-interred in the Middle Ayle of the Body of the Min&s;ter, with this In&s;cription added, in Capital Letters:
<Q><HI>Reliquiae eaedem effo&s;&s;ae, et ibidem compo&s;itae, fornice lateritio dignabantur</HI> XXVI. <HI>die men&s;is Martii, Anno Domini</HI> MDCCXXVI; <HI>quando</HI> v. <HI>te&s;&s;elatum eccle&s;iae hujus pavimentum primo fuit in&s;tauratum.</HI></Q> <HI>Thus</HI> Engli&s;h'd:
<Q>The &s;ame Reliques which were dug up, and re|placed, were adorned with an Arch of Brick-work, on the 26th Day of <HI>March</HI> 1726; when the Fifth te&s;&s;elated Pavement of this Church was fir&s;t repaired.</Q></P>
<P>Over it, directly upon the Roof, is an In&s;cription, to &s;hew where the Reliques are interr'd.</P>
<P>In this Church are &s;everal Monuments of the <HI>Piercies,</HI> Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who have added a little Chapel to the Choir. On the Right Side of the Altar-place &s;tands the Freed-&s;tool, mentioned above, made of one intire Stone, and &s;aid to have been removed from <HI>Dunbar</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with a Well of Water behind it. At the upper End of the Body of the Church, next the Choir, hangs an an|tient Table with the Picture of St. <HI>John</HI> the Evan|geli&s;t, (from whom the Church is named) and of King <HI>Athel&s;tan,</HI> the Founder of it, and between them this Di&s;tich:
<Q><PB N="178" REF="179">
<L><HI>Als free make I thee,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As Heart can wi&s;h, or Egh can &s;ee.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In the Body of the Church &s;tands an antient Monu|ment, which they call the <HI>Virgins Tomb</HI>; becau&s;e Two Virgin Si&s;ters lay buried there, who gave the Town a Piece of Land, into which any Freeman may put Three Milch Kine from <HI>Lady-day</HI> to <HI>Michaelmas.</HI> At the lower End of the Body of the Church, &s;tands a fair large Font of Agat Stone.</P>
<P>The principal Trade of the Town is making Malt, Oat-meal, and tann'd Leather; but the poor People mo&s;tly &s;upport them&s;elves by working Bone-lace, which of late has met with particular Encourage|ment, the Children being maintained at School to learn to read, and to work this Sort of Lace. The Clothing-trade was formerly followed in this Town; but <HI>Leland</HI> tells us, that even in his Time it was very much decayed.</P>
<P>They have &s;everal Fairs, but one more e&s;pecially remarkable, called the <HI>Mart,</HI> beginning about Nine Days before <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-day,</HI> and kept in a Street lead|ing to the <HI>Min&s;ter Garth,</HI> called <HI>Londoners-&s;treet</HI>; for the <HI>Londoners</HI> bring down their Wares, and furni&s;h the Country Trade&s;men by Whole&s;ale.</P>
<P>About a Mile from <HI>Beverly</HI> to the Ea&s;t, in a Pa&s;ture belonging to the Town, is a kind of <HI>Spaw,</HI> tho' they &s;ay it cannot be judged by the Ta&s;te, whe|ther it comes from any Mineral, or not; yet taken inwardly, it is a great Drier, and bathed in, dries &s;corbutick Scurf, and all Sorts of Scabs, and al&s;o very much helps again&s;t the King's Evil.</P>
<P>From <HI>Beverley</HI> I came to <HI>Hull</HI> (properly called <HI>King&s;ton upon Hull</HI>) Di&s;tance Six Miles. If you would have an Idea of <HI>Hamburgh, Dantzick, Rot|terdam,</HI> or any of the &s;econd Cities abroad, which are famed for their Commerce, you may vi&s;it this Town. It is not indeed &s;o large as tho&s;e; but, in
<PB N="179" REF="180">
proportion to the Dimen&s;ions of it, I believe more Bu&s;ine&s;s is done in <HI>Hull,</HI> than in any Town in <HI>Eu|rope. Liverpoole</HI> of late comes very near it; but it has not the Advantage of a <HI>London</HI> Trade, which <HI>Hull</HI> has.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t War, the Fleets from <HI>Hull</HI> to <HI>London</HI> were frequently 100 Sail; &s;ometimes, including the other Creeks in the <HI>Humber,</HI> 160 Sail at a time; and to <HI>Holland</HI> their Trade was &s;o con&s;iderable, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> always imployed Two Men of War to convoy the Merchant-men to and from <HI>Hull,</HI> and tho&s;e were as many as they &s;ent to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, all the Trade at <HI>Leeds, Wakefield,</HI> and <HI>Halifax,</HI> of which I have &s;poken &s;o particularly, is negotiated here. All the Lead Trade of <HI>Derby&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> from <HI>Bautry</HI> Wharf; the Butter of the Ea&s;t and North-riding brought down the <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> to <HI>York</HI>; the Chee&s;e down the <HI>Trent</HI> from <HI>Stafford, Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire</HI>; and the Corn, from all the Counties adjacent, are &s;hipped off here.</P>
<P>So again, they &s;upply all the&s;e Countries with foreign Goods, for which they trade to all Parts of the known World; nor have the Merchants of any Port in <HI>Britain</HI> greater Credit, or a fairer Character, than the Merchants of <HI>Hull,</HI> as well for the Ju&s;tice of their Dealings, as the Greatne&s;s of their Sub&s;tance. From <HI>Norway,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick, Dantzick, Riga, Narva,</HI> and <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> they make large Returns in Iron, Copper, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> Linen and Yarn, and other Things; all which they get Vend for in the Country in prodigious Quantities. They have al&s;o a great Importation of Wine, Linen, Oil, Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Holland, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> The Trade of Tobacco and Sugars from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they chiefly manage by the Way of <HI>London.</HI> But be&s;ides all this, their Export of Corn, as well to <HI>London</HI> as to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> exceeds all of the
<PB N="180" REF="181">
Kind that is or can be at any Port in <HI>England, London</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>Their Shipping is a great Article, in which they exceed all the Towns and Ports on that Coa&s;t, except <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> &s;aving that their Shipping con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els than the Coal-trade is &s;upplied with, tho' they have a great many large Ve&s;&s;els too, which are imployed in their foreign Trade.</P>
<P>The Town is &s;ituated at the Mouth of the River <HI>Hull,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Humber,</HI> and where the <HI>Humber</HI> opens into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean; &s;o that one Side of the Town lies upon the Sea, the other upon the Land. This makes the Situation naturally very &s;trong; and, were there occa&s;ion, it is capable of being made impregnable, by rea&s;on of the low Grounds round it.</P>
<P>The Advantages of this Situation &s;truck King <HI>Edward</HI> I. as he was riding a hunting, after his Return from the Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Year 1296. Upon which he immediately granted &s;everal Privi|leges and Immunities to tho&s;e who would build and &s;ettle here, erected a Manor-hall him&s;elf, and fitted up an Harbour, from whence it received the Name of <HI>Kings-town.</HI> It held out again&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who went in Per&s;on to demand it, when Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> told his Maje&s;ty,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He kept it for the Par|liament again&s;t him."</Q>
Yet both the <HI>Hothams. viz.</HI> Father and Son, lo&s;t their Heads by that very Parliament.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. on occa&s;ion of the frequent <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars in his Reign, had once re&s;olved to ap|point a Station for a Squadron of Men of War here, with a Yard and Dock for building Ships; and on this Occa&s;ion, re&s;olved to make the Place &s;trong in pro|portion to what tho&s;e Affairs required: upon which a large Citadel was marked out on the other Side of the River; but it was never fini&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">The Town is exceeding clo&s;e built, and populous, even to an Inconvenience, having really no room to extend it&s;elf by Buildings. There are but Two Churches, <HI>Trinity</HI> and <HI>St. Mary's</HI>; the former is very large, in which is a fine Altar-piece by <HI>Par|mentier</HI>; the latter is thought to have been once larger than it is. King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. u&s;ed it as his Chapel Royal, and with the &s;ame Freedom; for this Defender of the Faith, and Protector of the Church, pulled down the Steeple, becau&s;e it &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the Place where he re&s;ided. The Inhabitants after|wards built it up again at their own Expence.</P>
<P>They &s;hew us &s;till, in their Town-hall, the Figure of a Northern Fi&s;herman, &s;uppo&s;ed to be of <HI>Green|land.</HI> He was taken up at Sea in a Leathern Boat, which he &s;at in, and was covered with Skins, which drew together about his Wai&s;t, &s;o that the Boat could not take in Water, and he could not &s;ink. The Creature would neither feed, nor &s;peak, and &s;o died.</P>
<P>They have a very hand&s;ome Exchange here, where the Merchants from foreign Countries, and others from the different Parts of the Kingdom, meet, as at <HI>London.</HI> The Bu&s;ine&s;s ari&s;ing from the Navigation of all the great Rivers which fall into the <HI>Humber,</HI> is tran&s;acted here. There is al&s;o a fine Free-&s;chool founded by <HI>John Alcock,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> after|wards of <HI>Ely,</HI> who was born at <HI>Beverley,</HI> but cho&s;e to extend his Liberality to this Place. Over the School is the Merchant's Hall.</P>
<P>But the Trinity Hou&s;e here is the Glory of the Town. It is a Corporation of it&s;elf, compo&s;ed of a Society of Merchants.

<P>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the River <HI>Hull,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 14 Arches. A <HI>Greenland</HI> Fi&s;hery, &s;et up in this Town, went on with Succe&s;s for a while, but it decayed in the Time of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars; and the Hou&s;e built by the <HI>Greenland</HI> Mer|chants is now turned into Granaries for Corn, and Warehou&s;es for other Goods.</P>
<P>The old Ho&s;pital, call'd GOD'S HOUSE, &s;tands near it, with a Chapel; both which were pulled down in the Civil Wars 1643, but were rebuilt in 1673; and the Arms of the <HI>de la Poles,</HI> being found among the Ruins, were placed over the Door of the Ho&s;pital, with this In&s;cription:
<Q>DEO ET PAVPERIBVS POSVIT<LB>MICHAEL DE LA POLE, 1384.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Michael</HI> was the Son of <HI>William de la Pole,</HI> &s;ometime a Merchant at <HI>Raven&s;purn,</HI> formerly a flouri&s;hing Town of Trade at the Mouth of the <HI>Humber</HI>; but being removed to this new Town of <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. gave that King a magnificent Entertainment, when, in the Sixth Year of his Reign, he came to take a View of the Place; upon which our Merchant was knighted. The King afterwards, going into <HI>Flanders</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> met Sir <HI>William</HI> at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where he &s;up|plied
<PB N="183" REF="184">
him with &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Pounds, and even mortgaged his E&s;tate for his Royal Ma&s;ter's U&s;e. Such Services could not go unrewarded from &s;o generous, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a Prince. He made him Knight Banneret in the Field, &s;ettled on him and his Heirs Lands at <HI>King&s;ton</HI> to the Value of 500 Marks a Year, and upon his Return into <HI>England</HI> increa&s;ed them to 1000, and advanced him in Time to be Chief Baron of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> died about 1356, after he had begun a Mona&s;tery here for the <HI>Carthu&s;ians.</HI> His Son, Sir <HI>Michael,</HI> who, 6 <HI>Richard</HI> II. was made Lord Chan|cellor, not only fini&s;hed it, but founded likewi&s;e the Ho&s;pital called GOD'S HOUSE, above-mentioned. He built moreover a &s;tately Palace, called the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI>'s, which Honour he obtained in Right of his Wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> elde&s;t Daughter of Sir <HI>John Wingfield,</HI> who married the Heire&s;s of <HI>Gilbert Gran|ville,</HI> Earl of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> But the Happine&s;s of him, and his Family, being now arrived to the Height, &s;et in Misfortunes; for in the Year 1388, he was impeached of High Trea&s;on, and fled for his Life into <HI>France,</HI> where he died. <HI>William de la Pole</HI> was Prime Mini&s;ter to King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and &s;u&s;pected to be too familiar with his heroick Queen. He was impeached by the Commons, <HI>Anno</HI> 1450, and ba|ni&s;hed; but his Head was &s;truck off by the Manage|ment of his Enemies, as &s;oon as he &s;et his Foot on the <HI>French</HI> Shore.</P>
<P><HI>John de la Pole</HI> married the Si&s;ter of King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> IV. and &s;o became allied to Royal Blood, and, by that means, expo&s;ed to various Misfortunes; and the famous Cardinal <HI>Pol&eacute;,</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. de&s;cended from that Marriage.</P>

The Villages lie very thick, but I met with nothing of Note till we came up to <HI>Horn&s;ey,</HI> which is almo&s;t &s;urrounded with a little Arm of the Sea. The Steeple here is a notable Sea-mark, but is much fallen into Ruin. Here was a whole Street wa&s;h'd away by the Sea, as, 'tis &s;aid, a Village called <HI>Hide</HI> was, a little to the North, as well as many other Villages on this Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>North-we&s;t of <HI>Horn&s;ey,</HI> &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Sea, &s;tands <HI>Kilham,</HI> a Market-town in the <HI>Woulds,</HI> but of no Note.</P>
<P>We next come to <HI>Burlington,</HI> or <HI>Birdlington,</HI> a good large Market-town, &s;ituate on a Creek of the Sea. It is a Place of good Trade, and has a &s;afe Harbour for Ships, and a good Quay to load and unload them. It is much frequented by the Colliers. The Harbour is made &s;till better, and yet improving, by virtue of &s;everal Acts of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed for Repair of its Piers, the la&s;t of which, inforcing the former, and &s;upplying Defects, was in 1723. Here <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newborough,</HI> (a Village ju&s;t by) one of our Hi&s;torians, was a Canon Regular, and re&s;ided, when he fell &s;o violently upon <HI>Geoffrey</HI> of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, and treated him very abu&s;ively, which <HI>Leland</HI> blames him very much for, as irre|verent and uncharitable to a Bi&s;hop after his Death.
<PB N="186" REF="187">
It &s;eems there was a per&s;onal Enmity between <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and &s;ome of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Family; tho' the la&s;t is in no wi&s;e to be ju&s;tified in &s;ome of his fictitious A&s;&s;ertions, no more than the other is for ab&s;olutely denying there was &s;uch a Man as King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and that the Ground at <HI>Battle Abbey,</HI> where <HI>Harold</HI> was &s;lain in fighting again&s;t the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> always &s;weats Blood after Rain.</P>
<P>The Country People told us a Story here of <HI>Gip&s;ies,</HI> which vi&s;it them often in a &s;urpri&s;ing Man|ner. We were &s;trangely amu&s;ed with their Di&s;|cour&s;e at fir&s;t, forming our Ideas from the Word, which, in ordinary Signification with us, denotes a Sort of &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lling Vagabonds. But we were &s;oon made to under&s;tand, that the People meant by them cer|tain Streams of Water, which at different Sea&s;ons (for none knows when they will happen) gu&s;h out of the Earth with great Violence and Noi&s;e, &s;pout|ing up to a great Height, being natural <HI>Jette d' Eaux,</HI> or Fountains, which afterwards joining together, form little Rivers, and &s;o ha&s;ten to the Sea. I had not time to examine into the Particulars; and as the Irruption was not ju&s;t then to be &s;een, we could &s;ay little to it. That which was mo&s;t ob&s;ervable to us, was, that the Country People have a Notion, that whenever tho&s;e <HI>Gip&s;ies,</HI> or, as &s;ome call them, <HI>Vip&s;ies,</HI> break out, there will certainly en&s;ue either Famine or Plague. This puts me in mind, that the very &s;ame thing is &s;aid to happen at <HI>Swintham</HI> Bot|tom in <HI>Surrey,</HI> beyond <HI>Croydon,</HI> and that the Water gu&s;hing out of the chalky Hills about eight Miles from <HI>Croydon,</HI> on the Road to <HI>Ryegate,</HI> fills the whole Bottom, and makes a large River, running ju&s;t to the Town's End of <HI>Croydon</HI>; and then turning to the Left, runs into the River, which ri&s;es in the Town, and &s;o to <HI>Ca&s;halton.</HI> I mention it, becau&s;e the Country People here have exactly the &s;ame Notion, that this Water never breaks out but again&s;t a Fa|mine;
<PB N="187" REF="188">
and as I am &s;ure it has not now broken out for more than 60 Years, it may, for aught I know, be true.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Burlington</HI> &s;tands <HI>Flamborough-head,</HI> a little Promontory, which bends a little into the Sea, and forms the Bay of <HI>Burlington.</HI> It takes its Name from <HI>Flam,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word for a Fire-light; and not far from this Promontory is a very large Ditch, which &s;ome of the antient Earls of <HI>Holderne&s;s</HI> threw up as a Boundary to their Juri&s;diction and E&s;tate. It is call'd <HI>Earls Dyke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Humanby</HI> &s;tands next, but is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it has lo&s;t the Privilege of its Market, if it ever had any.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lebber&s;ton,</HI> a little Village, a &s;mall Way from the Sea, the famous River <HI>Derwent</HI> takes its Ri&s;e, and makes its Way We&s;t, in&s;tead of running into the Sea here. And here I take Leave of the <HI>Ea&s;t-riding,</HI> which is in no wi&s;e &s;o fruitful as the other two Ridings, by rea&s;on that the middle Part of it is over-run with the <HI>Woulds</HI>; which are high Grounds, barren and moori&s;h; but are however well-&s;tock'd with Sheep: yet the Ea&s;tern Part upon the Sea is fruitful and plea&s;ant, which, as well as the Southern Part, produces all Sort of Grain and Gra&s;s. But then, if you take in its Trade and Traffick, it excels both the other Ridings.</P>
<P><HI>Scarborough</HI> is the fir&s;t Town we come to upon the Coa&s;t in the <HI>North-riding</HI>: it is a Borough Baili|wick Town, the Situation of which is perfectly ro|mantick; bending in the Form of a Cre&s;cent to the main Ocean, of which you have almo&s;t an unbound|ed Pro&s;pect from all Parts, it being built on a &s;teep Rock, and the Declivity of a lofty Hill, on the Top of which &s;tood an antient Ca&s;tle, founded by <HI>William le Gros,</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and repaired and inlarg'd afterwards by King <HI>Henry</HI> II. but de|moli&s;hed in the late Civil Wars. The Summit of this
<PB N="188" REF="189">
Hill contains no le&s;s than 18 or 20 Acres of Mea|dow-ground. The Town is populous, almo&s;t incom|pa&s;&s;ed by the Sea, and walled where it joins not to the Ca&s;tle, or is more &s;trongly defended by the Sea. It has one of the be&s;t Harbours in the Kingdom, e&s;pecially &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of an Act of Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> 1732, to inlarge its Piers and Harbour, by which they have gained 6 Feet Depth of Water, which enables the Harbour to receive Ve&s;&s;els of greater Burden than it could do before. And it is the be&s;t Place, between <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and the <HI>Humber</HI> capable of receiving in Di&s;tre&s;s of Weather Ships coming from the Ea&s;tern Seas along our Northern Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters (who&s;e admirable Virtues yearly occa&s;ion a great Concour&s;e of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom) were fir&s;t di&s;covered by Mrs. <HI>Ferrow</HI> about 120 Years ago, then an Inhabit|ant of the Place.</P>
<P>They are reckoned Cathartick and Diuretick, <HI>much in their Nature like tho&s;e of</HI> Pyrmont <HI>in</HI> Germany, and are apparently tinged with a Collection of Mi|neral Salts, as of Vitriol, Alum, Iron, and perhaps Sulphur; but being deemed of the &s;ame Nature as tho&s;e of <HI>Cheltenham</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> before de&s;crib'd, I refer to them.</P>
<P><HI>Scarborough</HI> may be &s;aid even to rival the <HI>Bath</HI> it|&s;elf, and, on &s;everal Accounts, is more eligible and in|viting to Strangers. It is well for the <HI>Bath,</HI> that its Sea&s;ons interfere not with theirs; for it is fre|quented chiefly in the hot Months of the Summer.</P>
<P>There are many new Buildings in it; and more going forward, &s;o that there is now good Accom|modation for great Numbers even of the highe&s;t Quality; and they have A&s;&s;emblies and Publick Balls, in long Rooms built on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Accident that happen'd in <HI>De|cember</HI> 1737, whereby this famous <HI>Spaw</HI> had like to
<PB N="189" REF="190">
have been lo&s;t, de&s;erves to be mentioned here. Take then the Account as follows:</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaw,</HI> as to its Situation, lay South from the Town, on the Sands, and fronting the Sea to the Ea&s;t, under a high Cliff on the Back of it, We&s;t; the Top of the Cliff being above the High-water Level, 54 Yards; and all about a Quarter of a Mile from the Town.</P>
<P>The Staith or Wharf adjoining to the Spaw-hou&s;e, was a large Body of Stone, bound by Timbers, and was a Fence again&s;t the Sea, for the Security of the Hou&s;e; it was 76 Feet long, and 14 Feet high, and in Weight by Computation 2463 Tons. The Hou&s;e and Buildings were upon a Level with the Staith; at the North End of which, and near adjoining to it, upon a &s;mall Ri&s;e above the level Sands, and at the Foot of the Stairs that lead up to the Top of the &s;aid Staith, and to the Hou&s;e, were the <HI>Spaw</HI> Wells.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day, December</HI> 28, in the Morning, a great Crack was heard from the Cellar of the <HI>Spaw</HI> Hou&s;e, and upon Search, the Cellar was found rent; but at the Time, no farther Notice was taken of it.</P>
<P>The Night following, another Crack was heard; and in the Morning, the Inhabitants were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;trange Po&s;ture it &s;tood in, and got &s;everal Gentlemen to view it, who being of Opinion the Hou&s;e could not &s;tand long, advi&s;ed them to get out their Goods; but they &s;till continued in it.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> following, between Two and Three in the Afternoon, another Crack was heard, and the Top of the Cliff behind it rent 224 Yards in Length, and 36 in Breadth, and was all in Motion, &s;lowly de&s;cending; and &s;o continued till dark. The Ground thus rent, contained about an Acre of Pa&s;ture-land, and had Cattle then feeding upon it, and was on a Level with the main Land, but &s;unk near 17 Yards perpendicular. The Sides of the Cliff neare&s;t the <HI>Spaw</HI> &s;tood as before, but were rent and broken in
<PB N="190" REF="191">
many Places, and forced forwards to the Sea. The Ground, when &s;unk, lay upon a Level, and the Cattle next Morning were &s;till feeding on it, the main Land being as a Wall on the We&s;t, and &s;ome Part of the Side of the Cliff as a Wall to the Ea&s;t; but the Whole, to View, gave &s;uch a confu&s;ed Pro|&s;pect, as could hardly be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The Rent of the Top of the Cliff afore&s;aid, from the main Land, was 224 Yards. The Rent con|tinued from each End, down the Side of the Cliff, to the Sands, was mea&s;ured on the Sands from one End to the other, 168 Yards; <HI>viz.</HI> 143 South of the Staith and <HI>Spaw</HI> Wells, and 100 to the North of the <HI>Spaw.</HI></P>
<P>As the Ground &s;unk, the Earth, or Sand, on which the People u&s;ed to walk under the Cliff, ro&s;e upwards out of its natural Po&s;ition, for above 100 Yards in Length, on each Side of the Staith, North and South; and was in &s;ome Places &s;ix, and in others &s;even Yards above its former Level. The <HI>Spaw</HI> Wells ro&s;e with it; but as &s;oon as it began to ri&s;e, the Water at the <HI>Spaw</HI> Well ceas'd run|ning, and was gone.</P>
<P>The Ground thus ri&s;en was 26 Yards broad; the Staith, which was computed at 2463 Tons, ro&s;e intire and whole, 12 Feet higher than its former Po|&s;ition, (but rent a little in the Front) and was forced forwards towards the Sea, 20 Yards.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t rea&s;onable Account then given for this Phaenomenon, and the Occa&s;ion of the De&s;truction of the Staith, and <HI>Spaw</HI> Hou&s;e, and the Lo&s;s for &s;ome time of the <HI>Spaw</HI> Spring, is as follows:</P>
<P>When this Staith, or Wharf, was lately rebuilt, (it being thrown down by the Violence of the Sea) Mr. <HI>Vincent,</HI> Engineer for the building of the new Pier at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> was de&s;ir'd to rebuild this Staith at the <HI>Spaw</HI>; and digging a Trench to lay the Foundation thereof, with great Difficulty clear'd it
<PB N="191" REF="192">
of Water; and when he had done it, could, at &s;eve|ral Parts thereof, very ea&s;ily thru&s;t his Stick or Cane up to the Handle; from whence it is concluded, that all the Earth under the Staith was of a porous, &s;pongy, &s;wampy Nature, and was much the &s;ame below the Foundation of the <HI>Spaw</HI> Hou&s;e, and all under the Sides of the Cliff adjoining, as well North as South.</P>
<P>Allowing this to be Fact, the &s;olid Earth &s;inking on the Top of the Cliff, as afore-mention'd, (which was of &s;o va&s;t a Weight, as by Computation to amount to 261, 360 Tons) pre&s;&s;ing gradually upon and into the &s;wampy, boggy Earth beneath it, would of cour&s;e, and did, rai&s;e the Earth and Sands as before noticed, and &s;o effected the Mi&s;chief we have particulariz'd.</P>
<P>But, very luckily for the Town, after a diligent Search, and clearing away the Ruins, as we may &s;ay, they found again the <HI>Spaw</HI> Spring; and on Trial, had the Plea&s;ure to find the Water rather better'd than impair'd by the Di&s;a&s;ter. And now the Whole is in a more flouri&s;hing Condition than ever.</P>
<P>Here is &s;uch plenty of all Sorts of Fi&s;h, that I have hardly &s;een the like. To de&s;cribe the Herring, the Cod, the Whiting, is only to repeat what is &s;aid in other Places, and what we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to repeat, more than once, now we begin to go far North.</P>
<P>We travelled a long Way from <HI>Scarborough,</HI> before we came to the next Market-town, which is <HI>Whitby,</HI> &s;ituate at the Influx of the little River <HI>E&s;k,</HI> into the Sea. It has an excellent Harbour, and a good Trade by Sea, and 'tis &s;aid to have above 200 Ships be|longing to it. Here are built a great Number of good Ships for the Coal Trade. It hath a good Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. The Market is well furni&s;h'd, and &s;upply'd with all Sorts of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">The Harbour and Piers being &s;omewhat decay'd they were repair'd by virtue of Two Acts of Parlia|ment, in the Fir&s;t and Seventh Years of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>; and in 1733, an Act pa&s;s'd to pre&s;erve, con|tinue, and keep the &s;aid Piers in Repair for ever.</P>
<P>By means of the&s;e &s;everal Acts of Parliament, the Piers of <HI>Whitby</HI> have been rebuilt and completed; but yet for &s;ome Years pa&s;t the Entrance into the Port has been rendered very narrow and difficult, by rea&s;on of a Bank of Sand, which has been gather|ing about the Head of the We&s;t Pier, in&s;omuch that it bid fair to choak up the Harbour; nor could this Inconvenience be redre&s;s'd in the Opinion of the be&s;t Judges, but by lengthening and extending the We&s;t Pier, and its Head, about 100 Yards farther into the Sea. For this Rea&s;on another Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Eighth of King <HI>George</HI> II. for lengthening the We&s;t Pier, and for improving the Harbour.</P>
<P>At the Foot of &s;ome Rocks, at this Town, have been found Stones naturally as round as a Bullet, which when broken, &s;tony Serpents are found in them, for the mo&s;t part headle&s;s, look'd upon as a <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae.</HI></P>
<P>This Place was antiently called <HI>Strean&s;hall,</HI> and <HI>O&s;wy</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> held a Council here, in 663, to determine the Controver&s;y between tho&s;e who kept <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> after the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manner, and tho&s;e who kept it after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, which <HI>Augu|&s;tine</HI> the Monk had lately introduced. After the Party for the fir&s;t had &s;poken, the other an&s;wering, in&s;i&s;ted they kept <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> after the manner of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> on whom Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to build his Church, and had the Keys of Heaven. Upon which the King a&s;k'd, If it was true, that Chri&s;t had &s;poken &s;o to St. <HI>Peter?</HI> Which the adver&s;e Party allowing, the King &s;wore a great Oath, That he would not di&s;oblige this Porter of Heaven, le&s;t, when he came to the Gates, he &s;hould remember him: and
<PB N="193" REF="194">
&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Celebration of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> after the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Manner.</P>
<P>Near this Place are &s;ome Alum Mines, belonging to her Grace the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Bucks,</HI> in which there is carry'd on a very con&s;iderable Trade.</P>
<P>We inquir'd as to that &s;trange and wonderful Phe|nomenon relating to the Air here, which, as the wild Gee&s;e fly over a Piece of Ground near this Place, in hard Winters, to the Lakes in the Southern Coun|tries, makes them drop down all of a &s;udden to the Ground; and had it a&s;&s;ur'd to us for Truth, though none could a&s;&s;ign any Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters at <HI>Whitby,</HI> which have had great Reputation. Several curious and antique Coins have been dug up in this Neighbourhood; and a Mona&s;tery was founded here by St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> about the Year 650; and being de&s;troyed by the <HI>Danes,</HI> was afterwards rebuilt: the Ruins of which (very con&s;iderable) are &s;till to be &s;een. In the Month of <HI>November</HI> 1710, &s;uch a dreadful Storm happen'd here, that the Damage to the Shipping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was computed at 40,000<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Coa&s;t inclines North-we&s;t, and we fol|lowed it till we came to <HI>Gi&s;borough,</HI> a Market-town pretty well built, a little way from the Sea, upon a &s;mall namele&s;s River. It is a fine and delicious Situation, endued with &s;uch a grateful Variety and Advantages of Nature, as renders it mo&s;t delightfully plea&s;ant: a fine Scene of Verdure over&s;preads all the Grounds about it, which are deck'd with Plenty of Field-flowers, almo&s;t all the Year round. Some compare it to <HI>Puteoli</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> but allow that it exceeds it in Healthine&s;s. It &s;tands high, and would have been incommoded with cold Breezes (as it &s;tands &s;o Northerly) from the Sea, but that &s;ome Hills conveniently interfere, &s;o as to qualify the Cold.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">The Behaviour of the Inhabitants too participates of the Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Place; for they are very courteous, well-bred, and obliging, and very neat and cleanly in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Here are likewi&s;e &s;ome Alum Mines, but not &s;o con&s;iderable and ea&s;y wrought as tho&s;e of <HI>Whitby,</HI> which has taken off a great Part of that Trade from hence.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ant Town is the la&s;t on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide towards the Sea, in this <HI>North-riding,</HI> in our Way to <HI>Durham.</HI> It made &s;o delightful an Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind, that I left the whole County in gene|ral, but this Place, and truly plea&s;urable Country about it, in particular, with Regret.</P>
<P>And thus have I accompli&s;h'd the third and la&s;t Part of my Propo&s;ition, with re&s;pect to my Circuit through this large and far extended County: and though I have been not a little circum&s;tantial in my Accounts of it, yet there are many curious Matters, that &s;till remain untouch'd, and could not be brought within the Compa&s;s of an Epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pondence of this kind.</P>
<P>But as I have given you only a De&s;cription of the County above Ground, take the following Memo|randums of the Trea&s;ures which are contained in its Bowels:</P>
<P>Alum, Jet, or Black Amber, Copperas, Marble, Pit-coal, Lead, Copper, Lime&s;tone, and Kelp.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Market-town we come to in the Bi&s;hop|rick of <HI>Durham,</HI> on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, is <HI>Stockton,</HI> which lies on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Teis.</HI> It has ri&s;en, at the Expence of <HI>Yarum,</HI> from a poor pitiful Village, with Clay Walls and Straw Covering to the Hou&s;es, to a well-built Corporate Town, of great Re&s;ort and Bu&s;ine&s;s, govern'd by a Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis famous for its Ale, and a good Trade, which it carries on in
<PB N="195" REF="196">
Lead and Butter, by the <HI>Teis,</HI> with <HI>London,</HI> which formerly was altogether at <HI>Yarum.</HI> But this Town lying nearer the Sea, and con&s;equently more conve|nient, has almo&s;t engro&s;s'd the whole Trade to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Coa&s;ting along the Sea-&s;ide, we come next to <HI>Hartlepool,</HI> which is a famous corporate Mayor-town, and &s;eated on a little Promontory, which juts out into the Sea, with which it is encompa&s;s'd on all Sides, except the We&s;t. The Market was much more con&s;iderable formerly than now; and its chief Sub&s;i&s;tence ri&s;es only from its good Harbour, which frequently receives the Coal-fleet from <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in bad Weather.</P>
<P>We turn'd from hence to the Left North-we&s;t, and came to <HI>Durham</HI> next, which is a fine City, pretty large, compact, well-contriv'd, and well &s;ituated, high, plea&s;ant, and healthy, and &s;urrounded almo&s;t with the River <HI>Were,</HI> over which are two good Stone Bridges. The Ca&s;tle &s;tands on an Eminence, with which the River inclo&s;es the City; as the Ca&s;tle does al&s;o the Cathedral, the Bi&s;hop's Palace, and the fine Hou&s;es of the Clergy, where they live in great Splendor and Magnificence. All Sorts of Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniencies for Life, are very cheap, as well as very good, here, tho' it has but one weekly Market, which is kept in a large &s;pacious Area in the Town. It is govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and Sheriffs, and has &s;ix Pari&s;h Churches, be&s;ides the Cathedral, which is very noble and magnificent, adorn'd with a high Tower, which ri&s;es from the Mid&s;t of it, and two Spires at the We&s;t End.</P>
<P>Thus from a poor Oratory of wreathen Wands and Hurdles, with which the indigent Monks of <HI>Landisfarn</HI> had fir&s;t built it, it is become one of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous Buildings of the Kind in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="197">
and was erected out of the Offerings which were made by the &s;uper&s;titious Multitude at the Shrine of St. <HI>Cuthbert.</HI> And yet, notwith&s;tanding the Re&s;i|dence of &s;o many dignified Prote&s;tant Clergy, 'tis &s;aid, there are &s;till great Numbers of <HI>Roman Catho|licks</HI> in this City.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> is a Temporal Prince, that he keeps a Court of Equity, and al&s;o Courts of Ju&s;tice in ordinary Cau&s;es, within him&s;elf. He is &s;till Earl of <HI>Sadberg,</HI> and takes Place as Bi&s;hop immediately after the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London.</HI> As the Country about <HI>Rome</HI> is called St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Pa|trimony, &s;o that about <HI>Durham</HI> is St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI>'s, to whom the Church is dedicated, as 'tis &s;aid it was founded by the Monks of <HI>Landisfarn. David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> laying all Wa&s;te with Fire and Sword, while King <HI>Edward</HI> III. was at <HI>Calais, Zouch,</HI> the valiant Bi&s;hop, fought the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Nevil's Cro&s;s,</HI> where they were cut in Pieces, and their King taken Pri&s;oner. He was the &s;ixth Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landisfarn,</HI> or <HI>Holy I&s;land,</HI> from whence the See was removed hither.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hoprick is e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t in <HI>Eng|land</HI>; and the Prebends, and other Church Livings, in the Gift of the Bi&s;hop, are the riche&s;t in the Kingdom. They told me there, that the Bi&s;hop had thirteen Livings in his Gift, from 300<HI>l.</HI> to 800<HI>l.</HI> a Year; and the Living of the little Town of <HI>Sedg|field,</HI> a few Miles South of the City, is &s;aid to be worth 700<HI>l.</HI> a Year, be&s;ides the &s;mall Tythes, which maintain a Curate, or might do &s;o.</P>
<P>This Church is very rich: they have excellent Mu&s;ick. The old Ve&s;tments, which the Clergy be|fore the Reformation wore, are &s;till us'd on <HI>Sundays</HI> and other Holy-days, by the Re&s;idents. They are &s;o rich with Embroidery and embo&s;s'd Work of Silver, as mu&s;t needs make it unea&s;y for the Wearers to &s;u&s;tain.

<P><PB N="197" REF="198">One of the old Bi&s;hops of <HI>Durham</HI> purcha&s;ed for a round Sum of Money all the Rights of the Pala|tinate, and other Juri&s;diction in this County from King <HI>Richard</HI> I. and, by his la&s;t Will, left them to the &s;ucceeding Bi&s;hops.

<P>The&s;e We&s;tern Parts of the County, all to the upper Part of it, are very hilly and mountainous, and the Fields near them look naked and barren; but the Iron Mines they produce within their Bowels, make ample Amends for the Barrenne&s;s of the Surface.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">We return'd from the&s;e inho&s;pitable Parts to <HI>Durham</HI>; from whence we kept the common Road to <HI>Che&s;ter in the Street,</HI> an old, dirty, thoroughfare Town, void of all Remains of the Greatne&s;s, which Antiquaries &s;ay were to be &s;een there, when it was a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony. Here is a Stone Bridge, but in|&s;tead of riding over it, we rode under it, thro' one of the Arches, the Stream not being over the Hor&s;es Hoofs in Water; yet, on Inquiry, we found, that &s;ometimes they have U&s;e enough for it.</P>

This, with a &s;ometimes navigable River ju&s;t at hand, by which the Coals are carried down to <HI>Sunderland</HI> to the Ships, makes <HI>Lumley</HI> Park an inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure to the Family.</P>
<P>They tell us, that King <HI>James</HI> I. lodged in this Ca&s;tle, at his Entrance into <HI>England</HI> to take Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Throne; and &s;eeing a fine Picture of the antient Pedigree of the Family, which carried it very far beyond what his Maje&s;ty thought credible, turned this good Je&s;t upon it to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dur|ham,</HI> who &s;hewed it him, <HI>That indeed he did not know, that</HI> Adam<HI>'s Surname was</HI> Lumley, <HI>before.</HI></P>

It is a Penin&s;ula, almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the Sea. It has a very fine Church; and its Rector, the Rev. and worthy Mr. <HI>Daniel Newcome,</HI> was the principal Architect in the building of it. This Gentleman &s;pent the greate&s;t Part of his Income in beautifying and adorning it. He began by building a Dome, adjoining to the Ea&s;t-end, into which he removed the Altar, placing it under a Canopy of inlaid Work, &s;upported in Front by Two fluted Pillars of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, with proper Capitals. His Bene|volence and Charity were equally exten&s;ive to all who were proper Objects of them; and he delighted in doing Good.

<P>The Ea&s;tern Side of the County, along the Sea Coa&s;t, and indeed the Southern Side, along the Banks of the <HI>Teis,</HI> is very fertile and delightful, thick of little Towns and Villages, which are very populous; and as the Mountains on the We&s;t pro|duce Iron Mines, this Side is full of tho&s;e of Coals, which lie &s;o very near the Surface of the Ground, that the Cart Wheels pre&s;s into them.</P>
<P>And indeed from <HI>Durham,</HI> the Road to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> gives a View of the inexhau&s;ted Store of Coals and Coal Pits, from whence not <HI>London</HI> only, but all the South Part of <HI>England</HI> is continually &s;upplied; and tho' at <HI>London,</HI> when we &s;ee the prodigious Fleets of Ships which come con&s;tantly in with Coals, we are apt to wonder how it is po&s;&s;ible for them to be &s;upplied, and that they do not bring the whole Coal Country away; yet, when in this Country we &s;ee the prodigious Heaps, I might &s;ay Mountains of Coals, which are dug up at every Pit, and how many of tho&s;e Pits there are, we are filled with equal Wonder to con&s;ider where the People &s;hould live that con&s;ume them.</P>

<P>The Air in this Bi&s;hoprick is pretty cold and piercing; and 'tis well for the Poor, that Nature has &s;upplied them &s;o abundantly with Fuel for Firing; and indeed all other Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries are very cheap here.

<P>The Liberty of the Town, as it is a Corporation, extends no farther than the Gate upon the Bridge; which, &s;ome Years &s;ince, was the Pre&s;ervation of it, by &s;topping a terrible Fire, that otherwi&s;e had, per|haps, burnt the whole Street of Hou&s;es on the City Side of the Bridge, as it did tho&s;e beyond it. On the Ea&s;t Side of this Gate the Arms of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> are carved, as tho&s;e of the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> are on the We&s;t Side.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a very noble <HI>Exchange</HI> here; and the Wall of the Town runs parallel from it with the River, leaving a &s;pacious Piece of Ground before it between the Water and the Wall; which being well wharfed up, and faced with Free-&s;tone, makes the longe&s;t and large&s;t Quay for landing and lading Goods, that is to be &s;een in <HI>England,</HI> except that at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> it being much longer than that at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a large Ho&s;pital built by Contribution of the Keel Men, by way of Friendly Society, for the Maintenance of the Poor of their Fraternity, and which, had it not met with Di&s;couragements from tho&s;e who ought rather to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;o good a Work, might have been a noble Provi&s;ion for that numerous and laborious People. The Keel Men are tho&s;e who manage the Lighters, which they call <HI>Keels,</HI> by which the Coals are taken from the Staiths, or Wharfs, and carried on board the Ships at <HI>Sheals</HI> to load them for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Here are &s;everal large publick Buildings al&s;o; par|ticularly a Hou&s;e of State for the Mayor of the Town (for the Time being) to remove to, and dwell in during his Mayoralty. Here is al&s;o a Hall

<P>And &s;ince this Work went to the Pre&s;s, I am inform'd, that the Rev. Dr. <HI>Robert Thomlin&s;on,</HI> Rector of <HI>Whickham</HI> in the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> and Prebendary of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, gave to this Corporation a valuable Collection of Books, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 6000 Volumes; and al&s;o &s;ettled a Rent-charge of Five Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for ever, for buying new Books. And <HI>Walter Blackett,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, has, at his own Ex|pence, built a hand&s;ome Fabrick for the Reception of tho&s;e Books, and &s;ettled in Mortmain a Rent-charge of 25<HI>l. per Annum</HI> for ever for a Librarian.</P>
<P>The Town is defended by an exceeding &s;trong Wall, wherein are Seven Gates, and as many Tur|rets, The Ca&s;tle, tho' old and ruinous, overlooks the whole Town. The wor&s;t is, that the Situation of the Town b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing on the Declivity of Two high Hills, and the Buildings being very clo&s;e and old, render it incommodious, to which the Smoke of the Coals contributes not a little; and con&s;equently excludes &s;uch who &s;eek a Re&s;idence of Plea&s;ure: but then as the River which runs between the Two Hills, makes it a Place of great Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, that Inconvenience is abundantly recompen&s;ed.</P>
<P>They have Two Articles of Trade here, which are particularly owing to the Coals, <HI>viz.</HI> Gla&s;s|hou&s;es and Salt-pans; the fir&s;t are in the Town, the la&s;t are at <HI>Sheals,</HI> Seven Miles below it; but their Coals are brought chiefly from the Town. Prodi|gious are the Quantities of Coals which tho&s;e Salt Works con&s;ume; and the Fires make &s;uch a Smoke, that we &s;aw it a&s;cend in huge Clouds over the Hills, Four Miles before we came to <HI>Durham,</HI> which is at lea&s;t 16 Miles from the Place. In &s;hort, the

<P>Here I met with a Remark which was quite new to me, and will be &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, to many others. You well know, we receive at <HI>London</HI> every Year a great Quantity of Salmon pickled or cured, and &s;ent up in the Pickle in Kits or Tubs, which we call <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Salmon. In con&s;equence of this, when I came to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> I expected to &s;ee great Plenty of Salmon there; but was &s;urpri&s;ed to find it, on the contrary, &s;o &s;carce, that a good large fre&s;h Salmon was not to be had under Five or Six Shillings. Upon Inquiry I learnt, that really this Salmon, which we call <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Salmon, is taken as far off as the <HI>Tweed,</HI> which is near 50 Miles further, and is brought by Land on Hor&s;es to <HI>Sheals,</HI> where it is cured, pickled, and &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> as above; &s;o that it is more properly <HI>Berwick</HI> Salmon than <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Parochial Church, called <HI>St. Ni|colas,</HI> built by St. <HI>David,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but &s;everal Chapels as large as Churches. Here are like|wi&s;e &s;ome Meeting-hou&s;es, and a great many well-endowed Charity-&s;chools. It is not only inriched by the Coal Trade, but there are al&s;o very con&s;iderable Merchants in it, who carry on Traffick to divers Parts of the World, e&s;pecially to <HI>Holland, Ham|burgh, Norway,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>They build Ships here to Perfection as to Strength and Firmne&s;s, and to bear the Sea, as the Coal Trade requires. This gives an Addition to the Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s, it requiring a Supply of all Sorts of Naval Stores to fit out tho&s;e Ships.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a con&s;iderable Manufacture of Hard Ware, or Wrought Iron, of late Years erected after the manner of <HI>Sheffield,</HI> which is very helpful for

imploying the Poor, of which the Town has always a prodigious Number.</P>
<P>This Town was taken and plundered by the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Beginning of the late Civil Wars; and here it was, (to their eternal Reproach be it remem|ber'd) that the <HI>Scots</HI> perfidiou&s;ly &s;old their King for 2000<HI>l.</HI> in hand, and Security for 2000<HI>l.</HI> more, after he had in Confidence intru&s;ted him&s;elf in their Hands, and without any Conditions made for him: a Tran&s;action equally dete&s;table with that of cutting off his Head; or more, if po&s;&s;ible, as tho&s;e who did the la&s;t were his avow'd and implacable Enemies, whereas the others received him as his Friends and Protectors.</P>
<P>On the 12th of <HI>January,</HI> 1738-9, Part of the antient Gate, leading to the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Garth,</HI> fell down; and tho' &s;everal Shops joined to it, yet nobody receiv'd any Hurt.</P>
<P>The Town was formerly fortify'd with a great Ca&s;tle, the Walls of which are &s;till &s;tanding. Its antient Name was <HI>Monk-Che&s;ter</HI>; but on the build|ing of a new Ca&s;tle in the Time of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> it obtain'd its pre&s;ent Name.

<P>We&s;t from <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> lies the Bailiwick-Town of <HI>Hexham,</HI> (the <HI>Axelodunum</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI>) a Pa&s;s upon the <HI>Tyne,</HI> famous, or rather infamous, for having the fir&s;t Blood drawn near it in the late Civil War; and where a Detachment of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> tho' advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, were &s;candalou&s;ly defeated by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who gain'd the Pa&s;s, fought thro' the River, and killed about 400 Men, the re&s;t ba&s;ely running away; after which, the Town of <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> was as ea&s;ily &s;eized upon, without &s;triking a Stroke.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">The Country round this Town is vulgarly called <HI>Hexham&s;hire.</HI> It was formerly the Seat of a Bi&s;hop, till <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. annexed it to that of <HI>Durham.</HI> Its Cathedral was &s;tately, before the <HI>Scots</HI> ruin'd the greate&s;t Part of it in one of their Excur&s;ions.

<P>I was greatly tempted here to trace the famous Wall built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> or rather rebuilt by them, from hence to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> the Particulats of which, and the Remains of Antiquity &s;een upon it, our Hi&s;tories are full of. I went to &s;everal Places in the Fields thro' which it pa&s;&s;ed, where I &s;aw the Re|mains of it, &s;ome almo&s;t lo&s;t, and &s;ome very vi&s;i|ble. But of this more in another Place.</P>
<P><HI>Northumberland</HI> is a long coa&s;ting County, lying chiefly on the Sea to the Ea&s;t, and bounded by the Mountains of <HI>Stainmore</HI> on the We&s;t, which are in &s;ome Places inacce&s;&s;ible, but in many others unpa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>Here is abundant Bu&s;ine&s;s for an Antiquary; every Place &s;hews you ruined Ca&s;tles, <HI>Roman</HI> Altars, In|&s;criptions, Monuments of Battles, of Heroes killed, Armies routed, and the like. The Towns of <HI>Mor|peth, Alnwick, Warkworth, Tickill,</HI> and many others, &s;hew their old Ca&s;tles, and &s;ome of them &s;till in tolerable Repair, <HI>Alnwick</HI> in particular, and <HI>Warkworth</HI>; others, as <HI>Bambrough, Norham, Chil|lingham, Horton, Dun&s;tar, Wark,</HI> and a great many more, are &s;unk in their own Ruins, by mere Length of Time.</P>
<P>We had <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hills &s;o plain in view, that we could not but inquire of the Inhabitants every-where, whether they had heard of the Fight at <HI>Chevy-Chace:</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="207">
they not only told us they had heard of it, but had all the Account of it at their Fingers End; where|upon taking a Guide at <HI>Wooller,</HI> a &s;mall Town, lying, as it were, under the Hills, he led us on to|ward the Top of the Hill; for, by the way, altho' there are many Hills and Reachings for many Miles, which bear the Name of <HI>Cheviot Hills,</HI> yet there is one of them a great deal higher than the re&s;t, which, at a Di&s;tance, looks like the <HI>Pico-Teneriffe</HI> in the <HI>Ca|naries,</HI> and is &s;o high, that it is plainly &s;een from the <HI>Ro&s;emary Top</HI> in the Ea&s;t-Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> which is near 60 Miles off.</P>
<P>We were preparing to clamber up this Hill on Foot, when our Guide told us, he would find a Way for us to get up on Hor&s;e-back. He then very artfully led us round to a Part of the Hill, where, in the Winter-&s;ea&s;on, great Streams of Water come pouring down from it in &s;everal Cha|nels, which were pretty broad, and over-grown on each Side with Alder-trees &s;o clo&s;e and thick, that we rode under them as in an Arbour. In one of the&s;e Chanels we mounted the Hill, as Be&s;iegers approach a fortified Town by Trenches, and were got a great way up, before we were well aware of it; for we were already &s;o far advanced, that we could &s;ee &s;ome of the Hills, which before we thought very high, lying under us, as if they were a Part of the Plain below. As we mounted higher, we found the Hill &s;teeper than at fir&s;t; and our Hor&s;es being very much fatigu'd, we alighted, and proceeded on Foot. When we had gain'd the Top, we were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a &s;mooth and plea&s;ant Plain half a Mile in Diameter, with a large Pond in the middle of it; for we had a Notion, when at Bottom, that the Hill narrow'd to a Point, and that when we came to the Top, we &s;hould be as upon a Pinacle, with a Precipice every Way round us.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">The Day, to our great Satisfaction, happen'd to be very calm, and &s;o clear, that we could plainly &s;ee the Smoke of the Salt-pans at <HI>Sheals,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> which was about 40 Miles South from this. We &s;aw likewi&s;e &s;everal Hills, which our Guide told us were in <HI>England,</HI> and others in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Names of which I have forgot. Ea&s;tward we &s;aw <HI>Berwick,</HI> and to the North the Hills called <HI>Soutra</HI> Hills, which are in Sight of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> In &s;hort, we had a &s;urprizing View of the united Kingdom; and tho' all the Country round us looked very well, yet, it mu&s;t be owned, the <HI>Scots</HI> Side &s;eemed the plea&s;ante&s;t, and had the be&s;t Ground.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this Pro&s;pect, and not thinking our Time or Pains ill be&s;towed, we came down the Hill by the &s;ame Rout we went up. Our Guide after|wards carried us to a &s;ingle Hou&s;e, called <HI>Wooller Haugh-head,</HI> a much better Inn than we expected to meet with thereabouts.</P>
<P>At this Inn, we inquired after the Particulars of the famous Story of <HI>Chevy Cha&s;e,</HI> and found that the People had the following Notion of it; That it was an Inroad of the Earl of <HI>Douglas</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> in order to ravage, burn, and plunder the Country, as was u&s;ual in tho&s;e Days: That <HI>Piercy,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> march'd with his Friends and Fol|lowers, to meet the <HI>Scots</HI>; both Parties encounter'd at the Foot of <HI>Cheviot Hills,</HI> and a bloody Battle en&s;ued, wherein both the Earls were &s;lain, de&s;pe|rately fighting at the Head of their Troops; and &s;o many fell on both Sides, that it could not be deter|min'd which had the Victory.</P>
<P>They &s;hewed us the Place where this Battle was fought, which, if their Tradition does not mi&s;lead them, is on the Side of the Hill near the Road. It is &s;aid, the <HI>Scots</HI> were mo&s;tly Hor&s;e, and therefore the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Archers placed them&s;elves on the Side of
<PB N="208" REF="209">
a &s;teep A&s;cent, that they might not be broken in upon by them. The Spots of Ground where the Two Earls are &s;aid to have fallen, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by Two Stones to this Day. The Fight the <HI>Scots</HI> call the Battle of <HI>Otterburn,</HI> and make a very fa|mous Story of it, to the Honour of their Nation.</P>
<P>About Six or Seven Miles from hence we &s;aw the ever memorable <HI>Flodden-field,</HI> where <HI>James</HI> IV. King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> invading <HI>England</HI> with a great Army, when <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was engaged abroad in the Siege of <HI>Tournay,</HI> was met by the gallant Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> in which, after a bloody Battle, the <HI>Scots</HI> were totally defeated, and their King, fighting vali|antly at the Head of his Nobility, was &s;lain.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Till,</HI> which our Hi&s;torians call a deep and &s;wift River, where many of the <HI>Scots</HI> were drown'd in their Flight, &s;eemed to me every-where pa&s;&s;able with great Ea&s;e; but perhaps it might at that time be &s;welled with &s;ome &s;udden Rain, which the Hi&s;torians ought to have taken notice of.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not quit <HI>Northumberland</HI> without taking notice, that the Natives of this Country, of the ancient original Race or Families, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a <HI>Shibboleth</HI> upon their Tongues in pronouncing the Letter <HI>R,</HI> which they cannot utter without a hollow Jarring in the Throat, by which they are as plainly known, as a Foreigner is in pronouncing the <HI>Th:</HI> this they call the <HI>Northumberland R,</HI> or <HI>Wharle</HI>; and the Natives value them&s;elves upon that Imper|fection, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, it &s;hews the Antiquity of their Blood.</P>
<P>From hence lay a Road into <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Town of <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> which I afterwards pa&s;&s;ed thro'; but at pre&s;ent inclining to &s;ee <HI>Berwick upon Tweed,</HI> we turned to the We&s;t, and vi&s;ited that old Fron|tier, where is a fine Bridge over the <HI>Tweed,</HI> built by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; a noble, &s;tately Work, con|&s;i&s;ting of 16 Arches, and joining, as may be &s;aid,
<PB N="209" REF="210">
the Two Kingdoms. The chief Trade I found here was in Corn and Salmon.</P>
<P>I am now on the Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and mu&s;t call to mind, that I have not yet gone over the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> viz. <HI>Lanca&s;ter, We&s;t|morland,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs own, that &s;ince I entered upon the View of the&s;e Northern Counties, I have many times regretted, that my Limits forbid me often to decline the delightful View of Antiquity, of which there is &s;o great and &s;o &s;urprizing a Variety every Day di&s;covered; for the religious, as well as military Re|mains of the <HI>Britons, Romans, Saxons,</HI> and <HI>Nor|mans,</HI> like Wounds ha&s;tily healed up, appear pre|&s;ently when the <HI>Callus,</HI> which was &s;pread over them, is removed; and though the Earth has defaced the Figures and In&s;criptions upon mo&s;t of the&s;e Curio|&s;ities, yet they are beautiful, even in their Decay; and the venerable Face of Antiquity has &s;omething &s;o plea&s;ing, &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;o &s;atisfactory in it, e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e who have, with any Attention, read the Hi&s;tories of pa&s;t Ages, that I know nothing which renders Travelling more plea&s;ant and more agreeable.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. CONTAINING A De&s;cription of the Counties of <HI>Lanca&s;ter, We&s;tmorland,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Entered <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> at the remote&s;t We&s;tern Point of that County, hav|ing been at <HI>We&s;t Che&s;ter</HI> upon a parti|cular Occa&s;ion, and from thence fer|ry'd over from the <HI>Ce&s;trian Cher&s;o|ne&s;us,</HI> as I have already called it, to <HI>Liverpoole.</HI> This narrow Slip of Land, rich, fertile, and full of Inhabitants, tho' formerly, as Authors &s;ay, a mere wa&s;te and de&s;olate Fore&s;t, is called <HI>Wirall,</HI> or by &s;ome <HI>Wirehall.</HI> Here is a Ferry over the <HI>Mer&s;ee,</HI> which, at full Sea, is more than two Miles over. You land on the flat Shore on the other Side, and mu&s;t be content to ride thro' the Water for &s;ome Length, not on Hor&s;eback, but on the Shoulders of &s;ome <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Clown, who comes Knee-deep to the Boat's Side, to tru&s;s one up; and then runs away more nimbly than one de&s;ires to ride, unle&s;s his Trot were ea&s;ier.</P>
<P><HI>Liverpoole</HI> is one of the Wonders of <HI>Britain,</HI> be|cau&s;e of its prodigious Increa&s;e of Trade and Build|ings,
<PB N="211" REF="212">
within the Compa&s;s of a very few Years; rivalling <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> in the Trade to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI> They trade al&s;o round the whole I&s;land, &s;end Ships to <HI>Norway,</HI> to <HI>Ham|burg,</HI> and to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> as al&s;o to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI>; &s;o that, they are almo&s;t become, like the <HI>Londoners,</HI> univer&s;al Merchants.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Liverpoole</HI> con&s;i&s;ts not only in Mer|chandizing and Corre&s;pondencies beyond Seas; but as they import almo&s;t all Kinds of foreign Goods, they have con&s;equently a large Inland Trade, and a great Corre&s;pondence with <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> for Con&s;umption of their Goods, exactly as it is with <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; and they really divide the Trade with <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> upon very remarkable Equalities.</P>
<P><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> lies upon the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea; &s;o does <HI>Liver|poole: Bri&s;tol</HI> trades chiefly to the South and We&s;t Parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> from <HI>Dublin</HI> in the Ea&s;t to <HI>Gallo|way</HI> We&s;t; <HI>Liverpoole</HI> has all the Trade of the Ea&s;t Shore and the North, from the Harbour of <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Londonderry: Bri&s;tol</HI> has the Trade of <HI>South Wales</HI>; <HI>Liverpoole</HI> great Part of the Trade of <HI>North Wales: Bri&s;tol</HI> has the South-we&s;t Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome North of it, as high as <HI>Bridge-North,</HI> and perhaps to <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI>; <HI>Liverpoole</HI> has all the Northern Counties; and a large Con&s;umption of Goods in <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> is &s;upplied from thence.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland</HI> is al&s;o &s;hared between both; and for the Northern Coa&s;t of it, if the <HI>Liverpoole</HI> Men have not the whole Fi&s;hery, or, at lea&s;t, in Company with the Merchants of <HI>Londonderry,</HI> the Fault is their own. The Situation of <HI>Liverpoole</HI> is very advantageous to|wards improving its Commerce, and extending it into the Northern Inland Counties of <HI>England,</HI> par|ticularly into <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> by the new Navigation of the Rivers <HI>Mer&s;ee,</HI> the <HI>Weaver,</HI> and the <HI>Dane.</HI> By the la&s;t the Merchants come &s;o near
<PB N="212" REF="213">
the <HI>Trent</HI> with their Goods, that they make no Difficulty to carry them by Land to <HI>Burton,</HI> and from thence corre&s;pond quite thro' the Kingdom, even to <HI>Hull</HI>; and they begin to be very &s;en&s;ible of the Profit of &s;uch a Commerce.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome Advantage to the growing Commerce of this Town, that the Freemen of it are, in con&s;e|quence of that Freedom, free al&s;o of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; as they are of the Corporations of <HI>Waterford</HI> and <HI>Wex|ford</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Not that the&s;e Corporation Privileges are of any great Value to <HI>Liverpoole</HI> in its foreign Trade; but in particular Ca&s;es, it may be &s;ome Advantage, as in Town Duties, in admitting them to &s;et up Trades in tho&s;e Corporations, and the like.</P>
<P>The Town has no Fortifications either to the Land or the Sea; tho' when the late Northern In&s;urrection reached to <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> the Inhabitants would have been glad of Walls and Gates; and indeed, had the Rebel Party had time to have advanced to <HI>Warrington,</HI> &s;eized the Pa&s;s there, and taken <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> as they would certainly have done in three Days more, it would have fared but very ill with <HI>Liverpoole,</HI> which could have made but little Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an armed and de&s;perate Body of Men: be&s;ides, the Rebels would have not only found the Sweets of Plunder here, but Arms, Ammunition, Powder, and Lead, all which they extremely wanted. They would have had Ships al&s;o to have facilitated a Communi|cation with <HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence Numbers would have landed, if it had been only in hopes of Plunder. But, happy for <HI>Liverpoole,</HI> as well as the whole Kingdom! the Rebels were defeated, before they proceeded &s;o far.</P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>Liverpoole</HI> being on the North Bank of the River, with the Di&s;advantage of a flat Shore, the Merchants were laid under great Diffi|culties in their Bu&s;ine&s;s; for tho' the Harbour was
<PB N="213" REF="214">
good, and the Ships rode well in the <HI>Offing,</HI> yet they were obliged to ride there as in a Road, rather than a Harbour. Here was no Mole or Haven to bring in their Ships, and lay them up (as the Seamen call it) for the Winter, nor any Quay for the delivering their Goods, as at <HI>Bri&s;tol, Biddiford, Newca&s;tle, Hull,</HI> and other Sea Ports. Upon this, the Inhabitants and Merchants, by the Aid of an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the Eighth Year of the Reign of the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which was prolonged by another, pa&s;&s;ed in the Third Year of his Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I. made a large Ba&s;in, or wet Dock, at the Ea&s;t End of the Town, where, at a very great Charge, the Place con&s;idered, they have brought the Tide from the <HI>Mer&s;ee,</HI> to flow up by an Opening, that looks to the South, and the Ships go in North; &s;o that the Town &s;helters it from the We&s;terly and Northerly Winds, the Hills from the Ea&s;terly, and the Ships lie, as in a Mill-pond, with the utmo&s;t Safety and Con|venience. As this is &s;o great a Benefit to the Town, the like of which is not to be &s;een in any Place of <HI>England,</HI> for the Merchants Service, <HI>London</HI> excepted, it is well worth the Imitation of many other trade|ing Places in <HI>Britain,</HI> who for want of &s;uch a Con|venience, lo&s;e their Trade; for indeed the Inhabit|ants of <HI>Liverpoole</HI> &s;uffered not a little for want of it in the great Storm, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703. This Dock is capable of holding 100 Sail of Ships.</P>
<P>But tho' the&s;e new Works have been of &s;uch Ad|vantage to this flouri&s;hing Town, yet &s;omething more appeared wanting to crown the Work; for, it &s;eems, the Entrance into the Dock or Ba&s;in, from the open Harbour, was &s;o &s;treight, that Ships and Ve&s;&s;els lying in the Dock were often hinder'd from getting out to Sea; and tho&s;e without the Dock, in the open Harbour, were frequently forced a&s;hore and lo&s;t. To remedy this Inconvenience, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1738, for inlarging the &s;aid Entrance, and for erect|ing
<PB N="214" REF="215">
a Pier in the open Harbour, on the North and South Sides of the &s;aid Entrance. And as the Lives of divers Per&s;ons were endanger'd and lo&s;t, and Goods often run and &s;muggled, for want of keeping proper and &s;ufficient Lights in the Night-time, about the &s;aid Wet-dock or Ba&s;in, the &s;ame Act impowers the Corporation to &s;et up &s;uch a Number of Lamps to enlighten the Dock, as they &s;hall think requi|&s;ite: all which mu&s;t be of the highe&s;t Benefit to this fine Town, and a great Furtherance to its Trade and Navigation.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e adjoining to the Dock is al&s;o but the Work of a few Years pa&s;t, and is not only a commodious, but an elegant Piece of Building.</P>
<P><HI>Liverpoole</HI> had formerly but one Church, dedi|cated to our Lady, and St. <HI>Nicolas,</HI> and that depen|dent on the Pari&s;h of <HI>Walton</HI>; but upon the Increa&s;e of Inhabitants, and of new Buildings, in &s;o extraordi|nary a manner, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the Tenth Year of King <HI>William</HI> III. enabling the Cor|poration to build and endow a new one, and to make <HI>Liverpoole</HI> independent of <HI>Walton. Anno</HI> 1704, the Church of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, which had been built at the Charge of the Pari&s;h to which it was appropriated, was con&s;ecrated. But this being &s;till not &s;ufficient for this flouri&s;hing Town, her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in the Third Year of her Reign, granted to the Corporation for 50 Years a Lea&s;e of the Scite of <HI>Liverpoole</HI> Ca&s;tle, which had long lain in Ruins, whereon to erect a third Church, and other Edifices, under the yearly Rent of 6<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> together with Liberty to u&s;e the Mate|rials of the old Ca&s;tle for that Purpo&s;e. And his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I. by Act of Parliament, was plea&s;ed to make over to the Corporation for ever, on a Re&s;erve of the &s;ame annual Rent, the &s;aid Scite of the old Ca&s;tle; whereon the Inhabitants erected the &s;aid third Church, and in Honour to that Prince,
<PB N="215" REF="216">
dedicated it to St. <HI>George.</HI> It was fini&s;h'd in the Year 1734, from the Revenues ari&s;ing from the Cor|poration-Lands, and the Duty on Merchandize, which are e&s;timated at 200<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> The&s;e Churches are very hand&s;ome and capacious Buildings. That on the North of the Town has in it a fine Font of Marble, placed in the Body of the Church, &s;ur|rounded with a beautiful Iron Pali&s;ado; the Gift of the late Mr. <HI>Hey&s;ham,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> but con&s;iderably concerned in Trade on this Side, and for many Years Member of Parliament for <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> There is a beautiful Tower to this Church, and a new Ring of eight Bells.</P>
<P>The Town-hou&s;e is a fine modern Building, &s;tand|ing all upon Pillars of Free&s;tone; the Place under it is their <HI>Tol&s;ey,</HI> or Exchange, for the Meeting of their Merchants; but they begin to want more Room, and talk of inlarging it, or removing the Exchange to the other part of the Town, where the Ships and Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s is nearer at hand.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a good Free-&s;chool, well endow'd, and likewi&s;e a very noble Charity-&s;chool, which was built, and is &s;upported, by the generous Contributions of the Inhabitants, for 50 Boys and 12 Girls, who are maintained with Cloaths, Meat, and Lodging, and have proper Education be&s;tow'd upon them.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o &s;everal Alms-hou&s;es for the Support of Sailors Widows, and other old and indigent Peo|ple: and &s;ince the Year 1730, a Work-hou&s;e for the Poor has al&s;o been erected, which, by good Ma|nagement, has reduc'd the Poor's Rate from two Shillings in the Pound to Ten-pence; and they made no Doubt, when I was there la&s;t, that in a Year or two it would be brought under Six-pence in the Pound.</P>
<P>It is a Corporate Town, govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen. The Harbour is defended on the South-&s;ide by a Ca&s;tle, and the We&s;t by a Tower on the River <HI>Mer&s;ee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217">In a Word, there is no Town in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>London,</HI> that can equal <HI>Liverpoole</HI> for the Finene&s;s of the Streets, and Beauty of the Buildings. Many of the Hou&s;es are built of Free-&s;tone, and com|pletely fini&s;hed; and all the re&s;t (of the new Part I mean) of Brick, as hand&s;omely built as <HI>London</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Formerly <HI>Liverpoole</HI> was but indifferently &s;upply'd with fre&s;h Water; but they have been for many Years well accommodated in that re&s;pect, by vir|tue of an Act of Parliament pa&s;s'd for that Purpo&s;e, in the Eighth Year of the Reign of her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that &s;ome of the Streets are named from their Relation to the Family of the <HI>Mores</HI> of <HI>Blank-hall,</HI> formerly chief Lords and Owners of the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Liverpoole,</HI> and who fir&s;t began to beautify and adorn it with fine Stone Buildings.</P>
<P>From hence the <HI>Mer&s;ee</HI> opening into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, we could &s;ee the great and famous Road of <HI>Hile Lake,</HI> remarkable for the &s;hipping off, or rather Rendezvous of the Army and Fleet under King <HI>Wil|liam,</HI> for the Conque&s;t of <HI>Ireland, Anno</HI> 1689; for here the Men of War rode as our Ships do in the <HI>Downs,</HI> till the Tran&s;ports came to them from <HI>Che|&s;ter</HI> and this Town.</P>
<P>Going Ea&s;t, we pa&s;s'd through <HI>Pre&s;cot,</HI> a large Market-town, but thinly inhabited; and came to <HI>Warrington.</HI></P>
<P>This is a large old-built Market-town upon the River <HI>Mer&s;ee,</HI> over which is erected a &s;tately Stone Bridge, which is the only Bridge of Communication for the whole County with that of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> It is on the great Road from <HI>London</HI> leading to <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and, in ca&s;e of War, has always been e&s;teemed a Pa&s;s of the utmo&s;t Importance. It was found to be &s;o upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions in the Time of the late Civil War; and had the Rebel <HI>Scots</HI> ad|vanced thus far in the late <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Affair, &s;o as to
<PB N="217" REF="218">
have made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, it would have been &s;o again; and, on that Account, the King's Forces took &s;pecial Care, by a &s;peedy Advance, to &s;ecure it.</P>
<P><HI>Warrington</HI> is populous and rich, and full of good Country Trade&s;men. Here is particularly a weekly Market for Linen, as I &s;aw at <HI>Wrexham</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> a Market for Flanel. The Linen &s;old at this Market, is, generally &s;peaking, a Sort of Table Linen, called <HI>Huk-a-buk.</HI> It is likewi&s;e noted for excellent Malt. I was told there are generally as many Pieces of this Linen &s;old here every Market-day, as amount to 500<HI>l.</HI> &s;ometimes much more, and all made in the Neighbourhood of the Place.</P>
<P>Not far off is the Village of <HI>Winick,</HI> fam'd for its Rectory, worth about 800<HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>From hence, on the Road to <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed the great Bog or Wa&s;te, called <HI>Chat-mo&s;s,</HI> the fir&s;t of that Kind that we &s;aw in <HI>England,</HI> from any of the South Parts hither. It extends on the Left|&s;ide of the Road for five or &s;ix Miles Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and they told us it was, in &s;ome Places, &s;even or eight Miles from North to South. There are many of the&s;e Mo&s;&s;es in this County: take this for a De&s;cription of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Surface, at a Di&s;tance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of; for it will bear neither Hor&s;e nor Man, unle&s;s in an exceeding dry Sea&s;on, and then &s;o as not to be travelled over with Safety.</P>
<P>The Surface &s;eems to be a Collection of the &s;mall Roots of innumerable Vegetables matted together, interwoven &s;o thick, as well the larger Roots as the &s;maller Fibres, that it makes a Sub&s;tance hard enough to cut out into Turf or Peat, which, in &s;ome Places, the People pile up in the Sun, and dry for their Fuel. The Roots I &s;peak of are in general &s;mall and &s;oft, not unlike the Roots of <HI>A&s;paragus,</HI> or of
<PB N="218" REF="219">
<HI>Bearbind,</HI> and have no Earth among them, except what they contract from the Air, and Du&s;t flying in it; but the Rain keeps them, as it were, always growing, tho' not much increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Places the Surface of this is very thick, in others le&s;s. We &s;aw it &s;ometimes eight or nine Feet thick, and the Water that drained from it look|ed clear, but of a deep brown, like &s;tale Beer. What Nature meant by &s;uch an u&s;ele&s;s Production, is hard to imagine; but the Land is intirely wa&s;te, except, as above, for the poor Cottagers Fuel, and the Quantity u&s;ed for that is very &s;mall.</P>
<P>Under the Mo&s;s, or rather in the very Body of it, and not here only, but in &s;everal like Places, per|haps in all of them, tho&s;e antient Fir-trees are found, which are &s;o unaccountable, that much Learn|ing has been &s;hewn to very little Purpo&s;e on this Subject; for after all, whatever has been &s;aid, mu&s;t be mere Conjecture and Uncertainty: but in my weak Judgment, it may be thus accounted for; That Nature, who&s;e Works are all directed by a &s;uperior Hand, has been guided to produce Trees here un|der Ground, as &s;he does in other Places above Ground: that as the Trees above the Surface grow erect and high, the&s;e lie prone and horizontal: tho&s;e &s;hoot forth Branches and Leaves; the&s;e &s;hoot forth none, yet have a Vegetation by Methods directed by Nature, and particular to that Kind; and 'tis re|markable, that if they lie buried, they will grow and increa&s;e; but if you take them up, and plant them in the Air, they will wither and die.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the&s;e Trees are a Kind of Fir, and are very full of Turpentine. Whether there is any Tar in them, I am not po&s;itive, but I &s;uppo&s;e there is; and yet I do not &s;ee, that for this Rea&s;on they &s;hould not be a natural ordinary Pro|duct, as other Vegetables are.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">As to their being brought hither by the general Convul&s;ion of the Globe at the Deluge, the Thought is &s;o repugnant to common Sen&s;e, that I think it neither needs nor de&s;erves any other Notice.</P>
<P>From hence we came on to <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> one of the greate&s;t, if not really, <HI>the</HI> greate&s;t mere Village in <HI>England.</HI> It is neither a Town, City, nor Cor|poration, nor &s;ends Members to Parliament. The highe&s;t Magi&s;trate is a Con&s;table, or Headborough; and yet it has a Collegiate Church, takes up a large Space of Ground, and, including the Suburbs, or that Part of the Town on the other Side of the Bridge, it is &s;aid to contain above 50,000 People.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of Buildings at <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> within the&s;e few Years, is a Confirmation of the Increa&s;e of People; for here, as at <HI>Liverpoole,</HI> and as at <HI>Froom</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> the Town is extended in a &s;urpri&s;ing Manner; abundance of new-built Streets are added, as al&s;o a new Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Anne</HI>; and they talk of founding another, and a fine new Square; by which means the Town is almo&s;t double to what it was &s;ome Years ago.</P>
<P>So that you have here an open Village, which is greater and more populous than many, nay, than mo&s;t Cities in <HI>England.</HI> Neither <HI>York, Lincoln, Che|&s;ter, Sali&s;bury, Winche&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> nor <HI>Norwich</HI> it&s;elf, can come up to it; and for le&s;&s;er Cities, two or three put together, would not equal it, &s;uch as <HI>Peterborough, Ely,</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> or &s;uch as <HI>Bath, Wells,</HI> and <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> boa&s;ts of Four extraor|dinary Foundations, a College, an Ho&s;pital, a Free|&s;chool, and a Library, all very well &s;upported.</P>
<P>The College was the Charity of <HI>Thomas We&s;t,</HI> Lord <HI>Delaware,</HI> who being but the Cadet of the Family, was bred a Scholar, took Orders, and be|came Rector of the Pari&s;h, which he enjoyed many Years: but, by the Decea&s;e of his elder Brother with|out
<PB N="220" REF="221">
Heirs, &s;ucceeding to his Honour and E&s;tate, he founded the College in the Year 1421. The Pope, in Con&s;ideration that the Family was likely to be extinct, is &s;aid to have allowed him to marry, on his performing &s;o beneficial a Penance. It was dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the two Patron Saints of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> St. <HI>Denys</HI> and St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>This Foundation e&s;caping the general Ruin, under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was di&s;&s;olved 1547. in the fir&s;t Year of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. After this, it was refounded by Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; and then anew by Queen <HI>Elizabeth, Anno</HI> 1578, by the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t's Church</HI> in <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>; and la&s;t of all it was refounded by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>Anno</HI> 1636, con&s;i&s;ting then of one Warden, four Fellows, two Chaplains, four Singing Men, and four Chori&s;ters, incorporating them, as they were by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by the Name of the Wardens and Fellows of <HI>Chri&s;t's Church</HI> in <HI>Man|che&s;ter,</HI> the Statutes for the &s;ame being drawn up by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud.</HI></P>
<P>The Vi&s;itor of this Collegiate Church is the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I. have|ing made Dr. <HI>Peploe</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> who at the &s;ame time was Warden of the Church, the Vi&s;itato|rial Power and the Warden&s;hip being incompatible, an Act pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Anno</HI> 1729, impowering his Maje&s;ty to be the Vi&s;itor, when&s;oever the Warden of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> happened to be Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> was founded by <HI>Humphrey Chetham,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and incorporated by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. de&s;igned by the &s;aid bountiful Benefactor for the Maintenance of 40 poor Boys out of the Town and Pari&s;h of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and &s;ome other neighbouring Pari&s;hes; but it is inlarged &s;ince to the Number of 60, by the Governors of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, who have improved the Revenues of it.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Founder al&s;o erected a very fair and &s;pacious Library, which is furni&s;hed with a competent Stock
<PB N="221" REF="222">
of choice and valuable Books, and daily increa&s;ing, with the Income of 116<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> &s;ettled to buy Books for ever, and to afford a competent Salary for a Library-keeper. There is al&s;o a large School for the Ho&s;pital Boys, where they are daily in&s;tructed, and taught to read and write.</P>
<P>The Publick School was founded, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1519, by <HI>Hugh Oldham,</HI> D. D. Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exeter</HI>; and the Revenues left by him are, of late, very much in|crea&s;ed, and the School has been &s;uitably improved from them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e publick Benefactions and Endow|ments, there have been &s;everal other con&s;iderable Sums of Money, and annual Revenues, left and be|queathed to the Poor of the &s;aid Town, who are thereby, with the Kindne&s;s and Charity of the pre|&s;ent Inhabitants, competently provided for, without &s;tarving at Home, or being forced to &s;eek Relief Abroad.</P>
<P>As for the Antiquity of the Place, it is the <HI>Man|cunium</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI>; and what is now called <HI>Knock|ca&s;tle,</HI> was the Scite of the <HI>Roman Ca&s;trum</HI>; and many Antiquities have been found here. The Foun|dation of the Ca&s;tle Wall and Ditch &s;till remain in <HI>Ca&s;tlefield,</HI> as &s;ome time called.</P>
<P>The new Church I have mentioned, was fini&s;hed about the Year 1723, by voluntary Sub&s;criptions: the Choir is Alcove-fa&s;hion, and the Pila&s;ters painted of <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> Colour. The old Church is very large, and has Three Rows of neat Pillars. They have Looms that work 24 Laces at a time, an Invention they borrow'd from the <HI>Dutch.</HI> For the Space of Three Miles upwards, they have no le&s;s than 60 Water-mills. The Town &s;tands chiefly on a Rock, and acro&s;s the River, the large Town, as it may be called, is named <HI>Salthorp.</HI></P>
<P>The Antiquity of the Manufacture is, indeed, worth taking notice of, which, tho' we cannot trace
<PB N="222" REF="223">
it by Hi&s;tory, we have rea&s;on to believe began &s;ome|thing earlier than the Woollen Manufactures in other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> of which I have &s;poken &s;o often; becau&s;e the Cotton might it&s;elf come from the <HI>Me|diterranean,</HI> and be known by Corre&s;pondents in tho&s;e Counties, when that of Wool was not pu&s;hed at, becau&s;e our Neighbours wrought the Goods; and tho' they bought the Wooll from <HI>England,</HI> yet we did not want the Goods: whereas, without making the Cotton Goods at Home, our People could not have them at all; and that Nece&s;&s;ity, which is the Mother of Invention, might put them upon this; and without &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity, Ignorance and Nece&s;&s;ity prevented the other.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Irwell</HI> runs clo&s;e by <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and receives the little River <HI>Irke</HI> ju&s;t above on the North and North-ea&s;t Side. There is a very firm, but antient Stone Bridge over the <HI>Irwell,</HI> which is built exceeding high, becau&s;e this River, tho' not great, yet coming from the mountainous Part of the Coun|try, &s;wells &s;ometimes &s;o &s;uddenly, that in one Night's time they told me Waters would frequently ri&s;e Four or Five Yards, and the next Day fall as ha&s;tily as they ro&s;e.</P>
<P>About Eight Miles from <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> North-we&s;t, lies <HI>Bolton.</HI> We &s;aw nothing remarkable in it, but that the Cotton Manufacture reached hither, tho' the Place did not, like <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> &s;eem increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>Here the old Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> was beheaded, <HI>Oct.</HI> 15. 1651, for proclaiming King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>As I have noted above, we turned Ea&s;t here, and came to <HI>Bury,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town on the River <HI>Roch,</HI> which is the utmo&s;t Bound of the Cotton Manufacture, which flouri&s;hes &s;o well at <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. And here the Woollen Manufacture of coar&s;e Sorts, called <HI>Half-thicks</HI> and <HI>Ker&s;ies,</HI> begins, which imploys this, and all the Villages about it.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">From thence we went to <HI>Rochdale,</HI> a Market-town of good Traffick, a larger, and more populous Town than <HI>Bury</HI>; it lies under the Hills called <HI>Black&s;tone Edge</HI>; which having mentioned, at my Entrance this Way into <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> I mu&s;t now go back again to the Sea Coa&s;t; for I took my Cour&s;e that Way up to <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> in this Jour|ney, having travelled thus far from <HI>Liverpoole,</HI> in my former Journey to <HI>Halifax,</HI> &amp;c. But mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that there are on this Ea&s;tern Side of the County, Northward of <HI>Rochdale,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Ha&s;lington, Burnley</HI> and <HI>Coln,</HI> which lie ju&s;t under the Moun|tains; and likewi&s;e <HI>Blackburn</HI> and <HI>Clithero,</HI> a little We&s;t of them: all which being merely Market-towns, and of no other Note, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of them, other than that <HI>Clithero</HI> &s;tands upon the <HI>Ribble,</HI> and is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable; and that at <HI>Coln</HI> and <HI>Burnley</HI> have been di&s;covered a great many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins.</P>
<P>I take <HI>Wigan</HI> fir&s;t, in my Way back to the Sea Coa&s;t: it lies on the high Po&s;t-road to <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> This Town has a good Market, and is noted for its Manufacture in Coverlids, Rugs, Blankets, and other Sort of Bedding Furniture; and likewi&s;e for Pit-coal, and Iron-work.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Wigan</HI> and <HI>Bolton,</HI> in the E&s;tate of Sir <HI>Roger Brad&s;haw,</HI> is found great Plenty of what they call <HI>Canel</HI> or <HI>Candle Coal,</HI> the like of which is not to be &s;een in <HI>Britain,</HI> or perhaps in the World. By putting a lighted Candle to them, they are pre|&s;ently in a Flame, and yet hold Fire as long as any Coals whatever, and burn more or le&s;s as they are placed in the Grate flat or edgewi&s;e. They are &s;mooth and &s;leek, when the Pieces part from one an|other, and will poli&s;h like Alaba&s;ter. A Lady may take them up in a Cambrick Hankerchief, and they will not &s;oil it, tho' they are as black as the deepe&s;t Jet. They are the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and agreeable Fuel
<PB N="224" REF="225">
that can be found; but are &s;o remote from <HI>London,</HI> that the Carriage makes them too dear for common U&s;e. We &s;aw &s;ome of them at <HI>Warrington</HI> too; but all from the &s;ame Pits.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over the <HI>Burning Well,</HI> as it is called, near <HI>Wigan</HI>; the Account of which take in the Words of Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s Conti|nuator: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"Within a Mile and a half of <HI>Wigan</HI> is a Well, which does not appear to be a Spring, but rather Rain-water, at fir&s;t Sight. There is nothing about it that &s;eems extraordinary; but, upon emptying it, there pre&s;ently breaks out a &s;ulphureous Va|pour, which makes the Water bubble up as if it boiled: a Candle being put to it, it pre&s;ently takes Fire, and burns like Brandy; the Flame in a calm Sea&s;on will continue a whole Day; by the Heat whereof they can boil Eggs, Meat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' the Water it&s;elf be cold. By this Bubbling the Water does not increa&s;e, but is only kept in Motion by the &s;udden <HI>Halitus</HI> of the Vapours breaking out. The &s;ame Water, taken out of the Well, will not burn; as neither the Mud upon which the <HI>Halitus</HI> has beat."</P></Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> in his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory of</HI> Lanca&s;hire, not only de&s;cribes it, but accounts very judiciou&s;ly for the Thing it&s;elf, and by it for the Warmth of all hot Baths.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame Road, a little South, &s;tands <HI>Newton,</HI> which had once a Market, but is now difu&s;ed. It is only noted for a very eminent Charity-&s;chool, founded in 1707, by one <HI>Hornby,</HI> a Yeoman of the &s;ame Place. The poorer Sort of Children are taught to read, write, and ca&s;t Accounts, and have Dinners every School-day be&s;ides. There are al&s;o Ten Boys and Ten Girls, who lodge in an Ho&s;pital contiguous to the School, where they are provided with all other Nece&s;&s;aries till 14 Years old. The Fund for this
<PB N="225" REF="226">
Charity was 2000<HI>l.</HI> A large Sum for a Yeoman to give!</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Orm&s;kirk</HI> We&s;t, towards the Sea-coa&s;t. It is a Market-town that has a good Inland-trade; but we &s;aw nothing remarkable here, but the Monuments of &s;ome of the antient Family of the <HI>Stanleys,</HI> before they were ennobled. And here they &s;till continue to bury the Family, who&s;e Seat is called <HI>Latham,</HI> not far from this Town; to which belongs a very large E&s;tate, and a fine Park. <HI>La|tham</HI> Hou&s;e is noted for having been gallantly de|fended in the late Civil Wars by a Woman, the Lady <HI>Charlotte,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Derby,</HI> who held it to the la&s;t Extremity again&s;t the Parliament Forces, which could never reduce her to capitulate; but kept the Place gloriou&s;ly, till &s;he was relieved by Prince <HI>Ru|pert.</HI> It was, however, ruined in a &s;econd Siege, and is now &s;old out of the Family, and in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Thomas Bootle,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who is building a magnifi|cent Hou&s;e there.</P>
<P><HI>Fernby,</HI> a Village, lies near the Sea-&s;ide, in the mar&s;hy Grounds, where they dig Turf, that &s;erves both for Fire and Candle. The&s;e mar&s;hy Grounds extend a great Way North up, beyond <HI>Eccle&s;ton,</HI> and almo&s;t up to <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI> On the Edge of it Ea&s;tward is <HI>Marton Mere,</HI> which has been very large; but much of it is now drained.</P>
<P><HI>Eccle&s;ton</HI> is a Market-town, where nothing remark|able is to be &s;een: Nor at <HI>Charley,</HI> a Town of the &s;ame Kind; which lies a little North-ea&s;t of it.</P>
<P><HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> &s;tands next, a corporate Mayor Town, having Three weekly Markets, well &s;upplied and fre|quented. It is a large fine Town, &s;ituated on the <HI>Ribble:</HI> it is pretty full of People, but not like <HI>Li|verpoole</HI> or <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>; for we now come beyond the trading Part of the County. But tho' there is no Manufacture, the Town being honoured with the <HI>Court of Chancery,</HI> and the Officers of Ju&s;tices for
<PB N="226" REF="227">
<HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> is full of Gentlemen, Attorneys, Proctors, and Notaries, the Proce&s;s of Law being here of a different Nature from that in other Places, by rea&s;on that it is a Duchy and County Palatine, and has particular Privileges of its own. The People are gay here, tho' not perhaps the richer for that; but it has, on this Account, obtained the Name of <HI>Proud Pre&s;ton.</HI> Here is a great deal of good Company, but not &s;o much, they &s;ay, as was before the late bloody Action with the Northern Rebels; not that the Battle hurt many of the immediate Inhabitants, but the Con&s;e|quences of it &s;o &s;everely affected many Families there|about, that they &s;till retain the Remembrance of it.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> is <HI>Ribche&s;ter,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Bretonomacum</HI> of the Antients; a Town which in its flouri&s;hing State was &s;aid to be the riche&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> So many Pieces of Antiquity have been dug up in its Neighbourhood, that it was mo&s;t probably a Place of great Importance among the an|tient <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>Between the <HI>Ribble,</HI> and a little River &s;ome Miles South of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the Land elbows out, in the Form of a Semi-circle, into the Sea; and this Tract they call the <HI>Field-lands,</HI> in which is a &s;mall Market-town, called <HI>Kirkham</HI>; only remarkable for a good Free-&s;chool which has Three Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>Poulton</HI> is another Market-town in the &s;ame Tract, very convenient in its Situation for Trade, being near the Mouth of the River <HI>Wire.</HI> We followed the Po&s;t|road, and pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Gar&s;tang,</HI> which &s;tands upon it, about Midway between <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and is of no other Note than having a Market; and &s;o leaving <HI>Wiredale</HI> Fore&s;t on our Right, we ar|rived at</P>
<P><HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the County Town, &s;ituate near the Mouth of the River <HI>Lone,</HI> or <HI>Lune.</HI> The Town is antient, and has little el&s;e to recommend it than that, and to have given Title to many Branches of
<PB N="227" REF="228">
the Royal Family of <HI>England.</HI> It has a decayed Ca&s;tle, and a more decayed Port, not capable of re|ceiving Ships of any con&s;iderable Burden. The Bridge has Five Arches, and is hand&s;ome and &s;trong; but here is little or no Trade, and few People. It &s;ur|pri&s;ed me to hear, that there are not above 60 Pari&s;hes in all this large County; but many of them are con|&s;equently very large, and there are above 120 Chapels of Ea&s;e, no le&s;s than 16 of which are in one Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> is now the County Gaol, and the A&s;&s;izes are held in it. The Town has only one Pari&s;h Church, which is fair and &s;pacious.</P>
<P>It is governed by a Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to whom <HI>Edw.</HI> III. granted the Privilege, That Pleas and Se&s;&s;ions in the County &s;hould be held no-where but at <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> It is the <HI>Longovicum</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who have had a Station here. On the &s;teepe&s;t Side of the Hill below the Church hangs a Piece of a <HI>Roman</HI> Wall called <HI>Wery-wall,</HI> derived, as <HI>Camden</HI> thinks, from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Caerwirdd,</HI> a green City, from the Verdure of the Hills.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be owned, however, that here are &s;ome very plea&s;ant manufacturing Towns, and con&s;e|quently populous.</P>

<P>The Upper, or Northern Part of the County, has Two manufacturing Towns, called <HI>Kirkby-Stephen,</HI> and <HI>Appleby</HI>; the la&s;t is the Capital of the County, has a Free-&s;chool and Ho&s;pital, and is the only Town in the County that &s;ends Members to Par|liament.

<P>My Lord <HI>Lon&s;dale,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Louther,</HI> had a very noble and antient Seat at <HI>Louther,</HI> and upon the River <HI>Louther,</HI> which all together add a Dignity to the Family, and are Te&s;ts of its Antiquity.

<P>Near the River <HI>Louther</HI> is a Spring, which ebbs and flows &s;everal times in a Day.</P>
<P>In this County the noble Family of <HI>Wharton</HI> had their Seat in a Place of the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>When we enter'd at the South Part of this County, I began indeed to think of <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> and the

Mountains of <HI>Snowden</HI> in <HI>North Wales,</HI> &s;eeing nothing round me, in many Places, but unpa&s;&s;able Hills, who&s;e Tops, covered with Snow, &s;eemed to tell us, all the plea&s;ant Part of <HI>England</HI> was at an End. The great <HI>Winander Mere,</HI> extending it&s;elf like a Sea, on the We&s;t Side, from <HI>North Bridge</HI> on the South, where it contracts it&s;elf again into a River, up to <HI>Gre&s;emere</HI> North, and is the Boundary of the County, as I have &s;aid, on that Side; and the <HI>Engli&s;h Apen|nines,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the Mountains of <HI>York|&s;hire</HI> North-riding, lie like a Wall of Bra&s;s on the other; and indeed in the mo&s;t literal Sen&s;e they are &s;o: for it is the Opinion of the mo&s;t &s;kilful and knowing People in the County, that they are full of inexhau&s;tible Mines of Copper, which is convertible into Bra&s;s, and a Quantity of Gold in them al&s;o: nay, of late Years, they worked at &s;ome Copper Mines here; but the Ore lies &s;o deep, and is &s;o hard to come at, that they did not &s;eem to go chearfully on.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the terrible A&s;pect of the Hills, when we had pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Kendal,</HI> and de&s;cended from the frightful Mountains, the flat Country began to &s;hew it&s;elf; and we &s;oon found the North and North|ea&s;t Part of the County to be plea&s;ant, rich, fruitful, and, if compared to the other Part, may be &s;aid to be populous.

<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;ettled here by Force of Arms, they were always hara&s;s'd by the <HI>Picts,</HI> on the Side of <HI>Scotland.</HI> To &s;top their Inroads, the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> cau&s;ed a Wall of Earth to be built, ex|tending from the <HI>German</HI> to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, the Space of 80 Miles, or 27 <HI>French</HI> Leagues, and cau&s;ed it to be pali&s;ado'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 123. <HI>Severus,</HI> the Emperor, built it up of Stone, with Turrets from Mile to Mile, and kept a Gari&s;on therein.

<P>In the Town is a very good Free-&s;chool, found|ed by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Grindal,</HI> who was born here.

<P>The Library annexed to this Foundation is very valuable, and &s;till increa&s;ing by &s;everal Gifts daily added to it. Tho' the Pari&s;h is va&s;tly large, the Vi|carage is very poorly endowed.</P>

<P>This Increa&s;e of Shipping has led them on to Mer|chandizing; but the Town is but of few Years &s;tanding in Trade: for Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> does not &s;o much as name the Place, and his Continuator &s;ays very little of it.</P>
<P>And indeed the Town mu&s;t be allow'd to owe principally its flouri&s;hing Condition to Two Acts of Parliament, one of the 7th, the other of the 11th of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> by virtue of which the Harbour was &s;o con&s;iderably deepened and improved, and &s;uch &s;trong and &s;ub&s;tantial Moles and Bulwarks erected, that Ships, which before were liable to be driven and ca&s;t away on the Rocks and Shoals on that Coa&s;t, could lie in Safety, and be &s;ecure from the Vio|lence of the Sea. The happy Succe&s;s of the&s;e Works encourag'd the Town to apply to Parliament for Powers &s;till farther to improve the good De&s;ign, that &s;o, by inlarging the Moles and Works, and extending them to Low-water Mark, &s;uch Depth might be obtained, that the large&s;t Ships belonging to the Town might &s;ail in and out of the Harbour at Neap Tides, and that other Ships frequenting the&s;e Seas, might &s;ail in at Half-flood. And accordingly an Act pa&s;&s;ed for this laudable Purpo&s;e, in the Self. 1739-40, which will prebably effectuate the&s;e good Ends, and not only pre&s;erve the Lives of many Mariners, but &s;till further improve the Trade and Navigation of this already flouri&s;hing Town. The &s;ame Act pro|vides likewi&s;e for the Repair of the Roads about and

In Con&s;equence of this Act, the Pier was rebuilt, and the Harbour made capable of receiving &s;everal &s;mall Ships, and a Trade for Coals to <HI>Ireland</HI> and other Parts commenced. This gave Encouragement for another Act, which pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Anno</HI> 1732, to inlarge the Term for 21 Years after the Expiration of the former, in order to make the Har|bour &s;till more complete, for the Reception of Ships of greater Burden, and to inlarge the River, clean&s;e the Harbour, and to bring into it a &s;mall Brook, called <HI>Mare&s;by-beck,</HI> which runs near it.

If we took the Road to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> it u&s;ed to be the &s;ame through the Vale of <HI>Aile&s;bury</HI> to <HI>Buck|ingham,</HI> and We&s;tward to <HI>Banbury, Keynton,</HI> and the Vale of <HI>Eve&s;ham,</HI> where the Clays reach, with &s;ome Intermi&s;&s;ions, even to the Bank of <HI>Severn,</HI> as they do more Northerly quite to <HI>We&s;t-Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>This natural Difficulty of the Soil thro' all the midland Country, where the Carriage at the &s;ame time was &s;o prodigious, and made &s;ome of the Highways in a manner impa&s;&s;able, nece&s;&s;arily brought the Country to apply to Parliament; and the Con|&s;equence has been, that Turnpikes or Toll-bars have been &s;et up on the &s;everal great Roads of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> beginning at <HI>London,</HI> and proceeding thro' almo&s;t all tho&s;e dirty deep Roads, in the Midland Counties e&s;pecially; at which Turnpikes all Car|riages, Droves of Cattle, and Travellers on Hor&s;e|back, are obliged to pay an ea&s;y Toll; which bears no Compari&s;on with the Benefit reap'd thereby: and 'tis well worth recording, for the Honour of the pre&s;ent Age, that this Work has been begun, and is in an extraordinary manner carry'd on, and perhaps may, in a great mea&s;ure, be completed within our Memory, as to the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dan|gerous Roads in the Kingdom. And this is a Work of &s;o much general Good, that certainly no publick Edifice, Alms-hou&s;e, Ho&s;pital, or Nobleman's Pa|lace, can be of equal Value to the Country with this, nor at the &s;ame time more an Honour and Or|nament to it.</P>
<P>The Benefit of the&s;e Turnpikes appears now to be &s;o great, and the People in all Places begin to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, that it is incredible what Effect it has already had upon Trade in the Counties where
<PB N="250" REF="255">
the Roads are completely fini&s;hed; even the Car|riage of Goods is abated, in &s;ome Places, 6<HI>d. per</HI> hundred Weight; in others, 12<HI>d. per</HI> Hundred; which is abundantly more Advantage to Commerce, than the Charge paid amounts to; and yet at the &s;ame time the Expence is paid by the Carriers too, who make the Abatement; &s;o that the Benefit in abating the Rate of Carriage is wholly and &s;imply the Trade&s;mens, not the Carriers.</P>
<P>Yet the Advantage is evident to the latter al&s;o another way; for they can bring more Weight with the &s;ame Number of Hor&s;es, nor are their Hor&s;es &s;o hard-work'd and fatigu'd with their Labour as they were before; in which one Particular 'tis ac|knowleged by the Carriers, they perform their Work with more Ea&s;e, and the Ma&s;ters are at le&s;s Expence.</P>
<P>The Advantage is al&s;o inexpre&s;&s;ible to all other kinds of Travelling; &s;uch as the Safety and Ea&s;e to Gentlemen journeying up to <HI>London</HI> on all Occa|&s;ions, whether to the Term, to Parliament, to Court, or on any other nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Riding Po&s;t, as well for the ordinary carrying of the Mails, as for Gentlemen, when their Occa&s;ions require Speed, is made extremely ea&s;y, &s;afe and plea&s;ant, by this Alteration of the Roads.</P>
<P>The Safety of Travelling on this Occa&s;ion is the more to be in&s;i&s;ted on, becau&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the&s;e Repairs of the Highways do daily order Bridges to be repair'd and inlarg'd, and new ones built, where they find Occa&s;ion; which not only &s;erve to carry the Water off, where it otherwi&s;e often &s;preads, and lies, as it were, damm'd up upon the Road, and &s;poils the Way, but where it ri&s;es &s;ometimes by &s;udden Rains to a dangerous Height; for it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that there is more Hazard, and more Lives lo&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing, or attempting to pa&s;s, little Brooks and Streams, which are &s;well'd by &s;udden
<PB N="251" REF="256">
Showers of Rain, and where Pa&s;&s;engers expect no Stoppage, than in pa&s;&s;ing great Rivers, where the Danger is known, and therefore more carefully avoided.</P>
<P>In many of the&s;e Places the Commi&s;&s;ioners have not only built large and &s;ub&s;tantial Bridges, but have &s;et up Sluices to &s;top, and open Chanels to carry off the Waters, where they u&s;ed to &s;well into the Highway: and I have been told, Years ago, that the &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ioners, in the re&s;pective Di&s;tricts, where they are concerned, had then built between 300 and 400 new Bridges, where there were none before, or where the former were &s;mall, and in&s;uffi|cient to carry the Traveller &s;afe over the Waters. Many of the&s;e are within a few Miles of <HI>London,</HI> e&s;pecially, for Example, on the great Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Edgeworth,</HI> from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Enfield,</HI> from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Croydon,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Benefits accruing from this laudable Method, we may add, the Conveniency to tho&s;e who bring fat Cattle, e&s;pecially Sheep, to <HI>London</HI> in the Winter, from the remoter Counties of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> where they are bred: for, before, the Country Graziers were oblig'd to &s;ell their Stocks off in <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> when the Roads be|gan to be bad, and when they generally &s;ell cheap; and the Butchers and Farmers near <HI>London</HI> u&s;ed to engro&s;s them, and keep them till <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> and then &s;ell them, tho' not an Ounce fatter than before, for an advanced Price, to the Citizens of <HI>London</HI>; whereas now the Roads are in a Way to be made every-where pa&s;&s;able, the City will be &s;erv'd with Mutton almo&s;t as cheap in the Winter as in the Summer, or the Profit of the Advance will be to the Country Graziers, who are the original Breeders, and take all the Pains.</P>
<P>This is evidenced to a Demon&s;tration in the Coun|ties where the Roads are already repair'd, from
<PB N="252" REF="257">
whence they bring their fat Cattle, and particularly their Mutton, in Droves, from Sixty, Seventy, or Eighty Miles, without fatiguing, hara&s;&s;ing, or &s;ink|ing the Fle&s;h of the Creatures, even in the Depth of Winter.</P>
<P>I might give Examples of other Branches of In|land Commerce, which are, and &s;till will be further alter'd for the better, by this Repairing the Roads, and particularly that of carrying Chee&s;e; a Species of Provi&s;ion &s;o con&s;iderable, that nothing, except that of live Cattle, can exceed it.</P>
<P>This is chiefly made in the Three <HI>North-we&s;t</HI> Counties of <HI>England,</HI> viz. <HI>Che&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> and the Parts adjacent, from whence the Nation u&s;ed to be very meanly &s;upply'd, by rea&s;on of the great Di&s;tance of the Country where the Chee&s;e is made, from tho&s;e where it is chiefly expended.</P>
<P>The <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Men indeed carry great Quantities about by long Sea, as they call it, to <HI>London</HI>; a ter|rible long, and &s;ometimes dangerous, Voyage, being thro' the <HI>Iri&s;h Chanel,</HI> round all <HI>Wales,</HI> cro&s;s the <HI>Bri&s;tol Chanel,</HI> round the <HI>Land's End</HI> of <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> and up the <HI>Engli&s;h Chanel</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and &s;o up to <HI>London</HI>; or el&s;e by Land to <HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> and &s;o down that River to <HI>Gainsborough</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> and &s;o by Sea to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> Men carry all by Land-Carriage to <HI>Lechlade</HI> and <HI>Cricklade</HI> on the <HI>Thames,</HI> and &s;o carry it down the River to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> Men have no Water-Car|riage at all, or at lea&s;t not till they have carry'd it a long Way by Land to <HI>Oxford</HI>; but as their Quan|tity is exceeding great, and they &s;upply not only the City of <HI>London,</HI> but al&s;o the Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Hertford, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Northampton,</HI> the Gro&s;s of their Car|riage is by mere dead Draught; and they carry it
<PB N="253" REF="258">
either to <HI>London</HI> by Land, which is full 100 Miles, and &s;o the <HI>London</HI> Chee&s;emongers &s;upply the &s;aid Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> by Sea and River Navigation; or the <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> Men carry it by Land once a Year to <HI>Sturbridge</HI> Fair, whence the Shop-keepers of all the Inland Country above-nam'd come to buy it; in all which Ca&s;es Land-Carriage being long, when the Ways were generally bad, it made it very dear to the Poor, who are the chief Con&s;umers.</P>
<P>I could al&s;o inlarge here upon the Convenience that accrues to the Trade in fre&s;h Fi&s;h, from the Sea Coa&s;ts to the Inner Parts of the Kingdom, whither, when the Ways are bad, they cannot carry them &s;weet. This of cour&s;e mu&s;t greatly increa&s;e the Con&s;umption of Fi&s;h in its Sea&s;on, and imploy a con&s;iderable Number of Hor&s;es and Men, as well as increa&s;e the Shipping by that Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>By this I do not only mean the carrying of Her|rings and Mackerel to <HI>London,</HI> as is practi&s;ed on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> in particular, and bring|ing Salmon from the remote Rivers of <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Trent</HI>; but the carrying of Herrings, Mackerel, and Sprats in their Sea&s;on, and Whitings and flat Fi&s;h at other times, from the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Yarmouth, Swole, Ip&s;wich, Colche&s;ter, Malden,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;upplying all the Inland Counties with them &s;weet and good, even as far as <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Coventry,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might give Examples where the Herrings, which are not the be&s;t Fi&s;h to keep, u&s;ed, even before the&s;e Reparations were &s;et on foot, to be carried to tho&s;e Towns, and up to <HI>Warwick, Birmingham, Tam|worth</HI> and <HI>Stafford</HI>; and tho' they frequently &s;tunk before they got thither, yet the People were &s;o eager for them, that they bought them up at a dear Rate; whereas when the Roads are every-where good, they will come in le&s;s Time, by at lea&s;t Two Days

<P>The&s;e, and many others, are the Advantages to our Inland Commerce, which we may have room to hope for upon the general Repair of the Roads, and which I &s;hall have great Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of again in my <HI>Northern</HI> Circuit.</P>
<P>Nor are the laudable Undertakings which have of late Years been &s;et on foot for rendering many of the Inland Rivers of this Kingdom navigable, a le&s;s profitable Improvement to the Publick, many of which have been completed, and others are com|pleting, according to Acts of Parliament already pa&s;&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e; many of which I have taken notice of, in the Cour&s;e of my Letters. And hardly a Se&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;es, but Bills are &s;till continued to be brought in for making others navigable.

<HEAD>LETTER V. GIVING A brief Account of the I&s;les of <HI>Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Alderney,</HI> and <HI>Sarke.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THAT nothing may be wanting to complete this Work, I &s;hall briefly in this Place touch upon the I&s;les of <HI>Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Alderney</HI> and <HI>Sarke,</HI> which are the only Remains of the Dukedom of <HI>Normandy,</HI> now in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown. And, fir&s;t, of JER|SEY.</P>
<P>Various Names have been affix'd to this I&s;land: in the Time of the <HI>Romans</HI> it was nam'd <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> proba|bly from the Dictator, who &s;ubdued &s;everal Nations along this Tract: which Conjecture is confirm'd by the pre&s;ent Name of one of its Forts, which is <HI>Le Fort de C&eacute;&s;ar.</HI> In the North of the I&s;land, at <HI>Ro&s;el,</HI> is an Intrenchment pre&s;erving the Name of <HI>La pe|tite C&eacute;&s;ar&eacute;e.</HI> That the <HI>Romans</HI> were here, is plain from the Remains of an antient Camp near the Ma|nor of <HI>Dilament</HI>; as al&s;o from Coins which have been found in different Parts of the I&s;land, particu|larly
<PB N="256" REF="265">
One of <HI>Commodus,</HI> and Two of <HI>Probus</HI> and <HI>Po&s;thumus,</HI> all in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. O&ucirc;en.</HI> Its mo|dern Appellation is no more than a Corruption of its old one, <HI>Jer</HI> being a Contraction of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Ey</HI> &s;ignifying I&s;land, q. d. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s I&s;land. <HI>Augia</HI> was a Name &s;till elder than the Time when the <HI>Romans</HI> were acquainted with the Place; and &s;up|po&s;ed to be the original one.</P>
<P>The I&s;land has &s;u&s;tained &s;everal Revolutions: fir&s;t, by <HI>Rollo,</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy.</HI> 2. By the <HI>French.</HI> 3. By the <HI>Normans</HI> re&s;tored. 4. By the Uniting of it to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The Inhabitants behav'd very valiantly in Defence of <HI>Charles</HI> I. and his Son <HI>Charles</HI> II. but were at la&s;t reduced by the irre&s;i&s;tible Power of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Par|liament, altho' they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the la&s;t who &s;ubmitted to the common Fate of the Times, by a Capitulation equally advantageous and honourable.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to give as clear an Account of the Situation and remarkable Places of this I&s;land as the Narrowne&s;s of our Limits will admit.</P>
<P><HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> is computed to be 49&deg; 10&prime; N. L. and 2&deg; 20&prime; W. L. from the Meridian of <HI>London.</HI> Its Length is 12 Miles; its utmo&s;t Breadth between Six and Seven. Its North-&s;ide, from its lofty Cliffs, is 40 or 50 Fathoms perpendicular from the Sea; which renders it inacce&s;&s;ible that way; but the South is much lower, and almo&s;t level with the Water. Its Form &s;eems to re&s;emble a Wedge, or a rectangular Triangle.</P>
<P>The higher Lands are diver&s;ify'd by gritty and gravelly, &s;tony and rocky, fine and &s;weet Mould; the lower by heavy, deep and rich Soil. All kinds of Fore&s;t and Fruit-trees, Shrubs, Roots, Flowers and Herbs, flouri&s;h here, with Pul&s;e and Corn, tho' their Wheat is &s;maller than <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="266">The Decay of Tillage (&s;o evident in this I&s;le) is owing to three Cau&s;es: 1. The Increa&s;e of the Stocken Manufacture; which naturally inclined the People to &s;light the more laborious Imployment of Agriculture. 2. The Improvement of Navigation, and Foreign Traffick, which had the &s;ame Effect. 3. The Culture of Cyder, by converting the Arable Lands into Orchards for that Purpo&s;e; which Com|modity is the ordinary Drink of the Inhabitants, who are now over-&s;tock'd with it; &s;o that there is Hope of their returning to the Plough, and to their former Indu&s;try. 4. The Increa&s;e of Inclo&s;ures and High|ways; of the latter whereof here are three Sorts; the fir&s;t call'd <HI>Le Chemin du Roy,</HI> or The King's High-way, &s;ixteen Feet in Breadth; the &s;econd, <HI>Le Chemin de huit Pieds,</HI> or The Eight-foot way, which with its Sides makes up 12 Feet; and the third, <HI>Le Chemin de quatre Pieds,</HI> or the Four-foot Way, for Hor&s;e-carriages.</P>
<P>On the Rocks about the I&s;land, Sea-weed grows plentifully, which is an Equivalent for the Deficiency of other Things u&s;eful in Hu&s;bandry, and is the common Manure of the Land in <HI>Jer&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>Here is Plenty of good Water from the inex|hau&s;tible Stores of Springs gu&s;hing from the nume|rous <HI>Strata</HI> of Rocks every-where con&s;picuous. Meat al&s;o and Butter are equally good and &s;weet here, tho' the Cattle are inferior in Size to tho&s;e el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The Ewes of this I&s;le had four Horns, but the Rams &s;ix, in <HI>Camden</HI>'s Time, tho' rarely now to be &s;een. Fowl of all Kinds are here in great Quan|tities. But none of the volatile Tribe exceed in Beauty the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> Partridge, having the bright Eyes natural to that Bird, red Legs, and variegated Feathers. The Fle&s;h however is not much preferable to that of the common Partridge.</P>
<P>This I&s;land abounds with Fi&s;h, the Species of which we may range thus: 1. Rough-coated Fi&s;h,
<PB N="258" REF="267">
&s;uch as Rou&s;&s;es, Haus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the coar&s;e&s;t of all. 2. Shell and Rock-fi&s;h, among which is the <HI>Ormer,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed peculiar to the&s;e Parts, and deriving its Name, which is <HI>French,</HI> from its Re&s;emblance, to a human Ear. The In&s;ide of the Shell is made u&s;e of in inlaid Works, as Mother of Pearl, to the bright Colour of which it approaches. There is no Under-&s;hell; but the Fi&s;h adheres to the Rock with its Back, and is a &s;olid Ma&s;s of white Pulp, very grateful to the Ta&s;te, which it regales like the Fle&s;h of Land Animals. In great Spring Tides, at low-water Mark, it is found. 3. Flat-fi&s;h, as Rays, Thornbacks, Soles, Plai&s;e, large Turbots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4. Scale-fi&s;h. Of the&s;e, one Draught of Ba&s;e has equall'd a Cart-load. Be|&s;ides which here is the Mullet, red and grey, the Vrac, or Sea-carp, and the Bar, an exqui&s;ite Fi&s;h, &s;ometimes two Feet in Length. Other Fi&s;h here are, which for their Singularity we cannot pa&s;s by in Silence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gronnard</HI> is &s;o call'd from its <HI>grunting</HI> Noi&s;e, when taken. Its Head is almo&s;t as big as the Body, and its Colour is a deep Scarlet, re&s;embling Blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lan&ccedil;on</HI> (or <HI>little Lance,</HI> from its Shape) is never found in the Water, but in &s;ome moving Sand|bank de&s;erted by the Sea; when the Sand being mov'd with an iron Hook, the Fi&s;h &s;pring up, and are caught by Handfuls. The young Men and Maids take great Delight, during the warm Summer Nights, in this Sport; which is render'd ea&s;y to them by the Gli&s;tering of the Prey above the Sand. This they term <HI>aller au Lan&ccedil;on.</HI> It is prepar'd as an Anchovy, and, well-dre&s;s'd, gives an agreeable Reli&s;h.</P>
<P>Another odd Fi&s;h is the <HI>Sirene,</HI> which is furni&s;h'd with Teats like a Woman's.</P>
<P>The ugly, but harmle&s;s, and perhaps whol&s;ome Animal the Toad, abounds here, as do innoxious Creatures of the Serpentine Kind, particularly Li|zards, which gaze on Pa&s;&s;engers, as they lie ba&s;king
<PB N="259" REF="268">
in the Sun. But the wor&s;t of the reptile Kind are Moles, which damage the Corn and Gra&s;s, though they compen&s;ate that Detriment by affording a freer Pa&s;&s;age to the Rain thro' their <HI>Latibula.</HI></P>
<P>The Climate here is in general whol&s;ome; tho' as Luxury has gain'd Ground, Di&s;ea&s;es unknown to former Ages have been its con&s;tant Attendants: &s;o that it cannot now boa&s;t of that Character given it by <HI>Camden, That here was no Room for the Phy&s;i|cians.</HI></P>
<P>The Rocks are va&s;t and terrible, the Tides rapid and &s;trong; as an Evidence of which, here is no Still-water at any time, as in other Parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Chanel.</P>
<P>The whole I&s;land con&s;i&s;ts of 12 Pari&s;hes, which are divided into <HI>Vintaines,</HI> from the 20 Hou&s;es which formerly, as is &s;aid, con&s;tituted each Pari&s;h; tho' now &s;ome Pari&s;hes va&s;tly exceed that Number. <HI>Cueil|lettes</HI> is the Name for the&s;e Divi&s;ions in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. O&ucirc;en</HI> alone.</P>
<P>But to be more particular: 1. The Pari&s;h ju&s;t mention'd contains &s;ix <HI>Cueillettes,</HI> namely, <HI>De Vin|chel&eacute;s, des Mill&eacute;s, de Leoville, des Gront&eacute;s, Grande Cueillette,</HI> and <HI>Petite Cueillette.</HI> The Seigneur <HI>de St. O&ucirc;en</HI> has a large Pond in the We&s;t of the I&s;land, containing about 20 Acres of Land, wherein are Carp of &s;o extraordinary a Size, as &s;carce to be equalled in <HI>Europe</HI>; &s;ome of them being four Feet four Inches in Length. Part of the great Bay of <HI>St. O&ucirc;en</HI> had been a rich Vale, which was &s;wallow'd up by the Sea.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>St. Peter</HI> contains &s;ix <HI>Vintaines</HI>; which are, <HI>Des Angueres, du Coin Varin, du Doet, de St. Nico|las, de la Vall&eacute;e,</HI> and <HI>Grande Vintaine.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In <HI>St. Brelade</HI> are four <HI>Vintaines</HI>; call'd <HI>Des Quenves, de la Moye, du Coin,</HI> and <HI>de Noirmont.</HI> In this Pari&s;h &s;tands the Town of <HI>St. Aubin,</HI> the &s;econd of the I&s;land; and from it the Bay adjoining
<PB N="260" REF="269">
derives its Name; which con&s;i&s;ts of white Sand, level and firm; and thence the Travelling from this Town to <HI>St. Helier,</HI> the Capital, is render'd &s;mooth and ea&s;y. And as the Church is at a Di&s;tance, and intercepted by a bleak Hill, the Inhabitants, who are in plentiful Circum&s;tances, were building, when I was there, a convenient Chapel by way of Contri|bution. The Port, which is the be&s;t and mo&s;t fre|quented in <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> has a &s;trong Pier, carry'd into the Sea, which receives and affords a &s;afe Harbour for Ships. Here a Sixth-rate ju&s;t floats at a dead Neap, and a Ship of 200 Tons at all times. At Half-flood a Ve&s;&s;el of 130 Tons may find Entrance. Larger Ships indeed, and Men of War, mu&s;t remain in the Road, where is good Anchorage. The Pier joins to the Fort of <HI>St. Aubin,</HI> which renders the Place very defen&s;ible. The&s;e Advantages have brought hither many Merchants and Ma&s;ters of Ships: and every <HI>Monday</HI> is held what is improperly call'd a Market; for it is rather an Exchange, where Mer|chants and others meet for tran&s;acting Affairs of Na|vigation and Traffick. The Hou&s;es are mo&s;tly new.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>St. Mary</HI> has two Vintaines, <HI>Du Nord,</HI> and <HI>du Sud.</HI> In this Pari&s;h was di&s;cover'd a Spring &s;trongly impregnated with a purging Mineral; the Water of which was approved of by Dr. <HI>Charleton,</HI> an eminent <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>St. Laurence</HI> contains four Vintaines; <HI>viz. Du Coin Motier, du Coin Tourgis, du Coin &eacute;s Ha&s;tains,</HI> and <HI>de la Vall&eacute;e.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>St. John</HI> has three Vintaines; which are <HI>Du Nord, du Doet, de Herupe.</HI> In this Pari&s;h is a Hill call'd <HI>Mont-mado,</HI> whereon is a rich Quarry of excel|lent Stone, capable of being cut into regular Squares, like <HI>Portland</HI> Stone.</P>
<P N="7">7. In <HI>Trinity</HI> are five Vintaines, namely, <HI>De la Ville &agrave; l' Eve&s;que, du Rondin, de Ro&s;el, des Augr&eacute;s,</HI> and <HI>de la Croizerie.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="261" REF="270">8. <HI>St. Helier</HI> comprehends four Vintaines, which are, <HI>Du Mont &agrave; l' Abb&eacute;e, du Mont au Pr&eacute;tre, du Mont Cochon,</HI> and <HI>de la Ville.</HI> The Situation of <HI>St. Helier</HI> is plea&s;ant as well as commodious, having on the South-we&s;t the Sea, with a full Pro&s;pect of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Ca&s;tle, and of the Road for Ships. To the North are Hills, which are an excellent Defence again&s;t the Cold: and at their Feet a Flat of Mea|dows inliven'd by a pure Stream, which from hence enters the Streets, and even the Hou&s;es; &s;o that the Water is ea&s;ily brought up by Buckets, let down thro' a Trap-door, or from the Re&s;ervoirs of Wells and Pumps. Another huge Hill projects, in a manner, over the Town; and being a Common, affords to the Cattle Herbage, and to Gentlemen and Ladies an agreeable Walk, with the Advantage of an exten|&s;ive Pro&s;pect. The u&s;ual Name of this Hill is <HI>Le Mont de la Ville.</HI> The unfortunate Duke of <HI>Somer|&s;et,</HI> Protector of the King and Kingdom, had probably intended to protect him&s;elf from the Malice of his Enemies, by building a new Town here, as he did a Citadel at <HI>Alderney</HI>; both which De&s;igns became abortive by his Death. In <HI>St. Helier,</HI> at pre&s;ent, are about 400 Hou&s;es, di&s;po&s;ed into divers wide and well-pav'd Streets. <HI>La Cohue Royale,</HI> or the Seat of Ju&s;tice, &s;tands in a large Quadrangle, on each Side of which are hand&s;ome Structures. Here is held every <HI>Saturday</HI> a Market, or rather a Fair, whither People flock from all Parts of the I&s;land to enjoy their Friends, or tran&s;act Bu&s;ine&s;s. In the Town live few landed Gentlemen, but many Shop|keepers, Artificers, and Retailers of Liquor. Scarce any thing is wanting to the U&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity or Convenience. <HI>La Halle, la Boucherie,</HI> or the Shambles, is a large Room inclo&s;ed, &s;o that the Sight and Smell of Carca&s;es do not here annoy the Eyes and No&s;trils of People, as they do in mo&s;t Country Towns. The Number of Inhabitants, exclu&s;ive of
<PB N="262" REF="271">
&s;ome Hundreds in the Out-Vintaines, who are Pa|ri&s;hioners, tho' not Town&s;men, is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to Two thou&s;and. And the Church, tho' very ca|pacious by the Acce&s;&s;ion of Galleries, when I was there, was crouded with them.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>St. Saviour</HI> has &s;ix Vintaines, of the following Denominations: <HI>De Maufant, de &s;ous la Hogue, des Pigneaux, de &s;ous l' Egli&s;e, de le Grande Longue|ville,</HI> and <HI>de la Petite Longueville.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Under <HI>St. Martin</HI> are comprehended the&s;e five Vintaines: <HI>De Ro&s;el, de la Queru&eacute;e, de &s;ous l' Egli&s;e, du Fief du Roy,</HI> and <HI>de Faldoit.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Gronville</HI> compri&s;es four Vintaines, <HI>De la Rue, des Marais, de Longueville,</HI> and <HI>de la Roque.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. In <HI>St. Clement</HI> are three Vintaines, by Name, <HI>Du Mont Roquier, de Samar&eacute;z,</HI> and <HI>Grand Vin|taine.</HI> In the Canal call'd <HI>Samar&eacute;z</HI> are great Num|bers of Carp and Eel, the only fre&s;h-water Fi&s;h in the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Cueillettes and Vintaines are in all 52. The Buildings are all of Stone, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, in a Country which is nothing but a huge Rock, cover'd with <HI>Strata</HI> of Earth. The common Sort is Rag-&s;tone. The Stone on <HI>Mont-mado,</HI> mention'd above, is of a reddi&s;h White, the whiter the better, of a fine Grain, and may be wrought almo&s;t as &s;leek as poli&s;h'd Marble. The Churches and fine&s;t Edifices are cover'd with blue Slate; the ordinary Hou&s;es are thatch'd with long Wheat-&s;traw.</P>
<P>The principal Trade is that to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> whither, in the Year 1732, were &s;ent 27 Ships, from thence to proceed to the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> in order to di&s;po&s;e of their Fi&s;h. Another Branch of Trade is that of knit Ho&s;e, or Stockens, which are every <HI>Saturday</HI> &s;old at <HI>St. Helier,</HI> to the Merchants; and many thou&s;and Pairs are made weekly in the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Language, as you may gue&s;s from the Names of Places, is <HI>French,</HI> tho' ob&s;olete, and thence to be
<PB N="263" REF="272">
e&s;teem'd barbarous. This Remark, however, is not to be extended to their Religious Wor&s;hip, Judica|tures, or even the Conver&s;ation of the more polite, in all which the pure <HI>French</HI> is u&s;ed. Tho' this is the original Language, yet one may ob&s;erve a pretty good Smattering of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> even among the lower Cla&s;s of People, owing to the Intermixture of the Soldiers in the Gari&s;on at <HI>St. Helier</HI>; in the Church of which Town Prayers are alternately in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Officer, who repre&s;ents the King's Per|&s;on, is the Governor. His Excellency, at the Time when I was there, was the Right Honourable the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Cobham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harli&s;ton</HI> Tower was &s;o call'd from Sir <HI>Richard Harli&s;ton,</HI> Governor of the I&s;land in the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who built it in <HI>Mont Orgueil</HI> Ca&s;tle. The great Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> bore this high Office, to which his Name does Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Mont-Orgueil</HI> is of &s;o great Antiquity, that no Record &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, old enough to determine its Origin. 'Tis at pre&s;ent &s;lighted, and in a ruinous Condition; and what it was formerly, <HI>Elizabeth-Ca&s;tle</HI> now is, equal to any Fortre&s;s within the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions. It is nam'd <HI>Le Ch&acirc;teau de l' I&s;let,</HI> or &s;imply <HI>L' I&s;let,</HI> from its Situation on a &s;mall I&s;land. In Circuit it is little le&s;s than a Mile. In 1551 all the Bells in <HI>Jer|&s;ey,</HI> excepting one to each Church, were &s;old towards defraying the Expence of the Building. In 1586 the <HI>Upper Ward</HI> was erected, which is properly Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, every Hou&s;e in the I&s;land furni&s;hing four Days Work. The <HI>Lower Ward</HI> is King <HI>Charles</HI> I.'s Ca&s;tle, and was begun in 1626. During the Civil War <HI>Charles-Fort</HI> was added; and in 1665, the <HI>French</HI> threatening the Place, the <HI>Green</HI> was inclo&s;ed within a Wall.</P>
<P>The Fort of <HI>St. Aubin</HI> is of good U&s;e towards clearing the Road, and for a Safe-guard to Ships
<PB N="264" REF="273">
within the Pier, which it &s;ecures by its Cannon planted on the Ba&s;tions; tho' in antient Times it was no more than a great Tower on a Rock, thence nam'd <HI>La Tour.</HI></P>
<P>There are five Regiments of regular Forces on the I&s;land, which are reviewed every 29th of <HI>May,</HI> the Anniver&s;ary of the Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>The Civil Government is admini&s;ter'd by a Bailly, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by 12 Jurats.</P>
<P>Here are divers Monuments of the <HI>Druidical Su|per&s;titions,</HI> which are flat Rag-&s;tones, of va&s;t Size and Weight, rai&s;ed three or four Feet from the Ground, and &s;u&s;tain'd by others of le&s;s Bulk. The&s;e the Natives call <HI>Poquelayes</HI>; and are the Altars, on which Sacrifices, often human, were immolated, par|ticularly, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Helier,</HI> three of them contiguous to each other; and on the Summit of a Place call'd <HI>Le Rouge Bouillon,</HI> another; be&s;ides one on <HI>St. Helier's Hill.</HI> Another larger, near <HI>Mont-Orgueil</HI> Ca&s;tle; and near <HI>Ro&s;el-haven,</HI> on a Cliff nam'd <HI>Le Couperon,</HI> an Antiquity &s;eeming to be a little Temple of theirs. At a Place call'd <HI>Les Landes Pallot,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Saviour,</HI> was a Rocking-&s;tone, like that I &s;hall mention in <HI>Scotland,</HI> de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Cromwellians</HI>; erected by the <HI>Druids,</HI> probably to awe the People into a Belief of their Miracles. This al&s;o has been demoli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o Monuments of the <HI>Popi&s;h Super&s;tition</HI>; two more particularly: The fir&s;t call'd <HI>La Chapelle de n&ocirc;tre Dame des Pas,</HI> from the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, who is &s;aid to have left the Print of her Steps on the very Spot of the Rock, whereon the Chapel is erected, and this too after her Body was moulder'd into Du&s;t. The &s;econd is term'd <HI>Hoguebie,</HI> a Chapel over a Tomb, built, according to Tradition, by the di&s;con|&s;olate Widow of the <HI>Seigneur de Hambie,</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> who fell by Treachery in this I&s;land, and who&s;e Lo&s;s was &s;o afflicting to his Lady, that &s;he erected it on
<PB N="265" REF="274">
Purpo&s;e to have the melancholy Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the Place where her Lord's Corps was interr'd, from her Window in <HI>Normandy</HI>; and to procure his Soul the great Benefit of Ma&s;&s;es. Afterwards one <HI>Mabon,</HI> who had been a Pilgrimage to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> took a Fancy to lengthen the Chapel toward the Ea&s;t, and to hollow a Place under the Altar, in order to repre|&s;ent our Lord's Sepulchre. This Place was made the chief Seat of the Popi&s;h Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the prevailing Terrors of the Papal Empire in the Days of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> had the Courage to put to Death <HI>Richard Averty,</HI> a Prie&s;t, and furious Pro&s;e|cutor of the marry'd Clergy, for murdering his Ba|&s;tard Child, which he effected without the Mother's Knowlege.</P>
<P>The Mace, borne before the Bailly and Magi|&s;trates, at the Convention of the States, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has this In&s;cription:
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; Tali haud omnes dignatur honore.</HI></L> CAROLUS Secundus, Magnae Britanniae, Franciae, &amp; Hiberniae Rex &s;ereni&s;&s;imus, affectum regium erga in&s;ulam de JERSEY (in qua bis habuit re|ceptum, dum caeteris ditionibus excluderetur) hocce monumento vere regio po&s;teris con&s;ecra|tum voluit: ju&s;&s;itque ut deinceps Balivis praefe|ratur, in perpetuam memoriam fidei tum au|gu&s;ti&s;&s;imo parenti CAROLO I. tum &s;uae maje|&s;tati, &s;aevientibus bellis civilibus, &s;ervatae a viris clari&s;&s;imis Philippo &amp; Georgio de Carteret, equitibus auratis, hujus in&s;ulae Baliv. &amp; Reg. Praefect.</Q> Of which this is the Tran&s;lation:
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; Not all are with &s;uch Honour grac'd.</HI></L> CHARLES the Second, the mo&s;t &s;erene King of <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> has re&s;olved,
<PB N="266" REF="275">
that his Royal Favour towards the I&s;le of JER|SEY, (in which he twice met with a Place of Refuge, while he was excluded from the re&s;t of his Dominions) &s;hould be con&s;ecrated to Po&s;terity by this truly Royal Monument: And commanded, that thenceforward it &s;hould be borne before the Baillies, in perpetual Memory of the Loyalty pre&s;erv'd both to his mo&s;t Augu&s;t Father CHARLES I. and to his Maje&s;ty, during the Rage of the Civil Wars, by the mo&s;t ex|cellent Men Sir <HI>Philip</HI> and Sir <HI>George de Car|teret,</HI> Knights, Baillies and Chief Governors of this I&s;land.</Q></P>
<P>St. <HI>Magloire,</HI> the Apo&s;tle of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> lies bury'd in a little Chapel near a Free-&s;chool, corruptly call'd from him <HI>L' Ecole de St. Magloire,</HI> and founded, with another nam'd <HI>St. Ana&s;ta&s;e,</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who granted a Charter for that u&s;eful Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This Place gives Title of Earl to the Lord Vi&s;|count <HI>Villiers,</HI> the &s;econd who has enjoy'd that Dignity.</P>
<P N="2">II. The next I&s;le I am to &s;peak of is GUERNSEY, the antient Name of which was <HI>Sarnia.</HI> From <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> it is di&s;tant 20 Miles to the North-we&s;t; yet equals not the former, either in point of Fruitfulne&s;s, or Extent of Territory; for it has but 10 Pari&s;hes. This Advantage however it enjoys above <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> That here no venomous Creatures can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. It is al&s;o naturally better fortify'd from Inva&s;ion, by craggy Rocks and Precipices. On the contrary, its Situa|tion, compar'd with that of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> renders this in|ferior; for whereas the North of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> is much higher than the South, as we have &s;aid, the South Side of <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> is high, and the North low; which produces a double Obliquity of the Sun and Land; and hence the Difference in the Soil and Air of each.
<PB N="267" REF="276">
Notwith&s;tanding this they both agree as to their Ori|ginal, their Productions, and the Civil, Military and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government. Among the circum|jacent Rocks is found the &s;harp and hard Stone call'd <HI>Smyris,</HI> or <HI>Emeril,</HI> and u&s;ed by Glaziers for cutting Gla&s;s, as well as by Jewellers for poli&s;hing their Work.</P>
<P>In Trade it is &s;uperior to its Neighbour <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> by having a more convenient Port at its Ea&s;tern Ex|tremity, adjoining to the South; where the Shore retiring inward in the Form of a Cre&s;cent, makes the Place capable of holding large Ve&s;&s;els. The Foundation of its Pier was laid in the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> I.'s Reign by prodigious Stones, heap'd on each other to a con&s;iderable Height, and regularly cemented. The Shipping here is not only &s;afe, and may be brought clo&s;e up to the Town, which we &s;hall pre&s;ently mention; but the Pier it&s;elf is adorn'd with large &s;mooth Flags, and guarded by Parapets; &s;o that being of &s;ufficient Length and Breadth, it is u&s;ed as the chief Place for Rendezvou&s;es on Parties of Plea&s;ure by the fa&s;hionable People of the Town, as well as for its noble Pro&s;pect over the Sea, and adjacent I&s;les.</P>
<P>On the Right-&s;ide of the Port &s;tands <HI>Cornet-Ca&s;tle,</HI> which at high Tides is &s;urrounded by the Sea. Sir <HI>Leonard Chamberlan,</HI> who was Governor of <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> in <HI>Mary</HI> I.'s Time, and his Succe&s;&s;or, Sir <HI>Thomas Leighton,</HI> improved it with Fortifica|tions. In the Year 1672, the Governor Lord Vi&s;|count <HI>Hatton</HI> lo&s;t his Lady, and him&s;elf e&s;caped with great Difficulty, from a prodigious Storm of Lightning, which, catching the Powder-&s;tore, blew up the lofty Tower with the Standard; &s;o that the Ca&s;tle mu&s;t have formerly made a much more grand Appearance than at pre&s;ent. However, what it wants in Beauty, it makes up in real U&s;efulne&s;s; for it has the Command of the Town and Harbour;
<PB N="268" REF="277">
and its Situation alone renders it &s;trong, being di|vided from the Land by an Arm of the Sea about 600 Yards wide, except in great Spring-tides, when it is fordable.</P>
<P>On the Left-&s;ide too is a mean old Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The only Town is call'd <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s, has a free Trade, (which is however render'd ineffectual by Privateering) has a Market, is well &s;tor'd with Im|plements of War, and con&s;i&s;ts of one long Street, which is narrow, being confin'd between the Sea and the impending Hills. The Market is always plen|tifully &s;upply'd with Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>To the North, joins a Penin&s;ula nam'd <HI>Le Val,</HI> where once was a Priory. And</P>
<P>To the We&s;t, near the Sea, is a Lake, a Mile and a half in Circumference, &s;tock'd with Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially a kind of Carp of extraordinary Size, and delicious to the Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> was (when I was on the Spot) the late Marquis of <HI>Montandre</HI>; and his Lieutenant, <HI>John Graham,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P>From hence the Second Son of <HI>Heneage,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and Lord High Chancellor, by Name <HI>Heneage Finch,</HI> was promoted to the Dig|nity of a Peer of <HI>England,</HI> by the Style of Baron of <HI>Guern&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> there are Eight Mini&s;ters to its Ten Pari&s;hes, Four of them being united.</P>
<P>I cannot take Leave of this I&s;land without a &s;hort Recital of a <HI>flagrant</HI> In&s;tance of Popi&s;h Inhumanity, which, not content to roll in Seas of Blood, all over <HI>England,</HI> extended it&s;elf to this remote Corner. The Fact was thus: In the Days of that Firebrand of her Country, <HI>Mary</HI> I. a poor Widow, and her Two Daughters, one the Wife of <HI>Perrotine Ma&s;|&s;ey,</HI> a Mini&s;ter, who had happily e&s;caped the im|pending Fate by leaving his native Soil, were &s;en|tenced to the Stake for what was call'd <HI>Here&s;y.</HI> The
<PB N="269" REF="278">
marry'd Woman's Body, during the Execution, bur&s;ting, by the Violence of the Flames, di&s;charg'd the Pledge of her conjugal Affection, a beautiful Male Infant, which was ha&s;tily caught up by the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and carried before the Magi|&s;trates, who&s;e <HI>tender Mercies</HI> commanded, That it &s;hould be thrown in with the Mother, which was accordingly done. <HI>Hoc fera religio potuit &s;uadere malorum&punc;</HI> How far the Practices of this Sect may have been changed by the Illumination of <HI>Truth,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Faggots,</HI> notwith&s;tanding their ob&s;tinate Per|&s;everance in their former <HI>Principles,</HI> I will not pre|tend to determine: but &s;ure I am, That from bad <HI>Principles</HI> to bad <HI>Practices</HI> the Tran&s;ition is ex|tremely ea&s;y; and Experience has more than once, e&s;pecially within the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, te&s;tify'd the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation. I now proceed to mention (tho' very briefly) an I&s;le dependent on the Government of <HI>Guern&s;ey.</HI> This is,</P>
<P N="3">III. ALDERNEY, &s;uppo&s;ed by <HI>Camden,</HI> to be the <HI>Arica</HI> of <HI>Antoninus</HI>; by others the <HI>Ebodia</HI> or <HI>Evo|dia</HI> of <HI>P. Diaconus.</HI> It is &s;ituated about a League and a half from <HI>Cape la Hogue</HI> in <HI>Normandy</HI>; is in Circumference about Eight Miles; and contains One Church with a Town, in which are about 200 Hou&s;es, which lodge to the Number of 1000 Inha|bitants. The Soil is good for Pa&s;ture or Arable. And I was &s;hewn one Field here of about 500 Acres, which, as I was told, had not once lain fallow for 100 Years before. Their Manure is Sea-weed, call'd <HI>Vraic,</HI> of which we have taken notice above. The Land lies high; and to the South is a Harbour, admitting only &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The Streight which divides this I&s;le from <HI>France,</HI> term'd <HI>Le Ras de Blanchart,</HI> or <HI>The Race of Alder|ney,</HI> is e&s;teem'd a dangerous Pa&s;&s;age in &s;tormy Wea|ther, when the Winds happen to encounter with
<PB N="270" REF="279">
the &s;trong Currents. In calm Sea&s;ons it is very &s;afe, and the large&s;t Ships may ride here with Ea&s;e. Nay, in 1692-3, Part of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet e&s;cap'd this Way, after the Blow they had met with at <HI>la Hogue.</HI> The la&s;t Place I &s;hall mention in this Letter, is the I&s;le of,</P>
<P N="4">IV. SARKE, which, as well as <HI>Alderney,</HI> is depen|dent on the Government of <HI>Guern&s;ey.</HI> It is no more than Two Miles in Length, and is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of all the others, and guarded with &s;teep Rocks. Its Corn is excellent, the Land very high, which, together with its Situation, renders it one of the &s;tronge&s;t Places in the World. Its Water is very good. Formerly here was no Way for Draughts and Carriages from the Sea, till <HI>Philip de Carteret, Seigneur ae St. O&uacute;en,</HI> (who had a Grant of the I&s;land from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and in who&s;e De&s;cen|dants the Property is ve&s;ted) cau&s;ed one to be cut thro' the impending Cliff, which for &s;ome Space is carry'd on in &s;ubterranean Darkne&s;s, till it emerges within the I&s;land, and is fortify'd with Cannon, and by a Gate. In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. was &s;tanding the Convent of <HI>St. Magloire,</HI> with a Pen|&s;ion from the Exchequer, where that holy Per&s;on is &s;aid to have re&s;ided.</P>
<P>The I&s;land fell into the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> but in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. was recover'd; and the Inhabitants have ever &s;ince enjoy'd the mild Influence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, equally ap|proving of their pre&s;ent happy Condition, and dete&s;t|ing the Fetters of <HI>French</HI> Slavery. Their Number amounts to about 300; and one Mini&s;ter performs their divine Offices. Thus, having completed what I promi&s;ed, I re&s;t from my TOUR, and am,</P>

<P>We &s;hall begin with a brief De&s;cription of the famous Gardens of the Right Hon. the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Cobham,</HI> at <HI>Stow</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VOL. II. p. 105.</HEAD>
<P>WE enter'd on the South-&s;ide of the Garden, between Two &s;quare Pavilions of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, the Work of Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI>; and were &s;truck with the &s;urpri&s;ing Grandeur and Variety of the Objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to our View, of which I &s;hall give a brief Account in Order, as we pa&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, in the Middle of a large Octagon Piece of Water, &s;tands an Obeli&s;k of near 70 Feet,
<PB N="272" REF="281">
which is de&s;ign'd for a <HI>Jet-d' Eau</HI> to ca&s;cade from the Top of it. At a good Di&s;tance we beheld Two beautiful Rivers, which join, and enter the Octa|gon in One Stream. Over One of the Rivers is a <HI>Palladian</HI> Bridge, which is an agreeable Object. A <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, 70 Feet high, pre&s;ents it&s;elf on the Summit of a fine Hill; which, we were told, is intended to be dedicated to <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Here we had likewi&s;e a View of the South Front of the Hou&s;e, up an Avenue of &s;tately Trees; but great Objections have been made to the Narrow|ne&s;s of it, which is, no doubt, an e&s;&s;ential Fault. However, &s;ince every Tree may be deem'd a &s;ort of Obeli&s;k to the Honour of the noble Planter, it makes a good Excu&s;e for their &s;tanding; and the rather, as, if they were taken away, it would create an Evil, which could not be remedied in 40 Years.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Gothick</HI> Building is on the Right-hand, &s;o on the Le&s;t appears an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Pyramid, dedicated to the Memory of Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, here is &s;uch a Scene of Magnificence and Nature di&s;play'd, the Fields abounding with Cattle, the Trees and Water &s;o delightfully inter|mingled, and &s;uch a charming Verdure, Symmetry, and Proportion, every-where pre&s;enting to the Eye, that the Judgment is agreeably puzzled, which &s;ingly to prefer of &s;o many collected Beauties.</P>
<P>Leaving this Point, and on the Left-hand pa&s;&s;ing by Three Statues, we came to the Cold-bath, from whence we beheld a natural Ca&s;cade falling down from the before-mentioned Octagon, in Three dif|ferent Sheets of Water, into a large Lake. One of the Sheets glides thro' an Arch, or Piece of Ruin, which is mo&s;tly hid by a Clump of Ever-greens; but his Lord&s;hip, as we are told, de&s;igns to make a good deal of Amendment to it, tho' at pre&s;ent it has a very natural and agreeable Appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="282">From hence we proceeded to the Hermitage, which is agreeably &s;ituated in a ri&s;ing Wood, and by the Side of the Lake; and pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Wood, we came to the Statues of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> fronting the <HI>Veneris Hortus,</HI> a very neat Structure, de&s;igned by Mr. <HI>Kent,</HI> the In&s;ide of it painted by Mr. <HI>Sleats</HI>; and on the Frize is the following Motto, alluding to the Painting in the Cave:
<Q><L>Nunc amet, qui nondum amavit;</L>
<L>Quique amavit, nunc amet.</L></Q> Which is,
<Q><L>He who ne'er lov'd, a Lover grow;</L>
<L>And he who has &mdash; continue &s;o.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here is likewi&s;e a <HI>Sophia.</HI> Each Way, from the En|trance of the Room, is a hand&s;ome Colonnade, lead|ing to &s;quare Tabernacles or Pavilions. Here are al&s;o Four venerable antique Bu&s;toes, of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Nero, Cleopatra,</HI> and <HI>Fau&s;tina.</HI></P>
<P>Hence to the Head of the Lake we had a plea&s;ant View of the Ca&s;cade; and from hence to <HI>Gibbs</HI>'s Building, or the <HI>Belvidere,</HI> which is placed on the Top of the Mount, is a noble Pro&s;pect of the Hou&s;e, the Church, the Effigies of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, and the late Queen; the Rotonda; the Ca&s;tle, which a Farmer now inhabits, and was built for that Purpo&s;e; but on account of its being &s;eated on the Side of a fine ri&s;ing Hill, makes a beautiful Appear|ance as well from hence, as from many other Places.</P>
<P>In the Garden is likewi&s;e the Temple of <HI>Friend|&s;hip,</HI> from which the Pavilion at the Entrance, the Ca&s;cade, the Lake, one of the Fields that is in|clo&s;ed in the Garden, all together afford a Scene truly charming.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Boycoat</HI> Buildings, pa&s;&s;ing thro' a plea&s;ant Wood with &s;everal agreeable Pro&s;pects into the Country, we &s;aw on our Right-hand a noble
<PB N="274" REF="283">
Terrace. One of the Buildings is a very good ha|bitable Hou&s;e; the other &s;tands on a &s;quare Bottom in the Garden; and in the In&s;ide of it are Four Sta|tues, at full Length, in Niches; viz. <HI>Cicero, Fau|&s;tina, Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Livia.</HI> The Buildings are both fini&s;h'd with pyramidical Tops, by <HI>Gibbs.</HI> Betwixt them is a very hand&s;ome Gate-way, which is the &s;econd Entrance to the Hou&s;e, from which leads up a noble Avenue, planted with double Lines of thriving Trees.</P>
<P>From hence to the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Pyramid mentioned before, which is 60 Feet high, and about half Way up, is this In&s;cription in very large Characters:
<Q>Inter plurima hortorum horum aedificia a JO|HANNE VANBRUGH, equite, de&s;ignata, hanc pyramidem illius memoriae &s;acram e&s;&s;e voluit COBHAM.</Q> In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thus:
<Q>Among a very great Number of Structures in the&s;e Gardens, de&s;igned by Sir JOHN VAN|BRUGH, Knight, COBHAM thought fit, that this Pyramid &s;hould be &s;acred to his Memory.</Q></P>
<P>And in the In&s;ide of the Building is the following In&s;cription:
<Q><L>Lu&s;i&s;ti &s;atis, edi&s;ti &s;atis, atque bibi&s;ti:</L>
<L>Tempus abire tibi e&s;t; ne potum largius aequo</L>
<L>Rideat &amp; pul&s;et la&s;civa decentius aetas.</L></Q> Which may be thus tran&s;lated:
<Q><L>Enough you've &s;ported, quaff'd the Bowl, and eat:</L>
<L>'Tis Time that from the Banquet you retreat;</L>
<L>Le&s;t Youth, more fitly frolick&s;ome, may join</L>
<L>To pu&s;h you, reeling under Loads of Wine.</L></Q></P>
<P>From hence going along a &s;ort of Fortification Walk on our Left-hand, the Wood on the other
<PB N="275" REF="284">
Hand, we enter'd the Field, which is inclo&s;ed in a military Way, with a &s;taked Fence. At the fir&s;t Angle, on the middle of the Gravel-walk, are the Statues of <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Ant&euml;us.</HI> Hence we proceeded to <HI>St. Augu&s;tine</HI>'s Cave, which is a Building of Roots of Trees and Mo&s;s; and in it a Straw Couch with Three In&s;criptions in <HI>Monki&s;h Latin</HI> Ver&s;e. It is placed in a natural Wood, and from the Oddne&s;s of the Fabrick, and the agreeable Simplicity which is round it, makes a very entertaining Variety.</P>
<P>Leaving this Place, we approached a Building of a very different Nature &mdash; the Temple of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> built of Brick, with Paintings in the In&s;ide alluding to the Name. Here we had a fine di&s;tant Pro&s;pect toward <HI>Ayle&s;bury</HI> and <HI>Wendover</HI> Hills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Garden we had in full View the Temple of <HI>Venus:</HI> and between the Two is an Obeli&s;k erected to the Memory of a Clergyman, with this In&s;cription:
<Q><HI>To the Memory of</HI> ROBIN COUCHER.</Q></P>
<P>We proceeded from hence to the <HI>Saxon</HI> Temple, which is a &s;olemn Grove with the Seven <HI>Saxon</HI> Dei|ties pre&s;iding over the &s;everal Days of the Week, placed in Niches; and in the Middle of them &s;tands an Altar, as for Sacrifice. All the Statues are ex|tremely good, and this Scene agreeably &s;trikes the Mind with Serenity and Compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our Eye, after being confined in the Wood, breaking at once out of it, we were &s;urpri&s;ed with a fine open Country on the North: on the South, the Rotonda appears: on the We&s;t, the <HI>Boycoat</HI> Buildings: on the Ea&s;t, the Eque&s;trian Statue of the late King, which &s;tands in the Front of the Hou&s;e. The&s;e Objects pre&s;ent them&s;elves from <HI>Nel&s;on's</HI> Seat, which is an oblong &s;quare Rece&s;s in a Clump of Ever-greens. To the South-ea&s;t is a View of the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, which is an extraordinary good one; but, his Lord&s;hip annually adding to and im|proving
<PB N="276" REF="285">
it, one may &s;afely &s;ay, that it will not be much inferior to the be&s;t Hou&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> if his Lord&s;hip's De&s;ign be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Offices on the North-&s;ide are all inclo&s;ed within a mo&s;t elegant Wall, with Niches, and grand Gate-ways into the Offices and Gardens. The Hou&s;e and Offices, when perfected, will be about 640 Feet in Length, fronting North and South. As <HI>Nel&s;on</HI>'s Seat lies to the North-we&s;t from the Portico of the Hou&s;e, there is on the North-ea&s;t a new Ba&s;tion building to an&s;wer it; and &s;ome grand Walks are now making by the Side of a fine Lawn, from which we &s;ee numerous Herds of Deer. A Semicircle of fine Timber appears at &s;ome Miles Di&s;tance with an agreeable Country between.</P>
<P>On the South Front of the Hou&s;e is a very hand|&s;ome Parterre, decorated with <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Mu&s;es, gilt Ve&s;&s;els, and Two Orangeries: but it is likely this will be intirely altered; for if the lower End is laid open, there will appear a noble Scene, where Nature and Art are curiou&s;ly blended.</P>
<P>The next Object of our View was a <HI>Corinthian</HI> Column, on which is the Statue of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, with this In&s;cription:
<Q>GEORGIO AVGVSTO.</Q></P>
<P>Here we had a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect over the Country; and in the Garden &s;everal of the Build|ings pre&s;ent them&s;elves with great Pomp. The Lake, who&s;e Bounds are beautifully concealed, adds much to the general Agreeablene&s;s of the Place.</P>
<P><HI>Dido</HI>'s Cave was the next Subject of our Atten|tion: this is a Stone Building, in a Wood, and rai&s;ed on a &s;ort of Amphitheatre, with this In&s;cription:
<Q><L>Speluncam <HI>Dido,</HI> dux &amp; <HI>Trojanus,</HI> eandem</L>
<L>Deveniunt &mdash;.</L></Q> <PB N="277" REF="286">In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thus:
<Q><L>Repairing to the &s;ame dark Cave are &s;een,</L>
<L>The <HI>Trojan</HI> Hero, and the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Queen.</L></Q></P>
<P>From hence we advanced to the Rotonda, which is a neat airy Building by Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh.</HI> The Dome of it &s;upported on Ten <HI>Dorick</HI> Columns; and in the Centre, &s;tanding on a circular Pede&s;tal, a <HI>Venus &agrave; Medicis.</HI> From this Place we had a View of Part of the Octagon; the Lake, the Fields, and &s;everal of the Buildings, pre&s;enting them&s;elves alter|nately as we turned our&s;elves round.</P>
<P>As we went from hence to the late Queen's Sta|tue, by the Side of a Canal, we were delighted with an Alteration of his Lord&s;hip's; <HI>viz.</HI> On each Side the Ground is broken, and planted with Clumps of various kinds of Trees, intermixt with Statues, which are promi&s;cuou&s;ly placed. Her late Ma|je&s;ty's Effigies is erected on Four <HI>Ionick</HI> Columns, which are placed on a large Pede&s;tal, with this In|&s;cription in Golden Letters:
<Q>Honori, Laudi, Virtuti Divae CAROLINAE.</Q>
<Q>To the Honour, Prai&s;e, and Virtue of the Di|vine CAROLINE.</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;ituated on a neat Amphitheatre of Slopes, with pa&s;toral Figures each Way from it. Nature and Art here, joining together, make an agreeable Contra&s;te.</P>
<P>Next we were led into the Sleeping Parlour, which is a &s;quare Building placed in a Wood with Six Walks centring in it. Within, are painted the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> Heads, with &s;everal Fe&s;tons of Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> On the Frize is this In&s;cription:
<Q>Cum omnia &s;int in incerto, &s;ave tibi.</Q> Which is,
<Q>Since all Things are uncertain, indulge thy&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287">Leaving this Place, and cro&s;&s;ing the Avenue be|fore-mentioned, from the Pavilions we came to the Witch-hou&s;e, a &s;quare Building, the In&s;ide of which is painted by my Lord's Gentleman, with &s;everal Devices alluding to the Name.</P>
<P>We arrived next at the Temple of <HI>Antient Virtue,</HI> a Rotonda of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, by Mr. <HI>Kent:</HI> and in Four Niches, &s;tanding at full Lengths, are the Four following Statues; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. EPAMINONDAS, with this In&s;cription over his Head:
<Q>Cujus a virtute, prudentia, verecundia,<LB>Thebanorum re&s;publica<LB>Libertatem &s;imul &amp; imperium,<LB>Di&s;ciplinam bellicam, civilem &amp; dome&s;ticam,<LB>Accepit;<LB>Eoque ami&s;&s;o, perdidit.</Q> That is,
<Q>From who&s;e Valour, Prudence, and Moderation, the Republick of <HI>Thebes</HI> received both Liberty and Empire, its military, civil, and dome&s;tick Di&s;cipline; and, with him, lo&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. LYCURGUS, with this:
<Q>Qui &s;ummo cum con&s;ilio inventis legibus,<LB>Omnemque contra corruptelam munitis optime,<LB>Pater patriae,<LB>Libertatem firmi&s;&s;imam,<LB>Et mores &s;ancti&s;&s;imos,<LB>Expul&s;a cum divitiis avaritia, luxuria, libidine,<LB>In multa &s;ecula<LB>Civibus &s;uis in&s;tituit.</Q> Thus tran&s;lated:
<Q>Who having invented Laws with the greate&s;t Wi&s;|dom, and mo&s;t excellently fenced them again&s;t all Corruption, as a Father of his Country, in&s;tituted for his Countrymen the firme&s;t Liber|ty, and the &s;ounde&s;t Morality, which endured
<PB N="279" REF="288">
for many Ages, he having, together with Riches, bani&s;hed Avarice, Luxury, and Lu&s;t.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. SOCRATES,
<Q>Qui corrupti&s;&s;ima in civitate innocens,<LB>Bonorum hortator, unici cultor DEI,<LB>Ab inutili otio, &amp; vanis di&s;putationibus,<LB>Ad officia vitae, &amp; &s;ocietatis commoda,<LB>Philo&s;ophiam avocavit,<LB>Hominum &s;apienti&s;&s;imus.</Q> That is,
<Q>Who being innocent in a mo&s;t corrupt State, an Encourager of the Good, a Wor&s;hipper of One only GOD, as the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, reduced Philo&s;ophy from u&s;ele&s;s Indolence, and vain Di&s;putations, to the Duties of Life, and the Advantages of Society.</Q></P>
<P N="4">IV. HOMERUS,
<Q>Qui poetarum princeps, idem &amp; maximus,<LB>Virtutis praeco, &amp; immortalitatis largitor,<LB>Divino carmine,<LB>Ad pulcre audendum, &amp; patiendum fortiter,<LB>Omnibus notus gentibus, omnes incitat.</Q> Thus rendered:
<Q>Who being the Fir&s;t of Poets, as he was the greate&s;t, the Herald of Virtue, and Be&s;tower of Immortality, known to all Nations, incites all, in a Divine Poem, honourably to dare, and re&s;olutely to &s;uffer.</Q></P>
<P>Over one Door is this In&s;cription:
<Q>Charum e&s;&s;e civem, bene de republica mereri, laudari, coli, diligi, glorio&s;um e&s;t: metui vero, &amp; in odio e&s;&s;e, invidio&s;um, dete&s;tabile, imbecil|lum, caducum.</Q> Which is:
<Q>To be dear to our Country, to de&s;erve well of the State, to be prai&s;ed, honoured, and beloved,
<PB N="280" REF="289">
is glorious: but to be dreaded, and hated, is matter of Ill-will, dete&s;table, weak, ruinous.</Q></P>
<P>Over the other Door this:
<Q>Ju&s;titiam cole &amp; pietatem, quae cum &s;it magna in parentibus &amp; propinquis, tum in patria maxima e&s;t. Ea vita via e&s;t in coelum, &amp; in hunc coetum eorum, qui jam vixerunt.</Q> In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thus:
<Q>Maintain Ju&s;tice, and thy relative Duty; which, as it is great, when exerci&s;ed toward our Parents and Kindred, &s;o is greate&s;t toward our Country. That Life is the Way to Heaven, and to this A&s;&s;embly of tho&s;e, who have al|ready lived.</Q></P>
<P>From this Place we had no di&s;tant Pro&s;pect, but, notwith&s;tanding that, it abounds with la&s;ting Beauties: it is really placed in a &s;ort of Paradi&s;e; and, Things ri&s;ing adequate to that Name, you &s;ee <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> flouri&s;hing in immortal Youth; in the <HI>Ely&s;ian Fields</HI> are many great and virtuous Mens Names perpe|tuated, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in <HI>this</HI> World by an&s;wering the End of their Creation. Near this Place al&s;o is a good Emblem of tho&s;e who have deviated from it, in the Ruin. Here are &s;weet purl|ing Streams, re&s;embling the melodious Sounds of Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We were now not far from the Pari&s;h Church, which is &s;o clo&s;ely &s;urrounded with a Wood, as not to be &s;een. From hence we came to the Side of a River, where
<Q><L>Unpoli&s;h'd Nature cannot boa&s;t a Part;</L>
<L>For Chance too regular, too rude for Art.</L></Q></P>
<P>And by its winding Banks we were led up to a Grotto, which is to be decorated with Shells, Peb|bles, and Minerals. Here is likewi&s;e a Shell-pavilion,
<PB N="281" REF="290">
the Dome of which is &s;upported by Six wreathed Columns. The In&s;ide of it hath &s;everal Marks per|formed from Shells, and divers other Imbelli&s;hments. On the oppo&s;ite Side is to be another of Pebbles.</P>
<P>Hence we proceeded to the Three-arch'd Building, which is a plea&s;ant Rece&s;s, by the Banks of the River; and in pa&s;&s;ing we &s;aw <HI>Antient Virtue</HI> peeping on the South-&s;ide of us. The Church we had in full View on the We&s;t. To the Ea&s;t is &s;ituated the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hou&s;e, a Building in the Pond, the Out-&s;ide of it painted very ingeniou&s;ly, in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Ta&s;te, by the celebrated Mr. <HI>Sleats.</HI> The In&s;ide of it is <HI>Indian</HI> Japan.</P>
<P>The Shell Bridge led us from hence into the <HI>Ely&s;ian Fields,</HI> the mo&s;t charming Place that ever Eyes beheld. It may not be improper here to give the fol|lowing Lines, which were left by an unknown Gen|tleman, on his Entrance into them:
<Q><LG>

<P>We are now come to the Monuments of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Worthies; the Fir&s;t of which is Mr. POPE, with no In&s;cription.</P>
<P>The next is Sir THOMAS GRESHAM, with this In&s;cription:

<P>Sir FRANCIS BACON, Lord VERULAM,

<P>Signor FIDO,
<Q>An <HI>Italian</HI> of good Extraction, who came into <HI>England,</HI> not to bite us, like mo&s;t of his Countrymen, but to gain an honourable Live|lihood: he hunted not after Fame; yet ac|quired it: regardle&s;s of the Prai&s;e of his Friends, but mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of their Love. Tho' he lived among&s;t the Great, he neither learnt nor flat|tered any Vice. He was no Bigot, nor doubted he of any of the XXXIX. Articles: and if to follow Nature, and re&s;pect the Laws of So|ciety, be Philo&s;ophy, he was a perfect Philo|&s;opher; a faithful Friend, and an agreeable Com|panion, a loving Hu&s;band, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by a numerous Off-&s;pring, all which he lived to &s;ee take good Cour&s;es; and in his Old-age re|tired

<P>Cro&s;&s;ing the Field to the <HI>Gothick</HI> Building before de&s;cribed, we had a boundle&s;s Pro&s;pect round the Building. From hence we de&s;cended a fine Hill; and on our Left-hand &s;aw a Plantation of Ever|greens; on our Right the Well de&s;igned, and Rivers de&s;cribed from the Pavilion. This Walk led us down to a very hand&s;ome Bridge over one of the Rivers.

<P>In&s;tead of what is there &s;aid, of the Earl of <HI>Burlington</HI>'s Seat at <HI>Chi&s;wick,</HI> in&s;ert the following.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over &s;o &s;lightly the noble Seat of the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Bur|lington</HI>; which was a plain, u&s;eful Hou&s;e, with a Number of good Offices about it: but as a Part of the old Hou&s;e was de&s;troyed &s;ome Years ago, by Fire, his Lord&s;hip erected a mo&s;t beautiful Villa, near to
<PB N="288" REF="297">
the old Hou&s;e; which for Elegance of Ta&s;te &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es every thing of its kind in <HI>England,</HI> if not in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Court in Front of the Hou&s;e is of a proportionable Size to the Building, which is gra|velled, and kept always very neat. On each Side are Yew Hedges, in Panels, with <HI>Termini,</HI> placed at proper Di&s;tance; in Front of which are planted two Rows of Cedars of <HI>Libanus,</HI> which at pre&s;ent have a fine Effect to the Eye, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e; for the dark Shade of the&s;e &s;olemn ever-green Trees occa&s;ions a fine Contra&s;te with the elegant white Building which appears between them.</P>
<P>The A&s;cent to the Hou&s;e is by a noble Flight of Stone Steps, on one Side of which is the Statue of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> and on the other that of <HI>Palladio.</HI> The Portico is &s;upported by fine fluted Pillars of the <HI>Corin|thian</HI> Order, and the Cornice, Frize, and Archi|trave are as rich as po&s;&s;ible; &s;o that the Front of this Building &s;trikes every Per&s;on (tho' not a nice Judge of Architecture) with uncommon Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The other Front towards the Garden is plainer, but yet is very bold and grand, having a plea&s;ing Simpli|city, as hath al&s;o the Side-Front, toward the <HI>Serpen|tine River,</HI> which is different from the other Two.</P>
<P>The In&s;ide of the Hou&s;e is fini&s;hed in the highe&s;t Ta&s;te, the Ceilings being richly gilt and painted; and the Rooms are filled with &s;ome of the be&s;t Pictures in <HI>Europe</HI>; and tho' the Hou&s;e is &s;mall, yet it would take up more Room than can be al|lowed here, to de&s;cribe the particular Beauties of it.</P>
<P>The Gardens are al&s;o laid out in an elegant Ta&s;te. When you de&s;cend from the Hou&s;e, you enter on a Lawn of Gra&s;s, planted with Clumps of ever-green Trees, between which are two Rows of large Stone Va&s;es. At the Ends next the Hou&s;e are two fine Wolves in Stone, cut by Mr. <HI>Sceidmaker</HI> the famous Statuary: and at the farther End are two large Lions; and to terminate this View are three
<PB N="289" REF="298">
fine antique Statues, which were dug up in <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Garden at <HI>Rome,</HI> with Stone Seats between each; and on the Back of the Statues is a clo&s;e Plantation of Ever-greens, which terminates the Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>On the Right-hand, as you go from the Hou&s;e, you look thro' an open Grove of Fore&s;t-trees, to the Orangery; which is &s;eparated from the Lawn by a Fau&s;&s;ee, to &s;ecure the Orange-trees from being in|jured by Per&s;ons who are admitted to walk in the Garden; &s;o that they are &s;een as perfectly, and when the Orange-trees are in Flower, the Scent is diffu&s;ed over the whole Lawn to the Hou&s;e, as if the Trees were placed on the Lawn.</P>
<P>On the Left-hand you have an ea&s;y Slope of Gra&s;s down to the Serpentine River, on the Side of which are Clumps of Ever-greens, which make agreeable Breaks to the Eye, between which the Water is &s;een; and at the farther End is a Peep into an Inclo&s;ure, where are an Obeli&s;k and a <HI>Roman</HI> Temple, with Gra&s;s Slopes, and a circular Piece of Water in the Middle.</P>
<P>From this Lawn you are led to the Wilderne&s;s, through which are three &s;trait Avenues, termi|nated by three different Buildings; and within the Quarters are Serpentine Walks, thro' which you may walk near a Mile in con&s;tant Shade.</P>
<P>On each Side the Serpentine River is a Gra&s;s Walk, which follow the Turns of the River; and on the Right-hand of the River is a Building, which is the exact Model of the Portico of <HI>Covent Garden</HI> Church; and on the Left is a Wilderne&s;s, which is laid out in regular Walks, with clipp'd Hedges on each Side, which is too mean for the other Parts of the Garden; and it is much to be wondered his Lord&s;hip &s;hould &s;uffer them to remain in the pre&s;ent Form.</P>
<P>Over the River, in the middle Part, is a <HI>Palladian</HI> Bridge of Wood, which his Lord&s;hip cro&s;&s;es in his
<PB N="290" REF="299">
Coach to come round to the Hou&s;e; for there is a Coach Road thro' the Garden, by which his Lord|&s;hip pa&s;&s;es when he comes from <HI>London,</HI> &s;o that the Earl &s;eldom goes thro' the Town of <HI>Chi&s;wick</HI> to his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the End of the River, next the Road, is a fine Ca&s;cade lately erected, which by an Engine to rai&s;e the Water, his Lord&s;hip propo&s;ed to have a con&s;tant Fall into the River; but the Engine failing, it is but &s;eldom the Ca&s;cade can play, and then but for a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Next the Road his Lord&s;hip has rai&s;ed a Terrace, (with the Earth which came out of the River) from whence you have a Pro&s;pect of the adjacent Coun|try; and when the Tide is up, you &s;ee the Water of the <HI>Thames,</HI> with the Boats and Barges pa&s;&s;ing, which greatly enlivens the Pro&s;pect. In a Word, there is more Variety in this Garden, than can be found in any other of the &s;ame Size in <HI>England,</HI> or perhaps in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

</HEADNOTE>
<P>IT is &s;ituated near <HI>Ealing,</HI> between the two great We&s;tern Roads, and &s;tands on an Eminence, the Ground falling gradually from it to the <HI>Brentford</HI> Road; &s;o that from the Portico in the Back-front of the Hou&s;e, you have an exceeding fine Pro&s;pect of the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and all the Meadows on the Borders for &s;ome Miles, as al&s;o a good Pro&s;pect of <HI>London,</HI> in clear Weather. This Hou&s;e was built by Mr. <HI>Web,</HI> who was Son-in-law to the famous <HI>Inigo Jones</HI>; and indeed the Archi|tecture &s;hews it was contrived by him, or at lea&s;t by a Scholar of his; for altho' the Building is as plain on the Out&s;ide as po&s;&s;ible, yet there is a &s;imple
<PB N="291" REF="300">
Boldne&s;s in it, which graces all the Buildings of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> rarely to be found in the Works of other Architects. The Apartments in the Hou&s;e are extremely convenient, and well contrived. The Hall is very large, having Rows of Columns on each Side. From thence you a&s;cend by a noble Flight of Stairs, to a Salon, which is a double Cube of Twenty|five Feet. This Room the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or <HI>Henry Furne&s;s,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is fitting up in a mo&s;t elegant Ta&s;te, and he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine Collection of capital Pictures: &s;o he propo&s;es to hang this Room intirely with them; which, when fini&s;hed, will render it one of the fine&s;t Rooms in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>From this Room is the Entrance to the Portico on the Back-front of the Hou&s;e, which is &s;upported by Columns, and is a delightful Place to &s;it in, in the Afternoon, during the Summer Sea&s;on; for as it faces the South-ea&s;t, &s;o the Sun is gone from it by two o' the Clock, and &s;hining on the Country, which is open to the View, renders the Pro&s;pect very de|lightful.</P>
<P>Upon going out of the Hou&s;e into the Garden, you come upon a noble Terrace, the whole Width of the Garden, from whence you have a fine Pro|&s;pect of the neighbouring Country, and on which you may walk dry after the greate&s;t Rains; from this Terrace you de&s;cend to the Garden by a noble Flight of Stone Steps, the upper Part of which is concave, and the lower convex, with a noble Stone Balu&s;trade on each Side, as al&s;o upon the Coping of the Wall, the Length of the Hou&s;e, which makes a fine Ap|pearance from the Road; but the Gardens are laid out too plain, having the Walls in View on every Side; and at pre&s;ent the Offices are too mean for the Hou&s;e, which I hear the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in|tends to alter, in a mo&s;t elegant Ta&s;te, which will render it the fine&s;t Seat near <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>AT <HI>Peckham</HI> is the Seat of the late Lord <HI>Trevor,</HI> which was built in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. by Sir <HI>Thomas Bond,</HI> who was deeply engaged with that unfortunate Prince in his Schemes, and was obliged to quit the Kingdom with him; &s;o the Hou&s;e was plundered by the Populace, and became a Forfeit to the Crown. In the Building and the Gardens, large Sums of Money were expended; for the Whole was executed according to the polite&s;t Ta&s;te of tho&s;e Times. The Front of the Hou&s;e &s;tands to the North, having Two Rows of large Elm-trees of a con&s;iderable Length before it, thro' which the Tower of <HI>London</HI> appears as a Termina|tion to the Pro&s;pect; but on each Side of this Avenue you have a View of <HI>London,</HI> from <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Greenwich</HI>; and at high Water the Ma&s;ts of the Ve&s;&s;els on the River of <HI>Thames</HI> appear over the Trees and Hou&s;es like a Wood, which greatly improves the Pro&s;pect. The Fields in Front, and on each Side of the Hou&s;e, being well cultivated, render them very agreeable; and the Town of <HI>Peckham</HI> lies on the Back&s;ide of the Gardens, but is &s;hut out from the View by Plantations. The Wilderne&s;s indeed was planted too regular, having diagonal Walks inter&s;ecting each other, with Hedges on each Side; but this was the Ta&s;te which prevailed, when tho&s;e Gardens were laid out. The Kitchen-garden and the Walls were planted with the choice&s;t Fruit-trees from <HI>France,</HI> and an experienced Fruit-gardener was &s;ent for from <HI>Paris,</HI> to have the Management of them; &s;o that the Collection of Fruits in this Garden has been accounted one of the be&s;t in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>A private Gentleman purcha&s;ed this Seat &s;oon after the Death of the late Lord <HI>Trevor,</HI> and had begun
<PB N="293" REF="302">
to make very great Alterations, particularly in cut|ting down Hedges, removing Walls and Buildings, which intercepted the Pro&s;pect of the neighbouring Fields; and had the Gentleman lived a few Years longer, he would have intirely altered it to the mo|dern Ta&s;te of Gardening, and rendred it a &s;weet Retirement, con&s;idering its Vicinity to <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>IN the Year 1740, on the Promotion of Dr. <HI>Gil|bert,</HI> Dean of this Church, to the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Llandaff,</HI> his Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to confer the Deanry on Dr. <HI>Alured Clarke,</HI> who was in&s;talled in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> in that Year; and if we may be allowed to judge from the pious Acts he began with in that Station, a more worthy Man could not have been preferr'd thereto.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, an antient Building, belonging to that Dignity, had, thro' the Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of its former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, been too long neglected; wherefore his Fir&s;t Work was to &s;et about altering and repairing that, which he did within Nine Months of his In&s;tall|ment, at an Expence of about 800<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Before this was perfected, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Spring 1741, he drew up and publi&s;hed Propo&s;als for founding an Ho&s;pital in this City, for Lodging, Dieting, and Curing the Sick and Lame Poor thereof, and of the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> on the like Plan of that which he had before founded at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> for the Benefit of that City, and County of <HI>Hants.</HI> A De&s;ign &s;o good, recommended by the pious Eloquence of a Divine &s;o learned and judicious, on Views &s;o vi&s;ibly di&s;intere&s;ted, and &s;o clearly ab&s;tracted from all Party Schemes or Intentions, met with the general Ap|plau&s;e and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gentry and Clergy of all Parties, Sects and Denominations; who, however
<PB N="294" REF="303">
different in Religion and Politicks, unanimou&s;ly join'd in this pious Undertaking: and a Sub&s;cription being opened in <HI>March,</HI> hath already (<HI>November</HI> 1741) brought in about 2000<HI>l.</HI> of which near 1500<HI>l.</HI> are annual Engagements, which 'tis highly probable will be not only continued, but much augmented, &s;o that 'tis hoped, that 200 Patients at a time may be provided for. <HI>John Tuckfield,</HI> of <HI>Raddon,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was plea&s;ed to accommodate the Governors with a Plot of Ground near <HI>Southernhay,</HI> without the City-walls, at a very moderate Price, and to give 100<HI>l.</HI> towards carrying on the Building for the intended Ho&s;pital, the Plan of which was commodiou&s;ly de|&s;igned by the Direction of the Dean, and the Fir&s;t Stone thereof laid by him, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exon,</HI> Sir <HI>William Courtenay,</HI> Knight of the Shire, Sir <HI>Henry Northcote,</HI> and <HI>Humphry Sydenham,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Citizens in Parliament, the Honourable <HI>Henry Rolle,</HI> and <HI>John Tuckfield,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> attended by a great Number of Clergy and Gentry, that are Sub&s;cribers, and Thou&s;ands of joyful Spectators, on the 27th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1741.

In digging the Ground for the Founda|tion the Workmen found a <HI>Roman</HI> Coin of <HI>Nerva,</HI> and another of <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI></P>
<P>The Charity-&s;chools founded here by the pious Bi&s;hop <HI>Blackall,</HI> in the Year 1709, the good Dean not only bountifully &s;ub&s;cribed to, but preached a Sermon before a large A&s;&s;embly of Governors and Contributors; and after the Sermon, at a Court held for that Purpo&s;e, in&s;pected the Rules, inquired into the Cau&s;es of Complaint, and prevail'd on the Go|vernors to vi&s;it the Schools oftener, and diligently endeavour to render that Charity as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>AT <HI>Pain&s;hill</HI> near <HI>Cobham</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> is the Seat of the Hon. <HI>Charles Hamilton,</HI> where is a great Improvement making by inclo&s;ing a large Tract of Land de&s;igned for a Park, which was mo&s;t of it &s;o poor as not to produce any thing but <HI>Heath</HI> and <HI>Broom</HI>; but by burning of the <HI>Heath,</HI> and &s;preading of the A&s;hes on the Ground, a Crop of <HI>Turneps</HI> was obtained; and by feeding Sheep on the <HI>Turneps,</HI> their Dung become a good Manure to the Land, &s;o that a good Sward of Gra&s;s is now upon the Land, where it was judged by mo&s;t People impo&s;&s;ible to get any Herbage. This is the &s;ort of Improvement which was mentioned in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where Land has been rai&s;ed from Five Shillings an Acre <HI>per Ann.</HI> to Thirty or Forty Shillings: and were this &s;ort of Hu&s;bandry practi&s;ed in many other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> it would be of great Service to the Publick, and greatly in|crea&s;e the Value of the Lands to the Proprietor.</P>
<P>And this leads me to a Reflection on the pre&s;ent advanced Price of <HI>Butter</HI> and <HI>Chee&s;e,</HI> (<HI>Anno</HI> 1742.) which many People attribute intirely to the Two la&s;t hard Winters, and the &s;ucceeding dry Summers; which mu&s;t be allowed have greatly contributed towards it; yet the&s;e are not the only Cau&s;es of it; but there has of late Years been a great Neglect of the Dairy-farms, either from the Poverty of the Farmers, who could not keep up their Stock of Cows, or by ploughing too much of their Gra&s;s-ground for rai&s;ing of Corn. And many Landlords (it is to be feared) have permitted their Tenants to break up too much of their Land for Corn, becau&s;e of the great Demand there has been for it abroad of late Years; and this has enabled their Tenants to pay their Rent better than otherwi&s;e they could have done.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;equence will be &s;everely felt for &s;ome Years; for as the Farmers Stock of Cattle has been reduced greatly by this Alteration in the Hu&s;bandry,
<PB N="296" REF="305">
&s;o it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to get Manure enough to keep their Land in Heart; and when this fre&s;h Ground is worn out by Crops, the yearly Value of it will be reduced to le&s;s than one Third of what it has produced: &s;o that it is greatly to be feared mo&s;t of the E&s;tates in <HI>England</HI> will be le&s;&s;ened in their Rent; and unle&s;s the Owners will be at &s;ome Expence to lay down properly a Proportion of their Lands for Gra&s;s, they can hardly expect ever to &s;ee a proper Sward on their E&s;tates; for the Farmers in general have not the lea&s;t Skill in this particular Branch of Hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion: The Lands which Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> has inclo&s;ed, have fine Inequali|ties; for every 100 Yards there are great Hollows, then ri&s;ing Grounds again, &s;o that the Pro&s;pect is continually changing, as you walk over it; and (if we may gue&s;s by what this Gentleman has already done) the Whole will be laid out conformable to the natural Situation of the Ground; and when the Plantations, which are already made, are grown up, it will be a delightful Place; and this upon a Spot of Ground, which lay almo&s;t neglected, before this Gentleman became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; &s;o that whatever is here laid cut, will be intirely an Improvement, &s;ince without it the Land would have produced very little Rent to the Proprietor. And would the Gentle|men who inclo&s;e large Tracts of Land into Parks, follow this Gentleman's Method, of inclo&s;ing &s;uch Land as is of little Value, and improve it, by making a good Sward upon it, their E&s;tates would be greatly benefited by it.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e which at pre&s;ent is on this Spot, is very &s;mall, being what Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> found built on it by his Predece&s;&s;or; to which he has only added one hand&s;ome Room on the Back&s;ide, which is elegantly fitted up, and completely furni&s;hed with good Pictures: but as there are &s;o many better Situa|tions
<PB N="297" REF="306">
for a Hou&s;e in the middle of the Park, &s;o it is &s;uppo&s;ed this Gentleman will erect a new Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, an&s;werable to the De&s;ign of his Plantations.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Mole,</HI> which ri&s;es near <HI>Darking,</HI> pa&s;&s;es along by the Side of this Park, and in its Cour&s;e &s;erpents about in &s;o pretty a manner, as that you frequently lo&s;e the Sight of it; and by its Wind|ings make the Cour&s;e almo&s;t Four Miles within the Compa&s;s of this Inclo&s;ure. Indeed this River is very narrow, and in dry Weather the Current is exceeding &s;low, and the Water not well coloured, which, it mu&s;t be allowed, takes off from its Beauty; yet there is room for great Improvements, by &s;loping off the Banks, &s;o as to have a better View of the Water; and in many Places by taking away &s;ome of the little Projection of the Banks, it may be widened &s;o as to appear con&s;iderable at &s;ome Di&s;tance: which, if done, will add much to the Beauty of the Place.</P>
<P>Near this Place is the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Bridges,</HI> which is built in a very &s;ingular Ta&s;te, &s;omething after the Model of an <HI>Italian Villa,</HI> but very plain on the Out&s;ide. The Apartments within &s;eem very commodious, and the principal Rooms are elegantly fitted up, the Ceilings being gilt, and all the Mem|bers are richly ornamented: the Offices below are very convenient, and judiciou&s;ly contrived to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;igned. But what chiefly &s;truck my Curio&s;ity on &s;eeing it, was a fal&s;e Story contrived on each Side of the Hou&s;e, taken from the Difference in the Height of the Side-rooms, from tho&s;e principal Apartments: and the&s;e are converted into long Galleries with a &s;mall Apart|ment at one End, which affords a Communication between them. In the <HI>Attick</HI> Story there are very good Lodging-rooms, which are well laid together: &s;o that for the Size of this Hou&s;e, there is hardly any other near <HI>London,</HI> which has more u&s;eful and elegant Apartments.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="307">The Situation of the Hou&s;e is on an Eminence, &s;o that it commands the Pro&s;pect of the adjacent Fields, which are kept in very exact Order; and there is a Declivity from the Hou&s;e to the River <HI>Mole,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es along by the Side of this Gentle|man's Garden: and here it appears much more con|&s;iderable than in any other Part of its Cour&s;e; for Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI> has taken away &s;o much of the Earth of the Banks, as to make the River, in &s;ome Places, Four or Five times broader than it was naturally, &s;o that it makes a hand&s;ome Appearance. And by the Side of the Water, he has di&s;po&s;ed the Earth into a natural Slope, with a broad Gra&s;s-walk, planted with &s;weet Shrubs on each Side; and at the End of the Walk is a fine Room, which has a View of the Water lengthwi&s;e, and is a &s;weet Retreat in hot Weather, being &s;haded by large Elm-trees on the South-&s;ide, and having the Water on the North and Ea&s;t-&s;ides, which renders it very cool and plea|&s;ant. This Hou&s;e is &s;ituated about half a Mile from the publick Road to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and is &s;o much hid by the Trees near it, as not to be &s;een until you ri&s;e on the Common or Heath beyond <HI>Cobham,</HI> where in &s;everal Parts of the Road between that and <HI>Ripley,</HI> you have a fine View of it.</P>

<HEAD>Vol. I. p. 301.</HEAD>
<P>FROM <HI>Blandford</HI> I took a Turn to view one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t &s;tately new Fabricks in the Kingdom, I mean the Hou&s;e, or rather Palace, be|longing to the Right Hon. <HI>George Dodington,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> It is &s;ituated in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Gunville,</HI> Four Miles from <HI>Blandford,</HI> and Six from <HI>Shafte&s;bury</HI> and <HI>Cran|born.</HI> The Hou&s;e, Gardens and Park, containing in all about Eight Miles in Circumference, are now named <HI>Ea&s;tbury.</HI></P>
<P>It is a va&s;t and magnificent Structure, its very Of|fices, at a Di&s;tance, re&s;embling no incon&s;iderable
<PB N="299" REF="308">
Pari&s;h. You approach it through one of the mo&s;t beautiful Lawns which the Imagination can con|ceive; and pa&s;&s;ing through the grand Court, on each Side of which the Offices are ranged in treble Rows, from four Ba&s;s Courts, a mo&s;t &s;tately Portico pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, &s;upported by large and beautiful Pillars. Here you a&s;cend by many Steps between the Statues of Two Sphinxes; and having pa&s;&s;ed the Area of the Portico, you enter a mo&s;t magnificent Hall, adorned with many Statues and Bu&s;toes, and its Roof painted in a mo&s;t delicate Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Hence you proceed to the Salon; one of the no|ble&s;t Rooms in <HI>Europe,</HI> and which, with its fine Proportion, no le&s;s than the Splendor of its Gilding, cannot but &s;trike the mo&s;t indifferent Beholder.</P>
<P>At one End of this Salon is a princely Apartment, con&s;i&s;ting of Three large Rooms furni&s;hed, one with Crim&s;on, another with flowered Velvet, and the third with Satin, all richly laced with Gold. At the other End of the Salon is a Drawing-room, and very large Dining-room, both magnificently gilt, as is in|deed every Room in this Floor, except only the Hall.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Floor above Stairs is di&s;tributed into &s;eve|ral grand Apartments: but as it is not our Intention, nor have we Room to de&s;cribe it minutely, we &s;hall pa&s;s to the Gardens, which are laid out with &s;urpri&s;ing Art: but what is mo&s;t remarkable in them is the va&s;t Collection of foreign Trees of various Kinds, the beautiful Verdure of the Walks, in the mid&s;t of a Country who&s;e Turf is of another Colour, e&s;pecially in Summer. This Hou&s;e was begun by the late Mr. <HI>Dodington,</HI> and fini&s;hed by the pre&s;ent. The Architect was Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh.</HI></P>
