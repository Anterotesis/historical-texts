<HEAD><HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the armorial En&s;igns of the County of</HI> Middle&s;ex, <HI>and of the Abbey and City of</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter, <HI>by</HI> Sir John Hawkins.</HEAD>
<P>IT has lately been agitated, as a que&s;tion involving in it &s;ome circum|&s;tances re&s;pecting the hi&s;tory and antiquities of this kingdom, whether there are any armorial en&s;igns, or heraldical device, appropriated to the county of Middle&s;ex: A que&s;tion of &s;omewhat the more importance, as the determination thereof will either ju&s;tify or condemn the a&s;&s;umption of three <HI>&s;abres</HI> or <HI>falchions,</HI> for &s;o I mu&s;t at pre&s;ent term them, as the im|pre&s;s, or cognizance of that county, and the con&s;equent di&s;playing them on the colours of the we&s;tern regiment of the military corps, maintained by the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And here it is fir&s;t to be ob&s;erved, that, in the great we&s;t window of We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, there are five compartments, the fir&s;t whereof, viz. that on the &s;outh &s;ide contains the device above-mentioned, under a regal crown, or rather a circle with points. This, though by &s;ome mi&s;taken for the arms of King Alfred, it may be pre&s;umed refers to Sebert, king of the Ea&s;t Saxons, for this rea&s;on, that he was the founder of the church and convent; and that in the time of the heptarchy the &s;ame was the armorial en&s;ign of the kingdom of the Ea&s;t Saxons, as may be &s;een, together with the arms of the other kingdoms, in Speed's Chronicle, and al&s;o in Hey|lin's Help to Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, edit. 1773, page 7, with the addition of the terms of blazonry.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be thought, that the three &s;abres were the family arms of Sebert; and the family of Seber, who now bear them, attempt to ju&s;tify their claim by this &s;uppo&s;ition: but the fact is otherwi&s;e, it being pretty evi|dent, that till of very late times the arms borne by our princes were not their own, if they had any, but tho&s;e of the kingdom for the time being: even the cro&s;s and martlets, which are reputed to be Edward the Confe&s;&s;or's arms, were not peculiar to him or his family. Egbert, the fir&s;t monarch of England, took the cro&s;s as the arms of the kingdom; Alfred added thereto four martlets, and Edward the Confe&s;&s;or made them five, by the addition of one at the ba&s;e point; and as to the arms in que&s;tion, it &s;eems that they were borne by Erkenwyne, the fir&s;t of the Ea&s;t Saxon kings, and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
The arms of France and England in a quarterly bearing, the device of Edward III. who imitated therein the quartering of the arms of Ca&s;tile and Leon, was al&s;o the bearing of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as kings of England, and were <HI>Sem&eacute;e F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eur de Lys;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the field &s;own or powdered with fleurs de lys <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So Cotgrave in <HI>voce &s;em&eacute;e;</HI> and &s;ee them thus repre&s;ented in the arms of England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, at the foot of the arched beams that form the roof; al&s;o on the tomb of Edward III. in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; or to go no farther, the heads and monuments by Vertue, in Rapin's Hi&s;tory, from Edward III. to Henry V. inclu&s;ive.</NOTE>, until Charles VI. of France reduced them to three, when our Henry V. did the like: Camden's Remains, 293. and &s;o they continued.</P>
<P>It is now time to enquire after the true appellation of tho&s;e warlike weapons that compo&s;e the Ea&s;t Saxon device; and upon con&s;ulting the au|thors undermentioned, I find that that curved weapon, which I have called a &s;abre or falchion, was anciently termed a <HI>Sach,</HI> and there can be little doubt, but that from the con&s;tant u&s;e of it in battle the Saxons at large derived their name.</P>
<P>The following are the &s;entiments of &s;undry learned etymologi&s;ts on the &s;ubject:</P>
<P>Camden, among other opinions touching the denomination, mentions that of its derivation from the word <HI>Saxa,</HI> which he &s;ays gave occa&s;ion to the following rhyme of Engelhu&s;ius.</P>
<Q><L>Quippe brevis gladius, apud illos Saxa vocatur,</L>
<L>Unde &s;ibi Saxo nomen traxi&s;&s;e putatur.</L></Q>
<Q><L>The Saxon people did, as mo&s;t believe,</L>

<BIBL>Introduction to Camden's Britannia, by Bp. Gib&s;on. Edition 1753. col. 156.</BIBL>
<P>Bi&s;hop Gib&s;on, the editor of Camden, &s;eems to prefer this etymology to the others adduced by his author; and e&s;pecially to reject that opinion of Michael Neander, that the Saxons came from the Sacae or Sa&s;&s;ones of A&s;ia, in oppo&s;ition whereto he cites a pa&s;&s;age from Bi&s;hop Stillingfleet's Origines Brit. p. 305, 306, in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
<Q REND="margQuotes">"However, this original of the Saxons from the Sacae of A&s;ia may be thought too far fetched, unle&s;s there were &s;ome fair hi&s;torical account how the Saxons came to be propagated by tho&s;e Sacae; and no &s;uch account being given, it may &s;eem to be little more than a po&s;&s;ibility. Nor may that other original from the &s;hort &s;words, called Sachs, &s;eem altogether vain, when it is con&s;idered that the Quirites had their name from Quiris, a &s;hort &s;pear; and the Scythians from Scytten, to &s;hoot with a bow. Tacitus al&s;o, &s;peaking of &s;ome of the northern Germans, &s;aith, that the common badges they wear are round &s;hields and &s;hort &s;words; and the arms of Saxony to this day, as Pontanus ob&s;erves, are two &s;hort &s;words acro&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Junius, in his Etymologicon Anglicanum, Voce Sachs, is more expre&s;s to the purpo&s;e, making it to &s;ignify Cultrum, a knife; Pugio, a dagger, or poniard; and Gladius, a &s;word: More particularly he a&s;&s;erts, that the SAKS was a kind of &s;word, the blade and hilt whereof were nearly of equal length, that it had only one &s;harp edge, and was not un|like a knife for cutting meat; and adds, that in his time the Danes u&s;ed the word Sa&s;s for a pair of &s;hears. He denies, that the nation of the Saxons derived its name from the Latin, Saxum, as being a hardy, &s;tony race, as he &s;ays has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome upon the authority of I&s;idore, Lib. IX. Orig. c. 2. On the contrary, he maintains, that it came from tho&s;e knives which the Germans call Sachs. It farther appears from this author, in <HI>loc. cit.</HI> that the word Sachs has &s;ometimes been rendered by the Latin appellative Sica, a &s;hort &s;word or poniard, and he conjectures that the French Scie, a &s;aw, may be derived therefrom.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Spelman, in his Glo&s;&s;ary, Voce Saxones, cites two lines from Ro&s;witha de Ge&s;t. Odonum, which &s;eem to favor the derivation of Saxones from Saxum. Neverthele&s;s, he concurs with Junius; and to add weight to his conjecture, in the next article, viz. Saxo, renders the term by Brevis Gladius, and gives from Gothofredus Viterbien&s;is the following ver&s;es:</P>

Ver&s;tegan, though a writer of &s;omewhat le&s;s authority than any of tho&s;e above cited, is neverthele&s;s worth con&s;ulting on the &s;ubject; and the rather, as he elucidates it by the relation of &s;undry curious parti|culars, which he &s;ums up in a po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, that the Saxons had their name from this crooked, or &s;cythe-like kind of &s;word, adding, that he was confirmed in this his opinion by a conver&s;ation he once had with Ju&s;tus Lip&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s on the &s;ubject, who concurred with him therein.

<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
It &s;eems that this kind of weapon was in u&s;e al&s;o with the Spartans, for Plutarch relates, that one of that nation being je&s;ted with for wearing a &s;word &s;o &s;hort, readily an&s;wered, that it was &s;ufficiently long to reach the heart of an enemy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the foregoing te&s;timonies of the Etymologi&s;ts, do in &s;trictne&s;s prove no more than that the device of the three Seaxes was a proper and appo&s;ite de&s;ignation of the Saxon people in general, as pointing to a particular circum&s;tance in their martial oeconomy; and, &s;eeing that each of the other &s;ix kingdoms that made up the heptarchy, had as good a claim to this bearing as the latter, it may be a matter of wonder that the propriety of it did not recommend it to tho&s;e who had the fir&s;t election.</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered, that the que&s;tion now under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is not, to whom the device now &s;poken of mo&s;t properly belonged, but who were the people that fir&s;t adopted it. This is an enquiry touching a fact, which be&s;ides that it is above a&s;certained, may thus be accounted for. The kingdom of Kent was the fir&s;t founded, and the principal of the Heptarchy, and for the cognizance thereof, Hengi&s;t, who led the Saxons into Britain, di&s;played on his banner a white hor&s;e, in Saxon, Heng&s;t, in allu&s;ion to his name, and which is even now the bearing of the hou&s;e of Saxony. Ella, the fir&s;t king of the South Saxons, had taken &s;ix martlets, Cuthred of the We&s;t Saxons, a griffin. The Ea&s;t Saxon king|dom was next in the order of erection; and for that Erkenwyne made choice of the device of three Seaxes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the arms of the &s;everal kingdoms of the heptarchy in the annexed plate No. I. et &s;eq. to No. IX. Upon which it is to be ob&s;erved, that No. VI. and VII. are the arms of Bernicia and Deira, two &s;everal provinces of Northumbria, until O&s;win, king of the former, having &s;ubdued Deira, and become &s;ole monarch of Northumbria, took for the arms thereof, <HI>Azure, a cro&s;s between four lions rampant, Or,</HI> as repre&s;ented by No. VIII. Of the province of Deira, from whence Durham, qua&s;i Deirham, mention is made by Bede, in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, in which, taking occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the conver&s;ion of the Saxons to chri&s;tianity, he relates, that certain captive children being expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the market-place of Rome, Gregory, afterwards Pope, the fir&s;t of, that name, que&s;tioned them touching their country, and being an&s;wered that they were Angli, he re&s;embled them to angels; and enquiring from what province they came, and receiving for an&s;wer Deira, he replied in a quibble, le&s;s witty than benevo|lent, that they &s;hould be freed de Dei ira, from the wrath of God, &s;oon after which Augu&s;tine came hither, charged with a mi&s;&s;ion to teach and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">opagate the chri&s;tian faith.</NOTE> than which as being a generical, etymological &s;ymbol, including in the very name thereof that of the nation which a&s;&s;umed it, a more appo&s;ite one could hardly have been &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>

It is pre&s;umed, that the authorities here cited are abundantly &s;ufficient to prove, that the three Seaxes blazoned in the colours above de&s;cribed, were the proper armorial device of the kingdom of the Ea&s;t Saxons; and when it is con&s;idered, that the &s;ame con&s;i&s;ted of the counties of E&s;&s;ex and Middle|&s;ex, and part of Hertford&s;hire, and that We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;ituated in Middle|&s;ex, was the &s;eat of its kings, one of whom was the founder of the abbey there; and farther, that this county, from the di&s;&s;olution of the heptarchy down to this time, has been the principal re&s;idence of the Engli&s;h mo|narchs, and the fountain both of ju&s;tice and legi&s;lature; when the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, I &s;ay, are con&s;idered, the propriety of a&s;&s;uming, as the martial de&s;ignation of the county of Middle&s;ex, the device of that territory of which it made &s;o great and re&s;pectable a part, will hardly admit of a que&s;tion.</P>
