<HEAD>MAXIMS, OBSERVATIONS, AND REFLECTIONS, Taken from the GUARDIAN, Methodized and Connected.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>_A Good Con&s;cience is to the Soul what Health is to the Body; it pre&s;erves a con&s;tant Ea&s;e and Serenity within us, and more than countervails all the Calamities and Afflictions which can po&s;&s;ibly befal us. I know nothing &s;o hard for a generous Mind to get over as Calumny and Reproach, and cannot find any Method of quieting the Soul under them, be&s;ides this &s;ingle one, of our being con&s;cious to our &s;elves that we do not de&s;erve them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<HEAD>RELIGIOUS FEAR.</HEAD>
<P>_REligious Fear, when it is produced by ju&s;t Apprehen|&s;ions of a Divine Power, naturally overlooks all hu|man Greatne&s;s that &s;tands in Competition with it, and extingui&s;hes every other Terrour that can &s;ettle it&s;elf in the Heart of Man; it le&s;&s;ens and con|tracts the Figure of the mo&s;t exalted Per&s;on; it di&s;arms the Tyrant and Ex|ecutioner, and repre&s;ents to our Minds the mo&s;t enraged and the mo&s;t power|ful as altogether harmle&s;s and impotent.</P>
<P>There is no true Fortitude which is not founded upon this Fear, as there is no other Principle of &s;o &s;ettled and fixed a Nature. Courage that grows from Con&s;titution, very often for|&s;akes a Man when he has Occa&s;ion for it; and, when it is only a Kind of In&s;tinct in the Soul, breaks out on all Occa&s;ions without Judgment or Di&s;cretion. That Courage which pro|ceeds from the Sen&s;e of our Duty, and from the Fear of offending him that made us, acts always in a uniform Man|ner,
<PB N="3" REF="9">
and according to the Dictates of right Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>What can the Man fear, who takes Care, in all his Actions to plea&s;e a Be|ing that is Omnipotent? a Being who is able to cru&s;h all his Adver&s;aries? a Being, that can divert any Misfortune from befalling him, or turn any &s;uch Misfortune to his Advantage? The Per|&s;on who lives with this con&s;tant and habitual Regard to the great Superin|tendant of the World, is indeed &s;ure that no real Evil can come into his Lot. Ble&s;&s;ings may appear under the Shape of Pains, Lo&s;&s;es, and Di&s;appointments, but let him have Patience, and he will &s;ee them in their proper Figures. Dan|gers may threaten him, but he may re&s;t &s;atisfied, that they will either not reach him, or, that if they do, they will be the In&s;truments of Good to him. In &s;hort, he may look upon all Cro&s;&s;es and Accidents, Sufferings and Afflictions, as Means which are made U&s;e of to bring him to Happine&s;s. This is even the wor&s;t of that Man's Condition who&s;e Mind is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the habitual Fear of which I am now &s;peaking. But it very often happens, that tho&s;e which appear Evils in our own Eyes, appear al&s;o as &s;uch to him
<PB N="4" REF="10">
who has Human Nature under his Care, in which Ca&s;e they are certainly avert|ed from the Per&s;on who has made himself, by this Virtue, an Object of Divine Favour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>_THere is no Virtue &s;o truly great and God-like as JUSTICE. Mo&s;t of the other Virtues are the Virtues of created Beings, or accommodated to our Nature as we are Men. JUSTICE is that which is practi&s;ed by God him|&s;elf, and to be practi&s;ed in its Per|fection by none but him. Omni&s;cience and Omnipotence are requi&s;ite for the full Exertion of it. The one, to di&s;co|ver every Degree of Uprightne&s;s, or Iniquity in Thoughts, Words and Actions. The other, to mea&s;ure out and impart &s;uitable Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments.</P>
<P>As to be perfectly ju&s;t is an Attri|bute in the Divine Nature, to be &s;o to the utmo&s;t of our Abilities is the Glory of a Man. Such an one, who has the publick Admini&s;tration in his
<PB N="5" REF="11">
Hands, acts like the Repre&s;entative of his Maker, in recompen&s;ing the Virtu|ous, and puni&s;hing the Offender.</P>
<P>When a Nation once lo&s;es its Regard to JUSTICE; when they do not look up|on it as &s;omething venerable, holy and inviolable; when any of them dare pre&s;ume to le&s;&s;en, affront, or terrify tho&s;e who have the Di&s;tribution of it in their Hands; when a Judge is ca|pable of being influenced by any Thing but Law, or a Cau&s;e may be recom|mended by any Thing that is foreign to its own Merits, we may venture to pronounce that &s;uch a Nation is ha|&s;tening to its Ruin.</P>
<P>JUSTICE di&s;cards Party, Friend&s;hip, Kindred, and is therefore always repre|&s;ented as blind, that we may &s;uppo&s;e her Thoughts are wholly intent on the Equity of a Cau&s;e, without being di|verted or prejudiced by Objects foreign to it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<HEAD>CHARITY.</HEAD>
<P>_CHARITY is a Virtue of the Heart, and not of the Hands, &s;ays an old Writer. Gifts and Alms are the Expre&s;&s;i|ons, not the E&s;&s;ence of this Virtue. A Man may be&s;tow great Sums on the Poor and Indigent, without be|ing Charitable, and may be Charitable, when he is not able to be&s;tow any Thing. Charity is therefore a Habit of Good-Will, or Benevolence, in the Soul, which di&s;po&s;es us to the Love, A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Relief of Mankind, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who &s;tand in Need of it. The poor Man, who has this excellent Frame of Mind, is no le&s;s intitled to the Reward of this Virtue, than the Man who founds a College.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="7" REF="13">
<HEAD>KNOWLEDGE.</HEAD>
<P>_KNOWLEDGE is indeed that which, next to Virtue, tru|ly and e&s;&s;entially rai&s;es one Man above another. It fi|ni&s;hes one Half of the hu|man Soul. It makes Being plea&s;ant to us, fills the Mind with entertaining Views, and admini&s;ters to it a perpe|tual Series of Gratifications. It gives Ea&s;e to Solitude, and Gracefulne&s;s to Retirement. It fills a publick Station with &s;uitable Abilities, and adds a Lu|&s;tre to tho&s;e who are in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>LEARNING, by which I mean all u&s;e|ful Knowledge, whether &s;peculative or practical, is, in popular and mixed Governments, the natural Source of Wealth and Honour. If we look into mo&s;t of the Reigns from the Conque&s;t, we &s;hall find, that the Favourites of each Reign have been tho&s;e who have rai&s;ed them&s;elves. The greate&s;t Men are generally the Growth of that particular Age in which they flouri&s;h. A &s;upe|riour Capacity for Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a more
<PB N="8" REF="14">
exten&s;ive Knowledge, are the Steps by which a new Man often mounts to Fa|vour, and out&s;hines the re&s;t of his Con|emporaries. But when Men are actually born to Titles, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould fail of receiving an addi|tional Greatne&s;s, if they take Care to ac|compli&s;h them&s;elves for it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>NOBILITY.</HEAD>
<P>_WE ought in Gratitude to honour the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e who have rai&s;ed either the Intere&s;t, or Reputation of their Coun|try, and by who&s;e Labours we our&s;elves are more Happy, Wi&s;e, or Virtuous, than we &s;hould have been without them. Be&s;ides, naturally &s;peak|ing, a Man bids fairer for Greatne&s;s of Soul, who is the De&s;cendant of worthy Ance&s;tors, and has good Blood in his Veins, than one who is come of an ignoble and ob&s;cure Parentage. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons I think a Man of Merit, who is derived from an illu&s;trious Line, is very ju&s;tly to be regarded more than a Man of equal Merit, who has no Claim to hereditary Honours.
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Nay, I think tho&s;e who are indifferent in them&s;elves, and have nothing el&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h them, but the Virtues of their Forefathers, are to be looked upon with a Degree of Veneration, even up|on that Account, and to be more re|&s;pected than the common Run of Men, who are of low and vulgar Extraction.</P>
<P>After having thus a&s;cribed due Ho|nours to Birth and Parentage, I mu&s;t, however, take Notice of tho&s;e, who ar|rogate to them&s;elves more Honours than are due to them on this Account. The fir&s;t are &s;uch who are not enough &s;en|&s;ible that Vice and Ignorance taint the Blood, and that an unworthy Behaviour degrades and di&s;ennobles a Man, in the Eye of the World, as much as Birth and Family aggrandize and exalt him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd are tho&s;e who believe a new Man of an elevated Merit, is not more to be honoured than an in&s;ignifi|cant and worthle&s;s Man, who is de&s;cend|ed from a long Line of Patriots and Heroes; or, in other Words, behold with Contempt a Per&s;on who is &s;uch a Man as the fir&s;t Founder of their Family was, upon who&s;e Reputation they value them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">There are &s;ome who&s;e Quality fits uppermo&s;t in all their Di&s;cour&s;es and Behaviour. An empty Man of a great Family is a Creature that is &s;carce con|ver&s;ible: You read his Ance&s;try in his Smile, in his Air, in his Eye-brow; he has indeed his Nobility to give Employ|ment to his Thoughts; Rank and Pre|cedency are the important Points which he is always di&s;cu&s;&s;ing within him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>To conclude,</HI> There is nothing more ea|&s;y than to di&s;cover a Man who&s;e Heart is full of his Family; weak Minds, that have imbibed a &s;trong Tincture of the <HI>Nur|&s;ery,</HI> younger Brothers that have been brought up to Nothing, &s;uperannuated Retainers to a great Hou&s;e, have general|ly their Thoughts taken up with little el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>But on the other Hand, As</HI> the Actions of our Ance&s;tors and Forefathers &s;hould excite us to every Thing that is Great and Virtuous; &s;o a Regard to our Po&s;te|rity, and tho&s;e who are to de&s;cend from us, ought to have the &s;ame Kind of In|fluence on a generous Mind. A noble Soul would rather die than commit an Action that &s;hould make his Children blu&s;h, when he is in the Grave, and be looked upon as a Reproach to tho&s;e who &s;hall live a hundred Years after
<PB N="11" REF="17">
him. On the contrary, nothing can be a more plea&s;ing Thought to a Man of Eminence, than to con&s;ider that his Po&s;terity, who lie many Removes from him, &s;hall make their Boa&s;t of his Vir|tues, and be honoured for his Sake.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FALSE GALLANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>_THere are a Sort of Knights-Errant in the World, who, quite contrary to tho&s;e in Romance, are perpetually &s;eeking Adventures to bring Virgins into Di&s;tre&s;s, and to ruin Inno|cence. When Men of Rank and Fi|gure pa&s;s away their Lives in the&s;e Criminal Pur&s;uits and Practices, they ought to con&s;ider, that they render them&s;elves more vile and de&s;picable than any innocent Man can be, what|ever low Station his Fortune or Birth have placed him in. Title and Ance|&s;try render a good Man more illu&s;trious, but an ill one more contemptible.</P>
<P>I have often wondered, that the&s;e Deflowrers of Innocence, though dead to all the Sentiments of Virtue and Honour, are not re&s;trained by Compa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="12" REF="18">
and Humanity. To bring Sorrow, Confu&s;ion and Infamy into a Family, to wound the Heart of a tender Parent, and &s;tain the Life of a poor deluded young Woman with a Di&s;honour that can never be wiped off, are Circum&s;tan|ces one would think, &s;ufficient to check the mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion in a Heart, which has the lea&s;t Tincture of Pity and Good-nature. Would any one pur|cha&s;e the Gratification of a Moment at &s;o dear a Rate? and entail a la&s;ting Mi|&s;ery on others, for &s;uch a tran&s;ient Sa|tisfaction to him&s;elf? nay, for a Satis|faction that is &s;ure, at &s;ome Time or other, to be followed with Remor&s;e?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the CONDUCT of FAMILIES.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is a melancholy Thing to &s;ee a Coxcomb at the Head of a Family: He &s;catters In|fection through the whole Hou&s;e, his Wife and Chil|dren have always their Eyes upon him: If they have more Sen&s;e than him&s;elf, they are out of Countenance for him; if le&s;s, they &s;ubmit their Under&s;tand|ings to him, and make daily Improve|ments
<PB N="13" REF="19">
in Folly and Impertinence. I have been very often &s;ecretly concerned, when I have &s;een a Circle of pretty Children cramped in their natural Parts, and prattling even below them&s;elves, while they are talking after a Couple of &s;illy Parents. The Dulne&s;s of a Fa|ther often extingui&s;hes a Genius in the Son, or gives &s;uch a wrong Ca&s;t to his Mind, as it is hard for him ever to wear off. In &s;hort, where the Head of a Fa|mily is weak, you hear the Repetitions of his in&s;ipid Plea&s;antries, &s;hallow Con|ceits, and topical Points of Mirth, in every Member of it: His Table, his Fire-Side, his Parties of Diver&s;ion, are all of them &s;o many &s;tanding Scenes of Folly.</P>
<P>This is one Rea&s;on why I would the more recommend the Improvements of the Mind to my Female Readers, that a Family may have a double Chance for it, and, if it meets with Weakne&s;s in one of the Heads, may have it made up in the other. It is indeed an unhap|py Circum&s;tance in a Family, where the Wife has more Knowledge than the Hu&s;band; but it is better it &s;hould be &s;o, than that there &s;hould be no Know|ledge in the whole Hou&s;e. It is high|ly expedient that at lea&s;t one of the
<PB N="14" REF="20">
Per&s;ons, who &s;its at the Helm of Affairs, &s;hould give an Example of good Sen&s;e to tho&s;e who are under them, in the&s;e little dome&s;tick Governments.</P>
<P>If Folly is of ill Con&s;equence in the Head of a Family, Vice is much more &s;o, as it is of a more pernicious and of a more contagious Nature. When the Ma&s;ter is a Profligate, the Rake runs through the Hou&s;e: You hear the Sons talking loo&s;ely and &s;wearing after their Father, and &s;ee the Daughters either familiarized to his Di&s;cour&s;e, or every Moment blu&s;hing for him.</P>
<P>The very Footman will be a fine Gen|tleman in his Ma&s;ter's Way; he im|proves by his Table-Talk, and repeats in the Kitchin what he learns in the Parlour: Inve&s;t him with the &s;ame Ti|tle and Ornaments, and you would &s;carce know him from his Lord; he practi&s;es the &s;ame Oaths, the &s;ame Ribaldry, the &s;ame Way of Joking.</P>
<P>It is therefore of very great Concern to a Family, that the Ruler of it &s;hould be wi&s;e and Virtuous: The fir&s;t of the&s;e Qualifications does not indeed lie with|in his Power; but, though a Man can|not ab&s;tain from being weak, he may from being vicious. It is in his Power to give a good Example of Mode&s;ty,
<PB N="15" REF="21">
of Temperance, of Frugality, of Reli|gion, and of all other Virtues, which, though the greate&s;t Ornaments of Hu|man Nature, may be put in Practice by Men of the mo&s;t ordinary Capacities.</P>
<P>As Wi&s;dom and Virtue are the proper Qualifications in the Ma&s;ter of a Hou&s;e, if he is not accompli&s;hed in both of them, it is much better that he &s;hould be deficient in the former than in the lat|ter, &s;ince the Con&s;equences of Vice are of an infinitely more dangerous Nature than tho&s;e of Folly.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The QUALIFICATIONS of a Good WIFE, from Sir <HI>THOMAS MORE</HI>'s Latin Original.</HEAD>
<P>_MAY you meet with a Wife who is not always &s;tupidly &s;i|lent, nor always pratling Non|&s;en&s;e! May &s;he be <HI>Learned,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, or, at lea&s;t, ca|pable of being made &s;o! A Woman thus accompli&s;hed will be always draw|ing Sentences and Maxims of Virtue out of the be&s;t Authors of Antiquity: She will be <HI>her&s;elf</HI> in all Changes of Fortune, neither blown up in Pro&s;peri|ty,
<PB N="16" REF="22">
nor broken with Adver&s;ity: You will find in her an even, chearful, good-hu|moured Friend, and an agreeable Com|panion for Life: She will infu&s;e Know|ledge into your Children with their Milk, and from their Infancy train them up to Wi&s;dom. Whatever Company you are engaged in, you will long to be at Home, and retire with Delight from the Society of <HI>Men,</HI> into the Bo&s;om of one, who is &s;o dear, &s;o knowing, and &s;o ami|able. If &s;he touches her Lute, or &s;ings to it any of her own Compo&s;itions, her Voice will &s;ooth you in your Soli|tudes, and &s;ound more &s;weetly in your Ear than that of the Nightingale: You will wa&s;te with Plea&s;ure whole Days and Nights in her Conver&s;ation, and be ever finding out new Beauties in her Di&s;|cour&s;e: She will keep your Mind in perpetual Serenity, re&s;train its Mirth from being di&s;&s;olute, and prevent its Melancholy from being painful.</P>

<HEAD>PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is no Pa&s;&s;ion which &s;teals into the Heart more imperceptibly, and covers it|&s;elf under more Di&s;gui&s;es than PRIDE. I have been always wonderfully delighted with that Sentence in Holy Writ, <Q REND="inline"><HI>Pride was not made for Man.</HI></Q> There is not indeed any &s;ingle View of Human Nature, under its pre&s;ent Condition, which is not &s;uf|ficient to extingui&s;h in us all the &s;e|cret Seeds of Pride; and, on the con|trary, to &s;ink the Soul into the lowe&s;t State of Humility, and what the School|men call Self-Annihilation. Pride was not made for Man; as he is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. A &s;inful,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. An ignorant,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A mi&s;erable Being.</ITEM>
</LIST>
There is nothing in his Under&s;tanding, in his Will, or in his pre&s;ent Condition, that can tempt any con&s;iderate Creature to Pride or Vanity.</P>
<P>The&s;e three very Rea&s;ons why he &s;hould not be proud, are notwith&s;tanding the Rea|&s;ons why he is &s;o. Were he not a &s;inful
<PB N="18" REF="24">

<HEAD>INDUSTRY.</HEAD>
<P>_IT has been ob&s;erved by Wri|ters of Morality, that in Or|der to quicken Human Indu|&s;try, Providence has &s;o con|trived it, that our daily Food is not to be procured without much Pains and Labour. The Chace of Birds and Bea&s;ts, the &s;everal Arts of Fi&s;hing, with all the different Kinds of Agriculture, are nece&s;&s;ary Scenes of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and give Employment to the greate&s;t Part of Mankind. If we look into the Brute Creation, we find all its Individuals en|gaged in a painful and laborious Way of Life, to procure a nece&s;&s;ary Sub&s;i|&s;tance for them&s;elves, or tho&s;e that grow up under them: The Pre&s;ervation of their Being is the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of it. An idle Man is therefore a Kind of Mon|&s;ter in the Creation. All Nature is bu&s;y about him; every Animal he &s;ees re|proaches him. Let &s;uch a Man, who lies as a Burden, or dead Weight, upon

<HEAD>The REPROACH of IDLENESS.</HEAD>
<P>_IN comparing together the INDUSTRY of Man with that of other Creatures, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that not|with&s;tanding we are obliged by Duty to keep our&s;elves in con&s;tant Employ, after the &s;ame Manner as infe|rior Animals are prompted to it by In|&s;tinct, we fall very &s;hort of them in this Particular. We are here the more inex|cu&s;able, becau&s;e there is a greater Vari|ety of Bu&s;ine&s;s, to which we may apply our&s;elves. Rea&s;on opens to us a large Field of Affairs, which other Creatures are not capable of. Bea&s;ts of Prey, and, I believe, of all other Kinds, in their natural State of Being, divide their Time between Action and Re&s;t. They are always at work or a&s;leep: In &s;hort,
<PB N="21" REF="27">
their waking Hours are wholly taken up in &s;eeking after their Food, or in con&s;uming it. The Human Species on|ly, to the great Reproach of our Na|tures, are filled with Complaints, that <HI>the Day hangs heavy on them, that they do not know what to do with them&s;elves, that they are at a Lo&s;s how to pa&s;s away their Time,</HI> with many of the like &s;hame|ful Murmurs, which we often find in the Mouths of tho&s;e who are &s;tiled Rea&s;onable Beings. How mon&s;trous are &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions among Creatures, who have the Labours of the Mind, as well as tho&s;e of the Body, to furni&s;h them with proper Employments; who, be|&s;ides the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their proper Cal|lings and Profe&s;&s;ions, can apply them|&s;elves to the Duties of Religion, to Me|ditation, to the reading of u&s;eful Books, to Di&s;cour&s;e; in a Word, who may ex|erci&s;e them&s;elves in the unbounded Pur|&s;uits of Knowledge and Virtue, and eve|ry Hour of their Lives make them&s;elves wi&s;er or better than they were before.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with recommending to them the &s;ame &s;hort Self-Examina|tion. If every one of them frequently lays his Hand upon his Heart, and con|&s;iders what he is doing, it will check him in all the idle, or what is wor&s;e,
<PB N="22" REF="28">
the vicious Moments of Life; lift up his Mind, when it is running on in a Series of indifferent Actions, and encou|rage him when he is engaged in tho&s;e which are virtuous and laudable. In a Word, it will very much alleviate that Guilt which the be&s;t of Men have Rea|&s;on to acknowledge in their daily Con|fe&s;&s;ions, of <HI>leaving undone tho&s;e Things which they ought to have done, and of doing tho&s;e Things which they ought not to have done.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>_EVERY Principle that is a Motive to good Actions ought to be encouraged, &s;ince Men are of &s;o different a Make, that the &s;ame Principle does not work equally upon all Minds. What &s;ome Men are prompted to by Con|&s;cience, Duty, or Religion, which are only different Names for the &s;ame Thing, others are prompted to by HONOUR.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;e of HONOUR is of &s;o fine and delicate a Nature, that it is only to be met with in Minds which are na|turally noble; or in &s;uch as have been
<PB N="23" REF="29">
cultivated by great Examples, or a re|fined Education.</P>
<P>But as nothing is more pernicious than a Principle of Action, when it is mi&s;under&s;tood, I &s;hall con&s;ider HONOUR with Re&s;pect to three Sorts of Men. Fir&s;t of all, with Regard to tho&s;e who have a right Notion of it: Secondly, with Regard to tho&s;e who have a mi&s;ta|ken Notion of it: And, Thirdly, with Regard to tho&s;e who treat it as Chime|rical, and turn it into Ridicule.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, <HI>true HONOUR,</HI> tho' it be a different Principle from Religion, is that which produces the &s;ame Effects. The Lines of Action, though drawn from different Parts, terminate in the &s;ame Point. Religion embraces Virtue, as it is enjoined by the Laws of God; <HI>HO|NOUR,</HI> as it is graceful and ornamental to Human Nature. The Religious Man <HI>fears,</HI> the Man of <HI>HONOUR &s;corns</HI> to do an ill Action: The former con&s;iders Vice as &s;omething that is beneath him, the other as &s;omething that is offen&s;ive to the Divine Being: The one, as what is <HI>unbecoming,</HI> the other as what is <HI>forbid|den.</HI> Thus <HI>SENECA</HI> &s;peaks in the na|tural and genuine Language of a Man of <HI>Honour,</HI> when he declares, That were there no God to &s;ee or puni&s;h Vice, he
<PB N="24" REF="30">
would not commit it, becau&s;e it is of &s;o mean, &s;o ba&s;e, and &s;o vile a Nature.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Place, we are to con&s;i|der tho&s;e who have mi&s;taken Notions of <HI>Honour,</HI> and the&s;e are &s;uch as e&s;ta|bli&s;h any Thing to them&s;elves for a Point of <HI>Honour,</HI> which is contrary ei|ther to the Laws of God, or of their Country; who think it more honoura|ble to revenge, than to forgive an Inju|ry; who make no Scruple of telling a Lie, but would put any Man to Death that accu&s;es them of it; who are more careful to guard their Reputation by their Courage than by their Virtue. True Fortitude is indeed &s;o becoming in Human Nature, that he who wants it &s;carce de&s;erves the Name of a Man; but we find &s;everal, who &s;o much abu&s;e this Notion, that they place the whole Idea of <HI>Honour</HI> in a Kind of brutal Cou|rage; by which Means we have had many among us, who have called them|&s;elves Men of <HI>Honour,</HI> that would have been a Di&s;grace to a Gibbet. In a Word, the Man who &s;acrifices any Duty of a rea&s;onable Creature to a prevailing Mode or Fa&s;hion, who looks upon any Thing as honourable that is di&s;plea&s;ing to his Maker, or de&s;tructive to Society, who thinks him&s;elf obliged by this Principle
<PB N="25" REF="31">
to the Practice of &s;ome Virtues, and not of others, is by no Means to be recko|ned among true Men of Honour.</P>
<P>In the third Place, we are to con&s;ider tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who treat this Principle as chimerical, and turn it into Ridicule. Men who are profe&s;&s;edly of no Honour, are of a more profligate and abandoned Nature than even tho&s;e who are acted by fal&s;e Notions of it, as there is more Hopes of a Heretick than of an Athei&s;t. The&s;e Sons of Infamy con&s;ider Honour as a fine imaginary Notion, that leads a&s;tray young unexperienced Men, and draws them into real Mi&s;chiefs, while they are engaged in the Pur&s;uits of a Shadow. The&s;e are generally Per&s;ons who, in <HI>SHAKESPEAR</HI>'s Phra&s;e, are <Q REND="inline"><HI>worn and hackneyed in the Ways of Men</HI>;</Q> who&s;e Imaginations are grown callous, and have lo&s;t all tho&s;e delicate Senti|ments, which are natural to Minds that are innocent and undepraved. Such old battered Mi&s;creants ridicule every Thing as Romantick, that comes in Competi|tion with their pre&s;ent Intere&s;t, and treat tho&s;e Per&s;ons as Vi&s;ionaries, who dare &s;tand up in a corrupt Age for what has not its immediate Reward joined to it. The Talents, Intere&s;t, or Experience of &s;uch Men, make them &s;o very often
<PB N="26" REF="32">
u&s;eful in all Parties, and at all Times: But whatever Wealth and Dignities they may arrive at, they ought to con&s;ider, that every one &s;tands as a Blot in the Annals of his Country, who arrives at the Temple of HONOUR by any other Way than through that of VIRTUE.</P>

<P>_COMPLAISANCE renders a Su|perior amiable, an Equal a|greeable, and an Inferior acceptable.

In a Word, COMPLAISANCE is a Virtue that blends all Orders of Men together in a friendly Intercour&s;e of Words and Acti|ons, and is &s;uited to that Equality of Human Nature which every one ought to con&s;ider, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the Order and Oeconomy of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">If we could look into the &s;ecret An|gui&s;h and Affliction of every Man's Heart, we &s;hould often find that more of it ari&s;es from little imaginary Di|&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;uch as Checks, Frowns, Con|tradictions, Expre&s;&s;ions of Contempt, and (what <HI>SHAKESPEAR,</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> reckons among other Evils under the Sun)

<HEAD>His MAJESTY's Character.</HEAD>
<P>_WE have the Plea&s;ure at this Time to &s;ee a King upon the Throne, who hath too much Goodne&s;s to wi&s;h for any Power, that does not enable him to promote the Welfare of his Subjects; and too much Wi&s;dom to look upon tho&s;e as his Friends, who would make their Court to him by the Profe&s;&s;ion of an Obedience, which they never practi&s;ed, and which has always proved fatal to tho&s;e Princes who have put it to the Tryal. His Maje&s;ty gave a Proof of his Sovereign Virtues before he came to the Exerci&s;e of them in this Kingdom. His
<PB N="57" REF="63">
Inclination to Ju&s;tice led him to rule his <HI>German</HI> Subjects in the &s;ame Manner that our Con&s;titution directs him to go|vern the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He regarded tho&s;e which are our Civil Liberties, as the natural Rights of Mankind; and there|fore indulged them to a People, who pleaded no other Claim to them than his known Goodne&s;s and Humanity. This Experience of a good Prince, be|fore we had the Happine&s;s to enjoy him, mu&s;t give great Satisfaction to every thinking Man, who con&s;iders how apt Sovereignty is to deprave human Na|ture; and how many of our own Princes made very ill Figures upon the Throne, who, before they a&s;cended it, were the Favourites of the People.</P>
<P>What gives us the greate&s;t Security in the Conduct of &s;o excellent a Prince, is that Con&s;i&s;tency of Behaviour, where|by he inflexibly pur&s;ues tho&s;e Mea&s;ures which appear the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equita|ble. As he hath the Character of being the mo&s;t prudent in laying proper Schemes, he is no le&s;s remarkable for being &s;teady in accompli&s;hing what he has once concerted. Indeed, if we look into the Hi&s;tory of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and reflect upon that wonderful Series of Succe&s;&s;es which have attended him,
<PB N="58" REF="64">
I think they cannot be a&s;cribed to any Thing &s;o much as to this Uniformity and Firmne&s;s of Mind, which has al|ways di&s;covered it&s;elf in his Proceed|ings. It was by this that he &s;urmount|ed tho&s;e many Difficulties which lay in the Way to his Succe&s;&s;ion; and by which, we have Rea&s;on to hope, he will daily make all Oppo&s;ition fall be|fore him. The fickle and un&s;teady Po|liticks of our late <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchs, have been the perpetual Source of tho&s;e Di&s;|&s;en&s;ions and Animo&s;ities which have made the Nation unhappy: Whereas the con&s;tant and un&s;haken Temper of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, mu&s;t have a natu|ral Tendency to the Peace of his Go|vernment, and the Unanimity of his People.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am enumerating the publick Virtues of our Sovereign, which are &s;o conducive to the Advantage of tho&s;e who are to obey him, I cannot but take Notice, that his Maje&s;ty was bred up from his Infancy with a Love to this our Nation, under a Prince&s;s, who was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Woman of her Age, and particularly famous for her Affection to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Our Country|men were dear to him, before there was any Pro&s;pect of their being his Subjects;
<PB N="59" REF="65">
and every one knows, that nothing re|commended a Man &s;o much to the di|&s;tingui&s;hing Civilities of his Court, as the being born in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>To the Fame of his Maje&s;ty's Civil Virtues we may add the Reputation he has acquired by his martial Atchieve|ments. It is ob&s;erved by Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are particularly fond of a King who is valiant: Upon which Account his Maje&s;ty has a Title to all the E&s;teem that can be paid the mo&s;t warlike Prince; tho' at the &s;ame Time, for the Good of his Subjects, he &s;tudies to decline all Occa&s;ions of mili|tary Glory; and chu&s;es rather to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed as a Father, than as the Cap|tain of his People. I am glad his rebel|lious Subjects are too incon&s;iderable to put him upon exerting that Courage and Conduct which rai&s;ed him &s;o great a Reputation in <HI>Hungary</HI> and the <HI>Morea,</HI> when he fought again&s;t the Enemies of Chri&s;tianity; and in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> where he commanded again&s;t the great Di&s;turber of the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI> One would think there was Rea&s;on for the Opinion of tho&s;e, who make Per&s;o|nal Courage to be an Hereditary Virtue, when we &s;ee &s;o many In&s;tances of it in the Line of <HI>BRUNSWICK.</HI> To go
<PB N="60" REF="66">
no farther back than the Time of our pre&s;ent King, where can we find, among the Sovereign Hou&s;es of <HI>Europe,</HI> any other Family, that has furni&s;hed &s;o ma|ny Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed Fortitude? Three of his Maje&s;ty's Brothers have fal|len gloriou&s;ly in the Field, fighting again&s;t the Enemies of their native Country: And the Bravery of his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>WALES,</HI> is &s;till fre&s;h in our Memory, who fought, with the Spirit of his Father, at the Battle of <HI>Ande|narde,</HI> when the Children of <HI>France,</HI> and the Pretender, fled before him.</P>
<P>His Love and Regard for our Con&s;ti|tution is &s;o remarkable, that, as we are told by tho&s;e who&s;e Office it is to lay the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation before him, it is his fir&s;t Que&s;tion, upon any Matter of the lea&s;t Doubt or Difficulty, whether it be in every Point according to the Laws of the Land? He is ea&s;y of Ac|ce&s;s to tho&s;e who de&s;ire it, and is &s;o gracious in his Behaviour and Conde|&s;cen&s;ion on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that none of his Subjects retire from his Pre&s;ence without the greate&s;t Idea of his Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s. His continued Ap|plication to &s;uch publick Affairs as may conduce to the Benefit of his Kingdoms, diverts him from tho&s;e Plea&s;ures and
<PB N="61" REF="67">
Entertainments which may be indulged by Per&s;ons in a lower Station, and are pur&s;ued with Eagerne&s;s by Princes who have not the Care of the Publick &s;o much at Heart. The lea&s;t Return which we can make to &s;uch a Sovereign, is that Tribute which is always paid by hone&s;t Men, and is always acceptable to great Minds, the Prai&s;e and Approbation that are due to a virtuous and noble Cha|racter. Common Decency forbids oppro|brious Language, even to a bad Prince; and common Ju&s;tice will exact from us, towards a good Prince, the &s;ame Bene|volence and Humanity with which he treats his Subjects. Tho&s;e who are in|fluenced by Duty and Gratitude, will ri&s;e much higher in all the Expre&s;&s;ions of Affection and Re&s;pect, and think they can never do too much to advance the Glory of a Sovereign, who takes &s;o much Pains to advance their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When we have a King who has gained the Reputation of the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed Probity and Honour, and has been fa|med, through the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, for an inviolable Adherence to his Promi&s;es, we may acquie&s;ce (after his many &s;olemn Declarations) in all tho&s;e Mea&s;ures which it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to judge rightly of, unle&s;s we were let in|to
<PB N="62" REF="68">
&s;uch Schemes of Council and Intel|ligence as produce them; and there|fore we &s;hould rather turn our Thoughts upon the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of his Proceed|ings, than bu&s;y our&s;elves to form Ob|jections again&s;t them. The Con&s;ideration of his Maje&s;ty's Character &s;hould at all Times &s;uppre&s;s our Cen&s;ure of his Con|duct: And &s;ince we have never yet &s;een or heard of any fal&s;e Steps in his Be|haviour, we ought, in Ju&s;tice, to think that he governs him&s;elf by his u&s;ual Rules of Wi&s;dom and Honour, 'till we di&s;cover &s;omething to the contrary.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations ought to recon|cile to his Maje&s;ty the Hearts and Tongues of all his People: But as for tho&s;e who are ob&s;tinate, irreclaimable, profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to our pre&s;ent E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, we mu&s;t expect their Calum|nies will not only continue, but ri&s;e again&s;t him in Proportion as he pur&s;ues &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and ought to recommend him to his People.</P>
<P>Having thus far con&s;idered our Hap|pine&s;s in his Maje&s;ty's Civil and Milita|ry Character, I cannot forbear plea&s;ing my &s;elf with regarding him in the View of One, who has been always fortunate. <HI>CICERO</HI> recommends <HI>POMPEY</HI> under
<PB N="63" REF="69">
this particular Head to the <HI>Romans,</HI> with whom the Character of being Fortunate was &s;o popular, that &s;everal of their Emperors gave it a Place among their Titles. Good Fortune is often the Re|ward of Virtue, and as often the Effect of Prudence; and whether it proceeds from either of the&s;e, or from both to|gether, or whatever may be the Cau&s;e of it, every one is naturally plea&s;ed to &s;ee his Intere&s;ts conducted by a Per|&s;on who is u&s;ed to good Succe&s;s. The E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Electoral Dignity in his Maje&s;ty's Family, was a Work re&s;erved for him finally to accompli&s;h. A large Acce&s;&s;ion of Dominion fell to him by his &s;ucceeding to the Dukedom of <HI>Zell,</HI> whereby he became one of the greate&s;t Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and one of the mo&s;t powerful Per&s;ons that ever &s;tood next Heir to the Throne of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Dutchy of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>O&s;naburg,</HI> have con&s;idera|bly &s;trengthened his Intere&s;ts in the Em|pire, and given a great additional Weight to the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e. But the mo&s;t remarkable Interpo&s;itions of Providence, in Favour of him, have appeared in re|moving tho&s;e &s;eemingly invincible Ob&s;ta|cles to his Succe&s;&s;ion; in taking away, at &s;o critical a Juncture, the Per&s;on who
<PB N="64" REF="70">
might have proved a dangerous Enemy; in confounding the &s;ecret and open At|tempts of his traiterous Subjects; and in giving him the delightful Pro&s;pect of tran&s;mitting his Power through a nume|rous and &s;till-increa&s;ing Progeny.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is not to be doubted but every wi&s;e and hone&s;t Sub|ject will concur with Providence in pro|moting the Glory and Happine&s;s of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, who is endowed with all tho&s;e Royal Virtues, that will natu|rally &s;ecure to us the national Ble&s;&s;ings, which ought to be dear and valuable to a free People.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCESS's Character.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN this excellent Prince&s;s was yet in her Father's Court, &s;he was &s;o celebrated for the Beauty of her Per&s;on, and the Accompli&s;hments of her Mind, that there was no Prince in the Empire, who had Room for &s;uch an Alliance, that was not ambitious of gaining her into his Family, either as a Daughter, or as a Con&s;ort. He, who is now the Chief of the crowned Heads in <HI>Europe,</HI> and
<PB N="65" REF="71">
was then King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Heir to all the Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> &s;ought her in Marriage. Could her Mind have been captivated with the Glories of this World, &s;he had them all laid before her; but &s;he generou&s;ly de|clined them, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw the Accep|tance of them was incon&s;i&s;tent with what &s;he e&s;teems more than all the Glo|ries of this World, the Enjoyment of her Religon. Providence however kept in Store a Reward for &s;uch an exalted Virtue; and, by the Methods of its Wi&s;|dom, opened a Way for her to become the greate&s;t of her Sex, among tho&s;e, who profe&s;s that Faith to which &s;he adhered with &s;o much Chri&s;tian Mag|nanimity.</P>
<P>This her illu&s;trious Conduct might, in the Eye of the World, have lo&s;t its Merit, had &s;o accompli&s;hed a Prince as his Royal Highne&s;s declared his Pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ame Alliance at that Time: It would then have been no Wonder that all other Propo&s;als had been rejected. But it was the Fame of this heroick Con&s;tancy that determined his Royal Highne&s;s to de&s;ire in Marriage a Prince&s;s, who&s;e per&s;o|nal Charms, which had been before &s;o uni|ver&s;ally admired, were now become the lea&s;t Part of her Character. We of the
<PB N="66" REF="72">
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation have Rea&s;on to rejoice, that &s;uch a Propo&s;al was made and accept|ed; and that her Royal Highne&s;s, with Regard to the&s;e two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Treaties of Marriage, &s;hewed as much Prudence in her Compliance with the one, as Pi|ety in her Refu&s;al of the other.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s was no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Hanover,</HI> than &s;he improved the Lu&s;tre of that Court, which was before recko|ned among the Polite&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI>; and increa&s;ed the Satisfaction of that Peo|ple, who were before looked upon as the Happie&s;t in the Empire. She im|mediately became the Darling of the Prince&s;s <HI>SOPHIA,</HI> who was acknow|ledged in all the Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> the mo&s;t acompli&s;hed Woman of the Age in which &s;he lived, and who was not a lit|tle plea&s;ed with the Conver&s;ation of one in whom &s;he &s;aw &s;o lively an Image of her own Youth.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no longer on that Reputation which her Royal Highne&s;s has acquired in other Countries. We daily di&s;cover tho&s;e admirable Qualities for which &s;he is &s;o ju&s;tly famed, and rejoyce to &s;ee them exerted in our own Country, where we our&s;elves are made happy by their Influence. We are the more plea&s;ed to behold the Throne of
<PB N="67" REF="73">
the&s;e Kingdoms &s;urrounded by a numerous and beautiful Progeny, when we con&s;i|der the Virtues of tho&s;e from whom they de&s;cend. Not only the Features, but the Mind of the Parent is often copied out in the Offspring. But the Prince&s;s we are &s;peaking of, takes the &s;ure&s;t Method of making her Royal I&s;|&s;ue like her&s;elf, by in&s;tilling early into their Minds all the Principles of Reli|gion, Virtue, and Honour, and &s;ea&s;oning their tender Years with all that Know|ledge which they are capable of receiv|ing. What may we not hope from &s;uch an uncommon Care in the Education of the Children of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who are directed by &s;uch Precepts, and will be formed by &s;uch an Example.</P>
<P>The Conjugal Virtues are &s;o remarka|ble in her Royal Highne&s;s, as to de&s;erve tho&s;e ju&s;t and generous Returns of Love and Tenderne&s;s, for which the Prince her Hu&s;band is &s;o univer&s;ally celebrated.</P>
<P>But there is no Part of her Royal Highne&s;s's Character, which we ob&s;erve with greater Plea&s;ure, than that Beha|viour by which &s;he has &s;o much endeared her&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty; though indeed we have no Rea&s;on to be &s;urprized at this mutual Intercour&s;e of Duty and Af|fection, when we con&s;ider &s;o wi&s;e and
<PB N="68" REF="74">
virtuous a Prince&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, in the &s;ame &s;acred Per&s;on, the kinde&s;t of Fa|thers and the be&s;t of Kings. And here it is natural for us to congratulate our own good Fortune, who &s;ee our Sove|reign ble&s;t with a numerous I&s;&s;ue, among whom are Heirs Male in two direct De|&s;cents, which has not happened in the Reign of any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King &s;ince the Time of his Maje&s;ty's Great Ance&s;tor <HI>Edward</HI> III. and is a Felicity not enjoyed by the Subjects of any other of the Kings of <HI>Europe</HI> who are his Contemporaries. We are like Men entertained with the View of a &s;pacious Land &s;kip, where the Eye pa&s;&s;es over one plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect into another, 'till the Sight is lo&s;t by Degrees in a Succe&s;&s;ion of delightful Objects, and leaves us in the Per&s;ua&s;ion that there re|main &s;till more behind.</P>
<P>But if we regard her Royal Highne&s;s in that Light which diffu&s;es the greate&s;t Glory round a Human Character, we &s;hall find the Chri&s;tian no le&s;s con&s;pi|cuous than the Prince&s;s. She is as e|minent for a &s;incere Piety in the Pra|ctice of Religion, as for an inviolable Adherence to its Principles. She is con|&s;tant in her Attendance on the daily Offices of our Church, and by her &s;e|rious and devout Comportment on the&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="75">
&s;olemn Occa&s;ions, gives an Example that is very often too much wanted in Courts.</P>
<P>Her Religion is equally free from the Weakne&s;s of Super&s;tition, and the Sour|ne&s;s of Enthu&s;ia&s;m. It is not of that uncomfortable melancholy Nature which di&s;appoints its own End, by appearing unamiable to tho&s;e whom it would gain to its Intere&s;ts. It di&s;covers it&s;elf in the genuine Effects of Chri&s;tianity, in Affa|bility, Compa&s;&s;ion, Benevolence, Even|ne&s;s of Mind, and all the Offices of an active and univer&s;al Charity.</P>
<P>As a cheerful Temper is the nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of the&s;e Virtues, &s;o it &s;hines out in all the Parts of her Conver&s;ation, and di&s;&s;ipates tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions which na|turally hang on the Timorous or the Mo|de&s;t, when they are admitted to the Ho|nour of her Pre&s;ence. There is none that does not li&s;ten with Plea&s;ure to a Per&s;on in &s;o high a Station, who conde|&s;cends to make her&s;elf thus agreeable, by Mirth without Levity, and Wit without Ill-Nature.</P>
<P>Her Royal Highne&s;s is, indeed, po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of all tho&s;e Talents which make Conver&s;ation either delightful or impro|ing. As &s;he has a fine Ta&s;te of the ele|gant Arts, and is &s;killed in &s;everal mo|dern Languages, her Di&s;cour&s;e is not
<PB N="70" REF="76">
confined to the ordinary Subjects or Forms of Conver&s;ation, but can adapt it&s;elf with an uncommon Grace to eve|ry Occa&s;ion, and entertain the polite&s;t Per&s;ons of different Nations. I need not mention, what is ob&s;erved by every one, that agreeable Turn which appears in her Sentiments upon the mo&s;t ordinary Affairs of Life, and which is &s;o &s;uitable to the Delicacy of her Sex, the Polite|ne&s;s of her Education, and the Splendor of her Quality.</P>

<P>_THE Horror with which we entertain the Thoughts of <HI>Death,</HI> or indeed of any fu|ture Evil) and the Uncer|tainty of its Approach, fill a melancholy Mind with innumerable Ap|prehen&s;ions and Su&s;picions, and con&s;e|quently di&s;po&s;e it to the Ob&s;ervation of many groundle&s;s Prodigies and Predicti|ons. For as it is the chief Concern of wi&s;e Men to retrench the Evils of Life,

He &s;ees at one View the whole Thread of our Exi&s;tence, not only that Part of it which we have already pa&s;&s;ed through, but that which runs forward into all the Depths of Eternity. When we lay us down to Sleep, let us recommend our&s;elves to his Care; when we awake, let us give up our&s;elves to his Direction; amid&s;t all the Evils that threaten us, let us look up to him for Help, and que|&s;tion not but he will either avert them, or turn them to our Advantage. Tho' we know neither the Time nor the Man|ner of the Death we are to die, we need not be at all &s;olicitous about it; becau&s;e we are &s;ure that he knows them both, and that he will not fail to comfort and &s;upport us under them.</P>

<HEAD>TRUE HAPPINESS.</HEAD>
<P>_TRUE HAPPINESS is of a re|tired Nature, and an Enemy to Pomp and Noi&s;e; it ari&s;es, in the fir&s;t Place, from the Enjoyment of one's &s;elf; and in the next, from the Friend&s;hip and Conver|&s;ation of a few &s;elect Companions: It loves Shades and Solitude, and natural|ly haunts Groves and Fountains, Fields and Meadows: In &s;hort, it feels every Thing it wants within it&s;elf, and re|ceives no Addition from Multitudes of Witne&s;&s;es and Spectators. On the Con|trary, fal&s;e Happine&s;s loves to be in a Crowd, and to draw the Eyes of the World upon her: She does not receive any Satisfaction from the Applau&s;es which &s;he gives her&s;elf, but from the Admiration &s;he rai&s;es in others: She flouri&s;hes in Courts and Palaces, Thea|tres and A&s;&s;embl&egrave;es, and has no Exi&s;tence but when &s;he is looked upon.</P>

<HEAD>CALUMNY; or, the Danger of <HI>SATIRE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THERE is nothing that more betrays a ba&s;e and ungene|rous Spirit, than the giving of &s;ecret Stabs to a Man's Reputation. Lampoons and Satires, that are written with Wit and Spirit, are like poi&s;oned Darts, which not only inflict a Wound, but make it incurable. For this Rea&s;on I am very much troubled, when I &s;ee the Talents of Humour and Ridicule in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of an ill-natured Man. There can|not be a greater Gratification to a barba|rous and inhuman Wit, than to &s;tir up Sorrow in the Heart of a private Per&s;on, to rai&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;s among near Rela|tions, and to expo&s;e whole Families to Deri&s;ion, at the &s;ame Time that he re|mains un&s;een and undi&s;covered. If be|&s;ides the Accompli&s;hments of being wit|ty and ill-natured, a Man is vicious into the Bargain, he is one of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Creatures that can en|ter into a civil Society. His Satire will then chiefly fall upon tho&s;e who ought to be the mo&s;t exempt from it. Virtue,
<PB N="75" REF="81">
Merit, and every Thing that is Prai&s;e|worthy, will be made the Subject of Ridicule and Buffoonry. It is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate the Evils which ari&s;e from the&s;e Arrows that fly in the Dark; and I know no other Excu&s;e that is or can be made for them, than that the Wounds they give are only imaginary, and pro|duce nothing more than a &s;ecret Shame and Sorrow in the Mind of the &s;uffer|ing Per&s;on. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed; that a Lampoon or a Satire do not car|ry in them Robbery or Murder; but at the &s;ame Time, how many are there, that would not rather lo&s;e a con&s;iderable Sum of Money, or even Life it&s;elf, than be &s;et up as a Mark of Infamy and De|ri&s;ion? And in this Ca&s;e a Man &s;hould con&s;ider, that an Injury is not to be mea|&s;ured by the Notions of him that gives, but of him that receives it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who can put the be&s;t Countenance upon Outrages of this Nature which are offered them, are not without their &s;ecret Angui&s;h: For my own Part, I would never tru&s;t a Man that I thought was capable of giving the&s;e &s;ecret Wounds; and cannot but think that he would hurt the Per|&s;on, who&s;e Reputation he thus a&s;&s;aults, in his Body or in his Fortune, could he do it with the &s;ame Security. There
<PB N="76" REF="82">
is indeed &s;omething very barbarous and inhuman in the ordinary Scribblers of Lampoons. An innocent young Lady &s;hall be expo&s;ed for an unhappy Fea|ture. A Father of a Family turned to Ridicule, for &s;ome dome&s;tick Calamity. A Wife be made unea&s;y all her Life, for a mi&s;-interpreted Word or Action. Nay, a good, a temperate, and a ju&s;t Man, &s;hall be put out of Countenance, by the Repre&s;entation of tho&s;e Quali|ties that &s;hould do him Honour. So pernicious a Thing is Wit, when it is not tempered with Virtue and Humani|ty. I have indeed heard of heedle&s;s in|con&s;iderate Writers, that without any Malice have &s;acrificed the Reputation of their Friends and Acquaintance to a certain Levity of Temper, and a &s;illy Ambition of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by a Spirit of Raillery and Satire: As if it were not infinitely more honourable to be a good-natured Man than a Wit. Where there is this little petulant Humour in an Author, he is often very mi&s;chie|vous without de&s;igning to be &s;o. For which Rea&s;on I always lay it down as a Rule, that an indi&s;creet Man is more hurtful than an ill-natured one; for as the former will only attack tho&s;e he wi&s;hes well to, the other injures indif|ferently both Friends and Foes.</P>

<HEAD>AVARICE and LUXURY.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen a Government flouri&s;hes in Conque&s;ts, and is &s;ecure from foreign Attacks, it na|turally falls into all the Plea&s;ures of LUXURY; and as the&s;e Plea&s;ures are very expen&s;ive, they put tho&s;e who are addicted to them upon rai&s;ing fre&s;h Supplies of Mo|ney, by all the Methods of Rapaciou&s;ne&s;s and Corruption; &s;o that AVARICE and LUXURY very often become one com|plicated Principle of Action, in tho&s;e who&s;e Hearts are wholly &s;et upon Ea&s;e, Magnificence, and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t elegant and correct of all the <HI>Latin</HI> Hi&s;torians ob&s;erves, that in his Time, when the mo&s;t formidable States of the World were &s;ubdued by the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Republick &s;unk into tho&s;e two Vices of a quite different Nature, LUXURY and AVARICE: And accordingly de&s;cribes <HI>CATILINE</HI> as one who coveted the Wealth of other Men, at the &s;ame Time that he &s;quandered away his own. This Ob&s;ervation on the Commonwealth, when it was in its
<PB N="79" REF="85">
Height of Power and Riches, holds good of all Governments that are &s;ettled in a State of Ea&s;e and Pro&s;perity. At &s;uch Times Men naturally endeavour to out|&s;hine one another in Pomp and Splen|dor, and, having no Fears to alarm them, indulge them&s;elves in the Enjoy|ment of all the Plea&s;ures they can get into their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which naturally produces AVARICE, and an immoderate Pur&s;uit after Wealth and Riches.</P>

<HEAD>Of FAME, and the Pur&s;uit after it.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is very &s;trange to con&s;ider, that a Creature like Man, who is &s;en&s;ible of &s;o many Weakne&s;&s;es and Imperfecti|ons, &s;hould be actuated by a Love of FAME: That Vice and Igno|rance, Imperfection and Mi&s;ery, &s;hould contend for Prai&s;e, and endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to make them&s;elves Objects of Admiration.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding Man's E&s;&s;ential Perfection is but very little, his Com|parative Perfection may be very con&s;i|derable. If he looks upon him&s;elf in an ab&s;tracted Light, he has not much to
<PB N="80" REF="86">
boa&s;t of; but if he con&s;iders him&s;elf with Regard to others, he may find Oc|ca&s;ion of glorying, if not in his own Virtues, at lea&s;t in the Ab&s;ence of ano|ther's Imperfections. This gives a diffe|rent Turn to the Reflections of the wi&s;e Man and the Fool. The fir&s;t endeavours to &s;hine in him&s;elf, and the la&s;t to out|&s;hine others. The fir&s;t is humbled by the Sen&s;e of his own Infirmities, the la&s;t is lifted up by the Di&s;covery of tho&s;e which he ob&s;erves in other Men. The wi&s;e Man con&s;iders what he wants, and the Fool what he abounds in. The wi&s;e Man is happy when he gains his own Approbation, and the Fool when he recommends him&s;elf to the Applau&s;e of tho&s;e about him.</P>
<P>But however unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd this Pa&s;&s;ion for Admiration may appear in &s;uch a Creature as Man, it is not wholly to be di&s;couraged, &s;ince it often produces very good Effects, not only as it re&s;trains him from doing any Thing which is mean and contemptible, but as it pu&s;hes him to Actions which are great and glorious. The Principle may be de|fective, or faulty, but the Con&s;equences it produces are &s;o good, that, for the Benefit of Mankind, it ought not to be extingui&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>A CHECK to INORDINATE DESIRES.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is not, in my Opini|on, a Con&s;ideration more ef|fectual to extingui&s;h inordi|nate De&s;ires, in the Soul of Man, than the Notions of <HI>PLATO</HI> and his Followers upon that Subject: They tell us, that every Pa&s;&s;ion which has been contracted by the Soul during her Re&s;idence in the Body, re|mains with her in a &s;eparate State; and that the Soul in the Body, or out of the Body, differs no more than the Man does from him&s;elf when he is in his Hou&s;e, or in open Air. When there|fore the ob&s;cene Pa&s;&s;ions in particular, have once taken Root, and &s;pread them|&s;elves in the Soul, they cleave to her in&s;eparably, and remain in her for ever, after the Body is ca&s;t off and thrown a&s;ide. As an Argument to confirm this their Doctrine, they ob&s;erve, that a lewd Youth, who goes on in a continued Cour&s;e of Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, advances by Degrees into a libidinous old Man; and that the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;urvives in the Mind when it is altogether dead in the Body:
<PB N="82" REF="88">
Nay, that the De&s;ire grows more vio|lent, and (like all other Habits) gathers Strength by Age, at the &s;ame Time that it has no Power of executing its own Purpo&s;es. If, &s;ay they, the Soul is the mo&s;t &s;ubject to the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions at a Time when it has the lea&s;t In&s;tigation from the Body, we may well &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will &s;till retain them when &s;he is entirely di|ve&s;ted of it: The very Sub&s;tance of the Soul is fe&s;tered with them; the Gan|grene is gone too far to be ever cured; the Inflammation will rage to all Eter|nity.</P>
<P>In this therefore (&s;ay the <HI>PLATO|NISTS</HI>) con&s;i&s;ts the Puni&s;hment of a voluptuous Man after Death: He is tormented with De&s;ires which it is impo&s;|&s;ible for him to gratify; &s;olicited by a Pa&s;&s;ion that has neither Objects nor Or|gans adapted to it: He lives in a State of invincible De&s;ire and Impotence, and always burns in the Pur&s;uit of what he always de&s;pairs to po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is for this Rea&s;on (&s;ays <HI>PLATO</HI>) that the Souls of the Dead appear frequently in Coe|miteries, and hover about the Places where their Bodies are buried, as &s;till hankering after their old brutal Plea|&s;ures, and de&s;iring again to enter the Body that gave them an Opportunity of fulfilling them.</P>

<HEAD>Upon the IMMORTALITY of the SOUL.</HEAD>
<P>_I Am now led into a Subject upon which I always meditate with great Delight, I mean the IMMORTALITY of the SOUL. When I run over in my Mind the &s;everal Arguments that e&s;tabli&s;h'd this great Point, which is the Ba&s;is of Morality, and the Source of all the plea&s;ing Hopes and &s;ecret Joys that can ari&s;e in the Heart of a rea&s;onable Crea|ture, I con&s;ider tho&s;e &s;everal Proofs drawn,</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> From the Nature of the SOUL it&s;elf, and particularly its Immateriali|ty; which, though not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Eternity of its Duration, has, I think, been evinced to almo&s;t a Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> From its Pa&s;&s;ions and Sentiments, as particularly from its Love of Exi&s;tence, its Horrour of An|nihilation, and its Hopes of Immortali|ty, with that &s;ecret Satisfaction which it finds in the Practice of Virtue, and that Unea&s;ine&s;s which follows in it up|on the Commi&s;&s;ion of Vice.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="91"><HI>THIRDLY,</HI> From the Nature of the &s;upream Being, who&s;e Ju&s;tice, Good|ne&s;s, Wi&s;dom and Veracity, are all con|cerned in this great Point.</P>
<P>But among the&s;e and other excellent Arguments for the IMMORTALITY of the SOUL, there is one drawn from the per|petual Progre&s;s of the SOUL to its Per|fection, without a Po&s;&s;ibility of ever ar|riving at it; which is a Hint that I do not remember to have &s;een opened and improved by others who have written on this Subject, though it &s;eems to me to carry a great Weight with it: How can it enter into the Thoughts of Man, that the SOUL, which is capable of &s;uch immen&s;e Perfections, and of receiving new Improvements to all Eternity, &s;hall fall away into nothing, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is created? Are &s;uch Abilities made for no Purpo&s;e? A Brute arrives at a Point of Perfection that he can never pa&s;s; in a few Years he has all the En|dowments he is capable of, and were he to live ten thou&s;and more, would be the &s;ame Thing he is at pre&s;ent. Were a HUMAN SOUL thus at a Stand in her Accompli&s;hments, were her Facul|ties to be full blown, and incapable of farther Enlargements, I could imagine it might fall away in&s;en&s;ibly, and drop
<PB N="86" REF="92">
at once into a State of Annihilation: But can we believe a Thinking Being, that is in a perpetual Progre&s;s of Improvements, and travelling on from Perfection to Per|fection, after having ju&s;t looked Abroad into the Works of its Creator, and made a few Di&s;coveries of his infinite Good|ne&s;s, Wi&s;dom, and Power, mu&s;t peri&s;h at her fir&s;t &s;etting out, and in the very Beginning of her Enquiries?</P>
<P>A Man, con&s;idered in his pre&s;ent State, &s;eems only &s;ent into the World to pro|pagate his Kind. He provides him&s;elf with a Succe&s;&s;or, and immediately quits his Po&s;t to make Room for him.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;haeres</L>
<L>Haeredem alterius, velut unda &s;upervenit undam,</L></Q>
<P>He does not &s;eem born to enjoy Life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not &s;urprizing to con&s;ider in Animals, which are formed for our U&s;e, and can fini&s;h their Bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort Life. The Silk-worm, after having &s;pun her Ta&s;k, lays her Eggs and dies: But a Man can never have taken in his full Mea&s;ure of Knowledge, has not Time to &s;ubdue his Pa&s;&s;ions, to e&s;tabli&s;h his SOUL in Vir|tue, and come up to the Perfection of his Nature, before he is hurried off the Stage. Would an infinitely wi&s;e Being
<PB N="87" REF="93">
make &s;uch glorious Creatures for &s;o mean a Purpo&s;e? Can he delight in the Pro|duction of &s;uch abortive Intelligencies, &s;uch &s;hort-liv'd rea&s;onable Beings? Would he give us Talents that are not to be exerted? Capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that Wi&s;|dom, which &s;hines through all his Works, in the Formation of Man, without look|ing on this World as only a Nur&s;ery for the next, and believing that the &s;everal Generations of rational Creatures, which ri&s;e up and di&s;appear in &s;uch quick Succe&s;&s;ions, are only to receive their fir&s;t Rudiments of Exi&s;tence here, and afterwards to be tran&s;planted into a more friendly Climate, where they &s;pread and flouri&s;h to all Eternity?</P>
<P>There is not, in my Opinion, a more plea&s;ing and triumphant Con&s;ideration in Religion, than this of the perpetual Progre&s;s which the SOUL makes towards the Perfection of its Nature, without ever arriving at a Period in it. To look upon the SOUL as going on from Strength to Strength; to con&s;ider that &s;he is to &s;hine for ever with new Acce&s;&s;ions of Glory, and brighten to all Eternity; that &s;he will be &s;till adding Virtue to Virtue, and Knowledge to Knowledge; carries in it &s;omething wonderfully a|greeable
<PB N="88" REF="94">
to that Ambition which is na|tural to the Mind of Man: Nay, it mu&s;t be a Pro&s;pect plea&s;ing to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his Creation for ever beautifying in his Eyes, and drawing nearer to him, by greater Degrees of Re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Methinks this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, of the Progre&s;s of a finite Spirit to Per|fection, will be &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h all Envy in inferior Natures, and all Contempt in &s;uperior. That Cherubim, which now appears as a God to a HU|MAN SOUL, knows very well that the Period will come about in Eternity, when the HUMAN SOUL &s;hall be as perfect as he him&s;elf now is: Nay, when &s;he &s;hall look down upon that Degree of Per|fection, as much as &s;he now falls &s;hort of it. It is true, the higher Nature &s;till advances, and by that Means pre&s;erves his Di&s;tance and Superiority in the Scale of Being; but he knows how high &s;o|ever the Station is, of which he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, the inferior Nature will at length mount up to it, and &s;hine forth in the &s;ame Degree of Glory.</P>
<P>With what A&s;toni&s;hment and Venera|tion may we look into our own SOULS, when there are &s;uch hidden Stores of Virtue and Knowledge, &s;uch in exhau&s;ted Sources of Perfection? We know not yet
<PB N="89" REF="95">
what we &s;hall be, nor will it ever enter into the Heart of Man to conceive the Glory that will be always in Re&s;erve for him. The SOUL, con&s;idered with its Cre|ator, is like one of tho&s;e Mathematical Lines that may draw nearer to another for all Eternity, without a Po&s;&s;ibility of touching it: And can there be a Thought &s;o tran&s;porting, as to con&s;ider our&s;elves in the&s;e perpetual Approaches to him, who is not only the Standard of Perfection but of Happine&s;s?</P>

<HEAD>The BENEFIT of DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>_I Am very much plea&s;ed with a con&s;olatory Letter of <HI>Pha|laris,</HI> to one who had lo&s;t a Son, who was a young Man of great Merit. The Thought with which he comforts the afflicted Fa|ther, is, to the be&s;t of my Memory, as follows: That he &s;hould con&s;ider Death had &s;et a Kind of Seal upon his Son's Character, and placed him out of the Reach of Vice and Infamy: That while he lived he was &s;till within the Po&s;&s;ibili|ty of falling away from Virtue, and lo&s;ing the Fame of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed. Death only clo&s;es a Man's Repu|tation, and determines it as good or bad.</P>
<P>This, among other Motives, may be one Rea&s;on, why we are naturally aver&s;e to the launching out into a Man's Prai&s;e 'till his Head is laid in the Du&s;t. Whil&s;t he is capable of changing, we may be for|ced to retract our Opinions: He may for|feit the E&s;teem we have conceived of him, and &s;ome Time or other appear to us un|der a different Light from what he does at pre&s;ent. In &s;hort, as the Life of any

<HEAD>CHEARFULNESS preferable to MIRTH.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have always preferred <HI>Chear|fulne&s;s</HI> to <HI>Mirth:</HI> The latter I con&s;ider as an Act, the for|mer as an Habit of the Mind.

<PB N="93" REF="103">
contrary, Chearfulne&s;s, though it does not give the Mind &s;uch an exqui&s;ite Gladne&s;s, prevents us from falling into the Depths of Sorrow. Mirth is like a Fla&s;h of Lightning, that breaks through a Gloom of Clouds, and glitters for a Moment; Chearfulne&s;s keeps up a Kind of Day-light in the Mind, and fills it with a &s;teady and perpetual Serenity.</P>
<P>MEN of au&s;tere Principles look upon Mirth as too wanton and di&s;&s;olute for a State of Probation, and as filled with a certain Triumph and In&s;olence of Heart, that is incon&s;i&s;tent with a Life which is every Moment obnoxious to the great|e&s;t Danger. Writers of this Complexi|on have ob&s;erved, that the Sacred PER|SON, who was the great Pattern of Per|fection, was never &s;een to laugh.</P>
<P>CHEARFULNESS of Mind is not li|able to any of the&s;e Exceptions; it is of a &s;erious and compo&s;ed Nature; it does not throw the Mind into a Condi|tion improper for the pre&s;ent State of Humanity, and is very con&s;picuous in the Characters of tho&s;e who are looked upon as the greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers among the Heathens, as well as among tho&s;e who have been de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed as Saints and holy Men among Chri&s;tians.</P>

<HEAD>Its Effects.</HEAD>
<P>IF we con&s;ider Chearfulne&s;s in three Lights, with Regard to our&s;elves, to tho&s;e we conver&s;e with, and to the great Author of our Being, it will not a little recom|mend it&s;elf on each of the&s;e Accounts. The Man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this excel|lent Frame of Mind, is not only ea&s;y in his Thoughts, but perfect Ma&s;ter of all the Powers and Faculties of his Soul; his Imagination is always clear, and his Judgment undi&s;turbed; his Temper is even and unruffled, whether in Action or in Solitude; he comes with a Reli&s;h to all tho&s;e Goods which Nature has provided for him, ta&s;tes all the Plea|&s;ures of the Creation which are poured about him, and does not feel the full Weight of tho&s;e accidental Evils which may befal him.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in Relation to the Per&s;ons whom he conver&s;es with, it na|turally produces Love and Good-will towards him. A chearful Mind is not only di&s;po&s;ed to be affable and obliging, but rai&s;es the &s;ame good Humour in tho&s;e who come within its Influence. A Man finds him&s;elf well plea&s;ed he does not know why, with the Chear|fulne&s;s
<PB N="95" REF="105">
of his Companion: It is like a &s;udden Sun-&s;hine, that awakens a &s;ecret Delight in the Mind, without her at|tending to it: The Heart rejoices of its own Accord, and naturally flows out into Friend&s;hip and Benevolence towards the Per&s;on who has &s;o kindly an Effect upon it.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider this chearful State of Mind in its third Relation, I cannot but look upon it as a con&s;tant habitual Gratitude to the great Author of Na|ture. An inward Chearfulne&s;s is an implicit Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving to Pro|vidence under all its Di&s;pen&s;ations: It is a Kind of Acquie&s;cence in the State wherein we are placed, and a &s;ecret Ap|probation of the Divine Will in his Conduct towards Man.</P>

<P>THERE are but two Things which can rea&s;onably deprive us of this Chear|fulne&s;s of Heart: The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the Sen&s;e of Guilt. A Man who lives in a State of Vice and Impenitence, can have no Title to that Evenne&s;s and Tranquillity of Mind, which is the Health of the Soul, and the natural Effect of Virtue and Innocence.

<P><HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> by which I mean a Di&s;be|lief of a &s;upreme Being, and con&s;e|quently of a future State, under what|&s;oever Titles it &s;helters it&s;elf, may like|wi&s;e very rea&s;onably deprive a Man of this Chearfulne&s;s of Temper. There is &s;omething &s;o particularly gloomy and offen&s;ive to human Nature in the Pro|&s;pect of Non-Exi&s;tence, that I cannot but wonder, with many excellent Wri|ters, how it is po&s;&s;ible for a Man to out|live the Expectation of it: For my own Part, I think the Being of a God is &s;o little to be doubted, that it is almo&s;t the only Truth we are &s;ure of, and &s;uch a Truth as we meet with in every Ob|ject, in every Occurrence, and in every Thought. If we look into the Characters of this Tribe of Infidels, we generally find they are made up of Pride, Spleen, and Cavil: It is indeed no Wonder that Men who are unea&s;y to them&s;elves, &s;hould be &s;o to the re&s;t of the World; and how is it po&s;&s;ible for a Man to be otherwi&s;e than unea&s;y in him&s;elf, who is in Danger every Moment of lo&s;ing his entire Exi&s;tence, and dropping into No|thing?</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="107">The vicious Man and Athei&s;t have therefore no Pretence to Chearfulne&s;s, and would act very unrea&s;onably, &s;hould they endeavour after it. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble for any one to live in good Humour, and enjoy his pre&s;ent Exi&s;tence, who is apprehen&s;ive either of Torment, or of Annihilation, of being mi&s;erable, or of not being at all.</P>
<P>After having mentioned the&s;e two great Principles, which are de&s;tructive of Chearfulne&s;s in their own Nature, as well as in right Rea&s;on, I cannot think of any other that ought to bani&s;h this happy Temper from a virtuous Mind. Pain and Sickne&s;s, Shame and Reproach, Poverty and old Age, nay, Death it&s;elf, con&s;idering the Shortne&s;s of their Du|ration, and the Advantage we may reap from them, do not de&s;erve the Name of Evils. A good Mind may bear up under them with Fortitude, with Indolence, and with Chearfulne&s;s of Heart: The to&s;&s;ing of a Tempe&s;t does not di&s;com|po&s;e him, which he is &s;ure will bring him to a joyful Harbour. A Man, who u&s;es his be&s;t Endeavours to live accord|ing to the Dictates of Virtue and right Rea&s;on, has two perpetual Sources of Chearfulne&s;s, in the Con&s;ideration of his own Nature, and of that Being on whom he has a Dependance.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="108">If he looks into him&s;elf, he cannot but rejoice in that Exi&s;tence which is &s;o lately be&s;towed upon him, and which, after Millions of Ages, will be &s;till new, and &s;till in its Beginning. How many Self-Congratulations naturally ari&s;e in the Mind, when it reflects on this its Entrance into Eternity, when it takes a View of tho&s;e improveable Faculties, which in a few Years, and even at its fir&s;t &s;etting out, have made &s;o con&s;ider|able a Progre&s;s, and which will be &s;till receiving an Increa&s;e of Perfection, and con&s;equently an Increa&s;e of Happine&s;s.

<P>The &s;econd Source of Chearfulne&s;s to a good Mind, is its Con&s;ideration of that Being on whom we have our Depen|dance, and in whom, though we be|hold him as yet but in the fir&s;t faint Di&s;coveries of his Perfections, we &s;ee every Thing that we can imagine as great, glorious, or amiable; we find our&s;elves every where upheld by his Goodne&s;s, and &s;urrounded with an Im|men&s;ity of Love and Mercy.

<HEAD>The Benefit of CHEARFULNESS, with Regard to the Body, and the Objects that give Ri&s;e to this Chearfulne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;poken of CHEARFULNESS as it is a <HI>moral</HI> Habit of the Mind, and accordingly mentioned &s;uch moral Mo|tives
<PB N="100" REF="110">
as are apt to cheri&s;h and keep alive this happy Temper in the Soul of Man: I &s;hall now con&s;ider <HI>Chearfulne&s;s</HI> in its <HI>natural</HI> State, and reflect on the&s;e Motives to it, which are indifferent either as to Virtue or Vice.</P>
<P>CHEARFULNESS is, in the fir&s;t Place, the be&s;t Promoter of Health. Repinings and &s;ecret Murmurings of the Heart give imperceptible Strokes to tho&s;e de|licate Fibres of which the vital Parts are compo&s;ed, and wear out the Ma|chine in&s;en&s;ibly; not to mention tho&s;e violent Ferments which they &s;tir up in the Blood, and tho&s;e irregular di|&s;turbed Motions which they rai&s;e in the animal Spirits. Health and Chearful|ne&s;s mutually beget each other, with this Difference, that we &s;eldom meet with a great Degree of Health which is not attended with a certain Chearful|ne&s;s, but very often &s;ee <HI>Chearfulne&s;s</HI> where there is no great Degree of Health.</P>
<P>CHEARFULNESS bears the &s;ame friendly Regard to the Mind as to the Body; it bani&s;hes all anxious Care and Di&s;content, &s;ooths and compo&s;es the Pa&s;&s;ions, and keeps the Soul in a perpe|tual Calm. The World in which we are placed, is filled with innumerable
<PB N="101" REF="111">
Objects, that are proper to rai&s;e and keep alive this happy Temper of Mind.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the World in its Sub|&s;erviency to Man, one would think it was made for our U&s;e; but if we con|&s;ider it in its natural Beauty and Har|mony, one would be apt to conclude it was made for our Plea&s;ure. The Sun, which is as the great Soul of the Uni|ver&s;e, and produces all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, has a particular Influence in chearing the Mind of Man, and making the Heart glad.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;everal living Creatures which are made for our Service, or Su&s;tenance, at the &s;ame Time either fill the Woods with their Mu&s;ick, furni&s;h us with Game, or rai&s;e plea&s;ing Ideas in us by the Delightfulne&s;s of their Appearance. Fountains, Lakes, and Rivers are as re|fre&s;hing to the Imagination, as to the Soil through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider farther this double End in the Works of Nature, and how they are at the &s;ame Time both u&s;eful and entertaining, we find, that the mo&s;t im|portant Parts of the vegetable World are tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t beautiful. The&s;e are the Seeds by which the &s;eve|ral Races of Plants are propagated and continued, and which are always lodg'd

in Flowers or Blo&s;&s;oms. Nature &s;eems to hide her principal De&s;ign, and to be indu|&s;trious in making the Earth gay and de|lightful, while &s;he is carrying on her great Work, and intent upon her own Pre&s;ervation. The Hu&s;bandman, after the &s;ame Manner, is employed in lay|ing out the whole Country in a Kind of Garden, or Land&s;kip, and making e|very Thing &s;mile about him, whil&s;t in Reality he thinks of nothing but of the Harve&s;t and Encrea&s;e which is to ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>We may farther ob&s;erve how Provi|dence has taken Care to keep up this Chearfulne&s;s in the Mind of Man, by having formed it after &s;uch a Manner, as to make it capable of conceiving De|light from &s;everal Objects which &s;eem to have very little U&s;e in them, as from the Wildne&s;s of Rocks and De|&s;arts, and the like grote&s;que Pieces of Nature. Tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in Phi|lo&s;ophy, may &s;till carry this Con&s;idera|tion higher, by ob&s;erving, that if Mat|ter had appeared to us endowed only with tho&s;e real Qualities which it actu|ally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it would have made but a very joyle&s;s and uncomfortable Fi|gure; and why has Providence given it a Power of producing in us &s;uch ima|ginary

Qualities, as Ta&s;tes and Colours, Sounds and Smells, Heat and Cold, but that Man, while he is conver&s;ant in the lower Stations of Nature, might have his Mind cheared and delighted with agreeable Sen&s;ations? In &s;hort, the whole Univer&s;e is a Kind of Theatre, filled with Objects that either rai&s;e in us Plea&s;ure, Amu&s;ement, or Admiration.</P>

<P>I &s;hall not here mention the &s;everal Entertainments of Art, with the Plea|&s;ures of Friend&s;hip, Books, Conver&s;a|tion, and other accidental Diver&s;ions of Life, becau&s;e I would only take Notice of &s;uch Incitements to a chearful Tem|per, as offer them&s;elves to Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Conditions, and which may &s;ufficiently &s;hew us that Providence did not de&s;ign this World &s;hould be fill'd with Murmurs and Repinings, or that the Heart of Man &s;hould be in|volv'd in Gloom or Melancholy.</P>

<P>I would therefore propo&s;e the fol|lowing Methods to the Con&s;ideration of &s;uch as would find out their &s;ecret Faults, and make a true E&s;timate of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, let them con&s;ider well what are the Characters which they bear among their Enemies. Our Friends very often flatter us, as much as our own Hearts. They either do not &s;ee our Faults, or conceal them from us, or &s;often them by their Re|pre&s;entations, after &s;uch a Manner, that we think them too trivial to be taken Notice of. An Adver&s;ary, on the con|trary, makes a &s;tricter Search into us, di&s;covers every Flaw and Imperfection in our Tempers, and though his Malice may &s;et them in too &s;trong a Light, it has generally &s;ome Ground for what it advances. A Friend exaggerates a Man's Virtues, an Enemy inflames his Crimes. A wi&s;e Man &s;hould give a

ju&s;t Attention to both of them, &s;o far as they may tend to the Improvement of the one, and Diminution of the other.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> has written an E&s;&s;ay on the Benefits which a Man may receive from his Enemies, and, among the good Fruits of Enmity, mentions this in particular, that by the Reproaches which it ca&s;ts upon us, we &s;ee the wor&s;t Side of our &s;elves, and open our Eyes to &s;everal Blemi&s;hes and Defects in our Lives and Conver&s;ations, which we &s;hould not have ob&s;erv'd, without the Help of &s;uch ill-natur'd Monitors.</P>
<P>In order likewi&s;e to come at a true Knowledge of our &s;elves, we &s;hould con&s;ider on the other hand how far we may de&s;erve the Prai&s;es and Approba|tions which the World be&s;tow upon us; whether the Actions they celebrate, proceed from laudable and worthy Mo|tives, and how far we are really po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e Virtues which gain us an Applau&s;e among tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;e. Such a Reflection is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, if we con&s;ider how apt we are either to value or condemn our&s;elves by the Opinions of others, and to &s;acrifice the Report of our own Hearts to the Judgment of the World.</P>

<P>It is our Comfort, while we are ob|noxious to &s;o many Accidents, that we are under the Care of one who directs Contingencies, and has in his Hands the Management of every Thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows the A&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;tand in Need of, and is always ready to be&s;tow it on tho&s;e who a&s;k it of him.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="128">The natural Homage which &s;uch a Creature bears to &s;o infinitely Wi&s;e and Good a Being, is a firm Reliance on him for the Ble&s;&s;ings and Conveniencies of Life, and an habitual Tru&s;t in him for Deliverance out of all &s;uch Dangers and Difficulties as may befal us.</P>
<P>The Man, who always lives in this Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind, has not the &s;ame dark and melancholy Views of Human Nature, as he who con&s;iders him&s;elf ab&s;tractedly from this Relation to the Supreme Being.

<P><PB N="119" REF="129">To make our Lives more ea&s;y to us, we are commanded to put our Tru&s;t in Him, who is thus able to relieve and &s;uccour us; the Divine Goodne&s;s ha|ving made &s;uch a Reliance a Duty, not|with&s;tanding we &s;hould have been mi|&s;erable had it been forbidden us.</P>

A Per&s;on who believes he has his Succour at Hand, and that acts in the Sight of his Friend, often exerts him&s;elf beyond his Abili|ties, and does Wonders that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with &s;uch a Confidence of Succe&s;s.

<HEAD>The Force and Effect of CUSTOM.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is not a common Saying which has a better Turn of Sen&s;e to it, than what we often hear in the Mouths of the Vulgar, that CUSTOM <HI>is a &s;econd Nature.</HI> It is indeed able to form the Man anew, and to give him Inclinations and Capacities altogether different from tho&s;e he was born with. CUSTOM has a Mechanical Effect upon the Body, at the &s;ame Time that it has a very extraordinary Influ|ence upon the Mind.</P>
<P>CUSTOM has a wonderful Efficacy in making every Thing plea&s;ant to us; our Delight in any particular Study, Art, or Science, ri&s;es and improves in Proportion to the Application which we be&s;tow upon it; what was at fir&s;t an Exerci&s;e, becomes at length an En|tertainment. Our Employments are changed into our Diver&s;ions. The Mind grows fond of tho&s;e Actions &s;he is accu&s;tomed to, and is dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">wn with Reluctancy from tho&s;e Paths in which &s;he has been u&s;ed to walk. Not only
<PB N="122" REF="132">
&s;uch Actions as were at fir&s;t indifferent to us, but even &s;uch as were painful, will by Cu&s;tom and Practice become plea&s;ant.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Advantages that may be derived from this Effect of CUSTOM.</HEAD>
<P>If we con&s;ider attentively this Pro|perty of human Nature, it may in&s;truct us in very fine Moralities. In the fir&s;t Place, I would have no Man di&s;cou|raged with that Kind of Life, or Series of Action, in which the Choice of o|thers, or his own Nece&s;&s;ities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very di&s;agreeable to him at fir&s;t; but U&s;e and Application will certainly render it not only le&s;s painful, but plea&s;ing and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Place, I would recom|mend to every one that admirable Pre|cept which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> is &s;aid to have given his Di&s;ciples, and which that Philo&s;opher mu&s;t have drawn from the Ob&s;ervation I have enlarged upon; <Q REND="inline"><HI>Op|timum vitae genus eligito, nam con&s;uetudo faciet jucundi&s;&s;imum,</HI></Q> Pitch upon that Cour&s;e of Life which is the mo&s;t ex|cellent, and Cu&s;tom will render it the mo&s;t delightful. Men, who&s;e Circum|&s;tances
<PB N="123" REF="133">
will permit them to chu&s;e their own Way of Life, are inexcu&s;able if they do not pur&s;ue that which their Judgment tells them is the mo&s;t lau|dable. The Voice of Rea&s;on is more to be regarded than the Bent of any pre&s;ent Inclination, &s;ince by the Rule above-mentioned, Inclination will at length come over to Rea&s;on, though we can never force Rea&s;on to comply with Inclination.</P>
<P>In the third Place, this Ob&s;ervation may teach the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and irreli|gious Man, to overlook tho&s;e Hard&s;hips and Difficulties which are apt to di&s;|courage him from the Pro&s;ecution of a virtuous Life. <Q REND="inline"><HI>The Gods,</HI> &s;aid <HI>He&s;iod, have placed Labour before Virtue; the Way to her is at fir&s;t rough and difficult, but grows more &s;mooth and ea&s;y the far|ther you advance in it.</HI></Q> The Man who proceeds in it with Steadine&s;s and Re|&s;olution, will find, that <Q REND="inline"><HI>her Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and that all her Paths are Peace.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To enforce this Con&s;ideration, we may farther ob&s;erve, that the Practice of Religion will not only be attended with that Plea&s;ure which naturally ac|companies tho&s;e Actions to which we are habituated, but with tho&s;e &s;uper|numerary
<PB N="124" REF="134">
Joys of Heart, that ri&s;e from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a Plea&s;ure, from the Satisfaction of acting up to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, and from the Pro&s;pect of an happy Immortality.</P>
<P>In the fourth Place, we may learn from this Ob&s;ervation which we have made on the Mind of Man, to take par|ticular Care, when we are once &s;ettled in a regular Cour&s;e of Life, how we too frequently indulge our &s;elves in any the mo&s;t indecent Diver&s;ions and Entertainments, &s;ince the Mind may in&s;en&s;ibly fall off from the Reli&s;h of virtuous Actions, and, by degrees, ex|change that Plea&s;ure which it takes in the Performance of its Duty, for De|lights of a much more inferior and un|profitable Nature.</P>
<P>The la&s;t U&s;e which I &s;hall make of this remarkable Property in human Na|ture, of being delighted with tho&s;e Actions to which it is accu&s;tomed, is to &s;hew how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is for us to gain Habits of Virtue in this Life, if we would enjoy the Plea&s;ures of the next. The State of Bli&s;s we call Hea|ven, will not be capable of affecting tho&s;e Minds which are not thus qua|lified for it; we mu&s;t, in this World, gain a Reli&s;h of Truth and Virtue, if
<PB N="125" REF="135">
we would be able to ta&s;te that Know|ledge and Perfection, which are to make us happy in the next. The Seeds of tho&s;e Spiritual Joys and Raptures, which are to ri&s;e up and flouri&s;h in the Soul to all Eternity, mu&s;t be planted in her during this her pre&s;ent State of Proba|tion: In &s;hort, Heaven is not to be looked upon only as the Reward, but as the natural Effect of a religious Life. On the other Hand, tho&s;e evil Spirits, who, by long Cu&s;tom, have contracted in the Body Habits of Lu&s;t and Sen&s;ua|lity, Malice and Revenge, an Aver&s;ion to every Thing that is good, ju&s;t, or laudable, are naturally &s;ea&s;oned and prepared for Pain and Mi&s;ery. Their Torments have already taken Root in them; they cannot be happy when dive&s;ted of the Body, unle&s;s we may &s;uppo&s;e that Providence will, in a Man|ner, create them a-new, and work a Miracle in the Rectification of their Fa|culties. They may, indeed, ta&s;te a Kind of malignant Plea&s;ure in tho&s;e Actions to which they are accu&s;tomed, whil&s;t in this Life, but when they are removed from all tho&s;e Objects which are here apt to gratify them, they will naturally become their own Tormen|tors, and cheri&s;h in them&s;elves tho&s;e

<P>_THERE is not a more plea|&s;ing Exerci&s;e of the Mind than GRATITUDE. It is accompanied with &s;uch an inward Satisfaction, that the Duty is &s;ufficiently rewarded by the Performance. It is not like the Practice of many other Virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with &s;o much Plea&s;ure, that were there no po&s;itive Command which enjoin'd it, nor any Recompence laid up for it hereafter, a generous Mind would indulge it&s;elf in it, for the natural Gratification that accompanies it.</P>
<P>If GRATITUDE is due from Man to Man, how much more from Man to his Maker? The &s;upreme Being does not only confer upon us tho&s;e Bounties which proceed more immediately from his Hand, but even tho&s;e Benefits which are convey'd to us by others. Every

Ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy, by what Means &s;oe|ver it may be derived upon us, is the Gift of him who is the great Author of Good, and Father of Mercies.</P>
<P>If GRATITUDE, towards one ano|ther, naturally produces a very plea|&s;ing Sen&s;ation in the Mind of a grate|ful Man; it exalts the Soul into Rap|ture, when it is employed on this great Object of <HI>Gratitude,</HI> on this Beneficent Being, who has given us every Thing we already po&s;&s;e&s;s, and from whom we expect every Thing we yet hope for.</P>

<P>_NOthing is more amiable than true MODESTY, and no|thing is more contemptible than the fal&s;e: The one guards Virtue, the other betrays it. True MODESTY is a&s;hamed to do any Thing that is repugnant to the Rules of right Rea&s;on: Fal&s;e MO|DESTY is a&s;hamed to do any Thing that is oppo&s;ite to the Humour of the Company. True <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> avoids every Thing that is criminal, fal&s;e <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> every Thing that is unfa&s;hionable. The

latter is only a general undetermined In&s;tinct; the former is that In&s;tinct li|mited and circum&s;cribed by the Rules of Prudence and Religion. We may conclude that Mode&s;ty to be fal&s;e and vicious, which engages a Man to do any Thing that is ill or indi&s;creet, or which re&s;trains him from doing any Thing that is of a contrary Nature.</P>
<P>Nor does this fal&s;e <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> expo&s;e us only to &s;uch Actions as are indi&s;|creet, but very often to &s;uch as are highly Criminal. When <HI>Xenophanes</HI> was called timorous, becau&s;e he would not venture his Money in a Game at Dice; <Q REND="inline"><HI>I confe&s;s,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that I am ex|ceeding timorous, for I dare not do an ill Thing.</HI></Q> On the contrary, a Man of vi|cious <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> complies with every Thing, and is only fearful of doing what may look &s;ingular in the Company where he is engaged. He falls in with the Torrent, and lets him&s;elf go to every Action or Di&s;cour&s;e, however unju&s;tifi|able in its &s;elf, &s;o it be in vogue among the pre&s;ent Party.

<P>In the &s;econd Place we are to con&s;i|der fal&s;e <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> as it re&s;trains a Man from doing what is good and laudable; and here I &s;hall only dwell upon one Reflection, which I cannot make with|out a &s;ecret Concern.

Our Exce&s;s of <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> makes us &s;hame-faced in all the Exerci&s;es of Piety and Devotion. This Humour prevails upon us daily; in&s;omuch, that at many well-bred Tables, the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e is &s;o very mode&s;t a Man, that he has not the Confidence to &s;ay Grace at his own Table: A Cu&s;tom which is not only practi&s;ed by all the Nations about us, but was never omit|ted by the Heathens them&s;elves. <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who travel into <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Countries, are not a little &s;urprized to meet with People of the be&s;t Quality kneeling in their Churches,

By tho&s;e Things which we are to believe, I mean whatever is revealed to us in the Holy Writings, and which we could not have obtained the Knowledge of by the Light of Nature; by the Things which we are to practice, I mean all tho&s;e Duties to which we are directed by Rea&s;on or natural Religion. The fir&s;t of the&s;e I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the Name of FAITH, the &s;econd by that of MORA|LITY. If we look into the more &s;eri|ous Part of Mankind, we find many
<PB N="134" REF="144">
who lay &s;o great a Stre&s;s upon FAITH, that they neglect MORALITY; and many who build &s;o much upon <HI>Mora|lity,</HI> that they do not pay a due Regard to <HI>Faith.</HI> The perfect Man &s;hould be defective in neither of the&s;e Particulars, as will be very evident to tho&s;e who con&s;ider the Benefits which ari&s;e from each of them, and which I &s;hall make my pre&s;ent Subject.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this general Divi|&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Duty into <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> and that they have both their peculiar Excellencies, the fir&s;t has the Pre-eminence in &s;everal Re&s;pects.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Morality</HI> (as I have &s;tated the Notion of it) is of a fixt eternal Nature, and will endure when <HI>Faith</HI> &s;hall fail, and be lo&s;t in Conviction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e a Per&s;on may be qualified to do greater Good to Man|kind, and become more beneficial to the World, by <HI>Morality,</HI> without <HI>Faith,</HI> than by <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Morality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e <HI>Morality</HI> gives a great|er Perfection to human Nature, by quieting the Mind, moderating the Pa&s;&s;ions, and advancing the Happine&s;s of every Man in his private Capa|city.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="145"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Becau&s;e the Rule of <HI>Mora|lity</HI> is much more certain than that of <HI>Faith,</HI> all the civilized Nations agree|ing in the great Points of <HI>Morality,</HI> as much as they differ in tho&s;e of <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Becau&s;e Infidelity is not of &s;o malignant a Nature as Immorality; or, to put the &s;ame Rea&s;on in another Light, becau&s;e it is generally owned, there may be Salvation for a virtuous Infidel, (particularly in the Ca&s;e of in|vincible Ignorance) but none for a vi|cious Believer.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Becau&s;e Infidelity &s;eems to draw its Principal, if not all its Excel|lency, from the Influence it has upon <HI>Morality</HI>; as we &s;hall &s;ee more at large, if we con&s;ider wherein con&s;i&s;ts the Ex|cellency of <HI>Faith,</HI> or the Belief of Re|vealed Religion; and this I think is,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In explaining, and carrying to greater Heights, &s;everal Points of <HI>Mo|rality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In furni&s;hing new and &s;tron|ger Motives to enforce the Practice of <HI>Morality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In giving us more amiable Ideas of the &s;upreme Being, more en|dearing Notions of one another, and a truer State of our &s;elves, both in Regard to the Grandeur and Vilene&s;s of our Natures.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="146"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> By &s;hewing us the Blackne&s;s and Deformity of Vice, which in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem is &s;o very great, that he who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all Perfection, and the Sovereign Judge of it, is repre|&s;ented by &s;everal of our Divines as ha|ting Sin to the &s;ame Degree that he loves the &s;acred Per&s;on who was made the Propitiation of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> In being the ordinary and pre&s;cribed Method of making <HI>Morality</HI> effectual to Salvation.</P>
<P>This I am &s;ure is &s;o obvious, that no one can mi&s;s it, namely, that a Man cannot be perfect in his Scheme of <HI>Mo|rality,</HI> who does not &s;trengthen and &s;up|port it with that of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, I &s;hall lay down two or three other Maxims, which I think we may deduce from what has been &s;aid:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That we &s;hould be particularly cautious of making any Thing an Ar|ticle of <HI>Faith,</HI> which does not contri|bute to the Confirmation or Improve|ment of <HI>Morality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That no Article of <HI>Faith</HI> can be true and authentick, which weakens or &s;ubverts the practical Part of Religion, or what I have hitherto called <HI>Morality.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="147"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the greate&s;t Friend of <HI>Morality,</HI> or Natural Religion, cannot po&s;&s;ibly apprehend any Danger from embracing Chri&s;tianity, as it is pre&s;er|ved pure and uncorrupt in the Doctrines of our National Church.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another Maxim which I think may be drawn from the foregoing Con&s;iderations, which is this, that we &s;hould in all dubious Points con&s;ider any ill Con&s;equences that may ari&s;e from them, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould be erroneous, before we give up our A&s;&s;ent to them.</P>

<HEAD>The Immorality of PERSECUTION.</HEAD>
<P>_FOR Example, in that di&s;pu|table Point of per&s;ecuting Men for Con&s;cience &s;ake, be|&s;ides the imbittering their Minds with Hatred, Indig|nation, and all the Vehemence of Re|&s;entment, and en&s;naring them to pro|fe&s;s what they do not believe; we cut them off from the Plea&s;ures and Advan|tages of Society, afflict their Bodies, di|&s;tre&s;s their Fortunes, hurt their Repu|tations, ruin their Families, make their

<P>In this Ca&s;e the Injury done our Neighbour is plain and evident; the Principle that puts us upon doing it, of a dubious and di&s;putable Nature. Morality &s;eems highly violated by the one, and whether or no a Zeal for what a Man thinks the true Sy&s;tem of Faith may ju&s;tify it, is very uncertain. I cannot but think, if our Religion pro|duces Charity as well as Zeal, it will not be for &s;hewing it&s;elf by &s;uch cruel In&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>The Middle Condition of Life mo&s;t de&s;irable.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is a beautiful Saying in <HI>Theognis,</HI> <Q REND="inline"><HI>Vice is covered by Wealth, and Virtue by Po|verty</HI>; or, to give it in the verbal Tran&s;lation, <HI>Among Men there are &s;ome who have their Vices</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="149"><HI>concealed by Wealth, and others who have their Virtues concealed by Poverty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Every Man's Ob&s;ervation will &s;upply him with In&s;tances of rich Men, who have &s;everal Faults and Defects that are overlooked, if not entirely hidden, by means of their Riches; and I think we cannot find a more natural De&s;cription of a poor Man, who&s;e Merits are lo&s;t in his Poverty, than that in the Words of the Wi&s;e Man: <Q REND="inline"><HI>There was a little City, and few Men within it; and there came a great King again&s;t it, and be&s;ieged it, and built great Bulwarks again&s;t it: Now there was found in it a poor wi&s;e Man, and he by his Wi&s;dom deliver'd the City; yet no Man remembered that &s;ame poor Man. Then &s;aid I, Wi&s;dom is better than Strength; neverthele&s;s, the poor Man's Wi&s;dom is de|&s;pi&s;ed, and his Words are not heard.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The middle Condition &s;eems to be the mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for the gaining of Wi&s;dom. Poverty turns our Thoughts too much upon the &s;upplying of our Wants, and Riches upon enjoy|ing our Superfluities; and as <HI>Cowley</HI> has &s;aid in another Ca&s;e, <Q REND="inline"><HI>it is hard for a Man to keep a &s;teady Eye upon Truth, who is always in a Battle or a Triumph.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="150">If we regard Poverty and Wealth, as they are apt to produce Virtues or Vi|ces in the Mind of Man, one may ob|&s;erve that there is a Set of each of the&s;e growing out of Poverty, quite different from that which ri&s;es out of Wealth. Humility and Patience, Indu&s;try and Temperance, are very often the good Qualities of a poor Man. Humanity and good Nature, Magnanimity, and a Sen&s;e of Honour, are as often the Qua|lifications of the Rich. On the contra|ry, Poverty is apt to betray a Man into Envy, Riches into Arrogance. Poverty is too often attended with Fraud, vici|ous Compliance, repining Murmurs, and Di&s;content. Riches expo&s;e a Man to Pride and Luxury, a fooli&s;h Elation of Heart, and too great a Fondne&s;s for the pre&s;ent World. In &s;hort, the mid|dle Condition is mo&s;t eligible to the Man who would improve him&s;elf in Virtue; as I have before &s;hewn, it is the mo&s;t advantageous for the gaining of Know|ledge.</P>

<HEAD>The Means for confirming our FAITH.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING <HI>already</HI> endea|voured to &s;hew the great Excellency of FAITH, I &s;hall here con&s;ider what are the proper Means of &s;trength|ening and confirming it in the Mind of Man. Tho&s;e who delight in reading Books of Controver&s;y, which are writ|ten on both Sides of the Que&s;tion in Points of Faith, do very &s;eldom arrive at a fixed and &s;ettled Habit of it. They are one Day entirely convinced of its important Truths, and the next meet with &s;omething that &s;hakes and di&s;turbs them. The Doubt which was laid re|vives again, and &s;hews it &s;elf in new Difficulties, and that generally for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Mind, which is perpetually lo&s;t in Controver&s;ies and Di&s;putes, is apt to forget the Rea&s;ons which had once &s;et it at Re&s;t, and to be di&s;quieted with any former Perplexity, when it appears in a new Shape, or is &s;tarted by a different Hand. As nothing is more laudable than an Enquiry after Truth, &s;o nothing is more irrational
<PB N="142" REF="152">
than to pa&s;s away our whole Lives, without determining our &s;elves one Way or other in tho&s;e Points, which are of the la&s;t Importance to us. There are indeed many Things from which we may with-hold our A&s;&s;ent; but in Ca|&s;es by which we are to regulate our Lives, it is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity to be wavering and un&s;ettled, without clo&s;ing with that Side which appears the mo&s;t &s;afe and the mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Rule therefore which I &s;hall lay down is this, That when by Read|ing or Di&s;cour&s;e we find our&s;elves tho|roughly convinced of the Truth of any Article, and of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of our Belief in it, we &s;hould never after &s;uffer our &s;elves to call it into Que&s;tion. We may perhaps forget the Arguments which occa&s;ioned our Conviction; but we ought to remember the Strength they had with us, and therefore &s;till to re|tain the Conviction which they once produced. This is no more than what we do in every common Art or Science, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to act otherwi&s;e, con&s;i|dering the Weakne&s;s and Limitation of our intellectual Faculties. It is in this Manner that the Mathematician pro|ceeds upon Propo&s;itions which he has once demon&s;trated, and though the De|mon&s;tration
<PB N="143" REF="153">
may have &s;lipt out of his Memory, he builds upon the Truth, becau&s;e he knows it was demon&s;trated. This Rule is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for weaker Minds, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure for Men of the greate&s;t Abilities; but to the&s;e la&s;t I would propo&s;e, in the &s;econd Place, that they &s;hould lay up in their Memories, and always keep by them in a Readine&s;s, tho&s;e Arguments which ap|pear to them of the greate&s;t Strength, and which cannot be got over by all the Doubts and Cavils of Infidelity. But, in the third Place, there is nothing which &s;trengthens Faith more than Mo|rality. Faith and Morality naturally produce each other. A Man is quickly convinced of the Truth of Religion, who finds it is not again&s;t his Intere&s;t that it &s;hould be true. The Plea&s;ure he receives at pre&s;ent, and the Happine&s;s which he promi&s;es him&s;elf to receive from it hereafter, will both di&s;pose him very powerfully to give Credit to it, ac|cording to the ordinary Ob&s;ervation, that <HI>we are ea&s;y to believe what we wi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It is very certain, that a Man of &s;ound Rea&s;on cannot forbear clo&s;ing with Re|ligion upon an impartial Examination of it; but at the &s;ame Time it is as cer|tain, that Faith is kept alive in us, and
<PB N="144" REF="154">
gathers Strength from Practice more than from Speculation.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another Method, which is more per&s;ua&s;ive than any of the for|mer, and that is an habitual Adoration of the &s;upreme Being, as well in con|&s;tant Acts of mental Wor&s;hip, as in out|ward Forms. The devout Man does not only believe but feels there is a Deity: He has actual Sen&s;ations of him; his Experience concurs with his Rea&s;on; he &s;ees him more and more in all his Inter|cour&s;es with him, and even in this Life almo&s;t lo&s;es his Faith in Conviction.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Method which I &s;hall menti|on for the giving Life to a Man's Faith, is frequent Retirement from the World, accompany'd with religious Meditation. When a Man thinks of any Thing in the Darkne&s;s of the Night, whatever deep Impre&s;&s;ions it may make in his Mind are apt to bani&s;h as &s;oon as the Day breaks about him. The Light and Noi&s;e of the Day, which are perpetually solicit|ing his Sen&s;es, and calling off his Atten|tion, wear out of his Mind the Thoughts that imprinted them&s;elves in it, with &s;o much Strength, during the Silence and Darkne&s;s of the Night. A Man finds the &s;ame Difference as to him&s;elf in a Crowd and a Solitude; the Mind is &s;tun|ned
<PB N="145" REF="155">
and dazzled amid&s;t that Variety of Objects which pre&s;&s;es upon her in a great City: She cannot apply her&s;elf to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Things which are of the utmo&s;t Concern to her. The Cares or Plea&s;ures of the World &s;trike in with every Thought, and a multi|tude of vicious Examples give a kind of Ju&s;tification to our Folly. In our Re|tirements every Thing di&s;po&s;es us to be &s;erious. In Courts and Cities we are entertained with the Works of Men, in the Country with tho&s;e of God. One is the Province of Art, the other of Na|ture. Faith and Devotion naturally grow in the Mind of every rea&s;onable Man, who &s;ees the Impre&s;&s;ions of divine Power and Wi&s;dom in every Object on which he ca&s;ts his Eye. The &s;upreme Being has made the be&s;t Arguments for his own Exi&s;tence, in the Formation of the Heavens and the Earth; and the&s;e are Arguments which a Man of Sen&s;e cannot forbear attending to, who is out of the Noi&s;e and Hurry of human Af|fairs. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, That &s;hould a Man live under Ground, and there conver&s;e with Works of Art and Mechani&s;m, and &s;hould afterwards be brought up into the open Day, and &s;ee the &s;everal Glories of the Heaven and Earth, he would imme|diately

<HEAD>Places of Tru&s;t be&s;t inve&s;ted in Men of ge|nerous Principles.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM per&s;uaded there are few Men, of generous Prin|ciples, who would &s;eek af|ter great Places, were it not rather to have an Opportu|nity in their Hands of obliging their particular Friends, or tho&s;e whom they look upon as Men of Worth, than to procure Wealth and Honour for them|&s;elves. To an hone&s;t Mind the be&s;t Perqui&s;ites of a Place are the Advanta|ges it gives a Man of doing Good. Tho&s;e who are under the great Officers of State, and are the In&s;truments by which they act, have more frequent Opportu|nities for the Exerci&s;e of Compa&s;&s;ion and Benevolence, than their Superiors them&s;elves. The&s;e Men know every little Ca&s;e that is to come before the Great Man, and if they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with hone&s;t Minds, will con&s;ider Pover|ty as a Recommendation in the Per&s;on who applies him&s;elf to them, and make
<PB N="147" REF="157">
the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e the mo&s;t power|ful Solicitor in his Behalf. A Man of this Temper, when he is in a Po&s;t of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, becomes a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Publick: He patronizes the Orphan and the Wi|dow, a&s;&s;i&s;ts the Friendle&s;s, and guides the Ignorant: He does not reject the Per&s;on's Preten&s;ions, who does not know how to explain them, or refu&s;e doing a good Office for a Man becau&s;e he cannot pay the Fee of it. In &s;hort, tho' he regulates him&s;elf in all his Pro|ceedings by Ju&s;tice and Equity, he finds a thou&s;and Occa&s;ions for all the good-natured Offices of Genero&s;ity and Com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Man is unfit for &s;uch a Place of Tru&s;t, who is of a &s;ower untractable Nature, or has any other Pa&s;&s;ion that makes him unea&s;y to tho&s;e who ap|proach him. Roughne&s;s of Temper is apt to di&s;countenance the Timorous or Mode&s;t. The proud Man di&s;courages tho&s;e from approaching him who are of a mean Condition, and who mo&s;t want his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The impudent Man will not give him&s;elf Time to be informed of the Matter that lies before him. An Officer with one or more of the&s;e unbe|coming Qualities, is &s;ometimes looked upon as a proper Per&s;on to keep off Im|pertinence
<PB N="148" REF="158">
and Solicitation from his Su|perior; but this is a kind of Merit that can never atone for the Inju&s;tice which may very often ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>There are two other vicious Quali|ties which render a Man very unfit for &s;uch a Place of Tru&s;t. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a dilatory Temper, which com|mits innumerable Cruelties without De|&s;ign. The Maxim which &s;everal have laid down for a Man's Conduct in ordi|nary Life, &s;hould be inviolable with a Man in Office, never to think of doing that to Morrow which may be done to Day. A Man who defers doing what ought to done, is guilty of Inju&s;tice &s;o long as he defers it. The Di&s;patch of a good Of|fice is very often as beneficial to the So|licitor as the good Office it&s;elf. In &s;hort, if a Man compared the Inconveniencies which another &s;uffers by his Delays, with the trifling Motives and Advanta|ges which he him&s;elf may reap by &s;uch a Delay, he would never be guilty of a Fault which very often does an irrepa|rable Prejudice to the Per&s;on who de|pends upon him, and which might be remedyed with little Trouble to him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But in the la&s;t Place, there is no Man &s;o improper to be employ'd in Bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="149" REF="159">
as he who is in any degree capable of Corruption; and &s;uch a one is the Man, who upon any Pretence what&s;oever re|ceives more than what is the &s;tated and unque&s;tioned Fee of his Office. Grati|fications, Tokens of Thankfulne&s;s, Di&s;|patch-Money, and the like &s;pecious Terms, are the Pretences under which Corruption very frequently &s;helters it &s;elf. An hone&s;t Man will however look on all the&s;e Methods as unju&s;tifiable, and will enjoy him&s;elf better in a mode|rate Fortune that is gained with Ho|nour and Reputation, than in an over-grown E&s;tate that is cankered with the Acqui&s;itions of Rapine and Extortion. Were all our Offices di&s;charged with &s;uch an inflexible Integrity, we &s;hould not &s;ee Men in all Ages, who grow up to exorbitant Wealth, with the Abilities which are to be met with in an ordinary Mechanick.

<HEAD>Why Men of Learning are be&s;t qualifyed for &s;uch Offices.</HEAD>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that Men of Learning, who take to Bu&s;ine&s;s, di&s;|charge it generally with greater Hone|&s;ty than Men of the World. The chief Rea&s;on for it I take to be as follows. A Man that has &s;pent his Youth in Read|ing, has been u&s;ed to find Virtue extol|led, and Vice &s;tigmatized: A Man that has pa&s;t his Time in the World, has of|ten &s;een Vice triumphant, and Virtue di&s;countenanced. Extortion, Rapine, and Inju&s;tice, which are branded with Infamy in Books, often give a Man a Figure in the World; while &s;everal Qualities which are celebrated in Au|thors, as Genero&s;ity, Ingenuity, and Good-nature, impoveri&s;h and ruin him. This cannot but have a proportionable Effect on Men who&s;e Tempers and Principles are equally good and vicious.</P>
<P>There would be at lea&s;t this Advan|tage in employing Men of Learning and Parts in Bu&s;ine&s;s, that their Pro&s;pe|rity would &s;et more gracefully on them, and that we &s;hould not &s;ee many worth|le&s;s Per&s;ons &s;hot up into the greate&s;t Fi|gures of Life.</P>

<P>_OUR actual Enjoyments are &s;o few and tran&s;ient, that Man would be a very mi|&s;erable Being, were he not endowed with this Pa&s;&s;ion of HOPE, which gives him a Ta&s;te of tho&s;e good Things that may po&s;&s;ibly come into his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <Q REND="inline"><HI>We &s;hould hope for every Thing that is good,</HI> &s;ays the old Poet <HI>Linus, becau&s;e there is nothing which may not be hoped for, and nothing but what the Gods are able to give us.</HI></Q> HOPE quickens all the &s;till Parts of Life, and keeps the Mind awake in her mo&s;t re|mi&s;s and indolent Hours. It gives ha|bitual Serenity and good Humour: It is a kind of vital Heat to the Soul, that chears and gladdens her, when &s;he does not attend to it. It makes Pain ea&s;y, and Labour plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e &s;everal Advantages which ri&s;e from HOPE, there is another which is none of the lea&s;t, and that is, its great Efficacy in pre&s;erving us from &s;etting too high a Value on pre&s;ent En|joyments. The Saying of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is very

<P>Religious <HI>Hope</HI> has likewi&s;e this Ad|vantage above any other Kind of <HI>Hope,</HI> that it is able to revive the dying Man, and to fill his Mind not only with &s;ecret Comfort and Refre&s;hment, but &s;ome|times with Rapture and Tran&s;port. He triumphs in his Agonies, whil&s;t the Soul &s;prings forward with Delight to the great Object which &s;he has always had in View, and leaves the Body with an Expectation of being re-united to her in a glorious and joyful Re&s;urrection.</P>

<HEAD>The Effects of the SPLEEN.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is a celebrated Thought of <HI>Socrates,</HI> that if all the Misfortunes of Mankind were ca&s;t into a publick Stock, in order to be equally di&s;tri|buted among the whole Species, tho&s;e who now think them&s;elves the mo&s;t unhappy, would prefer the Share they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, before that which would fall to them by &s;uch a Divi&s;ion. <HI>Horace</HI> has carry'd this Thought a great deal farther, intima|ting, That the Hard&s;hips or Misfortunes we lie under, are more ea&s;y to us than tho&s;e of any other Per&s;on would be, in ca&s;e we could change Conditions with him.</P>
<P>As I was ruminating on the&s;e two Remarks, and &s;eated in my Elbow-Chair, I in&s;en&s;ibly fell a&s;leep; when, on a &s;udden, methought there was a Proclamation made by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that e|very Mortal &s;hould bring in his Griefs and Calamities, and throw them toge|ther in a Heap. There was a large Plain appointed for this Purpo&s;e. I
<PB N="155" REF="165">
took my Stand in the Center of it, and &s;aw with a great deal of Plea&s;ure the whole human Species marching one af|ter another, and throwing down their &s;everal Loads, which immediately grew up into a prodigious Mountain that &s;eemed to ri&s;e above the Clouds.</P>
<P>There was a certain Lady of a thin airy Shape, who was very active in this Solemnity. She carried a magni|fying Gla&s;s in one of her Hands, and was cloathed in a loo&s;e flowing Robe, embroidered with &s;everal Figures of Fiends and Spectres, that di&s;covered them&s;elves in a thou&s;and chimerical Shapes, as her Garment hovered in the Wind. There was &s;omething wild and di&s;tracted in her Looks. Her Name was <HI>FANCY.</HI> She led up every Mor|tal to the appointed Place, after having very officiou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in making up his Pack, and laying it upon his Shoulders. My Heart melted within me, to &s;ee my Fellow-Creatures groan|ing under their re&s;pective Burdens, and to con&s;ider that prodigious Bulk of human Calamities which lay before me.</P>
<P>There were however &s;everal Per&s;ons who gave me great Diver&s;ion upon this Occa&s;ion. I ob&s;erved one bringing in
<PB N="156" REF="166">
a Fardel very carefully concealed un|der an old embroidered Cloak, which, upon his throwing it into the Heap, I di&s;covered to be Poverty. Another, after a great deal of Puffing, threw down his Luggage; which, upon ex|amining, I found to be his Wife.</P>
<P>There were Multitudes of Lovers &s;addled with very whim&s;ical Burdens, compo&s;ed of Darts and Flames; but, what was very odd, tho' they &s;ighed as if their Hearts would break under the&s;e Bundles of Calamities, they could not per&s;wade them&s;elves to ca&s;t them into the Heap, when they came up to it; but, after a few faint Efforts, &s;hook their Heads and marched away, as heavy loaden as they came. I &s;aw Mul|titudes of old Women throw down their Wrinkles, and &s;everal young ones who &s;tripped them&s;elves of a tawny Skin. There were very great Heaps of red No&s;es, large Lips, and ru&s;ty Teeth. The Truth of it is, I was &s;urprized to &s;ee the greate&s;t Part of the Mountain made up of bodily Deformities. Ob|&s;erving one advancing towards the Heap with a larger Cargo than ordinary up|on his Back, I found, upon his near Approach, that it was only a natural Hump, which he di&s;po&s;ed of, with
<PB N="157" REF="167">
great Joy of Heart, among this Colle|ction of human Mi&s;eries. There were likewi&s;e Di&s;tempers of all Sorts, tho' I could not but ob&s;erve, that there were many more imaginary than real. One little Packet I could not but take No|tice of, which was a Complication of all the Di&s;ea&s;es incident to human Na|ture, and was in the Hand of a great many fine People: This was called the SPLEEN. But what mo&s;t of all &s;ur|prized me, was a Remark I made, that there was not a &s;ingle Vice or Folly thrown into the whole Heap: At which I was very much a&s;toni&s;hed, having con|cluded within my &s;elf, that every one would take this Opportunity of getting rid of his Pa&s;&s;ions, Prejudices, and Frail|ties.</P>
<P>I took Notice in particular of a very profligate Fellow, who I did not que|&s;tion came loaden with his Crimes, but upon &s;earching into his Bundle, I found, that in&s;tead of throwing his Guilt from him, he had only laid down his Memory. He was followed by another worthle&s;s Rogue, who flung away his Mode&s;ty in&s;tead of his Igno|rance.</P>
<P>When the whole Race of Mankind had thus ca&s;t their Burdens, the <HI>Phan|tome</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="168">
which had been &s;o bu&s;y on this Occa&s;ion, &s;eeing me an idle Spectator of what pa&s;&s;ed, approached towards me. I grew unea&s;y at her Pre&s;ence, when of a &s;udden &s;he held her magnifying Gla&s;s full before my Eyes. I no &s;ooner &s;aw my Face in it, but was &s;tartled at the Shortne&s;s of it, which now appeared to me in its utmo&s;t Aggravation. The immoderate Breadth of the Features made me very much out of Humour with my own Countenance, upon which I threw it from me like a Ma&s;k. It happened very luckily, that one who &s;tood by me had ju&s;t before thrown down his Vi&s;age, which, it &s;eems, was too long for him. It was indeed ex|tended to a mo&s;t &s;hameful Length; I believe the very Chin was, mode&s;tly &s;peaking, as long as my whole Face. We had both of us an Opportunity of mending our &s;elves, and all the Con|tributions being now brought in, every Man was at Liberty to exchange his Misfortune for tho&s;e of another Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;aw, with un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure, the whole Species thus delivered from its Sorrows; tho', at the &s;ame Time, as we &s;tood round the Heap, and &s;urveyed the &s;everal Materials of which it was compo&s;ed, there was &s;carce a Mortal,
<PB N="159" REF="169">
in this va&s;t Multitude, who did not di&s;cover what he thought Plea&s;ures and Ble&s;&s;ings of Life, and wonder'd how the Owners of them ever came to look upon them as Burdens and Grievances.</P>
<P>As we were regarding very attentive|ly this Confu&s;ion of Mi&s;eries, this Chaos of Calamity, <HI>Jupiter</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a &s;econd Proclamation, That every one was now at Liberty to exchange his Affliction, and to return to his Habitation with a|ny &s;uch other Bundle as &s;hould be deli|vered to him.</P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>Fancy</HI> began again to be|&s;tir her&s;elf, and parcelling out the whole Heap with incredible Activity, recom|mended to every one his particular Pac|ket. The Hurry and Confu&s;ion at this Time was not to be expre&s;&s;ed. Some Ob&s;ervations, which I made upon the Occa&s;ion, I &s;hall communicate to the Publick. A venerable grey-headed Man, who had laid down the Cholick, and whom I found wanted an Heir to his E&s;tate, &s;natched up an undutiful Son, that had been thrown into the Heap by his angry Father. The gracele&s;s Youth, in le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour, pulled the old Gentleman by the Beard, and had like to have knocked his Brains out; &s;o that meeting the true Father, who
<PB N="160" REF="170">
came towards him in a Fit of the Gripes, he begged him to take his Son again, and give him back his Cholick; but they were incapable either of them to recede from the Choice they had made. A poor Gally-Slave, who had thrown down his Chains, took up the Gout in their &s;tead, but made &s;uch wry Faces, that one might ea&s;ily perceive he was no great Gainer by the Bargain. It was plea&s;ant enough to &s;ee the &s;everal Ex|changes that were made, for Sickne&s;s again&s;t Poverty, Hunger again&s;t want of Appetite, and Care again&s;t Pain.</P>
<P>The Female World were very bu&s;y among them&s;elves in bartering for Fea|tures; one was trucking a Lock of grey Hairs for a Carbuncle, another was making over a &s;hort Wa&s;te for a Pair of round Shoulders, and a third cheap|ning a bad Face for a lo&s;t Reputation: But on all the&s;e Occa&s;ions, there was not one of them who did not think the new Blemi&s;h, as &s;oon as &s;he had got it into her Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, much more di&s;agree|able than the old one. I made the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation on every other Misfortune or Calamity, which every one in the A&s;&s;embly brought upon him&s;elf, in lieu of what he had parted with; whether it be that all the Evils which befal us
<PB N="161" REF="171">
are in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;uited and propor|tioned to our Strength, or that every Evil becomes more &s;upportable by our being accu&s;tomed to it, I &s;hall not de|termine.</P>
<P>I could not for my Heart forbear pity|ing the poor hump'd-back Gentleman, who went off a very well-&s;haped Per|&s;on with a Stone in his Bladder; nor the fine Gentleman who had &s;truck up this Bargain with him, that limped through a whole A&s;&s;embly of Ladies who u&s;ed to admire him, with a Pair of Shoulders peeping over his Head.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit my own particular Adventure. My Friend with the long Vi&s;age had no &s;ooner taken upon him my &s;hort Face, but he made &s;uch a grote&s;que Figure in it, that as I looked upon him I could not forbear laughing at my &s;elf, in&s;omuch that I put my own Face out of Countenance. The poor Gentleman was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Ridicule, that I found he was a&s;hamed of what he had done: On the other Side I found that I my &s;elf had no great Rea&s;on to triumph, for as I went to touch my Forehead, I mi&s;&s;ed the Place, and clapped my Finger upon my Upper Lip. Be&s;ides, as my No&s;e was exceeding prominent, I gave it two or
<PB N="162" REF="172">
three unlucky Knocks as I was playing my Hand about my Face, and aiming at &s;ome other Part of it. I &s;aw two other Gentlemen by me, who were in the &s;ame ridiculous Circum&s;tances. The&s;e had made a fooli&s;h Swop between a Couple of thick bandy Legs, and two long Trap&s;ticks that had no Calfs to them. One of the&s;e looked like a Man walking upon Stilts, and was &s;o lifted up into the Air above his ordinary Height, that his Head turned round with it, while the other made &s;uch awkward Circles, as he attempted to walk, that he &s;carce knew how to move forward upon his new Supporters: Ob|&s;erving him to be a plea&s;ant kind of a Fellow, I &s;tuck my Cane in the Ground, and told him I would lay him a Bottle of Wine, that he did not march up to it on a Line, that I drew for him, in a Quarter of an Hour.</P>
<P>The Heap was at la&s;t di&s;tributed a|mong the two Sexes, who made a mo&s;t piteous Sight, as they wandered up and down under the Pre&s;&s;ure of their &s;eve|ral Burdens. The whole Plain was filled with Murmurs and Complaints, Groans and Lamentations. <HI>Jupiter</HI> at length, taking Compa&s;&s;ion on the poor Mortals, ordered them a &s;econd Time
<PB N="163" REF="173">
to lay down their Loads, with a De&s;ign to give every one his own again. They di&s;charged them&s;elves with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, after which the <HI>Phantome,</HI> who had led them into &s;uch gro&s;s De|lu&s;ions, was commanded to di&s;appear. There was &s;ent in her &s;tead a Godde&s;s of a quite different Figure; her Moti|ons were &s;teady and compo&s;ed, and her A&s;pect &s;erious but chearful. She every now and then ca&s;t her Eyes towards Heaven, and fixed them upon <HI>Jupiter:</HI> Her Name was <HI>PATIENCE.</HI> She had no &s;ooner placed her &s;elf by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very remarkable, the whole Heap &s;unk to &s;uch a Degree, that it did not ap|pear a third Part &s;o big as it was before. She afterwards returned every Man his own proper Calamity, and teaching him how to bear it in the mo&s;t com|modious Manner, he marched off with it contentedly, being very well plea&s;ed that he had not been left to his own Choice, as to the Kind of Evils which fell to his Lot.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;everal Pieces of Mora|lity to be drawn out of this Vi&s;ion, I learnt from it, never to repine at my own Misfortunes, or to envy the Hap|pine&s;s of another, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="164" REF="174">
for any Man to form a right Judgment of his Neighbour's Sufferings; for which Rea&s;on al&s;o I have determined never to think too lightly of another's Complaints, but to regard the Sorrows of my Fellow-Creatures with Senti|ments of Humanity and Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>Of ORATORY.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was a common Enquiry among the Antients, Why the Number of excellent Ora|tors, under all the Encou|ragements the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing States could give them, fell &s;o far &s;hort of the Number of tho&s;e who ex|celled in all other Sciences? <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That the mo&s;t u&s;eful Animals are the mo&s;t fruitful in their Generation; whereas the Species of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts that are fierce and mi&s;chievous to Mankind, are but &s;carce|ly continued.</HI></Q> The Hi&s;torian in&s;tances in an Hare, which always either breeds or brings forth; and a Lione&s;s, which brings forth but once, and then lo&s;es all Power of Conception. But in the&s;e la|ter Ages we have greater Cau&s;es of Com|plaint
<PB N="165" REF="175">
than the Antients had. Our Mo|derns have greater Advantages towards true and &s;olid Eloquence than any which the celebrated Speakers of Anti|quity enjoy'd.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great and &s;ub&s;tantial Differ|ence is, that their common Places, in which almo&s;t the whole Force of Am|plification con&s;i&s;ts, were drawn from the Profit or Hone&s;ty of the Action, as they regarded only this pre&s;ent State of Du|ration. But Chri&s;tianity, as it exalts Morality to a greater Perfection, as it brings the Con&s;ideration of another Life into the Que&s;tion, as it propo&s;es Rewards and Puni&s;hments of a higher Nature, and a longer Continuance, is more adapted to affect the Minds of the Audience, naturally inclined to pur&s;ue what it imagines its greate&s;t Intere&s;t and Concern. If <HI>Pericles,</HI> as Hi&s;torians re|port, could &s;hake the firme&s;t Re&s;oluti|ons of his Hearers, and &s;et the Pa&s;&s;ions of all <HI>Greece</HI> in a Ferment, when the pre&s;ent Welfare of his Country, or the Fear of ho&s;tile Inva&s;ions was the Sub|ject, what may be expected from that Orator, who warns his Audience again&s;t tho&s;e Evils which have no Remedy, when once undergone, either from Pru|dence or Time? As much greater as the
<PB N="166" REF="176">
Evils in a future State are than the&s;e at pre&s;ent, &s;o much are the Motives to Per|&s;ua&s;ion under Chri&s;tianity greater than tho&s;e which meer moral Con&s;iderations could &s;upply us with. But what is now mention'd relates only to the Power of moving the Affections. There is another Part of Eloquence, which is indeed its Ma&s;ter-piece, which is the Marvellous and Sublime. In this the Chri&s;tian O|rator has the Advantage beyond Con|tradiction. Our Ideas are &s;o infinitely enlarged by Revelation, the Eye of Rea|&s;on has &s;o wide a Pro&s;pect into Eternity, the Notions of a Deity are &s;o worthy and refin'd, and the Accounts we have of a State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery &s;o clear and evident, that the Contempla|tion of &s;uch Objects will give our Di&s;|cour&s;e a noble Vigour, an invincible Force, beyond the Power of any hu|man Con&s;ideration. <HI>Tully</HI> requires in his perfect Orator &s;ome Skill in the Na|ture of Heavenly Bodies; becau&s;e, &s;ays he, his Mind will become more exten|&s;ive and unconfined; and when he de|&s;cends to treat of human Affairs, he will both think and write in a more ex|alted and magnificent Manner. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on that excellent Ma&s;ter would have recommended the Study of tho&s;e
<PB N="167" REF="177">
great and glorious My&s;teries which Re|velation has di&s;covered to us; to which the noble&s;t Parts of this Sy&s;tem of the World are as much inferior, as the Crea|ture is le&s;s excellent than its Creator. The wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t knowing among the Heathens, had very poor and im|perfect Notions of a future State. They had indeed &s;ome uncertain Hopes, ei|ther received by Tradition, or gathered by Rea&s;on, that the Exi&s;tence of virtu|ous Men would not be determined by the Separation of Soul and Body: But they either di&s;believed a future State of Puni&s;hment and Mi&s;ery, or, upon the &s;ame Account that <HI>Apelles</HI> painted <HI>Anti|gonus,</HI> with one Side only to the Specta|tor, that the Lo&s;s of his Eye might not ca&s;t a Blemi&s;h upon the whole Piece; &s;o the&s;e repre&s;ented the Condition of Man in its faire&s;t View, and endeavoured to conceal what they thought was a Defor|mity to human Nature. I have often ob&s;erved, that whenever the abovemen|tioned Orator, in his Philo&s;ophical Di&s;|cour&s;es, is led by his Argument to the Mention of Immortality, he &s;eems like one awaked out of Sleep, rouzed and alarmed with the Dignity of the Sub|ject, he &s;tretches his Imagination to con|ceive &s;omething uncommon, and with
<PB N="168" REF="178">
the Greatne&s;s of his Thoughts ca&s;ts, as it were, a Glory round the Sentence: Uncertain and un&s;ettled as he was, he &s;eems fired with the Contemplation of it; and nothing but &s;uch a glorious Pro&s;pect could have forced &s;o great a Lover of Truth, as he was, to declare his Re&s;olution, never to part with his Per|&s;ua&s;ion of Immortality, though it &s;hould be proved to be an erroneous one. But had he lived to &s;ee all that Chri&s;tianity has brought to Light, how would he have lavi&s;hed out all the Force of Elo|quence in tho&s;e noble&s;t Contemplations which human Nature is capable of, the Re&s;urrection, and the Judgment that follows it? How had his Brea&s;t glowed with Plea&s;ure, when the whole Com|pa&s;s of Futurity lay open and expo&s;ed to his View? How would his Imagina|tion have hurryed him on in the Pur&s;uit of the My&s;teries of the Incarnation? How would he have entered with the Force of Lightning into the Affections of his Hearers, and fixed their Attenti|on, in Spite of all the Oppo&s;ition of corrupt Nature, upon tho&s;e glorious Themes which his Eloquence hath pain|ted in &s;uch lively and la&s;ting Colours?</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="179">This Advantage Chri&s;tians have; and it was with no &s;mall Plea&s;ure I lately met with a Fragment of <HI>Longinus,</HI> which is pre&s;erved as a Te&s;timony of that Cri|tick's Judgment, at the Beginning of a Manu&s;cript of the New Te&s;tament in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library. After that Author has numbered up the mo&s;t celebrated Orators among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline"><HI>Add to the&s;e</HI> Paul <HI>of</HI> Tar&s;us, <HI>the Patron of an Opinion not yet fully prov'd.</HI></Q> As a Heathen, he condemns the Chri&s;tian Religion; and as an impartial Critick, he judges in Favour of the Promoter and Preacher of it. To me it &s;eems, that the latter Part of his Judgment adds great Weight to his Opinion of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Abilities, &s;ince, under all the Prejudice of Opinions directly oppo&s;ite, he is con|&s;trained to acknowledge the Merit of that Apo&s;tle. And, no Doubt, &s;uch as <HI>Longinus</HI> de&s;cribes St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;uch he ap|peared to the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Coun|tries which he vi&s;ited and ble&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e Doctrines he was divinely commi&s;|&s;ioned to preach. Sacred Story gives us, in one Circum&s;tance, a convincing Proof of his Eloquence, when the Men of <HI>Ly&s;tra</HI> called him <HI>Mercury, becau&s;e he was the chief Speaker,</HI> and would have
<PB N="170" REF="180">
paid divine Wor&s;hip to him, as to the God who invented and prefided over Eloquence. This one Account of our Apo&s;tle &s;ets his Character, con&s;idered as an Orator only, above all the celebrated Relations of the Skill and Influence of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and his Contemporaries. Their Power in Speaking was admired, but &s;till it was thought human: Their Eloquence warmed and ravi&s;hed the Hearers, but &s;till it was thought the Voice of Man, not the Voice of God. What Advantage then had St. <HI>Paul</HI> above tho&s;e of <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome?</HI> I confe&s;s I can a&s;|cribe this Excellence to nothing but the Power of the Doctrines he delivered, which may have &s;till the &s;ame Influence on the Hearers; which have &s;till the Power, when preached by a &s;kilful O|rator, to make us break out in the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions as the Di&s;ciples, who met our Saviour in their Way to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> made U&s;e of; <Q REND="inline"><HI>Did not our Hearts burn within us, when he talked to us by the Way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</HI></Q> I may be thought bold in my Judgment by &s;ome; but I mu&s;t affirm, That no one Orator has left us &s;o vi&s;ible Marks and Foot&s;teps of his Eloquence as our Apo&s;tle. It may perhaps be won|dered
<PB N="169" REF="181">
at, that in his Rea&s;onings upon Idolatry at <HI>Athens,</HI> where Eloquence was born and flouri&s;hed, he confines him&s;elf to &s;trict Argument only; but my Rea|der may remember what many Authors of the be&s;t Credit have a&s;&s;ured us, That all Attempts upon the Affections, and Strokes of Oratory, were expre&s;ly for|bidden, by the Laws of that Country, in Courts of Judicature. His Want of Eloquence therefore here, was the Ef|fect of his exact Conformity to the Laws: But his Di&s;cour&s;e on the Re&s;ur|rection to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> his Harangue before <HI>Agrippa</HI> upon his own Conver&s;i|on, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of that of others, are truly great, and may &s;erve as full Examples to tho&s;e excellent Rules for the Sublime, which the be&s;t of Criticks has left us. The Sum of all this Di&s;|cour&s;e is, That our Clergy have no far|ther to look for an Example of the Per|fection they may arrive at, than to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Harangues; that when he, under the Want of &s;everal Advantages of Na|ture, (as he him&s;elf tells us) was heard, admired, and made a Standard to &s;uc|ceeding Ages by the be&s;t Judge of a dif|ferent Per&s;ua&s;ion in Religion: I &s;ay, Our Clergy may learn, that however in&s;tructive their Sermons are, they are

<P>As I was &s;urveying the Moon walk|ing in her Brightne&s;s, and taking her Progre&s;s among the Con&s;tellations, a Thought ro&s;e in me, which I believe very often perplexes and di&s;turbs Men of &s;erious and contemplative Natures. <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf fell into it, in that Refle|ction, <Q REND="inline"><HI>When I con&s;ider the Heavens, the Work of thy Fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou ha&s;t ordained; what is Man that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of Man that thou regarde&s;t him!</HI></Q> In the &s;ame manner, when I con&s;idered that infinite Ho&s;te of Stars, or, to &s;peak more philo&s;ophically, of Suns, which were then &s;hining upon me, with tho&s;e innumerable Sets of Planets or Worlds, which were moving round their re&s;pect|ive Suns: When I &s;till enlarged the Idea, and &s;uppo&s;ed another Heaven of Suns and Worlds ri&s;ing &s;till above this which we di&s;covered, and the&s;e &s;till en|lightened by a &s;uperior Firmament of Luminaries, which are planted at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, that they may appear to the Inhabitants of the former as the Stars do to us. In &s;hort, whil&s;t I pur|&s;ued this Thought, I could not but re|flect
<PB N="172" REF="184">
on that little in&s;ignificant Figure which I my &s;elf bore amid&s;t the Immen|&s;ity of God's Works.</P>
<P>Were the Sun, which enlightens this Part of the Creation, with all the Ho&s;t of Planetary Worlds that move about him, utterly extingui&s;hed and annihila|ted, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed more than a Grain of Sand upon the Sea-&s;hore. The Space they po&s;&s;e&s;s is &s;o exceedingly little, in compari&s;on of the whole, that it would &s;carce make a <HI>Blank</HI> in the Crea|tion. The Cha&s;m would be imperceptible to an Eye that could take in the whole Compa&s;s of Nature, and pa&s;s from one End of the Creation to the other, as it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a Sen&s;e in our &s;elves hereafter, or in Creatures which are at pre&s;ent more exalted than our &s;elves. We &s;ee many Stars by the Help of Gla&s;&s;es, which we do not di&s;|cover with our naked Eyes; and the finer our Tele&s;copes are, the more &s;till are our Di&s;coveries. <HI>Huygenius</HI> carries this Thought &s;o far, that he does not think it impo&s;&s;ible there may be Stars, who&s;e Light is not yet travelled down to us &s;ince their fir&s;t Creation. There is no Que&s;tion but the Univer&s;e has cer|tain Bounds &s;et to it; but when we con|&s;ider that it is the Work of infinite
<PB N="173" REF="185">
Power, prompted by infinite Goodne&s;s, with an infinite Space to exert it&s;elf in, how can our Imagination &s;et any Bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return therefore to my fir&s;t Thought, I could not but look upon my &s;elf with &s;ecret Horror, as a Being that was not worth the &s;malle&s;t Regard of one who had &s;o great a Work under his Care and Superintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amid&s;t the Immen&s;i|ty of Nature, and lo&s;t among that infi|nite Variety of Creatures, which in all Probability &s;warm through all the&s;e im|mea&s;urable Regions of Matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my &s;elf from this mortifying Thought, I con&s;idered that it took its Ri&s;e from tho&s;e narrow Con|ceptions which we are apt to entertain of the Divine Nature. We our&s;elves cannot attend to many different Objects at the &s;ame Time. If we are careful to in&s;pect &s;ome Things, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e neglect others. This Imperfection which we ob&s;erve in our &s;elves, is an Imperfe|ction that cleaves in &s;ome Degree to Creatures of the highe&s;t Capacities, as they are Creatures, that is, Beings of fi|nite and limited Natures. The Pre&s;ence of every Being is confined to a certain Mea&s;ure of Space, and con&s;equently his
<PB N="174" REF="186">
Ob&s;ervation is &s;tinted to a certain Num|ber of Objects. The Sphere in which we move, and act, and under&s;tand, is of a wider Circumference to one Crea|ture than another, according as we ri&s;e one above another in the Scale of Exi&s;t|ence. But the wide&s;t of the&s;e our Spheres has its Circumference. When therefore we reflect on the Divine Na|ture, we are &s;o u&s;ed and accu&s;tomed to this Imperfection in our&s;elves, that we cannot forbear in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;cribing it to him in whom there is no Shadow of Imperfection. Our Rea&s;on indeed a&s;&s;ures us that his Attributes are infinite, but the Poorne&s;s of our Conceptions is &s;uch, that it cannot forbear &s;etting Bounds to every thing it contemplates, 'till our Rea&s;on comes again to our Suc|cour, and throws down all tho&s;e little Prejudices which ri&s;es in us unawares, and are natural to the Mind of Man.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore utterly extingui&s;h this melancholy Thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the Multi|plicity of his Works, and the Infinity of tho&s;e Objects among which he &s;eems to be ince&s;&s;antly employed, if we con&s;ider in the fir&s;t Place that he is Omnipre&s;ent, and, in the &s;econd, that he is Omni&s;ci|ent.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="187">If we con&s;ider him in his Omnipre|&s;ence: His Being pa&s;&s;es through, actu|ates, and &s;upports the whole Frame of Nature. His Creation, and every Part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either &s;o di&s;tant, &s;o little, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, which he does not e&s;&s;entially inhabit. His Sub|&s;tance is within the Sub&s;tance of every Being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately pre&s;ent to it, as that Being is to it &s;elf. It would be an Im|perfection in him, were he able to re|move out of one Place into another, or to withdraw him&s;elf from any thing he has created, or from any Part of that Space which is diffu&s;ed and &s;pread abroad to Infinity. In &s;hort, to &s;peak of him in the Language of the old Philo&s;opher, he is a Being who&s;e Centre is every where, and his Circumference is no where.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Place, he is Omnipre|&s;ent as well as Omni&s;cient. His Om|ni&s;cience indeed nece&s;&s;arily and natural|ly flows from his Omnipre&s;ence; he can|not but be con&s;cious of every Motion that ari&s;es in the whole material World, which he thus e&s;&s;entially pervades, and of every Thought that is &s;tirring in the intellectual World, to every Part of
<PB N="176" REF="188">
which he is thus intimately united. Se|veral Morali&s;ts have con&s;idered the Cre|ation as the Temple of God, which he has built with his own Hands, and which is filled with his Pre&s;ence. O|thers have con&s;idered infinite Space as the Receptacle, or rather the Habitation of the Almighty: But the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exalted Way of con&s;idering this infinite Space, is that of Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>'s, who calls it the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> of the Godhead. Brutes and Men have their <HI>Sen&s;oriola,</HI> or little <HI>Sen&s;oriums,</HI> by which they apprehend the Pre&s;ence, and per|ceive the Actions of a few Objects that lye contiguous to them: Their Know|ledge and Ob&s;ervation turns within a very narrow Circle. But as God Al|mighty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which he re&s;ides, infinite Space gives Room to infinite Knowledge, and is, as it were, an Organ to Omni|&s;cience.</P>
<P>Were the Soul &s;eparate from the Bo|dy, and with one Glance of Thought &s;hould &s;tart beyond the Bounds of the Creation, &s;hould it for Millions of Years continue its Progre&s;s through in|finite Space with the &s;ame Activity, it would &s;till find it&s;elf within the Em|brace of its Creator, and encompa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="177" REF="189">
round with the Immen&s;ity of the God|head. Whil&s;t we are in the Body he is not le&s;s pre&s;ent with us, be|cau&s;e he is concealed from us. <Q REND="inline"><HI>O that I knew where I might find him!</HI> &s;ays <HI>Job. Behold I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot per|ceive him. On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth him&s;elf on the right hand, that I cannot &s;ee him.</HI></Q> In &s;hort, Rea&s;on as well as Revelation a&s;&s;ures us, that he cannot be ab&s;ent from us, notwith&s;tanding he is undi&s;covered by us.</P>
<P>In this Con&s;ideration of God Almigh|ty's Omnipre&s;ence and Omni&s;cience e|very Thought vani&s;hes. He cannot but regard every Thing that has Being, e&s;pecially &s;uch of his Creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their Thoughts, and to that Anxiety of Heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this Occa&s;ion: For as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould overlook any of his Creatures, &s;o we may be confident that he regards, with an Eye of Mercy, tho&s;e who en|deavour to recommend them&s;elves to his Notice, and in an unfeigned Humi|lity of Heart think them&s;elves unwor|thy that he &s;hould be mindful of them.</P>

<HEAD>The Happine&s;s of SOULS in HEAVEN.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have always taken a parti|cular Plea&s;ure in examining the Opinions which Men of different Religions, different Ages, and different Coun|tries, have entertained concerning the Immortality of the Soul, and the State of Happine&s;s which they promi&s;e them|&s;elves in another World. For whatever Prejudices and Errors human Nature lies under, we find that either Rea&s;on, or Tradition from our fir&s;t Parents, has di&s;covered to all People &s;omething in the&s;e great Points which bears Analogy to Truth, and to the Doctrines opened to us by Divine Revelation. I was late|ly di&s;cour&s;ing on this Subject with a learned Per&s;on who has been very much conver&s;ant among the Inhabitants of the more We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Africk:</HI> Upon his conver&s;ing with &s;everal in that Country, he tells me, that their Notion of Heaven, or of a future State of Happi|ne&s;s is this, That every Thing we there wi&s;h for will immediately pre&s;ent it &s;elf to us. We find, &s;ay they, our Souls
<PB N="179" REF="191">
are of &s;uch a Nature that they require Variety, and are not capable of being always delighted with the &s;ame Objects. The Supreme Being therefore, in Compli|ance with this Ta&s;te of Happine&s;s which he has planted in the Soul of Man, will rai&s;e up from Time to Time, they &s;ay, every Gratification which it is in the Humour to be plea&s;ed with. If we wi&s;h to be in Groves or Bowers, among running Streams or Falls of Water, we &s;hall immediately find our &s;elves in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a Scene as we de&s;ire. If we would be entertained with Mu&s;ick and the Melody of Sounds, the Con&s;ort ri&s;es upon our Wi&s;h, and the whole Region about us is filled with Harmony. In &s;hort, every De&s;ire will be followed by Fruition, and whatever a Man's In|clination directs him to, will be pre&s;ent with him. Nor is it material whether the Supreme Power creates in Confor|mity to our Wi&s;hes, or whether he on|ly produces &s;uch a Change in our Ima|gination, as makes us believe our &s;elves conver&s;ant among tho&s;e Scenes which delight us. Our Happine&s;s will be the &s;ame, whether it proceed from external Objects, or from the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Deity upon our own private Fancies. This is the Account which I have re|ceived
<PB N="180" REF="192">
from my learned Friend. Not|with&s;tanding this Sy&s;tem of Belief be in general very chimerical and vi&s;ionary, there is &s;omething &s;ublime in its Man|ner of con&s;idering the Influence of a Divine Being on a human Soul. It has al&s;o, like mo&s;t other Opinions of the Heathen World upon the&s;e important Points, it has, I &s;ay, its Foundation in Truth, as it &s;uppo&s;es the Souls of good Men after this Life to be in a State of perfect Happine&s;s, that in this State there will be no barren Hopes, nor fruitle&s;s Wi&s;hes, and that we &s;hall en|joy every Thing we can de&s;ire. But the particular Circum&s;tance which I am mo&s;t plea&s;ed with in this Scheme, and which ari&s;es from a ju&s;t Reflection up|on human Nature, is that Variety of Plea&s;ures which it &s;uppo&s;es the Souls of good Men will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in a|nother World. This I think highly probable, from the Dictates of both Rea&s;on and Revelation. The Soul con|&s;i&s;ts of many Faculties, as the Under|&s;tanding, and the Will, with all the Sen&s;es both outward and inward; or, to &s;peak more philo&s;ophically, the Soul can exert her &s;elf in many different Ways of Action: She can under&s;tand, will, imagine, &s;ee and hear, love and
<PB N="181" REF="193">
di&s;cour&s;e, and apply her &s;elf to many other the like Exerci&s;es of different Kinds and Natures; but what is more to be con&s;idered, the Soul is capable of receiving a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction from the Exerci&s;e of any of the&s;e its Powers, when they are gratified with their proper Objects; &s;he can be entirely happy by the Satisfa|ction of the Memory, the Sight, the Hearing, or any other Mode of Percep|tion. Every Faculty is as a di&s;tinct Ta&s;te in the Mind, and hath Objects ac|commodated to its proper Reli&s;h. Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> &s;omewhere &s;ays, that he will not pre&s;ume to determine in what con|&s;i&s;ts the Happine&s;s of the Ble&s;s'd, becau&s;e God Almighty is capable of making the Soul happy by Ten Thou&s;and dif|ferent Ways. Be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;everal A|venues to Plea&s;ure which the Soul is endowed with in this Life, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, according to the Opinions of many eminent Divines, but there may be new Faculties in the Souls of good Men made perfect, as well as new Sen&s;es in their glorified Bodies. This we are &s;ure of, that there will be new Objects offered to all tho&s;e Faculties which are e&s;&s;ential to us.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="194">We are likewi&s;e to take Notice, that every particular Faculty is capable of being employed on a very great Variety of Objects. The Under&s;tanding, for Example, may be happy in the Con|templation of Moral, Natural, Mathe|matical, and other Kinds of Truth. The Memory likewi&s;e may turn it &s;elf to an infinite Multitude of Objects, e|&s;pecially when the Soul &s;hall have pa&s;|&s;ed through the Space of many Milli|ons of Years, and &s;hall reflect with Plea|&s;ure on the Days of Eternity. Every other Faculty may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame Extent.</P>
<P>We cannot que&s;tion but that the Hap|pine&s;s of a Soul will be adequate to its Nature, and that it is not endowed with any Faculties which are to lye u&s;ele&s;s and unemploy'd. The Happine&s;s is to be the Happine&s;s of the whole Man, and we may ea&s;ily conceive to our &s;elves the Happine&s;s of the Soul, whil&s;t any one of its Faculties is in the Fruition of its chief Good. The Happine&s;s may be of a more exalted Nature in Propor|tion as the Faculty employed is &s;o, but as the whole Soul acts in the Exertion of any of its particular Powers, the whole Soul is happy in the Plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from any of its particular
<PB N="183" REF="195">
Acts. For notwith&s;tanding, as has been before hinted, and as it has been taken Notice of by one of the greate&s;t mo|dern Philo&s;ophers, we divide the Soul into &s;everal Powers and Faculties, there is no &s;uch Divi&s;ion in the Soul it &s;elf, &s;ince it is the whole Soul that remem|bers, under&s;tands, wills, or imagines. Our Manner of con&s;idering the Memo|ry, Under&s;tanding, Will, Imagination, and the like Faculties, is for the better enabling us to expre&s;s our &s;elves in &s;uch ab&s;tracted Subjects of Speculation, not that there is any &s;uch Divi&s;ion in the Soul it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Seeing then that the Soul has many different Faculties, or, in other Words, many different Ways of acting; that it can be inten&s;ely plea&s;ed, or made happy, by all the&s;e different Faculties, or Ways of acting; that it may be en|dowed with &s;everal latent Faculties, which it is not at pre&s;ent in a Condi|tion to exert; that we cannot believe the Soul is endowed with any Faculty which is of no U&s;e to it; that when|ever any one of the&s;e Faculties is tran|&s;cendently plea&s;ed, the Soul is in a State of Happine&s;s; and, in the la&s;t Place, con&s;idering that the Happine&s;s of another World is to be the Happine&s;s
<PB N="184" REF="196">
of the whole Man, who can que&s;tion but that there is an infinite Variety in tho&s;e Plea&s;ures we are &s;peaking of; and that this Fulne&s;s of Joy will be made up of all tho&s;e Plea&s;ures which the Nature of the Soul is capable of re|ceiving!</P>
<P>We &s;hall be the more confirmed in this Doctrine, if we ob&s;erve the Nature of Variety, with regard to the Mind of Man. The Soul does not care to be always in the &s;ame Bent. The Facul|ties relieve one another by Turns, and receive an additional Plea&s;ure from the Novelty of tho&s;e Objects, about which they are conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>Revelation likewi&s;e very much con|firms this Notion, under the different Views which it gives us of our future Happine&s;s. In the De&s;cription of the Throne of God, it repre&s;ents to us all tho&s;e Objects which are able to gratify the Sen&s;es and Imagination. In very many Places it intimates to us all the Happine&s;s which the Under&s;tanding can po&s;&s;ibly receive in that State, where all Things &s;hall be revealed to us, and we &s;hall know, even as we are known; the Raptures of Devotion, of Divine Love, the Plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, with an innume|rable
<PB N="185" REF="197">
Ho&s;t of Angels, and with the Spi|rits of Ju&s;t Men made Perfect, are like|wi&s;e revealed to us in &s;everal Parts of the Holy Writings. There are al&s;o mentioned tho&s;e Hierarchies, or Go|vernments, in which the Ble&s;t &s;hall be ranged one above another, and in which we may be &s;ure a great Part of our Happine&s;s will likewi&s;e con&s;i&s;t; for it will not be there as in this World, where every one is aiming at Power and Superiority; but, on the contrary, every one will find that Station the mo&s;t proper for him in which he is placed, and will probably think that he could not have been &s;o happy in any other Station. The&s;e and many other Particulars are marked in Divine Revela|tion as the &s;everal Ingredients of our Happine&s;s in Heaven, which all imply &s;uch a Variety of Joys, and &s;uch a Gratification of the Soul in all its diffe|rent Faculties, as I have been here men|tioning.</P>
<P>Some of the Rabbins tell us, that the Cherubims are a Set of Angels who know mo&s;t, and the Seraphims a Set of Angels who love mo&s;t. Whether this Di&s;tinction be not altogether ima|ginary I &s;hall not here examine; but it is highly probable that among the Spi|rits
<PB N="186" REF="198">
of good Men there may be &s;ome who will be more plea&s;ed with the Em|ployment of one Faculty than of ano|ther, and this perhaps according to tho&s;e innocent and virtuous Habits or Incli|nations which have here taken the deep|e&s;t Root.</P>
<P>I might here apply this Con&s;ideration to the Spirits of wicked Men, with re|lation to the Pain they &s;hall &s;uffer in every one of their Faculties, and the re|&s;pective Mi&s;eries which &s;hall be appro|priated to each Faculty in particular. But leaving this to the Reflection of my Readers, I &s;hall conclude, with ob&s;erv|ing how we ought to be thankful to our great Creator, and rejoice in the Being which he has be&s;towed upon us, for ha|ving made the Soul &s;u&s;ceptible of Plea|&s;ure by &s;o many different Ways. We &s;ee by what a Variety of Pa&s;&s;ages Joy and Gladne&s;s may enter into the Thoughts of Man: How wonderfully a human Spirit is framed, to imbibe its proper Satisfactions, and ta&s;te the Good|ne&s;s of its Creator. We may therefore look into our &s;elves with Rapture and Amazement, and cannot &s;ufficiently ex|pre&s;s our Gratitude to him, who has en|compa&s;&s;ed us with &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of
<PB N="187" REF="199">
Ble&s;&s;iegs, and open'd in us &s;o many Ca|pacities of enjoying them.</P>
<P>There cannot be a &s;tronger Argument that God has de&s;igned us for a State of future Happine&s;s, and for that Heaven which he has revealed to us, than that he has thus naturally qualified the Soul for it, and made it a Being capable of receiving &s;o much Bli&s;s. He would ne|ver have made &s;uch Faculties in vain, and have endowed us with Powers that were not to be exerted on &s;uch Objects as are &s;uited to them. It is very mani|fe&s;t, by the inward Frame and Con&s;ti|tution of our Minds, that he has adap|ted them to an infinite Variety of Plea|&s;ures and Gratifications, which are not to be met with in this Life. We &s;hould therefore at all times take Care that we do not di&s;appoint this his gracious Pur|po&s;e and Intention towards us, and make tho&s;e Faculties which he formed as &s;o many Qualifications for Happine&s;s and Rewards, to be the In&s;truments of Pain and Puni&s;hment.</P>
