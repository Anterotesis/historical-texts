<HEAD>TO JOHN COWLEY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN letters were in their in&s;ancy, and when knowledge and the arts were groping their way through &s;eemingly impervious mi&s;ts, &s;ome &s;plendid name was nece&s;&s;ary to give an author celebrity&mdash;hence the cu&s;tom of DEDICATIONS; hence tho&s;e f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oods of adula|tion, which poured from the pre&s;s, and outraged the feel|ings of the addre&s;&s;er and the addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But now, when poets and writers of every denomina|tion, accept patronage only from the public, and when fame is to be obtained only by de&s;erving it, the cu&s;tom of dedicating can be continued, only, as a medium through which to convey per&s;onal re&s;pect. It is <HI>delightful</HI> to make an offering to tho&s;e we love, when that offering has had a value &s;tampt on it, by the voice of the world. Thus THE FATE OF SPARTA wreathed with laurel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;eeks you in the rece&s;&s;es of a counting-hou&s;e; and whil&s;t you are engaged in &s;upporting our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">tional manufactures, and invoking commerce from her di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ant abodes, &s;olicits your attention to the MUSES.</P>
<P>When I hinted an intention to addre&s;s this Tragedy to you, you &s;hrunk from the idea, and de&s;ired me to choo&s;e a worthier name. My deare&s;t Brother, where &s;hall I
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
turn to find it? THIS &s;hall <HI>not</HI> be an addre&s;s of adula|tion, therefore I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e to whom you are known, will acknowledge that I am ju&s;tified in the choice I have made of a patron; and tho&s;e who know you not, will do my pride the credit to believe I &s;hould not have &s;elected for that patron, a man who&s;e name and who&s;e &s;ituation did not reflect honour on me.</P>
<P>There is yet another motive for u&s;ing my <HI>poetic wand</HI> to call your &s;hade before po&s;terity. As your regard has been one of the chief ble&s;&s;ings of my life, I wi&s;h tho&s;e who &s;ucceed us to know how much I hold my&s;elf indebted to it: I wi&s;h my own children and yours to feel the &s;weet inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uence of our mutual friend&s;hip; and as they will carry in their veins the &s;ame blood, to cheri&s;h in their hearts the &s;ame attachment. DEAR Children! who will wan|der again and again over this page, after the hand which traces it moves no more, after the heart to which it is addre&s;&s;ed, hath cea&s;ed to beat!</P>
<P>I was going to conclude with this pen&s;ive idea, but I recollect that I have not yet mentioned in <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">dicatory form,</HI> the work dedicated. The following Tragedy then, Sir, is in its fable and events, all invention&mdash;except in the conduct of Chelonice, and the &s;cene in the Temple;&mdash;and with the circum&s;tance on which <HI>that</HI> is founded, I have taken &s;ome liberties. Other deviations from hi&s;tory will &s;trike you, but if I have altered circum&s;tances, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> by CHARACTER. Leonidas at Drury-Lane, as in Sparta, is artful, tyrannic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, and doats on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aughter. The impetuous and crafty Amphares, who
<PB N="v" REF="4">
had de&s;troyed Agis, continues his &s;y&s;tem. Cleombrotus, ambitious and tolerably ob&s;tinate, is yet &s;en&s;ible to the merits of his wife. He, though my hero, is not "a faultle&s;s mon&s;ter;"&mdash;if the lady &s;hould be <HI>too perfect,</HI> I appeal to the grave authority of Plutarch, who I believe is not &s;u&s;pected of writing fictions to compliment women.</P>
<P>Struck with admiration at the &s;light yet powerful touches, with which that biographi&s;t had &s;ketched the cha|racter of CHELONIS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Life of Agis.</NOTE>, I wondered &s;uch a character had never been brought on the Stage, to do honour to her &s;ex;&mdash;yet I had joy in reflecting, that this was preci&s;ely the age in which it ought to be done, for this age boa&s;ted a Mrs. SIDDONS.</P>
<P>How much the FATE OF SPARTA has been indebted to that lady, and to &s;ome of the other performers, the public prints bear te&s;timony&mdash;and I gratefully record it: becau&s;e it is a circum&s;tance highly flattering to my&s;elf, and be|cau&s;e I wi&s;h the pre&s;ent I thus offer you, to be &s;urrounded with every appendage that can make you feel it ine&s;ti|mable.</P>
