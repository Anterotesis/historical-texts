<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following E&s;&s;ay has endeavoured to draw into one continued Scheme the whole State of the pre&s;ent War, and the Methods that ap|pear to him the mo&s;t proper for bringing it to a happy Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>After having con&s;idered that the <HI>French</HI> are the con&s;tant and mo&s;t dangerous Enemies to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and that the Danger from them is now greater than ever, and will &s;till in|crea&s;e till their pre&s;ent &V;nion with <HI>Spain</HI> be broken, he &s;ets forth the &s;everal Advantages which this &V;nion has already given <HI>France,</HI> and taken from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in relation to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Wollen Manufacture, the Trade of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the Naval Power of the Two Nations.</P>
<P>He &s;hews how the&s;e Advantages will &s;till ri&s;e higher after a Peace, notwith&s;tanding our
<PB REF="4">
pre&s;ent Conque&s;ts, with new Additions, &s;hou'd be confirmed to us; as well becau&s;e the Mo|narchy of <HI>Spain</HI> wou'd not be weakened by &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions, as becau&s;e no Guarantee cou'd be found &s;ufficient to &s;ecure them to us. For which Rea&s;ons he lays it down as a fixt Rule, That no Peace is to be made without an entire Di&s;union of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchies.</P>
<P>That this may be brought about he endea|vours to prove from the Progre&s;s we have al|ready made towards it, and the Succe&s;&s;es we have purcha&s;ed in the pre&s;ent War, which are very con&s;iderable if well pur&s;ued, but of no effect if we acquie&s;ce in them.</P>
<P>In order to compleat this Di&s;union in which we have gone &s;o far, he wou'd not have us relie upon exhau&s;ting the <HI>French</HI> Trea&s;ury, at|tempts on the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> De&s;cents on <HI>France,</HI> but chiefly upon out-numbring them in Troops, <HI>France</HI> being already drained of her be&s;t Supplies, and the Confederates Ma&s;ters of much greater Forces for Multitude and Strength, both in Men and Hor&s;e, and provided with Generals of greater Fame and Abilities.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
He then con&s;iders the wrong Mea&s;ures we have hitherto taken in making too &s;mall Levies after a &s;ucce&s;sful Campaign, in Re|gulating their number by that of the Enemys Forces, and Hiring them of our Confede|rates; &s;hewing at the &s;ame time the Incon|veniencies we &s;uffer from &s;uch hir'd Troops, and &s;everal Advantages we might receive from Employing tho&s;e of our own Nation.</P>
<P>He further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> this Augmentation of our Forces, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the keeping up a Standing Body of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> times of Peace, to enable us to make an Impre&s;&s;ion on the Ene|my in the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of the War, and to &s;ecure our &s;elves again&s;t a Prince, who is now at the Head of a powerful Army, and has not yet declared him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, he an&s;wers by &s;everal Con&s;iderations tho&s;e two Popular Objections, That we furni&s;h more towards the War than the re&s;t of the Allies, and that we are not able to contribute more than we do already.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The&s;e are the mo&s;t material Heads of the following E&s;&s;ay, in which there are many other &s;ubordinate Reflections that natu|rally grow out of &s;o copious a Subject.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WAR, AND THE NECESSITY OF AN Augmentation CONSIDER'D.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> are certainly the mo&s;t im|placable, and the mo&s;t dangerous E|nemys of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation. Their Form of Government, their Religion, their Jealou&s;y of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Power, as well as their Pro&s;ecutions of Commerce, and Pur|&s;uits
<PB N="2" REF="8">
of Univer&s;al Monarchy, will fix them for ever in their Animo&s;ities and Aver&s;ions towards us, and make them catch at all Opportunities of &s;ubverting our Con&s;titu|tion, de&s;troying our Religion, ruining our Trade, and &s;inking the Figure which we make among the Nations of <HI>Europe:</HI> Not to mention the particular Ties of Honour that lie on their pre&s;ent King to impo&s;e on us a Prince, who mu&s;t prove fatal to our Coun|try if he ever reigns over us.</P>
<P>As we are thus in a natural State of War, if I may &s;o call it, with the <HI>French</HI> Nation; it is our Misfortune, that they are not only the mo&s;t inveterate, but mo&s;t formidable of our Enemies; and have the greate&s;t Power, as well as the &s;tronge&s;t Inclination to ruin us. No other State equals them in the Force of their Fleets and Armies, in the Nearne&s;s and Conveniency of their Situation, and in the Number of Friends and Well|wi&s;hers, which, it is to be fear'd, they have among us.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons our Wars with <HI>France</HI> have always affected us in our mo&s;t tender Intere&s;ts, and concern'd us more than tho&s;e we have had with any other Nation; but I
<PB N="3" REF="9">
may venture to &s;ay, This Kingdom was ne|ver yet engag'd in a War of &s;o great con|&s;equence, as that which now lies upon our hands. Our All is at &s;take, and irretrie|vably lo&s;t, if we fail of Succe&s;s. At other times, if a War ended in a di&s;honourable Peace, or with equal Lo&s;s, we cou'd com|fort our &s;elves with the hopes of a more favourable Juncture, that might &s;et the Bal|lance right, or turn it to our Advantage. We had &s;till the pro&s;pect of forming the &s;ame Alliance, or perhaps &s;trengthning it with new Confederacies, and by that means of trying our Fortune a &s;econd time, in ca&s;e the Inju&s;tice or Ambition of the Enemy forc'd us into the Field. At pre&s;ent, if we make a Drawn Game of it, or procure but Mode|rate advantages, we are in a Condition which every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Heart mu&s;t tremble at the thought of. There are no &s;econd Tri|als, no Wars in re&s;erve, no new Schemes of Alliance to which we can have recour&s;e. Should the <HI>French</HI> King be able to bear down &s;uch an united Force as now makes head again&s;t him, at a time when <HI>Spain</HI> af|fords him no greater A&s;&s;i&s;tance; what will he do when the Trade of the <HI>Levant</HI> lies at
<PB N="4" REF="10">
his Mercy; when the whole Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> is &s;upply'd with his Manufactures, and the Wealth of the <HI>Indies</HI> flows into his Coffers; and what is yet wor&s;e, when this additional Strength mu&s;t ari&s;e in all its particulars from a proportionable Decay in the States that now make War upon him? It is no wonder therefore that our late King of Glorious Memory, who by the Confe&s;&s;ion of his greate&s;t Enemies, was a Prince that perfectly under&s;tood the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould in his la&s;t Speech recommend to his Parliament the declaring War again&s;t <HI>France</HI> in tho&s;e memorable Words: <HI>You have yet an Opportunity, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, to &s;ecure to you and your Po&s;terity the quiet Enjoyment of your Religion and Liberties, if you are not wanting to your &s;elves, but will exert the antient Vigour of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Nation: but I tell you plainly, my Opinion is, if you do not lay hold on this occa&s;ion, you have no rea&s;on to hope for another.</HI></P>
<P>We have already a dreadful Proof of the Increa&s;e of Power that accrues to <HI>France</HI> from its Conjunction with <HI>Spain.</HI> So expen&s;ive a War as that which the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy hath
<PB N="5" REF="11">
been carrying on in &s;o many and &s;o remote Parts at once, mu&s;t long &s;ince have drain'd and exhau&s;ted all its Sub&s;tance, had there not been &s;everal &s;ecret Springs, that &s;well'd their Trea&s;ury from time to time, in proportion as the War has &s;unk it. The King's Coffers have been often reduced to the lowe&s;t Ebb, but have &s;till been &s;ea|&s;onably refre&s;h'd by frequent and unexpected Supplies from the <HI>Spani&s;h America.</HI> We hear indeed of the Arrival but of very few Ships from tho&s;e Parts; but as in every Ve&s;&s;el there is Stowage for immen&s;e Trea&s;ures, when the Cargo is pure Bullion, or Merchandize of as great a Value; &s;o we find by Expe|rience they have had &s;uch prodigious Sums of Money convey'd to them by the&s;e &s;ecret Channels, that they have been enabled to pay more numerous Armies, than they ever had on foot before; and that at a time when their Trade fails in all its other Branches, and is di&s;tre&s;s'd by all the Arts and Con|trivances of their neighbouring Nations. Du|ring the la&s;t four Years, by a mode&s;t Com|putation there have been brought into <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> above &s;ix Millions of Pounds Sterling in Bullion. What then &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e wou'd
<PB N="6" REF="12">
be the effect of this Corre&s;pondence with <HI>America,</HI> might the Wealth of tho&s;e Parts come to them on Squadrons of Men of War, and Fleets of Galeons? If the&s;e little By|currents, that creep into the Country by Stealth, have &s;o great a Force, how &s;hall we &s;tem the whole Torrent, when it breaks in upon us with its full Violence? And this certainly will be our Ca&s;e, unle&s;s we find a Means to di&s;&s;olve the Union between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I have dwelt the longer on this Con&s;ideration, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent War hath already furni&s;h'd us with the Experiment, and &s;en&s;ibly convinc'd us of the Increa&s;e of Power, which <HI>France</HI> has receiv'd from its In|tercour&s;e with the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>As there are many who look upon every thing which they don't actually &s;ee and feel as bare Probability and Speculation, I &s;hall only touch on tho&s;e other Rea&s;ons of which we have already al&s;o had &s;ome Experience, for our preventing this Coalition of Intere&s;ts and De&s;igns in the two Monarchies.</P>
<P>The Woollen Manufacture is the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Strength, the &s;taple Commodity and pro|per Growth of our Country; if this fails us, our Trade and E&s;tates mu&s;t &s;ink together,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
and all the Ca&s;h of the Nation be con&s;umed on Foreign Merchandize. The <HI>French</HI> at pre&s;ent gain very much upon us in this great Article of our Trade, and &s;ince the Acce&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, &s;upply with Cloath of their own making the very be&s;t Mart we had in <HI>Europe.</HI> And what a melan|choly Pro&s;pect have we, if ever a Peace gives them leave to enrich their Manufacture with Mixtures of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool to multiply the Hands employ'd in it, to improve them&s;elves in all the Niceties of the Art, and to vend their Wares in tho&s;e Places where was the greate&s;t Con&s;umption of our Woollen Works, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Gain for the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Merchant. Notwith&s;tanding our many &s;ea&s;onable Recruits from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and our Plantations, we already complain of our want of Bullion; and mu&s;t at la&s;t be re|duc'd to the greate&s;t Exigencies, if this great Source be dry'd up, and our Traffick with <HI>Spain</HI> continue under its pre&s;ent Di&s;|couragement.</P>
<P>The Trade of the <HI>Levant</HI> mu&s;t likewi&s;e flouri&s;h or decay in our Hands, as we are Friends or Enemies of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monar|chy. The late Conque&s;t of <HI>Naples</HI> will
<PB N="8" REF="14">
very little alter the ca&s;e, though <HI>Sicily</HI> &s;hould follow the Fate of her Si&s;ter Kingdom. The <HI>Streight</HI>'s Mouth is the Key of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and will be always in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who are Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> We may only add, that the &s;ame Cau&s;es which &s;treighten the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce, will naturally enlarge the <HI>French;</HI> and that the Naval Force of either Nation will thrive or langui&s;h in the &s;ame degree as their Commerce gathers or lo&s;es Strength. And if &s;o powerful and populous a Nation as that of <HI>France</HI> be|come &s;uperior to us by Sea, our whole is lo&s;t, and we are no more a People. The Con&s;ideration of &s;o narrow a Channel be|twixt us, of &s;uch Numbers of regular Troops on the Enemy's &s;ide, of &s;o &s;mall a &s;tand|ing Force on our own, and that too in a Country de&s;titute of all &s;uch Forts and &s;trong Places as might &s;top the Progre&s;s of a victorious Army, hath &s;omething in it &s;o terrifying, that one does not care for &s;etting it in its proper Light. Let it not therefore enter into the Heart of any one that hath the lea&s;t Zeal for his Religion, or Love of Liberty, that hath any regard either to the Honour or Safety of his Country, or a well
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Wi&s;h for his Friends or Po&s;terity, to think of a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy be entirely torn from it, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> di&s;abled from ever giving the Law to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>French</HI> King would grant us the mo&s;t advantageous Terms we can de&s;ire; without the Separation of the two Monarchies they mu&s;t infallibly end in our De|&s;truction. Shou'd he &s;ecure to us all our pre|&s;ent Acqui&s;itions; &s;hou'd he add two or three Frontier-Towns to what we have already in <HI>Flanders;</HI> &s;hou'd he join the Kingdoms of <HI>Si|cily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia</HI> to <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Naples;</HI> &s;hou'd he leave King <HI>Charles</HI> in the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of <HI>Catalonia;</HI> &s;hou'd he make over to <HI>Great Britain</HI> the Town and Harbour of <HI>Ca|dis,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and at the &s;ame time re&s;ign his Conque&s;ts in <HI>Portugal;</HI> it wou'd all be of no effect towards the com|mon Safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> while the Bulk of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Continent, and the Riches of <HI>America</HI> remain in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bourbon</HI> Fa|mily.</P>
<P><HI>Boccalini</HI> when he weighs the States of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> in his Political Balance, after having laid <HI>France</HI> in one Scale, throws <HI>Spain</HI> into the
<PB N="10" REF="16">
other, which wanted but very little of being a Counter-poi&s;e. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this, &s;ays he, begun to promi&s;e them&s;elves the Ho|nour of the Ballance; reckoning that if <HI>Spain</HI> of it &s;elf weigh'd &s;o well, they cou'd not fail of Succe&s;s when the &s;everal Parts of the Monarchy were lump'd in the &s;ame Scale. Their Surpri&s;e was very great when upon the throwing in of <HI>Naples</HI> they &s;aw the Scale ri&s;e, and was greater &s;till when they found that <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> had the &s;ame effect. The truth of it is, the&s;e parts of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|narchy are rather for Ornament than Strength. They furni&s;h out Vice-royalties for the Gran|dees, and Po&s;ts of Honour for the Noble Fa|milies; but in a time of War are Incumbran|ces to the main Body of the Kingdom, and leave it naked and expos'd by the great num|ber of Hands they draw from it to their De|fence. Shou'd we therefore continue in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we have already made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters, with &s;uch Additions as have been mentioned, we &s;hou'd have little more than the Excre&s;cencies of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy. The Strength of it will &s;till join it &s;elf to <HI>France,</HI> and grow the clo&s;er to it by its Di&s;union from the re&s;t. And in this ca&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="17">
the Advantages which mu&s;t ari&s;e to that Peo|ple from their intimate Alliance with the re|maining part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions, wou'd in a very few Years not only repair all the Da|mages they have &s;u&s;tained in the pre&s;ent War, but fill the Kingdom with more Riches than it hath yet had in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Periods.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King hath often enter'd on &s;e|veral expen&s;ive Projects, on purpo&s;e to di&s;&s;i|pate the Wealth that is continually gathering in his Coffers in times of Peace. He hath employ'd immen&s;e Sums on Architecture, Gardening, Water-Works, Painting, Statua|ry, and the like, to di&s;tribute his Trea&s;ures among his People, as well as to humour his Plea&s;ures and his Ambition: But if he once engro&s;&s;es the Commerce of the <HI>Spani&s;h In|dies,</HI> whatever Quantities of Gold and Silver &s;tagnate in his private Coffers, there will be &s;till enough to carry on the Circulation among his Subjects. By this means in a &s;hort &s;pace of time he may heap up greater Wealth than all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> join'd together; and in the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of the World, Wealth and Power are but different Names for the &s;ame thing. Let us therefore &s;uppo&s;e that after eight or ten Years of Peace, he hath
<PB N="12" REF="18">
a mind to infringe any of his Treaties, or in|vade a neighbouring State; to revive the Pre|ten&s;ions of <HI>Spain</HI> upon <HI>Portugal,</HI> or attempt the taking tho&s;e Places which were granted us for our Security; what Re&s;i&s;tance, what Oppo&s;i|tion can we make to &s;o formidable an Ene|my? Shou'd the &s;ame Alliance ri&s;e again&s;t him that is now in War with him, what cou'd we hope for from it, at a time when the States engag'd in it will be comparatively weaken'd, and the Enemy who is now able to keep them at a &s;tand, will have receiv'd &s;o many new Acce&s;&s;ions of Strength.</P>
<P>But I think it is not to be imagin'd that in &s;uch a Conjuncture as we here &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ame Confederates, or any other of equal Force cou'd be prevail'd upon to join their Arms and endeavour at the pulling down &s;o exorbitant a Power. Some might be bought into his Intere&s;ts by Money, others drawn over by Fear, and tho&s;e that are liable to nei|ther of the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, might not think their own Intere&s;t &s;o much concern'd as in the pre&s;ent War; or if any appear'd in a di&s;|po&s;ition to enter into &s;uch a Confederacy, they might be cru&s;h'd &s;eparately before they cou'd concert Mea&s;ures for their mutual Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="19">
The keeping together of the pre&s;ent Al|liance can be a&s;cribed to nothing el&s;e but the clear and evident Conviction which every Member of it is under, that if it &s;hou'd once break without having had its effect, they can never hope for another Opportunity of reuni|ting, or of prevailing by all the joint Efforts of &s;uch an Union. Let us therefore agree on this as a fixt Rule, and an inviolable Maxim, never to lay down our Arms again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> till we have utterly disjoyn'd her from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy. Let this be the fir&s;t Step of a publick Treaty, the Ba&s;is of a general Peace.</P>
<P>Had the pre&s;ent War indeed run again&s;t us, and all our Attacks upon the Enemy been vain, it might look like a degree of Frenzy, or a Mixture of Ob&s;tinacy and De&s;pair, to be determin'd on &s;o impracticable an Underta|king. But on the contrary, we have already done a great part of our Work, and are come within view of the End that we have been &s;o long driving at. We remain victorious in all the Seats of War. In <HI>Flanders</HI> we have got into our hands &s;everal open Countries, rich Towns, and fortified Places. We have driven the Enemy out of all his Alliances, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t him of his Strong Holds, and
<PB N="14" REF="20">
ruin'd his Allies in <HI>Germany.</HI> We have not only recover'd what the Beginning of the War had taken from us, but po&s;&s;e&s;t our&s;elves of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Mi|lan,</HI> and an Avenue of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> War hath given us a Haven for our Ships, and the mo&s;t populous and wealthy Province of that Kingdom. In &s;hort, we have taken all the outlying parts of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, and made Impre&s;&s;ions upon the very Heart of it. We have beaten the <HI>French</HI> from all their advanc'd Po&s;ts in <HI>Europe,</HI> and driven them into their la&s;t Entrench|ments. One vigorous Pu&s;h on all &s;ides, one general A&s;&s;ault will force the Enemy to cry out for Quarter, and &s;urrender them&s;elves at di&s;cretion. Another <HI>Blenheim</HI> or <HI>Ramillies</HI> will make the Confederates Ma&s;ters of their own Terms, and Arbitrators of a Peace.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the Advantages already gain'd are very con&s;iderable if we pur&s;ue them, they will be of no effect unle&s;s we improve them towards the carrying of our main point. The Enemy &s;taggers; if you follow your Blow, he falls at your Feet; but if you allow him re&s;pite, he will recover his Strength, and come upon you with greater Fury. We have given
<PB N="15" REF="21">
him &s;everal repeated Wounds that have en|feebl'd him, and brought him low; but they are &s;uch as time will heal, unle&s;s you take advantage from his pre&s;ent Weakne&s;s to re|double your Attacks upon him. It was a cele|brated part in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Character, and what comes home to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that he thought nothing at all was done, while any thing remain'd undone. In &s;hort, we have been tugging a great while again&s;t the Stream, and have almo&s;t weather'd our point; a Stretch or two more will do the Work; but if in|&s;tead of that we &s;lacken our Arms, and drop our Oars, we &s;hall be hurried back in a mo|ment to the place from whence we fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>After having &s;een the Neece&s;&s;ity of an en|tire Separation of the Kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> our Subject naturally leads us into the Con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t proper means for effecting it.</P>
<P>We have a great while flatter'd our&s;elves with the pro&s;pect of reducing <HI>France</HI> to our own Terms by the want of Money among the People, and the Exigencies of the publick Trea&s;ury; but have been &s;till di&s;appointed by the great Sums imported from <HI>America,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="22">
and the many new Expedients which the Court hath found out for its Relief. A long con&s;umptive War is more likely to break the Grand Alliance, than di&s;able <HI>France</HI> from maintaining &s;ufficient Armies to oppo&s;e it. An arbitrary Government will never want Money; &s;o long as the People have it; and &s;o active a People will always have it, whil&s;t they can &s;end what Merchandi&s;es they plea&s;e to <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;ince their Alliance with <HI>Spain</HI> keep thirty Ships in con|&s;tant Motion between the We&s;tern Ports of <HI>France</HI> and the South Seas of <HI>America.</HI> The King him&s;elf is an Adventurer in this Traffick, and be&s;ides the Share that he receives out of the Gains of his Subjects, has immen&s;e Sums that come directly from it into his own Hands.</P>
<P>We may further con&s;ider, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;ince their abandoning <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> have very much retrench'd the Expence of the War, and lay out among them&s;elves all the Money that is con&s;umed in it.</P>
<P>Many are of Opinion, that the mo&s;t probable way of bringing <HI>France</HI> to Rea&s;on wou'd be by the making an Attempt upon the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and by that means to cut off all Com|munication
<PB N="17" REF="23">
with this great Source of Riches, or turn the Current of it into our own Coun|try. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s carries &s;o promi&s;ing an appearance, that I would by no means di&s;cou|rage the Attempt: But at the &s;ame time I think it &s;hould be a collateral Project, rather than our principal De&s;ign. Such an Undertaking (if well concerted, and put into good Hands) would be of infinite Advantage to the Common Cau&s;e: but certainly an Enter|pri&s;e that carries in it the Fate of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould not turn upon the Uncertainty of Winds and Waves, and be liable to all the Accidents that may befal a Naval Expedition.</P>
<P>Others there are that have long deceiv'd them&s;elves with the hopes of an In&s;urre|ction in <HI>France,</HI> and are therefore for laying out all our Strength on a De&s;cent. The&s;e, I think, do not enough con&s;ider the natural Love which the gro&s;s of Mankind have for the Con&s;titution of their Fathers. A Man that is not enlightned by Travail or Reflexion, grows as fond of Arbitrary Power, to which he hath been us'd from his Infancy, as of cold Climates or barren Countries, in which he hath been born and bred. Be&s;ides, there is a kind of &s;luggi&s;h Re&s;ignation, as well as
<PB N="18" REF="24">
poorne&s;s and degeneracy of Spirit, in a &s;tate of Slavery, that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of reco|vering them&s;elves out of it; as we find in Hi|&s;tory In&s;tances of Per&s;ons who after their Pri|&s;ons have been flung open, and their Fetters &s;truck off, have cho&s;en rather to langui&s;h in their Dungeons, than &s;take their mi&s;erable Lives and Fortunes upon the Succe&s;s of a Re|volution. I need not in&s;tance the general Fate of De&s;cents, the Difficulty of &s;upplying Men and Provi&s;ions by Sea again&s;t an Enemy that hath both at hand, and without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure tho&s;e Conque&s;ts that are often made in the fir&s;t On&s;ets of an Inva|&s;ion. For the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons I can never approve the nur&s;ing up Commotions and In&s;ur|rections in the Enemy's Country, which for want of the nece&s;&s;ary Support are likely to end in the Ma&s;&s;acre of our Friends and the Ruin of their Families.</P>
<P>The only means therefore for bringing <HI>France</HI> to our Conditions, and what appears to me, in all human probability, a &s;ure and in|fallible Expedient, is to throw in Multitudes upon 'em, and overpower 'em with Numbers, Would the Confederacy exert it &s;elf as much
<PB N="19" REF="25">
to annoy the Enemy, as they them&s;elves for their Defence, we might bear them down with the weight of our Armies, and in one Summer over&s;et the whole Power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Monarchy is already exhau&s;ted of its be&s;t and brave&s;t Subjects. The Flower of the Nation is con&s;um'd in its Wars: The Strength of their Armies con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of &s;uch as have &s;aved them&s;elves by flight from &s;ome or other of the victorious Confederates; and the only proper Per&s;ons to recruit them are but the Refu&s;e of tho&s;e who have been al|ready pick'd out for the Service. Mare&s;chal <HI>de Vauban,</HI> tho' infinitely partial in his Cal|culations of the Power of <HI>France,</HI> reckons that the Number of its Inhabitants was two Mil|lions le&s;s at the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> than in the beginning of the War that was there con|cluded: And tho' that War continued Nine Years, and this hath as yet la&s;ted but Six, yet con&s;idering that their Armies are more &s;trong and numerous; that there hath been much more Action in the pre&s;ent War; and that their Lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tain'd in it have been very ex|traordinary; we may, by a moderate Com|putation, &s;uppo&s;e that the pre&s;ent War hath not been le&s;s prejudicial than the foregoing
<PB N="20" REF="26">
one in the Ravage which it has made a|among the People. There is in <HI>France</HI> &s;o great a di&s;proportion between the number of Males and Females; and among the former, between tho&s;e who are capable of bearing Arms, and &s;uch as are too young, &s;ickly, or decrepit for the Service; and at the &s;ame time &s;uch va&s;t numbers of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, Se|cular and Religious, who live upon the La|bours of others, that when the &s;everal Trades and Profe&s;&s;ions are &s;upply'd, you will find mo&s;t of tho&s;e that are proper for War ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for filling up the laborious part of Life, and carrying on the Under|work of the Nation. They have already con|tributed all their &s;uperfluous Hands, and eve|ry new Levy they make mu&s;t be at the Ex|pence of their Farms and Vineyards, their Manufactures and Commerce.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Grand Alliance have innumerable Sources of Recruits, not only in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> but in all the populous parts of <HI>Germany</HI> that have little Trade or Manu|factures, in proportion to the number of their Inhabitants. We may add, that the <HI>French</HI> have only <HI>Switzerland,</HI> be&s;ides their own Country,
<PB N="21" REF="27">
to recruit in; and we know the Difficulties they meet with in getting thence a &s;ingle Regiment: Whereas the Allies have not only the &s;ame Re&s;&s;ource, but may be &s;upply'd for Mony from <HI>Denmark</HI> and other Neutral States. In &s;hort, the Confederates may bring to the Field what Forces they plea&s;e, if they will be at the charge of 'em: but <HI>France,</HI> let her Wealth be what it will, mu&s;t content her|&s;elf with the Product of her own Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are &s;till in greater &s;treights for Supplies of Hor&s;e than Men. The Breed of their Country is neither &s;o good nor nume|rous as what are to be found in mo&s;t of the Countries of the Allies. They had la&s;t Sum|mer about Three&s;core Thou&s;and in their &s;eve|ral Armies, and cou'd not perhaps bring into the Field 30000 more, if they were di&s;pos'd to make &s;uch an Augmentation.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e are not only few, but weak in compari&s;on of ours. Their Ca|valry in the Battle of <HI>Blenheim</HI> cou'd not &s;u&s;tain the Shock of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e. For this rea&s;on our late way of attacking their Troops Sword in Hand is very much to the Advantage of our Nation, as our Men are more robu&s;t, and our Hor&s;es of a &s;tronger
<PB N="22" REF="28">
Make than the <HI>French;</HI> and in &s;uch Attacks it is the Weight of the Forces, &s;uppo&s;ing equal Courage and Conduct, that will always carry it. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Strength turn'd very much to account in our Wars again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> of old, when we us'd to gall them with our long Bows, at a greater Di&s;tance than they could &s;hoot their Arrows: This Advantage we lo&s;t upon the Invention of Fire-Arms, but by the pre&s;ent Method our Strength as well as Bravery may again be of u&s;e to us in the Day of Battle.</P>
<P>We have very great Encouragement to &s;end what Numbers we are able into the Field, be|cau&s;e our Generals at pre&s;ent are &s;uch as are likely to make the be&s;t u&s;e of them, without throwing them away on any Ra&s;h Attempts or ill-concerted Projects. The Confederate Ar|mies have the Happine&s;s of being commanded by Per&s;ons who are e&s;teem'd the greate&s;t Lea|ders of the pre&s;ent Age, and are perhaps equal to any that have preceded them. There is a &s;ort of Re&s;emblance in their Characters; A particular Sedatene&s;s in their Conver&s;ation and Behaviour, that qualifies them for Coun|cil, with a great Intrepidity and Re&s;olution that fits them for Action. They are all of them
<PB N="23" REF="29">
Men of conceal'd Fire, that doth not break out with Noi&s;e and Heat in the ordinary Cir|cum&s;tances of Life; but &s;hews it &s;elf &s;ufficient|ly in all great Enterpri&s;es that require it. 'Tis true, the General upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> hath not had the &s;ame Occa&s;ions as the others to &s;igna|lize him&s;elf; but if we con&s;ider the great Vi|gilance, Activity and Courage, with the con|&s;ummate Prudence, and the nice &s;en&s;e of Ho|nour which appears in that Prince's Chara|cter, we have great rea&s;on to hope, that as he purcha&s;ed the fir&s;t Succe&s;s in the pre|&s;ent War, by forcing into the Service of the Confederates an Army that was rais'd again&s;t them in the very Heart of the Empire, he will give one of the fini&s;hing Strokes to it, and help to conclude the great Work which he &s;o happily begun. The &s;udden Check that he gave to the <HI>French</HI> Army the la&s;t Campaign, and the good Order he e&s;tabli&s;h'd in that of the <HI>Germans,</HI> look like happy Pre&s;ages of what we may expect from his Conduct. I &s;hall not pretend to give any Character of the Ge|nerals on the Enemy's &s;ide; but I think we may &s;ay this, that in the Eyes of their own Nation they are inferior to &s;everal that have formerly commanded the <HI>French</HI> Armies. If
<PB N="24" REF="30">
then we have greater Numbers than the <HI>French,</HI> and at the &s;ame time better Generals, it mu&s;t be our own Fault if we will not reap the Fruit of &s;uch Advantages.</P>
<P>It would be lo&s;s of Time to explain any further our Superiority to the Enemy in Num|bers of Men and Hor&s;e. We &s;ee plainly that we have the Means in our Hands, and that nothing but the Application of them is want|ing. Let us only con&s;ider what u&s;e the Ene|my would make of the Advantage we have mention'd if it fell on their &s;ide; and is it not very &s;trange that we &s;hou d not be as active and indu&s;trious for our Security, as they wou'd certainly be for our De&s;truction? But before we con&s;ider more di&s;tinctly the Method we ought to take in the Pro&s;ecution of the War, under this particular View, let us reflect a little upon tho&s;e we have already taken in the Cour&s;e of it for the&s;e &s;ix Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Allies after a &s;ucce&s;sful Summer are too apt upon the Strength of it to neglect their Preparations for the en&s;uing Campaign, while the <HI>French</HI> leave no Art nor Stratagem untried to fill up the empty Spaces of their Armies, and &s;well 'em to an equal Bulk with tho&s;e of the Confederates. By this means our Advantage
<PB N="25" REF="31">
is lo&s;t, and the Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> brought to a &s;econd Deci&s;ion. It is now become an Ob&s;er|vation that we are to expect a very indifferent Year after a very &s;ucce&s;sful one. <HI>Blenheim</HI> was follow'd by a Summer that makes no noi&s;e in the War. <HI>Ramillies, Turin,</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> were the Parents of our la&s;t Campaign. So many dreadful Blows allarm'd the Enemy, and rais'd their whole Country up in Arms. Had we on our &s;ide made proportionable Prepara|tions, the War by this time had been brought to a happy I&s;&s;ue. If after having gain'd the great Victories of <HI>Blenheim</HI> and <HI>Ramillies</HI> we had made the &s;ame Efforts as we &s;hould have done had we lo&s;t them, the Power of <HI>France</HI> could not have with&s;tood us.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Winter we u&s;ually get what Intelligence we can of the Force which the Enemy intends to employ in the Campaigns of the &s;ucceeding Year, and immediately ca&s;t about for a &s;ufficient number of Troops to face them in the Field of Battle. This, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, would be a good Method if we were engag'd in a Defen&s;ive War. We might maintain our Ground with an equal Number of Forces; but our Bu&s;ine&s;s is not only to &s;ecure what we are already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; we are to wre&s;t the
<PB N="26" REF="32">
whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy out of the Hands of the Enemy; and in order to it, to work our Way into the Heart of his Country by dint of Arms. We &s;hould therefore put forth all our Strength, and without having any Eye to his Preparations, make the greate&s;t Pu&s;h that we are able on our own &s;ide. We are told that the Enemy at pre&s;ent thinks of rai&s;ing Three|&s;core Thou&s;and Men for the next Summer; if we regulate our Levies in that View, we do nothing; let us perform our utmo&s;t, as they do, and we &s;hall overwhelm 'em with our Multitudes. We have it in our Power at lea&s;t to be four times as &s;trong as the <HI>French,</HI> but if Ten Men are in War with Forty, and the latter detatch only an equal Number to the Engagement, what Benefit do they receive from their Superiority?</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore to be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Confederates to turn to their Advantage their apparent Odds in Men and Hor&s;e; and by that means to out-number the Enemy in all Rencounters and Engagements. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on it mu&s;t be for the Intere&s;t of the Al|lies to &s;eek all Opportunities of Battle, be|cau&s;e all Lo&s;&s;es on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide are made up with infinitely more Difficulty than on ours;
<PB N="27" REF="33">
be&s;ides that the <HI>French</HI> do their Bu&s;ine&s;s by lying &s;till, and have no other Concern in the War than to hold fa&s;t what they have already got into their Hands.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;carriage of the noble&s;t Project that ever was form'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> can be a&s;crib'd to nothing el&s;e but our want of Numbers in the &s;everal Quarters of the War. If our Armies on all &s;ides had begun to bu&s;ie and in&s;ult the Enemy, at the &s;ame time that the Forces march'd out of <HI>Piemont, Toulon</HI> had been at pre&s;ent in the Hands of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> But could that Prince ever have imagin'd that the <HI>French</HI> would have been at liberty to de|tatch whole Armies again&s;t him? Or will it appear credible to Po&s;terity, that in a War carried on by the joint Force of &s;o many po|pulous and powerful Nations, <HI>France</HI> could &s;end &s;o great a part of its Troops to one Seat of the War, without &s;uffering in any of the re&s;t? Whereas it is well known, that if the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had continued before <HI>Toulon</HI> eight Days longer, he had been attack'd by an Army of Sixty Thou&s;and Men, which was more than double the Number of his own; and yet the Enemy was &s;trong enough every where el&s;e to prevent the Confederates from making any Im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="28" REF="34">
upon them. However, let us fall into the right Mea&s;ures, and we may hope that the Stroke is only deferr'd. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> hath &s;ecur'd a Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> and if the Allies make &s;uch Efforts in all Parts, as we may rea&s;onably expect from them, that Prince may &s;till make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the <HI>French</HI> Dominions on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>There is another part of our Conduct which may perhaps de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd. As &s;oon as we have agreed with the States Gene|ral upon any Augmentation of our Forces, we immediately negotiate with &s;ome or other of the <HI>German</HI> Princes, who are in the &s;ame Confederacy, to furni&s;h out our Quota in Mercenaries. This may be doubly prejudicial to the Alliance; Fir&s;t, as it may have an ill Influence on the Re&s;olutions of tho&s;e Princes in the Diet of the Empire, who may be wil|ling to &s;ettle as &s;mall a Quota as they can for them&s;elves, that they may have more Troops to hire out; and in the next place, as it may hinder them from contributing the whole Quota which they have &s;ettled. This actually happen'd in the la&s;t Campaign, when we are told the <HI>Germans</HI> excus'd them&s;elves for their
<PB N="29" REF="35">
want of Troops upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as having alrea|dy put mo&s;t of their Forces into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Service. Such an Excu&s;e, indeed, is very unju&s;t, but it would be better to give them no occa&s;ion of making it; and on &s;uch Occa&s;ions to con&s;ider what Men are apt to do, as well as what they may do with Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It might therefore be for our Advantage that all the Foreign Troops in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pay &s;hou'd be rais'd in Neutral Countries. <HI>Switzerland</HI> in particular, if timely applied to, might be of great u&s;e to us; not only in re&s;pect of the Reinforcements which we might draw from thence, but becau&s;e &s;uch a Draught of Forces would le&s;&s;en the Number of tho&s;e that might otherwi&s;e be employ'd in the <HI>French</HI> Service. The Bulk of our Levies &s;hou'd neverthele&s;s be rais'd in our own Country, it being impo&s;&s;ible for the Neutral States to furni&s;h both the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> with a &s;ufficient Number of effective Men; be&s;ides that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sol|diers will be more at the Di&s;po&s;al of their Ge|neral, and act with greater Vigour under the Conduct of one for whom they have &s;o ju&s;t a Value, and whom they do not con&s;ider only as their Leader, but as their Country-Man.
<PB N="30" REF="36">
We may likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e that the Soldiers of a Neutral State, who are not animated by any National Intere&s;t, cannot fight for Pay with the &s;ame Ardour and Alacrity, as Men that fight for their Prince and Country, their Wives and Children.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be worth while to con&s;ider whether the Military Genius of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation may not fall by degrees, and become inferior to that of our neighbouring States, if it hath no occa&s;ion to exert it &s;elf. Minds that are altogether &s;et on Trade and Profit, often contract a certain Narrowne&s;s of Tem|per, and at length become uncapable of great and generous Re&s;olutions. Shou'd the <HI>French</HI> ever make an unexpected De&s;cent upon us, we might want Soldiers of our own Growth to ri&s;e up in our Defence; and might not have time to draw a &s;ufficient Number of Troops to our Relief from the remote Corners of <HI>Germany.</HI> It is generally &s;aid, that if King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had made War upon <HI>France</HI> in the beginning of his Reign, he might have conquer'd it by the many Veterans which were &s;catter'd up and down this Kingdom, and had been inur'd to Service in the Civil Wars. It is to be hop'd we &s;hall never have &s;uch another Nur|&s;ery
<PB N="31" REF="37">
of Soldiers; but if the pre&s;ent War gives a more Military Turn to all other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> than to our own, it is to be fear'd we may lo&s;e in Strength, what we gain in Number. We may apply the &s;ame Con|&s;ideration nearer home. If all our Levies are made in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> may not tho&s;e two Parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchy, af|ter the disbanding of the pre&s;ent Army, be too powerful for the re&s;t, in ca&s;e of a Re|volt, tho', God be thank'd, we are not in any danger of one at pre&s;ent. However, as the&s;e Con&s;iderations don't concern the more e&s;&s;ential part of our De&s;ign, it is &s;ufficient have mention'd them.</P>
<P>The &s;paring of our &s;elves in &s;o important a Conjuncture, when we have but this &s;ingle Opportunity left for the pre&s;erving every thing that is pretious among&s;t us, is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Management that we can po&s;&s;ibly fall into. The good Husbandry of one Age may intail an endle&s;s Expence upon all Po&s;terity. We mu&s;t venture the &s;acrificing a part of our Lives and Fortunes at pre&s;ent, if we will effectually &s;e|cure both for the future. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King|dom is &s;o well &s;tock'd with People, and &s;o much abounds in Hor&s;e, that we have Power
<PB N="32" REF="38">
enough in our own Hands, did we make our utmo&s;t u&s;e of it, to humble <HI>France,</HI> and in a Campaign or two to put an end to the War.</P>
<P>There is not a more di&s;agreeable Thought to the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> than that of a &s;tanding Army. But if a Peace be made be|fore the Di&s;union of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> there are few, perhaps, that will not think the maintaining a &s;ettled Body of numerous Forces indi&s;pen&s;able for the Safety of our Country. We have it therefore in our Choice to rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;trong Reinforcement of Troops as at pre&s;ent may be &s;ufficient in Conjunction with tho&s;e of the Allies, for breaking the Strength of the Enemy; or when the Peace is conclu|ded, to keep on Foot &s;uch an Army as will be nece&s;&s;ary for preventing his Attempts up|on us.</P>
<P>It is to be hop'd that tho&s;e who wou'd be the mo&s;t zealous again&s;t keeping up a con|&s;tant Body of Regular Troops after a Gene|ral Peace, will the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves for the promoting an Augmentation of tho&s;e which are now on Foot; and by that means take care that we &s;hall not &s;tand in need of &s;uch an Expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="39">
We are indeed oblig'd by the pre&s;ent Situation of our Affairs to bring more Troops into the Field than we have yet done. As the <HI>French</HI> are retir'd within their Lines, and have collected all their Strength into a narrow Compa&s;s, we mu&s;t have greater Numbers to charge them in their Entrench|ments, and force them to a Battle. We &s;aw the la&s;t Campaign that an Army of Four&s;core Thou&s;and of the be&s;t Troops in <HI>Europe,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> at the Head of them, cou'd do nothing again&s;t an Enemy that were too numerous to be a&s;&s;aulted in their Camps, or attack'd in their Strong Holds.</P>
<P>There is another Con&s;ideration which de|&s;erves our utmo&s;t Attention. We know very well, that there is a Prince at the Head of a powerful Army, who may give a turn to the War, in which we are engag'd, if he thinks fit to &s;ide with either Party. I cannot pre|&s;ume to gue&s;s how far our Mini&s;ters may be inform'd of his De&s;igns: But unle&s;s they have very &s;trong A&s;&s;urances of his falling in with the Grand Alliance, or not oppo&s;ing it; they cannot be too circum&s;pect and &s;peedy in taking their Precautions again&s;t any contrary Re&s;olution. We &s;hall be unpardonable, if
<PB N="34" REF="40">
after &s;uch an Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure, we leave it in the power of any &s;ingle Prince to command a Peace, and make us accept what Conditions he thinks fit. It is certain, according to the Po&s;ture of our Affairs in the la&s;t Campaign, this Prince could have turn'd the Ballance on either &s;ide; but it is to be hop'd the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> will not de|pend any more on the Determination of one Man's Will. I don't &s;peak this becau&s;e I think there is any Appearance of that Prince's uniting him&s;elf to <HI>France.</HI> On the contrary, as he hath an extraordinary Zeal for the Re|form'd Religion, and great Sentiments of Ho|nour, I think it is not improbable we &s;hou'd draw him over to the Confederacy, if we pre&s;s him to it by proper Motives. His Love for Religion, and his Sen&s;e of Glory, will both have their effect on a Prince who hath already di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf by being a Patron of Pro|te&s;tants, and Guarantee of the <HI>We&s;tphalian</HI> Treaty. And if his Intere&s;t hath any part in his Actions, the Allies may make him greater Offers than the <HI>French</HI> King can do in the pre|&s;ent Conjuncture. There are large Extents of Dominion in the forfeited Principalities of the Empire; doubtful Succe&s;&s;ions to which
<PB N="35" REF="41">
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;eems to have very ju&s;t Preten&s;ions; and at the &s;ame time a great Title not yet di&s;pos'd of, and a Seat of War on the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> where none of our Generals have &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves. It would be Pre|&s;umption to be particular in any Propo&s;als on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; it is enough to have &s;hewn in general, that there are fair Opportunies, of which the Wi&s;dom of the Confederates may make u&s;e.</P>
<P>Common Sen&s;e will direct us, when we &s;ee &s;o warlike a Prince at the Head of &s;o great an Army hovering on the Borders of our Con|federates, either to obtain his Friend&s;hip, or &s;ecure our&s;elves again&s;t the Force of his Arms. We are &s;ure, whatever numbers of Troops we rai&s;e, we &s;hall have no Hands but what will turn to account. Nay, we are certain, that extraordinary Funds and Augmentations for one or two Campaigns may &s;pare us the Expence of many Years, and put an end to Taxes and Levies for a whole Age; whereas a long parcimonious War will drain us of more Men and Money, and in the end may prove ineffectual.</P>
<P>There is &s;till a great Popular Objection, which will be made to every thing that can
<PB N="36" REF="42">
be urg'd on this Subject. And indeed 'tis &s;uch a one as falls &s;o much in with the Pre|judices and little Pa&s;&s;ions of the Multitude, that when it is turn'd and &s;et off to advan|tage by ill-de&s;igning Men, it throws a Damp on the publick Spirit of the Nation, and gives a check to all generous Re&s;olutions for its Honour and Safety. In &s;hort, we are to be told, that <HI>England</HI> contributes much more than any other of the Allies, and that there|fore it is not rea&s;onable &s;he &s;hou'd make any Addition to her pre&s;ent Efforts. If this were true in Fact, I don't &s;ee any tolerable colour for &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion. Suppo&s;ing among a Multitude embarqu'd in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el there are &s;everal that in the fury of a Tempe&s;t will rather peri&s;h than work for their Pre|&s;ervation; wou'd it not be Madne&s;s in the re&s;t to &s;tand idle, and rather chu&s;e to &s;ink to|gether than do more than comes to their &s;hare? Since we are engag'd in a Work &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our Welfare, the Remi&s;ne&s;s of our Allies &s;hould be an Argument for us to redouble our Endeavours rather than &s;lacken them. If we mu&s;t govern our &s;elves by Example, let us rather imitate the Vigilance and Activity of the Common Enemy, than
<PB N="37" REF="43">
the Supinene&s;s and Negligence of our Friends.</P>
<P>We have indeed a much greater &s;hare in the War than any other part of the Confederacy. The <HI>French</HI> King makes at us directly, keeps a King by him to &s;et over us, and hath very lately augmented the Salary of his Court, to let us &s;ee how much he hath that De&s;ign at heart. Few of the Nations in War with him, &s;hou'd they ever fall into his hands, wou'd lo&s;e their Religion or Form of Govern|ment, or interfere at pre&s;ent with him in matters of Commerce. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are likely to be the greate&s;t Lo&s;ers after the <HI>Bri|tains,</HI> have but little Trade to the <HI>Levant</HI> in compari&s;on with ours, have no con&s;iderable Plantations or Commerce in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or any Woollen-Manufactures for <HI>Spain;</HI> not to mention the &s;trong Barrier they have al|ready purchas'd between <HI>France</HI> and their own Country.</P>
<P>But after all, every Nation in the Confe|deracy makes the &s;ame Complaint, and fancys it&s;elf the greate&s;t Sufferer by the War. Indeed in &s;o common a Pre&s;&s;ure, let the Weight be never &s;o equally di&s;tributed, eve|ry one will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of that part which lies on his own Shoulders. We fur|ni&s;h,
<PB N="38" REF="44">
without di&s;pute, more than any other Branch of the Alliance: but the que&s;tion is, whether others do not exert them&s;elves in pro|portion according to their re&s;pective Strength. The Emperor, the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the Ele|ctor of <HI>Hannover,</HI> as well as the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;eem at lea&s;t to come up to us. The greate&s;t Powers in <HI>Germany</HI> are borrowing Mony where they can get it, in order to maintain their &s;tated Quota's, and go thorough their part of the Ex|pence: and  f any of the Circles have been negligent, they have paid for it much more in their late Contributions, than what wou'd have furni&s;h'd out their Share in the common Charges of the War.</P>
<P>There are others who will object the Po|verty of the Nation, and the Difficulties it wou'd find in furni&s;hing greater Supplies to the War than it doth at pre&s;ent. To this we might an&s;wer, that if the Nation were really as poor as this Objection makes it, it &s;hou'd be an Argument for enforcing rather than dimini&s;hing our pre&s;ent Efforts again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> The &s;inking our Taxes for a few Years wou'd be only a temporary Relief, and in a little time occa&s;ion far greater Impo&s;i|tions,
<PB N="39" REF="45">
than tho&s;e which are now laid upon us. Whereas the &s;ea&s;onable Expence of part of our Riches, will not only pre&s;erve the re&s;t; but by the right u&s;e of them pro|cure va&s;t Additions to our pre&s;ent Stock. It may be nece&s;&s;ary for a Per&s;on langui&s;hing un|der an ill Habit of Body to lo&s;e &s;everal Oun|ces of Blood, notwith&s;tanding it will weaken him for a time, in order to put a new Fer|ment into the remaining Ma&s;s, and draw into it fre&s;h Supplies.</P>
<P>But we can by no means make this Con|ce&s;&s;ion, to tho&s;e who &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly publi&s;h the Nation's Poverty. Our Country is not only rich, but abounds in Wealth much more than any other of the &s;ame Extent in <HI>Europe-France,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Goodne&s;s of its Climate, the Fertility of its Soil, the Multi|tude of its Inhabitants, its convenient Har|bours, both for the <HI>Ocean</HI> and <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and its pre&s;ent Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> is not to compare with <HI>Great Britain</HI> in this particular. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe word for word the Pa&s;&s;age of a late celebrated <HI>French</HI> Author, which will lay this Matter in its full light; and leave the Reader to make the counter-part of the Parallel between the two Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"According to all the Inquiries that I have been able to make during &s;everal Years, in which I have apply'd my &s;elf to this &s;ort of Remarks, I have ob&s;erv'd, that about a Tenth part of the People of this King|dom are reduc'd to Beggary, and are a|ctual Beggars. That among the Nine other parts, Five are not in a condition to give Alms or Relief to tho&s;e aforemention'd, being very near reduc'd them&s;elves to the &s;ame mi&s;erable Condition. Of the Four other remaining Parts, Three are very unea&s;y in their Circum&s;tances, and embara&s;s'd with Debts and Law-Suits. In the Tenth part, I reckon the Soldiers, Lawyers, Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, Merchants and &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens, which cannot make up more than a Hundred Thou&s;and Fami|lies. And I believe I &s;hould not be mi&s;taken, if I &s;hou'd &s;ay, that there are not above Ten Thou&s;and of the&s;e Families, who are very much at their ea&s;e: and if out of the&s;e Ten Thou&s;and we &s;hou'd take the Men that are employ'd in Publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, with their Dependents and Adhe|rents, as al&s;o tho&s;e whom the King &s;up|ports by his Bounty, with a few Mer|chants,
<PB N="41" REF="47">
the number of tho&s;e who remain will be &s;urpri&s;ingly little." <BIBL><HI>Dixme Royale.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>What a dreadful Account is this of Nine|teen Millions of People; for &s;o many the Au|thor reckons in that Kingdom. How can we &s;ee &s;uch a Multitude of Souls ca&s;t under &s;o many Subdivi&s;ions of Mi&s;ery, without re|flecting on the Ab&s;urdity of a Form of Go|vernment that &s;acrifices the Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s of &s;o many rea&s;onable Beings to the Glory of one of their Fellow-Creatures. But this is not our Affair at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If we run over the other Nations of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> that have any part in the pre&s;ent War, we &s;hall only pa&s;s through &s;o many different Scenes of Poverty. <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> are reduc'd to great Extremities. <HI>Ger|many</HI> is exhau&s;ted to the la&s;t degree in many parts of it, and in others plundered of all &s;he had left. <HI>Holland</HI> indeed flouri&s;hes a|bove the re&s;t in Wealth and Plenty: But if we con&s;ider the infinite Indu&s;try and Penuri|ou&s;ne&s;s of that People, the Coar&s;ene&s;s of their Food and Raiment, their little Indulgences of Plea&s;ure and Exce&s;s, it is no wonder that not|with&s;tanding they furni&s;h as great Taxes as their Neighbours, they make a better figure
<PB N="42" REF="48">
under them. In a Commonwealth there are not &s;o many overgrown E&s;tates as in Monar|chies, the Wealth of the Country is &s;o equal|ly di&s;tributed, that mo&s;t of the Community are at their Ea&s;e, though few are plac'd in extraordinary Points of Splendour and Magni|ficence. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Circum|cum&s;tances may very much contribute to the &s;eeming Pro&s;perity of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> we know they are indebted many Millions more than their whole Republick is worth, and if we con&s;ider the variety of Taxes and Impo&s;itions they groan under at a time when their private Di&s;&s;en&s;ions run high, and &s;ome of the wealthie&s;t parts of the Government re|fu&s;e to bear their &s;hare in the publick Expence, we &s;hall not think the Condition of that Peo|ple &s;o much to be envied as &s;ome among&s;t us would willingly repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>Nor is <HI>Great Britain</HI> only rich as &s;he &s;tands in compari&s;on with other States, but is really &s;o in her own intrin&s;ick Wealth. She had never more Ships at Sea, greater quantities of Merchandi&s;e in her Warehou&s;es, larger Re|ceipts of Cu&s;tomes, or more numerous Com|modities ri&s;ing out of her Manufactures than &s;he has at pre&s;ent. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;its in the
<PB N="43" REF="49">
mid&s;t of a mighty Affluence of all the Nece&s;|&s;aries and Conveniencies of Life. If our Sil|ver and Gold dimini&s;hes, our publick Credit continues unimpair'd, and if we are in want of Bullion, it lies in our own power to &s;up|ply our &s;elves. The old <HI>Roman</HI> General, when he heard his Army complain of Thir&s;t, &s;hew'd 'em the Springs and Rivers that lay be|hind the Enemy's Camp. It is our own ca&s;e: The Rout of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army would make us Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>If Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> takes upon him the Com|mand of the Confederate Forces in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and meets with that Support from the Al|liance which they are capable of giving him, we have a fair Pro&s;pect of reducing <HI>Spain</HI> to the entire Obedience of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria.</HI> The <HI>Sile&s;ian</HI> Fund (to the immortal Reputation of tho&s;e generous Patriots who were concern'd in it) enabled that Prince to make a Conque&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> at a time when our Affairs were more de&s;perate there, than they are at pre&s;ent in the Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When our Parliament has done their ut|mo&s;t, another publick &s;pirited Project of the &s;ame nature, which the Common Enemy cou'd not fore&s;ee nor prepare again&s;t, might in all
<PB N="44" REF="50">
probability &s;et King <HI>Charles</HI> upon the Throne for which he hath &s;o long contended. One pitcht Battle wou'd determine the Fate of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Continent.</P>
<P>Let us therefore exert the united Strength of our whole I&s;land, and by that means put a new Life and Spirit into the Confederates, who have their Eyes fixt upon us, and will abate or increa&s;e their Preparations according to the Example that is &s;et them. We &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Augmentation if we intend to bring the Enemy to Rea&s;on, or re&s;cue our Country from the Mi&s;eries that may befal it; and we find our &s;elves in a condition of making &s;uch an Aug|mentation as, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, can|not but prove effectual. If we carry it on vigorou&s;ly we &s;hall gain for our &s;elves and our Po&s;terity a long a glorious and a la&s;ting Peace; but if we neglect &s;o fair an Opportunity, we may be willing to employ all our Hands, and all our Trea&s;ures when it will be too late, and &s;hall be tormented with one of the mo&s;t me|lancholy Reflexions of an afflicted Heart, That it was once in our Power to have made our &s;elves and our Children happy.</P>
