<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following POEMS, wrote by THOMAS ELLWOOD, (which have lain dormant in <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> for many Years) being lately communica|ted to me by a Friend, I thereupon gave them a &s;erious Peru&s;al; and ob&s;erving the pious and religious Sentiments wherewith they abound, thought they were too good <HI>to be lo&s;t</HI>; e&s;pecially as there is room to hope, the uncaptious and &s;incerely religious Youth of either Sex, may be benefit|ted thereby.</P>
