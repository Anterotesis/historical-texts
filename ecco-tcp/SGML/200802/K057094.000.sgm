<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Archbi&s;hop ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>GEORGE ABBOT, was born October 29th, 1562, at Guildford, in Surrey, of very wor|thy parents, remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;teady zeal for the Prote&s;tant Religion, for their living long, and happily together, and for their &s;ingular felicity in their children.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Maurice Abbot, was by trade a Clothworker, and &s;ettled at the town of Guildford, in Surrey, where he married his wife Alice March, and &s;uffered for his &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in the Prote&s;tant Religion, through the means of Dr. Story, who was a great per&s;ecutor of &s;uch per&s;ons in the reign of Queen Mary. But the&s;e &s;torms being blown over, they pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of their days quietly, living together fifty-eight years. She decea&s;ed September 15, 1606, and he September 25, the &s;ame year, the former being eighty, and the latter eighty-&s;ix years of age. They left behind them &s;ix &s;ons, of whom Robert the elde&s;t, was then one of the King's chaplains, George, had been thrice vice-chancellor of Oxford, and their younge&s;t &s;on Mau|rice, was at this time an eminent merchant of the city of London.</NOTE></P>
<P>While his mother was pregnant with this &s;on, &s;he is &s;aid to have had a dream which proved at once an omen, and an in&s;trument of his future fortunes. Her dream was this. She fancied &s;he was told in her
<PB N="2" REF="6">
&s;leep that if &s;he could eat a Jack, or Pike, the child &s;he went with would prove a &s;on, and ri&s;e to great preferment. Not long after this, in taking a pail of water out of the river Wey, which ran by their hou&s;e, &s;he accidentally caught a Jack, and had thus, an odd opportunity of fulfilling her dream. This &s;tory being much talked of, and coming to the ears of &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, they offered to be|come &s;pon&s;ors for the child, which was kindly accept|ed, and they had the goodne&s;s to afford many te&s;ti|monies of their affection to their god&s;on while at &s;chool, and after he was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity. Such was the good effects of his mother's dream.</P>
<P>When he was grown up to an age proper for re|ceiving the fir&s;t tincture of learning, he was &s;ent with his elder brother Robert to the free &s;chool, erected in their native town of Guildford, by K. Edward VI; and having pa&s;&s;ed thro' the rudiments of Literature, under the care of Mr. Francis Taylor, who had then the direction of that &s;chool, he was in 1578 removed to the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and entered a &s;tudent in Baliol College. On November the 29th, 1583, being then bachelor of arts, he was elected probationer fellow of his college; and afterwards proceeding in the faculty of arts, he entered into holy orders, and became a celebrated preacher in the univer&s;ity. He commenced bachelor of divinity in 1593, and pro|ceeded doctor in that faculty, in May, 1597: and in the month of September, of the &s;ame year, he was elected ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity College. About this time it was, that the fir&s;t differences began between him and Dr. Laud, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted as long as they lived, and was the cau&s;e of great unea&s;ine&s;s to both. On March 6, 1599, he was in&s;talled dean of Win|che&s;ter, in the room of Dr. Martin Heton, who was
<PB N="3" REF="7">
preferred to the bi&s;hoprick of Ely: Dr. Abbot be|ing then about thirty-&s;even years of age.</P>
<P>In 1600, he was vice-chancellor of the Univer&s;i|ty of Oxford, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf while in that high office, by the opinion he gave with re&s;pect to the &s;etting up again the cro&s;s in Cheap&s;ide, about which there were great di&s;putes, but in the end he carried his point again&s;t Dr. Bancroft, then Bi&s;hop of London, and afterwards Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury; which gained him great reputation as appears by a tract publi&s;hed on that &s;ubject.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>The cro&s;s at Cheap&s;ide was taken down in the year 1600, in order to be repaired, and upon this occa&s;ion, the citizens of London de&s;ired the advice of both univer&s;ities on this que&s;tion; Whether the &s;aid cro&s;s &s;hould be re-erected or not? and Dr. Abbot, as vice-chancellor of Oxford, gave it as his opinion, that the crucifix with the dove upon it &s;hould not be again &s;et up, but approved rather of a pyramid, or &s;ome other matter of mere ornament, for the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned in his letter. In this determination he acted con&s;i&s;tently with his own practice, when in his &s;aid office he cau&s;ed &s;everal &s;uper&s;titious pictures to be burnt at the market-place of Oxford, and among the re&s;t, one in which was the figure of God the Father, over a crucifix, ready to receive the Soul of Chri&s;t; and he profe&s;&s;es in this letter, that he was moved to &s;uch proceedings by his own ob|&s;ervation and experience. <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">I remember, &s;ays he, in that col|lege (Baliol) where I fir&s;t lived, a young man was taken pray|ing, and beating his brea&s;t, before a crucifix in a window; which cau&s;ed the ma&s;ter and fellows, to pull it down, and &s;et up other gla&s;s. Which example, makes me nothing doubt, but that the cro&s;s in Cheap&s;ide hath many in the twilight and morning early, who do reverence before it, be&s;ides Cam|pian, who&s;e act is famous, or rather infamous, for it. And, I am informed, that &s;o much hath been &s;ignified by the neighbours, or inque&s;t, making pre&s;entments concerning the circum&s;tances of this cau&s;e. By all which, I do conclude, that it is a monument of their &s;uper&s;tition; a great induce|ment, and may be a ready way to idolatry; and that there can be no tolerable u&s;e of this matter, which may be able to countervail the dangers and obloquy ari&s;ing upon the retain|ing of it; and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e it is perceived that many evil affected men do make their advantage from hence, to in&s;inuate into the minds of their credulous hearers, that it is a token of the return of their faith again into this land, &s;ince their monuments are not extingui&s;hed in the chief &s;treet of our greate&s;t city.</P>
</LETTER> He afterwards de&s;ires, that the reader would ob&s;erve, he &s;ays, the magi&s;trates are to redre&s;s &s;uch enormities: <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">For, continues he, I do not permit inferior men to run headlong about &s;uch matters; and to rend, break, and tear, as well within, as without the churches; which was that which Luther reprehended, but the advice and con&s;ent of &s;uperior powers is to be had herein, that all things may be done decently and in order.</P>
</LETTER> He held it therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould apply to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury (Whit|gift) and to the Bi&s;hop of London (Bancroft) for in&s;tructions. The i&s;&s;ue of the matter was, that the cro&s;s only was erected again, without either the body, or the dove, which was agree|able in the main to the &s;entiments of the vice-chancellor, and the heads of hou&s;es at Oxford.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">
In 1603, he was again cho&s;en vice-chancellor of the univer&s;ity, and di&s;charged that office a &s;econd time with general approbation. In 1605, he was a third time vice-chancellor. In the &s;ucceeding year, he is &s;aid to have had a great &s;hare in the troubles of Laud, who was called to an account by the vice-chan|cellor, Dr. Ayry, for a Sermon of his preached before the univer&s;ity; and that year likewi&s;e, he lo&s;t his father and mother.</P>
<P>In 1608, died his great patron Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dor&s;et, Lord High Trea&s;urer of England, and Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, &s;udden|ly at the council table, at who&s;e funeral, Dr. Abbot preached a &s;ermon, which was afterwards printed, and generally commended. After his decea&s;e, Dr. Abbot became chaplain to George Hume, Earl of Dunbar, and Trea&s;urer of Scotland, one of King James's early favourites, and who had all along had
<PB N="5" REF="9">
a very high &s;hare in his e&s;teem, and with him he went this year into Scotland, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the exe|cution of a very important de&s;ign, for e&s;tabli&s;hing an union between the Churches in that kingdom, and this, wherein he behaved with &s;o much prudence and moderation, as gained him a very high character, and is thought to be the fir&s;t &s;tep to all his future preferments.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>There is no point in which all the writers who mention this Prelate, more clearly agree, than in this, that his journey to Scotland, brought him into that height of favour with the King, which &s;o &s;uddenly rai&s;ed him in little more than three years, from Dean of Winche&s;ter, to Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; yet it has &s;o fallen out, that hitherto, his tran&s;actions in Scotland have lain &s;o much in the dark, that it is a very difficult thing to di&s;cern how he merited by them, &s;o high a &s;hare of the Royal favour. To explain therefore this hitherto untouched point, and &s;et this matter in a clear light, &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this note, the rather becau&s;e it will &s;hew how unju&s;tly this great man has been charged with unfriendline&s;s to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of England, and coldne&s;s in regard to the Hie|rarchy. King James had &s;uffered &s;o much before his acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of England, from the &s;pirit and power of the Pre&s;byterians in Scotland, that he was greatly &s;et on re&s;toring the ancient form of government by Bi&s;hops in that kingdom; the care of which was principally entru&s;ted to the Earl of Dun|bar, to whom Dr. Abbot was now chaplain. That noble Lord, who is by all writers allowed to have been both the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t man of all the favourites of that nation, had proceeded &s;o far in this matter two years before, as to obtain an act for the re&s;titution of the e&s;tates of Bi&s;hops, but the Pre&s;byterians made &s;o &s;teady a re&s;i&s;tance, that the con&s;equences which were hoped from the re&s;toring of that order, were in the utmo&s;t danger of being di&s;appointed. But by the &s;kill and prudence, the &s;ound &s;en&s;e, and great moderation of Dr. Abbot, the&s;e difficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ties were removed, and the clergy of Scotland, who had refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to admit the Bi&s;hops for their moderators in their church &s;ynods, were brought to a better temper, and things put into &s;uch a train, as afterwards produced the entire e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Epi&s;copal Order in Scotland; for which the King had been &s;o long &s;truggling, and to &s;o little purpo&s;e. The account given by the famous hi&s;torian of the Church of Scotland, (David Calderwood) &s;ufficiently proves the truth of what has been a&s;&s;|erted. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'About the end of June, (1608) &s;ays he, the Earl of Dunbar came from court, and with him two Engli&s;h Doctors, Abbot and Higgins. Dr. Maxy, one of the King's chaplains came by &s;ea. It was reported that no &s;mall &s;ums of money were &s;ent down with him, to be di&s;tributed among the mini&s;t|ers and &s;ome others. The Engli&s;h doctor &s;eemed to have no other direction, but to per&s;uade the Scots that there was no &s;ub&s;tantial difference in religion, between the two realms, but only in things indifferent, concerning government and ceremonies: and to report, that it was his maje&s;ty's will, that England &s;hould &s;tand as he found it, and Scotland as he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ft it. But when he came to St. Andrews, Mr. Robert Howie, a man of a &s;editious and turbulent &s;pirit, declaimed again&s;t the di&s;cipline and government of our Kirk; and then they utter|ed their mind in plain terms: no order was taken with &s;o manife&s;t a breach, after the la&s;t conference. This was the policy of the a&s;piring Bi&s;hops, to cry peace, peace, and to crave &s;ilence of their oppo&s;ites; when, in the mean time, they minded not to be &s;ilent them&s;elves, when they found occa&s;ion.'</Q> This very clearly proves, that it was by a kind and moderate, not a haughty and &s;evere, behaviour, that the Engli&s;h doctor, as he calls Dean Abbot, won &s;o much upon the Scots mini&s;ters, as to bring them into a compliance with the King's de&s;ires; &s;o that in two years afterwards, the Lord High Trea&s;urer, Dunbar, who was entirely governed in this matter by the advice of his able chaplain, procured an act in the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly, by which it was provided. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King &s;hould have the Indiction (or calling) of all General A&s;&s;emblies. That the Bi&s;hops, or their deputies &s;hould be perpetual Mo|derators of the dioce&s;an &s;ynods. That no excommunication, or ab&s;olution, &s;hould be pronounced without their approbation. That all pre&s;entations of benefices &s;hould be made by them; and that the deprivation or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
mini&s;ters &s;hould be|long to them. That every mini&s;ter at his admi&s;&s;ion to a be|nefice, &s;hould take the oath of &s;upremacy, and canonical o|bedience. That the vi&s;itation of the dioce&s;e, &s;hall be per|formed by the Bi&s;hop or his deputy only. And finally, that the Bi&s;hop &s;hould be moderator of all conventions, for exer|ci&s;ings or prophe&s;yings, which &s;hould be held within their bounds.'</Q> All which were afterwards ratified and confirmed by authority of the parliament of that kingdom. Such were the merits of Dr. Abbot in this re&s;pect, and &s;o great ju&s;tice was there done to them by his noble patron, the Trea&s;urer, in the report he made to his maje&s;ty, of the Dean's behaviour in this re&s;pect, that, in conjunction with the &s;ervice rendered his maje&s;ty, by giving his unque&s;tioned te&s;timony in the affair of Gowry's con&s;piracy, (of which a full account &s;hall be given in the &s;ucceeding note) he was rai&s;ed &s;o high, and &s;o firmly fixed in the e&s;teem of his royal ma&s;ter, as that no oppo&s;ition could prevent his arriving at the &s;upreme dignity in his profe&s;&s;ion. As a proof of his advancing his fortune by this means, and not otherwi&s;e, it may not be ami&s;s to tran&s;cribe the ob&s;ervation of a contemporary hi&s;torian, (Speed) after Dr. Abbot was rai&s;ed to the archiepi&s;copal dignity, who tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the fir&s;t preacher, and the fir&s;t in that emba&s;&s;age, which King James &s;ent into Scotland, to e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e neighbouring Churches, was he, who&s;e eminency both for place and piety, is now worthily foremo&s;t in guiding our own; and who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed travels in that &s;ervice, as they were acceptable to God, his maje&s;ty, and that nation; &s;o are they a document to others, how powerful and admirably &s;ucce&s;sful true learning is, where it is guided with true prudence; and where piety and the love of God's glory, is linked with charity and zeal of man's good.'</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10">
While he was at Edinburgh upon this occa&s;ion, a
<PB N="7" REF="11">
pro&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t one George Sprot, Notary of Aymouth, for having been con|cerned in Gowry's con&s;piracy eight years before, for which he was tried before Sir William Hart, Lord Ju&s;tice General of Scotland, condemned and execu|ted. A large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge, and a narrative prefixed thereto, by Dr. Abbot, who had been eye-witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;ed, and this was publi&s;hed at London, in order to &s;ettle the minds of the people, with regard to that con&s;piracy; which had hitherto been looked upon as a very my&s;terious affair, and about the reality of which there had been very great doubts.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>There had been very great doubts.</HI>] It is a difficult thing to give a clear account of this matter, within the &s;hort compa&s;s of a note; and yet the importance, as well as curio&s;ity of the &s;ubject, very ob&s;curely treated by mo&s;t of our hi&s;torians, as well as its clo&s;e connection with the hi&s;tory of Dean Abbot's life, render it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The con&s;piracy was framed by John, Earl of Gowry, &s;on to that Earl of Gowry, who had been executed for &s;urprizing the King's per&s;on at Ruthen Ca&s;t|le, in 1584; and carried on with great diligence and &s;eerecy. The Scheme was to invite the King, upon &s;ome pretence or other, to the Earl's hou&s;e at Perth, and there to make &s;ure of him. This de&s;ign was executed on Tue&s;day Augu&s;t 5, 1600, when the King was brought thither by Mr. Alexander Ruthen, brother to the Earl, accompanied by &s;ome per&s;ons of quality, under pretence of &s;eeing &s;ome chymical experiment; and for this purpo&s;e after dinner, being brought to a chamber at the top of the hou&s;e, Mr. Alexander Ruthen &s;hut the door, and &s;uddenly fell to upbraiding the King with the death of his father, for which he was now to make &s;atisfaction; and, after this &s;peech, left him for &s;ome time to the mercy of the execu|tioner, who refu&s;ed to do that office, though Alexander return|ing had, if this man had not hindered him; but the King with much &s;truggling got at la&s;t to a window, and cried out &s;o loud, that the lords and gentlemen of his retinue heard him, and came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the Earl him&s;elf was killed by Sir Thomas Ere&s;kine, the captain of the King's guard, as he was going to help his brother, and Alexander Ruthen was di&s;patch|ed by Ram&s;ay, one of the King's pages, who being well ac|quainted with the hou&s;e, came by the back-&s;tairs time enough to pre&s;erve his ma&s;ter. When the mini&s;ters of Edinburgh were de&s;ired to a&s;&s;emble the people, and give God thanks for this deliverance, they excu&s;ed them&s;elves, as not acquainted with the particulars; and when they were pre&s;&s;ed only to make known to the people, that the King had e&s;caped a great danger, and to excite them to thanksgiving:&mdash;they an&s;wered, that they were not very well &s;atisfied, as to the truth of the matter; and that nothing was to be uttered in the pulpit, but that which might be &s;poke in faith. Upon this, the council order|ed the Bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s to a&s;&s;emble the people, to declare the whole affair, and to make a prayer of thank&s;giving, which was done accordingly. In November following, a parliament was held at Edinburgh, in which the e&s;tate of Gowry was confi&s;|cated, the whole family attainted; and the 5th of Augu&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by act of parliament, for a day of thank&s;giving in all &s;ucceeding times. After King James's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England, he appointed a weekly commemoration, by a Tue&s;day's &s;ermon at court: and now, on the execution of this Sprot, an account of his &s;hare in the con&s;piracy was publi&s;hed, with a preface to the reader, &s;ub&s;cribed by Dr. Abbot, and full as large as the account it&s;elf. As this little tract is become very &s;carce, it may not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from it, in order to &s;et this matter in a clearer light. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There are few in this i&s;land, &s;ays he, of any under&s;tanding, but have heard of the traiterous, and bloody attempt of the Earl Gowrie and his brother, again&s;t the per&s;on and life, of our mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Sovereign. Wherein albeit there were &s;uch evidences, and arguments, as that any man who would have taken notice thereof, might have been &s;ufficiently informed therein, even at the very fir&s;t, and afterward, by the clear depo&s;itions (for mo&s;t pregnant circum&s;tances) and ample atte&s;tations of many per&s;ons of honour, and quality; the parliament of that king|dom took full knowledge thereof, and accordingly proceeded to the forfeiting of the whole e&s;tate of that Earl, and of his heirs for ever: yet &s;ome humorous men, whom in that re&s;pect, I may ju&s;tly term unthankful unto God, and undutiful to their King, out of fond imaginations, or rather, if you will, &s;e|ditious &s;uppo&s;itions of their own, did both at home and abroad, by whi&s;perings and &s;ecret buzzings into the ears of the people, (who were better per&s;uaded of them than indeed there was cau&s;e) employ their wits and tongues, to ob&s;cure the truth of that matter, and to ca&s;t an imputation where it was lea&s;t de&s;erved. Which, when God had permitted, for the &s;pace of &s;ome years to ranckle and fe&s;ter in the bowels of tho&s;e who were the authors of it; the &s;ame God, in his wi&s;|dom, at la&s;t meaning to cure them, if they would be cured, of that malady, di&s;covered that in the &s;ame trea&s;on, although carried never &s;o &s;ecretly, there were other confederates, of whom hitherto the world had taken no kind of knowledge. And albeit two of the per&s;ons intere&s;ted in that bu&s;ine&s;s, were lately dead, and departed unto far greater torment, than all the earth could lay upon them, (unle&s;s they died repentant) yet it was apprehended, that a third party remained, who had foreknowledge of that con&s;piracy, and was able to utter much of the &s;ecrets of it: one George Sprot, a notary, inhabiting at Ayemouth, a place well known in that county. Which matter, or &s;ome part thereof, being made known to an honour|able per&s;on, [the Earl of Dunbar] a mo&s;t faithful &s;ervant to His Maje&s;ty: fir&s;t, by &s;ome words that fell from Sprot him&s;elf, and afterwards, by &s;ome papers found upon him; it was &s;o wi&s;ely carried, and &s;o prudently brought about, by the great care and diligence of that nobleman (God Almighty ble&s;&s;ing the bu&s;ine&s;s) that &s;o much was revealed, as followeth in this treati&s;e, upon the acts to be &s;een, which are here &s;et down at large, word for word, as they agree with the proce&s;s origi|nal, and other examinations, that &s;uch as have been aver&s;e, may at la&s;t receive &s;atisfaction. Touching all which I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but only report that which befel upon the day of his death, when he &s;uffered for that trea&s;on. Having then the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on him, upon Friday, Augu&s;t 12, 1608, in the forenoon, and publickly being warned to prepare him|&s;elf to his end, which mu&s;t be that day after dinner, he mo&s;t willingly &s;ubmitted him&s;elf unto that puni&s;hment, which (as he then acknowledged) he had ju&s;tly de&s;erved. And being left to him&s;elf, till dinner time was expired, then came to him into that private place where he remained, &s;ome of the reve|rend bi&s;hops, diver&s;e lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, two of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters there employed by his maje&s;ty, with diver&s;e other mini&s;ters of the town of Edinburgh. Before whom he fir&s;t acknowledged and avouched his former confe&s;&s;ion to be true, and that he would die in the &s;ame; and then falling on his knees, in a corner of that room where he and they then were, in a prayer to God uttered aloud, he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately deplored his former wickedne&s;&s;es, but e&s;pecially that &s;in of his, for which he was to die, that a man may ju&s;tly &s;ay, he did in a &s;ort, deject and ca&s;t down him&s;elf to the gates of Hell, as if he &s;hould there have been &s;wallowed up in the gulf of de&s;|peration: yet pre&s;ently laying hold upon the mercies of God in Chri&s;t. he rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him&s;elf, and &s;trangely lifted up his &s;oul unto the throne of grace, applying joy and comfort to his own heart &s;o effectually, as cannot well be de&s;cribed. In the com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ting of this coafolation into his inward man, he bur&s;t out into tears, &s;o plentifully flowing from him, that for a time they &s;topped his voice. The &s;ight, and hearing whereof, wrought &s;o forcible an impre&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e per&s;ons of honour, and learned men, who beheld him, that there was &s;carce any one of them, who could refrain tears in the place, as diver&s;e of them&s;elves that day did witne&s;s unto me.&mdash;After|ward being brought to the &s;caffold where he was to die, he uttered many things, among which, I ob&s;erved the&s;e: He acknowledged to the people, that he was come thither to &s;uf|fer mo&s;t de&s;ervedly; that he had been an offender again&s;t Al|mighty God, in very many re&s;pects; but that none of his &s;ins were &s;o grievous unto him, as that, for which he mu&s;t die; where in, notwith&s;tanding he was not an actor, but a conceal|er only. That he was ingyred (involved) in it by the Laird of Ra&s;talrig, and his &s;ervant, the Laird of Bour, both which, he &s;aid, were men that profe&s;&s;ed not religion. Whereupon, he exhorted men to take heed, how they accompanied with &s;uch as are not religious; becau&s;e, &s;aid he, with &s;uch as make not profe&s;&s;ion of religion, there is no faith, no truth, no holding of their word, as him&s;elf had tried and found. But touching the trea&s;on, for the concealing whereof he was condemned, he added, that he was pre&s;erved alive to open that &s;ecret my&s;tery which &s;o long had lain hid. That God had kept him &s;ince that attempt of the Earl Gowrie, from very many dangers, but notedly from one, when being in appa|rent hazard of drowning, he was &s;trangely delivered; which, &s;aid he, was God's work, that I might remain alive unto this happy and ble&s;&s;ed day, that the truth 
might be made known. And now I 
confe&s;s my fault, to the &s;hame of my&s;elf, and to the &s;hame of the devil; but to the glory of God. And I do it not either for fear of death, or for any hope of life (for I have de&s;erved to die, and am unworthy to live) but becau&s;e it is the truth, which I &s;hall &s;eal with my blood. My fault, &s;aith he, is &s;o great, that if I had a thou&s;and lives, and could die ten thou&s;and deaths, yet I might not make &s;atisfaction, that I &s;hou'd conceal &s;uch a trea&s;on again&s;t &s;o gracious a King. The&s;e, and the like words, when he had &s;poken upon one &s;ide of the &s;caffold, he turned him to the &s;econd &s;ide, and afterward to the third (that all the people might hear) where he &s;pake to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as formerly he had done.&mdash;And here, being told by the &s;aid mini&s;ters, and other per&s;ons of quality, that being &s;o near his departure out of the world, it concerned him to &s;peak nothing but the truth, and that upon the peril of his &s;oul: he an&s;wered, that to the end that they &s;hould know that he had &s;poken no|thing but the verity, and that his confe&s;&s;ion was true in every re&s;pect, he would (at the la&s;t ga&s;p) give them &s;ome ap|parent token for the confirmation of the &s;ame. Then fitting him&s;elf to the ladder, the executioner cometh to him, and as the manner is, a&s;king forgivene&s;s of him; with all my heart, &s;aith he, for you do but your office, and it is the thing I de&s;ire; becau&s;e, &s;uffering in my body, I &s;hall in my &s;oul be joyned to my Saviour. A&s;cending up to the ladder, he de&s;ired the people to &s;ing a p&s;alm with him, which they did with many a weeping eye. He named the 6th p&s;alm, and beginning, or taking it up him&s;elf, in every ver&s;e or line thereof, he went before the people, &s;inging both loud and tunably unto the very end. Then once again confirming and avowing his former confe&s;&s;ion, he covered his own face, and, commending his &s;oul to God, he was turned off the ladder; where hanging by the neck &s;ome little while, he three &s;everal times, gave a loud clap with his hands, that all the &s;tanders-by might hear, which was the &s;ign or token (as it &s;eemeth) which he a little before had &s;aid, that he would give at the la&s;t ga&s;p, for the rati ication and avowing of tho&s;e things, which by his con|fe&s;&s;ion he had &s;o many times declared and delivered. The&s;e things were done in the open &s;ight of the &s;un, in the King's capital town, at the market-cro&s;s in Edinburgh, in the pre|&s;ence o&s; diver&s;e thou&s;ands of all &s;orts; of the nobility, of the clergy, of the gentry, of the burge&s;&s;es, of women and children, my&s;elf, with the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, &s;tand|ing by, and looking on, and giving God the glory, that after &s;o long a &s;pace as eight years and eight days (for &s;o it was by ju&s;t computation, after the attempt of Gowrie) he was plea&s;ed to give &s;o noble a te&s;timony unto that, which by &s;ome maligners, hath been &s;ecretly called in que&s;tion, without any ground or rea&s;on.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Dr. Abbot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot ab&s;tain to give you my judgment of the proceed|ings in the convocation, as you will call it; and both as <HI>rex in &s;olio,</HI> and <HI>unus gregis in eccle&s;ia,</HI> I am doubly concerned. My title to the crown, nobody calls in que&s;tion, but they that neither love you nor me, and you may gue&s;s whom I mean; all that you, and your brethren, have &s;aid of a king in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion (for that word, I tell you, is no more, than that you make u&s;e of in your canon) concerns not me at all: I am the next heir, and the crown is mine by all rights you can name, but that of conque&s;t; and Mr Solicitor, has &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed my own thoughts, concerning the nature of king&s;hip; and concerning the nature of it, <HI>ut in mea per&s;ona,</HI> and, I believe you were all of his opinion, at lea&s;t none of you &s;aid any thing contrary to it, at the time he &s;poke to you from me: but you know all of you, as I think, that my rea&s;on of calling you together, was to give your judgments; how far a chri&s;tian, and a prote&s;tent King, may concur to affi&s;t his neighbours to &s;hake off their obedience to their own &s;overeign? Upon the account of oppre&s;&s;ion, tyran|ny, or what el&s;e you like to name it. In the late Queen's time, this kingdom was very free in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Hollanders, both with arms and advice, and none of your coat ever told me, that any &s;crupled at it in her reign. Upon my coming to England, you may know that it came from &s;ome of your|&s;elves, to rai&s;e &s;cruples about this matter; and albeit, I have often told my mind concerning <HI>jus regium in&s;ubditos,</HI> as in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, in the &s;tar chamber, upon the occa&s;ion of Hales's pamph|let; yet I never took any notice of the&s;e &s;cruples, till the affairs of Spain and Holland forced me to it. All my neigh|bours call on me to concur in the treaty between Holland and Spain, and the honour of the nation will not &s;uffer the Hol|landers to be abandoned, e&s;pecially after &s;o much money and men &s;pent in their quarrel; therefore, I was of the mind to call my clergy together, to &s;atisfy not &s;o much me, as the world about us, of the ju&s;tne&s;s of my owning the Holland|ers at this time. This I needed not to have done, and you have &s;orced me to &s;ay, I wi&s;h I had not; you have dipped too deep, in what all kings re&s;erve among the <HI>arcana imperii;</HI> and whatever aver&s;ion you may profe&s;s again&s;t God's being the author of &s;in, you have &s;tumbled upon the thre&s;hold of that o|pinion, in &s;aying, upon the matter, that even tyranny is God's authority, and &s;hould be remembered as &s;uch. If the King of Spain &s;hould return to claim his old pontifical right to my kingdom, you leave me to &s;eek for others to fight for it, for you tell us upon the matter beforehand, his authority is God's authority, if he prevail.</P>
<P>Mr Doctor, I have no time to expre&s;s my mind further on this theory bu&s;ine&s;s; I &s;hall give you my orders about it by Mr Solicitor, and until then, meddle no more in it, for they are edge tools; or rather like that weapon that is &s;aid to cut with one edge, and cure with the other: I commit you to God's protection, good Dr. Abbot, and re&s;t</P>

In the year 1610, Thomas Ti&s;dale, of Glimpton, in Oxford&s;hire, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> bequeathed five thou&s;and pounds to Dr. George Abbot, then Bi&s;hop of London, Sir John Bennet, and Dr. Aray, to purcha&s;e lands for the maintainance of &s;even fellows and &s;ix &s;cholars; which money was laid out in the purcha&s;e of two hun|dred and fifty pounds a year. Afterwards, Richard Wightwick, B.

See Ward's Lives of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Gre&s;ham Col|lege, fol. 1740. p. 210. in Augu&s;t, 1610, he con&s;ecrated the new church-yard, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Fleet-Ditch, the around of which had been given to the inhabitants of St. Bride's pari&s;h, by the Earl of Dor&s;et. His zeal, and indefatigable diligence, in the publick exerci&s;e of his function, were &s;o remarkable, and the conduct of his private life &s;o exemplary, as well as irre|proachable, that we find him celebrated by an eminent poet.

joined to the King's known regard for the parts and piety of this eminent man, enough to &s;ecure his promotion to the Primacy; but either the King him&s;elf thought of the Bi&s;hop of London, or he was propo&s;ed to him by his old friend and patron, the Earl of Dunbar; and therefore, without taking the advice of tho&s;e prelates, his maje&s;ty prefer|red Bi&s;hop Abbot to the throne of Canterbury, in which he was &s;eated on the 9th of April, 1611; and on the 23d of June following, was &s;worn of his ma|je&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable privy council.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t take heed, how you tru&s;t Dr. Grotius too far, for I perceive him to be &s;o addicted to &s;ome partialities in tho&s;e parts, that he &s;eareth not to la&s;h, &s;o it may &s;erve a turn. At his fir&s;t coming to the King, by rea&s;on of his good Latin tongue, he was &s;o tedious, and full of tittle-tattle, that the King's judgment was of him, that he was &s;ome pedant, full of words, and of no great judgment. And I my&s;elf, di&s;|covering that to be his habit, as if he did imagine that every man was bound to hear him, &s;o long as he would talk, (which is a great burthen to men replete with bu&s;ine&s;s) did privately give him notice thereof, that he &s;hould plainly, and directly, deliver his mind, or el&s;e he would make the King weary of him. This did not &s;o take place, but that afterwards he fell to it again, as was e&s;pecially ob&s;erved one night at &s;upper at the Lord Bi&s;hop of Ely's, whither being brought by Mr. Ca|&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bon, (as I think) my Lord intreated him to &s;tay to &s;upper, which he did. There was pre&s;ent Dr Steward, and another Civilian, unto whom he flings out &s;ome que&s;tion of that pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and was &s;o full of words, that Dr Steward afterwards told my Lord, that he did perceive by him, that, like a &s;matterer, he had &s;tudied &s;ome two or three que&s;tions, where|of when he came in company he mu&s;t be talking to vin|dicate his &s;kill; but if he were put from tho&s;e, he would &s;hew him&s;elf but a &s;imple fellow. There was pre&s;ent al&s;o, Dr Richard&s;on, the King's profe&s;&s;or of divinity in Cam|bridge, and another Doctor in that faculty, with whom he falleth in al&s;o about &s;ome of tho&s;e que&s;tions, which are now controverted among the mini&s;ters in Holland. And being matters wherein he was &s;tudied, he uttered all his &s;kill con|cerning them: my Lord of Ely &s;itting &s;till at the &s;upper all the while, and wondering what a man he had there, who never being in the place or company before, could over-whelm them &s;o with talk for &s;o long a time. I write this unto you &s;o largely, that you may know the di&s;po&s;ition of the man, and how kindly he u&s;ed my Lord of Ely, for his good entertainment.&mdash;You will a&s;k me what is this to you? I mu&s;t tell you therefore, that you &s;hall not be without your part. At the &s;ame time that Sir Noel Caron was together with Grotius, being now to take his leave of the King, it was de&s;ired of his maje&s;ty, that he would not ha&s;tily give his judgment con|cerning points of religion, now in difference in Holland, for that his maje&s;ty had information but of one &s;ide, and that his Amba&s;&s;ador did deal partially, making all reports in favour of the one &s;ide, and &s;aying nothing at all for the other. For he might have let his maje&s;ty know, how factious a generation the&s;e contradicters are; how they are like to our Puritans in England; how refractory they are to the author|ity of the civil magi&s;trate, and other things of like nature, as I wrote you in my former letter. I doubt not but Grotius had his part in this information, whereout I conceive you will make &s;ome u&s;e, keeping the&s;e things privately to your|&s;elf, as becometh a man of your employment. When his maje&s;ty told me this, I gave &s;uch an an&s;wer as was &s;it; and now upon the receipt of your letters, &s;hall upon the fir&s;t occa&s;ion give further &s;atisfaction.

<P>This was the famous ca&s;e of divorce between the Lady Frances Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suf|folk, and Robert, Earl of E&s;&s;ex, her hu&s;band; which has been always con&s;idered as one of the great|e&s;t blemi&s;hes of King James's reign, though the part acted therein by the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, added much to the reputation he had already acqui|red, for un&s;haken and incorruptible integrity.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Un&s;haken and incorruptible integrity.</HI>] This affair of the divorce, was by the King referred to a court of delegates, con&s;i&s;ting of his Grace the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Bi&s;hops of London, Winche&s;ter, Coventry and Litchfield, and Roche&s;ter, Sir Julius Cae&s;ar, Sir Thomas Parrey, Sir Daniel Dunn, Dr John Bennet, Dr Francis James, and Dr Thomas Edwards. This affair was drawn out into a great length, and many accidents happened in the cour&s;e of it, which gave the Archbi&s;hop infinite di&s;quiet. He &s;aw plainly, that the King was very de&s;irous the Lady &s;hould be divorced, and, on the other hand, he was in his judgment directly again&s;t the di|vorce. He laboured all he could to extricate him&s;elf from the&s;e difficulties, by having an end put to the cau&s;e &s;ome other way than by &s;entence, but it was to no purpo&s;e; for tho&s;e who drove on this affair, had got too great power to be re&s;trained from bringing it to the conclu&s;ion they de&s;ired. The Archbi|&s;hop was told, that a predece&s;&s;or of his, which was Archbi&s;hop Grindall, had &s;uffered about Dr. Julio's divorce, and &s;o might he; but this, however, did not at all move him; on the con|trary, he prepared a &s;peech again&s;t the nullity of the marriage, which he intended to have &s;poken in the court at Lambeth, Sep|tember 25, 1613, but he did not make u&s;e of that &s;peech, be|cau&s;e the King ordered them to deliver their opinions in few words. He continued, however, inflexible, with regard to his opinion, and therefore, when &s;entence was pronounced, the court was divided in the following manner.</P>

<P>To ju&s;tify his conduct in this matter, the Archbi&s;hop drew up the rea&s;ons which induced him to be again&s;t the &s;entence, which King James thought fit to an&s;wer him&s;elf, and wrote al&s;o a letter to him upon that &s;ubject, in which there are &s;ome things that are very &s;ingular, and therefore worthy the reader's notice. <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">After that I had fully peru&s;ed and rightly con&s;idered of all your papers, I found your principles &s;o &s;trange, and your doubts &s;o far &s;ought, that I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, as I have already &s;aid, to &s;et down unto you my ob&s;ervations upon them.

And the rea&s;on moving me to this apprehen&s;ion, is partly grounded upon your la&s;t words to me at your parting from Wind&s;or, and partly upon a line
&s;craped out in your paper of doubts, for I am &s;ure you think me not &s;o blunt a &s;ecretary, but that I can read a line &s;o &s;cra|ped out. In your la&s;t &s;peeches with me, you remember you told me, what a&s;&s;urance you had of the Earl's ability out of his own mouth, which you &s;aid you could not but tru&s;t, be|cau&s;e he was &s;o religious a nobleman. But when I told you of the other party's contrary affirmation, you remember how you u&s;ed the word of iniquity, and how far your interlined line &s;eems to have a harmony with this word, your&s;elf can be&s;t judge. Now then if I would a&s;k you what proof you have of the one's religion more than the other's, you mu&s;t an&s;wer me by judging upon the exterior; and how deceivable that gue&s;s is, daily experience teaches us: but with a holy prote&s;tation, that I never knew any thing but good in the young Earl.

gave him; and it had been very happy for him if he had always followed tho&s;e councils<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>If he had always followed tho&s;e councils.</HI>] We have this very remarkable pa&s;&s;age from the Archbi&s;hop's own pen, in the di&s;cour&s;e he wrote upon his di&s;grace, under the reign of King Charles. In that di&s;cour&s;e he ob&s;erves, that it was one of King James's maxims, to take no favourite but what was recommend|ed to him by his Queen, that if &s;he afterwards complained of this Dear One, he might an&s;wer, it is long of your&s;elf, for you were the party that commended him unto me. Our old ma&s;ter, &s;ays the Archbi&s;hop, took delight &s;trangely in things of this nature.

Noble Queen (cries out the Archbi&s;hop after reporting this fact) how like a prophete&s;s did you &s;peak! The re&s;t of the &s;tory being but &s;hort will appear be&s;t in the Archbi&s;hop's own words, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In the end, &s;ays he, upon importunity, Queen Anne conde&s;cended, and &s;o pre&s;&s;ed it with the King, that he a&s;&s;ented thereunto; which was &s;o &s;tricken while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">roh was hot, that in the Queen's bed-chamber, the King knighted him with the rapier which the Prince did wear.

George went in with the King, but no &s;ooner he got loo&s;e, but he came forth unto me in the privy-gallery, and there em|braced me: he profe&s;&s;ed that he was &s;o infinitely bound unto me that all his life long he mu&s;t honour me as his father. And now he did be&s;eech me that I would give &s;ome le&s;&s;ons how he &s;hould carry him&s;elf. When he earne&s;tly followed this chace, I told him I would give him three &s;hort le&s;&s;ons, if he would learn them. The fir&s;t was, that daily upon his knees he &s;hould pray to God to ble&s;s the King his ma&s;ter, and to give him (George) grace &s;tudiou&s;ly to &s;erve and plea&s;e him. The &s;econd was, that he &s;hould do all good offices be|tween the King and the Queen, and between the King and the Prince. The third was, that he &s;hould fill his ma&s;ter's ears with nothing but truth. I made him repeat the&s;e three things unto me, and then I would have him to acquaint the King with them, and to tell me when I met him again, what the King &s;aid unto him.

<OPENER><SALUTE>To Secretary NAUNTON.</SALUTE><SALUTE>Good Mr. Secretary,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE never more de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent at any con&s;ult|ation, than that which is this day to be handled, for my heart and all my heart goeth with it; but my foot is wor&s;e than it was on Friday, &s;o that by advice of my phy&s;ician I have &s;weat this whole night pa&s;t, and am directed to keep my bed this day.</P>
<P>But for the matter; my humble advice is, that there is no going back, but a countenancing of it again&s;t all the world; yea &s;o far as with ringing of bells and making of bon&s;ires in London, &s;o &s;oon as it &s;hall be certainly under&s;tood, that the coronation is pa&s;t, I am &s;atisfied in my con&s;cience that the cau&s;e is ju&s;t, wherefore they have rejected that proud and bloody man; and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e he hath taken a cour&s;e to make that kingdom not elective, but to take it from the donation of another man. And when God hath &s;et up the Prince that is cho&s;en to be a mark of honour thro' all Chri&s;tendom, to propagate his go&s;pel, and to protect the op|pre&s;&s;ed, I dare not for my part give advice, but to follow where God leads.</P>
<P>It is a great honour to the King our Ma&s;ter, that he hath &s;uch a &s;on, who&s;e virtues have made him thought fit to be made a King. And methinks I do in this and that of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> fore&s;ee the works of God, that by piece and piece the kings of the earth that gave their power unto the bea&s;t (all the word of God mu&s;t be fulfilled) &s;hall now tear the whore and make her de&s;olate, as St. John in his Revel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tion has &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">retold. I pray you therefore, with all the &s;pirits you have to put life into this bu&s;ine&s;s; and let a return be made into <HI>Germany</HI> with &s;peed, and with com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, and let it be really pro&s;ecuted, that it may appear to the world, that we are awake when God in this &s;ort calleth us.</P>
<P>If I had time to expre&s;s it, I could be very angry at the &s;huffling which was u&s;ed towards my Lord Donca&s;ter, and the &s;lighting of his emba&s;&s;age &s;o, which cannot but touch upon our great ma&s;ter who did &s;end him; and therefore I would never have a noble &s;on for&s;aken for re&s;pect of them, who truly aim at nothing but their own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">triking in will comfort the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> will honour the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ave,</HI> will &s;trengthen the union, will bring on the States of the Low-Countries, will &s;tir up the King of Denmark, and move his own uncles, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Duke <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bouv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> together with <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ville</HI> (a rich Prince in <HI>France</HI>) to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t in their &s;hares; and <HI>Hungary,</HI> as I hope, (being in that &s;ame cau&s;e) will run the &s;ame fortune.

The next year was in a great mea&s;ure &s;pent in de|bates
<PB N="31" REF="35">
and negotiations upon this &s;ubject, in which the King took a great deal of pains with little effect.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop's declining &s;tate of health, ma|king exerci&s;e a thing not only convenient but nece&s;&s;|ary for him, he was wont in the &s;ummer to make a tour into Hamp&s;hire for the &s;ake of recreation, and being invited by the Lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzil upon the edge of Berk&s;hire, and not far from Hartford Bridge, his Grace met there with the greate&s;t misfortune that befel him in the whole cour&s;e of his life; for hunting in this park on the twenty|fourth of July, he let fly a barbed arrow from a cro&s;s-bow at one of the deer; which unfortunately &s;truck one Peter Hawkins, my Lord Zouch's keep|er, who was quite out of the Bi&s;hop's &s;ight, and had been warned more than once to keep out of the way, in the left arm, by which wound a large blood-ve&s;|&s;el being pierced, he bled to death in an hour's time. This unfore&s;een accident threw the Archbi&s;hop into a deep melancholy, tho' he was not con&s;cious to him|&s;elf of the lea&s;t inadvertency or indi&s;cretion, neither did this wear off in time, but throughout his whole life he ob&s;erved a monthly fa&s;t on a Tue&s;day, the day on which this fatal mi&s;chance fell out, and &s;ettled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow, which &s;oon procured her another hu&s;band.</P>
<P>This affair made a very great noi&s;e, and there wanted not &s;ome to repre&s;ent it in a &s;ini&s;ter light to King James, but his maje&s;ty gave his judgment of matter in a &s;hort and clear &s;entence, <HI>An angel,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>might have mi&s;carried in this &s;ort.</HI> When he was afterwards informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident, he wrote him a con&s;olatory letter with his own hand, in which a|mong&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="36">
other things he told him, that <HI>he would not add affliction to his &s;orrow, or take one farthing from his chattels or moveables which were forfeited by law.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop immediately on this misfortune retired to his own ho&s;pital at Guildford, there to wait the deci&s;ion of the great point as to the irregu|larity, which &s;ome imagined he had incurred, for it happened very unluckily that at this juncture, there were four Bi&s;hops elected but not con&s;ecrated, <HI>viz.</HI> Dr John Williams, lord keeper of the great &s;eal, to the &s;ee of Lincoln; Dr John Davenant, to that of Sali&s;bury; Dr Valentine Cary, to that of Exeter; and his old antagoni&s;t Dr William Laud, who&s;e preferment, on this occa&s;ion, he had warmly oppo|&s;ed, to that of St David's; and all, except Dr Da|venant, &s;crupled the Archbi&s;hop's capacity to lay hands on them till he was cleared from all imputa|tion as to this fact. The King being informed of this, directed, in the beginning of October follow|ing, a commi&s;&s;ion to the ten following per&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord Keeper; the Bi&s;hops of London, Winch|e&s;ter, and Roche&s;ter; the Elects of Exeter and St Davids; Sir Henry Hobart, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the common pleas; Sir John Dodderidge, one of the ju&s;tices of the King's bench; Sir Henry Mar|tin, Dean of the Arches; and Dr. Steward; to con&s;ider and re&s;olve the three following que&s;tions. 1. <HI>Whether the Archbi&s;hop was irregular by the fact of involuntary bomicide?</HI> The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the two Judges, and the two Civilians, were very clear that he was not irregular; the other five thought he he was. 2. <HI>Whether that act might tend to &s;candal in a churchman?</HI> The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hobart, and Dr Steward, doubted; all the re&s;t agreed, that a &s;candal might be taken tho'
<PB N="33" REF="37">
not given. 3. <HI>How his Grace &s;hould be re&s;tored, in ca&s;e the King &s;hould follow the deci&s;ion of tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ion|ers, who had found him irregular?</HI> All agreed that it could not be otherwi&s;e done than by re&s;titution from the King, but they varied in the manner. The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and Dr Steward, thought it &s;hould be done by the King, and by him alone, in the &s;ame patent with the par|don. The Lord Keeper, and the Bi&s;hops of Lond|on, Roche&s;ter, Exeter, and St David's, were for a commi&s;&s;ion from the King directed to &s;ome Bi&s;hops. Judge Dodderidge, and Sir Henry Martin, were de&s;irous it &s;hould be done both ways, for abundant caution. This return was made to his maje&s;ty on the tenth of November 1621, and accordingly a pardon and a di&s;pen&s;ation both bearing date at We&s;t|min&s;ter, the twenty-&s;econd of November, pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal, by which his maje&s;ty a&s;&s;oiled the Arch|bi&s;hop from all irregularity, &s;candal, or infamation, (if any was incurred) and declared him capable of all metropolitical authority, as if this accident had never happened. Such was the clo&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s, after a great variety of proceedings, and many ar|guments publi&s;hed on both &s;ides<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>And many arguments publi&s;hed on both &s;ides.</HI>] As the ca&s;e was ab&s;olutely new, and &s;uch a one as naturally afforded room for talkative and bu&s;y men to di&s;play their abilities; there was nothing &s;urprizing in the noi&s;e this accident made, or the vari|ous con&s;tructions put upon it by different people, according as their notions or their prejudices led them.

But another great writer, [Heylin] gives quite another turn to this whole affair, for he owns that the letter came abroad, not in the&s;e la&s;t times, as Sander&s;on calls them, but at the very time it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be written, yet he denies that the Archbi&s;hop was the author of it, and &s;ugge&s;ts, that it was only fathered upon him, that it might make the greater impre&s;&s;ion upon the people.</P></NOTE>. The King however remained

the &s;aid marriage, were &s;worn to, in the pre&s;ence of the Archbi&s;hop, and other great officers of &s;tate, notwith&s;tanding which they never took effect.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop thenceforward a&s;&s;i&s;ted but &s;eldom at council, being hindered chiefly by his infirmities, but in the King's la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s he was called for, and attended with great con&s;tancy, and received the highe&s;t marks of the King's confidence, to the very la&s;t moment of his life, and was near him when he expired, on the twenty-&s;eventh of March 1625.</P>
<P>At the coronation of King Charles I, the Arch|bi&s;hop, as his office required, &s;et the crown upon his maje&s;ty's head, tho' he was extremely weak, and much troubled with the gout, but thenceforward he vi&s;ibly declined in the King's favour, and the Duke of Buckingham, who was his declared enemy, watched for an opportunity to make the Archbi&s;hop
<PB N="38" REF="42">
feel the weight of his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This was at la&s;t taken, for his refu&s;ing to licen&s;e a &s;ermon, preached by one Dr Sibthorpe, Vicar of Brackley in Northampton&s;hire, to ju&s;tify and pro|mote a loan, which the King had demanded. This &s;ermon was preached at Northampton, in the Lent a&s;&s;izes 1627 before the Judges at Northampton, and it was tran&s;mitted to the Bi&s;hop, with the King's directi|on, to licen&s;e it, which he refu&s;ed to do, and gave his rea&s;ons for it; notwith&s;tanding which, the &s;ermon was licen&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop of London, (Dr Moun|taigne) after many things had been corrected therein, from the lights given by the Archbi&s;hop's objections, for which however it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould &s;uffer. Di&s;cour&s;es of this nature were &s;o loud at court, that &s;ome of his Grace's friends overheard and reported them to him, upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at Croydon; a month before his u&s;ual time. On the fifth of July, Lord Con|way, who was then Secretary of State, made him a vi&s;it, and intimated to him, that the King expected he &s;hould withdraw to Canterbury, which the Arch|bi&s;hop declined, becau&s;e he had a law-&s;uit at that time with that city, and de&s;ired he might rather have leave to go to his hou&s;e at Ford, five miles beyond Canterbury, which was yielded to; and on the ninth of October following, the King granted a commi&s;&s;ion to the Bi&s;hops of London, Durham, Roche&s;ter, Oxford, and Bath and Wells, to execute archiepi&s;copal authority, the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned being no more than this, <HI>That the Archbi&s;hop could not at that time, in his own per&s;on, attend tho&s;e &s;ervices, which were otherwi&s;e proper for his cognizance and juri&s;diction.</HI> Some writers have pretended, that his &s;uppo&s;ed irre|gularity, occa&s;ioned by the Death of Peter Hawkins,

was revived; but the commi&s;&s;ion which is extant on record &s;hews the contrary, nor indeed was that affair ever thought of afterwards; but the Archbi&s;hop did not remain long in this &s;ituation, for the nece&s;&s;ities of the times rendering a parliament nece&s;&s;ary, his Grace was &s;ent for about Chri&s;tmas, and not only re&s;tored to his authority aad juri&s;diction, but, on his coming to court from his palace at Lambeth, was received when he quitted his barge, by the Archbi&s;hop of York and the Earl of Dor&s;et, who conducted him to his maje&s;ty, where, having ki&s;&s;ed the King's hand, he was de&s;ired not to fail the coun|cil chamber twice a week. His Grace &s;at in that parliament which began on the &s;eventeenth of March following, and continued in the full exerci&s;e of his office ever after, of which it may not be ami&s;s to take notice in this &s;ingle in&s;tance. On the twenty-fourth of Augu&s;t 1628, he con&s;ecrated Richard Montagu, to the &s;ee of Chiche&s;ter, a man who had been remarkably bu&s;y in &s;upporting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> pretence of his irregularity, and at this con&s;ecration Dr Laud, then Bi&s;hop of London, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, which is the cleare&s;t proof that can be, that no doubts &s;tuck longer as to his irregularity, even with tho&s;e who loved him lea&s;t.</P>
<P>In parliament, the Archbi&s;hop maintained his credit in as high a degree as any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and it is more than probable, that the knowledge of this procured him &s;uch marks of re&s;pect, as were at this time afforded him by the court. When the Petition of Right, that great pillar of the Engli&s;h liberty, was under con&s;ideration, the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury delivered the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e of Lords thereupon, at a conference with the hou&s;e of Commons, and at the &s;ame time, laid
<PB N="40" REF="44">
before them &s;uch propo&s;itions as their Lord&s;hips had agreed upon, for which, thanks were returned, in &s;et &s;peech, by Sir Dudley Diggs.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of Bi&s;hop Laud was now &s;o great at court, that he drew up a &s;cheme of in&s;tructions, which having the King's name at the head of them, were, in the month of December, 1629, tran&s;mitted to his Grace, under the pompous title, <HI>His Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions to the mo&s;t reverend father in God, George, Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, containing certain orders to be ob&s;erved and put in execution, by the &s;everal Bi&s;hops in his province.</HI> The&s;e in&s;tructions his Grace com|municated to his &s;uffragan Bi&s;hops, in which, as Heylin ob&s;erves, he acted <HI>mini&s;terially;</HI> but to &s;hew that he &s;till meant to exerci&s;e his own authority in his own dioce&s;e, he re&s;tored Mr Palmer and Mr Udnay to their lecture&s;hips, after the Dean and Archdeacon of Canterbury had &s;u&s;pended them; and, in other re&s;pects, &s;oftened the rigour of tho&s;e in&s;tructions, which were contrived to enforce the particular no|tions of a prevailing party in the Church, which the Archbi&s;hop thought a burden too hard to be borne by the tender con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who made the fundamentals of religion their &s;tudy, and were not &s;o zealous for forms.</P>
<P>His conduct in this and other re&s;pects, is &s;aid to have made his pre&s;ence unwelcome at court, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o indeed it &s;eems to have been, for upon the birth of Charles, Prince of Wales, (afterwards King Charles II,) which happened on the 29th of May, 1630, Laud, then Bi&s;hop of London, had the honour to baptize him as D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an of the chapel, notwith&s;tanding that the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury is the Ordinary of the court, and the King's hou&s;hold, wherever it is, are regarded as his pari&s;hioners; &s;o this was

vi&s;ibly as much a &s;light upon the Archbi&s;hop, as an act of favour towards his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop however was proof again&s;t all &s;uch accidents as the&s;e, and went on doing his duty without fear or favour, and yet one of the la&s;t acts of his life plainly &s;hews, that he was very far from being &s;o indifferent towards the di&s;cipline and cere|monies of the Church of England, as &s;ome have repre&s;ented him. This act of his was an order dated the third of July 1633, requiring the pari&s;h|ioners of Crayford in Kent, to receive the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, on their knees, at the &s;teps a&s;cending to the communion table.</P>
<P>We may well &s;tile this one of his la&s;t acts, &s;ince a month a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">terwards, <HI>viz.</HI> on the fourth of Augu&s;t in the &s;ame year, he decea&s;ed at his palace of Croydon, worn out with cares and infirmities, at the age of &s;eventy-one.</P>
<P>He was buried according to his own expre&s;s direction, in the chapel of our Lady, within the church dedicated to the holy Trinity, in his native town of Guildford in Surrey. Soon after his de|cea&s;e, a noble monument was erected over his grave with the effigies of the Archbi&s;hop in his Epi&s;copal robes, and over that his Parliament Robes, in white marble, lying under the Arch &s;upported by &s;ix black marble pillars of the Dorick Order, rai&s;ed on pede&s;tals of books piled up.

<P>THAT worthy Prelate did &s;urely de&s;erve a better repre&s;entation to po&s;terity. He was a very wi&s;e and prudent man, knew well the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the kingdom with re&s;pect to the ceremonies and power of the church, and did there|fore u&s;e a moderation in the point of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, which if it had been followed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the ruin that &s;oon after fell on the church might very likely have been prevented. His being without any credit at court from the latter end of King James's reign will bring no di&s;honour on his memory, if it be con&s;ider'd that his di&s;grace aro&s;e from his di&s;like of, and oppo&s;ition to the imprudent and corrupt mea&s;ures of the court at that time, and from an hone&s;t zeal for the laws and liberties of his country which &s;eem'd then to be in no &s;mall dan|ger, and it was a part truly becoming the high &s;tation he then bore. His advice upon the affair

of the Palatinate and the Spani&s;h match &s;hewed his knowledge of the true intere&s;t of England, and how much it was at his heart; and his behaviour and &s;ufferings in the next reign about the loan and Sibthorp's &s;ermon as they were the rea&s;ons of his di&s;grace at that time, &s;o ought they to render his memory valuable to all who wi&s;h not to &s;ee the fatal coun&s;els and the oppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e times revived in this nation. The Duke of Buckingham was his enemy becau&s;e the Archbi&s;hop would not be his creature, and the church perhaps might have been thought to have been better govern'd, if he had &s;tooped to the Duke and given in to the wantonne&s;&s;es of his power: but he knew the dignity of his cha|racter, and loved his country too well to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a meanne&s;s, tho' very few of his brethren had the courage or hone&s;ty to join with him in this, and if the Archbi&s;hop him&s;elf is to be credited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide his Narrative.</NOTE>, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or's ri&s;e was by the practice of tho&s;e arts this good man could not bend to. As to his learning we need no better te&s;timony of it than his promotion by King James, who had too much affectation that way to prefer any one to &s;uch a &s;tation who had not borne the reputation of a &s;cholar; but there are other proofs of his &s;ufficiency in this, even for the high place he held in the church. If he had &s;ome narrow notions in divinity, they were rather the faults of the age he had his education in, than his, and the &s;ame imputation may be laid on the be&s;t and mo&s;t learned of the reformers.

He had no thoughts of heaping up riches; what he did &s;ave was laid out by him in the erecting and endowing of an hand&s;ome Ho&s;pital for decay'd trade&s;men, and the widows of &s;uch, in the town of Guildford in the county of Surrey, where he was born and had his fir&s;t education; and here I cannot omit taking notice that the body of Statutes drawn by him&s;elf for the government of that hou&s;e, is one of the mo&s;t judicious works of that kind I ever &s;aw, and under which for near one hundred years that Ho&s;pital has main|tain'd the be&s;t credit of any that I know in Eng|land. He was void of all pomp and o&s;tentation, and thought the nearer the church and church-men came to the &s;implicity of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians, the better would the true ends of religion be &s;erved, and that the purity of the heart was to be preferred to, and ought rather to be the care of a &s;piritual go|vernor, than the devotion of the hands only. If under this notion &s;ome niceties in di&s;cipline were given up to goodne&s;s of life, and when the peace of the church as well as of the kingdom was pre&s;erved
<PB N="54" REF="63">
by it, 'twas &s;urely no ill piece of prudence, nor is his memory therefore de&s;erving of tho&s;e &s;landers it has undergone upon that account. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that much of this treatment has been owing to a belief in the admirers and followers of Archbi&s;hop Laud, that the reputation of the latter was encrea&s;ed by depreciating that of the former. They were in|deed men of very different frames and the parts they took in the affairs both of church and &s;tate as difa|greeing. In the church, moderation and the ways of peace guided the behaviour of the fir&s;t, rigour and &s;everity that of the la&s;t. In the &s;tate they &s;e|verally carried the like principles and temper. The one made the liberty of the people and the laws of the land the mea&s;ure of his actions, when the other, to &s;peak &s;oftly of it, had the power of the Prince and the exalting the prerogative only, for the found|ation of his. They were indeed both of 'em men of courage and re&s;olution; but it was &s;edate and temperate in Abbot, pa&s;&s;ionate and unruly in Laud. It is not however to be denied that many rare and excellent virtues were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the latter; but it mu&s;t be owned too, he &s;eems rather made for the hierarchy of another church and to be the mini&s;ter of an arbitrary Prince, and the other to have had the qualifications of a Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop and the guardian of a free &s;tate. Thus much I thought was due to the character of this good man, not only for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice, but as an offering of gratitude to his memory for the great and la&s;ting obligations the town of Guildford (to which I have &s;ome re|lation) lies under to him. And what I have here &s;aid of him I am amply ju&s;tified in, from &s;everal

<HEAD>THE WILL OF <HI>GEORGE ABBOT,</HI> Late Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> 1632.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Name of Almighty God from whom a|lone cometh my help, I George Abbot by the Providence of God Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, con&s;idering with my&s;elf the certaintie of that decree that it is appointed for all men to die once, and weighing the uncertainty of that hour when my Lord and Great Ma&s;ter will call for me, being now in rea&s;onable health and perfect memory, I prai&s;e God for the &s;ame, and being willing to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf, and of that &s;mall portion of wealth which the Lord in mercy hath lent unto me, do make this my la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament as followeth.</P>
<P>FIRST, I do thank the God of Heaven and Earth, for bringing me from meaner e&s;tate to a place of &s;ome note in his church, which by his mercy and un&s;peakable goodne&s;s I have laboured to di&s;charge to my power in &s;implicity of con&s;cience, having ever in my memory that great and la&s;t day of ac|compt, when all mens bodies &s;hall &s;tand before that

tribunal of Chri&s;t, and in the mean while not for|getting that &s;aying of the Prophet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxvi. v. 11.</NOTE>, <HI>Quid retribuam Domino?</HI> becau&s;e in &s;o many troubles as this in|con&s;tant world doth afford his Divine Maje&s;ty did ever protect and uphold me, and &s;o I tru&s;t that high and great God will out of his incomprehen&s;ible love do unto the end. Then I commend my &s;oul unto the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, the Father who created it, the Son who redeemed it, the Holy Gho&s;t who in &s;ome mea&s;ure hath &s;anctified it, be&s;eeching that God in Trinity and the &s;ame Trinity in Unity to receive it into the kingdom of heaven there to reign for ever for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, by who&s;e death and bitter pa&s;&s;ion only which that un&s;potted and inno|cent lamb did &s;uffer for the &s;ins of the world, I &s;tedfa&s;tly hope to have full and free remi&s;&s;ion of all my offences, according to the truth of the go&s;pel now by his great mercy publi&s;hed in this famous Church of England, which I hold to be the be&s;t framed pattern of all the Churches in Europe, and according to the doctrine which in my life-time for full forty years together (when I write this) I have taught in my preaching and maintained in my wri|ting, and in the verity whereof (becau&s;e it is groun|ded upon the &s;acred &s;criptures of the old and new Te&s;tament) I hope to appear with chearfulne&s;s and confidence before the throne of God.</P>
<P>I commend my body to the earth in a&s;&s;ured hope of a joyful re&s;urrection, de&s;iring to be buried in the Trinity Church at Guildford which is near unto my Ho&s;pital, that in the &s;ame town where my fle&s;h had the beginning thereof, it may re&s;t as the <HI>depo|&s;itum</HI> of my love to that place; but I leave all
<PB N="59" REF="68">
circum&s;tances of my interring and funeral to the judgment and di&s;cretion of mine Executors.</P>
<P>I give to the Poor of the pari&s;h of Lambeth thirty pounds; and to the Poor of the pari&s;h of Croydon twenty pounds; both the&s;e &s;ums to be di&s;po&s;ed according to the di&s;cretion of mine Execu|tors, and if it may be it is be&s;t that they &s;hould be directed to &s;ome permanent u&s;e.</P>
<P>I have heretofore given to the Mayor and his Brethren at Guildford one hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Letter to the Corporation of <HI>Guildford.</HI></NOTE>, which &s;um is in their hands, or at lea&s;t in their di&s;po&s;ing, I declared it &s;o at fir&s;t and my de&s;ire is that it &s;hould be pre&s;erved to a perpetual u&s;e, to be lent by five and twenty pounds a man to four &s;everal trade&s;men in that town, to &s;et poor men on work; I would not have the&s;e &s;ums to be lent but upon good &s;e|curity, and to hold for two or three years at the mo&s;t, without any intere&s;t or con&s;ideration (&s;aving paying for making the bonds) and then to be lent from time to time to other traders there, with this provi&s;o upon the bonds that if any of the borrow|ers to die before the end of the term for which the money is lent, that the &s;um be repayed or delivered back to the Mayor and his Brethren within three months after his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>To him who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ucceed me in the Arch|bi&s;hoprick I give all the pictures and maps now hanging in the gallery at Lambeth, together with my barge, praying him not to grieve my Executors for dilapidations, &s;ince it appeareth to the world how careful I have been in repairing all the hou&s;es belonging to the See of Canterbury, beyond that which my predece&s;&s;ors have done in the memory of
<PB N="60" REF="69">
man, and that I have be&s;towed divers thou&s;ands of pounds upon the &s;ame, as may well be &s;een by books of accounts truly kept concerning tho&s;e expences, be&s;ides the care which to my great charge I have had for the pre&s;ervation of the woods of the Arch|bi&s;hoprick &s;tanding in Kent and Surrey, which I have &s;o &s;pared beyond my predece&s;&s;ors, that I have bought timber to the value of &s;ome hundreds of pounds to repair my hou&s;es, becau&s;e I would not cut young trees, but let them grow up to the benefit of my &s;uccce&s;&s;ors; and being now fair I leave it hum|bly to his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ideration, whether it be not fit that my &s;ucce&s;&s;or and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to enter good bond into the exchequer not to cut any timber, &s;aving for nece&s;&s;ary reparations of his own hou&s;es, which was the cour&s;e holden in Queen Elizabeth's days e&s;pecially for the Bi&s;hoprick of Winche&s;ter, and not unfit el&s;ewhere to be followed. I have many books in the great &s;tudy or library at Lambeth marked with the&s;e two letters G C, I bequeath tho&s;e to that library to the u&s;e of the Archbi&s;hops of Canterbury in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and I appoint that a catalogue &s;hould be made of them, and &s;ent to the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral church in Cant|erbury to be there kept, and a tran&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ipt or copy thereof to remain in the library at Lambeth; the co&s;t of this I leave to my Executors, but pray Mr. Baker my &s;ecretary to take &s;ome pains therein for that which &s;hall remain unperfected by me, which I hope &s;hall not be much, yet in that which &s;hall be I would have Mr. Baker to take the advice of my hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hold chaplains being with me in hou&s;e at the time of my death; and becau&s;e I am not ignorant that by fal&s;ehood, cavils in law, or &s;ome negligence, not only tho&s;e books given by me, but tho&s;e which
<PB N="61" REF="70">
were left by my Lord Bancroft may be diverted from the u&s;e of my &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and &s;o this great and good work be fru&s;trated, as far as in me lieth I do in the name of that dreadful and Almighty God, who is the rewarder of all men's de&s;ervings be they good or be they evil, lay it upon the &s;oul and con&s;cience of him and them that &s;hall &s;ucceed me in this Arch|bi&s;hoprick, that to the be&s;t of their power by all means they keep that library and all the books &s;afe as I have done, and I pray God to ble&s;s all them that have that good mind, and to divert and hinder all tho&s;e that have any intendment to the contrary, and this I pray not only for and concerning my &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors but all other per&s;ons what&s;oever,</P>
<P>My next general care is of my &s;ervants among whom I do not know any unhone&s;t or unworthy man, my will for them is that my hou&s;hold &s;hould by my Executors be kept together at my charge for the &s;pace of one month after my decea&s;e, that men may have &s;ome time to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves. And to begin with the poore&s;t; I do give two hundred pounds to be divided by my Executors unto forty yeomen or inferior of my &s;ervants by five pounds a year. And I give forty pounds more to &s;upply any forgetfulne&s;s of mine towards &s;uch as have &s;erved me; or if the &s;um beforenamed do not hold out, tho&s;e la&s;t moneys to be di&s;po&s;ed by the di&s;cretion of mine Executors towards gentlemen or yeomen where they &s;hall &s;ee fit, and according to what proportion they &s;hall hold mo&s;t convenient; tho&s;e to whom I give particular legacies are to have none of this two hundred and the forty pounds, but my &s;ervan s at Croydon are to be taken in. To &s;uch gentlemen
<PB N="62" REF="71">
as at the time of my death &s;hall &s;erve me in hou&s;e, and have no portions or named legacies, I give to each of them a gold ring to the value of forty &s;hil|lings to wear in remembrance of me. And I in|treat my &s;ucce&s;&s;or who&s;oever he &s;hall be to enter|tain &s;o many of my &s;ervants as he &s;hall need, a&s;&s;u|ring him that he can not have more hone&s;t and &s;erviceable per&s;ons to attend him.</P>
<P>To Sir Edmond Scott I give my little &s;ilver clock, and a trencher &s;alt of gold without a cover, which remaineth among my plate, and this he mu&s;t re|ceive as a memorial of my love, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e by my means he is not ill provided for, although if if it were more he is worthy of it.</P>
<P>To Mr. Richard Brigham, the controller of my hou&s;e, I give my four coach mares, and one hundred pounds in money, he knoweth that I have not been altogether forgetful of him in my life-time, but all that I have done is too little, becau&s;e his faithful|ne&s;s, diligence, and di&s;cretion hath been &s;uch in &s;erving me that my e&s;tate by his means hath been the better within doors and without.</P>
<P>To my two chaplains attending me in mine hou&s;e I give my pictures and maps in the gallery at Croy|don, to be divided between them; and to each of them a ring of gold of forty &s;hillings. And &s;uch another ring I give to my chaplain Ma&s;ter Edward Abbott of Loarkin.</P>
<P>To my &s;ecretary Ma&s;ter William Baker, as hone&s;t a man as ever &s;erved any ma&s;ter, I give my gold ring with the table diamond to wear in remembrance of me, praying him to take &s;ome pains to perfect up the catalogue of my books given to the library at Lambeth, that it may orderly appear to po&s;terity what I have left there, according to the care that I
<PB N="63" REF="72">
did take for the books left by my predece&s;&s;our the Lord Bancroft the founder and fir&s;t beginner of that library; I give him al&s;o the great inlayed cabinet of wood &s;tanding in the Queen's chamber at Lambeth, the keys whereof lie in the old de&s;k which &s;tandeth in the &s;tudy, which is next to the clo&s;et near the chapel.</P>
<P>To Ma&s;ter Richard Line I bequeath my le&s;&s;er gold chain, and twenty pounds of money if he owe me &s;o much at the time of my death; I have done &s;omething for him in my life-time according to my ability, and it may fall out that I may do more.</P>
<P>To Ma&s;ter William Sherman I give a gold ring with a turtoy&s;e in it which I have ready lying by me, and a piece of gilt plate of thirty ounces, I have not altogether forgotten him heretofore in &s;ome other matters.</P>
<P>To hone&s;t John Goodwyn I give one hundred marks in money, and my big clock which u&s;eth commonly to &s;tand in my chamber; I have much de&s;ired to leave him &s;ome office or matter of con|tinuance, but God hitherto hath not offered me the means to do it according to my de&s;ire.</P>
<P>To Ralph Watts who long hath &s;erved me pain|fully and diligently I give al&s;o one hundred marks in money, and a gold ring with a turkoi&s;e in it; I have done &s;omething for him be&s;ides, but I wi&s;h it were much more.</P>
<P>To Walter Dob&s;on my receiver, and the receiver of the archbi&s;hoprick, I give twenty pounds, and the ring with the We&s;t-Indian &s;apphire which I have u&s;ed to wear having my arms cut in it; I hope he hath not utterly lo&s;t his time under me, and therefore he will be content with this remembrance of
<PB N="64" REF="73">
him. I leave him al&s;o my little written book with the blue &s;trings, wherein are &s;et down the lea&s;es and woods, and provi&s;ions belonging to the archbi&s;hop|rick, I would have him keep it to him&s;elf for it may be of good u&s;e unto him.</P>
<P>To George Ai&s;me, my page and god&s;on, I give ten pounds, and one of the &s;ummer nags which I have running among&s;t my hor&s;es.</P>
<P>To Ma&s;ter John Harte, &s;ometime &s;olicitor of my cau&s;es, I give all the arrearages of young Live&s;ays ward&s;hip, if any be behind; and I give him al&s;o a gold ring with a turtoi&s;e in it.</P>

To Wal|ter Dob&s;on I give that which is left of Turvey's ward&s;hip <HI>(videlicet)</HI> fifty &s;hillings yearly. And to George Hollis the remainder of Pole Wheeler's ward&s;hip &s;o long as it doth continue, I do not know the time but it is fifty &s;hillings by the year.</P>
<P>To Sir Dudley Diggs, my antient pupil in Ox|ford, I give my ring &s;et with an orient &s;apphire, and all my antique coins of gold, &s;ilver, and bra&s;s which are in my &s;tudy at Lambeth.</P>
<P>To Sir Henry Martin, dean of the arches, and my good friend, I bequeath all my &s;erpentine cups and ve&s;&s;els, which I give him that when he &s;eeth ru&s;eth t h em he may think of me.</P>
<P>To Ma&s;ter Serjeant Hendon, my old Oxford acquaintance and friend, careful in my law-bu&s;ine&s;s, I give the fair bible which lieth in a white box,

&s;tanding in that room wherein I have heretofore or|dinarily &s;tudied while I remained at Lambeth.</P>
<P>To the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury I do give five and twenty of tho&s;e books which now re|main in my &s;tudy at Croydon, and I do give five and twenty more (to be taken after the other from thence) to the Dean and Chapter of Winche&s;ter to be put into their &s;everal libraries, and the&s;e I wi&s;h my Executors to choo&s;e out with the privity and &s;ome advice of the Dean or Vice-Dean of tho&s;e churches for the time being, &s;uppo&s;ing that they wi&s;h to have &s;uch books as be not in their libraries already.</P>
<P>For Baliol college I have done divers things al|ready, and if God &s;end me life I have a purpo&s;e to let them ta&s;te &s;omething more of my courte&s;y.</P>
<P>There is a lea&s;e of two hou&s;es which was taken in the name of my brother Sir Morris Abbot, as he very well knoweth, my will is that my executors do &s;o order it that twenty pounds yearly out of the benefit ari&s;ing by that lea&s;e, be paid to my bro|ther John Abbot of Guildford during his life, if the lea&s;e do &s;o long continue; and other twenty pounds yearly ari&s;ing from that lea&s;e I appoint to be paid to the wife of Peter Hawkins &s;ometime of Bram&s;il in Hamp&s;hire, for &s;o long as the &s;aid wo|man doth live and no longer.

I would have my executors and the ma&s;ter of the ho&s;pital ever willing and ready to help forward mine inten|tion, and if they all look at the public and not too much at the private, God will give a great ble&s;&s;ing unto it.

For the en|dowment of the poor of the ho&s;pital I have bought land at Merrow, of one Ma&s;ter Harwood, and I have already pa&s;&s;ed it to that hou&s;e; if there be no &s;uch conveyance made, I do by this my will give that land to the ma&s;ter and brethren of that ho&s;pital. I have bought al&s;o of one Ma&s;ter Goodwin lands at Me|redin, or lands called Meredin, to the rent of forty pounds by the year. And of one Con&s;table I have bought land at Hor&s;ham, yielding rent to the value of forty pounds by the year. The&s;e two parcels I do give to my ho&s;pital for ever, and I would have my executors to help forward tho&s;e donations of mine if there be cau&s;e, but no way to hinder them. I have bought of Thomas Hill land at Ewhur&s;t for the yearly rent of twenty-&s;even pounds, ten &s;hil|lings; if it &s;hall &s;eem fit to Mr. George Duncan to have this land changed, I &s;hall not be again&s;t it, &s;o that there be as much land for value, and a good title laid in lieu of it; but be it one or the other I give it to my ho&s;pital. For the upholding of the manufacture &s;et up by me in Guildford I do give one hundred pounds a year for ever to the &s;aid my ho&s;pital, (that is to &s;ay) three&s;core pounds a year bought of Ma&s;ter Bi&s;he, and forty pounds by
<PB N="70" REF="79">
the year lying at Charlewood and bought of one Pol&s;don; and how&s;oever perhaps I do not hitt on the right names of the &s;ellers, or the places where the&s;e lands lie, I will that it be no hinderance to this my donation or donations, but that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons be made good to the ma&s;ter and brethren of my ho&s;pital. I intended for the maintenance of the poor of my ho&s;pital two hundred pounds by the year, and now by the relea&s;ing of certain wood ground bought of one Bromfield of Katherine-Hill near Guildford, there wanteth the rent of twelve pounds ten &s;hillings yearly charged upon my ho&s;pital. If I provide not this in my life-time, I require my exe|cutors to &s;upply it with &s;peed; but I am upon a bargain in Su&s;&s;ex, which I hope &s;hall clear it up all. And whereas my good friend Sir Nicholas Kempe did by his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, give five hundred pounds to be be&s;towed on &s;ome good work as I &s;hould think meet, I here declare that I have be|&s;towed that whole &s;um upon &s;ome of the lands be|fore-mentioned to be bought and conveyed to my ho&s;pital, which I do being warranted thereunto not only by the general words of his will, but by par|ticular &s;ignification from him&s;elf, for he was pre&s;ent when I laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of the chapel for that ho&s;|pital and gave me one hundred pounds towards the work, and &s;ince from to time, and lately before his death being with me at Croydon, he voluntarily a&s;&s;ured me he would be mindful of that hou&s;e and foundation; and whereas he doth not in his will &s;pecially name the ho&s;pital, I conceive the rea&s;on of it out of true ground to be, becau&s;e he did not know whether I would have any man's name u&s;ed in the founding of that hou&s;e and corporation be|&s;ides mine own; but I declare him now a principal
<PB N="71" REF="80">
and the only benefactor of moment to that place, and I have cau&s;ed mention to be made of it in the &s;tatutes of that hou&s;e that he did confer to that foundation &s;ix hundred pounds, which to po&s;terity will be an honour and memorial to that good knight &s;ometime an officer in the archbi&s;hoprick and to me.</P>
<P>For the performance of this my la&s;t will and te&s;tament I mu&s;t appoint &s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons to take care, I having a good part been mine own ex|ecutor, having already di&s;tributed with mine own hands much of that little which God hath given unto me. But yet for the further accompli&s;hing of that which I intend, and for the di&s;po&s;ing of my funeral, I appoint my executors my brother Sir Morris Abbot Knight, and my nephew Mr. Mau|rice Abbot of the Inner-Temple, Barri&s;ter, not doubting but care will be taken that all things &s;hall be performed according to my true meaning above expre&s;&s;ed. What&s;oever is remaining (my funeral charges excepted) be it money, bonds, plate, debts, cattle, or other moveables will fall to mine executors, who I doubt not but will take pains for the per|formance of my will, and among other things will look that my note books which are written with mine own hand, be &s;afely kept. Such legacies as I have given to my &s;ervants I wi&s;h to be &s;atisfied with all convenient &s;peed, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are the poorer of them; and the like I declare for that which is by me bequeathed to the pari&s;hes of Lam|beth and Croydon. There is no great matter to be done to my ho&s;pital, but if any &s;mall thing be re|qui&s;ite I would have it done as &s;oon as may be.</P>
<P>So be&s;eeching Almighty God to increa&s;e the

<HEAD>A WORTHY AND MEMORABLE LETTER, RECEIVED From the Lord of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> his Grace.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Memorand. That the letter underwritten being &s;ent to this Town, before this day, by the Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, his grace, for &s;pecial rea&s;ons is or|dered to be regi&s;tered on Record, and followeth in the&s;e words, viz.</OPENER>
<P>AFTER my hearty commendations, I do not live &s;o far from you, but that I many times do enquire of the &s;tate of your town, which, becau&s;e it was the place of my beginning, I cannot chu&s;e but have in extraordinary recom|mendation. And under&s;tanding that it hath not plea&s;ed God to give unto it that flouri&s;hing e&s;tate for trade and traffique which I have known it &s;ometime to have, I have often, both in medi|tation with my&s;elf, and in con&s;ideration with &s;ome of my friends, your well willers, debated by what means I might give the be&s;t furtherance unto the &s;ame, wherein if I &s;hall acquaint you with my thoughts, you will bear with me, becau&s;e they all proceed from a good mind toward you, and if I erre in any thing, upon information I &s;hall quickly be reformed. Fir&s;t therefore you mu&s;t know, that
<PB N="74" REF="83">
con&s;idering my perpetual expence, my means are not great, to bring about &s;ome &s;uch thing as my heart hath de&s;ired, as perhaps for the erecting of &s;ome ho&s;pital, as my mo&s;t worthy predece&s;&s;or the Lord Archbi&s;hop Whitgift did at Croydon, the like whereof would require a full pur&s;e, and long continuance of time in the place which I hold, whereof no man can take to him&s;elf any a&s;&s;urance, &s;ince we are daily in the hand of God, and enjoy our breath, but at his plea&s;ure. But in this I do not forget, that this may be a relief for &s;ome few aged folks, but the generality of the town is not the better for it, whereas if the corporation did thrive and flouri&s;h, tho&s;e poor and aged people, would ea&s;ily be maintained by the charity of &s;uch as be of be&s;t ability.</P>
<P>Some other time, my mind hath run upon be&s;towing of &s;ome &s;tock upon the town, that men who do trade, might have &s;ome money lent them for two or three years, freely, putting in &s;ome good &s;ecurity to the Mayor and his brethren to repay the &s;ame again, that &s;o the &s;tock may go from hand to hand, and be pre&s;erved to po&s;terity. But here I have thought that if trade be not good, this can little avail, for a well meaning man may be de|cayed, and not only lo&s;e that which is lent unto him, but that al&s;o which he hath of his own, and then to force &s;ureties to pay his debt, is to weaken the e&s;tate of other who did undertake for him. Upon the&s;e and the like deliberations, I have thought then with my&s;elf what cour&s;e there may be taken for the advancing of trade among&s;t you, which will &s;et the poor on work, and may be a benefit unto the common-wealth, and the thing which I mo&s;t pitch upon is clothing, becau&s;e both
<PB N="75" REF="84">
town and country hath been accu&s;tomed thereunto. And yet herein I confe&s;s that the making of your ker&s;ies doth give me little &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e &s;ometimes they are up for the price, and &s;ometimes they are down; and as far as I can learn by the Merchants which deal for cloth, there is not great hope in that kind of any certainty hereafter.</P>
<P>So that this putting me to &s;eek further, I have entred into con&s;ideration, whether it were not good to fall to the making of &s;tuffes, as they call them; as Say, Serge, Dorincks, Durance, Perpetuana, and other of that kind, which might employ the wool growing thereabout, and exerci&s;e the people in Labour. And here I find as many difficulties, for it is a great attempt to alter the trade of a Town &s;o far from the former cour&s;e thereof; and perhaps a glutt of them may cau&s;e them to be as ill vented as other cloths are now.</P>
<P>Thus out of my love to the place of my birth, and to you all, I &s;tand di&s;tracted what to do, if God &s;hould make me able to effect any thing for you; but after all tho&s;e ways above-named, my meditations have fallen upon this, whether in pro|bability the making of broad cloth, either blues or mingled, or white, be not a likelier trade to thrive than that which is now u&s;ed; and if there may be appearance thereof, (for certainty I know there is none in any mortal thing) the greate&s;t will be to alter the tools which now are, as Racks, Mills, &amp;c. into tho&s;e which are convenient for the making of broad Cloth; now in this methinks I may give you &s;ome help, If I &s;hall do as the low Countrymen lately have promi&s;ed to do to their people, the more to invite them to the making of cloth, That is, to be&s;tow four or five pound upon
<PB N="76" REF="85">
every man that will &s;et up a loom at fir&s;t; and in like proportion to the alteration of Mills, and other in&s;truments fit for that whereof I &s;peak, which, if God do ble&s;s me, I &s;hall be willing to do to &s;ome rea&s;onable quantity, if it may do good unto that corporation, the welfare whereof I &s;o much de&s;ire.</P>
<P>My reque&s;t unto you Mr. Mayor, and to your brethren, is, that you will think upon the&s;e things, and meeting together at your own oppor|tunities, deliberate what may be mo&s;t available for the place wherein you live, which I would have you to beat, and beat again with your&s;elves, and others, before you return me an an&s;wer, le&s;t if any alteration &s;hould ha&s;tily be, and it &s;hould have ill &s;ucce&s;s, blame &s;hould be laid upon me when I have not de&s;erved it. And if you can find out any other matter, than tho&s;e which I have thought upon, if they be not of too great Charge, I &s;hall upon Con&s;ultation, ea&s;ily conde&s;cend unto your de|&s;ire, for I have a meaning to do you &s;ome good, as God &s;hall &s;end me life, and afford me ability.</P>
<P>In token whereof, I have now di&s;patched away one hundred pounds, which I tru&s;t my Country|man Mr. Robert Parkhur&s;t, will &s;ee by exchange conveyed unto you. And this money I would have to be no way employed, but to be laid up in &s;afe cu&s;tody, until &s;uch time as I &s;hall give order for the u&s;ing of the &s;ame, upon &s;uch re&s;olution as I &s;hall receive jointly from you. And &s;o thanking you for &s;undry remembrances, which at &s;everal times I have received from you, I forbear at this time to be further trouble&s;ome to you, but leave you to the good ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty.</P>

<P>THE Ho&s;pital which the Archbi&s;hop &s;o nobly endowed, at Guildford, &s;tands over-again&s;t Trinity Church; it is built of brick in a qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dran|gular form, with a noble tower at it's entrance, and four turrets over the gate. In the &s;outh ea&s;t corner of the quadrangle are genteel apartments for the ma&s;ter; on the we&s;t &s;ide are apartments for the brethren, and on the ea&s;t for the &s;i&s;ters. The chapel at the north ea&s;t corner, is &s;pacious and high roofed, and has two large gothic windows of painted gla&s;s very well &s;tained, repre&s;enting as follows. The north window has four lights, divided with &s;tone work: in the fir&s;t, I&s;aac is &s;ending E&s;au for veni&s;on, Rebecca behind; and from a window, at a di&s;tance, E&s;au is di&s;covered hunting.

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ROBERT ABBOT, Bi&s;hop of <HI>SALISBURY.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="153">THE LIFE OF Bi&s;hop ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS learned and humble man, was born <HI>anno</HI> 1560, and bred up under the &s;ame &s;chool-ma|&s;ter, with his brother the Archbi&s;hop; till being &s;ufficiently qualified for the univer&s;ity he was &s;ent to Baliol College in Oxford, <HI>anno</HI> 1575.</P>
<P>In 1582, he took his Ma&s;ter of Arts degree; be|came a noted preacher there, al&s;o a con&s;tant lecturer at St. Martin's Church, in the Quadrivium, and &s;ometimes at Abingdon in Berk&s;hire.</P>
<P>His preferment was remarkably owing to his merit, particularly in preaching; notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tinction which &s;ome have affected to make, be|tween the talents and tempers of the&s;e two brothers; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That George was the more plau&s;ible preacher, Robert the greater &s;cholar; George the abler &s;tate&s;|man, Robert the deeper divine: gravity did frown in George, and &s;mile in Robert:"</Q> &s;uch the quali|ties of this Robert evidently were; that upon the fir&s;t &s;ermon he preached at Worce&s;ter, he was made lecturer in that city, and &s;oon after rector of All-Saints there; and upon a &s;ermon he preached at Paul's Cro&s;s, he was pre&s;ented to the rich benefice of
<PB N="148" REF="154">
Bingham in Nottingham&s;hire, by one of his auditors, John Stanhope, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and it is ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'As dew dropping on mowen gra&s;s refre&s;heth it, and maketh it &s;pring anew, &s;o his labours in his pa&s;to|ral charge much refre&s;hed the con&s;ciences of true converts, which had felt the &s;cythe of God's judg|ments, and made them <HI>&s;pring</HI> up in <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>new|ne&s;s</HI> of life; again, as dew di&s;tilling in &s;ilver drops mollifieth the parched ground, &s;o his heart melting into tears in many penitential exhortations mollifi|ed the &s;tony hearts of tho&s;e who had been before mo&s;t obdurate in their &s;ins; and again, as dew that falls from heaven returns not thither back again, but enricheth the &s;oil, and makes fruitful the earth; &s;o his pains where&s;oever he be&s;towed them were never &s;teril, but brought forth much fruit of comfort both to him&s;elf, and of knowledge in the my&s;teries of &s;alvation to his hearers.'</Q></P>
<P>In 1594 he became no le&s;s eminent for &s;ome of his writings; particularly, again&s;t a certain Papi&s;t, on the Sacrament. He then took his degrees in divinity; that of Doctor being completed in 1597.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of King James I, he he was made chaplain in ordinary to him; and this King &s;o well e&s;teemed of his writings, that, with the &s;econd edition of Dr. Abbot's book <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Antichri&s;to,</HI> in 1608, his maje&s;ty ordered his own commentary upon part of the Apocalyp&s;e to be printed: an honour, which that King did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom. And, in truth, the Doctor's pen had now brought him al&s;o into general e&s;teem, for what he had hitherto publi&s;hed in Defence of Willi|am Perkins's <HI>Reformed Catholic,</HI> again&s;t Dr. William Bi&s;hop, now a &s;ecular prie&s;t, but afterwards, in the Pope's &s;tile, a titular Bi&s;hop, of the A&euml;rial Dioce&s;e
<PB N="149" REF="155">
of Chalcedon. It is a&s;&s;erted by Dr. Featley, in his life of Abbot, that he has herein given that William Bi&s;hop as great an overthrow, as Jewell to Harding, Bil&s;on to Allen, or Reynolds to Hart. At the end of this excellent work is added a particular treati&s;e, he &s;oon after writ, intitled, <HI>The true ancient Roman Catholick;</HI> which he dedicated to Prince Henry; to whom it was &s;o acceptable, that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand, and promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, upon the next vacancy, to advance him higher in the Church. And though by that Prince's untimely death the Doctor lo&s;t &s;ome hopes, yet, in cour&s;e of time, his de&s;erts found other friends to do him that ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In 1609, he was unanimou&s;ly elected ma&s;ter of Ba|liol College. Here it is ob&s;erved of him, that he was careful and &s;kilful, to &s;et in this nur&s;ery the be&s;t plants; and then took &s;uch care to water and prune them, that in no plat, or knot, throughout the Univer&s;ity of Ox|ford, there appeared more beautiful flowers, or grew &s;weeter fruit, than in Baliol College, while he was ma|&s;ter. His diligent reading to his &s;cholars, and his con|tinual pre&s;ence at public exerci&s;es, both countenanced the readers, and encouraged the hearers. The&s;e regu|lations and improvements he further wrought, by e|&s;tabli&s;hing piety, which had been much neglected; re|&s;toring peace, which had been long wanted; and making temperance more familiar among them, which had been too great a &s;tranger in that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In May 1610, we find him nominated by the King, among the fir&s;t fellows of his maje&s;ty's Royal College at Chel&s;ea, then newly founded, and de&s;ign|ed as a kind of fortre&s;s for controver&s;ial divinity; being thus, as it were, engarri&s;oned, with the mo&s;t able and &s;elect champions for the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e,

again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults of Popery: and in November the &s;ame year, he was made prebendary of Normanton, in the church of Southwell.</P>
<P>Upon his preaching a &s;ermon before the King, during his month of waiting at court, in 1612, when the news of Dr. Thomas Holland's death was brought from Oxford, his maje&s;ty named him &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or in the Thealogical Chair, u&s;ually called the King's Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity; but he mode&s;tly re|fu&s;ed the &s;ame, till his brother procured a mandate from the King for him to hold it. Some notable circum&s;tances we meet with of him in this &s;tation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Some notable circum&s;tances,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in this &s;tation.</HI>] Among the re&s;t, while he was Profe&s;&s;or in the chair at Oxford, was, his preaching a &s;ermon before the univer&s;ity; in which, he &s;o &s;ig|nificantly laid open the oblique methods then u&s;ed by tho&s;e who &s;ecretly favoured Popery, to undermine the Reformation; and Dr. Laud, then pre&s;ent, was &s;o notoriou&s;ly &s;u&s;pected to be one who u&s;ed tho&s;e methods, as to have the &s;aid reflections applied by the whole auditory to him; that in great vexation he wrote to his patron, Dr. Neal, then Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, (therefore about the year 1614) to know whether he &s;hould not make a direct reply to it. The pa&s;&s;age Laud objected to, was, that Abbot &s;hould &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There were men, who, under pretence of truth, and preaching again&s;t the Puritans, &s;truck at the heart and root of that faith and religion now e&s;tabli&s;h|ed among us; which was the very practice of Par&s;ons and Campian's coun&s;el, when they came hither to &s;educe young &s;tudents; who, afraid to be expelled, if they &s;hould openly profe&s;s their conver&s;ion, were directed to &s;peak freely again&s;t the Puritans, as what would &s;uffice: &s;o the&s;e do not expect to be accounted Papi&s;ts, becau&s;e they &s;peak only again&s;t Puri|tans; but becau&s;e they are indeed Papi&s;ts, they &s;peak no|thing again&s;t them: or if they do, they beat about the bu&s;h, and that &s;oftly too, for fear of di&s;quieting the birds that are in it.'</Q> Hereupon, Laud, in his letter to the &s;aid Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, complains, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he was fain to &s;it patiently at the rehear&s;al of this &s;ermon, though abu&s;ed almo&s;t an hour to|gether, being pointed at as he fat; yet would have taken no notice of it, but that the whole univer&s;ity applied it to him; and his friends told him, he &s;hould &s;ink in his credit, if he an&s;wered not Dr. Abbot in his own: neverthele&s;s, he would be patient; and de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip to vouch&s;afe him &s;ome direction.'</Q> But as we hear not that Laud did an&s;wer it, the Bi&s;hop might perhaps vouch&s;afe him rather directions to be quiet.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="151" REF="157">
and herein, he has had the character given him of a profound divine, mo&s;t admirably well read in the fathers, councils, and &s;choolmen; and a more mo|derate Calvinian, than either of his two predece&s;&s;ors in the divinity-chair, Holland and Humphrey, were; which he expre&s;&s;ed by countenancing the Sublap&s;a|rian way of prede&s;tination.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, upon the King's peru&s;al of his <HI>Antilogia,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Apology</HI> for Garnet, and the fame of his incomparable lectures in the univer&s;ity, upon the King's &s;upreme power, again&s;t Bellarmine and Suarez, (printed after his death) his maje&s;ty, when the See of Sali&s;bury fell void, &s;ent his <HI>Conge d' Elire</HI> for him to the Dean and Chapter.</P>
<P>Thus, as he &s;et forward, one foot in the temple of virtue, his other &s;till advanced in the temple of ho|nour, though indeed, but lei&s;urely; which is impu|ted to his own humility; the ob&s;truction of his foes, who traduced him for a Puritan, (though cordial to the doctrine of the Church of England) and the unwillingne&s;s of &s;ome friends to adorn the Church with the &s;poil of the Univer&s;ity, and mar a Pro|fe&s;&s;or to make a Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>He was con&s;ecrated by his own brother the Arch|bi&s;hop, on December 3, 1615, in his chapel at Lambeth. Herein equalizing the felicity of Seffridus, &s;ome time Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who being a Bi&s;hop him&s;elf, al&s;o &s;aw his brother, at the &s;ame time Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>

Other bi&s;hopricks were voiced upon him; but the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nullity before-mentioned, in his bro|ther's life) made a nullity for a time in his Grace's good intentions; in&s;omuch, that King James, when the Doctor, newly con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Sarum, came to do his homage, &s;aid plea&s;antly to him, Abbot, <HI>I have had very much to do to make thee a Bi&s;hop; but I know no rea&s;on for it, unle&s;s it were, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t written again&s;t one;</HI> alluding to the name of the Po|pi&s;h prie&s;t before-mentioned.</P>
<P>In his way to Sarum, he made a farewel oration at the univer&s;ity, with great applau&s;e. We have &s;ome fragments of it pre&s;erved, in the original Latin, in Hollandi Her. Angl. and Featley's Life of Abbot; and a tran&s;lation thereof, or epitome in Engli&s;h, by Lupton, in his Hi&s;t. of modern Prote&s;tant Divines. His brethren, the heads of hou&s;es, and other Ox|ford friends, parted with him on the edge of his dioce&s;e with tears for grief; and the gentry of Sarum received him with tho&s;e of joy. The next Sabbath|day following, he offered his <HI>fir&s;t fruits in the temple,</HI> taking for his text, the words of the P&s;almi&s;t 26. 8. <HI>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</HI></P>
<P>After he had verified the Words of his Text in the per&s;on of David, his Sermon ended, he verified it in him&s;elf, and made a demon&s;tration that he loved that hou&s;e of God, <HI>not in tongue only and in word, but in deed and verity;</HI> for ob&s;erving the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed, through negligence, and the covetou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e who filled their pur&s;es, with that which &s;hould have &s;topped the chinks, he u&s;ed &s;uch means with the prebendaries, as drew from them five hundred pounds, which he applied to the reparation of the church; and then laboured to re|pair

the congregation, both by doctrine and di&s;ci|pline, vi&s;iting his whole dioce&s;e in per&s;on, and prea|ching every Sabbath-day, whil&s;t his health would permit, either in the city, or in the neighbouring towns; but this was not long, for my author tells us, that preaching on John 14. v. 16. <HI>I will pray the father and he &s;hall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</HI> many of his hearers, pre&s;aged his departure from them; &s;o indeed it proved his la&s;t and farewel &s;ermon, for &s;oon after he came out of the pulpit, he was &s;eized with mo&s;t dreadful fits of the &s;tone in the kidneys, which were brought on by that &s;edentary cour&s;e he had accu&s;t|omed him&s;elf to, by his clo&s;e application to &s;tudy, &s;o that his hour-gla&s;s, contrary to others, the <HI>&s;ooner ran out, by being &s;topped.</HI> But in all the bodily tor|tures of his la&s;t fit, his &s;oul was at ea&s;e; for the a&s;&s;urance of heavenly things, cau&s;ed him mo&s;t chear|fully to part with earthly, and the quick &s;en&s;e he had of the <HI>powers of the life to come</HI> deaded the &s;en&s;e of his bodily pains. There were many came to vi&s;it him on his death-bed, and among others the Judges being then at Sarum in their circuit, to whom he &s;pared not his chri&s;tian admonitions; and among&s;t many points he di&s;cour&s;ed on before them, in&s;i&s;ted very much upon the benefit of a good confcience, rendering many thanks to his Creator for the great comforts he felt thereby now in his extremity, and admo|ni&s;hed all that heard him, &s;o to carry them&s;elves in their mo&s;t private and &s;ecret actions as well as in their publick, that they might obtain that at the la&s;t which would &s;tand them in more &s;tead, than what all the world could afford be&s;ides. Having, when death approached, &s;ummoned his dome&s;ticks, and with broken &s;peeches in the language of a dying man, beginning to make a profe&s;&s;ion of his faith, his

friends per&s;uaded him to refrain, it being manife&s;t in his writings; he yielded to their advice, and &s;igned all his works with the&s;e words; <HI>That faith which I have defended in my writings, is the truth of God; and in the avouching thereof I leave the World.</HI> Thus with exhortations, benedictions, and the pains of his di|&s;ea&s;e, quite worn out, he lay as it were &s;lumbering, with now and then a &s;hort ejaculation; and at length, with eyes and hands uplifted for the &s;pace of two or three hours, after &s;ome weeks continuance in that dreadful di&s;order, he gave up the gho&s;t, on March the 2d, 1617, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, with the&s;e words; <HI>Come Lord Je&s;u, come quickly, fini&s;h in me the work that thou ha&s;t begun; into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my &s;pirit, for thou ha&s;t re|deemed me: O God of truth, &s;ave me thy &s;ervant, who hopes and confides in thee alone: let thy mercy, O Lord, he &s;hewn unto me: in thee have I tru&s;ted, O Lord, let me not be confounded for ever.</HI></P>
<P>He had not completely filled this &s;ee two years and three months, being one of the five Bi&s;hops which Sali&s;bury &s;aw in &s;ix years; and was buried over again&s;t the Bi&s;hop's &s;eat in the cathedral. Dr. Featley who was his dome&s;tic chaplain, tells us, that he had &s;o endeared him&s;elf to the inhabitants of Sa|li&s;bury by his diligence in his pa&s;toral charge, by his ho&s;pitality and bounty to the poor, and lovely and lowly carriage even towards his inferiours, that he was univer&s;ally lamented.</P>
<P>He had been twice married, the la&s;t time with &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure to the Archbi&s;hop, about half a year after his promotion to the &s;aid &s;ee.

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Sir MORRIS ABBOT, LORD-MAYOR OF <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="164">THE LIFE OF Sir MORRIS ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>MORRIS ABBOT, the younge&s;t &s;on of Mr. Maurice Abbot, of Guildford, and brother to Robert and George beforementioned, was bred up to trade, and became an eminent merchant in the city of London, but was more remarkably di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, by his applying him&s;elf to the direction of the affairs of the Ea&s;t-India company, and his ear|ne&s;t attention to whatever might promote the exten|&s;ive commerce of this nation, or &s;trengthen her fo|reign colonies.</P>
<P>In this quality, we find him one of the commi&s;&s;i|oners employed in the negotiation and conclu&s;ion of a treaty with the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company, by which the Molucca I&s;lands, and the commerce to them, is declared to be two thirds belonging to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company, and one to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>This treaty was concluded at London, on the &s;eventh of July, 1019, and ratified by King James, the &s;ixteenth of the &s;ame month, and is as remarka|ble a tran&s;action as any in that reign.</P>
<P>It was in con&s;equence of this treaty, and in order to recover the goods of &s;ome Engli&s;h merchants, that Sir Dudley Diggs, and Morris Abbot, were &s;ent over into Holland, in the &s;ucceeding year, 1620, but with what &s;ucce&s;s does not appear.</P>
<P>He was afterwards one of the farmers of the cu&s;toms, as appears from a commi&s;&s;ion granted in 1623, to him and to many other per&s;ons, for admini&s;t|ering
<PB N="158" REF="165">
the oaths to &s;uch per&s;ons, as &s;hould either de|&s;ire to pa&s;s the &s;eas from this kingdom, or to enter it from foreign countries.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding year, 1624, he was appointed one of the council, for &s;ettling and e&s;tabli&s;hing the colony of Virginia, with very full powers for the government of that colony, as by that commi&s;&s;ion appears.</P>
<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of King Charles I, to the throne, Mr. Abbot was the fir&s;t per&s;on upon whom he con|ferred the honour of knighthood, and &s;o great was his intere&s;t at that time in the city, that we find him cho&s;en to the fir&s;t parliament called in that King's reign, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1625, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir Heneage Finch, and Mr. Robert Bateman.</P>
<P>In 1627, he was one of the Sheriffs of London, with Henry Garway; Sir Cuthbert Hacket, being then Mayor.</P>
<P>About the year 1635, he erected the monument to the memory of his brother the Archbi&s;hop, in his native town of Guildford.</P>
<P>In 1638 he was Lord-Mayor of the city of Lond|on; on which account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">here was publi&s;hed by Sir T. Heywood, a de&s;cription of his &s;olemn entry.</P>
<P>On the tenth of January, 1640, he departed this life. No farther particulars are to be met with, ex|cept that he was a great lover and encourager of trade, as well as fortunate therein.</P>
<P>He had a &s;on who&s;e name was George, fellow of Merton college in Oxford, and who took the degree of Bachelor of Law in 1630.</P>
