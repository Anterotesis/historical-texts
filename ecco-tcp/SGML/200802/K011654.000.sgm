<HEAD>TO <HI>The mo&s;t in&s;olent Man living.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the crowd of &s;ympathiz|ing friends, who affect to lament your downfall, but who have by their advice and influence &s;o effectually contributed to it, will you permit a &s;tranger to ap|proach, and &s;peak a language which few great men wi&s;h to hear, and none of their followers dare to utter?</P>
<P>It is not, Sir, the whining cant of impotent condo|lence,&mdash;it is not the &s;elfi&s;h &s;igh, which bur&s;ts from the bo&s;om without affecting the heart,&mdash;it is not the anticipating groan for a place about to be re&s;igned, or
<PB N="6" REF="4">
a &s;inecure &s;natched from the hand which had al|ready gra&s;ped it;&mdash;it is&mdash;&s;tart not!&mdash;it is the Voice of TRUTH, which, however you may pretend to de&s;pi&s;e it, will vibrate through the &s;hades of retire|ment, and from who&s;e penetrating &s;hafts you will fly to Holwood in vain.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that every effect &s;hould be equal to the object which it means to attain; if the impor|tance of <HI>your</HI> views is to be judged of by this axiom, how <HI>exalted</HI> mu&s;t they be! how <HI>high</HI> are they to be rated! with <HI>&s;uch</HI> &s;acrifices as you have made, &s;o zealous an <HI>high-prie&s;t</HI> as you are,&mdash;the deity you wor&s;hip mu&s;t be powerful, and the gifts he be&s;tows invaluable.</P>
<P>Yet, if after the prophetic vi&s;ions of your oracle, and the gilded &s;cenes of a warm imagination, you &s;hould find, too late, that you have been deceived; if the &s;plendid fabric of the daemon vani&s;hes into &s;moke,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
what mu&s;t be your feelings and &s;ituation, when for honours, rewards, and perpetual &s;way, nothing remains but popular indignation, infamy, and ruin!</P>
<P>Without an hand to heal your wounds, or an heart to &s;hare in your &s;orrows, the balm of an addre&s;s will then be poured forth in vain; Jenkin&s;on de&s;erts you, for the ear which li&s;tened to him is deaf; the <HI>mode&s;t</HI> Dundas will not then be heard, nor &s;hall the gentle Sydney avail.</P>
<P>The uxorious Marquis will fly to his nuptial bower, and &s;eek in the arms of beauty for tho&s;e plea&s;ures which ambition and power can no longer be&s;tow, and which once even Hymen denied.</P>
<P>I will not offend by de&s;cribing the manner in which, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent pride of your deportment, you <HI>crept</HI> into power; nor will I confu&s;e the placid &s;e|renity of your cou&s;in, the good Marquis of Buckingham,
<PB N="8" REF="6">
by recounting the &s;peedy rewards that followed his well|timed private &s;ervices.&mdash;The&s;e, with <Q REND="inline">"the inva&s;ion of chartered rights,"</Q> that political tali&s;man, by which in &s;o ma&s;terly a manner you deluded a whole nation, have had their day.<Q>"Il y a un germe du rai&s;on qui commence a &s;e developer."</Q></P>
<P>The eyes of the people are opened, the mi&s;ts are gradually di&s;per&s;ed by the radiance of the RISING SUN, and tho&s;e who were duped by, and tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in your <HI>artifices,</HI> can no longer be managed.</P>
<P>The curtain was drawn up, and di&s;covered you, the REFORMER of PARLIAMENTARY CORRUPTION&mdash;that fatal mea&s;ure for which you had pledged your&s;elf, when the down had &s;carcely covered your cheek.</P>
<P>This trap for the approbation of others, in which you were caught your&s;elf, was devi&s;ed at an ill-&s;tarred moment, when your cold &s;y&s;tematic prudence had <HI>for once</HI> been laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7">
The faint applau&s;e, the adulterate adoption of &s;pu|rious prai&s;e, the zeal which damns, and the lukewarm &s;upport which defeats its purpo&s;e, were avowedly yours.</P>
<P>Thus early you commenced the preparatory farce of in&s;ult, for a people again&s;t whom you meditated the deepe&s;t injury!</P>
<P>The honourable band of merchants in Leadenhall|&s;treet, who have been in the habit of dethroning princes, and &s;etting empires up to &s;ale; who execrated, in the moment of popular frenzy, Mr. Fox, as a bold invader, begin to di&s;cover in indignant whi&s;|pers, that what they would not yield to the undi&s;|gui&s;ed language of &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity, has been pilfered from them by mean fine&s;&s;e and low &s;tratagem.</P>
<P>Happy had it been for this country, could your ambition have been &s;atisfied, to tread in the humble
<PB N="10" REF="8">
track of petty crimes; we &s;hould not then have been enabled to trace your daring &s;pirit, mounting by gradual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from court intrigue, borough jobbing, and a con&s;piracy with tea brokers, to in|fringe the con&s;titution of your country, and in&s;ult the Heir Apparent of your Sovereign.</P>
<P>I would make every allowance for an amiable Queen, di&s;tracted with affliction and &s;orrow for the calamity of the be&s;t of hu&s;bands; but &s;urely &s;ome decorum was due to a young Prince, on whom the future hopes of the nation re&s;t, who&s;e mind was harrowed by filial di&s;tre&s;s, and who&s;e conduct on this occa|&s;ion even you and his bittere&s;t enemies cannot but approve.</P>
<P>Was it right, was it decent, for a CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT of the Crown to addre&s;s the Prince of Wales to the following purport?</P>

"I have been a tool, but am now re&s;olved to re&s;ume a new character. If you refu&s;e, I have a &s;harp and powerful weapon in my hands: I have erected a fortre&s;s in the very &s;eat of power, a citadel which commands every avenue of your capital; it is com|pletely &s;tored with men, money, and provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>"From the moment of my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, I will intrench my&s;elf and adherents; and as the wheels of &s;tate at all times, in a limited monarchy, revolve with dif|ficulty, I am re&s;olved (notwith&s;tanding my a&s;&s;ur|ances to captivate popular applau&s;e) I am firmly re&s;olved to clog and embarra&s;s them by every means in my power. Under the &s;pecious banners of ten|derne&s;s and re&s;pect for my &s;overeign and his con&s;ort, I will &s;et up a fourth power, however incompatible it may be with the Engli&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>"Nor am I without the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, that
<PB N="13" REF="13">
from the di&s;agreeable conditions annexed to the Regency, you will be induced to refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>"Con&s;cious that <HI>you</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s honour and manly &s;pi|rit, one &s;park of which never in&s;pired <HI>my</HI> brea&s;t, di&s;honourable hints and &s;u&s;picions, which one <HI>gentle|man</HI> would not tolerate from another, &s;hall not be wanting.</P>
<P>"By the&s;e and other <HI>laudable</HI> means, I perhaps may be able to confirm my&s;elf perpetual dictator, and in&s;ure to my&s;elf and advi&s;ers the power and emoluments of government."</P></Q></P>
<P>After &s;uch an addre&s;s, cloathed perhaps in treache|rous and &s;mooth words, to the only per&s;on whom our melancholy &s;ituation points out as your ma&s;ter, let us pau&s;e.&mdash;Will you deny that your cheek turned pale at being told that the Prince <HI>would</HI> accept the
<PB N="14" REF="14">
Regency, notwith&s;tanding your in&s;idious in&s;tructions?&mdash;you &s;tarted like a guilty thing, bit your lip with an|gui&s;h, and confe&s;&s;ed you were undone!</P>
<P>When your new-modelled &s;y&s;tem is put into execu|tion, when the harmle&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harmle&s;s, becau&s;e the Con&s;titution, the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, and the laws already tie up his hands.</NOTE> Regent is bound by di&s;grace|ful Re&s;trictions, which were <HI>you</HI> to be his mini&s;ter never would have been heard of; what defence have we again&s;t YOU, THE MOST PLAUSIBLE, FAIR SPOKEN, BUT MOST DANGEROUS YOUNG MAN THIS KINGDOM EVER BEHELD?</P>
<P>Will it be any protection again&s;t the active malignity of your mi&s;chievous intriguing &s;pirit, to be told that you have &s;ecured the lords of the bedchamber, that a gentleman u&s;her is in no danger of lo&s;ing his place, and that a clerk of the kitchen &s;hall not be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">
Need you be told, with all your merits as a Finan|cier and an economi&s;t, a reputation which by the mo&s;t &s;pecious arts you &s;tole but never de&s;erved, need you be told, at what an expence you have &s;ecured a retreat for your party, and an oppo&s;ition to the Regent?</P>
<P>But in this, as in every other in&s;tance of your life, you have the addre&s;s to di&s;gui&s;e a hateful mini&s;|terial mea&s;ure under an alluring popular ma&s;k.</P>
<P>It would have been too &s;hocking a &s;ight for the good men of the City to &s;ee <HI>you,</HI> the paragon of moral rectitude, the phoenix of expiring cha&s;tity, creating court patronage, and confe&s;&s;ing your&s;elf the humble minion of a petticoat government.</P>
<P>From <HI>you,</HI> who &s;tand forth to &s;tem the torrent of cor|ruption, to re&s;tore the exhau&s;ted finances of a king|dom, far be from <HI>you</HI> &s;uch an unhallowed pur|po&s;e!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">
The dignity of the King's per&s;on is to be pre|&s;erved at <HI>every</HI> expence; the feelings of the nation are to be worked up to a &s;ufficient pitch by a pathetic tale; iron tears run down the brazen face of Pluto; and we are betrayed to con&s;ent to a violation of the con&s;titution!</P>
<P>So &s;ucce&s;sful have your experiments been in im|po&s;ing on the people of this country, that your fruitful mind is ever teeming with new projects of deceit, and as you have played your part &s;o often without detection, you &s;till per&s;evere in my&s;tery and delay without fear.</P>
<P>Gild but your poi&s;onous pill with a thin out&s;ide of per&s;onal attachment, economy, or commercial advan|tage, and the undi&s;cerning crowd &s;wallow with avidity the no&s;trums, and the poli&s;hed periods of the quack.</P>
<P>In politics, as in quackery, tumid promi&s;es, and irra|tional
<PB N="17" REF="17">
credulity re&s;i&s;t and triumph over the evidence of the mo&s;t &s;tubborn facts.</P>
<P>Surrounded with di&s;ea&s;e and death, the deluded pa|tient will &s;carcely bear to be told, that the remedy is as injurious as it is deceiving, and that the mountebank is a contemptible pretender.</P>
<P>Your countrymen, Sir, find with &s;orrow and &s;ur|prize, that you &s;ub&s;titute declamation for argument; that in oppo&s;ition to plain facts which &s;tare you in the face, you obtrude a numerical di&s;play of figures and fal&s;e calculations; and in&s;tead of adopting a fair, open line of conduct, evade detection in the intricacies of a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entry, pur&s;ue a dark and crooked path, and, &s;ecure in your <HI>virtuous</HI> majority, are my&s;terious, wa&s;pi&s;h, and in&s;olent.</P>
<P>But the time is near at hand, when your character will be generally under&s;tood, and a plain man may
<PB N="18" REF="18">
venture to a&s;&s;ert, that an immen&s;e unappropriated fund is no proof of &s;kill in finance; that increa&s;ing burthens to dimini&s;h them, is a paradox in politics, and that the deranged and di&s;ordered &s;tate of France cannot po&s;&s;ibly reflect any credit on you as a negociator or a &s;tate&s;|man.</P>
<P>Yet with the&s;e barren materials have your profe&s;&s;ed panegyri&s;ts, who in their attempts to defend, &s;o effec|tually damn your fame; with the&s;e crumbling mate|rials have they e&s;&s;ayed to build you a reputation, which a little time, a little experience, and a little common &s;en&s;e, levels to the ground.</P>
<P>The &s;udden rever&s;e of your fortune holds forth an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to future mini&s;ters; it will teach them to &s;hun tho&s;e meretricious arts which you have &s;o inef|fectually practi&s;ed, to procure the name without the e&s;&s;ence of patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
Few men ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a greater degree than your&s;elf the attracting glitter of tin&s;el, the gewgaw glare of foil, &s;o attractive to women and children, but none were ever le&s;s qualified to pa&s;s through the try|ing furnace of the refiner; every criterion of &s;terling metal was wanting to &s;tamp it into real value; the counterfeit is quickly di&s;covered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his Maje&s;ty's countenance no longer &s;hines upon it,"</Q> and it in|&s;tantly cea&s;es to be current.</P>
<P>You were &s;eated at the helm in the prime of life, with &s;trong hope, youthful ardour, family pride, and an indulgent King at your di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>With fair probability you might have looked for|ward to a long admini&s;tration, and in a few years might have filled every department of church and &s;tate (if any &s;uch remained unfilled) with relations and fa|mily dependants.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20">
You might have projected, in riper years and ma|turer judgment, future Iri&s;h Propo&s;itions, without &s;ub|mitting to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of turning them in&s;ide out.</P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;titute for the Shop Tax might have been devi&s;ed, when you had &s;ufficiently gratified your &s;pleen and ill-will again&s;t a particular de&s;cription of men.</P>
<P>Without drawing on your&s;elf the accu&s;ation of ma|lice and ob&s;tinacy, you might in &s;ome other more in|genious way have gratified your revenge, under the cover of increa&s;ing the revenue; in time, perhaps, your pertinacious adherence to this hated and partial op|pre&s;&s;ion might have been forgot.</P>
<P>Perhaps a &s;econd Commutation Bill (be not unea&s;y for I will not dwell long on the &s;ubject) a &s;econd Com|mutation Bill would have pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and have enabled you to deceive the public by a vi&s;ionary pro|&s;pect of advantages it never produced.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">
For the &s;ake of putting two or three millions into the pockets of a monopolizing company, who I confe&s;s have not been ungrateful to you, you were guilty of an unwarrantable deception, and transferred a valuable portion of commercial profit to foreign markets.</P>
<P>I will not deny that you told us, this your favourite ma&s;ter-&s;troke of &s;hallow policy would extirpate &s;mug|gling root and branch, and give us in tea (your favour|ite beverage) what you robbed us of for light; un|fortunately the contraband trade revives with more than its u&s;ual vigour, and the &s;ales at the India Hou&s;e feelingly tell us how cheap we are to expect our teas.</P>
<P>Had it been your happy lot to have remained longer in office, what advantageous pro&s;pects were in view! in time you might have matured into &s;ome apology for the in&s;ignificance of the abilities of your brother; his tutor at the Admiralty might not again have experienced
<PB N="22" REF="22">
&s;o di&s;graceful a repul&s;e at We&s;tmin&s;ter; the &s;urly brow of the Chancellor might have been &s;moothed; the ex|travagant chimeras of the gunpowder genius re&s;trained by a little common &s;en&s;e, and Camden &s;ooner or later, after your repeated entreaties, might have been pre|vailed on to hold his tongue.</P>
<P>With &s;uch de&s;irable events in view, how cruel is your di&s;appointment?&mdash;alas, the&s;e enchanting pro|&s;pects are no more! the fountain of your honour is dry, the &s;ource of your influence is deranged, and you already totter in your &s;eat.</P>
<P>Your every hope is bla&s;ted, the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair &s;ucceeds to the in&s;olence of office; and the &s;ceptre which for more than three months you have &s;o firmly gra&s;ped, you mu&s;t, however reluctantly, at la&s;t re|&s;ign after all your impotent endeavours to prevent another's wielding it with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
Like Mrs. Nichol&s;on, you aim your knife at the con&s;titution, wrapped up in the flim&s;y texture of loy|alty and prudential caution, and I hope the de&s;tructive ab&s;urdity of the attempt will be defeated by the watch|ful guardians of the con&s;titution, and the weakne&s;s of the hand which gives the blow.</P>
<P>Though the path of greatne&s;s and glory is barred again&s;t you as a mini&s;ter and &s;tate&s;man for ever, na|ture, and indeed your education, have eminently qua|lified you for the bar; in the Hou&s;e, you are too well known to be able any longer to impo&s;e on the coun|try gentlemen, your boa&s;ted majorities dwindle apace.</P>
<P>The Court of King's Bench, where your friend pre&s;ides, opens its friendly doors; with your tie-wig, your bag, and the fourth part of an hackney-coach, you may &s;ink with &s;afety into a re&s;pectable barri&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e arts which you have &s;o unhappily exerted
<PB N="24" REF="24">
again&s;t your Prince and your country, will be valued by &s;olicitors and attornies.&mdash;With pompous diction, &s;tudied phra&s;eology, and hackney'd forms of words, you may &s;ooth the &s;lumbers of a pui&s;ne judge, and mi&s;lead a petty jury; you may command the attention of Lord Kenyon, and probably excite his gratitude. The Ma&s;ter of the Rolls will not turn up his <HI>no&s;e</HI> at you, if the Chancellor, who complains of &s;uch an <HI>incumbrance,</HI> conde&s;cends to leave him any thing to do.</P>
<P>With all your powers of face, can you dare to a&s;&s;ert that &s;plendour and external dignity are proper, con&s;i&s;tent, or even compatible with the horrors of coercion, the darkened room, the bold E------, and his de&s;perate crew?</P>
<P>In pity, Sir, to human nature, in pity to the pro&s;|trate maje&s;ty of kings, tear not a&s;ide with a rude hand the whole&s;ome veil which covers the misfortunes of
<PB N="25" REF="25">
our Sovereign, nor endeavour by mock-&s;olemnity and a &s;uperfluous di&s;play of wretched pageantry, to throw a ridicule on national di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;aid you were a dangerous young man; to which I will add, that you are a mo&s;t daring and haughty one.</P>
<P>It is not your private life, correct beyond the ex|ample of modern times, it is not that forbidding un&s;o|cial virtue, for which you are indebted to the coldne&s;s of your con&s;titution, that I have any right or inclina|tion to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The traits in your character, which excite the ap|prehen&s;ions of all unprejudiced men, are the &s;pecious buckram of &s;entiment, the &s;ententious gravity, the &s;anctified grimace, and plau&s;ible exterior of &s;elf-impor|tance; ob&s;tinacy, which no rea&s;oning or expediency can convince; and a boundle&s;s ambition, which no
<PB N="26" REF="26">
private man can po&s;&s;e&s;s without danger to the com|munity.</P>
<P>Again&s;t a combination of &s;uch dangerous qualities I would wi&s;h my countrymen to be guarded; a man of your de&s;cription is &s;o well qualified, as a mini&s;ter, to ruin his country, under pretence of pre&s;erving it; and in oppo&s;ition, &s;o much in the habit of retarding the mea&s;ures of government, by tampering with bed|chamber women, and cultivating back-&s;tairs influence, that you cannot be provided again&s;t too cautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>With all the apparent purity of your principles and declarations, with all your affected &s;cruples, you are not a&s;hamed to practi&s;e the corrupt arts of the mo&s;t profligate mini&s;ter, and to dabble in the mo&s;t de&s;pi|cable manoeuvres.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be your fate hereafter to &s;lumber away your old age in the Upper Hou&s;e,<Q>"In vulgum ambiguas &s;pargere voces,"</Q> <PB N="27" REF="27">
&s;hall be your motto; while a &s;tarched puritan with a hand in each pocket, and a double-faced Janus, looking like Mr. Wilkes two ways at once, &s;hall be your cha|racteri&s;tic &s;upporters.</P>
<P>With what decency, with what propriety could you be &s;o in&s;olent as to introduce the mention of the King's private property, when you knew at the &s;ame time (yes, and your confidential Secretary well knew), that the Prince could not, without your good-natured officiou&s;ne&s;s, have the lea&s;t controul over it?</P>
<P>It was a cruel piece of policy; but like every other action of your life, carried a &s;educing fair-faced rea|&s;on on the &s;urface of it, which, at the &s;ame time it played your old game of catching popular applau&s;e, wounded the feelings of a Prince, out of who&s;e power you had put it ever to employ you, by this outrage on his character as a gentleman or a man.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28">
It was one of tho&s;e convenient legal inuendos, which I pre&s;ume you learnt at the Temple, by which a &s;kilful cro&s;s-examining coun&s;el might irreparably in|jure a man's good name, without &s;aying one word again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The uncorrupt, the virtuous young man, wi&s;hes for nothing more than to guard this <HI>ample</HI> provi&s;ion for the Royal Offspring, he (heaven protect him!) had no purpo&s;e to an&s;wer by circulating this vile a&s;per&s;ion, he could have no views in &s;owing the &s;eeds of &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t in the public mind.</P>
<P>What but the mo&s;t amiable motives could influence his conduct, by inculcating the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>preventing</HI> the Prince from <HI>robbing</HI> his father?</P>
<P>But, Sir, I tru&s;t a generous nation will be as ready to give credit to a young Prince, the lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or of his father, as to a Mini&s;ter, who &s;acrifices every thing
<PB N="29" REF="29">
to a &s;elfi&s;h love of office, who&s;e admini&s;tration com|menced in fraud, continued in delu&s;ion, and ends in endeavours to mould the &s;acred forms of our con&s;titu|tion into a democratic ari&s;tocracy, or a con&s;ular re|public.</P>
<P>It is the fa&s;hion for you and your friends to lament in &s;trains of pity, <Q REND="inline">"that wor&s;t of in&s;olence,"</Q> the licen|tious conduct of the Prince.</P>
<P>Every one, with the <HI>feelings</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of a <HI>man,</HI> mu&s;t allow for his age and &s;ituation. Fettered in the di&s;gu&s;ting forms of royalty, he cannot gratify his wi&s;hes in the nuptial path: But nature, (perhaps I &s;peak unintelligible to <HI>you</HI>) all powerful nature <HI>will</HI> vindicate her rights.</P>
<P>He loves a fine woman, enjoys the amu&s;ements of the turf, and &s;pends his income as becomes a Prince, in encouraging the arts, in &s;plendour, elegance, and ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="30">
The &s;cience of <HI>accumulation</HI> he may learn and prac|ti&s;e at &s;ome remote period; and however his expences may exceed his income, <HI>he has very fair precedents for me&s;&s;ages to the Commons for more money.</HI></P>
<P>You are &s;aid occa&s;ionally to amu&s;e your lei&s;ure hours with a novel; perhaps, while you have been &s;ipping your tea, Fielding's Tom Jones has occa&s;ionally occupied your attention.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that you can have caught &s;ome congenial traits in the character of Blifil, and that you think them worthy of imitation?</P>
<P>While Jones was indulging the generous propen&s;i|ties of youthful ardour, and experiencing the amiable weakne&s;s of human nature, his good, cha&s;te, moral, &s;ober friend Blifil was ruining him with his benefactor Allworthy, and con&s;piring again&s;t his fame, his fortune, and his life.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
But it is time to take my leave, which I &s;hall do with a &s;hort que&s;tion.</P>
<P>You &s;ay you will not oppo&s;e the Regent, <HI>but when you think he does wrong:</HI>&mdash;Shall you ever think an ad|mini&s;tration which you do not direct can do right?</P>
<P>After this declaration, which has left &s;uch ample room for &s;ubterfuge, can we be &s;urprized to &s;ee you conducting a regular preconcerted plan of oppo&s;ition?</P>
<P>The kind condoler, the cabinet coun&s;ellor of a fa|ther and a mother, will reconcile his duty to his inte|re&s;t, and harra&s;s and perplex the mea&s;ures of their &s;on.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, you may again expect to hear from</P>
