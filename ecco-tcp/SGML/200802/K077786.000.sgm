<HEAD>THE ABSOLUTE AND INDISPENSIBLE DUTY of CHRISTIANS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN and FELLOW-CHRISTIANS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. SO I would call and love ALL and every one, without the lea&s;t regard to name, &s;ect or party, who believe the &s;acred truths of the bible, hope in the precious promi&s;es of God in Chri&s;t, and obey his holy commands in love. This faith, hope, love and obedience, con&s;titute the true Chri&s;tian. If any of the&s;e be wanting, the Chri&s;tian character is de&s;ective. The Chri&s;tian dares no more to cavil again&s;t, and wilfully di&s;o|bey any one command of God, than he dates to call in que&s;tion, any of the &s;acred truths of God.
<PB N="4" REF="3">
For faith binds, hope confirms, and love con&s;trains to univer&s;al obedience to God's laws. Therefore, the Chri&s;tian e&s;teems his bible as the warrant for his faith, the ground of his hope, and the rule of his conduct. And there is no one &s;tation of life, but the word of God commands how we &s;hould act in it: no one circum&s;tance in life, but it di|rects how we &s;hould behave under it. Therefore, obedience to the revealed will of God, and a con|cern for his glory, is, and ever will be, e&s;teemed by all Chri&s;tians, the primary and chief object of their attention and regard.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;uch, I would humbly addre&s;s &s;ome few words, re&s;pecting their conduct in the pre&s;ent day, when the voice of the multitude is heard on high, crying out for LIBERTY. Upon you, O Chri&s;tians, would I call, in &s;cripture language, ARM YOUR|SELVES&mdash;IT IS HIGH TIME&mdash;QUIT YOURSELVES LIKE MEN.</P>
<P><HI>Arm your&s;elves,</HI> in your own defence, with the word of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, on the right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">and and on the left, &s;o as not to &s;in again&s;t your
<PB N="5" REF="4">
God. Arm your&s;elves, with the &s;ame mind which that word requires of you, and expects from you, &s;o as to obey and plea&s;e God. <HI>It is high time,</HI> when the voice of licentiou&s;ne&s;s is heard, and a liberty to violate the precepts of your God abounds, for you to be zealous for his glory, and to beware, le&s;t you follow the multitude to do evil. <HI>Quit your&s;elves like men,</HI> who fear God, and act under the influ|ence of his holy commands.</P>
<P N="3">3. Would you exerci&s;e your&s;elves, to have a con&s;cience void of offence, both towards God and man, re&s;pecting your conduct in the pre&s;ent day? beware of your &s;pirit and temper. See that both be under the rule and direction of God's word. It is at our peril to di&s;obey the plain, po&s;itive, and expre&s;s commands of our God. The bible is our be&s;t rule in <HI>politics.</HI> No other &s;cheme of <HI>politics</HI> &s;hall I pre&s;ume to meddle with or recommend. That teaches, that requires us to be <HI>religious politi|cians,</HI> &s;o as at all times, in all places, and under all circum&s;tances, from obedient hearts to our God, with loyalty and affection to his Maje&s;ty, to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;hout with united voices, GOD SAVE THE KING! This is the &s;pirit and temper which the bible in|&s;pires.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, our love of, and loyalty to our King, ari&s;es from the con&s;ideration that God hath &s;et him over us. Love and loyalty to him, are not impo&s;ed on us by the authority of fallible men only, but chiefly, from the po&s;itive commands of our Al|mighty God. Therefore, love and loyalty to the King, is our ab&s;olute and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty. And a &s;pirit and temper contrary to this, is not only in|con&s;i&s;tent with the faith of a Chri&s;tian, but al&s;o a violation of the expre&s;s commands of our God. Had I not &s;een and heard, with deep concern, and heart felt &s;orrow, &s;uch a &s;pirit and temper exalted in tho&s;e whom I love, and from whom I hoped better things, I &s;hould have been &s;ilent on this &s;ubject, and not have troubled you with this AD|DRESS. But, &s;eeing things are &s;o, is there not a cau&s;e? bear with me in love, I befeech you. Be not offended with me, I pray you. I would wil|lingly offend no one. I de&s;ire to follow peace with all men. But, duty to my God, allegiance to my King, and a real concern for your good, unitedly
<PB N="7" REF="6">
con&s;train me thus to addre&s;s, and earne&s;tly entreat you, calmly to con&s;ider what is required of us, what is expected from us, as our duty, both in re&s;pect to our GOD, and our KING. I am inclined to think, and willing to hope, that the failing of Chri&s;tians herein, ari&s;es from want of due con&s;ide|ration, and clo&s;e attention to the expre&s;s com|mands of God in his holy word. For, we are mo&s;t &s;olemnly enjoined,</P>
<L>To honour the King.</L>
<L>To pray for the King.</L>
<L>To be &s;ubject to the King.</L>
<P N="5">5. Let us, therefore, my fellow-chri&s;tians, as in the pre&s;ence of God, before whom we mu&s;t &s;hortly appear, and to whom we mu&s;t all ac|count, Con&s;ider the&s;e points.</P>
<P>1&s;t, HONOUR THE KING, 1 Pet. ii. 17. As this command &s;tands clo&s;ely connected with another, FEAR GOD, does it not therefore in&s;tantly &s;trike our minds with this idea? if we fear God we &s;hall honour the King: If the King is not honoured of us, God is not feared by us. There is a clo&s;e and in&s;eparable
<PB N="8" REF="7">
connection between the&s;e commands. Both are enforced under the &s;anction of the &s;ame authority, the word of God. If we are influenced by the former, we &s;hall obey the latter. What God hath joined together, let no man dare to put a&s;under.</P>
<P N="6">6. But who was King when this command was given to the primitive Chri&s;tians to honour him? Even NERO, that wicked tyrant, that cruel per&s;ecutor, that inveterate enemy to Chri&s;tians. What! honour &s;uch a wretch! Did you ever hear or read of &s;uch an objection, from the mouth of any one of the primitive Chri&s;tians? Can you produce one &s;ingle in&s;tance, of any one of the apo&s;tles, or fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, &s;peaking evil of dignities, or re|fu&s;ing to honour them, however cruelly they were treated by them? Nay, was it not their con&s;tant doctrine and practice, Render honour to whom ho|nour is due? Rom. xiii. 7. Therefore, this com|mand to honour &s;uch a King as Nero was, is a blow at the heart, a &s;tab to the vitals, a death|wound to every objection again&s;t obeying this command, "Honour the King."</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="9" REF="8">
7. But, be the King what he may, our duty to God is the &s;ame. Think of him as you plea&s;e, yet this di&s;&s;olves not your obligation to obey God's command. God has not &s;ent an angel to reign over us, but a man of like pa&s;&s;ions with our&s;elves. I love and honour the King for his princely vir|tues and amiable qualities. It is neither your duty nor mine to think, &s;peak, or hear of any faults he may be accu&s;ed, le&s;t we get di&s;affected to him. Let us look at home, mend our own, and we &s;hall be much better employed. For it is adding to the num|ber of our &s;ins, to di&s;obey God, by not honouring the King. Let us, therefore, do our duty, obey God's command, honour our King, and &s;o &s;hall we plea&s;e our God. Let us think well, and &s;peak well of him asone whom God has cho&s;en, exalted, and &s;et over us. For, he &s;ays, "By ME kings reign." Prov. viii. 15. Con&s;ider that word.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the apo&s;tle exhorts, "Children obey your parents," he adds, <HI>in the Lord.</HI> Ephe&s;. vi. 1. As it is the mind and will of the Lord, the com|mand of the Lord, well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, and makes for his glory, therefore &s;hould be done for
<PB N="10" REF="9">
his &s;ake. So let us honour the King <HI>in the Lord.</HI> Obey our Lord, by honouring the King, as it is his mind and will, is his command, is well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, is to his glory, and &s;hould be done for the Lord's &s;ake. So Peter exhorts, "Submit to the King for the <HI>Lord's &s;ake."</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 13. This is to honour the King in faith, as believing him to be &s;et over us <HI>in the Lord.</HI> And this faith works by love, and will lead us to honour the King in love.</P>
<P N="9">9. Love, covers the multitude of faults. Love thinketh no evil, &s;peaketh no evil, heareth no evil again&s;t the King. Love puts the be&s;t con&s;tructions upon the behaviour, hides faults with its vail, and ca&s;ts a mantle of kindne&s;s over failings. Like the painter (I think Apelles) who drew the picture of Alexander with his finger upon the &s;car on his face: &s;o love has a finger to hide &s;cars and ble|mi&s;hes, and cover failings and infirmities. Does the Lord command us, Thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour as thy&s;elf? What love then is due from us to our King? &s;uch love as will carry out our af|fections towards him, &s;o as that we &s;hall think no
<PB N="11" REF="10">
ill, &s;peak no ill, hear no ill again&s;t him, and totally di&s;regard all di&s;loyal reports concerning him. Love will re&s;train us from doing any thing to grieve his royal heart, or cau&s;e the crown to &s;it heavy on his &s;acred head. Yea, love will make us active in doing every thing in our power to honour the King, con&s;i&s;tent with the duty we owe him, the allegi|ance we are bound in to him, and the honour we are commended by our God to give him. Vain and &s;pecious only, are all profe&s;&s;ions of love, honour and reverence to the King, while we entertain groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions of him, and pur&s;ue &s;uch &s;teps as tend to di&s;turb his peace, or perplex his government. But the enquiry of an obedient heart to our God, and of a loving loyal heart to our King, will be, what &s;hall be done to the man whom the KING OF KINGS delighteth to honour? our duty, as Chri&s;tians, binds us, our love, as Chri&s;tians, con&s;trains us thus to honour our King. And, therefore, of you, my brethren and fellow-chri&s;tians, may I not in the apo&s;tle's words de|mand? &s;hew me your faith by your works. Make it manife&s;t that you do believe in God, by your
<PB N="12" REF="11">
obedience to this his &s;acred command, HONOUR THE KING. If you do, you will,</P>
<P N="10">10. Secondly, Pray for the King. We are &s;o|lemnly enjoined, by God's &s;acred word, to pray for Kings, and for all who are in authority. 1 Tim. ii. 2. This I am po&s;itively &s;ure of, were there more praying for the King, there would be le&s;s evil &s;peaking again&s;t the King: and were there more faith in God's word, there would be more obedience to his will and command, in more cor|dially honouring, and heartily praying for the King. In doing this, we not only obey God's word, but we honour THE KING OF KINGS, by carrying our King's cau&s;e, pre&s;enting his per&s;on and intere&s;t, and the concerns of his kingdom at the throne of God's grace, referring all the&s;e matters to him, &s;eeking every ble&s;&s;ing and direction from him, and leaving all events with him. O this praying for the King, would not only expel the rancorous &s;eeds of rebellion, which are &s;o rife in our corrupt natures; but would al&s;o, more heartily conciliate our affections to the King, and heighten our e&s;teem of him.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
There is a mighty power in prayer, to charm away all evil thoughts of the per&s;on we pray for, and to beget love to him, and e&s;teem of him. All who try the experiment, prove the truth of the doctrine. Do not you neglect it.</P>
<P N="11">11. But, adds the apo&s;tle, as a cogent rea&s;on for this duty,&mdash;<Q>"That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. For, this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour." <BIBL>1 Tim. ii. 2. 3.</BIBL></Q> I am not addre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who live in the total neglect of prayer. It is not to be expected, that tho&s;e who do not pray for them&s;elves, will either pray for the king, or any one el&s;e. From &s;uch, I expect no|thing but the contemptuous &s;neer, and the indignant frown, for all I have &s;aid upon the chri&s;tian's duty. This I can bear. Such I can pity. Becau&s;e, they &s;ee not their own mercies, but &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e God's &s;acred truths, and &s;olemn commands. Yet, even &s;uch I &s;hould be &s;orry, de&s;ignedly to offend. But, it is YOU, my fellow chri&s;tians, to whom I appeal: YOU, who love and delight to do that which is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God
<PB N="14" REF="13">
our Saviour, and de&s;ire to lead a quiet and peace|able life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. YOU, can|not but &s;ee, how clo&s;ely connected your duty of praying for the king, and for all in authority is, with the enjoyment of the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings and precious mercies, quietne&s;s, peace, godline&s;s, and hone&s;ty. Whence, tho&s;e tumults, di&s;cords, di&s;|tractions, di&s;affection to government, ungodline&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty, which are &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to God our Saviour? do they not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and will they not increa&s;e among us, while the duty of praying for the king, and for all in authority, is neglected by us? But, the man of prayer, will pray them away from his heart, and will live them down in his life. For all &s;uch, will,</P>
<P N="12">12. Thirdly, Submit to the king. For, we are commanded, <Q>"Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers." <BIBL>Rom. xiii. 1.</BIBL></Q> Here is a po&s;itive, and comprehen&s;ive precept. No one can plead exemp|tion from it. It is enforced with the mo&s;t powerful rea&s;on, why every one &s;hould obey it.&mdash;<Q>"For, there is no power, but of God. The powers that be, are ordained of God."</Q> And this pre|cept
<PB N="15" REF="14">
is backed with a mo&s;t &s;evere threatning.&mdash;<Q>"Who&s;oever, therefore, re&s;i&s;teth the power, re|&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God, and they who re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves DAMNATION."</Q> Pray, now, do not ri&s;e in anger, rebel in wrath, and cry out in fury, "I cannot bear this; away with it, this is the ob&s;olete, long &s;ince exploded doctrine, of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> which neither we, nor our forefathers couldbear!" Bap|tize it by what hard name you plea&s;e: call it, <HI>&s;candalum magnatum</HI> if you will; Still, this will not de&s;troy its divine authority, di&s;&s;olve your obligati|on to obey it, nor rever&s;e the &s;entence of wrath denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who di&s;obey it.</P>
<P N="13">13. As to pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;t|ance, as a mere human doctrine, taught and con|tended for by any man, I know nothing about it. I never read one page of human compo&s;ition for, or again&s;t it, nor do I think, ever &s;hall. But, if you plea&s;e, this divine precept, &s;hall pa&s;s under your title, <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance.</HI> Is there any thing &s;o very formidable, &s;o very dread|ful to a chri&s;tian's ear, or a chri&s;tian's heart, to be
<PB N="16" REF="15">
pa&s;&s;ively obedient to God's holy word, to be non-re&s;i&s;tant to all his &s;acred commands? Why, then, this tragical outcry, again&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king, &s;ubjection to the higher powers? Sure I am, it carries this &s;anction from the mouths and pens of all God's holy prophets and apo&s;tles, SO WE TAUGHT. It bears this impre&s;s from the tongues of all primitive chri&s;tians, AND SO WE BELIEVED. And, it is enjoined us, by the mo&s;t powerful, mo&s;t endearing, and mo&s;t engaging motive&mdash;"Sub|mit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man, whether it be to the King as Supreme: Or unto governors which are &s;ent by him for&mdash;THE LORD'S SAKE." 1 Pet. ii. 13. 14.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>For the Lord's &s;ake.</HI> Chri&s;tians, how do your hearts feel, at the urging this plea, and ad|vancing this motive, for your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the King, and &s;ubjection to the higher powers? can you re&s;i&s;t it? dare you reject it? where then is your faith in, and love to your Lord? you are called to a duty, which however irk&s;ome to fle&s;h and blood, however contrary to human pride and carnal rea&s;onings, however oppo&s;ed by men of
<PB N="17" REF="16">
corrupt minds, who know not God, and reject his revealed word; yet to YOU it comes enforced with this mo&s;t &s;olemn, this mo&s;t prevailing rea&s;on, for, THE LORD'S SAKE: As though the apo&s;tle had &s;aid, for the &s;ake of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom you believe in as your Saviour, who taught you to render unto Cae&s;ar, the things which are Cae&s;ar's, for the honour of the profe&s;&s;ion you make of him, by the obedience you owe to him, for the &s;ake of the glory you are bound to give him, for the hope you have in him, the expectation you have from him, and, as you will an&s;wer it at the la&s;t day, when you &s;hall be judged by him, act agreeable to your character, as bearing his name, and be obedient to his laws, by &s;ubmitting your&s;elves unto the King for his &s;ake, and being &s;ubject unto the higher powers, for the honour and glory of him.</P>
<P N="15">15. Surely, you will not evade the force of this, and object and &s;ay, as a deep &s;ighted <HI>politician,</HI> and &s;elf-denying <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> once did, when I was urging this doctrine: "True, the fir&s;t chri&s;ti|ans, were in an infantile &s;tate, few in number,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and weak in power, therefore, for them to be thus &s;ubject, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves, was wi&s;e and po|litic; but, now the ca&s;e is altered: As we have power and &s;trength &s;ufficient to right our&s;elves, we ought to u&s;e them in our own cau&s;e." I admire his cunning, while I marvel how any who profe&s;s to be Chri&s;tians, and to believe the bible, can rea&s;on thus. A &s;mall interpolation would ju&s;t adapt the ancient &s;cripture to his modern ta&s;te: for, when Paul &s;ays, "Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers," it is only to add, until they have &s;ufficient power to re&s;i&s;t them, and ca&s;t off &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to them. Is not this to trifle with the &s;o|&s;olemn, invariable commands of a holy, jealous, &s;in-avenging God? Who that fears God, would dare act thus by the 5th commandment, and ca&s;t off all duty to his parents, becau&s;e he is of years to help him&s;elf?</P>
<P N="16">16. But, the apo&s;tle adds, <Q>"Wherefore, ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake." <BIBL>Rom. xiii. 6.</BIBL></Q> That adage, "con&s;cience makes cowards of us all," in &s;ome &s;ortholds good inre&s;pect to the Chri&s;tian's conduct:
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Con&s;cience makes the Chri&s;tian a coward in any &s;ervice which is contrary to the will and com|mands of his God. But, a good con&s;cience to|wards God, in&s;pires him with the true&s;t courage, the greate&s;t fortitude, and the bolde&s;t magnanimity in his &s;ervice. Therefore the Chri&s;tian cannot, dare not commence a traitor to his King, and a rebel again&s;t his government, for he knows he would thereby &s;ubject him&s;elf to the wrath of the higher powers, and expo&s;e him&s;elf to the puni&s;hment of the whole&s;ome and penal laws enacted again&s;t &s;uch conduct. But, be&s;ides this fear of wrath, he has a higher and more noble principle, from which he acts, in &s;ubmitting to his King, and being &s;ubject to the higher powers, even for con&s;cience &s;ake; con&s;ci|ence towards God. To honour and obey the King, to pray for him, to &s;ubmit to him, and to be &s;ub|ject to the higher powers under him, all this to the Chri&s;tian is a con&s;cientious matter. Therefore he mu&s;t <HI>needs be</HI> &s;ubject. The peace of his con&s;ci|ence is at &s;take. To act contrary to God's will, would not only deprive him of God's peace in his con&s;cience, but bring the &s;en&s;e of guilt, the fear of wrath, and the terror of condemnation upon
<PB N="20" REF="19">
him. See then, the clo&s;e connection there is, be|tween obeying the will of God, in &s;ubmitting to the King, and enjoying peace of con&s;cience from God.</P>
<P N="17">17. Now, here we &s;ee what is true patrio|ti&s;m, Bible, Chri&s;tian patrioti&s;m. A true patriot fears God, and is obedient to his commands: He honours the King, prays for the King, and &s;ub|mits to the King, not only for fear of wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake; con&s;cience towards God. Becau&s;e, this is the command and will of God. All &s;uch are true patriots, real lovers of their country, and all &s;uch are worthy of reverence and honour. But all patrioti&s;m without this, is mere farce and &s;pecious pretence: Bomba&s;t, great &s;welling words of vanity, by which they allure, &s;ays St. Peter. 2 Pet. ii. 18. Such patrioti&s;m is begun without principle, is carried on without the fear of God, and will end in &s;hame and confu&s;ion. To talk of &s;uch being true patriots, real lovers of their country, who do not fear God and honour the King, but are open enemies to God, by wicked works, re|minds us of Satan transforming him&s;elf into an angel of light.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="21" REF="20">
18. As our bible gives us the character of true patriots, real lovers of their country, &s;o it al&s;o laysdown a full de&s;cription of mock, and pretended ones, that we may beware of them, be armed again&s;t them, and not be beguiled by them. Says St. Peter, "They walk after the fle&s;h, in the lu&s;t of uncleanne&s;s," and <HI>de&s;pi&s;e government,</HI> pre&s;umptuous are they, and <HI>&s;elf-willed.</HI> They are not afraid <HI>to &s;peak evil of dignities.&mdash;</HI>While they promi&s;e them <HI>liberty,</HI> they them&s;elves are the &s;ervants of cor|ruption. 2 Pet. 10.&mdash;19. With this St. Jude agrees. He &s;cruples not to call them, filthy dream|ers, who defile the fle&s;h, <HI>de&s;pi&s;e dominion, and &s;peak evil of dignities.</HI> Jude 8. Fine patriots! Fine lovers of their country are &s;uch! Should &s;uch per&s;ons &s;tand forth, and a&s;&s;ume the name of patriots, and, with the foul breath of &s;lander, &s;trive to incen&s;e and inflame the minds of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects again&s;t him, <HI>it is high time</HI> to be on our guard: <HI>To arm our&s;elves</HI> with the word of God again&s;t their nefarious de&s;igns; and to <HI>quit our&s;elves like men,</HI> like Chri&s;tians who fear God, and honour the King. It is our wi&s;dom not to be beguiled by them. It is our duty to beware of them, le&s;t we catch the in|fectious,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the wide &s;preading poi&s;on from them, of <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing dominion, and &s;peaking evil of dignities.</HI> For, this is equally as contrary to the word of God, as greatly di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and as highly unbe|coming us as Chri&s;tians, as any of the other &s;ins enumerated.</P>
<P N="19">19. Talk they of liberty! O, ye &s;ons of li|berty, ye warm contenders for freedom, I join hand and heart with you, carry your cau&s;e as high as you will, and extend it as far as you plea&s;e, only, let it be bounded by this &s;acred bar|rier, the law of God, and a good con&s;cience. Be|yond this, what Chri&s;tian dare go? for, all beyond this, is not Chri&s;tian liberty, but lawle&s;s licentiou&s;|ne&s;s: from which we ought mo&s;t heartily to pray, Good Lord, deliver us! And may he <Q>give us grace to obey the King chearfully and willingly, for con&s;cience &s;ake; that, neither our &s;inful pa&s;|&s;ions nor our private intere&s;ts may di&s;appoint his cares for the public good. May he po&s;&s;e&s;s the hearts of his people, that they may never be wanting in honour to his per&s;on, and dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority.</Q> And, &s;eeing the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
commands of, fear God, honour the King, are &s;o clo&s;ely joined, and &s;o in&s;eparably connected, therefore, while with a holy fear of God, and with exultation of heart in him, we &s;hout with the peo|ple of old, "THE LORD HE IS THE GOD. THE LORD HE IS THE GOD," May we add with the &s;ame breath, in loyalty and affection, GOD SAVE THE KING! GOD SAVE THE KING! and let all the people &s;ay, AMEN.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent pro&s;pect of our affairs, is truly melancholy, affecting and alarming. Does not this call loudly upon us to obey this command of God? <Q>"Let all bitterne&s;s, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil &s;peaking be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, hath forgiven you," <BIBL>Eph. iv. 31, 32.</BIBL></Q> Ah, my brethren! &s;ure I am, this would be more plea&s;ing to our God and Saviour, than all that unchri&s;tian, party &s;trife, and fiery contention about politics, which &s;o unhappily prevails among us. Surely, in&s;tead of imputing our troubles to this, and the other cau&s;e, it rather behoves us to con&s;ider our &s;ins, mourn over our &s;ins, humble our&s;elves under
<PB N="24" REF="23">
the mighty hand of God for our &s;ins, and for&s;ake our &s;ins, which are &s;o highly provoking to God, for which he hath a controver&s;y with us, and which are the real ground of our national calamities, and the true cau&s;e of all our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es. <Q>"The Lord's voice crieth unto the city,&mdash;hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it," <BIBL>Micah vi. 9.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is devoutly to bewi&s;hed, that a day may be &s;et apart by authority, for a general fa&s;t, in which we might unitedly humble our&s;elves before God, turn to him, and &s;eek him with our whole hearts, confe&s;s and bewail our &s;ins in his &s;ight, cry mightily unto him to avert impending, de&s;erved judgments from us, direct to &s;ome &s;peedy method of aboli&s;h|ing the pre&s;ent unhappy differences between us and our colonies, &s;o as to prevent the farther effu&s;ion of blood, the dire ravages of war, and conciliate, not only, all matters in di&s;pute between us, but al&s;o our hearty affection to each other. O how earne&s;tly is this to be coveted! Is any thing too hard for the Lord? No; therefore in the faith of this, we ought con&s;tantly, and fervently to pray for the accompli&s;hment of this happy event. <Q>"For, who knoweth, if the Lord will return and re|pent, and leave a ble&s;&s;ing behind him?" <BIBL>Joel ii. 14.</BIBL></Q></P>
