<HEAD>EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OLD times, old fa&s;hions, and the Fairies gone;</L>
<L>Let us return, good folks, to &s;ixty-one&mdash;</L>
<L>To this ble&s;t time, ye Fair, of female glory,</L>
<L>When plea&s;ures unforbidden lie before ye!</L>
<L>No <HI>Sprites</HI> to fright you now, no guardian <HI>Elves;</HI></L>
<L>Your wi&s;e directors are&mdash;your own dear &s;elves&mdash;</L>
<L>And every Fair One feels, from old to young,</L>
<L>While the&s;e your guides&mdash;you never can do wrong.</L>
<L>Weak were the &s;ex of yore&mdash;their plea&s;ures few&mdash;</L>
<L>How much more wife, more &s;pirited are <HI>You?</HI></L>
<L>Would any Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> or Lady <HI>Mary,</HI></L>
<L>Ere they did <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that,</HI> con&s;ult a <HI>Fairy?</HI></L>
<L>Would they permit this &s;aucy pigmy crew,</L>
<L>For each &s;mall &s;lip, to pinch 'em black and blue?</L>
<L>Well may you &s;hudder&mdash;for, with all your charms,</L>
<L>Were this the ca&s;e&mdash;good heaven, what necks and arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus did they &s;erve our grandames heretofore&mdash;</L>
<L>The very thought mu&s;t make us moderns &s;ore!</L>
<L>Did their pour hearts for cards or dancing beat,</L>
<L>The&s;e <HI>Elves</HI> rais'd bli&s;ters on their hands and feet:</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Loo</HI> the game, and fiddles play'd mo&s;t &s;weetly&mdash;</L>
<L>They could not &s;queeze dear <HI>Pam,</HI> nor foot <HI>Moll Peatly.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="44">Were wives with hu&s;bands but a little wilful,</L>
<L>Were they at that &s;ame <HI>Loo</HI> a little <HI>&s;kilful;</HI></L>
<L>Did they with pretty fellows laugh or &s;port&mdash;</L>
<L>Wear ruffs too &s;mall, or petticoats too &s;hort:</L>
<L>Did they, no matter how, di&s;turb their cloaths;</L>
<L>Or, ever-lilied, add a little ro&s;e!&mdash;</L>
<L>The&s;e &s;piteful Fairies rattled round their beds,</L>
<L>And put &s;trange frightful non&s;en&s;e in their heads!</L>
<L>Nay, while the hu&s;band &s;nor'd and prudi&s;h aunt,</L>
<L>Had the fond wife but met the dear gallant&mdash;</L>
<L>Tho' lock'd the door, and all as &s;till as night&mdash;</L>
<L>Pop thro' the key-hole whips the Fairy Sprite,</L>
<L>Trips round the room&mdash;"My hu&s;band!" madam cries&mdash;</L>
<L>"The devil! where!" the frighted beau replies&mdash;</L>
<L>Jumps thro' the window&mdash;&s;he calls out in vain&mdash;</L>
<L>He, cur'd of love&mdash;and cool'd with drenching rain,</L>
<L>Swears&mdash;"Dem him if he'll e'er intrigue again!"</L>
<L>The&s;e were their tricks of old&mdash;But all allow,</L>
<L>No childi&s;h fears di&s;turb our Fair Ones now.&mdash;</L>

<L>Ladies, for all this trifling, 'twould be be&s;t</L>
<L>To keep a little <HI>Fairy</HI> in your brea&s;t:</L>
<L>Not one that &s;hould with moderate pa&s;&s;ions war;</L>
<L>But ju&s;t to tweak you&mdash;when you go too far.</L>
