<HEAD>A LETTER TO WILLIAM EDEN, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>December 6, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read your printed letter to Lord Carli&s;le, on the repre&s;entations of Ireland re&s;pecting a FREE TRADE;&mdash;I own, I at fir&s;t thought it rather ominous, when I &s;aw the name of a late commi&s;&s;ioner to Ame|rica prefixed to a work, the &s;ubject of which involves in it a que&s;tion concerning the RIGHTS OF A PEOPLE.&mdash;I find, however, I had little rea&s;on to be alarmed; for though you do not &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s, like <HI>my</HI> country|man Burke, all the patriot warmth that
<PB N="6" REF="3">
glows for general liberty, yet you do not appear, in the common acceptation of the word, an enemy to this kingdom:&mdash;there is &s;omething that looks at lea&s;t like candour in your &s;entiments; your &s;tyle is <HI>gentlemanly;</HI> and your meaning, where it is not envelo|ped in words, and ob&s;cured by explanation, may, I think, be comprehended. However, I am of opinion, that if you had under&s;tood a little the &s;ubject you had undertaken to di&s;cu&s;s, your pamphlet would have been more compleat. I &s;hall make no apology for this letter, for though your's is addre&s;&s;ed to your private friend, and public colleague in negotiation, yet, Sir, as it has been pub|li&s;hed, and I pre&s;ume with your approba|tion, it is now a candidate &s;ubject to prai&s;e or cen&s;ure from every individual who may, like you, have <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"lei&s;ure to advert to the printed accounts of <HI>&s;ome occurrences</HI> which have lately engaged the public attention:"</Q> For my own part I rejoice at the opportunity. While men of powerful abilities are exerting every effort in the defence of Ireland's na|tional
<PB N="7" REF="4">
rights, I am happy to find an object within my capacity on a matter of &s;o much importance; it has ever been my ambition, and where in my power, my endeavour to be of &s;ervice to my country; con&s;i&s;tent with my idea of that &s;ervice, I think it my duty to declare, without further egoti&s;m or introduction of my&s;elf to Mr. Eden, that the tenor of, and &s;entiments contained in his letter to the Earl of Carli&s;le, OUGHT TO BE REPROBATED IN IRELAND.</P>
<P>You confe&s;s in your exordium to your corre&s;pondent, that you are <HI>more de&s;titute of competent information,</HI> IF POSSIBLE, than he has <HI>hitherto</HI> found you; how his lord&s;hip may have hitherto found you I know not, and therefore &s;hall not infer that you were <HI>totally</HI> unfit for the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>new ta&s;k</HI>"</Q> which you had impo&s;ed upon your&s;elf; but, Sir, let this circum&s;tance be as it may, the want of competent information need not have di&s;|couraged you. If we may rea&s;on by analo|gy, according to the &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed by
<PB N="8" REF="5">
your patrons, the mini&s;try, incapacity is in no ca&s;e a di&s;qualification; the confe&s;&s;ion therefore of this want of <HI>competent information</HI> may not have been in you, Sir, any affecta|tion of mode&s;ty, it &s;erves only to anticipate an ob&s;ervation which every one mu&s;t cer|tainly make upon reading your performance. Neither, Sir, am I &s;urpri&s;ed at this your con|fe&s;&s;ed want of competent information with regard to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion; I have &s;aid, it relates to <Q REND="inline">"THE RIGHTS OF A PEOPLE,"</Q> a term which I apprehend has been long ba|ni&s;hed the circle in which you move, and con&s;equently cannot be there under&s;tood. I regret, Mr. Eden, that either from the blunder, or good intentions of governor John|&s;tone, you were deprived, on your emba&s;&s;y to America, of any conference with her &s;ena|tors; had you been &s;o happy to have had any communication of &s;entiments with them on the <Q REND="inline">"RIGHTS OF A PEOPLE,"</Q> you would have received &s;uch information that your competency on &s;uch a &s;ubject could ne|ver be que&s;tioned, and from the apparent in|tegrity
<PB N="9" REF="6">
of your intentions, all perver&s;ion of under&s;tanding removed; I am convinced you would have &s;acrificed to your information every grace and favor of a court; but, Sir, agreeable to your pre&s;ent mode of thinking, you have not once in your letter touched up|on THE RIGHT of the people of Ireland to a <HI>free trade.</HI> You &s;ay <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we &s;hould dive&s;t our|&s;elves of all prejudices contracted from the popular <HI>altercations</HI> of <HI>the day,</HI> that it is not the <HI>&s;trict</HI> policy of a former cen|tury, or the <HI>accidental</HI> di&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>pre&s;ent hour;</HI>"</Q> here we have both hour and day, as if our &s;ufferings, borne and growing in <Q REND="inline">"<HI>this unweeded garden,</HI>"</Q> &s;o long undi&s;|turbed, had their origin in the <HI>pre&s;ent hour,</HI> or at farthe&s;t a po&s;t or two before Mr. Eden thought proper to write his letter to lord Carli&s;le: it is impo&s;&s;ible, Sir, with temper to canvas the many terms, phra&s;es, and epithets in your pamphlet, &s;o trifling in them&s;elves and &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful to this in|jured country; there are a few of them, however, that it would be criminal to pa&s;s over without animadver&s;ion; do you
<PB N="10" REF="7">
mean by <Q REND="inline">"<HI>altercations of the day,</HI>"</Q> the una|nimous &s;en&s;e of the people of Ireland? Do you call the <HI>long</HI> and &s;hameful <HI>prohibition</HI> again&s;t the natural and ju&s;t rights of this kingdom <Q REND="inline">"an <HI>accidental</HI> di&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>pre&s;ent hour?</HI>"</Q> and do you &s;tile the per&s;evering, per|&s;ecuting in&s;olence of your countrymen, <Q REND="inline">"an <HI>imaginary</HI> neglect?"</Q> One phra&s;e you u&s;e indeed with &s;ome degree of ju&s;tice; our <HI>demands</HI> you define to be <Q REND="inline">"<HI>urgent eagerne&s;s;</HI>"</Q> be it &s;o. When I admit the truth, I am in|different to the tautology of the expre&s;&s;ion: the di&s;tre&s;s of Ireland you &s;ay <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>by whatever circum&s;tances occa&s;ioned, exi&s;ts and operates,</HI> Great-Britain cannot he&s;itate to give re|lief, the principal wing of <HI>her</HI> building is in danger."</Q> Still, Mr. Eden, you avoid <HI>the claim of right,</HI> and choo&s;e rather that barren re&s;ource, the BOUNTY of Great-Britain; but you a&s;&s;ert <Q REND="inline">"&s;he cannot he&s;itate to <HI>give</HI> relief."</Q> The ama&s;ing fortitude of Great Britain is be|yond comprehen&s;ion, &s;he is a very <HI>felo de &s;e</HI> in heroi&s;m. The impotent efforts of her cou|rage have almo&s;t wearied the arm of America; yet, <HI>Great Britain cannot he&s;itate to give relief;</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8">
alas, Sir, you are in this a&s;&s;ertion too full of the milk of human kindne&s;s. The feelings of your Great Britain are as ludicrous in the judgment of an Iri&s;hman, as the blu&s;h of Cae&s;ar in the opinion of Cato. You qua|lify indeed your <HI>generous</HI> a&s;&s;ertion, for you add this relief is to be <HI>given,</HI> becau&s;e it is for <Q REND="inline">"the &s;afety and &s;trength of the great <HI>center edifice,</HI>"</Q> and you de&s;cribe Ireland <Q REND="inline">"the principal <HI>wing</HI> of HER <HI>buildings.</HI>"</Q> I will al|low you, Sir, your figure in architecture, and if you plea&s;e all the ability of a Dutch engineer, you &s;hall dam up the ocean; but I know not where you will find that cement which can make Ireland, being a di&s;tinct kingdom, the <HI>wing,</HI> as you expre&s;s it, of Great Britain's <HI>buildings.</HI></P>
<P>I fear from the purport of your letter, you view this country as a province to your's; if &s;o, you are one of the wor&s;t mediators that could po&s;&s;ibly appear; however I can|not help wi&s;hing you more &s;ucce&s;s on this occa&s;ion, than the re&s;ult of your emba&s;&s;y to America can give us rea&s;on to expect.
<PB N="12" REF="9">
The idea of conque&s;t has been long &s;ince reprobated&mdash;the power of &s;upremacy has in fact, though not of right, remained.</P>
<P>When you &s;ay <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the di&s;tre&s;s of Ireland, <HI>by whatever circum&s;tances occa&s;ioned,</HI> exi&s;ts and operates,"</Q> I am inclined to think that ill as you are informed, you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the knowledge of &s;ome latent cau&s;es or cir|cum&s;tances occa&s;ioning this di&s;tre&s;s; it would have been candid to have declared them; but as you are &s;ilent, I &s;hall take it as admitted that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Ireland are oc|ca&s;ioned by the arbitrary re&s;trictions on her commercial rights, and that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nothing &s;hort of a FREE TRADE can give relief."</Q>&mdash;There is but one a&s;&s;ertion in this part of your letter which I can admit to be well|founded and indi&s;putable, namely, that our di&s;tre&s;s <Q REND="inline">"<HI>exi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>operates;</HI>"</Q> confident of its <HI>operation</HI> we can have no doubt of its <HI>exi&s;t|ence.</HI></P>
<P>You tell us, Sir, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a kind and manly <HI>confi|dence</HI> in the <HI>equity</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of Great
<PB N="13" REF="10">
Britain &s;hould regulate the <HI>expectations of Ireland.</HI>"</Q> You freely own <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the doubts and difficulties which the fir&s;t view of the &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts to your mind, are &s;uch as preclude all farther <HI>rea&s;onings</HI> without fur|ther <HI>information;</HI>"</Q> but in the &s;ame page you tell us that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when you &s;tate your <HI>rea&s;onings</HI> you will be <HI>better</HI> under&s;tood."</Q>&mdash;You &s;ay the que&s;tions to be a&s;ked are indeed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nu|merous, <HI>nice</HI> and intricate, and that the whole &s;y&s;tem of revenue is involved in the propo&s;ition."</Q> You recommend <HI>candid recollection,</HI> fair and diligent <HI>enquiry, caution, minute inve&s;tigation, much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and ma|ture deliberation:</HI> Now why and wherefore all the&s;e trappings of language? why is re|collection, which is in its nature involun|tary, to be governed by candour? and why &s;hall diligence enquire, caution inve&s;tigate, and deliberation di&s;cu&s;s?&mdash;I will an&s;wer&mdash;Ire|land demands what England has no right to refu&s;e; unwilling to comply &s;he would take every chance from time, hitherto by no means amicable to her intere&s;t; many events may
<PB N="14" REF="11">
happen before recollection can be perfectly candid, before caution can thoroughly in|ve&s;tigate the whole minutiae of commerce, and before <HI>mature deliberation</HI> can di&s;cu&s;s the <HI>involved &s;y&s;tem of the revenue.</HI> Peace may be, no matter on what conce&s;&s;ions or conditions, purcha&s;ed or obtained from Spain and France; Britain, <HI>now</HI> exhau&s;ted, will be &s;uf|ficiently powerful, and then adieu to <HI>fair enquiry</HI> and <HI>candid recollection;</HI> farewel to all the fond hopes and hone&s;t expectations of poor deluded Ireland: her only a&s;ylum will be, in &s;uch ca&s;e, THE WISDOM AND EQUITY of Great Britain. After deli|beration, &amp;c. you proceed with an army of doubts, bringing up many a <HI>perhaps</HI> and <HI>pro|bably</HI> in their rear; and among a variety of novel remarks, as certain as your di&s;covery that where di&s;tre&s;s exi&s;ts it operates, you tell us that <Q REND="inline">"political operations mu&s;t often be influenced by circum&s;tances; and that unad|vi&s;ed mea&s;ures ought not to be adopted"</Q>&mdash;it is true,&mdash;your &s;tile of rea&s;oning, where certainty appears to demon&s;tration, cannot
<PB N="15" REF="12">
be di&s;puted; like an arithmetical rule it cannot err; &s;omething &s;imilar is the advice of Friar Laurence, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wi&s;ely and <HI>&s;low;</HI> they &s;tumble who run fa&s;t;"</Q> and this, Mr. Eden, I have, after <HI>mature deliberation, diligent en|quiry, and minute inve&s;tigation,</HI> di&s;covered to be the grand object of your pamphlet. I will not &s;ay you wi&s;h to confu&s;e one of the mo&s;t &s;imple and lea&s;t complicated que&s;tions ever agitated; but this I am at liberty to believe, that if your pamphlet is read with approbation, it will have that effect: I will not a&s;&s;ert that your intention is for &s;ome malicious purpo&s;e, to cau&s;e <HI>delay</HI> in this country; but this I have a right to declare, that if your rea&s;oning be adopted it will produce <HI>delay&mdash;</HI>the adage is in my favour&mdash;I think it dangerous. When, Sir, a people are convinced that their rights are withheld, they cannot, if capable, be too &s;udden in their re&s;olves; and give me leave to remind you, that Ireland is <HI>now</HI> in this &s;ituation, that her &s;ucce&s;s depends on expedition; de|liberation, di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and inve&s;tigation, may
<PB N="16" REF="13">
be the political motto of your country; I tru&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>carpe diem!</HI>"</Q> will be that of mine; but meet our wi&s;hes, and you will find this maxim verified by a nation&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the brave are always generous."</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;idering, Sir, how ill-informed you were of your road, you have ventured to travel a con&s;iderable way, though you do not appear to have gained much ground. I &s;hall not attempt to follow you, for you &s;eem to me to be as little acquainted with the place you would go to, as of the road you are to travel; you have been taking the air in a labyrinth of your own creating, and after having tripped over many a path which led to nothing, you at length find your&s;elf at the point from whence you &s;et out.</P>
<P>However, Sir, as your intentions &s;eem to be good, though the effect of your opinion being pur&s;ued might be otherwi&s;e, I have, in reading your performance, endeavoured to re&s;cue the text from all the prittine&s;&s;es of
<PB N="17" REF="14">
point and antithe&s;is, and to free it from a number of barren premi&s;es and incon&s;equent conclu&s;ions; the re&s;ult is, you think, Ireland is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and ought to be relieved. But to pronounce upon the cau&s;e of that di|&s;tre&s;s, or to point out the mode of relief, requires in your idea &s;o <HI>much precaution,</HI> &s;uch <HI>diligent enquiry,</HI> &s;uch <HI>candid recollection,</HI> &s;uch <HI>minute inve&s;tigation,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>mature deliberation,</HI> that, you doubt, you he&s;itate, your letter &s;eems the chance medley of your pen, and in the end you give no opinion at all about the matter. To &s;atisfy the&s;e doubts, Sir, as well as to give you, as far as my endea|vours will permit, a little of that informati|on you &s;eem &s;o de&s;irous of obtaining, I flatter my&s;elf you will be obliged to me, &s;hould I comment upon &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in your pamphlet as I have already taken notice of, or &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to quote.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="15">
In the fir&s;t in&s;tance you tell us <HI>a kind and manly confidence in the</HI> EQUITY AND WISDOM of Great Britain &s;hould regulate our expec|tations;&mdash;if, Sir, the equity and wi&s;dom of the <HI>people</HI> of Great Britain could afford us any relief, confidence in them might indeed be well placed; but the peo|ple of Great Britain have long &s;ince forgot to take the management of their <HI>own</HI> affairs into their <HI>own</HI> hands, and I dare &s;ay you are one of tho&s;e who would be very &s;orry if they were to renew the practice. I am con|vinced therefore you did not mean the wi&s;|dom and equity of the Briti&s;h <HI>people.&mdash;</HI>Is it upon tho&s;e qualities in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try that you wi&s;h us to rely?&mdash;Now, Sir, much as we re&s;pect them, for we, as well as the Americans, are certainly under great obli|gations to them, yet I think we &s;hall &s;carce|ly agree with them in our ideas of <HI>wi&s;dom and equity.</HI></P>
<P>As to WISDOM, WE think a part of it con|&s;i&s;ts in <HI>profiting by experience,&mdash;</HI>in this we
<PB N="19" REF="16">
differ widely from the mini&s;try, and it is becau&s;e we think it wi&s;e to profit by expe|rience, that we do not choo&s;e to place any confidence in <HI>mini&s;terial</HI> wi&s;dom. As to EQUITY&mdash;I believe it will be found that our notions on this head differ &s;till more wide|ly from their's. We in this country annex certain ideas of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice to the term <HI>equity&mdash;</HI>I do not &s;ay we are right in do|ing &s;o, I would not di&s;pute the authority of mini&s;ters, I only &s;ay the fact is &s;o. Now I have endeavoured to find out the mini&s;te|rial meaning of the word <HI>equity,</HI> and have for this purpo&s;e con&s;ulted the Briti&s;h &s;ta|tutes by way of dictionary. I there find that equity means a <HI>monopoly</HI> of trade and of liberty; it means authority without ju&s;tice, and power without right; it is to treat fel|low &s;ubjects, whom local circum&s;tances &s;e|parate from you, and inferiority of num|bers place in your power, as the &s;ubjects of &s;ubjects, or rather as unarmed natural ene|mies. It is bountiful to &s;uffer us to ex|i&s;t,
<PB N="20" REF="17" MS="y">
and humanely to deprive us of the means of exi&s;tence; it is to force us to purcha&s;e commodities, and to prohibit our earning the purcha&s;e money&mdash;it is to expect a re|venue from the poverty mini&s;ters would entail, which could be yielded only by the affluence they would prevent&mdash;it is, in &s;hort, to &s;ay, that as far as your power can reach, liberty, independence, dignity, wealth and commerce &s;hall belong to you exclu&s;ively:&mdash;dependence, poverty and re&s;trictive laws &s;hall be the portion of all who are connected with you. The&s;e, Sir, as far as I could col|lect from the dictionary I con&s;ulted, have been the various <HI>mini&s;terial</HI> meanings of the word <HI>equity</HI> for two centuries back&mdash;perhaps it is very well explained there; but this is not exactly the &s;ort of equity in which we can place much confidence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not object to the next pa&s;&s;age I have taken notice of, in which you proceed or attempt to &s;tate your rea&s;onings, imme|diately after having acknowledged that
<PB N="21" REF="18">
without fuller information you are preclud|ed from all farther rea&s;oning upon the &s;ub|ject:&mdash;you might &s;ay that this would be carping at a term, that I &s;hould con&s;ider what the <HI>fact</HI> was, and that no one who was not determined to cavil, could po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;take what followed<HI>&mdash;for rea&s;oning.&mdash;</HI>I admit the <HI>force</HI> of the ob&s;ervation, and &s;hall proceed in my review of &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>You &s;ay the que&s;tions to be a&s;ked relative to the granting of a free trade to Ireland are indeed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"numerous, nice and intricate; theoretical deductions will not a&s;&s;i&s;t us; trading e&s;tabli&s;hments, regulations of com|merce, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of revenue are involved in the propo&s;ition:"</Q> You expre&s;s your fears at <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"rever&s;ing the &s;y&s;tem pur&s;ued by <HI>wi&s;e</HI> &s;tate&s;men during two centuries"</Q> You dread <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the giving a &s;udden &s;hock or precipitate revul&s;ion to the cour&s;e of Briti&s;h trade, com|merce and revenue:"</Q> And after having made &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions in our fa|vour,

<P>What, Sir, is it you mean by <HI>a &s;udden outery,</HI> that may be <HI>fallacious or ill-founded?</HI> Do you call, Sir, the unanimous addre&s;&s;es of both hou&s;es of parliament <HI>a &s;udden outery?</HI> Do you call the unanimous voice of the whole peo|ple of Ireland <HI>a &s;udden outery</HI> that may be <HI>fallacious or ill-founded?&mdash;</HI>Read your &s;tatutes, Sir, which with a clerk-like care you have collected, and &s;eem to have made &s;o little

<P>I a&s;k pardon, Sir, for the warmth into which you have betrayed me;&mdash;perhaps you were not aware of the force of what you &s;aid;&mdash;and as you have in mo&s;t places u&s;ed a multiplicity of words without &s;aying any thing,&mdash;you have here, without knowing it, &s;aid a great deal in a few. It mu&s;t be owned you for the mo&s;t part &s;helter your&s;elf under a number of laboured ex|pre&s;&s;ions, de&s;igned for ornament, and de&s;ti|tute of meaning;&mdash;you would hide the deficiency of your matter in the tin&s;el of your &s;tile;&mdash;like a &s;hining bubble, gaudy, light and empty, you float upon the &s;urface of a &s;ubject, to enter deeply into which &s;eems to require talents more weighty than your's.

You have indeed endeavoured to render the que&s;tions relative to the granting A FREE TRADE to Ireland, numerous, nice and in|tricate&mdash;you boldly a&s;&s;ert that the propo&s;i|tion involves in it the whole &s;y&s;tem of the Briti&s;h revenue.&mdash;I think, Sir, as you di&s;|claim <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all ha&s;ty inferences and <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> a&s;&s;er|tions,"</Q> you might at lea&s;t have made an at|tempt at proving one of &s;o much importance as the pre&s;ent. But, Sir, your &s;ub&s;equent arguments, if they tend to any thing, tend to prove that the Briti&s;h revenue has little or nothing to do with the que&s;tion; and I will undertake to &s;hew that your fears of rever&s;ing the &s;y&s;tem pur&s;ued by wi&s;e &s;tate&s;|men during two centuries, and of giving a &s;udden &s;hock or precipitate revul&s;ion to the cour&s;e of Briti&s;h trade, are equally ground|le&s;s.

<P>A FREE TRADE, Sir, the meaning of which you have affected not to comprehend, is &s;uch a trade as FREEMEN ought of right to po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;it is a trade &s;ubject to no re|&s;trictions in the country to which it belongs, but &s;uch, as the inhabitants of that coun|try, being freemen, have through their repre|&s;entatives, con&s;ented &s;hould take place&mdash;What, Sir, is the meaning of the term FREE COUNTRY?&mdash;Your vi&s;it to AMERICA may po&s;&s;ibly have helped you to comprehend, however unknown to you before:&mdash;Is it not, Sir, a country &s;ubject to no laws but tho&s;e to which the inhabitants &s;hall have directly or virtually given their a&s;&s;ent? ought not this to have led you to what was meant by a FREE TRADE. Folly
<PB N="26" REF="23">
it&s;elf could never have conceived it to imply, a trade &s;ubject to no re&s;trictions, any more than that a free country &s;hould be a country &s;ubject to no law; when then you call it <Q REND="inline">"an undefined expre&s;&s;ion"</Q> you talk ignorantly&mdash;it is an expre&s;&s;ion as de|finite and determinate as in the nature of language can exist.&mdash;Now, Sir, let us exa|mine what effect the leaving the regula|tion of the Iri&s;h trade to the WISDOM AND EQUITY of the IRISH legi&s;lature would have upon the revenue and commerce of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition, as far as it relates to Great Britain, can be con&s;idered only in two points of view; fir&s;t, how far it can effect the Briti&s;h commerce and revenue, with regard to the trade immediately car|ried on between Great Britain and Ireland; &s;econdly, how far it may interfere with the trade of Great Britain to <HI>foreign</HI> parts.&mdash;I &s;hall here, Sir, remark once for all, that
<PB N="27" REF="24">
the pre&s;ent propo&s;ition has no relation whatever to the trade of Great Britain with any of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements or co|lonies in A&s;ia, Africa or America (I include America only for argument &s;ake)&mdash;If Great Britain admits Ireland to a participa|tion of her trade to &s;uch &s;ettlements or colonies, the Iri&s;h will con&s;ider it as a favour to which of <HI>right</HI> they have no claim, for which they will not only be grateful, but will be ready to make every equitable compen&s;ation in their power; <HI>this,</HI> however, mu&s;t be a matter of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t re&s;t upon the mutual agreements of the parliaments of both kingdoms, and <HI>this</HI> may probably be a matter of <HI>mature deliber|ation.</HI></P>
<P>With regard then to the fir&s;t que&s;tion before us, the effect a free trade to Ireland will have upon the Briti&s;h revenue imme|diately re&s;ulting from the Briti&s;h trade to Ireland; I conceive, as the produce of
<PB N="28" REF="25">
the Briti&s;h colonies and &s;ettlements is left totally out of the que&s;tion, there is but one inconvenience to Great Britain which can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e.</P>
<P>You have remarked, Sir, that though Ireland has at all times had full liberty to <HI>manufacture goods for her own con&s;umption;</HI> wonderful favour! generous indulgence! Was there no <HI>mature deliberation,</HI> no <HI>minute inve&s;tigation,</HI> in Briti&s;h councils, that <HI>this</HI> liberty has &s;o long exi&s;ted?</P>
<P>But though Ireland, you &s;ay, has had this liberty, the con&s;umers have hitherto found it ea&s;ier to purcha&s;e from England many articles both of luxury and conveni|ence than to make them at home;&mdash;the effect then of a free exportation of Iri&s;h manufactures to foreign countries would, probably, be a con&s;iderable improvement in their quality and workman&s;hip, &s;o that the Iri&s;h con&s;umer would no longer be
<PB N="29" REF="26">
induced to purcha&s;e &s;imilar manufactures from England&mdash;the value of the exports of which to Ireland would be in that ca&s;e a net lo&s;s to Great Britain&mdash;agreed.&mdash;I will admit this to be one of the con&s;e|quences of freedom of trade to Ireland&mdash;I will not advantage my&s;elf by a&s;&s;ertion and &s;ay there is no ju&s;tice in the ob&s;erva|tion, and that it &s;hould not hold&mdash;I will allow it to go much further in theory than I am convinced it will in practice&mdash;what then?&mdash;is it only a <HI>free trade</HI> that can be productive of &s;uch con&s;equences, and are the&s;e nece&s;&s;arily <HI>prevented</HI> by de|priving us of it?&mdash;do they not already exi&s;t to their utmo&s;t extent, although we have no free trade? have not our <HI>non-impor|tation</HI> agreements already produced in this re&s;pect the very effects which you might apprehend from granting Ireland a free trade?&mdash;it is, therefore, fair to conclude, that as far as relates to the commerce imme|diately carried on between the two king|doms,
<PB N="30" REF="27">
<HI>no additional lo&s;s or inconvenience could re&s;ult to Great Britain from the grant.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir, as the&s;e <HI>non-importation</HI> agree|ments were founded in nece&s;&s;ity, not choice; as they were entered into in order to give employment to thou&s;ands of &s;tarv|ing manufacturers, the probability is, that as &s;oon as we can find &s;ufficient &s;ale in foreign markets for our manufactures, to keep our <HI>manufacturers</HI> fully employed, we &s;hall again re&s;ort to England for &s;uch commodities, as from the infant &s;tate of many of our manufactures, it will require much time before they can be brought to any equal degree of perfection in this coun|try; &s;o that, far from being detrimental to Great Britain, it is by means <HI>only</HI> of allow|ing a free trade to Ireland, that Great Britain can ever hope to recover the ad|vantages &s;he formerly derived from her commerce with this kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="28">
With regard to the &s;econd que&s;tion, how far freedom of trade to Ireland may inter|fere with the trade of Great Britain to <HI>fo|reign</HI> parts, I &s;hall only quote on the oc|ca&s;ion a few pa&s;&s;ages from your pamphlet, which, from a comparative view with the re&s;t of your letter, I &s;hould think had been quo|tations made by you:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is now well under&s;tood that the flouri&s;hing of neigh|bouring nations in their trade is to our advantage; and that if we could extin|gui&s;h their indu&s;try and manufactures, our own would langui&s;h;&mdash;if we are capable of looking beyond the extent of a &s;ingle, &s;hopboard, <HI>we cannot con&s;ider the Iri&s;h as rivals in intere&s;t,</HI> even though they &s;hould become <HI>our a&s;&s;ociates in lucrative pur&s;uits.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir Matthew Decker (who wrote upon &s;ome points with &s;ingular ability) was clearly of opinion that the re&s;traints on the Iri&s;h woollen contributed in their ef|fects to dimini&s;h the foreign trade of
<PB N="32" REF="29">
Great Britain,"</Q> and finally, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it &s;eems de|mon&s;trable, that the export of native manufactured commodities from any one part of the king's dominions, mu&s;t be ad|vantageous to the whole, wherever the burdens and duties are &s;o regulated as to leave no exclu&s;ive advantage; for that again would operate as a monopoly."</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, what is become of that chain of difficulties with which you endeavoured to inclo&s;e the que&s;tion? How is the whole &s;y&s;|tem of the Briti&s;h revenue involved in it?&mdash;Where is the nece&s;&s;ity for all that delay, caution, deliberation, and mature di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon which you de&s;cant &s;o much?</P>
<P>I think, Sir, it is evident that this que&s;tion, which according to you, is of a nature &s;o very intricate and difficult, may be reduced to a very narrow compa&s;s.&mdash;The demand of Ireland for a free trade, means nothing more than that all commercial regulations
<PB N="33" REF="30">
<HI>in Ireland</HI> &s;hould be left to the wi&s;dom and equity of the Iri&s;h legi&s;lature:&mdash;This would effect England only in two ways; fir&s;t, it might her exports to Ireland. Secondly, it might interfere with her trade with fo|reign powers. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I have &s;hewn that our NON-IMPORTATION agreements, in their operations, are already productive of the &s;ame effects to a great|er extent.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd, you have your&s;elf furni&s;hed very good arguments to prove that the apprehen&s;ions of England on that account are groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>With regard to any participation of trade, that Great Britain may think pro|per to allow to Ireland, I have already &s;aid, that this forms no part of the de|mand of Ireland for a free trade, but is a point which mu&s;t be referred to future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; probably the be&s;t means of &s;et|tling
<PB N="34" REF="31">
it, would be to appoint deputations from the parliaments of both kingdoms, who &s;hould determine upon the conce&s;&s;i|ons to be made by <HI>both,</HI> and upon the commercial regulations to be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the common benefit of the whole em|pire.</P>
<P>I have hitherto, in &s;peaking of the &s;ub|ject of the Iri&s;h free trade, u&s;ed <HI>your</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ions, that it &s;hould be <HI>allowed, given,</HI> or <HI>granted</HI> by Great Britain.&mdash;I have done this merely to comply with the u&s;ual &s;tile of &s;peech upon the occa&s;ion; but had you conde&s;cended to vi&s;it this country, before you ventured to write upon it, you would have &s;een, from the pre&s;ent &s;ituation and &s;pirit of the peo|ple, that, to talk of an Engli&s;h parlia|ment <HI>allowing</HI> a kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a complete legi&s;lature within her&s;elf, the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of her <HI>own</HI> ports&mdash;to talk of the re|pre&s;entatives of the freeholders of Eng|land,
<PB N="35" REF="32">
<HI>giving leave</HI> to the people of Ire|land, who acknwledge no &s;uch authority, to export their own manufactures, or to import &s;uch merchandize as they &s;hall think proper to import&mdash;I &s;ay, Sir, that had you conde&s;cended to vi&s;it this country, you would have perceived, that to talk thus is to talk <HI>idly.</HI></P>
<P>A free trade, &s;uch as I have defined it to be, the people of Ireland do not a&s;k of Great Britain as a <HI>favour,</HI> they demand it as a <HI>right&mdash;</HI>they conceive that no power upon earth, excepting their own legi&s;lature, con&s;i&s;ting of the king, lords and commons of Ireland, po&s;&s;e&s;s a right to &s;hut up their ports.&mdash;When they demand a free trade, they do not addre&s;s the Engli&s;h parliament in their legi&s;la|tive capacity to repeal re&s;trictive laws;&mdash;they addre&s;s you as a neighbouring na|tion, to di&s;avow <HI>an odious u&s;urpation,</HI> equal|ly impolitic and unju&s;t, to di&s;claim not
<PB N="36" REF="33">
laws but arbitrary illegal determinations, which nothing but your being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fleet, and our want of one, could have in&s;pired you with the inju&s;tice to maintain.</P>
<P>We would reque&s;t our &s;overeign, the king of Ireland, that he would not &s;uffer certain ve&s;&s;els belonging to his Britannic maje&s;ty, (commonly called revenue cut|ters) to board, in a piratical manner, the &s;hips belonging to Iri&s;h &s;ubjects; for, when &s;uch cutters, under pretence of &s;earching for goods, the exportation of which from Ireland is prohibited only by the arbitrary re&s;olves of the Briti&s;h parliament, and not by any <HI>Iri&s;h law,</HI> &s;uch ve&s;&s;els act <HI>without law,</HI> and are therefore pirates.</P>
<P>This doctrine may appear new to you, Sir, but it would be prudent in your patrons to recollect, that it is a doctrine,
<PB N="37" REF="34">
adopted by three millions of people.&mdash;When you &s;peak then, of Ireland's be|ing <Q REND="inline">"a jewel in the Briti&s;h crown,"</Q> you &s;eem to forget that Ireland has a diadem of her own&mdash;plundered in|deed it may have been by the u&s;urped power of a foreign legi&s;lature; but, &s;tripped and unadorned as it is, it can &s;till confer power and dignity on the wearer.&mdash;The HONOUR, Sir, of this diadem, is now guarded by FIFTY THOUSAND ARMED FREEMEN.</P>
