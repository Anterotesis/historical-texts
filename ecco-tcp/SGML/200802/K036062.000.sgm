<L>Before who&s;e altar virtue oft' hath bled,</L>
<L N="190">And oft' a fated victim &s;hall be led:</L>
<L>Lo! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It were to be wi&s;hed that Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with greater preci&s;ion on this &s;ubject: However, thus much may be affirmed with truth.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, By the general tenour of his E&s;&s;ays on <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and the <HI>Freedom of Wit and Humour,</HI> it appears that his principal de&s;ign was to recommend the <HI>Way of Ridicule</HI> (as he calls it) for the <HI>Inve&s;tigation</HI> of Truth, and <HI>Detection</HI> of Fal&s;hood, not only in <HI>moral</HI> but <HI>religious</HI> &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, It appears no le&s;s evident, that in the cour&s;e of his rea&s;onings on this que&s;tion, he confounds two things which are in their nature and con&s;equences entirely different. The&s;e are, <HI>Ridicule</HI> and <HI>Good-Humour:</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> acknowledged by all to be the be&s;t <HI>Mediator</HI> in every debate; the <HI>former</HI> no le&s;s regarded by mo&s;t, as an <HI>Embroiler</HI> and <HI>Incendiary.</HI> Tho' he &s;ets out with a formal profe&s;&s;ion of proving the efficacy of Wit, Humour, and Ridicule in the inve&s;tigation of Truth, yet by &s;hifting and mixing his terms, he generally &s;lides in&s;en&s;ibly into mere encomiums on Good-Breeding, Chearful|ne&s;s, Urbanity, and free Enquiry. This indeed keeps &s;omething like an argument on foot, and amu&s;es the &s;uperficial reader; but to a more ob&s;ervant eye di&s;covers a very contemptible defect either of &s;incerity or penetration.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion concerning Ridicule may be thus not improperly &s;tated: Whether <HI>doubt|ful</HI> Propo&s;itions of any kind can be <HI>a&s;certained</HI> by the application of <HI>Ridicule?</HI> Much might be &s;aid on this que&s;tion; but a few words will make the matter clear to an un|prejudiced mind.</P>
<P>The Di&s;approbation or Contempt which certain objects rai&s;e in the mind of man, is a particular mode of Pa&s;&s;ion: the objects of this pa&s;&s;ion are <HI>apparent</HI> Fal&s;hood, Incon|gruity, or Impropriety of &s;ome particular kinds. Thus, the object of Fear is <HI>apparent</HI> Danger, or probable approaching Ill. But who has ever dreamt of exalting the pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Fear</HI> into a <HI>Standard</HI> or <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of <HI>real Danger?</HI> The de&s;ign mu&s;t have been rejected as ab&s;urd, becau&s;e it is the work of Rea&s;on <HI>only,</HI> to correct and fix the pa&s;&s;ion on its proper objects. The ca&s;e is parallel: <HI>apparent</HI> or <HI>&s;eeming</HI> Fal&s;hoods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the objects of Contempt; but it is the work of Rea&s;on <HI>only,</HI> to determine whether the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> Fal&s;|hoods be <HI>real</HI> or <HI>fictitious.</HI> But it is &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Sen&s;e of Ridicule</HI> can never be mi&s;|taken."</Q>&mdash;Why, no more can the <HI>Sen&s;e of Danger.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What, do men never <HI>fear</HI> without rea&s;on?"</Q>&mdash;Yes, very commonly; but they as often <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> and <HI>laugh</HI> without rea&s;on. And thus, before any thing can be determined in either ca&s;e, Rea&s;on, and Rea|&s;on only, mu&s;t examine Circum&s;tances, &s;eparate Ideas, decide upon, re&s;train, and cor|rect the Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the <HI>way of Ridicule</HI> is in fact no more than a <HI>&s;pecies of Elo|quence:</HI> It applies to a Pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore can go no farther in the inve&s;tigation of Truth, than any of tho&s;e arts which tend to rai&s;e Love, Pity, Terror, Rage or Hatred in the heart of man. Con&s;equently, his Lord&s;hip might have tran&s;planted the <HI>whole Sy&s;tem of Rhetorick</HI> into his new &s;cheme, with the &s;ame propriety as he hath introduced the <HI>way of Ridicule</HI> it&s;elf. A hopeful project this, for the propagation of Truth!</P>
<P>As this &s;eems to be the real nature and tendency of Ridicule, it hath been generally di&s;couraged by <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> and <HI>Divines,</HI> together with every other mode of eloquence, when apply'd to <HI>controverted Opinions.</HI> This di&s;couragement, from what is &s;aid above, appears to have been rational and ju&s;t; therefore the charge laid again&s;t <HI>Divines</HI> with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> (See a note on the <HI>Plea&s;ures of Imagination,</HI> Book III.) &s;eems entirely groundle&s;s. The di&s;tinction which the &s;ame author hath attempted with re&s;pect to the influence of Ridicule, between <HI>&s;peculative</HI> and <HI>moral Truths,</HI> &s;eems no better founded. It is certain that <HI>Opinions</HI> are no le&s;s liable to Ridicule than <HI>Actions.</HI> And it is no le&s;s certain that the way of Ridicule cannot <HI>deter|mine</HI> the Propriety or Impropriety of the <HI>one,</HI> more than the Truth or Fal&s;hood of the <HI>other</HI>; becau&s;e the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion of Contempt is equally engaged in both ca&s;es, and there|fore (as above) Rea&s;on <HI>only</HI> can examine the circum&s;tances of the <HI>Action</HI> or <HI>Opinion,</HI> and thus &s;ix the Pa&s;&s;ion on its <HI>proper</HI> Objects.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this new de&s;ign of <HI>di&s;covering Truth</HI> by the <HI>vague</HI> and <HI>un&s;teady Light of Ridicule,</HI> puts one in mind of the hone&s;t <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> who apply'd his <HI>Candle</HI> to the <HI>Sun-Dial</HI> in order to &s;ee how the Night went.</P></NOTE>Shaftsb'ry rears her high on rea&s;on's throne,</L>
