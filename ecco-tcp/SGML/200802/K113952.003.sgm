<P>Cupid opens his de&s;ign of making the Kite, and offers his arms to Dian. The Loves de&s;cend. The plan for the Kite is laid out by a mechanical Love, who begs Cupid's bow of Dian.

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>One of the Loves is &s;ent to Aeolus, for a pro&s;perous gale to fly the Kite. Aeolus's cell de&s;cribed. The Love returns with the gale to Dian. Cupid gives directions for the flight. Juno's envy, who &s;ends Iris to cut the &s;tring. The Kite is turned into a &s;tar.</P>

<L>BUT Cupid now, with anxious thoughts oppre&s;s'd,</L>

<L>" Or Jove deny, when Love and Dian plead?"</L>

<L>His mother Wales, and fill thy Edward's place,</L>
<L>How would that genius, who&s;e propitious wings</L>
<L>Have here twice hover'd o'er the &s;ons of kings,</L>
<L>De&s;cend triumphant to his antient &s;eat,</L>
<L>And take in charge a third Plantagenet!</L>

<HEAD>COLIN AND LUCY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ON the banks of that cry&s;talline &s;tream,</L>
<L>Where Thames oft his current delays!</L>
<L>And charms, more than poets can dream,</L>
<L>In his Richmond's bright villa &s;urveys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Lucy, of all the gay throng,</L>
<L>The faire&s;t that Britain has &s;een!</L>
<L>Now drew every village along,</L>
<L>From the day &s;he fir&s;t danc'd on the green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! boa&s;t not of beauty's fond power,</L>
<L>For &s;hort is the triumph, ye fair!</L>
<L>Not fleeter the bloom of each flower;</L>
<L>And hope is but gilded de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His de&s;ire each &s;wain now behold,</L>
<L>By riches endeavours to prove!</L>
<L>But Lucy, &s;till cries, what is gold,</L>
<L>Or wealth, when compar'd to his love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="120" REF="122">
<L>No, Colin! together we'll wield</L>
<L>Our &s;ickles in &s;ummer's bright day;</L>
<L>Together we'll leaze o'er the field;</L>
<L>And &s;mile all our labours away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In winter I'll winnow the wheat</L>
<L>As it falls, from your flail, on the ground:</L>
<L>That flail will be mu&s;ic, as &s;weet</L>
<L>When your voice in the labour is drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How oft would he &s;peak of his bli&s;s?</L>
<L>How oft would he call her his maid?</L>
<L>And Colin would &s;eal, with a ki&s;s,</L>
<L>Every promi&s;e and vow which he laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But hark! o'er the gra&s;s-level land,</L>
<L>The village bells &s;ound on the plain!</L>
<L>Fal&s;e Colin this morn gave his hand;</L>
<L>And Lucy's fond tears are in vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad Lucy too &s;oon heard the tale;</L>
<L>Too &s;oon the &s;ad cau&s;e &s;he was told:</L>
<L>That his was a nymph of the vale,</L>
<L>That he broke his fond promi&s;e for gold!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As &s;he walkt by the margin &s;o green,</L>
<L>That adorns Thames' flowery &s;ide;</L>
<L>How oft was &s;he langui&s;hing &s;een?</L>
<L>How oft would &s;he gaze on the tide?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="121" REF="123">
<L>By the clear mirror then as &s;he &s;ate,</L>
<L>That reflected her&s;elf and the mead;</L>
<L>A-while &s;he bewail'd her &s;ad fate!</L>
<L>And the green turf &s;till pillow'd her head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There! there! is it Lucy I &s;ee?&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tis Lucy the lo&s;t undone maid!</L>
<L>Ah! no, 'tis &s;ome Lucy like me,</L>
<L>Some haple&s;s young virgin betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like me, &s;he has &s;orrow'd and wept;</L>
<L>Like me, &s;he has fondly believ'd;</L>
<L>Like me, her true promi&s;e &s;he kept,</L>
<L>And like me too is ju&s;tly deceiv'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I come, dear companion in grief!</L>
<L>Gay &s;cenes and fond plea&s;ures adieu!</L>
<L>I come, and we'll gather relief;</L>
<L>From bo&s;oms &s;o cha&s;te and &s;o true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like you! I have mourn'd the long night;</L>
<L>And wept out the day in de&s;pair!</L>
<L>Like you! I have bani&s;h'd delight;</L>
<L>And bo&s;om'd a friend in my care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye meadows, &s;o lovely, farewell!</L>
<L>Your velvet &s;till Colin &s;hall tread,</L>
<L>All deaf to the &s;ound of that knell,</L>
<L>Which tolls for his Lucy when dead!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="122" REF="124">
<L>Your wi&s;h will too &s;ure be obey'd!</L>
<L>Nor Colin her lo&s;s &s;hall bemoan:</L>
<L>Soon, &s;oon &s;hall poor Lucy be laid,</L>
<L>Where her heart &s;hall be cold as your own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, cla&s;p'd in the arms of that fair,</L>
<L>Who&s;e wealth has been Lucy's &s;ad fate!</L>
<L>As together you breathe the free air,</L>
<L>And a thou&s;and dear plea&s;ures relate:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If chance, o'er my turf as you tread,</L>
<L>You dare to affect a fond &s;igh!</L>
<L>The primro&s;e will &s;hrink its pale head;</L>
<L>And the violet langui&s;h and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce echo had gather'd the &s;ound,</L>
<L>But &s;he plung'd from her gra&s;s-&s;pringing bed;</L>
<L>The liquid &s;tream parts to the ground;</L>
<L>And the mirror clos'd over her head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;wains of the village at eve</L>
<L>Oft meet at the dark-&s;preading yew;</L>
<L>There, wonder how man could deceive</L>
<L>A bo&s;om &s;o cha&s;te and &s;o true!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With garlands of every flower,</L>
<L>Which Lucy her&s;elf &s;hould have made,</L>
<L>They rai&s;e up a &s;hort-living bower,</L>
<L>And, &s;ighing! cry, peace to her &s;hade!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="123" REF="125">
<L>Then, hand lock'd in hand, as they move</L>
<L>The green-platting hilloc around;</L>
<L>They talk of &s;ad Lucy, and love!</L>
<L>And fre&s;hen with tears the fair ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay! wi&s;h they had never been born,</L>
<L>Or liv'd the &s;ad moment to view!</L>
<L>When a Colin could thus be for&s;worn;</L>
<L>And a Lucy could &s;till be &s;o true!</L>
