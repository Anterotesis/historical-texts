<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Happine&s;s of Mankind depends vi&s;ibly on their living in Society, and of Cour&s;e under Subjection to Laws; of which, the &s;horte&s;t and the cleare&s;t Proof is this, that Men are alike mi&s;erable, under the two extremes of Tyranny and Anarchy; both of which are Privations of Law, and con&s;equently of Government. The Operation of Laws, with re&s;pect to the Wel|fare of Society, depends upon their Execution, and this infers the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Magi&s;trates, who, in all Monarchies, derive their Autho|rity from the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate; whence the King is, with equal Truth and Propriety, &s;aid to be the Fountain of Ju&s;tice as well as of Honour. The Nature of Offices has been always declared to the People by exterior Signs, and hence the Cu&s;tom of inve&s;ting Superior, and more e&s;pecially the Supreme Magi&s;trate, with extra|ordinary Solemnity, at his Entrance upon Government, which, tho' with very different Forms, has yet, in &s;ome Form or other, been practi&s;ed in every civilized Nation.</P>
<P>There can be no Doubt, that the Ceremony of Anointing was borrowed from the Scriptures; and the <HI>Jews</HI> tell us, that all their Kings were anointed, from <HI>Saul</HI> to <HI>Hircanus.</HI> It pa&s;&s;ed from the <HI>Jews</HI> to other Nations, and &s;eems to have been practi&s;ed here &s;oon after the Introduction of Chri&s;tianity. The Monks indeed, would willingly per&s;uade us, that <HI>Alfred the Great,</HI> was the fir&s;t anointed King, and that he received his Unction from the Pope at <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
which may be true, in re&s;pect to the Unction; but then, as <HI>Alfred</HI> was a Child of five Years old, it is much more likely, that it was the Chri&s;m or Unction u&s;ed in the Ceremony of Confirmation, than the Regal Unction. It appears from <HI>Gildas,</HI> the mo&s;t ancient Writer of our own Nation, that is yet extant, that the Briti&s;h Kings were anointed; and this Practice was &s;o con&s;tant, that the common Phra&s;e in the old Chronicles, to expre&s;s the Acce&s;&s;ion of a Prince to the Government, is this, that at &s;uch a Time, he was anointed King. We have therefore u&s;ed this Ceremony as early, if not ear|lier, than any other Nation in Europe, as, if it was nece&s;&s;ary, might be very ea&s;ily &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of Crowns al&s;o is very ancient; and, in Proce&s;s of Time, grew to be of very different Forms. The Diadem was ori|ginally of Cloth, and bound about the Head like a Fillet. After|wards a Circle of Gold was in U&s;e, &s;ome times plain, as was the ancient Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ometimes adorned with Spires or Rays. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings u&s;ed both. The former being called King's-Band, and the latter King's-Helm, as being worn upon a Helmet. In latter Times, it was al&s;o worn without the Helm, as well as with it, as appears in the Coins of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings. Other Ornaments were gradually added, &s;uch as the Flower-de-Lis. At length the Emperor wore a Crown with Bars, ri&s;ing from the Sides, and join|ing at the Top, thence &s;tiled a Crown Imperial. Authors are not agreed, when this was fir&s;t introduced into <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay by <HI>Ed|ward</HI> III. on his being made Vicar General of the Empire, by <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> others by <HI>Henry</HI> V. Be that as it will, if an Imperial Crown is the Mark of Independent Sovereignty, then, no Doubt, our Kings have a Right to wear it, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;o they have long worn it.</P>
<P>There was not any thing, in which our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ance&s;tors were more curious and exact, than in their Religious Ceremonies; and therefore we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, they were particularly &s;o in the Inauguration; or, as their own emphatic Term was, in the hallow|ing their Kings. This we find frequently mentioned, in that au|thentic Hi&s;tory, &s;tiled the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle. This Solemnity, how|ever, was not confined anciently to any particular Place; for, among&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="5">
other Princes, <HI>Alfred,</HI> ju&s;tly &s;urnamed <HI>the Great,</HI> was crowned at <HI>Winche&s;ter, Ethel&s;tan,</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> where, as that Hi&s;tory tells us, there were mighty Rejoicings, and a great Re&s;ort of the Clergy and Nobili|ty upon the Occa&s;ion. But both in earlier and later Times than the&s;e, &s;everal of our Kings were crowned at <HI>King&s;ton</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> which from thence received its Name, and is therefore &s;tiled in <HI>Latin, Re|giodunum</HI> by <HI>Leland,</HI> who thinks that at &s;uch Times a Theatre was erected, that the whole Ceremony might be more con&s;picuous to the People. But <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or</HI> was crowned at <HI>Winche&s;ter;</HI> and it is particularly mentioned in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, that he re|ceived many grave Exhortations from the Archbi&s;hop, in relation to the Duties of his high Office. <HI>Harold</HI> was crowned at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> founded and &s;carce fini&s;hed by King <HI>Edward,</HI> and as that Chronicle &s;ays, by the Appointment of his Predece&s;&s;or, and by the Election of the People. In Re&s;pect to the Confe&s;&s;or's Memory, the Abbey of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> became in &s;ucceeding Times, the u&s;ual Place of our Monarch's Coronation, more e&s;pecially as the <HI>Regalia</HI> of that King were kept there.</P>
<P>In our old Hi&s;torians there are no Traces of the Ceremony, which is not to be wondered at, con&s;idering the Brevity of tho&s;e Annals; but in the Leidger books, and other Abbey Records, many Fragments are to be met with, of mo&s;t of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ceremonies, and among&s;t others of the Coronations of &s;ome of the&s;e Kings, from which it plainly appears, that the Forms in u&s;e after the Conque&s;t, and even the modern Forms, were borrowed from the&s;e; and this very pro|bably would be &s;till more evident, if we had any <HI>Saxon</HI> Ceremonial compleat. As it is, we &s;ee plainly that the different Prayers at the Unction, Crowning, putting the Sword, the Sceptre, and the Ball into the King's Hands, were taken from them; and, if we con&s;ider the Reverence ever paid to Antiquity, more e&s;pecially in Matters of this Kind, it will not certainly appear &s;trange.</P>
<P>After what has been related, it may &s;eem a little &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;ome of our able&s;t Antiquaries have complained, that they could meet with no &s;ettled or authentic Form of the Coronation of our Monarchs. But a little Con&s;ideration will &s;hew us, that we may ea&s;ily account for this, in a manner very con&s;i&s;tent with what has been
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
already &s;aid. While our Ance&s;tors continued Papi&s;ts the Ceremo|nial &s;till remained in <HI>Latin,</HI> tho' it may be not without Additions and Alterations. But after the Reformation farther Changes became nece&s;&s;ary, as we find by the very imperfect Accounts yet remaining of the Coronation of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in which his Oath, and no doubt, &s;ome other Parts were in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they might be under|&s;tood by the People. In Proce&s;s of Time, &s;everal of the Prayers and Collets grew ob&s;olete and uncouth in their Language, which therefore rendered it requi&s;ite to review and retouch them, in order to accommodate the Service to the Language of the Times in which it was performed. When therefore Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> was accu&s;ed of altering the Coronation Service, at the Inauguration of <HI>Charles</HI> I. he pleaded the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of this; he &s;aid, that the Muta|tions and Emendations, which were made in &s;ome Parts of the Ser|vice, were partly to render the Sen&s;e clear, and partly to make it proper in grammatical <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which, he &s;aid, was done by Royal Authority, in a Committee for that Purpo&s;e; but that no material or e&s;&s;ential Alterations were made, and that the King's Coronation Oath particularly remained untouched, and was the &s;ame with his Father's, which was &s;ettled by that pious and worthy Prelate, Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Whitgift.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, it may be truly affirmed, that the Bulk and Sub&s;tance of the Coronation Ceremony is the very &s;ame at this day, as it was above a thou&s;and Years ago; and if any thing has been retrenched, it has been owing to &s;uper&s;titious Circum&s;tances, &s;uper|induced on the ancient and venerable Form, which the <HI>Saxons</HI> had in u&s;e, and to which, even after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t, the Nation in general were &s;o much attached, that it was thought expedient to pre&s;erve it; though afterwards, when the Knowledge of this Form came to be lo&s;t with the People, the Clergy might po&s;&s;ibly intro|duce Expre&s;&s;ions more favourable to their own Power, and more &s;uitable to tho&s;e Notions they were de&s;irous &s;hould prevail. But the&s;e again, as we have before ob&s;erved, were at the Reformation curtailed or taken away.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
As to the Pieces that are here pre&s;ented to our Readers View, they are &s;uch as may contribute to give them a tolerable Idea of the Co|ronation of a King and Queen. It was in this View, that the Or|der for the Coronation of <HI>Charles</HI> II. was &s;elected, as being in mo&s;t Re&s;pects preferable to that of his Brother, which has been &s;o pomp|ou&s;ly di&s;played by Mr. <HI>Sandford,</HI> who&s;e Knowledge and Diligence we by no means would depreciate; and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that he re|ceived hath enabled him to render it a truly valuable Work, &s;o that it has been, and will be ju&s;tly regarded as the fitte&s;t Model for fu|ture Ceremonies of that Kind. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was not married at the Time of his Coronation, and therefore we have annexed the Ceremony of the Coronation of King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen, <HI>Mary,</HI> which will be found exactly agreeable to that of <HI>Sandford,</HI> with the Addi|tion of the Prayers, which, as well known at that Time, are, to &s;horten his Account, introduced with only a Line or two, and the Remainder dropt by an &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to the Notes, they relate to Per&s;ons and Things; with re&s;pect to the former, the Reader will find what in the Peru&s;al of &s;uch Pieces it is very natural to de&s;ire, the Names of tho&s;e Prelates who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at tho&s;e Ceremonies, which, as needle&s;s at that Juncture, were left out when they were originally publi&s;hed. In regard to the latter, they are calculated to explain the &s;everal Parts of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> and other Pa&s;&s;ages that &s;eem to require Elucidation, that the whole might be as plain and per&s;picuous as po&s;&s;ible. There is a Plea&s;ure in reviewing the Pomp of pa&s;t Triumphs, in recalling to our Re|membrance tho&s;e great Per&s;onages, who are long ago removed from our View, but whom the Fame of their Actions &s;till renders worthy of our Notice. The whole &s;tands now in &s;uch a Point of Light, as that the Ceremonies of the&s;e Coronations may be as clearly and as fully conceived, as if we had been pre&s;ent at them; and as far as could be judged, Care has been taken to an&s;wer every Que&s;|tion, that a judicious and inqui&s;itive Peru&s;er would naturally a&s;k in go|ing through them, the Omi&s;&s;ion of which &s;o frequently and &s;o greatly perplexes Relations of this Kind, and renders them more apt to rai&s;e than to &s;atisfy our Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8">
As to the Appendix, it is compo&s;ed of Pieces not commonly known, or ea&s;y to be found, as being either involved in large Works, where few would take the Pains to &s;eek them, or hid in the Clo&s;ets of Antiquaries, where it would have been no ea&s;y Matter to find them. The Account particularly of the Manner in which our an|cient <HI>Regalia</HI> was lo&s;t, and in what it con&s;i&s;ted, has &s;o near a Rela|tion to the Subject, and contributes &s;o much to &s;et it in a clearer Light, that it mu&s;t be allowed to de&s;erve a Place in &s;uch a Col|lection; as does al&s;o the Order of the &s;olemn Cavalcade from the <HI>Tower</HI> to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> which our Ance&s;tors e&s;teemed no incon&s;iderable Part of the Ceremony. The&s;e are likewi&s;e illu&s;trated with &s;uch Notes as appeared nece&s;&s;ary to explain them, and it is hoped, that the whole taken together will be found no unplea&s;ing, unentertain|ing, or unin&s;tructive Mi&s;cellany on the Subject of Coronations, which being the general Topic of Conver&s;ation at pre&s;ent occa&s;ioned their Publication, and as this has been attended with no &s;mall Degree of Ha&s;te, they are &s;ubmitted to the Candour of the Public.</P>

<HEAD>THE CEREMONY OF THE CORONATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>

<HEAD>The PROCEEDINGS on the Day of his MAJESTY'S Coronation were as follows:</HEAD>
<P>UPON <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> being <HI>St. George's</HI> Day, about half an hour after &s;even in the Morning, the KING entered in|to his Rich <HI>Barge,</HI> took Water from the Privy Stairs at <HI>White|hall,</HI> and landed at the Parliament Stairs, from whence he proceeded up to the Room behind the <HI>Lord's Hou&s;e</HI> called the <HI>Princes Lodgings;</HI> where, after he had repo&s;ed him&s;elf for a while, he was arrayed in his <HI>Royal Robes</HI> of <HI>Crim&s;on Velvet,</HI> furred with <HI>Ermine,</HI> by which time the Nobility being a&s;&s;embled, robed them&s;elves in the <HI>Lord's Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Painted Chamber.</HI></P>

The Coronation of a King or Queen, the Creation of a Prince of Wales, or of a Duke of York. The Order was &s;tyled of the Holy Trinity, tho' from the Ceremony of Bathing before they received the Honour of Knighthood, they were commonly &s;tyled Knights of the Bath. The Motto of the Order was anciently, <HI>Tria Numina juncta in uno,</HI> alluding to the My&s;tery of the Holy Trinity. But at the Coronation of King James the Fir&s;t, the Word <HI>Numina</HI> was omitted, and the Motto has ever &s;ince been <HI>Tria juncta in uno,</HI> alluding to the Union of the three Crowns. On this Occa&s;ion, Sixty-eight Gen|tlemen of the fir&s;t Families in the Kingdom, were created Knights of the Bath.</NOTE>, and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the <HI>Privy Chamber,</HI> met in the Court of <HI>Reque&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;ome Space, the King's <HI>Heralds</HI> and <HI>Pur&s;uivants</HI> began to &s;et the Proceeding in Order, each of them taking his Share, a&s;&s;igned in <HI>Chapter,</HI> held at the <HI>Heralds Office,</HI> the Evening before, and thence directed all the beforementioned Degrees, except the Nobility, down into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> where the re&s;t of the Proceeding attended, and from whence the March began.</P>

About half an hour after Nine, the Nobility having been fir&s;t called over in the Painted Chamber, proceeded each according to his Rank and Dignity, in their Robes and Coronets before the KING, through the Court of Reque&s;ts, into We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, a&s;cended up to the <HI>State,</HI> which was rai&s;ed at the <HI>We&s;t End,</HI> and placed them&s;elves upon each Side thereof.</P>

<P><HI>St. Edward's</HI> ancient <HI>Chair</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">This ancient Chair is of very &s;olid hard Wood, painted and wrought after a very antique Manner. It is in Height fix Foot &s;even Inches, in Breadth at the Bottom thirty-eight Inches, in Depth twenty-four Inches. From the Seat to the Bottom is twenty-five Inches, the Breadth of the Seat within the Side twenty-eight Inches, and the Depth eighteen Inches. The bottom Board nine Inches from the Ground is &s;upported at the four Corners by as many Lions, and between the Seat and this bottom Board is inclo&s;ed that Stone, which Hector Boethius calls <HI>Fatale Marmor.</HI> The Legend concerning it is this, that it is the very Stone on which the Patriarch Jacob repo&s;ed his Head in the Plain of Luz. It is of a blui&s;h Colour, mixed with &s;ome Veins of red, of an oblong Form, twenty two Inches long, thirteen broad, and eleven deep. It was brought to Bri|gantia in the Province of Galicia in Spain, by Gathel King of Scots, who u&s;ed it as his Throne. Tran&s;ported from thence into Ireland by Simon Brech the fir&s;t King of Scotland, who ruled there about Seven Hundred Years before Chrift. Three Hundred and Twenty Years after this, King Fergus removed it into Scotland, where, Anno Domini 859, it was placed in the Abby of Scoon by King Kenneth, who cau&s;ed it to be inclo&s;ed in this Wooden Chair with this Di&s;tich:
<Q><L>Ni fallat fatum, (&s;ome Copies read vatum) Scoti hunc quocunque locatum</L>
<L>Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</L></Q>
<Q><L>If Truth our Sages &s;peak, nor Fables feign;</L>
<L>Where'er this Stone is found; the Scots &s;hall reign.</L></Q>
Edward the Fir&s;t, in the twenty-fourth Year of his Reign Anno Domini 1296, having vanqui&s;hed John Baliol, brought it from Scotland, placed it in the Abby of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and dedicated it to St. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;ince which Time our Kings have been always &s;eated in it at their Co|ronation. The Prophecy is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fulfilled in the Per&s;on of James the Sixth of Scotland, and Fir&s;t of England, from whom his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty King George the Third is de|&s;cended in a direct line. <HI>See the</HI> Fronti&s;piece, A.</NOTE>, covered all over with Cloth of <HI>Gold,</HI> was placed upon the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> a little lower, than that belonging to the Archbi&s;hop; but &s;omething nearer the Middle of the I&s;le, and between the <HI>King's Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and the <HI>Pulpit.</HI></P>

<P>This fini&s;hed, the KING aro&s;e from the <HI>Fald&s;tool,</HI> and went to the <HI>Altar,</HI> &s;upported by the afore&s;aid Bi&s;hops of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> where he was di&s;robed by the Lord Great Chamberlain of his <HI>Royal Robes,</HI> which were immediately carried thence, into the <HI>Traver&s;e</HI> erected in <HI>St. Edward</HI>'s Chapel.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the <HI>Chair,</HI> that was before placed at the En|trance of the Stage, was removed and &s;et on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Al|tar,</HI> between it and <HI>St. Edward's Chair;</HI> whereunto the KING came, &s;at down, and was anointed by the &s;aid Archbi&s;hop, while the <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> held the AMPULLA<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">The Ampulla is in the Form of an Eagle, with Wings expanded &s;tanding on a Pede&s;tal, all of pure Gold, weighing about ten Ounces. The Eagle being hollow, un&s;crews in the Middle of the Neck, for the more ea&s;y putting in the Oil, which, when the King is anointed, is poured through the Beak. The French have an Ampulla, which is &s;aid to have been brought from Hea|ven by a white Dove, and which is kept in the Abby of S Remi, from whence it is brought in great Ceremony when the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King is crowned at Rheims In regard to this, our Po|pi&s;h Ance&s;tors were not behind; for the Reader may find, in Thomas Wal&s;ingham, that the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin gave to Thomas Becket, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, being then in Exile, a Holy Eagle full of Oil in a Stone Ve&s;&s;el, which he depo&s;ited in a Mona&s;tery at Poitiers. There, in the Reign of Edward III Henry I. Duke of Lanca&s;ter received it from a holy Man, who found it by a &s;econd Revelation. The Duke gave it to the Black Prince, who placed it in a &s;trong Che&s;t in the Tower, where his Son Richard the Second, &s;earching for his Father's Jewels, met with it, and pre&s;&s;ed the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to anoint him therewith; but the Archbi&s;hop told him, he had been once anointed, and that this Royal Unction could not be repeated. The King carried it over to Ireland, and at his Return from thence gave it to the Archbi&s;hop, who therewith anointed Henry the Fourth. In <HI>Sandford's Hi&s;tory of the Coronation of James the Second,</HI> we are told, the Oil for that Monarch's Coronation was prepared by his Order, by James St. Amand, E&s;q. Apo|thecary to that Prince, and which was &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated the Morning of the Coronation by the Dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Prebendaries. It was &s;o exceeding rich and fragrant, and &s;o highly approved of by the King and Queen, that he had two hundred Pounds paid him for it by the Trea&s;urer of the Hou&s;ehold, in Con&s;equence of a Warrant from the Lord Chamberlain.</NOTE> and poured the <HI>Oil</HI> into the

<P>All which Time, the KING &s;tood by his <HI>Throne.</HI></P>
<P>But, towards the End of the Creed, he again took his Crown from the Lord Great Chamberlain, and put it on his Head, as al&s;o the Scepter with the Cro&s;s from Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> and that with the Dove, from the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and prepared for his De&s;cent from his Throne, to|wards the <HI>Altar,</HI> to <HI>receive</HI> the <HI>Communion.</HI></P>
<P>And as &s;oon as the &s;inging of the <HI>Creed</HI> was fully ended, the KING de&s;cended with the <HI>Crown</HI> on his <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Scepters</HI> in both <HI>Hands,</HI> the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI> &s;upporting him, with the four Swords naked before, and all the great Officers of State attending.</P>

<P>At the End of which, the Lord <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> Trea&s;urer of the Hou&s;hold, pre&s;ented the KING with another <HI>Wedge</HI> of <HI>Gold,</HI> which goeth under the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Gold.</HI> This the KING <HI>offered</HI> into the <HI>Ba&s;on, kneel|ing</HI> &s;till at his <HI>Fald&s;tool,</HI> whil&s;t the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> &s;aid the following <HI>Prayer:</HI><Q>Almighty GOD, give thee of the Dew of Heaven, and of the Fat of the Earth, and abundance of Corn and Wine.

<P>In the mean while, the KING returned to his <HI>Throne,</HI> upon the <HI>Theatre,</HI> with the <HI>Crown</HI> on his Head, and the <HI>Scepters</HI> in his Hands.</P>
<P>When he came thither, he put off his <HI>Crown,</HI> and delivered it to the Lord Great Chamberlain; the <HI>Scepter</HI> with the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Howard;</HI> and that with the <HI>Dove,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Albemarle.</HI></P>

<P>The re&s;t of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> which lay all this while on the Altar, being delivered to the Noblemen, that brought them in the <HI>Proceeding</HI> to the Church, were carried before him; and thence the KING proceeded into <HI>St. Edward's</HI> Chapel, the Organs playing all the while.</P>

<P>The <HI>Proceeding</HI> being entered into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> the Nobility, and others who had Tables a&s;&s;igned them, went and placed them&s;elves there|at; but the KING, attended by the Great Officers, withdrew into the inner Court of Wards for half an Hour.

<P>Upon the left Hand of the King's Throne, below on the other Side of the Hall, was placed a long Table, whereat the Nobility dined, and this Table had four Side Tables to &s;erve it.</P>
<P>And behind this, clo&s;e to the Wall, at a &s;horter Table, &s;at the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and twelve Chief Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> who had al&s;o two Side Tables to &s;erve them.</P>
