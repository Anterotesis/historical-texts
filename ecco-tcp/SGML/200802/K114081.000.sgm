That independence Britons prize too high,</L>

<L>As duty, love, and honour fail to &s;way,</L>

<L>Hence all di&s;tinction's paid to the&s;e alone,</L>
<L>Talent mu&s;t &s;ink, and merit weep unknown;</L>
<L>Till Time may come, when, &s;tript of all her charms,</L>
<L>That land of &s;cholars, and that nur&s;e of arms;</L>
<L>Where ance&s;try avows the noble claim,</L>
<L>And &s;tate&s;men toil, and poets pant for fame;</L>
<L>To men of other minds my fancy flies,</L>

Methinks her patient &s;ons before me &s;tand,</L>

<L>Onward methinks, and diligently &s;low</L>
<L>The firm connected bulwark &s;eems to go;</L>
<L>While ocean pent, and ri&s;ing o'er the pile,</L>

<L>Thus, while around the wave-&s;ubjected &s;oil</L>
<L>Impels the native to repeated toil,</L>
<L>Indu&s;trious habits in each brea&s;t obtain,</L>
<L>And indu&s;try begets a love of gain.</L>
<L>Hence all the good from opulence that &s;prings,</L>
<L>With all tho&s;e ills &s;uperfluous trea&s;ure brings,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7">
Are here di&s;play'd. Their much-lov'd wealth imparts</L>
<L>Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;</L>
<L>But turn the medal, craft and fraud appear,</L>
<L>Even liberty it&s;elf is barter'd here.</L>
<L>At gold's &s;uperior charms all freedom flies,</L>
<L>The needy &s;ell it, and the rich man buys:</L>
<L>A land of tyrants, and a den of &s;laves,</L>

<LG>
<L>Heavens! how unlike their Belgic &s;ires of old!</L>
<L>Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold;</L>
<L>Where &s;hading elms be&s;ide the margin grew,</L>

<L>And haply, tho' my har&s;h touch faltering &s;till,</L>

<L>Yet would the village prai&s;e my wond'rous power,</L>
<L>And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.</L>
<L>Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days</L>
<L>Have led their children through the mirthful maze,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8">
And the gay grand&s;ire, &s;kill'd in ge&s;tic lore,</L>
<L>Has fri&s;k'd beneath the burthen of three&s;core.</L>

<L>So ble&s;t a life the&s;e thoughtle&s;s realms di&s;play,</L>

<L>Honour, that prai&s;e which real merit gains,</L>
<L>Or even imaginary worth obtains,</L>

<L>It &s;hifts its &s;plendid traffic round the land:</L>
<L>From courts to camps, to cottages it &s;trays,</L>
<L>And all are taught an avarice of prai&s;e;</L>
<L>They plea&s;e, are pleas'd, they give to get e&s;teem,</L>
<L>Till, &s;eeming ble&s;t, they grow to what they &s;eem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while this &s;ofter art their bli&s;s &s;upplies,</L>
<L>It gives their follies al&s;o room to ri&s;e;</L>
<L>For prai&s;e too dearly lov'd, or warmly &s;ought,</L>
<L>Enfeebles all internal &s;trength of thought,</L>
<L>And the weak &s;oul, within it&s;elf unble&s;t,</L>
<L>Leans for all plea&s;ure on another's brea&s;t.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9">
Hence o&s;tentation here, with tawdry art,</L>
<L>Pants for the vulgar prai&s;e which fools impart;</L>
<L>Here vanity a&s;&s;umes the pert grimace,</L>
<L>And trims her robes of frize with copper lace,</L>
<L>Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</L>
<L>To boa&s;t one &s;plendid di&s;h for once a year;</L>
<L>And &s;carce a man is found, who rightly weighs</L>
<L>The &s;olid tran&s;ports of internal prai&s;e.</L>
<L>The&s;e are the charms to barren &s;tates a&s;&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>Their wants are few, their wi&s;hes all confin'd.</L>
<L>Yet let them only &s;hare the prai&s;es due,</L>
<L>If few their wants, their plea&s;ures are but few;</L>
<L>Since every want, that &s;timulates the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Becomes a means of plea&s;ure when po&s;&s;e&s;t.</L>
<L>Hence from &s;uch lands each plea&s;ing &s;cience flies,</L>
<L>That fir&s;t excites de&s;ire, and then &s;upplies;</L>
<L>Unknown to them, when &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures cloy,</L>
<L>To fill the languid pau&s;e with finer joy;</L>
<L>Unknown tho&s;e powers that rai&s;e the &s;oul to flame,</L>
<L>Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame.</L>
<L>Their level life is but a &s;mould'ring fire,</L>
<L>Nor quench'd by want, nor fan'd by &s;trong de&s;ire;</L>

Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not their joys alone thus coar&s;ly flow:</L>
<L>Their morals, like their plea&s;ures, are but low.</L>
<L>For, as refinement &s;tops, from &s;ire to &s;on</L>
<L>Manners in one unmending track will run,</L>
<L>And love and friend&s;hip's finely pointed dart</L>
<L>Fall blunted from each indurated heart,</L>
<L>Some &s;terner virtues o'er the mountain's brea&s;t</L>
<L>May &s;it, like falcons cow'ring on the ne&s;t;</L>

<L>No Zephyr fondly &s;ooths the mountain's brea&s;t,</L>
<L>But meteors glare, and frowning &s;torms inve&s;t.</L>
<L>Yet &s;till, even here, content can &s;pread a charm,</L>

<L>Though poor the pea&s;ant's hut, his fea&s;ts though &s;mall,</L>

<L>No co&s;tly lord the &s;umptuous banquet deal</L>
<L>To make him loath his vegetable meal;</L>
<L>But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,</L>
<L>Each wi&s;h contracting, fits him to the &s;oil.</L>
<L>Chearful at morn he wakes from &s;hort repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Brea&s;ts the keen air, and carrols as he goes;</L>
<L>With patient angle trolls the finny deep,</L>
<L>Or drives his vent'rous plow-&s;hare to the &s;teep;</L>
<L>Or &s;eeks the den where &s;now tracks mark the way,</L>

<L>For wealth was theirs, nor far remov'd the date,</L>
