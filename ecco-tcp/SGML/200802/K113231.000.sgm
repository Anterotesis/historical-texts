<HEAD>A LECTURE ON LECTURES, By LANCELOT LAST; As delivered with Applau&s;e in the COMIC MIRROUR. Written by G. S. CAREY.</HEAD>
<P>LADIES and Gemmen, I am going pre|&s;ently, as you will pre&s;ently find, to give you a Lecture on Lectures; but fir&s;t and fore|ma&s;t, I think it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould give &s;ome account of my&s;elf, becau&s;e why, a man who can give no account of him&s;elf, is to all intents and purpo&s;es a <HI>vagram.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, as to my name, Lancelot La&s;t, at your &s;ervice, by trade, when I u&s;ed to follow it, a Shoe-maker; but happening to &s;ee one of your lectures in our town, I was in&s;pired, as it were;
<PB N="54" REF="53">
and knowing him to be no better a <HI>&s;chollard</HI> than my&s;elf, I took off my <HI>apron,</HI> threw down my <HI>lap-&s;tone,</HI> kick'd up my <HI>la&s;t,</HI> gave up my <HI>awl,</HI> and &s;o &s;ate off to lecture.</P>
<P>I was a long time before I could determine with my&s;elf what &s;ubject to begin upon, at la&s;t <HI>Stronomy</HI> came into my head, but I found the &s;tars were out of my reach, and whenever I dipp'd into that &s;cience, I was pre&s;ently lo&s;t as it were, in a cloud.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Ottamy</HI> came into my head, I was at home to a peg in <HI>Ottomy,</HI> for as to plucking out a tooth, picking out a corn, or curing the gripes, nobody is more &s;kilful than my&s;elf; but when I came to the <HI>imputation</HI> of a leg, and as I am na|turally tender-hearted, I found it too <HI>cutting</HI> a bu&s;ine&s;s for me.</P>
<P>Then &s;ays I to my&s;elf, what think'&s;t thou Lancelot La&s;t of Chymi&s;try, I thought as how that bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;omething in my way, for as to your <HI>con&s;alves</HI> and <HI>pre&s;arves,</HI> nobody is more <HI>larned</HI> in that way than my&s;elf, but then <HI>thinks</HI> I again, &s;ome of my auditors may have an objection to the name of phy&s;ic, and phy&s;ic now-a-days is nothing but a <HI>drug.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54">Then Heraldry came into my head, but hap|pening to &s;ee the king's arms on a hackney-coach, I thought the dignity of that &s;cience was gone to the dogs.</P>
<P>I was advi&s;ed by a friend to &s;et about Mid|wifery. But my mind was big with a thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions whenever I thought on midwifery, &s;o I gave it up because I thought I &s;hould never be able to <HI>deliver</HI> my&s;elf on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I would have &s;et about a Lecture on Heads, but my friend, Alexander Stevens, had di&s;&s;ected every head in the kingdom &s;o well, that I &s;hould have been &s;et down as one of his <HI>block-heads,</HI> if I had meddled with ever a one.</P>
<P>I thought the <HI>Heart</HI> would be no bad &s;ubject, but I could find &s;o very few good ones, that I had not a heart to &s;et about it.</P>
<P>Thinking of bad hearts put the <HI>Law</HI> into my head, and I thought a Lecture on the Law would be no bad thing; then &s;ays I to my&s;elf, the Law is no good thing in it&s;elf, but would it not be better if I could make a good &s;ubject out of it. I thought and I ponder'd about it 'till I found
<PB N="56" REF="55">
my&s;elf like a poor fly in a cobweb. The law always puts me in mind of a coffin&mdash;once in, your never out again.</P>
<P>If none of the&s;e &s;ubjects will do, what in the name of Lucifer will do,&mdash;Lucifer! who the devil is Lucifer?&mdash;A great orator mayhap.&mdash; Odds-bobbs, an orator.&mdash;It directly came into my head that a lecture on oratory would be the be&s;t thing I could &s;et about, and &s;o I begins my lecture on oratory.</P>
<P>Ladies and gemmen, now according to the learned, and I am &s;omething of a <HI>&s;chollard</HI> my&s;elf. Oratory means jawing, becau&s;e why, why be|cau&s;e no orator can &s;peak without his jaws; perhaps you'll think I can't give you a Latin <HI>devination</HI> for it, now you'll find your&s;elves mi&s;taken, what is Engli&s;h for <HI>Os?</HI> why bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to be &s;ure, and the jaws being full of bones&punc; they are <HI>fix'd</HI> proofs that the word oratory comes from <HI>Os.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould know what an orator is&mdash;&mdash;and what is it you will &s;ay; I an&s;wer, it is a man&mdash;and what is he to do?&mdash;I an&s;wer, to &s;peak words&mdash;&mdash;and
<PB N="57" REF="56">
what are words?&mdash;I an&s;wer, letters put together, but there can be no word without a <HI>wowel</HI>;&mdash; becau&s;e why; why do you &s;ee, becau&s;e they can't.</P>
<P>What are the nece&s;&s;ary qualities of an ora|tor&mdash;&mdash;The fir&s;t, he mu&s;t &s;pit, then wipe his mouth, then lay his hand upon his heart, then turn up his eyes, then out comes a word, then another follows it, and then, like a po&s;t hor&s;e, let him get on as fa&s;t as he can.</P>
<P>An orator &s;hould be a good mimic too&mdash; Odds-bobbs, now I talk of mimics, I mu&s;t take care what I am about, for I am &s;urrounded by mimics here, and they will be for taking me off, perhaps, now you &s;hall &s;ee I will &s;ave them the trouble, and take off my&s;elf.</P>
