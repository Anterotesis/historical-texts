<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<P>_THIS A&s;tronomical In|&s;trument (which is made agreeably to the <HI>Coper|nican</HI> Sy&s;tem, and there|fore by me named the <HI>COPERNICUS)</HI> con&s;i&s;ts (be&s;ides the im|moveable Circle on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ut&s;ide, and the &s;mall moveable central Circle within) of ten intermediate con|centrical <HI>Annuli,</HI> or broad circular Rings, fitted to revolve one within another; but &s;o, as to be capable of being fix'd,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
by &s;mall Pins, in any &s;ituation what&s;o|ever. Six of the Circles toward the Center are &s;o contriv'd, that they may be taken away, upon occa&s;ion; and yet when they are put in, they are fa&s;t con|nected to the Frame, as well as the other, and revolve as freely as they do. There is al&s;o a Terre&s;trial Globe, of nine Inches Diameter, plac'd under the inner Circles, with its Hour Circle, turning along with it in its Diurnal Motion: And when tho&s;e Circles are remov'd, the Globe may be &s;o elevated and fix'd at any height, and &s;o regula|ted by Screws, as to be ready for the Exhibition of tho&s;e Eclip&s;es, which the &s;ix outward Circles a&s;&s;i&s;t us to di&s;cover; to which la&s;t does al&s;o belong a Rule, with a Groove, containing an Angle of 5&deg; 37&prime; for the Moon's Path in Eclip|&s;es. There is al&s;o a round Plate of Gla&s;s, with 12 Concentrical Circles therein, for the 12 Digits in Solar Eclip|&s;es; who&s;e Diameter bears the &s;ame proportion to the Diameter of the Globe, that the apparent Semidiameters of the Sun and Moon put together, do really bear to the Disk of the Earth in tho&s;e Eclip&s;es. There is, be&s;ides, a Map of the Moon, with 6 Concentrical Cir|cles, for the 12 Digits in Lunar Eclip&s;es;
<PB N="3" REF="5">
who&s;e Diameter bears the &s;ame proporti|on to that of the Globe, which the real Diameter of the Moon bears to the real Diameter of the Earth. There is al&s;o a dark Circle, repre&s;enting that Section of the Earth's Conical Shadow, along which the Moon pa&s;&s;es in its own Eclip|&s;es; and is &s;o much le&s;s in proportion than the Diameter of the Globe, as is that of the real corre&s;ponding Cir|cle to that of the Earth it &s;elf. There are al&s;o two Threads, with their Plum|mets, fix'd to the Center of the In&s;tru|ment; of frequent u&s;e in its Operati|ons.</P>
<P>THE Nature of the &s;everal Parts of this In&s;trument is as follows:</P>
<P>THE outmo&s;t, or large&s;t Circle, which is immovable, is the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> with its known Signs, <HI>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &amp;c.</HI> This Circle is divided equally, from the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> into 360 Degrees, or 12 Signs of 30 Degrees apiece; and is the Mea|&s;ure and Standard of the whole In&s;tru|ment. Every Planet, or Point, or Line being &s;till fix'd, by knowing its Place along this Circle, either by the Signs, with the particular Degrees and Mi|nutes,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
or by the bare number of Degrees and Minutes from the <HI>Equinox.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second Circle is for the Months and Days of the Year; which Days being, in a manner, equal, this Circle is equally divided into 365 Parts; which is the number of Days in a <HI>Ju|lian</HI> common Year. Nor will the <HI>Leap Year</HI> cau&s;e any great trouble, though it has one more Day in <HI>February;</HI> &s;ince it is already allow'd for in tho&s;e A&s;trono|mical Tables, whence all our Numbers have been transferr'd into this In&s;tru|ment; and any Day therein, after <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> is counted one farther than in the common Year. But here &s;everal things are to be noted; <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) That I &s;uppo&s;e every Body can readily tell, in any Month of any Year, how re|mote every Day of it is from the be|ginning of that Year; and this both in common, and in Leap Years; and &s;o can readily change one way of Compu|tation for the other, as occa&s;ion &s;hall re|quire: Thus we know by the old Me|morial Ver&s;es, that,
<Q><PB N="5" REF="7">
<L>Thirty Days hath September,</L>
<L>April, June, and November:</L>
<L>February eight and twenty alone,</L>
<L>And all the re&s;t have thirty and one.</L></Q>
Accordingly, we can tell, that <HI>April</HI> 22<HI>d,</HI> the Day of the next total Eclip&s;e of the Sun, in this common Year, is the 112<HI>th</HI> day of the Year: As al&s;o, that <HI>Sept.</HI> 29<HI>th,</HI> or <HI>Michaelmas</HI> day, next Year, which is <HI>Leap Year,</HI> will be the 273<HI>d</HI> Day of that Year; and &s;o in all other Ca&s;es what&s;oever. (2.) That in ca&s;e we fix any one Day of the Circle rightly to that Place in the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> whereto it belongs, every other Day of the &s;ame Circle will thereby be rightly plac'd al&s;o. (3.) That I have therefore &s;et down upon this Circle, the true Place of the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> for the pa&s;t Ages, as well as for the pre&s;ent: So that 'tis but bringing either the particular Year of our Lord it &s;elf <HI>&s;ince,</HI> or any one which proceeded it <HI>before Chri&s;t,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> and the whole Circle of Months is right|ly plac'd, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> for that time. (4.) That yet if we de|&s;ire to be exact, we mu&s;t, in this ca&s;e, con&s;ider further, what Year it is from <HI>Leap Year</HI> that we are concern'd with;
<PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y">
for if it be the fir&s;t after it (which the fir&s;t of each Century and Score <HI>&s;ince,</HI> and the fourth of each Century and Score <HI>before Chri&s;t</HI> always are) the Po&s;ition of the Numbers is right of it &s;elf, without any more con&s;ideration: But if it be the &s;econd after it, the Circle is to be turn'd one third of a Century's Motion, or one quarter of a Day forward; if it be the third, two thirds of a Century's Motion, or one half of a Day forwards, in order to its right Po&s;ition; while if it be it &s;elf Leap Year, the Circle mu&s;t be tur|ned one quarter of a Day backward, in order to &s;uch a Po&s;ition. (5.) Our A&s;tronomical Centuries, Years, Months, and Days do ever commence from the Noon foregoing; &s;o our 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> in this In&s;trument begins at Noon <HI>March</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> and ends at Noon <HI>March</HI> 1O<HI>th;</HI> and is indeed reckon'd by 24 Hours intire, from the one Noon to the other. Thus, becau&s;e this is the third after <HI>Leap Year,</HI> I turn this &s;econd Circle onward half a day, and find, that the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI> happens this Year, <HI>March</HI> 9. <HI>d.</HI> 18 <HI>h.</HI> 0 <HI>m.</HI> or as we commonly reckon, on <HI>March</HI> 10. about Six of the Clock in the Morn|ing; and that, by con&s;equence, <HI>April</HI> 21. <HI>d.</HI> 9 <HI>h.</HI> 42 <HI>m.</HI> the time of the middle of the next great Eclip&s;e of the Sun, corre&s;|ponds
<PB N="7" REF="9">
ponds to the 13&deg; of <HI>Taurus,</HI> in the out|mo&s;t Circle of the <HI>Ecliptick.</HI></P>
<P>THE Third Circle is the Annual Elliptick Orbit of the Earth, here right|ly repre&s;ented by a Circle; with the un|equal Divi&s;ions of the <HI>Ellip&s;is,</HI> corre&s;pon|ding to the inequality of the Earth's Motion. This Circle is fix'd to the due place of the Ecliptick by a &s;mall Arch, of the place of the <HI>Perihelion</HI>; as the Days of the Month were fix'd to the <HI>Equinox.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fourth Circle contains the Men&s;trual Orbit of the Moon, with its Periodical Revolution about the Earth; both in 360 Parts, and in 27 Days, 7 Hours, and 43 Minutes. The actual Divi&s;ions are here made for the mean State of the Orbit, which is variable; but Points are &s;et at every five Degrees (to be thence &s;upply'd at every De|gree, and proportionably in other Ca|&s;es) according to its &s;everal Degrees of Eccentricity. Upon the inner large part of this Circle there is al&s;o a Spiral Line, with the progre&s;&s;ive mean Mo|tion of the Moon's <HI>Apogee</HI> for a Century; with every one of the Months, and almo&s;t Days Motion al&s;o; That &s;o
<PB N="8" REF="10">
when we have fix'd, by a proper Table, the mean Place of the <HI>Apogee,</HI> for the beginning of any Century, we may thereby find its mean Place to any time in the &s;ame Century al&s;o, without any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE Fifth Circle contains, along its &s;piral, the mean Motion of the Moon's Nodes; and particularly, of the A&s;cending Node whence the Numbers begin, for an intire Century, with its Months and Days; that &s;o when we have, by a proper Table, once fix'd that Node right for the beginning of any Century, we may, as before, be hereby enabled to place it right at any time in the &s;ame Century, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Only we mu&s;t here note, that the Motion of the Nodes being retrograde, the Numbers on this Circle are counted backward.</P>
<P>THE Sixth Circle contains, in a &s;piral, the mean Motion of the Moon for the &s;everal Days in the Year, num|ber'd at length: And the Moon's mean Motion for the di&s;tinct Years of the Century are put at the utmo&s;t edge of the Circle, for our future Benefit in this Ca&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">THUS far I have de&s;crib'd the large&s;t and principal Circles, intended for the Di&s;covery of the New and Full Moons; and e&s;pecially for the Calcula|tion of Eclip&s;es, both Solar and Lunar.</P>
<P>AS to tho&s;e &s;ix le&s;&s;er Circles that follow to the Center, they need little Explication, being all of a piece; and are indeed nothing but broad <HI>Annuli,</HI> or Rings, to contain the Orbits of &s;uch of the Primary Planets as could be put upon them; with the Orbits of all the Secondary Planets, both tho&s;e about <HI>Sa|turn,</HI> and tho&s;e about <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in their due Proportions; that &s;o, when the Sun is &s;uppos'd in the Center, the Orbits of the Primary Planets may alone be made u&s;e of; when <HI>Saturn</HI> is there His; and when <HI>Jupiter</HI> is there His <HI>Satellites</HI> may alone be contemplated. Only we mu&s;t here note &s;everal things, for the better under&s;tanding of this Part of our In&s;tru|ment. (1.) Becau&s;e <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Orbits were too large for the&s;e inner Circles, they are repre&s;ented by &s;mall Spheres, on the &s;econd and &s;ixth larger Circles before de&s;crib'd; becau&s;e <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Motion is only about 12 Degrees in a Year, or one in a Month; as al&s;o <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s
<PB N="10" REF="12">
only about 30 Degrees in a Year, or 2&frac12; in a Month; there is no great nece&s;&s;ity for the&s;e di&s;tinct Orbits, with their Motions, to be engrav'd upon the&s;e Circles; e&s;pecially becau&s;e of the Confu&s;ion it would introduce there. (2.) The&s;e Orbits are here Circular, or accommodated to the Planets mean Di&s;tances from the Sun; but &s;o, that the pre&s;ent Places of the <HI>Aphelia</HI> and <HI>Perihelia</HI> are noted on the utmo&s;t edge of the whole In&s;trument, and the quan|tity of their &s;everal con&s;tant Eccentrici|ties are al&s;o noted where their Orbits begin; that &s;o the little Sphere repre|&s;enting each Planet, may be ever plac'd nearer to or farther from the Center, as its real Di&s;tance &s;hall require; only the Eccentricities of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s and <HI>Venus</HI>'s Orbits are too &s;mall to be here &s;en&s;ible. (3.) The&s;e Orbits are all repre&s;ented in the Plain of the Ecliptick, as it was here nece&s;&s;ary to do: But then the pre&s;ent Places of the A&s;cending and De&s;cend|ing Nodes being &s;et down at the utmo&s;t Edge, each Planet's Inclination to the Ecliptick, and Latitude on the Earth, may be nearly di&s;cover'd for this Age at the &s;ame time; I mean this, in ca&s;e we ob&s;erve the quantity of the &s;everal Angles of Inclination, which tho&s;e Orbits
<PB N="11" REF="13" MS="y">
make with the Ecliptick, which are as follows:

(4.) The &s;eeming Motions of the&s;e <HI>Aphelia</HI> and Nodes in the Ecliptick, is only a Degree in 72 Years: 'Tis there|fore but allowing to the&s;e <HI>Aphelia</HI> and Nodes that Motion of one Degree in 72 Years forwards, and their Places in the Ecliptick are known for all Ages. (5.) When <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Secondary Planets are concern'd, the Sun is to be &s;uppos'd in its proper Place of the Ecliptick, at the di&s;tance of 294 Feet from the Center of the In&s;trument: In which Ca&s;e the&s;e Orbits are in true Proportions, with regard thereto. And when <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s are concern'd, it is to be &s;uppos'd, in the like place, at 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Feet di&s;tance, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es. At which Points, if a Lamp be plac'd, and this In&s;trument be mov'd in a kind of Circular Orbit about it, we &s;hall have a ju&s;t and na|tural Repre&s;entation of the Revolution

<P><HI>To Rectifie the fir&s;t moveable Circle, or that of the Months and Days, to any Moment of Time, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come.</HI></P>

<P>TURN this Circle till the given Year, exactly corre&s;ponds to the <HI>beginning of Aries,</HI> in the outmo&s;t Cir|cle; but &s;o, that for the &s;econd Year after <HI>Leap Year</HI> you turn it farther one third; for the third Year two thirds of a Century's Motion <HI>forwards</HI>; and for the <HI>Leap Year</HI> one third <HI>backwards,</HI> beyond that beginning of <HI>Aries.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS is readily done, by bring|ing its beginning to the time a&s;|&s;ign'd in the Arch; and is &s;o ea&s;ie and obvious, as to need no farther Expli|cation. Only it mu&s;t be noted, that this Place of the <HI>Perihelion,</HI> with regard to the Earth, is the Place of the <HI>Aphe|lion,</HI>

<P>LOOK in the proper Table for the place of the Moon's <HI>Apogee,</HI> at the beginning of the Century a&s;|&s;ign'd, and accordingly fix it: Count along the Spiral that is upon it the Years, Months, and part of a Month of that Century, and lay one of your Threads over that Place; then remove the <HI>Apogee</HI> to that Thread; this will exactly &s;hew its mean Place.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving found the <HI>Heliocentrick</HI> and <HI>Geocentrick</HI> Places of the Planets, and &s;et &s;mall Spheres to repre&s;ent 'em: From the Sphere repre&s;enting any Pla|net lay two Rules or Threads, &s;o as to touch the Earth's Orbit on both &s;ides. If the Earth be con&s;iderably <HI>without</HI> that mixtilinear Triangle, the Planet is Di|rect; if con&s;iderably <HI>within</HI> it, it is Re|trograde; if <HI>about the Limit,</HI> it is Statio|nary: or at lea&s;t lately was, or &s;oon will be &s;o. Nor can you by this means ab&s;olutely determin, near tho&s;e Limits, whether the Planet be Direct, Statio|nary, or Retrograde. But then, by finding its Geocentrick Place two &s;eve|ral times within a few Days of one ano|ther, and ob&s;erving whether the Planet
<PB N="50" REF="52">
at the latter time be farther, or in the &s;ame Place, or not &s;o far in the Eclip|tick as it was at the former time, you may entirely determin the Problem. Nor is the Ca&s;e of the Inferior Planets much different from that of the Superi|or ones, as to this matter. Only Note, that the Rules or Threads mu&s;t be laid from the Earth to touch their Orbits; which is the <HI>Station,</HI> or Limit of the <HI>Di|rection</HI> and <HI>Retrogradation</HI> of tho&s;e Pla|nets, and is call'd their <HI>utmo&s;t Elongation</HI>; and that the Inferior Planets Po&s;ition near tho&s;e Limits, are here corre&s;pon|dent to the Earth's Po&s;ition in the Su|perior.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE time of Oppo&s;ition is the time of the Middle of any Eclip&s;e; and by taking away and adding the half duration of that Eclip&s;e, you have the time of the Immer&s;ion and Emer&s;ion.

<P><HI>Note al&s;o, that till we have more exact and &s;uitable Tables of the re&s;t of the&s;e Secon|dary Planets, it will be proper, two Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to ob&s;erve the Po&s;ition of as many as we can of them; and from tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations to fix their Pla|ces, with relation to their Primary ones, to tho&s;e times.
