<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome &s;ubjects on which a writer mu&s;t decline all attempts to acquire fame, &s;atisfied with being ob&s;curely u&s;eful. After &s;uch a number of Roman Hi&s;tories, in all languages, ancient and modern, it would be but impo&s;ture to pretend new di&s;coveries, or to expect to offer any thing in a work of this kind, which has not been often anticipated by others. The facts which it relates, have been an hundred times repeated, and every occur|rence has been &s;o variou&s;ly con&s;idered, that learning can &s;carce find a new anecdote, or ge|nius give novelty to the old.</P>
<P>I hope, therefore, for the readers indulgence, if in the following attempt it &s;hall appear, that my only aim was to &s;upply a conci&s;e, plain, and unaffected narrative of the ri&s;e and decline of a well known empire; I was contented to make &s;uch a book, as could not fail of being
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
&s;erviceable, though of all others, the mo&s;t un|likely to promote the reputation of the writer. In&s;tead therefore of pre&s;&s;ing forward among the ambitious, I only claim the merit of knowing my own &s;trength, and falling back among the hindmo&s;t ranks, with con&s;cious inferiority.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant however, that it would be no &s;uch difficult ta&s;k to pur&s;ue the &s;ame arts by which many dull men, every day, acquire a re|putation in hi&s;tory; &s;uch might ea&s;ily be at|tained, by fixing on &s;ome ob&s;cure period to write upon, where much &s;eeming erudition might be di&s;played, almo&s;t unknown, becau&s;e not worth remembering, and many maxims in politics might be advanced entirely new, be|cau&s;e altogether fal&s;e. But I have pur&s;ued a contrary method, chu&s;ing the mo&s;t noted pe|riod in hi&s;tory, and offering no remarks but &s;uch as I thought &s;trictly true.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons of my choice were, that we had no hi&s;tory of this &s;plendid period in our lan|guage, but was either too voluminous for com|mon u&s;e, or too meanly written to plea&s;e. Ca|trou and Rouille's hi&s;tory in &s;ix volumes, folio, tran&s;lated into our language by Bundy, is en|tirely un&s;uited to the time and expence man|kind u&s;ually chu&s;e to be&s;tow upon this &s;ubject: Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters"> and his continuator, Crevier, making above thirty volumes octavo, &s;eem to labour under the &s;ame imputation; as likewi&s;e Hooke,
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
who has &s;pent three quartos upon the republic alone; the re&s;t of his undertaking remaining unfini&s;hed. There only therefore remained the hi&s;tory of Echard, in five volumes octavo, who&s;e plan and mine &s;eemed to coincide, and had his execution been equal to his de&s;ign, it had precluded the pre&s;ent undertaking. But the truth is, it is &s;o poorly written, the facts &s;o crowded, the narration &s;o &s;piritle&s;s, and the characters &s;o indi&s;tinctly marked, that the mo&s;t ardent curio&s;ity mu&s;t cool in the peru&s;al, and the noble&s;t tran&s;actions that ever warmed the human heart, as de&s;cribed by him, mu&s;t cea&s;e to intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured therefore in the pre&s;ent work (or rather compilation) to obviate the in|conveniencies ari&s;ing from the exuberance of the former, as well as from the unplea&s;antne&s;s of the latter. It was &s;uppo&s;ed, that two vo|lumes might be made to comprize all that was requi&s;ite to be known, or plea&s;ing to be read, by &s;uch as only examined hi&s;tory, to prepare them for more important &s;tudies. Too much time may be given even to laudable pur&s;uits, and there is none more apt than this, to allure the &s;tudent from more nece&s;&s;ary branches of learning, and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, entirely to engro&s;s his indu&s;try. What is here offered therefore, may be &s;ufficient for all, but &s;uch as make hi&s;tory the peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s of their
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
lives; to &s;uch, the mo&s;t tedious narrative will &s;eem but an abridgment, as they mea&s;ure the merits of a work, rather by the quantity, than the quality of its contents. Others, however, who think more &s;oberly, will agree, that in &s;o exten&s;ive a field as that of the tran&s;actions of Rome, more judgment may be &s;hewn, by &s;e|lecting what is important, than by adding what is ob&s;cure. The hi&s;tory of this empire has been extended to &s;ix volumes folio, and I aver, that with very little learning, it might be encrea&s;ed to &s;ixteen more; but what would this be, but to load the &s;ubject with unimportant facts, and &s;o to weaken the narration, as that, like the em|pire it de&s;cribed, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink be|neath the weight of its own acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>But while I thus have endeavoured to avoid prolixity, it was found no ea&s;y matter to pre|vent crowding the facts, and to give every nar|rative its proper play. In reality, no art can continue to avoid oppo&s;ite defects; he who indulges in minute particularities, will be often languid; and he who &s;tudies conci&s;ene&s;s, will as frequently be dry and unentertaining. As it was my aim to comprize as much as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;malle&s;t compa&s;s, it is feared the work will often be &s;ubject to the latter imputation; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to furni&s;h the public with a cheap Roman hi&s;tory in two volumes octavo, and at the &s;ame time to give all that warmth to
<PB N="v" REF="6">
the narrative, all tho&s;e colourings to the de&s;crip|tion, which works of twenty times the bulk have room to exhibit. I &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied therefore, if it furni&s;hes an intere&s;t &s;ufficient to allure the reader to the end, and this is a claim, to which few abridgements can ju&s;tly make pre|ten&s;ions.</P>
<P>To the&s;e objections, there are &s;ome who may add, that I have rejected many of the modern improvements in Roman hi&s;tory, and that every character is left in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fame or infamy which it obtained from its cotempo|raries, or tho&s;e who wrote immediately after. I acknowledge the charge, for it appears now too late to rejudge the virtues or the vices of tho&s;e men, who were but very incompletely known even to their own hi&s;torians. The Ro|mans perhaps, upon many occa&s;ions, formed wrong ideas of virtue, but they were by no means &s;o ignorant or abandoned in general, as not to give their brighte&s;t characters the greate&s;t &s;hare of their applau&s;e, and I do not know whether it be fair, to try pagan actions by the &s;tandard of chri&s;tian morality.</P>
<P>But whatever may be my execution of this work, I have very little doubts about the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the undertaking; the &s;ubject is the no|ble&s;t that ever employed human attention, and in&s;tead of requiring a writer's aid, will even &s;upport him with its &s;plendor. The Empire
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
of the world ri&s;ing from the meane&s;t origin, and growing great by a &s;trict veneration for re|ligion, and an implicit confidence in its com|manders: continually changing the mode, but &s;eldom the &s;pirit of its government, being a con&s;titution, in which the military power, whe|ther under the name of citizens or &s;oldiers, al|mo&s;t always prevailed: adopting all the im|provements of other nations with the mo&s;t in|defatigable indu&s;try, and &s;ubmitting to be taught by tho&s;e whom it afterwards &s;ubdued. This is a picture that mu&s;t affect us, however it be di&s;po&s;ed; the&s;e materials mu&s;t have their value, under the hand of the meane&s;t work|man.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of the origin of the Romans.</HEAD>
<P>ALL nations &s;eem willing to derive merit from the &s;plendor of their original, and where hi&s;tory is &s;ilent, they generally &s;upply the defect with fable. The Romans were particularly de|&s;irous of being thought de&s;cended from the gods, as if to hide the meanne&s;s of their real ance&s;try. Aeneas, the &s;on of Venus and Anchi|&s;es, having e&s;caped from the de&s;truction of <MILESTONE N="2284" UNIT="A. M."> Troy, after many adventures and dangers, ar|rived in Italy, where he was kindly received by
<PB N="2" REF="13">
Latinus, king of the Latins, who gave him his daughter Lavinia in marriage. Italy was then, as it is now, divided into a number of &s;mall &s;tates, independent of each other, and con&s;e|quently &s;ubject to frequent contentions among them&s;elves. Turnus, king of the Rutuli, was the fir&s;t who oppo&s;ed Aeneas, he having long made preten&s;ions to Lavinia him&s;elf. A war en&s;ued, in which the Trojan hero was victori|ous and Turnus &s;lain. In con&s;equence of this, Aeneas built a city, which was called Lavinium, in honour of his wife, and &s;ome time after, engaging in another war again&s;t Mezentius, one of the petty kings of the country, he was vanqui&s;hed in turn and died in battle, after a reign of four years. A&s;canius, his &s;on, &s;uc|ceeded to the kingdom, and to him, Silvius, a &s;econd &s;on, whom he had by Lavinia. It would be tedious and unintere&s;ting to recite a dry ca|talogue of the kings that followed, and of whom we know little more than the names, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion con|tinued for near four hundred years in the family, and that Numitor, the fifteenth from Aeneas, was the la&s;t king of Alba.</P>
<P>Numitor, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king|dom in con&s;equence of his father's will, had a brother named Amulius, to whom were left the trea&s;ures which had been brought from Troy. As riches but too generally prevail again&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="14">
right, Amulius made u&s;e of his wealth to &s;up|plant his brother, and &s;oon found means to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the kingdom. Not content with the crime of u&s;urpation, he added that of murder al&s;o. Numitor's &s;ons fir&s;t fell a &s;acrifice to his &s;u&s;picions, and to remove all aprehen&s;ions of being one day di&s;turbed in his ill got power, he cau&s;ed Rhea Silvia, his brother's only daughter, to become a ve&s;tal virgin, which of|fice obliging her to perpetual celibacy, made him le&s;s unea&s;y as to the claims of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>His precautions, however, were all fru&s;trated in the event; for Rhea Silvia going to fetch water from a neighbouring grove, was met and ravi&s;hed by a man, whom, perhaps to pal|liate her offence, &s;he averred to be Mars, the god of war. Whoever this lover of hers might have been, whether &s;ome per&s;on who deceived her by a&s;&s;uming &s;o great a name, or Amulius him&s;elf, as &s;ome writers are plea&s;ed to affirm, it matters not; certain it is, that in due time, &s;he was brought to bed of two boys, who were no &s;ooner born, than devoted, by the u&s;urper, to de&s;truction. The mother was condemned to be buried alive, the u&s;ual puni&s;hment for ve&s;|tals who had violated their cha&s;tity, and the twins were ordered to be flung into the river Tyber. It happened, however, at the time this rigorous &s;entence was put into execution, that the river had more than u&s;ually overflowed
<PB N="4" REF="15">
its banks, &s;o that the place where the children were thrown being at a di&s;tance from the main current, the water was too &s;hallow to drown them. In this &s;ituation, therefore, they conti|nued without harm, and that no part of their pre&s;ervation might want its wonders, we are told, that they were for &s;ome time &s;uckled there by a wolf, until Fau&s;tulus, the king's herd&s;man, finding them thus expo&s;ed, brought them home to Acca Laurentia, his wife, who brought them up as her own. Some, however, will have it, that the nur&s;e's name was Lupa, which gave ri&s;e to the &s;tory of their being nou|ri&s;hed by a wolf; but it is needle&s;s to weed out a &s;ingle improbability from accounts where the whole is overgrown with fable.</P>
<P>Romulus and Remus, the twins thus &s;trangely pre&s;erved, &s;eemed early to di&s;cover abilities and de&s;ires above the meanne&s;s of their &s;up|po&s;ed original. The &s;hepherds life began to di&s;|plea&s;e them, and from tending flocks, or hunt|ing wild bea&s;ts, they &s;oon turned their &s;trength again&s;t the robbers round the country, whom they often &s;tript of their plunder to &s;hare it among their fellow &s;hepherds.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e excur&s;ions it was that Remus was taken pri&s;oner by Numitor's herd&s;men, who brought him before the king, and accu&s;ed him of the very crime which he had &s;o often at|tempted to &s;uppre&s;s. Romulus, however, be|ing
<PB N="5" REF="16">
informed by Fau&s;tulus of his real birth, was not remi&s;s in a&s;&s;embling a number of his fellow &s;hepherds, in order to re&s;cue his brother from pri&s;on, and force the kingdom from the hands of the u&s;urper. Yet being too feeble to act openly, he directed his followers to a&s;&s;emble near the place by different ways, while Remus with equal vigilance gained upon the ci|tizens within. Amulius thus be&s;et on all &s;ides, and not knowing what expedient to think of for his &s;ecurity, was during his amazement and di&s;|traicton taken and &s;lain, while Numitor, who had been depo&s;ed forty-two years, recognized his grand&s;ons, and was once more re&s;tored to the throne.</P>
<P>Numitor being thus in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom, his grand&s;ons re&s;olved to build a city upon tho&s;e hills where they had formerly lived as &s;hepherds. The king had too many obligations to them not to approve their de|&s;ign, he appointed them lands, and gave per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch of his &s;ubjects as thought pro|per, to &s;ettle in their new colony. Many of the neighbouring &s;hepherds al&s;o, and &s;uch as were fond of change, repaired to the intended city, and prepared to rai&s;e it. For the more &s;peedy carrying on this work, the people were divided into two parts, each of which, it was &s;uppo&s;ed would indu&s;triou&s;ly emulate each other. But what was de&s;igned for an advantage,
<PB N="6" REF="17">
proved nearly fatal to this infant colony; it gave birth to two factions, one preferring Ro|mulus, the other Remus, who them&s;elves were not agreed upon the &s;pot where the city &s;hould &s;tand. To terminate this difference, they were recommended by the king, to take an omen from the flight of birds, and that he who&s;e omen &s;hould be mo&s;t favourable, &s;hould in all re&s;pects direct the other. In compliance with this advice, they both took their &s;tations upon different hills; to Remus appeared &s;ix vultures, to Romulus, twice that number, &s;o that each party thought it&s;elf victorious, the one having the fir&s;t omen, the other the mo&s;t numerous. This produced a conte&s;t which ended in a bat|tle wherein Remus was &s;lain, and it is even &s;aid, that he was killed by his brother, who be|ing provoked at his leaping contemptuou&s;ly over the city wall, &s;truck him dead upon the &s;pot, at the &s;ame time profe&s;&s;ing, that none &s;hould ever in&s;ult his walls with impunity.</P>
<P>Romulus being now &s;ole commander, and eighteen years of age, began the foundation of a city that was one day to give laws to the world. It was called Rome, after the name of <MILESTONE N="3252" UNIT="A. M."> the founder, and built upon the Palatine hill, <MILESTONE N="752" UNIT="A. C."> on which he had taken his &s;ucce&s;sful omen. The city was at fir&s;t almo&s;t &s;quare, containing about a thou&s;and hou&s;es. It was near a mile in compa&s;s, and commanded a &s;mall territory
<PB N="7" REF="18">
round it of about eight miles over. However, &s;mall as it appears, it was notwith&s;tanding, wor&s;e inhabited, and the fir&s;t method made u&s;e of to encrea&s;e its numbers, was the opening a &s;anctuary for all malefactors, &s;laves, and &s;uch as were de&s;irous of novelty. The&s;e came in great multitudes, and contributed to encrea&s;e the number of our legi&s;lator's new &s;ubjects. To have a ju&s;t idea therefore of Rome in its infant &s;tate, we have only to imagine a collection of cottages &s;urrounded by a feeble wall, rather built to &s;erve as a military retreat, than for the purpo&s;es of civil &s;ociety, rather filled with a tumultuous and vicious rabble, than with &s;ubjects bred to obedience and controll; we have only to conceive men bred to rapine, liv|ing in a place that merely &s;eemed calculated for the &s;ecurity of plunder; and yet to our a&s;toni&s;h|ment, we &s;hall &s;oon find this tumultuous con|cour&s;e uniting in the &s;tricte&s;t bonds of &s;ociety; this lawle&s;s rabble putting on the mo&s;t &s;incere regard for religion, and though compo&s;ed of the dregs of mankind, &s;etting examples to all the world of valour and of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. From the building of Rome to the death of Ro|mulus.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE was the city rai&s;ed above its foun|dation, when its rude inhabitants began to think of giving &s;ome form to their con&s;titution: their fir&s;t object was to unite liberty and em|pire; to form a kind of mixt monarchy, by which all power was to be divided between the prince and the people. Romulus, by an act of great genero&s;ity, left them at liberty to chu&s;e whom they would for their king, and they in gratitude, concurred to elect their founder: he was accordingly acknowledged as chief of their religion, &s;overeign magi&s;trate of Rome, and general of the army. Be&s;ide a guard to attend his per&s;on, it was agreed that he &s;hould be preceded wherever he went by twelve men, armed with axes tied up in a bundle of rods, who were to &s;erve as executioners of the law, and to impre&s;s his new &s;ubjects with an idea of his authority. Yet &s;till this authority was under very great re&s;trictions, as his whole power con&s;i&s;ted in calling the &s;enate together, in a&s;&s;embling the people, in conducting the army, when it was decreed by the other part of
<PB N="9" REF="20">
the con&s;titution, that they &s;hould go to war, and in appointing the que&s;tors or trea&s;urers of the public money, officers which we may &s;up|po&s;e, at that time had but very little employ|ment, as neither the &s;oldiers nor magi&s;trates received any pay.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, which was to act as coun&s;ellors to the king, was compo&s;ed of an hundred of the principal citizens of Rome, con&s;i&s;ting of men who&s;e age, wi&s;dom or valour, gave them a natural authority over their fellow &s;ubjects. The king named the fir&s;t &s;enator, and appointed him to the government of the city, when|ever war required the general's ab&s;ence. In this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly was tran&s;acted all the im|portant bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, the king him&s;elf pre&s;iding, altho' every que&s;tion was to be deter|mined by a majority of voices. As they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have a parental affection for the people, they were called fathers, and their de&s;cendants, patricians. To the patricians be|longed all the dignified offices of the &s;tate, as well as of the prie&s;thood. To the&s;e they were ap|pointed by the &s;enate and the people, while the lower ranks of citizens, who were thus excluded from all views of promotion for them&s;elves, were to expect advantages only from their valour in war, or their a&s;&s;iduity in agriculture.</P>
<P>The plebeians, who compo&s;ed the third part of the legi&s;lature, a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the
<PB N="10" REF="21">
power of authori&s;ing tho&s;e laws which were pa&s;s'd by the king or the &s;enate. All things relative to peace or war, to the election of magi&s;trates, and even to the chu&s;ing a king, were confirmed by their &s;uffrages. In their numerous a&s;&s;emblies all enterprizes again&s;t the enemy were pro|po&s;ed, while the &s;enate had only a power of rejecting or approving their de&s;igns. Thus was the &s;tate compo&s;ed of three orders, each a check upon the other; the people re&s;olved whether the propo&s;als of the king were plea&s;ing to them, the &s;enate deliberated upon the expediency of the mea&s;ure, and the king gave vigour and &s;pirit by directing the execution. But though the people by the&s;e regulations &s;eemed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great power, yet there was one circum&s;tance which contributed greatly to its diminution, namely, the rights of patronage, which were lodged in the &s;enate. The king, &s;en&s;ible that in every &s;tate there mu&s;t be a dependance of the poor upon the powerful, gave permi&s;&s;ion to every plebeian to chu&s;e one among the &s;enators for a patron. The bond between them was of the &s;tronge&s;t kind; the patron was to give protec|tion to his client, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his advice and fortune, to plead for him before the judge, and to re&s;cue him from every oppre&s;&s;ion. On the other hand, the client attached him&s;elf to the intere&s;ts of his patron, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, if poor, to portion his daughters, to pay his debts, or
<PB N="11" REF="22">
his ran&s;om, in ca&s;e of being taken pri&s;oner. He was to follow him on every &s;ervice of danger; whenever he &s;tood candidate for an office, he was obliged to give him his &s;uffrage, and was prohibited from giving te&s;timony in a court of ju&s;tice, whenever his evidence affected the intere&s;ts of his patron. The&s;e reciprocal duties were held &s;o &s;acred, that any who vio|lated them were ever after held infamous, and excluded from all the protection of the laws: &s;o that from hence we &s;ee the &s;enate in effect po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;uffrages of their clients, &s;ince all that was left the people was only the power of chu&s;ing what patron they &s;hould obey. Among a nation &s;o barbarous and fierce as the fir&s;t Romans, it was wi&s;e to enforce obedience, as the mo&s;t requi&s;ite duty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of the new-created king was to attend to the intere&s;ts of religion, and to endea|vour to humanize his &s;ubjects, by the notion of other rewards and puni&s;hments than tho&s;e of human law. The preci&s;e form of their wor&s;hip is unknown; but the greate&s;t part of the reli|gion of that age con&s;i&s;ted in a firm reliance upon the credit of their &s;oothfayers, who pre|tended, from ob&s;ervations on the flight of birds and the entrails of bea&s;ts, to direct the pre&s;ent, and to dive into futurity. This pious fraud, which fir&s;t aro&s;e from ignorance, &s;oon became a mo&s;t u&s;eful machine in the hands of
<PB N="12" REF="23">
government. Romulus, by an expre&s;s law, com|manded, that no election &s;hould be made, no enterprize undertaken, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting the &s;ooth&s;ayers. With equal wi&s;dom he ordained, that no new divinities &s;hould be introduced into public wor&s;hip, that the prie&s;thood &s;hould continue for life, and that none &s;hould be eleccted into it before the age of fifty. He forbad them to mix fable with the my&s;teries of their religion; and that they &s;hould be qualified to teach others, he ordered that they &s;hould be the the hi&s;toriographers of the times; &s;o that while in&s;tructed by prie&s;ts like the&s;e, the people could never degenerate into total barbarity.</P>
<P>Of his other laws we have but few fragments remaining. In the&s;e however we learn, that wives were forbid, upon any pretext what&s;o|ever, to &s;eparate from their hu&s;bands; while, on the contrary, the hu&s;band was empowered to repudiate the wife, and even to put her to death with the con&s;ent of her relations, in ea&s;e &s;he was detected in adultery, in attempting to poi|&s;on, in making fal&s;e keys, or even of having drank too much wine. His laws between chil|dren and their parents were yet &s;till more &s;evere: the father had entire power over his offspring, both of fortune and life, he could &s;ell them or impri&s;on them at any time of their lives, or in any &s;tations to which they were arrived. The father might expo&s;e his children, if born
<PB N="13" REF="24">
with any deformities, having previou&s;ly commu|nicated his intentions to his five next of kin|dred. Our lawgiver &s;eemed more kind even to his enemies, for his &s;ubjects were prohibited from killing them after they had &s;urrendered, or even from &s;elling them: his ambition only aimed at dimini&s;hing the number of his ene|mies by making friends of them.</P>
<P>After &s;o many endeavours to encrea&s;e his &s;ubjects, and &s;o many laws to regulate them, he next gave orders to a&s;certain their numbers. The whole amounted but to three thou&s;and foot, and about as many hundred hor&s;emen, capable of bearing arms. The&s;e therefore were divided equally into three tribes, and to each he a&s;&s;igned a different part of the city. Each of the&s;e tribes were &s;ubdivided into ten curiae or companies, con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred men each, with a centurion to command it, a prie&s;t called curio to perform the &s;acrifices, and two of the principal inhabitants, called duumviri, to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice. According to the number of curiae he divided the lands into thirty parts, re&s;erving one portion for public u&s;es, and an|other for religious ceremonies. The &s;implicity and frugality of the times will be be&s;t under|&s;tood by ob&s;erving, that each citizen had not above two acres of ground for his own &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance. Of the hor&s;emen mentioned above, tho&s;e were cho&s;en ten from each curia; they
<PB N="14" REF="25">
were particularly appointed to fight round the per&s;on of the king; of them his guard was compo&s;ed, and from their alacrity in battle, or from the name of their fir&s;t commander, they were called celeres, a word equivalent to our light hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>A government thus wi&s;ely in&s;tituted, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, induced numbers to come and live under it; each day added to its &s;trength, multitudes flock'd in from all the adjacent towns, and it only &s;eemed to want women to a&s;certain its duration. In this exigence, Romu|lus, by the advice of the &s;enate, &s;ent deputies among the Sabines, his neighbours, entreating their alliance, and upon the&s;e terms offering to cement the mo&s;t &s;trict confederacy with them. The Sabines, who were then con&s;idered as the mo&s;t warlike people of Italy, rejected the pro|po&s;ition with di&s;dain, and &s;ome even added raillery to the refu&s;al, demanding, that as he had opened a &s;anctuary for fugitive &s;laves, why he had not al&s;o opened another for pro&s;titute women. This an&s;wer quickly rai&s;ed the indig|nation of the Romans; and the king, in order to gratify their re&s;entment, while he at the &s;ame time &s;hould people his city, re&s;olved to obtain by force, what was denied to entreaty. For this purpo&s;e he proclaimed a fea&s;t, in ho|nour of Neptune, throughout all the neigh|bouring villages, and made the mo&s;t magnifi|cent
<PB N="15" REF="26">
preparations for it. The&s;e fea&s;ts were generally preceded by &s;acrifices, and ended in &s;hews of wre&s;tlers, gladiators, and chariot|cour&s;es. The Sabines, as he had expected, were among the foremo&s;t who came to be &s;pec|tators, bringing their wives and daughters with them to &s;hare the plea&s;ure of the &s;ight. The inhabitants al&s;o of many of the neighbouring towns came, who were received by the Romans with marks of the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality. In the mean time the games began, and while the &s;trangers were mo&s;t intent upon the &s;pectacle, a number of the Roman youth ru&s;hed in among them with drawn &s;words, &s;eized the younge&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful women, and car|ried them off by violence. In vain the parents prote&s;ted again&s;t this breach of ho&s;pitality; in vain the virgins them&s;elves at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed the attempts of their ravi&s;hers; per&s;everance and care&s;&s;es obtained tho&s;e favours which timi|dity at fir&s;t denied; &s;o that the betrayers, from being objects of aver&s;ion, &s;oon became partners of their deare&s;t affections.</P>
<P>But however the affront might have been borne by them, it was not &s;o ea&s;ily put up by their parents; a bloody war en&s;ued. The cities of Cenina, Antemna and Cru&s;tumium were the fir&s;t who re&s;olved to revenge the common cau&s;e, which the Sabines &s;eemed too dilatory in pur&s;uing. The&s;e, by making &s;eperate inroads,
<PB N="16" REF="27">
became a more ea&s;y conque&s;t to Romulus, who fir&s;t overthrew the Ceninen&s;es, &s;lew their king Acron in &s;ingle combat, and made an offering of the royal &s;poils to Jupiter Feretrius, on the &s;pot where the capitol was afterwards built. The Antemnates and Cru&s;tuminians &s;hared the &s;ame fate, their armies were overthrown, and their cities taken. The conqueror however made the mo&s;t merciful u&s;e of his victory; for in&s;tead of de&s;troying their towns, or le&s;&s;ening their numbers, he only placed colonies of Ro|mans in them, to &s;erve as a frontier to repre&s;s more di&s;tant inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>Tatius, king of Cures, a Sabine city, was the la&s;t, although the mo&s;t formidable, who undertook to revenge the di&s;grace his country had &s;uffered. He entered the Roman territo|ries at the head of twenty-five thou&s;and men, and not content with a &s;uperiority of forces, he added &s;tratagem al&s;o. Tarpeia, who was daughter to the commander of the Capitoline hill, happened to fall into his hands, as &s;he went without the walls of the city to fetch water. Upon her he prevailed, by means of large pro|mi&s;es, to betray one of the gates to his army. The reward &s;he engaged for, was what the &s;ol|diers wore on their arms, by which &s;he meant their bracelets. They however either mi&s;taking her meaning, or willing to puni&s;h her perfidy, threw their bucklers upon her as they entered,
<PB N="17" REF="28">
and cru&s;hed her to death beneath them. The Sabines being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Capitoline, had the advantage of continuing the war at their plea&s;ure, and for &s;ome time only &s;light encounters pa&s;&s;ed between them. At length however, the tediou&s;ne&s;s of this conte&s;t began to weary out both parties, &s;o that each wi&s;hed, out neither would &s;toop to &s;ue for peace. The de&s;ire of peace often gives vigour to mea&s;ures in war; wherefore both &s;ides re&s;olving to termi|nate their doubts by a deci&s;ive action, a gene|ral engagement en&s;ued, which was renewed for &s;everal days, with almo&s;t equal &s;ucce&s;s. They both fought for all that was valuable in life, and neither could think of &s;ubmitting: it was in the valley between the Capitoline and Quirinal hills, that the la&s;t engagement was fought between the Romans and the Sabines. The engagement became general, and the &s;laughter prodigious, when the attention of both &s;ides was &s;uddenly turned from the &s;cene of horror before them, to another infinitely more &s;triking. The Sabine women who had been carried off by the Romans, were &s;een with their hair loo&s;e and their ornaments ne|glected, flying in between the combatants, re|gardle&s;s of their own danger, and with loud outcries only &s;olicitous for that of their pa|rents, their hu&s;bands and their children. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If", cried they, "you are re&s;olved upon &s;laughter,
<PB N="18" REF="29">
turn your arms upon us, &s;ince we only are the cau&s;e of your animo&s;ity. If any mu&s;t die, let it be us, &s;ince, if our parents or our hu&s;bands fall, we mu&s;t be equally mi|&s;erable in being the &s;urviving cau&s;e."</Q> A &s;pectacle &s;o moving could not be re&s;i&s;ted by the combatants, both &s;ides for a while, as if by mutual impul&s;e, let fall their weapons, and beheld the di&s;tre&s;s in &s;ilent amazement. The tears and entreaties of their wives and daugh|ters at length prevailed, an accommodation en&s;ued, by which it was agreed; that Romulus and Tatius &s;hould reign jointly in Rome, with equal power and prerogative, that an hundred Sabines &s;hould be admitted into the &s;enate, that the city &s;hould &s;till retain its former name, but that the citizens &s;hould be called Quirites, after Cures, the principal town of the Sabines, and that both nations being thus united, &s;uch of the Sabines as cho&s;e it, &s;hould be admitted to live in and enjoy all the privileges of citi|zens in Rome. Thus every &s;torm which &s;eem|ed to threaten this growing empire, only &s;erv|ed to encrea&s;e its vigour. That army, which in the morning had re&s;olved upon its de&s;truc|tion, came in the evening with joy to be en|rolled among the number of its citizens. Romu|lus &s;aw his dominions and his &s;ubjects encrea&s;|ed by more than half, in the &s;pace of a few hours; and, as if fortune meant every way to
<PB N="19" REF="30">
a&s;&s;i&s;t his greatne&s;s, Tatius, his partner in the government, was killed about five years after by the Lavinians, for having protected &s;ome &s;ervants of his, who had plundered them and &s;lain their amba&s;&s;adors; &s;o that by this acci|dent Romulus once more &s;aw him&s;elf &s;ole mo|narch of Rome.</P>
<P>Rome being greatly &s;trengthened by this new acqui&s;ition of power, began to grow for|midable to her neighbours, and it may be &s;up|po&s;ed, that pretexts for war were not wanting, when prompted by jealou&s;y on their &s;ide, and by ambition on that of the Romans. Fidena and Cameria, two neighbouring cities, were &s;ubdued and taken. Veii al&s;o, one of the mo&s;t powerful &s;tates of Etruria, &s;hared nearly the &s;ame fate, after two fierce engagements they &s;ued for peace and a league, which was granted up|on giving up a &s;eventh part of their domi|nions, their &s;alt-pits near the river, and ho&s;tages for greater &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Succe&s;&s;es like the&s;e produced an equal &s;hare of pride in the conqueror. From being cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt|ed with tho&s;e limits which had been wi&s;ely fixed to his power, he began to affect ab&s;olute &s;way, and to govern tho&s;e laws, to which he had him|&s;elf formerly profe&s;&s;ed implicit obedience. The &s;enate was particularly di&s;plea&s;ed at his conduct, finding them&s;elves only u&s;ed as in&s;truments to ratify the rigour of his commands. We are
<PB N="20" REF="31">
not told the preci&s;e manner which they made u&s;e of to get rid of the tyrant; &s;ome &s;ay that he was torn in pieces in the &s;enate-hou&s;e; others, that he di&s;appeared while reviewing his army; certain it is, that from the &s;ecrecy of the fact, and the concealment of the body, they took occa&s;ion to per&s;uade the multitude, that he was taken up into heaven: thus him whom they could not bear as a king, they were contented to wor&s;hip as a god.</P>
<P>Romulus reigned thirty-&s;even years, and af|ter his death, had a temple built to him, under the name of Quirinus, one of the &s;enators &s;o|lemnly affirming, that he had appeared to him, and de&s;ired to be invoked by that title. We &s;ee little more in the character of this prince, than what might be expected in &s;uch an age, great temperance and great valour, which ge|nerally make up the catalogue of &s;avage vir|tues. However the grandeur of an empire ad|mired by the whole world, creates in us an ad|miration of the founder, without much ex|amining his title.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. From the death of Romulus to the death of Numa Pompilius, the &s;econd king of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>ROME was already grown from its &s;mall <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="U. C."> beginnings into a very formidable &s;tate, her forces now amounted to forty-&s;ix thou&s;and foot and a thou&s;and hor&s;e. The kingdom of Alba al&s;o fell in by the death of Numitor, &s;o that it now required &s;ome time to unite &s;o great a concour&s;e of new-made &s;ubjects into an obedi|ence to one governor: in fact, the city &s;eemed greatly divided in the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The Sabines were for having the king cho&s;en from their body, but the Romans could not bear the thoughts of advancing a &s;tranger to the throne. In this perplexity the &s;enate un|dertook to &s;upply the place of the king, by taking the government, each of them in turn, for five days, and during that time, enjoying all the honours and all the privileges of royalty. This new form of government held a year, nor is it known whether the &s;enate intended by continuing it, to pre&s;erve the &s;overeign power among them&s;elves, or only to wait for a proper object of their choice, on whom to devolve the regal power. The plebeians, however, who &s;aw
<PB N="22" REF="33">
that this method of transferring power was only multiplying their ma&s;ters, in&s;i&s;ted upon al|tering that mode of government, allowing the &s;enate a choice, either of nominating a king, or electing annual magi&s;trates from among their number. The &s;enate being thus driven to an election, for &s;ome time debated upon the proper form, till at length it was agreed, that the party which elected, &s;hould nominate from the body of the other, &s;o that the new king would have equal attachments to both; to the one as his countrymen, to the other as his electors. In con&s;equence of this the choice being left to the Roman part of the &s;enate, they pitched upon Numa Pompilius, a Sabine, and their choice was received with univer&s;al approbation by the re&s;t of the &s;enate and the people.</P>
<P>Numa Pompilius, who was now about forty, had long been eminent for his piety, his ju&s;|tice, moderation and exemplary life. He was &s;killed in all the learning and philo&s;ophy of the Sabines, and lived at home at Cures, con|tented with a private fortune, unambitious of higher honours. It was not therefore without reluctance that he accepted the dignity that was conferred upon him, he for &s;ome time continued ob&s;tinately to refu&s;e it, but at length, at the reque&s;t of his father, and the per&s;ua&s;ions of the amba&s;&s;adors who were &s;ent
<PB N="23" REF="34">
to him from Rome, he con&s;ented to accept of the kingdom, &s;o that his acceptance produced &s;uch joy, that the people &s;eemed not &s;o much to receive a king as a kingdom.</P>
<P>The Romans were fond of thinking that providence indu&s;triou&s;ly adapted the various di&s;po&s;itions of its kings to the different ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the people, and indeed in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance they were not much mi&s;taken. No monarch could be more proper for them than Numa, at a conjuncture when the go|vernment was compo&s;ed of various petty &s;tates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ately &s;ubdued, and but ill united among each other; they wanted a ma&s;ter who could by his laws and precepts &s;often their fierce di&s;po&s;i|tions, and by his example induce them to a love of religion, and every milder virtue. Under Numa therefore, the people became more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and &s;ocial, but what gave them &s;till greater force, if con&s;idered in the light of conquerors, was the &s;pirit of reli|gion, which he implanted among&s;t them. This continued to operate through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, for what could re&s;i&s;t the greate&s;t valour, when impelled by the mo&s;t profound &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>In the reign of Numa therfore, we are to look only for the pacific virtues, as his whole time was &s;pent in in&s;piring his &s;ubjects with a love of piety, and a veneration for the gods.
<PB N="24" REF="35">
He built many new temples, he in&s;tituted fea&s;ts, and the &s;anctity of his life gave him credit enough to per&s;uade his people, that he had a particular corre&s;pondence with the god|de&s;s Egeria. By her advice he built the temple of Janus, which was to be &s;hut in time of peace, and open in war; he ordained ve&s;tal virgins, who being four in number, had very great privileges allowed them, &s;uch as of being preceded by the fa&s;ces or en&s;igns of royal power, and of pardoning malefactors in ca&s;e of an accidental meeting: he in&s;tituted pon|tiffs, and enrolled him&s;elf among the number: he brought up the orders of the Salian and Fecial prie&s;thood, the one to pre&s;erve the &s;a|cred &s;hields called ancillia, which he pretended had dropt down from heaven, and which, while remaining in Rome, the city could never be taken; the other to judge of the equity of war, and to proclaim it with great ceremony.</P>
<P>For the encouragement of agriculture, he divided tho&s;e lands which Romulus had gained in war, among the poorer part of the people; he abated the rigour of the laws, which his predece&s;&s;or had in&s;tituted, with regard to pa|rents and children, making it unlawful for a father to &s;ell his &s;on after marriage, becau&s;e he thought it unju&s;t, that a woman who had mar|ried a freeman, &s;hould be con&s;trained to live with a &s;lave: he regulated al&s;o the kalendar,
<PB N="25" REF="36">
and aboli&s;hed the di&s;tinction between Romans and Sabines, by dividing the people according to their &s;everal trades, and compelling them to live together. Thus having lived to the age of more than four&s;core years, and having reigned forty-three in profound peace, he died, ordering his body to be buried in a &s;tone coffin, contrary to the cu&s;tom of the times, and his books of ceremonies, which con&s;i&s;ted of twelve in Latin and as many in Greek, to be buried by his &s;ide, in another. The&s;e were taken up about four hundred years after, and becau&s;e it was thought impious to communicate the my&s;|teries they contained to the public, they were burnt by order of the &s;enate, which perhaps was willing to hide the futility of the work by this extraordinary reverence for the contents.</P>

<P>UPON the death of Numa, the government <MILESTONE N="82" UNIT="U. C."> once more devolved upon the &s;enate, and con|tinued with them till the people elected Tullus Ho&s;tilius for their king, which choice had al&s;o the concurrence of the other part of the con|&s;titution. This monarch, who was grand&s;on
<PB N="26" REF="37">
to a noble Roman, who had formerly &s;ignalized him&s;elf again&s;t the Sabines, was every way un|like his predece&s;&s;or, being entirely devoted to war, and more fond of enterprize, than even the founder of the empire him&s;elf had been; &s;o that he only &s;ought a pretext for leading his forces to the field.</P>
<P>The Albans were the fir&s;t people who gave him an opportunity of indulging his favourite inclinations. Two neighbouring &s;tates, both eager for war, and both in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting by plunder, can never want a pretext to colour the violence of a fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;ion. A few Roman &s;hepherds had, it &s;eems, commit|ted an inroad upon the territories of Alba; a number of Alban &s;hepherds had made repri&s;als upon them; amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent from either &s;tate, complaining of the injury; no redre&s;s was given, and a formal war was declared on both &s;ides, which neither however would bear the blame of having fir&s;t given ri&s;e to. There were indeed many rea&s;ons for making the&s;e two &s;tates unwilling to come to an open rupture; they were de&s;cended from the &s;ame original, and the ties of con&s;anguinity &s;till held many of them united. There were al&s;o &s;ome neighbouring &s;tates, enemies to both, that only &s;ought an opportunity of falling upon either. It was with the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, that after &s;ome warlike &s;tratagems on either &s;ide, the Roman
<PB N="27" REF="38">
and Alban forces met, about five miles from Rome, prepared to decide the fate of their re|&s;pective kingdoms, for almo&s;t every battle in the&s;e barbarous times was deci&s;ive. The two armies were for &s;ome time drawn out in array, awaiting the &s;ignal to begin, both chiding the length of that dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e which kept them from death or victory. But an unex|pected propo&s;al from the Alban general put a &s;top to the on&s;et, for &s;tepping in between both armies, he offered the Romans the choice of de|ciding the di&s;pute by &s;ingle combat; adding, that the &s;ide who&s;e champion was overcome, &s;hould &s;ubmit to the conqueror. A propo&s;al like this &s;uited the impetuous temper of the Roman king, and was embraced with joy by his &s;ubjects, each of which hoped, that he him&s;elf &s;hould be cho&s;en to fight the cau&s;e of his country. Many valiant men offered them|&s;elves, but could not be accepted to the exclu|&s;ion of others, till, at la&s;t, in this incertitude of choice, chance &s;ugge&s;ted a remedy. There were at that time three twin brothers in each army, tho&s;e of the Romans were called Horatii, and the&s;e of the Albans Curiatii, all &s;ix re|markable for their courage, &s;trength and acti|vity, and to the&s;e it was re&s;olved to commit the management of the combat. When the previous ceremony of oaths and prote&s;tations, binding the army of the vanqui&s;hed party to
<PB N="28" REF="39">
&s;ubmit to that of the victorious were over, the combatants were led forth amid&s;t the encou|ragements, the prayers, and the &s;houts of their country. They were warned of the greatne&s;s of the cau&s;e; they were reminded of their former atchievments; they were admoni&s;hed, that their fathers, their countrymen, and gods were &s;pectators of their behaviour. At length, warm'd with the importance of the trial, the champions on each &s;ide met in combat together, and totally regardle&s;s of his own &s;afety, each only &s;ought the de&s;truction of his opponent. The &s;pectators, in horrid &s;ilence, trembled at every blow, and wi&s;hed to &s;hare the danger, till at length fortune &s;eemed to decide the glory of the field. Victory, that had hitherto been doubtful, appeared to declare again&s;t the Romans; they beheld two of their champions lying dead upon the plain, and the three Curiatii, who were wounded, &s;lowly en|deavouring to pur&s;ue the &s;urvivor, who &s;eemed by flight to beg for mercy. At this, the Alban army, unable to &s;uppre&s;s their joy, rai&s;ed a loud acclamation, while the Romans inwardly cur&s;ed and repined at the cowardice of him whom they &s;aw in circum&s;tances of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s. Soon however they began to alter their &s;entiments, when they perceived that his flight was only pretended, in order to &s;eparate his antagoni&s;ts whom he was unable to oppo&s;e united; for
<PB N="29" REF="40">
quickly after &s;topping his cour&s;e, and turning upon him who followed mo&s;t clo&s;ely behind, he laid him dead at his feet: the &s;econd bro|ther, who came on to a&s;&s;i&s;t him who was fallen, only &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and now there re|mained but the la&s;t Curiatius to conquer, who, fatigued and quite di&s;abled with his wounds, &s;lowly came up to offer an ea&s;y victory. He was killed, almo&s;t unre&s;i&s;ting, while the conqueror exclaiming, offered him as a victim to the &s;uperiority of the Romans, whom now the Alban army con&s;ented to obey.</P>
<P>A victory &s;o great, and attended with &s;uch &s;ignal effects de&s;erved every honour that Rome could be&s;tow; but as if none of the virtues of that age were to be without alloy, the very hand that in the morning was exerted to &s;ave his country, was before night embrued in the blood of a &s;i&s;ter. For returning triumphant from the field, it rai&s;ed his indignation to be|hold her bathed in tears, and lamenting the lo&s;s of her lover, one of the Curiatii, to whom &s;he was betrothed. But when, upon &s;eeing the ve&s;t which &s;he had made for her lover, among the number of his &s;poils, and beginning to up|braid him, it provoked him beyond the power of &s;ufferance, &s;o that he &s;lew her in a rage. This action greatly di&s;plea&s;ed the &s;enate, and drew on the condemnation of the magi&s;trates, but he
<PB N="30" REF="41">
was pardoned by making his appeal to the people.</P>
<P>Things being in this po&s;ture, Ho&s;tilius re|&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of the late victory, by confirming the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Alba, and taking the proper &s;teps to quell the in&s;olence of the inhabitants of Fidena and Veii, who had been making preparations to &s;hake off their &s;ubjec|tion. His de&s;igns were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in both. A victory over the latter, re&s;trained their attempts for &s;ome time; and as to the former, having convicted Metius Suffetius, their general, of trea&s;on, he cau&s;ed him to be torn to pieces by hor&s;es; and &s;till more, to give no ground for future revolts, he utterly demoli&s;hed the city of Alba, and tran&s;planted the inhabitants to Rome, many of whom he admitted into the &s;enate.</P>
<P>After the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he turned his arms again&s;t the Sabines, over whom he gained a &s;ignal victory by means of his cavalry, whom the enemy were incapable of with&s;tanding. Thus every new war, which depopulates other &s;tates, &s;eemed but to add &s;trength and numbers to that of Rome. It was perhaps from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that a &s;tate of war was the be&s;t for his people, that the king entered into one with the Latins, which however was managed but &s;lowly on both &s;ides, no battle being fought, nor no town taken except Medallia, which had for|merly
<PB N="31" REF="42">
been obliged to accept a Roman colony, and was now permitted to be plundered, as an example to prevent the like defection in others. This war la&s;ted almo&s;t the re&s;t of this reign, the latter part of which was clouded with terrors from pretended prodigies, while, at the &s;ame time, the king &s;aw his people afflicted with a real famine, which it was not in his power to relieve. He died, after a reign of thirty-two years, &s;ome &s;ay by lightening, with his whole family, others, with more probability, by trea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. From the death of Tullus Ho&s;tilius to the death of Ancus Martius, the fourth king of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER an interregnum, as in the former ca&s;e, <MILESTONE N="115" UNIT="U. C."> Ancus Martius, the grand&s;on of Numa, was was elected king by the people, and the choice afterwards was confirmed by the &s;enate. As this monarch was a lineal de&s;cendant from Numa, &s;o he &s;eemed to make him the great object of his imitation. Indeed he was by nature incapable of making any great figure in war, as he took his name of Ancus, from the crookedne&s;s of one of his arms, which he was incapable of extending: however he made up this defect by the mo&s;t diligent application to
<PB N="32" REF="43">
all the arts of peace. He in&s;tituted the &s;acred ceremonies which were to precede a declaration of war; he endeavoured to per&s;uade the people, that the calamities which lately befel them and his predece&s;&s;or, were owing to a neglect of the gods; he took every occa&s;ion to advi&s;e his &s;ub|jects to return to the arts of agriculture, and lay a&s;ide the le&s;s u&s;eful &s;tratagems of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;titutions and precepts were con&s;i|dered by the neighbouring powers rather as marks of cowardice than of wi&s;dom. The Latins therefore began to make incur&s;ions upon his territories, and by their outrages, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, forced him into a war. In this how|ever he &s;till kept up to his character, and pre|viou&s;ly &s;ent an herald, who, in a peculiar dre&s;s, and with a javelin headed with iron in his hand, went to the confines of the enemy, &s;olemnly proclaimed war, and then flung his weapon into their territories, with all the force he was able. The &s;ucce&s;s of this war was equal to its ju&s;tice; Ancus conquered the Latins, de&s;troyed their cities, removed their inhabitants to Rome, and encrea&s;ed its territories by the addition of part of theirs. He quelled al&s;o an in&s;urrection of the Veii, the Fidenates, and the Vol&s;cii, and over the Sabines he obtained a &s;econd triumph.</P>
<P>But his victories over the enemy were by no means comparable to his works at home, in rai&s;ing temples, fortifying the city, making a
<PB N="33" REF="44">
pri&s;on for malefactors, and building a &s;ea-port at the mouth of the Tyber, called O&s;tia, by which he &s;ecured to his &s;ubjects the trade of that river, and that of the &s;alt-pits adjacent. Nor was he le&s;s careful in encouraging &s;trangers to come and &s;ettle with him: the privileges which they obtained, and the ju&s;tice which was admini&s;tered by him to all, brought numbers of the mo&s;t creditable per&s;ons from different parts of Italy, who not only encrea&s;ed the riches of his &s;ubjects, but al&s;o tended &s;till more to civilize them. Among others of this quality was Lucumon, who afterwards took the name of Lucius, and became his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the king|dom, by the name of Lucius Tarquinius. This &s;tranger, who was a per&s;on of great accompli&s;h|ments as well as of large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, was very honourably treated by Ancus, who probably was the more prejudiced in his favour, by an offer Tarquinius had made him of all his for|tune for public u&s;es. He was accordingly elected into the &s;enate, and appointed guardian to the two &s;ons of Ancus, who, having en|riched his &s;ubjects and beautified the city, died, after reigning twenty-four years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. From the death of Ancus Martius to the death of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, the fifth king of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="138" UNIT="U. C."> LUcius Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, who&s;e original name, as has been already ob&s;erved, was Lu|cumon, and who was appointed guardian to the &s;ons of the late king, took the &s;urname of Tarquinius, from the city Tarquinia, from whence he la&s;t came. His father was a mer|chant of Corinth, who acquired con&s;iderable wealth by trade, and had &s;ettled in Italy upon account of &s;ome troubles at home. His &s;on Lucumon, who inherited his fortune, married a woman of family in the city of Tarquinia, and as his birth, profe&s;&s;ion and country were contemptible to the nobles of the place, by his wife's per&s;ua&s;ions, he came to &s;ettle at Rome, where merit only made di&s;tinction. On his way thither, &s;ay the hi&s;torians, as he approached the city gate, an eagle, &s;tooping from above, took off his hat, and flying round his chariot for &s;ome time, with much noi&s;e, put it on again. This, his wife Tanaquil, who it &s;eems was &s;killed in augury, interpreted as a pre&s;age, that he &s;hould one day wear the crown, and per|haps
<PB N="35" REF="46">
it was this which fir&s;t fired his ambition to pur&s;ue it: accordingly, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great riches, all his actions and expences &s;eemed to aim at popularity. His kind addre&s;s, his frequent invitations, and his many benefits, gained the e&s;teem and admiration of a &s;imple people, who were yet un&s;killed in the arts of intrigue, and never con&s;idered the views with which tho&s;e favours were be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Ancus being dead, and the kingdom, as u&s;ual, devolving upon the &s;enate, Tarquin u&s;ed all his power and arts to &s;et a&s;ide the children of the late king, and to get him&s;elf elected in their &s;tead. In order to this, upon the day ap|pointed for election, he contrived to have them &s;ent out of the city, and in a &s;et &s;peech to the people, in which he urged his friend&s;hip for them, the fortune he had &s;pent among them, and his knowledge of their government, he of|fered him&s;elf for their king. As there was nothing in this harangue that could be con|te&s;ted, it had the de&s;ired effect, and the people with one con&s;ent, elected him as their &s;ove|reign.</P>
<P>A kingdom thus got by intrigue, was not|with&s;tanding governed with equity. In the beginning of his reign, in order to recompence his friends, he added an hundred members more to the &s;enate, which made them, in all, three hundred. He likewi&s;e encrea&s;ed the
<PB N="36" REF="47">
number of ve&s;tal virgins from four to &s;even, and laid the fir&s;t foundations of an amphi|theatre for the combats of men and bea&s;ts, which were afterwards carried to an horrid exce&s;s. The fir&s;t &s;hews however, were only hor&s;e|racing and boxing, in which, men hired for that purpo&s;e from Etruria, fought with gauntlets for a prize: how different the&s;e from the com|bats of a latter age, in which two thou&s;and gladiators were &s;een at once expiring or dead upon the &s;tage!</P>
<P>His peaceful &s;tudies however, were &s;oon in|terrupted by the inroads of his re&s;tle&s;s neigh|bours, particularly the Latins, over whom he triumphed, and whom he forced to beg a peace. He then turned his arms again&s;t the Sabines, who had once more ri&s;en up again&s;t Rome, and had pa&s;t over the river Tyber, upon a bridge, in order to plunder the Roman territo|ries, and if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ack the city. Tarquin however, &s;oon came up to them on the banks of the river, and gave directions to &s;et fire to a large heap of wood that lay by its &s;ide, and then to throw it in; the burning wood floating down the &s;tream, &s;et fire to the enemies bridge, and intercepted their retreat. Nor did he per|mit them to take mea&s;ures for oppo&s;ing him, but attacking them with vigour, routed their army, &s;o that many who e&s;caped the &s;word, were drowned in attempting to cro&s;s over, while
<PB N="37" REF="48">
their bodies and armour floating down to Rome, brought news of the victory, even be|fore the me&s;&s;engers could arrive.</P>
<P>Tarquin re&s;olving not to give them time to recover from this defeat, followed them into their own country, where by another victory he obliged them to &s;ue for peace, which how|ever they did not obtain, but at the expence of a con&s;iderable part of their territories, and of Collatia, a large city, five miles ea&s;t of Rome. The&s;e conque&s;ts were followed by &s;e|veral advantages over the Latins, from whom he took many towns, though without gaining any deci&s;ive victory.</P>
<P>Tarquin having thus forced his enemies into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was re&s;olved not to let his &s;ubjects corrupt in indolence, but undertook &s;everal public works for the convenience and embel|li&s;hment of the city. He &s;urrounded it with &s;tronger and larger walls; he adorned the forum or market-place with porticoes; he made many &s;ewers to drain the city, &s;ome of which excite the admiration of travellers to this very day. He improved the amphitheatre which his predece&s;&s;or had begun, and laid the foundation of the capitol, which however he did not live to fini&s;h.</P>
<P>In his time al&s;o, the augurs came into a great encrea&s;e of reputation, and he found it
<PB N="38" REF="49">
his intere&s;t to promote the &s;uper&s;tition of the people, as this was in fact but to encrea&s;e their obedience. Tanaquil his wife was a great pretender to this art, but Accius Naevius was the mo&s;t celebrated adept of the kind, that was ever known in Rome. Upon a certain occa|&s;ion, Tarquin being &s;en&s;ible of his want of ca|valry, had &s;ome intentions of adding three new companies of knights to tho&s;e three that had been formerly in&s;tituted by Romulus, but he was re&s;trained by the augur, who declared, that it was forbidden by the gods, to alter any of the in&s;titutions of their founder. The king, as the hi&s;torians &s;ay, being in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, upon this re&s;olved to try the augur's &s;kill, and a&s;ked him, whether what he was then pondering in his mind could be effected. Naevius having examined his auguries, boldly affirmed that it might: why then, cries the king, with an in|&s;ulting &s;mile, I had thoughts of cutting this whet&s;tone with a razor. Cut boldly, replied the augur; and the king cut it through ac|cordingly. Thence forward nothing was under|taken in Rome without con&s;ulting the augurs, and obtaining their advice and approbation. No a&s;&s;embly was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, nor army levied; no battle fought, nor peace re&s;tored, without con&s;ulting the chirping and the flight of birds, which, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, the augurs made to &s;peak whatever language they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="50">
Tarquin was not content with a kingdom, without al&s;o the en&s;igns of royalty; in imita|tion of the Lydian kings, he a&s;&s;umed a crown of gold, an ivory throne, a &s;ceptre with an eagle on the top, and robes of purple. It was perhaps the &s;plendor of the&s;e royalties that fir&s;t rai&s;ed the envy of the late king's &s;ons, who had now for above thirty-&s;even years quietly &s;ubmitted to his government. His de&s;ign al&s;o of adopting Servius Tullius, his &s;on-in-law, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, might have contributed to en|flame their re&s;entment. Whatever was the cau&s;e of their tardy vengeance, they re&s;olved to de&s;troy him, and at la&s;t found means to effect their purpo&s;e, by hiring two ruffians, who upon pretence of ju&s;tice, demanding to &s;peak with the king, &s;truck him dead in his palace with the blow of an ax. The lictors however, who waited upon the per&s;on of the king &s;eized the murderers, who were attempt|ing to e&s;cape; they were put to death, but the &s;ons of Ancus, who were the in&s;tigators, found &s;afety by flight.</P>
<P>Thus fell Lucius Tarquinius, &s;urnamed Pri&s;cus, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from one of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame name, aged fifty-&s;ix years, of which he had reigned thirty-eight. By having been of Greek extraction, he, in &s;ome manner introduced part of the polite arts of that country among his &s;ubjects, and though
<PB N="40" REF="51">
the Romans were as yet very far from being civilized, yet they certainly were much more &s;o than any of the barbarous nations round them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. From the death of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus to the death of Servius Tullius, the &s;ixth king of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="176" UNIT="U. C."> THE report of the murder of Tarquin filled all his &s;ubjects with complaint and indig|nation, while the citizens ran from every quarter to the palace, to learn the truth of the account, or to take vengeance on the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. In this tumult, Tanaquil, widow of the late king, con&s;idering the danger &s;he mu&s;t incur, in ca&s;e the con&s;pirators &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown; and de&s;irous of having her &s;on-in-law for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with great art di&s;&s;embled her &s;orrow and the king's death. She a&s;&s;ured the people, from one of the windows of the palace, that he was not killed, but &s;tunned by the blow; that he would &s;hortly recover, and that in the mean time, he had deputed his power to Servius Tullius, his &s;on-in-law. Servius, ac|cordingly as it had been agreed upon between them, i&s;&s;ued from the palace, adorned with the en&s;igns of royalty, and preceded by his lictors, went to di&s;patch &s;ome affairs that related to
<PB N="41" REF="52">
the public &s;afety; &s;till pretending, that he took all his in&s;tructions from the king. This &s;cene of di&s;&s;imulation continued for &s;ome days, till he had made his party good among the nobles, when the death of Tarquin being publickly a&s;certained, Servius came to the crown, &s;olely at the &s;enate's appointment, and without attempting to gain the &s;uffrages of the people.</P>
<P>Servius was the &s;on of a bondwoman, who had been taken at the &s;acking of a town be|longing to the Latins, and was born whil&s;t his mother was yet a &s;lave. While yet an infant in his cradle, a lambent flame is &s;aid to have played round his head, which Tanaquil con|verted into an omen of his future greatne&s;s. Impre&s;t with this opinion, &s;he gave him the be&s;t education of the times, and &s;oon after rai&s;ed him to the honour of being her &s;on-in-law, and appointed him, when the king grew old, to the management of affairs both of a dome&s;tic and foreign nature. His conduct in this &s;tation gained him the good-will of the people, and what he valued &s;till more, the e&s;teem of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>Upon being acknowledged as king, the chief object of his reign was to encrea&s;e the power of the &s;enate, by depre&s;&s;ing that of the people; an enterprize attended with extreme difficulty and danger. To compa&s;s his intention, he was to
<PB N="42" REF="53">
work by &s;tratagem, and by &s;eeming to &s;tudy their intere&s;t, bring about a mea&s;ure that &s;hould effectually de&s;troy their authority. The Roman citizens had hitherto been taxed &s;ingly, and each paid an equal &s;hare to the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate; this method of contribut|ing to the public exigencies, he pretended to con&s;ider as extremely unju&s;t, and propo&s;ed one of a more equitable kind, by which every ci|tizen &s;hould be only taxed according to his fortune. The populace, who were unable to &s;ee into his de&s;igns received his project with the loude&s;t applau&s;e, and conferred upon him a full power of &s;ettling the taxes as he &s;hould think proper. To begin therefore, he ordered an exact enumeration to be made of the citizens of Rome, their children and &s;ervants, and al&s;o a ju&s;t evaluation of their e&s;tates and &s;ub&s;tance. Their numbers were found to amount to above four&s;core thou&s;and men capable of bear|ing arms, a va&s;t encrea&s;e &s;ince the time of Romulus. The&s;e he divided into &s;ix cla&s;&s;es, in the fir&s;t of which he comprized the body of the &s;enate, the patricians, and all tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes were above eleven hundred thou&s;and a&s;&s;es, or about three hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix pounds of our money, at that time no contemptible fortune in Rome. This cla&s;s he divided into four&s;core centuries or companies,
<PB N="43" REF="54">
one half of which, being compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t aged and re&s;pectable per&s;ons, were to remain at home for the defence of the city; the other half, compo&s;ed of the youthful and vigorous, were to follow the general, and to march into the field. Their arms were, a javelin, a &s;pear, and a &s;word; their armour, a helmet, a cuira&s;s, and cui&s;hes of bra&s;s. In this cla&s;s al&s;o was comprized the knights or hor&s;emen, which con&s;i&s;ted of eighteen centuries, with two more of the machini&s;ts, who followed the camp. The &s;econd cla&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ted but of twenty-two centuries or companies, was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who were worth above &s;eventy-five thou|&s;and a&s;&s;es, the&s;e were accoutered in the &s;ame manner with the fir&s;t cla&s;s, only in&s;tead of a &s;hield, they carried a target. The third cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of twenty centuries, and was com|po&s;ed of &s;uch as were worth fifty thou&s;and a&s;&s;es. The fourth cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;imilar number of centuries, and was compo&s;ed of &s;uch as were worth twenty-five thou&s;and a&s;&s;es. In the fifth cla&s;s were thirty centuries, and the qualification was eleven thou&s;and a&s;&s;es, the&s;e were chiefly employed as &s;lingers and irregulars in the army. In the la&s;t cla&s;s there was but one century, and it &s;eemed con&s;idered as of no advantage to the &s;tate, except by breeding children, that might one day be u&s;eful. The&s;e paid no taxes, and
<PB N="44" REF="55">
were di&s;pen&s;ed with from going to war. In all the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, as in the fir&s;t, a part, con&s;i&s;ting of the old men, were ordained to remain at home for the defence of the city, and the more youthful to fight abroad in their armies. Thus the whole number of the citizens were divided into an hundred and ninety-three centuries, each commanded by a centurion, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his valour and experience.</P>
<P>The citizens being in this manner ranked, they were next to be taxed, but not as formerly, equally and one by one, but by centuries, each century being obliged to &s;upply an equal &s;hare to the exigencies of govern|ment. By the&s;e means, as the people were ex|tremely numerous in the centuries of the infe|rior cla&s;&s;es, their quota of the tax was propor|tionably &s;mall. It cannot be doubted but this partial exemption from taxes was greatly plea&s;|ing to the populace, but they little con&s;idered that they were to purcha&s;e it at the expence of their former power. For it was but rea&s;onable, that as the &s;enators and the rich furni&s;hed mo&s;t to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, they &s;hould al&s;o have a proportionable influence in managing its concerns. Accordingly, as they paid their taxes by centuries, he in&s;tituted, that they &s;hould give their votes in all public tran&s;ac|tions, by centuries al&s;o. In former delibera|tions
<PB N="45" REF="56">
each citizen gave his &s;uffrage &s;ingly, and the numbers of the poor always carried it again&s;t the power of the rich; but by the re|gulations of Servius, the &s;enate con&s;i&s;ting of a greater number of centuries than all the other cla&s;&s;es put together, now entirely out-weighed them in every contention. The plebeians in this manner were left but the &s;hadow of au|thority, with which however, for &s;ome ages, they &s;eemed &s;ufficiently contented, until the encrea&s;ing luxury of the times taught one &s;ide the abu&s;e of power, and the other, a pride that di&s;dained &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the encrea&s;e or decay of his &s;ubjects and their fortunes, he in&s;tituted another regulation which he called a lu&s;trum. By this all the citizens were to a&s;&s;emble in the Campus Martius, in complete armour, and in their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es, once in five years, and there to give an exact account of their families and fortune. He permitted &s;laves al&s;o to be &s;et free by their ma&s;ters, and cau&s;ed &s;uch as were thus manumitted, to be di&s;tributed among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the city.</P>
<P>The king having enjoyed a long reign, thus &s;pent in &s;ettling the dome&s;tic policy of the &s;tate, and al&s;o not unattentive to foreign con|cerns, for he overthrew the Etrurians in many battles, and triumphed over them three &s;everal times, conceived rea&s;onable hopes of concluding

it with tranquility and ea&s;e. Servius had even thoughts of laying down his power, and having formed the kingdom into a republick&punc; to retire into ob&s;curity; but &s;o generous a de&s;ign was fru&s;trated ere it could be put in execution.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his reign, to &s;ecure his throne by every precaution, he had married his two daughters to the two grand-&s;ons of Tarquin; and, as he knew that the women were of oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions, as well as their intended hu&s;bands, he re&s;olved to cro&s;s their tempers, by giving each to him of a contrary turn of temper; her that was meek and gentle, to him that was bold and furious; her that was ungovernable and proud, to him that was re|markable for a contrary character: by this he &s;uppo&s;ed, that each would correct the failings of the other, and that the mixture would be productive only of concord. The event how|ever proved otherwi&s;e. Lucius, his haughty &s;on-in-law, &s;oon grew di&s;plea&s;ed with the meek|ne&s;s of his con&s;ort, and placed his whole affec|tions upon Tullia, his brother's wife, who an|&s;wered his pa&s;&s;ion with &s;ympathetic ardour. As their wi&s;hes were ungovernable, they &s;oon re|&s;olved to break through every re&s;traint that offered to prevent their union; both under|took to murder their con&s;orts, which they ef|fected, and were accordingly &s;oon after mar|ried together. A fir&s;t crime ever produces a

&s;econd; from the de&s;truction of their con&s;orts, they proceeded to con&s;piring that of the king. They began by rai&s;ing factions again&s;t him, al|ledging his illegal title to the crown, and Lucius by claiming it as his own, as heir to Tarquin. But Tullius, by his prudence and great moderation, defeated this de&s;ign in the out&s;et, coming off with great honour both with the &s;enate and people, which brought Lucius to a feigned repentance on his &s;ide, and produced a real reconciliation on that of the king. Tullia however, &s;till continuing to add flame to her hu&s;band's ambition, which was al|ready all on fire, he continued his intrigues among the &s;enate, attaching the old to him, by putting them in mind of their obligations to his family&punc; the young, by gifts for the pre|&s;ent, and promi&s;es of much greater things upon his coming to the crown. At length, when he found them ripe for &s;econding his views, he entered the &s;enate hou&s;e, adorned with all the en&s;igns of royalty, and placing him&s;elf upon the throne, began to harangue them upon the ob&s;curity of the king's birth, and the inju&s;tice of his title. While he was yet &s;peaking, Ser|vius entered, attended by a few followers, and &s;eeing his throne thus rudely invaded, offered to pu&s;h the u&s;urper from his &s;eat; but Tarquin being in the vigour of youth, threw the old man down the &s;teps which led to the throne,
<PB N="48" REF="59">
and &s;ome of his adherents being in&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e, followed the king, as he was feebly attempting to get to the palace, and di&s;|patched him, throwing his body all mangled and bleeding, as a public &s;pectacle into the &s;treet. In the mean time, Tullia burning with impatience for the event, was informed of what her hu&s;band had done, and re&s;olving to be among the fir&s;t who &s;hould &s;alute him as monarch, ordered her chariot to drive to the &s;enate-hou&s;e, where her &s;avage joy &s;eemed to di&s;gu&s;t every beholder. Upon her return&punc; when her charioteer approached the place where the old king, her father's body lay ex|po&s;ed and bloody, the man all amazed at the inhuman &s;pectacle, and not willing to trample upon it with his hor&s;es feet, offered to turn an|other way, but this only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the fiercene&s;s of her anger, &s;he threw the foot&s;tool at his head, and ordered him to drive over it without deviation.</P>
<P>This was the end of Servius Tullius, a prince of eminent ju&s;tice and moderation, after an u&s;eful and pro&s;perous reign of forty-four years. Tho' the dominions of Rome had been but little encrea&s;ed by him, yet they acquired a &s;tability under his government, which far ex|ceeded the tran&s;ient &s;plendor of an exten&s;ive, but ha&s;ty conque&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. From the death of Servius Tullius to the Bani&s;h|ment of Tarquinius Superbus, the &s;eventh and la&s;t king of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>LUCIUS Tarquinius, afterwards called <MILESTONE N="220" UNIT="U. C."> Superbus, or the proud, having placed him|&s;elf upon the throne, in con&s;equence of his violent attempt, was re&s;olved to &s;upport his dignity with the &s;ame violence with which it was acquired. Regardle&s;s of the &s;enate or the people's approbation, he &s;eemed to claim the crown by an hereditary right, and refu&s;ed the late king's body inhumation, under pretence of his being an u&s;urper. All the good part of mankind however, looked upon his ac|ce&s;&s;ion with dete&s;tation and horror, and this act of inefficient cruelty only &s;erved to confirm their hatred. Con&s;cious of this, he ordered all &s;uch as he &s;u&s;pected to have been attached to Servius, to be put to death, and fearing the natural con&s;equences of his tyranny, encrea&s;ed the guard round his per&s;on.</P>
<P>His chief policy &s;eems to have been to keep the people always employed either in wars or public works, by which means he diverted their attention from his unlawful method of
<PB N="50" REF="61">
coming to the crown. With this view, he fir&s;t marched again&s;t the Sabines, who refu&s;ed to pay him obedience, and &s;oon reduced them to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He next began a war with the Vol&s;ci, which continued for &s;ome ages after, and from the&s;e he took Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;a Dometia, a con&s;iderable town about twenty-&s;ix miles ea&s;t of Rome. The city of the Gabii gave him much more trouble, for having attempted with &s;ome lo&s;s, to be&s;iege it, he was obliged to direct his efforts by &s;tratagem&punc; contrary to the u&s;ual practice of the Romans. He cau&s;ed his &s;on Sextus to counterfeit de&s;ertion, upon pre|tence of barbarous u&s;age from his father, and to &s;eek refuge among the inhabitants of the place. There, by artful complaints and &s;tudied lamentations, he &s;o prevailed upon the pity of the people, as to be cho&s;en their governor, and &s;oon after general of their army. He at fir&s;t, in every engagement, appeared &s;ucce&s;sful, till, at length, finding him&s;elf entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the confidence of the &s;tate, he &s;ent a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger to his father for in&s;tructions. Tarquin made no other an&s;wer, than taking the me&s;&s;en|ger into the garden, and cutting down before him the talle&s;t poppies. Sextus readily under|&s;tood the meaning of this reply, and one by one, found means of de&s;troying or removing the principal men of the city, &s;till taking care to confi&s;cate their effects among the people.
<PB N="51" REF="62">
The charms of this dividend kept the giddy populace blind to their approaching ruin, till they found them&s;elves at la&s;t, without coun|&s;ellors or head, and in the end, fell under the power of Tarquin, without even &s;triking a blow. After this, he made a league with the Aequi, and renewed that with the Etrurians.</P>
<P>But while he was engaged in wars abroad, he took care not to &s;uffer the people to con|tinue in idlene&s;s at home. He undertook to build the capitol, the foundation of which had been laid in a former reign, and an extraor|dinary event contributed to ha&s;ten the execu|tion of his de&s;ign. A woman, in &s;trange attire, made her appearance at Rome, and came to the king, offering to &s;ell nine books, which &s;he &s;aid were of her own compo&s;ing. Not knowing the abilities of the &s;eller, and that &s;he was in fact one of the celebrated &s;ybils, who&s;e prophecies were never found to fail, Tarquin re|fu&s;ed to buy them. Upon this &s;he departed, and burning three of her books, again demanded the &s;ame price for the &s;ix remaining; being de|&s;pi&s;ed as an impo&s;tor, &s;he again departed, and burning three more, returned with tho&s;e re|maining, &s;till a&s;king the &s;ame as at fir&s;t. Tar|quin &s;urprized at the incon&s;i&s;tency of her be|haviour, con&s;ulted the augurs, to advi&s;e him what to do. The&s;e much blamed him for not buying the nine, and commanded him to buy
<PB N="52" REF="63">
the three remaining, at what&s;oever price &s;he &s;hould demand. The woman, &s;ays the hi&s;to|rian, after thus &s;elling and delivering the three prophetic volumes, and advi&s;ing him to have a &s;pecial attention to what they contained, va|ni&s;hed from before him, and was never after &s;een. Upon this he cho&s;e proper per&s;ons to keep them, who, though but two at fir&s;t, were afterwards encrea&s;ed to fifteen, under the name of quindecemviri. They were put into a &s;tone che&s;t, and a vault in the newly-de&s;igned building, was thought the propere&s;t place to keep them in &s;afety; &s;o that the work went on with great vigour, and as omens and prodigies were frequent in this ignorant age, in digging the foundations, a man's head, named Tolus, was found, which, though he was many years dead, &s;till bled afre&s;h, as if he had been but newly &s;lain. This gave the building the name of capitol (caput Toli.) It was two hundred feet long, two hundred high, and almo&s;t as many broad, dedicated to Jupiter in chief, but containing two temples more, under the &s;ame roof, dedicated to Juno and Minerva. A &s;truc|ture &s;o magnificent, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure an indication of the encrea&s;e of arts in Rome, not le&s;s than of the piety of the people.</P>
<P>However, the time now began to approach, in which the people were to be freed from a tyrant, who, day after day, made new victims
<PB N="53" REF="64">
among them. Having been now for four years together employed in building the capitol, they began at la&s;t to wi&s;h for &s;omething new to engage them, wherefore Tarquin, to &s;atisfy their wi&s;hes, proclaimed war again&s;t the Rutuli, upon a frivolous pretence of their having en|tertained &s;ome malefactors whom he had ba|ni&s;hed, and inve&s;ted their chief city Ardea, which lay about &s;ixteen miles from Rome. While the army was encamped before this place, the king's &s;on Sextus, with Collatinus, a noble Roman, and &s;ome others, &s;at in a tent drinking together: the di&s;cour&s;e happening to turn upon the beauty and virtue of their wives, each man prai&s;ing his own, Collatinus offered to decide the di&s;pute, by putting it to an im|mediate trial, who&s;e wife &s;hould be found po&s;&s;e&s;t of the greate&s;t beauty and mo&s;t &s;edu|lou&s;ly employed, at that very hour. Being heated with wine, the propo&s;al was reli&s;hed by the whole company, and taking hor&s;e without delay, they po&s;ted to Rome, though the night was already pretty far advanced. Here they found Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, not like the other women of the age, &s;pending the time in ea&s;e and luxury, but &s;pinning in the mid&s;t of her maids, and chearfully portioning out their ta&s;ks. Her mode&s;t beauty, and the ea&s;y reception &s;he gave her hu&s;band and his friends, &s;o charmed them all, that they unani|mou&s;ly
<PB N="54" REF="65">
gave her the preference, and Sextus was &s;o much inflamed, that nothing but enjoy|ment could &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He went therefore from the camp to vi&s;it her privately a few days after, and received the &s;ame kind reception which he had met with before. As his intentions were not &s;u&s;pected, Lucretia &s;ate with him at &s;upper, and ordered a chamber to be got ready for him in the hou&s;e. Midnight was the time in which this ruffian thought it &s;afe&s;t to put his de&s;igns in execution. Having found means to convey him&s;elf into her chamber, he approached her bed-&s;ide with a drawn &s;word, and rudely laying his hand upon her bo&s;om, threatened her with in&s;tant death if &s;he offered to re&s;i&s;t his pa&s;&s;ion. Lu|cretia affrighted out of her &s;leep, and &s;eeing death &s;o near, was however, inexorable to his de&s;ire, till being told, that if &s;he would not yield, he would fir&s;t kill her, and then laying his own &s;lave dead by her &s;ide, he would re|port, that he had killed them thus in the act of adultery. The terror of infamy atchieved what that of death could not obtain; &s;he con&s;ented to his de&s;ire, and the next morning he returned to the camp, exulting in his brutal victory. In the mean time, Lucretia, dete&s;ting the light, and re&s;olving not to pardon her&s;elf for the crime of another, &s;ent for her hu&s;band Colla|tinus, and for Spurius her father, to come to
<PB N="55" REF="66">
her, as an indelible di&s;grace had befallen the family. The&s;e in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons, bringing with them Valerius, a kin&s;man of her father's, and Junius Brutus, a reputed ideot, who&s;e father Tarquin had murdered, and who had accidentally met the me&s;&s;enger by the way. Their arrival only &s;erved to encrea&s;e Lucretia's poignant angui&s;h; they found her in a &s;tate of &s;teadfa&s;t de&s;peration, and vainly attempted to give her relief. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, (&s;aid &s;he) never &s;hall I find any thing worth living for in this life, after having lo&s;t my honour. You &s;ee, my Collatinus, a polluted wretch before you, one who&s;e per&s;on has been the &s;poil of another, but who&s;e affections were never e&s;tranged from you. Sextus, under the pretended veil of friend&s;hip, has this night forced from me that trea&s;ure, which death only can re|&s;tore; but if you have the hearts of men, remember to avenge my cau&s;e, and let po&s;|terity know, that &s;he who has lo&s;t her virtue, had only death for her be&s;t con&s;olation."</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he drew a poignard from beneath her robe, and in&s;tantly plunging it in her bo&s;om, ex|&s;pired without a groan. The whole company re|mained for &s;ome time fixed in &s;orrow, pity and indignation; Spurius and Collatinus at length gave a vent to their grief in tears, but Brutus drawing the poignard reeking from Lucretia's wound, and lifting it up towards Heaven,

<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="56" REF="67">"Be witne&s;s ye Gods, he cried, that from this moment I proclaim my&s;elf the avenger of the cha&s;te Lucretia's cau&s;e: from this mo|ment I profe&s;s my&s;elf the enemy of Tarquin, and his lu&s;tful hou&s;e: from henceforth &s;hall this life, while life continues, be employed in oppo&s;ition to tyranny, and for the happi|ne&s;s and freedom of my much loved country."</Q> A new amazement &s;eized the hearers, to find him, whom they had heretofore con&s;idered as an ideot, now appearing in his real character, the friend of ju&s;tice, and of Rome. He told them that tears and lamentations were un|manly, when vengeance called&punc; &s;o loud, and delivering the poignard to the re&s;t, impo&s;ed the &s;ame oath upon them, which he him&s;elf had ju&s;t taken.</P>
<P>Junius Brutus was the &s;on of Marcus Junius, a noble Roman, who was married to the daugh|ter of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, and for that rea&s;on, through a motive of jealou&s;y, was put to death by Tarquin the Proud. Junius Brutus, the &s;on, had received an excellent education from his father, and had from nature, &s;trong &s;en&s;e, and an inflexible attachment to virtue: but perceiv|ing that Tarquin had privily murdered his fa|ther and his elde&s;t brother, he counterfeited him&s;elf a fool, in order to e&s;cape the &s;ame danger, and thence obtained the &s;urname of Brutus. Tarquin thinking his folly real, de|&s;pi&s;ed
<PB N="57" REF="68">
the man, and having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of his e&s;tate, kept him as an ideot in his hou&s;e, merely with a view of making &s;port for his children. It happened in a time of threatened danger, that Brutus was &s;ent with Tarquin's two &s;ons, to con&s;ult the oracle, upon the me|thods expedient to avert the calamity. The &s;ons were plea&s;ed with his company, and laughed to &s;ee him offer his &s;taff at the &s;hrine of Apollo, which however, was a much more valuable pre&s;ent to the god, than theirs, as it had been made hollow, and then filled with gold. The young men, after executing their father's com|mands, next enquired of the oracle, which of them &s;hould be king of Rome; to which it was an&s;wered, that he who &s;hould fir&s;t ki&s;s his mother, &s;hould gain the kingdom. In con&s;e|quence of this, they both re&s;olved to ki&s;s their mother at the &s;ame time, and thus reign toge|ther. Brutus however who dived into the real meaning of the oracle, as &s;oon as they were arrived in Italy, pretended accidentally to fall down, and ki&s;&s;ing the earth, &s;aluted her, which he con&s;idered as the general parent of all. From that time, he conceived hopes of being the deliverer of his country, and chacing the tyrant Tarquin and his whole family from Rome.</P>
<P>Brutus having now the faire&s;t opportunity of ridding his country of a tyrant, that had long
<PB N="58" REF="69">
harra&s;&s;ed it with impunity, procured with all expedition the gates of the city to be &s;hut, till &s;uch time as the people would be a&s;&s;embled, and a public decree for Tarquin's bani&s;hment &s;hould be attempted. Accordingly, he cau&s;ed Lucretia's dead body to be brought out to view, and expo&s;ed in the public forum, while the citizens, who ran tumultuou&s;ly from old quarters to &s;ee it, were at fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ed with pity, which &s;oon after changed into rage and ungovernable fury: this was the di&s;po&s;ition which he had &s;o often longed for in vain, and now therefore enflaming their ardour by a di&s;play of the horrid tran&s;action, and &s;till more by the glorious hopes of future freedom, he obtained a decree of the &s;enate, that Tarquin and his family &s;hould be for ever bani&s;hed from Rome, and that it &s;hould be capital for any to plead for, or attempt his future return. Tarquin, in the mean time, having heard of the&s;e commotions at the army, flew with the utmo&s;t expedition to Rome, in hopes to quell and puni&s;h the delinquents; but finding the gates &s;hut, and the walls full of armed men, he prepared to return, fill'd with indignation, to the camp: but Brutus had taken care here al&s;o to prevent him, for expeditiou&s;ly getting to the army by another road, he acquainted the &s;oldiers with what had been done in the city, how Lucretia was abu&s;ed and fallen, and how
<PB N="59" REF="70">
the &s;enate and people had e&s;pou&s;ed her quarrel. The &s;ame &s;entiments of humanity which had impelled the citizens, touched the army al&s;o. They agreed to act with their friends at home, and when Tarquin came back, they refu&s;ed to admit him. Thus this monarch, who had now reigned twenty-five years, being expelled his kingdom, went to take refuge with his family at Cira, a little city of Etruria. In the mean time, the Roman army made a truce with the enemy, and Brutus was proclaimed, deliverer of the people.</P>
<P>Thus ended with Tarquin the regal &s;tate of Rome, after it had continued two hundred and forty-five years, and &s;till with a gradual, tho' &s;low increa&s;e. Although, at the time of Tar|quin's expul&s;ion, the territory of the Romans was not above forty miles long, and thirty broad, yet their government was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that vigour, which bodies of a &s;low growth are generally found to enjoy; nor were they at any time ma&s;ters of greater territory, than they had forces to keep in obedience. Few hi&s;tories can &s;hew a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings, replete with more virtue and moderation, than tho&s;e who fir&s;t go|verned in Rome: it was from their wi&s;e in&s;ti|tutions, that the people &s;eemed to acquire all that courage, that piety, and that patrioti&s;m, which afterwards operated in conquering man|kind. Their &s;ubjects might have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="60" REF="71">
of all the ru&s;tic fiercene&s;s of the times, indeed, but it mu&s;t have been owing to the monarchs only, that their very enemies reaped the benefit of their victories; it mu&s;t have been the gene|ral's virtue alone that could protect tho&s;e whom the &s;oldiers valour had &s;ubdued. The Grecian legi&s;lators had the Egyptians to imitate, but the Romans were placed in the mid&s;t of na|tions far more barbarous than them&s;elves, and all the wi&s;dom of their monarchs was chiefly of their own formation. Hitherto how|ever, we only &s;ee the genius of the nation making faint &s;truggles to get free from her native ferocity, ob&s;tructed by cu&s;tom at home, and barbarous example abroad; yet &s;till upon particular occa&s;ions, exerting a noblene&s;s of mind, &s;till aiming at imagined virtue, and ma|je&s;tic, even in infancy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. From the bani&s;hment of Tarquin to the appointment of the fir&s;t dictator.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="245" UNIT="U. C."> THE regal power being overthrown, a form of government, nominally republican, was &s;ub&s;tituted in its room. The &s;enate however, re&s;erved by far the greate&s;t &s;hare of the autho|rity to them&s;elves, and decorated their own
<PB N="61" REF="72">
body with all the &s;poils of depo&s;ed monarchy. The centuries of the people cho&s;e from among the &s;enators, in&s;tead of a king, two annual ma|gi&s;trates, whom they called con&s;uls, with power equal to that of the regal, and with the &s;ame privileges, and the &s;ame en&s;igns of authority. Though the liberty of the people was but very little encrea&s;ed by this in&s;titution, yet to it Rome afterwards, in a great mea&s;ure, owed its unequalled grandeur. In the life of a king, there are many periods of indolence and of pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;erve to divert him from the pub|lic good; but in a commonwealth, governed by magi&s;trates annually cho&s;en, each has no time to lo&s;e, and to attain his ambition, all his exertions mu&s;t be within the year. Hence it is, that tho&s;e magi&s;trates were ever per&s;uad|ing to &s;ome new war, and pointing out fre&s;h enemies every day. The people thus kept in continual alarms, attained a more perfect know|lede of the military arts, and were better enabled to adopt the improvements of the various na|tions they were led to engage.</P>
<P>Brutus, the deliverer of his country, and Col|latinus, the hu&s;band of Lucretia, were cho&s;en fir&s;t con&s;uls in Rome. They immediately revived the laws for a&s;&s;embling the people, which had been di&s;continued during the late tyrant's reign; but that their newly acquired liberty &s;hould be prevented from degenerating into licentiou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="62" REF="73">
&s;everal officers relative to the prie&s;thood were appointed, and new &s;acrifices ordained.</P>
<P>This new republick however, which &s;eemed &s;o grateful to the people, had like to have been de&s;troyed in its very commencement. A party was formed in Rome in favour of Tar|quin. Some young men of the principal fa|milies in the &s;tate, who had been educated about the king, and had &s;hared in all the luxu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">es and plea&s;ures of the court, undertook to re|e&s;tabli&s;h monarchy. They were di&s;gu&s;ted with the gloomy au&s;terity of a republican fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> of government, in which the laws, inflexible and &s;evere, made no di&s;tinctions of birth, or for|tune. This party &s;ecretly encrea&s;ed every day, and what may create our &s;urprize, the &s;ons of Brutus him&s;elf, and the Aquilii, the nephews of Collatinus, were among the number. Tar|quin, who was informed of the&s;e intrigues in his favour, was re&s;olved to advance them by every art in his power, and accordingly &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors from Etruria to Rome, under a pretence of reclaiming the crown, and demand|ing the effects which he had left behind him, but in reality, with a de&s;ign to give &s;pirit to his faction, and to draw over to it as many as he could. They accordingly went on with &s;ucce&s;s, holding their private meetings at the hou&s;e of one of the con&s;pirators, and already the re&s;tora|tion of the king, and the death of the con&s;uls was
<PB N="63" REF="74">
re&s;olved upon. However, their trea&s;on could not be long concealed&punc; a &s;lave who had accidentally hid him&s;elf in the room where the con&s;pirators u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble, overheard their conver&s;ation, and laid open their whole de&s;ign to the con&s;uls, who gave orders to have the con&s;pirators &s;e|cured and brought before them, among whom were the &s;ons of Brutus. Few &s;ituations could have been more terribly affecting than this of a father, placed as a judge upon the life and death of his own children; impelled by ju&s;tice to condemn, and by nature to &s;pare them. The young men accu&s;ed, pleaded nothing for them|&s;elves, but with con&s;cious guilt, awaited their &s;entence in &s;ilence and agony. The other judges who were pre&s;ent, felt all the pangs of nature; Collatinus wept, and Valerius could not repre&s;s the &s;entiments of pity. Brutus alone &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all the &s;oftne&s;s of humanity, and with a &s;tern countenance, and a tone of voice that marked his gloomy re&s;olution, demanded of his &s;ons, if they could make any defence to the crimes with which they had been charged. This demand he made three &s;everal times, and having received no an&s;wer, he at length, turned him&s;elf to the executioner, now, cried he, it is your part to perform the re&s;t: thus &s;aying, he again re|&s;umed his &s;eat, with an air of determined ma|je&s;ty; nor could all the &s;entiments of paternal pity, nor all the imploring looks of the people,

nor yet the complaints of the young men, who were preparing for execution, al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er the tenor of his re&s;olution. The executioners having &s;tripped them naked, and then whipped them with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ils, pre&s;ently after beheaded them; Brutus all the time beholding the cruel &s;pectacle with a &s;teady look and unaltered countenance, while the multitude gazed on with all the &s;en&s;ations of pity, terror and admiration.</P>
<P>The con&s;tancy of Brutus, during the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">u|tion of his two &s;ons, &s;erved greatly to encrea&s;e his authority in Rome; but the lenity of his colleague Collatinus, was con&s;idered in a very different light: his having attempted to &s;ave the Vitellii, his nephews, rendered him &s;u&s;|pected to the citizens; he was accordingly de|po&s;ed from the con&s;ul&s;hip, and bani&s;hed Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; and Valerius, afterwards &s;urnamed Publicola from his regard to the people, was elected con&s;ul in his room.</P>
<P>All Tarquin's hopes of an in&s;urrection in the city in his favour being thus overthrown, he was now re&s;olved to force him&s;elf upon his former throne by foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to that end prevailed upon the Veians to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and with a con&s;iderable army advanced towards Rome.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="246" UNIT="U. C."> The con&s;uls were not remi&s;s in preparations to oppo&s;e him. Valerius commanding the foot, and Brutus being appointed to head the cavalry,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
went out to meet him on the Roman borders. Aruns the &s;on of Tarquin, who commanded the cavalry for his father, &s;eeing Brutus at a di&s;tance, was re&s;olved, by one great attempt, to decide the fate of the day, before the en|gaging of the armies, wherefore &s;purring on his hor&s;e, he made toward him with ungovernable fury. Brutus, who perceived his approach, &s;ingled out from the ranks to meet him, and and both met with &s;uch rage, that eager only to a&s;&s;ail, and thoughtle&s;s of defending, they both fell dead upon the field together. A bloody battle en&s;ued, with equal &s;laughter on both &s;ides; but the Romans remaining in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle, claimed the vic|tory, in con&s;equence of which, Valerius return|ed in triumph to Rome.</P>
<P>Brutus being thus removed without having compleated his year, Valerius continued for &s;ome time to enjoy the dignity without a col|league, which excited the jealou&s;ies of the people, who were apprehen&s;ive that he had thoughts of a&s;piring to the crown. A palace which he had built with &s;ome magnificence, upon an eminence, augmented the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, and it was reported, that he had intentions of converting it into a fortre&s;s, in order to awe the city. Valerius however, &s;oon quieted their fears, by ordering his palace to be pulled down, and to &s;hew the rectitude of his intentions, made
<PB N="66" REF="77">
&s;everal laws, abridging the power of the &s;enate, and extending that of the people. By one, he allowed an appeal from the con&s;uls to the people; by another, he made it death for any man to a&s;&s;ume the office of magi&s;trate without the people's con&s;ent; a third gave power to any man to kill the per&s;on, unheard, who affected the &s;upreme power, if he could demon&s;trate the crime. He al&s;o appointed que&s;tors, or trea&s;urers, who were to have the management of the government's money, and the care of accommodating amba&s;&s;adors. Still more to in|gratiate him&s;elf with the public, he ordered the rods which the lictors carried, to be &s;eparated from the axes, intimating thereby, that the power of capitally puni&s;hing lay no longer in the con&s;uls, but the people. Having thus &s;a|tisfied their &s;cruples, he cho&s;e Lucretius, the father of Lucretia, for his colleague in the con|&s;ul&s;hip. Dying a &s;hort time after, he was &s;ucceeded by Horatius, and the time of annual election coming on &s;oon after, Valerius was cho&s;en a &s;econd time, and with him Lucretius, who numbered the people. They were found to amount to an hundred and thirty thou&s;and, be&s;ides widows and orphans.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Tarquin, no way intimi|dated by his misfortunes, &s;till formed alliances to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in regaining the crown, and pre|vailed upon Por&s;enna, one of the kings of Etru|ria,
<PB N="67" REF="78">
to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and in per&s;on under|take his quarrel. This prince, equally noted for courage and conduct, marched directly to Rome with a numerous army, and laid &s;iege to the city, while the terror of his name and his arms fill'd all ranks of people with di&s;may. The &s;enate, in this exigence, did all that prudence could &s;ugge&s;t, both to quiet the fears, and &s;a|tisfy the wants of the people. They ordered, that the populace &s;hould pay no taxes to the &s;tate, during the continuance of the war, al|ledging, that they did enough in educating children to defend it. Still more, they purcha&s;ed corn over various parts of Campania, and had it brought to Rome, to be di&s;tributed at a low price to the people. The&s;e indulgences linked the orders of the &s;tate &s;o firmly together, that every citizen &s;eemed re&s;olved to defend his country to the la&s;t, and &s;ave Rome, or expire in its ruins. The &s;iege however was carried on with vigour: a furious attack was made upon the place: the two con&s;uls oppo&s;ed in vain, and were carried off wounded from the field; while the Romans flying in great con&s;ternation, were pur&s;ued by the enemy to the bridge, over which, both victors and vanqui&s;hed were about to enter the city in the confu&s;ion. All now appeared lo&s;t and over, when Horatius Cocles, who had been placed there as centinel to defend it, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the torrent of the enemy,
<PB N="68" REF="79">
and a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by two more, for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tained the whole fury of the a&s;&s;ault, till the bridge was broken down behind him; when, plunging with his arms into the torrent of the Tyber, he &s;wam back victorious to his fellow|&s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Still however, Por&s;enna was determined upon taking the city, and though five hundred of his men were &s;lain in a &s;ally of the Romans, he reduced it to the greate&s;t &s;traights, and turn|ing the &s;iege into a blockade, re&s;olved to take it by famine. The di&s;tre&s;s of the be&s;ieged &s;oon began to be in&s;ufferable, and all things &s;eemed to threaten a &s;peedy &s;urrender, when another act of fierce bravery, &s;till &s;uperior to that which had &s;aved the city before, again procured its &s;afety and freedom.</P>
<P>Mutius, a youth of undaunted bravery, was re&s;olved to rid his country of an enemy, that &s;o &s;orely continued to oppre&s;s it; and for this purpo&s;e, di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of an Etrurian pea&s;ant, entered the camp of the enemy, re|&s;olved to die or to kill the king. With this re&s;olution he made up to the place where Por|&s;enna was paying his troops, with a &s;ecretary by his &s;ide; but mi&s;taking the latter for the king, he &s;tabbed him to the heart, and was immediately apprehended, and brought back to the royal pre&s;ence. Upon Por&s;enna's demand|ing who he was, and the cau&s;e of &s;o heinous an
<PB N="69" REF="80">
action, Mutius, without re&s;erve, informed him of his country and his de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time thru&s;ting his right hand into a fire that burnt upon an altar before him,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;ee," cried he, "how little I regard the &s;e|vere&s;t puni&s;hment your cruelty can inflict upon me. A Roman knows not only how to act, but to &s;uffer: I am not the only per&s;on you have to fear, three hundred of the Roman youth, like me, have con&s;pired your de&s;truction, therefore prepare for their attempts."</Q> Por&s;enna amazed at &s;o much in|trepidity, had too noble a mind not to ac|knowledge merit though found in an enemy, he therefore ordered him to be &s;afely con|ducted back to Rome, and offered the be&s;ieg|ed conditions of peace. The&s;e were readily accepted on their &s;ide, being neither hard nor di&s;graceful, except that twenty ho&s;tages were demanded, ten young men, and as many vir|gins of the be&s;t families in Rome. But even in this in&s;tance al&s;o, as if the gentler &s;ex were re&s;olved to be &s;harers in the de&s;perate valour of the times, Clelia, one of the ho&s;|tages e&s;caping from her guards, and pointing out the way to the re&s;t of her female compa|nions, &s;wam over the Tyber on hor&s;eback, amid&s;t &s;howers of darts from the enemy, and pre&s;ented her&s;elf to the con&s;ul. This magi&s;trate however, fearing the con&s;equences of detaining
<PB N="70" REF="81">
her, had her &s;ent back; upon which, Por&s;enna, not to be out-done in genero&s;ity, not only gave her liberty, but permitted her to chu&s;e &s;uch of the ho&s;tages, of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, as &s;he &s;hould think fit to attend her. On her part, &s;he, with all the mode&s;ty of a Roman virgin, cho&s;e only &s;uch as were under fourteen, alledging, that their tender age was lea&s;t capable of &s;u&s;taining the rigours of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Little remarkable happened after this for about five years, if we except two or three victories obtained over the Sabines, who were obliged to purcha&s;e a peace, and over whom the con&s;uls obtained two triumphs, and the fir&s;t ovation that had been &s;een in Rome, which differed from a triumph in the&s;e re&s;pects, that in an ovation, the general entered the city on foot, and not as in the other ca&s;e in a cha|riot; that he was met only by the knights and patricians, and not by the &s;enators in their robes; that his dre&s;s was le&s;s magnificent, and that his crown, in&s;tead of being of lawrel, was made only of myrtle. Po&s;thumius, who over|came the Sabines, was the fir&s;t who was de|creed this le&s;&s;er kind of triumph, becau&s;e his &s;ucce&s;s was not obtained but at the expence of a former defeat. Some other victories followed, but we will not dilate upon the&s;e &s;mall advan|tages, which though they contributed to extend the empire, are at pre&s;ent attended neither with curio&s;ity nor in&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="82">
Tarquin, though often di&s;appointed, was &s;till un&s;ubdued and un&s;haken. By means of his &s;on-in-law Manilius, he &s;tirred up the La|tins to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;t, and took the mo&s;t convenient opportunity, when the plebeians and &s;enators were divided among&s;t each other, to make head again&s;t Rome. After having united twenty-four towns in his confedracy abroad, he, by large bribes, found means to win over a very powerful party of the poorer &s;ort of citizens from their new government, who al&s;o had many real cau&s;es of di&s;content to di&s;gu&s;t them, and to which they &s;oon after gave vent,</P>
<P>The Romans, under their kings, had only <MILESTONE N="255" UNIT="U. C."> two ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, by agriculture and by plunder; they lived either by labouring their own lands, or by reaping the harve&s;ts which had been &s;own by their enemies. Soon how|ever, after the extinction of royalty, the &s;e|nators and patricians, who were in effect &s;o|vereigns of the country, appropriated to them|&s;elves the greate&s;t part of the lands which were the rights of conque&s;t, and in&s;en&s;ibly ex|tended their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at the expence of the public. In vain the &s;oldier fought to enlarge the limits of the dominions of Rome, the great came in and &s;hared the fruit of his labour, tho' they had no participation in the danger.
<PB N="72" REF="83">
The poverty of the &s;oldier by the&s;e means, obliged him to borrow money upon u&s;ury, and as that was exorbitant, it only &s;erved to encrea&s;e his wretchedne&s;s. The laws al&s;o of Rome per|mitted the creditor to &s;eize the per&s;on of the in&s;olvent debtor, and to employ him as a &s;lave, till the debt was paid: this complication of mi&s;ery &s;oon excited the murmurs of the poor, till from entreaties to their ma&s;ters, they pro|ceeded to menaces. The attempt of Tarquin to regain the crown, &s;eemed to them a favour|able conjuncture to regain tho&s;e rights, of which they had been in&s;en&s;ibly deprived. When the con&s;uls therefore came to levy men in order to oppo&s;e him, to their great amazement, all the poor, and all who were loaded with debt, re|fu&s;ed to enli&s;t, declaring that tho&s;e who enjoyed the advantages of peace, might undergo the fatigues of war, but that for their part, they were wearied with expo&s;ing their lives for no|thing, or for what was &s;till wor&s;e, for ma&s;ters who undervalued their labours, and only rioted upon their di&s;tre&s;s. They acknowledged no city nor country, they &s;aid, which would not give them protection, and by leaving Rome, they only left behind them their mi&s;eries, their oppre&s;&s;ors and their debts. They therefore in&s;i&s;ted, that their debts &s;hould be cancelled by a decree of the &s;enate, as the only means of inducing them to the field. At fir&s;t the &s;enate
<PB N="73" REF="84">
endeavoured to appea&s;e the populace by gentle methods, but finding the&s;e un&s;ucce&s;sful, they entered into a &s;erious con&s;ideration upon &s;o im|portant an affair. There were &s;ome for a free remi&s;&s;ion of all debts, as the &s;afe&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t method at that juncture. Others urged the dangerous con&s;equences of this conde&s;cen&s;ion, advi&s;ing, that only &s;uch &s;hould be enli&s;ted, as thought fit to give in their names, and that the re&s;t &s;hould be treated with contempt. At length they came to a re&s;olution to put off the impend|ing evil by delay, and to publi&s;h an order, that no debtor &s;hould be mole&s;ted during the con|tinuance of the war. The people however, to whom the &s;enate offered this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion as a favour, refu&s;ed it with acrimony and contempt. They knew that this was only putting off that grievance, which would &s;oon fall upon them with encrea&s;ed &s;everity; they knew that the ap|proach of the enemy had extorted from the &s;e|nate what they would re&s;ume when their terrors &s;hould be over, and therefore they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their demands. The number of the male|contents encrea&s;ed every hour, and many of the people who were neither poor nor involved in debt, entered into and &s;hared their griefs, either from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the rectitude of their demands, or from the natural di&s;like which all men have to their &s;uperiors. In this exigence therefore, the &s;enate, who &s;aw the
<PB N="74" REF="85">
commonwealth upon the brink of ruin, had recour&s;e to an expedient, which though &s;uc|ce&s;sful for the pre&s;ent, in a cour&s;e of ages was fatal to the republick of Rome. The con&s;uls finding their authority in&s;ufficient, offered the people to elect a temporary magi&s;trate, who &s;hould have ab&s;olute power, not only over all ranks of &s;tate, but even over the laws them|&s;elves. To this, the plebeians, who held the &s;enate in abhorrence, readily con&s;ented, willing to give up their own power, for the &s;ake of abridging that of their &s;uperiors. In con&s;e|quence of this, Largius was created the fir&s;t Dictator of Rome, for &s;o was this high office called, being nominated to it by his colleague in the con&s;ul&s;hip. Thus the people who could not bear to hear the name of king even men|tioned, readily &s;ubmitted to a magi&s;trate po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of much greater power: &s;o much do the names of things mi&s;lead us, and &s;o little is any form of government irk&s;ome to people when it coincides with their prejudices. This was the fir&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion of the con&s;ular power about ten years after it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. From the creation of the fir&s;t dictator, to the elec|tion of the tribunes of the people.</HEAD>
<P>LARGIUS being now created dictator, en|tered <MILESTONE N="255" UNIT="U. C."> upon his office &s;urrounded with his lictors and all the en&s;igns of ancient royalty, and &s;eated upon a throne in the mid&s;t of the people, or|dered the levies to be made, in the manner of the kings of Rome. The populace looked with terror upon a magi&s;trate whom they had in|ve&s;ted with uncontroulable power, and peace|ably went each to range him&s;elf under his re|&s;pective &s;tandard. The Latins being informed of this change in the government of the city, began to lo&s;e all the expectations which they had conceived from its divi&s;ions, they accord|ingly thought proper to li&s;ten to an accommo|dation, which was propo&s;ed on the &s;ide of Rome, and a truce was agreed upon between them for a year. Largius, who had been &s;ent to oppo&s;e the enemy, returned with his army to Rome, and before his &s;ix months were out, (the time limited for this office) he laid down the dictator&s;hip, with the reputation of having exerci&s;ed it with blamele&s;s lenity.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="87">
It &s;eems however, that the year en&s;uing there was occa&s;ion for another dictator, as we find Po&s;thumius inve&s;ted with that office, and lead|ing out the Romans to pro&s;ecute the war with the Latins, upon expiration of the truce be|tween them. We are told, that coming up with them near the lake Regillus, he gave them a complete overthrow, though they were al|mo&s;t double his number, and that &s;carce a fourth of their army e&s;caped alive from the field. It would be unimproving however and tedious to give the particulars of the engage|ments of this warlike people, in the infancy of their empire, while yet they &s;eem but the tu|multuary meetings of brave but ob&s;tinate men, who&s;e valour alone, rather than conduct, de|cided the fortune of the day. In this battle, we are particularly told, that the dictator ca&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e of the en&s;igns among the enemy, to incite his men to a bold attempt for the recovery: we are told al&s;o, that the bridles were ordered to be taken off the hor&s;es, that they might charge with greater fury. Generals who could give &s;uch directions might have been bold men, but very bad commanders. Neverthe|le&s;s, they fought again&s;t an enemy more igno|rant than them&s;elves, &s;o that the Latins ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nowledging their &s;uperiority, implored a truce once more, and the dictator, after a triumph, laid down his authority.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="88">
The &s;oldiers having now once more returned from the field in triumph, had &s;ome rea&s;on to expect a remi&s;&s;ion of their debts, and to enjoy that &s;afety for them&s;elves, which they had pro|cured for the public. However, contrary to their hopes, the courts of ju&s;tice were opened again&s;t them, and the pro&s;ecution of creditors revived with more than former acrimony. This began to excite fre&s;h murmurs, and the &s;enate, who were &s;en&s;ible of them, in order to be pre|pared, cho&s;e Appius Claudius, a man of au&s;tere manners, a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the laws, and of un&s;haken intrepidity, for one of the con&s;uls the year en&s;uing: but, at the &s;ame time, to temper his &s;everity, they gave him for a col|league, Servilius, a man of an humane and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, and as much loved by the populace, as Appius was hateful to them. When the complaints of the people therefore came to be deliberated upon, the&s;e two magi&s;trates, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, were entirely of oppo&s;ite opinions. Servilius commi&s;erating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, was for aboli&s;hing all debts, or at lea&s;t for dimini&s;hing the intere&s;t upon them. Appius, on the other hand, with his natural &s;e|verity, in&s;i&s;ted that the laws of his country &s;hould be inviolably ob&s;erved, and that lighten|ing the load from tho&s;e who owed money, was but throwing it upon tho&s;e to whom it was due. That it would be encouraging the extravagant
<PB N="78" REF="89">
and the idle, at the expence of the indu&s;trious and the frugal, and that every new compliance from the &s;enate, would but encrea&s;e the in&s;olent demands of the people.</P>
<P>The populace being apprized of the different opinions of their con&s;uls concerning their com|plaints, loaded Servilius with every mark of gratitude, while they every where pur&s;ued Ap|pius with threats and imprecations. They now therefore, began to a&s;&s;emble afre&s;h, to hold &s;e|cret cabals by night, and to meditate &s;ome new revolution, when an unlooked for &s;pectacle of di&s;tre&s;s rouzed all their pa&s;&s;ions, and at once fanned their kindling re&s;entment into flame.</P>
<P>A Roman &s;oldier, who &s;eemed in age, came to take refuge in the mid&s;t of the people, loaden with chains, yet &s;hewing in his air the marks of better days: he was covered with rags, his face was pale and wa&s;ted with famine, his beard, which was long and neglected, and his hair in wild di&s;order, rendered his appearance &s;till more gha&s;tly. He was known however, to have once performed gallant &s;ervices in the field; he &s;hewed the &s;cars which he had received in battle, and the marks of recent &s;tripes which &s;till continued bleeding. The compa&s;&s;ion of the multitude was excited at this &s;pectacle, but much more when he told them his &s;tory. Having borne arms in the la&s;t war again&s;t the Sabines, his little patri|mony was not only neglected, but the enemy
<PB N="79" REF="90">
had plundered his &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;et his hou&s;e on fire. He was thus forced for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to contract debts, and then obliged to &s;ell his inheritance to di&s;charge them; but a part &s;till remaining unpaid, his unfeeling creditor had dragged him to pri&s;on, where he was not only loaded with chains, but torn with the whips of the executioner, who was ordered to torment him. This account, and his wounds which were &s;till fre&s;h, produced an in&s;tanta|neous uproar among the people: they flew to take revenge not only on the delinquent, but on the general body of their oppre&s;&s;ors. Appius had the fortune to procure &s;afety by flight. Servilius laying a&s;ide the marks of con&s;ular power, threw him&s;elf into the mid&s;t of the tumult, entreated, flattered, commanded them to patience: engaged to have their wrongs re|dre&s;&s;ed by the &s;enate; promi&s;&s;ed that he him&s;elf would warmly &s;upport their cau&s;e, and in the mean time, to convince them of his good inten|tions, made proclamation, that no citizen &s;hould be arre&s;ted for debt, until the &s;enate &s;hould i&s;&s;ue further directions.</P>
<P>The remon&s;trances of Servilius, for this time, &s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure to appea&s;e their mur|murs, and the &s;enate was going to begin their deliberations, when word was brought, that an army of Vol&s;cians was marching directly to|wards Rome. This was an event which the
<PB N="80" REF="91">
people had wi&s;hed with the mo&s;t ardent expecta|tion, and they now re&s;olved to let the nobles &s;ee, how little the power of the rich avails, when un|&s;upported by the &s;trength of the multitude. Accordingly, when the levy came to be made for &s;oldiers, they unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to enli&s;t, while tho&s;e who had been impri&s;oned for debt, &s;hewing their chains, a&s;ked with an in&s;ulting &s;mile, whether the&s;e were the weapons with which they were to face the enemy.</P>
<P>Rome, in this &s;tate of anarchy within, and of threatened inva&s;ion from without, was upon the brink of ruin, when Servilius, who, as con&s;ul, was to command the army, once more renewed his entreaties with the people, not to de&s;ert him in this exigence. To &s;ooth them &s;till more, he i&s;&s;ued a new edict, that no citizen &s;hould be impri&s;oned during the continuance of the war, and a&s;&s;ured them, that upon their return, they &s;hould have plenary redre&s;s. By the&s;e promi&s;es, as well as by the affection which the people had to his per&s;on, he once more prevailed. The citizens came in crowds to enrol them&s;elves under his command; he led them to meet the enemy, and gained a compleat victory. But of all tho&s;e who &s;hewed their courage in the engagement, the debtors and former malecon|tents were the mo&s;t con&s;picuous. Servilius, to re|compence their bravery, gave them the plunder of the enemies camp, without re&s;erving, as was

u&s;ual, any part of it to the trea&s;ury; and this perhaps was the cau&s;e which induced the &s;enate upon his return to refu&s;e him the honours of a triumph.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the terrors of the enemy re|moved, but the former cruelties began afre&s;h. Appius, &s;till fierce and uncomplying, again au|thorized creditors to renew their rights, and debtors were dragged to pri&s;on, and in&s;ulted as before. In vain did they implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Servilius, who, gentle and wavering, deputed too much of his power to Appius. In vain did they claim the promi&s;es made them by the &s;e|nate, that body, deaf to their cries, &s;aw debtors pur&s;ued even into the Forum by their merci|le&s;s ma&s;ters, and prevented only by the multi|tude from being haled to pri&s;on. The ap|proach of an enemy, &s;till more numerous than that which had been lately conquered, retarded the acrimony of their vengeance. The Sabines, the Equi, and the Vol&s;cians, as if willing to &s;econd the views of the people, again made a fierce irruption, while the citizens refu&s;ed to touch a weapon, till their grievances were re|moved.</P>
<P>Things being in this dangerous &s;ituation, the &s;enate were obliged to have recour&s;e to the old method of redre&s;s, by creating a dictator. Ap|pius, who advi&s;ed the mea&s;ure, hoped that he him&s;elf &s;hould have been cho&s;en, but the &s;enate,

&s;en&s;ible that &s;o much power in the hands of on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o violent in the u&s;e of that which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, would be dangerous, cho&s;e Marius Valerius, an ancient &s;enator, one mild, merciful, much loved by the people, and de&s;cended from the great deliverer, who&s;e name he bore. Valerius, who &s;ecretly inclined to the plebeian party, cho&s;e Quintus, the brother of their great idol, Servi|lius, for his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, and a&s;&s;embling the orders, a&s;&s;ured them, that if they would follow him freely, their grievances &s;hould not only be redre&s;&s;ed, but their fortunes advanced by the &s;poils of the enemy. He in the mean time freed them from any immediate pro&s;ecu|tions from their creditors, and commanded them to follow him to the field. There was &s;omething &s;o ab&s;olute in the office of a dictator, and it was &s;o much con&s;idered by the people, that they not only dreaded its re&s;entment, but &s;eemed to think its promi&s;es binding. They therefore enrolled them&s;elves at his order, and marching again&s;t the enemy, quickly reduced them to obedience, &s;uch lands as had been taken from them being divided among the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Upon his return, the dictator reque&s;ted the &s;e|nate to perform what he had &s;o &s;olemnly pledged his word to obtain; but Appius, &s;till ob&s;tinate, refu&s;ed to comply, reproaching him with a mean conde&s;cen&s;ion to the multitude, and bringing over the majority of the &s;enate to his opinion.
<PB N="83" REF="94">
Valerius therefore, finding he was unable to contend with &s;o powerful a body, laid down his office, alledging that it was time for an old man of &s;eventy, as he was, to think rather of ea&s;e than oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The people were now inflamed beyond all bearing; they entered into private con&s;ultations, and formed a plan of &s;eparating them&s;elves from ma&s;ters, who&s;e promi&s;es were as contemp|tible, as their tyranny dreadful. The mo&s;t vio|lent mea&s;ures are to the multitude always the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, and &s;ome had even the boldne&s;s to talk of killing &s;uch as were obnoxious. The &s;enate and the con&s;uls well knowing the effects of their fury when they &s;hould be di&s;banded, re&s;olved &s;till to keep them in the field, under pretence, that the enemy was yet un&s;ubdued, and preparing for new inva&s;ions. In this exi|gence the &s;oldiers were at a lo&s;s how to act; the military oath which they had taken upon li&s;ting, forbade their laying down their arms or for&s;aking their &s;tandards, and yet their recent injuries re&s;trained them from taking the field. They &s;teered between both extremes; they re|&s;olved to quit a city which gave them no &s;helter, and to form a new e&s;tabli&s;hment without its limits. They therefore removed their en&s;igns, changed their commanders, and under the con|duct of a plebeian named Sicinius Bellutus, they retired to a mountain, from thence called
<PB N="84" REF="95">
the Mons Sacer, on the banks of the river Anio, within about three miles from Rome.</P>
<P>Upon news of this defection, the city was filled with tumult and con&s;ternation; tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the army made all the attempts they could to &s;cale the walls in order to join it, for the gates were &s;hut by the &s;enate's direc|tion. The fathers, who had &s;ons among the mutineers, reproached their degeneracy, wives lamented the ab&s;ence of their hu&s;bands, and all apprehended a civil war. The &s;enate was not le&s;s agitated than the re&s;t: &s;ome were for vio|lent mea&s;ures and repelling force by force, others were of opinion, that gentler arts were to be u&s;ed, and that even a victory over &s;uch ene|mies, would be wor&s;e than a defeat. At length therefore, it was re&s;olved to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger, entreating the army to return home and declare their grievances, promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time an oblivion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed. This me&s;&s;age, which in fact was premature to be attended with any effect, was treated by the army with di&s;dain; &s;o that the &s;enate were now to begin afre&s;h to con&s;ider of the proper &s;teps to be taken, and whether force or conde&s;cen&s;ion was the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Accordingly, after chu&s;ing new con&s;uls (tho' not without difficulty, as none at fir&s;t would offer for the office) they entered upon the de|liberation, with an earne&s;tne&s;s equal to the im|portance
<PB N="85" REF="96">
of the cau&s;e. Menenius Agrippa, one of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the &s;enators, was of opinion, that the people were to be com|plied with; that the Roman Dominions could neither be extended or pre&s;erved without them. The late dictator Valerius &s;econded his opinion, with a warmth unu&s;ual to one of his advanced age. He upbraided the Senate with their du|plicity, and urged the nece&s;&s;ity of letting the people into a &s;hare of tho&s;e advantages which the rich &s;eemed willing to engro&s;s. Appius on the other hand, &s;till adhering to his principles, declaimed with great force again&s;t making the &s;malle&s;t conce&s;&s;ions to the multitude. He ob|&s;erved that if they granted to the people when enemies, what they had refu&s;ed them when friends, it would be an argument of their fears and not their ju&s;tice. That the young Patricians and their clients were &s;till able to defend the city, even though its ungrateful inhabitants &s;hould think fit to de&s;ert it: that the multitude never knows where to &s;top in its demands, and that every conce&s;&s;ion would be only productive of fre&s;h claims and louder importunities. The body of the &s;enators, to whom chiefly the people were debtors, only wanted the &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch arguments to cover their avarice; tho&s;e of the younger &s;ort al&s;o who were flattered by the orator, applauded his &s;peech with indecent zeal. The con&s;uls therefore, who notwith&s;tanding this
<PB N="86" REF="97">
&s;hew of a debate, &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity there was of complying with the people; in order to pre|vent &s;uch violent mea&s;ures as the &s;enate were ha&s;tening into, for that day broke up the a&s;|&s;embly, at the &s;ame time intimating to the younger part of the &s;enators, that if they did not behave with more moderation for the fu|ture, a law &s;hould be preferred, preventing all, under a certain age, from being admitted into the &s;enate for the future.</P>
<P>This threat did not want its effect at their next meeting, where, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tead|fa&s;t oppo&s;ition of Appius, and the terrible blow that was about to be given to the fortunes of many of the members, it was re&s;olved to enter into a treaty with the people, and to make them &s;uch offers as &s;hould induce them to return. Ten commi&s;&s;ioners were accordingly deputed, at the head of whom were Largius and Valerius, who had been dictators, and Menenius Agrippa, equally loved by the &s;enate and the people. The dignity and the popularity of the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors procured them a very re&s;pectable reception among the &s;oldiers, and a long conference be|gan between them; Largius and Valerius em|ployed all their oratory on the one hand, while Sicinius and Lucius Junius, who were the &s;poke&s;men of the &s;oldiery, aggravated their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, with all that male-eloquence which is the child of nature. The conference had now
<PB N="87" REF="98">
continued for a long time, when Menenius Agrippa, who had been originally a ple|beian him&s;elf, a &s;hrewd man, and who con&s;e|quently knew what kind of eloquence was mo&s;t likely to plea&s;e the people, addre&s;&s;ed them with that celebrated fable, which is &s;o finely told us by Livy. <Q>"In times of old, when every part of the body could think for it&s;elf, and each had a &s;e|parate will of its own, they all, with common con&s;ent, re&s;olved to revolt again&s;t the belly: they knew no rea&s;on, they &s;aid, why they &s;hould toil from morning till night in its &s;ervice, while the belly, in the mean time, lay at its ea&s;e in the mid&s;t of them all, and indolently grew fat upon their labours: accordingly, one and all, they agreed to befriend it no more. The feet vowed they would carry it no longer, the hands vowed they would feed it no longer, and the teeth averred they would not chew a mor&s;el of meat, though it were placed between them. Thus re&s;olved, they all, for &s;ome time, &s;hewed their &s;pirit, and kept their word; but &s;oon they found, that in&s;tead of mortifying the belly by the&s;e means, they only undid them&s;elves; they langui&s;hed for a while, and perceived, when too late, that it was owing to the belly, that they had &s;trength to work or courage to mutiny."</Q></P>
<P>This fable, the application of which is ob|vious, had an in&s;tantaneous effect upon the peo|ple. They unanimou&s;ly cried out, that Agrippa
<PB N="88" REF="99">
&s;hould lead them back to Rome, and were making preparations to follow him, when Ju|nius Brutus, before-mentioned, with-held them, alledging, that though they were gratefully to acknowledge the kind offers of the &s;enate, yet they had no &s;afe-guard for the future again&s;t their re&s;entment; that therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the people, to have certain officers created annually from among them|&s;elves, who &s;hould have power to give &s;uch of them as &s;hould be injured, redre&s;s, and plead the cau&s;e of the community.</P>
<P>The people, who are ever of opinion with the la&s;t &s;peaker, highly applauded this propo&s;al, which however the commi&s;&s;ioners had not power to comply with: they therefore &s;ent to Rome to take the in&s;tructions of the &s;enate, who, worried with divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, and harra&s;&s;ed by complaints from without, were re&s;olved to have peace, at what&s;oever price it &s;hould be obtained; accordingly, as if with one voice, they con&s;ented to the creation of their new officers, who were called <HI>Tribunes of the People,</HI> Appius alone prote&s;ting with vehemence again&s;t the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The tribunes of the people were at fir&s;t five in number, though afterwards their body was encrea&s;ed by five more. They were always an|nually elected by the people, and almo&s;t always from their body. They had the power of an|nulling
<PB N="89" REF="100">
all &s;uch decrees of the &s;enate, as they con&s;idered to lean upon the people; and to &s;hew their readine&s;s to protect the meane&s;t, their doors &s;tood open night and day, to receive their complaints. They at fir&s;t had their &s;eats placed before the doors of the &s;enate-hou&s;e, and being called in they were to examine every decree, annulling it by the word <HI>veto, I forbid it,</HI> or confirming it by &s;igning the letter <HI>T,</HI> which gave it its validity. Their per&s;ons were to be &s;acred, and though they were mark'd out by none of the en&s;igns of office, &s;uch as the curule chair, or the lictors which attended upon other magi&s;trates, yet their power was greatly &s;upe|rior, having a negative vote upon all decrees of the &s;enate. They were however to have no au|thority without the walls of the city, and it was unlawful for them to be ab&s;ent from it a day; but what &s;till mo&s;t dimini&s;hed their au|thority was, that any one of their number could put a negative upon the mea&s;ures of the re&s;t, and this was afterwards found the mo&s;t artful method of oppo&s;ing them, for one gained over to the &s;enate, rendered the attempts of the re&s;t abortive. This new office therefore being thus in&s;tituted, Sicinius Bellutus, Lucius Junius, Caius Licinius, Albinus, and Icilius Ruga were the fir&s;t tribunes that were cho&s;en by the &s;uffrages of the people. The &s;enate al&s;o made an edict confirming the abolition of debts, and
<PB N="90" REF="101">
now all things being adju&s;ted both on the one &s;ide and the other, the people, after having &s;a|crificed to the Gods of the mountain, returned back once more in triumph to Rome.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. From the creation of the tribunes to the appoint|ment of the decemviri.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="260" UNIT="U. C."> WE have hitherto &s;een the people &s;truggling again&s;t the exorbitant power of the &s;enate, but we now begin a period, in which the &s;enate are &s;truggling again&s;t the encrea&s;ing power of the people; a period, in which the latter beginning to feel theit own force, and being put into mo|tion, bear all down before them with irre&s;i&s;tible violence. The fir&s;t advantage the tribunes ob|tained, was a permi&s;&s;ion to chu&s;e from among the people, two annual officers as a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the fatigues of their duty. The&s;e were caled aediles, as a part of their bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in taking care of the public buildings, aqueducts and &s;ewers; and likewi&s;e in determining &s;ome cau&s;es, that had hitherto been determinable by the con|&s;uls only. They were to remark tho&s;e who held more land than the laws allowed them; to curb all public immoralities, and aboli&s;h nui&s;ances; to provide corn and oil in times of famine, and
<PB N="91" REF="102">
to prevent any monopolies that might be made by the purcha&s;ers of the&s;e commodities. The people having obtained the&s;e privileges, and all their clamours being appea&s;ed, now marched again&s;t the Vo&s;ci and Antiates, took Corioli, one of their chief towns, and &s;oon after over|threw the enemy with great &s;laughter. In this battle Martius, after &s;urnamed Coriolanus, par|ticularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The people being thus rendered more turbu|lent by the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the &s;enate, and by a triumph over the enemy, had &s;oon after fre&s;h opportunity to &s;hew their aptitude to clamour. During the late &s;eparation, all tillage had been entirely neglected, and a famine was the con&s;e|quence the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. The &s;enate did all that lay in their power to remedy the di&s;tre&s;s, but the people pinched with want, and willing to throw the blame on any but them&s;elves, a&s;cribed the whole of their di&s;tre&s;s, to the avarice of the patricians, who having purcha&s;ed up all the corn, as was alledged, intended to indem|nify them&s;elves for the abolition of debts, by &s;elling it out at great advantage; but this was not all they were charged with. The &s;enate, in order to le&s;&s;en the number of citizens in this time of famine, had &s;ent many of them to Veli|tra, a city of the Vol&s;cians, that had lately been much depopulated by a plague. This excited an univer&s;al clamour among the people, which
<PB N="92" REF="103">
the tribunes took care to encrea&s;e. This they &s;aid was only an artful method of getting rid of &s;uch citizens as were obnoxious to the nobles; it was little el&s;e than bani&s;hing the brave&s;t men of the &s;tate without an offence, and thus by weakening the &s;trength of the people, to en|crea&s;e their own. The&s;e reports being indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly propagated, an a&s;&s;embly was called, in which the con&s;uls and the tribunes, by turns, ha|rangued the people. A conte&s;t managed with &s;o much impetuo&s;ity on both &s;ides, every mo|ment grew warmer, the con&s;uls in&s;i&s;ted, that the tribunes had no right to addre&s;s the a&s;&s;em|bly; the tribunes, on the other hand a&s;&s;erted, that their office was &s;acred, and that they ought to &s;uffer no interruption in their duty. In this the people unanimou&s;ly concurred, for what|ever their leaders thought fit to propo&s;e, they were ready to ratify; a law therefore was made, that no man &s;hould dare to interrupt the tri|bunes while they &s;poke to the people, a law which greatly encrea&s;ed their power, as now, from taking the a&s;&s;embly's in&s;tructions, they were authorized to direct them.</P>
<P>The city, after this enjoyed a tran&s;ient calm, &s;ome of the people retired to their hou&s;es to &s;upport famine with patience and re&s;ignation, while others made incur&s;ions upon the enemy, and returned with the &s;poil. But abundance, &s;oon after, renewed in them that turbulence,
<PB N="93" REF="104">
which the continuance of the famine had ap|pea&s;ed, but not removed. A large fleet of &s;hips laden with corn from Sicily (a great part of which was a pre&s;ent from Gelon, the king of that country, to the Romans, and the re&s;t pur|cha&s;ed by the &s;enate with the public money) rai&s;ed their &s;pirits once more, and enflamed their eagerne&s;s for di&s;&s;en&s;ion. When it came to be debated in the &s;enate, in what manner this large &s;upply &s;hould be di&s;tributed, violent divi&s;ions aro&s;e. Some were for letting the poorer &s;ort have a &s;ufficient quantity for nothing, others were for &s;elling it at a low price, and thus re|imbur&s;e the trea&s;ury; but when it came to the turn of Coriolanus to &s;peak, he in&s;i&s;ted, that no part of it &s;hould be di&s;tributed, until the late inva&s;ions which the people had made upon the rights of the &s;enate &s;hould be re&s;tored, and until the commonwealth was reduced to its former regularity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, cried he, do we bear to &s;ee the &s;tate divided between two powers, who&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions only &s;erve to harra&s;s it the more? Can we tamely bear to &s;ee tribunes give laws in Rome, and rule with uncontroled power, when we could not &s;toop to kings? If the factious and turbulent are unwilling to live at Rome, let them retire once more to their mountain; it is better not to govern, if we mu&s;t &s;hare our command with the dregs of the people."</Q> A &s;peech &s;o inflammatory, and
<PB N="94" REF="105">
a mea&s;ure &s;o violent, rekindled all the flames of di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The multitude, in the violence of their re&s;entment, would have fallen upon the &s;enate it&s;elf, but the tribunes re&s;trained their fury, and only pointed it upon Coriolanus, whom they devoted to de&s;truction. Coriolanus however, &s;till remained un&s;haken, nature had made him bold, frugal, and inflexible, and to the&s;e he added the acquired virtues of great re&s;pect for the laws, great knowledge of war, and an immoderate regard for his country, or rather that part of it who&s;e quarrel he e&s;pou&s;ed. He accordingly treated the &s;ummons of the tri|bunes, to appear before them, with contempt. They therefore next &s;ent their aediles to appre|hend and bring him before the people; but a party of the young patricians gathered round their favourite, repul&s;ed the aediles, and having beaten, drove them away. This was a &s;ignal for univer&s;al uproar, the tumult encrea&s;ed from every quarter, and a civil war threatened to en&s;ue, had not the con&s;uls promi&s;ed the people the mo&s;t ample redre&s;s. The tribunes in&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould be thrown headlong from the Tarpeian Rock, as a rebel and a contemner of the &s;acred authority of the Roman people, and and condemned him, even without demanding the &s;uffrages of the people. They were going once more to lay hold on his per&s;on, but the patricians again re&s;cued him. A conduct &s;o re|&s;olute
<PB N="95" REF="106">
on one &s;ide, and &s;o a&s;&s;uming on the other, in &s;ome mea&s;ure put the populace in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; they were afraid to a&s;&s;i&s;t the tribunes again&s;t tho&s;e who had been their generals and captains, and gazed upon the conte&s;t with trembling irre&s;olution. Their backwardne&s;s therefore, to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance, began to rai&s;e &s;u&s;|picions in the tribunes, that they had proceeded with too much violence; they, in con&s;equence, demanded to bring his trial before the a&s;&s;embly of the people, and that his ca&s;e &s;hould be ar|gued before that authority, from which there lay no appeal. The patricians, who, though con&s;cious of the innocence of Coriolanus, were yet willing to give peace to the city, con&s;ented, and a day was appointed for making his defence. Coriolanus demanded of the tribunes, what they intended to charge him with; to which they replied, that they intended to accu&s;e him of aiming at &s;overeignty and tyranny, where|upon he chearfully put him&s;elf upon trial, con|&s;cious of his innocence of the charge.</P>
<P>When the appointed day was come, all per|&s;ons were filled with the greate&s;t expectation, and a va&s;t concour&s;e from the adjacent country a&s;&s;embled and filled up the Forum. The tri|bunes, in the mean time, divided the people by tribes, &s;eparating them with cords from each other, and ordering that they &s;hould give their votes &s;eparately, and not by centuries, as
<PB N="96" REF="107">
&s;ince the time of Ho&s;tilius had always been the cu&s;tom. This, as we have remarked before, was depriving the patricians of all their influence, &s;ince the numbers of the populace were &s;ure to prevail; however, the &s;enate, unwilling to make the cau&s;e of Coriolanus their own, at la&s;t con|&s;ented to this &s;tretch of power in the plebeian: But, to make a &s;hew of defending him to the la&s;t, one of the con&s;uls mounted the ro&s;trum in his favour, declaring what actions of &s;ervice he had done the &s;tate; how little, a few words e&s;caping in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, ought to be attended to; he &s;ignified, that the whole &s;enate were petitioners in his cau&s;e, and de&s;ired the tribunes, that they would keep wholly to their threatened impeachment, namely, his aim|ing at the &s;overeign power. To this, Sicinus, the tribune replied, that he would urge again&s;t the guilty, all things, of every kind, that could tend to prove him guilty; that the &s;tate had too much to fear from his influence, and his number of clients, not to u&s;e every means of bringing him to ju&s;tice. That he owed much more to the &s;afety of the &s;tate, than to any vain com|plai&s;ance to the &s;enate; and that the very at|tempt to depre&s;s the power of the people, who had all the rights of humanity to govern them|&s;elves, was a crime. Coriolanus, upon this, pre|&s;ented him&s;elf before the people, with a degree of intrepidity that merited better fortune. His
<PB N="97" REF="108">
graceful per&s;on, his per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, the cries of tho&s;e whom he had &s;aved from the enemy, enclined the auditors to relent; he be|gan by recounting all the battles he had fought, and the various po&s;ts he had &s;u&s;tained; he &s;hewed the various crowns which had been given him by his generals, as rewards of merit, and expo&s;ed to view the numberle&s;s wounds he had received in acquiring them; he related all the breaches he had entered, and all the lives he had &s;aved, calling out to &s;uch as were pre&s;ent, to bear witne&s;s to the truth of his recital. The&s;e, with the mo&s;t moving prote&s;tations, en|treated their fellows to &s;pare that life by which they lived, and if there mu&s;t be an offering for public re&s;entment, they them&s;elves were ready to die for him. A defence like this, &s;upported with all that boldne&s;s which con&s;cious inno|cence in&s;pires, moved every hearer to think of pardon; many cried out, that &s;o brave a man de&s;erved a triumph not death, and that his very trial was a national reproach. The giddy mul|titude were going therefore to ab&s;olve him, when Decius, one of the tribunes, a man of fluent eloquence, ro&s;e up to reply. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"However, cried he, we may be prevented by the &s;enate from urging tho&s;e &s;peeches which were made among&s;t that augu&s;t body, tending to de&s;troy the privileges of the people, yet &s;till we are not uprovided; we decline aggravating what

In a late incur&s;ion into the territories of Antium, though his plun|der, both in &s;laves, cattle, and provi&s;ions, was very great, yet the publick were neither the better nor the richer for it: it was di|vided only among his friends and followers, men, whom probably he only intended to enrich, to be the better able to &s;ecure our ruin. It has ever been the practice of ty|rants to begin the work of ambition, by forming a numerous body of partizans, who are willing to lo&s;e public regard in private emolument. Here then we ground our charge, let him, if he can, deny the fact, and let him bring proofs, not by vainly &s;hewing his &s;cars, but by convincing us of his innocence."</Q> This charge was entirely unexpected, Coriolanus had, in fact, when the people refu&s;ed to li&s;t, i&s;&s;ued out at the head of his clients, and plundered the enemy, who had the in&s;olence of making incur&s;ions to the very
<PB N="99" REF="110">
walls of Rome. The&s;e &s;poils which were &s;o ju&s;tly earned, he never thought of bringing into the trea&s;ury, as they were the acqui&s;ition of a private adventure. Being therefore unable to an&s;wer what was alledged again&s;t him to the &s;atisfaction of the people, and utterly con|founded with the charge, the tribunes imme|diately took the votes, and Coriolanus was con|demned to perpetual exile.</P>
<P>Never did the populace te&s;tify a &s;incerer joy, even in triumphing over a vanqui&s;hed enemy, than they did on this occa&s;ion, having in a manner totally controlled the power of the &s;e|nate, &s;ince henceforward they a&s;&s;umed a right of &s;ummoning any of the individuals of that body before them, whom they thought proper to accu&s;e. The &s;enate, on the other hand, &s;aw them&s;elves reduced to an abject dependance upon the multitude, deprived of all &s;ecurity for their per&s;ons, and all their former rights of being judged by each other. This &s;entence again&s;t their brave&s;t defender &s;truck their whole body with &s;orrow, con&s;ternation, and regret. Corio|lanus alone, in the mid&s;t of this tumult, &s;eemed an unconcerned &s;pectator. He returned home, followed by the lamentations of hundreds of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;enators and citizens of Rome, in order to take a la&s;ting leave of his wife, his children, and his mother Veturia. While they, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of &s;orrow,
<PB N="100" REF="111">
hung round him, as loath to part, he, with a manly fortitude, tore him&s;elf from their em|braces; he exhorted them to bear their fate with fortitude, but to think of him no more. Thus recommending his little children to their care, and all to the care of heaven, he left the city, without followers or fortune, to take re|fuge among the enemies of Rome. Thus the plebeians, who had obtained tribunes merely for their own defence, employed tho&s;e very ma|gi&s;trates to annoy others, and by in&s;en&s;ible de|grees, &s;tript the patricians of all their former privileges.</P>
<P>Coriolanus, now obliged to wander, &s;ought le&s;s for a retreat from Rome, than for an op|portunity of vengeance. All his fortitude, and the early in&s;titutions of his mother were not able to repre&s;s the re&s;entment of his wrongs, or his de&s;ire of puni&s;hing his enemies, even though it involved the ruin of his country. Tullus Attius, a man of great power among the Vol&s;ci, and a violent enemy of the Romans, &s;eemed to him a fit in&s;trument to a&s;&s;i&s;t his revenge. Re|&s;olving to apply to him, he enters Antium, the city where Tullus commanded, by night, and going directly to his hou&s;e, &s;eated him&s;elf near the hearth, by the hou&s;hold gods, a place, which among the heathens was held &s;acred. Tullus being informed, that a &s;tranger, with an all of dignity far beyond what was common,
<PB N="101" REF="112">
had taken refuge in his hou&s;e, came and de|manded his name and bu&s;ine&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My name, cried the Roman, is Caius Marcius: my &s;ur|name is Coriolanus, the only reward that remains of all my &s;ervices. I am bani&s;h|ed Rome for being a friend to it; I am come to take refuge here, where I have ever been a declared enemy. If you are willing to make u&s;e of my &s;ervices, you &s;hall find me grateful; if you are willing to re|venge the injuries I have done, behold me in your power."</Q> Tullus, &s;truck with his dig|nity and known courage, in&s;tantly gave him the hand of friend&s;hip, and e&s;pou&s;ed his quarrel. The fir&s;t thing therefore to be done, was to in|duce the Vol&s;ci to break the league which had been made with Rome; and for this purpo&s;e, Tullus &s;ent many of his citizens to Rome, in order to &s;ee &s;ome games at that time celebrat|ing, but in the mean time gave the &s;enate pri|vate information, that the &s;trangers had dange|rous intentions of burning the city. This had the de&s;ired effect, the &s;enate i&s;&s;ued an order, that all &s;trangers, whoever they were, &s;hould depart from Rome before &s;un-&s;et. This order Tullus repre&s;ented to his countrymen as an in|fraction of the treaty, and procured an emba&s;&s;y to Rome, complaining of the breach, and rede|manding all the territories belonging to the Vol&s;cians, of which they had been violently
<PB N="102" REF="113">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, declaring war in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al. This me&s;&s;age was treated by the &s;enate with contempt; they bade the Amba&s;&s;adors inform their countrymen, that menaces were not the way to prevail with Rome; that they would keep with their &s;words tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which their valour had won, and &s;hould the Vol&s;cians be the fir&s;t to take up arms, the Romans would be the la&s;t to lay them down.</P>
<P>War being thus declared on both &s;ides, Corio|lanus and Tullus were made generals of the Vol&s;cians, and accordingly invaded the Roman territories, ravaging and laying wa&s;te all &s;uch lands as belonged to the plebeians, but letting tho&s;e of the &s;enators remain untouched. In the mean time, the levies went on but &s;lowly at Rome; the two con&s;uls, who were re&punc;elected by the people, &s;eemed but little &s;killed in war, and even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eared to encounter a general, whom they knew to be their &s;uperior in the field. The allies al&s;o &s;hewed their fears, and &s;lowly brought in their &s;uccours, &s;o that Coriolanus continued to take their towns one after the other. Circaeum, a Roman colony, fir&s;t &s;ub|mitted to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s arms; he then attacked the La|tins, who vainly implored a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Rome. The towns of Tolerium, Lavici, Pes, and Bola, were all taken by &s;torm, their goods plundered, and the inhabitants made pri&s;oners of war; &s;uch as yield<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d were treated mildly; &s;uch as re&s;i&s;ted

were put to the &s;word: fortune followed him in every expedition, and he was now &s;o famous for his victories, that the Vol&s;ci left their towns defencele&s;s, to follow him into the field, being a&s;&s;ured, under his conduct, of &s;ucce&s;s. The very &s;oldiers of his colleague's army came over to him, and would acknowledge no other general. Thus finding him&s;elf unoppo&s;ed in the field, and at the head of a numerous army, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e at length pitched his camp at the Cluilian ditch, within five miles of Rome. Nothing now was to be &s;een in the city that had lately been &s;o turbulent, but timidity and de&s;pair. The people, who from their walls beheld the enemy ravaging their fields, begged peace with tears and &s;upplications. They now began to entreat the &s;enate to recal the edict which had bani&s;hed Coriolanus, and acknowledged the in|ju&s;tice of their former proceedings. The &s;enate however, de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch meanne&s;s, re&s;olving if po&s;&s;ible, not to betray the inju&s;tice of the &s;tate to foreign enemies, or to grant tho&s;e favours to a traitor, which they had denied him when but accu&s;ed of being &s;o. Yet what could their re&s;olutions avail, when they had not power to &s;upport them. Coriolanus approached nearer every day, and at la&s;t inve&s;ted the city, fully re&s;olved to be&s;iege it. It was then that the fierce &s;pirit of the patricians was entirely &s;ub|dued, both &s;enate and people unanimou&s;ly
<PB N="104" REF="115">
agreed to &s;end deputies to him with propo&s;als of a re&s;toration, in ca&s;e he &s;hould draw off his army. Coriolanus received their propo&s;als at the head of his principal officers, and with the &s;ternne&s;s of a general that was to give the law. He, with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, informed them, that he was now general of the Vol&s;cians, and had only their intere&s;t to con&s;ider: that if they hoped for peace, they mu&s;t re&s;tore all the towns which originally belonged to that people, and make them free of the city, as the Latins were; and that he would give them thirty days to con&s;ider of it. The intermediate time he em|ployed in taking &s;everal other towns from the Latins, at the end of which he returned, and again encamped his army before the walls of Rome.</P>
<P>Another emba&s;&s;y was now &s;ent forth, con|juring him not to exact from his native city, aught but what became Romans to grant. Co|riolanus however, naturally inflexible and &s;evere, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his former demands, and grant|ed them but three days, in which to fini&s;h their deliberations. A me&s;&s;age &s;o peremptory, filled the whole town with con&s;ternation. Every one now ran to take arms, &s;ome po&s;ted them&s;elves upon the ramparts, others watched the gates, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;ecretly delivered by parti|zans which Coriolanus had within; others for|tified their hou&s;es, as if the enemy were already

ma&s;ters of the walls. In this general confu&s;ion, there was neither di&s;cipline nor command. The con&s;uls, who&s;e fears only were their advi&s;ers, had been elected for very different merits, than tho&s;e of &s;kill in war. The tribunes, lately &s;o fierce, were now no more heard of, all &s;hared the univer&s;al terror, and it &s;eemed as if the boa&s;ted courage of Rome, had gone over with their general, into the camp of the Vol&s;cians. In this exigence, all that &s;eemed left them, was another deputation &s;till more &s;olemn than either of the former, compo&s;ed of the pontiffs, the prie&s;ts, and the augurs. The&s;e, cloathed in their habits of ceremony, and with a grave and mournful deportment, i&s;&s;ued from the city, and entered the camp of the conqueror: they be|&s;ought him by all that was &s;acred, by the re|&s;pect he owed the gods, and that which he might have for tho&s;e, who being &s;ervants of the gods, were now at his feet, to give peace to his country; but all in vain, they found him &s;evere and inflexible as before. He te&s;ti|fied that re&s;pect for them, which the &s;anctity of their characters demanded, but &s;ent them away without relaxing in any of his demands.</P>
<P>When the people &s;aw them return ineffectu|ally, they began to give up the commonwealth as lo&s;t. Their temples were filled with old men, with women and children, who, pro&s;trate at their altars, put up their ardent prayers for
<PB N="106" REF="117">
the pre&s;ervation of their country. Nothing was to be heard but angui&s;h and lamentation, no|thing to be &s;een but &s;cenes of affright and di&s;|tre&s;s. At length it was &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that what could not be effected by the interce&s;&s;ion of the &s;enate, or the adjuration of the prie&s;ts, might be brought about by the tears of his wife, or the commands of his mother. This deputation &s;eemed to be reli&s;hed by all, and even the &s;enate it&s;elf gave it the &s;anction of their authority. Veturia, the mother of Corio|lanus, at fir&s;t made &s;ome he&s;itation to under|take &s;o pious a work, knowing the inflexible temper of her &s;on, and fearing only to &s;hew his di&s;obedience in a new point of light, by reject|ing the commands of a parent: however, &s;he undertook the emba&s;&s;y, and &s;et forward from the city, accompanied by many of the prin|cipal matrons of Rome, with Volumnia his wife, and his two children. Coriolanus, who at a di&s;tance di&s;covered this mournful train of females, was re&s;olved to give them a denial, and called his officers round him, to be witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;olution: but when told, that his mother and his wife were among the number, he in|&s;tantly came down from his tribunal, to meet and embrace them. At fir&s;t, the womens tears and embraces took away the power of words, and the rough &s;oldier him&s;elf, hard as he was, could not refrain from &s;haring in their di&s;tre&s;s.

Tullus, who had long envyed his glory, was not remi&s;s in aggravating the lenity of his conduct to his countrymen.

<P>Great and many were the public rejoicings at Rome, upon the retreat of the Vol&s;cian army. The &s;enate decreed to grant the women what honours they &s;hould demand, but they only a&s;ked to have a temple dedicated to Female Fortune, built in the place where they had delivered their country, which was accordingly erected at the public charge. In the mean time, that courage which had been for a time over|powered, began again to &s;hew it&s;elf in the field. Coriolanus being no more, they ventured to face their Vol&s;cian enemies, who indeed contri|buted by their own contentions, together with that of their allies, to render any foreign force in a manner unnece&s;&s;ary to their overthrow. A &s;ignal victory was obtained over them, and the Hernici the year en&s;uing. Among others, Tul|lus their general was &s;lain.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="120">
Spurius Ca&s;&s;ius Vi&s;cellinus had the principal honour in obtaining this victory. He was a man naturally vain, and filled with o&s;tentation: ambitious to an extreme, and as ready to over|rate his own &s;ervices, as to undervalue tho&s;e of another. He had been three times con&s;ul, and had been decreed two triumphs by the &s;enate; the&s;e advantages added, to &s;ome po|pularity, rai&s;ed his pride to a&s;pire at being king of Rome. In order to prepare for this, being impowered by the &s;enate to give the conquered nations what conditions of peace he &s;hould think proper, he re&s;olved to attach them to his intere&s;ts by the mo&s;t flattering conce&s;&s;ions. He therefore gave them back a third of what he had conquered; he granted them the title of citizens of Rome, and treated the vanqui&s;hed, in all re&s;pects, as he would have done a victo|rious army. To make friends in every part of the &s;tate, he gave the Latins one moiety of the conquer'd lands remaining, and re&s;erved the other part for the poor citizens of Rome. Not content with this, he was re&s;olved to encrea&s;e his popularity by di&s;tributing among the poor &s;ome lands which had long been in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the rich, and which he a&s;&s;erted to be the property of the publick. Accordingly, on the day &s;ucceeding that of his triumph, giving an account, according to cu&s;tom, of what he had done, he expatiated upon his extraordinary
<PB N="110" REF="121">
care and wi&s;e management of the common|wealth; on his having encrea&s;ed the &s;ubjects and citizens of Rome, and on his own peculiar endowments for guiding the &s;tate; he went on to ob&s;erve, that hower exten&s;ive the conque&s;ts of Rome might be, it &s;ignified but little, if the rich only enjoyed the advantages of them; if that while the &s;enate and patricians lived in affluence, the veteran &s;oldier pined in want and ob&s;curity. He therefore was of opinion, that an exact e&s;timate &s;hould be made of all the lands taken from the enemy, which were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rich, and that they &s;hould be equally divided among the lower citizens. This was the original of the famous Agrarian law, which afterwards cau&s;ed &s;uch di&s;turbances among the people. Nothing could exceed the indignation of the &s;enate upon hearing it pro|po&s;ed; as they had before been almo&s;t &s;tript of their public rights, they &s;aw this attacked them in their private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: all that for|tune which their ance&s;tors or them&s;elves had ac|quired by valour or indu&s;try, was now de&s;tined to be plundered from them, to be di&s;tributed among the indolent, the extravagant, and the ba&s;e. One deliberation &s;ucceeded upon another to concert mea&s;ures how to fru&s;trate the effects of this law, and the ambition of Ca&s;&s;ius. The people were not le&s;s mutinous on their part; the tribunes, and tho&s;e who&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="122">
fortunes were above the lowe&s;t rank were un|willing to be reduced to a level with the mean|e&s;t of tho&s;e they pretended to direct: the clients of the rich were attached to the intere&s;t of their patrons; but notwith&s;tanding this, the majority of the multitude, with Ca&s;&s;ius at their head, &s;trenuou&s;ly clamoured for the Agrarian law, and threatened de&s;truction to the empire, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. Even &s;everal of the Hernici and Vol&s;ci were called in on this occa&s;ion to en|crea&s;e the tumult, or to bring off the propo&s;er, in ca&s;e of failure. At la&s;t, the &s;enate perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of complying, and therefore gave the populace a promi&s;e, that the lands &s;hould be divided among them according to their de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ire; but that the allies and a&s;&s;ociates, who had no part in acquiring tho&s;e lands, &s;hould have no &s;hare in the divi&s;ion. This promi&s;e at pre|&s;ent appea&s;ed the people, and gave the &s;enate an opportunity of concerting mea&s;ures for puni&s;hing the original propo&s;er. Accord|ingly, &s;ome time after, the que&s;tors, by their order, appointed a day for Ca&s;&s;ius to an|&s;wer to the charge of his de&s;igning to become king, before the a&s;&s;embly of the people. A blow &s;o unexpected alarmed this demagogue with the mo&s;t ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions, particularly, as he had the tribunes as well as the patricians again&s;t him. He appeared before the a&s;&s;embly habited in a manner becoming his &s;ituation,
<PB N="112" REF="123">
and attempted to intere&s;t the people in his fa|vour. He alledged, that he was per&s;ecuted in this manner by the patricians, for his zeal in their cau&s;e; that he was their only &s;urviving friend, and that their intere&s;ts were combined with his. But he found him&s;elf de&s;erted by all. The &s;enate had the ju&s;te&s;t rea&s;on to pur&s;ue him; the tribunes envying him his &s;hare of popularity, neglected to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and the multi|tude plea&s;ed with the patricians for their late compliance with their demands, gave him up to their fury, who was the promoter of them. Being therefore found guilty of a number of crimes, all tending toward altering the con&s;ti|tution, notwith&s;tanding his many real &s;ervices, and the interce&s;&s;ion of his friends and clients, in mourning, he was thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock, by tho&s;e very people, who&s;e in|tere&s;ts he had endeavoured to extend. It was too late that they perceived their error, and be|gan to regret their champion with a degree of &s;orrow, that but argued their ingratitude.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="274" UNIT="U.

The people however at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to enli&s;t, till the con&s;uls hitting upon a new expedient, ordered all the country hou&s;es of the recu&s;ants to be levelled

with the ground. This had the de&s;ired effect, numbers came to offer them&s;elves, to &s;ave their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from de&s;truction, and were led again&s;t the enemy, with the u&s;ual good fortune of Rome. Thus, while the conte&s;ts continued in the city, the Roman arms made continual pro|gre&s;s in Italy; for that &s;pirit of liberty which animated both parties, only contributed to en|flame their courage.</P>
<P>The&s;e dilatory arts continued for near five years on the part of the &s;enate, and as ob&s;tinate a &s;pirit of clamour on that of the people: the one having their private intere&s;ts, as well as tho&s;e of the publick to engage them; the other having a promi&s;e given, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own &s;uperior power, to encrea&s;e their ob|&s;tinacy. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e troubles, the Ro|mans received a &s;ignal defeat, under the con|duct of Virginius, one of their con&s;uls, from the Hetrurian army, and though Fabius came very opportunely to his relief, yet upon his retreat, the enemy made incur&s;ions, even to the walls of Rome. This &s;erved to encrea&s;e the di&s;con|tents and the animo&s;ities of the citizens, the &s;e|nators &s;till witholding their promi&s;e, and the people refu&s;ing to enli&s;t. In &s;uch an extremity, the family of the Fabii, to the number of four thou&s;and men, offered to defend the frontiers of the Roman territories. They built a ca&s;tle nigh the borders of the enemy, and making fre|quent

incur&s;ions, greatly enriched them&s;elves by the &s;poil. It will not comport with the bre|vity of this work, to relate all the minute tran&s;|actions, and battles without con&s;equence which attended the&s;e wars between Rome and the&s;e little &s;tates round her. It will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that they all ended with the &s;ame good fortune, namely, the enemies begging peace, and the exten&s;ion of the territories of Rome. The Fabii however, were le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, being all cut off to a man by an ambu&s;cade, which was laid for them by the people of Veii. Of this noble family, one only &s;urvived, who&s;e po&s;teri|ty became afterwards equally &s;erviceable to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But not the territories alone of Rome were encrea&s;ed, during the&s;e times of war and civil <MILESTONE N="277" UNIT="U. C."> commotion, her citizens al&s;o became more nu|merous. In the enumeration of this year, they were found to amount to one hundred and ele|ven thou&s;and men, fit to bear arms, with treble that number of women, children, and &s;laves. This encrea&s;e of people, without commerce, only tended to advance the di&s;turbances of the city. Every year produced &s;ome new tumult between the contending orders of the &s;tate. The people, now become the electors of the magi&s;|trates, had not &s;kill or integrity to fix upon capable men, and &s;carce did any con&s;ul lay down his office, but the multitude were fore|mo&s;t

to accu&s;e his remi&s;ne&s;s or incapacity. It was in this manner that they accu&s;ed Menenius, their con&s;ul, for &s;uffering the family of the Fabii to be cut off; he was indeed an un&s;kilful gene|ral, but he was at the &s;ame time innocent of the charge laid again&s;t him. This however, did not avail, he was fined about twenty crowns, a &s;um, which though moderate in modern e&s;timation, he was unable to pay, he therefore, in dete&s;ta|tion of the inju&s;tice and ingratitude of his fel|low citizens, &s;hut him&s;elf up in his own hou&s;e, and &s;tarved him&s;elf to death.</P>
<P>The year following, the two con&s;uls of the former year, Manlius and Fabius were in the &s;ame manner cited by the tribunes to appear before the people. The Agrarian law was the object invariably pur&s;ued, and they were accu&s;ed of having made unju&s;tifiable delays in putting it off. The &s;ame per&s;everance on one &s;ide, and ob&s;tinacy on the other, again &s;et the city in a ferment, and threatened de&s;truction to one of the parties, when Genutius the Tribune, who had revived the law, was found dead in his bed, though without any marks of violence. A cir|cum&s;tance like this, which &s;hould have awakened the &s;u&s;picions of the people, only &s;erved to al|larm their &s;uper&s;titions; they began to think the gods were again&s;t their cau&s;e, and &s;howed &s;ymptoms of returning to their former obedi|ence. The con&s;uls, in order to avail them&s;elves
<PB N="116" REF="127">
of this lucky occa&s;ion, began to make fre&s;h le|vies, for it was now become the &s;ettled policy of the times, to draw off the peccant humours of the people by leading them to war; wherefore, mounting their tribunals, and being attended by their lictors, they continued to enrol the citizens with &s;ucce&s;s, till coming to one Volero, a centurion, who refu&s;ed to be enli&s;ted as a pri|vate centinel, they ordered him to be &s;tripped and &s;courged. This injudicious &s;everity not only rekindled the people's re&s;entment, but after|wards produced a new cau&s;e of contention con|cerning the power of the con&s;uls, and the privi|leges of the people. The pri&s;oner was re&s;cued by the multitude, the magi&s;trates driven off, and &s;till, to compleat their mortification, &s;oon after, Volero was made one of the tribunes of the people.</P>
<P>The election of this demagogue &s;eemed very injurious to the patrician party; he was not only re&s;olved upon carrying the Agrarian law, but al&s;o upon enacting another, in which the people &s;hould give their votes by tribes, and not by their curiae or their centuries. This was another mortal blow to the patrician power; for, as when the people voted by centuries, the patricians were entire ma&s;ters of the conte&s;t, and when by curiae, in which only the inhabi|tants of the city voted, they al&s;o, from their number of clients, had the majority of voices;
<PB N="117" REF="128">
&s;o now, when by this law all freemen of Rome, from whatever part of its territories they came, &s;hould be admitted to give a &s;ingle vote, equal to that of the fir&s;t &s;enator, all influence was entirely lo&s;t, and the patricians had nothing to do but to remain pa&s;&s;ive. It was therefore at fir&s;t &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the &s;enate, and as warmly urged by the people. In this conte&s;t, <MILESTONE N="282" UNIT="U. C."> Appius Claudius, the con&s;ul, &s;on to the former Appius, by a &s;ort of hereditary hatred to the people, was among the foremo&s;t. In one of their public a&s;&s;emblies he oppo&s;ed their de&s;igns &s;o warmly, and &s;o ju&s;tly expo&s;ed the turbulent tempers of the tribunes, that they ordered him to depart the a&s;&s;embly, and upon his refu&s;al, to be &s;ent to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>A &s;tretch of power &s;o great a&s;toni&s;hed all the &s;enators who were pre&s;ent; they offered to take arms in his defence, and as the people had in the former ca&s;e beaten off the lictors, &s;o they were in this driven off by the patricians. This &s;eemed the &s;ignal for a new tumult; &s;tones, torches, and every weapon that fury could furni&s;h, in a place where the citizens never carried arms, were employed again&s;t each other. But Quintius, the other con&s;ul, of a mild and peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, throw|ing him&s;elf into the mid&s;t of the combatants, entreating and be&s;eeching &s;ome, and menac|ing others, for that night a&s;&s;uaged their mu|tual
<PB N="118" REF="129">
animo&s;ity. Their tumults however, were renewed the day following, with more than former fury: Appius, with all his native fiercene&s;s, charging at the head of his clients, and other young patricians. But Lectorius, the tribune, with an immen&s;e multitude of the lower part of the people, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Capitol, where they fortified them&s;elves, &s;eem|ingly determined to hold it out again&s;t their oppo&s;ers. Their conduct now &s;eemed &s;till more re&s;olute than in the former defection of the army to mount Aventine; for, as in that, the in&s;urgents were at a di&s;tance from Rome, in this, they were in the very heart of the city. The appea&s;ing of this tumult was re&s;erved for Quintius al&s;o, who obtained, by his gentle re|mon&s;trances, to have the law referred to the &s;enate, which after many debates, which form, rather than uncertainty might have dictated, re|&s;olved, that the tribunes and the people were to be gratified, and that the law was to be enacted without delay. It was pa&s;t by the con&s;ent of all the orders, and the officers of the people were elected from henceforward by the tribes. Thus the people by degrees left the patricians nothing but the &s;hadow of power, of even which the multitude, now taught the art of uniting, were re&s;olved to deprive them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Appius, as from the for|mer part of his conduct, we may well &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="130">
was far from being di&s;po&s;ed to concur in this new conce&s;&s;ion of power: he that bore the people a contempt, that rather &s;eemed effect of habit than of rea&s;on, and inveighed again&s;t the &s;enate's pu&s;ilanimity. Nor were the people ig|norant of this, but de&s;ired an occa&s;ion of &s;hew|ing their re&s;entment, for which an opportunity &s;oon offered, upon his being appointed general again&s;t the Vol&s;cians. The&s;e, as u&s;ual, had made inroads upon the unguarded frontiers of Rome, and Appius being now the commander of the army, the natural &s;everity of his temper had a field to di&s;play it&s;elf in. The Roman di&s;cipline, which at the milde&s;t was extremely rigorous, he by his &s;trictne&s;s rendered almo&s;t in&s;upportable. The &s;oldiers but &s;lowly obeyed a general they hated, and he, in return, en|crea&s;ed his rigours upon the &s;lowne&s;s of their obedience. They now therefore con&s;idered his &s;everity rather as a malicious vengeance, than an whole&s;ome cha&s;ti&s;ement, and only awaited the enemy, to retaliate, not upon his per&s;on, but his glory. Accordingly the enemy appeared, and the Romans fled. He led them into the camp in order to harrangue them, and they univer&s;ally refu&s;ed to give him an audience. He then en|deavoured to draw them off from the enemy, but the whole body fled, in&s;tead of making a regular retreat. At length he found means of &s;ecuring that part of his forces which yet re|mained,
<PB N="120" REF="131">
by encamping them in a place of &s;afety, where mar&s;haling them in their ranks, and re|viling them for their cowardice, he gave po&s;te|rity a great example of the &s;everity of Roman di&s;cipline, and the greatne&s;s of military obe|dience. He fir&s;t ordered all the centurions who had fled or quitted their ranks, to be &s;courged and then beheaded; and then a&s;king his &s;oldiers where were their arms, he cho&s;e out every tenth man, by lot, and him he executed in the pre|&s;ence of his trembling companions. Soldiers, with &s;o much ardour for liberty in times of peace, and &s;uch profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their generals in war, were fitted to make the conque&s;t of the world. Appius however, did not long continue unmole&s;ted in his &s;everity, for &s;ome time after, the tribunes pu&s;hed on the Agrarian law with vigour, and he per&s;i&s;ting in his oppo&s;ition, they appointed him a day to an|&s;wer to an accu&s;ation again&s;t him, of being the declared enemy of public liberty. Appius obeyed, but appeared before the people, not in the u&s;ual manner, in a &s;upplicating dre&s;s or po&s;ture, but &s;poke for him&s;elf with a confi|dence, that a previous, &s;ettled re&s;olution to die, had in&s;pired. The tribunes finding that his in|nocence was too apparent to be impeached, put off his trial to another day, which he prevented by &s;uicide, a practice that was now becoming common in Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="132">
The death of Appius, and &s;ome wars, or ra|ther incur&s;ions made by the Romans into the territories of the Vol&s;ci, &s;u&s;pended for a time, the peoples earne&s;tne&s;s after the Agrarian law, <MILESTONE N="292" UNIT="U.

The oppo&s;ition to this was not le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> violent on the &s;ide of the patricians, who drove the clamorous multitude from the Forum, headed by Cae&s;o, the &s;on of that Quintius Cin|cinnatus, whom we &s;hall hereafter find &s;o fa|mous for his courage and his frugality. The tribunes re&s;olved to make an example of this young patrician, to deter the future outrages of others, and therefore appointed him a day to an&s;wer for his life, before the people. His being the &s;on of a man entirely re&s;pected by both parties, was treated with &s;uch lenity, that he was admitted to bail, but flying to Etruria, his father was obliged to &s;ell almo&s;t his whole e&s;tate to reimbur&s;e the &s;ureties, and then retreating to a &s;mall farm and a little cot|tage beyond the Tyber, lived a contented life, tilling his few acres, with his own hands, and reaping the produce of his indu&s;try. The tri|bunes however, were not &s;atisfied with the ex|pul&s;ion
<PB N="122" REF="133">
of Cae&s;o, they &s;till continued to clamour for the Agrarian law, and even rai&s;ed a report, that the &s;enators had formed a plot again&s;t their lives. This contrivance was principally intended to fright the &s;enate into a compliance; but it had only the more obvious effect of encrea&s;ing the tumults of the people, and aggravating their animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of commotion and univer&s;al di&s;|order, Rome was upon the point of falling into the power of a foreign enemy. Herdonius, a Sabine, a man of great intrepidity and ambi|tion, formed the de&s;ign of &s;eizing and plunder|ing the city, while it was employed in inte&s;|tine di&s;tractions. For this purpo&s;e, having got together an army of about four thou&s;and men, compo&s;ed of his clients and fugitive &s;laves, he &s;ent them down the river Tyber on floats by night, &s;o that the people were a&s;toni&s;hed the next morning, to behold a foreign enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Capitol, the citadel of Rome. Herdonius, on his part, did all that was in his power to per&s;uade the lower citizens and &s;laves to join his party; to the one he promi&s;ed free|dom, to the other an ample participation of benefits and &s;poil The tribunes, in this exi|gence, were far from exciting the people to arms, they, on the contrary, u&s;ed all their elo|quence to per&s;uade them from fighting, until the patricians &s;hould engage by oath, to create
<PB N="123" REF="134">
ten men, with a power of making laws, and to &s;uffer the people to have an equal &s;hare in all the benefits that &s;hould accrue. The&s;e condi|tions, though very &s;evere, the nece&s;&s;ity of the times obliged the con&s;uls to promi&s;e, and Va|lerius, who was one of them, putting him&s;elf at the head of &s;uch as offered, marched to|wards the capitol, crying out as he pa&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever wi&s;hes to &s;ave his country, let him come and follow me."</Q> A large body of people followed him to the attack, and the ca|pitol was at length retaken by &s;torm, but the con&s;ul was killed in the a&s;&s;ault. Herdonius &s;lew him&s;elf, the &s;laves died by the executioner, and the re&s;t were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>But although the city was thus delivered from a foreign inva&s;ion, it was by no means &s;et free from its inte&s;tine divi&s;ions. The tri|bunes now pre&s;&s;ed the &s;urviving con&s;ul for the performance of his promi&s;e; but it &s;eems, the Agrarian law was a grant the &s;enate could not think of giving up to the people. The con&s;ul therefore, made many delays and excu&s;es, till at length, being driven to give a po&s;itive an|&s;wer, he told them, that as the promi&s;e was made by the two con&s;uls, he could do nothing alone. An a&s;&s;embly was therefore now ap|pointed for chu&s;ing another con&s;ul, and the &s;e|nate, in order to give the people no hopes of obtaining their wi&s;hes, fixed upon Quintus Cin|cinnatus,

who&s;e &s;on had &s;o lately been obnoxi|ous to them. Cincinnatus had, as has been al|ready related, for &s;ome time given up all the views of ambition, and retired to his little farm, where the deputies of the &s;enate found him holding the plow, and dre&s;&s;ed in the mean at|tire of a labouring hu&s;band-man. He apeared but little elevated with the addre&s;&s;es of cere|mony, and the pompous habits they brought him, and upon declaring to him the &s;enate's plea&s;ure, he te&s;tified rather a concern that his aid &s;hould be wanted: he naturally preferred the charms of a country retirement, to the fa|tiguing &s;plendours of office, and only &s;aid to his wife, as they were leading him away, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fear, my Attillia, that for this year, our little fields mu&s;t remain un&s;own."</Q> Thus taking a tender leave, he departed for the city, where both parties were &s;trongly enflamed again&s;t each other. This new con&s;ul however, was re&s;olved to &s;ide with neither, but by a &s;trict attention to the intere&s;ts of his country, in&s;tead of gaining the confidence of faction, to &s;eize the e&s;teem of all. Thus, by threats, and well-timed &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, he prevailed upon the tribunes to put off their law for a time, and carried him&s;elf &s;o as to be a terror to the multitude, whenever they refu&s;ed to enli&s;t, and their greate&s;t encourager whenever their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion de&s;erved it. His po|licy con&s;i&s;ted in holding the citizens who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">egained the Capitol, as &s;till engaged to follow

Thus having re&s;tored that tranquility to the people, which he &s;o much loved him&s;elf, he again gave up the &s;plendours of ambition, to enjoy it with a greater reli&s;h in his little farm.</P>
<P>Cincinnatus was not long retired from his office, when a fre&s;h exigence of the &s;tate once more required his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Aequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the Vol&s;ci, who, though &s;till wor&s;ted, &s;till were for renewing the war, made new inroads into the territories of Rome.

This however, the Aequi had the precaution to fortify, &s;o that the Roman army was &s;o hem|med in on every &s;ide, that nothing remained but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the enemy, famine, or imme|diate

death. Some knights who found means of getting away privately through the enemy's camp, were the fir&s;t that brought the account of this di&s;a&s;ter to Rome. Nothing could ex|ceed the con&s;ternation of all ranks of people, when informed of it; the &s;enate, at fir&s;t, thought of the other con&s;ul, but not having &s;uf|ficient experience of his abilities, they unani|mou&s;ly turned their eyes upon Cincinnatus, and re&s;olved to make him dictator. Cincinnatus, the only per&s;on on whom Rome could now place her whole dependence, was found, as be|fore, by the me&s;&s;engers of the &s;enate, labouring in his little field, with chearful indu&s;try. He was at fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed by the en&s;igns of unbounded power, with which the deputies came to inve&s;t him, but &s;till more at the ap|proach of the principal of the &s;enate, who came out to meet him upon his approach. A dignity &s;o unlooked for however, had no effect upon the &s;implicity or the integrity of his manners: and being now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab&s;olute power, and called upon to nominate his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, he cho&s;e a poor man named Tarquitius, one who, like him&s;elf, de&s;pi&s;ed riches when they led to di&s;|honour. Tarquitius was born of a patrician family, but though of con&s;ummate bravery, never being able to rai&s;e money to purcha&s;e an hor&s;e, he had hitherto fought only as a foot &s;oldier, willing to &s;erve his country, though in the humble&s;t &s;ituation. Thus the &s;aving a great
<PB N="127" REF="138">
nation was devolved upon an hu&s;bandman, taken from the plough, and an ob&s;cure centinel found among the dregs of the army. Upon entering the city, the dictator put on a &s;erene look, and entreated all tho&s;e who were able to bear arms, to repair before &s;un-&s;et to the Cam|pus Martius (the place were the levies were made) with nece&s;&s;ary arms, and provi&s;ions for five days. He put him&s;elf at the head of the&s;e, and marching all night with great expe|dition, he arrived before day, within &s;ight of the enemy. Upon his approach, he ordered his &s;oldiers to rai&s;e a loud &s;hout, to apprize the con&s;ul's army of the relief that was at hand. The Aequi were not a little amazed, when they &s;aw them&s;elves between two enemies, but &s;till more, when they perceived Cincinnatus making the &s;tronge&s;t entrenchments beyond them, to prevent their e&s;cape, and enclo&s;ing them as they had enclo&s;ed the con&s;ul. To prevent this, a furious combat en&s;ued, but the Aequi being attacked on both &s;ides and unable to re&s;i&s;t or fly, begged a ce&s;&s;ation of arms. They offered the dictator his own terms; he gave them their lives, but obliged them, in token of &s;ervitude, to pa&s;s under the yoke, which was two &s;pears &s;et upright, and another acro&s;s, in the form of a door, beneath which the vanqui&s;hed were to march. Their captains and generals he made pri&s;oners of war, being re&s;erved to adorn his triumph. As for the plunder of the enemies

Thus, having re&s;cued a Roman army from inevitable de&s;truction, having defeated a powerful enemy, having taken and fortified their city, and &s;till more, having refu&s;ed any part of the &s;poil, he re&s;igned his dictator&s;hip&punc; after having enjoyed it but fourteen days. The &s;enate would have enriched him, but he declined their proffers, chu&s;ing to retire once more to his farm and his cottage, content with temperance and fame.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="296" UNIT="U. C."> The year following, the Aequi re&s;olving to retrieve their lo&s;t reputation, again marched into the field, and retook their city, wherefore, when levies were to be made in Rome to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, the tribunes refu&s;ed to let the people be enrolled. The nece&s;&s;ity of the times however was &s;uch, that an army was to be rai&s;ed, and the &s;enators finding the reluctance of the multitude, offered to go them&s;elves, with their clients and dependants. So many old and reverend men, who had long been con&s;i|dered as the fathers of the &s;tate, marching feebly out to meet an enemy, whom the young and the vigorous refu&s;ed to encounter, moved the multitude to &s;uch a degree, that in &s;pite of their demagogues, they offered to go, only demand|ing as a recompence, to have the number of
<PB N="129" REF="140">
their tribunes encrea&s;ed from five to ten. This &s;ome of the &s;enate con&s;idered as an expedient to multiply the number of their enemies; but Cin|cinnatus, who judged more maturely upon the &s;ubject, a&s;&s;ured them, it would be the mo&s;t in|fallible means of debilitating that power which had &s;o long controlled them. That in ca&s;e ten were elected, in &s;uch a number there were the mo&s;t ju&s;t expectations to bring over a part, and that a &s;ingle tribune could rever&s;e the re&s;olu|tions of all the re&s;t: accordingly, the &s;enate rea|dily came into his opinion, and pretending to make their compliance a favour, informed the tribunes, that they had, after much delibera|tion, thought proper to grant their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>This grant &s;eemed for a while to &s;atisfy the people, but in le&s;s than a year, the new tribunes, the fir&s;t time, uniting all together, made &s;till farther encroachments, and ventured, even by their own authority, to order an a&s;&s;embling of the &s;enate. They required al&s;o, that mount Aventine, which being a mile and a half in compa&s;s, and as yet untenanted, might be granted to the people to build on. With this, though not till after the mo&s;t violent conte&s;ts, the &s;enate agreed, in hopes that it might be a means of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;editions, which they dreaded from refu&s;ing the Agrarian law. Never|thele&s;s, in this they were di&s;appointed, for &s;oon <MILESTONE N="298" UNIT="U. C."> after, their tribunes renewed their former com|plaints
<PB N="130" REF="141">
and in&s;olence, and the conte&s;ts were car|ried on with &s;uch little re&s;traint, that blows and not arguments generally terminated every deli|beration. To &s;uch a pitch of audaciou&s;ne&s;s were they arrived, that tho&s;e demagogues &s;et a day, even for the con&s;uls them&s;elves, to an&s;wer before the people. They thought proper how|ever, upon maturer con&s;ideration, to let drop this in&s;olent pro&s;ecution, but at the &s;ame time, re&s;olved not to di&s;continue their unremitting endeavours for the Agrarian law. A day ac|cordingly was fixed, in which this important &s;ubject was to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and numbers of all ranks were pre&s;ent, either to give their votes or their opinions. The tribunes &s;poke largely on the ju&s;tice of &s;uch a law; &s;everal of the people related what &s;ervices they had done, and what trifling rewards they had obtained: the audi|ence were prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the law, but &s;till more, when Siccius Dentatus, a plebeian, advanced in years, but of an admirable per&s;on and military deportment, came forward to enu|merate his hard&s;hips and his merits. This old &s;oldier made no &s;cruple of extolling the various atchievements of his youth, but indeed his me|rits de&s;erved his o&s;tentation. He had &s;erved his country in the wars forty years: he had been an officer thirty, fir&s;t a centurion, then a tribune: he had fought one hundred and twenty battles, in which, by the force of his &s;ingle arm,
<PB N="131" REF="142">
he had &s;aved a multitude of lives: he had gained fourteen civic, three mural, and eight golden crowns, be&s;ides eighty-three chains, &s;ixty bracelets, eighteen gilt &s;pears, and twenty-three hor&s;e-trappings, whereof nine were for killing his enemy in &s;ingle combat: moreover, he had received forty-five wounds, all before, and none behind, particularly, twelve on the day the Ca|pitol was recovered from the enemy. The&s;e were his honours, yet notwith&s;tanding all this, he had never received any &s;hare of tho&s;e lands which were won from the enemy, but continued to draw on a life of poverty and contempt, while others were po&s;&s;e&s;t of tho&s;e very territories which his valour had won, without any merit to de|&s;erve them, or ever having contributed to the conque&s;t. A ca&s;e of &s;o much hard&s;hip had a &s;trong effect upon the multitude; they unani|mou&s;ly demanded, that the law might be pa&s;&s;ed, and that &s;uch merit &s;hould not go unrewarded. It was in vain that &s;ome of the &s;enators ro&s;e up to &s;peak again&s;t it, their voices were drowned by the cries of the people. When rea&s;on therefore could no longer be heard, pa&s;&s;ion, as u&s;ual &s;uc|ceeded, and the young patricians running furi|ou&s;ly into the throng, broke the balloting urns, and di&s;per&s;ed the multitude that offered to op|po&s;e them. For this they were &s;ome time after fined by the tribunes, but their re&s;olution ne|verthele&s;s,

for the pre&s;ent put off the Agrarian law.</P>
<P>It generally happened in Rome, that internal commotions were quieted by foreign inva&s;ions, and the approach of the Aequi within &s;ixteen miles of the city, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored peace to the republick. In this war Siccius Dentatus, the veteran who had harangued the people, gained greater honours than the con&s;ul who obtained the victory: for being ordered upon a forlorn hope, to attack the enemy in a quarter where he knew they were inacce&s;&s;ible; he, at fir&s;t remon&s;trated the danger and de&s;pe|ration of the attempt, but being reproached by the con&s;ul with cowardice, he led on his body of eight hundred veterans to the place, re&s;olved to give by his death, a pattern of obedience, as he had in his life, an example of re&s;olution. Fortune however, was kinder to him than his expectations, for perceiving a pa&s;&s;age into the enemies camp, which had not been pointed out by the con&s;ul; he led his veterans onward, and while the whole army amu&s;ed the enemies on one &s;ide, he attacked their camp on the other, &s;o that the Romans obtained a complete victory. Dentatus however, being con&s;cious that he was &s;ent upon this dangerous &s;ervice, only to pro|cure him death or infamy, had intere&s;t enough, upon his return, to prevent the con&s;ul's having a triumph, as al&s;o to get him&s;elf created a tri|bune;

likewi&s;e, to get a law pa&s;&s;ed for puni&s;hing &s;uch magi&s;trates as &s;hould for the future violate their authority, and for having both con&s;uls fined for their behaviour to him in particular. Thus the fortune, as well as the per&s;everance of the tribunes, &s;erved to dimini&s;h the patrician power every year. All their honours were now fading fa&s;t away; their very po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e fruits of long labour, remained feebly in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, and the next popular breeze threatened to &s;hake them down.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. From the creation of the Decemviri to the extinction of that office.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commonwealth of Rome had now <MILESTONE N="302" UNIT="U. C."> for near &s;ixty years been fluctuating between the contending orders that compo&s;ed it, till at length, each &s;ide, as if weary, were willing to re&s;pire a while from the mutual exertions of their claims. The Agrarian law &s;eemed now but little attended to, and all the animo&s;ity which it had produced, appeared &s;ub&s;ided. But it has ever been with mankind, that they form new de&s;ires, in proportion to the number of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The citizens, now therefore, of every rank, began to complain of the arbitrary deci|&s;ions
<PB N="134" REF="145">
of their magi&s;trates, and wi&s;hed to be guided by a written body of laws, which when known, might prevent wrongs as well as puni&s;h them. In this, both the &s;enate and the people concurred, as hoping that &s;uch laws would put an end to the commotions that &s;o long had harra&s;&s;ed the &s;tate. It was thereupon agreed, that amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould be &s;ent to the Greek cities in Italy, and to Athens, to bring home &s;uch laws from thence, as by experience had been found mo&s;t equitable and u&s;eful. For this purpo&s;e, three &s;enators, Po&s;thumius, Sulpicius, and Manlius, were fixed upon, and gallies a&s;|&s;igned to convoy them, agreeable to the maje&s;ty of the Roman people. While they were upon this commi&s;&s;ion abroad, a dreadful plague de|populated the city at home, and &s;upplied the interval of their ab&s;ence with other anxiety than that of wi&s;hes for their return. In about a year however, the plague cea&s;ed, and the amba&s;&s;a|dors returned, bringing home a body of laws, collected from the mo&s;t civilized &s;tates of Greece and Italy, which being afterwards formed into ten tables, and two more being added, made that celebrated code, called the laws of the twelve tables, many fragments of which remain to this day.</P>
<P>The amba&s;&s;adors were no &s;ooner returned, than the tribunes required, that a body of men &s;hould be cho&s;en to dige&s;t their new laws into
<PB N="135" REF="146">
proper form, and to give weight to the execu|tion of them. After long debates whether this choice &s;hould not be partly made from the people as well as the patricians, it was at la&s;t agreed that ten of the principal &s;enators, &s;hould be elected, who&s;e power continuing for a year, &s;hould be equal to that of kings and con&s;uls, and that without any appeal. That all other magi&s;trates &s;hould lay down their offices, until the laws &s;hould direct proper &s;ub&s;titutes, and that the new legi&s;lators &s;hould, in the mean time, exerci&s;e their authority with all the en&s;igns of their di&s;|continued power. The per&s;ons cho&s;en were, Appius and Genutius, who had been elected con&s;uls for the en&s;uing year, Po&s;thumius, Sul|picius, and Manlius, the three amba&s;&s;adors, Sex|tius and Romulus, former con&s;uls, with Julius, Veturius, and Horatius, &s;enators of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration. Thus the whole con&s;titution of the &s;tate at once took a new form, and a dread|ful experiment was going to be tried, of go|verning one nation, by laws formed from the manners and cu&s;toms of another.</P>
<P>The Decemviri being now inve&s;ted with ab|&s;olute power, agreed to take the reigns of go|vernment by turns, and that each &s;hould di&s;|pen&s;e ju&s;tice for a day. They agreed al&s;o, to avoid envy, that he alone, who was in the ac|tual exerci&s;e of power, &s;hould be attended with the en&s;igns of it; and that the re&s;t &s;hould be
<PB N="136" REF="147">
only preceded by a petty officer, called Ac|cen&s;us, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the vulgar.</P>
<P>The novelty of this form of government &s;eemed extremely plea&s;ing to the people at fir&s;t, nor was the moderation of the decemviri them&s;elves, le&s;s prai&s;e-worthy. Appius, in par|ticular, bore away the greate&s;t &s;hare of popu|larity, his affable air, his republican profe&s;&s;ions, and his moderation, made them even forget his ance&s;tors, or that they once trembled at the name. The&s;e magi&s;trates for the fir&s;t year, wrought with extreme application: they had not only to compile from a great variety of Greek laws, but they were obliged al&s;o to get them interpreted by one Hermodorus, an Ephe&s;ian, as they them&s;elves were ignorant of the lan|guage; a &s;trong in&s;tance how little as yet the Romans were advanced in the arts of polite|ne&s;s. At length however, by the help of their interpreter, they formed a body of laws from tho&s;e brought from Greece, and from the or|dinances of their own kings, the whole com|prized in ten tables. The&s;e were agreed to by the whole people, engraven on plates of bra&s;s, and hung up in public view, in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the Forum.</P>
<P>Their work being thus fini&s;hed, it was ex|pected, that the Decemviri would be contented to retire, but having known the charms of pow|er, they were now unwilling to re&s;ign it: they
<PB N="137" REF="148">
therefore pretended, that &s;ome laws were yet wanting to compleat their de&s;ign, and entreat|ed the &s;enate for a continuance of their office. To this they a&s;&s;ented. The choice of per|&s;ons was next the object of public con&s;idera|tion. Appius, burning with a &s;ecret thir&s;t of power, feigned him&s;elf quite di&s;gu&s;ted with the fatigues of the office, and wi&s;hed only for an able &s;ucce&s;&s;or. However, underhand he contrived to put all tho&s;e popular arts in prac|tice, which he knew would, upon his &s;tanding a candidate, &s;ecure his election. Accordingly, when the day came, his colleagues were &s;ur|prized to &s;ee him the fir&s;t upon the li&s;t of the&s;e who &s;tood for the office; and &s;till more, when they found him elected by a great ma|jority of the giddy people, who mi&s;took his ambition for popularity. His friends al&s;o were elected through his influence. Fabius, Cornelius, Servilius, Minucius, Antonius, and Rabulius, who were patricians, together with Petillius, Oppius, and Duellius, plebeians, formed the &s;econd decemvirate. The&s;e three la&s;t were cho&s;en from among the people by the in|tere&s;t of Appius, who, to ingratiate him&s;elf with the multitude, ob&s;erved, that it was very proper the people &s;hould have a &s;hare in form|ing tho&s;e laws, by which the people were to to be governed.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="149">
Appius being thus rein&s;tated in his high of|fice, now turned all his thoughts towards making it formidable and perpetual: he therefore con|vened his colleagues, and knowing them to be all his creatures, he opened to them his de&s;ign of retaining the power, of which they had been put into po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ion. As they had been previou&s;ly in&s;tructed, they readily came into his propo&s;al, and bound them&s;elves by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows, never to di&s;&s;ent among them&s;elves; never to give up their authority; and not to make u&s;e of the opinions either of the &s;enate or the people, but in ca&s;es of downright nece&s;&s;ity. Now there|fore, the decemvirate put on a very different appearance from the former year: in&s;tead only of one of them being attended by his rods and axes, each made his appearance with tho&s;e en|&s;igns of terror and authority. In&s;tead of magi&s;|trates, mild, ju&s;t, and affable, the people now beheld them converted into mon&s;ters of rapine, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty. They only made u&s;e of the forms of ju&s;tice, to put many of the citizens to death, and deprive others of their e&s;tates and country. Accu&s;ers and informers were &s;uborned from among their dependants, ready to give evidence as they were command|ed; while tho&s;e who expected redre&s;s in any &s;uit of ju&s;tice, had no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, but to en|ter into a criminal confederacy with their judges. Thus an univer&s;al corruption began to &s;pread
<PB N="139" REF="150">
it&s;elf over the people, while the good and the wi&s;e either bani&s;hed them&s;elves from Rome, or inwardly repined at its di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But as &s;uch power could not long continue without &s;ome of the u&s;ual arts of deception, which tyranny mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;toops to, in or|der to &s;hew the people, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ere not un|mindful of their duty, they added two tables more of laws to tho&s;e already promulgated, which together formed, as we have already &s;aid, that body of laws that goes by the name of the twelve tables. In the&s;e la&s;t there was a law, prohibiting all marriages between the patri|cians and plebeians, by which they hoped to widen the breach between the&s;e two orders, and thus avail them&s;elves of their mutual animo&s;ity. Their de&s;igns however were ea&s;ily &s;een through, but the people bore them with patience, for the time of the expiration of their office was now at hand, in which it was expected, they would lay down their mi&s;u&s;ed authority. But they &s;oon threw off the ma&s;k, and regardle&s;s either of the approbation of the &s;enate or the people, continued them&s;elves, again&s;t all order, another year in the decemvirate. A conduct &s;o noto|rious produced new di&s;contents, and the&s;e were as &s;ure to produce fre&s;h acts of tyranny. The city was become almo&s;t a de&s;ert, with re&s;pect to all who had any thing to lo&s;e, and the decem|virs rapacity was then only di&s;continued, when
<PB N="140" REF="151">
they wanted fre&s;h objects to exerci&s;e it upon. In this &s;tate of &s;lavery, pro&s;cription and mutual di&s;tru&s;t, not one citizen was found to &s;trike for his country's freedom; the&s;e tyrants continued to rule without control, being con&s;tantly guard|ed, not with their lictors alone, but a numerous crowd of dependants, clients, and even patri|cians, whom their vices had confederated round them.</P>
<P>In this gloomy &s;ituation of the &s;tate, the Aequi and Vol&s;ci, tho&s;e con&s;tant enemies of the Romans, undertook their incur&s;ions, re&s;olved to profit by the inte&s;tine divi&s;ions of the people, and advanced within about ten miles of Rome. This was an unexpected &s;troke to the decem|viri, who had no authority to rai&s;e an army them&s;elves, and therefore went reluctantly to a&s;k aid from the &s;enate, who&s;e deliberations had now been long &s;u&s;pended. In this pre&s;&s;ing junc|ture, the &s;enate was at la&s;t called together, where Appius, in a premeditated oration, pro|pounded the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they were con|vened. He then de&s;ired that each &s;hould &s;peak his &s;entiments as he named them, but Valerius, the grand&s;on of Poplicola, ri&s;ing out of his turn, was ordered by the tyrant to &s;it down. Valerius however, would not de&s;i&s;t, but violent|ly inveighed again&s;t the tyranny of the decem|virate, and their effrontery, in expecting that the &s;enate, who&s;e power they had de&s;troyed,
<PB N="141" REF="152">
&s;hould now take mea&s;ures to &s;upport their be|trayers. His &s;peech was &s;econded by Marcus Horatius, who, with &s;till greater freedom, ex|po&s;ed their horrid inva&s;ion of the rights of their country; their outrages, their rapines, and their cruelty. Appius, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed to bear this harrangue with patience, but at la&s;t, his pa&s;&s;ions, long u&s;ed to indulgence, could no longer keep within re&s;traint, he flew out into violence, and threatened to have Horatius thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock. All the &s;enators exclaimed again&s;t this infringement of the liberty of free debate, as the highe&s;t breach of their privileges, and an intolerable act of power. Whereat the decemvir, a little repenting his ra&s;hne&s;s, began to excu&s;e him&s;elf, &s;aying, that he was willing to give liberty to all deliberations upon the que&s;tion, but could not bear an oration, which, leaving the point in debate, only &s;eemed calculated to promote &s;edi|tion. That he and his colleagues had received an unlimited power from the people, till the great work of forming the laws was fini&s;hed, during which they were re&s;olved to act to the extent of their power, and then would be an|&s;werable for their admini&s;tration. This was a &s;ufficient di&s;play of their intentions, all the un|influenced part of the &s;enate, particularly Clau|dius, the uncle of Appius, &s;poke with dete&s;ta|tion of their proceedings; but a large party in
<PB N="142" REF="153">
the hou&s;e, whom the decemviri had previov&s;ly formed, and &s;till others whom their fears had bia&s;&s;ed, &s;hewed them&s;elves enclined to agree with Appius in whatever he &s;hould pro|po&s;e. He therefore demanded, that he and his colleagues &s;hould have a power of levying and commanding the forces that were to go again&s;t the Aequi, and immediately a decree of the &s;e|nate pa&s;&s;ed, confirming this propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The decemviri now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the military as well as of the civil power, divided their army into three parts, whereof one conti|nued with Appius in the city, to keep it under awe; the other two were commanded by his colleagues, and were led, one again&s;t the Aequi, and the other again&s;t the Sabines. The Roman &s;oldiers had not got into a method of puni&s;hing the generals whom they di&s;liked, by &s;uffering them&s;elves to be vanqui&s;hed in the field. They put it in practice upon this oca&s;ion, and &s;hame|fully abandoned their camp upon the approach of the enemy. Never was the news of a vic|tory more joyfully received at Rome, than the tidings of this defeat; the generals, as is al|ways the ca&s;e, were blamed for the treachery of their men; &s;ome demanded that they &s;hould be depo&s;ed, others cried out for a dictator to lead the troops to conque&s;t; but among the re&s;t, old Sic|cius Dentatus, the tribune, &s;poke his &s;entiments with his u&s;ual openne&s;s, and treating the gene|rals
<PB N="143" REF="154">
with contempt, &s;hewed all the faults of their di&s;cipline in the camp, and their conduct in the field. Appius, in the mean time, was not re|mi&s;s in ob&s;erving the di&s;po&s;ition of the people. Dentatus in particular was marked out for ven|geance, and under pretence of doing him par|ticular honour, he was appointed legate, and put at the head of the &s;upplies which were &s;ent from Rome. The office of legate was held as &s;acred among the Romans, as in it were united both the authority of a general, with the reve|rence of the prie&s;thood. Dentatus no way &s;u&s;|pecting his de&s;ign, went to the camp with ala|crity, where he was received with all the external marks of re&s;pect. But the generals &s;oon found means of indulging their de&s;ire of revenge. He was appointed at the head of an hundred men to go and examine a more commodious place for encampment, as he had very candidly a&s;|&s;ured the commanders, that their pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion was wrong. The &s;oldiers however, who were given as his attendants, were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, wretches who had long been mini&s;ters to the vengeance of the decemviri, and who now en|gaged to murder him, tho' with all that terror, which his reputation, as he was called the Ro|man Achilles, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to in&s;pire. With the&s;e de&s;igns they led him from the way into the hollow bo&s;om of a retired mountain, where they began to &s;et upon him from behind.
<PB N="144" REF="155">
Dentatus now too late perceived the treachery of the decemviri, and was re&s;olved to &s;ell his his life as dearly as he could; he therefore put his back to a rock, and defended him&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t clo&s;ely. Tho' now grown old,, he had &s;till the remains of his former valour, and killed no le&s;s than fif|teen of the a&s;&s;ailants, and wounded thirty with his own hand. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins now therefore terrified at his amazing bravery, &s;howered in their javelins upon him at a di&s;tance, all which he received in his &s;hield with undaunted re&s;olution. The combat, though &s;o unequal in numbers, was managed for &s;ome time with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, till at length his a&s;&s;ailants bethought them&s;elves of a&s;cending the rock again&s;t which he &s;tood, and thus poured down &s;tones upon him from above. This &s;ucceeded, the old &s;oldier fell beneath their united efforts, after having &s;hewn by his death, that it was to his fortitude, and not his fortune, he had come off &s;o many times victorious. The decemviri pretended to join in the general &s;orrow for &s;o brave a man, and decreed him a funeral with the fir&s;t military honours: but the greatne&s;s of their apparent di&s;tre&s;s, compared with their known hatred, only rendered them &s;till more dete&s;table to the people. However, a tran&s;action &s;till more atrocious than the former, &s;erved to in&s;pire the citizens with re&s;olution to break all
<PB N="145" REF="156">
mea&s;ures of obedience, and at la&s;t to re&s;tore freedom.</P>
<P>Appius, who &s;till remained at Rome, &s;it|ting one day on his tribunal to di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;|tice, &s;aw a maiden of exqui&s;ite beauty, and aged about fifteen, pa&s;&s;ing to one of the pub|lic &s;chools, attended by a matron, her nur&s;e. The charms of this dam&s;el, heightened by all the innocence of virgin mode&s;ty, caught his at|tention, and fired his heart. The day following, as &s;he pa&s;t, he found her &s;till more beautiful than before, and his brea&s;t &s;till more enflamed. He now therefore re&s;olved to obtain the grati|fication of his pa&s;&s;ion, whatever &s;hould be the con&s;equence, and found means to inform him|&s;elf of the virgin's name and family. Her name was Virginia. She was the daughter of Virginius, a centurion, then with the army in the field, and had been contracted to Icilius, formerly a tribune of the people, who had agreed to marry her at the end of the pre&s;ent campaign. Appius at fir&s;t re&s;olved to break this match, and to e&s;pou&s;e her him&s;elf; but the laws of the twelve tables had forbidden the pa|tricians to intermarry with the plebeians, and he could not infringe the&s;e, as he was the enactor of them. Nothing therefore remained but a criminal enjoyment, which, as he was long u&s;ed to the indulgence of all his pa&s;&s;ions, he re&s;olved on. After having vainly tried to corrupt the
<PB N="146" REF="157">
fidelity of her nur&s;e, he had recour&s;e to another expedient, &s;till more guilty. He pitched upon one Claudius, who had long been the mini&s;ter of his plea&s;ures, to a&s;&s;ert that the beautiful maid was his &s;lave, and to refer the cau&s;e to his tribunal for deci&s;ion. Claudius behaved exactly according to his in&s;tructions, for entering into the &s;chool, where Virginia was playing among her female companions, he &s;eized upon her as his property, and was going to drag her away by force, but was prevented by the people drawn together by her cries. At length how|ever, after the fir&s;t heat of oppo&s;ition was over, he led the weeping virgin to the tribunal of Appius, and there plau&s;ibly expo&s;ed his pre|ten&s;ions. He a&s;&s;erted that &s;he was born in his hou&s;e, of a female &s;lave, who &s;old her to the wife of Virginius, who had been barren. That he had &s;everal creditable evidences to prove the truth of what he &s;aid, but that until they could come together, it was but rea&s;onable, that the &s;lave &s;hould be delivered into his cu&s;|tody, being her proper ma&s;ter. Appius &s;eemed to be &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of his claims; he ob&s;erved, that if the reputed father him&s;elf were pre&s;ent, he might indeed be willing to delay the delivery of the maiden for &s;ome time, but that it was not lawful for him in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to detain her from her lawful ma&s;ter. He therefore adjudged her to Claudius, as his &s;lave,
<PB N="147" REF="158">
to be kept by him till Virginius &s;hould be able to prove his paternity. This &s;entence was re|ceived with loud clamours and reproaches by the multitude; the women in particular came round the innocent Virginia, as if willing to protect her from her judge's fury, while Icilius, her lover, boldly oppo&s;ed the decree, and obliged Claudius to take refuge under the tri|bunal of the decemvir. All things now threa|tened an open in&s;urrection, when Appius fear|ing the event, thought proper to &s;u&s;pend his judgment till the arrival of Virginius, who was then about eleven miles from Rome, with the army. The day following however, was fixed for the trial, and in the mean time, Appius &s;ent letters to the generals to confine Virgi|nius, as his arrival in town might only &s;erve to kindle &s;edition among the people. The&s;e letters however, were intercepted by the cen|turion's friends, who &s;ent him down a full re|lation of the de&s;ign laid again&s;t the liberty and the honour of his only daughter. Virginius upon this, pretending the death of a near re|lation, got permi&s;&s;ion to leave the camp, and flew to Rome, in&s;pired with indignation and revenge. Accordingly, the next day he ap|peared before the tribunal, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of Appius, leading his weeping daughter by the hand, both habited in the deepe&s;t mourning. Claudius, the accu&s;er, was al&s;o
<PB N="148" REF="159">
there, and began by making his demand: he &s;aid, that it was well known, that the children of &s;laves belonged to the ma&s;ters of their pa|rents, and that Virginia was born in &s;lavery. He ob&s;erved, that pity might be an induce|ment to many to forego their claims, but that he would &s;acrifice all le&s;&s;er con&s;iderations to ju&s;tice. He then produced a female &s;lave whom he had corrupted, to &s;wear that &s;he had &s;old Virginia to the wife of her reputed father, and he ended his preten&s;ions by a&s;&s;erting, that he could confirm her te&s;timony by that of many others, had it been needful. Virginius next &s;poke in turn; he repre&s;ented that his wife had many children, that &s;he had been &s;een pregnant by numbers; that if he had inten|tions of adopting a &s;uppo&s;ititious child, he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a girl; that it was notorious to all, that his wife had her&s;elf &s;uckled her own child; and that it was &s;urprizing, &s;uch a claim &s;hould be now revived, after a fifteen years di&s;continuance. While the father &s;poke this with a &s;tern air, Virginia &s;tood trembling by, and with looks of per&s;ua|&s;ive innocence, added weight to all his remon|&s;trances. The people &s;eemed entirely &s;atisfied of the hard&s;hip of his ca&s;e, till Appius fear|ing what he &s;aid might have dangerous effects upon the multitude, interrupted him, under a pretence of being &s;ufficiently in|&s;tructed
<PB N="149" REF="160">
in the merits of the cau&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, &s;ays he, my con&s;cience obliges me to de|clare, that I my&s;elf am a witne&s;s to the truth of the depo&s;ition of Claudius.

However, it is not now too late, and by the power ve&s;ted in me for the publick good, I adjudge Virginia to be the property of Claudius, the plaintiff. Go, therefore, lictors, di&s;per&s;e the multitude, and make room for a ma&s;ter to repo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of his &s;lave."</Q> The lictors, in obedience to his command, &s;oon drove off the throng that pre&s;&s;ed round the tribunal, and now they &s;eized upon Virginia, and were delivering her up into the hands of Claudius, when Virginius who found that all was over, &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce in the &s;entence. He therefore mildly entreated Ap|pius to be permitted to take a la&s;t farewel of her whom he had long con&s;idered as his child, and that &s;o &s;atisfied, he would return to his duty with fre&s;h alacrity.

while &s;upported her head upon his brea&s;t, and wiped away the tears that rolled down her lovely vi&s;age, and happening to be near the &s;hops that &s;urrounded the Forum, he &s;natched up a knife that lay on the &s;hambles, and addre&s;&s;ing his daughter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My deare&s;t, lo&s;t child, cried he, this, this alone can pre&s;erve your honour and your freedom."</Q> So &s;aying, he buried the weapon in her brea&s;t, and then holding it up, reeking with the blood of his daughter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ap|pius, he cried, by this blood of innocence, I devote thy head to the infernal gods."</Q> Thus &s;aying, with the bloody knife in his hand, and threatening de&s;truction to who&s;oever &s;hould op|po&s;e him; he ran through the city wildly, cal|ling upon the people to &s;trike for freedom, and from thence went to the camp, in order to &s;pread a &s;imilar flame through the army.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner arrived at the camp, followed by a number of his friends, but he informed the army of all that was done, &s;till holding the bloody knife in his hand. He a&s;ked their par|don, and the pardon of the gods, for having committed &s;o ra&s;h an action, but a&s;cribed it all to the dreadful nece&s;&s;ity of the times. He im|plored them, by that blood which was dearer to him than his own, to redeem their &s;inking country, ob&s;erving, that no military oaths could b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd them to their commanders, who were u&s;urpers all of them, and could pretend to no

real authority. The army, already predi&s;po&s;ed, immediately with &s;houts ecchoed their a&s;&s;ent, and decamping, left their generals behind, to take their &s;tation once more upon mount Aven|tine, whither they had retired about forty years before. The other army, which had been to oppo&s;e the Sabines, &s;eemed to feel a &s;imilar re|&s;entment, and came over in large parties to join them.</P>
<P>Appius, in the mean time, did all he could to quell the di&s;turbances in the city, but finding the tumult incapable of being controlled, and perceiving that his mortal enemies, Valerius and Horatius, were the mo&s;t active in oppo&s;ition, he at fir&s;t attempted to find &s;afety by flight; ne|verthele&s;s, being encouraged by Oppius, who was one of his colleagues, he ventured to a&s;&s;em|ble the &s;enate, and urged the puni&s;hment of all de&s;erters. The &s;enate however, was far from giving him the relief he &s;ought for, they fore&s;aw the dangers and mi&s;eries that threatened the &s;tate, in ca&s;e of oppo&s;ing the incen&s;ed army, they therefore di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to them, offering to re&s;tore their former mode of govern|ment, to which the people joyfully a&s;&s;ented, and returned to the city, if not with the en&s;igns, at lea&s;t, with the plea&s;ure of a triumphant army.</P>
<P>Thus ended the decemvirate, after having continued &s;omewhat le&s;s than three years. I have given the picture of this admini&s;tration,

after the Roman hi&s;torians, aggravated with all the invectives with which they u&s;ually load it. However, if there be any part of their hi&s;tory, in which they &s;hew a manife&s;t prejudice, it is here. The charges again&s;t the decemviri, of rapine and murder, are all, except one or two, merely general; and of the&s;e which are &s;peci|cified, the facts do not &s;eem aequipollent to the accu&s;ation.

All that may be ob&s;erved is, that the laws promulgated by this body of men, were reckoned an admirable compilation, and ever after, in Rome, and even in mo&s;t parts of Europe, even to this day, have continued among lawyers to be of the greate&s;t authority.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. From the expul&s;ion of the Decemviri, to the burning of Rome by the Gauls.</HEAD>
<P>THE people now freed from a yoke which <MILESTONE N="304" UNIT="U. C."> they had laid upon them&s;elves, elected Valerius and Horatius, con&s;uls for the en&s;uing part of the year, and Virginius and Icilius, of the num|ber of their tribunes. The puni&s;hment of the decemviri was what fir&s;t engaged the attention of the&s;e popular magi&s;trates, and Appius was appointed a day to an&s;wer the charges brought again&s;t him of tyranny and murder. Oppius, one of his colleagues, next to him in guilt, was al&s;o arraigned, but both too well &s;aw what mercy they had to expect, either from their judges, who were profe&s;&s;ed enemies, or from the peo|ple, who&s;e re&s;entment they had but too fre|quently incurred: they therefore re&s;olved to prevent that fury which they could not with|&s;tand, and both died by their own hands in pri&s;on. The other eight went into voluntary exile, and Claudius, the pretended ma&s;ter of Virginia, was driven out after them. Thus the vengeance of the tribunes pur&s;ued the&s;e devoted men, and &s;eemed as yet un&s;atisfied with puni&s;h|ing. They were preparing to out-go tho&s;e
<PB N="154" REF="165">
whom they had depo&s;ed for cruelty, in the very &s;ame walks of rage, and the &s;enate began to tremble at &s;eeing &s;o many of their members devoted to de&s;truction. Duillius however, one of the tribunes, being more moderate than the re&s;t of his colleagues, quieted their fears by openly profe&s;&s;ing, that no more blood &s;hould be &s;hed on this occa&s;ion; that &s;ufficient ven|geance had been taken for the death of Virgi|nia, and that he forbade all future pro&s;ecutions on that account.</P>
<P>This in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfied the &s;enate for the pre&s;ent, but they &s;oon found cau&s;e of fre&s;h re&s;entment. The two new con&s;uls &s;eemed en|tirely to have abandoned the intere&s;ts of the patricians, and equally popular with the tri|bunes them&s;elves, to &s;tudy only the gratification of the people. They procured a law, by which each of the plebeians &s;hould, in his individual capacity, have as much influence in all elections and deliberations what&s;oever, as any one of the patricians, which gave the fini&s;hing blow to all di&s;tinction between them. A law &s;o injurious to the power of the &s;enate, produced, as may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, a de&s;ire to mortify the con|&s;uls, who only aimed at encrea&s;ing their own influence, by the depre&s;&s;ion of that body. An op|portunity for this &s;oon offered, for the con&s;uls having marched again&s;t the Aequi and Sabines, gained a complete victory, and demanded a tri|umph.
<PB N="155" REF="166">
The &s;enate however were re&s;olved not to comply, and declared them unworthy of that ho|nour The con&s;uls appealed to the people, and complaining loudly again&s;t the &s;enate, procured a law for the privilege of a triumph, by the authority of the plebeians alone. Thus did the two orders of the &s;tate continue for &s;ome years mutually oppo&s;ing each other, the patricians defending the &s;mall &s;hadow of di&s;tinction which they had left, and the people daily in&s;i&s;ting upon fre&s;h conce&s;&s;ions, as if their appetites encrea&s;ed, by what was granted to &s;atisfy them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the&s;e inte&s;tine tumults produced weakne&s;s within the &s;tate, and confi|dence in the enemy abroad. The wars with the Aequi and Vol&s;ci &s;till continued, and as each year &s;ome trifling advantages were ob|tained over the Romans, they at la&s;t advanced &s;o far, as to make their incur&s;ions to the very <MILESTONE N="309" UNIT="U. C."> walls of Rome. But not the courage only of the Romans &s;eemed dimini&s;hed by the&s;e conte&s;ts, but their other virtues al&s;o, particularly their ju&s;tice. About this time, the inhabitants of two neighbouring cities, Ardea and Aricia, had a conte&s;t between them&s;elves, about &s;ome lands that had long been claimed by both. At length, being unable to agree, they referred it to the &s;enate and the people of Rome. The &s;enate had yet &s;ome of the principles of primitive ju&s;tice remaining, and refu&s;ed to determine the
<PB N="156" REF="167">
di&s;pute. But the people readily undertook the deci&s;ion, and one Scaptius, an old man, declar|ing, that the&s;e very lands of right belonged to Rome, they immediately voted them&s;elves to be the legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and &s;ent home the former litigants, thoroughly convinced of their own folly, and of the Roman inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The tribunes now grew more and more tur|bulent, and having come into a principal &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of government, nothing would &s;atisfy them, without having a participa|tion of the whole. With the&s;e views they pro|po&s;ed two laws, one to permit plebeians to in|termarry with patricians, and the other to per|mit them to be admitted to the con&s;ul&s;hip al&s;o. The &s;enators received the&s;e propo&s;als with their accu&s;tomed indignation, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to undergo the utmo&s;t extremities, rather than &s;ubmit to enacting them. However, finding their re&s;i&s;tance only encrea&s;e the commotions of the &s;tate, they at la&s;t con&s;ented to pa&s;s the law concerning marriages, hoping that this conce&s;&s;ion would &s;atisfy the people. But they were to be appea&s;ed but for a very &s;hort time, for returning to their old cu&s;tom of refu&s;ing to enli&s;t upon the approach of the enemy, the con|&s;uls were forced to hold a private conference with the chief of the &s;enate, where, after many debates, Claudius propo&s;ed an expedient, as the mo&s;t probable means of &s;atisfying the people
<PB N="157" REF="168">
in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. This was by no means to contaminate the con&s;ul&s;hip, by &s;uffer|ing it to come into the hands of the people, but to create &s;ix or eight governors in the room of con&s;uls, whereof, one half at lea&s;t &s;hould be pa|tricians. This project, which was but a poor &s;ub|terfuge, and was in fact, granting what the peo|ple demanded, plea&s;ed the whole meeting, and that nothing might &s;eem preconcerted among them, they agreed, that at the next public meet|ing of the &s;enate, the con&s;uls &s;hould, contrary to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, begin, by a&s;king the opinion of the younge&s;t &s;enator, whereas, formerly they always began by a&s;king that of the &s;enior. Upon a&s;&s;embling the &s;enate, one of the tribunes ac|cu&s;ed them of holding &s;ecret meetings, and managing dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t the people. The con&s;uls, on the other hand, averred their innocence, and to demon&s;trate their &s;incerity, gave any of the younger members of the hou&s;e leave to propound their opinions. The&s;e re|maining &s;ilent, &s;uch of the older &s;enators as were known to be popular, began by ob&s;erving, that the people ought to be indulged in their reque&s;t, and that none &s;o well de&s;erved power, as tho&s;e who were mo&s;t in&s;trumental in gaining it, and that the city could not be free until all were reduced to perfect equality. Claudius, as was agreed upon, &s;poke next, and though very willing to advance the intentions of tho&s;e who
<PB N="158" REF="169">
&s;poke before him, in order to conceal his de|&s;igns, he broke out into bitter invectives again&s;t the people, a&s;&s;erting, that it was his opinion, that the law &s;hould not pa&s;s. This produced &s;ome di&s;turbance among the plebeians, but at length Genutius, as if to moderate between the &s;enate and the people, propo&s;ed, as had been preconcerted, that &s;ix governors &s;hould be an|nually cho&s;en, with con&s;ular authority, three from the &s;enate, and three from the people; and that when the time of their magi&s;tracy &s;hould be expired, then it would be &s;een, whether they would have the &s;ame office continued, or whe|ther the con&s;ul&s;hip &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon its former footing. This project was eagerly embraced by the people, becau&s;e it promi&s;ed &s;omething new, and leave was given to any of the plebeians to &s;tand for this new office. Yet &s;o fickle were the multitude, that though many of their own rank &s;tood, yet none of them were thought worthy of the honour, and the choice wholly fell upon the patricians, who offered them&s;elves as candidates. Thus a new form of <MILESTONE N="310" UNIT="U. C."> government was now to be tried, the people &s;till mi&s;taking change for improvement. The&s;e new magi&s;trates were called M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">itary Tribunes, they were at fir&s;t but three, afterwards they were encrea&s;ed to four, and at length to &s;ix. They had the power and the en&s;igns of con&s;uls, yet their power being divided among a number,
<PB N="159" REF="170">
each &s;ingly was of le&s;s authority. The fir&s;t that were cho&s;en, only continued in their office about three months, the augurs having found &s;ome|thing ami&s;s in the ceremonies of their election.</P>
<P>The military tribunes being depo&s;ed, the con|&s;uls once more came into office, and in order to lighten the weight of bu&s;ine&s;s which they were obliged to &s;u&s;tain, a new office was elected, namely, that of Cen&s;ors, who were to be cho|&s;en every fifth year. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was to take an e&s;timate of the number and e&s;tates of the people, and to di&s;tribute them into their proper cla&s;&s;es; to in&s;pect into the lives and manners of their fellow citizens; to degrade &s;enators for mi&s;conduct; to di&s;mount knights, and to turn down plebeians from their tribes into an infe|rior, in ca&s;e of mi&s;demeanour. The two fir&s;t cen&s;ors were Papirius and Sempronius, both pa|tricians, and from this order they continued to be elected for near an hundred years.</P>
<P>This new creation &s;erved to re&s;tore peace for &s;ome time among the orders, and a triumph gained over the Vol&s;cians by Geganius the con|&s;ul, added to the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction that reign|ed among the people. As it was &s;aid of the Greeks, that a victory gained at the Olympic games rai&s;ed the conqueror to the highe&s;t pitch of human &s;plendour, &s;o it might be &s;aid of the Romans, that a triumph was the greate&s;t ho|nour they had any idea of. For this their ge|nerals
<PB N="160" REF="171">
fought, not le&s;s than for the benefit of the &s;tate; the people al&s;o, when entertained with &s;uch &s;pectacles, forgot their private di&s;tre&s;&s;es in an empty notion of their country's glory.</P>
<P>This calm however, was but of &s;hort conti|nuance, for &s;ome time after, a famine pre&s;&s;ing hard upon the poor, the u&s;ual complaints <MILESTONE N="313" UNIT="U. C."> again&s;t the rich were renewed, and the&s;e, as before, proving ineffectual, produced new &s;e|ditions. The con&s;uls were accu&s;ed of neglect, in not having laid in proper quantities of corn; they however, di&s;regarded the murmurs of the populace, content with exerting all their care in attempts to &s;upply the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities. But though they did all that could be expected from active magi&s;trates, in providing and di&s;tributing provi&s;ions to the poor; yet Spurius Maelius, a rich knight, who had purcha&s;ed up all the corn of Tu&s;cany, by far out&s;hone them in liberality. This patrician, who had long beheld the &s;trug|gles of the &s;tate, was enflamed with a &s;ecret de|&s;ire of becoming powerful by its contentions: he therefore di&s;tributed corn in great quantities among the poorer &s;ort each day, till at la&s;t, his hou&s;e became the a&s;ylum of all &s;uch as wi&s;hed to exchange a life of labour for one of lazy de|pendance. When he had thus gained a &s;ufficient number of partizans, he procured large quanti|ties of arms to be purcha&s;ed and brought into
<PB N="161" REF="172">
his hou&s;e by night, and formed a plan of con|&s;piracy, by which he was to be made com|mander, while &s;ome of the tribunes, whom he had found means to corrupt, were to act under him, in &s;eizing upon the liberties of his coun|try. Minucius, who was at that time appointed to the care of providing for the people, &s;oon di&s;covered the plot that was thus formed again&s;t their freedom, and informing the &s;enate thereof, they immediately formed a re&s;olution of creat|ing a dictator, who &s;hould have the power of quelling the con&s;piracy, without appealing to the people. Cincinnatus, who was now eighty years old, was cho&s;en once more to re&s;cue his country from impending danger. He began by &s;ummoning Maelius to appear, who being, as he thought, &s;ufficiently &s;upported by the mul|titude, refu&s;ed to obey. He next &s;ent Ahala, the ma&s;ter of his hor&s;e, to force him, who meeting him in the Forum, and pre&s;&s;ing Mae|lius to follow him to the dictator's tribunal, upon his refu&s;al, Ahala killed him upon the &s;pot. The dictator applauded the re&s;olution of his officer, and commanded the con&s;pirator's goods to be &s;old, and his hou&s;e to be demo|li&s;hed, di&s;tributing his &s;tores among the people.</P>
<P>The tribunes of the people were much en|raged at the death of Maelius, and in order, in &s;ome mea&s;ure to puni&s;h the &s;enate at the next election, in&s;tead of con&s;uls, in&s;i&s;ted upon re|&s;toring
<PB N="162" REF="173">
<MILESTONE N="315" UNIT="U. C."> their military tribunes. With this, the &s;enate were obliged to comply, and though the plebeians had a right of being taken into the office, three patricians, as in the former elec|tion, were again cho&s;en. The next year how|ever, the government returned to its ancient channel, and con&s;uls were cho&s;en.</P>
<P>During the&s;e conte&s;ts, the Veians and the Vol&s;cians went on with their cu&s;tomary incur|&s;ions, and the very allies of Rome them&s;elves, began to waver in their allegiance. Fidenae, an ancient colony belonging to the Romans, revolted to Tolumnius, king of the Veians, and &s;till more to enhance their crime, murdered the amba&s;&s;adors that were &s;ent to complain of the infidelity. To puni&s;h this conduct with more &s;ignal vengeance, a dictator was appoint|ed, and the choice fell upon Mamercus Aemi|lius. A victory was obtained over the Veii, the king of their nation was &s;lain, and Aemi|lius marched back to Rome, with all the en|&s;igns of triumph, ennobled by the &s;poils of a king.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem now, as if the &s;enate and con|&s;uls could carry on no bu&s;ine&s;s by their own authority alone, &s;ince we find them, the year following, creating another dictator, to oppo&s;e a threatened confederacy of the Veian nations. Servilius Pri&s;cus was cho&s;en to this high office. The year &s;ucceeding, we read of Aemilius, who
<PB N="163" REF="174">
had been dictator &s;o lately before, being again cho&s;en. He having no employment abroad, was re&s;olved to do &s;omething at home, and accordingly cau&s;ed the cen&s;or&s;hip, which had been before appointed to continue eight years, to be held but for one year and an half, for which the cen&s;ors &s;oon after fined and degraded him, upon laying down his office. This con|duct of theirs, on the other hand, enraged the people, and in&s;tead of con&s;uls, military tri|bunes were the next time cho&s;en. In about four <MILESTONE N="320" UNIT="U. C."> years after, con&s;uls were introduced again, and upon a threatened inva&s;ion of the Aequi, a dic|tator, Po&s;thumius Tubero, was created, who clo&s;ed his dictator&s;hip with a triumph. Four <MILESTONE N="326" UNIT="U. C."> years after this, the fluctuation of councils brought up military tribunes again, and their want of &s;ucce&s;s in war, obliged the people to create Aemilius, for the third time, dictator, who gained another triumph. For two years after this, military tribunes continued; then con&s;uls, and then tribunes again: thus the &s;tate continued to fluctuate between the different or|orders, for more than fifteen years, during which time, there was but little of any thing important tran&s;acted, either abroad or at home: the &s;enate &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all its authority, and the people all their military virtue. The former, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the riches of the &s;tate, &s;eemed willing to grant all their privi|leges,
<PB N="164" REF="175">
in order to &s;ecure their property from the Agrarian law; and the people employed &s;o much time in attending the harangues of their tri|bunes, that they became poor, di&s;contented, and noi&s;y. Whenever the approach of an ene|my was talked of, the danger was &s;o magnified, by either the fears or the real weakne&s;s of the &s;tate, that nothing but that de&s;perate me|thod of chu&s;ing a dictator could be found to oppo&s;e it. So that in a period of twenty years, we find the people above ten times giving up their liberty, their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and their lives, to one of their fellow citizens, and only indebted for their &s;afety to his &s;till remaining virtue. Thus after Aemilius, Servilius Pri&s;cus was again cho|&s;en, whom we have mentioned as thrice dicta|tor <MILESTONE N="335. 345." UNIT="U. C."> before, and after him Cornelius Co&s;&s;us. The&s;e ab&s;olute magi&s;trates, it is true, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored di&s;cipline to the army, and encrea&s;ed the territories of the &s;tate; but it was purcha&s;ing conque&s;t too dear, to give up all that was valuable in life to obtain it. The ill effects indeed of their ab&s;olute authority, were not di&s;covered till many years after; at pre&s;ent, the &s;enate &s;eemed plea&s;ed with electing a ma|gi&s;trate out of their own body, who could inti|midate the people: the multitude, on the other hand, were proud to follow and obey one who generally led them to conque&s;t and plunder, for the dictators u&s;ually divided the &s;poils of
<PB N="165" REF="176">
the conquered towns among them, in order to en|crea&s;e their own popularity. Thus the plunder of Anxur, a city taken from the Vol&s;cians, &s;eemed to diffu&s;e a new &s;pirit among&s;t them, which however continued no longer than until their nece&s;&s;ities called for a new &s;upply.</P>
<P>Things continued in this &s;tate of commotion for a long time, factions becoming every day &s;tronger, and the government weaker; the tri|bunes of the people &s;till augmenting the breach between the orders of the commonwealth, and calling their licentiou&s;ne&s;s liberty. At length however, the &s;enate hit upon an expedient, which &s;erved greatly to encrea&s;e their own power, and at the &s;ame time, highly plea&s;ing the people, though it mu&s;t be owned, it &s;erved to &s;hew how greatly the Romans were fallen from their former virtues. The citizens who went to the field, had hitherto fought their country's battles for nothing; they were hu&s;|bandmen and &s;oldiers; the &s;ame hands that drew the &s;word in one &s;ea&s;on, were &s;een hold|ing the plough in another, and they were ob|liged to furni&s;h not only their own arms, but their own provi&s;ions, during the campaign. In the&s;e difficulties however, they chearfully ac|quie&s;ced, as the hopes of plunder, and the ho|nours of returning in triumph, were con&s;i|dered as an ample compen&s;ation. Neverthele&s;s, it &s;ometimes fell out, that if the campaign was
<PB N="166" REF="177">
of long continuance, their little farms remain|ed untilled, and they them&s;elves were reduced the next &s;ea&s;on to extreme indigence. Hence they were obliged to incur debts, and hence proceeded that various train of extortions, u&s;u|ries, and petty cruelties, which the creditors made u&s;e of to oppre&s;s the people. To remedy the&s;e evils, the &s;enate unanimou&s;ly came to a re&s;olution of paying the &s;oldiery out of the trea|&s;ury, and for this purpo&s;e they laid on a new tax, from which none of the citizens were to be exempted. This regulation in &s;ome mea&s;ure, gave a new turn to the Roman method of mak|ing war; as what might before have been called incur&s;ions, were now become regular, lengthen|ed campaigns. The &s;enate was now no longer to be obliged to the tribunes, in order to rai&s;e an army, as the people would gladly enli&s;t, &s;ince they were &s;ure of their reward. Nothing there|fore could exceed their joy upon this occa&s;ion, they &s;urrounded the &s;enate-hou&s;e with accla|mations, they offered to follow their con&s;cript fathers wherever they &s;hould lead them, and promi&s;ed never to murmur more.</P>

The city of Veii
<PB N="167" REF="178">
had long been a flouri&s;hing, &s;trong, and formi|dable place; it was &s;eated upon a craggy rock, and furni&s;hed with re&s;olute and numerous de|fenders. It had lately changed its form of government, from republican into that of king|ly, and &s;uch a change being di&s;liked by the al|lies of this &s;tate, this contributed, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to their tamely &s;uffering it to be &s;ur|rounded by the Roman army. The Romans indeed, had every rea&s;on to in&s;pire them with re&s;entment. The Veians had long been the ri|vals of Rome; they had ever taken the opportu|nity of its internal di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to ravage its territo|ries, and had even treated its amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent to complain of the&s;e injuries, with outrage. It &s;eemed now therefore determined, that Veii, whatever it &s;hould co&s;t, was to fall, and the Romans accordingly &s;ate regularly down before it, prepared for a long and painful re&s;i&s;tance. The &s;trength of the place may be inferred from the continuance of the &s;iege, which la&s;ted for ten years, during which time, the army conti|nued encamped round it, lying in winter, un|der tents made of the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and in &s;ummer, driving on the operations of the at|tack. Various was the &s;ucce&s;s, and many were the commanders that directed the &s;iege; &s;ome times all the be&s;iegers works were de&s;troyed, and many of their men cut off by &s;allies from the town; &s;ometimes they were annoyed by an
<PB N="168" REF="179">
army of Veians, who attempted to bring a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from without. A &s;iege &s;o bloody, &s;eem|ed to threaten depopulation to Rome it&s;elf, by draining its forces continually away, &s;o that a law was obliged to be made, for all the bat|chelors to marry the widows of the &s;oldiers who were &s;lain. The tribunes of the people al&s;o did not fail to render this great undertaking &s;till more arduous by their continual murmurs and &s;kill in rai&s;ing di&s;&s;en&s;ions at home. They blamed the commanders, and prohibited the taxes from being rai&s;ed, which were to pay the &s;oldiery; and &s;till more to perplex the &s;enate, they began to make new propo&s;als for pa&s;&s;ing the Agrarian law. Such di&s;&s;en&s;ion among the Romans, and &s;o much ob&s;tinacy on the part of the Veii, be|gan to depre&s;s the &s;anguine expectations of the &s;enate, they trembled for the con&s;equences of &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure expended in an in|effectual &s;iege, therefore willing to &s;trike one vigorous blow before relinqui&s;hing their favou|rite aim, they created Furius Camillus, dicta|tor, and to him was entru&s;ted the &s;ole power of managing the long protracted war. Camil|lus was a man, who without intrigue or any &s;ollicitation had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the fir&s;t emi|nence in the &s;tate: he had been made one of the cen&s;ors &s;ome time before, and was con&s;i|dered as the head of that office; he was after|wards made a military tribune, and had in this
<PB N="169" REF="180">
po&s;t gained &s;everal advantages over the enemy. It was his great courage and abilities in the above offices, that made him thought mo&s;t worthy to &s;erve his country on this pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. Upon his appointment, numbers of the people flocked to his &s;tandard, confident of &s;ucce&s;s under &s;o experienced a commander. He accordingly drew out his forces again&s;t the enemy, and overthrew the Fali&s;ci, one of the little powers confederated again&s;t Rome, with great &s;laughter: the Capenates al&s;o &s;hared the &s;ame fate, and were obliged to beg protection; wherefore, being thus ma&s;ter of the field, he turned all his force to pro&s;ecute the &s;iege of Veii with vigour. Con&s;cious however, that he was unable to take the city by &s;torm, he &s;ecretly wrought a mine into it, with va&s;t labour, which opened into the mid&s;t of the citadel. Certain thus of &s;ucce&s;s, and finding the city incapable of relief, he &s;ent to the &s;enate, de|&s;iring, that all who cho&s;e to &s;hare in the plun|der of Veii, &s;hould immediately repair to the army. Then giving his men directions how to enter at the breach, the city was in&s;tantly filled with his legions, to the amazement and con|&s;ternation of the be&s;ieged, who but a moment before, had re&s;ted in perfect &s;ecurity. Thus, like a &s;econd Troy, was the city of Veii taken, after a ten years &s;iege, and with its &s;poils en|riched the conquerors, while Camillus him&s;elf,
<PB N="170" REF="181">
tran&s;ported with the honour of having &s;ubdued the rival of his native city, triumphed after the manner of the kings of Rome, having his chariot drawn by four milk-white hor&s;es, a di&s;|tinction which did not fail to di&s;gu&s;t the majo|rity of the &s;pectators, as they con&s;idered tho&s;e emblems as &s;acred, and more proper for doing honour to their gods, than their generals.</P>
<P>The people &s;oon after pretended to find &s;till greater cau&s;e of offence. Their tribunes had propo&s;ed, that the &s;enate and people &s;hould di|vide into two parts, whereof, one &s;hould con|tinue in Rome, the other &s;hould &s;ettle at Veii, their new conque&s;t. This, Camillus earne&s;tly oppo&s;ed, and diverted the multitude from their intention, though it procured their anger. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> were they le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed with him &s;oon after, when they found them&s;elves obliged to re&s;tors the tenth part of the plunder they had taken, which, before the &s;iege, he had devoted to Apollo. The &s;oldiers, for the mo&s;t part, had &s;pent theirs long &s;ince, &s;o that they would have been incapable of refunding, had not the Roman women parted with their golden orna|ments, to the amount of eight talents of gold, to &s;upply them. For this generous action, they were decreed the privilege of having funeral orations pronounced over their bodies, which had not been allowed to women before. Ca|millus
<PB N="171" REF="182">
was rendered by this &s;tep, &s;till more un|popular than before.</P>
<P>However, in the mid&s;t of this general di&s;|like, he was, &s;ome time after, created one of the military tribunes, and &s;ent again&s;t the Fali&s;ci, who had been making their accu&s;tomed incur&s;ions upon the Roman territories. His u&s;ual good fortune attended him in this expedi|tion, he routed their army, and be&s;ieged their capital city Falerii, which threatened a long and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. The reduction of this little place, would have been &s;carce worth men|tioning in this &s;canty page, were it not for an action of the Roman general, that has done him more credit with po&s;terity, than all his other triumphs united. A &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who had the care of the children belonging to the principal men of the city, having found means to decoy them into the Roman camp, offered to put them into the hands of Camillus, as the &s;ure&s;t means of inducing the citizens to a &s;peedy &s;urrender. The general was &s;truck with the treachery of a wretch, who&s;e duty it was to protect innocence, and not to betray it; he for &s;ome time regarded the traitor with a &s;tern air, but at la&s;t finding words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Execrable villain, cried the noble Roman, offer thy abominable propo&s;als to creatures like thy&s;elf, and not to me; what though we be the enemies of your city, yet there are natural ties that bind all
<PB N="172" REF="183">
mankind, which &s;hould never be broken: there are duties required from us in war, as well as in peace: we fight now not again&s;t an age of innocence, but again&s;t men. Men who have u&s;ed us ill indeed, but yet, who&s;e crimes are virtues, when compared to thine. Again&s;t &s;uch ba&s;e arts, let it be my duty to u&s;e only Roman arts, the arts of valour and of arms."</Q> So &s;aying, he immediately order|ed him to be &s;tript, his hands tied behind him, and in that ignominious manner, to be whipped into the town by his own &s;cholars. This ge|nerous behaviour in Camillus effected more than his arms could do; the magi&s;trates of the town immediately &s;ubmitted to the &s;enate, leaving to Camillus the conditions of their &s;urrender, who only fined them a &s;um of money to &s;atisfy his army, and received them under the protection and into the alliance of Rome.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the veneration which the virtues of Camillus had excited abroad, they &s;eemed but little adapted to bring over the re|&s;pect of the turbulent tribunes at home, as they rai&s;ed &s;ome fre&s;h accu&s;ation again&s;t him every day. To the charge of being an oppo&s;er of their intended migration from Rome to Veii, they added that of his having concealed a part of the plunder of that city, particularly two brazen gates for his own u&s;e, and appointed him a day, on which to appear before the peo|ple.
<PB N="173" REF="184">
Camillus finding the multitude exa&s;perated again&s;t him upon many pretences, and dete&s;t|ing their ingratitude, re&s;olved not to await the ignominy of a trial, but embracing his wife and children, prepared to depart from Rome. He had already pa&s;&s;ed as far as one of the gates, unattended on his way, and unlamented. There however, he could &s;uppre&s;s his indignation no longer, but turning his face to the Capitol, and lifting up his hands to heaven, he entreated all the gods, that his country might one day be &s;en&s;ible of their inju&s;tice and ingratitude, and &s;o &s;aying, he pa&s;t forward to take refuge at Ardea, a town at a little di&s;tance from Rome, where he afterwards learned, that he had been fined fifteen hundred a&s;&s;es by the tribunes at Rome.</P>
<P>The tribunes were not a little plea&s;ed with their triumph over this great man, but they &s;oon had rea&s;on to repent their inju&s;tice, and to wi&s;h for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one, who alone was able to protect their country from ruin. For now a more terrible and redoubtable enemy began to make its appearance, than the Ro|mans had ever yet encountered: the Gauls, a barbarous nation, had about two centuries be|fore made an irruption from beyond the Alps, and &s;ettled in the northern parts of Italy. They had been invited over by the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of the wines, and the &s;oftne&s;s of the climate. Wherever they came, they di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t the origi|nal
<PB N="174" REF="185">
inhabitants, being men of extraordinary &s;ta|ture, fierce in a&s;pect, barbarous in their man|ners, and prone to emigration. Not content with having &s;ubdued and peopled mo&s;t of the northern parts of Italy, they were &s;till inviting others from their native de&s;arts beyond the Alps, to come over, and &s;pread terror and de|&s;olation in the fruitful regions of this new di&s;co|vered country. A body of the&s;e, wild from their original habitations, were now be&s;ieging Clu|&s;ium, a city of Etruria, under the conduct of Brennus, their king. The inhabitants of Clu|&s;ium frighted at their numbers, and &s;till more at their &s;avage appearance, entreated the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, or at lea&s;t, the mediation of the Romans. The &s;enate, who long had made it a maxim, never to refu&s;e &s;uccour to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, were willing, previou&s;ly to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to the Gauls, to di&s;&s;uade them from their enterprize, and to &s;hew the inju&s;tice of their irruption. Ac|cordingly, three young &s;enators were cho&s;en out of the family of the Fabii, to manage the commi&s;&s;ion, who &s;eemed rather fitter for the field than the cabinet. Brennus received them with a degree of complai&s;ance, that argued but little of the barbarian, and de&s;iring to know the bu&s;ine&s;s of their emba&s;&s;y, was an&s;wered ac|cording to their in&s;tructions, that it was not cu&s;tomary in Italy, to make war, but upon ju&s;t grounds of provocation, and that they de&s;ired
<PB N="175" REF="186">
to know, what offence the citizens of Clu&s;ium had given to the king of the Gauls? To this Brennus &s;ternly replied, that the rights of va|liant men lay in their &s;words; that the Romans them&s;elves, had no other right to the many cities they had conquered; and that he had particular rea&s;ons of re&s;entment again&s;t the peo|ple of Clu&s;ium, as they refu&s;ed to part with tho&s;e lands, which they had neither hands to till, nor inhabitants to occupy. The Roman amba&s;&s;adors, who were but little u&s;ed to bear the language of a conqueror, for a while, di&s;|&s;embled their re&s;entment at this haughty reply, but, upon entering the be&s;ieged city, in&s;tead of acting as amba&s;&s;adors, forgetful of their &s;acred characters, they headed the citizens in a &s;ally again&s;t the be&s;iegers. In this combat, Fabius Ambu&s;tus killed a Gaul with his own hand, but was di&s;covered, while he was de&s;poiling him of his armour. A conduct &s;o unju&s;t and unbecoming, excited the re&s;entment of Bren|nus, who having made his complaint by an he|rald, to the &s;enate, and finding no redre&s;s, im|mediately broke up the &s;iege, and marched away with his conquering army directly to Rome.</P>
<P>The countries through which the Gauls pa&s;|&s;ed, in their rapid progre&s;s, gave up all hopes of &s;afety upon their approach, being terrified at their va&s;t numbers, the fiercene&s;s of their
<PB N="176" REF="187">
natures, and their dreadful preparations for war. But the rage and impetuo&s;ity of this wild people were directed only again&s;t Rome. They went on without doing the lea&s;t injury in their march, &s;till breathing vengeance only again&s;t the Romans.</P>
<P>Six military tribunes at that time commanded the Roman army: the number of their forces, which amounted to forty thou&s;and men, was nearly equal to tho&s;e of Brennus, but the &s;oldiers were le&s;s obedient, and the generals had neither &s;ubordination to a&s;&s;i&s;t, nor confidence to unite each other. The two armies met be&s;ide the river Allia, eleven miles from the city, both equally confident of victory, both equally dreading to &s;urvive a defeat. The leaders on either &s;ide put their forces in array; the Ro|mans, to prevent being &s;urrounded, extended their lines, and placed their be&s;t legions in the wings of their army. The Gauls, on the other hand, by an happy di&s;po&s;ition, had their choice&s;t men in the middle, and with the&s;e they made the mo&s;t de&s;perate attack. The centre of the Roman army, unable to with&s;tand the impetu|o&s;ity of the charge, quickly gave way, while the two wings &s;aw them&s;elves in a manner di|vided from each other, and their centre occu|pied by the enemy. They made, for a time, a feeble attempt to join each other, but finding it impracticable, a rout en&s;ued, in which the
<PB N="177" REF="188">
Romans &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all power, not only of re&s;i&s;tance, but of flight. Nothing but terror and blind confu&s;ion reigned through their &s;cattered troops; the wretched remains of their army, either were drowned in attempting to cro&s;s over the Tyber, or went to take refuge in Veii, while a few of them returned to Rome, with the dreadful account of their country's overthrow. All hopes being now over, the few remaining inhabitants that were able to bear arms, threw them&s;elves into the Capitol, which they fortified, in order to hold out a &s;iege. The re&s;t of the people, a poor, helple&s;s multitude of old men, women and children, endeavoured to hide them&s;elves in &s;ome of the neighbouring towns, or re&s;olved to await the conqueror's fury, and end their lives with the ruin of their native city. But more particu|larly, the ancient &s;enators, and prie&s;ts, &s;truck with a religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, on this occa&s;ion, re&s;olved to devote their lives to atone for the crimes of the people, and habited in their robes of ceremony, placed them&s;elves in the Forum, on their ivory chairs. The Gauls, in the mean time, were giving a loo&s;e to their triumph, in &s;haring and enjoying the plunder of the ene|mies camp; had they immediately marched to Rome upon gaining the victory, the Capitol it&s;elf had been taken; but they continued two days fea&s;ting upon the field of battle, and with
<PB N="178" REF="189">
barbarous plea&s;ure, exulting amid&s;t their &s;laugh|tered enemies. On the third day after the vic|tory, the ea&s;ine&s;s of which much amazed the Gauls, Brennus appeared with all his forces be|fore the city. He was at fir&s;t much &s;urprized to find the gates wide open to receive him, and the walls defencele&s;s, &s;o that he began to im|pute the unguarded &s;ituation of the place, to a &s;tratagem of the Romans. After proper pre|cautions however, he entered the city, and marching into the Forum, there beheld the an|cient &s;enators &s;itting in their order, ob&s;erving a profound &s;ilence, unmoved and undaunted&punc; The &s;plendid habits, the maje&s;tic gravity, and the venerable looks of the&s;e old men, who had all, in their time, borne the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate, awed the barbarous enemy into reverence; they took them to be the tutelar deities of the place, and began to offer blind adoration, till one, more forward than the re&s;t, put forth his hand to &s;troak the beard of Pa|pyrius, whom we have already &s;een enjoying the dignity of dictator. This in&s;ult the noble Roman could not endure, but lifting up his ivory &s;cepter, &s;truck the &s;avage to the ground. This &s;eemed as a &s;ignal for general &s;laughter. Papyrius fell fir&s;t, and all the re&s;t &s;hared his fate, without mercy or di&s;tinction. Thus the fierce invaders pur&s;ued their &s;laughter for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;paring neither &s;ex nor age,
<PB N="179" REF="190">
and then &s;etting fire to the city, burnt down every hou&s;e to the ground.</P>
<P>All the hopes of Rome were now placed in <MILESTONE N="364" UNIT="U. C."> the Capitol, every thing without that fortre&s;s, was but an exten&s;ive &s;cene of mi&s;ery, de&s;ola|tion and de&s;pair. All the magnificent build|ings, which were once the pride of Rome, were now become an heap of &s;hapele&s;s ruin. Nor was it the city alone that felt the utmo&s;t rage of the conquerors, but all the neighbouring towns that were acce&s;&s;ible to their incur&s;ions, &s;hared the &s;ame fate, and were burnt without compa&s;|&s;ion. Still however, the citadel remained, and Brennus tried every art to reduce it into his power; he fir&s;t &s;ummoned it, with threats, to &s;urrender, but in vain; he then re&s;olved to be|&s;iege it in form, and hemmed it round with his army. The Romans however, repelled his at|tempts with great bravery, de&s;pair had &s;upplied them with that per&s;everance and vigour, which they &s;eemed to want when in pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The &s;iege had now continued for above &s;ix months, the provi&s;ions of the garri&s;on were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, their numbers le&s;&s;ened with continual fatigue, and nothing &s;eemed to remain but death, or &s;ubmitting to the mercy of the conquerors, which was wor&s;e even than death it&s;elf. They had re&s;olved upon dying, when they were re|vived from their de&s;pondence, by the appearance of a man whom they &s;aw climbing up the rock,
<PB N="180" REF="191">
and whom they knew upon his arrival, to be a me&s;&s;enger from their friends abroad. This me&s;&s;enger's name was Pontius Comminus, who had &s;wam acro&s;s the Tyber by night, pa&s;&s;ed through the enemies guards, and with extreme &s;atigue, climbed up the Capitoline rock, with tidings to the be&s;ieged, that Camillus, their old dictator, was levying an army for their relief; that he had already &s;urprized a body of the Gauls in one of their excur&s;ions, and had cut them off to a man; that the citizens of Ardea and Veii had armed in his favour, and had made him their general, and that he only awaited their confirmation of the choice, to enter the field, and give the barbarians battle. The Romans were &s;truck with a mixture of rapture and confu&s;ion, to find that the man whom they had formerly &s;purned from the city, was now, in its de&s;perate &s;tate, become its defender. They in&s;tantly cho&s;e him for their dictator, and prepared to &s;u&s;tain the &s;iege with recruited vi|gour. Thus the me&s;&s;enger having received his an&s;wer and proper in&s;tructions, returned the way he came, not without encountering the utmo&s;t difficulties.</P>
<P>In the mean while, Brennus carried on the &s;iege with extreme ardour, he hoped in time to &s;tarve the garri&s;on into a capitulation; but they, &s;en&s;ible of his intent, although they were in actual want, cau&s;ed &s;everal loaves to be
<PB N="181" REF="192">
thrown into his camp, to convince him of the futility of &s;uch expectations. His hopes failing in this, were &s;oon after revived, when &s;ome of his &s;oldiers came to inform him, that they had di&s;covered &s;ome foot-&s;teps which led up to the rock, and by which they &s;uppo&s;ed the Capitol might be &s;urprized. Accordingly, a cho&s;en body of his men were ordered by night upon this dangerous &s;ervice, which they with great labour and difficulty almo&s;t effected: they were now got upon the very wall; the Roman centinel was fa&s;t a&s;leep; their dogs within gave no &s;ignal, and all promi&s;ed an in&s;tant victory, when the garri&s;on was awaked by the gaggling of &s;ome &s;acred gee&s;e, that had been kept in the temple of Juno. The be&s;ieged &s;oon perceived the imminence of their danger, and each &s;natch|ing the weapon he could find in&s;tantly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an to oppo&s;e the a&s;&s;ailants. Manlius, a patrician of acknowledged bravery, was the fir&s;t who ex|erted all his &s;trength, and in&s;pired courage by his example. He boldly mounted the rampart, and at one effort, threw two Gauls headlong down the precipice: others &s;oon came in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the walls were cleared of the enemy, in a &s;pace of time &s;horter than the de&s;cription.</P>
<P>From this time forward, the hopes of the barbarians began to decline, and Brennus wi&s;h|ed for an opportunity of rai&s;ing the &s;iege with
<PB N="182" REF="193">
credit. His &s;oldiers had often conferences with the be&s;ieged, while upon duty, and the propo|&s;als for an accommodation were wi&s;hed for by the common men, before the chiefs thought of a congre&s;s. At length the commanders on both &s;ides came to an agreement, that the Gauls &s;hould immediately quit the city and territories of Rome, upon being paid a thou&s;and pound weight of gold. This agreement being con|firmed by oath on either &s;ide, the gold was brought forth, but upon weighing, the Gauls attempted fraudulently to kick the beam, of which the Romans complaining, Brennus in&s;ulting, ca&s;t his &s;word and belt into the &s;cale, crying out, that the only portion of the vanqui&s;hed was to &s;uffer. By this re|ply, the Romans &s;aw that they were at the victor's mercy, and knew it was vain to expo&s;tulate again&s;t the conditions he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to impo&s;e. But in this very juncture, and while they were thus debating upon the payment, it was told them, that Camillus, their dictator, was at the head of a large army, ha&s;|tening to their relief, and entering the gates of Rome. Camillus accordingly, appeared &s;oon after, and entering the place of controver&s;y, with the air of one who was re&s;olved not to &s;uffer impo&s;ition, he demanded the cau&s;e of the conte&s;t, of which being informed, he ordered the gold to be taken and carried back to the

Capitol, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for it has ever been, cried he, the manner with us Romans to ran&s;om our coun|try, not with gold, but with iron; it is I only that am to make peace, as being the dictator of Rome, and my &s;word alone &s;hall purcha&s;e it."</Q> Upon this, a battle en&s;ued, in which the Gauls were entirely routed, and &s;uch a &s;laughter followed, that the Roman territories were &s;oon cleared of their formidable invaders.</P>
<P>The enemy was now vanqui&s;hed, but Rome continued an heap of ruins; no part of its for|mer magnificence remained, except the Capitol, and the greate&s;t number of its former inha|bitants had gone to take refuge in Veii. The tribunes of the people therefore, the&s;e men unheard of but in the calm of peace, began once more to urge for the removal of the poor remains of Rome to Veii, where they might have hou&s;es to &s;helter, and walls to defend them. On this occa&s;ion, Camillus was &s;teady to his former principles: he attempted to appea&s;e them, with all the arts of per&s;ua&s;ion; ob&s;erv|ing, that it was unworthy of them, both as Romans and as men, to de&s;ert the venerable &s;eats of their ance&s;tors, where they had been encouraged by repeated marks of divine appro|bation, to remove to and inhabit a city which they had conquered, and which wanted even the good fortune of defending it&s;elf. By the&s;e and &s;uch like remon&s;trances, he prevailed upon the
<PB N="184" REF="195">
people to go contentedly to work, and Rome &s;oon began to ri&s;e from its a&s;hes, though with dimini&s;hed beauty.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Camillus were in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, but preparatory to future victories. He was made dictator the next year, upon an irrup|tion <MILESTONE N="369" UNIT="U. C."> of the neighbouring &s;tates, and gained an|other triumph, and about three years after, overthrew the Latins, who had revolted from Rome, after an obedience of more than an hun|dred years continuance. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;erved to render Camillus almo&s;t ab&s;olute in Rome&punc; his moderation and patrioti&s;m however, pre|vented his making a wrong u&s;e of his power, unle&s;s we may con&s;ider his conduct with re|gard to Manlius Capitolinus, as an act of &s;e|verity.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een the bravery of Man|lius in defending the Capitol, and &s;aving the la&s;t remains of Rome. For this the people were by no means ungrateful, having built him an hou&s;e near the place, where his valour was &s;o con&s;picuous, and having appointed him a publick fund for his &s;upport. But his ambi|tion was not to be &s;atisfied with &s;uch trifling rewards; he &s;till a&s;pired at being not only equal to Camillus, but to be &s;overeign of Rome. With this view he laboured to ingratiate him|&s;elf with the populace, paid their debts, and railed at the patricians, whom he called their
<PB N="185" REF="196">
oppre&s;&s;ors. The &s;enate was not ignorant of his di&s;cour&s;es or his de&s;igns, and created Cornelius Co&s;&s;us dictator, under pretext of &s;ending him again&s;t the Vol&s;cians, who had made &s;ome &s;uc|ce&s;sful irruptions into the Roman territories, but in reality, with a view to curb the ambi|tion of Manlius. The dictator &s;oon fini&s;hed his expedition again&s;t the foreign enemy, by a vic|tory, and upon his return, called Manlius to an account, and put him in pri&s;on, for his conduct at home. Manlius however, was too much the darling of the populace, to be affect|ed by the power of Co&s;&s;us; his partizans were too loud in their clamours, to permit any in|jury to be done to their favourite. Co&s;&s;us was obliged to lay down his office, and Manlius was carried from confinement in triumph. This &s;ucce&s;s only &s;erved to enflame his ambition. He now began to talk of a divi&s;ion of the lands among the people; he now in&s;inuated, that there &s;hould be no di&s;tinctions in the &s;tate, and to give weight to his di&s;cour&s;es, he al|ways appeared at the head of a large body of the dregs of the people, whom his large&s;&s;es had made his followers. The city being thus filled with &s;edition and clamour, the &s;enate were obliged to have recour&s;e to another expe|dient, and to oppo&s;e the power of Camillus to his. Camillus accordingly being made one of the military tribunes, appointed Manlius a day
<PB N="186" REF="197">
to an&s;wer for his life. The place in which he was tried was near the Capitol, where, when he was accu&s;ed of &s;edition, and a&s;piring at &s;overeignty, he only turned his eyes thither, and pointing, put them in mind of what he had done for his country there. The multitude, who&s;e compa&s;|&s;ion or who&s;e ju&s;tice &s;eldom &s;pring from ratio|nal motives, refu&s;ed to condemn him, while he pleaded in &s;ight of the Capitol; but when he was brought from thence to the Peteline grove, and where the Capitol was no longer to be &s;een, they condemned him to be thrown head|long from the Tarpeian rock. Thus, the place which had been the theatre of his glory, be|came that of his puni&s;hment and infamy. His hou&s;e, in which his con&s;piracies had been &s;e|cretly carried on, was ordered to be razed to the ground, and his family were forbid ever after to a&s;&s;ume the name of Manlius.</P>
<P>The death of Manlius, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re|newed the murmurs of the tribunes and the people again&s;t Camillus, whom they con&s;idered as the chief in&s;trument of his pro&s;ecution: ever unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves guilty of a &s;eve|rity to which they had given their con&s;ent, they began to turn their re&s;entment upon the mo&s;t worthy man of the &s;tate, as if to aggravate their ba&s;ene&s;s. However, Camillus was never, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to want an opportunity of bringing them back to their veneration for him.
<PB N="187" REF="198">
Being cho&s;en military tribune a &s;ixth time, though much again&s;t his con&s;ent, he, with his colleague Lucius, marched again&s;t the Vol|&s;cians; Lucius, all eagerne&s;s to engage the ene|my, Camillus tempering his courage with mo|deration. This backwardne&s;s for the attack, Lucius a&s;cribed to the timidity of old age, or the envy of a man unwilling to participate his fame: he therefore took the opportunity, when Camillus was &s;ick, and obliged to keep his bed, to lead on his forces to the attack. But he too &s;oon perceived the temerity of his conduct, his army was almo&s;t defeated, and an univer&s;al flight was going to en&s;ue, when Camillus rouzed from his bed, and being helped on hor&s;e-back, old and infirm as he was, he put him&s;elf at the head of a &s;mall body of men, oppo&s;ing tho&s;e that fled, and bringing them once more furiou&s;ly up again&s;t their pur&s;uers. The intrepidity of one man &s;pread it&s;elf through the whole army, his &s;oldiers quickly rallied, re&s;olv|ing never to for&s;ake a general, under whom they had &s;o often fought with victory. The enemy being thus repul&s;ed, the combat was renewed the day following, in which they were totally defeated, and Camillus returned to Rome once more loaden with the &s;poils of conque&s;t. But <MILESTONE N="372" UNIT="U. C."> conque&s;ts abroad &s;eemed only new occa&s;ions for di&s;&s;en&s;ions at home, for the debtors began to complain of their hard&s;hips as formerly. The
<PB N="188" REF="199">
inhabitants of Praene&s;te, a town belonging to the Latins, al&s;o made incur&s;ions upon the Ro|man territories; to quell the&s;e internal and external grievances, Quintius Cincinnatus was cho&s;en dictator, who took Praene&s;te by &s;urren|der, and returned in triumph, with the &s;tatue of Jupiter Imperator, which he placed in the Capitol, a circum&s;tance, which though of little &s;eeming importance, fir&s;t excited the de&s;ire of extending conque&s;t among the Romans.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="375" UNIT="U. C."> Two years after this, the conte&s;ts between the patricians and tribunes broke out with more than u&s;ual violence. Many of the plebeians, during the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country, had either by accident or courage acquired large fortunes, and this produced a de&s;ire of &s;haring, not only in the government, but the honours of Rome. The people, as we have &s;een, had before this a&s;pired at the con&s;ul&s;hip, and the &s;enate, as has been related, by a trifling &s;ubterfuge, granted them military tribunes, which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;ular power; but this it &s;eems was not &s;uffi|cient to &s;atisfy their pride, the tribunes of the people now therefore renewed their claims, while the poorer part of the citizens, only in|tent upon acquiring the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and but little touched with its honours, were calm &s;pectators of the conte&s;t: they only wanted &s;omething to &s;trike the imagination, in order to intere&s;t them in the cau&s;e, and this at la&s;t offered.
<PB N="189" REF="200">
Fabius Ambu&s;tus, a tribune of the people, had two daughters, one of whom he married to a patrician, the other to a plebeian. The ple|beian's wife coming one day to vi&s;it her &s;i&s;ter, was &s;truck with envy at the honours which the latter received, in con&s;equence of her patrician alliance, and from envying fell into a &s;ettled melancholy. Her father and hu&s;band, for a long time, conjured her to tell them the rea&s;ons of this alteration in her di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;he at la&s;t unwillingly revealed. The fa|ther, though him&s;elf a patrician, to comfort his daughter, was prevailed upon to give her a&s;&s;urances, that he would in&s;tantly u&s;e every means in his power, to make her an equal &s;ha|rer in the dignities of the &s;tate, with her &s;i&s;ter, and not to be deficient in his promi&s;e, from that time con&s;ulted with her hu&s;band about pre|ferring a law, for making one con&s;ul out of the body of the people. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to get the hu&s;band elected a tribune of the peo|ple, and then, in order to ingratiate them&s;elves with the multitude, they propo&s;ed, with the &s;ame law which made preten&s;ions to the con&s;ul|&s;hip, that the Agrarian law, for the equal par|tition of lands, &s;hould al&s;o be pa&s;&s;ed; a mea|&s;ure, which they knew, mu&s;t give popularity to their ambition. The conte&s;ts in con&s;equence of this propo&s;al were &s;o violent, that for five <MILESTONE N="377. to 382." UNIT="U. C."> years, no &s;upreme magi&s;trate was cho&s;en, the
<PB N="190" REF="201">
tribunes of the people, and aediles governing all the time, if that might be called govern|ment, which was little better than anarchy and confu&s;ion. The military tribunes then came into government, and after two years were elap&s;ed in this manner, Camillus was cho&s;en <MILESTONE N="384"> dictator, who finding the people re&s;olute in their de&s;igns of chu&s;ing a plebeian con&s;ul, laid down his office. Upon his re&s;ignation, another dicta|tor was cho&s;en by the &s;enate; but this high of|fice had been now &s;o often created where there was no ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, that its authority be|gan to decline, while that of the tribunes ro&s;e upon its ruins. This dictator's name was Man|lius Capitolinus: he &s;eems to have little re|markable in his conduct, if we except his cre|ating Licinius Stolo, his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, who was the fir&s;t plebeian who enjoyed that dignity. Stolo was the fir&s;t al&s;o who cau&s;ed a law to be pa&s;&s;ed, that no man &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s above five hundred acres of land, which was greatly di&s;advantageous to the patricians; but what is &s;till more particular, he was &s;oon after found de&s;irous of privately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more land, than by his own law he was entitled to &s;hare, and in con&s;equence thereof, was puni&s;hed by his own edict.</P>
<P>In this manner the flame of contention was carried on between the two orders of the &s;tate, with acrimony and per&s;everance, while foreign
<PB N="191" REF="202">
enemies only &s;erved to allay, but not to extin|gui&s;h it. Another inva&s;ion of the Gauls to op|po&s;e whom, Camillus was a fifth time made dictator, for a time repre&s;&s;ed and gave a tran|&s;ient pau&s;e to the&s;e internal commotions. The dread of this people was &s;o great among the Romans then, that a law was made, that prie&s;ts &s;hould be excu&s;ed from all wars, unle&s;s in an inva&s;ion of the Gauls. However, Camillus taught his countrymen the way to &s;ubdue them. Being &s;en&s;ible that the chief weapon of this fierce people was the &s;word, he furni&s;hed his &s;oldiers with iron helmets, and had their targets bound round with bra&s;s, and at the &s;ame time, taught them the art of u&s;ing their own arms to the be&s;t advantage. By the&s;e means he rendered the &s;words of the Gauls &s;o un&s;erviceable, that giving them battle near the river Anio, he gain|ed an ea&s;y victory, &s;o that the Romans now be|gan to de&s;pi&s;e the Gauls, and wonder at their own former pu&s;illanimity.</P>
<P>A victory like this, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, would have rendered Camillus ab&s;olute at Rome. But it &s;eems, that whether from his advanced age, or the encrea&s;ing power of the tribunes, he had by this time fallen even from the &s;hare of authority he was once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="U. C."> law for creating a plebeian con&s;ul being &s;till agitated with encrea&s;ing animo&s;ity, the &s;enate as u&s;ual &s;trongly oppo&s;ed it, forbidding Camil|lus
<PB N="192" REF="203">
to lay down his dictator&s;hip, in hopes, that under the influence of his power, they might be able to &s;upport their honour again&s;t the pre|ten&s;ions of the people. In con&s;equence of this, while Camillus was one day &s;itting upon his tribunal, di&s;patching public affairs, the tribunes ordered, that the votes of the people &s;hould be taken upon their favourite mea&s;ure, and upon the dictator's oppo&s;ing, they &s;ent a lictor to ar|re&s;t and conduct him to pri&s;on. Such a mark of indignity offered to a magi&s;trate who had been hitherto held &s;acred, rai&s;ed a greater com|motion than had been hitherto &s;een in Rome. The patricians who &s;tood round the dictator&punc; boldly repul&s;ed the lictors, while the people who &s;tood below, with equal fury cried out, Down with him, Down with him. In this univer&s;al uproar, Camillus was the only per&s;on that &s;eemed unmoved. He entreated that the tri|bunes would give a moment's pau&s;e to their at|tempts; then calling the &s;enators round him, and conducting them to a neighbouring temple, he entreated them to give peace to the city, by their compliance; then turning his face towards the Capitol, as if to take a la&s;t farewel of all future endeavours to &s;erve his country, he vowed to build a temple to Concord, in ca&s;e he &s;aw peace re&s;tored to the people. In con&s;e|quence of his advice, a law was made, that one of the con&s;uls, for the future &s;hould be cho&s;en
<PB N="193" REF="204">
from the plebeians. Sextius, who had long been a turbulent tribune of the people, was the fir&s;t plebeian con&s;ul that was cho&s;en. After him &s;ucceeded Licinius, the hu&s;band of her whom we have already mentioned as langui&s;hing with the de&s;ire of dignity. There were al&s;o at this time, two new magi&s;trates created from among the patricians; namely, a Praetor, who was to &s;upply the place of con&s;ul in the ab&s;ence of that magi&s;trate, and to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to the people, in civil and criminal ca&s;es; an officer &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate, that the number of praetors was, in after ages, encrea&s;ed to &s;ixteen. There were al&s;o two Curule Aediles created, officers &s;o called to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the aediles of the people, the former hav|ing the chair and other en&s;igns of magi&s;tracy attending them, which the latter were denied. Their chief bu&s;ine&s;s was to have the care of the great and public games, and of the corn and provi&s;ions taken in war. Thus Camillus, having &s;pent a long life, being now above eighty, in the &s;ervice of his country, throughout which having &s;hewn a courage not to be &s;haken by danger, and a patrioti&s;m, which even the ingra|titude of the people could not alter, laid down the dictator&s;hip, and built a temple to Concord, according to his vow, which however he &s;ur|vived but two years, dying of the plague, and
<PB N="194" REF="205">
leaving behind him the reputation of being the &s;econd founder of Rome.</P>
<P>It was in vain however, that mea&s;ures were taken to en&s;ure a la&s;ting reconciliation between the patricians and the people: their di&s;putes revived upon every occa&s;ion, for whenever new magi&s;trates were to be cho&s;en, each party try|ing all their intere&s;t to have the election in their own favour, he&s;itated not to u&s;e both fraud and violence to compa&s;s their de&s;ires. Thus the &s;enate &s;u&s;pended all mea&s;ures again&s;t the foreign enemy, le&s;t the plebeian con&s;ul, newly elected, &s;hould come in for a &s;hare of the glory. Thus al&s;o the people &s;oon after ob|tained, by their complaints, to have the curule aediles cho&s;en, every &s;econd year, out of their own body, and even at length prevailed to have Marcus Rutilius, a plebeian, made dictator. <MILESTONE N="39" UNIT="U. C."> To balance this, the year following, the patri|cians took away the con&s;ul&s;hip from the people, after they had enjoyed it ten years, and four years after, they were obliged to re&s;tore it. The election of a cen&s;or produced equal animo&s;ity, and after many conte&s;ts, the plebeian, who had been dictator, was elected to the office, again&s;t the united endeavours of the patricians.</P>
<P>During the&s;e conte&s;ts at home however, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Romans were un|employed, or un&s;ucce&s;sful in their foreign wars. They obtained a &s;ignal victory over the Her|nici,
<PB N="195" REF="206">
&s;o that Claudius Cra&s;&s;inus, the dictator, had <MILESTONE N="392"> the honour of an ovation allowed him by the &s;enate. They obtained another over the Gauls, and Quintus Pennus, the dictator, returned with <MILESTONE N="393"> a triumph. Two &s;ucceeding victories were gained over the &s;ame people by two different dictators, namely, Servilius Ahala, and Sulpi|cius Deticus, who both triumphed in their turn. We read of two other dictators, namely, Man|lius Torquatus, and Caius Julius, who being created without any great nece&s;&s;ity, did little, and con&s;equently &s;erved to le&s;&s;en the authority of the dictator&s;hip. We read of a fourth tri|umph over the Gauls by Furius Camillus, who was created dictator to oppo&s;e them. The Arunci al&s;o, a people beyond the Vol&s;ci, made &s;ome incur&s;ions, but were repul&s;ed by Camillus, who was created dictator a &s;econd time for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor were dictators created only for thus repelling the &s;udden incur&s;ions of the enemy, but for much more trifling purpo&s;es; in the times of a plague we find one created, namely, Manlius Capitolinus, merely to drive a nail, as a means of putting a &s;top to the contagion. This unimportant bu&s;ine&s;s he executed with great ceremony, driving it on the right &s;ide of Jupiter's temple, into the Capitol. Two dicta|tors <MILESTONE N="391"> al&s;o were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cho&s;en, merely to held the Comitium or a&s;&s;embly of the people,
<PB N="196" REF="207">
for a new election of con&s;uls; Furius Camillus and Manlius Torquatus being cho&s;en for the&s;e unimportant purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In this manner therefore, the Romans went gradually forward, with a mixture of turbu|lence and &s;uper&s;tition within their walls, and &s;ucce&s;sful enterprizes without. Their conten|tions at home making their wars abroad le&s;s painful and fatiguing, naturally produced in them a turn to military glory. Their &s;uper&s;ti|tion al&s;o &s;erved as an help to their progre&s;s, for when the bonds of authority no longer prevail|ed, the prie&s;ts were always &s;ure to hold the people by the ties of religion. What an im|plicit obedience they placed in their pontiffs, we have already &s;een in many in&s;tances, and how far they might be impelled, even to en|counter death it&s;elf, at their command, will <MILESTONE N="392"> evidently appear from the behaviour of Cur|tius, about this time, who, upon the opening of a gulph in the Forum, which the gods in|dicated would never clo&s;e up, till the mo&s;t pre|cious thing in Rome was thrown into it, leaped with his hor&s;e and armour in&s;tantly into the mid&s;t, &s;aying, that nothing was more truly valuable than patrioti&s;m and military vir|tue. The gulph, &s;ay the hi&s;torians, clo&s;ed im|mediately upon him, and he was never &s;een more. Such a &s;pirit of religion, and &s;o many advantages by following war, had extended
<PB N="197" REF="208">
their dominions already above double what they were in the times of the kings. However, their principal actions hitherto were again&s;t their neare&s;t neighbours, in which they chiefly acted upon the defen&s;ive; but we are &s;hortly to be|hold another &s;cene, where their ambition catches fire, and is not appea&s;ed, till the limits of the world it&s;elf &s;eems to put bounds to the con|flagration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. From the wars of the Samnites and the wars with Pyrrhus, to the beginning of the fir&s;t Punic war, when the Romans fir&s;t went out of Italy.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to that period, when all the peculiar privileges of patricians were but an empty name, and when wealth chiefly made di&s;tinction. The &s;tate has appeared hitherto an ob&s;cure, unnoted commonwealth, formidable only to the petty nations round it, and &s;trug|gling le&s;s for conque&s;t, than &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But the Romans having now triumphed over the Sabines, the Etrurians, the Latins, the Hernici, the Aequi and the Vol&s;cians, began to look for greater conque&s;ts. They accordingly turned their arms again&s;t the Samnites, a peo|ple about an hundred miles ea&s;t from the city.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="209">
The Samnites were an hardy nation, de&s;cend|ed from the Sabines, inhabiting a large tract of &s;outhern Italy, which at this day makes a con&s;iderable part of the kingdom of Naples. They were equally powerful both in numbers and di&s;cipline, with the Romans, and had like them, confederated &s;tates to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Two &s;uch a&s;piring neighbours, both equally fond of arms and living by war, could not long want a pretext for a rupture. The pretended occa&s;ion of this was, that the Samnites had oppre&s;&s;ed the Sidicini, who being too weak to manage the war alone, called in the Campanians to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who al&s;o being overthrown, implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Rome. The &s;enate for &s;ome time, to give a colour of ju&s;tice to their am|bition, &s;eemed to defer granting aid again&s;t the Samnites, as being their friends and allies: but the importunate entreaties of the Campa|nian amba&s;&s;adors, and the offers of the rich luxurious country which they inhabited, and &s;till more, the refu&s;al of the Samnites to de&s;i&s;t from ravaging a country which the Romans con&s;idered as their own, determined them to undertake the war. Valerius Corvus and Cor|nelius were the two con&s;uls, to who&s;e care it fir&s;t fell to manage this dreadful tontention be|tween rival &s;tates, that for the &s;pace of &s;ixty years after deluged Italy with blood. Valerius was one of the greate&s;t commanders in his
<PB N="199" REF="210">
time; he was &s;urnamed Corvus, from a &s;trange circum&s;tance of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a crow in a &s;ingle combat, in which he fought and killed a Gaul of a gigantic &s;tature. To his colleague's care it was con&s;igned to lead an army to Sam|nium, the enemies capital, while Corvus was &s;ent to relieve Capua, the capital of the Cam|panians. Never was captain more fitted to his &s;oldiers, than he. To an habit naturally ro|bu&s;t and athletic, he joined the gentle&s;t man|ners; he was the fierce&s;t, and yet the mo&s;t good-natured man in the army, and while the meane&s;t centinel was his companion, no man kept them more &s;trictly to their duty; but what completes his character, he con&s;tantly endea|voured to pre&s;erve his dignities, by the &s;ame arts with which he gained them. Such &s;oldiers as the Romans then were, hardened by their late adver&s;ity, and led on by &s;uch a general, were unconquerable. The Samnites were the brave&s;t men they ever yet encountered, and the contention between them was managed on both &s;ides with the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution. But the fortune of Rome prevailed; the Samnites at length fled, averring, that they were not able to with&s;tand the fierce looks and the fire|darting eyes of the Romans. The other con|&s;ul however, was not at fir&s;t &s;o fortunate, for having unwarily led his army into a defile, he was in danger of being cut off, had not Decius,

a tribune in the army, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of an hill which commanded the enemy, &s;o that the Samnites being attacked on either &s;ide, were defeated with great &s;laughter, not le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and of them being left dead in the field of battle.</P>
<P>Soon after, the inhabitants of Capua reque&s;t|ed to have a Roman garri&s;on to winter there, to &s;ecure them from the in&s;ults of the Samnites. Their de&s;ire was accordingly complied with, but Capua was ever noted for being the de|&s;troyer of military di&s;cipline, and for enervat|ing its protectors. It offered &s;o many delights, and gratified &s;o largely all the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, that the Roman garri&s;on began to lo&s;e not only their courage, but their virtue. They formed a de&s;ign of de&s;troying the inhabitants, and tak|ing the town to them&s;elves. This de&s;ign they communicated to their companions in other parts of the country, and they as readily em|braced the propo&s;al. At length however, it came to the notice of the officers, who dete&s;t|ing &s;o much ba&s;ene&s;s, led the legions into the field, and kept them in action, in order to pre|vent their returning to their former de&s;igns. But notwith&s;tanding the care of the general and officers, the &s;oldiers finding them&s;elves lia|ble to the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments for their late perfidious &s;chemes, began to mutiny, and unit|ing them&s;elves into one body, marched directly
<PB N="201" REF="212">
forward for Rome. For &s;ome time they were without a leader, no man being bold enough, or ba&s;e enough to head an army, who&s;e confe|derating principle was treachery. At length they forced Quintius, an old and eminent &s;ol|dier, who was then re&s;iding in the country, to be their leader, and conducted by their rage, more than their general, came within eight miles of the city. So terrible an enemy, almo&s;t at the gates, not a little alarmed the &s;enate, who immediately created Valerius Corvus, dic|tator, and &s;ent him forth with another army to oppo&s;e them. The two armies were now drawn up again&s;t each other, while fathers and &s;ons beheld them&s;elves prepared to engage in oppo|&s;ite cau&s;es. Any other general but Corvus might have brought this civil war to an ex|tremity, but he knowing his influence among the &s;oldiery, in&s;tead of going forward to meet the mutineers in an ho&s;tile manner, went with the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip to embrace his old acquaintance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have had, cried he, my friends, opportunities enough of &s;hewing my valour in war, I now only want to acquire reputation by making peace. You cannot di&s;tru&s;t me, my friends, or think Valerius Corvus can ever be &s;evere, who never yet got one law enacted in the &s;enate, that was contrary to your intere&s;ts. You cannot think he will be &s;evere, who&s;e au&s;terities were ever

But whatever you do, I am re&s;olved to behave as becomes me; if I draw my &s;word, it &s;hall not be till you have drawn yours fir&s;t; if blood mu&s;t be &s;hed, you &s;hall begin the &s;laughter. But whom will you de&s;troy? Not your enemies, not the Samnites or the Vol&s;cians, but your fathers, brothers, children, countrymen, and in the view of the&s;e very mountains that gave you birth and education together. But let it not be &s;o. You, Quintius, if indeed you are the commander of this &s;hameful ex|pedition, have only to a&s;k with rea&s;on, and we will grant with mercy."</Q> The whole ar|my &s;eemed a&s;&s;ected with this &s;peech. Quintius, as their &s;peaker, only de&s;ired to have their de|fection from their duty forgiven; and as for him&s;elf, as he was innocent of their con&s;piracy, he had no rea&s;on to &s;ollicit pardon for any of|fence. Thus, this defection, which at fir&s;t threatened &s;uch dangers to Rome, was repaired by the prudence and moderation of a general, who&s;e ambition it was to be gentle to his friends, and formidable only to his enemies. The mutineers were once more received into favour, and the dictator having no further employment abroad, laid down his office.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="411" UNIT="U. C."> In the mean while, as the war with the Sam|nites was for &s;ome time carried on with various
<PB N="203" REF="214">
&s;ucce&s;s, a peace was concluded, which &s;eemed &s;o offen&s;ive to the Latins and the Campanians, that it induced them to revolt. The former carried their demands &s;o far as to in&s;i&s;t, that one of the con&s;uls and half the &s;enate &s;hould be cho&s;en out of their body, before they would &s;ubmit to think of peace. The Romans at fir&s;t tried by gentle means to turn them from their purpo&s;e; but they in&s;i&s;ted upon it &s;till more re|&s;olutely, a&s;cribing the lenity of Rome to its fears. In order therefore to cha&s;tize them, the two con&s;uls, Manlius Torquatus, and his col|league, Decius Mus, were &s;ent by the &s;enate to invade their country. However, the Latins were not remi&s;s in their preparations for a de|fence, &s;o that the two armies met with equal animo&s;ity, and a bloody and ob&s;tinate battle en|&s;ued. In this battle, the &s;trict di&s;cipline of the Romans, and their amazing patrioti&s;m were di&s;played, in a manner that has excited rather the wonder, than the admiration of po&s;terity. As the Latins and Romans were a neighbour|ing people, and their habits, arms, and language were the &s;ame, the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to prevent confu&s;ion in the engagement. Orders therefore were i&s;&s;ued by Manlius the con&s;ul, that no &s;oldier &s;hould leave his ranks upon whatever provocation, and that he &s;hould be certainly put to death, who offered to do otherwi&s;e. With the&s;e injunctions, both armies
<PB N="204" REF="215">
were drawn out in array, and ready to begin, when Metius, the general of the enemies caval|ry, pu&s;hed forward from his lines, and chal|lenged any knight in the Roman army, to &s;in|gle combat. For &s;ome time there was a general pau&s;e, no &s;oldier offering to di&s;obey his orders, till Titus Manlius, the con&s;ul's &s;on, burning with &s;hame, to &s;ee the whole body of the Ro|mans intimidated, boldly &s;ingled out again&s;t his adver&s;ary. The &s;oldiers on both &s;ides, for a while, &s;u&s;pended the general engagement, to be &s;pectators of this fierce encounter. The two champions drove their hor&s;es again&s;t each other with great violence: Metius wounded his ad|ver&s;ary's hor&s;e in the neck, but Manlius, with better fortune, killed that of Metius. The La|tin being thus fallen to the ground, for a while attempted to &s;upport him&s;elf upon his &s;hield, but the Roman followed his blows with &s;o much force, that he laid him dead, as he was endeavouring to ri&s;e, and then de&s;poiling him of his armour, returned in triumph to the con&s;ul, his father's tent, where he was prepar|ing and giving orders relative to the engage|ment. How&s;oever he might have been ap|plauded by his fellow &s;oldiers, being as yet doubtful of the reception he &s;hould find from his father, he came with he&s;itation, to lay the enemy's &s;poils at his feet, and with a mode&s;t air in&s;inuated, that what he did, was entirely from

a &s;pirit of hereditary virtue. But he was &s;oon dreadfully made &s;en&s;ible of his error, when his father, turning away, ordered him to be led publickly forth before the army. Here being brought forward, the con&s;ul, with a &s;tern coun|tenance, and yet with tears, &s;poke as follows, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Titus Manlius, as thou ha&s;t regarded neither the dignity of the con&s;ul&s;hip, nor the com|mands of thy father, as thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed military di&s;cipline, and &s;et a pattern of di&s;|obedience by thy example, thou ha&s;t reduced me to the deplorable extremity of &s;acrificing my &s;on or my country. But let us not he&s;i|tate in this dreadful alternative, a thou&s;and lives were well lo&s;t in &s;uch a cau&s;e; nor do I think, that thou thy&s;elf will refu&s;e to dye, when thy country is to reap the advantage of thy &s;ufferings. Go, Lictor, bind him, and let his death be our future example."</Q> The whole army was &s;truck with horror at this un|natural mandate; fear, for a while, kept them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, but when they &s;aw their young champion's head &s;truck off, and his blood &s;treaming upon the ground, they could no longer contain their execrations, and their groans. His dead body was carried forth with|out the camp, and being adorned with the &s;poils of the vanqui&s;hed enemy, it was buried with all the pomp of military di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="217">
In the mean time, the battle joined with mu|tual fury, and as the two armies had often fought under the &s;ame leaders, they combated with all the animo&s;ity of a civil war. The La|tins chiefly depended on their bodily &s;trength, the Romans on their invincible courage and conduct. Forces &s;o nearly matched, &s;eemed only to require the protection of their deities, to turn the &s;cale of victory, and in fact, the augurs had foretold, that whatever part of the Roman army &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;t, the commander of that part &s;hould devote him&s;elf for his coun|try, and die as a &s;acrifice to the immortal gods. Manlius commanded the right wing, and De|cius led on the left. Both &s;ides fought for &s;ome time with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, as their courage was equal; but, after a time, the left wing of the Roman army began to give ground. It was then that Decius, who commanded there, re|&s;olved to devote him&s;elf for his country, and to offer his own life, as an atonement to &s;ave his army. Thus determined, he called out to Manlius with a loud voice, and demanded his in&s;tructions, as he was the chief Pontiff, how to devote him&s;elf, and the form of the words he &s;hould u&s;e. By his directions therefore, be|ing cloathed in a long robe, his head covered, and his arms &s;tretched forward, &s;tanding upon a javelin, he devoted him&s;elf to the cele&s;tial and infernal gods, for the &s;afety of Rome.
<PB N="207" REF="218">
Then being armed and on hor&s;eback, he drove furiou&s;ly into the the mid&s;t of the enemies, carrying terror and con&s;ternation wherever he came, till he fell covered with wounds. In the mean time, the Roman army con&s;idered his devoting him&s;elf in this manner, as an a&s;&s;ur|ance of &s;ucce&s;s: nor was the &s;uper&s;tition of the Latins le&s;s powerfully influenced by his re&s;olu|tion, a total route began to en&s;ue, the Romans pre&s;&s;ed them on every &s;ide, and &s;o great was the carnage, that &s;carce a fourth part of the enemy &s;urvived the defeat. This was the la&s;t battle of any con&s;equence, that the Latins had with the Romans; they were forced to beg a peace upon hard conditions, and two years af|ter, their &s;tronge&s;t city Paedum being taken, they were brought into an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Roman power.</P>
<P>The Samnites however, were &s;till uncon|quered; a peace had been made with them &s;ome time before, which neither &s;ide &s;eemed long inclined to pre&s;erve. Their giving a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the Campanians, who had formerly begged the protection of the Romans again&s;t them, and now entreated theirs again&s;t Rome, renewed a war, which, though intermitted by various treaties and &s;u&s;pen&s;ions, was to end only with the ruin of the &s;tate. For &s;ome time in|deed, the fate of either nation &s;eemed uncertain, for though the Samnites were in general wor&s;t|ed,
<PB N="208" REF="219">
a &s;ignal di&s;grace which the Romans &s;u&s;tain|ed <MILESTONE N="431"> about this time, made a pau&s;e in their u&s;ual good fortune, and turned the &s;cale for a while, in the enemies favour. The &s;enate having de|nied the Samnites peace, Pontius, their general, was re&s;olved to gain by &s;tratagem, what he had frequently lo&s;t by force. Accordingly, leading his army to a defile, called Claudium, and tak|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its outlets, he &s;ent ten of his &s;oldiers, habited like &s;hepherds, with direc|tions to throw them&s;elves in the way the Ro|mans were to march. Exactly to his wi&s;hes, the Roman con&s;ul met them, and taking them for what they appeared, demanded the route the Samnite army had taken: they, with &s;eem|ing indifference replied, that they were gone to Luceria, a town in Apulia, and were then ac|tually be&s;ieging it. The Roman general not &s;u&s;pecting the &s;tratagem that was laid again&s;t him, marched directly by the &s;horte&s;t road, which lay through the defiles, to relieve the city, and did not find him&s;elf deceived, till he &s;aw his army &s;urrounded, and blocked up on every &s;ide. The Samnites having the Roman army at this great di&s;advantage, immediately &s;ent off to Herennius, their general's father, for in&s;tructions how to proceed. The old crafty Samnite, who knew the di&s;po&s;ition of the Ro|mans, and that a fierce enemy was either to be entirely vanqui&s;hed or entirely won, advi&s;ed his
<PB N="209" REF="220">
&s;on, either indi&s;criminately to the &s;word, or to di&s;mi&s;s them all without &s;hame or injury; urg|ing at the &s;ame time, that one of the&s;e two ways was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; the fir&s;t would incapacitate them from future annoyance, the la&s;t would lay them under an obligation, which they could never remove. This coun&s;el, though the mo&s;t prudent that could be imagined, was rejected; a middle way was taken, which only &s;erved to exa&s;perate the Romans, but not to &s;ubdue them. Pontius fir&s;t obliged their army to pa&s;s under the yoke, having been previou&s;ly &s;tript of all but their under garments; he then &s;tipu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ated, that they &s;hould wholly quit the ter|ritories of the Samnites, and that they &s;hould continue to live upon terms of former confe|deracy. The Romans were con&s;trained to &s;ub|mit to this ignominious treaty, and marched into Capua di&s;armed, half-naked, and burning with a de&s;ire of retrieving their lo&s;t honour. When the army arrived at Rome, the whole city was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ingly afflicted at their &s;hameful return. Nothing but fury and revenge appeared on every face, while the con&s;uls, who were the unfortunate in&s;truments of their di&s;|grace, refu&s;ed to appear abroad, or to perform the nece&s;&s;ary functions of their office. A dic|tator was cho&s;en, who had no opportunity of acting; he laid down his office, and the &s;tate continued for &s;ome time without any &s;upreme

magi&s;trate at its head; nothing but grief and re&s;entment was to be &s;een, and the whole city was put into mourning.</P>
<P>But this was but a tran&s;itory calamity, the &s;tate had &s;uffered a diminution of its glory, but not of its power; it only therefore &s;ought an opportunity of breaking a compact, which the army had made merely by compul&s;ion. The two con&s;uls who had entered into this treaty of|fered them&s;elves up to the enemy, as being the only per&s;ons that could be called to account: but Pontius who ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that the lives of two men were not an equivalent for tho&s;e of an army, refu&s;ed to receive the forfeit, and &s;ent them back, greatly exclaiming again&s;t the per|fidiou&s;ne&s;s of Rome. The war was now there|fore renewed, and the Samnites overthrown in &s;everal battles, the Romans &s;erving them, as they them&s;elves had been treated before. The&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es produced a truce of two years, which when expired, the war was carried on as u&s;ual, for many years; the power of the Samnites declining every day, while the Romans ga|thered fre&s;h confidence from every victory. Un|der the conduct of Papyrius Cur&s;or, who was at different times con&s;ul and dictator, repeated tri|umphs were gained. Fabius Maximus al&s;o had his &s;hare in the glory of conquering them, and Decius, the &s;on of that Decius, whom we have &s;een devoting him&s;elf for his country, about
<PB N="211" REF="222">
forty years before, followed the example of his noble father, and ru&s;hing into the mid&s;t of the enemy, &s;aved the lives of his countrymen by the lo&s;s of his own. It may &s;eem indeed &s;trange, how the Samnites could &s;o long conti|nue to make head again&s;t the Roman power, but we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that they were aided by all the little &s;tates round them, who were ei|ther attached to them by intere&s;t, or united by a jealou&s;y of Rome's growing greatne&s;s. Thus the Tarentines, the Lucani, the Thurini, and all the &s;outhern &s;tates of Italy, by turns, &s;ent a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which for a while checked the progre&s;s of the conquerors. But their &s;top was of &s;hort dura|tion: both they, as well as the Samnites, after repeated defeats, &s;aw them&s;elves at la&s;t &s;tripped of their cities, and the greate&s;t part of their country: they &s;aw them&s;elves, at the end of a long war, quite exhau&s;ted, near two hundred thou&s;and of their brave&s;t men being killed in battle. In this di&s;tre&s;s, as the Italian &s;tates were unable to defend them&s;elves, they were obliged to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a foreign power, and had recour&s;e to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, to &s;ave them from impending ruin.</P>
<P>Pyrrhus, a king of great courage, ambition and power, had always kept the example of Alexander, his great predece&s;&s;or, before his eyes: he was reckoned the mo&s;t experienced general of his time, and commanded a body of
<PB N="212" REF="223">
troops, then &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t di&s;ciplined of all the nations round them. The Romans were now therefore no longer to combat with a tumultuary force, rai&s;ed in times of exigence, and depending on their courage alone for victo|ry: they were to oppo&s;e an army levied among&s;t the mo&s;t poli&s;hed people then exi&s;ting, formed under the greate&s;t generals, and led on by the mo&s;t noted commander of his time. Pyrrhus, as was &s;aid, having been applied to for &s;uccour by the Tarentines, who in the name of all the declining &s;tates of Italy, conjured him to &s;ave them from the threatening di&s;tre&s;s, promi&s;ed to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the mean time he di&s;patched over a body of three thou&s;and men, under the command of Cineas, an experienced &s;oldier, and a &s;cholar of the great orator De|mo&s;thenes. Nor did he him&s;elf remain long behind, but &s;oon after put to &s;ea with three thou&s;and hor&s;e, twenty thou&s;and foot, and twenty elephants, in which the commanders of that time began to place very great confidence. Only a &s;mall part however, of the&s;e great pre|parations arrived in Italy with him, for many of his &s;hips were di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;ome totally lo&s;t in a tempe&s;t. Upon his arrival at Tarentum, his fir&s;t care was to reform the people he came to &s;uccour; for ob&s;erving a total di&s;&s;olution of manners in this luxurious city, and how the in|habitants were rather occupied with the plea|&s;ures
<PB N="213" REF="224">
of bathing, fea&s;ting, and dancing, than in preparing for war; he gave orders to have all their places of public entertainment &s;hut up, and that they &s;hould be re&s;trained in all the&s;e amu&s;ements that render &s;oldiers unfit for battle. He attempted to repre&s;s their licentious manner of treating their governors, and even &s;ummoned &s;ome who had mentioned his own name with ridicule, to appear before him. However, he was prevented from puni&s;hing them by their ingenuous manner of confe&s;&s;ing the charge. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, cried they, we have &s;poken all this again&s;t you, and would have &s;aid &s;till more, but that we had no more wine."</Q> But though he forgave them with a &s;mile, he took the mo&s;t prudent precautions to guard him&s;elf again&s;t their well-known in&s;incerity; &s;ending his &s;on out of the city, and removing all tho&s;e he &s;u&s;|pected mo&s;t forward to promote &s;edition. In the mean time, the Romans did all that pru|dence could &s;ugge&s;t, to oppo&s;e &s;o formidable an enemy, and the con&s;ul Laevinus was &s;ent with a numerous army to interrupt his progre&s;s. Where|fore Pyrrhus, though his whole army was not yet arrived, drew out to meet him, but previ|ou&s;ly &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador, de&s;iring to be per|mitted to mediate between the Romans and the people of Tarentum. To this Laevinus returned for an&s;wer, that he neither e&s;teemed him as a mediator, nor feared him as an enemy, and
<PB N="214" REF="225">
then leading the amba&s;&s;ador through the Ro|man camp, de&s;ired him to ob&s;erve diligently what he &s;aw, and report the re&s;ult to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>War being thus determined on either part, both armies approaching, pitched their tents in &s;ight of each other, upon the oppo&s;ite banks of the river Lyris. Pyrrhus was always extremely careful in directing the &s;ituation of his own camp, and in ob&s;erving that of the enemy. It was here, that walking along the banks of the river, and &s;urveying the Roman method of encamp|ing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e barbarians, cried he, turning to one of his favourites, &s;eem to me to be no way barbarous, and I fear, we &s;hall too &s;oon find their actions equal to their re&s;olution."</Q> However, ordering a body of men along the banks of the river, he placed them in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e the Romans, in ca&s;e they &s;hould at|tempt to ford it before his whole army was brought together. Things turned out accord|ing to his expectations; the con&s;ul, with an impetuo&s;ity that marked his inexperience, gave orders for pa&s;&s;ing the river, where it was ford|able, and the Epirean advanced-guard having attempted to oppo&s;e him in vain, were obliged to retire to the main body of their army. Pyr|rhus being apprized of the enemies attempt, at fir&s;t hoped to cut off their cavalry, before they could be reinforced by the foot, that were not as yet got over, and led on in per&s;on a cho&s;en
<PB N="215" REF="226">
body of hor&s;e again&s;t them. It was on this occa&s;ion, that he &s;hewed him&s;elf equal to his great reputation: he was con&s;tantly &s;een at the head of his men, leading them on with &s;pirit, yet directing them with calmne&s;s; at once per|forming the office of a general, and the duty of a common &s;oldier, he &s;hewed the greate&s;t pre|&s;ence of mind joined to the greate&s;t valour. He was chiefly con&s;picuous by the noblene&s;s of his air, and the richne&s;s of his armour, &s;o that wherever he appeared, the throng of the battle was gathered round him. In the mid&s;t of the engagement his hor&s;e happening to be killed under him, he was obliged to change armour with one of his attendants, and go to another part of the combat, that required his imme|diate pre&s;ence. Mean while, the Roman knights mi&s;taking this attendant for the king him&s;elf, le|velled all their attempts that way, and at la&s;t &s;lew him, and carried his armour to the con&s;ul. The report being &s;pread through both armies, that the king was &s;lain, the Greeks were &s;truck with a general panic, and the Romans began to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of victory. But Pyrrhus in the in|&s;tant came bareheaded into the van, and repeat|edly crying out, that he &s;till lived, he in&s;pired his &s;oldiers with new vigour. At length the Roman legions had advanced acro&s;s the river, and the engagement was become general; the Greeks fought with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their former

fame, and the Romans with a de&s;ire of gaining fre&s;h glory: mankind had never before &s;een two &s;uch differently di&s;ciplined armies oppo&s;ed to each other, nor is it to this day determined, whether the Greek phalanx or the Roman l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|gion were preferable. The combat was long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; the Romans had &s;even times repul&s;ed the enemy, and were as often driven back them|&s;elves, but at length, while the &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed doubtful, Pyrrhus &s;ent his elephants into the mid&s;t of the engagement, and the&s;e turned the &s;cale of victory in his favour. The Romans had never before &s;een creatures of &s;uch magnitude, they were terrified not only with their intrepid fiercene&s;s, but with the ca&s;tles which were built upon their backs, filled with armed men; they con&s;idered them, rather as prodigies &s;ent to de|&s;troy, than as animals trained up to &s;ubdue them. But not only the men, but the hor&s;es &s;hared in this general con&s;ternation, neither en|during the &s;mell nor the cries of the&s;e formi|dable creatures, but throwing their riders, they filled the ranks with confu&s;ion. It was then that Pyrrhus &s;aw the day was his own, and &s;ending in his The&s;&s;alian cavalry to charge the enemy in di&s;order, the rout became general. A dreadful &s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ghter of the Romans en&s;ued, fifteen thou|&s;and men being killed on the &s;pot, and eighteen hundred taken pri&s;oners. Nor were the con|querors much in a better &s;tate than the van|qui&s;hed,

Pyrrhus him&s;elf being wounded, and thirteen thou&s;and of his forces &s;lain. Night coming on put an end to the &s;laughter on both &s;ides, and Pyrrhus was heard to cry out, that one &s;uch victory more would ruin his army. The next day, as he walked to view the field of battle, he could not help regarding with admi|ration, the bodies of the Romans which were &s;lain: upon &s;eeing them all with their wounds before, their countenances, though even in death, marked with noble re&s;olution, and a &s;ternne&s;s that awed him into re&s;pect; he was heard to cry out in the true &s;pirit of a military adventurer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O with what ea&s;e could I con|quer the world, had I the Romans for &s;ol|diers, or had they me for their king."</Q> The Romans were highly plea&s;ed with this politene&s;s in an enemy, but &s;till more with his civil treat|ment, and his courte&s;y to the pri&s;oners he had taken; complai&s;ance to the captives, was a degree of refinement the Romans were yet to learn from the Greeks; but it was only &s;uffi|cient to &s;hew this brave people an improve|ment, either in morals or war, and they imme|diately &s;et about imitation.</P>

Rome. However, he was &s;till unwilling to drive them to an extremity, and finding them making great preparations, he con&s;idered, that it was be&s;t treating with an enemy after having gained a victory over them; he re&s;olved there|fore to &s;end his friend Cineas, the orator, to ne|gotiate, and u&s;e all his arts to induce them to peace. He had long repo&s;ed great confidence in the abilities and per&s;ua&s;ive powers of this &s;cholar of Demo&s;thenes, and often a&s;&s;erted, that he had won more towns by the eloquence of Cineas, than by his own arms. The old crafty Grecian readily undertook the emba&s;&s;y, and enter|ing Rome, began his negotiation, by attempting to influence not only the &s;enators, but even their wives, by pre&s;ents which he &s;aid were &s;ent them by his ma&s;ter. This however, was the age of Roman virtue; the &s;enators refu&s;ed to accept the&s;e bounties, which they con&s;idered as bribes to betray their country, and the women were not behind their hu&s;bands in their noble di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. They bade him give back to his ma&s;ter tho&s;e allurements to trea&s;on, adding, that they would then only accept his offers, when the &s;enate had con&s;idered whether they &s;hould ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">pt his terms of peace.

level with tho&s;e of the people, began to &s;eek di&s;tinction from virtue only, and de&s;pi&s;ed tho&s;e riches which could not be encrea&s;ed &s;o as to place them at a di&s;tance from the vulgar. Thus Cineas, with all his art, found the Romans im|practicable, either by bribery or private per&s;ua|&s;ion: finding therefore, the&s;e methods ineffec|tual, he proceeded to his commi&s;&s;ion more pub|lickly, and was, at his reque&s;t, introduced to the &s;enate. Here he began by extolling his ma&s;ter's courage and clemency; his de&s;ire of patronizing the brave, and his particular e&s;teem for the Romans. He proceeded to inculcate the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and the fine opportunity the &s;enate then had of re&s;toring it. He offered, in his ma&s;ter's name, to return all that had been lately taken in battle, without ran&s;om; to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Romans on any future occa&s;ion; and all that was a&s;ked in return, was their alliance and friend&s;hip, together with per|mi&s;&s;ion to have the Tarentines included in the treaty. The&s;e offers, and &s;till more the orator's eloquence appeared to touch the whole a&s;&s;em|bly; a general inclination &s;eemed to prevail in favour of the king's propo&s;al, and a peace was confidently talked of in every part of the city. In this juncture, Appius Claudius, an old &s;e|nator, who was now grown blind with age, and had long di&s;continued public bu&s;ine&s;s, cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried into the hou&s;e in a
<PB N="220" REF="231">
litter. The &s;urprize of &s;eeing him in the &s;enate again, and numberle&s;s infirmities which he ap|peared to &s;urmount in coming, awed the whole a&s;&s;embly into &s;ilence and attention.  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ng," cried he, rai&s;ing him&s;elf from his couch, "con&s;idered my blindne&s;s and my in|firmities as evils; thought that heaven had been willing to puni&s;h my old age, for the faults I had committed when young, and had repaid a youth of folly with an age of pain, but now, con&s;cript fathers, I find that I have been peculiarly indulged in what I con|&s;idered as calamities, &s;ince my lo&s;s of &s;ight has hindered me from &s;eeing the late di&s;|honour of my country. Nay, might I make a wi&s;h, it &s;hould be for deafne&s;s al&s;o, and then I &s;hould no longer hear of what mu&s;t now excite indignation in the brea&s;t of every virtuous Roman. How different are you now from what you were &s;ome years ago! Alexander, whom the world has called Great, was then thought nothing of in Rome; we then univer&s;ally a&s;cribed his con|que&s;ts not to his valour but his fortune. You then wi&s;hed that the tide of war might have brought him into Italy, only to &s;hew the world your own &s;uperior prowe&s;s. But how are you fallen at pre&s;ent! You then wi&s;hed to combat with the conqueror of Greece, and now you fear to engage one of tho&s;e

&s;tates which he actually conquered. You de|&s;ired to cope with Alexander, and yet you refu&s;e to meet one who has left his native country, rather through a fear of his ancient enemies, than a de&s;ire of finding new. We have therefore but this alternative, either boldly to meet Pyrrhus in the field, or to be content to &s;uffer all the contempt the neigh|bouring &s;tates of Italy &s;hall throw upon us, and thus by endeavouring to avoid one war, engage our&s;elves in an hundred."</Q> This &s;peech was received with univer&s;al approbation; the a&s;&s;embly grew warm in the prai&s;es of their rough old orator, and the &s;mooth orations of Cineas were heard no more. Being therefore unable to make any progre&s;s in his emba&s;&s;y, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with an an&s;wer intimating, that when Pyrrhus &s;hould withdraw his forces from Italy, that then the Senate would treat with him concerning peace.</P>
<P>Cineas being thus fru&s;trated in his expecta|tions, returned to his ma&s;ter, extolling both the virtues and the grandeur of the Romans. The &s;enate, he &s;aid, appeared a reverend a&s;&s;em|bly of demi-gods, and the city a temple for their reception. Of this Pyrrhus &s;oon after be|came &s;en&s;ible, by an emba&s;&s;y from Rome, con|cerning the ran&s;om and exchange of pri&s;oners. At the head of this venerable deputation was Fabricius, an ancient &s;enator, who had long
<PB N="222" REF="233">
been a pattern to his countrymen of the mo&s;t extreme poverty, joined with the mo&s;t chearful content. This practical philopher, who had been formerly con&s;ul, and was now the amba&s;|&s;ador of Rome, had no other plate furniture in his hou&s;e, except a &s;mall cup, the bottom even of which was of horn. His daughters being without fortunes, the &s;enate generou&s;ly por|tioned them from the public trea&s;ury. When the Samnites had formerly offered him large pre&s;ents, he refu&s;ed them, &s;aying, that he was already rich, as he had learned the art of le&s;|&s;ening his wants by retrenching his appetites. Pyrrhus received this celebrated old man with great kindne&s;s, and willing to try how far fame had been ju&s;t in his favour, offered him rich pre&s;ents, which however the Roman refu&s;ed; the day after, he was de&s;irous of examining the equality of his temper, and ordered one of his elephants to be placed behind the tape&s;try, which upon a &s;ignal given, rai&s;ed its trunk above the amba&s;&s;ador's head, at the &s;ame time u&s;ing other arts to intimidate him. Fabricius however, with a countenance no way changing, &s;mile&punc; upon the king, ob&s;erving, that he looked wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> an equal eye on the terrors of this day, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> had upon the aliurements of the preceding<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pyrrhus plea&s;ed to find &s;o much virtue in on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had con&s;idered as a barbarian, was willin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to grant him the only favour which he kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

could make him happy. He relea&s;ed the Ro|man pri&s;oners, intru&s;ting them to Fabricius alone, upon his promi&s;e, that in ca&s;e the &s;enate were determined to continue the war, he might reclaim them whenever he thought proper.</P>
<P>By this time the Roman army was recovered <MILESTONE N="474" UNIT="U. C."> from its late defeat, and Sulpicius and Decius, the con&s;uls for the following year, were placed at its head. The panic which had formerly &s;eized it from the elephants, now began to wear off, and the generals, with great a&s;&s;idui|ty, applied them&s;elves to imitate the di&s;cipline of Pyrrhus, and the Grecian method of en|campment. It was in this manner they always adopted the improvements of other nations, and learned by defeat the power of becoming invin|cible. Both armies met near the city A&s;culum, both pretty nearly equal in numbers, being about forty thou&s;and &s;trong. Pyrrhus found him&s;elf incommoded by a woody country, that prevented his phalanx and elephants from being &s;o &s;erviceable as in the plain, he therefore con|tinued for &s;ome time rather upon the defen|&s;ive, until night &s;hould give him time to make a more advantageous di&s;po&s;ition. The next morning he cau&s;ed a detachment of his cavalry to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the upper grounds, and thus force the enemy into the plain, which when they had &s;ucce&s;sfully effected, he brought down his elephants into the thicke&s;t of the
<PB N="224" REF="235">
fight, and mixing his &s;lingers and archer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> among them, formed a body that the Ro|mans were &s;carce able to re&s;i&s;t; be&s;ides, not having the advantages of advancing and retreat|ing, as the day before, the battle became clo&s;e and general. The Roman legions at fir&s;t were unable to pierce the Greek phalanx, but at length, carele&s;s of their own lives, they made a de&s;perate &s;laughter among them. In fine, after a long and ob&s;tinate fight, the Grecian di&s;cipline prevailed, and the Romans being pre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, particularly by the ele|phants, were obliged to retire to their camp, leaving &s;ix thou&s;and men dead upon the field of battle. But the enemy had no great rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their triumph, as they had four thou|&s;and &s;lain, &s;o that Pyrrhus replied to one of his &s;oldiers who was congratulating him upon his victory, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one &s;uch triumph more, and I &s;hall be undone."</Q> Nor was he unju&s;t in the a&s;&s;er|tion, as by this time, the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e forces which had followed him from home were de&s;troyed, and his friends and generals were mo&s;tly cut off.</P>
<P>This battle fini&s;hing the campaign, the next &s;ea&s;on began with equal vigour on both &s;ides. Pyrrhus having received new &s;uccours from home, while old Fabricius, who was made con&s;ul with Aemilius, led on the Romans, no way di&s;couraged by their former defeat. While
<PB N="225" REF="236">
the two armies were approaching, and yet but a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, a letter was brought to Frabricius from the king's phy&s;i|cian, importing, that for a proper reward, he would take him off by poi&s;on, and thus rid the Romans of a powerful enemy and a dangerous war. Fabricius felt all the hone&s;t indignation at this ba&s;e propo&s;al, that was con&s;onant with his former character, he communicated it to his colleague, and in&s;tantly gave it as his opi|nion, that Pyrrhus &s;hould be informed of the treachery that was plotted again&s;t him. Ac|cordingly, letters were di&s;patched for that pur|po&s;e, informing Pyrrhus of his unfortunate choice of friends and enemies. That he had tru&s;ted and promoted villains, while he carried his re&s;entment again&s;t the generous and the and the brave. Pyrrhus now began to find that the&s;e bold barbarians were by degrees &s;chooling into refinement, and would not &s;uffer him to be their &s;uperior even in genero&s;ity: he received the me&s;&s;age with equal amazement at their candour, and indignation at his phy&s;ician's treachery. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Admirable Fabricius! cried he, it would be as ea&s;y to turn the &s;un from its cour&s;e, as thee from the paths of honour."</Q> Then making the proper enquiry among his &s;ervants, and having di&s;covered the trea&s;on, he ordered his phy&s;ician to be executed. However, not to be outdone in magnanimity, he immedi|ately
<PB N="226" REF="237">
&s;ent to Rome all his pri&s;oners without ran|&s;om, and again de&s;ired to negotiate a peace. The Romans, on the other hand, refu&s;ed him peace, but upon the &s;ame conditions as they had offered before, and relea&s;ed as many of the Samnites and Tarentines as equalled the number of the pri&s;on|ers they had received. The king was a good deal a&s;toni&s;hed at the Roman ob&s;tinacy; he appeared divided between &s;hame and nece&s;&s;ity, his cir|cum&s;tances obliging him in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to di&s;continue the war, while his honour was hurt in being compelled to leave it unfini&s;hed. However, an invitation from the Sicilians, begging relief again&s;t the Carthaginians, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their i&s;land, and treated them cruelly, relieved him from his embarra&s;&s;ment. This expedition promi&s;&s;ed more rewards and le&s;s labour, and &s;uch were the chief objects of this military rambler's attention. He therefore placed a garri&s;on in Tarentum, much again&s;t the inclination of the inhabitants, and then &s;ending his friend Cineas before him, followed with all the re&s;t of his forces to relieve Sicily.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Samnites and Taren|tines being left to the mercy of the Romans, continued to &s;ollicit him with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplications, to return to protect them. Pyr|rhus, whom his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Sicily had for &s;ome time made deaf to their entreaties, was, after a lap&s;e of two years &s;pent in ineffectual victory,
<PB N="227" REF="238">
glad to have a &s;pecious pretext to leave this country al&s;o, as he had formerly left Italy. He therefore, with &s;ome difficulty, once more re|turned to Tarentum, at the head of twenty thou&s;and foot and three thou&s;and hor&s;e. The Romans, though pre&s;&s;ed by &s;o formidable a power as that of Pyrrhus, had not yet forgot|ten the ancient animo&s;ity between the orders of the &s;tate, and upon a levy being &s;et forward to form an army to oppo&s;e him, &s;everal of the people refu&s;ed to enli&s;t. In order to repre&s;s a &s;edition which threatened nothing le&s;s than the de&s;truction of the empire&punc; the con&s;uls re&s;olved to act with &s;pirit, and accordingly commanded that the names of the citizens &s;hould be drawn by lot, and that he who fir&s;t refu&s;ed to take the field, &s;hould be &s;old as a &s;lave. This timely &s;everity had its effect, and whenever after any man refu&s;ed to enli&s;t when called upon, he was in&s;tantly treated by the con&s;uls in that manner. Having thus rai&s;ed a &s;ufficient body of forces, the con&s;uls divided their army into two parts&punc; and marched into the enemies coun|try, one into Lucania, and the other among the Samnites. Pyrrhus having encrea&s;ed his his army al&s;o by new levies, and being inform|ed of this, divided his forces al&s;o, and &s;ent one part to oppo&s;e the march of Lentulus, while he him&s;elf went to attack Curius Dentatus, be|fore his colleague could come up. His prin|cipal
<PB N="228" REF="239">
aim was to &s;urprize the enemy by night, but unfortunately pa&s;&s;ing through woods, and his lights failing him, his men lo&s;t their way, &s;o that at the approach of morning, they &s;aw them&s;eves in &s;ight of the Roman camp, with the enemy drawn out ready to receive them. The vanguard of both armies &s;oon met, in which the Romans had the advantage. Soon after a general engagement en&s;uing, Pyrrhus finding the ballance of the victory turning &s;till again&s;t him, had once more recour&s;e to his ele|phants. The&s;e however, the Romans were now too well acquainted with, to feel any vain ter|rors from, and having found, that fire was the mo&s;t effectual means to repel them, they cau&s;ed numbers of balls to be made, compo&s;ed of flax and ro&s;in, which were thrown again&s;t them as they approached the ranks. The elephants thus rendered furious by the flame, and as boldly oppo&s;ed by the &s;oldiers, could no longer be brought on, but ran back on their own ar|my, bearing down their ranks, and filling all places with terror and confu&s;ion. Thus victory at length declared in favour of Rome: Phr|rhus in vain attempted to &s;top the flight and the &s;laughter of his troops; he lo&s;t not only twenty-three thou&s;and of his be&s;t &s;oldiers, but his camp was al&s;o taken. This &s;erved as a new le&s;&s;on to the Romans, who were ever open to improvement: they had formerly pitched
<PB N="229" REF="240">
their tents without order, but by this, they were taught to mea&s;ure out their ground, and fortify the whole with a trench, &s;o that many of their &s;ucceeding victories may be a&s;cribed to their improved method of encamping.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the two con&s;uls were entering triumphant into Rome, Pyr|rhus bore his defeat with unbroken courage; his fir&s;t care was to &s;ecure a retreat, and then to keep up the &s;pirits of his ailies, with pro|mi&s;es of better &s;ucce&s;s for the future. This he old till he had tried the utmo&s;t of what his in|tere&s;t could do, to furni&s;h out another campaign. However, finding all hopes of that fruitle&s;s, he re&s;olved to leave Italy, where he had found only de&s;perate enemies and faithle&s;s allies. Accord|ingly, calling together the Tarentines, he in|formed them, that he had received a&s;&s;urances from Greece, of &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and de&s;iring them to expect the event with tranquillity: the night following he embarked his troops, and returned undi&s;turbed into his native kingdom, with the remains of his &s;hattered forces; fir&s;t leaving a garri&s;on in Tarentum, merely to &s;ave appearances. In this manner ended the war with Pyrrhus, after &s;ix years continuance. Thro' the whole of this, we find the Romans acting a nobler part than in any former period, en|deavouring to join the politene&s;s of Greece to the virtuous au&s;terity of their own manners.
<PB N="230" REF="241">
A &s;pirit of frugality, contempt of wealth, and virtuous emulation had &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole &s;enate. Fabricius not only brought po|verty into fa&s;hion by his example, but puni&s;h|ed all approaches to luxury, by his authority as a magi&s;trate. About this time, in the cen|&s;or&s;hip of Fabricius, Ruffinus, who had been twice a con&s;ul and once a dictator, was turned out of the &s;enate, and had a mark of infamy put upon his name, for no other offence, than being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten pound of &s;ilver plate for the u&s;e of his table. By this love of temper|ance, and the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war, though the individuals were poor, the public was rich; the number of citizens al&s;o was encrea&s;ed to above two hundred thou&s;and men, capable of bearing arms, and the fame of the Roman name was &s;o far extended, that Ptolomy Phila|delphus, king of Egypt, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to congratulate their &s;ucce&s;s, and to entreat their alliance. As for the poor luxurious Tarentines, who were the original promoters of this war, they &s;oon began to find a wor&s;e enemy in the garri&s;on that was left for their defence, than in the Romans who attacked them from without. The hatred between them and Milo, who commanded their citadel for Pyrrhus, was be|come &s;o great, that nothing but the fear of their old inveterate enemies the Romans, could equal it. In this di&s;tre&s;s they applied to the Car|thaginians,
<PB N="231" REF="242">
who with a large fleet came and blocked up the port of Tarentum; &s;o that this unfortunate people, who once were famous through Italy for their refinements and plea|&s;ures, now &s;aw them&s;elves contended for by three different armies, while they were not even left the choice of a conqueror. At length, however, the Romans found means to bring over the garri&s;on to their intere&s;t, after which, they ea&s;ily became ma&s;ters of the city, and de|moli&s;hed its walls, granting the inhabitants li|berty and protection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. From the beginning of the fir&s;t Punic war to the beginning of the &s;econd, when the Romans be|gan to grow powerful by &s;ea.</HEAD>
<P>THE Romans had now de&s;troyed all rival <MILESTONE N="489" UNIT="U. C."> preten&s;ions in Italy; the Tarentines, the Sam|nites, the Lucanians were now no more, or patiently took laws from the conquerors. Their victory over Pyrrhus not only gave them repu|tation abroad, but kindled an ambition for fo|reign conque&s;t. They began al&s;o to know, though not to practi&s;e the refinements of the Greeks and Tarentines, whom they had con|quered; the number of their hu&s;bandmen di|mini&s;hed,
<PB N="232" REF="243">
while, as in all &s;tates becoming opu|lent, their artizans and gentry continually en|crea&s;ed. The environs of the city were now therefore no longer able to furni&s;h their grow|ing numbers with corn, and &s;upplies were brought from the kingdoms abroad. Of the&s;e, Sicily &s;ent by far the greate&s;t proportion, &s;o that the people began &s;ecretly to wi&s;h for the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a country, which had for &s;ome time &s;erved as the granary of Rome. To minds pre|di&s;po&s;ed for conque&s;t, a pretext to begin is &s;el|dom wanting. The Carthaginians were at that time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of Sicily, and, like the Romans, only wanted an opportu|nity of embroiling the natives, in order to be|come ma&s;ters of the whole i&s;land. This op|portunity had now offered; Hiero, king of Sy|racu&s;e, one of the &s;tates of the I&s;land as yet un|conquered, entreated their aid again&s;t the Ma|mertines, a little people of the &s;ame country, and they &s;ent him &s;upplies both by land and &s;ea. The Mamertines, on the other hand, to &s;hield off impending ruin, put them&s;elves under the protection of Rome. The Romans how|ever, not thinking the Mamertines worthy of the name of allies, in&s;tead of profe&s;&s;ing to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them, boldly declared war again&s;t Carthage, alledging as a rea&s;on, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Car|thage had lately lent to the &s;outhern parts of Italy again&s;t the Romans. In this manner a
<PB N="233" REF="244">
war was declared between the&s;e two powerful &s;tates, who were both grown too great to con|tinue patient &s;pectators of each others encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Carthage, a colony of the Phaenicians, was built on the coa&s;t of Africa, near the place where Tunis now &s;tands, about an hundred and thirty-&s;even years before the foundation of Rome. As it had been long growing into power, &s;o it had extended its dominions all along the coa&s;ts, and was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion al&s;o of many of the principal I&s;lands in the Mediterranean &s;ea. But its chief &s;trength lay in its fleets and com|merce; by the&s;e its riches were become im|men&s;e, and by their money alone, they were capable of hiring and &s;ending forth armies to conquer or to keep their neighbours under &s;ub|jection. However, as they had now been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of affluence, the &s;tate began to feel the evils that wealth is too apt to produce; for as at Rome, public employments were made the reward of virtue only, and &s;uperior honour only rai&s;ed to a preference of toils, &s;o in Car|thage, the &s;everal offices which the &s;tate had to be&s;tow, were venal, and tho&s;e who purcha&s;ed them, only aimed at being reimbur&s;ed by all the &s;ordid arts of peculation. Thus unequally matched, the&s;e two great powers began what was called the fir&s;t Punic war; the Carthagi|nians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gold and &s;ilver, which might be exhau&s;ted; the Romans of per&s;everance, pa|trioti&s;m,
<PB N="234" REF="245">
and poverty, which &s;eemed to gather &s;trength by every defeat.</P>
<P>As the Romans had been hitherto &s;hut up in their own dominions, they had but little knowledge of the method of tran&s;porting an army by &s;ea. Appius Claudius was the fir&s;t, who by means of a feeble fleet, or, as &s;ome will have it, a raft of timber, carried over a &s;mall body of forces into Sicily, where victory, as u&s;ual, was &s;till attendant upon the fortune of Rome. A league made with Hiero, king of Syracu&s;e, &s;oon after the con&s;ul's arrival, began to in&s;pire the Romans with hopes of expelling the Carthaginians from the I&s;land, and becom|ing ma&s;ters of it in their turn. But &s;till there &s;eemed an un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to their ambitious views; they had no fleet, or at lea&s;t what de&s;erved that title, while the Carthagini|ans being ma&s;ters of a very powerful one, had the entire command at &s;ea, and kept all the maritime towns under their obedience. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, any people but the Romans, would have re&s;ted contented, under di&s;advantages which nature &s;eemed to have impo&s;ed, but no|thing could conquer or intimidate them. They began to apply them&s;elves to maritime affairs, and though without &s;hipwrights to build, or &s;eamen to navigate a fleet, yet they re&s;olved to &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle with inflexible per&s;e|verance. A Carthaginian ve&s;&s;el happened to be
<PB N="235" REF="246">
in a &s;torm driven a&s;hore, and this was &s;uffi|cient to give the Romans hopes of building ve&s;&s;els, that might one day control the long e&s;tabli&s;hed naval power of the Carthaginians. Accordingly, they diligently &s;et about imitat|ing this &s;hip, which was in it&s;elf, little better than a wreck, building an hundred and twenty more according to the model before them. But now, although they had &s;omething like a fleet, which though clum&s;y and ill adapted for &s;ail|ing, was of &s;ome force, they &s;till wanted &s;ailors to manage it. As for the Romans them&s;elves, being bred up to hu&s;bandry, they were per|fectly ignorant of maritime affairs; and the neighbouring &s;tates whom they had lately con|quered, were either unwilling to embark, or not to be relied on. In this exigence, they taught their men to row upon land, in&s;truct|ing them in the naval manner of engaging, as well as they could, leaving it to their native valour to do the re&s;t. The con&s;ul Duillius was the fir&s;t who ventured to &s;ea with this new con|&s;tructed armament; but he &s;oon however, found, that the enemy was every way &s;uperior in point of &s;ailing, and bringing on their ve&s;|&s;els to an engagement. But the indefatigable &s;pirit of the Romans was not to be &s;ubdued; he found out a remedy even here, by inventing an in&s;trument, which, upon an impul&s;e of two &s;hips, kept them both grappled together, &s;o
<PB N="236" REF="247">
that neither could &s;eparate, until courage had decided the victory. By this, a naval engage|ment became more like one at land; &s;o that when the two rival fleets met, the Romans had the victory, the Carthaginians lo&s;ing fifty of their &s;hips, and the undi&s;turbed &s;overeignty of the &s;ea, which they valued more. The&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es were &s;o unexpected by the &s;enate, that Duillius their admiral obtained a &s;ignal triumph, with orders, that whenever he went out to &s;up|per, there &s;hould be a band of mu&s;ic to attend him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the conte&s;t was carried on by land in Sicily with various &s;ucce&s;s, the Ro|mans, as well as their enemies, having &s;ome|times the wor&s;t of the campaign. But the con|duct of both nations, during the continuance of this war, was manife&s;tly different. The Carthaginians appeared always murmuring again&s;t their generals and admirals, and &s;ome|times puni&s;hed them with death, for want of &s;ucce&s;s. The Romans went on &s;till contented and per&s;evering, and &s;eemingly as ea&s;y under a defeat, as happy when victorious. Their chief &s;ucce&s;&s;es during the latter part of the war in Sicily, were owing to the conduct and courage of their con&s;ul Regulus, who &s;ubdued the i&s;lands Lippara and that of Melita, &s;o celebrated at this day for being the re&s;idence of the knights of Malta. The city of Agrigentum in Sicily,
<PB N="237" REF="248">
and of Alberia in Cor&s;ica, were al&s;o attached to the conque&s;ts of Rome.</P>
<P>But the&s;e trifling &s;ucce&s;&s;es were by no means &s;ufficient to gratify the &s;anguine expectations of the people; for though the Carthaginians were &s;ometimes defeated even at &s;ea, yet they &s;till continued mo&s;t powerful there, and &s;ent in &s;up|plies to the i&s;land at plea&s;ure. The conque&s;t therefore of Sicily, was only to be obtained by humbling the power of Carthage at home. For this rea&s;on, the &s;enate re&s;olved to carry the war into Africa it&s;elf, and accordingly they &s;ent Re|gulus and Manlius, with a fleet of three hundred &s;ail, to make the inva&s;ion. Regulus was reck|oned the mo&s;t con&s;ummate warrior, that Rome could then produce: he was a profe&s;&s;ed exam|ple of frugal &s;everity, but le&s;s au&s;tere to others than to him&s;elf; he only reprehended tho&s;e faults, which he would have died rather than have committed: his patrioti&s;m was &s;till greater than his temperance; all the private pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed extingui&s;hed in him, or they were all &s;wallowed up in one great ruling affection, the love of his country. The two generals &s;et &s;ail with their fleet, which was the greate&s;t that had ever yet left an Italian port, carrying an hundred and forty thou&s;and men. They were met by the Carthaginians, with a fleet as powerful, and men better u&s;ed to the &s;ea. While the fight continued, rather between the &s;hips than the
<PB N="238" REF="249">
men, at a di&s;tance, the Carthaginians &s;eemed &s;ucce&s;sful; but when the Romans came to grapple with them, the difference between a mercenary army, and one that fought for fame, was apparent. The re&s;olution of the Romans was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; the enemies fleet were di&s;per&s;ed, and fifty-four of their ve&s;&s;els taken. The con&s;equence of this victory was an immediate de&s;cent upon the coa&s;ts of Africa, and the capture of the city Clupea, together with twenty thou&s;and men who were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The &s;enate being informed of the&s;e great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and applied to for fre&s;h in&s;tructions&punc; commanded Manlius back to Italy, in orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;uperintend the Sicilian war, and directed that Regulus &s;hould continue in Africa, to pro&s;ecute his victories there, but as his con&s;ul|&s;hip was expiring, they continued him their general under the title of Procon&s;ul.

fury, but they &s;oon fell victims to their ra&s;h|ne&s;s, being either killed by its devouring jaws, or cru&s;hed to pieces by the windings of its tail. The poi&s;onous vapour that i&s;&s;ued from it, made it &s;till more formidable, and the men were &s;o much terrified at its appearance, that they a&s;&s;ert|ed, they would much more joyfully have faced the whole Carthaginian army. For &s;ome time it &s;eemed uncertain which &s;hould remain ma&s;ters of the river, as from the hardne&s;s of its &s;cales, no ordinary efforts could drive it away. At la&s;t, Regulus was obliged to make u&s;e of the ma|chines employed in battering down the walls of cities. Notwith&s;tanding, the &s;erpent, for a long time, with&s;tood all his efforts, and de|&s;troyed numbers of his men; but at length, a very large &s;tone which was flung from an en|gine, happened to break its &s;pine, and de&s;troyed its motion: by the&s;e means the &s;oldiers &s;ur|rounded and killed it. Regulus, not le&s;s plea&s;ed with his victory than if he had gained a battle, ordered its &s;kin to be &s;ent to Rome, where it continued to be &s;een till the times of Pliny.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Carthaginians finding the Romans proceeding towards their very capital, brought out a con&s;iderable army to oppo&s;e them. A battle en&s;ued, in which Carthage was once more defeated, and &s;ome of its be&s;t troops were cut off. This fre&s;h victory contributed to throw them into the utmo&s;t de&s;pair; more
<PB N="240" REF="251">
than eighty of their towns &s;ubmitted to the Romans. The Numidians, their ancient allies, ro&s;e again&s;t them at the &s;ame time, and com|bined to ravage the country. The pea&s;ants who fled on every &s;ide, flocked into Carthage, as to the only place of refuge, and brought with them only mi&s;ery and famine. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the Carthaginians, de&s;titute of generals at home who had abilities to oppo&s;e the conqueror, were obliged to &s;end to Lacedemon, offering the command of their armies to Xantippus, a com|mander of great experience, who undertook to conduct them. They, at the &s;ame time, di&s;|patched &s;ome of the principal men of the &s;tate to Regulus to beg a peace. The Roman ge|neral had long wi&s;hed to terminate the war, and go back to his native country. He had even &s;ent to the &s;enate &s;ome time before, de|manding a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and leave to return, in con&s;equence of an account he had received, in|forming him, that his &s;teward who cultivated his e&s;tate, which con&s;i&s;ted but of &s;even acres, was dead, and that his &s;ervant had &s;tolen all the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry that were u&s;ed in its cultivation. He informed the &s;enate, that while he was leading on the armies of the &s;tate, his wife and children were in danger of wanting bread; and that his little dome&s;tic affairs re|quired his pre&s;ence at home. The &s;enate upon this, ordered a &s;ufficient maintenance for his
<PB N="241" REF="252">
wife and children; furni&s;hed his e&s;tate with proper in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, at the public expence, and gave him orders to continue at the head of the army. When the Carthaginians therefore &s;ent propo&s;als of peace, he was very much inclined to come to treaty; but in &s;ome mea&s;ure, con&s;idering him&s;elf as ma&s;ter of Car|thage, he thought it was his duty to dictate the terms. The&s;e were, that Carthage &s;hould give up all the cities they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in Sicily and Sardinia; that they &s;hould deliver up all their pri&s;oners without reward, and at the &s;ame time, ran&s;om tho&s;e that were made of their own. The&s;e and &s;ome other conditions of the &s;ame nature were offered, but the Carthaginians thinking them too rigid, the treaty broke off, and both &s;ides prepared for war.</P>
<P>Xantippus, the Lacedemonian general, was arrived by this time, and gave the magi&s;trates proper in&s;tructions for levying their men: he a&s;&s;ured them, that their armies were hitherto overthrown, not by the &s;trength of the enemy, but the ignorance of their own generals: he therefore only required a ready obedience to his orders, and a&s;&s;ured them of an ea&s;y victory. The whole city &s;eemed once more revived from de&s;pondence, by the exhortations of a &s;ingle &s;tranger, and &s;oon, from hope, grew into confi|dence. This was the &s;pirit the Grecian general wi&s;hed to excite in them, &s;o that when he
<PB N="242" REF="253">
&s;aw them thus ripe for the engagement, he joy|fully took the field. The forces on both &s;ides were but few; the Carthaginian army con&s;i&s;t|ing only of twelve thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e; tho&s;e of the Romans, of about the &s;ame, or rather a &s;uperior number. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance which alarmed Regulus, was to find the enemy alter their plan of encamp|ment, and make a new choice of their ground. They had hitherto cho&s;en the mo&s;t woody and unequal places, where their cavalry were em|barra&s;&s;ed, and their elephants utterly un&s;ervice|able. They now continually kept in the open country, and &s;o harra&s;&s;ed the Roman army, that at length, Regulus was obliged to de&s;cend into the plain, and cro&s;s the river to give them bat|tle. The Lacedemonian made the mo&s;t &s;kill|ful di&s;po&s;ition of his forces; he placed his ca|valry in the wings, he di&s;po&s;ed the elephants at proper intervals, behind the line of heavy|armed infantry, and bringing up the light-arm|ed troops before, he ordered them to retire through the line of infantry, after they had di&s;|charged their weapons. This was a mo&s;t ma&s;|terly di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;uch as was u&s;eful to the Romans in &s;ucceeding engagements, though it was fatal to them in this. For now both ar|mies engaging, after a long and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;t|ance, the Romans were overthrown with dread|ful &s;laughter, the greate&s;t part of their army
<PB N="243" REF="254">
being de&s;troyed, and Regulus him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner. A victory &s;o great and unexpected, filled the &s;treets of Carthage with ungovernable joy; they could never &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy them|&s;elves with gazing on the conqueror, though he was but &s;mall of &s;tature, and of a very mean appearance. But this di&s;po&s;ition was but of &s;hort continuance, for &s;oon their admiration was turned into envy. They could not bear to owe to a &s;tranger that &s;afety, which they wanted abilities and virtue to procure for them&s;elves. Xantippus however, who knew their malignity, and who never much prided him&s;elf upon their barbarous prai&s;e, was de&s;irous of le&s;&s;ening their malevolence, by removing the cau&s;e: he there|fore reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to return home, and de&s;ired a &s;hip for that purpo&s;e. Their ingrati|tude on this occa&s;ion, if hi&s;torians &s;ay true, was even more &s;hocking than their former an|tipathy, for pretending to furni&s;h him with the mo&s;t honourable conveyance, the mariners had private orders to throw him and his companions overboard, le&s;t the honour of obtainnig &s;o great a victory &s;hould be taken from them, to be a&s;cribed to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>However this may be, the affairs of the Car|thaginians, for &s;ome time, went on to improve, while tho&s;e of Rome &s;eemed to be declining. The remains of the Roman army were be&s;ieged in Clupea, a city on the coa&s;ts of Africa, which Regulus had taken, and though it was for a
<PB N="244" REF="255">
while relieved by means of a naval victory, under the conduct of Aemilius Paulus; yet they were obliged to evacuate the place. Soon after the Ro|mans lo&s;t their whole fleet in a &s;torm; and Agri|gentum, their principal town in Sicily, was taken by Karthalo, the Carthaginian general. The Ro|mans, not ea&s;ily to be deterred, undertook to build a new fleet, which al&s;o &s;hared the fate of the former: the mariners as yet unacquainted with the Mediterranean &s;hores, drove it upon quick&s;ands; and &s;oon after, the greate&s;t part peri&s;hed in a &s;torm. Thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in every naval attempt, they, for a while, gave up all hopes of rivalling the Carthaginians at &s;ea, and placed all their hopes in the conque&s;t of Sicily, which they in a great mea&s;ure effected. Mean time, the Carthaginians being now more &s;ucce&s;sful than when they had formerly made propo&s;als of peace, were de&s;irous of a new trea|ty, hoping to have better terms than tho&s;e in|&s;i&s;ted upon before. They therefore re&s;olved to &s;end to Rome to negotiate this bu&s;ine&s;s, or at lea&s;t to procure an exchange of pri&s;oners. For this purpo&s;e they &s;uppo&s;ed, that Regulus, whom they had now for four years kept in a dungeon confined and chained, would be a proper &s;olli|citor. It was expected, that being wearied with impri&s;onment and bondage, he would gladly endeavour to per&s;uade his countrymen to a di&s;continuance of the war, which only prolong|ed
<PB N="245" REF="256">
his captivity. He was accordingly &s;ent with their amba&s;&s;adors to Rome, but with a promi&s;e previou&s;ly exacted from him, to return in ca&s;e of being un&s;ucce&s;sful. He was even given to under&s;tand, that his life depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition.</P>
<P>When this old general, together with the am|ba&s;&s;adors of Carthage, approached Rome, num|bers of his friends came out to meet and congra|tulate his return. Their acclamations re&s;ounded through the city, but Regulus refu&s;ed with &s;et|tled melancholy to enter the gates. It was in vain that he was entreated on every &s;ide to vi&s;it once more his little dwelling, and &s;hare in that joy which his return had in&s;pired. He per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying, that he was now but a &s;lave belonging to the Carthaginians, and unfit to partake in the liberal honours of his country. The &s;enate a&s;&s;embling without the walls, as u&s;ual, to give audience to the enemies amba&s;&s;adors, Regulus opened his commi&s;&s;ion as he had been directed by the Carthaginian council, and their amba&s;|&s;adors &s;econded his propo&s;als. The &s;enate were, by this time, them&s;elves weary of a war, which had been protracted above eight years, and were no way di&s;inclinable to a peace. It &s;eemed the general opinion, that the enmity between the two &s;tates had continued too long, and that no terms &s;hould be refu&s;ed, which would not only give re&s;t to the two nations, but liberty to an
<PB N="246" REF="257">
old general, whom the people reverenced and loved. It only remained for Regulus him&s;elf to give his opinion, who, when it came to his turn to &s;peak, to the &s;urprize of all the world, gave his voice for continuing the war. He a&s;|&s;ured the &s;enate, that the Carthaginian re&s;ources were now almo&s;t exhau&s;ted; their populace harra&s;&s;ed out with fatigues, and their nobles with contention: that all their be&s;t generals were pri&s;oners with the Romans, while Car|thage had none but the refu&s;e of the Roman army: that not only the intere&s;t of Rome, but its honour al&s;o was concerned in continuing the war, for their ance&s;tors had never made peace till they were victorious. So unexpected an ad|vice not a little di&s;turbed the &s;enate; they &s;aw the ju&s;tice of his opinion, but they al&s;o &s;aw the dangers he incurred by giving it: they &s;eemed entirely &s;atisfied of the expediency of prolong|ing the war; their only ob&s;tacle was how to &s;ecure the &s;afety of him, who had advi&s;ed its continuance: they pitied, as well as admired a man who had u&s;ed &s;uch eloquence again&s;t his private intere&s;t, and could not conclude upon a mea&s;ure which was to terminate in his ruin. Regulus however, &s;oon relieved their embarra&s;|ment by breaking off the treaty, and ri&s;ing in order to return to his bonds and confinement. It was in vain that the &s;enate and all his deare&s;t friends entreated his &s;tay, he &s;till repre&s;&s;ed their
<PB N="247" REF="258">
&s;olicitations. Maria his wife, with her little children, filled the city with her lamentations, and vainly entreated to be permitted to &s;ee him: he &s;till ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in keeping his promi&s;e, and though he was &s;ufficiently appriz|ed of the tortures that awaited his return, with|out embracing his family, or taking leave of his friends, he departed with the amba&s;&s;adors for Carthage. Nothing could equal the fury and the di&s;appointment of the Carthaginians, when they were informed by their amba&s;&s;adors, of Regulus, in&s;tead of ha&s;tening a peace, having given his opinion for continuing the war. Fir&s;t, his eyelids were cut off, and then he was re|manded to pri&s;on. He was, after &s;ome days, brought out and expo&s;ed with his face oppo&s;ite the burning &s;un. At la&s;t, when malice was fatigued with &s;tudying all the arts of torture, he was put into a barrel &s;tuck full of nails that pointed inwards, and in this painful po&s;ition he continued till he died.</P>
<P>Both &s;ides now took up arms with more than former animo&s;ity. The Romans, who were in|flexible in their purpo&s;es, although they had &s;o many times been wrecked at &s;ea, and had lo&s;t &s;uch numbers of their brave&s;t troops there, once more fitted out a fleet, and again bid defiance to Carthage. It &s;eemed however, as if fortune was re&s;olved to drive them from this un&s;table element, for by the bad conduct
<PB N="248" REF="259">
of Claudius Pulcher their con&s;ul, and by other various di&s;a&s;ters, their fleet was de&s;troyed like all the former, and the Romans &s;eemed drained of every re&s;ource to furni&s;h out a new one. In con|&s;equence of this, they were obliged to ab&s;tain for &s;even years from all naval preparations. But their &s;pirit was not to be broken, they yet again re&s;olved to build another fleet, and to try their wayward fortune in forming a naval power. At length, their per&s;everance was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, one victory followed on the back of another. Fabius Buteo the con&s;ul &s;hewed them the way, by defeating a large &s;quadron of the enemies &s;hips; but Lutatius Catulus gained a victory &s;till more complete, in which the power of Carthage &s;eemed totally de&s;troyed at &s;ea, by the lo&s;s of an hundred and twenty &s;hips, accord|ing to the &s;malle&s;t computation. This lo&s;s brought them to &s;ue for peace, which Rome thought proper to grant; but &s;till inflexible in its demands, exacted the &s;ame conditions which Regulus had formerly offered at the gates of Carthage. The&s;e were, that the Carthaginians &s;hould lay down a thou&s;and talents of &s;ilver, to defray the charge of the war; and &s;hould pay two thou&s;and, two hundred more, in ten years time: that they &s;hould quit Sicily, with all &s;uch i&s;lands as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed near it: that they &s;hould never make war again&s;t the allies of Rome, or come with any ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="249" REF="260">
of war within the Roman dominions: and la&s;tly, that all their pri&s;oners and de&s;erters &s;hould be delivered up without ran&s;om; to the&s;e hard conditions, the Carthaginians, now exhau&s;ted, readily &s;ub&s;cribed, and thus ended the fir&s;t Punic war, which had la&s;ted twenty|four <MILESTONE N="513" UNIT="U.

To the&s;e a compo&s;ition of a higher kind &s;ucceeded, which they called &s;atire; which was a kind of dramatic poem, in which the characters of the great were particularly pointed out, and made an object of deri&s;ion to the vul|gar. After the&s;e, came tragedy and comedy, which were borrowed from the Greeks, and in|deed, the fir&s;t dramatic poet of Rome, who&s;e <MILESTONE N="514" UNIT="U. C."> name was Livius Andronicus, was by birth a Grecian. The in&s;tant the&s;e finer kinds of com|po&s;ition appeared, this great people rejected their former impurities with di&s;dain. From thenceforward they laboured upon the Grecian model, and though they were never able to ri|val their ma&s;ters in dramatic compo&s;ition, they &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in many of the more &s;oothing kinds of poetry. Elegaic, pa&s;toral, and didactic compo&s;itions, began to a&s;&s;ume new beauties in the Roman language; and &s;atire, not that rude kind of dialogue already men|t oned, but a nobler &s;ort, invented by Lucillius, was all their own.</P>
<P>While they were thus admitting the arts of peace, they were not unmindful of making fre&s;h preparations for war; all intervals of ea&s;e &s;eemed rather to give fre&s;h vigour for new de|&s;igns, than to relax their former intrepidity. The Illyrians were the fir&s;t people upon whom they tried their &s;trength, after &s;ome continuance of <MILESTONE N="527"> peace. That nation, which had long plundered

the merchants of the Mediterranean with im|punity, happened to make deprad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ions upon &s;ome of the trading &s;ubjects of Rome. This being complained of to Teuta, the queen of the country, &s;he, in&s;tead of granting redre&s;s, ordered the amba&s;&s;ador that was &s;ent to demand re&s;titution, to be murdered. A war en&s;ued, in which the Romans were victorious. Mo&s;t of the Illyric towns were &s;urrendered to the con|&s;uls, and a peace at la&s;t concluded, by which the greate&s;t part of the country was ceded to Rome; a yearly tribute exacted for the re&s;t, and a prohibition added, that the Illyrians &s;hould not &s;ail beyond the river Li&s;&s;us, with more than two barks, and tho&s;e unarmed.</P>
<P>The Gauls were the next people that incur|red the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Romans. Suppo&s;ing a time of peace, when the armies were di&s;band|ed, a proper &s;ea&s;on for new irruptions: this bar|barous people inviting fre&s;h forces from beyond the Alps, and entering Etruria, wa&s;ted all with fire and &s;word, till they came within about three days journey of Rome. A praetor and a con&s;ul were &s;ent to oppo&s;e them, who, now in|&s;tructed in the improved arts of war, were en|abled to &s;urround the Gauls, who &s;till retained their primaeval barbarity. It was in vain that tho&s;e hardy troops, who had nothing but their cou|rage to protect them, formed two fronts to op|po&s;e their adver&s;aries; their naked bodies and
<PB N="252" REF="263">
undi&s;ciplined forces were unable to with&s;tand the &s;hock of an enemy completely armed, and &s;killed in military evolutions. A mi&s;erable &s;laughter en&s;ued, in which forty thou&s;and were killed, and ten thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners. This victory was followed by another gained over them by Marcellus, in which he killed Virido|marus their king, with his own hand, and gained the third royal &s;poils that were yet ob|tained at Rome. The&s;e conque&s;ts forced them to beg a peace, the conditions of which &s;erved greatly to enlarge the empire. Thus the Ro|mans went on with &s;ucce&s;s; they had now to|tally recovered their former lo&s;&s;es, and only wanted an enemy worthy of their arms, to be|gin a new war.</P>
<P>An occa&s;ion &s;oon offered to renew their mi|litary aims. The Carthaginians, who only made a peace becau&s;e they were no longer able to continue the war, took the earlie&s;t opportunity of breaking the treaty: they be&s;ieged Sagun|tum, a city of Spain, which had been in alli|ance with Rome, and though de&s;ired to de&s;i&s;t, pro&s;ecuted their operations with vigour. Am|ba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent, in con&s;equence, from Rome to Carthage, complaining of the infraction of their articles, and requiring, that Hannibal the Carthaginian general, who had advi&s;ed this mea&s;ure, &s;hould be delivered up. This demand being refu&s;ed, the amba&s;&s;adors began to perceive
<PB N="253" REF="264">
their inclinations for a rupture, and holding out the &s;kirt of his robe, as was the cu&s;tom, told the Carthaginian mini&s;try, that he brought them peace or war, of which they might chu&s;e. They de&s;ired him to deliver which he thought pro|per; to which he returned, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then let it be war,"</Q> and thus leaving the a&s;&s;embly, returned to Rome.</P>
<P>War being thus again declared between the&s;e <MILESTONE N="536" UNIT="U. C."> great rival powers, the Carthaginians tru&s;ted the management of it, on their &s;ide, to Hannibal, the &s;on of Amilcar, their former general. Hannibal had been made the &s;worn foe of Rome, almo&s;t from his infancy; for while yet very young, his father brought him before the altar, and obliged him to take an oath, never to be in friend&s;hip with the Ro|mans, nor de&s;i&s;t from oppo&s;ing their power, until he or they &s;hould be no more. On his fir&s;t appearance in the field, he reconciled, in his own per&s;on, the mo&s;t ju&s;t method of com|manding, with the mo&s;t perfect obedience to his &s;uperiors. Thus he was equally beloved by his generals and the troops he was appointed to lead. He was po&s;&s;e&s;t of the greate&s;t courage in oppo&s;ing danger, and the greate&s;t pre&s;ence of mind in retiring from it. No fatigue was able to &s;ubdue his body, or break his &s;pirit: equally patient of heat and cold, he only took &s;u&s;te|nance to content nature, and not to delight his
<PB N="254" REF="265">
appetite. His &s;ea&s;ons for repo&s;e or labour were never marked, but he was ever ready when dif|ficulties, or his country demanded his aid. He was frequently found &s;tretched on the ground among his centinels, covered only with a watch|coat. His dre&s;s differed in nothing from the mo&s;t ordinary man of his army, except that he affected peculiar elegance in his hor&s;es and ar|mour. He was the be&s;t hor&s;eman, and the &s;wifte&s;t runner of his time. He was ever the foremo&s;t to engage, and the la&s;t to retreat; he was ever prudent in his de&s;igns, which were ex|ten&s;ive; and ever fertile in expedients to perplex his enemies, or to re&s;cue him&s;elf from hard&s;hips. He was experienced, &s;agacious, provident, and bold. Such were the admirable qualities of this inimitable &s;oldier, who is generally allowed the greate&s;t general of all antiquity; but on the other hand, he was cruel and faithle&s;s, without honour, without religion, and yet &s;o deceitful, as to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of them all: yet after all we mu&s;t remember, that it is his enemies who gave him this character. From &s;uch a &s;oldier and politician the Carthaginians formed the greate&s;t expectations, and his taking Saguntum &s;hortly after, confirmed them in their opinion of his abilities. But he &s;oon gave proofs of a much more exten&s;ive genius than they could have conceived; for, having over|run all Spain, and levied a large army of va|rious
<PB N="255" REF="266">
languages and nations, he re&s;olved to carry the war into Italy, as the Romans had be|fore carried it into the dominions of Carthage. For this purpo&s;e, leaving Hanno with a &s;uffi|cient force to guard his conque&s;ts in Spain, he cro&s;&s;ed the Pyrenean mountains into Gaul, with an army of fifty thou&s;and foot and nine thou|&s;and hor&s;e. He quickly traver&s;ed that country, which was then wild, exten&s;ive, and filled with inimical nations. In vain its fore&s;ts and rivers appeared to intimidate him; the Rhone with its rapid current, and its banks covered with enemies, or the Dura branched out into num|berle&s;s channels oppo&s;ed his way; he pa&s;&s;ed them all with per&s;everance, and in ten days arrived at the foot of the Alps, over which he was to explore a new pa&s;&s;age into Italy. It was now in the mid&s;t of winter, when this a&s;toni&s;hing project was un|dertaken; the &s;ea&s;on added new horrors to a &s;cene, that nature had already crowded with ob|jects of di&s;may. The prodigious height and tre|mendous &s;teepne&s;s of the mountains, capped with &s;now, the rude cottages that &s;eemed to hang upon the &s;ides of the precipices, the cattle, and even the wild bea&s;ts them&s;elves &s;tiff with cold, or de&s;perate with famine: the peo|ple barbarous and fierce, dre&s;&s;ed in &s;kins, with long &s;haggy hair, pre&s;ented a picture that im|pre&s;&s;ed the beholders with a&s;toni&s;hment and ter|ror. But nothing was capable of &s;ubduing the
<PB N="256" REF="267">
courage of the Carthaginian general; after hav|ing harrangued his army, he undertook to lead them up the &s;ides of the mountain, a&s;&s;uring his &s;oldiers, that they were now &s;caling, not the walls of Italy, but of Rome.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers in this march had not vain fears alone to combat with, but numberle&s;s and un|fore&s;een calamities. The inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold, the height of the precipices, the &s;moothne&s;s of the ice, but above all, the oppo&s;ition of the inhabitants, who a&s;&s;ailed them from above, and rolled down huge rocks upon them in their march, all contributed to di&s;pirit the army. At length, after nine days painful march through the&s;e untrodden paths, Hannibal gained the top of the mountains, where he rejoiced his &s;ol|diers, by &s;hewing them the charming and fer|tile vales of Italy, which were &s;tretched out be|neath. After two days re&s;pite, he next pre|pared to de&s;cend, and this was found a work of more danger, even than the former. Pro|digious quantities of &s;now having lately f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">llen, as many were &s;wallowed up in that, as had be|fore been de&s;troyed by the enemy. Every new advance &s;eemed but to encrea&s;e the danger&punc; till at la&s;t, he came to the verge of a preci|pice above three hundred yards perpendicular, which &s;eemed utterly unpa&s;&s;able. It was then that de&s;pair appeared in every face but Han|nibal's, but he &s;till remained un&s;haken: his fir&s;t
<PB N="257" REF="268">
effort was to endeavour by taking a circuit, to find a more commodious pa&s;&s;age, but finding this only encrea&s;e his difficulty, he re&s;olved to undertake levelling the rock. For this purpo&s;e, great numbers of large trees were felled, and a mighty pile made again&s;t it and &s;et on fire. The rock being thus heated, &s;ays Livy, was &s;oftened by vinegar, and a pa&s;&s;age opened through which the whole army might &s;afely pa&s;s. This &s;eemed to be the end of the diffi|culties of this march, for as he de&s;cended, the vallies between the mountains became more fertile, &s;o that the cattle found pa&s;ture, and the &s;oldiers had time to repo&s;e. Thus, at the end of fifteen days &s;pent in cro&s;&s;ing the Alps, Hannibal found him&s;elf in the plains of Italy, with about half his army remaining, the re&s;t having died, or being cut off in their march.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was known at Rome, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hannibal, at the head of an immen&s;e army. was cro&s;&s;ing the Alps, in order to invade their dominions, the &s;enate &s;ent Scipio to oppo&s;e him, as a general on whom they placed great dependence. Scipio being de&s;irous of making his principal effort, while Hannibal's army was not yet recovered from the fatigues of their march, brought up his forces, and attacked him near Ticinium. The engagement was for &s;ome time doubtful, but a party of Numidian hor&s;e wheeling round, attacked the Romans in
<PB N="258" REF="269">
the rear, and at la&s;t obliged them to retreat with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The con&s;ul was wound|ed in the beginning of the fight, and would have fallen into the hands of the enemy, had not his &s;on Scipio, afterwards called Africanus, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;nock of the engage|ment, and &s;aved his father's life, at the hazard of his own. Hannibal being thus victorious, took the mo&s;t prudent precautions to encrea&s;e his army, giving orders to Mago, his general of the cavalry, that when he ravaged the country round, always to &s;pare the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Gauls, while his depredations were permitted upon tho&s;e of Rome. This &s;o plea&s;ed that &s;imple people, that they declared for him in great numbers, and flocked to his &s;tandard with alacrity.</P>
<P>Soon after this defeat, Sempronius, the other con&s;ul, was re&s;olved to repair the injury &s;u&s;tain|ed by his colleague, and &s;eeing the continual defection of the Gauls, going off to encrea&s;e the &s;trength of the Punic army, he determined to give battle the fir&s;t opportunity. Hannibal was not long in delaying his expectations, and both armies met upon the banks of the river Trebia. The Carthaginian general being ap|prized of the Roman impetuo&s;ity, of which be always availed him&s;elf in almo&s;t every engage|ment, had &s;ent off a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, each with a foot-&s;oldier behind him, acro&s;s the ri|ver,
<PB N="259" REF="270">
to ravage the enemies country, and pro|voke them to engage. The Romans quickly routed this force, who &s;eeming to be defeated, took the river, and were as eagerly pur&s;ued by the con&s;ul. It was not however, till his army was got upon the oppo&s;ite bank, that he per|ceived him&s;elf half conquered already, his men being fatigued by wading up to the armpits, and quite benumbed by the inten&s;e coldne&s;s of the water. But it was now too late to retire, for Hannibal came pouring down his forces, fre&s;h and vigorous, &s;o that the battle &s;oon be|came general. The courage of the Romans for a while with&s;tood every di&s;advantage, and kept the victory doubtful, but they &s;oon found them|&s;elves attacked al&s;o in the rear by a party of hor&s;e, which the Carthaginian general had laid in ambu&s;h, to be ready on this occa&s;ion. At length, a total rout en&s;ued; twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and of the Romans were either killed by the enemy or drowned in attempting to repa&s;s the river. A body of ten thou&s;and men were all that &s;urviv|ed, who finding them&s;elves enclo&s;ed on every &s;ide, broke de&s;perately through the enemies ranks, and fought retreating, till they found &s;helter in the city of Placentia.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the&s;e two battles only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the caution of Hannibal and the vigi|lance of Rome. Preparations for the en&s;uing campaign were carried on with greater vigour
<PB N="260" REF="271">
than before, and the Carthaginian general finding him&s;elf in a condition to change the feat of the war, re&s;olved to approach Rome, by marching into Etruria. There were two ways for effecting his march thither; one, more tedious, but &s;ecure; the other, which was &s;horter, led through the mar&s;hes, cau&s;ed by the overflowing of the river Arno. All the former fatigues of the Carthaginian army were nothing, compared to their &s;uffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> here. They were forced to march three days and nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, up to the knees in water, without &s;leep or without re&s;t; the hoofs of the hor&s;es came off in their pa&s;&s;age, while the bea&s;ts of burthen that carried the baggage, unable to &s;upport the fatigue, were left dead in the mud. Hannibal him&s;elf riding upon an elephant, which was the only one left alive, felt all the compli|cated di&s;tre&s;s of his own &s;ituation, and that of his army. His health had been impaired in the preceding &s;pring, and having then an inflamma|tion in his eyes, he, by his pre&s;ent fatigues, lo&s;t one of them entirely. At la&s;t however, he ar|rived upon dry ground, where he was informed, that Flamminius the con&s;ul was encamped near Aricia, waiting the arrival of the other con&s;ul with reinforcements from Rome. One of Han|nibal's chief excellencies in war, was the care he took to inform him&s;elf of the temper and di&s;po|&s;ition of the generals who oppo&s;ed him, and find|ing that Flamminius was ra&s;h and overbearing,
<PB N="261" REF="272">
&s;woln with his former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and confident of the future, he re&s;olved to bring him to an engagement before his colleague could come up. Seeming therefore to take no notice of his army, that lay in the direct road towards Rome, he left it on one &s;ide, and marching onward, as if to be&s;iege the capital it&s;elf, he ravaged the whole country round in a terrible manner, with fire and &s;word. Flamminius, as was expected, could not tamely bear to &s;ee an in&s;ulting enemy lay|ing every thing wa&s;te before him, but burned for the engagement. It was in vain, that he was advi&s;ed by the Senate, and all about him, to u&s;e caution, and not to let the enemies in&s;ults provoke him to an unequal combat. He im|mediately ordered his troops to march, his friends foreboding their future danger, while the &s;oldiers went rejoicing in the courage of their general, and indulging their hopes, rather than con&s;idering the rea&s;ons they had for hoping. Hannibal was with his army, at the time when Flamminius came out to engage him, at the lake of Thra&s;imene, near to which was a chain of mountains, and between the&s;e and the lake, a narrow pa&s;&s;age leading to a valley that was embo&s;omed in hills. It was upon the&s;e hills that he di&s;po&s;ed his be&s;t troops, and it was into this valley that Flamminius led his men to attack him. A di&s;po&s;ition every way &s;o favourable for the Carthaginians, was al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="262" REF="273">
accident, for a mi&s;t ri&s;ing from the lake, kept the Romans from &s;eeing their enemies, while the army upon the mountains, being above its influence, &s;aw the whole di&s;po&s;ition of their op|ponents. The fortune of the day was &s;uch as might be expected from the conduct of the two generals; the Roman army was broken, and &s;laughtered, almo&s;t before they could per|ceive the enemy that de&s;troyed them. About fifteen thou&s;and Romans fell in the valley, and &s;ix thou&s;and more were obliged to yield them|&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. In this general car|nage, the unfortunate Flamminius did all that courage could in&s;pire, to &s;ave his army; where|ever the enemy was mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, he flew with a cho&s;en body of his attendants to repre&s;s them; at la&s;t, de&s;pairing of victory, and un|willing to &s;urvive a defeat, he flung him&s;elf alone into the mid&s;t of the enemy, and was killed by a Gauli&s;h hor&s;eman, who &s;truck him through the body with a blow of his lance. Hannibal, after the battle, kept the Roman pri&s;oners, but civilly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of the La|tins, and willing to give the con&s;ul an honour|able interment, he &s;ought his body among&s;t the heaps of &s;lain, but it could not be found.</P>
<P>Upon the news of this defeat at Rome, after the general con&s;ternation was allayed, the &s;enate, upon mature deliberation, re&s;olved to elect a com|mander with ab&s;olute authority, in whom they
<PB N="263" REF="274">
might repo&s;e their la&s;t and greate&s;t expectations. Their choice fell upon Fabius Maximus, a man of great courage, but with a happy mixture of caution; le&s;s enraptured with the glare of victory, than the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erv|ing it. This old commander, thus inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme dignity, &s;et forward with what preparations he was able to make, but with no intentions of fighting an enemy, whom he knew more powerful than him&s;elf. He had long before &s;etting out laid a plan by which to proceed, and to that he &s;trictly adhered during all the en&s;uing campaigns. He was apprized that the only way to humble the Carthaginians at &s;uch a di&s;tance from home, was rather by har|ra&s;&s;ing them than by fighting. For this purpo&s;e, he always encamped upon the highe&s;t grounds, inacce&s;&s;ible to the enemies cavalry. Whenever they moved he moved, watched their motions &s;traightened their quarters, and cut off their provi&s;ions. It was in vain that Hannibal u&s;ed every &s;tratagem to bring him to a battle; the cautious Roman, thence &s;urnamed Cunctator, &s;till kept aloof, contented with &s;eeing his enemy in &s;ome mea&s;ure defeated by delay. Hanni|bal, now therefore, perceiving that his adver|&s;aries had altered their plan of operations, tried his u&s;ual arts to make Fabius appear de&s;picable to his own army. He &s;ometimes therefore, braved him in his camp, he &s;ometimes wa&s;ted
<PB N="264" REF="275">
the country round him, talked of his abilities with contempt, and in all his excur&s;ions, &s;pared the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Fabius, while tho&s;e of the other Romans were plundered without mercy. The&s;e arts in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded: the Ro|mans began to &s;u&s;pect their general, either of cowardice or treachery, and a &s;light action that en&s;ued a little after, gave &s;trength to their &s;u&s;|picions. For Hannibal de&s;igning to march, for the convenience of forage, to a place called Ca&s;&s;inum, he was, by a mi&s;take of his guide, conducted towards Ca&s;&s;ilinum, where he found him&s;elf in a clo&s;e country, hemmed in on every &s;ide. However, willing to draw all the advan|tages he was able from his &s;ituation, he ordered his cavalry to pillage the country round, which the Roman army, that &s;till kept him in view, beheld from a neighbouring hill. Hannibal knew that his depredations would excite them to a de&s;ire of revenge; but it was in vain they cried out to their phlegmatic general, to lead them down upon the enemy. Fabius &s;till kept his po&s;t, contrary to all the entreaties of his men, and even the expo&s;tulations of Minutius, his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. It was now therefore found, that the prudent Roman began to prac|ti&s;e Hannibal's own &s;tratagems again&s;t him&s;elf: he had now enclo&s;ed him among mountains, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to winter, and yet, from which, it was almo&s;t impracticable to extricate
<PB N="265" REF="276">
his army without imminent danger. In this ex|igence, nothing but one of tho&s;e &s;tratagems of war, which fall to the lot of great abilities only to invent, could &s;ave him. Hannibal's amazing fertility in expedients, &s;ugge&s;ted one at this time which was &s;ucce&s;sful: he ordered a num|ber of &s;mall faggots and lighted torches to be tied to the horns of two thou&s;and oxen, that he had in his camp, and that they &s;hould be driven towards the enemy. The&s;e to&s;&s;ing their heads, and running up the &s;ides of the mountains, &s;eemed to fill the whole neighbour|ing fore&s;t with fire, while the centinels that were placed to guard the approaches of the mountain, &s;eeing &s;uch a number of flames ad|vancing towards their po&s;ts, fled in con&s;terna|tion, &s;uppo&s;ing the whole body of the enemy was in arms to overwhelm them. By this &s;tra|tagem, Hannibal drew off his army, and e&s;cap|ed through the defiles that led beneath the hills, though with con&s;iderable damage to his rear. Although Fabius had conducted him&s;elf in this expedition with all the prudence and conduct of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate general, he could not prevent the murmurs of his army, who now began to tax his ignorance in war, as they had formerly impeached his valour and fidelity.</P>
<P>Fabius, no way &s;ollicitous to quiet the mur|murs, either of his army or of the citizens them|&s;elves, returned to Rome, in order to rai&s;e mo|ney
<PB N="266" REF="277">
to ran&s;om &s;ome Roman pri&s;oners, whom Hannibal offered to relea&s;e: but in the mean time, he gave his in&s;tructions to Minucius, his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, to ab&s;tain from giving the enemy battle, upon any occa&s;ion what&s;oever. Minucius however, who now began to have the &s;ame opinion of the dictator, that the re&s;t of the &s;oldiers entertained of him, little regarded his in&s;tructions, but venturing out again&s;t the Carthaginians, &s;kirmi&s;hed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that by univer&s;al con&s;ent, was made equal in power to the dictator, and both generals were appointed to command, each his own part of the army. Being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of equal power, Minucius began by altering the former con|duct of Fabius. From keeping on the tops of the mountains, he now drew down his part of the army into the plain, and offered the enemy battle. This was the di&s;po&s;ition that Hannibal had long wi&s;hed for, and pre|tending to be very earne&s;t in taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of an hill which commanded the camp of the Romans, he drew the eyes of all to that quarter, while he formed an ambu&s;cade on the other &s;ide, with orders to &s;ally forth in the mid&s;t of the engagement. The Romans ac|cordingly made mo&s;t a vigorous attack upon the Carthaginians, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill, while new reinforcements were &s;ent from either army. At la&s;t, Minucius drew out his
<PB N="267" REF="278">
legions, and the engagement became general. It was then that the &s;uperior conduct of the Carthaginian commander was di&s;covered, for the men who were placed in ambu&s;h &s;allying forth upon the rear, began to throw the whole Roman army into confu&s;ion, and nothing le&s;s than a total defeat threatened to en&s;ue. In the mean time, Fabius, who was returned from Rome, after &s;olliciting an exchange of pri&s;on|ers, and after &s;elling all his little patrimony, to rai&s;e a &s;um which he was denied by the &s;enate, to pay their ran&s;om, came in while Mi|nucius was in this de&s;perate &s;ituation. He did not long he&s;itate upon the cour&s;e he &s;hould pur&s;ue, but falling upon the Carthaginians, at once &s;topt the flight of the Romans, and ob|&s;tructed the enemies pur&s;uit. Hannibal now perceived, that the cloud which had &s;o long hovered upon the mountains, at la&s;t broke upon him in a &s;torm; he was obliged to command a retreat, while Minucius was &s;o convinced of his former ra&s;hne&s;s, that he confe&s;&s;ed his error to Fabius, whom he now called his father, and renouncing his new power, again &s;ubjected his office freely to the dictator&s;hip.</P>
<P>Soon after however, Fabius was obliged to lay down his office, his time being expired, and a violent conte&s;t en&s;ued at Rome, about the proper per&s;ons to be elected to the con&s;ul&s;hip. The patricians and the plebeians, as u&s;ual, taking
<PB N="268" REF="279">
oppo&s;ite &s;ides, at la&s;t the multitude prevailed, and Terentius Varro was cho&s;en alone, by the majority of voices in the a&s;&s;embly of the people. This Te|rentius Varro was a man &s;prung from the dregs of the people, and with nothing but his confidence and riches to recommend him. He had long a&s;|pired at the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate: being ignorant, vain, boa&s;tful, and confident, but fond of popular applau&s;e, and &s;eeking it by all the arts of meanne&s;s and adulation. With him was joined Aemilius Paulus, of a di&s;po&s;ition entirely oppo&s;ite; experienced in the field, cau|tious in action, and impre&s;&s;ed with a thorough contempt of the abilities of his plebeian col|league. Fabius, who had ju&s;t re&s;igned his of|fice, &s;aw, with his u&s;ual &s;agacity, the danger that threatened the &s;tate, from two &s;uch ill|matched commanders, and entreated Aemilius, by all he held dear, to guard again&s;t the de|vices of Hannibal, and the ra&s;hne&s;s of Teren|tius Varro. However, it was now no time for indulging fearful apprehen&s;ions, the enemy be|ing at hand, and the Romans finding them|&s;elves enabled to bring a competent force into the field, being almo&s;t ninety thou&s;and &s;trong.</P>
<P>Hannibal was at this time encamped near the village of Cannae, with a wind that for a certain &s;ea&s;on blows &s;till one way, in his rear, which rai&s;ing great clouds of du&s;t from the parched plains behind, he knew mu&s;t greatly
<PB N="269" REF="280">
di&s;tre&s;s an approaching enemy. In this &s;itua|tion he waited the coming up of the Romans, with an army of forty thou&s;and foot and half that number of cavalry. The two con&s;uls &s;oon appeared, to his wi&s;h, dividing their forces into two parts, and agreeing to take the command every day by turns. On the fir&s;t day of their arrival, it falling to the lot of Aemilius to command, he was entirely aver&s;e to engaging, and though Hannibal did all that lay in his power, by in&s;ulting his men in their camp, and his colleague, by reproaching his timidity, to bring him to a battle, yet he ob&s;tinately de|clined fighting, con&s;cious of the enemy's &s;upe|rior di&s;po&s;ition. The next day however, it be|ing come to Varro's turn to command, he, without a&s;king his colleague's concurrence, gave the &s;ignal for battle, and pa&s;&s;ing the river Aufidus, that lay between both armies, put his forces in array. The two con&s;uls com|manded the two wings, Varro on the right, and Aemilius on the left; to him al&s;o was con|&s;igned the general conduct of the engagement. On the other hand, Hannibal, who had been from day-break employed in the field mar&s;hal|ling his forces as they came up, and in&s;piring them with courage by his voice and example, had &s;o artfully di&s;po&s;ed them, that both the wind and the &s;un were in his favour. His cavalry were ordered to oppo&s;e tho&s;e of
<PB N="270" REF="281">
Rome. His heavy armed African infantry were placed in either wing. The&s;e, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, might have been mi&s;taken for a Roman army them&s;elves, being dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;poils of &s;uch as were killed at Trebia and Thra&s;ymene. Next the&s;e were the Gauls, a fierce people, naked from the wai&s;t, bearing large round &s;hields, and &s;words of an enormous &s;ize, blunt|ed at the point. The Spaniards were placed in the centre, brandi&s;hing &s;hort pointed daggers, and dre&s;t in linnen ve&s;ts, embroidered with the brighte&s;t &s;carlet. A&s;drubal commanded the left wing, the right was given to Maherbal, and Hannibal him&s;elf fought on foot in the centre of the army. The battle began with the light|armed infantry; the hor&s;e engaged &s;oon after, and the Roman cavalry being unable to &s;tand again&s;t tho&s;e of Numidia, the legions came up to reinforce them. It was then that the conflict became general; the Roman &s;oldiers, for a long time, endeavoured, but in vain, to pene|trate the centre where the Gauls and Spaniards fought; which Hannibal ob&s;erving, ordered part of tho&s;e troops to give way, and to per|mit the Romans to embo&s;om them&s;elves within a cho&s;en body of his Africans, whom he had placed on either wing, &s;o as to &s;urround them: upon that a terrible &s;laughter began to en&s;ue of the Romans, fatigued by their repeated at|tacks, by the Africans, who were fre&s;h and vi|gorous.
<PB N="271" REF="282">
All the hopes of Rome now lay in the cavalry of the allies, which yet continued un|broken, but even on that &s;ide the great art of Han|nibal di&s;covered it&s;elf: for having ordered five hundred of his Numidian hor&s;e, who had dag|gers concealed under their coats of mail, to go again&s;t the enemy, and to make a &s;hew of &s;ur|rendering them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; the&s;e obeying, and being placed by the allied caval|ry for greater &s;ecurity, in the rear, while they were employed in combating the troops that oppo&s;ed them in front, all of a &s;udden, the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed pri&s;oners fell upon them with their daggers, from behind, and put them into irre|coverable confu&s;ion. Thus the rout at la&s;t be|came general in every part of the Roman army; the boa&s;tings of Varro were now no longer heard, while Aemilius, who had been terribly wounded by a &s;linger in the very beginning of the en|gagement, &s;till feebly led on his body of hor&s;e, and did all that could be done to make head again&s;t the enemy; however, being unable to &s;it on hor&s;e|back, he was forced to di&s;mount, as did al&s;o tho&s;e who followed him; but what could be expected from a mea&s;ure dictated only by de&s;pair! Tho' they fought with great intrepidity for &s;ome time, they were at la&s;t obliged to give way, tho&s;e that were able, remounting their hor&s;es, and &s;eeking &s;afety by flight. It was in this de|plorable condition of things, that one Lentulus,
<PB N="272" REF="283">
a tribune of the army, as he was flying on hor&s;e|back from the enemy, which at &s;ome di&s;tance pur&s;ued him, met the con&s;ul Aemilius &s;itting upon a &s;tone, covered over with blood and wounds, and waiting for the coming up of the pur&s;uers. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Aemilius," cried the generous tri|bune, "you, at lea&s;t, are guiltle&s;s of this day's &s;laughter: take my hor&s;e, while you have any &s;trength remaining, I will engage to a&s;|&s;i&s;t, and will with my life defend you. We have already lo&s;t blood enough in the field, do not make the day more dreadful by the lo&s;s of a commander." "I thank thee, Lentulus," cried the dying con&s;ul, "for ever guard thy virtue, and may the gods re|compence thy piety; but as for me, all is over, my part is cho&s;en; do not therefore, by attempting to per&s;uade a de&s;perate man, lo&s;e the only means of procuring thine own &s;afety. Go, I command thee, and tell the &s;enate, from me, to fortify Rome again&s;t the approach of the conqueror. Tell Fabius al&s;o, that Aemilius, while living, ever re|membered his advice, and now dying, ap|proves it."</Q> While he was yet &s;peaking, the enemy approached, and Lentulus, before he was out of view, &s;aw the con&s;ul expire, feebly fighting in the mid&s;t of them. The &s;laughter had now con|tinued for &s;everal hours, till at la&s;t, the conquer|ors, quite wearied with de&s;troying, Hannibal gave
<PB N="273" REF="284">
orders for them to de&s;i&s;t, and led them back to encampment, a large body of Romans having previou&s;ly &s;urrendered upon condition of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without arms. In this battle, the Romans lo&s;t fifty thou&s;and men, two Quae&s;tors, twenty one Tribunes, eighty &s;enators, and &s;o many knights, that it is &s;aid, Hannibal &s;ent three bu&s;hels of gold rings to Carthage, which tho&s;e of this order had worn on their fingers.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed the deci&s;ive blow, that was to determine the fate of Rome: it only now re|mained, and was univer&s;ally expected, that Hannibal &s;hould march his army to the gates of the city, and make it an ea&s;y conque&s;t. This was the advice of Maherbal, his captain of the hor&s;e, who, when Hannibal rejected it, could not help ob&s;erving, that the Car|thaginian general was much more &s;killful in gaining victories, than in improving them. In|deed the ju&s;tice of Maherbal's advice &s;eems to appear from the general terror that univer&s;ally prevailed in Rome at that time. Nothing was heard throughout the city but &s;hrieks and lamen|tations of women, who on every &s;ide demanded their hu&s;bands or their children. In vain, for a time, could the &s;enators con&s;ult together, being di&s;turbed by the cries of the populace. No|thing but terror appeared in every face, and de&s;pair was the language of every tongue. At
<PB N="274" REF="285">
length, when the fir&s;t con&s;ternation was abated, the &s;enate came to a general re&s;olution, to cre|ate a dictator, in order to give &s;trength to their government. Orders were al&s;o given, to keep all women from coming abroad, and &s;preading the con&s;ternation; &s;trict guards were placed at the city gates, with &s;trict injunctions, that none &s;hould leave the city. It was at this time, that young Scipio, whom we have already &s;een &s;av|ing his father's life in battle, was now re&s;olved to &s;ave his country al&s;o. He was then but a tribune of the army, and being retired the night after the battle, to a little town in the neighbourhood of Rome, was informed, that &s;ome young men of the fir&s;t families in the city were at a certain hou&s;e preparing to aban|don their country, and re&s;olving to &s;eek for &s;afety el&s;ewhere. He was in&s;tantly filled with indignation at their pu&s;ilanimity; he therefore re&s;olved to prevent that influence which their example might have upon others, and turning to &s;ome of his fellow &s;oldiers who were with him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let tho&s;e, cried he, to whom Rome is dear, follow me."</Q> So &s;aying, he went di|rectly to the hou&s;e in que&s;tion, where he found them in actual deliberation. Upon this, laying his hand upon his &s;word, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;wear, cried he, that I will never abandon Rome, and will never &s;uffer that others &s;hould abandon it. Tho&s;e who will not take the &s;ame oath, are
<PB N="275" REF="286">
not only their country's enemies, but mine"</Q> The re&s;olute manner in which he &s;poke this, together with his known courage, in &s;ome mea&s;ure intimidated the con&s;pirators, they all took the &s;ame oath, and vowed, rather than for&s;ake Rome&punc; to &s;tay till they were buried be|neath its ruins. Thence forward, the people &s;eemed to gather new re&s;olution; the &s;enate cenceived new hopes of victory, and the augurs gave them a&s;&s;urance of a turn in their favour. A &s;hort time after, Varro arrived near Rome; having left behind him wretched remains of his army; he had been the principal cau&s;e of the late calamity, and it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;enate would &s;everely reprimand the ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct. But fat otherwi&s;e! The Romans went out in multitudes to meet him, and the &s;enate returned him thanks, that he had not de&s;paired of the &s;afety of Rome. Such a conque&s;t over all the vindictive pa&s;&s;ions, was much greater than the victory at Cannae. The people being thus, by Hannibal's delay, in&s;pir|ed with fre&s;h courage, made all po&s;&s;ible prepa|rations for another campaign. They armed their &s;laves, and filled up the &s;enate, which wanted near half its number. Fabius, who was con&s;idered as the &s;hield of Rome, and Marcel|lus as the &s;word, were appointed to lead the armies, and though Hannibal once more offered them peace, they refu&s;ed it, but upon condi|tion
<PB N="276" REF="287">
that he &s;hould quit Italy, terms &s;imilar to tho&s;e they had in&s;i&s;ted upon from Pyrrhus before.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Hannibal, either finding the impo&s;&s;ibility of marching directly to Rome, or willing to give his forces re&s;t after &s;uch a mighty victory, led them to Capua, where he re&s;olved to winter. This city had long been con&s;idered as the nur&s;e of luxury and the cor|rupter of all military virtue; here therefore, a new &s;cene of plea&s;ure opened to his barbarian troops, and they at once gave them&s;elves up to the intoxication, till, from being hardy veterans, they became infirm rioters. For this he has been greatly blamed by antiquity, as lo&s;ing that happy occa&s;ion, when fortune &s;eems kind, and exchanging empire for di&s;&s;ipation; but it is not con&s;idered what numberle&s;s ob&s;tacles he had to &s;urmount, and what an enemy he had to deal with. Rome was as yet powerful, it could bring into the field, if we may judge from the late&s;t e&s;timate that was made of its numbers, two hundred thou&s;and fighting men; it might therefore, have been ra&s;hne&s;s it&s;elf in Hannibal, to lead his army to the &s;iege of a city, &s;trongly defended by art, and with a garri&s;on more than four times his equal. We have only to give him credit upon this occa&s;ion, for what he would have done, by remembering the &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ibilities which he happily at|chieved. To have led and maintained a large
<PB N="277" REF="288">
army, con&s;i&s;ting of various nations, more than a thou&s;and miles from home. To have &s;ur|mounted precipices, which, con&s;idering the place he entered Italy, are, to this day, re|garded as impa&s;&s;able. To have fought &s;ucce&s;s|fully, for many years, in the heart of an ene|mies country. To have, by his &s;ingle pre&s;ence, united into obedience, and formed into one body an army, compo&s;ed of Spaniards, Afri|cans, Gauls, and Ligurians, and kept them &s;teady to him, though often wanting bread. To have an ob&s;tinate enemy to combat, and faith|le&s;s employers at home, who retarded, becau&s;e they envied his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. When we con&s;ider him as triumphing over all the&s;e ob&s;tacles by the &s;trength of his own genius only, we view in him the mo&s;t augu&s;t &s;pectacle, that all anti|quity has ever exhibited.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have found this great man &s;uc|ce&s;sful, but now we are to rever&s;e the picture, and &s;urvey him &s;truggling with accumulated misfortunes, and at la&s;t, &s;inking beneath them. His fir&s;t repul&s;e was from his own countrymen at home. Whil&s;t, at Rome, the thanks of the &s;enate were voted to a con&s;ul who fled, at Car|thage, Hanno, one of their former generals, began to form a party again&s;t Hannibal, and more an enemy to his rival, than to the Romans them&s;elves, forgot nothing that might ob&s;truct
<PB N="278" REF="289">
the &s;ucce&s;&s;es he had in pro&s;pect, or tarni&s;h the &s;plendor of tho&s;e he had already obtained. Upon Hannibal's &s;ending for a new &s;upply of men and money to the &s;enate of Carthage, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What would this man have a&s;ked," cried Han|no," "if he had lo&s;t a battle? when he makes &s;uch draughts upon us after gaining a victo|ry. No, no, he is either an impo&s;tor, that amu&s;es us with fal&s;e news, or a public rob|ber, that enriches him&s;elf and not his coun|try."</Q> This oppo&s;ition, the effects of which &s;till continued to operate, delayed the nece&s;&s;ary &s;uccours, though it could not hinder their tardy compliance. Thus, being frequently de&s;titute of money and provi&s;ions, and reduced to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being always &s;ucce&s;sful, with no re|cruits of &s;trength in ca&s;e of ill fortune, and no encouragement even in the good, it is not to be wondered at, that his affairs began at length to decline, and that tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ing ge|nerals began to pro&s;per, who&s;e employers ob|&s;erved a contrary conduct.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t lo&s;s was at the &s;iege of Nola, where Marcellus the praetor made a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ally. He &s;ome time after attempted to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Capua, and attacked the Romans in their trenches, but he was repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. He then made a feint of going to be&s;iege Rome, but finding a &s;uperior army ready to
<PB N="279" REF="290">
receive him, he was obliged to retire. For &s;ome years after, he fought with various &s;ucce&s;s, Mar|cellus, <MILESTONE N="544" UNIT="U. C."> his opponent, &s;ometimes gaining, and &s;ometimes lo&s;ing the advantage, but coming to no deci&s;ive engagement. However, even victo|ries them&s;elves could not re&s;tore the affairs of Hannibal, for though the&s;e might le&s;&s;en the number of his enemies forces, he had exhau&s;ted all the arts of recruiting his own.</P>
<P>The &s;enate of Carthage, at length, came to a re&s;olution of &s;ending his brother A&s;drubal to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with a body of forces drawn out of Spain. A&s;drubal's march being made known to the con&s;uls, Livius and Nero, they went again&s;t him with great expedition, and &s;urround|ed him in a place, into which he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the treachery of his guides, and cut his whole army to pieces. Hannibal had long expected the&s;e &s;uc|cours with impatience, and the very night, on which he had been a&s;&s;ured of his brother's arri|val, Nero ordered A&s;drubal's head to be cut off, and thrown into his camp. He now therefore, began to perceive the approaches of the downfal of Carthage, and could not help, with a &s;igh, ob&s;erving to tho&s;e about him, that fortune &s;eemed fatigued with granting favours.</P>
<P>But it was not in Italy alone, that the affairs of Carthage &s;eemed to decline, for the Romans, while yet bleeding from their defeat at Cannae,
<PB N="280" REF="291">
&s;ent legions into Spain, Sardinia, and Sicily. This unconquerable people, &s;urrounded by ene|mies on every &s;ide, &s;till found re&s;ources to op|po&s;e them all; they not only fought tho&s;e na|tions, but appointed fre&s;h &s;uccours to the few allies that yet adhered to them: they made head again&s;t Hannibal in Italy, and &s;till more, un|dertook a new war again&s;t Philip, king of Ma|cedon, for having made a league with the Car|thaginians. Fortune &s;eemed to favour them in almo&s;t all their enterprizes. Laevinus, the con&s;ul gained con&s;iderable advantages over Philip, and Marcellus took Syracu&s;e in Sicily, which was defended by the machines and fires of Archi|medes the mathematician.</P>
<P>This great city fir&s;t invited the efforts of the be&s;iegers, as it was generally thought indefen|&s;ible, and its riches were immen&s;e. The Ro|mans therefore &s;ate down before it, with the expectation of a &s;peedy &s;urrender, and immen&s;e plunder. But the wi&s;dom of one man alone, &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pend its fate: this was Archime|des, the celebrated mathematician, many of who&s;e works are &s;till remaining; he de&s;troy|ing their men, and demoli&s;hing their &s;hipping. He &s;o united the powers of mechani&s;m, that he rai&s;ed their ve&s;&s;els into the air, and then let them da&s;h to pieces, by the violence of their fall. He al&s;o made u&s;e of burning gla&s;&s;es, which, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome hundred yards,

&s;et the Roman &s;hips and wooden towers on fire. At la&s;t however, the town was taken on a great fe&s;tival by &s;urprize. The inhabitants were put to the &s;word, and among the re&s;t, Archimedes, who was found meditating in his &s;tudy, was &s;lain by a Roman &s;oldier. Marcellus, the ge|neral, was not a little grieved at his death; a pa&s;&s;ion for letters, at that time, began to pre|vail among the higher ranks of people at Rome. He therefore ordered his body to be honourably buried, and a tomb to be erected to his memory, which however his works have long &s;urvived.</P>
<P>As for their fortunes in Spain, though for a while they appeared doubtful, two of the Sci|pios being &s;lain, and Claudius Nero, the go|vernor of the province, much an under-match for the cunning of the Carthaginian general; yet they &s;oon recovered their complexion under the conduct of Scipio Africanus, who &s;ued for the office of procon&s;ul, for that kingdom, at a time when every one el&s;e was willing to decline it. Scipio, who was now but twenty-four years old, had all the qualifications requi&s;ite for form|ing a great general, and a good man: he united the greate&s;t courage with the greate&s;t tender|ne&s;s; &s;uperior to Hannibal in the arts of peace, and almo&s;t his equal in tho&s;e of war. His fa|ther had been killed in Spain, &s;o that he &s;eemed to have an hereditary claim to the conque&s;t of the country. He therefore appeared irre&s;i&s;tible,
<PB N="282" REF="293">
obtaining many great victories, yet &s;ubduing &s;till more by his genero&s;ity, mildne&s;s, and be|nevolent di&s;po&s;ition, than by the force of his arms. Among other in&s;tances of the greatne&s;s of Scipio's mind, was the following: upon the taking of New Carthage, he treated his pri|&s;oners with the utmo&s;t lenity, and different from other generals, who permitted every barba|rity to their &s;oldiers, he repre&s;&s;ed his men from doing any injury to &s;uch as &s;ued for mercy. Among the pri&s;oners that were made at the taking this city, a young prince&s;s was brought before him, of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite beauty: &s;he had been promi&s;ed to Alleucius, a prince of that country, who loved her with the mo&s;t ar|dent pa&s;&s;ion, and had felt the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s for her captivity. It was thought, by the &s;ollicitude the generous Roman &s;eemed to &s;hew, that he de&s;igned a&s;king her from her parents for him&s;elf, and more &s;o, when he de|&s;ired, that the prince and they might come before him. The young prince approached, trembling with anxiety, expecting to hear, that his mi&s;|tre&s;s, who was now the property of another, was intended to promote the happine&s;s of her con|queror: but his fears were di&s;pelled, when Scipio giving the prince&s;s to his arms, bade him take what was his by a prior claim, and only de&s;ired his friend&s;hip and alliance in return: at the &s;ame time, he refu&s;ed the ran&s;om which her parents
<PB N="283" REF="294">
had brought, and when they pre&s;&s;ed him to take it, he de&s;ired it might be added to her portion. It was by &s;uch generous acts as the&s;e, as well as the fortune of his arms, that he re|duced the whole country to the obedience of the empire.</P>
<P>In this manner, Spain and Sicily being added to the Roman empire, it now found re&s;our|ces for continuing the Punic war. However, Hannibal &s;till kept his ground in Italy, al|though he was un&s;upported at home, and but indifferently a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the alliances he had made, &s;ince his cro&s;&s;ing the Alps. He had now continued in this country for more than fourteen years, and as Polybius &s;ays, had never lo&s;t a &s;in|gle battle, where he him&s;elf was the commader. But it was now too late to retrieve his fortune, the Romans were taught his own arts, his old army was worn out, either with exce&s;&s;es of fatigue or debauchery; his countrymen had given over &s;ending new &s;upplies, &s;o that he had nothing now to make him formidable, but the fame of his former good fortune.</P>
<P>It was in this po&s;ture of his affairs, that Scipio returned with an army from the conque&s;t of Spain, and was made con&s;ul at the age of twenty-nine. It was at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, he in|tended meeting Hannibal in Italy, and that he would attempt driving him from thence; but he had already formed a wi&s;er plan, which was

to carry the war into Africa, and while the Carthaginians kept an army near Rome, to make them tremble for their own capital. This mea&s;ure was oppo&s;ed with great heat by Fa|bius, and thereupon a con&s;iderable difference aro&s;e; but at la&s;t it was determined by the &s;enate, that Scipio &s;hould be granted Sicily for his province, and that leave &s;hould be given him to pa&s;s over into Africa, if he &s;aw it convenient for the intere&s;ts of Rome. This he con&s;idered as a concurrence with his aims; he accordingly &s;pent the fir&s;t year in Sicily, providing nece&s;&s;aries for his intended expedi|tion, and went over into Africa the beginning of the next, with a large fleet, where he was joined by Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, the depo&s;ed king of Nu|midia, with whom he had made an alliance in Spain.</P>
<P>Scipio was not long in Africa without em|ployment, for in a &s;hort time, Hanno oppo&s;ed him, who was defeated and &s;lain. Syphax, the u&s;urper of Numidia, led up a large army again&s;t him. The Roman general, for a time, declined fighting, till finding an opportunity, he &s;et fire to the enemy's tents, and attacking him in the mid&s;t of the confu&s;ion, killed forty thou|&s;and of his men, and took &s;ix thou&s;and pri&s;oners. Not long after, Syphax, willing to &s;trike one blow more for empire, and fearing that his kingdom would return to the true po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, in ca&s;e the the Romans &s;hould &s;ucceed, gathered together a
<PB N="285" REF="296">
numerous army of various nations, and with the&s;e unexperienced troops marched again&s;t Scipio. His former ill fortune followed him, he was &s;oon defeated, and he him&s;elf taken pri|&s;oner. Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a being thus put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the u&s;urper's per&s;on, the better to regain his king|dom, marched with the utmo&s;t expedition to Cirta, the chief city, and &s;hewing Syphax in bonds, procured the gates to be opened, every one &s;triving to make up their former di&s;loyalty, by their ready obedience. In this manner, Ma&s;|&s;ini&s;&s;a became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the royal palace, and and all the wealth of the late king, but among the re&s;t, of a trea&s;ure that he e&s;teemed above all, Sophoni&s;ba, the wife of Syphax. Sophoni&s;ba was the daughter of A&s;drubal, one of the Car|thaginian generals: &s;he was a woman of great ambition, and incomparable beauty: it was &s;he, that from the beginning had incited Sy|phax to declare again&s;t Rome, in favour of Carthage, and the influence of her charms was &s;uch, that he gave up &s;afety, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of love. Upon Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a's entering the palace, he was met by the queen, who with all the allurements of weeping beauty, fell at his feet, and entreated him to &s;pare her youth, and not deliver her up to the Romans, who were pre|pared to take revenge upon her, for all the injuries done them by her father. While &s;he yet hung upon his knees, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
<PB N="286" REF="297">
mixed care&s;&s;es with her entreaties, Ma&s;&s;i|n&s;&s;a found him&s;elf touched with a pa&s;&s;ion that was &s;omething more than pity: he fell in love: he therefore quickly granted her reque&s;t, and finding her not aver&s;e to his &s;ollicitations, the very day they fir&s;t met, was that of their nuptials. The fir&s;t account that Scipio had of this ha&s;ty and unju&s;t marriage, was from the unfortunate Syphax him&s;elf, who attempted to palliate his enmity to Rome, by throwing the blame upon Sophoni&s;ba; and then de&s;cribed the wretchedne&s;s of his &s;ituation, with an eloquence pointed by jealou&s;y. Scipio was in&s;tantly fired with re&s;entment at the conduct of the young king: he now &s;aw that all his former lectures, exhorting to continence and humanity, were but thrown away; he therefore de&s;ired to &s;peak with Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a in private, where he urged the cruelty, the impropriety, and the inju&s;tice of taking the wife of another, and that on the very day, on which he had lo&s;t his liberty and his kingdom: he entreated the young king to recollect his former virtuous re&s;olutions, and re|ject a pa&s;&s;ion that was attended with infamy. Finding however, the&s;e remon&s;trances make no impre&s;&s;ion, he added, that Syphax was now the pri&s;oner of Rome, that he mu&s;t wait upon the &s;enate, and that his queen, who was a pri&s;oner al&s;o, mu&s;t attend him there. Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a now find|ing that the ob&s;tacles to his happine&s;s were in&s;ur|mountable,
<PB N="287" REF="298">
left the general in a &s;eeming acquie&s;cence in his advice, but feeling all that tumult of pa&s;&s;ions, which di&s;appointed love, and ungoverned inclination could excite, at la&s;t, called one of his &s;laves who carried poi|&s;on, according to the cu&s;tom of barbarian kings, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go," &s;aid he, "and pre&s;ent the queen, from me, with a bowl of poi&s;on; death is now the only way &s;he has left of e&s;caping the power of the Romans.

<P>In the mean time, while the&s;e things were tran&s;acting at Cirta, the Carthaginians were &s;o terrified at their repeated defeats, and the fame of Scipio's former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, that they deter|mined to recall Hannibal, their great champion, out of Italy, in order to oppo&s;e the Romans at home.

the regret and di&s;appointment of Hanni|bal, upon receiving this order; he had long fore&s;een the ruin of his country, but at the &s;ame time knew, that Italy was the only place, in which its fate could be &s;u&s;pended. However, he obeyed the orders of the infatuated people, with the &s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that the meane&s;t &s;ol|dier would have done, and took leave of Italy, with tears in his eyes, after having kept po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t beautiful parts of it for above fifteen years.</P>
<P>After a melancholly pa&s;&s;age from Italy, where he had lo&s;t his two brothers, and mo&s;t of his brave&s;t generals, and left the allies of his country to the fury of the conquerors, he arrived at Leptis, in Africa, from whence he marched to Adrumetum, and at la&s;t approached Zama, a city within five days journey of Carthage. Scipio, in the mean time, led his army to meet him, joined by Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, with &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e, and to &s;hew his rival in the field, how little he feared his approach, &s;ent back the &s;pies, which were &s;ent to explore his camp, having previou&s;ly &s;hewn them the whole, with direc|tions to inform Hannibal of what they had &s;een. The Carthaginian general &s;oon found out the &s;uperior force of the enemy, compo&s;ed of the flower of the Romans, while his own army was now but a mixture of various nations, drawn together by nece&s;&s;ity, with no experience,
<PB N="289" REF="300">
and with little other di&s;cipline, but what the &s;hort time he commanded them could give. The troops that almo&s;t &s;ubdued all Italy were worn out, or but nominally exi&s;ting in his army. Con&s;cious of this therefore, his fir&s;t endeavours were to di&s;continue the war by negotiation; and he therefore de&s;ired a meeting with Scipio, to confer upon terms of peace, to which the Roman general a&s;&s;ented. It was in a large plain between the two armies, that the two greate&s;t generals in the world came to this interview: both, for a while, &s;ilently regarded his opponent, as if &s;truck with mutual reverence and e&s;teem. Scipio was, in figure, adorned with all advan|tages of manly beauty; Hannibal bore the marks in his vi&s;age, of hard campaigns, and being blind of one eye, it gave a &s;tern air to his countenance. Hannibal &s;poke fir&s;t, to this effect: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were I not convinced of the equity of the Romans, I would not this day have come to demand peace from the &s;on, over who&s;e father I have formerly been victorious. Would to heaven, that the &s;ame moderation, which I hope in&s;pires us at this day, had pre|vailed among us at the beginning of the war; that you had been content with the limits of your Italian dominions, and that we had ne|ver aimed at adding Sicily to our empire: we had then on both &s;ides &s;pared that blood, which no rewards from victory can repay.
<PB N="290" REF="301">
As for my&s;elf, age has taught me the inanity of triumphs, and the in&s;tability of fortune: but you are young, and perhaps, not yet le&s;&s;oned in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity; you are now, what I was, after the battles of Cannae and Thra&s;ymene; you perhaps will aim at &s;plendid, rather than at u&s;eful virtues. But con&s;ider, that peace is the end at which all victories aim, and that peace, I am &s;ent here by my country to offer: do not therefore, expo&s;e to the hazard of an hour, that fame which you have obtained by an age of conque&s;ts. At pre&s;ent, Scipio, fortune is in your power, a moment of time may give it to your enemy. But let me not call my&s;elf &s;uch; it is Hannibal that now addre&s;&s;es you, Hannibal that e&s;teems your vir|tues, and de&s;ires your friend&s;hip. Peace will be u&s;eful to us both; as for me, I &s;hall be proud of the alliance of Rome, and as for you, you will convert an active enemy into a &s;tedfa&s;t friend."</Q> To this Scipio replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That as to the wars which he complained of, as they were begun by the Carthaginians, &s;o they mu&s;t abide by the con&s;equence. That as to him&s;elf, he could never condemn his own per&s;everance on the &s;ide of ju&s;|tice. That &s;ome late outrages had been committed during a late truce, which re|quired the greater reparation, which if con|&s;ented
<PB N="291" REF="302">
to, he was willing to conclude a treaty."</Q> Both &s;ides parting di&s;&s;atisfied, they returned to their camps, to prepare for deciding the controver&s;y by the &s;word. Never was a more memorable battle fought, whether we regard the generals, the armies, the two &s;tates that contended, or the empire that was in di&s;pute. The di&s;po&s;ition Hannibal made of his men, is &s;aid, by the &s;killful in the art of war, to be &s;uperior to any, even of his former arrangements. He encouraged the various nations of his army, by the differing motives which led them to the field; to the mercenaries, he promi&s;ed a di&s;|charge of their arrears, and double pay, with plunder, in ca&s;e of a victory; the Gauls he in|&s;pired, by aggravating their natural hatred to the Romans; the Numidians, by repre&s;enting the cruelty of their new king; and the Cartha|ginians by reminding them of their country, their glory, their danger of &s;ervitude, and their de&s;ire of freedom. Scipio, on the other hand, with a chearful countenance, bade his men re|joice, for that their labours and their dangers were now near an end. That the gods had given Carthage into their hands, and that they &s;hould &s;oon return triumphant to their friends, their wives and their children. The battle began by the elephants, on the &s;ide of the Carthagini|ans, which being terrified by the cries of the Ro|mans, and wounded by the &s;lingers and archers,
<PB N="292" REF="303">
turned upon them&s;elves, and cau&s;ed much con|fu&s;ion in both wings of their army, in which the cavalry was placed. Being thus deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the hor&s;e, in which their greate&s;t &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted, the heavy infantry joined on both &s;ides. The Romans were more vigorous and powerful in the &s;hock, the Car|thaginians more active and ready. However, they were unable to with&s;tand the continued pre&s;&s;ure of the Roman &s;hields, but at fir&s;t gave way a little, and this &s;oon brought on a gene|ral flight. The rear guard, who had orders from Hannibal to oppo&s;e tho&s;e that fled, now began to attack their own forces, &s;o that the body of the infantry &s;u&s;tained a double encounter, of tho&s;e who cau&s;ed their flight, and tho&s;e who endeavoured to prevent it. At length however, the general finding that they were not to be made to &s;tand, directed, that they &s;hould fall behind, while he brought up his fre&s;h forces to oppo&s;e the pur&s;uers. Scipio, upon this, im|mediately &s;ounded a retreat, in order to bring up his men a &s;econd time in good order. And now the combat began afre&s;h, between the flower of both armies. The Carthaginians however, having been deprived of the &s;uc|cour of their elephants and their hor&s;e, and their enemies being &s;tronger of body, were obliged to give ground. In the mean time, Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, who had been in pur&s;uit of their
<PB N="293" REF="304">
cavalry, returning and attacking them in the rear, compleated their defeat. A total rout en&s;ued, twenty thou&s;and men were killed in battle or the pur&s;uit, and as many were taken pri&s;oners. Hannibal, who had done all that a great general and an undaunted &s;oldier could perform, fled with a &s;mall body of hor&s;e to Adrumetum, fortune &s;eeming to delight in confounding his ability, his valour, and expe|rience.</P>
<P>This victory brought on a peace. The Car|thaginians, by Hannibal's advice, offered con|ditions to the Romans, which they dictated, not as rivals, but as &s;overeigns. By this treaty, the Carthaginians were obliged to quit Spain, and all the I&s;lands in the Mediterra|nean &s;ea. They were bound to pay ten thou|&s;and talents in fifty years; to give ho&s;tages for the delivery of their &s;hips and their elephants. To re&s;tore Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a all the territories that had been taken from him, and not to make war in Africa, but by the permi&s;&s;ion of the Romans. Thus ended the &s;econd Punic war, &s;eventeen years after it had begun: Carthage &s;till conti|nued an empire, but without power to defend its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and only waiting the plea&s;ure of the conquerors, when they &s;hould think proper to end the period of its continuance. After the <MILESTONE N="553" UNIT="U. C."> depre&s;&s;ion of this mighty dominion, the Ro|mans were &s;carce engaged but in petty wars,

and obtained mighty victories; whereas before, they had obtained but petty victories, and were engaged in dangerous wars.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. From the end of the &s;econd Punic war to the end of the third, which terminated in the de&s;truction of Carthage.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the conclu&s;ion of &s;o great and long a war as that of Carthage, there &s;eemed to ari&s;e a certain &s;pirit in the Roman republic, un|known till that time. Men, till now had received di&s;tinction from their abilities, their families, their offices, or their virtues: but upon the conque&s;t of &s;uch various countries, &s;uch great riches, and &s;o many &s;laves were brought into Rome, that the manners of the people began to alter. Riches gave them a ta&s;te for plea&s;ures unknown before, and the &s;laves they had taken, were put to tho&s;e offices of labour and hu&s;bandry, that had formerly contributed to harden the warrior, and mark the character of Roman &s;implicity. Their love of their country, and their zeal for the pub|lic good, &s;eemed exhau&s;ted in the war again&s;t Hannibal: many had given up their whole fortunes to the republic, and not find|ing
<PB N="295" REF="306">
that recompence in peace, which the publick was as yet unable to grant them; they &s;uffered neglect patiently for a while, and at la&s;t con|verted their anger at the ingratitude of the &s;tate, into a de&s;ire of private intere&s;t: they &s;ought new connections in &s;ociety, and forget|ting the whole, laboured to form particular dependencies.</P>
<P>The &s;enate however, pro&s;ecuted new wars, ra|ther with a view of keeping the&s;e &s;pirits employ|ed from doing harm to the empire, than of ad|vancing its intere&s;ts. They continued to carry on the Macedonian war again&s;t Philip, who, as was &s;aid before, had entered into an alliance with the Carthaginians, during the conque&s;ts of Hannibal. To this war the Romans were not a little incited by the prayers of the Athe|nians; that polite people, who from once con|trolling the power of Per&s;ia, were now unable to defend them&s;elves. The Rhodians, with At|talus, king of Pergamus, al&s;o entered into the confederacy again&s;t Philip. He was more than once defeated by Galba the con&s;ul, who was &s;ent again&s;t him. He attempted to be&s;iege Athens, but the Romans obliged him to rai&s;e the &s;iege. He attempted to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;treights of Thermopylae, but was driven from them by Quintus Flaminius, with great &s;laughter. He attempted to take re|fuge in The&s;&s;aly, where he was again defeated,
<PB N="296" REF="307">
with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and obliged to beg a peace, upon condition of paying a thou&s;and ta|lents, half down, and the other half in the &s;pace of ten years. The peace with Philip gave the Romans an opportunity of &s;hewing their genero&s;ity, by re&s;toring liberty to Greece. They had for &s;ome time &s;ubmitted to the in&s;titutions of this mo&s;t refined people, and now out of a principle of gratitude, endeavoured to recom|pence their ma&s;ters. The &s;enate therefore &s;ent over ten men of the fir&s;t rank, with Flammi|nius at their head, to proclaim an univer&s;al free|dom, at the I&s;thmian games, where the people were a&s;&s;embled. This was the mo&s;t &s;urprizing and joyful gift that could be imagined, to a people panting after liberty, and who&s;e ance&s;|tors had &s;pent their deare&s;t blood in its cau&s;e. The Greeks gave them all the return that was now in their power, namely, prai&s;e; this &s;atis|fied the Romans, for vanity was now the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the times: and thus ended what was called the fir&s;t Macedonian war, five years after <MILESTONE N="558" UNIT="U. C."> it was la&s;t proclaimed, and twenty after it had begun.</P>
<P>During the continuance of this war, the Gauls, who had joined with Hannibal, received &s;ome &s;ignal overthrows. The Spaniards al&s;o, who had revolted, were quelled by Cato the cen&s;or. The Ligurians, though joining with the Gauls, were &s;ubdued. Nabis, the depo&s;ed king of La|cedaemon,
<PB N="297" REF="308">
oppo&s;ed the Romans, but was forced to &s;ubmit. Scarce any nation or prince of power attempted to oppo&s;e them, that was not over|thrown. Antiochus, king of Syria, was a mo|narch, who&s;e &s;trength and fame invited their ambition, and after &s;ome emba&s;&s;ies on the one &s;ide and the other, a war was declared again&s;t him, five years after the conclu&s;ion of the Ma|cedonian war. The pretext of the Romans was, <MILESTONE N="536"> that he had made encroachments upon the Gre|cian &s;tates, who were their allies, and that he had given refuge to Hannibal, their inveterate enemy, who had been expelled from Carthage. This Antiochus, who was &s;urnamed the Great, was one of Alexander's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, a potent prince, bold, ambitious, and ma&s;ter of very exten&s;ive dominions, which his per&s;onal abilities invigo|rated and in&s;pired. The Aetolians, who had ima|gined they &s;hould bear &s;way in Greece by joining with the Romans, found too late, that they had only brought them&s;elves to &s;hare the ge|neral &s;ubjection, in which the re&s;t of the &s;tates of Greece were held, under the &s;pecious deno|mination of freedom. In order therefore, to correct one extravagance by another, they had invited this prince among them, in the &s;ame manner, as before they had invited the Ro|mans. He accordingly came to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, but with an army, rather as if he in|tended only to be a &s;pectator, than a manager
<PB N="298" REF="309">
of the war, and in&s;tead of preparing for the Romans, &s;ate down at Ephe&s;us to take his plea&s;ures. Being however, apprized of the ene|mies approach, he endeavoured to treat for a peace; this not &s;ucceeding, he placed his de|pendance on his maritime forces; but even there his expectations were fru&s;trated, though the great Hannibal was his admiral. In the mid&s;t of the con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned by the&s;e misfortunes, he abandoned Ly&s;imachia, a place where he might have held the enemy for a year, and adding one indi&s;cretion to another, &s;uffered Scipio, brother to the famous Africa|nus, to pa&s;s the Helle&s;pont with his army, without oppo&s;ition. He then attempted to ob|tain a peace, by offering to quit all places in Europe, and &s;uch in A&s;ia as profe&s;t alliance with Rome. But it was now too late, the Ro|man general perceived his own &s;uperiority, and was re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of it. Antiochus thus driven into re&s;i&s;tance, for &s;ome time re|treated before the enemy, till being pre&s;&s;ed hard, near the city of Magne&s;ia, he was forced to draw out his men, to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and foot, and twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e. Sci|pio oppo&s;ed him with forces, as much inferior in number, as they were &s;uperior in courage and di&s;cipline. He was in a &s;hort time entirely defeated, his own chariots, armed with &s;cythes, being driven back upon his men, contributed
<PB N="299" REF="310">
much to his overthrow. Antiochus thus re|duced to the la&s;t extremity, was glad to pro|cure peace of the Romans, upon their own terms, which were, to pay fifteen thou&s;and ta|lents towards the expences of the war; to quit all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Europe, and likewi&s;e all in A&s;ia, on that &s;ide Mount Taurus; to give twenty ho&s;tages as pledges of his fidelity, and to deliver up Hannibal, the inveterate enemy of Rome. Thus ended the war with Antiochus, twelve years after the &s;econd Punic war, and two after it had been begun. Lucius Scipio, who conducted it, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brother Scipio Africanus, who went as his lieu|tenant, was called A&s;iaticus, from his &s;ucce&s;s in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Hannibal, who&s;e de&s;truc|tion was one of the articles of this extorted treaty, endeavoured to avoid the threatened ruin. This con&s;ummate general had been long a wan|derer, and an exile from his ungrateful coun|try: all that prudence or ju&s;tice could in&s;pire, he had done for the &s;afety of Carthage, even after the battle which he had lo&s;t at Zama. Upon his return to his native city, he found the public trea&s;ures exhau&s;ted among tho&s;e who pretended to collect them, and when he endea|voured to puni&s;h their avarice, they accu&s;ed him to the Romans, of attempting to renew the war. This bringing on a demand that he
<PB N="300" REF="311">
&s;hould be delivered up, he re&s;olved to yield to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and fly. Thus leav|ing Carthage, in the very robe he wore in council, and attended only by two followers, who were ignorant of his intentions, he began his voluntary exile. After two days travelling by land, he embarked, and landed on a little i&s;land in the Mediterranean &s;ea. There being known by one who had formerly fought under his command, he was quickly &s;urrounded by the inhabitants, who came from motives of re|verence and curio&s;ity. From thence he failed to Tyre, where he met with a kind reception from the inhabitants, who remembered their ancient alliance with Carthage. He thence went to the court of Antiochus, who at fir&s;t gave him a &s;incere welcome, and made him admiral of his fleet, in which &s;tation he &s;hewed his u&s;ual &s;kill in &s;tratagem. But he &s;oon &s;unk in the Syrian's e&s;teem, for having advi&s;ed &s;chemes, which that monarch had neither genius to under&s;tand, nor talents to execute, particularly, that of a &s;econd inva&s;ion of Italy. At la&s;t, finding him&s;elf de&s;|tined to be given up, in order to propitiate the Romans, and confirm the peace, and finding no hopes of &s;afety or protection there, he de|parted by &s;tealth, and after wandering for a time among petty &s;tates, who had neither power nor genero&s;ity to protect him, he took refuge at the court of Pru&s;ias, king of Bithynia. Howe|ver

the Romans, with a vindictive &s;pirit utterly unworthy of them, &s;ent Aemilius, one of their mo&s;t celebrated generals, to demand him of this king, who fearing the re&s;entment of Rome, and willing to conciliate their friend&s;hip by this breach of ho&s;pitality, ordered a guard to be placed upon Hannibal, with an intention of delivering him up. The old general, thus im|placably per&s;ecuted from one country to an|other, and finding all methods of &s;afety cut off, determined to die: he therefore, de&s;ired one of his followers to bring him poi&s;on, which he had prepared for this exigence, and while he was preparing to take it,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let us rid the Romans," &s;ays he, "of their terrors, &s;ince they are unwilling to wait for the death of an old man like me: there was a time, when there was more genero&s;ity remaining among them, they have been known to guard their enemy from poi&s;on, and now they ba&s;ely &s;end an emba&s;&s;y to &s;eek the life of a bani&s;hed man, and to make a feeble monarch break the laws of ho&s;pitality."</Q> Thus &s;aying, and drinking the poi&s;on, he expired, as he had lived, with intrepid bravery.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the&s;e things were doing abroad, the &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ention &s;eemed to rekindle in Rome. In the third year after end|ing the war with Antiochus, the tribunes of the people undertook to accu&s;e Scipio Africanus of
<PB N="302" REF="313">
defrauding the trea&s;ury of the plunder which was taken in war, and of too intimate a cor|re&s;pondence with that king. Accordingly, a day was &s;et him by the tribunes to an&s;wer for his conduct. Scipio appeared at the appointed time, but in&s;tead of attempting a defence, he reminded his countrymen, that on that very day he had gained the victory of Zama. This &s;truck the a&s;&s;embly of the people &s;o &s;trongly, that they all left the tribunes in the Forum, and went to attend Scipio to the Capitol, to return their annual thanks to the gods for the victory. The tribunes finding them&s;elves di&s;|appointed here, were re&s;olved to accu&s;e him in the &s;enate, and de&s;ired, that he &s;hould bring his accounts to an&s;wer to their charge. Scipio, in&s;tead of gratifying them even in this, tore his accounts before them, and &s;oon after withdrew to Linternum, a town on the coa&s;t of Campa|nia, where he &s;pent the re&s;t of his life in peace and privacy: he lived however, but three years longer, te&s;tifying his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t his countrymen, by the epitaph which he ordered to be engraved on his tomb: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ungrateful country, my very bones &s;hall not re&s;t among you."</Q> This was the &s;ame year on which Hannibal died, as al&s;o Philopoemen, a Grecian <MILESTONE N="571"> general, who was reckoned equal to either of the former.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="314">
The factious &s;pirit which was now excited in the republic continued for &s;ome years, during all their &s;ub&s;equent wars and victories over the Ligurians, I&s;trians, Sardinians, Cor&s;icans, and Macedonians, for the Romans &s;oon after entered into a &s;econd Macedonian war. This was with <MILESTONE N="583"> Per&s;eus the &s;on of Philip, the king of that country, whom we have already &s;een obliged to beg a peace of the Romans. Per&s;eus, in or|der to &s;ecure the crown, had contrived to mur|der his brother Demetrius, and upon the death of his father, plea&s;ed with the hopes of imagi|nary triumphs, made war again&s;t Rome. During the cour&s;e of this war, which continued about three years, many opportunities were offered him of cutting off the Roman army, but being perfectly ignorant of making his advantage of their ra&s;hne&s;s, he &s;pent the time in empty over|tures for a peace. At length, Aemilius gave him a deci&s;ive overthrow near the river Enipeus. He attempted to procure &s;afety by flying into Crete, but being abandoned by all, he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf, and to grace the &s;plendid triumph of the Roman general. He was led, with his two &s;ons, before the conquer|or's chariot, into Rome; while Gentius, king of the Illyrians, and his confederates, was in the &s;ame manner led captive, before the chariot of Lucius Amicius, one of the Roman admirals.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="315">
The&s;e wars, which brought immen&s;e riches into the Roman trea&s;ury, were no &s;ooner fini&s;hed&punc; than they found a pretext to enter upon the third and la&s;t Punic war. Carthage was now a &s;tate that only &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the mercy of the con|querors, and was to fall at the &s;lighte&s;t breath of their indignation. About this time, Ma&s;&s;i|ni&s;&s;a, the Numidian, having made &s;ome incur|&s;ions into a territory claimed by the Carthagi|nians, they attempted to repel the inva&s;ion. This brought on a war between that monarch and them, while the Romans, who pretended to con&s;ider this conduct of theirs as an infrac|tion of the treaty, &s;ent to them to make com|plaint. The amba&s;&s;adors who were employed upon this occa&s;ion finding the city very rich and flouri&s;hing, from the long interval of peace which it had now enjoyed for near fifty years, either from motives of avarice to po&s;&s;e&s;s its plunder, or from fear of its growing greatne&s;s, in&s;i&s;ted much on the nece&s;&s;ity of a war. Among the chief of the&s;e was Cato, who never &s;poke in the &s;enate upon public bu&s;ine&s;s, but he ended his &s;peech, by inculcating the nece&s;&s;ity of de|&s;troying Carthage. It was in vain that he was oppo&s;ed by Na&s;ica, who with more &s;agacious foreca&s;t urged the danger of de&s;troying a rival &s;tate, that &s;till would be an incentive to Roman di&s;cipline. Cato's opinion prevailed, and the &s;enate having a fair pretence to begin, ordered
<PB N="305" REF="316">
war to be proclaimed, and the con&s;uls &s;et out with a thorough re&s;olution utterly to demoli&s;h Carthage.</P>
<P>The Carthaginians, now too late, perceived the wi&s;dom of Hannibal, who had fore&s;een the con&s;equences of their conduct, but it was not till they had found their want of him. Af|frighted at the Roman preparations, (for they had, during this long period, been only intent on ama&s;&s;ing private wealth, and no way careful for public &s;afety) they immediately condemned tho&s;e who had broken the league, and mo&s;t hum|bly offered any rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction. To the&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, the &s;enate only returned an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, demanding three hundred ho&s;tages within thirty days, as a &s;ecurity for their future conduct, and an implicit obedience to their fur|ther commands. With the&s;e articles it was &s;up|po&s;ed the Carthaginians would not comply, but it turned out otherwi&s;e, for this infatuated people de&s;iring peace on any terms, &s;ent their children within the limitted time, and the con|&s;uls landing at Utica &s;oon after, were waited upon by deputies from Carthage, to know the &s;enate's further demands, as certain of a ready compliance. Upon this, the Roman generals were not a little perplexed, in what manner to force them into di&s;obedience; wherefore Cen|&s;orinus the con&s;ul, commending their diligence, demanded all their arms; but the&s;e al&s;o, con|trary
<PB N="306" REF="317">
to expectation, they delivered up. At la&s;t, they found that the conquerors would not de&s;i&s;t making demands, while the vanqui&s;hed had any thing left to &s;upply. They now therefore re|ceived orders to leave their city, which was to be levelled with the ground, being granted, at the &s;ame time, permi&s;&s;ion to build another, in any part of their territories, within ten miles of the &s;ea. This &s;evere command they received with all the concern and di&s;tre&s;s of a de&s;pairing peo|ple: they implored for a re&s;pite from &s;uch an hard &s;entence; they u&s;ed tears and lamenta|tions,: but finding the con&s;uls inexorable, they departed with a gloomy re&s;olution, prepared to &s;uffer the utmo&s;t extremities, and to fight to the la&s;t for their &s;eat of empire, and ancient habi|tation.</P>
<P>Upon returning home, and divulging the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their commi&s;&s;ion, a general &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance &s;eemed to in&s;pire the whole people; they now, too late began to &s;ee the danger of riches in a &s;tate, when it had no longer power to defend them. Tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els therefore, of gold and &s;ilver which their luxury had taken &s;uch pride in, were converted into arms, as they had given up their iron, which was in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, the mo&s;t precious metal. The women parted al&s;o with their or|naments, and even cut off their hair to be con|verted into &s;trings for the bowmen. A&s;drubal,
<PB N="307" REF="318">
who had been lately condemned for oppo&s;ing the Romans, was now taken from pri&s;on to head their army; and &s;uch preparations were made, that when the con&s;uls came before the city, which they expected to find an ea&s;y con|que&s;t, they met &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance, as quite di&s;pi|rited their forces, and &s;hook their re&s;olution. Several engagements were fought before the walls, with di&s;advantage to the a&s;&s;ailants, &s;o that the &s;iege would have been di&s;continued, had not Scipio Aemilianus, the adopted &s;on of Africanus, who was now appointed to com|mand it, u&s;ed as much &s;kill to &s;ave his forces after a defeat, as to in&s;pire them with fre&s;h hopes of victory. But all his arts would have failed, had he not found means to &s;educe Phar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the ma&s;ter of the Carthaginian hor&s;e, who came over to his &s;ide. He from that time went on &s;ucce&s;sfully; that part of Carthage called Megara, was the fir&s;t that was taken, while the inhabitants were driven into the citadel. He then &s;ecured the i&s;thmus which led to the city, and thus cut off all &s;upplies of provi&s;ions from the country. He next blocked up the haven, but the be&s;ieged, with incredible indu&s;try, cut out a new pa&s;&s;age into the &s;ea, whereby, at cer|tain times, they could receive nece&s;&s;aries from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> army without. That army therefore, was t be &s;ubdued, ere the city could be thorough|ly inve&s;ted. Wherefore, Scipio &s;et upon them in
<PB N="308" REF="319">
the beginning of the en&s;uing winter, killed &s;eventy thou&s;and of their men, and took ten thou&s;and pri&s;oners of war. The unhappy town&s;men, now bereft of all external &s;uccour, re&s;olved upon every extremity, rather than &s;ubmit: but they &s;oon &s;aw the enemy make nearer approaches; the wall which led to the haven was quickly demoli&s;hed; &s;oon after, the Forum it&s;elf was taken, which offered the conquerors, a de|plorable &s;pectacle of hou&s;es tottering to the fall, heaps of men lying dead beneath, hundreds of the wounded &s;truggling to emerge from the carnage around them, and deploring their own and their country's ruin. The citadel &s;oon af|ter &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. All now but the temple was &s;ubdued, and that was defended by de&s;erters, and tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t for|ward to undertake the war. The&s;e however, expecting no mercy, and finding their condition de&s;perate, &s;et fire to the building, and volunta|rily peri&s;hed in the flames. A&s;drubal the Car|thaginian general delivered him&s;elf up to the Ro|mans, when the citadel was taken, but his wife and two children ru&s;hed into the temple while yet on fire, and expired with their country. Then was this magnificent city laid in a&s;hes by the mer|cile&s;s conquerors, and &s;o exten&s;ive was it, being twenty-four miles in compa&s;s, that the burning continued for &s;eventeen days together. The &s;enate of Rome ordered that no part of it &s;hould
<PB N="309" REF="320">
be rebuilt; it was demoli&s;hed to the ground, &s;o that travellers are unable to &s;ay where Car|thage &s;tood, at this day. All the cities which a&s;&s;i&s;ted Carthage in this war, were ordered to &s;hare the &s;ame fate, and the lands belonging to them were given to the friends of the Romans. The other towns of Afric became tributary to Rome, and were governed by an annual praetor; while the numberle&s;s captives who were taken in the cour&s;e of this war, were &s;old as &s;laves, except &s;ome few, who were adjudged to die by the hands of the executioner. This was the end of one of the mo&s;t renowned cities in the world, both for arts, opulence, and extent of dominion; it had rivalled Rome for above an hundred years, and at one time, was thought to have the &s;uperiority. But all the grandeur of Carthage was founded on commerce alone, which is ever fluctuating, and at be&s;t, &s;erves to dre&s;s up a nation, to invite conque&s;t, and only to adorn the victim for its de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This conque&s;t over Carthage, was &s;oon fol|lowed by many over other &s;tates. Corinth, one of the noble&s;t cities of Greece, in the &s;ame year, &s;u&s;tained the &s;ame fate, being entered by Mummius the con&s;ul, and levelled to the ground. The pretext for this violence was, that the Achaeans had declared war again&s;t the Lacedaemonians, who were in alliance with Rome. Metellus the con&s;ul, in con&s;equence of
<PB N="310" REF="321">
this, drawing his army into Baeotia, overthrew their general Critolaus, and Mummius &s;ucceed|ing him in the command, overthrew Dicas, the Achean general, and in con&s;equence entered and demoli&s;hed Corinth, the &s;poils of which afterwards, not a little contributed to embelli&s;h Rome. Spain, though at fir&s;t victorious, was &s;oon after entirely &s;ubdued. Viriatus the Spani&s;h commander, who, from a &s;hepherd became a robber, and from that, a general over a numerous body of men like him&s;elf, gave the Romans &s;ome trouble, but was taken off by the ba&s;e&s;t treachery. Cae|pio, the Roman general, having bribed his own amba&s;&s;adors, who were &s;ent to treat of a peace, to murder their ma&s;ter in his bed, upon their return. Quintus Pompeius and Mancianus al&s;o gained no greater honour, by combating this brave people: they were both obliged, in order to &s;ave their armies, to make &s;o di&s;advantageous a treaty, that the &s;enate, by a mean &s;ubterfuge, &s;ent back Mancianus bound, for concluding upon terms, with which they refu&s;ed to concur. Lepidus al&s;o was equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, for &s;et|ting upon the Vaccaei, an harmle&s;s and peace|able people of that country, he was entirely defeated. At la&s;t however, Scipio, who had de&s;troyed Carthage, (and who now, like the former of that name, was al&s;o &s;urnamed Afri|canus) being made con&s;ul, re&s;tored the for|tune of Rome, and laying &s;iege to Numantia,
<PB N="311" REF="322">
the &s;tronge&s;t city in Spain, the wretched inha|bitants, to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy, fired the city over their own heads, and all, to a man, expired in the flames: thus Spain became a province to Rome, and was governed thenceforward by two annual praetors. From this treatment given to the conquered, we &s;ee how very different the Romans were from their ance&s;tors, who&s;e boa&s;t it was, to u&s;e lenity to tho&s;e whom they had &s;ubdued. But few nations can with&s;tand the intoxication of &s;ucce&s;s, as they began to con&s;ider the whole world as their own, they re&s;olved to treat all tho&s;e who with&s;tood their arms, not as oppo&s;ers, but revolters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. From the de&s;truction of Carthage to the end of the &s;edition of the Gracchi.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto &s;een this great people, by <MILESTONE N="621" UNIT="U. C."> &s;low degrees, ri&s;ing into power, and at length, reigning without a rival. We have hitherto &s;een all the virtues which give &s;trength and con|que&s;t, one by one, entering into the &s;tate, and forming an unconquerable empire. From this time forward, we are to &s;urvey a different pic|ture; a powerful &s;tate, giving admi&s;&s;ion to all
<PB N="312" REF="323">
the vices that tend to divide, en&s;lave, and at la&s;t, totally de&s;troy it. This &s;eems to be the great period of Roman power, their conque&s;ts afterwards, might be more numerous, and their dominions more exten&s;ive, but their ex|ten&s;ion was rather an increa&s;e of glory, than of &s;trength. For a long time, even after the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of their vices, the benefits of their for|mer virtues continued to operate; but their fu|ture triumphs rather &s;pread their power, than increa&s;ed it, they rather gave it &s;urface than &s;o|lidity. They now began daily to degenerate from their ancient mode&s;ty, plainne&s;s, and &s;eve|rity of life. The triumphs and the &s;poils of A&s;ia, brought in a ta&s;te for &s;plendid expence, and the&s;e produced avarice and inverted ambition, &s;o that from henceforward, the hi&s;tory &s;eems that of another people.</P>
<P>The two Gracchi were the fir&s;t who &s;aw this &s;trange corruption among the great, and re|&s;olved to repre&s;s it, by renewing the Licinian law, which, as we have &s;een, had enacted, that no per&s;on in the &s;tate &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s above five hundred acres of land, but that the overplus &s;hould become the property of the &s;tate. Ti|berius Gracchus, the elder of the two, was a per&s;on very con&s;iderable both for the advantages of his body, and the qualities of his mind. Very different from Scipio, of whom he was the grand&s;on, he &s;eemed more ambitious of
<PB N="313" REF="324">
power, than de&s;irous of glory: he had a mind fonder of embracing novelties, than of advanc|ing or &s;upporting e&s;tabli&s;hments already made: his contempt of money was apparent, and this only &s;erved to le&s;&s;en his power in a country, that now began to &s;et an immoderate value on riches: his compa&s;&s;ion for the oppre&s;&s;ed, was equal to his animo&s;ity again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ors: but unhappily his pa&s;&s;ions, rather than his rea|&s;on, operated even in his pur&s;uits of virtue, and the&s;e always drove him beyond the line of duty: his de&s;igns &s;eemed, in the main, hone&s;t, but oppo&s;ition put his intentions into di&s;order, and though he began with principles of ju&s;tice, he was at la&s;t obliged to exchange his rectitude, for his party. This was the di&s;po&s;ition of the elder Gracchus, who found the lower part of the people, (for the di&s;tinction between patrician and plebeian, was now no more) ready to &s;e|cond all his propo&s;als. The&s;e, after long &s;er|vices to the &s;tate, found them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the oppre&s;&s;ions of the rich, who by wre&s;ting the laws, of which they had the management in their own favour, &s;eized upon all the pro|perty, and left the poor only the danger and fatigue of defending it. Their continual inju|ries however, had alienated the hearts of the multitude, which they concealed, or thought it their duty to &s;uffer; while the &s;enate, unju&s;t, corrupt, and mercenary, were only intent on
<PB N="314" REF="325">
covering their internal meanne&s;s, by the dignity of their conque&s;ts abroad. This was the &s;tate of parties, when Tiberius Gracchus procured him&s;elf to be cho&s;en tribune of the people. It was he that had formerly attempted to retrench the power of Scipio Africanus, and had &s;et him a day to an&s;wer before the people; and that now prevailed for preferring the Licinian law, by which it was prohibited, that any per&s;on &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s above five hundred acres of land. But willing to prevent this law being wre&s;ted to the advantage of the great, as it had hitherto been, he cau&s;ed it to be enacted al&s;o, that one half or the illicit &s;urplus &s;hould be given to the children of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and the other half given to &s;uch of the poor as had nothing; and le&s;t any, by purcha&s;e, &s;hould enlarge their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, three officers were appointed, called the Triumviri, who were to determine and examine the quantity of land occupied by every indivi|dual. This law, though at fir&s;t carried on with proper moderation, greatly di&s;gu&s;ted the rich, who endeavoured to per&s;uade the people, that the propo&s;er only aimed at di&s;turbing the go|vernment, and putting all things into confu&s;ion. But Gracchus, who was a man of the greate&s;t eloquence of his time, ea&s;ily wiped off the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, from minds already irritated with their wrongs&punc; and be&s;ides, willing enough to for|ward a law, by which they were to be the only
<PB N="315" REF="326">
gainers. But while the poor were eager for pa&s;&s;ing this law, the rich were equally &s;trenuous in oppo&s;ing it. What was in the beginning but debate, by degrees grew into enmity, and the oppo&s;ition &s;eemed to kindle as it proceeded. Octavius, one of the tribunes who oppo&s;ed the law, was partly by art, and partly by violence, obliged to re&s;ign, while Mummius, who was in the oppo&s;ite confederacy, was elected tribune in his &s;tead. The death of Attalus, king of Per|gamus, furni&s;hed Tiberius Gracchus with a new opportunity of gratifying the meaner part of the people, at the expence of the great. This king had by his la&s;t will left the Romans his he rs, and it was now propo&s;ed, that the mo|ney &s;o left, &s;hould be divided among the poor, in order to furni&s;h them with proper uten&s;ils for cultivating the lands which became theirs by the late law of partition. This cau&s;ed &s;till greater di&s;turbances than before: the &s;enate a&s;|&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion, in order to con&s;ult the mo&s;t proper methods of &s;ecuring the&s;e riches to them&s;elves, which they now valued above the &s;afety of the commonwealth: they had nume|merous dependants, who were willing to give up liberty for plenty and ea&s;e: the&s;e therefore, were commanded to to be in readine&s;s, to in|timidate the people, who expected no &s;uch op|po&s;ition, and who were now attending to the harrangue of Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol.
<PB N="316" REF="327">
Here, as a clamour was rai&s;ed by the clients of the great on one &s;ide, and by the favourers of the law on the other, Tiberius found his &s;peech intirely interrupted, and begged in vain to be attended to, till at la&s;t, rai&s;ing his hand to his head, to intimate that his life was in dan|ger, the partizans of the &s;enate gave out, that he wanted a diadem. In con&s;equence of this, an univer&s;al uproar now &s;pread it&s;elf through all ranks of people; the corrupt part of the &s;e|nate were of opinion, that the con&s;ul &s;hould defend the commonwealth by force of arms; but this prudent magi&s;trate declining &s;uch violence, Scipio Na&s;ica, kin&s;man to Gracchus, ro&s;e up, and preparing him&s;elf for the conte&s;t, de&s;ired that all who would defend the dignity and the authority of the laws, &s;hould follow him. Upon this, attended by a large body of &s;enators and clients, armed with clubs, he went directly up to the Capitol, &s;triking down all who ventured to re&s;i&s;t. Gracchus perceiving by the tumult, that his life was &s;ought for, endeavoured to fly, and throwing a&s;ide his robe to expedite his e&s;|cape, attempted to get through the throng, but happening to fall over a per&s;on already on the ground, Saturinus, one of his colleagues in the tribune&s;hip, who was of the oppo&s;ite faction, &s;truck him dead with a piece of a &s;eat; and not le&s;s than three hundred of his hearers &s;hared the &s;ame fate, being killed in the tumult. Nor
<PB N="317" REF="328">
did the vengeance of the &s;enate re&s;t here, but extended to numbers of tho&s;e who &s;eemed to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, many of them were put to death, many were bani&s;hed, and nothing was omitted to in&s;pire the people with an abhor|rence for his pretended crimes.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, though for a little while interrupted by a victory gained by Ari&s;tonicus, ba&s;tard brother to the late king of Pergamus, and pretender to his crown, over the Roman con&s;ul, Licinius Cra&s;&s;us, were &s;oon renewed again. For Ari&s;tonicus being overthrown by Perpenna, the con&s;ul, then be&s;ieged in Strato|nice, and compelled by famine to &s;urrender, was, after gracing the conqueror's triumph, &s;trangled in pri&s;on by order of the &s;enate, which afforded an opportunity to the people, for re|newing the former animo&s;ities, headed by Caius Gracchus, the brother of him who was &s;lain.</P>
<P>Caius Gracchus was but twenty-one upon the death of his brother Tiberius, and as he was too young to be much dreaded by the great, &s;o he was at fir&s;t unwilling to incur their re&s;ent|ment, by aims beyond his reach; he therefore lived in retirement, un&s;een and almo&s;t forgot|ten. But while he thus &s;eemed de&s;irous of avoiding popularity, he was employing his &s;o|litude in the &s;tudy of eloquence, which was the readie&s;t means to obtain it: at length, when he
<PB N="318" REF="329">
thought him&s;elf qualified to &s;erve his country, he offered him&s;elf candidate for the que&s;tor&s;hip to the army in Sardinia, which he readily ob|tained. His valour, affability, and temperance in this office was remarked by all. The king of Numidia &s;ending a pre&s;ent of corn to the Ro|mans, ordered his amba&s;&s;adors to &s;ay, that it was entirely as a tribute to the virtues of Caius Grac|chus. This the &s;enate treated with &s;corn, and ordered the amba&s;&s;adors to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with contempt, as ignorant barbarians, which &s;o in|flamed the re&s;entment of young Gracchus, that he immediately came from the army, to com|plain of the indignity thrown upon his reputa|tion, and to offer him&s;elf for tribune of the people It was then that the great found in this youth, who had been hitherto neglected upon account of his age, a more formidable an|tagoni&s;t, than even his brother had been; his eloquence again&s;t the calumnies which were laid to his charge, exceeded whatever had been heard in Rome, and his intrepidity in &s;upport|ing his preten&s;ions equalied the re&s;t of his vir|tues. Notwith&s;tanding the warme&s;t oppo&s;ition from the &s;enate, he was declared tribune, by a very large majority, and he now prepared to run the &s;ame career which his brother had gone before him.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t effort was to have Popilius, one of the mo&s;t inveterate of his brother's enemies,
<PB N="319" REF="330">
cited before the the people, who, rather than &s;tand the event of a trial, cho&s;e to go into vo|luntary bani&s;hment. He next procured an edict, granting the freedom of the city to the inhabi|tants of Latium, and &s;oon after, to all the peo|ple on that &s;ide the Alps. He afterwards fixed the price of corn to a moderate &s;tandard, and procured a monthly di&s;tribution of it among the people. He then proceeded to an in&s;pection into the late corruptions of the &s;enate, in which the whole body being convicted of bribery, ex|tortion, and the &s;ale of offices, for at that time a total degeneracy &s;eemed to have taken place, a law was made, transferring the power of judging corrupt magi&s;trates, from the &s;enate to the knights, which made a great alteration in the con&s;titution. The number of the&s;e officers, thus placed as in&s;pectors over the conduct of all the other magi&s;trates of the &s;tate, amounted to three hundred, and they were cho&s;en from among the friends of Gracchus. Thus, ever at|tentive to the good of the commonwealth, he ordered the highways to be improved and adorn|ed; he cau&s;ed public granaries to be built, and &s;tored with grain again&s;t times of &s;carcity; and to give a pattern of ju&s;tice to the people, he cau&s;ed large quantities of corn, which Fabius the propraetor in Spain had extorted from his government, and had pre&s;ented as a large&s;s to the people, to be &s;old, and the money re|mitted

to the injured owners. In &s;hort, on whatever &s;ide we view the character of this great man, we &s;hall find him ju&s;t, temperate, wi&s;e, active, and &s;eemingly, born to re&s;tore the an|cient &s;implicity of Rome. However, hi&s;torians pretend to a&s;&s;ert, that all his aims were to extend his own power, and that all his virtues were but the children of his ambition. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions however, do not &s;eem verified in any of the actions of his life, which they have recorded; however, it is not for the moderns to di&s;pute with ancient hi&s;torians upon characters of antiquity; they knew be&s;t the men of their own times, and per|haps, have often condemned them in the gro&s;s for defects, which they thought not worth while to mention in the detail.</P>
<P>Gracchus, by the&s;e means being grown not only very popular, but very powerful in the &s;tate, was become an object, at which the &s;enate aimed all their re&s;entment. At fir&s;t, they &s;eem|ed to wait only till his tribune&s;hip expired, in order to wreck their vengeance with &s;afety, but contrary to their expectations, he was cho&s;en a &s;econd time to that office, though without the lea&s;t efforts on his &s;ide to get him&s;elf re-elected. They now therefore re&s;olved to alter their me|thod of proceeding, and endeavoured to oppo&s;e his popularity by &s;etting up a rival. This was Dru&s;us his colleague, who &s;eemed to go even beyond Gracchus in every propo&s;al, and being
<PB N="321" REF="332">
&s;ecretly backed by the &s;enate, &s;o far &s;ucceeded in his &s;chemes, as to divide the affections of the people. The jealou&s;y of Gracchus on this oc|ca&s;ion, quickly blazed out, he treated his col|league with contempt, and as the &s;enate fore|&s;aw, it cau&s;ed a very powerful party of his former admirers, now to declare again&s;t him. But the greate&s;t effort to undo him was yet in re|&s;erve. For from the time of his return to Rome from Sardinia, he had been elected one of the Triumviri, an office, which as I have mentioned before, was appointed by his brother Tiberius, to determine the quantity of land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by each individual in the &s;tate. In this employ|ment Gracchus &s;hewed him&s;elf extremely a&s;&s;i|duous, and impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame &s;pirit of equality that in&s;pired his brother, endeavoured to regulate each man's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, according to the Licinian law, with inflexible ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves aggrieved by his &s;eve|rity, had recour&s;e to Scipio Africanus for re|dre&s;s. Scipio, who had been long an enemy to this law, was too &s;en&s;ible of the people's power, to oppo&s;e it directly, but proceeding with more art, obtained a new officer to be cho&s;en, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;ettle the claims of indivi|duals among&s;t each other, before tho&s;e of the publick could be determined by the Triumviri. For this purpo&s;e, Tuditanus the con&s;ul was cho&s;en, who thus having a power of protract|ing
<PB N="322" REF="333">
the wi&s;hed-for divi&s;ion of lands, for a while, &s;eemed to bend a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to the bu&s;ine&s;s for which he was cho&s;en. However, when he could no longer defer the &s;ettlement of the lands in que&s;tion, he pretended to be called off to quell an in&s;urrection in one of the provinces, and thus left the claims and the wi&s;hes of the people undecided. An univer&s;al murmur now there|fore ro&s;e again&s;t Scipio, by who&s;e arts the exe|cution of the law was protracted, and one of the tribunes even cited him to appear, and give an account how Tiberius Gracchus came to be &s;lain. Scipio however, di&s;dained to an&s;wer the charge, but went home, as &s;ome thought, to meditate a &s;peech for the en&s;uing day, but in the morning he was found dead in his bed, and by a mark round his neck, it appeared that he was &s;trangled. The death of this great man produced much &s;u&s;picion again&s;t the leaders of the popular party, but Gracchus particularly came in for the greate&s;t &s;hare. He however, di&s;dained to vindicate him&s;elf from a crime, of which there were no proofs again&s;t him; but willing to turn the thoughts of the people an|other way, propo&s;ed the rebuilding of Carthage, and peopling it from Rome. This &s;cheme was gladly embraced by the people, and &s;ix thou|&s;and families, with Gracchus at their head, left the city, in order to &s;ettle there. However, they had &s;carce begun to clear away the rubbi&s;h,
<PB N="323" REF="334">
when they were di&s;turbed by &s;everal omens, which to a &s;uper&s;titious people, was &s;ufficient to check the progre&s;s of every undertaking. But much more powerful motives called Gracchus back to Rome, for his enemies, during his ab|&s;ence, u&s;ed all their art to blacken his character, &s;o that he found him&s;elf obliged to return, in order to &s;upport his party, and remove tho&s;e prejudices which had been formed in the minds of the people to his di&s;advantage. But he &s;oon found the populace a faithle&s;s and un&s;teady &s;upport, they began to withdraw all their confi|dence from him, and to place it upon Dru&s;us, who&s;e character was unimpeached. It was in vain, that he de&s;igned new laws in their favour, and called up &s;everal of the inhabitants of the different towns of Italy to his &s;upport, the &s;e|nate ordered them all to depart Rome, and even &s;ent one &s;tranger to pri&s;on whom Gracchus had invited to live with him, and honoured with his table and friend&s;hip. To this indignity was &s;hortly after added a di&s;grace of a more fatal tendency, for &s;tanding for the tribune&s;hip a third time, he was rejected, it being &s;uppo&s;ed, that the officers who&s;e duty it was to make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eturn, were bribed to reject him, though fairly cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The &s;enate no &s;ooner &s;aw Gracchus reduced to a private &s;tation, than they determined to de|&s;troy him, and deputed Opimius the con&s;ul,
<PB N="324" REF="335">
who was his mortal enemy, to be the in&s;tru|ment of their malignity again&s;t him. The con|&s;ul, who, be&s;ide the greate&s;t pride, was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the utmo&s;t cruelty, undertook the of|fice with great readine&s;s, and fir&s;t annulled tho&s;e laws, which were made for e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony at Carthage. He then proceeded to abrogate all the other laws which had been made during his two tribune&s;hips, and &s;et a day for a general a&s;&s;embly of the people for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was now &s;een, that the fate of Gracchus was re&s;olved on. The con&s;ul was not contented with the protection of all the &s;enate and the knights, with a numerous retinue of &s;laves and clients, but ordered a body of Candians, that were mercenaries in the Roman &s;ervice, to fol|low and attend him. Thus guarded, and con|&s;cious of the &s;uperiority of his forces, he in&s;ult|ted Gracchus wherever he met him, doing all in his power to produce a quarrel, in which he might have a pretence of di&s;patching his enemy in the fray. Gracchus however, avoided all re|crimination, and as if apprized of the con&s;ul's de&s;igns, would not even wear any kind of arms for his defence. His friend Flaccus however, a zealous tribune, was not &s;o remi&s;s, but re&s;olved to oppo&s;e party again&s;t party, and for this pur|po&s;e brought up &s;everal countrymen to Rome, who came under a pretence of de&s;iring employ|ment.
<PB N="325" REF="336">
When the day for determining the contro|ver&s;y was arrived, the two parties, early in the morning, attended at the Capitol, where while the con&s;ul was &s;acrificing, according to cu&s;tom, one of the lictors taking up the entrails of the bea&s;t that was &s;lain, in order to remove them, could not forbear crying out to Fulvius and his party, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You, ye factious citizens, make way for hone&s;t men."</Q> This in&s;ult &s;o provoked the party to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, that they in&s;tantly fell upon him, and pierced him to death with the in&s;truments they u&s;ed in writing, which they then happened to have in their hands. This murder cau&s;ed a great di&s;turbance in the a&s;&s;embly, but particularly Gracchus, who &s;aw the con&s;equences that were likely to en&s;ue, reprimanded his party for giving his enemies &s;uch advantage over him; he made many at|tempts to &s;peak, but could not be heard by rea|&s;on of the tumult, wherefore he was at la&s;t obliged to retire homewards, and wait the event. As he was going through the Forum, he &s;topped before a &s;tatue that was rai&s;ed to his father's memory, and regarding it for &s;ome time, he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, as if de|ploring the &s;pirit of the times. His followers were not le&s;s moved than he, and all joining in the &s;orrow, vowed never to abandon a man who&s;e only crime was his affection to his coun|try. In the mean time, the &s;enate took every
<PB N="326" REF="337">
method to allarm the city, and encrea&s;e their apprehen&s;ions of the danger. The con&s;ul was directed, that the commonwealth &s;hould receive no injury, by which form they inve&s;ted him upon this &s;light occa&s;ion, with ab&s;olute and un|controulable power. The dead lictor's cor&s;e was carried in triumph through the &s;treets, and expo&s;ed to view before the &s;enate-hou&s;e, and the whole body of the nobles received orders, to be in arms the next day, with their &s;laves and dependants, upon Mount Aventine. On the other &s;ide, Flaccus was &s;edulou&s;ly employed in getting together the remains of his &s;hattered parti&s;ans; but it was not at pre&s;ent as in the former commotions of the commonwealth, when the plebeians were to be excited agai&s;t the patricians, for tho&s;e di&s;tinctions were long bro|ken down; it was now only an oppo&s;ition be|tween the poor and the rich, and the depre&s;&s;ed party were of con&s;equence timorous and uncon|nected, as if already humbled by their impe|rious ma&s;ters. Gracchus, who ea&s;ily fore&s;aw his weakne&s;s, was however re&s;olved not to abandon his friends, though he knew them to be unable to re&s;i&s;t his opponents. Notwith&s;tand|ing, he refu&s;ed to go armed as the re&s;t, but taking his u&s;ual robe, and a &s;hort dagger for his defence, in ca&s;e of being attacked, he pre|pared to lead his followers to Mount Aventine. It was there he learned, that proclamation had
<PB N="327" REF="338">
been made by the con&s;uls, that whoever &s;hould bring either his head, or that of Flaccus, &s;hould receive its weight in gold for the reward. It was to no purpo&s;e, that he &s;ent the younge&s;t &s;on of Flaccus, who was yet a child, with pro|po&s;als for an accommodation. The &s;enate and the con&s;uls, who were &s;en&s;ible of their &s;uperi|ority, rejected all his offers, and re&s;olved to puni&s;h his offence with nothing le&s;s than his death; and in order to weaken his party, they offered pardon to all who &s;hould leave him im|mediately. This produced the de&s;ired effect, the people fell from him by degrees, and left him with very inferior forces. He now therefore, re&s;olved to wait upon the &s;enate in per&s;on, but his friends would not permit him, through an apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing their com|mander. The child of Flaccus was there|fore &s;ent once more to demand peace; but Opi|mius the con&s;ul, who thir&s;ted for &s;laughter, or|dered it to pri&s;on, and leading his forces up to Mount Aventine, fell in among the crowd with ungovernable fury. A terrible &s;laughter of the &s;carce re&s;i&s;ting multitude en&s;ued, not le&s;s than three thou&s;and citizens were &s;lain upon the &s;pot. Flaccus attempted to find &s;helter in a ru|inous cottage, but being di&s;covered, was &s;lain, with his elde&s;t &s;on. Gracchus, at fir&s;t, retired to the temple of Diana, where he was re&s;olved to die by his own hand, but was prevented by two
<PB N="328" REF="339">
of his faithful friends and followers, Pompo|nius and Licinius, who forced him to &s;eek &s;afety by flight. From thence he made the be&s;t of his way in order to cro&s;s a bridge, that led from the city, &s;till attended by his two generous friends, and a Grecian &s;lave, who&s;e name was Philocrates. But his pur&s;uers &s;till pre&s;&s;ed upon him from behind, and when come to the foot of the bridge, he was obliged to turn and face the enemy. His two friends were &s;oon &s;lain, defending him again&s;t the crowd, and he forced with his &s;lave into a grove beyond the Tyber, which had long been dedicated to the Furies. Here finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded on every &s;ide, and no way left of e&s;caping, he pre|vailed upon his &s;lave to kill him, who immedi|ately after killed him&s;elf, and fell down dead upon the body of his beloved ma&s;ter. The pur&s;uers &s;oon coming up, cut off the head of Gracchus, and placed it for a while as a trophy, upon a &s;pear. Soon after, one Septimuleius carrying it home, fir&s;t having &s;ecretly taken out the brain, filled it with lead, in order to make it weigh the heavier, and thus received of the con&s;ul &s;even|teen pounds of gold as his recompence.</P>
<P>Thus died Caius Gracchus, about ten years after his brother Tiberius, and &s;ix after he began to be active in the commonwealth. He is u&s;ually impeached by hi&s;torians, as guilty of &s;edition, but from what we &s;ee of his character,
<PB N="329" REF="340">
the di&s;turbance of public tranquility, was rather owing to his oppo&s;ers, than to him, &s;o that in|&s;tead of calling the tumults of that time, the &s;edition of the Gracchi, we &s;hould rather call them the &s;edition of the &s;enate again&s;t the Grac|chi, &s;ince the efforts of the latter were made in vindication of a law, to which the &s;enate had a&s;&s;ented, and as the former were &s;upported by a foreign armed power, that had never before meddled in the bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation, and who&s;e introduction at that time, gave a mo&s;t ir|recoverable blow to the con&s;titution. Whether the Gracchi were actuated by motives of ambi|tion or of patrioti&s;m, in the promulgation of the&s;e laws, it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine, but certain it is from what appears, that all ju&s;tice was on their &s;ide, and all injury on that of the &s;enate. In fact, this body was now quite changed from that venerable a&s;&s;embly, which we have &s;een overthrowing Pyrrhus and Hannibal, as much by their virtues, as their arms. They were now only to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the people by their &s;uperior luxuries, and ruled the commonwealth by the weight of that authority, which is gained from riches, and a number of mercenary dependancies. All the venal and the ba&s;e were attached to them from motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t, and they who &s;till ven|tured to be independant, were borne down, and entirely lo&s;t in the infamous majority. In &s;hort,
<PB N="330" REF="341">
the empire, at this period, came under the go|vernment of an hateful ari&s;tocracy; the tri|bunes, who were formerly accounted protectors of the people, becoming rich them&s;elves, and having no longer oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of the &s;enate, concurred in their oppre&s;&s;ions, &s;ince, as has been &s;aid, it was not now the &s;truggle be|tween patricians and plebeians, who only nomi|nally differed, but between the rich and the poor. The lower orders of the &s;tate being by the&s;e means reduced to a degree of hopele&s;s &s;ubjec|tion, in&s;tead of looking after liberty, only &s;ought for a leader; while the rich, with all the &s;u&s;picion of tyrants, terrified at the &s;lighte&s;t ap|pearance of oppo&s;ition, entru&s;ted men with un|controulable power, from whom they had not &s;trength to withdraw it, when the danger was over. Thus both parts of the &s;tate concurred in giving up their freedom; the fears of the &s;enate fir&s;t made the dictator, and the hatred of the people kept him in his office.

The Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aric I&s;lands were &s;ubdued.

Jug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ha was grand&s;on to the famous Ma&s;&s;i|ni&s;&s;a, who &s;ided again&s;t Hannibal with Rome. He was educated with the two young princes, who were left to inherit the kingdom, and be|ing &s;uperior in abilities to both, and greatly in favour with the people, he murdered Hiemp&s;al, the elde&s;t &s;on, and attempted the &s;ame by Ad|herbal the younger, who made his e&s;cape, and fled to the Romans for &s;uccour. Whereupon, Jugurtha being &s;en&s;ible how much avarice and inju&s;tice had crept into the &s;enate, &s;ent his am|ba&s;&s;adors with large pre&s;ents to Rome, who &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully prevailed, that the &s;enate decreed him half the kingdom, which he had thus acquired by murder and u&s;urpation, and &s;ent ten commi&s;|&s;ioners to divide it between him and Adherbal. The commi&s;&s;ioners, of whom Opimius the mur|derer of Gracchus was one, willing to follow the example which the &s;enate had &s;et them, were al&s;o bribed to be&s;tow the mo&s;t rich and populous part of the kingdom upon the u&s;urper, who however re&s;olved to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the whole. But willing to give a colour to his ambition, he only made in the beginning incur&s;ions upon his colleague's territories, in order to provoke re|pri&s;als, which he knew how to convert into &s;eem|ing aggre&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e it came before the &s;enate. This however failing, he re&s;olved to throw off the ma&s;k, and be&s;ieging Adherbal in Cirta, his capital, he at length got him into his power and
<PB N="333" REF="344">
murdered him. The people of Rome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ho had &s;till &s;ome genero&s;ity remaining, unanimou&s;ly complained of this treachery; the &s;enate only, who had been bribed to &s;ilence, continued for a while in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. However, a con&s;ul was &s;ent, at la&s;t, with a powerful army, to oppo&s;e him, but he being al&s;o infected with the avarice of the times, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be bribed, and &s;u&s;pending his operations, made overtures for peace. The people therefore, now more enraged than before, procured a decree, that Jugurtha &s;hould be &s;um|moned in per&s;on before them, upon the public faith of the &s;tate, in order to give an account of all &s;uch as had accepted bribes. Jugurtha made no great difficulty in throwing him&s;elf upon the clemency of Rome, and &s;oon after appeared before the people in an imploring manner, and in a dre&s;s corre&s;ponding with his &s;ituation. However, in&s;tead of di&s;covering tho&s;e who were bribed, he only &s;et about renewing the evil complained of, and being &s;en&s;ible, that all opi|nions were venal at Rome, without much en|deavouring to influence any by the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, he took the more certain method of intere&s;ting them, by the di&s;tribution of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is riches. Wherefore, when brought to be ex|amined by the people, concerning his unju&s;t method of obtaining the protection of the ma|gi&s;trates, who were &s;ent to oppo&s;e him, Bebius, one of the tribunes, who had been him&s;elf cor|rupted,

His avarice induced him to lay &s;iege to Suthul, a place al|mo&s;t impregnable by nature, and only inviting the enemy, becau&s;e it contained the trea&s;ure of the king. Jugurtha, con&s;cious of the &s;trength of the place, &s;uffered Aulus to amu&s;e him&s;elf before it, and at one time pretending fear, at another, offering terms of accommodation, but &s;till lavi&s;hing his bribes even to the meane&s;t centurion, he led his antagoni&s;t into &s;uch &s;traits, that he was compelled to hazard a battle upon di&s;advantageous terms, and his whole army, to avoid being cut to pieces, was obliged to pa&s;s under the yoke. In this condition, Metellus, the &s;ucceeding con&s;ul, found affairs, upon his arrival in Numidia. Officers without confidence, an army without di&s;cipline, and an enemy ever watchful, and ever intriguing. However, by his great attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and by an integrity, that &s;huddered at corruption, he &s;oon began to retrieve the affairs of Rome, and the credit of the army. In the &s;pace of two years, Jugurtha was overthrown in &s;everal battles, forced out of his own dominions, and con&s;trained to beg a peace. This, Metellus offered to grant, upon condition, that he &s;hould fir&s;t deliver up his elephants and arms. With this the Numidian prince complied, and they were delivered up
<PB N="336" REF="347">
accordingly. He was then commanded to pay two hundred thou&s;and pound weight of &s;ilver to defray the war: this was immediately paid down. The de&s;erters were next ordered to be given up: this too was complied with. At length, the Roman general in&s;i&s;ted, that Jugur|tha &s;hould come and &s;urrender in per&s;on, and put him&s;elf upon his trial at Rome. With this he refu&s;ed to comply, and thus the treaty be|ing broken, both &s;ides re&s;olved once more to tempt the hazards of the war. All things how|ever, promi&s;ed Metellus an ea&s;y and a certain victory; the enemy was almo&s;t entirely &s;ubdued; few cities remained that could make re&s;i&s;tance, and all the wiles of the Numidian were exhau&s;ted with his trea&s;ures. It only remained, towards concluding the war in triumph, that Metellus &s;hould be cho&s;en con&s;ul once more, but in this he was di&s;appointed, and another general came in, to reap that harve&s;t of glory which his indu&s;try had &s;own. This was Caius Marius, who had been &s;ent with him as his lieutenant in the war. This commander, who became afterwards the glory and the &s;courge of Rome, was born in a village near Arpinium, of poor parents, who gained their living by their labour. As he had been bred up in a participation of their toils, his manners were as rude, as his countenance was frightful. He was a man of extraordinary &s;tature, incomparable &s;trength, and undaunted
<PB N="337" REF="348">
bravery. He entered early into the &s;ervice of his country, and was, from the beginning, re|markable for his exact ob&s;ervance of di&s;cipline, and his implicit obedience to tho&s;e in command. He &s;ought upon every occa&s;ion, dangers equal to his courage; the longe&s;t marches, and the mo&s;t painful fatigues of war, were ea&s;y to one bred up in penury and labour. He was not more aver&s;e to the allurements of plea&s;ure, from habit, than by nature. He took all occa&s;ions to in&s;pire temperance by his example; eat the &s;ame bread which was di&s;tributed to the meane&s;t centinel; lay upon the ground; dre&s;&s;ed in the coar&s;e&s;t garments, and &s;eemed dead to every other pa&s;&s;ion, but that of ambition and re|venge. He had already pa&s;&s;ed through the meaner gradations of office, and each &s;eemed conferred on him, as the reward of &s;ome &s;ignal exploit. When he &s;tood for the office of mili|tary tribune, though his per&s;on was unknown, his actions were in the mouths of the multi|tude. When elected to that charge, his gene|ral found his merit and a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o great, that he &s;econded him with his intere&s;t, in procuring him to be made a tribune of the people. It was in this &s;tation, that his ambition began to appear, and his thorough dete&s;tation of the &s;e|nate, who&s;e vices indeed de&s;erved his reproaches, became con&s;picuous. Not to be intimidated by their threats, he boldly arraigned their corruption
<PB N="338" REF="349">
even in the &s;enate-hou&s;e, and when Metellus, who till then had patronized and rai&s;ed him, di&s;|approved his zeal, he even threatened to commit him to pri&s;on. However, being afterwards &s;ent under him as his lieutenant into Numidia, Me|tellus preferred the intere&s;t of his country to pri|vate re&s;entment, and tru&s;ted Marius with the mo&s;t important concerns of the war. This confidence was not mi&s;placed, Marius acquitted him&s;elf in every action with &s;uch prudence and re&s;olution, that he was con&s;idered at Rome, as &s;econd in com|mand, but fir&s;t in experience and re&s;olution. It was in this &s;ituation of affairs, that Metellus, as has been &s;aid, was obliged to &s;ollicit at Rome for a continuation of his command; but Ma|rius, who&s;e ambition knew no bounds, was re|&s;olved to obtain it for him&s;elf, and thus gain all the glory of putting an end to the war. To that end he privately inveighed again&s;t Metel|lus by his emi&s;&s;aries at Rome. He in&s;inuated among the people, that the war was prolonged, only to lengthen out the con&s;ul's command, and a&s;&s;erted, that he was able, with half the army, to make Jugurtha a pri&s;oner; engaging al&s;o, in a &s;ingle campaign, to bring him dead or alive to Rome. By &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, having excited a &s;pirit of di&s;content again&s;t Metellus, he had leave granted him to go to Rome, to &s;tand for the con&s;ul&s;hip him&s;elf,
<PB N="339" REF="350">
which he obtained, contrary to the expectation and intere&s;t of the nobles.</P>
<P>Marius being thus inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme power of managing the war, &s;hewed him&s;elf every way fit for the commi&s;&s;ion. His vigi|lance was equal to his valour, and he quickly made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the cities which Ju|gurtha had yet remaining in Numidia. This unfortunate prince finding him&s;elf unable to make oppo&s;ition &s;ingly, was obliged to have recour&s;e for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to Bocchus, king of Mau|ritania, to who&s;e daughter he was married. A battle &s;oon after en&s;ued, in which the Numi|dians &s;urprized the Roman camp by night, and gained a temporary advantage. However, it was but of &s;hort continuance, for Marius &s;oon after overthrew them in two &s;ignal engage|ments, in one of which, not le&s;s than ninety thou&s;and of the African army were &s;lain. Boc|chus now finding the Romans too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted, did not think it expedient to haz|ard his own crown, to protect that of his ally; he therefore determined to make peace, upon whatever conditions he might obtain it, and accordingly &s;ent to Rome, imploring its pro|tection and friend&s;hip. The &s;enate received the amba&s;&s;adors with their u&s;ual haughtine&s;s, and without complying with their reque&s;t, granted the &s;uppliants, not their friend&s;hip but their pardon. However, they were
<PB N="340" REF="351">
given to under&s;tand, that the delivering up of Jugurtha to the Romans, would in &s;ome mea&s;ure conciliate their favour, and &s;often their re&s;ent|ment. At fir&s;t the pride of Bocchus &s;truggled again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;al, but a few interviews with Sylla, who was quae&s;tor to Marius, reconciled him to this treacherous mea&s;ure. At length therefore, Jugurtha was given up, being drawn into an ambu&s;cade, by the &s;pecious pretences of his ally, who deluded him by de&s;iring a con|ference, and he was brought over by Marius to Rome. He did not long &s;urvive his overthrow, being condemned by the &s;enate to be &s;tarved to death in pri&s;on, a &s;hort time after he had adorned the triumph of the conqueror. His own cruelty, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, de&s;erved this fate, but they mu&s;t be doubly cruel, who could thus oblige a pri&s;oner, whom they re&s;olved to put to death, to encrea&s;e the &s;plendor of a proce&s;&s;ion, and thus find delight in his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This victory over Jugurtha had been &s;carce obtained, when news was brought to Rome, that immen&s;e numbers of barbarians from the north, were pouring down into the Roman do|minions, and were threatening Italy it&s;elf with &s;laughter and de&s;olation. Marius was now looked upon as the only per&s;on who could op|po&s;e them, and he was accordingly made con&s;ul a &s;econd time, contray to the con&s;titutions of the &s;tate, which required an interval of ten years
<PB N="341" REF="352">
between each con&s;ul&s;hip. The people he was to oppo&s;e, were the Cimbri and Teutones, who left their fore&s;ts, to the number of three hundred thou&s;and men, in order to &s;eek new habitations in the fruitful vallies of Italy. They had, &s;ome time before, invaded Gaul, where they had committed great ravages, and defeated many Roman armies that were &s;ent again&s;t them. Marius however, was entirely &s;ucce&s;sful. He at fir&s;t declined fighting, till their force was weakened by delay, but afterwards engaging <MILESTONE N="650,"> them as they were pa&s;&s;ing the Alps, in three &s;eperate bodies, a bloody battle en&s;ued, which la&s;ted two days. In this the Romans were vic|torious, and Theutobocchus, the king of the Teutones, taken pri&s;oner, with the lo&s;s of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and men. But though the Teutones were thus utterly de&s;troyed, the army of the Cimbri &s;till remained entire, and had actually pa&s;t the Alps, after having put Catulus, the Roman con&s;ul to flight. Marius however, being made con&s;ul a fifth time (for the people had continued him in office during the former part of the war) met and gave them a <MILESTONE N="653"> dreadful overthrow. An hundred and forty thou&s;and of the&s;e barbarians were &s;lain, and &s;ixty thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners. Their wives, during the engagement, fought furiou&s;ly in chariots, and at la&s;t, when they &s;aw the fortune of the field
<PB N="342" REF="353">
decided, &s;lew their children, and then with de&s;perate intrepidity, de&s;troyed each other.</P>
<P>Marius, by the&s;e victories, having become very formidable to di&s;tant nations in war, be|came &s;oon after much more dangerous to his fellow citizens in peace. Metellus, from being his fir&s;t patron and promoter, was long grown hateful to him, for his &s;uperior influence in the &s;enate, &s;o that he earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to have him bani&s;hed from Rome. To effect this, he em|ployed one Saturninus, who had unju&s;tly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the tribune&s;hip, to prefer a law for the partition of &s;uch lands as had been recovered in the late war, and to oblige the &s;e|nators to take a &s;olemn oath for putting it into execution, in ca&s;e it was pa&s;t. The law was &s;oon enacted by the intere&s;t of Marius, but when the &s;enate came to confirm the ob&s;ervance of it, Metellus, who con&s;idered it as a renewal of the ancient di&s;turbances that had been &s;o fatal to the con&s;titution, endeavoured to per&s;uade them to reject the mea&s;ure with di&s;dain. At fir&s;t they &s;eemed inclined to come into his advice, but the influence of his rival being &s;uperior, they were content to &s;wear, and Metellus refu&s;ing, was ob|liged to go into voluntary exile. He was re|ceived with great re&s;pect by all the cities through which he pa&s;&s;ed, and taking up his re&s;idence in the I&s;land of Rhodes, he there &s;eemed to forget that he was great, and only &s;tudied to be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="354">
This &s;ucce&s;s only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the arro|gance of Saturninus. Being made tribune a third time, he filled the city with clamour and and commotion. Memmius, who was of the oppo&s;ite party, was killed in one of the&s;e frays, as he canva&s;&s;ed for the con&s;ul&s;hip, and Glaucius the praetor, was tumultuou&s;ly cho&s;en in his &s;tead. This &s;eemed as a &s;ignal for a general encounter. The &s;enate &s;eemed re&s;olved to curb the in&s;olence of the tribunes: the con&s;uls were ordered, as in dangerous times, to provide for the &s;afety of the commonwealth, and Marius, who was one of them, found him&s;elf in the di&s;a|greeable &s;ituation, of heading a &s;trong body of the &s;enators and patricians, again&s;t tho&s;e very people, whom his own intrigues had put into commotion. Saturninus and his followers were forced into the capitol, where for want of wa|ter, they were compelled to yield, after Marius had pa&s;&s;ed his word for their &s;afety. But he was now unable to protect them, a large body of Roman knights broke into the Forum, and cut them to pieces, while the prevailing party, elate with their &s;ucce&s;s, recalled Metellus from exile.</P>
<P>Marius being thus doubly mortified by the demolition of his party, and the revocation of his rival, left Rome, under pretence of per|forming a vow, but in reality, with hopes of kindling up new wars in A&s;ia, in which only, his military talents could have room for di&s;play.
<PB N="344" REF="355">
With this view, he went to the court of Mithri|dates, at that time the mo&s;t powerful monarch of the Ea&s;t, hoping either to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;corn, or received with ho&s;pitality. In either ca&s;e he expected to find his account, if di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, it would give a colour for declaring war again&s;t him; if received, he would be in a better con|dition to judge of the &s;trength of his enemy. Mithridates received him with great kindne&s;s, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him loaden with pre&s;ents to Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the &s;trength which Ma|rius had given the popular party, was not to be de&s;troyed by a &s;ingle blow: Dru&s;us the tribune, whom we have &s;een oppo&s;ing the popularity of Gracchus, &s;eemed now determined to pur&s;ue his example. This well-meaning man finding the &s;enators di&s;plea&s;ed with the judicial power which had been con&s;igned over to the knights, and per|ceiving the latter al&s;o making a very tyrannical u&s;e of their authority, he conceived a de&s;ign of conciliating both, by re&s;toring the &s;enate to its ancient privileges, and rai&s;ing a large number of the eque&s;trian order into that body. How|ever, what he expected would plea&s;e both, was di&s;liked by all: the &s;enate was again&s;t having their number enlarged; the knights were aver&s;e to lo&s;ing their privileges, and the people were di&s;plea&s;ed at having the law of Gracchus brought into danger. In order therefore to
<PB N="345" REF="356">
gain that popularity which he found he had lo&s;t by this mea&s;ure, he once again threatened the great with the revival of the Licinian law; and that the allies and confederates of Italy, who were the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, might &s;hare an equivalent, to what this law was likely to deprive them of, he gave them hopes of being admit|ted to the freedom of Rome. The&s;e promi|&s;es did not fail to produce their effect; the Latin towns now began to look upon him as their protector, and came in va&s;t crowds to the city, to &s;upport him. Great contentions aro&s;e in con&s;equence of his endeavours. De|liberation had now been long bani&s;hed from the a&s;&s;emblies of the people; the whole of their laws were enacted or rejected by clamour, violence and &s;edition. On one of the&s;e occa|&s;ions, Dru&s;us being warmly engaged in promot|ing the law for enlarging the freedom of the city, he was &s;tabbed by an unknown per&s;on, who left his poignard in the wound: Dru&s;us had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to avow with his dying breath, the integrity of his intentions, and that there was no man in the commonwealth, more &s;in|ecrely attached to its intere&s;ts than he.</P>
<P>The Italians being thus fru&s;trated in their aims of gaining the freedom of Rome, by the death of Dru&s;us, re&s;olved upon obtaining by force, what the &s;enate &s;eemed to refu&s;e them as a favour. This gave ri&s;e to the Social war,
<PB N="346" REF="357">
in which mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Italy entered into a confederacy again&s;t Rome, in order to obtain a redre&s;s of this, and all the re&s;t of their grievances. Me&s;&s;engers and ho&s;tages were pri|vately &s;ent and interchanged among&s;t them, and upon having their claims rejected by the &s;enate, they &s;oon broke out into open rebellion. The &s;tate now &s;aw an hundred thou&s;and of its own &s;oldiers converted again&s;t it&s;elf, led on by excellent commanders, and di&s;ciplined in the Roman manner. To oppo&s;e the&s;e, an equal body was rai&s;ed by the &s;enate, and the con|duct of the war committed to the con&s;uls, together with Marius, Sylla, and the mo&s;t experienced generals of the time. The war commenced with great animo&s;ity on either &s;ide, but the Romans &s;eemed to have the wor&s;t of it in the beginning. Rutilius the con&s;ul fell into an ambu&s;cade, and was &s;lain. His body be|ing carried into the city, &s;o di&s;couraged the peo|ple, that the &s;enate decreed, that thenceforward the bodies of the &s;lain &s;hould be buried where they fell. Upon this defeat, the army which he conducted was given to Marius, who rather might be &s;aid, not to forfeit his ancient fame, than to acquire new reputation by his conduct during the pre&s;ent command.</P>
<P>After a lap&s;e of two years, this war having continued to rage with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;enate began to reflect, that whether conquere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="347" REF="358">
or conquerors, the power of Rome was in dan|ger of being totally de&s;troyed. In order there|fore to &s;often their compliance by degrees, they began by giving the freedom of the city to &s;uch of the Italian &s;tates as had not revolted. They then offered it to &s;uch as would &s;oone&s;t lay down their arms. This unexpected bounty had the de&s;ired effect; the allies, with mutual di&s;tru&s;t, offered each a &s;eparate treaty: the &s;e|nate took them one by one into favour, but gave the freedom of the city in &s;uch a manner, that being empowered to vote, not untill all the other tribes had given their &s;uffrages, they had very little weight in the con&s;titution. In this manner they were made free, all but the Sam|nites and Lucanians, who &s;eemed excluded from the general compromi&s;e, as if to leave Sylla, who commanded again&s;t them, the glory of putting an end to the war: this he performed with great conduct, &s;torming their camps, over|throwing them in &s;everal battles, and obliging them to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms as the &s;enate were plea&s;ed to impo&s;e.</P>
<P>This de&s;tructive war being concluded, which as Paterculus &s;ays, con&s;umed above three hun|dred thou&s;and of the flower of Italy, the &s;enate now began to think of turning their arms again&s;t Mithridates, the mo&s;t powerful and warlike monarch of the Ea&s;t. This prince, who&s;e dominions were chiefly compo&s;ed of the
<PB N="348" REF="359">
provinces he had conquered, was ma&s;ter of Cappadocia, Bythinia, Thrace, Macedon, and all Greece. He was able to bring two hundred and fifty thou&s;and infantry, into the field, and fifty thou&s;and hor&s;e. He had a va&s;t number of armed chariots, and in his ports, four hundred &s;hips of war. Such power joined to &s;o great riches, &s;erved only the more to invite the am|bition of Rome: they but de&s;ired a pretence for a war, which was not long wanting. The pretext was his having invaded and overcome many &s;tates that were in alliance with, and un|der the protection of Rome: his having pro|cured Tigranes, king of Armenia, to declare war again&s;t the Romans, together with his continually upbraiding the Roman &s;tate with avarice and corruption. Such were the motives that induced them to declare war again&s;t this king, it only remained to chu&s;e a general, pro|perly qualified to conduct the expedition.</P>
<P>Marius was the mo&s;t experienced comman|der, and ardently wi&s;hed to go: but Sylla was ju&s;t cho&s;en con&s;ul, and had obtained this dig|nity, as a recompence for his &s;ervices in the Social war: his fame now therefore began to equal that of Marius, and he was with general con&s;ent appointed to conduct the A&s;iatic war. This general, who now began to take the lead in the commonwealth, was born of a patrician family, one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious in Rome:
<PB N="349" REF="360">
his per&s;on was elegant, his air noble, his man|ners ea&s;y, and apparently &s;incere: he loved plea&s;ure, but glory &s;till more: his duty &s;till commanded him from &s;en&s;ual delights, which however, he never declined, when he could en|joy them with &s;afety: he de&s;ired to plea&s;e all the world, for which purpo&s;e, he talked of him&s;elf with mode&s;ty, and of every body el&s;e with the highe&s;t commendations: he was liberal to all, and even prevented tho&s;e reque&s;ts, which mode&s;ty he&s;itated to make: &s;tooping, even to an acquaintance with the meane&s;t &s;oldiers, who&s;e manners he &s;ometimes imitated, to gain their affections. In &s;hort, he was a Proteus, who could adapt him&s;elf to the inclinations, pur|&s;uits, follies, or the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e he con|ver&s;ed with, while he had no character of his own, except that of being a complete di&s;&s;em|bler. His fir&s;t ri&s;e was to be quae&s;tor or trea|&s;urer of the army under Marius in Numidia, where by his courage and dexterity, he contri|buted greatly to obtain tho&s;e advantages which en&s;ued, and it was he particularly, who per|&s;uaded Bocchus to give up Jugurtha. He was afterwards cho&s;en procon&s;ul in the Social war, where his actions entirely eclip&s;ed tho&s;e of every other commander, and he was in con&s;equence of them, now appointed to the government of A&s;ia Minor, a po&s;t, which as it promi&s;ed an
<PB N="350" REF="361">
immen&s;e harve&s;t of glory and riches, was ear|ne&s;tly &s;ought after by Marius.</P>
<P>There were two incentives to the jealou&s;y of Marius, at finding Sylla thus preferred to con|duct this war before him. The honours which were likely to be obtained there, and the for|mer pains he had taken to prepare him&s;elf for that expedition. He therefore began to con&s;ider this preference as an unju&s;t partiality in favour of his rival, and a tacit in&s;ult upon all his for|mer victories. He could not help thinking, that his reputation de&s;erved the fir&s;t offer in all the employments of the &s;tate, and he concluded upon depriving Sylla of his new command. To this end, he gained over to his intere&s;t, one Sulpicius, a tribune of the people, but chiefly noted for his enmity to Sylla; a man equally eloquent and bold, of great riches but corrupt manners, and rather dreaded than e&s;teemed by the people. The fir&s;t effect of the conjunc|tion of the&s;e ambitious men, was to gain over the Italian towns to their party, and for this purpo&s;e they preferred a law, that the&s;e &s;hould vote, not in the rear of the other tribes, but that they &s;hould be indi&s;criminately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the &s;ame advantages. This law was as warmly op|po&s;ed by the citizens of Rome, as it was re&s;o|lutely defended by Marius and Sulpicius, and the &s;tates of Italy. A tumult en&s;ued as u&s;ual, in which many were &s;lain on one &s;ide and the other. This
<PB N="351" REF="362">
had been &s;carcely appea&s;ed, when another a&s;|&s;embly of the people was propo&s;ed, for pa&s;&s;ing the law, contrary to the command of the con|&s;uls. This produced a more violent commotion than even the former, in which Sylla's &s;on-in-law, who attempted to oppo&s;e the law, was &s;lain: nor was Sylla him&s;elf in le&s;s danger, for being pur&s;ued by the multitude, he was at la&s;t obliged to take refuge in the hou&s;e of his ene|my Marius, who though naturally vindictive, would not break the laws of ho&s;pitality, which were &s;till reverenced in Rome. Having thus found means of e&s;caping their fury, and finding the oppo&s;ite faction prevail, he in&s;tantly quit|ted Rome, and went to the army which he had commanded during the Social war, and which was appointed to go under him upon the ex|pedition into A&s;ia. In the mean time, Marius and Sulpicius drove their &s;cheme forward with|out any oppo&s;ition; the law for giving the Ita|lians a full participation of the freedom of the city, was pa&s;t without trouble; and by the &s;ame law it was enacted, that the command of the army which was to oppo&s;e Mithridates, was to be transferred from Sylla to Marius.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, Marius immediately &s;ent down officers from Rome, to take com|mand in his name. But Sylla, as was mention|ed above, had predi&s;po&s;ed the army in his own favour. They were troops with whom he had
<PB N="352" REF="363">
gained &s;ignal victories, and they were entirely devoted to his command. In&s;tead therefore, of obeying the orders of Marius, they fell up|on and &s;lew his officers, and then entreated their general, that he would lead them directly to take &s;ignal vengeance upon all his enemies at Rome. In the mean time, Marius being in|formed of this, was not &s;low in making repri|&s;als upon &s;uch of Sylla's friends as fell into his hands in the city. This produced new mur|murs in Sylla's camp, the army in&s;i&s;ted upon being led to the capital, and their general him|&s;elf, who was naturally vindictive, at length determined to comply.</P>
<P>Sylla's army amounted to &s;ix legions, the &s;oldiers of which &s;eemed animated with the re|&s;entment of their leader, and breathed nothing but &s;laughter and revenge. However, there were a few yet remaining among them, that even in this time of general corruption, could not think of turning their arms upon their na|tive city, but quitted the camp and fled. Thus a &s;trange migration of different parties was &s;een, &s;ome flying from Rome to avoid the re|&s;entment of Marius, and others de&s;erting from the camp, not to be accomplices in the guilt of Sylla. Still however, the army ad|vanced toward Rome; it was to no purpo&s;e, that the praetors went out from the city in form, to retard them; they broke the en&s;igns
<PB N="353" REF="364">
of their office, and tore their purple robes with deri&s;ion. The &s;enate next &s;ent deputies to com|mand the army not to advance within five miles of the city. The deputies were for a while amu&s;|ed by Sylla, however they &s;eemed &s;carce returned to give an account of their commi&s;&s;ion, when he arrived with all his forces at the very gates of Rome. His &s;oldiers entered the city &s;word in hand, as into a place taken by &s;torm. Ma|rius and Sulpicius, at the head of a tumultu|ary body of their partizans, attempted to op|po&s;e their entrance, and the citizens them&s;elves, who feared the &s;accage of the place, threw down &s;tones and tyles from the tops of the hou&s;es upon the &s;oldiers. So unequal a con|flict la&s;ted longer than could have been expect|ed, but at length, Marius and his party were obliged to &s;eek &s;afety by flight, after having vainly offered liberty to all the &s;laves, who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this emergency.</P>
<P>Sylla now finding him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city, placed bodies of &s;oldiers in different parts to prevent pillage and di&s;order. He even pu|ni&s;hed &s;ome &s;everely for offering to enter the hou&s;es by force, and &s;pent the night in vi&s;iting their quarters, and re&s;training their impetuo&s;ity. The next morning he began, by modelling the laws &s;o as to favour his outrages. The&s;e had long lo&s;t their force in the commonwealth, and were now molded into whatever form the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="354" REF="365">
party were plea&s;ed they &s;hould a&s;&s;ume. He therefore rever&s;ed all the decrees which had been pa&s;&s;ed by Sulpicius. He enacted, that no law &s;hould be propo&s;ed for the future, but what &s;hould be previou&s;ly approved by the &s;e|nate. That the &s;uffrages &s;hould be given by cla&s;&s;es, in which the patricians were &s;ure of a majority, and not by tribes, in which, every man having an equal voice, the influence of the great was totally annihilated. To the&s;e he ad|ded a decree, whereby Marius, Sulpicius, and ten other leading men were declared enemies to their country, and by which it was lawful for any per&s;on to kill them. Having thus brought the laws to &s;econd his ambition, he cau&s;ed the goods of the pro&s;cribed to be confi&s;cated, and next &s;ent troops into all parts to apprehend them. Marius e&s;caped, but Sulpicius was found hidden in the mar&s;hes of Laurentium, and his head be|ing cut off, was carried and fixed upon the Ro&s;|trum at Rome. Sylla having thus, as he &s;uppo&s;|ed, entirely re&s;tored peace to the city, departed upon his expedition again&s;t Mithridates, hop|ing to give new vigour to his de&s;igns, by the wealth and honours which he expected to reap in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>But while Sylla was thus e&s;tabli&s;hing his par|ty again&s;t Marius, he had been inattentive to a very formidable opponent, who was daily grow|ing into popularity and power at Rome. This
<PB N="355" REF="366">
was Cornelius Cinna, who was born of a pa|trician family, but &s;trongly attached to the peo|ple from motives of ambition. He was a man eager after glory, but incapable of patiently ex|pecting its regular approach: ra&s;h, hot, and ob&s;tinate, but at the &s;ame time, bold, and cou|rageous; he was willing to become the leader of the people, as he could not lead in the &s;e|nate. He therefore offered him&s;elf for the con|&s;ul&s;hip, in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;ts of Sylla, and either from that general's inattention to one he de&s;pi&s;ed, or from his own great favour with the lower part of the people, he obtained it. He was &s;carce inve&s;ted with his new dignity, but his enmity broke forth: he boa&s;ted, that he would annul all the laws which had been lately made in favour of the patricians, and ac|cordingly began by endeavours to attach the Italians firmly to his intere&s;t. This was only to be effected, by giving them an equal parti|cipation in the freedom of the city, of which Sylla had lately deprived them. He therefore &s;ent private emi&s;&s;aries among the country &s;tates, de&s;iring their attendance at Rome upon a cer|tain day, and enjoining them al&s;o to carry &s;words under their robes. Thus, when he had prepared a party to &s;upport his preten&s;ions, he publickly propo&s;ed the law for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the new Italian tribes, and for giving them equal privileges with the re&s;t, by mixing them among
<PB N="356" REF="367">
tho&s;e formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed. To propo&s;e a law at this time, was in &s;ome meau&s;ure to de|clare a war. An engagement en&s;ued, in which the Italians, being previou&s;ly armed, came off victorious for a while; but Octavius, the other con&s;ul, coming with a powerful body of Sylla's friends to oppo&s;e them, &s;oon turned the fortune of the day, and obliged the Italians to quit the city.</P>
<P>Cinna being thus defeated in his purpo&s;e of pa&s;&s;ing the law, had notwith&s;tanding, the plea|&s;ure of finding all the &s;tates of Italy &s;trongly united in his favour; whereupon, leaving Rome, he went from city to city, declaring again&s;t the tyranny of the great, and their in|ju&s;tice to their allies, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had become &s;o powerful: he allured them with fre&s;h hopes of equal privileges with the Ro|mans, and excited their pity towards him&s;elf, who&s;e &s;ufferings had been incurred for his a&s;&s;i|duity in their cau&s;e. Having thus induced them to a general in&s;urrection, he began to make levies both of troops and money: thus a powerful army was &s;oon rai&s;ed, and Cinna, as being con&s;ul of Rome, without oppo&s;ition, was placed at its head. In the mean time, the &s;enate, who were apprized of the&s;e violent pro|ceedings, went through the forms of ju&s;tice again&s;t him. Being &s;ummoned to take his trial, and not appearing, he was degraded from his
<PB N="357" REF="368">
rank as a citizen, tured out of his office of con&s;ul, and Lucius Merula, the prie&s;t of Ju|piter, elected in his &s;tead. But the&s;e indig|nities only &s;erved to encrea&s;e his diligence and animo&s;ity. He appeared before a body of the Roman forces that were encamped at Capua, in an humble, imploring manner, without any of the en&s;igns of his office. He entreated them with tears and prote&s;tations, not to &s;uffer the people of Rome to fall a &s;acrifice to the tyranny of the great: he invoked the gods who puni&s;hed inju&s;tice, to witne&s;s to the rectitude of his intentions, and &s;o far prevailed upon the &s;oldiers, that they unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved to &s;upport his cau&s;e. The whole army, with general con&s;ent, agreed to nominate him con&s;ul, and contrary to the decree of the &s;enate, inve&s;ted him with the en&s;igns of his office: and then taking the oaths of allegiance, they deter|mined to follow him to Rome. Thus he &s;aw his &s;trength encrea&s;ing every day; &s;everal of the &s;enators who were wavering before, now came over to his &s;ide; but what was equal to an army in it&s;elf! Tidings were brought, that Marius e&s;caping from a thou&s;and perils, was with his &s;on upon the road to join him.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een this formidable general driven out of Rome, and declared a public enemy: we have &s;een him at the age of &s;eventy, after numberle&s;s victories, and &s;ix con&s;ul&s;hips,
<PB N="358" REF="369">
obliged to &s;ave him&s;elf, unattended and on foot, from the numerous pur&s;uits of tho&s;e who &s;ought his life. After having wandered for &s;ome time in this deplorable condition, he found every day his dangers encrea&s;e, and his pur&s;uers making nearer advances. In this di&s;tre&s;s he was obliged to conceal him&s;elf in the mar&s;hes of Minturnum, where he &s;pent the night up to his chin in a quagmire. At break of day he left this di&s;mal place, and made towards the &s;ea &s;ide, in hopes of finding a &s;hip to facilitate his e&s;cape, but being known and di&s;covered by &s;ome of the inhabitants, he was conducted to a neighbouring town with an halter round his neck, and with|out cloaths, and thus covered over with mud, he was &s;ent to pri&s;on. The governor of the place, willing to conform to the orders of the &s;enate, &s;oon after &s;ent a Cimbrian &s;lave to di&s;patch him, but the barbarian no &s;ooner entered the dungeon for this purpo&s;e, but he &s;topt &s;hort, intimidated by the dreadful vi&s;age and awful voice of this fallen general, who &s;ternly demanded, if he he had the pre&s;umption to kill Caius Marius? The &s;lave unable to reply, threw down his &s;word, and ru&s;hing back from the pri&s;on, cried out, that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to kill him! The governor con&s;ider|ing the fear of the &s;lave as an omen in the unhappy exile's favour, gave him once more his freedom, and commending him to his for|tune,
<PB N="359" REF="370">
provided him with a &s;hip to convey him from Italy. He from thence made the be&s;t of his way to the i&s;land of Aenaria, and &s;ailing onward, was forced by a tempe&s;t upon the coa&s;t of Sicily. Here a Roman quae&s;tor who hap|pened to be at the &s;ame place, re&s;olved to &s;eize him, by which he lo&s;t &s;ixteen of his crew, who were killed in their endeavours to cover his re|treat to the &s;hip. He afterwards landed in Africa, near Carthage, and went in a melan|choly manner, to place him&s;elf among the ruins of that de&s;olated place. He &s;oon however, had orders from the praetor who governed there, to retire. Marius, who remembered his having once &s;erved this very man, when in nece&s;&s;ity, could not &s;uppre&s;s his &s;orrow, at finding ingra|titude in every quarter of the world, and pre|paring to obey, de&s;ired the me&s;&s;enger to tell his ma&s;ter, that he had &s;een Marius &s;itting among the ruins of Carthage, intimating the greatne&s;s of his own fall, by the de&s;olation that was round him. He then embarked once more, and not knowing where to land without encounter|ing an enemy, he &s;pent the winter at &s;ea, ex|pecting every hour, the return of a me&s;&s;enger from his &s;on, whom he had &s;ent to &s;ollicit pro|tection from an African prince, who&s;e name was Mandra&s;tal. After long expectation, in|&s;tead of the me&s;&s;enger, his &s;on him&s;elf arrived, having e&s;caped from the inho&s;pitable court of
<PB N="360" REF="371">
that monarch, where he had been kept, not as a friend, but a pri&s;oner, and had returned ju&s;t time enough to prevent his father from &s;haring the &s;ame rate. It was in this &s;ituation, that they were informed of the activity of Cinna in their favour, and accordingly made the be&s;t of their way to join him.</P>
<P>Cinna, upon being apprized of their ap|proach, &s;ent his lictors, with all other marks of di&s;tinction, to join them, but Marius would not accept of the&s;e in&s;tances of re&s;pect: he &s;ent them back, as being ill &s;uited to his abject &s;ituation, and affected to appear in the wretch|ed habit which he had worn in his misfortunes. His beard was long and neglected, his pace &s;low and &s;olemn, and all his actions &s;hewed a mind &s;tung into re&s;entment, and meditating revenge: he now therefore, went among the towns, exciting them to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel, which he taught them to think was their own. Five hundred of the principal citizens of Rome went down to congratulate his return; a large number of veterans, who had fought under his &s;tandard, came to offer him their &s;ervice, and to encrea&s;e his forces &s;till more, he proclaim|ed freedom to all &s;laves who &s;hould join him, by which means, great crowds flocked to him from every quarter. His fir&s;t operation was to take the city of O&s;tia by &s;torm; he then ad|vanced with his whole army, and po&s;ted him|&s;elf
<PB N="361" REF="372">
upon the Janiculum, an hill that overlooked Rome, where he was joined by Cinna, with an army as numerous as his own, and both now re&s;olved to lay &s;iege to their native city.</P>
<P>The &s;enate and con&s;uls were now driven al|mo&s;t to de&s;pair; it was too late to &s;end to Sylla, who was gaining victories in A&s;ia, while his party was upon the brink of ruin at home. Cneius Pompeius commanded an army near Rome, but his actions were &s;o equivocal, that neither &s;ide could rely upon him, while both equally feared him. They &s;ent to Metellus, then lying with a body of troops among the Samnites, but his &s;oldiers, in&s;tead of granting them any aid, &s;oon after joined with Marius. Thus de&s;erted by all, they daily &s;aw the towns about the city taken and plundered, and va&s;t numbers of &s;laves every hour de&s;erting over to the enemy. In this exigence, they had no other re&s;ource but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: they accordingly re|&s;olved to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to the two generals, a&s;&s;uring them of their ready attachment, and de|&s;iring them to enter the city peaceably, and to &s;pare their own countrymen. Cinna however, refu&s;ed to grant any audience, till he knew in what manner he was to be addre&s;&s;ed, whether as a private man, or as con&s;ul, and fir&s;t officer of the &s;tate. This, for a while, created &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment; but it was vain to deliberate, when &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was the only alternative. Cinna
<PB N="362" REF="373">
being re&s;tored to the con&s;ul&s;hip, now received the amba&s;&s;adors of the &s;enate in form, who in|vited him into the city, and reque&s;ted him to undertake the duties of his office; they en|treated him to regard his countrymen with ten|derne&s;s, and endeavoured to obtain from him an oath, that he would put no man to death, but after a legal manner, and conformable to the ancient u&s;ages of Rome. Cinna refu&s;ed the oath, but promi&s;ed, that willingly he would not be the cau&s;e of any man's death. During this conference, Marius continued &s;tanding by the con&s;ul's tribunal, ob&s;erving a profound &s;ilence, but his furious air, and eyes glancing with fire, were but too &s;ure pre&s;ages of the carnage he meditated within.</P>
<P>The conference being ended, Cinna and Ma|rius pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the gates of the city, at the head of their troops: Cinna marched in fir&s;t, accompanied by his guards, but Marius &s;topped, and refu&s;ed to enter, alledging, that having been bani&s;hed by a public decree, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have another to authorize his re|turn. It was thus that he de&s;ired to give his meditated cruelties the appearance of ju&s;tice, and while he was about to de&s;troy thou&s;ands, to pretend an implicit veneration for the laws. In pur&s;uance of his de&s;ire, an a&s;&s;embly of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> people being called, they began to rever&s;e hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> bani&s;hment, but they had &s;carce gone throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

three of the tribes, when incapable of contain|ing his de&s;ire of revenge, he entered the city at the head of his guards, and ma&s;&s;acred all who had ever been obnoxious to him, without remor&s;e or pity. Octavius the con&s;ul was kil|led in his chair of office; Merula, who had been his colleague in the room of Cinna, kil|led him&s;elf, to avoid falling by the enemy; Caius and Lucius Julius, Serranus, Lentulus, Numitorius and Bebius, all &s;enators of the fir&s;t rank, were butchered in the &s;treets, their heads placed upon the ro&s;trum, and their bodies given to be devoured by dogs; many more &s;hared the &s;ame fate; the &s;atellites of Marius breathing &s;laughter and vengeance, &s;tabbed the fathers of families in in their own hou&s;es, violated the cha&s;tity of matrons, and carried away their children by force. Several who &s;ought to pro|pitiate the tyrant's rage, were murdered by his command in his pre&s;ence: many even of tho&s;e who had never offended him were put to death, and at la&s;t, even his own officers never approach|ed him but with terror. Having in this man|ner puni&s;hed his enemies, he next abrogated all the laws which were made by his rival, and then made him&s;elf con&s;ul with Cinna. Thus gratified in his two favourite pa&s;&s;ions, vengeance and ambition; having once &s;aved his country, and now deluged it with blood, at la&s;t, as if willing to crown the pile of &s;laughter
<PB N="364" REF="375">
which he had made, with his own body, he died the month after, aged &s;eventy, not without &s;u&s;picion of having ha&s;tened his end.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the&s;e accounts were brought to Sylla, who was &s;ent again&s;t Mithri|dates, and who was performing many &s;ignal &s;ervices again&s;t him. That monarch having cau&s;ed an hundred and fifty thou&s;and Romans, who were in his dominions, to be &s;lain in cold blood, next &s;ent his general Archelaus to op|po&s;e Sylla; however, he was defeated near Athens, with the lo&s;s of an immen&s;e number of his forces. Another battle en&s;ued, by which the Roman general recovered all the countries that had been u&s;urped by Mithridates. The lo&s;s of the king's fleet followed &s;oon after, &s;o that both parties were now inclined to an accommo|dation; Mithridates induced by his lo&s;&s;es, and Sylla by a de&s;ire of returning home, to take vengeance on his enemies in Rome. A peace was accordingly &s;oon after concluded, the prin|cipal articles of which were, that Mithridates &s;hould defray the charges of the war, and &s;hould be content with his own hereditary do|minions. <MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."> Thus having in le&s;s than three years brought the A&s;iatic war to an honourable pe|riod, Sylla prepared for his return, previou&s;ly informing the &s;enate by letter, of all the great &s;ervices he had done the &s;tate, and the ungrate|ful return he had received, from &s;uch as envied
<PB N="365" REF="376">
his fortune; adding a dreadful menace, that he would &s;oon be at the gates of Rome with a victorious and powerful army, to take &s;ignal re|venge upon his own enemies and tho&s;e of the &s;tate. The &s;enate, who were now to be con&s;i|dered rather as a party formed by Marius, than as the independent protectors of Rome, greatly dreaded the effects of Sylla's return: they al|ready anticipated the &s;laughters he was about to make, and therefore &s;ent to treat with him, of|fering to comply with whatever terms he &s;hould propo&s;e, provided he let them know the limits he intended to &s;et to his re&s;entment. They even ordered Cinna, who as we have ob&s;erved before, had been elected con&s;ul with Marius, to di&s;continue his levies, and join with them in deprecating Sylla's anger by timely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Cinna however, knew too well how little mercy he had to expect from his opponent, and in&s;tead of obeying the &s;enate, returned them an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, but in the mean time, proceeded to rai&s;e forces, and to oppo&s;e Sylla even in A&s;ia, by &s;ending an army thither, under pretence, that what was acted again&s;t Mithridates hither|to, was again&s;t the con&s;ent, and without the authority of the &s;enate. For this purpo&s;e he di&s;patched a body of forces under the command of Valerius Flaccus, his colleague in the con&s;ul&s;hip, into A&s;ia. However, as this leader was unexperienced in the field, Fimbria, an old
<PB N="366" REF="377">
&s;oldier of reputation, was &s;ent as his lieutenant, with directions to correct by his experience, the too great impetuo&s;ity of the general. They &s;oon however, began to differ, and the breach wid|ening every day, the con&s;ul thought proper to depo&s;e Fimbria from his command. But all confidence and order was now lo&s;t in the mili|tary as well as in the civil departments of the &s;tate. Fimbria, in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to his &s;uperior, brought his cau&s;e before the army; a general mutiny en&s;ued; the con&s;ul attempted to e&s;cape, but being di&s;covered at the bottom of a well, was dragged out, and murdered by his own &s;oldiers. In the mean time, Fimbria taking the command of the army, led it again&s;t Mithridates, over whom he gained a &s;ignal vic|tory, and might have compleated his triumph over that monarch, but the &s;ame di&s;obedience which he was guilty of to his own commander, his &s;oldiers practi&s;ed again&s;t him, for &s;hortly af|ter, at Sylla's approach, his troops all de&s;erted, to join their fellow-citizens in the other army, &s;o that Fimbria being thus left alone, fled to the temple of Ae&s;culapius in Pergamus, where he fell upon his &s;word, but the wound not proving mortal, his &s;lave di&s;patched him, killing him&s;elf upon the body of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this army did not intimidate Cinna from making prepara|tions to repel his opponent. Being joined by
<PB N="367" REF="378">
Carbo, who was now elected in the room of Valerius, who had been &s;lain, together with young Marius, who inherited all the abilities and the ambition of his father, he determined to &s;end over part of the forces he had rai&s;ed into Dal|matia, to oppo&s;e Sylla before he entered Italy. Some troops were accordingly embarked, but the&s;e being di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, the re&s;t that had not yet put to &s;ea, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go. Upon this, Cinna, quite furious at their di&s;obe|dience, ru&s;hed forward to per&s;uade them to their duty. However, one of the mo&s;t mutinous of the &s;oldiers being &s;truck by an officer, and re|turning the blow, he was apprehended for his crime. This ill-timed &s;everity produced a tu|mult and a mutiny through the whole army, and while Cinna did all he could to prevent or appea&s;e it, he was run through the body by one of the crowd. The army being thus de|prived of their principal leader, continued un|der Carbo, who kept him&s;elf con&s;ul, without a colleague, for &s;ome time. The next year's con&s;uls being Urbanus and Scipio, new levies were made, and the affairs of the party &s;eemed to wear a very favourable a&s;pect. It was not doubted, but Sylla would take &s;ignal vengeance for his late injuries, and do all in his power to &s;uppre&s;s the late popular laws, exacted in his ab&s;ence: all the lower part of the citizens there|fore, and the majority of the &s;enate were again&s;t

him; the one from principles of democracy, the other through fear. Thus a great con|cour&s;e of people came from different part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Italy, to take part with the con&s;uls, who &s;oon &s;aw them&s;elves at the head of an army, &s;upe|rior to that of Sylla, who&s;e approach was &s;o much dreaded by all.</P>
<P>During the&s;e preparations, Sylla was not le&s;s expeditious, by long and forced marches, in returning to his native country, which he intended to deluge with blood. Being arrived at Dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">c|chium, where he had prepared a fleet to con|vey him into Italy, he harrangued his army before they embarked, entreating, that they would engage them&s;elves by an oath, to conti|nue faithful to his cau&s;e. This they unani|mou&s;ly con&s;ented to do, and as an earne&s;t of their &s;incerity, offered him all the money which they had gained in their late expeditions, to|wards &s;upporting the expences of the war. Sylla, plea&s;ed at their alacrity, refu&s;ed their in|tended favours, a&s;&s;uring them, that they &s;hould &s;oon &s;hare much greater rewards from his bounty, than he had as yet been able to be|&s;tow, and then embarking his troops, landed them, after a favourable pa&s;&s;age, at Bru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">du|&s;ium in Italy.</P>

him. Metellus was the fir&s;t, with a large body of forces which he had collected in his way. Marcus Cra&s;&s;us came with a &s;upply, as al&s;o Cethegus; but of all the &s;uccours which he received, none were more timely or plea&s;ing, than tho&s;e which were brought him by Cneius Pompey, afterwards &s;urnamed the Great. This commander, though yet but twenty-three, began already to &s;hew the dawnings of that ambition, which afterwards &s;hone with &s;uch lu&s;tre in the commonwealth. Though at that time inve&s;ted with no public character, he found means to rai&s;e an army of three legions in Picaenum, and to overthrow Brutus, who commanded the troops of the oppo&s;ite faction in that di&s;trict. This victory was al&s;o &s;ignalized by his killing the general of the Gauli&s;h cavalry, who oppo&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;ingle combat, for which he was &s;a|luted with the highe&s;t marks of re&s;pect by Sylla, who &s;eemed to have a pre&s;cience of his future greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>A civil war being thus determined upon, and both parties being now advanced very near each other, Sylla was willing to try, how far the immen&s;e riches he brought with him from A&s;ia, were capable of &s;haking the enemies forces, without a battle. For this purpo&s;e, he at fir&s;t pretended to be aver&s;e to engaging, and &s;ent deputies to Scipio the con&s;ul, who com|manded again&s;t him, with propo&s;als for coming
<PB N="370" REF="381">
to a treaty. The con&s;ul, who &s;ought for nothing &s;o much as peace, very readily embraced his offers, but de&s;ired time, previou&s;ly to confer with Urbanus his colleague, upon a mea&s;ure in which he was equally concerned. This was all that Sylla de&s;ired, for in the mean time, a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of arms being agreed upon, his &s;oldiers went into the oppo&s;ite camp, di&s;playing tho&s;e riches which they had acquired in their expedi|tions, and offering to participate with their fel|low-citizens, in ca&s;e they changed their party. The &s;ame motives that had prevailed on the &s;ol|diers of Fimbria to de&s;ert him, now prevailed upon the&s;e to de&s;ert their general. The whole army declared unanimou&s;ly for Sylla, and Sci|pio &s;carce knew that he was for&s;aken and de|po&s;ed, till he was informed of it by a party of the enemy, who entering his tent, made him and his &s;on their pri&s;oners. Sylla however, acted with great moderation towards him; he would permit no injury to be done to the con&s;ul, but employed all his arts to bring him over to his party. After much entreaty, finding him in|flexible, he generou&s;ly gave him his freedom, having previou&s;ly obtained his promi&s;e, not to command again&s;t him during the re&s;t of his con&s;ul&s;hip.</P>
<P>Sylla having &s;ucceeded &s;o well in this in|&s;tance, re&s;olved to try the &s;ame arts upon the army commanded by Norbanus, the other con|&s;ul. He &s;ent deputies to him, de&s;iring a con|ference,
<PB N="371" REF="382">
but the con&s;ul, in&s;tructed by the di&s;|grace of his colleague, confined the deputies, and marched directly again&s;t him, hoping to come upon him by &s;urprize. An engagement en&s;ued, in which Sylla's men, though attacked in di&s;order, repaired by their courage, what they wanted in regularity. Norbanus lo&s;t &s;even thou|&s;and men, and was obliged to take refuge in Capua, with the remainder of his army.</P>
<P>Italy now began to feel all the de&s;olations and mi&s;eries of a declared civil war, nor were the &s;ecret intrigues of corruption carried on by both parties with le&s;s per&s;everance and a&s;&s;iduity: the emi&s;&s;aries of each were &s;een going diligently during the whole winter, up and down among the &s;tates of Italy, labouring by all the arts of bribery and per&s;ua&s;ion to gain over forces to their cau&s;e. Sylla was particularly ver&s;ed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;eduction, and va&s;t &s;ums of that money which had been plundered from the Ea&s;t, went all over the country, and even among the barbarous nations of Gaul, to extend his inte|re&s;ts. On the other hand, the Samnites, to the number of forty thou&s;and men, declared in fa|vour of Carbo, his chief oppo&s;er, who was now cho&s;en con&s;ul a third time, with young Marius, of whom his party had formed great expecta|tions. The operations in the field, which had been &s;u&s;pended during the winter, opened with &s;till greater vigour in the beginning of the
<PB N="372" REF="383">
&s;pring. Marius, at the head of twenty-five co|horts, offered Sylla battle, which this general, knowing how the troops again&s;t him were pre|di&s;po&s;ed, readily accepted. At fir&s;t the fortune of the day &s;eemed doubtful, but ju&s;t at that very period in which victory begins to waver, a part of the troops of Marius, which had been previou&s;ly corrupted, fled in di&s;order, and thus decided the fate of the day. Marius having vainly endeavoured to rally his troops, was the la&s;t that fled, and went to take refuge in Prae|ne&s;te, a &s;trong city that was &s;till &s;tedfa&s;t in his cau&s;e. Sylla clo&s;ely pur&s;ued him there, and in|ve&s;ted the city on every &s;ide: then having di&s;|po&s;ed his army in &s;uch a manner, as that none of the defendants could e&s;cape, and no forces could be thrown into the garri&s;on from without, he marched at the head of a detachment to Rome.</P>
<P>The partizans of Marius having been apprized of his defeat, abandoned the city with precipi|tation, &s;o that Sylla approached without re&s;i&s;|tance. The inhabitants, thinned by famine and all the terrors that attend a civil war, opened their gates upon his arrival, wherefore entering the Forum, and a&s;&s;embling the people, he re|primanded them for their infidelity. However, he exhorted them not to be dejected, for he was &s;till re&s;olved to pardon and protect them. He ob&s;erved, that he was obliged by the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, to take vigorous mea&s;ures, and that
<PB N="373" REF="384">
none but their enemies and his own &s;hould &s;uffer. He then put up the goods of tho&s;e that fled, to &s;ale, and leaving a &s;mall garri&s;on in the city, re|turned to be&s;iege his rival.</P>
<P>Young Marius on the other hand, made many attempts to rai&s;e the &s;iege, but all his de&s;igns were known to Sylla, before they were put into execution. Wherever his Sallies were pointed, the peculiar attention of Sylla's lieutenant &s;eem|ed to be directed there. Thus frequently fru&s;|trated in his attempts to repre&s;s, or at lea&s;t to e&s;cape his be&s;iegers, he gave way to that re&s;ent|ment, which was remarkable in his family, and a&s;cribing his detention to the treachery of Sylla's friends, who pretended to remain neuter, he &s;ent orders to Rome, to Brutus, who was Prae|tor there, to put all tho&s;e &s;enators to death, whom he &s;u&s;pected to be in the intere&s;t of his rival. With this cruel command Brutus im|mediately complied, and many of the fir&s;t rank, among whom were Domitius Anti&s;tius, and Scaevola, were &s;lain as they were leaving the &s;enate. Thus, whatever faction was victorious, Rome was &s;till a mi&s;erable &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Both factions thus exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t degree, and expecting no mercy on either part, gave vent to their fury in &s;everal engagements. The forces on the &s;ide of Marius were the mo&s;t numerous, but tho&s;e of Sylla better united and more under &s;ubordination. Carbo, who com|manded
<PB N="374" REF="385">
an army for Marius in the field, &s;ent eight legions to Praene&s;te, to relieve his col|league, but they were met by Pompey in a de|file, who &s;lew many of them, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. Carbo, joined by Urbanus, &s;oon after en|gaged Metellus, but was overcome with the lo&s;s of ten thou&s;and men &s;lain, and &s;ix thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners. In con&s;equence of this defeat, Ur|banus killed him&s;elf, and Carbo fled to Africa, where, after wandering a long time, he was at la&s;t delivered up to Pompey, who to plea&s;e Syl|la, ordered him to be beheaded. Still however, a numerous army of the Samnites were in the field, headed by &s;everal Roman generals, and by Tele&s;inus, who though a Samnite, had &s;hewn him&s;elf equal to the greate&s;t commanders of the age. The&s;e were joined by four legions, com|manded by Carianus, who was &s;till ob&s;tinately bent upon continuing the war. The&s;e united, were re&s;olved to make one de&s;perate effort to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Praene&s;te, or to peri&s;h in the attempt. Accordingly, Tele&s;inus made a &s;hew of advancing with great boldne&s;s, to force the enemy's lines of circumvallation. At the &s;ame time, Sylla, at the head of a victorious army, faced him in front, while orders were &s;ent to Pompey, to follow and attack him in the rear. The Samnite general however, &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;uperior to both, in the&s;e operations, for judging of their de&s;igns by their motions, he
<PB N="375" REF="386">
led off his troops by night, and by forced marches, appeared next morning upon the mountains that overlooked Rome. This wretched city had ju&s;t time &s;ufficient to &s;hut its gates, to prevent his entrance, but he hoped to &s;eize the place by a bold a&s;&s;ault, and encourag|ing his &s;oldiers, both by their ancient enmity to the Roman &s;tate, and their hopes of immen&s;e riches upon the capture, he brought on his men, and led them boldly to the very walls. Appius Claudius, who was at that time in Rome, and in the intere&s;ts of Sylla, made a &s;ally to oppo&s;e him, rather with hopes of delay|ing the a&s;&s;ailants, than of entirely repre&s;&s;ing them. The Romans fought with that vigour, which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of defending every thing dear in&s;pires. But Appius was killed in the combat, and the re&s;t di&s;heartened by the lo&s;s of their general, &s;eemed preparing for flight. Ju&s;t at this interval, a party of Sylla's hor&s;e ap|peared at the oppo&s;ite gates, who throwing them&s;elves into the city, and ha&s;tening through it, met the a&s;&s;ailants on the other &s;ide. The de&s;perate fury of the&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;u&s;|pended the fate of the battle, till Sylla with his whole army had time to arrive. It was then that a general and dreadful conflict en&s;ued be|tween the Samnite and the Roman army. The citizens from their walls beheld thou&s;ands fall on both &s;ides. At fir&s;t, the forces com|manded
<PB N="376" REF="387">
by Sylla on the left, gave way, but his lieutenant Cra&s;&s;us was victorious on the right. The battle continued all day, till late at night, nor was it till the morning, that Sylla found him&s;elf completely victorious. He then vi&s;ited the field of battle, on which more than fifty thou&s;and of the vanqui&s;hed and the victors lay promi&s;cuou&s;ly. Eight thou&s;and of the Sam|nites were made pri&s;oners, and killed in cold blood, after the engagement. Marcius and Carinus attempting to e&s;cape, were taken, and their heads being cut off, were &s;ent by Sylla's command, to be carried round the walls of Praene&s;te. At this &s;orrowful &s;ight, the inhabi|tants of the place being now de&s;titute of provi|&s;ions, and de&s;pairing of all &s;uccour from without, re&s;olved to &s;urrender, but it was only to experi|ence the unrelenting fury of the conqueror, who ordered all the males to be &s;lain. Marius, the cau&s;e of the&s;e calamities, was at fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ing, and it was thought had got off, but he was at la&s;t di&s;covered lying dead, with a captain of the Samnites, at the i&s;&s;ue of one of the &s;ubterra|nean pa&s;&s;ages that led from the city, where they had tried to e&s;cape, but finding it guard|ed by the enemy, killed them&s;elves. The city of Norba was now all that remained un|&s;ubdued in Italy, but the inhabitants, after a long re&s;i&s;tance, dreading the fate of Praene&s;te, &s;et their town on fire, and de&s;perately peri&s;hed
<PB N="377" REF="388">
in the flames. The de&s;truction of this place, put an end to the civil war; Sylla now became undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of his country, and entered Rome at the head of his army. Happy, had he &s;upported in peace the glory which he had acquired in war, or had he cea&s;ed to live, when he cea&s;ed to conquer.</P>
<P>Being now no longer obliged to wear the ma&s;k of lenity, he began his reign by a&s;&s;em|bling the people, and de&s;ired an implicit obe|dience to his commands, if they expected fa|vour. He then publi&s;hed, that tho&s;e who ex|pected pardon for their late offences, &s;hould gain it by de&s;troying the enemies of the &s;tate. This was a new mode of pro&s;cription, by which the arms of all were turned again&s;t all. Great numbers peri&s;hed by this mutual power, which was given the people of de|&s;troying each other, and nothing was to be found in every place, but menaces, di&s;tru&s;t, and treachery. Eight thou&s;and who had e&s;caped the general carnage, offered them&s;elves to the conqueror at Rome: he ordered them to be put into the Villa Publica, a large hou&s;e in the Campus Martius, and at the &s;ame time convok|ed the &s;enate: there he &s;poke with great fluen|cy, and in a manner no way di&s;compo&s;ed, of his own exploits, and in the mean time, ordered all tho&s;e wretches whom he had confined, to be &s;lain. The &s;enate, amazed at the horrrid outcries of
<PB N="378" REF="389">
the &s;ufferers, at fir&s;t thought that the city was given up to plunder; but Sylla, with an unem|barra&s;&s;ed air informed them, that it was only &s;ome criminals who were puni&s;hed by his order, and that they needed not to make them&s;elves un|ea&s;y about their fate. The day after, he pro&s;cribed forty &s;enators and &s;ixteen hundred knights, and after an intermi&s;&s;ion of two days, forty &s;enators more, with an infinite number of the riche&s;t citizens of Rome. He declared the children and the grand-children of the oppo&s;ite party, in|famous, and dive&s;ted of the rights of freedom. He ordained by a public edict, that tho&s;e who &s;aved or harboured any of the pro&s;cribed, &s;hould &s;uffer in their place. He &s;et a price upon the heads of &s;uch as were thus to be de&s;troyed, two talents being the reward affixed for every murder. Slaves invited by &s;uch offers, were &s;een to kill their ma&s;|ters, and &s;till more &s;hocking to humanity, chil|dren, who&s;e hands &s;till reeked with the blood of their parents, came confidently to demand the wages of parricide. Nor were the enemies of the &s;tate the only &s;ufferers; Sylla permitted his &s;ol|diers to revenge their private injuries, &s;o that hu&s;|bands were &s;lain, by &s;uch as de&s;ired to enjoy thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> widows, and children were &s;lain in the embrace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their parents, who were &s;oon to &s;hare the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fate. Riches now became dangerous to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or, and even the reputation of fortune was equi|valent to guilt: Aurelius, a peaceable citize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="379" REF="390">
without any other crime, found his name among the number of the pro&s;cribed, and could not help crying out ju&s;t before his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, that he owed his death to the magnificence of his palace at Alba. But the brother of Marius felt the conqueror's mo&s;t refined cruelty! Fir&s;t he had his eyes plucked out deliberately, then his hands and legs cut off at &s;everal times, to lengthen his torments, and in this agoniz|ing &s;ituation he was left to expire. But the&s;e barbarities were not confined only to Rome, the pro&s;cription was extended to many of the inhabitants of all the cities of Italy, and even whole towns and di&s;tricts were ordered to be laid de&s;olate. The&s;e were given to his &s;oldiers as re|wards for their fidelity, who &s;till wanting more, excited him to new cruelty. In this general &s;laughter, Julius Cae&s;ar, who had married Cin|na's daughter, very hardly e&s;caped the mi&s;eries of the times: Sylla was prevailed upon to let him live, though he was heard to &s;ay, that there were many Mariu&s;es in Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e arbitrary confi&s;cations, and numerous large&s;&s;es which were given to his fol|lowers, were not to be retained without &s;ome &s;hare of continuing power. He therefore re&s;olved to inve&s;t him&s;elf with the dictator&s;hip, which, by uniting all civil as well as military power in his own per&s;on, he might thus give an air of ju&s;tice to every oppre&s;&s;ion. He therefore withdrew
<PB N="380" REF="391">
a while from the city, and gave order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; that &s;ince affairs &s;till remained un&s;ettled, the people &s;hould be applied to, to create a dictator, and that not for any limited time, but till the pub|lic grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed. To the&s;e di|rections he added his reque&s;t, which, as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all power, was equivalent to a com|mand, that he him&s;elf &s;hould be cho&s;en. To this the people being con&s;trained to yield. He was cho&s;en perpetual dictator; and thus the Romans received a ma&s;ter inve&s;ted with an au|thority far more ab&s;olute, than any of their kings had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of before.</P>
<P>The government of Rome having now pa&s;&s;ed through all the forms of monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, at length began to &s;ettle into de&s;poti&s;m, from which, though it made &s;ome faint &s;truggles to be free, yet it never compleatly extricated it&s;elf, till its total di&s;&s;olution. Sylla, to amu&s;e the people with a &s;hew of their former go|vernment, permitted them to have con&s;uls, but at the &s;ame time took care, that none but his own creatures &s;hould be elected, and that all their power &s;hould be entirely derived from him. He made &s;everal new laws for regulating the different offices of the &s;tate. He totally de&s;troyed the power of the tribunes, by enacting, that tho&s;e who bore it, &s;hould be incapable of obtaining any other office. He added three hundred of the knights to the &s;enate, and ten thou&s;and of
<PB N="381" REF="392">
the &s;laves of tho&s;e who were pro&s;cribed, to the body of the people. To e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e regula|tions more firmly, he appropriated to him&s;elf the trea&s;ures of the public, and lavi&s;hed them in widening his dependencies, and &s;trengthen|ing his intere&s;t: he &s;eemed to think he could never &s;ufficiently reward his creatures, if they were but implicit in their obedience. Cra&s;|&s;us, who was already the riche&s;t man in the &s;tate, was ever &s;oliciting an accumulation of his favours, and buying up the effects of &s;uch as were pro&s;cribed, at an under rate. Pompey put away his wife Anti&s;tia to oblige him, and mar|ried Emilia, the dictator's &s;tep-child. He at|tempted to exerci&s;e the &s;ame power over Julius Cae&s;ar, by obliging him to repudiate his wife Cornelia, but that young Roman cho&s;e to bani&s;h him&s;elf from the city, rather than comply, and never returned, till Sylla was no more.</P>
<P>In this manner he continued to govern with capricious tyranny, none daring to re&s;i&s;t his power. Lucretius Offella &s;hewed how danger|ous it was to controul a tyrant in the full exer|ci&s;e of his authority: this man ventured to of|fer him&s;elf for the con&s;ul&s;hip, in oppo&s;ition to one of Sylla's decrees, which had forbidden any man's a&s;piring to that dignity, without having gone through the regular gradations of office. However, as he had formerly rendered &s;ome very &s;ignal &s;ervices to his party, he thought
<PB N="382" REF="393">
that would excu&s;e him. He was therefore at fir&s;t de&s;ired to de&s;i&s;t from his attempt, but per|&s;evering, Sylla ordered one of his &s;atellites to &s;tab him, and then threatened to &s;erve any other per&s;on in the &s;ame manner, who &s;hould attempt to invalidate his authority. By &s;uch means as the&s;e, he was &s;ubmitted to with the mo&s;t blind obedience. Whenever he propo&s;ed laws, the people a&s;&s;embled, not to deliberate upon their fitne&s;s, but to give them the &s;anction of their con&s;ent. They found them&s;elves quite ejected from any concern in the &s;tate, and &s;aw nothing before them, but a pro&s;pect of hope|le&s;s and confirmed &s;lavery. It was at this junc|ture, that contrary to the expectations of all mankind, Sylla laid down the dictator&s;hip, hav|ing held it not quite three years.</P>
<P>It was not without the greate&s;t &s;urprize, that the people &s;aw this conqueror, who had made him&s;elf &s;o many enemies in every part of the &s;tate, quitting a power he had earned by &s;uch various dangers, and reducing him&s;elf to the rank of a private citizen. But their wonder encrea&s;ed, when they heard him, after &s;o many acts of cruelty, and &s;uch numberle&s;s ma&s;&s;acres, offering to take his trial before the people, whom he con&s;tituted judges of his conduct. Having dive&s;ted him|&s;elf in their pre&s;ence of his office, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the lictors who guarded him, he continued to walk for &s;ome time in the Forum, unattended
<PB N="383" REF="394">
and alone. At the approach of evening he re|tired homewards, the people following him all the way in a kind of &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, mix|ed with the profounde&s;t re&s;pect. Of all that great multitude which he had &s;o often in&s;ulted and terrified, none was found hardy enough to reproach or accu&s;e him, except one young man, who pur&s;ued him with in&s;ulting language to his own door. Sylla di&s;dained replying to &s;o mean an adver&s;ary, but turning to tho&s;e who attended him, ob&s;erved, that this fellow's in&s;o|lence would for the future prevent any man's laying down an office of &s;uch &s;upreme autho|rity. It is not ea&s;y to divine the motives of Sylla's abdication, whether they were from vanity, or a deep laid &s;cheme of policy. Whe|ther being &s;atiated with the u&s;ual adulation which he received for his conque&s;ts, he was now de&s;irous al&s;o of receiving &s;ome for his pa|trioti&s;m, or whether dreading an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from &s;ome &s;ecret enemy, he was willing to di&s;arm him, by retiring from the &s;plendors of an envied &s;ituation. However this may be, he &s;oon retired into the country, in order to enjoy the plea&s;ures of tranquility and &s;ocial happi|ne&s;s; but he did not long &s;urvive his abdica|tion; he died of that di&s;ea&s;e which is called, the morbus pedicularis, a loath&s;ome object, and of mortifying to human ambition. He was the fir&s;t of his family who&s;e body was burnt,
<PB N="384" REF="395">
for having ordered the remains of Marius to be taken out of his grave and thrown into the river Anio, he was apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ame in|&s;ult upon his own, if left to the u&s;ual way of burial. A little before his death, he made his own epitaph, the tenor of which was, That no man had ever exceeded him in doing good to his friends or injury to his enemies.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Sylla was dead, the old di&s;&s;en&s;ions that had been &s;mothered awhile by the terror of his power, bur&s;t out again into a flame between the two factions, &s;upported &s;everally by the two con&s;uls, Catulus and Lepidus, who were wholly oppo&s;ite to each other in party and politics. Lepidus re&s;olved, at all adventures, to re&s;cind the acts of Sylla, and recall the exiled Marians, beginning openly to &s;olicit the people to &s;up|port him in that re&s;olution. This attempt, though plau&s;ible, was at this time particularly un&s;ea&s;onable, when the &s;tate was ju&s;t recovering from the wounds it had lately received in the civil war. On the other hand Catulus, who&s;e father had been condemned to die by Marius, inherit|ing the principles of his family, vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, and effectually counter-acted the de|&s;igns of his colleague. Lepidus thus finding him&s;elf unable to attain his ends, without re|curring to arms, retired to his government of Gaul, with intent to rai&s;e a force &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue all oppo&s;ition, where the report of his
<PB N="385" REF="396">
levies and military preparations gave &s;uch um|brage to the &s;enate, that they &s;oon abrogated his command. Upon this, he advanced into Italy at the head of a large army, and marched in an ho&s;tile manner towards Rome, to demand a &s;econd con&s;ul&s;hip. He had with him, &s;everal of the chief magi&s;trates, and the good wi&s;hes of all the tribunes, &s;o that he hoped, by the popularity of his cau&s;e, to advance him&s;elf into Sylla's place, and u&s;urp the &s;overeign au|thority of the &s;tate. Catulus, in the mean time, upon the expiration of his office, was in|ve&s;ted with the charge of defending the govern|ment, and Pompey al&s;o was by a decree of the &s;enate, joined with him in the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e therefore, having united their forces be|fore Lepidus could reach the city, came to an engagement with him, near the Milvian Bridge, within two miles of Rome, where they totally routed and di&s;per&s;ed his whole army. But Ci&s;|alpine Gaul &s;till remaining in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Brutus, his lieutenant, and the father of him who afterwards killed Cae&s;ar; Pompey went to re|duce that province, where, Brutus having &s;u&s;|tained a &s;iege in Modena, was taken, and put to death by Pompey's order. As for Lepidus, he e&s;caped into Sardinia, where he died &s;oon after of grief, to &s;ee his hopes de&s;troyed, and his country fallen under the ari&s;tocratical fac|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="397">
But the hopes of the Marian party did not entirely expire here. A more dangerous ene|my &s;till remained in Spain, who for a while made it doubtful, whether that province or Rome, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the empire of the world. This was Sertorius, a veteran &s;oldier who had his been bred under Marius, and had learned all virtues, without &s;haring one of his vices. He was temperate, ju&s;t, merciful and brave, but his military &s;kill &s;eemed to exceed that of any other general of his time. Upon the ex|tinction of the Marian party, this brave com|mander fell into the hands of Sylla, who di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him with life, upon account of his known moderation. Yet &s;oon after, capriciou&s;ly repenting of this clemency, he pro&s;cribed and drove him to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking &s;afety in a di&s;tant province. Sertorius being thus bani&s;hed from Rome, after &s;everal attempts on Africa and the coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean, found at la&s;t a refuge in Spain, whither, all who fled from Sylla's cruelty, re&s;orted to him, of whom he formed a &s;enate, that gave laws to the whole province. There, by his great abilities and cle|mency, he &s;o gained the hearts of the warlike inhabitants, that for eight years he continued to &s;u&s;tain a war again&s;t the whole power of the Roman &s;tate. Metellus, an old experienced commander, was &s;ent again&s;t him at fir&s;t, but he was &s;o often out-generalled by his oppo|nent,
<PB N="387" REF="398">
that the &s;enate were forced to &s;end their favourite Pompey to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with the be&s;t troops of the empire. Sertorius maintained his ground again&s;t them both, and after many en|gagements, in which he generally came off equal, and often &s;uperior, he began to meditate nothing le&s;s than the inva&s;ion of Italy. But all his &s;chemes were baffled by the treachery of one of his own lieutenants, who was next him in command, and envied his ri&s;ing reputation. This wretch's name was Perpenna, who had &s;ome time before come over to him with the &s;hattered remains of Lepidus's army, and was at fir&s;t an u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant. However, a jealou&s;y ari&s;ing be|tween them, Perpenna invited him to a &s;umptu|ous entertainment, where having intoxicated all his attendants, he fell upon Sertorius, and trea|cherou&s;ly murdered him. But this &s;troke of barbarity only &s;erved to ruin his party, which had been entirely &s;upported by the reputation of the general: for &s;oon after, Perpenna being ea&s;ily overthrown by Pompey, was taken pri|&s;oner, and all the revolted provinces readily &s;ubmitted. The conqueror is celebrated on this occa&s;ion, for an action of great prudence and genero&s;ity. Perpenna in hopes to &s;ave his life, offered to make &s;ome important di&s;coveries, and to put into his hands all the papers of Sertorius, in which were &s;everal letters to and from the principal &s;enators of Rome. Pompey however&punc;
<PB N="388" REF="399">
rejecting his offer, ordered the traitor to be &s;lain, and his papers to be burnt without reading them. By the&s;e means he ea&s;ed the people of their fears, and prevented tho&s;e acts of de&s;peration, which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being di&s;covered might have given ri&s;e to.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent pro&s;perity of Pompey was highly plea&s;ing at Rome; he had hitherto been &s;ucce&s;s|ful in all his affairs, and in this in&s;tance, as if fortune had delighted in giving him new op|portunities of &s;erving his country, he &s;eemed pe|culiarly fortunate. Upon his return, he fell in with a large body of &s;laves, that had e&s;caped after their overthrow by Cra&s;&s;us in Italy, and cut them to pieces. This in&s;urrection, which Pompey had the good fortune of thus terminating, was called the Servile war, and took its ri&s;e from a few gla|diators, who broke from their fencing-&s;chool at Capua, and having drawn a number of &s;laves after them, overthrew Glaber the praetor, who was &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s them; and from this &s;ucce&s;s, their number pre&s;ently encrea&s;ed to an army of forty thou&s;and men. With this &s;trength, and headed by Spartacus their general, they &s;u&s;tained a vigorous war for three years, in the very heart of Italy: they defeated &s;everal commanders of con&s;ular and praetorian rank, and even began to talk of attacking Rome. But Cra&s;&s;ius having gathered about him all the forces which were near home, drove them before him to the extremity of
<PB N="389" REF="400">
Rhegium, where for want of ve&s;&s;els to make their e&s;cape, the greate&s;t part of them were de|&s;troyed, and among them Spartacus, fighting bravely to the la&s;t, at the head of his de&s;perate forces. It was the remainder of this wretched band, that Pompey happened to fall in with in his pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the Alps homeward, and as he expre&s;&s;ed it to the &s;enate, by de&s;troying them, plucked up the war by the very roots. Thus ended all the civil wars which were excited by the ambition of Marius and Sylla, a long and di&s;mal period, in which the reader can &s;ide with neither party, as both were equally cruel, ba&s;e, &s;elf-intere&s;ted and venal. The republic had been long fated to de&s;truction, its former ju&s;tice and moderation was gone, and it was immaterial who was to have the overwhelming of a cor|rupted empire.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till, during this interval which we have been de&s;cribing, all the arts of peace had been cultivated, and had ri&s;en almo&s;t to the &s;ummit of perfection. Plautus and Terence, it is true, had flouri&s;hed &s;ome time before, but Lucretius, the boa&s;t of his age, who exceeds as much in poetry, as he falls &s;hort in philo&s;ophy, adorned tho&s;e ill-fated times, and charmed with the har|mony of his ver&s;ification. Learning however, was chiefly cultivated among the great, for lux|ury had not as yet &s;ufficiently de&s;cended to the meaner ranks, to make them reli&s;h the elegant

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. From the Perpetual Dictator&s;hip of Sylla to the Tri|umvirate of Cae&s;ar, Pompey and Cra&s;&s;us.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="680" UNIT="U. C."> ALL factions being now apparently quelled in the empire, it was hoped, that peace would be re&s;tored, and that the commonwealth would have time to re&s;pire from the calamities it had &s;u&s;tained during the civil war. But the &s;pirit of ambition had entered into the &s;tate, and the leading men now &s;aw the po&s;&s;ibility of obtain|ing &s;overeign power by Sylla's example. Of the&s;e chiefly now in favour with the &s;enate and the people, Pompey and Cra&s;&s;us were foremo&s;t, both conquerors, both de&s;irous of power, and both aiming at it by extending their popularity. We have already &s;een Pompey, while very young, performing one of the mo&s;t active parts in the conduct of the empire: we have &s;een him joining with, and conquering in the cau&s;e of Sylla: &s;oon after &s;ent into Africa, and the fir&s;t of the eque&s;trian order who had a triumph. After that, &s;iding again&s;t Lepidus, and then
<PB N="391" REF="402">
conquering the army which had been in Spain commanded by Sertorius. To crown all, ho|noured with the con&s;ul&s;hip in his ab&s;ence, and that before the con&s;ular age. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es had greatly inflamed his pride, and extended his de|&s;ire of glory. Cra&s;&s;us, on the other hand, was equally de&s;irous of obtaining popularity, but being wholly unequal to his rival in military fame, took another road to come at it: this was by ama&s;&s;ing riches, which he gathered from the calamities of his country, only to involve it in new di&s;tre&s;&s;es. He was u&s;ed to &s;ay, that no man &s;hould be reckoned wealthy, who was not able to maintain an army, and in fact, the number of his &s;laves was equal to a large one. He had be&s;ides, the character of a good &s;peaker in the &s;enate, and by his ea&s;y and familiar ad|dre&s;s, and a readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t all who wanted either his protection or his money, he acquired great authority in public affairs. Be&s;ides the rival&s;hip of power between the&s;e two great men, Cra&s;&s;us had another cau&s;e of re&s;entment, which was, Pompey's a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf the glory of terminating the Servile war, for which the other had actually received the honour of a triumph by the &s;enate's command. Both therefore &s;e|cretly wi&s;hed to undermine each other, neither with views of ridding his country of the over|grown power of an a&s;piring citizen, but each with a de&s;ire of e&s;tabli&s;hing his own.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="403">
The fir&s;t opportunity that was afforded of di&s;covering their mutual jealou&s;y, was upon the di&s;banding their troops, with which they had conquered. Neither cho&s;e to begin, &s;o that the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences threatened from their di&s;&s;en&s;ion; but at length, Cra&s;&s;us &s;tifling his re&s;entment, laid down his command, and the other followed his example immediately after. The next trial between them was, who &s;hould be foremo&s;t in obtaining the favour of the peo|ple; Cra&s;&s;us entertained the populace at a thou|&s;and different tables, di&s;tributed corn to the fa|milies of the poor, and fed the greate&s;t part of the citizens for near three months. Pompey on the other hand, laboured to abrogate the laws made again&s;t the people's authority by Sylla: he re&s;tored the power of judging to the knights, which had been formerly granted them by Grac|chus, and gave back to the tribunes of the peo|ple all their former privileges. It was thus that each gave his private aims a public appearance, &s;o that what was in reality ambition in both, took with one the name of liberality, with the other that of freedom.</P>
<P>However, the arts of Pompey &s;eemed upon this occa&s;ion to give him the &s;uperiority. The tribunes, who were re&s;tored to all their former dignities, thought they could never &s;ufficiently recompence their benefactor: they only waited for an opportunity of gratifying his highe&s;t am|bition,
<PB N="393" REF="404">
and this &s;oon offered. A number of Pyrates formerty employed by Mithridates, had by the long continuance of their &s;ucce&s;s in plun|dering all they met, ama&s;&s;ed great wealth, and got together many thou&s;and men of &s;everal nations. They made choice of Cilicia for their principal place of re&s;ort, and not content with robbing by &s;ea, ventured even upon conque&s;ts by land. Italy it&s;elf was not free from their inva&s;ions; where they often landed, and carried away what|ever they met with in their ha&s;ty incur&s;ions. It was now therefore re&s;olved at Rome, to puni&s;h their in&s;olence by &s;ending out a fleet that was capable of utterly de&s;troying their power. For this, Gabinius the tribune preferred a law, that Pompey &s;hould be created admiral, with ab&s;o|lute authority again&s;t the Pyrates for three years: that his power &s;hould extend over the whole Mediterranean &s;ea and its coa&s;ts, to a certain di&s;tance on land: that he &s;hould rai&s;e as many &s;oldiers and mariners as he &s;hould think expedient; and that he &s;hould have from the public trea&s;ury, whatever &s;ums of money he &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the war. This law which the &s;enate vainly attempted to oppo&s;e, gave Pompey a degree of power which he might have ea&s;ily converted to the detriment of his country: but nothing dange|rous was to be feared from a man who&s;e actions always te&s;tified more of vanity than ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="405">
Pompey being thus furni&s;hed with ab&s;olute power over the fleet, di&s;tributed his lieutenants through the &s;everal bays and harbours of the Mediterranean with &s;o much judgment, that he &s;oon forced the enemy from their ports. In the mean time, he him&s;elf, at the head of the large&s;t &s;quadron of his &s;hipping, &s;ailed up and down, vi&s;iting and in&s;tructing &s;uch as he &s;ent upon duty. By the&s;e means, in le&s;s than forty days, he obliged the enemy to take refuge in Cilicia, the only retreat that was left them. He &s;oon followed them there, with &s;ixty of his be&s;t &s;hips, and though they had prepared to give him bat|tle, yet they, upon &s;ight of his fleet, and &s;truck with the terrors of his name, &s;ubmitted to his mercy. As their number amounted to above twenty thou&s;and men, he was unwilling to de|&s;troy them, and yet to permit their returning to their ancient habitations, was not &s;afe. He therefore removed them to places farther di&s;tant from the &s;ea, where he gave them lands, and thus added new &s;ubjects and dominions to the empire of Rome.</P>
<P>This expedition having added greatly to Pompey's reputation, the tribunes now hoped it would be ea&s;ier to advance their favourite &s;till higher; wherefore Manlius, one of the num|ber, preferred a law, that all the armies of the empire, with the government of all A&s;ia, toge|ther with the management of the war again&s;t
<PB N="395" REF="406">
Mithridates and Tigranes, &s;hould be committed to him alone. A power &s;o great and unlimited, awakened all the jealou&s;y of the &s;enate, this they con&s;idered as nothing le&s;s than proclaiming him &s;overeign of the whole empire. This was giving one, already ma&s;ter of the whole fleet, an unlimited power by land, and even &s;eemed to tempt him to en&s;lave his country. The weight of the&s;e rea&s;ons, and &s;till more, the authority of the &s;enate, were about to preponderate, and the tribunes &s;eemed he&s;itating, whether they &s;hould not withdraw their motion, when Marcus Tul|lius Cicero ro&s;e up to &s;econd the law, and to pay his tribute of eloquence to the virtues of Pompey. It was the fir&s;t time that this orator had ever addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly of the people, but it was impo&s;&s;ible but that eloquence mu&s;t have been irre&s;i&s;table then, which to this day conti|nues to charm and improve po&s;terity. The law pa&s;&s;ed with little oppo&s;ition, the decree was confirmed by all the tribes of the people, and Pompey was thus peaceably inve&s;ted with as great power, as Sylla had forced him&s;elf into through infinite difficulties.</P>
<P>Pompey being thus appointed to the com|mand of the war again&s;t Mithridates, immedi|ately departed for A&s;ia, having made the proper preparations towards forwarding the campaign. The war again&s;t this monarch was one of the mo&s;t important that had been hitherto under|taken
<PB N="396" REF="407">
by the Romans. We do not on this oc|ca&s;ion, read of princes already overcome by luxury and pride, or trembling at the &s;plendor of the Roman name, but of a mighty king, un|daunted in every &s;tage of his fortune, and like a lion, gaining new courage from every wound. His dominions were in fact well &s;ituated for &s;upport|ing a war again&s;t an invading enemy. They bor|dered on the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of Mount Cauca&s;us, who&s;e &s;avage inhabitants he could bring into the field; they extended thence along the &s;ea of Pontus, which he covered with his &s;hips: be&s;ides he was rich, and ever purcha&s;ing new armies among the Scythians, a people of invincible bravery. I have already mentioned the re&s;i&s;tance he made again&s;t Sylla, and the peace which that general forced him to accept: this however, being the effects of compul&s;ion, la&s;ted no longer, than while there were forces &s;trong enough to compel him to its ob&s;ervance. Murena, whom Sylla had left behind, attempting to reduce him to obedience, only met with di&s;|grace, and at la&s;t, a total overthrow. Some <MILESTONE N="680"> time after, Mithridates having procured the al|liance of Tigranes, king of Armenia, invaded the kingdom of Bythinia, which he had been formerly obliged to re&s;ign, and which had been lately bequeathed to the Romans by Nicome|des, the king of the country. To &s;top the pro|gre&s;s of the&s;e conque&s;ts, Lucullus, an experienced
<PB N="397" REF="408">
general, had been &s;ent from Rome, and upon his arrival, an engagement en&s;ued, in which Mi|thridates lo&s;t his whole army, and being obliged to e&s;cape by &s;ea, was very near falling into the hands of the enemy, had he not been taken up by a pyrate, who landed him &s;afe in his own dominions. No way intimidated by the&s;e di&s;a&s;|ters, he &s;oon rai&s;ed another army, and in the be|ginning gained &s;ome advantages over the enemy. But Lucullus &s;oon after cut off all his internal re|&s;ources, and forced him to take &s;helter in the court of Tigranes, king of Armenia. The Roman general followed him thither al&s;o, and demand|ed him up; but Tigranes, though with no par|ticular attachment to the depo&s;ed king, refu&s;ed to deliver him, becau&s;e Lucullus had omitted giving him all his titles. Pride, it &s;eems, was the reigning pa&s;&s;ion of this weak monarch; he was more de&s;irous of receiving homage, than of procuring power: it was u&s;ual with him, to oblige the kings he had conquered to attend him as &s;laves, when he appeared in public, having a&s;&s;umed, from his &s;ucce&s;&s;es over the weaker &s;tates around him, the title of monarch of all monarchies. This, it &s;eems, was the title the Roman general di&s;dained granting him: the war now therefore changing its object, the generals of Tigranes were at fir&s;t ea&s;ily overcome, and though he &s;oon after engaged at the head of two hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, yet he
<PB N="398" REF="409">
met with no better &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e victories pro|mi&s;ed a &s;peedy end to the war, which had now been protracted for &s;even years, and though the conduct of it was once more devolved upon Mithridates, yet he being pre&s;&s;ed as much as ever, was obliged to take refuge in Le&s;&s;er Ar|menia. Thither Lucullus was preparing to fol|low him, when accounts came, that Glabrio, who had been con&s;ul for the la&s;t year, was ap|pointed to di&s;place Lucullus in his command, and was actually arrived in A&s;ia for that purpo&s;e. This di&s;grace it &s;eems was owing to the intrigues of &s;ome of Lucullus's own &s;oldiers, who har|ra&s;&s;ed by perpetual fatigues, and debauched by factious officers, had privately &s;ent their com|plaints to the &s;enate; wherefore, upon Glabrio's arrival, the whole army abandonned Lucullus, who could not &s;ee without indignation, their common enemy Mithridates re&s;ume all his power, and recover the whole kingdom of Pontus, while Glabrio, te&s;tifying no inclination to enter upon a trouble&s;ome command, conti|nued an idle &s;pectator of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and cho&s;e to &s;top &s;hort in Bythinia. This mutinous &s;pirit the troops of Lucullus, and the little in|clination Glabrio &s;eemed to have of engaging, gave ri&s;e to that general de&s;ire which prevailed, of appointing Pompey to terminate the war, who &s;hortly after went over into A&s;ia for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="410">
The fir&s;t duty which he thought incumbent upon him on his arrival, was to propo&s;e terms of accommodation to Mithridates, but this mo|narch having a little re&s;pired from his great and numerous lo&s;&s;es, determined to tempt his fortune while it &s;eemed propitious. He had found means to collect a very con&s;iderable army from the wrecks of his former power, and was re|&s;olved to follow the Romans into Armenia, where he expected to cut off their &s;upplies: but being di&s;appointed in this, he was obliged to fly, having fir&s;t killed all &s;uch as were not able to accompany him in his retreat: however, he was pur&s;ued with great diligence by Pompey, and overtaken before he could have time to pa&s;s the river Euphrates: though it was then night, being compelled to engage, it is &s;aid, that the moon &s;hining from behind the Roman army, lengthening their &s;hadows &s;o much, that the archers of Mithridates &s;hot their arrows at the&s;e, mi&s;taking the &s;hade for the &s;ub&s;tance. How|ever that be, his A&s;iatic &s;oldiers were unable to with&s;tand the force of the European infantry; he did all that lay in the power of a great and expe|rienced general, to lead them on to the charge and to prevent their terrors, but they could not be brought to endure the &s;hock, cowardice and effe|m nacy having been then, as well as now, the characteri&s;tics of an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tern army. Being thus again overthrown, with the lo&s;s of almo&s;t all his
<PB N="400" REF="411">
forces, and finding him&s;elf hemmed in on every &s;ide by the Romans, he made a de&s;perate effort, at the head of eight hundred hor&s;e, to break through them, and thus effected his e&s;cape, though with the lo&s;s of five hundred of his fol|lowers in the attempt. He had long been ac|quainted with di&s;tre&s;s, but his pre&s;ent &s;ituation &s;eemed more deplorable than ever: he continued for &s;everal days &s;orrowfully wandering through the fore&s;ts that covered the country, leading his hor&s;e in his hand, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on whatever fruits he accidentally found on his way: in this forlorn &s;ituation he met with about three thou&s;and of his &s;oldiers who had e&s;caped from the general carnage, and by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was conduct|ed to one of the magazines, where he had de|po&s;ited tho&s;e trea&s;ures that were intended to &s;upport the war. He &s;ent from thence to Ti|granes for aid, but that monarch was too much engaged in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the rebellion of one of his own &s;ons at home, to be able to &s;end any &s;uccours abroad. Di&s;appointed on that &s;ide, &s;till however, he would not de&s;pair, but fled to Col|chis, a &s;tate which had formerly acknowledged his power. Being pur&s;ued thither al&s;o by Pom|pey, he took another dreadful journey, cro&s;&s;ed the Araxes, marched from danger to danger, through the country of the Lazi, and a&s;&s;em|bling all the barbarians he met with in his way, induced the Scythian princes to declare again&s;t
<PB N="401" REF="412">
Rome&punc; Stedfa&s;t in his enmity, he continued his oppo&s;ition, even though he found his own family confederating again&s;t him. Although betrayed by his &s;on Macharis, and tho' his life was attempted by Pharnaces, yet he &s;till aimed at great de&s;igns, and even in the heart of A&s;ia, projected the inva&s;ion of the Roman empire: this he intended to effect by marching into Eu|rope, and there being joined by the fierce na|tions that inhabited Germany and Gaul, to cro&s;s the Alps, into Italy, as Hannibal had done before him: but his timid A&s;iatic &s;oldiers were ill-di&s;po&s;ed to &s;econd the great views of their leader. Upon being apprized of his in|tentions, a mutiny en&s;ued, which was promoted by his &s;on Pharnaces, who had been long de&s;irous of gaining the favour of Pompey by parricide. Mithridates being thus obliged to take refuge in his palace, to e&s;cape the fury of the army, &s;ent to his &s;on for leave to depart, offering him the free po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that remained of his wretched fortunes, and his title to tho&s;e dominions, of which he had been deprived by the Romans. To this, the unnatural &s;on made no direct reply, con&s;cious that he was offered only what could not be taken away, but turning to the &s;lave that brought him theme&s;&s;age, he bade him, with a &s;tern countenance, tell his father, that death was all that now remained for him. Such an horrid in&s;tance of filial impiety added new
<PB N="402" REF="413">
poignance to the wretched monarch's afflic|tion, he could not refrain from venting his im|precations, and from wi&s;hing that &s;uch an unnatu|ral child might, one day, meet with &s;imilar ingra|titude from his own children. Upon this, com|ing down from his own appartment, where he had been for &s;ome time alone, he entered that particularly a&s;&s;igned to his wives, children and dome&s;tics, where he bid all tho&s;e prepare for death, who did not chu&s;e to undergo the hor|rors of a Roman captivity. They all readily con&s;ented to die with their monarch, and chear|fully taking the poi&s;on which he had in readi|ne&s;s, expired before him. As for him&s;elf, hav|ing u&s;ed his body much to antidotes, the poi&s;on had but little effect, whereupon he attempted to di&s;patch him&s;elf with his &s;word, but that al&s;o failing, a Gauli&s;h &s;oldier, who&s;e name was Bi|taeus, performed this friendly office. Thus died Mithridates, betrayed by his &s;on, and for&s;aken by an army that &s;eemed terrified at the greatne&s;s of his enterprizes. His fortune was various, his courage always the &s;ame: he had for twenty|five years oppo&s;ed Rome, and though he was often betrayed by his captains, his children, and his wives, yet he continually found re&s;ources again&s;t his enemies, and was formidable to the very la&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Pompey was diligently employed in pur&s;uing his advantages over Ti|granes,
<PB N="403" REF="414">
who had not only to re&s;i&s;t the Romans, but his own three &s;ons that had united in rebel|lion again&s;t him. Two of the&s;e he had the for|tune to overthrow, and put to death, but he was &s;oon after compelled by Pompey to &s;urrender. His remaining &s;on, who had taken refuge in the Roman camp, did all that lay in his power to prevent a reconciliation, but Pompey repri|manding his di&s;obedience, treated the old king with great humanity, and re&s;tored him the greate&s;t part of his former dominions, only depriving him of his conque&s;ts, and fining him &s;ix thou&s;and ta|lents towards defraying the expences of the war. His &s;on continuing &s;till aver&s;e to the treaty, and threatening his father's life, was confined by the general's command, in order to be re&s;erved for his triumph into Rome. Nothing now there|fore being able to check the progre&s;s of Pompey's arms, he marched onward, over the va&s;t moun|tains of Taurus, &s;etting up and depo&s;ing kings at plea&s;ure. Darius the king of Media, and Antiochus king of Syria, were compelled to &s;ubmit to his clemency; Phraates king of Par|thia, was obliged to retire, and &s;end to entreat a peace. From thence, extending his conque&s;ts over the Thuraeans and Arabians, he reduced all Syria and Pontus into Roman provinces. Then turning towards Judea, he &s;ummoned Ari&s;tobulus, who had u&s;urped the prie&s;thood from his elder brother Hyrcanus, to appear be|fore
<PB N="404" REF="415">
him: but Ari&s;tobulus had fortified the temple of Jeru&s;alem again&s;t him, and refu&s;ed to an&s;wer. This venerable place, which was thus converted into a garri&s;on, being very &s;trong from its &s;ituation, held out for three months, but was at la&s;t taken, and twelve thou&s;and of its defenders &s;lain. Pompey en|tered this great &s;anctuary with a mixture of re|&s;olution and fear; he &s;hewed an eager curio&s;ity to enter into the Holy of Holies: there he gazed for &s;ome time upon tho&s;e things which it was unlawful for any but the prie&s;ts them&s;elves to behold. Notwith&s;tanding he &s;hewed &s;o much veneration for the place, that he forbore touch|ing any of the va&s;t trea&s;ures depo&s;ited there. After re&s;toring Hyrcanus to the prie&s;thood and government, he took Ari&s;tobulus with him, to grace his triumph upon his return. This tri|umph, which la&s;ted two days, was the mo&s;t &s;plendid that had ever entered the gates of Rome: therein were expo&s;ed the names of fif|teen conquered kingdoms, eight hundred cities taken, twenty-nine repeopled, and a thou&s;and ca&s;tles brought to acknowledge the empire of Rome. Among the pri&s;oners led in triumph, appeared the &s;on of Tigranes, Ari&s;tobulus king of Judea, the &s;i&s;ter of Mithridates, together with the ho&s;tages of the Albanians, Iberians, and the king of Comagena. The trea&s;ures that were brought home, amounted to near four

millions of our money, and the trophies and other &s;plendors of the proce&s;&s;ion were &s;uch, that the &s;pectators &s;eemed lo&s;t in the magnifi|cent profu&s;ion. All the&s;e victories however, rather &s;erved to heighten the glory, than to en|crea&s;e the power of Rome, they only made it a more glaring object of ambition, and expo&s;ed its liberties to greater danger. Tho&s;e liberties indeed, &s;eemed devoted to ruin on every &s;ide, for even while Pompey was pur&s;uing his con|que&s;ts abroad, Rome was at the verge of ruin, from a con&s;piracy at home.</P>
<P>This con&s;piracy was projected and carried on by Sergius Catiline, a patrician by birth, who re&s;olved to build his own power on the downfal of his country. He was &s;ingularly formed both by art and nature to conduct a con&s;piracy: he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage, equal to the mo&s;t de&s;|perate attempts, and eloquence to give a colour to his ambition: ruined in his fortunes, profli|gate in his manners, and vigilant in pur&s;uing his aims: he was in&s;atiable after wealth, only with a view to lavi&s;h it in his guilty plea&s;ures: in &s;hort, as Cicero de&s;cribes him, he was a com|pound of oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions, intemperate to ex|ce&s;s, yet patient of labour to a wonder; &s;evere with the virtuous, debauched with the gay, &s;o that he had all the vicious for his friends by in|clination, and he attached even &s;ome of the good, by the &s;pecious &s;hew of pretended virtue.
<PB N="406" REF="417">
However, his real character was at length very well known at Rome; he had been accu&s;ed of debauching a ve&s;tal virgin; he was &s;u&s;pected of murdering his &s;on, to gratify a criminal pa&s;&s;ion; and it was notorious, that in the pro&s;cription of Sylla, he had killed his own brother, to make his court to the tyrant.</P>
<P>Catiline having contracted many debts by the loo&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch an ill-&s;pent life, was re&s;olved to extricate him&s;elf from them by any means however unlawful: his fir&s;t aim therefore was at the con&s;ul&s;hip, in which he hoped to repair his &s;hattered fortune, by the plunder of the pro|vinces, but in this he was fru&s;trated. This di&s;|grace &s;o operated upon a mind naturally warm, that he in&s;tantly entered into an a&s;&s;ociation with Pi&s;o and &s;ome others, of de&s;perate fortunes like him&s;elf, in which it was re&s;olved to kill the con&s;uls that had been ju&s;t cho&s;en, with &s;everal other &s;enators, and to &s;hare the government among them&s;elves. The&s;e de&s;igns however, were di&s;covered before they were ripe for action, and the &s;enate took care to obviate their effects. Some time after, he again &s;ued for the con&s;ul|&s;hip, and was again di&s;appointed; the great Cicero, who&s;e character will be given hereafter, being preferred before him. Enraged at the&s;e repeated mortifications, he now breathed no|thing but revenge: his de&s;ign was, had he then obtained the con&s;ul&s;hip, and with it the com|mand
<PB N="407" REF="418">
of the armies of the empire, to have &s;eized upon the liberties of his country, and go|verned alone. At length, impatience under his di&s;appointments would not permit him to wait for the ripening of his &s;chemes, wherefore he formed the mad re&s;olution of u&s;urping the em|pire, though yet without means adequate to the execution.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e who were in the former con|&s;piracy of Pi&s;o, &s;till remained attached to his intere&s;ts: the&s;e he a&s;&s;embled to about the num|ber of thirty, where he informed them of his aims and his hopes, &s;ettled a plan of opera|tions, and fixed a day for the execution. It was re&s;olved among them, that a general in&s;ur|rection &s;hould be rai&s;ed throughout Italy, the different parts of which were a&s;&s;igned to the different leaders. Rome was to be fired in &s;e|veral places at once; and Catiline, at the head of an army rai&s;ed in Etruria, was in the general confu&s;ion to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the city, and ma&s;&s;acre all the &s;enators. Lentulus, one of his profligate a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who had been praetor or judge in the city, was to pre&s;ide in their general councils: Cethegus, a man who &s;acrificed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great pre&s;ent power, to the hopes of gratifying his revenge again&s;t Cicero, was to direct the ma&s;&s;acre through the city, and Ca&s;&s;ius was to conduct tho&s;e who fired it. But the vigilance of Cicero being a chief ob&s;tacle
<PB N="408" REF="419">
to their de&s;igns, Catiline was very de&s;irous to &s;ee him taken off before he left Rome; upon which, two knights of the company undertook to kill him the next morning in his bed, in an early vi&s;it on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s. The meet|ing however, was no &s;ooner over, than Cicero had information of all that pa&s;&s;ed in it, for by the intrigues of a woman, named Fulvia, he had gained over Curius, her lover and one of the con&s;pirators, to &s;end him a punctual account of all their deliberations. Having taken proper precautions to guard him&s;elf again&s;t the de&s;igns of his morning vi&s;itors, who were punctual to the appointment; he next took care to provide for the defence of the city, and a&s;&s;embling the &s;enate, con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to be done in this time of danger. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken, was to offer con&s;iderable rewards for farther di&s;co|veries, and then to prepare for the defence of the &s;tate. Catiline, to &s;hew how well he could di&s;&s;emble or ju&s;tify any crime, went boldly to the &s;enate, declaring his innocence, and offering to give any &s;ecurity for his behaviour. The&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions, urged with an apparent humility, gain|ed over many of the Roman &s;enators, but Ci|cero incen&s;ed at his effrontery, in&s;tead of pur|&s;uing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, ro&s;e up, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Catiline, broke out into a mo&s;t &s;evere invective again&s;t him. The &s;peech is &s;till remaining in which, with all the fire of
<PB N="409" REF="420">
incen&s;ed eloquence, he lays open the whole cour&s;e of his crimes, and the particulars of his pre&s;ent impeachment. When Cicero was &s;eated, Catiline ro&s;e in his turn, and with well prepared di&s;&s;imulation, and a dejected countenance, be|&s;ought the &s;enate not over ra&s;hly to credit vain reports concerning him, nor believe, that a per&s;on of his rank, who&s;e ance&s;tors, and who&s;e &s;ervices demanded rather fame than cen&s;ure, could be guilty of &s;uch vile imputations. While he was continuing his defence, and beginning to introduce &s;ome reflections again&s;t the con&s;ul, the chief of which was the ob&s;curity of his original, the &s;enate refu&s;ed to hear him; whereupon he declared aloud, that &s;ince he was denied a vin|dication of him&s;elf, and driven headlong by his enemies, he would extingui&s;h the flame which was rai&s;ed about him, in univer&s;al ruin: thus &s;aying, he ru&s;hed out of the a&s;&s;embly, threaten|ing de&s;truction to all his oppo&s;ers. As &s;oon as he was returned to his hou&s;e, and began to re|flect on what had pa&s;&s;ed, he perceived it vain to di&s;&s;emble any longer; wherefore, re&s;olving to enter at once into action, before the com|monwealth was prepared to oppo&s;e him, after a &s;hort conference with Lentulus and Cethegus, he left Rome by night with a &s;mall retinue, to make the be&s;t of his way towards Etruria, were Manlius, one of the con&s;pirators was rai&s;|ing an army to &s;upport him.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="421">
In the mean time, Cicero took proper pre|cautions to &s;ecure all tho&s;e of the con&s;piracy who remained in Rome, and induced the peo|ple by the power of his eloquence to &s;econd his de&s;igns. Lentulus, Cethegus, Cae&s;ius and &s;e|veral others were put in confinement, and it was propounded to the &s;enate, what cour&s;e &s;hould be taken with the pri&s;oners. The prin|cipal evidences again&s;t them were the amba&s;&s;a|dors of the Allobroges, a fierce people inhabit|ing the countries now called Dauphiny and Sa|voy, who depo&s;ed, that they had been applied to, to furni&s;h a body of hor&s;e whenever the war &s;hould begin, but that being apprehen&s;ive of the danger, they had declined the propo&s;al, at the &s;ame time producing the letters of Lentulus to them for that purpo&s;e, marked with his own &s;eal. Upon this, a great debate aro&s;e in the hou&s;e concerning the puni&s;hment of the pri&s;oners, a deliberation of great delicacy and impor|tance. Capital puni&s;hments were rare and even odious in Rome, while on the other hand, the crimes of which they were convicted, required a quick and exemplary puni&s;hment. Silanus, the en&s;uing year's con&s;ul, was of opinion, that they &s;hould all be put to death; to this, all who &s;poke after him readily a&s;&s;ented, till it came to Julius Cae&s;ar's turn to deliver his opi|nion. This extraordinary man, who was cho|&s;en praetor for the en&s;uing year, had from the
<PB N="411" REF="422">
very beginning of his life marked out a way to univer&s;al empire, and now thought, that a &s;hew of clemency upon this occa&s;ion, would conci|liate the favour of the people. It is &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o by &s;ome, that he &s;ecretly favoured the con|&s;piracy, and only waited for its fir&s;t fortunes, to put him&s;elf at its head. He therefore ob&s;erved, in an elegant and elaborate &s;peech (for of all orators in the commonwealth, Cicero alone ex|celled him) that tho&s;e who opined for death, were on the merciful &s;ide, &s;ince death was but the relief of the mi&s;erable, and left no &s;en&s;e of good or ill beyond it. The heinou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent crime, he &s;aid, might ju&s;tify any &s;eve|rity, but the example was dangerous in a free &s;tate, where power &s;ometimes happened to fall into bad hands. Though no danger could be apprehended from &s;uch a con&s;ul as Cicero, yet in other times, and under other con&s;uls, none could tell how far ju&s;tice might &s;top &s;hort of cruelty: his opinion therefore, was that the con&s;pirators &s;hould be &s;entenced to perpetual confinement. His &s;peech, delivered with all the arts of a complete orator, &s;eemed to make great impre&s;&s;ion on the whole a&s;&s;embly: Silanus him&s;elf began to excu&s;e and mitigate the &s;everity of his former &s;entence, and even the friends of the con&s;ul were almo&s;t con|vinced, when Porcius Cato at la&s;t &s;tood up to oppo&s;e it: No two characters could be more oppo&s;ite, than his to that of the former &s;peaker.
<PB N="412" REF="423">
Cae&s;ar was merciful, gentle and in&s;inuating; Cato, &s;evere, forceful and overbearing; Cae&s;ar loved his country, in hopes one day to govern it; Cato loved it more than other countries, only becau&s;e he thought it more free: the one &s;crupled no means, however illicit, to attain his ends; the other laboured but to one end, by one way, the mo&s;t exalted ju&s;tice conducting him to the mo&s;t inflexible virtue. In fact, the opinions of the Greek philo&s;ophers began to give a bent to the di&s;po&s;itions of the great men of the time, &s;o that Cae&s;ar was a follower of Epicurus, and Cato was a rigid &s;toic. He be|gan therefore, by de&s;cribing Cicero as he really was, a man dignified with almo&s;t every virtue conducive to his own happine&s;s, together with all the talents that could improve happine&s;s in others. He proceeded, by wondering how any debate could ari&s;e about puni&s;hing men, who had begun an actual war upon their country: that he had never pardoned in him&s;elf, the very wanderings of his heart, and could not ea&s;ily forgive the mo&s;t flagitious actions in others: that they were not deliberating on the fate of the pri&s;oners only, but on that of Catiline's whole army, which would be animated or de|jected, in proportion to the vigour of their de|crees: wherefore his opinion was, &s;ince the cri|minals had been convicted both by te&s;timony and their own confe&s;&s;ion, that they &s;hould &s;uffer
<PB N="413" REF="424">
death, according to the cu&s;tom of their ance&s;|tors, in circum&s;tances of the like nature. His &s;peech was &s;econded by another, &s;till more forceful, from Cicero, and the&s;e carried &s;uch conviction, that they put an end to the debate. The vote for the death of the con&s;pirators was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, than Cicero re&s;olved to put it in execution, le&s;t the night, which was com|ing on, &s;hould produce any new di&s;turbance. Lentulus, Cethegus, and the re&s;t, were therefore taken from their re&s;pective &s;ureties, and con|ducted by the chief magi&s;trates, who delivered them over to the executioners, who pre&s;ently &s;trangled them in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Catiline had rai&s;ed an army of twelve thou&s;and men, of which a fourth part only was compleatly armed, the re&s;t begin furni&s;hed with what chance afforded, darts, lances and clubs. He refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to enli&s;t &s;laves, who flocked to him in great numbers, tru&s;ting to the proper &s;trength of the con&s;pi|racy; but upon the approach of the con&s;ul, who was &s;ent again&s;t him, and the arrival of the news, that his confederates were put to death in Rome, the face of his affairs was en|tirely altered. His fir&s;t attempt therefore, was by long marches, to make his e&s;cape over the Appennines into Gaul; but in this his hopes were di&s;appointed, all the pa&s;&s;es being &s;trictly guarded by an army under Metellus, &s;uperior
<PB N="414" REF="425">
to his own. Being thus hemmed in on every &s;ide, and &s;eeing all things de&s;perate, with no|thing left him, but either to die or conquer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e re&s;olved to make one vigorous effort again&s;t that army which pur&s;ued him. Antonius the con&s;ul being him&s;elf &s;ick, the command devolved upon his lieutenant, Petreius, who after a fierce and bloody action, in which he lo&s;t a con&s;iderable part of his be&s;t troops, de&s;troyed Catiline and his whole army, which fought de&s;perately to the la&s;t man: they all fell in the very ranks in which they &s;tood when alive, and as if in&s;pired with the &s;pirit of their leader, fought not &s;o much to conquer, as to &s;ell a bloody victory, and to mingle public calamity with their private ruin. The commonwealth being thus freed from their apprehen&s;ions of danger, unanimou&s;|ly concurred in their applau&s;es of Cicero, who&s;e councils had been the chief means of removing them. Public thanks were decreed him by the &s;enate, and at the in&s;tance of Cato, he was &s;tyl|ed the Father of his country, the people, with loud acclamations, confirming the ju&s;tice of the decree.</P>
<P>The extinction of this con&s;piracy &s;eemed only to leave an open theatre for the ambition of the great men of the &s;tate to di&s;play it&s;elf in. Pom|pey was now returned in triumph from conquer|ing the Ea&s;t, as he had before been victorious in Europe and Africa. Every eye was fixed
<PB N="415" REF="426">
upon him, as being the mo&s;t powerful man in the &s;tate, and capable of governing it at his plea&s;ure. His &s;ucce&s;s in war had procured him the &s;urname of Great, and he was &s;till more plea&s;ed with the title, than the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving it. This was the po&s;t his ambition aimed at, he &s;eemed more de&s;irous of being the leader, than the ruler of his country; of being applauded, than obeyed. He had it in his power often to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;tate by force, but he either declined the fatigue of it, or lived in perpetual expectation of receiving as a gift, what he did not chu&s;e to extort by vio|lence. His parts were &s;pecious, rather than pe|netrating, and his chief in&s;trument in govern|ing, was di&s;&s;imulation: but being a better &s;ol|dier than &s;tate&s;man, he was adored abroad, and gained in the camp that homage which was de|nied him at home.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he did upon his return, was to direct the election of both the con&s;uls, by who&s;e help he hoped he &s;hould readily obtain the ratification of all that he had di&s;po&s;ed of in A&s;ia, together with a di&s;tribution of lands to his &s;oldiers, of part of the countries they had conquered. However, he was di&s;appointed in both the&s;e expectations; the &s;enate, who began to &s;ee and dread his power, were de&s;irous of be|&s;ieging it by every oppo&s;ition. The two con&s;uls turned again&s;t him as well as the re&s;t, and were
<PB N="416" REF="427">
&s;econded by all tho&s;e who were not the profe&s;t in&s;truments of his party. The tribune Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vius, who was the promoter of the law, impatient of the delay, and animated by Pompey's power, had the hardine&s;s to commit Metellus the con|&s;ul to pri&s;on, and when all the &s;enate followed, and re&s;olved to go to pri&s;on with him, the tri|bune put his chair again&s;t the door to keep them out. This violence however, gave &s;uch offence to the people, that Pompey found it advi&s;eable to draw off the tribune, and relea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e the con&s;ul. From this oppo&s;ition in the &s;enate, he began to find, that his own intere&s;t alone, would not be &s;ufficient to rule the common|wealth, without taking in &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful men of the &s;tate, not as partners, to divide his power, but as in&s;truments to a&s;&s;i&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Cra&s;&s;us, as we have already ob&s;erved, was the riche&s;t man in Rome, and next him, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t authority: his party in the &s;enate was even &s;tronger than that of Pompey, his rival, and the envy rai&s;ed again&s;t him was le&s;s. He and Pompey had been long di&s;united by an oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, and of characters: however, it was from a continuance of their mutual jealou&s;ies, that the &s;tate was in &s;ome mea&s;ure to expect its future &s;afety. It was in this &s;ituation of things, that Julius Cae&s;ar, who had lately gone praetor into Spain, and had re|turned with great riches and glory, re&s;olved to
<PB N="417" REF="428">
convert their mutual jealou&s;y to his own ad|vantage. This celebrated man was nephew to Marius by the female line, and de&s;cend|ed from one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families in Rome: he had already mounted by the re|gular gradations of office, having been quae|&s;tor, aedile, and grand pontiff, and praetor in Spain. Being de&s;cended from popular ance&s;tors, he warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ide of the people, and &s;hortly after, the death of Sylla procured tho&s;e whom he had bani&s;hed to be recalled. He had all along declared for the populace again&s;t the &s;enate, and by this became their mo&s;t favourite magi&s;trate. He had received proper intelligence during his admini&s;tration in Spain, of what was going forward, and re&s;olved to return, to im|prove occurrences in his favour. His &s;ervices in Spain had de&s;erved a triumph, and his ambi|tion a&s;pired at the con&s;ul&s;hip. However, it was contrary to law for him to have both, for to obtain the con&s;ul&s;hip, he mu&s;t come into the city, and by entering the city, he was di&s;quali|fied for a triumph. In this dilemma, he pre|ferred &s;olid power to empty parade, and deter|mined to &s;tand for the con&s;ul&s;hip, at the &s;ame time, re&s;olving to attach the two mo&s;t power|ful men in the &s;tate to him, by effecting their reconciliation. He accordingly began fir&s;t, by offering his &s;ervices to Pompey, promi&s;ing him his aid in having all his acts pa&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="418" REF="429">
the &s;enate's oppo&s;ition. Pompey, plea&s;|ed at the acqui&s;ition of a per&s;on of &s;o much merit, readily granted him his confidence and protection. He next applied to Cra&s;&s;us, who from former connexions was di&s;po&s;ed to become &s;till more nearly his friend: at length, finding neither aver&s;e to an union of intere&s;ts, he took an opportunity of bringing them together; and remon&s;trating to them the advantage, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity of a re|conciliation, had art enough to per&s;uade them to forget former animo&s;ities. A combination was thus formed, by which they agreed, that nothing &s;hould be done in the commonwealth, but what received their mutual concurrence and approbation. This was called the fir&s;t Triumvirate, by which we find the con&s;titution weakened by a new intere&s;t, that had not hi|therto taken place in the government, very dif|ferent from that either of the &s;enate or the people, and yet dependant on both. A power like this however, as it depended upon the nice conduct of different intere&s;ts, could not be of long continuance, and in fact, it was &s;oon after &s;wallowed up in the military power, which took away even the &s;hadow of liberty.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t thing Cae&s;ar did, upon being taken into the triumvirate, was to avail him&s;elf of the intere&s;t of his confederates to obtain the con&s;ul&s;hip. The &s;enate had &s;till &s;ome &s;mall in|fluence
<PB N="420" REF="431">
left, and though they were obliged to chu&s;e him, yet they gave him for a colleague, one Bibulus, who they &s;uppo&s;od would be a check upon his power: but the oppo&s;ition was too &s;trong, for even &s;uperior abilities to re&s;i&s;t it, &s;o that Bibulus, after a &s;light attempt in favour of the &s;enate, remained inactive the &s;ucceeding part of the year. Cae&s;ar however, was by no means &s;o, but began his &s;chemes for empire, by ingratiating him&s;elf with the people. He pre|ferred a law for dividing certain lands in Cam|pania, among &s;uch of the poor citizens, as had at lea&s;t three children. This propo&s;al was ju&s;t enough in it&s;elf, and only criminal from the views of the propo&s;er. The &s;enate being re&s;olved to oppo&s;e him in all his &s;chemes, endeavoured to thwart him in this, which only &s;erved to ex|a&s;perate the people &s;till more again&s;t them&punc; The multitude drove them from the place of a&s;&s;embling with &s;tones: Cato and Bibulus, who were mo&s;t active again&s;t the law, were compelled to retire, and the re&s;t of the &s;enate were obliged to take an oath, to confirm the ob&s;ervance of it. During this &s;truggle, Pompey and Cra&s;&s;us became the dupes of their a&s;&s;ociate, driving the law forward with all their activity and intere&s;t: the former publickly declared, that if any would come (as he was informed they would) with &s;words to oppo&s;e it, he would be the fir&s;t to lift up his &s;hield in its defence.
<PB N="421" REF="432">
By this conduct he lo&s;t all his former influence in the &s;enate, while Cae&s;ar only gained all the popularity of a law, which was of his own propo&s;ing. From that time he acted entirely without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his colleague, &s;o that it was je&s;tingly called the con&s;ul&s;hip of Julius, and Cae&s;ar intimating, that all things were done only by him.</P>
<P>Having thus ingratiated him&s;elf with the people, his next &s;tep was to procure the favour of the knights, who made a very powerful body in the &s;tate. They had for many years been the the financers or farmers of the public revenue, and by that means had acquired va&s;t riches, however, they now began to complain of their inability to pay the &s;tipulated &s;ums into the trea&s;ury. Cae&s;ar therefore procured a law to abate a third part of their di&s;bur&s;ements, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the &s;enate. In this manner, having advanced his influence among the lower orders of the &s;tate, he deter|mined to attach Pompey &s;till more clo&s;ely to him, by giving him his daughter Julia in mar|riage, a woman with every accompli&s;hment that could tend to cement their confederacy.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;trengthened him&s;elf at home, he next deliberated with his confederates, about &s;haring the foreign provinces of the empire be|tween them. The partition was &s;oon made, Pompey cho&s;e Spain for his own part; for be|ing
<PB N="422" REF="433">
fatigued with conque&s;t, and &s;atiated with military fame, he was willing to take his plea|&s;ures at Rome; and there being no appearance of revolt in that province, he knew it could ea&s;ily be governed by his lieutenant. Cra&s;&s;us cho&s;e Sy|ria for his part of the empire, which province, as it had hitherto enriched the generals who had &s;ubdued it, would, he hoped, gratify him in this his mo&s;t favourite pur&s;uit. To Cae&s;ar was left the provinces of Gaul, compo&s;ed of many fierce and powerful nations, mo&s;t of them un&s;ubdued, and the re&s;t only profe&s;&s;ing a nominal &s;ubjection. Wherefore, as it was ra|ther appointing him to conquer than command, this government was granted him for five years, as if, by its continuance, to compen&s;ate for its dan|ger. Having thus divided the empire between them, they each of them prepared for their re&s;pec|tive de&s;tinations, but previous to Cae&s;ar's &s;etting out, there was &s;till an ob&s;tacle that &s;eemed to bla&s;t his aims, and which he wi&s;hed to have removed. This was Tullius Cicero, whom we have al|ready &s;een, by his penetration and eloquence, defeating the con&s;piracy of Catiline, and who &s;till continued a watchful guardian over the li|berties of Rome. This great orator and &s;tate&s;|man, or to give him an higher appellation &s;till, this excellent philo&s;opher had, from a very humble original, rai&s;ed him&s;elf into the fore|mo&s;t rank of the &s;tate: he was endowed with
<PB N="423" REF="434">
all the wi&s;dom and all the virtues that could adorn a man. However, his wi&s;dom, by di|recting his views over too wide a &s;phere, often overlooked tho&s;e advantages, which are clearly di&s;cerned by &s;hort-&s;ighted cunning, and his vir|tues, by being applauded by others, and receiv|ing his own con&s;cious approbation, enclined him to vanity. He &s;eemed, in his general con|duct, guilty of a fault too common with men of great abilities, a de&s;ire of uniting in him&s;elf incompatible qualities, which gave an air of ri|dicule to his greate&s;t actions. Thus, while he aimed at being the fir&s;t orator in the &s;tate, he was eager al&s;o to be thought the be&s;t je&s;ter; while he taught men to contemn vanity, he was &s;een earne&s;tly intriguing for the honour of a triumph, which however he had done nothing to merit. While no man &s;aw the corruptions of the times more clearly than he, yet he had hopes of governing &s;o corrupt a commonwealth without fraud. Thus, though he &s;aw through every per&s;on he conver&s;ed with, yet he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be the dupe of many, rather than recede from the rectitude of his aims. It was no wonder therefore, that Cae&s;ar was de&s;irous of expelling &s;uch a character from the republic, which was &s;o unlike his own: to effect this, he re&s;olved to take into his party Publius Clodius, a man of patrician birth, di&s;&s;olute manners, great popularity and an inveterate enemy of Cicero.
<PB N="424" REF="435">
Be&s;ides an oppo&s;ition of character, a principal cau&s;e of their enmity was, Cicero's having for|merly appeared again&s;t him upon his trial before the people, for an offence again&s;t the matrons of Rome, who&s;e my&s;teries he had intruded upon dre&s;&s;ed in woman's cloaths. He was at this time a tribune of the people, although he had been obliged to get him&s;elf adopted by a ple|beian, before he could obtain that office. The hopes of revenging him&s;elf upon Cicero, in &s;ome mea&s;ure incited him to &s;tand for it, and the concurrence of Cae&s;ar and Pompey with his preten&s;ions, &s;oon a&s;&s;ured him of &s;ucce&s;s. He therefore publickly began to accu&s;e Cicero, for having put the late con&s;pirators to death, who being citizens, ought to have been adjudged by the people. Cicero, terrified at this accu&s;ation, did all that lay in his power to oppo&s;e it. He applied to Cae&s;ar to take him as his lieutenant into Gaul, but Clodius had art enough to allure him from that de&s;ign, by pretending, that his re&s;entment was rather a matter of form than of revenge. Pompey too contributed to put him off his guard by a promi&s;e of protection, &s;o that the cunning of the&s;e men of moderate abi|lities was more than a match for the wi&s;dom of the philo&s;opher. Clodius having fir&s;t cau&s;ed a law to be enacted, importing, that any who had condemned a Roman citizen unheard, &s;hould him&s;elf be bani&s;hed, &s;oon after im|peached
<PB N="425" REF="436">
Cicero upon it. It was in vain that this great man went up and down the city, &s;o|liciting his cau&s;e in the habit of a &s;uppliant, and attended by many of the fir&s;t young noble|men whom he had taught the rules of elo|quence; tho&s;e powers of &s;peaking which had been &s;o often &s;ucce&s;sful in defending the cau&s;e of others, totally &s;eemed to for&s;ake him in his own; he was bani&s;hed by the votes of the people, four hundred miles from Italy; his hou&s;es were ordered to be demoli&s;hed, and his goods &s;et up to &s;ale. None now remained that could defend the part of the &s;enate but Cato, and he was &s;hortly after &s;ent into Cyprus, under pretence of doing him a favour, but in reality in order to leave an open theatre for the triumvirate to act in. Cae|&s;ar, during the&s;e intrigues, pretended to be an unconcerned &s;pectator, and to be wholly occu|pied in his preparations for going into Gaul. He in fact, left nothing undone, that might ad|vance the &s;peed, or encrea&s;e the &s;trength of this expedition; wherefore, leaving Pompey to guard their mutual intere&s;ts at home, he march|ed into his province at the head of four legions, that were granted him by the &s;enate, and two more that were lent him by his new a&s;&s;ociate in the empire.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible in the narrow compa&s;s which I have a&s;&s;igned my&s;elf, to enumerate all the battles Cae&s;ar fought, and the &s;tates he &s;ubdued,
<PB N="426" REF="437">
in his expeditions into Gaul and Britain, which continued eight years. He has him&s;elf given a detail of them in his Commentaries, a work which does as much honour to his abilities as a writer, as his conduct did to his talents as a general. To abridge &s;uch a work, is but to de|&s;troy it; to turn it into a dry catalogue of names, that cea&s;e to intere&s;t, and of battles that would appear to be all the &s;ame: it will be &s;ufficient ju&s;t to mention tho&s;e victories which a great and experienced general, at the head of a di&s;ciplined army, gained over the barbarous and tumultuary, though numerous forces, that were led to oppo&s;e him. The Helvetians were the fir&s;t that were brought into &s;ubjection, with the lo&s;s of near two hundred thou&s;and men; tho&s;e who remained after the carnage, were &s;ent by Cae&s;ar, in &s;afety to their fore&s;ts, from whence they had i&s;&s;ued. The Germans, with Ariovi&s;tus at their head, were next cut off, to the number of eighty thou&s;and, their monarch him&s;elf narrowly e&s;caping in a little boat acro&s;s the Rhine. The Belgae were cut off with &s;uch great &s;laughter, that mar&s;hes and deep rivers were rendered pa&s;&s;able from the heaps of &s;lain. The Nervians, who were the mo&s;t warlike of tho&s;e barbarous nations, made head for a &s;hort time, and fell upon the Romans with &s;uch fury, that their army was in danger of being utterly routed; but Cae&s;ar him&s;elf ha&s;tily catch|ing
<PB N="427" REF="438">
up a buckler, ru&s;hed through his army into the mid&s;t of the enemy, by which means, he &s;o turned the fate of the day, that the barba|rians were all cut off to a man. The Celtic Gauls, who were powerful at &s;ea, were next brought under &s;ubjection. After them, the Suevi, the Menapii, and all the nations from the Mediterranean to the Briti&s;h &s;ea. From thence, &s;timulated by the de&s;ire of conque&s;t, he cro&s;&s;ed over into Britain, upon pretence, that the natives had furni&s;hed his enemies with con|tinual &s;upplies. Upon approaching the &s;hores, he found them covered with men to oppo&s;e his landing, and his forces were in danger of be|ing driven back, till the &s;tandard-bearer of the tenth legion boldly leaped a&s;hore, and being well a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Cae&s;ar, the natives were put to flight. The Britons being terrified at Cae&s;ar's power, &s;ent to de&s;ire a peace, which was granted them, and &s;ome ho&s;tages delivered. A &s;torm however, &s;oon after de&s;troying great part of his fleet, they re&s;olved to take advantage of the di&s;a&s;ter, and marched again&s;t him with a pow|erful army. But what could a naked undi&s;ci|plined army do again&s;t forces that had been exerci&s;ed under the greate&s;t generals, and hard|ened by the conque&s;t of the greate&s;t part of the world. Being overthrown, they were obli|ged once more to &s;ue for peace, which Cae&s;ar granted them, and then returned to the conti|nent.
<PB N="428" REF="439">
But his ab&s;ence once more in&s;pired this people, naturally fond of liberty, with a re&s;olu|tion to di&s;claim the Roman power, wherefore, he re&s;olved upon a &s;econd expedition, where, by repeated victories, he &s;o intimidated their general Ca&s;&s;ibelanus, that he no longer attemp|ted to re&s;i&s;t him in the plains, but keeping in the fore&s;ts, attempted to protract the war. How|ever, Cae&s;ar pur&s;uing him clo&s;ely, and cro&s;&s;ing the Thames with his army, &s;o &s;traitened him, that he was obliged to &s;ubmit to the conque|ror's conditions, who impo&s;ed an annual tri|bute, and took ho&s;tages for the payment of it. Thus, in le&s;s than nine years, he conquered, together with Britain, all that country which extends from the Mediterranean to the German &s;ea. It is &s;aid, that in the&s;e expeditions, he took eight hundred cities, &s;ubdued three hun|dred different &s;tates, overcame three millions of men, one of which fell on the field of battle, and one was made pri&s;oners of war. The&s;e conque&s;ts, and this de&s;truction of mankind, may, in the pre&s;ent advancement of morals, be regarded with dete&s;tation, but they were regarded as the heighth of human virtue, at the time they were atchieved. In fact, if we examine Cae&s;ar's great a&s;&s;iduity in providing for his army, his great &s;kill in di&s;po&s;ing them for battle, and his amazing intrepidity during the engagement, we &s;hall not find a greater general in all anti|quity.
<PB N="429" REF="440">
But in one thing he excelled all, with inconte&s;tible &s;uperiority, namely, in his huma|nity to the vanqui&s;hed. This &s;eemed a virtue but little known to the times he lived in, &s;o that mankind were then more obliged to heroes, than they at pre&s;ent chu&s;e to confe&s;s; almo&s;t each of whom has introduced and given &s;anction to &s;ome new virtues, which philo&s;ophers&punc; might have &s;peculatively applauded before, but could never have influence to make popular, without &s;uch an example.</P>
<P>While Cae&s;ar was thus encrea&s;ing his reputa|tion and riches abroad, Pompey, who remained all the time in Rome, &s;teadily co-operated with his ambition, and advanced his intere&s;ts, while he vainly &s;uppo&s;ed he was forwarding his own. Upon the fir&s;t news of his great ex|ploits, he procured a decree of the &s;enate for a &s;olemn fe&s;tival of fifteen days, which was doing Cae&s;ar greater honour, than any ge|neral had received before him. When Cae&s;ar, after remaining in Gaul three years, pa&s;&s;ed over into Italy, to refre&s;h him&s;elf for a while from his fatigues, in order to renew the next cam|paign with greater vigour, Pompey, together with Cra&s;&s;us, took a journey from Rome to meet him: and there, when Cae&s;ar pleaded the ce&s;&s;ity of being continued in his command, his a&s;&s;ociates re&s;olved to endeavour at the con|&s;ul&s;hip for the next year, in order to keep him
<PB N="430" REF="441">
his province for five years longer. This de&s;ign was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to the &s;enate, and the di&s;&s;en|tions &s;o violent concerning it, that they went into mourning, as in a ca&s;e of public calamity. Cato did all that lay in his power to oppo&s;e their aims, declaring upon every occa&s;ion, that the liberty of Rome was in danger: he even procured one Domitius to offer him&s;elf a can|didate, again&s;t the intere&s;t of the whole tri|umvirate. Pompey however, knew how little the indignation of the &s;enate could avail again&s;t the power he was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, where|fore he &s;ent a body of armed men again&s;t Do|mitius, as he was going to offer him&s;elf at the election. The&s;e killed the &s;lave that preceded him, and then di&s;per&s;ed the company; Cato being wounded, and Domitius hardly e&s;caping with life. By this violence, Pompey becoming ma&s;ter of the &s;uffrages, he and Cra&s;&s;us were declared con&s;uls, and in con&s;equence of this promotion, Cae&s;ar was continued five years longer in Gaul; Cra&s;&s;us was appointed to Sy|ria, where, as we have &s;aid, he expected to reap an harve&s;t rather of wealth, than of glory; and Pompey was fixed in his government of Spain, which he governed wholly by his lieutenants, pretending that he could not leave Rome, be|cau&s;e of the general charge of provi&s;ions which was committed to his care; an office procured him by Cicero, who was lately recalled from
<PB N="431" REF="442">
bani&s;hment by his influence, the popularity of Clodius having given him &s;ome umbrage.</P>
<P>In this manner Pompey continued to dictate to the &s;enate, and to exerci&s;e his authority ra|ther than encrea&s;e it. But he began at la&s;t to be rouzed from his lethargy, by the ri&s;ing reputa|tion of Cae&s;ar. The fame of that great com|mander's valour, riches, and humanity, began &s;ecretly to give him pain, and to make him &s;uppo&s;e they began to eclip&s;e his own, for as being more recent, they were more talked of. He feared nothing &s;o much as an equal in point of glory, and yet by his own arts, he had rai&s;ed Cae&s;ar's &s;o high, that he was threatened with a &s;uperior. He now therefore began, by a change of the &s;ame arts, to do all that was in his power to dimini&s;h Cae&s;ar's reputation, obliging the magi&s;trates not to publi&s;h any letters they received from him, till he had dimini&s;hed the credit of them, by &s;preading di&s;advanta|geous reports. While every thing thus por|tended a repture between the&s;e principal men, accident contributed not a little to widen the &s;e|paration, by the death of Julia, Pompey's wife, who had not a little contributed to improve the harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. From this moment, Pompey re&s;olved to pur&s;ue his own particular advancement, and to depre&s;s that of one, whom he found, though too late,
<PB N="432" REF="443">
to &s;hare an equal degree of reputation with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, his efforts were now too late, Cae|&s;ar was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great &s;hare of popu|larity, which it had been the &s;tudy of his life to promote: he was loved almo&s;t to adoration by his army, who&s;e attachment he had gained by his humanity and great rewards: he &s;eemed to acquire immen&s;e riches, only to be&s;tow them upon the brave&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erving of his &s;oldiers, particularly tho&s;e who were worn out in his &s;ervice: he paid the debts of many of his officers, and gave them every motive to wean their love from the public, and to place it on their commander. Nor were his atten|tions fixed upon his &s;oldiers alone, but extend|ed to his partizans in the city; he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the&s;e, by promoting them to offices, lavi&s;hing large &s;ums of money to bribe their elections; he pil|laged the wealth of his provinces, to &s;pread it among the citizens of Rome, and gave even his rapine an air of genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>All this was frequently told Pompey, but he at fir&s;t wi&s;hed it true, then pretended to di&s;be|lieve it, and at la&s;t found, that he had commit|ted a fatal over&s;ight, but &s;uffered that con&s;i|deration to prevail as late as po&s;&s;ible. How|ever, he at length wi&s;hed to re&s;ume that power, which he had formerly &s;uffered others to &s;hare, and an opportunity &s;oon offered of obtaining
<PB N="433" REF="444">
his de&s;ire. As all elections had for many years <MILESTONE N="701" UNIT="U. C."> been carried on by &s;edition and bribery, there &s;eemed about that time to be a total ce&s;&s;ation of authority, no magi&s;trates having been elected for the &s;pace of eight months. This &s;tate of anarchy was heightened &s;till more by the death of Clo|dius, who was killed by Milo, in the country, as he was upon his return to town. As Clo|dius had been always a favourite of the people, his body was immediately brought to Rome, and expo&s;ed publickly to view. Nothing more was requi&s;ite to kindle a tumult, the multitude ran furiou&s;ly to Milo's hou&s;e, to &s;et it on fire, but being defended by his partizans, Milo re|pul&s;ed them with great &s;laughter. Upon this, returning to the dead body, they drew it to the &s;enate-hou&s;e, and there making a pile of the &s;eats of the magi&s;trates, con&s;umed both the body and that &s;tately building together. After this, the mutineers di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves all over the city, where, under pretence of &s;earching for Milo's friends, they committed the greate&s;t outrages that unlicen&s;ed fury could &s;ugge&s;t. Thus every &s;treet was filled with murders and quarrels, while none could walk from their own hou&s;es in &s;afety. In this univer&s;al tumult and di&s;traction, all eyes were turned upon Pom|pey, to re&s;tore tranquility, and give the &s;ufferers redre&s;s. Many were for creating him dictator, but Cato, unwilling to endanger the &s;tate by
<PB N="434" REF="445">
entru&s;ting the greate&s;t power to the mo&s;t noto|rious ambition, prevailed, that in&s;tead of being created dictator, he &s;hould be made Sole con&s;ul, which differed from the former office, but in this, that he was accountable for male-admini&s;tration, upon the re&s;ignation of his employment. In con&s;equence of this acce&s;&s;ion of power, a body of troops were allotted to him, a thou&s;and ta|lents were granted to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, the govern|ment of Spain was continued to him for four years longer, and Milo was accu&s;ed of having killed Clodius, and condemned to bani&s;hment, even though Cicero him&s;elf undertook to defend him. It &s;eems, the tribunal from whence he harrangued the populace, was &s;urrounded by the con&s;ul's &s;oldiers, &s;o that he was quite inti|midated, and unable to proceed with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity. Pompey who had hitherto acted alone, then took in Metellus for his colleague, who&s;e daughter Cornelia he had lately married, a woman of great merit and beauty, and by this new alliance, he &s;uppo&s;ed he had confirmed his former authority.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, who now began to be &s;en&s;ible of the jealou&s;ies of Pompey, took occa&s;ion, from the many honours which the latter had ju&s;t receiv|ed, to &s;ollicit for the con&s;ul&s;hip in his turn, with a prolongation of his government in Gaul, de|&s;irous of trying whether Pompey would thwart or promote his preten&s;ions. In this, Pompey
<PB N="435" REF="446">
&s;eemed to be quite inactive, but at the &s;ame time, privately employed two of his creatures, who alledged in the &s;enate, that the laws did not permit a per&s;on that was ab&s;ent, to offer him&s;elf as a candidate for that high office. Pompey's view in this was, to allure Cae&s;ar from his government, in order to &s;tand for the con&s;ul&s;hip in per&s;on. Cae&s;ar however, perceiv|ing his artifice, cho&s;e to remain in his province, convinced, that while he headed &s;uch an army as was now devoted to his intere&s;ts, he could, at any time, give laws as well as magi&s;trates to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, which were now devoted to Pom|pey, becau&s;e he had for &s;ome time attempted to defend them from the encroachments of the people, ordered the two legions which were in Cae&s;ar's army, belonging to Pompey, home, as it was pretended, to oppo&s;e the Parthians, but in reality, to dimini&s;h Cae&s;ar's power. Cae&s;ar ea&s;ily &s;aw their motive, but as his plans were not yet ready for execution, he &s;ent them home, in pur&s;uance of the orders of the &s;enate, having previou&s;ly attached the officers to him with be|nefits, and the &s;oldiers with a bounty. The next &s;tep the &s;enate took, was to recall Cae&s;ar from his government, as his time was now very near expiring. Every per&s;on perceived the dan|ger the &s;tate was in, from the continuance of his command over an army entirely devoted to
<PB N="436" REF="447">
his intere&s;ts, and become almo&s;t invincible by long experience. It was the general &s;en&s;e therefore of the hou&s;e, that Cae&s;ar &s;hould re|turn, and &s;ome went &s;o far, as to talk of bring|ing him to an account for the large &s;ums of money he had extorted from the provinces of Gaul. But Cae&s;ar was not without his friends in the &s;enate: among the re&s;t, Curio, who had lately been elected a tribune of the people, and had been bribed to his intere&s;ts, &s;ecretly favoured his cau&s;e. Curio was a man of &s;trong elo|quence, great re&s;olution, loaded with debts, and deeply engaged to Cae&s;ar, for extricating him from a part of them: he therefore pretended highly to approve the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;erted, that he could never think liberty &s;e|cure, while &s;uch armies were in readine&s;s to de&s;troy it, whenever their leaders &s;hould give the word of command: but then, he thought the chief &s;ecurity of the &s;tate depended upon the fear which the&s;e armies, whether in Spain, Gaul, or Italy, &s;tood in of each other. It was therefore his opinion, that Cae&s;ar &s;hould not leave his army, till Pompey had &s;et him the example. This was a propo&s;al, which Pompey had by no means been prepared for; his friends alledged, that his time was not yet expired, but this not &s;atisfying the tribune, Pompey him&s;elf ob&s;erved, that he had taken up his offices at the command of the &s;enate, and that he was
<PB N="437" REF="448">
ready to re&s;ign them, whenever his employers thought fit: that he knew Cae&s;ar, with who&s;e friend&s;hip and alliance he had been made happy, would not he&s;itate to do the &s;ame, when he knew the &s;enate had appointed him a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Curio, who &s;aw the art of Pompey, who&s;e only aim was to have a &s;ucce&s;&s;or actually nominated, replied, that in order to &s;hew the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, it was not enough to promi&s;e to give up his government, but at that very in&s;tant, to perform a thing he had it &s;o ea&s;ily in his power to do: he added, that both were too powerful, and that it was for the intere&s;t of the commonwealth, that they &s;hould return to their former privacy: he concluded with &s;aying, that there was no other method left for public &s;ecurity, but to order both to lay down their commands, and to declare him an enemy to his country, who &s;hould di&s;obey. Curio had made this propo&s;al, with a certainty of its be|ing rejected by Pompey, whom he knew to be too well acquainted with the advantages of command, and too confident of his own &s;upe|riority over Cae&s;ar, to begin the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: in fact, he judged very ju&s;tly. Pompey was ren|dered arrogant, not only by his long good for|tune, and his pre&s;ent honour, but al&s;o by accounts brought him continually from Cae&s;ar's army, importing, that his &s;oldiers had no e&s;teem for him, and that they would certainly for&s;ake
<PB N="438" REF="449">
him as &s;oon as they had croft the Alps, all which fal&s;ehoods, though merely invented to gain Pompey's favour by &s;uiting the account to his inclinations, he readily gave credit to. Nay, to &s;uch a pitch of &s;elf &s;ecurity did he at la&s;t make preten&s;ions, that when Cicero a&s;ked him what forces he had to repell Cae&s;ar, Pompey re|plied, that if he only &s;tamped with his foot, an army would &s;tart up from the ground to oppo&s;e him. Thus confidence at fir&s;t, and &s;hame &s;oon after to have been in the wrong, operated &s;o powerfully upon him, that he did not prepare for his defence, le&s;t he &s;hould be obliged to ac|knowledge him&s;elf in danger.</P>
<P>Curio having attained his aims in this parti|cular, di&s;mi&s;t the &s;enate, as he was impowered to do by his office, but Marcellus, who was con&s;ul, and a creature of Pompey, convoked it immediately after, and then put it to the vote whether Cae&s;ar &s;hould be continued in his go|vernment. The whole a&s;&s;embly were immediately of opinion that he &s;hould be di&s;continued. He then demanded their plea&s;ure as to Pompey's continuance in the government he enjoyed. The majority declared that it was proper to continue him. Curio then put a third que&s;tion, whether it would not be mo&s;t expedient to di&s;continue them both, to which three hundred and &s;ixty of the &s;enate a&s;&s;ented, and twenty two only declared again&s;t it. Marcellus being thus fru&s;tated in
<PB N="439" REF="450">
his views of obtaining the &s;anction of the &s;enate to continue Pompey in his government, could not contain his re&s;entment, but ri&s;ing in a rage, cried out, If you will have Cae&s;ar for your ma&s;|ter, why have him. Upon which one of his own party a&s;&s;erting, in order to intimidate the &s;enate &s;till more, that Cae&s;ar was pa&s;t the Alps, and marching with his whole army directly to|wards Rome, the con&s;ul immediately quitting the &s;enate, went with his colleague forth from the city to an hou&s;e where Pompey at that time re|&s;ided. He there pre&s;ented him with a &s;word, commanding him to march again&s;t Cae&s;ar, and fight in defence of the commonwealth. Pompey declared he was ready to obey, but with an air of pretended moderation added, that it was only in ca&s;e more gentle expedients could not be employed.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, who was in&s;tructed in all that pa&s;t by his partizans at Rome, though he was &s;till in Gaul, was willing to give his aims all the ap|pearance of ju&s;tice. He therefore wrote to the &s;enate &s;everal times, de&s;iring to be continued in his government of Gaul, as Pompey had been in that of Spain, or el&s;e that he &s;hould be per|mitted to &s;tand for the con&s;ul&s;hip and his ab|&s;ence di&s;pen&s;ed with. He agreed to lay down his employment when Pompey &s;hould do the &s;ame. But the &s;enate, who were devoted to his rival, rejected all his propo&s;itions, blindly confident
<PB N="440" REF="451">
of their own power, and relying on the a&s;&s;urances of Pompey. Cae&s;ar &s;till unwilling to come to an open rupture with the &s;tate, at la&s;t was content to a&s;k the government of Illyria, with two le|gions; but this al&s;o was refu&s;ed him; a fatal ob&s;tinacy had &s;eized the &s;enate, who were will|ing to &s;acrifice all his power to encrea&s;e that of their pre&s;ent favourite, &s;o that they attempted to repre&s;s his inju&s;tice by &s;till greater of their own. Wherefore Cae&s;ar now finding all hopes of an accommodation fruitle&s;s, and con&s;cious, if not of the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, at lea&s;t of the goodne&s;s of his troops, began to draw them down towards the confines of Italy, and pa&s;&s;ing the Alps with his third legion, &s;topt at Raven|ra, a city of Ci&s;alpine Gaul, from whence he once more wrote a letter to the con&s;uls, declaring that he was ready to re&s;ign all command in ca&s;e Pompey did &s;o too. But he added, that if all power was to be given to one only, he would endeavour to prevent &s;o unju&s;t a di&s;tribution, and declared that if they per&s;i&s;ted he would &s;hortly arrive in Rome to puni&s;h their inju&s;tice, and the wrongs of his country. The menaces contained in the la&s;t part of his letter, exa&s;perated the whole body of the &s;enate again&s;t him. Marcellus the con&s;ul, who as we have &s;aid, was the creature of Pompey, gave way to his rage, while Lentu|lus his colleague, who being of wrecked for|tune, could expect to lo&s;e nothing by a civil war,
<PB N="441" REF="452">
openly declared, that after &s;uch an in&s;ult further deliberation was needle&s;s, and that there was now more occa&s;ion for arms than for &s;uffrages. It was then after &s;ome oppo&s;ition, decreed that Cae&s;ar &s;hould lay down his government and di&s;|band his forces within a limited time, and if he refu&s;ed obedience, that he &s;hould be declared an enemy to the commonwealth. They next gave orders to the con&s;uls, that the common|wealth would receive no damage, which was the form of inve&s;ting them with ab&s;olute authority in ca&s;es of immediate danger. After this they appointed Domitius, a man of great courage and abilities, as Cae&s;ar's &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the govern|ment of Gaul. Pompey was ordered to put him&s;elf at the head of what troops were in rea|dine&s;s, and all tho&s;e who were under the influ|ence either of him or the &s;enate, prepared to take up arms at Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they who had declared them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;trongly in Cae&s;ar's intere&s;t, began to fear for them&s;elves, from the ab&s;olute power granted the con&s;uls of di&s;po&s;ing all things at their plea&s;ure, and of treating whom they would as enemies to the &s;tate. But parti|cularly Curio, with the two tribunes Marcus Antonius and Longinus, &s;uppo&s;ed they had rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive. They accordingly fled disgui&s;ed as &s;laves to Cae&s;ar's camp, de|ploring the inju&s;tice and tyranny of the &s;enate,
<PB N="442" REF="453">
and making a merit of their &s;ufferings in his cau&s;e. Cae&s;ar &s;hewed them in the habits which they had thus a&s;&s;umed to his army, and &s;eem|ing touched with the &s;tronge&s;t compa&s;&s;ion at their treatment, bur&s;t out into &s;evere invectives again&s;t the &s;enate, alledging their tyranny over the &s;tate, their cruelty to his friends, and their flagrant ingratitude to him&s;elf for all his pa&s;t &s;ervices. The&s;e cried he, pointing to the tri|bunes, who were in &s;laves habits, the&s;e are the rewards obtained by the faithful &s;ervants of their country, men who&s;e per&s;ons are &s;acred by their office, and who&s;e characters have been e&s;teemed for their virtues, are driven from their country, obliged for &s;afety to appear as the meane&s;t of mankind, to find protection only in a di&s;tant province of the empire, and all for maintaining the rights of freedom, tho&s;e rights which even Sylla in all the rage of &s;laughter dur&s;t not violate. All this he enforced with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate ge&s;tures, and accompanied his words with his tears. The &s;oldiers, as if in|&s;pired with one mind, cried out that they were prepared to follow him wherever he &s;hould lead, and were ready to die or revenge his in|juries. An univer&s;al acclamation rung through the whole camp, every man prepared for a new &s;ervice of danger, and forgetting the toils of ten former campaigns, went to his tent to meditate on future victory.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="454">
When the army was thus fit for his purpo&s;e, Cae&s;ar, at night-fall, &s;at down to table chearfully conver&s;ing with his friends on &s;ubjects of litera|ture and philo&s;ophy, and apparently di&s;engaged from every ambitious concern: however, after &s;ome time, ri&s;ing up, he de&s;ired the company to make them&s;elves chearful in his ab&s;ence, and that he would be with them in a moment: in the mean time having ordered his chariot to be prepared he immediately &s;et out, attended by a few friends, for Arminium, a city upon the confines of Italy, whither he had di&s;patched a part of his army the morning before. This journey by night, which was very fatiguing&punc; he performed with great diligence, &s;ometimes walking and &s;ometimes on hor&s;eback, 'till at the break of day he came up with his army, which con&s;i&s;ted of about five thou&s;and men, near the Rubicon, a little river which &s;eparates Italy from Gaul, and which terminated the li|mits of his command. The Romans had ever been taught to con&s;ider this river as the &s;acred boundary of their dome&s;tic empire; the &s;enate had long before made an edict, which is &s;till to be &s;een engraven in the road near Rimini, by which they &s;olemnly devoted to the infernal gods and branded with &s;acrilege and parricide any per&s;on who &s;hould pre&s;ume to pa&s;s the Ru|bicon with an army, a legion, or even a &s;ingle cohort: Cae&s;ar therefore when he advanced at
<PB N="444" REF="455">
the head of his army to the &s;ide of the river &s;topt &s;hort upon the bank, as if impre&s;t with terror at the greatne&s;s of his enterprize. The dangers he was to encounter, the &s;laughters that were to en&s;ue, the calamities of his native city, all pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to his imagination in gloomy per&s;pective, and &s;truck him with remor&s;e. He pondered for &s;ome time in fixt melancholy, looking upon the river and debating with him|&s;elf whether he &s;hould venture in: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If I pa&s;s this river, &s;ays he to one of his generals who &s;tood by him, what mi&s;eries &s;hall I bring upon my country! and if I now &s;top &s;hort I am undone."</Q> Thus &s;aying, and re&s;uming all his former alacrity, he plunged in, crying out that the die was ca&s;t and all was now over: his &s;oldiers followed him with equal prompti|tude, and quickly arriving at Arminium made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the place without any re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This unexpected enterprize excited the ut|mo&s;t terrors in Rome, every one imagining that Cae&s;ar was leading his army to lay the city in ruins. At one time were to be &s;een the citi|zens flying into the country for &s;afety, and the inhabitants of the country coming up to &s;eek for &s;helter in Rome. In this univer&s;al confu&s;ion Pompey felt all that repentance and &s;elf-con|demnation which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from the remembrance of having advanced his rival to
<PB N="445" REF="456">
his pre&s;ent pitch of power: wherever he ap|peared many of his former friends were ready to tax him with his &s;upinene&s;s, and &s;arca&s;ti|cally to reproach his ill-grounded pre&s;umption. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where is now, cried Favonius, a ridiculous &s;enator of his party, the army that is to ri&s;e at your command? let us &s;ee if it will appear by &s;tamping."</Q> Cato reminded him of the many warnings he had given him; which however, as he was continually boding nothing but calamities, Pompey might very ju&s;tly be excu&s;ed from attending to. But being at length wearied with the&s;e reproaches which were offer|ed under colour of advice, he did all that lay in his power to encourage and confirm his fol|lowers: he told them that they &s;hould not want an army, for that he would be their leader; he confe&s;t indeed that he had all along mi&s;taken Cae&s;ar's aims, judging of them only from what they ought to be; however, if his friends were &s;till in&s;pired with the love of freedom, they might yet enjoy it in whatever place their nece&s;&s;ities &s;hould happen to conduct them. He let them know that their affairs were in a very promi&s;ing &s;ituation; that his two lieutenants were at the head of a con&s;iderable army in Spain, compo&s;ed of veteran troops that had made the conque&s;t of the Ea&s;t; be|&s;ides the&s;e, there were infinite re&s;ources both in A&s;ia and Africa, together with the &s;uccours
<PB N="446" REF="457">
they were &s;ure to expect from all the kingdoms that were in alliance with Rome. This &s;peech &s;erved, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to revive the hopes of the confederacy. The greate&s;t part of the &s;enate, his own private friends and dependants, toge|ther with all tho&s;e who expected to make their fortunes in his cau&s;e, agreed to follow him. Thus being in no capacity of re&s;i&s;ting Cae&s;ar at Rome, he re&s;olved to lead his forces to Capua, where he had the two legions that com|manded under Cae&s;ar in Gaul. His parting from Rome was not a little di&s;tre&s;sful to the &s;pectators. Antient &s;enators, re&s;pectable magi|&s;trates, and many of the flower of the young no|bility, obliged thus to leave their native city de|fencele&s;s to the invader, rai&s;ed an univer&s;al con|cern in all ranks of people, who followed them &s;ome way with outcries, tears and wi&s;hes for their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, in the mean time, after having vain|ly attempted to bring Pompey to an accommo|dation, was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue him into Capua before he could have time to collect his forces. However, at the very out-&s;et, he was in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;couraged by the defection of Labi|enus, a&s;&s;ociate of all his former victories: this general, either di&s;gu&s;ted at his command or unwilling to de&s;olate his native country, went over to the other &s;ide; but Cae&s;ar, who was not to be intimidated by the lo&s;s of one
<PB N="447" REF="458">
man, who&s;e abilities he him&s;elf was able to re|place, did not &s;eem much to regard it; wherefore &s;ending all his money after him, he marched on to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cities that lay between him and his rival, not regarding Rome, which he knew would fall of cour&s;e to the conqueror. Corfinium was the fir&s;t city that attempted to &s;top the rapidity of his march. It was defend|ed by Domitius, who had been appointed by the &s;enate to &s;ucceed him in Gaul, and was garri|&s;oned by twenty cohorts which were levied in the countries adjacent: Cae&s;ar, however, quick|ly inve&s;ted it, and though Domitius &s;ent frequently to Pompey, exhorting him to come and rai&s;e the &s;iege, be was at la&s;t obliged to endeavour to e&s;cape privately. His inten|tions happening to be divulged, the garri|&s;on were re&s;olved to con&s;ult their own &s;afety by delivering him up to the be&s;iegers. Cae|&s;ar readily accepted their offers, but kept his men from immediately entering into the town. After &s;ome time Lentulus the con&s;ul, who was one of the be&s;ieged, came out to implore forgivene&s;s for him&s;elf and the re&s;t of his confederates, putting Cae&s;ar in mind of their ancient friend&s;hip and acknowledging the many favours he had received at his hands: to this Cae&s;ar, who would not wait the conclu|&s;ion of his &s;peech, generou&s;ly replied, that he came into Italy not to injure the liberties of
<PB N="448" REF="459">
Rome and it's citizens, but to re&s;tore them. This humane reply being quickly carried into the city, the &s;enators, and the knights, with their children and &s;ome officers of the garri&s;on, came out to claim the conqueror's protection, who ju&s;t glancing at their ingratitude gave them their liberty with permi&s;&s;ion to go where&s;oever they &s;hould think proper. But while he di&s;|mi&s;t the leaders, he, upon this, as upon all other occa&s;ions, took care to attach the common &s;ol|diers to his own intere&s;t, &s;en&s;ible that he might &s;tand in need of an army, but that while he lived his army could never &s;tand in need of a commander.</P>
<P>Pompey having intelligence of what pa&s;t upon this occa&s;ion immediately retreated to Brundu&s;i|um, where he re&s;olved to &s;tand a &s;iege to delay the enemy until the forces of the empire &s;hould be united to oppo&s;e him. Cae&s;ar, as he expected, &s;oon arrived before the place, and having acci|dentally taken one of Pompey's engineers a pri|&s;oner he gave him liberty, with orders to per|&s;uade his general that it might be for the inte|re&s;ts of both, as well as to the advantage of the empire to have an interview; but to this overture he received no return. He next attempted to block up the harbour, but in this being fru&s;|trated by the diligence of Pompey, he &s;ent ano|ther propo&s;al for having an interview, to which it was an&s;wered, that no propo&s;itions of that
<PB N="449" REF="460">
kind could be received in the ab&s;ence of the con&s;uls. Thus &s;eeing no hopes of concluding their di&s;agreements by treaty, he turned all his thoughts towards carrying on the war, which Pompey on his &s;ide re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute with all imaginable vigour.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t aim in keeping Cae&s;ar &s;ome time employed before Brundu&s;ium &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h; he at length therefore prepared, with all imaginable caution, to abandon the town, and tran&s;port his garri&s;on over to Dyrac|chium, where the con&s;uls, who had been &s;ent with a part of the troops before him, were le|vying men for the &s;ervice of the empire. For this purpo&s;e, having fortified the harbour in &s;uch a manner that the enemy could not ea&s;ily pur&s;ue him, he embarked his troops with the utmo&s;t &s;ilence and di&s;patch, leaving only a few archers and &s;lingers on the walls, who were ordered to retreat in &s;mall boats provided for that purpo&s;e, as &s;oon as all the heavy infantry were got on board. Cae&s;ar being apprized of their retreat by the inhabitants of the town, who were provoked at the ruin of their hou&s;es, immediately attempted to prevent the embar|kation, and was actually going to lead his men over a pitfall, which Pompey had &s;ecretly placed in his way, had he not been interrupted by the town&s;men, who apprized him of his danger. Thus did Pompey, with great &s;kill and dili|gence,
<PB N="450" REF="461">
make his e&s;cape, leaving the whole kingdom of Italy at the mercy of his rival, without either a town or an army that had &s;trength to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar finding he could not follow Pompey for want of &s;hipping, re&s;olved to go back to Rome, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public trea|&s;ures, which his opponent, by a mo&s;t unaccoun|table over &s;ight, had neglected taking with him. It might have been alledged, indeed, that as the&s;e trea&s;ures were con&s;idered as a &s;acred depo&s;it, and only to be u&s;ed in the la&s;t extremity, or in ca&s;e of a Gallic inva&s;ion, it would have been wrong in Pompey to begin his operations with an act of impiety. Thus it often happens that the weaker &s;ide, through a fear of di&s;crediting their cau&s;e by any thing irregular, ruin it by un&s;ea&s;o|nable moderation. Cae&s;ar was received at Rome with the repeated acclamations of the lower part of the citizens and by all his own party; tho&s;e of the &s;enate al&s;o who were attached to his intere&s;ts a&s;&s;embled to congratulate his arrival, to whom he made a plau&s;ible &s;peech, ju&s;tifying his conduct and profe&s;&s;ing his aver&s;ion to the violent mea|&s;ures to which he had been compelled. Then, under a pretence that his cau&s;e was that of ju&s;tice and of the commonwealth, he prepared to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of tho&s;e trea&s;ures which had been laid up for the u&s;es of the public: but upon his coming up to the door of the trea&s;ury, Me|tellus,
<PB N="451" REF="462">
the tribune, who guarded it, refu&s;ed to let him pa&s;s, alledging that the money was &s;a|cred, and that horrible imprecations had been denounced again&s;t &s;uch as touched it upon any occa&s;ion but that of a Gallic war. Cae&s;ar, howe|ver, was not to be intimidated by his &s;uper&s;titious remon&s;trances, ob&s;erving that there was no oc|ca&s;ion for money to carry on a Gallic war, as he had entirely &s;ubdued all Gaul already: the tribune then pretending that the keys were mi&s;&s;ing, Cae&s;ar ordered his attendants to break open the doors, but Metellus had &s;till the bold|ne&s;s to di&s;pute even this command, whereupon Cae&s;ar, with more than u&s;ual emotion, laying his hand upon his &s;word, threatened to &s;trike him dead; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And know, young man, cried he, that it is ea&s;ier to do this than to &s;ay it."</Q> This menace had it's effect; Metellus retired, and Cae&s;ar took out to the amount of three thou&s;and pound weight of gold, be&s;ides an im|men&s;e quantity of &s;ilver; which money was a principal means of promoting his &s;ucceeding conque&s;ts. Having thus provided for continu|ing the war, he departed from Rome, re&s;olved to &s;ubdue Pompey's lieutenants, Afranius and Petreius, who had been long in Spain at the head of a veteran army.</P>
<P>Much had been expected by the oppo&s;ite party from the army in Spain; it was compo&s;ed of the choice&s;t legions of the empire, and had
<PB N="452" REF="463">
been ever victorious under all its commanders&punc; Cae&s;ar however, who knew the abilities of its two pre&s;ent generals, joco&s;ely &s;aid as he was pre|paring to go thither, that he went to fight an army without a general, and upon conquering it would return to fight a general without an army. However it may be enquired why Cae&s;ar did not rather pur&s;ue Pompey directly, than thus &s;tep out of the way, as it were, into Spain, to engage his generals. He had good rea|&s;ons; he was &s;en&s;ible that if he had overcome Pompey and driven him out of Greece, where he was then making preparations, he mu&s;t pro|bably have forced him into Spain, where of all places he dreaded mo&s;t to meet him; it was there|fore prudent fir&s;t to de&s;troy the army there, and then there was little to be dreaded from the pro|tection it might afterwards afford. Accordingly having refre&s;hed his men, previous to their &s;etting out, he led them once more a long and fatiguing march acro&s;s the Alps, through the exten&s;ive provinces of Gaul, to meet the enemy in Spain. Indeed, when I con&s;ider the amazing length of the way, and the various countries his &s;oldiers were to pa&s;s, the mountains they had to a&s;cend, and the fore&s;ts to cut through, the various cli|mates they were to endure, and the military duties they were to undergo, while every centi|nel wore &s;eventy pounds weight of armour, that would be con&s;idered as a modern man's load,

while be&s;ides this each man was obliged to carry with him ten days provi&s;ion upon the point of his &s;pear, and was allowed nothing to drink but vinegar and water on the way, when I con|&s;ider, I &s;ay, the fatigues the&s;e mu&s;t have under|gone, and the length of their continuance, I am &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at their invincible patience and re&s;olution! Cae&s;ar having left one of his generals, with a part of the army, to be|&s;iege Mar&s;eilles, which refu&s;ed to admit him, he proceeded with extreme diligence on his march to Spain, and to attach his men more firmly to his intere&s;ts, borrowed money from all his officers, which he di&s;tributed among the &s;oldiers. Thus engaging the one to him by his liberality, and the other by the expectation of being repaid.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t conflict which he had with Afranius and Petreius, was rather unfavourable. It was fought near the city of Herda, and both &s;ides claimed the honour of the victory. Neverthe|le&s;s, it appeared &s;oon after that Cae&s;ar was re|duced to great &s;treights for want of provi&s;ions, which the overflowing of the river and the po|&s;ition of the enemy entirely cut off. However, nothing was able to &s;ubdue his dilligence and activity, for cau&s;ing &s;light boats covered with leather to be made, and cau&s;ing a divi&s;ion of the enemy to another part, he carried his boats in waggons twenty miles di&s;tant from the camp,
<PB N="454" REF="465">
launched them upon the broade&s;t part of the river, and with great dexterity cau&s;ed his legions to pa&s;s over. Having thus gained new &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and men, he made a feint as if he intended to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy in turn, by cutting off their &s;upplies, and for this purpo&s;e be began to throw up entrenchments and cut ditches, as if to turn the cour&s;e of the river into a different channel. The&s;e preparations &s;o intimidated the enemy, that they re&s;olved to decamp by night: but Cae&s;ar, who had intimation of their de&s;ign by his &s;pies, pur&s;ued them with a &s;mall part of his army, and forcing them to ford the river, before they had time to rally on the other &s;ide, ap|peared with the main body of his forces to receive them. Thus hemmed in on both &s;ides, they could neither get forward nor return to their former camp. By the&s;e means he reduced them to &s;uch extremity of hunger and drought, that they were obliged to yield at di&s;cretion. But cle|mency was his favourite virtue, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them all with the kinde&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, and &s;ent them home to Rome loaden with &s;hame and ob|ligations to publi&s;h his virtues, and confirm the affections of his adherents. Thus, in the &s;pace of about forty days, he became ma&s;ter of all Spain; and then departing to his army at Mar|&s;eilles, obliged that city to &s;urrender at di&s;cre|tion. He pardoned the inhabitants, as he &s;aid, chiefly upon account of their name and anti|quity;
<PB N="455" REF="466">
and leaving two legions in that garri&s;on, returned again victorious to Rome. The citi|zens upon this occa&s;ion received him with fre&s;h demon&s;trations of joy, they created him dictator and con&s;ul; but the fir&s;t of the&s;e offices he laid down after he had held it but eleven days. His de&s;ign in accepting it was probably to &s;hew the people with what readine&s;s he could re&s;ign it.</P>
<P>While Cae&s;ar was thus employed, Pompey was equally active in making preparations in Epirus and Greece to oppo&s;e him. All the mo|narchs of the Ea&s;t had declared in his favour, and &s;ent very large &s;upplies. He was ma&s;ter of nine effective Italian legions, and had a fleet of five hundred large &s;hips under the conduct of Bibulus, an active and experienced commander. Added to the&s;e, he was &s;upplied with large &s;ums of money and all the nece&s;&s;aries for an army, from the tributary provinces round him. He had attacked Dolabella and Anthony, who commanded for Cae&s;ar in that part of the empire, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the former was obliged to fly and the latter was taken pri&s;oner. Crowds of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed citizens and nobles from Rome came every day to join him. He had at one time above two hundred &s;ena|tors in his camp&punc; among whom were Cicero and Cato, who&s;e approbation of his cau&s;e was equivalent to an army. The&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with their countenance and advice, and by their in|fluence
<PB REF="467">
it was determined that no Roman citi|zen &s;hould be put to death out of battle, and that no town &s;ubject to the Roman empire &s;hould be plundered by the conquerors. All the&s;e advantages both of &s;trength and council drew the wi&s;hes of mankind to his cau&s;e, and rai&s;ed an oppo&s;ition that threatened Cae&s;ar with &s;peedy de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch preparations again&s;t him, Cae&s;ar proceeded with his u&s;ual vigour, and with a courage that to ordinary capacities might &s;eem to be ra&s;hne&s;s. He now re&s;olved to face his rival in the Ea&s;t, and led his forces to Brundu|&s;ium, a &s;ea port town of Italy, in order to tran&s;|port them into Greece: but he wanted a fleet numerous enough to carry the whole at once, and it appeared dangerous to weaken his army by dividing it: be&s;ides, it was now in the mid&s;t of winter, and very difficult for any ve&s;&s;els, much more for &s;o &s;light a fleet as his was, to keep the &s;ea; added to this, all the ports and the &s;hores were filled with the numerous navy of his rival, conducted by a very vigilant com|mander. However, the&s;e con&s;iderations could not over-rule his de&s;ire to pur&s;ue the war with his u&s;ual unremitting a&s;&s;iduity; wherefore he &s;hipped off five of his twelve legions, which amounted to no more than twenty thou&s;and foot and &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e, and weighing anchor fortunately &s;teered through the mid&s;t of his ene|mies,
<PB N="457" REF="468">
timing it &s;o well that he made his pa&s;&s;age in one day. He landed at a place called Phar|&s;alus, not daring to venture into any known port, which he was apprehen&s;ive might be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy. When he &s;aw his troops &s;afely debarked, he &s;ent back the fleet to bring over the re&s;t of his forces; but thirty of his &s;hips, in their return, fell into the hands of Pompey's admiral, who &s;et them all on fire, de&s;troying mariners and all, in order to intimi|date the re&s;t by this cruel example. In the mean time he was employed in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch towns as had declared for his enemy, and in cutting off provi&s;ions from the fleet, which coa&s;ted along that part of the country. But &s;till convinced that the proper time for mak|ing propo&s;als for a peace was after gaining an advantage, he &s;ent one Rufus, whom he had taken pri&s;oner, to effect an accommodation with Pompey, offering to refer all to the &s;enate and people of Rome; but Pompey once more re|jected the overture, holding the people of Rome too much in Cae&s;ar's intere&s;ts to be relied on.</P>
<P>He was rai&s;ing &s;upplies in Macedonia when fir&s;t informed of Cae&s;ar's landing upon the coa&s;ts of Epirus: he now, therefore, re&s;olved imme|diately to march to Dyracchium, in order to cover that place from Cae&s;ar's attempts, as all his ammunition and provi&s;ions were depo&s;ited there. Upon his arrival at that city he began
<PB N="458" REF="469">
to perceive that many of his new-rai&s;ed troops were very little to be depended upon; their &s;lowne&s;s in obeying command, and their nume|rous de&s;ertions giving him very di&s;agreeable ap|prehen&s;ions. In con&s;equence of this, he obliged them to take an oath, that they would never abandon their general, but follow him through all his fortunes, and being thus &s;ecure of their attachment, he re&s;olved to harra&s;s out his rival by protracting the war, as his re&s;ources were more numerous than tho&s;e of Cae&s;ar. The fir&s;t place that both armies came in &s;ight of each other, was on the oppo&s;ite banks of the river Ap&s;us, and as both were commanded by the two greate&s;t generals then in the world, the one renowned for his conque&s;t of the Ea&s;t, the other celebrated for his victories over the We&s;t|ern parts of the empire, a battle was eagerly de&s;ired by the &s;oldiers on either &s;ide. But neither general was willing to hazard it upon this oc|ca&s;ion; Pompey could not rely upon his new levies, and Cae&s;ar would not venture an engage|ment, till he was joined by the the re&s;t of his forces. Accordingly both armies remained in this di&s;po&s;ition for &s;ome days, looking upon each other with all the anxiety of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, yet each with equal confidence of &s;ucce&s;s and mu|tual re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar had now waited &s;ome time with ex|treme impatience for the coming up of the re|mainder
<PB N="459" REF="470">
of his army, the whole of his hopes depended upon that reinforcement, and he had written and &s;ent &s;everal times to his generals to u&s;e di&s;patch. At la&s;t, de&s;pairing of their punc|tuality, and de&s;irous of being freed from the anxiety of expectation, he re&s;olved upon an at|tempt, that nothing but the extraordinary con|fidence he had in his good fortune could excu&s;e. He di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a &s;lave, and with all imaginable &s;ecrecy, went on board a fi&s;herman's bark at the mouth of the river Ap&s;us, with a de&s;ign to pa&s;s over to Brundu|&s;ium, where the re&s;t of his forces lay, and to conduct them over in per&s;on. He accordingly rowed off in the beginning of the night, and was got a con&s;iderable way to &s;ea, when the wind all of a &s;udden changed again&s;t him: the &s;ea now ro&s;e in billows of formidable height, and the &s;torm began to encrea&s;e with much violence. The fi&s;herman, who had rowed all night with great labour, was often for returning, but was di&s;&s;uaded by his pa&s;&s;enger; but at length, when far advanced on the intended voyage, he found him&s;elf unable to proceed, and yet too di&s;tant from land to hope for making good his return: in this interval of de&s;pondence he was going to give up the oar, and commit him&s;elf to the mercy of the waves, when Cae&s;ar at la&s;t di&s;covering him&s;elf, commanded him to row boldly; Fear nothing, cried he, you carry Cae&s;ar
<PB N="460" REF="471">
and his fortune. Encouraged by the pre&s;ence of &s;o great a man, the fi&s;herman made fre&s;h en|deavours, and got out to &s;ea, but the &s;torm encrea&s;ing &s;till again&s;t them, he was obliged to make for land, which was effected not without great difficulty. As &s;oon as he was on &s;hore, Cae&s;ar's &s;oldiers, who had for &s;ome time mi&s;&s;ed their general, and knew not what was become of him, came joyfully round him, congratulat|ing his e&s;cape, and kindly upbraiding his at|tempt, in &s;o far di&s;tru&s;ting their courage and affection, as to &s;eek out new forces, when they were &s;ure without any aid to conquer. His ex|cu&s;es were not le&s;s tender than their remon|&s;trances, but the joy of both was &s;oon after &s;till heightened, by an information of the landing of the troops he had long expected at Appol|lonia, from whence they were approaching un|der the conduct of Anthony and Calenus, to join him; he therefore decamped in order to meet them, and prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, Pompey with his army from engaging them on their march, as he lay on that &s;ide of the river, where the &s;uccours had been obliged to come on &s;hore. This diligence was not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful than ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for Pompey had actually made &s;ome motions to anticipate their junction, and had laid an ambu&s;cade for Anthony, which failing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e was obliged to retreat, under an apprehen|&s;ion of being hemmed in between the two ar|mies,
<PB N="461" REF="472">
&s;o that the junction was effected the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>Pompey being compelled to retreat, led his forces to A&s;paragus nigh Dyracchium, where he was &s;ure of being &s;upplied with every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his army, by the numerous fleets which he employed along the coa&s;ts of Epirus; there he pitched his camp upon a tongue of land (as mariners expre&s;s it) that jutted into the &s;ea, where al&s;o was a &s;mall &s;helter for &s;hips, where few winds could annoy them: in this place be|ing mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, he immedi|ately began to entrench his camp, which Cae&s;ar perceiving, and finding that he was not likely &s;oon to quit &s;o advantageous a po&s;t, began to entrench al&s;o behind him, cau&s;ing magazines of corn to be made in all parts not already wa&s;ted by the enemy's forces. Yet, notwith|&s;tanding all his care, provi&s;ions began to be very &s;carce in Cae&s;ar's army: his men were obliged to make u&s;e of beans and barley, and a root called Chara, which they mingled with milk; but they had been long u&s;ed to greater hard&s;hips than the&s;e, &s;o that they bore all with their accu&s;tomed patience, remembering what great honours they had often gained, after a cour&s;e of &s;uch mi&s;eries as the&s;e. The inconve|niencies that were like to follow, however, put Cae&s;ar upon a new de&s;ign. All beyond Pom|pey's camp, towards the land &s;ide, was hilly and
<PB N="462" REF="473">
&s;teep, wherefore Cae&s;ar built redoubts upon the hills, &s;tretching round from &s;hore to &s;hore, and then cau&s;ed lines of communication to be drawn from hill to hill, by which he blocked up the camp of the enemy. He hoped by this block|ade, to force the enemy to a battle, which he ar|dently de&s;ired, and which the other declined with equal indu&s;try. Not indeed, but Pompey was continually and earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by his officers and the &s;enators attending his camp, to hazard a battle; but he knew too well the danger of &s;uch an attempt, and accordingly thought only of harra&s;&s;ing out the enemy by per&s;everance. Thus both &s;ides continued for &s;ome time em|ployed in de&s;igns and &s;tratagems, the one to annoy and the other to defend. Cae&s;ar's men daily carried on their works to &s;traiten the ene|my: tho&s;e of Pompey did the &s;ame to enlarge them&s;elves, having the advantage of numbers, and though they declined coming to a battle, yet they &s;everely galled the enemy by their &s;lingers and archers. Cae&s;ar, however, was inde|fatigable, he cau&s;ed blinds or mantelets to be made of &s;kins of bea&s;ts to cover his men while at work, he cut off all the water that &s;upplied the enemy's camp, and forage from the hor&s;es, &s;o that there remained no more &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for them. In this &s;ituation, Pompey at la&s;t re&s;olved to break through his lines, and gain &s;ome other
<PB N="463" REF="474">
part of the country more convenient for en|campment. Accordingly, having informed him&s;elf of the condition of Cae&s;ar's fortifications from &s;ome de&s;erters who came over to him, he ordered his light infantry and archers on board his &s;hips, with directions to attack Cae&s;ar's en|trenchments by &s;ea, where they were lea&s;t de|fended. This was done with &s;uch effect, that all the centurions of Cae&s;ar's fir&s;t cohort were cut off except one, and though Cae&s;ar and his officers u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to hin|der Pompey's de&s;igns, yet by means of reitera|ted attempts, he at la&s;t effected his purpo&s;e of extricating his army from his former camp, and of encamping in another place by the &s;ea, where he had the conveniency of forage and &s;hipping al&s;o. Cae&s;ar being thus fru&s;trated in his views of blocking up the enemy, and per|ceiving the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained, re&s;olved at la&s;t to force Pompey to a battle, though upon di&s;advantageous terms. The engagement began by attempting to cut off a legion of the enemy which was po&s;ted in a wood, and this brought on a general battle. The conflict was for &s;ome time carried on with great ardour, and with equal fortune, but Cae&s;ar's army being intan|gled in the entrenchments of the old camps lately abandoned, began to fall into di&s;order, upon which, Pompey pre&s;&s;ing his advantage, they at la&s;t fled with great precipitation. Great
<PB N="464" REF="475">
numbers peri&s;hed in the trenches and on the banks of the river, pre&s;&s;ed to death by their fellows. Pompey pur&s;ued his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to the very camp of Cae&s;ar, and now was the cri&s;is of Cae&s;ar's fate, it only depended upon the re|&s;olution and per&s;everance of Pompey's men to attack his entrenchments, and utterly de&s;troy his whole army; but his u&s;ual good fortune prevailed; Pompey, either &s;urprized with the &s;uddenne&s;s of his victory, or fearful of an am|bu&s;cade, withdrew his troops into his own camp, and thus lo&s;t the empire of the world. However, his generals and attendants looked upon his pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s as a deci&s;ive determi|nation of the war. Not thinking of future en|gagements and dangers, they carried them&s;elves as undoubted conquerors, and adding cruelty to their confidence, put all their pri&s;oners to the &s;word. Cae&s;ar, however, was not to be in|timidated by a &s;ingle blow, he found that hi|therto his attempts to force Pompey to engage him upon equal terms, were ineffectual, he therefore re&s;olved to appear as if willing to change the whole cour&s;e of the war, and to pro|tract it in his turn: wherefore, calling the army together, he addre&s;&s;ed them with his u&s;ual calmne&s;s and intrepidity, in the following man|ner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have no rea&s;on, my fellow &s;oldiers, to be dejected at our late mi&s;carriage; the lo&s;s of one battle, after &s;uch numbers that
<PB N="465" REF="476">
have been gained, &s;hould rather awaken out caution than depre&s;s our re&s;olution: let us remember the long cour&s;e of victories which have been gained by us in Gaul, Britain, Italy and Spain, and then let us con&s;ider how many greater dangers we have e&s;caped, which have only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the plea&s;ure of &s;ucceeding victory. If after all the&s;e renown|ed exploits and glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es, one little di&s;order, one error of inadvertancy, or indeed of de&s;tiny it&s;elf, has deprived us of our ju&s;t reward, yet we have &s;till &s;ufficient force to en&s;ure it for the future; and though we &s;hould be deprived of every re&s;ource, yet the brave have one &s;till left to overcome every danger, namely, to de&s;pi&s;e it."</Q> After thus encouraging his men, and degrading &s;ome of his &s;ubaltern officers who were remi&s;s in their duty, he prepared to lead his forces from their camp, and to make his retreat to Appollonia, where he intended to refre&s;h and recruit his army. Having therefore cau&s;ed his baggage to go on before, he marched after at the head of his &s;oldiers, and though pur&s;ued by Pompey, yet having the advantage of &s;etting off eight hours before him, he effected his intent.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Domitius, one of his lieu|tenants, was in Macedonia with three legions, and in danger of being &s;urprized by the &s;uperior forces of the enemy; he re&s;olved therefore to
<PB N="466" REF="477">
join him with all expedition, and after having refre&s;hed his army, &s;et forward with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. Pompey was in pretty much the &s;ame circum&s;tances of apprehen&s;ion, for Scipio, one of his lieutenants, who was in The&s;&s;aly, at the head of the Syrian legion; and he was fearful, le&s;t Cae&s;ar's march was intended to cut off this body of troops before their junction. Thus each ge|neral marched with all the diligence po&s;&s;ible, both to &s;ecure their friends, and &s;urprize their enemies. Cae&s;ar's di&s;patch was mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; he was joined by Domitius upon the frontiers of The&s;&s;aly, and thus, with all his forces united into one body, he marched directly to Gomphi, a town that lies farther within that province. But the news of his defeat at Dyracchium had reached this place before him; the inhabitants therefore, who had before promi&s;ed him obe|dience&punc; now changed their minds, and with a degree of ba&s;ene&s;s, equal to their imprudence, &s;hut their gates again&s;t him. Cae&s;ar was not to be injured with impunity, wherefore, having re|pre&s;ented to his &s;oldiers the great advantage of forcing a place &s;o very rich, he ordered the ma|chines for &s;caling to be got ready, and cau&s;ing an a&s;&s;ault to be made, proceeded with &s;uch vi|gour, that notwith&s;tanding the great height of the walls, the town was taken in a few hours time. Cae&s;ar left it to be plundered, and with|out delaying his march, went forward to Me|tropolis,
<PB N="467" REF="478">
another town of the &s;ame province, which yielded at his approach; by this means, he &s;oon became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all The&s;&s;aly, except Lari&s;&s;a, which was garri&s;oned by Scipio with his legion, who commanded for Pompey.</P>
<P>During this interval, Pompey's officers, being grown in&s;upportably vain upon their late victory, were continually &s;oliciting their commander to come to a battle: every delay became in&s;up|portable to them; they pre&s;umed to a&s;&s;ert, that he was willing to make the mo&s;t of his com|mand, and to keep the numerous body of &s;e|nators and nobles that followed his fortunes, &s;till in &s;ubjection: confident of victory, they di|vided all the places in the government among each other, and portioned out the lands of tho&s;e, whom in imagination they had already vanqui&s;hed, among&s;t each other. Nor did re|venge le&s;s employ their thoughts, than ambi|tion or avarice: this was not confined to &s;uch only as had taken up arms again&s;t them, but to all tho&s;e who continued neuter, and had yet &s;ided with neither party. The pro&s;cription was actu|ally drawn up, not for the condemnation of in|dividuals, but of whole ranks of the enemy: it was even propo&s;ed, that all the &s;enators in Pompey's army &s;hould be appointed judges over &s;uch as had either actually oppo&s;ed, or by their neutrality, had failed to a&s;&s;i&s;t their party. Pompey being thus &s;urrounded by men of weak
<PB N="468" REF="479">
heads and eager expectations, and ince&s;&s;antly teized with importunities to engage, found him|&s;elf too weak to oppo&s;e: he re&s;olved therefore at la&s;t, to renounce his own judgment, in com|pliance with tho&s;e about him, and to give up all &s;chemes of prudence for tho&s;e dictated by avarice and pa&s;&s;ion. Wherefore, advancing into The&s;&s;aly, within a few days after the taking of Gomphi, he drew down upon the plains of Phar&s;alia, where he was joined by Scipio his lieutenant, with the troops under his command. Here he awaited the coming up of Cae&s;ar, re&s;olved upon engaging, and upon deciding the fate of kingdoms at a &s;ingle battle.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar had employed all his art for &s;ome time in &s;ounding the inclinations of his men, and providing for their &s;afety in ca&s;e of mi&s;carriage, but at length, finding them re&s;olute and vigo|rous, he cau&s;ed them to advance towards the plains of Phar&s;alia, where Pompey was now en|camped. The approach of the&s;e two great ar|mies, compo&s;ed of the be&s;t and brave&s;t troops in the world, together with the greatne&s;s of the prize for which they contended, filled all minds with anxiety, though with different expectations. Pompey's army, being mo&s;t numerous, turned all their thoughts to the enjoyment of the vic|tory; Cae&s;ar's, with better aims, con&s;idered only the means of obtaining it: Pompey's army de|pended upon their numbers, and their many
<PB N="469" REF="480">
generals; Cae&s;ar's, upon their own di&s;cipline, and the conduct of their &s;ingle commander: Pompey's partizans hoped much from the ju&s;|tice of their cau&s;e; Cae&s;ar's alledged the fre|quent propo&s;als which they had made for peace without effect: thus the views, hopes and mo|tives of both &s;eemed different, but their hatred and ambition were the &s;ame. Cae&s;ar, who was ever foremo&s;t in offering battle, led out his ar|my in array to meet the enemy; but Pompey, either &s;u&s;pecting his troops, or dreading the event, kept his advantageous &s;ituation for &s;ome time: he drew indeed &s;ometimes out of his camp, but always kept him&s;elf under his tren|ches, at the foot of the hill near which he was po&s;ted. Cae&s;ar being unwilling to attack him at a di&s;advantage, re&s;olved to decamp the next day, hoping to harra&s;s out his antagoni&s;t, who was not a match for him in &s;u&s;taining the fatigues of duty; and in expectation, that as the enemy would not fail following him, he might find &s;ome happier opportunity of coming to an engagement. Accordingly, the order for marching was given, and the tents &s;truck, when word was brought him, that Pompey's army had quitted their entrenchments, and had advanced further into the plain than u&s;ual, &s;o that he might engage them at le&s;s di&s;advantage. This was the juncture that Cae&s;ar had &s;o long wi&s;hed for in vain; ever &s;ince he had landed in Greece,
<PB N="470" REF="481">
he had been employed in endeavours to draw on a general engagement and feared nothing &s;o much as to protract the war: whereupon he now cau&s;ed his troops that were upon their march to halt, and with a countenance of joy informed them that the happy time was at la&s;t come, which they had &s;o long wi&s;hed for, and which was to crown their glory and terminate their fatigues. After which he drew up his troops in order, and advanced towards the place of battle. His forces did not amount to above half tho&s;e of Pompey; the army of the one amounting to above forty-five thou&s;and foot, and &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e; that of the other not exceeding twenty-two thou|&s;and foot, and about a thou&s;and hor&s;e. This di&s;proportion, particularly in the cavalry, had filled Cae&s;ar with apprehen&s;ions; wherefore he had &s;ome days before picked out the &s;tronge&s;t and nimble&s;t of his foot-&s;oldiers, and accu&s;|tomed them to fight between the ranks of his cavalry. By their a&s;&s;i&s;tance his thou&s;and hor&s;e was a match for Pompey's &s;even thou&s;and, and had actually got the better in a &s;kirmi&s;h that happened between them, &s;ome days before.</P>
<P>Pompey, on the other hand, had &s;trong ex|pectations of &s;ucce&s;s; he boa&s;ted in council, that he could put Cae&s;ar's legions to flight, without &s;triking a &s;ingle blow, pre&s;uming, that as &s;oon as the armies formed, his ca|valry,
<PB N="471" REF="482">
on which he placed his greate&s;t ex|pectations, would out-flank and &s;urround the enemy. Labienus commended this &s;cheme of Pompey, alledging al&s;o that the pre&s;ent troops of which Cae&s;ar's army was compo&s;ed were but the &s;hadow of tho&s;e old legions that had fought in Britain and Gaul; that all the veterans were worn out, and had been replaced by new levies made in a hurry in Ci&s;alpine Gaul. To en|crea&s;e the confidence of the army &s;till more, he took an oath, which the re&s;t followed him in, never to return to the camp but with victory. In this di&s;po&s;ition, and under the&s;e advantage|ous circum&s;tances, Pompey led his troops to battle.</P>
<P>Pompey's order of battle was good and well judged. In the centre and on the two flanks he placed all his veterans, and di&s;tributed his new|rai&s;ed troops between the wings and the main body. The Syrian legions were placed in the centre under the command of Scipio; the Spa|niards, on whom he greatly relied, were put on the right under Domitius Aenobarbus; and on the left were &s;tationed the two legions which Cae&s;ar had re&s;tored in the beginning of the war, led on by Pompey him&s;elf; becau&s;e from thence he intended to make the attack which was to gain the day; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on he had there a&s;&s;embled all his hor&s;e, &s;lingers and arch|ers, of which his right wing had no need, be|ing
<PB N="472" REF="483">
covered by the river Enipeus. Cae&s;ar like|wi&s;e divided his army into three bodies under three commanders; Domitius Calvinus being placed in the centre and Mark Anthony on the left, while he him&s;elf led on the right wing, which was to oppo&s;e the left commanded by Pompey. It is remarkable enough that Pom|pey cho&s;e to put him&s;elf at the head of tho&s;e troops which were di&s;ciplined and in&s;tructed by Cae&s;ar: an inconte&s;tible proof how much he va|lued them above any of the re&s;t of his army. Cae&s;ar, on the contrary, placed him&s;elf at the head of his tenth legion that had owed all its merit and fame to his own training. As he ob|&s;erved the enemy's numerous cavalry to be all drawn to one &s;pot, he gue&s;s'd at Pompey's in|tention; to obviate which he made a draught of &s;ix cohorts from his rear line, and forming them into a &s;eparate body, concealed them behind his right wing, with in&s;tructions not to throw their javelins on the approach of Pompey's hor&s;e, as was cu&s;tomary, but to keep them in their hands and pu&s;h them directly in the faces and the eyes of the hor&s;emen, who being compo&s;ed of the younger part of the Roman nobility, va|lued them&s;elves much upon their beauty, and dreaded a &s;car in the face more than a wound in the body. He la&s;tly placed the little cavalry he had &s;o as to cover the right of the tenth legion, ordering his third line not to march 'till they
<PB N="473" REF="484">
had received the &s;ignal from him. And now the fate of the va&s;t empire of Rome was to be decided by the greate&s;t generals, the brave&s;t of|ficers, and the mo&s;t expert troops that mankind had ever &s;een 'till that hour. Each private man in both armies was almo&s;t capable of perform|ing the duty of a commander, and &s;eemed in|&s;pired with a de&s;ire to conquer or die. As the armies approached, the two generals went from rank to rank encouraging their men, warning their hopes and le&s;&s;ening their apprehen&s;ions. Pompey repre&s;ented to his men that the glori|ous occa&s;ion which they had long be&s;ought him to grant was now before them; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And indeed, cried he, what advantages could you wi&s;h over an enemy that you are not now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of? Your numbers, your vigour, a late vic|tory, all a&s;&s;ure a &s;peedy and an ea&s;y conque&s;t of tho&s;e harra&s;&s;ed and broken troops, com|po&s;ed of men worn out with age and impre&s;t with the terrors of a recent defeat: but there is &s;till a &s;tronger bulwark for our protection than the &s;uperiority of our &s;trength, the ju&s;|tice of our cau&s;e. You are engaged in the defence of liberty and of your country; you are &s;upported by its laws, and followed by its magi&s;trates; you have the world &s;pectators of your conduct, and wi&s;hing you &s;ucce&s;s: on the contrary, he whom you oppo&s;e is a robber and oppre&s;&s;or of his country, and al|mo&s;t

mo&s;t already &s;unk with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his crimes, as well as the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his arms. Shew then on this occa&s;ion all that ardour and dete&s;tation of tyranny that &s;hould animate Romans, and do ju&s;tice to mankind."</Q> Cae&s;ar, on his &s;ide, went among his men with that &s;teady &s;erenity for which he was &s;o much admired in the mid&s;t of danger. He in&s;i&s;ted on nothing &s;o &s;trongly to his &s;oldiers as his frequent and un&s;ucce&s;sful endeavours for peace. He talked with terror of the blood he was going to &s;hed, and pleaded only the nece&s;&s;ity that urged him to it. He deplored the many brave men that were to fall on both &s;ides, and the wounds of his country whoever &s;hould be victorious. His &s;oldiers an&s;wered his &s;peech with looks of ar|dour and impatience, which ob&s;erving he gave the &s;ignal to begin. The word on Pompey's &s;ide was, Hercules the invincible: that on Cae|&s;ar's, Venus the victorious. There was only &s;o much &s;pace between both armies as to give room for fighting; wherefore Pompey ordered his men to receive the fir&s;t &s;hock without mov|ing out of their places, expecting the enemies ranks to be put into di&s;order by their motion. Cae&s;ar's &s;oldiers were now ru&s;hing on with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, when perceiving the enemy motionle&s;s, they all &s;topt &s;hort, as if by gene|ral con&s;ent, and halted in the mid&s;t of their
<PB N="475" REF="486">
career. A terrible pau&s;e en&s;ued, in which both armies continued to gaze upon each other with mutual terror and dreadful &s;erenity: at length, Cae&s;ar's men having taken breath, ran furi|ou&s;ly upon the enemy, fir&s;t di&s;charging their javelins and then drawing their &s;words. The &s;ame method was ob&s;erved by Pompey's troops, who as vigorou&s;ly &s;u&s;tained the attack. His cavalry al&s;o were ordered to charge at the very on&s;et, which, with the multitude of archers and &s;lingers, &s;oon obliged Cae&s;ar's men to give ground, and get them&s;elves, as he had fore&s;een, upon the flank of his army: whereupon Cae&s;ar immediately ordered the &s;ix cohorts that were placed as a reinforcement to advance, and re|peated his orders to &s;trike at the enemies faces. This had it's de&s;ired effect; the cavalry, that were but ju&s;t now &s;ure of victory, received an immediate check: the unu&s;ual method of fight|ing pur&s;ued by the cohorts, their aiming en|tirely at the vi&s;ages of the a&s;&s;ailants, and the horrible disfiguring wounds they made, all con|tributed to intimidate them &s;o much, that, in|&s;tead of defending their per&s;ons, their only en|deavour was to &s;ave their faces. A total route en&s;ued of their whole body, which fled in great di&s;order to the neighbouring mountains, while the archers and &s;lingers, who were thus aban|doned, were cut to pieces. Cae&s;ar now com|manded the cohorts to pur&s;ue their &s;ucce&s;s, and
<PB N="476" REF="487">
advancing, charged Pompey's troops upon the flank: this charge the enemy with&s;tood for &s;ome time with great bravery 'till he brought up his third line, which had not yet engaged. Pompey's infantry being thus doubly attacked, in front by fre&s;h troops and in rear by the victorious cohorts, could no longer re&s;i&s;t, but fled to their camp. The flight began among the &s;trangers, though Pompey's right wing &s;till valiantly maintained their ground. Cae&s;ar, however, being convinced that the victory was certain, with his u&s;ual clemency, cried out to pur&s;ue the &s;trangers, but to &s;pare the Romans; upon which they all laid down their arms and re|ceived quarter. The greate&s;t &s;laughter was among the auxiliaries, who fled on all quarters, but principally went for &s;afety to the camp. The battle had now la&s;ted from the break of day 'till noon, the weather being extremely hot; notwith&s;tanding, the conquerors did not remit their ardour, being encouraged by the ex|ample of their general, who thought his victory not complete till he was ma&s;ter of the enemy's camp. Accordingly, marching on foot at their head, he called upon them to follow and &s;trike the deci&s;ive blow. The cohorts, which were left to defend the camp, for &s;ome time made a formidable re&s;i&s;tance; particularly a great number of Thracians and other barbarians, who were appointed for it's defence; but
<PB N="477" REF="488">
nothing could re&s;i&s;t the ardour of Cae&s;ar's victo|rious army, they were at la&s;t driven from their trenches, and all fled to the mountains not far off.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar &s;eeing the field and camp &s;trewed with his fallen countrymen, was &s;trongly affected at &s;o melancholy a pro&s;pect, and could not help crying out to one that &s;tood near him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They would have it &s;o."</Q> Upon entering the ene|mies camp, every object pre&s;ented fre&s;h in&s;tan|ces of the blind pre&s;umption and madne&s;s of his adver&s;aries: on all &s;ides were to be &s;een tents adorned with ivy and branches of myrtle, couches covered with purple, and &s;ide-boards loaded with plate. Every thing gave proofs of the highe&s;t luxury, and &s;eemed rather the pre|parative for a banquet, the rejoicings for a vic|tory, than the di&s;po&s;itions for a battle. A camp &s;o richly furni&s;hed, might have been able to en|gage the attention of any troops but Cae&s;ar's, there was &s;till &s;omething to be done, and he would not permit them to pur&s;ue any other ob|ject than their enemies, till they were entirely &s;ubdued. A con&s;iderable body of the&s;e having retired to the adjacent mountains, he prevailed on his &s;oldiers to join him in the pur&s;uit, in order to oblige the&s;e to &s;urrender: he began by inclo&s;ing them with a line drawn at the foot of the mountain, but they quickly abandoned a po&s;t which was not tenable for want of water,
<PB N="478" REF="489">
and endeavoured to reach the city of Lari&s;&s;a. Cae&s;ar led a part of his army by a &s;horter way, and intercepted their retreat, drawing up in or|der of battle between them and the city. How|ever, the&s;e unhappy fugitives once more found protection from a mountain, at the foot of which a rivulet ran which &s;upplied them with water. Now night approaching, Cae&s;ar's men were almo&s;t &s;pent, and ready to faint with their ince&s;&s;ant toil &s;ince morning, yet &s;till he prevail|ed upon them once more to renew their la|bours, and to cut off the rivulet that &s;upplied them. The fugitives, thus deprived of all hopes of &s;uccour or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;ent deputies to the conqueror, offering to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion: during this interval of negotia|tion, a few &s;enators that were among them, took the advantage of the night to e&s;cape, and the re&s;t next morning gave up their arms, and experienced the conqueror's clemency. In fact, he addre&s;&s;ed them with great gentlene&s;s, and forbade his &s;oldiers to offer them any violence, or to take any thing from them. Thus Cae&s;ar by his conduct gained the mo&s;t complete victo|ry that had ever been obtained, and by his great clemency after the battle, &s;eemed to have de|&s;erved it. His lo&s;s amounted to but two hun|dred men, that of Pompey to fifteen thou&s;and, as well Romans as auxiliaries: twenty-four thou&s;and men &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners
<PB N="479" REF="490">
war, and the greate&s;t part of the&s;e entered into Cae&s;ar's army, and were incorporated with the re&s;t of his forces. As to the &s;enators and Ro|man knights who fell into his hands, he gene|rou&s;ly gave them liberty to retire wherever they thought proper: and as for the letters which Pompey had received from &s;everal per&s;ons who wi&s;hed to be thought neutral, he burnt them all without reading them, as Pompey had done upon a former occa&s;ion. Thus having perform|ed all the duties of a general and a &s;tate&s;man, he &s;ent for the legions which had pa&s;&s;ed the night in the camp, to relieve tho&s;e which had accompanied him in the pur&s;uit, and being de|termined to follow Pompey, began his march, and arrived the &s;ame day at Lari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>As for Pompey, who had formerly &s;hewn &s;uch in&s;tances of courage and conduct, when he &s;aw his cavalry routed, on which he had placed his &s;ole dependance, he ab&s;olutely lo&s;t his rea&s;on. In&s;tead of thinking how to remedy this di&s;order by rallying &s;uch troops as fled, or by oppo&s;ing fre&s;h troops to &s;top the progre&s;s of the conquerors, being totally amazed by this fir&s;t blow, he returned to the camp, and in his tent, waited the i&s;&s;ue of an event, which it was his duty to direct, not to follow: there he remain|ed for &s;ome moments without &s;peaking, till be|ing told, that the camp was attacked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, &s;ays he, are we pur&s;ued to our very entrench|ments?"</Q>
<PB N="480" REF="491">
and immediately quitting his ar|mour for a habit more &s;uited to his circum|&s;tances, he fled away on hor&s;eback to Lari&s;&s;a, from whence, perceiving he was not pur&s;ued, he &s;lackened his pace, giving way to all the agonizing reflections which his deplorable &s;itua|tion mu&s;t naturally &s;ugge&s;t. In this melancholy manner he pa&s;&s;ed along the vale of Tempe, and pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of the river Peneus, at la&s;t arrived at a fi&s;herman's hut, in which he pa&s;&s;ed the night. From thence he went on board a little bark, and keeping along the &s;ea-&s;hore, he de&s;cryed a &s;hip of &s;ome burthen, which &s;eemed preparing to &s;ail, in which he embarked, the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el &s;till paying him the homage which was due to his former &s;tation. From the mouth of the river Peneus, he &s;ailed to Amphipolis, where finding his affairs de&s;perate, he &s;teered to Le&s;bos, to take in his wife Cor|nelia, whom he had left there, at a di&s;tance from the dangers and hurry of the war. She who had long flattered her&s;elf with the hopes of victory, felt the rever&s;e of her fortune in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s: &s;he was de&s;ired by the me&s;|&s;enger, who&s;e tears, more than words, proclaim|ed the greatne&s;s of her misfortunes, to di&s;patch if &s;he expected to &s;ee Pompey, with but one &s;hip, and even that not his own: her grief, which before was violent, became then in&s;upportable; &s;he fain|ted away, and lay a con&s;iderable time without
<PB N="481" REF="492">
any &s;igns of life. At length, recovering her|&s;elf, and reflecting it was now no time for vain lamentations, &s;he ran quite through the city, to the &s;ea-&s;ide. Pompey received her in his arms, without &s;peaking a word, and for &s;ome time, &s;upported her in his arms in &s;ilent de&s;pair. After a pau&s;e of long continuance, they found words for their di&s;tre&s;s; Cornelia imputed to her&s;elf a part of the mi&s;eries that were come upon them, and in&s;tanced many former misfor|tunes of her life. Pompey endeavoured to comfort her, by in&s;tancing the uncertainty of human affairs, and from his pre&s;ent unexpected wretchedne&s;s, teaching her to hope for as unex|pected turns of good fortune. In the mean time, the people of the i&s;land, who had great obligations to Pompey, gathered round them, joining in their grief, and inviting them into their city. Pompey however declined their in|vitation, and even advi&s;ed them to &s;ubmit to the conqueror. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be under no apprehen|hen&s;ions, cried he, Cae&s;ar may be my enemy, but &s;till let me acknowledge his moderation and humanity."</Q> Cratippus, the Greek phi|lo&s;opher, al&s;o came to pay his re&s;pects. Pom|pey, as is but too frequent with per&s;ons under misfortunes, complained to him of providence. Cratippus, who was a man of genius and un|der&s;tood the world, declined entering deeply into the argument, rather &s;atisfied with &s;upply|ing
<PB N="482" REF="493">
new motives to hope, than combating the pre&s;ent impiety of his de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Having taken in Cornelia, he now continued his cour&s;e, &s;teering to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;top|ping no longer than was nece&s;&s;ary to take in provi&s;ions at the ports that occurred in his pa&s;|&s;age. He came before Rhodes, but the people of this city were changed with his fortunes, again&s;t him. From thence he went to Attilia, where he was joined by &s;ome &s;oldiers and &s;hips of war. However, the&s;e were nothing again&s;t the power of his rival, from the activity of who&s;e pur&s;uit he was in continual apprehen&s;ions. His forces were too much ruined and di&s;per&s;ed to be ever collected once more; his only hopes therefore lay in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the kings who were in his alliance, and from the&s;e only he could expect &s;ecurity and protection. He was him&s;elf inclined to retire to the Parthians, others propo&s;ed Juba, king of Numidia, but he was at la&s;t prevailed upon to apply to Pto|lemy, king of Egypt, to who&s;e father Pompey had been a con&s;iderable benefactor. Accord|ingly, he le&s;t Cilicia where he then was, and &s;teering for the kingdom of Egypt, came in view of the coa&s;ts of that country, and &s;ent to the young king, to implore protection and &s;afe|ty. Ptolemy, who was as yet a minor, had not the government in his own hands, but he and his kingdom were under the protection of
<PB N="483" REF="494">
Photinus, an eunuch, and Theodotus, a ma&s;ter of the art of &s;peaking. Before the&s;e therefore, Pompey's reque&s;t was argued: before &s;uch mean and mercenary per&s;ons was to be deter|mined the fate of one, who, but a few days before, had given law to kingdoms. The opi|nions of the council were divided, gratitude and pity inclined &s;ome to receive him, whil&s;t others, more obdurate or more timorous, were for de|nying him entrance into the kingdom. At length, Theodotus the rhetorician, as if willing to di&s;play his eloquence, maintained, that both propo&s;als were equally dangerous: that to ad|mit him, was making Pompey their ma&s;ter, and drawing on them Cae&s;ar's re&s;entment; and by not receiving him, they offended the one' without obliging the other: that therefore, the only expedient left, was to give him leave to land, and then to kill him: this would at once oblige Cae&s;ar, and rid them of all apprehen|&s;ions from Pompey's re&s;entment: for, con|cluded he, with a vulgar and malicious joke, dead dogs can never bite. This advice pre|vailing in a council compo&s;ed of the &s;laves of an effeminate and luxurious court, Achillas, commander of the forces, and Septimius, by birth a Roman, and who had formerly been a centurion in Pompey's army, were appointed to carry it into execution. Accordingly, attended by three or four more, they went into a little
<PB N="484" REF="495">
bark, and rowed off from land towards Pom|pey's &s;hip, that lay off about a mile from the &s;hore. When Pompey and his friends &s;aw the boat moving off from &s;hore, they began to wonder at the meanne&s;s of the preparations to receive him, and &s;ome even ventured to &s;u&s;pect the intentions of the Egyptian court. But be|fore any thing could be determined, Achillas was come up to the &s;hip's &s;ide, and in the Greek language welcomed him to Egypt, and invited him into the boat, alledging, that the &s;hallows prevented larger ve&s;&s;els from coming off to receive him. Pompey, after having ta|ken leave of Cornelia, who wept at his depar|ture, and having repeated two ver&s;es of Sopho|cles, &s;ignifying, that he who tru&s;ts his freedom to a tyrant, from that moment becomes a &s;lave, gave his hand to Achillas, and &s;tept into the bark, with only two attendants of his own. They had now rowed from the &s;hip a good way, and as during that time they all kept a profound &s;ilence, Pompey, willing to begin the di&s;cour&s;e, acco&s;ted Septimius, who&s;e face he recollected. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Methinks, friend, cried he, that you and I were once fellow &s;oldiers together."</Q> Septimius gave only a nod with his head, with|out uttering a word, or in&s;tancing the lea&s;t ci|vility. Pompey therefore took out a paper, on which he had minuted a &s;peech he intended to make the king, and began reading it. In this
<PB N="485" REF="496">
manner they approached the &s;hore, and Corne|lia, who&s;e concern had never &s;uffered her to lo&s;e &s;ight of her hu&s;band, began to conceive hopes, when &s;he perceived the people on the &s;trand crowding down along the coa&s;ts, as if willing to receive him: but her hopes were &s;oon de|&s;troyed, for that in&s;tant, as Pompey ro&s;e, &s;up|porting him&s;elf upon his freedman's arm, Sep|timius &s;tabbed him in the back, and was in&s;tantly &s;econded by Achillas. Pompey per|ceiving his death inevitable, only di&s;po&s;ed him|&s;elf to meet it with decency, and covering his face with his robe, without &s;peaking a word, with a &s;igh, re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate. At this horrid &s;ight, Cornelia &s;hrieked &s;o loud as to be heard to the &s;hore, but the danger &s;he her&s;elf was in did not allow the mariners time to look on, they immediately &s;et &s;ail, and the wind proving favourable, fortunately they e&s;caped the pur&s;uit of the Egyptian gallies. In the mean time, Pompey's murderers having cut off his head, cau&s;ed it to be embalmed, the better to pre&s;erve its features, de&s;igning it for a pre&s;ent to Cae&s;ar. The body was thrown naked on the &s;trand, and expo&s;ed to the view of all who&s;e curio&s;ity led them that way. How|ever, his faithful freedman Philip &s;till kept near it, and when the crowd was di&s;per&s;ed, he wa&s;h|ed it in the &s;ea, and looking round for materials to burn it, he perceived the wrecks of a fi&s;hing
<PB N="486" REF="497">
boat, of which he compo&s;ed a pile. While he was thus piou&s;ly employed, he was acco&s;ted by an old Roman &s;oldier, who had &s;erved under Pompey in his youth. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who art thou, &s;aid he, that art making the&s;e humble prepara|tions for Pompey's funeral?"</Q> Philip having an&s;wered, that he was one of his freedmen, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas, replied the &s;oldier, permit me to &s;hare in this honour al&s;o: among all the mi&s;eries of my exile, it will be my la&s;t &s;ad comfort, that I have been able to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the funeral of my old commander, and touch the body of the brave&s;t general that ever Rome pro|duced."</Q> After this, they both joined in giv|ing the cor&s;e the la&s;t rites, and collecting his a&s;hes, buried them under a little ri&s;ing earth, &s;craped together with their hands, over which was afterwards placed the following in&s;cription: <HI>He who&s;e merits de&s;erved a temple, can now &s;carce find a tomb.</HI> Such was the end, and &s;uch the funeral of Pompey the Great, a man who had many opportunities of en&s;laving his country, but yet rejected them all. He was fonder of glory than of power, of prai&s;e rather than command, and was more vain than ambitious. His talents in war were every way &s;uperior to all the re&s;t of his cotemporaries, except Cae&s;ar; it was therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> peculiar misfortune to contend with a man, in who&s;e pre&s;ence, all other military merit lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> lu&s;tre.

la&s;t war were more ju&s;t than Cae&s;ar's, mu&s;t for ever remain doubtful; certain it is, that he fre|quently rejected all offers of accommodation, and began to talk of puni&s;hment, before he had any preten&s;ions to power. But whatever might have been his intentions, in ca&s;e of victory, they could not have been executed with more moderation than tho&s;e of Cae&s;ar. The corrup|tions of the &s;tate were too great to admit of any other cure but that of an ab&s;olute government, and it was not po&s;&s;ible that power could have fallen into better hands than tho&s;e of the con|queror. From Pompey's death therefore, we may date the total extinction of the republic. From this period the &s;enate was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all its power, and Rome, from henceforward, was never without a ma&s;ter.</P>
