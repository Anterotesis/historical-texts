<P>SPEECH OF PHILIP FRANCIS, E&s;q.

<HEAD>SPEECH OF PHILIP FRANCIS, E&s;q. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HOUSE OF COMMONS,
<DATE>Friday, 26th February, <HI>1796.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. FRANCIS &s;aid that, altho' he was but little prepared and not at all inclined to enter far into the debate, and tho' he was full of impatience and curio&s;ity to know what the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to &s;ay <HI>for him&s;elf,</HI> or whether he would be content to re&s;t his defence on the ground taken, and tru&s;t it to the argu|ments u&s;ed by the learned gentleman, neverthele&s;s there were &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in that gentleman's &s;peech, of which he thought him&s;elf bound not only as a Member of Parliament, but e&s;pecially as a di|ligent if not very active Member of the Committee, to take &s;ome notice. On tho&s;e particulars I &s;hall fir&s;t endeavour to &s;et the Hou&s;e right, and to prevent their being mi&s;led. Not that the facts, mi&s;tated by the learned gentleman, are very material in them|&s;elves, but becau&s;e &s;ome &s;erious conclu&s;ions have been fallaciou&s;ly drawn from them. I &s;hall then endeavour to &s;hew that the learned gentleman, in the general drift and tendency of his &s;peech, has laboured to divert the attention of the Hou&s;e from the real object of the inquiry, and to fix it on others, not immedi|ately in que&s;tion, or not e&s;&s;ential to the point in i&s;&s;ue, namely, whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer has or has not made a provident bargain for the Public; and, if he has not, to what motives his mi&s;conduct may fairly and rationally be imputed. The fir&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly be proved; the &s;econd can only be matter of moral inference or unavoidable conclu&s;ion, and never the &s;ub|ject, or very rarely, of direct evidence. No man accu&s;ed has
<PB N="4" REF="3">
a right, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to plead character again&s;t conduct, or expect us to conclude that he has acted faithfully, becau&s;e the wor&s;t motives po&s;&s;ible are not to be proved by witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him. Almo&s;t the whole of the learned gentleman's &s;peech has been a digre&s;&s;ion from the que&s;tion. He has ince&s;&s;antly travelled out of the record; but I flatter my&s;elf that, before I &s;it down, I &s;hall be able to bring him back to it.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman has thought fit to open his defence of this tran&s;action by a triumphant appeal to the opinion of the Commit|tee, declared in the out&s;et and &s;tated in the front of their report, viz.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, on the in&s;pection of the li&s;ts, as well as from the ex|amination of the parties, your Committee &s;ee no ground to &s;up|po&s;e, that any interference took place, on the part of any per|&s;ons connected with Government, in the di&s;tribution of any partof the loan."</Q>
And this declaration, he &s;ays, was made with the unanimous concurrence of the Committee, and expre&s;sly of the Chairman and his colleagues; a de&s;cription of a part of the Com|mittee not very parliamentary in point of form, and perfectly unju&s;t in its application. The word <HI>colleague,</HI> applied in that manner, would have no meaning, if it were not intended to intimate that the Committee was banded into parties, one of which was determined to cen&s;ure and to condemn; and that the opinion, if agreed to by two or three of <HI>us,</HI> who might be &s;uppo&s;ed to attend on the part of oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t be unque&s;tionably true in it&s;elf, and in all its con|&s;equences. Now, Sir, I can affirm for one, and I believe it will not be denied by any, that, altho' I attended the Committee con&s;tantly 'till the la&s;t two or three days, when I conceived the bu|&s;ine&s;s was in effect over, and that nothing remained to clo&s;e the proceedings but a repetition of the &s;ame formal que&s;tion to the &s;everal &s;ub&s;cribers, I took but little part, certainly not an eager part, in the inquiry. I a&s;ked &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es a very few que&s;tions, and left it to the honourable gentlemen on the other &s;ide, who&s;e &s;uperior numbers, generally ten to one, gave them an ab&s;o|lute command of the inquiry, to conduct it as they plea&s;ed. I was not pre&s;ent, when the preamble to the Report was voted. I had neither notice nor &s;u&s;picion, that it was intended to introduce &s;uch a declaration into a Report of Evidence. Otherwi&s;e, a&s;&s;uredly I &s;hould have attended on purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e it. In this &s;en&s;e then, and with this explanation, the re&s;olution of the Committee was not unanimous. In any other, the unanimity, in which the learned gentleman triumphs, proves nothing. It was properly and exclu|&s;ively the act of him&s;elf and his friends. I now object to it as not only untrue in the available meaning and effect of unanimity, which
<PB N="5" REF="4">
amounts to nothing unle&s;s it includes the opinion of your opponent, but as utterly irregular, and in every point of view inconclu&s;ive. In the fir&s;t place, I affirm that the declaration, whether true or not, ought not to have been forced into the Report. The Com|mittee was appointed to
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"inquire into the circum&s;tances of the negociation of the late loan, and <HI>were impowered</HI> only to report the evidence, as it &s;hould appear to them, to the Hou&s;e."</Q>
On the re&s;ult or effect of that evidence or any part of it, they had no authority to report an opinion. Nor could they have it otherwi&s;e than by expre&s;s terms in the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e. But, waving this objection, which <HI>in limine</HI> is deci&s;ive, let us con&s;ider a little what the declaration in it&s;elf amounts to, and, taken with all its circum&s;tances, what weight &s;hould be allowed to it. The Com|mittee &s;ay, that, <HI>on in&s;pection of the li&s;ts, &amp;c., they &s;ee no ground to &s;uppo&s;e that any interference has taken place, &amp;c.</HI> Be it &s;o.&mdash;Is that enough? Does the <HI>contrary</HI> appear from the evidence? If it does not, the negative propo&s;ition leaves its own que&s;tion untouched. I know very well that the li&s;ts, produced to the Committee, with re&s;pect to the interference in que&s;tion, prove nothing; and that the publication of them was &s;aid to be withheld for fear of injuring bankers and other per&s;ons in bu&s;ine&s;s, who were great &s;ub&s;cribers, and who might be &s;u&s;pected of not dividing fairly with their cu&s;|tomers. But, if you look into the Report, you will find that &s;ums little &s;hort of millions are &s;till covered by &s;ingle names, the di&s;tri|bution of which was never known to the Committee.</P>
<P>For one example out of many.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion to <HI>Mr. Gold&s;mid.</HI></P>
<P>Is the whole of the remainder, amounting to 3,492,000l. for your&s;elf only?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will you &s;tate to the Committee how much of that &s;um is for your&s;elf, and the names of the per&s;ons, among whom the re|mainder is di&s;tributed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 482,000l. is for my brother and my&s;elf. As to the re|maining 3,010,000l. I can't give up a li&s;t, <HI>as I was in honour bound not to do &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>With a number of &s;uch facts before us, is it po&s;&s;ible to contend that any affirmative proof ari&s;es, from an in&s;pection of the li&s;ts or any other part of the evidence, that <HI>no</HI> interference did take place, on the part of any per&s;ons connected with Government, in the di&s;|tribution of any part of the loan? But, unle&s;s that propo&s;ition be maintained, the opinion of the Committee is not only irregular, but u&s;ele&s;s and unavailing to the purpo&s;e, for which it was produced and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
in&s;i&s;ted on by the learned gentleman. The&s;e objections, in my judgement, are fatal to the opinion in it&s;elf. Let us &s;ee what im|portance it derives from the per&s;ons, who concurred in it. I am not &s;peaking of the formal con&s;titution of the Committee, but of the materials, of which it was in fact compo&s;ed. Individually without doubt the Members, who attended mo&s;t diligently, and who had an entire command of the proceedings, are entitled to all manner of con&s;ideration and re&s;pect. They are all honourable men, and, in proportion to their &s;en&s;e of honour, mo&s;t likely to be influenced in favour of their benefactor. I &s;hall de&s;cribe them by their &s;ta|tions only; and, that I may do even that without a ri&s;k of offence, I &s;hall &s;tate the ca&s;e in another form, &s;ufficient for my own pur|po&s;e, and not liable to an invidious con&s;truction. Suppo&s;e my right honourable friend near me had been Chancellor of the Exchequer, and that a que&s;tion had ari&s;en concerning the integrity of his conduct in &s;ome tran&s;action of his office. I a&s;k this Hou&s;e, I a&s;k every man of common &s;en&s;e, who hears me, whether the unanimous opinion of two Secretaries of the Trea&s;ury, of two Payma&s;ters General, and of twenty members of the Boards of Admiralty, Trea&s;ury and Controul, all appointed by him&s;elf, would have the weight of a feather to &s;atisfy the world, that his conduct had been pure and irreproachable? On this part of the &s;ubject I &s;hall only add, that my right honourable friend, whether guilty or innocent, has too much di&s;cernment and knowledge of the world, to rely on &s;uch mi&s;erable evidence for his acquittal. I &s;hall dwell but little on the other parts of the learned gentleman's &s;peech, be|cau&s;e it appears to me that the whole of it runs in a fal&s;e direction, and that, if his particular ob&s;ervations were ever &s;o true, they would not lead the Hou&s;e to a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion on the body and &s;ub&s;tance of the tran&s;action before us. In defence or behalf of the propo&s;ed re|&s;olutions, it would be in vain for me to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the learned gentleman. He has loudly declared that, <HI>whether true or fal&s;e,</HI> he was determined to reject them all. Again&s;t &s;o vigorous and in|trepid an effort of re&s;olution, I know it would be in vain to apply any arguments of mine; &s;o I &s;hall leave him undi&s;turbed in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He has &s;aid a great deal with great a&s;perity, and I think with no little inju&s;tice, again&s;t the credibility of Mr. Morgan's evidence, grounded on the extreme intere&s;t, which he &s;uppo&s;es Mr. Morgan to have had to mi&s;repre&s;ent &s;uch parts of the Mini&s;ter's conduct as affected him&s;elf, and to &s;tate them in his own favour. He has al&s;o taken pains to prove that Mr. Morgan was not injured, and had no rea&s;on to complain. Well, Sir, <HI>I,</HI> at lea&s;t have no per&s;onal intere&s;t in defending Mr. Morgan. I never &s;aw him be|fore
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the day when he fir&s;t attended the Committee, and then I mu&s;t confe&s;s that, in his temper and deportment, I &s;aw no indications of deep de&s;ign, of cool, thoughtful, guarded cunning. To judge of him by appearances, there never was a man &s;o little qualified by nature for the part of an impo&s;tor. He mu&s;t be an ideot indeed, who could be impo&s;ed upon by Mr. Morgan. I gave him credit for what he &s;aid, becau&s;e he &s;aid nothing but what was probable. On the other hand, if, with the mo&s;t unimpeached character, he had &s;tated things utterly improbable, his character alone would not have &s;ecured his evidence from &s;u&s;picion. In by much the greate&s;t part of it, he was &s;upported by the concurring te&s;timony of all the other witne&s;&s;es. On that a&s;&s;ertion, on which the learned gentleman denies that any credit is due to Mr. Morgan, and which, as he affirms, mu&s;t have been a mere after-thought and &s;ub&s;equent invention, when he knew the terms on which the loan was actu|ally &s;ettled with Mr. Boyd, viz.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that on the 25th of November, <HI>if he had been called upon on that day</HI> he would have offered tho&s;e terms for the loan, which he &s;tated to the Committee, and by which, if they had been accepted, an advantage of 499,500l. would have accrued to the Public,"</Q>
I, for one, declare mo&s;t &s;o|lemnly that I give Mr. Morgan entire credit. Becau&s;e I know that, on tho&s;e terms, the loan would &s;till have been extremely profitable to the &s;ub&s;cribers, and becau&s;e I have good rea&s;on to believe, from particular inquiry, that men of the fir&s;t property in the city would have been glad to have gone halves with Mr. Morgan in that bar|gain. I do not mean <HI>now,</HI> and with their <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> knowledge, but on the 25th of November and with all the circum&s;tances in their view, by which tran&s;actions of this &s;ort are commonly governed, as they actually &s;tood on that day. As to motives of a great intere&s;t, which might influence the te&s;timony, and le&s;&s;en the credit of Mr. Morgan, let it be remembered that all the competitors had an in|tere&s;t of the &s;ame kind, and full as con&s;iderable as he had. To believe by &s;election is mere partiality, and indicates an intere&s;t in the examiner ju&s;t as much as in the witne&s;s. But what is all this to the purpo&s;e? What have we to do with Mr. Morgan's intere&s;t, or with the injury, which, in his own opinion or any other, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uffered? The learned gentleman travels out of the record. In the re&s;olutions now propo&s;ed to you by the Chair|man of the Committee, there is not a &s;ingle word on either of tho&s;e points. The true and only object of inquiry both here and in the Committee is, whether the intere&s;t of the Public was or was not faithfully guarded by their repre&s;entative and tru&s;tee, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; whether the Public has or has not been e&s;&s;en|tially
<PB N="8" REF="7">
injured by any act or omi&s;&s;ion of his in the &s;ettlement of that loan, which he had at his &s;ole di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems Mr. Morgan is not to be credited, becau&s;e he &s;u&s;|pected the Chancellor of the Exchequer of collu&s;ion with Mr. Boyd? Was <HI>he</HI> the only per&s;on, to whom that &s;u&s;picion ocurred?&mdash;Look at the evidence of Mr. Melli&s;h. That gentleman's character at lea&s;t is un&s;u&s;pected.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When Mr. Boyd and Mr. Robarts were called out of the room at Mr. Pitt's, (on the 25th of November,) I had a &s;u&s;picion that it would not be by competition, and &s;aid, <HI>hey day!</HI> a Secret Committee!"</Q>
I believe, Sir, I &s;hall be able to make it appear that what then was &s;u&s;picion to Mr. Melli&s;h, &s;hould now be conviction to this Hou&s;e. The learned gentleman objects, with all po&s;&s;ible vehemence and indignation, to the two la&s;t Re&s;olutions, as if they contained propo&s;itions palpably fal&s;e or mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd. The former a&s;&s;erts, and to that part of it I confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, that the loan was a <HI>gift</HI> to Mr. Boyd. The evidence proves that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had uniformly profe&s;&s;ed and held up the principle of free and open com|petition, and who had invited the competitors to his hou&s;e to bid for the loan, did, on the 25th of November for the fir&s;t time, and after a &s;eparate conference with one of the parties, propo&s;e to the other competitors another principle of what is called a <HI>qualified</HI> com|petition, which they in&s;tantly refu&s;ed, and which the Governor of the Bank tells you, that <HI>in their place, he would not have accepted.</HI> Mr. Boyd &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We were very willing to leave the fixing of the price of the loan to the Chancellor of the Exchequer."</Q>
The Governor of the Bank &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Their an&s;wer was, that they would tru&s;t to Mr. Pitt's candour, and take it on his own terms."</Q>
And, <HI>in a few minutes,</HI> the loan was theirs. If this be not a gift, in all its effects, I &s;hould be curious to hear the learned gentleman's defi|nition of that word, and, &s;uppo&s;ing it a gift, in what terms he would de&s;cribe it. The learned gentleman does not deny the previous conference, alluded to in the third Re&s;olution, but he objects to cal|ling it <HI>&s;eparate.</HI> The epithet, it &s;eems, is invidious, and calculated to convey a fal&s;e idea of the conference, as if it had been <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> whereas it was held in pre&s;ence of the Governor and Deputy Go|vernor of the Bank.&mdash;True, it was &s;o. Still the conference was &s;e|parate, in the terms and meaning of the Re&s;olution. It was held with one of the parties, while the other two were excluded. The competitors were a&s;&s;embled, by appointment from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to bid for the loan, as they thought, on equal terms. The Governor of the Bank &s;ays, that on the 23d of November,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I a&s;ked him pointedly the que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it was to be by compe|tition?</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and he told me, <HI>certainly it would,</HI> and that I might tell the gentlemen;&mdash;and <HI>then</HI> my &s;u&s;picions were done away."</Q>
When the parties meet, the fir&s;t thing that happens, is a &s;eparate conference with one of them; the next, a propo&s;al to the other two to bid for the loan on terms incompatible with the principle of free and open competition.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the Re&s;olutions is that, which fills the learned gentle|man with particular indignation, which he can no way endure, and which he will not only negative, but &s;ub&s;titute another of his own in the room of it. Now, Sir, let this propo&s;ed Re&s;olution be ever &s;o defective, or ever &s;o fal&s;e and unju&s;t, he ought at all events to &s;tate it fairly. He a&s;ks, whether it be po&s;&s;ible to advance a propo&s;ition more extravagant and ab&s;urd, than that two millions and a half have been given to the contractors for the loan, and lo&s;t to the public. The learned gentleman is not very exact in &s;tating large &s;ums. For &s;hortne&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e, or to &s;ave time, or to &s;peak in round numbers, he always calls it two millions and a half, when the Re&s;olutions &s;pecify two millions one hundred and &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds. At this preci&s;e &s;um the Re&s;olutions e&s;timate <HI>the profits to the contributors at the expence of the nation;</HI> but do not &s;ay that it was given to the <HI>contractors,</HI> or that the whole of it was lo&s;t to the nation. Undoubtedly a fair and rea&s;onable profit to the con|tributors ought to be allowed and deducted. The remainder is evidently given away. But the <HI>whole</HI> premium is truly &s;tated as a profit to the contributor. There is no other way of de&s;cribing it. At 12 per cent. on eighteen millions it amounts to 2,160,000l. I know that at one period the premium on the loan ro&s;e to twelve and an half per cent., and that &s;ome of the principal holders of <HI>omnium</HI> did not &s;ell at that price or near it, as they might have done, becau&s;e they expected it to ri&s;e to fifteen or &s;ixteen; and &s;o it would without doubt, if the expectations, fallaciou&s;ly held out by the King's me&s;&s;age of the 8th of December, had not been de|feated by the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of Government. What the real intention of the me&s;&s;age was, I know not; but I know that it was calculated to an&s;wer a purpo&s;e, that it had a con&s;iderable effect, and that, &s;ince that time, the contents of it have been di&s;carded and forgotten.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now endeavour, Sir, to &s;tate to the Hou&s;e, as briefly and di&s;tinctly as I can, what in my judgment, <HI>are not,</HI> and then what <HI>are</HI> the true e&s;&s;ential points in i&s;&s;ue, between tho&s;e who applaud, and tho&s;e who condemn the conduct of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in this tran&s;action, and which alone de&s;erve the attention of the Hou&s;e. Every attempt to &s;hift the que&s;tion or the charge
<PB N="10" REF="9">
from its real ground is, in &s;ome degree, an admi&s;&s;ion. Men of experience and ability, who know the con&s;equence, would not re&s;ort to bad logic, or to fal&s;e ground, if they felt them&s;elves &s;trong, in fair and honourable argument, on the real merits of the &s;ubject. The line of examination, which the right honourable gentleman's friends ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ued in the Committee, tended to prove &s;ome propo&s;itions, which were not in di&s;pute. The honourable Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, I am &s;ure, will remember my having &s;aid expre&s;sly that the re&s;ult, though ever &s;o favourable to him, would be &s;uperfluous, that it was a defence without a charge, and that I cautioned him again&s;t the natural inference that mu&s;t be drawn from that mode of proceeding. They adhered to it in the Com|mittee, and they rely upon it in the debate. We &s;hall &s;ee with what effect. I a&s;&s;ert then that, admitting the learned gentleman to have <HI>proved,</HI> to his own entire &s;atisfaction, that there is no ground to &s;u&s;pect the Chancellor of the Exchequer of having turned the loan to his own account, or even of having di&s;tributed any portion of it among his friends in either Hou&s;e of Parliament, to reward or cor|rupt them, which for the pre&s;ent I neither affirm nor deny, he has proved nothing to the purpo&s;e. He has re&s;i&s;ted vigorou&s;ly where there was no attack, and exhibited great courage, where there was no danger. He knows very well how difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible it is, even in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t tran&s;actions, to obtain direct proof of cor|ruption between Mini&s;ters and Members of Parliament. He knows, or ought to know that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that &s;ort of charge was never attempted. My honourable friend, who moved the in|quiry, not only did not lay pro&s;titution or corruption to the charge of the Mini&s;ter, in the &s;en&s;e taken by the learned gentleman, but did expre&s;sly and repeatedly di&s;claim it. So did I and others in the Committee. Not that the contrary has by any means been made out in evidence. Of &s;uch propo&s;itions, the negative is full as difficult to prove, as the affirmative. We &s;aid, and we adhere to it, that it appeared to us that a mo&s;t improvident bargain had been made for the public. We &s;ay now, and we have proved it, that, <HI>in every part of the tran&s;action of the late loan, the public intere&s;t has been &s;acrificed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</HI> If I am a&s;ked, <HI>what could be his motives,</HI> my an&s;wer is that I cannot penetrate into the hearts of men, or judge of their intentions otherwi&s;e than by facts and circum&s;tances, and by a compari&s;on between conduct and profe&s;|&s;ions; but that in this ca&s;e, in my opinion, &s;ufficient ground is laid for all the conclu&s;ions drawn by the Re&s;olutions. That point &s;hall be con&s;idered in its place. If I am a&s;ked, whether I &s;u&s;pect the right ho|nourable gentleman of per&s;onal corruption in this bu&s;ine&s;s? I an&s;wer
<PB N="11" REF="10">
frankly and without re&s;erve, No. I &s;corn to in&s;inuate what I do not believe. Neither do I pretend to have ground to believe that the loan was di&s;tributed among the Members of this Hou&s;e, and therefore, I &s;ay nothing on that head. The di&s;tribution, <HI>in the city of London,</HI> &s;peaks for it&s;elf. In that quarter undoubtedly, I &s;u&s;pect that corrup|tion was intended, becau&s;e I &s;ee the effect. I &s;ee an exorbitant profit given, and a corre&s;ponding conduct in tho&s;e, who received it. <HI>But the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his own per&s;on, is immaculate! You may prove any thing el&s;e; but, &s;ince you cannot prove that he kept a &s;hare in the loan for his own u&s;e, your objections and your charges &s;ignify no|thing.</HI> That is, we have proved nothing, becau&s;e we have not proved what we did not alledge. But after all, Sir, is it much to &s;ay, for a man in his elevated &s;ituation, for a man of his under|&s;tanding, that he is not vile enough and fool enough to take money in his office! Could he do it, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a middle man, of an agent? Mu&s;t he not employ a banyan; and if he tru&s;ted him&s;elf to a third per&s;on in a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o full of danger and difficulty, mu&s;t he not be at once in the power of that per&s;on, and his &s;lave for ever? In all the&s;e tran&s;actions, there is undoubt|edly a clear, available profit to the Mini&s;ter. But who is it &s;u&s;|pects him of taking it in &s;pecie? The thing is morally impo&s;&s;ible. I acquit him on his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In all the preceding ob&s;ervations, Sir, I have intended little more than to clear the ground, and open my way to the body of the que&s;tion. I &s;hall &s;tate it now in the only form in which I think it ought to be &s;tated to a popular a&s;&s;embly, and in which I can hope to make my&s;elf under&s;tood. Minute cal|culations of pounds or pence would not be attended to, nor would they be intelligible, at lea&s;t with any explanations of mine. I may not &s;ucceed in a&s;certaining the preci&s;e motives, on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has acted. But that he has acted on motives incon&s;i&s;tent with his duty, and that he has wilfully &s;a|crificed the public intere&s;t, (in &s;uch a man I cannot attribute any thing to ignorance or &s;urpri&s;e,) of which he was the appointed guardian, the &s;pecial tru&s;tee,&mdash;the&s;e propo&s;itions, I am &s;ure I can make out. By what evidence? By a concurrence of undi&s;puted facts and of circum&s;tances, which cannot lie, and all of them meet|ing in one central point, the profit of the contractors. I &s;hall bring them together as clo&s;ely, and compare them as accurately as I can; and then let it be &s;een whether, &s;o collected and &s;o compared, they do not amount to a moral proof, whether they do not force you to a conclu&s;ion, which, whatever you may &s;ay, the human mind is not made to re&s;i&s;t. Judgment is not yet at the command of voli|tion.
<PB N="12" REF="11">
If it were, the right honourable gentleman undoubtedly would be as &s;ecure of the e&s;teem, as he is of the partiality of this Hou&s;e. On the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, it is not within the limits of po&s;&s;ibi|lity, that their inclination and their judgment &s;hould really go toge|ther. Now, Sir, I reque&s;t the Hou&s;e, in ob&s;erving the facts, to be attentive to the dates. I need not &s;top to prove that, to a&s;cer|tain the quality of human actions, the date is very often an e&s;&s;ential part of the fact. I &s;hall &s;tate nothing, in point of fact, but what is proved and admitted. Fir&s;t, Till the 23d of November 1795 it appears that the Chancellor of the Exchequer adhered to the prin|ciple, which he had uniformly profe&s;&s;ed, of free and open com|petition, and that, until the 25th of November, he did never expre&s;s an intention of departing from that principle. Second, By the evidence, on which the eleventh Re&s;olution is founded, it appears that Mr. Boyd's &s;uppo&s;ed right to object to the negociation of a new loan, was &s;tated to the Chancellor of the Exche|quer &s;ome time in October, and that he promi&s;ed to &s;end to Mr. Boyd and his party, to hear what they had to &s;ay, before any com|petition &s;hould take place, but that, at that time, <HI>he &s;eemed po&s;itively determined not to admit of their claim.</HI> He never &s;ent for Mr. Boyd. On the 23d of November he &s;till adhered to his plan of free and open competition, and invited the competi|tors to meet him on the 25th, in order to bid on that princi|ple. The Hou&s;e will ob&s;erve that I &s;peak of facts, as they appear on the &s;urface of the evidence, not as I think they really were. After being reminded of his engagement to Mr. Boyd, fir&s;t in a con|ver&s;ation, and then by a letter of the 24th of November; he &s;ays, on the 25th, that the circum&s;tances had come, <HI>but recently,</HI> to his knowledge, and that he did not admit any obligation to exi&s;t. He &s;eems to have forgotten not only his original engagement to Mr. Boyd, but the revival of it in October; and indeed, not to have been very much &s;truck with the force of it, when it was again de|tailed to him on the 24th of November. Let us con&s;ider a little what this right and claim is, which appears to have made &s;o very &s;light an impre&s;&s;ion on the memory and judgment of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but to which at la&s;t he &s;ubmits without re&s;i&s;tance, as if he were &s;uddenly overpowered by a torrent of conviction. In this place, Sir, it may be proper for me to premi&s;e, that whatever I &s;ay on the&s;e points is meant to be exclu&s;ively applied to the Mini&s;ter. I have the plea&s;ure of knowing Mr. Boyd, and &s;hall always &s;peak of him as I think, with the greate&s;t con&s;ideration.&mdash;Fir&s;t of all I find, from Mr. Boyd's letter,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the contract, for the loan of la&s;t year, was entered into under the <HI>condition,</HI> that no
<PB N="13" REF="12">
other public loan for this country &s;hould be made until the period, fixed for the la&s;t payment of the loan then contracted for, &s;hould have elap&s;ed."</Q>
Here the claim begins with a po&s;itive condition, which, if it could be proved, would make all general arguments &s;uperfluous. Mr. Boyd allows that it was not reduced to a &s;pecific form, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has no recollection of it. In a que&s;tion of mere fact, between him and Mr. Boyd, tho' rather too material to be readily forgotten, I am willing to allow him the full benefit of a feeble memory. But ob&s;erve what the nature and qualities of this right are, and then believe it, if you can, that a right, &s;o founded and &s;o qualified, &s;hould have e&s;caped the at|tention of &s;uch a man as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or that, when it was revived and brought back to his view, it &s;hould have made &s;o very &s;light an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. Mr. Boyd &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>it is a right founded in ju&s;tice.</HI>"</Q> You may not remember an engage|ment; but ju&s;tice, though often violated, is not quite &s;o ea&s;ily for|gotten. This right is al&s;o founded <HI>in the nature of things.</HI> A curi|ous de&s;cription certainly of a claim to lend money, from a con|tractor to a Chancellor of the Exchequer. Or is it one of the rights of man newly imported from Paris? But it al&s;o par|takes of the quality of a metaphy&s;ical right. Mr. Boyd con|tends, that it was <HI>inherent and inalienable</HI> in him as <HI>contractor</HI>; that, in that character, he could not &s;eparate him&s;elf from it, and that, as &s;uch, his right and he were indi&s;&s;olubly attached to one another, and would have continued &s;o, though he &s;hould have parted with all his &s;hare in the loan, or even tho' he never &s;hould have held any part of it, but only have acted as agent for the other contributors; and tho' he him&s;elf admits, that the contractors for the loan of 1795, could not &s;uffer any pecuniary lo&s;s by the intro|duction of a new loan, otherwi&s;e than as holders of &s;crip. His own words are,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But I do not under&s;tand that, while I &s;ell or alienate a part of the loan, I transfer any of the inalienable and inherent right, which belongs exclu&s;ively to me as a <HI>contractor.</HI>"</Q>
This to me, I confe&s;s, Sir, is a new &s;peculation, and therefore it is po&s;&s;ible that I may not be a proper judge of it. But this I know, that all the witne&s;&s;es concur in a very different opinion, viz. that as there could be no pecuniary lo&s;s but to the holders of &s;crip, all the contributors to the loan of 1795 had as good a claim, as the contractors, to a preference for the &s;ucceeding loan, in proportion to the amount of the &s;hares in the loan of 1795, then held by them re&s;pectively, and that not one of them, on that principle at lea&s;t, appears to have been con&s;idered in the pre&s;ent loan.</P>
<P>But leaving this problem to &s;hift for it&s;elf, you will find
<PB N="14" REF="13">
that the right, &s;o claimed by the contractor, has been <HI>recogni&s;ed by con&s;tant practice and public opinion.</HI> Here comes a que&s;tion of fact. Has it been the <HI>con&s;tant practice</HI>? If it has, you have a cu&s;tom without an in&s;tance. No &s;imilar ca&s;e has been &s;tated. No example has been alledged to make good the affirmative. The truth is, that there never was a precedent in point. The Governor of the Bank &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he does not recollect any loan made for the receipts to come out before the others were totally extinct, and that Mr. Newland had looked back a great way, but, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Bank, no new loan has been made, when two pay|ments of the preceding one were not fulfilled, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e."</Q>
The a&s;&s;erted right of the contractor is therefore clearly not founded <HI>on con&s;tant practice.</HI> But it would be treating &s;uch a propo&s;ition too gently, if I contented my&s;elf with &s;aying, that it has not been proved. There is a deci&s;ive fact on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, which annihilates the allegation of <HI>practice.</HI> Allow me to &s;tate this point di&s;tinctly. The moment you under&s;tand it, you mu&s;t be convinced by it. The contractors &s;ay they cannot re|linqui&s;h their right, <HI>without evident lo&s;s.</HI> How are they to lo&s;e? As holders of &s;crip belonging to the former loan, <HI>by the introduction of eighteen millions more into the market.</HI> But if you look to the evidence, you will find there is one opinion, in which all the wit|ne&s;&s;es agree, viz, to &s;peak in the terms of the fourteenth Re&s;olu|tion,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the value of the exi&s;ting funds is affected in a far greater degree by the <HI>negociation</HI> for a new loan, and the &s;ettle|ment of the terms thereof, than by the making the depo&s;it on &s;uch loan after it is &s;ettled."</Q>
Mr. Boyd him&s;elf expre&s;sly objects to the <HI>negociation</HI> of a new loan, while payments on the former loan were depending; becau&s;e undoubtedly, if injury be done to the holders of &s;crip, it mu&s;t be by the <HI>negociation and terms,</HI> not by the depo&s;it. Now, Sir, &s;uppo&s;ing this to be the truth, as it certainly is, it appears by the evidence, in oppo&s;ition to that <HI>con&s;tant practice and opi|nion,</HI> alledged by Mr. Boyd, that, before all the payments were completed on the loan for 1794, a new loan for 1795 was negoci|ated with Mr. Boyd, while con&s;iderable &s;ums of the preceding loan were out&s;tanding; yet the contributors to that loan did not object to &s;uch negociation, or make any complaint on account of it. You will find the fact more preci&s;ely &s;tated in the 15th Re&s;olution. I am not arguing now about the validity of Mr. Boyd's pretentions to a preference; but, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be good, in the &s;en&s;e and to the effect &s;tated; is it po&s;&s;ible they could be forgotten? Or, if they were not valid, why did they prevail? It would not be difficult to a&s;&s;ign a probable motive for the Mini&s;ter's conduct; but, as it
<PB N="15" REF="14">
would be &s;aid to amount to nothing but &s;u&s;picion or conjecture, I &s;hall leave it to every man, who ob&s;erves the facts, to conclude for him&s;elf. There are &s;till &s;ome material circum&s;tances in this tran|&s;action, very well worthy of your attention. Mr. Boyd obtains the preference, if not, as we call it, a <HI>gift</HI> of the loan. What follows? <HI>He tru&s;ts to the candour</HI> of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and agrees to take it on <HI>his own terms.</HI> What precedes?&mdash;A &s;in|gular fact. In the beginning of November, for the fir&s;t time, the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to buy up the public debt, began to make purcha&s;es in the 4 per cent. &s;tock. The bargain for the loan was fixed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer him&s;elf in the 3 per cents only. That is, he did every thing, that depended on him, to lower the value of that commodity which he meant to di&s;po&s;e of. The 4 per cents ro&s;e of cour&s;e, by this new and unexpected inve&s;t|ment of more than half a million in ready money. Whatever that advantage amounted to, ought to have been given to the 3 per cents, in which the bargain for the loan was concluded. The learned gentleman &s;ays that, in November 1795, the purcha&s;es by the commi&s;&s;ioners could not be made in the 3 per cent annuities; be|cau&s;e, in that month the books of tho&s;e annuities were &s;hut. So they were in 1794. So they were in every preceding year. The times, at which the &s;everal books are &s;hut, in all the funds re&s;|pectively, never vary. Did that difficulty occur in 1794 or 1793? Did the Commi&s;&s;ioners ever purcha&s;e in the 4 per cents, before November la&s;t? Never. Again I &s;ay, what follows the &s;ettle|ment of the loan? Another fact, mo&s;t &s;ingular in its appearance, mo&s;t important in its effect. The Chancellor of the Exchequer makes the bargain on the 25th of November, but does not bring forward the budget till the 7th of December. On the length of that interval and its con&s;equences, I &s;hall ob&s;erve pre&s;ently. But here comes the que&s;tionable point of all. The very day after the budget, the Mini&s;ter delivers a me&s;&s;age from His Maje&s;ty, from which all men concluded, that a negociation for peace was on foot or very likely to take place The value of the loan immediately ro&s;e above 5 per cent, or 900,000l. on the capital, which we affirm was to all intents and purpo&s;es a voluntary, determined, and premeditated gift to the contractors at the expence of the public. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer &s;hould alledge that this effect of the me&s;&s;age was not to be fore&s;een, or that in fact he did not fore&s;ee it, I &s;hall leave the fir&s;t of tho&s;e allegations to the judgment of the Hou&s;e, and of the world; the &s;econd I &s;hall not contradict. They, who take him at his word, mu&s;t defend his integrity at the expence of his &s;agacity, on a point that could not e&s;cape the meane&s;t under|&s;tanding.
<PB N="16" REF="15">
In &s;o gro&s;s a mi&s;take, it is not po&s;&s;ible that common &s;en&s;e and common hone&s;ty &s;hould have acted together. Of the effect at lea&s;t, there can be no doubt. No man will deny that, if he had timed and graduated the&s;e &s;everal acts as he ought to have done, I mean the loan, the budget, and the me&s;&s;age; the public might have had the benefit of that advance in the funds, which was produced by the me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The 29th Re&s;olution &s;tates, in moderate terms, that the interval of twelve days, between the &s;ettlement and the budget, is unu&s;ual, and not likely to be productive of any advantage to the Public. The fact is that, by any delay of the budget after the bargain, the Public cannot po&s;&s;ibly gain, but may po&s;&s;ibly lo&s;e. With re&s;pect to the contractors, the direct rever&s;e is the ca&s;e. If, in that protracted interval, political events of a favourable na|ture &s;hould happen, by which the price of &s;tocks &s;hould be con|&s;iderably advanced, the contractor has the whole benefit of the ri&s;e. Whereas, if the contrary &s;hould happen, whether by misfortunes abroad, or any other &s;ini&s;ter event; and if, in con&s;equence, the loan, in&s;tead of bearing a premium of ten or twelve per cent, &s;hould fall con&s;iderably under par, what remedy has the Public again&s;t the contractors? or would they, if they could, enforce the contract to the ruin of the parties? No, Sir, we all know that it would not be attempted. The learned gentleman admits, with truth and candour, that Parliament, in &s;uch a ca&s;e of pure mis|fortune, would relieve the contractor. I &s;ay they would, becau&s;e they ought to do &s;o. For rea&s;ons of this nature, it was formerly the con&s;tant rule not to conclude the bargain 'till the day before the budget. Even in later times, the interval has &s;eldom exceeded two days. Suppo&s;ing that, in a political view, it might have been ad|vi&s;able to conclude the bargain for the loan at &s;o very early a period of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, why did not the budget immediately follow? If otherwi&s;e, why might not the bargain have waited for the budget? On this point, one argument only has been urged, with a great deal of pomp and empha&s;is, namely, that it was good policy to take the earlie&s;t moment po&s;&s;ible, after the meeting of Parliament, to exhibit to the enemy the extent of our re&s;ources, and the faci|lity, with which the enormous capital of eighteen millions &s;terling could &s;till be rai&s;ed in this country. It does not yet appear that this eager exhibition of our extravagance has made any material impre&s;&s;ion on the enemy. As far as I can di&s;cover, they have not yet been much appalled by it. But, be it &s;o. Allow the policy to be good, whether in this in&s;tance it &s;ucceeded or not. How will the right honourable gentleman an&s;wer this que&s;tion? If the po|licy
<PB N="17" REF="16">
was good in November 1795, it may be &s;o equally in No|vember 1796. Then why have you now, for the fir&s;t time, in|troduced into the contract for the pre&s;ent loan a &s;pecific &s;tipulation, <HI>that no payment on any new loan &s;hall be made 'till after the la&s;t pay|ment on this loan, that is, till after the</HI> 15<HI>th of December</HI> 1796? How do you know that, before that day, it may not be indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e another loan for the public &s;ervice? On your own principles, you have di&s;armed your Government of a powerful weapon, or at lea&s;t of an in&s;trument of terror, from which, as you contend, a great effect might be expected. Let the ca&s;e be ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, let the opportunity be ever &s;o favourable, your hands are tied. You cannot re&s;ort to your own remedy with|out a&s;king leave of the pre&s;ent contractors; that is, you mu&s;t buy their con&s;ent by the gift of another loan, which they in their turn <HI>will tru&s;t to the Mini&s;ter's candour, and take it on his own terms.</HI></P>
<P>On the curious tran&s;action of the Hamburgh bills, which, I be|lieve, will furni&s;h a clue to unravel the my&s;teries of the loan, I purpo&s;ely re&s;train my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, an honourable gentleman near me having engaged to make it the object of a particular inquiry, as it richly de&s;erves. One ob&s;ervation only is too pre&s;&s;ing to be omitted. The learned gentleman in&s;i&s;ts on the clear and unque&s;tionable fair|ne&s;s of the mea&s;ure, though unu&s;ual in the mode. Now, I a&s;k him whether, when the&s;e bills were brought into circulation, the true nature of them was avowed? Was the di&s;counter inform|ed, that the place and date were fictitious; that they were drawn in London in September, though dated from Hamburgh in Augu&s;t? If not, the di&s;counter was impo&s;ed upon. I do not &s;ay that the intention was to defraud, but it certainly was to deceive him. If the truth had been declared, would any banker have ri&s;qued the credit of his Hou&s;e by di&s;counting &s;uch bills? It does not appear that they were ever offered to the Bank of England.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I call upon the Hou&s;e to put together the facts, the circum&s;tances, the con&s;equences and pretences of the Mini&s;ter's conduct in this extraordinary tran&s;action, and, leaving out of their con&s;ideration the collu&s;ion that appears, or the motives that may be &s;u&s;pected, to pronounce their verdict, on the &s;imple i&s;&s;ue of fact,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Has he or has he not made a mo&s;t improvident bargain for the Public?"</Q>
If the fact be found, the moral inference is obvious and unavoidable. It need not be argued, for it cannot be re&s;i&s;ted. Neverthele&s;s, Sir, &s;peaking now for my&s;elf alone, I declare that I am ready to wave every one of the objections I have &s;tated, and even to join with his friends in a vote of acquittal, if the Mini&s;ter can and will give me a fair, direct, and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to one

remaining que&s;tion. When Melli&s;h and Morgan refu&s;ed to bid on the plan of a qualified competition propo&s;ed to them on the 25th of November, for what rea&s;on did he in&s;tantly conclude with Mr. Boyd? He was not pre&s;&s;ed for time, &s;ince Friday the 27th was the day, fixed by him&s;elf, for the final &s;ettlement. He was not pre&s;&s;ed for money, &s;ince the fir&s;t payment on the new loan was not required before the 10th of December. For any thing that appears to the contrary, he might have taken a week, but certainly two days, without any po&s;&s;ible inconvenience, to try at lea&s;t, whe|ther &s;ome other competitors might not offer, and by that means give the Public a po&s;&s;ible chance of the benefit of a competition on his own plan. Then why did he not immediately &s;end to the Bank, and de&s;ire the Governor to give public notice of the alteration, and of his being open, for a certain number of days, to receive pro|po&s;als on that principle? I pre&s;ume he will not &s;ay that he knew it to be &s;uch, as no man of credit would offer to bid upon. Yet what el&s;e he can &s;ay, to cover &s;o gro&s;s and palpable a breach of his duty to the Public&mdash;I confe&s;s my imbecillity&mdash;I have taxed my imagination&mdash;but I am not able to conceive it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t appeal I &s;hall make is to the prudence of the Hou&s;e. We are tru&s;tees for the nation, and accountable for the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in us. If we acted only for our&s;elves, or if the que&s;tion ended with a few &s;peeches, a &s;hort que&s;tion, and a vigorous re&s;o|lution, the Chancellor of the Exchequer might po&s;&s;ibly be as &s;afe in the opinion of his country, as he is in this Hou&s;e. But let it be remembered, before we decide, that the evidence is before the Public, who will compare it with the verdict and judge of us ac|cordingly. We may acquit the Mini&s;ter by a vote; but, if that vote &s;hould not appear to be warranted by the evidence, it will avail him nothing in point of reputation. The country have it in their power to try <HI>us</HI> as well as <HI>him.</HI> The Mini&s;ter may e&s;cape; but, in the judgement of mankind, this Hou&s;e will not be acquitted.</P>
