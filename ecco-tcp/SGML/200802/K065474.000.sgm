Which may well and u&s;efully be applied, to the Collecting and Pre|&s;erving the Accounts of the <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>Good Men: Men</HI> who in their Day, have been eminently u&s;eful in tho&s;e Stations of Life, wherein <HI>God,</HI> by his good <HI>Providence,</HI> hath placed them. And this pre&s;erving, by <HI>Publication,</HI> is the rather to be done, when them&s;elves do leave behind them, in Writing, an <HI>Ac|count</HI> of their <HI>Lives,</HI> and of the <HI>&s;ignal Mercies of God</HI> to them therein: For
<PB N="4" REF="3">
from &s;uch <HI>Accounts,</HI> may be&s;t be gather|ed, by the <HI>Reader,</HI> the Man's <HI>particular State, Exerci&s;e</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> in the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> out of the <HI>Fall</HI> and <HI>Dege|neracy:</HI> And, in the Reading thereof, be not only excited to <HI>Ble&s;s the Name of the Lord,</HI> on his behalf; but al&s;o gain &s;ome direction from the <HI>Path,</HI> &s;o fairly tract out, and ground of <HI>Hope;</HI> that by be|ing <HI>Faithful,</HI> they may likewi&s;e attain to the &s;ame good <HI>Experience.</HI></P>
<P>There is not with me any doubt, but &s;omething of this kind may be the Lot of many, into who&s;e Hands this <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> may happen to come; for that they will herein meet with variety of <HI>Exerci&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Providences</HI> of God therein, all related with great &s;trength and plainne&s;s of Speech: Our <HI>Decea&s;ed</HI> Friend <HI>Thomas Ellwood,</HI> having been a Man whom God had endued with <HI>&s;ingular Abilities,</HI> both as a <HI>Man,</HI> and as a <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> which is e|vident, not only from this &s;hort Account of his <HI>Life,</HI> which was written by him|&s;elf, and by the <HI>Supplement</HI> added here|unto;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
but more largely from his many u&s;eful Labours and Services in the ma|ny Books which he writ in the Defence of <HI>Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Friends</HI> thereof: For which <HI>Service</HI> he was in a particular manner qualified, by <HI>Spiritual Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Obedience;</HI> to which, in him, was added great &s;trength and depth of <HI>Judgment,</HI> wherein he could di&s;cern the Spirits of others, and was very much the Ma&s;ter of his own, as did appear to &s;uch who knew him, not only by the &s;oundne&s;s of his <HI>Rea&s;oning,</HI> and the Sea|&s;onablene&s;s of his <HI>Words;</HI> but al&s;o by his great and exemplary <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> in that he was not ha&s;ty to <HI>propo&s;e,</HI> nor rudely tenacious to in&s;i&s;t on what he had propo&s;ed; if any thing, though not well expre&s;t, yet well intended, was offered by any one much Weaker; nay, though but by a <HI>Babe</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Countenance</HI> was Manly and Chear|ful; His <HI>Deportment</HI> Grave, yet Affable and Courteous, even to the meane&s;t Per|&s;on; His Conver&s;ation Innocent, Plea&s;ant

and In&s;tructive, yet &s;evere again&s;t any thing that was beyond the Liberty of <HI>Truth.</HI> The&s;e, with his other Qualifica|tions of <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mind,</HI> did render him both very Acceptable and very U&s;eful, as a <HI>Friend,</HI> as a <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and as a <HI>Member</HI> and <HI>Elder</HI> in the <HI>Church of Chri&s;t;</HI> and the more, for that his Time was chiefly Imployed in being Service|able in one or other of the&s;e <HI>Capacities.</HI></P>
<P>I might here particularly mention the &s;everal <HI>Labours</HI> of our <HI>Decea&s;ed Friend,</HI> according to their re&s;pective Times, and the Nature of their &s;everal Subjects; but much of this being already done in the en&s;uing Pages, I chu&s;e to remit the <HI>Reader</HI> thither; by which po&s;&s;ibly he may be excited to the Peru&s;al of them, and &s;hall only &s;ay concerning them, <HI>that the Judicious Reader will ea&s;ily Ob&s;erve, that his Method and Stile do denote him to have been a Scholar: And yet not farther &s;o, than the Simplicity and Purity of the</HI> Truth, <HI>whereof he made Profe&s;&s;ion, would permit him.</HI></P>

<HEAD>George Bowles <HI>his</HI> TESTIMONY <HI>Concerning</HI> Thomas Ellwood.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is in my Heart briefly, on this Occa&s;ion, to com|memorate the <HI>tender Dealings</HI> of the Lord with his People in this latter Age of the World, when it hath plea&s;ed him, in Love to poor lo&s;t Man, graci|ou&s;ly to appear, by the breaking forth of his <HI>Glorious Go&s;pel Day.</HI> And by the &s;ecret divine Reaches of the Hand of God, which hath been felt and &s;een in the Light of it, many have been drawn in their Spi|rits to &s;eek after the Lord, and to enquire after the Knowledge of the Way of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Salvation;</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Name, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by the In&s;hinings of this <HI>Divine Light</HI> in the Hearts of many, to expel the <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and rend the <HI>Vail.</HI> And then was the Arm of his mighty Power made bare, for the gathering many Thou&s;ands to the &s;av|ing <HI>Knowledge of Him&s;elf.</HI> And in that Day was the Lord plea&s;ed according to his Promi&s;e, to <HI>pour forth of his Spirit upon Sons and upon Daugh|ters;</HI> yea, upon Servants and upon Handmaids, and many were made to Prophe&s;ie; and being qua|lified by the Holy Spirit, which they received, and were baptized by it into his Name, became willing, and were freely given up in Obedience to the Lord, and in Bowels of tender Love to the Souls of Man|kind, in his Power, to preach the Go&s;pel of Life and Salvation to tho&s;e to whom they were &s;ent, and ma|ny
<PB N="10" REF="8">
were turned from <HI>Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</HI> by their Mini&s;try: Among&s;t whom our dear decea&s;ed Friend and Bro|ther, <HI>THOMAS ELLWOOD,</HI> was one, who&s;e Con|&s;cience was reached and awakened by the Powerful Mini&s;try of dear <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI> as I have heard him relate (and as by the following Sheets will more plainly appear.) And of that Day and Time, and the worthy In&s;trument by who&s;e Mini&s;try he was Con|vinced, and turned unto God, and made &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>Divine Principle</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> in his own Heart, have I heard him &s;peak with great Regard; and al&s;o of the Sufferings which did attend him after he received the Truth in his Father's Family, for the Truth's &s;ake: and how the Lord pre&s;erved him in that time, under the various Exerci&s;es, which he pa&s;&s;ed through for Truth's Te&s;timony; which for Chri&s;t's &s;ake he was Con&s;cientiou&s;ly Concerned to &s;tand in, according to that Plainne&s;s and Simplici|ty which Truth then led, and &s;till continues to lead the &s;incere Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t into, by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the World; and, for the &s;ake thereof, they were de&s;pi&s;ed of Men, and hated of the World. Such was the Plain Langu|age of <HI>Thou</HI> to one, and refu&s;ing the <HI>Hat-Ho|nour;</HI> For which, Dear <HI>T. E.</HI> &s;uffered not a lit|tle in that Day, as, by the following Account of his Life more fully appears. And it were well if all, who come up in a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Ble&s;&s;ed Truth in this Time, were Faithful in the&s;e, and in the other Branches of its Te&s;timony. And let all con|&s;ider, that the neglecting thereof, is, in a Degree,
<PB N="11" REF="9">
a making void the Sufferings of the Faithful (and &s;trengthening the Hands of Evil Doers) who for the &s;ake of their <HI>Te&s;timony, loved not their Lives to the Death;</HI> but underwent cruel <HI>Mock|ings, Buffetings, Stonings, Whippings, Stock|ings, Revilings, Impri&s;onments,</HI> and <HI>Spoiling of Goods;</HI> Rejoycing in the Lord, that they were counted worthy to Suffer, either le&s;s or more, for his Name &s;ake. In re&s;pect of which, this my dear <HI>Friend</HI> was a good Example, he being a Man of a &s;teady <HI>Mind,</HI> and very patient in <HI>Suffering,</HI> as well as Faithful in his Te&s;timony for <HI>Truth,</HI> and took joyfully the Spoiling of his <HI>Goods,</HI> wherein he was tryed but a few Years before his Death. He was often Concerned in Defence of Truth's Te&s;timony, both again&s;t our Profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> and al&s;o again&s;t the <HI>Libertine Spirit</HI> which appeared in &s;ome, Profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Truth with us, who Op|po&s;ed them&s;elves again&s;t that good Order and Di&s;ci|pline which the <HI>Truth</HI> led <HI>Friends</HI> into. All which will abundantly appear from the Books them&s;elves, which are in Print, which he writ upon <HI>Various Occa&s;ions,</HI> and upon <HI>Divers Subjects;</HI> and let not his great Labour and Indu&s;try be Forgotten, in his writing tho&s;e Two Hi&s;torical Volumes, relating to the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;tament:</HI> A Work truly Great, and is, and may be of great U&s;e and Ser|vice. By all which his many Labours, it may be perceived by the wary and inlightned <HI>Reader,</HI> that the Lord had Endowed him with an excellent Gift, and Qualified him for the Service of Truth, his Church and People; in which he imployed the Ta|lent
<PB N="12" REF="10">
which the bountiful Lord had given him, to the Honour of the great Giver, and to the Com|fort and Edification of the Church of Chri&s;t: But more e&s;pecially were his Services known to the <HI>Bre|thren</HI> in this County of <HI>Bucks;</HI> Mo&s;t of which are fallen a&s;leep, and but few remaining here, who knew him in his beginning, or his fir&s;t Services for the Lord, his Church and People; among&s;t whom he was a Zealous A&s;&s;erter of that excellent Di&s;ci|pline the Lord had opened in, and led his People to, for the pre&s;erving his Church as a Garden en|clo&s;ed: for which cau&s;e how did many of tho&s;e <HI>Liber|tines</HI> &s;et them&s;elves fiercely again&s;t him, and &s;hot their Arrows at him; but the Lord Defended him, and covered his Head in the <HI>Day of Battle, and his Bow abode in Strength, and his Bough &s;pread over the Wall, and continued fre&s;h and green:</HI> But a Bla&s;t from the Lord came upon their Evil Work; And how have they melted away? And how is their Strength failed, and their Work brought to Naught? But the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord is with his People, even with the Faithful, to this Day, whom he hath pre&s;erved as a peculiar Trea|&s;ure to him&s;elf: Ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Name for ever|more. And furthermore, it may be truly &s;aid of this our dear Friend, that as the Lord fitted him for his Service, &s;o was he eminently &s;erviceable in his Hand, in the Church of Chri&s;t; particularly in the&s;e Parts, of which there are many Living Witne&s;&s;es, in this and the adjacent Counties, of his great Labour of Love, having &s;erved the Church Freely, with great Diligence and Faithfulne&s;s: The true &s;en&s;e of which,

<P>And my Dear <HI>Friends, Brethren,</HI> and <HI>Si&s;ters,</HI> although it be matter of Sorrow to us, to part with our Dear <HI>Friends;</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch as have been

made Serviceable in their Day, and have faith|fully &s;erved the Lord and his People in their Ge|neration, as it may (I hope without ju&s;t occa&s;ion of Offence to any) be &s;aid of dear <HI>T.

When I came fir&s;t to him, which was &s;oon after I heard of his being taken ill, which was the 24th day of the 2d Month, I found him very much di&s;|abled by the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> which was thought to be a <HI>Pal&s;ie,</HI> that had &s;eized him, e&s;pecially on his right Side, &s;o that he could not &s;tand alone, nor help him&s;elf, but a little with his left Hand; and his Speech was al&s;o very much interrupted, in&s;omuch that it was with great difficulty, for the mo&s;t part, that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o as to be Under&s;tood: Some time after I came to him, there being al&s;o other

And I am fully &s;atisfied, he laid down his Head in Peace with the Lord, and is gathered to his everla&s;ting Re&s;t.

became a <HI>Sufferer;</HI> not only by <HI>Impri&s;onment,</HI> for <HI>Wor&s;hipping God</HI> in the A&s;&s;emblies of his People, but al&s;o, from his <HI>Father,</HI> by whom he was made as an <HI>Outca&s;t,</HI> for no other Cau&s;e, but for his Faithful <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> in taking up the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> to the <HI>Worlds Be|haviour</HI> and <HI>Language:</HI> Whereupon he was Invited by his much valued Friend <HI>I&s;aac Penington,</HI> to his Hou&s;e; where he abode &s;everal Years, until he <HI>Mar|ried.</HI> He was a Ble&s;&s;ing in, as well as a great Com|fort and Help to that <HI>Family;</HI> and by his wi&s;e Conduct therein, gained much <HI>E&s;teem,</HI> not only from the <HI>El|ders,</HI> but the <HI>Youth,</HI> whom he In&s;tructed in <HI>Learn|ing;</HI> and though mo&s;t of them are by <HI>Death</HI> Removed, yet One &s;till Remains, who from Certain and Experi|mental Knowledge, can Commemorate his <HI>Worth;</HI> being engaged thereto, from a Sen&s;e of the <HI>Benefit</HI> of his Good and Whol&s;om <HI>Advice,</HI> given at <HI>Sundry Times,</HI> and on <HI>Divers Occa&s;ions.</HI> Which Friend&s;hip continued firm to the La&s;t.</P>
<P>His <HI>Natural Capacity</HI> was large, and his <HI>Under|&s;tanding,</HI> in the <HI>things of God,</HI> very deep; which excellent Qualifications meeting in one, rendred him u&s;eful beyond many, to his <HI>Country,</HI> as well as very &s;er|viceable in the <HI>Church;</HI> by both which he is, and will be greatly mi&s;&s;ed.

<P>His Sickne&s;s was &s;udden, which &s;oon deprived him of the u&s;e of his <HI>Limbs,</HI> yet he retained the Faculties of his Inward and Outward <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> clear all along; and notwith&s;tanding, at times, his Pains were Great; his Exemplary <HI>Patience,</HI> and Compo&s;ed Re&s;ignation, was remarkably apparent to tho&s;e that Vi&s;ited and Attended him; &s;o that their Sorrow in parting with &s;o dear a Friend, was intermixed with Comfort in be|holding

the Heavenly Frame of Mind wherewith he was Adorned.</P>

<P>We have this farther to add, namely, That our E&s;teem of him was great, becau&s;e of that real worth that was in him, through the Operation of the mighty Power of the Lord that &s;eparated him from the <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>World:</HI> So that he cho&s;e (with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) rather to <HI>&s;uffer Affliction with the People of God, than to en|joy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on,</HI> and it plea&s;ed the Lord to fit him with Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el, &s;o that he was made able to give Judgment in difficult Ca&s;es, where|in many of us have particularly received Benefit, and therefore have cau&s;e to lament the lo&s;s we have by his Removal.

<P>The Place of my Birth was a little Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Town, called <HI>Crowell,</HI> &s;ituate in the upper &s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> Three Miles Ea&s;t-ward fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Thame</HI> the neare&s;t Market-Town.</P>
<P>My Father's Name was <HI>Walter Ellwood;</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> my Mothers Maiden-Name was <HI>Elizabeth P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+man:</HI> both well de&s;cended; but of declinin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Families.

the Parliament-Side, though he took not Arms) not holding him&s;elf &s;afe at his Country Habitation (which lay too near &s;ome Gari&s;ons of the King's) betook him&s;elf to <HI>London,</HI> that City then holding for the Parliament.</P>
<P>There was I bred up (though not without much Difficulty, the City Air not agreeing with my tender Con&s;titution) and there con|tinued, until <HI>Oxford</HI> was &s;urrendred, and the War, in Appearance, ended.</P>
<P>In this time, my Parents contracted an Ac|quaintance, and intimate Friend&s;hip with the Lady <HI>Springett;</HI> who being then the Widow of Sir <HI>William Springett</HI> (who died in the Par|liament Service) was afterwards the Wife of <HI>I&s;aac Penington,</HI> Elde&s;t Son of Alderman <HI>Pe|nington</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> And this Friend&s;hip de|volving from the Parents to the Children, I be|came an early and Particular Play-fellow to her Daughter <HI>Gulielma;</HI> being admitted, as &s;uch, to ride with her in her little Coach, drawn by her Footman about <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</HI></P>
<P>I mention this in this Place, becau&s;e the Con|tinuation of that Acquaintance and Friend&s;hip having been an Occa&s;ional Means of my being afterwards brought to the Knowledge of the Ble&s;&s;ed TRUTH, I &s;hall have frequent Cau&s;e, in the Cour&s;e of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, to make honourable Mention of that Family, to which I am under &s;o many and great Obli|gations.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1646" UNIT="date"> Soon after the Surrender of <HI>Oxford,</HI> my Fa|ther returned to his E&s;tate at <HI>Crowell;</HI> which
<PB N="36" REF="34">
by that time he might have need enough to look after, having &s;pent (I &s;uppo&s;e) the great+e&s;t Part of the Monies which had been left him by his Grandfather, in maintaining him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and his Family at an high Rate in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>My elder Brother (for I had one Brothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and two Si&s;ters, all elder than my &s;elf) was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> while we lived in <HI>London,</HI> Boarded at a privat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> School, in the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Francis Atkin&s;on,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Place called <HI>Hadley,</HI> near <HI>Barnet</HI> in <HI>Hertford+&s;hire;</HI> where he had made &s;ome good Profici+ency in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Tongues.

<P>Thither al&s;o was I &s;ent, as &s;oon as my ten+der Age would permit: for I was indeed bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> young when I went, and yet &s;eemed younge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> than I was, by rea&s;on of my low and little Sta+ture.

<P>At this School (which at that time was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> good Reputation) I profited apace; havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> then a natural Propen&s;ity to Learning: &s;o tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the fir&s;t reading over of my Le&s;&s;on, I com+monly made my &s;elf Ma&s;ter of it: And y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> (which is &s;trange to think of) few Boys in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

For tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> was never (that I remember) whip't upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Score of not having my Le&s;&s;on ready, or of not &s;aying it well: yet being a little bu&s;ie Boy, full o&s; Spirit, of a working Head, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ctive Hand, I could not ea&s;ily conform my &s;elf to the grave and &s;ober Rules, and (as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hen thought) &s;evere Orders of the School; but was often playing one waggi&s;h Prank or other among my Fellow-Scholars, which &s;ubjected me to Correction, &s;o that I have come under the Di&s;cipline of the Rod twice in a Forenoon. Which yet brake no Bones.</P>
<P>Had I been continued at this School, and in due time preferred to an higher; I might in likelihood have been a Scholar: for I was ob|&s;erved to have a Genius apt to learn. But my Father having, &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Republican-Go|vernment</HI> began to &s;ettle, accepted the Office of a Ju&s;tice of the Peace (which was no way Be|neficial, but meerly Honorary, and every way Expen&s;ive) and put him&s;elf into a Port, and Cour&s;e of Living agreeable thereunto; and having al&s;o removed my Brother from <HI>Thame</HI>-School to <HI>Merton</HI>-Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and entred him there in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t chargeable Condition, of a <HI>Fellow-Commoner:</HI> he found it needful to retrench his Expences el&s;ewhere; the Hurt of which fell upon me. For he thereup|on took me from School, to &s;ave the Charge of Maintaining me there: which was &s;omewhat like plucking green Fruit from the Tree, and laying it by, before it was come to its due Ripe|ne&s;s;
<PB N="38" REF="36">
which will thenceforth &s;hrink and wi+ther, and lo&s;e that little Juice and Reli&s;h which it began to have.</P>
<P>Even &s;o it fared with me. For being taken home when I was but young, and before I was well &s;ettled in my Studies, (though I had made a good Progre&s;s in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and was entred in the <HI>Greek</HI>) being left too much to my &s;elf, to ply, or play with my Books, or without them, as I plea&s;ed: I &s;oon &s;hook Hands with my Books by &s;haking my Books out of my Hands, and laying them, by degrees, quite a|&s;ide; and addicted my &s;elf to &s;uch youthfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sports and Plea&s;ures as the Place afforded, and my Condition could reach unto.</P>
<P>By this Means, in a little time, I began to lo&s;e that little Learning I had acquired at School; and by a continued di&s;u&s;e of my Books, became at length &s;o utterly a Stranger to Learn|ing, that I could not have read, far le&s;s have under&s;tood a Sentence in <HI>Latin.</HI> Which I was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that I warily avoided reading to others, even in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book, le&s;t, if I &s;hould meet with a <HI>Latin</HI> Word, I &s;hould &s;hame my &s;elf, by mi&s;pronouncing it.</P>
<P>Thus I went on, taking my Swing in &s;uch vain Cour&s;es, as were accounted harmle&s;s Recre|ations; entertaining my Companions, and fami|liar Acquaintance, with plea&s;ant Di&s;cour&s;es in our Conver&s;ations, by the meer Force of Mo|ther-Wit and Natural Parts, without the Help of School-Cultivation: and was accounted good Company too.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="37">
But I always &s;orted my &s;elf with Per&s;ons of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ngenuity, Temperance and Sobriety: for I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">athed Scurrilities in Conver&s;ation, and had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">atural Aver&s;ion to Immoderate Drinking.

<P>I found it was not &s;o with my Father and Si&s;ter: for as I rode after the Coach, I could hear them talk plea&s;antly one to the other, but they could not di&s;cern how it was with me, becau&s;e I, riding on Horsback, kept much out of Sight.</P>
<P>By that time we got home it was Night.

After the Sermon, I went with him to his Hou&s;e, and in a Freedom of Di&s;cour&s;e (which, from a cer|tain Intimacy that was between us, I common|ly u&s;ed with him) told him where I had been, what Company I had met with there, and what Ob&s;ervations I had made to my &s;elf thereupon.

<P>I had a De&s;ire to go to another Meeting of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and bid my Father's Man enquire, if there was any in the Country thereabouts. He thereupon told me, he had heard at <HI>I&s;aac</HI>

<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"> <HI>Penington</HI>'s, that there was to be a Meeting at <HI>High-Wiccomb</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> next.</P>
<P>Thither therefore I went, though it was Seven Miles from me. And that I might be rather thought to go out a Cour&s;ing, than to a Meeting; I let my Gray-Hound run by my Hor&s;e-&s;ide.</P>
<P>When I came there, and had &s;et up my Hor&s;e at an Inn; I was at a Lo&s;s how to find the Hou&s;e where the Meeting was to be. I knew it not: and was a&s;hamed to ask after it. Wherefore having order'd the Hor&s;tler to take Care of my Dog, I went into the Street, and &s;tood at the Inn-Gate; mu&s;ing with my &s;elf what Cour&s;e to take. But I had not &s;tood long, e're I &s;aw an Hor&s;e-man riding along the Street; whom I remember'd I had &s;een before at <HI>I&s;aac Penington</HI>'s: and he put up his Hor&s;e at the &s;ame Inn.

<P>As &s;oon as ever the Meeting was ended, and the People began to ri&s;e, I, being next the Door, &s;tep't out quickly; and ha&s;tning to my Inn, took Hor&s;e immediately homewards: and (&s;o far as I remember) my having been gone was not taken Notice of by my Father.</P>
<P>This latter Meeting was like the Clinching of a Nail; confirming, and fa&s;tening in my Mind, tho&s;e good Principles, which had &s;unk into me at the former.

And now I &s;aw, that although I had been, in a great degree, pre&s;erved from the common Immoralities, and gro&s;s Pollutions of the World; yet the Spirit of the World had hitherto ruled in me, and led me into Pride, Flattery, Vanity and Super|fluity;
<PB N="54" REF="54">

<P>Now was all my former Life ripped up, and my Sins, by Degrees, were &s;et in order before me.

<P>Now al&s;o did I receive a New Law, (an <HI>In|ward Law</HI> &s;uperadded to the <HI>Outward</HI>) <HI>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> which wrought in me again&s;t all Evil, not only <HI>in Deed,</HI> and <HI>in Word,</HI> but even <HI>in Thought</HI> al&s;o: &s;o that every thing was brought to Judgment, and Judgment pa&s;&s;ed upon all.

<P>Thus the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to deal with me, in &s;omewhat like manner as he had dealt with his People <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of Old (when they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his Righteous LAW) whom, by his Prophet, he called back, re|quired <HI>to put away the Evil of their Doings:</HI>

<P>But the Lord looked on me with a tender Eye; and &s;eeing my Heart was right to him, and that what I had done was meerly through Weakne&s;s, and Fear of Falling, and that I was &s;en&s;ible of my Failing therein, and &s;orry for it: he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to pa&s;s it by, and &s;peak Peace to me again. So that, before I got home, as when I went in the Morning, my Heart was full of Breathing Prayer to the Lord, that he would vouch&s;afe to be with me, and up|hold and carry me through that Days Exerci&s;e: So now at my Return in the Evening, my Heart was full of thankful Acknowledgments, and Prai&s;es unto Him, for his great Goodne&s;s and Favour to me, in having thus far pre&s;erved, and kept me from falling into any thing that might have brought Di&s;honour to his Holy Name, which I had now taken on me.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding that it was thus with me, and that I found Peace and Acceptance with the Lord in &s;ome good degree, according to my Obedience to the Convictions I had re|ceived, by his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> in me: yet was not the Vail &s;o done away, or fully rent, but that there &s;till remained a Cloud upon my Under|&s;tanding, with re&s;pect to my Carriage towards my Father.

So that when I came home, I went to my Father bare headed, as I u&s;ed to do; and gave him a particular Account of the Bu&s;ine&s;s he had given me in Command, in &s;uch manner, that he, ob&s;erving no altera|tion in my Carriage towards him, found no Cau&s;e to take Offence at me.</P>
<P>I had felt for &s;ometime before, an earne&s;t De&s;ire of Mind to go again to <HI>I&s;aac Penington</HI>'s. And I began to que&s;tion whether, when my Father &s;hould come (as I concluded e're long he would) to under&s;tand I enclined to &s;ettle a|mong the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> he would per|mit me the Command of his Hor&s;es, as before. Wherefore, in the Morning when I went to <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> I gave Direction to a Servant of his, to go that Day to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance (who I knew had a Riding Nag to put off, either by Sale, or to be kept for his Work;) and de&s;ire him, in my Name, to &s;end him to me; which he did, and I found him in the Stable, when I came home.</P>
<P>On this Nag I de&s;igned to ride next Day to <HI>I&s;aac Penington</HI>'s: and in order thereunto, aro&s;e betimes and got my &s;elf ready for the Journey. But becau&s;e I would pay all due Re&s;pects to my Father, and not go without his Con&s;ent, or Knowledge at the lea&s;t, I &s;ent one up to him
<PB N="68" REF="68">

He &s;ent me Word, He <HI>would &s;peak with me before I went; and would have me come up to him:</HI> which I did; and &s;tood by his Bed-Side.</P>
<P>Then in a mild and gentle Tone, he &s;aid, <HI>I under&s;tand you have a Mind to go to Mr.</HI> Pening|ton<HI>'s.</HI> I an&s;wered, I have &s;o. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I wonder why you &s;hould. You were there, you know, but a few Days ago; and unle&s;s you had Bu&s;ine&s;s with them, don't you think it will look odly?</HI> I &s;aid, I I thought not. <HI>I doubt,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>You'll tire them with your Company, and make them think they &s;hall be troubled with you.</HI> If, replyed I, I find any thing of that, I'll make the &s;horter Stay. <HI>But,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>can you propo&s;e any &s;ort of Bu&s;ine&s;s with them, more than a meer Vi&s;it?</HI> Yes, &s;aid I, I pro|po&s;e to my &s;elf not only to &s;ee them; but to have &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with them. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;aid he (in a Tone a little Har&s;her) <HI>I hope you don't en|cline to be of their Way.</HI> Truly, an&s;wered I, I like them, and their Way, very well; &s;o far as I yet under&s;tand it: and I am willing to Go to them, that I may under&s;tand it better.</P>
<P>Thereupon he began to reckon up a Bead-Roll of Faults again&s;t the <HI>Quakers;</HI> Telling me <HI>They were a rude unmannerly People, that would not give Civil Re&s;pect or Honour to their Superiors; no not to Magi&s;trates: That they held many dan|gerous Principles: That they were an immode&s;t, &s;hamele&s;s People; and that one of them &s;trip't him|&s;elf</HI>

<P>To all the other Charges, I an&s;wered only, That perhaps they might be either mi&s;report|ed, or mi&s;under&s;tood, as the be&s;t of People had &s;ometimes been. But to the la&s;t Charge, of <HI>Going Naked,</HI> a particular An&s;wer, by way of In&s;tance, was ju&s;t then brought into my Mind, and put into my Mouth, which I had not thought of before: and that was the Example of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> who went <HI>Naked,</HI> among the People, for a long time, (<HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 20. 4.) <HI>Aye,</HI> &s;aid my Fa|ther, <HI>but you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that He was a Prophet of the Lord, and had an expre&s;s Command from God to Go &s;o.</HI> Yes, Sir, replied I, I do con&s;i|der that: but I con&s;ider al&s;o, that the <HI>Jews</HI> a|mong whom he lived, did not own him for a Prophet, nor believe that he had &s;uch a Com|mand from God. And, added I, how know we but that this <HI>Quaker</HI> may be a Prophet too, and might be commanded to do as he did, for &s;ome Rea&s;on which we under&s;tand not.</P>

And as I &s;pake tho&s;e Words, I withdrew gently to the Chamber-Door; and then ha&s;tning down Stairs, went immediately

<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e with my Father had ca&s;t me &s;omewhat back in my Journey, and it being Fifteen long Miles thither, the Ways bad, and my Nag but &s;mall: it was in the Afternoon that I got thither.

<P>I knew not what he meant by this: but I cryed in Spirit to the Lord, that He would be plea&s;ed to be a Mouth and Wi&s;dom to me, and keep me from being Entangled in any Snare.</P>
<P>He asked me many Que&s;tions, concerning my Birth, my Education, my Acquaintance in <HI>Oxford&s;hire;</HI> particularly what Men of Note I knew there.

<P>This Fellow, hearing the Notice which was given, for the <HI>Bridewell</HI>-Men to go down, in order to be removed to <HI>Bridewell</HI> again; and hoping (no Doubt) that fre&s;h Quarters would produce fre&s;h Commons, and that he &s;hould fare better with us, than where he was: thru&s;t him&s;elf among&s;t us; and went down into the Pre&s;s Yard with us.

<P>Wherefore, as &s;oon as the Sheriff had done &s;peaking to us, and we had made our Acknow|ledgment of his Kindne&s;s; I &s;tept a little nearer to him, and pointing to that Fellow, &s;aid, That Man is not only none of our Company, for he is no <HI>Quaker:</HI> but is an idle di&s;&s;olute Fellow, who hath thru&s;t him&s;elf in among our Friends, to be &s;ent to Pri&s;on with them, that he might
<PB N="187" REF="193">
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"> live upon them: therefore I de&s;ire we may not be troubled with him at <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>At this the Sheriff &s;miled; and calling the Fellow forth, &s;aid to him, <HI>How came you to be in Pri&s;on?</HI> I was taken at a Meeting, &s;aid he, <HI>But what Bu&s;ine&s;s had you there?</HI> &s;aid the Sheriff. I went to hear, &s;aid he. <HI>Aye, you went upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r&s;e De&s;ign, it &s;eems,</HI> replied the Sheriff; <HI>but I'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> di&s;appoint you,</HI> &s;aid he: <HI>for I'll change your Company; and &s;end you to them that are like your &s;elf.</HI> Then calling for the <HI>Turnkey,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>Take this Fellow, and put him among the Felons; and be &s;ure let him not trouble the Quakers any more.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto this Fellow had &s;tood with his Hat on, as willing to have pa&s;&s;ed (if he could) for a <HI>Quaker;</HI> but as &s;oon as he heard this Doom pa&s;&s;ed on him, off went his Hat: and to bow|ing and &s;craping he fell, with <HI>Good your Wor&s;hip have pity upon me, and &s;et me at Liberty. No, no,</HI> &s;aid the Sheriff, <HI>I will not &s;o far di&s;appoint you: &s;ince you had a Mind to be in Pri&s;on, in Pri&s;on you &s;hall be for me.</HI> Then bidding, the Turnkey take him away; he had him up, and put him among the Felons: and &s;o Friends had a good Deliver|ance from him.</P>
<P>The Sheriff then bidding us Farewel, the Porter of <HI>Bridewell</HI> came to us, and told us, <HI>We know our Way to</HI> Bridewell <HI>without him; and he could tru&s;t us: therefore he would not &s;tay nor go with us; but left us to take our own time; &s;o we were in before Bed-time.</HI></P>
<P>Then went we up again to our Friends in <HI>Newgate;</HI> and gave them an Account of what
<PB N="188" REF="194">
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"> had pa&s;&s;ed: and having taken a &s;olemn Leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them; we made up our Packs to be gone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> But before I pa&s;s from <HI>Newgate,</HI> I think it no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> ami&s;s, to give the Reader &s;ome little Accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of what I Ob&s;erved while I was there.</P>
<P>The common Side of <HI>Newgate</HI> is generally accounted, as it really is, the Wor&s;t part of that Pri&s;on; not &s;o much from the Place, as the People: it being u&s;ually &s;tocked with the veri|e&s;t Rogues, and meane&s;t &s;ort of Felons, and Pick-Pockets; who not being able to pay Cham|ber-Rent on the Ma&s;ter's Side, are thru&s;t in there. And if they come in Bad, to be &s;ure they do not go out better: for here they have an Opportunity to in&s;truct one another in their Art; and impart each to other what Improve|ments they have made therein.</P>
<P>The Common Hall (which is the fir&s;t Room over the Gate) is a good Place to walk in, when the Pri&s;oners are out of it (&s;aving the danger of catching &s;ome Cattle, which they may have left in it:) and there I u&s;ed to walk in a Morning, before they were let up; and &s;ometimes in the Day time, when they have been there.</P>
<P>They all carried them&s;elves re&s;pectfully to|wards me; which I imputed chiefly to this, That when any of our Women-Friends came there to Vi&s;it the Pri&s;oners, if they had not Re|lations of their own there, to take care of them: I, (as being a young Man, and more at lei&s;ure than mo&s;t others, for I could not play the <HI>Taylor</HI> there) was forward to go down with them to
<PB N="189" REF="195">
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"> the Grate, and &s;ee them &s;afe out. And &s;ome|times they have left Money in my Hands for the Felons (who at &s;uch times were very im|portunate Beggars:) which I forthwith di&s;tri|buted among them in Bread; which was to be had in the Place. But &s;o trouble&s;ome an Office it was, that I thought one had as good have had a Pack of hungry Hounds about one, as the&s;e when they knew there was a Dole to be given. Yet this, I think, made them a little the more ob&s;ervant to me; for they would di&s;|po&s;e them&s;elves to one &s;ide of the Room, that they might make way for me to walk on the o|ther. And when I walked there, I had u&s;ually a Book in my Hand; on which I had mine Eye: which made them think I did not heed what they &s;aid. By this Means, mine Ear be|ing attentive to them, I heard them relate one to another many of their Rogui&s;h Pranks.</P>
<P>One Day, as I was thus walking to and fro be&s;ide them, I heard them recounting one to another what feats they had done at <HI>Pocket-picking</HI> and <HI>Shop-lifting.</HI> Whereupon, turning &s;hort upon them, I asked them, Which of you all will undertake to pick my Pocket? They were not very forward to An&s;wer; but viewed me round. I wore a long Gown, which was lap't over before, and tied about the Middle; and had no Pocket-Holes in it. When they had a while con&s;idered it, and I (having taken another Turn) was come up again to them, One of them &s;aid, <HI>Why, Ma&s;ter, If you will Pro|mi&s;e not to Pro&s;ecute us, we will &s;how you a Piece</HI>

<P>I have &s;ometimes occa&s;ionally been in the Hall in an Evening; and have &s;een the Whores let in unto them (which I take to be a common Practice:) Na&s;ty Sluts indeed they were; and in that re&s;pect the more &s;uitable.

<P>Under this ea&s;ie Re&s;traint we lay, till the Court &s;ate at the <HI>Old-Baily</HI> again: And then, whether it was that the Heat of the Storm was &s;omewhat abated, or by what other means Pro|vidence wrought it, I know not; we were called to the Bar, and without further Que&s;tion, di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Whereupon we returned to <HI>Bridewell</HI> again, and having rai&s;ed &s;ome Monies among us, and therewith gratified both the Ma&s;ter and his Por|ter, for their Kindne&s;s to us; we &s;pent &s;ome|time in a &s;olemn Meeting, to return our thank|ful Acknowledgement to the LORD, both for His Pre&s;ervation of us in Pri&s;on, and Deliver|ance of us out of it: and then taking a &s;olemn Farewel of each other, we departed with Bag and Baggage. And I took care to return my Hammack to the Owner; with due Acknow|ledgement of his great Kindne&s;s, in lending it me.</P>
<P>Being now at Liberty, I vi&s;ited more gene|rally my Friends that were &s;till in Pri&s;on; and more particularly my Friend and Benefactor, <HI>William Penington,</HI> at his Hou&s;e: and then went to wait upon my Ma&s;ter <HI>Milton.</HI> With whom
<PB N="217" REF="223">
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"> yet I could not propo&s;e to enter upon my inter|mitted Studies, until I had been in <HI>Buckingham|&s;hire,</HI> to vi&s;it my worthy Friends <HI>I&s;aac Penington,</HI> and his Virtuous Wife; with other Friends in that Country.</P>
<P>Thither therefore I betook my &s;elf, and the Weather being Fro&s;ty, and the Ways, by that means, clean and good; I walked it thorow in a Day: and was received by my Friends there, with &s;uch Demon&s;tration of hearty Kindne&s;s, as made my Journey very ea&s;ie to me.</P>
<P>I had &s;pent in my Impri&s;onment that Twen|ty Shillings, which I had received of <HI>William Penington;</HI> and Twenty of the Fourty, which had been &s;ent me from <HI>Mary Penington,</HI> and had the Remainder then about me. That therefore I now returned to her, with due Acknowledge|ment of her Husband's and her great Care of me, and Liberality to me, in the time of my Need. She would have had me kept it. But I beg'd her to accept it from me again; &s;ince it was the Redundancy of their Kindne&s;s, and the other Part had an&s;wered the Occa&s;ion, for which it was &s;ent: and my Importunity pre|vailed.</P>
<P>I intended only a Vi&s;it hither, not a Conti|nuance: and therefore purpo&s;ed, after I had &s;taid a few Days, to return to my Lodging, and former Cour&s;e in <HI>London:</HI> but Providence ordered it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aac Penington</HI> had at that time two Sons and one Daughter (all then very young) of whom the Elde&s;t Son <HI>(John Penington)</HI> and the
<PB N="218" REF="224">
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"> Daughter <HI>(Mary,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Daniel Wharley)</HI> are yet living at the writing of this. And being him&s;elf both Skilful and Curious in <HI>Pronouncia|tion;</HI> he was very de&s;irous to have them well grounded in the <HI>Rudiments of the Engli&s;h Tongue:</HI> to which End he had &s;ent for a Man out of <HI>Lan|ca&s;hire</HI> (whom, upon enquiry, he had heard of) who was undoubtedly the mo&s;t accurate <HI>Eng|li&s;h Teacher,</HI> that ever I met with, or have heard of. His Name was <HI>Richard Bradley.</HI> But as he pretended no higher than the <HI>Engli&s;h Tongue;</HI> and had led them, by <HI>Grammar Rules,</HI> to the highe&s;t Improvement they were capable of in that: he had then taken his Leave of them, and was gone up to <HI>London,</HI> to Teach an <HI>Engli&s;h School</HI> of <HI>Friends</HI> Children there.</P>
<P>This put my Friend to a fre&s;h Straight. He had &s;ought for a New Teacher, to in&s;truct his Children in the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> as the Old had done in the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> but had not yet found one. Wherefore one Evening as we &s;ate together by the Fire in his Bed-Chamber (which, for want of Health, he kept) He asked me (his Wife being by) <HI>If I would be &s;o kind to him, as to &s;tay a while with him, till he could hear of &s;uch a Man as he aimed at; and in the mean time enter his Chil|dren in the Rudiments of the</HI> Latin Tongue.</P>
<P>This Que&s;tion was not more unexpected, than &s;urprizing to me; and the more, becau&s;e it &s;eemed directly to thwart my former Pur|po&s;e, and Undertaking, of endeavouring to improve my &s;elf by following my Studies with my Ma&s;ter <HI>Milton:</HI> which this would give at

<P>But the Sen&s;e I had of the manifold Obliga|tions I lay under to the&s;e worthy Friends of mine, &s;hut out all Rea&s;onings; and di&s;po&s;ed my Mind to an ab&s;olute Re&s;ignation to their De&s;ire; that I might te&s;tifie my Gratitude, by a Willingne&s;s to do them any friendly Service, that I could be capable of.</P>
<P>And though I que&s;tioned my Ability to carry on that Work, to its due Height and Propor|tion; yet as that was not propo&s;ed, but an Initiation only, by <HI>Accidence</HI> into <HI>Grammar:</HI> I con&s;ented to the Propo&s;al, as a pre&s;ent Ex|pedient (till a more qualified Per&s;on &s;hould be found;) without further Treaty, or mention of Terms between us, than that of mutual Friend&s;hip. And to render this Digre&s;&s;ion from my own Studies the le&s;s unea&s;ie to my Mind, I recollected (and often thought of) that Rule in <HI>Lilly,</HI><Q><L><HI>Qui docet indoctos, licet indocti&s;&s;imus e&s;&s;et,</HI></L>

<P>Not only <HI>George,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Parker</HI> (who was with him) but divers of the Ancient Friends of that Country, endeavoured to quiet that trouble&s;om Man, and make him &s;en&s;ible of his Error: but his unruly Spirit would &s;till be Oppo&s;ing what was &s;aid unto him, and ju|&s;tifying him&s;elf in that Practice. This brought a great Weight and Exerci&s;e upon me (who &s;ate at a Di&s;tance in the outward Part of the Meeting:) and after I had for &s;ome time bore the Burthen thereof, I &s;tood up in the con&s;train|ing Power of the LORD, and in great Ten|derne&s;s of Spirit, declared unto the Meeting, and to that Per&s;on more particularly, how it had been with me in that re&s;pect; how I had been betrayed into that wrong Practice, how &s;trong I had been therein, and how the Lord had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;hew me the Evil thereof, and recover me out of it.</P>
<P>This coming unexpectedly from me, a young Man, a Stranger, and one who had not inter|medled with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Meeting, had that Effect upon the Caviller, that if it did not &s;atisfie him, it did at lea&s;t &s;ilence him, and made him for the Pre&s;ent &s;ink down and be &s;till, without giving any further Di&s;turbance to the Meeting.

<P><MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"> By the time we came back from this Journey, the Summer was pretty far gone, and the fol|lowing Winter I &s;pent with the Children of the Family as before, without any remarkable Alteration in my Circum&s;tances, until the next Spring: when I found in my &s;elf a Di&s;po|&s;ition of Mind, to change my Single Life for a Married State.</P>
<P>I had always entertained &s;o high a Regard for Marriage, as it was a Divine In&s;titution, that I held it not lawful to make it a &s;ort of political Trade to ri&s;e in the World by. And therefore as I could not but, in my Judgment, blame &s;uch, as I found made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to Hunt after, and endeavour to gain tho&s;e who were accounted great <HI>Fortunes;</HI> not &s;o much re|garding <HI>What &s;he is,</HI> as <HI>what &s;he has,</HI> but mak|ing Wealth the chief, if not the only thing they Aimed at: &s;o I re&s;olved to avoid, in my own Practice, that Cour&s;e; and how much &s;o|ever my Condition might have prompted me (as well as others) to &s;eek Advantage that way, never to engage on the Account of <HI>Riches,</HI> nor at all to Marry, till judicious Affection drew me to it, which I now began to feel at Work in my Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Object of this Affection was a Friend (who&s;e Name was <HI>Mary Ellis</HI>) whom for divers Years I had had an Acquaintance with, in the
<PB N="260" REF="268">
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"> way of common Friend&s;hip only; and in whom I thought I then &s;aw tho&s;e fair Prints of Truth and &s;olid Virtue, which I afterwards found in a &s;ublime Degree, in her: but what her Con|dition in the World was, as to E&s;tate, I was wholly a Stranger to, nor de&s;ired to know.</P>
<P>I had once, a Year or two before, had an Opportunity to do her a &s;mall Piece of Service, which &s;he wanted &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance in: wherein I acted with all Sincerity, and Freedom of Mind, not expecting, or de&s;iring any Advan|tage by her, or Reward from her; being very well &s;atisfied in the Act it &s;elf, that I had &s;erved a Friend, and helped the Helple&s;s.</P>
<P>That little Intercour&s;e of common Kindne&s;s between us Ended, without the lea&s;t Though (I am verily per&s;waded, on her Part; well-a&s;+&s;ured on my own) of any other or further Re+lation, than that of free and fair Friend&s;hip Nor did it, at that time, lead us into any clo&s;e Conver&s;ation, or more intimate Acquaintan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> one with the other, than had been before.</P>
<P>But &s;ome time (and that a good while) a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+ter, I found my Heart &s;ecretly drawn, and in+clining towards her: Yet was I not ha&s;ty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> propo&s;ing; but waited to feel a &s;atisfactory Set+tlement of Mind therein, before I made an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tep thereto.</P>

<P>I u&s;ed not many Words to her: but I felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Divine Power went along with the Words,

<P>I made, at that time, but a &s;hort Vi&s;it. For having told her, I did not expect an An&s;wer from her now; but de&s;ired &s;he would, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, weigh the Propo&s;al made, and in due time give me &s;uch an An&s;wer there|unto, as the Lord &s;hould give her: I took my leave of her, and departed; leaving the I&s;&s;ue to the Lord.</P>
<P>I had a Journey then at hand, which I fore|&s;aw would take me up about two Weeks time. Wherefore, the Day before I was to &s;et out, I went to vi&s;it her again; to acquaint her with my Journey, and excu&s;e my Ab&s;ence: not yet pre&s;&s;ing her for an An&s;wer; but a&s;&s;uring her, that I felt in my &s;elf an Increa&s;e of Affection to her, and hoped to receive a &s;uitable Re|turn from her in the Lord's time; to whom, in the mean time, I committed both her, my &s;elf and the Concern between us. And indeed, I found at my Return, that I could not have left it in a better Hand: for the Lord had been my Advocate in my Ab&s;ence, and had &s;o far an&s;wered all her Objections, that, when I came to her again, &s;he rather acquainted me with them, than urged them.</P>
<P>From that time forwards we Entertained each other with Affectionate Kindne&s;s in order to Marriage; which yet we did not ha&s;ten to, but went on deliberately. Neither did I u&s;e tho&s;e vulgar ways of Court&s;hip, by making

<P>While this Affair &s;tood thus with me, I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cca&s;ion to take another Journey into <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;&s;ex:</HI> Which yet I would not mention here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ut for a particular Accident, which befel me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Way.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion of this Journey was this. <HI>Mary Penington</HI>'s Daughter <HI>Guli</HI> intending to go to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er Uncle <HI>Springett</HI>'s in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and from thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mong&s;t her Tenants; her Mother de&s;ired me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o accompany her, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her Bu&s;i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s with her <HI>Tenants.</HI></P>
<P>We tarried at <HI>London</HI> the fir&s;t Night, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">et out next Morning on the <HI>Tunbridge</HI>-Road; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd <HI>Seven-Oak</HI> lying in our way, we put in here to Bait: But truly, we had much ado to get either Provi&s;ions or Room for our &s;elves, or our Hor&s;es; the Hou&s;e was &s;o filled with Gue&s;ts, and tho&s;e not of the better Sort. For the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being (as we were told) on the Road that Day for the <HI>Wells,</HI> divers of his <HI>Guards,</HI> and the meaner &s;ort of his <HI>Retinue,</HI> had near filled all the <HI>Inns</HI> there.</P>
<P>I left <HI>John Gigger</HI> (who waited on <HI>Guli</HI> in this Journey, and was afterwards her menial Servant) to take Care for the Hor&s;es, while I did the like, as well as I could for her. I got a little Room to put her into, and having &s;hut her into it, went to &s;ee what Relief the <HI>Kitchin</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="272">
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"> would afford us: and with much ado, by Praying hard, and Paying dear, I got a &s;mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Joint of Meat from the Spit; which &s;erved ra+ther to &s;tay, than &s;atisfie our Stomachs; for w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> were all pretty &s;harp &s;et.</P>
<P>After this &s;hort Repa&s;t, being weary of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Quarters, we quickly Mounted, and took th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Road again; willing to ha&s;ten from a Place, where we found nothing but Rudene&s;s: fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Roy&s;ters,</HI> who at that time &s;warmed there, be&s;ides the Damning Oaths they belched out a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> one another, looked very &s;owerly on us, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> they grudged us both the Hor&s;es we rode, and the Cloaths we wore.</P>
<P>A Knot of the&s;e &s;oon followed us, de&s;igning (as we afterwards found) to put an Abu&s;e up|on us, and make them&s;elves Sport with us. We had a &s;pot of fine, &s;mooth, &s;andy Way, whereon the Hor&s;es trod &s;o &s;oftly that we heard them not, till one of them was upon us. I was then riding a Brea&s;t with <HI>Guli,</HI> and di&s;|cour&s;ing with her; when on a &s;uddain hearing a little Noi&s;e, and turning mine Eye that way, I &s;aw an Hor&s;eman coming up on the further Side of her Hor&s;e, having his left Arm &s;tretch|ed out, ju&s;t ready to take her about the Wa&s;te, and pluck her off backwards from her own Hor&s;e, to lay her before him upon his. I had but ju&s;t time to thru&s;t forth my Stick, between him and her, and bid him &s;tand off: and at the &s;ame time reigning my Hor&s;e, to let hers go before me, thru&s;t in between her and him and being better Mounted than he, my Hor&s;e
<PB N="265" REF="273">
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"> run him off. But his Hor&s;e being (tho' weak|er than mine, yet) Nimble, he &s;lipt by me, and got up to her on the near Side; endeavour|ing to offer Abu&s;e to her: To prevent which, I thru&s;t in upon him again, and in our Jo&s;tling, we drove her Hor&s;e quite out of the Way, and almo&s;t into the next Hedge.</P>
<P>While we were thus Contending, I heard a Noi&s;e of loud Laughter behind us; and turn|ing my Head that way, I &s;aw three or four Hor&s;e-men more, who could &s;carce &s;it their Hor&s;es for Laughing, to &s;ee the Sport their Companion made with us. From thence I &s;aw it was a Plot laid; and that this rude Fel|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ow was not to be dallied with: Wherefore I be&s;tirr'd my &s;elf the more to keep him off; Admoni&s;hing him to take Warning in time, and give over his Abu&s;ivene&s;s, le&s;t he Re|pented too late. He had in his Hand a &s;hort thick Truncheon, which he held up at me; on which laying hold with a &s;trong Gripe, I &s;uddainly wrenched it out of his Hand, and threw it at as far a Di&s;tance behind me, as I could.</P>
<P>While he rode back to fetch his Truncheon, I called up hone&s;t <HI>John Gigger;</HI> who was indeed a right hone&s;t Man, and of a Temper &s;o throughly Peaceable, that he had not hitherto put in at all. But now I rouzed him, and bid him ride &s;o clo&s;e up to his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Hor&s;e, on the further Side, that no Hor&s;e might thru&s;t in between; and I would endeavour to Guard the near Side. But he, good Man, not thinking it,

<P>This his Companions (who kept an equal di&s;tance behind us) both heard and &s;aw; and thereupon Two of them advancing, came up to us.

<P>One of their Campany &s;taid yet behind.

<P>A Copy of the foregoing Lines, inclo&s;ed in a Letter of <HI>Condoleance,</HI> I &s;ent by the fir&s;t Po&s;t in|to <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> to my dear Friends the af|flicted Parents: And upon my Return home, going to vi&s;it them, we &s;ate down and &s;olemnly mixed our Sorrows and Tears together.</P>
<P>About this time (as I remember) it was, that &s;ome Bickerings happening between &s;ome <HI>Bap|ti&s;ts,</HI> and &s;ome of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> in or about <HI>High-Wiccomb</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire;</HI> oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome reflecting Words a <HI>Baptist</HI>-Preacher had publickly uttered in one of their Meetings there, again&s;t the <HI>Quakers</HI> in general, and <HI>W.

Penn.</HI></P>
<P>To this Meeting, it being &s;o near me, I went; rather to Countenance the Cau&s;e, than for any Delight I took in &s;uch Work: for indeed, I have rarely found the Advantage, equivolent to the
<PB N="282" REF="290">
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"> Trouble and Danger, ari&s;ing from tho&s;e Conte&s;ts. For which Cau&s;e I would not chu&s;e them, as, be|ing ju&s;tly engaged, I would not refu&s;e them.</P>
<P>The I&s;&s;ue of this proved better than I ex|pected. For <HI>Ives</HI> having undertaken an Ill Cau&s;e, to argue again&s;t the <HI>Divine Light,</HI> and <HI>Univer&s;al Grace, conferr'd by God on all Men;</HI> when he had &s;pent his Stock of Arguments, which he brought with him on that Subject: finding his Work go on heavily, and the Audi|tory not well &s;atisfied; &s;tept down from his Seat, and departed, with purpo&s;e to have bro|ken up the A&s;&s;embly. But, except &s;ome few of his Party, who followed him, the People ge|nerally &s;tay'd, and were the more attentive to what was afterwards delivered among&s;t them. Which <HI>Ives</HI> under&s;tanding came in again, and in an angry railing Manner, expre&s;&s;ing his Di&s;|like that we went not all away when he did, gave more Di&s;gu&s;t to the People.</P>
<P>After the Meeting was ended, I &s;ent to my Friend <HI>I. P.</HI> (by his Son and Servant, who re|turned Home, though it was late, that Even|ing) a &s;hort Account of the Bu&s;ine&s;s in the fol|lowing <HI>Di&s;tich.</HI></P>

<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"> But both they and we had quickly other Work found us: It &s;oon became a &s;tormy time. The Clouds had been long gathering, and threat|ned a Tempe&s;t. The Parliament had &s;ate &s;ome time before, and hatched that unaccountable Law, which was called <HI>The Conventicle Act:</HI> (If that may be allowed to be called a Law, by whom&s;oever made) which was &s;o directly con|trary to the Fundamental Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to common Ju&s;tice, Equity and right Rea&s;on; as this manife&s;tly was.

<P N="2">2. By that Act, the Informers (who Swear for their own Advantage, as being thereby en|tituled to a Third Part of the Fines) were many times concealed, driving on an underhand pri|vate Trade: &s;o that Men might be, and often were Convicted and Fined, without having any Notice or Knowledge of it, till the Officers came and took away their Goods, nor even then could they tell by who&s;e Evidence they were convicted. Than which, what could be more oppo&s;ite to common Ju&s;tice? which requires that every Man &s;hould be openly charged, and have his Accu&s;er Face to Face, that he might

<P N="3">3. By that Act, the Innocent were puni&s;hed for the Offences of the Guilty. If the Wife or Child was convicted of having been at one of tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, which by that Act was adjudg|ed Unlawful; the Fine was levied on the Goods of the Husband or Father of &s;uch Wife or Child: though he was neither pre&s;ent at &s;uch A&s;&s;embly, nor was of the &s;ame Religious Per&s;wa&s;ion that they were of; but perhaps an Enemy to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was left in the arbitrary Plea&s;ure of the Ju&s;tices to lay half the Fine for the Hou&s;e or Ground where &s;uch A&s;&s;embly was holden, and half the Fine for a pretended unknown Preacher; and the whole Fines of &s;uch and &s;o many of the Meeters as they &s;hould account Poor, upon any other or others of the People, who were pre&s;ent at the &s;ame Meeting (not exceeding a certain limitted Sum;) without any regard to Equity or Rea&s;on. And yet (&s;uch Blindne&s;s doth the <HI>Spirit of Per&s;ecution</HI> bring on Men, otherwi&s;e &s;harp &s;ighted enough) that this Unlawful, Un|ju&s;t, Unequal, Unrea&s;onable and Unrighteous Law took place in (almo&s;t) all Places, and was vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted again&s;t the Meetings of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in general; though the Brunt of the Storm fell mo&s;t &s;harply on the People called <HI>Quakers:</HI> not that it &s;eemed to be more particu|larly levelled at them: but that they &s;tood more fair, &s;teady and open, as a But to receive all the

<P>No &s;ooner had the Bi&s;hops obtained this Law, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all other Meetings but their own, but &s;ome of the Clergy of mo&s;t Ranks, and &s;ome others too, who were over-much bigotted to that Party, be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves with might and main, to find out and Encourage the mo&s;t profligate Wretches to turn Informers; and to get &s;uch Per&s;ons into Parochial Offices, as would be mo&s;t ob&s;equious to their Commands, and ready at their Beck, to put it into the mo&s;t ri|gorous Execution. Yet it took not alike in all Places; but &s;ome were forwarder in the Work than others, according as the Agents intended to be chiefly imployed therein, had been pre|di&s;po&s;ed thereunto.</P>
<P>For in &s;ome Parts of the Nation care had been timely taken, by &s;ome not of the lowe&s;t Rank, to chu&s;e out &s;ome particular Per&s;ons (Men of &s;harp Wit, clo&s;e Countenances, pliant Tempers and deep Di&s;&s;imulation) and &s;end them forth a|mong the <HI>Sectaries,</HI> &s;o called; with In&s;tructions to thru&s;t them&s;elves into all Societies, Conform to all, or any &s;ort of Religious Profe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Pro|teous</HI>-like change their Shapes, and transform them&s;elves from one Religious Appearance to another, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require.

The Entertainment he found among&s;t them, de&s;erved a better Return than he made them.

<P>But becau&s;e the Law provided, <HI>That a Con+viction mu&s;t be grounded upon the Oaths of two Witne&s;&s;es;</HI> it was needful for him, in order to the carrying on his intended Mi&s;chief, to find out an A&s;&s;ociate, who might be both &s;ordid e|nough for &s;uch an Imployment, and vicious enough to be his Companion.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"> Book: For a Libel they could not call it, my Name being to it at length.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;ending for <HI>Ayrs,</HI> who had brought the Book, Ju&s;tice <HI>Titchborn</HI> examined him if <HI>he knew me, and where I dwelt.</HI> Who telling him, He <HI>knew me well, and had been often at my Hou&s;e:</HI> He gave him in charge to give me Notice, that <HI>I &s;hould appear before him and the other Ju&s;tice, at</HI> Rickman&s;worth <HI>on &s;uch a Day:</HI> Threatning that <HI>if I did not appear, he him&s;elf &s;hould be Pro&s;ecuted for &s;preading the Book.</HI></P>
<P>This put <HI>William Ayrs</HI> in a Fright. Over he came in ha&s;te with this Me&s;&s;age to me; troubled that he &s;hould be a means to bring me into Trouble. But I endeavoured to give him Ea&s;e, by a&s;&s;uring him I would not fail (with God's Leave) to appear at the time and place appoint|ed; and thereby free him from <HI>Trouble</HI> or <HI>Danger.</HI></P>
<P>In the Interim I received Advice, by an Ex|pre&s;s out of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> that <HI>Guli Penn</HI> (with whom I had had an Intimate Acquaintance, and firm Friend&s;hip from our very Youths) was very dangerou&s;ly Ill (her Husband being then ab&s;ent in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>) and that &s;he had a great De|&s;ire to &s;ee and &s;peak with me.</P>
<P>This put me to a great Straight, and brought a &s;ore Exerci&s;e on my Mind. I was divided betwixt Honour and Friend&s;hip. I had engag|ed my Word to appear before the Ju&s;tices; which to omit, would bring Di&s;honour on me and my Profe&s;&s;ion. To &s;tay till that time was come and pa&s;t, might probably prove (if I

<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"> &s;hould then be left at Liberty) too late to An|&s;wer her de&s;ire, and &s;atisfie Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little Deliberation, I re&s;olv'd (as the be&s;t Expedient to an&s;wer both Ends) to go over next Morning to the Ju&s;tices, and lay my Straight before them; and try if I cou'd procure from them a Re&s;pit of my Appearance before them, until I had been in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and paid the Duty of Friend&s;hip to my Sick Friend. Which I had the more Hopes to obtain, becau&s;e I knew tho&s;e Ju&s;tices had a great re&s;pect for <HI>Guli.</HI> For when <HI>William Penn</HI> and &s;he were fir&s;t Married, they lived for &s;ome Years at <HI>Rickman&s;worth;</HI> in which time they contracted a <HI>Neighbourly Friend|&s;hip</HI> with both the&s;e Ju&s;tices and theirs; who ever after retained a kind regard for them both.</P>
<P>Early therefore in the Morning I rode over. But being wholly a Stranger to the Ju&s;tices, I went fir&s;t to <HI>Watford,</HI> that I might take <HI>Ayrs</HI> a|long with me, who &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf to have &s;ome Intere&s;t in <HI>Ju&s;tice Titchborn:</HI> And when I came there, under&s;tanding that another Friend of that Town, who&s;e Name was <HI>John Wells,</HI> was well acquainted with the other Ju&s;tice, <HI>Fotherly;</HI> having imparted to them the Occa&s;ion of my coming, I took them both with me, and ha&s;ted back to <HI>Rickman&s;worth.</HI> Where having put our Hor&s;es up at an Inn, and leaving <HI>W.

<P>After he had asked me (in a Tone which &s;pake Di&s;plea&s;ure) <HI>what I had to &s;ay to him?</HI> I told him, I came to wait on him, upon an Intima|tion given me, that he had &s;omething to &s;ay to me: He thereupon, plucking my Book out of his Pocket, asked me, <HI>If I owned my &s;elf to be the Author of that Book?</HI> I told him If he plea&s;ed to let me look into it; if it were mine, I would not deny it. He thereupon giving it into my Hand, when I had turned over the Leaves, and look'd it through, finding it to be as it came from the Pre&s;s; I told him, I wrote the Book, and would own it, all but the Errors of the Pre&s;s. Whereupon he, looking &s;ternly on me, an&s;wered, <HI>Your own Errors you &s;hould have &s;aid.</HI></P>
<P>Having Innocency on my &s;ide, I was not at all daunted at either his Speech, or Looks: but feeling the Lord pre&s;ent with me, I replied, I know there are Errors of the Pre&s;s in it, and therefore I excepted them: but I do not know there is any Error of mine in it, and therefore cannot except them. But (added I) if thou plea&s;e&s;t to &s;hew me any Error of mine in it, I &s;hall readily both acknowledge and retract it. And thereupon I de&s;ired him to give me an In|&s;tance, in any one Pa&s;&s;age in that Book, wherein he thought I had Erred. He &s;aid, <HI>he needed not go to particulars: but charge me with the general Contents of the whole Book.</HI> I replied, that &s;uch a Charge would be too General, for me to give a Particular An&s;wer to: but if he would a&s;&s;ign

And therefore I again intreated him, to let me know what particular Pa&s;&s;age, or Pa&s;|&s;ages had given him an Offence. He told me, <HI>I needed not to be in &s;o much haste for that; I might have it timely enough, if not too &s;oon: But this,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is not the Day appointed for your Hearing; and therefore</HI> (added he) <HI>what, I pray, made you in &s;uch ha&s;te to come now?</HI> I told him, I hoped he wou'd not take it for an Argument of Guilt, that I came before I was &s;ent for: and offered my &s;elf to my Purgation, before the time ap|pointed. And this I &s;pake with &s;omewhat a brisker Air: which had &s;o much Influence on him, as to bring a &s;omewhat &s;ofter Air over his Countenance.</P>
<P>Then, going on, I told him, I had a parti|cular Occa&s;ion, which induced me to come now; which was, That I received Advice la&s;t Night, by an Expre&s;s out of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> That <HI>William Penn</HI>'s Wife (with whom I had had an intimate Acquaintance, and &s;trict Friend|&s;hip, <HI>ab ip&s;is fer&egrave; Incunabilis,</HI> at lea&s;t, <HI>&agrave; teneris Unguiculis</HI>) lay now there very ill; not with|out great Danger (in the Apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e about her) of her Life: and that &s;he had ex|pre&s;t her de&s;ire that I would come to her, as &s;oon as I could; the rather, for that her Hu&s;|band

For Friends, it is a trying Day, a Day of great Difficulty and Danger, wherein the Enemy is at work, and very bu&s;ie, &s;etting his Snares on every &s;ide; and &s;preading his Temptations on every hand: And &s;ome, alas! have entred thereinto, and are caught and held therein, for whom my Soul in &s;ecret mourns.</P>
<P>And truly Friends, a great weight hath been upon my Spirit for many Days, and my Mind hath been deeply exerci&s;ed, in the &s;ence I have of the Enemy's prevailing, by one Bait or o|ther, to un&s;ettle the Minds of &s;ome, whom the Arm of the Lord had reached unto, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure gathered to a re&s;ting Place: But not abiding in that pure Light, by which they were at fir&s;t vi&s;ited, and to which they were at fir&s;t turned, the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> hath been vailed a|gain; the <HI>Eye,</HI> which was once in &s;ome mea&s;ure opened, hath the God of the World in&s;en&s;ibly Blinded again, and Darkne&s;s is again come o|ver, to that degree, that they can now content|edly take up again, what in the Day of their Convincement, and in the time of their true Tenderne&s;s, they ca&s;t off as a Burthen too heavy to be born.

<P><MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="date"> But now we come to his great Work, of the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament:</HI> which, at his Lei|&s;ure, he had in Hand for &s;ome Years; and both he and we had this Advantage of his being put by his Work in an&s;wering Adver&s;aries; parti|cularly that of the Snake, and <HI>G.

<PB N="446" REF="456">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="date"> which, having mentioned the Prai&s;e of Hi&s;tory out of <HI>Cicero,</HI> viz. That it is <HI>The Witne&s;s of Times, the Light of Truth, the Life of Memory,</HI> &amp;c. which he thinks cannot be &s;o well verefied of any particular Hi&s;tory, as of that which, being written by divinely-in&s;pired Penmen, is con|tained in the Books of the Old and New Te|&s;tament. Then &s;peaking of the Motive or In|ducement to the Undertaking, Two things (he &s;ays) more e&s;pecially led him to it: One, That the Divine Providence, the Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s and Favour of God, in ordering, di&s;|po&s;ing, providing for, pre&s;erving, defending, and wonderfully delivering his Servants and People out of the greate&s;t Straits, Difficulties, Hard&s;hips, Dangers and Sufferings, being more directly, and in a continued Series and Cour&s;e of Actions &s;et before the Readers Eye, he might be thereby the more &s;tirred up, and engaged to admire and magnifie, to love, reverence and fear the Lord, and be the more careful not to offend Him. The other Motive was, That all, the Youth e&s;pecially, of either Sex, under what &s;oever Religious Denomination they go, might be furni&s;hed with &s;uch an Entertainment, to &s;pend (at lea&s;t) their Lei&s;ure Hours upon, as might yield them at once both Profit and De|light. After which he proceeds to &s;peak of the Manner of Performance under Eight Heads: The Sub&s;tance of which are,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in dige&s;ting the following Hi&s;tory, he hath not &s;trictly tied him&s;elf to the Letter and very Syllables of the Text; but with all
<PB N="447" REF="457">
<MILESTONE N="1705," UNIT="date"> due Circum&s;pection and Care to retain the Mat|ter and Sen&s;e, hath &s;ometimes varied the Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. Where he hath left the la&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation</HI> of the BIBLE, he hath fol|lowed for the mo&s;t part &s;ome other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Latin;</HI> or the Judgment of &s;ome eminently Learned <HI>Expo&s;itors.</HI> 3. As to the Chronology (e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the Times of the Judges and Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI>) he found &s;o much Incertainty, and &s;o little Certainty or Agreement among&s;t Interpreters about it, that he had a Mind to have left it out; but at the De&s;ire of &s;ome he added it in the Margin; wherein for the mo&s;t part he followed <HI>R. Blome's Hi&s;tory of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</HI> 4. The few Helps (he &s;ays) he had, were chiefly from Dr. <HI>Gell's E&s;&s;ay towards an Amendment of the la&s;t</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Tran&s;lation of the Bible. Hugh Brough|ton's Con&s;ent of Scripture, Godwin's Mo&s;es and Aaron. The Annotations of</HI> Tremelius <HI>and</HI> Junius. And for Names of Per&s;ons and Places the <HI>Tables</HI> of <HI>Robert F. Herry.</HI> 5. The whole Work is divided into Three Parts, without any particu|lar Regard had to the <HI>Seven Periods of Time,</HI> into which Chronologers and Hi&s;toriographers, out of a De&s;ire to reduce them to &s;ome &s;ort of Proportion with the <HI>Six Days Work</HI> and <HI>Seventh Days Re&s;t,</HI> in the fir&s;t Week of the Creation, have generally divided the Ages of the World, from <HI>Adam</HI> until now. 6. Of the&s;e three Parts, the fir&s;t reaches from the Creation to the Death of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> being come to the Borders of the Promi&s;ed Land
<PB N="448" REF="458">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="date"> (the &s;econd Time) were ready to enter in; and contains the Remarkables in the Five Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> taking in <HI>Job</HI> between <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> and <HI>Exo|dus.</HI> 7. The &s;econd Part beginning with the Book of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> goes through that, and the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> with the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and carries on the Hi&s;tory from the Death of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the Death of <HI>Saul,</HI> and the Account that was brought to <HI>David</HI> of it. In which are recount|ed the Tran&s;actions of chief Note under all the <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> the fir&s;t Anointed King of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> 8. The third Part (by much the large&s;t) goes on with the &s;econd Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> thro' the re&s;t of the Canonical Scripture, &s;ets forth the Reigns of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> throughout the <HI>Jewi&s;h Monarchy,</HI> with the mo&s;t remarkable Acts and Occurrences therein, from <HI>David</HI> to the Return of the la&s;t <HI>Babyloni&s;h Cap|tivity,</HI> and Re-building of the Temple, taking in the Prophets, as near as may be, in their &s;e|veral Times.</P>
<P>Then he gives Account who hath writ on this Subject; particularly a Treati&s;e called <HI>The General View of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Learned <HI>Broughton</HI>'s; which <HI>T.

Ne&s;s</HI> his <HI>Hi&s;tory and My&s;tery of the Old and New Te&s;tament,</HI> (in four Volumes) A Book (&s;ays he) well fraught with Variety of u&s;eful Matter; but (wittily ob&s;erves) the My|&s;tery is not only interwoven with the Hi&s;tory, but hath al&s;o &s;o much overgrowu it, that the Reader who de&s;ires to peru&s;e the Hi&s;tory by it
<PB N="449" REF="459">
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="date"> &s;elf, will be at &s;ome Lo&s;s in that re&s;pect. And that which promi&s;es mo&s;t to an&s;wer his End, he &s;ays, is, <HI>R. Blome's Hi&s;tory of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</HI> A Work indeed (&s;ays he) not only in&s;tructive and delightful, but pompous and magnificent. A Character that may ju&s;tly be apply'd to his own (except the Word <HI>pompous.</HI>) A Work indeed it is both plea&s;ant and profit|able; &s;uch judicious Ob&s;ervations, and witty (though grave) Turns on Pa&s;&s;ages and Things, as make it (as well as his other Writings) not only plea&s;ant to read, but profitable to the Rea|der. A Work that will remain a Monument of his Worth and Ingenuity to Generations to come.</P>
<P>I would only add, That there is a Book of <HI>Sulpitius Severus,</HI> intituled <HI>Sacred Hi&s;tory:</HI> but as that is in <HI>Latin,</HI> and far &s;hort of this of <HI>T. E</HI>'s; &s;o this cannot interfere with that, or be ju&s;tly thought to be in Imitation of it.</P>
<P>About this time we entred into a more par|ticular Corre&s;pondence by Letters on &s;everal Occa&s;ions; which we continued, at times, almo&s;t 'till his Death.

<P><MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="date"> The next Year, <HI>viz.</HI> 1706, there followed an Intercour&s;e of &s;ome Letters between him and <HI>William Sewell</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> upon &s;ome particular Points; which led into a Friendly Corre&s;pon|dence between them, in &s;ome other Matters not unplea&s;ant to read.

<P>His next publick Work was on this Occa&s;ion. About this time a Book was publi&s;hed by a Namele&s;s Author, called <HI>A Divine Treati&s;e, written by way of E&s;&s;ay,</HI> (pretending) <HI>to demon|&s;trate, according to the</HI> Mo&s;aical Philo&s;ophy, <HI>Wa|ter-Bapti&s;m, Impo&s;ition of Hands, and the Com|memoration of the Death and Pa&s;&s;ion of our ever ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour under the Species of Bread and Wine,</HI> &amp;c. This Treati&s;e coming ac|cidentally or providentially to our Friend <HI>Tho|mas Ellwood</HI>'s Hands (as he &s;ays in his Preface) he ob&s;erved that the De&s;ign of the Author therein was, To re-introduce and &s;et up again tho&s;e <HI>Typical Repre&s;entations</HI> therein treated of, among tho&s;e who have been led by the Lord out of the u&s;e thereof, into a more &s;piritual

<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="date"> Di&s;pen&s;ation. And finding his Under&s;tanding in &s;ome mea&s;ure Opened, to &s;ee the Danger and Mi&s;chief of that Undertaking, and his Spi|rit withal &s;tirred in him again&s;t it, he felt a Concern upon his Mind to publi&s;h his <HI>Ob&s;erva|tions</HI> which he had made thereon, that others might the more clearly &s;ee and readily e&s;cape the Snare therein laid to entangle them, and draw them into Bondage to outward Ceremo|nies, and elementary Shadows again.

<P>Now we come to the &s;econd Volume of his Great Work, the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;tament,</HI> which he had had in Hand at times, for the mo&s;t Part &s;ince he fini&s;hed his former; and when he had fini&s;hed this, he brought it up to <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Friends</HI> Peru&s;al and Approbation: where it was Read, and afterwards publi&s;hed this Year 1709, in Folio, under the &s;ame Title with the former, only as that was of the Old Te&s;tament, this was of the New, <HI>viz. Sacred Hi&s;tory, or the Hi&s;torical Part of the Holy Scrip|tures of the New Te&s;tament,</HI> &amp;c. (as in the Title of the former) which as I gave &s;ome Account of, &s;o it behoves I &s;hould of this. The former Treati&s;e (&s;ays he in his Preface) having found a favourable Reception, he was thence encou|raged to re&s;ume his Pen (which at the clo&s;e of that Volume he had let fall) and proceed to the Methodizing of the Hi&s;torical Part of the New Te&s;tament, in Two Parts. In the fir&s;t Part whereof the Reader will find an Account of the Conception, Birth, Life, Travels, Doctrines, Di&s;cour&s;es, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Burial, Re&s;urrection and A&s;cention of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST (the Author of the true Chri&s;tian Religion) plainly, fairly and &s;uccinctly given; u&s;hered in with a brief Ac|count of the Conception, Birth, Manner of Life, Mini&s;try and Death of his Forerunner, <HI>John,</HI> Sirnamed the <HI>Bapti&s;t:</HI> And attended (in the Se|cond
<PB N="457" REF="469">
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"> Part) with a like Hi&s;torical Account of the Acts and Travels of the Apo&s;tles of our Lord, in the Propagation of his Ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, after the A&s;cention of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour; &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Luke</HI> in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles hath recorded, or the Clue or Thread of the Holy Text leads him: beyond which (he &s;ays) he was not willing to adven|ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In this Undertaking, he &s;ays, he aimed at the &s;ame End as in the former, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Youth e&s;pecially, of either Sex, under what&s;oe|ver religious Denomination they go, might be further furni&s;hed, with &s;uch an Entertainment, to &s;pend, at lea&s;t, their Lei&s;ure Hours upon, as might yield them at once both Profit and De|light; and might be thereby drawn off from mi&s;-&s;pending their precious Time upon other, either hurtful, or (at be&s;t) unprofitable Sub|jects. Then he gives Account why he hath, with the Matter of Fact, delivered the Di&s;cour|&s;es, Speeches, Sermons and Doctrines delivered by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> viz. That the Nature of the Hi&s;tory required it, and that without it the Di&s;cour&s;e would have been le&s;s profitable and plea&s;ant to the Reader; and by that means le&s;s conducive to the End he propo&s;ed, which is to allure him to read the Holy Scriptures with Delight, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the Poet,
<Q><L><HI>He certainly doth hit the white,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who mingleth Profit with Delight.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="470">
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"> After which he gives an Account of his going from Place to Place in the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> to reduce the &s;everal Parts and Pa&s;&s;ages of the Hi&s;tory (in the fir&s;t Part) to their due and Proper Times and Places, which he endeavoured to do, (tho' difficult) as near as he could. But the Second Part (the Acts) being all written by one Hand, the Method (he &s;ays) is more regular, and the Cour&s;e of the Hi&s;tory more clear. Yet the Apo|&s;tolical Epi&s;tles, being without Date, are hard|ly, he conceives, to be reduced with indubitable Certainty to exact Order; which yet he hath endeavour'd to place them right, according to the be&s;t of his Under&s;tanding. Then owning the Helps he had in Compiling this Hi&s;tory, had been chiefly from the <HI>Criticks,</HI> and <HI>Cradock</HI>'s <HI>Harmony of the four Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;toli|cal Hi&s;tory,</HI> with a few Words of the Perfor|mance; which if not done as it &s;hould (nor as he would) yet as well as he could; And there|fore, in all Humility, recommending and com|mitting it to the Divine Di&s;po&s;al, he concludes his Preface.</P>
<P>Next to the Preface is an Introduction, con|cerning the Pen-men of the New Te&s;tament, and in what Language Originally written, and in what Order of Time; particularly of the four Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>Matthew, Mark, Luke</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> what they were, the time of their Writing, and &s;ome particular Circum&s;tances concerning them and their Ends; well worth the Readers Peru&s;al, for the better under&s;tanding the Hi&s;tory, both of the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles. So proceeds to
<PB N="459" REF="471">
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"> the Hi&s;tory; which he deduces from the <HI>Promi|&s;ed Seed</HI> after the Fall, for Man's Re&s;toration, which the Prophets foretold the Coming of, and which he plea&s;antly draws out at large in Order of Time, and explains with the like judicious Ob&s;ervations, as in the former, taking in the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &amp;c. (in the &s;econd Part) in their proper Places (as near as could be) and gives an Account of them, the Occa&s;ion why, the manner how, and time when they were written: ending with the Revelations, which he renders as a Revelation unrevealed; with &s;ome Brief Notes on it. The whole, as I &s;aid of the former, being both plea&s;ant and profita|ble. Both which will remain a la&s;ting Monu|ment of him in time to come.</P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER To Some OBJECTIONS OF A <HI>Moderate ENQUIRER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Robert Snow,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received a Paper &s;ub&s;cribed by thee, and directed to the Church or People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. Which Paper contains &s;ome <HI>Objections,</HI> which (thou &s;ay&s;t) thou ha&s;t heard &s;poken again&s;t us, and wherein thou de&s;ire&s;t to be &s;a|tisfied. To which we &s;ay, It is no &s;trange Thing to us to be &s;poken again&s;t by the World's Teachers, that being no more than befel the People of God, in the Fir&s;t breaking forth of Chri&s;tianity in the World, Of whom it was &s;aid, <HI>Acts</HI> 28. 22. <HI>As concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is &s;poken again&s;t.</HI> But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction, by An&s;wering the <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is, <HI>You own no Day, either the Fir&s;t or La&s;t, as a Sabbath to the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The Sabbath (which was the &s;eventh or la&s;t Day of the Week) was given to the <HI>Jews, Ex.</HI> 16. 29. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. Not to the <HI>Gentiles, P&s;al.</HI> 147. 19. 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 19. and was to la&s;t (as other typical Or|dinances
<PB N="2" REF="482">
were) <HI>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</HI> 9. 10 <HI>till the Seed &s;hould come, Gal.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>which was Chri&s;t. ver.</HI> 16. <HI>the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat.</HI> 12. 8. <HI>who, in the Fulne&s;s of time, did blot out the Hand writing of Ordi|nances,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Cro&s;s, Col.</HI> 2. 14. From whence the Apo&s;tle thus in|fers, <HI>Let no man therefore judge you</HI> (the Saints and faithful Brethren, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 2.) <HI>in Meat or in Drink, or in re&s;pect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days, Col.</HI> 2. 16. which, &s;ays he, <HI>are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chri&s;t. ver.</HI> 17. Thus was that <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which was given by God, to his People the <HI>Jews,</HI> ended and taken away by Chri&s;t, before the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called to be his People. And as for the <HI>Fir&s;t Day</HI> of the Week, we do not read in the Holy Scriptures, that it is called the <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> or commanded to be kept and ob&s;erved for a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> as the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> had been. But, on the contrary, we find the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were <HI>Gentiles</HI> (though not without &s;ome mixture of believing <HI>Jews</HI> among&s;t them, as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 2.) &s;ays, <HI>One Man e&s;teems one Day above an|other</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Jew</HI>) <HI>Another e&s;teem|eth every Day alike</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Gentile.</HI>) Well, what then? Doth he commend the Former of the&s;e, and condemn the latter? No; but he &s;ays, <HI>Let every Man be fully per&s;waded in his own Mind,</HI> Rom. 14. 5. And in the 4<HI>th,</HI> 10<HI>th,</HI> and 13<HI>th</HI> ver&s;es di&s;&s;wades them from judging one another about the Ob&s;erving, or not ob&s;erving a Day, as well as about the Eating, or not eating of Meats; and &s;eems to lay no more Stre&s;s upon the one, than the other. And if the Drift of the Apo&s;tle's di&s;cour&s;e there be heedfully minded, it will appear that, as he &s;ets him who believed he might eat all Things, with him that e&s;teemed every Day a like; and him that e&s;teemed one Day above another, with him that eat Herbs: So he imputes the Weakne&s;s to the Latter, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. and &s;ets him&s;elf on
<PB N="3" REF="483">
the other &s;ide, &s;aying, <HI>We then that are &s;trong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak,</HI> Chap. 15. 1. And he tells the <HI>Galatians</HI> (which though a <HI>Gentile Church,</HI> had al&s;o <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Believers in it) <HI>I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;towed upon you Labour in vain,</HI> Gal. 4. 11. Why &s;o? <HI>Ye ob&s;erve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. So Jealous was the Apo&s;tle, le&s;t any that had been gathered from outward Ob&s;er|vations, and from a &s;hadowy State, &s;hould imbon|dage them&s;elves again in Shadows, and fall &s;hort of injoying the Sub&s;tance, which is the true Go&s;pel <HI>Re&s;t that remains to the People of God,</HI> Heb. 4. 9. Which in the next Ver&s;e is de&s;cribed to be, Their <HI>Cea&s;ing from their own Works, as God did from His. Into which Re&s;t we</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>that have believed, do en|ter,</HI> ver. 3. And in the 11. Ver&s;e he pre&s;&s;es others to labour to enter into that Re&s;t, Now when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>There remains a Re&s;t,</HI> it plainly implies that the former Re&s;t, the outward Sabbatical Re&s;t did not <HI>remain,</HI> but was pa&s;&s;ed away and gone. Nor is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Re&s;t here men|tioned, which is &s;aid to <HI>Remain to the People of God,</HI> was an outward bodily Re&s;ting, from outward bodily Labour, on what&s;oever Day; both, as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for an|other; And, as the entring into this Re&s;t is &s;et forth in the Text, as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. as it is indeed, yet ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, he hath enabled &s;ome, that have believed in his Name, and &s;ubjected to his Power, to enter into this Re&s;t, in this his Day; and many are pre&s;&s;ing after it, as the true abiding Go&s;pel-Re&s;t, which the Legal Sab|bath was but a Type or Shadow of.</P>
<P>The 2d Objection is, <HI>You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by, &s;o as to di|rect them to the &s;aving of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> In this we are mi&s;repre&s;ented. We &s;in|cerely own, love and regard the Holy Scriptures, be|lieving
<PB N="4" REF="484">
with the Apo&s;tle, that <HI>they were given by In|&s;piration of God, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16, 17. and that <HI>they are able to make wi&s;e unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, ver.</HI> 15. And great be|nefit and delight we find in them, reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit, by which they were given forth. We are &s;o far from denying them to be <HI REND="blackletterType">any</HI> Rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we acknowledge them to contain <HI REND="blackletterType">many</HI> excellent Rules, Precepts, Doctrines and In&s;tructions, directing Man and Woman how to walk, that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls. Yet we do not &s;ay (as &s;ome have done) that the Scriptures are the <HI>only</HI> Rule, or the <HI>chief</HI> and <HI>principal</HI> Rule: becau&s;e we dare not give the Hon|our and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures; For the Scriptures them&s;elves declare, That <HI>it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth, John.</HI> 16. 13. And indeed, the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures them&s;elves is not at|tained to in the Reading of them, unle&s;s the Spirit that gave them forth do open them, and un&s;eal the My&s;teries contained in them. So that the Holy Spi|rit is greater than the Scriptures, and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him. For he is able to manife&s;t him&s;elf unto Man, and to lead Man into the Way of Salvation, either with and by the Scriptures, or without them, as he plea&s;es: But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit. Ju&s;tly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God, to be the <HI>Chief</HI> Rule, and yet acknow|ledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule, and pro|per In&s;trument in the Hand of the Spirit, to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk, to obtain Salvation to their Souls, as the Spirit of the Lord makes u&s;e of the Scriptures to that End.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="485">The 3d OBJECTION is, <HI>You deny the Re&s;urrection of this mortal Body, that this Mortal &s;hall not put on Immortality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> In this al&s;o we are mi&s;repre&s;ented: We do not deny, but own the Re&s;urrection of the Dead; Believing, with the Apo&s;tle, that <HI>This Corruptible &s;hall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal &s;hall put on Immortality,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And indeed, if we did not believe this, we might well &s;ay (as he did) <HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Chri&s;t, we were of all Men mo&s;t mi&s;erable,</HI> ver. 19. <HI>And, Why &s;tand we in jeopar|dy every Hour,</HI> ver. 30. But the Lord knows, and we have openly and &s;incerely declared, that we believe and own the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, according as the Holy Scriptures te&s;tify concerning it; Which &s;ay, <HI>Thou &s;owe&s;t not that Body that &s;hall be, but bare Grain</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But God giveth it a Body as it hath plea&s;ed him, and to every Seed his own Body,</HI> ver. 37, 38. <HI>It is &s;own a natural Body; it is rai&s;ed a Spiritual Body,</HI> ver. 44. the rea&s;on of which follows <HI>ver.</HI> 50. namely, <HI>That Fle&s;h and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</HI> And as we firmly believe this; So we take this to be &s;ufficient, without being &s;o curiou&s;ly inqui&s;itive as he, who would needs ask, <HI>How are the Dead rai&s;ed up? and with what Body do they come?</HI> ver. 35. and was called <HI>Fool</HI> for his Pains, <HI>ver.</HI> 36.</P>
<P>The 4th OBJECTION is, <HI>You &s;uffer Women to be your Teachers, that were forbid by the Apo&s;tle, for he &s;ays, that they &s;hould keep &s;ilence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> of old had a &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ion (grounded upon &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tood Places of Scrip|ture) that the Salvation of God was confined to them, and belonged not at all to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And this Opinion had prevailed &s;o far upon them, that even tho&s;e of them that received the Go&s;pel could not ea&s;ily &s;hake it off. In &s;o much that, after <HI>Peter</HI> had been with <HI>Cornelius</HI> the <HI>Centurion,</HI> and was come
<PB N="6" REF="486">
back again to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he was called before the Church for it, <HI>they that were of the Circumci&s;ion con|tending with him,</HI> and <HI>&s;aying, Thou went'&s;t in to Men uncircumci&s;ed, and did'&s;t eat with them,</HI> Act. 11. 2, 3. To whom, having related the Occa&s;ion and Particulars of that Matter, he concludes his Defence thus, <HI>For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, what was I, that I could with&s;tand God?</HI> ver. 17. And in the next ver&s;e it follows, <HI>when they heard the&s;e Things they held their Peace, and glo|rified God,</HI> &amp;c. This An&s;wer, which the Apo&s;tle gave in that Ca&s;e, may be &s;uitable (we think) for us to give in this Ca&s;e, to &s;uch as (from &s;ome mi&s;under|&s;tood Places of Scripture) are offended at us for Suf|fering Women to &s;peak in our A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>viz.</HI> For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, what are we that we &s;hould with&s;tand God? God, by his Servant <HI>Joel,</HI> in the Time of the Law, had made this Promi&s;e, with Relation to the Times of the Go&s;pel, <HI>viz. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s afterwards</HI> (<HI>or in the la&s;t Days, as</HI> Peter <HI>repeats it,</HI> Act. 2. 17.) <HI>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and your Sons and your Daughters &s;hall prophecy, your old Men &s;hall dream Dreams, your young Men &s;hall &s;ee Vi&s;ions: And al&s;o upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in tho&s;e Days will I pour out my Spirit,</HI> Joel 2. 28, 29. (And they &s;hall prophecy, adds <HI>Peter,</HI> Act. 2. 18.) Here was no Di&s;tinction of Sex made; But this Promi&s;e of <HI>pouring out the Spirit,</HI> and of <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> thereby, is extended as expre&s;ly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons, to the Handmaids as to the Servants. And this the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> doth expre&s;ly apply to that great <HI>pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church,</HI> at the Penteco&s;t immediately after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen|&s;ion, &s;aying, <HI>This is that which was &s;poken by the Pro|phet Joel,</HI> Acts 2. 16. Now at that great and emi|nent
<PB N="7" REF="487">
pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Wo|men were not excluded: For when, after the A&s;cen|tion, the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples were returned from Mount <HI>Oliver</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>The&s;e all con|tinued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and Mary the Mother of Je&s;us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 14. <HI>The Number of the Names together being a|bout an Hundred and Twenty,</HI> ver. 15. <HI>And when the Day of Penteco&s;t was fully come, they were <HI REND="blackletterType">all</HI> with one accord in one Place,</HI> Chap. 2. 1. And in Ver. 3. it is &s;aid, <HI>The cloven Tongues &s;ate upon <HI REND="blackletterType">each</HI> of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, and began to &s;peak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut|terance,</HI> ver. 4. Here was no Di&s;tinction made, no &s;hutting out the Women; but all were together, all received the Gift of the Spirit, and began to <HI>&s;peake with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut|terance.</HI> Nor was it thus only at that time, and up|on that extraordinary Occa&s;ion, but continued in the Church afterwards. For we read <HI>that Philip the Evangeli&s;t had four Daughters that did prophe&s;ie,</HI> Acts 21. 8, 9. <HI>Phebe,</HI> a Woman, is recommended by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to the Church at <HI>Rome,</HI> not only as a <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> but as a <HI>Servant of the Church,</HI> Rom. 16. 1. <HI>Pri&s;cilla,</HI> a Woman, is called by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, <HI>My Helper</HI> (or Fellow Labourer) <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> ver. 3. <HI>Tryphena</HI> and <HI>Trypho&s;a,</HI> two Godly Women, are &s;aluted by him as <HI>Labourers in the Lord.</HI> And of the beloved <HI>Per&s;is,</HI> another holy Woman, he te&s;ti|fies, that <HI>&s;he laboured much in the Lord,</HI> ver. 12. The &s;ame Apo&s;tle, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I entreat thee al&s;o, true Yoke Fellow, help tho&s;e Women which laboured with me in the Go&s;pel,</HI> Phil. 4. 3. Which is the Phra&s;e by which the Apo&s;tle doth frequently expre&s;s his own Mini&s;try; and which he particu|larly applies to <HI>Timotheus,</HI> whom he calls <HI>Our Bro|ther and Mini&s;ter of God, and our Fellow Labourer in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 The&s;. 3. 2. Which is a clear Evi|dence
<PB N="8" REF="488">
that tho&s;e Women, that had received the Gift of Prophe&s;y, did mini&s;ter therein to the Edification of the Church, as well as the Men. Nay the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in that very Epi&s;tle, wherein he is thought by &s;ome to di&s;countenance <HI>Womens Preaching,</HI> doth give Directions for the Manner of their <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Pro|phe&s;ying,</HI> viz. <HI>That they &s;hould do it with their Heads covered.</HI> For having fir&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Every Man praying or prophe&s;ying, having his Head covered, di&s;honoureth his Head,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 4. He adds, <HI>But every Woman that Prayeth or Prophe&s;yeth with her Head uncovered di&s;|honoureth her Head,</HI> ver. 5. This puts it out of doubt, that Womens <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> in the Church, was at that Time both lawful and u&s;ual, as well as Mens.</P>
<P>Now, that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> here is meant <HI>Preaching</HI> (not barely foretelling Things to come) may not only be inferred from the u&s;e of the &s;ame Word in the ver&s;e foregoing, where, being &s;poken of Men, it is granted on all Hands to intend <HI>Preaching</HI> (and from thence the general practice of <HI>Mens Preaching uncovered</HI> is defended) but may al&s;o fairly be con|cluded, from the explanation the Apo&s;tle gives of it, in Chap. 14. ver. 31. where he tells that Church in general, <HI>We may all Prophe&s;y one by one that <HI REND="blackletterType">all</HI> may <HI REND="blackletterType">learn</HI></HI>; Which manife&s;ts that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> he in|tended <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper way or means of <HI>Learning.</HI> And in the Beginning of that Chapter, where he prefers <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> before <HI>Speaking whith Tongues,</HI> ver. 1. and 5. he &s;ays, <HI>He that Prophe&s;yeth, Speaketh unto Men, to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort,</HI> ver. 3. And, <HI>He that Pro|phe&s;yeth, Edifieth the Church,</HI> ver. 4. which plainly &s;hew that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper means or way of E|difying. And therefore, &s;eeing he not only allowed Women to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> but directed and advi&s;ed them how they &s;hould perform it, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 5. and that in
<PB N="9" REF="489">
this Place <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> appear to be one and the &s;ame Thing, it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e he denied them the Liberty of <HI>Preaching,</HI> being gifted and called thereunto. As for tho&s;e Words of his, 1 Cor. 14. 34. <HI>Let your Women keep &s;ilence in the Churches: for it is not permitted unto them to &s;peak; but to be under Obedience, as al&s;o &s;aith the Law.</HI> Ob|&s;erve fir&s;t, that tho&s;e Words, [<HI>as al&s;o &s;aith the Law</HI>] relate only to the Womens being under <HI>Obedience,</HI> not to their keeping <HI>&s;ilence</HI> in the Church: For that was never enjoyned them in the Law, but they were permitted to &s;peak in the Congregation; And both <HI>Miriam,</HI> who was a Prophete&s;s, did &s;ing the Tri|umphs of the Lord, in the publick Congregation, <HI>Ex.</HI> 15. 20. 21. And <HI>Deborah,</HI> who was a Prophete&s;s, did recount the noble Acts of the Lord, and cele|brate his Prai&s;es in a Triumphant Song, <HI>Judges</HI> 5. Read al&s;o what <HI>Hanna</HI> &s;pake in the Hou&s;e of the Lord in <HI>Shiloh,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. And <HI>Anna,</HI> who was a Pro|phete&s;s, did not only give thanks unto the Lord, but &s;pake of Chri&s;t to all them that looked for Redem|ption in <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Luke</HI> 2. 38. This was direct <HI>Preaching,</HI> and that <HI>in the Temple.</HI> So that the Wo|men were not enjoyned <HI>&s;ilence</HI> under the Law, but were permitted to <HI>Speak.</HI> In the next Place, con|&s;ider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apo&s;tle in that Place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. which from his following Words will appear to be, not a Speak|ing of the Words of Life and Salvation, not a Speak|ing as the Spirit of God gives utterance; but &s;peak|ing di&s;orderly, asking Que&s;tions un&s;ea&s;onably, and out of place; not &s;peaking for the Edification of Others, but &s;peaking for their own Information on|ly: for he immediatly adds, <HI>If they will learn any Thing, let them ask their Husbands at home,</HI> ver. 35. The&s;e Words [<HI REND="blackletterType">learn</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">ask</HI>] plainly &s;hew, that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Go&s;pel for the Edification of the
<PB N="10" REF="490">
Church, but <HI>asking Que&s;tions</HI> for their own Sati&s;|faction, which they might have done at home, but not there: therefore he adds, <HI>For it is a Shame for Women to &s;peak in the Church.</HI> And &s;o indeed it was in &s;uch a di&s;orderly manner as they &s;pake, to inter|rogate or Catechi&s;e either the Mini&s;ter, or their Hu&s;bands, openly in the Church, to a&s;k the Meaning of this, or call for an Explanation of that, which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Hu&s;bands, and mu&s;t needs occa&s;ion Di&s;orders and Confu&s;ion in the A&s;&s;embly; which we may per|ceive was the thing that troubled the Apo&s;tle, and which he laboured to reform: for he &s;aid before, <HI>God is not the Author of Confu&s;ion, but of Peace,</HI> ver. 33. and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition <HI>Let all things be done decently and in order:</HI> So that it was the di&s;orderly Practice of &s;ome Women in that Church which he reproves, who, it &s;eems, when any Thing was &s;poken which they did not under&s;tand, would interpo&s;e, and <HI>ask Que&s;tions</HI> for Information &s;ake, which was uncomely in them, offen&s;ive and trouble&s;ome to the Congregation. This &s;ort of <HI>Speak|ing</HI> was not permitted them, but was a Shame to them, and from which they ought to have kept &s;ilence <HI>in the Church,</HI> and <HI>if they will learn any thing,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>let them ask their Husbands at home.</HI> Of like import are tho&s;e other Words of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle to <HI>Timo|thy,</HI> and probably on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion. <HI>Let the Wo|man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>learn in &s;ilence with all Subjection. But I &s;uffer not a Woman to teach, nor to u&s;urp Authority over the Man, but to be in &s;ilence,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 11, 12. For hence it appears &s;till, that the Occa&s;ion they took of &s;peaking, was under pretence of <HI REND="blackletterType">learning,</HI> wherein they took an undue Liberty to <HI>ask Que&s;tions,</HI> as if they would catechize or teach their Hu&s;bands. But though the Apo&s;tle would not &s;uffer &s;uch &s;ort of Speaking in the Church, as might give Occa&s;ion to any to think that the Women did ca&s;t off the Obe|dience
<PB N="11" REF="491">
they owed, and did u&s;urp Authority over their Hu&s;bands; nor after &s;uch a Manner, as might breed Confu&s;ion in the Congregation, for he was &s;o watchful again&s;t that, that he enjoins the Man to be &s;ilent in that Ca&s;e, as well as the Woman. <HI>If any Man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;peaks in an unknown Tongue,&mdash; let one interpret: But if there be no Interpreter, let him keep &s;ilence in the Church,</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 27, 28. Yet we have before &s;hewed, that he allowed of <HI>Women Prophe&s;y|ing,</HI> and that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching.</HI> We have al&s;o given many In&s;tances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Go&s;pel in that Day; and could, from a living and &s;ure Experience, multi|ply in&s;tances of many Women in this Day, whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Re|conciliation unto, and who, in the quickning Power and Virtue thereof, have &s;ounded forth the &s;ame, to the awakening of many that were a&s;leep in Sin, and turning of many <HI>from darkne&s;s to Light,</HI> and from the <HI>Power of Satan to God,</HI> who are now become living Seals of their Mini&s;try. Neither would this &s;eem &s;o &s;trange as it doth to &s;ome, did they duly con&s;ider. That <HI>God is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons.</HI> But that, as, in the <HI>old Creation,</HI> Male and Female were Created in the Image of God: So, in the <HI>new Creation,</HI> Male and Female are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 28. But, as they that contended with <HI>Peter,</HI> for conver&s;ing with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> when they had heard his Defence, held their Peace, and glorified God, &s;aying, <HI>Then hath God al&s;o to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life, Acts</HI> 11. 18. So, we hope, they that have taken Offence at us, for &s;uffering Women to &s;peak in the Church, when they &s;hall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their Satisfaction, will hold their Peace (as to any Oppo&s;ition thereunto) and Glorifie God, &s;aying, <HI>Then hath God committed unto Women al&s;o the Word of Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="492">The fifth Objection is, <HI>You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls, and are &s;ure of Heaven, when the Scriptures &s;ay, that</HI> the Righteous Man falls &s;even times a Day; <HI>and the Apo&s;tle</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aid that</HI> Sin was &s;till actually in him.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> We do not de&s;ire to boa&s;t of any Attain|ments. Yet we cannot but confe&s;s, to the Glory of God, and the Prai&s;e of his Holy Name, that His &s;aving Health hath appeared in this his Day, and we (through his Mercy) have ta&s;ted of it. Chri&s;t the Saviour, is manife&s;ted in Spirit, and we (through Grace) have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power. Through the tender Mercy of our God, the Day-&s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, and hath given Light to us that &s;ate in Darkne&s;s and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace, and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election &s;ure. As for the Scripture thou mentione&s;t, we do not find that the Scripture &s;aith, <HI>The Righteous Man falls &s;even times a Day;</HI> but in <HI>Prov.</HI> 24. 16. we find it thus written, <HI>For a Ju&s;t Man falleth &s;even times, and ri&s;eth up a|gain; but the Wicked &s;hall fall into Mi&s;chief.</HI> And as the Ver&s;e before &s;hews the Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Words, where it is &s;aid, <HI>Lay not wait, O wicked Man, again&s;t the Dwelling of the Righteous: &s;poil not his re&s;ting place.</HI> So the latter Part of this 16th Ver&s;e [<HI>but the wicked &s;hall fall into Mi&s;chief</HI>] implies, that the ju&s;t Man doth not fall, as the wicked Man does, <HI>into Mi&s;chief.</HI> And &s;eeing all Sin is Mi&s;chief, it &s;eems as if the Fall here &s;poken of the ju&s;t Man, were not a <HI>falling into Sin,</HI> but into &s;ome outward Calamity or Exerci&s;e. However the Place &s;peaks nothing of <HI>daily</HI> or <HI>continual falling.</HI> Nor do we remember that <HI>Paul</HI> doth u&s;e that very Expre&s;&s;ion concerning him|&s;elf, <HI>viz. That Sin was &s;till actually in him;</HI> though we know that he doth, in divers places, run through, as it were, and open the various States and Travels
<PB N="13" REF="493">
of the Soul; in &s;ome of which he cried out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver,</HI> &amp;c! But he re&s;ted not there, but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing, and cries out, <HI>I thank God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> Rom. 7. 24, 25. And then in the next Chapter, having &s;aid, <HI>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit,</HI> he &s;ays expre&s;ly con|cerning him&s;elf. <HI>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> ver. 2. And again, <HI>Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 57. This <HI>Victory</HI> we pre&s;s after; this <HI>Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> we la|bour and travel to attain unto, by a Subjection (through Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance) to the <HI>Law of the Spirit of Life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The 6th Objection is, <HI>Why your Teachers per&s;wade you, that all other People are in a barren and de&s;olate Condition, and are out of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Our Teachers do not per&s;wade us &s;o; nor do we Judge &s;o of all other People: For we our &s;elves were gathered out of various Profe&s;&s;ions, States and Conditions; and &s;ome of us, who had been &s;eeking after the Lord in other Profe&s;&s;ions, can remember, that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of <HI>Light,</HI> which the Lord hath &s;et up, in this his Day, as an En&s;ign for the Na|tions to be gathered unto, and to walk in: we were not wholly barren and de&s;olate; but had, at Sea&s;ons, &s;ome touches and ta&s;tes of the Vertue of that hidden Life, which we were then Strangers to; the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts, and an&s;wering, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the Breathings of our Souls to him; &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as to cheri&s;h and keep alive tho&s;e good De&s;ires which were begotten in us, and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thir&s;t after him. And it is not hard to us to believe, that
<PB N="14" REF="494">
&s;o it may be with others at this Day, who have an Integrity to the Lord, though not acquainted with his Outgoings, and Manife&s;tations of him&s;elf in this Di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life:</HI> And both our Prayers to God the Father, in and through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our Labour and Endeavours, in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts, are, That all the&s;e, in what&s;oever Profe&s;&s;ion, may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains, and gathered into the true Sheepfold. For we remember our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them al&s;o I mu&s;t bring, and they &s;hall hear my Voice; and there &s;hall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</HI> Joh. 10. 16. The Lord grant, that none of the&s;e may mi&s;take his Voice, or di&s;obey it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Objection is, <HI>You deny all outward Ordi|nances, as</HI> Bapti&s;m, <HI>and the</HI> Six Principles, <HI>that were taught to the fir&s;t primitive Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law was <HI>out|ward,</HI> and the Ordinances appertaining to that Di&s;|pen&s;ation were <HI>outward</HI> al&s;o: But the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel is &s;piritual and <HI>inward,</HI> and the Or|dinances appertaining to this Di&s;pen&s;ation are of a &s;piritual Nature. The <HI>Bapti&s;m with Water</HI> was <HI>John</HI>'s, and came up under the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law, nor did properly belong to the Go&s;pel Di&s;|pen&s;ation, though for a time, by Conde&s;cention, continued; as Circumci&s;ion, and &s;ome other Legal Rites, were. And this was that Bapti&s;m which <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t &s;ent him not to baptize with, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 17. But the <HI>Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t,</HI> the true Go&s;pel-Bapti&s;m, that by which the true Believer is bap|tized into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 3. and buried with him into Death, ver. 4. <HI>The one Bapti&s;m,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. is the <HI>Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t and with Fire,</HI> and is plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Bapti&s;m with Wa|ter, both by <HI>John,</HI> to whom the Water-Bapti&s;m
<PB N="15" REF="495">
belonged, and by Chri&s;t, to whom the Spirit-Bap|ti&s;m belonged. For <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I indeed baptize you with water unto Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, who&s;e Shoos I am not worthy to bear: He &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with Fire,</HI> Mat. 3. 11. And Chri&s;t, as <HI>Luke</HI> records a little before his A&s;cen&s;ion, &s;aid, <HI>John truly bap|tized with Water, but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t not many Days hence,</HI> Acts 1. 5. which was the Promi&s;e of the Father, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. delivered by Chri&s;t to his Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, ju&s;t before his parting from them, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 49. Let it therefore be fairly con&s;idered, 1. That the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel is <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it &s;hould be &s;o too. 2. That in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. (From which place the Commi&s;&s;ion for Water-Bapti&s;m is u&s;ually fetched) there is no Mention ef Water. 3. That Bapti&s;m with Water is no where in Scripture called Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m. 4. That Bap|ti&s;m with Water is frequently called <HI>John's Bapti&s;m.</HI> 5. That the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t is called <HI>Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m.</HI> 6. That the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> acknow|ledges but <HI>One Bapti&s;m,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be that with <HI>Water,</HI> &s;ince then he mu&s;t exclude the Bapti&s;m of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> 7. That the A|po&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;peaking of the Bapti&s;m that &s;aves, &s;ays expre&s;ly, <HI>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 21. (which it is the Property of Water to do) as if he had &s;aid, <HI>The Bapti&s;m which now &s;aves us is not Water-Bapti&s;m.</HI> 8. That Bap|ti&s;m with Water is no where expre&s;ly commanded in Scripture, as it would doubtle&s;s have been, had it been intended by Chri&s;t for a Go&s;pel Ordinance. 9. That tho' it was &s;ometimes u&s;ed after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen&s;ion, yet that cannot authorize the u&s;e of it now, any more than of Circumci&s;ion, and other Legal Ordinances, which, in Conde&s;cention to the Weakne&s;s of Believers in that Day, were al&s;o u&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="496">
after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen&s;ion, yet are confe&s;t by all not to be in force now. For <HI>John,</HI> as him&s;elf &s;aid, was to <HI>decrea&s;e,</HI> Joh. 3. 30. which related to his Mini&s;try or Di&s;pen&s;ation, not to his Per&s;on. Now a <HI REND="blackletterType">De|crea&s;ing</HI> implies a growing le&s;s, or wearing away by degrees, not all on a &s;uddain; or at once; and therefore no wonder, if his Water-Bapti&s;m was continued for a time, even after Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m of the Holy Spirit took place. But as Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m was to <HI>increa&s;e,</HI> &s;o <HI>John</HI>'s was to <HI>decrea&s;e,</HI> till Chri&s;t's came to be <HI>all in all,</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s Water Bap|ti&s;m wholly to give place. Let the&s;e things, we &s;ay, be duly weighed, and we hope we &s;hall not be blamed, for leaving the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> and cleaving to the Bapti&s;m of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Six Principles</HI> thou mentione&s;t, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not declared what they are, it cannot be expected we &s;hould &s;peak to them at this time. But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of <HI REND="blackletterType">Light</HI> wherewith Chri&s;t <HI>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</HI> Joh. 1. 9. <HI>In which Light the Nations of them that are &s;aved &s;hall walk,</HI> Rev. 21. 24.

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF TYTHES In GENERAL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE only Command from God, that we read of in Holy Scripture, for the Payment of Tythes, was given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Levitical Law.</HI> Then God fir&s;t re&s;erved to him&s;elf the Tythe of the Land of Ca|naan, <HI>Lev.</HI> 27. 30. Which he did for this rea&s;on, that, intending to take the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> more peculiarly into his Service (as he did, <HI>Numb.</HI> 3. 6. in &s;tead of, or in exchange for all the Fir&s;t born of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> ver. 12. 13. and 45. and Chap. 8. ver. 18. Having before re|&s;erved and appropriated the Fir&s;t born to him&s;elf, <HI>Ex.</HI> 13. 2.) he might be&s;tow tho&s;e Tythes on the <HI>Levites,</HI> for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe, as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 21, 31. and in lieu of, and Compen&s;ation for, their Part or Share of and in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which thereupon they were expre&s;ly cut off from, ver. 20, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Ju&s;tice and Equity, that the <HI>Levites,</HI> thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Ser|vice, and &s;hut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promi&s;ed Land, &s;hould receive a &s;ufficient
<PB N="18" REF="498">
Maintenance from them for whom they performed that Service, and who enjoyed their Part of the Land: Yet the a&s;certaining of the <HI>Quot a</HI> of that Maintenance to the exact Proportion of a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Increa&s;e of the Land, was not grounded on moral Ju&s;tice, but had its Dependence on the Ceremonial Law, adapted and limited to the Polity of that Di&s;pen&s;ation and People only. And that it might not be extended be|yond its appointed Time and Bounds, it plea&s;ed the Divine Wi&s;dom, to &s;ubject it to &s;uch Ceremonial Cir|cum&s;tances, as plainly rank it among&s;t tho&s;e carnal Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impo&s;|ed but <HI>till the Time of Reformation,</HI> &s;poken of <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 10. For as God appointed the <HI>Levites</HI> to be offered for a <HI>Wave-Offering,</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in the Name and on the Behalf of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when he &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es, Thou &s;halt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou &s;halt gather the whole A&s;&s;embly of the Children of I&s;rael together; And thou &s;halt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron &s;hall offer</HI> (in the Margin <HI>Wave</HI>) <HI>the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering</HI> (in the Margin <HI>Wave-Offering</HI>) <HI>of the Children of I&s;rael; that they may execute the Service of the Lord,</HI> Numb. 8, 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes, which were a&s;&s;igned for the Maintenance of the <HI>Le|vites,</HI> were to be fir&s;t offered, by the People, as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> unto the Lord. (<HI>The Tythes of the Chil|dren of I&s;rael, which they offer as an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 24.) And even the Tythe of tho&s;e Tythes, which the <HI>Levites</HI> were to yield unto the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> were to be offered, by the <HI>Levites,</HI> as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> to the Lord, before the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> might have them. <HI>Thus &s;peak unto the Levites</HI> (&s;aid God to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) <HI>and &s;ay unto them, When ye take of the Children of I&s;rael the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance; Then ye &s;hall offer up an Heave Offering of it for the Lord, even</HI>

This makes it evident, beyond doubt|ing, that the Tythes, which were given by the People to the <HI>Levites,</HI> and by the <HI>Levites</HI> to the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> un|der the Law, had their Dependence on the Ceremo|nial Law, as that Prie&s;thood had; And were to &s;tand no longer than that Law and that Prie&s;thood &s;tood: Which was but till <HI>Shiloh</HI> came, and by the Offering of him&s;elf once for all, had put an end to all the &s;ha|dowy Offerings under that Law.</P>
<P N="3">3. This the Author of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> did &s;o well under&s;tand, that he po&s;itively declared that <HI>the Levitical Prie&s;thood being changed, there was made of Nece&s;&s;ity a Change al&s;o of the Law,</HI> (of that Law, by which that Prie&s;thood and the Maintenance of it had &s;tood) See <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 12. And 'tis al&s;o evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity, that neither the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, nor (for &s;ome ages after them) any of the Chri&s;tians, did meddle with, or at all con|cern them&s;elves about Tythes; But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Offer|ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But after that the My&s;tery of Iniquity, which in the Apo&s;tles time began to work (2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2. 7.) had wrought to that Degree among&s;t &s;ome Chri&s;tians, and had drawn them &s;o far from the Purity and Sim|plicity of the Go&s;pel, as to form and model the Church in many things, by and according to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pat|tern among&s;t other Ceremonial Parts of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, which had been aboli&s;hed by the Coming and Death of Chri&s;t, Tythes were preached up again (about the latter end of the fourth Century, and be|ginning of the fifth) by &s;ome, at fir&s;t, under the No|tion
<PB N="20" REF="500">
of Alms and Charity (becau&s;e part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law, were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherle&s;s, the Widow and the Stranger, <HI>Deut.</HI> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then &s;till due by the Mo&s;aic Law, which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Prie&s;thood. Which Plea afterwards (Corruptions increa&s;ing in the Church, and in tho&s;e e&s;pecially who were called the <HI>Church-Men,</HI> or <HI>Clergy</HI>) more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes was re-introduced, as due by tho&s;e Levitical Laws, which had been given to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> of old. And upon that Bottom, Tythes have &s;tood, been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now, not only he that thus claims, and receives Tythes; but he that con&s;ents to, and complies with &s;uch Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu|ally (at lea&s;t) deny that Chri&s;t has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and con&s;equently that he is come, and hath &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind. And that this may appear as plain as is po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall draw the Matter into an Argument, thus:<LIST>
<ITEM>To uphold any Thing, as &s;till in force, which was to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t, is to deny that Chri&s;t is come and hath &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to uphold a Thing, as &s;till in force, which was to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t&punc;</ITEM>

</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> mu&s;t be granted, and the <HI>Minor</HI> I thus prove.<LIST>
<ITEM>What&s;oever was <HI>a part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was to be taken away and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t;</ITEM>

<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t:</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P N="6">6. By this it appears, that without regard had of the Per&s;on to whom, or the U&s;e for which Tythes are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re|ceiving them) being <HI>a Part</HI> of the abrogated Ceremo|nial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> imports a denyal of the Coming, and Death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Hence it is, that Tythes have been, and are commonly called <HI>Antichri&s;tian,</HI> or <HI>a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t.</HI> And hence hath ri&s;en that &s;aying (often u&s;ed not only by our antient Friends, but by &s;ome of the Martyrs long before) <HI>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth thereby deny that Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h.</HI> That Conclu&s;ion could not have been drawn, from the pay|ing of Tythes to a wrong Mini&s;try, or for a wrong u&s;e only, though &s;uch Payment be evil: Nor could any thing ju&s;tify that Inference, but the Con&s;idera|tion that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity and in cour&s;e fall, and cea&s;e when Chri&s;t &s;uffered; the paying of Tythes carries in it a &s;uppo&s;al, that that Law is not yet cea|&s;ed, but is &s;till in force: and con&s;equently that Chri&s;t, who&s;e Death mu&s;t needs have ended it, is not yet come, nor has yet &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind.</P>
<P N="7">7. That other Objection, not le&s;s weighty than common again&s;t paying Tythes to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> &s;o call|ed, <HI>viz.</HI> The unlawfulne&s;s of upholding a fal&s;e Mi|ni&s;try, to perform a fal&s;e Wor&s;hip (being it &s;elf &s;o
<PB N="22" REF="502">
clear and plain, that it needs no illu&s;tration) I &s;hall, in this Di&s;cour&s;e, no further meddle with, than to ob&s;erve in my way, how far it may affect tho&s;e Ty|thes al&s;o, which the <HI>Impropriators</HI> claim. Wherefore having premi&s;ed what is &s;aid before concerning Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what U&s;e &s;o|ever paid, let us now inquire into tho&s;e Tythes, which are called <HI>Impropriate.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Of Impropriate</HI> TYTHES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THAT the&s;e Tythes, which are claimed by the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> are of the &s;ame Nature, and &s;tand originally on the &s;ame Root and Ground, on which the other Tythes &s;tand, which are claimed and exacted by the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> is evident from hence, that they were all heretofore, the&s;e as well as tho&s;e, claim|ed by, and paid to &s;ome or other of the <HI>Romi&s;h Clergy,</HI> or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (&s;o called) and upon the &s;ame Foot. That is, The&s;e <HI>Impropriate Tythes</HI> were paid to tho&s;e Religious Orders or Hou&s;es, as being due to God, by vertue of the <HI>Levitic Law;</HI> as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ed Right, from the &s;ame Law. But how the&s;e Tythes came to tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es fir&s;t, and how afterwards from them to the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> is next to be inquired.</P>
<P N="2">2. Until the <HI>Lateran Council</HI> (&s;o named, becau&s;e it was holden in the <HI>Pope's</HI> Palace at <HI>Rome,</HI> called the <HI>Lateran</HI>) in the Year 1215. It was in the choice of eve|ry Man to give his Tythes to what Church he plea&s;ed, &s;o he gave them to &s;ome Church. And even after that Council, the <HI>Popes,</HI> as Heads of that Church, by their di&s;pencing Power, did give leave to &s;uch as would &s;ue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t,</HI> to &s;uch Order of Religious People (whe|ther <HI>Monks, Friers,</HI> or <HI>Nuns</HI>) as they were be&s;t affected to. By which means, the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts</HI> (called <HI>Seculars,</HI>)
<PB N="23" REF="503">
and tho&s;e of the &s;everal Religious Orders (called by a general Title, <HI>Regulars</HI>) being left to &s;cramble, as they could, for maintenance, the <HI>Regulars</HI> (<HI>mendicant Fryers,</HI> and others) &s;warming in all Places, and pre|tending, at lea&s;t, to greater Sanctity, and Au&s;terity of Life, than the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> prevailed with the People, either living or dying, to give not only very con&s;iderable E&s;tates in Lands, but al&s;o the Tythes of other Lands, and of whole Pari&s;hes, from the <HI>Pa|ri&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> to their Religious Hou&s;es or Convents.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Tythes, or Par&s;onages, &s;o given, were then called <HI>Appropriations,</HI> becau&s;e they were appropriated to this, that, or the other Religious Hou&s;e or Con|vent. And I have read, that there were in <HI>England</HI> about 3845 Par&s;onages thus appropriated. And as Tythes were then held to be <HI>due to God and holy Church;</HI> and tho&s;e Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church: So the Tythes, as well as the Lands thus given them, were continued to them, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, till that general Storm aro&s;e, in K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. his time, which overturned tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es and Orders together. And here, by the way, it may be noted, That while tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es &s;tood, a great part of the Lands which had been given to them, were, by Papal Authority, exempted from paying Tythes: Whence it is, that many of tho&s;e E&s;tates, which had belonged to tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es, remain di&s;charged from the Burden of Tythes &s;till.</P>
<P N="4">4. As Tythes were &s;et up here on the Authority of the <HI>Levitic Law,</HI> and in imitation of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Pra|ctice,</HI> con&s;onant to that Law: So while tho&s;e Reli|gious Hou&s;es &s;tood, and the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Power prevailed here, not only the <HI>Seculars</HI> or <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> but all tho&s;e <HI>Regulars</HI> who received Tythes, were bound to pay the <HI>Tenths</HI> out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church, the <HI>Pope</HI> as the <HI>Levites,</HI> under the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P N="5">5. But after that K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. (upon a Quarrel be|tween

the <HI>Pope</HI> and him, about his Divorce from his fir&s;t Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> which he earne&s;tly de&s;ired, and the <HI>Pope</HI> would not grant) fell off from the <HI>Pope</HI> (though not from <HI>Popery:</HI> For after that, he retained the mo&s;t pernicious Doctrines of the <HI>Romi&s;h Church,</HI> contained in the &s;ix Articles, and burnt &s;ome for de|nying them) he threw off the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Supremacy here, and a&s;&s;umed it to him&s;elf; declaring him&s;elf, and being declared, fir&s;t by the <HI>Clergy</HI> in their <HI>Convoca|tion,</HI> and &s;oon after by <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> in <HI>Parlia|ment, The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of England.</HI> This was done by the Statute of 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. c. 1.

That &s;ince tho&s;e Religious Orders did hold the <HI>Tythes</HI> which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, upon the &s;uppo&s;ed Right of their being due <HI>to God and Holy Church,</HI> which they held them&s;elves, and were by others holden to be a part of; and the King received tho&s;e <HI>Tythes</HI> and <HI>Par&s;onages</HI> (among&s;t the re&s;t of the Revenues of the Religious Hou&s;es) as well tho&s;e that were re&s;igned to him by the Govern|ours of tho&s;e Hou&s;es them&s;elves, as the re&s;t which by Act of Parliament he took, upon the &s;ame Right on which tho&s;e Religious Orders had holden them: He al&s;o mu&s;t hold them upon that &s;uppo&s;ed Right of their being due <HI>to God and Holy Church;</HI> which he then held him&s;elf, and was holden by all, both <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity,</HI> to be the only <HI>Supream Head</HI> of here in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> And as upon that &s;uppo&s;ed Right (of their be|ing <HI>due to God and Holy Church</HI>) on which the Reli|gious Hou&s;es held them, they pa&s;&s;ed them from tho&s;e Hou&s;es to the King, as <HI>&s;upream Head of the Church:</HI> So on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ed Right (of their being <HI>due to God and Holy Church</HI>) they pa&s;&s;ed from the King, as <HI>&s;upream Head of the Church,</HI> to tho&s;e (whether <HI>Spiri|tual</HI> or <HI>Lay</HI> Per&s;ons) unto whom the King granted them. For they &s;tuck not long in the King's Hand: But he, of his own meer Motion, Liberality and Be|nignity (as the Statute in the 33d Year of his Reign, cap. 39. relates) had by that time freely given and granted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto divers and &s;undry of the Lords and Nobles, as well <HI>Spiritual</HI> as <HI>Temporal,</HI> and unto divers and many other Per&s;ons and Bodies politick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers and many &s;undry Honours, Ca&s;tles, Ma|nors, Lands, Tenements, and among the re&s;t, <HI>Re|ctories,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="12">12. But great care was taken to retain, and keep up the Character of <HI>Spirituality,</HI> which had formerly been

&s;tamped upon tho&s;e <HI>Rectories, Par&s;onages,</HI> and other Revenues by <HI>Tythes,</HI> into what Hands &s;oever they were pa&s;&s;ed.

<P N="13">13. And that they might &s;till have Dependence upon the <HI>Supremacy,</HI> care was taken, from the fir&s;t, by the Statute of 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 27. That none of the&s;e E&s;tates, which then had come, or &s;hould come, from any of tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es to the King, &s;hould pa&s;s from him by Grant to any Per&s;on what&s;oever, without an expre&s;s Re&s;ervation of a <HI>Tenth.</HI> And in a &s;ub&s;equent Statute (33 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 39.) complaint being made that, altho' out of tho&s;e Grants, which the King had made to &s;undry Per&s;ons, of Honours, Ca&s;tles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, Rectories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which were under the Survey of the <HI>Court of Aug|mentations</HI>) the <HI>Tenths</HI> had been re&s;erved; yet the Per&s;ons unto whom &s;uch Grants had been made, though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the I&s;&s;ues and Profits of tho&s;e Lands, Rectories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had not paid the re&s;erved <HI>Tenths</HI> to the King: Provi&s;ion was made in that Statute, by &s;everal <HI>Forfeitures</HI> and <HI>No|mine-Poenae</HI>'s to enforce the Payment thereof.</P>
<P>Nor was Care taken of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Head</HI> (the <HI>King</HI>) only, but of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Members</HI> (the <HI>Clergy</HI>) al&s;o: Many, if not mo&s;t, of which had Pen|&s;ions, or Portions i&s;&s;uing out of tho&s;e Par&s;onages, Re|ctories, or other &s;piritual Benefices (as they were counted) which the Religious Orders held: for, be|&s;ides that upon the increa&s;ing of tho&s;e <HI>Appropriations,</HI> whereby the <HI>Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts</HI> were pinch'd, there had been Provi&s;ion made early, in the time of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> for the <HI>Vicars,</HI> as well as for the <HI>Poor;</HI> the Statute of 15 <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. 6. directing, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That, upon the
