<P>Damon and Phillida. Altered from CIBBER into a COMIC OPERA. With the Addition of NEW SONGS and CHORUSSES. As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. GARRICK having allowed me, as Mi&s;s Radley's ma&s;ter, to choo&s;e what &s;econd part &s;he &s;hould appear in, I turn'd my thoughts towards the ballad farce of Damon and Phillida. But when I came to look at it, I not only found that the mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;ted of a great many heavy minuets, and old fa&s;hion'd country-dances, but that there was too much dialogue, without the intervention of airs, which being al&s;o in blank ver&s;e, rendered the drama &s;till more tire&s;ome, as well as hurt the &s;implicity of &s;ome of the characters; which, in the idea, were not contempt|ible: add, that the opening and conclu&s;ion were extremely flat and un-operatical.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3">In order to remedy the fir&s;t objection, I ventured to re&s;et &s;ome of the ballads, intending, out of e&s;teem for our old me|lodies, to let the re&s;t remain, with the addition only of modern accompanyments; but here again I found the trouble would be equal to new &s;etting the whole; and I al&s;o &s;aw, that without the chance of adding any thing to my own little reputation, I might lay my&s;elf open to cen&s;ure, by en|deavouring to mend, what in the opinion of many people, might want no improve|ment.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons I have compo&s;ed all the &s;ongs entirely new: and as the piece has never pleas'd upon the &s;tage, and for that rea&s;on has been very &s;eldom performed &s;ince that great actre&s;s Mrs. Clive was &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated in the part of Phillida: I have taken the farther liberty to make &s;uch alterations in the drama as I pre&s;umed nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I have thrown the dialogue into pro&s;e, added &s;everal new &s;ongs, re&s;tored others
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
from Love in a Riddle, in&s;erted choru&s;&s;es, and, whether for the better or the wor&s;e, made the whole very different from what it has ever yet appeared. With regard to the mu&s;ic, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that while I have endeavoured to give light and familiar airs, I have al&s;o endeavoured to give &s;uch as are neither trite nor vulgar.</P>

<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my good Lord, you are our general friend&mdash;This is my daughter; I have ever &s;tudied to make her happy; and to own the trurh, her chearful com|pliance with all my commands, from her infancy, has rendered that ta&s;k a great &s;atisfaction to me: now, my Lord, le&s;t I &s;hould die, and leave her in an unfriendly world, I would fain &s;ee her well married; and for that purpo&s;e have found her out a pair of well-meaning youths to take her choice of, Cymon and Mop&s;us here; they are brothers; and their manners &s;uit her condition: I am well a&s;&s;ured &s;he might be happy with either of them, for they both love her &s;incerely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CYMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an plea&s;e you, we are both cruelly in love.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little patience, hone&s;t Cymon.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e lads, I &s;ay, my Lord, if there was no ob|&s;truction in the way, might one or t'other make her a good hu&s;band perhaps&mdash;but this &s;oppi&s;h rambling Damon here, has bewitch'd her I think; his &s;queaking pipe has rival'd both Cymon and Mop&s;us, and they toy and play together all day long.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>So nothing now but Damon is thought of, and Damon I fear will ruin her, which would but ill re|compence me for all my care and fatherly advice. The favour I would beg of you, my Lord, is to interpo&s;e your authority in my behalf; and, though you are not our king, 'tis well known you rule our hearts; and the continual good you do us every day, makes it but gratitude that we &s;hould yield to whatever is your plea&s;ure: therefore, if you think my ca&s;e de&s;erves pity, I hope your wi&s;dom will point out to me a way to pre|vent any ill that may en&s;ue from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take your grief to heart, good Corydon, and wi&s;h I may have it in my power to make you ea&s;y; Damon, you hear your accu&s;ation, do you think it hone&s;t to trifle in an affair like this; or that it will add to your reputation to &s;ay you purchas'd this unwary maid's af|fection at the price of all &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, for which &s;he could be counted amiable? Think &s;eriou&s;ly, and tell me what I &s;hall &s;ay I've done to right this good old man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, my profe&s;&s;ions are &s;incere; let the girl plea&s;e her&s;elf: if &s;he has a mind to marry, there's her choice; if &s;he has a mind to make a frolic of life, here's her man.</P>

<P>To &s;ay the truth Corydon, I thought your daughter a little hardly dealt with, in being pe&s;tered with their court&s;hip; but however, Damon who has made her happy, will I hope de&s;erve her, he &s;hall have what I promi&s;ed with her as an addition to her dower, and if I am not very much deceived, will prove, that when a rover becomes a convert to truth, rea&s;on will com|pleat the work, by teaching him to make a good hu&s;|band.</P>
