</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the frail, corrupt, and di&s;tre&s;sful State of Human Nature; when we reflect on the general Lot and Portion of Mortality; when we call to Mind to what Variety of Evils we are &s;ubject, to how many Di&s;ea&s;es our Bodies are expo&s;ed, and by how many Anxieties our Minds may be depre&s;&s;ed and tormented, we are naturally led to imagine that it mu&s;t be the Bu&s;ine&s;s, Concern and Intere&s;t of every Individual to lighten as much as po&s;&s;ible the general Burthen; that every Office of Tenderne&s;s and Humanity to our Fellow-creatures would of Cour&s;e be duly and punctually performed by every one of us, as well knowing that all the poor Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance which each particular could lend, would &s;till be much too little and in&s;ig|nificant Pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the univer&s;al Calamity; that the mo&s;t we can do is to &s;often the Di&s;tre&s;s which we cannot prevent, to &s;ooth tho&s;e Sorrows which we cannot remove, and to pour Balm into tho&s;e Wounds which we cannot heal.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">To diffu&s;e this Spirit of Love and Tenderne&s;s, to increa&s;e this Philanthropy, to make Man &s;ociable to Man, God, the Father, hath implanted in every Brea&s;t a Principle of Benevolence, and God, the Son, hath in his holy Religion &s;trengthened, dignifyed and improved it. This Principle &s;hineth forth with di&s;tingui&s;hed Lu&s;tre in every Page of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; it is taught by his Precepts and enforced by his Example: and there is not perhaps any part of Holy Writ, wherein it is more vi&s;ibly or more warmly inculcated, than in the &s;hort and beautiful Parable before us, wherein the Virtue of Humanity towards the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed is painted in the livelie&s;t Colours, and propo&s;ed to us as an Object of our Ap|plau&s;e and of our Imitation al&s;o.</P>
<P>As the following Di&s;cour&s;e therefore is intended to enforce this Principle, I cannot I think more &s;urely engage your Attention to it, than by</P>
<P>FIRST, Running over, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, the principal Cir|cum&s;tances of this affecting Narration.</P>
<P>AND Secondly, applying them to the pre&s;ent &s;imilar Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>A certain Man,</HI> &s;ays the Parable, <HI>went down from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho</HI>; unfortunately for him, his Journey lay thro' a lone&s;ome and melancholy De&s;art; a Place, as we are inform'd by tho&s;e who were well acquainted with its Situation, &s;o remarkable for the fre|quent Murthers and Robberies committed there as to be called, <HI>the bloody Way</HI>; perpetually infe&s;ted by the Sons of Rapine and Violence. By &s;ome of the&s;e our unhappy Traveller was be&s;et;
<PB N="3" REF="7">
and being unable and probably unwilling to re&s;i&s;t, was quickly overpowered by them. They attacked and plundered Him, and not content with their Spoil, to their Inju&s;tice added Inhumanity al&s;o, <HI>they &s;tripped and wounded him, and left him half dead.</HI> In this mi&s;erable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition he remained, we may &s;uppo&s;e, a long Time, expecting with Impatience the Arrival of &s;ome charitable Traveller to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; when at la&s;t, as the &s;acred Hi&s;torian relates it, <HI>there came down a certain Prie&s;t that way</HI>; a Sight no doubt inexpre&s;&s;ibly agreeable to a Man in &s;o dreadful a Condition; a Per&s;on of his own Religion, and a Teacher of it al&s;o; One who; be&s;ides the common Ties of Humanity, was in a more e&s;pecial Manner bound by his Order and Profe&s;&s;ion to Acts of Charity and Beneficence; &s;uch a one, he had Rea&s;on to expect, would have gladly embraced the Opportunity of doing good, and flown with Plea&s;ure to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; how great then mu&s;t have been his Grief and Di&s;appointment when <HI>the Prie&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by on the other Side!</HI> The unfeeling Man mu&s;t doubtle&s;s have heard his Groans and &s;een his Di&s;tre&s;s; but he purpo&s;ely avoided cro&s;&s;ing over that he might not be obliged to &s;top and relieve him; he re|doubled his Speed therefore, and, without the lea&s;t Regard to the Di&s;tre&s;s of an unhappy Brother, proceeded on his Journey. To add to the Calamity of the poor Traveller, we are told that <HI>a Levite</HI> likewi&s;e, <HI>when he was at the Place, came and looked on him, and pa&s;&s;ed by on the other Side!</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible perhaps to read this Account without making the following reflection. How does every one, who hears the Circum&s;tances of this melancholy Re|lation, dete&s;t &s;uch Behaviour, and abhor &s;uch Inhumanity! and yet at the &s;ame Time how many among&s;t us are guilty of it! Do we not, almo&s;t every Day and every Hour, meet with Objects worthy of our Compa&s;&s;ion and Relief, and yet are we not too apt, with the Prie&s;t and the Levite, to <HI>pa&s;s by on the other Side?</HI> But to pro|ceed.
<PB N="4" REF="8">
What the di&s;appointed Traveller did not find, where he had Rea&s;on to hope, he met with, where he had no Expectation of it. <HI>A certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he &s;aw him, he had Compa&s;&s;ion on him, and went to him, and bound up his Wounds, pouring in Oil and Wine, and &s;et him on his own Bea&s;t, and brought him to an Inn, and took care of him.</HI> The <HI>Samaritans,</HI> it mu&s;t here be remembered, were dete&s;ted by the Jews as Corruptors of the true Religion, and De&s;erters from the true Wor&s;hip: The Traveller therefore, who had already been neglected by the Prie&s;t and the Levite, Men who embraced the &s;ame religious Principles as him&s;elf, could not ra|tionally expect that his avowed Enemy, the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> would take the lea&s;t notice of him; he was notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t agree|ably deceived; for the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> as we have &s;een, performed every Office of Friend&s;hip, every Act of Charity, nece&s;&s;ary on the Occa&s;ion; not content with &s;oftening his pa&s;t Evils and Misfor|tunes, he endeavoured to provide again&s;t his future Wants; when he departed, &s;ays the Parable, <HI>he took out Two pence, and gave them to the Ho&s;t, and &s;aid unto him, take care of him, and what|&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</HI></P>
<P>THUS generou&s;ly and beneficently did the <HI>good Samaritan</HI> behave towards the truly worthy Object of his Compa&s;&s;ion; no Wonder therefore that our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;hould propo&s;e this Ex|ample to the young Lawyer, and di&s;mi&s;s him in the Words of my Text with <HI>Go, and do thou likewi&s;e</HI>; that is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the pre&s;ent <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London</HI>'s excellent Sermon, on this Parable. Vol. 4. Ser. 14.</NOTE> Since you commend the <HI>Samaritan</HI> for acting like a Neighbour to the Jew, do you learn to act like a Neighbour to the <HI>Samaritan.</HI>"</Q> and to every other Fellow-creature in Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9">THE Maxim inculcated in the Parable (and which indeed &s;eems to have been the chief Scope and De&s;ign of it) has been often, but cannot be too often, repeated and enforced to us: Namely, that no national or religious Prejudices, no Difference of Party, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect, or Opinion, no private Jealou&s;y, Pique, or Animo&s;ity &s;hould ever be &s;uffered to dimini&s;h, weaken, or counteract the noble, univer&s;al Principles of Benevolence and Humanity towards each other. The <HI>good Samaritan,</HI> we &s;ee, extended his Bounty and Compa&s;&s;ion to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Traveller, without any Regard to his oppo&s;ite Opinions; he con&s;idered him not as a <HI>Jew,</HI> whom he as a <HI>Samaritan</HI> was at Enmity with, but as a Man and a Fellow-crea|ture, whom he therefore, as Man and Fellow-creature, was bound to relieve.</P>
<P>THE Words of the Text therefore may very properly be con|&s;idered as &s;poken with a View not only to in&s;truct the inqui&s;itive Lawyer, to whom they were immediately addre&s;&s;ed, but as <HI>written for our Learning</HI> al&s;o, as conveying an u&s;eful Admonition to all Mankind, and exhorting them to the Imitation of this illu&s;trious Example; happy are tho&s;e who have the Virtue and the Re&s;olu|tion to follow it!</P>
<P>PERMIT me then to apply the Circum&s;tances of the Parable to the pre&s;ent &s;olemn Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THANKS be to God, our own Times, heedle&s;s and unwary as they are, cannot be condemned as in&s;en&s;ible to the Feelings of Compa&s;&s;ion, or Strangers to the Virtues of Humanity; we be|hold with Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction the Spirit of Mercy and Ten|derne&s;s diffu&s;ing it&s;elf on every Side. That Poverty, which our
<PB N="6" REF="10">
Extravagance produces, our Pity relieves, and we at lea&s;t endea|vour to heal the Wounds which we have made, Ho&s;pitals, Schools, and Foundations ri&s;e up, flouri&s;h, and increa&s;e among&s;t us; and publick Vice and Folly is, in &s;ame Mea&s;ure, covered and extenuated by public Genero&s;ity and Beneficence.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr, <HI>Brown's</HI> E&s;timate of the Manners, and Principles of the Times. Vol. 2. p 40.</NOTE>A certain &s;uperficial and declamatory but fa&s;hionable Writer of the pre&s;ent Age has indeed lately endeavoured (tho' we hope in vain endeavoured) to make Virtue a&s;hamed, and put Charity out of countenance, to degrade our Pity into Weakne&s;s, and melt away our Humanity and Compa&s;&s;ion into Fear, Cowardice, and Effeminacy: But &s;urely Waters thus &s;weet and &s;alutary can never flow from &s;o &s;ordid and corrupt a Fountain. Our Charity, I am &s;atisfyed, ari&s;eth from a nobler Motive. I would fain per&s;uade my&s;elf (and, if it be an Error, it is at lea&s;t an amiable one) that it proceeds from that generous benevolent Principle, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes and naturally &s;prings from the Religion which we profe&s;s, the Religion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the good, the charitable, <HI>the righteous</HI>; from that Beneficence which his example taught, and which only his divine Precepts could in&s;pire. This is the lead|ing, &s;trong, and actuating Principle that directs the Heart even in this otherwi&s;e degenerate Age; it is this, which has already rai&s;ed in &s;o many the Ambition to become <HI>good Samaritans,</HI> the Am|bition of u&s;ing, like him, their Liberty to relea&s;e the Captive, their Health to &s;upport the Sick, their Abundance to relieve the Indigent.</P>
<P>AND among&s;t all the fair Copies of this noble Picture, indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly drawn by various Hands, there is not perhaps one which
<PB N="7" REF="11">
comes &s;o near to the Original, as that Charity which we are here met to countenance and recommend; a Charity &s;o exten&s;ive in its Nature, &s;o u&s;eful in its Effects, and &s;o highly conducive to the Good of the Community, as to de&s;erve all the Approbation we can give, and all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance we can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>THE Almighty Creator of all things hath of his infinite Mercy ordained that Man &s;hall not in this Vale of Sorrow be afflicted be|yond what he is able to bear. The Misfortunes incident to Mor|tality &s;eldom pre&s;s too hard and too clo&s;ely upon each other, and where they are permitted to accumulate, Power and Opportunity are given to Men to divide, and by dividing to le&s;&s;en the Weight of them. Evils indeed, which when &s;eparate may be over|powered, when united become intolerable.</P>
<P>POVERTY, whil&s;t &s;he is &s;trengthened by Health, can &s;truggle with Misfortune; but if &s;he is oppre&s;&s;ed by Sickne&s;s, &s;he &s;inks down, and is unequal to the Conflict; Sickne&s;s, on the other hand, whil&s;t &s;he is relieved and &s;upported by the lenient Hand of Affluence, lifts up her Head, and &s;miles on the Bed of Angui&s;h; but if Penury entereth into the Chamber, her Wounds bleed afre&s;h, her Pains increa&s;e, and &s;he drops into De&s;pair, and Death. What Prai&s;e then, what Admiration is due to that Hand which brings a Remedy for this complicated Di&s;order! Behold a Hand is &s;tretched out; a Building is rai&s;ed to receive the Sick, the Poor and the Mi&s;erable. This noble Charity has provided every Mitigation of the&s;e dreadful Evils which Humanity could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT this Ho&s;pital opens its charitable Arms to receive not only the Sick, but the Lame al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="12">THE greater Part of the Poor in this Metropolis, it is well known, live by the Work of their Hands; they are obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o earn their daily Bread by the Sweat of their Brows; their Support and Maintenance therefore mu&s;t depend on the Health of their Bodies, the unimpaired Vigour and Activity of their Limbs; and when, by any unfortunate Accident, the&s;e are hurt or weakened they are left intirely de&s;titute. In &s;o large and populous a City in|numerable Accidents mu&s;t inevitably happen, which no human Fore&s;ight could prevent, no human Prudence could guard again&s;t. Here, if A&s;&s;i&s;tance is not immediately given, it can be of no Ser|vice; if the Remedy is not at hand to be admini&s;tered, it may as well not be admini&s;tered at all. Before the Erection of this and other Edifices of the &s;ame kind, the Poor in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;sful Situa|tions were left to peri&s;h in the Streets: <HI>The Levite</HI> perhaps only <HI>looked at them; the Prie&s;t,</HI> without regarding them, <HI>pa&s;&s;ed by on the other Side.</HI> Their Pains were either fini&s;hed by Death, or cruel|ly protracted by the Ignorance of Empirics, who lay hold of every Occa&s;ion to try wanton Experiments on the Poor, and play with the Lives of their Fellow-creatures. How noble then, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and how beneficial is the In&s;titution which can prevent &s;uch Evils, relieve &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;often &s;uch Calamities!</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>good Samaritan</HI> &s;aw the poor Traveller, lame, wounded, and &s;tripped, he did not, before he relieved him, a&s;k what Sect, Nation, or Profe&s;&s;ion he was of, <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> or <HI>Sadducee, Jew</HI> or <HI>Samaritan,</HI> but flew immediately to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. To the Honour of the <HI>Middle&s;ex Ho&s;pital</HI> be it remembered, that the Example before us hath in this Particular been clo&s;ely copyed by it. The Generality of Patients are not admitted into this Place without Letters of Recommendation, that &s;o the Merit and Condition of the
<PB N="9" REF="13">
Object to be relieved may be more fully and thoroughly known; a Precaution highly proper and commendable; but at the &s;ame Time all <HI>Accidents</HI> are admitted without Recommendation: In the&s;e Circum&s;tances no Recommendation indeed is nece&s;&s;ary but what the Afflicted carry with them; at &s;uch a Time, but to look up for Re|leif is to demand it of us, and but to want A&s;&s;i&s;tance is to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>BUT the chief Pride and Glory of this exten&s;ive Charity is &s;till behind; and that is, the Relief which this Ho&s;pital be|&s;tows on the weaker and more helple&s;s Sex, when they are mo&s;t weak, and unable to help them&s;elves; <HI>when the Snares of Death compa&s;s them round about, and the Pains of Hell get hold upon them.</HI> Need I repre&s;ent to you, that in this dangerous and di&s;tre&s;sful Hour all the A&s;&s;i&s;tances, all the Conveniencies, all the Superflui|ties of Affluence united are frequently found in&s;ufficient; the Powers of Medicine are too often ineffectual; the Re&s;ources of human Art, the Improvements of human Knowledge are all too weak to relieve the Pangs, and &s;top the Agonies of Nature; at this perilous Time, all the Tenderne&s;s of officious Friend&s;hip, and all the Endearments of Love and Affection are required to &s;often the Di&s;tre&s;s and mitigate the Pains of the afflicted Sufferer. What then mu&s;t their Condition be, who at &s;uch an Hour have no Home to receive, no Friends to cheri&s;h, no Remedies near to a&s;&s;i&s;t or &s;upport them! In Behalf of &s;uch Objects I need not, I am &s;ure, addre&s;s my&s;elf to the &s;ofter Sex; there is an Advocate, I know, within your own Brea&s;ts that will make all I can &s;ay &s;uperfluous; Nature, that be&s;t of Orators, will plead the Cau&s;e of your afflicted Si&s;ters with irre&s;i&s;table Eloquence; &s;he will point out to you your Duty, and direct you in the Practice of it: If you are Women, if you are Mothers, if you are Chri&s;tians, I need not a&s;k your Aid, Protection and Support.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14">HAVING thus enumerated the many Benefits and Advantages of this exten&s;ive Charity, and dwelt with Plea&s;ure on the &s;everal Branches of it, permit me to draw the&s;e Rays into a Point, and &s;hew you this benignant Sun in all its Heat and Lu&s;tre: Permit me to lead your Imaginations to a Scene which your own Eyes may at any Time &s;ee in reality.</P>
<P>BEHOLD a Groupe of &s;ordid and mi&s;erable Beings, their Faces pale with Sickne&s;s, their Bodies emaciated by Di&s;temper, their Hearts depre&s;&s;ed by Sorrow and De&s;pair; ob&s;erve &s;ome of them &s;o weak and di&s;abled as to want the Power of reaching to the Hand that is &s;tretched out to relieve them: Behold others with Limbs broken and di&s;torted, deprived of Life and Motion, and with the Eye of Angui&s;h looking up for immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance; behind them advances a drooping Train of mournful Females, oppre&s;&s;ed at once by the Throes of Travail and the Weight of Penury, and labouring with all their Sex's Imbecility under a dou|ble Burthen: Alas! Nature &s;hrinks, Humanity &s;hudders at the Pro&s;pect. But &s;ee, the Clouds divide, a Dawn of Comfort appears to di&s;pel the Gloom, and beautify the Horizon; ob&s;erve the fair Companion of Faith and Hope, &s;weet Charity, approaching to|wards them; &s;he lifts them up with benignant Hand, and con|ducts them to her beloved A&s;ylum. Pa&s;s but a little Time, and mark what &s;ucceeds to the fir&s;t melancholy Scene. Behold the &s;ame Objects that entered into the Palace of Charity now re|turning from it; ob&s;erve the &s;udden, the a&s;toni&s;hing Change; the Face of the Sick is lighted up with Smiles; the Ro&s;es of Health bloom upon his Cheek; the Warmth of Gratitude glows upon his Countenance; the Lu&s;tre of Joy &s;parkles in his Eye. Behold the lame Man once more rejoycing in the Activity of his Limbs,
<PB N="11" REF="15">
and returning with fre&s;h Vigour and Spirit to labour for your Ser|vice: And la&s;tly, contemplate the happy Woman, bearing now with Plea&s;ure what &s;he had &s;o long borne with Angui&s;h and Di&s;|quietude; &s;he carries in her Arms a &s;miling Infant, ble&s;&s;es her God, prai&s;es her Benefactors, and forgets all her Pangs <HI>for joy that a Man is born into the World.</HI></P>
<P>A SCENE &s;o dreadful and &s;o plea&s;ing; a Contra&s;t &s;o &s;triking, mu&s;t &s;urely warm the colde&s;t Heart to Sen&s;ibility, and open the narrowe&s;t Mind to Sentiments of Love and Compa&s;&s;ion, of Ten|derne&s;s and Humanity. To reflect that by our little Contributions, by &s;etting a&s;ide our Superfluities only, we have it in our Power to produce &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a Change in the Circum&s;tances and Condi|tion of our Fellow-creatures, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s afford that heart-felt Plea&s;ure which is infinitely &s;uperior to every wordly Enjoy|ment: A Plea&s;ure which the Contributors to this noble Charity have felt, and long, I tru&s;t, will continue to feel.</P>
<P>LET us not then, my Brethren, be weary of well-doing; when the Edifice is large and &s;pacious it mu&s;t &s;tand in need of continual Repairs to maintain and &s;upport it: This Charity, as I have be|fore ob&s;erved to you, is in its Nature very exten&s;ive; the Fund, therefore, rai&s;ed to pre&s;erve it mu&s;t be exten&s;ive al&s;o; the Number of Patients who are perpetually applying for Admittance, &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of punctually continuing the old, and earne&s;tly &s;olicit|ing new Sub&s;criptions to it. Add to which, that the Hardne&s;s of the Times, together with the Scarcity and Dearne&s;s of Provi&s;ions of every kind, oblige many to take Shelter in this Place, who little thought they &s;hould ever have &s;tood in need of it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">LEAVE not therefore, my Brethren, this Labour of Love un|fini&s;hed: Let each Per&s;on, already concerned in the Support of this Ho&s;pital, con&s;ider the Whole as one mi&s;erable and helple&s;s Individual whom he has taken under his Protection. The <HI>good Samaritan,</HI> we may remember, not only <HI>bound up</HI> the Traveller's Wounds and <HI>poured Oil into them,</HI> but <HI>&s;et him upon his Hor&s;e,</HI> lodged and paid for him, and when at la&s;t he left him, provided in &s;ome Mea&s;ure for his future Wants. If it would be cruel to neglect an Individual whom we had taken under our Care, &s;o would it like|wi&s;e be, but in a much higher Degree, with regard to the whole Charity. To withdraw the Aid we had once given, would can|cel at once all the Merit of the Obligation; nor would it excu&s;e tho&s;e, who acted in this Manner, that what they &s;ubtracted from one Charity was be&s;towed on another, that it was the &s;ame Stream of Beneficence directed to a different Channel. This is the Child whom we have adopted, we are not to transfer our parental Af|fection to any other, but to con&s;ider our&s;elves as bound in Honour and Con&s;cience to feed and maintain it. I mention this, becau&s;e Charities, God be thanked, are daily increa&s;ing among&s;t us; and the Ficklene&s;s of Men's Di&s;po&s;itions may di&s;po&s;e &s;ome to change the Objects of their Bounty: In this Ca&s;e, as the Seeds of Bene|volence &s;prouted up and blo&s;&s;omed in one Place they would wi|ther and decay in another; Charity would by degrees defeat its own End and Purpo&s;e, and, like the Suicides of our Age, finally de&s;troy it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>MIDDLESEX-HOSPITAL,</HI> for the Recep|tion of <HI>Sick</HI> and <HI>Lame</HI>; and for <HI>Lying-in Married-Women,</HI> in <HI>Marybone-Fields, Oxford-Road.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE happy Effects ari&s;ing from the &s;everal Ho&s;pitals, erect|ed about the&s;e two great Cities, for the Reception of di&s;|ea&s;ed Poor will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the In&s;titution of this.</P>
<P>Nature and Religion patronize every In&s;tance of Di&s;tre&s;s; but they mo&s;t powerfully befriend that deepe&s;t of all Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, Sick|ne&s;s in Poverty. Sickne&s;s it&s;elf will excite Compa&s;&s;ion, though alleviated by every Comfort and Advantage of Wealth. How much &s;tronger a Sympathy then mu&s;t ari&s;e at the Sight or Idea of Sick|ne&s;s embittered by Poverty! Or, con&s;idered in another View, how affecting is the Condition of Poverty di&s;abled by Sickne&s;s! This Affliction, extreme as it is, is known to be very frequent. Mo&s;t Men are inclined, but few, very few in Compari&s;on, have the Power to relieve it. Public Contributions, therefore, &s;eemed the mo&s;t likely Means to effect what the private Bounty of Individuals could not: This gave Ri&s;e, in the pre&s;ent charitable Age, to In|firmaries; and the Continuance and Increa&s;e of the voluntary Sub|&s;criptions, by which they are &s;upported, are the &s;tronge&s;t Argu|ment that they have an&s;wered their End. But as there are &s;ome populous Parts of the Town, which on Account of their Di&s;tance, and the Number of their Poor, receive little Benefit from the&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="19">
noble De&s;igns, it is hoped, that the Situation of this Ho&s;pital, and its exten&s;ive U&s;e in providing for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poor married Women with Child, will recommend it to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Con|tribution of tho&s;e whom Humanity or Religion in&s;pire with Be|nevolence.</P>
<P>&dagger;&idagger;&dagger; The Qualification of a Governor of this Charity is an annual Sub&s;cription of three Guineas; which <HI>al&s;o</HI> entitles the Sub|&s;criber to recommend, and have in the Hou&s;e at one Time, either one Sick or Lame Patient, or one Lying-in Woman, and to recom|mend Out-Patients. A Sub&s;cription of five Guineas <HI>per Annum</HI> entitles the Sub&s;criber to recommend one Sick or Lame In-Patient, Out-Patients, and one Lying-in Woman. A Sub&s;cription of thirty Guineas at one Payment, con&s;titutes the Sub&s;criber a Governor for Life, with the la&s;t mentioned Privileges. Contributions of le&s;&s;er Sums than three Guineas <HI>per Annum</HI> are thankfully received, and intitle the Contributors to recommend one Sick or Lame In-Patient, and one Out-Patient at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>A Committee of the Governors (appointed quarterly) meet at the Ho&s;pital every <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> at Ten of the Clock, to receive and di&s;|charge Patients, and to tran&s;act the other nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e; where every Governor, though not of the Committee, has a Right to be pre&s;ent, and his Attendance is received as a Fa|vour. A Report of their Proceedings is made to the General Court held every Quarter, when the Re&s;olutions of this Committee are approved or rejected.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians vi&s;it the Patients every <HI>Tue&s;day, Thur&s;day,</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> and on intermediate Days, when particular Ca&s;es require it. The Surgeons attend every Day.</P>
<P>Patients are admitted on a Letter of Recommendation from a Go|vernor or Contributor, who may recommend In-Patients, and have Out-Patients on the Books, according to the Regulation above|mentioned:
<PB N="16" REF="20">
And when In-Patients are recommended, and there is not Room in the Hou&s;e to receive them, they are put on the Li&s;t to be admitted on the fir&s;t Vacancy, and in the mean Time are pre|&s;cribed for as Out-Patients. No Security is required for Burials. All Accidents are admitted without Recommendation. <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> being the Day appointed for the Admi&s;&s;ion of Patients, they are ex|pected to be at the Ho&s;pital, with their Recommendations at TEN of the Clock. The Phy&s;icians and Surgeons meet every <HI>Saturday</HI> at Twelve of the Clock, at the Ho&s;pital, where they give Advice <HI>gratis</HI> to all &s;uch di&s;ea&s;ed Poor who &s;hall come, though unrecom|mended, and require it.</P>
<P>The charitable De&s;igns of this Ho&s;pital were carried on for &s;everal Years in two convenient Hou&s;es adjoining to each other in <HI>Windmill-Street, Tottenham-Court-Road,</HI> where the fir&s;t In&s;titution in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1745, was intended only for the Relief of the indigent Sick and Lame: But in <HI>July</HI> 1747, the Governors willing to render it more worthy of the Notice of the Public, by making it &s;till more u&s;eful, re&s;olved to extend their Plan to the Relief of the pregnant Wives of the indu&s;trious Poor: The <HI>fir&s;t Example of this &s;ort of Charity within this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>The great Increa&s;e of Patients, occa&s;ioned by the Reputation of this <HI>two-fold Charity,</HI> obliged the Governors to think of enlarging their Edifice, as well as their Plan, and the kind Benevolence of the Public by Donations, Legacies, &amp;c. enabled them in 1755, to erect a much larger and more convenient Building, in a high and airy Part of <HI>Marybone-Fields,</HI> near <HI>Oxford-Road,</HI> wherein the Apartments for the Reception of the Lying-in, are in a &s;eparate Part of the Building, remote from the Sick and Lame; and that Ladies may conveniently vi&s;it the Lying-in Patients, without being incommoded by the Sick and Lame, di&s;tinct Stair-Ca&s;es lead to each, the Lying-in Wards having no Communication with the Sick
<PB N="17" REF="21">
and Lame.&mdash;Married Women only are admitted (in the la&s;t Month of their Pregnancy) after they have been examined by the weekly Board, and on their producing an Affidavit made before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, of the Time and Place of their Marriage, and of the Settlement of the Hu&s;band, with the Manner the &s;aid Settlement was obtained, whether by Birth, Servitude or otherwi&s;e. And that this u&s;eful Branch of the Charity, the Midwifry Ward, may be made every Way beneficial, and not liable to any Objection, no Pupils will be admitted; the Whole being under the Direction of Dr. <HI>Brudenell Exton,</HI> Phy&s;ician and Man-Midwife: And no Woman what&s;oever, who has been able to prove her Marriage, and her Hu&s;band's Settlement, &s;o as to avoid burthening the Pari&s;h wherein the Ho&s;pital &s;tands, has been refu&s;ed Admittance.</P>
