<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO SOAME JENYNS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I lately read your Di&s;qui&s;ition on Government and Civil Liberty, it gave me much concern to find, that you had not written it in ver&s;e. Such images and &s;uch &s;entiments, &s;uch wit and &s;uch arguments, were &s;urely too good to be wa&s;ted on pro&s;e. And you who have written ver&s;e &s;o long, and with &s;o much facility, are highly inexcu&s;able for not having employed that talent on &s;o important an occa&s;ion as the pre&s;ent, when you had taken upon you to confute <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;o many ab&s;urd principles con|cerning government and liberty, which have of <HI>late</HI> been di&s;&s;e|minated with unu&s;ual indu&s;try,"</Q>principles, let, me add, which were &s;till more indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;&s;eminated at the Revolution by Locke, at the Acce&s;&s;ion by Hoadly, and a hundred years before either, by Hooker; <Q REND="margQuotes">"principles, which you &s;ay, are as fal&s;e, as mi&s;chievous, as incon&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e, as with all hu|man &s;ociety, and which require nothing more than to be fairly &s;tated, to be refuted."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
The pious poet, Herbert, I think tells us, that</P>
<Q>"A ver&s;e may catch him, who a &s;ermon flies."</Q>
<P>Why then &s;hould you di&s;card ver&s;e, when you intended to catch &s;uch carele&s;s readers, as would be apt to fly a &s;ermon? Why, by dividing your di&s;cour&s;e into five methodical heads, &s;hould you make it appear as formal as the grave&s;t pulpit-lecture ever deli|vered by old bi&s;hop Beveridge, or young Bi&s;hop Bagot? I prote&s;t, Mr. Jenyns, I cannot account for this &s;trange proceeding.</P>
<P>However, that &s;uch &s;ort of readers may read you, I have attempted to do that for your benefit and theirs, which you would not do for them, or for your&s;elf: and, unequal as I am to the ta&s;k, have dre&s;t up your two fir&s;t, and, as I think, principal topics, in as ea&s;y and fa&s;hionable metre as I was capable of wri|ting. I know you would have done this much better. But, as my work is but a fragment, I am not without my hopes, that what I have done may be a &s;pur to your indolence, and that you may be tempted not only to correct, but complete it.</P>
<P>But when I &s;ay that I have ver&s;ified you, I take a pride in boa&s;ting, that I am not your mere ver&s;ifier. I take a plea&s;ure too in owning, that you your&s;elf led me to attempt a nobler &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. I had read, &s;ome years ago, your very delectable Eclogue of the 'Squire and the Par&s;on, written on occa&s;ion of that glorious peace, the honour of making which, is to be in&s;cribed one day (may it be a late one!) on the mau&s;oleum of the Earl of Bute. This, Sir, led me to think of giving my pre&s;ent performance a dramatic ca&s;t, &s;o far as an eclogue can
<PB N="3" REF="6">
po&s;&s;e&s;s that title. On this idea, having re&s;olved to make you my TITYRUS, I had not far to &s;eek for a MELIBAEUS. A bro|ther writer, who has of late endeavoured to di&s;&s;eminate principles, &s;imilar to &s;ome of yours, with unu&s;ual, though abortive indu&s;try, immediately occurred to my imagination. And as immediately I re&s;olved to read his more elaborate treati&s;e, in order to enable me to execute my plan with greater exactitude, and better pre|&s;ervation of &s;entiment and character.</P>
<P>Although I mu&s;t own, that this exercitation of my patience co&s;t me many a yawn, yet I found, to my great &s;atisfaction, that this writer allowed for true, what you hold to be fal&s;e, tho&s;e two fir&s;t principles of Mr. Locke, that men are equal, and that men are free <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tucker on Government,</HI> ch. 1&s;t.</NOTE>. I concluded, therefore, that he was a very pro|per per&s;on to di&s;pute tho&s;e points with you. Accordingly, with|out farther ceremonial, I &s;et you both down, not indeed &s;ub tegmine fagi, but, for the &s;ake of the <HI>co&s;tum&eacute;,</HI> in a &s;nug town coffee-hou&s;e, and there entered you fairly into debate.</P>
<P>If on your part, Sir, I have ever done more than elucidated any of tho&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, which you call arguments, I humbly a&s;k your pardon: and on the Dean's, if <HI>I have made him a little too lively and &s;piritual,</HI> I as humbly a&s;k his. I know nothing does &s;o much harm to an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, in the road of perferment, as the bare &s;u&s;picion of being witty. But, as the Divine in que&s;tion has long been a dean, and has &s;worn that he will never be a bi&s;hop, I hope no great harm is done.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
That you may long remain on the illu&s;trious Li&s;t of Pen|&s;ioners, even after the u&s;eful Board, from which you derive that right, &s;hall be no more; that, having changed from Tory to Whig in the mini&s;try of the Duke of Newca&s;tle, from Whig to Tory under tho&s;e, or rather <HI>that</HI> of Lords Bute and North, you may now again change from Tory to Whig under the New Admini&s;tration;&mdash;and (&s;ince we have it on very eloquent evi|dence, that it is now the fa&s;hion for per&s;ons of the greate&s;t con|&s;equence to be <HI>no longer in &s;hackles)</HI> that you may &s;oon cea&s;e to be encumbered with your pre&s;ent &s;lavi&s;h principles, is the &s;in|cere and fervent wi&s;h of,</P>

He &s;uppo&s;es, that a hundred Adams and Eves &s;hould all be produced full grown, and in <HI>conjugal pairs;</HI> and then concludes, that they would naturally herd together, and form a civil &s;ociety, from their in&s;tinctive love of living together as gregarious animals. But, as &s;ome might object that another in&s;tinctive appetite would &s;peedily di&s;turb the peace of this &s;ociety, and that Horace's <HI>tetrrima belli cau&s;a</HI> might make it a &s;tate of war, he &s;agely provides again&s;t this by noting, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the appetite between the &s;exes can have no place in the que&s;tion, becau&s;e it is not of that &s;ort, which renders mankind gregarious."</Q> Yet, as he al&s;o owns, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the mo&s;t &s;olitary animals at certain &s;ea&s;ons <HI>conver&s;e</HI> in pairs",</Q> it is nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;upport of his hypothe&s;is, that all his Adams and Eves &s;hould be as cha&s;te as turtles; and, therefore, I have called them a <HI>cool</HI> hundred, an epithet which, the reader &s;ees, is here far from being an exple|tive, but highly emphatical; for, if the Dean's hundred Adams and Eves were not more <HI>cool</HI> than an hundred pairs of people of fa&s;hion, whom I could mention, it is to be feared, that many of the males in his civil &s;ociety, would not only be <HI>gregarious animals,</HI> but ab&s;olutely <HI>horned cattle.</HI> See Tucker on Government, p. 136.</NOTE></L>
