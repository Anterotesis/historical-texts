<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<Q><P>AS <HI>Poland</HI> lyes almo&s;t in the &s;ame Latitude with <HI>England,</HI> &s;o the Character the Poet has here gi|ven of the <HI>Poles,</HI> &s;eems &s;o exactly to match what &s;ome ill-natur'd People have &s;aid of &s;ome in <HI>En|land,</HI> that he ea&s;ily fore&s;ees this Cen&s;orious Age will be apt to mi&s;-judge him, as if he had &s;ome Oblique Meaning, and that this was a <HI>Satyr</HI> levell'd at &s;ome People nearer Home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">han the Ca&s;tle of <HI>War&s;aw.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To fore&s;ee an Accident and not endeavour to be prepar'd again&s;t it, is a Piece of Policy peculiar to an Author that &s;ets up <HI>To Reform the Errors</HI> of <HI>Petty Stat&s;men</HI> three times a week to no Purpo&s;e; and it adds very much to a Malefactor's Conviction to be guilty of a Willful Crime. Wherefore He had better, either to have kept his <HI>Fore&s;ight</HI> to him&s;elf, or stifled his <HI>Poem</HI> before he had &s;ent it abroad, to the Great Abu&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">im&s;elf, and the Patriots he has taken the Freedom to Characte|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. As for his Skill in Poetry, if it was no better than his Knowledge in Geography, He might have &s;par'd the Trouble of a <HI>Preface to the Reader,</HI> &s;ince there is &s;o great a Differ|ence between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>War&s;aw</HI> in their Latitude, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he fir&s;t is <HI>Lon. 18. 36. Lat. 51. 32.</HI> the la&s;t <HI>Lon. 42. 5. Lat. 52. 7.</HI></P>
<Q><PB REF="3"><P>But the Author humbly hopes all &s;uch <HI>Inuendo-Men</HI> will con&s;ider, that as they can have no Rea&s;on to Think &s;o, but <HI>Similitude</HI> of Characters, &s;o no Conjectures of theirs, ought to pre-judge his meaning, in which he demands to be left to him&s;elf, and expects to be under&s;tood in the fol|lowing Poem as he <HI>Speaks,</HI> not as every prejudic'd Man may imagine he <HI>meant.</HI></P></Q>
<P>How any Man can <HI>humbly hope,</HI> that has the Arrogance to &s;ay, He can be charg'd with nothing but &s;imilitude of Cha|racters, is beyoud the <HI>Reach</HI> of my &V;nder&s;tanding, and if he has not done by the Gentlemen whom he has Injuriou&s;ly treated, as well as tho&s;e who&s;e Reputation is bla&s;ted with his Commen|dation, as if he had actually written down their Chri&s;tian and Sir Names in Capital Letters, then I have no claim to any &s;uch Thing as Common Apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<Q><P>If any are &s;o Weak to tell us, That <HI>Smithfield</HI> and <HI>Cheap|&s;ide,</HI> cannot be meant of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Author pre&s;umes to ask &s;uch People, if ever they have been at <HI>War&s;aw;</HI> and, if they have, and don't know that there is both a <HI>Smithfield</HI> and a <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> as well as a <HI>May-Fair;</HI> and a <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> he is &s;orry for their Heads, and de&s;ires them to &s;tep thi|ther again to Reform their Memories.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> may have Places put to the &s;ame u&s;es as <HI>Smith|field</HI> and <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> and Fairs and Bear-gardens may be in Reque&s;t there; but it is none of his bu&s;ine&s;s, to bring <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Tran&s;actions upon the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Theatre. And any Man of Compa&s;&s;ion has very great Rea&s;on to be &s;orry for <HI>his Head,</HI> who thinks to conceal what was Printed near <HI>Bartholomew-Clo&s;e,</HI> under the &s;orry Artifice of an Impre&s;&s;ion from <HI>Dant|zick.</HI></P>
<Q><P>But &s;uppo&s;e there are not places call'd directly by tho&s;e Names, if there are places apply'd to the &s;ame U&s;es, what has any Body to que&s;tion the Allegories? A poor Au|thor mu&s;t never Write at all, if he is not at Liberty to cho&s;e His <HI>Metaphors,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the nece&s;&s;ary Fi|gures of Speech to help out his Expre&s;&s;ion.</P></Q>
<P><PB REF="4">
He has forgot his Tryal at the <HI>Old-Baily</HI> for writing <HI>The Shorte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> or He would never in|&s;i&s;t upon an Author's Liberty to chu&s;e what Metaphors He thinks fit; for, though He did not pay &s;o dearly for his Be|loved <HI>Ironies</HI> as he de&s;erv'd, yet the Sentence then pa&s;s'd on Him by the <HI>Bench</HI> might have had &s;uch an Effect upon his Temper, as not to make him <HI>unea&s;ie,</HI> but when he was <HI>break|ing through</HI> the Bonds, he was engag'd in to the Government, in being tyed up to his Good Behaviour.</P>
<Q><P>If 'tis alledg'd that there is too great an Affinity in the Story.&mdash;He An&s;wers, If that be True, he is &s;orry for it; but at the &s;ame time he Hopes not, and the matter of Fact ought to be prov'd, before he &s;tands Cen&s;ur'd for Calumny.</P></Q>
<P>Though the Character of the Per&s;ons his Satyr points at are Fal&s;e and Malicious, yet they bear &s;o near a Re&s;emblance to what is &s;aid of them by their Enemies of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Party,</HI> that the Scandal is fix'd beyond an Excu&s;e, and ought to be Ammadverted upon with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, unle&s;s the Gentlemen in Power clo&s;e with the Libeller, and fling off all Deference and Re&s;pect for the Memories of their Predece&s;|&s;ors.</P>
<Q><P>'Tis very hard that a Man cannot Write of the Follies of other Nations, but People will be always comparing them with their own. One would ha' Thought the Au|thor had Travell'd far enough to find out Hi&s;tories and odd Pa&s;&s;ages to divert us; but if neither <HI>China, Poland,</HI> nor the Inhabitants of the <HI>Moon</HI> will protect Folks from being Hang'd, as the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> &s;aid, <HI>for Tinking,</HI> go on, Gentlemen, and if the <HI>Cap</HI> fits any Body let 'em wear it.

<P>An ingennous Confe&s;&s;ion of the Author, who would be thought to take the Pains of Concealing him&s;elf. <HI>If neither</HI> China, Poland, <HI>nor the Inhabitants of the Moon will pro|tect Folks from being Hang'd,</HI> &amp;c. Your Humble Servant Mr. <HI>Daniel Foe!</HI> you might as well have given us your Name at Large, for every one knows who wrote the <HI>Con&s;oli|dator;</HI> and as to your <HI>Meaning,</HI> they mu&s;t be Men of pro|found Stupidity indeed, that cannot find it out by your Gaping, you are &s;o Intelligible your &s;elf, amongst your want of under|&s;tanding. So that the Scandal will be laid at your Door who made it a <HI>Libel,</HI> not at your Readers, who finds it as &s;uch.</P>
<Q><P>Perhaps there is a &s;ort of Affinity among the Vitious part of Mankind in all Countries and Climates; and the Author Doubts not he &s;hould have run the &s;ame Ri&s;que of Mi&s;con&s;truction, had he Wrote this at <HI>Paris</HI> as at <HI>London,</HI> that he &s;hould have been &s;ummon'd before the Court <HI>of Honour</HI> for Libelling the Princes <HI>of the Blood,</HI> the <HI>Sorbon|ne,</HI> or the <HI>Councellors of Parliament:</HI> 'tis very hard it &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> there, and here too.</P></Q>

That where-ever the Similitude of Character pinches them too clo&s;e, they would prevent the Severity of the Application, by Re|forming the Likene&s;s; the Satyr wou'd then have the de|&s;ired Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> By drawing the Imaginary Picture of Outlandi&s;h Devels, really Transform our own.</P></Q>
<P>The Fate of an Author that ca&s;ts &s;uch a Reproach on the Church and Government E&s;tabli&s;h'd, ought not to terminate in a <HI>Scotch Ca&s;ement;</HI> but He, that has offer'd up a <HI>Hymn</HI> to the Pillory, and made it clap its wooden Wings for Joy, at the Reception of its new Tenant, would not be much lamented if the Three Leg'd Tree, a Mile and a half out of Town, &s;hould pay Him the &s;ame Compliment: Since it is not his Reader's <HI>want</HI> of Charity, but his own, that renders him Criminal.</P>
<Q><P>Nor do I apprehend the World will be le&s;s Solicitous about who is the Author of this: Some perhaps will gue&s;s one, &s;ome another; and the <HI>Hawkers,</HI> they tell me, will ac|cording to Cu&s;tom, Cry it about the &s;treet in the famous Name of <HI>Daniell de Foe.</HI> And tho' they might as well Gue&s;s it was Wrote by the Man in the <HI>Moon,</HI> yet I am content, He, or any body el&s;e &s;hould go away with the Credit of it. 'Tis enough that I am out of the Reach of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Re&s;entments, and cannot be Pro&s;ecuted by the <HI>Cardinal</HI> Primate, mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons here toucht at be|ing his Friends, and all of them in his Intere&s;t; and as for the World they may do their Wor&s;t.</P><P>I am their &V;nconcerned Humble Servant, <HI>Anglipoloski,</HI> Of Luthuania.</P></Q>
<P><PB REF="7">When an Outrage is committed, it is but natural to be in Que&s;t of the Per&s;on that caus'd it; and it will not be difficult, <HI>without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Hawkers,</HI> who are more at his Service than his <HI>Handmaids</HI> the <HI>Nine Mu&s;es,</HI> to find that this Label is not, without &s;ufficient Grounds for &s;o doing, charg'd with a Name tho&s;e Prophane Throats are ince&s;&s;antly piercing our Ears with.

<P>To compare a Fool to <HI>David</HI>'s Harp is a little Prophane, as it is to liken Sir <HI>Tho. M&mdash;r</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> who was a Man after God's own Heart, <HI>and huntiug a Qne&s;tion like a Fox a Goo&s;e,</HI> is &s;uch an
<PB N="64" REF="71">
Attribute of a <HI>Fool,</HI> as I never heard of Before, &s;ince a <HI>Fox</HI> is look'd upon to be the mo&s;t Cunning Creature among the whole Four Legged Race.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Satyr,</HI> forbear to Search the Wound too far,</L>
<L>Le&s;t <HI>Poland</HI>'s latent Errors &s;hould appear.</L>
<L>'Its Enough, the Nation knows the Cur&s;t De&s;ign,</L>
<L>Has broke the Project, and has <HI>Markt the Men.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;ees, Heav'n has his Soul informed,</L>
<L>The <HI>Fools</HI> are all laid by, the <HI>Knaves</HI> di&s;armed;</L>
<L><HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> &s;ettles <HI>Poland</HI>'s Fate,</L>
<L>And <HI>Moderation</HI> Guides the Helm of State,</L>
<L><HI>Tis this makes</HI> Poland <HI>Safe, this makes</HI> Augu&s;tus <HI>Great.</HI></L>

<P>Now He has made His Satyr &s;ay all the Malicious Things He could Invent of Her Maje&s;tys be&s;t Subjects, He ve|ry Mercifully calls upon Satyr to Forbear, ju&s;t like a Cer|tain Great General at the <HI>Boyne</HI> who &s;ent orders to <HI>give Quarter, after all his Enemies</HI> had been put to the Sword. If it be true that all the <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Knaves</HI> are laid by and di&s;arm'd, then the <HI>Tackers</HI> are neither <HI>Fools</HI> nor <HI>Knaves</HI> as He has Intimated, &s;ince there are above 90 cho&s;en for Par|liament Men out of the 134. And <HI>England</HI> Thou ar't the Happie&s;t &s;pot in the whole Univer&s;e, and &s;o God Ble&s;s the Queen's mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty.<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Oh may thy Angel guard Her Royal Mind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That Favourites not educe, nor Trimmers blind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For 'tis on Her thy Church and State depend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Her will flouri&s;h, and with Her will end.</HI></L>
