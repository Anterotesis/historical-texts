<HEAD>TO Sir <HI>RICHARD STEELE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Men ca&s;t their Eyes upon Epi&s;tles of this Kind, from the Name of the Per&s;on who makes the Addre&s;s, and of Him who receives it, they u&s;u|ally have Rea&s;on to expect Applau&s;es improper either to be given or accepted by the Parties concern'd. I fear it will, at fir&s;t Sight, be much more &s;o in this Ad|dre&s;s, than any other which has at any Time appear'd; but while common Dedications are &s;tuff'd with pain|ful Panegyricks, the plain and hone&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of this, is, only to do an Act of Ju&s;tice, and to End a for|mer Mi&s;under&s;tanding between the Author, and Him, whom She, here, makes Her Patron. In Con&s;idera|tion that one knows not how far what We have &s;aid of each other, may affect our Character in the World, I take it for an Act of Honour to declare, on my Part, that I have not known a greater Mortification than when I have reflected upon the Severities which have flow'd from a Pen, which is now, You &s;ee, di&s;pos'd as much to celebrate and commend You. On Your Part, Your &s;incere Endeavour to promote the Reputation
<PB REF="5">
and Succe&s;s of this TRAGEDY, are infallible Te&s;timonies of the Candour and Friend&s;hip you retain for Me. I rejoice in this publick Retribution, and with Plea&s;ure acknowledge, That I find by Experi|ence, that &s;ome u&s;eful Notices which I had the good Fortune to give You for Your Conduct in former Life, with &s;ome hazard to my Self, were not to be blotted out of Your Memory by any Hard&s;hips that follow'd them.</P>
<P>I KNOW You &s;o well, that I am a&s;&s;ur'd You already think I have, on this Subject, &s;aid too much; and I am confident You believe of Me, that did I not conceal much more, I &s;hould not &s;ay &s;o much. Be then the very Memory of di&s;agreeable Things forgot|ten for ever, and give Me leave to Thank You for Your Kindne&s;s to this PLAY, and in return, to &s;hew towards Your Merit the &s;ame Good-will. But when my Heart is full, and my Pen ready to expre&s;s the kinde&s;t Sentiments to Your Advantage, I reflect upon what I have formerly heard You &s;ay, That the Fame of a Gentleman, like the Credit of a Merchant, mu&s;t flow from his own intrin&s;ick Value; and that all Means to enlarge it, which do not ari&s;e naturally from That real Worth, in&s;tead of promoting the Character of ei|ther, did but le&s;&s;en and render it &s;u&s;picious. I leave You therefore, to the great Opportunities, which are daily in Your Power, of be&s;towing on Your Self, what no Body el&s;e can give You; and wi&s;hing You Health and Pro&s;perity, I omit to dwell upon &s;ome very late
<PB REF="6">
Actions of Yours in Publick, which unhappy Preju|dices made, as little expected from You, as the Zeal and Sollicitude which You &s;hew'd for my private In|tere&s;ts in the Succe&s;s of this PLAY. I &s;hall &s;ay no more, tru&s;ting to the Gallantry of Your Temper for further Proofs of Friend&s;hip; and allowing You, like a true Woman, all the good Qualities in the World now I am Pleas'd with You, as well as I gave You all the ill One's when I was Angry with You: I remain with the greate&s;t Truth,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Cannot &s;uffer this <HI>PLAY</HI> to pa&s;s into the World, without expre&s;&s;ing my Gratitude to the Ladies, who, in &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing Manner, graced and &s;upported it. So much Beauty and good Nature, could not fail of rend'ring that Per&s;on happy, for who&s;e Benefit they were employ'd: I think my &s;elf infinitely ble&s;s'd in their Smiles, &s;ince I can be &s;en&s;ible of no greater Glory, than to hear, that I have had the Honour to Plea&s;e Them.</P>
<P>TO tell the World that Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Old|field's</HI> Action was admirable, in the Parts of <HI>LUCIUS</HI> and <HI>ROSALINDA,</HI> is &s;aying nothing New; they are &s;o us'd to Charm the Audience, and Delight the be&s;t Judges of the Theatre: However, I beg leave to make them my publick Acknowledgments, and to plea&s;e my &s;elf with what I have heard reported of their Per|formance in this <HI>PLAY,</HI> which is, That tho' they have

often &s;hin'd in &s;everal greater Parts, yet, none ever became them better. Mr. <HI>Booth's</HI> ma&s;terly and grace|ful Action &s;upported <HI>LUCIUS;</HI> whil&s;t Mrs. <HI>Old|field's</HI> Charms, and enchanting Manner, gave Life and Beauty to the <HI>QUEEN.</HI></P>

<L>IN ancient Days (the Time we do not know,</L>
