<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following E&s;&s;ay contains a bold, but a gene|ral, and therefore I hope an inoffen&s;ive Satyr; e&s;pecially &s;ince 'tis writ with an Intention to hurt none, and to do good to all. It neither reflects upon Per&s;ons nor Parties, but is levell'd at Vices, and not Men. The De&s;ign of it is to &s;hew what <HI>Publick Spi|rit</HI> is, and in what Condition it has been for &s;everal Years among&s;t us; and that 'tis only to be retriev'd by that <HI>Reformation of Manners</HI> which the late King and Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty have often, with &s;o much Wi&s;dom, as well as with &s;o much Religion, re|commended from the Throne.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
The Re&s;toration of <HI>Publick Spirit</HI> is certainly of the utmo&s;t Importance to the Duration of Publick Li|berty, of which 'tis the only &s;olid and la&s;ting Ba&s;is. And tho' Liberty is at pre&s;ent perfectly &s;ecure under the Reign of the Be&s;t of Queens, tho' it is threaten'd with no Danger from the Immediate Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, 'tis yet the Duty of &s;o great, &s;o wi&s;e, and &s;o brave a People, to tran&s;mit to their late&s;t Po&s;terity the Rights and Privileges which they have receiv'd from their remote&s;t Ance&s;tors; and they ought to take the more Care of this at a Sea&s;on, when &s;uch contagious Di&s;tempers rage throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> as may make a great Alteration in the Line of Succe&s;&s;ion in a little time.</P>
<P>The modern State&s;men and Legi&s;lators of free Na|tions &s;eem to me to have been for the mo&s;t part em|ploy'd, rather in remedying than in preventing great Di&s;orders, and to have been more taken up in provi|ding again&s;t the immediate Political Occa&s;ions of them, than in removing the Moral and the Natural Cau&s;es of them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e two important ones, the Edu|cation of Youth, and the re&s;training of Luxury in the elder &s;ort, of which the wi&s;e Ancients took &s;uch pecu|liar Care.</P>
<P>'Tis morally impo&s;&s;ible that Liberty and Luxury &s;hould live any where &s;o long in &s;o &s;trict a Con&s;ederacy as they have done at <HI>Venice</HI>; which is &s;ecure from Faction by the Harmony of its Orders, and from In|va&s;ion by its Scitution. But in a mix'd Monarchy like curs, where we are neither &s;ecure from Divi&s;ion by our Con&s;titution, (tho' that Con&s;titution may for ought I know be the be&s;t that we are capable of) nor from Inva&s;ion by our Scituation, both which are too evident from Hi&s;tory and Experience, Luxury that
<PB N="v" REF="4">
nouri&s;hes our Pa&s;&s;ions, and augments our Wants, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity inflame our Factions, and augment our Divi&s;ions, and cannot be with too much Care repre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>If what is here publi&s;h'd is favourably receiv'd, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew in a Second Part the mighty Mi&s;chiefs that the Introduction of foreign Manners and foreign Luxury hath done to this I&s;land, and to the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI>; and the proper Methods that are to be us'd to re&s;train Luxury, and to retrieve <HI>Publick Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s the <HI>Reformation of Manners</HI> ought to be one of the peculiar Provinces of the Clergy: But at a time when they too often &s;toop from their Sera|phick Contemplations, and the high Dignity of their Function, to intermeddle in Human Affairs, they give us &s;trong Temptations to make Repri&s;als upon them, and to entrench upon an Office which is properly theirs. I believe it will appear by the following Draught of the <HI>Publick Manners,</HI> that 'tis not for want of Bu|&s;ine&s;s proper to their Function, that they pollute the Church with Matters peculiar to the State. Which Proceeding is the more difficult to be accounted for, becau&s;e by doing their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, that is, by con|verting the Souls, and reforming the Manners of Men, they would make an admirable Provi&s;ion for the Safe|ty and Quiet of the Government; whereas by their medling in Civil Matters, they never fail to inflame Mens Pa&s;&s;ions, to corrupt their Manners, to heighten their Animo&s;ities, to augment their Divi&s;ions, and to rai&s;e Convul&s;ions in the State.</P>
<P>However, neither the Clergy, nor the Lay-Societies for the <HI>Reformation of Manners,</HI> can employ the mo&s;t effectual Method, I mean according to Human Ap|pearance, for the immediate Suppre&s;&s;ion of bare-fac'd
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Luxury, the &s;preading Contagion of which is the greate&s;t Corrupter of the Publick Manners, and the greate&s;t Extingui&s;her of <HI>Publick Spirit.</HI> That Method can be only practis'd by the joint Authority of the Queen and her great Council, that is, by the whol|&s;ome Severity of &s;umptuary Laws, or Publick Taxes upon Luxury. And it was partly in order to &s;hew the Rea&s;on, if not the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch Taxes, that the following E&s;&s;ay was begun. For whereas mo&s;t of the Taxes which have been hitherto laid, have been laid upon our Nece&s;&s;aries or our Conveniences; and the Money that is gather'd from both the&s;e, &s;ub&s;tracts &s;o much from the general Stock of Trade, and con&s;e|quently weakens and di&s;courages Indu&s;try: A Tax upon our Superfluities and our Luxuries, will by ren|dring us frugal, and con&s;equently indu&s;trious, have a Tendency to the augmenting the National Stock of Trade. Be&s;ides 'tis plain, that a Tax upon our Su|perfltities and our Luxuries will do good to the whole Community, without being burden&s;ome to any part of it; for few will pay their Money upon &s;uch a Tax, but they who are able to pay it, or who will be ani|mated and &s;upported by their Pride at lea&s;t to pay it chearfully; and &s;o Luxury, that is naturally an E|nemy to Government, will be made &s;ub&s;ervient to it: And they who do not pay their Money upon &s;uch a Tax, will be the more enabled to pay all the other Taxes; which will reconcile &s;uch a Tax or &s;uch Taxes to all the &s;ober, frugal, and indu&s;trious part of the Nation, e&s;pecially &s;ince we have &s;hewn above, that nothing will more contribute to the uniting our Minds, than the re&s;training our Luxuries; upon which Account no Tax can be more effectual for the fini&s;hing this important War, which our Divi&s;ions prolong. And as there will be more Occa&s;ion for &s;uch a Tax upon a general Peace than there is now, be|cau&s;e Luxury unre&s;train'd by Law will in all likelihood
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
then encrea&s;e, and the Encrea&s;e of Luxury will endanger this I&s;land more, than the mo&s;t dangerous Foreign War; Upon this Account it will be hard to invent a Tax more proper to be continued for the paying the Debts of the Nation, than a Tax upon our Vanities, our Superfluities, and our Luxuries. For which Rea&s;on the Act for <HI>prohibiting Immode|rate Gaming,</HI> and that for <HI>preventing of Duelling,</HI> which are two of the fatal Effects of Luxury, the latter of Luxury and Pride, and the former of Ava|rice and Luxury complicated, will be glorious to this Parliament, among all to whom the Pro&s;perity of their Country is dear, among all to whom Law and Publick Liberty are dear. How inglorious has it been hither|to to this I&s;land, which is and has always been govern'd by Law, that we have &s;o long conniv'd at a cruel Cu&s;tom; a Cu&s;tom &s;o <HI>Gothick,</HI> that there is no In&s;tance of it either in <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, and &s;o De&s;tructive, &s;o Arbitrary, and &s;o Barbarous, that Tyranny it &s;elf in a neighbouring Kingdom has not been able to endure it; as if the Tyrant had look'd upon it as an U&s;urpation of his own Tyranni|cal Power, that his Slaves &s;hould have the Lives of their Fellow-Slaves at their Mercy. If any of our Princes &s;hould have taken the Life of a free born Subject, even upon the greate&s;t Provocation, without Proce&s;s of Law, what a terrible Outcry would that Arbitrary Proceeding have caus'd? And yet a Subject not only dares, but thinks him&s;elf oblig'd to attempt the Life of a Fellow-Subject on a fooli&s;h Punctilio, and on a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Whim&s;ey. To what purpo&s;e is it to make whol&s;ome Laws for the Security of Property, when Life, the very Source and Fountain of Property, is every Moment in Danger? This Parliament there|fore has laid the greate&s;t and highe&s;t Obligation upon all their Fellow-Subjects, that Man can lay upon Man, by re&s;cuing them from the Tyranny of a Barbarous Cu&s;tom, and making it &s;candalous to do
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
that for the future, which before 'twas infamous to refu&s;e; &s;o that all their Fellow Subjects owe the Se|curity of their very Being under God to them. By how precarious and how fanta&s;tick a Tenure has Life been held till now, when we were oblig'd to hazard it, again&s;t all Rea&s;on, again&s;t all Ju&s;tice, at the Will of every contemptible Wretch in order to pre&s;erve Honour, as if Honour could be different from Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, and from the Laws of our Country? With how much Satisfaction do all who love that Country &s;ee, that tho' <HI>Publick Spirit</HI> in other Parts is &s;unk and fallen &s;o low, yet we may hope once more to &s;ee it ri&s;e, &s;ince it &s;till flouri&s;hes in the Illu&s;trious Repre&s;entative of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, who&s;e Members are &s;o remarkable, and &s;everal of them &s;o renown'd for their undaunted Courage, that Malice it &s;elf mu&s;t be oblig'd to own, that there could be nothing pri|vate and nothing &s;elfi&s;h in the Inducement to this Bill, which could be introduc'd by nothing but that God-like Motive of an univer&s;al Good.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON Publick Spirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT the Spirit of a Man is to the Body Natural, That, Publick Spirit is to the Body Politick: When the Spirit is vi|gorous, for the mo&s;t part, the Body is &s;trong and healthful; but the Body decays when the Spirit langui&s;hes, and after it totally departs, di&s;|&s;olves, and returns into the Elements, from which it fir&s;t was taken; as a Nation, when that mighty Spirit that animates it, wholly fails, returns into the Ma&s;s of Nations.</P>
<P>Since Publick Spirit then is that, by who&s;e Vigor States are &s;trong and healthful, and by who&s;e Lan|gui&s;hment they decay; nothing &s;eems to me to be of more Importance to the Good of my Country, than a free and a bold Enquiry, What this publick
<PB N="2" REF="9">
Spirit is, and in what Condition 'tis at pre&s;ent a|mong us?</P>
<P>Publick Spirit may be defin'd to be the ardent Love of one's Country, affecting us with a zealous Concern for its Honour and Intere&s;t, and in&s;piring us with Re&s;olution and Courage to promote its Ser|vice and Glory.</P>
<P>Since Publick Spirit then is in&s;eparable from the Love of one's Country, we come now to enquire, What it is to love one's Country? A bold and a dangerous Inqui&s;ition; which, as it will di&s;tingui&s;h Publick Spirit from private Intere&s;t, or from Vain|Glory, will be to many, a provoking Satyr. But tho&s;e People, who are engaged by their Pride or their private Intere&s;t to &s;upport the Publick Liber|ty, would do well to con&s;ider, that they are oblig'd by the &s;ame Intere&s;t to &s;econd and encourage any En|deavour that is made towards the keeping up, or re&s;toring of Publick Spirit; it being certain, that a General Publick Spirit is the only &s;olid Ba&s;is of a National Liberty; and that where-ever that Spirit is not, Liberty is but by Accident: For Intere&s;t may vary, and Pride may change its Object; but the Love of our Country, become habituate and grown up with us from our Infancy, is always &s;ure to re|main.</P>
<P>To love one's Country then, is not &s;o much to be fond of one's Soil or Climate, &s;ince whole Na|tions have con&s;ented to leave tho&s;e with the greate&s;t Alacrity. The <HI>Switzers,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Julius Cae|&s;ar,</HI> were re&s;olv'd to leave their barren Rocks for the fertile Vales of the <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;</HI>; and the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> &s;ome Ages after them, for&s;ook the horrid Climate of the North for the lovely Fields of <HI>Italy</HI>; both the one and the other rightly judging, that where ever their Fellow-Citizens were, there was likewi&s;e their Country.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
To love one's Country then, is to love one's Country-men; but he who loves his Country-men, mu&s;t love them for &s;omething that di&s;tingui&s;hes them from other People: For as he who loves his Friend, loves him for &s;omething which makes him that Individual Per&s;on; &s;o he who loves his Coun|try-men, loves them for &s;omething which makes them that peculiar Nation.</P>
<P>But that which makes a People that peculiar Na|tion, and di&s;tingui&s;hes them from all other Nations, is their Cu&s;toms and Manners. He then who loves his Country-men, loves their Cu&s;toms and Manners. Thus the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> who with the mo&s;t ardent Alacrity, left the Sun and the Soil of <HI>Greece</HI> to fol|low their young Heroe, rather cho&s;e to part with their Lives, than to for&s;ake the Manners of their Country. But as the more Men are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from other Men by their Manners, the greater and the more extraordinary is the Friend&s;hip that is profe&s;t between them; the more a Nation is di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by its Manners from other Nations, the grea|ter is the Love of its Children to it.</P>
<P>And therefore the wi&s;e&s;t of ancient Law-givers took Care, that the People of the Common-wealths which they founded, &s;hould be mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly di|&s;tingui&s;h'd from other Nations by their Cu&s;toms and Manners. Thus did <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> thus did <HI>Lycurgus</HI> di|&s;tingui&s;h the Manners of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Spartans.</HI> The Cu&s;toms and Manners of the <HI>Jews</HI> make a con&s;idera|ble part of the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> and whole Treati&s;es have been writ of the Manners of the <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI> What they did for their real Common-wealths, <HI>Plato</HI> did for his imaginary one. <HI>Plato, in his Laws,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Montaigne, is of Opinion, that nothing could be more dangerous to the State which he founded, than the granting Licence to the Youth, to alter their Habits, and change their Ge&s;tures, their Dances, their Exerci|&s;es, and their Mu&s;ick from one to another manner, altering</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<HI>their Judgments and their Opinions, &s;ometimes one way, and &s;ometimes another, running mad after Novelties, and doing Honour, and giving Rewards to tho&s;e who invent, and who introduce them. By which Proceding, their Manners are corrupted, and their mo&s;t ancient and &s;acred Laws come to be di&s;dain'd and contemn'd.</HI></P>
<P>It was the Opinion of tho&s;e ancient Sages, that the Duration of that Publick Spirit, which they knew to be the Soul of their various Politick Bodies, depended upon the Perpetuity of their Cu&s;toms and Manners. And indeed we find that the ruder Nations have always conquer'd the more refin'd, as the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> the <HI>Grecians</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> the <HI>Romans.</HI> Now the Nations which we call rude, are they which retain their old Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>Since it appears from what has been &s;aid, that Publick Spirit flows from the Love of one's Coun|try; and that to love one's Country is to love one's Country-men; and that the greater Affection any one has for his Country-men, the fonder he mu&s;t be of their peculiar Cu&s;toms and Manners. In order to &s;hew in what Condition publick Spirit is at pre|&s;ent among us, we &s;hall proceed to enquire into the Difference between the Manners of our Ance&s;tors and our own.</P>
<P>But before we proceed to the fore&s;aid Enquiry, it concerns us to an&s;wer an Objection, which is drawn from the very Nature of Publick Spirit, and from the Definition which has been given of it. Publick Spirit is the ardent Love of one's Country, affecting us with a zealous Concern for its Honour and Inte|re&s;t, and in&s;piring us with Re&s;olution and Courage to promote its Service and Glory. Now the Nations retaining their primitive Cu&s;toms are rude and bar|barous, and by con&s;equence weak, ob&s;cure, and mi&s;e|rable. The <HI>Grecians</HI> took their Laws, their Learning,
<PB N="5" REF="12">
and their Philo&s;ophy in a great mea&s;ure, from the <HI>Egyptians</HI>; and the <HI>Romans</HI> theirs from the <HI>Grecians</HI>; and we have taken our Learning and Philo&s;ophy from the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Grecians:</HI> Now who can doubt but that That Learning is at once our Defence and Ornament? How could our Navigation have ri&s;en to &s;uch a Height; our Navigation, upon which the Honour and Intere&s;t of this I&s;land depends, but by the means of our Mathematicks, which we have ta|ken from the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and without which we could neither take our Enemies Towns, nor fortify and defend our own?</P>
<P>To which we an&s;wer:</P>
<P>That 'tis impo&s;&s;ible any rea&s;onable Doubt can be made, but that a Nation may take any thing from another, that may improve their Rea&s;on, their Vir|tue, their Intere&s;t, and their Power. Nay, every Nation is oblig'd by Duty, and by the Dictates of Publick Spirit, to do this: But the Manners and Cu&s;toms of which we &s;peak, are &s;uch as di&s;tingui&s;h one Nation from another. Now as it is not Rea&s;on that di&s;tingui&s;hes one Man from another, for that is the &s;ame in all, it cannot by con&s;equence be Rea&s;on that di&s;tingui&s;hes one Nation from another.</P>
<P>That which mo&s;t influences the Generality of Peo|ple, and makes the greate&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion upon them, is &s;omething which is the Object of Sen&s;e; and the Manners and Cu&s;toms of Nations, which we &s;peak of, are the Objects of Sen&s;e; &s;uch as tho&s;e which <HI>Plato</HI> mentions, <HI>viz.</HI> their Habits, their Motions, their Exerci&s;es, and their Dances.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed our Duty to emulate the Virtue and Knowledge of other Nations; but by imitating their Manners, which are the Objects of Sen&s;e, we come to affect their Vices. And as every thing which is Sen&s;ual takes off from that which is Ratio|nal; the aping their Manners, which are the Objects of Sen&s;e, diverts us from imitating tho&s;e good and
<PB N="6" REF="13">
tho&s;e great Qualities, which may augment our Rea|&s;on, and Intere&s;t, and Reputation, and Power.</P>
<P>But here another Objection may be ea&s;ily &s;tarted; for as to tho&s;e Manners and Cu&s;toms which are the Objects of Sen&s;e, &s;ome may ask, Are we oblig'd to re&s;ume tho&s;e of our Ance&s;tors? And as to Habits particularly, would you advi&s;e us to follow the &s;ame Form that was us'd in the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Reign, which time was before the great Alteration of Manners? Why, no; to advi&s;e that would be perhaps ridiculous. But tho' I am not for re&s;uming tho&s;e of our Ance&s;tors, why may we not as well now fix upon &s;uch as are proper and peculiar to us, as we did in the Time of King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second; when, in a general oppo&s;ition to <HI>France,</HI> we threw off their Fa&s;hions, and put on Ve&s;ts, that <HI>we might look the more,</HI> &s;ays the late Lord <HI>Hallifax, like a di&s;tinct People, and be no longer under the Servi|lity of Imitation.</HI> The whole Pa&s;&s;age is &s;o very re|markable, that the tran&s;cribing it, cannot fail to inform and entertain the Reader. 'Tis in <HI>the Chara|cter of a Trimmer,</HI> written, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the Time of King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second.</P>
<P><HI>Among the other Means us'd for the attaining that End</HI> (that is, for the getting all <HI>Flanders</HI> for the <HI>French</HI>) <HI>the &s;ending over the Dutche&s;s of</HI> Orleans <HI>was not the lea&s;t powerful. She was a very welcome Gue&s;t here, and her own Charms and Dexterity, join'd with other Advantages that might help her Preten&s;ions, gave her &s;uch an A&s;cendant, that &s;he could hardly fail of Succe&s;s. One of the Preliminaries of her Treaty, tho' a trivial thing in it &s;elf, yet was con&s;iderable in the con&s;equence. About this time a general Humour in Op|po&s;ition to</HI> France<HI>, had made us throw off their Fa&s;hions, and put on Ve&s;ts, that we might look more like a di&s;tinct People, and not be under the Servility of Imitation, which ever pays a greater Deference to the Original, than is con&s;i&s;tent with the Equality, all Independent Nations</HI> <PB N="7" REF="14"><HI>&s;hould pretend to.</HI> France <HI>did not like this Be|ginning of ill Humours, at lea&s;t of Emulation, as wi&s;ely con&s;idering that 'tis a natural Introduction, fir&s;t to make the World their Apes, that they may afterwards make them their Slaves. It was thought that one of the In&s;tructions that Madam brought along with her, was to laugh us out of the&s;e Ve&s;ts; which &s;he perform'd &s;o ef|fectually, that in a moment, like &s;o many Footmen, who had quitted their Ma&s;ter's Livery, we took it again, and return'd to our old Service. So that the very Time of doing this gave a very critical Advantage to</HI> France<HI>, &s;ince it look'd like an Evidence of returning to their In|tere&s;ts, as well as to their Fa&s;hions; and would give &s;uch a Di&s;ta&s;te of us to our new Allies, that it might facilitate the Di&s;&s;olution of the Knot, which tied them &s;o within their Bounds, that they were very impatient till they were freed from the Re&s;traint.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far the late Marquis of <HI>Hallifax.</HI> But now if the aping them in one of their Habits was in&s;tru|mental in producing &s;o con&s;iderable an Event, as the breaking the Triple League, (for that was the <HI>Knot</HI> which his Lord&s;hip &s;peaks of) an Event, which prov'd &s;o detrimental to the Peace and Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI>; what mu&s;t we not think of that Load of Fo|reign, and particularly of <HI>French</HI> Manners, which have been introduc'd among us, to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of our own, and the Extinction of Publick Spirit, as we &s;hall find in the following Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to enquire into the Difference that there is between the Manners of our Ance&s;tors and our own; as for Example, between the Manners that were in the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Reign, and tho&s;e of our own Time. We &s;hall find that the Difference is almo&s;t infinite: For Religion, which never fails to influence all the Manners, tho' that of our Fore-fathers was a great deal mi&s;taken, yet was it very &s;incere, and con&s;e|quently a great deal better than none. And it was better for Government, of which Religion is the fir&s;t great Hinge, that they were very much mi&s;ta|ken in Super&s;tructures, than if they had boldly and impiou&s;ly &s;truck at Fundamentals. As they were &s;incere in their Religion, they were &s;ound in their Morals: The Men were at once both ju&s;t, and ge|nerous, &s;incere, faithful, laborious; the Women mode&s;t, obedient, cha&s;t, and diligent: Both Men and Women frugal, liberal, temperate, ho&s;pitable. Their Conver&s;ation and their Diet were like their Manners &s;imple; their Conver&s;ation without Fraud, and their Diet without Artifice. Both their Meat and their Drink, for the mo&s;t part, were of the native Growth of their Country, and the co&s;tly Juice of the Grape was us'd oftner for Phy&s;ick, than it was for Plea&s;ure. They &s;pent a great deal of their Time in the Country among their Te|nants, to whom their Ho&s;pitable Hou&s;es were always open. Their Tenants liv'd under them at ea&s;y Rates. They were the Tutelary Gods of the Poor, who in Sickne&s;s had Phy&s;ick from them, and in Health their Food, and in both their Habitations. Their way of Living in the Country, their Diet, their Air, their Oeconomy, and their rural Diver|&s;ions and Exerci&s;es confirm'd their Healths, and improv'd

their E&s;tates, and &s;upply'd them both with Strength of Body, and with Vigor of Mind. So that their Minds were &s;erene, or their Pa&s;&s;ions mo|derate; their Di&s;tempers neither frequent nor vio|lent, and their Children healthful, lively, robu&s;t and nervous. And whenever they unwillingly went to Town, the Occa&s;ion was important, and the Stay was &s;hort; and during their &s;hort Continuance there, they &s;pent not their Time in ignoble Luxury, or in mad Profu&s;ion, nor made them&s;elves vile in the Eyes of the World, by frequenting Hou&s;es of pro|mi&s;cuous A&s;&s;emblies. Their Conver&s;ation lay for the mo&s;t part with their Equals both in Birth and Rank, or with &s;uch as &s;upply'd the Defect of tho&s;e by true Nobility of Mind: Or if at any time, upon the account of Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Humour, or Variety, they were familiar with their Inferiors; at the &s;ame time they took care to &s;hew, that they knew how to de&s;cend with Dignity. Their Conver&s;ation was &s;incere and &s;afe; they were true to their Friends, and ju&s;t to their Enemies; nor did they then, as it were by Con&s;ent, by the means of fal&s;e Dice, &s;o|phi&s;ticated Wine, and more impure adulterate Friend&s;hip, make War at one and the &s;ame time upon one another's Per&s;ons, E&s;tates, and Reputa|tions. Nor did they &s;quander away their Lives in thoughtle&s;s, inglorious Indolence; they were al|ways active for the Good of others, yes nobly active for the Good of their Country, for which they were with &s;o much Zeal concern'd, that every Per&s;on or Thing was dear to them, that could promote its Honour, or its real Intere&s;t; and every Per&s;on or Thing dete&s;table, that threaten'd Danger or Di&s;ho|nour to it: For this Rea&s;on they were Encouragers of Learning and Arts, of the u&s;efulle&s;t Learning and the noble&s;t Arts; for the promoting and &s;preading of which, they founded Colleges, and erected Schools. But they had at the &s;ame time an extreme Contempt
<PB N="10" REF="17">
for &s;oft, luxurious, effeminate Arts; they had an utter Abhorrence for foreign Cu&s;toms and foreign Fa&s;hions, and for tho&s;e who introduc'd them. And their Habits, and the re&s;t of their Cu&s;toms and Man|ners were &s;uch, as very fairly di&s;tingui&s;h'd their Birth, their Age, their Sex, and their Country. The generous Youths were many of them in tho&s;e Days what the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Temple</HI> are now; they e&s;teem'd it infamous to lie idle at home, while their Country was in danger abroad; and a&s;&s;oon as ever they became patient of Arms, they made their own laborious Experience their chief In&s;tructor in War; and plac'd their Love and their chief Delight, rather in warlike Steeds, and in beautiful Armour, than in wanton Strumpets and luxurious Fea&s;ts. Therefore to Men like the&s;e, no Labour was &s;trange or hard, no Preparations of the Enemy dreadful, and no Fortre&s;s impregnable. Their Virtue was &s;ufficient to conquer all. The great Contention a|mong tho&s;e <HI>Britons</HI> was for Glory, and not for Pow|er; who fir&s;t &s;hould march to the A&s;&s;ault, who fir&s;t &s;hould mount the Breach, who &s;hould have the mo&s;t numerous Spectators of their gallant Actions; here lay their Strife, the&s;e they accounted their mo&s;t va|lu'd Riches, this their Fame, and this their high Nobility. Liberal of Wealth, but U&s;urers and Ex|tortioners of Fame, they were contented with hone&s;t Fortunes, but a&s;pir'd to boundle&s;s Glory. Who knows not what numerous Armies of the <HI>French</HI> have formerly been overthrown by &s;mall handfuls of anci|ent <HI>Britons?</HI> Our Fore-fathers Glory had tran&s;cended that of the ancient <HI>Grecians,</HI> had they like them found but Hi&s;torians equal to their Actions. But they who had the mo&s;t Capacity among them always were the mo&s;t employ'd; all exercis'd their Bodies and their Minds together; and all the brave&s;t and the be&s;t among them, were le&s;s willing to relate the Deeds of others, than to have others immortalize
<PB N="11" REF="18">
their own. And therefore both at home and abroad good Manners were cultivated. And as they had nothing of fordid Intere&s;t, there could be no Fa|ction among them; but Equity and Virtue prevail'd more among them by the Force of Nature, than by the Authority of Law. Their Quarrels and Di&s;putes were with the Enemies of their Country. The &s;ole Contention that they had with their Country-men, was who &s;hould be mo&s;t virtuous. And &s;o by the&s;e two noble Arts; by Intrepidity in War, and by ex|act Ju&s;tice in Peace, they made them&s;elves and the State illu&s;trious.</P>
<P>To paint the Manners of our own Times graphi|cally, in &s;o little Compa&s;s as that to which I have con|&s;in'd my &s;elf, would require a much greater Ma&s;ter than ever I can pretend to be. To &s;ay that the Coun|ter-part of what I have &s;aid of our Ance&s;tors is true of the Manners of our own Times, is to &s;ay &s;omething, but not the hundredth part of what the Subject will bear. The&s;e Manners are &s;o various, &s;o complicated, &s;o prodigious, that one might com|pile Volumes of them. There is not a greater dif|ference between what <HI>London</HI> was in <HI>Harry</HI> the Eighth's Time and what it is at pre&s;ent, than there is between the Manners of our Ance&s;tors and our own. This over-grown Town may be &s;aid to be a vi&s;ible, palpable Proof of the Growth of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Luxury.</P>
<P>For <HI>Religion,</HI> never was there &s;o much of it in Talk, never &s;o little of it in Fact: Ten thou&s;and People make it their Pretext, who are the mo&s;t ex|traordinary Hypocrites that ever were in the World; for while they make it their Pretext, they neither care for it, nor would be thought to care for it. At the &s;ame time that they pretend to contend for the Purity of it, they openly maintain and avow Principles that are de&s;tructive of the Fundamentals of it; and are &s;o far from concealing the Lewdne&s;s of their Practice, that they make their daily Boa&s;t of it.
<PB N="12" REF="19">
This was not all; for the Chri&s;tian Religion, the very Spirit and Being of which lies in Charity, and the Effects of it, Humility, Meekne&s;s, Self-denial, Concord, Unity, was made the Pretext for the utter Subver&s;ion of all the&s;e, and &s;etting up in their &s;tead Hatred, Malice, Rage, Violence, Tumult, Riot, Rebellion, Confu&s;ion, Anarchy, which are contra|ry to the very Soul and Being of all Chri&s;tianity. And what appears more incredible than all the re&s;t, it has been reported, that a great many Per&s;ons of Condition have made it their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to ridicule and baffle the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to introduce Dei&s;m; though nothing is more plain, than that to extingui&s;h Reveal'd Religion, is to introduce Anarchy. For there never was from the Beginning of the World to this Day any man|ner of Government without Revelation, pretended or true, and never can be as long as the World en|dures. The e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, which is the fir&s;t great Mover of the publick Manners, being in this Condi|tion, the latter mu&s;t needs be in a deplorable State.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="20">
have made &s;uch a di&s;mal Havock in ours, that we have hardly any Remains of tho&s;e of our Fore|fathers. Pride makes our Gentry hate and dete&s;t Solitude, as where they have no Opportunity to &s;et them&s;elves to Show, and drives them from the Country to Crowds and numerous A&s;&s;emblies; where in&s;tead of courting true Glory by Heroick Actions abroad, or by whol&s;ome <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Councils at home, many of them endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves by Parties, and &s;tudy Faction and Divi&s;ion in order to arrive at Power. For to &s;peak freely and impartially, the Per&s;ons who during the&s;e late Years have made mo&s;t Tumult and mo&s;t Stir in the State, &s;ome to a&s;&s;ert the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Authority of the Church, others to &s;ecure equal impartial Liberty to the People; have all, to the Re&s;erve of a very few, under the Shelter of the&s;e &s;pecious Pretexts, contended for their own Power.</P>
<P>Others of our Gentry, who have left their Here|ditary Seats in the Country to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in Town, have endeavour'd to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, and to outvie one another by their foppi&s;h Profu&s;ion, in Eating, Drinking, Dre&s;s, and Equipage; as if Honour were to be acquir'd by &s;haking Hands with Rea&s;on and with Common Sen&s;e. And the more extravagant the Vanity of our modern Fops has been, the more they have thought to grow remarkable by extraordinary Trifles, and the more fond have they been of introducing Novelties. And becau&s;e they them&s;elves have been &s;omething dull of Invention, they have mo&s;t humbly conde&s;cended to borrow from their mortal Enemies, and have valued them&s;elves upon <HI>French</HI> Habits, <HI>French</HI> Di&s;hes, and <HI>French</HI> Dan|ces, as Sir <HI>Martin</HI> does upon his Man's Voice and Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>Since then Publick Spirit flows from the Love of one's Country; and to love one's Country, is to
<PB N="14" REF="21">
love the Manners of it; it is manife&s;t, that we can have very little publick Spirit among us; for we have no Manners of our own to love; our Man|ners are tho&s;e of all the neighbouring Nations. And whereas it was formerly a part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wi&s;|dom, whenever they gave to other People the Right of <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens, to oblige them to throw off their old Cu&s;toms, and become conformable to theirs; we at a time of general Naturalization are throwing off the very Remains of our old Cu&s;toms, and embracing tho&s;e of all the Nations whom we de|&s;ign to receive.</P>
<P>Methinks it &s;hould mortify all tho&s;e who pretend to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by introducing &s;uch emp|ty Trifles among us, to con&s;ider what is become of tho&s;e, who were at the Head of the Fa&s;hions and Cu&s;toms thirty Years ago. Are they not as much forgot, nay are they not more, than <HI>Jowler,</HI> and <HI>Rockwood,</HI> and <HI>Ringwood,</HI> that lead the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Fox-hounds then.</P>
<P>But Luxury which began by Pride, grew habitu|al by Length of Time, and was then improv'd by &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures to an amazing Height.</P>
<P>There would be no end of enumerating the &s;eve|ral Wines which we u&s;e to debauch us, or the va|rious Di&s;hes, or their unnatural Mixtures, or their high Aromatick Sauces, tho&s;e fierce Incendiaries of the Blood and Spirits. The <HI>Romans</HI> in the Times of their corrupted Manners equall'd us perhaps in the&s;e: But we are not contented, as they were of old, to rifle the Earth, the Air, and the Sea, to ad|vance our &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures; we have rais'd Recruits from the very Fire, and made e'en that devouring Element, that in the Time of our Fore-fathers con|&s;um'd all, but produc'd nothing, fertile of a thou|&s;and Luxuries; witne&s;s our Brandy, our U&s;que|baugh's, our <HI>Ro&s;a Solis,</HI> our <HI>Ratifia's,</HI> and all the Fa|mily of de&s;tructive Spirits. The&s;e Multitudes of
<PB N="15" REF="22">
People con&s;tantly u&s;e to invigorate them&s;elves, not con&s;idering that Nature vigorous and undebauch'd draws the be&s;t and the noble&s;t Spirits from the &s;im|ple&s;t Liquors, and the be&s;t and the mo&s;t congenial of all from Water: For &s;he, like &s;ome other Me|chanicks, operates be&s;t with her own In&s;truments, and u&s;es but aukwardly tho&s;e of Art.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Spirits are grown as habitual to the Women, as they are to the Men; in who&s;e tender Con&s;titutions they rai&s;e fierce Ebullitions and violent Emotions, too rude for the delicate Texture of their Fibres: And for half the Year together, they nei|ther take any Air, nor u&s;e any Exerci&s;e to remove them. From hence Di&s;tempers of Body and Mind; from hence an Infinity of irregular De&s;ires, unlaw|ful Amours, Intrigues, and Vapours, and Whim|&s;ies, and all the numerous melancholly Crowd of deep hy&s;terical Symptoms; from hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the Fruit of their Bodies lies in them like Plants in hot Beds; from hence it proceeds, that our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Maids, who in the Times of our <HI>Henries</HI> were not held marriageable till turn'd of Twenty, are now become falling ripe at twelve, forc'd to Pre|maturene&s;s by the Heat of adventitious Fire.</P>
<P>Thus has our Luxury chang'd our Natures in de|&s;pight of our Climate, and our Girls are ripe as &s;oon as tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Nor has it only chang'd our Natures, but transform'd our Sexes: We have Men that are more &s;oft, more languid, and more pa&s;&s;ive than Women; Men, who like Women are come to u&s;e Red and White, and part of the Nation are turning <HI>Picts</HI> again. On the other &s;ide we have Women, who as it were in Revenge are Ma&s;culine in their De&s;ires, and Ma&s;culine in their Practices; yes, we have Vices which we dare not name, tho' af|ter the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and to mention which with an open Frankne&s;s, would require the Boldne&s;s of a perfect Saint, or an accompli&s;h'd Li|bertine.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23">
Few Con&s;titutions and fewer E&s;tates are &s;ufficient to &s;uch Luxury: Yet happy were Men, if the want of Money could mortify or &s;ubdue their boundle&s;s De|&s;ires; &s;uch a Victory were cheaply purchas'd at the Expence of Ruin. But the Mi&s;chief is, that when the Habit of Luxury is grown inveterate, Indi|gence does but exa&s;perate De&s;ire, and De&s;ire makes Indigence in&s;upportable. And therefore a Per&s;on who has a Thou&s;and a Year, and who yet cannot live under two or three Thou&s;and, is ten times more unhappy, and has ten times more want than an ho|ne&s;t Beggar, who could live contentedly on twenty: And therefore this latter does only beg, while the other too frequently robs and &s;teals, not indeed from particular Per&s;ons, becau&s;e that cannot be done without Danger of Infamy, or of corporal Puni&s;h|ment, but from the Publick without any Reluctance, where tho' perhaps the Danger to him&s;elf may be a thou&s;and times le&s;s, the Guilt and the Mi&s;chief are a thou&s;and times greater. Thus private Lu&s;ts are too often &s;upported by publick Frauds and Rapines; and the &s;upporting of the&s;e makes him, who be|fore he con&s;um'd his E&s;tate, retain'd his Honour and his Integrity, fraudulent, venal, rapacious, cruel, oppre&s;&s;ive; this makes him rack and grind his Tenants, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s his in&s;olvent Deb|tors, &s;eizing at once upon Body and Goods, to the irrecoverable Ruin of them&s;elves and their Fami|lies, without Compa&s;&s;ion or Con&s;ideration of their deplorable and inevitable Misfortunes. And this Inhumanity perhaps is &s;hewn, not to get Money to di&s;charge his lawful Debts, but to &s;atisfy for&s;ooth his Debts of Honour, which by being preferably paid to the other, are chang'd to Debts of Infamy. This &s;ets him upon enclo&s;ing Commons, where buy|ing out the Rights of the rich and powerful, he tramples upon the Necks of the poor and impotent, and throws them out of their ancient Dwellings by
<PB N="17" REF="24">
Violence, while the wretched Inhabitant grows a|bandon'd, helple&s;s, and &s;piritle&s;s, and only fit for Servitude. 'Tis this that obliges him to let out his E&s;tate to Monopolizers, who are capable of advan|cing large Sums to &s;upply his Profu&s;ions; one of which Monopolizers perhaps &s;hall rent two Thou|&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>; all which Land perhaps be|ing graz'd, is manag'd by a few Servants, that for|merly maintain'd no le&s;s than forty Families. And this one Tenant has been known to be a notorious Papi&s;t, who has &s;old his Hereditary E&s;tate, and en|ter'd upon this new Commerce, to avoid the paying of double Taxes, and to elude the Power of the Laws.</P>
<P>'Tis nothing but Want, occa&s;ion'd by Luxury, that has rais'd Gaming to &s;uch a Height, that it has done more Mi&s;chief than a Plague; for the latter on|ly con&s;umes the pre&s;ent People, who&s;e Kind is im|mortal, and therefore mu&s;t &s;pring up again; but the univer&s;al Extravagance of Gaming di&s;orders the very Form and Being of Government, e&s;pecially when 'tis carry'd on with &s;uch a Rage, that neither Sex &s;ets any Bounds to it; but Men and Women, in the Fury of their Pa&s;&s;ion, loo&s;e all Government and all Decorum. The Men forget their Birth, their Rank, their Dignity, their Under&s;tanding, their Virtue, and herd and conver&s;e with mean Wretches, who are often both Fools and Knaves. Men of the fir&s;t Quality keep wor&s;e Company, than Prince <HI>Harry</HI> does in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Play, as a Pick-pocket is more &s;candalous than a High-way-man. 'Tis wonderful to &s;ee People live &s;o much above them&s;elves, and keep Company &s;o much below them&s;elves; to &s;ee &s;o much Pride with &s;o little Subordination.</P>
<P>The Women lock them&s;elves up at Cards whole Days and Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and forget their natu|ral Plea&s;ure of being &s;een, and of being admir'd; and Avarice gets the better of their Pride, as Luxury
<PB N="18" REF="25">
in &s;ome of them had done before; and gets the better of their Plea&s;ure likewi&s;e, gets the better of that Plea&s;ure which is &s;o natural to them, and makes them &s;hew a &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;ion than that which they have for Men. Yet Avarice that drew them from their natural De&s;ires, &s;ometimes brings them back again; and &s;ome of them, like the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> play for their Per&s;ons after they have lo&s;t their Pelf.</P>
<P>While both Sexes are thus tran&s;ported by &s;o fa|tal a Frenzy, where can be any Oeconomy; and without Oeconomy, how few can be good Subjects? Great E&s;tates are often con&s;um'd in a little Time, while Avarice and Profu&s;ion, Pride and Ba&s;ene&s;s walk Hand in Hand together, and Want &s;prings up from the De&s;ire of getting. But by the &s;ame degrees that a Man grows indigent at home, he often grows clamorous and turbulent in the State; for none are more clamorous than they, who under a pretence of publick Good, are &s;triving for Power and Place; and none more eagerly contend for Power, than they who are urg'd by their pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities to make their Markets of the State.</P>
<P>But of all the Fa&s;hions that have been introduc'd among us from abroad, none &s;hews &s;o deplorable a want of Publick Spirit as the <HI>Italian Opera,</HI> and the extravagant Encouragement that upon the account of that, is at the Expence of all that is good and great among us given to worthle&s;s Fools, who can pretend to no Merit but Sound. I had once an In|tention of in&s;erting a long Di&s;cour&s;e of it here, but I have omitted the greater part of it, out of fear of offending &s;ome Per&s;ons, for whom I have conceiv'd a more than ordinary E&s;teem, and who are truly e&s;timable. They have indeed &s;uch good and &s;uch great Qualities, and which &s;hine &s;o truly bright, that they want not the Foil of this &s;en&s;ele&s;s Encou|ragement to &s;et them off to the World. How much

'tis to be lamented, that the Pre&s;&s;ure of their Af|fairs, their Itch of Novelty, and their Pride of &s;hewing their Power at too precious an Expence, diverts them from con&s;idering the Harm which they do both to them&s;elves and the Publick; and from reflecting on that &s;pecious Pretence which they give to their Enemies to call in Que&s;tion their very Wi&s;|dom; that Wi&s;dom which even their Enemies allow to be &s;o con&s;picuous in the re&s;t of their Actions. The Pro&s;perity of the Bad, &s;ay they, and the Suf|ferings of the Good, have made Millions doubt of Providence; when they, who by their Quality, their Rank, or their Fortunes influence and &s;upport the Plea&s;ures of the Town; when the&s;e di&s;courage Me|rit, and encourage Fools, may we not believe, &s;ay they, that they are rather govern'd by Fancy and by Humour than by Rea&s;on?

Manly Plea&s;ures are rational Plea&s;ures; mere &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures are com|mon to Bea&s;ts with Men.

<P>But now, &s;ay they, let us con&s;ider the Manage|ment of the&s;e G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntlemen, who have introduc'd the <HI>Opera</HI> among us, and who have encourag'd it at this extravagant Rate. The introducing of other fo|reign Cu&s;toms among us, proceeded as it were from a Combination of all &s;orts of People; but a few have introduc'd the <HI>Opera,</HI> in De&s;pight and Con|tempt of the re&s;t. If the&s;e Gentlemen love their Country; why do they &s;acrifice its Intere&s;t and Re|putation for a Song? Why do they &s;acrifice the&s;e noble Arts, which may bring Profit and Renown to it, to inglorious ones, which threaten it with Dan|ger and Infamy. What Article has Mu&s;ick in the

<HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Greatne&s;s? What has it in our own? When they have an&s;wer'd them&s;elves, let them give them&s;elves &s;o much Trouble as to look into <HI>Bayle</HI>'s Hi&s;torical Dictionary, which is now &s;pread throughout <HI>Europe:</HI> Let them &s;ee there, how much of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Greatne&s;s is owing to the&s;e no|ble Arts, which they have bani&s;h'd for &s;o wanton a Trifle, that 'tis hardly fit for a Woman's Toy.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Opera</HI> in &s;o &s;hort a time has made the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Wit a Je&s;t, what Security have we that in twenty Years more, it will not make the old <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Courage a Je&s;t likewi&s;e? It has already had that Effect in <HI>Italy,</HI> and perhaps in <HI>France</HI> too in &s;ome de|gree. And nothing is more plain, than that Effe|minacy is much more compatible with Wit, than it is with Courage. Now is not the <HI>Opera,</HI> &s;ay they, an effeminate Trifle? Has it not, where-ever it comes, ema&s;culated the Minds of Men, and corrup|ted their Manners? Has it not made good the Accu|&s;ations of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicero?</HI> Why then, if the&s;e Gentlemen love their Country, do they encourage that which corrupts their Country-men, and makes them degenerate from them&s;elves &s;o much? If they are &s;o fond of the <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ick, why do they not take it from the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> to their Hou&s;es, and hug it like their &s;ecret Sins there? Why do they abu&s;e the Queen's Authority, to enervate and de|banch her People, and to di&s;courage her Subjects, &s;o contrary to her Maje&s;ty's Royal Intention, and the expre&s;s Words of her Licence? Where, &s;ay they, is the Gratitude and Ju&s;tice of preferring Fo|reigners to <HI>Britons,</HI> and in a time of a deplorable War, their Enemies to their Country-men? Is there not an implicit Contract between all the People of every Nation, to e&s;pou&s;e one another's Intere&s;t a|gain&s;t all Foreigners what&s;oever? But would not any one &s;wear to ob&s;erve the Conduct of the&s;e Per|&s;ons, that they were protected by <HI>Italians</HI> in their
<PB N="23" REF="30">
Liberty, their Property, and their Religion again&s;t <HI>Britons?</HI> For why el&s;e &s;hould they prefer <HI>Italian</HI> Sound to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sen&s;e, <HI>Italian</HI> Non&s;en&s;e to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rea&s;on, the Blockheads of <HI>Italy</HI> to their own Coun|try-men, who have Wit; and the Luxury, and Ef|feminacy of the mo&s;t profligate Portion of the Globe to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Virtue? Why do tho&s;e exotick worth|le&s;s Wretches fare deliciou&s;ly every Day, and &s;leep in Purple at Night, while our own Proficients in more generous Arts, of Arts which alone can wor|thily celebrate the Glories of our Country, and the Triumphs of the Queen's victorious Reign, are &s;uf|fer'd to be reduc'd to the ba&s;e&s;t Want? A Play, &s;ay they, is the Imitation of human Life, in order to its Improvement; and yet that is an Art which is about to be lo&s;t among us. But what is an <HI>Opera?</HI> 'Tis &s;o fooli&s;h a thing, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give a &s;erious De&s;cription of it: 'Tis the Imitation, or rather the Burle&s;que of Catterwawling, where Love and Battle are wag'd together with a perpetual Squawling. And yet this is the thing that is &s;o much encourag'd. O noble Encouragement! What, &s;ay they, can they an&s;wer to this, but that they are pleas'd with the <HI>Opera,</HI> and that they are re&s;olv'd to &s;acrifice all things to their own Plea&s;ure even the Honour and Intere&s;t of their Country? Now can any thing in the World &s;hew a more deplorable want of Publick Spirit than this? Tho' there was little of it in the Nation before, yet many People &s;hew'd &s;o much E&s;teem for it, at lea&s;t to pretend to it: But the&s;e Per&s;ons by &s;uch a Declaration mani|fe&s;tly boa&s;t of the want of it; they boldly confe&s;s, that they are not concern'd for the Intere&s;t and Ho|nour of their Country, and &s;o prevail upon all tho&s;e who can be influenc'd by their Example to throw off any Concern for it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="31">
I am &s;orry that the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould have gi|ven their Enemies the &s;pecious Pretexts to make Ob|jections like the&s;e: I can only &s;ay in Defence of &s;ome of them what is known to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that not only the Services which they have done the Common Cau&s;e have been mo&s;t con&s;picuous, and mo&s;t illu|&s;trious; but that they appear'd &s;o early in the De|fence of their Country, and at a time, when they had nothing but Ruin to expect from their Zeal, that it was undeniably their Love to their Coun|try, and not their Intere&s;t, which engag'd them in the Defence of it. This I can &s;ay in the Behalf of three or four E&s;pou&s;ers of the <HI>Opera</HI>; and I could wi&s;h the few de&s;erving re&s;t would apologize for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But for the numerous Herd of its Encouragers, who have not the lea&s;t Pretence to Merit, I would not have them think that any part of the preceding Di&s;cour&s;e is addre&s;t to them. They are Per&s;ons whom 'tis very ea&s;y to contemn, but very hard to &s;atisfy, and lea&s;t of all with Rea&s;on. 'Tis their Intere&s;t that the reigning Diver&s;ion of the Town &s;hould be that, of which they are often better qua|lified to judge, than they are who have Under&s;tand|ing: They are not only pleas'd with the <HI>Opera</HI> for&s;ooth, they value them&s;elves upon it, as their Brother Sir <HI>Martin</HI> did upon his Man's Voice and Mu&s;ick. If they were the only Per&s;ons concern'd, I believe no one would give him&s;elf a Moment's trou|ble to put them out of Conceit with them&s;elves, and with their darling Bawble. A Rattle of one &s;ort or other is as nece&s;&s;ary to keep Fools in Order, as it is Children. And therefore let them e'en go on to be us'd as they have been, that is, like &s;o ma|ny <HI>Bartlemew Cockes's,</HI> to have the Eunuchs tickle their Ears with a Straw, while they pick their Pockets.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32">
The Ladies, with humble&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion, &s;eem to mi&s;take their Intere&s;t a little in encouraging <HI>Opera's</HI>; for the more the Men are enervated and ema&s;culated by the Softne&s;s of the <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ick, the le&s;s will they care for them, and the more for one another. There are &s;ome certain Plea&s;ures which are mortal Enemies to their Plea&s;ures, that pa&s;t the <HI>Alps</HI> about the &s;ame time with the <HI>Opera</HI>; and if our Sub&s;crip|tions go on, at the frantick rate that they have done, I make no doubt but we &s;hall come to &s;ee one Beau take another for Better for Wor&s;e, as once an impe|rial harmonious Blockhead did <HI>Sporus.</HI></P>
<P>If any one thinks I have been too &s;evere, let him only con&s;ider, what <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> would have &s;aid, if he had been now alive. He had not the thou&s;andth part of the Provocation that we have, and yet he could not forbear crying out, as it were with a pro|phetick Spirit.</P>

<L>La&s;civious Metres, to who&s;e venom Sound</L>
<L>The open Ears of Youth do always li&s;ten;</L>

<L>Who&s;e Manners &s;till our tardy Api&s;h Nation</L>
<L>Limps after in ba&s;e Imitation.</L></Q>
<P>And thus we have gone through this Draught of the Publick Manners, which is very far from being writ with Malice, or being de&s;ign'd a Libel upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation: He who wrote it, loves his Country too well for that; and if he believes the Manners of our <HI>Britons</HI> corrupt, he believes tho&s;e of &s;ome Southern Nations to be &s;till more degenerate. But they have already lo&s;t their Liberty by their Cor|ruption; ours is yet entire, and in no Danger at pre&s;ent; and it is po&s;&s;ible for us, if we will mend our Manners, to tran&s;mit it to our late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33">
However, if I have either exaggerated any thing, or in &s;ome Particulars have been my &s;elf mi&s;taken, or have been wrongly inform'd by others, I hope the Reader will pardon my Errors for the Sake of my good Intention: For this being a general Satyr, he who wrote it cannot be &s;uppos'd to act by Malice or Pa&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e Satyrs indeed which de&s;cend to mention particular Per&s;ons, under Pretence of re|forming the Publick, often attack tho&s;e particular Per&s;ons, and &s;ometimes the very Mini&s;ters, out of Malice, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Intere&s;t. But no Man can bear Malice again&s;t a Nation, or be angry with a World. He who wrote this is a hearty Lover of his Country; but we have &s;hewn above, that he who loves his Country, loves his Country-men, all his Country-men; for he who pretends to affect a Part only, loves only him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As he who wrote this loves his Country, he will be pleas'd with any Admini&s;tration under which it flouri&s;hes: He is very far from having any rea&s;on to be angry with the Mini&s;ters; nor if he had, would he &s;uffer his Pa&s;&s;ion to get the better of his Rea&s;on, but would let his private Re&s;entment be lo&s;t in the publick Tranquillity, and his private Sufferings in the Happine&s;s of his Country.</P>
<P>Nor are here any bitter envenom'd Reflections upon private particular Per&s;ons, to ruin their Re|putations, and undermine their Intere&s;ts. He who writes this, looks upon him&s;elf as one, who has nei|ther Mi&s;&s;ion nor Authority to expo&s;e any one to pub|lick Cen&s;ure; nor can any thing excu&s;e the doing it, but a Certainty, that the Publick will &s;uffer if it is not done.</P>
<P>As this is a general Satyr, and cannot be the ef|fect either of Pa&s;&s;ion or Malice, a general Benefit mu&s;t be the chief De&s;ign of it. The Good which it carries with it, is equally intended to all; even tho&s;e who happen to be hit by it, are de&s;ign'd to
<PB N="27" REF="34">
be oblig'd among the re&s;t, and &s;uffer only by Ac|cident.</P>
<P>And 'tis for this very Rea&s;on that a general Satyr is preferable to what is particular, not only becau&s;e the De&s;ign is more generous, of obliging all, and offending none, but becau&s;e there is a greater pro|bability of its attaining the End to which it directs its Aim, which is the Reformation of the Reader: For the Plea&s;ure which we find that the Generality of Mankind takes in particular Satyr, is a certain Sign that the Publick reaps little Benefit from it; for few are willing to apply tho&s;e Faults to them|&s;elves, for which they &s;ee any particular Per&s;on ex|pos'd to Contempt and Infamy. Men will more willingly acknowledge Faults, in the committing which they are join'd with Company &s;ufficient to keep them in Countenance.</P>
<P>Yet are particular Satyrs, if they are ju&s;t Satyrs, preferable by much to Lampoons or Libels: That only can be call'd a ju&s;t Satyr, who&s;e Cen&s;ures are always true; but that which endeavours to decry true Merit, out of Malice, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Intere&s;t, is in &s;pight of popular Applau&s;e a Lampoon, and an in|famous Libel.</P>
<P>Yet &s;everal Lampoons, both in Ver&s;e and in Pro&s;e, are writ with Wit and Art; and the&s;e are much better than tho&s;e thou&s;and <HI>Extempore</HI> ones, which are hourly utter'd by Club and Coffee-Hou&s;e Gen|tlemen, <HI>Petty Merchants of &s;mall Conceits,</HI> as my late Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> calls them; <HI>who,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are always aiming at Wit, and generally make fal&s;e Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' perhaps no one is more truly pleas'd by the Charms of a beautiful Imagination than my &s;elf, yet I have always been of Opinion, that there is no one Quality of a human Mind, that makes a Man a more impertinent extravagant Blockhead, than that which they call Wit, when 'tis not corrected by
<PB N="28" REF="35">
good Sen&s;e, and re&s;train'd by Judgment, as a Do&s;e of Mercury uncorrected and unfix'd naturally cau|&s;es Driveling. And that which they call Wit in Conver&s;ation without good Sen&s;e, and without Judg|ment, is generally without good Nature likewi&s;e, and vents it &s;elf in Slander.</P>
<P>Slander is a Vice which is mightily in vogue at pre&s;ent; a &s;purious Brat begot by Pride upon Ma|lice, &s;o lu&s;ty and vigorous a Ba&s;tard, that it often thrives by the &s;ame means which are us'd to de|&s;troy it.</P>
<P>As 'tis begot clande&s;tinely, 'tis nurs'd for a time as &s;ecretly, till it comes at la&s;t to be openly main|tain'd by the Pari&s;h. 'Tis a Creature, of which they who begot it are afraid or a&s;ham'd, while they who maintain it are both proud and fond of it, till like the young Cuckow brought up by the Hedge-Sparrow, it comes to prey on its Fo&s;ter-Father.</P>
<P>'Tis the univer&s;al Corruption of Manners that makes this Vice &s;o current: 'Tis that which re|commends pitiful vile Mechanicks to Per&s;ons of Rank and Quality; recommends even Wretches, who have no Accompli&s;hment either of Art or Na|ture, and who are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by nothing but their being univer&s;al Tale-bearers, and publick Scaven|gers of Scandal.</P>
<Q>Si nous n' avions pas des defauts, nous ne trouve|rions pas tant de paine, &aacute; en trouver dans les autres.</Q>
<Q>If we were without Faults our &s;elves, we &s;hould not take &s;o much Pains as we do to find others out in them.</Q>
<P><PB N="29" REF="36">
For as Stocks are jobb'd by People in the City, who have no real Stock but their Impudence; &s;o Slander is chiefly carry'd on in the Suburbs by Peo|ple, who have no Reputation them&s;elves, and never can have any; by Wretches, who are not only below Fame but Infamy; by tho&s;e, who will no more be remembred three Days after they are dead, than Flies of the la&s;t Sea&s;on: And as, if a De&s;ign were &s;et on foot for levelling E&s;tates, all the Beg|gars in the Nation would come the &s;oone&s;t into it, and be the deepe&s;t concern'd in it; &s;o in this Project for levelling Reputations, the Scum and Off|&s;couring of things is mo&s;t deeply engag'd.</P>
<P>To degrade Merit is their principal Aim; for we have a kind of O&s;traci&s;m for Reputations e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by implicit Con&s;ent among us; and nothing is more dangerous than to be too de&s;erving; and no De&s;ert is become more unpardonable, than that of the Man who does great Services to the Publick. So that a <HI>Briton</HI> who does great and publick Actions, mu&s;t have a more than <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit: For <HI>Romans,</HI> who acted for the Good of their Country, recom|mended them&s;elves to <HI>Romans</HI>; but <HI>Britons,</HI> who have done mo&s;t for the Good of their Country have made thou&s;ands of their Country-men their irrecon|cileable Enemies.</P>
<P>This Vice is chiefly carry'd on by Wretches, who are &s;o worthle&s;s and &s;o thoughtle&s;s, that they have neither Sen&s;e nor Thought to con&s;ider, that to bark at Objects &s;ublime and illu&s;trious, is the Quality of a Dog and a Slanderer; that to call a Man Knave or Fool makes him neither, but if he is neither, it makes him who calls him &s;o mo&s;t emphatically one or the other. That Slander is grown &s;o fa&s;hionable and &s;o frequent, that it does not always hurt the Slander'd, but that in the Opinion of a Man of com|mon Sen&s;e it always hurts the Slanderer; that it can only be the Intere&s;t of Men, who want common
<PB N="30" REF="37">
Hone&s;ty, and of &s;uch who &s;eem to be &s;ent into the World on purpo&s;e to be the Tools of the&s;e; but that 'tis the undoubted Intere&s;t of all Men of Honour and of Merit to defend the Slander'd.</P>
<P>That he who &s;landers any one wants not only common Hone&s;ty, but even common Courage: The fir&s;t, becau&s;e he condemns a Man whom he does not know to be guilty; the &s;econd, becau&s;e he ba&s;ely murders a Man's Reputation behind his Back, when 'tis not in his Power to defend him&s;elf. If a Judge &s;hould condemn any one to die, without po|&s;itive Proof or mo&s;t convincing Pre&s;umption, and e&s;pecially without hearing him, what a dreadful Out-cry would that formal Murder occa&s;ion? How dete&s;table then are they, who upon the mo&s;t frivo|lous Appearances condemn and execute as far as in them lies, the Reputations of their deare&s;t Friends and Acquaintance; tho&s;e Reputations, which are dearer to every good Man, even than Life it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus much to the Men, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to carry on &s;o odious a Vice. I am &s;orry that 'tis requi&s;ite to &s;ay a Word to the Women; who by be|ing in&s;trumental in carrying on this Vice again&s;t the Men, have often given too provoking Occa&s;ions for terrible Retalations. Now Slander bears infi|nitely more hard upon a Woman, than it can do upon a Man; for a Man may retrieve the Reputa|tion of his Courage, his Ju&s;tice, his Honour, or his E&s;tate; but a Woman may as &s;oon recover her lo&s;t Maiden-head as her lo&s;t Reputation.</P>
<P>In fine, as the Foundation both of inventing and of &s;preading Slander, is in the corrupted Manners of him who invents or propagates it; it follows that Slander being now almo&s;t univer&s;al, and raging in all its Height, the Corruption of Manners mu&s;t be likewi&s;e almo&s;t univer&s;al, and at its greate&s;t Height.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38">
Thus have we endeavour'd to lay before the Rea|der a Draught of the Manners of the&s;e Times, and to place it in as true a Light as we could, that the Reader being convinc'd that Publick Spirit depends upon the Publick Manners, and that we have lo&s;t the Manners of our Ance&s;tors without making choice of any others peculiar to us, and that we have in|troduc'd into this I&s;land all manner of foreign Cu|&s;toms and foreign Luxury, may likewi&s;e be &s;atis|fied that there is very little publick Spirit among us.</P>
