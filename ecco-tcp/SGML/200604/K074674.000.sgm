<HEAD>PREFATORY ADDRESS

<P>SOLICITOUS as the public are to have
a perfect copy of the mo&s;t eloquent
&s;peech that was ever delivered in Parlia|ment,
their wi&s;hes mu&s;t be in a great mea|&s;ure
di&s;appointed from the very liberal de|termination
of <HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> to give no
kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in reporting it publickly;
a determination that does as much honour
to his humanity, as his Oration does to his
abilities.&mdash;Having called forth his won|derful
talents whil&s;t in the double office of
a &s;enator, and an accu&s;er of the great de|linquent,
he now &s;inks the apparent, tho' ju&s;t
&s;everity of the <HI>public character,</HI> in the hu|mane
&s;en&s;ibility of the <HI>private individual;</HI>
and generou&s;ly withholds that torrent of
eloquence which mu&s;t excite in every brea&s;t
&s;entiments of indignation again&s;t the atrocity
which demanded it to flow.&mdash;The intention
of this publication is not to excite tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ations
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the noble-minded &s;peaker wi&s;hes to
&s;uppre&s;s; it is not to hold forth the charac|ter
of an Ea&s;tern &s;poiler, for "&s;corn to point
the finger at;" &mdash;it is meant to commemo|rate
the virtues of a patriot mind, vindicating
the honor of his country, and pleading the
cau&s;e of humanity; and, as near as is in the
power of recollection, to pre&s;erve to the
public eye, partially at lea&s;t, one of the mo&s;t
complete pieces of Oratory that ever graced
an Engli&s;h, or any other Senate.</P>
<P>In doing this, the Reporter frankly con|fe&s;&s;es
the fallibility of the means&mdash;all that
he can boa&s;t is, to have come as near the ori|ginal
as the remini&s;cent faculties of a per&s;on
habituated to parliamentary bu&s;ine&s;s, would
permit. How far they have &s;ucceeded, tho&s;e
who had the felicity of being pre&s;ent, are

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH,
<DATE>FEBRUARY 7, 1787,</DATE>
ON THE
Fourth Charge again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings:</HEAD>
<OPENER>IN a Committee <HI>of the whole Hou&s;e, Mr. St.
John</HI> in the chair.</OPENER>
<P><HI>Mr. Demp&s;ter</HI> having communicated to the
hou&s;e, that a paper, which he held in his
hand, had been received by him from Sir Eli|jah
Impey, with a reque&s;t that he would read
it; as it was explanatory of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages
which he had given in evidence at the bar of
the Hou&s;e, but which explanation the Hou&s;e
did not think proper to receive, but from the
mouth of Sir Elijah Impey him&s;elf, and he not
being pre&s;ent, Mr. SHERIDAN was called
upon.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> during a &s;peech which la&s;ted
near five hours and three quarters, command|ed
the mo&s;t profound attention and admira|tion
of the Hou&s;e. His matchle&s;s oration
united the mo&s;t &s;olid argument with the
mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence. His &s;ound rea|&s;oning
giving additional energy to truth, and
his logical per&s;picuity, and unerring judgment,
throwing a light upon, and pervading the ob|&s;curity,
of the mo&s;t involved and compli|cated
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan's pre-eminence and unrivalled
abilities, will, from this period, &s;tand record|ed,
as having had power to a&s;&s;imilate the
mo&s;t di&s;cordant &s;entiments, upon a great and
trying occa&s;ion, and (with a few exceptions,)
to unite the various opinions of the multitude in
one point.&mdash;He commenced his elegant &s;peech
by &s;aying, that had it been po&s;&s;ible to have
received, without the violation of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
rules of Parliament, the paper which the
Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Demp&s;ter) had
ju&s;t now read, he &s;hould willingly have re|ceded
from any forms of the Hou&s;e, for the
purpo&s;e of obtaining farther illu&s;tration of the
&s;ubject then before them: yet he had not
come &s;o ill prepared, as, by a trifling circum|&s;tance,
to be prevented from proceeding to the
<PB N="3" REF="6">
di&s;charge of his duty, or that the want of it
could make any impre&s;&s;ion on the body of
proof he was to bring forward that day a|gain&s;t
Warren Ha&s;tings.</P>
<P>In his opinion, the explanation of the evi|dence,
&s;o far from throwing any new light upon
it and clearing it up, rendered it even more
ob&s;cure and contradictory than before. Every
art was made u&s;e of to impre&s;s the Hou&s;e
with an idea that this bu&s;ine&s;s was not of the
mo&s;t &s;erious nature. But this was far beneath
his notice. The ju&s;tice and &s;trength of his
cau&s;e were not to be overcome by &s;uch pitiful
and flim&s;ey expedients; nor &s;hould he wa&s;te
his time in oppo&s;ing mea&s;ures which were as
paltry and inefficacious, as they were in&s;i|dious.</P>
<P>He would not, he &s;aid, encroach upon the
time of the committee with any general argn|ments
to prove, what was in it&s;elf &s;o obvious,
that the &s;ubject of the charge, which it fell to
his lot to bring forward, was of great magni|tude.
The attention Parliament had be&s;towed
upon Indian concerns for many &s;e&s;&s;ions pa&s;t;
the voluminous productions of their commit|tees
on that &s;ubject, the various proceedings
in that Hou&s;e re&s;pecting it, their own &s;trong
<PB N="4" REF="7">
and pointed re&s;olutions, the repeated recom|mendations
of his Maje&s;ty, and their repeated
a&s;&s;urances of paying due regard to tho&s;e re|commendations,
as well as various acts of
the legi&s;lature, were, all of them, undeniable
proofs of the moment and magnitude of the
con&s;ideration, and tended to e&s;tabli&s;h this
broad fact, that they acknowledged the Bri|ti&s;h
name and character to have been di&s;ho|noured
and dete&s;ted throughout India, by
the malver&s;ation and crimes of the &s;er|vants
of the Ea&s;t India Company. That fact
having been e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond all que&s;tion,
by them&s;elves and their own acts, there need|ed
no argument, on his part, to induce the
committee to &s;ee the importance of the &s;ubject
about to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed that day, in a more &s;trik|ing
point of view than they had them&s;elves
placed it in.</P>
<P>There were, he knew, per&s;ons, without
doors, who affected to ridicule the idea of
pro&s;ecuting Mr. Ha&s;tings, and, in proportion
as the pro&s;ecution became more &s;erious, to in|crea&s;e
their &s;arca&s;ms upon the &s;ubject, by a&s;|&s;erting
that Parliament might be more u&s;efully
employed; that there were matters of more
immediate moment to engage their attention;
that a Commercial Treaty with France had
<PB N="5" REF="8">
ju&s;t been concluded, and that it was an object
of a va&s;t comprehen&s;ive nature, and was of it|&s;elf
&s;ufficient to engro&s;s their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To all this he would oppo&s;e the&s;e que&s;tions:
Was Parliament mi&s;pending its time, by en|quiring
into the oppre&s;&s;ions practi&s;ed on mil|lions
of unfortunate per&s;ons in India, and en|deavouring
to bring the daring delinquents,
who had been guilty of the mo&s;t flagrant acts
of enormous tyranny and rapacious pecula|tion,
to exemplary and condign puni&s;hment?
Was it improperly employed in giving an e|minent
but &s;evere example to their future &s;er|vants,
of the madne&s;s and folly of relying on
corruption and &s;ycophancy for &s;upport, in the
day of trial for their crimes? Was it a mi&s;u&s;e
of their functions, to be dilligent in attempting,
by the mo&s;t effectual means, to wipe off the
di&s;grace that &s;tood affixed to the Briti&s;h name
in India, and to re&s;cue the national character
from la&s;ting infamy? Were the good faith
and credit of Britain of no con&s;equence in
the eyes of the repre&s;entatives of the nation?
Surely no man who felt for either the one or
the other, would think that a bu&s;ine&s;s of greater
moment or magnitude could occupy his at|tention,
or that the Hou&s;e could with too much
&s;teadine&s;s, too ardent a zeal, or too indu&s;trious
<PB N="6" REF="9">
a per&s;everance, pur&s;ue its object. Indeed they
mu&s;t all know and feel the nece&s;&s;ity of bring|ing
this important ca&s;e to the i&s;&s;ue now in|tended.
Their conduct in this re&s;pect la&s;t
year had done them immortal honour, and
proved to all the world, that, however dege|nerate
an example of the conduct of Engli&s;h|men,
&s;ome of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects had exhibited
in India, the people of England collectively,
&s;peaking and acting by their repre&s;entatives,
felt as men &s;hould feel on &s;uch an oeca&s;ion;
that they were anxious to do ju&s;tice, by redre&s;|&s;ing
injuries and puni&s;hing offenders, however
high their rank, however elevated their &s;tation.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan &s;aid he would exhibit to their
view a body of information, which would prove
the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t horrid crimes ever
conceived by the foule&s;t heart that ever inha|bited
a human frame; facts which per&s;ons
of every party, of every political bias in this
kingdom, had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting in bringing to
view. In the&s;e had the indefatigable attention
and labour of &s;everal committees been employ|ed;
it was the work of many years: the&s;e were
fully demon&s;trated in the various clear and
elaborate reports which had been long upon
their table; their long and intere&s;ting de|bates,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
their &s;olemn addre&s;s to the throne, and
their rigorous legi&s;lative acts.</P>
<P>The vote of the Hou&s;e la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, wherein the
conduct of this pillar of India, this corner &s;tone
of our &s;trength in the ea&s;t, this talli&s;man of
the Briti&s;h dominions in A&s;ia, was cen&s;ured,
did the greate&s;t honour to that hou&s;e, as it
mu&s;t be the fore-runner of &s;peedy ju&s;tice on
<HI>that character</HI> which was &s;aid to be above cen|&s;ure,
and who&s;e conduct, we were given to
under&s;tand, was above &s;u&s;picion, His deeds
were &s;uch, they could not be ju&s;tified by any
po&s;&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity; for no &s;ituation, however
elevated, however embarra&s;&s;ed, could ju&s;tify a
man for committing acts of rapacity upon in|dividuals.
To the honour of that Hou&s;e, they
had re&s;i&s;ted the mon&s;trous argument attempted
to be &s;et up, they had &s;hewn their dete&s;tation
of that novel and ba&s;e &s;ceptici&s;m on the prin|ciples
of judicial enquiry, con&s;tantly the lan|guage
of the Governor General's <HI>&s;ervile de|pendents;</HI>
that &s;uch horrid crimes &s;hould be
compounded; that, though <HI>M. Ha&s;tings</HI> might
be guilty of all the charges exhibited again&s;t
him, he ought not to be puni&s;hed; he &s;hould
&s;till be con&s;idered as the <HI>&s;aviour of India,</HI> and
that fortunate events were a full and complete
fet-off again&s;t a &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion, corrup|tion,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
breach of faith, peculation and treachery.
What though King, Lords, and Commons,
were again&s;t him, he was not a per&s;on to be
a&s;&s;ailed; for he had a vote of thanks from the
Court of Proprietors in his pocket. The
committee had, however, nobly combated
&s;uch doctrine, and declared that <HI>Mr. Ha&s;|tings</HI>'s
treatment of <HI>Cheyt Sing</HI> was unju&s;tifi|able
upon any ground of political nece&s;&s;ity.
Their &s;olemn and awful judgment, that in the
ca&s;e of Benares, Mr. Ha&s;tings's conduct was
a proper object of parliamentary impeachment,
had covered them with applau&s;e, and brought
them forward in the face of all the world as
the objects of perpetual admiration. To u&s;e
the words of a Right Honourable Gentleman
(Mr. Pitt) on this &s;ubject, the committee had
found in the admini&s;tration of Mr. Ha&s;tings,
"<HI>Acts of &s;trong inju&s;tice, of grinding oppre&s;&s;ion, and
nnprovoked &s;everity.</HI>" That committee had al&s;o
re&s;cued his Right Honourable Friend (Mr.
Burke) from the imputation of being a fal&s;e ac|cu&s;er,
they had &s;hewn that he was not moved by
envy, by malice, nor any unworthy motives to
blacken a &s;potle&s;s name; they had approved him
to be, what in reality he was, an indefatigable,
and, he was happy to add, a &s;ucce&s;sful, cham|pion
in the cau&s;e of truth, humanity, and ju&s;|tice.
With &s;ound judgment, with manly firm|ne&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="12">
with un&s;haken integrity, had his Right
Honourable Friend re&s;i&s;ted the timid policy
of mere <HI>remedial</HI> acts. Even the high opinion
of Mr. Ha&s;tings's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, even the admitted
worth of Lord Cornwallis's character, had
been deemed by him an inadequate atonement
to India for the injuries &s;o heavily inflicted on
her. The committee had by their vote &s;o|lemnly
pledged them&s;elves to India. They
had audibly &s;aid to the inhabitants of that
country; There &s;hall be no more <HI>remedial</HI> acts:
You &s;hall no longer be &s;educed into temporary
acquie&s;cence, by &s;ending out a titled governor,
or a vapouring &s;et of re&s;olutions; It is not with
&s;tars and ribbands, and all the badges of regal
favour, that weatone to you for pa&s;t delinquen|cies,
the&s;e &s;hould bend to the &s;acred &s;hrine of
ju&s;tice, and the people of India &s;hall be con|vinced
of our hone&s;t intentions. You &s;hall
have the &s;olid con&s;olation of &s;eeing an end to
your grievances, by an example of puni&s;hment
for pa&s;t offences. The Hou&s;e has &s;et up a bea|con,
which, while it &s;erved as a guide to
them&s;elves, would al&s;o make their motions
more con&s;picuous to the world that &s;urrounded
and beheld them. He had no doubt of their
manly determination to go through the whole
of the bu&s;ine&s;s, with the &s;ame &s;teadine&s;s which
<PB N="10" REF="13">
gave &s;uch &s;terling brilliancy of character to
their out&s;et, and that they might &s;afely chal|lenge
the world, to ob&s;erve and judge of them
by the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>After an exordium of this tendency, Mr.
Sheridan took notice of a paper, &s;igned "War|ren
Ha&s;tings," which had been put into his
hand, as he entered the hou&s;e that day, and
which he con&s;idered as a &s;econd defence, and a
&s;econd an&s;wer to the charge he was about to
bring forward; a charge, replete with proof of
criminality of the blacke&s;t die, of tyranny the
mo&s;t ba&s;e and unprecedented, of treachery the
mo&s;t vile and premeditated, of corruption the
mo&s;t open and &s;hamele&s;s, of oppre&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t
grinding and &s;evere, and cruelty the mo&s;t un|manly
and unparalleled.</P>
<P>There never was a que&s;tion &s;ince the creation
of the world, wherein &s;o much cruelty, wicked|ne&s;s,
inhumanity and depravity, were put to
the te&s;t, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. He was no
party accu&s;er: <Q>I call, &s;aid Mr. Sheridan,
upon his advocates to watch my words, and
to take them down. I will exhibit no charge
that has not &s;olid truth for its foundation, for
I tru&s;t nothing to declamation.</Q> Mr. She|ridan
<PB N="11" REF="14">
added; he was far from meaning to re&s;t
the charge on a&s;&s;ertion, or on any warm ex|pre&s;&s;ions
that the impul&s;e of wounded feelings
might produce: He would e&s;tabli&s;h every part
of the charge, by the mo&s;t unan&s;werable proof,
and the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable evidence; the
witne&s;s, whom he would bring forth to &s;upport
every fact he intended to &s;tate, &s;hould be, for the
mo&s;t part, a witne&s;s that no man would venture
to contradict; no other than <HI>Warren Ha&s;tings</HI>
himfelf!</P>
<P>And yet &s;uch a character had friends&mdash;he
blamed them not&mdash;they might po&s;&s;ibly conclude
him innocent;&mdash;becau&s;e he him&s;elf a&s;&s;erted it
was &s;o.</P>
<P>The defence of Mr. Ha&s;tings would e&s;tabli&s;h
every charge he had to make again&s;t him.
There was not one fact which was not founded
on, or mixed with fal&s;ehood; no one que&s;tion
that was truly given; nor one &s;ingle conclu&s;ion
which followed fairly from the premi&s;es laid
down: but of this a&s;&s;ertion, the multiplied proofs
would &s;hortly ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan &s;aid he would go farther back
into a detail of facts than his Right Honourable
<PB N="12" REF="15">
friend had done in his charge, in order the
more clearly to &s;hew the committee the &s;ituation
in which the Briti&s;h government of India &s;tood
with re&s;pect to the Nabob of Oude and the Be|gums,
till the de&s;ign of obliging the Nabob to
plunder tho&s;e unfortunate Prince&s;&s;es (his mother
and grandmother) of their trea&s;ures, to confi&s;|cate
their Jaghires and &s;eize upon the mini&s;ters,
throw them into a dungeon, there load them
with chains, and keep them for many months
clo&s;e pri&s;oners, &s;uffering incredible hard&s;hips,
was fir&s;t entertained by the Governor General.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan here read a variety of extracts
from Mr. Ha&s;tings's defence; wherein were
&s;tated the various &s;teps taken by Mr. <HI>Bri&s;tow,</HI>
(the Company's Re&s;ident at Fyzyabad,) in the
years 1775 and 1776, to procure aid for the Na|bob,
from the Begum, (the dowager prince&s;&s;es of
that di&s;trict,) and that he thought proper to
exact, by his &s;ole authority, thirty lacks of ru|pees,
for the u&s;e of the Nabob Vizier of Oude,
out of the trea&s;ures bequeathed to the Begum
by her late hu&s;band Sujah Dowla; obtaining
however the guarantee of the Governor and
Council that, that exaction, for which no &s;ha|dow
of right was &s;hewn, &s;hould be the la&s;t. Mr.
Ha&s;tings, however, had not &s;tated one of the
<PB N="13" REF="16">
facts truly. Groundle&s;s, nugatory and in&s;ult|ing
were his affirmations, that the &s;eizure of
trea&s;ures from the Begums, and the expo&s;ition
of their pilfered goods to public auction, (un|parallelled
acts of open inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion and
inhumanity) were in any degree to be defended
by tho&s;e incroachments on their property, which
had taken place previous to his admini&s;tration,
or by tho&s;e &s;ales which they them&s;elves had &s;o|licited,
as a favourable mode of their &s;upplying
a part of their aid to the Nabob. The re|lation
of a &s;eries of plain indi&s;putable facts, would
irrecoverably overthrow a &s;ubterfuge &s;o pitiful, a
di&s;tinction &s;o ridiculous. It mu&s;t be remem|bered
that, at that period, the Begums did not
<HI>merely de&s;ire,</HI> but they mo&s;t <HI>expre&s;ly &s;tipulated,</HI>
that of the thirty lacks promi&s;ed, eleven &s;hould
be paid in &s;undry articles of manufacture. Was
it not obvious therefore, that the &s;ale of goods
in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, far from partaking of the na|ture
of an act of plunder, became an exten&s;ion
of relief, of indulgence, and of accommodation.
By the pa&s;&s;ages which he &s;hould beg leave to
read, <HI>Mr. Ha&s;tings</HI> wi&s;hed to in&s;inuate that a
claim was &s;et up to the Begum's trea&s;ure, as
belonging of right to the Nabob. In this
tran&s;action Mr. Ha&s;tings endeavoured to &s;hift
the re&s;pon&s;ibility from him&s;elf to the majority
<PB N="14" REF="17">
of the Council, and under that authority to keep
alive the Nabob's right.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, in order to prove the op|pre&s;&s;ion
of the Prince&s;&s;es in 1775, which
was much aggravated in 1781, read an extract
of a letter from the Bhow Begum, mother
of the Nabob, to Mr. Ha&s;tings, received at
Calcutta December 22, 1775, wherein &s;he &s;ays,
<Q>If it is <HI>your plea&s;ure</HI> that the mother of the
late Nabob, my&s;elf, and his other women,
and infant children, &s;hould be reduced to a
&s;tate of di&s;honour and di&s;tre&s;s, we <HI>mu&s;t &s;ubmit;</HI>
but if, on the contrary, you call to mind the
friend&s;hip of the late ble&s;&s;ed Nabob, you will
exert your&s;elf effectually in favour of us, who
are helple&s;s.</Q> And again, <Q>If you do not
approve of my remaining at Fyzyabad, &s;end
a per&s;on here, in your name, to remove the
mother of the late Nabob, my&s;elf, and about
2000 women and children, that we may re|&s;ide
with honour and reputation in &s;ome other
place.</Q> This letter and &s;everal others were
read, to prove the controuling power of Mr.
Ha&s;tings in Oude, at &s;o late a period as before
mentioned; and to prove that every circum|&s;tance
of oppre&s;sion and exaction, practi&s;ed on
the&s;e Prince&s;&s;es, was done by the orders, con|&s;ent,
<PB N="15" REF="18">
and approbation, of the Governor, who
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be paramount in Oude.</P>
<P><HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> which was the true &s;ource of all
the cruelties, was the original pretence which
Mr. Ha&s;tings made to the Company for the
mea&s;ure; and through the whole of his conduct
he makes Mahomedani&s;m an excu&s;e; as if he
meant to in&s;inuate, that there was &s;omething in
Mahomedani&s;m which made it impious in a
&s;on, not to plunder his mother. But, to &s;hew
how the que&s;tion preci&s;ely &s;tood when Mr.
Ha&s;tings begun the attack, Mr. Sheridan read
the Minutes of General Clavering, Colonel
Mon&s;on, and Mr. Francis, who &s;everally &s;poke
of a claim which had been made by the Nabob
on the Bhow Begum, in the year 1775, amount|ing
to two and a half lacks. The opinion con|tained
in tho&s;e minutes was, that women were,
on the death of their hu&s;bands, entitled by the
Mahomedan law, only to the property within
the Zenana where they lived. This opinion
was deci&s;ive. Mr. Bri&s;tow u&s;ed no threats; no
military execution or rigor was even menaced
the Begums complied with the requi&s;ition then
made, and the di&s;puted property then claimed
was given up.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">
After this, the farther trea&s;ure that was
within the Zenana, was confe&s;&s;edly her own.
No farther right was &s;et up, no pretence of any
kind was advanced, to claim the re&s;idue. Nay,
a treaty was &s;igned by the Nabob, and ratified,
by the Re&s;ident, Mr. Bri&s;tow that, on her
paying thirty lacks, &s;he &s;hould be freed from
all farther applications; and the Company were
bound, by Mr. Bri&s;tow, to guarantee this treaty.
Here then was the i&s;&s;ue. After this treaty thus
ratified, could there be an argument as to the
right of the trea&s;ures of the Begums? If the
Mahomedan law had given a right, was not that
right concluded?</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan averred, that the Mahomedan
law did not authorize the &s;eizure of the Prince&s;&s;es
property; that &s;everal jaghires were left them
by the late Nabob Sujah Doulah for their own
maintenance, and the education of their chil|dren;
that the plunder was never authori&s;ed by
the Board; and that military execution being
u&s;ed for the recovery of the exactions, was
contrary to every principle of ju&s;tice; and that
the Nabob complied reluctantly in many in|&s;tances:
that Mr. Bri&s;tow acted under the or|ders
of his immediate &s;uperior: that, when the
whole tran&s;action was cen&s;ured, Mr. Ha&s;tings
then threw off all re&s;pon&s;ibility, and appealed
<PB N="17" REF="20">
pealed to the orders of the Board, at a
time, when he knew the authority of the
Board was ve&s;ted in him&s;elf alone, there
being only one other member; and the
Governor having the ca&s;ting voice, every
act mu&s;t become his own. This, &s;aid
Mr. Sheridan, is &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the
following ca&s;e.&mdash;If, &s;ome five years
hence, I was to become a warm ad|mirer
of Mr. Ha&s;tings's late admini&s;|tration,
and from friend&s;hip, become
his panegyri&s;t; would not &s;ome per&s;on
who hears me now, remind me of my
accu&s;ations again&s;t him, and &s;ay to me,
Why this &s;udden change of opinion?
I could only an&s;wer, that I thought &s;o
then; but &s;ince that time I had changed
my opinion, and that I was not an&s;wer|able
now for what I then did in my
official capacity. What mu&s;t the world
think of &s;uch tergiver&s;ation, of &s;uch
meanne&s;s? Is there any man in this
Hou&s;e that would countenance &s;uch a
nefarious procedure? After a &s;olemn gua|rantee
and a&s;&s;ignment is entered into, thus
to break the public faith, which was
<PB N="18" REF="21">
pledged to pre&s;erve their property, is a
tran&s;action that honor &s;hrinks from. The
Begums were &s;aid to be in the habits of
di&s;turbing the public peace; but there is
no in&s;tance on record of any &s;uch attempt,
until the revolution of Benares; and then
all India &s;eemed to be ho&s;tile to England.</P>
<P>I would here &s;it down, and re&s;t my
que&s;tion of cen&s;ure, on the i&s;&s;ue of what
has been produced; as it mu&s;t be clear to
every member, that the prince&s;&s;es were en|titled
to our protection; and that every
ho&s;tile attempt, to wre&s;t their property
from them, was unju&s;t and di&s;graceful. I
require no other proof for this than Mr.
Ha&s;tings's own words, wherein he &s;ays,
<Q>That our officious interference made
us many foes.</Q></P>
<P>In 1778, we entered into another treaty
with the Nabob, which was negotiated
by Mr. Middleton, wherein it was &s;tipu|lated,
that the Bhow Begum was not to
be mole&s;ted; and, not long after, Mr.
Ha&s;tings tran&s;mits to the Court of Di|rectors
<PB N="19" REF="22">
a di&s;tre&s;sful picture of the &s;itua|tion
of the Nabob, of the horrors and
famine which triumphed over his coun|try.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible for a country to be
&s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, the Nabob's territo|ries
were &s;o in the year 1780; but, at that
period, there was a majority in council,
who&s;e &s;entiments were by no means fa|vourable
to the per&s;ecuting &s;chemes of the
Governor; and, for this rea&s;on, there was
then no offer to mole&s;t the property of
the Begums.</P>
<P>In the &s;ub&s;equent year, however, the
Governor took e&s;pecial care to furni&s;h
him&s;elf with power. The treaty of <HI>Chu|nar</HI>
was executed; and &s;urely a treaty, &s;o
marked with di&s;&s;imulation, was never be|fore
entered into: the Governor made
him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for every political tran|&s;action
in that ravaged and oppre&s;&s;ed
country.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">
Mr. Sheridan &s;aid he had now reached
the period, when Mr. Ha&s;tings's fir&s;t in|tentions
appeared, to enforce the execu|tion
of his projects at all events; when,
by <HI>Mr. Middleton,</HI> his private agent, he
urged the Nabob <HI>A&s;oph ul Dowla,</HI> to
break this &s;olemn engagement, &s;anctioned
by the guarantee of the Company, to de|prive
his mother, and the elder Begum, his
grandmother, of the jaghires which were
a&s;&s;igned for their &s;upport; and proceed|ing
&s;till farther to plunder them of their
trea&s;ures, which he had avowed to be their
&s;ole property, and which he had &s;olemnly
pledged him&s;elf &s;hould remain inviolate.
It was a little difficult, however, here to
&s;ay, what was the que&s;tion at i&s;&s;ue. It
had &s;ometimes been &s;aid, that the Nabob
had an inherent right to this wealth, as
the wealth of the &s;tate; but when it was
recollected that it was not made up of the
produce of taxes, but collected by the
conque&s;ts of his father, Sujah Dowla, by
him bequeathed as a per&s;onal acqui&s;ition,
(prudently for his &s;on,) whom it would
only make the object of rapacious attack,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
and to whom he, with more wi&s;dom, be|queathed
nece&s;&s;ity as his &s;word, and po|verty
as his &s;hield; and when it was con|&s;idered
in what manner, and on what
condition, it was relinqui&s;hed by the Na|bob,
and that dereliction guaranteed by the
Company, he thought that ground of
defence would &s;carcely be occupied on the
pre&s;ent day. Mr. Ha&s;tings in his defence
had taken a more extended field, where
there was more &s;cope for his delu&s;ion,
more amplitude for his equivocation. He
had admitted the right to have re&s;ted in
the Begums, but contended that it had
been forfeited by their frequent acts of
contumacy and rebellion. This allegation
again&s;t them had been divided into four
parts:&mdash;The charges were the following.</P>
<P>1. That they had given di&s;turbances at
all times to the Nabob, and that they had
long manife&s;ted a &s;pirit, ho&s;tile to his and
to the Engli&s;h government:</P>
<P>2. That they excited the Zemindars to
revolt, at the time of the in&s;urrection at
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Benares, and of the re&s;umption of the
Jaghires:</P>
<P>3. That they re&s;i&s;ted by armed force
the re&s;umption of their own Jaghires: and</P>
<P>4. That they excited and were acce&s;|&s;ary
to the in&s;urrection at Benares.</P>
<P>To each of the&s;e charges Mr. Sheridan
made di&s;tinct and &s;eparate an&s;wers, by a va|riety
of extracts which he read; &s;ome of them
written by Mr. Ha&s;tings him&s;elf, to prove
that they had particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> for the En|gli&s;h,
and the various good offices they
had rendered Government. Again&s;t the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> charge <HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> adduced proofs,
in the mo&s;t pointed terms, from the &s;eve|ral
letters which pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Ha&s;|tings
and Mr. Middleton, Colonel Han|nay
and the Nabob. By this corre&s;pon|dence
it was very evident, that their con|duct
during the period from 1775 to 1781,
&s;o far from being what it was repre&s;ented,
had been mild and inoffen&s;ive. Not a
<PB N="23" REF="26">
&s;ingle &s;ymptom of inveteracy, not one
&s;olid proof of di&s;affection, was mentioned
in the&s;e letters, but in all, their conduct
appeared as much the rever&s;e, as it was in
the nature of things to expect. The
<HI>&s;econd</HI> charge fell to the ground the in|&s;tant
it was examined; for, &s;o far from
any undue influence being u&s;ed on the
part of the <HI>Begums,</HI> to &s;timulate the Jag|hirdars
to re&s;i&s;tance, it did not even appear
that the &s;malle&s;t re&s;i&s;tance was made by
the jaghirdars, again&s;t the violences which
they &s;u&s;tained. The third charge was
equally fal&s;e. Did they re&s;i&s;t the re&s;ump|tion
of their own jaghires? Though, if they
had actually re&s;i&s;ted, it could not be deemed
criminal; for tho&s;e jaghires were their own
property, ve&s;ted in them and confirmed
to them by a &s;olemn treaty. But is there,
in fact, one &s;yllable of charge alledged
again&s;t them? With all the load of
obloquy which the Nabob incurred,
had he ever accu&s;ed them of the crime of
re&s;i&s;ting his authority? No; he had not.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">
To prove the fal&s;ehood of the whole of
this charge, and to &s;hew that Mr. Ha&s;tings
originally projected the plunder; that he
threw the Odium in the fir&s;t in&s;tance on
the Nabob; that he imputed the crimes
to them, before he had received one of the
rumours which he afterwards manufac|tured
into affidavits; he recommended a
particular attention to dates; and he de|duced
from the papers the&s;e clear facts&mdash;
that the fir&s;t idea &s;prung from Mr. Ha&s;t|ings,
on the 25th of November, 1781;
that Mr. Middleton communicated it to
the Nabob, and procured from him a for|mal
propo&s;ition on the 2d of December;
That on the 1&s;t of December Mr. Ha&s;tings
wrote a letter to Mr. Middleton, confirm|ing
the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion made through Sir
Elijah, which letter came into the hands
of Mr. Middleton on the 6th of Decem|ber.
He &s;tated all the circum&s;tances of
the pains taken by Mr. Middleton, who
was empowered by Mr. Ha&s;tings to force
the Nabob, on whom all the blame is
laid, and who&s;e act it was, to &s;eize on his
mother's jaghires; and coupled this with
<PB N="25" REF="28">
the extraordinary minute written by Mr.
Ha&s;tings on his return to Calcutta, where
he &s;tated the re&s;i&s;tance of the Begums to
the execution of the re&s;umption on the
7th of January, 1782, as the cau&s;e of the
mea&s;ure in November, 1781. Mr. Mid|dleton
had proved that the Nabob had no
&s;uch intention, for, in writing to Mr.
Ha&s;tings, he &s;ays, <Q>finding the Na|bob
wavering in his determination of
the re&s;umption of the Jaghires, I this
day, (6th Dec. 1781,) in the pre&s;ence of
his Mini&s;ter informed him, that unle&s;s
he would i&s;&s;ue <HI>his</HI> perwannahs for that
purpo&s;e, I would i&s;&s;ue <HI>my</HI> perwannahs.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then took pains to &s;hew,
that the Begums were, by their condition,
their age, their infirmities, &amp;c. almo&s;t the
only two &s;ouls in India, who could not in
&s;ome mea&s;ure have hurt the Government.
He did not, he &s;aid, take pains to do this
from any idea, that, becau&s;e there was no
motive for plundering the women, it might
be a&s;&s;erted that it was an improbable fal&s;e|hood:
he was not to learn that there
<PB N="26" REF="29">
was &s;uch a thing as wantonne&s;s of wick|edne&s;s.
Tho&s;e, who had doubts on this
point, had only to read the hi&s;tory of the
admini&s;tration of Mr. Ha&s;tings. He pro|ved
by the documents, on the table, that
there was, and had always been, in&s;urrec|tion
and di&s;order in Oude. To a&s;cribe it
to the Begums was the mo&s;t improbable
fiction: they might as well &s;ay, that
famine would not have pinched, that
thir&s;t would not have parched, that exter|mination
would not have depopulated,
but for the interference of the&s;e old women.
To u&s;e a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Ha&s;t|ings,
on another occa&s;ion, <Q>The good
that tho&s;e women did was certain; the
ill was precarious.</Q> He, on the con|trary,
took the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition;
wanting a motive for his rapacity, he could
find it only in fiction. The &s;imple fact
was, their trea&s;ure was their trea&s;on.
They complained of inju&s;tice: God
of heaven! had they not a right to com|plain?
After a &s;olemn treaty violated,
plundered of all their property, and on the
eve of the la&s;t extremity of wretchedne&s;s,
<PB N="27" REF="30">
were they to be deprived of the la&s;t re&s;ource
of impotent wretchedne&s;s, complaint and
lamentation? Was it a crime that they
&s;hould croud together in fluttering trepida|tion,
like a flock of re&s;i&s;tle&s;s birds in the air,
on &s;eeing the felon kite, who, having darted
at one devoted bird and mi&s;&s;ed his aim, &s;in|gled
out a new object, and was &s;pringing on
his prey with more vigour in his wing, and
keener lightning in his eye. The fact with
Mr. Ha&s;tings was preci&s;ely this: having
failed in the cau&s;e of Cheyt Sing, he &s;aw his
fate; he felt the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring a
&s;um of money &s;omewhere, for he knew
that to be the never-failing receipt to
make his peace with the Directors at
home.</P>
<P>Such, Mr. Sheridan added, were the
true, &s;ub&s;tantial motives of the horrid ex|ce&s;&s;es
perpetrated again&s;t the Begums!
Exce&s;&s;es, in every part of the de&s;cription
of which, he felt him&s;elf &s;upported by the
mo&s;t indi&s;putable evidence. Here he
would re&s;t his cau&s;e. Let gentlemen lay
their hands upon their hearts, and with
<PB N="28" REF="31">
truth i&s;&s;uing in all its purity from their
lips, &s;olemnly declare, whether they were,
or were not convinced, that the <HI>real</HI> &s;pring
of the conduct of Mr. H. far from be|ing
a de&s;ire to cru&s;h rebellion, <HI>an ideal fa|bulous
rebellion!</HI> was a malignantly rapa|cious
determination to &s;eize, with lawle&s;s
hands, upon the trea&s;ures of devoted, mi|&s;erable,
yet unoffending victims.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other proofs which Mr. She|ridan
brought again&s;t the &s;econd and
fourth charges, was a minute of what
<HI>Mr. Stables</HI> propo&s;ed at the Board, <Q>Whe|ther
any di&s;affection to the Engli&s;h
Government appeared before the troubles
of Benares?</Q> Mr. Ha&s;tings remained
&s;ilent.</P>
<P>In the farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the charges,
<HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> &s;aid, it would be nece&s;&s;ary
for him to follow the Governor General in
his tour from <HI>Calcutta</HI> to <HI>Chunar,</HI> which
commenced the 8th of July, 1781, a
journey he thought nece&s;&s;ary to take,
finding the Nabob unwilling to &s;eize on
<PB N="29" REF="32">
his mother's jaghires. Mr. Ha&s;tings had
him&s;elf &s;aid, That he left Calcutta with
the &s;tronge&s;t idea of the reduced &s;tate of
the Company's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which the
event proved he went to recruit in the
mo&s;t expeditious manner po&s;&s;ible. Sir
Elijah Impey had &s;aid, when under exa|mination,
that Mr. Ha&s;tings went out
with only two re&s;ources to retrieve the
circum&s;tances of the Company; namely,
Benares and Oude; Countries already
oppre&s;&s;ed by the hand of Providence, but
more &s;o by the wicked and arbitrary ma|chinations
of man. What a horrid idea!
No other re&s;ource but the plunder of a
fami&s;hed country! Can any &s;imile equal
it? unle&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e, a per&s;on determined
on a robbery, and having failed at Bag|&s;hot,
re&s;olves to try his fortune at
Houn&s;low.</P>
<P>In <HI>Benares</HI> it was &s;ufficiently known
that Mr. Ha&s;tings had failed. There
his prodigal revenge had di&s;appointed his
rapacity; whence the unfortunate victim of
malicious in&s;olence had been compelled to
<PB N="30" REF="33">
wander from his kingdom, a melancholy
example of the vici&s;&s;itude of human affairs.
The hopes of plunder at <HI>Oude,</HI> promi&s;ed
to compen&s;ate for his mi&s;carriage at <HI>Be|nares.</HI>
Then, and not till then, not thro'
any former enmities &s;hewn by the Begums,
not thro' any old di&s;turbances, but becau&s;e
he had failed in one place, and that he
had but two in his pro&s;pect, did he con|trive
the expedient of plundering the&s;e aged
women: he had no pretence, he had no
excu&s;e for his conduct, but the arrogant
and ob&s;tinate determination to govern India
by his corrupt will. His di&s;appointment
at <HI>Benares</HI> urged him with rapid &s;teps
to <HI>Oude,</HI> where indeed he was but too
&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Inflamed by di&s;appointment in his fir&s;t
project, he ha&s;tened to the fortre&s;s of
<HI>Chunar,</HI> to meditate the more atrocious
de&s;ign of in&s;tigating a &s;on again&s;t his
mother; of &s;acrificing female dignity and
di&s;tre&s;s to parricide and plunder.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">
The treaty of <HI>Chunar,</HI> that nefarious
foundation of his future views, being
planned, Mr. Ha&s;tings thought it nece&s;|&s;ary,
whil&s;t he was invading the &s;ub&s;tance
of ju&s;tice, to avail him&s;elf of her judi|cial
forms, and accordingly &s;ent for Sir
Elijah Impey, the Chief Ju&s;tice of India,
to a&s;&s;i&s;th im.</P>
<P>Sir Elijah being arrived, Mr. Ha&s;tings,
with much art, propo&s;ed a que&s;tion of
opinion, involving an un&s;ub&s;tantiated fact,
in order to obtain even a &s;urreptitious ap|probation
of the mea&s;ures he had prede|termined
to adopt.</P>
<P>With regard to the mode of &s;ubmit|ting
que&s;tions to Sir Elijah Impey, it
was, he ob&s;erved, &s;ingular and curious.
In re&s;pect to the affairs of Cheit Sing,
Mr. Ha&s;tings had &s;tated the que&s;tion,
not in the ab&s;tract merely, but accom|panied
with the fact. To that que&s;tion
Sir Elijah demurred, not caring to
commit him&s;elf. With regard to the
Begums, Mr. Ha&s;tings profits by his ex|perience,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
and &s;tates the que&s;tion in the
ab&s;tract, &s;aying, "The Begums being in
rebellion, is it not warrantable to &s;eize
their trea&s;ures?" To this, (which like
one of the Duke of Richmond's <HI>data,</HI>
carries with it its own an&s;wer, becau&s;e
<HI>being in rebellion,</HI> the &s;eizure might have
been made,) Sir Elijah an&s;wers directly
and explicitly in the affirmative, there|by
not ri&s;king any thing.</P>
<P>Not a &s;yllable of enquiry intervened as
to the exi&s;tence of the imputed rebellion;
nor a moment's pau&s;e, as to the ill pur|po&s;es
to which the deci&s;ion of a Chief
Ju&s;tice might be perverted. It was not
the office of a friend to mix the grave
caution and cold circum&s;pection of a
judge with an opinion taken in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances;
and Sir Elijah had pre|viou&s;ly
declared, that he gave his advice
not as a judge, but as a friend; a charac|ter
he equally preferred in the &s;trange of|fice
which he undertook of collecting de|fen&s;ive
affidavits on the &s;ubject of Benares.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36">
It was curious, Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, to
reflect on the whole of Sir Elijah's cir|cuit
at that perilous time. Sir Elijah had
&s;tated his de&s;ire of relaxing from the fa|tigues
of office, and unbending his mind
in a party of health and plea&s;ure; yet,
wi&s;ely apprehending that very &s;udden re|laxation
might defeat its purpo&s;e, he
contrived to mix &s;ome objects of bu&s;ine&s;s
with his amu&s;ements. He had therefore
in his little airing of 900 miles, great part
of which he went po&s;t, e&s;corted by an ar|my,
&s;elected tho&s;e very &s;ituations where
in&s;urrections &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and rebellion was
threatened, and had not only delivered his
deep and curious re&s;earches into the laws
and rights of nations, and of treaties, in
the capacity of the oriental Grotius, whom
Warren Ha&s;tings was to &s;tudy, but like|wi&s;e
in the humbler and more practical
&s;ituation of a collector of <HI>ex parte</HI> evidence.
In the former quality his opinion was the
premature &s;anction for plundering the
Begums. In the latter character he be|came
the po&s;thumous &s;upporter of the ex|pul&s;ion
<PB N="34" REF="37">
and pillage of the Rajah Cheyt
Sing.</P>
<P>With a generous oblivion of duty and
honour, with a proud &s;en&s;e of having au|thorized
all future rapacity, and &s;anction|ed
all pa&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, this friendly judge
proceeded on his circuit of health and ea&s;e;
and while the Governor General, &s;anc|tioned
by his &s;olemn opinion, i&s;&s;ued his
orders to plunder the Begums of their
trea&s;ure, Sir Elijah pur&s;ued his progre&s;s,
pa&s;&s;ing through a wide region of di&s;|re&s;s
and mi&s;ery, in que&s;t of objects be&s;t
&s;uited to his feelings, in anxious &s;earch of
calamities mo&s;t kindred to his invalid
imagination. Friend&s;hip, then, made Sir
Elijah forget what was due to him&s;elf,
what was due to the high office in
which he was placed, and to the power
which had placed him in it. He was
the la&s;t man who ought to have un|dertaken
&s;uch an office. He was bound
to have maintained a line of conduct more
con&s;onant with the elevation of his rank,
the dignity of his office, and the gravity of
<PB N="35" REF="38">
a judge; who ought to have felt him&s;elf
incapable of &s;oiling his pure ermine, by
conde&s;cending to run about the country,
like an itinerant informer, with a pedlar's
pack of garbled evidence and &s;urreptitious
affidavits.</P>
<P>He could not be ignorant of the robbery
his errand was intended to cover; for his
fir&s;t que&s;tion mooted the point. The judge
mo&s;t gravely informs us, that he was cau|tioned
not to proceed from <HI>Chunar</HI> by way
of Fyzyabad, as <HI>the Begums were in rebel|lion.</HI>
Mo&s;t friendly advice indeed! Fy|zyabad
was many &s;core of miles out of
the route of <HI>Lucknow</HI> to <HI>Chunar;</HI> and,
at that moment, peace ab&s;olutely prevailed
in every part of the country; his <HI>datum,</HI>
therefore would have been di&s;covered to
be fal&s;e. Nor would it have been very
plea&s;ant for him to be found at Fyzyabad,
with the actual order in his pocket, by
which they were to be plundered, which
happened to be the fact. Here Mr.

When Mr. Ha&s;tings arrived at <HI>Chu|nar,</HI>
he was met by the Nabob with an
open and un&s;u&s;pecting heart. Here the
mo&s;t in&s;idious Treaty on the one part,
that ever was entered into, was con|certed
and concluded; no one article
of it being intended for execution on
the part of the Governor. In the fir&s;t
article it was &s;tipulated with one he calls
an <HI>independent Prince</HI> <Q>That, as
great di&s;tre&s;s has ari&s;en to the Nabob's
government, from the military power
and dominion a&s;&s;umed by the Jag|hierdars,
he be <HI>permitted</HI> to re&s;ume
&s;uch as he may find nece&s;&s;ary; with
a re&s;erve, that all &s;uch, for the amount
of who&s;e Jaghires the Company are
guarantees, &s;hall, in ca&s;e of the re|&s;umption
of their lands, be paid the
amount of their net collections, thro'
the Re&s;ident, in ready money. And
that no Engli&s;h Re&s;ident be appoint|ed
to Furruckabad.</Q></P>
<P>This was &s;olemnly covenanted, in
direct infraction of a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting guaran|tee
<PB N="37" REF="42">
for the protection of the Begum's
Jaghires. And how was this cloaked?
Why, by affidavits, taken extra-judicially
by his Maje&s;ty's Chief Ju&s;tice in Ben|gal,
who &s;ays very guardedly in his
evidence, that &s;everal per&s;ons depo&s;ed
that a de&s;ign was entered into to extir|pate
the Engli&s;h from India. But
when? Not till <HI>after</HI> the tran&s;actions
at Benares, when the weight of the arm
of power compelled that unfortunate
Prince, Cheyt Sing, to become an un|happy
wanderer, and when the name
of <HI>Briton</HI> became dete&s;ted throughout
Hindo&s;tan. This artifice was thin,
and the veil was ea&s;ily &s;een through, for
the plan was preconcerted, long before
the revolution at Benares took place.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t article, containing a general
permi&s;&s;ion to the Nabob to confi&s;cate,
and take into his hands &s;uch Jaghiers as
he might find nece&s;&s;ary, Mr. Ha&s;tings
<HI>inverted</HI> &s;ingularly, by making him con|fi&s;cate
whatever Jaghiers he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43">
The &s;econd article &s;tipulated for the
withdrawing of the Briti&s;h army from
the Province of Oude, which Mr.
Ha&s;tings did, but inverted the article
&s;ingularly, by re&s;erving to him&s;elf a right
to &s;end another army into the Province
when he thought proper. The two
other articles, the one for withdrawing
the Briti&s;h Pre&s;ident at Furruckabad, and
the other &s;tipulating for putting Fizula
Cawn into the hands of the Nabob, both,
by a &s;ingular inver&s;ion, Mr. Ha&s;tings
rendered of no effect or avail.</P>
<P>The un&s;u&s;pecting Nabob, in the
warmth of friend&s;hip, at meeting the
Governor, and concluding a Treaty
which he thought &s;alutary to his intere&s;t,
made him a pre&s;ent of ONE HUNDRED
THOUSAND POUNDS. This, exclaimed
<HI>Mr. Sheridan,</HI> was rank corruption in
<HI>Mr. Ha&s;tings.</HI> The circum&s;tances of
this pre&s;ent were as extraordinary as
the thing it&s;elf. Four months after|wards,
and not till then, Mr. Ha&s;tings
communicated the matter to the Compa|ny;
<PB N="39" REF="44">
unfortunately for him&s;elf however,
this tardy di&s;clo&s;ure was conveyed in
words which betray his original mean|ing;
for, with no common incaution, he
admits the pre&s;ent "<HI>was of a magnitude
not to be concealed.</HI>"</P>
<P>Then it was publi&s;hed and made
known, that Bills on <HI>Gopaul Do&s;s,</HI> the
Banker, (then a pri&s;oner,) were given to
the amount mentioned, payable in four
months. And this was to be extorted
from a country, at the time its Prince
declared his inability to pay his debts,
and when his mini&s;ter <HI>Hyder Beg Cawn</HI>
declared it to be "<HI>a &s;peaking picture of
Famine and Woe.</HI>" <HI>Mr. Sheridan,</HI> in
&s;tating all the circum&s;tances of this bribe,
averred that the whole had its ri&s;e in a
principle of rank corruption; for what was
the price that hepaid? By the treaty he
agreed to withdraw all the Engli&s;h gen|tlemen,
and all the Engli&s;h army. He
agreed to this at the moment of rebel|lion
and revolt. The other articles
of the treaty, as &s;trange, nothing but
<PB N="40" REF="45">
the bribe could have occa&s;ioned, toge|ther
with the re&s;erve which he had in
his own mind, of treachery to the Na|bob;
for the only part of the treaty
which he ever attempted to carry into
execution, was to withdraw the Engli&s;h
gentlemen from <HI>Oude.</HI> The Nabob
con&s;idered this as e&s;&s;ential to his deli|verance,
and his ob&s;ervation on the cir|cum&s;tance
was curious; for, <Q>though
Major Palmer, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> has not
a&s;ked any thing, I ob&s;erve it is the
cu&s;tom of the Engli&s;h gentlemen con|&s;tantly
to a&s;k for &s;omething of me be|fore
they go.</Q> This imputation on
the Engli&s;h Mr. Ha&s;tings countenanced,
mo&s;t readily, and rejoiced at it, as it was
a &s;creen and &s;helter for his own aban|doned
profligacy; and therefore, at the
very moment that he was him&s;elf plun|dering
the Nabob, with his u&s;ual gravity
and cant, making a feint of executing
this part of the Treaty; <Q>Go, &s;aid he,
to the Engli&s;h gentlemen; Go, you &s;et
of oppre&s;&s;ive ra&s;cals; Go from this
worthy unhappy man, whom <HI>you</HI> have
<PB N="41" REF="46">
plundered, and leave him to <HI>my</HI> pro|tection.
You have robbed him, you
have taken advantage of his accumu|lated
di&s;tre&s;&s;es; but, plea&s;e God, he
&s;hall in future be at re&s;t; for I have
promi&s;ed he &s;hall never &s;ee the face
of an Engli&s;hman again.</Q> This how|ever
was the only part of the treaty
which he even attempted to fulfil; and
we learn from him&s;elf, that, at the very
moment he made it, he intended to de|ceive
the Nabob. That he advi&s;ed <HI>ge|neral,</HI>
in&s;tead of <HI>partial</HI> re&s;umption, in
order to defeat the end and view of the
Nabob; and, in&s;tead of having given
in&s;tant and unqualified a&s;&s;ent to all the
articles of the treaty, he had perpetually
qualified, explained, and varied them
with new diminutions and re&s;ervations.</P>
<P>He had &s;uffered the Nabob to take
their Jaghiers from &s;everal Jaghierdars;
but he had compelled him to deprive
others of their's according to his will:
he withdrew the army according to the
<PB N="42" REF="47">
wi&s;h of the vizier, but it was only to
&s;end back almo&s;t in&s;tantly an equivalent
force: he re&s;igned the fortre&s;&s;es, but to
garri&s;on them again immediately. This
might by the friends of Mr. Ha&s;tings,
be deemed policy; but &s;urely it was too
clum&s;y a fraud, too gro&s;s a fallacy, to
de&s;erve that name. It was however like
the man, though unlike the greatne&s;s
a&s;cribed to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan put the whole of this
into a very glaring point of view, and
called upon gentlemen to &s;ay, if there
was any thing in Machiavel, any treach|ery
upon record, if they had ever heard
of any cold Italian fraud, that could in
any degree be put in compari&s;on with
the di&s;gu&s;ting hypocri&s;y, and unequalled
ba&s;ene&s;s, that Mr. Ha&s;tings had &s;hewn
on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In his defence, Mr. Ha&s;tings had made
it his boa&s;t, that the conduct of his life
had been uniformly governed by the
rules of <HI>honour and plain dealing.</HI> He
<PB N="43" REF="48">
a&s;ked, how was this bold and daring
a&s;&s;ertion to be reconciled to his whole
conduct throughout the affair of the
Begums? In every part of which, ob|liquity,
fraud, fal&s;ehood, treachery, op|pre&s;&s;ion,
the mo&s;t glaring violation of
ju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t open breach of
&s;olemn engagements, were the great and
leading features. He had heard it &s;aid by
&s;ome of his admirers, but who were not &s;o
implicit as to give unqualified applau&s;e to
his crimes, that they found an apology for
the atrocity of his actions in the greatne&s;s
of his mind. He could not, upon the
clo&s;e&s;t examination of his conduct, di&s;|cover
the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymptoms of either
a great mind, or great ability. To e&s;|timate
the &s;olidity of &s;uch a defence, it
would be &s;ufficient, merely to con&s;ider
in what con&s;i&s;ted this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing di&s;|tion,
this captivating characteri&s;tic of
greatne&s;s of mind. It was the cha|racteri&s;tic
of magnanimity to aim at
attaining a great end by great means;
to &s;upport truth, to protect the weak,
to relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, to right the
<PB N="44" REF="49">
injured, to puni&s;h tho&s;e that had done
wrong; and, on no con&s;ideration, to
countenance inju&s;tice. In the&s;e traits,
and the&s;e alone, we are to di&s;cover true
e&s;timable magnanimity; to them alone
we can ju&s;tly affix the &s;plendid titles and
honours of real greatne&s;s. Were the&s;e
the characteri&s;ticks of Mr. Ha&s;tings?
Directly the rever&s;e. Mr. Ha&s;tings, in
his conduct and in his writings, exhibit|ed
a &s;y&s;tem made up of things unnatu|rally
conjoined. His letters and his
minutes were full of &s;trutting meanne&s;s,
bomba&s;tical prevarication, and ridicu|lou&s;ly
violent contradictions in terms;
ju&s;t as the ma&s;s and magnitude of his
crimes were contra&s;ted with the little|ne&s;s
of his motives, and the low means
he could conde&s;cend to for the attain|ment
of his objects. The mo&s;t grovel|ing
ideas, he conveyed in the mo&s;t in|flated
language, giving mock con&s;e|quence
to low cavils, and uttering quib|bles
in heroics; &s;o that his compo&s;itions
di&s;gu&s;ted the mind's ta&s;te, as much as
his actions excited the &s;oul's abhor|rence.
<PB N="45" REF="50">
In &s;hort, he appeared to be a
mixture of the trick&s;ter and the ty|rant,
at once a Scapin and a Diony|&s;ius.
It &s;eemed that all his actions
were directed by a low, underhand,
crooked, policy; as well might the
writhing obliquity of the &s;erpent be
compared to the direct and unvaried
&s;wiftne&s;s of the arrow, as the duplicity
of Mr. Ha&s;tings's ambition, to the &s;im|ple
&s;teadine&s;s of genuine magnanimity.
Mr. Ha&s;tings, if he ever acted with
wi&s;dom, it was with perverted wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, that this mixture
of character &s;eemed, by &s;ome unac|countable,
but inherent, quality, to be
appropriated in inferior degrees to eve|ry
thing that concerned his employers.
He remembered to have heard a learned
gentleman (Mr. Dundas) remark, that
there was &s;omething in the original
frame and con&s;titution of the Company,
which carried the &s;ordid ideas of the
mercantile principle on which it was
founded, always about them; &s;o that,
<PB N="46" REF="51">
even in all their mea&s;ures and ac|tions,
we &s;aw the paltry character.
Their civil policy and their military
atchievements were connected with and
contaminated by the meanne&s;s of
pedlars, and the profligacy of pirates.
Thus we &s;aw <HI>auctioneering amba&s;&s;adors,</HI>
and <HI>trading generals.</HI>&mdash;And thus we &s;aw
a revolution brought about by <HI>affidavits,</HI>
an army employed in <HI>executing an ar|re&s;t,</HI>
a town be&s;ieged on <HI>a note of hand;</HI>
a prince dethroned for <HI>the balance of
an account.</HI> They exhibited a go|vernment,
in which they had all the
mock maje&s;ty of a <HI>bloody &s;ceptre;</HI> and the
little <HI>traffick of a merchant's counting
hou&s;e,</HI> wielding a truncheon with one
hand, and he might truly &s;ay, <HI>picking
a pocket with the other.</HI></P>
<P>He then proceeded to &s;tate the conduct
of Mr. Ha&s;tings, in enforcing the re&s;ump|tion
of the Jaghire, and the plunder of the
envied trea&s;ure, of the Begums. On the
27th of Nov. 1781, his plea&s;ure concern|ing
that bu&s;ine&s;s was fir&s;t &s;ent, through
<PB N="47" REF="52">
Sir Elijah Impey, to Mr. Middleton. On
the 1&s;t of December this was backed by
a written order; and it was not, until
the 8th of January following, that the
Nabob could be prevailed on to di&s;mi&s;s
his &s;cruples; nor, until threatened with
the &s;evere&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of the Governor
General, that he could be compelled to
repair to Fyzyabad, to obey the unnatural
mandate, by plundering his parents. A
re&s;i&s;tance was then made by the friends
of the Begums, on finding the violence
intended to them. But, &s;trange to tell!
this re&s;i&s;tance was ab&s;olutely alledged by
Mr. Ha&s;tings in his defence, as the &s;ole
cau&s;e of the violence! That is to &s;ay, the
re&s;i&s;tance of an unju&s;t attack not made
until after the 8th of January, 1782, was
alledged as the foundation of the plea&s;ure
&s;ignified on the 27th of November, 1781,
of the written order by which that was
enforced, and all the determinations which
had &s;o long preceded! Or, in other
words, the order was &s;aid to be founded
on a re&s;i&s;tance made to its being executed,
<PB N="48" REF="53">
near &s;ix weeks after that order was fir&s;t
i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Having gone through the facts of the
tran&s;actions which made up the charge,
<HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> next adverted to the affida|vits
exhibited, and &s;worn before Sir Eli|jah
Impey; and though he &s;aid he might
fairly throw them a&s;ide, and put them out
of the que&s;tion, on account of the indirect
manner in which they were obtained, and
the &s;trange and irrelevant te&s;timony
they afforded, yet he would wave all
objection to them on tho&s;e grounds, and
examine them with as much &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s,
as if they were correctly formal, and
every way unexceptionable; they were
all, he &s;aid, conceived in one &s;pirit, and
formed upon one plan. He then read
the Affidavit of Mr. Middleton, and
clearly pointed out how futile and pre|&s;umptuous
were the grounds upon
which he had, <HI>to the &s;atisfaction of his
con&s;cience,</HI> proceeded to the utmo&s;t ex|tremity
of violence again&s;t the Begums.
<Q>The God of Ju&s;tice, exclaimed he,
<PB N="49" REF="54">
forbid that any man in this Hou&s;e
&s;hould make up his mind to accu&s;e
Mr. Ha&s;tings on the ground that
Mr. Middleton condemned the Be|gums.</Q>
He next animadverted on
the depo&s;itions of Colonel Hannay, Co|lonel
Gordon, Major M`Donald, Major
Williams, and others, from which he
&s;truck out a variety of &s;uch brilliant
detections as baffle memory to follow.</P>
<P>Among&s;t a variety of glaring circum|&s;tances
he pointed out the following:</P>
<P>Major Williams, amid&s;t other ru|mours,
&s;tated one that "<HI>he had heard:</HI>"
That 50 Briti&s;h troops, watching 200
pri&s;oners, had been &s;urrounded by
6000 of the enemy, and mu&s;t inevitably
have fallen a &s;acrifice, if they had not
been relieved by the approach of a de|tachment
of <HI>nine</HI> men. With this
a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had entirely driven away
the enemy, and &s;lain &s;everal hundreds
of them. Con&s;idering the character
given by Mr. H. to the Briti&s;h army in
<PB N="50" REF="55">
Oude, that they manife&s;ted a rage for
rapacity and peculation; it was extra|ordinary
that there were no in&s;tances of
&s;touter &s;wearing. Of Mr. M. he &s;aid,
that he liked not the memory which
remembered things better at the end of
five years, than at the time, unle&s;s there
might be &s;omething &s;o relaxing in the
climate of India, affecting the memory
as well as the nerves, by which the
traces of actions were lo&s;t; and that
men mu&s;t return to their native air of
England and be braced up, and have
their memories like their &s;inews, re|&s;trung.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan pointed out many other
improbabilities, and having in very
&s;trong colours painted the loo&s;e quality
of the affidavits, and clearly and incon|trovertibly
&s;hewn the partiality and in|ju&s;tice,
which was contained in them
again&s;t the Begums, he &s;olemnly ap|pealed
to that &s;ide of the Hou&s;e which
was more peculiarly intere&s;ted in law-proceedings.
They &s;aw that, that Hou&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="56">
was the path to fortune in their pro|fe&s;&s;ion;
that they might &s;oon, and &s;ome
of them were, to be called to a dignified
&s;ituation, where the great and impor|tant
tru&s;t would be repo&s;ed in them, of
protecting the lives and properties of
their fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>One learned gentleman in particu|lar,
was, if rumour &s;poke right, &s;oon
to be called to &s;ucceed that bright lu|minary
of the law, who&s;e &s;un he feared
was &s;etting, but who&s;e departure from
the &s;eat of active ju&s;tice was &s;plendid
and magnificent, in its being done while
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind on which time had
not power to lay his hand: Of the
learned Gentleman, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he
mu&s;t &s;ay, that there was not one cir|cum&s;tance
of his life, except perhaps his
activity on an election conte&s;t, that did
not di&s;tingui&s;h him as a mo&s;t proper
per&s;on to fill the important &s;eat. He
de&s;ired to a&s;k that learned Gentleman,
and every other of the profe&s;&s;ion, would
he lay his hand upon his brea&s;t, and
<PB N="52" REF="57">
&s;olemnly declare, if upon &s;uch evidence
as the ma&s;s of depo&s;itions taken at
Lucknow, any one of them could ven|ture
to &s;ay that, &s;itting as a Judge, he
would be legally warranted to convict
any, the meane&s;t individual of an of|fence,
however trivial. If any one would
&s;ay he could, he declared to God he
would &s;it down, and not add a &s;yllable
more to the too long tre&s;pa&s;s he had
made on the patience of the committee.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Sheridan craved the indul|gence
of the Hou&s;e (<HI>a general and loud
cry of hear! hear!</HI>) whil&s;t he for a mo|ment
enquired into the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI>
of the affidavits, on which the ruin of the
unfortunate Begums was founded. <HI>Colo|nel
Gordon</HI> had exhibited a flagrantly con|&s;picuous
proof of the <HI>grateful &s;pirit and
temper</HI> of affidavits, de&s;igned to plunge
the&s;e wretched women in irretrievable
ruin. Colonel Gordon was but ju&s;t before
<HI>not merely relea&s;ed from danger,</HI> but <HI>pre|&s;erved
from imminent death.</HI> That gentle|man
was in the hands of the in&s;urgents,
<PB N="53" REF="58">
and his relea&s;e was entirely effected by
the negociation of the Bhow Begum. Yet
even at the expiration of two little days
from his deliverance, he depo&s;es again&s;t
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and unfortunate woman, who
had become his <HI>&s;aviour;</HI> and <HI>only</HI> upon
<HI>hear&s;ay evidence,</HI> accu&s;es her of crimes
and rebellion. Upon this occa&s;ion &s;he
manife&s;ted the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to
the Engli&s;h intere&s;t; for, in her pri|vate
letters and di&s;patches to Colonel
Hannay, &s;he particularly de&s;ired that the
Zemindars might not be informed of her
interpo&s;ition in favor of the Colonel:
this was at once a bold and convincing
proof of her unalterable attachment.
Was this a proof of rebellion? <Q><HI>Great
God of ju&s;tice,</HI> (exclaimed the orator)
<HI>can&s;t thou from thy eternal throne look
down upon &s;uch premeditated turpitude of
heart, and not fix &s;ome dreadful mark
of obloquy upon the perpetrators?</HI></Q></P>
<P>If, continues Mr. Sheridan, the&s;e af|fidavits,
becau&s;e they are a mere collec|tion
of hear&s;ays, without a tittle of any
<PB N="54" REF="59">
thing like legal evidence in their compo&s;i|tion,
could not (as I am certain is the
ca&s;e) be received in a court of law, nor
be brought forward in a court of equity,
was it a &s;pecies of evidence &s;ufficient to
ju&s;tify a wanton act of oppre&s;&s;ion, of vio|lence
and gro&s;s inju&s;tice, committed a|gain&s;t
two prince&s;&s;es; the one the wife,
the other the mother of the decea&s;ed
Nabob <HI>Sujah ul Dowlah.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings a&s;&s;erts, that the re&s;ump|tion
of the Jaghires was no injury to the
Begums, for they had their revenue of
them delivered regularly.&mdash;But that was
not truth.&mdash;They never had an equiva|lent
&mdash;they were referred for payment to a
bankrupt, on the faith of a broken gua|rantee.
There never was any informa|tion
that could warrant the &s;eizure of
the Jaghires. It was not done with the
con&s;ent of the Nabob, though he was
forced by Mr. Middleton to give his no|minal
a&s;&s;ent thereto; for Mr. Middleton
had written to Mr. Ha&s;tings, that <HI>a fixed
melancholy had &s;eized the Nabob, on his
<PB N="55" REF="60">
being forced to plunder his mother.</HI> Mr.
Middleton had written to Mr. Ha&s;tings
for his orders, on the 1&s;t of December,
1781, which arrived on the 6th, and on
the 29th of the &s;ame month the whole
was put in execution; but as they per|fectly
knew it was a matter that of cour&s;e
mu&s;t make much noi&s;e, it was deemed
nece&s;&s;ary by Mr. Ha&s;tings and his party,
to throw the whole of the odium on the
Nabob, by in&s;i&s;ting that the propo&s;ition
came from him.&mdash;But the very letter in
which it was a&s;&s;erted that, the Nabob
had not only given his con&s;ent, but even
propo&s;ed this dete&s;table mea&s;ure, could
not be produced; nor any one paper, arti|cle
or authentic evidence to that effect,
notwith&s;tanding the indu&s;try with which
it had been reported.</P>
<P>The Nabob in his letter to Mr. Ha&s;t|ings,
never gave the lea&s;t hint, that either
his mother or grandmother were in re|bellion,
or that they had &s;hewn an incli|nation
to a&s;&s;i&s;t or join with <HI>Cheyt Sing,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="61">
or that they meant to extirpate the En|gli&s;h,
or dethrone him.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan proceeded to demon&s;trate,
that the prince&s;&s;es were in every &s;en&s;e of
the word, entitled to their Jaghires and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as much as any lady in Eng|land
to her dower, on the death of her
Lord. That this opinion had not &s;o much
as been called in que&s;tion, till the time
that Mr. Ha&s;tings began to &s;et his heart
upon their trea&s;ures;&mdash;and that a&s;&s;erting
the contrary, under the Mahomedan law,
was neither founded in ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, nor
even that law, and this, Mr. Sheridan
proved beyond the power of contradiction.</P>
<P>He then &s;hewed, from a variety of
&s;tatements from Mr. Ha&s;tings's own pa|pers,
that the Nabob never entertained an
idea that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his mother
were his, during her life&mdash;on the con|trary,
that his father <HI>Sujah ul Dowlah,</HI> had
left her in the tranquil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
e&s;tates and trea&s;ures, for the mere purpo&s;e
of &s;upporting her dignity in the &s;tile be|coming
<PB N="57" REF="62">
her rank and birth.&mdash;Mr. She|ridan
ob&s;erved, that when <HI>A&s;oph ul Dowla</HI>
blamed his father for leaving &s;o little
wealth, he thought like an unwi&s;e prince&mdash;
His father Sujah ul Dowla acted prudent|ly,
in leaving him with no temptation
about him, to invite acts of violence from
the rapacious. <Q>He cloathed him with
poverty as a &s;hield, and armed him
with nece&s;&s;ity as a &s;word.</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of his poverty and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es,
the <HI>Bhow Begum</HI> his mother it
was true, made her &s;on many pre&s;ents,
and even lent him money, for which he
had given an equivalent; and once, on
his repre&s;enting his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation,
&s;he had returned all his pledges and a
very large &s;um of money, &s;uch as &s;he
thought would finally put an end to his
di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The Nabob her &s;on had
given a receipt to that effect, which re|ceipt
was read by Mr. Sheridan, who
&s;trongly pointed out the obligation he was
under to her. He then enlarged upon the
character and e&s;timation in which the
<PB N="58" REF="63">
Prince&s;&s;es were held, and in the mo&s;t pa|thetic
language, dwelt on the purity of
their conduct, the reciprocal return of
filial and parental affection.</P>
<P>When Mr. Middleton went to &s;eize Fy|zyabad,
the eunuchs were taken pri&s;oners,
as was the Fouzder of Tanda; him how|ever,
it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to de|tain;
he had not the key of the trea&s;ure;
the eunuchs had that, and they of cou&s;e
were the principal objects.&mdash;It was a&s;&s;ert|ed
that the Nabob gave puerile excu&s;es for
not plundering his mother.&mdash;Rea&s;ons for
not performing the wor&s;t of actions, the
mo&s;t unnatural crime, that of a child ruin|ing
his parent, was by a Chri&s;tian Gover|nor
thought puerile.&mdash;Was it to be &s;up|po&s;ed
that, two old, infirm women, who&s;e
whole dependence was on the Briti&s;h po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
one of whom had been a witne&s;s
of the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms, for the
Briti&s;h arms had depo&s;ed her hu&s;band,
Sujah ul Dowlah, and Briti&s;h genero&s;ity
had again placed him in his dominions,
&s;hould wi&s;h to extirpate the Engli&s;h?&mdash;
<PB N="59" REF="64">
Saib Ally's behaviour was pa&s;&s;ed over,
as having done more good, by pre&s;erving
a few pri&s;oners, than he had done harm;
Why was not the &s;ame favour &s;hewn to
the Begums? When the foot of the op|pre&s;&s;or
was taken off, the trodden on ro&s;e
again&s;t the per&s;ecutor, as again&s;t another
Sujah. What a mi&s;erable &s;ituation mu&s;t
the poor unfortunate wretches be in,
to have tho&s;e for their judges, who would
benefit by their de&s;truction!</P>
<P>When the Court of Directors &s;ent to
Mr. Ha&s;tings, to revi&s;e the charge again&s;t
the Begums, and Mr. Stables moved that
revi&s;ion in council, he was over-ruled by
Mr. Ha&s;tings, who &s;aid, that <Q><HI>the ma|je&s;ty
of ju&s;tice ought to be approached
with &s;olicitation, and that it would deba&s;e
it&s;elf by the &s;ugge&s;tion of wrongs, and the
promi&s;e of redre&s;s.</HI></Q>&mdash;Con&s;cious however
of the enormity of his conduct, he apolo|gizes
to the Court of Directors, by &s;tating,
that it would be "<HI>a very &s;evere ta&s;k for a
mother to impeach her &s;on;</HI>"&mdash;&s;o that ac|cording
to his idea, it was no crime for a
<PB N="60" REF="65">
&s;on to rob and plunder his parents, but it
was a crime of a very deep dye, for an in|jured
parent to complain of the outrage
of her child.</P>
<P>He next proceeded to &s;hew, that Mr.
Ha&s;tings, and <HI>he alone,</HI> was the actor
and perpetrator of tho&s;e crimes. That
he was regularly acquainted with all the
enormities committed, there was the clear|e&s;t
proof. It was true that Middleton
was rebuked for not being more exact.
He did not, perhaps, de&s;cend to the de|tail;
he did not give him an account of
the number of groans, which were heaved,
of the quantity of tears which were &s;hed,
of the weight of the fetters, or of the
depth of the dungeons; but he communi|cated
every &s;tep that he took to accom|pli&s;h
the ba&s;e and unwarrantable end. He
proved by his letters, dated in Jan. 1782,
that he alone was re&s;pon&s;ible for the whole
proceedings. Mr. Ha&s;tings well knew that,
the ja ghire and the trea&s;ure were the only
means which the Begums were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of, to &s;upport the numerous family
<PB N="61" REF="66">
of the late Nabob, amounting to more
than two thou&s;and per&s;ons.</P>
<P>After having in the mo&s;t pathetic and
forcible manner given an affecting de&s;|cription
of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the&s;e unfor|tunate
prince&s;&s;es, he went farther into the
expo&s;ure of the evidence; into a compa|ri&s;on
of dates and the &s;ub&s;equent cir|cum&s;tances,
in order to prove that, all the
enormous con&s;equences that followed from
the re&s;umption, in the captivity of the
women and the impri&s;onment and cruel|ties
practi&s;ed upon their people, were &s;olely
to be a&s;cribed and imputed to <HI>Mr. Ha&s;t|ings.</HI>
He &s;aid that Mr. Ha&s;tings had
once remarked, <Q>that a mind touched
with &s;uper&s;tition might have contem|plated
the fate of the Rohillas with
peculiar impre&s;&s;ions.</Q> But if indeed the
mind of Mr. Ha&s;tings had been touched
with &s;uper&s;tition; if <HI>his</HI> fancy could &s;uffer
any di&s;turbance, and even in vi&s;ion, he could
imagine that he beheld the great &s;pirit
of <HI>Sujah Dowlah</HI> looking down on the
ruin he had wrought on his hou&s;e&mdash;in
<PB N="62" REF="67">
that palace which Mr. Ha&s;tings had fir&s;t
wre&s;ted from his hand, and afterwards
re&s;tored to him;&mdash;plundered by that
very army, by which Sujah Dowlah had
been able to vanqui&s;h the Mahrattas&mdash;
&s;eizing on the very plunder which he had
ravaged from the Rohillas;&mdash;<HI>that</HI> MID|DLETON
who had been engaged in ma|naging
the previous violations, mo&s;t bu&s;y
to perpetrate the la&s;t; <HI>that very</HI> HAST|INGS,
whom on his death-bed he
had left the guardian of his wife and
mother, and family; turning all tho&s;e
dear relatives, the objects of his &s;olemn
tru&s;t, forth to the mercile&s;s &s;ea&s;on, and
to a more mercile&s;s &s;oldiery!&mdash;A mind
touched with &s;uper&s;tition, mu&s;t indeed
have cheri&s;hed &s;uch a contemplation with
very peculiar impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings had endeavoured to throw
a portion of the guilt upon the Council,
although Mr. Wheeler had never taken
any &s;hare, and Mr. M`Pher&s;on was not
arrived in India when the &s;cene began.
<HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> remarked, that he had
<PB N="63" REF="68">
&s;hrunk from the inquiry ordered by the
Court of Directors under the new, and
pompous doctrine, that the maje&s;ty of
ju&s;tice was to be approached with &s;uppli|cation,
and was not to degrade it&s;elf, by
hunting for crimes. If his picture of
ju&s;tice was right, then the Committees
of this Hou&s;e, in the examination of
Smith, were wrong&mdash;Mr. Dundas was
wrong.&mdash;He hoped however, that Mr.
Ha&s;tings would be found wrong.</P>
<P><Q>I tru&s;t, &s;aid the eloquent Speaker,
that this Hou&s;e will vindicate the in|&s;ulted
character of ju&s;tice,&mdash;that they
will demon&s;trate its true quality, e&s;&s;ence,
and purpo&s;es,&mdash;that they will evidence
it to be, in the ca&s;e of Mr. Ha&s;tings,
<HI>active, inqui&s;itive,</HI> and <HI>avenging.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> having in the cour&s;e of
his wonderful Speech taken a mo&s;t com|prehen&s;ive
view of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and ex|amined
with the mo&s;t elaborate re|&s;earch
and &s;crutinizing attention, every
circum&s;tance with which it was con|nected;
<PB N="64" REF="69">
having urged every thing which
he thought nece&s;&s;ary to develope the
iniquitous conduct of Mr. Ha&s;tings, to
&s;ub&s;tantiate the charge, and to e&s;tabli&s;h
it by the incontrovertible evidence of
an infinity of facts; he drew towards a
conclu&s;ion, by &s;tating a &s;ummary of the
great points contained in it. He con|tended
and maintained that it was evi|dent
the Begums had done nothing to
merit &s;uch violence, that the pretence
of their having been the fomenters of
rebellion, with a view to exterminate
the Engli&s;h from the province of Oude,
was a mere pretence, wholly unfound|ed,
and not &s;upported by any evi|dence,
and that &s;uch an idea had never
been conceived, until Mr. Ha&s;tings con|cluded
that to be the probable means, and
a favourite re&s;ource for the obtainment of
money,&mdash;a re&s;ource that he was deter|mined,
in defiance of rea&s;on, ju&s;tice,
and humanity, and at all events, to
make certain of. Mr. Ha&s;tings had violat|ed
the the &s;olemn guarantee of the Company,
and had broken their faith, pledged by
<PB N="65" REF="70">
treaty; he had throughout his conduct
been guided by ba&s;ene&s;s, fal&s;ehood, and
oppre&s;&s;ion; entering into treaties, and
framing &s;tipulations, which at the mo|ment
he was concluding and agreeing
upon, he had no purpo&s;e of fulfilling.
&mdash;Mr. Ha&s;tings had degraded and &s;unk
the dignity and character of the highe&s;t
and mo&s;t honourable office, that of a
<HI>Chief Ju&s;tice,</HI> by making <HI>Sir Elijah
Impey</HI> run about the country collecting
affidavits.&mdash;He had, by paltry quib|bles,
and pitiful eva&s;ions, neglected to
proceed upon the enquiry directed by
the Board at the India-Hou&s;e; taking a
mean advantage of the Directors orders,
and had cloathed that eva&s;ion with a
pompous parade of words, and a ridi|culous
di&s;play of non&s;en&s;ical phra&s;es on
the maje&s;ty of Ju&s;tice.&mdash;That through
the whole of the tran&s;action the con|duct
of the Governor-General had been
marked with the mo&s;t &s;candalous du|plicity,
the ba&s;e&s;t perfidy, the mo&s;t
unparalleled and grinding oppre&s;&s;ion,
and the mo&s;t in&s;olent, wanton, and un|manly
<PB N="66" REF="71">
cruelty.&mdash;He had made a &s;on
plunder his mother and grand-mother,
and reduced to di&s;tre&s;s two prince&s;&s;es
of high rank;&mdash;he had &s;ullied and di&s;|graced
the Briti&s;h name and character.</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings, he ob&s;erved, was a
man of wonderful pre&s;cience, for it was
evident that he knew nothing of what
would lend his conduct a colour of ju&s;|tification,
till after it was over; but he
<HI>fore&s;aw</HI> that there would be proof of a
rebellion, and,&mdash;&s;trange to tell!&mdash;it turn|ed
out exactly as he predicted.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> then made a &s;olemn
appeal to the Hou&s;e, conveyed in &s;uch
a &s;ublime and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;tile of ele|gance,
and worked up with &s;uch pathos
and dignity, in &s;uch fa&s;cinating lan|guage,
that the Hou&s;e was wrapped in
mute attention: To keep way with him
through &s;uch a rapid &s;tream of elo|quence,
de&s;ies all power of retention:
it was wholly impracticable to do more
than watch the current as it flowed,
<PB N="67" REF="72">
and now and then ca&s;ually to gra&s;p
&s;ome pa&s;&s;ing flowers, within our reach.</P>
<P>He &s;tated to the Hou&s;e, that the mat|ter
of charge was no que&s;tion of party.
Factions and parties, he knew, exi&s;ted
in that hou&s;e. The prerogative of the
Crown found its advocates among the
people's repre&s;entatives. The privileges of
the people met with their opponents.
Habits, connections, parties, all led to a
diver&s;ity of opinions. The mea&s;ures of
every mini&s;ter were &s;upported by one body
of men, and thwarted by another; but on
great que&s;tions, they had, he was happy to
remark, often di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, by
laying a&s;ide all petty party con&s;iderations,
and acting with a firmne&s;s and deci&s;ion
that reflected honour upon their cha|racter.
&mdash;When Inhumanity pre&s;ented
it&s;elf, when the maje&s;ty of Ju&s;tice was
to be &s;upported, he tru&s;ted no divi&s;ion
could be found among them. When
the former became the object of their
attention, they would &s;it upon it as their
<PB N="68" REF="73">
common enemy, as if the character of
the land were involved in their zeal for
its ruin, and they would leave it not,
till it was completely overthrown.&mdash;He
hoped they would now &s;tep forward, re|gardle&s;s
of the mini&s;ter,&mdash;regardle&s;s of
the influence of the Crown,&mdash;and vote
again&s;t the mo&s;t enormous crimes that
ever di&s;graced human nature.&mdash;On the
pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, they were called upon
to retrieve millions of their fellow crea|tures
from a &s;tate of mi&s;ery and oppre&s;|&s;ion.
It was true, they could not &s;ee the
innumerable beings, who&s;e wretchedne&s;s
they would relieve; the multitudes of
fami&s;hed females had not reached the
Hou&s;e, and terrified it into a contempla|tion
of their mi&s;eries; but for that rea&s;on,
the more magnanimous would their con|duct
be, the more glorious their determi|nation
to puni&s;h &s;uch delinquency. Was
a Briti&s;h Parliament to wait for their bar
to be &s;urrounded with the &s;creams of
expiring children, and the &s;hrieks of &s;tarv|ing
women, before they &s;tooped to redre&s;s
their grievances?&mdash;No&mdash;Let the world
<PB N="69" REF="74">
behold an example, that the Commons
of Great-Britain will &s;tretch the &s;trong
arm of ju&s;tice acro&s;s the habitable globe,
to &s;hew in glowing colours the greatne&s;s
and power of a Briti&s;h Parliament, in
reprobating inju&s;tice, in &s;tigmatizing in|humanity,
and in delivering over to con|dign
puni&s;hment, tho&s;e who u&s;ed unlimit|ed
power, merely for the purpo&s;es of ty|ranny,
oppre&s;&s;ion, rapacity, and perfidy.
It was not given to that Hou&s;e, as it was to
the officers who had the felicity to relieve,
and the &s;till greater tran&s;port of a &s;u&s;|ceptible
mind, to perceive the extatic
emotions of gratitude in the in&s;tant of
deliverance. They could not behold the
workings of the heart, the quivering lips,
the trickling tears, the loud, though tre|mulous
joys of the millions, whom their
vote that night would &s;natch from the
tyranny of <HI>corrupt power.</HI> But, though
the&s;e circum&s;tances were not perceptible
to them, was not the true enjoyment of
benevolence encrea&s;ed, by the ble&s;&s;ing
being conferred un&s;een: Would not the
<HI>omnipotence of Briti&s;h ju&s;tice, and a Briti&s;h
<PB N="70" REF="75">
Parliament</HI> be demon&s;trated, to the wonder
of nations, by &s;tretching its mighty arm
acro&s;s the Globe, and &s;aving by its <HI>fiat</HI>
millions from de&s;truction! And would
the ble&s;&s;ings of the people, thus &s;aved,
diffu&s;e in empty air! No!&mdash;<Q>Heaven,
&s;ays he, if I may dare to u&s;e the figure,
&mdash;Heaven it&s;elf &s;hall become the Agent
to receive the ble&s;&s;ings of their pious
gratitude, and to waft them to your
bo&s;oms.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan returned his warme&s;t
thanks to the Hou&s;e for the indulgence
he had experienced in a &s;peech that car|ried
him beyond the limits of his &s;trength;
but he tru&s;ted, that &s;trength would &s;oon
be repaired, from the con&s;ideration of
having endeavoured to di&s;charge his duty
in the &s;upport of untainted innocence.</P>
<P>He then concluded,</P>
<P><Q>It is with confidence I now move
Sir, that Warren Ha&s;tings be impeach|ed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="76">
The que&s;tion was then read by the
clerk to the following purpo&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>That the Committee, upon hearing
evidence, and con&s;idering the &s;aid charge,
are of opinion, that there is &s;ufficient
ground to impeach Warren Ha&s;tings,

upon the matter of the &s;aid
charge,</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Burge&s;s</HI> &s;poke for nearly an hour
in defence of Mr. Ha&s;tings, which de|fence
he grounded on the 10th report,
when</P>
<P><HI>Sir William Dolben</HI> ro&s;e, and ob&s;erved,
that Mr. Sheridan having in his &s;peech
&s;tated in &s;o able a manner, &s;uch a variety
of facts and arguments, as mu&s;t have ex|hau&s;ted
the &s;pirits, as well as the atten|tion
of the Committee, he therefore re|commended
an adjournment.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Stanhope</HI> was of the &s;ame opinion,
and was determined not to give his vote,
till he had again collected his rea&s;on, and
<PB N="72" REF="77">
had given the &s;ubject a new and &s;erious
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Fox</HI> argued again&s;t the adjourn|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Major Scott</HI> ro&s;e, and accu&s;ed Mr. She|ridan
of having been guilty of <HI>mo&s;t gro&s;s
mi&s;repre&s;entations;</HI> that in referring to &s;e|veral
parts of the corre&s;pondence relative
to the Begums, <HI>he had omitted &s;everal parts
of the letters,</HI> and offered to proceed to the
proof, when</P>
<P><HI>The Chancellor of the Exchequer,</HI> in a
very candid and liberal manner, pa&s;&s;ed
many de&s;erving and high encomiums on
Mr. Sheridan's &s;peech, and was &s;trenuous
for the adjournment.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Fox</HI> replied to Mr. Pitt, and in a
&s;peech of &s;ome length, &s;till oppo&s;ed any
adjournment:&mdash;this brought up</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Wilberforce,</HI> who, for &s;imilar rea|&s;ons

<P><PB N="73" REF="78">
<HI>Mr. Fox</HI> ro&s;e to explain, and among&s;t

<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> &s;aid, that he &s;hould not

<Q>THURSDAY the 8th.</Q>
<P>The Hou&s;e having met, and re&s;olved
it&s;elf into a Committee, the &s;ubject was
re&s;umed. <HI>Mr. Pitt</HI> bore a con&s;picuous
part in the debate. At the conclu&s;ion
of his &s;peech,</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> ro&s;e, and &s;aid, that after
the extraordinary indulgence which he
had the honour to experience la&s;t night,
he would now tre&s;pa&s;s but a few minutes
on their time. He felt him&s;elf, however,
called upon to congratulate the Right Hon.
Gentleman, <HI>(Mr. Pitt,)</HI> on the very able,
candid, and manly, manner in which he
had delivered his &s;entiments on that occa|&s;ion.
He congratulated the Hou&s;e, he
congratulated his country, that in the
cau&s;e of humanity, they &s;aw a Mini&s;ter
who was not to be bia&s;&s;ed by any motives
<PB N="75" REF="80">
of political intere&s;t, who by his conduct
on that day, had placed his character
above the reach of &s;u&s;picion. He was
not &s;o vain as to imagine, that any argu|ments
he had advanced on the &s;ubject
had made any impre&s;&s;ion on the Right
Honourable Gentleman's mind; if they
had, it was more a tribute to the cau&s;e of
truth and ju&s;tice than a compliment to
him.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to what the Hon. Gen|tleman
(Major Scott) had mentioned, of
his being alluded to as one of the <HI>depend|ents</HI>
of Mr. Ha&s;tings, Mr. Sheridan de|clared
upon his honour, that, if he made
u&s;e of &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, he had not the
&s;malle&s;t intention of conveying any in&s;i|nuation
that tended to reflect on the Hon.
Gentleman. He had every allowance to
make for opinions that were formed on
the prejudices of human nature. He was
not &s;urpri&s;ed that the Hon. Gentleman
viewed the conduct of Mr. Ha&s;tings in a
light different from other men, for when
the <HI>heart</HI> acknowledged an obligation, it
<PB N="76" REF="81">
would never &s;uffer the <HI>judgment</HI> to be in|fluenced
by it. If he had uttered har&s;h
expre&s;&s;ions, he declared they were not the

vindictive malice;&mdash;he thanked God, he
had a heart incapable of cheri&s;hing either,
and, if he had &s;poken warmly, it was on
a que&s;tion which, he confe&s;&s;ed had deep|ly
agitated his mind and excited his feel|ings.
