<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Friends in this Place rejoiced at the News of your Election, not &s;o much out of Love to you as to their Country. We applauded the Hap|pine&s;s or Wi&s;dom of your Electors, who at a time when <HI>England</HI> is &s;o much in danger, made choice of a Member to &s;erve it in Parliament, who &s;o truly loves it, and &s;o thoroughly under&s;tands its Intere&s;t; who has Sen&s;e enough to know that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Principles alone can make an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and to contemn the unthinking Crowd, who prefer the Name to the Thing; who knows that he is mo&s;t an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who does mo&s;t for <HI>England</HI>'s Happine&s;s; and who prefers a Foreigner that endeavours to &s;upport it, be|fore an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> who attempts to en&s;lave it; and e&s;teems one who was born a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> or perhaps a <HI>German,</HI> but isbecome an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> before one who was born indeed
<PB N="4" REF="3">
an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> but is become an Errant <HI>Frenchman.</HI> For every Hone&s;t and Brave Man will love an Hone&s;t and Brave Man, and hate a Knave and a Coward, which every Traitor to his Country is.</P>
<P>No Man knows better than your &s;elf the Nature and End of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you; that Senators are &s;ent up to the Great Council to pre&s;erve the Pro|perties of tho&s;e who &s;ent them; which is the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Original and End of Government: that nothing an rightly come within the Compa&s;s of your Debates, but what has a relation to that Care; and that to do any thing contrary to it is to betray the Tru&s;t repos'd in you. No Man is more fully convinc'd that the Pro|perties of the People of <HI>England</HI> are now in the utmo&s;t Danger, both from a formidable Enemy abroad, and from a re&s;tle&s;s Party at home. No Man con&s;equent|ly can be more &s;atisfied, that it is your Duty to do all that lies in your power to enable her Maje&s;ty to re&s;i&s;t the Foreign Force that would conquer us, and the Dome&s;tick Arts of tho&s;e who by &s;owing Divi&s;ions among us, would render us an ea&s;y Prey to the Con|queror.</P>
<P>As &s;ome among us would &s;ell us for Money, &s;o others would barter us for Dominion, and a third &s;ort, who are the Tools of the former, would betray us out of Con&s;cience. But the Artifices of no &s;ort of Men are &s;o dangerous, as of tho&s;e who pretend them &s;acred, and would make them pa&s;s upon the Minds of Men for Religion.</P>
<P>Such &s;eems to me to be the Intention of a Book, which was lately publi&s;hed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and licens'd by the Vice Chancellor of that Univer&s;ity, call'd, <HI>The Political</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<HI>Union</HI>; which is manife&s;tly writ with a de&s;ign to take off the Act of Toleration, and to advance the Tem|poral Power of the Church, which would not fail to divide and weaken us more and more, and make our Condition de&s;perate.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e is founded upon a Text in the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Proverbs</HI> and the 15<HI>th, By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice.</HI> From which the Author has drawn this following Propo&s;ition, which is the Subject Matter of his Pamphlet.</P>
<Q>That Religion is the Grand Support of Govern|ment; that the Peace, Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity of the Secular and Civil Power depends upon that of the Spiritual and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</Q>
<P>In all my Life-time I never met with any Di&s;cour&s;e that was writ with le&s;s Religion and le&s;s Good-manners, or with more Sophi&s;try or more Malice; tho indeed he has taken pretty good care to moderate its Venom by Dulne&s;s, as they who make <HI>Venus Treacle</HI> are wont to temper Vipers with <HI>Opium.</HI></P>
<P>But that we may di&s;cover the Sophi&s;try of the whole Di&s;cour&s;e more clearly, let us divide this Propo&s;ition into the following Branches.<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Religion is the Grand Support of Government.</ITEM>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Religion is the Grand Support of Government. Where by Religion may be meant two things.<LIST>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<ITEM>1. Religion it &s;elf, and the Power it has over the Minds of Men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Prie&s;tcraft; which comprehends all that the Arts of de&s;igning Men cau&s;e to pa&s;s for Religion with the un|thinking part of the World, tho it is neither dictated by the Law of Nature, nor included in the Written Word. And here we &s;hall &s;hew that Religion taken in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e is the Support of Government; but that taken in the latter it nece&s;&s;arily tends to the utter Subver&s;ion of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Religion, and the Power that it has o'er the Minds of Men, is the Support of Government. For without the Ob&s;ervance of Moral Virtue there can be no Govern|ment, and moral Virtue is undeniably Religion. But now if Government depends on Religion, what &s;ort of Reli|gion mu&s;t that Per&s;on have, who endeavours at &s;uch a juncture as this to &s;et three Nations all in confu&s;ion, and to bring all things to Anarchy? Or whether is He a more able State&s;man, who makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;oment the Divi&s;ions of a People engag'd in a War with a very potent Enemy; or a more pious Churchman, who goes about to extingui&s;h the Remains of Charity that are in the Minds of Chri&s;tians? But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Prie&s;tcraft is de&s;tructive to Government. And that we may make this the more plain to the Reader, let us explain a little farther what we mean by Prie&s;tcraft. Prie&s;t|craft is an Art by which De&s;igning Men, in order to their own advantage, make that pa&s;s for Religion upon the unthinking part of the World, that is neither dictated by the Law of Nature, nor included in the written Religion of the Country. From which it follows that that mu&s;t needs be Prie&s;tcraft with a vengeance, that would make
<PB N="7" REF="6">
any thing pa&s;s for Religion which is contrary to the Law of Nature, or to the Precepts or De&s;ign of written Religion. Now the chief Virtues of the Chri&s;tian Religion are Cha|rity, Humility, Meekne&s;s, Peace-making, Mercy: &s;o that among Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts every Doctrine is Prie&s;tcraft that is repugnant to the&s;e. All then that &s;avours of Per|&s;ecution, is Prie&s;tcraft; becau&s;e it is contrary to Humility, to Meekne&s;s, to Mercy, to Peace-making, and above all to Charity; for the want of which no other part of Re|ligion, no not the abundance of Faith it &s;elf, is able to make amends. All that the Clergy do to advance their Temporal Greatne&s;s is Prie&s;tcraft; becau&s;e that is con|trary to Humility, Meekne&s;s and Purity, and con&s;equently &s;uch Prie&s;tcraft is de&s;tructive to Government. For if Government depends on Religion, then any thing that does hurt to the latter mu&s;t do it to the former. But no|thing does more hurt to Religion than Prie&s;tcraft, becau&s;e this alone makes more Athei&s;ts than any thing in the world be&s;ides: For many People are apt to imagine that there can be nothing in Religion, when they &s;ee that the Prie&s;ts who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant in it, make it a mere Pretext. And more particularly I believe that Prie&s;tcraft has done more harm to the Chri&s;tian Religion even than open Im|morality. For what rea&s;on can be given why Dei&s;m and avowed Athei&s;m &s;hould be more propagated &s;ince the e&s;ta|li&s;hing of the true Religion than ever they were before; unle&s;s it be this, that perhaps there has been more Prie&s;t|craft in it than ever there has been in any other Religion? But further, when Mr. <HI>S.</HI> &s;ays that Religion is the Support of Government, he means either Religion in general, or only the True Religion. If he means Religion in ge|neral, can any thing be more ab&s;urd than to write a Book
<PB N="8" REF="7">
for the proving of that which never any one was &s;tupid enough to deny? For as far back as Hi&s;tory reaches, there is no mention of any Government without a National Re|ligion, which &s;hews the Sen&s;e of Mankind in the ca&s;e. But now at this rate what occa&s;ion can there be for per&s;e|cuting, or for the Magi&s;trates tolerating only one Religi|on, when it is plain that Government is &s;upported by all? But if Mr. <HI>S.</HI> means that Government is &s;upported only by the True Religion, he manife&s;tly errs, becau&s;e Experience tells us, that &s;everal Governments flouri&s;h at this pre&s;ent time in the World under the Pagan and <HI>Mahometan,</HI> as well as under the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>But if Mr. <HI>S.</HI> means that Government is be&s;t &s;upported by the True Religion, we grant it; but even that may &s;erve to &s;hew the Folly and the Danger of Prie&s;tcraft. For if Government depends on Religion, and the Chri|&s;tian Religion hath &s;een more Divi&s;ions, more Confu&s;ions, and more Civil Wars in the Nations in which it has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, than ever any Religion did before; why then it follows, that if it is the be&s;t of Religions, it has had the wor&s;t of Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity is certainly to unite Mankind more clo&s;ely; but &s;ome crafty Per&s;ons who have made that their Pretence, and &s;ecular Intere&s;t and Power their Bu&s;ine&s;s, have been indu&s;trious to wre&s;t it from its pure Intention, and have made u&s;e of it to &s;ow fatal Divi&s;ions in Kingdoms and Commonwealths; Divi&s;ions contrary to their private Happine&s;s, their Political Safety, and to the Intention of that very Religion which is made the Pretence for &s;upporting them.</P>
<P>For what can be the Rea&s;on that the Chri&s;tian Religion, who&s;e De&s;ign is Union, has been made u&s;e of to &s;ow
<PB N="9" REF="8">
more Divi&s;ions and more Di&s;&s;en&s;ions in the Nations in which it has been e&s;tabli&s;h'd, than ever the Pagan Religion did among the antient <HI>Romans</HI>; but becau&s;e too many of the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts interfere with Government, which the <HI>Romans</HI> were by much too wi&s;e to permit to theirs?</P>
<P>But further, let us ask Mr. <HI>S.</HI> If the Civil Government is be&s;t &s;upported by the True Religion, which is the True Religion; the Chri&s;tian Religion in general, or any par|ticular Branch of it, as for example, that which is call'd the Church of <HI>England?</HI> If the Chri&s;tian Religion in ge|neral be the True Religion, then why &s;hould any Branch of it be refus'd to be tolerated? But if only the Church of <HI>England</HI> be the True Religion, I would fain ask Mr. <HI>S.</HI> if a Chri&s;tian can be &s;av'd in no other Branch of the Chri|&s;tian Religion? And if he an&s;wers, that that can be done, I would ask him if that Religion can be fal&s;e which pro|cures the Salvation of Souls; or if that Religion which procures the Salvation of Souls, and con&s;equently is ac|ceptable and agreeable to God, ought to Men to be odious and intolerable? But if Mr. <HI>S.</HI> affirms that no one can be &s;av'd out of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; I mu&s;t ask him once more, in which of the Churches of <HI>England</HI> a Man may be &s;av'd, that I may know in which he mu&s;t be damn'd? Mr. <HI>S.</HI> would oblige me by telling me which is the fal&s;e Church of <HI>England.</HI> For &s;ince he tells us, <HI>Pag.</HI> 61. that there is a true Church of <HI>England,</HI> it follows nece&s;&s;arily that there mu&s;t be a fal&s;e one. Now which is the true, and which is the fal&s;e one? or which is the True, and which is the Fal&s;e Prie&s;thood? For we may know the Flock by the Pa&s;tors. Is that the True that neglects and for&s;akes the Go&s;pel for a fooli&s;h little Secular Greatne&s;s; that is lo&s;t in Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the De&s;ire of Power, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and the Pride of Life; who tho our Saviour commanded his Apo&s;tles not to take two Coats, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 10. will be &s;atisfied each of them with no le&s;s than four Benefices, and who have nothing that is Apo&s;tolical in them, but the calling for Fire from Heaven, like <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> upon tho&s;e who will not receive them; who breathe forth no|thing but Rage and Malice, and the Fury of Per&s;ecution? Is this the True, the Chri&s;tian Catholick Prie&s;thood? No, the&s;e are &s;o many Antichri&s;ts, if we will believe St. <HI>John,</HI> Epi&s;t. 1. ch. 2. v. 22. <HI>Who is a Liar, but he who denieth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t? He is Antichri&s;t who denieth the Father and the Son.</HI> Now no Man denies the Saviour of the World &s;o effectually as by his Works: St. <HI>Peter</HI> denied him in Words, and yet believed in him; but he who denies him by his Works, denies him from his very Heart. Now he denies him by his Works the mo&s;t effectually, who&s;e Works &s;hew lea&s;t of Charity. <HI>In this</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>John</HI> in Epi&s;t. 1. ch. 3. v. 10.) <HI>the Children of God are manife&s;t, and the Children of the Devil: Who&s;oever doth not Righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God, neither he who loveth not his Brother.</HI></P>
<P>If the Church of <HI>England</HI> is the True Religion, that &s;ure mu&s;t be its true, its Catholick Prie&s;thood, tho&s;e Mode|rate, Humble, Peace-making, Merciful Men, who breathe forth nothing but Charity; who neglect all Worldly Greatne&s;s to bear their Ma&s;ter's Yoke, and who have learnt of him to be meek and lowly in Heart; who are hearty Foes to Divi&s;ion only, and faithful con&s;tant Friends to Peace and Union. The&s;e are the True Sons of the Church, to u&s;e Mr. <HI>S</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion. For &s;ince the very Spirit and Soul of the Chri&s;tian Religion is the Spirit of Union and Charity, and the Spirit of Divi&s;ion is by con&s;equence the Spirit of Malice and of the Devil; the True Son of the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Church is he who appears the mo&s;t for Union: and a wi&s;e Man may in this ca&s;e find out the Child by the &s;ame Method, by which in another <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;o &s;agaciou&s;ly found out the Mother. For as &s;he was the true Mother who was not for dividing the Child, he is certainly the true Child who is lea&s;t for dividing the Mother.</P>
<P>If then the be&s;t Religion only ought to be tolerated, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> is the be&s;t Religion, and the True Church of <HI>England,</HI> to u&s;e Mr. <HI>S</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion, is only properly the Church; and the moderate part of that Church be only the true Church, as we have endeavoured to &s;hew: and if that violent Party which calls it &s;elf the Church of <HI>England,</HI> differs from the moderate Party more than any other Di&s;&s;enters, becau&s;e they are at a greater di&s;tance from Charity than any other Di&s;&s;enters; why then if Toleration is taken away, it follows that of all the Di&s;&s;enters from the True Church, the violent part of the Church of <HI>England</HI> ought the lea&s;t to be tolerated.</P>
<P>By which, Sir, it appears that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> has been making a Rod for him&s;elf. For if only the True Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> is to remain, and the moderate Church of <HI>England</HI> be the True Church of <HI>England</HI>; if the mo&s;t violent ought the lea&s;t to be tolerated, becau&s;e they are the mo&s;t repug|nant to Charity, and con&s;equently are the mo&s;t enclining to di&s;turb the Publick; why then it evidently follows that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> who is the mo&s;t violent even of the Violent, ought never to be endur'd in a well-order'd State.</P>
<P>For can any thing be more oppo&s;ite to the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, than either his De&s;ign, or his manner of hand|ling it? Is not his De&s;ign apparently to &s;et three Nations at variance? Does not his Stile &s;hew a furious Zealot bent upon embroiling the World? Has he not treated the Di&s;&s;enters
<PB N="12" REF="11">
and tho&s;e of the Church with equal Rancour and Venom? Does he not u&s;e the&s;e well-manner'd and well-natur'd Ex|pre&s;&s;ions to the latter, viz. <HI>Fal&s;e and perfidious Mem|bers, &s;huffling treacherous Latitudinarians, Sots and Bigots, Apo&s;tates and Renegadoes, fal&s;e Traitors, crafty, faithle&s;s, in&s;idious Per&s;ons</HI>; while the gentle&s;t Terms he u&s;es to the others are, <HI>Villains, Swarm of Sectaries, Robbers, Vipers, Boars, Bea&s;ts, Devils, Traitors, Ba&s;tard Spawn of a Po|pi&s;h Party, Propagators of Schi&s;m, and Panders of a cur&s;ed Train, Sharers in Villany and Rebellion.</HI> Is this the Stile of a Chri&s;tian? Is this the Language of Charity, that ne|ver yet was known to revile upon the mo&s;t provoking Trials? The Spirit of the Go&s;pel would have taught him another Strain. The Evangeli&s;ts never u&s;ed any Invective again&s;t <HI>Judas, Pilate,</HI> or any of the Enemies or Execu|tioners of Chri&s;t. And St. <HI>Jude</HI> tells us in his Epi&s;tle, That, Michael <HI>the Archangel, when contending with the De|vil he di&s;puted about the Body of</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>dur&s;t not bring a|gain&s;t him a railing Accu&s;ation, but &s;aid, The Lord rebuke thee.</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, I begin to apprehend, that I &s;hall tire your Patience, and therefore it is high time to proceed to the con&s;ideration of the &s;econd Branch of Mr. <HI>S</HI>'s Propo&s;ition, which follows.</P>
<Q><P>The Peace, Happine&s;s, and Pro&s;perity of the Secular Power depends upon that of the Spiritual and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical.</P>

<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> What is meant by the Secular Power, and its Peace and Pro&s;perity. I mean what is meant among us; for it will be nece&s;&s;ary to apply things, and bring them home to our &s;elves.</ITEM>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By the Secular Power among us may be meant,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Either the whole Legi&s;lative Power, including the King, the Lords, and the Commons, who have Power by the Con&s;ent of the People to enact &s;uch Laws as may augment their Strength, and defend and &s;ecure their Properties. Or by the Secular Power may be meant,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Executive Power alone, or the Power which is lodg'd in the hands of the Sovereign by the Con&s;ent of the People, in order to a due Execution of the Laws which are made for the &s;ecuring their Properties.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Legi&s;lative Power can be meant nothing but the &s;ucce&s;sful obtaining the End for which they a&s;&s;emble, which is the &s;ecuring of Property.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Executive Power, &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from the Legi&s;lative, can be meant nothing but an augmentation of Power, or a Power be|yond what is given by Law and the Con&s;ent of the Peo|ple, and the Enjoyment of that Power unmole&s;ted and undi&s;turb'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What may be meant by the Spiritual and Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Power, and its Peace and Pro&s;perity.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By the Spiritual Power, and its Peace and Pro&s;peri|ty, may be meant the flouri&s;hing of Religion in the World,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
and the prevailing Influence it has over the Minds of Men, and its exertion of that Influence unmole&s;ted and undi|&s;turb'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, as oppos'd to Spiritual, and its Peace and Pro&s;perity, may be meant a Power to do more than is allow'd by Religion, and the Enjoyment of that Power unmole&s;ted and undi&s;turb'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Let us now &s;hew the Dependance that the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Civil Power has upon that of the Spiritual and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Legi&s;lative Power does depend upon the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Spiri|tual Power oppos'd to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; that is, it depends upon the flouri&s;hing of Religion in the World, and the prevailing Influence it has o'er the Minds of Men.</P>
<P>We have taken notice above that the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Legi&s;lative Power means nothing but the &s;ucce&s;sful obtaining the End for which they a&s;|&s;emble, which is the &s;ecuring the Properties of the People. So that in &s;hort, the Pro&s;perity of the Legi&s;lative Power &s;uppo&s;es the flouri&s;hing of the People who are the Foun|tain of it. Now the more prevalent Religion is upon the Minds of a People, the more will the People flouri&s;h; for the more Religion prevails, the more will the Rules of Ju&s;tice be kept inviolate, the more will Peace and Union among them be &s;trengthned; and by con&s;equence, the more &s;ecure will they be from the encroaching Attempts of each other, and the &s;tronger to repel any foreign Force. But from hence it follows that,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Legi&s;lative Power, and by con&s;equence of the whole Body of the People,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
does not depend upon that of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, as it is oppos'd to the Spiritual. Where by Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, I mean the Power of en&s;laving the Con&s;cience, by inflicting Temporal Penalties. For the Clergy, by that Power which they have not from Religion, and which is therefore Secular; by the U&s;urpation, I &s;ay, of &s;uch a Power, they promote Libertini&s;m and Athei&s;tical Principles, and do a great deal of harm to Religion; and &s;o by weakning that which &s;trengthens it, weaken the Legi&s;lative Power. Be&s;ides, the Clergy by the U&s;urpation of &s;uch a Power, not only encroach upon the Legi&s;lative, but run counter to it. For the Legi&s;lative Power is plac'd in &s;uch and &s;uch hands by the Con&s;ent of the People, in order to the main|taining or augmenting the Publick Strength, and the &s;ecur|ing every Man's Property, as long as he does no harm to the Publick, or to particular Per&s;ons. But the Clergy, by the U&s;urpation of this Temporal Power, invade the Proper|ties of innocent People, and by exa&s;perating the Minds of the Sufferers, divide and weaken the Publick Strength.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Power which the Clergy have of Per&s;ecut|ing, mu&s;t be deriv'd from the Whole or a Part of the Le|gi&s;lative. If they derive it only from a Part again&s;t the Con&s;ent of the re&s;t, why then they divide and weaken the Legi&s;lative. If they derive it from the Con&s;ent of the Whole, why then the Legi&s;lative betrays the Tru&s;t which the People repos'd in them, and run counter to the very End of Government, which is the &s;ecuring of Property, and by &s;o doing de&s;troyeth it &s;elf. For this is plain, that wherever there is Per&s;ecution, Property cannot be &s;ecure. For &s;ince Faith or Belief is not in a Man's power, how can any Man be &s;ecure of Property in a Nation where he may lo&s;e it to morrow, for no other rea&s;on than for not believing what he cannot believe?

The Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Executive Power, as it has a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate Intere&s;t from that of the Legi&s;lative, neither does nor can depend upon the Pro&s;peri|ty of the Spiritual Power, that is, upon the flouri&s;hing Force of Religion. For the Power we &s;peak of is a Power beyond what is allow'd by Law, and the Con&s;ent of the Peo|ple. Now the more Virtuous and the more Religious any People are, the le&s;s that People are in danger of Arbitrary Power. 'Tis want ofVirtue that makes Men factious, and nothing but Faction can make any one Arbitrary. For then a Sovereign grows Arbitrary, when a part of his Subjects, on account of their own mi&s;taken Intere&s;t, or violent Re&s;entment, betray the Rights of the re&s;t. But,</P>
<P N="4">4. The Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Executive Power, take it upon a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate Intere&s;t from that of the Legi&s;lative, does often depend upon the Pro&s;perity of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power; that is to &s;ay, the Arbitrary and Ty|rannical Power of the Prince depends upon the illegal im|pious Power of the Prie&s;thood. All Government is cer|tainly both for and from the People, who fir&s;t entred into Civil Society for the defence of their Rights. How then came the People ever to give up tho&s;e Rights, which we &s;ee they have often done, and to depend upon the Arbitrary Will of their Governors, &s;ince it is contrary to the very End for which they entred into Society, and does not fail to bring them into a wor&s;e Condition than the State of Nature? Why the common Method by which Princes obtain unlimited Power, is this: They prevail upon the corrupt part of the Clergy to trump up tho&s;e wretched a|bominable Doctrines of <HI>Jus Divinum,</HI> Non-re&s;i&s;tance, and Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience upon the People; which is as much as to tell them, that if their Sovereign Lord and Ma&s;ter, who is
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Ab&s;olute and Independant, and accountable to none but God, will at any time graciou&s;ly conde&s;cend to do them the honour to lie with any of their Wives or Daughters, they ought mo&s;t ob&s;equiou&s;ly to hold the Door, becau&s;e he has the Power of doing what he plea&s;es from a Right Divine. But if any Man asks this Que&s;tion, How comes it that the Clergy, who are a part of the Collective Body of the People, &s;hould be in&s;trumental in making their Princes Arbitrary, &s;ince in the Peoples Rights they give up their own? I an&s;wer, that the Clergy are not &s;uch Fools, but that in giving up the Peoples Rights they always except their own: Nay, not only that, but in lieu of the Power they convey to the King which he has not by Law, they never fail to &s;tipulate a Power for them&s;elves which they have not by Go&s;pel. If any Man will but ca&s;t his eye over the different Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> he will find that in mo&s;t Dominions where Arbitrary Power prevails, the Tempo|ral Power of the Clergy is great; nay, &s;o great, that at the &s;ame time that they &s;upport a Power in their Kings of cutting the Throats of their People, they re&s;erve to them|&s;elves the Privilege of cutting the Throats of their Kings.</P>
<P>But if at any time it &s;hould happen, which I hope ne|ver will, but which yet is not impo&s;&s;ible, that any part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy &s;hould prove &s;o corrupt, as to enter into the &s;ame Mea&s;ures which divers of them did in &s;ome former Reigns, into Mea&s;ures that had like to have prov'd &s;o fatal to our Con&s;titution, and which, if they &s;hould be taken, are likely to prove more fatal now than ever; I de&s;ire them to con&s;ider, that they have not Empire e|nough o'er the Minds of Men to make their Princes Ar|bitrary, tho perhaps they may have Credit enough to
<PB N="18" REF="17">
throw us into fatal Divi&s;ions, and &s;ubject us to a foreign Power. One of our former Princes was very &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore at the &s;ame time that &s;ome of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> were endeavouring with all their Might to make him ab&s;olute and independant, by preach|ing up Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, Non re&s;i&s;tance, and <HI>Jus Divi|num</HI> upon the People, He, who knew the World very well, and was convinc'd that they had not Authority over the Con&s;ciences and Minds of his Subjects &s;ufficient to do his bu&s;ine&s;s, was undermining them all the while, and in|troducing the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Clergy. For if He grew ab&s;olute, He did not care by what Religion, having more of the Ty|rant in his Humour than the Saint. Tho&s;e whom he un|dermin'd, his Succe&s;&s;or a&s;&s;aulted openly, as little knowing of what Spirit they were. What was the Event? Why, as &s;oon as they &s;aw that the Arbitrary Power which they had been helping him and his Predece&s;&s;or to, extended it &s;elf to them; that not only Toleration was &s;et up, and con&s;e|quently all their Ambition mortified, and their Temporal Power thrown down; but that they were faln into the Snare which them&s;elves had laid; that their Properties and their Privileges were become a Prey to that unbounded Power which they had de&s;ign'd to &s;wallow the Peoples; why then, to the amazement of all the World, they began to &s;peak a Language which they had never been taught, and to cry out aloud, that the King had broken the Contract which he had made with the People; meaning at the &s;ame time the implicit Compact which he had made with them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I di&s;&s;ected this Sophi&s;ter's Propo&s;ition, and endeavoured to &s;hew the Benefit of Religion to Go|vernment and the Mi&s;chief of Prie&s;tcraft. For my own
<PB N="19" REF="18">
part, Sir, at the &s;ame time I am not at all alarm'd about keeping up the Toleration. The Queen has given her Word for maintaining it, which I have no rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t, be|cau&s;e I never knew that &s;he broke it. However, if I am not mi&s;-inform'd, there are Per&s;ons be&s;ides Mr. <HI>S.</HI> who are preparing to have a throw at it, and to do their utmo&s;t Endeavours to take it away, the very Attempt whereof is at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t horrible Wickedne&s;s that can be con|ceiv'd, and the mo&s;t dangerous to Church and State. For the effecting of it would nece&s;&s;arily have the&s;e Con&s;equen|ces: It would weaken the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation among them&s;elves, and by fomenting the Divi&s;ions among us, and exa&s;perat|ing the Minds of the Parties, make us the le&s;s able to carry on the War again&s;t the Enemy of <HI>Europe.</HI> For a Body that is in Convul&s;ions, when it is about to engage, will be more likely to fall foul on it &s;elf than to beat the Enemy.</P>
<P>As the effecting of this De&s;ign would weaken the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o in all likelihood it would quite alienate the <HI>Scots</HI> from us: It would make them believe they have been abus'd and laugh'd at, and the Union from that time would become a general Je&s;t. Now of what con&s;equence the alienating of the Spirits of the <HI>Scots</HI> at &s;uch a juncture as this might be to the Common Intere&s;t, I leave to be deter|min'd by tho&s;e who have the Management of publick Af|fairs.</P>
<P>As the bringing about this De&s;ign would weaken the two Nations by dividing them among them&s;elves and from one another, it would le&s;&s;en the Queen's Reputation at home, and her Credit abroad. For after &s;he had broken her Word with her Subjects in a Ca&s;e of the highe&s;t Import|ance, how could any of the Allies rely upon it, when &s;he
<PB N="20" REF="19">
gives it to them only on the behalf of her Subjects? And this Con&s;ideration makes this Attempt as impudently wick|ed as it is extremely fooli&s;h, becau&s;e all who have any knowledg of the Queen know it will be ab&s;olutely impo&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;hould they effect this De&s;ign, they mu&s;t re|&s;olve either to maintain Per&s;ecution, or to let it fall again. If they re&s;olve to let it fall again, why they will provoke their Enemies to no purpo&s;e, and render them&s;elves ridicu|lous. If they re&s;olve to carry it on, they mu&s;t at the &s;ame time determine to break thro the Act of Settlement: Becau&s;e they know very well that if ever the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;hould come, they would infallibly deliver the Nation from &s;o grievous a Burden.</P>
<P>But let us now &s;hew the Folly and Wickedne&s;s of this Attempt, by di&s;covering the Mi&s;chief which the effecting it would bring to the Church it &s;elf. We have &s;aid before, that to maintain Per&s;ecution they mu&s;t break through the Act of Settlement, an Act which is the Security of this Nation, and of the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI> What may we rea&s;onably believe would follow? Why the next Succe&s;|&s;or would be introduc'd by Men of Arbitrary Principles: For who but Men of &s;uch Principles would break through &s;uch an Act? Now Men of Arbitrary Principles will cer|tainly be for &s;ecuring their Per&s;ons and their Power. But the only way for Men who act like them, to &s;ecure both, will be to make their new Monarch as Arbitrary as they can. Well then! they will make u&s;e of any Method that will be&s;t conduce to that; and con&s;equently of any Reli|gion. But the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion will be of more u&s;e to them in the accompli&s;hment of their De&s;igns than the Reformed can be, for Rea&s;ons too well known to be in&s;erted here;
<PB N="21" REF="20">
and therefore to compa&s;s it they will &s;et up Toleration a|new, and expo&s;e the Church to the united Fury of Papi&s;ts and Di&s;&s;enters, and its too ea&s;y Clergy to the ju&s;t deri&s;ion of the Reformed Churches abroad.</P>
<P>However vi&s;ionary the&s;e Notions may &s;eem to the vio|lent part of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> yet the Impartial World need not be told that this is not the fir&s;t time that they have been making Rods for them&s;elves. For let any one among them an&s;wer to this: If the Do|ctrines of <HI>Jus Divinum,</HI> of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, and of Non-re&s;i&s;tance, Doctrines which they preach'd up with &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s, with &s;o much Zeal, had pa&s;s'd upon the credulous Nation, where now had been the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> 'Tis well they had wi&s;er Men to take care of them, wi&s;er I mean in the Affairs of the World; for in &s;hort they ought not to pry into Matters of State. They have an Employment of a larger Extent, and of a much nobler Con&s;equence; and they mu&s;t needs prove ill Politicians, if they are good Prie&s;ts. But however, we have this Comfort at pre&s;ent, that there are two invincible Ob&s;tacles to the effecting of this De&s;ign. The one is the unblemi&s;h'd Honour of the Queen, the other the Honour of the approaching Parliament, in which I know there are &s;o many Members of unalterable un&s;haken Principles; &s;o many Members, to &s;ay all in a word, &s;o exactly re&s;embling your &s;elf, that no Con&s;ideration can e'er prevail upon them to break thro &s;o excellent a Con&s;titution, and to betray the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them: I &s;ay, no Con&s;ideration can e'er prevail upon them to make the Majority of that Peo|ple mi&s;erable, for who&s;e Pro&s;perity they were &s;ent to con|&s;ult; nor to e&s;tabli&s;h an Inqui&s;ition in <HI>England,</HI> which may fall heavy upon their deare&s;t Friends, nay and perhaps too upon them&s;elves. For &s;ince no Man's Belief is within his
<PB N="22" REF="21">
own power, they them&s;elves may perhaps be hereafter in|volv'd in the Penalties which they ordain. Or if them&s;elves &s;hould not be, their Po&s;terity probably may; and they are too con&s;iderate to give a ju&s;t occa&s;ion to their Children or Grandchildren to cur&s;e their Memories for making a Law which mu&s;t render their innocent Lives unhappy. Be&s;ides, they have Wi&s;dom enough to know that no Op|po&s;ition can &s;tifle Truth, and that Indulgence is the &s;ure&s;t and noble&s;t Method of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Error.</P>
<P>To conclude, I am very far from having any prejudice to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I honour and e&s;teem the mo|derate part of it, but cannot for my life e&s;teem the violent in any Religion whatever. Nor can I think I am much to blame: For &s;hall a little rakelly Par&s;on be ju&s;tly reputed &s;candalous for open Drunkenne&s;s and Fornication, and &s;hall He be accounted venerable who&s;e every Action &s;hews want of Charity, which is downright Antichri&s;tian? For this is plain, that Fornication and Drunkenne&s;s, tho crying Sins of them&s;elves, yet are le&s;s damnable than Murder. Now being out of Charity is Murder, if we will believe St. <HI>John,</HI> 1 Epi&s;t. 3. 15. <HI>Who&s;oever hateth his Brother is a Murderer.</HI> The Rea&s;on is plain: He who hates his Bro|ther would kill him, if he were not re&s;train'd by Law. For Mankind can have but two Re&s;traints upon them, Religion and Law. But the Chri&s;tian who hates his Bro|ther is not re&s;train'd by Religion, becau&s;e if he were, he would not hate him. Yet after all, the only Harm that I wi&s;h, even to the violent part of the Clergy, is, that like our Kings they may be re&s;train'd from the doing Mi&s;chief, and confin'd to the doing Good. I am,</P>
