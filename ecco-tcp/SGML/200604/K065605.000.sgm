<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Cambridge,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 10. 1734.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am one of tho&s;e many per&s;ons in this Univer&s;ity, who have profited by your learned writings, and who greatly admire the depth of thought, the force of rea&s;on, and the per&s;picuity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion that generally appears in them; I cannot but be extremely &s;urprized and con|cerned, that a Gentleman of your abilities &s;hould have taken &s;o much pains not only to depreciate one of the noble&s;t of all the &s;ciences, but to di&s;parage, to traduce, and even to defame a &s;et of learned men, who&s;e labours &s;o greatly conduce to the honour of this i&s;land, and to the general good of man|kind.
<PB N="6" REF="9">
You will ea&s;ily &s;ee that I &s;peak of Mathematicks, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mathemati|cians, and of the manner in which you have been plea&s;ed to treat them in your late pam|phlet, intitled, <HI>The Analy&s;t.</HI> That di&s;cour&s;e, it is true, is &s;eemingly directed to one per|&s;on only; but you are not got through your fir&s;t &s;ection, before you &s;peak of <HI>too many more of the like character</HI> with him; and in the con|tents to that very &s;ection, as well as in all the re&s;t of your di&s;cour&s;e, you talk of Ma|thematicians in &s;o general a manner, that I am afraid your readers will think very few, if any, of tho&s;e Gentlemen are to be ex|cepted out of that number, again&s;t which you bring &s;o heavy a charge.</P>
<P>This charge, Sir, con&s;i&s;ts of three prin|cipal points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of infidelity with regard to the Chri|&s;tian Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of endeavouring to make others Infi|dels, and &s;ucceeding in tho&s;e endeavours by means of <HI>the deference</HI> which is paid <HI>to their judgment, as being pre&s;umed to be of all men the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea|&s;on.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Of error and fal&s;e rea&s;oning in their own &s;cience.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
This, Sir, is the charge you have been plea&s;ed to bring again&s;t our Mathematici|ans, and I intend particularly to examine with what rea&s;on and truth you have done &s;o. But before I do this, I mu&s;t beg leave to make a few ob&s;ervations upon the intent and de&s;ign of your treati&s;e, the advantage to be expected from it, the prudence, and ju&s;tice and honour of this de&s;ign; and after that to inquire whether the motive to your writing it were really what you pretend and avow.</P>
<P>If your de&s;ign were to be gue&s;&s;ed at from your Title-page, wherein you profe&s;s to <HI>ex|amine, whether the object, principles and infe|rences of the modern Analy&s;is are more di&s;tinctly conceived, or more evidently deduced, than re|ligious my&s;teries and points of faith,</HI> one would be apt to conclude your intent was to &s;hew, that the my&s;teries of Religion might be as clearly conceived, as the object and princi|ples of the modern Analy&s;is; and that the &s;everal points of our Faith might be as evi|dently deduced, as the inferences of that Analy&s;is are from its principles; or, in other words, that you were about to give us a Mathematical demon&s;tration, or one of equal clearne&s;s and certainty, of the truth of the
<PB N="8" REF="11">
Chri&s;tian Religion. This, I &s;ay, from the words of your Title-page one would natu|rally take to be your de&s;ign: but it is &s;o far from being &s;o, that throughout your whole di&s;cour&s;e, though addre&s;&s;ed to an <HI>Infidel Ma|thematician,</HI> I do not find the lea&s;t attempt towards e&s;tabli&s;hing the evidence of our Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>I find therefore no other way of recon|ciling your Title-page with the &s;ub&s;tance of your di&s;cour&s;e, than by &s;uppo&s;ing you pre|tend to prove, that the object, principles, and inferences of the modern Analy&s;is are not more di&s;tinctly conceived, nor more evi|dently deduced, than religious My&s;teries and point of Faith, <HI>i. e.</HI> that there is no more evidence and certainty in the modern Ana|ly&s;is, than in the Chri&s;tian Religion. But how far you do honour to Chri&s;tianity, by entering into a compari&s;on between the evi|dence and certainty of the Religion taught us by our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles, and the evidence and certainty of the doctrine of Fluxions delivered by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and his followers, a doctrine in your opinion, <HI>full of error, fal&s;e rea&s;oning, manife&s;t &s;ophi&s;ins, fallacious and incon&s;i&s;tent ways of arguing, &s;uch as would not be allowed of in Divinity,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
I &s;hall leave to your brethren the Divines to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Not to in&s;i&s;t therefore too long upon this, I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s your Title-page, and &s;hall come to your declared and avowed de&s;ign, which, it mu&s;t be owned, you have &s;teadily pur&s;ued through your whole di&s;cour&s;e; to le&s;&s;en the reputation and authority of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and his followers, by &s;hewing that they are not &s;uch <HI>great ma&s;ters of rea|&s;on,</HI> as they are generally pre&s;umed to be; and to depreciate the &s;cience they profe&s;s, by demon&s;trating to the world that it is not of that clearne&s;s and certainty, as is com|monly imagined.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e us, Sir, if this de&s;ign appears a very &s;trange one to us of the Uni|ver&s;ity, who plainly &s;ee of how great u&s;e Mathematical Learning is to mankind, not only to tho&s;e who make it a part of their &s;tudies, but to all the re&s;t of the world, who without knowing any thing of Mathema|ticks, do yet daily and hourly reap the be|nefit of the inventions of Mathematical men in all parts of life, e&s;pecially in Me|chanical arts, in Architecture, Civil, Naval, and Military, and in Navigation, upon which the pro&s;perity and &s;ecurity of this Nation &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="13">
much depends. Though we &s;ee and know, that the &s;tudy of Mathematicks flouri&s;hes among us, as much as in any part of the world; and that our youth have as good a&s;&s;i&s;tance and opportunities for cultivating that &s;cience, as are any where to be met with; yet we are far from thinking that too many of our &s;tudents engage in this pur&s;uit, or &s;pend too much of their time in it. Be|lieve me, Sir, the generality of youth have more need of the &s;pur than the bridle, when they are to enter upon a &s;tudy, that requires &s;o laborious an attention, and &s;o con&s;tant an application. Why then, would we ask, is the &s;tudy of Mathematicks to be di&s;couraged and undervalued? What could be the rea&s;on or motive for your engaging in &s;uch a de&s;ign?</P>
<P>I perceive your an&s;wer is ready. Ma|thematicians are Infidels, and make u&s;e of their reputation and authority, as being e&s;teemed <HI>the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of rea&s;on,</HI> to pervert other per&s;ons to infidelity. Really, Sir, this a&s;&s;ertion of yours is new to us, and extremely &s;urprizes us. We &s;ee nothing of it here, and cannot ea&s;ily believe it is &s;o any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
But admitting it for the pre&s;ent to be true; have you well con&s;idered whether it be for the advantage of Chri&s;tianity, to pub|li&s;h to the world, that a numerous &s;et of learned men, and of &s;uch learned men as are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> p. 4.</NOTE> <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed to apprehend more di&s;tinctly, con|&s;ider more clo&s;ely, infer more ju&s;tly, conclude more accurately than other men,</HI> do not believe the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion? This, methinks, is an a&s;&s;ertion fitter for an <HI>Alci|phron,</HI> or a <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> to make, than for a Chri&s;tian Divine. <HI>Tell it not in Gath, pub|li&s;h it not in the &s;treets of Askalon.</HI> Though the evidence and certainty of our holy Re|ligion is &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, as not to be &s;haken by the arguments, much le&s;s by the reputation and authority of any unbelievers what&s;oever; yet, I am afraid, it would be a great &s;tumbling block to men of weak heads, if they were made to believe, that the ju&s;te&s;t and clo&s;e&s;t rea&s;oners were gene|rally Infidels. You know, Sir, it was a &s;hrewd objection, tho' by no means a valid or conclu&s;ive one, that was made again&s;t our Saviour. <HI>Have any of the High Prie&s;ts, or of the Phari&s;ees</HI> (the men of greate&s;t learn|ing, and e&s;teemed the <HI>greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea|&s;on</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="15">
in tho&s;e days) <HI>believed in him?</HI> And if there were any room to renew this objecti|on in our days, as con&s;idering the piety and zeal of the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts of all degrees, and their con&s;tant and &s;incere attachment to the intere&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Religion and to nothing el&s;e, &s;urely there is not, it would indeed be a very perplexing one.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould now make you a farther conce&s;&s;ion, and &s;uppo&s;e it not only to be true, but to be publickly and notoriou&s;ly known, that the body of our Mathematici|ans are Infidels and enemies to Chri&s;tianity, what think you is the method to be taken? What other, you will &s;ay, but to ruin the reputation of our adver&s;aries? If we cannot attack them in their lives and con|ver&s;ations, we mu&s;t at lea&s;t endeavour to &s;hew that they are de&s;titute of learning and rea&s;on. This will le&s;&s;en their authority a|mong the people, will prevent their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> p. 3.</NOTE> <HI>mi&s;lead|ing unwary per&s;ons in matters of the highe&s;t concernment,</HI> and will take off <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 4.</NOTE> <HI>that bia&s;s and deference for their judgment,</HI> which cau&s;es weak <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>minds to &s;ubmit to their deci&s;ions, where they have no right to decide.</HI> Why really, Sir, this may do very well, if you are &s;ure
<PB N="13" REF="16">
of &s;ucceeding in your attempt. At lea&s;t it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that you do <HI>&s;tare &s;uper vias antiquas.</HI> This is the very me|thod which the <HI>Odium Theologicum,</HI> the in|temperate zeal of Divines has always pur|&s;ued, and has practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s for many ages. But I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that it is a very different cour&s;e from what was taken by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles on the like occa&s;ion. <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,</HI> &s;ays our Saviour, <HI>that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes.</HI> And after his ex|ample, the great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, though he was fully &s;en&s;ible of the oppo&s;i|tion he met with in preaching the Go&s;pel, from the <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;ophers; yet did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to enter the li&s;ts with the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Plato</HI> and the Stoicks, and to &s;hew that they did not under&s;tand Geome|try or Philo&s;ophy; in order to le&s;&s;en their reputation, and thereby to take off from the weight of their oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;tianity. He contents him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that <HI>not many wi&s;e, not many learned are called</HI>; though <HI>the Greeks &s;eek after wi&s;dom,</HI> though <HI>Chri&s;t crucified is unto the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="17">
yet <HI>the wi&s;dom of this world is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God.</HI> Many more pa&s;&s;ages may be found in his Epi&s;tles to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, that neither our Saviour, nor his Apo&s;tles, who were guided by his Holy Spirit, denied either wi&s;dom, or prudence, or learning to &s;uch unbeliev|ers as were really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e quali|ties: they well knew there was nothing to fear, that <HI>there was no inchantment again&s;t Jacob, nor divination again&s;t I&s;rael,</HI> and that no human abilities or accompli&s;hments what&s;oever could be able to with&s;tand the Divine authority, and the irre&s;i&s;tible evi|dence of the Religion they taught and de|fended.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid perhaps, this is too great a pattern for you to follow; though there was no fear that the abilities, the reputa|tion and authority of any adver&s;aries what|&s;oever could with&s;tand our Saviour or his Apo&s;tles; yet what was no match for them, may po&s;&s;ibly be too hard for you, unle&s;s you take proper means to prevent it. How, Sir! Has not our Saviour promi&s;ed <HI>to be with you unto the end of the world?</HI> Has he not a&s;&s;ured us, that even <HI>the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t his Church?</HI> After this de|claration,

<P>Surely no man will think this too labo|rious a task for the zeal and piety of the Chri&s;tian Clergy to undertake, if the &s;alva|tion of &s;ouls depends upon it.

You, Sir, have already &s;hewn them how ea&s;ily this is to be done; &s;ince notwith&s;tanding your many and great avocations, both at home and in very di&s;tant regions, you have not only made your &s;elf ma&s;ter of the mo&s;t profound, the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and mo&s;t difficult parts of that &s;tudy; but by looking clo&s;er and more atten|tively into them than any body has ever done before you, have di&s;covered their mo&s;t &s;ecret defects, and have unravelled their mo&s;t hid|den and intricate fallacies.

<P>Now therefore, Sir, we come to our main and principal point, to examine by what means, in order to prevent the danger that Chri&s;tianity is threatened with from our Ma|thematical Infidels, you propo&s;e to le&s;&s;en their reputation, and to &s;hew that they are not &s;uch ju&s;t and clo&s;e rea&s;oners as is com|monly imagined. I &s;hall prove, &s;ay you, that the method of Fluxions invented by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> and implicitly received by all our Mathematicians, is built upon fal&s;e and precatious principles.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">
This will do &s;omething, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in as much as it will &s;hew, that Mathema|ticians are men and liable to error. But if they are mi&s;taken in thinking the method of Fluxions to be a &s;ound and ju&s;t one, will it follow from this, that in all the other parts of their &s;cience they do not rea&s;on ju&s;tly and accurately? You know very well, Sir, that Fluxions are of very late invention, and that though they are a noble and u&s;eful part of Mathematicks, yet the whole of Mathe|maticks does not con&s;i&s;t in Fluxions. Ma|thematicians were always reckoned to be <HI>great ma&s;ters of rea&s;on,</HI> before Fluxions were invented. And as the u&s;e of Fluxions does by no means &s;uper&s;ede the doctrine of Geo|metry delivered by <HI>Euclid, Apollonius,</HI> and &s;o many others of the great ma&s;ters both an|tient and modern, not to mention Algebra and all the other parts of the Mathematicks, again&s;t which you make no objection; will it not follow that Mathematicians are &s;till to be e&s;teemed ju&s;t and accurate rea&s;oners, though they have been led into &s;ome mi|&s;takes in the method of Fluxions, by their implicit deference to the judgment of the Great Author of that invention?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">
But farther, if it &s;hould appear that there is no mi&s;take in that method, that the ob|ject of it is clearly conceived, that its prin|ciples are evident and certain, that the infe|rences drawn from them are ju&s;tly deduced, that the whole doctrine is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a clear, ju&s;t, and &s;olid foundation, and that it is you only who have been guilty of a mo&s;t inexcu&s;able over&s;ight, in which the meane&s;t Mathematician you could have con&s;ulted, would have immediately &s;et you right: what then will become of your noble and well concerted project to le&s;&s;en the reputation of Mathematicians for the &s;ervice of Chri&s;tia|nity?</P>
<P>Believe me, Sir, our holy Religion &s;tands in need of no &s;uch attempts to &s;erve it. <HI>Non tali auxilio, nec defen&s;oribus i&s;tis.</HI> The bet|ter rea&s;oners either Mathematicians, or any other &s;ort of men &s;hall be, the more likely will they be to embrace truth wherever it &s;hall be found, and con&s;equently the more likely to receive the truth and undoubted evi|dence of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>But pray, Sir, was it really and indeed the intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity, and nothing el&s;e, that prompted you to this undertaking? Was that your only motive? The rea&s;on of my doubt
<PB N="21" REF="24">
is, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who by your own acknowledgment was not an Infidel, is no more &s;pared in your performance, nay on the contrary is more &s;everely handled than any of his followers, whom you &s;uppo&s;e to be In|fidels. For be&s;ides the charge brought again&s;t him and them in common, of the <HI>want of good Geometry and good Logic, of error and fal&s;e rea&s;oning,</HI> you frequently repre&s;ent him as <HI>con&s;cious of the defect of his principles,</HI> and yet endeavouring to impo&s;e upon and to mi&s;lead his followers <HI>by &s;hifts, artifice and &s;ubtilty, by ambiguous terms, by puzzling, palliating and fallacious ways of proceeding,</HI> &amp;c. that is, you repre&s;ent them only as weak men, de|ceived and impo&s;ed upon; but him both as a weak and an ill man; as not only de|ceived, but a deceiver and an impo&s;tor. Did zeal for Chri&s;tianity move you to this? To treat in this manner a per&s;on whom you ac|knowledge to have been a believer of the Chri&s;tian Religion? I am afraid we mu&s;t look out for &s;ome other motive, and in order to di&s;cover it, I &s;hall take the liberty of con|&s;idering a little what has been your conduct with regard to Mathematicians, not only &s;ince you have been informed of their being Infidels, but five and twenty years ago, when
<PB N="22" REF="25">
it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed you had heard and &s;een le&s;s of them, than you have lately done.</P>
<P>About that time you publi&s;hed an <HI>E&s;&s;ay towards a new Theory of Vi&s;ion,</HI> wherein you were plea&s;ed to in&s;ert a great many &s;evere cen&s;ures upon Mathematicians, relating to their ignorance of the fundamental principles of their own &s;cience. Had you then heard of their being Infidels? If &s;o, why were many of tho&s;e cen&s;ures greatly mollified, upon farther con&s;ideration, in a new edition of that piece publi&s;hed the la&s;t year? And how comes a new charge of ignorance to be brought again&s;t them, on another ac|count, at this time? Really, Sir, I can no way a&s;cribe all this to a zeal for Chri&s;tia|nity: but, if I may be allowed to make one hypothe&s;is, it will then be ea&s;y to account clearly and di&s;tinctly for every particular of your conduct. It is briefly this, that you have too great an opinion of your &s;elf, and too mean a one of all other men. Hence, not content with the reputation you have de&s;ervedly acquired of being a clear and ju&s;t rea&s;oner, you can never re&s;t, unle&s;s you con|vince the world that all tho&s;e, who have hitherto been e&s;teemed the <HI>greate&s;t ma&s;ters</HI>

Were the&s;e Gentlemen all unbelie|vers? Your&s;elf will not call them &s;o; and if we except one, you will not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect them to be &s;o. Why then are they all attacked in your writings? I cannot po&s;|&s;ibly &s;urmi&s;e any other cau&s;e, but that they are all e&s;teemed <HI>great ma&s;ters of rea&s;on,</HI> and that you are di&s;po&s;ed to le&s;&s;en their reputa|tion in order to exalt your own. Two of them you have been plea&s;ed to charge with contradiction, gro&s;s, apparent, glaring con|tradiction, &s;uch as were utterly unpardon|able in a man who makes the lea&s;t pretence to rea&s;oning; &s;uch as no body could po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect in tho&s;e great men, who had not a much greater opinion of his own abilities
<PB N="24" REF="27">
than of theirs; &s;uch as no man who had the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t or diffidence of him&s;elf, could ever imagine them to be guilty of. I would &s;ay, Sir, that had you &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;|&s;ible for your &s;elf ever to fall into any mi|&s;take; you would certainly, when you ima|gined Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> to have &s;o manife&s;tly contradicted them&s;elves, have looked over tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of their writings a &s;econd time; you would have done this coolly, attentively and con&s;iderately; and had you done &s;o, you would have found your &s;elf in a gro&s;s, evident mi&s;take; and would have &s;een them to be clearly and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves. I mu&s;t take leave to add, that your not doing &s;o, does evidently prove the truth of the hypothe&s;is I laid down but now, that you have too good an opinion of your &s;elf, and too mean a one of tho&s;e great men. One of the&s;e I &s;hall of cour&s;e be led to vindicate in the pur&s;uit of my de&s;ign; and as your mi&s;take about the other has a near relation to Geo|metry, before I clo&s;e this letter, I &s;hall take up a little of your time in rectifying that likewi&s;e.</P>

follow that you, who are at a lo&s;s to con|duct your &s;elves, cannot with any decen|cy &s;et up for guides to other men. The main point in the method of Fluxions is to obtain the fluxion or momentum of the rectangle or product of two indeter|minate quantities. Ina&s;much as from thence are derived rules for obtaining the Fluxions of all other products and powers; be the coefficients or the indexes what they will, integers or fractions, ra|tional or &s;urd. Now this fundamental point one would think &s;hould be very clearly made out, con&s;idering how much is built upon it, and that its influence extends throughout the whole Analy&s;is.

<P>Now, Sir, I would humbly beg leave to inquire of you, who &s;ee &s;o much more clearly into the&s;e matters than Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> or any of his followers; which of the&s;e two Quantities, <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA</HI> &plus; <HI>ab</HI> and <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA</HI> &minus; <HI>ab,</HI> you will be plea&s;ed to call the moment of the rectangle <HI>AB</HI>? <HI>The</HI>

<HI>ca&s;e indeed is difficult,</HI> The difference be|tween them is no le&s;s than 2<HI>ab,</HI> ju&s;t the double of that &s;ame <HI>ab,</HI> which has given us all &s;o much trouble; and yet each of them plead an equal right to the title of moment. So equal a one, that, though I am very &s;en&s;ible of your <HI>addre&s;s and skill,</HI> yet there &s;eems to be no po&s;&s;ibility of deciding the controver&s;y between them <HI>by legitimate rea&s;oning.</HI> I &s;ee but two ways of doing it. One is that they &s;hould to&s;s up cro&s;s or pile for the title: Or if that be thought too boy|i&s;h and unbe&s;eeming the Gravity of Mathe|matical quantities, they mu&s;t even end the di&s;pute in an amicable manner, and without claiming any preference one of another, a|gree that they make two moments between them. Then, Sir, I apprehend the ca&s;e will &s;tand thus: <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA</HI> &plus; <HI>ab</HI> &plus; <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA</HI> &minus; <HI>ab</HI> making twice the moment of the rectangle <HI>AB</HI>; it follows that <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA</HI> will make the &s;ingle moment of the &s;ame rectangle.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, after all the pains you have taken, this affair comes out, even upon your own conce&s;&s;ions, ju&s;t as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and his followers would have it. Believe me, there is no remedy. You mu&s;t acquie&s;ce.
<PB N="47" REF="50">
Only, if it may be any Satisfaction to you to know why Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> took this indirect way of finding the increment of <GAP DESC="math">, in&s;tead of proceeding directly to find the moment of the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> I &s;hall be ready to oblige you as far as can be expected from one of tho&s;e, who <HI>have &s;hown them&s;elves more eager in applying his method, than accurate in examining his prin|ciples.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The final cau&s;e or motive to this proceeding,</HI> I find, is not unknown to you; you &s;ay <HI>it is very obvious,</HI> meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, that thereby it was intended to exclude this &s;ame trouble&s;ome rectangle <HI>ab.</HI> Why truly, Sir, in a book of &s;trict demon&s;tration, as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> intended his <HI>Principia</HI> &s;hould be, it was certainly more proper to exclude that quantity, &s;o as not to &s;uffer it to ap|pear, than fir&s;t to introduce it into the rea|der's view and then to reject it.</P>
<P>You add that <HI>it is not &s;o obvious or ea&s;y to explain a ju&s;t and legitimate rea&s;on for it, or &s;hew it to be Geometrical.</HI> How far it may be obvious or ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign &s;uch a rea&s;on, I will not di&s;pute: though I am apt to think that what is ea&s;y to me, cannot be difficult to other per&s;ons, provided they

<P>You know very well that the moment of the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> is proportional to the ve|locity of that rectangle, with which it alters, either in increa&s;ing, or in dimini&s;hing.

whi&s;per me, that the velocity I &s;eek for, is neither the one nor the other of the&s;e, but is the velocity which the flowing rect|angle has, not while it is greater or le&s;s than <HI>AB,</HI> neither before, nor after it be|comes <HI>AB,</HI> but at that very in&s;tant of time that it is <HI>AB.</HI> In like manner the mo|ment of this rectangle is neither the in|crement from <HI>AB</HI> to <GAP DESC="math">; nor is it the decrement from <HI>AB</HI> to <GAP DESC="math">: It is not a moment com|mon to <HI>AB</HI> and <GAP DESC="math">, which may be con&s;idered as the increment of the former, or as the decrement of the latter: Nor is it a moment common to <HI>AB</HI> and <GAP DESC="math">, which may be con&s;idered as the decrement of the fir&s;t, or as the increment of the la&s;t: But it is the moment of the very individual rect|angle <HI>AB</HI> it&s;elf, and peculiar to that on|ly; and &s;uch as being con&s;idered indiffe|rently either as an increment or decrement, &s;hall be exactly and perfectly the &s;ame.

<P>What &s;ay you, Sir? Is this <HI>a ju&s;t and le|gitimate rea&s;on</HI> for Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s proceeding as he did? I think you mu&s;t acknowledge it to be &s;o.

I think likewi&s;e you cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of great want of caution in your own proceeding; ina&s;much as that quantity, which Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> through this whole Lemma, and all the &s;everal ca&s;es of it, con&s;tantly calls a moment, without confining it to be either increment or. decrement, is by you incon|&s;iderately, and arbitrarily, and without any &s;hadow of rea&s;on given, &s;uppo&s;ed and de|termined

to be an increment. And this, Sir, naturally leads me to give you a piece of friendly advice, which you &s;eem to &s;tand much in need of. It is that, whenever you take it into your head to critici&s;e upon Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s writings, you fir&s;t examine and weigh every word he u&s;es; and if you tran&s;late him, keep clo&s;ely to his expre&s;&s;ion. Believe me, this Great Man, among his o|ther extraordinary indowments, had a pecu|liar &s;agacity in fore&s;eeing objections, as well as an aver&s;ion to di&s;puting. To the&s;e two qualities accompanied with extreme huma|nity and conde&s;cen&s;ion it is owing, that he u&s;es &s;uch accuracy in his expre&s;&s;ion, that an intelligent and attentive reader can ne|ver mi&s;take him; and that he does of him|&s;elf fir&s;t propo&s;e, and then remove &s;uch difficulties, as may naturally ari&s;e in the minds of even candid and judicious per&s;ons, who are not yet ma&s;ters of the &s;ubject he treats of. But as for the <HI>Homines &s;tolidi &amp; ad depugnandum parati,</HI> he contents him&s;elf with ob&s;erving that prudent caution in eve|ry word he u&s;es, that as they &s;hall find no|thing to mi&s;lead them, &s;o on the other hand, if they unde&s;ervedly and unadvi&s;edly attack him, they &s;hall certainly and una|voidably

<P>This great example, which in any the lowe&s;t degree to imitate is the highe&s;t ho|nour I can ever arrive at, or even de&s;ire, moves me to propo&s;e and remove an objec|tion which may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e in your mind, and hinder you from acquie&s;cing in one part of what I have ju&s;t now laid before you. It is that I have &s;uppo&s;ed the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> extended to the middle of its moment; as having acquired the one half of it, and being about to acquire the other; or as having lo&s;t one half of it, and being about to lo&s;e the other. You may &s;ay this is &s;trictly and exactly true in re&s;pect of the &s;ides of that rectangle; which &s;ides, from <HI>A</HI> &minus; &frac12;<HI>a</HI> and <HI>B</HI> &minus; &frac12;<HI>b,</HI> are become <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI>; and are about to become <HI>A</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>a</HI> and <HI>B</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>b</HI>: but that it is not equally true of the rectangle compo&s;ed of tho&s;e &s;ides, which from <GAP DESC="math">, or <HI>AB</HI> &minus; &frac12;<HI>aB</HI> &minus; &frac12;<HI>bA</HI> &plus; &frac14; <HI>ab,</HI> is be|come <HI>AB</HI>; and is about to become <GAP DESC="math">, or <HI>AB</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>aB</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>bA</HI> &plus; &frac14;<HI>ab</HI>: &s;ince the part of the moment which <HI>AB</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have

gained, namely &frac12;<HI>aB</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>bA</HI> &minus; &frac14;<HI>ab,</HI> is not equal to that part of the moment which is about to be gained, namely &frac12;<HI>aB</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>bA</HI> &plus; &frac14;<HI>ab</HI>; the difference between them being &frac12;<HI>ab.</HI> In an&s;wer to this I reply, that the&s;e two quantities, &frac12;<HI>aB</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>bA</HI> &minus; &frac14;<HI>ab,</HI> and &frac12;<HI>aB</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>bA</HI> &plus; &frac14;<HI>ab,</HI> &s;o long as <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are fi|nite quantities, are undoubtedly unequal; but that the more <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are dimini&s;hed, by &s;o much nearer will the&s;e quantities ap|proach to an equality; and if <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are dimini&s;hed <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> the two quantities will then be perfectly equal.

<P>La&s;tly, to remove all &s;cruple and difficul|ty about this affair, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the moment of the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> deter|mined by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> namely <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA,</HI> and the increment of the &s;ame rectan|gle, determined by your&s;elf, namely <HI>aB</HI> &plus; <HI>bA</HI> &plus; <HI>ab,</HI> are perfectly and exactly equal, &s;up|po&s;ing <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> to be dimini&s;hed <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; and this by the <HI>Lemma</HI> ju&s;t now quoted.</P>

as the &s;ame quantity under diffe|rent circum&s;tances; &s;ometimes as in the point of beginning to exi&s;t, and other times as in the point of cea&s;ing to exi&s;t. From this methinks it &s;hould follow that the two ex|pre&s;&s;ions &s;ubjoined, will be perfectly equi|valent to each other.</P>

<P>The meaning of the fir&s;t can po&s;&s;ibly be no other than to con&s;ider the fir&s;t propor|tion between the na&s;cent augments, in the point of their beginning to exi&s;t.

<P N="3">3. Arts and fallacies u&s;ed by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> to make his fal&s;e rea&s;oning pa&s;s up|on his followers.</P>
<P>On this head I &s;hall not need to take up much of your time, becau&s;e having alrea|dy fully proved that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> was not guilty of fal&s;e rea&s;oning in the in&s;tances you alledge, I &s;uppo&s;e no body will think he had any occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of arts and fallacies to impo&s;e upon his followers. But you have one ob&s;ervation upon this head, which is &s;o very &s;ingular, that I cannot but think it worthy of particular con&s;ideration. <HI>Con&s;idering,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annaly&s;t</HI> p. 27.</NOTE> &s;ay you, <HI>the various arts and devices u&s;ed by the Great Author of the Flux|ionary method: in how many lights he placeth his Fluxions: and in what different ways he</HI>

<HI>attempts to demon&s;trate the &s;ame point: one would be inclined to think he was him&s;elf &s;u&s;pi|cious of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his own demon&s;trations: and that he was not enough plea&s;ed with any one notion &s;teadily to adhere to it. Thus much at lea&s;t is plain, that he owned him&s;elf &s;atis|fied concerning certain points, which neverthe|le&s;s he could not undertake to demon&s;trate to o|thers.</HI> Really, Sir, this &s;eems to be very hard u&s;age. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has made a new and great di&s;covery, by which he has not only out-done all the Geometricians that ever went before him, but can enable &s;uch ordi|nary proficients in Mathematicks, as you and I, to &s;urpa&s;s all the great ma&s;ters of antiquity: He is &s;o good as to in&s;truct us in this method; and becau&s;e it requires &s;ome pains and di&s;cernment to comprehend it rightly, he &s;ets it in &s;everal various lights, that by means of &s;ome of the&s;e we may not fail of under&s;tanding it. Pray, Sir, have you and I any rea&s;on to complain of this? For my part, I think my&s;elf greatly obliged to him for his conde&s;cen&s;ion: If he had not taken &s;o much pains to explain his doctrine, I doubt I &s;hould never have under&s;tood it. But, for God's &s;ake, what is it you are offended at, who do not &s;till
<PB N="60" REF="63">
under&s;tand him! You are all in the dark, and yet are angry at his giving you &s;o much light. Surely the fault is not in Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> but in your own eyes.</P>

<P>But is not he <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> &s;ay you, <HI>&s;u&s;picious of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his own demon&s;trations?</HI></P>
<P>Pray, Sir, when a Divine is in&s;tructing his hearers in a weighty and important point of Religion, if from a de&s;ire that every one &s;hould perfectly under&s;tand him, he is at the pains to u&s;e &s;everal arguments, and to &s;et his Doctrine in various lights; would it be rea&s;onable, or ju&s;t, or grateful in any of his auditors to infer from this, that the Preacher was &s;u&s;picious of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his own rea&s;oning? When you, after all the demon&s;trations that had been given of the being of a God, by the learned Fathers of the Church, and by the wi&s;e&s;t of the Phi|lo&s;ophers of all ages, thought fit to in|troduce that new and &s;ingular one of a <HI>Vi&s;ual Language,</HI> would it be fair in me to &s;uppo&s;e that you were &s;u&s;picious of all the
<PB N="61" REF="64">
former proofs of the exi&s;tence of a Deity, and left that great and important truth to depend upon a metaphorical argument? Surely one argument may be ju&s;t, and con|clu&s;ive, and perfectly &s;atisfactory to him that u&s;es it; and yet the matter treated of may be of that difficulty, or of that dignity and importance, as not only to admit of, but to require &s;everal others for the in&s;truc|tion and conviction of his hearers. And thus much may &s;uffice for your third and la&s;t head of objections again&s;t Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and his followers: Only before I conclude I mu&s;t advi&s;e you to correct one word in your extract from his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t.</HI> p. 27.</NOTE> Letter to Mr. <HI>Collins, Nov.</HI> 8, 1676. or rather to give up that extract intirely, as being of no man|ner of &s;ervice to you. There is a great deal of difference between &s;aying I cannot undertake to prove a thing, and I will not undertake it. Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> in that Letter &s;ays, I will not: And be&s;ides, the point there mentioned is not the point here in debate; &s;o that you have no right to draw any in|ference from that point to this.</P>

<P>Now truly, Sir, if this Paradox of yours

That when he had made one capital, funda|mental, general mi&s;take, he &s;hould happen to make a &s;econd, as capital, as fundamen|tal, as general as the fir&s;t; That he &s;hould not proceed to commit three or four &s;uch
<PB N="66" REF="69">
mi&s;takes, but &s;top at the &s;econd: That the&s;e two mi&s;takes &s;hould chance not to lie both the &s;ame way, but on contrary &s;ides, &s;o that the one might help to correct the other; and la&s;t|ly, that the two contrary errors, among all the infinite proportions which they might bear to one another, &s;hould happen upon that of a perfect equality; &s;o that one might in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es be exactly balanced or com|pen&s;ated by the other. With a quarter of this good fortune a man might get the 10000 <HI>l.</HI> prize in the pre&s;ent Lottery, with a &s;ingle Ticket.</P>
<P>But to come to our point, we are to ex|amine whether the exactne&s;s of the conclu|&s;ion is owing to the exact compen&s;ation of of one of the&s;e errors by the other, or to tho&s;e errors being utterly in&s;ignificant, being in reality no errors at all. And in order thereto I propo&s;e to &s;ee how the conclu&s;ion will come out, when only one of the&s;e er|rors is committed, &s;o that there is nothing to compen&s;ate it.</P>
<P>In your 21 Section, which with its figure I here refer to, the fir&s;t error is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the making the &s;ubtangent or <HI>S</HI> = <GAP DESC="math">, in&s;tead of <HI>S</HI> = <GAP DESC="math">.
<PB N="67" REF="70">
The &s;econd error is making <HI>dy</HI> = <GAP DESC="math">, in&s;tead of <HI>dy</HI> = <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>If both the&s;e errors be committed, or if neither of them be committed, the conclu&s;i|on is agreed to be equally ju&s;t and right, gi|ving <HI>S</HI> =  2<HI>x.</HI></P>
<P>If I avoid the fir&s;t of the&s;e errors, by ma|king <HI>S</HI> = <GAP DESC="math">; and retain the &s;econd, by &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>dy</HI> = <GAP DESC="math">; my conclu&s;ion will be <HI>S</HI> = 2<HI>x</HI> &times; <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>On the other hand if I commit the fir&s;t error, and avoid the &s;econd, my conclu&s;ion will give me <HI>S</HI> = 2<HI>x</HI> &times; <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>Now I affirm that the&s;e two &s;everal va|lues of <HI>S,</HI> which are the re&s;ult of one error only without any thing to compen&s;ate it, are both true and equally exact with the former value, 2<HI>x,</HI> which is the re&s;ult either of two errors, or of none at all. You, I am &s;en&s;ible, will di&s;pute this with me; you will &s;ay that one of the&s;e, 2<HI>x</HI> &times; <GAP DESC="math">, is le&s;s than 2<HI>x</HI>;
<PB N="68" REF="71">
and the latter, 2<HI>x</HI> &times; <GAP DESC="math">, is in the &s;ame proportion bigger than 2<HI>x.</HI> I beg leave therefore, for the information of &s;ome of my readers, to ask you a que&s;tion. Suppo&s;ing the true &s;ubtangent 2<HI>x</HI> to be a thou&s;and miles in length, how much will the &s;econd value of that &s;ubtangent, 2<HI>x</HI> &times; <GAP DESC="math"> fall &s;hort of a thou&s;and miles? Will it be a yard, or a foot, or an inch? None of the&s;e you con|fe&s;s, nor the thou&s;andth, nor the thou&s;and|millionth part of an inch.</P>
<P>I a&s;k farther, what then is this differ|ence? Is it po&s;&s;ible in all the infinity of frac|tional numbers to find any thing &s;mall enough to repre&s;ent it? You own, you con|fe&s;s it is not: You mu&s;t confe&s;s likewi&s;e, that if the&s;e three &s;everal values of S were all to be expre&s;&s;ed in numbers, without be|ing reducible to which, in your <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t Query</HI> 24.</NOTE> opinion, they can be of no u&s;e, they mu&s;t every one be expre&s;&s;ed by 1000, without the lea&s;t tit|tle of variation, addition, or diminution.

<PB N="69" REF="72">
all the difficulties in Divinity are but as motes and atoms!</P>
<P>Since therefore the&s;e errors are wholly in&s;ignificant, my conclu&s;ion when reduced to numbers, coming out exactly the &s;ame, whether the fir&s;t, or &s;econd, or neither, or both of the&s;e errors be committed; and &s;ince by committing both the&s;e errors, the calcu|lus, which would otherwi&s;e, e&s;pecially in the higher operations, be exceedingly tedious and laborious, is now rendered &s;urpri&s;ingly expe|ditious and ea&s;y; it &s;eems to me that this is &s;o far from being any defect in the me|thod of Fluxions, that on the contrary it is one of the greate&s;t advantages and excel|lencies of that invention.

You, Sir, are for avoiding the&s;e two errors; I am for retain|ing them. When you avoid them, do not you <HI>&s;ee your way di&s;tinctly?</HI> And if I retain them, voluntarily, and with my eyes open;

<ITEM>2. You repre&s;ent the two following pro|po&s;itions of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> as contradictory one to the other.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>It,</HI> The general Idea of a Triangle, <HI>is an Idea, wherein &s;ome parts of &s;everal different and incon&s;i&s;tent Ideas are put together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ideas of mixed modes, wherein any incon&s;i&s;t|ent Ideas are put together, cannot &s;o much as exi&s;t in the Mind.</HI></P>
<P>I propo&s;e to clear up the&s;e two points, and to &s;hew that in neither of them Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> is guilty of contradicting him&s;elf: but fir&s;t, in order thereto, I mu&s;t take up a lit|tle of your time in con&s;idering the notion of general, or ab&s;tract Ideas. Which pains I am the rather inclined to take becau&s;e, though I have carefully peru&s;ed what you
<PB N="74" REF="77">
have written upon this &s;ubject, I am one of tho&s;e who &s;till adhere to the vulgar, or ra|ther univer&s;al error of all Mankind, that neither Geometry, nor any other general &s;ci|ence can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without general Ideas.</P>
<P>Though the words ab&s;tract or general Ideas are indifferently u&s;ed by Writers as having the &s;ame common &s;ignification; yet as it may be a means of rendering what I have to &s;ay upon this &s;ubject &s;omething more intelligible, I &s;hall beg leave to make a di&s;tinction between them, not as being dif|ferent in them&s;elves, but only in re&s;pect of the manner in which they are commonly formed or introduced into the mind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall confine the name of ab&s;tract Idea to that, which the mind forms to it&s;elf from the con&s;ideration of &s;ome number of diffe|rent &s;pecies, by ab&s;tracting from tho&s;e par|ticular Ideas in which the &s;pecies differ from one another, and retaining tho&s;e in which they agree.</P>
<P>I &s;hall call that a general Idea, which may be produced in the mind without any con|&s;ideration, or even knowledge, of different Species.</P>
<P>An example will make this very plain. When Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> is forming his Method of
<PB N="75" REF="78">
Plants, he ob&s;erves that Mint, and Sage, and Lavender, and Ro&s;emary, and many o|ther Plants, be&s;ides their particular charac|teri&s;ticks by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another, have &s;ome other marks in which they all agree; as in their leaves growing in pairs oppo&s;ite to each other, a monopetalous labiate flower, with four &s;eeds growing at the bottom of it, and tho&s;e inclo&s;ed in no other ve&s;&s;el than the perian|thium. By joining together the&s;e common marks he forms his compound Idea of that Genus of Plants which he calls verticillate: which from his laying a&s;ide, or ab&s;tracting from all the peculiar di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of the &s;everal &s;pecies, is properly named an ab&s;tract Idea.</P>
<P>But if Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> will teach me Botany by his Method, he mu&s;t take a different cour&s;e; he mu&s;t begin with me where he him&s;elf ended; he mu&s;t fir&s;t introduce into my mind the general Idea of a verticillate plant, and afterwards de&s;cend to particular &s;pecies. He tells me a verticillate plant is one who&s;e leaves grow in pairs oppo&s;ite to each other, and who&s;e flower is monopetalous and la|biate, with four &s;eeds at the bottom of it, and tho&s;e inclo&s;ed only in the perianthium.
<PB N="76" REF="79">
This in me is properly called a general Idea, becau&s;e I &s;hall find it to comprehend all the particular &s;pecies of verticillate plants: but I have no rea&s;on to call it an ab&s;tract Idea, becau&s;e not knowing as yet any of the par|ticular &s;pecies, or their characteri&s;tick differ|ences, I have nothing to ab&s;tract from.</P>
<P>The ab&s;tract Idea therefore is that of the Ma&s;ter or Philo&s;opher; and the general Idea that of the Di&s;ciple. The former requires, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob&s;erves, &s;ome pains and &s;kill to form it: the latter demands neither pains nor &s;kill, it needs only a little attention to conceive it.</P>
<P>In like manner if a per&s;on acquainted with the &s;everal &s;pecies of Triangles, is from the con&s;ideration of the&s;e to form an Idea of a Triangle in general; his method will be to examine the &s;everal compound Ideas of the different &s;pecies of Triangles, and to di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;uch parts of tho&s;e com|pound Ideas as are the peculiar characte|ri&s;ticks of each &s;pecies, and &s;uch parts as are common to all of them in general. Then connecting the&s;e la&s;t together into a new compound Idea, and ab&s;tracting from all the re&s;t, he will have the ab&s;tract Idea of a Triangle; which is that of a &s;pace compre|hended
<PB N="77" REF="80">
by three right lines, add if you plea&s;e, containing three angles.</P>
<P>When he has got this Idea him&s;elf, it is the ea&s;ie&s;t thing in the world, to give it to another. Let him take a Learner, a Boy, &s;uppo&s;e, who has never learned what a tri|angle is, much le&s;s what any particular &s;pecies of Triangle is, and tell him a Tri|angle is a &s;pace comprehended by three right lines: I &s;ay that the Boy, as &s;oon as he un|der&s;tands the meaning of the&s;e words, will have acquired the general Idea of a Tri|angle. If you doubt of it, &s;hew him a rec|tangular Triangle drawn upon paper, and a&s;k him what it is; he will without he&s;ita|tion tell you it is a Triangle: afterwards &s;hew him &s;eparately all the other &s;pecies of Triangles, and you will find he knows them every one to be a Triangle. His Idea of a Triangle therefore is general, ina&s;much as it &s;uits all the particular &s;pecies. And the acquiring this Idea either ab&s;tract, or gene|ral, in Teacher or Scholar, &s;eems to me to be attended with &s;o little difficulty, that I think Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has &s;aid full enough when he declares that the fir&s;t <HI>requires &s;ome pains and skill to form it:</HI> and it is to me &s;ur|pri&s;ing to hear a Gentleman of your pene|tration
<PB N="78" REF="81">
profe&s;s, that <HI>after reiterated endea|vours to apprehend the general Idea of a Tri|angle, you have found it altogether incompre|hen&s;ible.</HI> Put your &s;elf but once in the ca&s;e of a Learner, endeavour to dive&s;t your mind of all your preconceived Geometrical Ideas, and then turn to <HI>Euclid</HI>'s definitions; and I'll venture to a&s;&s;ure you, you will find no more difficulty in apprehending the general Idea of a Triangle, than in apprehending the Idea of an obliqueangled, or of a &s;ca|lene Triangle, or even that of an Angle a|lone; there being no objection again&s;t the fir&s;t, but what may with equal rea&s;on be brought again&s;t any of the others; as will ea&s;ily appear to him that con&s;iders, that an angle in general, an obliqueangled Triangle in general, and a &s;calene Triangle in general can no where exi&s;t but in Idea only, any more than a Triangle in general.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much concerning the ab&s;tract, or general Idea of a Triangle, I come now to examine into your charge again&s;t Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> and in the fir&s;t place I mu&s;t take notice that this charge is intro|duced in an unfair and unju&s;t manner. <HI>If any one were able to introduce that Idea into my mind</HI>; &s;ay you, <HI>it mu&s;t be the Author of</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="82">
<HI>the E&s;&s;ay concerning Human Under&s;tanding</HI>; &amp;c. <HI>Let us therefore &s;ee how this celebrated Author de&s;cribes the general, or ab&s;tract Idea of a Tri|angle.</HI> Would not any body imagine from the&s;e words that Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> were here pur|po&s;ely <HI>de&s;cribing</HI> this Idea, in order to <HI>in|troduce it into the mind</HI> of one who had it not already? If that were his intention, it is certainly a mo&s;t mi&s;erable de&s;cription; &s;ince no per&s;on living who does not already know what a Triangle is, can ever have <HI>that Idea introduced into his mind</HI> from what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> here lays down. And yet that Idea is introduced into the mind with all the ea&s;e in the world by what he gives us to under|&s;tand in another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ay on Hum. Under&s;t. B. II.

Is it not plain to any one who attentively reads the pa&s;&s;age you refer to, that his intention there was not to <HI>de&s;cribe</HI> the general Idea of a Triangle, but only to &s;hew from the &s;eem|ing incon&s;i&s;tencies in that Idea, &s;uppo&s;ed to be already known, that it required &s;ome pains and &s;kill to form it, as well as other
<PB N="80" REF="83">
ab&s;tract Ideas? Ob&s;erve his words, <Q REND="inline">For ab&s;tract Ideas are not &s;o obvious or ea&s;y to children, or the yet unexerci&s;ed mind, as particular ones. If they &s;eem &s;o to grown men, 'tis only becau&s;e by con&s;tant and familiar u&s;e they are made &s;o. For when we nicely reflect upon them, we &s;hall find, that general Ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty with them, and do not &s;o ea&s;ily offer them&s;elves, as we are apt to ima|gine. For example, Does it not require &s;ome pains and &s;kill to form the general Idea of a Triangle? (Which yet is none of the mo&s;t ab&s;tract, comprehen&s;ive and difficult.) For it mu&s;t be neither oblique, nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicru|ral, nor &s;calenon; but all and none of the&s;e at once. In effect, it is &s;omething imperfect, that cannot exi&s;t; an Idea where|in &s;ome parts of &s;everal different and in|con&s;i&s;tent Ideas are put together.</Q></P>
<P>We come now to the manife&s;t, &s;taring contradictions, contained in this Idea of a Triangle: the fir&s;t of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is contained in the&s;e words, <HI>all and none of the&s;e at once.</HI> The <HI>Enantio&s;is,</HI> I confe&s;s, is pretty &s;trong: and yet the meaning of it is plain|ly
<PB N="81" REF="84">
no more than this, that the general Idea of a Triangle is a part of the Idea of eve|ry &s;pecies of Triangles here enumerated, but is not the intire Idea of any one of them; is common to them all, and confi|ned to none. <HI>It is &s;omething imperfect that cannot exi&s;t,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be another of your contradictions. It does not appear &s;o to me. For every individual Triangle, every Trian|gle that can exi&s;t, mu&s;t be &s;omething more than a &s;pace included by three lines, it mu&s;t al&s;o have the characteri&s;tick mark of &s;ome one of the particular &s;pecies of Triangles; without which it would be <HI>imperfect, it could not exi&s;t,</HI> which is what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> here &s;ays of a Triangle in general.</P>
<P N="2">2. But the great contradiction of all &s;eems to lie in the two following propo&s;itions, which are brought together from different parts of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s works, and &s;et to &s;tare one another in the face to di&s;grace their Author.</P>
<P>It is an Idea, wherein &s;ome parts of &s;e|veral different and incon&s;i&s;tent Ideas are put together.</P>

Here, Sir, I &s;trongly apprehend you are fallen into one of tho&s;e traps, which this Great Man would &s;ometimes divert him|&s;elf with &s;etting to catch unwary cavillers, the <HI>Homines &s;tolidos &amp; ad depugnandum paratos,</HI> that I mentioned a while ago.

And as it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that the&s;e four fir&s;t parts are the &s;ame in all the other particular Species of Triangles; and that the &s;ame four parts do compo&s;e the general Idea of a Triangle; it is plain that the general Idea of a Triangle is an Idea, wherein SOME PARTS OF &s;everal different and incon&s;i&s;tent Ideas are put together.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t therefore of the two propo&s;itions

in que&s;tion is undoubtedly true; and as the&s;e parts are no way incon&s;i&s;tent with one ano|ther, it is manife&s;t that the &s;econd propo&s;ition is not contradictory, or at all repugnant to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I come now, Sir, to take my leave of you, and hope that if an hone&s;t zeal for truth in the fir&s;t place, and in the &s;econd for the reputation of tho&s;e Gentlemen to whom I conceive the whole body of mankind, at lea&s;t I mu&s;t ac|knowledge my &s;elf to be highly indebted, has given occa&s;ion not only of differing from you, but even of reprehending you with the utmo&s;t freedom wherever I thought the truth and your behaviour required it; you will not impute the liberty I have taken to any di&s;|re&s;pect for your per&s;on, which I am an utter &s;tranger to, though I have a very great e&s;teem and value for your uncommon abilities and many of your writings, and am with &s;incere re&s;pect,</P>
