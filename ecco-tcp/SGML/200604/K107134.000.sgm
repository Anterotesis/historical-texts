<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Poem which was writ with a De&s;ign to &s;hew the Prevalence and Power of Union, could to no Per&s;on be more pro|perly Addre&s;t than Your Lord&s;hip, who have ever &s;ince You have appear'd in the World been &s;o great a pro|moter of Union.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
In tho&s;e great Offices of the highe&s;t Tru&s;t; in which Your Lord&s;hip has been employ'd at the &s;ame Time, both by the Prince and the People, You have always made pro|fe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Publick and Noble Principles which alone are capable of Uniting the Prince and the People.</P>
<P>And while in the late Reign the Commons of <HI>Eng|land</HI> hearken'd to Your Lord|&s;hip's Advice in Parliament, they were united in their In|clinations and their De&s;igns to the great People whom they repre&s;ented. The Nerves of War were duely &s;upply'd, and that War was carried on
<PB REF="4">
Vigorou&s;ly. The Greatne&s;s of <HI>France</HI> was &s;app'd by de|grees and in&s;en&s;ibly Under|min'd, and prepar'd to re|ceive a terrible Shock from the fir&s;t Blow it &s;hould meet with. But as &s;oon as Your Lord&s;hip's Enemies began to prevail in tho&s;e Illu&s;trious A&s;&s;emblies, a Spirit of Parci|mony ill Under&s;tood and wor&s;e Tim'd crept in among&s;t them, and forc'd the be&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;cerning of Kings to make a fatal Peace, which has endanger'd the Liberties of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Power and Traffick of this <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and has co&s;t this Nation &s;o many Thou&s;ands of Lives and &s;o
<PB REF="5">
many Millions of Money, and which makes us ev'n at pre|&s;ent contented, in order to the ending this ju&s;t and ne|ce&s;&s;ary War, to furni&s;h tho&s;e Supplies in the very mid&s;t of Scarcity, which we then grumbling with-held in the Height of the greate&s;t Af|fluence.</P>
<P>My Lord, The late King who was &s;o True and &s;o Ju&s;t a Judge of Men, was &s;o very well convinc'd of Your Lord|&s;hip's Services both to the Crown and the People, that He took care by two ju&s;t and two grateful Acts, that is, by calling You up to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and making You
<PB REF="6">
Auditor of the Exchequer, that Your Country &s;hould never want Your Service in Parliament, nor the Crown Your Abilities in the great Employments of the State.</P>
<P>The extraordinary Regard which &s;o great a King always expre&s;s'd for Your Lord&s;hip's extraordinary Merit, pro|vok'd Your Enemies to en|deavour to fix on You the odious Name of Favourite, as they have &s;ince attempted to fa&s;ten it on &s;ome of Your Il|lu&s;trious Friends. But with how much Malice, or how much Ignorance have both Attempts been made! For a Favourite is the Prince's meer
<PB REF="7">
Creature, who&s;e only Merit is His Sovereign's Favour, and &s;uch an Object of the Prince's Favour is always that of the Peoples Scorn and Hatred, and often expo&s;es the very Sovereign to the &s;ame Contempt and Hatred. Sovereign Princes are ob|lig'd by their Duty to God, them&s;elves and their People, to &s;hew mo&s;t Regard for tho&s;e who do mo&s;t for the good of the People whom They govern. And when they perform that Duty, ev'n Kings are Ju&s;tly Honour'd the more for the Merits of their Subjects. How Happy is the Nation where the Mini&s;ters
<PB REF="8">
of Kings become the Darlings of the People. How Happy was <HI>England</HI> during the Time of Your Admini|&s;tration! When Your Lord|&s;hip was united both to the King and the People; when the People declar'd aloud by their Repre&s;entatives in Par|liament, that You had de|&s;erv'd the Honours by which the King di&s;tingui&s;h'd You! How Happy are we now, when the Queen Employs the mo&s;t extraordinary Per|&s;ons in the Highe&s;t Employ|ments, who&s;e Prai&s;es are ce|lebrated by the Augu&s;t A&s;|&s;emblies of Parliament, and ecchoed by every part of the
<PB REF="9">
Kingdom. Since never Prin|ces were more univer&s;ally e|&s;teem'd by the People of <HI>Eng|land</HI> than the late King and the pre&s;ent Queen, 'tis an In|fallible &s;ign that the &s;ame People approve of their cho|&s;en Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip, who in the late Reign was con&s;tantly employ'd in uniting the King and the People, or the Peo|ple and their Repre&s;enta|tives, has been ju&s;tly thought in this to be the fitte&s;t Per&s;on to maintain Union between the two Sovereign Princes in whom <HI>England</HI> is mo&s;t con|cern'd. With how &s;en&s;ible a plea&s;ure do all who have the
<PB REF="10">
Honour to know Your Lord|&s;hip, con&s;ider the People of <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;urveying You with a venerable Awe, as a Per&s;on employ'd in Affairs of the Highe&s;t Tru&s;t and the Highe&s;t Con&s;equence by the Two greate&s;t Princes that e|ver ruled the brave&s;t People of <HI>Europe.</HI> The late King made choice of Your Lord|&s;hip to &s;tand in the Breach which Faction had made in the Ramparts of Liberty. The Queen has cho&s;en You not only to re&s;i&s;t but to at|tack Faction, and to drive it from its la&s;t Retrenchment, by &s;ettling and &s;ecuring an intire Corre&s;pondence between
<PB REF="11">
Her Maje&s;ty and Her pre&s;umptive Heir. And the Queen could not po&s;&s;ibly re|po&s;e a greater Tru&s;t in Your Lord&s;hip than by employing You in an Affair, the Succe&s;s of which, was of &s;o dear con|cern to Her Maje&s;ty as the &s;ecuring both the Court of <HI>Hanover</HI> and Her own Sub|jects, of Her hearty Intenti|ons in Relation to the Act of Settlement. When that Court beheld in Your Lord&s;hip &s;o glorious an Example of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Greatne&s;s, how were they exalted to think what a People they were one Day to Govern, tho' may that be late. They began to think
<PB REF="12">
&s;ome of their future Subjects equal to Foreign Princes, and Your Lord&s;hip was en|tertain'd with the &s;ame Ho|nours which are paid to them.</P>
<P>The great Things which Your Lord&s;hip has done for uniting the Prince and the Succe&s;&s;our, the Prince and the People, and the People among one another, and for re&s;i&s;ting the Force and Arti|fices of the Common Enemy, ought in gratitude to unite the Inclinations of all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men to Your Lord&s;hip. To whom we have all &s;o great Obligations, that we cannot &s;o much as pay or receive the very lea&s;t Summ without reflecting
<PB REF="13">
on our Engagements to the late King, and to You; to the late King, who&s;e I|mage we &s;ee upon every &s;ingle Piece, and to Your Lord&s;hip who plac'd it there; when in the mid&s;t of the publick Indigence (an Indi|gence like that of <HI>Tantalus</HI> that plagued us in the mid&s;t of Plenty, when the Mi&s;er rol|ling in full Bags might then fir&s;t be truly &s;aid to be lite|rally poor) Your Lord&s;hip by a political and noble Alchy|my tran&s;muted Pewter and &s;ordid Bra&s;s to Silver and fine Gold, and by an Action &s;o great and &s;o beneficent, &s;e+cur'd real Property to tho&s;e
<PB REF="14">
at Home, who had but the Shadow of it before, and re|viv'd and re&s;tor'd the expi|ring Credit of the Nation a|broad. Since My Lord Trea|&s;urer by his admirable Ma|nagement of the Nerves of War, is &s;o ju&s;tly &s;aid to have had &s;o great a &s;hare in the glorious Succe&s;&s;es of the late Campaigns, Your Lord&s;hip &s;ure mu&s;t have no &s;mall one, &s;ince without what you have done, there could be no Ma|nagement.</P>
<P>The&s;e, My Lord, are the publick Rea&s;ons for Addre&s;|&s;ing the following Poem to Your Lord&s;hip. There is a private one, and that is, that
<PB REF="15">
when a Man contracts &s;o great a Debt as to make him In&s;olvent, the lea&s;t thing that he can do is to acknowledge what he can never pay; thus Bankrupts, when they can make no other return, &s;end their Creditors an Epi&s;tle. I have lately had very great Obligations to Your Lord|&s;hip: You have been pleas'd to take &s;ome care of my For|tune at a Time when I mo&s;t wanted it, and had lea&s;t rea|&s;on to expect it from You, &s;ince &s;everal things hinder'd my giving that con&s;tant at|tendance on You, which Per|&s;ons of Quality &s;o &s;crupu|lou&s;ly exact from tho&s;e of
<PB REF="16">
Inferiour Rank, and with which, when Your Lord&s;hip is generou&s;ly pleas'd to Di&s;|pen&s;e, You plainly Declare, that Your Noble Notions of Liberty are not embrac'd by You as they are by many, either out of Pride, or on the account of Intere&s;t, but by a Principle of Exalted Rea&s;on, and Goodne&s;s, and Humanity. This is the fir&s;t Opportunity which I have had &s;ince I receiv'd Your Favours of paying my Ac|knowledgments to You in &s;o publick a manner, which I de&s;ire Your Lord&s;hip to accept with Your u&s;ual Goodne&s;s. But how fal&s;e or
<PB REF="17">
how bounded is Human Virtue! And how few are Grateful without a De&s;ign of engaging their Benefa|ctors or others to Heap more Benefits on them, by &s;hew|ing that they can be &s;en&s;ible of them. This very Addre&s;s to Your Lord&s;hip is not without an Intention of en|gaging You who&s;e Judgment in the&s;e Matters is acknow|ledg'd by all the World, to defend, as far as Your Con|&s;cience will give You leave, one of the Bolde&s;t Poems that has been writ for &s;eve|ral Years. But I who konw the va&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s in which You are engag'd, am pre&s;uming

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THough the attempt which I have made in the following Poem is very bold, yet I would not have the Reader believe it Ra&s;h. I think my &s;elf obliged, then to &s;atisfie him without any Delay, that it is by no means de|&s;igned to be a ju&s;t Epick Poem. I know too little of the Nature of that Poem, and too much of my own infirmity ever to at|tempt to write one. But tho' this can by no means pa&s;s for a ju&s;t Epick Poem, yet is it &s;omething of the Epick Kind, and bears the &s;ame proportion to a ju&s;t Poem that a &s;hort and a faint E&s;&s;ay do's to a full and a perfect Treati&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="20">
That which threw me into this way of writing was the very Subject of the Poem. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> has laid &s;uch High Obligations upon his Country, that nothing can be &s;aid too much of him, nor done too much for him. And this obli|ged me to endeavour to do &s;omething more Bold and more Great, than any thing that I had endeavoured to do former|ly.</P>
<P>But no Poem that is not Religious can be great without extravagance or bold without ra&s;hne&s;s, which has been for|merly prov'd. But there were but two ways of writing a Religious Poem upon this Occa&s;ion. The one was to do it by way of Hymn, and the other was to in|troduce Machines. The former being anticipated in the Poem which I wrote on the Battle of <HI>Bleinem</HI>; there remai|ned only the latter.</P>
<P><PB REF="21">
But here I ea&s;ily fore&s;ee that the fol|lowing Objection will be made, and that is, that &s;ince what the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> has done is in its &s;elf &s;o great and &s;o wonderful, what occa&s;ion was there to endeavour to adorn it by Fiction. To which I an&s;wer, that becau&s;e what the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> has done is in its &s;elf &s;o wonderful that it appears in|credible, and Truth it &s;elf has the Re|&s;emblance of Fable and of Fiction, for that very Rea&s;on I was encouraged to embelli&s;h it with the Ornaments of Poe|try. This is the Defence that <HI>Boileau</HI> has made for him&s;elf in his fourth Epi|&s;tle, for introducing Machines into his De&s;cription of the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> And if the Apology &s;tands good for him, as it has always pa&s;t hitherto, it is &s;till better for me. For my Machines are Chri&s;tian whereas his are Pagan, and con&s;equently can rai&s;e no great Emotion in the Minds of the Readers, becau&s;e
<PB REF="22">
they are incredible, according to one of his own Ver&s;es.</P>
<Q><L>L' e&s;prit n'e&s;t point emu de ce qu'il ne croit pas.</L></Q>
<P>If any one objects that what I make my Machines &s;ay and act will no more be believed than what <HI>Boileau</HI> Attributes to the God of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to that I an|&s;wer, that though things did not actu|ally pa&s;s before and in the Battle of <HI>Ra|millies,</HI> as they are related here, yet he who believes the Chri&s;tian Religion and a particular Providence, and Reflects upon a hundred Pa&s;&s;ages in the Old and new Te&s;tament, mu&s;t allow, that there pa&s;t &s;omething not altogether unlike it. We &s;ee it is the Opinion of the Duke him&s;elf, that the Hand of God was in it, that Heaven, which leaves mo&s;t Events to common Cau&s;es, was immediately con|cerned in this. Now can any thing be more rea&s;onable for one who believes that
<PB REF="23">
Heaven was immediately concerned on one &s;ide, than to believe that Hell, which our Religion tells us is always for oppo|&s;ing the great De&s;igns of Heaven, was immediately concerned on the other. Thus the De&s;ign of this Poem is built and the Machines are introduced upon what happened to the Duke in the Bat|tle, and what he him&s;elf wrote to one of our Mini&s;ters of State after it.</P>
<P>Thus I have given an Account of the De&s;ign of this Poem; How well that de|&s;ign is executed, I mu&s;t leave to the Rea|der. As I have con&s;ulted my Friends who are fam'd for their Judgment in things of this Nature, as to what relates to the fir&s;t four Books, and have had them by me long enough to form &s;ome Judgment of them my &s;elf, I know the Fort and the Foible of them. For the fifth I have neither had it by me long enough to make any Judgment of it my &s;elf, nor have I had time enough to con&s;ult my
<PB REF="24">
Friends about it. And therefore if there is any thing ami&s;s in it, I mu&s;t leave it to the indulgence of the Candid Reader. I only de&s;ire him to take notice, that having formerly de&s;crib'd with all the Application of which I was capable, a Battle gain'd by the &s;ame General, I was obliged to take a very different method in this Poem. I have only this to add, that I have not &s;aid &s;o much as I thought to have done, of the Important Con&s;equnces of the Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> becau&s;e I have &s;ome thoughts of writing a Pindarick Poem upon that great Action of <HI>Quintus Flaminius,</HI> which re&s;tored Liberty to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Citties. Between which Illu|&s;trious <HI>Roman</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough,</HI> a very ju&s;t Parallel may be drawn.</P>

<L>Mean while the Snaky Horrours of her Head</L>

<L>Red Lightning Dart, and Thunder was her Voice.</L>
<L>As &s;ternly &s;he the Field of Death &s;urveys,</L>
