<HEAD>A PROPOSAL for the better &s;upplying of Churches in our foreign Plantations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_ALTHOUGH there are &s;everal excellent per&s;ons of the church of England, who&s;e good intentions and endeavours have not been want|ing to propagate the go&s;pel in foreign parts, who have even combined into a &s;ociety for that very purpo&s;e, and given great encourage|ment, not only for Engli&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries in the We&s;t-Indies, but al&s;o, for the reformed of o|ther nations, led by their example to propa|gate chri&s;tianity in the Ea&s;t: It is neverthe|le&s;s acknowledged, that there is at this day, but little &s;en&s;e of religion, and a mo&s;t notorious corruption of manners, in the Engli&s;h colonies &s;ettled on the continent of America, and the i&s;lands. It is al&s;o acknowledged that the go|&s;pel hath hitherto made but a very incon&s;idera|ble
<PB N="4" REF="3">
progre&s;s among the neighbouring Ameri|cans, who &s;till continue in much-what the &s;ame ignorance and barbari&s;m, in which we found them above a hundred years ago.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore venture to &s;ubmit my thoughts upon a point, that I have long con&s;i|dered, to better judgments, in hopes that any expedient will be favourably hearkned to, which is propo&s;ed for the remedy of the&s;e evils. Now in order to effect this, it &s;hould &s;eem the natural proper method, to provide, in the fir&s;t place, a con&s;tant &s;upply of worthy clergy-men for the Engli&s;h churches in tho&s;e parts; and in the &s;e|cond place, a like con&s;tant &s;upply of zealous mi&s;&s;ionaries well fitted for propagating chri&s;ti|anity among the &s;avages.</P>
<P>For tho' the &s;ure&s;t means to reform the mo|rals, and &s;often the behaviour of men, be, to preach to them the pure uncorrupt doctrine of the go&s;pel, yet it cannot be denied that the &s;ucce&s;s of preaching dependeth in good mea|&s;ure on the character and skill of the preach|er: Fora&s;much as mankind are more apt to copy characters than to practi&s;e precepts, and fora&s;much as argument, to attain it's full &s;trength, doth not le&s;s require the life of zeal, than the weight of rea&s;on; and the &s;ame doc|trine, which maketh great impre&s;&s;ion, when delivered with decency and addre&s;s, lo&s;eth ve|ry much of its force by pa&s;&s;ing thro' aukward or unskilful hands.</P>
<P>Now the clergy &s;ent over to America have proved, too many of them, very meanly qua|lified both in learning and morals for the di&s;|charge of their office. And indeed little can be expected from the example or in&s;truction of
<PB N="5" REF="4">
tho&s;e, who quit their native country on no o|ther motive, than that they are not able to pro|cure a livelihood in it, which is known to be often the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And tho' it be allowed that &s;ome of the&s;e have approved them&s;elves men of merit, it will at the &s;ame time be allowed, that the mo&s;t zealous and able mi&s;&s;ionary from England mu&s;t find him&s;elf but ill qualified for converting the heathen, if we con&s;ider the difference of language, their wild way of living, and above all, the great jealou&s;y and prejudice which &s;avage nations have towards foreigners, or in|novations introduced by them.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations make it evident, that a college or &s;eminary in tho&s;e parts is very much wanted; and therefore the providing &s;uch a &s;eminary, is earne&s;tly propo&s;ed and re|commended to all tho&s;e, who have it in their power, to contribute to &s;o good a work. By this, two ends would be obtained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the youth of our Engli&s;h plantations might be them&s;elves fitted for the mini&s;try; and men of merit would be then glad to fill the churches of their native country, which are now a drain for the very dregs and refu&s;e of ours.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, there are, I am told, many churches vacant in our plantations, and many very ill &s;upplied; nor can all the vigilance and wi&s;dom of that great prelate, who&s;e peculiar care it is, prevent this, &s;o long as the afore|&s;aid churches are &s;upplied from England.</P>
<P>And, &s;upplied they mu&s;t be, with &s;uch as can be picked up in England or Ireland, till a nur&s;ery of learning for the education of the na|tives
<PB N="6" REF="5">
is founded. This indeed might provide a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of learned and exempla|ry pa&s;tors; and what effect this mu&s;t be &s;uppo|&s;ed to have on their flocks, I need not &s;ay.</P>
<P>Secondly, the children of &s;avage Ameri|cans, brought up in &s;uch a &s;eminary, and well in&s;tructed in religion and learning, might make the able&s;t and propere&s;t mi&s;&s;ionaries for &s;preading the go&s;pel among their countrymen; who would be le&s;s apt to &s;u&s;pect, and readier to embrace a doctrine recommended by neigh|bours or relations, men of their own blood and language, than if it were propo&s;ed by fo|reigners, who would not improbably be thought to have de&s;igns on the liberty or pro|perty of their converts.</P>
<P>The young Americans nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, may, in the beginning be procured, either by peaceable methods from tho&s;e &s;avage nations, which border on our colonies, and are in friend&s;hip with us, or by taking captive the children of our enemies.</P>
<P>It is propo&s;ed to admit into the afore&s;aid college only &s;uch &s;avages as are under ten years of age, before evil habits have taken a deep root; and yet not &s;o early as to prevent retaining their mother tongue, which &s;hould be pre&s;erved by intercour&s;e among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is further propo&s;ed, to ground the&s;e young Americans thoroughly in religion and morality, and to give them a good tincture of other learning; particularly of eloquence, hi&s;tory, and practical mathematicks: to which it may not be improper to add &s;ome skill in phy&s;ick.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
If there were a yearly &s;upply of ten or a dozen &s;uch mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent abroad into their re&s;pective countries, after they had received the degree of ma&s;ter of arts in the afore&s;aid college, and holy orders in England, (till &s;uch time as epi&s;copacy be e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e parts) it is hardly to be doubted, but, in a little time the world would &s;ee good and great effects thereof.</P>
<P>For, to any con&s;idering man, the employing American mi&s;&s;ionaries for the conver&s;ion of America, will, of all others, appear the mo&s;t likely method to &s;ucceed; e&s;pecially if care be taken, that, during the whole cour&s;e of their education, an eye &s;hould be had to their mi&s;&s;ion; that they &s;hould be taught betimes to con&s;ider them&s;elves as train'd up in that &s;ole view, without any other pro&s;pect of provi&s;ion, or employment; that a zeal for religion, and love of their country, &s;hould be early and con&s;tantly in&s;tilled into their minds, by repeat|ed lectures and admonitions; that they &s;hould not only be incited by the common topics of religion and nature, but farther animated and enflamed by the great examples, in pa&s;t ages, of publick &s;pirit and virtue, to re&s;cue their countrymen from their &s;avage manners, to a life of civility and religion.</P>
<P>If his maje&s;ty would graciou&s;ly plea&s;e to grant a charter for a college to be erected in a proper place for the&s;e u&s;es, it is to be hoped a fund may be &s;oon rai&s;ed, by the con|tribution of well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, &s;ufficient for building and endowing the &s;ame. For as the nece&s;&s;ary expence would be &s;mall, &s;o there are men of religion and humanity in England,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
who would be plea&s;ed to &s;ee any de&s;ign &s;et forward for the glory of God and the good of mankind.</P>
<P>A &s;mall expence would &s;uffice to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and educate the American mi&s;&s;ionaries in a plain &s;imple manner, &s;uch as might make it ea&s;y for them to return to the coar&s;e and poor me|thods of life in u&s;e among their countrymen; and nothing can contribute more to le&s;&s;en this expence, than a judicious choice of the &s;ituation, where the &s;eminary is to &s;tand.</P>
<P>Many things ought to be con&s;idered in the choice of a &s;ituation. It &s;hould be in a good air; in a place where provi&s;ions are cheap and plenty; where an intercour&s;e might ea&s;ily be kept up with all parts of America and the i&s;lands; in a place of &s;ecurity not expo&s;ed to the in&s;uits of pyrates, &s;avages, or other enemies; where there is no great trade, which might tempt the readers or fellows of the college to become merchants, to the neglect of their proper bu&s;ine&s;s; where there are neither rich|es nor luxury to divert, or le&s;&s;en their applica|tion, or to make them unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfied with a homely frugal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: la&s;tly, where the inhabitants, if &s;uch a place may be found, are noted for innocence and &s;impli|city of manners. I need not &s;ay of how great importance this point would be toward forming the morals of young &s;tudents, and what mighty influence it mu&s;t have on the mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is evident the college long &s;ince pro|jected in Barbadoes would be defective in ma|ny of the&s;e particulars; for tho' it may have its u&s;e among the inhabitants, yet a place of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;o high trade, &s;o much wealth and luxury, and &s;uch di&s;&s;olute morals, not to mention the great price and &s;carcity of provi&s;ions; mu&s;t at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eem a very improper &s;ituation for a general &s;eminary intended for the forming mi&s;&s;ionaries, and educating youth in religion and &s;obriety of manners. The &s;ame objec|tions lie again&s;t the neighbouring i&s;lands.</P>
<P>And if we con&s;ider the accounts given of their avarice and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, their coldne&s;s in the practice of religion, and their aver&s;ion from propagating it, (which appears in the withholding their &s;laves from bapti&s;m) it is to be feared, that the inhabitants in the populous parts of our plantations on the continent are not much fitter, than tho&s;e in the i&s;lands a|bovementioned, to influence or a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch a de|&s;ign. And as to the more remote and le&s;s fre|quented parts, the difficulty of being &s;uppli|ed with nece&s;&s;aries, the danger of being expo|&s;ed to the inroads of &s;avages; and above all, the want of intercour&s;e with other places, ren|der them improper &s;ituations for a &s;eminary of religion and learning.</P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert here an ob&s;er|vation, I remember to have &s;een in an ab&s;tract of the proceedings, &amp;c. annexed to the Dean of Canterbury's &s;ermon, before the &s;ociety for the propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts; that the &s;avage Indians, who live on the continent, will not &s;uffer their children to learn Engli&s;h or Dutch, le&s;t they &s;hould be debauched by conver&s;ing with their European neighbours; which is a melancholy, but &s;trong confirmation of the truth of what hath been now advanced.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
A general intercour&s;e and corre&s;pondence with all the Engli&s;h colonies, both on the i&s;lands and the continent, and with other parts of America, hath been before laid down, as a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance, the rea&s;on whereof is very evident. But this circum&s;tance is hard|ly to be found. For on the continent, where there are neither inns, nor carriages, nor bridges over the rivers, there is no travelling by land between di&s;tant places. And the Eng|li&s;h &s;ettlements are reputed to extend along the &s;ea-coa&s;t for the &s;pace of fifteen hundred miles. It is therefore plain, there can be no convenient communication between them, o|therwi&s;e than by &s;ea; no advantage therefore, in this point, can be gained by &s;ettling on the continent.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;ideration, which e|qually regards the continent and i&s;lands, that the general cour&s;e of trade and corre&s;pon|dence lies from all tho&s;e colonies to Great Bri|tain alone: Whereas, for our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to pitch upon a place, if &s;uch could be found, which main|tains a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with all the other colonies, and who&s;e commerce lies chiefly or altogether (not in Europe, but) in America.</P>
<P>There is but one &s;pot that I can find, to which, this circum&s;tance agrees: And that is the i&s;les of Bermuda, otherwi&s;e called the Summer I&s;lands. The&s;e having no rich com|modity or manufacture, &s;uch as &s;ugar, tobac|co, or the like, wherewithal to trade to Eng|land, are obliged to become carriers for Ame|rica, as the Dutch are for Europe. The Ber|mudans are excellent &s;hipwrights and &s;ailors,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and have a great number of very good &s;loops, which are always pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing from all parts of America. They drive a con&s;tant trade to the i&s;lands of Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antego, &amp;c, with butter, onions, cabbages, and other roots and vegetables, which they have in great plenty and perfection. They have al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall manufactures of joyner's work and matting, which they export to the plantations on the continent. Hence Bermu|dan &s;loops are oftner &s;een in the ports of A|merica, than any other. And indeed, by the be&s;t information I could get, it appears they are the only people of all the Briti&s;h planta|tions, who hold a general corre&s;pondence with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And, as the commerce of Bermuda renders it a very fit place, wherein to erect a &s;emina|ry, &s;o likewi&s;e doth its &s;ituation, it being pla|ced between our plantations on the continent, and tho&s;e in the i&s;les, &s;o as equally to re&s;pect both. To which may be added, that it lies in the way of ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ing from America to Great Britain; all which makes it plain, that the youth, to be educated in a &s;eminary pla|ced in the Summer I&s;lands, would have fre|quent opportunities of going thither and cor|re&s;ponding with their Friends. It mu&s;t in|deed be owned, that &s;ome will be obliged to go a long way to any one place, which we &s;up|po&s;e re&s;orted to, from all parts of our plan|tations; but if we were to look out a &s;pot the neare&s;t approaching to an equal di&s;tance from all the re&s;t, I believe it would be found to be Bermuda. It remains, that we &s;ee whether it
<PB N="12" REF="11">
enjoys the other qualities or conditions laid down as well as this.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer i&s;lands are &s;ituated near the latitude of thirty three degrees; no part of the world enjoys a purer air, or a more tem|perate climate, the great ocean which envi|rons them, at once moderating the heat of the &s;outh winds and the &s;everity of the north we&s;t. Such a latitude on the continent might be thought too hot; but the air in Bermuda is perpetually fanned and kept cool by &s;ea-breezes, which renders the weather the mo&s;t healthy and delightful that could be wi&s;hed, being, (as is affirmed by per&s;ons, who have long lived there) of one equal tenour almo&s;t throughout the whole year, like the latter end of a fine May; in&s;omuch that it is re&s;orted to as the Montpelier of America.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e i&s;les le&s;s remarkable for plen|ty than for health; there being, be&s;ides beef, mutton, and fowl, great abundance of fruits, and garden-&s;tuff of all kinds in perfection: To this, if we add the prodigious plenty and variety of excellent fi&s;h, which is every day taken on their coa&s;ts, it would &s;eem, that a &s;e|minary could no where be &s;upplied with bet|ter provi&s;ions, or cheaper than here.</P>
<P>About forty years ago, upon cutting down many tall cedars, that &s;heltered their orange-trees from the north-we&s;t-wind (which &s;ome|times blows, even there, &s;o as to affect that delicate plant) great part of their orange plantations &s;uffered; but other cedars are &s;ince grown up, and no doubt a little indu&s;try would again produce as great plenty of oran|ges, as ever was there heretofore. I mention
<PB N="13" REF="12">
this, becau&s;e &s;ome have inferred from the pre|&s;ent &s;carcity of that fruit, for which Bermuda was once &s;o famous, that there hath been a change in the &s;oil and climate for the wor&s;e. But this, as hath been ob&s;erved, proceeded from another cau&s;e, which is now in great mea&s;ure taken away.</P>
<P>Bermuda is a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands, which lie in a very narrow compa&s;s, containing, in all, not quite twenty thou&s;and acres. This groupe of i&s;les is (to u&s;e Mr. Waller's expre&s;|&s;ion) walled round with rocks, which render them inacce&s;&s;ible to pyrates, or enemies; there being but two narrow entrances, both well guarded by forts. It would therefore be im|po&s;&s;ible to find any where, a more &s;ecure re|treat for &s;tudents.</P>
<P>The trade of Bermuda con&s;i&s;ts only in gar|den-&s;tuff, and &s;ome poor manufactures, prin|cipally of cedar and the palmetto leaf. Ber|muda hats are worn by our ladies: They are made of a &s;ort of mat, or (as they call it) platting made of the palmetto leaf, which is the only commodity that I can find exported from Bermuda to Great Britain; and as there is no pro&s;pect of making a fortune by this &s;mall trade, &s;o it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to tempt the fellows of the college to engage in it, to the neglect of their peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s, which might po&s;&s;ibly be the ca&s;e el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Such as their trade is, &s;uch is their wealth; the inhabitants being much poorer than the other colonies, who do not fail to de&s;pi&s;e them upon that account. But if they have le&s;s wealth, they have withal le&s;s vice and expen|&s;ive folly than their neighbours. They are
<PB N="14" REF="13">
repre&s;ented as a contented, plain, innocent &s;ort of people, free from avarice and luxury, as well as the other corruptions that attend tho&s;e vices.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o informed, that they are more con|&s;tant attendants on divine &s;ervice, more kind and re&s;pectful to their pa&s;tor, (when they have one) and &s;hew much more humanity to their &s;laves and charity to one another, than is ob&s;erved among the Engli&s;h in the other plan|tations: one rea&s;on of this may be, that con|demned criminals, being employed in the manu|factures of &s;ugar and tobacco, were never tran&s;ported thither. But, whatever be the cau&s;e, the facts are atte&s;ted by a Clergyman of good credit, who lived long among them.</P>
<P>Among a people of this character, and in a &s;ituation thus circum&s;tantiated, it would &s;eem that a religious &s;eminary might very fitly be placed. The corre&s;pondence with other parts of America, the goodne&s;s of the air, the plenty and &s;ecurity of the place, the frugality and innocence of the inhabitants, all con&s;piring to favour &s;uch a de&s;ign. Thus much at lea&s;t is evident, that young &s;tudents would be there le&s;s liable to be corrupted in their morals; and the governing part would be ea&s;ier, and better contented with a &s;mall &s;tipend and a re|tired academical life, in a corner from whence avarice and luxury are excluded, than they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the mid&s;t of a full trade and great riches, attended with all that high living and parade which our planters af|fect, and which, as well as all fa&s;hionable vi|ces, &s;hould be far removed from the eyes of the young American mi&s;&s;ionaries, who are to
<PB N="15" REF="14">
lead a life of poverty and &s;elf-denial among their countrymen.</P>
<P>After all, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that though every thing el&s;e &s;hould concur with our wi&s;hes, yet if a &s;et of good governors and teachers be wanting, who are acquainted with the methods of education, and have the zeal and ability requi&s;ite for carrying on a de&s;ign of this nature, it would certainly come to no|thing.</P>
<P>An in&s;titution of this kind &s;hould be &s;et on foot by men of prudence, &s;pirit, and zeal, as well as competent learning, who &s;hould be led to it by other motives than the nece&s;&s;ity of picking up a maintenance. For upon this view, what man of merit can be &s;uppo&s;ed to quit his native country, and take up with a poor college-&s;ub&s;i&s;tance in another part of the world, where there are &s;o many con&s;iderable pari&s;hes actually void, and &s;o many others ill &s;upplied for want of fitting incumbents? Is it likely, that fellow&s;hips of forty or fifty pounds a year &s;hould tempt abler or worthier men, than benefices of many times their value?</P>
<P>And except able and worthy men do fir&s;t engage in this affair, with a re&s;olution to ex|ert them&s;elves in forming the manners of the youth, and giving them a proper education, it is evident the mi&s;&s;ion and the college will be but in a very bad way. This inconvenience &s;eems the mo&s;t difficult to provide again&s;t, and, if not provided again&s;t, it will be the mo&s;t likely to ob&s;truct any de&s;ign of this na|ture. So true it is, that where ignorance or ill manners once take place in a &s;eminary, they
<PB N="16" REF="15">
are &s;ure to be handed down in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of illiterate or worthle&s;s men.</P>
<P>There are many in&s;tances of this in the Je&s;uite's colleges throughout Italy, where the noble&s;t foundations and the fine&s;t genius's in the world are quite lo&s;t by a wrong turn and ta&s;t in the regents. And to come nearer our pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, the &s;ame may be ob&s;erved in the two presbyterian colleges of New England, which have &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted to little or no purpo&s;e, if we may believe the accounts that are given of them. <HI>See Briti&s;h empire in America.</HI></P>
<P>But this apprehen&s;ion, which &s;eems &s;o well grounded, that a college in any part of America would either lie unprovided, or be wor&s;e provided than their churches are, hath no place in Bermuda; there being at this time &s;everal gentlemen, in all re&s;pects very well qualified, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of good pre|ferments, and fair pro&s;pects at home, who having &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered the great benefit that may ari&s;e to the church and to mankind from &s;uch an undertaking, are ready to en|gage in it, and to dedicate the remainder of their lives to the in&s;tructing the youth of A|merica, and pro&s;ecuting their own &s;tudies up|on a very moderate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in a retirement, &s;o &s;weet, and &s;o &s;ecure, and every way &s;o well fitted for a place of education, and &s;tudy, as Bermuda.</P>
<P>Thus much the writer hereof thought him|&s;elf obliged to &s;ay of his a&s;&s;ociates: For him|&s;elf, he can only &s;ay, that as he values no pre|ferment upon earth, &s;o much as that of being employed in the execution of this de&s;ign; &s;o he hopes to make up for other defects, by his in|du&s;try and zeal.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
In Europe, the prote&s;tant religion hath of late years con&s;iderably lo&s;t ground, and Ame|rica &s;eems the likelie&s;t place, wherein to make up for what hath been lo&s;t in Europe, provi|ded the proper methods are taken: Other|wi&s;e the Spani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries in the South, and the French in the North, are making &s;uch a progre&s;s, as may one day &s;pread the religion of Rome, and with it the u&s;ual hatred to pro|te&s;tants, throughout all the &s;avage nations in America; which would probably end in the utter extirpation of our colonies, on the &s;afe|ty whereof depends &s;o much of the nation's wealth, and &s;o con&s;iderable a branch of his maje&s;ty's revenue.</P>
<P>But if this &s;cheme were pur&s;ued, it would in all probability have much greater influence on the Americans, than the utmo&s;t endeavours of popi&s;h emi&s;&s;aries can po&s;&s;ibly have; who from the difference of country, language and inte|re&s;t, mu&s;t lie under far greater difficulties and di&s;couragements than tho&s;e, whom we &s;uppo&s;e yearly &s;ent out from Bermuda to preach a|mong their countrymen.</P>
<P>It cannot indeed be denied, that the great number of poor regulars inured to hard living, and brought up in an implicit obedience to their &s;uperiors, hath hitherto given the church of Rome, in regard to her mi&s;&s;ions, great advantage over the reformed churches. But from what hath been &s;aid, it is, I think, evi|dent, that this advantage may be over-bal|lanced by our employing American mi&s;&s;iona|ries.</P>
<P>Nor is the honour of the crown, nation, and church of England unconcerned in this
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;cheme; which, it is to be hoped, will re|move the reproach, we have &s;o long lain un|der, that we fall as far &s;hort of our neigh|bours of the Romi&s;h communion in zeal for propagating religion, as we &s;urpa&s;s them in the &s;oundne&s;s and purity of it. And at the &s;ame time, that the doing what may be &s;o ea&s;ily done, takes away our reproach; it will ca&s;t no &s;mall lu&s;tre on his maje&s;ty's reign, and derive a ble&s;&s;ing from heaven on his admini&s;tra|tion, and tho&s;e who live under the influence thereof.</P>
<P>Men of narrow minds have a peculiar ta|lent at objection, being never at a lo&s;s for &s;omething to &s;ay again&s;t what&s;oever is not of their own propo&s;ing. And perhaps, it will be &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to this propo&s;al, that if we thought our&s;elves capable of gaining converts to the church, we ought to begin with papi&s;ts, infidels, and di&s;&s;enters of all denominations at home, and to make pro&s;elytes of the&s;e, before we think of foreigners; and that therefore our &s;cheme is again&s;t duty. And further, that con&s;idering the great oppo&s;ition, which is &s;ound on the part of tho&s;e, who differ from us at home, no &s;ucce&s;s can be expected among &s;avages abroad, and that therefore it is again&s;t rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this I &s;ay, that religion like light is imparted without being dimini&s;hed. That whatever is done abroad, can be no hin|drance or let to the conver&s;ion of infidels and di&s;&s;enters at home. That tho&s;e who engage in this affair, imagine they will not be mi&s;&s;ed, where there is no want of &s;chools or clergy; but that they may be of &s;ingular &s;ervice in

countries, but thinly &s;upplied with either, or altogether deprived of both: That our colo|nies, being of the &s;ame blood, language, and religion with our&s;elves, are in effect our coun|trymen. But that chri&s;tian charity, not being limited by tho&s;e regards, doth extend to all mankind. And this may &s;erve for an an&s;wer to the fir&s;t point, that our de&s;ign is again&s;t du|ty.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd point I an&s;wer; that igno|rance is not &s;o incurable as error; that you mu&s;t pull down as well as build, era&s;e as well as imprint, in order to make pro&s;elytes at home: Whereas, the &s;avage Americans, if they are in a &s;tate purely natural and unimpro|ved by education, they are al&s;o unincumbred with all that rubbi&s;h of &s;uper&s;tition and pre|judice, which is the effect of a wrong one. As they are le&s;s in&s;tructed, they are withal le&s;s conceited, and more teachable. And not being violently attached to any fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of their own, are &s;o much the fitter to receive that which is true. Hence it is evident, that &s;ucce&s;s abroad ought not to be mea&s;ured by that which we ob&s;erve at home, and that the inference, which was made from the difficul|ty of the one to the impo&s;&s;ibility of the other, is altogether groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t true, notwith&s;tanding our pre&s;ent corruptions, that there are to be found in no country under the &s;un men of better inclina|tions or greater abilities for doing good than in England. But it is as true, that &s;ucce&s;s, in many ca&s;es, dependeth not upon zeal, indu&s;try, wealth, learning, or the like faculties, &s;o much as on the method, wherein the&s;e are applied.
<PB N="20" REF="19">
We often &s;ee a &s;mall proportion of labour and expence in one way, bring that about, which in others a much greater &s;hare of both could never effect. It hath been my endea|vour to di&s;cover this way or method in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e. What hath been done, I &s;ubmit to the judgment of all good and rea&s;onable men; who, I am per&s;uaded, will never reject or di&s;courage a propo&s;al of this nature on the &s;core of &s;light objections, &s;urmi&s;es, or diffi|culties, and thereby render them&s;elves charge|able with the having prevented tho&s;e good effects, which might otherwi&s;e have been pro|duced by it.</P>
<P>For it is, after all, po&s;&s;ible, that unfore|&s;een difficulties may ari&s;e in the pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, many things may retard, and ma|ny things may threaten to ob&s;truct it; but there is hardly any enterprize or &s;cheme what|&s;oever for the publick good, in which difficul|ties are not often &s;hewing them&s;elves, and as often overcome by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, upon the prudence and re&s;olution of the underta|kers: though, for ought that appears, the pre&s;ent &s;cheme is as likely to &s;ucceed, and at|tended with as few difficulties, as any of this kind can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>For to any man, who con&s;iders the divine power of religion, the innate force of rea&s;on and virtue, and the mighty effects often wrought by the con&s;tant regular operation e|ven of a weak and &s;mall cau&s;e; it will &s;eem natural and rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that rivulets perpetually i&s;&s;uing forth from a fountain, or re|&s;ervoir, of learning and religion, and &s;tream|ing thro' all parts of America, mu&s;t in due

time have a great effect, in purging away the ill manners and irreligion of our colonies, as well as the blindne&s;s and barbarity of the na|tions round them: E&s;pecially, if the re&s;ervoir be in a clean and private place, where its wa|ters, out of the way of any thing that may di&s;turb or muddy them, remain clear and pure: Otherwi&s;e, they are more likely to pollute than purify the places through which they flow.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who wi&s;h well to religion and man|kind, will need no other motive to forward an undertaking calculated for the &s;ervice of both: I &s;hall, neverthele&s;s, beg leave to ob&s;erve, that whoever would be glad to cover a multi|tude of &s;ins by an exten&s;ive and well judged charity, or whoever, from an excellent and godlike temper of mind, &s;eeks opportunities of doing good in his generation, will be plea&s;ed to meet with a &s;cheme that &s;o peculiarly puts it in his power, with &s;mall trouble or expence, to procure a great and la&s;ting benefit to the world.</P>
<P>Ten pounds a year, would (if I mi&s;take not) be &s;ufficient to defray the expence of a young American in the college of Bermuda, as to dyet, lodging, cloaths, books, and edu|cation: And if &s;o, the intere&s;t of two hun|dred pounds may be a perpetual fund for maintaining one mi&s;&s;ionary at the college for ever; and in this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, many, it is to be hoped, may become powerful in&s;truments for converting to chri&s;tianity and civil life whole nations, who now &s;it in darkne&s;s and the &s;ha|dow of death, and who&s;e cruel brutal man|ners are a di&s;grace to human nature.</P>

A benefaction of this kind &s;eems to enlarge the very being of a man, extending it to di|&s;tant places and to future times; ina&s;much as un&s;een countries, and after ages, may feel the effects of his bounty, while he him&s;elf reaps the reward in the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety of all tho&s;e, who, <HI>having turned many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hine as the &s;tars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
