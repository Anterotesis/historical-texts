<HEAD>Mr. MAITLAND's
Account of
INOCULATING
THE
Small Pox Vindicated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Am very Sen&s;ible of the Re&s;pect
that is due to the Profe&s;&s;ion, and
Character of the Author of the Let|ter
again&s;t <HI>Inoculating the Small
Pox</HI>; but am no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the Obli|gation
I lye under to vindicate my own Re|putation,
which a violent Fit of Sickne&s;s
hath hitherto hinder'd me from doing. And
I can do it with the more Freedom, be|cau&s;e
I am con&s;cious to my &s;elf, that I be|gan
this Practice in <HI>England</HI> with the &s;ame
View to the <HI>Publick Good,</HI> with which, I
hope, the Learned Author condemns it. I
mu&s;t take the Liberty to &s;ay, that allowing
the Doctor's Abilities to be as great as po&s;|&s;ible
in his own Profe&s;&s;ion, he &s;eems not
quite &s;o well qualify'd to write upon this
Subject; becau&s;e of the Narrowne&s;s of his
<PB N="2" REF="5">
Experience (as far as appears by his Letter)
and his partial Credulity, or Incredulity in
Matters of Fact, which he takes from others;
and la&s;tly, becau&s;e of &s;trong Prejudices, which
impo&s;e upon his mo&s;t excellent Under&s;tand|ing;
and draw him into Rea&s;onings, which
either are incon&s;equential, or conclude
&s;trongly for the Practice of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> which
they are brought to overturn. All the&s;e, I
believe, will appear very plain to any Im|partial
Reader, in the following <HI>Animad|ver&s;ions,</HI>
in which I will endeavour to be
as &s;hort as the Subject will allow.</P>
<P>The Letter pretends to be an Admonition
to Phy&s;icians not to meddle in this Practice
of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> 'till they are better a&s;cer|tain'd,
by Experience, of the Succe&s;s of it:
At the &s;ame Time, it is a mo&s;t warm Di&s;|&s;ua&s;ive,
not only to Phy&s;icians, but to all
Sorts of People, not to practi&s;e it at all;
and con&s;equently, to deprive them of all
Po&s;&s;ibility of coming by Experience. Would
it not found &s;omewhat ab&s;urd, if any one
&s;hould &s;ay to a young Phy&s;ician, Pray, Sir,
don't Practi&s;e 'till you have Experience? But
it is &s;till more &s;o in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e in
a Practice that is entirely to be laid a&s;ide,
you can neither have the Benefit of your
own, nor other Peoples Experience.</P>
<P>As to Phy&s;icians meddling with this Pra|ctice
of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> I can only &s;ay, it may
favour too much of Novelty to be bigotly
<PB N="3" REF="6">
zealous for it; and too much of a Faculty-Intere&s;t
to be &s;o violent again&s;t it. Phy&s;icians
cannot ingraft People again&s;t their own, or
their Parents Con&s;ent; and a Phy&s;ician would
be out of his Duty, who &s;hould per&s;uade them
to it contrary to their Inclinations: On the
other Hand, If a Per&s;on, from the Experience
of the Fatality of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in gene|ral,
or in his own Family in particular,
&s;hould re&s;olve to ingraft his Child, any
Phy&s;ician, who &s;hould di&s;&s;uade him from it,
might, in a great mea&s;ure, be chargeable
with the fatal Con&s;equences of the Neg|lect
of a Method, which the Parent had pro|pos'd,
as the only Moans to &s;ave his Child's
Life: And he would be &s;till as much to
blame, if when the Parent had re&s;olv'd to
ingraft his Child, he &s;hould refu&s;e to attend
him. It is very common with Parents, not
only to leave their Children in Hou&s;es in|fected
with the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> but to bring
them into the Room, where their Brethren
or Si&s;ters lye ill of them; and a Parent who
does &s;o, conveys the Infection to his Child
as deliberately, and according to the Doctor,
certainly more than he, who orders him to be
<HI>Inoculated.</HI> Would it not then be equally,
impertinent in the Phy&s;ician to deny his
Attendance in either Ca&s;e?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t put the Doctor in Mind, that there
are very few of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Di&s;coveries
in Phy&s;ick, that have not been &s;trenuou&s;ly
<PB N="4" REF="7">
oppos'd by many of the Faculty upon their
fir&s;t Appearance. There is extant a Decree
of the College of Phy&s;icians at <HI>Paris,</HI> a|gain&s;t
the U&s;e of Antimonial Vomits: It
were ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign many In&s;tances of the
like Nature.</P>
<P>As the Doctor is &s;urpriz'd, <HI>that an Ex|periment,
practis'd only by a few ignorant
Women, among&s;t an illiterate and unthinking
People, &s;hould on a Sudden, and upon a &s;len|der
Experience, &s;o far obtain in one of the
Polite&s;t Nations in the World, as to be receiv'd
into the Royal Palace.</HI> I hope he has not
forgot, that the Practice of Curing Inter|mitting
Fevers by the BARK, was intro|duc'd
of a Sudden, by a barbarous <HI>Indian,</HI>
if not into the Royal Family, into the Family
of a Viceroy; and thence tran&s;mitted to us.</P>
<P>Page 7.] The <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h if
we &s;peak of it as National, is the Product
of the riche&s;t Dyet,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ergo,</HI> to bring 'em
to a &s;pare Dyet before they have the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> mu&s;t be extremely dangerous and hurt|ful.
This mu&s;t be the Doctor's Conclu&s;ion:
mine, I own, would be the direct contradi|ctory.
If the Inflammatory State of the Blood,
ari&s;ing from the Richne&s;s of the Dyet, makes
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in <HI>England</HI> very mortal; That
Practice, which either takes the Advantage
of a contrary State of the Blood, or by a
Spare Dyet introduces it, mu&s;t be benefi|cial.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">
Page 8.] <HI>The fine&s;t, the mo&s;t Volatile, and
indeed, In&s;en&s;ible Particles of the Animal
Juices, are the mo&s;t penetrating, and con&s;e|quently
the mo&s;t contagious.</HI> And for the
&s;ame Rea&s;on, the mo&s;t <HI>noxious:</HI> Does it
follow therefore, To convey the Infection
by the gro&s;&s;er and &s;en&s;ible Parts, mu&s;t be ex|tremely
unfit and dangerous? I confe&s;s, I
&s;hould have inferr'd the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>The Symptoms are more or le&s;s, and the
Di&s;temper appears in a greater, or a le&s;s
Degree, according to the State of the Blood
at the Time of Infection.</HI> Therefore the Pra|ctice
of <HI>Inoculation</HI> is highly to be encou|raged,
becau&s;e it either finds, or puts the
Blood into a good State, before the Infe|ction;
&s;eems to be a more natural Conclu|&s;ion,
than the contrary One.</P>
<P>Page 10.] <HI>If we could be a&s;&s;ur'd, that the
Di&s;temper would not be equally uncertain by</HI>
Inoculation, <HI>according to the Nature of the
Injected Matter, or the Di&s;po&s;ition of the
Fluids, in the Per&s;on who receives it; &s;o
that it would con&s;tantly prove of the mild|e&s;t
Kind,</HI> Inoculation <HI>would, no doubt, be
a very rational and u&s;eful Practice.</HI> The
Doctor &s;urely will not affirm, that a Per&s;on
<HI>Inoculated</HI> is equally uncertain of the Cir|cum&s;tances
mention'd, with one who catch|es
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by the common Way of
Infection. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He may be a&s;&s;ur'd, if the
<HI>Inoculation</HI> takes Place, of the Time when
<PB N="6" REF="9">
he &s;hall have the <HI>Small Pox. Secondly,</HI> That
he has not the Infection by the in&s;en&s;ible
Particles, which the Doctor owns to be the
mo&s;t contagious; or which is near the &s;ame
Thing, convey the Contagion the &s;tronge&s;t,
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> He may be as &s;ure, as his Operator
is careful, that he is infected by a favour|able
Kind. And, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> He may be much
more &s;ure of the Di&s;po&s;ition of his Fluids,
than a Per&s;on who catches them by Chance,
after a Surfeit, or a Debauch: And after all
this, he may be a&s;&s;ur'd, if he has not ab&s;o|lute
Certainty, (which, I believe, one has
hardly in Blood-letting) that he has a much
greater Probability to e&s;cape, which is &s;uffi|cient
Ground for human Prudence to act
upon: If the Doctor will deny tho&s;e Things,
I think it is Folly to rea&s;on upon this Sub|ject
any longer: And if, as the Doctor &s;ays,
Inoculation <HI>may be a more uncertain Me|thod
to give the Contagion, than that which
Nature has pur&s;u'd</HI>; it may be, notwith|&s;tanding
that, much more &s;afe.</P>
<P>Page 11.] <HI>The very Choice that is made
of a thick purulent Matter, to intermix im|mediately
with the Blood, &s;eems a little re|pugnant
to our Rea&s;on, &s;ince we know, that
the Particles have &s;uch a different Contex|ture,
and &s;uch different Powers to Attract.</HI>
It may proceed from my Ignorance, or Dul|ne&s;s,
but, I confe&s;s, I do not ea&s;ily appre|hend
the Meaning of this Sentence; Whe|ther
<PB N="7" REF="10">
by <HI>the Particles</HI> he means the Parti|cles
of purulent Matter, or the Particles of
Blood; or whether the Particles of purulent
Matter have different attractive Powers, from
tho&s;e of the Blood, is not obvious from the
Con&s;truction of the Sentence. I chu&s;e ra|ther
to under&s;tand him in the la&s;t Sen&s;e, be|cau&s;e
he has afterwards very &s;agaciou&s;ly di&s;|cover'd,
<HI>That the blended Particles of Blood
with Blood, may, in all Rea&s;on, be thought
more likely to unite, and le&s;s liable to rai&s;e
Commotions.</HI> But it happens unluckily in the
Ca&s;e of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> the De&s;ign is to <HI>rai&s;e a
Commotion</HI>; and the purulent Matter, for
the Rea&s;on mention'd by him, is fitte&s;t for
that Purpo&s;e; And his Ob&s;ervation, that <HI>pur|ging
Medicines injected into the Blood will
Purge,</HI> does not prove, that the <HI>Pus</HI> of the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> mix'd with the Blood, may not
rai&s;e the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> What he &s;ays in this
Paragraph, as likewi&s;e in the following, con|cerning
the Experiment of the <HI>Mangey Dog,</HI>
proves, that <HI>Pus</HI> is a more proper Vehicle
to convey Infection than Blood; I cannot
find any more in it.</P>
<P>Page 13.] <HI>It never came into the Heads</HI>
of the Practitioners above-mention'd <HI>to rai&s;e
Di&s;tempers by Art in a human Body.</HI> Then
I will be bold to &s;ay, it never came into
their Heads to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick; which, con|&s;ider'd
in a true Light, is founded upon that
&s;ingle Principle of Curing <HI>Natural,</HI> by rai&s;|ing
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<HI>Artificial Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> What is Bleeding,
but an artificial Haemorrhagy; Purging, but
rai&s;ing an artificial Diarrhaea? Does the Vo|miting
produc'd by a Surfeit, and that pro|cur'd
by a Medicine differ &s;o much, as that
the One mu&s;t be call'd a Di&s;ea&s;e, and the O|ther
not? Are not Bli&s;ters, I&s;&s;ues, and Setons,
artificial <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Impo&s;thumations? I hope he has
not forgot the of his great Ma|&s;ter
<HI>Hippocrates.</HI> The Wounds and Ampu|tations
of Surgeons, differ only from acci|dental
Ones, by the Manner and Intention;
<HI>Morbus e&s;t ille corporis &s;tatus qui functiones
Animales laedit:</HI> And it may be likewi&s;e
ob&s;erv'd, that Phy&s;icians produce tho&s;e Di|&s;ea&s;es
in their Patients often by Way of
Prevention as well as Cure; and in this
they do nothing but imitate Nature, which
often attempts the Cure of one Di&s;ea&s;e by
another.</P>
<P>Page 14.] His next Argument is taken
from <HI>the fatal Con&s;equences of this very
Matter it &s;elf returning into the Blood, in
the very Height of the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>where
there &s;eldom is a full and &s;ufficient Di&s;charge
by the Skin,</HI> &amp;c. One would imagine, that
the natural Inference from this, would be
to the Advantage of <HI>Inoculation</HI>; For if
there are terrible Symptoms, which ari&s;e
from Want of a &s;ufficient Di&s;charge of the
purulent Matter in the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; <HI>Inocu|lation,</HI>
which provides for &s;uch a Di&s;charge,
<PB N="9" REF="12">
by artificial Out-lets, mu&s;t needs be u&s;eful;
and &s;eems more proper than the Bli&s;ters,
which the Phy&s;icians apply on that Occa|&s;ion.
As to the <HI>fatal Con&s;equences ari&s;ing for
Want of a &s;ufficient Di&s;charge upon the Skin,</HI>
I am affraid the Ca&s;e is quite different from
what the Doctor repre&s;ents; for the more
Matter is di&s;charg'd upon the Skin, the more
is often return'd into the Blood; witne&s;s the
<HI>confluent</HI> Kind of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> where the Di&s;|charge
upon the Skin, as well as the Symp|toms
ari&s;ing from the Return of the Mat|ter
into the Blood, are both the greate&s;t:
And I believe it will be found, the le&s;s the
Di&s;charge upon the Skin, the le&s;s will be
the Danger from the&s;e Symptoms. The Do|ctor
&s;ays, <HI>That one may always ob&s;erve in
this artificial Method (even where the Di|&s;temper
is the faire&s;t and mo&s;t kindly) that
the Pu&s;tules &s;carce ever plump up to that
Degree, or contain &s;o laudable a Matter, as
they do in the natural Sort.</HI> Here is an odd
Jumble of the Words <HI>always, &s;carce ever:</HI>
Suppo&s;e for <HI>&s;carce ever</HI> one put <HI>&s;eldom,</HI> then
the Sentence runs thus; <HI>One may always
ob&s;erve the Pu&s;tules &s;eldom plump up,</HI> &amp;c.
What happens but &s;eldom, happens &s;ome|times;
and to ob&s;erve <HI>always That</HI> not to
happen, which happens &s;ometimes, is odd,
or oddly expre&s;s'd. I would be glad to know
how many Ca&s;es the Doctor has ob&s;erv'd,
to frame this &s;o general a Propo&s;ition upon;
<PB N="10" REF="13">
of the contrary of which, Hundreds of Per|&s;ons
about this Town, who know the Di|&s;ea&s;e
perfectly, have been Eye-Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Page 16.] The Doctor fore&s;ees &s;ome Incon|venience
that mu&s;t happen, from tho&s;e <HI>vi&s;|cid
Particles</HI> intermixing with the Blood,
without undergoing the common Alterations
of Aliment. But they have that in common
with the <HI>Volatile</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>In&s;en&s;ible Parti|cles.</HI>
But then they are <HI>vi&s;cid,</HI> and therefore,
(according to the Doctor's Rea&s;oning) don't
convey the Infection &s;o &s;trong: But they <HI>oc|ca&s;ion
great Di&s;orders</HI>; Not &s;o great as the
<HI>In&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>Volatile Particles.</HI> At la&s;t,
they <HI>break through the Glands of the Skin:</HI>
If only the &s;mall Quantity of purulent Mat|ter,
that mixes with the Blood, break thro'
the Pores of the Skin, the Eruption, indeed,
would be very &s;mall; But to cau&s;e an Erup|tion,
is the very Intention of the Operation;
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> cannot be produc'd without
it: And if the Doctor &s;till in&s;i&s;ts, that it is
<HI>only like the</HI> Small Pox; all I can &s;ay is, If
he had been pleas'd to attend Multitudes of
Ca&s;es of <HI>Inoculated Per&s;ons,</HI> here and el&s;e|where
in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince this Practice began,
he mu&s;t have been convinc'd, that the <HI>Erup|tions,</HI>
produc'd by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> are the <HI>Ge|nuine
Small Pox.</HI> If his Arguments &s;o far
prevail, as to hinder any future <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
he mu&s;t for ever continue in his Mi&s;take; If
the Patient recovers, then it was only &s;ome|thing
<PB N="11" REF="14">
like the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; If any one dies,
then to be &s;ure it was the <HI>Small Pox</HI> catch'd
by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> and of the wor&s;t Sort. In
this Paragraph it is no <HI>Small Pox</HI>; by and
by, it is a <HI>Small Pox</HI> &s;o bad, that it is capa|ble
of <HI>&s;preading the</HI> Small Pox through <HI>a
whole City; and an artificial Way of depo|pulating
a whole Country.</HI> This Way of Ar|guing
is a very plain Proof of the &s;trong Pre|judices
the Doctor lyes under; and that as he
has taken up his Opinion early, he is re&s;olv'd
to defend it ob&s;tinately.</P>
<P>Page 20.] The <HI>Inoculators</HI> are charg'd with
<HI>Acting like Empirics,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>they are not
a&s;certain'd of the different Do&s;es for Chil|dren
and Adults.</HI> There does not &s;eem to
be any great Matter in this Nicety, by Ex|perience,
as it &s;tands hitherto; a &s;mall Quan|tity
will communicate the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and
a greater has been found not to do hurt in a|ny
one In&s;tance. If the <HI>Inoculation</HI> is per|form'd
by Inci&s;ion, the different Apertures
will an&s;wer that Intention: However, there
is a great Difference between recommending
Caution, and forbidding the Practice: It is
&s;till more &s;trange to forbid the Practice, 'till
that is determin'd, which can only be found
out by Practice. According to this Princi|ple,
it had been impo&s;&s;ible ever to have
found out any Thing in Medicine; for he
that gave the fir&s;t Do&s;e of a Vomiting, or
Purging Medicine, or of any other, could
<PB N="12" REF="15">
never be &s;ure of the proper Do&s;e; nay far|ther,
according to this Doctrine, it is impo&s;|&s;ible
to give any Body their fir&s;t Do&s;e of any
Medicine: For who can tell what is the pro|per
Do&s;e for any particular Per&s;on, there be|ing
often Singularities in every one's Con&s;ti|tution:
In all the&s;e Matters, Mankind ge|nerally
govern them&s;elves by common Sen&s;e,
and &s;trong Probabilities; there being no ab|&s;olute
Certainty in any human Affairs.</P>
<P>Page 25.] The Doctor returns to his for|mer
Point, that it is <HI>not the Genuine</HI> Small
Pox, <HI>and con&s;equently no Security again&s;t that
Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> The Matters of Fact I will an&s;wer
by them&s;elves; all I &s;hall &s;ay at pre&s;ent is,
that if the Symptoms of the Ingrafted <HI>Small
Pox</HI> are more mild, than tho&s;e of the natu|ral
Sort, I hope the Doctor will not bring
that as an Objection again&s;t the Practice. I
believe the Patient, in this Ca&s;e, has ju&s;t as
great Certainty for not having the <HI>Small Pox</HI>
again, as any other Per&s;on who has had them;
<HI>which is no ab&s;olute one.</HI> Tho&s;e who are In|fected
by any Method, I believe, are much
in the &s;ame Condition, as to their Security
from the Di&s;ea&s;e for the future; for which,
I will give the Doctor this one plain Proof,
which is &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a moral Cer|tainty.
This Practice of <HI>Inoculation</HI> has been
continu'd for many Years in &s;everal Countries;
if the <HI>Inoculated</HI> had been &s;ubject to catch
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> a &s;econd Time, &s;omething
<PB N="13" REF="16">
of this Kind mu&s;t have happen'd; and a very
few In&s;tances of this, mu&s;t have put an End
to the whole Practice: For can any one ima|gine,
that People in their Sen&s;es would have
continu'd a trouble&s;ome Experiment, which
was not effectual for the Purpo&s;e for which
it was de&s;ign'd? I will take the Freedom to
&s;ay, that this &s;ingle Reflection is a &s;tronger
Proof of this Point, than all the Doctor's
Doubts and Sugge&s;tions, who knows nothing
to the contrary; as I &s;hall &s;hew by and
by. May it not at lea&s;t be advi&s;eable to al|low
a Truce in the Di&s;pute, 'till an uncon|te&s;ted
Ca&s;e of that Kind happens?</P>
<P>Page 28.] But, Innoculation <HI>does not al|ways
take Place and produce the Di&s;ea&s;e:</HI>
is Therefore the Practice to be left off? There
are &s;ome Per&s;ons, who by a Speciality of
their Con&s;titutions, &s;eem hardly &s;u&s;ceptible
of the Di&s;temper; and others, who have had
the Di&s;ea&s;e, but it has been mi&s;taken, or
forgot. They go farther in <HI>Turky,</HI> and af|firm,
that the very running Sores are a Secu|rity
again&s;t the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> There may be,
indeed, a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, that Per&s;ons,
who have had &s;o &s;evere a Tryal as <HI>Inocula|tion,</HI>
may not be &s;u&s;ceptible of the Di&s;temper.
Be&s;ides, there are &s;everal Incidents in perform|ing
the Operation, which may not be carefully
attended to; if the Patient has not the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> there is little Hurt done. There
are &s;ome, whom a very &s;trong Do&s;e of Phy|&s;ick
<PB N="14" REF="17">
will not purge: What then? mu&s;t we
never afterwards give a Purge?</P>
<P>If the Doctor's Aphori&s;m, laid down, <HI>Page</HI>
36, That an <HI>Experiment, to make it u&s;eful,
always mu&s;t be nearly uniform</HI>; there mu&s;t
be no &s;uch Thing as the Practice of Phy&s;ick;
unle&s;s by the Word <HI>nearly</HI> he allows a very
great Latitude.</P>
<P>I cannot allow it as a &s;olid Argument a|gain&s;t
<HI>Inoculation,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Ita|lians</HI>
have not begun it; no more, than that
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> has never been <HI>Ino|culated.</HI>
Were the Doctor's Letter publi&s;h'd
in <HI>Italian</HI> too, as it is in very elegant <HI>French,</HI>
both Nations, to be &s;ure, will be &s;ufficiently
frighten'd from ever attempting this Practice:
And to make the Antidote &s;till more univer|&s;al,
let us have it in <HI>Sclavonic</HI> and <HI>High-Dutch,</HI>
<HI>Wel&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>What the Doctor &s;ays, <HI>Page</HI> 44, of <HI>the
Attention that is to be given to the na|tural
Weakne&s;&s;es of the Con&s;titutions of the
Per&s;ons</HI> Inoculated, is a very proper Cau|tion;
and perhaps Mi&s;carriages, if any &s;uch
there be, may be owing to the Neglect of
it. But, as I hinted before, if the lea&s;t ill
Succe&s;s, even in the mo&s;t innocent Branch|es
of the Practice of Phy&s;ick, ari&s;ing from
Want of Care, or Skill, &s;hould be a per|petual
<HI>Bar</HI> to the Repitition of them, Peo|ple
mu&s;t leave off to Purge, Vomit, Bleed,
or even to cut Corns, of which Operation
<PB N="15" REF="18">
&s;everal die in a Year within the Bills of
Mortality.</P>
<P>Page 45.] But it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible, and even pro|bable,
the Matter of the</HI> Small Pox <HI>may
communicate the Di&s;ea&s;es of the People
from which it is taken.</HI> This is hard! The
Doctor will &s;carcely allow, that the Matter of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> will communicate the <HI>Small
Pox</HI>; but it is <HI>probable,</HI> that it will commu|nicate
any other <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e. Que vive</HI> Thomas
Diaphoinus, <HI>il n'a Jamais ete vaincu en di&s;|pute!</HI>
How are we &s;ure, that the Aliment,
or Drugs, both for External and Internal U|&s;es,
don't communicate the Di&s;ea&s;es; nay,
the very natural Qualities of tho&s;e Animals
from which they are taken? I think, indeed,
the Election of whol&s;ome Subjects to <HI>Ino|culate
from,</HI> is a proper Caution; but the
Doctor demands ab&s;olute Certainty, which
cannot be found in any human Affair, and
le&s;s &s;till in any Medical or Chyrurgical Pra|ctice.
Mankind in all tho&s;e Matters govern
them&s;elves by the &s;tronge&s;t Probabilities; and
that the&s;e are on the Side of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> I
&s;hall plainly demon&s;trate.</P>
<P>Page 51.] The Doctor's Argument from
the <HI>jarring Opinions</HI> of the <HI>Innoculators</HI>; if
all he &s;ays were true, is ju&s;t as &s;trong again&s;t
the Practice of Phy&s;ick in General: For if
no Body was to take any Medicine 'till <HI>Do|ctors
cea&s;e to differ,</HI> I believe the Faculty
would &s;tarve: May we not with more Truth
<PB N="16" REF="19">
affirm, that the <HI>Anti-inoculators</HI> (a Word
more &s;onorous, and longer by two Syllables
than that of <HI>Inoculators</HI>) are as incon&s;i&s;tent
and changeable in their Opinions? One
while they a&s;&s;erted, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to
give the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by this Method; when
Experience had convinc'd them, &s;ome of 'em
at lea&s;t, of the Untenablene&s;s of this Do|ctrine;
then they allow'd, if it prov'd mor|tal,
that it was the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; if they e&s;ca|ped,
to be &s;ure they would have them again;
If it was a favourable Sort, then there was
&s;ome inveterate Di&s;temper tran&s;planted with
it; If any Boils or Impo&s;thumations appear'd
at the going off of the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> tho&s;e were
the Effect of the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> not the Con|&s;equence
of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in General, or
of the Con&s;titution of the Patient. The&s;e
are certainly, not the Rea&s;onings of inge|nious
and inqui&s;itive Philo&s;ophers, but the
Cavils of intere&s;ted Di&s;putants; and it would
be ridiculous, for any Man to be determin'd
by the jarring Opinions, either of the one
Side or t'other.</P>
<P>There is nothing material in the Way of
Argumentation, 'till we come to <HI>Page</HI> 62.
There this <HI>Practice</HI> is condemn'd, as it tends
to propagate and continue an Infection in
any Place: Here again it is the <HI>Small Pox</HI>;
el&s;e why &s;hould it &s;pread the <HI>Small Pox?</HI>
I an&s;wer, if it be true, that the Generality
of Mankind have the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; if they
<PB N="17" REF="20">
are rare in &s;ome Years, they mu&s;t be ri&s;e in
others; becau&s;e a new Stock of Subjects
&s;u&s;ceptible of the Di&s;temper is produc'd; and
the Operation of this Di&s;temper upon the
Ma&s;s of Mankind in any particular Place, is
nearly uniform. When this general Run of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> happens; I take it to be indif|ferent
to the Ma&s;s of the Inhabitants of any
Place in general, except in this one particu|lar,
that when the Di&s;ea&s;e is produc'd by a
bad Con&s;titution of Air, as it is mo&s;t Epide|mical,
&s;o it is then mo&s;t mortal. Now if
this Di&s;temper &s;hould happen to be propaga|ted
by an artificial Method in a favourable
Sea&s;on, would not this be rather an Advan|tage
to Mankind than otherwi&s;e? For exam|ple,
The Doctor alledgeth that hardly one
of a hundred hath dy'd of the natural Sort
this Year; would it not then have been
highly profitable to Mankind, that a general
Run of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> had happen'd in &s;o fa|vourable
a Sea&s;on; and this would &s;till ope|rate
more &s;trongly for the Benefit of Man|kind,
if not only the Sea&s;on, but the Method
of Propagation had ten to one of odds of
producing a mild Sort. So that this Argu|ment
of the Doctor's has the Misfortune,
with a great many of the re&s;t, to prove the
Contradictory of his Conclu&s;ion: But with|out
taking the Advantage of the Doctor's
hardy A&s;&s;ertion, that hardly one of a hun|dred
have dy'd this Year of the <HI>Small Pox:</HI>

<P>By which it appears that the &s;ingle Branch of
Mortality occa&s;ion'd by the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is
&s;ome Years 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in a Circle of twelve
Years about 1/12 of the whole Mortality in ge|neral;
For 21,788 is near 1/12 of 274,615.
During this Term of Years, <HI>London</HI> wanted
an Addition of near 22000 People yearly to
keep it equally full. If all Mankind had the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> then 22000 People, one Year
with another had it; of which 1/12 dy'd; If
<PB N="19" REF="22">
one half of Mankind had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
then 1 out of 6, who had the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI>
dy'd of it. Which, by the way, &s;hows the
Doctor to be out in his Calculation; for if
only 1000 die this Year, as perhaps may ap|pear
by the Bills, 100,000 mu&s;t have been
&s;ick of the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> to make his A&s;&s;ertion
true, <HI>that one only of a hundred dy'd:</HI> If he
means it only of Children, it is a &s;trong Argu|ment
for <HI>Inoculation,</HI> becau&s;e it allows that
to be a favourable Age.</P>
<P>By the Bills of Mortality of <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> it ap|pears,
that the Ma&s;s of Mankind lo&s;e above
25 <HI>per Cent,</HI> before they are a Year old; that
is, of a 100 that are born, more than 25 die
that fir&s;t Year: I may &s;ay with great Proba|bility
that not 1/9 of tho&s;e have the <HI>Small Pox</HI>
at all; but die of other <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>; and that
in the Account, as it &s;tands before us 8 of 9
of Infants may be reckon'd neither Subjects
of the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> nor of this Practice, but
as it were <HI>non-Entities.</HI> Therefore out of
the 22000 People, the yearly Recruits of
<HI>London</HI> abovemention'd, &s;ub&s;tracting 4000,
there remains 18000, of which yearly there
died above 1800 of the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; that is,
1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">: So that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> may be reckon'd
to cut off 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Mankind above the Age of
one Year. I wi&s;h the World is not malicious
enough to &s;ay, that Phy&s;icians (like the
Clergy) are now &s;trugling for their Tenths.
But to proceed, If, as I &s;aid, all Mankind a|bove
<PB N="20" REF="23">
a Year old have the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> I out
of 10 dies of it; If one half, then 1 out of 5,
which have the <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> the natural way,
dies of it: If &frac14; of Mankind have the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> once in their Life, then of them 2 out
of 15 die: If 5/6, then 3 out of 25, which have
the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> die of it. According to D. <HI>Net|tleton</HI>'s
Calculation; out of 1245 who had
the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> in &s;ome Neighbour|ing
Towns in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> there died 270, which
is about 22 out of a hundred. As to the pru|dential
Part of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> it is all one whe|ther
a greater or le&s;&s;er Number have the <HI>Small
Pox</HI>; for the Chance of not dying by the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> the natural Way, is made up of
the Chance of e&s;caping the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> and
that of e&s;caping in the <HI>Di&s;temper.</HI> If &frac12; of Man|kind
have the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> it is &frac12; of &frac15; or 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;
If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">/4 of Mankind have the <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> then it
is &frac34; &times; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> or 6/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> or 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Still all Mankind
mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd with the Seeds of a Di&s;|temper
within them which has the Chance
of 1 to 9 to cut them, off. Then &s;urely they
don't merit &s;uch hard Names, of <HI>Homicides
and Spreaders of Infection,</HI> who do but at|tempt
to le&s;&s;en the Dread and Danger of this
terrible Pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>By the Accounts of the <HI>Inoculation in Eng|land</HI>
and the <HI>Plantations,</HI> tho' it is an early
Practice, and has not been manag'd with due
Care and Circum&s;pection; out of about 500
on whom it has been perform'd, the Enemies
<PB N="21" REF="24">
of the Practice have not produc'd the Names
of above 3 Per&s;ons that have died; allowing
their Deaths chargeable on this Practice,
which I believe is not in Fact true: A Pra|ctice
which brings the Mortality of the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> from one in ten to one in a hundred, if
it obtain'd univer&s;ally would &s;ave to the Ci|ty
of <HI>London</HI> at lea&s;t 1500 People yearly;
and the &s;ame Odds wou'd be a &s;ufficient pru|dential
Motive to any private Per&s;on to pro|ceed
upon, ab&s;tracting from the more occult
and ab&s;tru&s;e Cau&s;es which &s;eem to favour
this Operation. It is a &s;elf evident Propo&s;i|tion,
that a Per&s;on who receives the Infe|ction
by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> has a much fairer
Chance for his Life, than he who takes it
the natural Way; unle&s;s it can be affirmed,
that the having the Election of all the Cir|com&s;tances
of the Di&s;ea&s;e, is of no manner
of Advantage. For Example, it mu&s;t be of
&s;ome Benefit, to know that one is to have
the Di&s;temper nine or ten Dayes before it
comes; rather than to be &s;urpris'd, or per|haps
mi&s;taken in it. To have it at an Age
when it is not &s;o mortal: To take it when
the Body is in a temperate and cool State, ra|ther
than in a contrary one: When the Con|&s;titution
of the Air is favourable, rather than
malignant: After a cool Dyet and other due
Preparations, rather than after a Surfeit or a
drunken Bout. For if the principal Strokes
towards the Cure, are in the Regimen, in the
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Beginning of a Di&s;temper; it mu&s;t be &s;till
more &s;o, in a Regimen before it begins. If
the Doctor will deny the&s;e Truths, I have
done. But if the having all the Circum&s;tan|ces
abovemention'd in one's Power be of
&s;ome Advantage, then the <HI>Practice of Ino|culation</HI>
cannot be hurtfull but beneficial to
Mankind in general: Then why mu&s;t an Ex|periment
already practis'd with Succe&s;s in an|other
Country, that bids fair to &s;ave the
Lives of Multitudes, be entirely laid a&s;ide
and cru&s;h'd in the Bud? Cannot the learned
Phy&s;icians, who &s;o zealou&s;ly oppo&s;e it, have
a little Patience, and Time will clear up ma|ny
Things in it, which perhaps may be now
doubtful? Therefore &s;ince this Practice can|not
be hurtful but beneficial to Mankind in
general, it ought not to be di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>As to the Incon&s;i&s;tencies and Mi&s;takes, the
Doctor is pleas'd to charge me withall: I &s;hall
always be &s;o ingenuous as to own &s;uch, as
my Inadvertency or Want of Experience
have &s;ubjected me to. What I wrote was ac|cording
to the be&s;t Information or Expe|rience
I had at that Time. General Propo|&s;itions,
in practical Matters, are not to be
under&s;tood in the Strictne&s;s of a Logical U|niver&s;ality.
The Symptoms from which I
exempted the Inoculated <HI>Small Pox,</HI> are to
be under&s;tood in a Comparative Sen&s;e, with
regard to tho&s;e of the natural Sort; the
Word <HI>u&s;ual</HI> will ju&s;tify this Meaning, in
<PB N="23" REF="26">
which any Reader, not quite Captious, will
interpret them. If with all the&s;e Re&s;trictions
I cannot be favourably under&s;tood, I beg Par|don;
and as I &s;aid before, I &s;hall be always
willing to recant any Mi&s;take. But as on the
one hand, I &s;tudy to keep my&s;elf free from
Prejudices, &s;o as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of any fu|ture
Conviction, which may ari&s;e from <HI>Ex|perience</HI>;
&s;o I wou'd not &s;ubmit a Point al|ready
e&s;tabli&s;h'd, to the &s;illy Cavils of tho&s;e
who have none.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, I am not mi&s;taken in the
Account of the <HI>Inoculation</HI> at <HI>Newgate</HI>;
but the Doctor is. I referr the Reader
to my printed <HI>Journal</HI>; whereby it ap|pears,
that the Operation was fairly and
equally perform'd on all: And I can with
great Truth, declare, that I had no Intention
to make any Difference in the Inci&s;ions; nor
was there, indeed, any made. The Doctor
not having &s;een <HI>Evans,</HI> the Man who had
had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before, till next Day, when
they were partly heal'd, this might occa|&s;ion
his Mi&s;take. Nor was the Matter taken
from a violent Flux-kind, but from a full
di&s;tinct Coherent kind, and at the proper
Time. Mrs. <HI>Tompions</HI> Boil (as he call's it)
on her Arm; was not the &s;ame from the fir&s;t
Day of the Eruption; nor the only one &s;he
had: But was a fair, regular Pu&s;tule of the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> of which al&s;o &s;he had others, if
he had been pleas'd to examine. <HI>Alcock,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="27">
who had the <HI>Goal-Di&s;temper,</HI> had al&s;o 60
Pu&s;tules, at lea&s;t, of the <HI>Genuine Small Pox</HI>;
with a gentle Fever before the Eruption.
As to all of them, having had but few Erup|tions;
I hope, that is no Objection again&s;t
the Practice. And as to the Time and Man|ner
of their Pu&s;tules going off; they were
much the &s;ame, as in the gentler Sort of
<HI>Small Pox:</HI> Only that <HI>Alcock</HI> opening his
with a Pin, made them fall off &s;ooner. The
Doctor might have taken Notice, that <HI>Eliz.
Harri&s;on,</HI> who had them as gently, at lea&s;t,
as any of them; has been employ'd &s;ince in
Nur&s;ing above 20 People in the <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
and never has catch'd them: Which any im|partial
Per&s;on will judge to be a better Proof
of the Genuinne&s;s of the Di&s;temper, than all
his Ob&s;ervations can evince to the contrary.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n</HI>'s Ca&s;e, it is true. But
the Inference is only, that there was one Per|&s;on,
on whom the <HI>Inoculation</HI> did not take
place. I hope the Doctor has not forgot that
he own'd to me that Mr. <HI>Colt</HI>'s Children had
the true <HI>Small Pox</HI>; tho' their Ca&s;e differ'd
in nothing from tho&s;e in <HI>Newgate</HI>; but in
the Degrees of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>As to the Experiment in St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;|pital,</HI>
after two va&s;tly large Inci&s;ions, and
an immoderate Quantity of the Matter ap|play'd;
three Days and Nights Confinement
of the Patient to his Bed, without opening
his Bandage, a warm Regimen, in a hot Sea|&s;on;
<PB N="25" REF="28">
I vi&s;ited him, (to know the Truth of
the Noi&s;e that was made) on the &s;ixth Day
after the Operation, and &s;aw no Eruptions,
nor had he any; nor were his Inci&s;ions di|ge&s;ted:
I took the Freedom to ask Doctor
<HI>Wad&s;worth</HI> then pre&s;ent, whether the Sores
(pointing at them) were like tho&s;e he &s;aw
at <HI>Newgate?</HI> And he fairly own'd, he cou'd
not &s;ay they were. I again &s;aw this Patient
a Week after, but &s;till no Eruption; If any
Eruptions happen'd between the&s;e Times,
they could not be the <HI>Small Pox:</HI> And I be|lieve,
none who &s;aw and attended both Ex|periments,
can truly &s;ay, they were like tho&s;e
in <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>I own that it &s;eem'd probable that the &s;ix
Per&s;ons in Mr. <HI>Batt</HI>'s Family might have
catch'd the <HI>Small Pox</HI> of the Girl that was
<HI>Inoculated</HI>; but it is well known that the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> were rife not only at <HI>Hertford,</HI>
but in &s;everal Villages round it, many
Months before any Per&s;on was <HI>Inoculated</HI>
there: Witne&s;s Mr. <HI>Dobb</HI>'s Hou&s;e in <HI>Chri&s;t's
Ho&s;pital</HI> Buildings, where he him&s;elf died
of the wor&s;t Sort with Purples; and his
Children had it. Some other Families there,
and particularly Mrs. <HI>Mo&s;s</HI>'s, where the a|bove-named
<HI>Elizabeth Harri&s;on, Inoculated</HI>
in <HI>Newgate,</HI> attended &s;everal Per&s;ons under
it, to prove whether &s;he would catch the Di|&s;temper
by Infection; Both <HI>Latin Boarding-Schools</HI>;
Mr. <HI>Stout</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Loyd</HI>'s Fami|lies;
<PB N="26" REF="29">
Mr. <HI>John Dim&s;dale</HI>'s Coachman and
his Wi&s;e; and Mr. <HI>Santoon</HI>'s Maid-Servant,
who was brought to the &s;ame Hou&s;e, and
died of the Confluent kind of the <HI>Small Pox</HI>;

I began this Practice: The&s;e are Mat|ters
of Fact, which the Doctor's Author can|not
di&s;prove. To charge then the Spreading
the <HI>Infection</HI> and the Con&s;equences of it,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> that Town, upon two &s;ingle Boys who
were <HI>Inoculated</HI> in a Court in a manner &s;e|parated
from all the re&s;t of the Town, which
was fuller of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before than after
the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> is not agreeable to that In|genuity
which the Doctor &s;eems to demand
of his Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>De Grave</HI>'s Daughter
which fills up three or four Pages in the Let|ter,
and upon which the Doctor lays the
Foundation of his <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> the Reader may
plea&s;e to take from her Father's own Words
in his Letter annex'd. From which it ap|pears
<PB N="27" REF="30">
that the Girl had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> but
once, of the favourable kind; and in all
Probability by <HI>Inoculation.</HI> So far the Ca&s;e
is &s;ingular, that it did not take place till ele|ven
Weeks after the Operation; and untill
the Blood was put into a Ferment by violent
Motion. Here the Doctor triumphs in his
<HI>Dilemma, Either &s;he had, or &s;he had not the</HI>
Small Pox <HI>by Inoculation</HI>; If the fir&s;t, then it
is plain <HI>Inoculation</HI> is no <HI>preventive</HI> of the
<HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI>; If the &s;econd, the <HI>Experiment</HI> is
good for nothing. I think in this way of Ar|gumentation,
to make it conclu&s;ive, there
ought to be a perfect <HI>Enumeration</HI>; but here
is a <HI>Third</HI> Ca&s;e, and the real one, not enu|merated;
which is, that the Girl had the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> and that but once, by <HI>Inocula|tion</HI>;
tho' not at the &s;ame Time when the
Doctor lays the Scene of his <HI>Dilemma.</HI> But
to con&s;ider the Second Branch; allowing
that this <HI>Small Pox</HI> was the natural Sort,
and not produc'd by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> of which,
I think, the contrary is plain; &s;ure it is a
&s;trange In&s;erence to &s;ay, that becau&s;e <HI>Inocu|lation</HI>
has not taken Effect in one Subject, it
is therefore good for nothing. The Do|ctor's
excellent Judgment will in&s;truct him
to rea&s;on with more Temper and Solidity in
other Matters of his Profe&s;&s;ion; and not
make U&s;e of his <HI>Aphori&s;m, That one In|&s;tance</HI>
is as good as a thou&s;and in Matters of
Experience. What the Doctor &s;ays of his
<PB N="28" REF="31">
Fears of a great Cla&s;s of Hypothetical Di|&s;ea&s;es,
is all vani&s;h'd, and the Girl is very
well. I refer the Doctor upon this Head
of the Preventive Power of <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
to the Letter which he lays &s;o much Stre&s;s
upon, from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; where his Ally in
this Di&s;pute owns, <HI>That not one of the</HI> Ino|culated
(being about three Hundred) <HI>during
the Space of five or &s;ix Months,</HI> in a general
Run of the <HI>Small Pox, has had the</HI> Small
Pox <HI>the natural Way, as far as we know:</HI>
But of this more afterwards.</P>
<P>As for his &s;econd Story of Captain <HI>Hu&s;|&s;art,</HI>
it requires only a bare Reading to make
it ridiculous; For no unprejudic'd Per&s;on of
common Sen&s;e can believe that one, after ha|ving
been <HI>Inoculated</HI> twice without any Ef|fect,
would try it a third Time: But after a
third Time, to try it a fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth
Time, pa&s;&s;eth all Degrees of Credibility. But
it &s;eems this Captain was not very certain,
whether it was five or &s;ix Times; one <HI>Inocu|lation</HI>
had quite &s;lipt out of his Memory: he
wanted one Quality, which the Proverb de|mands
in &s;ome Sort of People. Since the Doc|tor
can give Credit to this Story of Captain
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and at the &s;ame Time que&s;tion the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> what is &s;aid by eminent Phy&s;icians,

Ob&s;ervations on the Spot, where <HI>Inoculation</HI>
is practis'd daily; I appeal to my Readers, if
I may not with Ju&s;tice tax him of being par|tially
<PB N="29" REF="32">
<HI>Credulous</HI> or <HI>Incredulous,</HI> as Facts make
for or again&s;t his Purpo&s;e. And with all due
Re&s;pect to the Senate of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> I que&s;tion
whether a Bill, or an <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> founded up|on
&s;uch a Fact, is more extraordinary. But al|lowing
it to be true, what is the Inference?
That a Per&s;on, who could not catch the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> had them the natural
Way: If that were granted, will it prove, that
one who has the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
may afterwards have them the natural Way?
If upon the &s;ame Authority, the Doctor can
believe the Story of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Dragoon,
or the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Soldiers in the <HI>French</HI> Ar|my;
I wi&s;h him much Joy. I promi&s;e him
I will not (like the Gentry who went in que&s;t
of St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s Trough) ride twenty Miles to
be able to di&s;prove it. I &s;hould be glad to
know, which Way the Doctor &s;upports &s;o
bold an A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That</HI> [Page 17] <HI>by the Ac|count
Dr.</HI> Nettleton <HI>gives, as al&s;o by the be&s;t
Ob&s;ervation upon tho&s;e who have been</HI> Inocu|lated
<HI>in this City, &s;carcely a fourth Part of

I have read over carefully Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI>'s Ac|count,
contain'd in his Letters printed in the
<HI>Tran&s;actions</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> N^o 370;
and for my Life I cannot find any Thing to
ju&s;tify this A&s;&s;ertion; on the contrary he &s;ays,
<HI>We have not yet found, that ever any had the
Di&s;temper twice, neither is there any Rea&s;on
to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible; there being no Difference</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="33"><HI>that can be ob&s;erv'd betwixt the natural and

are commonly fewer in Number; and all
the re&s;t of the Symptoms are in the &s;ame Pro|portion
more favourable.</HI> I hope there is at
lea&s;t as much Credit due to an ingenious Pra|ctitioner,
who writes from a very extended
Experience, as to one who writes for the
mo&s;t Part by Hear&s;ay.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who have been <HI>Inoculated</HI> in
<HI>London</HI>; to oppo&s;e my own, and other Per|&s;ons
Te&s;timony from ocular In&s;pection, again&s;t
his, who talks by Report, may &s;eem perhaps
too great Pre&s;umption. I therefore challenge
the Doctor to name the Ca&s;es and Authori|ties
whereby he &s;upports &s;uch a wild A&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r</HI>'s Ca&s;e, I will not pre|occupy
my Reader with any Reflection; but
refer him to the Matter of Fact here &s;ubjoin'd,

<P>As to the Ca&s;e of Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ts</HI>'s Servant,
I refer to the Account &s;ubjoin'd.</P>
<P>He is ju&s;t as much mi&s;inform'd of the Ca&s;e
of Lord <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI>'s Son, who had a favourable
Sort of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and was in no Danger
of his Life; as the Phy&s;ician who attended
him will readily own.</P>
<P>As to the unfortunate Accidents which
have happen'd to &s;ome of the Fir&s;t Rank by
<PB N="31" REF="34">
this <HI>Ingrafting Method</HI>; if I gue&s;s right who
he means, one of them is perfectly well with|out
any unfortunate Accident; and the Im|po&s;thumation,
which had no Dependance nor
Communication with the Inci&s;ion, is per|fectly
cur'd without any Exfoliation of the
Bone, or any <HI>Hectic Fever.</HI> But it is hard to
charge the common Accidents of the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> in general, upon this Method in par|ticular.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s a Mi&s;information, that the
Children of a Nobleman, under&s;tood in his
Letter, were <HI>Ingrafted</HI> from a bad Sort of
<HI>Small Pox.</HI> As to what he &s;ays of the poorer
Sort of <HI>People of</HI> Scotland, <HI>running about
with the</HI> Small Pox <HI>upon them, without ei|ther
Shoes or Stockings</HI>; the Doctor &s;eems
here to intend a Reflection, but I choo&s;e to
avoid all Reflections, either National or Do|me&s;tick.
I believe the People of <HI>England,</HI> as
well as tho&s;e of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the mo&s;t Part,
neither wear <HI>Shoes</HI> nor <HI>Stockings</HI> in the <HI>Small

about,</HI> they are much in the &s;ame Con|dition,
as they are here; &s;ome have them fa|vourably,
&s;ome otherwi&s;e, and every one has
Conveniencies and Helps according to their
Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As for the three Letters from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in
<HI>New England,</HI> printed by Way of <HI>Appendix</HI>
to the Doctor's, It might &s;uffice to &s;ay, that
they are only a &s;evere, and perhaps a ju&s;t In|vective,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
again&s;t the Clergy and others, for
meddling in this Branch of the Phy&s;icians
Practice: Upon which Encroachment, &s;ome
of the Faculty invoke the Vengeance of the
Civil Magi&s;trate; and threaten the Offen|ders,
as <HI>Poi&s;oners</HI> and <HI>Spreaders of Infection,</HI>
with Pri&s;ons and Gibbet's: And if the Laws
in being are &s;omewhat deficient, mode&s;tly
call, as &s;ome others have done, upon the Le|gi&s;lature
for new Ones. This general Con&s;i|deration
is &s;ufficient to invalidate the Credit
of any Thing that is &s;aid by a Per&s;on &s;o &s;trong|ly
intere&s;ted: But &s;o great is the Force of
Truth, that it has extorted enough from this
partial Complainant to ju&s;tify the Practice,
which he &s;o bitterly inveighs again&s;t. For
fir&s;t he owns, that the whole Practice of <HI>Ino|culation</HI>
was manag'd by unskillful Per&s;ons;
and that many <HI>who dy'd or &s;uffer'd much un|der</HI>
Inoculation, <HI>if they had had better Ma|nagement,
might have had better Fate.</HI> That
the Practitioners neglected <HI>as trivial both the
Advantages of a &s;uitable Sea&s;on, and a well prepared
Body; That they</HI> Inoculated <HI>all A|ges
and Con&s;titutions from the Beginning;
That they</HI> Inoculated <HI>Women with Child, and
Hy&s;terical people:</HI> And after all, <HI>They pra|ctis'd
it at fir&s;t with indifferent good Succe&s;s:
That it had been practis'd, &s;ince the Middle
of</HI> June <HI>to the Date of his Letter,</HI> Dec. 20.
<HI>upon above two hundred Subjects with vari|ous
Succce&s;s.</HI> He tells you in his &s;econd Let|ter,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
<HI>That they had at that Time the Expe|rience
of two or three Hundred</HI> Inoculated:
And after all this, in all his three Letters, he
gives you only two Letters of the Name of
one <HI>Inoculated</HI> Per&s;on who dy'd, Mrs. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l.</HI>
He &s;ays at Random, <HI>that others dy'd of it,
whom Time may bring to Light.</HI> Were the
Bodies of tho&s;e <HI>Inoculated</HI> Per&s;ons hid under
Dunghills? Had they not Chri&s;tian Burial?
It is wondrous &s;trange, that in a Place, where
the Practitioners in Phy&s;ick and the Magi|&s;trates
both were again&s;t <HI>Inoculation,</HI> he could
not come at the Knowledge of a Mortal
Ca&s;e but one, the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Mrs. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l,</HI>
who is trump'd up upon all Occa&s;ions: He
&s;ays, <HI>many of the</HI> Inoculated <HI>&s;uffer much,</HI>
Page 2. What then? A Per&s;on that has the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> even in the gentle&s;t Sort, mu&s;t
&s;uffer, And at la&s;t, Page 10, he ingenuou&s;ly
acknowledges, <HI>That the</HI> Small Pox (acquir'd
by <HI>Inoculation</HI>) <HI>is frequently more favourable
than in the common Way, and not altogether
&s;o mortal.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That not one of the</HI> Inoculated
<HI>during the Space of five or &s;ix Months has
had the</HI> Small Pox <HI>in the natural Way, &s;o
far as we know</HI>; that is, of about three
hundred People <HI>Inoculated,</HI> &s;ome of which,
no doubt, had only tho&s;e Eruptions, which
they will not allow to be the genuine <HI>Small
Pox</HI>; In a Time, when the <HI>whole Town
and Country was an Ho&s;pital of People &s;ick</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="37"><HI>of the Di&s;temper, and few Per&s;ons exempt
from its Rage, for the Space of five or &s;ix
Months,</HI> not &s;o much as one had the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> for <HI>ought they knew:</HI> I &s;ay, if &s;uch a
Ca&s;e had happen'd, it is not probable it could
have been conceal'd; and that this Acknow|ledgment
from one, who is &s;o zealous an E|nemy
to the Practice, is a &s;tronger Proof of
the Efficacy of it, for the Purpo&s;e intended,
than all the <HI>Ifs</HI> and <HI>May-be's</HI> of this or any
other Letter-Writer.</P>
<P>It had been fair in this Gentleman to have
given in the Numbers that dy'd of the natu|ral
Sort of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> during that Sea&s;on;
or to have &s;tated the Ca&s;e fairly between two
or three Hundred &s;ick of the natural Sort, and
as many of the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Kind, both under
the Care and Direction of unskillful and un|experienc'd
People: And then, perhaps, as in
the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Kind, he could in&s;tance, by
Name, only One that dy'd; In the other Sort
he would have been puzzled to find the
Names of tho&s;e who e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>But to this he will &s;ay, that the <HI>Inocula|ted
Small Pox</HI> propagated the Mortality of
the natural Sort. There is a full An&s;wer gi|ven
to this Objection of &s;preading Infection
before. I think it is hard to exclude Men
from the Means of &s;ecuring them&s;elves from
a great Pe&s;tilence, upon a meer Sugge&s;tion:
The Influence of the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> up|on
Mankind, in any Place, in a Circle of
<PB N="35" REF="38">
Years, may be affirm'd to be uniform with
&s;trong Probability; and if the Air of any
Place, in a contagious <HI>Sea&s;on,</HI> is &s;uch, as ren|ders
the Di&s;temper very mortal, it is a &s;trong
Motive for People to take the Advantage of
a good Sea&s;on, and &s;ecure them&s;elves in
Time from a Plague, which is &s;o likely to de|&s;troy
them: And if Prudence only were to
be con&s;ulted, it would perhaps be much more
the Duty of the Legi&s;lature to order, than to
forbid this Practice. And no doubt, accord|ing
to the Acknowledgment of the Enemies
of this Practice, they would, by this Method,
dimini&s;h the Mortality, and encrea&s;e the
Number of their People; and the Magi&s;trate
is forc'd often upon more arbitrary Proceed|ings
in any Pe&s;tilence: But as that would
&s;eem too great an Encroachment upon the
natural Rights of Mankind, I &s;hould not ap|prove
of it. But on the other Hand, it would
be a mo&s;t Tyrannical Encroachment upon
the &s;ame Rights, to debar Mankind from the
lawful Means of &s;ecuring them&s;elves from
the Fear and Danger of &s;o terrible a Plague.</P>
<P>As for the particular <HI>Faetor,</HI> that, accord|ing
to the Letter, <HI>attends the Sores of the In|oculated</HI>;
it is much of a Piece with the
Story of the <HI>Kenti&s;h Long - Tayls:</HI> It &s;hews
him to be an utter Stranger to the whole
Practice; and makes one doubt, whether he
ever &s;aw a Ca&s;e of <HI>Inoculation</HI> quite through.
And the <HI>Pointing at the</HI> Inoculated <HI>in the</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="39">
<HI>Streets,</HI> is as great an In&s;tance of Barbarity,
as the other is of Ignorance.</P>
<P>There is a Letter in Town from the Revd.
Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> of a later Date, which
has &s;everal remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages in it. <HI>The
Di&s;temper</HI> (meaning the Small Pox) <HI>has late|ly
vi&s;ited and ran&s;acked the City of</HI> Bo&s;ton;
<HI>and in little more than half a Year, of about
five thou&s;and Per&s;ons, that have undergone
it, near nine hundred have died.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But how many Lives might have been
&s;av'd, if our unhappy Phy&s;icians had not poi|&s;on'd
and bewitch'd our People with a blind
Rage, that has appear'd, very like a Satanick
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the Method of Relief and
Safety in the way of the</HI> Small Pox <HI>Inocula|ted?
I prevail'd with one Phy&s;ician (and for
it, I have had bloody Attempts made upon
my Life by &s;ome of our Energumens) to in|troduce
the Practice; and the Experiment
has been made upon almo&s;t three hundred Sub|jects
in our Neighbourhood, young and old,
from one Year to &s;eventy; weak and &s;trong,
Male and Female, white and black; in Mid|&s;ummer,
in Autumn and Winter: And it &s;uc|ceeds
to Admiration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot learn that any one has died of it,
tho' the Experiment has been made under va|rious
and marvellous Di&s;advantages. Five
or &s;ix have died upon it or after it; but from
other Accidents.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40">
He mentions afterward <HI>that Cats had it</HI>;
<HI>and takes notice of the &s;ame thing in Doctor</HI>
Leigh's <HI>Hi&s;tory of</HI> Lanca&s;hire; <HI>and &s;ubjoins,</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>it was generally complain'd that Pi|geon-hou&s;es
of the City continu'd unfruitful;
and the Pigeons did not lay or hatch, as they
us'd to do, all the while that the</HI> Small Pox
<HI>was in its Epidemical Progre&s;s: And it is
very &s;trongly affirmed, that our Dunghill
Fowl felt much of the like upon them.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t concludes; <HI>with the great Benefit
they have found by Bli&s;ters early apply'd and
continu'd in the natural</HI> Small Pox, <HI>and is
&s;orry it was &s;o late before they fell into this
Way; but it has con&s;tantly pro&s;per'd: I
know not, &s;ays he, that it has once mi&s;car|ried
&s;ince we came into it.</HI> I refer the Rea|der
to his Letter annex'd.</P>
<P>It appears by this Letter, that &s;omewhat
more than one out of five, and le&s;s than one
out of &s;ix died of the Di&s;temper. And like|wi&s;e,
by the Effects mention'd upon Animals,
that the general Contagion was owing to a
bad Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air; and not char|geable
upon <HI>Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, notwith&s;tanding the unfavou|rable
Con&s;titution of the Air, the <HI>Inoculated</HI>
did well.</P>
<P>I doubt not but the impartial Reader is
now &s;atisfy'd that this Practice of <HI>Inocula|tion</HI>
may be &s;till beneficial to Mankind, not|with&s;tanding
any thing that the Doctor has
<PB N="38" REF="41">
adduc'd to the contrary, either by way of
Argument or Fact. And that by the &s;ame
zealous Partiality, it had been ea&s;y to have
cru&s;h'd any, the mo&s;t u&s;eful Practice in Me|dicine
in the Beginning. It is pretty remar|kable,
that in a Neighbouring Nation, where
Agues are the be&s;t Branch of the Phy&s;icians
Practice, the U&s;e of the Bark has been, and
is &s;till in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;s'd by Me|thods
not much unlike what are us'd again&s;t
<HI>Inoculation</HI>; and indeed every one of the
Doctor's Arguments would have concluded
more &s;trongly again&s;t the U&s;e of the <HI>Cortex,</HI>
than again&s;t this Practice. I will &s;uppo&s;e any
Stickler again&s;t the Bark to have rea&s;on'd
thus in the Doctor's Strain. <HI>A Drug that
has been only us'd among Slaves, an illiterate
unthinking People, who have the Advantage
of a warm Climate, and a Spare Dyet, is not
fit to be immediately di&s;pens'd to the</HI> Engli&s;h,
<HI>who&s;e Blood, &s;peaking of it as National, is
the Product of the Riche&s;t Dyet: Is it not
plain by the Di&s;ea&s;es that it often leaves be|hind
it, that it &s;poils the Con&s;titution? Wit|ne&s;s
the Jaundice, Tumours of the Legs, and
other Cachexies that are often &s;ub&s;equent up|on
it. Be&s;ides none but Empirics can give
a Medicine of which they are not &s;ure of the
Do&s;e; Is it not plain that it will not an&s;wer
the De&s;ign of preventing the Di&s;ea&s;e for the
future? For notwith&s;tanding the U&s;e of this
Drug, the Patient &s;uffers many a Relap&s;e. Be|&s;ides</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="42">
<HI>there are not only one or two, but innu|merable
In&s;tances of People who have died
after the U&s;e of it; and others, who have
had a di&s;ea&s;ed Con&s;titution all the re&s;t of their
Lives. The Di&s;pen&s;ers of this Medicine di&s;|agree
widely among them&s;elves, both as to
the Manner of its Operation and the Do&s;e;
Some give it in Tincture; &s;ome in Sub&s;tance;
&s;ome in greater, &s;ome in le&s;&s;er Quantities, &amp;c.
In fine, there are three Letters from a Friend
in</HI> New England, <HI>which inform me that ma|ny
who have taken the Bark have &s;uffer'd ve|ry
much; and Mrs.</HI> D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l, <HI>who had taken
great Quantities of it, actually died, &amp;c. Tho'
I have not my &s;elf made U&s;e of this Medicine,
nor &s;een much of the Effects of it; I am well
a&s;&s;ur'd, that not a fourth part of the Di&s;ea&s;es
it pretends to cure, are Genuine Agues: Be|fore
I had &s;een the Practice of this Medicine,
I affirmed, that is was impo&s;&s;ible, it would cure
an Ague; but I am willing to retract that
Opinion, being convinc'd by an Experiment,
that it does &s;o &s;ometimes.</HI> It were ea&s;y to
carry this Parallel rea&s;oning thro' the whole
Letter, not only with equal, but more
Strength in mo&s;t Places.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in appearing with &s;o great
Zeal again&s;t this Practice, is not the Repre|&s;entative
of the whole Faculty. For there
are many of them who from their Di&s;inte|re&s;tedne&s;s
and Innate Love to Mankind, are
willing, that an Experiment &s;hould go on,
<PB N="40" REF="43">
which, in Proportion to the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of
the Practice, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h the
Mortality of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in general: This
is a candid, as well as decent Way of proceed|ing.
At the &s;ame Time, I only blame the
Author of the Letter, and tho&s;e who take
part with him, for their too early and &s;trong
Prejudices; being unwilling to Cen&s;ure
their Intentions, which I hope, are for the
Good of Mankind, as well as my own.</P>
<P>But there is &s;till a &s;tronger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey's Sermon,</HI> Page 6.</NOTE> Objection a|gain&s;t
this Practice; <HI>That it is unlawful, and
fir&s;t introduc'd by the Devil, who Ingrafted</HI>
Job <HI>of the Confluent Sort of</HI> Small Pox.</P>
<P>From u&s;eful Di&s;coveries, there can always
be drawn important Con&s;equences. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
Hence learn we, that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is an
ancient Di&s;ea&s;e; for if it was convey'd to
Job <HI>by &s;ome &s;uch Way as</HI> Inoculation, the
Matter mu&s;t have been taken from &s;ome Bo|dy
Infected with the Di&s;temper. <HI>Secondly,</HI>
That <HI>Sydenham</HI> was not the fir&s;t that began
the <HI>cool Regimen</HI>; for <HI>Job</HI> fat down upon
the A&s;hes in the open Air; <HI>his Friends &s;aw
him afar off. Thirdly,</HI> That his Friends were
tardy, above three Weeks before they came
to &s;ee him; for in the Genuine Confluent
Kind of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> it will be that Time
before they can bear &s;craping with a Pot|&s;herd.
<PB N="41" REF="44">
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> Beloved, this confluent Sort
of <HI>Small Pox</HI> were more gentle, to be &s;ure,
than the common natural Ones; for he &s;eems
neither to have had Delirium, &s;ore Throat,
nor Shortne&s;s of Breath; he talk'd di&s;tinctly
and good Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Now here a Que&s;tion ari&s;eth, Whether an
hone&s;t Man can do that which the Devil has
done? I an&s;wer in the Affirmative; there are
three things mention'd; of the Devil's A&s;&s;em|bling
him&s;elf (as in this Place) with the Sons
of God; Believing, and Quoting of Scripture.
All the&s;e Things a good Man may not only
do, but is bound to do.</P>
<P>I readily agree with this Reverend Divine,
that if <HI>Inoculating</HI> the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be an un|lawful
Action, it cannot be ju&s;tify'd by the
Good which may en&s;ue from it; but that
it is unlawful, mu&s;t be prov'd, either by &s;ome
natural or po&s;itive Law: That this Reverend
Gentleman has brought no &s;uch Proof, either
from natural or reveal'd Religion, will ap|pear
plain upon a very &s;hort Review of his
Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Page 13.] He &s;ays he will attempt to prove,
<HI>That Di&s;ea&s;es are utterly unlawful to be infli|cted
by any who profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians:</HI>
He terms it very right; for it is an Attempt
to Prove, and no more. By re&s;training the
Prohibition to Chri&s;tians, one would think,
there was &s;ome po&s;itive Command in the Go|&s;pel
again&s;t it; but he has brought none, which,
<PB N="42" REF="45">
by the mo&s;t forc'd Con&s;truction, can prove
<HI>Inoculation</HI> to be prohibited by the Chri&s;tian
Di&s;pen&s;ation. I know of no Immorality that
is forbid to a Chri&s;tian, the Practice of which
is allow'd to an Infidel. Indeed Morality is
more clearly taught and more &s;trongly en|forc'd
by Rewards and Puni&s;hments among&s;t
us; but it does not change its Nature among&s;t
the re&s;t of Mankind. He does not wonder,
that the Practice of <HI>Inoculation</HI> &s;hould obtain,
where the Doctrine of <HI>Fatality</HI> is believ'd; but
the Misfortune is, that the Matter of Fact is
quite otherwi&s;e: For if he had carefully pe|rus'd
Dr. <HI>Wag&s;taffe</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, which he &s;o
much commends, that would have inform'd
him, <HI>That no Body pretends to give us an In|&s;tance
of an</HI> Inoculated Turk. And why? Be|cau&s;e
their Belief of a Fatality makes them
neglect very much the ordinary Helps of Me|dicine
for pre&s;erving their Lives.</P>
<P>Page 14.] The In&s;tances which he gives
of Almighty God's having given a miracu|lous
Power to Mankind to inflict Di&s;ea&s;es
for their Puni&s;hment, does not prove, that
He has not given them an ordinary one for
their Benefit.</P>
<P>And his &s;aying, [Pag.15] <HI>That no Man was
ever yet condemn'd to an immediate Sickne&s;s,
for Want of &s;ufficient Authority</HI>; is, without
any Proof. Di&s;ea&s;es are External, and In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">;
the Magi&s;trate very often inflicts both:
That Criminals are lawfully puni&s;h'd with the
<PB N="43" REF="46">
Mutilation of their Body, I &s;uppo&s;e he will
allow to be common. Is not that inflicting
a Di&s;ea&s;e with a Witne&s;s? And are there not
many Executions perform'd by Poi&s;on, which
is inflicting an Internal mortal Di&s;ea&s;e? And
here his own Argument turns upon him; for
<HI>if Di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ent for the Puni&s;hment of
our Sins,</HI> then it would &s;eem to follow, that
the Magi&s;trate, who has a Power from God to
puni&s;h our Crimes, has likewi&s;e a Power to
inflict Di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>for Sins that are manife&s;t to
him and all the World.</HI> The greater Power
of inflicting Death, certainly includes the le&s;|&s;er
in the Choice of the Means: If, for Ex|ample,
there &s;hould be a Law made to pu|ni&s;h
the <HI>Inoculators</HI> with the <HI>Inoculation</HI> of
&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, I fancy this Reverend Divine
would not think it &s;inful or unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Page 16.] He &s;pends a long Paragraph, to
prove what no Body ever deny'd; That a
Man cannot lawfully do all that is in his Po|wer
to do: And another as evident, That the
Means, as well as the Intention, mu&s;t be law|ful;
but the&s;e are only general Propo&s;itions;
The Sub&s;umption, that inflicting Di&s;ea&s;es for
a good Purpo&s;e is unlawful, is only &s;uppos'd,
not prov'd.</P>
<P>Page 18.] He <HI>doubts whether the Life of
Man be a Good or not.</HI> If the Life of Man is
no Good, then, indeed, to act for the Pre|&s;ervation
of it, is not to act for any good
End; and con&s;equently, not only this Pra|ctice,
<PB N="44" REF="47">
but all others in Medicine, and many
other charitable Actions, mu&s;t be given up.
The re&s;t of the Argument of this Paragraph,
is grounded upon the In&s;ufficiency of this
Method for the Purpo&s;e intended. The Do|ctor
might have remember'd, from his Ex|po&s;ition
of his Text, <HI>Job</HI> had the <HI>Small Pox</HI>
by <HI>Inoculation</HI> from the Devil, even of a fa|vourable
Sort; that he recover'd of them,
and never had them again. But in this he mu&s;t
forgive me, if I put him in Mind, that he is
out of his Sphere; and that notwith&s;tanding
his Profe&s;&s;ions to the contrary, he lays a&s;ide
the Divine, and takes upon him the Phy&s;i|cian.
The Que&s;tion here is, Whether giving
a Di&s;ea&s;e with a good Intention, be in it &s;elf
an unlawful Action.</P>
<P>Page 20.] Another Argument is, <HI>That a
Law which forbids the Evil, forbids al&s;o e|very
thing that has a Tendency to it; therefore
all cau&s;ele&s;s and voluntary Mutilations are for|bid:</HI>
And yet, notwith&s;tanding this Law again&s;t
Mutilation, more expre&s;s than any again&s;t <HI>I|noculation,</HI>
Surgeons cut off Peoples Limbs.
Here the Intention hallows the Action, which
is in it&s;elf expre&s;ly forbid; and which is more,
I believe no Surgeon will affirm, that in all
Ca&s;es, where Limbs are cut off, there is a
direct Impo&s;&s;ibility to &s;ave the Patient's Life
otherwi&s;e; or that the Operation is always
&s;ucce&s;sful. A Surgeon who cuts a Per&s;on for
the <HI>Stone,</HI> even if his Patient dies of the O|peration,
<PB N="45" REF="48">
does not think he has committed
a mortal Sin, in inflicting a mortal Di&s;ea&s;e;
and yet the Patient perhaps might have liv'd
many Years, and not dy'd of the Di&s;temper at
la&s;t. The Difference of the two Ca&s;es, the
one being for Cure, the other for Prevention,
does not change the State of the Que&s;tion;
which, in general Terms, is this, Whether
Mankind have a Lawful Power of inflicting
Di&s;ea&s;es for good Purpo&s;es? A Per&s;on who
has not had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> may be very
ju&s;tly con&s;ider'd, as having the Seeds of a
mortal Di&s;temper within him; and the Dread
of it is &s;urely a Suffering, that will ju&s;tify the
Lawfulne&s;s of u&s;ing Means, which have the
greate&s;t Probability of &s;aving him from a
Danger, which, for ought he knows, may
be nearer and greater, than that of a Stone
in the Bladder. Anxiety and Bodily Pain,
don't differ &s;o much, as to make an Action
lawful in one Ca&s;e, &s;inful in the other.</P>
<P>Page 21.] But it &s;eems <HI>it is a Tempting of
Providence.</HI> And there is no great Diffe|rence
between the <HI>Devil's Propo&s;al to our
Saviour, to ca&s;t him&s;elf down headlong, and
that of</HI> Inoculation. It is wonderful, into
what Ab&s;urdities, Zeal for an Opinion, will
drive a Man, even to a&s;&s;ert that there is no
Difference between a Man's running into a
Danger ab&s;olutely unnece&s;&s;ary, and from
which nothing but a direct Miracle can &s;ave
him; and a Venturing on a &s;mall Hazard to
<PB N="46" REF="49">
avoid a much greater. The Ca&s;e put it as
di&s;advantagiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, more re&s;em|bles
that of a Per&s;on who leaps out of a Win|dow
for fear of Fire, and &s;urely that can ne|ver
be reckon'd a Mi&s;tru&s;t of Providence,
even if he did it before he was much in Dan|ger;
for no body can &s;ay that God Almighty
may not &s;ave a Man from Fire in the ordi|nary
Cour&s;e of his Providence; And if a Per|&s;on,
who being prompted by his too early
Fears had taken this Cour&s;e, and lo&s;t his Life
by the Fall; no body will arraign him of
<HI>Self-murder:</HI> He might have done an impru|dent,
but not a &s;inful Action. The Parents
who &s;uffer their Children to conver&s;e with
their infected Relations; which differs in no
Moral Point from the Ca&s;e of <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
would think it very hard to be treated as Ho|micides
or Murderers of their Children, when
the very Action proceeds from, the contrary
Principle, extreme Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Pag. 22.] In the former Page, it was a pre|&s;umptuous
Tru&s;t; in this, it is an intire Mi&s;|tru&s;t
of Providence. He is &s;ure to have the
<HI>Inoculators</HI> &s;ome way or other.</P>
<P>Pag. 23.] They cannot pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing
upon their Endeavours; becau&s;e Prayer &s;up|po&s;es
the U&s;e of lawful Means.</P>
<P>I believe the contrary is true, for as a
Per&s;on, who is <HI>Inoculated,</HI> puts him&s;elf more
immediately into the Hands of God, if he
has any Sen&s;e of Religion, cannot avoid
<PB N="47" REF="50">
praying for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon the Means, which,
to be &s;ure, he thinks lawful, and has not yet
been prov'd to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Page 24.] His Argument to prove that
<HI>Inoculation</HI> tends to promote Vice and Im|mortality
is the mo&s;t extraordinary of all.
This it does, by taking off the Dread of
the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and con&s;equently the Re|&s;traints
of Sobriety that Mankind lie under
upon that Account. This Reverend Gentle|man
has very ju&s;tly found fault with one Ma|xim,
to <HI>do Evil that Good may come of it:</HI>
But he has e&s;tabli&s;h'd one, ju&s;t as dangerous
in the room of it, <HI>not to do Good lea&s;t Evil
come of it.</HI> For if the Dimini&s;hing the Fear
of Dying of Di&s;ea&s;es catch'd by Irregularity,
is an Evil, then an able Phy&s;ician is a com|mon
Nui&s;ance. We have rea&s;on to be thank|ful,
that there are a &s;ufficient Number left,
who cannot be charg'd with being Encoura|gers
of Vice and Immorality, upon this Score.
This Principle in its full Extent would de|&s;troy
all Works of Charity and Mercy; for
the Hope of Forgivene&s;s is an Encouragment
to do Injuries; and the Hope of being re|liev'd
in Want is a Di&s;couragement to In|du&s;try.</P>
<P>I am touch'd with the devout Reflections
upon Providence, that are all along &s;pread
thro' his Sermon, to which I &s;ub&s;cribe with
all my Heart; but I cannot &s;o much com|mend
the Di&s;torting tho&s;e great and &s;olemn
<PB N="48" REF="51">
Truths of our Holy Religion to mantain lit|tle
Party Intere&s;ts and fa&s;hionable Opinions.
The Text that is quoted Pag. 22. that the ve|ry
Hairs of our Head are numbred; I take to
be a &s;tronger Argument again&s;t Periwigs and
Shaving; than all that the Sermon contains
again&s;t <HI>Inoculation:</HI> Our Hairs of our Beards
were given us for an Ornament by Provi|dence,
and it is known, that many have
catch'd great Colds with mortal Di&s;Ea&s;es en|&s;uing
upon them by Shaving. Is not a Man
an&s;werable for all the bad Effects that fol|low
upon an unwarrantable Action that con|tradicts
the very Intention of Providence?</P>
<P>The Peroration Page 29, is equal to any
Piece of the whole Performance, <HI>Let the A|thei&s;t and the Scoffer, the Heathen and the
Unbeliever di&s;claim a Dependance upon Pro|vidence:
Let them</HI> Inoculate <HI>and be</HI> Inocu|lated,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> I think this clinches the whole
Matter; and this Reverend Gentleman has
furni&s;h'd us with a new, &s;en&s;ible and religious
Te&s;t, an Athei&s;t or Infidel can be found out,
as a Witch, by the Marks upon his Body: And
that, as it has been intimated already, that the
Devil was the fir&s;t <HI>Inoculator</HI>; I think, it is
not impo&s;&s;ible that the next zealous Preacher
upon this Subject may prove the Cicatrices
of <HI>Inoculation</HI> to be the Mark of the Bea&s;t.
Thus it appears, that the Doctors Po&s;ition, of
the Unlawfulne&s;s of inflicting Di&s;ea&s;es for
good Purpo&s;es, is groundle&s;s, and contrary
to the common U&s;ages of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
I have been oblig'd to be the more parti|cular
in an&s;wering this <HI>Sermon,</HI> becau&s;e the
Charge in it again&s;t the <HI>Inoculators,</HI> is hea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">
than that in the Letter, in as much as
immorality is a greater Fault than bad Pra|ctice
in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>From all that I have &s;aid, I will draw this
one Conclu&s;ion; that there does not appear
as yet any Objection of Weight enough to
&s;top the Progre&s;s of the Practice of <HI>Inocula|tion.</HI>
But if upon future Trials, it &s;hould
be found that the Inconveniencies do over|ballance
the Advantages of it; I &s;hall then
be as ready to condemn, as I am now to

<HEAD>The CASE of Mr. DEGRAVE'S
Daughter, in a LETTER to Mr.
MAITLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find my Daughter's Ca&s;e has made &s;ome
Noi&s;e in Town; and has been mi&s;repre|&s;ented.
It was thus: She was <HI>Inoculated</HI> the
23d of <HI>Febr.</HI> 1721-2; and as I &s;aw her daily
during the three Weeks that &s;he was con|fin'd
after the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> &s;o I can affirm, no
<HI>Small Pox</HI> ever appear'd uponher during that
Time, but only Heats and Flu&s;hings, attend|ed
&s;ometimes with Heavine&s;s and Pain in her
Head, and a little more Quickne&s;s of Pul&s;e
than u&s;ual, and oftentimes without any Di&s;|order
at all: None of tho&s;e Heats and Flu&s;h|ings
ever came to Perfection, or to any thing
like the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> which gave my Daugh|ter
&s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s; and the rather, that the
other Per&s;ons, who had been <HI>Inoculated</HI> at
the &s;ame Time, and in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with
her, had a very fair di&s;tinct <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and
yet had le&s;s Sickne&s;s than She: Nor did
the Inci&s;ions in her Arms di&s;charge &s;o much
and &s;o long as theirs did; and therefore were
compleatly heal'd in le&s;s than three Weeks
<PB N="52" REF="55">
Time, when the Sores of the other Per&s;on,
were yet large and running. Thus all Expe|ctation
of her having the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by the
<HI>Inoculation</HI> being over, &s;he was purg'd once
or twice, and then di&s;charg'd from her Con|finement,
the 17th of <HI>March</HI> following:
Nay, it was believ'd, &s;he never would have
that Di&s;temper; for having been very much
expos'd to the Infection, when the was but
two Years of Age, and yet more when the
was about Eight, without contracting it, this
la&s;t Tryal being un&s;ucce&s;sful, &s;eem'd to give
a tolerable Ground for this Opinion. How|ever
my Daughter continu'd di&s;compos'd, and
out of Order, when the came Home; the
Heats and Flu&s;hings abovemention'd
&s;till &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
on her, though in a le&s;&s;er Degree; her
Stomach loathing Fle&s;h-meats, and her Re&s;t
di&s;turb'd with Dreams and Horrors. She had
likewi&s;e two &s;mall Boils, one under her Arm,
and another on her Side: But none of the&s;e
Accidents were trouble&s;ome enough to hin|der
her Attendance on her accu&s;tom'd Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
within and without the Hou&s;e: How|ever
the&s;e continuing for about two Months
after &s;he came Home, the was purg'd once or
twice, in order to remove them; but &s;till they
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon her, not to any Degree, 'till
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> broke out upon her, which
happen'd in this Manner: Three Days be|fore,
&s;he had heated her&s;elf extraordinarily;
the fir&s;t, by going to the <HI>Camp</HI> and back a|gain,
<PB N="53" REF="56">
on Foot, in a very warm Day; the &s;e|cond,
by walking heartily to the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI>
to &s;ee her Brother and returning
Home; and the third Day in going and &s;it|ting
at the <HI>Play-Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</HI>
As &s;he &s;at at this la&s;t Place, the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> broke out upon her: at lea&s;t, I never per|ceiv'd
it upon her, 'till her Return; at which
my Daughter was &s;urpriz'd, &s;he having had no
Illne&s;s whatever, that could hinder her Plea|&s;ure
at the Play, and her walking Home;
or any &s;uch precur&s;ory Warnings of that Di|&s;temper,
which I hear have been divulg'd A|broad.
As &s;oon as the <HI>Small Pox</HI> had ap|pear'd,
&s;he recover'd her Stomach for tho&s;e
Fle&s;h-meats &s;he had loath'd before; and came
to that natural compos'd Sleep, of which &s;he
had been depriv'd &s;ince the <HI>Inoculation</HI>; And
&s;he having gone through the mo&s;t favourable
Periods of that Di&s;temper, &s;he got well in
Eight Days from That I perceiv'd the fir&s;t
Eruption; &s;o that I mu&s;t conclude, from the
Symptoms which my Daughter was by Times
afflicted with, during Eleven Weeks after
&s;he had been <HI>Inoculated,</HI> that it appears evi|dent
to me, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> &s;he had then, was
the Effect of the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> although it has
&s;hew'd it&s;elf much later than is u&s;ual, after
that Operation. As to the <HI>Itch,</HI> that appear'd
upon her about the &s;ame Time with the
<HI>Small Pox:</HI> I can only account for it thus;
She had been Infected by her Brother, about
<PB N="54" REF="57">
three Months before &s;he was <HI>Inoculated,</HI> and
I thonght her cur'd of it by the &s;ame Means
that were Efficacious for the Cure of her
Brother. It is certain that when &s;he was, there
was no Appearance &s;ub&s;i&s;ting of that Di&s;tem|per,
nor any Shew of it, 'till that Time the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> appear'd upon her. However, &s;he
is perfectly cur'd of the <HI>Itch,</HI> by the &s;ame
Means that were us'd at fir&s;t: And I thank
God, my Daughter is at pre&s;ent as well, if
not better, in every Re&s;pect, than ever &s;he
was in her Life.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN An&s;wer to what you require from me,
as to what has been farther done, I have
only to add, that &s;ince I writ to Dr. <HI>Whita|ker,</HI>
I have made the <HI>In&s;ition</HI> upon about fif|teen
Per&s;ons, who have all had the Di&s;tem|per
very favourably, and got thro' it with a
<PB N="55" REF="58">
great deal of Ea&s;e. As nothing uncommon
or extraordinary did happen in any of the&s;e
Ca&s;es, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to trouble you
with a particular Account of any of them:
They were mo&s;t of them at &s;ome Di&s;tance;
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> being, in a great Mea&s;ure,
gone from this Town and Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible of the Favour done me
by the Royal Society, who were plea&s;ed to
take Notice of my Letter to Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI>
which you had nothing to move you to, be|&s;ides
a generous Di&s;po&s;ition to encourage the
&s;malle&s;t Attempts towards any thing, that
may tend to publick Advantage. I mu&s;t own
that all the Information I had concerning this
Affair, which I have happen'd to be engaged
in was entirely from the <HI>Philo&s;ophical
Tran&s;actions.</HI> 'Tis now about &s;ix Years &s;ince
the Royal Society did communicate to the
World &s;ome Letters from two very con&s;ide|rable
Phy&s;icians re&s;iding in <HI>Turky,</HI> who&s;e
good Sen&s;e or Integrity we had no rea&s;on to
call in que&s;tion; the&s;e Gentlemen did &s;o|lemnly
a&s;&s;ure us, that the Method of <HI>Inocu|lation</HI>
had been for many Years practis'd in
tho&s;e Parts of the World, with almo&s;t con|&s;tant
Succe&s;s. I had, as well as all others
who have been engaged in, the Practice, with
&s;ufficient Sorrow and Concern, been called
to many in the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> who&s;e Ca&s;es were
&s;o deplorable, as to admit of no Relief. And
therefore I could not but be very thoughtful
<PB N="56" REF="59">
about this Method, which promi&s;ed to carry
Per&s;ons thro' that cruel Di&s;temper, with &s;o
much Ea&s;e and Safety. I was &s;o far from
knowing that it was a Crime, that I always
thought it the Duty of our Profe&s;&s;ion, to do
what we could to pre&s;erve the Lives of tho&s;e
who commit them&s;elves to our Care. And
I know no Rea&s;on, why we ought not, with
all humble Thankfulne&s;s to Almighty God,
to make U&s;e of any Means, which his good
Providence &s;hall bring to Light conducing to
that End. This Matter, tho' of &s;o great Im|portance,
lying dormant &s;o long after it was
known, is, I pre&s;ume a &s;ufficient Proof, that
none have been very forward to try Expe|riments.
But when we had the Account in the
publick Papers, that it had by their <HI>Royal-Highne&s;s</HI>'s
Command been done with Suc|ce&s;s
at <HI>London,</HI> I could not be &s;atisfy'd with|out
trying it here. I was &s;oon convinced,
that it would be of very great U&s;e; and the
more Experience I have had of it &s;ince, the
more I am confirm'd in the &s;ame Opinion. I
believe all others, who have &s;een any thing of
this Practice, are in the &s;ame Sentiment, and
there is no doubt, but in a few Years the
World will acknowledge the Service, which
the Royal Society have done to Mankind, in
fir&s;t revealing to this Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> a Thing
&s;o beneficial as it will certainly prove; for
tho' &s;ome few unfortunate Accidents may
&s;ometimes happen, yet the&s;e will be very rare
<PB N="57" REF="60">
in compari&s;on of the many &s;ad and di&s;a&s;trous
Events, which this Di&s;temper has been, and
ever will be very fruitful of, while it is left
to rage in its full Force and Violence.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I doubt not but when you Love col|lected
a &s;ufficient number of Ob&s;ervations for
it, you will be able to demon&s;trate, that the
Hazard in this Method is very incon&s;iderable,
in proportion to that in the ordinary way by
accidental Contagion, &s;o &s;mall, that it ought
not to deter any body from making u&s;e of it.
In order to &s;atisfy my &s;elf, what Proportion
the Number of tho&s;e that die of the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> might bear to the whole Number that
is &s;eized with the Di&s;temper; in the Natural
way, I have made &s;ome Enquiry hereabouts,
and I &s;hall take the Freedom to tran&s;mit the
Accounts to you, becau&s;e I believe you may
depend upon their being taken with &s;ufficient
Care and Impartiality. In <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;ince the
Beginning of la&s;t Winter, 276 have had the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> and out of that Number 43 have
died. In <HI>Rochdale,</HI> a &s;mall Neighbouring
Market Town, 177 have had the Di&s;temper,
and 38 have died. In <HI>Leeds,</HI> 792 have had
the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and 189 have died. It is
to be noted, that in this Town, the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> have been more favourable this Sea&s;on
than u&s;ual, and in <HI>Leeds</HI> they have been more
than u&s;ually mortal; but upon a <HI>Medium</HI> in
the&s;e three Towns, there have died nearly 22
out of every hundred, which is above a <HI>fifth</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="61"> <HI>Part,</HI> of all that have been infected in the na|tural
way. I have in the&s;e Accounts con|fin'd
my &s;elf to the Limits of the Towns.
The Numbers that have had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in
the Country round about, is va&s;tly greater;
but the Proportion of tho&s;e that die is much
the &s;ame. I have made the Enquiry in &s;eve|ral
Country Villages hereabouts, in &s;ome I
found the Proportion to be greater, in others
le&s;s, but in the main it is nearly the &s;ame.</P>

in <HI>New England</HI></HEAD>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SO con&s;iderable a Part of Mankind fear|fully
peri&s;hing by the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; and
many more of us grievou&s;ly &s;uffering by
that mi&s;erable Di&s;temper, you will allow me
to entertain you with a few more Commu|nications,
and writ (I think it's) a fourth
Letter upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">
The <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> has lately vi&s;ited and ran|&s;ack'd
the City of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and in little more
than half a Year, of more then five thou&s;and
Per&s;ons that have undergone it, near nine
hundred have died. But how many Lives
might have been &s;aved, if our unhappy <HI>Phy|&s;icians,</HI>
had not <HI>poi&s;on'd and bewitch'd</HI> our
People with a <HI>blind Rage,</HI> that has appear'd
very like a <HI>Satanick Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> again&s;t the
Method of Relief and Safety in the way of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Inoculated.</P>
<P>I prevail'd with one Phy&s;ician, (and for it
I have had bloody Attempts made upon <HI>my
Life</HI> by &s;ome of our <HI>Energumens</HI>) to intro|duce
the Practice; and the Experiment has
been made upon almo&s;t three hundred Ob|jects
in our Neighbourhoud, Young and Old;
(from one Year to &s;eventy) weak and &s;trong;
Male and Female, White and Black; in Mid|&s;ummer,
in Autumn, in Winter, and it &s;uc|ceeds
to Admiration.</P>
<P>I cannot learn that any one has died of it;
tho' the Experiment has been made under va|rious
and marvellous Di&s;advantages. Five or
&s;ix have died upon it, or after it, but from o|ther
Di&s;ea&s;es or Accidents; chiefly from hav|ing
taken the Infection in the common way,
by In&s;piration, before it could be given them
in this way of <HI>Tran&s;plantation.</HI> However at
pre&s;ent I need &s;ay no more of this, having al|ready
given you &s;ome Report of our Proceed|ings
in it.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">
To them who are under the <HI>Inoculation</HI> of
the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> we commonly give a <HI>Vomit,</HI>
in the time of their <HI>Decumbiture,</HI> a Day or
two before the expected Eruption. One of
our Patients not vomiting &s;o freely as he
would have done, thru&s;t a Finger or two into
his Throat, which fetch'd up, what was to be
di&s;charg'd from his unea&s;y Stomach; He had
but a few of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and the Pu&s;tules
were &s;ufficiently of the <HI>di&s;tinct Sort,</HI> as it
u&s;es to be where they have the <HI>Small Pox In|oculated</HI>;
but the Fingers that had been thus
employ'd, prov'd as full as they could hold, of
the <HI>confluet Sort,</HI> which he now thought his
whole Body would have been, if we had not
in this Way prevented it.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Leigh</HI> in his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> of
<HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> counts it an Occurrence worth
relating, that there were &s;ome Catts known
to catch the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; and pa&s;s regularly
thro' the State of it, and then to die. We
have had among us the very &s;ame Occur|rence.</P>
<P>It was generally ob&s;erv'd and complain'd,
that the Pigeon-<HI>Hou&s;es</HI> of the City continu'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and the <HI>Pigeons</HI> did not <HI>hatch</HI> or
<HI>lay</HI> as they u&s;ed to do, all the while that the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> was in its Epidemical Progre&s;s:
And it is very &s;trongly affirm'd that our
Dunghil Fowl felt much of the like Effect
upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">
We have &s;o many among us, who have
been vi&s;ited with the <HI>Plague</HI> in other Coun|tries
many Years ago, and who have never
been arre&s;ted with the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after it, tho'
they have been expo&s;ed as much as any other
People to it; that it now begins to obtain a
Belief with us, that they who have had the
<HI>Plague,</HI> will never have the <HI>Small Pox</HI> af|ter
it.</P>
<P>I will add but one Thing more. For Suc|cour
under the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> where Life is in
Danger, after all the Methods and Medicines,
that our <HI>Sydenham</HI> and others rely upon; I
can a&s;&s;ure you, we have yet found nothing &s;o
&s;ure as this; Procure for the Patient, as early as
may be, by <HI>Epi&s;pa&s;tiks</HI> a plentiful Di&s;charge
at the <HI>Hand-writs,</HI> or Ancles, or both, (I &s;ay
as early as my be) and keep them running
till the Danger is over. When the Venom
of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> makes an evident or vio|lent
Inva&s;ion on the Nobler Parts this Di&s;|charge
<HI>does wonderfully.</HI> I am &s;orry it was
&s;o late before we fell into this Way; but it
has <HI>con&s;tantly pro&s;per'd:</HI> I know not that it
has once mi&s;carried, &s;ince we came into it.</P>

<P>MY Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;t's</HI> Six Children were
<HI>Inoculated</HI> the 18<HI>th April:</HI> Five of
them had got thro' the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before the
30<HI>th,</HI> when his Servant was <HI>Inoculated.</HI> He
came from <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> to My Lord's Hou&s;e in
<HI>London</HI> about the Time that his Children had
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> on them, with an Intent to be
Inoculated; but Matter could not be found &s;o
&s;oon as de&s;ired, and the Fellow in the mean
time liv'd among the Servants that attended
on My Lord's Children: Whether he had
contracted any Infection by that Commerce
is not determin'd; or whether the Di&s;order
he had on him three or four Days before he
was Inoculated, may be a&s;cribed to that, as
&s;ome have thought, or to a Change of Dyet
and Air, or only to a Cold caught; 'tis mo&s;t
certain he complain'd then of Pain in his
Head and Bones; and was feveri&s;h. Doctor
<HI>Mead</HI> was con&s;ulted, and order'd him to be
blooded, vomited, and other Medicines for
his Relief; and that the Inoculation &s;hould
be Po&s;tpon'd till after his Recovery: For this
End he was remov'd out of My Lord's Hou&s;e
to a Nur&s;e, who takes People in for the <HI>Small
Pox.</HI> He got well of his Complaints the 28<HI>th
April</HI>; and 'twas thought proper to Inocu|late
him the 30<HI>th Ditto.</HI> He kept well till the
<PB N="63" REF="66">
<HI>5th May,</HI> and then had no other Di&s;order on
him than what is u&s;ual before the Eruption of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after Inoculation. On the 6<HI>th</HI>
the Eruptions were plain of the di&s;tinct large
Kind, and he was relieved on that Account;
but at Night his Complaints returned on him,
and were rather more &s;evere than they had
been, he having then a kind of <HI>Dilirium,</HI> fre|quent
Vomitings and Stools; The&s;e conti|nuing
the 7<HI>th,</HI> Doctor <HI>Arbothnot</HI> was call'd
to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> &s;aw him al&s;o
the next Day. They pre&s;crib'd &s;everal things,
which had the de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s; but at this
Time his Body was cover'd with <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
and mo&s;t of it of the confluent Sort. He
continu'd in a tolerable good Way till the
11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> when his Fever was &s;harper on
him, with a <HI>Dilirium</HI> and Difficulty of
Breathing. He was then blooded and bli&s;terd,
but without any Effect. He died the 12<HI>th,</HI>
and was open'd the 13<HI>th.</HI> Then upon In&s;pe|cting
the Out&s;ide of his Body, the Face and
Limbs were found as full of <HI>Small Pox</HI> as
they could hold; as were al&s;o two Places in
his Brea&s;t and Shoulders; they all appearing
of the Confluent Sort. Nothing Material
was ob&s;erv'd in the Di&s;&s;ection of his Body,
&s;aving that the Lungs were Inflamed and mor|tified;
and that in the Cavities of the Thorax
there was a pretty large Quantity of bloody
Matter extrava&s;ated.</P>
