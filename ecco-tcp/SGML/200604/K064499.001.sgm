<P>MY LORD,</P>
<P>WHEN five years ago an important &s;tation in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge awaited your Lord&s;hip's di&s;po&s;al, you were plea&s;ed to offer it to me. The circum&s;tances, under which this offer was made, demand a public acknow|ledgement. I had never &s;een your Lord&s;hip: I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no connection which could po&s;&s;ibly recommend me to your favour: I was known to you, only by my endeavours, in common with
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
many others, to di&s;charge my duty as a tutor in the Univer&s;ity; and by &s;ome very imperfect, but certainly well in|tended, and, as you thought, u&s;eful pub|lications &s;ince. In an age by no means wanting in examples o&s; honourable pa|tronage, although this de&s;erve not to be mentioned, in re&s;pect of the object of your Lord&s;hip's choice, it is inferior to none, in the purity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of the motives which &s;ugge&s;ted it.</P>
<P>How the following work may be re|ceived, I pretend not to foretell. My fir&s;t prayer concerning it is, that it may do good to any: my &s;econd hope, that it may a&s;&s;i&s;t, what it hath always been my earne&s;t wi&s;h to promote, the reli|gious part of an academical education. If in this latter view it might &s;eem, in any degree, to excu&s;e your Lord&s;hip's
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
judgment of its author, I &s;hall be gra|tified by the reflection, that, to a kind|ne&s;s flowing from public principles, I have made the be&s;t public return in my power.</P>
<P>In the mean time, and in every event, I rejoice in the opportunity here afford|ed me, of te&s;tifying the &s;en&s;e I enter|tain of your Lord&s;hip's conduct, and of a notice which I regard, as the mo&s;t flat|tering di&s;tinction of my life.</P>

<HEAD>Preparatory Con&s;iderations.</HEAD>
<P>I DEEM it unnece&s;&s;ary to prove that man|kind &s;tood in need of a revelation, becau&s;e I have met with no &s;erious per&s;on who thinks that even under the Chri&s;tian revela|tion we have too much light, or any degree of a&s;&s;urance which is &s;uperfluous. I de&s;ire moreover that in judging of Chri&s;tianity it may be remembered, that the que&s;tion lies between this religion and none: for if the Chri&s;tian religion be not credible, no one, with whom we have to do, will &s;upport the preten&s;ions of any other.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then the world we live in to have had a Creator; &s;uppo&s;e it to appear from
<PB N="2" REF="13">
the predominant aim and tendency of the provi&s;ions and contrivances ob&s;ervable in the univer&s;e, that the Deity, when he formed it, con&s;ulted for the happine&s;s of his &s;en&s;itive creation; &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;po&s;ition which die|tated this council to continue: &s;uppo&s;e a part of the creation to have received faculties from their Maker, by which they are capa|ble of rendering a moral obedience to his will, and of voluntarily pur&s;uing any end for which he has de&s;igned them; &s;uppo&s;e the Creator to intend for the&s;e his rational and accountable agents a &s;econd &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence, in which their &s;ituation will be regu|lated by their behaviour in the fir&s;t &s;tate, by which &s;uppo&s;ition (and by no other) the ob|jection to the Divine government in not put|ting a difference between the good and the bad, and the incon&s;i&s;tency of this confu&s;ion with the care and benevolence di&s;coverable in the works of the Deity is done away; &s;up|po&s;e it to be of the utmo&s;t importance to the &s;ubjects of this di&s;pen&s;ation to know what is intended f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r them, that is, &s;uppo&s;e the know|ledge of it to be highly conducive to the
<PB N="3" REF="14">
happine&s;s of the &s;pecies, a purpo&s;e which &s;o many provi&s;ions of nature are calculated to promote: Suppo&s;e, neverthele&s;s, almo&s;t the whole race, either by the imperfection of their faculties, the misfortune of their &s;i|tuation, or by the lo&s;s of &s;ome prior revela|tion, to want this knowledge, and not to be likely without the aid of a new revelation to attain it; under the&s;e circum&s;tances is it improbable that a revelation &s;hould be made? Is it incredible that God &s;hould interpo&s;e for &s;uch a purpo&s;e? Suppo&s;e him to de&s;ign for mankind a future &s;tate, is it unlikely that he &s;hould acquaint them with it?</P>
<P>Now in what way can a revelation be made but by miracles? In none which we are able to conceive. Con&s;equently in whatever degree it is probable or not very improbable that a revelation &s;hould be com|municated to mankind at all, in the &s;ame de|gree is it probable or not very improbable that miracles &s;hould be wrought. Therefore when miracles are related to have been wrought in the promulgating of a revelation
<PB N="4" REF="15">
manife&s;tly wanted, and, if true, of ine&s;timable value, the improbability which ari&s;es from the miraculous nature of the things related, is not greater than the original im|probability that &s;uch a revelation &s;hould be imparted by God.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it however to be correctly un|der&s;tood, in what manner, and to what ex|tent, this argument is alledged. We do not a&s;&s;ume the attributes of the Deity, or the exi&s;tence of a future &s;tate, in order to <HI>prove</HI> the reality of miracles. That reality al|ways mu&s;t be proved by evidence. We a&s;|&s;ert only that in miracles adduced in &s;up|port of revelation, there is not any &s;uch an|tecedent improbability as no te&s;timony can &s;urmount. And, for the purpo&s;e of main|taining this a&s;&s;ertion, we contend, that the incredibility of miracles related to have been wrought in atte&s;tation of a me&s;&s;age from God, conveying intelligence of a fu|ture &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, and teaching mankind how to prepare them&s;elves for that &s;tate, is not in it&s;elf greater than the
<PB N="5" REF="16">
event, call it either probable or improbable, of the two following propo&s;itions being true; namely, fir&s;t, that a future &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence &s;hould be de&s;tined by God for his human creation, and &s;econdly, that, being &s;o de&s;tined, he &s;hould acquaint them with it. It is not nece&s;&s;ary for our purpo&s;e that the&s;e propo&s;itions be capable of proof, or even that, by arguments drawn from the light of nature, they can be made out to be probable. It is enough that we are able to &s;ay concerning them, that they are not &s;o violently improbable, &s;o contradictory to what we already believe of the Divine power and character, that either the propo&s;itions them&s;elves, or facts &s;trictly connected with the propo&s;itions, (and therefore no farther improbable than they are improbable) ought to be rejected at fir&s;t &s;ight, and to be re|jected by whatever &s;trength or complication of evidence they be atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>This is the prejudication we would re|&s;i&s;t. For to this length does a modern ob|jection to miracles go, viz. that no human
<PB N="6" REF="17">
te&s;timony can in any ca&s;e render them cre|dible. I think the reflection above &s;tated, that, if there be a revelation, there mu&s;t be miracles; and that, under the circum&s;tances in which the human &s;pecies are placed, a re|velation is not improbable, or not improba|ble in any great degree, to be a fair an&s;wer to the whole objection.</P>
<P>But &s;ince it is an objection which &s;tands in the very thre&s;hold of our argument, and, if admitted, is a bar to every proof, and to all future rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject, it may be nece&s;&s;ary, before we proceed farther, to examine the principle upon which it pro|fe&s;&s;es to be founded: which principle is con|ci&s;ely this, that it is contrary to experience that a miracle &s;hould be true, but not con|trary to experience that te&s;timony &s;hould be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Now there appears a &s;mall ambiguity in the term "experience," and in the phra&s;es "contrary to experience," or "contradict|ing experience," which it may be nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="7" REF="18">
to remove in the fir&s;t place. Strictly &s;peak|ing, the narrative of a fact is <HI>then</HI> only con|trary to experience, when the fact is related to have exi&s;ted at a time and place, at which time and place we being pre&s;ent, did not perceive it to exi&s;t; as if it &s;hould be a&s;|&s;erted, that in a particular room, and at a par|ticular hour of a certain day, a man was rai&s;ed from the dead, in which room, and at the time &s;pecified, we being pre&s;ent and looking on, perceived no &s;uch event to have taken place. Here the a&s;&s;ertion is contrary to experience properly &s;o called; and this is a contrariety which no evidence can &s;urmount. It matters nothing, whether the fact be of a miraculous nature or not. But although this be the experience, and the contrariety, which Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on alledged in the quotation with which Mr. Hume opens his e&s;&s;ay, it is certainly not that experience, nor that contrariety, which Mr. Hume him&s;elf intended to object. And, &s;hort of this, I know no intelligible &s;ignification which can be affixed to the term "contrary to expe|rience," but one, viz. that of not having
<PB N="8" REF="19">
our&s;elves experienced any thing &s;imilar to the thing related, or &s;uch things not being generally experienced by others. I &s;ay not "generally," for to &s;tate concerning the fact in que&s;tion, that no &s;uch thing was <HI>ever</HI> ex|perienced, or that <HI>univer&s;al</HI> experience is again&s;t it, is to a&s;&s;ume the &s;ubject of the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Now the improbability which ari&s;es from the want (for this properly is a want, not a contradiction) of experience, is only equal to the probability there is, that if the thing were true, we &s;hould experience things &s;i|milar to it, or that &s;uch things would be ge|nerally experienced. Suppo&s;e it then to be true that miracles were wrought upon the fir&s;t promulgation of Chri&s;tianity, when no|thing but miracles could decide its autho|rity, is it certain that &s;uch miracles would be repeated &s;o often, and in &s;o many places, as to become objects of general experience? Is it a probability approaching to certainty? Is it a probability of any great &s;trength or force? Is it &s;uch as no evidence can encounter?
<PB N="9" REF="20">
and yet this probability is the ex|act <HI>conver&s;e,</HI> and therefore the exact mea|&s;ure of the improbability which ari&s;es from the want of experience, and which Mr. Hume repre&s;ents as invincible by human te&s;timony.</P>
<P>It is not like alledging a new law of na|ture, or a new experiment in natural philo|&s;ophy, becau&s;e, when the&s;e are related, it is expected that, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, the &s;ame effect will follow univer&s;ally; and in proportion as this expectation is ju&s;tly entertained, the want of a corre&s;ponding experience negatives the hi&s;tory. But to expect concerning a miracle that it &s;hould &s;ucceed upon repetition, is to expect that which would make it cea&s;e to be a miracle, which is contrary to its nature as &s;uch, and would totally de&s;troy the u&s;e and purpo&s;e for which it was wrought.</P>
<P>The force of experience as an objection to miracles is founded in the pre&s;umption, either that the cour&s;e of nature is invariable,
<PB N="10" REF="21">
or that, i&s; it be ever varied, variations will be frequent and general. Has the nece&s;&s;ity of this alternative been demon&s;trated? Per|mit us to call the cour&s;e of nature the agency of an intelligent Being, and is there any good rea&s;on for judging this &s;tate of the ca&s;e to be probable? Ought we not rather to expect, that &s;uch a Being, upon occa&s;ions of peculiar importance, may interrupt the order which he had appointed, yet, that &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;hould return &s;eldom; that the&s;e interruptions con&s;equently &s;hould be con&s;ined to the experience of a &s;ew; that the want of it, therefore, in many, &s;hould be matter neither of &s;urpri&s;e nor objection?</P>
<P>But as a continuation of the argument from experience it is &s;aid, that, when we advance accounts of miracles, we a&s;&s;ign ef|fects without cau&s;es, or we attribute effects to cau&s;es inadequate to the purpo&s;e, or to cau&s;es of the operation of which we have no experience. Of what cau&s;es, we may a&s;k, and of what effects does the objection &s;peak? If it be an&s;wered that, when we a&s;cribe the
<PB N="11" REF="22">
cure of the pal&s;y to a touch, of blindne&s;s to the anointing of the eyes with clay, or the rai&s;|ing of the dead to a word, we lay our&s;elves open to this imputation, we reply that we a&s;cribe no &s;uch effects to &s;uch cau&s;es. We perceive no virtue or energy in the&s;e things more than in other things of the &s;ame kind. They are merely &s;igns to connect the mira|cle with its end. The effect we a&s;cribe &s;imply to the volition of the Deity; of who&s;e exi&s;tence and power, not to &s;ay of who&s;e pre&s;ence and agency, we have previ|ous and independent proof. We have there|fore all we &s;eek for in the works of rational agents, a &s;ufficient power and an adequate motive. In a word, once believe that there is a God, and miracles are not incredible.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume &s;tates the ca&s;e of miracles to be a conte&s;t of oppo&s;ite improbabilities, that is to &s;ay, a que&s;tion whether it be more im|probable that the miracle &s;hould be true, or the te&s;timony fal&s;e; and this I think a fair account of the controver&s;y. But herein I remark a want of argumentative ju&s;tice, that,
<PB N="12" REF="23">
in de&s;cribing the improbability of miracles, he &s;uppre&s;&s;es all tho&s;e circum&s;tances of ex|tenuation, which re&s;ult from our knowledge of the exi&s;tence, power, and di&s;po&s;ition of the Deity, his concern in the creation, the end an&s;wered by the miracle, the import|ance of that end, and its &s;ub&s;erviency to the plan pur&s;ued in the works of nature. As Mr. Hume has repre&s;ented the que&s;tion, miracles are alike incredible to him who is previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured of the con&s;tant agency of a divine Being, and to him who believes that no &s;uch Being exi&s;ts in the univer&s;e. They are equally incredible, whether related to have been wrought upon occa&s;ions the mo&s;t de&s;erving, and for purpo&s;es the mo&s;t bene|ficial, or for no a&s;&s;ignable end whatever, or for an end confe&s;&s;edly trifling or pernicious. This &s;urely cannot be a correct &s;tatement. In adju&s;ting al&s;o the other &s;ide of the balance, the &s;trength and weight of te&s;ti|mony, this author has provided an an&s;wer to every po&s;&s;ible accumulation of hi&s;torical proof by telling us, that we are not obliged to explain how the &s;tory or the evidence
<PB N="13" REF="24">
aro&s;e. Now I think that we <HI>are</HI> obliged; not, perhaps, to &s;hew by po&s;itive accounts how it did, but by a probable hypothe&s;is how it might &s;o happen. The exi&s;tence of the te&s;timony is a phenomenon. The truth of the fact &s;olves the phenomenon. If we reject this &s;olution we ought to have &s;ome other to re&s;t in; and none even by our ad|ver&s;aries can be admitted, which is not con|&s;i&s;tent with the principles that regulate hu|man affairs and human conduct at pre&s;ent, or which makes men <HI>them</HI> to have been a different kind of beings from what they are now.</P>
<P>But the &s;hort con&s;ideration which, inde|pendently of every other, convinces me that there is no &s;olid foundation in Mr. Hume's conclu&s;ion is the following. When a theo|rem is propo&s;ed to a mathematician, the fir&s;t thing he does with it is to try it upon a &s;imple ca&s;e; and, if it produce a fal&s;e re&s;ult, he is &s;ure that there mu&s;t be &s;ome mi&s;take in the demon&s;tration. Now to pro|ceed in this way with what may be called
<PB N="14" REF="25">
Mr. Hume's theorem. If twelve men, who&s;e probity and good &s;en&s;e I had long known, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly and circum&s;tan|tially relate to me an account of a miracle wrought before their eyes, and in which it was impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be deceived; if the governor of the country, hearing a rumour of this account, &s;hould call the&s;e men into his pre&s;ence, and offer them a &s;hort propo&s;al, either to confe&s;s the impo&s;|ture, or &s;ubmit to be tied up to a gibbet; if they &s;hould refu&s;e with one voice to ac|knowledge that there exi&s;ted any fal&s;ehood or impo&s;ture in the ca&s;e; if this threat were communicated to them &s;eparately, yet with no different effect; if it was at la&s;t executed; if I my&s;elf &s;aw them, one after another, con&s;enting to be racked, burnt, or &s;tran|gled, rather than give up the truth of their account; &s;till, if Mr. Hume's rule be my guide, I am not to believe them. Now I undertake to &s;ay that there exi&s;ts not a &s;ceptic in the world who would not believe them; or who would defend &s;uch incre|dulity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="26">
In&s;tances of &s;purious miracles &s;upported by &s;trong apparent te&s;timony undoubtedly demand examination. Mr. Hume has en|deavoured to forti&s;y his argument by &s;ome examples of this kind. I hope in a proper place to &s;how that none of them reach the &s;trength or circum&s;tances of the Chri&s;tian evidence. In the&s;e however con&s;i&s;ts the weight of his objection. In the principle it&s;elf I am per&s;uaded there is none.</P>

II.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">There is &s;atisfactory evidence that many, pro|fe&s;&s;ing to be original witne&s;&s;es of the Chri&s;|tian miracles, pa&s;&s;ed their lives in labours, dangers and &s;ufferings, voluntarily under|gone in atte&s;tation of the accounts which they delivered, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of tho&s;e accounts; and that they al&s;o &s;ubmitted from the &s;ame motives to new rules of conduct.</HEAD>
<P>To &s;upport this propo&s;ition two points are nece&s;&s;ary to be made out: fir&s;t, that the founder of the in&s;titution, his a&s;&s;ociates and immediate followers, acted the part which the propo&s;ition imputes to them: &s;econdly, that they did &s;o, in atte&s;tation of the mira|culous hi&s;tory recorded in our &s;criptures, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Before we produce any particular te&s;timony
<PB N="20" REF="30">
to the activity and &s;ufferings which compo&s;e the &s;ubject of our fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, it will be proper to con&s;ider the degree of pro|bability which the a&s;&s;ertion derives from the <HI>nature of the ca&s;e,</HI> that is, by inferences from tho&s;e parts of the ca&s;e which, in point of fact, are on all hands acknowledged.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, the Chri&s;tian religion exi&s;ts, and therefore by &s;ome means or other was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Now it either owes the princi|ple of its e&s;tabli&s;hment, <HI>i. e.</HI> its fir&s;t publica|tion, to the activity of the per&s;on who was the founder of the in&s;titution, and of tho&s;e who were joined with him in the undertak|ing, or we are driven upon the &s;trange &s;up|po&s;ition, that, although they might lie by, others would take it up; although they were quiet and &s;ilent, other per&s;ons bu&s;ied them|&s;elves in the &s;ucce&s;s and propagation of their &s;tory. This is perfectly incredible. To me it appears little le&s;s than certain, that, if the fir&s;t announcing of the religion by the founder had not been followed up by the zeal and indu&s;try of his immediate di&s;ciples,
<PB N="21" REF="31">
the attempt mu&s;t have expired in its birth. Then as to the kind and degree of exertion which was employed, and the mode of life to which the&s;e per&s;ons &s;ubmitted, we rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e it to be like that, which we ob&s;erve in all others who voluntarily be|come mi&s;&s;ionaries of a new faith. Frequent, earne&s;t and laborious preaching, con&s;tantly conver&s;ing with religious per&s;ons upon reli|gion, a &s;eque&s;tration from the common plea&s;ures, engagements and varieties of life, and an addiction to one &s;erious object, com|po&s;e the habits of &s;uch men. I do not &s;ay that this mode of life is without enjoy|ment, but I &s;ay that the enjoyment &s;prings from &s;incerity. With a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s at the bottom of hollowne&s;s and fal&s;ehood, the fatigue and re&s;traint would become in|&s;upportable. I am apt to believe that very few hypocrites engage in the&s;e undertak|ings; or, however, per&s;i&s;t in them long. Ordinarily &s;peaking, nothing can overcome the indolence of mankind, the love which is natural to mo&s;t tempers of chearful &s;ociety and chearful &s;cenes, or the de&s;ire, which is
<PB N="22" REF="32">
common to all, of per&s;onal ea&s;e and freedom, but conviction.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is al&s;o highly probable, from the nature of the ca&s;e, that the propagation of the new religion was attended with di&s;&s;i|culty and danger. As addre&s;&s;ed to the Jews it was a &s;y&s;tem, adver&s;e not only to their habitual opinions, but to tho&s;e opinions upon which their hopes, their partialities, their pride, their con&s;olation was founded. This people, with or without rea&s;on, had worked them&s;elves into a per&s;ua&s;ion, that &s;ome &s;ignal and greatly advantageous change was to be effected in the condition of their country, by the agency of a long|promi&s;ed me&s;&s;enger from heaven <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Pererebuerat oriente toto vetus et con&s;tans opinio, e&s;&s;e in fatis, ut eo tempore Judae&acirc; profecti rerum poti|rentur."

<P>"Pluribus per&s;ua&s;io inerat, antiquis &s;acerdotum lite|ris contineri, co ip&s;o tempore &s;ore, ut vale&s;ceret oriens, pro&s;ectique Judae&acirc; rerum potirentur," Tacit. Hi&s;t. lib. v. cap. 9&mdash;13.</P></NOTE>. The rulers of the Jews, their leading &s;ect, their
<PB N="23" REF="33">
prie&s;thood had been the authors of this per|&s;ua&s;ion to the common people. So that it was not merely the conjecture of theoretical divines, or the &s;ecret expectation of a few reclu&s;e devotees, but it was become the popular hope and pa&s;&s;ion, and, like all po|pular opinions, undoubting, and impatient of contradiction. They clung to this hope under every misfortune of their country, and with more tenacity as their dangers or calamities increa&s;ed. To find therefore that expectations &s;o gratifying were to be wor&s;e than di&s;appointed; that they were to end in the diffu&s;ion of a mild unambitious reli|gion, which, in&s;tead of victories and tri|umphs, in&s;tead of exalting their nation and in&s;titution above the re&s;t of the world, was to advance tho&s;e whom they de&s;pi&s;ed to an equality with them&s;elves, in tho&s;e very points of compari&s;on in which they mo&s;t valued their own di&s;tinction, could be no very plea&s;ing di&s;covery to a Jewi&s;h mind; nor could the me&s;&s;engers of &s;uch intelligence expect to be well received or ea&s;ily credited. The doctrine was equally har&s;h and novel.
<PB N="24" REF="34">
The extending of the kingdom of God to tho&s;e who did not conform to the law of Mo&s;es, was a notion that had never before entered into the thoughts of a Jew.</P>
<P>The character of the new in&s;titution was, in other re&s;pects al&s;o, ungrateful to Jewi&s;h habits and principles. Their own religion was in a high degree technical. Even the enlightened Jew placed a great deal of &s;tre&s;s upon the ceremonies of his law, &s;aw in them a great deal of virtue and efficacy; the gro&s;s and vulgar had &s;carcely any thing el&s;e; and the hypocritical and o&s;tentatious magnified them above mea&s;ure, as being the in&s;truments of their own reputation and in|fluence. The Chri&s;tian &s;cheme, without formally repealing the Levitical code, low|ered its e&s;timation extremely. In the place of &s;trictne&s;s and zeal in performing the ob|&s;ervances which that code pre&s;cribed, or which tradition had added to it, the new &s;ect preached up faith, well-regulated affections, inward purity and moral rectitude of di&s;po|&s;ition, as the true ground, on the part of the
<PB N="25" REF="35">
wor&s;hlpper, of merit and acceptance with God. This, however rational it may appear, or recommending to us at pre&s;ent, did not by any means facilitate the plan then. On the contrary, to di&s;parage tho&s;e qualities which the highe&s;t characters in the country valued them&s;elves mo&s;t upon, was a &s;ure way of making powerful enemies. As if the fru&s;tration of the national hope was not enough, the long-e&s;teemed merit of ritual zeal and punctuality was to be decried, and that by Jews preaching to Jews.</P>
<P>The ruling party at Jeru&s;alem had ju&s;t before crucified the founder of the religion. That is a fact which will not be di&s;puted. They therefore who &s;tood forth to preach the religion, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily reproach the&s;e rulers with an execution, which they could not but repre&s;ent as an unju&s;t and cruel murder. This would not render their office more ea&s;y, or their &s;ituation more &s;afe.</P>
<P>With regard to the interference of the
<PB N="26" REF="36">
Roman government which was then e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Judea, I &s;hould not expect, that, de&s;pi&s;ing, as it did, the religion of the coun|try, it would, if left to it&s;elf, animadvert, either with much vigilance, or much &s;eve|rity, upon the &s;chi&s;ms and controver&s;ies which aro&s;e within it. Yet there was that in Chri&s;tianity which might ea&s;ily afford a handle of accu&s;ation with a jealous govern|ment. The Chri&s;tians avowed an unquali|fied obedience to a new ma&s;ter. They avowed al&s;o that he was the per&s;on who had been foretold to the Jews under the &s;u&s;pect|ed title of King. The &s;piritual nature of this kingdom, the con&s;i&s;tency of this obedi|ence with civil &s;ubjection, were di&s;tinctions too refined to be entertained by a Roman pre&s;ident, who viewed the bu&s;ine&s;s at a great di&s;tance, or through the medium of very ho&s;tile repre&s;entations. Our hi&s;tories ac|cordingly inform us, that this was the turn which the enemies of Je&s;us gave to his cha|racter and preten&s;ions in their remon&s;trances with Pontius Pilate. And Ju&s;tin Martyr, about a hundred years afterwards, complains
<PB N="27" REF="37">
that the &s;ame mi&s;take prevailed in his time; "ye having heard that we are waiting for a kingdom, &s;uppo&s;e, without di&s;tingui&s;hing, that we mean a human kingdom, when in truth we &s;peak of that which is with God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ap. 1^m^e. p. 16. ed. Thirl,</NOTE>." And it was undoubtedly a natural &s;ource of calumny and mi&s;con&s;truction.</P>
<P>The preachers therefore of Chri&s;tianity had to contend with prejudice, backed by power. They had to come forward to a di&s;appointed people, to a prie&s;thood po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;hare of municipal au|thority, and actuated by &s;trong motives of oppo&s;ition and re&s;entment; and they had to do this under a foreign government, to who&s;e favour they made no preten&s;ions, and which was con&s;tantly &s;urrounded by their enemics. The well known, becau&s;e the experienced, fate of reformers, whenever the reformation &s;ubverts &s;ome reigning opinion, and does not proceed upon a change already taken place in the &s;entiments of a country, will
<PB N="28" REF="38">
not allow, much le&s;s lead us, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the fir&s;t propagators of Chri&s;tianity at Jeru&s;alem and in Judea, with the difficulties and the enemies which they had to contend with, and entirely de&s;titute, as they were, of force, authority or protection, could exe|cute their mi&s;&s;ion with per&s;onal ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>Let us next enquire what might rea&s;on|ably be expected by the preachers of Chri&s;tianity when they turned them&s;elves to the heathen public. Now the fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes us is, that the religion they car|ried with them was <HI>exclu&s;ive.</HI> It denied without re&s;erve the truth of every article of heathen mythology, the exi&s;tence of every object of their wor&s;hip. It accepted no compromi&s;e: it admitted no comprehen&s;ion. It mu&s;t prevail, if it prevailed at all, by the overthrow of every &s;tatue, altar and temple, in the world. It will not ea&s;ily be credited that a de&s;ign, &s;o bold as this was, could in any age be attempted to be carried into exe|cution with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="39">
For it ought to be con&s;idered, that this was not &s;etting forth, or magnifying the character and wor&s;hip of &s;ome new com|petitor for a place in the Pantheon, who&s;e preten&s;ions might be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed or afferted without que&s;tioning the reality of any others. It was pronouncing all other gods to be fal&s;e, and all other wor&s;hip vain. From the facility with which the Polythei&s;m of an|cient nations admitted new objects of wor|&s;hip into the number of their acknowledged divinities, or the patience with which they might entertain propo&s;als of this kind, we can argue nothing as to their toleration of a &s;y&s;tem, or of the publi&s;hers and active propagators of a &s;y&s;tem, which &s;wept away the very foundation of the exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. The one was nothing more than what it would be, in Popi&s;h countries, to add a &s;aint to the calendar; the other was to aboli&s;h and tread under foot the calendar it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Secondly, it ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that this was not the ca&s;e of philo&s;ophers
<PB N="30" REF="40">
propounding in their books, or in their &s;chools, doubts concerning the truth of the popular creed, or even avowing their di&s;|belief of it. The&s;e philo&s;ophers did not go about from place to place to collect pro&s;elytes from among&s;t the common-people; to form in the heart of the country &s;ocieties profe&s;&s;|ing their tenets; to provide for the order, in&s;truction and permanency of the&s;e &s;ocie|ties; nor did they enjoin their followers to withdraw them&s;elves from the public wor|&s;hip of the temples, or refu&s;e a compliance with rites in&s;tituted by the laws <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The be&s;t of the ancient philo&s;ophers, Plato, Cicero and Epictetus, allowed, or rather enjoined, men to wor|&s;hip the gods of the country, and in the e&s;tabli&s;hed form. See pa&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e, collected from their works by Dr. Clarke, Nat. and Rev. Rel. p. 180, ed. v. Except Socrates, they all thought it wi&s;er to comply with the laws, than to contend.</NOTE>. The&s;e things are what the Chri&s;tians did, and what the philo&s;ophers did not: and in the&s;e con|&s;i&s;ted the activity and danger of the en|terpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered,
<PB N="31" REF="41">
that this danger proceeded not merely from &s;olemn acts and public re&s;olutions of the &s;tate, but from &s;udden bur&s;ts of violence at particular places, from the licence of the po|pulace, the ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome magi&s;trates and the negligence of others, from the influence and in&s;tigation of intere&s;ted adver&s;aries, and, in general, from the variety and warmth of opinion which an errand &s;o novel and ex|traordinary could not fail of exciting. I can conceive that the teachers of Chri&s;tianity might both fear and &s;u&s;&s;er much from the&s;e cau&s;es, without any general per&s;ecution be|ing denouncedag a in&s;t them by imperial au|thority. Some length of time, I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e, might pa&s;s, before the va&s;t machine of the Roman empire would be put in mo|tion, or its attention be obtained to religious controver&s;y; but, during that time, a great deal of ill u&s;age might be endured, by a &s;et of friendle&s;s, unprotected travellers, telling men, wherever they came, that the religion of their ance&s;tors, the religion in which they had been brought up, the religion of
<PB N="32" REF="42">
the &s;tate and of the magi&s;trate, the rites which they frequented, the pomp which they admired, was throughout a &s;y&s;tem of folly and delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that the teachers of Chri&s;|tianity would &s;ind protection in that gene|ral di&s;belief of the popular theology, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have prevailed among&s;t the intelligent part of the heathen public. It is by no means true that unbelievers are u&s;u|ally tolerant. They are not di&s;po&s;ed (and why &s;hould they?) to endanger the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, by &s;uffering a religion of which they believe nothing, to be di&s;turbed by another of which they believe as little. They are ready them&s;elves to conform to any thing; and are, oftentimes, among&s;t the foremo&s;t to procure conformity from others, by any method which they think likely to be e&s;&s;icacious. When was ever a change of religion patronized by in&s;idels? How little, notwith&s;tanding the reigning &s;ceptici&s;m, and the magnified liberality, of that age, the true
<PB N="33" REF="43">
principles of toleration were under&s;tood by the wi&s;e&s;t men among&s;t them, may be ga|thered from two eminent and unconte&s;ted examples. The younger Pliny, poli&s;hed, as he was, by all the literature of that &s;oft and elegant period, could gravely pronounce this mon&s;troiis judgment: "Tho&s;e, who per&s;i&s;ted in declaring them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, I ordered to be led away to puni&s;hment (<HI>i. e.</HI> to execution), for I DID NOT DOUBT, <HI>whatever it was that they confe&s;&s;ed, that contumacy and inflexible ob&s;tinacy ought to be puni&s;hed."</HI> His ma&s;ter, Trajan, a mild and accompli&s;hed prince, went, neverthele&s;s, no farther in his &s;entiments of moderation and equity, than what appears in the following re&s;cript: "The Chri&s;tians are not to be &s;ought for; but if any are brought before you, and convicted, they are to be pu|ni&s;hed." And this direction he gives, after it had been reported to him by his own pre&s;ident, that, by the mo&s;t &s;trict examina|tion, nothing could be di&s;covered in the principles of the&s;e per&s;ons, but "a bad and exce&s;&s;ive &s;uper&s;tition," accompanied, it
<PB N="34" REF="44">
&s;eems, with an oath or mutual federation, "to allow them&s;elves in no crime or im|moral conduct whatever." The truth is, the ancient heathens con&s;idered religion en|tirely as an affair of &s;tate, as much under the tuition of the magi&s;trate as any other part of the police. The religion of that age was not merely allied to the &s;tate: it was incorporated into it. Many of its of|fices were admini&s;tered by the magi&s;trate. Its titles of pontiffs, augurs, and flamens, were borne by &s;enators, con&s;uls and gene|rals. Without di&s;cu&s;&s;ing therefore the truth of the theology, they re&s;ented every affront put upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, as a di|rect oppo&s;ition to the authority of govern|ment.</P>
<P>Add to which, that the religious &s;y&s;tems of tho&s;e times, however ill &s;upported by evidence, had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed. The <HI>ancient</HI> religion of a country has always many votaries, and &s;ometimes not the fewer becau&s;e its origin is hidden in remotene&s;s and ob&s;curity. Men have a natural veneration
<PB N="35" REF="45">
for antiquity, e&s;pecially in matters of religion. What Tacitus &s;ays of the Jewi&s;h, was more applicable to the heathen e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, "hi ritus, quoquo modo inducti, an|tiquitate defenduntur." It was al&s;o a &s;plendid and &s;umptuous wor&s;hip. It had its prie&s;t|hood, its endowments, its temples. Statu|ary, painting, architecture, and mu&s;ic, con|tributed their effect to its ornament and magnificence. It abounded in fe&s;tival &s;hows and &s;olemnities, to which the common peo|ple are greatly addicted; and which were of a nature to engage them much more than any thing of that &s;ort among us. The&s;e things would retain great numbers on its &s;ide by the fa&s;cination of &s;pectacle and pomp, as well as intere&s;t many in its pre&s;er|vation by the advantage which they drew from it. "It was moreover interwoven," as Mr. Gibbons rightly repre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">t it, "with every circum&s;tance of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, of public or private life, with all the offices and amu&s;ements of &s;ociety."

pro&s;perity of their country in a great mea|&s;ure depended.</P>
<P>I am willing to accept the account of the matter which is given by Mr. Gibbon: "The various modes of wor&s;hip which pre|vailed in the Roman world, were all con|&s;idered by the people as equally true, by the philo&s;ophers as equally fal&s;e, and by the magi&s;trate as equally u&s;eful:" and I would a&s;k, from which of the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es of men were the Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ionaries to look for protection or impunity? Could they expect it from the people, "who&s;e ac|knowledged con&s;idence in the public reli|gion" they &s;ubverted from its foundation? from the philo&s;opher, who, "con&s;idering all religions as equally fal&s;e," would of cour&s;e rank theirs among&s;t the number, with the addition of regarding them as bu&s;y and trouble&s;ome zealots? or from the magi&s;trate, who, &s;atisfied with the "utility" of the &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting religion, would not be likely to coun|tenance a &s;pirit of pro&s;elyti&s;m and innova|tion; a &s;y&s;tem, which declared war again&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="47">
every other, and which, if it prevailed, mu&s;t end in a total rupture of public opi|nion; an up&s;tart religion, in a word, which was not content with its own authority, but mu&s;t di&s;grace all the &s;ettled religions of the world? It was not to be imagined that he would endure with patience, that the reli|gion of the emperor and of the &s;tate &s;hould be calumniated and borne down, by a com|pany of &s;uper&s;titious and de&s;picable Jews.</P>
<P>La&s;tly; the <HI>nature of the ca&s;e</HI> affords a &s;trong proof, that the original teachers of Chri&s;tianity, in con&s;equence of their new profe&s;&s;ion, entered upon a new and &s;ingular cour&s;e of life. We may be allowed to pre|&s;ume, that the in&s;titution which they preach|ed to others, they conformed to in their own per&s;ons; becau&s;e this is no more than what every teacher of a new religion both does, and mu&s;t do, in order to obtain either pro&s;elytes or hearers. The change which this would produce was very con&s;iderable. It is a change which we do not ea&s;ily e&s;ti|mate, becau&s;e, our&s;elves and all about us
<PB N="38" REF="48">
being habituated to the in&s;titution from our infancy, it is what we neither experience nor ob&s;erve. After men became Chri&s;tians, much of their time was &s;pent in prayer and devotion, in religious meetings, in celebrat|ing the euchari&s;t, in conferences, in exhor|tations, in preaching, in an affectionate in|tercour&s;e with one another, and corre&s;pond|ence with other &s;ocieties. Perhaps their mode of life in its form and habit was not very unlike the Unitas Fratrum, or of mo|dern Methodi&s;ts. Think then what it was to become <HI>&s;uch</HI> at Corinth, at Ephe&s;us, at Antioch, or even at Jeru&s;alem. How new! How aliene from all their former habits and ideas, and from tho&s;e of every body about them! What a revolution there mu&s;t have been of opinions and prejudices to bring the matter to this!</P>
<P>We know what the precepts of the reli|gion are; how pure, how benevolent, how di&s;intere&s;ted a conduct they enjoin; and that this purity and benevolence is extended to the very thoughts and affections. We
<PB N="39" REF="49">
are not perhaps at liberty to take for granted, that the lives of the preachers of Chri&s;tianity were as perfect as their le&s;&s;ons: but we are entitled to contend, that the ob|&s;ervable part of their behaviour mu&s;t have agreed in a great mea&s;ure with the duties which they taught. There was therefore, which is all that we a&s;&s;ert, a cour&s;e of life pur&s;ued by them, different from that which they before led. And this is of great im|portance. Men are brought to any thing almo&s;t &s;ooner than to change their habit of life, e&s;pecially, when the change is either inconvenient, or made again&s;t the force of natural inclination, or with the lo&s;s of ac|cu&s;tomed indulgences. "It is the mo&s;t dif|ficult of all things to convert men from vi|cious habits to virtuous ones, as every one may judge from what he &s;eels in him&s;elf, as well as from what he &s;ees in others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hartley's E&s;&s;. on Man, p. 190.</NOTE>."

more information than a knowledge of the exi&s;tence of the religion, of the general &s;tory upon which it is founded, and that no act of power, force, or authority, was con|cerned in its fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hould conclude, from the very nature and exigency of the ca&s;e, that the author of the religion during his life, and his immediate di&s;ciples after his death, <HI>exerled</HI> them&s;elves in &s;preading and publi&s;hing the in&s;titution throughout the country in which it began, and into which it was fir&s;t carried; that, in the pro&s;ecution of this purpo&s;e, they underwent the labours and troubles, which we ob&s;erve the propa|gators of new &s;ects to undergo: that the at|tempt mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have al&s;o been in a high degree dangerous; that from the &s;ubject of the mi&s;&s;ion, compared with the fixed opi|nions and prejudices of tho&s;e to whom the mi&s;&s;ionaries were to addre&s;s them&s;elves, they could hardly fail of encountering &s;trong and &s;requent oppo&s;ition; that, by the hand of government, as well as from the &s;udden &s;ury and unbridled licence of the people, they would oftentimes experience injurious

which &s;ome of the heathen writers of that age had gained, and which a few pa&s;|&s;ages in their remaining works incidentally di&s;cover to us, offers it&s;elf to our notice in the fir&s;t place: becau&s;e, &s;o far as this evidence goes, it is the conce&s;&s;ion of adver&s;aries; the &s;ource from which it is drawn is un&s;u&s;pected. Under this head a quotation from Tacitus, well known to every &s;cholar, mu&s;t be in&s;ert|ed as de&s;erving of particular attention. The Reader will bear in mind that this pa&s;&s;age was written about &s;eventy years after Chri&s;t's death, and that it relates to tran&s;actions which took place about thirty years after that event. Speaking of the fire which hap|pened at Rome in the time of Nero, and of the &s;u&s;picions which were entertained that the emperor him&s;elf was concerned in cau&s;|ing it, the hi&s;torian proceeds in his narrative and ob&s;ervations thus:</P>
<Q>"But neither the&s;e exertions, nor his lar|ge&s;&s;es to the people, nor his offerings to the gods, did away the infamous imputation
<PB N="44" REF="54">
under which Nero lay, of having ordered the city to be &s;et on fire. To put an end therefore to this report, he laid the guilt, and inflicted the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hments upon a &s;et of people, who were held in abhorrence for their crimes, and called by the vulgar <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> The founder of that name was Chri&s;t, who &s;uffered death in the reign of Tiberius, under his procurator Pon|tius Pilate.&mdash;This pernicious &s;uper&s;tition, thus checked for a while, broke out again; and &s;pread not only over Judea, where the evil originated, but through Rome al&s;o, whither every thing bad upon earth finds its way, and is practi&s;ed. Some who con|fe&s;&s;ed their &s;ect were fir&s;t &s;eized, and after|wards by their information a va&s;t multitude were apprehended, who were convicted, not &s;o much of the crime of burning Rome, as of hatred to mankind. Their &s;ufferings at their execution were aggravated by in&s;ult and mockery, for &s;ome were di&s;gui&s;ed in the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, and worried to death by dogs&mdash;&s;ome were crucified&mdash;and others

were wrapt in pitched &s;hirts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is rather a paraphra&s;e, but is ju&s;tified by what the Scholia&s;t upon Juvenal &s;ays&mdash;"Nero male&s;icos ho|mines ted&acirc; et papyro et cer&acirc; &s;uperve&s;tiebat, et &s;ic ad ignem admoveri jubebat." Lard. Jewi&s;h and Heath. Te&s;t. vol. i. p. 359.</NOTE>, and &s;et on fire when the day clo&s;ed, that they might &s;erve as lights to illuminate the night. Nero lent his own gardens for the&s;e executions; and exhibited at the &s;ame time a mock Cir|cen&s;ian entertainment, being a &s;pectator of the whole in the dre&s;s of a charioteer, &s;ome|times mingling with the crowd on foot, and &s;ometimes viewing the &s;pectacles from his car. This conduct made the &s;u&s;&s;erers pitied; and though they were criminals, and de&s;erving the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment, yet they were con&s;idered as &s;acri&s;iced, not &s;o much out of a regard to the public good, as to gratify the cruelty of one man."</Q>
<P>Our concern with this pa&s;&s;age at pre&s;ent is only &s;o far, as it affords a pre&s;umption in &s;upport of the propo&s;ition which we main|tain, concerning the activity and &s;ufferings
<PB N="46" REF="56">
of the fir&s;t teachers of Chri&s;tianity. Now, con&s;idered in this view, it proves three things: 1&s;t, that the founder of the in&s;titution was put to death; 2dly, that, in the &s;ame country in which he was put to death, the religion, after a &s;hort check, broke out again and &s;pread; 3dly, that it &s;o &s;pread, as that, within thirty-four years from the author's death, a very great number of Chri&s;tians (ingens eorum multitudo) were found at Rome. From which fact, the two follow|ing inferences may be fairly drawn: fir&s;t, that, if, in the &s;pace of thirty-four years from its commencement, the religion had &s;pread throughout Judea, had extended it|&s;elf to Rome, and there had numbered a great multitude of converts, the original teachers and mi&s;&s;ionaries of the in&s;titution could not have been <HI>idle;</HI> &s;econdly, that when the author of the undertaking was put to death as a malefactor for his attempt, the endeavours of his followers to e&s;tabli&s;h his religion, in the &s;ame country, among&s;t the &s;ame people, and in the &s;ame age, could not but be attended with danger.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="57">
Suetonius, a writer contemporary with Tacitus, de&s;cribing the tran&s;actions of the &s;ame reign, u&s;es the&s;e words, "Affecti &s;uppli|ciis Chri&s;tiani, genus hominum &s;uper&s;titionis novae et male&s;icae <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suet. Nero. cap. 16.</NOTE>." "The Chri&s;tians, a &s;et of men, of a new and mi&s;chievous (or magi|cal) &s;uper&s;tition, were puni&s;hed."</P>
<P>Since it is not mentioned <HI>here</HI> that the burning of the city was the pretence of the puni&s;hment of the Chri&s;tians, or that they were the Chri&s;tians of Rome who alone &s;uffered, it is probable that Suetonius refers to &s;ome more general per&s;ecution than the &s;hort and occa&s;ional one which Tacitus de|&s;cribes.</P>
<P>Juvenal, a writer of the &s;ame age with the two former, and intending, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to commemorate the cruelties exerci&s;ed un|der Nero's government, has the following lines <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sat. 1, ver. 155.</NOTE>:</P>

<P>If this pa&s;&s;age were con&s;idered by it&s;elf, the &s;ubject of the allu&s;ion might be doubt|ful; but when connected with the te&s;timony of Suetonius, as to the actual puni&s;hment of the Chri&s;tians by Nero; and with the ac|count given by Tacitus of the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of puni&s;hment which they were made to un|dergo; I think it &s;ufficiently probable, that the&s;e were the executions to which the poet refers.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, as hath already been ob&s;erved,
<PB N="49" REF="59">
took place within thirty-one years after Chri&s;t's death, that is, according to the cour&s;e of nature, in the life-time, probably, of &s;ome of the apo&s;tles, and certainly in the life-time of tho&s;e who were converted by the apo&s;tles, or who were converted in their time. If then the founder of the religion was put to death in the execution of his de|&s;ign; if the fir&s;t race of converts to the reli|gion, many of them &s;uffered the greate&s;t extremities for their profe&s;&s;ion; it is hardly credible, that tho&s;e who came <HI>between</HI> the two, who were companions of the author of the in&s;titution during his life, and the teachers and propagators of the in&s;titution after his death, could go about their undertaking with ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of the younger Pliny be|longs to a later period; for although he was contemporary with Tacitus and Suetonius, yet his account does not, like theirs, go back to the tran&s;actions of Nero's reign, but is confined to the affairs of his own time. His celebrated letter to Trajan was written
<PB N="50" REF="60">
about &s;eventy years after Chri&s;t's death; and the information to be drawn from it; &s;o far as it is connected with our argument, relates principally to two points: fir&s;t, to the <HI>number</HI> of Chri&s;tians in Bithynia and Pontus, which was &s;o con&s;iderable as to in|duce the governor of the&s;e provinces to &s;peak of them in the following terms, "Multi, omnis aetatis, utriu&s;que &s;ex&ucirc;s etiam&mdash;neque enim civitates tantum, &s;ed vicos etiam et agros, &s;uper&s;titionis i&s;tius contagio pervagata e&s;t." "There are many of every age and of both &s;exes&mdash;nor has the contagion of this &s;uper&s;tition &s;eized cities only, but &s;maller towns al&s;o, and the open country." Great exertions mu&s;t have been u&s;ed by the preachers of Chri&s;tianity to produce this &s;tate of things within this time. Se|condly, to a point which hath been already noticed, and which I think of importance to be ob&s;erved, namely, the &s;ufferings to which Chri&s;tians were expo&s;ed, <HI>without</HI> any public per&s;ecution being denounced again&s;t them by &s;overeign authority. For, from Pliny's doubt how he was to act, his &s;ilence
<PB N="51" REF="61">
concerning any &s;ub&s;i&s;ting law upon the &s;ub|ject, his reque&s;ting the emperor's re&s;cript, and the emperor, agreeably to his reque&s;t, propounding a rule for his direction, with|out reference to any prior rule, it may be inferred, that there was, at that time, no public edict again&s;t the Chri&s;tians in force. Yet from this &s;ame epi&s;tle of Pliny it ap|pears "that accu&s;ations, trials and examina|tions were, and had been, going on again&s;t them, in the provinces over which he pre|&s;ided; that &s;chedules were delivered by anonymous informers, containing the names of per&s;ons who were &s;u&s;pected of holding or of favouring the religion; that, in con|&s;equence of the&s;e informations, many had been apprehended, of whom &s;ome boldly avowed their profe&s;&s;ion, and died in the cau&s;e; others denied that they were Chri&s;|tians; others, acknowledging that they had once been Chri&s;tians, declared that they had long cea&s;ed to be &s;uch." All which demon|&s;trates, that the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity was at that time (in that country at lea&s;t) attended with fear and danger: and yet this
<PB N="52" REF="62">
took place without any edict from the Roman &s;overeign, commanding or authoriz|ing the per&s;ecution of Chri&s;tians. This ob|&s;ervation is farther con&s;irmed by a re&s;cript of Adrian to Minucius Fundanus, the pro|con&s;ul of A&s;ia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. Heath. Te&s;t. v. ii. p. 110.</NOTE>: from which re&s;cript it ap|pears that the cu&s;tom of the people of A&s;ia was to proceed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians with tumult and uproar. This di&s;orderly practice, I &s;ay, is recognized in the edict, becau&s;e the emperor enjoins, that, for the future, if the Chri&s;tians were guilty they &s;hould be legally brought to trial, and not be pur&s;ued by im|portunity and clamour.</P>
<P>Martial wrote a few years before the younger Pliny; and, as his manner was, made the &s;ufferings of the Chri&s;tians the &s;ubject of his ridicule <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In matutin&acirc; nuper &s;pectatus aren&acirc; Mucius, impo&s;uit qui &s;ua membra focis, Si patiens forti&s;que tibi duru&s;que videtur, Abderitanae pectora plebis habes; Nam cum dicatur tunic&acirc; prae&s;ente mole&s;t&acirc;, Ure <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For&s;an "thure manum."</NOTE> manum, plus e&s;t dicere, non facio.</NOTE>. Nothing however
<PB N="53" REF="63">
could &s;hew the notoriety of the fact with more certainty than this does. Martial's te&s;timony, as well indeed as Pliny's, goes al&s;o to another point, viz. that the deaths of the&s;e men were martyrdoms in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, that is to &s;ay, were &s;o voluntary, that it was in their power, at the time of pro|nouncing the &s;entence, to have averted the execution, by con&s;enting to join in heathen &s;acri&s;ices.</P>

<P>OF the primitive condition of Chri&s;tianity, a di&s;tant only and general view can be ac|quired from heathen writers. It is in our own books that the detail and interior of the tran&s;action mu&s;t be &s;ought for. And this is nothing different from what might be ex|pected. Who would write a hi&s;tory of Chri&s;tianity but a Chri&s;tian? Who was likely to record the travels, &s;ufferings, labours, or &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the apo&s;tles, but one of their own number, or of their followers? Now
<PB N="56" REF="66">
the&s;e books come up in their accounts to the full extent of the propo&s;ition which we maintain. We have four hi&s;tories of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We have a hi&s;tory taking up the narrative from his death, and carrying on an account of the propagation of the religion, and of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons en|gaged in it, for a &s;pace of nearly thirty years. We have, what &s;ome may think &s;till more original, a collection of letters, written by certain principal agents in the bu&s;ine&s;s, upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the mid&s;t of their con|cern and connection with it. And we have the&s;e writings &s;everally atte&s;ting the point which we contend for, viz. the &s;ufferings of the witne&s;&s;es of the hi&s;tory, and atte&s;ting it in every variety of form in which it can be conceived to appear; directly and indirect|ly, expre&s;sly and incidentally, by a&s;&s;ertion, recital, and allu&s;ion, by narratives of facts, and by arguments and di&s;cour&s;es built upon the&s;e facts, either referring to them, or ne|ce&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>I remark this variety, becau&s;e in examining
<PB N="57" REF="67">
ancient records, or indeed any &s;pecies of te&s;timony, it is, in my opinion, of the greate&s;t importance to attend to the informa|tion or grounds of argument which are <HI>ca&s;ually</HI> and <HI>unde&s;ignedly</HI> di&s;clo&s;ed; fora&s;much as this &s;pecies of proof is, of all others, the lea&s;t liable to be corrupted by fraud or mi&s;|repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>I may be allowed therefore, in the en|quiry which is now before us, to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome conclu&s;ions of this &s;ort, as preparatory to more direct te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our books relate, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the founder of the religion, was, in con&s;equence of his undertaking, put to death, as a male|factor, at Jeru&s;alem. This point at lea&s;t will be granted, becau&s;e it is no more than what Tacitus has recorded. They then proceed to tell us, that the religion was, <HI>not|with&s;tanding,</HI> &s;et forth at this &s;ame city of Jeru&s;alem, propagated from thence through|out Judea, and afterwards preached in other parts of the Roman cmpire. The&s;e points al&s;o
<PB N="58" REF="68">
are fully confirmed by Tacitus, who informs us that the religion, after a &s;hort check, broke out again in the country where it took its ri&s;e; that it not only &s;pread throughout Judea, but had reached Rome; and that it had there great multitudes of converts: and all this within thirty years after its com|mencement. Now the&s;e facts afford a &s;trong inference in behalf of the propo&s;ition which we maintain. What could the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t expect for them&s;elves, when they &s;aw their ma&s;ter put to death? Could they hope to e&s;cape the dangers, in which he had pe|ri&s;hed? If they have per&s;ecuted me, they will al&s;o per&s;ecute you, was the warning of common &s;en&s;e. With this example before their eyes, they could not be without a full &s;en&s;e of the peril of their future enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, all the hi&s;tories agree in re|pre&s;enting Chri&s;t as &s;oretelling the per&s;ecu|tion of his followers.</P>
<Q>"Then &s;hall they dellver you up to be afflicted, and &s;hall kill you, and ye &s;hall

<P><PB N="60" REF="70">
I am not entitled to argue from the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, that Chri&s;t actually did foretell the&s;e events, and that they did accordingly come to pa&s;s, becau&s;e that would be at once to a&s;|&s;ume the truth of the religion: but I am entitled to contend, that one &s;ide or other of the following disjunction is true; either that the evangeli&s;ts have delivered what Chri&s;t really &s;poke, and that the event cor|re&s;ponded with the prediction; or that they put the prediction into Chri&s;t's mouth, be|cau&s;e, at the time of writing the hi&s;tory, the event had turned out &s;o to be: for the only two remaining &s;uppo&s;itions appear in the highe&s;t degree incredible, which are, either that Chri&s;t &s;illed the minds of his fol|lowers with fears and apprehen&s;ions, with|out any rea&s;on or authority for what he &s;aid, and contrary to the truth of the ca&s;e; or that, although Chri&s;t had never foretold any &s;uch thing, and the event would have con|tradicted him if he had, yet hi&s;torians who lived in the age when the event was known, fal&s;ely as well as o&s;&s;iciou&s;ly, a&s;cribed the&s;e words to him.</P>

<P>THE account of the treatment of the reli|gion and of the exertions of its fir&s;t preach|ers, as &s;tated in our &s;criptures (not in a pro|fe&s;&s;ed hi&s;tory of per&s;ecutions, or in the con|nected manner in which I am about to re|cite it, but di&s;per&s;edly and occa&s;ionally, in the cour&s;e of a mixed, general, hi&s;tory, which circum&s;tance alone negatives the &s;uppo&s;ition of any fraudulent de&s;ign), is the following: "That the &s;ounder of Chri&s;tianity, &s;rom the commencement of his mini&s;try to the

reported what had pa&s;&s;ed to their companions; that this report, whil&s;t it apprized them of the danger of their &s;ituation and undertaking, had no other effect upon their conduct, than to produce in them a general re&s;olution to per&s;evere, and an earne&s;t prayer to God to furni&s;h them with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to in&s;pire them with fortitude, proportioned to the in|crea&s;ing exigency of the &s;ervice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iv.</NOTE>."

The mo&s;t tempting opportunity, which occurred, of making a gain of their converts, was by the cu&s;tody and management of the public funds, when &s;ome of the richer members, intending to contribute their fortunes to the common &s;upport of the &s;ociety, &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and laid down the prices at the apo&s;tles' feet.

Hitherto the preachers of the new reli|gion &s;eem to have had the common people on their &s;ide; which is a&s;&s;igned as the rea&s;on, why the Jewi&s;h rulers did not, at this time, think it prudent to proceed to greater ex|tremities.

<P>The death of this man was the &s;ignal of a general per&s;ecution, the activity of which may be judged of from one anecdote of the time: "As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every hou&s;e, and haling men and women, committed them to pri|&s;on." This per&s;ecution <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 3.</NOTE> raged at Jeru&s;alem

<P>An event now took place of great im|portance in the future hi&s;tory of the reli|gion. The <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts ix.</NOTE> per&s;ecution which had begun at Jeru&s;alem, followed the Chri&s;tians to other cities, in which the authority of the Jewi&s;h
<PB N="74" REF="84">
Sanhedrim over tho&s;e of their own nation was allowed to be exerci&s;ed. A young man, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his ho&s;tility to the profe&s;&s;ion, and had procured a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the council at Jeru&s;alem to &s;eize any converted Jews whom he might &s;ind at Dama&s;cus, &s;uddenly became a pro&s;elyte to the religion which he was going about to ex|tirpate. The new convert not only &s;hared, upon this extraordinary change, the &s;ate of his companions, but brought upon him&s;elf a double mea&s;ure of enmity from the party which he had left. The Jews at Dama&s;cus, upon his return to that city, watched the gates night and day with &s;o much diligence, that he e&s;caped from their hands only by being let down in a ba&s;ket by the wall. Nor did he &s;ind him&s;elf in greater &s;afety at Jeru&s;alem, whither he immediately repaired. Attempts were there al&s;o &s;oon &s;et on foot to de&s;troy him, &s;rom the danger of which he was pre&s;erved by being &s;ent away to Cilicia, his native country.</P>

This happened, at the mo&s;t only &s;even or eight, perhaps only three or four, years after Chri&s;t's death. Within which period, and notwith&s;tanding that the late per&s;ecution oc|cupied part of it, churches, or &s;ocieties of believers, had been formed in all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria; for we read that the churches in the&s;e countries "had <HI>now re&s;t,</HI> and were edi&s;ied, and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t, were multiplied <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 31.</NOTE>." The original preachers of the religion did not remit their
<PB N="76" REF="86">
labours or activity during this &s;ea&s;on of quietne&s;s; for we find one, and he a very principal per&s;on among&s;t them, pa&s;&s;ing throughout all quarters. We find al&s;o tho&s;e, who had been before cxpelled from Jeru|&s;alem by the per&s;ecution which raged there, travelling as far as Phoenice, Cyprus, and Antioch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts. xi. 19.</NOTE>; and la&s;tly, we find Jeru&s;alem again the centre of the mi&s;&s;ion, the place whither the preachers returned from their &s;everal excur&s;ions, where they reported the conduct and effects of their mini&s;try, where que&s;tions of public concern were canva&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled, from whence directions were &s;ought, and teachers &s;ent forth.</P>
<P>The time of this tranquillity did not, how|ever, continue long. Herod Agrippa, who had lately acceded to the government of Judea, "&s;tretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 1.</NOTE>." He began his cruelty by beheading one of the twelve ori|ginal apo&s;tles, a kin&s;man and con&s;tant companion
<PB N="77" REF="87">
of the founder of the religion. Per|ceiving that this execution gratified the Jews, he proceeded to &s;eize, in order to put to death, another of the number; and him, like the former, a&s;&s;ociated with Chri&s;t' during his life, and eminently active in the &s;ervice &s;ince his death. This man was, however, deli|vered from pri&s;on, as the account &s;tates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 3&mdash;17.</NOTE>, miraculou&s;ly, and made his e&s;cape from Jeru|&s;alem.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are related, not in the gene|ral terms under which, in giving the outlines of the hi&s;tory, we have here mentioned them, but with the utmo&s;t particularity of names, per&s;ons, places, and circum&s;tances; and, what is de&s;erving of notice, without the &s;malle&s;t di&s;coverable propen&s;ity in the hi&s;|torian to magnify the fortitude, or exaggerate the &s;ufferings, of his party. When they fled for their lives, he tells us. When the churches had re&s;t, he remarks it. When the people took their part, he does not leave
<PB N="78" REF="88">
it without notice. When the apo&s;tles were carried a &s;econd time before the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nhedrim, he is careful to ob&s;erve that they were brought without violence. When milder councils were &s;ugge&s;ted, he gives us the au|thor of the advice, and the &s;peech which contained it. When, in con&s;equence of this advice, the rulers contented them&s;elves with threatening the apo&s;tles, and commanding them to be beaten with &s;tripes, without urg|ing at that time the per&s;ecution farther, the hi&s;torian candidly and di&s;tinctly records their forbearance. When, therefore, in other in&s;tances, he &s;tates heavier per&s;ecutions, or actual martyrdoms, it is rea&s;onable to be|lieve that he &s;tates them becau&s;e they were true; and not from any wi&s;h to aggravate, in his account, the &s;ufferings which Chri&s;|tians &s;u&s;tained, or to extol, more than it de|&s;erved, their patience under them.</P>
<P>Our hi&s;tory now pur&s;ues a narrower path. Leaving the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, and the original a&s;&s;ociates of Chri&s;t, engaged in the propagation of the new faith (and who, there is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to believe, abated in
<PB N="79" REF="89">
their diligence or courage), the narrative proceeds with the &s;eparate memoirs of that eminent teacher, who&s;e extraordinary and &s;udden conver&s;ion to the religion, and cor|re&s;ponding change of conduct, had before been circum&s;tantially de&s;cribed. This per&s;on, in conjunction with another, who appeared among&s;t the earlie&s;t members of the &s;ociety at Jeru&s;alem, and among&s;t the immediate adherents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 36.</NOTE> of the twelve apo&s;tles, &s;et out from Antioch upon the expre&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s of carrying the new religion through the vari|ous provinces of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 2.</NOTE>. During this expedition we find, that, in almo&s;t every place to which they came, their per&s;ons were in&s;ulted, and their lives endangered. After being expelled from Antioch in Pi&s;idia, they repaired to leonium <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 50.</NOTE>. At Iconium an at|tempt was made to &s;tone them. At Ly&s;tra, whither they fled from Iconium, one of them actually was &s;toned, and drawn out of the city for dead <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv. 5.</NOTE>. The&s;e two men, though not them&s;elves original apo&s;tles, were acting
<PB N="80" REF="90">
in connection and conjunction with the ori|ginal apo&s;tles; for, after the completion of their journey, being &s;ent upon a particular commi&s;&s;ion to Jeru&s;alem, they there related to the apo&s;tles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 12&mdash;26.</NOTE> and elders the events and &s;ucce&s;s of their mini&s;try, and were, in return, recommended by them to the churches, "as men who had hazarded their lives in the cau&s;e."</P>
<P>The treatment which they had experien|ced in their fir&s;t progre&s;s did not deter them from preparing for a &s;econd. Upon a di&s;|pute, however, ari&s;ing between them, but not connected with the common &s;ubject of their labours, they acted as wi&s;e and &s;incere men would act; they did not retire in di&s;|gu&s;t from the &s;ervice in which they were engaged, but, each devoting his endeavours to the advancement of the religion, they parted from one another, and &s;et forwards upon &s;eparate routes. The hi&s;tory goes along with one of them; and the &s;econd enterpri&s;e to him was attended with the
<PB N="81" REF="91">
&s;ame dangers and per&s;ecutions as both had met with in the fir&s;t. The apo&s;tle's travels hitherto had been con&s;ined to A&s;ia. He now cro&s;&s;es, for the fir&s;t time, the Aegean Sea, and carries with him, among&s;t others, the per&s;on who&s;e accounts &s;upply the infor|mation we are &s;tating <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 11.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t place in Greece at which he appears to have &s;topped was Philippi in Macedonia. Here him&s;elf and one of his companions were cruelly whipped, ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and kept there under the mo&s;t rigorous cu&s;tody, being thru&s;t, whil&s;t yet &s;marting with their wounds, into the inner dungeon, and their fe&s;t made fa&s;t in the &s;tocks <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 23, 24. 33.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding this unequivocal &s;pecimen of the u&s;age which they had to look for in that country, they went forward in the execution of their er|rand. After pa&s;&s;ing through Amphipolis and Appollonia, they came to The&s;&s;alonica; in which city the hou&s;e in which they lodged was a&s;&s;ailed by a party of their ene|mies, in order to bring them out to the

And when, fortunately for their pre&s;ervation, they were not found at home, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was dragged before the magi&s;trate for admitting them within his doors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 1&mdash;5.</NOTE>. Their reception at the next city was &s;omething better: but neither here had they continued long before their turbu|lent adver&s;aries, the Jews, excited again&s;t them &s;uch commotions among&s;t the inha|bitants, as obliged the apo&s;tle to make his e&s;cape by a private journey to Athens <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 13.</NOTE>. The extremity of the progre&s;s was Corinth. His abode in this city, for &s;ome time, &s;eems to have been without mole&s;tation. At length, however, the Jews found means to &s;tir up an in&s;urrection again&s;t him, and to bring him before the tribunal of the Roman pre&s;ident <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 12.</NOTE>. It was to the contempt which that magi&s;trate entertained for the Jews and their controver&s;ies, of which he accounted Chri&s;tianity to be one, that our apo&s;tle owed his deliverance <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">V. 18.</NOTE>.</P>

This indefatigable teacher, after leaving Corinth, returned by Ephe&s;us into Syria; and again vi&s;ited Jeru&s;alem, and the &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians in that city, which, as hath been repeatedly ob&s;erved, &s;till continued the cen|ter of the mi&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 22.</NOTE>. It &s;uited not, however, with the activity of his zeal to remain long at Jeru&s;alem.

This progre&s;s ended at Ephe&s;us; in which city the apo&s;tle continued in the daily exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try two years, and until his &s;ucce&s;s, at length, excited the apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e who were inter|e&s;ted in the &s;upport of the national wor&s;hip.

He had been only a few days in that city when the populace, in&s;tigated by &s;ome of his old opponents in A&s;ia, who attended this fea&s;t, &s;eized him in the temple, forced him out of it, and were ready immediately to have de|&s;troyed him, had not the &s;udden pre&s;ence of the Roman guard re&s;cued him out of their hands <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxi. 27&mdash;33.</NOTE>. The officer, however, who had thus &s;ea&s;onably interpo&s;ed, acted from his

care of the public peace, with the pre&s;erva|tion of which he was charged, and not from any favour to the apo&s;tle, or indeed any di&s;|po&s;ition to exerci&s;e either ju&s;tice or humanity towards him; for he had no &s;ooner &s;ecured his per&s;on in the fortre&s;s, than he was pro|ceeding to examine him by torture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 12. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this time to the conclu&s;ion of the hi&s;|tory, the apo&s;tle remains in public cu&s;tody of the Roman government. After e&s;caping a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination by a fortunate di&s;covery of the plot, and delivering him&s;elf from the influ|ence of his enemies by an appeal to the au|dience of the emperor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxv. 9. 11.</NOTE>, he was &s;ent, but not until he had &s;uffered two years impri&s;on|ment, to Rome <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 27.</NOTE>. He reached Italy after a tedious voyage, and after encountering in his pa&s;&s;age the perils of a de&s;perate &s;hip|wreck <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii.</NOTE>. But although &s;till a pri&s;oner, and his fate &s;till depending, neither the various and long-continued &s;ufferings which he had
<PB N="86" REF="96">
undergone, nor the danger of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, deterred him from per&s;i&s;ting in preaching the religion; for the hi&s;torian clo&s;es the account by telling us, that, for two years, he received all that came unto him in his own hired hou&s;e, where he was permitted to dwell with a &s;oldier that guard|ed him, "preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching tho&s;e things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t with all confidence."</P>
<P>Now the hi&s;torian, from whom we have drawn this account, in the part of his nar|rative which relates to St. Paul, is &s;upported by the &s;tronge&s;t corroborating te&s;timony that a hi&s;tory can receive. We are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of letters written by St. Paul him&s;elf upon the &s;ubject of his mini&s;try, and either writ|ten during the period which the hi&s;tory com|pri&s;es, or, if written afterwards, reciting and referring to the tran&s;actions of that period. The&s;e letters, without borrowing from the hi&s;tory, or the hi&s;tory from them, uninten|tionally confirm the account which the hi&s;|tory delivers in a great variety of particulars.

What belongs to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e is the de&s;cription exhibited of the apo&s;tle's &s;uffer|ings: and the repre&s;entation, given in the hi&s;tory, of the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which he underwent, not only agrees, in general, with the language which he him&s;elf u&s;es, whenever he &s;peaks of his life or mini&s;try, but is al&s;o, in many in&s;tances, atte&s;ted by a &s;pecific cor|re&s;pondency of time, place, and order of events. If the hi&s;torian puts down in his narrative that at Philippi the apo&s;tle "was beaten with many &s;tripes, ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and there treated with rigour and indignity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 24.</NOTE>," we find him, in a letter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. ii. 2.</NOTE> to a neighbouring church, reminding his converts, that, "after he had &s;uffered before, and was &s;hamefully intreated at Philippi, he was bold, neverthe|le&s;s, to &s;peak unto them (to who&s;e city he next came) the Go&s;pel of God."

the magi&s;trate for admitting &s;uch a gue&s;t within his doors, the apo&s;tle, in his letters to the Chri&s;tians of The&s;&s;alonica, calls to their remembrance "how they had received the Go&s;pel in much affliction." If the hi&s;tory deliver an account of an in&s;urrection at Ephe&s;us, which had nearly co&s;t the apo&s;tle his l fe, we have the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, in a letter written a &s;hort time after his depar|ture from that city, de&s;cribing his de&s;pair, and returning thanks for his deliverance <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Acts xix.</P> <P>2 Cor. i. 8, 9.</P></NOTE>. If the hi&s;tory inform us, that the apo&s;tle was expelled from Antioch in Pi&s;idia, attempted to be &s;toned at Iconium, and actually &s;toned at Ly&s;tra, there is pre&s;erved a letter from him to a favorite convert, whom, as the &s;ame hi&s;|tory tells us, he fir&s;t met with in the&s;e parts; in which letter he appeals to that di&s;ciple's knowledge "of the per&s;ecutions which befell him at Antioch, at Iconium, at Ly&s;tra <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Acts xiii. 50. xix. 5. 19.</P>

<P>The&s;e coincidences, together with many relative to other parts of the apo&s;tle's hi&s;tory, and <HI>all</HI> drawn from independent &s;ources, not only confirm the truth of the account, in the particular points as to which they are ob&s;erved, but add much to the credit of the narrative in all its parts; and &s;upport the author's profe&s;&s;ion of being a contemporary of the per&s;on who&s;e hi&s;tory he writes, and, throughout a material portion of his narra|tive, a companion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">There is &s;atisfactory evidence, that many, pro|fe&s;&s;ing to have been original witne&s;&s;es of the Chri&s;tian miracles, pa&s;&s;ed their lives in labours, dangers, and &s;ufferings, voluntarily undergone in atte&s;tation of the accounts which they delivered, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of tho&s;e accounts; and that they al&s;o &s;ubmitted, from the &s;ame motives, to new rules of conduct.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the hi&s;tory, of which the la&s;t chap|ter contains an ab&s;tract, there are a few ob|&s;ervations which it may be proper to make, by way of applying its te&s;timony to the par|ticular propo&s;itions for which we contend.</P>
<P N="1">I. Although our &s;cripture hi&s;tory leaves the general account of the apo&s;tles in an early part of the narrative, and proceeds with the &s;eparate account of one particular
<PB N="96" REF="106">
apo&s;tle, yet the information which it delivers &s;o far extends to the re&s;t, as it &s;hews <HI>the na|ture of the &s;ervice.</HI> When we &s;ee one apo&s;tle &s;uffering per&s;ecution in the di&s;charge of his commi&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall not believe, without evidence, that the &s;ame office could, at the &s;ame time, be attended with ea&s;e and &s;afety to others. And this fair and rea&s;onable infer|ence is confirmed by the direct atte&s;tation of the letters, to which we have &s;o often refer|red. The writer of the&s;e letters not only alludes, in numerous pa&s;&s;ages, to his own &s;ufferings, but &s;peaks of the re&s;t of the apo|&s;tles as enduring like &s;ufferings with him&s;elf. "I think that God hath &s;et forth <HI>us the apo|&s;tles</HI> la&s;t, as it were, appointed to death; for we are made a &s;pectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men&mdash;even unto this pre|&s;ent hour, we both hunger and thir&s;t, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; and labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we ble&s;s; being per&s;ecuted, we &s;uffer it; being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things
<PB N="97" REF="107">
unto this day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. et &s;eq.</NOTE>." Add to which, that in the &s;hort account that is given of the other apo&s;tles, in the former part of the hi&s;tory, and within the &s;hort period which that ac|count compri&s;es, we find, fir&s;t, two of them &s;eized, impri&s;oned, brought before the San|hedrim, and threatened with further puni&s;h|ment <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 3. 21.</NOTE>; then, the whole number impri&s;on|ed and beaten <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 18. 40.</NOTE>: &s;oon afterwards, one of their adherents &s;toned to death, and &s;o hot a per&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t the &s;ect, as to drive mo&s;t of them out of the place; a &s;hort time only &s;ucceeding, before one of the twelve was beheaded, and another &s;entenced to the &s;ame fate; and all this pa&s;&s;ing in the &s;ingle city of Jeru&s;alem, and within ten years after the founder's death, and the commence|ment of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly; We take no credit at pre|&s;ent for the miraculous part of the narrative, nor do we in&s;i&s;t upon the correctne&s;s of &s;in|gle pa&s;&s;ages of it. If the whole &s;tory be not a novel, a romance; the whole action a dream; if Peter, and James and Paul, and
<PB N="98" REF="108">
the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, mentioned in the ac|count, be not all imaginary per&s;ons; if their letters be not all forgeries, and, what is more, forgeries of names and characters which never exi&s;ted; then is there evi|dence in our hands &s;ufficient to &s;upport the only fact we contend for (and which, I repeat again, is, in it&s;elf, highly probable), that the original followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t exerted great endeavours to propagate his religion, and underwent great labours, dan|gers, and &s;ufferings, in con&s;equence of their undertaking.</P>
<P N="3">III. The general reality of the apo&s;tolic hi&s;tory is &s;trongly confirmed by the con&s;i|deration, that it, in truth, does no more than a&s;&s;ign adequate cau&s;es for effects which cer|tainly were produced, and de&s;cribe con&s;e|quences naturally re&s;ulting from &s;ituations which certainly exi&s;ted. The <HI>effects</HI> were certainly there, of which this hi&s;tory &s;ets forth the cau&s;e, and origin, and progre&s;s. It is acknowledged on all hands, becau&s;e it is recorded by other te&s;timony than that of the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves, that the religion
<PB N="99" REF="109">
began to prevail at that time, and in that country. It is very difficult to conceive how it could begin, or prevail at all, with|out the exertions of the founder and his followers in propagating the new per&s;ua|&s;ion. The hi&s;tory now in our hands de&s;cribes the&s;e exertions, the per&s;ons em|ployed, the means and endeavours made u&s;e of, and the labours undertaken in the pro&s;ecution of this purpo&s;e. Again, the treatment which the hi&s;tory repre&s;ents the fir&s;t propagators of the religion to have experienced, was no other than what natu|rally re&s;ulted from the &s;ituation in which they were confe&s;&s;edly placed. It is admit|ted that the religion was adver&s;e, in a great degree, to the reigning opinions, and to the hopes and wi&s;hes of the nation to which it was fir&s;t introduced; and that it overthrew, &s;o far as it was received, the e&s;tabli&s;hed theo|logy and wor&s;hip of every other country. We cannot feel much reluctance in believing that, when the me&s;&s;engers of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem went about not only publi&s;hing their opini|ons, but collecting pro&s;elytes, and forming
<PB N="100" REF="110">
regular &s;ocieties of pro&s;elytes, they &s;hould meet with oppo&s;ition in their attempts, or that this oppo&s;ition &s;hould &s;ometimes pro|ceed to fatal extremities. Our hi&s;tory de|tails examples of this oppo&s;ition, and of the &s;ufferings and dangers which the emi&s;&s;aries of the religion underwent, perfectly agree|able to what might rea&s;onably be expected, from the nature of their undertaking, com|pared with the character of the age and country in which it was carried on.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fourthly; The records before us &s;upply evidence of what formed another member of our general propo&s;ition, and what, as hath already been ob&s;erved, is highly probable, and almo&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of their new profe&s;&s;ion, viz. that, together with activity and courage in propa|gating the religion, the primitive followers of Je&s;us a&s;&s;umed, upon their conver&s;ion, a new and peculiar cour&s;e of private life. Im|mediately after their ma&s;ter was withdrawn from them, we hear of their "continuing with one accord in prayer and &s;upplication
<PB N="101" REF="111">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 14.</NOTE>," of their "continuing daily with one accord in the temple <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 46.</NOTE>," of "many being gathered together praying <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 12.</NOTE>." We know what &s;trict injunctions were laid upon the converts by their teachers. Wherever they came, the fir&s;t word of their preaching was, "Repent!" We know that the&s;e injunctions obliged them to refrain from many &s;pecies of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which were not, at that time, reputed criminal. We know the rules of purity, and the maxims of benevolence, which Chri&s;tians read in their books; con|cerning which rules, it is enough to ob&s;erve, that, if they were, I will not &s;ay, completely obeyed, but in any degree regarded, they would produce a &s;y&s;tem of conduct, and, what is more difficult to pre&s;erve, a di&s;po&s;i|tion of mind, and a regulation of affections, different from any thing to which they had hitherto been accu&s;tomed, and different from what they would &s;ee in others. The change and di&s;tinction of manners, which re&s;ulted
<PB N="102" REF="112">
from their new character, is perpetually re|ferred to in the letters of their teachers. "And you hath he quickened, who <HI>were</HI> dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, wherein in <HI>times pa&s;t</HI> ye walked, according to the cour&s;e of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the &s;pirit that now work|eth in the children of di&s;obedience; among whom al&s;o we had our conver&s;ation in times pa&s;t, in the lu&s;ts of our fle&s;h, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h, and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 1&mdash;3. &s;ee al&s;o Tit. iii. 3.</NOTE>."&mdash;"For the <HI>time pa&s;t of our life</HI> may &s;uffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in la&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s, lu&s;t, exce&s;s of wine, revellings, banquet|ings, and abominable idolatries, <HI>wherein they think it &s;trange that ye run not with them to the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 3, 4.</NOTE>." St. Paul, in his fir&s;t letter to the Corinthians, after enume|rating, as his manner was, a catalogue of vi|cious characters, adds, "Such <HI>were</HI> &s;ome
<PB N="103" REF="113">
of you, but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;ancti|fied <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi 11.</NOTE>." In like manner, and alluding to the &s;ame change of practices and &s;entiment, he a&s;ks the Roman Chri&s;tians "what fruit they had in tho&s;e things whereof they are <HI>now</HI> a&s;hamed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 21.</NOTE>?" The phra&s;es which the &s;ame writer employs to de&s;cribe the moral condition of Chri&s;tians, compared with their condition before they became Chri&s;tians, &s;uch as "newne&s;s of life," being "freed from &s;in," being "dead to &s;in;" "the de|&s;truction of the body of &s;in, that, <HI>for the fu|ture,</HI> they &s;hould not &s;erve &s;in;" "children of light and of the day," as oppo&s;ed to "chil|dren of darkne&s;s and of the night," "not &s;leeping as others," imply, at lea&s;t, a new &s;y&s;tem of obligation, and, probably, a new &s;eries of conduct, commencing with their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony which Pliny bears to the behaviour of the new &s;ect in his time, and
<PB N="104" REF="114">
which te&s;timony comes not more than fifty years after that of St. Paul, is very applicable to the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration. The character which this writer gives of the Chri&s;tians of that age, and which was drawn from a pretty accurate enquiry, becau&s;e he con&s;idered their moral principles as the point in which the magi&s;trate was intere&s;ted, is as follows:&mdash;He tells the emperor, "that &s;ome of tho&s;e who had relinqui&s;hed the &s;ociety, or who, to &s;ave them&s;elves, pretended that they had relinqui&s;hed it, affirmed that they were wont to meet together, on a &s;tated day, before it was light, and &s;ung among them|&s;elves alternately a hymn to Chri&s;t as a God; and to bind them&s;elves, by an oath, not to the commi&s;&s;ion of any wickedne&s;s, but that they would not be guilty of theft or robbery, or adultery; that they would never fal&s;ify their word, nor deny a pledge committed to them, when called upon to return it." This proves that a morality, more pure and &s;trict than was ordinary, pre|vailed at that time in Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties.
<PB N="105" REF="115">
And to me it appears, that we are authori&s;ed to carry this te&s;timony back to the age of the apo&s;tles; becau&s;e it is not probable that the immediate hearers and di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t were more relaxed than their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in Pliny's time, or the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the reli|gion than tho&s;e whom they taught.</P>

doubt remain upon our minds, but that a number of per&s;ons at that time appeared in the world, publicly advancing an extraor|dinary &s;tory, and, for the &s;ake of propagat|ing the belief of that &s;tory, voluntarily in|curring great per&s;onal dangers, traver&s;ing &s;eas and kingdoms, exerting great indu&s;try, and &s;u&s;taining great extremities of ill u&s;age and per&s;ecution. It is al&s;o proved that the &s;ame per&s;ons, in con&s;equence of their per|&s;ua&s;ion, or pretended per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of what they a&s;&s;erted, entered upon a cour&s;e of life in many re&s;pects new and &s;ingular.</P>
<P>From the clear and acknowledged parts of the ca&s;e, I think it to be likewi&s;e in the highe&s;t degree probable, that the &s;tory, for which the&s;e per&s;ons voluntarily expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the fatigues and hard&s;hips which they endured, was a <HI>miraculous</HI> &s;tory; I mean, that they pretended to miraculous evidence of &s;ome kind or other. They had nothing el&s;e to &s;tand upon. The de&s;ignation of the per&s;on, that is to &s;ay, that Je&s;us of Nazareth, rather than any other per&s;on, was
<PB N="109" REF="119">
the Me&s;&s;iah, and, as &s;uch, the &s;ubject of their mini&s;try, could only be founded upon &s;uper|natural tokens attributed to him. Here were no victories, no conque&s;ts, no revolu|tions, no &s;urpri&s;ing elevation of fortune, no achievements of valour, of &s;trength, or of policy, to appeal to; no di&s;coveries in any art or &s;cience, no great efforts of genius or learning to produce. A Galilean pea&s;ant was announced to the world as a divine law|giver. A young man of mean condition, of a private and &s;imple life, and who had wrought no deliverance for the Jewi&s;h na|tion, was declared to be their Me&s;&s;iah. This, without a&s;cribing to him at the &s;ame time &s;ome proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion, (and what other but &s;upernatural proofs could there be?) was too ab&s;urd a claim to be either imagined, or attempted, or credited. In whatever degree, or in whatever part, the religion was <HI>argu|mentative,</HI> when it came to the que&s;tion, "is the carpenter's &s;on of Nazareth the per&s;on whom we are to receive and obey?" there was nothing but the miracles attributed to him, by which his preten&s;ions could be
<PB N="110" REF="120">
maintained for a moment. Every contro|ver&s;y and every que&s;tion mu&s;t pre&s;uppo&s;e the&s;e; for, however &s;uch controver&s;ies, when they did ari&s;e, might, and naturally would, be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed upon their own grounds of ar|gumentation, without citing the miraculous evidence which had been a&s;&s;erted to attend the founder of the religion (which would have been to enter upon another, and a more general, que&s;tion), yet we are to bear in mind, that, without previou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence or the pretence of &s;uch evi|dence, there could have been no place for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or the argument at all. Thus, for example, whether the prophecies, which the Jews interpreted to belong to the Me&s;|&s;iah, were, or were not, applicable to the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us of Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">areth, was a natural &s;ubject of debate in tho&s;e times: and the de|bate would proceed, without recurring at every turn to his miracles, becau&s;e it &s;et out with &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e; ina&s;much as without miraculous marks and tokens (real or pre|tended), or without &s;ome &s;uch great change effected by his means in the public condition
<PB N="111" REF="121">
of the country, as might have &s;atisfied the then received interpretation of the&s;e pro|phecies, I do not &s;ee how the que&s;tion could ever have been entertained. Apollos, we read, "mightily convinced the Jews, &s;how|ing by the &s;criptures that Je&s;us was Chri&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 28.</NOTE>;" but unle&s;s Je&s;us had exhibited &s;ome di&s;tinc|tion of his per&s;on, &s;ome proof of &s;uperna|tural power, the argument from the old &s;crip|tures could have had no place. It had no|thing to attach upon. A young man, calling him&s;elf the Son of God, gathering a crowd about him, and delivering to them lectures of morality, could not have excited &s;o much as a doubt among&s;t the Jews whether he was the object in whom a long &s;eries of ancient prophecies terminated, from the completion of which they had formed &s;uch magnificent expectations, and expectations of a nature &s;o oppo&s;ite to what appeared: I mean, no &s;uch doubt could exi&s;t when they had the whole ca&s;e before them, when they &s;aw him put to death for his officiou&s;ne&s;s, and when by
<PB N="112" REF="122">
his death the evidence concerning him was clo&s;ed. Again, the <HI>effect</HI> of the Me&s;&s;iah's coming, &s;uppo&s;ing Je&s;us to have been him, upon Jews, upon Gentiles, upon their rela|tion to each other, upon their acceptance with God, upon their duties and their ex|pectations; his nature, authority, office, and agency; were likely to become &s;ubjects of much con&s;ideration with the early votaries of the religion, and to occupy their attention and writings. I &s;hould not, however, expect, that in the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions, whether pre&s;erved in the form of letters, &s;peeches, or &s;et trea|ti&s;es, frequent or very direct mention of his miracles would occur. Still miraculous evi|dence lay at the bottom of the argument. In the <HI>primary</HI> que&s;tion, miraculous preten|&s;ions, and miraculous preten&s;ions alone, were what they had to rely upon.</P>
<P>That the original &s;tory was miraculous, is very fairly al&s;o inferred from the miracu|lous powers which were laid claim to by the Chri&s;tians of &s;ucceeding ages. If the ac|counts of the&s;e miracles be true, it was a
<PB N="113" REF="123">
continuation of the &s;ame powers; if they be fal&s;e, it was an <HI>imitation,</HI> I will not &s;ay, of what had been wrought, but of what had been reported to have been wrought, by tho&s;e who preceded them. That imitation &s;hould follow reality; fiction be grafted upon truth; that if miracles were performed at fir&s;t, miracles &s;hould be pretended after|wards, agrees &s;o well with the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, that we can have no great difficulty in believing it. The con|trary &s;uppo&s;ition is very improbable, namely, that miracles &s;hould be pretended to by the followers of the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t emi&s;&s;aries of the religion, when none were pretended to, either in their own per&s;ons or that of their ma&s;ter, by the&s;e apo&s;tles and emi&s;&s;aries them|&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">There is &s;atisfactory evidence, that many, pro|fe&s;&s;ing to have been original witne&s;&s;es of the Chri&s;tian miracles, pa&s;&s;ed their lives in labours, dangers, and &s;ufferings, voluntarily undergone in atte&s;tation of the accounts which they delivered, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of tho&s;e accounts; and that they al&s;o &s;ubmitted, from the &s;ame motives, to new rules of conduct.</HEAD>
<P>IT once then being proved, that the fir&s;t propagators of the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution did exert great activity, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to great dangers and &s;ufferings, in con&s;e|quence, and for the &s;ake of an extraordinary, and I think we may &s;ay, of a miraculous &s;tory of &s;ome kind or other; the next great que&s;tion is, Whether the account, which our &s;criptures contain, be that &s;tory; that which the&s;e men delivered, and for which they acted and &s;uffered as they did?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125">
This que&s;tion is, in effect, no other than, whether the &s;tory which Chri&s;tians have <HI>now,</HI> be the &s;tory which Chri&s;tians had <HI>then?</HI> and of this the following proofs may be deduced from general con&s;iderations, and from con&s;iderations prior to any enquiry into the particular rea&s;ons and te&s;timonies by which the authority of our hi&s;tories is &s;upported.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there exi&s;ts no trace or ve&s;tige of any other &s;tory. It is not, like the death of Cyrus the Great, a competition between oppo&s;ite accounts, or between the credit of different hi&s;torians. There is not a document, or &s;crap of account, either con|temporary with the commencement of Chri&s;|tianity, or extant within many ages after that commencement, which a&s;&s;igns a hi&s;tory &s;ub|&s;tantially different from ours. The remote, brief, and incidental notices of the affair, which are found in heathen writers, &s;o far as they do go, go along with us. They bear te&s;timony to the&s;e facts; that the in|&s;titution originated from Je&s;us; that the
<PB N="116" REF="126">
founder was put to death, as a malefactor, at Jeru&s;alem, by the authority of the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate; that the religion neverthele&s;s &s;pread in that city, and through|out Judea; and that it was propagated from thence to di&s;tant countries; that the con|verts were numerous; that they &s;uffered great hard&s;hips and injuries for their pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and that all this took place in the age of the world which our books have a&s;&s;igned. They go on further, to de&s;cribe the <HI>manners</HI> of Chri&s;tians in terms perfectly conformable to the accounts extant in our books; that they were wont to a&s;&s;emble on a certain day; that they &s;ung hymns to Chri&s;t as to a god; that they bound them&s;elves by an oath not to commit any crime, but to ab|&s;tain from theft and adultery, to adhere &s;trict|ly to their promi&s;es, and not to deny money depo&s;ited in their hands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Pliny's Letter. Bonnet, in his lively way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, &s;ays&mdash;"Comparing Pliny's Letter with the account in the Acts, it &s;eems to me that I had not taken up another author, but that I was &s;till read|ing the hi&s;torian of that extraordinary &s;ociety."

of &s;uch an account upon the face of it, becau&s;e it de&s;cribes effects, namely, the ap|pearance in the world of a new religion, and the conver&s;ion of great multitudes to it, without de&s;cending, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, to the detail of the tran&s;action upon which it was founded, the interior of the in&s;titu|tion, the evidence or arguments offered by tho&s;e who drew over others to it. Yet &s;till here is no contradiction of our &s;tory; no other or different &s;tory &s;et up again&s;t it; but &s;o far a confirmation of it, as that, in the general points upon which the heathen ac|count touches, it agrees with that which we find in our own books.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the very few Jewi&s;h writers, of that and the adjoin|ing period, which have come down to us. Whatever they omit, or whatever difficulties we may find in explaining the omi&s;&s;ion, they advance no other hi&s;tory of the tran&s;|action than that which we acknowledge. Jo&s;ephus, who wrote his antiquities, or hi&s;|tory of the Jews, about &s;ixty years after the
<PB N="119" REF="129">
commencement of Chri&s;tianity, in a pa&s;&s;age generally admitted as genuine, makes men|tion of John under the name of John the Bapti&s;t; that he was a preacher of virtue; that he baptized his pro&s;elytes; that he was well received by the people; that he was impri&s;oned and put to death by Herod; and that Herod lived in a criminal cohabitation with Herodias, his brother's wife <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. xviii. cap. v. &s;ect. 1, 2.</NOTE>. In an|other pa&s;&s;age, allowed by many, although not without con&s;iderable que&s;tion being moved about it, we hear of "James, the brother of him who was called Je&s;us, and of his being put to death <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. xx. cap. ix. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>." In a third pa&s;|&s;age, extant in every copy that remains of Jo&s;ephus's hi&s;tory, but the authenticity of which has neverthele&s;s been long di&s;puted, we have an explicit te&s;timony to the &s;ub|&s;tance of our hi&s;tory in the&s;e words:&mdash;"At that time lived Je&s;us, a wi&s;e man, if he may be called a man, for he performed many wonderful works. He was a teacher of &s;uch
<PB N="120" REF="130">
men as received the truth with plea&s;ure. He drew over to him many Jews and Gen|tiles. This was the Chri&s;t; and when Pi|late, at the in&s;tigation of the chief men among us, had condemned him to the cro&s;s, they, who before had conceived an affection for him, did not cea&s;e to adhere to him; for on the third day he appeared to them alive again, the divine prophets having foretold the&s;e and many wonderful things concern|ing him.

Whatever become of the controver&s;y con|cerning the genuinene&s;s of this pa&s;&s;age; whether Jo&s;ephus go the whole length of our hi&s;tory, which, if the pa&s;&s;age be &s;incere, he does; or whether he proceed only a very little way with us, which, if the pa&s;&s;age be rejected, we confe&s;s to be the ca&s;e; &s;till what we a&s;&s;erted is true, that he gives no other or different hi&s;tory of the &s;ubject from ours, no other or different account of the origin of the in&s;titution. And I think al&s;o
<PB N="121" REF="131">
that it may with great rea&s;on be contended, either that the pa&s;&s;age is genuine, or that the &s;ilence of Jo&s;ephus was <HI>de&s;igned.</HI> For, al|though we &s;hould lay a&s;ide the authority of our own books entirely, yet when Tacitus, who wrote not twenty, perhaps not ten, years after Jo&s;ephus, in his account of a pe|riod in which Jo&s;ephus was near thirty years of age, tells us, that a va&s;t multitude of Chri&s;tians were condemned at Rome; that they derived their denomination from Chri&s;t, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was put to death, as a criminal, by the procurator Pon|tius Pilate; that the &s;uper&s;tition had &s;pread not only over Judea, the &s;ource of the evil, but had reached Rome al&s;o: &mdash; when Sueto|nius, an hi&s;torian contemporary with Tacitus, relates, that, in the time of Claudius, the Jews were making di&s;turbances at Rome, Chre&s;tus being their leader; and that, dur|ing the reign of Nero, the Chri&s;tians were puni&s;hed; under both which emperors Jo|&s;ephus lived:&mdash;when Pliny, who wrote his celebrated epi&s;tle not more than thirty years after the publication of Jo&s;ephus's
<PB N="122" REF="132">
hi&s;tory, found the Chri&s;tians in &s;uch numbers in the province of Bithynia as to draw from him a complaint, that the contagion had &s;eized cities, towns, and villages, and had &s;o &s;eized them as to produce a general de&s;er|tion of the public rites; and when, as hath already been ob&s;erved, there is no rea&s;on for imagining that the Chri&s;tians were more numerous in Bithynia than in many other parts of the Roman empire: it cannot, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, after this, be believed, that the religion, and the tran&s;action upon which it was founded, were too ob&s;cure to engage the attention of Jo&s;ephus, or to obtain a place in his hi&s;tory. Perhaps he did not know how to repre&s;ent the bu&s;ine&s;s, and di&s;po&s;ed of his difficulties by pa&s;&s;ing it over in &s;ilence. Eu&s;ebius wrote the life of Con|&s;tantine, yet omits entirely the mo&s;t remark|able circum&s;tance in that life, the death of his &s;on Cri&s;pus; undoubtedly for the rea&s;on here given. The re&s;erve of Jo&s;ephus upon the &s;ubject of Chri&s;tianity appears al&s;o in his pa&s;&s;ing over the bani&s;hment of the Jews by Claudius, which Suetonius, we have &s;een,
<PB N="123" REF="133">
has recorded with an expre&s;s reference to Chri&s;t.

<P>In an epi&s;tle of Clement, a hearer of St. Paul, although written for a purpo&s;e re|motely connected with the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, we have the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and the &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tles, recorded in the&s;e &s;atisfactory terms: "The apo&s;tles have preached to us from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t from God&mdash;For having received their command, and being <HI>thoroughly a&s;&s;ured by the re&s;urrection of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they went abroad, publi&s;hing that the kingdom of God was at hand <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ep.

<P>In an epi&s;tle of Polycarp, a di&s;ciple of St. John, though only a brief hortatory letter, we have the humility, patience, &s;ufferings, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, toge|ther with the apo&s;tolic character of St. Paul, di&s;tinctly recognized <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pol.

The de&s;cent of Chri&s;t from David, his mo|ther Mary, his miraculous conception, the &s;tar at his birth, his bapti&s;m by John, the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it, his appeal to the pro|phets, the ointment poured on his head, his &s;ufferings under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, his re&s;urrection, the Lord's day called and kept in commemoration of it, and the Euchari&s;t, in both its parts, are une|quivocally referred to. Upon the re&s;urrec|tion this writer is even circum&s;tantial.

Quadratus, of the &s;ame age with Ignatius, has left us the following noble te&s;timony:&mdash;"The works of our Saviour were always con&s;picuous, for they were real: both they that were healed, and they that were rai&s;ed from the dead: who were &s;een not only when they were healed or rai&s;ed, but for a long time afterwards.

<P>Ju&s;tin Martyr came little more than thirty years after Quadratus. From Ju&s;tin's works, which are &s;till extant, might be collected a tolerably complete account of Chri&s;t's life, in all points agreeing with that which is de|livered in our &s;criptures; taken indeed, in a great mea&s;ure, from tho&s;e &s;criptures, but &s;till proving that this account, and no other, was the account known and extant in that age.

<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to carry the&s;e citations lower, becau&s;e the hi&s;tory, after this time, occurs in ancient Chri&s;tian writings as fa|miliarly as it is wont to do in modern &s;er|mons; occurs always the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, and always that which our evangeli&s;ts repre|&s;ent.</P>

Chri&s;tianity hath travelled through dark and turbulent ages; neverthele&s;s it came out of the cloud and the &s;torm, &s;uch, in &s;ub&s;tance, as it en|tered in. Many additions were made to the primitive hi&s;tory, and the&s;e entitled to dif|ferent degrees of credit; many doctrinal errors al&s;o were from time to time grafted into the public creed, but &s;till the original &s;tory remained, and remained the &s;ame.

Our account makes the founder of the religion direct that his di&s;ciples &s;hould be baptized: we know that the fir&s;t Chri&s;|tians were baptized. Our account makes him direct that they &s;hould hold religious a&s;&s;emblies: we find that they did hold religi|ous a&s;&s;emblies. Our accounts make the apo|&s;tles a&s;&s;emble upon a &s;tated day in the week: we find, and that from information perfectly independent of our accounts, that the Chri&s;|tians of the fir&s;t century did ob&s;erve &s;tated days of a&s;&s;embling. Our hi&s;tories record the in&s;titution of the rite which we call the Lord's Supper, and a command to repeat it in perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: we find, among&s;t the early Chri&s;tians, the celebration of this rite univer&s;al.

by great di&s;tance of place and di&s;&s;imilitude of &s;ituation. It is al&s;o extremely material to remark, that there is no room for in&s;inu|ating that our books were fabricated with a &s;tudious accommodation to the u&s;ages which obtained at the time they were written; that the authors of the books found the u&s;ages e&s;tabli&s;hed, and framed the &s;tory to account for their original. The &s;cripture accounts, e&s;pecially of the Lord's Supper, are too &s;hort and cur&s;ory, not to &s;ay too ob&s;cure, and, in this view, deficient, to al|low a place for any &s;uch &s;u&s;picion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader who is conver&s;ant in the&s;e re&s;earches, by comparing the &s;hort &s;cripture accounts of the Chri&s;|tian rites above mentioned with the minute and circum|&s;tantial directions contained in the pretended apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions, will &s;ee the force of this ob&s;ervation; the difference between truth and forgery.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the proofs of the truth of our propo&s;ition, viz. that the &s;tory, which we have <HI>now,</HI> is, in &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;tory which the Chri&s;tians had <HI>then,</HI> or, in other words, that the accounts in our go&s;pels are, as to
<PB N="136" REF="146">
their principal parts at lea&s;t, the accounts which the apo&s;tles and original teachers of the religion delivered, one ari&s;es from ob|&s;erving, that it appears by the go&s;pels them|&s;elves, that the &s;tory was public at the time; that the Chri&s;tian community was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub&s;tance and principal parts of the narrative. The go&s;pels were not the original cau&s;e of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;|tory being believed, but were them&s;elves among the con&s;equences of that belief. This is expre&s;sly affirmed by St. Luke in his brief, but, as I think, very important and in|&s;tructive preface. "Fora&s;much (&s;ays the evangeli&s;t) as many have taken in hand to &s;et forth in order a declaration of tho&s;e things <HI>which are mo&s;t &s;urely believed among&s;t us, even as they aelivered them unto us, which, from the beginning, were eye-witne&s;&s;es and mini&s;ters of the word;</HI> it &s;eemed good to me al&s;o, having had perfect under&s;tanding of all things from the very fir&s;t, to write unto thee in order, mo&s;t excellent Theophilus, that thou mighte&s;t know the certainty of tho&s;e things <HI>wherein thou ha&s;t been in&s;tructed."</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="147">
This &s;hort introduction te&s;tifies, that the &s;ub|&s;tance of the hi&s;tory, which the evangeli&s;t was about to write, was already believed by Chri&s;tians; that it was believed upon the declarations of eye-witne&s;&s;es and mini&s;ters of the word; that it formed the account of their religion, in which Chri&s;tians were in|&s;tructed; that the office which the hi&s;torian propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, was to trace each parti|cular to its origin, and to fix the certainty of many things which the reader had before heard of. In St. John's Go&s;pel, the &s;ame point appears from hence, that there are &s;ome principal facts, to which the hi&s;torian refers, but which he does not relate. A remarkable in&s;tance of this kind is the <HI>a&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> which is not mentioned by St. John in its place, at the conclu&s;ion of his hi&s;tory, but which is plainly referred to in the following words of the &s;ixth chapter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Al&s;o John iii. 13. and xvi. 28.</NOTE>: "What and if ye &s;hall &s;ee the Son of man a&s;cend up where he was before." And &s;till more po&s;itively in the words which Chri&s;t, according to our evangeli&s;t,
<PB N="138" REF="148">
&s;poke to Mary after his re&s;urrection, "Touch me not, for I am not yet a&s;cended to my Father; but go unto my brethren, and &s;ay unto them, I a&s;cend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xx. 17.</NOTE>." This can only be accounted for by the &s;up|po&s;ition, that St. John wrote under a &s;en&s;e of the notoriety of Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, among&s;t tho&s;e by whom his book was likely to be read. The &s;ame account mu&s;t al&s;o be given of St. Matthew's omi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame im|portant fact. The thing was very well known, and it did not occur to the hi&s;torian, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to add any particulars concerning it. It agrees al&s;o with this &s;olu|tion, and with no other, that neither Mat|thew nor John di&s;po&s;e of the per&s;on of our Lord in any manner whatever. Other inti|mations in St. John's Go&s;pel of the then general notoriety of the &s;tory are the follow|ing: His manner of introducing his narra|tive, (ch. i. v. 15.) "John bare witne&s;s of him, and cried, &s;aying," evidently pre&s;uppo&s;es
<PB N="139" REF="149">
that his readers knew who John was. His rapid parenthetical reference to John's im|pri&s;onment, "for John was not yet ca&s;t into pri&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 24.</NOTE>," could only come from a writer who&s;e mind was in the habit of con&s;idering John's impri&s;onment as perfectly notorious. The de&s;cription of Andrew by the addition "Simon Peter's brother <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Ibid. i. 40.</P>
<P>Ibid. xxi. 24.</P></NOTE>," takes it for granted that Simon Peter was well known. His name had not been mentioned before. The evangeli&s;t's noticing &Dagger; the prevailing mi&s;con&s;truction of a di&s;cour&s;e, which Chri&s;t held with the beloved di&s;ciple, proves that the characters and the di&s;cour&s;e were already public. And the ob&s;ervation which the&s;e in&s;tances afford, is of equal validity for the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument, whoever were the authors of the hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>four</HI> circum&s;tances, fir&s;t, the recog|nition of the account in its principal parts by a &s;eries of &s;ucceeding writers; &s;econdly, the total ab&s;ence of any account of the origin of
<PB N="140" REF="150">
the religion &s;ub&s;tantially different from ours; thirdly, the early and exten&s;ive prevalence of rites and in&s;titutions, which re&s;ult from our account; fourthly, our account bearing, in its con&s;truction, proof that it is an account of facts, which were known and believed at the time; are &s;ufficient, I conceive, to &s;upport an a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;tory, which we have now, is, in general, the &s;tory which Chri&s;tians had at the beginning. I &s;ay <HI>in general;</HI> by which term I mean, that it is the &s;ame in its texture, and in its principal facts. For in&s;tance, I make no doubt, for the rea&s;ons above &s;tated, but that the re&s;ur|rection of the founder of the religion was always a part of the Chri&s;tian &s;tory. Nor can a doubt of this remain upon the mind of any one, who reflects that the re&s;urrection is, in &s;ome form or other, a&s;&s;erted, referred to, or a&s;&s;umed, in every Chri&s;tian writing, of every de&s;cription, which hath come down to us.</P>
<P>And if our evidence &s;topped here, we &s;hould have a &s;trong ca&s;e to offer: for we &s;hould
<PB N="141" REF="151">
have to alledge, that, in the reign of Tiberius Cae&s;ar, a certain number of per&s;ons &s;et about an attempt of e&s;tabli&s;hing a new religion in the world; in the pro&s;ecution of which pur|po&s;e, they voluntarily encountered great dangers, undertook great labours, &s;u&s;tained great &s;ufferings, all <HI>for</HI> a miraculous &s;tory which they publi&s;hed wherever they came; and that the re&s;urrection of a dead man, whom, during his life, they had followed and accompanied, was a con&s;tant part of this &s;tory. I know nothing in the above &s;tate|ment which can, with any appearance of rea&s;on, be di&s;puted; and I know nothing in the hi&s;tory of the human &s;pecies &s;imilar to it.</P>

<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="142" REF="152">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">There is &s;atisfactory evidence, that many per|&s;ons, profe&s;&s;ing to have been original witne&s;&s;es of the Chri&s;tian miracles, pa&s;&s;ed their lives in labours, dangers, and &s;ufferings, voluntarily undergone in atte&s;tation of the accounts which they delivered, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of tho&s;e accounts; and that they al&s;o &s;ubmitted, from the &s;ame motives, to new rules of conduct.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the &s;tory which we have now is, in the main, the &s;tory which the apo&s;tles pub|li&s;hed, is, I think, nearly certain from the con&s;iderations which have been propo&s;ed. But whether, when we come to the particu|lars and the detail of the narrative, the hi&s;|torical books of the New Te&s;tament be de|&s;erving of credit as hi&s;tories, &s;o that a fact ought to be accounted true becau&s;e it is found in them; or whether they are entitled to be con&s;idered as repre&s;enting the accounts,
<PB N="143" REF="153">
which, true or &s;al&s;e, the apo&s;tles publi&s;hed; whether their authority, in either of the&s;e views, can be tru&s;ted to, is a point which nece&s;&s;arily depends upon what we know of the books, and of their authors.</P>
<P>Now, in treating of this part of our argu|ment, the fir&s;t, and a mo&s;t material, ob&s;er|vation upon the &s;ubject is, that, &s;uch was the &s;ituation of the authors to whom the four go&s;pels are a&s;cribed, that, if any one of the four be genuine, it is &s;ufficient for our pur|po&s;e. The received author of the fir&s;t was an original apo&s;tle and emi&s;&s;ary of the reli|gion. The received author of the &s;econd was an inhabitant of Jeru&s;alem at the time, to who&s;e hou&s;e the apo&s;tles were wont to re&s;ort, and him&s;elf an attendant upon one of the mo&s;t eminent of that number. The received author of the third was a &s;tated companion and fellow traveller of the mo&s;t active of all the teachers of the religion, and in the cour&s;e of his travels frequently in the &s;ociety of the original apo&s;tles. The received author of the fourth, as well as of the fir&s;t,
<PB N="144" REF="154">
was one of the&s;e apo&s;tles. No &s;tronger evi|dence of the truth of a hi&s;tory can ari&s;e from the &s;ituation of the hi&s;torian than what is here offered. The authors of all the hi&s;tories lived at the time and upon the &s;pot. The authors of two of the hi&s;tories were pre&s;ent at many of the &s;cenes which they de&s;cribe; eye-witne&s;&s;es of the facts, ear-witne&s;&s;es of the di&s;cour&s;es; writing from per&s;onal know|ledge and recollection, and, what &s;trengthens their te&s;timony, writing upon a &s;ubject in which their minds were deeply engaged, and in which, as they mu&s;t have been very fre|quently repeating the accounts to others, the pa&s;&s;ages of the hi&s;tory would be kept conti|nually alive in their memory. Whoever reads the go&s;pels (and they ought to be read for this particular purpo&s;e) will find in them not merely a general affirmation of miracu|lous powers, but detailed circum&s;tantial ac|counts of miracles, with &s;pecifications of time, place, and per&s;ons; and the&s;e accounts many and various. In the Go&s;pels, there|fore, which bear the names of Matthew and John, the&s;e narratives, if they really proceeded
<PB N="145" REF="155">
from the&s;e men, mu&s;t either be true, as far as the &s;idelity of human recollection is u&s;ually to be depended upon, that is, mu&s;t be true in &s;ub&s;tance, and in their prin|cipal parts (which is &s;ufficient for the pur|po&s;e of proving a &s;upernatural agency), or they mu&s;t be wilful and meditated fal&s;e|hoods. Yet the writers who fabricated and uttered the&s;e fal&s;ehoods, if they be &s;uch are of the number of tho&s;e who, unle&s;s the whole contexture of the Chri&s;tian &s;tory be a dream, &s;acrificed their ea&s;e and &s;afety in the cau&s;e, and for a purpo&s;e the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;t|ent that is po&s;&s;ible with di&s;hone&s;t intentions. They were villains for no end but to teach hone&s;ty, and martyrs without the lea&s;t pro|&s;pect of honour or advantage.</P>
<P>The go&s;pels which bear the name of Mark and Luke, although not the narratives of eye-witne&s;&s;es, are, if genuine, removed from that only by one degree. They are the narratives of contemporary writers, of wri|ters them&s;elves mixing with the bu&s;ine&s;s, one of the two probably living in the place
<PB N="146" REF="156">
which was the principal &s;cene of action, both living in habits of &s;ociety and corre&s;pond|ence with tho&s;e who had been pre&s;ent at the tran&s;actions which they relate. The lat|ter of them accordingly tells us (and with apparent &s;incerity, becau&s;e he tells it without pretending to per&s;onal knowledge, and with|out claiming for his work greater authority than belonged to it), that the things, which were believed among&s;t Chri&s;tians, came from tho&s;e who from the beginning were eye-witne&s;&s;es and mini&s;ters of the word; that he had traced up accounts to their &s;ource; and that he was prepared to in&s;truct his reader in the certainty of the things which he related <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Why &s;hould not the candid and mode&s;t preface of this hi&s;torian be believed as well as that which Dion Ca&s;&s;ius prefixes to his Life of Commodus? "The&s;e things and the following I write not from the report of others, but from my own knowledge and ob&s;ervation." I &s;ee no rea&s;on to doubt but that both pa&s;&s;ages de&s;cribe truly enough the &s;ituation of the authors.</NOTE>. Very few hi&s;tories lie &s;o clo&s;e to their facts; very few hi&s;torians are &s;o nearly connected with the &s;ubject of their narrative,
<PB N="147" REF="157">
or po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch means of authentic informa|tion, as the&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the writers applies to the <HI>truth</HI> of the facts which they record. But at pre&s;ent we u&s;e their te&s;timony to a point &s;omewhat &s;hort of this, namely, that the facts recorded in the go&s;pels, whether true or fal&s;e, are the facts, and the &s;ort of facts, which the original preachers of the religion alledged. Strictly &s;peaking, I am concerned only to &s;hew, that what the go|&s;pels contain is the &s;ame as what the apo&s;tles preached. Now how &s;tands the proof of this point? A &s;et of men went about the world publi&s;hing a &s;tory compo&s;ed of mira|culous accounts (for miraculous from the very nature and exigency of the ca&s;e they mu&s;t have been), and, upon the &s;trength of the&s;e accounts, called upon mankind to quit the religions in which they had been educat|ed, and to take up, from thenceforth, a new &s;y&s;tem of opinions, and new rules of action. What is more, in atte&s;tation of the&s;e accounts, that is, in &s;upport of an in&s;titution of which
<PB N="148" REF="158">
the&s;e accounts were the foundation, the &s;ame men voluntarily expo&s;ed them&s;elves to ha|ra&s;&s;ing and perpetual labours, dangers, and &s;ufferings. We want to know what the&s;e accounts were. We have the particulars, <HI>i. e.</HI> many particulars, from two of their own number. We have them from an attendant of one of the number, and who there is rea|&s;on to believe was an inhabitant of Jeru&s;alem at the time. We have them from a fourth writer, who accompanied the mo&s;t laborious mi&s;&s;ionary of the in&s;titution in his travels; who, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e travels, was fre|quently brought into the &s;ociety of the re&s;t; and who, let it be ob&s;erved, begins his narra|tive by telling us, that he is about to relate the things which had been delivered by tho&s;e who were mini&s;ters of the word and eye-witne&s;&s;es of the fact. I do not know what information can be more &s;atisfactory than this. We may, perhaps, perceive the force and value of it more &s;en&s;ibly, if we reflect how <HI>requiring</HI> we &s;hould have been if we had wanted it. Suppo&s;ing it to be &s;ufficiently proved, that the religion, now
<PB N="149" REF="159">
profe&s;&s;ed among&s;t us, owed its original to the preaching and mini&s;try of a number of men, who, about eighteen centuries ago, &s;et forth in the world a new &s;y&s;tem of religious opinions, founded upon certain extraordi|nary things which they related of a wonder|ful per&s;on who had appeared in Judea: &s;uppo&s;e it to be al&s;o &s;ufficiently proved, that, in the cour&s;e and pro&s;ecution of their mini|&s;try, the&s;e men had &s;ubjected them&s;elves to extreme hard&s;hips, fatigue, and peril; but &s;up|po&s;e the accounts which they publi&s;hed had not been committed to writing till &s;ome ages after their times, or at lea&s;t that no hi&s;tories, but what had been compo&s;ed &s;ome ages af|terwards, had reached our hands; we &s;hould have &s;aid, and with rea&s;on, that we were willing to believe the&s;e men under the cir|cum&s;tances in which they delivered their te&s;timony, but that we did not, at this day, know with &s;ufficient evidence what their te&s;timony was. Had we received the parti|culars of it from any of their own number, from any of tho&s;e who lived and conver&s;ed with them, from any of their hearers, or even
<PB N="150" REF="160">
from any of their contemporaries, we &s;hould have had &s;omething to rely upon. Now, if our books be genuine, we have all the&s;e. We have the very &s;pecies of information which, as it appears to me, our imagination would have carved out for us, if it had been wanting.</P>
<P>But I have &s;aid, that, if <HI>any one</HI> of the four go&s;pels be genuine, we have not only direct hi&s;torical te&s;timony to the point we contend for, but te&s;timony which, &s;o far as that point is concerned, cannot rea&s;onably be rejected. If the fir&s;t go&s;pel was really written by Matthew, we have the narrative of one of the number from which to judge what were the miracles, and the kind of miracles, which the apo&s;tles attributed to Je&s;us. Although, for argument's &s;ake, and only for argument's &s;ake, we &s;hould allow that this go&s;pel had been erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribed to Matthew, yet if the go&s;pel of St. John be genuine, the ob&s;ervation holds with no le&s;s &s;trength. Again, although the go&s;pels both of Matthew and John could be &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;purious, yet, if the go&s;pel of St.
<PB N="151" REF="161">
Luke was truly the compo&s;ition of that per&s;on, or of any per&s;on, be his name what it might, who was actually in the &s;ituation in which the author of that go&s;pel profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to have been; or if the go&s;pel which bears the name of Mark really proceeded from him; we &s;till, even upon the lowe&s;t &s;up|po&s;ition, po&s;&s;e&s;s the accounts of one writer at lea&s;t, who was not only contemporary with the apo&s;tles, but a&s;&s;ociated with them in their mini&s;try; which authority &s;eems &s;ufficient, when the que&s;tion is &s;imply what it was which the&s;e apo&s;tles advanced.</P>
<P>I think it material to have this well no|ticed. The New Te&s;tament contains a great number of di&s;tinct writings, the genuinene&s;s of any one of which is almo&s;t &s;ufficient to prove the truth of the religion: it contains, however, four di&s;tinct hi&s;tories, the genuine|ne&s;s of any one of which is perfectly &s;uf|ficient. If, therefore, we mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as encountering the ri&s;k of error in a&s;&s;ign|ing the authors of our books, we are enti|tled to the advantage of &s;o many &s;eparate

probabilities. And although it &s;hould ap|pear that &s;ome of the evangeli&s;ts had &s;een and u&s;ed each other's works, this di&s;covery, whil&s;t it &s;ubtracts indeed from their charac|ter as te&s;timonies &s;trictly independent, dimi|ni&s;hes, I conceive, little, either their &s;epa|rate authority, by which I mean the autho|rity of any one that is genuine, or their mu|tual confirmation. For let the mo&s;t di&s;ad|vantageous &s;uppo&s;ition po&s;&s;ible be made con|cerning them; let it be allowed, what I &s;hould have no great difficulty in admitting, that Mark compiled his hi&s;tory almo&s;t en|tirely from tho&s;e of Matthew and Luke; and let it al&s;o, for a moment, be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e hi&s;tories were not, in fact, written by Matthew and Luke; yet if it be true that Mark, a contemporary of the apo&s;tles, liv|ing in habits of &s;ociety with the apo&s;tles, a fellow-traveller and fellow-labourer with &s;ome of them; if, I &s;ay, it be true that this per&s;on made the compilation, it follows, that the writings from which he made it exi&s;ted in the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the apo&s;tles, and not only &s;o, but that they were then in &s;uch e&s;teem and
<PB N="153" REF="165">
credit that a companion of the apo&s;tles form|ed a hi&s;tory out of them. Let the go&s;pel of Mark be called an epitome of that of Mat|thew; if a per&s;on, in the &s;ituation in which Mark is de&s;cribed to have been, actually made the epitome, it affords the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible atte&s;tation to the character of the original.</P>
<P>Again, paralleli&s;ms in &s;entences, in words, and in the order of words, have been traced out between the go&s;pel of Mat|thew and that of Luke; which concur|rence cannot ea&s;ily be explained otherwi&s;e than by &s;uppo&s;ing, either that Luke had con|&s;ulted Matthew's hi&s;tory, or, what appears to me in no wi&s;e incredible, that minutes of &s;ome of Chri&s;t's di&s;cour&s;es, as well as brief memoirs of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of his life, had been committed to writing at the time, and that &s;uch written accounts had by both authors been occa&s;ionally admitted into their hi&s;tories. Either &s;uppo&s;ition is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the acknowledged formation of St. Luke's narrative, who profe&s;&s;es not to write as an eye-witne&s;s, but to have inve&s;tigated
<PB N="154" REF="166">
the original of every account which he delivers; in other words, to have col|lected them from &s;uch documents and te&s;ti|monics, as he, who had the be&s;t opportuni|ties of making enquiries, judged to be authentic. Therefore, allowing that this writer al&s;o, in &s;ome in&s;tances, borrowed from the go&s;pel which we call Matthew's, and once more allowing, for the &s;ake of &s;tat|ing the argument, that that go&s;pel was not the production of the author to whom we a&s;cribe it, yet &s;till we have, in St. Luke's go&s;pel, a hi&s;tory given by a writer immedi|ately connected with the tran&s;action, with the witne&s;&s;es of it, with the per&s;ons engaged in it, and compo&s;ed from materials which that per&s;on, thus &s;ituated, deemed to be &s;afe &s;ources of intelligence: in other words, whatever &s;uppo&s;ition be made concerning any or all the other go&s;pels, if St. Luke's go&s;pel be genuine, we have <HI>in it</HI> a credible evidence of the point which we maintain.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel according to St. John appears to be, and is on all hands allowed to be, an

independent te&s;timony, &s;trictly and properly &s;o called. Notwith&s;tanding, therefore, any connection, or &s;uppo&s;ed connection, between &s;ome of the go&s;pels, I again repeat, what I before &s;aid, that, if any one of the four be genuine, we have in that one, &s;trong rea&s;on from the character and &s;ituation of the wri|ter to believe, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s the accounts which the original emi&s;&s;aries of the religion delivered.</P>
<P N="2">II. In treating of the written evidences of Chri&s;tianity, next to their &s;eparate, we are to con&s;ider their aggregate authority. Now there is in the evangelic hi&s;tory a cumulation of te&s;timony which belongs hardly to any other hi&s;tory, but which our habitual mode of reading the &s;criptures &s;ometimes cau&s;es us to overlook. When a pa&s;&s;age, in any wi&s;e relating to the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t, is read to us out of the epi&s;tle of Clemens Roma|nus, the epi&s;tles of Ignatius, of Polycarp, or from any other writing of that age, we are immediately &s;en&s;ible of the con&s;irmation which it affords to the &s;cripture account.
<PB N="156" REF="168">
Here is a new witne&s;s. Now if we had been accu&s;tomed to read the go&s;pel of Mat|thew alone, and had known that of Luke only as the generality of Chri&s;tians know the writings of the apo&s;tolical fathers, that is, had known that &s;uch a writing was extant and acknowledged; when we came, for the fir&s;t time, to look into what it contained, and found many of the facts which Matthew re|corded, recorded al&s;o there, many other facts of a &s;imilar nature added, and throughout the whole work the &s;ame general &s;eries of tran&s;actions &s;tated, and the &s;ame general cha|racter of the per&s;on who was the &s;ubject of the hi&s;tory pre&s;erved, I apprehend that we &s;hould &s;eel our minds &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed by this di&s;covery of fre&s;h evidence. We &s;hould feel a renewal of the &s;ame &s;entiment in fir&s;t reading the go&s;pel of St. John. That of St. Mark perhaps would &s;trike us as an abridgement of the hi&s;tory with which we were already acquainted; but we &s;hould na|turally reflect, that, if that hi&s;tory was abridged by &s;uch a per&s;on as Mark, or by any per&s;on of &s;o early an age, it afforded one
<PB N="157" REF="169">
of the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible atte&s;tations to the va|lue of the work. This &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;clo&s;ure of proof would leave us a&s;&s;ured, that there mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t &s;ome reality in a &s;tory which, not one, but many, had taken in hand to commit to writing. The very exi&s;tence of four &s;eparate hi&s;tories would &s;a|tisfy us that the &s;ubject had a foundation; and when, amid&s;t the variety which the different information of the different writ|ers had &s;upplied to their accounts, or which their different choice and judgement in &s;elect|ing their materials had produced, we ob&s;erv|ed many facts to &s;tand the &s;ame in all; of the&s;e facts, at lea&s;t, we &s;hould conclude, that they were fixed in their credit and publicity. If, after this, we &s;hould come to the know|ledge of a di&s;tinct hi&s;tory, and that al&s;o of the &s;ame age with the re&s;t, taking up the &s;ubject where the others had left it, and car|rying on a narrative of the effects produced in the world by the extraordinary cau&s;es of which we had already been informed, and which effects &s;ub&s;i&s;t at this day, we &s;hould think the reality of the original &s;tory in no

little degree e&s;tabli&s;hed by this &s;upplement. If &s;ub&s;equent enquiries &s;hould bring to our knowledge, one after another, letters writ|ten by &s;ome of the principal agents in the bu&s;ine&s;s, upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, and during the time of their activity and concern in it, a&s;|&s;uming all along and recognizing the origi|nal &s;tory, agitating the que&s;tions that aro&s;e out of it, pre&s;&s;ing the obligations which re|&s;ulted from it, giving advice and directions to tho&s;e who acted upon it, I conceive that we &s;hould find, in every one of the&s;e, a &s;till further &s;upport to the conclu&s;ion we had formed. At pre&s;ent the weight of this &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive confirmation is, in a great mea&s;ure, unperceived by us. The evidence does not appear to us what it is; for, being from our infancy accu&s;tomed to regard the New Te&s;|tament as one book, we &s;ee in it only one te&s;timony. The whole occurs to us as a &s;ingle evidence; and its different parts, not as di&s;tinct atte&s;tations, but as different por|tions only of the &s;ame. Yet in this concep|tion of the &s;ubject we are certainly mi&s;|taken; for the very di&s;crepancies among&s;t

the &s;everal documents which form our vo|lume, prove, if all other proof was wanting, that in their original compo&s;ition they were &s;eparate, and mo&s;t of them independent pro|ductions.</P>
<P>If we di&s;po&s;e our ideas in a different or|der, the matter &s;tands thus:&mdash;Whil&s;t the tran&s;action was recent, and the original wit|ne&s;&s;es were at hand to relate it; and whil&s;t the apo&s;tles were bu&s;ied in preaching and travelling, in collecting di&s;ciples, in forming and regulating &s;ocieties of converts, in &s;up|porting them&s;elves again&s;t oppo&s;ition; whil&s;t they exerci&s;ed their mini&s;try under the ha|ra&s;&s;ings of frequent per&s;ecution, and in a &s;tate of almo&s;t continual alarm, it is not pro|bable that, in this engaged, anxicus, and un&s;ettled condition of life, they would think immediately of writing hi&s;tories for the in|formation of the public or of po&s;terity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This thought occurred to Eu&s;ebius&mdash;"Nor were the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t greatly concerned about the writ|ing of books, being engaged in a more excellent mini&s;try, which is above all human power."

But it is very probable, that emergencies might draw from &s;ome of them, occa&s;ional letters upon the &s;ubject of their mi&s;&s;ion, to converts, or to &s;ocieties of converts, with which they were connected; or that they might addre&s;s written di&s;cour&s;es and exhor|tations to the di&s;ciples of the in&s;titution at large, which would be received and read with a re&s;pect proportioned to the character of the writer. Accounts in the mean time would get abroad, of the extraordinary things that had been pa&s;&s;ing, written with different degrees of information and correctne&s;s. The exten&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian &s;ociety, which could no longer be in&s;tructed by a per&s;onal intercour&s;e with the apo&s;tles, and the po&s;|&s;ible circulation of imperfect or erroneous narratives, would &s;oon teach &s;ome among&s;t them the expediency of &s;ending forth au|thentic memoirs of the life and doctrine of their ma&s;ter. When accounts appeared, authorized

by the name, and credit, and &s;itua|tion of the writers, recommended or recog|nized by the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t preachers of the religion, or found to coincide with what the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t preachers of the religion had taught, other accounts would fall into di&s;u&s;e and neglect; whil&s;t the&s;e, maintain|ing their reputation (as, if genuine and well founded, they would do) under the te&s;t of time, enquiry, and contradiction, might be expected to make their way into the hands of Chri&s;tians of all countries of the world.</P>
<P>This &s;eems the natural progre&s;s of the bu|&s;ine&s;s; and with this the records in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the evidence concerning them, corre&s;pond. We have remaining, in the fir&s;t place, many letters of the kind above de&s;cribed, which have been pre&s;erved with a care and fidelity an&s;wering to the re&s;pect with which we may &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch letters would be received. But as the&s;e letters were not written to prove the truth of the Chri&s;|tian religion, in the &s;en&s;e in which we re|gard that que&s;tion; nor to convey information
<PB N="162" REF="174">
of facts, of which tho&s;e to whom the letters were written had been previou&s;ly in|formed; we are not to look in them for any thing more than incidental allu&s;ions to the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory. We are able, however, to gather from the&s;e documents various particu|lar atte&s;tations which have been already enu|merated; and this is a &s;pecies of written evi|dence, as far as it goes, in the highe&s;t degree &s;atisfactory, and in point of time perhaps the fir&s;t. But for our more circum&s;tantial in|formation we have, in the next place, five direct <HI>bi&s;tories,</HI> bearing the names of per&s;ons acquainted, by their &s;ituation, with the truth of what they relate, and three of them pur|porting, in the very body of the narrative, to be written by &s;uch per&s;ons: of which books we know that &s;ome were in the hands of tho&s;e who were contemporaries of the apo&s;tles, and that, in the age immediately po&s;terior to that, they were in the hands, we may &s;ay, of every one, and received by Chri&s;tians with &s;o much re&s;pect and defe|rence, as to be con&s;tantly quoted and refer|red to by them without any doubt of the
<PB N="163" REF="175">
truth of their accounts. They were treated as &s;uch hi&s;tories, proceeding from &s;uch au|thorities, might expect to be treated. In the preface to one of our hi&s;tories we have inti|mations left us of the exi&s;tence of &s;ome an|cient accounts which are now lo&s;t. There is nothing in this circum&s;tance that can &s;ur|pri&s;e us. It was to be expected from the magnitude and novelty of the occa&s;ion that &s;uch accounts would <HI>&s;warm.</HI> When better accounts came forth, the&s;e died away. Our pre&s;ent hi&s;tories &s;uper&s;eded others. They &s;oon acquired a character and e&s;tabli&s;hed a reputation which does not appear to have belonged to any other: that, at lea&s;t, can be proved concerning them, which cannot be proved concerning any other.</P>
<P>But to return to the point which led to the&s;e reflections. By con&s;idering our re|cords in either of the two views in which we have repre&s;ented them, we &s;hall perceive that we po&s;&s;e&s;s a <HI>collection of proofs,</HI> and not a naked or &s;olitary te&s;timony; and that the written evidence is of &s;uch a kind, and comes
<PB N="164" REF="176">
to us in &s;uch a &s;tate, as the natural order and progre&s;s of things, in the infancy of the in|&s;titution, might be expected to produce.</P>
<P>Thirdly; The genuinene&s;s of the hi&s;tori|cal books of the New Te&s;tament is undoubt|edly a point of importance, becau&s;e the &s;trength of their evidence is augmented by our knowledge of the &s;ituation of their au|thors, their relation to the &s;ubject, and the part which they &s;u&s;tained in the tran&s;action; and the te&s;timonies which we are able to produce, compo&s;e a &s;irm ground of per&s;ua|&s;ion that the go&s;pels were written by the per|&s;ons who&s;e names they bear. Neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;tate, that, to the argu|ment which I am endeavouring to main|tain, this point is not e&s;&s;ential; I mean, &s;o e&s;&s;ential as that the fate of the argument de|pends upon it. The que&s;tion before us is, whether the go&s;pels exhibit the &s;tory which the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t emi&s;&s;aries of the religion publi&s;hed, and <HI>for</HI> which they acted and &s;uffered, in the manner in which, for &s;ome miraculous &s;tory or other, they did act and
<PB N="165" REF="177">
&s;uffer. Now let us &s;uppo&s;e that we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no other information concerning the&s;e books than that they were written by early di&s;ci|ples of Chri&s;tianity; that they were known and read during the time, or near the time, of the original apo&s;tles of the religion; that by Chri&s;tians whom the apo&s;tles in&s;tructed, by &s;ocieties of Chri&s;tians which the apo&s;tles &s;ounded, the&s;e books were <HI>received</HI> (by which term "received" I mean that they were believed to contain authentic accounts of the tran&s;action upon which the religion re&s;ted, and accounts which were accordingly u&s;ed, repeated, and relied upon), this recep|tion would be a valid proof that the&s;e books, whoever were the authors of them, mu&s;t have accorded with what the apo&s;tles taught. A reception by the fir&s;t race of Chri&s;tians is evidence that they agreed with what the fir&s;t teachers of the religion delivered. In par|ticular, if they had not agreed with what the apo&s;tles them&s;elves preached, how could they have gained credit in churches and &s;ocieties which the apo&s;tles e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="178">
Now the fact of their early exi&s;tence, and not only of their exi&s;tence but their reputa|tion, is made out by &s;ome ancient te&s;timo|nies which do not happen to &s;pecify the names of the writers: add to which, what hath been already hinted, that two out of the four go&s;pels contain averments in the body of the hi&s;tory, which, though they do not di&s;clo&s;e the names, fix the time and &s;i|tuation of the authors, viz. that one was written by an eye-witne&s;s of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, the other by a contemporary of the apo&s;tles. In the go&s;pel of St. John, (xix. 35.) after de&s;cribing the crucifixion, with the particular circum&s;tance of piercing Chri&s;t's &s;ide with a &s;pear, the hi&s;torian adds, as for him&s;elf, "and he that &s;aw it bare re|cord, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he faith true. that ye might believe." Again, (xxi. 24.) after relating a conver&s;a|tion which pa&s;&s;ed between Peter and the di&s;ciple, as it is there expre&s;&s;ed, whom Je&s;us loved, it is added, "this is the di&s;ciple which te&s;ti&s;ieth of the&s;e things and wrote the&s;e things." This te&s;timony, let it be remarked,
<PB N="167" REF="179">
is not the le&s;s worthy of regard, becau&s;e it is in one view imperfect. The name is not mentioned; which, if a fraudulent pur|po&s;e had been intended, would have been done. The third of our pre&s;ent go&s;pels purports to have been written by the per&s;on who wrote the Acts of the Apo&s;tles; in which latter hi&s;tory, or rather latter part of the &s;ame hi&s;tory, the author, by u&s;ing in va|rious places the fir&s;t per&s;on plural, declares him&s;elf to have been a contemporary of all, and a companion of one of the original preachers of the religion.</P>

We are able to produce a great number of ancient <HI>manu&s;cripts,</HI> found in many dif|ferent countries, and in countries widely di&s;|tant from each other, all of them anterior to the art of printing, &s;ome certainly &s;even or eight hundred years old, and &s;ome which have been pre&s;erved probably above a thou|&s;and years <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Alexandrian manu&s;cript, now in the British Mu&s;eum, was written probably in the fourth or fifth century.</NOTE>. We have al&s;o many ancient
<PB N="170" REF="182">
<HI>ver&s;ions</HI> of the&s;e books, and &s;ome of them into languages which are not at pre&s;ent, nor for many ages have been, &s;poken in any part of the world. The exi&s;tence of the&s;e manu&s;cripts and ver&s;ions proves that the &s;criptures were not the production of any modern contrivance. It does away al&s;o the uncertainty which hangs over &s;uch publica|tions as the works, real or pretended, of O&s;&s;ian and Rowley, in which the editors are challenged to produce their manu&s;cripts, and to &s;how where they obtained their copies. The number of manu&s;cripts, far exceeding tho&s;e of any other book, and their wide dis|per&s;ion, affords an argument, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to the &s;en&s;es, that the &s;criptures, anci|ently, in like manner as at this day, were more read and &s;ought after than any other books, and that al&s;o in many different coun|tries. The greate&s;t part of &s;purious Chri&s;|tian writings are utterly lo&s;t, the re&s;t pre|&s;erved by &s;ome &s;ingle manu&s;cript. There is weight al&s;o in Dr. Bentley's ob&s;ervation, that the New Te&s;tament has &s;uffered le&s;s injury by the errors of tran&s;cribers than the
<PB N="171" REF="183">
works of any profane author of the &s;ame &s;ize and antiquity; that is, there never was any writing in the pre&s;ervation and purity of which the world was &s;o intere&s;ted or &s;o careful.</P>
<P N="2">II. An argument of great weight with tho&s;e who are judges of the proofs upon which it is founded, and capable, through their te&s;ti|mony, of being addre&s;&s;ed to every under|&s;tanding, is that which ari&s;es from the &s;tyle and language of the New Te&s;tament. It is ju&s;t &s;uch a language as might be expected from the apo&s;tles, from per&s;ons of their age and in their &s;ituation, and from no other per&s;ons. It is the &s;tyle neither of cla&s;&s;ic authors, nor of the ancient Chri&s;tian fathers, but Greek coming from men of Hebrew origin; abounding, that is, with Hebraic and Syriac idioms, &s;uch as would naturally be found in the writings of men who u&s;ed a language &s;poken indeed where they lived, but not the common dialect of the country. This happy peculiarity is a &s;trong proof of the genuinene&s;s of the&s;e writings; for who
<PB N="172" REF="184">
&s;hould forge them? The Chri&s;tian fathers were for the mo&s;t part totally ignorant of Hebrew, and therefore were not likely to in&s;ert Hebrai&s;ms and Syria&s;ms into their writings. The few who had a knowledge of the He|brew, as Ju&s;tin Martyr, Origen, and Epi|phanius, wrote in a language which bears no re&s;emblance to that of the New Te&s;tament. The Nazarenes, who under&s;tood Hebrew, u&s;ed chie&s;ly, perhaps almo&s;t entirely, the go&s;pel of St. Matthew, and therefore cannot be &s;u&s;pected of forging the re&s;t of the &s;acred writings. The argument, at any rate, proves the antiquity of the&s;e books; that they be|longed to the age of the apo&s;tles; that they could be compo&s;ed indeed in no other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this argument &s;tated more at large in Mi|chaelis's Introduction (Mar&s;h's tran&s;lation), vol. I. c. ii. &s;ec. 10. from which the&s;e ob&s;ervations are taken.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">III. Why &s;hould we que&s;tion the genuine|ne&s;s of the&s;e books? Is it for that they con|tain accounts of &s;upernatural events? I apprehend that this, at the bottom, is the
<PB N="173" REF="185">
real, though &s;ecret, cau&s;e of our he&s;itation about them; for had the writings in&s;cribed with the name of Matthew and John related nothing but ordinary hi&s;tory, there would have been no more doubt whether the&s;e writings were theirs, than there is concern|ing the acknowledged works of Jo&s;ephus or Philo, that is, there would have been no doubt at all. Now it ought to be con&s;idered that this rea&s;on, however it may apply to the credit which is given to a writer's judg|ment or veracity, affects the que&s;tion of genuinene&s;s very indirectly. The works of Bede exhibit many wonderful relations; but who for that rea&s;on doubts that they were written by Bede? The &s;ame of a multitude of other authors. To which may be added, that we a&s;k no more for our books than what we allow to other books in &s;ome &s;ort &s;imilar to ours. We do not deny the genuinene&s;s of the Koran. We admit that the hi&s;tory of Appollonius Tyanaeus, purporting to be written by Philo&s;tratus, was really written by Philo&s;tratus.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="174" REF="186">
IV. If it had been an ea&s;y thing in the early times of the in&s;titution to have forged Chri&s;tian writings, and to have obtained cur|rency and reception to the forgeries, we &s;hould have had many appearing in the name of Chri&s;t him&s;elf. No writings would have been received with &s;o much avidity and re|&s;pect as the&s;e; con&s;equently none afforded &s;o great temptation to forgery. Yet have we heard but of one attempt of this &s;ort de&s;erv|ing of the &s;malle&s;t notice, <HI>that</HI> in a piece of a very few lines, and &s;o far from &s;ucceed|ing, I mean, from obtaining acceptance and reputation, or an acceptance and reputation in any wi&s;e &s;imilar to that which can be proved to have attended the books of the New Te&s;tament, that it is not &s;o much as mentioned by any writer of the three fir&s;t centuries. The learned reader need not be informed that I mean the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t to Abgarus, king of Ede&s;&s;a, found at pre&s;ent in the work of Eu&s;ebius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Eccl. l. i. c. 15.</NOTE>, as a piece ac|knowledged by him, though not without con|&s;iderable doubt whether the whole pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="175" REF="187">
be not an interpolation, as it is mo&s;t certain, that, after the publication of Eu&s;ebius's work, this epi&s;tle was univer&s;ally rejected <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;tin, A. D. 395, (De Confen&s;. Evang. c. 34.) had <HI>heard</HI> that the Pagans pretended to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an epi&s;tle from Chri&s;t to Peter and Paul, but he had never &s;een it, and appears to doubt of the exi&s;tence of any &s;uch piece, either genuine or &s;purious. No other ancient writer mentions it. He al&s;o, and he alone, notices, and that in order to condemn it, an epi&s;tle a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t by the Manichees, A. D. 270, and a &s;hort hymn attributed to him by the Pri&s;cilliani&s;ts, A. D. 378, (cont. Fau&s;t. Man. lib. xxviii. c. 4.) The late|ne&s;s of the writer who notices the&s;e things, the manner in which he notices them, and above all, the &s;ilence of every preceding writer, render them unworthy of con|&s;ideration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">V. If the a&s;cription of the go&s;pels to their re&s;pective authors had been arbitrary or con|jectural, they would have been a&s;cribed to more eminent men. This ob&s;ervation holds concerning the three fir&s;t go&s;pels, the reputed authors of which were enabled, by their &s;ituation, to obtain true intelligence, and were likely to deliver an hone&s;t account of
<PB N="176" REF="188">
what they knew; but were per&s;ons not di&s;|tingui&s;hed in the hi&s;tory by extraordinary marks of notice or commendation. Of the apo&s;tles, I hardly know any one of whom le&s;s is &s;aid than of Matthew; or of whom the little that is &s;aid, is le&s;s calculated to mag|nify his character. Of Mark nothing is &s;aid in the Go&s;pels; and what is &s;aid of any per|&s;on of that name in the Acts, and in the Epi&s;tles, in no part be&s;tows prai&s;e or emi|nence upon him. The name of Luke is mentioned only in St. Paul's Epi&s;tles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Col. iv. 14.</P>
<P>2 Tim. iv. 11.</P>
<P>Philem. 24.</P></NOTE>, and that very tran&s;iently. The judgement, there|fore, which a&s;&s;igned the&s;e writings to the&s;e authors, proceeded, it may be pre&s;umed, upon proper knowledge and evidence, and not upon a voluntary choice of names.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Chri&s;tian writers and Chri&s;tian churches appear to have &s;oon arrived at a very general agreement upon the &s;ubject, and that without the interpo&s;ition of any public authority. When the diver&s;ity of opinion, which prevailed and prevails among Chri&s;tians
<PB N="177" REF="189">
in other points, is con&s;idered, their concurrence in the canon of &s;cripture is re|markable, and of great weight, e&s;pecially as it &s;eems to have been the re&s;ult of private and free enquiry. We have no knowledge of any interference of authority in the que&s;|tion before the council of Laodicea in the year 363. Probably the decree of this coun|cil rather declared than regulated the public judgement, or, more properly &s;peaking, the judgement of &s;ome neighbouring churches; the council it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ting of no more than thirty or forty bi&s;hops of Lydia and the ad|joining countries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner's Cred. vol. viii. p. 291 et &s;eq.</NOTE>. Nor does its authority &s;eem to have extended farther; for we find numerous Chri&s;tian writers, after this time, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the que&s;tion, "what books were entitled to be received as &s;cripture," with great freedom, upon proper grounds of evidence, and without any reference to the deci&s;ion at Laodicea.</P>

<P>THESE con&s;iderations are not to be ne|glected: but of an argument concerning the genuinene&s;s of ancient writings, the &s;ub&s;tance undoubtedly and &s;trength is ancient te&s;ti|mony.</P>
<P>This te&s;timony it is nece&s;&s;ary to exhibit &s;omewhat in detail; for when Chri&s;tian advo|cates merely tell us, that we have the &s;ame rea&s;on for believing the Go&s;pels to be written by the evangeli&s;ts, who&s;e names they bear, as we have for believing the Commentaries to be Ce&s;ar's, the Aeneid Virgil's, or the Orations Cicero's, they content them&s;elves with an imperfect repre&s;entation. They &s;tate nothing more than what is true, but they do not &s;tate the truth correctly. In the number, variety, and early date of our
<PB N="179" REF="191">
te&s;timonies, we far exceed all other ancient books. For one, which the mo&s;t celebrated work of the mo&s;t celebrated Greek or Ro|man writer can alledge, we produce many. But then it is more requi&s;ite in our books, than in theirs, to &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;h them from &s;purious competitors. The re&s;ult, I am convinced, will be &s;atisfactory to every fair enquirer; but this circum&s;tance renders an enquiry nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In a work, however, like the pre&s;ent, there is a difficulty in finding a place for evi|dence of this kind. To pur&s;ue the detail of proofs throughout, would be to tran&s;cribe a great part of Dr. Lardner's eleven octavo volumes; to leave the argument without proofs, is to leave it without effect; for the per&s;ua&s;ion produced by this &s;pecies of evi|dence depends upon a view and induction of the particulars which compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>The method which I propo&s;e to my&s;elf is, fir&s;t, to place before the reader, in one view, the propo&s;itions which compri&s;e the
<PB N="180" REF="192">
&s;everal heads of our te&s;timony, and after|wards, to repeat the &s;ame propo&s;itions in &s;o many di&s;tinct &s;ections, with the nece&s;&s;ary authorities &s;ubjoined to each <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader, when he has the propo&s;itions before him, will ob&s;erve that the argument, if he &s;hould omit the &s;ections, proceeds connectedly from this point.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The following, then, are the allegations upon the &s;ubject, which are capable of being e&s;tabli&s;hed by proof:</P>
<P N="1">I. That the hi&s;torical books of the New Te&s;tament, meaning thereby the four Go&s;|pels and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, are quoted, or alluded to, by a &s;eries of Chri&s;tian writers, beginning with tho&s;e who were contempo|rary with the apo&s;tles, or who immediately followed them, and proceeding in clo&s;e and regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from their time to the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">II. That when they are quoted, or alluded to, they are quoted or alluded to with pe|culiar re&s;pect, as books <HI>&s;ui generis;</HI> as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="181" REF="193">
an authority which belonged to no other books, and as conclu&s;ive in all que&s;|tions and controver&s;ies among&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="3">III. That they were, in very early times, collected into a di&s;tinct volume.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by ap|propriate names and titles of re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="5">V. That they were publicly read and ex|pounded in the religious a&s;&s;emblies of the early Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That commentaries were written upon them, harmonies formed out of them, different copies carefully collated, and ver|&s;ions of them made into different languages.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That they were received by Chri&s;|tians of different &s;ects, by many heretics as well as catholics, and u&s;ually appealed to by both &s;ides in the controver&s;ies which aro&s;e in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="182" REF="194">
VIII. That the four Go&s;pels, the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, thirteen Epi&s;tles of St. Paul, the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of John, and the fir&s;t of Peter, were received, without doubt, by tho&s;e who doubted concerning the other books which are included in our pre&s;ent canon.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the Go&s;pels were attacked by the early adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity, as books containing the accounts upon which the religion was founded.</P>
<P N="10">X. That formal catalogues of authentic &s;criptures were publi&s;hed; in all which our pre&s;ent &s;acred hi&s;tories were included.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the&s;e propo&s;itions cannot be affirmed of any other books, claiming to be books of &s;cripture; by which are meant tho&s;e books, which are commonly called apocry|phal books of the New Te&s;tament.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The hi&s;torical books of the New Te&s;tament, meaning thereby the four Go&s;pels and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, are quoted, or alluded to, by a &s;eries of Chri&s;tian writers, begin|ning with tho&s;e who were contemporary with the Apo&s;tles, or who immediately fol|lowed them, and proceeding in clo&s;e and regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from their time to the pre&s;ent.</HEAD>
<P>THE medium of proof &s;tated in this pro|po&s;ition is, of all others, the mo&s;t unque&s;|tionable, the lea&s;t liable to any practices of fraud, and is not dimini&s;hed by the lap&s;e of ages. Bi&s;hop Burnet, in the Hi&s;tory of his own Times, in&s;erts various extracts from Lord Clarendon's Hi&s;tory. <HI>One</HI> &s;uch in&s;er|tion is a proof, that Lord Clarendon's Hi&s;tory was extant at the time when Bi&s;hop Burnet wrote, that it had been read by Bi&s;hop Burnet,
<PB N="184" REF="196">
that it was received by Bi&s;hop Burnet as a work of Lord Clarendon's, and al&s;o re|garded by him as an authentic account of the tran&s;actions which it relates: and it will be a proof of the&s;e points a thou&s;and years hence, or as long as the books exi&s;t. Quintilian having quoted as Cicero's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quint. lib. xi. c. 1.</NOTE>, that well-known trait of di&s;&s;embled vanity, <Q>Si quid e&s;t in me ingenii, Judices, quod &s;entio qu&agrave;m &s;it exiguum&mdash;</Q> the quotation would be &s;trong evidence, were there any doubt, that the oration, which opens with this addre&s;s, actually came from Cicero's pen. The&s;e in&s;tances, however &s;imple, may &s;erve to point out to a reader, who is little accu&s;tomed to &s;uch re&s;earches, the nature and value of the argument.</P>
<P>The te&s;timonies which we have to bring forward under this propo&s;ition are the fol|lowing:</P>
<P N="1">I. There is extant an epi&s;tle a&s;cribed to
<PB N="185" REF="197">
Barnabas <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner's Cred. ed. 1755, vol. i. p. 23 et &s;eq. The reader will ob&s;erve from the references, that the materials of the&s;e &s;ections are almo&s;t entirely extracted from Dr. Lardner's work&mdash;my office con&s;i&s;ted in ar|rangement and &s;election.</NOTE>, the companion of Paul. It is quoted as the Epi&s;tle of Barnabas by Clement of Alexandria, A. D. 194; by Origen, A. D. 230. It is mentioned by Eu&s;ebius, A. D. 315, and by Jerome, A. D. 392, as an an|cient work in their time, bearing the name of Barnabas, and as well known and read among&s;t Chri&s;tians, though not accounted a part of Scripture. It purports to have been written &s;oon after the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;a|lem, during the calamities which followed that di&s;a&s;ter; and it bears the character of the age to which it profe&s;&s;es to belong.</P>
<P>In this epi&s;tle appears the following re|markable pa&s;&s;age:&mdash;"Let us, therefore, be|ware le&s;t it come upon us, <HI>as it is written,</HI> There are many called, few cho&s;en." From the expre&s;&s;ion, "as it is written," we infer with certainty, that, at the time when the
<PB N="186" REF="198">
author of this epi&s;tle lived, there was a book extant, well known to Chri&s;tians, and of authority among&s;t them, containing the&s;e words&mdash;"Many are called, few cho&s;en." Such a book is our pre&s;ent Go&s;pel of St. Matthew, in which this text is twice found <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xx. 16. xxii. 14.</NOTE>, and is found in no other book now known. There is a farther ob&s;ervation to be made upon the terms of the quotation. The writer of the epi&s;tle was a Jew. The phra&s;e "it is written" was the very form in which the Jews quoted their &s;criptures. It is not probable, therefore, that he would have u&s;ed this phra&s;e, and without qualification, of any books but what had acquired a kind of &s;crip|tural authority. If the pa&s;&s;age remarked in this ancient writing had been found in one of St. Paul's epi&s;tles, it would have been e&s;|teemed by every one a high te&s;timony to St. Matthew's go&s;pel. It ought, therefore, to be remembered, that the writing in which it <HI>is</HI> found was probably by very few years po&s;terior to tho&s;e of St. Paul.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="199">
Be&s;ide this pa&s;&s;age, there are al&s;o in the epi&s;tle before us &s;everal others, in which the &s;entiment is the &s;ame with what we meet with in St. Matthew's go&s;pel, and two or three in which we recognize the &s;ame words. In particular, the author of the epi&s;tle repeats the precept, "Give to every one that a&s;keth thee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 42.</NOTE>," and faith that Chri&s;t cho&s;e as his apo&s;tles, who were to preach the go&s;pel, men who were great &s;inners, that he might &s;hew that he came "not to call the righteous, but &s;inners, to repentance <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. ix. 13.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">II. We are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an epi&s;tle writ|ten by Clement, Bi&s;hop of Rome <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lardner's Cred. vol. i. p. 62 et &s;eq.</NOTE>, whom ancient writers, without any doubt or &s;cru|ple, a&s;&s;ert to have been the Clement whom St. Paul mentions, Phil. iv. 3. "with <HI>Clement</HI> al&s;o, and other my fellow labourers, who&s;e names are in the book of life." This epi&s;tle is &s;poken of by the ancients as an epi&s;tle acknowledged by all; and, as Irenaeus
<PB N="188" REF="200">
well repre&s;ents its value, "written by Cle|ment, who had &s;een the ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tles and conver&s;ed with them, who had the preaching of the apo&s;tles &s;till &s;ounding in his ears, and their traditions before his eyes." It is ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the church of Corinth; and what alone may &s;eem almo&s;t deci&s;ive of its authen|ticity, Diony&s;ius, Bi&s;hop of Corinth, about the year 170, <HI>i. e.</HI> about eighty or ninety years after the epi&s;tle was written, bears wit|ne&s;s, "that it had been wont to be read in that church from ancient times."</P>
<P>This epi&s;tle affords, among&s;t others, the following valuable pa&s;&s;ages:&mdash;"E&s;pecially remembering the words of the Lord Je&s;us which he &s;pake, teaching gentlene&s;s and long &s;uffering; for thus he &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy." Mat. v. 7.&mdash;"Forgive, and ye &s;hall be for|given; give, and it &s;hall be given unto you." Luke vi. 37, 38.&mdash;"Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgement ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged, and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again." Mat. vii. 2.</NOTE>: Be ye
<PB N="189" REF="201">
merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven unto you; as you do, &s;o &s;hall it be done unto you; as you give, &s;o &s;hall it be given unto you; as ye judge, &s;o &s;hall ye be judged; as ye &s;hew kindne&s;s, &s;o &s;hall kindne&s;s be &s;hewn unto you; with what mea&s;ure ye mete, with the &s;ame it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you. By this command, and by the&s;e rules, let us e&s;tabli&s;h our&s;elves, that we may always walk obedi|ently to his holy words."</P>
<P>Again, "Remember the words of the Lord Je&s;us, for he &s;aid, Wo to that man by whom offences come; it were better for him that he had not been born, than that he &s;hould offend one of my elect; it were bet|ter for him that a mill-&s;tone &s;hould be tied about his neck, and that he &s;hould be drowned in the &s;ea, than that he &s;hould of|fend one of my little ones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xviii. 6. "But who&s;o &s;hall offend one of the&s;e little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill-&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and that he were ca&s;t into the &s;ea." The latter part of the pa&s;&s;age in Clement agrees more exactly with Luke xvii. 2. "It were better for him that a mill-&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and he ca&s;t into the &s;ea, than that he &s;hould offend one of the&s;e little ones."</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="202">
In both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages we perceive the high re&s;pect paid to the words of Chri&s;t as recorded by the evangeli&s;ts: <HI>"Remember</HI> the words of the Lord Je&s;us&mdash;by this command and by the&s;e rules let us e&s;tabli&s;h our&s;elves, that we may always walk obediently to his holy words." We perceive al&s;o in Clement a total uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doubt, whether the&s;e were the real words of Chri&s;t, which are read as &s;uch in the go&s;pels. This ob&s;er|vation indeed belongs to the whole &s;eries of te&s;timony, and e&s;pecially to the mo&s;t ancient part of it. Whenever any thing now read in the go&s;pels is met with in an early Chri&s;|tian writing, it is always ob&s;erved to &s;tand there as acknowledged truth, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be in|troduced without he&s;itation, doubt, or apo|logy. It is to be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that as this epi&s;tle was written in the name of the church of Rome, and addre&s;&s;ed to the church of Corinth, it ought to be taken as exhibiting
<PB N="191" REF="203">
the judgement not only of Clement, who drew up the letter, but of the&s;e churches them&s;elves, at lea&s;t as to the authority of the books referred to.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that, as Clement hath not u&s;ed words of quotation, it is not certain that he refers to any book whatever. The words of Chri&s;t, which he has put down, he might him&s;elf have heard from the apo&s;tles, or might have received through the ordinary medium of oral tradition. This hath been &s;aid; but that no &s;uch inference can be drawn from the ab&s;ence of words of quota|tion is proved by the three following con&s;i|derations:&mdash;Fir&s;t, that Clement, in the very &s;ame manner, namely, without any mark of reference, u&s;es a pa&s;&s;age now found in the epi&s;tle to the Romans <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 29.</NOTE>; which pa&s;&s;age, from the peculiarity of the words which compo&s;e it, and from their order, it is mani|fe&s;t that he mu&s;t have taken from the book. The &s;ame remark may be repeated of &s;ome
<PB N="192" REF="204">
&s;ingular &s;entiments in the epi&s;tle to the He|brews. Secondly, that there are many &s;en|tences of St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corin|thians &s;tanding in Clement's epi&s;tle without any &s;ign of quotation, which yet certainly are quotations; becau&s;e it appears that Cle|ment had St. Paul's epi&s;tle before him, ina&s;|much as in one place he mentions it in terms too expre&s;s to leave us in any doubt&mdash;"Take into your hands the epi&s;tle of the ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tle Paul." Thirdly, that this method of adopting words of &s;cripture, without refer|ence or acknowledgement, was, as will ap|pear in the &s;equel, a method in general u&s;e among&s;t the mo&s;t ancient Chri&s;tian writers. The&s;e analogies not only repel the objection, but ca&s;t the pre&s;umption on the other &s;ide; and afford a con&s;iderable degree of po&s;itive proof, that the words in que&s;tion have been borrowed from the places of &s;cripture in which we now find them.</P>
<P>But take it if you will the other way, that Clement had heard the&s;e words from the apo&s;tles or fir&s;t teachers of Chri&s;tianity; with
<PB N="193" REF="205">
re&s;pect to the preci&s;e point of our argument, viz. that the &s;criptures contain what the apo&s;tles taught, this &s;uppo&s;ition may &s;erve almo&s;t as well.</P>
<P N="3">III. Near the conclu&s;ion of the epi&s;tle to the Romans, St. Paul, among&s;t others, &s;ends the following &s;alutation: "Salute A&s;yncri|tus, Phlegon, <HI>Hermas,</HI> Patrobus, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them."</P>
<P>Of Hermas, who appears in this cata|logue of Roman Chri&s;tians as contemporary with St. Paul, a book bearing the name, and it is mo&s;t probable rightly, is &s;till remain|ing.

D. 178, Clement of Alexandria, A. D. 194, Tertullian, A. D. 200, Origen, A. D. 230. The notes of time extant in the epi&s;tle it&s;elf agree with its title, and with the te&s;timonies concerning it, for it purports to have been written during the lifetime of Clement.</P>

<P N="4">IV.

As to the manner of quotation this is ob|&s;ervable:&mdash;Ignatius, in one place, &s;peaks of St. Paul in terms of high re&s;pect, and quotes his epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians by <HI>name;</HI> yet in &s;everal other places he borrows words and &s;entiments from the &s;ame epi&s;tle without mentioning it: which &s;hews, that this was his general manner of u&s;ing and applying writings then extant, and then of high au|thority.</P>

<P>Quotations al&s;o are found from the Go|&s;pel of St. John.</P>
<P>What, moreover, &s;eems extremely mate|rial to be ob&s;erved, is, that in all Ju&s;tin's works, from which might be extracted al|mo&s;t a complete life of Chri&s;t, there are but two in&s;tances, in which he refers to any thing as &s;aid or done by Chri&s;t, which is not related concerning him in our pre&s;ent go|&s;pels: which &s;hews, that the&s;e go&s;pels, and the&s;e, we may &s;ay, alone, were the authori|ties from which the Chri&s;tians of that day drew the information upon which they de|pended. One of the&s;e in&s;tances is of a &s;ay|ing of Chri&s;t not met with in any book now extant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Wherefore al&s;o our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has &s;aid, In what&s;oever I &s;hall find you, in the &s;ame I will al&s;o judge you." Po&s;&s;ibly Ju&s;tin de&s;igned not to quote any text, but to repre&s;ent the &s;en&s;e of many of our Lord's &s;ayings. Fabricius has ob&s;erved, that this &s;aying has been quoted by many writers, and that Ju&s;tin is the only one who a&s;cribes it to our Lord, and that perhaps by a &s;lip of his memory.</P>
<P>Words re&s;embling the&s;e are read repeatedly in Eze|kiel; "I will judge them according to their ways." (vii. 3. xxxiii. 20). It is remarkable that Ju&s;tin had but ju&s;t before expre&s;sly quoted Ezekiel. Mr. Jones upon this circum&s;tance founded a conjecture, that Ju&s;tin wrote only "the Lord hath &s;aid," intending to quote the words of God, or rather the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words, in Ezekiel; and that &s;ome tran&s;criber, imagining the&s;e to be the words of Chri&s;t, in&s;erted in his copy the addi|tion "Je&s;us Chri&s;t."

His te&s;timony is remark|able only for this particular; that he relates of him&s;elf, that, travelling from Pale&s;tine to Rome, he vi&s;ited upon his journey many bi&s;hops; and that "in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and in every city, the &s;ame doctrine is taught, which the Law, and the Prophets, and the <HI>Lord</HI> teacheth." This is an important at|te&s;tation, from good authority, and of high antiquity. It is generally under&s;tood that by the word "Lord," Hege&s;ippus intended &s;ome writing or writings, containing the teaching of Chri&s;t, in which &s;en&s;e alone, the term combines with the other terms "Law and Prophets," which denote writings; and together with them admits of the verb "preacheth," in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e. Then, that the&s;e writings were &s;ome or all of the books of the New Te&s;tament, is rendered probable from hence, that, in the fragments of his works, which are pre&s;erved in Eu&s;e|bius, and in a writer of the ninth century, enough, though it be little, is left to &s;hew, that Hege&s;ippus expre&s;&s;ed divers things in the &s;tyle of the Go&s;pels, and of the Acts of

X. The evidence now opens upon us full and clear. Irenaeus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. vol. i. p. 344.</NOTE> &s;ucceeded Pothinus as bi&s;hop of Lyons.

"We have

not received," faith Irenaeus, "the know|ledge of the way of our &s;alvation by any others than tho&s;e by whom the go&s;pel has been brought to us. Which go&s;pel they fir&s;t preached, and afterwards, by the will of God, committed to writing, that it might be for time to come the foundation and pillar of our faith.&mdash;For after that our Lord ro&s;e from the dead, and they (the apo&s;tles) were endowed from above with the power of the Holy Gho&s;t coming down upon them, they received a perfect knowledge of all things. They then went forth to all the ends of the earth, declaring to men the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven|ly peace, having all of them, and every one alike, the go&s;pel of God. Matthew then, among the Jews, writ a go&s;pel in their own language, while Peter and Paul were preach|ing the go&s;pel at Rome, and founding a church there. And after their exit, Mark al&s;o, the di&s;ciple and interpreter of Peter, de|livered to us in writing the things that had been preached by Peter. And Luke, the companion of Paul, put down in a book the go&s;pel preached by him (Paul). Afterwards

<P>The corre&s;pondency, in the days of Ire|naeus, of the oral and written tradition, and the deduction of the oral tradition through various channels from the age of the apo&s;tles, which was then lately pa&s;&s;ed, and, by con|&s;equence, the probability that the books truly delivered what the apo&s;tles taught, is infer|red al&s;o with &s;trict regularity from another pa&s;&s;age of his works. "The tradition of the apo&s;tles (this Father &s;aith) hath &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole univer&s;e; and all they, who &s;earch after the &s;ources of truth, will find this tradition to be held &s;acred in every church. We might enumerate all tho&s;e who have been appointed bi&s;hops to the&s;e
<PB N="212" REF="224">
churches by the apo&s;tles, and all their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, up to our days. It is by this unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that we have received the tradition which actually exi&s;ts in the church, as al&s;o the doctrines of truth, as it was preached by the apo&s;tles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ir. in Haer. I. iii. c. 3.</NOTE>." The reader will ob&s;erve upon this, that the &s;ame Ire|naeus, who is now &s;tating the &s;trength and uniformity of the tradition, we have before &s;een, recognizing, in the fulle&s;t manner, the authority of the written records; from which we are entitled to conclude, that they were then conformable to each other.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the te&s;timony of Irenaeus in favour of our go&s;pels is <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of all others. I allude to a remarkable pa&s;&s;age in his works, in which, for &s;ome rea&s;ons &s;uf|ficiently fanciful, he endeavours to &s;how, that there could be neither more nor fewer go&s;pels than <HI>four.</HI> With his argument we have no concern. The po&s;ition it&s;elf proves that four, and only four, go&s;pels were at that
<PB N="213" REF="225">
time publicly read and acknowledged. That the&s;e were our go&s;pels, and in the &s;tate in which we now have them, is &s;hown from ma|ny other places of this writer be&s;ide that which we have already alledged. He mentions how Matthew begins his go&s;pel, how Mark begins and ends his, and their &s;uppo&s;ed rea|&s;ons for &s;o doing. He enumerates at length the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory in Luke, which are not found in any of the other evangeli&s;ts. He &s;tates the particular de&s;ign with which St. John compo&s;ed his go&s;pel, and accounts for the doctrinal de|clarations which precede the narrative.</P>
<P>To the book of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, its author and credit, the te&s;timony of Ire|naeus is no le&s;s explicit. Referring to the account of St. Paul's conver&s;ion and voca|tion, in the ninth chapter of that book, "Nor can they (&s;ays he, meaning the par|ties with whom he argues) &s;how that he is not to be credited, who has related to us the truth with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s." In ano|ther place, he has accurately collected the &s;everal
<PB N="214" REF="226">
texts, in which the writer of the hi&s;|tory is repre&s;ented as accompanying St. Paul, which leads him to deliver a &s;ummary of almo&s;t the whole of the la&s;t twelve chapters of the book.</P>
<P>In an author, thus abounding with refe|rences and allu&s;ions to the &s;criptures, there is not one to any apocryphal Chri&s;tian writ|ing whatever. This is a broad line of di&s;|tinction between our &s;acred books, and the preten&s;ions of all others.</P>
<P>The force of the te&s;timony of the pe|riod which we have con&s;idered, is greatly &s;trengthened by the ob&s;ervation, that it is the te&s;timony, and the concurring te&s;timony, of writers who lived in countries remote from one another. Clement flouri&s;hed at Rome, Ignatius at Antioch, Polycarp at Smyrna, Ju&s;tin Martyr in Syria, and Ire|naeus in France.</P>

Clement follow|ed Irenaeus at the di&s;tance of only &s;ixteen
<PB N="216" REF="228">
years, and therefore may be &s;aid to maintain the &s;eries of te&s;timony in an uninterrupted continuation.</P>
<P>In certain of Clement's works, now lo&s;t, but of which various parts are recited by Eu&s;ebius, there is given a di&s;tinct account of the order in which the four go&s;pels were written. The go&s;pels, which contain the genealogies, were (he &s;ays) written fir&s;t, Mark's next, at the in&s;tance of Peter's fol|lowers, and John's the la&s;t; and this account he tells us that he had received from Pre&s;|byters of more ancient times. This te&s;ti|mony proves the following points; that the&s;e go&s;pels were the hi&s;tories of Chri&s;t then publicly received, and relied upon; that the dates, occa&s;ions, and circum&s;tances of their publication, were at that time &s;ubjects of attention and enquiry among&s;t Chri&s;tians. In the works of Clement which remain, the four Go&s;pels are repeatedly quoted by the names of their authors, and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles is expre&s;sly a&s;cribed to Luke. In one place, after mentioning a particular circum&s;tance,
<PB N="217" REF="229">
he adds the&s;e remarkable words: "We have not this pa&s;&s;age <HI>in the four go&s;pels delivered to us,</HI> but in that according to the Egyptians;" which puts a marked di&s;tinction between the four go&s;pels and all other hi&s;to|ries, or pretended hi&s;tories, of Chri&s;t. In another part of his works, the perfect con|fidence, with which he received the go&s;pels, is &s;ignified by him in the&s;e words: "That this is true appears from hence, that it is written in the go&s;pel according to St. Luke;" and again, "I need not u&s;e many words, but only to alledge the evangelic voice of the Lord." His quotations are numerous. The &s;ayings of Chri&s;t, of which he alledges many, are all taken from our go&s;pels, the &s;ingle exception to this ob&s;ervation appearing to be a loo&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"A&s;k great things, and the &s;mall &s;hall be added unto you." Clement rather cho&s;e to expound the words of Matthew (vi. 33) than literally to cite them; and this is mo&s;t undeniably proved by another place in the &s;ame Clement, where he both produces the text and the&s;e words as an expo&s;ition:&mdash;"Seek ye fir&s;t the kingdom of heaven and its righteou&s;ne&s;s, for the&s;e are the great things but the &s;mall things, and things relating to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall be added unto you."

XII. In the age in which they lived&dagger;, Tertullian joins on with Clement. The number of the go&s;pels then received, the names of the evangeli&s;ts, and their proper de&s;criptions, are exhibited by this writer in one &s;hort &s;entence:&mdash;"Among the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> John and Matthew teach us the faith; among <HI>apo&s;tolical men,</HI> Luke and Mark re|fre&s;h it." The next pa&s;&s;age to be taken from Tertullian, affords as complete an atte&s;|tation to the authenticity of our books, as can be well imagined. After enumerating the churches which had been founded by Paul, at Corinth, in Galatia, at Philippi, The&s;&s;alonica, and Ephe&s;us; the church of Rome e&s;tabli&s;hed by Peter and Paul; and other churches derived from John; he pro|ceeds thus:&mdash;"I &s;ay then, that with them, but not with them only which are apo&s;toli|cal, but with all who have fellow&s;hip with <NOTE PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 561.</NOTE>

them in the &s;ame faith, is that go&s;pel of Luke received from its fir&s;t publication, which we &s;o zealou&s;ly maintain:" and pre|&s;ently afterwards adds &punc; "The &s;ame autho|rity of the apo&s;tolical churches will &s;upport the other go&s;pels, which we have from them, and according to them, I mean John's and Matthew's, although that likewi&s;e, which Mark publi&s;hed, may be &s;aid to be Peter's, who&s;e interpreter Mark was." In another place Tertullian affirms, that the three other go&s;pels were in the hands of the churches from the beginning, as well as Luke's. This noble te&s;timony &s;ixes the univer&s;ality with which the go&s;pels were received, and their antiquity; that they were in the hands of all, and had been &s;o from the fir&s;t. And this evidence appears not more than one hundred and fifty years after the publication of the books. The reader mu&s;t be given to under&s;tand that, when Tertullian &s;peaks of maintaining or defending <HI>(tuendi)</HI> the Go|&s;pel of St. Luke, he only means maintaining or defending the integrity of the copies of Luke received by Chri&s;tian churches, in oppo&s;ition
<PB N="220" REF="232">

<P>This author frequently cites the Acts of the Apo&s;tles under that title, once calls it Luke's commentary, and ob&s;erves how St. Paul's epi&s;tles confirm it.</P>
<P>After this general evidence, it is unnece&s;|&s;ary to add particular quotations. The&s;e, however, are &s;o numerous and ample, as to have led Dr. Lardner to ob&s;erve, "that there are more, and larger, quotations of the &s;mall volume of the New Te&s;tament in this one Chri&s;tian author, than there are of all the works of Cicero in writers of all characters for &s;everal ages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. vol. ii. p. 647.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Tertullian quotes no Chri&s;tian writing as of equal authority with the &s;criptures, and no &s;purious book at all; a broad line of di&s;|tinction, we may once more ob&s;erve, between our &s;acred books and all others.</P>

We may again likewi&s;e remark the wide extent through which the reputation of the Go&s;pels, and of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, had &s;pread, and the perfect con&s;ent in this point of di&s;tant and independent &s;ocieties. It is now only about one hundred and fifty years &s;ince Chri&s;t was crucified; and within this period, to &s;ay nothing of the apo&s;tolical Fathers who have been noticed already, we have Ju&s;tin Martyr at Neapolis, Theophilus at Antioch, Irenaeus in France, Clement at Alexandria, Tertullian at Carthage, quoting the &s;ame books of hi&s;torical &s;criptures, and, I may &s;ay, quoting the&s;e alone.</P>

Nothing can be more peremptory upon the &s;ubject now under con&s;ideration, and, from a writer of his learning and information, more &s;ati&s;|factory, than the declaration of Origen, pre|&s;erved, in an extract from his works, by Eu&s;ebius; "That the four go&s;pels alone, are received without di&s;pute, by the whole church of God under heaven:" to which declaration is immediately &s;ubjoined a brief hi&s;tory of the re&s;pective authors, to whom they were then, as they are now, a&s;cribed. The language holden concerning the go&s;pels throughout the works of Origen which remain, entirely corre&s;pond with the te&s;ti|mony here cited. His atte&s;tation to the Acts of the Apo&s;tles is no le&s;s po&s;itive: "And Luke al&s;o once more &s;ounds the trumpet relating the acts of the Apo&s;tles." The
<PB N="223" REF="235">
univer&s;ality with which the &s;criptures were then read, is well &s;ignified by this writer, in a pa&s;&s;age in which he has occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve again&s;t Cel&s;us, "That it is not in any private books, or &s;uch as are read by a few only, and tho&s;e &s;tudious per&s;ons, but in books read by every body, that it is written, the invi&s;ible things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by things that are made." It is to no purpo&s;e to &s;ingle out quotations of &s;cripture from &s;uch a writer as this. We might as well make a &s;election of the quotations of &s;cripture in Dr. Clark's &s;ermons. They are &s;o thickly &s;own in the works of Origen, that Dr. Mill &s;ays, "If we had all his works remaining, we &s;hould have before us almo&s;t the whole text of the Bible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mill. proleg. cap. vi. p. 66.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Origen notices, in order to cen&s;ure, certain apocryphal go&s;pels. He al&s;o u&s;es four writ|ings of this &s;ort; that is, throughout his large works he once or twice, at the mo&s;t, quotes

<PB N="228" REF="240">
who had read many which are now lo&s;t. In a pa&s;&s;age of his evangelical demon&s;tration, Eu&s;ebius remarks, with great nicety, the delicacy of two of the evangeli&s;ts, in their manner of noticing any circum&s;tance which regarded them&s;elves, and of Mark, as writing under Peter's direction, in the circum&s;tances which regarded him. The illu&s;tration of this remark leads him to bring together long quotations from each of the evangeli&s;ts; and the whole pa&s;&s;age is a proof, that Eu&s;ebius, and the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e days, not only read the go&s;pels, but &s;tudied them with at|tention and exactne&s;s. In a pa&s;&s;age of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, he treats, in form, and at large, of the occa&s;ions of writing the four go&s;pels, and of the order in which they were written. The title of the chapter is "Of the Order of the Go&s;pels;" and it begins thus: "Let us ob&s;erve the writings of this apo&s;tle John, which are not contra|dicted by any, and, fir&s;t of all, mu&s;t be men|tioned, as acknowledged by all, the go&s;pel according to him, well known to all the churches under heaven; and that it has been
<PB N="229" REF="241">
ju&s;tly placed by the ancients the fourth in order, and after the other three, may be made evident in this manner." Eu&s;ebius then proceeds to &s;hew that John wrote the la&s;t of the four, and that his go&s;pel was in|tended to &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ions of the others; e&s;pecially in the part of our Lord's mini&s;try, which took place before the impri&s;onment of John the Bapti&s;t. He ob&s;erves, "that the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t were not &s;tudious of the ornaments of compo&s;ition, nor indeed for|ward to write at all, being wholly occupied with their mini&s;try."</P>
<P>This learned author makes no u&s;e at all of Chri&s;tian writings, forged with the names of Chri&s;t's apo&s;tles, or their companions.</P>
<P>We clo&s;e this branch of our evidence here; becau&s;e, after Eu&s;ebius, there is no room for any que&s;tion upon the &s;ubject; the works of Chri&s;tian writers being as full of texts of &s;cripture, and of references to &s;cripture, as the di&s;cour&s;es of modern divines.

<P>IGNATIUS, who was bi&s;hop of Antioch within forty years after the a&s;cen&s;ion, and who had lived and conver&s;ed with the apo&s;tles, &s;peaks of the go&s;pel and of the apo|&s;tles, in terms which render it very probable, that he meant by the go&s;pel, the book or volume of the Go&s;pels, and by the apo&s;tles, the book or volume of their Epi&s;tles. His words in one place are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. Cred. pt. ii. vol. i. p. 180.</NOTE>, "fleeing to the Go&s;pel as the fle&s;h of Je&s;us, and to the Apo&s;tles as the pre&s;bytery of the church;" that is, as Le Clerc interprets them, "in order to under&s;tand the will of God, he fled to the go&s;pels, which he believed no le&s;s than if Chri&s;t in the fle&s;h had been &s;peak|ing to him; and to the writings of the
<PB N="240" REF="252">
apo&s;tles, whom he e&s;teemed as the pre&s;bytery of the whole Chri&s;tian church." It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that about eighty years after this we have direct proof, in the writings of Clement of Alexandria <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. ii. p. 516.</NOTE>, that the&s;e two names, "Go&s;pel" and "Apo&s;tles," were the names by which the writings of the New Te&s;tament, and the divi&s;ion of the&s;e writ|ings, were u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age from Ignatius is the fol|lowing:&mdash;"But the Go&s;pel has &s;omewhat in it more excellent, the appearance of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his pa&s;&s;ion, and re&s;ur|rection <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 182.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>And a third, "Ye ought to hearken to the Prophets, but e&s;pecially to the Go&s;pel, in which the pa&s;&s;ion has been manife&s;ted to us, and the re&s;urrection perfected." In this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age the prophets and the go&s;pel are put in conjunction; and as Ignatius undoubtedly meant by the Prophets a collection of writings,
<PB N="241" REF="253">
it is probable that he meant the &s;ame by the Go&s;pel, the two terms &s;tanding in evident paralleli&s;m with each other.</P>
<P>This interpretation of the word "go&s;pel" in the pa&s;&s;ages above quoted from Ignatius, is confirmed by a piece of nearly equal anti|quity, the relation of the martyrdom of Polycarp by the church of Smyrna. "All things," &s;ay they, "that went before were done, that the Lord might &s;hew us a martyr|dom according to the go&s;pel, for he expected to be delivered up as the Lord al&s;o did <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ig.

In both the&s;e places, what is called <HI>the go&s;pel</HI> &s;eems to be the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his doctrine.</P>
<P>If this be the true &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ages, they are not only evidences of our propo&s;i|tion, but &s;trong, and very ancient proofs
<PB N="242" REF="254">
of the high e&s;teem in which the books of the New Te&s;tament were holden.</P>
<P N="2">II. Eu&s;ebius relates, that Quadratus and &s;ome others, who were the immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of the apo&s;tles, travelling abroad to preach Chri&s;t, carried the go&s;pels with them, and delivered them to their converts. The words of Eu&s;ebius are: "Then travelling abroad, they performed the work of evan|geli&s;ts, being ambitious to preach Chri&s;t, and <HI>deliver the &s;cripture of the divine go&s;pels</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard.

What is thus recorded of the go&s;pels took place with|in &s;ixty, or at the mo&s;t &s;eventy, years after they were publi&s;hed: and it is evident, that they mu&s;t, before this time (and, it is pro|bable, long before this time), have been in general u&s;e, and in high e&s;teem in the

Eu&s;ebius records of Origen, and cites for his authority the letters of Bi&s;hops contemporary with Origen, that, when he went into Pale&s;tine about the year 216, which was only 16 years after the date of Tertullian's te&s;timony, he was de&s;ired by the Bi&s;hops of that country to di&s;cour&s;e and ex|pound the &s;criptures publicly in the church; though he was not yet ordained a pre&s;byter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. iii. p. 68.</NOTE>.

Origen al&s;o him&s;elf bears witne&s;s to the &s;ame practice: "This (&s;ays he) we do, when the &s;criptures are read in the church, and when the di&s;cour&s;e for explication is delivered to the people <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 302.</NOTE>."

<P N="5">V. Intimations of the &s;ame cu&s;tom may be traced in a great number of writers in the beginning and throughout the whole of the fourth century. Of the&s;e te&s;timonies I will only u&s;e one, as being, of it&s;elf, expre&s;s and full. Augu&s;tine, who appeared near the conclu&s;ion of the century, di&s;plays the benefit of the Chri&s;tian religion on this very account, the public reading of the &s;criptures in the churches, "where (&s;ays he) is a confluence
<PB N="256" REF="268">
of all &s;orts of people of both &s;exes, and where they hear how they ought to live well in this world, that they may de&s;erve to live happily and eternally in another." And this cu&s;tom he declares to be univer&s;al: "The canonical books of &s;cripture being read every where, the miracles therein re|corded are well known to all people <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. x. p. 276 et &s;eq.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It does not appear that any books, other than our pre&s;ent &s;criptures, were thus pub|licly read, except that the epi&s;tle of Clement was read in the church of Corinth, to which it had been addre&s;&s;ed, and in &s;ome others; and that the Shepherd of Hermas was read in many churches. Nor does it &s;ubtract much from the value of the argument, that the&s;e two writings partly come within it, becau&s;e we allow them to be the genuine writings of apo&s;tolical men. There is not the lea&s;t evidence, that any other go&s;pel, than the four which we receive, was ever admitted to this di&s;tinction.</P>

of &s;hewing the &s;entiments and &s;tudies of learned Chri&s;tians of that age, to notice the following:</P>
<P>Eu&s;ebius, in the very beginning of the century, wrote expre&s;sly upon the di&s;cre|pancies ob&s;ervable in the go&s;pels, and like|wi&s;e a treati&s;e, in which he pointed out what things are related by four, what by three, what by two, and what by one evangeli&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. viii. p. 46.</NOTE>. This author al&s;o te&s;tifies, what is certainly a material piece of evidence, "that the writ|ings of the apo&s;tles had obtained &s;uch an e&s;teem, as to be tran&s;lated into every lan|guage both of Greeks and Barbarians, and to be diligently &s;tudied by all nations <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 201.</NOTE>."

<P>Dama&s;us, bi&s;hop of Rome, corre&s;ponded with St. Jerome upon the expo&s;ition of dif|ficult texts of &s;cripture; and, in a letter &s;till
<PB N="264" REF="276">

This la&s;t clau&s;e &s;hews the number and va|riety of commentaries then extant.</P>
<P>Gregory of Ny&s;&s;en, at one time, appeals to the mo&s;t exact copies of St. Mark's go&s;|pel; at another time, compares together, and propo&s;es to reconcile, the &s;everal accounts of the re&s;urrection <HI>given by the four evangeli&s;ts;</HI> which limitation proves, that there were no other hi&s;tories of Chri&s;t deemed authentic be&s;ide the&s;e, or included in the &s;ame cha|racter with the&s;e. This writer ob&s;erves, acutely enough, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the clothes in the &s;epulchre, the naplkin that was about our Saviour's head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it&s;elf, did not be&s;peak the terror

<P>Ambro&s;e, bi&s;hop of Milan, remarked va|rious readings in the Latin copies of the New Te&s;tament, and appeals to the original Greek;</P>
<P>And Jerome, towards the conclu&s;ion of this century, put forth an edition of the New Te&s;tament in Latin, corrected, at lea&s;t as to the go&s;pels, by Greek copies, "and tho&s;e (he &s;ays) ancient."</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Chry&s;o&s;tom, it is well known, de|livered and publi&s;hed a great many homilies, or &s;ermons, upon the Go&s;pels and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to bring down this article lower; but it is of importance to add, that there is no example of Chri&s;tian writers of the three fir&s;t centuries compo&s;ing comments
<PB N="266" REF="278">
upon any other books than tho&s;e which are found in the New Te&s;tament, except the &s;ingle one, of Clement of Alexandria, com|menting upon a book called the Revelation of Peter.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>ancient ver&s;ions</HI> of the New Te&s;ta|ment, one of the mo&s;t valuable is the Syriac. Syriac was the language of Pale&s;tine when Chri&s;tianity was there fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. And although the books of &s;cripture were writ|ten in Greek, for the purpo&s;e of a more ex|tended circulation than within the precincts of Judea, yet it is probable that they would &s;oon be tran&s;lated into the vulgar language of the country where the religion fir&s;t pre|vailed. Accordingly a Syriac tran&s;lation is now extant, all along, &s;o far as it appears, u&s;ed by the inhabitants of Syria, bearing many internal marks of high antiquity, &s;up|ported in its preten&s;ions by the uniform tra|dition of the Ea&s;t, and confirmed by the di&s;covery of many very ancient manu&s;cripts in the libraries of Europe. It is about 200 years &s;ince a Bi&s;hop of Antioch &s;ent a copy
<PB N="267" REF="279">
of this tran&s;lation into Europe, to be print|ed; and this &s;eems to be the fir&s;t time that the tran&s;lation became generally known to the&s;e parts of the world. The Bi&s;hop of Antioch's te&s;tament was found to contain all our books, except the &s;econd epi&s;tle of Pe|ter, the &s;econd and third of John, and the Revelation; which books, however, have &s;ince been di&s;covered in that language in &s;ome ancient manu&s;cripts of Europe. But in this collection, no other book, be&s;ide what is in ours, appears ever to have had a place. And, which is very worthy of ob&s;ervation, the text, though pre&s;erved in a remote coun|try, and without communication with ours, differs from ours very little, and in nothing that is important <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jones on the Canon, vol. i. c. xiv.</NOTE>.</P>

<P N="2">II.

&s;aying that Clement, who was bi&s;hop of Rome, wrote this epi&s;tle; others, that it was Luke, the &s;ame who writ the Go&s;pel and the Acts."

<P N="4">IV. But this &s;ection may be &s;aid to have been framed on purpo&s;e to introduce to the reader two remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, extant in Eu&s;ebius's eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory. The fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age opens with the&s;e words&mdash;"Let us ob&s;erve the writings of the apo&s;tle John, which are <HI>uncontradicted;</HI> and, fir&s;t of all, mu&s;t be mentioned, as acknowledged of all, the go&s;pel according to him, well known to all the churches under heaven." The author then proceeds to relate the occa&s;ions of writing the go&s;pels, and the rea&s;ons for pla|cing St. John's the la&s;t, manife&s;tly &s;peaking of all the four as parallel in their authority, and in the certainty of their original <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. viii. p. 90.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="287" REF="299">
&s;econd pa&s;&s;age is taken from a chapter, the title of which is, "Of the Scriptures <HI>univer|&s;ally acknowledged,</HI> and of tho&s;e that are not &s;uch." Eu&s;ebius begins his enumeration in the following manner:&mdash;"<HI>In the fir&s;t place,</HI> are to be ranked the &s;acred four Go&s;pels, then the book of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, after that are to be reckoned the Epi&s;tles of Paul. In the next place, that called the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of John, and the Epi&s;tle of Peter, are to be e&s;|teemed authentic. After this is to be placed, if it be thought fit, the Revelation of John, about which we &s;hall ob&s;erve the different opinions at proper &s;ea&s;ons. Of the contro|verted, but yet well known, or approved by the mo&s;t, are that called the Epi&s;tle of James, and that of Jude, and the &s;econd of Peter, and the &s;econd and third of John, whether they are written by the evangeli&s;t, or another of the &s;ame name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. viii. p. 89.</NOTE>." He then proceeds to reckon up five others, not in our canon, which he calls in one place <HI>&s;purious,</HI> in another
<PB N="288" REF="300">
<HI>controverted,</HI> meaning, as appears to me; nearly the &s;ame thing by the&s;e two words <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That Eu&s;ebius could not intend, by the word ren|dered "&s;purious," what we at pre&s;ent mean by it, is evident from a clau&s;e in this very chapter, where, &s;peak|ing of the Go&s;pels of Peter and Thomas, and Matthias and &s;ome others, he &s;ays, "They are not &s;o much as to be reckoned among the <HI>&s;purious,</HI> but are to be rejected as altogether ab&s;urd and impious." Vol. viii. p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t from this pa&s;&s;age, that the four Go&s;pels, and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, (the parts of &s;cripture with which our con|cern principally lies) were acknowledged without di&s;pute, even by tho&s;e who rai&s;ed objections, or entertained doubts, about &s;ome other parts of the &s;ame collection. But the pa&s;&s;age proves &s;omething more than this. The author was extremely conver&s;ant in the writings of Chri&s;tians, which had been pub|li&s;hed from the commencement of the in&s;ti|tution to his own time; and it was from the&s;e writings that he drew his knowledge of the character and reception of the books in que&s;tion. That Eu&s;ebius recurred to this
<PB N="289" REF="301">
medium of information, and that he had examined with attention this &s;pecies of proof, is &s;hewn, fir&s;t, by a pa&s;&s;age in the very chap|ter we are quoting, in which, &s;peaking of the books which he calls &s;purious, "None (he &s;ays) of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tles, have vouch&s;afed to make any mention of them in their writ|ings;" and &s;econdly, by another pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame work, wherein, &s;peaking of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle of Peter, "This (he &s;ays) the pre&s;byters of ancient times have quoted in their writings as undoubtedly genuine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 99.</NOTE>;" and then, &s;peaking of &s;ome other writings bearing the name of Peter, "We know (he &s;ays) that they have not been delivered down to us in the number of catholic writ|ings, fora&s;much as no eccle&s;ia&s;tical writer of the ancients, or of our times, has made u&s;e of te&s;timonies out of them." "But in the progre&s;s of this hi&s;tory," the author pro|ceeds, "we &s;hall make it our bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew, together with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions from the
<PB N="290" REF="302">
apo&s;tles, what eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers, in every age, have u&s;ed &s;uch writings as the&s;e which are contradicted, and what they have &s;aid, with regard to the &s;criptures received in the New Te&s;tament, <HI>and acknowledged by all,</HI> and with regard to tho&s;e which are not &s;uch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 111.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>After this it is rea&s;onable to believe, that, when Eu&s;ebius &s;tates the four Go&s;pels, and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, as uncontradicted, unconte&s;ted, and acknowledged by all; and when he places them in oppo&s;ition, not only to tho&s;e which were &s;purious in our &s;en&s;e of that term, but to tho&s;e which were con|troverted, and even to tho&s;e which were well known and approved by many, yet doubted of by &s;ome; he repre&s;ents, not only the &s;en&s;e of his own age, but the re&s;ult of the evidence, which the writings of prior ages, from the apo&s;tle's time to his own, had furni&s;hed to his enquiries. The opinion of Eu&s;ebius and his contemporaries, appears to have been founded upon the te&s;timony of writers,
<PB N="291" REF="303">
whom they <HI>then</HI> called ancient; and we may ob&s;erve, that &s;uch of the works of the&s;e writers, as have come down to our times, entirely con&s;irm the judgement, and &s;upport the di&s;tinction which Eu&s;ebius propo&s;es. The books, which he calls "books univer|&s;ally acknowledged," are in fact u&s;ed and quoted, in the remaining works of Chri&s;tian writers, during the 250 years between the apo&s;tle's time and that of Eu&s;ebius, much more frequently than, and in a different manner from, tho&s;e, the authority of which, he tells us, was di&s;puted.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our hi&s;torical &s;criptures were attacked by the early adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity, as contain|ing the accounts upon which the religion was founded.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. NEAR the middle of the &s;econd cen|tury, Cel&s;us, a heathen philo&s;opher, wrote a profe&s;&s;ed treati&s;e again&s;t Chri&s;tianity. To this treati&s;e, Origen, who came about fifty years after him, publi&s;hed an an&s;wer, in which he frequently recites his adver&s;ary's words and arguments. The work of Cel&s;us is lo&s;t; but that of Origen remains. Origen appears to have given us the words of Cel&s;us, where he profe&s;&s;es to give them, very faith|fully; and, among&s;t other rea&s;ons for think|ing &s;o, this is one, that the objection, as &s;tated by him from Cel&s;us, is &s;ometimes &s;tronger than his own an&s;wer. I think it al&s;o pro|bable that Origen, in his an&s;wer, has retailed
<PB N="293" REF="305">
a large portion of the work of Cel&s;us: "That it may not be &s;u&s;pected (he &s;ays) that we pa&s;s by any chapters, becau&s;e we have no an&s;wers at hand, I have thought it be&s;t, according to my ability, to confute every thing propo&s;ed by him, not &s;o much ob&s;erv|ing the natural order of things, as the order which he has taken him&s;elf <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or. cont.

<P>Cel&s;us wrote about 100 years after the Go&s;pels were publi&s;hed; and therefore any notices of the&s;e books from him are ex|tremely important for their antiquity. They are, however, rendered more &s;o by the cha|racter of the author; for the reception, credit, and notoriety of the&s;e books mu&s;t have been well e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t Chri&s;tians, to have made them &s;ubjects of animadver&s;ion and oppo&s;ition by &s;trangers and by enemies. It evinces the truth of what Chry&s;o&s;tom, two centuries afterwards, ob&s;erved, that "the Go&s;pels, when written, were not hid in a corner, or buried in ob&s;curity, but they were
<PB N="294" REF="306">
made known to all the world, before ene|mies as well as others, even as they are now <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Mat. hom. i. 7.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="1">1. Cel&s;us, or the Jew whom he per&s;onates, u&s;es the&s;e words&mdash;"I could &s;ay many things concerning the affairs of Je&s;us, and tho&s;e, too, different from tho&s;e written by the di&s;|ciples of Je&s;us, but I purpo&s;ely omit them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lardner's Jewi&s;h and Heathen Te&s;tim. vol. ii. p. 274.</NOTE>." Upon this pa&s;&s;age it has been rightly ob|&s;erved, that it is not ea&s;y to believe, that if Cel&s;us could have contradicted the di&s;ciples upon good evidence in any material point, he would have omitted to do &s;o; and that the a&s;&s;ertion is, what Origen calls it, a mere oratorical flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient however to prove, that, in the time of Cel&s;us, there were books well known, and allowed to be written by the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us, which books contained a hi&s;tory of him. By the term <HI>di&s;ciple,</HI> Cel&s;us
<PB N="295" REF="307">
does not mean the followers of Je&s;us in general, for them he calls Chri&s;tians, or be|lievers, or the like, but tho&s;e who had been taught by Je&s;us him&s;elf, <HI>i. e.</HI> his apo&s;tles and companions.</P>
<P N="2">2. In another pa&s;&s;age, Cel&s;us accu&s;es the Chri&s;tians of altering the go&s;pel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 275.</NOTE>. The accu&s;ation refers to &s;ome variations in the readings of particular pa&s;&s;ages; for Cel&s;us goes on to object, that when they are pre&s;&s;ed hard, and one reading has been confuted, they di&s;own that, and fly to another. We cannot perceive from Origen that Cel&s;us &s;pe|cified any particular in&s;tances, and without &s;uch &s;pecification the charge is of no value. But the true conclu&s;ion to be drawn from it is, that there were in the hands of the Chri&s;|tians, hi&s;tories, which were even then of &s;ome &s;tanding; for various readings and corruptions do not take place in recent pro|ductions.</P>
<P>The former quotation, the reader will

<P N="3">3. In a third pa&s;&s;age, the Jew, whom Cel&s;us introduces, &s;huts up an argument in this manner:&mdash;"The&s;e things then we have alledged to you out of <HI>your own writings,</HI> not needing any other weapons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 276.</NOTE>." It is mani&s;e&s;t that this boa&s;t proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the books, over which the writer affects to triumph, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an autho|rity, by which Chri&s;tians confe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to be bound.</P>

the&s;e go&s;pels; of the precepts, Re&s;i&s;t not him that injures you, and, If a man &s;trike thee on the one cheek, offer to him the other al&s;o <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 276.</NOTE>; of the woes denounced by Chri&s;t; of his pre|dictions; of his &s;aying that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;erve two ma&s;ters <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 277.</NOTE>; of the purple robe, the crown of thorns, and the reed in his hand; of the blood that flowed from the body of Je&s;us upon the cro&s;s <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 280, 281.</NOTE>, which cir|cum&s;tance is recorded by John alone; and (what is in&s;tar omnium for the purpo&s;e for which we produce it) of the difference in the accounts given of the re&s;urrection by the evangeli&s;ts, &s;ome mentioning two angels at the &s;epulchre, others only one <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 282.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is extremely material to remark, that Cel&s;us not only perpetually referred to the accounts of Chri&s;t contained in the four Go&s;pels <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The particulars, of which the above are only a few, are well collected by Mr. Bryant, p. 140.</NOTE>, but that he referred to no other accounts; that he founded none of his objections

to Chri&s;tianity upon any thing deli|vered in &s;purious go&s;pels.</P>
<P N="2">II. What Cel&s;us was in the &s;econd cen|tury, Porphyry became in the third. His work, which was a large and formal treati&s;e again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion, is not extant. We mu&s;t be content therefore to gather his objections from Chri&s;tian writers, who have noticed in order to an&s;wer them: and enough remains of this &s;pecies of information, to prove completely, that Porphyry's animad|ver&s;ions were directed again&s;t the contents of our pre&s;ent Go&s;pels, and of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles; Porphyry con&s;idering that to overthrow <HI>them</HI> was to overthrow the reli|gion. Thus he objects to the repetition of a generation in St. Matthew's genealogy; to Matthew's call; to the quotation of a text from I&s;aiah, which is found in a p&s;alm a&s;cribed to A&s;aph; to the calling of the lake of Tiberias a &s;ea; to the expre&s;&s;ion in St. Matthew, "the abomination of de&s;olation;" to the variation in Matthew and Mark upon the text "the voice of one crying in the
<PB N="299" REF="311">
wilderne&s;s," Matthew citing it from I&s;aias, Mark from the prophets; to John's applica|tion of the term "Word;" to Chri&s;t's change of intention about going up to the fea&s;t of tabernacles (John vii. 8); to the judgement denounced by St. Peter upon Ananias and Sapphira, which he calls an imprecation of death <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jewi&s;h and Heathen Te&s;t. vol. iii. p. 166 et &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances here alledged &s;erve, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to &s;hew the nature of Porphyry's objections, and prove that Porphyry had read the Go&s;pels with that &s;ort of attention, which a writer would employ, who regarded them as the depo&s;itaries of the religion which he attacked. Be&s;ide the&s;e &s;pecifications, there exi&s;ts in the writings of ancient Chri&s;|tians general evidence, that the places of &s;cripture, upon which Porphyry had re|marked, were v ey numerous.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the above cited examples, Por|phyry, &s;peaking of St. Matthew, calls him
<PB N="300" REF="312">
<HI>your evangeli&s;t;</HI> he al&s;o u&s;es the term Evan|geli&s;ts in the plural number. What was &s;aid of Cel&s;us is true likewi&s;e of Porphyry, that it does not appear that he con&s;idered any hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t, except the&s;e, as having authority with Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="3">III. A third great writer again&s;t the Chri&s;|tian religion was the Emperor Julian, who&s;e work was compo&s;ed about a century after that of Porphyry.</P>
<P>In various long extracts, tran&s;cribed from this work by Cyril and Jerome, it appears <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. iv. p. 77 et &s;eq.</NOTE>, that Julian noticed <HI>by name</HI> Matthew and Luke, in the difference between their genea|logies of Chri&s;t; that he objected to Mat|thew's application of the prophecy, "Out of Egypt have I called my &s;on" (ii. 15), and to that of "a virgin &s;hall conceive" (i. 22); that he recited &s;ayings of Chri&s;t, and va|rious pa&s;&s;ages of his hi&s;tory, in the very words of the evangeli&s;ts; in particular, that
<PB N="301" REF="313">
Je&s;us healed lame and blind people, and ex|orci&s;ed demoniacs, in the villages of Beth|&s;aida and Bethany; that he alledged that none of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples a&s;cribed to him the creation of the world, except John; that neither Paul, nor Matthew, nor Luke, nor Mark, have dared to call Je&s;us, God; that John wrote later than the other evangeli&s;ts, and at a time when a great number of men in the cities of Greece and Italy were convert|ed; that he alludes to the conver&s;ion of Cor|nelius and of Sergius Paulus, to Peter's vi|&s;ion, to the circular letter &s;ent by the apo&s;tles and elders at Jeru&s;alem, which are all re|corded in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles: by which quoting of the four Go&s;pels and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and by quoting no other, Julian &s;hews that the&s;e were the hi&s;torical books, and the only hi&s;torical books, received by Chri&s;tians as of authority, and as the authen|tic memoirs of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of his apo&s;tles, and of the doctrines taught by them. But Julian's te&s;timony does &s;omething more than repre&s;ent the judgement of the Chri&s;tian church in his time. It di&s;covers al&s;o his
<PB N="302" REF="314">
own. He him&s;elf expre&s;sly &s;tates the early date of the&s;e records: he calls them by the names which they now bear. He all along &s;uppo&s;es, he nowhere attempts to que&s;tion, their genuinene&s;s.</P>
<P>The argument in favour of the books of the New Te&s;tament, drawn from the notice taken of their contents by the early writers again&s;t the religion, is very con&s;iderable. It proves that the accounts, which Chri&s;tians had then, were the accounts which we have now; that our pre&s;ent &s;criptures were theirs. It proves, moreover, that neither Cel&s;us in the &s;econd, Porphyry in the third, nor Julian in the fourth century, &s;u&s;pected the authenticity of the&s;e books, or ever in&s;inuat|ed that Chri&s;tians were mi&s;taken in the au|thors to whom they a&s;cribed them. Not one of them expre&s;&s;ed an opinion upon this &s;ubject different from that which was held by Chri&s;tians. And when we con&s;ider how much it would have availed them to have ca&s;t a doubt upon this point, if they could; and how ready they &s;hewed them&s;elves to
<PB N="303" REF="315">
be, to take every advantage in their power; and that they were all men of learning and enquiry; their conce&s;&s;ion, or rather their &s;uffrage, upon the &s;ubject, is extremely valu|able.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of Porphyry, it is made &s;till &s;tronger, by the con&s;ideration that he did in fact &s;upport him&s;elf by this &s;pecies of objection, when he &s;aw any room for it, or when his acutene&s;s could &s;upply any pre|tence for alledging it. The prophecy of Daniel he attacked upon this very ground of &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s, in&s;i&s;ting that it was written after the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and maintains his charge of forgery by &s;ome, far-fetched indeed, but very &s;ubtle critici&s;ms. Concerning the writings of the New Te&s;ta|ment, no trace of this &s;u&s;picion is anywhere to be &s;ound in him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Michaelis's Introduction to the New Te&s;tament, vol. i. p. 43.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The&s;e propo&s;itions cannot be predicated of any of tho&s;e books, which are commonly called apocryphal books of the New Te&s;ta|ment.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not know that the objection taken from apocryphal writings is at pre&s;ent much relied upon by &s;cholars. But there are many, who, hearing that various go&s;pels exi&s;ted in ancient times under the names of the apo&s;tles, may have taken up a notion, that the &s;election of our pre&s;ent go&s;pels from the re&s;t, was rather an arbitrary or acciden|tal choice, than founded in any clear and certain cau&s;e of preference. To the&s;e it may be very u&s;eful to know the truth of the ca&s;e. I ob&s;erve therefore,</P>
<P N="1">I. That, be&s;ide our Go&s;pels and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, no Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, claiming
<PB N="310" REF="322">
to be written by an apo&s;tle or apo&s;toli|cal man, is quoted within three hundred years after the birth of Chri&s;t, by any writer now extant, or known; or, if quoted, is not quoted with marks of cen&s;ure and rejec|tion.</P>
<P>I have not advanced this a&s;&s;ertion with|out enquiry: and I doubt not, but that the pa&s;&s;ages cited by Mr. Jones and Dr. Lard|ner, under the &s;everal titles which the apo|cryphal books bear; or a reference to the places where they are mentioned, as collect|ed in a very accurate table, publi&s;hed in the year 1773 by the Rev. J. Atkin&s;on; will make out the truth of the propo&s;ition to the &s;atisfaction of every fair and competent judg|ment. If there be any book which may &s;eem to form an exception to the ob&s;erva|tion, it is a Hebrew Go&s;pel, which was cir|culated under the various titles of the Go&s;pel according to the Hebrews, the Go&s;pel of the Nazarenes, of the Ebionites, &s;ometimes call|ed of the Twelve, by &s;ome a&s;cribed to St. Matthew. This Go&s;pel is <HI>once,</HI> and only
<PB N="311" REF="323">
<HI>once,</HI> cited by Clement Alexandrinus, who lived, the reader will remember, in the lat|ter part of the &s;econd century, and which &s;ame Clement quotes one or other of our four Go&s;pels in almo&s;t every page of his work. It is al&s;o twice mentioned by Ori|gen, A. D. 230; and both times with marks of diminution and di&s;credit. And this is the ground upon which the exception &s;tands. But what is &s;till more material to ob&s;erve, is, that this Go&s;pel, in the main, agreed with our pre&s;ent Go&s;pel of St. Matthew <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In applying to this Go&s;pel, what Jerome in the lat|ter end of the fourth century has mentioned of a He|brew Go&s;pel, I think it probable that we &s;ometimes con|found it with a Hebrew copy of St. Matthew's Go&s;pel, whether an original or ver&s;ion, which was then extant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now if, with this account of the apocry|phal Go&s;pels, we compare what we have read, concerning the canonical &s;criptures in the preceding &s;ections; or even recollect that general, but well-founded, a&s;&s;ertion of Dr. Lardner's, "That in the remaining works of Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria
<PB N="312" REF="324">
and Tertullian, who all lived in the two fir&s;t centuries, there are more, and larger quota|tions of the &s;mall volume of the New Te&s;ta|ment, than of all the works of Cicero, by writers of all characters, for &s;everal ages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. Cred. vol. xii. p. 53.</NOTE>;" and if to this we add, that, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of many works of the primitive times of Chri&s;tianity, we have, within the above-mentioned period, the remains of Chri&s;tian writers, who lived in Pale&s;tine, Syria, A&s;ia Minor, Egypt, the part of Africa that u&s;ed the Latin tongue, in Crete, Greece, Italy and Gaul, in all which remains, refe|rences are found to our evangeli&s;ts; I appre|hend, that we &s;hall perceive a clear and broad line of divi&s;ion, between tho&s;e writ|ings, and all others pretending to a &s;imilar authority.</P>
<P N="2">II. But be&s;ide certain <HI>hi&s;tories</HI> which a&s;|&s;umed the names of Apo&s;tles, and which were forgeries properly &s;o called, there were &s;ome other Chri&s;tian writings, in the whole or in part of an hi&s;torical nature, which,
<PB N="313" REF="325">
though not forgeries, are denominated apo|cryphal, as being of uncertain, or of no au|thority.</P>
<P>Of this &s;econd cla&s;s of writings I have found only two, which are noticed by any author of the three fir&s;t centuries, without expre&s;s terms of condemnation; and the&s;e are, the one, a book entitled the Preaching of Peter, quoted repeatedly by Clement Alexandrinus, A. D. 196; the other, a book entitled the Revelation of Peter, upon which the above-mentioned Clement Alexandrinus is &s;aid, by Eu&s;ebius, to have written notes; and which is twice cited in a work &s;till ex|tant, a&s;cribed to the &s;ame author.</P>
<P>I conceive therefore, that the propo&s;ition we have before advanced, even after it hath been &s;ubjected to every exception, of every kind, that can be alledged, &s;eparates, by a wide interval, our hi&s;torical &s;criptures, from all other writings which profe&s;s to give an account of the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="326">
We may be permitted however to add,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no evidence, that any &s;purious or apocryphal books whatever, ex|i&s;ted in the fir&s;t century of the Chri&s;tan aera; in which century all our hi&s;torical books are proved to have been extant. "There are no quotations of any &s;uch books in the apo|&s;tolical fathers, by whom I mean Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas, Ignatius and Polycarp, who&s;e writings reach from about the year of our Lord 70, to the year 108;" (and &s;ome of whom have quoted each and every one of our hi&s;torical &s;criptures) "I &s;ay this," adds Dr. Lardner, "becau&s;e I think it has been proved <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. vol. xii. p. 158.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e apocryphal writings were not read in the churches of Chri&s;tians;</P>
<P N="3">3. Were not admitted into their volume;</P>
<P N="4">4. Do not appear in their catalogues;</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="315" REF="327">
5. Were not noticed by their adver&s;aries;</P>
<P N="6">6. Were not alledged by different parties, as of authority in their controver&s;ies;</P>
<P N="7">7. Were not the &s;ubjects among&s;t them, of commentaries, ver&s;ions, collations, expo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>Finally; be&s;ide the &s;ilence of three cen|turies, or evidence, within that time, of their rejection, they were, with a con&s;ent nearly univer&s;al, reprobated by Chri&s;tian writers of &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P>Although it be made out by the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions, that the books in que&s;tion never ob|tained any degree of credit and notoriety, which can place them in competition with our &s;criptures, yet it appears from the writ|ings of the fourth century, that many &s;uch exi&s;ted in that century, and in the century preceding it. It may be difficult at this di&s;tance of time to account for their origin. Perhaps the mo&s;t probable explication is,
<PB N="316" REF="328">
that they were in general compo&s;ed with a de&s;ign of making a profit by the &s;ale. What|ever treated of the &s;ubject would find pur|cha&s;ers. It was an advantage taken of the pious curio&s;ity of unlearned Chri&s;tians. With a view to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they were many of them adapted to the particular opinions of particular &s;ects, which would naturally pro|mote their circulation among&s;t the favourers of tho&s;e opinions. After all, they were pro|bably much more ob&s;cure than we imagine. Except the Go&s;pel according to the Hebrews, there is none, of which we hear more, than the Go&s;pel of the Egyptians; yet there is good rea&s;on to believe that Clement, a pre&s;byter of Alexandria in Egypt A. D. 184, and a man of almo&s;t univer&s;al reading, had never &s;een it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jones, vol. i. p. 243.</NOTE>. A Go&s;pel according to Peter, was ano|ther of the mo&s;t ancient books of this kind; yet Serapion, bi&s;hop of Antioch, A. D. 200, had not read it, when he heard of &s;uch a book being in the hands of the Chri&s;tians of Rho&s;&s;us in Cilicia; and &s;peaks of obtaining
<PB N="317" REF="329">
a &s;ight of this Go&s;pel from &s;ome &s;ectaries who u&s;ed it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lard. Cred. vol. ii. p. 557.</NOTE>. Even of the Go&s;pel of the Hebrews, which confe&s;&s;edly &s;tands at the head of the catalogue, Jerome, at the end of the fourth century, was glad to procure a copy by the favour of the Nazareans of Berea. Nothing of this &s;ort ever happened, or could have happened, concerning our Go&s;pels.</P>
<P>One thing is ob&s;ervable of all the apocry|phal Chri&s;tian writings, viz. that they pro|ceed upon the &s;ame fundamental hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, as that which is di&s;|clo&s;ed in our &s;criptures. The mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, his power of working miracles, his communication of that power to the apo&s;tles, his pa&s;&s;ion, death and re&s;urrection, are a&s;|&s;umed or a&s;&s;erted by every one of them. The names under which &s;ome of them came forth, are the names of men of eminence in our hi&s;tories. What the&s;e books give, are not contradictions, but unauthori&s;ed additions.

<P>If there be any book of this de&s;cription, which appears to have impo&s;ed upon &s;ome con&s;iderable number of learned Chri&s;tians, it is the Sybilline oracles; but, when we reflect upon the circum&s;tances which facili|tated that impo&s;ture, we &s;hall cea&s;e to won|der either at the attempt, or its &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>THE reader will now be plea&s;ed to re|collect, that the two points which form the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, are, fir&s;t, that the founder of Chri&s;tianity, his a&s;&s;o|ciates, and immediate followers, pa&s;&s;ed their lives in labours, dangers, and &s;ufferings; &s;e|condly, that they did &s;o, in atte&s;tation of the miraculous hi&s;tory recorded in our &s;crip|tures, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of that hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The argument, by which the&s;e two pro|po&s;itions have been maintained by us, &s;tands thus:</P>
<P>No hi&s;torical fact, I apprehend, is more certain, than that the original propagators of Chri&s;tianity voluntarily &s;ubjected them&s;elves to lives of fatigue, danger, and &s;uffering, in the pro&s;ecution of their undertaking. The
<PB N="321" REF="339">
nature of the undertaking; the character of the per&s;ons employed in it; the oppo&s;ition of their tenets to the fixed opinions and ex|pectations of the country, in which they fir&s;t advanced them; their undi&s;&s;embled con|demnation of the religion of all other coun|tries; their total want of power, authority, or force, render it in the highe&s;t degree pro|bable that this mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e. The probability is increa&s;ed, by what we know of the fate of the founder of the in&s;ti|tution, who was put to death for his attempt; and by what we al&s;o know of the cruel treatment of the converts to the in&s;titution, within thirty years after its commencement: both which points are atte&s;ted by heathen writers, and being once admitted, leave it very incredible, that the primitive emi&s;&s;aries of the religion, who exerci&s;ed their mini&s;try, fir&s;t, among&s;t the people who had de&s;troyed their ma&s;ter, and, afterwards, among&s;t tho&s;e who per&s;ecuted their converts, &s;hould them|&s;elves e&s;cape with impunity, or pur&s;ue their purpo&s;e in ea&s;e and &s;afety. This probability,
<PB N="322" REF="340">
thus &s;u&s;tained by foreign te&s;timony, is advanced, I think, to hi&s;torical certainty, by the evidence of our own books; by the ac|counts of a writer, who was the companion of the per&s;ons who&s;e &s;ufferings he relates; by the letters of the per&s;ons them&s;elves; by predictions of per&s;ecutions a&s;cribed to the founder of the religion, which predictions would not have been in&s;erted in his hi&s;tory, much le&s;s have been &s;tudiou&s;ly dwelt upon, if they had not accorded with the event, and which, even if fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to him, could only have been &s;o a&s;cribed, becau&s;e the event &s;ugge&s;ted them; la&s;tly, by ince&s;|&s;ant exhortations to fortitude and patience, and by an earne&s;tne&s;s, repetition, and ur|gency upon the &s;ubject, which were unlikely to have appeared, if there had not been, at the time, &s;ome extraordinary call for the exerci&s;e of the&s;e virtues.</P>
<P>It is made out al&s;o, I think, with &s;uffi|cient evidence, that both the teachers and converts of the religion, in con&s;equence of
<PB N="323" REF="341">
their new profe&s;&s;ion, took up a new cour&s;e of life and behaviour.</P>
<P>The next great que&s;tion is, what they did this FOR. That it was <HI>for</HI> a miraculous &s;tory of &s;ome kind or other, is to my appre|hen&s;ion extremely manife&s;t; becau&s;e, as to the fundamental article, the de&s;ignation of the per&s;on, viz. that this particular per&s;on, Je&s;us of Nazareth, ought to be received as the Me&s;&s;iah, or as a me&s;&s;enger from God, they neither had, nor could have, any thing but miracles to &s;tand upon. That the exer|tions and &s;ufferings of the apo&s;tles were <HI>for</HI> the &s;tory which we have now, is proved by the con&s;ideration, that this &s;tory is tran&s;|mitted to us by two of their own number, and by two others per&s;onally connected with them; that the particularity of the narratives proves, that the writers claimed to po&s;&s;e&s;s circum&s;tantial information, that from their &s;ituation they had full opportunity of acquiring &s;uch information, that they cer|tainly, at lea&s;t, knew, what their colleagues,
<PB N="324" REF="342">
their companions, their ma&s;ters taught; that each of the&s;e books contains enough to prove the truth of the religion; that, if any one of them therefore be genuine, it is &s;uf|ficient; that the genuinene&s;s however of all of them is made out, as well by the general arguments which evince the genuinene&s;s of the mo&s;t undi&s;puted remains of antiquity, as al&s;o by peculiar and &s;pecific proofs, viz. by citations from them in writings belonging to a period immediately contiguous to that in which they were publi&s;hed; by the di&s;|tingui&s;hed regard paid by early Chri&s;tians to the authority of the&s;e books, (which re|gard was manife&s;ted by their collecting of them into a volume, appropriating to that volume titles of peculiar re&s;pect, tran&s;lating them into various languages, dige&s;ting them into harmonies, writing commentaries upon them, and, &s;till more con&s;picuou&s;ly, by the reading of them in their public a&s;&s;emblies in all parts of the world); by an univer&s;al agreement with re&s;pect to <HI>the&s;e</HI> books, whil&s;t doubts were entertained concerning &s;ome
<PB N="325" REF="343">
others; by contending &s;ects appealing to them; by the early adver&s;aries of the reli|gion not di&s;puting their genuinene&s;s, but, on the contrary, treating them as the de|po&s;itaries of the hi&s;tory upon which the religion was founded; by many formal ca|talogues of the&s;e, as of certain and autho|ritative writings, publi&s;hed in different and di&s;tant parts of the Chri&s;tian world; la&s;tly, by the ab&s;ence or defect of the above-cited topics of evidence, when applied to any other hi&s;tories of the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;trong arguments to prove, that the books actually proceeded from the authors who&s;e names they bear, (and have always borne, for there is not a particle of evidence to &s;hew that they ever went under any other); but the &s;trict genuinene&s;s of the books is perhaps more than is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of our propo&s;ition. For even &s;uppo&s;ing that, by rea&s;on of the &s;ilence of antiquity, or the lo&s;s of records, we knew not who were the writers of the four Go&s;pels,
<PB N="326" REF="344">
yet the fact, that they were received as authentic accounts of the tran&s;action upon which the religion re&s;ted, and were received as &s;uch by Chri&s;tians at or near the age of the apo&s;tles, by tho&s;e whom the apo&s;tles had taught, and by &s;ocieties which the apo&s;tles had founded; this fact, I &s;ay, con|nected with the con&s;ideration, that they are corroborative of each other's te&s;timony, and that they are further corroborated by an|other contemporary hi&s;tory, taking up the &s;tory where they had left it, and, in a nar|rative built upon that &s;tory, accounting for the ri&s;e and production of changes in the world, the effects of which &s;ub&s;i&s;t at this day; connected, moreover, with the con|firmation which they receive, from letters written by the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, which both a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame general &s;tory, and, as often as occa&s;ions lead them to do &s;o, allude to particular parts of it; and connected al&s;o with the reflection, that if the apo&s;tles de|livered any different &s;tory, it is lo&s;t, (the pre&s;ent and no other being referred to by a
<PB N="327" REF="345">
&s;eries of Chri&s;tian writers, down from their age to our own; being likewi&s;e recognized in a variety of in&s;titutions, which prevailed, early and univer&s;ally, among&s;t the di&s;ciples of the religion); and that &s;o great a change, as the oblivion of one &s;tory and the &s;ub&s;ti|tution of another, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, could not have taken place; this evidence would be deemed, I apprehend, &s;ufficient to prove concerning the&s;e books, that, who|ever were the authors of them, they exhi|bit the &s;tory which the apo&s;tles told, and for which, con&s;equently, they acted, and they &s;uffered.</P>
<P>If it be &s;o, the religion mu&s;t be true. The&s;e men could not be deceivers. By only not bearing te&s;timony, they might have avoided all their &s;ufferings, and have lived quietly. Would men in &s;uch circum&s;tances pretend to have &s;een what they never &s;aw; a&s;&s;ert facts which they had no knowledge of; go about lying, to teach virtue; and, though not only convinced of Chri&s;t's being

an impo&s;tor, but having &s;een the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his impo&s;ture in his crucifixion, yet per&s;i&s;t in carrying it on; and &s;o per&s;i&s;t, as to bring upon them&s;elves, for nothing, and with a full knowledge of the con&s;equence, enmity and hatred, danger and death?</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Our fir&s;t propo&s;ition was,</HI> "That there is &s;atisfactory evidence, that many, pretending to be original witne&s;&s;es of the Chri&s;tian mi|racles, pa&s;&s;ed their lives in labours, dangers, and &s;ufferings, voluntarily undertaken and undergone, in atte&s;tation of the accounts which they delivered, and &s;olely in con&s;e|quence of their belief of the truth of tho&s;e accounts; and that they al&s;o &s;ubmitted, from the &s;ame motive, to new rules of conduct."</HEAD>

<HI>Our &s;econd propo&s;ition, and which now re|mains to be treated of, is,</HI> "That there is <HI>NOT</HI> &s;atisfactory evidence, that per&s;ons pre|tending to be original witne&s;&s;es of any other &s;imilar miracles, have acted in the &s;ame manner, in atte&s;tation of the accounts which they delivered, and &s;olely in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of tho&s;e accounts."</HEAD>
<P>I ENTER upon this part of my argu|ment, by declaring how far my belief in miraculous accounts goes. If the reformers in the time of Wickliff, or of Luther; or tho&s;e of England, in the time of Henry the Eighth, or of Queen Mary; or the founders of our religious fects &s;ince, &s;uch as were Mr. Whitfield and Mr. We&s;ley in our own times; had undergone the life of toil and exertion, of danger and &s;ufferings, which we know that many of them did un|dergo, <HI>for</HI> a miraculous &s;tory; that is to &s;ay, if they had founded their public mini&s;|try upon the allegation of miracles wrought within their own knowledge, and upon narratives
<PB N="331" REF="349">
which could not be re&s;olved into de|lu&s;ion or mi&s;take; and i&s; it had appeared, that their conduct really had its origin in the&s;e accounts, I &s;hould have believed them. Or, to borrow an in&s;tance which will be fa|miliar to every one of my readers, if the late Mr. Howard had undertaken his la|bours and journies in atte&s;tation, and in con&s;equence of a clear and &s;en&s;ible miracle, I &s;hould have believed him al&s;o. Or, to repre&s;ent the &s;ame thing under a third &s;up|po&s;ition; if Socrates had profe&s;&s;ed to per|form public miracles at Athens; if the friends of Socrates, Phaedo, Cebes, Crito, and Simmias, together with Plato, and many of his followers, relying upon the atte&s;ta|tion which the&s;e miracles afforded to his preten&s;ions, had, at the hazard of their lives, and the certain expence of their ea&s;e and tranquillity, gone about Greece, after his death, to publi&s;h and propagate his doc|trines; and if the&s;e things had come to our knowledge, in the &s;ame way as that in which the life of Socrates is now tran&s;mitted to us, through the hands of his companions
<PB N="332" REF="350">
and di&s;ciples, that is, by writings received without doubt as theirs, from the age in which they were publi&s;hed to the pre&s;ent, I &s;hould have believed this likewi&s;e. And my belief would, in each ca&s;e, be much &s;trengthened, if the &s;ubject of the mi&s;&s;ion were of importance to the conduct and hap|pine&s;s of human life; if it te&s;tified any thing which it behoved mankind to know from &s;uch authority; if the nature of what it delivered, required the &s;ort of proof which it alledged; if the occa&s;ion was adequate to the interpo&s;ition, the end worthy of the means. In the la&s;t ca&s;e my faith would be much confirmed, if the effects of the tran&s;|action <HI>remained;</HI> more e&s;pecially, if a change had been wrought, at the time, in the opi|nion and conduct of &s;uch numbers, as to lay the foundation of an in&s;titution, and of a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines, which had &s;ince over&s;pread the greate&s;t part of the civilized world. I &s;hould have believed, I &s;ay, the te&s;timony, in the&s;e ca&s;es; yet none of them do more than come up to the apo|&s;tolic hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="351">
If any one choo&s;e to call a&s;&s;ent to this evidence credulity, it is at lea&s;t incumbent upon him to produce examples, in which the &s;ame evidence hath turned out to be fal|lacious. And this contains the preci&s;e que|&s;tion which we are now to agitate.</P>
<P>In &s;tating the compari&s;on between our evidence, and what our adver&s;aries may bring into competition with ours, we will divide the di&s;tinctions which we wi&s;h to propo&s;e into two kinds, tho&s;e which relate to the proof, and tho&s;e which relate to the miracles. Under the former head we may lay out of the ca&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">I. Such accounts of &s;upernatural events as are found only in hi&s;tories by &s;ome ages po&s;terior to the tran&s;action, and of which it is evident that the hi&s;torian could know little more than his reader. Ours is con|temporary hi&s;tory. This difference alone removes out of our way, the miraculous hi&s;tory of Pythagoras, who lived five hun|dred years before the Chri&s;tian aera, written by Porphyry and Jamblicus, who lived
<PB N="334" REF="352">
three hundred years after that aera; the pro|digies of Livy's hi&s;tory; the fables of the heroic ages; the whole of the Greek and Roman, as well as of the Gothic mytho|logy; a great part of the legendary hi&s;tory of Popi&s;h &s;aints, the very be&s;t atte&s;ted of which is extracted from the certificates that are exhibited during the proce&s;s of their ca|nonization, a ceremony which &s;eldom takes place till a century after their deaths. It applies al&s;o with con&s;iderable force to the miracles of Apollonius Tyaneus, which are contained in a &s;olitary hi&s;tory of his life, publi&s;hed by Philo&s;tratus, above a hundred years after his death; and, in which, whe|ther Philo&s;tratus had any prior account to guide him, depends upon his &s;ingle un&s;up|ported a&s;&s;ertion. Al&s;o to &s;ome of the mi|racles of the third century, e&s;pecially to one extraordinary in&s;tance, the account of Gre|gory, bi&s;hop of Neoce&s;area, called Thauma|turgus, delivered in the writings of Gregory of Ny&s;&s;en, who lived one hundred and thirty years after the &s;ubject of his panegyric.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="353">
The value of this circum&s;tance is &s;hewn to have been accurately exempli&s;ied in the hi&s;tory of Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the order of Je&s;uits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dougla&s;s's Criterion of Miracles, p. 74.</NOTE>. His life, written by a companion of his, and by one of the or|der, was publi&s;hed about fifteen years after his death. In which life, the author, &s;o far from a&s;cribing any miracles to Ignatius, in|du&s;triou&s;ly &s;tates the rea&s;ons why he was not inve&s;ted with any &s;uch power. The life was re-publi&s;hed fifteen years afterwards, with the addition of many circum&s;tances, which were the fruit, the author &s;ays, of further enquiry, and of diligent examina|tion; but &s;till with a total &s;ilence about mi|racles. When Ignatius had been dead near &s;ixty years, the Je&s;uits, conceiving a wi&s;h to have the founder of their order placed in the Roman calendar, began, as it &s;hould &s;eem, for the fir&s;t time, to attribute to him a catalogue of miracles, which could not then be di&s;tinctly di&s;proved; and which, there was in tho&s;e who governed the church, a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to admit upon the &s;len|dere&s;t proofs.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="336" REF="354">
II. We may lay out of the ca&s;e, accounts publi&s;hed in one country, of what pa&s;&s;ed in a di&s;tant country, without any proof that &s;uch accounts were known or received at home. In the ca&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, Judea, which was the &s;cene of the tran&s;action, was the center of the mi&s;&s;ion. The &s;tory was publi&s;hed in the place in which it was act|ed. The church of Chri&s;t was fir&s;t planted at Jeru&s;alem it&s;elf. With that church others corre&s;ponded. From thence the primitive teachers of the in&s;titution went forth; thi|ther they a&s;&s;embled. The church of Jeru|&s;alem, and the &s;everal churches of Judea, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the beginning, and for many ages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many eminent bi&s;hops of Jeru|&s;alem, in the three fir&s;t centuries, is di&s;tinctly pre&s;erved, as Alexander, A. D. 212, who &s;ucceeded Narci&s;&s;us, then 116 years old.</NOTE>; received al&s;o the &s;ame books, and the &s;ame accounts, as other churches did.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction di&s;po&s;es, among&s;t others, of the above-mentioned miracles of Apollo|nius Tyaneus, mo&s;t of which are related to have been performed in India, no evidence remaining that either the miracles a&s;cribed
<PB N="337" REF="355">
to him, or the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e miracles, were ever heard of in India. Tho&s;e of Francis Xavier, the Indian mi&s;&s;ionary, with many others of the Romi&s;h breviary, are liable to the &s;ame objection, viz. that the accounts of them were publi&s;hed at a va&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;cene of the wonders <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doug. Crit. p. 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">III. We lay out of the ca&s;e <HI>tran&s;ient</HI> rumours. Upon the fir&s;t publication of an extraordinary account, or even of an ar|ticle of ordinary intelligence, no one, who is not per&s;onally acquainted with the tran&s;|action, can know whether it be true or fal&s;e, becau&s;e any man may publi&s;h any &s;tory. It is in the future confirmation, or contra|diction of the account; in its permanency, or its di&s;appearance; its dying away into &s;ilence, or its increa&s;ing in notoriety; its being followed up by &s;ub&s;equent accounts, and being repeated in different and inde|pendent accounts, that &s;olid truth is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from fugitive lies. This di&s;tinction
<PB N="338" REF="356">
is altogether on the &s;ide of Chri&s;tianity. The &s;tory did not drop. On the contrary, it was &s;ucceeded by a train of action and events dependent upon it. The accounts, which we have in our hands, were compo&s;ed after the fir&s;t reports mu&s;t have &s;ub&s;ided. They were followed by a train of writings upon the &s;ubject. The hi&s;torical te&s;timonies of the tran&s;action were many and various, and connected with letters, di&s;cour&s;es, con|trover&s;ies, apologies, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively produced by the &s;ame tran&s;action.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may lay out of the ca&s;e what I call <HI>naked</HI> hi&s;tory. It has been &s;aid, that if the prodigies of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory had been found only in fragments of Manetho, or Bero&s;us, we &s;hould have paid no regard to them: and I am willing to admit this. If we knew nothing of the fact, but from the fragment; if we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no proof that the&s;e accounts had been credited and acted upon, from times, probably, as ancient as the ac|counts them&s;elves; if we had no vi&s;ible effects connected with the hi&s;tory, no &s;ub&s;equent
<PB N="339" REF="357">
or collateral te&s;timony to confirm it; under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I think that it would be unde&s;erving of credit. But this certainly is not our ca&s;e. In appreciating the evidence of Chri&s;tianity, the books are to be combined with the in&s;titution; with the prevalency of the religion at this day; with the time and place of its origin, which are acknowledged points; with the circum|&s;tances of its ri&s;e and progre&s;s, as collected from external hi&s;tory; with the fact of our pre&s;ent books being received by the votaries of the in&s;titution from the beginning; with that of other books coming after the&s;e, filled with accounts of effects and con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the tran&s;action, or referring to the tran&s;action, or built upon it; la&s;tly, with the con&s;ideration of the number and variety of the books them&s;elves, the different writers from which they proceed, the dif|ferent views with which they were written, &s;o di&s;agreeing as to repel the &s;u&s;picion of confederacy, &s;o agreeing as to &s;hew that they were founded in a common original, <HI>i. e.</HI> in a &s;tory &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame. Whether
<PB N="340" REF="358">
this proof be &s;atisfactory or not, it is properly a cumulation of evidence, by no means a naked or &s;olitary record.</P>
<P N="5">V. A mark of hi&s;torical truth, although only in a certain way, and to a certain de|gree, is <HI>particularity,</HI> in names, dates, places, circum&s;tances, and in the order of events preceding or following the tran&s;action: of which kind, for in&s;tance, is the particularity in the de&s;cription of St. Paul's voyage and &s;hipwreck, in the 27th chapter of the Acts, which no man, I think, can read without being convinced that the writer was there; and al&s;o in the account of the cure and exa|mination of the blind man, in the ninth chapter of St. John's Go&s;pel, which bears every mark of per&s;onal knowledge on the part of the hi&s;torian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Both the&s;e chapters ought to be read for the &s;ake of this very ob&s;ervation.</NOTE>. I do not deny that fiction has often the particularity of truth; but then it is of &s;tudied and elaborate fiction, or of a formal attempt to deceive, that we ob&s;erve this. Since, however, experience
<PB N="341" REF="359">
proves that particularity is not con&s;ined to truth, I have &s;tated that it is a proof of truth only to a certain extent, <HI>i. e.</HI> it reduces the que&s;tion to this, whether we can depend or not upon the <HI>probity</HI> of the relator; which is a con&s;iderable advance in our pre&s;ent argu|ment, for an expre&s;s attempt to deceive, in which ca&s;e alone particularity can appear without truth, is charged upon the evange|li&s;ts by few. If the hi&s;torian acknowledge him&s;elf to have received his intelligence from others, the particularity of the nar|rative &s;hews, prim&acirc; facie, the accuracy of his enquiries, and the fulne&s;s of his informa|tion. This remark belongs to St. Luke's hi&s;tory. Of the particularity which we alledge many examples may be found in all the Go&s;pels. And it is very difficult to con|ceive, that &s;uch numerous particularities, as are almo&s;t every where to be met with in the &s;criptures, &s;hould be rai&s;ed out of no|thing, or be &s;pun out of the imagination without any fact to go upon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"There is always &s;ome truth where there are con&s;iderable particularities related; and they always &s;eem to bear &s;ome proportion to one another. Thus there is a great want of the particulars, of time, place, and per&s;ons, in Manetho's account of the Egyptian Dyna&s;ties, Ete&s;ias's of the A&s;&s;yrian Kings, and tho&s;e which the technical chronologers have given of the ancient kingdoms of Greece; and agreeably thereto, the&s;e accounts have much fiction and fal&s;ehood, with &s;ome truth: whereas Thucydides's Hi&s;tory of the Peloponne&s;ian War, and Ce&s;ar's of the War in Gaul, in both which the particulars of time, place, and per|&s;ons are mentioned, are univer&s;ally e&s;teemed true to a great degree of exactne&s;s." Hartley, vol. ii. p. 109.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="360">
It is to be remarked, however, that this particularity is only to be looked for in direct hi&s;tory. It is not natural in references or allu&s;ions, which yet, in other re&s;pects, often afford, as far as they go, the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pi|cious evidence.</P>
<P N="6">VI. We lay out of the ca&s;e &s;uch &s;tories of &s;upernatural events, as require, on the part of the hearer, nothing more than an <HI>otio&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;ent; &s;tories upon which nothing depends, in which no intere&s;t is involved, nothing is to be done or changed in con&s;e|quence of believing them. Such &s;tories are

To this ca&s;e, and to this ca&s;e alone, belongs what is called the love of the marvellous. I have never known it carry men further. Men do not &s;uffer per&s;ecution from the love of the marvellous. Of the indifferent nature we are &s;peaking of, are mo&s;t vulgar errors and popular &s;uper&s;titions; mo&s;t, for in&s;tance, of the current reports of apparitions. Nothing depends upon their being true or fal&s;e. But not, &s;urely, of this kind were the alledged miracles of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. They decided, if true, the mo&s;t important que&s;tion, upon which the human mind can &s;ix its anxiety. They claimed to regulate the opinions of man|kind, upon &s;ubjects in which they are not only deeply concerned, but u&s;ually refractory and ob&s;tinate.

to his own nation and law wounded; if a Gentile, he found his idolatry and po|lythei&s;m reprobated and condemned. Who|ever entertained the account, whether Jew or Gentile, could not avoid the following reflection:&mdash;"If the&s;e things be true, I mu&s;t give up the opinions and principles in which I have been brought up, the religion in which my fathers lived and died." It is not con|ceivable that a man &s;hould do this upon any idle report or frivolous account, or, in|deed, without being fully &s;atisfied and con|vinced of the truth and credibility of the narrative to which he tru&s;ted. But it did not &s;top at opinions. They who believed Chri&s;tianity, acted upon it. Many made it the expre&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives to publi&s;h the intelligence. It was required of tho&s;e, who admitted that intelligence, to change forthwith their conduct and their principles, to take up a different cour&s;e of life, to part with their habits and gratifications, and begin a new &s;et of rules and &s;y&s;tem of be|haviour. The apo&s;tles, at lea&s;t, were inter|e&s;ted not to &s;acrifice their ea&s;e, their fortunes,

and their lives, for an idle tale; multitudes be&s;ide them were induced, by the &s;ame tale, to encounter oppo&s;ition, danger, and &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that the mere promi&s;e of a future &s;tate would do all this; I an&s;wer, that the mere promi&s;e of a future &s;tate, without any evidence to give credit or a&s;&s;urance to it, would do nothing. A few wandering fi&s;hermen talking of a re&s;urrection of the dead could produce no effect. If it be fur|ther &s;aid, that men ea&s;ily believe what they anxiou&s;ly de&s;ire, I again an&s;wer that, in my opinion, the very contrary of this is nearer to the truth. Anxiety of de&s;ire, earne&s;tne&s;s of expectation, the va&s;tne&s;s of an event, rather cau&s;es men to di&s;believe, to doubt, to dread a fallacy, to di&s;tru&s;t, and to examine. When our Lord's re&s;urrection was fir&s;t reported to the apo&s;tles, they did not believe, we are told, for joy. This was natural, and is agreeable to experience.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We have laid out of the ca&s;e tho&s;e
<PB N="346" REF="364">
accounts, which require no more than a &s;imple a&s;&s;ent; and we now al&s;o lay out of the ca&s;e tho&s;e which come merely <HI>in affirm|ance</HI> of opinions already formed. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is of the utmo&s;t importance to notice well. It has long been ob&s;erved, that Popi&s;h miracles happen in Popi&s;h coun|tries; that they make no converts: which proves that &s;tories are accepted, when they fall in with principles already fixed, with the public &s;entiments, or with the &s;entiments of a party already engaged on the &s;ide the miracle &s;upports, which would not be at|tempted to be produced in the face of ene|mies, in oppo&s;ition to reigning tenets or favourite prejudices, or when, if they be believed, the belief mu&s;t draw men away from their preconceived and habitual opinions, from their modes of life and rules of action. In the former ca&s;e, men may not only re|ceive a miraculous account, but may both act and &s;uffer on the &s;ide, and in the cau&s;e, which the miracle &s;upports, yet not act or &s;uffer <HI>for</HI> the miracle, but in pur&s;uance of a prior per&s;ua&s;ion. The miracle, like any other
<PB N="347" REF="365">
argument which only confirms what was before believed, is admitted with little exa|mination. In the moral, as in the natural world, it is <HI>change</HI> which requires a cau&s;e. Men are ea&s;ily fortified in their old opinions, driven from them with great difficulty. Now, how does this apply to the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory? The miracles, there recorded, were wrought in the mid&s;t of enemies, under a government, a prie&s;thood, and a magi&s;tracy, decidedly and vehemently adver&s;e to them, and to the preten&s;ions which they &s;upported. They were Prote&s;tant miracles in a Popi&s;h country: they were Popi&s;h miracles in the mid&s;t of Prote&s;tants. They produced a change; they e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ociety upon the &s;pot, adhering to the belief of them; they made converts, and tho&s;e who were converted, gave up to the te&s;timony, their mo&s;t fixed opinions, and mo&s;t favourite prejudices. They who acted and &s;uffered in the cau&s;e, acted and &s;uffered <HI>for</HI> the miracles; for there was no anterior per&s;ua&s;ion to induce them, no prior reverence, prejudice, or partiality, to take hold of. Je&s;us had not one follower when
<PB N="348" REF="366">
he &s;et up his claim. His miracles gave birth to his &s;ect. No part of this de&s;cription belongs to the ordinary evidence of Heathen or Popi&s;h miracles. Even mo&s;t of the mira|cles alledged to have been performed by Chri&s;tians, in the &s;econd and third century of its aera, want this confirmation. It con|&s;titutes indeed a line of partition between the <HI>origin</HI> and the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;tianity. Frauds and fallacies might mix them&s;elves with the progre&s;s, which could not po&s;&s;ibly take place in the commencement of the religion; at lea&s;t according to any laws of human conduct that we are acquainted with. What &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t to the fir&s;t propagators of Chri&s;tianity, e&s;pecially to fi&s;hermen, tax|gatherers, and hu&s;bandmen, &s;uch a thought as that of changing the religion of the world; what could bear them through the difficul|ties, in which the attempt engaged them; what could procure any degree of &s;uc|ce&s;s to the attempt; are que&s;tions which apply, with great force, to the &s;etting out of the in&s;titution, with le&s;s, to every future &s;tage of it.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="367">
To hear &s;ome men talk, one would &s;up|po&s;e the &s;etting up of a religion by miracles to be a thing of every day's experience; whereas the whole current of hi&s;tory is again&s;t it. Hath any founder of a new &s;ect among&s;t Chri&s;tians pretended to miraculous powers, and &s;ucceeded by his preten&s;ions? "Were the&s;e powers claimed or exerci&s;ed by the founders of the &s;ects of the Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es? Did Wickliff in England pretend to it? Did Hu&s;s or Jerome in Bohemia? Did Luther in Germany, Zuinglius in Swit|zerland, Calvin in France, or any of the reformers advance this plea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campbell on Miracles, p. 120, ed. 1766.</NOTE>?" The French prophets, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, ventured to alledge miraculous evi|dence, and immediately ruined their cau&s;e by their temerity. "Concerning the reli|gion of Ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, of China, a &s;ingle miracle cannot be named, that was ever offered as a te&s;t of any of tho&s;e religions <HI>before</HI> their e&s;tabli&s;hment <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Adams on Mir. p. 75.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="368">
We may add to what has been ob&s;erved, of the di&s;tinction which we are con&s;idering, that, where miracles are alledged merely in affirmance of a prior opinion, they who be|lieve the doctrine may &s;ometimes propagate a belief of the miracles which they do not them&s;elves entertain. This is the ca&s;e of what are called <HI>pious</HI> frauds; but it is a ca&s;e, I apprehend, which takes place, &s;olely in &s;upport of a per&s;ua&s;ion already e&s;tabli&s;hed. At lea&s;t it does not hold of the apo&s;tolical hi&s;tory. If the apo&s;tles did not believe the miracles, they did not believe the religion; and, without this belief, where was the <HI>piety,</HI> what place was there for any thing, which could bear the name or colour of piety, in publi&s;hing and atte&s;ting miracles in its be|half? If it be &s;aid that many promote the belief of revelation, and of any accounts which favour that belief, becau&s;e they think them, whether well or ill founded, of public and political utility, I an&s;wer, that if a cha|racter exi&s;t, which can with le&s;s ju&s;tice than another be a&s;cribed to the founders of the Chri&s;tian religion, it is that of politicians, or
<PB N="351" REF="369">
of men capable of entertaining political views. The truth is, that there is no a&s;&s;ign|able character, which will account for the conduct of the apo&s;tles, &s;uppo&s;ing their &s;tory to be fal&s;e. If bad men, what could have induced them to take &s;uch pains to promote virtue? If good men, they would not have gone about the country with a &s;tring of lies in their mouths?</P>
<P>IN APPRECIATING the credit of any miraculous &s;tory, the&s;e are di&s;tinctions which relate to the evidence. There are other di&s;tinctions, of great moment in the que&s;|tion, which relate to the miracles them&s;elves. Of which latter kind the following ought carefully to be retained.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to admit as a miracle, what can be re&s;olved into a <HI>fal&s;e perception.</HI> Of this nature was the demon of Socrates; the vi&s;ions of St. Anthony, and of many others; the vi&s;ion which Lord Herbert of Cherbury de&s;cribes him&s;elf to have &s;een; Colonel Gar|diner's vi&s;ion, as related in his life, written

All the&s;e may be ac|counted for by a momentary in&s;anity; for the characteri&s;tic &s;ymptom of human mad|ne&s;s is the ri&s;ing up in the mind of images not di&s;tingui&s;hable by the patient from im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the &s;en&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Batty on Lunacy.</NOTE>. The ca&s;es, how|ever, in which the po&s;&s;ibility of this delu&s;ion exi&s;ts, are divided from the ca&s;es in which it does not exi&s;t, by many, and tho&s;e not ob&s;cure marks. They are, for the mo&s;t part, ca&s;es of vi&s;ions or voices. The ob|ject is hardly ever touched. The vi&s;ion &s;ubmits not to be handled. One &s;en&s;e does not confirm another. They are likewi&s;e almo&s;t always ca&s;es of a <HI>&s;olitary</HI> witne&s;s. It is in the highe&s;t degree improbable, and I know not, indeed, whether it hath ever been the fact, that the &s;ame derangement of the mental organs &s;hould &s;eize different per&s;ons at the &s;ame time; a derangement, I mean, &s;o much the &s;ame, as to repre&s;ent to their imagination the &s;ame objects. La&s;tly, the&s;e are always ca&s;es of <HI>momentary</HI> miracles;
<PB N="353" REF="371">
by which term I mean to denote miracles, of which the whole exi&s;tence is of &s;hort duration, in contradi&s;tinction to miracles which are attended with permanent effects. The appearance of a &s;pectre, the hearing of a &s;upernatural &s;ound, is a momentary mira|cle. The &s;en&s;ible proof is gone, when the apparition or &s;ound is over. But if a per&s;on born blind be re&s;tored to &s;ight, a notorious cripple to the u&s;e of his limbs, or a dead man to life, here is a permanent effect pro|duced by &s;upernatural means. The change indeed was in&s;tantaneous, but the proof con|tinues. The &s;ubject of the miracle remains. The man cured or re&s;tored is there: his former condition was known, and his pre|&s;ent condition may be examined. This can by no po&s;&s;ibility be re&s;olved into fal&s;e per|ception: and of this kind are by far the greater part of the miracles recorded in the New Te&s;tament. When Lazarus was rai&s;ed from the dead, he did not merely move, and &s;peak, and die again; or come out of the grave, and vani&s;h away. He returned to his home and his family, and there continued;

for we find him, &s;ome time after|wards, in the &s;ame town, &s;itting at table with Je&s;us and his &s;i&s;ters; vi&s;ited by great mul|titudes of the Jews, as a &s;ubject of curio&s;ity; giving, by his pre&s;ence, &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s to the Jewi&s;h rulers, as to beget in them a de&s;ign of de&s;troying him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xii. 1, 2. 9, 10.</NOTE>. No delu&s;ion can account for this. The French prophets in England, &s;ome time &s;ince, gave out that one of their teachers would come to life again, but their enthu&s;ia&s;m never made them believe that they actually &s;aw him alive. The blind man, who&s;e re&s;toration to &s;ight at Jeru&s;alem is recorded in the ninth chapter of St. John's go&s;pel, did not quit the place, or conceal him&s;elf from enquiry. On the contrary, he was forthcoming, to an&s;wer the call, to &s;atisfy the &s;crutiny, and to &s;u&s;|tain the brow-beating of Chri&s;t's angry and powerful enemies. When the cripple at the gate of the temple was &s;uddenly cured by Peter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 2.</NOTE>, he did not immediately relap&s;e into his former lamene&s;s, or di&s;appear out of the

Here, though the miracle was &s;udden, the proof was permanent. The lamene&s;s had been notorious, the cure con|tinued. This, therefore, could not be the effect of any momentary delirium, either in the &s;ubject or in the witne&s;&s;es of the tran&s;action. It is the &s;ame with the greate&s;t number of the &s;cripture miracles. There are other ca&s;es of a <HI>mixed</HI> nature, in which, although the principal miracle be momen|tary, &s;ome circum&s;tance combined with it is permanent. Of this kind is the hi&s;tory of St. Paul's conver&s;ion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. ix.</NOTE>. The &s;udden light and &s;ound, the vi&s;ion and the voice, upon the road to Dama&s;cus, were momentary: but Paul's blindne&s;s for three days in con|&s;equence of what had happened; the com|munication made to Ananias in another place, and by a vi&s;ion independent of the former; Ananias finding out Paul in con&s;equence
<PB N="356" REF="374">
of intelligence &s;o received, and find|ing him in the condition de&s;cribed, and Paul's recovery of his &s;ight upon Ananias laying his hands upon him; are circum&s;tances, which take the tran&s;action, and the principal miracle as included in it, entirely out of the ca&s;e of momentary miracles, or of &s;uch as may be accounted for by fal&s;e perceptions. Exactly the &s;ame thing may be ob&s;erved of Peter's vi&s;ion preparatory to the call of Cor|nelius, and of its connection with what was imparted in a di&s;tant place to Cornelius him|&s;elf, and with the me&s;&s;age di&s;patched by Cornelius to Peter. The vi&s;ion might be a dream; the me&s;&s;age could not. Either communication, taken &s;eparately, might be a delu&s;ion; the concurrence of the two was impo&s;&s;ible to happen without a &s;upernatural cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the ri&s;k of delu&s;ion, which attaches upon momentary miracles, there is al&s;o much more room for <HI>impo&s;ture.</HI> The account can|not be examined at the moment. And, when that is al&s;o a moment of hurry and
<PB N="357" REF="375">
confu&s;ion, it may not be difficult for men of influence to gain credit to any &s;tory, which they may wi&s;h to have believed. This is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e of one of the be&s;t atte&s;ted of the miracles of old Rome, the appearance of Ca&s;tor and Pollux in the battle fought by Po&s;thumius with the Latins at the lake Re|gillus. There is no doubt but that Po&s;thu|mius, after the battle, &s;pread the report of &s;uch an appearance. No per&s;on could deny it, whil&s;t it was &s;aid to la&s;t. No per&s;on, perhaps, had any inclination to di&s;pute it afterwards; or, if they had, could &s;ay with po&s;itivene&s;s, what was, or what was not &s;een, by &s;ome or other of the army, in the di&s;may, and amid&s;t the tumult of a battle.</P>
<P>In a&s;&s;igning fal&s;e perceptions, as the origin to which &s;ome miraculous accounts may be referred, I have not mentioned claims to in|&s;piration, illuminations, &s;ecret notices or directions, internal &s;en&s;ations, or con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;&s;es of being acted upon by &s;piritual influ|ences, good or bad, becau&s;e, the&s;e appealing to no external proof, however convincing
<PB N="358" REF="376">
they may be to the per&s;ons them&s;elves, form no part of what can be accounted miraculous evidence. Their own credibility &s;tands upon their alliance with other miracles. The di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, therefore, of all &s;uch preten&s;ions may be omitted.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to bring into the compari&s;on what may be called <HI>tentative</HI> miracles; that is, where, out of a great num|ber of trials, &s;ome &s;ucceed; and in the ac|counts of which, although the narrative of the &s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es be alone pre&s;erved, and that of the un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es &s;unk, yet enough is &s;tated to &s;hew that the ca&s;es produced are only a few out of many in which the &s;ame means have been employed. This ob&s;erva|tion bears, with con&s;iderable force, upon the ancient oracles and auguries, in which a &s;in|gle coincidence of the event with the pre|diction is talked of and magnified, whil&s;t failures are forgotten, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or ac|counted for. It is al&s;o applicable to the cures wrought by relies, and at the tombs of faints. The boa&s;ted e&s;&s;icacy of the king's
<PB N="359" REF="377">
touch, upon which Mr. Hume lays &s;ome &s;tre&s;s, falls under the &s;ame de&s;cription. Nothing is alledged concerning it, which is not alledged of various no&s;trums, namely, out of many thou&s;ands who have u&s;ed them, certified proofs of a few who have recovered after them. No &s;olution of this &s;ort is ap|plicable to the miracles of the go&s;pel. There is nothing in the narrative which can induce, or even allow, us to believe, that Chri&s;t attempted cures in many in&s;tances, and &s;uc|ceeded in a few; or that he ever made the attempt in vain. He did not profe&s;s to heal every where all that were &s;ick; on the con|trary, he told the Jews, evidently meaning to repre&s;ent his own ca&s;e, that, "although many widows were in I&s;rael in the days of Elias, when the heaven was &s;hut up three years and &s;ix months, when great famine was throughout all the land, yet unto none of them was Elias &s;ent, &s;ave unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a wi|dow:" and that "many lepers were in I&s;rael in the time of Eli&s;eus the prophet, and none of them was clean&s;ed &s;aving Naaman

By which examples he gave them to under&s;tand, that it was not the na|ture of a divine interpo&s;ition, or nece&s;&s;ary to its purpo&s;e, to be general; &s;till le&s;s, to an|&s;wer every challenge that might be made, which would teach men to put their faith upon the&s;e experiments. Chri&s;t never pro|nounced the word, but the effect followed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One, and only one, in&s;tance may be produced in which the <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> of Chri&s;t do &s;eem to have attempted a cure, and not to have been able to perform it.

It was not a thou&s;and &s;ick that received his benediction, and a few that were benefited: a &s;ingle paralytic is let down in his bed at Je&s;us' feet, in the mid&s;t of a &s;urrounding multitude; Je&s;us bid him walk, and he did

There was nothing tentative in the&s;e cures; nothing that can be explained by the power of accident.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve al&s;o, that many of the cures which Chri&s;t wrought, &s;uch as that of a per&s;on blind from his birth, al&s;o many miracles be&s;ide cures, as rai&s;ing the dead, walking upon the &s;ea, feeding a great mul|titude with a few loaves and fi&s;hes, are of a nature which does not in any wife admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition of a fortunate experiment.</P>
<P N="3">III. We may di&s;mi&s;s from the que&s;tion all accounts in which, allowing the pheno|menon to be real, the fact to be true, it &s;till remains <HI>doubtful</HI> whether a miracle were wrought. This is the ca&s;e with the ancient hi&s;tory of what is called the thundering

legion, of the extraordinary circum&s;tances which ob&s;tructed the rebuilding of the tem|ple at Jeru&s;alem by Julian, the circling of the flames and fragrant &s;mell at the martyr|dom of Polycarp, the &s;udden &s;hower that extingui&s;hed the fire into which the &s;criptures were thrown in the Diocletian per&s;ecution; Con&s;tantine's dream, his in&s;cribing in con|&s;equence of it the cro&s;s upon his &s;tandard and the &s;hields of his &s;oldiers; his victory, and the e&s;cape of the &s;tandard bearer; per|haps al&s;o the imagined appearance of the cro&s;s in the heavens, though this la&s;t cir|cum&s;tance is very deficient in hi&s;torical evi|dence. It is al&s;o the ca&s;e with the modern annual exhibition of the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius at Naples. It is a doubt likewi&s;e, which ought to be excluded by very &s;pecial circum&s;tances, from the&s;e narratives which relate to the &s;upernatural cure of hypochondriacal and nervous com|plaints, and of all di&s;ea&s;es which are much affected by the imagination. The miracles of the &s;econd and third century are, u&s;ually, healing the &s;ick, and ca&s;ting out evil &s;pirits,
<PB N="363" REF="381">
miracles in which there is room for &s;ome error and deception. We hear nothing of cau&s;ing the blind to &s;ee, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the lepers to be clean&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jortin's Remarks, vol. ii. p. 51.</NOTE>. There are al&s;o in&s;tances in Chri&s;tian-writers, of reputed miracles, which were natural operations, though not known to be &s;uch at the time, as that of articulate &s;peech after the lo&s;s of a great part of the tongue.</P>
<P N="4">IV. To the &s;ame head of objection nearly, may al&s;o be referred accounts, in which the variation of a &s;mall circum&s;tance may have transformed &s;ome extraordinary appearance, or &s;ome critical coincidence of events, into a miracle; &s;tories, in a word, which may be re&s;olved into exaggeration. The miracles of the go&s;pel can by no po&s;&s;ibility be ex|plained away in this manner. Total fiction will account for any thing; but no &s;tretch of exaggeration that has any parallel in other hi&s;tories, no force of fancy upon real cir|cum&s;tances, could produce the narratives which we now have. The feeding of the
<PB N="364" REF="382">
five thou&s;and with a few loaves and fi&s;hes &s;urpa&s;&s;es all bounds of exaggeration. The rai&s;ing of Lazarus, of the widow's &s;on at Nain, as well as many of the cures which Chri&s;t wrought, come not within the com|pa&s;s of mi&s;repre&s;entation. I mean, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign any po&s;ition of circum|&s;tances however peculiar, any accidental ef|fects however extraordinary, any natural &s;ingularity, which could &s;upply an origin or foundation to the&s;e accounts.</P>
<P>Having thus enumerated &s;everal excep|tions, which may ju&s;tly be taken to relations of miracles, it is nece&s;&s;ary, when we read the &s;criptures, to bear in our minds this ge|neral remark, that, although there be mira|cles recorded in the New Te&s;tament, which fall within &s;ome or other of the exceptions here a&s;&s;igned, yet that they are united with others, to which none of the &s;ame exceptions extend, and that their credibility &s;tands upon this union. Thus the vi&s;ions and re|velations, which St. Paul a&s;&s;erts to have been imparted to him, may not, in their &s;eparate evidence, be di&s;tingui&s;hable from the vi&s;ions
<PB N="365" REF="383">
and revelations which many others have alledged. But here is the difference. St. Paul's preten&s;ions were atte&s;ted by external miracles wrought by him&s;elf, and by mira|cles wrought in the cau&s;e to which the&s;e vi|&s;ions relate; or, to &s;peak more properly, the &s;ame hi&s;torical authority, which informs us of one, informs us of the other. This is not ordinarily true of the vi&s;ions of en|thu&s;ia&s;ts, or even of the accounts in which they are contained. Again, &s;ome of Chri&s;t's own miracles were <HI>momentary;</HI> as the transfiguration, the appearance and voice from Heaven at his bapti&s;m, a voice from the clouds upon one occa&s;ion afterwards, (John xii. 30.) and &s;ome others. It is not denied, that the di&s;tinction which we have propo&s;ed concerning miracles of this &s;pecies, applies, in diminution of the force of the evi|dence, as much to the&s;e in&s;tances as to others. But this is the ca&s;e, not with all the miracles a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t, nor with the greate&s;t part, nor with many. Whatever force therefore there may be in the objection, we have numerous miracles which are free
<PB N="366" REF="384">
from it; and even the&s;e to which it is appli|cable, are little affected by it in their credit, becau&s;e there are few, who, admitting the re&s;t, will reject <HI>them.</HI> If there be miracles of the New Te&s;tament, which come within any of the <HI>other</HI> heads into which we have di&s;tributed the objections, the &s;ame remark mu&s;t be repeated. And this is one way, in which the unexampled number and variety of the miracles a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t, &s;trengthens the credibility of Chri&s;tianity. For it pre|cludes any &s;olution, or conjecture about a &s;olution, which imagination, or even which experience might &s;ugge&s;t concerning &s;ome particular miracles, if con&s;idered independ|ently of others. The miracles of Chri&s;t were of various kinds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not only healing every &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, but turn|ing water into wine (John ii.); feeding multitudes with a few loaves and fi&s;hes (Mat. xiv. 14.

<P>I apprehend that, when we remove from the compari&s;on, the ca&s;es which are fairly di&s;po&s;ed of by the ob&s;ervations that have been &s;tated, many ca&s;es will not remain.

<P>BUT they, with whom we argue, have undoubtedly a right to elect their own ex|amples. The in&s;tances with which Mr. Hume hath cho&s;en to confront the miracles of the New Te&s;tament, and which, therefore, we are intitled to regard, as the &s;tronge&s;t which the hi&s;tory of the world could &s;upply to the enquiries of a very acute and learned adver&s;ary, are the three following:</P>
<P N="1">1. The cure of a blind and of a lame man at Alexandria, by the Emperor Ve&s;pa&s;ian, as related by Tacitus;</P>
<P N="2">2. The re&s;toration of the limb of an attend|ant in a Spani&s;h church, as told by Cardinal de Retz; and</P>
<P N="3">3. The cures &s;aid to be performed at the
<PB N="370" REF="388">
tomb of the Abb&eacute; Paris, in the early part of the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P N="1">1. The narrative of Tacitus is delivered in the&s;e terms: "One of the common peo|ple of Alexandria, known to be di&s;ea&s;ed in his eyes, by the admonition of the god Serapis, whom that &s;uper&s;titious nation wor|&s;hip above all other gods, pro&s;trated him&s;elf before the emperor, earne&s;tly imploring from him a remedy for his blindne&s;s, and entreating, that he would deign to anoint with his &s;pittle his cheeks and the balls of his eyes. Another, di&s;ea&s;ed in his hand, re|que&s;ted, by the admonition of the &s;ame god, that he might be touched by the foot of the emperor. Ve&s;pa&s;ian at fir&s;t derided and de|&s;pi&s;ed their application; afterwards, when they continued to urge their petitions, he, &s;ometimes, appeared to dread the imputation of vanity; at other times, by the earne&s;t &s;upplication of the patients, and the per&s;ua|&s;ion of his flatterers, to be induced to hope for &s;ucce&s;s. At length he commanded an enquiry to be made by phy&s;icians, whether
<PB N="371" REF="389">
&s;uch a blindne&s;s and debility were vincible by human aid. The report of the phy&s;i|cians contained various points; that in the one, the power of vi&s;ion was not de&s;troyed, but would return, if the ob&s;tacles were re|moved; that, in the other, the di&s;ea&s;ed joints might be re&s;tored, if a healing power were applied; that it was, perhaps, agreeable to the gods to do this; that the emperor was elected by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; la&s;tly, that the credit of the &s;ucce&s;s would be the emperor's, the ridicule of the di&s;appointment would fall upon the patients. Ve&s;pa&s;ian, believing that every thing was in the power of his fortune, and that nothing was any longer incredible, whil&s;t the multitude, which &s;tood by, eagerly expected the event, with a coun|tenance expre&s;&s;ive of joy executed what he was de&s;ired to do. Immediately the hand was re&s;tored to its u&s;e, and light returned to the blind man. They, who were pre&s;ent, relate both the&s;e cures, even at this time, when there is nothing to be gained by lying <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tac. Hi&s;t. lib. iv.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="390">
Now, though Tacitus wrote this account twenty-&s;even years after the miracle is &s;aid to have been performed, and wrote at Rome of what pa&s;&s;ed at Alexandria, and wrote al&s;o from report; and although it does not ap|pear that he had examined the &s;tory, or that he believed it (but rather the contrary), yet I think his te&s;timony &s;ufficient to prove, that &s;uch a tran&s;action took place: by which I mean, that the two men in que&s;tion did apply to Ve&s;pa&s;ian, that Ve&s;pa&s;ian did touch the di&s;ea&s;ed in the manner related, and that a cure was reported to have followed the operation. But the affair labours under a &s;trong and ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that the whole of it was a concerted impo&s;ture brought about by collu&s;ion, between the patients, the phy&s;i|cian, and the emperor. This &s;olution is probable, becau&s;e there was every thing to &s;ugge&s;t, and every thing to facilitate &s;uch a &s;cheme. The miracle was calcu|lated to confer honour upon the empe|ror, and upon the god Serapis. It was achieved in the mid&s;t of the emperor's flat|terers and followers; in a city, and among&s;t
<PB N="373" REF="391">
a populace, beforehand devoted to his in|tere&s;t, and to the wor&s;hip of the god; where it would have been trea&s;on and bla&s;phemy together, to have contradicted the fame of the cure, or even to have que&s;tioned it. And what is very ob&s;ervable in the account is, that the report of the phy&s;icians is ju&s;t &s;uch a report as would have been made of a ca&s;e, in which no external marks of the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ted, and which, con&s;equently, was capable of being ea&s;ily counterfeited, viz. that, in the fir&s;t of the patients, the organs of vi&s;ion were not de&s;troyed, that the weak|ne&s;s of the &s;econd was in his joints. The &s;tronge&s;t circum&s;tance in Tacitus's narration is, that the fir&s;t patient was <HI>"notus</HI> tabe ocu|lorum," remarked or notorious for the di&s;|ea&s;e in his eyes. But this was a circum|&s;tance which might have found its way into the &s;tory in its progre&s;s from a di&s;tant coun|try, and during an interval of thirty years; or it might be true that the malady of the eyes was notorious, yet that the nature and degree of the di&s;ea&s;e had never been a&s;cer|tained: a ca&s;e by no means uncommon.
<PB N="374" REF="392">
The emperor's re&s;erve was ea&s;ily affected; or it is po&s;&s;ible he might not be in the &s;ecret. There does not &s;eem to be much weight in the ob&s;ervation of Tacitus, that they who were pre&s;ent continued even then to relate the &s;tory, when there was nothing to be gained by the lie. It only proves that tho&s;e who had told the &s;tory for many years, per|&s;i&s;ted in it. The &s;tate of mind of the wit|ne&s;&s;es and &s;pectators <HI>at the time,</HI> is the point to be attended to. Still le&s;s is there of per|tinency in Mr. Hume's eulogium upon the cautious and penetrating genius of the hi&s;|torian; for it does not appear that the hi&s;|torian believed it. The terms in which he &s;peaks of Serapis, the deity to who&s;e inter|po&s;ition the miracle was attributed, &s;carcely &s;uffer us to &s;uppo&s;e that Tacitus thought the miracle to be real, "by the admonition of the god Serapis, whom that &s;uper&s;titious na|tion (dedita &s;uper&s;titionibus gens) wor&s;hip above all other gods." To have brought this &s;uppo&s;ed miracle within the limits of compari&s;on with the miracles of Chri&s;t, it ought to have appeared, that a per&s;on of a
<PB N="375" REF="393">
low and private &s;tation, in the mid&s;t of ene|mies, with the whole power of the country oppo&s;ing him, with every one around him prejudiced or intere&s;ted again&s;t his claims and character, pretended to perform the&s;e cures; and required the &s;pectators, upon the &s;trength of what they &s;aw, to give up their firme&s;t hopes and opinions, and follow <HI>him</HI> through a life of trial and danger; that many were &s;o moved, as to obey his call, at the expence, both of every notion in which they had been brought up, and of their ea&s;e, &s;afety and reputation; and that by the&s;e be|ginnings a change was produced in the world, the effects of which remain to this day: a ca&s;e, both in its circum&s;tances and con&s;equences, very unlike any thing we &s;ind in Tacitus's relation.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;tory taken from the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz, which is the &s;econd ex|ample alledged by Mr. Hume, is this: "In the church of Sarago&s;&s;a in Spain, the canons &s;hewed me a man who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to
<PB N="376" REF="394">
light the lamps, telling me that he had been &s;everal years at the gate, with one leg only. I &s;aw him with two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Liv. iv. A. D. 1654.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It is &s;tated by Mr. Hume, that the Car|dinal who relates this &s;tory, did not believe it; and it no where appears, that he either examined the limb, or a&s;ked the patient, or indeed any one, a &s;ingle que&s;tion about the matter. An artificial leg wrought with art, would be &s;ufficient, in a place where no &s;uch contrivance had ever before been heard of, to give origin and currency to the report. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics of the place would, it is probable, favour the &s;tory, ina&s;much as it advanced the honour of their image and church. And if <HI>they</HI> patronized it, no other per&s;on at Sarago&s;&s;a, in the middle of the la&s;t century, would care to di&s;pute it. The &s;tory likewi&s;e coincided, not le&s;s with the wi&s;hes and preconceptions of the people, than with the intere&s;ts of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers; &s;o that there was prejudice backed
<PB N="377" REF="395">
by authority, and both operating upon ex|treme ignorance, to account for the &s;ucce&s;s of the impo&s;ture. If, as I have &s;ugge&s;ted, the contrivance of an artificial limb was then new, it would not occur to the Cardinal him&s;elf to &s;u&s;pect it; e&s;pecially under the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of mind with which he heard the tale, and the little inclination he felt to &s;cru|tinize or expo&s;e its fallacy.</P>
<P N="3">3. The miracles related to have been wrought at the tomb of the Abb&eacute; Paris, ad|mit in general of this &s;olution. The patients who frequented the tomb, were &s;o affected by their devotion, their expectation, the place, the &s;olemnity, and, above all, by the &s;ympathy of the &s;urrounding multitude, that many of them were thrown into violent con|vul&s;ions, which convul&s;ions, in certain in|&s;tances, produced a removal of di&s;orders de|pending upon ob&s;truction. We &s;hall, at this day, have the le&s;s difficulty in admitting the above account, becau&s;e it is the very &s;ame thing, as hath lately been experienced in the operations of animal magneti&s;m; and
<PB N="378" REF="396">
the report of the French phy&s;icians upon that my&s;terious remedy is very applicable to the pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, viz. that the pretenders to the art, by working upon the imaginations of their patients, were fre|quently able to produce convul&s;ions; that convul&s;ions &s;o produced are among&s;t the mo&s;t powerful, but, at the &s;ame time, mo&s;t uncertain and unmanageable applications to the human frame, which can be employed.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances, which indicate this expli|cation in the ca&s;e of the Pari&s;ian miracles, are the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. They were <HI>tentative.</HI> Out of many thou&s;and &s;ick, infirm, and di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, who re&s;orted to the tomb, the profe&s;&s;ed hi&s;tory of the miracles contains only nine cures.</P>
<P N="2">2. The convul&s;ions at the tomb are ad|mitted.</P>
<P N="3">3. The di&s;ea&s;es were, for the mo&s;t part,
<PB N="379" REF="397">
of that &s;ort, which depends upon inaction and ob&s;truction, as drop&s;ies, pal&s;ies, and &s;ome tumours.</P>
<P N="4">4. The cures were gradual; &s;ome patients attending many days, &s;ome &s;everal weeks, and &s;ome &s;everal months.</P>
<P N="5">5. The cures were many of them incom|plete.</P>
<P N="6">6. Others were temporary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will find the&s;e particulars verified in the detail, by the accurate enquiries of the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop of Sarum in his Criterion of Miracles, p. 132 et &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So that all the wonder we are called upon to account for is, that, out of an almo&s;t in|numerable multitude which re&s;orted to the tomb for the cure of their complaints, and many of whom were there agitated by &s;trong convul&s;ions, a very &s;mall proportion expe|rienced a beneficial change in their con&s;ti|tution, e&s;pccially in the action of the nerves and glands.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="398">
Some of the ca&s;es alledged do not require that we &s;hould have recour&s;e to this &s;olution. The fir&s;t ca&s;e in the catalogue is &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from the progre&s;s of a natural recovery. It was that of a young man, who laboured under an inflammation of one eye, and had lo&s;t the &s;ight of the other. The inflamed eye was relieved, but the blindne&s;s of the other remained. The inflammation had before been abated by medicine; and the young man, at the time of his attend|ance at the tomb, was u&s;ing a lotion of lau|danum. And, what is a &s;till more material part of the ca&s;e, the inflammation after &s;ome interval returned. Another ca&s;e was that of a young man who had lo&s;t his &s;ight by the puncture of an awl, and the di&s;charge of the aqueous humour through the wound. The &s;ight, which had been gradually return|ing, was much improved during his vi&s;it to the tomb, that is, probably in the &s;ame de|gree in which the di&s;charged humour was replaced by fre&s;h &s;ecretions. And it is ob|&s;ervable, that the&s;e two are the only ca&s;es, which, from their nature, &s;hould &s;eem un|likely to be affected by convul&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="399">
In one material re&s;pect I allow, that the Pari&s;ian miracles were different from tho&s;e related by Tacitus, and from the Spani&s;h miracle of the Cardinal de Retz. They had not, like them, all the power and all the prejudice of the country on their &s;ide to begin with. They were alledged by one party again&s;t another, by the Jan&s;eni&s;ts again&s;t the Je&s;uits. The&s;e were of cour&s;e oppo&s;ed and examined by their adver&s;aries. The con&s;equence of which examination was, that many fal&s;ehoods were detected, that with &s;omething really extraordinary much fraud appeared to be mixed. And if &s;ome of the ca&s;es, upon which de&s;igned mi&s;|repre&s;entation could not be charged, were not at the time &s;atisfactorily accounted for, it was becau&s;e the e&s;&s;icacy of &s;trong &s;pa&s;|modic affections was not then &s;ufficiently known. Finally, the cau&s;e of Jan&s;eni&s;m did not ri&s;e by the miracles, but &s;unk, although the miracles had the anterior per|&s;ua&s;ion of all the numerous adherents of that cau&s;e to &s;et out with.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="400">
The&s;e, let us remember, are the &s;tronge&s;t examples, which the hi&s;tory of ages &s;upplies. In none of them was the miracle <HI>unequi|vocal;</HI> by none of them were e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices and per&s;ua&s;ions overthrown; of none of them did the credit make its way, in oppo&s;ition to authority and power; by none of them were many induced to com|mit them&s;elves. and that in contradiction to prior opinions, to a life of mortification, danger, and &s;ufferings: none were called upon to atte&s;t them, at the expence of their fortunes and &s;afety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be thought that the hi&s;torian of the Pari&s;ian miracles, M. Montgeron, forms an exception to this la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion. He pre&s;ented his book (with a &s;u&s;picion, as it &s;hould &s;eem, of the danger of what he was doing) to the king; and was &s;hortly afterwards committed to pri&s;on, from which he never came out. Had the mira|cles been unequivocal, and had M. Montgeron been originally convinced by them, I &s;hould have allowed this exception. It would have &s;tood, I think, alone, in the argument of our adver&s;aries. But, be&s;ide what has been ob&s;erved of the dubious nature of the miracles, the account, which M. Montgeron has him&s;elf left of his conver&s;ion, &s;hews both the &s;tate of his mind, and <HI>that his per&s;ua&s;ien was not built upon external miracles.</HI> "Scarcely had he entered the church-yard, when he was &s;truck," he tells us, "with awe and reverence, having never be&s;ore heard prayers pronounced with &s;o much ardour and tran&s;port, as he ob&s;erved among&s;t the &s;upplicants at the tomb. Upon this, throwing him&s;elf on his knees, re&s;ting his elbows on the tomb|&s;tone, and covering his face with his hands, he &s;pake the following prayer: <HI>O thou, by who&s;e interce&s;&s;ion &s;o many miracles are &s;aid to be performed, if it be true that a part of thee &s;urviveth the grave, and that thou ha&s;t influence with the Almighty, have pity on the darkne&s;s of my under&s;tanding, and through his mercy obtain the removal of it.</HI> Having prayed thus, many thoughts, as he &s;ayeth, began to open them&s;elves to his mind; and &s;o profound was his attention, that he continued on his knees four hours, not in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed by the va&s;t crowd of &s;urround|ing &s;upplicants. During this time all the arguments which he ever heard or read in favour of Chri&s;tianity, occurred to him with &s;o much force, and &s;eemed &s;o &s;trong and convincing, that he went home fully &s;ati&s;|fied of the truth of religion in general, and of the holi|ne&s;s and power of that per&s;on, who," as he &s;uppo&s;ed, "had engaged the divine goodne&s;s to enlighten his under&s;tanding &s;o &s;uddenly."
