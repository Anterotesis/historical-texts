<HEAD>AN APPENDIX In An&s;wer to the <HI>Rea&s;ons for not re|plying to Mr.</HI> WALTON'S Full An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>_BY a Paper, intitled, <HI>Rea&s;ons for not replying to Mr.</HI> WALTON<HI>'s full An&s;wer,</HI> I find that the Author of the <HI>Minute Philo&s;opher,</HI> &s;till per&s;i&s;ts in his Mi&s;takes concerning Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Doctrine of Fluxions. He declares <HI>he can hone&s;tly &s;ay, that the more I explain, the more he is puzzled:</HI> And I can as ho|ne&s;tly &s;ay, that I believe him. For a Per|&s;on who does not under&s;tand what Sir
<PB N="34" REF="2">
<HI>I&s;aac</HI> means by <HI>Velocity,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be ignorant of his Doctrine of Fluxions, deduc'd from the Nature of <HI>Velocity</HI>; and be puzzled with all true Explications of that Doctrine. What Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> means by the Word <HI>Velocity,</HI> I &s;hall ex|plain in the following Propo&s;itions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. The Velocity of a Body, is the Ratio of the Quantity of Motion to the Quantity of Matter in the Body; and is as the Ratio of the Quantity of the Action of the moving Force to the Weight of the Body; or as the Ratio of the Quantity of that Action to the Den&s;ity and Magnitude of the Body taken together. That is, putting V for the Velocity of a Body, M for the Quantity of its Motion, F for the Quantity of the Action of the Force which generates that Motion, D for the Den&s;ity of the Body, B for its Bulk or Magnitude
<PB N="35" REF="3">
and W for its Weight; V is M / Q, and is as F / W, or as F / DB.</P>
<P>For the Quantity of Motion is the Quantity of Matter and Velocity taken together; that is, M is QV: And con|&s;equently V is M / Q: But the Motion of a Body is as the Quantity of the Action of the Force which generates it, Effects be|ing always proportional to their adequate Cau&s;es, that is, M is as F; and at a given Di&s;tance from the Centre of the Earth, the Quantity of Matter in a Body, is as its Weight, or as its Denfity and Magni|tude taken together; that is, Q is as W, or as DB: And therefore V is as F / W, or as F / DB.</P>
<P>The Forces which generate Motion in Bodies may be of different Kinds, as a Blow, Pre&s;&s;ure, Weight; all which may
<PB N="36" REF="4">
be conceived: And Den&s;ity and Bulk may likewi&s;e be conceiv'd: Con&s;equent|ly the two Mea&s;ures of Velocity, F / W and F / DB, may both be conceived, and yet nei|ther of them includes Time and Space. This Author therefore has been gro&s;ly mi&s;taken in a&s;&s;erting that <HI>Velocity</HI> nece&s;|&s;arily <HI>implies both Time and Space, and</HI> cannot <HI>be conceiv'd without them.&mdash;And that there is NO Mea&s;ure of Velocity except Time and Space, the Proportion of Velocities being ONLY compound|ed of the direct Proportion of the Spa|ces and the reciprocal Proportion of the Times.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. The Velocity of a Body, exi&s;ts in the Body it &s;elf while it conti|nues in Motion.</P>
<P>For the Velocity of a Body, is an Ef|fect of &s;ome Cau&s;e acting upon it: But this Effect can exi&s;t no where except in the Body acted upon; for could it exi&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="5">
any where el&s;e, an Effect might exi&s;t where there is no Cau&s;e to produce it, or in other Words, an Effect might exi&s;t without a Cau&s;e, which is ab&s;urd: And therefore the Velocity of a Body exi&s;ts in the Body it &s;elf while it continues in Motion.</P>
<P>Hence it appears that a Body in Mo|tion, will have a Velocity inherent in it &s;elf during the whole Time of its Mo|tion: And con&s;equently there mu&s;t be a Velocity where-ever the Body is, exclu|&s;ive of Time and Space. If in&s;tead of a Body the Thing moved be a Point, its Velocity will exi&s;t in a Point, and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively will exi&s;t in every Point of Space through which the Point moves.</P>
<P>Here I may properly take notice of this Author's Objection again&s;t my Proof that Velocity can exi&s;t in a Point; my Argument for it was conceived in the&s;e Words. <Q REND="inline">If a Cau&s;e acts continually up|on a given Body or Thing, in order to move it without any Interruption, there mu&s;t en&s;ue a continual Increa&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="6">
of its Velocity; and con&s;equently no two Points of the Space de&s;cribed, however near to each other, can be a&s;&s;ign'd, in which the Velocity is the &s;ame: For that wou'd manife&s;tly &s;up|po&s;e a Ce&s;&s;ation of the Action of the moving Cau&s;e during the Pa&s;&s;age of the Body or Thing thro' the Interval com|prehended between the two Points.</Q> Now he thinks that from the continual Action of a moving Force, and from the generated Velocity not being the &s;ame in any two different Points of the de|&s;cribed Space, it will not follow that Ve|locity can exi&s;t in a Point of Space. But in this he is mi&s;taken. For the conti|nual Action of the moving Force nece&s;|&s;arily pre&s;erves a <HI>continual</HI> Velocity; and if the generated Velocity be not the &s;ame in any two different Points of the de|&s;cribed Space, a Velocity mu&s;t of Con&s;e|quence exi&s;t in every Point of that Space.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>III. The Velocity of a Body is the Rate or Degree of its Tendency forward.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="7">
For the Velocity of a Body, is a Part of its Motion by the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, and exi&s;ts in the Body, by the &s;econd: But there is nothing exi&s;ting in a Body moved or tran&s;lated from one Place to another be&s;ides its Quantity of Matter, and the Rate or Degree of its Tendency forward: And therefore the Velocity of a Body is the Rate or Degree of its Ten|dency forward.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>IV. The Account of Velocity given in the two preceding Propo|&s;itions, is agreeable to Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>'s Notion of Velocity; who con|&s;tantly excludes de&s;cribed Space from his Idea of that Term.</P>
<P>For, as I remember, whenever he u&s;es the Word <HI>Velocity</HI> in his Principles of Philo&s;ophy, he &s;peaks of the Velocity of a Body exi&s;ting in &s;ome one certain Place; by which it appears, that he confines Ve|locity to the Place of the Body: But there is no Space de&s;cribed by a moving
<PB N="40" REF="8">
Body exi&s;ting in one and the &s;ame Place: And therefore he excludes all Space de|&s;cribed from his <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Velocity.</HI> And he expre&s;ly does it in his Doctrine of Fluxions. For he calls Velocities <HI>Flux|ions</HI>; and by Fluxions declares, that he does not under&s;tand any Increments ge|nerated, and con&s;equently not any Spaces de&s;cribed: Whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that Velocities, in his Doctrine of Flux|ions, do not imply any Spaces de&s;cribed. Therefore the Propo&s;ition is true.</P>
<P>The Velocity of a Body, is an Effect communicated to the Body by the Ac|tion of &s;ome moving Force or Cau&s;e, and is retain'd in it by the Inertne&s;s of Mat|ter, till de&s;troy'd by the Action of &s;ome contrary Force or Re&s;i&s;tance; and by be|ing retain'd in it, becomes a Cau&s;e of the Body's going forward, or of its being tran&s;lated continually into a new Place: So that the continual Tran&s;lation of a Body into a new Place, is really an <HI>Effect</HI> of Velocity, which Velocity may be conceived to exi&s;t in the Body prior to
<PB N="41" REF="9">
the Progre&s;s of that Body, as all Cau&s;es may be conceiv'd to exi&s;t prior to the Effects produc'd by them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>V. If the Velocity of a Body or Thing moved be given, or increa&s;e with the Time of the Motion, it will be mea&s;ur'd by the Space de&s;cribed apply'd to the Time of its De&s;crip|tion: And if it increa&s;es any how either regularly or irregularly, it will be mea&s;ur'd by the fir&s;t Ratio of the Space to be de&s;cribed in a given Particle of Time. If S de|notes the Space de&s;cribed in the Time T, and S the fir&s;t Ratio of the Space to be de&s;cribed in a given Particle of Time, then V will be as S / T when the Velocity is either given, or increa&s;es with the Time of the Motion; and as S when it increa&s;es any how regularly or irregularly.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="10">
<HI>Ca&s;e</HI> 1. If the Velocity be given, that is, if the Body con&s;tantly goes on at the &s;ame Rate, the Space de&s;cribed, reckon|ing from the Beginning of the Motion, will be as the Time of its De&s;cription; and con&s;equently the Ratio of the Space de&s;cribed to the Time of its De&s;cription; that is, S / T will be a given Quantity: But one given Quantity may be the Mea&s;ure of another: And therefore V will be mea&s;ur'd by S / T.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e</HI> 2. If the Velocity increa&s;es with the Time of the Motion, the Space de|&s;crib'd mu&s;t increa&s;e with the Square of the Time; whence S / T will be as T, that is, as V: And con&s;equently in this Ca&s;e al&s;o V will be mea&s;ur'd by S / T.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e</HI> 3. If the Velocity increa&s;es any how either regularly or irregularly, the Space to be de&s;cribed in a given Particle of Time, will begin to exi&s;t, no Part of
<PB N="43" REF="11">
it being yet de&s;cribed, with the Ratio of the Velocity: But the Ratio with which that Space begins to exi&s;t or to be de|&s;cribed, is its fir&s;t <HI>Ratio:</HI> And therefore the Velocity will be mea&s;ured by the fir&s;t Ratio of the Space to be de&s;cribed in a given Particle of Time. Con&s;equently V in all Ca&s;es will be mea&s;ur'd by S.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Ca&s;es of this Propo&s;i|tion are particular ones, and obtain <HI>only</HI> when the Force which generates the Mo|tion acts either by one &s;ingle Impul&s;e, or continually with the &s;ame Degree of Strength during the whole Time of Mo|tion: The la&s;t is a general one, and ob|tains in all Ca&s;es whatever: This general Mea&s;ure of Velocity Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> u&s;es in his Doctrine of Fluxions: It con|tinually exi&s;ts in the final Limits or Ex|tremities of Quantities actually generated by Motion, and ju&s;t beginning to be in|creas'd by a Continuance of that Mo|tion, tho' as yet no Parts of their i&s;o|chronal Increments are de&s;cribed; for tho&s;e Increments <HI>mu&s;t</HI> begin to exi&s;t in the Ra|tio of the Velocities, which the genera|ting
<PB N="44" REF="12">
Quantities have in the final Limits of the Quantities generated, which are the initial Limits of their Increments. If the Ratio of the Velocities exi&s;ting in any two Points be 4/3 or 3/2, the fir&s;t Ratio of i&s;o|chronal Increments commencing from tho&s;e Points, will be 4/3 or 3/2.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn what Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> means by the Word <HI>Velocity,</HI> and given an Account of its <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI>; I will now, by way of Inference, &s;hew the Weakne&s;s of this Author's Objections again&s;t the &s;e|veral Parts of the foregoing An&s;wer; and in doing of this I &s;hall be le&s;s methodical, becau&s;e I intend to pur&s;ue <HI>him</HI> in the order of his <HI>Rea&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, in <HI>Sect.</HI> 3. he takes notice of my Freedom in calling his <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> a Libel: I am &s;orry my <HI>free Manner</HI> &s;hould offend him; but I mu&s;t continue to call it a Libel, till he produces Proofs to the contrary. He tells me, <HI>I well know a bad Vindication is the bittere&s;t Libel.</HI> I cannot &s;ay I know it; but I know that defaming one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="13">
Men, who had nothing at heart be&s;ides the Promotion of true Philo&s;ophy and true Religion; is a mo&s;t <HI>bitter</HI> Libel: A bad Vindication may proceed from a good Mind and an hone&s;t Intention; but De|famation and Detraction can ari&s;e from neither.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sect.</HI> 4, 5. he finds fault with my Proof that Velocity can exi&s;t in a Point of Space. But I have &s;hewn the Ju&s;tne&s;s of that Proof under the &s;econd Propo&s;i|tion, to which I refer him. That Proof may perhaps appear more evident to &s;ome, by con&s;idering the Motion of a Body in falling from a State of Re&s;t by the Force of its own Weight. For &s;etting a&s;ide the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Air, and &s;uppo&s;ing the Weight of the Body to be the &s;ame at all near Di&s;tances from the Surface of the Earth; its Velocity, from the continued Action of that Weight, will increa&s;e con|tinually as the Time of falling increa&s;es, or as the &s;quare Root of the Length de|&s;cribed increa&s;es, reckoning that Length from the Beginning of the Motion; and therefore Velocity will exi&s;t and be dif|ferent
<PB N="46" REF="14">
in every different Point of the de|&s;cribed Space: Both the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable Con&s;equences of the continued Action of the Weight of the Body during the Time of its falling; and of the Ve|locity's being proportional to the &s;quare Root of the Space de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sect.</HI> 6, 7. he charges me with gi|ving an Account of Motion different from Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> <Q REND="inline"><HI>who di&s;tin|gui&s;heth two Sorts of Motion, ab&s;o|lute and relative. The former he de|fineth to be a Tran&s;lation from ab&s;o|lute Place to ab&s;olute Place, the lat|ter from one relative Place to ano|ther. Mine, which exi&s;ts in a Point, which may be conceiv'd without Space de&s;crib'd,</HI> he &s;ays<HI>, is plainly neither of the&s;e Sorts of Motion, but &s;ome third Kind, which he is at a lo&s;s to comprehend. But he can clearly com|prehend that, if we admit Motion without Space, then Sir</HI> I&s;aac New|ton<HI>'s Account of it mu&s;t be wrong: For Place by which he defines Motion is, according to him, a Part of</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="15">
<HI>Space.</HI></Q> Now in An&s;wer to this I &s;ay that all Motion, which can neither be ge|nerated nor changed but by Forces im|pre&s;s'd on a Body, nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ts in the Body it &s;elf while it continues to change its Place, and is the Quantity of Matter moved and its Velocity or Degree of Tendency forward taken together: The continual Tran&s;lation of a Body therefore into a new Place is, as I have before ob|&s;erved, an <HI>Effect</HI> of this Tendency for|ward in the Body, and not the Tenden|cy it&s;elf; con&s;equently Space de&s;crib'd is an <HI>Effect</HI> of Velocity, and not the Ve|locity it&s;elf. Velocity, according to Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> does not nece&s;&s;arily im|ply any Space de&s;cribed: And therefore, con&s;ider'd as an Effect exi&s;ting in the Body, can be nothing but the Rate or Degree of its Tendency forward, as I have proved it to be in Prop. III. Con|&s;equently I have not given a different Account of Motion from Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton,</HI> but an Account every way con&s;i&s;tent with his Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="16">
In <HI>Sect.</HI> 8. I find the following Pa&s;|&s;age tran&s;cribed from the <HI>Analy&s;t.</HI> <Q REND="inline"><HI>Ve|locity</HI> nece&s;&s;arily <HI>implies both Time and Space, and</HI> cannot <HI>be conceiv'd without them. And if the Velocities of na&s;cent and evane&s;cent Quantities, that is, ab&s;tracted from Time and Space, may not be comprehended, how can we comprehend and demon&s;trate their Proportions? or con&s;ider their</HI> rationes primae &amp; ultimae. <HI>For to con|&s;ider the Proportion or Ratio of Things, implieth that &s;uch Things have Magnitude: That &s;uch their Magnitudes may be mea&s;ur'd, and their Relations to each other known. But, as there is NO Mea&s;ure of Ve|locity except Time and Space, the Proportion of Velocities being ONLY compounded of the direct Proportion of the Spaces and the reciprocal Pro|portion of the Times; doth it not follow, that to talk of inve&s;tigating, obtaining and con&s;idering the Pro|portions of Velocities, exclu&s;ively of Time and Space, is to talk unintel|ligibly?</HI></Q> This Pa&s;&s;age I have fully
<PB N="49" REF="17">
an&s;wer'd, in having proved that there are other Mea&s;ures of Velocity be&s;ides Time and Space. I have given two general Mea&s;ures of it in the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, and one in the fifth; all of which may be clearly conceiv'd, and yet not one of them includes or implies either Space de&s;cribed or Time; and I know no general Mea&s;ure of it which does. I agree with him that to con&s;ider the Proportion or Ratio of Things implieth that &s;uch Things have Magnitude, but <Q REND="inline">to con&s;ider the fir&s;t or la&s;t Proportions of Quantities does not at all imply that &s;uch Quantities, have Magnitudes. The&s;e are not the Pro|portions of fir&s;t or la&s;t Quantities, or of any generated Magnitudes whatever, but the Proportions of the Velocities with which Quantities begin or cea&s;e to have Magnitudes.</Q></P>
<P>The next two Sections relate to the Moment of a Rectangle. If the Rect|angle CDK be generated by the Motions of two right Lines, and from a Continu|ance of their Motions be increa&s;ed by the Gnomon CGK; and if A and B are
<PB N="50" REF="18">
put for the Sides DK and DC, and a / b for the fir&s;t Ratio of their i&s;ochronal In|crements DF / DH, which fir&s;t Ratio is equal to the Ratio of the Velocities in D to|wards
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
F and H; the Moment or Muta|tion of the Rectangle CDK, will be Ab&plus;Ba, as I have fully proved in the foregoing An&s;wer. In the Augmentation of a Rectangle no Motions exi&s;t but the Motions of its Sides, which Motions, according to Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> con|&s;titute its Moment or Mutation: And if the Sides of the Rectangle EGL, flow back till they coincide with tho&s;e of the Rectangle CDK, and the gene|rated
<PB N="51" REF="19">
Gnomon CGK vani&s;hes; I have proved that the Motion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the In&s;tant of its Evane&s;cence, which is al&s;o the Moment of the Rectangle CDK, is the Sum of the Motions of the Sides of that Rectangle, or Ab&plus;Ba; and he ought either to allow it or prove the con|trary. To &s;ay that a and b mu&s;t denote the Magnitudes of the Increments DF and DH, and not their fir&s;t Ratio, or the Ratio of the Velocities in D towards F and H, is to a&s;&s;ert a manife&s;t Fal&s;hood. For the Velocities during the Pa&s;&s;age of the moving Quantities from D to F and H, may be &s;o changed that the Magni|tudes of the Increments DF and DH, &s;hall have a Proportion very different from that of the Velocities in D towards F and H: And therefore DF and DH, how &s;mall &s;oever, cannot mea&s;ure the Fluxions of DK and DC; and con&s;e|quently cannot be the Things expre&s;&s;ed by a and b.</P>
<P>In the next place he charges me with <HI>explaining Fluxions by the Ratio of</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="20">
<HI>Magnitudes infinitely dimini&s;h'd,</HI> al|though I had expre&s;ly told him, that they are not mea&s;ured or expounded by the Proportions of any generated Magnitudes whatever; but by the fir&s;t or la&s;t Propor|tions of i&s;ochronal Increments generated or de&s;troyed by Motion. The Pa&s;&s;age which occa&s;ion'd this &s;en&s;ele&s;s Notion, is contain'd in the 9th Page of the <HI>Vindi|cation,</HI> and &s;tands in the&s;e Words. <Q REND="inline">To obtain the la&s;t Ratio of &s;ynchronal In|crements, the Magnitudes of tho&s;e In|crements mu&s;t be infinitely dimini&s;h'd: For their la&s;t Ratio is the Ratio with which they vani&s;h and become no|thing.</Q> To which may be added a like Pa&s;&s;age in the 14th Page of the &s;ame <HI>Vindication,</HI> in the&s;e Words. <Q REND="inline">The Magnitudes of &s;ynchronal Increments mu&s;t be infinitely dimini&s;h'd and be|come evane&s;cent in order to obtain their fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios, to which Ra|tios the Ratios of their corre&s;ponding Fluxions are equal.</Q> Now a fair and ingenuous Reader, who had nothing at heart but the e&s;tabli&s;hing of Truth and
<PB N="53" REF="21">
Science, would ea&s;ily have collected from either of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, that I did not explain or expound Fluxions by the Ra|tio of Magnitudes infinitely dimini&s;h'd, but by the fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios of Incre|ments generated or de&s;troyed in equal Times; that is, by the Ratios of the Velocities with which tho&s;e Increments begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>In the 20th Page of the foregoing An|&s;wer, I have a&s;&s;erted, that <Q REND="inline">the fir&s;t or la&s;t Proportions of i&s;ochronal Incre|ments, &s;ub&s;i&s;t when the Increments them&s;elves have no Magnitudes; for|a&s;much as the Motions &s;ub&s;i&s;t with which tho&s;e Increments, <HI>ju&s;t now, in this very In&s;tant,</HI> begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t; to which Motions the&s;e Ratios are proportional.</Q> In An&s;wer to this the Author of the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> asks his Rea|der, <Q REND="inline"><HI>Whether the i&s;ochronal Incre|ments them&s;elves &s;ub&s;i&s;t when they have no Magnitude?

<PB N="54" REF="22">
<HI>there is no Magnitude?

<P>If the Lines AC and BE be generated by the Motions of two Points &s;etting out from A and B, and be increas'd in equal Times from a Continuance of their Motions by the Increments CD and EF; the&s;e Increments will begin to exi&s;t with the Velocities which the moving Points
<PB N="55" REF="23">
have in their initial Limits at C and E; <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> and the Ratio of tho&s;e Velo|cities will be the Ratio with which the Increments begin to exi&s;t, that is, their fir&s;t Ratio; con|&s;equently the fir&s;t Ratio of CD and EF &s;ub&s;i&s;ts when the Incre|ments them&s;elves do not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, that is, before they have acquired any Magnitude whatever. The fir&s;t Ratio of the Increments CD and EF, is not the Ratio of tho&s;e Increments, nor of any Parts of them; it is not their Ratio con|&s;idered as exi&s;ting and having finite Mag|nitudes, but the Ratio with which they begin to exi&s;t and have Magnitudes. If the Velocities in C and E be as 3 and 2, the fir&s;t Ratio of the i&s;ochronal Incre|ments CD and EF, will be the Ratio of 3 to 2, and may be expounded by any two Lines which are as 3 to 2; but tho&s;e Lines are not the Increments them&s;elves nor any Parts of them. For the Velo|cities may perpetually vary in the Pro|gre&s;s of the moving Points from C and E, to D and F; and their Variation may

be &s;uch that CD and EF, however &s;mall, may be in a very different Pro|portion from that of 3 to 2, as I have ob&s;erved above: So that the Fluxions of Lines cannot be mea&s;ured or ex|pounded by any Proportions of their i&s;o|chronal Increments, except their fir&s;t or la&s;t Proportions.</P>
<P><HI>In order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Under&s;tanding of his Corre&s;pondent he &s;ays, that in the Gene&s;is of a Rectangle by Motion, I have &s;uppos'd two Points to exi&s;t at the &s;ame Time in one Point, and to be moved different Ways without &s;tirring from that Point.</HI> This he is pleas'd to call a <HI>Riddle,</HI> and &s;ays that <HI>I have the Con|&s;cience to call it a full and clear An|&s;wer</HI> to Part of his CATECHISM. I do not indeed profe&s;s much Skill in making or explaining of <HI>Riddles,</HI> but I can &s;ee it will not be very difficult to clear this Af|fair. Let any two Lines KF and CH, inter&s;ecting each other in D, be de&s;crib'd by the Motions of two Points, &s;etting out from K and C; (<HI>See the Figure in</HI> p. 50.) and let the Velocities of the mo|ving
<PB N="57" REF="25">
Points be &s;uch, that they arrive at D exactly at the &s;ame In&s;tant of Time: Upon their Arrival in D, it is plain the two Points will exi&s;t in the Point D; which he may venture to allow, &s;ince mathe|matical Points have no Magnitude: So far the <HI>Riddle</HI> is clear. And &s;ince the two Points can exi&s;t in D, as they cer|tainly may without any Ab&s;urdity, they mu&s;t pre&s;erve their re&s;pective Velocities or Tendencies forward to F and H, and go on in the Directions DF and DH, by Virtue of tho&s;e Velocities or Tendencies, there being nothing to change or de&s;troy them: But they cannot go on in tho&s;e Directions without &s;tirring from the Point D: And therefore he has been mi&s;taken in &s;aying I &s;uppo&s;ed two Points to be moved different Ways in the &s;ame Point, without &s;tirring from that Point. Far|ther, from the Gene&s;is of the Rectangle CDK, it is obvious that the common In|ter&s;ection of the moving Lines IB and IA, in which the two Points are &s;up|po&s;ed to exi&s;t at the &s;ame Time, will continually go forward with the Lines
<PB N="58" REF="26">
them&s;elves; but it cannot continually go forward with the Lines them&s;elves unle&s;s it continually goes into a new Place. Surely this Author's Friends mu&s;t be a|&s;hamed of him for calling this a Riddle, which is plain to any one who has in the lea&s;t con&s;idered the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sect.</HI> 14. he hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;es <HI>he does not under&s;tand Sir</HI> I&s;aac<HI>'s Doctrine &s;o far as to frame a po&s;itive Idea of his Fluxions; and yet from certain nega|tive Conceptions thereof</HI> he takes upon him to &s;ay <HI>that by the Gene&s;is of a Cube I have not explain'd the Nature of &s;e|cond, third and fourth Fluxions in a Way agreeable to that Doctrine.</HI> But in this he is mi&s;taken. For (by <HI>Lem.</HI> 2. <HI>L.</HI> 2. <HI>Princip. Newt.</HI>) if A flows with an uni|form Velocity expre&s;s'd by a, 3aA^2 is the Moment of A^3, 6a^2A the Moment of 3aA^2, 6a^3 the Moment of 6a^2A, and o the Moment of 6a^3: But according to Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> the Moment of the Moment of A^3, is the &s;econd Moment of A^3; the Moment of that &s;econd Moment, is its
<PB N="59" REF="27">
third Moment; and the Moment of the third Moment, is its fourth Moment: And therefore 3aA^2, 6a^2 A, 6a^3 and o, are the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, and fourth Moments of A^3. Farther, I have &s;hewn that all the&s;e Moments or Motions exi&s;t and may be clearly and di&s;tinctly conceiv'd, in the In&s;tant that a Cube generated by an uni|form Motion, begins to be increas'd by a Continuance of that Motion: And there|fore in the Sy&s;tem of Motion whereby a Cube begins to be augmented, I have gi|ven an Explanation of fir&s;t, &s;econd and third Fluxions every way agreeable to Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Doctrine: And he ought either to allow it or &s;hew the contrary.</P>
<P>He tells his Reader (Sect. 17.) that in &s;aying there can be no fourth Fluxion of a Cube, <HI>I make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s di|rectly to overthrow Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton<HI>'s Doctrine. For if there can be no fourth Fluxion of a Cube, there can be no &s;e|cond Fluxion of a Line, and</HI> a fortiori, <HI>no third, fourth or fifth Fluxion.</HI> Here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd that one Circum&s;tance
<PB N="60" REF="28">
which I particularly &s;uppos'd, has not been attended to; and by not attending to it, the Reader is made to believe that, according to the Account I have given of Fluxions, there can be no &s;econd, third or fourth Fluxion of a Line. Now, in the 25th Page of the foregoing An&s;wer, I &s;uppos'd the Cube to be generated by an UN'FORM Motion; in which Ca&s;e the Ve|locity expre&s;s'd by a, will be a given Quantity: But there can be <HI>no kind</HI> of Mutation or Change of a Velocity which is given; and con&s;equently no &s;econd Fluxion of a Line, nor any fourth Flux|ion of a Cube, which increa&s;es with &s;uch a Velocity. In this therefore I have not endeavoured <HI>directly to overthrow Sir</HI> I&s;aac<HI>'s Doctrine</HI>; <HI>I have not, to the great Relief of the learned World, de&s;troy'd an indefinite Rank of Fluxions of diffe|rent Orders</HI>; nor have I given an Account of them any way incon&s;i&s;tent with Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Doctrine, as this Author has fal&s;e|ly a&s;&s;erted.</P>

He &s;ays, <HI>Sect.</HI> 18. that <HI>I give up Sir</HI> I&s;aac<HI>'s Doctrine of Fluxions, and in|&s;tead thereof humorou&s;ly &s;ub&s;titute what all the World knew before he was born, to wit, the three Dimen&s;ions of a Cube and the Gene&s;is thereof by Motion.</HI> But this is a Mi&s;take. For I neither give up the Doctrine of Fluxions, nor &s;ub&s;titute the Gene&s;is of a Cube by Motion in&s;tead of it: I did not introduce that Gene&s;is in order to &s;et a&s;ide the Doctrine of Flux|ions; but to exhibit a Sy&s;tem of Motion which might explain and illu&s;trate fir&s;t, &s;econd and third Fluxions, &s;o as to make their Exi&s;tence conceivable to the mean|e&s;t Capacity; and thereby to expo&s;e the Weakne&s;s and Ignorance of this Writer: And I have &s;ucceeded in both; although to his <HI>di&s;cerning Eye</HI> it may &s;eem to be a <HI>di&s;gui&s;ing and betraying and giving up the Doctrine.</HI> According to that Doc|trine, the Fluxions and Moments of ge|nerated Quantities, are the Velocities and Motions with which the i&s;ochronal Incre|ments of tho&s;e Quantities begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t; and though the Generation of

<P>In <HI>Sect.</HI> 20. <HI>He intreats me to ex|plain whether Sir</HI> I&s;aac<HI>'s Momentum be a finite Quantity, or an Infinite&s;imal, or a mere Limit.</HI> I tell him, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s <HI>Momentum</HI> is a FINITE QUANTITY; it is a Product contained under the mo|ving Quantity and its Velocity, or un|der the moving Quantity and fir&s;t Ratio of the Space de&s;cribed by it in a given Particle of Time; the Velocity being mea&s;ur'd by the fir&s;t Ratio of that Space. Now the Velocity of the moving Quan|tity, and fir&s;t Ratio of the Space de|&s;cribed by it in a given Particle of Time,
<PB N="63" REF="31">
being both of them <HI>finite</HI> Quantities, may both be expre&s;s'd by one and the &s;ame Line of a <HI>finite</HI> Magnitude; but that Line does not exi&s;t in the Quantity gene|rated or augmented by Motion. The moving Quantity exi&s;ts both in the Flu|ent and in the Increment of that Fluent, being the final Limit of the former and the initial Limit of the latter: But the Line which expre&s;&s;es the Velocity, or fir&s;t Ratio of the Space de&s;cribed by the moving Quantity in a given Particle of Time, does not exi&s;t either in the Fluent or in its Increment. By Moments there|fore he is not to under&s;tand generated In|crements of Fluents, but certain FINITE PRODUCTS OR QUANTITIES of a very dif|ferent Nature from generated Increments, expre&s;&s;ing only the Motions with which tho&s;e Increments begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t.</P>
