<BIBL>MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the evening, when Emily was at length
informed, that Count De Villefort reque&s;ted
to &s;ee her, &s;he gue&s;&s;ed that Valancourt was
below, and, endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume com|po&s;ure
and to recollect all her &s;pirits, &s;he
ro&s;e and left the apartment; but on reach|ing
the door of the library, where &s;he ima|gined
him to be, her emotion returned with
<PB N="2" REF="4">
&s;uch energy, that, fearing to tru&s;t her&s;elf in
the room, The returned into the hall, where
&s;he continued for a con&s;iderable time, un|able
to command her agitated &s;pirits.</P>
<P>When &s;he could recall them, &s;he found in
the library Valancourt, &s;eated with the Count,
who both ro&s;e on her entrance; but &s;he did
not dare to look at Valancourt, and the
Count, having led her to a chair, immediate|ly
withdrew.</P>
<P>Emily remained with her eyes fixed
on the floor, under &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion of
heart, that &s;he could not &s;peak, and with
difficulty breathed; while Valancourt threw
him&s;elf into a chair be&s;ide her, and, &s;ighing
heavily, continued &s;ilent, when, had &s;he
rai&s;ed her eyes, &s;he would have perceived
the violent emotions, with which he was
agitated.</P>
<P>At length, in a tremulous voice, he &s;aid,
"I have &s;olicited to &s;ee you this evening,
that I might, at lea&s;d, be &s;pared the further
torture of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which your altered
manner had occa&s;ioned me, and which the
<PB N="3" REF="5">
hints I have ju&s;t received from the Count
have in part explained. I perceive I have
enemies, Emily, who envied me my late
happine&s;s, and who have been bu&s;y in
&s;earching out the means to de&s;troy it: I
perceive, too, that time and ab&s;ence have
weakened the affection you once felt. for
me, and that you can now ea&s;ily be taught
to forget me."</P>
<P>His la&s;t words faltered, and Emily, le&s;s
able to &s;peak than before, continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"O what a meeting is this!" exclaimed
Valancourt, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, and pac|ing
the room with hurried &s;teps, "what a
meeting is this, a&s;ter our long&mdash;long &s;epa|ration!"
Again he &s;at down, and, after the
&s;truggle of a moment, he added in a firm
but de&s;pairing tone, "This is too much&mdash;I
cannot bear it! Emily, will you not &s;peak
to me?"</P>
<P>He covered his face with his hand, as if
to conceal his emotion, and took Emily's,
which &s;he did not withdraw. Her tears
could no longer be re&s;trained; and, when
<PB N="4" REF="6">
he rai&s;ed his eyes and perceived that &s;he
was weeping, all his tenderne&s;s returned,
and a gleam of hope appeared to cro&s;s his
mind, for he exclaimed, "O! you do pity
me, then, you do love me! Yes, you are
&s;till my own Emily&mdash;let me believe tho&s;e
tears, that tell me &s;o!"</P>
<P>Emily now made an effort to recover her
firmne&s;s, and, ha&s;tily drying them, "Yes,"
&s;aid &s;he, "I do pity you&mdash;I weep for you&mdash;but,
ought I to think of you with affec|tion?
You may remember, that ye&s;ter-even|ing
I &s;aid, I had &s;till &s;ufficient confidence
in your candour to believe, that, when I
&s;hould reque&s;t an explanation of your
words, you would give it. This explana|tion
is now unnece&s;&s;ary, I under&s;tand them
too well; but prove, at lea&s;t, that your
candour is de&s;erving of the confidence I
give it, when I a&s;k you, whether you are
con&s;cious of being the &s;ame e&s;timable Valan|court&mdash;whom
I once loved."</P>
<P>"Once loved!" cried he,&mdash;"the &s;ame&mdash;the
&s;ame!" He pau&s;ed in extreme emotion,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and then added, in a voice at once &s;olemn,
and dejected,&mdash;"No&mdash;I am not the &s;ame!&mdash;I
am lo&s;t&mdash;I am no longer worthy of
you!"</P>
<P>He again concealed his face. Emily was
too much affected by this hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion
to reply immediately, and, while &s;he &s;trug|gled
to overcome the pleadings of her heart,
and to act with the deci&s;ive firmne&s;s, which
was nece&s;&s;ary for her future peace, &s;he per|ceived
all the danger of tru&s;ting long to her
re&s;olution, in the pretence of Valancourt,
and was anxious to conclude an interview,
that tortured them both; yet, when &s;he
con&s;idered, that this was probably their la&s;t
meeting, her fortitude &s;unk at Once, and
&s;he experienced only emotions of tenderne&s;s
and of de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Valancourt, meanwhile, lo&s;t in emotions
of remor&s;e and grief, which he had neither
the power, or the will to expre&s;s, &s;at in&s;en|&s;ible
almo&s;t of the pre&s;ence of Emily, his
features &s;till concealed, and his brea&s;t agi|tated
by convul&s;ive &s;ighs.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
"Spare me the nece&s;&s;ity," &s;aid Emily, re|collecting
her fortitude, "&s;pare me the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of mentioning tho&s;e circum&s;tances of
your conduct, which oblige me to break
our connection forever.&mdash;We mu&s;t part, I
now &s;ee you for the la&s;t time."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" cried Valancourt, rou&s;ed
from his deep &s;ilence, "You cannot mean
what you &s;ay!&mdash;you cannot mean to throw
me from you forever!"</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t part," repeated Emily, with
empha&s;is,&mdash;"and that forever! Your own
conduct has made this nece&s;&s;ary,"</P>
<P>"This is the Count's determination,"
&s;aid he haughtily, "not yours, and I &s;hall
enquire by what authority he interferes be|tween
us." He now ro&s;e, and walked
about the room in great emotion.</P>
<P>"Let me &s;ave you from this error," &s;aid
Emily, not le&s;s agitated&mdash;"it is my deter|mination,
and, if you reflect a moment on
your late conduct, you will perceive, that
my future peace requires it."</P>
<P>"Your future peace requires, that we
<PB N="7" REF="9">
&s;hould part&mdash;part forever!" &s;aid Valan|court,
"How little did I ever expect to
hear you &s;ay &s;o!"</P>
<P>"And how little did I expect, that it
would be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay &s;o!" re|joined
Emily, while her. voice &s;oftened into
tenderne&s;s, and her tears flowed again.&mdash;"That
you&mdash;you, Valancourt, would ever
fall from my e&s;teem!"</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent a moment, as if over|whelmed
by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of no longer
de&s;erving this e&s;teem, as well as the certain|ty
of having lo&s;t it, and then, with impa&s;|&s;ioned
grief, lamented the criminality of his
late conduct and the mi&s;ery to which it had
reduced him, till, overcome by a recollec|tion
of the pa&s;t and a conviction of the
future, he bur&s;t into tears, and uttered only
deep and broken &s;ighs.</P>
<P>The remor&s;e he had expre&s;&s;ed, and the
di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered could not be witne&s;&s;ed
by Emily with indifference, and, had &s;he
not called to her recollection all the cir|cum&s;tances,
of which Count De Villefort had
<PB N="8" REF="10">
informed her, and all he had &s;aid of the
danger of confiding in repentance, formed
under the influence of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he might
perhaps have tru&s;ted to the a&s;&s;urances of her
heart, and have forgotten his mi&s;conduct in
the tenderne&s;s, which that repentance ex|cited.</P>
<P>Valancourt, returning to the chair be&s;ide,
her, at length, &s;aid, in a calm voice, "'Tis
true, I am fallen&mdash;fallen from my own e&s;|teem!
but could you, Emily, &s;o &s;oon, &s;o
&s;uddenly re&s;ign, if you had not before cea&s;ed
to love me, or, if your conduct was not
governed by the de&s;igns, I will &s;ay, the &s;elf|i&s;h
de&s;igns of another per&s;on! Would you
not otherwi&s;e be willing to hope for my re|formation&mdash;and
could you bear, by e&s;tran|ging
me from you, to abandon me to mi|&s;ery&mdash;to
my&s;elf!"&mdash;Emily wept aloud.&mdash;"No,
Emily&mdash;no&mdash;you would not do this,
if you &s;till loved me. You would find
your own happine&s;s in &s;aving mine."</P>
<P>"There are too many probabilities
again&s;t that hope," &s;aid E.mily, "to ju&s;|tify
<PB N="9" REF="11">
me in tru&s;ting the comfort of my whole
life to it. May I not al&s;o a&s;k, whether
you could wi&s;h me to do this, if you really
loved me?"</P>
<P>"Really loved you!" exclaimed Valan|court&mdash;"is
it po&s;&s;ible you can doubt my
love! Yet it is rea&s;onable, that you &s;hould
do &s;o, &s;ince you &s;ee, that I am le&s;s ready to
&s;uffer the horror of parting with you, than
that of involving you in my ruin. Yes,
Emily&mdash;I am ruined&mdash;irreparably ruined&mdash;I
am involved in debts, which I can never
discharge!" Valancourt's look, which was
wild, as he &s;poke this, &s;oon &s;ettled into an
expre&s;&s;ion of gloomy de&s;pair; and Emily,
while &s;he was compelled to admire his &s;in|cerity,
&s;aw, with unutterable angui&s;h, new
rea&s;ons for fear in the &s;uddenne&s;s of his feel|ings
and the extent of the mi&s;ery, in which
they might involve him. After &s;ome
minutes, &s;he &s;eemed to contend again&s;t her
grief and to &s;truggle for fortitude to con|clude
the interview. I will not prolong the&s;e
moments," &s;aid &s;he, "by a conver&s;ation,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
which can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e. Va|lancourt,
farewell!"</P>
<P>"You are not going?" &s;aid he, wildly
interrupting her&mdash;"You will not leave me
thus&mdash;you will not abandon me even be|fore
my mind has &s;ugge&s;ted any po&s;&s;ibility
of compromi&s;e between the la&s;t indulgence of
my de&s;pair and the endurance of my lo&s;s!"
Emily was terrified by the &s;ternne&s;s of his
look, and &s;aid, in a &s;oothing voice, "You
have your&s;elf acknowledged, that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
we mould part;&mdash;if you wi&s;h, that
I &s;hould believe you love me, you will re|peat
the acknowledgment."&mdash;"Never&mdash;never,"
cried he&mdash;"I was di&s;tracted when
I made it. O! Emily&mdash;this is too much;&mdash;though
you are not deceived as to my
faults, you mu&s;t be deluded into this ex|a&s;peration
again&s;t them. The Count is the
barrier between us; but he &s;hall not long
remain &s;o."</P>
<P>"You are, indeed, di&s;tracted," &s;aid
Emily, "the Count is not your enemy; on
the contrary, he is my friend, and that
<PB N="11" REF="13">
might, in &s;ome degree, induce you to con|&s;ider
him as yours."&mdash;"Your friend!" &s;aid
Valancourt, ha&s;tily, "how long has he
been your friend, that he can &s;o ea&s;ily make
you forget your lover? Was it he, who re|commended
to your favour the Mon&s;ieur
Dupont, who, you &s;ay, accompanied you
from Italy, and who, I &s;ay, has &s;tolen your
affections? But I have no right to que&s;tion
you;&mdash;you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s. Du|pont,
perhaps, may not long triumph over
my fallen fortunes! Emily, more frightened
than before by the frantic looks of Valan|court,
&s;aid, in a tone &s;carcely audible,
"For heaven's &s;ake be rea&s;onable&mdash;be com|po&s;ed.
Mon&s;ieur Dupont is not your rival,
nor is the Count his advocate. You have
no rival; nor, except your&s;elf, an enemy.
My heart is wrung with angui&s;h, which mu&s;t
increa&s;e while your frantic behaviour &s;hews
me, more than ever, that you are no longer
the Valancourt I have been accu&s;tomed to
love."</P>
<P>He made no reply, but &s;at with his arms
<PB N="12" REF="14">
re&s;ted on the table and his face concealed
by his hands; while Emily &s;tood, &s;ilent and
trembling, wretched for her&s;elf and dread|ing
to leave him in this &s;tate of mind.</P>
<P>"O exce&s;s of mi&s;ery!" he &s;uddenly ex|claimed,
"that I can never lament my &s;uf|ferings,
without accu&s;ing my&s;elf, nor re|member
you, without recollecting the folly
and the vice, by which I have lo&s;t you!
Why was I forced to Paris, and why did
I yield to allurements, which were to make
me de&s;picable for ever! O! why cannot I
look back, without interruption, to tho&s;e
days of innocence and peace, the days of
our early love!"&mdash;The recollection &s;eem|ed
to melt his heart, and the frenzy of de|&s;pair
yielded to tears. After a long pau&s;e,
turning towards her and taking her hand,
he &s;aid, in a &s;oftened voice, "Emily, can
you bear that we &s;hould part&mdash;can you re|&s;olve
to give up an heart, that loves you like
mine&mdash;an heart, which, though it has
erred&mdash;widely erred, is not irretrievable
from error, as you well know, it never can
<PB N="13" REF="15">
be retrievable from love?" Emily made no
reply, but with her tears. "Can you,"
continued he, "can you forget all our
former days of happine&s;s and confidence&mdash;when
I had not a thought, that I might
wi&s;h to conceal from you&mdash;when I had no
ta&s;te&mdash;no plea&s;ures, in which you did not
participate?"</P>
<P>"O do not lead me to the remembrance
of tho&s;e days," &s;aid Emily, "unle&s;s you
can teach me to forget the pre&s;ent; I do
not mean to reproach you; if I did, I
&s;hould be &s;pared the&s;e tears; but why will
you render your pre&s;ent &s;ufferings more
con&s;picuous, by contra&s;ting them with your
former virtues?"</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e virtues," &s;aid Valancourt,
"might, perhaps, again be mine, if your
affection, which nurtured them, was un|changed;&mdash;but
I fear, indeed, I &s;ee, that
you can no longer love me; el&s;e the happy
hours, which we have pa&s;&s;ed together, would
plead for me, and you could not look back
upon them unmoved. Yet, why &s;hould I
<PB N="14" REF="16">
torture my&s;elf with the remembrance&mdash;why
do I linger here? Am I not ruined&mdash;would
it not be madne&s;s to involve you in
my misfortunes, even if your heart was &s;till
my own? I will not di&s;tre&s;s you further.
Yet, before I go," added he, in a &s;olemn
voice, "let me repeat, that, whatever may|be
my de&s;tiny&mdash;whatever I may be doomed
to &s;uffer, I mu&s;t always love you&mdash;mo&s;t
fondly love you! I am going, Emily, I am
going to leave you&mdash;to leave you, forever!"
As he &s;poke the la&s;t words, his voice trem|bled,
and he threw him&s;elf again into the
chair, from which he had ri&s;en. Emily
was utterly unable to leave the room, or
to &s;ay farewell. All impre&s;&s;ion of his cri|minal
conduct and almo&s;t of his follies was
obliterated from her mind, and &s;he was &s;en|&s;ible
only of pity and grief.</P>
<P>"My fortitude is gone," &s;aid Valancourt
at length; "I can no longer even &s;truggle
to recall it. I cannot now leave you&mdash;I
cannot bid you an eternal farewell; &s;ay, at
lea&s;t, that you will &s;ee me once again."
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Emily's heart was &s;omewhat relieved by
the reque&s;t, and &s;he endeavoured to be|lieve,
that &s;he ought not to refu&s;e it. Yet
&s;he was embarra&s;&s;ed by recollecting, that
&s;he was a vi&s;itor in the hou&s;e of the Count,
who could not be plea&s;ed by the return of
Valancourt. Other con&s;iderations, how|ever,
&s;oon overcame this, and &s;he granted
his reque&s;t, on the condition, that he would
neither think of the Count, as his enemy,
nor Dupont as his rival. He then left
her, with a heart, &s;o much lightened by
this &s;hort re&s;pite, that he almo&s;t lo&s;t every
former &s;en&s;e of misfortune.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew to her own room, that &s;he
might compote her &s;pirits and remove the
traces of her tears, which would encourage
the cen&s;orious remarks of the Counte&s;s and
her favourite, as well as excite the curio&s;ity
of the re&s;t of the family. She found it, how|ever,
impo&s;&s;ible to tranquillize her mind,
from which &s;he could not expel the remem|brance
of the late &s;cene with Valancourt, or
<PB N="16" REF="18">
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;he was to &s;ee him
again, on the morrow. This meeting now
appeared more terrible to her than the la&s;t,
for the ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion he had made
of his ill conduct and his embarra&s;&s;ed cir|cum&s;tances,
with the &s;trength and tenderne&s;s
of affection, which this confe&s;&s;ion di&s;covered,
had deeply impre&s;&s;ed her, and, in &s;pite of
all &s;he had heard and believed to his di&s;ad|vantage,
her e&s;teem began to return. It fre|quently
appeared to her impo&s;&s;ible, that he
could have been guilty of the depravities,
reported of him, which, if not incon&s;i&s;tent
with his warmth and impetuo&s;ity, were en|tirely
&s;o with his candour and &s;en&s;ibility.
Whatever was the criminality, which had
given ri&s;e to the reports, &s;he could not now
believe them to be wholly true, nor that his
heart was finally clo&s;ed again&s;t the charms
of virtue. The deep con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which
he felt as well as expre&s;&s;ed of his errors,
&s;eemed to ju&s;tify the opinion; and, as &s;he un|der&s;tood
not the instability of youthful di&s;|po&s;itions,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
po&s;itions, when oppo&s;ed by habit, and that
pro&s;e&s;&s;ions frequently deceive tho&s;e, who
make, as well as tho&s;e, who hear them, &s;he
might have yielded to the flattering per&s;ua|&s;ions
of her own heart and the pleadings of
Valancourt, had &s;he not been guided by the
&s;uperior prudence of the Count. He repre|&s;ented
to her, in a clear light, the danger of
her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, that of li&s;tening to
promi&s;es of amendment, made under the in|fluence
of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, and the &s;light hope,
which could attach to a connection, who&s;e
chance of happine&s;s re&s;ted upon the retrie|val
of ruined circum&s;tances and the reform
of corrupted habits. On the&s;e accounts, he
lamented, that Emily had con&s;ented to a &s;e|cond
interview, for he &s;aw how much it
would &s;hake her re&s;olution and increa&s;e the
difficulty of her conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Her mind was now &s;o entirely occupied
by nearer intere&s;ts, that &s;he forgot the old
hou&s;ekeeper and the promi&s;ed hi&s;tory, which
&s;o lately had excited her curio&s;ity, but which
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Doroth&eacute;e was probably not very anxious to
di&s;clo&s;e, for night came; the hours pa&s;&s;ed;
and &s;he did not appear in Emily's chamber.
With the latter it was a &s;leeple&s;s and di&s;mal
night; the more &s;he &s;uffered her memory
to dwell on the late &s;cenes with Valancourt,
the more her re&s;olution declined, and &s;he
was obliged to recollect all the arguments,
which the Count had made u&s;e of to
&s;trengthen it, and all the precepts, which &s;he
had received from her decea&s;ed father, on
the &s;ubject of &s;elf-command, to enable her
to act, with prudence and dignity, on this
the mo&s;t &s;evere occa&s;ion of her life. There
were moments, when all her fortitude for|&s;ook
her, and when, remembering the con|fidence
of former times, &s;he thought it im|po&s;&s;ible,
that &s;he could renounce Valan|court.
His reformation then appeared cer|tain;
the arguments of Count De Villefort
were forgotten; &s;he readily believed all &s;he
wi&s;hed, and was willing to encounter any
evil, rather than that of an immediate &s;e|paration.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
Thus pa&s;&s;ed the night in ineffectual &s;trug|gles
between affection and rea&s;on, and &s;he
ro&s;e, in the morning, with a mind, weakened
and irre&s;olute, and a frame, trembling with
illne&s;s.</P>

<P>VALANCOURT, meanwhile, &s;uffered the
tortures of remor&s;e and de&s;pair. The &s;ight
of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with
which he fir&s;t loved her, and which had &s;uf|fered
a temporary abatement from ab&s;ence
and the pa&s;&s;ing &s;cenes of bu&s;y life. When, on
the receipt of her letter, he &s;et out for Lan|guedoc,
he then knew, that his own folly
had involved him in ruin, and it was no part
of his de&s;ign to conceal this from her. But
he lamented only the delay which his ill-conduct
mu&s;t give to their marriage, and did
not fore&s;ee, that the information could in|duce
her to break their connection forever.
While the pro&s;pect of this &s;eparation over|whelmed
his mind, before &s;tung with &s;elf-reproach,
he awaited their &s;econd inter|view,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
in a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction,
yet was &s;till inclined to hope, that his plead|ings
might prevail upon her not to exact
it. In the morning, he &s;ent to know at
what hour &s;he would &s;ee him; and his note
arrived, when &s;he was with the Count, who
had &s;ought an opportunity of again conver|&s;ing
with her of Valancourt; for he per|ceived
the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of her mind,
and feared, more than ever, that her forti|tude
would de&s;ert her. Emily having di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
the me&s;&s;enger, the Count returned to
the &s;ubject of their late conver&s;ation, urging
his fear of Valancourt's entreaties, and again
pointing out to her the lengthened mi&s;ery,
that mu&s;t en&s;ue, if &s;he &s;hould refu&s;e to en|counter
&s;ome pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s. His re|peated
arguments could, indeed, alone have
protected her from the affection &s;he &s;till felt
for Valancourt, and &s;he re&s;olved to be go|verned
by them.</P>
<P>The hour of interview, at length, arrived.
Emily went to it, at lea&s;t, with compo&s;ure
of manner, but Valancourt was &s;o much
<PB N="22" REF="24">
agitated, that he could not &s;peak, for &s;everal
minutes, and his fir&s;t words were alternately
tho&s;e of lamentation, entreaty and &s;elf-re|proach.
Afterward, he &s;aid, "Emily, I have
loved you&mdash;I do love you, better than my life;
but I am ruined by my own conduct. Yet
I would &s;eek to entangle you in a connec|tion,
that mu&s;t be mi&s;erable for you, rather
than &s;ubject my&s;elf to the puni&s;hment,
which is my due, the lo&s;s of you. I am a
wretch, but I will be a villain no longer.&mdash;I
will not endeavour to &s;hake your re&s;olu|tion
by the pleadings of a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion. I
re&s;ign you, Emily, and will endeavour to
find con&s;olation in con&s;idering, that, though
I am mi&s;erable, you, at lea&s;t, may be happy.
The merit of the &s;acrifice is, indeed, not
my own, for I &s;hould never have attained
&s;trength of mind to &s;urrender you, if your
prudence had not demanded it."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a moment, while Emily at|tempted
to conceal the tears, which came to
her eyes. She would have &s;aid, "You
&s;peak now, as you were wont to do," but
<PB N="23" REF="25">
&s;he checked her&s;elf.&mdash;"Forgive me, Emi|ly,"
&s;aid he, "all the &s;ufferings I have oc|ca&s;ioned
you, and, &s;ometimes, when you
think of the wretched Valancourt, remem|ber,
that his only con&s;olation would be to
believe, that you are no longer unhappy by
his folly." The tears now fell fa&s;t upon her
cheek, and he was relap&s;ing into the phren&s;y
of de&s;pair, when Emily endeavoured to re|call
her fortitude and to terminate an inter|view,
which only &s;eemed to increa&s;e the di&s;|tre&s;s
of both. Perceiving her tears and that
&s;he was ri&s;ing to go, Valancourt &s;truggled,
once more, to overcome his own feelings
and to &s;ooth hers. "The remembrance
of this &s;orrow," &s;aid he, "&s;hall in future
be my protection. O! never again will ex|ample,
or temptation have power to &s;educe
me to evil, exalted as I &s;hall be by the re|collection
of your grief for me."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;omewhat comforted by this
a&s;&s;urance. "We are now parting for ever,"
&s;aid &s;he; "but, if my happine&s;s is dear to
you, you will always remember, that no|thing
<PB N="24" REF="26">
can contribute to it more, than to be|lieve,
that you have recovered your own e&s;|teem."
Valancourt took her hand;&mdash;his eyes
were covered with tears, and the farewell he
would have &s;poken was lo&s;t in &s;ighs. After a
few moments, Emily &s;aid, with difficulty and
emotion, "Farewell, Valancourt, may you
be happy!" She repeated her "farewell,"
and attempted to withdraw her hand, but
he &s;till held it and bathed it with his tears.
"Why prolong the&s;e moments?" &s;aid Emily,
in a voice &s;carcely audible, "they are too
painful to us both." "This is too&mdash;too
much," exclaimed Valancourt, re&s;igning her
hand and throwing him&s;elf into a chair,
where he covered his face with his hands
and was overcome, for &s;ome moments, by
convul&s;ive &s;ighs. After a long pau&s;e, du|ring
which Emily wept in &s;ilence, and Va|lancourt
&s;eemed &s;truggling with his grief,
&s;he again ro&s;e to take leave of him. Then,
endeavouring to recover his compo&s;ure, "I
am again afflicting you," &s;aid he, "but let
the angui&s;h I &s;uffer plead for me." He
<PB N="25" REF="27">
then added, in a &s;olemn voice, which fre|quently
trembled with the agitation of his
heart, "Farewell, Emily, you will always be
the only object of my tenderne&s;s. Sometimes
you will think of the unhappy Valancourt,
and it will be with pity, though it may not
be with e&s;teem. O! what is the whole
world to me, without you&mdash;without your
e&s;teem!" He checked him&s;elf&mdash;"I am
falling again into the error I have ju&s;t la|mented.
I mu&s;t not intrude longer upon
your patience, or I &s;hall relap&s;e into de|&s;pair."</P>
<P>He once more bade Emily adieu, pre&s;&s;ed
her hand to his lips, looked at her,
for the la&s;t time, and hurried out of the
room.</P>
<P>Emily remained in the chair, where he
had left her, oppre&s;&s;ed with a pain at her
heart, which &s;carcely permitted her to
breathe, and li&s;tening to his departing &s;teps,
&s;inking fainter and fainter, as he cro&s;&s;ed
the hall. She was, at length, rou&s;ed by the
<PB N="26" REF="28">
voice of the Counte&s;s in the garden, and,
her attention being then awakened, the
fir&s;t object, which &s;truck her &s;ight, was the
vacant chair, where Valancourt had &s;at. The
tears, which had been, for &s;ome time, repre&s;&s;|ed
by the kind of a&s;toni&s;hment, that fol|lowed
his departure&punc; now came to her relief,
and &s;he was, at length, &s;ufficiently compo&s;cd
to return to her own room.</P>

<P>WE now return to the mention of
Montoni, who&s;e rage and di&s;appointment
were &s;oon lo&s;t in nearer intere&s;ts, than any,
which the unhappy Emily had awakened.
His depredations having exceeded their u&s;ual
limits, and reached an extent, at which neither
the timidity of the then-commercial &s;enate
of Venice, nor their hope of his occa&s;ional
a&s;&s;i&s;tance would permit them to connive,
the &s;ame effort, it was re&s;olved, &s;hould com|plete
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his power and the
correction of his outrages. While a corps
of con&s;iderable &s;trength was upon the point
of receiving orders to march for Udolpho,
a young officer, prompted partly by re&s;ent|ment,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
for &s;ome injury, received from Mon|toni,
and partly by the hope of di&s;tinction,
&s;olicited an interview with the Mini&s;ter,
who directed the enterpri&s;e. To him he
repre&s;ented, that the &s;ituation of Udolpho
rendered it too &s;trong to be taken by open
force, except after &s;ome tedious operations;
that Montoni had lately &s;hewn how capable
he was of adding to its &s;trength all the ad|vantages,
which could be derived from the
&s;kill of a commander; that &s;o con&s;iderable
a body of troops, as that allotted to the
expedition, could not approach Udolpho
without his knowledge, and that it was not
for the honour of the republic to have a
large part of its regular force employed,
for &s;uch a time as the &s;iege of Udolpho
would require, upon the attack of a hand|ful
of banditti. The object of the expedi|tion,
he thought, might be accompli&s;hed
much more &s;afely and &s;peedily by mingling
contrivance with force. It was po&s;&s;ible to
meet Montoni and his party, without their
walls, and to attack them then; or, by ap|proaching
<PB N="29" REF="31">
the fortre&s;s, with the &s;ecrecy, con|&s;i&s;tent
with the march of &s;maller bodies of
troops, to take advantage either of the
treachery, or negligence of &s;ome of his
party, and to ru&s;h unexpectedly upon the
whole even in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho.</P>
<P>This advice was &s;eriou&s;ly attended to, and
the officer, who gave it, received the com|mand
of the troops, demanded for his pur|po&s;e.
His fir&s;t efforts were accordingly tho&s;e
of contrivance alone. In the neighbour|hood
of Udolpho, he waited, till he had &s;ecu|red
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal of the condottieri,
of whom he found none, that he addre&s;&s;ed,
unwilling to puni&s;h their imperious ma&s;ter
and to &s;ecure their own pardon from the &s;enate.
He learned al&s;o the number of Montoni's
troops, and that it had been much increa&s;ed,
&s;ince his late &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The conclu&s;ion of
his plan was &s;oon effected. Having returned
with his party, who received the watch-word
and other a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their friends with|in,
Montoni and his officers were &s;urpri&s;ed
by one divi&s;ion, who had been directed to
<PB N="30" REF="32">
their apartment, while the other maintained
the &s;light combat, which preceded the &s;ur|render
of the whole garri&s;on. Among the
per&s;ons, &s;eized with Montoni, was Or&s;ino,
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who had joined him on his fir&s;t
arrival at Udolpho, and whole concealment
had been made known to the &s;enate by
Count Morano, after the un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempt
of the latter to carry off Emily. It
was, indeed, partly for the purpo&s;e of cap|turing
this man, by whom one of the &s;enate
had been murdered, that the expedition
was undertaken, and its &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o ac|ceptable
to them, that Morano was in&s;tantly
relea&s;ed, notwithstanding the political &s;u&s;pi|cions,
which Montoni, by his &s;ecret accu|&s;ation,
had excited again&s;t him. The ce|lerity
and ea&s;e, with which this whole tran&s;|action
was completed, prevented it from at|tracting
curio&s;ity, or even from obtaining
a place in any of the publi&s;hed records of
that time; &s;o that Emily, who remained in
Languedoc, was ignorant of the defeat and
&s;ignal humiliation of her late per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">
Her mind was now occupied with &s;uf|ferings,
which no effort of rea&s;on had yet been
able to controul. Count de Villefort, who
&s;incerely attempted whatever benevolence
could &s;ugge&s;t for &s;oftening them, &s;ometimes
allowed her the &s;olitude &s;he wi&s;hed for,
&s;ometimes led her into friendly parties, and
con&s;tantly protected her, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble,
from the &s;hrewd enquiries and critical
conver&s;ation of the Counte&s;s. He often in|vited
her to make excur&s;ions, with him and
his daughter, during which he conver&s;ed
entirely on que&s;tions, &s;uitable to her ta&s;te,
without appearing to con&s;ult it, and thus
endeavoured gradually to withdraw her
from the &s;ubject of her grief, and to awake
other intere&s;ts in her mind. Emily, to
whom he appeared as the enlightened friend
and protector of her youth, &s;oon felt for him
the tender affection of a daughter, and her
heart expanded to her young friend Blanche,
as to a &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e kindne&s;s and &s;implicity
compen&s;ated for the want of more brilliant
qualities. It was long before &s;he could &s;uf|ficiently
<PB N="32" REF="34">
ab&s;tract her mind from Valancourt
to li&s;ten to the &s;tory, promi&s;ed by old Do|roth&eacute;e,
concerning which her curio&s;ity had
once been &s;o deeply intere&s;ted; but Doro|th&eacute;e,
at length, reminded her of it, and
Emily de&s;ired, that &s;he would come, that
night, to her chamber.</P>
<P>Still her thoughts were employed by con|&s;iderations,
which weakened her curio&s;ity,
and Doroth&eacute;e's tap at the door, &s;oon after
twelve, &s;urpri&s;ed her almo&s;t as much as if
it had not been appointed. "I am come,
at la&s;t, lady," &s;aid &s;he; "I wonder what
it is makes my old limbs &s;hake &s;o, to|night.
I thought, once or twice, I &s;hould
have dropped, as I was a coming." Emily
&s;eated her in a chair, and de&s;ired, that &s;he
would compo&s;e her &s;pirits, before &s;he entered
upon the &s;ubject, that had brought her
thither. "Alas," &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, "it is
thinking of that, I believe, which has dis|turbed
me &s;o. In my way hither too, I
pa&s;&s;ed the chamber, where my dear lady died,
and every thing was &s;o &s;till and gloomy
<PB N="33" REF="35">
about me, that I almo&s;t fancied I &s;aw her,
as &s;he appeared upon her death-bed."</P>
<P>Emily now drew her chair near to Doro|th&eacute;e,
who went on. "It is about twenty
years &s;ince my lady Marchione&s;s came a
bride to the chateau. O! I well remember
how &s;he looked, when &s;he came into the
great hall, where we &s;ervants were all a&s;&s;em|bled
to welcome her, and how happy my
lord the Marquis &s;eemed. Ah! who would
have thought then!&mdash;But, as I was &s;aying,
ma'am&s;elle, I thought the Marchione&s;s,
with all her &s;weet looks, did not look happy
at heart, and &s;o I told my hu&s;band, and he
&s;aid it was all fancy; &s;o I &s;aid no more, but
I made my remarks, for all that. My lady
Marchione&s;s was then about your age, and,
as I have often thought, very like you.
Well! my lord the Marquis kept open
hou&s;e, for a long time, and gave &s;uch en|tertainments
and there were &s;uch gay doings
as have never been in the chateau &s;ince. I
was younger, ma'am&s;elle, then; than I
am now, and was as gay as the be&s;t of
<PB N="34" REF="36">
them. I remember I danced with Philip,
the butler, in a pink gown, with yellow
ribbons, and a coif, not &s;uch as they wear
now, but plaited high, with ribbons all about
it. It was very becoming truly;&mdash;my lord,
the Marquis, noticed me. Ah! he was a
good-natured gentleman then&mdash;who. would
have thought that he!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But the Marchione&s;s, Doroth&eacute;e," &s;aid
Emily, "you was telling me of her."</P>
<P>"O yes, my lady Marchione&s;s, I thought
&s;he did not &s;eem happy at heart, and once,
&s;oon after the marriage, I caught her crying
in her chamber; but, when &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he
dried her eyes, and pretended to &s;mile. I
did not dare then to a&s;k what was the mat|ter;
but, the next time I &s;aw her crying, I
did, and &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed;&mdash;&s;o I &s;aid
no more. I found out, &s;ome time after, how
it was. Her father, it &s;eems, had commanded
her to marry my lord, the Marquis, for his
money, and there was another nobleman, or
el&s;e a chevalier, that &s;he liked better and
that was very fond of her, and &s;he fretted
<PB N="35" REF="37">
for the lo&s;s of him, I fancy, but &s;he never
told me &s;o. My lady always tried to conceal
her tears from the Marquis, for I have often
&s;een her, after &s;he has been &s;o &s;orrowful,
look &s;o calm and &s;weet, when he came
into the room! But my lord, all of a &s;udden,
grew gloomy and fretful, and very unkind
&s;ometimes to my lady. This afflicted her
very much, as I &s;aw, for &s;he never com|plained,
and &s;he u&s;ed to try &s;o &s;weetly to
oblige him and to bring him into a good
humour, that my heart has often ached to &s;ee
it. But he u&s;ed to be &s;tubborn, and give her
har&s;h an&s;wers, and then, when &s;he found it all
in vain, &s;he would go to her own room, and
cry &s;o! I u&s;ed to hear her in the anti-room,
poor dear lady! but I &s;eldom ventured to go
to her. I u&s;ed, &s;ometimes, to think my lord
was jealous. To be &s;ure my lady was
greatly admired, but &s;he was too good to
de&s;erve &s;u&s;picion. Among the many; che|valiers,
that vi&s;ited at the chateau, there
was one, that I always thought &s;eemed ju&s;t
&s;uited for my lady; he was &s;o courteous, yet
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;o &s;pirited, and there was &s;uch a grace, as it
were, in all he did, or &s;aid. I always ob|&s;erved,
that, whenever he had been there,
the Marquis was more gloomy and my lady
more thoughtful, and it came into my head,
that this was the chevalier &s;he ought to have
married, but I never could learn for cer|tain."</P>
<P>"What was the chevalier's name Doro|th&eacute;e?"
&s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Why that I will not tell even to you,
ma'am&s;elle, for evil may come of it. I once
heard from a per&s;on, who is &s;ince dead, that
the Marchione&s;s was not in law the wife of
the Marquis, for that she had before been
privately married to the gentleman &s;he was
&s;o much attached to, and was afterwards
afraid to own it to her father, who was a very
&s;tern man; but this &s;eems very unlikely,
and I never gave much faith to it. As I
was &s;aying, the Marquis was mo&s;t out of
humour, as I thought, when the chevalier
I &s;poke of had been at the chateau, and, at
la&s;t, his ill treatment of my lady made her
<PB N="37" REF="39">
quite mi&s;erable. He would &s;ee hardly any
vi&s;itors at the ca&s;tle, and made her live almo&s;t
by her&s;elf. I was her con&s;tant attendant,
and &s;aw all &s;he &s;uffered, but &s;till &s;he never
eomplained.</P>
<P>"After matters had gone on thus, for near
a year, my lady was taken ill, and I thought
her long fretting had made her &s;o,&mdash;but,
alas! I fear it was wor&s;e than that."</P>
<P>"Wor&s;e! Doroth&eacute;e," &s;aid Emily, "can
that be po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"I fear, it was &s;o, madam, there were
&s;trange appearances! But I will only tell
what happened. My lord, the Marquis&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h, Doroth&eacute;e, what &s;ounds were
tho&s;e?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e changed countenance, and,
while they both li&s;tened, they heard, on the
&s;tillne&s;s of the night, mu&s;ic of uncommon
&s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I have &s;urely heard that voice before!"
&s;aid Emily, at length.</P>
<P>"I have often heard it, and at this &s;ame
hour," &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, &s;olemnly, "and, if &s;pirits
<PB N="38" REF="40">
ever bring mu&s;ic&mdash;that is &s;urely the mu&s;ic
of one!"</P>
<P>Emily, as the &s;ounds drew nearer, knew
them to be the &s;ame &s;he had formerly heard
at the time of her father's death, and, whether
it was the remembrance they now revived
of that melancholy event, or that &s;he was
&s;truck with &s;uper&s;titious awe, it is certain
&s;he was &s;o much affected, that &s;he had nearly
fainted.</P>
<P>"I think I once told you, madam," &s;aid
Doroth&eacute;e, "that I fir&s;t heard this mu&s;ic,
&s;oon after my lady's death! I well remem|ber
the night!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hark! it comes again!" &s;aid Emily,
"let us open the window, and li&s;ten."</P>
<P>They did &s;o; but, &s;oon, the &s;ounds
floated gradually away into di&s;tance, and all
was again &s;till; they &s;eemed to have &s;unk
among the woods, who&s;e tufted tops were
vi&s;ible upon the clear horizon, while every
other feature of the &s;cene was involved in
the night-&s;hade, which, however, allowed
<PB N="39" REF="41">
the eye an indi&s;tinct view of &s;ome objects in
the garden below.</P>
<P>As Emily leaned on the window, gazing
with a kind of thrilling awe upon the ob&s;cu|rity
beneath, and then upon the cloudle&s;s
arch above, enlightened only by the &s;tars,
Doroth&eacute;e, in a low voice, re&s;umed her nar|rative.</P>
<P>"I was &s;aying, ma'am&s;elle, that I well
remember when fir&s;t I heard that mu&s;ic.
It was one night, &s;oon after my lady's death,
that I had &s;at up later than u&s;ual, and I
don't know how it was, but I had been
thinking a great deal about my poor mi&s;|tre&s;s,
and of the &s;ad &s;cene I had lately wit|ne&s;&s;ed.
The chateau was quite &s;till, and
I was in a chamber at a good di&s;tance from
the re&s;t-of the &s;ervants, and this, with the
mournful things I had been thinking of,
I &s;uppo&s;e, made me low &s;pirited, for I felt
very lonely and forlorn, as it were, and li&s;t|ened
often, wishing to hear a &s;ound in the
chateau, for you know, ma'am&s;elle, when
one can hear people moving, one does not
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;o much mind, about, one's fears. But all
the &s;ervants were gone to bed, and I &s;at,
thinking and thinking, till I was almo&s;t
afraid to look round the room, and my
poor lady's countenance often came to my
mind, &s;uch as I had &s;een her when &s;he was
dying, and, once or twice, I almo&s;t thought
I &s;aw her before me,&mdash;when &s;uddenly I
heard &s;uch &s;weet mo&s;ic! It &s;eemed ju&s;t at
my window, and I &s;hall never forget what
I felt. I had not power to move from my
chair, but then, when I thought it was my
dear lady's voice, the tears came to my
eyes. I had often heard her &s;ing, in her
life-time, and to be &s;ure &s;he had a very fine
voice; it had made me cry to hear her,
many a time, when &s;he has &s;at in her oriel,
of an evening, playing upon her lute &s;uch
&s;ad &s;ongs, and &s;inging &s;o. O! it went to
one's heart! I. have li&s;tened in the anti|chamber,
for the hour together, and &s;he
would &s;ometimes &s;it playing, with the win|dow
open, when it was &s;ummer time, till
it was quite dark, and when I have gone
<PB N="41" REF="43">
in, to &s;hut it, &s;he has hardly &s;eemed to know
what hour it was. But, as I &s;aid, madam,
continued Doroth&eacute;e, "when fir&s;t I heard
the mu&s;ic, that came ju&s;t now, I thought
it was my late lady's, and I have often
thought &s;o again, when I have heard it, as
I have done at intervals, ever &s;ince. Some|times,
many months have gone by, but
&s;till it has returned."</P>
<P>"It is extraordinary," ob&s;erved Emily,
"that no per&s;on has yet di&s;covered the mu|&s;ician."</P>
<P>"Aye, ma'am&s;elle, if it had been any
thing earthly it would have been di&s;cover|ed
long ago, but who could have courage
to follow a &s;pirit, and if they had, what
good could it do?&mdash;for &s;pirits, <HI>you know,</HI>
ma'am, can take any &s;hape, or no &s;hape,
and they will be here, one minute, and, the
next perhaps, in a quite different place!"</P>
<P>"Pray re&s;ume your &s;tory of the Mar|chione&s;s,"
&s;aid Emily, "and acquaint me
with the manner of her death."</P>
<P>"I will, ma'am," &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, "but
&s;hall we leave the window?"</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44">
"This cool air refre&s;hes me," replied
Emily, "and I love to hear it creep along
the woods, and to look upon this du&s;ky
land&s;cape. You was &s;peaking of my lord,
the Marquis, when the mu&s;ic interrupted
us."</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, my lord, the Marquis, be|came
more and more gloomy; and my lady
grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till, one night, &s;he was
taken very ill, indeed. I was called up, and,
when I came to her bed-&s;ide, I was &s;hocked
to &s;ee her countenance&mdash;it was &s;o changed!
She looked piteou&s;ly up at me, and de|&s;ired
I would call the Marquis again, for
he was not yet come, and tell him &s;he had
&s;omething particular to &s;ay to him. At la&s;t,
he came, and he did, to be &s;ure, &s;eem very
&s;orry to &s;ee her, but he &s;aid very little. My
lady told him &s;he felt her&s;elf to be dying,
and wi&s;hed to &s;peak with him alone, and
then I left the room, but I &s;hall never for|get
his look as I went."</P>
<P>"When I returned, I ventured to remind
my lord about &s;ending for a doctor, for I
fuppo&s;ed he had forgot to do &s;o, in his
<PB N="43" REF="45">
grief; but my lady &s;aid it was then too
late; but my lord, &s;o far from thinking &s;o,
&s;eemed to think lightly of her di&s;order&mdash;till
&s;he was &s;eized with &s;uch terrible pains!
O, I never &s;hall forget her &s;hriek! My lord
then &s;ent off a man and hor&s;e for the doc|tor,
and walked about the room and all
over the chateau, in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s;
and I &s;taid by my dear lady, and did what
I could to ea&s;e her &s;ufferings. She had in|tervals
of ea&s;e, and in one of the&s;e &s;he &s;ent
for my lord again; when he came, I was
going, but &s;he de&s;ired I would not leave
her. O! I &s;hall never forget what a &s;cene
pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;I can hardly bear to think of it
now! My lord was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, for
my lady behaved with &s;o much goodne&s;s,
and took &s;uch pains to comfort him, that,
if he ever had &s;uffered a &s;u&s;picion to enter his
head, he mu&s;t now have been convinced he
was wrong. And to be &s;ure he did &s;eem
to be overwhelmed with the thought of his
treatment of her, and this affected her &s;o
much, that &s;he fainted away.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">
"We then got my lord out of the room;
he went into his library, and threw him&s;elf
on the floor, and there he &s;taid, and would
hear no rea&s;on, that was talked to him.
When my lady recovered, &s;he enquired for
him, but, afterwards, &s;aid &s;he could not bear
to &s;ee his grief, and de&s;ired we would let her
die quietly. She died in my arms, ma'am|&s;elle,
and &s;he went off as peacefully as a
child, for all the violence of her di&s;order
was pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e pau&s;ed, and wept, and Emily
wept with her; for &s;he was much affected
by the goodne&s;s of the late Marchione&s;s,
and by the meek patience, with which &s;he
had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>"When the doctor came," re&s;umed Do|roth&eacute;e,
"alas! he came too late; he ap|peared
greatly &s;hocked to &s;ee her, for &s;oon
after her death a frightful blackne&s;s &s;pread
all over her face. When he had &s;ent the
attendants out of the room, he a&s;ked me &s;e|veral
odd que&s;tions about the Marchione&s;s,
particularly concerning the manner, in
which &s;he had been &s;eized, and he often
<PB N="45" REF="47">
&s;hook his head at my an&s;wers, and &s;eemed
to mean more, than he cho&s;e to &s;ay. But
I under&s;tood him too well. However, I
kept my remarks to my&s;elf, and only told
them to my hu&s;band, who bade me hold
my tongue. Some of the other &s;ervants,
however, &s;u&s;pected what I did, and &s;trange
reports were whi&s;pered about the neigh|bourhood,
but nobody dared to make any
&s;tir about them. When my lord heard that
my lady was dead, he &s;hut him&s;elf up, and
would &s;ee nobody but the doctor, who
u&s;ed to be with him alone, &s;ometimes for an
hour together; and, after that, the doctor
never talked with me again about my lady.
When &s;he was buried in the church of the
convent, at a little di&s;tance yonder, if the
moon was up you might &s;ee the towers
here, ma'am&s;elle, all my lord's va&s;&s;als fol|lowed
the funeral, and there was not a dry
eye among them, for &s;he had done a deal
of good among the poor. My lord, the
Marquis, I never &s;aw any body &s;o melan|choly
as he was a&s;terwards, and &s;ometimes
<PB N="46" REF="48">
he would be in &s;uch fits of violence, that
we almo&s;t thought he had loft his &s;en&s;es.
He did not &s;tay long at the chateau, but
joined his regiment, and, &s;oon after, all the
&s;ervants, except my hu&s;band and I, received
notice to go, for my lord went to the wars.
I never &s;aw him after, for he would not re|turn
to the chateau, though it is &s;uch a fine
place, and never fini&s;hed tho&s;e fine rooms
he was building on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, and
it has, in a manner, been &s;hut up ever &s;ince,
till my lord the Count came here."</P>
<P>"The death of the Marchione&s;s appears
extraordinary," &s;aid Emily, who was anx|ious
to know more than &s;he dared to a&s;k.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," replied Doroth&eacute;e, "it
was extraordinary; I have told you all I
&s;aw, and you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s what I think.
I cannot &s;ay more, becau&s;e I would not
&s;pread reports, that might offend my lord
the Count."</P>
<P>"You are very right," &s;aid Emily;&mdash;"where
did the Marquis die?"&mdash;" In the
north of France, I believe, ma'am&s;elle," re|plied
<PB N="47" REF="49">
Doroth&eacute;e. "I was very glad, when I
heard my lord the Count was coming, for
this had been a &s;ad de&s;olate place, the&s;e
many years, and we heard &s;uch &s;trange
noi&s;es, &s;ometimes, after my lady's death,
that, as I told you before, my hu&s;band and
I left it for a neighbouring cottage. And
now, lady, I have told you all this &s;ad hi&s;|tory,
and all my thoughts, and you have
promi&s;ed, you know, never to give the lea&s;t
hint about it."&mdash;"I have," &s;aid Emily,
"and I will be faithful to my promi&s;e,
Doroth&eacute;e;&mdash;what you have told has inter|e&s;ted
me more than you can imagine. I
only wi&s;h I could prevail upon you to tell
the name of the chevalier, whom you
thought &s;o de&s;erving of the Marchione&s;s."</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e, however, &s;teadily refu&s;ed to
do this, and then returned to the notice of
Emily's likene&s;s to the late Marchione&s;s.
"There is another picture of her," added
&s;he," hanging in a room of the &s;uite, which
was &s;hut up. It was drawn, as I have
heard, before &s;he was married, and is much
<PB N="48" REF="50">
more like you than the miniature." When
Emily expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee this,
Doroth&eacute;e replied, that &s;he did not like to
open tho&s;e rooms; but Emily reminded
her, that the Count had talked the other
day of ordering them to be opened; of
which Doroth&eacute;e &s;eemed to con&s;ider much,
and then &s;he owned, that &s;he &s;hould feel
le&s;s, if &s;he went into them with Emily fir&s;t,
than otherwi&s;e, and at length promi&s;ed to
&s;hew the picture.</P>
<P>The night was too far advanced and
Emily was too much affected by the nar|rative
of the &s;cenes, which had pa&s;&s;ed in
tho&s;e apartments, to wi&s;h to vi&s;it them at
this hour, but &s;he reque&s;ted that Doroth&eacute;e
would return on the following night, when
they were not likely to be ob&s;erved, and
conduct her thither. Be&s;ides her wi&s;h to
examine the&punc; portrait, &s;he felt a thrilling
curio&s;ity to &s;ee the chamber, in which
the Marchione&s;s&punc; had died, and which Do|roth&eacute;e
had &s;aid remained, with the bed
and furniture, ju&s;t as when the corp&s;e was
<PB N="49" REF="51">
removed for interment. The &s;olemn emo|tions,
which the expectation of viewing
&s;uch a &s;cene had awakened, were in uni&s;on
with the pre&s;ent tone of her mind, depre&s;&s;ed
by &s;evere di&s;appointment. Cheerful objects
rather added to, than removed this depre&s;|&s;ion;
but, perhaps, &s;he yielded too much to
her melancholy inclination, and imprudent|ly
lamented the misfortune, which no vir|tue
of her own could have taught her to
avoid, though no effort of rea&s;on could
make her look unmoved upon the &s;elf-de|gradation
of him, whom &s;he had once e&s;|teemed
and loved.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e promi&s;ed to return, on the fol|lowing
night, with the keys of the cham|bers,
and then wi&s;hed Emily good repo&s;e,
and departed. Emily, however, continued
at the window, mu&s;ing upon the melan|choly
fate of the Marchione&s;s and li&s;tening,
in awful expectation, for a return of the
mu&s;ic. But the &s;tillne&s;s of the night re|mained
long unbroken, except by the mur|muring
&s;ounds of the woods, as they wav|ed
<PB N="50" REF="52">
in the breeze, and then by the di&s;tant
bell of the convent, linking one. She now
withdrew from the window, and, as &s;he
&s;at at her bed-&s;ide, indulging melancholy
reveries, which the loneline&s;s of the hour
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, the &s;tillne&s;s was &s;uddenly interrupt|ed
not by mu&s;ic, but by very uncommon
&s;ounds, that &s;eemed to come either from the
room, adjoining her own, or from one be|low.
The terrible cata&s;trophe, that had been
related to her, together with the my&s;terious
circum&s;tances, &s;aid to have &s;ince occurred
in the chateau, had &s;o much &s;hocked her
&s;pirits, that &s;he now &s;unk, for a moment,
under the weakne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition. The
&s;ounds, however, did not return, and &s;he
retired, to forget in &s;leep the di&s;a&s;trous &s;to|ry
&s;he had heard.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the next night, about the &s;ame hour
as before, Doroth&eacute;e came to Emily's cham|ber,
with the keys of that &s;uite of rooms,
which had been particularly appropriated
to the late Marchione&s;s. The&s;e extended
along the north &s;ide of the chateau, form|ing
part of the old building; and, as
Emily's room was in the &s;outh, they had to
pa&s;s over a great extent of the ca&s;tle, and by
the chambers of &s;everal of the family, who&s;e
ob&s;ervations Doroth&eacute;e was anxious to avoid,
&s;ince it might excite enquiry and rai&s;e re|ports,
&s;uch as would di&s;plea&s;e the Count.
She, therefore, reque&s;ted, that Emily would
wait half an hour, before they ventured
<PB N="52" REF="54">
forth, that they might be certain all the &s;er|vants
were gone to bed. It was nearly one,
before the chateau was perfectly &s;till, or
Doroth&eacute;e thought it prudent to leave the
chamber. In this interval, her &s;pirits &s;eem|ed
to be greatly affected by the remem|brance
of pa&s;t events, and by the pro&s;pect
of entering again upon places, where the&s;e
had occurred, and in which &s;he had not
been for &s;o many years. Emily too was
affected, but her feelings had more of &s;o|lemnity,
and le&s;s of fear. From the &s;i|lence,
into which reflection and expectation
had thrown them, they, at length, rou&s;ed
them&s;elves, and left the chamber. Doro|th&eacute;e,
at fir&s;t, carried the lamp, but her hand
trembled &s;o much with infirmity and alarm,
that Emily took it from her, and offered
her arm, to &s;upport her feeble &s;teps.</P>
<P>They had to de&s;cend the great &s;tair-ca&s;e,
and, after pa&s;&s;ing over a wide extent of the
chateau, to a&s;cend another, which led to the
&s;uite of rooms they were in que&s;t of. They
&s;tepped cautiou&s;ly along the open corridor,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
that ran round the great hall, and into
which the chambers of the Count, Coun|te&s;s,
and the lady Blanch, opened, and, from
thence, de&s;cending the chief &s;tair-ca&s;e, they
cro&s;&s;ed the hall it&s;elf. Proceeding through
the &s;ervants hall, where the dying embers
of a wood fire &s;till glimmered on the
hearth, and the &s;upper table was &s;urrounded
by chairs, that ob&s;tructed their pa&s;&s;age,
they came to the foot of the back &s;tair-ca&s;e.
Old Doroth&eacute;e here pau&s;ed, and looked
around; "Let us li&s;ten," &s;aid &s;he, "if any
thing is &s;tirring; Ma'am&s;elle, do you hear
any voice?" "None," &s;aid Emily, "there
certainly is no per&s;on up in the chateau,
be&s;ides our&s;elves."&mdash;"No, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid
Doroth&eacute;e "but I have never been here at
this hour before, and, after what I know, my
fears are not wonderful."&mdash;"What do
you know?" &s;aid Emily.&mdash;"O ma'am|&s;elle,
we have no time for talking now; let
us go on. That door on the left is the one
we mu&s;t open."</P>
<P>They proceeded, and, having reached the
<PB N="54" REF="56">
top of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, Doroth&eacute;e. applied the
key to the lock. "Ah," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he
endeavoured to turn it, "&s;o many years
have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince this was opened, that I fear
it will not move." Emily was more &s;ucce&s;s|ful,
and they pre&s;ently entered a &s;pacious
and ancient chamber.</P>
<P>"Alas! exclaimed Doroth&eacute;e, as &s;he en|tered,
"the la&s;t time I pa&s;&s;ed through this
door&mdash;I followed my poor lady's corp&s;e!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;truck with the circum&s;tance, and
affected by the du&s;ky and &s;olemn air of
the apartment, remained &s;ilent, and they
pa&s;&s;ed on through a long &s;uite of rooms, till
they came to one more &s;pacious than the
re&s;t, and rich in the remains of faded magni|ficence.</P>
<P>"Let us re&s;t here awhile, madam," &s;aid
Doroth&eacute;e faintly, "we are going into the
chamber, where my lady died! that door
opens into it. Ah, ma'am&s;elle! why did
you per&s;uade me to come?"</P>
<P>Emily drew one of the ma&s;&s;y arm-chairs,
with which the apartment was furni&s;hed,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
and begged Doroth&eacute;e would &s;it down, and
try to compo&s;e her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"How the &s;ight of this place brings all
that pa&s;&s;ed formerly to my mind!" &s;aid Do|roth&eacute;e;
"it &s;eems as if it was but ye&s;ter|day
&s;ince all that &s;ad affair happened!"</P>
<P>"Hark! what noi&s;e is that?" &s;aid
Emily.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e, half &s;tarting from her chair,
looked round the apartment, and they li&s;|tened&mdash;but,
every thing remaining &s;till, the
old woman &s;poke again upon the &s;ubject of
her &s;orrow. "This &s;aloon, ma'am&s;elle,
was in my lady's time the fine&s;t apartment
in the chateau, and it was fitted up accord|ing
to her own ta&s;te. All this grand furni|ture,
but you can now hardly &s;ee what it is
for the du&s;t, and our light is none of the
bed&mdash;ah! how I have &s;een this room lighted
up in my lady's time!&mdash;all this grand fur|niture
came from Paris, and was made after
the fashion of &s;ome in the Louvre there, ex|cept
tho&s;e large gla&s;&s;es, and they came from
&s;ome outlandi&s;h place, and that rich tape&s;|try.
<PB N="56" REF="58">
How the colours are faded already!&mdash;&s;ince
I &s;aw it la&s;t!"</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood, that was twenty years
ago," ob&s;erved Emily.</P>
<P>"Thereabout, madam," &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e,
"and well remembered, but all the time
between then and now &s;eems as nothing.
That tape&s;try u&s;ed to be greatly admired at,
it tells the &s;tories out of &s;ome famous book,
or other, but I have forgot the name."</P>
<P>Emily now ro&s;e to examine the figures it
exhibited, and di&s;covered, by ver&s;es in the
Proven&ccedil;al tongue, wrought underneath each
&s;cene, that it exhibited &s;tories from &s;ome of
the mo&s;t celebrated ancient romances.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e's &s;pirits being now more com|po&s;ed,
&s;he ro&s;e, and unlocked the door that
led into the late Marchione&s;s's apartment,
and Emily pa&s;&s;ed into a lofty chamber,
hung round with dark arras, and &s;o &s;pa|cious,
that the lamp &s;he held up did not &s;hew
its extent; while Doroth&eacute;e, when &s;he en|tered,
had dropped into a chair, where,
&s;ighing deeply, &s;he &s;carcely tru&s;ted her&s;elf
with the view of a &s;cene &s;o affecting to her.
<PB N="57" REF="59">
It was &s;ome time before Emily perceived,
through the du&s;k, the bed on which the
Marchione&s;s was &s;aid to have died; when,
advancing to the upper end of the room,
&s;he di&s;covered the high canopied te&s;ter of
dark green dama&s;k, with the curtains de|&s;cending
to the floor in the fa&s;hion of a
tent, half drawn, and remaining apparently,
as they had been left twenty years before&punc;
and over the whole bedding was thrown a
counterpane, or pall, of black velvet, that
hung down to the floor. Emily &s;huddered,
as &s;he held the lamp over it, and looked
within the dark curtains, where &s;he almo&s;t
expected to have &s;een a human face, and,
&s;uddenly remembering the horror &s;he had
&s;uffered upon di&s;covering the dying Ma|dame
Montoni in the turret-chamber of
Udolpho, her &s;pirits fainted, and &s;he was
turning from the bed, when Doroth&eacute;e, who
had now reached it, exclaimed, "Holy
Virgin! methinks I &s;ee my lady &s;tretched
upon that pall&mdash;as when la&s;t I &s;aw hen!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;hocked by this exclamation,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
looked involuntarily again within the cur|tains,
but the blackne&s;s of the pall only ap|peared;
while Doroth&eacute;e was compelled to
&s;upport her&s;elf upon the &s;ide of the bed,
and pre&s;ently tears brought her &s;ome relief.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, after &s;he had wept
awhile, "it was here I &s;at on that terrible
night, and held my lady's hand, and heard
her la&s;t words, and &s;aw all her &s;ufferings&mdash;<HI>here</HI>
&s;he died in my arms!"</P>
<P>"Do not indulge the&s;e painful recollec|tions,"
&s;aid Emily, "let us go. Shew me
the picture you mentioned, if it will not
too much affect you."</P>
<P>"It hangs in the oriel," &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e
ri&s;ing, and going towards a &s;mall door near
the bed's head, which &s;he opened, and
Emily followed with the light, into the
clo&s;et of the late Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>"Alas! there &s;he is, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid
Doroth&eacute;e, pointing to a portrait of a lady,
"there is her very &s;elf! ju&s;t as &s;he looked
when &s;he came fir&s;t to the chateau. You
<PB N="59" REF="61">
&s;ee, madam, &s;he was all blooming like you,
then&mdash;and &s;o &s;oon to be cut off!"</P>
<P>While Doroth&eacute;e &s;poke, Emily was at|tentively
examining the picture, which
bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the miniature,
though the expre&s;&s;ion of the countenance
in each was &s;omewhat different; but &s;till
&s;he thought &s;he perceived &s;omething of
that pen&s;ive melancholy in the portrait,
which &s;o &s;trongly characteri&s;ed the minia|ture.</P>
<P>"Pray, ma'am&s;elle, &s;tand be&s;ide the pic|ture,
that I may look at you together,"
&s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, who, when the reque&s;t was
complied with, exclaimed again at the re&s;em|blance.
Emily al&s;o, as &s;he gazed upon it,
thought that &s;he had &s;omewhere &s;een a per|&s;on
very like it, though &s;he could not now
recollect who this was.</P>
<P>In this clo&s;et were many memorials of
the departed Marchione&s;s; a robe and &s;e|veral
articles of her dre&s;s were &s;cattered
upon the chairs, as if they had ju&s;t been
thrown off. On the floor, were a pair of
<PB N="60" REF="62">
black &s;attin &s;lippers, and, on the dre&s;&s;ing|table,
a pair of gloves and a long black
veil, which, as Emily took it up to exa|mine,
&s;he perceived was dropping to pieces
with age.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, ob&s;erving the
veil, "my lady's hand laid it there; it has
never been moved &s;ince!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;huddering, immediately laid it
down again. "I well remember &s;eeing
her take it off," continued Doroth&eacute;e, "it
was on the night before her death, when &s;he
had returned from a little walk I had per|&s;uaded
her to take in the gardens, and &s;he
&s;eemed, refre&s;hed by it. I told her how
much better &s;he looked, and I remember
what a languid &s;mile &s;he gave me; but,
alas! &s;he little thought, or I either, that
&s;he was to die, that night."</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e wept again, and then, taking
up the veil, threw it &s;uddenly over Emily&punc;
who &s;huddered to find it wrapped round
her, de&s;cending even to her feet, and, as &s;he
endeavoured to throw it off, Doroth&eacute;e in|treated
<PB N="61" REF="63">
that &s;he would keep it on for one
moment. "I thought," added &s;he, "how
like you would look to my dear mi&s;tre&s;s in
that veil;&mdash;may your life, ma'am&s;elle, be
a happier one than hers!"</P>
<P>Emily, having di&s;engaged her&s;elf from
the veil, laid it again on the dre&s;&s;ing-table,
and &s;urveyed the clo&s;et, where every object,
on which her eye fixed, &s;eemed to &s;peak of
the Marchione&s;s. In a large oriel window
of painted gla&s;s, &s;tood a table, with a &s;ilver
crucifix, and a prayer-book open; and
Emily remembered with emotion what Do|roth&eacute;e
had mentioned concerning her cu&s;|torn
of playing on her lute in this window,
before &s;he ob&s;erved the lute it&s;elf, lying on
a corner of the table, as if it had been care|le&s;sly
placed there by the hand, that had &s;o
often awakened it.</P>
<P>"This is a &s;ad forlorn place!" &s;aid Do|roth&eacute;e,
"for, when my dear lady died, I had
no heart to put it to rights, or the chamber
either; and my lord never came into the
rooms after, &s;o they remain ju&s;t as they
<PB N="62" REF="64">
did when my lady was removed for inter|ment."</P>
<P>While Doroth&eacute;e &s;poke, Emily was &s;till
looking on the lute, which was a Spani&s;h
one, and remarkably large; and then, with
a he&s;itating hand, &s;he took it up, and pa&s;&s;ed
her fingers over the chords. They were
out of tune, but uttered a deep and full
&s;ound. Doroth&eacute;e &s;tarted at their well|known
tones, and, &s;eeing the lute in Emily's
hand, &s;aid, "This is the lute my lady
Marchione&s;s loved &s;o! I remember when
la&s;t she played upon it&mdash;it was on the night
that &s;he died. I came as u&s;ual to undre&s;s
her, and, as I entered the bed-chamber, I
heard the &s;ound of mu&s;ic from the oriel,
and perceiving it was my lady's, who was
&s;itting there, I &s;tepped &s;oftly to the door,
which &s;tood a little open, to li&s;ten; for the
mu&s;ic&mdash;though it was mournful&mdash;was &s;o
&s;weet! There I &s;aw her, with the lute in
her hand, looking upwards, and the tears
fell upon her cheeks, while &s;he &s;ung a ve&s;per
hymn, &s;o &s;oft, and &s;o &s;olemn! and her voice
<PB N="63" REF="65">
trembled, as it were, and then &s;he would
&s;top for a moment, and wipe away her
tears, and go on again, lower than before.
O! I had often li&s;tened to my lady, but ne|ver
heard any thing &s;o &s;weet as this; it
made me cry, almo&s;t, to hear it. She had
been at prayers, I fancy, for there was the
book open on the table be&s;ide her&mdash;aye,
and there it lies open &s;till! Pray, let us
leave the oriel, ma'am&s;elle," added Do|roth&eacute;e,
"this is a heart-breaking place!"</P>
<P>Having returned into the chamber, &s;he
de&s;ired to look once more upon the bed,
when, as they came oppo&s;ite to the open
door, leading into the &s;aloon, Emily, in the
partial gleam, which the lamp threw into
it, thought &s;he &s;aw &s;omething glide along
into the ob&s;curer part of the room. Her
&s;pirits had been much affected by the &s;ur|rounding
&s;cene, or it is probable this cir|cum&s;tance,
whether real or imaginary, would
not have affected her in the degree it did;
but &s;he endeavoured to conceal her emo|tion
from Doroth&eacute;e, who, however, ob&s;erv|ing
<PB N="64" REF="66">
her countenance change, enquired if &s;he
was ill.</P>
<P>"Let us go," &s;aid Emily, faintly, "the
air of the&s;e rooms is unwhole&s;ome&punc;" but,
when &s;he attempted to do &s;o, con&s;idering
that &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s through the apartment
where the phantom of her terror had ap|peared,
this terror increa&s;ed, and, too faint
to &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;he &s;at down on the &s;ide
of the bed.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e, believing that &s;he was only af|fected
by a con&s;ideration of the melancholy
cata&s;trophe, which had happened on this
&s;pot, endeavoured to cheer her; and then,
as they &s;at together on the bed, &s;he began
to relate other particulars concerning it,
and this without reflecting, that it might
increa&s;e Emily's emotion, but becau&s;e they
were particularly intere&s;ting to her&s;elf. "A
little before my lady's death," &s;aid &s;he,
"when the pains were gone off, &s;he called
me to her, and, &s;tretching out her hand to
me, I &s;at down ju&s;t there&mdash;where the cur|tain
falls upon the bed. How well I re|member
<PB N="65" REF="67">
her look at the time&mdash;death was in
it!&mdash;I can almo&s;t fancy I &s;ee her now.&mdash;There
&s;he lay, ma'am&s;elle&mdash;her face was
upon the pillow there! This black coun|terpane
was not upon the bed then; it was
laid on, after her death, and &s;he was laid
out upon it."</P>
<P>Emily turned to look within the du&s;ky
curtains, as if &s;he could have &s;een the coun|tenance
of which Doroth&eacute;e &s;poke. The
edge of the white pillow only appeared
above the blackne&s;s of the pall, but, as her
eyes wandered over the pall it&s;elf, &s;he fan|cied
&s;he &s;aw it move. Without &s;peaking,
&s;he caught Doroth&eacute;e's arm, who, &s;urpri&s;ed
by the action, and by the look of terror that
accompanied it, turned her eyes from Emily
to the bed, where, in the next moment &s;he,
too, &s;aw the pall &s;lowly lifted, and fall
again.</P>
<P>Emily attempted to go, but Doroth&eacute;e
&s;tood fixed and gazing upon the bed; and,
at length, &s;aid&mdash;"It is only the wind, that
waves it, ma'am&s;elle; we have left all the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
doors open: &s;ee how the air waves the
lamp, too.&mdash;It is only the wind."</P>
<P>She had &s;carcely uttered the&s;e words,
when the pall was more violently agitated
than before; but Emily, &s;omewhat a&s;hamed
of her terrors, &s;tepped back to the bed,
willing to be convinced that the wind only
had occa&s;ioned her alarm; when, as &s;he
gazed within the curtains, the pall moved
again, and, in the next moment, the appa|rition
of a human countenance ro&s;e above
it.</P>
<P>Screaming with terror, they both fled,
and got out of the chamber as fa&s;t as their
trembling limbs would bear them, leaving
open the doors of all the rooms, through
which they pa&s;&s;ed. When they reached
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, Doroth&eacute;e threw open a cham|ber-door,
where &s;ome of the female &s;ervants
&s;lept, and &s;unk breathle&s;s on the bed;
while Emily, deprived of all pre&s;ence of
mind, made only a feeble attempt to con|ceal
the occa&s;ion of her terror from the
a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ervants; and, though Doroth&eacute;e,
<PB N="67" REF="69">
when &s;he could &s;peak, endeavoured to laugh
at her own fright, and was joined by Emily,
no remon&s;trances could prevail with the
&s;ervants, who had quickly taken the alarm,
to pa&s;s even the remainder of the night in a
room &s;o near to the&s;e terrific chambers.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e having accompanied Emily to
her own apartment, they then began to talk
over, with &s;ome degree of coolne&s;s, the
&s;trange circum&s;tance, that had ju&s;t occurred;
and Emily would almo&s;t have doubted her
own perceptions, had not tho&s;e of Doro|th&eacute;e
atte&s;ted their truth. Having now men|tioned
what &s;he had ob&s;erved in the outer
chamber, &s;he a&s;ked the hou&s;ekeeper, whe|ther
&s;he was certain no door had been left
unfa&s;tened, by which a per&s;on might &s;e|cretly
have entered the apartments? Doro|th&eacute;e
replied, that &s;he had con&s;tantly kept
the keys of the &s;everal doors in her own
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that, when &s;he had gone her
rounds through the ca&s;tle, as &s;he frequently
did, to examine if all was &s;afe, &s;he had
tried the&s;e doors among the re&s;t, and had
<PB N="68" REF="70">
always found them fa&s;tened. It was, there|fore,
impo&s;&s;ible, &s;he added, that any per&s;on
could have got admittance into the apart|ments;
and, if they could&mdash;it was very im|probable
they &s;hould have cho&s;e to &s;leep in
a place &s;o cold and forlorn.</P>
<P>Emily ob&s;erved, that their vi&s;it to the&s;e
chambers had, perhaps, been watched, and
that &s;ome per&s;on, for a frolic, had followed
them into the rooms, with a de&s;ign to
frighten them, and, while they were in the
oriel, had taken the opportunity of conceal|ing
him&s;elf in the bed.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e allowed, that this was po&s;&s;ible,
till &s;he recollected, that, on entering the
apartments, &s;he had turned the key of the
outer door, and this, which had been done
to prevent their vi&s;it being noticed by any
of the family, who might happen to be up,
mu&s;t effectually have excluded every per|&s;on,
except them&s;elves, from the chambers;
and &s;he now per&s;i&s;ted in affirming, that the
gha&s;tly countenance &s;he had &s;een was no|thing
<PB N="69" REF="71">
human, but &s;ome dreadful appa|rition.</P>
<P>Emily was very &s;olemnly affected. Of
whatever nature might be the appearance
&s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, whether human or &s;uper|natural,
the fate of the decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s
was a truth not to be doubted; and this un|accountable
circum&s;tance, occurring in the
very &s;cene of her &s;ufferings, affected Emily's
imagination with a &s;uper&s;titious awe, to
which, after having detected the fallacies at
Udolpho, &s;he might not have yielded, had
&s;he been ignorant of the unhappy &s;tory, re|lated
by the hou&s;ekeeper. Her &s;he now &s;o|lemnly
conjured to conceal the occurrence
of this night, and to make light of the ter|ror
&s;he had already betrayed, that the Count
might not be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by reports, which
would certainly &s;pread alarm and confu&s;ion
among his family. "Time," &s;he added,
"may explain this my&s;terious affair; mean|while
let us watch the event in &s;ilence."</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e readily acquie&s;ced; but &s;he
now recollected that &s;he had left all the
<PB N="70" REF="72">
doors of the north &s;uite of rooms open, and,
not having courage to return alone to lock
even the outer one, Emily, after &s;ome ef|fort,
&s;o far conquered her own fears, that
&s;he offered to accompany her to the foot of
the back &s;tair-ca&s;e, and to wait there while
Doroth&eacute;e a&s;cended, who&s;e re&s;olution being
re-a&s;&s;ured by this circum&s;tance, &s;he con|&s;ented
to go, and they left Emily's apart|ment
together.</P>
<P>No &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;tillne&s;s, as they
pa&s;&s;ed along the halls and galleries; but,
on reaching the foot of the back &s;tair-ca&s;e,
Doroth&eacute;e's re&s;olution failed again; having,
however, pau&s;ed a moment to li&s;ten, and no
&s;ound being heard above, &s;he a&s;cended,
leaving Emily below, and, &s;carcely &s;uffer|ing
her eye to glance within the fir&s;t cham|ber,
&s;he fa&s;tened the door, which &s;hut up
the whole &s;uite of apartments, and returned
to Emily.</P>
<P>As they &s;tepped along the pa&s;&s;age, lead|ing
into the great hall, a &s;ound of lamenta|tion
was heard, which &s;eemed to come from
<PB N="71" REF="73">
the hall it&s;elf, and they &s;topped in new
alarm to li&s;ten, when Emily pre&s;ently di&s;|tingui&s;hed
the voice of Annette, whom &s;he
found cro&s;&s;ing the hall, with another female
&s;ervant, and &s;o terrified by the report, which
the other maids had &s;pread, that, believing
&s;he could be &s;afe only where her lady was,
&s;he was going for refuge to her apartment.
Emily's endeavours to laugh, or to argue
her out of the&s;e terrors, were equally vain,
and, in compa&s;&s;ion to her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he con|&s;ented
that &s;he &s;hould remain in her room
during the night.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Hail, mildly-plea&s;ing Solitude!</L>

<L>Thine is the balmy breath of morn,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as the dew-bent ro&s;e is born.</L>

<L>And the faint land&s;cape &s;wims away,</L>

<BIBL>THOMPSON.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY's injunctions to Annette to be &s;ilent
on the &s;ubject of her terror were ineffectual,
and the occurrence of the preceding night
&s;pread &s;uch alarm among the &s;ervants, who
now all affirmed, that they had frequently
heard unaccountable noi&s;es in the chateau,
that a report &s;oon reached the Count of the
north &s;ide of the ca&s;tle being haunted. He
treated this, at fir&s;t, with ridicule, but, per|ceiving,
that it was productive of &s;erious
evil, in the confu&s;ion it occa&s;ioned among
his household, he forbade any per&s;on to re|peat
it, on pain of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">
The arrival of a party of his friends &s;oon
withdrew his thoughts entirely from this
&s;ubject, and his &s;ervants had now little lei|&s;ure
to brood over it, except, indeed, in the
evenings after &s;upper, when they all a&s;&s;embled
in their hall, and related &s;tories of gho&s;ts,
till they feared to took round the room;
&s;tarted, if the echo of a clo&s;ing door mur|mured
along the pa&s;&s;age, and refu&s;ed to go
&s;ingly to any part of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On the&s;e occa&s;ions Annette made a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
figure. When &s;he told not only of
all the wonders &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, but of all
that &s;he had imagined, in the ca&s;tle of Udol|pho,
with the &s;tory of the &s;trange di&s;appear|ance
of Signora Laurentini, &s;he made no tri|fling
impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of her attentive
auditors. Her &s;u&s;picions, concerning Mon|toni,
&s;he would al&s;o have freely di&s;clo&s;ed,
had not Ludovico, who was now in the &s;er|vice
of the Count, prudently checked her
loquacity, whenever it pointed to that &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Among the vi&s;itors at the chateau was
<PB N="74" REF="76">
the Baron de Saint Foix, an old friend of
the Count, and his &s;on, the Chevalier St.
Foix, a &s;en&s;ible and amiable young man,
who, having in the preceding year &s;een the
Lady Blanche, at Paris, had become her de|clared
admirer. The friend&s;hip, which the
Count had long entertained for his father,
and the equality of their circum&s;tances made
him &s;ecretly approve of the connection; but,
thinking his daughter at this time too young
to fix her choice for life, and wi&s;hing to prove
the &s;incerity and &s;trength of the Chevalier's
attachment, he then rejected his &s;uit, though
without forbidding his future hope. This
young man now came, with the Baron, his
father, to claim the reward of a &s;teady affec|tion,
a claim, which the Count admitted and
which Blanche did not reject.</P>
<P>While the&s;e vi&s;itors were at the chateau, it
became a &s;cene of gaiety and &s;plendour. The
pavilion in the woods was fitted up and fre|quented,
in the fine evenings, as a &s;upper|room,
when the hour u&s;ually concluded with
a concert, at which the Count and Counte&s;s,
<PB N="75" REF="77">
who were &s;cientific performers, and the Che|valiers
Henri and St. Foix, with the Lady
Blanche and Emily, who&s;e voices and fine
ta&s;te compen&s;ated for the want of more &s;kil|ful
execution, u&s;ually a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Several of the
Count's &s;ervants performed on horns and
other in&s;truments, &s;ome of which, placed at
a little di&s;tance among the woods, &s;poke, in
&s;weet re&s;pon&s;e, to the harmony, that pro|ceeded
from the pavilion.</P>
<P>At any other period, the&s;e parties would
have been delightful to Emily; but her &s;pi|rits
were now oppre&s;&s;ed with a melancholy,
which &s;he perceived that no kind of what is
called amu&s;ement had power to di&s;&s;ipate,
and which the tender and, frequently, pa|thetic,
melody of the&s;e concerts &s;ometimes
increa&s;ed to a very painful degree.</P>
<P>She was particularly fond of walking in
the woods, that hung on a promontory,
overlooking the &s;ea. Their luxuriant &s;hade
was &s;oothing to her pen&s;ive mind, and, in
the partial views, which they afforded of the
Mediterranean, with its winding &s;hores and
<PB N="76" REF="78">
pa&s;&s;ing &s;ails, tranquil beauty was united
with grandeur. The paths were rude and
frequently overgrown with vegetation, but
their ta&s;teful owner would &s;uffer little to be
done to them, and &s;carcely a &s;ingle branch
to be lopped from the venerable trees. On
an eminence, in one of the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered
parts of the&s;e woods, was a ru&s;tic &s;eat,
formed of the trunk of a decayed oak, which
had once been a noble tree, and of which
many lofty branches &s;till flouri&s;hing united
with beech and pines to over-canopy the
&s;pot. Beneath their deep umbrage, the eye
pa&s;&s;ed over the tops of other woods, to the
Mediterranean, and, to the left, through an
opening, was &s;een a ruined watch-tower,
&s;tanding on a point of rock, near the &s;ea,
and ri&s;ing from among the tufted foliage.</P>
<P>Hither Emily often came alone in the
&s;ilence of evening, and, &s;oothed by the
&s;cenery and by the faint murmur, that ro&s;e
from the waves, would &s;it, till darkne&s;s
obliged her to return to the chateau. Fre|quently,
al&s;o, &s;he vi&s;ited the watch-tower,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
which commanded the entire pro&s;pect, and,
when &s;he leaned again&s;t its broken walls,
and thought of Valancourt, &s;he not once
imagined, what was &s;o true, that this tower
had been almo&s;t as frequently his re&s;ort, as
her own, &s;ince his e&s;trangement from the
neighbouring chateau.</P>
<P>One evening, &s;he lingered here to a late
hour. She had &s;at on the &s;teps of the build|ing,
watching, in tranquil melancholy, the
gradual effect of evening over the exten|&s;ive
pro&s;pect, till the gray waters of the
Mediterranean and the ma&s;&s;y woods were
almo&s;t the only features of the &s;cene, that re|mained
vi&s;ible; when, as &s;he gazed alter|nately
on the&s;e, and on the mild blue of the
heavens, where the fir&s;t pale &s;tar of evening
appeared, &s;he per&s;onified the hour in the
following lines:&mdash;</P>

<P>The moon was now ri&s;ing out of the
&s;ea. She watched its gradual progre&s;s, the
extending line of radiance it threw upon
the waters, the &s;parkling oars, the &s;ail faint|ly
&s;ilvered, and the wood-tops and the bat|tlements
of the watch-tower, at who&s;e foot
&s;he was &s;itting, ju&s;t tinted with the rays.
Emily's &s;pirits were in harmony with this
&s;cene. As &s;he &s;at meditating, &s;ounds &s;tole
by her on the air, which &s;he immediately
knew to be the mu&s;ic and the voice &s;he
had formerly heard at midnight, and the
<PB N="80" REF="82">
emotion of awe, which &s;he felt, was not
unmixed with terror, when &s;he con&s;idered
her remote and lonely &s;ituation. The
&s;ounds drew nearer. She would have ri&s;en
to leave the place, but they &s;eemed to come
from the way &s;he mu&s;t have taken towards
the chateau, and &s;he awaited the event in
trembling expectation. The &s;ounds con|tinued
to approach, for &s;ome time, and
then cea&s;ed. Emily &s;at li&s;tening, gazing
and unable to move, when &s;he &s;aw a figure
emerge from the &s;hade of the woods and
pa&s;s along the bank, at &s;ome little di&s;tance
before her. It went &s;wiftly, and her &s;pirits
were &s;o overcome with awe, that, though
&s;he &s;aw, &s;he did not much ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Having left the &s;pot, with a re&s;olution
never again to vi&s;it it alone, at &s;o late an
hour, &s;he began to approach the chateau,
when &s;he heard voices calling her from the
part of the wood, which was neare&s;t to it.
They were the &s;houts of the Count's &s;er|vants,
who were &s;ent to &s;earch for her; and
when &s;he entered the &s;upper-room, where
<PB N="81" REF="83">
he &s;at with Henri and Blanche, he gently
reproached her with a look, which &s;he
blu&s;hed to have de&s;erved.</P>
<P>This little occurrence deeply impre&s;&s;ed
her mind, and, when &s;he withdrew to her
own room, it recalled &s;o forcibly the cir|cum&s;tances
&s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, a few nights
before, that &s;he had &s;carcely courage to re|main
alone. She watched to a late hour,
when, no &s;ound having renewed her fears,
&s;he, at length, &s;unk to repo&s;e. But this
was of &s;hort continuance, for &s;he was dis|turbed
by a loud and unu&s;ual noi&s;e, that
&s;eemed to come from the gallery, into
which her chamber opened. Groans were
di&s;tinctly heard, and, immediately after, a
dead weight fell again&s;t her door, with a
violence, that threatened to bur&s;t it open.
She called loudly to know who was there,
but received no an&s;wer, though, at inter|vals,
&s;he &s;till thought &s;he heard &s;omething
like a low moaning. Fear deprived her of
the power to move. Soon after, &s;he heard
<PB N="82" REF="84">
foot&s;teps in a remote part of the gallery,
and, as they approached, &s;he called more
loudly than before, till the &s;teps pau&s;ed at
her door. She then di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices
of &s;everal of the &s;ervants, who &s;eemed too
much engaged by &s;ome circum&s;tance with|out,
to attend to her calls; but, Annette
&s;oon after entering the room for water,
Emily under&s;tood, that one of the maids
had fainted, whom she immediately de&s;ired
them to bring into her room, where &s;he a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
to re&s;tore her. When this girl had
recovered her &s;peech, &s;he affirmed, that, as
&s;he was pa&s;&s;ing up the back &s;tair-ca&s;e, in
the way to her chamber, &s;he had &s;een an
apparition on the &s;econd landing-place;
&s;he held the lamp low, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he
might pick her way, &s;everal of the &s;tairs
being infirm and even decayed, and it was
upon rai&s;ing her eyes, that &s;he &s;aw this ap|pearance.
It &s;tood for a moment in the
corner of the landing-place, which &s;he was
approaching, and then, gliding up the
<PB N="83" REF="85">
&s;tairs, vani&s;hed at the door of the apart|ment,
that had been lately opened. She
heard afterwards a hollow &s;ound.</P>
<P>"Then the devil has got a key to that
apartment," &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, "for it could
be nobody but he; I locked the door my|&s;elf!"</P>
<P>The girl, &s;pringing down the &s;tairs and
pa&s;&s;ing up the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, had run,
with a faint &s;cream, till &s;he reached the gal|lery,
where &s;he fell, groaning, at Emily's
door.</P>
<P>Gently chiding her for the alarm &s;he had
occa&s;ioned, Emily tried to make her a&s;ham|ed
of her fears; but the girl per&s;i&s;ted in &s;ay|ing,
that &s;he had &s;een an apparition, till &s;he
went to her own room, whither &s;he was ac|companied
by all the &s;ervants pre&s;ent, ex|cept
Doroth&eacute;e, who, at Emily's reque&s;t, re|mained
with her during the night. Emily
was perplexed, and Doroth&eacute;e was terrified,
and mentioned many occurrences of former
times, which had long &s;ince confirmed her
&s;uper&s;titions; among the&s;e, according to
<PB N="84" REF="86">
her belief, &s;he had once witne&s;&s;ed an appear|ance,
like that ju&s;t de&s;cribed, and on the very
&s;ame &s;pot, and it was the remembrance of it,
that had made her pau&s;e, when &s;he was go|ing
to a&s;cend the &s;tairs with Emily, and
which had increa&s;ed her reluctance to open
the north apartments. Whatever might be
Emily's opinions, &s;he did not di&s;clo&s;e them,
but li&s;tened attentively to all that Doroth&eacute;e
communicated, which occa&s;ioned her much
thought and perplexity.</P>
<P>From this night the terror of the &s;er|vants
increa&s;ed to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that &s;e|veral
of them determined to leave the cha|teau,
and reque&s;ted their di&s;charge of the
Count, who, if he had any faith in the &s;ub|ject
of their alarm, thought proper to di&s;|&s;emble
it, and, anxious to avoid the incon|venience
that threatened him, employed ri|dicule
and then argument to convince them
they had nothing to apprehend from &s;uper|natural
agency. But fear had rendered
their minds inacce&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on; and it
was now, that Ludovico proved at once
<PB N="85" REF="87">
his courage and his gratitude for the kind|ne&s;s
he had received from the Count, by
offering to watch, during a night, in the
&s;uite of rooms, reputed to be haunted.
He feared, he &s;aid, no &s;pirits, and, if any
thing of human form appeared&mdash;he would
prove that he dreaded that as little.</P>
<P>The Count pau&s;ed upon the offer, while
the &s;ervants, who heard it, looked upon one
another in doubt and amazement, and An|nette,
terrified for the &s;afety of Ludovico,
employed tears and entreaties to di&s;&s;uade
him from his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"You are a bold fellow," &s;aid the
Count, &s;miling, "Think well of what you
are going to encounter, before you finally
determine upon it. However, if you per|&s;evere
in your re&s;olution, I will accept your
offer, and your intrepidity &s;hall not go un|rewarded."</P>
<P>"I de&s;ire no reward, your <HI>Excellenza,</HI>"
replied Ludovico, "but your approbation.
Your <HI>Excellenza</HI> has been &s;ufficiently good
to me already; but I wi&s;h to have arms,
<PB N="86" REF="88">
that I may be equal to my enemy, if he
&s;hould appear."</P>
<P>"Your &s;word cannot defend you again&s;t
a gho&s;t," replied the Count, throwing a
glance of irony upon the other &s;ervants,
"neither can bars, or bolts; for a &s;pirit,
you know, can glide through a key-hole, as
ea&s;ily as through a door."</P>
<P>"Give me a &s;word, my lord Count,"
&s;aid Ludovico, "and I will lay all the
&s;pirits, that &s;hall attack me, in the red
&s;ea."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid the Count, "you &s;hall
have a &s;word, and good cheer, too; and
your brave comrades here will, perhaps,
have courage enough to remain another
night in the chateau, &s;ince your boldne&s;s
will certainly, for this night, at lea&s;t, con|fine
all the malice of the &s;pectre to your|&s;elf."</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity now &s;truggled with fear in the
minds of &s;everal of his fellow &s;ervants, and,
at length, they re&s;olved to await the event
of Ludovico's ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89">
Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed and concerned, when
&s;he heard of his intention, and was frequent|ly
inclined to mention what &s;he had wit|ne&s;&s;ed
in the north apartments to the Count,
for &s;he could not entirely dive&s;t her&s;elf of
fears for Ludovico's &s;afety, though her
rea&s;on repre&s;ented the&s;e to be ab&s;urd. The
nece&s;&s;ity, however, of concealing the &s;ecret,
with which Doroth&eacute;e had entru&s;ted her,
and which mu&s;t have been mentioned, with
the late occurrence, in excu&s;e for her hav|ing
&s;o privately vi&s;ited the north apart|ments,
kept her entirely &s;ilent on the &s;ub|ject
of her apprehen&s;ion; and &s;he tried on|ly
to &s;ooth Annette, who held, that Ludo|vico
was certainly to be de&s;troyed; and who
was much le&s;s affected by Emily's con&s;o|latory
efforts, than by the manner of old
Doroth&eacute;e, who often, as &s;he exclaimed Lu|dovico,
&s;ighed, and threw up her eyes to

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Count gave orders for the north
apartments to be opened and prepared for
the reception of Ludovico; but Doroth&eacute;e,
remembering what &s;he had lately witne&s;&s;ed
there, feared to obey, and, not one of the
other &s;ervants daring to venture thither, the
rooms remained &s;hut up till the time when
Ludovico was to retire thither for the night,
an hour, for which the whole hou&s;ehold
waited with impatience.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, Ludovico, by the order of
the Count, attended him in his clo&s;et, where
they remained alone for near half an hour,
and, on leaving which, his Lord delivered
to him a &s;word.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">
"It has &s;een &s;ervice in mortal quarrels,"
&s;aid the Count, joco&s;ely, "you will u&s;e it
honourably, no doubt, in a &s;piritual one.
To-morrow, let me hear that there is not
one gho&s;t remaining in the chateau."</P>
<P>Ludovico received it with a re&s;pectful
bow. "You &s;hall be obeyed, my Lord,"
&s;aid he; "I will engage, that no &s;pectre
&s;hall di&s;turb the peace of the chateau after
this night."</P>
<P>They now returned to the &s;upper-room,
where the Count's gue&s;ts awaited to accom|pany
him and Ludovico to the door of the
north apartments, and Doroth&eacute;e, being &s;um|moned
for the keys, delivered them to Lu|dovico,
who then led the way, followed by
mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the chateau.
Having reached the back &s;tair-ca&s;e, &s;everal
of the &s;ervants &s;hrunk back, and refu&s;ed to
go further, but the re&s;t followed him to the
top of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, where a broad landing|place
allowed them to flock round him,
while he applied the key to the door,
during which they watched him with as
<PB N="90" REF="92">
much eager curio&s;ity as if he had been per|forming
&s;ome magical rite.</P>
<P>Ludovico, unaccu&s;tomed to the lock,
could not turn it, and Doroth&eacute;e, who had
lingered far behind, was called forward,
under who&s;e hand the door opened &s;lowly,
and, her eye glancing within the du&s;ky
chamber, &s;he uttered a &s;udden &s;hriek, and
retreated. At this &s;ignal of alarm, the
greater part of the crowd hurried down the
&s;tairs, and the Count, Henri and Ludovico
were left alone to pur&s;ue the enquiry, who
in&s;tantly ru&s;hed into the apartment, Ludo|vico
with a drawn &s;word, which he had ju&s;t
time to draw from the &s;cabbard, the Count
with the lamp in his hand, and Henri car|rying
a ba&s;ket, containing provi&s;ion for the
courageous adventurer.</P>
<P>Having looked ha&s;tily round the fir&s;t
room, where nothing appeared to ju&s;tify
alarm, they pa&s;&s;ed on to the &s;econd; and,
here too all being quiet, they proceeded to
a third in a more tempered &s;tep. The
Count had now lei&s;ure to &s;mile at the di&s;|compo&s;ure,
<PB N="91" REF="93">
into which he had been &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
and to a&s;k Ludovico in which room
he de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night.</P>
<P>"There are &s;everal chambers beyond
the&s;e, your <HI>Excellenza,</HI>" &s;aid Ludovico,
pointing to a door, "and in one of them is
a bed, they &s;ay. I will pa&s;s the night there,
and when I am weary of watching, I can
lie down."</P>
<P>"Good;" &s;aid the Count, "let us go on.
You &s;ee the&s;e rooms &s;hew nothing, but damp
walls and decaying furniture. I have been
&s;o much engaged &s;ince I came to the cha|teau,
that I have not looked into them till
now. Remember, Ludovico, to tell the
hou&s;ekeeper, to-morrow, to throw open
the&s;e windows. The dama&s;k hangings are
dropping to pieces, I will have them taken
down, and this antique furniture removed."</P>
<P>"Dear &s;ir!" &s;aid Henri, "here is an
arm-chair &s;o ma&s;&s;y with gilding, that it re|&s;embles
one of the &s;tate chairs at the Lou|vre,
more than any thing el&s;e."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid the Count, &s;topping a mo|ment
<PB N="92" REF="94">
to &s;urvey it, "there is a hi&s;tory be|longing
to that chair, but I have not time
to tell it.&mdash;Let us pa&s;s on. This &s;uite runs
to a greater extent than I had imagined; it
is many years &s;ince I was in them. But
where is the bed-room you &s;peak of, Ludo|vico?&mdash;the&s;e
are only anti-chambers to the
great drawing-room. I remember them in
their &s;plendour!"</P>
<P>"The bed, my Lord," replied Ludovico,
"they told me, was in a room that opens be|yond
the &s;aloon, and terminates the &s;uite."</P>
<P>"O, here is the &s;aloon," &s;aid the Count,
as they entered the &s;pacious apartment, in
which Emily and Doroth&eacute;e had re&s;ted. He
here &s;tood for a moment, &s;urveying the re|liques
of faded grandeur, which it exhi|bited&mdash;the
&s;umptuous tape&s;try&mdash;the long
and low &s;ophas of velvet, with frames hea|vily
carved and gilded&mdash;the floor inlaid
with &s;mall &s;quares of fine marble, and co|vered
in the centre with a piece of very
rich tape&s;try-work&mdash;the ca&s;ements of paint|ed
gla&s;s; and the large Venetian mirrors, of
<PB N="93" REF="95">
a &s;ize and quality, &s;uch as at that period
France could not make, which reflected, on
every &s;ide, the &s;pacious apartment. The&s;e
had formerly al&s;o reflected a gay and bril|liant
&s;cene, for this had been the &s;tate-room
of the chateau, and here the Marchione&s;s
had held the a&s;&s;emblies, that made part of the
fe&s;tivities of her nuptials. If the wand of
a magician could have recalled the vani&s;hed
groups, many of them vani&s;hed even from
the earth! that once had pa&s;&s;ed over the&s;e
poli&s;hed mirrors, what a varied and con|tra&s;ted
picture would they have exhibited
with the pre&s;ent! Now, in&s;tead of a blaze
of lights, and a &s;plendid and bu&s;y crowd,
they reflected only the rays of the one glim|mering
lamp, which the Count held up,
and which &s;carcely &s;erved to &s;hew the three
forlorn figures, that &s;tood &s;urveying the
room, and the &s;pacious and du&s;ky walls
around them.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid the Count to Henri, awak|ing
from his deep reverie, "how the &s;cene
is changed &s;ince la&s;t I &s;aw it! I was a
<PB N="94" REF="96">
young man, then, and the Marchione&s;s was
alive and in her bloom; many other per|&s;ons
were here, too, who are now no more!
There &s;tood the orche&s;tra; here we tripped
in many a &s;prightly maze&mdash;the walls echo|ing
to the dance! Now, they re&s;ound only
one feeble voice&mdash;and even that will, ere
long, be heard no more! My &s;on, remem|ber,
that I was once as young as your&s;elf,
and that you mu&s;t pa&s;s away like tho&s;e, who
have preceded you&mdash;like tho&s;e, who, as they
&s;ung and danced in this once gay apart|ment,
forgot, that years are made up of
moments, and that every &s;tep they took
carried them nearer to their graves. But
&s;uch reflections are u&s;ele&s;s, I had almo&s;t &s;aid
criminal, unle&s;s they teach us to prepare for
eternity, &s;ince, otherwi&s;e, they cloud our
pre&s;ent happine&s;s, without guiding us to a
future one. But enough of this; let us go
on."</P>
<P>Ludovico now opened the door of the
bed-room, and the Count, as he entered,
was &s;truck with the funereal appearance,
<PB N="95" REF="97">
which the dark arras gave to it. He ap|proached
the bed, with an emotion of &s;o|lemnity,
and, perceiving it to be covered
with the pall of black velvet, pau&s;ed;
"What can this mean?" &s;aid he, as he
gazed upon it.</P>
<P>"I have heard, my Lord," &s;aid Ludovico,
as he &s;tood at the feet, looking within the
canopied curtains, "that the Lady Mar|chione&s;s
de Villeroi died in this chamber,
and remained here till &s;he was removed to
be buried; and this, perhaps, Signor, may
account for the pall."</P>
<P>The Count made no reply, but &s;tood for
a few moments engaged in thought, and
evidently much affected. Then, turning
to Ludovico, he a&s;ked him with a &s;eri|ous
air, whether he thought his courage
would &s;upport him through the night? "If
you doubt this," added the Count, "do not
be a&s;hamed to own it; I will relea&s;e you
from your engagement, without expo&s;ing
you to the triumphs of your fellow &s;er|vants."</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">
Ludovico pau&s;ed; pride, and &s;omething
very like fear, &s;eemed &s;truggling in his
brea&s;t; pride, however, was victorious;&mdash;he
blu&s;hed, and his he&s;itation cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"No, my Lord," &s;aid he, "I will go
through with what I have begun; and I am
grateful for your con&s;ideration. On that
hearth I will make a fire, and, with the
good cheer in this ba&s;ket, I doubt not I
&s;hall do well."</P>
<P>"Be it &s;o," &s;aid the Count; "but how
will you beguile the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the
night, if you do not &s;leep?"</P>
<P>"When I am weary, my Lord," replied
Ludovico, "I &s;hall not fear to &s;leep; in
the meanwhile I have a book, that will en|tertain
me."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid the Count, "I hope no|thing
will di&s;turb you; but if you &s;hould be
&s;eriou&s;ly alarmed in the night, come to my
apartment. I have too much confidence in
your good &s;en&s;e and courage, to believe you
will be alarmed on &s;light grounds; or &s;uffer
the gloom of this chamber, or its remote
<PB N="97" REF="99">
&s;ituation, to overcome you with ideal ter|rors.
To-morrow, I &s;hall have to thank
you for an important &s;ervice; the&s;e rooms
&s;hall then be thrown open, and my people
will be convinced of their error. Good
night, Ludovico; let me &s;ee you early in
the morning, and, remember what I lately
&s;aid to you."</P>
<P>"I will, my Lord; good night to your
<HI>Excellenza;</HI> let me attend you with the
light."</P>
<P>He lighted the Count and Henri through
the chambers to the outer door; on the land|ing-place
&s;tood a lamp, which one of the
affrighted &s;ervants had left, and Henri, as
he took it up, again bade Ludovico good
night, who, having re&s;pectfully returned
the wi&s;h, clo&s;ed the door upon them, and
fa&s;tened it. Then, as he retired to the
bed-chamber, he examined the rooms,
through which he pa&s;&s;ed, with more mi|nutene&s;s
than he had done before, for he
apprehended, that &s;ome per&s;on might have
concealed him&s;elf in them, for the purpo&s;e
<PB N="98" REF="100">
of frightening him. No one, however,
but him&s;elf, was in the&s;e chambers, and,
leaving open the doors, through which he
pa&s;&s;ed, he came again to the great drawing|room,
who&s;e &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ilent gloom
&s;omewhat awed him. For a moment he
&s;tood, looking back through the long &s;uite
of rooms he had quitted, and, as he turned,
perceiving a light and his own figure, re|flected
in one of the large mirrors, he &s;tart|ed.
Other objects too were &s;een ob&s;curely
on its dark &s;urface, but he pau&s;ed not to
examine them, and returned ha&s;tily into
the bed-room, as he &s;urveyed which, he
ob&s;erved the door of the oriel, and opened
it. All within was &s;till. On looking
round, his eye was arre&s;ted by the por|trait
of the decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s, upon
which he gazed, for a con&s;iderable time,
with great attention and &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e;
and then, having examined the clo&s;et, he
returned into the bed-room, where he kin|dled
a wood fire, the bright blaze of which
revi&s;ed his &s;pirits, which had begun to yield
<PB N="99" REF="101">
to the gloom and &s;ilence of the place, for gu&s;ts
of wind alone broke at intervals this &s;ilence.
He now drew a &s;mall table and a chair near
the fire, took a bottle of wine, and &s;ome
cold provi&s;ion out of his ba&s;ket, and regaled
him&s;elf. When he had fini&s;hed his repa&s;t,
he laid his &s;word upon the table, and, not
feeling di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep, drew from his poc|ket
the book he had &s;poken of.&mdash;It was a
volume of old Proven&ccedil;al tales. Having
&s;tirred the fire into a brighter blaze, trim|med
his lamp, and drawn his chair upon
the hearth, he began to read, and his atten|tion
was &s;oon wholly occupied by the
&s;cenes, which the page di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, had returned to
the &s;upper-room, whither tho&s;e of the party,
who had attended him to the north apart|ment,
had retreated, upon hearing Doro|th&eacute;e's
&s;cream, and who were now earne&s;t in
their enquiries concerning tho&s;e chambers.
The Count rallied his gue&s;ts on their pre|cipitate
retreat, and on the &s;uper&s;titious in|clination
which had occa&s;ioned it, and his
<PB N="100" REF="102">
led to the que&s;tion, Whether the &s;pirit, af|ter
it has quitted the body, is ever permit|ted
to revi&s;it the earth; and if it is, whether
it was po&s;&s;ible for &s;pirits to become vi&s;ible
to the &s;en&s;e. The Baron was of opinion,
that the fir&s;t was probable, and the la&s;t was
po&s;&s;ible, and he endeavoured to ju&s;tify this
opinion by re&s;pectable authorities, both an|cient
and modern, which he quoted. The
Count, however, was decidedly again&s;t him,
and a long conver&s;ation en&s;ued, in which the
u&s;ual arguments on the&s;e &s;ubjects were on
both &s;ides brought forward with &s;kill, and
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with candour, but without convert|ing
either party to the opinion of his oppo|nent.
The effect of their conver&s;ation on
their auditors was various. Though the
Count had much the &s;uperiority of the Baron
in point of argument, he had con&s;iderably
fewer adherents; for that love, &s;o natural to
the human mind, of whatever is able to di&s;|tend
its faculties with wonder and a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
attached the majority of the company
to the &s;ide of the Baron; and, though many
<PB N="101" REF="103">
of the Count's propo&s;itions were unan&s;wer|able,
his opponents were inclined to believe
this the con&s;equence of their own want of
knowledge, on &s;o ab&s;tracted a &s;ubject, rather
than that arguments did not exi&s;t, which
were forcible enough to conquer his.</P>
<P>Blanche was pale with attention, till the
ridicule in her father's glance called a blu&s;h
upon her countenance, and &s;he then endea|voured
to forget the &s;uper&s;titious tales &s;he
had been told in her convent. Meanwhile,
Emily had been li&s;tening with deep atten|tion
to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of what was to her a
very intere&s;ting que&s;tion, and, remembering
the appearance &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in the
apartment of the late Marchione&s;s, &s;he was
frequently chilled with awe. Several times
&s;he was on the point of mentioning what &s;he
had &s;een, but the fear of giving pain to the
Count, and the dread of his ridicule, re|&s;trained
her; and, awaiting in anxious expec|tation
the event of Ludovico's intrepidity,
&s;he determined that her future &s;ilence &s;hould
depend upon it.</P>
<P>When the party had &s;eparated for the
<PB N="102" REF="104">
night, and the Count retired to his dre&s;&s;ing|room,
the remembrance of the de&s;olate
&s;cenes he had lately witne&s;&s;ed in his own
man&s;ion deeply affected him, but at length
he was arou&s;ed from his reverie and his
&s;ilence. "What mu&s;ic is that I hear?"&mdash;&s;aid
he &s;uddenly to his valet, "Who plays
at this late hour?"</P>
<P>The man made no reply, and the Count
continued to li&s;ten, and then added, "That
is no common mu&s;ician; he touches the in|&s;trument
with a delicate hand; who is it,
Pierre?"</P>
<P>"My Lord!" &s;aid the man, he&s;itatingly.</P>
<P>"Who plays that in&s;trument?" repeated
the Count.</P>
<P>"Does not your lord&s;hip know, then?"
&s;aid the valet.</P>
<P>"What mean you?" &s;aid the Count,
&s;omewhat &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"Nothing, my Lord, I meant nothing,"
rejoined the man &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively&mdash;"Only&mdash;that
mu&s;ic&mdash;goes about the hou&s;e at mid|night
<PB N="103" REF="105">
often, and I thought your lord&s;hip
might have heard it before."</P>
<P>"Mu&s;ic goes about the hou&s;e at mid|night!
Poor fellow!&mdash;does nobody dance
to the mu&s;ic, too?"</P>
<P>"It is not in the chateau, I believe, my
Lord; the &s;ounds come from the woods,
they &s;ay, though they &s;eem &s;o near;&mdash;but
then a &s;pirit can do any thing!"</P>
<P>"Ah, poor fellow!" &s;aid the Count, "I
perceive you are as &s;illy as the re&s;t of them;
to-morrow, you will be convinced of your
ridiculous error. But hark!&mdash;what voice
is that?"</P>
<P>"O my Lord! that is the voice we of|ten
hear with the mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>"Often!" &s;aid the Count, "How often,
pray? It is a very fine one."</P>
<P>"Why, my Lord, I my&s;elf have not
heard it more than two or three times, but
there are tho&s;e who have lived here longer,
that have heard it often enoush."</P>
<P>"What a &s;well was that!" exclaimed
the Count, as he &s;till li&s;tened, "And now,
<PB N="104" REF="106">
what a dying cadence! This is &s;urely &s;ome|thing
more than mortal!"</P>
<P>"That is what they &s;ay, my Lord," &s;aid
the valet; "they &s;ay it is nothing mortal,
that utters it; and if I might &s;ay my
thoughts"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Peace!" &s;aid the Count, and he li&s;tened
till the &s;train died away.</P>
<P>"This is &s;trange!" &s;aid he, as he turned
from the window, "Clo&s;e the ca&s;ements,
Pierre."</P>
<P>Pierre obeyed, and the Count &s;oon after
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, but did not &s;o &s;oon lo&s;e the
remembrance of the mu&s;ic, which long vi|brated
in his fancy in tones of melting &s;weet|ne&s;s,
while &s;urpri&s;e and perplexity engaged
his thoughts.</P>
<P>Ludovico, meanwhile, in his remote
chamber, heard, now and then, the faint
echo of a clo&s;ing door, as the family retired
to re&s;t, and then the hall clock, at a great
di&s;tance, &s;trike twelve. "It is midnight,"
&s;aid he, and he looked &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly round
the &s;pacious chamber. The fire on the
<PB N="105" REF="107">
hearth was now nearly expiring, for his at|tention
having been engaged by the book
before him, he had forgotten every thing
be&s;ides; but he &s;oon added fre&s;h wood,
not becau&s;e he was cold, though the night
was &s;tormy, but becau&s;e he was cheerle&s;s;
and, having again trimmed his lamp, he
poured out a gla&s;s of wine, drew his chair
nearer to the crackling blaze, tried to be deaf
to the wind, that howled mournfully at the
ca&s;ements, endeavoured to ab&s;tract his mind
from the melancholy, that was &s;tealing upon
him, and again took up his book. It had
been lent to him by Doroth&eacute;e, who had for|merly
picked it up in anob&s;cure corner of the
Marquis's library, and who, having opened
it and perceived &s;ome of the marvels it re|lated,
had carefully pre&s;erved it for her
own entertainment, its condition giving her
&s;ome excu&s;e for detaining it from its proper
&s;tation. The damp corner into which it had
fallen, had cau&s;ed the cover to be disfigured
and mouldy, and the leaves to be &s;o di&s;|coloured
with &s;pots, that it was not without
<PB N="106" REF="108">
difficulty the letters could be traced. The
fictions of the Proven&ccedil;al writers, whether
drawn from the Arabian legends, brought
by the Saracens into Spain, or recounting
the chivalric exploits performed by the
cru&s;aders, whom the Troubadours accom|panied
to the ea&s;t, were generally &s;plendid
and always marvellous, both in &s;cenery and
incident; and it is not wonderful, that Do|roth&eacute;e
and Ludovico &s;hould be fa&s;cinated by
inventions, which had captivated the carele&s;s
imagination in every rank of &s;ociety, in a
former age. Some of the tales, however, in
the book now before Ludovico, were of
&s;imple &s;tructure, and exhibited nothing of
the magnificent machinery and heroic man|ners,
which u&s;ually characterized the fables
of the twelfth century, and of this de&s;crip|tion
was the one he now happened to open,
which, in its original &s;tyle, was of great
length, but which may be thus &s;hortly re|lated.
The reader will perceive, that it is
&s;trongly tinctured with the &s;uper&s;tition of
the times.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROVEN&Ccedil;AL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived, in the province of Bretagne,
a noble Baron, famous for his-magnificence
and courtly ho&s;pitalities. His ca&s;tle was
graced with ladies of exqui&s;ite beauty, and
thronged with illu&s;trious knights; for the
honours he paid to feats of chivalry invited
the brave of di&s;tant countries to enter his
li&s;ts, and his court was more &s;plendid than
tho&s;e of many princes. Eight min&s;trels were
retained in his &s;ervice, who u&s;ed to &s;ing to
their harps romantic fictions, taken from
the Arabians, or adventures of chivalry, that
befel knights during the cru&s;ades, or the
martial deeds of the Baron, their lord;&mdash;while
he, &s;urrounded by his knights and
ladies, banqueted in the great hall of his
ca&s;tle, where the co&s;tly tape&s;try, that adorned
the walls with pictured exploits of his an|ce&s;tors,
the ca&s;ements of painted gla&s;s, en|riched
with armorial bearings, the gorgeous
banners, that waved along the roof, the
&s;umptuous canopies, the profu&s;ion of gold
<PB N="108" REF="110">
and &s;ilver, that glittered on the &s;ideboards,
the numerous di&s;hes, that covered the tables,
the number and gay liveries of the atten|dants,
with the chivalric and &s;plendid attire
of the gue&s;ts, united to form a &s;cene of
magnificence, &s;uch as we may not hope to
&s;ee in the&s;e <HI>degenerate days.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Baron, the following adventure is
related. One night, having retired late from
the banquet to his chamber, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
his attendants, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by the ap|pearance
of a &s;tranger of a noble air, but of
a &s;orrowful and dejected countenance. Be|lieving,
that this per&s;on had been &s;ecreted
in the apartment, &s;ince it appeared impo&s;|&s;ible
he could have lately pa&s;&s;ed the anti|room,
unob&s;erved by the pages in waiting,
who would have prevented this intru&s;ion on
their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his
people, drew his &s;word, which he had not
yet taken from his &s;ide, and &s;tood upon his
defence. The &s;tranger &s;lowly advancing,
told him, that there was nothing to fear;
that he came with no ho&s;tile de&s;ign, but to
<PB N="109" REF="111">
communicate to him a terrible &s;ecret, which
it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know.</P>
<P>The Baron, appea&s;ed by the courteous
manners of the &s;tranger, after &s;urveying him,
for &s;ome time, in &s;ilence, returned his &s;word
into the &s;cabbard, and de&s;ired him to explain
the means, by which he had obtained acce&s;s
to the chamber, and the purpo&s;e of this ex|traordinary
vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Without an&s;wering either of the&s;e enqui|ries,
the &s;tranger &s;aid, that he could not then
explain him&s;elf, but that, if the Baron would
follow him to the edge of the fore&s;t, at a
&s;hort di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle walls, he would
there convince him, that he had &s;omething
of importance to di&s;clo&s;e.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al again alarmed the Baron,
who could &s;carcely believe, that the &s;tranger
meant to draw him to &s;o &s;olitary a &s;pot, at
this hour of the night, without harbouring
a de&s;ign again&s;t his life, and he refu&s;ed to
go, ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that, if the
&s;tranger's purpo&s;e was an honourable one, he
would not per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to reveal the
<PB N="110" REF="112">
occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it, in the apartment where
they were.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke this, he viewed the
&s;tranger &s;till more attentively than before,
but ob&s;erved no change in his countenance,
or any &s;ymptom, that might intimate a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil de&s;ign. He was ha|bited
like a knight, was of a tall and ma|je&s;tic
&s;tature, and of dignified and courteous
manners. Still, however, he refu&s;ed to com|municate
the &s;ubject of his errand in any
place, but that he had mentioned, and, at
the &s;ame time, gave hints concerning the
&s;ecret he would di&s;clo&s;e, that awakened a de|gree
of &s;olemn curio&s;ity in the Baron, which,
at length, induced him to con&s;ent to follow
the &s;tranger, on certain conditions.</P>
<P>"Sir knight," &s;aid he, "I will attend
you to the fore&s;t, and will take with me only
four of my people, who &s;hall witne&s;s our
conference."</P>
<P>To this, however, the Knight objected.</P>
<P>"What I would di&s;clo&s;e," &s;aid he, with
&s;olemnity, "is to you alone. There are
<PB N="111" REF="113">
only three living per&s;ons, to whom the cir|cum&s;tance
is known; it is of more con&s;e|quence
to you and your hou&s;e, than I &s;hall
now explain. In future years, you will look
back to this night with &s;atisfaction or re|pentance,
accordingly as you now determine.
As you would hereafter pro&s;per&mdash;follow
me; I pledge you the honour of a knight,
that no evil &s;hall befall you;&mdash;if you are
contented to dare futurity&mdash;remain in your
chamber, and I will depart as I came."</P>
<P>"Sir knight," replied the Baron, "how
is it po&s;&s;ible, that my future peace can de|pend
upon my pre&s;ent determination?"</P>
<P>"That is not now to be told," &s;aid the
&s;tranger, "I have explained my&s;elf to the
utmo&s;t. It is late; if you follow me it mu&s;t
be quickly;&mdash;you will do well to con&s;ider
the alternative."</P>
<P>The Baron mu&s;ed, and, as he looked
upon the knight, he perceived his counte|nance
a&s;&s;ume a &s;ingular &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>[Here Ludovico thought he heard a noi&s;e,
and he threw a glance round the chamber,
<PB N="112" REF="114">
and then held up the lamp to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ob|&s;ervation;
but, not perceiving any thing to
confirm his alarm, he took up the book
again and pur&s;ued the &s;tory.]</P>
<P>The Baron paced his apartment, for
&s;ome time, in &s;ilence, impre&s;&s;ed by the la&s;t
words of the &s;tranger, who&s;e extraordinary
reque&s;t he feared to grant, and feared, al&s;o,
to refu&s;e. At length, he &s;aid, "Sir knight,
you are utterly unknown to me; tell me
your&s;elf,&mdash;is it rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould
tru&s;t my&s;elf alone with a &s;tranger, at this
hour, in a &s;olitary fore&s;t? Tell me, at lea&s;t,
who you are, and who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ecrete you
in this chamber."</P>
<P>The knight frowned at the&s;e latter words,
and was a moment &s;ilent; then, with a coun|tenance
&s;omewhat &s;tern, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I am an Engli&s;h knight; I am called
Sir Bevys of Lanca&s;ter,&mdash;and my deeds are
not unknown at the Holy City, whence
I was returning to my native land, when
I was benighted in the neighbouring fore&s;t."</P>
<P>"Your name is not unknown to fame,"
<PB N="113" REF="115">
&s;aid the Baron, "I have heard of it."
(The Knight looked haughtily.) "But
why, &s;ince my ca&s;tle is known to entertain
all true knights, did not your herald an|nounce
you? Why did you not appear at
the banquet, where your pre&s;ence would
have been welcomed, in&s;tead of hiding your|&s;elf
in my ca&s;tle and &s;tealing to my cham|ber,
at midnight?"</P>
<P>The &s;tranger frowned, and turned away in
&s;ilence; but the Baron repeated the que&s;tions.</P>
<P>"I come not," &s;aid the Knight, "to an|&s;wer
enquiries, but to reveal facts. If you
would know more, follow me, and again I
pledge the honour of a Knight, that you
&s;hall return in &s;afety.&mdash;Be quick in your de|termination&mdash;I
mu&s;t be gone."</P>
<P>After &s;ome further he&s;itation, the Baron
determined to follow the &s;tranger, and to
&s;ee the re&s;ult of his extraordinary reque&s;t;
he, therefore, again drew forth his &s;word,
and, taking up a lamp, bade the Knight lead
on. The latter obeyed, and, opening the
door of the chamber, they pa&s;&s;ed into the
<PB N="114" REF="116">
anti-room, where the Baron, &s;urpri&s;ed to find
all his pages a&s;leep, &s;topped, and, with ha&s;ty
violence, was going to reprimand them for
their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, when the Knight waved
his hand, and looked &s;o expre&s;&s;ively upon
the Baron, that the latter re&s;trained his re|&s;entment,
and pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P>The Knight, having de&s;cended a &s;tair|ca&s;e,
opened a &s;ecret door, which the Baron
had believed was known only to him&s;elf,
and, proceeding through &s;everal narrow and
winding pa&s;&s;ages, came, at length, to a &s;mall
gate, that opened beyond the walls of the
ca&s;tle. Meanwhile, the Baron followed in
&s;ilence and amazement, on perceiving that
the&s;e &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ages were &s;o well known to
a &s;tranger, and felt inclined to return from
an adventure, that appeared to partake of
treachery, as well as danger. Then, con|&s;idering
that he was armed, and ob&s;erv|ing
the courteous and noble air of his con|ductor,
his courage returned, he blu&s;hed,
that it had failed him for a moment, and he
re&s;olved to trace the my&s;tery to its &s;ource.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">
He now found him&s;elf on the heathy
platform, before the great gates of his ca&s;tle,
where, on looking up, he perceived lights
glimmering in the different ca&s;ements of the
gue&s;ts, who were retiring to &s;leep; and,
while he &s;hivered in the bla&s;t, and looked
on the dark and de&s;olate &s;cene around him,
he thought of the comforts of his warm
chamber, rendered cheerful by the blaze of
wood, and felt, for a moment, the full con|tra&s;t
of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>[Here Ludovico pau&s;ed a moment, and,
looking at his own fire, gave it a brightening
&s;tir.]</P>
<P>The wind was &s;trong, and the Baron
watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting
every moment to &s;ee it extingui&s;hed; but,
though the flame wavered, it did not expire,
and he &s;till followed the &s;tranger, who often
&s;ighed as he went, but did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>When they reached the borders of the
fore&s;t, the Knight turned, and rai&s;ed his head,
as if he meant to addre&s;s the Baron, but then,
clo&s;ing his lips in &s;ilence, he walked on.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
As they entered, beneath the dark and
&s;preading boughs, the Baron, affected by
the &s;olemnity of the &s;ccne, he&s;itated whe|ther
to proceed, and demanded how much
further they were to go. The Knight replied
only by a ge&s;ture, and the Baron, with he&s;i|tating
&s;teps and a &s;u&s;picious eye, followed
through an ob&s;cure and intricate path, till,
having proceeded a con&s;iderable way, he
again demanded whither they were going,
and refu&s;ed to proceed unle&s;s he was in|formed.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he looked at his own
&s;word, and at the Knight alternately, who
&s;hook his head, and who&s;e dejected counte|nance
di&s;armed the Baron, for a moment,
of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>"A little further is the place, whither I
would lead you," &s;aid the &s;tranger; "no evil
&s;hall befall you&mdash;I have &s;worn it on the ho|nour
of a knight."</P>
<P>The Baron, re-a&s;&s;ured, again followed in
&s;ilence, and they &s;oon arrived at a deep re|ce&s;s
of the fore&s;t, where the dark and lofty
<PB N="117" REF="119">
che&s;nuts entirely excluded the &s;ky, and which
was &s;o overgrown with underwood, that they
proceeded with difficulty. The Knight &s;ighed
deeply as he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes pau&s;ed;
and having, at length, reached a &s;pot, where
the trees crowded into a knot, he turned,
and, with a terrific look, pointing to the
ground, the Baron &s;aw there the body of
a man, &s;tretched at its length, and welter|ing
in blood; a gha&s;tly wound was on the
forehead, and death appeared already to have
contracted the features.</P>
<P>The Baron, on perceiving the &s;pectacle,
&s;tarted in horror, looked at the Knight for
explanation, and was then going to rai&s;e the
body and examine if there were yet any re|mains
of life; but the &s;tranger, waving his
hand, fixed upon him a look &s;o earne&s;t and
mournful, as not only much &s;urpri&s;ed him,
but made him de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But, what were the Baron's emotions,
when, an holding the lamp near the features
of the corp&s;e, he di&s;covered the exact re&s;em|blance
of the &s;tranger his conductor, to
<PB N="118" REF="120">
whom he now looked up in a&s;toni&s;hment
and enquiry? As he gazed, he perceived
the countenance of the Knight change, and
begin to fade, till his whole form gradually
vani&s;hed from his a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;e! While
the Baron &s;tood, fixed to the &s;pot, a voice
was heard to utter the&s;e words:&mdash;</P>
<P>[Ludovico &s;tarted, and laid down the
book, for he thought he heard a voice in
the chamber, and he looked toward the bed,
where, however, he &s;aw only the dark cur|tains
and the pall. He li&s;tened, &s;carcely
daring to draw his breath, but heard only
the di&s;tant roaring of the &s;ea in the &s;torm,
and the bla&s;t, that ru&s;hed by the ca&s;ements;
when, concluding, that he had been de|ceived
by its &s;ighings, he took up his book
to fini&s;h the &s;tory.]</P>
<P>While the Baron &s;tood, fixed to the
&s;pot, a voice was heard to utter the&s;e
words:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The body of Sir Bevys of Lanca&s;ter,
a noble knight of England, lies before you.
He was, this night, way laid and murdered,
<PB N="119" REF="121">
as he journeyed from the Holy City towards
his native land. Re&s;pect the honour of
knighthood and the law of humanity; inter
the body in chri&s;tian ground, and cau&s;e his
murderers to be puni&s;hed. As ye ob&s;erve,
or neglect this, &s;hall peace and happine&s;s,
or war and mi&s;ery, light upon you and your
hou&s;e for ever"</P>
<P>The Baron, when he recovered from the
awe and a&s;toni&s;hment, into which this ad|venture
had thrown him, returned to his
ca&s;tle, whither he cau&s;ed the body of Sir
Bevys to be removed; and, on the following
day, it was interred, with the honours of
knighthood, in the chapel of the ca&s;tle, at|tended
by all the noble knights and ladies,
who graced the court of the Baron de
Brunne.</P>

<P>Ludovico, having fini&s;hed this &s;tory, laid
a&s;ide the book, for he felt drow&s;y, and, after
putting more wood on the fire and taking
another gla&s;s of wine, he repo&s;ed him&s;elf in
the arm chair on the hearth. In his dream he
<PB N="120" REF="122">
&s;till beheld the chamber where he really was,
and, once or twice, &s;tarted from imperfect
&s;lumbers, imagining he &s;aw a man's face,
looking over the high back of his arm-chair.
This idea had &s;o &s;trongly-impre&s;&s;ed him, that,
when he rai&s;ed his eyes, he almo&s;t expected to
meet other eyes, fixed upon his own, and he
quitted his &s;eat and looked behind the chair,

but, the outer door having been fa&s;t|ened,
on the preceding night, he was ob|liged
to knock loudly for admittance.
Neither the knocking, or his voice was
heard; but, con&s;idering the di&s;tance of this
door from the bed-room, and that Ludo|vico,
wearied with watching, had probably
fallen into a deep &s;leep, the Count was not
&s;urpri&s;ed on receiving no an&s;wer, and, leav|ing
the door, he went down to walk in his
grounds.</P>
<P>It was a gray autumnal morning. The
<PB N="122" REF="124">
&s;un, ri&s;ing over Provence, gave only a feeble
light, as his rays &s;truggled through the va|pours
that a&s;cended from the &s;ea, and &s;loated
heavily over the wood-tops, which were now
varied with many a mellow tint of autumn.
The &s;torm was pa&s;&s;ed, but the waves were
yet violently agitated, and their cour&s;e was
traced by long lines of foam, while not a
breeze &s;luttered in the &s;ails of the ve&s;&s;els,
near the &s;hore, that were weighing anchor
to depart. The &s;till gloom of the hour
was plea&s;ing to the Count, and he pur|&s;ued
his way through the woods, &s;unk in
deep thought.</P>
<P>Emily al&s;o ro&s;e at an early hour, and
took her cu&s;tomary walk along the brow
of the promontory, that overhung the Me|diterranean.
Her mind was now not oc|cupied
with the occurrences of the chateau,
and Valancourt was the &s;ubject of her
mournful thoughts; whom &s;he had not
yet taught her&s;elf to con&s;ider with indiffer|ence,
though her judgment con&s;tantly re|proached
her for the affection, that lingered
<PB N="123" REF="125">
in her heart, after her e&s;teem for him was
departed. Remembrance frequently gave
her his parting look and the tones of his
voice, when he had bade her a la&s;t farewel;
and, &s;ome accidental a&s;&s;ociations now recall|ing
the&s;e circum&s;tances to her fancy, with
peculiar energy, &s;he &s;hed bitter tears to the
recollection.</P>
<P>Having reached the watch-tower, &s;he
&s;eated her&s;elf on the broken &s;teps, and, in
melancholy dejection, watched the waves,
half hid in vapour, as they came rolling to|wards
the &s;hore, and threw up their light
&s;pray round the rocks below. Their hollow
murmur and the ob&s;curing mi&s;ts, that came
in wreaths up the cliff&s;s, gave a &s;olemnity
to the &s;cene, which was in harmony with
the temper of her mind, and &s;he &s;at, given
up to the remembrance of pa&s;t times, till
this became too painful, and &s;he abruptly
quitted the place. On pa&s;&s;ing the little
gate of the watch-tower, &s;he ob&s;erved let|ters,
engraved on the &s;tone po&s;tern, which
&s;he pau&s;ed to examine, and, though they
<PB N="124" REF="126">
appeared to have been rudely cut with a
pen-knife, the characters were familiar to
her; at length, recognizing the hand-writ|ing
of Valancourt, &s;he read, with trembling
anxiety, the following lines, entitled</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SHIPWRECK.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis &s;olemn midnight! On this lonely &s;teep,</L>
<L>Beneath this watch-tow'r's de&s;olated wall,</L>
<L>Where my&s;tic &s;hapes the wonderer appall,</L>
<L>I re&s;t; and view below the de&s;ert deep,</L>
<L>As through tempe&s;tuous clouds the moon's cold light</L>
<L>Gleams on the wave. Viewle&s;s, the winds of night</L>
<L>With loud my&s;terious force the billows &s;weep,</L>
<L>And &s;ullen roar the &s;urges, far below.</L>
<L>In the &s;till pau&s;es of the gu&s;t I hear</L>
<L>The voice of &s;pirits, ri&s;ing &s;weet and &s;low,</L>
<L>And oft among the clouds their forms appear.</L>
<L>But hark! what &s;hriek of death comes in the gale,</L>
<L>And in the di&s;tant ray what glimmering &s;ail</L>
<L>Bends to the &s;torm?&mdash;Now &s;inks the note of fear!</L>
<L>Ah! wretched mariners!&mdash;no more &s;hall day</L>
<L>Unclo&s;e his cheering eye to light ye on your way!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>From the&s;e lines it appeared, that Va|lancourt
had vi&s;ited the tower; that he had
probably been here on the preceding night,
<PB N="125" REF="127">
for it was &s;uch an one as they de&s;cribed,
and that he had left the building very late|ly,
&s;ince it had not long been light, and
without light it was impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e letters
could have been cut. It was thus even
probable, that he might be yet in the gar|dens.</P>
<P>As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed rapidly over
the mind of Emily, they called up a variety
of contending emotions, that almo&s;t over|came
her &s;pirits; but her fir&s;t impul&s;e was
to avoid him, and, immediately leaving
the tower, &s;he returned, with ha&s;ty &s;teps,
towards the chateau. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along,
&s;he remembered the mu&s;ic &s;he had lately
heard near the tower, with the figure, which
had appeared, and, in this moment of agi|tation,
&s;he was inclined to believe, that
&s;he had then heard and &s;een Valancourt;
but other recollections &s;oon convinced her
of her error. On turning into a thicker
part of the woods, &s;he perceived a per&s;on,
walking &s;lowly in the gloom at &s;ome little
di&s;tance, and, her mind engaged by the
<PB N="126" REF="128">
idea of him, &s;he &s;tarted and pau&s;ed, ima|gining
this to be Valancourt. The per&s;on
advanced with quicker &s;teps, and, before
&s;he could recover recollection enough to
avoid him, he &s;poke, and &s;he then knew the
voice of the Count, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome
&s;urpri&s;e, on finding her walking at &s;o early
an hour, and made a feeble effort to rally
her on her love of &s;olitude. But he &s;oon
perceived this to be more a &s;ubject of con|cern
than of light laughter, and, changing
his manner, affectionately expo&s;tulated with
Emily, on thus indulging unavailing regret;
who, though &s;he acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s
of all he &s;aid, could not re&s;train her tears,
while &s;he did &s;o, and he pre&s;ently quitted
the topic. Expre&s;&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e at not hav|ing
yet heard from his friend, the Advo|cate
at Avignon, in an&s;wer to the que&s;tions
propo&s;ed to him, respecting the e&s;tates of
the late Madame Montoni, he, with friend|ly
zeal, endeavoured to cheer Emily with
hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing her claim to them;
while &s;he felt, that the e&s;tates could now
<PB N="127" REF="129">
contribute little to the happine&s;s of a life,
in which Valancourt had no longer an in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>When they returned to the chateau,
Emily retired to her apartment, and Count
De Villefort to the door of the north cham|bers.
This was &s;till fa&s;tened, but, being now
determined to arou&s;e Ludovico, he renewed
his calls more loudly than before, after
which a total &s;ilence en&s;ued, and the Count,
finding all his efforts to be heard ineffec|tual,
at length began to fear, that &s;ome ac|cident
had befallen Ludovico, whom ter|ror
of an imaginary being might have de|prived
of his &s;en&s;es. He, therefore, left
the door with an intention of &s;ummon|ing
his &s;ervants to force it open, &s;ome of
whom he now heard moving in the lower
part of the chateau.</P>
<P>To the Count's enquiries, whether they
had &s;een or heard Ludovico, they replied
in affright, that not one of them had ven|tured
on the north &s;ide of the chateau, &s;ince
the preceding night.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">
"He &s;leeps &s;oundly then," &s;aid the
Count, "and is at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the
outer door, which is fa&s;tened, that to gain
admittance to the chambers it will be nece&s;|&s;ary
to force it. Bring an in&s;trument, and
follow me."</P>
<P>The &s;ervants &s;tood mute and dejected,
and it was not till nearly all the hou&s;ehold
were a&s;&s;embled, that the Count's orders
were obeyed. In the mean time Doroth&eacute;e
was telling of a door, that opened from a
gallery, leading from the great &s;tair-ca&s;e
into the la&s;t anti-room of the &s;aloon, and,
this being much nearer to the bed-cham|ber,
it appeared probable, that Ludovico
might be ea&s;ily awakened by an attempt to
open it. Thither, therefore, the Count
went, but his voice was as ineffectual at
this door as it had proved at the remoter
one; and now, &s;eriou&s;ly intere&s;ted for Lu|dovico,
he was him&s;elf going to &s;trike upon
the door with the in&s;trument, when he ob|&s;erved
its &s;ingular beauty, and with-held
the blow. It appeared, on the fir&s;t glance,
<PB N="129" REF="131">
to be of ebony, &s;o dark and clo&s;e was its
grain and &s;o high its poli&s;h; but it proved
to be only of larch wood, of the growth of
Provence, then famous for its fore&s;ts of
larch. The beauty of its poli&s;hed hue and
of its delicate carvings determined the
Count to &s;pare this door, and he returned
to that leading from the back &s;tair-ca&s;e,
which being, at length, forced, he entered
the fir&s;t anti-room, followed by Henri
and a few of the mo&s;t courageous of his
&s;ervants, the re&s;t awaiting the event of
the enquiry on the &s;tairs and landing-place.</P>
<P>All was &s;ilent in the chambers, through
which the Count pa&s;&s;ed, and, having reach|ed
the &s;aloon, he called loudly upon Ludo|vico;
after which, &s;till receiving no an&s;wer,
he threw open the door of the bed-room,
and entered.</P>
<P>The profound &s;tillne&s;s within confirmed
his apprehen&s;ions for Ludovico, for not even
the breathings of a per&s;on in &s;leep were
heard; and his uncertainty was not &s;oon ter|minated,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
&s;ince, the &s;hutters being all clo&s;ed,
the chamber was too dark for any object to
be di&s;tingui&s;hed in it.</P>
<P>The Count bade a &s;ervant open them,
who, as he cro&s;&s;ed the room to do &s;o,
&s;tumbled over &s;omething, and fell to the
floor, when his cry occa&s;ioned &s;uch panic
among the few of his fellows, who had
ventured thus far, that they in&s;tantly fled,
and the Count and Henri were left to finish
the adventure.</P>
<P>Henri then &s;prung acro&s;s the room, and,
opening a window-&s;hutter, they perceived,
that the man had fallen over a chair near
the hearth, in which Ludovico had been
&s;itting;&mdash;for he &s;at there no longer, nor
could any where be &s;een by the imperfect
light, that was admitted into the apartment.
The Count, &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, now opened
other &s;hutters, that he might be enabled to
examine further, and, Ludovico not yet ap|pearing,
he &s;tood for a moment, &s;u&s;pended
in a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;carcely tru&s;ting his
&s;en&s;es, till, his eyes glancing on the bed, he
<PB N="131" REF="133">
advanced, to examine whether he was there
a&s;leep. No per&s;on, however, was in it,
and he proceeded to the oriel, where every
thing remained as on the preceding night,
but Ludovico was no where to be found.</P>
<P>The Count now checked his amazement,
con&s;idering, that Ludovico might have left
the chambers, during the night, overcome
by the terrors, which their lonely de&s;olation
and the recollected reports, concerning
them, had in&s;pired. Yet, if this had been
the fact, the man would naturally have
&s;ought &s;ociety, and his fellow &s;ervants had
all declared they had not &s;een him; the
door of the outer room al&s;o had been
found fa&s;tened, with the key on the in&s;ide;
it was impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, for him to
have pa&s;&s;ed through that, and all the outer
doors of this &s;uite were found, on examina|tion,
to be bolted and locked, with the
keys al&s;o within them. The Count, being
then compelled to believe, that the lad had
e&s;caped through the ca&s;ements, next exa|mined
them, but &s;uch as opened wide
<PB N="132" REF="134">
enough to admit the body of a man were
found to be carefully &s;ecured either by iron
bars, or by &s;hutters, and no ve&s;tige appear|ed
of any per&s;on having attempted to pa&s;s
them; neither was it probable, that Ludo|vico
would have incurred the ri&s;que of
breaking his neck, by leaping from a win|dow,
when he might have walked &s;afely
through a door.</P>
<P>The Count's amazement did not admit
of words; but he returned once more to ex|amine
the bed-room, where was no appear|ance
of di&s;order, except that occa&s;ioned by
the late overthrow of the chair, near which
had &s;tood a &s;mall table, and on this Lu|dovico's
&s;word, his lamp, the book he
had been reading, and the remnant of
his fla&s;k of wine &s;till remained. At the
foot of the table, too, was the ba&s;ket with
&s;ome fragments of provi&s;ion and wood.</P>
<P>Henri and the &s;ervant now uttered their
a&s;toni&s;hment without re&s;erve, and, though
the Count &s;aid little, there was a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
in his manner, that expre&s;&s;ed much. It ap|peared,
<PB N="133" REF="135">
that Ludovico mu&s;t have quitted
the&s;e rooms by &s;ome concealed pa&s;&s;age, for
the Count could not believe, that any &s;uper|natural
means had occa&s;ioned this event, yet,
if there was any &s;uch pa&s;&s;age, it &s;eemed inex|plicable
why he &s;hould retreat through it,
and it was equally &s;urpri&s;ing, that not even
the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige &s;hould appear, by which
his progre&s;s could be traced. In the rooms
every thing remained as much in order as
if he had ju&s;t walked out by the common
way.</P>
<P>The Count him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted in lifting the
arras, with which the bed-chamber, &s;aloon
and one of the anti-rooms were hung, that
he might di&s;cover if any door had been
concealed behind it; but, after a laborious
&s;earch, none was found, and he, at length,
quitted the apartments, having &s;ecured the
door of the la&s;t anti-chamber, the key of
which he took into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He
then gave orders, that &s;trict &s;earch &s;hould
be made for Ludovico not only in the cha|teau,
but in the neighbourhood, and, retir|ing
<PB N="134" REF="136">
with Henri to his clo&s;et, they remained
there in conver&s;ation for a con&s;iderable
time, and whatever was the &s;ubject of it,
Henri from this hour lo&s;t much of his vi|vacity,
and his manners were particularly
grave and re&s;erved, whenever the topic,
which now agitated the Count's family
with wonder and alarm, was introduced.</P>
<P>On the di&s;appearing of Ludovico, Baron
St. Foix &s;eemed &s;trengthened in all his for|mer
opinions concerning the probability of
apparitions, though it was difficult to di&s;|cover
what connection there could po&s;&s;ibly
be between the two &s;ubjects, or to account
for this effect otherwi&s;e than by &s;uppo&s;ing,
that the my&s;tery attending Ludovico, by
exciting awe and curio&s;ity, reduced the
mind to a &s;tate of &s;en&s;ibility, which ren|dered
it more liable to the influence of &s;u|per&s;tition
in general. It is, however, cer|tain,
that from this period the Baron and
his adherents became more bigoted to their
own &s;y&s;tems than before, while the terrors
of the Count's &s;ervants increa&s;ed to an ex|ce&s;s,
<PB N="135" REF="137">
that occa&s;ioned many of them to quit
the man&s;ion immediately, and the re&s;t re|mained
only till others could be procured,
to &s;upply their places.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;trenuous &s;earch after Ludo|vico
proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and, after &s;everal
days of indefatigable enquiry, poor An|nette
gave her&s;elf up to de&s;pair, and the
other inhabitants of the chateau to amaze|ment.</P>
<P>Emily, who&s;e mind had been deeply af|fected
by the di&s;a&s;trous fate of the late Mar|chione&s;s
and with the my&s;terious connec|tion,
which &s;he fancied had exi&s;ted between
her and St. Aubert, was particularly im|pre&s;&s;ed
by the late extraordinary event, and
much concerned for the lo&s;s of Ludovico,
who&s;e integrity and faithful &s;ervices claim|ed
both her e&s;teem and gratitude. She
was now very de&s;irous to return to the quiet
retirement of her convent, but every hint
of this was received with real &s;orrow by the
Lady Blanche, and affectionately &s;et a&s;ide
by the Count, for whom &s;he felt much of
<PB N="136" REF="138">
the re&s;pectful love and admiration of a
daughter, and to whom, by Doroth&eacute;e's con|&s;ent,
&s;he, at length mentioned the appear|ance,
which they had witne&s;&s;ed in the cham|ber
of the decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s. At any
other period, he would have &s;miled at &s;uch
a relation, and have believed, that its object
had exi&s;ted only in the di&s;tempered fancy of
the relater; but he now attended to Emily
with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and, when &s;he concluded,
reque&s;ted of her a promi&s;e, that this occur|rence
&s;hould re&s;t in &s;ilence. "Whatever
may be the cau&s;e and the import of the&s;e
extraordinary occurrences," added the
Count, "time only can explain them. I
&s;hall keep a wary eye upon all that pa&s;&s;es
in the chateau, and &s;hall pur&s;ue every po&s;|&s;ible
means of di&s;covering the fate of Lu|dovico.
Meanwhile, we mu&s;t be prudent
and be &s;ilent. I will my&s;elf watch in the
north chambers, but of this we will &s;ay no|thing,
till the night arrives, when I purpo&s;e
doing &s;o."</P>
<P>The Count then &s;ent for Doroth&eacute;e, and
<PB N="137" REF="139">
required of her al&s;o a promi&s;e of &s;ilence,
concerning what &s;he had already, or might
in future witne&s;s of an extraordinary na|ture;
and this ancient &s;ervant now related
to him the particulars of the Marchione&s;s
de Villeroi's death, with &s;ome of which he
appeared to be already acquainted, while
by others he was evidently &s;urpri&s;ed and
agitated. After li&s;tening to this narrative,
the Count retired to his clo&s;et, where he
remained alone for &s;everal hours; and,
when he again appeared, the folemnity of
his manner &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed Emily,
but &s;he gave no utterance to her thoughts.</P>
<P>On the week following the di&s;appearance
of Ludovico, all the Count's gue&s;ts took
leave of him, except the Baron, his &s;on
Mon&s;. St. Foix, and Emily; the latter of
whom was &s;oon after embarra&s;&s;ed and di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed
by the arrival of another vi&s;itor,
Mon&s;. Du Pont, which made her deter|mine
upon withdrawing to her convent im|mediately.
The delight, that appeared in
his countenance, when he met her, told
<PB N="138" REF="140">
that he brought back the &s;ame ardour of
pa&s;&s;ion, which had formerly bani&s;hed him
from Chateau-le-Blanc. He was received
with re&s;erve by Emily, and with plea&s;ure by
the Count, who pre&s;ented him to her with
a &s;mile, that &s;eemed intended to plead his
cau&s;e, and who did not hope the le&s;s for
his friend, from the embarra&s;&s;ment &s;he be|trayed.</P>
<P>But M. Du Pont, with truer &s;ympathy,
&s;eemed to under&s;tand her manner, and his
countenance quickly lo&s;t its vivacity, and
&s;unk into the languor of de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>On the following day, however, he &s;ought
an opportunity of declaring the purport of
bis vi&s;it, and renewed his &s;uit; a declara|tion,
which was received with real concern
by Emily, who endeavoured to le&s;&s;en the
pain &s;he might in&s;lict by a &s;econd rejection,
with a&s;&s;urances of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip; yet
&s;he left him in a &s;tate of mind, that claimed
and excited her tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion; and,
being more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the impro|priety
of remaining longer at the chateau,
<PB N="139" REF="141">
&s;he immediately &s;ought the Count, and
communicated to him her intention of re|turning
to the convent.</P>
<P>"My dear Emily," &s;aid he, "I ob&s;erve,
with extreme concern, the illu&s;ion you are
encouraging&mdash;an illu&s;ion common to young
and &s;en&s;ible minds. Your heart has re|ceived
a &s;evere &s;hock; you believe you can
never entirely recover it, and you will en|courage
this belief, till the habit of in|dulging
&s;orrow will &s;ubdue the &s;trength of
your mind, and di&s;colour your future views
with melancholy and regret. Let me di&s;&s;i|pate
this illu&s;ion, and awaken you to a &s;en&s;e
of your danger."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled mournfully, "I know
what you would &s;ay, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he,
"and am prepared to an&s;wer you. I feel,
that my heart can never know a &s;econd af|fection;
and that I mu&s;t never hope even to
recover its tranquillity&mdash;if I &s;uffer my&s;elf
to enter into a &s;econd engagement."</P>
<P>"I know, that you feel all this," replied
the Count; "and I know, al&s;o, that time
<PB N="140" REF="142">
will overcome the&s;e feelings, unle&s;s you che|ri&s;h
them in &s;olitude, and, pardon me, with
romantic tenderne&s;s. Then, indeed, time
will only confirm habit. I am particularly
empowered to &s;peak on this &s;ubject, and to
&s;ympathize in your &s;ufferings," added the
Count, with an air of &s;olemnity, "for I
have known what it is to love, and to la|ment
the object of my love. Yes," conti|nued
he, while his eyes filled with rears, "I
have &s;uffered!&mdash;but tho&s;e times have pa&s;&s;ed
away&mdash;long pa&s;&s;ed! and I can now look
back upon them without emotion."</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, timidly,
"what mean tho&s;e tears?&mdash;they &s;peak, I
fear, another language&mdash;they plead for me."</P>
<P>"They are weak tears, for they are u&s;e|le&s;s
ones," replied the Count, drying them,
"I would have you &s;uperior to &s;uch weak|ne&s;s.
The&s;e, however, are only faint traces
of a grief, which, if it had not been
oppo&s;ed by long continued effort, might
have led me to the verge of madne&s;s!
Judge, then, whether I have not cau&s;e to
<PB N="141" REF="143">
warn you of an indulgence, which may pro|duce
&s;o terrible an effect, and which mu&s;t
certainly, if not oppo&s;ed, overcloud the
years, that otherwi&s;e might be happy. M.
Du Pont is a &s;en&s;ible and amiable man, who
has long been tenderly attached to you;
his family and fortune are unexceptionable;&mdash;after
what I have &s;aid, it is unnece&s;&s;ary
to add, that I &s;hould rejoice in your felicity,
and that I think M. Du Pont would pro|mote
it. Do not weep, Emily," continued
the Count, taking her hand, "there is hap|pine&s;s
re&s;erved for you."</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent a moment; and then
added, in a firmer voice, "I do not wi&s;h,
that you &s;hould make a violent effort to
overcome your feelings; all I, at pre&s;ent,
a&s;k, is, that you will check the thoughts,
that would lead you to a remembrance of
the pa&s;t; that you will &s;uffer your mind to be
engaged by pre&s;ent objects; that you will al|low
your&s;elf to believe it po&s;&s;ible you may
yet be happy; and that you will &s;ometimes
think with complacency of poor Du Pont,
<PB N="142" REF="144">
and not condemn him to the &s;tate of de&s;pon|dency,
from which, my dear Emily, I am
endeavouring to withdraw you."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, while
her tears &s;till fell, "do not &s;uffer the bene|volence
of your wi&s;hes to mi&s;lead Mon&s;.Du
Pont with an expectation that I can ever ac|cept
his hand. If I under&s;tand my own
heart, this never can be; your in&s;truction I
can obey in almo&s;t every other particular,
than that of adopting a contrary belief."</P>
<P>"Leave me to under&s;tand your heart,"
replied the Count, with a faint &s;mile. "If
you pay me the compliment to be guided by
my advice in other in&s;tances, I will pardon
your incredulity, re&s;pecting your future con|duct
towards Mon&s;. Du Pont. I will not
even pre&s;s you to remain longer at the cha|teau
than your own &s;atisfaction will permit;
but though I forbear to oppo&s;e your pre&s;ent
retirement, I &s;hall urge the claims of friend|&s;hip
for your future vi&s;its."</P>
<P>Tears of gratitude mingled with tho&s;e of
tender regret, while Emily thanked the
<PB N="143" REF="145">
Count for the many in&s;tances of friend&s;hip
&s;he had received from him; promi&s;ed to
be directed by his advice upon every &s;ub|ject
but one, and a&s;&s;ured him of the plea|&s;ure,
with which &s;he &s;hould, at &s;ome future
period, accept the invitation of the Counte&s;s
and him&s;elf&mdash;if Mon&s;. Du Pont was not at
the chateau.</P>
<P>The Count &s;miled at this condition. "Be
it &s;o," &s;aid he, "meanwhile the convent is
&s;o near the chateau, that my daughter and
I &s;hall often vi&s;it you; and if, &s;ometimes,
we &s;hould dare to bring you another vi&s;itor&mdash;will
you forgive us?"</P>
<P>Emily looked di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and remained
&s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Well," rejoined the Count, "I will
pur&s;ue this &s;ubject no further, and mu&s;t
now entreat your forgivene&s;s for having
pre&s;&s;ed it thus far. You will, however, do
me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I have been
urged only by a &s;incere regard for your hap|pine&s;s,
and that of my amiable friend Mon&s;.
Du Pont."</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
Emily, when &s;he left the Count, went to
mention her intended departure to the Coun|te&s;s,
who oppo&s;ed it with polite expre&s;&s;ions
of regret; after which, &s;he &s;ent a note to
acquaint the lady abbe&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould
return to the convent; and thither &s;he with|drew
on the evening of the following day.
M. Du Pont, in extreme regret, &s;aw her de|part,
while the Count endeavoured to cheer
him with a hope, that Emily would &s;ome|times
regard him with a more favourable
eye.</P>
<P>She was plea&s;ed to find her&s;elf once more
in the tranquil retirement of the convent,
where &s;he experienced a renewal of all the
maternal kindne&s;s of the abbe&s;s, and of the
&s;i&s;terly attentions of the nuns. A report of
the late extraordinary occurrence at the
chateau had already reached them, and, after
&s;upper, on the evening of her arrival, it was
the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation in the convent
parlour, where &s;he was reque&s;ted to men|tion
&s;ome particulars of that unaccountable
event. Emily was guarded in her conver|&s;ation,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
on this &s;ubject, and briefly related a
few circum&s;tances concerning Ludovico,
who&s;e di&s;appearance, her auditors almo&s;t
unanimou&s;ly agreed, had been effected by
&s;upernatural means.</P>
<P>"A belief had &s;o long prevailed," &s;aid a
nun, who was called &s;i&s;ter Frances, "that the
chateau was haunted, that I was &s;urpri&s;ed,
when I heard the Count had the temerity to
inhabit it. Its former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I fear, had
&s;ome deed of con&s;cience to atone for; let us
hope, that the virtues of its pre&s;ent owner
will pre&s;erve him from the puni&s;hment due
to the errors of the la&s;t, if, indeed, he was
criminal."</P>
<P>"Of what crime, then, was he &s;u&s;pected?"
&s;aid a Mademoi&s;elle Feydeau, a boarder at
the convent.</P>
<P>"Let us pray for his &s;oul!" &s;aid a nun,
who had till now &s;at in &s;ilent attention.
"If he was criminal, his puni&s;hment in
this world was &s;ufficient."</P>
<P>There was a mixture of wildne&s;s and &s;o|lemnity
in her manner of delivering this,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
which &s;truck Emily exceedingly; but Ma|demoi&s;elle
repeated her que&s;tion, without
noticing the &s;olemn eagerne&s;s of the nun.</P>
<P>"I dare not pre&s;ume to &s;ay what was his
crime," replied &s;i&s;ter Frances; "but I have
heard many reports of an extraordinary na|ture,
re&s;pecting the late Marquis de Villeroi,
and among others, that, &s;oon after the death
of his lady, he quitted Chateau-le-Blanc,
and never afterwards returned to it. I was
not here at the time, &s;o I can only mention
it from report, and &s;o many years have
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Marchione&s;s died, that few
of our &s;i&s;terhood, I believe, can do more."</P>
<P>"But I can," &s;aid the nun, who had be|fore
&s;poke, and whom they called &s;i&s;ter
Agnes.</P>
<P>"You then," &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle Fey|deau,
"are po&s;&s;ibly acquainted with cir|cum&s;tances,
that enable you to judge, whe|ther
he was criminal or not, and what was
the crime imputed to him."</P>
<P>"I am," replied the nun; "but who
&s;hall dare to &s;crutinize my thoughts&mdash;who
<PB N="147" REF="149">
&s;hall dare to pluck out my opinion? God
only is his judge, and to that judge he is
gone!"</P>
<P>Emily looked with &s;urpri&s;e at &s;i&s;ter
Frances, who returned her a &s;ignificant
glance."</P>
<P>"I only reque&s;ted your opinion," &s;aid
Mademoi&s;elle Feydeau, mildly; "if the
&s;ubject; is di&s;plea&s;ing to you, I will drop it."</P>
<P>"Di&s;plea&s;ing!"&mdash;&s;aid the nun, with em|pha&s;is.&mdash;"We
are idle talkers; we do not
weigh the meaning of the words we u&s;e;
<HI>di&s;plea&s;ing</HI> is a poor word. I will go pray."
As &s;he &s;aid this &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and
with a profound &s;igh quitted the room.</P>
<P>"What can be the meaning of this?"
&s;aid Emily, when &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>"It is nothing extraordinary," replied &s;i&s;ter
Frances, "&s;he is often thus; but &s;he has no
meaning in what &s;he &s;ays. Her intellects
are at times deranged. Did you never &s;ee
her thus before?"</P>
<P>"Never," &s;aid Emily. "I have, indeed,
Sometimes, thought, that there was the me|lancholy
<PB N="148" REF="150">
of madne&s;s in her look, but never
before perceived it in her &s;peech. Poor
&s;oul, I will pray for her!"</P>
<P>"Your prayers then, my daughter, will
unite with burs," ob&s;erved the lady abbe&s;s,
"&s;he has need of them."</P>
<P>"Dear lady," &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle Fey|deau,
addre&s;&s;ing the abbe&s;s, "what is your
opinion of the late Marquis? The &s;trange
circum&s;tances, that have occurred at the
chateau, have &s;o much awakened my curi|o&s;ity,
that I &s;hall be pardoned the que&s;tion.
What was his imputed crime, and what the
puni&s;hment, to which &s;i&s;ter Agnes alluded?"</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t be cautious of advancing our
opinion," &s;aid the abbe&s;s, with an air of
re&s;erve, mingled with &s;olemnity, "we mu&s;t
be cautious of advancing our opinion on &s;o
delicate a &s;ubject. I will not take upon me
to pronounce, that the late Marquis was
criminal, or to &s;ay what was the crime of
which he was &s;u&s;pected; but, concerning
the puni&s;hment our daughter Agnes hinted,
I know of none he &s;uffered. She probably
<PB N="149" REF="151">
alluded to the &s;evere one, which an exa&s;pe|rated
con&s;cience can inflict. Beware, my
children, of incurring &s;o terrible a puni&s;h|ment&mdash;it
is the purgatory of this life!
The late Marchione&s;s I knew well; &s;he was
a pattern to &s;uch as live in the world; nay,
our &s;acred order need not have blu&s;hed to
copy her virtues! Our holy convent re|ceived
her mortal part; her heavenly &s;pirit,
I doubt not, a&s;cended to its &s;anctuary!"</P>
<P>As the abbe&s;s &s;poke this, the la&s;t bell of
ve&s;pers &s;truck up, and &s;he ro&s;e. "Let us
go, my children," &s;aid &s;he, "and intercede
for the wretched; let us go and confe&s;s our
&s;ins, and endeavour to purify our &s;ouls for
the heaven, to which <HI>&s;he</HI> is gone!"</P>
<P>Emily was affected by the &s;olemnity of
this exhortation, and, remembering her fa|ther,
"The heaven, to which <HI>he,</HI> too, is
gone!" &s;aid &s;he, faintly, as &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
her &s;ighs, and followed the abbe&s;s and the
nuns to the chapel.</P>

<P>COUNT DE VILLEFORT, at length, received
a letter from the advocate at Avignon, en|couraging
Emily to a&s;&s;ert her claim to the
e&s;tates of the late Madame Montoni; and,
about the &s;ame time, a me&s;&s;enger arrived
from Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel with intelligence,
that made an appeal to the law on this &s;ub|ject
unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince it appeared, that the
only per&s;on, who could have oppo&s;ed her
claim, was now no more. A friend of M.
Que&s;nel, who re&s;ided at Venice, had &s;ent
him an account of the death of Montoni,
who had been brought to trial with Or&s;ino,
as his &s;uppo&s;ed accomplice in the murder
of the Venetian nobleman. Or&s;ino was
<PB N="151" REF="153">
found guilty, condemned and executed upon
the wheel, but, nothing being di&s;covered to
criminate Montoni, and his colleagues, on
this charge, they were all relea&s;ed, except.
Montoni, who, being con&s;idered by the &s;e|nate
as a very dangerous per&s;on, was, for
other rea&s;ons, ordered again into confine|ment,
where, it was &s;aid, he had died in a
doubtful and my&s;terious manner, and not
without &s;u&s;picion of having been poi&s;oned.
The authority, from which M. Que&s;nel
had received this information, would not al|low
him to doubt its truth, and he told
Emily, that &s;he had now only to lay claim
to the e&s;tates of her late aunt, to &s;ecure
them, and added, that he would him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;t
in the nece&s;&s;ary forms of this bu&s;ine&s;s. The
term, for which La Vall&eacute;e had been let being
now al&s;o nearly expired, he acquainted her
with the circum&s;tance, and advi&s;ed her to
take the road thither, through Tholou&s;e,
where he promi&s;ed to meet her, and where it
would be proper for her to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the e&s;tates, of the late Madame Montoni;
<PB N="152" REF="154">
adding, that he would &s;pare her any diffi|culties,
that might occur on that occa&s;ion
from the want of knowledge on the &s;ubject,
and that he believed it would be nece&s;&s;ary
for her to be at Tholou&s;e, in about three
weeks from the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>An increa&s;e of fortune &s;eemed to have
awakened this &s;udden kindne&s;s in M. Que&s;nel
towards his niece, and it appeared, that he
entertained more re&s;pect for the rich heire&s;s,
than he had ever felt compa&s;&s;ion for the
poor and unfriended orphan.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure, with which &s;he received
this intelligence, was clouded when &s;he con|&s;idered,
that he, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he had once
regretted the want of fortune, was no longer
worthy of &s;haring it with her; but, remem|bering
the friendly admonition of the Count,
&s;he checked this melancholy reflection, and
endeavoured to feel only gratitude for the
unexpected good, that now attended her;
while it formed no incon&s;iderable part of her
&s;atisfaction to know, that La Vall&eacute;e, her na|tive
home, which was endeared to her by it's
<PB N="153" REF="155">
having been the re&s;idence of her parents,
would &s;oon be re&s;tored to her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
There &s;he meant to fix her future re&s;idence,
for, though it could not be compared with
the chateau at Tholou&s;e, either for extent,
or magnificence, its plea&s;ant &s;cenes and the
tender remembrances, that haunted them,
had claims upon her heart, which &s;he was
not inclined to &s;acrifice to o&s;tentation. She
wrote immediately to thank M. Que&s;nel for
the active intere&s;t he took in her concerns,
and to &s;ay, that &s;he would meet him at Tho|lou&s;e
at the appointed time.</P>
<P>When Count de Villefort, with Blanche,
came to the convent to give Emily the ad|vice
of the advocate, he was informed of the
contents of M. Que&s;nel's letter, and gave
her his &s;incere congratulations, on the occa|&s;ion;
but &s;he ob&s;erved, that, when the fir&s;t
expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction had faded from his
countenance, an unu&s;ual gravity &s;ucceeded,
and &s;he &s;carcely he&s;itated to enquire its
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"It has no new occa&s;ion," replied the
<PB N="154" REF="156">
Count; "I am hara&s;&s;ed and perplexed by
the confu&s;ion, into which my family is
thrown by their fooli&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. Idle
reports are floating round me, which I can
neither admit to be true, or prove to be
fal&s;e; and I am, al&s;o, very anxious about
the poor fellow, Ludovico, concerning whom
I have not been able to obtain information.
Every part of the chateau and every part of
the neighbourhood, too, has, I believe, been
&s;earched, and I know not what further can
be done, &s;ince I have already offered large
rewards for the di&s;covery of him. The keys
of the north apartment I have not &s;uffered
to be out of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ince he di&s;ap|peared,
and I mean to watch in tho&s;e
chambers, my&s;elf, this very night."</P>
<P>Emily, &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed for the Count,
united her entreaties with tho&s;e of the Lady
Blanche, to di&s;&s;uade him from his pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>"What &s;hould I fear?" &s;aid he. "I
have no faith in &s;upernatural combats, and
for human oppo&s;ition I &s;hall be prepared;
<PB N="155" REF="157">
nay, I will even promi&s;e not to watch
alone."</P>
<P>"But who, dear &s;ir, will have courage
enough to watch with you?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"My &s;on," replied the Count. "If I
am not carried off in the night," added he,
&s;miling, "you &s;hall hear the re&s;ult of my
adventure, to-morrow."</P>
<P>The Count and Lady Blanche, &s;hortly
afterwards, took leave of Emily, and re|turned
to the chateau, where he informed
Henri of his intention, who, not without
&s;ome &s;ecret reluctance, con&s;ented to be the
partner of his watch; and, when the de&s;ign
was mentioned after &s;upper, the Counte&s;s
was terrified, and the Baron, and M. Du
Pont joined with her in entreating, that
he would not tempt his fate, as Ludo|vico
had done. "We know not," added
the Baron, "the nature, or the power of an
evil &s;pirit; and that &s;uch a &s;pirit haunts tho&s;e
chambers can now, I think, &s;carcely be
doubted. Beware, my lord, how you pro|voke
its vengeance, &s;ince it has already
<PB N="156" REF="158">
given us one terrible example of its malice.
I allow it may be probable, that the &s;pirits
of the dead are permitted to return to the
earth only on occa&s;ions of high import; but
the pre&s;ent import may be your de&s;truc|tion."</P>
<P>The Count could not forbear &s;miling;
"Do you think then, Baron," &s;aid he, "that
my de&s;truction is of &s;ufficient importance to
draw back to earth the &s;oul of the departed?
Alas! my good friend, there is no occa&s;ion
for &s;uch means to accompli&s;h the de&s;truc|tion
of any individual. Wherever the my&s;|tery
re&s;ts, I tru&s;t I &s;hall, this night, be able
to detect it. You know I am not &s;uper&s;ti|tious."</P>
<P>"I know that you are incredulous," in|terrupted
the Baron.</P>
<P>"Well, call it what you will, I meant to
&s;ay, that, though you know I am free from
&s;uper&s;tition&mdash;if any thing &s;upernatural has
appeared, I doubt not it will appear to me,
and if any &s;trange event hangs over my
hou&s;e, or if any extraordinary tran&s;action
<PB N="157" REF="159">
has formerly been connected with it, I &s;hall
probably be made acquainted with it. At
all events I will invite di&s;covery; and, that
I may be equal to a mortal attack, which
in good truth, my friend, is what I mo&s;t ex|pect,
I &s;hall take care to be well armed."</P>
<P>The Count took leave of his family, for
the night, with an a&s;&s;umed gaiety, which but
ill concealed the anxiety, that depre&s;&s;ed his
&s;pirits, and retired to the north apartments,
accompanied by his &s;on and followed by the
Baron, M. Du Pont and &s;ome of the do|me&s;tics,
who all bade him good night at the
outer door. In the&s;e chambers every thing
appeared as when he had la&s;t been here;
even in the bed-room no alteration was vi&s;i|ble,
where he lighted his own fire, for none
of the dome&s;tics could be prevailed upon to
venture thither. After carefully examining
the chamber and the oriel, the Count and
Henri drew their chairs upon the hearth, &s;et
a bottle of wine and a lamp before them, laid
their &s;words upon the table, and, &s;tirring
the wood into a blaze, began to conver&s;e on
<PB N="158" REF="160">
indifferent topics. But Henri was often
&s;ilent and ab&s;tracted, and &s;ometimes threw
a glance of mingled awe and curio&s;ity round
the gloomy apartment; while the Count
gradually cea&s;ed to conver&s;e, and &s;at either
lo&s;t in thought, or reading a volume of Ta|citus,
which he had brought to beguile the
tediou&s;ne&s;s of the night.</P>

<P>THE Baron St. Foix, whom anxiety for
his friend had kept awake, ro&s;e early to en|quire
the event of the night, when, as he
pa&s;&s;ed the Count's clo&s;et, hearing &s;teps
within, he knocked at the door, and it was
opened by his friend him&s;elf. Rejoicing to
&s;ee him in &s;afety, and curious to learn the
occurrences of the night, he had not imme|diately
lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the unu&s;ual gravity,
that over&s;pread the features of the Count,
who&s;e re&s;erved an&s;wers fir&s;t occa&s;ioned him
to notice it. The Count, then &s;miling, en|deavoured
to treat the &s;ubject of his curio|&s;ity
with levity; but the Baron was &s;erious,
and pur&s;ued his enquiries &s;o clo&s;ely, that
the Count, at length, re&s;uming his gravity,
&s;aid, "Well, my friend, pre&s;s the &s;ubject
no further, I entreat you; and let me re|que&s;t
<PB N="160" REF="162">
al&s;o, that you will hereafter be &s;ilent
upon any thing you may think extraordi|nary
in my future conduct. I do not &s;cru|ple
to tell you, that I am unhappy, and that
the watch of the la&s;t night has not a&s;&s;i&s;ted
me to di&s;cover Ludovico; upon every oc|currence
of the night you mu&s;t excu&s;e my
re&s;erve."</P>
<P>"But where&punc; is Henri?" &s;aid the Baron,
with &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appointment at this
denial.</P>
<P>"He is well in his own apartment," re|plied
the Count. "You will not que&s;tion
him on this topic, my friend, &s;ince you know
my wi&s;h."</P>
<P>"Certainly not," &s;aid the Baron, &s;ome|what
chagrined, "&s;ince it would be di&s;plea&s;|ing
to you; but methinks, my friend, you
might rely on my di&s;cretion, and drop this
unu&s;ual re&s;erve. However, you mu&s;t allow
me to &s;u&s;pect, that you have &s;een rea|&s;on
to become a convert to my &s;y&s;tem, and
are no longer the incredulous knight you
lately appeared to be."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">
"Let us talk no more upon this &s;ub|ject,"
&s;aid the Count; "you may be a&s;|&s;ured,
that no ordinary circum&s;tance has
impo&s;ed this &s;ilence upon me towards a
friend, whom I have called &s;o for near thirty
years; and my pre&s;ent re&s;erve cannot make
you que&s;tion either my e&s;teem, or the &s;in|cerity
of my friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"I will not doubt either," &s;aid the Baron,
"though you mu&s;t allow me to expre&s;s my
&s;urpri&s;e, at this &s;ilence."</P>
<P>"To me I will allow it," replied the
Count, "but I earne&s;tly entreat that you
will forbear to notice it to my family, as
well as every thing remarkable you may
ob&s;erve in my conduct towards them."</P>
<P>The Baron readily promi&s;ed this, and,
after conver&s;ing for &s;ome time on general
topics, they de&s;cended to the breakfa&s;t|room,
where the Count met his family with
a cheerful countenance, and evaded their
enquiries by employing light ridicule, and
a&s;&s;uming an air of uncommon gaiety, while
he a&s;&s;ured them, that they need not appre|hend
<PB N="162" REF="164">
any evil from the north chambers,
&s;ince Henri and him&s;elf had been permit|ted
to return from them in &s;afety.</P>
<P>Henri, however, was le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in di&s;|gui&s;ing
his feelings. From his counte|nance
an expre&s;&s;ion of terror was not entire|ly
faded; he was often &s;ilent and thought|ful,
and, when he attempted to laugh at the
eager enquiries of mademoi&s;elle Bearn, it
was evidently only an attempt.</P>
<P>In the evening, the Count called, as he
had promi&s;ed, at the convent, and Emily
was &s;urprifed to perceive a mixture of play|ful
ridicule and of re&s;erve in his mention
of the north apartment. Of what had oc|curred
there, however, he &s;aid nothing, and,
when &s;he ventured to remind him of his
promi&s;e to tell her the re&s;ult of his enqui|ries,
and to a&s;k if he had received any
proof, that tho&s;e chambers were haunted, his
look became &s;olemn, for a moment, then,
&s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he &s;miled, and
&s;aid, "My dear Emily, do not &s;uffer my
lady abbe&s;s to infect your good under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="163" REF="165">
with the&s;e fancies; &s;he will teach you
to expect a gho&s;t in every dark room. But
believe me," added he, with a profound
&s;igh, "the apparition of the dead comes
not on light, or &s;portive errands, to terrify,
or to &s;urpri&s;e the timid." He pau&s;ed, and
fell into a momentary thoughtfulne&s;s, and
then added, "We will &s;ay no more on this
&s;ubject."</P>
<P>Soon after, he took leave, and, when
Emily joined &s;ome of the nuns, &s;he was
&s;urpri&s;ed to find them acquainted with a
circum&s;tance, which &s;he had carefully
avoided to mention, and expre&s;&s;ing their
admiration of his intrepidity in having dar|ed
to pa&s;s a night in the apartment, whence
Ludovico had di&s;appeared; for &s;he had not
con&s;idered with what rapidity a tale of
wonder circulates. The nuns had acqui|red
their information from pea&s;ants, who
brought fruit to the mona&s;tery, and who&s;e
whole attention had been fixed, &s;ince the
di&s;appearance of Ludovico, on what was
pa&s;&s;ing in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">
Emily li&s;tened in &s;ilence to the various
opinions of the nuns, concerning the con|duct
of the Count, mo&s;t of whom condemn|ed
it as ra&s;h and pre&s;umptuous, affirming,
that it was provoking the vengeance of an
evil &s;pirit, thus to intrude upon its haunts.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Frances contended, that the Count
had acted with the bravery of a virtuous
mind. He knew him&s;elf guiltle&s;s of aught,
that &s;hould provoke a good &s;pirit, and did
not fear the &s;pells of an evil one, &s;ince he
could claim the protection of an higher
Power, of Him, who can command the
wicked, and will protect the innocent.</P>
<P>"The guilty cannot claim that protec|tion!"
&s;aid &s;i&s;ter Agnes, "let the Count
look to his conduct, that he do not forfeit
his claim! Yet who is he, that &s;hall dare
to call him&s;elf innocent!&mdash;all earthly inno|cence
is but comparative. Yet &s;till how
wide a&s;under are the extremes of guilt, and
to what an horrible depth may we fall!
Oh!"&mdash;</P>
<P>The nun, as &s;he concluded, uttered a
<PB N="165" REF="167">
&s;huddering &s;igh, that &s;tartled Emily, Who,
looking up, perceived the eyes of Agnes
fixed on hers; after which the &s;i&s;ter ro&s;e,
took her hand, gazed earne&s;tly upon her
countenance, for &s;ome moments, in &s;ilence,
and then &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You are young&mdash;you are innocent!
I mean you are yet innocent of any great
crime!&mdash;But you have pa&s;&s;ions in your
heart,&mdash;&s;corpions; they &s;leep now&mdash;be|ware
how you awaken them!&mdash;they will
&s;ting you, even unto death!"</P>
<P>Emily, affected by the&s;e words and by
the &s;olemnity, with which they were de|livered,
could not &s;uppre&s;s her tears.</P>
<P>"Ah! is it &s;o?" exclaimed Agnes, her
countenance &s;oftening from its &s;ternne&s;s&mdash;"&s;o
young, and &s;o unfortunate! We are
&s;i&s;ters, then indeed. Yet, there is no bond
of kindne&s;s among the guilty," &s;he added,
while her eyes re&s;umed their wild expre&s;|&s;ion,
"no gentlene&s;s,&mdash;no peace, no hope!
I knew them all once&mdash;my eyes could
weep&mdash;but now they burn, for now, my
<PB N="166" REF="168">
&s;oul is fixed, and fearle&s;s!&mdash;I lament no
more!"</P>
<P>"Rather let us repent, and pray," &s;aid
another nun. "We are taught to hope,
that prayer and penitence will work our
&s;alvation. There is hope for all who re|pent!"</P>
<P>"Who repent and turn to the true
faith," ob&s;erved &s;i&s;ter Frances.</P>
<P>"For all but me!" replied Agnes &s;o|lemnly,
who pau&s;ed, and then abruptly
added, "My head burns, I believe I am
not well. O! could I &s;trike from my me|mory
all former &s;cenes&mdash;the figures, that
ri&s;e up, like furies, to torment me!&mdash;I &s;ee
them, when I &s;leep, and, when I am awake,
they are &s;till before my eyes! I &s;ee them
now&mdash;now!</P>
<P>She &s;tood, in a fixed attitude of horror,
her &s;training eyes moving &s;lowly round the
room, as if they followed &s;omething. One
of the huns gently took her hand, to lead
her from the parlour. Agnes became calm,
drew her other hand acro&s;s her eyes, look|ed
<PB N="167" REF="169">
again, and, &s;ighing deeply, &s;aid, "They
are gone&mdash;they are gone! I am feveri&s;h, I
know not what I &s;ay. I am thus, &s;ome|times,
but it will go off again, I &s;hall &s;oon
be better. Was not that the ve&s;per|bell?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Frances, "the evening
&s;ervice is pa&s;&s;ed. Let Margaret lead you
to your cell."</P>
<P>"You are right," replied &s;i&s;ter Agnes,
"I &s;hall be better there. Good night, my
&s;i&s;ters, remember me in your ori&s;ons!"</P>
<P>When they had withdrawn, Frances, ob|&s;erving
Emily's emotion, &s;aid, "Do not be
alarmed, our &s;i&s;ter is often thus deranged,
though I have not lately &s;een her &s;o fran|tic;
her u&s;ual mood is melancholy. This
fit has been coming on, for &s;everal days;
&s;eclu&s;ion and the cu&s;tomary treatment will
re&s;tore her."</P>
<P>"But how rationally she conver&s;ed, at
fir&s;t!" ob&s;erved Emily," "her ideas fol|lowed
each other in perfect order."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied the nun, "this is no|thing
<PB N="168" REF="170">
new; nay, I have &s;ometimes known
her argue not only with method, but with
acutene&s;s, and then, in a moment, &s;tart off
into madne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Her con&s;cience &s;eems afflicted," &s;aid
Emily, "did you ever hear what circum|&s;tance
reduced her to this deplorable con|dition?"</P>
<P>"I have," replied the nun, who &s;aid no
more till Emily repeated the que&s;tion, when
&s;he added in a low voice, and looking &s;ig|nificantly
towards the other boarders, "I
cannot tell you now, but, if you think it
worth your while, come to my cell, to-night,
when our &s;i&s;terhood are at re&s;t, and you
&s;hall hear more; but remember we ri&s;e to
midnight prayers, and come either before,
or after midnight."</P>
<P>Emily promi&s;ed to remember, and, the
abbe&s;s &s;oon after appearing, they &s;poke no
more of the unhappy nun.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, on his return
home, had found M. Du Pont in one of
tho&s;e fits of de&s;pondency, which his attach|ment
<PB N="169" REF="171">
to Emily frequently occa&s;ioned him,
an attachment, that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted too long
to be ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, and which had already
outlived the oppo&s;ition of his friends. M.
Du Pont had fir&s;t &s;een Emily in Ga&s;cony,
during the lifetime of his parent, who, on
di&s;covering his &s;on's partiality for mademoi|&s;elle
St. Aubert, his inferior in point of for|tune,
forbade him to declare it to her fa|mily,
or to think of her more. During the
life of his father, he had ob&s;erved the fir&s;t
command, but had found it impracticable
to obey the &s;econd, and had, &s;ometimes,
&s;oothed his pa&s;&s;ion by vi&s;iting her favourite
haunts, among which was the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e,
where, once or twice, he addre&s;&s;ed her in
ver&s;e, concealing his name, in obedience to
the promi&s;e he had given his father. There
too he played the pathetic air, to which &s;he
had li&s;tened with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;e and admira|tion;
and there he found the miniature, that
had &s;ince cheri&s;hed a pa&s;&s;ion fatal to his re|po&s;e.
During his expedition into Italy, his
<PB N="170" REF="172">
father died; but he received his liberty at a
moment, when he was the lea&s;t enabled to
profit by it, &s;ince the object, that rendered
it mo&s;t valuable, was no longer within the
reach of his vows. By what accident he
di&s;covered Emily, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to relea&s;e her
from a terrible impri&s;onment, has already ap|peared,
and al&s;o the unavailing hope, with
which he then encouraged his love, and the
fruitle&s;s efforts, that he had &s;ince made to
overcome it.</P>
<P>The Count &s;till endeavoured, with friend|ly
zeal, to &s;ooth him with a belief, that pa|tience,
per&s;everance and prudence would
finally obtain for him happine&s;s and Emi|ly;
"Time," &s;aid he, "will wear away
the melancholy impre&s;&s;ion, which di&s;ap|pointment
has left on her mind, and &s;he
will be &s;en&s;ible of your merit. Your &s;er|vices
have already awakened her gratitude,
and your &s;ufferings her pity; and tru&s;t me,
my friend, in a heart &s;o &s;en&s;ible as hers,
gratitude and pity lead to love. When her
<PB N="171" REF="173">
imagination is re&s;cued from its pre&s;ent de|lu&s;ion,
&s;he will readily accept the homage
of a mind like yours."</P>
<P>Du Pont &s;ighed, while he li&s;tened to the&s;e
words; and, endeavouring to hope what his
friend believed, he willingly yielded to an
invitation to prolong his vi&s;it at the cha|teau,
which we now leave for the mona&s;tery
of St. Claire.</P>
<P>When the nuns had retired to re&s;t, Emily
&s;tole to her appointment with &s;i&s;ter Frances,
whom &s;he found in her cell, engaged in
prayer, before a little table, where appeared
the image &s;he was addre&s;&s;ing, and, above,
the dim lamp, that gave light to the place.
Turning her eyes, as the door opened, &s;he
beckoned to Emily to come in, who, having
done &s;o, &s;eated her&s;elf in &s;ilence be&s;ide the
nun's little mattre&s;s of &s;traw, till her ori&s;ons
&s;hould conclude. The latter &s;oon ro&s;e from
her knees, and, taking down the lamp and
placing it on the table, Emily perceived there
a human &s;cull and bones, lying be&s;ide an
hour-gla&s;s; but the nun, without ob&s;erving
<PB N="172" REF="174">
her emotion, &s;at down on the mattre&s;s by
her, &s;aying, "Your curio&s;ity, &s;i&s;ter, has
made you punctual, but you have nothing
remarkable to hear in the hi&s;tory of poor
Agnes, of whom I avoided to &s;peak in the
pre&s;ence of my lay-&s;i&s;ters, only becau&s;e I
would not publi&s;h her crime to them."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall con&s;ider your confidence in me
as a favour," &s;aid Emily, "and will not
mi&s;u&s;e it."</P>
<P>"Si&s;ter Agnes," re&s;umed the nun, "is
of a noble family, as the dignity of her air
mu&s;t already have informed you, but I will
not di&s;honour their name &s;o much as to re|veal
it. Love was the occa&s;ion of her crime
and of her madne&s;s. She was beloved by a
gentleman of inferior fortune, and her fa|ther,
as I have heard, be&s;towing her on a
nobleman, whom &s;he di&s;liked, an ill-go|verned
pa&s;&s;ion proved her de&s;truction.&mdash;Every
obligation of virtue and of duty was
forgotten, and &s;he prophaned her marriage
vows; but her guilt was &s;oon detected, and
&s;he would have fallen a &s;acrifice to the ven|geance
<PB N="173" REF="175">
of her hu&s;band, had not her father
contrived to convey her from his power. By
what means he did this, I never could learn;
but he &s;ecreted her in this convent, where he
afterwards prevailed with her to take the
veil, while a report was circulated in the
world, that &s;he was dead, and the father, to
&s;ave his daughter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the rumour, and
employed &s;uch means as induced her hu&s;|band
to believe &s;he had become a victim to
his jealou&s;y. You look &s;urpri&s;ed," added
the nun, ob&s;erving Emily's countenance;
"I allow the &s;tory is uncommon, but not, I
believe, without a parallel."</P>
<P>"Pray proceed," &s;aid Emily, "I am in|tere&s;ted."</P>
<P>"The &s;tory is already told," re&s;umed the
nun, "I have only to mention that the
long &s;truggle, which Agnes &s;uffered, between
love, remor&s;e and a &s;en&s;e of the duties &s;he
had taken upon her&s;elf in becoming of our
order, at length un&s;ettled her rea&s;on. At fir&s;t,
&s;he was frantic and melancholy by quick al|ternatives;
then, &s;he &s;unk into a deep and
<PB N="174" REF="176">
&s;ettled melancholy, which &s;till, however,
has, at times, been interrupted by fits of
wildne&s;s, and, of late, the&s;e have again been
frequent."</P>
<P>Emily was affected by the hi&s;tory of the
&s;i&s;ter, &s;ome parts of who&s;e &s;tory brought to
her remembrance that of the Marchione&s;s
de Villeroi, who had al&s;o been compelled by
her father to for&s;ake the object of her affec|tions,
for a nobleman of his choice; but, from
what Doroth&eacute;e had related, there appeared
no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he had e&s;caped
the vengeance of a jealous hu&s;band, or to
doubt for a moment the innocence of her
conduct. But Emily, while &s;he &s;ighed over
the mi&s;ery of the nun, could not forbear
&s;hedding a few tears to the misfortunes of
the Marchione&s;s; and, when &s;he returned to
the mention of &s;i&s;ter Agnes, &s;he a&s;ked Fran|ces
if &s;he remembered her in her youth, and
whether &s;he was then beautiful.</P>
<P>"I was not here at the time, when &s;he
took the vows," replied Frances, "which is
&s;o long ago, that few of the pre&s;ent &s;i&s;ter|hood,
<PB N="175" REF="177">
I believe, were witne&s;&s;es of the cere|mony;
nay, even our lady mother did not
then pre&s;ide over the convent: but I can re|member,
when &s;i&s;ter Agnes was a very beau|tiful
woman. She retains that air of high
rank, which always di&s;tingui&s;hed her, but
her beauty, you mu&s;t perceive, is fled; I
can &s;carcely di&s;cover even a ve&s;tige of the
loveline&s;s, that once animated her features."</P>
<P>"It is &s;trange," &s;aid Emily, "but there
are moments, when her countenance has ap|peared
familiar to my memory! You will
think me-fanciful, and I think my&s;elf &s;o, for
I certainly never &s;aw &s;i&s;ter Agnes, before I
came to this convent, and I mu&s;t, therefore,
have &s;een &s;ome per&s;on, whom &s;he &s;trongly
re&s;embles, though of this I have no recol|lection."</P>
<P>"You have been intere&s;ted by the deep
melancholy of her countenance," &s;aid Fran|ces,
"and its impre&s;&s;ion has probably de|luded
your imagination; for I might as rea|&s;onably
think I perceive a likene&s;s between
you and Agnes, as you, that you have &s;een
<PB N="176" REF="178">
her any where but in this convent, &s;ince this
has been her place of refuge, for nearly as
many years as make your age."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes," rejoined Frances, "and why
does that circum&s;tance excite your &s;ur|pri&s;e?"</P>
<P>Emily did not appear to notice this que&s;|tion,
but remained thoughtful, for a few
moments, and then &s;aid, "It was about that
&s;ame period that the Marchione&s;s de Ville|roi
expired."</P>
<P>"That is an odd remark," &s;aid Frances.</P>
<P>Emily, recalled from her reverie, &s;miled,
and gave the conver&s;ation another turn, but
it &s;oon came back to the &s;ubject of the un|happy
nun, and Emily remained in the cell
of &s;i&s;ter Frances, till the mid-night bell
arou&s;ed her; when, apologizing for having
interrupted the &s;i&s;ter's repo&s;e, till this late
hour, they quitted the cell together. Emily
returned to her chamber, and the nun,
bearing a glimmering taper, went to her de|votion
in the-chapel.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">
Several days followed, during which Emi|ly
&s;aw neither the Count, or any of his fa|mily;
and, when, at length, he appeared,
&s;he remarked, with concern, that his air was
unu&s;ually di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>"My &s;pirits are hara&s;&s;ed," &s;aid he, in
an&s;wer to her anxious enquiries, "and I
mean to change my re&s;idence, for a little
while, an experiment, which, I hope, will
re&s;tore my mind to its u&s;ual tranquillity.
My daughter and my&s;elf will accompany
the Baron St. Foix to his chateau. It lies
in a valley of the Pyren&eacute;es, that opens to|wards
Ga&s;cony, and I have been thinking,
Emily, that, when you &s;et out for La Val|l&eacute;e,
we may go part of the way together; it
would be a &s;atisfaction to me to guard you
towards your home.</P>
<P>She thanked the Count for his friendly
con&s;ideration, and lamented, that the nece&s;|&s;ity
for her going fir&s;t to Tholou&s;e would
render this plan impracticable, "But, when
you are at the Baron's re&s;idence," &s;he added,
"you will be only a &s;hort journey from La
<PB N="178" REF="180">
Vall&eacute;e, and I think, &s;ir, you will not leave
the country without vi&s;iting me; it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;ay with what plea&s;ure I &s;hould
receive you and the Lady Blanche."</P>
<P>"I do not doubt it," replied the Count,
"and I will not deny my&s;elf and Blanche
the plea&s;ure of vi&s;iting you, if your affairs
&s;hould allow you to be at La Vall&eacute;e, about
the time when we can meet you there."</P>
<P>When Emily &s;aid that &s;he &s;hould hope to
&s;ee the Counte&s;s al&s;o, &s;he was not &s;orry to
learn that this lady was going, accompanied
by Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, to pay a vi&s;it, for a
few weeks, to a family in lower Languedoc.</P>
<P>The Count, after &s;ome further conver&s;a|tion
on his intended journey and on the
arrangement of Emily's, took leave; and
many days did not &s;ucceed this vi&s;it, before
a &s;econd letter from M. Que&s;nel informed
her, that he was then at Tholou&s;e, that La
Vall&eacute;e was at liberty, and that he wi&s;hed
her to &s;et off for the former place, where he
awaited her arrival, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch,
&s;ince his own affairs pre&s;&s;ed him to
<PB N="179" REF="181">
return to Ga&s;cony. Emily did not he&s;itate
to obey him, and, having taken an affecting
leave of the Count's family, in which M.
Du Pont was &s;till included, and of her
friends at the convent, &s;he &s;et out for Tho|lou&s;e,
attended by the unhappy Annette,
and guarded by a &s;teady &s;ervant of the
Count.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Lull'd in the countle&s;s chambers of the brain,</L>

<BIBL>PLEASURES OF MEMORY.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY pur&s;ued her journey, without
any accident, along the plains of Langue|doc
towards the north-we&s;t; and, on this
her return to Tholou&s;e, which &s;he had la&s;t
left with Madame Montoni, &s;he thought
much on the melancholy fate of her aunt,
who, but for her own imprudence, might now
have been living in happine&s;s there! Mon|toni,
too, often ro&s;e to her fancy, &s;uch as
&s;he had &s;een him in his days of triumph,
bold, &s;pirited and commanding; &s;uch al&s;o
as &s;he had &s;ince beheld him in his days of
vengeance; and now, only a few &s;hort
months had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;and he had no longer
the power, or the will to afflict;&mdash;he had become
<PB N="181" REF="183">
come a clod of earth, and his life was va|ni&s;hed
like a &s;hadow! Emily could have
wept at his fate, had &s;he not remembered
his crimes; for that of her unfortunate aunt
&s;he did weep, and all &s;en&s;e of her errors was
overcome by the recollection of her misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>Other thoughts and other emotions &s;uc|ceeded,
as Emily drew near the well-known
&s;cenes of her early love, and con&s;idered, that
Valancourt was lo&s;t to her and to him&s;elf,
for ever. At length, &s;he came to the brow
of the hill, whence, on her departure for
Italy, &s;he had given a farewell look to this
beloved land&s;cape, among&s;t who&s;e woods and
fields &s;he had &s;o often walked with Valan|court,
and where he was then to inhabit,
when &s;he would be far, far away! She &s;aw,
once more, that chain of the Pyren&eacute;es, which
overlooked La Vall&eacute;e, ri&s;ing, like faint
clouds, on the horizon. "There, too, is
Ga&s;cony, extended at their feet!" &s;aid &s;he,
"O my father,&mdash;my mother! And there,
too, is the Garonne!" &s;he added, drying
<PB N="182" REF="184">
the tears, that ob&s;cured her &s;ight,&mdash;" and
Tholou&s;e, and my aunt's man&s;ion&mdash;and the
groves in her garden!&mdash;O my friends! are
ye all lo&s;t to me&mdash;mu&s;t I never, never &s;ee
ye more!" Tears ru&s;hed again to her eyes,
and. &s;he continued to weep, till an abrupt
turn in the road had nearly occa&s;ioned the
carriage to over&s;et, when, looking up, &s;he
perceived another part of the well-known
&s;cene around Tholou&s;e, and all the reflec|tions
and anticipations, which &s;he had &s;uf|fered,
at the moment, when &s;he bade it la&s;t
adieu, came with recollected force to her
heart. She remembered how anxiou&s;ly &s;he
had looked forward to the futurity, which
was to decide her happine&s;s concerning Va|lancourt,
and what depre&s;&s;ing fears had a&s;|&s;ailed
her; the very words &s;he had uttered,
as &s;he withdrew her la&s;t look from the pro|&s;pect,
came to her memory. "Could I but
be certain," &s;he had then &s;aid, "that I
&s;hould ever return, and that Valancourt
would &s;till live for me&mdash;I &s;hould go in
peace!"</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185">
Now, that futurity, &s;o anxiou&s;ly antici|pated,
was arrived, &s;he was returned&mdash;but
what a dreary blank appeared!&mdash;Valancourt
no longer lived for her! She had no longer
even the melancholy &s;atisfaction of contem|plating
his image in her heart, for he was
no longer the &s;ame Valancourt &s;he had
cheri&s;hed there&mdash;the &s;olace of many a mourn|ful
hour, the animating friend, that had en|abled
her to bear up again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion
of Montoni&mdash;the di&s;tant hope, that had
beamed over her gloomy pro&s;pect! On per|ceiving
this beloved idea to be an illu&s;ion of
her own creation, Valancourt &s;eemed to be
annihilated, and her &s;oul &s;ickened at the
blank, that remained. His marriage with
a rival, even his death, &s;he thought &s;he
could have endured with more fortitude,
than this di&s;covery; for then, amid&s;t all her
grief, &s;he could have looked in &s;ecret upon
the image of goodne&s;s, which her fancy had
drawn of him, and comfort would have
mingled with her &s;uffering!</P>
<P>Drying her tears, &s;he looked, once more,
<PB N="184" REF="186">
upon the land&s;cape, which had excited them,
and perceived, that &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing the very
bank, where &s;he had taken leave of Valan|court,
on the morning of her departure from
Tholou&s;e, and &s;he now &s;aw him, through her
returning tears, &s;uch as he had appeared,
when &s;he looked from the carriage to give
him a la&s;t adieu&mdash;&s;aw him leaning mourn|fully
again&s;t the high trees, and remembered
the fixed look of mingled tenderne&s;s and
angui&s;h, with which he had then regarded
her. This recollection was too much for
her heart, and &s;he &s;unk back in the carriage,
nor once looked up, till it &s;topped at the
gates of what was now her own man&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e being opened, and by the &s;ervant,
to who&s;e care the chateau had been entru&s;t|ed,
the carriage drove into the court, where,
alighting, &s;he ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed through the great
hall, now &s;ilent and &s;olitary, to a large oak
parlour, the common &s;itting room of the late
Madame Montoni, where, in&s;tead of being
received by M. Que&s;nel, &s;he found a letter
from him, informing her, that bu&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="185" REF="187">
con&s;equence had obliged him to leave Tho|lou&s;e
two days before. Emily was, upon
the whole, not &s;orry to be &s;pared his pre|&s;ence,
&s;ince his abrupt departure appeared
to indicate the &s;ame indifference, with which
he had formerly regarded her. This letter
informed her, al&s;o, of the progre&s;s he had
made in the &s;ettlement of her affairs, and
concluded with directions, concerning the
forms of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which remained for
her to tran&s;act. But M. Que&s;nel's unkind|ne&s;s
did not long occupy her thoughts,
which returned to the remembrance of the
per&s;ons &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee in this
man&s;ion, and chiefly of the ill-guided and un|fortunate
Madame Montoni. In the room,
where &s;he now &s;at, &s;he had breakfa&s;ted with
her on the morning of their departure for
Italy; and the view of it brought mo&s;t for|cibly
to her recollection all &s;he had her&s;elf
&s;uffered, at that time, and the many gay ex|pectations,
which her aunt had formed, re|&s;pecting
the journey before her. While
Emily's mind was thus engaged, her eyes
<PB N="186" REF="188">
wandered uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to a large window,
that looked upon the garden, and here new
memorials of the pa&s;t &s;poke to her heart,
for &s;he &s;aw extended before her the very
avenue, in which &s;he had parted with Va|lancourt,
on the eve of her journey; and all
the anxiety, the tender intere&s;t he had &s;hewn,
concerning her future happine&s;s, his earne&s;t
remon&s;trances again&s;t her committing her|&s;elf
to the power of Montoni, and the truth
of his affection, came afre&s;h to her memory.
At this moment, it appeared almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble,
that Valancourt could have become un|worthy
of her regard, and &s;he doubted all that
&s;he had lately heard to his di&s;advantage, and
even his own words, which had confirmed
Count De Villefort's report of him. Over|come
by the recollections, which the view of
this avenue occa&s;ioned, &s;he turned abruptly
from the window, and &s;unk into a chair be|&s;ide
it, where &s;he &s;at, given up to grief, till
the entrance of Annette, with coffee, arou&s;ed
her.</P>
<P>"Dear madam, how melancholy this place
<PB N="187" REF="189">
looks now," &s;aid Annette, "to what it u&s;ed
to do! It is di&s;mal coming home, when
there is nobody to welcome one!"</P>
<P>This was not the moment, in which
Emily could bear the remark; her tears fell
again, and, as &s;oon as &s;he had taken the
coffee, &s;he retired to her apartment, where
&s;he endeavoured to repo&s;e. her fatigued &s;pi|rits.
But bu&s;y memory would &s;till &s;upply
her with the vi&s;ions of former times: &s;he
&s;aw Valancourt intere&s;ting and benevolent,
as he had been wont to appear in the days
of their early love, and, amid&s;t the &s;cenes,
where &s;he had believed that they &s;hould
&s;ometimes pa&s;s their years together!&mdash;but,
at length, &s;leep clo&s;ed the&s;e afflicting &s;cenes
from her view.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;erious occu|pation
recovered her from &s;uch melancholy
reflections; for, being de&s;irous of quitting
Tholou&s;e, and of ha&s;tening on to La Val|lee,
&s;he made &s;ome enquiries into the condi|tion
of the e&s;tate, and immediately di&s;|patched
a part of the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="188" REF="190">
concerning it, according to the directions of
Mon&s;. Que&s;nel. It required a &s;trong effort
to ab&s;tract her thoughts from other intere&s;ts
&s;ufficiently to attend to this, but &s;he was re|warded
for her exertions by again experi|encing,
that employment is the &s;ure&s;t anti|dote
to &s;orrow.</P>
<P>This day was devoted entirely to bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
and, among other concerns, &s;he em|ployed
means to learn the &s;ituation of all
her poor tenants, that &s;he might relieve
their wants, or confirm their comforts.</P>
<P>In the evening, her &s;pirits were &s;o much
&s;trengthened, that &s;he thought &s;he could
bear to vi&s;it the gardens, where &s;he had &s;o
often walked with Valancourt; and, know|ing,
that, if &s;he delayed to do &s;o, their
&s;cenes would only affect her the more,
whenever they &s;hould be viewed, &s;he took
advantage of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her mind,
and entered them.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing ha&s;tily the gate leading from the
court into the gardens, &s;he hurried up the
great avenue, &s;carcely permitting her me|mory
<PB N="189" REF="191">
to dwell for a moment on the circum|&s;tance
of her having here parted with Valan|court,
and &s;oon quitted this for other walks
le&s;s intere&s;ting to her heart. The&s;e brought
her, at length, to the flight of &s;teps, that led
from the lower garden to the terrace, on
&s;eeing which, &s;he became agitated, and he&s;i|tated
whether to a&s;cend, but, her re&s;olution
returning, &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Emily, as &s;he a&s;cended,
"the&s;e are the &s;ame high trees, that u&s;ed to
wave over the terrace, and the&s;e the &s;ame
flowery thickets&mdash;the liburnum, the wild
ro&s;e, and the cerinthe&mdash;which were wont to
grow beneath them! Ah! and there, too,
on that bank, are the very plants, which
Valancourt &s;o carefully reared!&mdash;O when
la&s;t I &s;aw them!"&mdash;She checked the thought,
but could not re&s;train her tears, and, after
walking &s;lowly on for a few moments, her
agitation, upon the view of this well-known
&s;cene, increa&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he was obliged
to &s;top, and lean upon the wall of the ter|race.
It was a mild, and beautiful evening.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
The &s;un was &s;etting over the exten&s;ive land|&s;cape,
to which his beams, &s;loping from be|neath
a dark cloud, that overhung the
we&s;t, gave rich and partial colouring, and
touched the tufted &s;ummits of the groves,
that ro&s;e from the garden below, with a
yellow gleam. Emily and Valancourt had
often admired together this &s;cene, at the
&s;ame hour; and it was exactly on this &s;pot,
that, on the night preceding her departure
for Italy, &s;he had li&s;tened to his remon|&s;trances
again&s;t the journey, and to the
pleadings of pa&s;&s;ionate affection. Some ob|&s;ervations,
which &s;he made on the land&s;cape,
brought this to her remembrance, and with
it all the minute particulars of that conver|&s;ation;&mdash;the
alarming doubts he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
concerning Montoni, doubts, which
had &s;ince been fatally confirmed; the rea|&s;ons
and entreaties he had employed to pre|vail
with her to con&s;ent to an immediate
marriage; the tenderne&s;s of his love, the
paroxy&s;ms of his grief, and the conviction
he had repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed, that they &s;hould
<PB N="191" REF="193">
never meet again in happine&s;s! All the&s;e
circum&s;tances ro&s;e afre&s;h to her mind, and
awakened the various emotions &s;he had then
&s;uffered. Her tenderne&s;s for Valancourt
became as powerful as in the moments,
when &s;he thought, that &s;he was parting with
him and happine&s;s together, and when the
&s;trength of her mind had enabled her to
triumph over pre&s;ent &s;uffering, rather than
to de&s;erve the reproach of her con&s;cience
by engaging in a clande&s;tine marriage.&mdash;"Alas!"
&s;aid Emily, as the&s;e recol|lections
came to her mind, "and what
have I gained by the fortitude I then prac|ti&s;ed?&mdash;am
I happy now?&mdash;He &s;aid, we
&s;hould meet no more in happine&s;s; but, O!
he little thought his own mi&s;conduct would
&s;eparate us, and lead to the very evil he
then dreaded!"</P>
<P>Her reflections increa&s;ed her angui&s;h,
while &s;he was compelled to acknowledge,
that the fortitude &s;he had formerly exerted,
if it had not conducted her to happine&s;s,
had &s;aved her from irretrievable misfortune
<PB N="192" REF="194">
&mdash;from Valancourt him&s;elf! But in the&s;e
moments &s;he could not congratulate her&s;elf
on the prudence, that had &s;aved her: &s;he
could only lament, with bittere&s;t angui&s;h,
the circum&s;tances, which had con&s;pired to
betray Valancourt into a cour&s;e of life &s;o
different from that, which the virtues, the
ta&s;te, and the pur&s;uits of his early years
had promi&s;ed; but &s;he &s;till loved him too
well to believe, that his heart was even now
depraved, though his conduct had been cri|minal.
An ob&s;ervation, which had fallen
from M. St. Aubert more than once, now
occurred to her. "This young man,"
&s;aid he, &s;peaking of Valancourt, "has ne|ver
been at Paris;" a remark, that had &s;ur|pri&s;ed
her at the time it was uttered, but
which me now under&s;tood, and &s;he ex|claimed
&s;orrowfully, "O Valancourt! if
&s;uch a friend, as my father had been with
you at Paris&mdash;your noble, ingenuous na|ture
would not have fallen,!".</P>
<P>The &s;un was now &s;et, and, recalling her
thoughts from their melancholy &s;ubject, &s;he
<PB N="193" REF="195">
continued her walk; for the pen&s;ive &s;hade
of twilight was plea&s;ing to her, and the
nightingales from the &s;urrounding groves
began to an&s;wer each other in the long|drawn,
plaintive note, which always touched
her heart; while all the fragrance of the
flowery thickets, that bounded the terrace,
was awakened by the cool evening air,
which floated &s;o lightly among their leaves,
that they &s;carcely trembled as it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Emily came, at length, to the &s;teps of
the pavilion, that terminated the terrace,
and where her la&s;t interview with Valan|court,
before her departure from Tholou&s;e,
had &s;o unexpectedly taken place. The
door was now &s;hut, and she trembled, while
&s;he he&s;itated whether to open it; but her
wi&s;h to &s;ee again a place, which had been
the chief &s;cene of her former happine&s;s, at
length overcoming her reluctance to en|counter
the painful regret it would renew,
&s;he entered. The room was ob&s;cured by a
melancholy &s;hade; but through the open
lattices, darkened by the hanging foliage of
<PB N="194" REF="196">
the vines, appeared the du&s;ky land&s;cape,
the Garonne reflecting the evening light,
and the we&s;t &s;till glowing. A chair was
placed near one of the balconies, as if &s;ome
per&s;on had been &s;itting there, but the other
furniture of the pavilion remained exactly
as u&s;ual, and Emily thought it looked as
if it had not once been moved &s;ince &s;he &s;et
out for Italy. The &s;ilent and de&s;erted air
of the place added &s;olemnity to her emo|tions,
for &s;he heard only the low whi&s;per of
the breeze, as it &s;hook. the leaves of the
vines, and the very faint murmur of the
Garonne.</P>
<P>She &s;eated her&s;elf in a chair, near the lat|tice,
and yielded to the &s;adne&s;s of her heart,
while &s;he recollected the circum&s;tances of
her parting interview with Valancourt, on
this &s;pot. It was here too, that &s;he had
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the happie&s;t hours of her
life with him, when her aunt favoured the
connection, for here &s;he had often &s;at and
worked, while he conver&s;ed, or read; and
&s;he now well remembered with what di&s;cri|minating
<PB N="195" REF="197">
judgment, with what tempered
energy, he u&s;ed to repeat &s;ome of the &s;ub|lime&s;t
pa&s;&s;ages of their favourite authors;
how often he would pau&s;e to admire with
her their excellence, and with what tender
delight he would li&s;ten to her remarks, and
correct her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>"And is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Emily, as
the&s;e recollections returned&mdash;"is it po&s;&s;ible,
that a mind, &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of whatever is
grand and beautiful, could &s;toop to low
pur&s;uits, and be &s;ubdued by frivolous temp|tations?"</P>
<P>She remembered how often &s;he had &s;een
the &s;udden tear &s;tart in his eye, and had
heard his voice tremble with emotion,
while he related any great or benevolent
action, or repeated a &s;entiment of the &s;ame
character. "And &s;uch a mind," &s;aid &s;he,
"&s;uch a heart, were to be &s;acrificed to the
habits of a great city!"</P>
<P>The&s;e recollections becoming too painful
to be endured, &s;he abruptly left the pavi|lion,
and, anxious to e&s;cape from the memor|ials
<PB N="196" REF="198">
of her departed happine&s;s, returned
towards the chateau. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along
the terrace, &s;he perceived a per&s;on, walking,
with a &s;low &s;tep, and a dejected air, under
the trees, at &s;ome di&s;tance. The twilight,
which was now deep, would not allow her
to di&s;tingui&s;h who it was, and &s;he imagined
it to be one of the &s;ervants, till, the &s;ound
of her &s;teps &s;eeming to reach him, he turn|ed
half round, and &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw
Valancourt!</P>
<P>Whoever it was, he in&s;tantly &s;truck
among the thickets on the left, and di&s;ap|peared,
while Emily, her eyes fixed on the
place, whence he had vani&s;hed, and her
frame trembling &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that &s;he
could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf, remained,
for &s;ome moments, unable to quit the &s;pot,
and &s;carcely con&s;cious of exi&s;tence. With
her recollection, her &s;trength returned, and
&s;he hurried toward the hou&s;e, where &s;he
did not venture to enquire who had been
in the gardens, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould betray her
emotion; and &s;he &s;at down alone, endea|vouring
<PB N="197" REF="199">
to recollect the figure, air and fea|tures
of the per&s;on &s;he had ju&s;t &s;een. Her
view of him, however, had been &s;o tran|&s;ient,
and the gloom had rendered it &s;o im|perfect,
that &s;he could remember nothing
with exactne&s;s; yet the general appear|ance
of his figure, and his abrupt depar|ture,
made her &s;till believe, that this per|&s;on
was Valancourt. Sometimes, indeed,
&s;he thought, that her fancy, which had
been occupied by the idea of him, had
&s;ugge&s;ted his image to her uncertain &s;ight:
but this conjecture was fleeting. If it was
him&s;elf, whom &s;he had &s;een, &s;he wondered
much, that he &s;hould be at Tholou&s;e, and
more, how he had gained admittance into
the garden; but as often as her impatience
prompted her to enquire whether any &s;tranger
had been admitted, &s;he was re&s;trained by an
unwillingne&s;s to betray her doubts; and the
evening was pa&s;&s;ed in anxious conjecture,
and in efforts to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject from
her thoughts. But, the&s;e endeavours were
<PB N="198" REF="200">
ineffectual, and a thou&s;and incon&s;i&s;tent
emotions a&s;&s;ailed her, whenever &s;he fancied
that Valancourt might be near her; now,
&s;he dreaded it to be true, and now &s;he fear|ed
it to be fal&s;e; and, while &s;he con&s;tantly
tried to per&s;uade her&s;elf, that &s;he wi&s;hed
the per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een, might not
be Valancourt, her heart as con&s;tantly con|tradicted
her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The following day was occupied by the
vi&s;its of &s;everal neighbouring families, for|merly
intimate with Madame Montoni, who
came to condole with Emily on her death,
to congratulate her upon the acqui&s;ition of
the&s;e e&s;tates, and to enquire about Montoni,
and concerning the &s;trange reports they had
heard of her own &s;ituation; all which was
done with the utmo&s;t decorum, and the vi|&s;itors
departed with as much compo&s;ure as
they had arrived.</P>
<P>Emily was wearied by the&s;e formalities,
and di&s;gu&s;ted by the &s;ub&s;ervient manners of
many per&s;ons, who had thought her &s;carce|ly
<PB N="199" REF="201">
worthy of common attention, while &s;he
was believed to be a dependant on Madame
Montoni.</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid she, "there is &s;ome ma|gic
in wealth, which can thus make per|&s;ons
pay their court to it, when it does not
even benefit them&s;elves. How &s;trange it
is, that a fool or a knave, with riches,
&s;hould be treated with more re&s;pect by the
world, than a good man, or a wi&s;e man in
poverty!"</P>
<P>It was evening, before &s;he was left alone,
and &s;he then wi&s;hed to have refre&s;hed her
&s;pirits in the free air of her garden; but &s;he
feared to go thither, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet
again the per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een on
the preceding night, and he should prove
to be Valancourt. The &s;u&s;pen&s;e and anx|iety
&s;he &s;uffered, on this &s;ubject, &s;he found
all her efforts unable to controul, and her &s;e|cret
wi&s;h to &s;ee Valancourt once more, though
un&s;een by him, powerfully prompted her
to go, but prudence and a delicate pride re|&s;trained
<PB N="200" REF="202">
her; and &s;he determined to avoid
the po&s;&s;ibility of throwing her&s;elf in his
way, by forbearing to vi&s;it the gardens, for
&s;everal days.</P>
<P>When, after near a week, &s;he again ven|tured
thither, &s;he made Annette her com|panion,
and confined her walk to the lower
grounds, but often &s;tarted as the leaves
ru&s;tled in the breeze, imagining, that &s;ome
per&s;on was among the thickets; and, at the
turn of every alley, &s;he looked forward
with apprehen&s;ive expectation. She pur|&s;ued
her walk thoughtfully and &s;ilently,
for her agitation would not &s;uffer her to
conver&s;e with Annette, to whom, however,
thought and &s;ilence were &s;o intolerable, that
&s;he did not &s;cruple at length to talk to her
mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Dear madam," &s;aid &s;he, "why do you
&s;tart &s;o? one would think you knew what
has happened."</P>
<P>"What has happened?" &s;aid Emily, in
a faltering voice, and trying to command
her emotion.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="203">
"The night before la&s;t, you know, ma|dam"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I know nothing, Annette," replied
her lady in a more hurried voice.</P>
<P>"The night before la&s;t, madam, there
was a robber in the garden."</P>
<P>"A robber!" &s;aid Emily, in an eager,
yet doubting tone.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e he was a robber, madam,
What el&s;e could he be?"</P>
<P>"Where did you &s;ee him, Annette?" re|joined
Emily, looking round her, and
turning back towards the chateau.</P>
<P>"It was not I that &s;aw him, madam,
it was Jean the gardener. It was twelve
o'clock at night, and, as he was coming
acro&s;s the court to go the back way into
the hou&s;e, what &s;hould he &s;ee&mdash;but &s;ome|body
walking in the avenue, that fronts
the garden gate! So, with that, Jean gue&s;&s;ed
how it was, and he went into the hou&s;e for
his gun."</P>
<P>"His gun!" exclaimed Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, his gun; and then he
<PB N="202" REF="204">
came out into the court to watch him.
Pre&s;ently, he &s;ees him come &s;lowly down
the avenue, and lean over the garden gate,
and look up at the hou&s;e for a long time;
and I warrant he examined it well, and &s;et|tled
what window he &s;hould break in at."</P>
<P>"But the gun," &s;aid Emily&mdash;"the
gun!"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, all in good time. Pre|&s;ently,
Jean &s;ays, the robber opened the
gate, and was coming into the court, and
then he thought proper to a&s;k him his
bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;o he called out again, and bade
him &s;ay who he was, and what he wanted.
But the man would do neither; but turned
upon his heel, and pa&s;&s;ed into the garden
again. Jean knew then well enough how
it was, and &s;o he fired after him."</P>
<P>"Fired!" exclaimed Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, fired off his gun; but,
Holy Virgin! what makes you look &s;o
pale, madam? The man was not killed,&mdash;I
dare &s;ay; but if he was, his comrades
carried him off: for, when Jean went in the
<PB N="203" REF="205">
morning, to look for the body, it was gone,
and nothing to be &s;een but a track of blood
on the ground. Jean followed it, that he
might find out where the man got into
the garden, but it was lo&s;t in the gra&s;s,
and"&mdash;</P>
<P>Annette was interrupted: for Emily's
&s;pirits died away, and &s;he would have fal|len
to the ground, if the girl had not
caught her, and &s;upported her to a bench,
clo&s;e to them.</P>
<P>When, after a long ab&s;ence, her &s;en&s;es
returned, Emily de&s;ired to be led to her
apartment; and, though she trembled with
anxiety to enquire further on the &s;ubject
of her alarm, &s;he found her&s;elf too ill at
pre&s;ent, to dare the intelligence which it
was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might receive of Valan|court.
Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette, that &s;he
might weep and think at liberty, &s;he endea|voured
to recollect the exact air of the per|&s;on,
whom &s;he had &s;een on the terrace, and
&s;till her fancy gave her the figure of Va|lancourt.
She had, indeed, &s;carcely a
<PB N="204" REF="206">
doubt, that it was he whom &s;he had &s;een,
and at whom the gardener had fired: for
the manner of the latter per&s;on, as de&s;cribed
by Annette, was not that of a robber; nor
did it appear probable, that a robber would
have come alone, to break into a hou&s;e &s;o
&s;pacious as this.</P>
<P>When Emily thought her&s;elf &s;ufficiently
recovered, to li&s;ten to what Jean might
have to relate, &s;he &s;ent for him; but be
could inform her of no circum&s;tance, that
might lead to a knowledge of the per&s;on,
who had been &s;hot, or of the con&s;equence
of the wound; and, after &s;everely repri|manding
him, for having fired with bullets,
and ordering diligent enquiry to be made
in the neighbourhood for the di&s;covery of
the wounded per&s;on, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him,
and her&s;elf remained in the &s;ame &s;tate of
terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e. All the tenderne&s;s &s;he
had ever felt for Valancourt, was recalled
by the &s;en&s;e of his danger; and the more
&s;he con&s;idered the &s;ubject, the more her
conviction &s;trengthened, that it was he,
<PB N="205" REF="207">
who had vi&s;ited the gardens, for the pur|po&s;e
of &s;oothing the mi&s;ery of di&s;appointed
affection, amid&s;t the &s;cenes of his former
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>"Dear madam," &s;aid Annette, when
&s;he returned, "I never &s;aw you &s;o affected
before! I dare &s;ay the man is not killed."</P>
<P>Emily &s;huddered, and lamented bitterly
the ra&s;hne&s;s of the gardener in having
fired;</P>
<P>"I knew you would be angry enough
about that, madam, or I &s;hould have told
you before; and he knew &s;o too; for, &s;ays
he, "Annette, &s;ay nothing about this to my
lady. She lies on the other &s;ide of the
hou&s;e, &s;o did not hear the gun, perhaps;
but &s;he would be angry with me, if &s;he
knew, &s;eeing there is blood. But then,"
&s;ays he, "how is one to keep the garden
clear, if one is afraid to fire at a robber,
when one &s;ees him?"</P>
<P>"No more of this," &s;aid Emily, "pray
leave me."</P>
<P>Annette obeyed, and Emily returned to
<PB N="206" REF="208">
the agonizing con&s;iderations, that had a&s;&s;ail|ed
her before, but which &s;he, at length, en|deavoured
to &s;ooth by a new remark. If
the &s;tranger was Valancourt, it was cer|tain
he had come alone, and it appeared,
therefore, that he had been able to quit the
gardens, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a circum&s;tance
which did not &s;eem probable, had his wound
been dangerous. With this con&s;ideration,
&s;he endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf, during
the enquiries, that were making by her
&s;ervants in the neighbourhood; but day
after day came, and &s;till clo&s;ed in uncer|tainty,
concerning this affair; and Emily,
&s;uffering in &s;ilence, at length, drooped,
and &s;unk under the pre&s;&s;ure of her anx|iety.
She was attacked by a &s;low fever,
and when &s;he yielded to the per&s;uation of
Annette to &s;end for medical advice, the
physicians pre&s;cribed little be&s;ide air, gen|tle
exerci&s;e and amu&s;ement: but how was
this la&s;t to be obtained? She, however,
endeavoured to ab&s;tract her thoughts from
the &s;ubject of her anxiety, by employing
<PB N="207" REF="209">
them in promoting that happine&s;s in others,
which &s;he had loft her&s;elf; and, when the
evening was fine, &s;he u&s;ually took an air|ing,
including in her ride the cottages of
&s;ome of her tenants, on who&s;e condition
&s;he made &s;uch ob&s;ervations, as often en|abled
her, una&s;ked, to fulfil their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Her indi&s;po&s;ition, and the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he
engaged in, relative to this e&s;tate, had al|ready
protracted her &s;lay at Tholou&s;e,
beyond the period &s;he had formerly fixed
for her departure to La Vall&eacute;e; and now
&s;he was unwilling to leave the only place,
where it &s;eemed po&s;&s;ible, that certainty
could be obtained on the &s;ubject of her
di&s;tre&s;s. But the time was come, when her
pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary at La Vall&eacute;e, a let|ter
from the Lady Blanche now informing
her, that the Count and her&s;elf, being then
at the chateau of the Baron St. Foix, pur|po&s;ed
to vi&s;it her at La Vall&eacute;e, on their
way home, as &s;oon as they &s;hould be in|formed
of her arrival there. Blanche add|ed,
that they made this vi&s;it, with the
<PB N="208" REF="210">
hope of inducing her to return with them
to Chateau-le-Blanc.</P>
<P>Emily, having replied to the letter of her
friend, and &s;aid that &s;he &s;hould be at La Val|l&eacute;e
in a few days, made ha&s;ty preparations
for the journey; and, in thus leaving Tho|lou&s;e,
endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf with
a belief, that, if any fatal accident had hap|pened
to Valancourt, &s;he mu&s;t in this in|terval
have heard of it.</P>
<P>On the evening before her departure, &s;he
went to take leave of the terrace and the
pavilion. The day had been &s;ultry, but
a light &s;hower, that fell ju&s;t before &s;un-&s;et,
had cooled the air, and given that &s;oft ver|dure
to the woods and pa&s;tures, which is &s;o
refre&s;hing to the eye; while the rain-drops,
&s;till trembling on the &s;hrubs, glittered in
the la&s;t yellow gleam, that lighted up the
&s;cene, and the air was filled with fragrance,
exhaled by the late &s;hower, from herbs and
flowers and from the earth it&s;elf. But the
lovely pro&s;pect, which Emily beheld from
the terrace, was no longer viewed by her
<PB N="209" REF="211">
with delight; &s;he &s;ighed deeply as her eye
wandered over it, and her &s;pirits were in a
&s;tate of &s;uch dejection, that &s;he could not
think of her approaching return to La Val|l&eacute;e,
without tears, and &s;eemed to mourn
again the death of her father, as if it had
been an event of ye&s;terday. Having reach|ed
the pavilion, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at the
open lattice, and, while her eyes &s;ettled on
the di&s;tant mountains, that overlooked Ga&s;|cony,
&s;till gleaming on the horizon, though
the &s;un had now left the plains below,
"Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "I return to your long|lo&s;t
&s;cenes, but &s;hall meet no more the pa|rents,
that were wont to render them delight|ful!&mdash;no
more &s;hall &s;ee the &s;mile of wel|come,
or hear the well-known voice of
fondne&s;s:&mdash;all will now be cold and &s;ilent
in what was once my happy home."</P>
<P>Tears &s;tole down her cheek, as the re|membrance
of what that home had been,
returned to her; but, after indulging her
&s;orrow for &s;ome time, &s;he checked it, ac|cu&s;ing
her&s;elf of ingratitude in forgetting
<PB N="210" REF="212">
the friends, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, while &s;he
lamented tho&s;e that were departed; and
&s;he, at length, left the pavilion and the
terrace, without having ob&s;erved a &s;hadow
of Valancourt or of any other per&s;on.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the following morning, Emily left
Tholou&s;e at an early hour, and reached La
Vall&eacute;e about &s;un-&s;et. With the melancholy
&s;he experienced on the review of a place
which had been the re&s;idence of her parents,
and the &s;cene of her earlie&s;t delight, was
mingled, after the fir&s;t &s;hock had &s;ub&s;ided,
a tender and unde&s;cribable plea&s;ure. For
time had &s;o far blunted the acutene&s;s of
her grief, that &s;he now courted every &s;cene,
that awakened the memory of her friends;
in every room, where &s;he had been ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="212" REF="214">
to &s;ee them, they almo&s;t &s;eemed
to live again; and &s;he felt that La Vall&eacute;e
was &s;till her happie&s;t home. One of the fir&s;t
apartments &s;he vi&s;ited, was that, which had
been her father's library, and here &s;he &s;eated
her&s;elf in his arm-chair, and, while &s;he con|templated,
with tempered re&s;ignation, the
picture of pa&s;t times, which her memory
gave, the tears &s;he &s;hed could &s;carcely be
called tho&s;e of grief.</P>
<P>Soon after her arrival, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed
by a vi&s;it from the venerable M. Barreaux,
who came impatiently to welcome the daugh|ter
of his late re&s;pected neighbour, to her
long-de&s;erted home. Emily was comforted
by the pre&s;ence of an old friend, and they
pa&s;&s;ed an intere&s;ting hour in conver&s;ing of
former times, and in relating &s;ome of the
circum&s;tances, that had occurred to each,
&s;ince they parted.</P>
<P>The evening was &s;o far advanced, when
M. Barreaux left Emily, that &s;he could not
vi&s;it the garden that night; but, on the fol|lowing
morning, &s;he traced its long-regretted
<PB N="213" REF="215">
&s;cenes with fond impatience; and, as she
walked beneath the groves, which her fa|ther
had planted, and where &s;he had &s;o often
&s;auntered in affectionate conver&s;ation with
him, his countenance, his &s;mile, even the
accents of his voice, returned with exactne&s;s
to her fancy, and her heart melted to the
tender recollections.</P>
<P>This, too, was his favourite &s;ea&s;on of the
year, at which they had often together ad|mired
the rich and variegated tints of the&s;e
woods and the magical effect of autumnal
lights upon the mountains; and now, the
view of the&s;e circum&s;tances made memory
eloquent. As &s;he wandered pen&s;ively on,
&s;he fancied the following addre&s;s</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>TO AUTUMN.</HEAD>
<L>Sweet Autumn! how thy melancholy grace</L>
<L>Steals on my heart, as through the&s;e &s;hades I wind!</L>
<L>Sooth'd by thy breathing &s;igh, I fondly trace</L>
<L>Each lonely image of the pen&s;ive mind!</L>
<L>Lov'd &s;cenes, lov'd friends&mdash;long lo&s;t! around me ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And wake the melting thought, the tender tear!</L>
<L>That tear, that thought, which more than mirth I prize&mdash;</L>
<L>Sweet as the gradual tint, that paints thy year!</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="216">
Thy farewel &s;mile, with fond regret, I view.</L>
<L>Thy beaming lights, &s;oft gliding o'er the woods;</L>
<L>Thy di&s;tant land&s;cape, touch'd with yellow hue</L>
<L>While falls the lengthen'd gleam; thy winding floods,</L>
<L>Now veil'd in &s;hade, &s;ave where the &s;kiff's white fails</L>
<L>Swell to the breeze, and catch thy &s;treaming ray.</L>
<L>But now, e'en now!&mdash;the partial vi&s;ion fails,</L>
<L>And the wave &s;miles, as &s;weeps the cloud away!</L>
<L>Emblem of life!&mdash;Thus checquer'd is its plan,</L>
<L>Thus joy &s;ucceeds to grief&mdash;thus &s;miles the varied man!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>One of Emily's earlie&s;t enquiries, after
her arrival at La Vall&eacute;e, was concerning
There&s;a, her father's old &s;ervant, whom it
may be remembered that M. Que&s;nel had
turned from the hou&s;e when it was let, with|out
any provi&s;ion. Under&s;tanding that &s;he
lived in a cottage at no great di&s;tance, Emily
walked thither, and, on approaching, was
plea&s;ed to &s;ee, that her habitation was plea|&s;antly
&s;ituated on a green &s;lope, &s;heltered by
a tuft of oaks, and had an appearance of
comfort and extreme neatne&s;s. She found
the old woman within, picking vine-&s;talks,
who, on perceiving her young mi&s;tre&s;s, was
nearly overcome with joy.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="217">
"Ah! my dear young lady!" &s;aid &s;he,
"I thought I &s;hould never &s;ee you again in
this world, when I heard you was gone
to that outlandi&s;h country. I have been
hardly u&s;ed, &s;ince you went; I little thought
they would have turned me out of my old
ma&s;ter's family in my old age!"</P>
<P>Emily lamented the circum&s;tance, and then
a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he would make her latter
days comfortable, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction,
on &s;eeing her in &s;o plea&s;ant an habitation.</P>
<P>There&s;a thanked her with tears, adding,
"Yes, mademoi&s;elle, it is a very comfort|able
home, thanks to the kind friend, who
took me out of my di&s;tre&s;s, when you was
too far off to help me, and placed me here!
I little thought!&mdash;but no more of that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And who was this kind friend?" &s;aid.
Emily: "whoever it was, I &s;hall con&s;ider
him as mine al&s;o."</P>
<P>"Ah mademoi&s;elle! that friend forbad
me to blazon the good deed&mdash;I mu&s;t not
&s;ay, who it was. But how you are altered
&s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t! You look &s;o pale now,
<PB N="216" REF="218">
and &s;o thin, too; but then, there is my old
master's &s;mile! Yes, that will never leave
you, any more than the goodne&s;s, that u&s;ed
to make him &s;mile. Alas-a-day! the poor
lo&s;t a friend indeed, when he died!"</P>
<P>Emily was affected by this mention of her
father, which There&s;a ob&s;erving, changed
the &s;ubject. "I heard, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid
&s;he, "that Madame Cheron married a fo|reign
gentleman, after all, and took you
abroad; how does &s;he do?"</P>
<P>Emily now mentioned her death. "Alas!"
&s;aid There&s;a, "if &s;he had not been my ma|&s;ter's
&s;i&s;ter, I &s;hould never have loved her;
&s;he was always &s;o cro&s;s. But how does that
dear young gentleman do, M. Valancourt?
he was an hand&s;ome youth, and a good one;
is he well, mademoi&s;elle?"</P>
<P>Emily was much agitated.</P>
<P>"A ble&s;&s;ing on him!" continued The|re&s;a
"Ah, my dear young lady, you need
not look &s;o &s;hy; I know all about it. Do
you think I do not know, that he loves
you? Why, when you was away, mademoi|&s;elle,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
he u&s;ed to come to the chateau, and
walk about it, &s;o di&s;con&s;olate! He would go
into every room in the lower part of the
hou&s;e, and, &s;ometimes, he would &s;it him&s;elf
down in a chair, with his arms acro&s;s, and
his eyes on the floor, and there he would
&s;it, and think, and think, for the hour to|gether.
He u&s;ed to be very fond of the
&s;outh parlour, becau&s;e I told him it u&s;ed to
be yours; and there he would &s;tay, look|ing
at the pictures, which I &s;aid you drew,
and playing upon your lute, that hung up
by the window, and reading in your books,
till &s;un-&s;et, and then he mu&s;t go back to
his brother's chateau. And then&mdash;"</P>
<P>"It is enough, There&s;a," &s;aid Emily.&mdash;"How
long have you lived in this cottage&mdash;and
how can I &s;erve you? will you re|main
here, or return and live with me?"</P>
<P>"Nay, mademoi&s;elle!" &s;aid There&s;a,
"do not be &s;o &s;hy to your poor old &s;ervant.
I am &s;ure it is no di&s;grace to like &s;uch a
good young gentleman."</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="220">
A deep &s;igh e&s;caped from Emily.</P>
<P>"Ah! how he did love to talk of you!
I loved him for that. Nay, for that matter,
he liked to hear me talk, for he did not &s;ay
much him&s;elf. But I &s;oon found out what
he came to the chateau about. Then, he
would go into the garden, and down to
the terrace, and fit under that great tree
there, for the day together, with one of
your books in his hand; but he did not
read much, I fancy; for one day I hap|pened
to go that way, and I heard &s;ome|body
talking. Who can be here? &s;ays I: I
am &s;ure I let nobody into the garden, but
the Chevalier! So I walked &s;oftly, to &s;ee
who it could be; and behold! it was the
Chevalier him&s;elf, talking to him&s;elf about
you. And he repeated your name, and
&s;ighed &s;o! and &s;aid he had lo&s;t you for
ever, for that you would never return for
him. I thought he was out in his reckon|ing
there, but I &s;aid nothing, and &s;tole
away."</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">
"No more of this trifling," &s;aid Emily,
awakening from her reverie: "it di&s;plea&s;es
me;"</P>
<P>"But, when M. Que&s;nel let the chateau,
I thought it would have broke the Cheva|lier's
heart."</P>
<P>"There&s;a," &s;aid Emily &s;eriou&s;ly, "you
mu&s;t name the Chevalier no more!"</P>
<P>"Not name him, mademoi&s;elle!" cried
There&s;a: "what times are come up now?
Why, I love the Chevalier next to my old
ma&s;ter and you, mademoi&s;elle."</P>
<P>"Perhaps your love was not well be|&s;towed,
then," replied Emily, trying to con|ceal
her tears; "but, however that might
be, we &s;hall meet no more."</P>
<P>"Meet no more!&mdash;not well be&s;towed!"
exclaimed There&s;a. "What do I hear?
No, mademoi&s;elle, my love was well be|&s;towed,
for it was the Chevalier Valan|court,
who gave me this cottage, and has
&s;upported me in my old age, ever &s;ince
M. Que&s;nel turned me from my master's
hou&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">
"The Chevalier Valancourt!" &s;aid Emi|ly,
trembling extremely.</P>
<P>"Yes, mademoi&s;elle, he him&s;elf, though he
made me promi&s;e not to tell; but how could
one help, when one heard him ill &s;poken
of? Ah! dear young lady, you may well
weep, if you have behaved unkindly to
him, for a more tender heart than his never
young gentleman had. He found me out
in my di&s;tre&s;s, when you was too far off to
help me; and M. Que&s;nel refu&s;ed to do &s;o,
and bade me go to &s;ervice again&mdash;Alas! I was
too old for that I&mdash;The Chevalier found
me, and bought me this cottage, and gave
me money to furni&s;h it, and bade me &s;eek
out another poor woman to live with me;
and he ordered his brother's &s;teward to
pay me, every quarter, that which has &s;up|ported
me in comfort. Think then, ma|demoi&s;elle,
whether I have not rea&s;on to
&s;peak well of the Chevalier. And there
are others, who could have afforded it better
than he: and I am afraid he has hurt him|&s;elf
by his genero&s;ity, for quarter day is
<PB N="221" REF="223">
gone by long &s;ince, and no money for me!
But do not weep &s;o, mademoi&s;elle: you are
not &s;orry &s;urely to hear of the poor Cheva|lier's
goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Sorry!" &s;aid Emily, and wept the
more. "But how long is it &s;ince you have
&s;een him?"</P>
<P>"Not this many a day, mademoi&s;elle."</P>
<P>"When did you hear of him?" enquired
Emily, wish increa&s;ed emotion.</P>
<P>"Alas! never &s;ince he went away &s;o
&s;uddenly into Languedoc; and he was bur
ju&s;t come from Paris then, or I &s;hould
have &s;een him; I am &s;ure. Quarter day is
gone by long &s;ince, and, as I &s;aid, no
money for me; and I begin, to fear &s;ome
harm has happened to him: and if I was
not &s;o far from E&s;tuviere, and &s;o lame,
I &s;hould have gone to enquire before this
time, and I have nobody to &s;end &s;o far."</P>
<P>Emily's anxiety, as to the fate of Va|lancourt,
was now &s;carcely endurable,
and, &s;ince propriety would not &s;uffer her
to &s;end to the chateau of his brother, &s;he
<PB N="222" REF="224">
reque&s;ted that There&s;a would immediately
hire &s;ome per&s;on to go to his &s;teward from
her&s;elf, and, when he a&s;ked for the quarter|age
due to her, to make enquiries concern|ing
Valancourt. But &s;he fir&s;t made The|re&s;a
promi&s;e never to mention her name in
this affair, or ever with that of the Cheva|lier
Valancourt; and her former faithfulne&s;s
to M. St. Aubert induced Emily to confide
in her a&s;&s;urances. There&s;a now joyfully
undertook to procure a per&s;on for this er|rand,
and then Emily, after giving her a
&s;um of money to &s;upply her with pre&s;ent
comforts, returned, with &s;pirits heavily op|pre&s;&s;ed,
to her home, lamenting, more than
ever, that an heart, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much
benevolence as Valancourt's, should have
been contaminated by the vices of the
world, but affected by the delicate affec|tion,
which his kindne&s;s to her old &s;ervant
expre&s;&s;ed for her&s;elf.</P>

<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MEANWHILE Count De-Villefort and
Lady Blanche had pa&s;&s;ed a plea&s;ant fort|night
at the chateau de St. Foix, with the
Baron and Barone&s;s, during which they
made frequent excur&s;ions among the moun|tains,
and were delighted with the romantic
wildne&s;s of Pyren&eacute;an &s;cenery. It was with
regret, that the Count bade adieu to his
old friends, although with the hope of being
&s;oon united with them in one family; for it
was &s;ettled, that M. St. Foix, who now at|tended
them into Ga&s;cony, &s;hould receive
the hand of the Lady Blanche, upon their
arrival at Chateau-le-Blanc. As the road,
from the Baron's re&s;idence to La Vall&eacute;e, was
<PB N="224" REF="226">
over &s;ome of the wilde&s;t tract of the Pyre|n&eacute;es,
and where a carriage-wheel had never
pa&s;&s;ed, the Count hired mules for him&s;elf
and his family, as well as a couple of &s;tout
guides, who were well armed, informed of all
the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, and who boa&s;t|ed,
too, that they were acquainted with every
brake and dingle in the way, could tell the
names of all the highe&s;t points of this chain
of Alps, knew every fore&s;t, that &s;pread along
their narrow vallies, the &s;hallowe&s;t part of
every torrent they mu&s;t cro&s;s, and the exa&s;t
di&s;tance of every goat-herd's and hunter's
cabin they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s,&mdash;which
la&s;t article of learning required no
very capacious memory, for even &s;uch &s;im|ple
inhabitants were but thinly &s;cattered
over the&s;e wilds.</P>
<P>The Count left the chateau de St. Foix,
early in the morning, with an intention of
pa&s;&s;ing the night at a little inn upon the
mountains, about half way to La Vall&eacute;e, of
which his guides had informed him; and,
though this was frequented chiefly by Spa|ni&s;h
<PB N="225" REF="227">
muleteers, on their route into France,
and, of cour&s;e, would afford only &s;orry ac|commodation,
the Count had no alterna|tive,
for it was the only place like an inn,
on the road.</P>
<P>After a day of admiration and fatigue,
the travellers found them&s;elves, about &s;un|&s;et,
in a woody valley, overlooked, on every
&s;ide, by abrupt heights. They had pro|ceeded
for many leagues, without &s;eeing a
human habitation, and had only heard, now
and then, at a di&s;tance, the melancholy
tinkling of a &s;heep-bell; but now they
caught the notes of merry mu&s;ic, and pre|&s;ently
&s;aw, within a little green rece&s;s among
the rocks, a group of mountaineers, tripping
through a dance. The Count, who could
not look upon the happine&s;s, any more than
on the mi&s;ery of others, with indifference,
halted to enjoy this &s;cene of &s;imple plea|&s;ure.
The group before him con&s;i&s;ted of
French and Spani&s;h pea&s;ants, the inhabitants
of a neighbouring hamlet, &s;ome of whom
were performing a &s;prightly dance, the wo|men
<PB N="226" REF="228">
with ca&s;tanets in their hands, to the
&s;ounds of a lute and a tamborine, till, from
the bri&s;k melody of France, the mu&s;ic
&s;oftened into a &s;low movement, to which
two female pea&s;ants danced a Spani&s;h Pa|van.</P>
<P>The Count, comparing this with the
&s;cenes of &s;uch gaiety as he had witne&s;&s;ed at
Paris, where fal&s;e ta&s;te painted the features,
and, while it vainly tried to &s;upply the glow
of nature, concealed the charms of anima|tion&mdash;where
affectation &s;o often di&s;torted the
air, and vice perverted the manners&mdash;&s;ighed
to think, that natural graces and innocent
plea&s;ures flouri&s;hed in the wilds of &s;olitude,
while they drooped amid&s;t the concour&s;e of
poli&s;hed &s;ociety. But the lengthening &s;ha|dows
reminded the travellers, that they had
no time to lo&s;e; and, leaving this joyous
group, they pur&s;ued their way towards the
little inn, which was to &s;helter them from
the night.</P>
<P>The rays of the &s;etting &s;un now threw a
yellow gleam upon the fore&s;ts of pine and
<PB N="227" REF="229">
che&s;nut, that &s;wept down the lower region
of the mountains, and gave re&s;plendent tints
to the &s;nowy points above. But &s;oon, even
this light faded fa&s;t, and the &s;cenery a&s;&s;umed
a more tremendous appearance, inve&s;ted
with the ob&s;curity o twilight. Where the
torrent had been &s;een, it was now only
heard; where the wild cliffs had di&s;played
every variety of form and attitude, a dark
ma&s;s of mountains now alone appeared;
and the vale, which far, far below had
opened its dreadful cha&s;m, the eye could
no longer fathom. A melancholy gleam
&s;till lingered on the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t
Alps, overlooking the deep repo&s;e of even|ing,
and &s;eeming to make the &s;tillne&s;s of
the hour more awful.</P>
<P>Blanche viewed the &s;cene in &s;ilence, and
li&s;tened with enthu&s;ia&s;m to the murmur of
the pines, that extended in dark lines along
the mountains, and to the faint voice of the
izard, among the rocks, that came at inter|vals
on the air. But her enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;unk
into apprehen&s;ion, when, as the &s;hadows
<PB N="228" REF="230">
deepened, &s;he looked upon the doubtful
precipice, that bordered the road, as well
as on the various fanta&s;tic forms of dan|ger,
that glimmered through the ob&s;cu|rity
beyond it; and &s;he a&s;ked her father, how
far they were from the inn, and whether he
did not con&s;ider the road to be dangerous
at this late hour. The Count repeated the
fir&s;t que&s;tion to the guides, who returned a
doubtful an&s;wer, adding, that, when it was
darker, it would be &s;afe&s;t to re&s;t, till the
moon ro&s;e. "It is &s;carcely &s;afe to proceed
now," &s;aid the Count; but the guides, a&s;&s;ur|ing
him that there was no danger, went on.
Blanche, revived by this a&s;&s;urance, again in|dulged
a pen&s;ive plea&s;ure, as &s;he watched the
progre&s;s of twilight gradually &s;preading its
tints over the woods and mountains, and
&s;tealing from the eye every minuter feature
of the &s;cene, till the grand outlines of na|ture
alone remained. Then fell the &s;ilent
dews, and every wild flower, and aromatic
plant, that bloomed among the cliffs, breath|ed
forth its &s;weetne&s;s; then, too, when the
<PB N="229" REF="231">
mountain-bee had crept into its blo&s;&s;omed
bed, and the hum of every little infect, that
had floated gaily in the &s;un-beam, was
hu&s;hed, the found of many &s;treams, not
heard till now, murmured at a di&s;tance.&mdash;The
bats alone, of all the animals inhabiting
this region, &s;eemed awake; and, while they
&s;litted acro&s;s the &s;ilent path, which Blanche
was pur&s;uing, &s;he remembered the follow|ing
lines, which Emily had given her:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>TO THE BAT.</HEAD>
<L>From haunt of man, from day's obtru&s;ive glare;</L>
<L>Thou &s;hroud'&s;t thee in the ruin's ivy'd tow'r,</L>
<L>Or in &s;ome &s;hadowy glen's romantic bow'r,</L>
<L>Where wizard forme their my&s;tic charms prepare,</L>
<L>Where Horror lurks, and ever-boding Care!</L>
<L>But, at the &s;weet and &s;ilent ev'ning hour,</L>
<L>When clos'd in &s;leep is ev'ry languid flow'r,</L>
<L>Thou lov'&s;t to &s;port upon the twilight air,</L>
<L>Mocking the eye, that would thy cour&s;e pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>In many a wanton-round, ela&s;tic, gay,</L>
<L>Thou flit'&s;t athwart the pen&s;ive wand'rer's way,</L>
<L>As his lone foot&s;teps print the mountain-dew.</L>
<L>From Indian i&s;les thou com'&s;t, with Summer's car,</L>
<L>Twilight thy love&mdash;thy guide her beaming &s;tar!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232">
To a warm imagination, the dubious
forms, that float, half veiled in darkne&s;s, af|ford
a higher delight, than the mo&s;t di&s;|tinct
&s;cenery, that the &s;un can &s;hew. While
the fancy thus wanders over land&s;capes
partly of its own creation, a &s;weet compla|cency
&s;teals upon the mind, and</P>
<Q><L>Refines it all to &s;ubtle&s;t feeling,</L>
<L>Bids the tear of rapture roll.</L></Q>
<P>The di&s;tant note of a torrent, the weak
trembling of the breeze among the woods,
or the far-off &s;ound of a human voice, now
lo&s;t and heard again, are circum&s;tances
which wonderfully heighten the enthu&s;i|a&s;tic
tone of the mind. The young St.
Foix, who &s;aw the pre&s;entations of a &s;ervid
fancy, and felt whatever enthu&s;ia&s;m could
&s;ugge&s;t, &s;ometimes interrupted the &s;ilence,
which the re&s;t of the party &s;eemed by mu|tual
con&s;ent to pre&s;erve, remarking and
pointing out to Blanche the mo&s;t &s;triking
effect of the hour upon the &s;cenery; while
Blanche, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions were, beguiled
<PB N="231" REF="233">
by the conver&s;ation of her lover, yielded
to the ta&s;te &s;o congenial to his, and they
conver&s;ed in a low re&s;trained voice, the ef|fect
of the pen&s;ive tranquillity, which twi|light
and the &s;cene in&s;pired, rather than of
any fear, that they &s;hould be heard. Bur,
while the heart was thus &s;oothed to ten|derne&s;s,
St. Foix gradually mingled, with
his admiration of the country, a mention of
his affection; and he continued to &s;peak,
and Blanche to li&s;ten till the mountains,
the woods, and the magical illu&s;ions of twi|light
were remembered no more.</P>
<P>The &s;hadows of evening &s;oon &s;hifted to
the gloom of night, which was &s;omewhat
anticipated by the vapours, that, gathering
fa&s;t round the mountains, rolled in dark
wreaths along their &s;ides; and the guides
propo&s;ed to re&s;t, till the moon &s;hould ri&s;e,
adding, that they thought a &s;torm was
coming on. As they looked round for a
&s;pot, that might afford &s;ome kind of &s;helter,
an object was perceived ob&s;curely through
the du&s;k, on a point of rock, a little way
<PB N="232" REF="234">
down the mountain, which they imagined
to be a hunter's or a &s;hepherd's cabin, and
the party, with cautious &s;teps, proceeded
towards it. Their labour, however, was
not rewarded, or their apprehen&s;ions
&s;oothed; for, on reaching the object of their
&s;earch, they di&s;covered a monumental cro&s;s,
which marked the &s;pot to have been pollut|ed
by murder.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s would not permit them to
read the in&s;cription; but the guides knew
this to be a cro&s;s, rai&s;ed to the memory of
a Count de Beliard, who had been mur|dered
here by a horde of banditti, that had
infe&s;ted this part of the Pyren&eacute;es, a few
years before; and the uncommon &s;ize of
the monument &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the &s;uppo|&s;ition,
that it was erected for a per&s;on of
&s;ome di&s;tincion. Blanche &s;huddered, as
&s;he li&s;tened to &s;ome horrid particulars of
the Count's fate, which one of the guides
related in a low, re&s;trained tone, as if the
&s;ound of his own voice frightened him;
but, while they lingered at the cro&s;s, at|tending
<PB N="233" REF="235">
to his narrative, a fla&s;h of light|ning
glanced upon the rocks, thunder mut|tered
at a di&s;tance, and the travellers, now
alarmed, quitted this &s;cene of &s;olitary hor|ror,
in &s;earch of &s;helter.</P>
<P>Having regained their former track, the
guides, as they pa&s;&s;ed on, endeavoured to
intere&s;t the Count by various &s;tories of
robbery, and even of murder, which had
been perpetrated in the very places they
mu&s;t unavoidably pa&s;s, with accounts of
their own dauntle&s;s courage and wonder|ful
e&s;capes. The chief guide, or rather
he, who was the mo&s;t completely armed,
drawing forth one of the four pi&s;tols, that
were tucked into his belt, &s;wore, that it
had &s;hot three robbers within the year. He
then brandi&s;hed a cla&s;p-knife of enormous
length, and was going to recount the won|derful
execution it had done, when St,
Foix, perceiving, that Blanche was terri|fied,
interrupted him. The Count, mean|while,
&s;ecretly laughing at the terrible hi&s;|tories
and extravagant boa&s;tings of the man,
<PB N="254" REF="236">
re&s;olved to humour him, and, telling
Blanche in a whi&s;per, his de&s;ign, began
to recount &s;ome exploits of his own, which
infinitely exceeded any related by the
guide.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tances he &s;o
artfully gave the colouring of truth, that
the courage of the guides was vi&s;ibly affect|ed
by them, who continued &s;ilent, long af|ter
the Count had cea&s;ed to &s;peak. The
loquacity of the chief hero thus laid a&s;leep,
the vigilance of his eyes and ears &s;eemed
more thoroughly awakened, for he li&s;tened,
with much appearance of anxiety, to the
deep thunder, which murmured at inter|vals,
and often pau&s;ed, as the breeze, that
was now ri&s;ing, ru&s;hed among the pines.
But, when he made a &s;udden halt before
a tuft of cork trees, that projected over
the road, and drew forth a pi&s;tol, before
he would venture to brave the banditti
which might lurk behind it, the Count
could no longer refrain from laughter.</P>
<P>Having now, however, arrived at a level
<PB N="235" REF="237">
&s;pot, &s;omewhat &s;heltered from the air, by
overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch,
that ro&s;e over a precipice on the left, and
the guides being yet ignorant how far they
were from the inn, the travellers determined
to re&s;t, till the moon &s;hould ri&s;e, or the
&s;torm di&s;per&s;e. Blanche, recalled to a &s;en&s;e
of the pre&s;ent moment, looked on the &s;ur|rounding
gloom, with terror; but giving
her hand to St. Foix, &s;he alighted, and the
whole party entered a kind of cave, if &s;uch
it could be called, which was only a &s;hal|low
cavity, formed by the curve of impend|ing
rocks. A light being &s;truck, a fire was
kindled, who&s;e blaze afforded &s;ome degree
of cheerfulne&s;s and no &s;mall comfort, for,
though the day had been hot, the night air
of this mountainous region was chilling;
a fire was partly nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to keep off
the wolves, with which tho&s;e wilds were
infe&s;ted.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions being &s;pread upon a project|tion
of the rock, the Count and his family
partook of a &s;upper, which, in a &s;cene le&s;s
<PB N="236" REF="238">
rude, would, certainly have been thought
le&s;s excellent. When the repa&s;t was fini&s;h|ed,
St. Foix, impatient for the moon,
&s;auntered along the precipice, to a point,
that fronted the ea&s;t; but all was yet wrapt
in gloom, and the &s;ilence of night was
broken only by the murmuring of woods,
that waved far below, or by di&s;tant
thunder, and, now and then, by the faint
voices of the party he had quitted. He
viewed, with emotions of awful &s;ublimity,
the long volumes of &s;ulphureous clouds,
that floated along the upper and middle
regions of the air, and the lightnings that
fla&s;hed from them, &s;ometimes &s;ilently, and,
at others, followed by &s;ullen peals of thun|der,
which the mountains feebly prolonged,
while the whole horizon, and the aby&s;s, on
which he &s;tood, were di&s;covered in the mo|mentary
light. Upon the &s;ucceeding dark|ne&s;s,
the fire, which had been kindled in
the cave, threw a partial gleam, illumining
&s;ome points of the oppo&s;ite rocks, and the
&s;ummits of pine-woods, that hung beetling
<PB N="237" REF="239">
on the cliffs below, while their rece&s;&s;es
&s;eemed to frown in deeper &s;hade.</P>
<P>St. Foix &s;topped to ob&s;erve the picture,
which the party in the cave pre&s;ented,
where the elegant form of Blanche was
finely contra&s;ted by the maje&s;tic figure of
the Count, who was &s;eated by her on a
rude &s;tone, and each was rendered more
impre&s;&s;ive by the grote&s;que habits and
&s;trong features of the guides and other at|tendants,
who were in the back ground
of the piece. The effect of the light,
too, was intere&s;ting; on the &s;urrounding
figures it threw a &s;trong, though pale
gleam, and glittered on their bright arms;
while upon the foliage of a gigantic larch,
that impended its &s;hade over the cliff above,
appeared a red, du&s;ky tint, deepening almo&s;t
imperceptibly into the blackne&s;s of night.</P>
<P>While St. Foix contemplated the &s;cene,
the moon, broad and yellow, ro&s;e over the
ea&s;tern &s;ummits, from among embattled
clouds, and &s;hewed dimly the grandeur of
the heavens, the ma&s;s of vapours, that roll|ed
<PB N="238" REF="240">
half way down the precipice beneath,
and the doubtful mountains.</P>
<Q><L>What dreadful plea&s;ure! there to &s;tand &s;ublime,</L>
<L>Like &s;hipwreck'd mariner on de&s;ert coa&s;t,</L>
<L>And view th' enormous wa&s;te of vapour, to&s;t</L>
<L>In billows length'ning to th' horizon round<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Min&s;trel.</NOTE>!</L></Q>
<P>From this romantic reverie he was awa|kened
by the voices of the guides, repeat|ing
his name, which was reverbed from
cliff to cliff, till an hundred tongues &s;eemed
to call him; when he &s;oon quieted the
fears of the Count and the Lady Blanche,
by returning to the cave. As the &s;torm,
however, &s;eemed approaching, they did not
quit their place of &s;helter; and the Count,
&s;eated between his daughter and St. Foix,
endeavoured to divert the fears of the for|mer,
and conver&s;ed on &s;ubjects, relating to
the natural hi&s;tory of the &s;cene, among
which they wandered. He &s;poke of the
mineral and fo&s;&s;ile &s;ub&s;tances, found in the
depths of the&s;e mountains,&mdash;the veins of
marble and granite, with which they
<PB N="239" REF="241">
abounded, the &s;trata of &s;hells, di&s;covered
near their &s;ummits, many thou&s;and fathom
above the level of the &s;ea, and at a va&s;t di&s;|tance
from its pre&s;ent &s;hore;&mdash;of the tre|mendous
cha&s;ms and caverns of the rocks,
the grote&s;que form of the mountains, and
the various phaenomena, that &s;eem to &s;tamp
upon the world the hi&s;tory of the deluge.
From the natural hi&s;tory he de&s;cended to
the mention of events and circum&s;tances,
connected with the civil &s;tory of the Py|ren&eacute;es;
named &s;ome of the mo&s;t remark|able
fortre&s;&s;es, which France and Spain
had erected in the pa&s;&s;es of the&s;e moun|tains;
and gave a brief account of &s;ome
celebrated &s;ieges and encounters in early
times, when Ambition fir&s;t frightened So|litude
from the&s;e her deep rece&s;&s;es, made
her mountains, which before had echoed
only to the torrent's roar, tremble with the
clang of arms, and, when man's fir&s;t foot|&s;teps
in her &s;acred haunts had left the
print of blood!</P>
<P>As Blanche &s;at, attentive to the narra|tive,
<PB N="240" REF="242">
that rendered the &s;cenes doubly in|tere&s;ting,
and re&s;igned to &s;olemn emotion,
while &s;he con&s;idered, that &s;he was on the
very ground, once polluted by the&s;e events,
her reverie was &s;uddenly interrupted by a
&s;ound, that came in the wind.&mdash;It was the
di&s;tant bark of a watch-dog. The travellers
li&s;tened with eager hope, and, as the wind
blew &s;tronger, fancied, that the &s;ound came
from no great di&s;tance; and, the guides hav|ing
little doubt, that it proceeded from the
inn they were in &s;earch of, the Count deter|mined
to pur&s;ue his way. The moon now
afforded a &s;tronger, though &s;till an uncertain
light, as &s;he moved among broken clouds;
and the travellers, led by the &s;ound, re-com|menced
their journey along the brow of the
precipice, preceded by a &s;ingle torch, that
now contended with the moon-light; for
the guides, believing they &s;hould reach
the inn &s;oon after &s;un-&s;et, had neglected to
provide more. In &s;ilent caution they fol|lowed
the &s;ound, which was heard but
at intervals, and which, after &s;ome time
<PB N="241" REF="243">
entirely cea&s;ed. The guides endeavoured,
however, to point their cour&s;e to the quarter,
whence it had i&s;&s;ued, but the deep roaring of
a torrent &s;oon &s;eized their attention, and pre|&s;ently
they came to a tremendous cha&s;m of
the mountain, which &s;eemed to forbid all
further progre&s;s. Blanche alighted from
her mule, as did the Count and St. Foix,
while the guides traver&s;ed the edge in &s;earch
of a bridge, which, however rude, might
convey them to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and they,
at length, confe&s;&s;ed, what the Count had
begun to &s;u&s;pect, that they had been, for
&s;ome time, doubtful of their way, and were
now certain only, that they had lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance, was di&s;covered a
rude and dangerous pa&s;&s;age, formed by an
enormous pine, which, thrown acro&s;s the
cha&s;m, united the oppo&s;ite precipices, and
which had been felled probably by the hun|ter,
to facilitate his chace of the izard, or
the wolf. The whole party, the guides ex|cepted,
&s;huddered at the pro&s;pect of cro&s;&s;ing
this alpine bridge, who&s;e &s;ides afforded no
<PB N="242" REF="244">
kind of defence, and from which to fall was
to die. The guides, however, prepared to
lead over the mules, while Blanche &s;tood
trembling on the brink, and li&s;tening to
the roar of the waters, which were &s;een
de&s;cending from rocks above, overhung
with lofty pines, and thence precipitating
them&s;elves into the deep aby&s;s, where their
white &s;urges gleamed faintly in the moon|light.
The poor animals proceeded over
this perilous bridge with in&s;tinctive caution,
neither frightened by the noi&s;e of the cata|ract,
or deceived by the gloom, which the
impending foliage threw athwart their way.
It was now, that the &s;olitary torch, which
had been hitherto of little &s;ervice, was found
to be an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure; and Blanche,
terrified, &s;hrinking, but endeavouring to re|collect
all her firmne&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind,
preceded by her lover and &s;upported by
her father, followed the red gleam of the
torch, in &s;afety, to the oppo&s;ite cliff.</P>
<P>As they went on, the heights contracted,
and formed a narrow pa&s;s, at the bottom of
<PB N="243" REF="245">
which, the torrent they had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed, was
heard to thunder. But they were again
cheered by the bark of a dog, keeping
watch, perhaps, over the flocks of the
mountains, to protect them from the nightly
de&s;cent of the wolves. The &s;ound was
much nearer than before, and, while they
rejoiced in the hope of &s;oon reaching a
place of repo&s;e, a light was &s;een to glim|mer
at a di&s;tance. It appeared at a height
con&s;iderably above the level of their path,
and was lo&s;t and &s;een again, as if the waving
branches of trees &s;ometimes excluded and
then admitted its rays. The guides hal|looed
with all their &s;trength, but the &s;ound
of no human voice was heard in return,
and, at length, as a more effectual means
of making them&s;elves known, they fired a
pi&s;tol. But, while they li&s;tened in anxious
expectation, the noi&s;e of the explo&s;ion was
alone heard, echoing among the rocks, and
it gradually &s;unk into a &s;ilence, which no
friendly hint of man di&s;turbed. The light,
however, that had been &s;een before, now
<PB N="244" REF="246">
became plainer, and, &s;oon after, voices were
heard indi&s;tinctly on the wind; but, upon
the guides repeating the call, the voices
&s;uddenly cea&s;ed, and the light di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche was now almo&s;t &s;ink|ing
beneath the pre&s;&s;ure of anxiety, fatigue
and apprehen&s;ion, and the united efforts of
the Count and St. Foix could &s;carcely
&s;upport her &s;pirits. As they continued to
advance, an object was perceived on a point
of rock above, which, the &s;trong rays of the
moon then falling on it, appeared to be a
watch-tower. The Count, from its &s;ituation
and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, had little
doubt, that it was &s;uch, and believing, that
the light had proceeded from thence, he en|deavoured
to re-animate his daughter's &s;pirits
by the near pro&s;pect of &s;helter and repo&s;e,
which, however rude the accommodation,
a ruined watch-tower might afford.</P>
<P>"Numerous watch-towers have been
erected among the Pyren&eacute;es," &s;aid the
Count, anxious only to call Blanche's atten|tion
from the &s;ubject of her fears; "and
<PB N="245" REF="247">
the method, by which they give intelligence
of the approach of the enemy, is, you know,
by fires, kindled on the &s;ummits of the&s;e
edifices. Signals have thus, &s;ometimes, been
communicated from po&s;t to po&s;t, along a
frontier line of &s;everal hundred miles in
length. Then, as occa&s;ion may require,
the lurking armies emerge from their for|tre&s;&s;es
and the fore&s;ts, and march forth, to
defend, perhaps, the entrance of &s;ome
grand pa&s;s, where, planting them&s;elves on
the heights, they a&s;&s;ail their a&s;toni&s;hed ene|mies,
who wind along the glen below, with
fragments of the &s;hattered cliff, and pour
death and defeat upon them. The ancient
forts, and watch-towers, overlooking the
grand pa&s;&s;es of the Pyren&eacute;es, are carefully
pre&s;erved; but &s;ome of tho&s;e in inferior &s;ta|tions
have been &s;uffered to fall into decay,
and are now frequently converted into the
more peaceful habitation of the hunter, or
the &s;hepherd, who, after a day of toil, re|tires
hither, and, with his faithful dogs, for|gets,
near a cheerful blaze, the labour of the
<PB N="246" REF="248">
chace, or the anxiety of collecting his wan|dering
flocks, while he is &s;heltered from the
nightly &s;torm."</P>
<P>"But are they always thus peacefully
inhabited?" &s;aid the Lady Blanche.</P>
<P>"No," replied the Count, "they are &s;ometimes the a&s;ylum of French and Spa|ni&s;h
&s;mugglers, who cro&s;s the mountains
with contraband goods from their re&s;pec|tive
countries, and the latter are parti|cularly
numerous, again&s;t whom &s;trong
parties of the king's troops are &s;ometimes
&s;ent. But the de&s;perate re&s;olution of the&s;e
adventurers, who, knowing, that, if they
are taken, they mu&s;t expiate the breach of
the law by the mo&s;t cruel death, travel in
large parties, well armed, often daunts the
courage of the &s;oldiers. The &s;mugglers,
who &s;eek only &s;afety, never engage, when
they can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it; the military,
al&s;o, who know, that in the&s;e encounters,
danger is certain, and glory almo&s;t unattain|able,
are equally reluctant to fight; an en|gagement,
therefore, very &s;eldom happens,
<PB N="247" REF="249">
but, when it does, it never concludes till
after the mo&s;t de&s;perate and bloody conflict.
You are inattentive, Blanche," added the
Count: "I have wearied you with a dull
&s;ubject; but &s;ee, yonder, in the moon-light,
is the edifice we have been in &s;earch of,
and we are fortunate to be &s;o near it, before
the &s;torm bur&s;ts."</P>
<P>Blanche, looking up, perceived, that they
were at the foot of the cliff, on who&s;e &s;ummit
the building &s;tood, but no light now i&s;&s;ued
from it; the barking of the dog too had,
for &s;ome time, cea&s;ed, and the guides began
to doubt, whether this was really the object
of their &s;earch. From the di&s;tance, at which
they &s;urveyed it, &s;hewn imperfectly by a
cloudy moon, it appeared to be of more ex|tent
than a &s;ingle watch-tower; but the
difficulty was how to a&s;cend the height,
who&s;e abrupt declivities &s;eemed to afford
no kind of path-way.</P>
<P>While the guides carried forward the
torch to examine the cliff, the Count, re|maining
with Blanche and St. Foix at its
<PB N="248" REF="250">
foot, under the &s;hadow of the woods, en|deavoured
again to beguile the time by con|ver&s;ation,
but again anxiety ab&s;tracted the
mind of Blanche; and he then con&s;ulted,
apart with St. Foix, whether it would be
advi&s;able, &s;hould a path be found, to ven|ture
to an edifice, which might po&s;&s;ibly
harbour banditti. They con&s;idered, that
their own party was not &s;mall, and that &s;e|veral
of them were well armed; and, after
enumerating the dangers, to be incurred by
pa&s;&s;ing the night in the open wild, expo&s;ed,
perhaps, to the effect of a thunder-&s;torm,
there remained not a doubt, that they ought
to endeavour to obtain admittance to the
edifice above, at any hazard re&s;pecting the
inhabitants it might harbour; but the dark|ne&s;s
and the dead &s;ilence, that &s;urrounded it,
appeared to contradict the probability of its
being inhabited at all.</P>
<P>A &s;hout from the guides arou&s;ed their at|tention,
after which, in a few minutes, one
of the Count's &s;ervants returned with intelli|gence,
that a path was found, and they im|mediately
<PB N="249" REF="251">
ha&s;tened to join the guides, when
they all a&s;cended a little winding way cut
in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood,
and, after much toil and &s;ome danger,
reached the &s;ummit, where &s;everal ruined
towers, &s;urrounded by a ma&s;&s;y wall, ro&s;e
to their view, partially illumined by the
moon-light. The &s;pace around the building
was &s;ilent, and apparently for&s;aken, but the
Count was cautious; "Step &s;oftly," &s;aid
he, in a low voice, "while we reconnoiter
the edifice."</P>
<P>Having proceeded &s;ilently along for &s;ome
paces, they &s;topped at a gate, who&s;e portals
were terrible even in ruins, and, after a mo|ment's
he&s;itation, pa&s;led on to the court of
entrance, but pau&s;ed again at the head of a
terrace, which, branching from it, ran along
the brow of a precipice. Over this, ro&s;e the
main body of the edifice, which was now
&s;een to be, not a watch-tower, but one or
tho&s;e ancient fortre&s;&s;es, that, from age and
neglect, had fallen to decay. Many parts
of it, however, appeared to be &s;till entire;
<PB N="250" REF="252">
it was built of grey &s;tone, in the heavy
Saxon-gothic &s;tyle, with enormous round
towers, buttre&s;&s;es of proportionable &s;trength,
and the arch of the large gate, which &s;eemed
to open into the hall of the fabric, was
round, as was that of a window above. The
air of &s;olemnity, which mu&s;t &s;o &s;trongly
have characterized the pile even in the days
of its early &s;trength, was now con&s;iderably
heightened by its &s;hattered battlements and
half-demoli&s;hed walls, and by the huge
ma&s;&s;es of ruin, &s;cattered in its wide area,
now &s;ilent and gra&s;s grown. In this court
of entrance &s;tood the gigantic remains of an
oak, that &s;eemed to have flouri&s;hed and de|cayed
with the building, which it &s;till ap|peared
frowningly to protect by the few re|maining
branches, leafle&s;s and mo&s;s-grown,
that crowned its trunk, and who&s;e wide ex|tent
told how enormous the tree had been in
a former age. This fortre&s;s was evidently
once of great &s;trength, and, from its &s;itua|tion
on a point of rock, impending over a
deep glen, had been of great power to an|noy,
<PB N="251" REF="253">
as well as to re&s;i&s;t; the Count, there|fore,
as he &s;tood &s;urveying it, was &s;omewhat
&s;urpri&s;ed, that it had been &s;uffered, ancient
as it was, to &s;ink into ruins, and its pre&s;ent
lonely and de&s;erted air excited in his brea&s;t
emotions of melancholy awe. While he
indulged, for a moment, the&s;e emotions, he
thought he heard a &s;ound of remote voices
&s;teal upon the &s;tillne&s;s, from within the
building, the front of which he again &s;ur|veyed
with &s;crutinizing eyes, but yet no light
was vi&s;ible. He now determined to walk
round the fort, to that remote part of it,
whence he thought the voices had ari&s;en,
that he might examine whether any light
could be di&s;cerned there, before he ventured
to knock at the gate; for this purpo&s;e,
he entered upon the terrace, where the re|mains
of cannon were yet apparent in the
thick walls, but he had not proceeded
many paces, when his &s;teps were &s;uddenly
arre&s;ted by the loud barking of a dog
within, and which he fancied to be the &s;ame,
who&s;e voice had been the means of bringing
<PB N="252" REF="254">
the travellers thither. It now appeared cer|tain,
that the place was inhabited, and the
Count returned to con&s;ult again with St.
Foix, whether he &s;hould try to obtain ad|mittance,
for its wild a&s;pect had &s;omewhat
&s;haken his former re&s;olution; but, after a
&s;econd con&s;ultation, he &s;ubmitted to the con|&s;iderations,
which before determined him,
and which were &s;trengthened by the di&s;co|very
of the dog, that guarded the fort,
as well as by the &s;tillne&s;s that pervaded
it. He, therefore, ordered one of his &s;er|vants
to knock at the gate, who was ad|vancing
to obey him, when a light appeared
through the loop-hole of one of the towers,
and the Count called loudly, but, receiving
no an&s;wer, he went up to the gate him&s;elf,
and &s;truck upon it with an iron-pointed pole,
which had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to climb the &s;teep.
When the echoes had cea&s;ed, that this blow
had awakened, the renewed barking,&mdash;and
there were now more than one dog,&mdash;was
the only &s;ound, that was heard. The Count
&s;tepped back, a few paces, to ob&s;erve
<PB N="253" REF="255">
whether the light was in the tower, and,
perceiving, that it was gone, he returned to
the portal, and had lifted the pole to
&s;trike again, when again he fancied he heard
the murmur of voices within, and pau&s;ed
to li&s;ten. He was confirmed in the &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
but they were too remote, to be heard
otherwi&s;e than in a murmur, and the Count
now let the pole fall heavily upon the gate;
when almo&s;t immediately a profound &s;ilence
followed. It was apparent, that the people
within had heard the &s;ound, and their cau|tion
in admitting &s;trangers gave him a
favourable opinion of them. "They are
either hunters or &s;hepherds," &s;aid he,
"who, like our&s;elves, have probably &s;ought
&s;helter from the night within the&s;e walls,
and are fearful of admitting &s;trangers, le&s;t
they &s;hould prove robbers. I will endea|vour
to remove their fears." So &s;aying, he
called aloud, "We are friends, who a&s;k
&s;helter from the night." In a few moments,
&s;teps were heard within, which approached,
and a voice then enquired&mdash;"Who calls?"
<PB N="254" REF="256">
"Friends," repeated the Count; "open
the gates, and you &s;hall know more."&mdash;Strong
bolts were now heard to be un|drawn,
and a man, armed with a hunting
&s;pear, appeared. "What is it you want
at this hour?" &s;aid he. The Count beck|oned
his attendants, and then, an&s;wered,
that he wi&s;hed to enquire the way to the
neare&s;t cabin. "Are you &s;o little acquainted
with the&s;e mountains," &s;aid the man, "as
not to know, that there is none, within &s;e|veral
leagues? I cannot &s;hew you the way;
you mu&s;t &s;eek it&mdash;there's a moon." Saying
this, he was clo&s;ing the gate, and the Count
was turning away, half di&s;appointed and
half afraid, when another voice was heard
from above, and, on looking up, he &s;aw a
light, and a man's face, at the grate of the
portal. "Stay, friend, you have lo&s;t your
way?" &s;aid the voice. "You are hunters,
I &s;uppo&s;e, like our&s;elves: I will be with
you pre&s;ently." The voice cea&s;ed, and the
light di&s;appeared. Blanche had been alarm|ed
by the appearance of the man, who had
<PB N="255" REF="257">
opened the gate, and &s;he now entreated her
father to quit the place; but the Count
had ob&s;erved the hunter's &s;pear, which he
carried; and the words from the tower en|couraged
him to await the event. The gate
was &s;oon opened, and &s;everal men in hun|ters'
habits, who had heard above what had
pa&s;&s;ed below, appeared, and, having li&s;tened
&s;ome time to the Count, told him he was
welcome to re&s;t there for the night. They
then pre&s;&s;ed him, with much courte&s;y, to
enter, and to partake of &s;uch fare as they
were about to &s;it down to. The Count,
who had ob&s;erved them attentively while
they &s;poke, was cautious, and &s;omewhat &s;u&s;|picious;
but he was al&s;o weary, fearful of
the approaching &s;torm, and of encountering
alpine heights in the ob&s;curity of night;
being likewi&s;e &s;omewhat confident in the
&s;trength and number of his attendants, he,
after &s;ome further con&s;ideration, determined
to accept the invitation. With this re&s;o|lution
he called his &s;ervants, who, advan|cing
round the tower, behind which &s;ome of
<PB N="256" REF="258">
them had &s;ilently li&s;tened to this conference,
followed their Lord, the Lady Blanche, and
St. Foix into the fortre&s;s. The &s;trangers
led them on to a large and rude hall, par|tially
&s;een by a fire, that blazed at its extre|mity,
round which four men, in the hunter's
dre&s;s, were &s;eated, and on the hearth were
&s;everal dogs &s;tretched in &s;leep. In the
middle of the hall &s;tood a large table, and
over the fire &s;ome part of an animal was
boiling. As the Count approached, the men
aro&s;e, and the dogs, half rai&s;ing them&s;elves,
looked fiercely at the &s;trangers, but, on
hearing their ma&s;ters' voices, kept their
po&s;tures on the hearth.</P>
<P>Blanche looked round this gloomy and &s;pa|cious
hall; then at the men, and to her father,
who, &s;miling cheerfully at her, addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to the hunters. "This is an ho&s;pi|table
hearth," &s;aid he, "the blaze of a fire is
reviving after having wandered &s;o long in
the&s;e dreary wilds. Your dogs are tired;
what &s;ucce&s;s have you had?" "Such as we
u&s;ually have," replied one of the men, who
<PB N="257" REF="259">
had been &s;eated in the hall, "we kill our
game with tolerable certainty." "The&s;e
are fellow hunters," &s;aid one of the men who
had brought the Count hither, "that have
lo&s;t their way, and I have told them there is
room enough in the fort for us all." "Very
true, very true," replied his companion,
"What luck have you had in the chace,
brothers? We have killed two izards, and
that, you will &s;ay, is pretty well." "You
mi&s;take, friend," &s;aid the Count, "we are
not hunters, but travellers; but, if you will
admit us to hunters' fare, we &s;hall be well
contented, and will repay your kindne&s;s."
"Sit down then, brother," &s;aid one of the
men: "Jacques, lay more fuel on the fire,
the kid will &s;oon be ready; bring a &s;eat for
the lady too. Ma'am&s;elle, will you ta&s;te
our brandy? it is true Barcelona, and as
bright as ever flowed from a keg." Blanche
timidly &s;miled, and was going to refu&s;e,
when her father prevented her, by taking,
with a good humoured air, the gla&s;s offered
to his daughter; and Mon&s;. St. Foix, who
<PB N="258" REF="260">
was &s;eated next her, pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and
gave her an encouraging look, but her at|tention
was engaged by a man, who &s;at
&s;ilently by the fire, ob&s;erving St. Foix, with
a &s;teady and earne&s;t eye.</P>
<P>"You lead a jolly life here," &s;aid the
Count. "The life of a hunter is a plea&s;ant
and a healthy one; and the repo&s;e is &s;weet,
which &s;ucceeds to your labour."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied one of his ho&s;ts, "our
life is plea&s;ant enough. We live here only
during the &s;ummer, and autumnal months;
in winter, the place is dreary, and the
&s;woln torrents, that de&s;cend from the
heights, put a &s;top to the chace."</P>
<P>"'Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment,"
&s;aid the Count: "I &s;hould like to pa&s;s a
month in your way very well."</P>
<P>"We find employment for our guns
too," &s;aid a man who &s;tood behind the
Count:" here are plenty of birds, of deli|cious
flavour, that feed upon the wild thyme
and herbs, that grow in the vallies. Now
I think of it, there is a brace of bird's hung
<PB N="259" REF="261">
up in the &s;tone gallery; go fetch them,
Jacques, we will have them dre&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>The Count now made enquiry, concern|ing
the method of pur&s;uing the chace among
the rocks and precipices of the&s;e romantic
regions, and was li&s;tening to a curious de|tail,
when a horn was &s;ounded at the gate.
Blanche looked timidly at her father, who
continued to conver&s;e on the &s;ubje&s;t of the
chace, but who&s;e countenance was &s;omewhat
expre&s;&s;ive of anxiety, and who often turned
his eyes towards that part of the hall neare&s;t
the gate. The horn founded again, and a
loud halloo &s;ucceeded. "The&s;e are &s;ome
of our companions, returned from their
day's labour," &s;aid a man, going lazily from
his &s;eat towards the gate; and in a few mi|nutes,
two men appeared, each with a gun
over his &s;houlder, and pi&s;tols in his belt.
"What cheer, my lads? what cheer?" &s;aid
they, as they approached. "What luck?"
returned their companions: "have you
brought home your &s;upper? You &s;hall have
none el&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="262">
"Hah! who the devil have you brought
home?" &s;aid they in bad Spani&s;h, on per|ceiving
the Count's party, "are they from
France, or Spain?&mdash;where did you meet
with them?"</P>
<P>"They met with us, and a merry meet|ing
too," replied his companion aloud in
good French. "This chevalier, and his
party, had lo&s;t their way, and a&s;ked a night's
lodging in the fort." The others made no
reply, but threw down a kind of knap&s;ack,
and drew forth &s;everal brace of birds. The
bag &s;ounded heavily as it fell to the ground,
and the glitter of &s;ome bright metal within
glanced on the eye of the Count, who now
&s;urveyed, with a more enquiring look, the
man, that held the knap&s;ack. He was a tall
robu&s;t figure, of a hard countenance, and
had &s;hort black hair, curling in his neck.
In&s;tead of the hunter's dre&s;s, he wore a faded
military uniform; &s;andals were laced on
his broad legs, and a kind of &s;hort trow&s;ers
hung from his wai&s;t. On his head he wore
a leathern cap, &s;omewhat re&s;embling in
<PB N="261" REF="263">
&s;hape an ancient Roman helmet; but the
brows that &s;cowled beneath it, would have
characterized tho&s;e of the barbarians, who
conquered Rome, rather than tho&s;e of a
Roman &s;oldier. The Count, at length,
turned away his eyes, and remained &s;ilent
and thoughtful, till, again rai&s;ing them, he
perceived a figure &s;tanding in an ob&s;cure
part of the hall, fixed in attentive gaze on
St. Foix, who was conver&s;ing with Blanche,
and did not ob&s;erve this; but the Count,
&s;oon after, &s;aw the &s;ame man looking over
the &s;houlder of the &s;oldier as attentively at
him&s;elf. He withdrew his eye, when that
of the Count met it, who felt mi&s;tru&s;t ga|thering
fa&s;t upon his mind, but feared to
betray it in his countenance, and, forcing
his features to a&s;&s;ume a &s;mile, addre&s;&s;ed
Blanche on &s;ome indifferent &s;ubject. When
he again looked round, he perceived, that
the &s;oldier and his companion were gone.</P>
<P>The man, who was called Jacques, now
returned from the &s;tone gallery. "A fire is
lighted there," &s;aid he, "and the birds are
<PB N="262" REF="264">
dre&s;&s;ing; the table too is &s;pread there, for
that place is warmer than this."</P>
<P>His companions approved of the removal,
and invited their gue&s;ts to follow to the
gallery, of whom Blanche appeared di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed,
and remained &s;eated, and St. Foix
looked at the Count, who &s;aid, he pre|ferred
the comfortable blaze of the fire he
was then near. The hunters, however,
commended the warmth of the other apart|ment,
and pre&s;&s;ed his removal with &s;uch
&s;eeming courte&s;y, that the Count, half
doubting, and half fearful of betraying his
doubts, con&s;ented to go. The long and
ruinous pa&s;&s;ages, through which they went,
&s;omewhat daunted him, but the thunder,
which now bur&s;t in loud peals above, made
it dangerous to quit this place of &s;helter,
and he forbore to provoke his conductors
by &s;hewing that he di&s;tru&s;ted them. The
hunters led the way, with a lamp; the
Count and St. Foix, who wi&s;hed to plea&s;e
their ho&s;ts by &s;ome in&s;tances of familiarity,
carried each a &s;eat, and Blanche followed,
<PB N="263" REF="265">
with faltering &s;teps. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on,
part of her dre&s;s caught on a nail in the
wall, and, while &s;he &s;topped, &s;omewhat
too &s;crupulou&s;ly, to di&s;engage it, the Count,
who was talking to St. Foix, and neither of
whom ob&s;erved the circum&s;tance, followed
their conductor round an abrupt angle of
the pa&s;&s;age, and Blanche was left behind in
darkne&s;s. The thunder prevented them
from hearing her call, but, having di&s;en|gaged
her dre&s;s, &s;he quickly followed, as &s;he
thought, the way they had taken. A light,
that glimmered at a di&s;tance, confirmed
this belief, and &s;he proceeded towards an
open door, whence it i&s;&s;ued, conjecturing
the room beyond to be the &s;tone gallery the
men had &s;poken of. Hearing voices as &s;he
advanced, &s;he pau&s;ed within a few paces of
the chamber, that &s;he might be certain
whether &s;he was right, and from thence, by
the light of a lamp, that hung from the
ceiling, ob&s;erved four men, &s;eated round a
table, over which they leaned in apparent
con&s;ultation. In one of them &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="264" REF="266">
the features of him, whom &s;he had
ob&s;erved, gazing at St. Foix, with &s;uch deep
attention; and who was now &s;peaking in
an earne&s;t, though re&s;trained voice, till, one
of his companions &s;eeming to oppo&s;e him,
they &s;poke together in a loud and har&s;her
tone. Blanche, alarmed by perceiving,
that neither her father, or St. Foix were
there, and terrified at the fierce countenances
and manners of the&s;e men, was turning ha&s;|tily
from the chamber, to pur&s;ue her &s;earch
of the gallery, when &s;he heard one of the
men &s;ay:</P>
<P>"Let all di&s;pute end here. Who talks
of danger? Follow my advice, and there
will be none&mdash;&s;ecure <HI>them,</HI> and the re&s;t are
an ea&s;y prey." Blanche, &s;truck with the&s;e
words, pau&s;ed a moment, to hear more.
"There is nothing to be got by the re&s;t,"
&s;aid one of his companions, "I am never
for blood when I can help it&mdash;di&s;patch the
two others and our bu&s;ine&s;s is done; the
re&s;t may go."</P>
<P>"May they &s;o?" exclaimed the fir&s;t ruffian,
<PB N="265" REF="267">
with a tremendous oath&mdash;"What! To
tell how we have di&s;po&s;ed of their ma&s;ters,
and to &s;end the king's troops to drag us to
the wheel! You was always a choice ad|vi&s;er&mdash;I
warrant we have not yet forgot
St. Thomas's eve la&s;t year."</P>
<P>Blanche's heart now &s;unk with horror.
Her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to retreat from the
door, but, when &s;he would have gone, her
trembling frame refu&s;ed to &s;upport her, and,
having tottered a few paces, to a more ob|&s;cure
part of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he was compelled
to li&s;ten to the dreadful councils of tho&s;e,
who, &s;he was no longer &s;uffered to doubt,
were banditti. In the next moment, &s;he
heard the following words, "Why you
would not murder the whole <HI>gang?</HI>"</P>
<P>"I warrant our lives are as good as theirs,"
replied his comrade. "If we don't kill them,
they will hang us: better they &s;hould die
than we be hanged."</P>
<P>"Better, better," cried his comrades.</P>
<P>"To commit murder, is a hopeful way of

of e&s;caping the gallows!" &s;aid the fir&s;t ruffian&mdash;"
many an hone&s;t fellow has run
his head into the noo&s;e that way, though."
There was a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments, dur|ing
which they appeared to be con&s;idering.</P>
<P>"Confound tho&s;e fellows," exclaimed
one of the robbers impatiently, "they
ought to have been here by this time; they
will come back pre&s;ently with the old &s;tory,
and no booty: if they were here, our bu&s;i|ne&s;s
would be plain and ea&s;y. I &s;ee we
&s;hall not be able to do the bu&s;ine&s;s to|night,
for our numbers are not equal to the
enemy, and in the morning they will be for
marching off, and how can we detain them
without force?"</P>
<P>"I have been thinking of a &s;cheme, that
will do," &s;aid one of his comrades: "if we
can di&s;patch the two chevaliers &s;ilently, it
will be ea&s;y to ma&s;ter the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"That's a plau&s;ible &s;cheme, in good
faith," &s;aid another with a &s;mile of &s;corn&mdash;"If
I can eat my way through the pri&s;on
wall, I &s;hall be at liberty!&mdash;How can we
di&s;patch them <HI>&s;ilently?"</HI></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="271">
"By poi&s;on," replied his companions.</P>
<P>"Well &s;aid! that will do," &s;aid the &s;e|cond
ruffian, "that will give a lingering
death too, and &s;atisfy my revenge. The&s;e
barons &s;hall take care how they again tempt
our vengeance."</P>
<P>"I knew the &s;on, the moment I &s;aw
him," &s;aid the man, whom Blanche had ob|&s;erved
gazing on St. Foix, "though he
does not know me; the father I had almo&s;t
forgotten."</P>
<P>"Well, you may &s;ay what you will,"
&s;aid the third ruffian, "but I don't believe
he is the Baron, and I am as likely to know
as any of you, for I was one of them, that
attacked him, with our brave lads, that &s;uffered."</P>
<P>"And was not I another?" &s;aid the fir&s;t
ruffian, "I tell you he is the Baron; but
what does it &s;ignify whether he is or not?&mdash;&s;hall
we let all this booty go out of our
hands? It is not often we have &s;uch luck as
this. While we run the chance of the
wheel for &s;muggling a few pounds of to|bacco,
<PB N="268" REF="272">
to cheat the king's manufactory, and
of breaking our necks down the precipices
in the chace of our food; and, now and
then, rob a brother &s;muggler, or a &s;trag|gling
pilgrim, of what &s;carcely repays us
the powder we fire at them, &s;hall we let &s;uch
a prize as this go? Why they have enough
about them to keep us for&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I am not for that, I am not for that,"
replied the third robber, "let us make the
mo&s;t of them: only, if this is the Baron, I
&s;hould like to have a fla&s;h the more at him,
for the &s;ake of our brave comrades, that he
brought to the gallows."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, &s;la&s;h as much as you will,"
rejoined the fir&s;t man, "but I tell you the
Baron is a taller man."</P>
<P>"Confound your quibbling," &s;aid the
&s;econd ruffian, "&s;hall we let them go or
not? If we &s;tay here much longer, they
will take the hint, and march off without
our leave. Let them be who they will,
they are rich, or why all tho&s;e &s;ervants?
Did you &s;ee the ring, he, you call the Baron,
<PB N="269" REF="273">
had on his finger?&mdash;it was diamond; but
he has not got it on now: he &s;aw me look|ing
at it, I warrant, and took it off."</P>
<P>"Aye, and then there is the picture; did
you &s;ee that? She has not taken that off,"
ob&s;erved the fir&s;t ruffian, "it hangs at her
neck; if it had not &s;parkled &s;o, I &s;hould not
have found it out, for it was almo&s;t hid by
her dre&s;s; tho&s;e are diamonds too, and a
rare many of them there mu&s;t be, to go
round &s;uch a large picture."</P>
<P>"But how are we to manage this bu&s;i|ne&s;s?"
&s;aid the &s;econd ruffian: "let us talk
of that, there is no fear of there being
booty enough, but how are we to &s;ecure
it?"</P>
<P>"Aye, aye," &s;aid his comrades, "let us
talk of that, and remember no time is to be
lo&s;t."</P>
<P>"I am &s;till for poi&s;on," ob&s;erved the
third, "but con&s;ider their number; why
there are nine or ten of them, and armed too;
when I &s;aw &s;o many at the gate, I was not
<PB N="270" REF="274">
for letting them in, you know, nor you
either."</P>
<P>"I thought they might be &s;ome of our
enemies," replied the &s;econd, "I did not &s;o
much mind numbers."</P>
<P>"But you mu&s;t mind them now," re|joined
his comrade, "or it will be wor&s;e
for you. We are not more than &s;ix, and
how can we ma&s;ter ten by open force? I
tell you we mu&s;t give &s;ome of them a do&s;e,
and the re&s;t may then be managed."</P>
<P>"I'll tell you a better way," rejoined the
other impatiently, "draw clo&s;er."</P>
<P>Blanche, who had li&s;tened to this conver|&s;ation,
in an agony, which it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
to de&s;cribe, could no longer di&s;tin|gui&s;h
what was &s;aid, for the ruffians now
&s;poke in lowered voices; but the hope, that
&s;he might &s;ave her friends from the plot, if
&s;he could find her way quickly to them,
&s;uddenly re-animated her &s;pirits, and lent
her &s;trength enough to turn her &s;teps in
&s;earch of the gallery. Terror, however,
<PB N="271" REF="275">
and darkne&s;s con&s;pired again&s;t her, and, hav|ing
moved a few yards, the feeble light, that
i&s;&s;ued from the chamber, no longer even
contended with the gloom, and, her foot
&s;tumbling over a &s;tep that cro&s;&s;ed the pa&s;|&s;age,
&s;he fell to the ground.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e &s;tartled the banditti, who be|came
&s;uddenly &s;ilent, and then all ru&s;hed to
the pa&s;&s;age, to examine whether any per&s;on
was there, who might have overheard their
councils, Blanche &s;aw them approaching,
and perceived their fierce and eager looks:
but, before &s;he could rai&s;e her&s;elf, they di&s;|covered
and &s;eized her, and, as they dragged
her towards the chamber they had quitted,
her &s;creams drew from them horrible threat|enings.</P>
<P>Having reached the room, they began to
con&s;ult what they &s;hould do with her. "Let
us fir&s;t know what &s;he has heard," &s;aid the
chief robber. "How long have you been in
the pa&s;&s;age, lady, and what brought you
there?"</P>
<P>"Let us fir&s;t &s;ecure that picture," &s;aid
<PB N="272" REF="276">
one of his comrades, approaching the trem|bling
Blanche. "Fair lady, by your leave
that picture is mine; come, &s;urrender it, or
I &s;hall &s;eize it."</P>
<P>Blanche, entreating their mercy, imme|diately
gave up the miniature, while another
of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her,
concerning what &s;he had overheard of their
conver&s;ation, when, her confu&s;ion and terror
too plainly telling what her tongue feared
to confe&s;s, the ruffians looked expre&s;&s;ively
upon one another, and two of them with|drew
to a remote part of the room, as if
to con&s;ult further.</P>
<P>"The&s;e are diamonds, by St. Peter!"
exclaimed the fellow, who had been exa|mining
the miniature, "and here is a very
pretty picture too, faith; as hand&s;ome a
young chevalier, as you would wi&s;h to &s;ee
by a &s;ummer's &s;un. Lady, this is your
&s;pou&s;e, I warrant, for it is the &s;park, that
was in your company ju&s;t now."</P>
<P>Blanche, &s;inking with terror, conjured
him to have pity on her, and, delivering
<PB N="273" REF="277">
him her pur&s;e, promi&s;ed to &s;ay nothing of
what had pa&s;&s;ed, if he would &s;uffer her to
return to her friends.</P>
<P>He &s;miled ironically, and was going to
reply, when his attention was called off by
a di&s;tant noi&s;e; and, while he li&s;tened, he
gra&s;ped the arm of Blanche more firmly, as
if he feared &s;he would e&s;cape from him, and
&s;he again &s;hrieked for help.</P>
<P>The approaching &s;ounds called the ruf|fians
from the other part of the chamber.
"We are betrayed," &s;aid they; "but let
us li&s;ten a moment, perhaps it is only our
comrades come in from the mountains, and
if &s;o, our work is &s;ure; li&s;ten!"</P>
<P>A di&s;tant di&s;charge of &s;hot confirmed this
&s;uppo&s;ition for a moment, but, in the next,
the former &s;ounds drawing nearer, the cla&s;h|ing
of &s;words, mingled with the voices of
loud contention and with heavy groans,
were di&s;tingui&s;hed in the avenue leading to
the chamber. While the ruffians prepared
their arms, they heard them&s;elves called by
&s;ome of their comrades afar off, and then a
<PB N="274" REF="278">
&s;hrill horn was &s;ounded without the for|tre&s;s,
a &s;ignal, it appeared, they too well un|der&s;tood;
for three of them, leaving the
Lady Blanche to the care of the fourth,
in&s;tantly ru&s;hed from the chamber.</P>
<P>While Blanche, trembling, and nearly
fainting, was &s;upplicating for relea&s;e, &s;he
heard amid the tumult, that approached, the
voice of St. Foix, and &s;he had &s;carcely re|newed
her &s;hriek, when the door of the room
was thrown open, and he appeared, much
disfigured with blood, and pur&s;ued by &s;e|veral
ruffians. Blanche neither &s;aw, or heard
any more; her head &s;wam, her &s;ight failed,
and &s;he became &s;en&s;ele&s;s in the arms of the
robber, who had detained her.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered, &s;he perceived, by
the gloomy light, that trembled round
her, that &s;he was in the &s;ame chamber,
but neither the Count, St. Foix, or any
other per&s;on appeared, and &s;he continued,
for &s;ome time, entirely &s;till, and nearly in
a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction. But, the dreadful
images of the pa&s;t returning, &s;he endea|voured
<PB N="275" REF="279">
to rai&s;e her&s;elf, that &s;he might &s;eek
her friends, when a &s;ullen groan, at a little
di&s;tance, reminded her of St. Foix, and of
the condition, in which &s;he had &s;een him
enter this room; then, &s;tarting from the
floor, by a &s;udden effort of horror, &s;he ad|vanced
to the place whence the &s;ound had
proceeded, where a body was lying &s;tretched
upon the pavement, and where, by the glim|mering
light of a lamp, &s;he di&s;covered the
pale and disfigured countenance of St. Foix.
Her horrors at that moment, may be ea&s;ily
imagined. He was &s;peechle&s;s; his eyes
were half clo&s;ed, and, on the hand, which
&s;he gra&s;ped in the agony of de&s;pair, cold
damps had &s;ettled. While &s;he vainly re|peated
his name, and called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
&s;teps approached, and a per&s;on entered the
chamber, who, &s;he &s;oon perceived, was
not the Count, her father; but, what was
her a&s;toni&s;hment, when, &s;upplicating him
to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to St. Foix, &s;he di&s;|covered
Ludovico! He &s;carcely pau&s;ed to
recogni&s;e her, but immediately bound up
<PB N="276" REF="280">
the wounds of the Chevalier, and, perceive|ing,
that he had fainted probably from lo&s;s
of blood, ran for water; but he had been
ab&s;ent only a few moments, when Blanche
heard other &s;teps approaching, and, while
&s;he was almo&s;t frantic with apprehen|&s;ion
of the ruffians, the light of a torch
fla&s;hed upon the walls, and then Count De
Villefort appeared, with an affrighted coun|tenance,
and breathle&s;s with impatience,
calling upon his daughter. At the &s;ound of
his voice, &s;he ro&s;e, and ran to his arms,
while he letting fall the bloody &s;word he
held, pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om in a tran&s;port
of gratitude and joy, and then ha&s;tily en|quired
for St. Foix, who now gave &s;ome
&s;igns of life. Ludovico &s;oon after returning
with water and brandy, the former was ap|plied
to his lips, and the latter to his tem|ples
and hands, and Blanche, at length, &s;aw
him unclo&s;e his eyes, and then heard him
enquire for her; but the joy &s;he felt, on
this occa&s;ion, was interrupted by new
alarms, when Ludovico &s;aid it would be
<PB N="277" REF="281">
nece&s;&s;ary to remove Mon&s;. St. Foix imme|diately,
and added, "The banditti, that
are out, my Lord, were expected home, an
hour ago, and they will certainly find us, if
we delay. That &s;hrill horn, they know,
is never &s;ounded by their comrades but on
mo&s;t de&s;perate occa&s;ions, and it echoes
among the mountains for many leagues
round. I have known them brought home
by its &s;ound even from the Pied de Meli|cant.
Is any body &s;tanding watch at the
great gate, my Lord?"</P>
<P>"Nobody," replied the Count; "the
re&s;t of my people are now &s;cattered
about, I &s;carcely know where. Go, Lu|dovico,
collect them together, and look
out your&s;elf, and li&s;ten if you hear the feet
of mules."</P>
<P>Ludovico then hurried away, and the
Count con&s;ulted as to the means of re|moving
St. Foix, who could not have
borne the motion of a mule, even if his
&s;trength would have &s;upported him in the
&s;addle.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="282">
While the Count was telling, that the ban|ditti,
whom they had found in the fort, were
&s;ecured in the dungeon, Blanche ob&s;erved
that he was him&s;elf wounded, and that his
left arm was entirely u&s;ele&s;s; but he &s;miled
at her anxiety, a&s;&s;uring her the wound was
trifling.</P>
<P>The Count's &s;ervants, except two who
kept watch at the gate, now appeared, and,
&s;oon after, Ludovico. "I think I hear
mules coming along the glen, my Lord,"
&s;aid he, "but the roaring of the torrent be|low
will not let me be certain; however, I
have brought what will &s;erve the Chevalier,"
he added, &s;hewing a bear's &s;kin, fa&s;tened to
a couple of long poles, which had been
adapted for the purpo&s;e of bringing home &s;uch
of the banditti as happened to be wounded
in their encounters. Ludovico &s;pread it
on the ground, and, placing the &s;kins of
&s;everal goats upon it, made a kind of bed,
into which the Chevalier, who was however
now much revived, was gently lifted; and,
the poles being rai&s;ed upon the &s;houlders of
<PB N="279" REF="283">
the guides, who&s;e footing among the&s;e &s;teeps
could be&s;t be depended upon, he was borne
along with an ea&s;y motion. Some of the
Count's &s;ervants were al&s;o wounded&mdash;but
not materially, and, their wounds being
bound up, they now followed to the great
gate. As they pa&s;&s;ed along the hall, a loud
tumult was heard at &s;ome di&s;tance, and
Blanche was terrified. "It is only tho&s;e
villains in the dungeon, my Lady," &s;aid
Ludovico. "They &s;eem to be bur&s;ting it
open," &s;aid the Count. "No, my Lord,"
replied Ludovico, "it has an iron door;
we have nothing to fear from them; but
let me go fir&s;t, and look out
from the rampart."</P>
<P>They quickly followed him, and found
their mules brow&s;ing before the gates, where
the party li&s;tened anxiously, but heard no
&s;ound, except that of the torrent below and
of the early breeze, &s;ighing among the
branches of the old oak, that grew in the
court; and they were now glad to perceive
the fir&s;t tints of dawn over the mountain|tops.
<PB N="280" REF="284">
When they had mounted their mules,
Ludovico, undertaking to be their guide,
led them by an ea&s;ier path, than that by
which they had formerly a&s;cended, into the
glen. "We mu&s;t avoid that valley to the
ea&s;t, my Lord," &s;aid he, "or we may meet
the banditti; they went out that way in the
morning."</P>
<P>The travellers, &s;oon after, quitted this
glen, and found them&s;elves in a narrow valley
that &s;tretched towards the north-we&s;t. The
morning light upon the mountains now
&s;trengthened fa&s;t, and gradually di&s;covered
the green hillocks, that &s;kirted the winding
feet of the cliffs, tufted with cork tree,
and ever-green oak. The thunder-clouds
being di&s;per&s;ed, had left the &s;ky perfectly
&s;erene, and Blanche was revived by the fre&s;h
breeze, and by the view of verdure, which
the late rain had brightened. Soon after,
the &s;un aro&s;e, when the dripping rocks,
with, the &s;hrubs. that fringed their &s;ummits,
and many a turfy &s;lope below, &s;parkled in
his rays. A wreath of mi&s;t was &s;een, float|ing
<PB N="281" REF="285">
along the extremity of the valley, but
the gale bore it before the travellers, and
the &s;un-beams gradually drew it up towards
the &s;ummit of the mountains. They had
proceeded about a league, when, St. Foix
having complained of extreme faintne&s;s,
they &s;topped to give him refre&s;hment, and,
that the men, who bore him, might re&s;t.
Ludovico had brought from the fort &s;ome
fla&s;ks of rich Spani&s;h wine, which now
proved a reviving cordial not only to St.
Foix but to the whole party, though to him
it gave only temporary relief, for it fed the
fever, that burned in his veins, and he could
neither di&s;gui&s;e in his countenance the an|gui&s;h
he &s;uffered, or &s;uppre&s;s the wi&s;h, that
he was arrived at the inn, where they had
de&s;igned to pa&s;s the preceding night.</P>
<P>While they thus repo&s;ed them&s;elves under
the &s;hade of the dark green pines, the Count
de&s;ired Ludovico to explain &s;hortly, by what
means he had di&s;appeared from the north
apartment, how he came into the hands of
the banditti, and how he had contributed
<PB N="282" REF="286">
&s;o e&s;&s;entially to &s;erve him and his family,
for to him he ju&s;tly attributed their pre&s;ent
deliverance. Ludovico was going to obey
him, when &s;uddenly they heard the echo of
a pi&s;tol-&s;hot, from the way they had pa&s;&s;ed,
and they ro&s;e in alarm, ha&s;tily to pur&s;ue
their route.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY, mean while, was &s;till &s;uffering
anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt; but
There&s;a, having, at length, found a per&s;on,
whom &s;he could entru&s;t on her errand to the
&s;teward, informed her, that the me&s;&s;enger
would return on the following day; and
Emily promi&s;ed to be at the cottage,
There&s;a being too lame to attend her.</P>
<P>In the evening, therefore, Emily &s;et out
alone for the cottage, with a melancholy
foreboding, concerning Valancourt, while,
perhaps, the gloom of the hour might con|tribute
to depre&s;s her &s;pirits. It was a grey
autumnal evening towards the clo&s;e of the
&s;ea&s;on; heavy mi&s;ts partially ob&s;cured the
mountains, and a chilling breeze, that &s;igh|ed
<PB N="284" REF="288">
among the beech woods, &s;trewed her path
with &s;ome of their la&s;t yellow leaves. The&s;e,
circling in the bla&s;t and foretelling the
death of the year, gave an image of de&s;ola|tion
to her mind, and, in her fancy, &s;eemed
to announce the death of Valancourt. Of
this &s;he had, indeed, more than once &s;o
&s;trong a pre&s;entiment, that &s;he was on the
point of returning home, feeling her&s;elf un|equal
to an encounter with the certainty &s;he
anticipated, but, contending with her emo|tions,
&s;he &s;o far commanded them, as to be
able to proceed.</P>
<P>While &s;he walked mournfully on, gazing
on the long volumes, of vapour, that poured
upon the &s;ky and watching the &s;wallows,
to&s;&s;ed along the wind, now di&s;appearing
among tempe&s;tuous clouds, and then emerg|ing,
for a moment, in circles upon the
calmer air, the afflictions and vici&s;&s;itudes of
her late life &s;eemed pourtrayed in the&s;e
fleeting images;&mdash;thus had &s;he been to&s;&s;ed
upon the &s;tormy &s;ea of misfortune for the
la&s;t year, with but &s;hort intervals of peace,
<PB N="285" REF="289">
if peace that could be called, which was
only the delay of evils. And now, when
&s;he had e&s;caped from &s;o many dangers, was
become independent of the will of tho&s;e,
who had oppre&s;&s;ed her, and found her&s;elf
mi&s;tre&s;s of a large fortune, now, when &s;he
might rea&s;onably have expected happine&s;s,
&s;he perceived that &s;he was as di&s;tant from it
as ever. She would have accu&s;ed her&s;elf of
weakne&s;s and ingratitude in thus &s;uffering a
&s;en&s;e of the various ble&s;&s;ings &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to
be overcome by that of a &s;ingle misfortune,
had this misfortune affected her&s;elf alone;
but, when she had wept for Valancourt
even as living, tears of compa&s;&s;ion had
mingled with tho&s;e of regret, and while &s;he
lamented a human being degraded to vice,
and con&s;equently to mi&s;ery, rea&s;on and hu|manity
claimed the&s;e tears, and fortitude
had not yet taught her to &s;eparate them
from tho&s;e of love; in the pre&s;ent moments,
however, it was not the certainty of his
guilt, but the apprehen&s;ion of his death
(of a death al&s;o, to which &s;he her&s;elf, how|ever
<PB N="286" REF="290">
innocently, appeared to have been in
&s;ome degree in&s;trumental) that oppre&s;&s;ed
her. This fear increa&s;ed, as the means of
certainty concerning it approached; and,
when &s;he came within view of There&s;a's
cottage, &s;he was &s;o much di&s;ordered, and
her re&s;olution failed her &s;o entirely, that,
unable to proceed, &s;he re&s;ted on a bank,
be&s;ide her path; where, as &s;he fat, the
wind that groaned &s;ullenly among the lofty
branches above, &s;eemed to her melancholy
imagination to bear the founds of di&s;tant la|mentation,
and, in the pau&s;es of the gu&s;t,
&s;he &s;till fancied &s;he heard the feeble and far-off
notes of di&s;tre&s;s. Attention convinced
her, that this was no more than fancy; but
the increa&s;ing gloom, which &s;eemed the &s;ud|den
clo&s;e of day, &s;oon warned her to depart,
and, with faltering &s;teps, &s;he again moved
toward the cottage. Through the ca&s;ement
appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire,
and There&s;a, who had ob&s;erved Emily ap|proaching,
was already at the door to re|ceive
her.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="291">
"It is a cold evening, madam," &s;aid
&s;he, "&s;torms are coming on, and I thought
you would like a fire. Do take this chair
by the hearth."</P>
<P>Emily, thanking her for this con&s;ideration,
&s;at down, and then, looking in her face,
on which the wood fire threw a gleam, &s;he
was &s;truck with its expre&s;&s;ion, and, unable
to &s;peak, &s;unk back in her chair with a
countenance &s;o full of woe, that There&s;a
in&s;tantly comprehended the occa&s;ion of it,
but &s;he remained &s;ilent. "Ah!" &s;aid Emi|ly,
at length, "it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to
a&s;k the re&s;ult of your enquiry, your &s;ilence,
and that look, &s;ufficiently explain it;&mdash;he
is dead!"</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear young lady," replied
There&s;a, while tears filled her eyes, "this
world is made up of trouble! the rich have
their &s;hare as well as the poor! But we
mu&s;t all endeavour to bear what Heaven
plea&s;es."</P>
<P>"He is dead then!"&mdash;interrupted Emily&mdash;"Valancourt
is dead!"</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="292">
"A-well-a-day! I fear he is," replied
There&s;a.</P>
<P>"You fear!" &s;aid Emily, "do you only
fear?"</P>
<P>"Alas! yes, Madam, I fear he is!
neither the &s;teward, or any of the Epourville
family, have heard of him &s;ince he left
Languedoc, and the Count is in great afflic|tion
about him, for he &s;ays he was always
punctual in writing, but that now he has
not received a line from him, &s;ince he left
Languedoc; he appointed to be at home,
three weeks ago, but he has neither come,
or written, and they fear &s;ome accident has
befallen him. Alas! that ever I &s;hould
live to cry for his death! I am old, and
might have died without being mi&s;&s;ed, but
he"&mdash;Emily was faint, and a&s;ked for
&s;ome water, and There&s;a, alarmed by the
voice, in which &s;he &s;poke, ha&s;tened to her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, while &s;he held the water to
Emily's lips, continued, "My dear young
mi&s;tre&s;s do not take it &s;o to heart; the
<PB N="289" REF="293">
Chevalier may be alive and well, for all this;
let us hope the be&s;t!"</P>
<P>"O no! I cannot hope," &s;aid Emily,
"I am acquainted with circum&s;tances, that
will not &s;uffer me to hope. I am &s;ome|what
better now, and can hear what you
have to &s;ay. Tell me, I entreat, the parti|culars
of what you know."</P>
<P>"Stay till you are a little better, made-moi&s;elle,
you look &s;adly!"</P>
<P>"O no, There&s;a, tell me all, while I have
the power to hear it," &s;aid Emily, "tell
me all, I conjure you!"</P>
<P>"Well, madam, I will then; but the
&s;teward did not &s;ay much, for Richard &s;ays
he &s;eemed &s;hy of talking about Mon&s;. Va|lancourt,
and what he gathered was from
Gabriel, one of the &s;ervants, who &s;aid he
had heard it from my lord's gentleman."</P>
<P>"What did he hear?" said Emily.</P>
<P>"Why, madam, Richard has but a bad
memory, and could not remember half of
it, and, if I had not a&s;ked him a great
many que&s;tions, I &s;hould have; heard little
<PB N="290" REF="294">
indeed. But he says that Gabriel &s;aid,
that he and all the other &s;ervants were in
great trouble about M. Valancourt, for
that he was &s;uch a kind young gentleman,
they all loved him, as well as if he had
been their own brother&mdash;and now, to think
what was become of him! For he u&s;ed to
be &s;o courteous to them all, and, if any of
them had been in fault, M. Valancourt
was the fir&s;t to per&s;uade my lord to forgive
them. And then, if any poor family was
in di&s;tre&s;s, M. Valancourt was the fir&s;t, too,
to relieve them, though &s;ome folks, not a
great way off, could have afforded that
much better than he. And then, &s;aid Ga|briel,
he was &s;o gentle to every body, and,
for all he had &s;uch a noble look with him,
he never would command, and call about
him, as &s;ome of your quality people do,
and we never minded him the le&s;s for that.
Nay, &s;ays Gabriel, for that matter, we
minded him the more, and would all have
run to obey him at a word, &s;ooner than if
&s;ome folks had told us what to do at full
<PB N="291" REF="295">
length; aye, and were more afraid of di&s;|plea&s;ing
him, too, than of them, that u&s;ed
rough words to us."</P>
<P>Emily, who no longer con&s;idered it to
be dangerous to Men to prai&s;e, be&s;towed
on Valancourt, did not attempt to interrupt
There&s;a, but &s;at, attentive to her words,
though almo&s;t overwhelmed with grief.
"My Lord," continued There&s;a, "frets
about M. Valancourt &s;adly, and the more,
becau&s;e, they &s;ay, he had been rather har&s;h
again&s;t him lately. Gabriel &s;ays he had it
from my Lord's valet, that M. Valancourt
had <HI>comported</HI> him&s;elf wildly at Paris, and
had &s;pent a great deal of money, more a
great deal than my Lord liked, for he loves
money better than M. Valancourt, who had
been led a&s;tray &s;adly. Nay, for that mat|ter,
M. Valancourt had been put into pri|&s;on
at Paris, and my Lord, &s;ays Gabriel,
refu&s;ed to take him out, and &s;aid he de|&s;erved
to &s;uffer; and, when old Gregoire,
the butler, heard of this, he actually bought
a walking-&s;tick to take with him to Paris,
<PB N="292" REF="296">
to vi&s;it his young ma&s;ter; but the next
thing we hear is, that M. Valancourt is
coming home. O, it was a joyful day
when he came; but he was &s;adly altered,
and my Lord looked very cool upon him,
and he was very &s;ad, indeed. And, &s;oon
after, he went away again into Languedoc,
and, &s;ince that time, we have never &s;een
him."</P>
<P>There&s;a pau&s;ed, and Emily, &s;ighing deep|ly,
remained with her eyes fixed upon the
floor, without &s;peaking. After a long
pau&s;e, &s;he enquired what further There&s;a
had heard. "Yet why &s;hould I a&s;k?" &s;he
added; "what you have already told is
too much. O Valancourt! thou art gone&mdash;forever
gone! and I&mdash;I have murdered
thee!" The&s;e words, and the countenance
of de&s;pair which accompanied them, alarmed
There&s;a, who began to fear, that the &s;hock
of the intelligence Emily had ju&s;t received,
had affected her &s;en&s;es. "My dear young
lady, be compo&s;ed," &s;aid &s;he, "and do not
&s;ay &s;uch frightful words. You murder
<PB N="293" REF="297">
M. Valancourt,&mdash;dear heart!" Emily re|plied
only by a heavy &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Dear lady, it breaks my heart to &s;ee
you look &s;o," &s;aid There&s;a, "do not &s;it
with your eyes upon the ground, and all
&s;o pale and melancholy; it frightens me to
&s;ee you." Emily was &s;till &s;ilent, and did,
not appear to hear any thing that was &s;aid
to her. "Be&s;ides, mademoi&s;elle," con|tinued.
There&s;a, "M. Valancourt may be alive
and merry yet, for what we know."</P>
<P>At the mention of his name, Emily
rai&s;ed her eyes, and fixed them, in a wild
gaze, upon There&s;a, as if &s;he was endea|vouring
to under&s;tand what had been &s;aid.
"Aye, my dear lady," &s;aid There&s;a, mi&s;|taking
the meaning of this con&s;iderate air,
"M. Valancourt may be alive and merry
yet."</P>
<P>On the repetition of the&s;e words, Emily
comprehended their import, but, in&s;tead of
producing the effect intended, they &s;eemed
only to heighten her di&s;tre&s;s. She ro&s;e ha&s;|tily
from her chair, paced the little room,
<PB N="294" REF="298">
with quick &s;teps, and, often &s;ighing deep|ly,
cla&s;ped her hands, and &s;huddered.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, There&s;a, with &s;imple, but
hone&s;t affection, endeavoured to comfort
her; put more wood on the fire, &s;tirred it
up into a brighter blaze, &s;wept the hearth,
&s;et the chair, which Emily had left, in a
warmer &s;ituation, and then drew forth from
a cupboard a fla&s;k of wine. "It is a
&s;tormy night, madam," &s;aid &s;he, "and
blows cold&mdash;do come nearer the fire, and
take a gla&s;s of this wine; it will comfort
you, as it has done me, often and often, for
it is not &s;uch wine as one gets every day;
it is rich Languedoc, and the la&s;t of &s;ix
fla&s;ks that M. Valancourt &s;ent me, the
night before he left Ga&s;cony for Paris.
They have &s;erved me, ever &s;ince, as cor|dials,
and I never drink it, but I think of
him, and what kind words he &s;aid to me
when he gave them. There&s;a, &s;ays he, you
are not young now, and &s;hould have a gla&s;s
of good wine, now and then. I will &s;end
you a few fla&s;ks, and, when you taste them,
<PB N="295" REF="299">
you will &s;ometimes remember me your
friend. Yes&mdash;tho&s;e were his very words&mdash;me
your friend!" Emily &s;till paced the
room, without feeming to hear what The|re&s;a
&s;aid, who continued &s;peaking. "And
I have remembered him, often enough,
poor young gentleman!&mdash;for he gave me
this roof for a &s;helter, and that, which has
&s;upported me. Ah! he is in heaven, with
my ble&s;&s;ed matter, if ever saint was!"</P>
<P>There&s;a's voice faltered; &s;he wept, and
&s;et down the fla&s;k, unable to pour out the
wine. Her grief &s;eemed to recall Emily
from her own, who went towards her, but
then &s;topped, and, having gazed on her,
for a moment, turned &s;uddenly away, as if
overwhelmed by the reflection, that it was
Valancourt, whom There&s;a lamented.</P>
<P>While &s;he yet paced the room, the &s;till,
&s;oft note of an oboe, or flute, was heard min|gling
with the bla&s;t, the &s;weetne&s;s of which
affected Emily's &s;pirits; &s;he pau&s;ed a mo|ment
in attention; the tender tones, as
they &s;welled along the wind, till they were
<PB N="296" REF="300">
lo&s;t again in the ruder gu&s;t, came with a
plaintivene&s;s, that touched her heart, and the
melted into tears.</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid There&s;a, drying her eyes,
"there is Richard, our neighbour's &s;on,
playing on the oboe; it is &s;ad enough, to
hear &s;uch &s;weet mu&s;ic now." Emily con|tinued
to weep, without replying. "He
often plays of an evening," added There&s;a,
"and, &s;ometimes, the young folks dance to
the &s;ound of his oboe. But, dear young lady!
do not cry &s;o; and pray take a gla&s;s of this
wine," continued &s;he, pouring &s;ome into a
gla&s;s, and handing it to Emily, who reluc|tantly
took it.</P>
<P>"Ta&s;te it for M. Valancourt's &s;ake,"
&s;aid There&s;a, as Emily lifted the gla&s;s to
her lips, "for he gave it me, you know,
madam." Emily's hand trembled, and &s;he
&s;pilt the wine as &s;he withdrew it from her
lips. "For who&s;e &s;ake!&mdash;who gave the
wine?" &s;aid &s;he in a faltering voice. "M.
Valancourt, dear lady. I knew you would
be plea&s;ed with it. It is the la&s;t fla&s;k I
have left."</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="301">
Emily &s;et the wine upon the table, and
bur&s;t into tears, while There&s;a, di&s;appointed
and alarmed, tried to comfort her; but &s;he
only waved her hand, entreated &s;he might
be left alone, and wept the more.</P>
<P>A knock at the cottage door prevented
There&s;a from immediately obeying her mi&s;|tre&s;s,
and &s;he was going to open it, when
Emily, checking her, reque&s;ted &s;he would
not admit any per&s;on; but, afterwards, recol|lecting,
that &s;he had ordered her &s;ervant to
attend her home, &s;he &s;aid it was only Phi|lippe,
and endeavoured to re&s;train her tears,
while There&s;a opened the door.</P>
<P>A voice, that &s;poke without, drew Emi|ly's
attention. She li&s;tened, turned her eyes
to the door, when a per&s;on now appeared,
and immediately a bright gleam, that fla&s;hed
from the fire, di&s;covered&mdash;Valancourt!</P>
<P>Emily, on perceiving him, &s;tarted from
her chair, trembled, and, &s;inking into it
again, became in&s;en&s;ible to all around her.</P>
<P>A &s;cream from There&s;a now told, that &s;he
knew Valancourt, whom her imperfect &s;ight,
<PB N="298" REF="302">
and the du&s;kine&s;s of the place had prevented
her from immediately recollecting; but his
attention was immediately called from her
to the per&s;on, whom he &s;aw, falling from a
chair near the fire; and, ha&s;tening to her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance,&mdash;he perceived, that he was &s;up|porting
Emily! The various emotions, that
&s;eized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting
with her, from whom he had believed he
had parted for ever, and on beholding her
pale and lifele&s;s in his arms&mdash;may, per|haps,
be imagined, though they could nei|ther
be then expre&s;&s;ed, or now de&s;cribed,
any more than Emily's &s;en&s;ations, when, at
length, &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, and, looking
up, again &s;aw Valancourt. The inten&s;e an|xiety,
with which he regarded her, was in|&s;tantly
changed to an expre&s;&s;ion of mingled
joy and tenderne&s;s, as his eye met hers, and
he perceived, that &s;he was reviving. But
he could only exclaim, "Emily!" as he
&s;ilently watched her recovery, while &s;he
averted her eye, and feebly attempted to
withdraw her hand; but, in the&s;e the fir&s;t
<PB N="299" REF="303">
moments, which &s;ucceeded to the pangs
his &s;uppo&s;ed death had occa&s;ioned her,
&s;he forgot every fault, which had formerly
claimed indignation, and beholding Valan|court
&s;uch as he appeared, when he won her
early affection, &s;he experienced emotions of
only tenderne&s;s and joy&punc; This, alas! was
but the &s;un&s;hine of a few &s;hort moments;
recollections ro&s;e, like clouds, upon her
mind, and, darkening the illu&s;ive image,
that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, &s;he again beheld Valan|court,
degraded&mdash;Valancourt unworthy of
the e&s;teem and tenderne&s;s &s;he had once be|&s;towed
upon him; her &s;pirits faltered, and,
withdrawing her hand, &s;he turned from
him to conceal her grief, while he, yet
more embarra&s;&s;ed and agitated, remained
&s;ilent.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of what &s;he owed to her&s;elf re|&s;trained
her tears, and taught her &s;oon to
overcome, in &s;ome degree, the emotions of
mingled joy and &s;orrow, that contended at
her heart, as &s;he ro&s;e, and, having thanked
him for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given her, bade
<PB N="300" REF="304">
There&s;a good evening. As &s;he was leaving
the cottage, Valancourt, who &s;eemed &s;ud|denly
awakened as from a dream, entreated,
in a voice, that pleaded powerfully for com|pa&s;&s;ion,
a few moments attention. Emily's
heart, perhaps, pleaded as powerfully, but
&s;he had re&s;olution enough to re&s;i&s;t both,
together with the clamorous entreaties of
There&s;a, that &s;he would not venture home
alone in the dark, and had already opened
the cottage door, when the pelting &s;torm
compelled her to obey their reque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Silent and embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;he returned to
the fire, while Valancourt, with increa&s;ing
agitation, paced the room, as if he wi&s;hed,
yet feared, to &s;peak, and There&s;a expre&s;&s;ed
without re&s;traint her joy and wonder upon
&s;eeing him.</P>
<P>"Dear heart! &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "I never
was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed and overjoyed in my life.
We were in great tribulation before you
came, for we thought you was dead, and
were talking, and lamenting about you, ju&s;t
when you knocked at the door. My young
<PB N="301" REF="305">
mi&s;tre&s;s there was crying, fit to break her
heart&mdash;"</P>
<P>Emily looked with much di&s;plea&s;ure at
There&s;a, but, before &s;he could &s;peak, Va|lancourt,
unable to repre&s;s the emotion,
which There&s;a's imprudent di&s;covery occa|&s;ioned,
exclaimed, "O my Emily! am I
then &s;till dear to you! Did you, indeed,
honour me with a thought&mdash;a tear? O
heavens! you weep&mdash;you weep now!"</P>
<P>"There&s;a, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, with a re|&s;erved
air, and trying to conquer her tears,
"has rea&s;on to remember you with grati|tude,
and &s;he was concerned, becau&s;e &s;he
had not lately heard of you. Allow me to
thank you for the kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn
her, and to &s;ay, that, &s;ince I am now upon
the &s;pot, &s;he mu&s;t not be further indebted
to you."</P>
<P>"Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt, no longer
ma&s;ter of his emotions, "is it thus you
meet him, whom once you meant to honour
with your hand&mdash;thus you meet him, who
has loved you&mdash;&s;uffered for you?&mdash;Yet what
<PB N="302" REF="306">
do I &s;ay? Pardon me, pardon me, made|moi&s;elle
St. Aubert, I know not what I ut|ter.
I have no longer any claim upon your
Remembrance&mdash;I have forfeited every pre|ten&s;ion
to your e&s;teem, your love. Yes!
let me not forget, that I once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your
affections, though to know that I have lo&s;t
them, is my &s;evere&s;t affiction. Affliction&mdash;do
I call it!&mdash;that is a term of mildne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Dear heart!" &s;aid There&s;a, preventing
Emily from replying, "talk of once having
her affections! Why, my dear young lady
loves you now, better than &s;he does any
body in the whole world, though &s;he pre|tends
to deny it."</P>
<P>"This is in&s;upportable!" &s;aid Emily;
"There&s;a, you know not what you &s;ay. Sir,
if you re&s;pect my tranquillity, you will &s;pare
me from the continuance of this di&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>"I do re&s;pect your tranquillity too much,
voluntarily to interrupt it," replied Valan|court,
in who&s;e bo&s;om pride now contended
with tenderne&s;s; "and will not be a volun|tary
intruder. I would have entreated a few
<PB N="303" REF="307">
moments attention&mdash;yet I know not for
what purpo&s;e. You have cea&s;ed to e&s;teem
me, and to recount to you my &s;ufferings
will degrade me more, without exciting even
your pity. Yet I have been, O Emily! I
am indeed very wretched!" added Valan|court,
in a voice, that &s;oftened from &s;olem|nity
into grief.</P>
<P>"What! is my dear young ma&s;ter going
out in all this rain!" &s;aid There&s;a. "No, he
&s;hall not &s;tir a &s;tep. Dear! dear! to fee
how gentlefolks can afford to throw away
their happine&s;s! Now, if you were poor
people, there would be none of this. To
talk of unworthine&s;s, and not caring about
one another, when I know there are not
&s;uch a kind-hearted lady and gentleman in
the whole province, nor any that love one
another half &s;o well, if the truth was &s;poken!"</P>
<P>Emily, in extreme vexation, now ro&s;e
from her chair, "I mu&s;t be gone," &s;aid &s;he,
"the &s;torm is over."</P>
<P>"Stay, Emily, &s;tay, mademoi&s;elle St. Au|bert!"
<PB N="304" REF="308">
&s;aid Valancourt, &s;ummoning all his
re&s;olution, "I will no longer di&s;tre&s;s you
by my pre&s;ence. Forgive me, that I did
not &s;ooner obey you, and, if you can, &s;ome|times,
pity one, who, in lo&s;ing you&mdash;has
lo&s;t all hope of peace! May you be happy,
Emily, however wretched I remain, happy
as my fonde&s;t wi&s;h would have you!"</P>
<P>His voice faltered with the la&s;t words,
and his countenance changed, while, with
a look of ineffable tenderne&s;s and grief, he
gazed upon her for an in&s;tant, and then
quitted the cottage.</P>
<P>"Dear heart! dear heart!" cried The|re&s;a,
following him to the door, "why,
Mon&s;ieur Valancourt! how it rains! What
a night is this to turn him out in! Why it
will give him his death; and it was but now
you was crying, mademoi&s;elle, becau&s;e he
was dead. Well! young ladies do change
their mind in a minute, as one may &s;ay!"</P>
<P>Emily made no reply, for &s;he heard not
what was &s;aid, while, lo&s;t in &s;orrow and
thought, &s;he remained in her chair by the
<PB N="305" REF="309">
fire, with her eyes fixed, and the image of
Valancourt &s;till before them.</P>
<P>"M. Valancourt is &s;adly altered! Ma|dam,"
&s;aid There&s;a; "he looks &s;o thin to
what he u&s;ed to do, and &s;o melancholy, and
then he wears his arm in a &s;ling."</P>
<P>Emily rai&s;ed her eyes at the&s;e words, for
&s;he had not ob&s;erved this la&s;t circum&s;tance,
and &s;he now did not doubt, that Valancourt
had received the &s;hot of her gardener at Tho|lou&s;e;
with this conviction her pity for him
returning, &s;he blamed her&s;elf for having oc|ca&s;ioned
him to leave the cottage, during the
&s;torm.</P>
<P>Soon after her &s;ervants arrived with the
carriage, and Emily, having cen&s;ured The|re&s;a
for her thoughtle&s;s conver&s;ation to Va|lancourt,
and &s;trictly charging her never to
repeat any hints of the &s;ame kind to him,
withdrew to her home, thoughtful and di&s;|con&s;olate.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Valancourt had returned to a
little inn of the village, whither he had
arrived only a few moments before his
vi&s;it to There&s;a's cottage, on the way
<PB N="306" REF="310">
from Tholou&s;e to the chateau of the Count
de Duvarney, where he had not been &s;ince
he bade adieu to Emily at Chateau-le-Blanc,
in the neighbourhood of which he
had lingered for a con&s;iderable time, un|able
to &s;ummon re&s;olution enough to quit
a place, that contained the object mo&s;t
dear to his heart. There were times, in|deed,
when grief and de&s;pair urged him to
appear again before Emily, and, regard|le&s;s
of his ruined circum&s;tances, to renew his
&s;uit. Pride, however, and the tenderne&s;s
of his affection, which could not long en|dure
the thought of involving her in his mi&s;|fortunes,
at length, &s;o far triumphed over
pa&s;&s;ion, that he relinqui&s;hed this de&s;perate
de&s;ign, and quitted Chateau-le-Blanc. But
&s;till his fancy wandered among the &s;cenes,
which had witne&s;&s;ed his early love, and, on
his way to Ga&s;cony, he &s;topped at Tholou&s;e,
where he remained when Emily arrived, con|cealing,
yet indulging his melancholy in the
gardens, where he had formerly pa&s;&s;ed with her
&s;o many happy hours; often recurring, with
<PB N="307" REF="311">
vain regret, to the evening before her de|parture
for Italy, when &s;he had &s;o unex|pectedly
met him on the terrace, and endea|vouring
to recall to his memory every word
and look, which had then charmed him, the
arguments he had employed to di&s;&s;uade her
from the journey, and the tenderne&s;s of their
la&s;t farewel. In &s;uch melancholy recollec|tions
he had been indulging, when Emily
unexpectedly appeared to him on this very
terrace, the evening after her arrival at Tho|lou&s;e.
His emotions, on thus &s;eeing her,
can &s;carcely be imagined; but he &s;o far
overcame the fir&s;t promptings of love, that
he forbore to di&s;cover him&s;elf, and abruptly
quitted the gardens. Still, however, the vi|&s;ion
he had &s;een haunted his mind; he be|came
more wretched than before, and the
only &s;olace of his &s;orrow was to return in
the &s;ilence or the night; to follow the
paths which he believed her &s;teps had pre&s;&s;|ed,
during the day; and, to watch round
the habitation where &s;he repo&s;ed. It
was in one of the&s;e mournful wanderings,
<PB N="308" REF="312">
that he had received by the fire of the
gardener, who mi&s;took him for a robber, a
wound in his arm, which had detained
him at Tholou&s;e till very lately, under the
hands of a &s;urgeon. There, regardle&s;s of
him&s;elf and carele&s;s of his friends, who&s;e
late unkindne&s;s had urged him to believe,
that they were indifferent as to his fate, he
remained, without informing them of his
&s;ituation; and now, being &s;ufficiently reco|vered
to bear traveling, he had taken La
Vall&eacute;e in his way to E&s;tuviere, the Count's
re&s;idence, partly for the purpo&s;e of hearing
of Emily, and of being again near her, and
partly for that of enquiring into the &s;ituation
of poor old There&s;a, who, he had rea&s;on to
&s;uppo&s;e, had been deprived of her &s;tipend,
&s;mall as it was, and which enquiry had
brought him to her cottage, when Emily
happened to be there.</P>
<P>This unexpected interview, which had at
once &s;hewn him the tenderne&s;s of her love
and the &s;trength of her re&s;olution, renewed
all the acutene&s;s of the de&s;pair, that had at|tended
<PB N="309" REF="313">
their former &s;eparation, and which
no effort of rea&s;on could teach him, in the&s;e
moments, to &s;ubdue. Her image, her look,
the tones of her voice, all dwelt on his
fancy, as powerfully as they had lately ap|peared
to his &s;en&s;es, and bani&s;hed from his
heart every emotion, except tho&s;e of love
and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Before the evening concluded, he returned
to There&s;a's cottage, that he might hear her
talk of Emily, and be in the place, where
&s;he had &s;o lately been. The joy, felt and
expre&s;&s;ed by that faithful &s;ervant, was
quickly changed to &s;orrow, when &s;he ob|&s;erved,
at one moment, his wild and phren|&s;ied
look, and, at another, the dark melan|choly,
that overhung him.</P>
<P>After he had li&s;tened, and for a con&s;i|derable
time, to all &s;he had to relate, con|cerning
Emily, he gave There&s;a nearly all
the money he had about him, though &s;he
repeatedly refu&s;ed it, declaring, that her
mi&s;tre&s;s had amply &s;upplied her wants; and
then, drawing a ring of value from his &s;in|ger,
<PB N="310" REF="314">
he delivered it her with a &s;olemn charge
to pre&s;ent it to Emily, of whom he entreat|ed,
as a la&s;t favour, that &s;he would pre|&s;erve
it for his &s;ake, and &s;ometimes, when
&s;he looked upon it, remember the unhappy
giver.</P>
<P>There&s;a wept, as &s;he received the ring,
but it was more from &s;ympathy, than from
any pre&s;entiment of evil; and before &s;he
could reply, Valancourt abruptly left the
cottage. She followed him to the door,
calling upon his name and entreating him to
return; but &s;he received no an&s;wer, and
&s;aw him no more.</P>

<P>On the following morning, as Emily &s;at
in the parlour adjoining the library, reflect|ing
on the &s;cene of the preceding night,
Annette ru&s;hed wildly into the room, and,
without &s;peaking, &s;unk breathle&s;s into a
chair. It was &s;ome time before &s;he could
an&s;wer the anxious enquiries of Emily, as to
the occa&s;ion of her emotion, but, at length,
&s;he exclaimed, "I have &s;een his gho&s;t, ma|dam,
I have &s;een his gho&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Who do you mean?" &s;aid Emily, with
extreme impatience.</P>
<P>"It came, in from the hall, madam," con|tinued
Annette, "as I was cro&s;&s;ing to the
parlour."</P>
<P>"Who are you &s;peaking of?" repeated
Emily, "Who came in from the hall?"</P>

<PB N="311" REF="317">

<P><PB N="312" REF="318">
"It was dre&s;&s;ed ju&s;t as I have &s;een him,
often and often," added Annette. "Ah!
who could have thought&mdash;"</P>
<P>Emily's patience was now exhau&s;ted, and
&s;he was reprimanding her for &s;uch idle
fancies, when a &s;ervant entered the room,
and informed her, that a &s;tranger without
begged leave to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>It immediately occurred to Emily, that
this &s;tranger was Valancourt, and &s;he told
the &s;ervant to inform him, that &s;he was en|gaged,
and could not &s;ee any per&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant, having delivered his me&s;&s;age,
returned with one from the &s;tranger, urging
the fir&s;t reque&s;t, and &s;aying, that he had
&s;omething of con&s;equence to communicate;
while Annette, who had hitherto &s;at&punc; &s;ilent
and amazed, now &s;tarted up, and crying,
"It is Ludovico!&mdash;it is Ludovico!" ran
out of the room. Emily bade the &s;ervant
follow her, and, if it really was Ludovico,
to &s;hew him into the parlour.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Ludovico appeared, ac|companied
by Annette, who, as joy rendered
<PB N="313" REF="319">
her forgetful of all rules of decorum towards
her mi&s;tre&s;s, would not &s;uffer any per&s;on to
be heard, for &s;ome time, but her&s;elf. Emily
expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfaction, on &s;eeing
Ludovico in &s;afety, and the fir&s;t emotions
increa&s;ed, when he delivered letters from
Count De Villefort and the Lady Blanche,
informing her of their late adventure, and of
their pre&s;ent &s;ituation at an inn among the
Pyren&eacute;es, where they had been detained by
the illne&s;s of Mon&s;. St. Foix, and the indi&s;|po&s;ition
of Blanche, who added, that the
Baron St. Foix was ju&s;t arrived to attend
his &s;on to his chateau, where he would re|main
till the perfect recovery of his wounds,
and then return to Languedoc, but that her
father and her&s;elf purpo&s;ed to be at La
Vall&eacute;e, on the following day. She added,
that Emily's pre&s;ence would be expected at
the approaching nuptials, and begged &s;he
would be prepared to proceed, in a few days,
to Chateau-le-Blanc. For an account of
Ludovico's adventure, &s;he referred her to
him&s;elf; and Emily, though much inter|e&s;ted,
<PB N="314" REF="320">
concerning the means, by which he
had di&s;appeared from the north apartments,
had the forbearance to &s;u&s;pend the gratifi|cation
of her curio&s;ity, till he had taken
&s;ome refre&s;hment, and had conver&s;ed with
Annette, who&s;e joy, on &s;eeing him in &s;afety,
could not have been more extravagant, had
he ari&s;en from the grave.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Emily peru&s;ed again the let|ters
of her friends, who&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;|teem
and kindne&s;s were very nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;olations
to her heart, awakened as it was
by the late interview to emotions of keener
&s;orrow and regret.</P>
<P>The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc was
pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much kindne&s;s by the Count
and his daughter, who &s;trengthened it by a
me&s;&s;age from the Counte&s;s, and the occa|&s;ion
of it was &s;o important to her friend,
that Emily could not refu&s;e to accept it,
nor, though &s;he wi&s;hed to remain in the
quiet &s;hades of her native home, could &s;he
avoid perceiving the impropriety of remain|ing
there alone, &s;ince Valancourt was again
<PB N="315" REF="321">
in the neighbourhood. Sometimes, too, &s;hw
thought, that change of &s;cenery and the &s;o|ciety
of her friends might contribute, more
than retirement, to re&s;tore her to tranquil|lity.</P>
<P>When Ludovico again appeared, &s;he de|&s;ired
him to give a detail of his adventure
in the north apartments, and to tell by what
means he became a companion of the ban|ditti,
with whom the Count had found him.</P>
<P>He immediately obeyed, while Annette,
who had not yet had lei&s;ure to a&s;k him
many que&s;tions, on the &s;ubject, prepared
to li&s;ten, with a countenance of extreme cu|rio&s;ity,
venturing to remind her lady of her
incredulity, concerning &s;pirits, in the ca&s;tle
of Udolpho, and of her own &s;agacity in
believing in them; while Emily, blu&s;hing
at the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her late credulity,
ob&s;erved, that, if Ludovico's adventure
could ju&s;tify Annette's &s;upper&s;tition, he had
probably not been, here to relate it.</P>
<P>Ludovico &s;miled at Annette, and bowed
to Emily, and then began as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="322">
"You may remember, madam, that, on
the night, when I &s;at up in the north cham|ber,
my lord, the Count, and Mon&s;. Henri
accompanied me thither, and that, while
they remained there, nothing happened to
excite any alarm. When they were gone I
made a fire in the bed-room, and, not being
inclined to &s;leep, I &s;at down on the hearth
with a book I had brought with me to di|vert
my mind. I confe&s;s I did &s;ometimes
look round the chamber, with &s;omething
like apprehen&s;ion&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O very like it, I dare &s;ay," interrupted
Annette, "and I dare &s;ay too, if the truth
was known, you &s;hook from head to foot."</P>
<P>"Not quite &s;o bad as that," replied Lu|dovico,
&s;miling, "but &s;everal times, as the
wind whi&s;tled round the ca&s;tle, and &s;hook
the old ca&s;ements, I did fancy I heard odd
noi&s;es, and, once or twice, I got up and
looked about me; but nothing was to be
&s;een, except the grim figures in the tape&s;try,
which &s;eemed to frown upon me, as I
looked at them. I had fat thus for above
<PB N="317" REF="323">
an hour," continued Ludovico, "when
again I thought I heard a noi&s;e, and glanced
my eyes round the room, to di&s;cover what
it came from, but, not perceiving any thing,
I began to read again, and, when I had
fini&s;hed the &s;tory I was upon, I felt drow&s;y,
and dropped a&s;leep. But pre&s;ently I was
awakened by the noi&s;e I had heard before,
and it &s;eemed to come from that part of the
chamber, where the bed &s;tood; and then,
whether it was the &s;tory I had been reading
that affected my &s;pirits, or the &s;trange re|ports,
that had been &s;pread of the&s;e apart|ments,
I don't know, but, when I looked
towards the bed again, I fancied I &s;aw a
man's face within the du&s;ky curtains."</P>
<P>At the mention of this, Emily trembled,
and looked anxiou&s;ly, remembering the
&s;pectacle &s;he had her&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed there with Doroth&eacute;e.</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s, madam, my heart did fail
me, at that in&s;tant," continued Ludovico,
"but a return of the noi&s;e drew my atten|tion
<PB N="318" REF="324">
from the bed, and I then di&s;tinctly
heard a &s;ound, like that of a key, turning
in a lock, but what &s;urpri&s;ed me more was,
that I &s;aw no door where the &s;ound &s;eemed
to come from. In the next moment, how|ever,
the arras near the bed was &s;lowly
lifted, and a per&s;on appeared behind it, en|tering
from a &s;mall door in the wall. He
&s;tood for a moment as if half retreating,
with his head bending under the arras which
concealed the upper part of his face except
his eyes &s;cowling beneath the tape&s;try as he
held it; and then, while he rai&s;ed it higher,
I &s;aw the face of another man behind, look|ing
over his &s;houlder. I know not how it
was, but, though my &s;word was upon the
table before me, I had not the power ju&s;t
then to &s;eize it, but &s;at quite &s;till, watching
them, with my eyes half &s;hut as if I was
a&s;leep. I &s;uppo&s;e they thought me &s;o, and
were debating what they &s;hould do, for I
heard them whi&s;per, and they &s;tood in the
&s;ame po&s;ture for the value of a minute, and
<PB N="319" REF="325">
then, I thought I perceived other faces in
the du&s;kine&s;s beyond the door, and heard
louder whi&s;pers."</P>
<P>"This door &s;urprifes me," &s;aid Emily,
"becau&s;e I under&s;tood, that the Count
had cau&s;ed the arras to be lifted, and the
walls examined, &s;u&s;pecting, that they might
have concealed a pa&s;&s;age through which
you had departed."</P>
<P>"It does not appear &s;o extraordinary to
me, madam," replied Ludovico, "that this
door &s;hould e&s;cape notice, becau&s;e it was
formed in a narrow compartment, which
appeared to be part of the outward wall,
and, if the Count had not pa&s;&s;ed over it,
he might have thought it was u&s;ele&s;s to
&s;earch for a door where it &s;eemed as if no
pa&s;&s;age could communicate, with one; but
the truth was, that the pa&s;&s;age was formed
within the wall it&s;elf.&mdash;But, to return to
the men, whom I &s;aw ob&s;curely beyond
the door, and who did not &s;uffer me to re|main
long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning their de|&s;ign.
They all ru&s;hed into the room, and
<PB N="320" REF="326">
&s;urrounded me, though not before I had
&s;natched up my &s;word to defend my&s;elf.
But what could one man do again&s;t four?
They &s;oon di&s;armed me, and, having fa&s;t|ened
my arms, and gagged my mouth,
forced me through the private door, leav|ing
my &s;word upon the table, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, as
they &s;aid, tho&s;e who &s;hould come in the
morning to look for me, in fighting again&s;t
the gho&s;ts. They then led me through
many narrow pa&s;&s;ages, cut, as I fancied,
in the walls, for I had never &s;een them be|fore,
and down &s;everal flights of &s;teps, till
we came to the vaults underneath the ca&s;|tle;
and then opening a &s;tone door, which
I &s;hould have taken for the wall it&s;elf, we
went through a long pa&s;&s;age, and down
other &s;teps cut in the &s;olid rock, when
another door delivered us into a cave. Af|ter
turning and twining about, for &s;ome
time, we reached the mouth of it, and I
found my&s;elf on the &s;ea-beach at the foot
of the cliffs, with the chateau above. A
boat was in waiting, into which the ru&s;|&s;ians
<PB N="321" REF="327">
got, forcing me along with them, and
we &s;oon reached a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, that was at
anchor, where other men appeared, when
&s;etting me aboard, two of the fellows who
had &s;eized me, followed, and the other two
rowed back to the &s;hore, while we &s;et fail.
I &s;oon found out what all this meant, and
what was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e men at the
chateau. We landed in Rou&s;illon, and,
after lingering &s;everal days about the &s;hore,
&s;ome of their comrades came down from
the mountains, and carried me with them
to the fort, where I remained till my Lord
&s;o unexpectedly arrived, for they had taken
good care to prevent my running away,
having blindfolded me, during the journey,
and, if they had not done this, I think I
never could have found my road to any
town, through the wild country we tra|ver&s;ed.
After I reached the fort I was
watched like a pri&s;oner, and never &s;uffered
to go out, without two or three compa|nions,
and I became &s;o weary of life, that I
often wi&s;hed to get rid of it."</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="328">
"Well, but they let you talk," &s;aid An|nette,
"they did not gagg you after they
got you away from the chateau, &s;o I don't
&s;ee what rea&s;on there was to be &s;o very
weary of living; to &s;ay nothing about the
chance you had of feeing me again."</P>
<P>Ludovico &s;miled, and Emily al&s;o, who
enquired what was the motive of the&s;e men
for carrying him off.</P>
<P>"I &s;oon found out, madam," re&s;umed Lu|dovico,
"that they were pirates, who had,
during many years, &s;ecreted their &s;poil in
the vaults of the ca&s;tle, which, being &s;o
near the &s;ea, &s;uited their purpo&s;e well. To
prevent detection they had tried to have it
believed, that the chateau was haunted, and,
having di&s;covered the private way to the
north apartments, which had been &s;hut
up ever &s;ince the death of the lady mar|chione&s;s,
they ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded. The hou&s;e-keeper
and her hu&s;band, who were the
only per&s;ons, that had inhabited the ca&s;tle,
for &s;ome years, were &s;o terrified by the
&s;trange noi&s;es they heard in the nights, that
<PB N="323" REF="329">
they would live there no longer; a report
&s;oon went abroad, that it was haunted, and
the whole country believed this the more
readily, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it had been &s;aid,
that the lady marchione&s;s had died in a
&s;trange way, and becau&s;e my lord never
would return to the place afterwards."</P>
<P>"But why," &s;aid Emily, "were not the&s;e
pirates contented with the cave&mdash;why did
they think it nece&s;&s;ary to depo&s;it their &s;poil
in the ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>"The cave, madam," replied Ludovico,
"was open to any body, and their trea&s;ures
would not long have remained undi&s;covered
there, but in the vaults they were &s;ecure &s;o
long as the report prevailed of their being
haunted. Thus then, it appears, that they
brought at midnight, the &s;poil they took on
the &s;eas, and kept it till they had oppor|tunities
of di&s;po&s;ing of it to advantage.
The pirates were connected with Spanish
&s;mugglers and banditti, who live among the
wilds of the Pyren&eacute;es, and carry on various
kinds of traffic, &s;uch as nobody would think
<PB N="324" REF="330">
of; and with this de&s;perate horde of ban|ditti
I remained, till my lord arrived. I &s;hall
never forget what I felt, when I fir&s;t di&s;|covered
him&mdash;I almo&s;t gave him up for
lo&s;t! but I knew, that, if I &s;hewed my&s;elf,
the banditti would di&s;cover who he was,
and probably murder us all, to prevent
their &s;ecret in the chateau being detected. I,
therefore, kept out of my lord's &s;ight, but
had a &s;trict watch upon the ru&s;&s;ians, and
determined, if they offered him or his fa|mily
violence, to di&s;cover my&s;elf, and fight
for our lives. Soon after, I overheard
&s;ome of them laying a mo&s;t diabolical plan
for the murder and plunder of the whole
party, when I contrived to &s;peak to &s;ome of
my lord's attendants, telling them what was
going forward, and we con&s;ulted what was
be&s;t to be done; meanwhile my lord,
alarmed at the ab&s;ence of the Lady Blanche,
demanded her, and the ru&s;&s;ians having
given &s;ome un&s;atisfactory an&s;wer, my lord
and Mon&s;. St. Foix became furious, &s;o
then we thought it a good time to di&s;cover
<PB N="325" REF="331">
the plot, and ru&s;hing into the chamber, I
called out "Treachery! my lord count, de|fend
your&s;elf!" His lord&s;hip and the
chevalier drew their &s;words directly, and a
hard battle we had, but we conquered at
la&s;t, as, madam, you are already informed
of by my Lord Count."</P>
<P>"This is an extraordinary adventure,"
&s;aid Emily, and much prai&s;e is due, Ludo|vico,
to your prudence and intrepidity.
There are &s;ome cifcum&s;tances, however,
concerning the north apartments, which &s;till
perplex me; but, perhaps, you may be able
to explain them. Did you ever hear the
banditti relate any thing extraordinary of
the&s;e rooms."</P>
<P>"No, madam," replied Ludovico, "I
never heard them &s;peak about the rooms,
except to laugh at the credulity of the old
hou&s;ekeeper, who once was very near catch|ing
one of the pirates; it was &s;ince the
Count arrived at the chateau, he &s;aid, and
he laughed heartily as he related the trick
he had played off."</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="332">
A blu&s;h over&s;pread Emily's cheek, and
&s;he impatiently de&s;ired Ludovico to ex|plain
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Why, my lady," &s;aid he, "as this
fellow was, one night in the bed-room, he
heard &s;omebody approaching through the
next apartment, and not having time to lift
up the arras, and unfa&s;ten the door, he hid
him&s;elf in the bed ju&s;t by. There he lay
for &s;ome time in as great a fright, I &s;up|po&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>"As you was in," interrupted Annette,
"when you &s;at up &s;o boldly to watch by
your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid Ludovico," in as great a
fright as he ever made any body el&s;e &s;uf|fer;
and pre&s;ently the hou&s;ekeeper and &s;ome
other per&s;on came up to the bed, when
he, thinking they were going to examine
it, bethought him, that his only chance of
e&s;caping detection, was by terrrifying them;
&s;o he lifted up the counterpane, but that
did not do, till he rai&s;ed his face above
it, and then they both &s;et off, he &s;aid, as if
<PB N="327" REF="333">
they had &s;een the devil, and he got out of
the rooms undi&s;covered."</P>
<P>Emily could not forbear &s;miling at this
explanation of the deception, which had
given her &s;o much &s;uper&s;titious terror; and
was &s;urpri&s;ed, that &s;he could have &s;uffered
her&s;elf to be thus alarmed, till &s;he con&s;i|dered,
that, when the mind has Once begun
to yield to the weakne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition,
trifles impre&s;s it with the force of convic|tion.
Still, however, &s;he remembered with
awe the my&s;terious mu&s;ic, which had
been heard, at midnight, near Chateau-le|Blanc,
and &s;he a&s;ked Ludovico if he could
give any explanation of it; but he could
not.</P>
<P>"I only know, madam," he added,
"that it did not belong to the pirates, for I
have heard them laugh about it, and &s;ay,
they believed the devil was in league with
them there."</P>
<P>"Yes, I will an&s;wer for it he was," &s;aid
Annette, her countenance brightening, "I
was &s;ure all along, that he or his &s;pirits
<PB N="328" REF="334">
had &s;omething to do with the north apart|ments,
and now you &s;ee, madam, I am
right at la&s;t."</P>
<P>"It cannot be denied, that his &s;pirits
were very bu&s;y in that part of the cha|teau,"
replied Emily, &s;miling. "But I am
&s;urpri&s;ed, Ludovico, that the&s;e pirates
&s;hould per&s;evere in their &s;chemes, after the
arrival of the Count; what could they
expect but certain detection?"</P>
<P>"I have rea&s;on to believe, madam," re|plied
Ludovico, "that it was their intention
to per&s;evere no longer than was nece&s;&s;ary
for the removal of the &s;tores, which were
depo&s;ited in the vaults; and it appeared,
that they had been employed in doing &s;o
from within a &s;hort period after the Count's
arrival; but, as they had only a few hours
in the night for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and were
carrying on other &s;chemes at the &s;ame time,
the vaults were not above half emptied,
when they took me away. They gloried
exceedingly in this opportunity of con|firming
the &s;uper&s;titious reports, that had
<PB N="329" REF="335">
been &s;pread of the north chambers, were
careful to leave every thing there as they had
found it, the better to promote the decep|tion,
and frequently, in their joco&s;e moods,
would laugh at the con&s;ternation, which
they believed the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle
had &s;uffered upon my di&s;appearing, and it
was to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of my betray|ing
their &s;ecret, that they had removed me
to &s;uch a di&s;tance. From that period they
con&s;idered the chateau as nearly their own;
but I found from the di&s;cour&s;e of their
comrades, that, though they were cautious,
at fir&s;t, in &s;hewing their power there, they
had once very nearly betrayed them&s;elves.
Going, one night, as was their cu&s;tom, to
the north chambers to repeat the noi&s;es,
that had occa&s;ioned &s;uch alarm among the
&s;ervants, they heard, as they were about to
unfa&s;ten the &s;ecret door, voices in the bed|room.
My lord has &s;ince told me, that
him&s;elf and M. Henri were then in the
apartment, and they heard very extraordi|nary
&s;ounds of lamentation, which it &s;eems
<PB N="330" REF="336">
were made by the&s;e fellows, with their u&s;ual
de&s;ign of &s;preading terror; and my lord
has owned, he then felt &s;omewhat more,
than &s;urpri&s;e; but, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to
the peace of his family, that no notice
&s;hould be taken, he was &s;ilent on the &s;ub|ject,
and enjoined &s;ilence to his &s;on."</P>
<P>Emily, recollecting the change, that had
appeared in the &s;pirits of the Count, after
the night, when he had watched in the
north room, now perceived the cau&s;e of it;
and, having made &s;ome further enquiries
upon this &s;trange affair, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Lu|dovico,
and went to give orders for the ac|commodation
of her friends, on the follow|ing
day.</P>
<P>In the evening, There&s;a, lame as &s;he was,
came to deliver the ring, with which Va|lancourt
had entru&s;ted her, and, when &s;he
pre&s;ented it, Emily was much affected, for
&s;he remembered to have &s;een him wear it
often in happier days. She was, however,
much di&s;plea&s;ed, that There&s;a had received
it, and po&s;itively refu&s;ed to accept it her|&s;elf,
<PB N="331" REF="337">
though to have done &s;o would have
afforded her a melancholy plea&s;ure. The|re&s;a
entreated, expo&s;tulated, and then de|scribed
the di&s;tre&s;s of Valancourt, when he
had given the ring, and repeated the me&s;|&s;age,
with which he had commi&s;&s;ioned her
to deliver it; and Emily could not con|ceal
the extreme &s;orrow this recital occa|&s;ioned
her, but wept, and remained lo&s;t in
thought.</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear young lady!" &s;aid The|re&s;a,
"why &s;hould all this be? I have
known you from your infancy, and it may
well be &s;uppo&s;ed I love you, as if you was
my own, and wi&s;h as much to &s;ee you hap|py.
M. Valancourt, to be &s;ure, I have
not known &s;o long, but then I have rea&s;on
to love him, as though he was my own &s;on.
I know how well you love one another, or
why all this weeping and wailing?" Emily
waved her hand for There&s;a to be &s;ilent,
who, di&s;regarding the &s;ignal, continued,
"And how much you are alike in your
tempers and ways, and, that, if you were
<PB N="332" REF="338">
married, you would be the happie&s;t couple
in the whole province&mdash;then what is there
to prevent your marrying? Dear dear! to
&s;ee how &s;ome people fling away their hap|pine&s;s,
and then cry and lament about it,
ju&s;t as if it was not their own doing, and
as if there was more plea&s;ure in wailing and
weeping, than in being at peace. Learn|ing,
to be &s;ure, is a fine thing, but, if it
teaches folks no better than that, why I
had rather be without it; if it would teach
them to be happier, I would &s;ay &s;ome|thing
to it, then it would be learning and
wi&s;dom too."</P>
<P>Age and long &s;ervices had given There&s;a
a privilege to talk, but Emily now endea|voured
to check her loquacity, and, though
&s;he felt the ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;ome of her remarks,
did not choo&s;e to explain the circum&s;tances,
that had determined her conduct towards Va|lancourt.
She, therefore, only told There&s;a,
that it would much di&s;plea&s;e her to hear
the &s;ubject renewed; that &s;he had rea&s;ons
<PB N="333" REF="339">
for her conduct, which &s;he did not think it
proper to mention, and that the ring mu&s;t
be returned, with an a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he
could not accept it with propriety; and, at
the &s;ame time, &s;he forbade There&s;a to re|peat
any future me&s;&s;age from Valancourt,
as &s;he valued her e&s;teem and kindne&s;s.
There&s;a was afflicted, and made another
attempt, though feeble, to intere&s;t her for
Valancourt, but the unu&s;ual di&s;plea&s;ure,
expre&s;&s;ed in Emily's countenance, &s;oon
obliged her to de&s;i&s;t, and &s;he departed in
wonder and lamentation.</P>
<P>To relieve her mind, in &s;ome degree, from
the painful recollections, that intruded upon
it, Emily bu&s;ied her&s;elf in preparations for
the journey into Languedoc, and, while An|nette,
who a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, &s;poke with joy and
affection of the &s;afe return of Ludovico,
&s;he was con&s;idering how &s;he might be&s;t pro|mote
their happine&s;s, and determined, if it
appeared, that his affection was as un|changed
as that of the &s;imple and hone&s;t
Annette, to give her a marriage portion,
<PB N="334" REF="340">
and &s;ettle them on &s;ome part of her e&s;tate.
The&s;e con&s;iderations led her to the remem|brance
of her father's paternal domain,
which his affairs had formerly compelled
him to di&s;po&s;e of to M. Que&s;nel, and which
&s;he frequently wi&s;hed to regain, becau&s;e St.
Aubert had lamented, that the chief lands
of his ance&s;tors had pa&s;&s;ed into another
family, and becau&s;e they had been his birth|place
and the haunt of his early years.
To the e&s;tate at Tholou&s;e &s;he had no pe|culiar
attachment, and it was her wi&s;h to
di&s;po&s;e of this, that &s;he might purcha&s;e her
paternal domains, if M. Que&s;nel could be
prevailed on to part with them, which, as he
talked much of living in Italy, did not ap|pear
very improbable.</P>

<P>On the following day, the arrival of her
friend revived the drooping Emily, and La
Vall&eacute;e became once more the &s;cene of &s;ocial
kindne&s;s and of elegant ho&s;pitality. Illne&s;s
and the terror &s;he had &s;uffered had &s;tolen
from Blanche much of her &s;prightline&s;s, but
all her affectionate &s;implicity remained, and,
though &s;he appeared le&s;s blooming, &s;he was
not le&s;s engaging than before. The unfor|tunate
adventure on the Pyren&eacute;es had made
the Count very anxious to reach home, and,
after little more than a week's &s;tay at La
Vall&eacute;e, Emily prepared to &s;et out with her
friends for Languedoc, a&s;&s;igning the care of
her hou&s;e, during her ab&s;ence, to There&s;a.
<PB N="336" REF="342">
On the evening, preceding her departure,
this old &s;ervant brought again the ring of
Valancourt, and, with tears, entreated her
mi&s;tre&s;s to receive it, for that &s;he had neither
&s;een, or heard of M. Valancourt, &s;ince the
night when he delivered it to her. As &s;he &s;aid
this, her countenance expre&s;&s;ed more alarm,
than &s;he dared to utter; but Emily, check|ing
her own propen&s;ity to fear, con&s;idered,
that he had probably returned to the re&s;i|dence
of his brother, and, again refu&s;ing to
accept the ring, bade There&s;a pre&s;erve it,
till &s;he &s;aw him, which, with extreme reluc|tance,
&s;he promi&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>On the following day, Count De Villefort,
with Emily and the Lady Blanche, left La
Vall&eacute;e, and, on the en&s;uing evening, arrived
at the Chateau-le-Blanc, where the Coun|te&s;s,
Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom Emily
was &s;urpri&s;ed to find there, received them
with much joy and congratulation. She
was concerned to ob&s;erve, that the Count
&s;till encouraged the hopes of his friend,
who&s;e countenance declared, that his affect|tion
<PB N="337" REF="343">
had &s;uffered no abatement from ab&s;ence;
and was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, when, on the &s;econd
evening after her arrival, the Count, having
withdrawn her from the Lady Blanche, with
whom &s;he was walking, renewed the &s;ubject
of M. Du Pont's hopes. The mildne&s;s,
with which &s;he li&s;tened to his interce&s;&s;ions
at fir&s;t, deceiving him, as to her &s;entiments,
he began to believe, that, her affection for
Valancourt being overcome, &s;he was, at
length, di&s;po&s;ed to think favourably of M.
Du Pont; and, when &s;he afterwards con|vinced
him of his mi&s;take, he ventured, in
the earne&s;tne&s;s of his wi&s;h to promote what
he con&s;idered to be the happine&s;s of two
per&s;ons, whom he &s;o much e&s;teemed, gently
to remon&s;trate with her, on thus &s;uffering an
ill-placed affection to poi&s;on the happine&s;s
of her mo&s;t valuable years.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving her &s;ilence and the deep dejec|tion
of her countenance, he concluded with
&s;aying, "I will not &s;ay more now, but I
will &s;till believe, my dear Mademoi&s;elle St.
Aubert, that you will nor always reject a
<PB N="338" REF="344">
per&s;on, &s;o truly e&s;timable as my friend Du
Pont."</P>
<P>He &s;pared her the pain of replying, by
leaving her; and &s;he &s;trolled on, &s;omewhat
di&s;plea&s;ed with the Count for having per&s;e|vered
to plead for a &s;uit, which &s;he had re|peatedly
rejected, and lo&s;t amid&s;t the melan|choly
recollections, which this topic had re|vived,
till &s;he had in&s;en&s;ibly reached the
borders of the woods, that &s;creened the mo|na&s;tery
of St. Clair, when, perceiving how
far &s;he had wandered, &s;he determined to ex|tend
her walk a little farther, and to enquire
after the abbe&s;s and &s;ome of her friends
among the nuns.</P>
<P>Though the evening was now drawing to
a clo&s;e, &s;he accepted the invitation of the
friar, who opened the gate, and, anxious to
meet &s;ome of her old acquaintance, pro|ceeded
towards the convent parlour. As
&s;he cro&s;&s;ed the lawn, that &s;toped from the
front of the mona&s;tery towards the &s;ea, &s;he
was &s;truck with the picture of repo&s;e, exhi|bited
by &s;ome monks, &s;itting in the cloi&s;ters,
<PB N="339" REF="345">
which extended under the brew of the
woods, that crowned this eminence; where,
as they meditated, at this twilight hour,
holy &s;ubjects, they &s;ometimes &s;uffered their
attention to be relieved by the &s;cene before
them, nor thought it profane to look at na|ture,
now that it had exchanged the bril|liant
colours of day for the &s;ober hue of
evening. Before the cloi&s;ters, however,
&s;pread an ancient che&s;nut, who&s;e ample
branches were de&s;igned to &s;creen the full
magnificence of a &s;cene, that might tempt
the wi&s;h to worldly plea&s;ures; but &s;till, be|neath
the dark and &s;preading foliage, gleam|ed
a wide extent of ocean, and many a pa&s;&s;|ing
&s;ail; while, to the right and left, thick
woods were &s;een &s;tretching along the wind|ing
&s;hores. So much as this had been ad|mitted,
perhaps, to give to the &s;ecluded vo|tary
an image of the dangers and vici&s;&s;itudes
of life, and to con&s;ole him, now that he had
renounced its plea&s;ures, by the certainty of
having e&s;caped its evils. As Emily walked
<PB N="340" REF="346">
pen&s;ively along, con&s;idering how much &s;uf|fering
&s;he might have e&s;caped, had &s;he be|come
a votare&s;s of the order, and remained
in this retirement from the time of her fa|ther's
death, the ve&s;per-bell &s;truck up, and
the monks retired &s;lowly toward the chapel,
while &s;he, pur&s;uing her way, entered the
great hall, where an unu&s;ual &s;ilence &s;eemed
to reign. The parlour too, which opened
from it, &s;he found vacant, but, as the even|ing
bell was &s;ounding, &s;he believed the
nuns had withdrawn into the chapel, and
&s;at down to re&s;t, for a moment, before &s;he
returned to the chateau, where, however,
the increa&s;ing gloom made her now anxious
to be.</P>
<P>Not many minutes had elap&s;ed, before a
nun, entering in ha&s;te, enquired for the ab|be&s;s,
and was retiring, without recollecting
Emily, when &s;he made her&s;elf known, and
then learned, that a ma&s;s was going to be
performed for the &s;oul of &s;i&s;ter Agnes, who
had been declining, for &s;ome time, and who
was now believed to be dying.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="347">
Of her &s;ufferings the &s;i&s;ter gave a melan|choly
account, and of the horrors, into which
&s;he had frequently &s;tarted, but which had
now yielded to a dejection &s;o gloomy, that
neither the prayers, in which &s;he was joined
by the &s;i&s;terhood, or the a&s;&s;urances of her
confe&s;&s;or, had power to recall her from it,
or to cheer her mind even with a momentary
gleam of comfort.</P>
<P>To this relation Emily li&s;tened with ex|treme
concern, and, recollecting the fren|zied
manners and the expre&s;&s;ions of horror,
which &s;he had her&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed of Agnes, to|gether
with the hi&s;tory, that &s;i&s;ter Frances had
communicated, her compa&s;&s;ion was height|ened
to a very painful degree. As the even|ing
was already far advanced, Emily did
not now de&s;ire to &s;ee her, or to join in the
ma&s;s, and, after leaving many kind remem|brances
with the nun, for her old friends,
&s;he quitted the mona&s;tery, and returned over
the cliffs toward the chateau, meditating
upon what &s;he had ju&s;t: heard, till, at length
<PB N="342" REF="348">
&s;he forced her mind upon le&s;s intere&s;ting
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The wind was high, and as &s;he drew near
the chateau, &s;he often pau&s;ed to li&s;ten to
its awful &s;ound, as it &s;wept over the bil|lows,
that beat below, or groaned along the
&s;urrounding woods; and, while &s;he re&s;ted
on a cliff at a &s;hort di&s;tance from the cha|teau,
and looked upon the wide waters, &s;een
dimly beneath the la&s;t &s;hade of twilight, &s;he
thought of the following addre&s;s.</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>Viewle&s;s, through heaven's va&s;t vault your cour&s;e

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the following evening, the view of
the convent towers, ri&s;ing among the &s;ha|dowy
woods, reminded Emily of the nun,
who&s;e condition had &s;o much affected her;
and, anxious to know how &s;he was, as well
as to &s;ee &s;ome of her former friends, &s;he
and the Lady Blanche extended their walk
to the mona&s;tery. At the gate &s;tood a car|riage,
which, from the heat of the hor&s;es,
appeared to have ju&s;t arrived; but a more
than common &s;tillne&s;s pervaded the court
and the cloi&s;ters, through which Emily and
Blanche pa&s;&s;ed in their way to the great
hall, where a nun, who was cro&s;&s;ing to the
&s;tair-ca&s;e, replied to the enquiries of the
<PB N="345" REF="351">
former, that &s;i&s;ter Agnes was &s;till living,
and &s;en&s;ible, but that it was thought &s;he
could not &s;urvive the night. In the par|lour,
they found &s;everal of the boarders,
who rejoiced to see Emily, and told her
many little circum&s;tances that had happened
in the convent &s;ince her departure, and
which were intere&s;ting to her only becau&s;e
they related to per&s;ons, whom &s;he had re|garded
with affection. While they thus
conver&s;ed, the abbe&s;s entered the room,
and expre&s;&s;ed much &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing
Emily, but her manner was unu&s;ually &s;o|lemn,
and her countenance dejected. "Our
hou&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, after the fir&s;t &s;alutations
were over, "is truly a hou&s;e of mourning&mdash;a
daughter is now paying the debt of na|ture.&mdash;You
have heard, perhaps, that our
daughter Agnes is dying?"</P>
<P>Emily expre&s;&s;ed her &s;incere concern.</P>
<P>"Her death pre&s;ents to us a great and
awful le&s;&s;on," continued the abbe&s;s; "let
us read it, and profit by it; let it teach us
to prepare our&s;elves for the change, that
<PB N="346" REF="352">
awaits us all! You are young, and have it
yet in your power to &s;ecure "the peace
that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding"&mdash;the peace
of con&s;cience. Pre&s;erve it in your youth,
that it may comfort you in age; for vain,
alas! and imperfect are the good deeds of
our latter years, if tho&s;e of our early life
have been evil!"</P>
<P>Emily would have &s;aid, that good deeds,
&s;he hoped, were never vain; but &s;he con&s;i|dered
that it was the abbe&s;s who &s;poke, and
&s;he remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"The latter days of Agnes," re&s;umed
the abbe&s;s, "have been exemplary; would
they might atone for the errors of her for|mer
ones! Her &s;ufferings now, alas! are
great; let us believe, that they will make
her peace hereafter! I have left her with
her confe&s;&s;or, and a gentleman, whom &s;he
has long been anxious to &s;ee, and who is ju&s;t
arrived from Paris. They, I hope, will be
able to admini&s;ter the repo&s;e, which her
mind has hitherto wante!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;ervently joined in the wi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="353">
"During her illne&s;s, &s;he has &s;ometimes
named you," re&s;umed the abbe&s;s; "per|haps,
it would comfort her to &s;ee you;
when her pre&s;ent vi&s;itors have left her, we
will go to her chamber, if the &s;cene will not
be too melancholy for your &s;pirits. But,
indeed, to &s;uch &s;cenes, however painful, we
ought to accu&s;tom our&s;elves, for they are
&s;alutary to the &s;oul, and prepare us for
what we are our&s;elves to &s;uffer."</P>
<P>Emily became grave and thoughtful;
for this conver&s;ation brought to her recol|lection
the dying moments of her beloved
father, and &s;he wi&s;hed once more to weep
over the &s;pot, where his remains were bu|ried.
During the &s;ilence, which followed
the abbe&s;s's &s;peech, many minute circum|&s;tances
attending his la&s;t hours occurred to
her&mdash;his emotion on perceiving him&s;elf to
be in the neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc&mdash;his
reque&s;t to be interred in a par|ticular
&s;pot in the church of this mona&s;tery&mdash;and
the &s;olemn charge he had delivered
her to de&s;troy certain papers, without exa|mining
<PB N="348" REF="354">
them.&mdash;She recollected al&s;o the
my&s;terious and horrible words in tho&s;e ma|nu&s;cripts,
upon which her eye had involun|tarily
glanced; and, though they now, and,
indeed, whenever &s;he remembered them, re|vived
an exce&s;s of painful curio&s;ity, con|cerning
their full import, and the motives
for her father's command, it was ever her
chief con&s;olation, that &s;he had &s;trictly obeyed
him in this particular.</P>
<P>Little more was &s;aid by the abbe&s;s, who
appeared too much affected by the &s;ubject
&s;he had lately left, to be willing to con|ver&s;e,
and her companions had been for
&s;ome time &s;ilent from the &s;ame cau&s;e, when
this general reverie was interrupted by the
entrance of a &s;tranger, Mon&s;ieur Bonnac,
who had ju&s;t quitted the chamber of &s;i&s;ter
Agnes. He appeared much di&s;turbed,
but Emily fancied, that his countenance
had more the expre&s;&s;ion of horror, than
of grief. Having drawn the abbe&s;s to a
di&s;tant part of the room, he conver&s;ed with
her for &s;ome time, during which &s;he &s;eemed
<PB N="349" REF="355">
to li&s;ten with earne&s;t attention, and he to
&s;peak with caution, and a more than com|mon
degree of intere&s;t. When he had con|cluded,
he bowed &s;ilently to the re&s;t of the
company, and quitted the room. The ab|be&s;s,
&s;oon after, propo&s;ed going to the
chamber of &s;i&s;ter Agnes, to which Emily
con&s;ented, though not without &s;ome reluc|tance,
and Lady Blanche remained with
the boarders below.</P>
<P>At the door of the chamber they met
the confe&s;&s;or, whom, as he lifted up his
head on their approach, Emily ob&s;erved to
be the &s;ame that had attended her dying fa|ther;
but he passed on, without noticing
her, and they entered the apartment, where,
on a mattre&s;s, was laid sifter Agnes, with
one nun watching in the chair beside her.
Her countenance was &s;o much, changed,
that Emily would &s;carcely have recollected
her, had &s;he not been prepared to do &s;o:
it was gha&s;tly, and over&s;pread with gloomy
horror; her dim and hollow eyes were fixed
on a crucifix, which &s;he held upon her bo|som
<PB N="350" REF="356">
and &s;he was &s;o much engaged in
thought, as not to perceive the abbe&s;s and
Emily, till they stood at the bed-&s;ide,
Then, turning her heavy eyes, &s;he fixed
them, in wild horror, upon Emily; and,
&s;creaming, exclaimed, "Ah! that vi&s;ion
comes upon me in my dying hours!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;tarted back in terror, and looked
for explanation to the abbe&s;s, who made her
a &s;ignal not to be alarmed, and calmly &s;aid
to Agnes, "Daughter, I have brought
Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert to vi&s;it you: I
thought you would be glad to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>Agnes made no reply; but, &s;till gazing
wildly upon Emily, exclaimed, "It is her
very &s;elf! Oh! there is all that fa&s;cination
in her look, which proved my de&s;truction!
What would you have&mdash;what is it you
come to demand&mdash;Retribution?&mdash;It will
&s;oon be yours&mdash;it is yours already. How
many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince la&s;t I &s;aw
you! My crime is but as ye&s;terday.&mdash;Yet
I am grown old beneath it; while you
are &s;till young and blooming&mdash;blooming as
<PB N="351" REF="357">
when you forced me to commit that mo&s;t
abhorred deed! O! could I once forget it!&mdash;yet
what would that avail?&mdash;the deed is
done!"</P>
<P>Emily, extremely &s;hocked, would now
have left the room; but the abbe&s;s, taking
her hand, tried to &s;upport her &s;pirits, and
begged &s;he would &s;tay a few moments,
when Agnes would probably be calm,
whom now &s;he tried to &s;ooth, But the lat|ter
&s;eemed to di&s;regard her, while &s;he &s;till
fixed her eyes on Emily, and added,
"What are years of prayers and repent|ance?
they cannot wa&s;h out the foulne&s;s of
murder!&mdash;Yes, murder! Where is he&mdash;where
is he?&mdash;Look there&mdash;look there!&mdash;&s;ee
where he &s;talks along the room! Why
do you come to torment me now?" conti|nued
Agnes, while her &s;training eyes were
bent on air, "why was not I puni&s;hed be|fore?&mdash;O!
do not frown &s;o &s;ternly! Hah!
there again! 'tis &s;he her&s;elf! Why do you
look &s;o piteou&s;ly upon me&mdash;and &s;mile, too?
&s;mile on me! What groan was that?"</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358">
Agnes &s;unk down, apparently lifele&s;s,
and Emily, unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, leaned
again&s;t the bed, while the abbe&s;s and the
attendant nun were applying the u&s;ual re|medies
to Agnes. "Peace," &s;aid the ab|be&s;s,
when Emily was going to &s;peak,
"the delirium is going off, &s;he will &s;oon re|vive.
When was &s;he thus before, daugh|ter?"</P>
<P>"Not of many weeks, madam," re|plied
the nun,"but her &s;pirits have been
much agitated by the arrival of the gentle|man
&s;he wi&s;hed &s;o much to &s;ee."</P>
<P>"Yes," ob&s;erved the abbe&s;s, "that has
undoubtedly occa&s;ioned this paroxy&s;m of
frenzy. When &s;he is better, we will leave
her to repo&s;e."</P>
<P>Emily very readily con&s;ented, but, though
&s;he could now give little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he was
unwilling to quit the chamber, while any
might be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When Agnes recovered her &s;en&s;es, &s;he
again fixed her eyes on Emily, but their
wild expre&s;&s;ion was gone, and a gloomy me|lancholy
<PB N="353" REF="359">
had &s;ucceeded. It was &s;ome mo|ments
before &s;he recovered &s;ufficient &s;pirits
to &s;peak; &s;he then &s;aid feebly&mdash;"The
likene&s;s is wonderful!&mdash;&s;urely it mu&s;t be
&s;omething more than fancy. Tell me, I
conjure you," &s;he added, addre&s;&s;ing Emily,
"though your name is St. Aubert, are you
not the daughter of the Marchione&s;s?"
"What Marchione&s;s?" &s;aid Emily, in ex|treme
&s;urpri&s;e; for &s;he had imagined, from
the calmne&s;s of Agnes's manner, that her
intellects were re&s;tored, The abbe&s;s gave
her a &s;ignificant glance, but &s;he repeated
the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"What Marchione&s;s?" exclaimed Ag|nes,
"I know but of one&mdash;the Marchione&s;s
de Villeroi."</P>
<P>Emily, remembering the emotion of her
late father, upon the unexpected mention
of this lady, and his reque&s;t to be laid near
the tomb of the Villerois, now felt greatly
intere&s;ted, and &s;he entreated Agnes to ex|plain
the rea&s;on of her que&s;tion. The ab|be&s;s
would now have withdrawn Emily
<PB N="354" REF="360">
from the room, who being, however, de|tained
by a &s;trong intere&s;t, repeated her en|treaties.</P>
<P>"Bring me that ca&s;ket, &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Ag|nes;
"I will &s;hew her to you; yet you
need only look in that mirror, and you will
behold her; you &s;urely are her daughter:
&s;uch &s;triking re&s;emblance is never found
but among near relations."</P>
<P>The nun brought the ca&s;ket, and Agnes,
having directed her how to unlock it, &s;he
took thence a miniature, in which Emily
perceived the exact re&s;emblance of the pic|ture,
which &s;he had found among her late fa|ther's
papers. Agnes held out her hand to re|ceive
it; gazed upon it earne&s;tly for &s;ome
moments in &s;ilence; and then, with a counte|nance
of deep de&s;pair, threw up her eyes to
Heaven, and prayed inwardly. When &s;he
had fini&s;hed, &s;he returned the miniature to
Emily. "Keep it," &s;aid &s;he, "I bequeath
it to you, for I mu&s;t believe it is your
right. I have frequently ob&s;erved the re|&s;emblance
between you; but never, till this
<PB N="355" REF="361">
day, did it &s;trike upon my con&s;cience &s;o
powerfully! Stay, &s;i&s;ter, do not remove the
ca&s;ket&mdash;there is another picture I would
&s;hew."</P>
<P>Emily trembled with expectation, and
the abbe&s;s again would have withdrawn her.
"Agnes is &s;till di&s;ordered," &s;aid &s;he, "you
ob&s;erve how &s;he wanders. In the&s;e moods
&s;he &s;ays any thing, and does not &s;cruple,
as you have witne&s;&s;ed, to accu&s;e her&s;elf of
the mo&s;t horrible crimes."</P>
<P>Emily, however, thought &s;he perceived
&s;omething more than madne&s;s in the incon|&s;i&s;tencies
of Agnes, who&s;e mention of the
Marchione&s;s, and production of her picture,
had intere&s;ted her &s;o much, that &s;he deter|mined
to obtain further information, if po&s;|&s;ible,
re&s;pecting the &s;ubject of it.</P>
<P>The nun returned with the ca&s;ket, and,
Agnes pointing out to her a &s;ecret drawer,
&s;he took from it another miniature. "Here,"
&s;aid Agnes, as &s;he offered it to Emily,
"learn a le&s;&s;on for your vanity, at lea&s;t;
look well at this picture, and see if you can
<PB N="356" REF="362">
di&s;cover any re&s;emblance between what I
was, and what I am"</P>
<P>Emily impatiently received the miniature,
which her eyes had &s;carcely glanced upon,
before her trembling hands had nearly &s;uf|fered
it to fall&mdash;it was the re&s;emblance of
the portrait of Signora Laurentini, which
&s;he had formerly &s;een in the ca&s;tle of Udol|pho&mdash;the
lady, who had di&s;appeared in &s;o
my&s;terious a manner, and whom Montoni
had been &s;u&s;pected of having cau&s;ed to be
murdered.</P>
<P>In &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, Emily continued
to gaze alternately upon the picture and the
dying nun, endeavouring to trace a re&s;em|blance
between them, which no longer
exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>"Why do you look &s;o &s;ternly on me?"
&s;aid Agnes, mi&s;taking the nature of Emily's
emotion.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een this face before" &s;aid
Emily, at length; "was it really your
re|&s;emblance?"</P>
<P>"You may well a&s;k that que&s;tion," re|plied
<PB N="357" REF="363">
the nun,&mdash;"but it was once e&s;teemed
a &s;triking likene&s;s of me. Look at me
well, and &s;ee what guilt has made me. I
then was innocent; the evil pa&s;&s;ions of my
nature &s;lept. Si&s;ter!" added &s;he &s;olemnly,
and &s;tretching forth her cold, damp hand to
Emily, who &s;huddered at its touch&mdash;"Si&s;|ter!
beware of the fir&s;t indulgence of the
pa&s;&s;ions; beware of the fir&s;t! Their cour&s;e,
if not checked then, is rapid&mdash;their force is
uncontroulable&mdash;they lead us we know not
whither&mdash;they lead us perhaps to the
com|mi&s;&s;ion
of crimes, for which whole years of
prayer and penitence cannot atone!&mdash;Such
may be the force of even a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion,
that it overcomes every other, and &s;ears up
every other approach to the heart.
Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
us like a fiend, it leads us on to the
acts of a fiend, making us in&s;en&s;ible to pity
and to con&s;cience. And, when its purpo&s;e
is accompli&s;hed, like a fiend, it leaves us
to the torture of tho&s;e feelings, which its
power had &s;u&s;pended&mdash;not annihilated,&mdash;to
<PB N="358" REF="364">
the tortures of compa&s;&s;ion, remor&s;e, and
con&s;cience. Then, we awaken as from a
dream, and perceive a new world around us&mdash;we
gaze in a&s;toni&s;hment, and horror&mdash;but
the deed is committed; not all the powers
of heaven and earth united can undo it&mdash;and
the &s;pectres of con&s;cience will not fly!
What are riches&mdash;grandeur&mdash;health it&s;elf,
to the luxury of a pure con&s;cience, the
health of the &s;oul;&mdash;and what the &s;ufferings
of poverty, di&s;appointment, de&s;pair&mdash;to
the angui&s;h of an afflicted one! O! how
long is it &s;ince I knew that luxury! I be|lieved,
that I had &s;uffered the mo&s;t agoniz|ing
pangs of human nature, in love, jealou&s;y
and de&s;pair&mdash;but the&s;e pangs were ea&s;e,
compared with the &s;tings of con&s;cience,
which I have &s;ince endured. I ta&s;ted too
what was called the &s;weet of revenge&mdash;but it
was tran&s;ient, it expired even with the object,
that provoked it. Remember, &s;i&s;ter, that the
pa&s;&s;ions are the &s;eeds of vices as well as of
virtues, from which either may &s;pring, ac|cordingly
<PB N="359" REF="365">
as they are nurtured. Unhappy
they who have never been taught the art to
govern them"</P>
<P>"Alas! unhappy!" &s;aid the abbe&s;s,
"and ill-informed of our holy religion!"
Emily li&s;tened to Agnes, in &s;ilent awe,
while &s;he &s;till examined the miniature, and
became confirmed in her opinion of its
&s;trong re&s;emblance to the portrait at Udol|pho.
"This face is familiar to me" &s;aid
&s;he, wi&s;hing to lead the nun to an explana|tion,
yet fearing to di&s;cover too abruptly
her knowledge of Udolpho.</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken" replied Agnes,
"you certainly never &s;aw that picture be|fore."</P>
<P>"No," replied Emily, "but I have &s;een
one extremely like it" "Impo&s;&s;ible," said
Agnes, who may now be called the Lady
Laurentini.</P>
<P>"It was in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho" con|tinued
Emily, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at her.</P>
<P>"Of Udolpho!" exclaimed Laurentini,
<PB N="360" REF="366">
"of Udolpho in Italy!" "The &s;ame," re|plied
Emily.</P>
<P>"You know me then," &s;aid Laurentini,
"and you are the daughter of the Marchio|ne&s;s"
Emily was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at
this abrupt a&s;&s;ertion. "I am the daughter
of the late Mon&s;. St. Aubert," &s;aid &s;he;
"and the lady you name is an utter &s;tran|ger
to me."</P>
<P>"At lea&s;t you believe &s;o," rejoined Lau|rentini.</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked what rea&s;ons there could be
to believe otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>"The family likene&s;s, that yon bear her,"
&s;aid the nun. "The Marchione&s;s, it is
known, was attached to a gentleman of
Ga&s;cony, at the time when &s;he accepted the
hand of the Marquis, by the command of
her father. Ill-fated, unhappy woman!"</P>
<P>Emily, remembering the extreme emo|tion
which St. Aubert had betrayed on the
mention of the Marchione&s;s, would now
have &s;uffered &s;omething more than &s;urpri&s;e,
<PB N="361" REF="367">
had her confidence in his integrity been
le&s;s; as it was, &s;he could not, for a mo|ment,
believe what the words of Laurentini
in&s;inuated; yet &s;he &s;till felt &s;trongly inte|re&s;ted,
concerning them, and begged, that
&s;he would explain them further.</P>
<P>"Do not urge me on that &s;ubject" &s;aid
the nun, "it is to me a terrible one! Would
that I could blot it from my memory!"
She &s;ighed deeply, and, after the pau&s;e of a
moment, a&s;ked Emily, by what means &s;he
had di&s;covered her name?</P>
<P>"By your portrait in the ca&s;tle of Udol|pho,
to which this miniature bears a &s;triking
re&s;emblance" replied Emily.</P>
<P>"You have been at Udolpho then!"
&s;aid the nun, with great emotion. "Alas!
what &s;cenes does the mention of it revive in
my fancy&mdash;&s;cenes of happine&s;s&mdash;of &s;uffer|ing&mdash;and
of horror!"</P>
<P>At this moment, the terrible &s;pectacle,
which Emily had witne&s;&s;ed in a chamber of
that ca&s;ftle, occurred to her, and &s;he &s;hud|dered,
while &s;he looked upon the nun&mdash;
<PB N="362" REF="368">
and recollected her late words&mdash;that "years
of prayer and penitence could not wa&s;h out
the foulne&s;s of murder." She was now com|pelled
to attribute the&s;e to another cau&s;e,
than that of delirium. With a degree of
horror, that almo&s;t deprived her of &s;en&s;e,
&s;he now believed &s;he looked upon a mur|derer;
all the recollected behaviour of
Laurentini &s;eemed to confirm the &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
yet Emily was &s;till lo&s;t in a labyrinth
of perplexities, and, not knowing how to
a&s;k the que&s;tions, which might lead to
truth, &s;he could only hint them in broken
&s;entences.</P>
<P>"Your &s;udden departure from Udolpho"&mdash;&s;aid
&s;he.</P>
<P>Laurentini groaned.</P>
<P>"The reports that followed it," conti|nued
Emily&mdash;"The we&s;t chamber&mdash;the
mourning veil&mdash;the object it conceals!&mdash;when
murders are committed&mdash;"</P>
<P>The nun &s;hrieked, "What! there
again!" &s;aid &s;he, endeavouring to rai&s;e
her&s;elf, while her &s;tarting eyes &s;eemed to
<PB N="363" REF="369">
follow &s;ome object round the room&mdash;"Come
from the grave! What! Blood&mdash;blood
too!&mdash;There was no blood&mdash;thou
can&s;t not &s;ay it!&mdash;Nay, do not &s;mile,&mdash;do
not &s;mile &s;o piteou&s;ly!"</P>
<P>Laurentini fell into convul&s;ions, as &s;he
uttered the la&s;t words; and Emily, unable
any longer to endure the horror of the
&s;cene, hurried from the room, and &s;ent &s;ome
nuns to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, and the boarders, who
were in the parlour, now a&s;&s;embled round
Emily, and, alarmed by her manner and af|frighted
countenance, a&s;ked a hundred que&s;|tions,
which &s;he avoided an&s;wering further,
than by &s;aying, that &s;he believed &s;i&s;ter Ag|nes
was dying. They received this as a
&s;ufficient explanation of her terror, and had
then lei&s;ure to offer re&s;toratives, which, at
length, &s;omewhat revived Emily, who&s;e
mind was, however, &s;o much &s;hocked with
terrible &s;ur mi&s;es, and perplexed with doubts
by &s;ome words from the nun, that &s;he was
<PB N="364" REF="370">
unable to conver&s;e, and would have left the
convent immediately, had &s;he not wi&s;hed to
know whether Laurentini would &s;urvive the
late attack. After waiting &s;ome time, &s;he
was informed, that, the convul&s;ions having
cea&s;ed, Laurentini &s;eemed to be reviving,
and Emily and Blanche were departing,
when the abbe&s;s appeared, who, drawing
the former a&s;ide, &s;aid &s;he had &s;omething
of con&s;equence to &s;ay to her, but, as it
was late, &s;he would not detain her then, and
reque&s;ted to &s;ee her on the following day.</P>
<P>Emily promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her, and, having
taken leave, returned with the Lady Blanche
towards the chateau, on the way to which
the deep gloom of the woods made Blanche
lament, that the evening was &s;o far advanced;
for the &s;urrounding &s;tillne&s;s and ob&s;curity
rendered her &s;en&s;ible of fear, though there
was a &s;ervant to protect her; while Emily was
too much engaged by the horrors of the
&s;cene &s;he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, to be affected
by the &s;olemnity of the &s;hades, otherwi&s;e
<PB N="365" REF="371">
than as they &s;erved to promote her gloomy
reverie, from which, however, &s;he was at
length recalled by the Lady Blanche, who
pointed out, at &s;ome di&s;tance, in the du&s;ky
path they were winding, two per&s;ons &s;lowly
advancing. It was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid them
without &s;triking into a &s;till more &s;ecluded
part of the wood, whither the &s;trangers
might ea&s;ily follow; but all apprehen&s;ion
vani&s;hed, when Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed the
voice of Mon&s;. Du Pont, and perceived,
that his companion was the gentleman,
whom &s;he had &s;een at the mona&s;tery, and
who was now conver&s;ing with &s;o much ear|ne&s;tne&s;s
as not immediately to perceive
their approach. When Du Pont joined
the ladies, the &s;tranger took leave, and they
proceeded to the chateau, where the Count,
when he heard of Mon&s;. Bonnac, claimed
him for an acquaintance, and, on learning
the melancholy occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it to Lan|guedoc,
and that he was lodged at a &s;mall
inn in the village, begged the favour of
<PB N="366" REF="372">
Mon&s;. Du Pont to invite him to the
cha|teau.</P>
<P>The latter was happy to do &s;o, and the
&s;cruples of re&s;erve, which made M. Bonnac
he&s;itate to accept the invitation, being at
length overcome, they went to the chateau,
where the kindne&s;s of the Count and the
&s;prightline&s;s of his &s;on were exerted to
di&s;|&s;ipate the gloom, that overhung the &s;pirits
of the &s;tranger. M. Bonnac was an officer
in the French &s;ervice, and appeared to be
about fifty; his figure was tall and com|manding,
his manners had received the la&s;t
poli&s;h, and there was &s;omething in his coun|tenance
uncommonly intere&s;ting; for over
features, which, in youth, mu&s;t have been
remarkably hand&s;ome, was &s;pread a melan|choly,
that &s;eemed the effect of long mi&s;|fortune,
rather than of con&s;titution, or tem|per.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation he held, during &s;upper,
was evidently an effort of politene&s;s, and
there were intervals in which, unable to
<PB N="367" REF="373">
&s;truggle again&s;t the feelings, that depre&s;&s;ed
him, he relap&s;ed into &s;ilence and ab&s;trac|tion,
from which, however, the Count,
&s;ometimes, withdrew him in a manner
&s;o delicate and benevolent, that Emily,
while &s;he ob&s;erved him, almo&s;t fancied &s;he
beheld her late father.</P>
<P>The party &s;eparated, at an early hour,
and then, in the &s;olitude of her apartment,
the &s;cenes, which Emily had lately wit|ne&s;&s;ed,
returned to her fancy, with dreadful
energy. That in the dying nun &s;he &s;hould
have di&s;covered Signora Laurentini, who,
in&s;tead of having been murdered by Mon|toni,
was, as it now &s;eemed, her&s;elf guilty
of &s;ome dreadful crime, excited both horror
and &s;urpri&s;e in a high degree; nor did the
hints, which &s;he had dropped, re&s;pecting
the marriage of the Marchione&s;s de Vil|leroi,
and the enquiries &s;he had made con|cerning
Emily's birth, occa&s;ion her a le&s;s
degree of intere&s;t, though it was of a dif|ferent
nature.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory, which &s;i&s;ter Frances had for|merly
<PB N="368" REF="374">
related, and had &s;aid to be that of
Agnes, it now appeared, was erroneous; but
for what purpo&s;e it had been fabricated,
un|le&s;s the more effectually to conceal the true
&s;tory, Emily could not even gue&s;s. Above
all, her intere&s;t was excited as to the rela|tion,
which the &s;tory of the late Marchione&s;s
de Villeroi bore to that of her father; for,
that &s;ome kind of relation exi&s;ted between
them, the grief of St. Aubert, upon hear|ing
her named, his reque&s;t to be buried
near her, and her picture, which had been
&s;ound among his papers, certainly proved.
Sometimes it occurred to Emily, that he
might have been the lover, to whom it was
&s;aid the Marchione&s;s was attached, when &s;he
was compelled to marry the Marquis de
Villeroi; but that he had afterwards Che|ri&s;hed
a pa&s;&s;ion for her, &s;he could not &s;uffer
her&s;elf to believe, for a moment. The pa|pers,
which he had &s;o &s;olemnly enjoined
her to de&s;troy, &s;he now fancied had related
to this connection, and &s;he wi&s;hed more
earne&s;tly than before to know the rea&s;ons,
<PB N="369" REF="375">
that made him con&s;ider the injunction nece&s;&s;ary,
which, had her faith in his princi|ples
been le&s;s, would have led to believe,
that there was a my&s;tery in her birth di&s;ho|nourable
to her parents, which tho&s;e manu|&s;cripts
might have revealed.</P>
<P>Reflections, &s;imilar to the&s;e, engaged her
mind, during the greater part of the night,
and when, at length, &s;he fell into a &s;lumber,
it was only to behold a vi&s;ion of the dying
nun, and to awaken in horrors, like tho&s;e
&s;he had witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he was too
much indi&s;po&s;ed to attend her appointment
with the abbe&s;s, and, before the day con|cluded,
&s;he heard, that &s;i&s;ter Agnes was no
more. Mon&s;. Bonnac received this intelli|gence,
with concern; but Emily ob&s;erved,
that he did not appear &s;o much affected
now, as on the preceding evening, imme|diately
after quitting the apartment of the
nun, who&s;e death was probably le&s;s terrible
to him, than the confe&s;&s;ion he had been
then called upon to witne&s;s. However this
<PB N="370" REF="376">
might be, he was perhaps con&s;oled, in &s;ome
degree, by a knowledge of the legacy be|queathed
him, &s;ince his family was large,
and the extravagance of &s;ome part of it
had lately been the means of involving
him in great di&s;tre&s;s, and even in the hor|rors
of a pri&s;on; and it was the grief he
had &s;uffered from the wild career of a
favourite &s;on, with the pecuniary anxie|ties
and misfortunes con&s;equent upon it,
that had given to his countenance the air
of dejection, which had &s;o much intere&s;ted
Emily.</P>
<P>To his friend Mon&s;. Du Pont he recited
&s;ome particulars of his late &s;ufferings, when
it appeared, that he had been con&s;ined for
&s;everal months in one of the pri&s;ons of Pa|ris,
with little hope of relea&s;e, and without
the comfort of &s;eeing his wife, who had
been ab&s;ent in the country, endeavouring,
though in vain, to procure a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
his friends. When, at length, &s;he had ob|tained
an order for admittance, &s;he was &s;o
much &s;hocked at the change, which long
<PB N="371" REF="377">
con&s;inement and &s;orrow had made in his
ap|pearance,
that &s;he was &s;eized with &s;its,
which, by their long continuance, threatened
her life.</P>
<P>"Our &s;ituation affected tho&s;e, who hap|pened
to witne&s;s it," continued Mon&s;. Bon|nac,
"and one generous friend, who was
in con&s;inement at the &s;ame time, afterwards
employed the fir&s;t moments of his liberty
in efforts to obtain mine. He &s;ucceeded;
the heavy debt, that oppre&s;&s;ed me, was di&s;|charged;
and, when I would have expre&s;&s;ed
my &s;en&s;e of the obligation I had received,
my benefactor was fled from my &s;earch. I
have rea&s;on to believe he was the victim of
his own genero&s;ity, and that he returned to
the &s;tate of con&s;inement, from which he had
relea&s;ed me; but every enquiry after him
was un&s;ucce&s;sful. Amiable and unfortu|nate
Valancourt!"</P>
<P>"Valancourt!" exclaimed Mon&s;. Du
Pont. "Of what family?"</P>
<P>"The Valancourts, Counts Duvarney," replied Mon&s;. Bonnac.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="378">
The emotion of Mon&s;. Du Pont, when
he di&s;covered the generous benefactor of
his friend to be the rival of his love, can
only be imagined; but, having overcome
his fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, he di&s;&s;ipated the appre|hen&s;ions
of Mon&s;. Bonnac by acquainting
him, that Valancourt was at liberty, and
had lately been in Languedoc; after which
his affection for Emily prompted him to
make &s;ome enquiries, re&s;pecting the conduct
of his rival, during his &s;tay at Paris, of
which M. Bonnac appeared to be well in|formed.
The an&s;wers he received were
&s;uch as convinced him, that Valancourt
had been much mi&s;repre&s;ented, and, painful
as was the &s;acrifice, he formed the ju&s;t de|&s;ign
of relinqui&s;hing his pur&s;uit of Emily
to a lover, who, it now appeared, was not
unworthy of the regard, with which &s;he ho|noured
him.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of Mon&s;. Bonnac di&s;|covered,
that Valancourt, &s;ome time after
his arrival at Paris, had been drawn into
the &s;nares, which determined vice had &s;pread
<PB N="373" REF="379">
for him, and that his hours had been chiefly
divided between the parties of the captivat|ing
Marchione&s;s and tho&s;e gaming a&s;&s;emblies,
to which the envy, or the avarice, of his bro|ther
officers had &s;pared no art to &s;educe him.
In the&s;e parties he had lo&s;t large &s;ums, in ef|forts
to recover &s;mall ones, and to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es
the Count De Villefort and Mon&s;. Henri
had been frequent witne&s;&s;es. His re&s;ources
were, at length, exhau&s;ted; and the Count,
his brother, exa&s;perated by his conduct, re|fu&s;ed
to continue the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary to
his pre&s;ent mode of life, when Valancourt,
in con&s;equence of accumulated debts, was
thrown into con&s;inement, where his brother
&s;uffered him to remain, in the hope, that
puni&s;hment might effect a reform of
con|duct,
which had not yet been confirmed by
long habit.</P>
<P>In the &s;olitude of his pri&s;on, Valancourt
had lei&s;ure for reflection, and cau&s;e for re|pentance;
here, too, the image of Emily,
which, amid&s;t the di&s;&s;ipation of the city
had been ob&s;cured, but never obliterated
<PB N="374" REF="380">
from his heart, revived with all the charms
of innocence and beauty, to reproach him
for having &s;acrificed his happine&s;s and de|ba&s;ed
his talents by pur&s;uits, which his no|bler
faculties would formerly have taught
him to con&s;ider were as ta&s;tele&s;s as they
were degrading. But, though his pa&s;&s;ions
had been &s;educed, his heart was not de|praved,
nor had habit riveted the chains,
that hung heavily on his con&s;cience; and,
as he retained that energy of will, which
was nece&s;&s;ary to bur&s;t them, he, at length,
emancipated him&s;elf from the bondage of
vice, but not till after much effort and &s;e|vere
&s;uffering.</P>
<P>Being relea&s;ed by his brother from the
pri&s;on, where he had witne&s;&s;ed the affecting
meeting between Mon&s;. Bonnac and his
wife, with whom he had been for &s;ome time
acquainted, the fir&s;t u&s;e of his liberty formed
a &s;triking in&s;tance of his humanity and his
ra&s;hne&s;s; for with nearly all the money,
ju&s;t received from his brother, he went to a
gaming-hou&s;e, and gave it as a la&s;t &s;take
<PB N="375" REF="381">
for the chance of re&s;toring his friend to
freedom, and to his afflicted family. The
event was fortunate, and, while he had
awaited the i&s;&s;ue of this momentous &s;take,
he made a &s;olemn vow never again to yield
to the de&s;tructive and fa&s;cinating vice of
gaming.</P>
<P>Having re&s;tored the venerable Mon&s;.
Bonnac to his rejoicing family, he hurried
from Paris to E&s;tuviere; and, in the de|light
of having made the wretched happy,
forgot, for a while, his own misfortunes.
Soon, however, he remembered, that he had
thrown away the fortune, without which he
could never hope to marry Emily; and life,
unle&s;s pa&s;&s;ed with her, now &s;carcely ap|peared
&s;upportable; for her goodne&s;s, re|&s;inement,
and &s;implicity of heart, rendered
her beauty more enchanting, if po&s;&s;ible, to
his fancy, than it had ever yet appeared.
Experience had taught him to under&s;tand
the full value of the qualities, which he
had before admired, but which the con|trasted
characters he had &s;een in the world
<PB N="376" REF="382">
made him now adore; and the&s;e reflections,
increa&s;ing the pangs of remor&s;e and regret,
occa&s;ioned the deep dejection, that had ac|companied
him even into the pre&s;ence of
Emily, of whom he con&s;idered him&s;elf no
longer worthy. To the ignominy of having
received pecuniary obligations from the
Marchione&s;s Chamfort, or any other lady of
intrigue, as the Count De Villefort had been
informed, or of having been engaged in the
depredating &s;chemes of game&s;ters, Valan|court
had never &s;ubmitted; and the&s;e were
&s;ome of &s;uch &s;candals as often mingle
with truth, again&s;t the unfortunate. Count
De Villefort had received them from au|thority,
which he had no rea&s;on to doubt,
and which the imprudent conduct he had
him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed in Valancourt, had cer|tainly
induced him the more readily to be|lieve.
Being &s;uch as Emily could not
name to the Chevalier, he had no opportu|nity
of refuting them; and, when he con|fe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to be unworthy of her e&s;teem,
he little &s;u&s;pected, that he was confirming
<PB N="377" REF="383">
to her the mo&s;t dreadful calumnies. Thus
the mi&s;take had been mutual, and had re|mained
&s;o, when Mon&s;. Bonnac explained
the conduct of his generous, but impru|dent
young friend to Du Pont, who, with
&s;evere ju&s;tice, determined not only to unde|ceive
the Count on this &s;ubject, but to re|&s;ign
all hope of Emily. Such a &s;acrifice as
his love rendered this, was de&s;erving of a
noble reward, and Mon&s;. Bonnac, if it had
been po&s;&s;ible for him to forget the benevo|lent
Valancourt, would have wi&s;hed that
Emily might accept the ju&s;t Du Pont.</P>
<P>When the Count was informed of the
error he had committed, he was extremely
&s;hocked at the con&s;equence of his credu|lity,
and the account which Mon&s;. Bonnac
gave of his friend's &s;ituation, while at Paris,
convinced him, that Valancourt had been
entrapped by the &s;chemes of a &s;et of di&s;&s;i|pated
young men, with whom his profe&s;|&s;ion
had partly obliged him to a&s;&s;ociate,
rather than by an inclination to vice; and,
charmed by the humanity, and noble, though
<PB N="378" REF="384">
ra&s;h genero&s;ity, which his conduct towards
Mon&s;. Bonnac exhibited, he forgave him
the tran&s;ient errors, that had &s;tained his
youth, and re&s;tored him to the high degree
of e&s;teem, with which he had regarded him,
during their early acquaintance. But, as
the lea&s;t reparation he could now make Va|lancourt
was to afford him an opportunity
of explaining to Emily his former conduct,
he immediately wrote, to reque&s;t his for|givene&s;s
of the unintentional injury he had
done him, and to invite him to Chateau-le|Blanc.
Motives of delicacy with-held the
Count from informing Emily of this letter,
and of kindne&s;s from acquainting her with
the di&s;covery re&s;pecting Valancourt, till his
arrival &s;hould &s;ave her from the po&s;&s;ibility
of anxiety, as to its event; and this precau|tion
&s;pared her even &s;everer inquietude, than
the Count had fore&s;een, &s;ince he was igno|rant
of the &s;ymptoms of de&s;pair, which Va|lancourt's
late conduct had betrayed.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOME circum&s;tances of an extraordinary
nature now withdrew Emily from her own
&s;orrows, and excited emotions, which par|took
of both &s;urpri&s;e and horror.</P>
<P>A few days following that, on which
Signora Laurentini died, her will was opened
at the mona&s;tery, in the pre&s;ence of the &s;u|periors
and Mon&s;. Bonnac, when it was
found, that one third of her per&s;onal pro|perty
was bequeathed to the neare&s;t &s;urviv|ing
relative of the late Marchione&s;s de Vil|leroi,
and that Emily was the per&s;on.</P>
<P>With the &s;ecret of Emily's family the
abbe&s;s had long been acquainted, and it was
<PB N="280" REF="386">
in ob&s;ervance of the earne&s;t reque&s;t of St.
Aubert, who was known to the friar, that
attended him on his death bed, that his
daughter had remained in ignorance of her
relation&s;hip to the Marchione&s;s. But &s;ome
hints, which had fallen from Signora Lau|rentini,
during her la&s;t interview with Emily,
and a confe&s;&s;ion of a very extraordinary na|ture,
given in her dying hours, had made
the abbe&s;s think it nece&s;&s;ary to conver&s;e
with her young friend, on the topic &s;he had
not before ventured to introduce; and it
was for this purpo&s;e, that &s;he had reque&s;ted
to &s;ee her on the morning that followed
her interview with the nun. Emily's indi&s;|po&s;ition
had then prevented the intended
conver&s;ation; but now, after the will had
been examined, &s;he received a &s;ummons,
which &s;he immediately obeyed, and became
informed of circum&s;tances, that powerfully
affected her. As the narrative of the ab|be&s;s
was, however, deficient in many parti|culars,
of which the reader may wi&s;h to be
informed, and the hi&s;tory of the nun is ma|terially

connected with the fate of the Mar|chione&s;s

brief hi&s;tory of</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO,</HEAD>
<P>Who was the only child of her parents,
and heire&s;s of the ancient hou&s;e of Udol|pho,
in the territory of Venice. It was the
fir&s;t misfortune of her life, and that which
led to all her &s;ucceeding mi&s;ery, that the
friends, who ought to have re&s;trained her
&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and mildly in&s;tructed her
in the art of governing them, nurtured
them by early indulgence. But they che|ri&s;hed
their own failings in her; for their
conduct was not the re&s;ult of rational kind|ne&s;s,
and, when they either indulged, or
oppo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ions of their child, they
gratified their own. Thus they indulged
her with weaken&s;s, and reprehended her
with violence; her &s;pirit was exa&s;perated
by their vehemence, in&s;tead of being cor|rected
<PB N="382" REF="388">
by their wi&s;dom; and their oppo|&s;itions
became conte&s;ts for victory, in
which the due tenderne&s;s of the parents,
and the affectionate duties of the child,
were equally forgotten; but, as returning
fondne&s;s di&s;armed the parents' re&s;ent|ment
&s;oone&s;t, Laurentini was &s;uffered to
believe that &s;he had conquered, and her
pa&s;&s;ions became &s;tronger by every effort,
that had been, employed to &s;ubdue them.</P>
<P>The death of her father and mother in
the &s;ame year left her to her own di&s;cretion,
under the dangerous circum&s;tances attend|ant
on youth and beauty. She was fond
of company, delighted with admiration, yet
di&s;dainful of the opinion of the world,
when it happened to contradict her incli|nations;
had a gay and brilliant wit, and
was mi&s;tre&s;s of all the arts of fa&s;cination.
Her conduct was &s;uch as might have been
expected, from the weaken&s;s of her prin|ciples
and the &s;trength of her pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Among her numerous admirers was the
late Marquis de Villeroi, who, on his tour
<PB N="383" REF="389">
through Italy, &s;aw Laurentini at Venice,
where &s;he u&s;ually re&s;ided, and became her
pa&s;&s;ionate adorer. Equally captivated by
the figure and accompli&s;hments of the
Marquis, who was at that period one of
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed noblemen of the
French court, &s;he had the art &s;o effectually
to conceal from him the dangerous traits
of her character and the blemi&s;hes of her
late conduct, that he &s;olicited her hand in
marriage.</P>
<P>Before the nuptials were concluded, &s;he
retired to the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, whither
the Marquis followed, and, where her con|duct,
relaxing from the propriety, which
&s;he had lately a&s;&s;umed, di&s;covered to him the
precipice, on which he &s;tood. A mi|nuter
enquiry than he had before thought
it nece&s;&s;ary to make, convinced him, that
he had been deceived in her character, and
&s;he, whom he had de&s;igned for his wife, af|terwards
became his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks at Udol|pho,
he was called abruptly to France,
<PB N="384" REF="390">
whither he returned with extreme reluc|tance,
for his heart was &s;till fa&s;cinated by
the arts of Laurentini, with whom, how|ever,
he had on various pretences delayed
his marriage; but, to reconcile her to this
&s;eparation, he now gave repeated promi&s;es
of returning to conclude the nuptials, as
&s;oon as the affair, which thus &s;uddenly
called him to France, &s;hould permit.</P>
<P>Soothed, in &s;ome degree, by the&s;e a&s;&s;ur|ances,
&s;he &s;uffered him to depart; and,
&s;oon after, her relative, Montoni, arriving
at Udolpho, renewed the addre&s;&s;es, which
&s;he had before refu&s;ed, and which &s;he now
again rejected. Meanwhile, her thoughts
were con&s;tantly with the Marquis de Ville|roi,
for whom &s;he &s;uffered all the delirium
of Italian love, cheri&s;hed by the &s;olitude, to
which &s;he con&s;ined her&s;elf; for &s;he had now
lo&s;t all ta&s;te for the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety
and the gaiety of amu&s;ement. Her only
indulgences were to &s;igh and weep over a
miniature of the Marquis; to vi&s;it the
&s;cenes, that had witne&s;&s;ed their happine&s;s,
<PB N="385" REF="391">
to pour forth her heart to him in writing,
and to count the weeks, the days, which
mu&s;t intervene before the period that he
had mentioned as probable for his return.
But this period pa&s;&s;ed without bringing him;
and week after week followed in heavy and
almo&s;t intolerable expectation. During this
interval, Laurentini's fancy, occupied in|ce&s;&s;antly
by one idea, became di&s;ordered;
and, her whole heart being devoted to one
object, life became hateful to her, when
&s;he believed that object lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Several months pa&s;&s;ed, during which &s;he
heard nothing from the Marquis de Ville|roi,
and her days were marked, at inter|vals,
with the phren&s;y of pa&s;&s;ion and the
fullenne&s;s of de&s;pair. She &s;ecluded her|&s;elf
from all vi&s;itors, and, &s;ometimes, re|mained
in her apartment, for weeks toge|ther,
refu&s;ing to &s;peak to every per&s;on, ex|cept
her favourite female attendant, writing
&s;craps of letters, reading, again and again,
tho&s;e &s;he had received from the Marquis,
<PB N="386" REF="392">
weeping over his picture, and &s;peaking to
it, for many hours, upbraiding, reproach|ing
and care&s;&s;ing it alternately.</P>
<P>At length, a report reached her, that
the Marquis had married in France, and,
after &s;uffering all the extremes of love, jea|lou&s;y
and indignation, &s;he formed the de|&s;perate
re&s;olution of going &s;ecretly to that
country, and, if the report proved true, of
attempting a deep revenge. To her favour|ite
woman only &s;he con&s;ided the plan of
her journey, and &s;he engaged her to par|take
of it. Having collected her jewels,
which, de&s;cending to her from many
branches of her family, were of immen&s;e
value, and all her ca&s;h, to a very large
amount, they were packed in a trunk,
which was privately conveyed to a neigh|bouring
town, whither Laurentini, with
this only &s;ervant, followed, and thence pro|ceeded
&s;ecretly to Leghorn, where they em|oarked
for France.</P>
<P>When, on her arrival in Languedoc, &s;he
found, that the Marquis de Villeroi had
<PB N="387" REF="393">
been married, for &s;ome months, her de|&s;pair
almo&s;t deprived her of rea&s;on, and &s;he
alternately projected and abandoned the
horrible de&s;ign of murdering the Marquis,
his wife and her&s;elf. At length &s;he con|trived
to throw her&s;elf in his way, with
an intention of reproaching him, for his
conduct, and of &s;tabbing her&s;elf in his pre|&s;ence;
but, when &s;he again &s;aw him, who
&s;o long had been the con&s;tant object of her
thoughts and affections, re&s;entment yielded
to love; her re&s;olution failed; &s;he trem|bled
with the conflict of emotions, that a&s;|&s;ailed
her heart, and fainted away.</P>
<P>The Marquis was not proof again&s;t her
beauty and &s;en&s;ibility; all the energy,
with which he had fir&s;t loved, returned,
for his pa&s;&s;ion had been re&s;i&s;ted by pru|dence,
rather than overcome by indifference;
and, &s;ince the honour of his family would
not permit him to marry her, he had endea|voured
to &s;ubdue his love, and had &s;o far
&s;ucceeded, as to &s;elect the then Marchione&s;s
for his wife, whom he loved at fir&s;t with a
<PB N="388" REF="394">
tempered and rational affection. But the
mild virtues of that amiable lady did not
recompen&s;e him for her indifference, which
appeared, notwith&s;tanding her efforts to
conceal it; and he had, for &s;ome time, &s;u&s;|pected
that her affections were engaged by
another per&s;on, when Laurentini arrived in
Languedoc. This artful Italian &s;oon per|ceived,
that &s;he had regained her influence
over him, and, &s;oothed by the di&s;covery,
&s;he determined to live, and to employ all
her enchantments to win his con&s;ent to the
diabolical deed, which &s;he believed was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to the &s;ecurity of her happine&s;s.
She conducted her &s;cheme with deep dis&s;i|mulation
and patient per&s;everance, and,
having completely e&s;tranged the affections
of the Marquis from his wife, who&s;e gentle
goodne&s;s and unimpa&s;&s;ioned manners had
cea&s;ed to plea&s;e, when contra&s;ted with the
captivations of the Italian, &s;he proceeded
to awaken in his mind the jealou&s;y of pride,
for it was no longer that of love, and even
pointed out to him the per&s;on, to whom
<PB N="389" REF="395">
&s;he affirmed the Marchione&s;s had &s;acrificed
her honour; but Laurentini had fir&s;t ex|torted
from him a &s;olemn promi&s;e to for|bear
avenging him&s;elf upon his rival. This
was an important part of her plan, for &s;he
knew, that, if his de&s;ire of vengeance was
re&s;trained towards one party, it would burn
more fiercely towards the other, and he
might then, perhaps, be prevailed on to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in the horrible act, which would re|lea&s;e
him from the only barrier, that with|held
him from making her his wife.</P>
<P>The innocent Marchione&s;s, meanwhile,
ob&s;erved, with extreme grief, the alteration
in her hu&s;band's manners. He became re|&s;erved
and thoughful in her pre&s;ence; his
conduct was au&s;tere, and &s;ometimes even
rude; and he left her, for many hours
together, to weep for his unkindne&s;s; and
to form plans for the recovery of his affec|tion.
His conduct afflicted her the more,
becau&s;e, in obedience to the command of
her father, &s;he had accepted his hand,
though her affections were engaged to ano|ther,
who&s;e amiable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he had rea|&s;on
<PB N="390" REF="396">
to believe, would have en&s;ured her hap|pine&s;s.
This circum&s;tance Laurentini had
di&s;covered, &s;oon after her arrival in France,
and had made ample u&s;e of it in a&s;&s;i&s;ting
her de&s;igns upon the Marquis, to whom &s;he
adduced &s;uch &s;eeming proof of his wife's
infidelity, that, in the frantic rage of
wounded honour, he con&s;ented to de&s;troy
his wife. A &s;low poi&s;on was admini&s;tered,
and &s;he fell a victim to the jealou&s;y and
&s;ubtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty
weakne&s;s of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But the moment of Laurentini's triumph,
the moment, to which &s;he had looked for|ward
for the completion of all her wi&s;hes,
proved only the commencement of a &s;uffer|ing,
that never left her to her dying hour.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of revenge, which had in part
&s;timulated her to the commi&s;&s;ion of this
atrocious deed, died, even at the moment
when it was gratified, and left her to the hor|rors
of unavailing pity and remor&s;e, which
would probably have empoi&s;oned all the
years &s;he had promi&s;ed her&s;elf with the
<PB N="391" REF="397">
Marquis de Villeroi, had her expectations
of an alliance with him been realized. But
he, too, had found the moment of his re|venge
to be that of remor&s;e, as to him&s;elf,
and dete&s;tation, as to the partner of his
crime; the feeling, which he had mi&s;taken
for conviction, was no more; and he &s;tood
a&s;toni&s;hed, and agha&s;t, that no proof re|mained
of his wife's infidelity, now that &s;he
had &s;uffered the puni&s;hment of guilt. Even
when he was informed, that &s;he was dying,
he had felt &s;uddenly and unaccountably re|a&s;&s;ured
of her innocence, nor was the &s;olemn
a&s;&s;urance &s;he made him in her la&s;t hour, ca|pable
of affording him a &s;tronger conviction
of her blamele&s;s conduct.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t horrors of remor&s;e and de&s;pair,
he felt inclined to deliver up him&s;elf and
the woman, who had plunged him into this
aby&s;s of guilt, into the hands of ju&s;tice; but,
when the paroxy&s;m of his &s;uffering was
over, his intention changed. Laurentini,
however, he &s;aw only once afterwards, and
that was, to cur&s;e her as the in&s;tigator of his
<PB N="392" REF="398">
crime, and to &s;ay, that he &s;pared her life
only on condition, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t
of her days in prayer and penance. Over|whelmed
with, di&s;appointment, on receiving
contempt and abhorrence from the man, for
who&s;e &s;ake &s;he had not &s;crupled to &s;tain her
con&s;cience with human blood, and, touched
with horror of the unavailing crime &s;he had
committed, &s;he renounced the world, and
retired to the mona&s;tery of St. Claire, a
dreadful victim to unre&s;i&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Marquis, immediately after the death
of his wife, quitted Chateau-le-Blanc, to
which he never returned, and endeavoured
to lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of his crime amid&s;t the tu|mult
of war, or the di&s;&s;ipations of a capital;
but his efforts were vain; a deep dejection
hung over him ever after, for which his
mo&s;t intimate friends could not account,
and he, at length, died, with a degree of
horror nearly equal to that, which Lauren|tini
had &s;uffered. The phy&s;ician, who had
ob&s;erved the &s;ingular appearance of the un|fortunate
Marchione&s;s, after death, had been
<PB N="393" REF="399">
bribed to &s;ilence; and, as the &s;urmi&s;es of a
few of the &s;ervants had proceeded no further
than a whi&s;per, the affair had never been
inve&s;tigated. Whether this whi&s;per ever
reached the father of the Marchione&s;s, and,
if it did, whether the difficulty of obtaining
proof deterred him from pro&s;ecuting the
Marquis de Villeroi, is uncertain; but her
death was deeply lamented by &s;ome part of
her family, and particularly by her brother,
M. St. Aubert; for that was the degree of re|lation&s;hip,
which had exi&s;ted between Emily's
father and the Marchione&s;s; and there is no
doubt, that he &s;u&s;pected the manner of her
death. Many letters pa&s;&s;ed between the
Marquis and him, &s;oon after the decea&s;e
of this beloved &s;i&s;ter, the &s;ubject of which
was not known, but there is rea&s;on to be|lieve,
that they related to the cau&s;e of her
death; and the&s;e were the papers, together
with &s;ome letters of the Marchione&s;s, who
had con&s;ided to her brother the occa&s;ion of
her unhappine&s;s, which St. Aubert had &s;o
&s;olemnly enjoined his daughter to de&s;troy:
<PB N="394" REF="400">
and anxiety for her peace had probably made
him forbid her to enquire into the melan|choly
&s;tory, to which they alluded. Such,
indeed, had been his affliction, on the pre|mature
death of this his favourite &s;i&s;ter,
who&s;e unhappy marriage had from the fir&s;t
excited his tendere&s;t pity, that he never
could hear her named, or mention her him|&s;elf
after her death, except to Madame St.
Aubert. From Emily, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility he
feared to awaken, he had &s;o carefully con|cealed
her hi&s;tory and name, that &s;he was
ignorant, till now, that &s;he ever had &s;uch a
relative as the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi; and
from this motive he had enjoined &s;ilence to
his only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter, Madame Cheron,
who had &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>It was over &s;ome of the la&s;t pathetic let|ters
of the Marchione&s;s, that St. Aubert was
weeping, when he was ob&s;erved by Emily,
on the eye of her departure from La Vall&eacute;e,
and it was her picture, which he had &s;o ten|derly
care&s;&s;ed. Her di&s;a&s;trous death may
account for the emotion he had betrayed, on
<PB N="395" REF="401">
hearing her named by La Voi&s;in, and for
his reque&s;t to be interred near the monu|ment
of the Villerois, where her remains
were depo&s;ited, but not tho&s;e of her hu&s;band,
who was buried, where he died, in the north
of France.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;or, who attended St. Aubert
in his la&s;t moments, recollected him to be
the brother of the late Marchione&s;s, when
St. Aubert, from tenderne&s;s to Emily, had
conjured him to conceal the circum&s;tance,
and to reque&s;t that the abbe&s;s, to who&s;e care
he particularly recommended her, would do
the &s;ame; a reque&s;t, which had been exactly
ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Laurentini, on her arrival in France, had
carefully concealed her name and family,
and, the better to di&s;gui&s;e her real hi&s;tory,
had, on entering the convent, cau&s;ed the
&s;tory to be circulated, which had impo&s;ed,
on &s;i&s;ter Frances, and it is probable, that the
abbe&s;s, who did not pre&s;ide in the convent,
at the time of her noviciation, was al&s;o en|tirely
ignorant of the truth. The deep re|mor&s;e
<PB N="396" REF="402">
that &s;eized on the mind of Laurentini,
together with the &s;ufferings of di&s;appointed
pa&s;&s;ion, for &s;he &s;till loved the Marquis, again
un&s;ettled her intellects, and, after the fir&s;t
paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair were pa&s;&s;ed, a heavy
and &s;ilent melancholy, had &s;ettled upon her
&s;pirits, which &s;uffered few interruptions from
fits of phren&s;y, till the time of her death.
During many years, it had been her only
amu&s;ement to walk in the woods near the
mona&s;tery, in the &s;olitary hours of night,
and to play upon a favourite in&s;trument, to
which &s;he &s;ometimes joined. the delightful
melody of her voice, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and
melancholy airs of her native country, mo|dulated
by all the energetic feeling, that
dwelt in her heart. The phy&s;ician, who had
attended her, recommended it to the &s;upe|rior
to indulge her in this whim, as the only
means of &s;oothing her di&s;tempered fancy;
and &s;he was &s;uffered to walk in the lonely
hours of night, attended by the &s;ervant, who
had accompanied her from Italy; but, as
the indulgence tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the rules
<PB N="397" REF="403">
of the convent, it was kept as &s;ecret as po&s;|&s;ible;
and thus the my&s;terious mu&s;ic of
Laurentini had combined with other cir|cum&s;tances,
to produce a report, that not
only the chateau, but its neighbourhood,
was haunted.</P>
<P>Soon after her entrance into this holy
community, and before &s;he had &s;hewn any
&s;ymptoms of in&s;anity there, &s;he made a will,
in which, after bequeathing a con&s;iderable
legacy to the convent, &s;he divided the re|mainder
of her per&s;onal property, which
her jewels made very valuable, between the
wife of Mon&s;. Bonnac, who was an Italian
lady and her relation, and the neare&s;t &s;ur|viving
relative of the late Marchione&s;s de
Villeroi. As Emily St. Aubert was not
only the neare&s;t, but the &s;ole relative, this
legacy de&s;cended to her, and thus explained
to her the whole my&s;tery of her father's
conduct.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance between Emily and her
unfortunate aunt had frequently been ob|&s;erved
by Laurentini, and had occa&s;ioned
<PB N="318" REF="404">
the &s;ingular behaviour, which had formerly
alarmed her; but it was in the nun's dy|ing
hour, when her con&s;cience gave her
perpetually the idea of the Marchio|ne&s;s,
that &s;he became more &s;en&s;ible, than
ever, of this likene&s;s, and, in her phren&s;y,
deemed it no re&s;emblance of the per&s;on &s;he
had injured, but the original her&s;elf. The
bold a&s;&s;ertion, that had followed, on the
recovery of her &s;en&s;es, that Emily was the
daughter of the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi,
aro&s;e from a &s;u&s;picion that &s;he was &s;o;
for, knowing that her rival, when &s;he mar|ried
the Marquis, was attached to another
lover, &s;he had &s;carcely &s;crupled to believe,
that her honour had been &s;acrificed, like
her own, to an unre&s;i&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of a crime, however, to which Emily
had &s;u&s;pected, from her phren&s;ied confe&s;&s;ion
of murder, that &s;he had been in&s;trumental
in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, Laurentini was
innocent; and &s;he had her&s;elf been deceiv|ed,
concerning the &s;pectacle, that formerly
occa&s;ioned her &s;o much terror, arid had
<PB N="399" REF="405">
&s;ince compelled her, for a while, to attri|bute
the horrors of the nun to a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of a murder, committed in that ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that, in a cham|ber
of Udolpho, hung a black veil, who&s;e
&s;ingular &s;ituation had excited Emily's curio|&s;ity,
and which afterwards di&s;clo&s;ed an ob|ject,
that had overwhelmed her with horror;
for, on lifting it, there appeared, in&s;tead of
the picture &s;he had expected, within a re|ce&s;s
of the wall, a human figure of gha&s;tly
palene&s;s, &s;tretched at its length, and dre&s;&s;ed
in the habiliments of the grave. What added
to the horror of the &s;pectacle, was, that the
face appeared partly decayed and disfigured
by worms, which were vi&s;ible. on the fea|tures
and hands. On &s;uch an object, it will
be readily believed, that no per&s;on could
endure to look twice. Emily, it may be re|collected,
had, after the fir&s;t glance, let the
veil drop, and her terror had prevented her
from ever after provoking a renewal of &s;uch
&s;uffering, as &s;he had then experienced.
<PB N="400" REF="406">
Had &s;he dared to look again, her delu&s;ion
and her fears would have vani&s;hed together,
and &s;he would have perceived, that the figure
before her was not human, but formed of wax.
The hi&s;tory of it is &s;omewhat extraordinary,
though not without example in the records
of that fierce &s;everity, which monki&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition
has &s;ometimes inflicted on man|kind.
A member of the hou&s;e of Udolpho,
having committed &s;ome offence again&s;t the
prerogative of the church, had been con|demned
to the penance of contemplating,
during certain hours of the day, a waxen
image, made to re&s;emble a human body in
the &s;tate, to which it is reduced after death.
This penance, &s;erving as a memento of the
condition at which he mu&s;t him&s;elf arrive,
had been de&s;igned to reprove the pride of
the Marquis of Udolpho, which had for|merly
&s;o much exa&s;perated that of the
Romi&s;h church; and he had not only &s;u|per&s;titiou&s;ly
ob&s;erved this penance him&s;elf,
which, he had believed, was to obtain a
<PB N="401" REF="407">
pardon for all his &s;ins, but had made it a
condition in his will, that his de&s;cendants
&s;hould pre&s;erve the image, on pain of for|feiting
to the church a certain part of his
domain, that they al&s;o might profit by the
humiliating moral it conveyed. The figure,
therefore, had been &s;uffered to retain its
&s;tation in the wall of the chamber, but his
de&s;cendants excu&s;ed them&s;elves from ob|&s;erving
the penance, to which he had been
enjoined.</P>
<P>This image was &s;o horribly natural, that
it is not &s;urpri&s;ing Emily &s;hould have mi&s;taken
it for the object it re&s;embled, nor,
&s;ince &s;he had heard &s;uch an extraordinary
account, concerning the di&s;appearing of the
late lady of the ca&s;tle, and had &s;uch expe|rience
of the character of Montoni, that,
&s;he &s;hould have believed this to be the mur|dered
body of the lady Laurentini, and that
he had been the contriver of her death.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation, in which &s;he had di&s;co|vered
it, occa&s;ioned her, at fir&s;t, much &s;ur|pri&s;e
and perplexity; but the vigilance, with
<PB N="402" REF="408">
which the doors of the chamber, where it
was depo&s;ited, were afterwards &s;ecured, had
compelled her to believe, that Montoni,
not daring to confide the &s;ecret of her death
to any per&s;on, had &s;uffered her remains to
decay in this ob&s;cure chamber. The cere|mony
of the veil, however, and the circum|&s;tance
of the doors having been left open,
even for a moment, had occa&s;ioned her
much wonder and &s;ome doubts; but the&s;e
were not &s;ufficient to overcome her &s;u&s;picion
of Montoni; and it was the dread of
his terrible vengeance, that had &s;ealed her
lips in &s;ilence, concerning what &s;he had
&s;een in the we&s;t chamber.</P>
<P>Emily, in di&s;covering the Marchione&s;s
de Villeroi to have been the &s;i&s;ter of Mon&s;.
St Aubert, was variou&s;ly affected; but,
amid&s;t. the &s;orrow, which &s;he &s;uffered for
her untimely death, &s;he was relea&s;ed from
an anxious and painful conjecture, occa|&s;ioned
by the ra&s;h a&s;&s;ertion of Signora Lau|rentini,
concerning her birth and the ho|nour
of her parents. Her faith in St. Au|bert's
<PB N="403" REF="409">
principles would &s;carcely allow her to
&s;u&s;pect that he had acted di&s;honourably; and
&s;he felt &s;uch reluctance to believe her&s;elf
the daughter of any other, than her, whom
&s;he had always con&s;idered and loved as a
mother, that &s;he would hardly admit &s;uch
a circum&s;tance to be po&s;&s;ible; yet the
likene&s;s, which it had frequently been af|firmed
&s;he bore to the late Marchione&s;s, the
former behaviour of Doroth&eacute;e the old
hou&s;ekeeper, the a&s;&s;ertion of Laurentini, and
the my&s;terious attachment, which St. Au|bert
had di&s;covered, awakened doubts, as to
his connection with the Marchione&s;s, which
her rea&s;on could neither vanqui&s;h, or con|firm.
From the&s;e, however, &s;he was now
relieved, and all the circum&s;tances of her
father's conduct were fully explained; but
her heart was oppre&s;&s;ed by the melancholy
cata&s;trophe of her amiable relative, and by
the awful le&s;&s;on, which the hi&s;tory of
the nun exhibited, the indulgence of
who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions had been the means of lead|ing
her gradually to the commi&s;&s;ion of a
<PB N="404" REF="410">
crime, from the prophecy of which in her
early years &s;he would have recoiled in hor|ror,
and exclaimed&mdash;that it could not be!&mdash;a
crime, which whole years of repentance
and of the &s;evere&s;t penance had not been
able to obliterate from her conscience.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER the late di&s;coveries, Emily was
di&s;tingui&s;hed at the chateau by the Count
and his family, as a relative of the hou&s;e of
Villeroi, and received, if po&s;&s;ible, more
friendly attention, than had yet been &s;hewn
her.</P>
<P>Count De Villefort's &s;urpri&s;e at the delay of
an an&s;wer to his letter, which had been di|rected
to Valancourt, at E&s;tuviere, was min|gled
with &s;atisfaction for the prudence, which
had &s;aved Emily from a share of the anxiety
he now differed, though, when he &s;aw her &s;till
drooping under the effect of his former error,
<PB N="406" REF="412">
all his re&s;olution was nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train him
from relating the truth, that would afford
her a momentary relief. The approaching
nuptials of the Lady Blanche now divided
his attention with this &s;ubject of his anxiety,
for the inhabitants of the chateau were al|ready
bu&s;ied in preparations for that event,
and the arrival of Mon&s;. St. Foix was daily
expected. In the gaiety, which &s;urrounded
her, Emily vainly tried to participate, her
&s;pirits being depre&s;&s;ed by the late di&s;cove|ries
and by the anxiety concerning the fate
of Valancourt, that had been occa&s;ioned by
the de&s;cription of his manner, when he
had delivered the ring. She &s;eemed to per|ceive
in it the gloomy wildne&s;s of de&s;pair;
and, when me con&s;idered to what that de|&s;pair
might have urged him, her heart &s;unk
with terror and grief. The &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e,
as to his &s;afety, to which &s;he believed her&s;elf
condemned, till &s;he &s;hould return to La
Vall&eacute;e, appeared in&s;upportable, and, in &s;uch
moments, &s;he could not even &s;truggle to
<PB N="407" REF="413">
a&s;&s;ume the compo&s;ure, that had left her
mind, but would often abruptly quit the
company &s;he was with, and endeavour to
&s;ooth her &s;pirits in the deep &s;olitudes of
the woods, that overbrowed the &s;hore.
Here, the faint roar of foaming waves, that
beat below, and the &s;ullen murmur of the
wind among the branches around, were cir|cum&s;tances
in uni&s;on with the temper of
her mind; and &s;he would sit on a cliff, or
on the broken &s;teps of her favourite watch|tower,
ob&s;erving the changing colours of
the evening clouds, and the gloom of twi|light
draw over the &s;ea, till the white tops
of billows, riding towards the &s;hore, could
&s;carcely be di&s;cerned amid&s;t the darkened
waters. The lines, engraved by Valancourt
on this tower, &s;he frequently repeated with
melancholy enthu&s;ia&s;m, and then would en|deavour
to check the recollections and the
grief they occa&s;ioned, and to turn her
thoughts to indifferent &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>One evening, having wandered with her
<PB N="408" REF="414">
lute to this her favourite &s;pot, &s;he entered
the ruined tower, and a&s;cended a winding
&s;tair ca&s;e, that led to a &s;mall chamber,
which was le&s;s decayed than the re&s;t of the
building;, and whence &s;he had often gazed,
with admiration, on the wide pro&s;pect of
&s;ea and land, that extended below. The
&s;un was now &s;etting on that tract of the
Pyren&eacute;es, which divides Languedoc from
Rou&s;illon, and, placing her&s;elf oppo&s;ite to
a &s;mall grated window, which, like the
wood-tops beneath, and the waves lower &s;till,
gleamed with the red glow of the we&s;t, &s;he
touched the chords of her lute in &s;olemn
&s;ymphony, and then accompanied it with
her voice, in one of the &s;imple and affecting
airs, to which, in happier days, Valancourt
had often li&s;tened in rapture, and which
&s;he now adapted to the following lines.</P>

and &s;he &s;ung the mournful &s;ongs of
pa&s;t times, till the remembrances they
awakened were too powerful for her heart,
her tears fell upon the lute, over which &s;he
drooped, and her voice trembled, and was
unable to proceed.</P>
<P>Though the &s;un had now sunk behind
the mountains, and even his reflected light
was fading from their highe&s;t points, Emily
did not leave the watch-tower, but conti|nued
to indulge her melancholy reverie,
till a foot&s;tep, at a little di&s;tance, &s;tartled
her, and, on looking through the grate, &s;he
ob&s;erved a per&s;on walking below, whom,
however, &s;oon perceiving to be Mon&s;. Bon|nac,
&s;he returned to the quiet thoughtfulne&s;s
his &s;tep had interrupted. After &s;ome time,
&s;he again &s;truck her lute, and &s;ung her fa|vourite
air; but again a &s;tep di&s;turbed her,
<PB N="412" REF="418">
and, as &s;he pau&s;ed to li&s;ten, &s;he heard it
a&s;cending the &s;tair-ca&s;e of the tower. The
gloom of the hour, perhaps, made her &s;en&s;ible
to &s;ome degree of fear, which &s;he
might not otherwife have felt; for, only a
few minutes before, &s;he had &s;een. Mon&s;.
Bonnac pa&s;s. The &s;teps were quick and
bounding, and, in the next moment, the
door of the chamber opened, and a per|&s;on
entered, who&s;e features were veiled in
the ob&s;curity of twilight; but his voice
could not be concealed, for it was the voice
of Valancourt! At the sound, never heard
by Emily, without emotion, &s;he &s;tarted,
in terror, a&s;toni&s;hment and doubtful plea|&s;ure,
and had &s;carcely beheld him at, her
feet, when &s;he &s;unk into a &s;eat, overcome
by the various emotions, that contended at
her heart, and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to that voice,
who&s;e earne&s;t and trembling calls &s;eemed
as if endeavouring to &s;ave her. Valancourt,
as he hung over Emily, deplored his own
ra&s;h impatience, in having thus &s;urpri&s;ed
her: for when he had arrived at the chateau,
<PB N="413" REF="419">
too anxious to await the return of the
Count, who, he under&s;tood, was in the
grounds, he went him&s;elf to &s;eek him, when,
as he pa&s;&s;ed the tower, he was &s;truck by
the &s;ound of Emily's voice, and immedi|ately
a&s;cended.</P>
<P>It was a con&s;iderable time before &s;he re|vived,
but, when her recollection returned,
&s;he repul&s;ed his attentions, with an air of
re&s;erve, and enquired, with as much di&s;|plea&s;ure
as it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he could feel in
the&s;e fir&s;t moments of his appearance, the
occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"Ah Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt, "that
air, tho&s;e words&mdash;alas! I have, then, little
to hope&mdash;when you cea&s;ed to e&s;teem me,
you cea&s;ed al&s;o to love me!"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true, &s;ir," replied Emily, endea|vouring
to command her trembling voice;
"and if you had valued my e&s;teem, you
would not have given me this new occa|&s;ion
for unea&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>Valancourt's countenance changed &s;ud|denly
from the anxieties of doubt to an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="414" REF="420">
of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;may: he was
&s;ilent a moment, and then &s;aid, "I had
been taught to hope for a very different re|ception!
Is it, then true, Emily, that
I have lost your regard, forever? am I
to believe, that, though your e&s;teem for
me may return&mdash;your affection never can?
Can the Count have meditated the cruelty,
which now tortures me with a &s;econd
death?"</P>
<P>The voice, in which he &s;poke this,
alarmed Emily as much as his words &s;ur|pri&s;ed
her, and, with trembling impatience,
&s;he begged that he would explain them.</P>
<P>"Can any explanation be nece&s;&s;ary?"
&s;aid Valancourt, "do you not know how
cruelly my conduct has been mi&s;repre&s;ented?
that the actions of which you once believed
me guilty (and, O Emily! how could you
&s;o degrade me in your opinion, even for a
moment!) tho&s;e actions&mdash;I hold in as much
contempt and abhorrence as your&s;elf?
Are you, indeed, ignorant, that Count De
Villefort has detected the &s;landers, that have
<PB N="415" REF="421">
robbed me of all I hold dear on earth, and
has invited me hither to ju&s;tify to you my
former conduct? It is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible
you can be uninformed of the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
and I am again torturing my&s;elf
with a fal&s;e hope!</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of Emily confirmed this &s;up|po&s;ition;
for the deep twilight would not
allow Valancourt to di&s;tingui&s;h the a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and doubting joy, that fixed her fea|tures.
For a moment, &s;he continued unable
to &s;peak; then a profound &s;igh deemed to
give &s;ome relief to her &s;pirits, and &s;he
&s;aid,</P>
<P>"Valancourt! I was, till this moment,
ignorant of all the circum&s;tances you have
mentioned; the emotion I now &s;uffer may
a&s;&s;ure you of the truth of this, and, that,
though I had cea&s;ed to e&s;teem, I had not
taught my&s;elf entirely to forget you."</P>
<P>"This moment," &s;aid Valancourt, in a
low voice, and leaning for &s;upport again&s;t
the window&mdash;"this moment brings with
it a conviction that overpowers me!&mdash;I am
<PB N="416" REF="422">
dear to you then&mdash;&s;till dear to you my
Emily!"</P>
<P>"Is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould tell you to:"
&s;he replied, "is it nece&s;&s;ary, that I &s;hould
&s;ay&mdash;the&s;e are the fir&s;t moments of joy
I have known, &s;ince your departure, and
that they repay me for all tho&s;e of pain I
have &s;uffered in the interval?"</P>
<P>"Valancourt &s;ighed deeply and was un|able
to reply but as the pre&s;&s;ed her hand
to his lips the tears that fell over it &s;poke
a language, which could not be mi&s;|taken,
and to which words were inade|quate.</P>
<P>Emily, &s;omewhat tranquillized, pro|po&s;ed
returning to the chateau, and then,
for the fir&s;t time recollected that the Count
had invited Valancourt thither to explain
his conduct, and that no explanation had
yet been given. But, while &s;he acknow|ledged,
this, her heart would not allow her
to dwell, for a moment, on the po&s;&s;ibility of
his unworthine&s;s; his look, his voice, his
manner, all &s;poke the noble &s;incerity, which
<PB N="417" REF="423">
had formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed him; and &s;he
again permitted her&s;elf to indulge the emo|tions
of a joy, more &s;urpri&s;ing and power|ful,
than &s;he had ever before experienced.</P>
<P>Neither Emily or Valancourt were con|&s;cious
how they reached the chateau whi|ther
they might have been transferred by
the &s;pell of a fairy for any thing they could
remember; and it was not till they had
reached the great hall, that either of them
recollected there were other per&s;ons in the
world be&s;ides them&s;elves The count then
came forth with &s;urpri&s;e and with the joy|fulne&s;s
of pure benevolence to welcome
Valancourt and to entreat his forgivenne&s;s
of the inju&s;tice he had done him &s;oon
after which Mon&s;. Bonnac joined this
happy group, in which, he and Valancourt
were mutually rejoiced to meet.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t congratulations were over,
and the general joy became &s;omewhat more
tranquil, the Count withdrew with Valan|court
to the library, where a long conver|&s;ation
palled between them, in which the
<PB N="418" REF="424">
latter &s;o clearly ju&s;tified him&s;elf of the cri|minal
parts of the conduct, imputed to
him, and &s;o candidly confe&s;&s;ed and &s;o feel
ingly lamented the follies, which he had
committed, that the Count was confirmed
in the belief of all he had hoped; and,
while he perceived &s;o many noble virtues
in Valancourt, and that experience had
taught him to dete&s;t the follies, which be|fore
he had only not admired, he did not
&s;cruple to believe, that he would pa&s;s
through life with the dignity of a wi&s;e and
good man, or to entru&s;t to his care the fu|ture
happine&s;s of Emily St. Aubert, for
whom he felt the &s;olicitude of a parent.
Of this he &s;oon informed her, in a &s;hort
conver&s;ation, when Valancourt had left
him. While Emily li&s;tened to a relation
of the &s;ervices, that Valancourt had ren|dered
Mon&s;. Bonnac, her eyes over&s;lowed
with tears of plea&s;ure, and the further con|ver&s;ation
of Count De Villefort perfectly
di&s;&s;ipated every doubt, as to the pa&s;t and fu|ture
conduct of him, to whom the now re|&s;tored,
<PB N="419" REF="425">
without fear, the e&s;teem and affec|tion,
with which &s;he had formerly received
him.</P>
<P>When they returned to the &s;upper-room,
the Counte&s;s and Lady Blanche met Va|lancourt
with &s;incere congratulations; and
Blanche, indeed, was &s;o much rejoiced to
&s;ee Emily returned to happine&s;s, as to for|get,
for a while, that Mon&s;. St. Foix was
not yet arrived at the chateau, though he
had been expected for &s;ome hours; but her
generous &s;ympathy was, &s;oon after, re|warded
by his appearance. He was now
perfectly recovered from the wounds, re|ceived,
during his perilous adventure
among the Pyren&eacute;es, the mention of which
&s;erved to heighten to the parties, who had
been involved in it, the &s;en&s;e of their pre|&s;ent
happine&s;s. New congratulations pa&s;&s;ed
between them, and round the &s;upper-table
appeared a group of faces, &s;miling with
felicity, but with a felicity, which had in
each a different character. The &s;mile of
<PB N="420" REF="426">
Blanche was frank and gay, that of Emily
tender and pen&s;ive; Valancourt's was rap|turous,
tender and gay alternately; Mon&s;.
St. Foix's was joyous, and that of the
Count, as he looked on the &s;urrounding
party, expre&s;&s;ed the tempered complacency
of benevolence; while the features of the
Counte&s;s, Henri, and Mon&s;. Bonnac, di&s;|covered
fainter traces of animation. Poor
Mon&s;. Dupont did not, by his pre&s;ence,
throw a &s;hade of regret over the company;
for when he had di&s;covered, that Valan|court
was not unworthy of the e&s;teem of
Emily, he determined &s;eriou&s;ly to endea|vour
at the conque&s;t of his own hopele&s;s
affection, and had immediately withdrawn
from Chateau-le-Blanc&mdash;a conduct, which
Emily now under&s;tood, and rewarded with
her admiration and pity.</P>
<P>The Count and his gue&s;ts continued to|gether
till a late hour, yielding to the de|lights
of &s;ocial gaiety, and to the &s;weets of
friend&s;hip. When Annette heard of the
<PB N="421" REF="427">
arrival of Valancourt, Ludovico had &s;ome
difficulty to prevent her going into the
&s;upper-room, to expre&s;s her joy, for &s;he
declared, that &s;he had never been &s;o re|joiced
at any <HI>accident</HI> as this, &s;ince &s;he had
found Ludovico him&s;elf.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE marriages of the Lady Blanche
and Emily St. Aubert were celebrated, on
the &s;ame day, and with the ancient baronial
magnificence, at Chateau-le-Blanc. The
fea&s;ts were held in the great hall of
the ca&s;tle, which, on this occa&s;ion, was
hung with &s;uperb new tape&s;try, repre&s;ent|ing
the exploits of Charlemagne and his
twelve peers; here, were &s;een the Saracens,
with their horrible vi&s;ors, advancing to
battle; and there, were di&s;played the wild
<PB N="423" REF="429">
&s;olemnities of incantation, and the necro|mantic
feats, exhibited by the magician
<HI>Jarl</HI> before the Emperor. The &s;umptuous
banners of the family of Villeroi, which
had long &s;lept in du&s;t, were once more un|furled,
to wave over the gothic points of
painted ca&s;ements; and mu&s;ic echoed, in
many a lingering clo&s;e, through every wind|ing
gallery and colonnade of that va&s;t
edifice.</P>
<P>As Annette looked down from the cor|ridor
upon the hall, who&s;e arches and
windows were illuminated with brilliant
fe&s;toons of lamps, and gazed on the &s;plen|did
dre&s;&s;es of the dancers, the co&s;tly live|ries
of the attendants, the canopies of pur|ple
velvet and gold, and li&s;tened to the gay
&s;trains that floated along the vaulted roof,
&s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf in an en|chanted
palace, and declared, that &s;he had
not met with any place, which charmed
her &s;o much, &s;ince &s;he read the fairy tales;
nay, that the fairies them&s;elves, at their
<PB N="424" REF="430">
nightly revels in this old hall, could di&s;play
nothing finer; while old Doroth&eacute;e, as &s;he
&s;urveyed the &s;cene, &s;ighed, and &s;aid, the
ca&s;tle looked as it was wont to do in the
time of her youth.</P>
<P>After gracing the fe&s;tivities of Chateau|le-Blanc,
for &s;ome days, Valancourt and
Emily took leave of their kind friends, and
returned to La Vall&eacute;e, where the faithful
There&s;a received them with un&s;eigned joy,
and the plea&s;ant &s;hades welcomed them
with a thou&s;and tender and affecting re|membrances;
and, while they wandered
together over the &s;cenes, &s;o long inhabited
by the late Mon&s;. and Madame St. Aubert,
and Emily pointed out, with pen&s;ive af|fection,
their favourite haunts, her pre&s;ent
happine&s;s was heightened, by con&s;ider|ing,
that it would have been worthy of
their approbation, could they have wit|ne&s;&s;ed
it.</P>
<P>Valancourt led her to the plane tree on
the terrace, where he had fir&s;t ventured
<PB N="425" REF="431">
to declare his love, and where now the re|membrance
of the anxiety he had then &s;uf|fered,
and the retro&s;pect of all the dangers
and misfortunes they had each encountered,
&s;ince la&s;t they &s;at together beneath its
broad branches, exalted the &s;en&s;e of their
pre&s;ent felicity, which, on this &s;pot, &s;acred
to the memory of St. Aubert, they &s;olemnly
vowed to de&s;erve, as far as po&s;&s;ible, by
endeavouring to imitate his benevolence,&mdash;by
remembering, that &s;uperior attainments
of every fort bring with them duties of
&s;uperior exertion,&mdash;and by affording to their
fellow-beings, together with that portion of
ordinary comforts, which pro&s;perity always
owes to misfortune, the example of lives
pa&s;&s;ed in happy thankfulne&s;s to GOD, and,
therefore, in careful tenderne&s;s to his crea|tures.</P>
<P>Soon after their return to La Vall&eacute;e,
the brother of Valancourt came to congra|tulate
him on his marriage, and to pay his
re&s;pects to Emily, with whom he was &s;o
much plea&s;ed, as well as with the pro&s;pect
<PB N="426" REF="432">
of rational happine&s;s, which the&s;e nuptials
offered to Valancourt, that he immediately
re&s;igned to him a part of the rich domain,
the whole of which, as he had no family,
would of cour&s;e de&s;cend to his brother, on
his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates, at Tholou&s;e, were di&s;po&s;ed
of, and Emily purcha&s;ed of Mon&s;. Que&s;|nel
the ancient domain of her late father,
where, having given Annette a marriage|portion,
&s;he &s;ettled her as the hou&s;ekeeper,
and Ludovico as the &s;teward; but, &s;ince
both Valancourt and her&s;elf preferred the
plea&s;ant and long-loved &s;hades of La Vall&eacute;e
to the magnificence of Epourville, they
continued to re&s;ide there, pa&s;&s;ing, however,
a few months in the year at the birth-place
of St. Aubert, in tender re&s;pect to his me|mory.</P>
<P>The legacy, which had been bequeathed
to Emily by Signora Laurentini, &s;he beg|ged
Valancourt would allow her to re&s;igh
to Mon&s;. Bonnac; and Valancourt, when
<PB N="427" REF="433">
&s;he made the reque&s;t, felt all the value of
the compliment it conveyed. The ca&s;tle
of Udolpho, al&s;o, de&s;cended to the wife of
Mon&s;. Bonnac, who was the neare&s;t &s;urviv|ing
relation of the hou&s;e of that name, and
thus affluence re&s;tored his long-oppre&s;&s;ed
&s;pirits to peace, and his family to com|fort.</P>
<P>O! how joyful it is to tell of happine&s;s,
&s;uch as that of Valancourt and Emily; to
relate, that, after &s;uffering under the op|pre&s;&s;ion
of the vicious and the di&s;dain of
the weak, they were, at length, re&s;tored to
each other&mdash;to the beloved land&s;capes of
their native country,&mdash;to the &s;ecure&s;t feli|city
of this life, that of a&s;piring to moral
and labouring for intellectual improve|ment&mdash;to
the plea&s;ures of enlightened
&s;ociety, and to the exerci&s;e of the benevo|lence,
which had always animated their
hearts; while the bowers of La Vall&eacute;e be|came,
once more, the retreat of goodne&s;s,
wi&s;dom and dome&s;tic ble&s;&s;edne&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="434">
O! u&s;eful-may it be to have &s;hewn,
that, though the vicious can &s;ometimes
pour affliction upon the good, their power
is tran&s;ient and their puni&s;hment certain;
and that innocence, though oppre&s;&s;ed by
inju&s;tice, &s;hall, &s;upported by patience,
finally triumph over misfortune!</P>
<P>And, if the weak hand, that has re|corded,
this tale, has, by its &s;cenes, be|guiled
the mourner of one hour of &s;orrow,
or, by its moral, taught him to &s;u&s;tain it&mdash;the
effort, however humble, has not
been vain, nor is the writer unrewarded.</P>
