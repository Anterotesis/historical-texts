<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_A VERY &s;hort Preface may &s;uf|fice to a Work of this Nature. <HI>Spectre</HI> and <HI>Apparition</HI> make a great Noi&s;e in the World; and have (at lea&s;t formerly) had a great In|fluence among us.</P>
<P>Between our Ance&s;tors laying too much &s;tre&s;s upon them, and the pre&s;ent Age endeavouring wholly to explode and de|&s;pi&s;e them, the World &s;eems hardly ever to have come at a right Under&s;tanding a|bout them.</P>
<P>Some de&s;pi&s;e them in &s;uch an extraor|dinary manner, that they pretend to wi&s;h for nothing more than to be convinc'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">n&s;tration; as if nothing but &s;eeing
<PB REF="4">
the <HI>Devil</HI> could &s;atisfie them there wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch a Per&s;on; and nothing is more won|derful to me, in the whole Sy&s;tem of <HI>Spi|rits,</HI> than that Satan does not think fit to ju&s;tify the Reality of his Being, by ap|pearing to &s;uch in &s;ome of his wor&s;t Fi|gures, and tell them in full Grimace who he is, when I doubt not but they would be as full of the <HI>Pannick</HI> as other People.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome People are &s;o horribly frighted at the very mention of an Appa|rition, that they cannot go two Steps in the dark, or in the dusk of the Evening, without looking behind them; and if they &s;ee but a Bat fly, they think of the <HI>Devil,</HI> becau&s;e of its Wings; and as for a Screech Owl, at its fir&s;t appearance, they make no &s;cruple of running into the Hou&s;e in a Fright, and affirming they have &s;een the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>How to bring the World to a right Temper between the&s;e Extreams is a Dif|ficulty we cannot an&s;wer for; but if &s;et|ting things in a true light, between Imagi|nation and &s;olid Foundation, will a&s;&s;i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> towards it, we hope this Work may hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
Not that I expect to fortify my Rea|ders, and e&s;tabli&s;h their Minds again&s;t the Fears of what they may &s;ee, &s;o that they &s;hall make an Apparition of the <HI>Devil</HI> familiar to them; there is &s;uch a kind of Aver&s;ion in the Minds of Men to the <HI>Angel of Light,</HI> that no body cares to &s;ee him in Imagination, much le&s;s to be forc'd to &s;ee him whe|ther they will or no.</P>
<P>But now on the other hand, if it is true that the <HI>Devil</HI> very rarely does appear, that almo&s;t all real Ap|paritions are of friendly and a&s;&s;i&s;ting Angels, and come of a kind and bene|ficent Errand to us, and that therefore we need not be &s;o terrified at them as we are; if it be true that when any evil Spirit does appear, it is limited by a Superior Power, and can do us no harm without &s;pecial Licence; methinks this &s;hould take off the Terror from our Minds, and cau&s;e us to arm our Souls with Re&s;olution enough to meet the <HI>Devil,</HI> whatever Shape he thinks fit to ap|pear in: For I mu&s;t tell you, <HI>Good People,</HI>
<PB REF="6">
as was &s;aid in another Ca&s;e, he that is not able to &s;ee the <HI>Devil</HI> in whatever Shape he is pleas'd to appear in, is not really qualified to live in this World, no not in the quality of a common Inhabitant.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;take lies chiefly here, that we either will allow no Apparition at all, or will have every Apparition be the <HI>Devil;</HI> as if none of the Inhabitants of the World above, were able to &s;how them&s;elves here, or had any Bu&s;ine&s;s a|mong us, but the <HI>Devil,</HI> who I am of the Opinion has really le&s;s Bu&s;ine&s;s here than any of them all; nay, we have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe he has indeed no Bu&s;ine&s;s here at all, but that of a <HI>roaring Lyon,</HI> &amp;c. and therefore if you meet him, and had Courage for it, the propere&s;t Que&s;tion you could ask him would be, not, <HI>In the Name of GOD, what art thou?</HI> but, <HI>In the Name of GOD, what</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>ha&s;t thou here?</HI> Bid him be gone to his Den, and tell him you will pray to God to chain him up el&s;e: I dare &s;ay he would turn Tayl at &s;uch an Attack &s;eriou&s;ly made; and it would be the be&s;t way in the World to get rid of him.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
That we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay then be perfectly ea&s;y about this undetermin'd thing call'd Ap|parition, I have endeavour'd here to bring the thing into a narrow Compa&s;s, and to &s;ee it in a true light. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ave fir&s;t given you &s;everal Specimens of real Appariti|ons well atte&s;ted, and the truth of them &s;o affirm'd, that they may be depended upon: If in any of them I am not &s;o well a&s;&s;ur'd of the Fact, tho' they may be as certain, yet I have frankly told you &s;o, and adher'd to the Moral only: But all together may convince the Reader of the Rea&s;on and Reality of the thing it &s;elf.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I have given you Specimens of tho&s;e Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ements and De|lu&s;ions which have been put upon the World for Apparitions; and you may &s;ee the dif|ference is &s;o Notorious, (whether the Cheat be Political or Whim&s;ical, Magical or I|maginary,) that no Man can be ea&s;ily de|ceiv'd, that will but make u&s;e of the Eyes of his Under&s;tanding, as well as of tho&s;e in his Head.</P>
<P>If, after all, you will give up your Rea|&s;on to your Fancy, which at be&s;t is but
<PB REF="8">
a Di&s;temper, and that you will call every Shadow an Apparition, and every Ap|parition a <HI>Devil,</HI> you mu&s;t be content to be the Subject of con&s;tant Delu&s;ion; for he that will imagine he &s;ees the <HI>Devil</HI> always about him, whether Satan is really near him or no, &s;hall never want walk|ing Shado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s to amu&s;e him, 'till he really calls up t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Devil</HI> he fears, and be&s;peaks the Mi&s;chief he was before in Danger of.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. Of Apparitions in General: the Certainty and Nature of them.</HEAD>
<P>_OF all the <HI>Arcana</HI> of the invi&s;ible World, I know no One Thing about which more has been &s;aid, and le&s;s under&s;tood, than this of Apparition: It is divided &s;o much between the Appearance of good and the Apparition of bad Spirits, that our Thoughts are &s;trangely confus'd about it.</P>
<P>FIRST, We make a great deal of Difficulty to re|&s;olve whether there are any &s;uch things as Appa|ritions or no; and &s;ome People are for reducing them all into Fancy, Whim&s;ie, and the Vapours; and &s;o &s;hutting the Door again&s;t Apparitions in general,
<PB N="2" REF="13">
they re&s;olve to receive no Vi&s;its from the invi&s;ible World, nor to have any Acquaintance with its Inhabitants 'till they come there; Not &s;atisfy'd with that, they re&s;olve for us all, as well as for them&s;elves, and will have it, that becau&s;e they have no Notion of it them&s;elves, therefore there is really no &s;uch thing, and this they have advanc'd with great A&s;&s;urance, as well in Print as in other Di&s;cour&s;es. I name no body.</P>
<P>I HAVE, I believe, as true a Notion of the Power of Imagination as I ought to have, and you &s;hall hear farther from me upon that Head; I believe we form as many Apparitions in our Fancies, as we &s;ee really with our Eyes, and a great many more; nay, our Imaginations &s;ometimes are very diligent to embark the Eyes (and the Ears too) in the Delu&s;ion, and per&s;uade us to believe we &s;ee Spectres and Ap|pearances, and hear Noi&s;es and Voices, when in|deed, neither the <HI>Devil</HI> or any other Spirit, good or bad, has troubled them&s;elves about us.</P>
<P>BUT it does not follow from thence that there|fore there are no &s;uch Things in Nature; that there is no Intercour&s;e or Communication between the World of Spirits, and the World we live in; that the Inhabitants of the invi&s;iblc Spaces, <HI>be tho&s;e where you plea&s;e,</HI> have no Conver&s;e with us, and that they never take the Liberty to &s;top down upon this Globe, or to vi&s;it their Friends here; and in &s;hort, that they have nothing to do with or &s;ay to us, or we with or to them. The Enquiry is not, as I take it, whether they do really come hither or no, but who they are that do come?</P>
<P>SPIRIT is certainly &s;omething that we do not fully under&s;tand, in our pre&s;ent confined Circum|&s;tances; and as we do not fully under&s;tand the thing, &s;o neither can we di&s;tingui&s;h of its Operations. As we at pre&s;ent conceive of it, 'tis an unre&s;train<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, unlimited Being; except by &s;uch Laws of the invi&s;ible
<PB N="3" REF="14">
State, which at pre&s;ent we know little of; its way of conver&s;ing we know nothing of, other than this, that we bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eve, and indeed &s;ee Rea&s;on for it, that it can act in an invi&s;ible and imperceptible man|ner; it moves without being pre&s;crib'd or limited by Space, it can come and not be &s;een, go and not be perceiv'd; 'tis not to be &s;hut in by Doors, or &s;hut out by Bolts and Bars; in a Word, it is un|confined by all tho&s;e Methods which we confine our Actions by, or by which we under&s;tand our|&s;elves to be limited and pre&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>YET notwith&s;tanding all this, it conver&s;es here, is with us, and among us; corre&s;ponds, tho' un|embodied, with our Spirits which are embodied; and this conver&s;ing is by not only an invi&s;ible, but to us an inconceivable way; it is neither tied down to Speech or to Vi&s;ion, but moving in a &s;uperior Orb, conveys its Meaning to our Under&s;tandings, its Mea&s;ures to our Conceptions; deals with the Imagination, and works it up to receive &s;uch Im|pre&s;&s;ions as &s;erve for its purpo&s;e; and yet at the &s;ame time we are perfectly pa&s;&s;ive, and have no A|gency in, or Knowledge of the Matter.</P>
<P>BY this &s;ilent Conver&s;e, all the kind Notices of approaching Evil or Good are convey'd to us, which are &s;ometimes &s;o evident, and come with &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible Force upon the Mind, that we mu&s;t be more than &s;tupid if we do not perceive them; and if we are not extremely wanting to our &s;elves, we may take &s;uch due Warning by them, as to avoid the Evils which we had No|tice of in that manner, and to embrace the Good that is offer'd to us: Nor are there many People alive who can deny but they have had &s;uch Notices, by which, if they had given due Atten|tion to them, they had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ave them|&s;elves from the Mi&s;chiefs which followed; or had, on the other hand, taken hold of &s;uch and &s;uch
<PB N="4" REF="15">
Advantages as had been offer'd for their Good: for it is certainly one of the grand and mo&s;t impor|tant Difficulties of human Life, to know whether &s;uch or &s;uch things, which pre&s;ent in our ordinary or extraordinary Circum&s;tances, are for our good, as they &s;eem to be, and as may be pretended, or not, and whether it is proper for us to accept them or no; and many unhappily &s;tand in the Way of their own Pro&s;perity, for want of knowing what to ac|cept of, and what to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>NOW by what Agency mu&s;t it be that we have Directions, for good or foreboding Thoughts of Mi&s;|chiefs which attend us, and which it is otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould know any thing of; if &s;ome intelligent Being, who can &s;ee into Futurity, had not convey'd the Apprehen&s;ions into the Mind, and had not cau&s;ed the Emotion which alarms the Soul?</P>
<P>AND how &s;hould that intelligent Being (what|ever it is) convey the&s;e Forebodings and &s;udden Mi&s;givings, as we rightly call them, into the Mind, if there was not a certain Corre&s;pondence between them, a way of talking perfectly unintelligible to us, uncommon, and without the Help of Sounds or any other perceptible Way?</P>
<Q><L>For Spirits without the Helps of Voice conver&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>AS thus there is a Conver&s;e of Spirits, an Intel|ligence, or call it what you plea&s;e, between our Spirits embodied and ca&s;ed up in Fle&s;h, and the Spirits unembodied; who inhabit the unknown Mazes of the invi&s;ible World, tho&s;e Coa&s;ts which our Geography cannot de&s;cribe; who, between <HI>Some|where</HI> and <HI>No-where</HI> dwell, none of us know <HI>where,</HI> and yet we are &s;ure mu&s;t have Locality, and for ought we know, are very near us; why &s;hould it be thought &s;o &s;trange a thing, that tho&s;e Spirits
<PB N="5" REF="16">
&s;hould be able to take upon them an Out-&s;ide or Ca&s;e? why &s;hould they not be able, on Occa&s;ion, or when they think fit, to dre&s;s them&s;elves up as we do <HI>a la Ma&s;querade,</HI> in a Habit di&s;guis'd like Fle&s;h and Blood, to deceive human Sight, &s;o as to make them&s;elves vi&s;ible to us? As they are free Spirits, why may they not be like what my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> expre&s;&s;es in another Ca&s;e,</P>
<Q><L>A Spirit free to chu&s;e for their own Share</L>
<L>What Ca&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood they plea&s;e to wear?</L></Q>
<BIBL><HI>Roch.</HI> Sat. again&s;t Man.</BIBL>
<P>I do not by this affirm that it is &s;o, and that a Spirit may thus a&s;&s;ume a real Ca&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood; for I re&s;olve to affirm nothing that will not bear a Proof, and to &s;ugge&s;t nothing without Pro|bability, in all this Work.</P>
<P>BUT it is enough to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e if the&s;e invi&s;ible Inhabitants can a&s;&s;ume an Appearance, a Form &s;ufficient to make them perceptible to us; at the &s;ame time not being at all ve&s;ted with any Sub&s;tance, much le&s;s of the Species which they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IF they can a&s;&s;ume a vi&s;ible Form, as I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to &s;ay they cannot, there is no room then to doubt of the Reality of their appearing; becau&s;e what <HI>may be</HI> we cannot but believe &s;ometimes <HI>has been,</HI> as what <HI>has been,</HI> we are &s;ure <HI>may be.</HI></P>
<P>TO &s;ay that the unembodied Spirits can have no|thing to do with us, and that we have Rea&s;on to believe they are not at all acquainted with human Affairs, is to &s;ay what no Man can be a&s;&s;ured of, and therefore is begging the Que&s;tion in the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t manner.</P>
<P>I SHALL therefore &s;pend but very little time to prove or to argue for the Reality of Apparition. Let Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> and his Antagoni&s;ts, the <HI>Hobbi&s;ts</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="17">
and <HI>Sadduces</HI> of tho&s;e Times, be your Di&s;putants upon that Subject; nor &s;hall I trouble you with much Antiquity or Hi&s;tory: a little that is mo&s;t unexceptionable may be nece&s;&s;ary. If there is an invi&s;ible World, and if Spirits re&s;iding or inhabit|ing are allowed to be there, or placed there by the &s;upreme governing Power of the Univer&s;e; it will be hard to prove, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould come hither, or that they &s;hould not have Liberty to &s;how them&s;elves here, and conver&s;e in this Globe, as well as in all the other Globes or Worlds, which, for ought we know, are to be found in that immen&s;e Space; Rea&s;on does not exclude them, Nature yields to the Po&s;&s;ibility, and Experience with a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es in all Ages confirm the Reality of the affirmative.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion therefore before me is not &s;o much whether there are any &s;uch things as Appari|tions of Spirits; but WHO, and WHAT, and from WHENCE they are; what Bu&s;ine&s;s they come about, who &s;ends them or directs them, and how and in what manner we ought to think and act, and behave about them, and to them; and this is the Sub&s;tance of this Undertaking.</P>
<P>THE Angels are &s;aid to be <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits,</HI> and we know they have been made u&s;e of (as &s;uch) on many Occa&s;ions, by the &s;uperior Appointment of him that created them; why then it may not be thought fit by the &s;ame Power, to make or &s;ub&s;ti|tute a Mini&s;tration of the&s;e unembodied Spirits to the Service of the embodied Souls of Men, which are al&s;o God's Creatures, we cannot tell.</P>
<P>UPON what foot, and to what end, either on their Side or on ours, and from what Appointment, is very difficult to a&s;certain; and yet &s;ome probable Gue&s;&s;es might be made at it too, if it was the proper Work before me; but I am rather adju&s;ting the Fact, and a&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rtaining the Reality of Apparitions in
<PB N="7" REF="18">
general, than inquiring into the Rea&s;ons of them; either the Rea&s;ons in Nature, or in Providence, which are perhaps farther out of our Reach than &s;ome People imagine.</P>
<P>IT is as difficult too to determine whether the Spirits that appear are good or evil, or both; the only Conclu&s;ion upon that Point is to be made from the Errand they come about; and it is a very ju&s;t Conclu&s;ion, I think; for if a Spirit or Apparition comes to or haunts us only to terrify and affright, to fill the Mind with Horror, and the Hou&s;e with Di&s;order, we cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that to be a good Spirit; and on the other hand, if it comes to direct to any Good, or to forewarn and pre&s;erve from any approaching Evil, it cannot then be rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e 'tis an evil Spirit.</P>
<P>THE Story of an Apparition di&s;turbing a young Gentleman, at or near <HI>Cambridge,</HI> is remarkable to this Purpo&s;e: He &s;et up, it &s;eems, for a kind of profe&s;s'd Athei&s;m; but hearing a Voice, &s;uppo&s;ed it was the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;poke to him, and yet owned that the Voice a&s;&s;ured him <HI>there was a God,</HI> and <HI>bid him repent.</HI> It was a mo&s;t incongruous Sugge&s;tion that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould come Voluntier to an Athei&s;t, and bid him repent; or, that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould with a like Freedom a&s;&s;ert the Being of a GOD.</P>
<P>IF then it was a real Apparition of, or a Voice from an invi&s;ible Spirit; (I &s;ay <HI>if,</HI> becau&s;e it might be a Phantom of his own Imagination) it mu&s;t be from a good Spirit, or from an evil Spirit over-rul'd by a &s;uperior and beneficent Power; and if that were to be &s;uppo&s;ed, then it would ju&s;tify our taking far|ther Notice of tho&s;e things called Voices and Apparitions, than I &s;hall venture to advi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Apparitions in particular, the Reality of them, their Antiquity, and the Diffe|rence between the Apparitions of former Times, and tho&s;e which we may call Modern; with &s;omething of the Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ion of that Difference.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be a &s;tronger Te&s;timony of the Reality of Apparitions in General, than to de&s;cend to the particular Appearances which we are a&s;&s;ur'd have been &s;een and convers'd with from the &s;uperior World. And fir&s;t I begin with &s;uch as have been evidently from Heaven it &s;elf, and by the &s;overaign Appointment of Providence upon extraor|dinary Occa&s;ions. And tho' I &s;hall trouble my Rea|ders with as little as po&s;&s;ible out of Scripture, e&s;|pecially at the Beginning of my Work, becau&s;e I am unwilling they &s;hould throw it by, before they read it out, which there would be &s;ome Danger of, if I &s;hould begin too grave!</P>
<P>YET, as I cannot go back to Originals, or be|gin at the Beginning, without a little Hi&s;tory out of tho&s;e ancient Times, you mu&s;t bear with my ju&s;t naming the Sacred Hi&s;torians. I'll be as &s;hort as I can.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, if the Scripture is at all to be believed among us, than that GOD him|&s;elf was plea&s;ed, in the Infancy of Things, to ap|pear Vi&s;ibly, and in Form, to &s;everal Per&s;ons, and
<PB N="9" REF="20">
on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, upon Earth; a&s;&s;uming or taking up the Shape of his Creature Man, when he thought fit to conver&s;e with him, that he might not be a Terror to him.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Adam</HI> was frequently vi&s;ited in <HI>Eden,</HI> and we have no room to doubt but it was in a vi&s;ible Form, becau&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> both heard him &s;peak, and as the Text &s;ays, <HI>They heard the Voice of the</HI> Lord God <HI>walking in the Garden in the Cool of the Day.</HI> Gen. iii. 8.</P>
<P>BY all the Hi&s;tory of the Antediluvean World, we have rea&s;on to believe, that as God did fre|quently &s;peak to Men, &s;o he as frequently appear'd to them; for we find they conver&s;ed with God Face to Face. <HI>Cain,</HI> tho' wicked, talk'd with GOD, and GOD with him, when he was charg'd with the Mur|ther of his Brother <HI>Abel;</HI> and the Text is expre&s;s, <HI>Gen.</HI> iv. 16. that after it, <HI>Cain went out from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI> So that God not only &s;poke to him by a voice, but was Vi&s;ible and Pre&s;ent to him.</P>
<P>AND as I mu&s;t carry the <HI>Devil</HI> along with me, hand in hand, in every Period of Time, &s;o even in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> a&s;&s;um'd a Shape. For we mu&s;t allow Satan to be a Spirit, and indeed, we have good rea&s;on to &s;ay he is <HI>a Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, free</HI> to CHUSE what <HI>Ca&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood</HI> he plea&s;es to put on, or at lea&s;t &s;eemingly to put on.</P>
<P>THUS he without doubt &s;poke in the Mouth of the Serpent in the Garden, or el&s;e took upon him|&s;elf that Shape, tho' the former is the mo&s;t proba|ble; becau&s;e the Serpent was cur&s;t for being but the In&s;trument, however pa&s;&s;ive he might be.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>MILTON</HI> makes no doubt of the Devil's a&s;&s;uming a Shape of any kind, <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> as well as <HI>Man,</HI> when he brings him in whi&s;pering to <HI>Eve</HI> in her Sleep, and placing him&s;elf clo&s;e at her Ear, in the Shape of a Toad, which he expre&s;&s;es in his Sublime
<PB N="10" REF="21">
Poem, and with that inimitable Manner, pe|culiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>FIRST he brings Satan leaping over the Mound or Fence, which God had placed round the Gar|den, as a Wolf leaps over the Hurdles into a Sheep-fold; and being gotten into Paradi&s;e, he places him&s;elf upon the Tree of Life, in the Shape of a <HI>Raven</HI> or Cormorant. There's the <HI>Devil</HI>'s fir&s;t Apparition.</P>
<P>THENCE he views the whole Garden, and all the Creatures in it, and at la&s;t he &s;pies <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> to his great Surpri&s;e. But after a while &s;pent in admiring their Form, their Beauty, Felicity and Innocence, as he re&s;olv'd to ruin them, &s;o he comes down from the Tree to be nearer them; and mixing among the Cattle, where he takes upon him now one Shape, then another, as it be&s;t &s;uited him, to be near <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and yet to be unperceived by them; this the Poet de&s;cribes thus;</P>
<LG>
<L>Then from his lofty Stand on that high Tree,</L>
<L>Down he alights among the &s;portful Herd</L>
<L>Of tho&s;e four-footed Kinds; <HI>him&s;elf now one,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Now other,</HI> as their <HI>Shape</HI> be&s;t &s;erv'd his End</L>
<L>Nearer to view his Prey, and une&s;py'd</L>
<L>To mark what of their State he more might learn.</L>
<L>&mdash;About them round,</L>
<L><HI>A Lion now</HI> he &s;talks with fiery Glare;</L>
<L>Then <HI>as a</HI> Tiger,&mdash;</L>
<L><BIBL>Milt. Parad. lib. IV. ver. 395.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>Again, when he makes the Angels find Satan, as I have ob&s;erved, whi&s;pering evil Thoughts to <HI>Eve</HI> in a Dream, and in her Sleep, he &s;ays,</P>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="22">
<L>&mdash;Him there they found,</L>
<L>Squat <HI>like a Toad,</HI> clo&s;e at the Ear of <HI>Eve;</HI></L>
<L>A&s;&s;aying, by his devili&s;h Art, to reach</L>
<L>The Organs of her Fancy, and with them forge</L>
<L>Illu&s;ions, as he li&s;t, Phanta&s;ms, and Dreams.</L>
<L><BIBL>Ib. ver. 799.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>'TIS evident then, that the <HI>Devil</HI> can a&s;&s;ume a Shape, whether of Man or Bea&s;t, and appear as &s;uch, in order to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf from our Sight. We &s;hall have a farther Account of him pre&s;ently, but in the mean time let us &s;ee higher, and go into the After-Ages.</P>
<P><HI>ABRAHAM</HI> is the fir&s;t Example, after <HI>Noah,</HI> of an open Conver&s;e with his Maker; and the Scripture di&s;tingui&s;hes the very manner; &s;ometimes 'tis &s;aid, that the Lord <HI>had &s;aid to Abram,</HI> Gen. xii. 1. and again, the <HI>Lord &s;aid to Abram,</HI> Gen. xiii. 14. again <HI>The Word of the Lord came to Abram,</HI> and <HI>the Word of the Lord came to Abram in a Vi&s;ion.</HI> Gen. xv. 1. 4, to the 7th.</P>
<P>BUT there are other expre&s;s Places in which it is &s;aid in plain Words, God appeared to him. Gen. xii. 7. <HI>The Lord appear'd unto Abram:</HI> and Gen. xvii. 1. <HI>The Lord appeared to Abram, and &s;aid unto him:</HI> and ver. 22. <HI>And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</HI> 'Tis undeniable that God appeared, and was with him, and left off talking with him, and went from him: all Marks of a vi&s;i|ble Apparition.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Chap. xviii. here it is &s;till more ex|plicit, and God not only appeared, but appeared in a Human Shape. Ver. 1. <HI>And the Lord appeared to him in the Plains of Mamre, as he &s;at in the Door of his Tent.</HI> Fir&s;t 'tis &s;aid, he lift up his Eyes and looked, and behold, three Men &s;tood by him. So vi&s;ible were they, that he entertains them,
<PB N="12" REF="23">
invites them to Dinner, and prepares a fat Calf to be dre&s;s'd, and Cakes, and Butter, and Milk. In &s;hort, he made a Fea&s;t; &s;o much was he, as it may be &s;aid, deluded; &s;o real was the Appearance; nay, when he &s;at it all before them, 'tis &s;aid thy DID EAT.</P>
<P>NOW, ver. 13. 'tis &s;aid expre&s;ly one of the&s;e was the LORD; nay, in the Original it is JEHOVAH; that was when he charg'd <HI>Sarah</HI> with laughing, and &s;he deny'd it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B. Sarah</HI> was the fir&s;t of Human Kind, that ever told GOD a LYE to his Face. But &s;he was frighted, that's certain; the Text &s;ays &s;o.</P>
<P>IN the 17th Ver&s;e, when God tells <HI>Abraham</HI> what he had re&s;olv'd to do to <HI>Sodom;</HI> 'tis plain, he &s;peaks in the fir&s;t Per&s;on as God; <HI>And the Lord &s;aid, &s;hall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do?</HI> Hereupon <HI>Abraham</HI> takes upon him to plead with God in be|half of <HI>Sodom;</HI> and in this he &s;peaks as to God him|&s;elf, ver. 30. <HI>O let not the Lord be angry, and I will &s;peak:</HI> and before that, ver. 27. <HI>Behold now I have taken upon me to &s;peak unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>which am but Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I think 'tis evident, that God him&s;elf did appear in Humane Shape to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and that more than once. The next Chapter is as plain, that he did the &s;ame to LOT; or if it &s;hould be obje|cted that it is not &s;o clear that it was God him&s;elf, it was two Angels; tho' Interpreters do generally agree, that it was Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who is called an Angel, the Angel of the Covenant. But if that were doubtful, then it will &s;till be allow'd that it was an Apparition of Angels in Human Shape, which will &s;tand good in my next Article.</P>
<P>BUT as I am upon the Highe&s;t and Supreme In&s;tances fir&s;t, I mu&s;t fini&s;h it by two particular
<PB N="13" REF="24">
Quotations, which cannot be di&s;puted. (1.) One is of <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. xxxii. 24. <HI>There wre&s;tled a man with him:</HI> and ver. 28. the Man is &s;aid to be GOD him|&s;elf, <HI>as a Prince ha&s;t thou Power with</HI> GOD, <HI>and ha&s;t prevail'd:</HI> and ver. 30. after he had ble&s;&s;ed him, <HI>Jacob</HI> call'd the Place <HI>Peniel,</HI> that is <HI>the Face of</HI> GOD. For, &s;ays he, <HI>I have &s;een</HI> GOD <HI>Face to Face.</HI> Again <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;ays, Gen. xlviii. 3. <HI>God Almighty ap|peared to me at Luz in the Land of Canaan, and ble&s;|&s;ed me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) BUT there is yet a &s;tronger Te&s;timony than all this, for it is &s;poken from the Mouth of GOD him&s;elf upon a very particular Occa&s;ion, which was to honour <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h him in the Reve|rence and Regard of the People, when the Se|venty Men or Elders were appointed to take Part of his Work off his Hands, and judge of &s;maller Matters among the People; which is nobly ex|pre&s;s'd, Numb. xi. 17. <HI>They &s;hall bear the Burthen of the People with thee.</HI> In the next Chapter <HI>Miriam,</HI> and even <HI>Aaron</HI> him&s;elf, &s;pake again&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> that is in &s;hort ro&s;e in Rebellion; and God, to honour his Servant, tells them how he had, and would di&s;tin|gui&s;h <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> from all the re&s;t. ver. 8. <HI>With him will I &s;peak Mouth</HI> to <HI>Mouth,</HI> even APPARENTLY, <HI>and not in Dark Speeches,</HI> and <HI>the Similitude of the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall be</HI> BEHOLD.</P>
<P>HERE is a po&s;itive Declaration from Heaven, that GOD would appear vi&s;ibly to <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> the like In&s;tance is not to be &s;een in the whole Bible. The Word <HI>Apparently</HI> is plain, it can be no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, without gro&s;s Equivocating with the Text.</P>
<P>COME we next to the Times of our Ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour, and there we have two eminent Appear|ances within the Compa&s;s of our pre&s;ent Argu|ment.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="25">
1. THE HOLY GHOST appearing in the Shape of a <HI>Dove.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE Appearance of JESUS CHRIST after his Re&s;urrection, when in the glorify'd Body where|with he a&s;cended; and that this was an Apparition, is plain, from the &s;everal Circum&s;tances of his Ap|pearance.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> When he join'd the two Di&s;ciples go|ing to <HI>Emaus:</HI> that he appear'd as a Man, the Text is plain from his walking with them, and Di&s;cour&s;e to them; and that it was but an Apparition is al&s;o plain. Luke xxiv. 16. <HI>Their Eyes were holden that they &s;hould not know him:</HI> and ver. 31. when their Eyes were opened to know him he vani&s;hed out of their Sight.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> When he appear'd to <HI>Mary Mag|dalen</HI> at the Sepulchre, but forbad her to touch him, <HI>John</HI> xx. 17. And again <HI>ver.</HI> 19. when he came into the Room where the Di&s;ciples were a&s;&s;embled, and when the Doors were &s;hut, and &s;aid, <HI>Peace be unto to you.</HI> Thus it is evident Chri&s;t has appear'd, and he has told us he &s;hall appear again, coming in the Clouds of Heaven; and we look for that ble&s;&s;ed Hope, and glorious Appearing.</P>
<P>THUS then you have GOD him&s;elf, <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> appearing in di&s;tinct Times, in &s;e|veral Shapes or Forms of Appearance, all giving Te&s;timony in general to the Reality of this Truth, That Spirits can a&s;&s;ume Humane or other Shapes, and be made vi&s;ible to Mankind; and this is what we call Apparition.</P>
<P>HAVING thus brought an In&s;tance of the mo&s;t exalted Kind, even the Appearance or Apparition of God him&s;elf, 'tis needful to &s;tate a little the Difference between tho&s;e Appearances, and that which we are now to di&s;cour&s;e of.</P>
<P>'TIS an Objection natural to the Ca&s;e in hand, We do not que&s;tion, much le&s;s enquire, whether
<PB N="15" REF="26">
infinite Power, to whom all things are not po&s;&s;ible only, but ea&s;y, can a&s;&s;ume a Humane Shape, or any other; and appear, <HI>when, where, how,</HI> and in <HI>what Form</HI> he thinks fit; and that he has, or may have &s;o appeared. But there is a manife&s;t Difference between what God is able, or may plea&s;e to do up|on extraordinary Occa&s;ions, and what any of his Creatures may or can do.</P>
<P>BESIDES 'tis evident, or at lea&s;t we have rea|&s;on to believe, that God him&s;elf did appear in tho&s;e Times upon tho&s;e extraordinary Occa&s;ions only, and that he has never appear'd &s;ince; except that &s;hould be call'd an Appearance or Apparition which &s;poke to St. <HI>Paul</HI> at his Conver&s;ion, when it is ex|pre&s;ly &s;aid, he &s;aw a Light, and heard a Voice, but &s;aw no Man; tho' afterwards he calls it &s;eeing him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 8. <HI>La&s;t of all he was &s;een of me al&s;o.</HI> Where|as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> we all know, did &s;peak there of &s;eeing Chri&s;t in the Fle&s;h, while he was on Earth. But I &s;ay, except this, we have no Example of any Appearance of the Divine Maje&s;ty in Humane Shape, or in any other manner what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THAT therefore we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h this from the Subject we are now entering upon, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the Appearances of God are extremely different from the Apparitions of Creatures, whether Angels, Devils, or Souls of Men. That the Que&s;tion is not, Whe|ther God can do this or that; but, Whether the Spi|rits, Spirits Inferior, can do it: and, which is yet more to our Purpo&s;e, Suppo&s;e it has been &s;o for|merly, and in ancient times, whether they do con|tinue to do &s;o &s;till, or have power to do it, let the Occa&s;ion be what it will.</P>
<P>THUS the Enquiry is reduc'd to a narrower Compa&s;s. I take upon me the Affirmative; and we are now to look back into Time for the Confirma|tion or Proof of it, and by enquiring what has been, inform our &s;elves of what may be, is, or is to be expected, as occa&s;ion may require.</P>

<P>THUS I lay every thing down with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s, that I may leave the Reader in no Un|certainty about my Meaning in the Subject I am upon, or give room for Cavilings or Di&s;putings at either the Thing it &s;elf, or the manner of Ex|pre&s;&s;ing ti.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Appearance of Angels immediately in Mi&s;&s;ion as from Heaven; and why we are to &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e kinds of Apparitions are at an End.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Angels have appeared to Men, we have abundant Te&s;timony in the Hi&s;tories of Times Pa&s;t, as well Sacred as Prophane; nor &s;hall I &s;pend one Moment of your Time to examine, or confirm it, except as it comes nece&s;&s;arily in by the occa&s;ion of other Di&s;cour&s;e: For it is not the Appearance of Angels as &s;uch, but the Appearance of Angels in the Shape of Men, that is the pre&s;ent Enquiry.</P>
<P>THAT this has been, is evident, and in general the Scripture gives this Te&s;timony to it: when the Apo&s;tle advi&s;es to Ho&s;pitality, and to entertain Strangers, he adds, <HI>For thereby &s;ome have entertain'd</HI> Angels <HI>unawares.</HI> Heb. xiii. 2. This mu&s;t be meant of Angels in Humane Shape, otherwi&s;e the ho&s;pi|table Per&s;on could not be mi&s;taken in &s;uch a manner: Be&s;ides, it plainly refers to <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> xviii. 1. &s;itting in the Door of his Tent, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. three Men &s;tood by him; two of the&s;e were certainly Angels; who the third was, I have &s;hewn already. It may likewi&s;e include <HI>Lot,</HI> in who&s;e Story, <HI>Gen.</HI> xix. it is expre&s;s'd, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. that they were two Angels, and <HI>ver.</HI> 8. <HI>Lot</HI> calls them <HI>the&s;e Men,</HI> and <HI>ver.</HI> 10, 12, 16. they are called <HI>the Men;</HI> &s;o that LOT believ'd them to be Men only, and as &s;uch he not only in|vited them unto his Hou&s;e, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. but he made them a Fea&s;t, and they did eat, <HI>ver.</HI> 3.</P>

THESE Apparitions of Angels, in the Shape of Men, are undeniable on other Occa&s;ions; but when they appear as Angels, it is &s;aid &s;o plainly, and in &s;o many Words; as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he was going to offer his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> Gen. xxii. 11. <HI>The Angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of Hea|ven;</HI> and again ver. 15. <HI>The Angel of the Lord called the &s;econd time.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are innumerable Examples of Angels appearing as Angels; but we are upon the Ap|pearance of Angels as Men, and in the Shape and Habit of Men.

<P>ANOTHER Example is, of the Angel that ap|pear'd to <HI>Manoah</HI> the Father of <HI>Samp&s;on;</HI> his Wife indeed calls him a Man of God, and that he ap|pear'd to her; but &s;ays, that his Countenance was like an Angel of God, very terrible; <HI>Judges</HI> xiii. 6. But &s;till when he appear'd a &s;econd time, it was in the Shape of a Man, or el&s;e why did <HI>Manoah</HI> de|&s;ire him to &s;tay 'till he could dre&s;s a Kid for him? and the Words are expre&s;s, ver. 16. <HI>He knew not that it was an Angel of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are other Examples in Scripture, where the Angels have appeared in Humane Shape, and convers'd with Men upon Earth, be&s;ides &s;uch as have appear'd in their real Angelick Form as An|gels. How and in what they were known to be
<PB N="20" REF="31">
Angels, in what Form they have been &s;een, and in what Voice they &s;poke, is not di&s;cover'd to us in the Scripture. Some are of Opinion, that even tho&s;e Angels appear'd in the Shape of Men, and cloathed as Men; as the Angel that met <HI>Balaam</HI> with a flaming Sword in his Hand; the Angels which <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aw a&s;cending and de&s;cending on the Ladder; the Angels that &s;poke to <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the Temple, to the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> in the Chamber, and that &s;at in the Sepulchre after Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, and asked the Di&s;ciples, <HI>why &s;eek ye the Living among the Dead?</HI> and &s;o in &s;everal Ca&s;es: All that can be an&s;wer'd is, that the Text call'd them Angels, and &s;o far we are not to doubt it; but I mu&s;t al&s;o al|low, that they &s;eem to me to have been in the Figure of Men; as for tho&s;e in the Sepulchre, St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays expre&s;ly, they &s;aw <HI>two Men</HI> in &s;hining Garments, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 4. and in the &s;ame Chapter, ver. 23. 'tis &s;aid, they had &s;een a Vi&s;ion of Angels.</P>
<P>THUS far it relates to good Angels, &s;uch as have been &s;een on Earth in Apparition, but have made &s;uch an Appearance by vertue of the &s;uperior Mi&s;&s;ion, as the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who tells <HI>Zacharias, I am &s;ent to &s;peak unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the&s;e have upon many occa&s;ions been &s;een in Humane Shape is evident; and tho' much more time might be &s;pent upon the Proof, I think 'tis needle&s;s; indeed the Evidence is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>THERE is a Que&s;tion &s;till remaining, relating to this Part, <HI>(viz.)</HI> How comes it to pa&s;s that all this is cea&s;ed, and that the Angels have done coming, or are no more &s;ent of &s;uch Errands? but that all the Angels we have any Account of in the&s;e Days, are of a wor&s;e kind, and generally come upon wor&s;e Errands? and which particular Ob&s;er|vation is the very rea&s;on of our Doubts, whether the Appearance of the other is real or not.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="32">
THIS Que&s;tion might be an&s;wer'd many Ways, but 'tis too grave for the Times; and as we are not writing Divinity, I &s;hall not load you with &s;erious Points: The &s;hort Account of it is this: <HI>We have</HI> now <HI>a more &s;ure Word of Prophecy:</HI> (that is) that &s;ince the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, and the Revelation of God by a written Word, there is no more need of what the Text calls <HI>a mini&s;tra|tion of Angels.</HI> The Scripture is a daily Revelation, and the Spirit of God, who is promi&s;ed to lead us, is a daily In&s;piration, there is no more need of Vi&s;ion and Apparition; and this is that glorious Dif|ference between the Revelations of tho&s;e Days, and the&s;e of ours, and the rea&s;on of the Difference between the Apparitions of the&s;e Times and of tho&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN I am &s;peaking things &s;erious, I am to &s;peak very &s;hort, that I may not &s;hock your rea|ding; the Ta&s;te of the Times happening at this Jun|cture to lye another way: but my next Article per|haps may make you amends, I mean the Appear|ance of the grand Arch-Angel of all, and, as I &s;up|po&s;e, the only Arch-Angel out of Heaven, namely the Devil.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the <HI>APPEARANCE</HI> of the <HI>DEVIL</HI> in Humane Shape.</HEAD>
<P>PRAY ob&s;erve, when I am &s;peaking of the Ap|pearance of the Devil, it is not to tell you that he can and does appear among us at this time; &s;o you need not look over your Shoulders to &s;ee for him, or at the Candles, to &s;ee
<PB N="22" REF="33">
if they burn BLUE, at lea&s;t not yet; 'tis time enough for that by and by.</P>
<P>BUT I am examining now the matter of Fact only, as (1.) Whether the Devil can appear here, yea or no; whether he is allow'd to come, that his Chain reaches &s;o far, and that his Tether is long enough? al&s;o, (2.) Whether he is ever &s;ent or directed to come, or that he comes of his own accord, and a|bout his own Bu&s;ine&s;s? And as all the&s;e will lead me to enquire what has been; from thence we may be&s;t judge, what is, or may be.</P>
<P>THAT he has upon &s;pecial Occa&s;ions appear'd in former Times is certain, as well from Scripture as ancient Hi&s;tory, and a &s;mall Retro&s;pect will &s;atisfie you in that Point. If it appears that he has been here, then 'tis very probable his Chain is long e|nough, and that he is allow'd the Liberty to come &s;o far from Home. For we have no Authority to &s;ay, or to believe, that his Tether is &s;horten'd, or that he is more re&s;train'd now than ever he was before.</P>
<P>HIS entring the Garden of God in the begin|ning of Time, and the Havock he made there, the turning <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> out, and even turning the whole frame of Nature up&s;ide down by his vile Doings there; all this I have mention'd: But we have more yet to &s;ay of him; for he is &s;till in Being, and &s;till the &s;ame malicious Devil, the &s;ame De|&s;troyer and Accu&s;er that ever he was; the Flame of Fire &s;et to guard the Garden, did not burn him; the Deluge didn't drown him: Nor has Ju&s;tice thought fit yet to take him into its Iron Hands, tho' it will certainly do it at la&s;t; and, as the Scri|pture &s;ays in another Ca&s;e, his Damnation &s;lum|bereth not; for Ju&s;tice is truly repre&s;ented</P>
<Q><L>With Leaden Feet and Iron Hands, to &s;how</L>
<L>It will be certain, tho' it may be &s;low.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="23" REF="34">
THE fir&s;t time we meet with the Devil's per|&s;onal Appearance upon Earth, I mean after the Flood, is in the Story of <HI>Job;</HI> nor by all the Cal|culations of Times, which the learned Chronolo|gers of tho&s;e Days have made, could that be long after it; for <HI>Eliphaz</HI> the <HI>Temanite</HI> could not be far|ther off than the Grand&s;on of <HI>E&s;au,</HI> or thereabouts. Gen. xxxvi. 11.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Job</HI>'s Time, the Text &s;ays that <HI>the Sons of God came to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the Lord, and</HI> Satan <HI>came al&s;o among them.</HI> So that it &s;eems the Angel of Light was dre&s;s'd up like the Sons of GOD, even in tho&s;e ancient Days; and it is not likely that this was the fir&s;t Time neither: Again, it &s;eems by the Text, that tho' GOD him&s;elf might know Satan in that Di&s;gui&s;e, yet the People, among whom he came, did not know him.</P>
<P>THE An&s;wer likewi&s;e which he makes to the Que|&s;tion, implies &s;trongly, that Satan had been wont to walk among tho&s;e Sons of God in Di&s;gui&s;e long before that; for when God &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s to him, <HI>whence come&s;t thou?</HI> his An&s;wer &s;eems to be a kind of gene|ral, I come from following my known Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, my old Trade; doe&s;t thou know I am a roar|ing Lion, and doe&s;t thou ask me whence I come? Why, I come from &s;eeking who I may devour, ranging the World, <HI>going to and fro in the Earth,</HI> and <HI>walking up and down</HI> in this Di&s;gui&s;e, as thou now &s;ee&s;t me, that I may do all the Mi&s;chief I can.</P>
<P>GOD'S Return again to Satan confirms it, as if the Lord had &s;aid; Well, Satan, then thou mu&s;t have &s;een my Servant <HI>Job? Ha&s;t thou con&s;ider'd</HI> him, <HI>that there is none like him in the Earth?</HI></P>
<P>THE Devil makes an An&s;wer that implies he knew <HI>Job</HI> very well. Do I know him to be a good Man! yes: But then I know him to be a rich Man too: 'Tis an ea&s;y thing for a Man to be hone&s;t, that is &s;o rich; he can have no room for asking
<PB N="24" REF="35">
more: What &s;hould he &s;teal for, or be a Knave for, that is the riche&s;t Man in the World? What &s;hould he covet, that has no room for De&s;ire? But if thou ha&s;t a Mind to try his Hone&s;ty, and his Piety, his Fear of thee, and his Hatred of Evil, bla&s;t his Wealth, and take his prodigious Flocks and Herds of Cattle away; level him, bring him to be like other Men in Riches, and reduce him to Beggary, and then &s;ee if he won't be like other Men in Crime; nay, he'll be raging and furious, and <HI>cur&s;e thee to thy Face.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, tho' it may &s;eem remote, is to my Pur|pop&s;e thus: it &s;hows that the Devil was no Stran|ger among the People. He had walk'd up and down in Di&s;gui&s;e, &s;o as to know them all, and their Circum&s;tance; He had been dre&s;s'd up like one of the re&s;t in Human Shape, &s;o that he could not be known from the very be&s;t of Men, no not from the Sons of God.</P>
<P>SOME are of Opinion, by <HI>the Sons of God</HI> there, is meant the patriarchal Heads of Families, who had, in right of Primogeniture, the Prie&s;thood in Cour&s;e, and were the only Sacrificers at that Time, as <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> and as <HI>Job</HI> were; &s;o that in &s;hort Satan has long ago dre&s;s'd him&s;elf in the Habit of the Clergy. Ble&s;s us all! we hope he does not do &s;o &s;till; for if the Devil &s;hould put on the Gown and Ca&s;&s;ock, or the black Cloak, or the Coat and the Cord, and be walking about the World in that Di&s;gui&s;e now, how ea&s;ily may we be cheated, and mi&s;take the Sons of God for the Prince of Darkne&s;s? and how could we tell one from t'other?

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Apparition of Spirits Unembodied, and which never were Embodied; not &s;uch as are vulgarly called Gho&s;ts, that is to &s;ay, departed Souls returning again and appear|ing vi&s;ibly on Earth, but Spirits of a &s;upe|rior and angelick Nature; with an Opinion of another Species.</HEAD>
<P>THERE appears a Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion here in the very Beginning of the Debate, which will be ve|ry hard to decide, and perhaps impo&s;&s;ible: How|ever, that we may not &s;tumble at the Thre&s;hold, I will touch it as gently, and yet as clearly as I can. The Que&s;tion is this; Whether are there any Spirits inhabiting the invi&s;ible World, which have never yet been embodied, and yet are not to be reckon'd of the Species of Angels <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Bad?</HI></P>
<P>BY Angels Good and Bad, I &s;uppo&s;e I may be ea&s;ily unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tood to mean what you all think you mean when you &s;ort or rank them into only two Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Angels or <HI>Devils;</HI> in which vulgar and gene|ral, not to &s;ay fooli&s;h way of expre&s;&s;ing it, I hum|bly conceive the &s;elf-wi&s;e World much mi&s;taken. It is true it is a Speculation, and every one is at Liberty to think for them&s;elves, and among them &s;o am I; in which, tho' I have a better Opinion of my own Judgment than always to &s;acrifice it to vulgar Notions, and that too at the Price of my Rea&s;on; yet I have withal &s;o little Pride, and &s;o mean an Opinion of my own Thoughts, that I &s;hall not venture to advance any thing, in a Ca&s;e &s;o ex|ceedingly liable to Cavil and Exception.</P>
<P>TWO Places in Scripture &s;peak of Angels in a dif|ferent Style from the ordinary and u&s;ual way of under&s;tanding
<PB N="26" REF="37">
the Word. <HI>Mat.</HI> xviii. 10. &s;peaking of little Children, Chri&s;t &s;ays, that <HI>in Heaven their An|gels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven:</HI> the other is <HI>Acts</HI> xii. 15. when <HI>Peter</HI> knock'd at the Door where the Di&s;ciples were ga|ther'd together, and they believing him to be in Chains, and in the Pri&s;on, &s;aid <HI>it is his Angel.</HI></P>
<P>THE learned Expo&s;itors and Annotators ex|tremely differ upon the Meaning of the&s;e Texts, and 'tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to reconcile them. Some will have it to mean nothing but a kind of an Exclamation or Admiration; What can it be! is it an Angel! And of the fir&s;t, about Children, they &s;ay it only intimates, that their Souls, when glorify'd, &s;hall <HI>always,</HI> if they go away in Peace, <HI>behold the Face of GOD in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>OTHERS run out to an imaginary Scheme of Guardian Angels attending every Man and Woman while they are upon Earth; a Notion &s;o uncertain, if granted, and that has &s;o many Difficulties to re|concile, before it can be believed, that 'tis much better to leave it where it is, and which I &s;hall ex|plain pre&s;ently a much ea&s;ier Way.</P>
<P>NOW, I &s;ay, 'tis not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to re|concile the&s;e di&s;tant and cla&s;hing Opinions, at lea&s;t not in this Work. I have &s;tarted a Que&s;tion; po&s;&s;i|bly my Opinion is with the affirmative, at lea&s;t I think it po&s;&s;ible, and that it is Rational to believe it; perhaps I may name you as improbable a Notion, and much more incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian Religion, which yet Philo&s;ophy bids us call rational, and directs us to believe.</P>
<P>HOW are we put to it to form Inhabitants for the Planetary Worlds: Philo&s;ophy &s;ays they are ha|bitable Bodies, &s;olid, opaac, as this Earth, and we will have them be inhabited al&s;o, whether it be with or without, for or again&s;t our Rea&s;on and Un|der&s;tanding; 'tis no Satisfaction to them, or will it
<PB N="27" REF="38">
&s;top their Cavils, to &s;ay 'tis not Fact; that they are not habitable; that both <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> are un|comfortably dark, un&s;ufferably cold, would congeal the very Soul (if that were po&s;&s;ible) and &s;o are not habi|table on that Account; that <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> are in&s;ufferably hot, that the very Water would always boyl, the Fire burn up the Vitals; and that, in &s;hort, no human Creatures could &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;uch Heat: But this is not &s;atisfactory neither; but rather than not have all tho&s;e opaac Worlds be inhabited, and even their <HI>Satellites</HI> or Moons about them too, they will have God be obliged to create a Species of Bo|dies &s;uitable to their &s;everal Climates.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Saturn</HI> they are to live without Eyes, or be a Kind &s;o illuminated from their own internal Heat and Light, that they can &s;ee &s;ufficiently by their own Beams.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Jupiter</HI> there mu&s;t be another Kind, that can live in Twilight, and by the Reflection of its own Moons, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t in continued Fro&s;t.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Mercury</HI> the Species mu&s;t be all Salamanders, and live in the continued Fire of the Sun's Beams, more inten&s;e than what would be &s;ufficient to burn all our Hou&s;es, and melt our Copper, Lead, and Iron in the very Mines; &s;o the Inhabitants mu&s;t be of a Kind better able to bear the Fire than tho&s;e Metals, and would &s;till live tho' they were continu|ally calcining if not vitrifying into Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Venus</HI> the Heat would boil the Water, and con|&s;equently the Blood in the Body, and a Set of hu|man Bodies mu&s;t be form'd that could live always in a hot Bath, and neither &s;weat out their Souls, or melt their Bodies.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Mars,</HI> &s;o very dry in its Nature, no Vegetables or Sen&s;atives could &s;ub&s;i&s;t that we have any Notion of, for want of Moi&s;ture; and the Men that liv'd there mu&s;t be dried up &s;ufficiently for pulverizing on any &s;uitable Occa&s;ion, I mean human Beings, and of our Species.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="39">
NOW if God mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have crea|ted &s;o many habitable Bodies without peopling them, and that it would reflect upon his Wi&s;dom to lay &s;o much of his Creation wa&s;te; that all the Planets &s;hould &s;eem to be made for nothing but to range about the Wa&s;te as a kind of dark Inhabitants; of no u&s;e but to &s;hine a little, and that with but bor|row'd Beams too, upon this little Point called Earth, where only a Set of Rationals can exi&s;t; I &s;ay, if this mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, but on the con|trary there are certainly People of one Kind or another in all tho&s;e Bodies, let the Trouble of ma|king them be what it will; if this be the Ca&s;e, and that this mu&s;t be believed in &s;pight of &s;o ma|ny Difficulties and Incon&s;i&s;tencies; then allow me to argue a little upon the following Enquiry.</P>
<P>WHY may I not as well &s;ugge&s;t, and that with every jot as much Probability, that there are, or at lea&s;t may be, a certain Number of appointed Inha|bitants in the va&s;tly-extended Aby&s;s of Space, a kind of Spirits (other than the Angels good or bad, and other than the unembodied or unca&s;ed Souls of Men) who dwell in the invi&s;ible World, and in the Va&s;t <HI>No-where</HI> of unbounded Space, of which we can neither &s;ay what it is, what it contains, or how determined: That Great Wa&s;te, of who&s;e Extent 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible even the Soul it&s;elf can conceive, and of which all the Accounts we give, and Gue&s;&s;es we make, are &s;o remote, look &s;o Enthu&s;ia&s;tic, &s;o improbable, and &s;o like impo&s;&s;ible, that in&s;tead of informing the ignorant Part of the World by it, we only arm them with Je&s;t and Ridicule, and re|&s;olve them into incurable Unbelief; depending that what it is not po&s;&s;ible to Conceive of, is not po&s;&s;i|ble to Be.</P>
<P>NOW is this immen&s;e Space indeed a Void? is it all a Wa&s;te? is it utterly de&s;olate? or is it inhabited and peopled by the Omnipotent Maker, in a manner
<PB N="29" REF="40">
&s;uited to his own Glory, and with &s;uch Inhabitants as are &s;pirituous, invi&s;ible, and therefore perfectly proper to the Place?</P>
<P>I MUST needs &s;ay, 'tis much more rational to &s;ugge&s;t this to be, than to bring out a Species of human bodies to live in the Inten&s;e Heat of <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> or the acute Cold of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn.</HI> The latter is agreeable to the general Under&s;tanding we all have of &s;pirituous Beings: We are well a&s;|&s;ured there are &s;ome always there, and that they can very well &s;ub&s;i&s;t there; that the Place is &s;uit|able to them, and that there are Spirits of &s;ome Kind or other; and why not &s;uch as we &s;ugge&s;t?</P>
<P>IT remains then only to examine what Commu|nication the&s;e Spirits have with us, whether they are or are not able to hold Conver&s;ation with us, and whether they really do conver&s;e familiarly with us, yea or no?</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be granted that there are &s;uch Spi|rits in Being, and that they pa&s;s and repa&s;s, exi&s;t, and have Egre&s;s and Regre&s;s there; that they inha|bit, as a certain bomba&s;tic Author has it,
<Q><L>Thro' all the liquid Mazes of the Sky;</L></Q>
I &s;ay, if this &s;hould be granted, then it remains that here is a fourth Species that may a&s;&s;ume Shapes; for Spirits may do that, and may appear among us, may conver&s;e with our embodied Spirits, and from tho&s;e we may receive abundance of additional In|telligence from the World of Spirits, whether by Dream, Vi&s;ion, Appearance, or any &s;uperior way, &s;uch as to them in their great Knowledge of things &s;hall &s;eem meet. To &s;peak as di&s;tinctly of this nice Part as I can, admit me to explain my &s;elf a little.</P>
<P>IF we grant that Spirit, tho' invi&s;ible in it &s;elf, may a&s;&s;ume Shape, may ve&s;t it &s;elf &s;o with Fle&s;h and Blood, that is &s;eemingly, &s;o as to form an Appearance,
<PB N="30" REF="41">
then all Spitit may do it; &s;ince we have no Rule given us by which we may di&s;tingui&s;h Spirits one from another, I mean as to their act|ings in the Capacity of Spirits: We may indeed, as I have &s;aid already, di&s;tingui&s;h them by the Ef|fect, that is to &s;ay, by the Errand they come on, and by the manner of their Operations, as whe|ther they are good or evil Spirits; but not by their Nature as Spirit. The <HI>Devil</HI> is as really a Spirit, tho' a degenerated, fallen, and evil Spirit, I &s;ay, he is as much a Spirit to all the In|tents and Purpo&s;es of a Spirit that we are capable to judge of, as an Angel; and he is called the evil Spirit; He has Invi&s;ibility, and Multipre&s;ence, as a Spirit has; he can appear tho' the Doors be &s;hut; and go out, tho' bolted and barr'd in; no Pri&s;on can hold him, but his la&s;t eternal Dungeon; no Chains can bind him, but the Chains fa&s;ten'd on him by Heaven, and the Angel of the bottom|le&s;s Pit; no Engine or human Art can wound him; in &s;hort, he is neither to be &s;een, felt, heard, or under&s;tood, unle&s;s he plea&s;es; and he can make him|&s;elf be both &s;een and heard too, if he plea&s;es; for he can a&s;&s;ume the Shape and Appearance of Man or Bea&s;t, and in the&s;e Shapes and Appearances can make him&s;elf vi&s;ible to us, terrify and affright us, conver&s;e in a friendly or in a frightful manner with us, as he thinks fit; he can be a Companion and Fellow-Traveller in the Day, an Apparition and a horrible Mon&s;ter in the Night: in a Word, he can be among us, and act upon, and with us, vi&s;ibly or invi&s;ibly as he plea&s;es, and as he finds for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>NOW if he does, and can do thus, meerly as he is a Spirit, and by his &s;piritual Nature, we have a great deal of Rea&s;on to believe, that all Spirit may do the &s;ame; or at lea&s;t I may ask, Why may not all Spirit do the &s;ame? and if there are any Kinds
<PB N="31" REF="42">

<P>IF any Man asks me how I make out the Pro|bability of the&s;e differing Species of Spirits? I an|&s;wer as above, by this, That it appears there are invi&s;ible Operations and a &s;ecret Conver&s;e carried on among Men from the World of Spirits, where-ever that is, which cannot, at lea&s;t to our Under&s;tandings, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Work either of tho&s;e particular or proper Angels which re&s;ide in Heaven, or the in|fernal Angels either; that the&s;e Spirits, or if you plea&s;e to call them Angels, appear and conver&s;e for Good, and therefore may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>De|vil,</HI> or from the <HI>Devil:</HI> It is &s;aid indeed, that they act by a vi&s;ible kind of Re&s;traint, in doing Good with a &s;ort of an Imperfection and manife&s;t Debility; &s;o as &s;ometimes to act, as it were, to no purpo&s;e, being not able to make the Good they aim at effectual, and therefore cannot be from Heaven, the Foun|tain of Good; who, as he is Good, &s;o he is in|finitely able to do all the Good that he appears willing to do: But this, I think, confirms rather than confutes my Opinion; for, it proves them to be &s;ent, and under particular Commi&s;&s;ion; it only &s;ugge&s;ts, that 'tis probable there are Spirits who may be more confin'd and re&s;train'd in their Power of acting, &s;ome than others, and this is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the thing.</P>
<P>THE great, and perhaps the &s;tronge&s;t Argu|ment which our learned Men produce for the Credit of their new Philo&s;ophy is, that by this they can the better &s;olve the Difficulties of &s;eve|ral other <HI>Phoenomena,</HI> which before were hardly intelligible, or at lea&s;t which they could not ac|count for any other way.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="43">

<P>WHAT can it be that communicates the&s;e ap|proaching di&s;tant things, and which it is &s;o much our Intere&s;t and Concern to know?

<P>ON the other hand, it cannot be from Heaven or from the Angels; for the Works of God are all, like him&s;elf, perfect, and he would not &s;o far di&s;ho|nour his Me&s;&s;engers, as to allow them, nay to &s;end them (for they could never come un&s;ent) to give us Notice of Evil, and yet take it out of our Power to avoid it; or to foretell good things at hand, and then give us no Power to embrace them, or to lay hold of them; and it would neither con&s;i&s;t with the infinite Goodne&s;s, or with the infinite Ju&s;tice, to do thus by his Creatures.</P>

namely, to burn the City.

<P>BUT the kind Me&s;&s;engers do not &s;atisfie them|&s;elves with giving him the Warning, but they rou&s;e up his Indolence.

<P>ANOTHER is in the Story of <HI>Peter</HI> in the Pri&s;on: an Angel is &s;ent to deliver him, <HI>Acts</HI> xii. and what does the Angel do? a Light &s;hin'd in the Pri&s;on, and he &s;mote him on the Side; this was to awaken and alarm him; this, and a Light to &s;how him the Way, was &s;ufficient to have put him upon trying to e&s;cape.

<P>THIS was an Appearance or Apparition to the Purpo&s;e; and &s;uch have been all tho&s;e Tran&s;actions of Heaven, which have been under the Hands of expre&s;s Me&s;&s;engers.

<P>NOW let us &s;ee how it has far'd with tho&s;e who have receiv'd Notices of approaching Danger from the invi&s;ible World, by the Hands of other Me&s;|&s;engers.</P>
<P><HI>JULIUS CAESAR</HI> had &s;everal Hints given him of his approaching Fate; one particular South&s;ayer pointed out the very Day to him, namely, <HI>the Ides of March,</HI> but he had no Power to avoid his Fate. The kind Spirit that foreboded, and gave hints to him, that he was in Danger, as if contented with having done his parr, left him to be murther'd. No A&s;&s;i&s;tance given him to rouze up his Spirits to take the Alarm: He is not led by the Hand, and told, <HI>go not into the Senate Hou&s;e,</HI> as was done for <HI>Lot; e&s;cape for thy Life.</HI> The kind Monitor does not name the Traytors and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators to him, and &s;ay <HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius, Ca&s;ca,</HI> and others, wait there to kill you; as the Angel to <HI>Jo&s;eph, Herod will &s;eek the young Child to de&s;troy him.</HI></P>
<P>AND on the other &s;ide, <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> bold and unalarm'd, indolent, and having things not &s;ufficiently explain'd to him; (and the good Spirit, as may be &s;uppos'd, able to do no more for him;) goes on, enters the Senate Hou&s;e, mocks the South&s;ayer, and tells him
<PB N="41" REF="52">

<P><HI>JULIAN</HI> the Apo&s;tate is another Example: He had a thou&s;and ill Omens, as they call'd them, which attended him at and before his undertaking the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> War; &s;uch as the dying of the Con&s;ul <HI>Julianus</HI> of his own Name, the burning of the Tem|ple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and &s;everal other Accidents; and tho' he was the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious of all the Heathen Emperors that were before him, and &s;ent to all the Oracles, to all the Augurs and South&s;ayers he could hear of, in&s;omuch that the Citizens of <HI>Antioch</HI> made a Je&s;t of him for it; Yet he was &s;o blinded by his Flatterers, or deluded by the Prie&s;ts, who con&s;trued the wor&s;t and mo&s;t portentous things, to mean the be&s;t Events; or, which is beyond it all, by the &s;u|perior Decree of an appointed Vengeance; that he went on and was kill'd in the very beginning of the War; the fir&s;t Battel with the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> carried him off.</P>
<P>I MIGHT multiply Examples of the like kind, even on both &s;ides, and e&s;pecially on the la&s;t; but 'tis &s;ufficient; our own Experience will confirm it: &s;ecret Notices are daily given us of capital Dangers attending, and yet how do the mo&s;t vigilant Ob|&s;ervers of tho&s;e Signals, and the mo&s;t eminent O|men-Hunters, even after tho&s;e Notices, &s;it &s;till, and grow indolent? or el&s;e, amaz'd and bewilder'd, they &s;ay, I know there's &s;omething a coming to me, &s;ome Mi&s;chief attends me, I have plain Notice of it; but I don't know what it is, I can't tell what to do; I can do nothing to avoid or prevent it. And thus they fall into the Pit, as we may &s;ay, with their Eyes open, and in &s;pight of the kind Spirit's beneficent Warning.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53">
WHAT can this be? but becau&s;e the Spirit, tho' really kind and beneficent, yet limited and impo|tent in Power, was able to do no more than to give the Hint, leaving the Per&s;on to his own Prudence to guard and direct him&s;elf?</P>
<P>I MIGHT add here what 'tis rational enough to &s;ugge&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that Heaven in its infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s may have appointed the&s;e Good Spirits to give &s;uch Notices, yet allowing them to do no more, that the Mind of Man being duly alarm'd at approaching Evil, and believing &s;ome|thing very fatal to him is at Hand; but &s;eeing no kind Being directing what M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">thods to take for his Deliverance, or for e&s;caping the impending Mi&s;|chief, &s;hould turn his Eyes (at lea&s;t) a little upwards, and call for Direction and Council from that Hand, who alone can both direct and deliver.</P>
<P>BUT hold! whither am I going? This looks like Religion, and we mu&s;t not talk a Word of that, if we expect to be agreeable. Unhappy Times! where to be &s;erious, is to be dull and grave, and con&s;equently to write without Spirit.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Appearance of Departed Unembo|died Soul.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW come to the main and mo&s;t di&s;puted Part of &s;hadowy Appearance, <HI>viz.</HI> the Appari|tion of Unembodied Soul.</P>
<P>IT is a material Difficulty here, and ought to be con&s;ider'd with the utmo&s;t Plainne&s;s, <HI>(viz.)</HI> what we mean by <HI>Unembodied Soul;</HI> whether we under|&s;tand Souls which have been encas'd in Fle&s;h, but be|ing unhous'd are now moving about, in what State we know not, and are to be &s;poken of as in their &s;eparate Capacity: Or whether there is any &s;uch thing as a Ma&s;s of Soul, as a learned but pretty much incon&s;i&s;tent W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iter calls it, which waits to be embodied, as the &s;uperior Di&s;po&s;er of that Affair, (be that who or what he plea&s;es) may direct.</P>
<P>THIS I confe&s;s is to me &s;omething unintelligi|ble, looks a little <HI>Platonick,</HI> and as if it were a-kin to the Tran&s;migration-Whim&s;ie of the Ancients; but if they would found it upon any thing rational, it mu&s;t be upon the Sugge&s;tion mention'd above, <HI>viz.</HI> of a middle Cla&s;s of Spirit, neither Angelick|Heavenly, or Angelick-Infernal: But Spirits inha|biting the invi&s;ible Spaces, and allow'd to act and appear here, under expre&s;s and greatly &s;train'd Li|mitations, &s;uch as are already de&s;crib'd, and of which much more may &s;till be &s;aid.</P>
<P>BUT that I may clear up your Doubt as to the Part I am upon, I have added at the Head of this Section, the Word <HI>Departed,</HI> to intimate to you, that I am Orthodox in my Notion; that I am none of the Sect of Soul-Sleepers, or for impri&s;oning
<PB N="45" REF="56">
Souls in a <HI>Limbus</HI> of the Ancients; but that, in a few Words, by the Appearance of Souls Unembo|died, I mean &s;uch as having been embodied or im|pri&s;on'd in Fle&s;h, are di&s;charg'd from that Confine|ment, or as I call it unhous'd and turn'd out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. For I cannot agree that the Soul is in the Body, as in a Pri&s;on; but rather that, like a rich Nobleman, he is pleas'd to inhabit a fine Country Seat or Palace of his own Building, where he re&s;olves to live and enjoy him&s;elf, and does &s;o, 'till by the Fate of things his fine Palace being over-turn'd, whether by an Earthquake or otherwi&s;e, is bury'd in its own Ruins, and the noble Owner turn'd out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS Soul, we are told, and I concur in the O|pinion, has &s;ometimes made a Tour back into this World; whether Earth, or the Atmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">phere of the Earth, call it where you will, and expre&s;s it how you will, it matters not much: Whence it comes, how far the Journey, how, and why it came hither, and a|bove all, how it goes back again, and what tho&s;e various Apparitions are which counterfeit the&s;e Spirits: enquire within, and you &s;hall know farther.</P>
<P>THAT the Unembodied Souls of Men Dead, as we &s;ay Departed, have appeared, we have af|firm'd from the Authority of the Scripture; which I mu&s;t allow to be an authentick Document, what|ever the Reader may plea&s;e to do; 'till a Hi&s;tory more authentick, and of better Authority may be produc'd in the Room of it.</P>
<P>AS to the Appearance of <HI>Samuel,</HI> rais'd by the Witch, I de&s;pi&s;e it, as it is offer'd in the Capacity of a Soul, much more as the Unembodied Soul of <HI>Samuel;</HI> which tho' it might have been caus'd to appear, as the Sovereign of all Spirits, with whom the Soul of <HI>Samuel</HI> is at Re&s;t, had thought fit; yet could no more be &s;ummon'd from that Re&s;t, by
<PB N="46" REF="57">
the Conjuration of an old Witch, than the <HI>Devil</HI> could fetch it out of Heaven by Force. Nor was it likely that God, who refus'd &s;o much as to &s;peak to that abandon'd Prince, whom he had &s;o righteou&s;ly re|jected, and that would an&s;wer him neither by <HI>Urim,</HI> or by <HI>Thummim,</HI> that would neither hear his Prayer, or accept his Offering, would hear a Witch, a Creature likewi&s;e &s;entenc'd to Death by his own righteous Law, and &s;end <HI>Samuel</HI> at her Infernal Paw-wawing from Heaven, to tell <HI>Saul</HI> that to|morrow he &s;hould be cut in Pieces by the <HI>Phili|&s;tines;</HI> there &s;eems to be no Con&s;i&s;tency at all in it, no, none at all.</P>
<P>THE Appearance of the Thing call'd <HI>Samuel,</HI> was, in my Opinion, neither more or le&s;s than a Phanta&s;m or Spectre, which (as the <HI>Devil</HI> is allow'd to do) might per&s;onate the old departed Prophet, and who, at the Witch's Summons, and by Hea|ven's Permi&s;&s;ion, came up to pronounce the dread|ful Sentence upon <HI>Saul,</HI> and let him &s;ee what was the Effect of his for&s;aking God, and rejecting his Prophet <HI>Samuel.</HI> And thus it might be allow'd al&s;o to &s;peak in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of the Prophet, as it did; nor do I &s;ay, or think, as &s;ome do, that it was the <HI>Devil</HI> in <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Likene&s;s; if it had, 'tis not likely the old Woman would have been &s;o frighted as to cry out, &s;eeing &s;he was better acquainted with the <HI>Devil,</HI> than to be &s;urpriz'd, if it had been her old Familiar.</P>
<P>BUT &s;he &s;aw &s;omething &s;he did not expect, and perhaps had never &s;een before; for &s;he tells the King, &s;he &s;aw Gods a&s;cending out of the Earth; by which I cannot but under&s;tand, &s;he &s;aw &s;ome of tho&s;e Spirits which I have mention'd, which are not Infernal, and who might fore&s;ee what the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf cannot; for I have no rea&s;on to be|lieve that Satan knows any thing of Futurity.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="58">
IF it be asked here, by what Authority the Witch could bring up one even of the&s;e Spirits; that in|deed may be difficult to an&s;wer, other than thus, that it might be as <HI>Balaam</HI> was over-rul'd to ble&s;s, when he intended to cur&s;e; and that at her Call, and to pronounce the approaching Fate of <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with him, &s;he might be over-rul'd, and &s;o call'd up, or call'd in, a good Spirit in&s;tead of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>AS for the Spectre's &s;peaking in the Name of <HI>Samuel</HI> in the Scripture, and the Text repre&s;en|ting it as if it were really <HI>Samuel</HI> him&s;elf, 1 Sam. xxviii. 15. <HI>And</HI> Samuel <HI>&s;aid to</HI> Saul, <HI>why ha&s;t thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;quieted me, to bring me up?</HI> I take it to be an Ex|pre&s;&s;ion <HI>ad Hominem,</HI> to the common Under&s;tanding, and to be under&s;tood as all Allegorick or Figurative Expre&s;&s;ions are under&s;tood; and it no more proves that it was <HI>Samuel,</HI> and is no more to be taken lit|terally, than the other Words in the &s;ame Ver&s;e are to be litterally under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHY ha&s;t thou di&s;quieted me?</HI> as if it was in <HI>Saul</HI>'s Power, by the Conjurations of an ab|horr'd condemn'd Limb of the <HI>Devil,</HI> a pro&s;crib'd Witch, to di&s;quiet the departed Soul of <HI>Samuel;</HI> the Meaning is no more than this, What is your Bu|&s;ine&s;s with me, what do you trouble me for? You that de&s;pi&s;ed me, and acted contrary to all my Di|rections, and would go on in your Perver&s;ene&s;s in &s;pite of me, and of all I could &s;ay to you; what do you come to me for, now I am dead?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>TO bring me up?</HI> intimating that <HI>Samuel</HI> was below, or was called <HI>ab Inferis;</HI> which is contrary to Rea&s;on as well as Religion, and neither con&s;i&s;ts either with our Notion, or any body's el&s;e, except it be the Soul-&s;leepers, who tell us, the Soul &s;leeps with the Body in the Grave 'till the Re&s;urrection; and if &s;o, then mu&s;t the old Woman have had Power to awake him whenever &s;he pleas'd.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="59">
UPON the whole, it &s;eems this Woman was a Witch of &s;ome Eminency, and had more than or|dinary Power in her way. For when <HI>Saul</HI> applies to her, &s;he asks him, Whom &s;hall I bring up? inti|mating that &s;he was able to bring up who &s;he would, either from <HI>Heaven</HI> or <HI>Hell.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Boldne&s;s plainly infers, that &s;he had no Power at all, but this; that being a Witch, and one that had a Familiar Spirit, &s;he could cau&s;e her Familiar or Devil, call it what we will, to appear and per&s;onate who &s;he pleas'd to name. For why &s;hould not the <HI>Devil</HI> be as able to dre&s;s him&s;elf up like one dead Per&s;on, as another? and why not appear as well in the Shape of a dead Man, as of a living One?</P>
<P>SO that to me there is no more Difficulty in his Dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf like <HI>Samuel,</HI> than there was in calling him&s;elf &s;o, or than &s;peaking in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of <HI>Samuel,</HI> as above; Why di&s;quiet ME, and why bring ME up? All that &s;eems inexplicable in it is, how he &s;hould be able to tell <HI>Saul</HI> what &s;hould happen, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that GOD would deliver <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into the Hands of the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> and him <HI>(Saul)</HI> with them, and that to-morrow he &s;hould be with him; that is, among the Dead, &s;hould be killed in the Battel. This indeed has &s;omething difficult in it, becau&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> is not allow'd to be a Prophet, or able to predict what is to come. But the&s;e things may be all an&s;wer'd by the Story of <HI>Balaam,</HI> where the wicked Creature, tho' a Wizard, and a Conjurer, yet was directed, not only to ble&s;s <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in &s;pite of all the Gifts and Rewards that the King of <HI>Moab</HI> offer'd him, but was enabled to prophe&s;y of Chri&s;t, and foretel the glorious appearing of the Me&s;&s;iah; Numb. xxiv. 17. <HI>I &s;hall &s;ee him but</HI> not now, <HI>I &s;hall bohold him but</HI> not nigh; <HI>There &s;hall come</HI> a Star <HI>out of</HI> Jacob, <HI>and</HI> a Scepter <HI>&s;hall ari&s;e out of</HI> I&s;rael; and again, <HI>out of</HI> JACOB <HI>&s;hall come he that &s;hall have Dominion.</HI> This was a plain and direct Prophecy

<P><PB N="50" REF="61">
AN Apparition is vulgarly call'd by us a Gho&s;t, by our Northern People a <HI>Ghe&s;t;</HI> now the Gho&s;t is a Spirit, and the Apparition of a Spirit has &s;ome Sen&s;e in it; the Spirits al&s;o a&s;&s;uming a Shape or Body, whether Real, or in Appearance only, has &s;omething in it to be talk'd about; but the Apparitions of Body, moving, appearing, walking, or whatever we may call it, without Soul or Spirit, is what was ne|ver heard of, and &s;carce ever &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e Apparitions quo|ted from the Scripture, are not Apparitions in Vi&s;i|on; Dreams in the Night, or &s;uppo&s;ed Appearances only, but plain, open, day-light Vi&s;ions; the for|mer would not be to my purpo&s;e at all. The&s;e were Apparitions that were &s;poken to, and con|ver&s;ed with; and this is a Proof of what I al|ledge, <HI>viz.</HI> that Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s Unembodied may appear, may rea&s;&s;ume humane Shape, their own former Likene&s;s, or any other, and may &s;how them&s;elves to the World, or to as many Per&s;ons as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Difficulties which attend this are not a few, tho' none of them de&s;troy the thing it &s;elf; as (1.) Whether the Souls of good or bad People unembo|died, are really in a State or Condition for &s;uch an Appearance? and whether it con&s;i&s;ts with the ju&s;t Notions we ought to have of the unalterable State? I mean &s;uch Notions as conform to the Scripture, which, if the Parable of the rich Man and <HI>Lazarus</HI> be a ju&s;t Repre&s;entation of it, &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to be, except on &s;uch an extraordinary Occa&s;ion as that of our Saviour's Transfiguration and Re&s;ur|rection; that is, by Miracle.</P>
<P><HI>LAZARUS,</HI> &s;ays the Text, was, upon his Death, carried by the Angels into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bo&s;om; the rich Man died, and in Hell he lift up his Eyes. That this is &s;uppos'd to be immediately, is evident, becau&s;e the rich Man &s;peaks of his Brethren that were then alive: If he was not carried thither immediately,
<PB N="51" REF="62">
he would certainly not have been carried there at all 'till after the Great <HI>Audit;</HI> &s;o that it was plain he was there pre&s;ently after his Death: and that <HI>Lazarus</HI> was carried immediately to Hea|ven is evident al&s;o; becau&s;e the rich Man is brought in &s;eeing him there, and de&s;iring he may be &s;ent to him.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay this is but a Parable, is to &s;ay what may be granted without Prejudice to the Point in hand. For as it is a Parable, it would not have been ap|po&s;ite, if it had not repre&s;ented things as they were really to be; it would have been a Delu&s;ion, and brought to deceive; whereas it is a Parable of our Lord's own bringing, and all tho&s;e Parables that Chri&s;t uttered, were the mo&s;t perfect Repre&s;entati|ons and Illu&s;trations of the things which they were brought to &s;et forth; nor is any one of them lame in their Allu&s;ions, but in&s;tructive in every Article; as the Parable of the Prodigal Son, for Example, and the Parable of the King making a Marriage for his Son, and &s;o of the re&s;t. And why mu&s;t this a|lone be lame, and unapt for the purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>IF then this Parable is &s;uited to repre&s;ent the State of the Souls of the Departed, tho&s;e Souls then can no w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> be concern'd in the Apparitions which we are &s;peaking of; except as is before excepted, <HI>viz.</HI> on &s;uch extraordinary Occa&s;ions, as that of our Savi|our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t be acknowledg'd to be.</P>
<P>IF then, neither the Souls or Spirits of the Ble&s;|&s;ed or the Cur&s;ed, the Happy or Mi&s;erable, the Sav'd or the Condemn'd, are concern'd in tho&s;e Appearances, who then are the&s;e Inhabitants of the invi&s;ible World? What are they that con&s;titute and po&s;&s;e&s;s this World of Spirits, &s;o much talk'd of? And if the immen&s;e Spac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s are taken up, if they are peopled by any &s;pirituous Creatures, if any thing but Stars and Planets range through the <HI>empty Place,</HI> as <HI>Job</HI> calls it, <HI>Job</HI> xxvi. 7. what are

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Manner How the Spirits of every Kind, which can or do appear among us, manage their Appearance; and How they proceed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Po&s;&s;ibility being thus &s;ettled, and it being granted that Spirits, or detach'd Angels, do conver&s;e with Mankind vi&s;ibly as well as invi&s;ibly, and have Acce&s;s to us, to our Souls as well as Bo|dies, as well by &s;ecret Communication, as by open and publick Apparition; it remains to enquire into the Manner how this Conver&s;ation is carried on.</P>
<P>I HAVE already entred my Prote&s;t again&s;t all tho&s;e Arts call'd Magical and Diabolic, by which Man is made capable (at lea&s;t) of being Aggre&s;&s;or in this Communication, that he can call up the&s;e Spi|rits, or call 'em down rather, and begin the Con|ver&s;ation when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>WHETHER by Compact and &s;ecret Helli&s;h Familiarity with the <HI>Devil</HI> he may not obtain Leave to u&s;e Satan with &s;uch Freedom, I will not deter|mine; I doubt he may: for the <HI>Devil</HI> may depute &s;uch and &s;uch Powers and Privileges to his Confe|derates, as to his Honour in his great Wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem meet: But that he can empower them to do the like with tho&s;e good and beneficent Spirits of the invi&s;ible World, who are (I have &s;up|pos'd) Spirits, not <HI>Devils,</HI> that I deny, nor do I &s;ee any Rea&s;on to grant it.</P>
<P>I COME then to the Manner the Spirits, which I would &s;uppo&s;e may inhabit the utmo&s;t Wa&s;te, are able to corre&s;pond with us: and fir&s;t, as Spirits

<P>THO' we &s;ee nothing of them, they &s;ee us; tho' we know nothing of them, they know and are con|ver&s;ant about us, are capable of being affected and moved in our Behalf, and to concern them&s;elves for our Good on many Accounts: Hence they often give us Notices and Warnings of Evils attending us, tho' they cannot act &s;o upon material Objects, as to interfere with our Affairs, over-rule our Fate, or direct us how to avoid the Evils which they fore&s;ee, or to embrace the Good which they &s;ee attending us; of which, and the Rea&s;ons of it, I have &s;poken already.</P>

<P>IT will take up too much Room here, to give a full Account of the Travels of this wandring Per&s;on, and how in almo&s;t every Place he found a new Shape ready to thru&s;t into his Company, and that for four Years intimate Ramble; but that at la&s;t, being in <HI>Turkey,</HI> his late&s;t Companion di&s;co|ver'd to him that he was an Inhabitant of an invi&s;i|ble Region, that he had been in his Company in all his Journey in all the differing Figures that he had met with, and that in a Word he was the &s;ame Per&s;on that embark'd with him in <HI>Ireland,</HI> landed with him in <HI>Norway,</HI> left him at <HI>Gottenburg,</HI> found him at <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> dogged him upon the way to <HI>Dantzick,</HI> &s;ailed with him to <HI>Koningsberg,</HI> lent him a Hor&s;e to go to <HI>Riga,</HI> and &s;o on; and that he had only put on &s;o many Shapes and Appearances, that he might not be unea&s;y with him, and tired of his Company.</P>
<P>HOW they went on together after that, and the Conver&s;ation that pa&s;s'd between them after the Di&s;covery; how familiar Friends they were for &s;ome Months after, and what Rea&s;ons he gave why he would never believe that it was a Devil, but a good and kind Spirit &s;ent to take Care of him, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Travels; all that, as foreign to my pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I omit. Perhaps the Story may &s;ee the World by it&s;elf, and well worth reading it will be, if it does. But of that by the by.</P>
<P>AS I do not here enter into the Authority of the Story, (tho', as I &s;aid, I have &s;een it in Manu&s;cript many Years ago) &s;o I have no more to &s;ay from it than this, that if &s;uch good Spirits are conver&s;ant with Mankind, and re&s;ident in the invi&s;ible Spaces, we know not where; if we have rea&s;on to believe they are not Angels, and yet really by their Actions can|not be Devils; then it follows that there are a
<PB N="74" REF="85">
certain middle Species of Spirits in Being; let them be what they will, let them be employ'd, directed, limited and re&s;train'd, how and in what manner he plea&s;es who is their Maker, and who ought to be their Guide and Director; that's not the matter, nor can it be enquired into here; the Que&s;tion before us is only whether &s;uch there are, or no?</P>
<P>NOW if it be granted that there are &s;uch, and that brings it down to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, if there are &s;uch, then all Apparitions are not Devils; no, nor are they walking di&s;turbed Souls of Men lately embodied and departed: a Notion empty and not to be defended; incongruous, and incon&s;i&s;tent either with Scripture, the Chri&s;tian Religion, or Rea&s;on, and founded only in the bewildred Imaginations and Dreams of ignorant People, who neither know how or by what Rules to judge of &s;uch Things, or are capable of right Conceptions about them; who do not give them&s;elves time to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rci&s;e that little Power of thinking that they are Ma&s;ters of, and &s;o are left to the Darkne&s;s of their own Fancies, thinking every thing they &s;ee is a Devil, meerly becau&s;e they know not what el&s;e to make of it, what other Name to give it, or that it can be po&s;&s;ible any thing but Devils or Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ls can come of &s;uch Errands.</P>
<P>BY this Mi&s;take they give the Devil the Ho|nour of many an Action, which he is too much a Devil to have any hand in; a&s;cribe Works of Cha|rity and Benevolence to him; make him move inju|rious and knavi&s;h Men to do Ju&s;tice, Thieves to make Re&s;titution, cruel and inhuman Wretches to be merciful, Cheats to turn hone&s;t, Robbers to de|&s;i&s;t, and Sinners to repent.</P>
<P>STORY tells us, that <HI>Hind</HI> that famous out-law'd Robber, the mo&s;t famous &s;ince <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> met a Spectre upon the Road, in a Place called <HI>Stangate|Hole,</HI> in <HI>Hunti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gton&s;hire,</HI> where he u&s;ed to commit
<PB N="75" REF="86">
his Robberies; and famous for many a Highway Robbery &s;ince that.</P>
<P>THE Spectre appeared in the Habit of a plain Country Grazier; and as the Devil, you may &s;up|po&s;e, knew very well the Haunts and Retreats that this <HI>Hind</HI> u&s;ed to frequent; he comes into the Inn, and taking up his Quarters, puts up his Hor&s;e, and makes the Ho&s;tler carry up his Portmanteau, which was very heavy, into his Chamber; when he was in the Chamber he opens his Pack, takes out his Money, which &s;eemed to be in &s;everal &s;mall Parcels, and puts it together into no more than two Bags, that it might make an equal weight to each &s;ide of his Hor&s;e, and make as much &s;how of it as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>HOUSES that entertain Rogues are &s;eldom with|out Spies to give them due Intelligence; <HI>Hind</HI> gets Notice of the Money, &s;ees the Man, &s;ees the Hor&s;e, that he may know him again; finds out which Way the Countryman travels, meets him at <HI>Stan|gate-Hole,</HI> ju&s;t in the bottom between the two Hills, and &s;tops him, telling him he mu&s;t deliver his Money.</P>
<P>WHEN he nam'd the Money the Grazier feigns him&s;elf &s;urprized, puts on the Pannick, trembles, and is frighted, and with a pitiful Tone &s;ays, <HI>I am</HI> (as you &s;ee) <HI>but a poor Man; indeed, Sir, I have no Money;</HI> [there the Devil &s;hew'd that he could &s;peak Truth when it &s;erv'd his Occa&s;ion.] O you <HI>old Dog,</HI> &s;ays he, have you no Money? Come, open your Cloak-bag, and give me the two Bags, one on one &s;ide your Saddle, and one on t' other: what, have you no Money, and yet your Bags were too heavy to lie all on one &s;ide? Come, come, deliver, or I'll cut you to Pieces this Moment. (There he was out too, and threatened more than he cou'd do.) Well, the poor Devil whines and cries, and tells him he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, he took him for another Man &s;ure, for indeed he had no Money.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="87">
COME, come, &s;ays <HI>Hind,</HI> come along with me; and &s;o he takes his Hor&s;e by the Bridle and leads him out of the Road into the Woods, which are very thick there on both &s;ides, and the bu&s;ine&s;s was too long to &s;tand in the open Road all the while to do it.</P>
<P>WHEN he had gotten into the Woods, Come, Mr. Grazier, &s;ays he, di&s;mount, and give me the two Bags this Minute. In &s;hort he di&s;mounts the poor Man, cuts his Bridle and his Girts, and opens his Cloak-bag, where he finds the two Bags. <HI>Very well,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Hind,</HI> here they are, and heavy as before; &s;o he throws them on the Ground, cuts them open, in one he finds a <HI>Halter,</HI> and in the other a piece of &s;olid Bra&s;s in the exact &s;hape of a Gibbet, and the Countryman behind him call'd to him, <HI>There's your Fate,</HI> HIND, <HI>take care.</HI></P>
<P>IF he was &s;urprized at what he had found in the Bags, (for there was not a Farthing of Money but in the Bag where the Halter was, of which pre|&s;ently,) I &s;ay, if he was &s;urprized at what he found in the Bags, he was more &s;o at hearing the Coun|tryman call him by his Name, and turn'd about to kill him, becau&s;e he thought he was known; but he had no Life nor Soul left in him, when turning about, as I &s;ay, to kill the Fellow, he &s;aw nothing but the poor Hor&s;e. He &s;unk down to the Earth, and lay there a con&s;iderable time; how long, that (being alone) he could not tell, but it mu&s;t be &s;ome Minutes. At la&s;t coming to him&s;elf he goes away terrified to the la&s;t degree, and a&s;hamed, wondring what it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>I HINTED that there was no Money but one Piece found, which the Story &s;ays was <HI>Scots,</HI> a Piece call'd in <HI>Scotland a Fourteen,</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h, a Thirteen Pence Half-Penny,</HI> to pay the Hangman with; from whence it may be &s;uppos'd that Saying is u&s;ed to this
<PB N="77" REF="88">
Day, <HI>that Thirteen Pence Half-Penny is Hangman's Wages.</HI></P>
<P>NOW tho' the Story has &s;ome Mirth in it, and may with the many Stories of that Robber be laid by as Romances, yet it is thus far to my Purpo&s;e; That this was a Spirit, that mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd. A good Angel from Heaven wou'd hardly have been &s;ent to give him &s;uch an ineffectu|al in&s;ignificant Hint, which had no &s;ufficient Effect, whatever it might have ju&s;t then to &s;urprize him, for he rob'd continually after that, and was hang'd at la&s;t for it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Devil,</HI> as before, cannot rationally be &s;u&s;pe|cted in the Ca&s;e; for why &s;hould the <HI>Devil</HI> both bauk him, threaten and caution him? threaten him with hanging him, fright him with the Gibbet and Hal|tar, and caution him to take care. This was not for the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Purpo&s;e, it was more for his Inte|re&s;t to have him go on, though he came to the Gallows at la&s;t.</P>
<P>IF then it was neither <HI>good</HI> Angel or <HI>Bad,</HI> what mu&s;t it be, and how mu&s;t we judge of it? what Name mu&s;t we give him, and who was this Country Graz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er?</P>
<P>TO come off of this, &s;ome will have it be, that it is the <HI>Devil</HI> under Con&s;traint, the <HI>Devil</HI> in Com|mi&s;&s;ion, that he is &s;ent on &s;uch Errands by a &s;upe|rior Power that has him at Command; and that when he is directed to do <HI>&s;o</HI> and <HI>&s;o,</HI> he mu&s;t obey, he dare do no otherwi&s;e. This is begging the Que|&s;tion in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner imaginable. Be&s;ides, why the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;ent of &s;uch Errands?</P>
<P N="1">1. IT <HI>is not probable,</HI> it is not to be gather'd from the ordinary Cour&s;e of Providence. The <HI>Devil</HI> in|deed was permitted, or, if you will have it, he was commi&s;&s;ion'd to &s;trip and afflict Poor <HI>Job;</HI> and he was again permitted to enter into the Herd of Swine; but this does not amount to a Paralel: In
<PB N="78" REF="89">
both tho&s;e Examples he was only employ'd as an In&s;trument, and, as we may expre&s;s it, in his ordi|nary Bu&s;ine&s;s, in the way of his Calling, that is to &s;ay in doing Mi&s;chief: But here he is &s;uppos'd em|ploy'd in doing Good, cautioning a harden'd Rogue to leave off his wicked Cour&s;e, and e&s;cape the Gallows. Now this is quite out of <HI>Satan</HI>'s road of Bu&s;ine&s;s; 'tis al&s;o out of the ordinary cour&s;e of Heaven's Conduct, for when do we find God employing the <HI>Devil</HI> in any good Work? I do not remember one clear Example of it, in all the &s;acred Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT would argue that Heaven &s;hould want In|&s;truments, which is not at all ju&s;t to infer; will they pretend, that, for want of more proper Agents, God &s;hould employ the <HI>Devil</HI> to &s;ave a High-way Man from the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lows? and, which is more than all the re&s;t, &s;hould not bring it to pa&s;s neither? But if you will allow that this was one of the Imaginary &s;pecies of Spirits, who, willing to &s;ave a poor Wretch that was running head long to the <HI>Devil,</HI> took all the&s;e Mea&s;ures to alarm him, and bring him to ju&s;t Reflections, but was not able to reclaim him, was not admitted to give him Notice, when he was about the fatal Act he was &s;urpriz'd in, or to warn him when the Officers came to apprehend him, this &s;eems rational.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould be &s;uppos'd to be employ'd in &s;uch a Work as this was, and &s;o contrary to his Inclination, either he would perform it like him|&s;elf, treacherous and unfaithful, or at be&s;t, reluctant and unwilling. Perhaps you will &s;ay he dur&s;t not perform it treacherou&s;ly and unfaithfully; and it may be not: But why mu&s;t it be &s;uppos'd Heaven &s;hould employ his wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t and wickede&s;t Creature, whom he had long &s;ince disbanded, and ca&s;t out of his Service, rejecting him as unworthy to be em|ploy'd; and who, if he was employ'd, and dur&s;t

<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays one of the Gang,</HI> I'll di&s;patch one of the old Rogues, I'll teach one of them how to make Game at us: upon which, rai&s;ing his Fuzee as high as his Arm would let him, he &s;truck at the antient Man, as he thought it was, with all his Force; but behold! there was nothing in the Chair, and his Fuzee flew into a thou&s;and Pieces, wound|ing his Hand mo&s;t grievou&s;ly, and a Piece of the Barrel &s;triking him on the Head, broke his Face, and knock'd him down backward.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, one of tho&s;e in the <HI>Salon</HI> run|ning at the antient Man that &s;at there, &s;wore he would tear his fine brocaded Gown off, and then he would cut his Throat: but when he went to take hold of him, there was nothing in the Chair.</P>
<P>THIS happening in both Rooms, they were all in mo&s;t horrible Confu&s;ion, and cry'd out in both Rooms at the &s;ame Moment, in a terrible manner.</P>
<P>AS they were in the utmo&s;t Amazement at the thing, &s;o after the fir&s;t Clamour they &s;tood looking upon one another for &s;ome time, without &s;peaking a Word more; but at length one &s;aid, Let's go back into the fir&s;t Parlour and &s;ee if that's gone

too; and with that Word, two or three that were on that &s;ide, run into the Room, and there &s;at the antient Figure as at fir&s;t; upon which they called to the Company, and told them, they believed they were all bewitch'd, and 'twas certain they only fancy'd they &s;aw a Man in the other Rooms, for there was the real old Man &s;itting where he was at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>UPON this they all run thither, &s;aying, they would &s;ee whether it was the <HI>Devil</HI> or no; and one of them &s;aid, Let me come; I'll &s;peak to him; 'tis not the fir&s;t time I have talk'd with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays another,</HI> &s;o will I; and then added with an Oath, Gentlemen that were upon &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s as they were, ought not to be afraid to &s;peak to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>A THIRD (for now their Courage began to ri&s;e again) <HI>calls aloud,</HI> Let it be the <HI>Devil,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Grandmother, I'll parley with it, I am re&s;olv'd I'll know what it is: and with that he runs forward before the re&s;t, and cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, &s;ays to the an|tient Man in the Chair, <HI>in the Name of St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Francis, <HI>and St.</HI>&mdash;(and &s;o reckon'd up two or three Saints Names that he depended were enough to fright the <HI>Devil) What art thou?</HI></P>
<P>THE Figure never mov'd or &s;poke; but looking at its Face, they pre&s;ently found, that in&s;tead of his pitiful Looks, and &s;eeming to beg for his Life, as he did before, he was chang'd into the mo&s;t horrible Mon&s;ter that ever was &s;een, and &s;uch as I cannot de&s;cribe; and that in&s;tead of his Hands held up to them to cry for Mercy, there were two large fiery Daggers, not flaming, but red hot, and pointed with a livid blui&s;h Flame, and in a word, the <HI>Devil</HI> or &s;omething el&s;e, in the mo&s;t frightful Shape that can be imagin'd. And it was my Opinion, when I fir&s;t read the Story, the Rogues were &s;o frighted, that their Imagination afterwards form'd a thing in their Thoughts more terrible than the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf could appear in.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">
BUT be that as it will, his Figure was &s;uch, that when they came up to him, not a Man of them had Courage to look in his Face, much le&s;s talk to him; and he that was &s;o bold, and thus came arm'd with half a Regiment of Saints in his Mouth, fell down flat on the Ground, having fainted away (as they call it) with the Fright.</P>
<P>THE Steward and his three Men were all this while above &s;tairs, in the utmo&s;t Concern at the Danger they were in, and expecting every Moment the Rogues would &s;trive to force their Way up, and cut their Throats; They heard the confus'd Noi&s;e that the Fellows made below, but cou'd not imagine what it was, and much le&s;s the Meaning of it: but while it la&s;ted it came into the Mind of one of the Servants, that as it was certain the Fellows were all in the Parlour, and very bu&s;y there, whatever it was about, he might go up to the Top of the Hou&s;e and throw one of their Hand-Granadoes down the Chimney, and per|haps it might do &s;ome Execution among them.</P>
<P>THE Steward approved of this De&s;ign, only with this Addition; if we throw down but into one Parlour, they will all fly into the Gaming|room, and &s;o it will do no Execution; but, &s;ays he, take three, and put down one into each Chimney, for the Funnels go up all together, and then they will not know which Way to run.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e Orders two of the Men, who ve|ry well knew the Place, went up, and firing the Fuzees of the Granadoes, they put one Shell into each of the Funnels, and down they went roaring in the Chimney with a terrible Noi&s;e, and (which was more than all the re&s;t) they came down into the Parlour where almo&s;t all the Rogues were, ju&s;t at the Moment that the Fellow that &s;poke to the Spectre was frighted into a &s;wooning Fit, and fallen on the Floor.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="99">
THE whole Gang was frighted beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion; &s;ome run back into the gaming Parlour whence they came, and &s;ome run to the other Door which they came in at from the Hall; but all, at the &s;ame In&s;tant, heard the <HI>Devil,</HI> as they thought it was, coming down the Chimney.</P>
<P>HAD it been po&s;&s;ible that the Fuzees of the Gra|nadoes could have continued burning in the Funnel of the Chimnies, where the Sound was a thou&s;and times doubled by the hollow of the Place, and where the Soot burning fell down in Flakes of Fire, the Rogues had been frighted out of their Under|&s;tandings; imagining, that as they had one dreadful <HI>Devil</HI> ju&s;t among them in the Chair, &s;o there were ten thou&s;and more coming down the Chimney to de&s;troy them all; and perhaps to carry them all away.</P>
<P>BUT that could not be; &s;o after they had been &s;ufficiently &s;cared with the Noi&s;e, down came the Shells into the Rooms, all three together: It happen'd as luckily as if it had been contriv'd on purpo&s;e, that the Shell which came down into the Parlour where they all were, bur&s;t as &s;oon as ever it came to the Bottom, &s;o that it did not give them time o much as to think what it might be, much le&s;s to know that it was really a Hand-Granadoe; but as it did great Execution among them, &s;o they as certainly believ'd it was the <HI>Devil,</HI> as they believed the Spectre in the Chair was the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>THE Noi&s;e of the bur&s;ting of the Shell was &s;o &s;udden and &s;o unexpected, that it confounded them, and the Mi&s;chief was al&s;o terrible; the Man that fainted and who lay on the Ground was killed out|right, and two more that &s;tood ju&s;t before the Chimney; five of them were de&s;perately wounded, whereof one had both his Legs broke, and was &s;o de&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rate, that when the People from the Country
<PB N="89" REF="100">
came in, he &s;hot him&s;elf thro' the Head with his own Pi&s;tol, to prevent his being taken.</P>
<P>HAD the re&s;t of them fled out of the Parlour into the two other Rooms, 'tis probable they had been wounded by the other Shells; but as they heard the Noi&s;e in both the outer Rooms, and be|&s;ides were under the Surpri&s;e of its being not a Hand-Granado, but the <HI>Devil,</HI> they had no Power to &s;tir; nor, if they had, could they know which way to go to be &s;afe: &s;o they &s;tood &s;tock &s;till 'till both the Shells in the other Rooms bur&s;t al&s;o; at which be|ing confounded, as well with the Noi&s;e as with the Smoke, and expecting more <HI>Devils</HI> down the Chimney where they &s;tood, they run out all that Way, and made to the Door, helping their wound|ed Men along as well as they could; whereof one died in the Fields after they were got away.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, when they were thus alarmed with they knew not, what coming down the Chimney, they cryed out, that the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Chair had &s;ent for more <HI>Devils</HI> to de&s;troy them; and 'twas &s;uppos'd that had the Shells never come down they would all have run away. But certain it was, that the artificial <HI>Devil</HI> joyning &s;o critically as to Time with the vi&s;ionary <HI>Devils,</HI> or whatever they were, compleated their Di&s;order, and forced them to fly.</P>
<P>WHEN they came to the Door to the two Men, they made &s;ignals for their Comrades, who were po&s;ted in the Avenues to the Hou&s;e, to come to their Relief; who accordingly came up, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted to carry off their Wounded Men: but after hearing the Relation of tho&s;e that had been in the Hou&s;e, and calling a &s;hort Council a little way from the Door, (which, tho' dark as it was, the Steward and his Men could perceive from the Win|dow,) they all re&s;olved to make off.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101">
THERE was another concurring Accident, which tho' it does not relate to my Subject, I mu&s;t &s;et down to compleat the Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That two of the&s;e Granadoes by the Fire of their Fuzes &s;et the Chim|neys on Fire; the third being in a Funnel that had no Soot in it, the Room having not been &s;o much u&s;ed, did not.

<P>HAD the re&s;t of the Gang not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;olv'd to make off, as is &s;aid above, they had certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> fallen into the Hands of the Town&s;men, who ran immediately with what Arms came next to Hand, to the Hou&s;e. But the Rogues were fled, leaving, as above, three of their Company dead in the Hou&s;e, and one in the Field.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, I cannot draw many Inferences to my purpo&s;e from the Particulars of this Story, which however I have told for your Diver&s;ion; but from the General I may; namely, This Apparition was certainly not in favour of the Robbery; and if all the Particulars are true in Fact as related, we can hardly with Ju&s;tice place them to Satan's Account. Take him as a De&s;troyer and a Father of Mi&s;chief, he could not be &s;uppos'd to have appear'd to pre|vent the Robbing the Hou&s;e, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Steward in the Hou&s;e in defence of his Ma&s;ter's Goods: what Good Spirit this mu&s;t be, and from whence, is then a remaining Que&s;tion, and that brings it to my purpo&s;e again.</P>
<P>I SHALL give you another Story out of more Authentick Records, tho' related in a different manner by &s;everal People, as their &s;everal Intere&s;ts inclin'd them.</P>

<HI>JAMES</HI> IV.

This Man was (as it &s;eems by the Story) per|ceived by the King before he came clo&s;e up to him, and before he was &s;een by any of the People; and the King al&s;o perceiv'd him to be earne&s;tly looking at him, and at the Noble Per&s;ons about him, as if de&s;iring to &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome little time he pre&s;s'd thro' the Crowd, and came clo&s;e up to the King, and, with|out any Bow or Reverence made to his Per&s;on, told him with a low Voice, but &s;uch as the King could hear very di&s;tinctly, That he was &s;ent to him to warn him, not to proceed in the War which he had undertaken at the Sollicitation of the Prie&s;ts, and in Favour of the <HI>French;</HI> and that if he did go on with it he &s;hould not pro&s;per.

<P>HAVING deliver'd his Me&s;&s;age he immediately vani&s;h'd; for tho' his pre&s;&s;ing up to the King had put the whole A&s;&s;embly in di&s;order, and that every one's Eye was fix'd upon him, while he was delivering
<PB N="92" REF="103">
his Me&s;&s;age to the King; yet not one could &s;ee him any more, or perceive his going back from the King; which put them all into the utmo&s;t Con|&s;ternation.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf al&s;o was in great Confu&s;ion; he would fain have believ'd the Spectre was a Man, and would have &s;poken to it again, and would have ask'd &s;ome Que&s;tions of him. But the People con|&s;tantly and with one Voice affirm'd that it was an Angel, and that it immediately di&s;appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d after the Me&s;&s;age was deliver'd; that they plainly &s;aw him and felt him thru&s;ting to get by them as he went up, but not one could &s;ee him go back.</P>
<P>THE King upon this was &s;atisfied that 'twas not a real Body, but an Apparition; and it put him into a great Con&s;ternation, and cau&s;ed him to delay his March a-while, and call &s;everal Councils of his No|bility to con&s;ider what to do.</P>
<P>BUT the King being &s;till over-per&s;waded by tho&s;e Engines who were employ'd by Mon|&s;ieur LA MOTTE, the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; con|tinu'd in his De&s;igns for a War, and advanc'd after|wards with his Army to the <HI>Tweed,</HI> which was in tho&s;e times the u&s;ual Boundary of the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P>HERE the Army re&s;ted &s;ome time, and the King being at <HI>Jedburgh,</HI> a known Town in tho&s;e Parts, as he was &s;itting drinking Wine very plen|tifully in a great Hall of the Hou&s;e, where his Head|Quarters was then held, &s;uppos'd to be the old Earl of <HI>Morton</HI>'s Hou&s;e in that Town; the Spectre came to him a &s;econd time, tho' not in the Form which it appear'd in at <HI>Lithgo;</HI> but with le&s;s regard or re|&s;pect to the Prince, and in an imperious Tone told him, he was commanded to warn him not to proceed in that War, which if he did, he &s;hould lo&s;e not the Battel only, but his Crown and Kingdom: and that after this, without &s;taying for any An&s;wer, like the Hand to King <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> it went to the Chimney,

and wrote in the Stone over it, or that which we call the Mantle-piece, the following Di&s;tich,

<P>THESE two Apparitions were certainly from &s;uch Spirits as we are &s;peaking of, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as mean well to Mankind, and being Good and Beneficent in their Nature, would prevent the ruin or de|&s;truction of tho&s;e whom they appear to: But have not always Power to direct the Mea&s;ures, or to oblige the Per&s;ons to hearken to their Advice.</P>
<P>HAD it been a Heavenly Vi&s;ion, 'tis more than probable it would have laid hold of the King's Hand, as the Apparition of Angels did to <HI>Lot,</HI> and as it were dragg'd him away, and &s;aid You &s;hall not go forward, that you may not be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">eated and &s;lain, both you and your Army.</P>

<P>LET us next enquire into the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;turbing or di&s;quieting our departed Friends, with or about the Concerns of their Families: If their coming is by the Permi&s;&s;ion of Providence, then I demand what Occa&s;ion is there for it? and of what Service is it? &s;eeing the &s;ame Providence is able to employ other Servants of the &s;ame Errand, and to do the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s, and who will not only do it as well, but to be &s;ure much better. It is an&s;wer'd, the Sovereignty of Providence is not to be di&s;puted, He may do what he plea&s;es, and em|ploy who he plea&s;es: but then the Wi&s;dom of Providence too is not known to act incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf; and, which is a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to all the re&s;t, we are allowed to judge of all the&s;e things by our rea&s;oning Powers, nor have we any other Rules to judge by; and it can be no Crime to rea|&s;on with calmne&s;s, and with due re&s;pect to &s;uperior Power, upon the ordinary Admini&s;tration even of Heaven it&s;elf.</P>

<P>WHEN the Court thought they had no more Witne&s;&s;es to examine, and the Man in a few Mo|ments would have been acquitted; he gives a Start at the Bar, as if he was frighted; but recovering his Courage a little, he &s;tretches out his Arm to|wards the Place where the Witne&s;&s;es u&s;ually &s;tood

<P>AFTER he recover'd he grew ea&s;ie, and began to forget things again; came over to <HI>Europe</HI> again, and being at <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> he dream'd he &s;aw the murther'd Man again, and that he look'd
<PB N="106" REF="118">
frightful and terrlble; and with a threat'ning A&s;pect, and this threw him into a kind of Me|lancholy, which encreas'd exceedingly; the Spectre, as he call'd it, coming to him every Night.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all; for now as he dreamed of it all Night, &s;o he thought of it all Day; it was, as we &s;ay, before his Eyes continually, his Imagination form'd Figures to him, now of this kind, then of that, always relating to the mur|ther'd Man; &s;o that, in &s;hort, he could think of nothing el&s;e: And tho' he was &s;atisfied there was no real Gho&s;t, as he called it, or Apparition, yet his own terrified Con&s;cience made the Thought be to him like one continued Apparition, and the murther'd Man was never out of his Sight.</P>
<P>HE was &s;o reduced by the con&s;tant Agitation of his Soul, that he was in a very weak Condi|tion, and in a deep Con&s;umption: But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Tumults of his Soul, he had a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Mind, that he could never die in Peace, nor ever go to Heaven, if he did not go over to <HI>England,</HI> and either get the Par|liament's Pardon (for it was in tho&s;e Days when there was no King in <HI>I&s;rael)</HI> or that if he could not obtain a Pardon, that then he &s;hould &s;urrender into the Hands of Ju&s;tice, and &s;atisfy the Law with his Life, which was the Debt he owed to the Blood of the Man he kill'd, and cou'd no other way be expiated.</P>
<P>HE with&s;tood this as a wild di&s;tracted thing, and the Fruit of his di&s;turb'd Mind: What, <HI>&s;aid be to him&s;elf,</HI> &s;hould I go to <HI>England</HI> for? to go there is to GO and DIE; and the&s;e Words, GO and DIE, run daily upon his Mind: But tho' they came fir&s;t into his Thoughts, as an An&s;wer to his other Di&s;tractions, yet they turn'd upon him &s;oon after, and he dream'd that the dead murther'd Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aid to him, GO and DIE; and repeating it &s;aid,
<PB N="107" REF="119">
GO to <HI>England</HI> and DIE; and this follow'd him by Night and by Day, a&s;leep and awak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, that he had it always in his Ears, GO to <HI>England</HI> and DIE.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, and to pa&s;s over &s;ome Cirum&s;tances, tho' worth telling, which happen'd to him in the mean time, he was &s;o continually terrify'd by the Reproaches of his Con&s;cience, and the Voice which he thought follow'd him, that he an&s;wer'd it once in his Sleep thus; Well, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, let me alone, I will GO and DIE.</P>
<P>IT was &s;ome time however before he did; but at la&s;t, unable to &s;upport the Torture of his Mind, he re&s;olv'd to come over to <HI>England,</HI> and did &s;o: He landed at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and there took Pa&s;&s;age in the Tilt-Boat for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he arriv'd at <HI>London,</HI> intending to land at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> he took a Wherry at <HI>Billin&s;gate,</HI> to carry him through Bridge. It happen'd, that two Lighters loaden with Coals run foul of the Boat he was in, and of one another, over-again&s;t <HI>Queen|Hith,</HI> or thereabouts; and the Watermen were &s;o very hard put to it, that they had much ado to a|void being cru&s;h'd between the Lighters, &s;o that they were oblig'd to get into one of the Lighters, and let the Boat &s;ink.</P>
<P>THIS occa&s;ion'd him, contrary to his De&s;ign, to go on Shore a little to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Queen-Hith;</HI> from thence he walk'd up on Foot towards <HI>Cheap|&s;ide,</HI> intending to take a Coach for <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>AS he pa&s;s'd a Street, which cro&s;&s;es out of <HI>Bread-&s;treat</HI> into <HI>Bow-lane,</HI> being almo&s;t Night, and he not well knowing the Streets, having been ab&s;ent eighteen Years, he heard &s;ome body cry, Stop him, &s;top him! It &s;eems a Thief had broke into a Hou&s;e in &s;ome Place, as he pa&s;s'd by, and was di&s;cover'd, and run for it, and the People after him, crying Stop him, Stop him!</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="120">
IT pre&s;ently occurr'd to him, that being &s;o near the Place where the Murther was committed, and where he had lived, &s;ome body that knew him had &s;een him, and that it was him they cry'd after; upon which he began to run with all his Might.</P>
<P>HAD the People cry'd <HI>&s;top Thief,</HI> he had had no need to be alarm'd, knowing, as he &s;aid, that he had &s;tolen nothing; but the Crowd crying only <HI>&s;top him, &s;top him,</HI> it was as likely to be him as not; and his own Guilt concurring, he run, <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>AS he run with all his Might, it was a good while before the People overtook him; but ju&s;t at the Corner of <HI>Soaper-lane,</HI> near about where now &s;tands the <HI>Rummer Tavern,</HI> his Foot &s;lipt, and his Breath failing him too, he fell down.</P>
<P>THE People, not knowing who he was, had lo&s;t their Thief, and pur&s;u'd him; but when they came up to him, they found he was not the right Per&s;on, and began to leave him; but his own Guilty Con&s;cience, which at fir&s;t &s;et him a run|ning, and which alone was his real Pur&s;uer, continu|ing to follow him clo&s;e, and which at la&s;t had thrown him down too, &s;o encreas'd his Fright, that believing they all knew him, he cry'd out, It is very true, I am the Man, it was I did it.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems, when he fir&s;t fell, &s;ome People, who upon hearing the Noi&s;e in the Street came run|ning to their Doors, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es; I &s;ay, &s;ome People, at the Door of a Hou&s;e, ju&s;t again&s;t where he fell, &s;aid one to another, There he is, that's he, they have catch'd him; and it was upon that Saying that he an&s;wer'd, <HI>It is very true, I am the Man, and I did it;</HI> for &s;till he imagin'd they knew him to be the Murtherer, that kill'd the Man &s;o long ago; whereas there was no body there that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ad any Knowledge of the Matter, and the very Memory of the thing was almo&s;t forgotten in the Place, as it might well b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, having been done eigh|teen Years before.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="121">
HOWEVER, when they heard him cry <HI>I am the Man,</HI> and <HI>I did it,</HI> one of the People that came a|bout him &s;aid, What did you do? Why, I kill'd him, &s;ays he; I kill'd Mr.&mdash;and then re|peated his Name; but no body remember'd the Name.</P>
<P>WHY, you are mad, &s;ays one of the People; and then, <HI>added another,</HI> the Man's a di&s;tracted, di&s;order'd Man. They pur&s;u'd a little Shoplifting Thief, and here they have frighted a poor Gentleman, that they own is not the Per&s;on, but is an unhappy di&s;order'd Man, and fancy'd they pur&s;u'd after him.</P>
<P>BUT are you &s;ure he is not the Man?</P>
<P>SURE? &s;ays another; Why, they tell you &s;o them&s;elves. Be&s;ides, the Man is di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>DISTRACTED! <HI>&s;ays a third,</HI> how do you know that?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> he mu&s;t be di&s;tracted, or in Drink; don't you hear how he talks? <HI>I did it, I kill'd him,</HI> and I don't know what. Why, here's no body kill'd, is there? I tell you the poor Man is craz'd. Thus they talk'd a-while, and &s;ome run forward towards <HI>Cheap-&s;ide,</HI> to look for the real Thief, and &s;o they were about to let him go. But one grave Citizen, and wi&s;er than the re&s;t, cry'd, <HI>nay hold,</HI> let's enquire <HI>a little further;</HI> tho' he's not the Thief they look for, <HI>there may be &s;omething in it; let us go before my</HI> Lord Mayor <HI>with him:</HI> and &s;o they did. I think the Lord Mayor then in Being, was Sir <HI>William Turner.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he came before the Lord Mayor, he voluntarily confe&s;s'd the Fact, and was afterwards executed for it: and I had the Sub&s;tance of this Re|lation from an Ear-witne&s;s of the thing, &s;o that I can freely &s;ay that I give entire Credit to it.</P>
<P>IT was remarkable al&s;o, that the Place where this Man fell down when he run, believing he was pur&s;ued and known, tho' at fir&s;t he really was not,
<PB N="110" REF="122">
was ju&s;t again&s;t the very Door of the Hou&s;e where the Per&s;on liv'd that he had murther'd.</P>
<P>MANY Inferences might be drawn from this Story, but that which is particularly to my Pur|po&s;e, is, to &s;hew how Men's Guilt crowds their Ima|gination with &s;udden and &s;urprizing Ideas of things; brings Spectres and Apparitions into their Eyes, when there are really no &s;uch things; forms Gho&s;ts and Phanta&s;ms in their very View, when their Eyes are &s;hut: They &s;ee &s;leeping, and dream waking; the Night is all Vi&s;ion, and the Day all Apparition, 'till either by Penitence or Puni&s;hment they make Satisfaction for the Wrong they have done, and either Ju&s;tice or the injur'd Per&s;on are appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT to bring all this back to our Bu&s;ine&s;s: here's no other Apparation in all this, than what are form'd in the Imagination; the Gho&s;ts, the Souls of the mo&s;t injur'd Per&s;on, whether injuri|ou&s;ly murther'd, or injuriou&s;ly robb'd and plun|der'd, &s;leeps in Peace, knows nothing of the Mur|therer or Thief, except only that it gives that Part all up to the Eternal Judge: the Murtherer has the Horror of the Fact always upon him, Con&s;cience draws the Picture of the Crime in Apparition ju&s;t before him, and the Reflection, not the injur'd Soul, is the Spectre that haunts him: Nor can he need a wor&s;e Tormenter in this Life; whe|ther there is a wor&s;e hereafter, or no, I do not pre|tend to determine. This is certainly <HI>a Worm that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ver dies;</HI> 'tis always gnawing the Vitals, not of the Body, but of the very Soul&mdash;But I &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> here was no Apparition all this while of any kind, no Spectre, no Gho&s;t, no not to detect a Murtherer.</P>
<P N="1">1. NO <HI>Devil</HI> or Evil Spirit; as for <HI>Satan,</HI> he would rather protect, or at lea&s;t &s;helter him, that he might commit another Murther.</P>
<P N="2">2. NO Soul of the decea&s;ed, however injur'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Man acknowledg'd he never &s;aw any real Ap|parition.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="123">
WHAT was it then the Man was exercis'd with? I an&s;wer, he was harra&s;s'd by the Reflection of his own Guilt, and the Sluices of the Soul were &s;et open by the Angels or Spirits attending, and who by Divine Appointment are always at hand to ex|ecute the vindictive Part of Ju&s;tice, as well as the more merciful Di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven, when they have them in Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THESE abandon'd him to the Fury of an en|rag'd Con&s;cience, open'd the Sluices of the Soul, as I call them, and pour'd in a Flood of un&s;ufferable Grief, letting loo&s;e tho&s;e wild Bea&s;ts call'd Pa&s;&s;ions upon him, &s;uch as <HI>Rage, Angui&s;h, Self-reproach,</HI> too late <HI>Repentance,</HI> and final <HI>De&s;peration,</HI> all to fall upon him at once; &s;o the Man runs to Death for Relief, tho' it be to the Gallows, or any where, and that even by the meer Con&s;equence of Things.</P>
<P>BUT if then Oppre&s;&s;ion, Injury, Robbery, and even Murther it &s;elf, will not bring the departed injur'd Soul back in Gho&s;t or Apparition; if when it is once Uncas'd, Di&s;mi&s;s'd, or Unembodied, its State is determin'd, and that it can receive no &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions as to be di&s;quieted afterwards, much le&s;s brought back hither to haunt or perplex the Per&s;ons left behind, what then &s;hall we &s;ay?</P>
<P>HOW then can we think they &s;hould come back for Trifles, namele&s;s Trifles, or Trifles not worth naming? and what are we to call tho&s;e real Appa|ritions which we have Rea&s;on to believe are, and frequently have been &s;een in the World? what are they, nay, what can they be, but the&s;e Angels or Spirits, call them what you will, who inhabit, or have their Station in the great Void or Wa&s;t? who have the Guard, not of our <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> only, nay not of the <HI>Solar Sy&s;tem</HI> only, tho' that is of Immen&s;e and Inconceiveable Extent, and full of di&s;tant Pla|netary Worlds, but even of the whole Sy&s;tem of the Creation, the Sy&s;tem of <HI>Empty Space.</HI></P>

lea&s;t Moment, or give the lea&s;t Interruption to their Felicity; as a poor or mean Man, that having a va&s;t E&s;tate left him in his immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, quits his decay'd out-of-repair Cottage upon the Wa&s;te, and having his Hands full of Gold, or even Bags of Gold, &s;corns to take up the Rags and Rub|bi&s;h of his old dirty Habitation; but &s;ays to his Servants, Let any one take 'em that will, I have enough here.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the rejected and condemn'd Soul, loaded with his own Crime, and &s;inking un|der the Weight of inexpre&s;&s;ible Horror; &s;hall he have any thought about the hated World he came out of! he who abhors and hates the place where he &s;pent a long Life of &s;uch Crime, as now loads him with in&s;upportable Puni&s;hment, is he at lei&s;ure, or in compo&s;ure for concerning him&s;elf in Life any more, where he has already &s;o mi&s;erably ruin'd him|&s;elf, Soul and Body!</P>
<P>IF he was to come back hither for any thing, it would probably be to take the heaps of his ill|gotten Trea&s;ure from the unju&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, his Heir; and making re&s;titution with it to the Poor, whom he had oppre&s;s'd, to the Widows he had robb'd, and in general to all tho&s;e he had injur'd, leave his Family in Poverty and Rags, in&s;tead of their Robes and Velvet; and in Ho&s;pitals and Alms|hou&s;es, rather than Palaces and Parks, and with Coaches or Hor&s;es. Proving the Proverb untrue, and &s;howing that the Son may not be always happy, tho' the Father be gone to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>I DOUBT it would make but &s;ad work among &s;ome Families, who now po&s;&s;e&s;s large E&s;tates; if the Notion &s;ome People entertain about Spirits, and about haunting of Hou&s;es, &s;hould be true: Namely, that the Souls departed could not be at re&s;t 'till Sa|tisfaction was made in &s;uch and &s;uch ca&s;es, where Injury had been done to Orphans and Widows; and
<PB N="118" REF="130">
'till &s;uch Inju&s;tice was prevented as was farther like to be done by their means.</P>
<P>AS to what Re&s;t the Souls of tho&s;e departed would have, I am not to re&s;olve; but I doubt the Souls and Bodies too of tho&s;e that remain, would have &s;mall Re&s;t here, if that were true.</P>
<P>IS it not rather a Proof that the Soul cannot re|turn hither, to do Right to the injur'd race of tho&s;e whom it had oppre&s;s'd with Violence, when embodied, that the Gho&s;t or Soul of&mdash;&s;leeps in its ab&s;ent State, and does not call upon his too happy Heir, and charge him to make reparation in its Name, for all the Ravages and Plunder, out of which he rais'd tho&s;e Millions he left behind? If U&s;ury, Extortion, Perjury and Blood are Injuries that di&s;quiet the Souls unembodied, How is it that the Souls of all the Families, and even Nati|ons of Families oppre&s;s'd and ruin'd by the late&mdash;do not come and do them&s;elves right out of the immen&s;e Wealth, left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e, who, 'till that Ju&s;tice be obtain'd, could have no Claim to it?</P>
<P>BUT to let the Injur'd and the Injurious &s;leep together, as they do, without di&s;turbing or being di&s;turb'd by one another, let us ask a few Que&s;tions of the living? How would a certain wandring Right Honourable, mo&s;t &s;imply elevated Object of human Pity, be terrified at the Apprehen&s;ions of meeting the di&s;honour'd Souls of his Ance&s;tors? and particularly of his pious Grandfather, who would if it were po&s;&s;ible cha&s;ti&s;e him for his Lunacy, and drive him home to the Feet of a merciful Sovereign, to ask Pardon for the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous things that ever humane Rage drove any Man in his Sen&s;es to be guilty of!</P>
<P>IF the Souls of wi&s;e Men could be di&s;quieted for the mad things done by their Po&s;terity, what Regret mu&s;t the Ance&s;tors of all the exil'd Heirs of

<P>IF Souls could return, how &s;hould our Friends the <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI> and <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI> and <HI>S</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI> &s;leep in their Beds, while they enjoy the ruins of &s;o many Fa|milies, and the fortunes of &s;o many Sufferers, who hang'd them&s;elves in De&s;peration for the lo&s;s? and why do they not &s;ee Apparitions every Night from the injur'd Gho&s;ts of&mdash;<HI>L</HI>&mdash;<HI>Ba</HI>&mdash;<HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>Hu</HI>&mdash;and a thou&s;and more; who, could they re|pa&s;s the Gulph, would certainly harra&s;s them, 'till they &s;hould be glad to di&s;mi&s;s them&s;elves the &s;ame way, and run to that Hell which they know no|thing of, from that Hell of Self-reproach, which they would be no longer able to endure?</P>
<P>I COULD de&s;cend to Particulars, 'till I fill'd a Roll too long for your reading; and I know not whether it might not be true, as Sir <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>d</HI> &s;aid in another ca&s;e, that he believ'd all would come up that was under Ground, and his Grandfather would come with the re&s;t and call for his E&s;tate again.</P>
<P>THE Doctrine of di&s;quiet Souls returning hi|ther, to do or obtain Ju&s;tice, to make or demand Re&s;titution, and that they could not be at re&s;t 'till &s;uch and &s;uch things were &s;ettled, Wills perform'd, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Heirs righted, conceal'd Trea&s;ons di&s;co|ver'd, conceal'd Trea&s;ures found out, and the like, were it true, would make the World uninhabitable: Gho&s;ts and Apparitions would walk the Streets at Noon-Day; and the living might go on one &s;ide of the Street, and the dead on the other; the latter would be infinitely more numerous.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="132">
NOTHING can be more propo&s;terous than &s;uch a Notion. It is true, that the examples given, or pretended to be given, of it, are but few, and that very part is again&s;t them; for if the thing is real, why are they but few? It mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd, as the times go, the ca&s;es of the injur'd and oppre&s;s'd are not few: On the contrary, as God &s;aid of the old World, the whole Earth is fill'd with Violence. Whence is it then, if injur'd Souls, or the Souls of injur'd, oppre&s;s'd, ruin'd People could return, that there are not Millions haunting the Doors, nay the Clo&s;ets and Bed-Chambers, of tho&s;e that enjoy the Wealth which was &s;o unju&s;tly obtain'd?</P>
<P>IF it could be at all, the Number would be in|finitely more; for why &s;hould one guilty Soul be unea&s;y, and not another? All the guilty would come back to make Re&s;titution as far as they were able, and all the Sufferers would come back to obtain it.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Condition of tho&s;e that enjoy the ill|gotten Wealth of their Ance&s;tors would be deplo|rable: the Souls of guilty Parents would harra&s;s their Sons for the E&s;tate, to make Re&s;titution; and the Souls of the oppre&s;s'd Sufferers would haunt them, to get their own re&s;tor'd: &s;o that they only would be ea&s;y in the World, who had nothing to re&s;tore, or who enjoyed nothing but what was of their own getting; they only would &s;leep at Night who had ballanc'd with the Day, who had earn'd what they Eat, and had Eaten no more than they earn'd.</P>
<P>BUT this we &s;ee is not the ca&s;e: that the Souls of the mo&s;t guilty remain where they are, and the Souls of the mo&s;t oppre&s;s'd do not come hither to complain, &s;trongly implies, and is to me a &s;ufficient proof, that their State is determin'd; that the Gulph is fixed; that they can only look back with
<PB N="121" REF="133">
Self-Reproach, but cannot come back to give them|&s;elves the Satisfaction of doing Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e they have injur'd; that the murther'd Per&s;on cannot come back, no, not to detect the Murtherer; or the plunder'd Traveller to di&s;cover the Highway|man. It is plain to me, and will pa&s;s for Evidence, that they cannot, becau&s;e they do not; and 'tis plain to me that &s;ome do not, becau&s;e all do not; for if any, why not all?</P>
<P>IT does not con&s;i&s;t with the inlightned Ju&s;tice of that State which we believe is beyond Life, to let one injured Soul come hither to obtain Ju&s;tice a|gain&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;or of his Family, and not let ano|ther have the &s;ame Liberty; or to let one injuri|ous Soul return to make Re&s;titution, and make his Peace, that he may be at Re&s;t, as they call it; and lock up another from it, who would be equally willing to do it, and is equally mi&s;erable in the want of it.</P>
<P>THAT it is not &s;o, is a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony to me that it cannot be &s;o; and the mi&s;erable Con|dition the World would be in here, if it were &s;o, makes it clear to me that the Wi&s;dom of Provi|dence has otherwi&s;e determined it.</P>
<P>NOR would the Advantage be any thing con|&s;iderable, at lea&s;t not in proportion to the Di&s;or|der it would bring along with it; and were we to allow the Po&s;&s;ibility, it would bring in &s;o many Ab&s;urdities with it in Points of Religion, that it would de&s;troy the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Doctrines of all Reli|gion: For Example,</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> We believe that the final E&s;tate of the Soul is determined with Life, and <HI>as the Tree falls &s;o it mu&s;t lie;</HI> that <HI>This is the State of Tryal, That the State of Retribution:</HI> If &s;o then, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould the Souls of the Dead de&s;ire to come back, unle&s;s they were to have a farther Probation, or that there was a Po&s;&s;ibility of retrieving their State,
<PB N="122" REF="134">
and recovering from the Sentence they were under? and if the divine Wi&s;dom had left room for that, it would have as well &s;pared them in Life 'till it had been done.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> To what Purpo&s;e &s;hould the Soul come back to do Ju&s;tice, if doing that Ju&s;tice could make no Alteration of its future State? If it could make any Alteration, then there mu&s;t be room after Death to recover the Soul from eternal Death; and if there was, the Eyes may be &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;o open'd there, that none would omit or neglect it.</P>
<P><HI>THIRDLY,</HI> If coming hither, or doing Ju|&s;tice here, can be no Help to the Souls departed, and yet they de&s;ire it, you mu&s;t then &s;uppo&s;e a &s;trong De&s;ire of doing di&s;intere&s;ted Good may po&s;|&s;e&s;s the Souls of tho&s;e who are in a State of Con|demnation; which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the other Circum&s;tances of Hell, which we have ju&s;t Rea|&s;on to believe &s;huts out all good De&s;ires, and all good Principles, from the Souls that are there.</P>
<P><HI>FOURTHLY,</HI> The Suppo&s;ition of Souls being in a Condition after Death to return hither, de&s;troys all the De&s;criptions which the Scripture gives us of the future Condition, either of the good or bad Souls: but that I hinted before.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, 'tis a Notion, however it may have been received here, perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with either Rea&s;on or reveal'd Religion; and I may venture to &s;ay it cannot be, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, and that all the Pretences of a Gho&s;t or Apparition &s;aying it is &s;uch a Per&s;on, and that it cannot be at Re&s;t 'till &s;o and &s;o be done, and that now it &s;hall go to God, mu&s;t be a Delu&s;ion, and mu&s;t be added by the Per&s;ons relating the Story; for that no Gho&s;t or Spirit really happy could &s;ay &s;o, or would impo&s;e &s;o much upon us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Reality of Apparition farther a&s;&s;erted; and what Spirits they are that do really appear.</HEAD>
<P>THE affirming, as in the foregoing Chapters, that the unembodied Souls of Men do not ap|pear again, or concern them&s;elves in the Affairs of Life; that the Good would not if they could, and the Bad could not if they would; does not at all de|&s;troy the Reality of the thing call'd Apparition, or do I pretend to argue from thence that there is no &s;uch thing as any Apparition at all: on the contra|ry, I in&s;i&s;t it is rea&s;onable to believe (not with&s;tand|ing all that has been &s;aid) that there are &s;uch things as the Apparition of Spirits; and this I think I have already prov'd pa&s;t the Power of any Scruple or Cavil, as al&s;o that there have been &s;uch things in all Ages of the World.</P>
<P>THE Doctrine of the Exi&s;tence of Spirits is e|&s;tabli&s;hed in Nature; where tho&s;e Spirits re&s;ide, is Matter of Difficulty, and our Speculations are va|rious about them; but to argue that therefore there are none, that they exi&s;t not, that there are no &s;uch Beings, is ab&s;urd, and contrary to the Na|ture of the thing; we may as well argue again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of the Sun when it is clouded and eclips'd, tho' we &s;ee its Light, only becau&s;e we cannot &s;ee its Beams, or the Globe of its Body: But let us go back to the Principle.</P>
<P>SPIRIT, <HI>as it is to be con&s;ider'd here,</HI> is to be re|duced to four general Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="136">
<HI>FIRST,</HI> The Author of all <HI>Spirit,</HI> the Fountain of all Being, the Original Cau&s;e of Life, and the Creator both of Spirit and of all the Sub&s;equents of it. This we ju&s;tly adore, as the Infinite Eternal Spi|rit: <HI>GOD is a SPIRIT.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY, Angels</HI> or good Spirits; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re real Spirits, we have Demon&s;tration of it, and they have and do appear daily, as the great Author of all Spirit directs, for the Service of Mankind, for they are <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THIRDLY, Devils</HI> or evil Spirits; the&s;e are really Spirit too, of a &s;pirituous N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ture; 'tis true they are deprived of their Beauty, their Original Glory, becau&s;e depriv'd of their Innocence; they are deform'd as well as defil'd by Crime, but they are not depriv'd of their Nature; they are Spirits &s;till, tho' ca&s;t down and ca&s;t out, and are call'd <HI>wicked Spirits.</HI></P>
<P><HI>FOURTHLY, Souls</HI> of Men, whether good or bad; their Condition may be as you plea&s;e to &s;peak of it, Happy or Unhappy; the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame, it does no way alter their Nature, but &s;till they are <HI>Spirits.</HI> The <HI>Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect;</HI> there's the happy Spirits: <HI>the Spirits in Pri&s;on,</HI> and there's the unhappy; but both are Spirits, and are to be di&s;cours'd of as &s;uch in this Place.</P>
<P>NOW let us bring all this down to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. I have a&s;&s;erted <HI>their Being,</HI> let me en|quire into <HI>their State,</HI> as it re&s;pects our Subject; how far they may or may not, can or cannot ap|pear among Men, in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. How they have vi&s;ited this Earth at &s;everal Times, and on what Occa&s;ions, has been mentioned alrea|dy, and as much at large as the de&s;ign'd Brevity of this Work admits of.</P>
<P>IT remains to enquire what we have to expect of them for the future, and in particular, who we may expect to &s;ee at any time hereafter; which of them may vi&s;it us for the time to come, and which
<PB N="125" REF="137">
may not, or can not be rea&s;onably expected; and this I &s;hall do with the &s;ame Clearne&s;s if po&s;&s;ible, and in very few Words.</P>
<P>OF the four Kinds of Spirit, then, let us con&s;ider the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> GOD, the Soul and Life, the Being of all <HI>Spirit,</HI> has appear'd, as I have &s;aid; but we are to expect him <HI>no more:</HI> I do not &s;ay he can|not appear to us, but I believe I may &s;ay he has determined to ble&s;s the World with no more &s;uch glorious Exhibitions, no more per&s;onal Appear|ances of the Eternal Face, 'till the mo&s;t glorious Appearance &s;poken of in Scripture, <HI>Tit.</HI> ii. 13. <HI>Looking for the ble&s;&s;ed Hope and the glorious appear|ing of the GREAT GOD</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> The di&s;mi&s;s'd, departed, un|embodied Spirits, which we call Souls of Men, whether happy or mi&s;erable, can by no means ap|pear among us; all Apparition of that Kind is ficti|tious and imaginary; never was practicable, except once by Miracle, and never can again be practi|cable, and therefore is not to be expected. We are told indeed, that once, on the extraordinary Occa|&s;ion of the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and to honour that Re&s;urrection with a Miracle of the mo&s;t &s;u|blime Nature, <HI>the Graves were opened, and the Bodies of the Saints aro&s;e and appeared,</HI> &amp;c. The Word is they <HI>Aro&s;e,</HI> and came out of their Graves after his Re|&s;urrection, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxvii. 53. I might enlarge upon the Nature of this Apparition of the Saints which &s;lept; the manner of it, and e&s;pecially the Rea&s;on of it, and &s;hew you how it was really miraculous, and done to convince the doubting Di&s;ciples of the Truth of the Re&s;urrection, which &s;ome of them, being perhaps originaly <HI>Sadduces,</HI> might &s;till que|&s;tion; but my Bu&s;ine&s;s is with an Age not too much delighted in &s;erious Excur&s;ions, &s;o I mu&s;t not make any Tre&s;pa&s;s, however &s;ea&s;onable, or turn grave, however u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="138">
LET it then be &s;ufficient to the Purpo&s;e, this Apparition of Souls was extraordinary and mira|culous, and we are to expect them no more; their State is determined, the happy are too happy, and their Happine&s;s too firmly fix'd, to &s;uffer any &s;uch Interruption; the Unhappy have their Confine|ment too firmly fix'd, to break Pri&s;on, and get out; in a word, the&s;e cannot, and the other would not if they could; and we are not to expect to &s;ee or hear from them any more on this Earth; 'till the Re&s;titution of all things, and 'till they &s;hall be all &s;ummon'd to that grand Appearance, which we believe will one Day happen, whatever our flaming Age pretend to &s;ay to the contrary.</P>
<P>ALL Apparition then of the&s;e two Heads or Species being concluded impo&s;&s;ible in Nature, and not to be expected, we mu&s;t look for it then a|mong the Angelick Spirits; and here indeed it is to be found: Angels of all the Kinds have appear'd, may and do appear, and of them alone are all the Apparitions, which have any Reality in them, form'd.</P>
<P>THIS is bringing the Matter into a narrow Compa&s;s, and putting an end to Cavil and Quar|rel about it; there is no need to wrangle upon it any more; but when you at any time &s;ee an Apparition, or Appearance of Spirit a&s;&s;uming Shape and Voice, and you are &s;ure it is really an Apparition, not a <HI>Deceptio Vi&s;us,</HI> a Cloud, a Va|pour of the Imagination; I &s;ay, whenever you &s;ee &s;uch an Apparition, depend upon it; 'tis an Angel, or a <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE only one Di&s;tinction to make here, which tho' it be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hall be very &s;hort and clear, <HI>viz.</HI> That when I &s;peak of Angels I mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> be under&s;tood as follows,</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> The Word Angel is to be under&s;tood of good Angels; for the <HI>Devils,</HI> as I have &s;aid, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o Angels: Satan is called an Angel of Light
<PB N="127" REF="139">
but the evil Angels I &s;hall always treat with their new Sirname, <HI>Devil;</HI> &s;o that when I &s;peak of An|gels, I am always to be under&s;tood of the good Angels.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> But of good Angels, the&s;e I di|&s;tingui&s;h al&s;o into two Kinds:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THE Angels which are actually in Hea|ven, &s;uch as we read of, <HI>Gabriel, Michael,</HI> and others not di&s;tingui&s;hed by Name; the&s;e have ap|peared among&s;t Men, upon this Earth, as I have al&s;o &s;aid before at large; but even the&s;e, we have Rea&s;on to believe, we &s;hall &s;ee no more; God having plea&s;ed to di&s;cover him&s;elf to his People now in a|nother Way, by another Mini&s;tration, namely, by his Spirit, and by an Evangelick, not an Angelick Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT Rank of Angels or Spirits, call them as we plea&s;e, (and whether inferior or not, we are not to determine,) who are plac'd by the Direction of God him&s;elf in a nearer Situation to us; plac'd, I &s;ay, by their Maker, under his &s;u|perior Providence, for the Direction and Conduct of human Creatures, and of their Affairs, or at lea&s;t to Guard them from the Inva&s;ions, Threatning, and Helli&s;h De&s;igns of the Prince of Darkne&s;s and his Angels; and the&s;e, as I &s;aid, might well be call'd Guardian Angels to the whole Earth.</P>
<P>NOW, the&s;e two &s;orts of Spirit, <HI>viz.</HI> the Guar|dian Angels, the good Spirits detach'd, as I may and did call it, from Heaven, to have the In&s;pection over, and Care of his new Creation, as well here as el&s;ewhere; the&s;e, and the <HI>Devils,</HI> that other &s;ort of Angels, of whom I may have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak (more than a great deal) in this Work; The&s;e, I &s;ay, may, and do appear, and all Apparition is really be|tween them; all Spirit you can &s;peak of, or pretend to &s;ee the Appearance of, mu&s;t be one of the&s;e two, mu&s;t be <HI>Angel</HI> or <HI>Devil,</HI> there is no other, there
<PB N="128" REF="140">
can be no other: Miracle, and &s;omething more than miraculous, and Things which we have no Rea&s;on to look for, only excepted.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, as certain as that no o|ther Spirit does, or can, and as certainly as they do not, or cannot appear; &s;o as certain, and pa&s;t di&s;pute is it, that the&s;e Spirits, both good and bad, do appear to us upon all Occa&s;ions; I mean all Occa&s;ions which they judge needful, and which happens to them, whether by choice or con&s;traint. It is not indeed in us to determine how they are mov'd to go upon the&s;e Errands, or in what man|ner; I may perhaps give &s;ome probable Opinions about the Manner and Cau&s;es both of their Mi&s;&s;ion and Permi&s;&s;ion; for I take tho&s;e two Heads to con|tain the Regulation of their Actings; I &s;ay <HI>Commi&s;|&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and without the&s;e we are &s;ure never to be vi&s;ited in this manner, either by one or other.</P>
<P>IT is true that this gives a con&s;iderable Sanction to the Thing call'd Apparition in general, and makes it appear to be more &s;olemn than we are willing to make it; for by this Rule, neither <HI>De|vil</HI> or <HI>Angel</HI> appears but upon &s;ome extraordinary Occa&s;ion; and if it be &s;o, I do not &s;ee why we &s;hould like it the wor&s;e; for if they were to &s;hew them&s;elves upon every trifling Occa&s;ion, they would either terrifie Mankind &s;o as to make the World intollerable to him, or familiari&s;e them&s;elves &s;o as not to be regarded.</P>
<P>NOW as it would be the <HI>Devil,</HI> not the good Spirits, that would thus haunt the World upon Trifles; (for the other cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to do it) &s;o they would carry on the Familiarity too far, and Men would be &s;o far from being frighted and ter|rified at him, that in &s;hort there would be more Danger in the Intimacy; and, as we &s;ay in another
<PB N="129" REF="141">
Ca&s;e, Mankind and the <HI>Devil</HI> might be too well acquainted.</P>

<P>CHRIST him&s;elf, after his Re&s;urrection, &s;eeing his Di&s;ciples frighted and terrified at his Appearance, takes a great deal of Pains to convince them that he was not a Spirit or an Apparition, as they feared: <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 37. <HI>They were terrified and affrighted, and &s;uppos'd that they had &s;een a Spirit.</HI> This would be what it is too di&s;honourable to &s;ay of the &s;acred Writ, if Apparition of Spirit in the Shape of Bo|dy did never come, and that there were no &s;uch thing in Nature.</P>

<P>SURPRIZ'D with this, and not able to gue&s;s the Meaning of it, he goes away; but the next Morning writes her a very civil obliging Letter, wherein, among abundance of the u&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ions of Lovers, he begs to know what he had done, that &s;hould merit &s;uch Treatment, and that &s;he would let him into &s;o much at lea&s;t of the Cau&s;es of her Di&s;plea&s;ure, as &s;hould put him in a way to clear him&s;elf; prote&s;ting that he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">w not the lea&s;t Step he had taken to di&s;oblige her, except in pun|ctually attending her Appointment; and having the Mortification of &s;itting five Hours by him&s;elf, in Expectation of her Company.</P>

<P>THIS confounded the Doctor for a little while, but he pre&s;ently recover'd him&s;elf; Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I was going to de&s;ire of you, that we might wait upon Mrs.&mdash;together, and that I might hear it from her &s;elf; but upon recollecting all the Cir|cum&s;tances, I am very happy in one thing, namely, that let her &s;ay &s;o her &s;elf, and forty Ladies more, I can prove to you, that it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be true.</P>
<P>THAT will indeed put an End to it all, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman;</HI> but how can you do that?</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="153">
WHY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> are you &s;ure &s;he does not give you a wrong Day?</P>
<P>NO, no, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I have a Rea&s;on why it can't be a Mi&s;take of the Day, for I have a Memorandum of the Day upon a remarkable *  Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P REND="italic">* He had &s;et it down in his Book upon the Occa&s;ion of his being di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>AND it is not the Lady's Mi&s;take then, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor;</HI> for you know Women are not always the exacte&s;t in their Accounts of Days, nor Months, unle&s;s it be on wor&s;e Accounts than I believe you were to meet about.</P>
<P>WELL, Doctor, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> but I am &s;ure of the Day, for I have it in my Book.</P>
<P>NAY, if it was mi&s;taken a Day or two, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> it matters not; for, as I &s;aid before, I never &s;aw her in the Fields in my Life; or if I might &s;ee her among other People, I am &s;ure I never &s;poke to her. But be&s;ides Sir, I tell you, this cannot be true, for I was at <HI>London</HI> all the la&s;t Month 'till the 27th Day, &s;o that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>HERE the Di&s;cour&s;e nece&s;&s;arily broke off: the Gentleman was loth to di&s;cover his Surprize, but told him he would enquire farther into it; and up|on that he goes immediately back to the Lady, re|proaches her a little wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h her forming &s;uch a Story to pick a Quarrel; but not telling her that he had been with the Mini&s;ter at all; only, as he might ea&s;ily know by other Circum&s;tances, that the Do|ctor was out of Town, he told her, that he would not have charg'd her with &s;uch a thing in &s;uch har&s;h Terms, if he was not, upon looking back a little upon things, come to a Certainty, that it was not only fal&s;e, but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to be true.</P>
<P>THEY had a long Dialogue upon that Head; and as he did not pre&s;ently tell her the Circum&s;tances,
<PB N="141" REF="154">
thinking he had a little Advantage upon her, he je&s;ted with her pretty &s;martly upon it, &s;eem'd to laugh that &s;he &s;hould fir&s;t put &s;uch a Sham upon him, and then to tell &s;uch a formal Story to make it good, and to excu&s;e her Breach of Promi&s;e, and that not a Word of Truth &s;hould be in it.</P>
<P>SHE receiv'd his making a Je&s;t of it with Di&s;|dain, and told him &s;he began now to di&s;cover what a kind of a Man &s;he was &s;o near being r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in'd by; and that &s;he had been in good Hands indeed, that could pretend to banter her thus; that &s;he &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ld have been fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly us'd, if the good Mini&s;ter had not been &s;ent from Heaven to &s;ave her from being doubly undone.</P>
<P>HE told her &s;he was &s;oon angry; but it touch'd her home; however Madam, &s;ays he, you &s;han't &s;lander the good Man, for he had no hand in it.</P>
<P>WELL, well, &s;ays &s;he, I can better laugh at you for that Folly, than I &s;hould have done for &s;ome|thing too vile to name, if I had fallen into your Hands: For, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I had too much Rea&s;on to &s;ay now, that I was &s;ure to have been both be|tray'd, and expos'd.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid &s;he grew &s;currilous, and went from one Story to another; that &s;he told him a fal&s;e Story, and wanted to drop it; he de&s;ir'd her to &s;tick to one thing, and go through that fir&s;t.</P>
<P>SHE colour'd, and rai&s;ing her Voice, told him 'twas below a Gentleman to give a Woman the Lie; that &s;he believ'd, if &s;he had been a Man, he dur&s;t not have &s;aid &s;o to her.</P>
<P>HE told her &s;he was mad, and that &s;he had hap|pen'd to &s;peak a fal&s;e thing, and was in a Rage be|cau&s;e &s;he could not come off of it.</P>
<P>SHE told him, he &s;how'd her again that he was no Gentleman; that if he gave her <HI>the Lie</HI> again &s;he would &s;pit in his Face; and that if he would furni&s;h her with a Sword, &s;he would do her &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

ju&s;tice, and give him Satisfaction as fairly as if &s;he was a Man; and that for his giving her the Lie, &s;he threw it back in his Face, he might make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>THAT'S Gallantly done, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Madam in|deed, there's a Sword for you; and offers her his own, laying it down upon the Table before her.</P>
<P>YOU an't even with me yet, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> I &s;corn as much to take up a Sword again&s;t a Naked Man; as you ought to have &s;corn'd, if you had been a Gen|tleman, to give <HI>the Lie</HI> to a Woman.</P>
<P>HE began now to find &s;he was too hard for him; but he came back to the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WELL Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> will you own your &s;elf in the wrong, if I prove to you what I &s;aid ju&s;t now, that what you charge me with not only is fal&s;e, but can't be true?</P>
<P>AY, ay, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what can't be true mu&s;t be fal&s;e; but what does that do for you?</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> will you venture &s;o much upon it as&mdash;</P>
<P>HERE &s;he interrupted him with &s;ome warmth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I'll venture my Life upon it.</P>
<P>NO Madam, not your Life, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you &s;hall only oblige your &s;elf to perform your Promi&s;e, if I do prove it; and I'll promi&s;e never to ask you more, if I do not.</P>
<P>I CAN'T go that length again, to &s;ave Life; but I'll freely con&s;ent to die any Death in the World, that is not by lingring Torture, if you can do it.</P>
<P>WHY then Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you know our Ap|pointment was &s;uch a Day: &s;o he reckon'd up the Days to her, 'till &s;he under&s;tood the Calculation, and agreed that it was &s;o.</P>
<P>WELL, it was &s;uch a Day, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and that Day I &s;aw and talk'd with the Doctor in &s;uch a place.</P>

<P>SHE laught at him at fir&s;t, and told him, that he had been too old for her before; but &s;he was too old for this now: that &s;he might be impo&s;ed upon in many things; but when &s;he &s;aw a Man that &s;he knew, and had known from a Child, and talk'd with a Man &s;he had talk'd to a thou&s;and times, and had heard Preach for almo&s;t fifteen Years, he mu&s;t not think to run her down with Words: that &s;he a&s;&s;ur'd him 'twas &s;o, and there was an end of the thing.</P>

<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I can only &s;ay this, I will have the bottom of it out; for I will not be charg'd as guilty of u&s;ing you ill, while I know nothing of it.</P>

<P>WELL, they parted after this Scuffle, for he was a little daunted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT my Story does not end here; for a little while after &s;omething happen'd that explain'd all the re&s;t: The Lady had a Vi&s;it to pay at a Neigh|bour's Hou&s;e, who liv'd a little out of the Town, only over one little Enclo&s;ure, which &s;he was ob|lig'd to cro&s;s: Now as &s;he was going over that Clo&s;e or Enclo&s;ure, who &s;hould &s;he meet but the Doctor again; and &s;he &s;aw him a good while before he came up to her.</P>
<P>SHE was &s;urpriz'd at &s;eeing him; and if &s;he could have avoided him &s;he would: but 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible. When he came up to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, he pull'd off his Hat very courteou&s;ly, and immediately began to

di&s;cour&s;e of what he had &s;aid to her before; but took no Notice at all of its having been deny'd.</P>
<P>SIR, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have been very ill us'd upon that Day's Work.</P>
<P>I KNOW it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I know it, repeating the Words: But your Innocence &s;hall be cleared up, I will do it my &s;elf; do you be thankful that you e&s;cap'd the Snare: And &s;o, giving her no time to an|&s;wer, he pa&s;s'd by her without taking any farewell: which being a little Particular, made her turn her Head to look at him: But tho' it was in the mid|dle of the Field, which was too large for him to be out of it if he had flown as &s;wift as a Pidgeon, (for it was not above a Moment, not a Second of Time) he was gone, and &s;he &s;aw nothing.</P>
<P>SHE was exceedingly &s;urpriz'd, and ready to &s;ink into the Ground; &s;he was &s;o frighted that &s;he could not help fitting down even upon the Gra&s;s; for her Joints trembled under her, &s;o that &s;he could not &s;tand.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that a poor Woman of the Town came cro&s;s the Clo&s;e at the very juncture, and knowing her, &s;he call'd to her to come and help her up. She did not tell the Woman what had hap|pen'd to her, but that &s;he was taken with a fit of trembling, and that if &s;he had not &s;at down &s;he mu&s;t have fallen down; all which was true: &s;o the poor Woman help'd her up, and led her home, where &s;he continued very ill of the Fright for &s;e|veral Days.</P>
<P>IN this time &s;he had a very great de&s;ire to &s;ee the Gentleman, for by what the Apparition &s;aid to her &s;he made no doubt but he had &s;een it too.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time he had heard that &s;he was very ill, and thinking what he had &s;aid to her might have had &s;ome influence upon her, to hurt her, he re&s;olv'd to go and &s;ee her; for tho' he had ruffled her pretty much; yet, as he &s;aid afterwards,

he lov'd her very well; and the better for her &s;o &s;ea&s;onably recovering her Vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ue and good Princi|ples; and much better than he believ'd he &s;hould have done, if he had had his Will of her, as he &s;hould certainly have had, if &s;he had met him that time at the Farmer's.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e kind Thoughts h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> went to vi&s;it her; and tho' &s;he was very ill, yet &s;he would be brought out of her Chamber to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome Civilities, he frankly told her the rea&s;on of his Vi&s;it word for word as above, and that he came to chear her up a little.</P>
<P>SHE thank'd him; but told him it was true it had extremely troubled her, to think fir&s;t how near &s;he had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en to her utter Ruin, and then how needle&s;ly &s;he had been expos'd for it; and that tho' &s;he had no Guilt, as he very well knew, other than that which was in the fir&s;t wicked Con&s;enting; yet &s;he had been as much expos'd, as if &s;he had been really his Whore.</P>
<P>HE prote&s;ted to her that he never had opened his Lips of it to the Doctor, or any one el&s;e; and that it was the Re&s;entment at the charging him with it, that had made him &s;o angry, and nothing el&s;e; for that he &s;corn'd any thing &s;o ba&s;e.</P>
<P>SHE told him it was impo&s;&s;ible for any one to believe otherwi&s;e before; but that &s;he believ'd he was &s;atisfied how it all was, now; and that &s;ome|thing had happen'd &s;ince, which had open'd her Eyes, tho' it had almo&s;t kill'd her; and &s;he believ'd he knew &s;omething of it too.</P>

<P><HI>SHE &s;aid,</HI> &s;he could not tell him, becau&s;e &s;he &s;uppos'd he would not believe her.</P>

<P><PB N="150" REF="163">

<P>HE importun'd her earne&s;tly to let him know what it was; and that with &s;uch a &s;erious kind of Di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he fancy'd he had &s;een &s;omething too; but it &s;eems he had not: However he en|treated her &s;o much, that at la&s;t &s;he let him know the whole Story, as above.</P>
<P>THER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> is a great deal more belongs to this Story, which would be very diverting, and not without its U&s;es too; but as the particular Rela|tion does not come within the verge of my own Knowledge, I cannot vouch all the Particulars, at lea&s;t not &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, 'tis enough to the Ca&s;e in hand: If the Apparition came to prevent this poor de|luded young Lady from pro&s;tituting her &s;elf to a Man that had wheedled her in upon &s;uch di&s;honou|rable Terms; it could not certainly be the <HI>Devil,</HI> or any Spirit of his Cla&s;s, or under his Govern|ment and Direction; he would never have exhorted her to go back, reproach'd her with the Crime, and prevail'd upon her to believe it had been re|veal'd to him by the Treachery of her Lover.</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t be certainly one of tho&s;e Angelick Guards which the God of Nature, in Mercy to Mankind, has placed as a detach'd Body of Spirits to counter-act the <HI>Devil,</HI> prevent the Arch-ene|my &s;educing his Creatures, and over-whelming the World with Crime; and if the Story be as I have receiv'd it and now handed it down, it &s;eems a merciful Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence in Favour of the Gentleman, as well as the Lady; and be it a Pa|rable or a Hi&s;tory, the Moral is the &s;ame, and the Improvement of it the &s;ame too: They that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">unning the &s;ame Cour&s;e of Folly would have Rea&s;on
<PB N="151" REF="164">
to be very thankful if they were &s;ure to meet with the &s;ame kind of Di&s;appointment, and would never &s;ay it was the <HI>Devil</HI> that told it them.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman it &s;eems did not &s;light the Story &s;o much as &s;he expected he would, nor did he que&s;tion the Truth of any or every Part of it; for &s;he told it with &s;o much Steadine&s;s, always a|greeing in every Particular, and gave &s;o concur|ring Accounts of the Circum&s;tances as they related to what had happened before, that it was appa|rent 'twas no Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THAT which made him mo&s;t unea&s;y, was that the Apparition &s;eem'd to promi&s;e to appear to him; and he had no De&s;ire to be convinc'd that way. Indeed the Story, at lea&s;t &s;o far as I have the Particulars, breaks off a little abruptly there and does not &s;ay whether he ever &s;aw any thing or no. But it &s;aid, it made him be quite another Man in his Way of living than ever he was before; and particularly he was very thankful that he had been prevented being &s;o wicked with her as in all Pro|bability he had been, if this had not happen'd.</P>
<P>NOW this Apparition, as is &s;aid above, could not with any manner of Rea&s;on, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Devil;</HI> for why &s;hould an <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> appear, to keep any Per&s;on from doing Evil? Why &s;hould it a&s;&s;ume a real Shape, namely that of a Mini&s;ter in his Gown and Ca&s;&s;ock, and that it was in Appearance the very Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h; for all this &s;he con|&s;tantly affirm'd, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o things are natural Infe|rences from it.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> That the Appearance was real.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> That it was a good Spirit.</P>
<P>LET the Divines read us Lectures upon the Nature of Spirits, and upon how far they can or cannot take Cognizance of human Affairs; That I have nothing to do with here; my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to ob&s;erve the Matter of Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> that they do come
<PB N="152" REF="165">
hither, do appear, and are &s;een, talk'd to and con|vers'd with, and that they do come on good Errands, and therefore are not likely to be evil Spirits or <HI>Devils.</HI></P>
<P>TAKE another Hi&s;torical Relation, which, tho' I name no Names, I have very good Authority for the Truth of, and that more particularly than for the other.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN of a very good E&s;tate mar|ried a Lady of al&s;o a good Fortune, and had one Son by her, and one Daughter, and no more, and after a few Years his Lady died. He &s;oon married a &s;econd Venter; and his &s;econd Wife, tho' of an inferior Qua|lity and Fortune to the former, took upon her to di&s;|courage and di&s;countenance his Children by his fir&s;t Lady, and made the Family very uncomfortable, both to the Children and to their Father al&s;o.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing of Con&s;equence which this Con|duct of the Mother-in-Law produced in the Family, was that the Son, who began to be a Man, ask'd the Father's Leave to go abroad to travel. The Mother|in-Law, tho' willing enough to be rid of the young Man, yet becau&s;e it would require &s;omething con|&s;iderable to &s;upport his Expences abroad, violently oppos'd it, and brought his Father al&s;o to refu&s;e him, after he had freely given him his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>THIS &s;o affected the young Gentleman, that after u&s;ing all the dutiful Applications to his Father that he could po&s;&s;ibly do, as well by him&s;elf as by &s;ome other Relations, but to no purpo&s;e; and being a little encouraged by an Uncle, who was Brother to his Mother, his Father's fir&s;t Lady, he re&s;olv'd to go abroad without Leave, and accordingly did &s;o.</P>
<P>WHAT Part of the World he travelled into I do not remember; it &s;eems his Father had con|&s;tantly Intelligence from him for &s;ome time, and was prevail'd with to make him a rea&s;onable Allowance
<PB N="153" REF="166">
for his Sub&s;i&s;tance, which the young Gentleman always drew Bills for, and they were honourably paid; but after &s;ome time, the Mother|in-Law prevailing at home, one of his Bills of Exchange was refus'd, and being prote&s;ted, was &s;ent back without Acceptance; upon which he drew no more, nor did he write any more Letters, or his Father hear any thing from him for upwards of four Years, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>UPON this long Silence, the Mother-in-Law made her Advantage &s;everal Ways; &s;he fir&s;t intima|ted to his Father that he mu&s;t needs be dead; and con&s;equently, his E&s;tate &s;hould be &s;ettled upon her elde&s;t Son, (for &s;he had &s;everal Children.) His Fa|ther with&s;tood the Motion very firmly, but the Wife harr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s'd him with her Importunities; and &s;he argued upon two Points again&s;t him, I mean the Son.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> If he was dead, then there was no room to object, her Son being Heir at Law.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> If he was not dead, his Beha|viour to his Father in not writing for &s;o long a Time was inexcu&s;able, and he ought to re&s;ent it, and &s;ettle the E&s;tate as if he were dead; that no|thing could be more di&s;obliging, and his Father ought to depend upon it that he was dead, and treat him as if he was &s;o; for he that would u&s;e a Father &s;o, &s;hould be taken for one dead, as to his filial Relation, and be treated accordingly.</P>
<P>HIS Father however &s;tood out a long time, and told her that he could not an&s;wer it to his Con|&s;cience; that there might happen many things in the World, which might render his Son unable to write; that he might be taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and carried into Slavery; or he migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> be among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> or <HI>Arabians</HI> (which it &s;eems was the Cafe) and &s;o could not get any Letters convey'd; and that he could not be &s;atisfied to di&s;inherit him,
<PB N="154" REF="167">
'till he knew whether he had Rea&s;on for it or no, or whether his Son had offended him or no.</P>
<P>THESE An&s;wers, however ju&s;t, were far from &s;topping her Importunities, which &s;he carried on &s;o far, that &s;he gave him no Re&s;t, and it made an unquiet Family; &s;he carried it very ill to him, and in a word, made her Children do &s;o too; and the Gentleman was &s;o wearied out with it, that once or twice he came to a kind of Con&s;ent to do it, but his Heart fail'd him, and then he fell back again, and refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, her having brought him &s;o near it, was an Encouragement to her to go on with her re&s;tle&s;s Sollicitations, 'till at la&s;t he came thus far to a provi&s;ional Agreement, that if he did not hear from his Son by &s;uch a time, or before it, he would con&s;ent to a re-&s;ettling the E&s;tate.</P>
<P>SHE was not well &s;atisfied with the conditional Agreement, but being able to obtain no other, &s;he was oblig'd to accept of it as 'twas; tho', as &s;he often told him, &s;he was far from being &s;atisfied with it as to the Time, for he had fix'd it for four Years, as above.</P>
<P>HE grew angry at her telling him &s;o, and an|&s;wer'd, that &s;he ought to be very well &s;atisfied with it, for that it was time little enough, as his Son's Circum&s;tances might be.</P>
<P>WELL, &s;he teiz'd him however &s;o continually, that at la&s;t &s;he brought him down to one Year: But before &s;he brought him to that, &s;he told him one Day in a Heat, that &s;he hoped his Gho&s;t would one time or other appear to him, and tell him, that he was dead, and that he ought to do Ju&s;tice to his other Children, for he &s;hould never come to claim the E&s;tate.</P>
<P>WHEN he came, &s;o much again&s;t his Will, to con&s;ent to &s;horten the time to one Year, he told her, that he hoped his Son's Gho&s;t, tho' he was
<PB N="155" REF="168">
not dead, would come to her, and tell her he was alive, before the Time expired: For why, &s;ays he, may not injur'd Souls walk while embodied, as well as afterwards?</P>
<P>IT happen'd one Evening after this, that they had a mo&s;t violent Family Quarrel upon this Sub|ject, when on a &s;udden a Hand appeared at a Ca&s;e|ment, endeavouring to open it; but as all the iron Ca&s;ements, u&s;ed in former Times, open'd outward, but ha&s;p'd or fa&s;ten'd them&s;elves in the In&s;ide; &s;o the Hand &s;eem'd to try to open the Ca&s;ement, but could not. The Gentleman did not &s;ee it, but his Wife did, and &s;he pre&s;ently &s;tarted up, as if &s;he was frighted, and forgetting the Quarrel they had upon their Hands, Lord ble&s;s me! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> there are Thieves in the Garden. Her Husband ran im|mediately to the Door of the Room they &s;at in, and opening it, look'd out.</P>
<P>THERE'S no body in the Garden, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> &s;o he clapt the Door again, and came back.</P>
<P>I AM &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I &s;aw a Man there.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be the <HI>Devil</HI> then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for I'm &s;ure there's no body in the Garden.</P>
<P>I'LL &s;wear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I &s;aw a Man put his Hand up to open the Ca&s;ement; but finding it fa&s;t, and I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>adds &s;he,</HI> &s;eeing us in the Room, he walk'd off.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible he could be gone, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> did not I run to the Door immediately? and you know the Garden Walls on both &s;ides hinder him going</P>
<P>PRY'THEE, <HI>&s;ays &s;he angrily,</HI> I an't drunk nor in a Dream, I know a Man when I &s;ee him, and 'tis not dark, the Sun is not quite down.</P>
<P>YOU'RE only frighted with Shadows, <HI>&s;ays he, very full of Ill-nature:</HI> Folks generally are &s;o that are haunted with an evil Con&s;cience: it may be 'twas the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="169">
NO, no, I'm not &s;oon frighted, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> if 'twas the <HI>Devil,</HI> 'twas the Gho&s;t of your Son: it may be come to tell you he was gone to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and you might give your E&s;tate to your elde&s;t Ba&s;tard, &s;ince you won't &s;ettle it on the lawful Heir.</P>
<P>IF it was my Son, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> he's come to tell us he's alive, I warrant you, and to ask you how you can be &s;o much a <HI>Devil</HI> to de&s;ire me to di&s;inhe|rit him; and with tho&s;e Words, <HI>Alexander, &s;ays he aloud,</HI> repeating it twice, &s;tarting up out of his Chair, if you are alive &s;how your &s;elf, and don't let me be in&s;ulted thus every Day with your being dead.</P>
<P>AT tho&s;e very Words, the Ca&s;ement which the Hand had been &s;een at by the Mother, open'd of it&s;elf, and his Son <HI>Alexander</HI> look'd in with a full Face, and &s;taring directly upon the Mother with an angry Countenance, cry'd <HI>Here,</HI> and then va|ni&s;h'd in a Moment.</P>
<P>THE Woman that was &s;o &s;tout before, &s;hriek'd out in a mo&s;t di&s;mal manner, &s;o as alarm'd the whole Hou&s;e; her Maid ran into the Parlour, to &s;ee what was the matter, but her Mi&s;tre&s;s was fainted away in her Chair.</P>
<P>SHE was not fallen upon the Ground, becau&s;e it being a great ea&s;ie Chair, &s;he &s;unk a little back again&s;t the &s;ide of the Chair, and Help coming im|mediately in, they kept her up; but it was not 'till a great while after, that &s;he recover'd enough to be &s;en&s;ible of any thing.</P>
<P>HER Husband run immediately to the Parlour Door, and opening it went into the Garden, but there was nothing; and after that he run to another Door that open'd from the Hou&s;e into the Garden, and then to two other Doors which open'd out of his Garden, one into the Stable-yard, and ano|ther into the Field beyond the Garden, but found
<PB N="157" REF="170">
them all fa&s;t &s;hut and barr'd; but on one &s;ide was his Gardener, and a Boy, drawing the Rolling|&s;tone: he ask'd them if any body el&s;e had been in the Garden, but they both con&s;tantly affirmed no body had been there, and they were both rolling a Gravel-walk near the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON this he comes back into the Room, &s;its him down again, and &s;aid not one Word for a good while; the Women and Servants being bu&s;y all the while, and in a Hurry, endeavouring to recover his Wife.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time &s;he recover'd &s;o far as to &s;peak, and the fir&s;t Words &s;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>L&mdash;d ble&s;s me! what was it?</P>
<P>NAY, &s;ays her Husband, 'twas <HI>Alexander</HI> to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>WITH that &s;he &s;ell into a Fit, and skream'd and &s;hriek'd out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gain mo&s;t terribly.</P>
<P>HER Husband not thinking that would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ffected her, did what he could to per&s;uade her out of it again; but that would not do, and they were oblig'd to carry her to Bed, and get &s;ome help to her; but &s;he continued very ill for &s;everal Days after.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this put an end for &s;ome con&s;ide|rable time to her Sollicitations about his Di&s;inhe|riting her Son-in-Law.</P>
<P>BUT Time, that hardens the Mind in ca&s;es of a wor&s;e Nature, wore this off al&s;o by degrees, and &s;he began to revive the old Cau&s;e again, tho' not at fir&s;t &s;o eagerly as before.</P>
<P>NAY he us'd her a little hardly upon ittoo, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f ever th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y had any Words about it he would bid her hold her Tongue, or that if &s;he talked any more upon that Subject, he would call <HI>Alexand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> again to open the Ca&s;ement.</P>
<P>THIS aggravated Things much; and tho' it ter|rify'd her a great while, yet at length &s;he was &s;o
<PB N="158" REF="171">
exa&s;perated, that &s;he told him &s;he believ'd he dealt with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and that he had &s;old him&s;elf to the <HI>Devil</HI> only to be able to fright his Wife.</P>
<P>HE je&s;ted with her, and told her any Man wou'd be beholden to the <HI>Devil</HI> to hu&s;h a noi&s;y Wo|man, and that he was very glad he had found the Way to do it, whatever it co&s;t him.</P>
<P>SHE was &s;o exa&s;perated at this, that &s;he threa|ten'd him if he play'd any more of his helli&s;h Arts with her, &s;he wou'd have him Indicted for a Wi|zard, and having a Familiar; and &s;he could prove it, &s;he &s;aid, plain enough, for that he had rais'd the <HI>Devil</HI> on purpo&s;e to fright his Wife.</P>
<P>THE Fray parted that Night with ill Words and ill Nature enough, but he little thought &s;he intended as &s;he &s;aid, and the next Day he had for|got it all, and was as good-humour'd as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>BUT he found his Wife chagreen'd and di&s;tur|bed very much, full of Re&s;entment, and threatning him with what &s;he re&s;olv'd to do.</P>
<P>HOWEVER he little thought &s;he intended him the Mi&s;chief &s;he had in her Head, offering to talk friendly to her; but &s;he rejected it with Scorn, and told him &s;he would be as good as her Word, for &s;he wou'd not live with a Man that &s;hould bring the <HI>Devil</HI> into the Room as often as he thought fit, to murther his Wife.</P>
<P>HE &s;trove to pacify her by fair Words, but &s;he told him &s;he was in earne&s;t with him: and in a Word &s;he was in earne&s;t; for &s;he goes away to a Ju&s;tice, and making an Affidavit that her Hu&s;|band had a Familiar Spirit, and that &s;he went in Danger of her Life, &s;he obtain'd a Warrant for him to be apprehended.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, &s;he brought home the Warrant, &s;hew'd it him, and told him &s;he had not given it into the Hands of an Officer, becau&s;e he &s;hould have
<PB N="159" REF="172">
the Liberty to go voluntarily before the Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and if he thought fit to let her know when he would be ready, &s;he would be &s;o too, and would get &s;ome of her own Friends to go along with her.</P>
<P>HE was &s;urpriz'd at this, for he little thought &s;he had been in earne&s;t with him and endeavour'd to pacify her by all the Ways po&s;&s;ible; but &s;he found &s;he had frighted him heartily, and &s;o indeed &s;he had, for tho' the thing had nothing in it of Guilt, yet he found it might expo&s;e him very much, and being loth to have &s;uch a Thing brought upon the Stage again&s;t him, he u&s;ed all the Entreaties with her that he was able, and begged her not to do it.</P>
<P>BUT the more he humbled him&s;elf, the more &s;he triumph'd over him; and carrying Things to an un&s;ufferable height of In&s;olence, &s;he told him at la&s;t &s;he would make him do Ju&s;tice, as &s;he call'd it; that &s;he was &s;ure &s;he cou'd have him puni&s;h'd if he continu'd ob&s;tinate, and &s;he wou'd not be expos'd to Witchcraft and Sorc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ry; for &s;he did not know to what length he might carry it.</P>
<P>TO bring the Story to a Conclu&s;ion; &s;he got the better of him to &s;uch a degree, that he offer'd to refer the thing to indifferent Per&s;ons, Friends on both Sides; and they met &s;everal Times, but could bring it to no Conclu&s;ion. His Friends &s;aid there was nothing in it, and they would not have him comply with any thing upon the Pre|tence of it; that he called for his Son, and &s;ome body open'd the Ca&s;ement and cry'd <HI>here;</HI> that there was not the lea&s;t Evidence of Witchcraft in that, and in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he cou'd make nothing of it.</P>
<P>HER Friends carried it high, in&s;tructed by her: She offer'd to &s;wear that he had threatned her be|fore with his Son's Gho&s;t; that now he vi&s;ibly rais'd
<PB N="160" REF="173">
a Spectre; for that calling upon his Son, who was dead to be &s;ure, the Gho&s;t immediately appear'd; that he could not have called up the <HI>Devil</HI> thus to per&s;onate his Son, if he had not dealt with the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, and had a familiar Spirit, and that this was of dangerous Con&s;equence to her.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the Man wanted Courage to &s;tand it, and was afraid of being expos'd; &s;o that he was grievou&s;ly perplex'd, and knew not what to do.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he found him humbled as much as &s;he cou'd de&s;ire, &s;he told him if he would do her Ju|&s;tice, as &s;he call'd it, (that is to &s;ay, &s;ettle his E&s;tate upon her Son,) &s;he would put it up, on Condition that he &s;hould promi&s;e to fright her no more with rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>THAT part of the Propo&s;al exa&s;perated him again, and he upbraided her with the Slander of it, and told her he defy'd her, and &s;he might do her wor&s;t.</P>
<P>THUS it broke off all Treaty, and &s;he began to threaten him again; however, at length, &s;he brought him to comply, and he gives a Writing under his Hand to her, &s;ome of her Friends being by, promi&s;ing that he would comply if his Son did not arrive, or &s;end an Account of him&s;elf, with|in four Months.</P>
<P>SHE was &s;atisfy'd with this, and they were all made Friends again, and accordingly he gave the Writing; but when he deliver'd it to her in Pre|&s;ence of her two Arbitrators, he took the Liberty to &s;ay to her, with a grave and &s;olemn kind of Speech:</P>
<P>LOOK you, &s;ays he, you have worry'd me into this Agreement by your fiery Temper, and I have &s;ign'd it again&s;t Ju&s;tice, Con&s;cience and Rea&s;on; but depend upon it, I &s;hall never perform it.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174">
ONE of the Arbitrators &s;aid, Why, Sir, this is doing nothing; for if you re&s;olve not to perform it, what &s;ignifies the Writing? Why do you promi&s;e what you do not intend &s;hall be done? This will but kindle a new Flame to begin with, when the Time fix'd expires.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I am &s;atisfy'd in my Mind that my Son is alive.</P>
<P>COME, come, <HI>&s;ays his Wife,</HI> &s;peaking to the Gen|tleman that had argued with her Husband, let him &s;ign the Agreement, and let me alone to make him perform the Conditions.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays her Husband,</HI> you &s;hall have the Writing, and you &s;hall be let alone; but I am &s;a|tisfy'd you will never ask me to perform it; and yet I am no Wizard, adds he, as you have wick|edly &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>SHE reply'd that &s;he would prove that he dealt with the <HI>Devil,</HI> for that he rais'd an evil Spirit by only calling his Son by his Name; and &s;o began to tell the Story of the Hand and the Ca&s;ement.</P>
<P>COME, &s;ays the Man to the Gentleman that was her Friend, give me the Pen; I never dealt with but one <HI>Devil</HI> in my Life, and there it &s;its, turning to his Wife; and now I have made an Agreement with her, that none but the <HI>Devil</HI> wou'd de&s;ire any Man to &s;ign: and I will &s;ign it; I &s;ay, give me the Pen, but &s;he nor all the <HI>Devils</HI> in Hell will ever be able to get it executed, remem|ber I &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>SHE began to open at him, and &s;o a new Flame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have been kindled, but the Gentlemen mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erated between them; and her Husband &s;etting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is Hand to the Writing put an end to the Fray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t that time.</P>
<P>AT the end of four Months &s;he challeng'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erformance, and a Day was appointed, and her two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">riends that had been the Arbitrators were invited

People, and be Invi&s;ible to others, tho' all in the &s;ame Room together.</P>

<P>AND what do you think of it your&s;elf, <HI>&s;ays the Arbitrator,</HI> do you think he is dead?</P>
<P>NO, indeed, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> I do believe in my Con&s;cience he is alive, as much as I believe I am alive my&s;elf; and I am going to do as wicked a thing of its Kind as ever any Man did.</P>

<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t Arbitrator,</HI> I think we meet now not to enquire into why it is done, but to execute Things according to Agreement, and what are we frighted at?</P>

<PB N="165" REF="178">
the Room; and with that &s;he takes up one of the Deeds, and went to tear off the Seal.</P>
<P>THAT Moment the &s;ame Ca&s;ement flew open again, tho' it was fa&s;t in the In&s;ide, ju&s;t as it was before; and the Shadow of a Body was &s;een, as &s;tanding in the Garden without, and the Head reaching up to the Ca&s;ement, the Face looking into the Room, and &s;taring directly at the Woman with a &s;tern and an angry Counte|nonce; HOLD, &s;aid the Spectre, as if &s;peaking to the Woman; and immediately clap'd the Ca&s;ement to again, and vani&s;h'd.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe here the Con&s;ter|nation this &s;econd Apparition put the whole Com|pany into; the Wife, who was &s;o bold ju&s;t before, that &s;he wou'd do it tho' forty <HI>Devils</HI> were in the Room, skream'd out like a Woman in Fits, and let the Writing fall out of her Hands: The two Arbitrators were exceedingly terrify'd, but not &s;o much as the re&s;t; but one of them took up the Award which they had &s;ign'd, in which they awar|ded the Husband to execute the Deed to di&s;po&s;e of the E&s;tate from the Son.</P>
<P>I DARE &s;ay, &s;aid he, be the Spirit a good Spi|rit or a bad, it will not be again&s;t cancelling this; &s;o he tore his Name out of the Award, and &s;o did the other, by his Example, and both of them got up from their Seats, and &s;aid they would have no more to do in it.</P>
<P>BUT that which was mo&s;t unexpected of all was, that the Man him&s;elf was &s;o frighted, that he fainted away; notwith&s;tanding it was, as it might be &s;aid, in his favour.</P>
<P>THIS put an end to the whole Affair at that time; and, as I under&s;tand by the Sequel, it did &s;o for ever.</P>

<P>I SHALL bring one Example now within my own Knowledge, and in which I had &s;ome Concern;

<P>THIS Caution of mine, however, ought not to le&s;&s;en the Credit of any of the Relations here pub|li&s;h'd; for why may not the Account given by a|nother Hand be as true as this which I give you from my own Knowledge; and why mu&s;t an Au|thor, in &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e, be made an&s;wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ble for the Particulars of every Hi&s;tory, or be bound to leave it out, which would be the Reader's Lo&s;s, not his own.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the following I can vouch from my own Knowledge. <HI>A. B.</HI> was a Merchant in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and as he drove a con&s;iderable Trade beyond|&s;ea, he e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Factor, or as the Language of Trade calls it a HOUSE, at a certain Port in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and &s;ent over his Ser|vants or Apprentices thither, as is u&s;ual for Mer|chants to do.</P>
<P>ONE of his &s;aid Apprentices being fitted out, and ready to Embark, his Cargo being actua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly on board the Ship, and the Ship fallen down the Ri|ver as far as <HI>Grave&s;end;</HI> his Ma&s;ter was getting his Letters and Invoyces, and other Di&s;patches, ready for him, he being to go down the River the &s;ame Evening.</P>
<P>THE Hurry which thus di&s;patching him put his Ma&s;ter into, occa&s;ion'd, that when he was call'd to Dinner at the u&s;ual Hour, he did not take the young Gentleman with him as u&s;ual, but told him he mu&s;t be content to &s;tay in the Counting-hou&s;e 'till he came to relieve him.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="181">
ACCORDINGLY Dinner being over, he goes down to &s;end him up to Dinner. And when he came to the Counting-hou&s;e Door, there &s;at his Man with the Book-keeper al&s;o, writing as he left him.</P>
<P>IT happen'd ju&s;t that Moment, &s;ome occa&s;ion extraordinary oblig'd him to &s;tep back again, and go up Stairs to the Dining-Room, from whence he came; and intending not to &s;tay, he did not &s;peak to the young Man, but left him in the Counting|hou&s;e, and went immediately up Stairs.</P>
<P>IT was not po&s;&s;ible that he, or any one el&s;e, ex|cept &s;uch as could walk invi&s;ible, could go by, or pa&s;s him un&s;een: Good Manners would have hinder'd the young Man from thru&s;ting by his Ma&s;ter upon the Stairs, if he had been going up; but he is po&s;itive he did not, and cou'd not pa&s;s, without being &s;een.</P>
<P>BUT when he came to the top of the Stairs there &s;at the young Man at Dinner with the other Servants; the Room they din'd in being a little Parlour, which open'd ju&s;t again&s;t the Stairs, &s;o that he &s;aw him all the way of the upper Part of the Stair-ca&s;e, and could not be deceived.</P>
<P>THE Ma&s;ter did not &s;peak to him, which he was very &s;orry for afterwards; but the Surprize made him pa&s;s by the Room, and go into the Di|ning-Room, which was to the right Hand of it, but he &s;ent one immediately to look, and he was there really at Dinner; &s;o that what he (the Ma|&s;ter) &s;aw below in the Counting-hou&s;e, mu&s;t be the Apparition, as it certainly was.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all: The young Gentleman em|bark'd as above, and arriv'd &s;afe with all his Effects in <HI>America,</HI> tho' he never liv'd to return. However, I cannot &s;ay his Apparition in the manner as related could have the lea&s;t Relation to his being &s;ick, and dying abroad, which was not 'till three
<PB N="169" REF="182">
Years afterwards. But what follow'd was of another kind.</P>
<P>THIS young Man had an elder Brother, who liv'd in <HI>London;</HI> he was a fine Gentleman, and a Scholar, and was at that time &s;tudying Phy&s;ick. He was al&s;o a &s;tout brave Gentleman, and in parti|cular under&s;tood a Sword, that is to &s;ay how to u&s;e a Sword, as well as mo&s;t Gentlemen in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>HE had an accidental Rencounter with a Gentle|man in the Street, in that &s;hort Street which goes out of <HI>Fleet-&s;treet</HI> into <HI>Salisbury-Court;</HI> and being &s;o compleat a Ma&s;ter of his Weapon, he wounded his Antagoni&s;t, and drove him into a Tavern in the Street, from whence came out two Men more up|on him with their Swords, but both of them found the Gentleman &s;o much an Over-match for them, that they left him as fa&s;t as the fir&s;t; whereupon a fourth came out, not with a Sword, but a Fire|Fork taken ha&s;tily up out of the Tavern Kitchen, and running at this Gentleman with it, knock'd him down, and broke his Skull, of which Wound he afterwards died.</P>
<P>WHILE this was done in <HI>London,</HI> his Brother, as far off as <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> writing to his Ma&s;ter the Merchant, (and who gives this Account of it) after other Bu&s;ine&s;s, writ this Po&s;t&s;cript.</P>
<Q><P>SIR, I beg you will be pleas'd in your Return to this to let me have &s;ome Account, as much as conve|niently may be, of how my Brother does, and what Condition he is in; which you will excu&s;e my Importunity for, when you read the follow|ing Account, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P><P>THE <HI>20</HI>th of&mdash;la&s;t, about &s;ix a Clock in the Morning, lying in my Bed, and broad awake, my Bro|ther, or an Apparition of my Brother, came to the Bed's Feet, and open'd the Curtain, looking full in my Face, but did not &s;peak. I was very much frighted, but
<PB N="170" REF="183">
however I &s;o far recover'd as to &s;ay to him, Brother, what is the matter with you?</P><P><HI REND="margQuotes">HE had a Napkin-Cap on his Head, which was very bloody, he look'd very pale and gha&s;tly, and &s;aid, I am ba&s;ely murther'd by&mdash;naming the Per&s;on, but I &s;hall have Ju&s;tice done me; and then di&s;appear'd.</HI></P></Q>
<P>NOW this Letter was &s;o dated, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible any Account could be &s;ent of the Di&s;a&s;ter, that could reach thither in that time; for it was not dated above fourteen Days after the Fact was committed in <HI>London;</HI> and that it was Genuine I am well a&s;&s;ur'd, becau&s;e I &s;aw the Letter within an Hour after it was receiv'd in <HI>London,</HI> read it my &s;elf, and knew the young Man's Hand, and the young Man al&s;o perfectly well, as I did his Brother that was kill'd al&s;o, very intimately.</P>
<P>THE young Man was &s;ober, religious and &s;en&s;i|ble, not given to Whim&s;ie, or light-headed Fancies, not vapouri&s;h or di&s;temper'd, not apt to &s;ee double, or to dream waking, as many of our Apparition-making People are; he was be&s;ides that a Scholar, and very &s;erious: the fir&s;t I mention as a Protection to him from fooli&s;h Imagination, and the la&s;t from Fal&s;hood; and I am &s;atisfy'd, the Reader may de|pend upon both the Stories, I mean as to the Truth of them.</P>
<P>IN my &s;peaking of Apparitions as I have &s;tated the Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t take leave to differ from the No|tions of the Ancients, who 'tis evident under&s;tood all Apparition to be the Souls, or as we call them, the Gho&s;ts, of departed Per&s;ons; but when they came to make rational Conclu&s;ions from tho&s;e fir&s;t Opinions, What wild Additions were they driven to make, to the fir&s;t ju&s;t Conceptions which they had form'd in their Minds?</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="184">
THEIR fir&s;t Conceptions, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> were indeed ju&s;t, con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, and with Nature; for they concluded, that when the Body is dead, and the Soul &s;eparated, the State was determin'd. This Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> expre&s;&s;es very well in his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><L>For to the farther Shore</L>
<L>When once we pa&s;s, the Soul returns no more.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS was, I &s;ay, a rational and ju&s;t Sentiment; but then they were confounded in all tho&s;e Imagi|nations, by &s;eeing the Apparitions of their departed Friends, as if come back from tho&s;e eternal Shades; and how to reconcile this they did not know.</P>
<P>TO get over this Difficulty, they were driven to &s;trange Shifts, and &s;ome of them it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd were very fooli&s;h ones: &s;uch as the&s;e;</P>

<P>NOW between this Time, or during this Inter|val, that is to &s;ay, between Death and the Funeral Pile, they pretended they allow'd the &s;eparated or unembodied Souls of Men might appear, and vi&s;it their Friends, or harra&s;s their Enemies; and on this Occa&s;ion, the Gho&s;t of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> &s;lain by <HI>Hector</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> is brought in vi&s;iting his Friend <HI>Achilles,</HI> and begging of him to get his Funeral Rites perform'd, that he might be admitted to Re&s;t.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>HOMER</HI>'s Notion of the State of the Dead, was &s;omething like the ancient Philo&s;ophy of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> which gave the Soul a Shape like the Body, and that it was only a Receptacle of the Mind; the Mind they made to be the &s;ublime and &s;uperior Part, and that only.</P>
<P>THUS in the Ca&s;e of Apparitions, they allow'd that this Ca&s;e or Shell call'd the Soul, might ap|pear after Death, but the Mind could not, but was exalted among the Gods, and took up its Eter|nal Abode; from whence

<P>THIS la&s;t Notion, tho' gro&s;s and ab&s;urd in it &s;elf, was the utmo&s;t Refuge they had, by which to &s;olve the Difficulty of Apparitions.

<L>And I abandon'd.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Dead once pa&s;s'd to the <HI>di&s;mal Realms</HI> (as they call'd the Shades below) were <HI>gone for ever,</HI> and to return no more; but then they were perplex'd to find that they did return, as in this Ca&s;e of <HI>Patro|clus</HI> to <HI>Achilles;</HI> tho' that (by the way) was a Dream only, not an Apparition, or as we may call it an Apparition in a Dream, and no more.</P>
<P>BUT they had their Apparitions, and we read of many Apparitions of the Dead to the Living; as particularly in the famous Example of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> ap|pearing to <HI>Brutus:</HI> and this perplex'd them &s;o, that they knew not how to &s;upport the Principle of the Soul not returning, under the Experience of Souls actually returning in Apparition, vi&s;iting and con|ver&s;ing with their Friends, which was inconte&s;ti|ble, daily Experience making it known to all Parties.</P>
<P>TO reconcile this they fled to Invention, and fir&s;t to that of the Interval between the Death and
<PB N="175" REF="188">
the Funeral of the departed Souls; of which be|fore.</P>
<P>BUT this is liable to &s;o many ju&s;t Exceptions, &s;o many Ab&s;urdities, that it could not &s;atisfie Men of Sen&s;e; for fir&s;t they were obliged to &s;ay and prove, (which would be very difficult) that none of the Souls of the Dead ever appear'd after the Fune|ral Rites were &s;olemnized; which if one Example had contradicted, all the Arguments in the World could not then have &s;upported the Fiction; and this I cannot doubt was contradicted on many Oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>AND this no doubt made the ancient Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> be reviv'd, and pa&s;s better among them afterwards; tho' whether the <HI>Romans</HI> receiv'd it or no, we do not find a&s;certain'd in any Part of their Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there was an Ab&s;urdity in the very Doctrine it &s;elf; for if the Apparition of a departed Soul was limited by this Circum&s;tance of burning the Body, or performing the Funeral Rites; it put the State of the Dead in that particular Re&s;pect into the Power of the Living: <HI>for Example,</HI> If the Living, who had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dead Bodies of Per&s;ons &s;lain, &s;uppo&s;e them Friends, had Po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion of the Body, the Soul of that Body, tho' unembodied and di&s;mi&s;s'd, could not be admitted to re&s;t, or as they expre&s;s'd it, could not pa&s;s into the Shades or R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alms below; &s;o if the Enemy had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Body, it was in the Power of the Enemy to keep the Soul out of Heaven: an Ab&s;urdity &s;o gro&s;s, one would think the wi&s;er Heathens could never enter|tain &s;uch a Thought: Yet that &s;uch it was, the Words of <HI>Patroclus</HI>'s Gho&s;t quoted from <HI>Homer</HI> makes evident.</P>
<Q><L>Let my pale Cor&s;e the Rites of Burial know,</L>
<L>And give me Entrance in the Shades below.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="176" REF="189">
UNHAPPY <HI>Patroclus!</HI> How gro&s;s would this &s;ound, how har&s;h and unmu&s;ical in our Times, when Chri&s;tianity has given us more ju&s;t <HI>Ideas</HI> of things? <HI>Patroclus</HI> could not get leave to go to the Shades below, 'till his Funeral Rites were per|form'd; that is, in our Sen&s;e, could not be admitted, no not into Hell it &s;elf, 'till his Body was burn'd on the Funeral Pile or Pyre, and his A&s;hes depo|&s;ited in an Urn; that is, buried like a Gentleman.</P>
<P>BY which Rule, the Souls of tho&s;e poor Crea|tures who were killed in the Wars, and were left unburied in Heaps in the Field, or only a Pile of Stones thrown upon them, as was often the Ca&s;e, are wandring &s;till, and neither admitted into Hea|ven or Hell.</P>
<P>AGAIN, it was in the Power of the Enemy, if he had a Body in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to pre&s;erve his Hatred again&s;t that Enemy even beyond Death, and by keep|ing him unburied, keep his Soul or Spirit &s;u&s;pended, wandring, and forgotten in the Air, and neither ad|mitted to one or other Place, whether above or below.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Achilles</HI> had the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> in his Power twelve Days, and <HI>Homer</HI> brings him in triumphing over his Enemy in that ca&s;e, and in a manner unworthy of a Man of Honour.

So again, <HI>Achilles</HI> mourning over the Body of <HI>Pa|troclus</HI> as it lay on the Funeral Pile, and the Fire not yet kindled; I &s;ay, there again he threatens to deny <HI>Hector</HI> a Soldier's Burial.</P>
<Q><L>But heavier Fates on <HI>Hector</HI>'s Cor&s;e attend,</L>

<P>THIS was a terrible Cur&s;e, and very cruel to poor <HI>Hector</HI> after he was dead, not to &s;uffer his Soul to enter into the Shades below, which would be (to &s;peak it in our Language) not to give him leave to go to Hell; that the Gods it &s;eems thwarted <HI>Achilles,</HI> and would not let his Cruelty take place, but he was oblig'd to grant <HI>Priam</HI> a Truce, and let the <HI>Trojans</HI> bury him.</P>

<P>SO that the Burying of <HI>Hector</HI> was made the Care of the Gods, defeating the cruel Vengeance of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>TO what Length did this fooli&s;h Notion of the Ancients carry this Point! putting it into the Power of a Man's Enemy to keep his Soul out of Heaven too, as long as his Enemy thought fit to keep the Body out of the Grave.</P>
<P>HAPPY it is for us in the&s;e malicious Days that it is otherwi&s;e here; when not Enemies only, but even cruel Creditors, might arre&s;t the dead Body of their Debtor, and even &s;end the Soul of him to the <HI>Devil,</HI> or keep it hovering and wandring in the Air 'till their Debts were paid: As Times go now, and
<PB N="178" REF="191">
as Charity &s;tands now rated among us, no poor Debtor could be at Re&s;t any more after he was Dead, than he could before, 'till his Debts were all paid.</P>
<P>NAY, tho' it had pleas'd a merciful Father to forgive him his Sins, and as we allow it's po&s;&s;ible, in &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the cruel <HI>T&mdash;S&mdash;</HI>that a Brankrupt may die in the State of a pardoned Peni|tent; yet I &s;ay 'till the Debt was paid the more inexorable Creditor &s;hould refu&s;e to let him be ad|mitted into Heaven 'till he was paid the utmo&s;t Farthing.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s if this were the Ca&s;e among us, I believe it would be the harde&s;t thing in the World to get a poor Bankrupt's Compo&s;ition ac|cepted, or his Certificate &s;igned; for if it was in the Power of the Creditors to &s;end their Debtors to the <HI>Devil,</HI> I &s;hould be apt to &s;ay with the Di|&s;ciples of our Lord, <HI>Who then &s;hall be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>HOW often do we find a Creditor give it for an An&s;wer, when a &s;olliciting Friend comes begging him to compound, and to accept the utmo&s;t Shil|ling that the Debtor has to offer: How often, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> do we find the cruel Creditor reply, <HI>No not I, I'll &s;ign none of it, the</HI> Devil <HI>&s;hall have him before I'll &s;ign it?</HI></P>
<P>NAY, if his Soul was to hover in the Air, as the Ancients fancy'd, 'till the Body was buried; I que&s;tion whether they would let the Debtor go ei|ther to Heaven or Hell 'till they had their Money; e&s;pecially if the hovering or wandering in the Air was a wor&s;e Condition, as I don't know but, while the <HI>Devils</HI> are &s;aid to be there, it may.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Ancients and their Noti|on of Futurity, and of Souls departed, the Diffi|culty, as I have ob&s;erved, was very perplexing: They granted that after the Souls of Men were once determined, and tran&s;ported in <HI>Charon</HI>'s Ferry|boat to the other &s;ide of the River <HI>Styx,</HI> or the
<PB N="179" REF="192">
<HI>Stygian</HI> Gulph, they could return no more; and all their other Fables upon that Subject would have been overthrown and come to nothing, if it had been otherwi&s;e; &s;uch as <HI>Cerberus</HI> barking continual|ly at the Gate, <HI>Charon</HI> the Ferry-man carrying all over but bringing none back, and the like.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this, as I have &s;aid, they found &s;everal of the&s;e Souls vi&s;iting the World in Apparition, and this quite de&s;troy'd all the Scheme of their being in a determin'd State; &s;o that they knew not what to think of next.</P>
<P>HOW would it have unravell'd all tho&s;e hard Knots, and made every thing ea&s;ie to their Under|&s;tanding, had they been let into this ju&s;t way of rea&s;oning? had they di&s;cover'd that there is an An|gelick World, an invi&s;ible World of Spirits, &s;ome of whom being placed by their merciful Maker, as an advanc'd Body, at or near the out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r Circum|ference of the Earth's Atmo&s;phere, have a Power given them at lea&s;t to take Cognizance of human Affairs; and to conver&s;e with this World, either by Apparition, Voices, Noi&s;es, good or bad Omens, or other &s;en&s;ible Conveyances to the Mind, by which they can give Notices of Good or Evil, and can intimate to Man many things u&s;eful to him in the Conduct of his Life.</P>
<P>THAT the Spirits inhabiting this invi&s;ible World are at hand; (how near is not nece&s;&s;ary to us to know) can a&s;&s;ume Bodies, Shape, Voice, and even can per&s;onate this or that Man or Woman; &s;o as to appear in the very Figure, Countenance, and Cloaths or Dre&s;s of our departed Friends, &s;peak with their proper and di&s;tinct Voices, and in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of this or that particular Man or Wo|man, and in their Names; and can thus &s;uit them|&s;elves in their &s;everal Appearances, to the Occa|&s;ion they appear for:</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="193">
HAD they known the&s;e things, I &s;ay, they would have rejoic'd in the Di&s;covery, and it would have made every thing ea&s;ie to them. <HI>Patroclus</HI> would never have troubled <HI>Achilles</HI> with a Vi&s;it from the Air, upon pretence of his being left to be wandring about the Atmo&s;phere for want of his Funeral Rites; the Dogs, or the Crows, or the Worms might have fea&s;ted them&s;elves on <HI>Hector</HI>'s Carca&s;s, it would never have di&s;turb'd <HI>Hector</HI> in the lea&s;t, much le&s;s would her Godde&s;s-&s;hip <HI>Venus</HI> have concern'd her&s;elf to protect his Corps 'till the fu|neral Pile was prepar'd.</P>
<P>THE Doctrine of the Soul's being a Shell or Ca&s;e form'd into a Shape, as a Mould is form'd into Shape to receive the Bra&s;s or Copper, and throw out a Statue or Figure of this or that Heroe, which it is appointed to form; I &s;ay, this ab&s;urd Doctrine of the Soul, Body and Mind being three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons in every Man, would not have found Place in the World; but all things would have been conceiv'd regularly of, and the World would have been rightly inform'd of future things, as well as of things pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to bring it down to our Ca&s;e, all this concurs to the Doctrine of Spirits, and the Reality of their Appearance, which is the Ca&s;e be|fore us: Their Friends departed did appear; what it was appear'd they knew not, only negatively they knew it was not their Bodies, however the Shape might be a&s;&s;umed; nor could they reconcile that Part to their Under&s;tanding. How it could be, that the Body &s;eem'd to appear and did not appear; or, as we might &s;ay, appear'd as if they had appear'd; but when a Tryal was offer'd, no Body could be found, as was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Patro|clus</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> in <HI>Homer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> thus tran&s;lates,</P>
<LG>
<PB N="181" REF="194">
<L>He &s;aid, and with his longing Arms e&s;&s;ay'd</L>
<L>In vain to gra&s;p the vi&s;ionary Shade.</L>
<L>Like a thin Smoke he &s;ees the Spirit fly,</L>
<L>And hears a feeble lamentable Cry.</L>
</LG>
<P>HOW gro&s;s an Ignorance is here in &s;o great a Man as <HI>Achilles?</HI> to go about to gra&s;p a Vi&s;ion! to feel a Shade! One can hardly excu&s;e the Poet for allowing <HI>Achilles,</HI> who was the Heroe of the whole Poem, to be &s;o weak, even in tho&s;e Days; but it mu&s;t be allowed 'twas all in a Dream, and imagi|nary, and it might well awake him indeed, as it did, to gra&s;p at a Man in Armour, and find nothing in his Arms but Smoke.</P>
<P>THE Re&s;ult of it all is this, namely, the Re|ality of Apparition was a certain, undoubted, and received thing; 'tis evident that they were not que&s;tioned; for upon the Reality of the Appear|ance of Souls, all tho&s;e Pains were taken to &s;ettle the Po&s;&s;ibility of it. That it was &s;o, the Fre|quency of the thing left them no Room to que|&s;tion; it would have been ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iculous to have di&s;|puted it; but how it could b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, how to reconcile it to all the Notions of Soul and Body, the fu|ture and the pre&s;ent State, that was what no bo|dy could explain, and no body could under&s;tand; which Ignorance put their Invention &s;o much on the Rack to find out and form Schemes for the bringing the Particulars together, and making the Appearance po&s;&s;ible, whichthey daily found was in Fact real.</P>
<P>'TWAS a little &s;trange that tho' they were &s;atisfied by daily Demon&s;tration that the Thing was true, yet they were obliged to believe it was not true at the &s;ame time. They frequently &s;aw their Friends appear, and yet knew they were not in a Condition from whence they could return to appear. But the &s;trange&s;t thing of all, at lea&s;t to
<PB N="182" REF="195">
me, is, that they &s;hould not, all this while, con|ceive the Po&s;&s;ibility of Spirits a&s;&s;uming human Shape, and appearing in their Figures, in their Shapes, and in their Names.</P>
<P>THIS would have put an end to all the Dif|ficulty, and have reconciled all the Doubts that attended it, and at the &s;ame time would have led them into &s;everal &s;ublime Truths, &s;uch as they were perhaps perfectly ignorant of; as particularly into the great Doctrine of the Unity of infinite Power; the univer&s;al Empire of Providence, and its Government and Influence of and upon all the Affairs of this World, even the mo&s;t minute things in Life; and many other valuable Inquiries.</P>
<P>THAT Apparitions were believed to be real in tho&s;e Days, is evident from many In&s;tances of it given in Hi&s;tory, tho' I have not room to look far back. 'Tis &s;aid that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great was haunted by the Gho&s;t of his Friend <HI>Clitus,</HI> whom he had mo&s;t un|gratefully tortur'd to Death, after a long Series of the mo&s;t faithful Services, and &s;ucce&s;sful al&s;o; but there is no particular Account of it in <HI>Plutarch.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apparition of the Gho&s;t of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Brutus</HI> a little before the Battel at <HI>Philippi,</HI> tho' it be certain, is neverthele&s;s variou&s;ly reported; &s;ome Accounts relate it to be the Gho&s;t of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and vulgar Opinion concurs with that Re|port; which is &s;o receiv'd at this time, that they &s;how you an original antient Piece of fine <HI>Italian</HI> Painting at <HI>Naples,</HI> where the Phantome is repre|&s;ented bloody and wounded, with <HI>Ca&s;ca</HI>'s Dagger &s;ticking in his Shoulder, which he, <HI>Ca&s;ca,</HI> reaching his Arm over his Shoulder fix'd in or near his Col|lar Bone before, and left &s;ticking there; according to which our Fronte&s;piece to this Work is at lea&s;t de&s;ign'd: Whether that Part of the Story be right repre&s;ented or not, is difficult to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="196">
BUT according to other Accounts, the Appari|tion was only of a Man, without any Similitude of <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> and that when <HI>Brutus,</HI> who was bu&s;y writing Di&s;patches for his Army which was then drawing together to fight the <HI>Octavian</HI> Troops, look'd up and &s;aw him, he boldly ask'd, <HI>What art thou?</HI> and the Apparition an&s;wer'd, <HI>I am thy evil Genius, and I will meet thee again at</HI> Philippi; to which the undaunted Hero, unconcern'd at the Sight, and as if he de&s;ir'd him not to di&s;turb him at that time, he being then otherwi&s;e engaged, an&s;wer'd, <HI>Well, I'll meet thee there,</HI> and &s;o went on with his wri|ting.</P>
<P><HI>BRUTUS</HI> was, without doubt, a Hero in his per&s;onal Valour, and more &s;o in his Principle, <HI>viz.</HI> the Love of Liberty, and of his Country; and as nothing but the Zeal for the Liberty of his Coun|try could have embark'd him again&s;t the Life of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who was otherwi&s;e his Benefactor, &s;o he was above the Fear of Death, and could not be in the lea&s;t daunted at the Fore-knowledge of his Fate at <HI>Philippi;</HI> &s;eeing he had the Notion of Life which was general at that time, namely, that a true He|roe could never be mi&s;erable, &s;ince it was always in his Power to die a Freeman, and not to out-live any threatned Calamity, whether Per&s;onal or Na|tional.</P>
<P>UPON this foot he enter'd that unequal Battel again&s;t the <HI>Octavian</HI> Troops with an undaunted Chear|fulne&s;s; for he was &s;ure one way or other to come off victorious; that is to &s;ay, that if <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> con|quer'd his Army, he knew how to conquer <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> if by the Slaughter of his Troops <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had the better of him, and defeated his De&s;igns for the Li|berty of his Country, He, by the Slaughter of him|&s;elf, knew how to defeat <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in his De&s;igns of conquering <HI>Brutus,</HI> &s;ince he re&s;olv'd to die free, and not &s;urvive the <HI>Roman</HI> Liberty; and &s;o he did.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="197">
AND upon this Foundation it was, that he was &s;o unconcerned at his approaching Fate, and &s;o undaunted in his looking at and &s;peaking to the Spectre that appear'd to him.</P>
<P>BUT we have yet abundance more Proofs by Example of the Reality of Apparitions.</P>
<P><HI>ALARICH</HI> the famous <HI>Gothick</HI> King, who o|ver-run &s;o much of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, had an Ap|parition which came to him, and told him he &s;hould undertake his Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Romans,</HI> and that promis'd him Victory and Succe&s;s; &s;ome &s;aid it was an Angel, others that it was the Gho&s;t of his decea&s;ed Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Rhadagai&s;eus.</HI> When he fir&s;t undertook to rai&s;e his Army he was intending to go upon a glorious Expedition to the Ea&s;t, <HI>to wit,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Hunns</HI> and the <HI>Heruli;</HI> that is to &s;ay, into <HI>Poland, Sclavonia</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and per|haps <HI>Mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ovy</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> But upon the Apparition &s;peaking to him, he was encourag'd to undertake a War again&s;t the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">mans</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> where notwith|&s;tanding he was routed and utterly overthrown by <HI>Stilico<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> he afterwards return'd into <HI>Italy,</HI> kill'd <HI>Stilico</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> General, over-run the Country, and took and plunder'd the City of <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf; this was <HI>Ann.</HI> 409: &s;o that the Apparition, of what|ever kind it was, mu&s;t be &s;o far <HI>Angelic</HI> as to fore|know Events and I&s;&s;ues of things on Earth, which mu&s;t be &s;uitable to the Angelic Heavenly Spirits, and &s;uperior to the Diabolic Spirits who know nothing Prophetic.</P>
<P>NOR is it any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the An|gelic exalted and good Spirits; for this was not encouraging Evil, but &s;tirring up a powerful Prince, who was to be <HI>Flagellum Dei,</HI> to exe|cute the Divine Vengeance upon that wicked Peo|ple the <HI>Romans,</HI> whom God had re&s;olved to de&s;troy, or at lea&s;t to reduce very low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> like as God is

<P>I SAY this could not be the <HI>Devil,</HI> be|cau&s;e (as I have always in&s;i&s;ted upon it, &s;o I do &s;till) that he knows nothing of what is to come; the <HI>Devil</HI> is no Prophet, he cannot foretell or predict, oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> than by probable Gue&s;&s;es, rational Con&s;e|quences, and &s;uch Circum&s;tances in which he can go farther than other People.</P>
<P>YOU have an Example of this in the famous Sorcere&s;s <HI>Jaquelina;</HI> &s;he pretended to &s;peak in the Name of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and &s;ometimes to have the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;peak in her, and &s;o to give An&s;wers as by an Oracle, and re&s;olve Doubts and difficult Que&s;tions, which &s;he did to Admiration; and thereby got both Fame and Money. Now it was ob&s;erv'd that when People came to her with Doubts and difficult Ca&s;es, even &s;uch as none could re&s;olve, relating to things pa&s;t or pre&s;ent, her An&s;wers were &s;urprizing; but if they came to her to ask any Opinion of things future, and what &s;hould be to come, the <HI>Devil</HI> was always Nonplu&s;t, and generally lyed in his An&s;wers; &s;o that none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ould depend upon any thing he &s;aid. In a word the <HI>Devil</HI> was not able to foretell any thing; and hence I infer, as I havealways &s;aid, the <HI>Devil</HI> is no Prophet, he can predict nothing, for he knows nothing; and that if any Apparition comes to be &s;een or heard, who takes upon it to tell what &s;hould come to pa&s;s, you may depend upon it that Apparition is not from the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE I think we may readily account for that Story &s;o well publi&s;h'd, whether &s;o well known or no, of which Mr. <HI>Aubrey</HI> has given us the la&s;t Relation, as follows:</P>
<Q>TWO Per&s;ons (Ladies) of Quality, both not being long &s;ince decea&s;ed, were intimate Acquain|tance, and lov'd each other intirely: It &s;o fell out, that one of them fell &s;ick of the Small-Pox, and

The Gentleman that told this Story, &s;ays, that there is hardly any Per&s;on of Quality but what knows it to be true.</Q>
<P>I DO not enter into an Enquiry here whether the Story is true or no, I believe it in Common, for it was generally believ'd to be true: But 'tis &s;trange to have this brought for an Evidence of the Pre|&s;cience of the <HI>Devil;</HI> whereas on the contrary it con|firms what I have &s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> That this cou'd not be the <HI>Devil,</HI> or what we call the Appearance of the <HI>Devil,</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="200">
no, nor could it be the Soul of the departed Per&s;on; and for the Apparition &s;aying it could not be at Re&s;t, either it may be put in by &s;ome of the very many Authors relating the Story; or it might be &s;aid by the good Angel or Spirit appearing, to in|troduce her Me&s;&s;age, and to rouze the Mind of the Per&s;on &s;poken to by &s;omething that &s;hould touch her more to the quick, be the more feeling, and &s;en&s;ible to her, and &s;o make a due Impre&s;&s;ion upon her of the Truth of that which was to follow.</P>
<P>BUT fir&s;t, for its not being the <HI>Devil;</HI> for I have granted that the <HI>Devil</HI> may make an Appari|tion, tho' far from inferring from thence that all Apparitions are the <HI>Devil:</HI> But I &s;ay as to its not being the <HI>Devil</HI> that appear'd here, in the Shape of the deceas'd Lady, 'tis Evident,</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> Becau&s;e, as I &s;aid above, and have re|peated often, the <HI>Devil</HI> cannot predict, he has no Pre&s;cience of things before they are in View; he can juggle and play &s;curvy Tricks of many kinds, as when he prophe&s;ied to the Farmer the Fall of his Stack of Corn, and then rais'd a &s;udden Storm and blew it down. It may be he can &s;ee at &s;ome farther Di&s;tance than we can, and judge of the Con&s;e|quences of &s;uch and &s;uch Cau&s;es better than we can, and with a more perfect and exact Judgment. But to predict things which are only conceal'd in the Womb of Time, and behind the Curtain of Providence, as this of Life and Death was, it is not in <HI>Satan</HI> to do it; and therefore this could not be from the <HI>Devil:</HI> the Lady was in Health, was Chearful, nay Merry, was at a Fea&s;t and at Cards. Here was no Signal of Death, or &s;o much as of Sickne&s;s: I &s;ee no token of the <HI>Devil</HI> in this Ap|parition; except it be his extraordinary Civility that he would not interrupt her Game.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> It could not be the <HI>Devil,</HI> becau&s;e of his bidding the Lady prepare for Death;
<PB N="188" REF="201">
which, as I have often ob&s;erv'd, does not &s;eem to be much of Satan's Bu&s;ine&s;s, not being very &s;uitable to his Di&s;po&s;ition, and le&s;s to his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;ome little Incongruity in this Story too, which renders it incon&s;i&s;tent, not with the <HI>De|vil</HI> only, but even with the Nature of a Spirit or Apparition: As (1) Why &s;hould the Apparition come when the Lady was engag'd and could not &s;peak to her? as if &s;he, being a Gho&s;t or Spirit as we vulgarly expre&s;s it, did not know what &s;he was doing, as well as where &s;he was? (2) How does her taking ill the living Lady's not vi&s;iting her, ob|lige her to come and give her this kind Notice of her Death? <HI>I took it &s;o ill at your Hands, that I could not re&s;t 'till I had &s;een you.</HI></P>
<P>THO' this does not &s;hock my Belief of the Apparition it &s;elf; yet it &s;eems to hint that the &s;everal Hands thro' which the Relation has pa&s;s'd, have made up the Speech for the Gho&s;t, and com|mitted &s;ome Blunders in it, that are inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;hocking to the Reader.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems more rational to be as I have read the Story, that the Gho&s;t &s;hould &s;ay thus: <HI>Tho' I took it very ill at your Hands that you wou'd not come to &s;ee me;</HI> yet I could not re&s;t 'till <HI>I had &s;een you, to tell you that you have not long to live, and that you &s;hould prepare,</HI> &amp;c. This is much better Sen&s;e, and more agreeable to the Nature of the thing; for certainly coming in that manner to give the Lady No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ice of the Approach of her End, and to coun|&s;el her to <HI>prepare accordingly,</HI> mu&s;t be allow'd to be an act of Kindne&s;s, not of Re&s;entment, and a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;timony of the Affection that was between them; and therefore her taking it ill that &s;he had not been to Vi&s;it her in her Illne&s;s, could not rationally be given as a Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>BUT as to the Apparition it &s;elf, &s;ince it could not be the Soul of the deceas'd Lady, and for the

Rea&s;ons above was not likely to be the <HI>Devil,</HI> or I may venture to &s;ay po&s;itively was not the <HI>Devil;</HI> What then was it?

<P>THE Story of Sir <HI>John Burroughs</HI>'s Son, who for&s;aking a Mi&s;tre&s;s in <HI>Italy</HI> &s;he murther'd her &s;elf, and then haunted him as long as he liv'd, this is of like kind with the re&s;t; and tho' the <HI>Devil</HI> to worry and perplex him might take up the Appea|rance of his Whore, as well reproaching him with the Crime, as with her Tragical End; yet it goes no farther than this, that the <HI>Devil</HI> may appear, and may harra&s;s and terrify tho&s;e he appear'd to, and this I make no doubt of; and it rather adds to what is in&s;i&s;ted on, I mean the Reality of Appari|tions; but the <HI>Devil</HI> gave this Gentleman no good advice to repent, or prepare, and the like; but only appear'd, frighted, and terrify'd him to the very Day of his Death.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o remarkable, that tho' this <HI>Devil</HI> in Apparition &s;hewed it &s;elf to him the very Day of his Death, (for he was kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d that Day in a Duel) yet it &s;aid not a word to him of what was to befall him, or of what he was going to do, and 'tis very probable did not know it.</P>
<P>THERE is another Story &s;omething but darkly recorded of <HI>Charles</HI> VII. of <HI>France,</HI> which &s;eems likely enough to be an Apparition of the <HI>Devil.</HI> That King had been di&s;temper'd and very ill two or three times, but was recover'd again tolerably well, and was riding for the Benefit of the Air in the

Fore&s;t of <HI>Mans:</HI> On a &s;udden a Spectre &s;tarts up or out of the Woods, being a tall meagre ill-look'd old Man, of gha&s;tly Countenance and half naked, and coming directly to the King takes hold of his Hor&s;e's Bridle, and &s;ays, <HI>Stop, King: Whether go you? you are betray'd:</HI> and then immediateiy vani&s;hed. Now fir&s;t of all, this was a fal&s;hood in Fact, for the King was not betray'd by any body; neither was there any Plot again&s;t him, or again&s;t any that belong'd to him, ever heard of before, or after|wards; on the contrary, <HI>Secondly,</HI> his Reign was at that time peaceable and quiet, his Subjects all ea&s;y; and for his Per&s;on, he had &s;o few Enemies that he was call'd <HI>Charles the Beloved,</HI> and was exceed|ingly tendred by the generality of his People.</P>
<P>A GOOD Spirit, an Angelic Spirit, one of the Sacred Guard I have &s;uppos'd to be placed about this Earth, or in the Regions adjacent, and em|ployed by their Bountiful Maker for the good of Mankind, would never have come in &s;uch a man|ner, &s;urpri&s;ing, and at unawares. It would never have put on a fierce and frightful Countenance, thus to have terrified a poor di&s;temper'd Prince, who&s;e Brain was already di&s;order'd; taking the ad|vantage of his Weakne&s;s, and &s;o to encrea&s;e the Frenzy and Di&s;traction of his Mind even to his De&s;truction, for he never more perfectly recover'd his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS mightily differ'd from the Conduct of the &s;everal Spirits appearing in the Examples mention'd before, and who kindly warn'd the Per&s;ons of Dan|ger, foretold Events that they might avoid them, or prepare for the Con&s;equences; in a word, this was an Apparition purely <HI>Devili&s;h,</HI> for it was meerly to do Evil, and to the ruin of the Per&s;on to whom it appear'd.</P>
<P>I THINK nothing can be a ju&s;ter Rule for us to di&s;tingui&s;h Apparitions by: the Evil Spirit, <HI>Devil</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the different Nature of Apparitions; how we &s;hould behave to them; when to be afraid of or concern'd about them, and when not.</HEAD>
<P>DANGER may be the Rea&s;on of Caution; but Guilt only is the rea&s;on of Fear. Caution is the Mind's ju&s;t Regard to the Evil in view; but Fear is a Horror of the Soul, in apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome farther Evil yet out of view; un&s;een, and therefore terrible; merited, and therefore dreadful.</P>
<P>IF there were no Guilt in the Mind, Death it &s;elf would be no Evil, and therefore not the Sub|ject of our Fear; nor is Death it &s;elf our Fear now as it is in it &s;elf a meer pa&s;&s;ing out of life, otherwi&s;e than as it is an inlet of &s;ome terrible State beyond it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> It is not what we pa&s;s out of, that is the bitterne&s;s, but what we pa&s;s into; not what we part with, but what the Exchange will be; not the leap out of Light, but the leap into the Dark: and to come nearer to it, the Thought of what is beyond Death is only made better or wor&s;e by what we know on this &s;ide of it; the Dread of what is to come, is founded on our con&s;cious &s;en&s;e of what is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS State beyond Death is made our Terror, as we expect in it the Puni&s;hment of Offences, a
<PB N="192" REF="205">
Retrbitution for an ill-&s;pent Life, and as we have upon our Minds a Sen&s;e of Guilt; that is to &s;ay, a Con&s;cience of having ill-&s;pent our pa&s;t time, and dreading the Ju&s;tice of the Superior Hand, in whom is the Power of Rewards and Puni&s;hments. Now to bring it to the ca&s;e in Hand.</P>
<P>ALL Apparition is look'd upon as <HI>a &s;omething</HI> coming, or &s;ent to us, from that State of <HI>Being</HI>which is beyond Death, and therefore is look'd upon with the &s;ame Terror and Fright, which we are &s;eiz'd with at the Thoughts of Death it &s;elf.</P>
<P>HENCE, if we could con&s;ider calmly the Nature of the Apparition which we &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, we might pre|&s;ently know whether we ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> rea&s;on to be terrified at the Apparition, <HI>yea</HI> or <HI>no:</HI> If the Apparition comes with a Me&s;&s;age of Peace, if it reprehends with Kindne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s, if it admoni&s;hes with Gen|tlene&s;s, and gives Advice to amend and reform, it certainly comes from a good Hand, and we need be under no concern at all about it, becau&s;e it has no Evil in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>IF it come in all its threatning Po&s;tures, gha&s;tly as the <HI>Devil</HI> can make it, horrible as him&s;elf in Per|&s;on; yet were there no Guilt there would be no fear from the Apparition, or even from the <HI>Devil</HI> ap|pearing in Per&s;on; becau&s;e we &s;hould know our+&s;elves to be out of his Power.</P>
<P>AS then the Good or Evil of the Me&s;&s;age, which the Apparition brings, di&s;tingui&s;hes the Ap|parition it &s;elf, and tells us of what kind it is; &s;o as our Minds are, or are not intimidated by our own Guilt, &s;o we have or have not rea&s;on to be &s;ur|priz'd at the Appearance of a Me&s;&s;enger, or Me&s;&s;en|gers, from the invi&s;ible World, or at whatever he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hall &s;ay.</P>

MR. <HI>Aubery</HI> gives us the Story in his <HI>Mi&s;cellanea</HI> of the Apparition to <HI>Ca&s;hio Burroughs,</HI> E&s;q; in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I, and which I hinted at ju&s;t now on another occa&s;ion; the Story is as follows:</P>
<Q>SIR <HI>John Burroughs</HI> being &s;ent Envoy to the Emperor by King <HI>Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> I. did take his Elde&s;t Son <HI>Ca&s;hio Burroughs</HI> along with him; and taking his Journey through <HI>Italy</HI> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t his &s;aid Son at <HI>Florence,</HI> to learn the Language; where he having an Intrigue with a beautiful Courti|&s;an, Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Grand Duke, their Fami|liarity became &s;o publick, that it came to the Duke's Ear, who took a Re&s;olution to have him murder'd; but <HI>Ca&s;hio</HI> having had timely notice of the Duke's De&s;ign, by &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, immediately left the City without acquaint|ing his Mi&s;tre&s;s of it, and came to <HI>England.</HI> Whereupon the Duke being di&s;appointed of his Revenge fell upon his Mi&s;tre&s;s in mo&s;t reproach|ful Language: She, on the other, &s;ide re&s;enting the &s;udden departure of her Gallant, of whom &s;he was mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately enamour'd, killed her &s;elf. At the &s;ame Moment that &s;he expired &s;he did appear to <HI>Ca&s;hio</HI> at his Lodgings in <HI>London.</HI> Colonel <HI>Remes</HI> was then in Bed with him, who &s;aw her as well as he, giving him an account of her Re&s;entments of his Ingratitude to her, in leaving her &s;o &s;uddenly, and expo&s;ing her to the Fury of the Duke; not omitting her own Tra|gical <HI>Exit;</HI> adding withall, that he &s;hould be &s;lain in a Duel; which accordingly happen'd: And thus &s;he appear'd to him frequently, even when his younger Brother (who afterwards was Sir <HI>John)</HI> was in Bed with him. As often as &s;he did appear he would cry out with great Shricking and Trembling of his Body, as well as Angui&s;h of Mind, &s;aying, <HI>O GOD! h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;he comes, &s;he comes!</HI> and at this rate &s;he appear'd 'till he was
<PB N="194" REF="207">
kill'd. She appeared to him the Morning before he was killed. Some of my Acquaintance (&s;ays <HI>Aubery)</HI> have told me, that he was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t Men in <HI>England,</HI> and very Valiant.</Q>
<P>THE Appearance of this <HI>Devil,</HI> for I can call it no other, had nothing in View but to harra&s;s, plague and affright the Gentleman: Perhaps ex|pecting it &s;hould bring him into &s;ome fit of De&s;pe|ration; &s;o to de&s;troy him&s;elf, as the Woman who appear'd had done before.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman whom it appear'd to, was con|&s;cious of Crime; the Woman in who&s;e &s;hape the <HI>Devil</HI> thus harra&s;s'd him was a <HI>Courte&s;an,</HI> that is in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a Common Woman, with whom he had had an Intrigue in <HI>Italy:</HI> He had not only been di&s;hone&s;t with her, but it &s;eems had been di&s;hone&s;t to her; and the la&s;t, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Devil,</HI> had it &s;eems work'd &s;o upon her Rage as to cau&s;e her to be her own Executioner; and I take the Apparition to be the <HI>Devil</HI> pur&s;uing the &s;ame Management, and endeavouring to produce the &s;ame Effect upon him.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ee the Con&s;equence of Crime: the &s;en&s;e of Guilt makes this Apparition dreadful to him; when it appear'd, he trembles, falls into Convul|&s;ions, cries out, <HI>O GOD! here &s;he comes!</HI> and in a word, is in an Agony of horror and affright.</P>
<P>HAD he only convers'd with the Lady as a com|mon Acquaintance, had he neither been concern'd with her, or had done any di&s;honourable thing by her, he had natural Courage to have look'd the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Face, and boldly have ask'd <HI>what bu|&s;ine&s;s &s;he could have with him.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE read of a Story of a very religious La|dy, who the <HI>Devil,</HI> it &s;eems, had &s;ome particular Picque at, and &s;et all his Stratagems at work to ruin her, both Soul and Body. He attack'd her in a hundred &s;everal ways in Covert, as I may call it,
<PB N="195" REF="208">
that is to &s;ay by Attempts to draw her into Crime, alluring her, and laying Snares for her of &s;everal kinds. But when he found him&s;elf &s;teadily re&s;i&s;ted by the Lady's re&s;olv'd Virtue, Mode&s;ty and Tem|perance, he attack'd her in Per&s;on with frightful Apparitions, a&s;&s;uming ugly and terrible Shapes; and once appearing all in Fire, with a frightful threat|ning Voice, he told her he was come to fetch her away: The Lady had a &s;ecret Spirit of Courage and Re&s;olution came upon her at the very Moment, and, as we &s;ay in other ca&s;es, brisking up to him as if &s;he would fight him: Re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Devil, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> and he &s;hall flee from us! come for me! <HI>added &s;he,</HI> I'll venture that! for I am &s;ure thou lie&s;t, <HI>Sa|tan,</HI> thou ha&s;t nothing to do with me.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Devil</HI> call'd her Whore, and told her &s;he lov'd &s;uch a Man, who was a marry'd Man, and therefore &s;he had intentionally committed Whore|dom with him, and &s;hould be damn'd.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It &s;eems the Lady had lov'd that Gentleman before he was otherwi&s;e engag'd, by marrying; but had never had any Thought towards him, or the lea&s;t Acquaintance with him, afterwards.</P>
<P>THOU &s;howe&s;t thy&s;elf, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> to be full of Subtilty, a real <HI>Devil,</HI> and even Malice it&s;elf: it is true, I did love that Gentleman, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and thou &s;etted&s;t him to work to per&s;uade me that he lov'd me, and to court me with honourable Preten&s;ions, and &s;o far gain'd upon me, that I really loved him; but&mdash;</P>
<P>HERE he interrupted her, and told her, Such a time, &s;ays the <HI>Devil,</HI> you wi&s;h'd you were a-bed with him, and you are as guilty by wi&s;hing to Sin, as if you had done it.</P>
<P>THOU art the Father of Lies, <HI>Satan, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> and the Father of Lyars, and thou lie&s;t in this; nay, thou lie&s;t like a <HI>Devil,</HI> that is maliciou&s;ly, for thou knowe&s;t that it is not true.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="209">
YOU will be damn'd, &s;ays he, and I will take you away this minute.</P>
<P>THOU can&s;t not take me away without God's Permi&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and he will not give me into thy Hands; therefore touch me at this Peril: and with that &s;he fell down on her Knees, and cry'd, LORD, <HI>pre&s;erve me from the evil Spirit:</HI> with which the <HI>Devil</HI> left her, and walk'd off.</P>
<P>THESE are Apparitions that may be call'd Ap|paritions of <HI>Devils</HI> indeed, and by his Works you may know him, for this is acting like him&s;elf; but where there is no Guilt we need not be afraid of the <HI>Devil,</HI> in whatever Shape or frightful Figure he thinks to attack us in.</P>
<P>THIS Lady had never been able to reproach <HI>Satan</HI> with Lying, if what he &s;aid had been true; but &s;he knew her&s;elf innocent, and that put Courage into her Soul, that &s;he indeed Bully'd the <HI>Devil,</HI> defy'd him, and bad him do his wor&s;t.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems the <HI>Devil</HI> rumag'd hard to find a Crime out to charge this Lady with, and came up to her very clo&s;e; but he was put to his &s;hifts for Evidence; for even in collecting all the Actions of her Life, he could not find any thing of real Guilt to load her with.</P>
<P>HE attack'd her after this in &s;everal Shapes, and one time he told her &s;he wou'd be damn'd for a Hypocrite; for, &s;ays he, for all your pretended Sanctity you was in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion at &s;uch a time, and you cur&s;t your Cou&s;in&mdash;naming her Name to her.</P>
<P>SHE an&s;wer'd, as before, boldly; And Satan. <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> tho' you are a Devil, and cannot be a&s;ham'd, yet you are too cunning and too knowing to act like a Fool; I was angry, but in no Pa&s;&s;ion; and for my Anger I had ju&s;t cau&s;e; but thou wa&s;t the cau&s;e of the Crime, and &s;o of the Anger too: For &s;he own'd the <HI>Devil</HI> tempted my Kin&s;woman to rob

me, &s;o thou ha&s;t been the Occa&s;ion both of her Sin, and of my Anger.</P>
<P>BUT you curs'd her, and wi&s;h'd the <HI>Devil</HI> (mean|ing me, &s;ays he) might take her.</P>
<P>THAT'S like thee again, <HI>Devil, &s;ays the Lady;</HI> I was far from wi&s;hing thou &s;hould&s;t take her, I am not &s;o much thy Friend to wi&s;h thou &s;hould&s;t be gra|tified in any one's Ruin. But I told her, indeed, if &s;he did &s;uch things, thou would&s;t take her a|way.</P>
<P>BUT you ly'd in that, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for I won't hurt her.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> thou art &s;o much her Friend.</P>
<P>SHE is mine already, <HI>adds the Devil,</HI> I &s;hall not do her any harm.</P>

<P>YES, yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you &s;hall be mine quickly, as well as &s;he.</P>

<P>BUT, &s;aid he, you play'd at Cards again&s;t your Con&s;cience too, when you believ'd it was a Sin to play, and you will be damn'd for that.</P>
<P>WHY truly, <HI>Devil, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> you go neare&s;t the Truth in this of any thing you have &s;aid; for after our Mini&s;ter's talking again&s;t Play, one Evening, he &s;o far per&s;uaded me that it was not lawful, that I did re&s;olve to leave it off.</P>
<P>BUT you broke your Word, and play'd again; and did it, I tell you, again&s;t your Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I DID not tie my&s;elf by any Promi&s;e, but I did que&s;tion a little, indeed, whether I &s;hould play a|ny more or no.</P>
<P>YES, and did it again&s;t your Con&s;cience, I tell you, and you &s;hall be damn'd for that.</P>
<P>HERE the Lady could not refrain Tears; but &s;till &s;he an&s;wer'd the <HI>Devil</HI> boldly: As thou art a Lyar, Satan, I hope I &s;hall not, becau&s;e thou &s;aye&s;t I &s;hall. However, thou &s;halt never have it to up|braid me with again; for tho' I did not pro|mi&s;e to Man, I now promi&s;e it to the <HI>Devil,</HI> I will never play more.</P>
<P>IT'S too late now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and threatned her again.</P>
<P>NO, <HI>Satan, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> never too late for any one to Repent, <HI>but Thee;</HI> and thou &s;halt never Repent, or be Forgiven.</P>
<P>WITH this, &s;ays my Story, the <HI>Devil</HI> left her. I have taken this, by Abridgement, from a very large Account of the &s;everal Di&s;putes this coura|geous Lady had with the <HI>Devil</HI> for &s;ome Years; which if I could a&s;&s;ert the Particulars &s;o as to be &s;ure of the Truth of every Part, and of my own Knowledge too, I &s;hould make farther u&s;e of here; but thus far they are to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, namely,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="199" REF="212">
1. THAT where the <HI>Devil</HI> appears, he always does it like a <HI>Devil,</HI> for &s;ome wicked Purpo&s;e or other.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHERE he cannot prevail and excite to do Mi&s;chief, he a&s;&s;aults with Rage, and threatens with &s;uffering Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>THE good Spirits or good Angels are quite of another Kind; and as they come, or are &s;ent from other Hands, &s;o they come of other Errands and in another manner, as I &s;hall give a more parti|cular Account of pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT let us from hence enquire into an Opini|on which I have met with, and that of &s;ome Men of Learning and Judgment, <HI>viz.</HI> That take the Apparitions in general, whether of good or bad Spirits, they never, or very rarely, do any harm. As for the good Spirits, we know, as above, they will do none; and if the bad do not, 'tis be|cau&s;e they can't.</P>
<P>THE good Spirits, 'tis certain, will do no harm; it is by their general appearing for good, that we determine them to be good Spirits; and that kind of Judgment is certainly very ju&s;t: but if the evil Spirits, which do appear, do no harm neither, it is becau&s;e they are under &s;ome extraor|dinary re&s;traint of Divine Power; &s;o that tho' they may come about in the Air, they are not &s;uffer'd to do any con&s;iderable Mi&s;chief in the World. In both which ca&s;es all the Occa&s;ion of our Terror about them is taken away; for whether they are good Spirits, or evil Spirits re&s;train'd, 'tis much the &s;ame; one will do you no hurt, and the other cannot; and there remains no room then for the Pannick, which is &s;o much upon us, when we hear of them.</P>
<P>IT is true that Angels have &s;ometimes been &s;ent in Judgment from Heaven, and have execu|ted God's terrible Threatnings upon Men in an
<PB N="200" REF="213">
apparent Shape; as the Angel call'd the De&s;troy|ing Angel, which <HI>David</HI> &s;aw in the Air, with his Sword drawn and &s;tretch'd over <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to de|&s;troy it, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxi. 15. So the Angel of the Lord that &s;lew 180000 of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> in one Night; and it is not improbable that an Ho&s;t of Angels or Apparitions appear'd in the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Camp, and cut in Pieces the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Army, with a Terror that they were not able to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE are extraordinary and miraculous Ca&s;es; &s;o likewi&s;e is that when the Angel appeared to <HI>Balaam</HI> with a flaming Sword, and told him that if the A&s;s had not turn'd away from him, he (the <HI>Angel)</HI> had &s;lain him, <HI>Numb.</HI> xxii. 33. But we are not now &s;peaking of Angels &s;ent out with e&s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ions to execute God's Vengeance, but of the Apparition of good Spirits or Angels from the invi&s;ible World of Spirits, who frequent|ly appear, and &s;ometimes upon &s;mall and very tri|fling Occa&s;ions, and who vi&s;it People as well by Night as by Day; this we call Walking, and Ap|parition, and this is &s;uch as is the Subject of our pre&s;ent Enquiry.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e it is that I &s;ay, however they may di&s;turb us, and however terrified we are about them, they very rarely do any harm.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard of an Apparition which came to a Farmer in <HI>Surry,</HI> and threatned him that he would burn his Hou&s;e and his Barn, and all his Corn and Hay; what his Pretences were the Story does not relate, or what the poor Farmer had done to di&s;oblige him; but the Man was, it &s;eems, in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, and expo&s;tulated with the Apparition a great while; but at la&s;t he pluck'd up his Spirits, and &s;poke with a little more Courage to it.</P>
<P>WHAT art thou, &s;ays he, that threatne&s;t me thus without a cau&s;e, and &s;aye&s;t thou wilt ruin me,
<PB N="201" REF="214">
notwith&s;tanding I never did thee any wrong? thou &s;hould&s;t be the <HI>Devil,</HI> by thy u&s;age of me, for good Spirits never do any Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>TO this the <HI>Devil</HI> an&s;wer'd in a long, and to appearance, a threatning Speech, but in a Language the poor Man did not under&s;tand one Word of.</P>
<P>I KNOW not what thou &s;aye&s;t, <HI>&s;ays the Farmer,</HI> but I tell thee again thou &s;eem'&s;t to me to be the <HI>Devil,</HI> or one of his Angels, and I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e are Words under&s;tood in the bottomle&s;s Pit; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hreaten me no more with thy Rage, and with burning my Hou&s;e and Corn; thou art a great Dra|gon indeed, but thou art chain'd, and can&s;t do no|thing but what thou art permitted to do by thy Maker, and I fear thee not. Upon which the poor Man pray'd Mentally that he might be deliver'd from the Power of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and away run the Spectre, and did him no harm.</P>
<P>THIS was certainly a commendable Courage, and had &s;omething of the Chri&s;tian in it too; and &s;uch a Courage, and upon the like Foundation, would, for ought I know, lay all the <HI>Devils</HI> that ever walk'd, and drive away all the Apparitions and Spirits that People are &s;o terribly haunted with, and &s;o terrify'd about.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of Apparitions in Dream, and how far they are or are not real Apparitions.</HEAD>
<P>THERE may be Dreams without Apparition, as there may be Apparitions without Dreams; but Apparition in Dream may be as really an Apparition as if the Per&s;on who &s;aw it was awake: The difference may be here, that the Apparition
<PB N="202" REF="215">
in a Dream is vi&s;ible to the Soul only, for the Soul never &s;leeps; and an Apparition to the Eye|&s;ight is vi&s;ible in common Per&s;pective.</P>
<P>HOW is it then that we &s;ee in our Dreams the very Faces and Dre&s;s of the Per&s;on we dream of; nay, hear their Voices, and receive due Impre&s;&s;ions from what they &s;ay, and oftentimes &s;peak to them with our own Voices articulately and audibly, tho' we are fa&s;t a&s;leep? What &s;ecret Power of the Imagi|nation is able to repre&s;ent the Image of any Per|&s;on to it&s;elf, if there was not &s;ome Appearance, &s;omething plac'd in the Soul's view, by a &s;ecret, but invi&s;ible Hand, and in an imperceptible man|ner? which Something is in all Re&s;pects, and to all Purpo&s;es, as compleatly an Apparition, as if it was plac'd in open &s;ight when the Per&s;on was awake.</P>
<P>THE Scripture confirms this Opinion by many Expre&s;&s;ions directly to the purpo&s;e, and particu|larly this of Appearing, or Apparition in Dream. <HI>Gen.</HI> xx. 3. <HI>God came to</HI> Abimelech <HI>in a Dream;</HI> had it been &s;aid that <HI>Abimelech dream'd</HI> that God came to him, there might have been &s;ome excep|tion to the Parallel; but God actually <HI>came to him:</HI> and what tho' <HI>Abimelech</HI> was a&s;leep, and in a Dream, it was not the le&s;s an Apparition, for <HI>God came to him,</HI> and &s;poke, <HI>and &s;aid to him:</HI> and in the 4th Ver&s;e <HI>Abimelech</HI> &s;poke to the Apparition. What|ever the Shape was, that the Text does not men|tion; but <HI>Abimelech</HI> knew who he talk'd with too, that's evident, for the Text mentions it fully, <HI>And he &s;aid,</HI> LORD, <HI>wilt thou &s;lay al&s;o a righteous Nation?</HI> and &s;o he goes on, Ver&s;e the fifth, to expo&s;tulate and plead for him&s;elf and his People, <HI>&s;aid he not unto me, &s;he is my Si&s;ter?</HI> &s;o that he knew he was &s;peaking to <HI>the Lord.</HI> The Text is very remarkable, it is plain that there was an Ap|parition, but the Man was a&s;leep and in a Dream.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="216">
AGAIN in the ca&s;e of <HI>Laban</HI> pur&s;uing <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> xxxi. 24. <HI>God came to</HI> Laban <HI>the</HI> Syrian <HI>in a Dream by Night, and &s;aid unto him.</HI> Here again is an Apparition, and a &s;peaking Apparition too; GOD came to him, and GOD &s;poke to him; and <HI>Laban</HI> owns, not that he dream'd of God's appearing, but that God really &s;poke to him, <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>The God of your Father &s;pake to me Ye&s;ter-night, &s;aying.</HI></P>
<P>CERTAINLY Dreams in tho&s;e Days were ano|ther kind of thing than they are now. God &s;poke to them, and they an&s;wer'd; and when they were awake they knew that it was God that &s;poke, and gave heed to the Vi&s;ion or Apparition of God to them.</P>
<P>THERE are many more In&s;tances of the like in the &s;acred Hi&s;tory; as fir&s;t in the remarkable ca&s;e of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> iii. 5. <HI>The Lord appeared to</HI> Solomon <HI>in a Dream by Night, and</HI> GOD <HI>&s;aid, ask what I &s;hall give th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is call'd in the Scripture a Dream, <HI>v.</HI> 15. <HI>and</HI> Solomon <HI>awoke, and behold it was a Dream;</HI> and yet it is all confirmed; and the Petition that <HI>So|lomon</HI> made, tho' in his Sleep, or Dream, is ac|cepted and an&s;wer'd as his real Act and Deed, as if he had been awake. A good hint, <HI>by the way,</HI> that we may both plea&s;e and offend in our Dreams, as really as if we were awake; but that is a hint, I &s;ay, by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Solomon</HI> is very remarkable to the ca&s;e in hand. If my Readers plea&s;e to believe that there was &s;uch a Man as <HI>Solomon,</HI> and that he had &s;uch a Dream; they mu&s;t allow al&s;o that it was a real Apparition, God appeared to him in a Dream.</P>
<P>TO bring it down a &s;tep lower: as God has thus Per&s;onally appeared to Men in Dreams, &s;o have inferior Spirits, and we have Examples of this too in the Scripture. <HI>Matt.</HI> i. 20. <HI>While he thought on</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="217">

<P>I WILL for once &s;uppo&s;e, that no Man need de|&s;ire any farther Evidence than the&s;e for the Reality of the thing it &s;elf; we may bring it down from hence by ju&s;t Parallels to Matters within our own Reach, Experience will furni&s;h us with particular Pa&s;&s;ages &s;ufficient; and &s;ome Account I &s;hall give you within the Compa&s;s of our own Times; in which if I do as much as po&s;&s;ible, as I have done all along, omit all tho&s;e Accounts which others have publi&s;h'd, re|fering you to tho&s;e Publications for the particulars, and only give you new and more modern Accounts, &s;uch as come within the Verge of my own Know|ledge, or of the Knowledge of &s;uch as I have good Rea&s;on to give Credit to; I believe the Variety will be as acceptable, and much more u&s;eful than a bare Repeating of what others have &s;aid. If I find it needful to quote what others have publi&s;h'd, you &s;hall have it ju&s;tly mark'd as a Quotation, that you may &s;earch for the Truth in its Original.</P>
<P>BUT before I come to Quotation, or to Col|lection of Story, 'tis needful to ob&s;erve here al&s;o, that as it has pleas'd God to appear in this Man|ner, and to cau&s;e Angels to appear al&s;o in the &s;ame Manner, and upon &s;pecial Occa&s;ions, &s;o I make no Que&s;tion but the <HI>Devil</HI> often appears in Dreams too; and I might give but too many Examples of it, as particularly one in the Scripture.</P>
<P>IT is apparent that God gave <HI>Satan</HI> a kind of general Licen&s;e to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">flict <HI>Job,</HI> only not to kill him; with &s;uch a terrible Commi&s;&s;ion it might be expected
<PB N="205" REF="218">
the <HI>Devil</HI> would fall upon him with the ut|mo&s;t Fury he was capable of, or at lea&s;t that he was allow'd to take; he ruin'd his Fortunes, reduc'd him to Mi&s;ery, murther'd his Children, tormented him with Boils and Sores; in &s;hort, left him no|thing but Pot&s;herds, and an ill Wife to relieve him; and as he had worry'd him, to u&s;e a modern Phra&s;e, <HI>within an Inch of his Life,</HI> he follow'd him in the Night with Apparition, le&s;t he &s;hould recruit Na|ture with Re&s;t, and be a little refre&s;h'd with Sleep. <HI>Job</HI> him&s;elf complains of it, <HI>Job</HI> vii. 14. <HI>Thou &s;care&s;t me with</HI> DREAMS, <HI>and terrifie&s;t me</HI> with VISIONS. Not that GOD appear'd to <HI>Job</HI> in any frightful or terrible Form; but the <HI>Devil,</HI> to whom God was pleas'd to give a Liberty of afflicting <HI>Job,</HI> took that Liberty, and exerted his Malice to the utmo&s;t in &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Manner.

<P>'TIS thought by &s;ome, who critically note tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Part of the Text where <HI>Pilate</HI>'s Wife warn'd her Husband to have nothing to do in condemning Chri&s;t to be crucified, that it was the <HI>Devil</HI> that &s;tirr'd her up to oppo&s;e it. <HI>Satan,</HI> as &s;oon as he perceiv'd that the Death of Chri&s;t, however inten|ded for Mi&s;chief by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and pur&s;ued violently by them in their Rage and Malice at our Lord per|&s;onally, was yet a thing appointed by the determi|nate Council of God, for the Salvation of Man|kind: I &s;ay, as &s;oon as he perceiv'd that Part, which 'tis probable he did not know before, he &s;trove all he could to prevent it; and as fierce as he had been to irritate the <HI>Jews</HI> before, and rai&s;e their
<PB N="206" REF="219">
Fury and Malice up to a Pitch, even to almo&s;t rab|balling the Governor into it; now he under-hand &s;trove to prevent it, and us'd this Stratagem among others by attacking <HI>Pilate</HI>'s Wife in the Night, and &s;etting her to per&s;uade her Husband, that he was going to deliver up an innocent Per&s;on to gratifie the <HI>Jews;</HI> and that he &s;hould have a care what he did. Matt. xxvii. 19. <HI>When he was &s;et down on the Judg|ment-&s;eat, his Wife &s;ent unto him, &s;aying, Have thou nothing to do with that ju&s;t Man: For I have &s;uffer'd many things this Day in a Dream, becau&s;e of him.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER it was &s;o or not, 'tis very probable the many things &s;he &s;uffer'd mu&s;t be from the <HI>Devil;</HI> becau&s;e Heaven, by who&s;e determinate Council and Fore-knowledge the Death of Chri&s;t was appointed, would have done nothing to have prevented or interrupted his own Appointment.</P>
<P>NOW as the Dreams in tho&s;e Days, and our Dreams at this Time, are exceeding different; and that as our Heads are &s;o full of impertinent Thoughts in the Day, which in proportion crowd the Imagination at Night, &s;o our Dreams are tri|fling and fooli&s;h: How &s;hall we do to know when they are to be taken Notice of, and when not? When there is a real Apparition haunting us, or &s;howing it &s;elf, to us and when not? in a word, when an Angel, or when a <HI>Devil,</HI> appears to us in a Dream?</P>
<P>IT is a nice Que&s;tion, and as it does not parti|cularly relate to the pre&s;ent Enquiry, &s;o it would require too long a Digre&s;&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e Critically upon it; but I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s it with this &s;hort An|&s;wer, We mu&s;t judge, as I &s;aid before in the Ca&s;e of open Apparitions, by the Weight, and by the Na|ture of the Me&s;&s;age or Errand which the Appari|on comes about; evil Me&s;&s;engers &s;eldom come of good Errands, and Angels good or bad &s;eldom come on trifling Me&s;&s;ages.</P>

TRIFLING Dreams are the Product of the Mind being engag'd in trifling Matters; a Child dreams of its Play, a Hou&s;e-wife dreams of her Kitchen, a Nur&s;e of the Children, a Trade&s;man of his Shop; the&s;e have nothing of Apparition in them; nothing of Angels or Spirts, God or <HI>Devil;</HI> but when Dream comes up to Vi&s;ion, and the Soul is embark'd in a &s;uperior Degree, to a Commerce above the ordinary Rate, then you may conclude you have had &s;ome extraordinary Vi&s;itors, that you have been in &s;ome good or bad Company in the Night, and you are left to judge of what kind, by the Sub&s;tance or Tenour of the Vi&s;ion. If it be to open the Under&s;tanding, to encrea&s;e Knowledge, to &s;eal In&s;truction; in a word, if it is for direction to good Actions, or &s;tirring up the Soul of Man to perform his Duty to God or Man, 'tis certainly from above; 'tis an Apparition from God, 'tis a Vi&s;ion of Angels and good Spirits. Job xxxiii. 15. <HI>In a Dream, in a Vi&s;ion of the Night, when deep Sleep falleth upon Men, in &s;lumbrings upon the Bed.</HI></P>
<P>IF it be an Allurement to Vice, laying before you an Opportunity to &s;teal, pre&s;enting an Object of Beauty, an Intic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ment to commit an unlawful Action; depend upon it 'tis from the dark Regions, 'tis an Apparition of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and he employs his Agents, and perhaps attends in Per&s;on to draw you into Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> HERE 'tis worth a wi&s;e Man's con&s;ider|ing, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> repre&s;enting a Temp|tation to any Per&s;on in a Dream, and the Per|&s;on complying, he is not guilty of the Fact as really as if he had been awake. I leave it only as a Head of Reflection: For Example,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;ubtle in his Contrivance, as well as vigilant in Application of Circum&s;tances, knows a Man to be in perplex'd Circum&s;tances, di&s;tre&s;s'd for
<PB N="208" REF="221">
want of Money, a peri&s;hing Family, a craving Ne|ce&s;&s;ity; he comes in his Sleep and pre&s;ents him with a little Child dre&s;s'd up with Jewels of a great Value, and a Pur&s;e of Gold in its Hand, and all this as happening in a Place perfectly opportune for the Purpo&s;e, the Nur&s;e having negligently left the Child out of her Sight.</P>
<P>AS he pre&s;ents the Temptation, he &s;tands at the Per&s;on's Elbow; prompts him; &s;ays, Take away that Chain or String of Pearl, and the Pur&s;e, the Child is alone, it can tell no Tales, take it quickly; are not you in Di&s;tre&s;s, and do you not want it at this time to an Extremity, and can any one ever di&s;co|ver it? the Child's Friends are rich, it will do them no hurt; if they valu'd &s;uch things, they would never have put them about a little Child, it is no great Matter to them; be&s;ides 'tis due to their Vanity and O&s;tentation, which was the only rea|&s;on of dre&s;&s;ing up a little Child in &s;uch a Manner. Come, come, take it up quickly, it may &s;ave you from Ruin, and as &s;oon as you are able, you may make them Satisfaction again, and &s;o di&s;charge your Con&s;cience. The Man, unable to re&s;i&s;t the Snare, con&s;ents, &s;trips the innocent Child of its Ornaments, and goes away un&s;een; but in a Moment or two wakes with the Surpri&s;e, &s;ees it is a Cheat, and looks back on it with a double Regret. 1. That he is di&s;appointed of the Prize which he wanted, and fancy'd him&s;elf reliev'd by. 2. That the <HI>Devil</HI> Triumphs over him, and he is both deluded into the Crime, and deceived in the Expectation of its Reward.</P>
<P>I COULD give this in the Form of a Relation of Fact, and give Evidence of the Truth of it; for I had the Account of it from the Per&s;on's own Lips, who was attack'd in Sleep, and (as he &s;aid with a &s;incere Affliction) yielded to the Temptation; and I committed the barbarous Robbery, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="222">
with the utmo&s;t Re&s;entment; I plunder'd and &s;trip'd the poor &s;miling Infant, who innocently play'd with me when I took off its Ornaments, gave me the Pur&s;e of Gold out of its little Pocket, and bid me keep it for her to play with. I robb'd it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> in my Imagination, and de&s;erve as much to be hang'd for it, as if I had actually committed the horrid Fact at Noon-day; Ay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> with a kind of Tremor in his Con&s;cience from the Horror of the Fact, I ought to be hang'd for it, and to be damn'd for it too, for I as really and effectually did it as if I had been apprehended and carry'd to <HI>Newgate</HI> for it.</P>
<P>IT is true, it gave him a particular Satisfaction, with re&s;pect to his Per&s;onal Safety, that he had not committed the Fact; but it gave him no le&s;s Trouble in his Con&s;cience, than if he had been actually guilty.</P>
<P>WHAT was this but an Apparition of the <HI>Devil,</HI> a real vi&s;ible Apparition! vi&s;ible to the Mind, tho' not to the Body? and that in a double Capacity too; the <HI>Devil without</HI> in the Temptation, and the <HI>Devil within</HI> yielding to it.</P>
<P>I KNOW another living Example of this kind, and I had that Part too from the Per&s;on him&s;elf: He was a &s;ober religious Gentleman; he was in the letter of it a &s;ingle Man; for tho' he had been unhap|pily married, he liv'd in a &s;eparate State from his Wife; and, to &s;ay no more of it, upon a ju&s;tifiable Occa&s;ion, namely, that his Wife was wickedly gone away, as he &s;uppos'd, with another Man.</P>
<P>BEFORE he was marry'd to the unhappy Wo|man, he had lov'd a very hand&s;om beautiful Lady, and had gone &s;o far as to court her a long time for Marriage; but &s;ome Difficulty in their Circum&s;tan|ces prevented their coming together, and he took another; which the fir&s;t Lady re&s;ented &s;o, as that it co&s;t her too dear, for &s;he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>THE Affliction of this was very heavy to him,
<PB N="210" REF="223">
after he found him&s;elf abus'd in his real Marriage, as above. I &s;ay after, for at fir&s;t it &s;eems it was not. Under the melancholy Reflections of the&s;e contrary Circum&s;tances, which frequently loaded his Mind, He dreams one Night, that his former Mi&s;tre&s;s came to him with a &s;miling Countenance; I might have ex|pre&s;s'd it rather, that his former Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>appear'd to him in a Dream,</HI> and with a &s;miling chearful Coun|tenance, told him, that his Run-away Wife was Dead, and now you are mine, &s;ays the Apparition. He receiv'd the News with a particular Satisfaction, and embrac'd the Lady, as his former Inclinations dictated to him; he had not the lea&s;t Notion, as he prote&s;ted &s;olemnly, or the lea&s;t Remembrance that &s;he was dead.</P>
<P>WHEN he awak'd, and found it all a Dream, he was exceedingly afflicted with the Surpri&s;e; looking upon him&s;elf to be as really Guilty, as if he had been awake, and the Lady alive; and I can|not but &s;ay he had &s;ome Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>WHETHER this, if really True, could be any thing but an Apparition of an evil Spirit; the <HI>De|vil</HI> laying a Snare for him, and prevailing with him in Dream in a manner, and to commit a Crime, which he could not prevail with him to be guilty of when &s;he was alive.</P>
<P>I COULD give an Account of another Per&s;on, whom the <HI>Devil</HI> haunted frequently, and that for many Years together, with lewd Apparitions; temp|ting him in his Sleep with the Company of beau|tiful Women, &s;ometimes naked, &s;ometimes even in Bed with him; and at other times in Conver&s;ation prompting him to Wickedne&s;s, and that &s;ometimes he was prevail'd upon to con&s;ent; but always hap|pily prevented by waking in time: But the Ca&s;e has on two or three Occa&s;ions been mention'd by other Hands, and the Per&s;on is too much known to allow the farther De&s;cription of it, without his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="224">
I CANNOT doubt but the&s;e things are &s;tated formal Apparitions of the <HI>Devil;</HI> and tho' the Per|&s;o nmay be a&s;leep, and not thoroughly &s;en&s;ible either of what he is doing, or of what is doing with him, yet that the evil Spirit is actually pre&s;ent with him in Apparition, I think will not admit of any Que|&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE World is too full of Examples of this kind, to enter into a long Account of the Parti|culars. There is hardly a Book upon the Subject but is filled up with hi&s;torical Relations; hardly a Per&s;on to be convers'd with upon the Subject, but is full of them, either for them&s;elves or &s;ome of their Acquaintance; and every one is rendering their Dreams to be con&s;iderable, and all to come to pa&s;s: But out of five hundred Dreams &s;o told, and which &s;o much Stre&s;s is &s;eemingly laid on, 'tis hard to find one that we can call a real Ap|parition in Dream.</P>
<P>THE great, and perhaps one of the great|e&s;t Difficulties of Life, I mean that relates to Dreams, is to di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;uch as are real Apparitions, and &s;uch as are only the Product of an incumber'd Brain, a di&s;temper'd Head, or which is wor&s;e, a di&s;temper'd Mind: But &s;ome Dreams are &s;o &s;ignificant, and there follows &s;uch an imme|diate vi&s;ible Effect an&s;wering the de&s;ign'd Illumi|nation, that it cannot but be &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>A CERTAIN Gentleman who had lately buried his Wife, a Lady of great Piety and Virtue, was &s;o exceedingly afflicted at his Lo&s;s, that among o|ther melancholy things which were the Effect of it, this was one; that he was &s;o far from de&s;iring to marry again, that he entertained a &s;ettled ri|veted Aver&s;ion to the whole Sex, and was never thoroughly ea&s;ie in their Company; and thus he liv'd near two Years.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="225">
AFTER a certain time his Wife appear'd to him in his Dream, or he dream'd that he &s;aw his Wife; but I rather put it in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e: She came to him, as he thought, to the Bed&s;ide, with a &s;mi|ling and plea&s;ant Countenance, and calling him by the Term which &s;he always gave him, <HI>My Deare&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HE was in a great Con&s;ternation, but could not &s;peak to her; but &s;he &s;aid, Do not be afraid of me, I will do you no Hurt; and then &s;aid, What is the Rea&s;on that you mourn thus for me?</P>
<P>He &s;till &s;aid nothing; that is to &s;ay, he dream'd that he &s;aid nothing, but that he fetch'd a deep Sigh.</P>
<P>COME, come, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> Friends lo&s;t are Friends lo&s;t, and cannot be recalled.</P>
<P>THEN he &s;poke, <HI>that is dream'd that he &s;poke,</HI> and ask'd her, why &s;he appear'd to him.</P>
<P><HI>SHE &s;aid,</HI> to put an End to his unrea&s;onable Grief.</P>
<P>HOW can that be? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> You now encrea&s;e my Grief, by bringing your &s;elf thus to my Remem|brance.</P>
<P>NO, no, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you mu&s;t forget me, and pray take another Wife, which will be the way to cau&s;e you to forget me effectually.</P>
<P>NO, no, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that I can never do; and how can you de&s;ire it of me?</P>
<P>YES, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I do de&s;ire it of you, and I come to direct you whom you &s;hall have.</P>
<P>HE de&s;ir'd &s;he would talk no more to him; for, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you cannot be my Wife; it mu&s;t be &s;ome evil Spirit come to tempt me in &s;uch a Shape, and to de&s;troy me.</P>
<P>WITH that &s;he &s;eem'd to weep, and to pity him.</P>
<P>HE &s;igh'd again, and de&s;ir'd that if &s;he was able to retain any Affection to him in the Condition &s;he

<P>BUT the Que&s;tion from all this Story is only this, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether, &s;uppo&s;ing the Ca&s;e to be litte|rally true, was this an Apparition, or was it on|ly a &s;imple Dream? I affirm it mu&s;t be an Appari|tion, that is to &s;ay, a Spirit came to him in the Per&s;on of, or per&s;onating his Wife.</P>
<P>THE following Story I had from the Mouth of the very Per&s;on who was chiefly concerned in it, I mean the Captain of the Ship it&s;elf.</P>
<P>ONE Captain <HI>Thomas Rogers,</HI> Commander of a Ship called the <HI>Society,</HI> was bound on a Voyage from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Virginia</HI> about the Year 1694.</P>
<P>THE Ship was hired in <HI>London,</HI> and being &s;ent light, as they call it, to <HI>Virginia</HI> for a Loading of Tobacco, had not many Goods in her outward bound, &s;uppo&s;e about two or three a hundred Ton, which was not counted a Loading, or indeed half her
<PB N="214" REF="227">
Loading; the Ship being very large, above five hundred Ton Burthen.</P>
<P>THEY had had a pretty good Pa&s;&s;age, and the Day before had had an Ob&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, whereupon the Mates and proper Officers had brought their Books and ca&s;t up their Reckonings with the Cap|tain, to &s;ee how near they were to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>America;</HI> they all agreed that they were at lea&s;t about an hundred Leagues Di&s;tance from the Capes of <HI>Vir|ginia.</HI> Upon the&s;e cu&s;tomary Reckonings, and with|all heaving the Lead, and finding no Ground at an hundred Fathom, they &s;et the Watch, and the Captain turn'd in (as they call it at Sea) that is, went to Bed.</P>
<P>THE Weather was good, a moderate Gale of Wind, and blowing fair for the Coa&s;t, &s;o that the Ship might have run about twelve or fifteen Leagues in the Night aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r the Captain was in his Cab|bin.</P>
<P>HE fell a&s;leep, and &s;lept very &s;oundly for about three Hours, when he waked again, and lay 'till he heard his &s;econd Mate <HI>turn out,</HI> and relieve the Watch; and then he call'd his chief Mate as he was going off from the Watch, and ask'd him how all things far'd; who an&s;wer'd, that all was well, and the Gale fre&s;hen'd, and they run at a great Rate; but 'twas a fair Wind and a fine clear Night; &s;o the Captain went to &s;leep again.</P>
<P>ABOUT an Hour after he had been a&s;leep again, he dream'd that a Man pull'd him or wak'd him, and he did wake. I am not &s;ure, but I think he &s;aid the Thing that wak'd him bad him get up, that is, turn out and look abroad. But whether it was &s;o or no, he lay &s;till and compos'd him&s;elf to &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ep, and drop'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> again, and &s;uddenly awak'd again, and thus &s;everal times; and tho' he knew nothing what was the Rea&s;on, yet he found it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to go to &s;leep, and &s;till he heard the
<PB N="215" REF="228">
Vi&s;ion &s;ay, or thought he heard it &s;ay, <HI>turn out and look abroad.</HI></P>
<P>HE lay in this Unea&s;ine&s;s near two Hours, but at la&s;t it encreas'd &s;o upon him, that he could lie no longer, but gets up, puts on his Watch Gown, and comes out upon the Quarter-deck; there he found his &s;econd Mate walking about, and the Boat|&s;wain upon the Foreca&s;tle, the Night fine and clear, a fair Wind, and all well as before.</P>
<P>THE Mate wondering to &s;ee him, at fir&s;t did not know him; but calling, Who's there? the Cap|tain an&s;wer'd, and the Mate returns, Who, the Captain! what's the matter, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>SAYS the Captain,</HI> I don't know, but I have been very unea&s;ie the&s;e two Hours, and &s;ome body or my own Fancy bid me turn out and look abroad, tho' I know not what can be the meaning of it.</P>
<P>THERE can be nothing in it, but &s;ome Dream, <HI>&s;ays the Mate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SAYS the Captain,</HI> How does the Ship Cape?</P>
<P>SOUTH-WEST by South, <HI>&s;ays the Mate;</HI> fair for the Coa&s;t, and the Wind Ea&s;t by North.</P>
<P>THAT'S all very good, <HI>&s;ays the Captain;</HI> and &s;o, after &s;ome other u&s;ual Que&s;tions, he turn'd about to go back to his Cabin; when, as if it had been &s;ome body that &s;tood by him had &s;poke, it came into his Mind like a Voice, <HI>Heave the Lead, heave the Lead.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this he turns again to his &s;econd Mate, Mate, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> when did you heave the Lead? what Water had you?</P>
<P>ABOUT an Hour ago, <HI>&s;ays the Mate,</HI> &s;ixty Fa|thom.</P>
<P><HI>Heave again,</HI> &s;ays the Captain.</P>
<P>THERE'S no manner of Occa&s;ion, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mate,</HI> but if you plea&s;e it &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>I DON'T know, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> 'tis needle&s;s in|deed, I think; and &s;o was going away again,
<PB N="216" REF="229">
but was, as it were, forc'd to turn back as before, and &s;ays to the Mate, I know not what ails me, but I can't be ea&s;ie; come call a Hand aft, and heave the Lead.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY a Hand was called, and the Lead being ca&s;t or heaved, as they call it, they had Ground at eleven Fathom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>THIS &s;urpriz'd them all, but much more when at the next Ca&s;t it came up &s;even Fathom.</P>
<P>UPON this the Captain in a Fright bad them put the Helm a Lee, and about Ship, all Hands being order'd to back the Sails, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE proper Orders being obeyed, the Ship &s;tay'd pre&s;ently and came about; and when &s;he was about, before the Sails fill'd, &s;he had but four Fa|thoms and a half Water under her Stern; as &s;oon as &s;he filled and &s;tood off, they had &s;even Fathom again, and at the next Ca&s;t eleven Fathom, and &s;o on to twenty Fathom; &s;o he &s;tood off to Seaward all the re&s;t of the Watch, to get into deep Water, 'till Day|break; when being a clear Morning, there were the Capes of <HI>Virginia</HI> and all the Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> in fair View under their Stern, and but a very few Leagues Di&s;tance: Had they &s;tood on but one Cable's length farther, as they were going, they had been <HI>Bump a-&s;hore</HI> (&s;o the Sailors call it) and had certainly lo&s;t their Ship, if not their Lives.</P>
<P>NOW, what could this be? Not the <HI>Devil,</HI> that we may vouch for him, he would hardly be guil|ty of doing &s;o much good; hardly an Angel &s;ent from Heaven Expre&s;s, that we dare not pre&s;ume; but that it was the Work of a waking Providence, by &s;ome invi&s;ible Agent employ'd for that Occa&s;ion, who took Sleep from the Captain's Eyes; as once in a Ca&s;e of infinitely more Importance was done to King <HI>Aha&s;uerus;</HI> This we may conclude. Had the Captain &s;lept as u&s;ual, and as Nature requir'd,
<PB N="217" REF="230">
they had been all lo&s;t; the Shore being flat at a great Di&s;tance, and, as I &s;uppo&s;e, the Tide low, the Ship had been a-ground in an In&s;tant, and the Sea, which run high, would have broke over her, and &s;oon have da&s;h'd her in Pieces.</P>
<P>HOW it happen'd that the Mates and other Navigators on Board (for it being a very great Ship, they had &s;everal experienc'd Men among them) &s;hould all of them have kept, and yet all be out in their Reckoning, and that &s;o much as to think them|&s;elves an hundred Leagues from the Coa&s;t, when they were not above twenty or twenty five, that was to be accounted for among them&s;elves; but cer|tain it was, if it had not been for thus being wak'd and jogg'd in the Night, and kept awake too in &s;pite of his own Drow&s;ine&s;s, the Captain had lain &s;till, and the whole Ship's Company been in the utmo&s;t Hazard.</P>
<P>IF this was not an Apparition, it mu&s;t be what the Scripture calls it in another Ca&s;e, being <HI>warned of God in a Dream;</HI> which by the way is the &s;ame thing; but here was &s;omething more than being warned, for the Captain own'd he was in no Dream. He dream'd nothing at all, much le&s;s any thing of Danger; he went to his Bed or Cabbin with all the prudent Caution that any Man in that im|portant Tru&s;t of a Ship in the Ocean could do; and then after having made their Calculations, ca&s;t up their Reckonings, &s;et their Watch, and made every thing &s;ure, he laid down with all the Satisfaction that it was po&s;&s;ible for any Man in a like Ca&s;e to have.</P>
<P>TO any Men that under&s;tand the Sea Affairs, this Ca&s;e will be more feelingly and &s;en&s;ibly read; they will be more touch'd with the Surprize the Ship's Company mu&s;t be all in, to &s;ee them|&s;elves ju&s;t running a-ground, when they believed them&s;elves an hundred Leagues from the Shore, to
<PB N="218" REF="231">
find them&s;elves within two Inches of Death, when they believ'd them&s;elves as &s;afe as a Ship at Sea with a moderate Gale and a fair Wind could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>AND how will tho&s;e modern Wits, of which our Age is &s;o full, account for this, who allow no God or Providence, no invi&s;ible World, no Angelick, kind and waking Spirits, who, by a &s;ecret Corre|&s;pondence with our embodied Spirits, give merci|ful Hints to us of approaching Mi&s;chiefs and im|pending Dangers, and that timely, &s;o as to put the Means into our Hands to avoid and e&s;cape them?</P>
<P>WHICH way will &s;uch Men &s;olve the main Difficulty in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this, <HI>viz.</HI> What this &s;hould be? Will they re&s;olve it all into fortuitous Chance, meer Accident, a meer Circulation of things in the ordinary Cour&s;e? As they &s;ay Shoals are rai&s;ed to bar up a Haven, which they tell us, is nothing but the Sand and Stones driven down the Stream of a Ri|ver, which lodge here or there, as their own Weight, or the abating Force of the Water, or this or that Eddy and Counter-&s;tream checks them, &s;o deep'ning one Channel where it was Shoal, and choaking up another where it was deep, and all by meer Acci|dent: But this is very gro&s;s arguing.</P>
<P>IT were ea&s;ie to confute the&s;e weak pretences to Chance and Incident, and to &s;how the nece&s;&s;ity of an intelligent Being; but that is not my work: I am not upon the Reality of &s;uch an intelligent Be|ing, but the Reality of its ordinary and extraordina|ry actings, the Agents it employs, and the manner of their executing the Commi&s;&s;ions they receive; which 'tis evident they faithfully perform, and effectually too; &s;ometimes by one method, &s;ome|times by another, and particularly by this of Ap|parition, as well to the Eyes of the Soul, as to the Eye of the Body, &s;leeping or waking 'tis the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="232">
OUR Friends the Criticks may &s;tumble here, perhaps, at the &s;eeming contradiction in the Terms, as particularly this of invi&s;ible Apparition. But 'tis ea&s;ily &s;olv'd, by an&s;wering that it is but a &s;eem|ing Contradiction, for both the Apparitions are vi|&s;ible, only not to the &s;ame Optick Powers; the Ap|parition in Dream is vi&s;ible to the intellectual &s;ight, to the Eye of the Soul; and the Day-light Appari|tion is vi&s;ible to the common ordinary &s;ight: and you have an Expre&s;&s;ion in the Scripture often made u&s;e of, which gives an unque&s;tion'd Authority for this way of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ing things dream'd of, as things &s;een, is very frequent in the Sacred Text. <HI>Jacob</HI> dream'd a Dream about <HI>Laban</HI>'s Cattle, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxi. 10. where 'tis thus expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>and I &s;aw in a Dream.</HI> Again <HI>Daniel,</HI> vii. 1, 2. <HI>Daniel</HI> had a Dream and Vi&s;ions of his Head upon his Bed, v. 2. <HI>and I &s;aw in my Vi&s;ion by Night:</HI> v. 7. after this I &s;aw in <HI>the Night Vi&s;ions, and behold a fourth Bea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI> and v. 13. <HI>I &s;aw in the Night Vi&s;ions, and behold;</HI> and be&s;ides this, we have the &s;ame way of &s;peaking ten or eleven times in the &s;ame Chapter, and as many or more times in the next.</P>
<P>'TIS the like in relating the Dreams of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> or the Apparitions rather which appear'd to tho&s;e Kings in Dream. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Jo&s;eph, Gen.</HI> xli. 17, 18, 19. In my Dream <HI>I &s;tood upon the Bank of the River, and</HI> BEHOLD <HI>there came up;</HI> that is the &s;ame thing as, I &s;aw them come up: v. 19. and BEHOLD <HI>&s;even other Kine came up,</HI> or I &s;aw &s;even other Kine come up. So that an Apparition in Dream is vi&s;ible to the Soul, the Imagination &s;ees, tho' the Eyes of the Body are clos'd.</P>
<P>THIS Digre&s;&s;ion is owing to the nice Judgment of our Criticks, who&s;e exactne&s;s you &s;ee I mightily reverence, and am wonderful careful not to fall under
<PB N="220" REF="233">
their dreadful Hands, in a thing &s;o e&s;&s;ential to my Subject; as for Trifles, I leave them to trifle with them to the utmo&s;t of their more malicious Impotence.</P>
<P>BUT I come now to another Relation of Fact, which al&s;o I take upon me to vouch the Reality of, having been pre&s;ent at the very in&s;tant of every part of it.</P>
<P>A PERSON, who&s;e Name it is not &s;o proper to mention here, but who may be produc'd if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion, being &s;till living, was under the di&s;a&s;ter, about the Year 1701, to fall under a Party Cen&s;ure, (the occa&s;ion is needle&s;s to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.) In hopes, upon the Rece&s;s of the Hou&s;e, which was not far off, he &s;hould (as is u&s;ual) be at Liberty, he withdrew him&s;elf, and avoided being taken up as much as he could; but the Hou&s;e re&s;enting it, a Vote was pa&s;t, ordering the Secretary of State to pro&s;ecute him at Law; which oblig'd him to re&s;olve to leave the Kingdom, and in the mean time to conceal him&s;elf with more exactne&s;s; the Govern|ment having i&s;&s;ued out a Proclamation for appre|hending him, with a Reward to the Per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;cover where he was, &s;o as he might be taken.</P>
<P>IN order to conceal him&s;elf more effectually, he left his Lodging where he had been hid for &s;ome time, and remov'd to <HI>Barnet</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Hert|ford&s;hire;</HI> intending, as &s;oon as he had &s;ettled &s;ome Family Affairs, to go away North into <HI>Scotland:</HI> But before he went away he was oblig'd to come once more to <HI>London,</HI> to &s;ign &s;ome Writings for the &s;ecuring &s;ome E&s;tate, which it was fear'd might be &s;eiz'd by Out-law, if the Pro&s;ecution had gone on &s;o far.</P>
<P>THE Night before he had appointed to come to <HI>London,</HI> as above, being in Bed with one Mr. <HI>R&mdash;D&mdash;</HI>he dream'd that he was in his Lodgings at <HI>London,</HI> where he had been conceal'd as above, and
<PB N="221" REF="234">
in his Dream he &s;aw two Men come to the Door, who &s;aid they were <HI>Me&s;&s;engers,</HI> and produc'd a War|rant from the Secretary of State to apprehend him, and that accordingly they &s;eiz'd upon and took him.</P>
<P>THE Vi&s;ion &s;urpriz'd and wak'd him, and he waked Mr. <HI>D</HI>&mdash;his Brother-in-law, who was in Bed with him, and told him the Dream, and what a Surprize he was in about it. Mr. <HI>D</HI>&mdash;&s;eeing it was but a Dream, advis'd him to give no heed to it, but compo&s;e him&s;elf and go to &s;leep again, and he did &s;o.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as he was fa&s;t a&s;leep again, he was wak'd again with the &s;ame Dream exactly as before; and he awak'd his Brother again, as before<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> It di&s;turb'd them both very much; but being heavy to &s;leep, they both went to &s;leep again, and dream'd no more. It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that he &s;aw the very Men that apprehended him, their Countenances, Cloaths, Weapons, &amp;c. and de&s;crib'd them in the Morning to his &s;aid Brother <HI>D</HI>&mdash;in all the Particulars.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Call to go to <HI>London</HI> being as he thought urgent, he got ready in the Morning to go, re&s;olving to &s;tay but one Day, and then &s;et forward for <HI>Scotland.</HI> Accordingly he went for <HI>Lon|don</HI> in the Morning, and that he might not be known, walk'd it on Foot; that &s;o he might go by more private ways over <HI>Enfield Cha&s;e,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Southgate, Horn&s;ey,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>ALL the way as he walk'd his Mind was heavy, and oppre&s;s'd; and he frequently &s;aid to his Bro|ther who walk'd with him, that he was certain he was going to <HI>London</HI> to be &s;urpriz'd: and &s;o &s;trong was the foreboding Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Mind, that he once &s;top'd at <HI>Horn&s;ey,</HI> and endeavoured to get a Lodging, intending to &s;end his Brother to <HI>London</HI> to &s;ee if nothing had happen'd there to give him any Alarm.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="235">
AS he had ju&s;t &s;ecured a convenient Lodging, he accidentally &s;aw a Gentleman &s;tanding at the next Door, who he knew very well, but dur&s;t not venture to tru&s;t on that Occa&s;ion; and finding on Enquiry that he dwelt there, he concluded that was no Place for him, and &s;o re&s;olv'd to go for|wards.</P>
<P>THE Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Mind continuing, he &s;top'd again at <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> and endeavour'd to get a Lodging there; but could not: &s;o at la&s;t, when his Brother brought him word he could not get a Lodging, except where it was too publick, Well, &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he, than I mu&s;t go to <HI>London,</HI> and take what follows; or to that purpo&s;e; and accordingly did go, and the next Morning was taken by the Me&s;&s;engers, ju&s;t in the very manner as he had been told in his Dream; and the very &s;ame two Men, who&s;e Faces he had &s;een, and with the &s;ame Cloaths on and Weapons, exactly as he had de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>THIS Story I had from his own Mouth, and confirmed by Mr. <HI>R&mdash;D&mdash;</HI>his Brother-in-law, to whom he related his Vi&s;ion at the very Moment of it, as above.</P>
<P>I REFER it to any impartial Judgment to weigh every Circum&s;tance of this Account (the Truth of which I have not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to que|&s;tion) and to tell me, by what Powers, and from what Influence could the&s;e things be perform'd, if there were no invi&s;ible World, and no Inhabitants there, who concern'd them&s;elves with our Affairs? no good Spirits which convers'd with our embo|died Spirits, and gave us due intelligence, notice, and warning of approaching Danger.</P>
<P>IF there is any Difficulty in this Ca&s;e, it &s;eems to me to be in the Event of the thing, as in the Ca&s;e mention'd: Why was not the Intelligence made &s;o compleat, &s;o forcible, and the Impre&s;&s;ion

&s;o plain, that the Per&s;on in who&s;e Favour it was all done might have been effectually alarm'd, his go|ing forward &s;topt, and con&s;equently the Mi&s;chief which was at hand, and which he had the notice of, effectually prevented?</P>
<P>IT is not indeed &s;o ea&s;y to an&s;wer that part; but it may be re&s;olv'd into this, that the Fault &s;eems to be our own, that we do not give due attention to &s;uch notice, as might be &s;ufficient to our Delive|rance. If an Enemy be at hand, and the Out-Cen|tinel fires his Piece, he does his Duty; if the whole Camp does not take the Alarm, but are &s;urpriz'd, the fault is their own, the Man did all that was to be expected from him; nor do the Officers or Ge|nerals &s;light the notice, and &s;ay 'tis nothing but a &s;orry Fellow &s;hot off his Mu&s;quet, and &s;o take no more heed to it.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, they conclude the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntinel is po&s;ted upon Duty; he would not fire his Piece without a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e, and give a fal&s;e alarm to the Camp for nothing; ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t be &s;omething extraordinary, and accordingly they order the Drums to beat, and immediately call to Arms.</P>

ANOTHER Account I had a &s;ufficient Voucher for, tho' the Gentleman is now dead; but I had great rea&s;on to believe the truth of it.</P>
<P>A YOUNG Gentleman of good Birth and For|tune, in the beginning of the late War with <HI>France,</HI> had a violent inclination to &s;ee the World, as he call'd it, and re&s;olv'd to go into the Army; his Fa|ther was dead, and had left him a good E&s;tate; that is to &s;ay, between four and five hundred Pounds a Year; be&s;ides his Mother's Joynture, which after her Life would fall to him of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS Mother earne&s;tly entreated him not to go into the Army; but pre&s;t him rather to tra|vel, and &s;o might &s;ee the World, as &s;he &s;aid, without feeling the Calamities of the War, and without hazarding his Life.</P>
<P>HE told her Travelling indeed in time of Peace was all a Gentleman could do, and was at be&s;t very expen&s;ive; but that now was the time a Man might &s;ee the World at the expence of the Pub|lick, and perhaps might make his Fortune too.</P>
<P>HIS Mother repre&s;ented the danger of his Life, and bad him con&s;ider how many Gentlemen went into the Army, and of them, have few liv'd to come home again, much le&s;s to ri&s;e to any degree of Pre|ferment.</P>
<P>HE made light of all that, and told his Mother (as is the general Saying of warm Heads when they pu&s;h their Fortunes, as they call it,) that if he hap|pen'd to be knock'd on the Head there was an End of him, and he was provided for.</P>
<P>WELL, Son, &s;ays the old Lady, I am oblig'd to &s;ubmit to it, you are your own Ma&s;ter; but re|member your Mother's Tears, (and with tho&s;e Words &s;he wept;) I can but entreat you not to go, you have E&s;tate enough to make you ea&s;y; let tho&s;e go who&s;e narrow Circum&s;tances make the hazard rational, and let them go abroad to die, that
<PB N="225" REF="238">
can't tell how to live; you can pay tho&s;e that do go; you have no need to run the Ri&s;que, who do not want the Pay.</P>
<P>HE &s;lighted all her entreaties, and told her, if his Father was alive he did not doubt but he would give his Con&s;ent, for he had done the &s;ame thing in his young Days.</P>
<P>NO, no, Son, &s;aid his Mother, your Father knew better; he took a Commi&s;&s;ion when he was the younge&s;t of three Sons, and had nothing to expect at home but the fate of a younger Brother; but as &s;oon as he heard that his Elder Brothers were both dead, and the E&s;tate all come to him, he laid down his Arms, &s;old his Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid he had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Army; and he would tell you the &s;ame thing if he was alive: he u&s;ed always to &s;ay, that the Sword and the Book are the Portions of younger Brothers, the Coach and the Equipage is for the Heir.</P>
<P>WELL, 'twas all one; whatever his Mother's Arguments could do, or even &s;peaking Tears cou'd &s;ay, nothing could prevail; but he mortgag'd part of his E&s;tate to purcha&s;e a Company in the fir&s;t Regiment of Guards, and into the Army he would go.</P>
<P>THE Night before he &s;ign'd the Agreement for the Company, being in his Bed and fa&s;t a&s;leep, he &s;aw in a Dream his Father come to him in his Gown, and with a great Fur Cap on, &s;uch as he us'd to wear: And calling him by his Name, What is the Rea&s;on, &s;ays he, that you will not li&s;ten to the entreaties of your Mother not to go to the Wars; but an&s;wer her that I would not di&s;&s;uade you?

<P>TOO late! too late! <HI>&s;ays the Apparition,</HI> repeating the Words; then go on, and repent too late.</P>
<P>HE was not much affected with this Apparition, when he wak'd and found it was but a Dream; for Dreams, &s;aid he, are not to be heeded; &s;o he went on and bought the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A FEW Days after the Commi&s;&s;ion was bought, the Father appear'd again, not to him but to his Mother, in a Dream too as before; and taking notice to her, how his Son had rejected her Admonition, it added,</P>
<Q>YOUNG Heads are wilful: <HI>Robert</HI> will go in|to the Army; but tell him from me, he &s;hall never come back.</Q>
<P>ALL the&s;e Notices were of no force with this young Gentleman; but as he had re&s;olv'd, &s;o he pur&s;ued his Re&s;olution, and went into the Army; and two Battallions of that Regiment going into the Field that Summer, his Company was one, and &s;o he went abroad into <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>HE wanted no occa&s;ion to &s;how his Bravery, and in &s;everal warm Actions come off with applau&s;e; &s;o that he was far from being &s;u&s;pected of Cowardi&s;e: But one Day, and in the third Year of his Service, the Army was drawn out in order of Battel, the General having receiv'd certain Advice, that the E|nemy would come and attack them. As he &s;tood at the Head of his Company, he was &s;uddenly &s;eiz'd with a cold &s;hivering Fit, and it was &s;o violent

that &s;ome Officers who were near him, every one at their Po&s;t, perceiv'd it.</P>
<P>AS it was to no purpo&s;e for him to conceal it, he turn'd to his Lieutenant who &s;tood next to him, and from who&s;e Mouth I receiv'd the particular Account of it: I cannot imagine, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what is the occa&s;ion of this &s;haking Fit.</P>
<P>IT is your eagerne&s;s to fall on, <HI>&s;ays the Lieute|nant,</HI> I have often been &s;o, and begin to be &s;o now; I wi&s;h the <HI>French</HI> would come on, that we might have &s;omething to do.</P>
<P>IT continu'd about a quarter of an Hour, and the Enemy did come on as was expected; but the fight began upon the left, a good di&s;tance from them, &s;o that the whole left Wing was engag'd before they began.</P>
<P>WHILE this la&s;ted, the Lieutenant call'd to the Gentleman, Colonel, <HI>&s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he,</HI> how do you do? I hope your &s;hivering Fit is over.</P>
<P>NO, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> 'tis not over; but 'tis a lit|tle better.</P>
<P>IT will be all over pre&s;ently, <HI>&s;ays the Lieutenant.</HI></P>
<P>AY, &s;o 'twill, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> I am very ea&s;y, I know what 'twas now; and with that he call'd the Lieutenant to come to him for one Moment.</P>
<P>WHEN he came, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I know now what ail'd me, <HI>I am very ea&s;y,</HI> I have &s;een my Father; I &s;hall be kill'd the fir&s;t Volley; let my Mother know I told you this.</P>
<P>IN a few Minutes afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> this, a Body of the E|nemy advanc'd, and the very fir&s;t Volley the Regi|ment receiv'd was the fire of five Plottoons of Gre|nadiers, by which the Captain and &s;everal other Officers, be&s;ides private Men were kill'd, and the whole Brigade was &s;oon af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er put into Confu&s;ion; tho' being &s;upported by &s;ome Regiments of the &s;e|cond Line, they rallied again &s;oon after; the Cap|tain's Body was pre&s;ently recover'd; but he was

<P>IF all the Notices from the invi&s;ible World could have been of any U&s;e to him, or he had been to be wrought upon by Cautions and Advices, which nothing but a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Temper would have &s;o totally di&s;regarded, the Man had been &s;afe; But what can be expected when Men are as plainly inform'd of things, as by &s;uch Methods can be &s;up|pos'd rational, and will not take the Hint?</P>

<P>I KNOW &s;ome relate this as an Apparition to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in the open Day, but I under&s;tand it o|therwi&s;e, and that it was under&s;tood of the Genius of <HI>Italy,</HI> as they then call'd it, and that he had &s;uch a Vi&s;ion in his Sleep, which encourag'd him in his Attempt upon the Liberty of his Country; inti|mating, that the whole Country invited him, and that he might be &s;ure of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>I SHALL not run out here into the Account of Dreams; the Variety of them is Infinite, and, as I hinted before, few of them of Importance enough to de&s;erve any Regard; but &s;uch Dreams as nece&s;|&s;arily intimate an Apparition of Spirits, tho&s;e I think mu&s;t be Significant.</P>
<P>THE following is part Vi&s;ion, part Apparition, and &s;eems to make One be an Evidence of the O|ther, and therefore is very particularly to my Pur|po&s;e. <HI>T</HI>&mdash;<HI>H</HI>&mdash;a Gentleman of Fortune, elde&s;t Son of the Family, his Father a Baronet, and of an
<PB N="229" REF="242">
honourable Line, and then living, being a young Man, and a Man of Plea&s;ure, had an Intreague with a certain Lady, in which his younger Brother (of the two rather more Gay, and given that way than him&s;elf) was his Rival: The Lady was hand|&s;ome, and of no de&s;picable Fortune, but much in|feriour to the elde&s;t Son of the Family, who&s;e For|tune was near two thou&s;and Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> af|ter his Father Sir <HI>G</HI>&mdash;<HI>H</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>THE younger Gentleman was really in Love with the Lady, and inclin'd to marry her, if he could bring his Father to con&s;ent to it, and had two or three times &s;poken to the old Knight about it; nor was his Father much aver&s;e to it, only he thought her Fortune too &s;mall.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>G</HI>&mdash;told his Son, if he had been his Elde&s;t, he &s;hould have been ea&s;ier in the Propo&s;al, becau&s;e his Paternal E&s;tate being Free, and perfect|ly unincumber'd, he thought the Heir was not under that Nece&s;&s;ity of making his Fortune by a Wife; but that a younger Brother ought always to &s;eek a Fortune to mend his Circum&s;tances. He us'd to je&s;t with his Son, and tell him, it was this made him connive at his way of Life; that a younger Brother &s;hould be Hand&s;om, be a Scholar, Dre&s;s, and be Gay; the fir&s;t to recommend him to the Court, the &s;econd to recommend him to the La|dies; that the Heir having no need, was often left to be a Booby Knight, ju&s;t able to write his own Name, Halloo to his own Dogs, and ride the light Saddle; but as he had &s;eldom any Share of Brains, Nature wi&s;ely gave the Wit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o one, and the E&s;tate to the other; &s;o, &s;ays the Knight, your Bro|ther has his Affairs in a quite different Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uation.</P>
<P>THESE good-natur'd kind of Arguments the old Knight us'd with his younger Son, to per&s;uade him again&s;t marrying the Lady; but he did not ab|&s;olutely forbid him on pain of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, and
<PB N="230" REF="243">
of withdrawing his Hand from him, with re&s;pect to Money, &s;o that the young Gentleman kept the Lady Company openly; and though he had not yet made the Propo&s;al to her, yet did really de&s;ign it; I mean the honourable Propo&s;al, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of Marriage.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the E&s;quire, as they call'd him, kept her Company, on another and far wor&s;e Account, de&s;igning to make a Mi&s;tre&s;s of her, and not a Wife.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e differing Views, the Brothers often met at the Lady's Hou&s;e, that is to &s;ay, at her Aunt's where &s;he liv'd; for &s;he had no Father, and her Mother had chang'd Circum&s;tances, &s;o that her Daughter was as it were in her own Hands.</P>
<P>THE elder Brother had this Advantage in his Intere&s;t, <HI>(viz)</HI> that the Lady lov'd him, and would have been very well pleas'd if he had courted her for Marriage, but that was not his De&s;ign; &s;o that in a word, the Ca&s;e &s;tood thus, the younger Bro|ther lov'd the Lady, but the Lady lov'd the E&s;q;.</P>
<P>THE elder Brother laid Siege to her Virtue, and the younger laid Siege to her Affection; but, as I &s;aid, the Stream running in Favour of the elde&s;t, the Lady was in &s;ome Danger of &s;acri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">izing her Honour to her Pa&s;&s;ion, and the hone&s;t Preten&s;ions of the young Gentleman were in &s;ome Hazard of a Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen carry'd on their Affairs &s;epa|rately, and their own way; but were neither of them &s;o clo&s;e as to conceal it from one another that they had &s;ome De&s;igns, tho' they did not fully di&s;cover what their Preten&s;ions were; however as I have &s;aid that they often met at the Lady's Apartment, it could not be long before they came to a Con|ver&s;ation upon the Subject, and this unhappily em|broil'd them together at la&s;t, as you &s;hall &s;ee pre|&s;ently.</P>

<P>THESE two ra&s;h hot-headed young Fellows were carried into this Fit of Rage by the Violence rather of their fiery Spirits and Pa&s;&s;ions, than of their real J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alou&s;y, for they had &s;carce either of them begun to engage with the Lady one way or another; but being hot and heady, they rai&s;ed the Storm between them&s;elves, and the Match and the Tinder meeting, the Flame broke out by the meer Nature of the thing.</P>
<P>BUT my Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to moralize upon the Story, but to relate the Fact. The Challenge being given, they had no more to do but to meet, fight, play the Butcher upon one another, and leave the Con&s;equences to Time.</P>
<P>THE Father, the good old Knight, who was then living, could know nothing of what had pa&s;s'd between his Sons, for he was at that very time down at his Country Seat in <HI>W&mdash;&s;hire,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;ixty Miles from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>ON the Morrow early, according to Agreement, the Brothers prepar'd them&s;elves for the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and out they went, but by &s;everal Ways, to the Place appointed, their Lodgings being in different Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>THE younger Brother, who&s;e Blood it &s;eems was warme&s;t, was fir&s;t out, and it was &s;carce Day|light when he came within Sight of the Place ap|pointed; there he &s;aw his Brother, as he &s;uppo&s;ed him to be, walking ha&s;tily to and fro, as if he waited with Impatience for his coming.</P>

<P>YOU are mighty nimble with your Sword (&s;aid he again to him&s;elf) what, did you think I would not give you time to draw?

<P>HE was the more at a &s;tand, becau&s;e he &s;uppos'd his Father was, as is &s;aid above, at his Seat in the Country, above &s;ixty Miles off: However he was out of doubt when he not only &s;aw him nearer hand, but that his Father &s;poke to him?</P>

<P>THIS amus'd him more, and he knew not what to make of it; but he took up the Sword and went home, wondring at what the meaning of all this &s;hould be.</P>

<P>WHY that, indeed, makes me &s;o impatient to have it out: now I'll tell you one thing which allarms me a little too; I have &s;ent to Mr.&mdash;'s where you know my Father always lodges, and to the <HI>Black-Swan-Yard,</HI> where you know his Coach &s;tands, and they all &s;ay he is not in Town, and that he is to be in Town about &s;ix Weeks hence.</P>
<P>WHY that's extraordinary too, I confe&s;s, <HI>&s;ays the E&s;quire;</HI> I never thought of it, becau&s;e I ne|ver entertain'd any Jealou&s;y of this kind, it was quite out of my Head; but, upon my Word, you make me very unea&s;y about it now.</P>
<P>FOR my part, <HI>&s;ays his younger Brother,</HI> I would give any thing to come to a Certainty about it, I cou'd almo&s;t take my Hor&s;e, and go down on pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>I'LL go with you, with all my Heart, <HI>&s;ays the E&s;quire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="258">
TO bring the Matter to a conclu&s;ion, the two Brothers agreed, and they went both away to &s;ee their Father. The very Day they took Hor&s;e to go down, but &s;ome Hours after they were gone, a Letter came in to the elder Brother's Hou&s;e from their Father; the Contents of which I &s;hall take Notice of pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t I am to ob&s;erve that when they came to their Father they found him at home, and ve|ry ill, nor had he been from home; and was great|ly concern'd for the Safety of his Sons, upon the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Night before he wrote the Letter, &s;poken of above, he was &s;urpriz'd in his Sleep with a Dream, or rather a Vi&s;ion, that his two Sons had fallen out about a Mi&s;tre&s;s; that they had Quar|rell'd to that degree, that they had challeng'd one another, and were gone out into the Fields to fight; but that &s;ome body had given him Notice of it, and that he had got up in the Morning by four a Clock to meet and prevent them.</P>
<P>UPON this Dream he awak'd in great Di&s;order and Terror; however finding it but a Dream he had compos'd his Mind, and gotten to &s;leep again: but that he dream'd it again in &s;o lively a man|ner, that he was forc'd to call up his Man that waited on him to &s;it up the re&s;t of the Night with him; and he was frighted, and much out of order with the Fright.</P>
<P>That, in Con&s;equence of this Dream, he had &s;ent a Servant up Expre&s;s, with Orders to ride Night and Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, to enquire how his Sons did, and to bring him word if there had been any &s;uch breach among them; and earne&s;tly to pre&s;s them, if &s;uch a breach had been, that they would con&s;ent to let him mediate between them, that it might go no farther 'till he could come up, that &s;o he might put an end to their Re&s;entments, and make Peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="245" REF="259">
among them, according to his Dreams: and this was the Letter, mention'd above, that came to Hand in a few Hours after they were &s;et out.</P>
<P>IT cannot be doubted but it was very con|founding to his Sons to hear the Account their Father gave them of his Dream, or Vi&s;ion rather, about their Quarrel; and it was equally amazing to &s;ee it confirm'd by all the true Particulars; al&s;o that the old Gentleman, to be &s;ure, had been &s;o far from being at <HI>London,</HI> that he had &s;carce been a whole Day off from his Bed.</P>
<P>THEY conferr'd together &s;eriou&s;ly upon the private Que&s;tion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> whether they &s;hould tell their Father the Story of their Quarrel, but e&s;pecially of their &s;eeing him &s;everally, and his really parting them, or preventing their fight|ing.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, they concluded not to let their Father know of his Likene&s;s (as they call'd it) appearing to them, le&s;t it might di&s;quiet him too much; and for the re&s;t, as they were perfectly re|concil'd again, they &s;aid there was no manner of Occa&s;ion to mention it at all; &s;o they only paid their Compliment as a Vi&s;it of Duty, to &s;ee how he did, and to ask his Ble&s;&s;ing; <HI>Will</HI> having told them that he was out of Order: and as for his Letter, they could happily tell him they had not &s;een it.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this Re&s;olution they per|form'd the Ceremony of Vi&s;iting their Father, and made ha&s;te away again, that they might conver&s;e the more freely about this &s;trange Conjunction of Circum&s;tances, which had in it &s;o many things &s;urprizing to their Thoughts, and even to their Un|der&s;tandings; for they knew not what to make of it, nor, indeed, could they re&s;olve it into any thing but this, which is to my purpo&s;e exactly, and which is the rea&s;on of my mentioning the whole
<PB N="246" REF="260">
Story, namely, that here was a double Apparition within the compa&s;s of our propos'd Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P N="1">1. HERE was the Apparition of the living Per|&s;on of their Father, without his participation in the Action; his Face, Voice, and, perhaps, Habit was a&s;&s;um'd, and yet he him&s;elf knew nothing of the Matter, was not in the lea&s;t concerned in it, or acquainted with it.</P>
<P N="2">2. HERE was an Apparition to the Father in Dream; 'twas a plain Vi&s;ion, the thing that was true in Fact was reveal'd to him in his Sleep, which is the very Subject I am now &s;peaking of. The Sons were repre&s;ented, or appear'd to him, Quar|relling, and in a &s;tate of Feud, as they really were, and yet neither of them knew any thing of the Matter.</P>
<P>FROM hence (&s;uppo&s;ing the Reality of the Story) it nece&s;&s;arily follows that a Spirit or invi&s;ible Be|ing, let it be call'd what we plea&s;e, may take upon it the Shape, Face, Voice of any living Per&s;on, whom it plea&s;es to repre&s;ent, without the Knowledge, Con&s;ent, or Concurrence of the Per&s;on &s;o repre|&s;ented, in any manner what&s;oever.</P>
<P>AND from hence al&s;o it is evident that Dreams are &s;ometimes to be call'd, and really are, Appariti|ons, as much as tho&s;e other vi&s;ible Apparitions which are &s;een when we are (as we call it) broad awake; that Apparition is to the Eyes of the Soul, and as it is &s;o, it may be &s;een as well &s;leeping as waking, for the Imagination &s;leeps not: the Soul cea&s;es in|deed to act organically, but it cea&s;es not to act as a Soul, and in a &s;pirituous Manner, and con&s;e|quently can act upon &s;pirituous Objects; and that as well in Sleep as at any other time.</P>

<P>A CERTAIN Lady of good Figure and &s;ome Quality, had a terrible Quarrel with her Husband upon the great and critical Points of Virtue and Honour; he was a Gentleman of publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and pa&s;s'd for a Man of Sen&s;e; but had that par|ticular Infirmity, which with me will always pa&s;s for a deficiency in the Under&s;tanding; I mean to be jealous of his Wife, and yet to be able to fix nothing upon her, no not &s;o much as a ju&s;t blot upon her Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>'TIS very hard for a Man to be Fool enough to di&s;quiet him&s;elf on &s;uch an Account, and not be Knave enough to make it unea&s;y to his Wife too; I &s;ay Knave, becau&s;e where there is no ju&s;t cau&s;e of Reproach, he cannot be an hone&s;t Man that loads his Wife with the Scandal of it.</P>
<P>HE had thought fit to u&s;e her very ill upon this Subject many times, with no manner of Foun|dation, nay, indeed, not &s;o much as a pretence for it, except what was to be fetch'd from his own bewildred Imagination; and he gave him&s;elf up &s;o much to his Jealou&s;y, without grounds, that his Wife was oblig'd to lay her Condition before &s;ome of her Relations, who took upon them to talk with him about it.</P>
<P>THIS talking with him had a wor&s;e Effect than was expected, for the Man was &s;o far from being influenced by the friendly Expo&s;tulations of his Wife's Kindred, that he grew rude and abu&s;ive to them; and if any one of them &s;poke a little war|mer than ordinary in her favour, he turn'd it pre&s;ently
<PB N="248" REF="262">
upon that Per&s;on, as if he had been the Man, and had been naught with her; and yet when one of them challeng'd him to give any one In&s;tance of his Wife's Conduct, or of any Per&s;on's a&s;&s;ociating with her in a manner as &s;hou'd give an hone&s;t Man the lea&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;picion, he could not a&s;&s;ign the lea&s;t Rea&s;on; but as is mo&s;t true in or|dinary, that tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t Jealous have oftentimes the lea&s;t Cau&s;e for it, &s;o it was here; yet notwith&s;tanding all the Expo&s;tulations that were, or could be u&s;ed with him, the coole&s;t Rea|&s;onings and mo&s;t friendly Per&s;ua&s;ions, he continued to u&s;e his Wife &s;o ill, that her Friends began to think it nece&s;&s;ary to part them.</P>
<P>THE Lady, a Woman of Piety as well as Vir|tue, tho' griev'd heartily with the ill U&s;age, and particularly as it reproach'd her Virtue, yet was loath to unhinge her Family and &s;eparate from her Husband, having al&s;o two Children which &s;he could not part with, her Affection not &s;uffering her to leave them to want the Care and Conduct of a Mother; &s;o &s;he cho&s;e rather to bear his daily ill U&s;age of her, than to leave her Family.</P>
<P>BUT he carried the Bruiti&s;h Part &s;o far at length, that not content to u&s;e her in the mo&s;t &s;candalous manner with his Tongue, he fell upon her with his Hands, and two or three times, in his Rage, abus'd her very much: &s;he conceal'd this part (for his &s;ake) as much as &s;he could, and endeavour'd to prevent its being known.</P>
<P>BUT he took care to expo&s;e him&s;elf in it up|on many Occa&s;ions, and particularly by affronting a Gentleman of his own Acquaintance, and &s;ome Relation to him too: the Ca&s;e was thus; He fell to charging his Wife with di&s;hone&s;ty in his or|dinary Di&s;cour&s;e, and before Strangers; upon which the Gentleman &s;aid, Fye, Cou&s;in, really I believe you wrong her, at lea&s;t you &s;hould be very &s;ure

<P>AT this he flew out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, D&mdash;her, he was &s;atisfy'd &s;he was a Whore.</P>

<P>WHAT Su&s;picion, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> did I ever give you of it? I was never in your Wife's Com|pany in my Life, but when you were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>'TIS no matter for that, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you were not guilty, why &s;hould you concern your&s;elf to vindicate her?</P>

<P>HIS Smiling provok'd him, and he gave the Gentleman the Lie, and added &s;ome very &s;currilous Language to it, &s;uch as might be expected from a Mad-man, a Man out of him&s;elf; not by Luna|cy, as a Di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mper, but by that wor&s;e Frenzy, call'd groundle&s;s Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>AS giving the Lie is the la&s;t Injury one Man can do to another with his Tongue, it &s;o provok'd his Cou&s;in, that &s;corning to draw his Sword up|on him, he corrected him heartily for it with his Cane, as he de&s;erv'd; and he again, like a true Coward,

(when they were go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">) reveng'd him&s;elf upon hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wife; for he abus'd her again in a bruiti&s;h and bar|barous Manner: nor did it pacify him at all that he vented his Rage thus upon his Wife at that time; but he continued it upon every Occa&s;ion of his being harra&s;s'd with his own Jealou&s;y: and when-ever he abus'd his Wife after that time, he upbraided her with this Gentleman, and with her &s;till keeping him Company; tho', as it appear'd afterwards, the Gen|tleman was not in <HI>England,</HI> nor had been for &s;eve|ral Months.</P>
<P>IT happened one time in particular, that coming home, not at all in Drink, but very much out of Humour, and, as it &s;eem'd, provok'd, tho' it could not be &s;o much as gue&s;s'd at, what the Rea&s;on was, he pick'd a Quarrel with his Wife, and without any other Provocation than what was to be found in his own want of Temper, fell foul of her in a mo&s;t un|merciful manner; and had not Help been fetch'd in 'twas fear'd he would have murther'd her. In a Word, Neighbours coming in to her re&s;cue, &s;aved her from farther Mi&s;chief; yet before them all he bad her go out of the Hou&s;e, and forbid her com|ing any more within his Doors.</P>
<P>THE Lady could not now avoid what &s;he had &s;o long been per&s;uaded to before; &s;o taking &s;ome Cloaths, and her own Jewels, which &s;he brought to him, &s;he withdrew the &s;ame Evening to her own Brother's Hou&s;e, taking &s;ufficient Witne&s;s of the occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>BUT to bring this Story nearer to the Ca&s;e in Hand: The Gentleman whom he had thus ill us'd, had (on &s;ome occa&s;ions of his own) been oblig'd a|bout five Months before this la&s;t Broil to go over to <HI>Germany;</HI> and as he went from <HI>England</HI> by Sea and landed at <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mburgh,</HI> he travell'd from <HI>Ham|burgh</HI> up to <HI>Magdeburgh,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Leip|&s;ick</HI> in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="265">
AS he was &s;itting alone in a Summer-Hou&s;e as we call it, or <HI>Garden-Hou&s;e,</HI> as they more properly call it there, belonging to a Burgher of <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and reading a Book to divert him&s;elf, being in the heat of the Day, and a little after Dinner; he dropt a&s;leep, and dream'd that a Lady was come from <HI>England</HI> to &s;peak with him, and was in the Hou&s;e waiting for him.</P>
<P>UPON this Dream, and being not very &s;ound a&s;leep, only leaning his Head on his Hand as he was reading, he wak'd; and as &s;oon as he wak'd he &s;tarted up, and intended to go into the Hou&s;e to &s;ee who it &s;hould be, when immediately he &s;ees a Lady in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> dre&s;s coming up the Garden towards the Summer-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>HE did not know her at fir&s;t; but when &s;he came nearer &s;he &s;poke to him; he calling her by her Name, would have &s;aluted her; but &s;he &s;eem'd to decline it, and &s;tepping back, &s;aid, You and I, Sir, have been &s;ufficiently abus'd upon that Head already; and I come to you for Ju&s;tice. I am ill us'd, and in danger of being murther'd every Day by my cruel Husband on your Account, and am at la&s;t turn'd out of Doors.</P>
<P>ALAS! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Madam, he is a Bruti&s;h Man, and I am very &s;orry; but what can I do for you?</P>
<P>YOU know my Innocence, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> as far as re|lates to your&s;elf; do me ju&s;tice, I ask no more: and that moment &s;he di&s;appear'd.</P>
<P>HE was extremely &s;urpriz'd, as he might well be indeed; and the more, becau&s;e he had not the lea&s;t notion of its being an Apparition, no more had the Burgher's Servant who let her in at the Door, and waited on her up the Garden to the Summer-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>HE went immediately back into the Hou&s;e, and enquir'd who let the Lady into the Hou&s;e; and the Servant that had u&s;her'd her up the Walk in
<PB N="252" REF="266">
the Garden told him he did; and al&s;o that he had that Minute let her out again; but looking out into the Street, nothing of her could be &s;een again, or did he ever &s;ee or hear any more of her in that manner.</P>
<P>WHILE this pa&s;s'd, the Lady liv'd a very me|lancholly retir'd Life in her Brother's Family, &s;eeing no Company, and &s;pending her time in a mo&s;t un|comfortable Solitude; e&s;pecially grieved for the Re|proach &s;o cau&s;ele&s;ly rais'd upon her Character, and having nothing to comfort her but the knowledge of her own Innocence; that which we call the Comfort of a good Con&s;cience: which, as the World goes now, I mu&s;t be cautious how I lay too much &s;tre&s;s upon, or moralize too much upon, le&s;t I &s;hould be call'd Religious and Grave, which is as much as to &s;ay Mad.</P>
<P>THIS Separation continu'd &s;ome time; all en|deavours to bring it to a Reconciliation had been try'd, but prov'd ineffectual; the Husband continu|ing in&s;olently abu&s;ive to his Wife; and his Wife (Things being carry'd to &s;uch a height) in&s;i&s;ting upon a Reparation of the Injury offer'd to her Re|putation, by having either the Facts prov'd, or a due Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion a&s;&s;igned. Between both, a Reconciliation &s;eem'd impracticable, and Friends on both &s;ides having done their utmo&s;t, began to give it over.</P>
<P>BUT, to the agreeable &s;urprize of all that wi&s;h'd well to the Family, the Husband comes one Morn|ing to his Wife's Brother all alone, and ask'd to &s;peak with his Wife.</P>
<P>HER Brother was a litttle doubtful at fir&s;t what An&s;wer to give him; and particularly was afraid to bring his Si&s;ter forth to him, not knowing what the <HI>Devil</HI> and an exa&s;perated Temper might prompt him to; and he perceiving it, &s;aid, with a quite differing Tone from what he us'd to talk with,

You need not be afraid, Brother, to let me &s;ee my Wife, tho' indeed I have given you all Cau&s;e e|nough to be unea&s;y; but I a&s;&s;ure you I will &s;oon &s;atisfy you that I do not come to do her any harm, but ju&s;t the contrary: I come to put an end to all this wicked Breach, and that in a manner as &s;hall be to your Satisfaction, and hers too; and I am very willing you &s;hall be pre&s;ent when I &s;peak to her, for I de&s;ire you &s;hould hear what I have to &s;ay.</P>
<P>HE &s;poke it with &s;uch an apparent Alteration in his Temper, that it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that he was quite another Man, and that there was no hazard in letting him &s;ee her: &s;o he went and acquainted his Wife with what had pa&s;s'd; who tho' &s;he was a little afraid at fir&s;t, yet upon her Brother's per&s;ua|&s;ions came down, and her Brother led her into the Room to him, in his Hand.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as he &s;aw his Wife, he run to her, and took her in his Arms and ki&s;s'd her, holding her fa&s;t; but was not able to &s;peak a word for &s;ome time.

it, that I did you wrong, and that you gave me no ju&s;t occa&s;ion for what has pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>HE &s;poke this with &s;o much Affection, and even with Tears in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eyes, that he forc'd Tears not from his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e only, but from her Brother too, and another Relation of hers that was in the Room with them. In a word, the Reconciliation was made in a few Minutes; for he not only comply'd with any thing his Wife or her Brother de&s;ir'd, but even more than they ask'd; and when they propos'd that, to prevent Mi&s;takes afterwards, he would con&s;ent they &s;hould put into Writing what they de&s;ir'd, and what he had &s;aid to her, He call'd for a Pen and Ink, and drew it out him&s;elf in the fulle&s;t Terms imaginable, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as has been related, and fuller indeed than they could de&s;ire, and &s;et his Hand to it, de&s;iring the Brother and the other Relation to be Witne&s;&s;es of it, and then gave it to his Wife.</P>
<P>UPON this his Wife with a glad Heart went home that very Night along with him, her Bro|ther and the other Relation being invited to go al&s;o, which they did; where he entertain'd them very kindly at Supper, which fini&s;h'd the Recon|ciliation, and they liv'd very comfortably together ever after.</P>
<P>BUT now for the Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ion of all this; and whence this &s;trange Alteration proceeded: To this purpo&s;e, you are to under&s;tand that one Evening this Gentleman being either in his Cham|ber, or &s;ome other Room in his Hou&s;e, (the Story is not particular in that part) he &s;ees his Cou&s;in, who had differ'd with him about his Wife, come into the Room, and &s;ays to him, Cou&s;in, I am very &s;orry to hear you have continu'd to u&s;e your Wife ill, and at la&s;t have turn'd her away upon my Ac|count.

<P>HE gave him no time for a Reply, but imme|diately di&s;appear'd.

<P>I HAVE not been able to dive &s;o far into this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tory, as to &s;ay, that they were ever enquired of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fterward, whether they were acquainted with the Circum&s;tances or no; but I am indifferent as to that
<PB N="256" REF="270">
Point, it is out of Que&s;tion with me, that they might not be any way concern'd in the thing it &s;elf, and yet that it might be really an Apparition of the Per&s;ons, their Faces, Voices, Cloaths, and all the needful Apparatus fit for the Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE are many In&s;tances of like kind with this, and I have a very particular Relation by me of a Per&s;on who in Apparition told a Friend of his, of the Fire of <HI>London,</HI> two Months before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t happen'd, mention'd the manner of the Confl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gra|tion, how it would begin in the Heart of the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, and would burn Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and lay the City level with the Ground; to u&s;e the very words.</P>
<P>HE happen'd not to tell the Place exactly where it was to have been done; if he had, he might have been afterwards brought into Trouble, by the un|advi&s;ed relating the Particulars; for his Friend be|lieved he really &s;aw him; and not that it was an Ap|parition: But it &s;eems he made a long Religious Excur&s;ion upon the di&s;mal Condition of the Citi|zens, and how their Pride would be brought low; how their Glory would be laid in the Du&s;t; and how it was all to be look'd upon as a Blow upon them for their Luxury, and for their publick Sins; and &s;o &s;eem'd to preach pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">much: And you know if Spirits from the other World were to preach, &s;ome People have &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to that dull heavy Bu&s;ine&s;s, as they call it, that they would give very little heed to it. I &s;ay, the Apparition &s;eem'd to preach pretty much upon the Subject, and &s;o the Friend began to be weary of the Di&s;cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, and put him off to &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT which &s;eems Particular in this Story, and which (had I room here) would take up &s;ome time to Di&s;cour&s;e upon at large, is, that the Apparition went off in Form, not di&s;covering it &s;elf &s;o much as to be an Apparition; but came in at the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r, was let in by a Servant in the u&s;ual manner, aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r

knocking at the Door, and was carry'd into the Parlor among the Family; that it di&s;cours'd of other Matters al&s;o; as of the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, and the bloody Engagement at Sea: I do not remember exactly, whether it &s;aid a bloody Engagement had been, or would be; but I think it was Engage|ment that had lately been.</P>
<P>THAT there were &s;everal other Tran&s;itions in their Di&s;cour&s;e, from one Article of publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to another; and at la&s;t to that of the Fire of <HI>London:</HI> The Gentleman who it was di&s;cours'd to &s;eem'd not to be much concern'd at the Prediction about the Fire, looking upon it as a piece of gue&s;s|work, and that his Friend &s;poke it as of a thing which he fear'd, rather than as a thing he foretold, and pretended to know of: But after the Terrible Conflagration had happen'd, and that the City was indeed laid low from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t, as had been mention'd, then all the Particulars came into his Mind with &s;ome weight, and &s;ome unu&s;ual reflection; for the Circum&s;tances were too evident to be &s;lightly thought of.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it pa&s;s'd over in the ordinary way, with a little kind of wonder; and it was &s;trange that Mr. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;&s;hould be able to talk &s;o; and &s;ure Mr. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;deals with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and the like; whereas all this while Mr. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;knew nothing of the Story; and whatever Hand it was, and for whatever kind purpo&s;es, no notice was taken of it, and Mr. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;had &s;o little knowledge of it him&s;elf that his own Hou&s;e was burnt down in the gene|ral di&s;a&s;ter, and he had hardly time to &s;ave one quarter part of his Goods.</P>
<P>IT might indeed be form'd here as an Objection again&s;t this Notion, of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ts from the In&s;ivi|ble World, and their concerni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">g them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ves in giving Notices of appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ching Mi&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s, <HI>viz.</HI> That they do not concern them&s;elves to give &s;uch Notices in

<P>THIS is what I may take notice of again, in its proper place; but at pre&s;ent I am rather ob|&s;erving to you what is, than the Rea&s;on of its being &s;o: The ways and works of Providence are Sove|reign and Superiour; the Manner conceal'd, and be|yond our Under&s;tandings and Rea&s;on; not always vi&s;ible to us; and yet its Proceedings not the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> ju&s;t, or the le&s;s to be accounted for in them&s;elves; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be always able to account for them to our &s;elves.

<P>IT is certain the approach of that Terrible Fire, the like of which was never known in this part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> World, was not di&s;cover'd from the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ible World; at lea&s;t but to very few: an evident token that de|parted Souls knew nothing of it, or, if they did<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

had no Power to come hither, and give notice of it; if they had, what Numbers of Predictions, Forebodings and Apparitions would there have been in the City for &s;ome Months before!</P>
<P><HI>BUT are we not an&s;wer'd by the Scripture, and might we not reply in the Language of our Saviour &s;peaking of the general Deluge,</HI> Matt. <HI>xxiv. 38, 39.</HI> For as in the days that were before the flood, they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, until the day that <HI>Noe</HI> entred into the Ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of Man be?</P>
<P>JUST &s;o likewi&s;e was it at the time of the Fire of <HI>London:</HI> 'tis &s;aid indeed, with &s;ome Remark, that it was not a Wedding Night to many, if to any one Couple in the City; becau&s;e the Fire beginning on the <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, very few, if any, are &s;aid to be marry'd of a <HI>Saturday;</HI> but as it was a mighty Cu|&s;tom in tho&s;e Days to marry on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> &s;o there were a great many Weddings appointed for the next Morning, which were hinder'd without any forebodings or foreknowledge; and that which was infinitely wor&s;e, many Women in Travel that very Night, were, as it was reported, forc'd to be carry'd out of their Chambers in the very Article of Child-Birth, and &s;ome as I have heard were de|liver'd in the very Pa&s;&s;age from one Hou&s;e to ano|ther: Others, not thinking the Fire would follow &s;o fa&s;t, having remov'd but a little way, their extremity being great, were oblig'd to be remov'd again; yet we find no notice of any of the&s;e things given in the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>

ought to have an equal Claim to: But 'tis a Pro|po&s;ition that &s;uch Apparitions there are, and that therefore there are certain Agents &s;o appointed to appear.</P>
<P>WE have like Accounts to the&s;e at the time of the great Ma&s;&s;acre at <HI>Paris;</HI> a critical Juncture, in which the Rage of Hell &s;eem'd to be carry'd to a terrible Height, and when innocent Blood lay ready to be &s;pilt in a terrible manner; the Unguar|ded Prote&s;tants having no Means to avoid the Mi&s;|chiefs that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tended them, and no Strength to re&s;i&s;t the Power of the Cut-throat Armies which &s;ur|rounded them; &s;o they had no Intimations from the invi&s;ible World to a&s;&s;i&s;t their E&s;cape.</P>
<P>BUT what does this amount to, any more than the like Ca&s;es may argue in a thou&s;and Calami|ties and Di&s;a&s;ters which have befallen Mankind be|fore? Nay, it confirms the grand Truth which I have in&s;i&s;ted on; namely, that Souls departed know not any thing, and can communicate nothing, tho' unembody'd Spirit may.</P>
<P>FOR could the departed Souls of deceas'd Relati|ons have known that their Fathers, or Children, or Brothers, or Relicts, &amp;c. were the next Day to have been murther'd, can we doubt but they would have given them all the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tice that it was in their Power to do, and at lea&s;t have alarm'd them &s;o, as to put them upon their Gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and give them an Oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">unity to die like Hero's, as many of them were? and as they did not do thus, I think, without Inju&s;tice, or Pre&s;umption, we may con|clude they cannot; they could not then, neither can others do the like now.</P>
<P>AND yet as to &s;uch Notices as the Inhabitants of the invi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">le World were allow'd to make, I believe they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> not without them at that time, tho' it was not thought fit by the Appointment of Heaven to have the wicked Re&s;olution of Murther

<P>THE Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times are full of the &s;ecret Warnings and Notices then given by the kind Apparitions of tho&s;e invi&s;ible Agents (whoever they are) in Dream. The Admiral <HI>Coligni</HI> had no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s than three particular Notices given him by Dreams, that his Life was in danger, and that he would be murther'd if he &s;tay'd in <HI>Paris;</HI> an Expre&s;s was &s;ent him from the Count <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, at <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">umur,</HI> to make his E&s;cape and flee for his Life before it was too late; nay, it was even &s;aid that the King of <HI>Navarr,</HI> who was afterwards <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. &s;ent a private Me&s;&s;age to him to be gone, and if he &s;taid one Night longer he would find it impo&s;&s;ible: But, as they &s;aid afterwards, his Hour was come, and his Fate was det<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rmin'd; and he was de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f to his Friends, for &s;everal others who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d a J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alou&s;y of his Danger, gave him like War<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gs, but it was all in vain, he was deaf and indolent to his own Safety.</P>
<P>SOME others who were more obedient to the heavenly Vi&s;ion, more toucht then with the Sen&s;e of their Danger, as the Count <HI>de Montgomery,</HI> the <HI>Vidame</HI> of <HI>Chartres, de Caver&s;ac,</HI> and others, too many to name; and who had &s;everally, and &s;ome of them jointly, timely Warning of their Danger, mounted their Hor&s;es, and fled the very Night b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fore, and preventing the vigilance of their Pur&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de their E&s;cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

he was gone, than before; for he did not give her time before, to reflect upon the Particulars he mention'd to her, but following one thing with another, he found her enough to do to take in the heads of Things in the gro&s;s.</P>

<P>WHEN &s;he came to&mdash;&s;he found her Mi|&s;tre&s;s thrown down upon the Bed very ill, and &s;o ill, that at fir&s;t they told her &s;he could not &s;peak with her.

<P>AS &s;oon as the Door was &s;hut, her Lady bur&s;t out into Tears again, for &s;he had been crying ve|hemently before. O <HI>Mary, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have had a dreadful Vi&s;it this Afternoon, here has been your Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter! Why, Madam, that's impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>NAY, it has been your Ma&s;ter to be &s;ure, or the <HI>Devil</HI> in his Likene&s;s.</P>
<P>IN a word, 'tis certain it was her Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">band in Apparition, or an Apparition of her Husband, and he talk'd very warmly and clo&s;ely to her, and told her his E&s;tate would not &s;upport her expen&s;ive way of Living, and that &s;he would bring her &s;elf
<PB N="271" REF="285">
to Mi&s;ery and Poverty; and a great deal more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, as he had &s;aid to <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MARY</HI> immediately ask'd her Lady&s;hip, what manner he appear'd in; and by the De&s;cription that her Mi&s;tre&s;s gave, it was exactly the &s;ame Figure that came to her, and de&s;ired to &s;ee the Lodgings; &s;o <HI>Mary</HI> gave her Lady a particular Relation of what happen'd to her al&s;o, and of the Me&s;&s;age &s;he was charg'd to deliver.</P>
<P>WHAT follow'd upon this Alarm, and how the Lady was reduced, and obliged to &s;ell her fine Fur|niture and Equipage, and came to very low Cir|cum&s;tances, tho' it was a part of the Story, is not &s;o much to my Purpo&s;e in the Relation. But what is remarkable to the Ca&s;e in hand is, that they alledge, that ju&s;t at this Juncture Sir <HI>J</HI>&mdash;<HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>ne,</HI> the Lady's Husband, died in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e by his Death her Supplies were immediately &s;topped, and that was the Occa&s;ion of her being reduced &s;o &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>NOW the Apparition, and its appearing in the Shape or Figure of the Husband, his warning her of her approaching Circum&s;tances, and moving her to abate her expen&s;ive way of Living, and the like, all this is agreeable to the Opinion I have already given, that good Spirits may be allowed to a&s;&s;ume humane Shape, and the Shape of any particular Per&s;on, whether the Per&s;on be dead or living; and may appear to us, to caution us in our wrong Mea&s;ures, to warn us again&s;t impending Mi&s;chiefs, and to direct us in Difficulties. And how merciful is it to Mankind, that there are &s;uch kind Moni|tors at hand, at any time, for our good!</P>
<P>BUT that this mu&s;t be ju&s;t in the Article of Death, ju&s;t when the Per&s;on was dying, and the Soul departing; as if the Soul could &s;tay in its Pa&s;&s;age, between Life, and the eternal State, to call at this, or that Place, and deliver a Me&s;&s;age:
<PB N="272" REF="286">
For Example; if it was to be carry'd by the An|gels into <HI>Abrabam</HI>'s Bo&s;om, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Angels would go about with it from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> to give it leave to &s;peak with his Wife, before its Tran&s;lation, before tho&s;e &s;wift Me&s;&s;en|gers perform'd their Task; nay that he mu&s;t &s;top at the <HI>London</HI> Hou&s;e, a&s;&s;ume a Shape for that Pur|po&s;e, talk about the mo&s;t frivolous things with <HI>Mary</HI> the Servant Maid, and then go with another formal Errand to&mdash;to his Wife, all this in his Journey; and having di&s;patch'd the&s;e more weighty Affairs, then go on for Heaven afterwards.</P>
<P>THIS, I &s;ay, has to me no Con&s;i&s;tency in it, no Coherence, it does not hang together in my Opi|nion at all, nor can I make any common Sen&s;e of it; no, not if I was to come to the old poetick Ficti|ons of <HI>Charon</HI> and his Ferry-Boat; even the old Ferry-Man would not have &s;tept out of his Way, upon any &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT might be done by the Agency of tho&s;e Spirits, appointed by the Great Lord of all Spirit, to attend for the good of his Creatures, I have not the lea&s;t Objection again&s;t; but that the Soul of the Decea&s;ed, or Departed, can come of this Errand it &s;elf, that I deny, and mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that there is neither Rea&s;on or Religion in it, 'tis founded wholly in the Imagination; and tho' the Imagina|tion may not in this Ca&s;e form the Apparition, yet 'tis evident the Imagina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion only appropriates it to the Per&s;on, that is, to the Soul of the Per&s;on, who has really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o Share in the Operation.</P>
<P>UPON this Foundation likewi&s;e &s;tands the old Heathen Notion, taken from the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e of <HI>Achilles</HI> and his Friend <HI>Patr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">lus,</HI> that the Soul of the De|cea&s;ed cannot be at Re&s;t, 'till he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s come and given Notice of &s;uch and &s;uch things; that Ju&s;tice be done to &s;uch and &s;uch injur'd Per&s;ons; and Money, &s;o and &s;o appropriated, be regularly di&s;po&s;ed, and the

Will of the Decea&s;ed punctually performed: The&s;e I take not to be imaginary but fictitious, and made or &s;upplyed out of the Invention of the Relator, in order to di&s;h up the Story.</P>
<P>AND this makes the Story of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Father, of which mention has been made already, be liable to &s;o many Exceptions: That his Father could not re&s;t, or his Soul could not be at re&s;t, becau&s;e of the wicked Life his Son <HI>George</HI> liv'd at Court; That part mu&s;t certainly be added by &s;ome of the very very many Relators, or who have call'd them&s;elves Relators of that Story; and my Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> who &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t exact and judicious in the putting the whole Story together, has none of that Pa&s;&s;age in his Ac|count of it, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>UPON what Religious Foundation can we &s;ug|ge&s;t, that the Sins of the Children &s;hould di&s;quiet the Fathers in their Graves, or that the Souls de|parted can receive any Impre&s;&s;ion from the Beha|viour of tho&s;e in Life, &s;ub&s;equent to any Action tho&s;e Souls departed have been concern'd in?</P>
<P>THAT they may be affected in a Future State with the Wickedne&s;s and Offences committed in their pa&s;t Life, that I will not doubt; tho' even not that in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;end them back hither upon any Errand about it; for all is irre|trievable; as there is no Repentance, &s;o no Repa|ration, there is neither <HI>Work nor Invention in the Grave,</HI> whither we are all going. The Soul may be in a State of Self-Reflection and Reproach; but not in a State of Reaction, no recovering for our &s;elves, nor concern for others; 'tis all out of the Que&s;tion, and all the Notices from the other &s;ide of the Curtain come from other Hands, who&s;e Name &s;oever they may &s;peak in, or who&s;e Shape &s;oever they may a&s;&s;ume.</P>

I AM forc'd, how reluctant &s;oever, to talk Scrip|ture to my Readers, upon this nice part of the Subject; whether they will lay any weight upon it or no, be that to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN INSIST upon it, that the Souls of the dead can make no Vi&s;its hither when once they are re|moved; that when they are unembodied, di&s;rob'd of Fle&s;h and Blood, they have no more concern with or about us; &s;o as either to di&s;turb their Re&s;t or ours; and this is plain to me, not only from the Nature of the thing, from Rea&s;on and Ob&s;ervati|on; but from the Scripture. <HI>Eccl.</HI> ix. 5. <HI>For the living know that they &s;hall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a Reward, for the memory of them is fotgotten.</HI> This latter part re|lates to their having any Reward or Concern in things here of this Life, no more Reward or Be|nefit or Share of things here: But look into the next words, ver. 6. <HI>Al&s;o their love, and their hatred, and their envy is now peri&s;hed; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT can be plainer than this, if Scripture be of any moment among us? if not, I can &s;ay nothing to that.

<P>THE abridg'd Story is this. In the Year 1662, an Apparition meets one <HI>Francis Taverner</HI> on the Highway; the Man having Courage to &s;peak to it, asks it what he is? and the Apparition tells him he is <HI>James Haddock,</HI> and gives him &s;everal Tokens to remember him by, which <HI>Taverner</HI> al&s;o calling to mind owns them; and then boldly demands of the Apparition what bu&s;ine&s;s he had with him;
<PB N="276" REF="290">
the Apparition did not tell his Bu&s;ine&s;s that Night; but would have had <HI>Taverner</HI> rode back his way with him, and he would tell him his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which <HI>Taverner</HI> refus'd, as well he might; and that part indeed &s;eems the only improbable part of the Story.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the next Night the Apparition comes to him again, and then tells him the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which was to de&s;ire him to go to his Wife, who&s;e Maiden Name was <HI>Eleanor Wel&s;h;</HI> but was then marry'd again to one <HI>Davis,</HI> which <HI>Davis</HI> with-held the Lea&s;e from the Orphan, <HI>Haddock</HI>'s Son, and tell her &s;he &s;hould cau&s;e Ju&s;tice to be done to the Child.</P>
<P><HI>TAVERNER</HI> neglected to perform this Er|rand, and was &s;o continually follow'd by the Ap|parition, that it was exceeding terrible to him; and at la&s;t it threaten'd to tear him in Peices, if he did not go of his Errand.</P>
<P>UPON this he goes and delivers the Me&s;&s;age to the Woman, who it &s;eems took but &s;mall Notice of it; and then the Apparition came again, and told him he mu&s;t go to his Executor, and do the &s;ame Errand; which he was it &s;eems afraid to do, for fear of <HI>Davis;</HI> but the Apparition threaten'd <HI>Davis</HI> if he &s;hould attempt to do him <HI>(Taverner)</HI> any Injury.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Here I am to Note, that this Story made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the Country, and the Parti|culars appear'd to be &s;o faithfully related by <HI>Ta|verner,</HI> that abundance of Per&s;ons of Note came to him to have the Relation from his own Mouth; and among the re&s;t the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Down</HI> and <HI>Connor,</HI> who I name in Reverence, not to his Dignity only, or &s;o much, as in Reve|rence of his known Piety and Seriou&s;ne&s;s in Reli|gion: Being the fam'd Doctor <HI>Jeremy Taylor,</HI> Author of a known Book call'd <HI>Rules of Holy Living and Dying.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="291">
THIS Reverend Father &s;ent for the &s;aid <HI>Francis Taverner,</HI> to examine him about <HI>this &s;trange &s;cene of Providence,</HI> &s;o the Bi&s;hop call'd it; and he did examine him &s;trictly about it, and the Account &s;ays, his Lord&s;hip was fully &s;atisfied, that the Appa|rition was true and real; that is to &s;ay, that it was true that there was really &s;uch an Apparition.</P>
<P>NOW all this is within the Bounds of what I have laid down, <HI>viz.</HI> That there are really Appa|ritions, and the&s;e Apparitions do per&s;onate &s;uch and &s;uch Bodies or Shapes, who&s;e Names they take upon them, and who&s;e Per&s;ons they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>BUT for the re&s;t, I think all the Notions that the People then entertain'd of it, and even the Bi|&s;hop among the re&s;t, mu&s;t be very erroneous and mi&s;taken. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Bi&s;hop entertain'd the Story, as if this Apparition was really the Soul of the departed <HI>James Haddock,</HI> as appear'd by a &s;econd Examination of <HI>Taverner</HI> by his Lord&s;hip; for the Lady <HI>Con|way,</HI> and other Per&s;ons of Quality, hearing the Bi&s;hop had &s;ent for <HI>Taverner</HI> to examine him, went all away to be pre&s;ent at the Examination: And the Bi&s;hop being gone to a Town call'd <HI>Hillsbro'</HI> three Miles off, the Company went all thither, and <HI>Ta|verner</HI> was &s;ent for to them, and there examin'd of all the Particulars again, and an&s;wer'd again to the Satisfaction of all the Company.</P>
<P>BUT here (and for this rea&s;on I relate this part) his Lord&s;hip, after asking many more Que&s;tions, concluded by advi&s;ing <HI>Taverner</HI> to ask the Appari|tion when it came again, Whence are you, are you a good or an evil Spirit? by which is &s;uppos'd his Lord&s;hip under&s;tood, Are you in a good or bad State; for his next Que&s;tion was, Where is your Abode? what Station do you hold? how are you regimented in the other World? and what is the Rea&s;on that you appear for the Relief of your Son
<PB N="278" REF="292">
in &s;o &s;mall a Matter, when &s;o many Widows and Orphans are oppre&s;s'd in the World, being de|frauded of greater Matters, and none from thence of their Relations appear to right them?</P>
<P>AND the very &s;ame Night <HI>Taverner</HI> meeting the Apparition again, who, it &s;eems, was fully &s;a|tisfy'd with what he had done in delivering the Me&s;&s;age to the Executor; at this Appearing <HI>Ta|verner</HI> ask'd him the Que&s;tions above, but it gave him no An&s;wer; and indeed it could not be ex|pected that Curio&s;ity &s;hould be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>FOR, as I &s;aid above, it is evident by the Que&s;tions, the Bi&s;hop, in all the&s;e Examinations, fell in with the vulgar Error of the Time about &s;uch Apparitions, namely, that it was the Soul of <HI>James Haddock;</HI> and well indeed might he ask how he came to Appear, when others in Ca&s;es of greater Moment did not.</P>
<P>BUT he &s;hould have ask'd, How is it po&s;&s;ible you that are dead &s;hould be acquainted with the&s;e Circum&s;tances, when the Word of God &s;ays ex|pre&s;ly the Dead know not any thing, and that all their Love and Hatred is peri&s;hed? Had he ask'd him, that, perhaps he might have told him that he was not the Soul of <HI>James Haddock,</HI> but a good Spirit &s;ent from the invi&s;ible World by the e&s;pecial directi|on of Heaven, to right a poor, ruin'd, oppre&s;s'd Orphan, abandon'd to Injury by its own unnatural Mother. But to talk of the Soul of <HI>James Had|dock,</HI> and what Station it held in the other World, the Apparition might well go away, and give no An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>NOR in any of this Di&s;cour&s;e did the Appari|tion pretend it was not at Re&s;t, or could not be at Re&s;t 'till Ju&s;tice was done to the Child, or 'till the Me&s;&s;age was deliver'd: the Apparition was too ju&s;t to it&s;elf to &s;ay &s;o: and on the other Hand, 'tis to me one of the mo&s;t convincing Proofs, that
<PB N="279" REF="293">
it was really an Apparition or Appearance of a Spirit.</P>
<P>NOW, as in other Ca&s;es, what Spirit it was may be worth taking Notice of; here is not the lea&s;t room to &s;ugge&s;t that it was the <HI>Devil,</HI> or an evil Spirit; and therefore the Bi&s;hop was wrong in that too, to ask if it was a good or evil Spirit; for how &s;hould his Wi&s;dom judge, who was him&s;elf a good Man, that an evil Spirit &s;hould come of a good Errand, to right an injur'd Orphan, an op|pre&s;s'd Fatherle&s;s Child? the <HI>Devil,</HI> or any evil Spirit, could hardly be &s;uppos'd to move about &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erv'd here, and &s;hould have been added to the Story, that the &s;aid <HI>Davis</HI> and his Wife, tho' it &s;eems much again&s;t his Will, did give up the Lea&s;e to the Child, the Son of that <HI>James Haddock;</HI> with this di&s;mal Circum&s;tance, at|tending it, <HI>viz.</HI> That about five Years after, and when the Bi&s;hop was dead, one <HI>Co&s;tlet,</HI> who was the Child's Tru&s;tee, threatned to take away the Lea&s;e again, rail'd at <HI>Taverner,</HI> and made terrible Imprecations upon him&s;elf if he knew of the Lea&s;e, and threatned to go to Law with the Orphan. But one Night being drunk at the Town of <HI>Hill|Hall,</HI> near <HI>Lisburne</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where all this Scene was laid, going home he fell from his Hor&s;e and never &s;poke more, and &s;o the Child enjoy'd the E&s;tate peaceably ever after.</P>
<P>IN a Word, the little injur'd Orphan &s;eem'd to be the Care of Heaven in a particular manner; and the good Angel which appear'd in its behalf without doubt executed God's Ju&s;tice upon the wicked drunken Oppre&s;&s;or, the Tru&s;tee; and as he imprecated Vengeance on him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;ame Spirit might be Commi&s;&s;ion'd to &s;ee it fall upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="294">
AND here it mo&s;t naturally occurs to ob&s;erve that the departed Souls of Men and Women dead and buried, cannot be &s;uppos'd to have any Com|mi&s;&s;ion to execute particular Vengeance on any in this World; the Suppo&s;ition of this would bring a confus'd medly of Notions upon us, &s;uch as would be incon&s;i&s;tent not with Religion only, but even with common Sen&s;e; and which need not take up any of our Pains to confute them.</P>
<P>NOTHING has more fill'd the idle Heads of the old Women of the&s;e latter Ages than the Stories of Gho&s;ts and Apparitions coming to Peo|ple, to tell them where Money was hidden, and how to find it; and 'tis wonderful to me that &s;uch Tales &s;hould make &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions, and that &s;ometimes among wi&s;e and judicious People too, as we find they have done. How many old Hou|&s;es have been almo&s;t pull'd down, and Pitts fruit|le&s;ly dug in the Earth, at the ridiculous Motion of pretended Apparitions? of which I &s;hall &s;peak more in its Place.</P>
<P>I HAVE hitherto &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided giving you any Accounts, however extraordinary, that have been already made publick; but this one, which relates to the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the great Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> (whether famous or infamous I know not which to determine him) in the time of the late King <HI>Charles</HI> I, I cannot omit, becau&s;e the va|rious manner of its being related &s;o eminently touches the Ca&s;e in Hand.</P>
<P>THAT the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was &s;labb'd by one Lieutenant <HI>Felton</HI> at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> as he was go|ing upon an Expedition for the Relief of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> Hi&s;tory is &s;o full of it, and all that know any thing of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Annals are &s;o well acquainted with the Story of it, that I need &s;ay nothing to introduce that Part: Mr. <HI>Aubrey</HI> takes upon him to relate the Story of an Apparition upon this Oc|ca&s;ion in the following manner:</P>
<Q><PB N="281" REF="295">
To one Mr. <HI>Towes</HI> who had been School-fel|low with Sir <HI>George Villers,</HI> the Father of the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and was his Friend and Neighbour, as he lay in his Bed awake (and it was Day-light) came into his Chamber the Phantome of his dear Friend Sir <HI>George Villers.</HI> Said Mr. <HI>Towes</HI> to him, Why, you are dead! what makes you here? Said the Knight, I am dead, but cannot re&s;t in Peace for the Wicked|ne&s;s and Abomination of my Son <HI>George</HI> at Court. I do appear to you to tell him of it, and to ad|vi&s;e and dehort him from his evil ways. Said Mr. <HI>Towes,</HI> The Duke will not believe me, but will &s;ay that I am mad, or doat. Said Sir <HI>George</HI> Go to him from me, and tell him by &s;uch a Token (a Mole) that he had in &s;ome &s;ecret Place, which none but him&s;elf knew of. Accord|ingly Mr. <HI>Towes</HI> went to the Duke, who <HI>laugh'd at his Me&s;&s;age.</HI> At his return home, the Phantome appeared again, and told that the Duke would be &s;tabb'd (he drew out a Dagger) a quarter of a Year after; which accordingly happened.</Q>
<P>THIS Part of the Story indeed is calculated like a true Chimney-corner Piece of News; that Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was dead, &s;hould &s;ay he could not re&s;t in Peace for the Wickedne&s;s and Abomination of his Son <HI>George</HI> at Court.</P>
<P>PREPOSTEROUS! What State mu&s;t old Sir <HI>George</HI> be in? If in a State of Mi&s;ery, what does he mean by <HI>re&s;ting in Peace?</HI> if in a State of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, what could his Son do to impeach his Re&s;t? and if we &s;hall give any weight to what the Scripture &s;ays in that Ca&s;e, he knew nothing of him, let his own State or his Son's <HI>Abominations</HI> (as he calls them) be what they would. See <HI>Job</HI> xiv. 19, 20, 21. <HI>The waters wear the Stones: thou wa&s;he&s;t away the things which grow out of the du&s;t of the earth, and thou de|&s;troye&s;t the hope of man. Thou pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vaile&s;t for ever again&s;t</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="296">
<HI>him, and he pa&s;&s;eth: thou change&s;t his countenance, and &s;onde&s;t him away. His &s;ons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he per|ceiveth it not of them.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS plain here that the Hope (that is the Knowledge and Wi&s;dom) of Man as to this World, is de&s;troyed and wa&s;h'd away in Death; his Sons may ri&s;e or fall, be great or little, high or low, good or evil, 'tis all one to him, he knows nothing of it. How then could Sir <HI>George Villers</HI> &s;ay, &s;everal Years after he was dead too, that he could not re&s;t in Peace? What! had he been at Re&s;t and in Peace, and was he di&s;quieted again by his Son <HI>George</HI>'s Wickedne&s;s? that does not hang together at all. The old Knight had been dead &s;everal Years before his Son <HI>George</HI> came to ri&s;e at Court; when he did ri&s;e, he was not immediately &s;o abominably wicked as he was afterward: Where then was the Soul of Sir <HI>George</HI> the Father, all the while? his Re&s;t could not be di&s;turb'd 'till the Circum&s;tances that di&s;turb'd it happen'd.</P>
<P>BUT my Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> tells this &s;ame Story, with much more Probability of Truth; for fir&s;t he leaves out the Ab&s;urdity, which indeed his Lord&s;hip was too wi&s;e a Man to impo&s;e upon the World with the Sanction of his Authority, nor was there Sen&s;e enough in it to give it Credit.</P>
<P>IN the next Place he does not make the Per&s;on to whom Sir <HI>George Villers</HI> appear'd, be an Equal, and an Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mate Friend, but one that had liv'd in the &s;ame Town where Sir <HI>George</HI> had liv'd, and had not &s;een him for many Years, but recollected him from the Cloaths he had &s;een him wear; whereas the Story above makes them dear Friends, which if it had been &s;o, it was not likely he &s;hould re|fu&s;e to hear the Me&s;&s;age, and yet he &s;cruples it very much.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="297">
BUT there are more di&s;cording Circum&s;tances in the Story. Let us take the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Re|lation, which is done with an appparent Regard to Truth, and is as follows:</P>

<P>BESIDES the above-named cla&s;hing Circum|&s;tances in the differing Relation of this Story, there are one or two that are very material, as will ap|pear by the following Remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AUBREY</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Towes,</HI> as he calls him, went to the Duke, and told him the Token; not|with&s;tanding which, the Duke laugh'd at his Me&s;|&s;age: whereas my Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> tells ju&s;t the con|trary, that the Duke gave him an open, tho' a very particular Audience; all his Attendance keeping at a di&s;tance, and that he held him in that earne&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e for an Hour.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>AUBREY</HI> &s;ays, the Token Sir <HI>George</HI> gave to enforce or engage his Son's Attention, was, that he (the Duke) had a Mole in &s;uch a private Part of his Body; but my Lord &s;ays, the Token given was of &s;uch a Nature as the Duke &s;wore none but the <HI>Devil</HI> and one Per&s;on in the World could know, and that he was &s;ure that one Per&s;on would not &s;peak of it; and that the Duke was extremely di&s;turbed when he heard of it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> FAME, tho' with &s;ome Privacy, &s;ays, that the &s;ecret Token was an ince&s;tuous Breach of Mode&s;ty between the Duke and a certain Lady too nearly related to him, which it &s;ur|prized the Duke to hear of; and that as he thought he had good Rea&s;on to be &s;ure the Lady would not tell it of her &s;elf, &s;o he thought none but the Devil could tell it be&s;ides her; and this a&s;toni&s;hed him, &s;o that he was very far from receiving the Man &s;lightly, or laughing at his Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>WHAT this Apparition then was, and from whom, or from whence, remains to be decided. That the thing was real, is too well atte&s;ted; it comes
<PB N="289" REF="303">
loaded with &s;o many concurring Circum&s;tances, and told in the hearing of &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es of good Fame and Credit, that there is no Room to que&s;tion the Fact; and as to the various Ways of relating it, the Truth of the whole is not a|bated by it at all: only as is natural to things of this Nature which pa&s;s thro' &s;o many Hands, eve|ry one expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves their own way, tho' meaning the &s;ame thing; they often vary at la&s;t in the very Sub&s;tance, by only varying at fir&s;t in the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE Truth of the Matter is at la&s;t, that the Apparition foretold his Ruin, and it &s;oon follow'd. Now that this Apparition could not be the <HI>Devil,</HI> is evident from the Rea&s;ons laid down before in the like Ca&s;es. How can we &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> would be offended with the wicked Life and abo|minable Practices of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> at Court? His ince&s;tuous Lewdne&s;s, and whatever o|ther &s;candalous Practices he allowed him&s;elf in, the <HI>Devil</HI> might, perhaps, encourage and prompt him to, but he would never &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd a Me&s;&s;enger to him to warn him again&s;t them, and to alarm him with Apprehen&s;ions of Danger attending him if he did not reform. This is none of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s, 'tis quite foreign to him, 'twould be the weake&s;t thing in the World to &s;ugge&s;t it of him.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if it were any thing immediately from Hea|ven, it would have been effectual to have awaken'd and reform'd him: But as it might be a kind Me&s;&s;en|ger from another part of the invi&s;ible World, where his approaching Fate was known, and who having given him this Notice, left his Reformation in his own Power, and laid the Nece&s;&s;ity of it before the Eyes of his Rea&s;on, as well as of his Con&s;cience, and that after this his Fall was of him&s;elf; this makes it all rational, and ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood, and is agreeable to the ordinary Cu&s;tom of Providence
<PB N="290" REF="304">
in like Ca&s;es, of which many Examples might be given in the World.</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;trange, that the Apparition &s;hould per&s;onate the old decea&s;ed Father of the Duke, and a&s;&s;ume his Shape, to add as it were a Solemnity to the Me&s;&s;age, and give it a greater Influence upon the Mind of the Duke; and the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger might have a&s;&s;umed any other Shape or Per&s;on if it had thought fit, whether living or dead.</P>
<P>BUT if the Shape a&s;&s;umed was the mo&s;t likely to give Weight to the Errand it was to be &s;ent a|bout, we are not to wonder at all that a Spirit em|ploy'd, or employing it &s;elf on an Errand of &s;uch Importance, &s;hould be able to &s;ingle out &s;uch Ap|pearances, or &s;uch Shapes and Per&s;ons to appear in the Figure of, as were apte&s;t to enforce the Me&s;|&s;age. The well-chu&s;ing the Per&s;on is to me a Te&s;ti|mony for, not again&s;t the Goodne&s;s, the Judgment and Capacity of the per&s;onating Spirit, and would with ju&s;t rea&s;oning confirm to us the validity of the Me&s;&s;age, and of the Me&s;&s;enger al&s;o.</P>
<P>AND yet 'tis very rea&s;onable to believe, that Sir <HI>George Villers,</HI> thus &s;eeming to appear, and who&s;e Surface or Out-&s;ide is put on like a Ma&s;querade Habit upon this Occa&s;ion, knew nothing of it, and had no manner of concern in it. Nothing is more won|derful in any part of the Story to me, than that Men of Sen&s;e and Learning, as &s;ome &s;uch have been, could be prevailed upon, or rather could prevail upon them&s;elves, to publi&s;h to the World &s;uch in|congruous, &s;uch irrational things as the&s;e; that a Man dead, perhaps twenty Years before, I think it's &s;o much at lea&s;t; &s;hould appear, and &s;ay, he could not re&s;t in Peace for &s;uch and &s;uch things. And in ano|ther of the &s;ame Author's Stories, an Apparition is brought in appearing to Dr. <HI>Turberville</HI>'s Si&s;ter, be|ing a Lady who was dead, and had left &s;ome Chil|dren to her Husband, which Children were injur'd
<PB N="291" REF="305">
by a &s;econd Wife, contrary to the Settlement of the fir&s;t Wife's Marriage; and this Settlement of the fir&s;t Marriage was it &s;eems hid behind the Wain|&s;cot, in &s;uch and &s;uch a Place, which no body knew of but the Children's Mother, that is to &s;ay the fir&s;t Wife. This Lady appeared to di&s;cover where this Writing lay, and tells the Per&s;on to whom &s;he di&s;cover'd it, that 'till &s;he had made this Di&s;covery, &s;he had wander'd in the Air, but that now &s;he was going to God.</P>
<P>STRANGE! that Mr. <HI>Glanvil, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">brey,</HI> and o|thers, could publi&s;h &s;uch a Story as this, without &s;ome ju&s;t Enquiries to reconcile it to common Sen&s;e, as well as to Religion; as particularly how long this Lady had been Dead; for it &s;eems to have been &s;ome Years, the Husband being married again, and the Children being in danger of being wrong'd by the Children of the &s;econd Venter? Now, did the Soul of the fir&s;t Lady wander all that while in the Air, to &s;ee whether there &s;hould be any oc|ca&s;ion for her, to vindicate her Children's Right, or no? did &s;he &s;tay from going to God all that while, only for di&s;covering a conceal'd Deed, that her Children might not be wrong'd? how &s;hall we make &s;uch a thing out to be rational? what No|tions of Religion or of a future State will &s;up|port it?</P>
<P>WHY did &s;he not immediately di&s;cover where the Deed, or Marriage Settlement lay, and put it into the Hands of &s;ome hone&s;t People, in Tru&s;t for her Children? and then &s;he had not need to have wander'd in the Air 'till it had been done.</P>
<P>THEY mu&s;t have very low-priz'd Thoughts of Heaven, and of going to God, after the departing or &s;eparating of the Soul from the Body in Life, who think the Pa&s;&s;age can be interrupted by any of the Affairs of this Life left unfini&s;h'd. If even our Repentance unfini&s;h'd, our Peace with God unfini&s;h'd,
<PB N="292" REF="306">
can never be retreiv'd, if Time is not to be recalled; but that <HI>as the Tree falls, &s;o it &s;hall lie:</HI> Shall we pretend the Soul &s;hall be &s;topped and in|terrupted in its Pa&s;&s;age, to retrieve the Inju&s;tice and Violence done to the Orphans, or Relicts of the Family? &s;hall the Soul be brought back to find out old hidden Parchments, or as it is pretended in other like Stories, to dig up old long-buried Money, and the like?</P>
<P>NO, no; tho&s;e things &s;hould be done in time: like Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntance, they &s;hould not be left to that Hazard; for we may depend, there is no Work, or Device, or Invention in the Grave, whither we are all going.</P>
<P>THAT there are invi&s;ibe Agents, which in Pur|&s;uance of the Government of Providence in the World, may be made In&s;truments, to act in &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e; to di&s;cover Writings which being conceal'd may ruin Families, rob and plunder Or|phans, and di&s;tre&s;s the right Heirs of E&s;tates, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> many like Ca&s;es, this need not be deny'd, and is in|de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d not to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;puted; and 'tis a glorious Te&s;ti|mony to the Ju&s;tice of Providence, that in &s;uch Ca&s;es he does not abandon the Widows and the Orphans, who for want of lo&s;t or conceal'd Deeds, are &s;ometimes in Danger of being undone, by Vio|lence and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pine. But all this is ea&s;ier to be un|der&s;tood to be done without Interruption of the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things, without ob&s;tructing the Soul's Pa&s;&s;age into its determined &s;tate of Happi|ne&s;s or Mi&s;ery; which it mu&s;t be the weake&s;t, and indeed the wickede&s;t thing in the World, to think can be diverted by the&s;e Trifles; and who&s;e di|rect Progre&s;&s;ion is plainly &s;tated in the Scripture in the&s;e Words: <HI>It is appointed unto all Men once to die, and after Death to Judgment;</HI> or immediately after Death to Judgment, at lea&s;t &s;o as nothing to prevent or intervene; <HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 27. <HI>It is appointed,</HI> and &s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly

the&s;e things can never break in upon that &s;olemn Appointment:</P>
<P>BESIDES, 'tis an evident Impeachment of the Power and Ju&s;tice, as well as the Wi&s;dom of Pro|vidence, in his Di&s;po&s;ition of things, as if he could not find out Ways to do right to injur'd Orphans, or to detect the Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion of violent and unrea&s;onable Men, but the Soul of the depart|ed Mother mu&s;t be kept out of Heaven to do it her &s;elf. Horrid Ab&s;urdity! and incon&s;i&s;tent with all the Notions that true Religion has in&s;pir'd us with, relating to a Future State, and to the Gulph that is fix'd betwen this and that.</P>
<P>THE Soul can no more be kept out from, or delay'd its Entrance into Heaven, if its Portion be appointed for Happine&s;s, by any Concern for the Affairs of this World, than it can b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d af|ter it is entered tho&s;e Realms of Peace, and di&s;turbed or brought back from thence upon any Account what&s;oever.</P>

I take this Ab&s;urdity in|deed to be much of the Cau&s;e of that ju&s;t Ridicule, which the wi&s;er Part of Mankind have put upon mo&s;t of the Stories which are told among us about Witchcraft and Apparitions; for that they are told with &s;uch evident Incon&s;i&s;tences, that they cannot go down with rational People: Who can believe what cannot be true? who can make a &s;eri|ous thing of a piece of ridiculous Non&s;en&s;e?

<P>BUT I am &s;ick of the very Repetition; the De|lu&s;ion is &s;o gro&s;s, I &s;ay it is not to be wondered that we are &s;hock'd by it in our belief of the thing call'd Apparition in general. The ridiculous Part di&s;credits the real Part, and it being &s;o &s;ufeiting to our Rea&s;on to hear the fir&s;t Part, we throw off our Patience, and will hear nothing at all of it.</P>
<P>IT is true we &s;hould not do thus; the Reality of the Thing, ab&s;tracted from the&s;e di&s;tracted and en|thu&s;ia&s;tick Notions, is not le&s;&s;en'd: 'tis our Bu&s;ine&s;s then to reject the fooli&s;h Part, which indeed has almo&s;t &s;mother'd and buried the re&s;t in its Du&s;t and Rubbi&s;h, and let us judge rightly of things as they are. There is no want of Examples, where (Provi|dence permitting) Apparition has made Di&s;cove|ries of villainous and di&s;hone&s;t Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ions and De&s;igns; detected Violence and Murther, done Right to in|jur'd and oppre&s;s'd Widows, and Fatherle&s;s Chil|dren; and this without &s;uch a mon&s;trous and incon|&s;i&s;tent Addition, as that of bringing back the Soul from its Entrance into Heaven, or di&s;turbing its Re&s;t and Peace in a future State: things too gro&s;s to be &s;o much as nam'd among Chri&s;tians, who&s;e Faith in things Future is too well e&s;tabli&s;h'd to be capable of receiving any Impre&s;&s;ions from &s;uch Delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>I HAVE an Example in Story very particular to this Ca&s;e; and which my Author a&s;&s;ures me of the Truth of, tho' never yet publi&s;h'd in Print: The Story is told of the late Reverend Dr. <HI>Scot,</HI> a
<PB REF="311">

<PB N="295" REF="312">
Man who&s;e Learning and Piety was eminent, and who&s;e Judgment was known to be &s;o good, as not to be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>THE Doctor, as I have the Story related, was &s;itting alone by the Fire, either in his Study or his Parlour, in <HI>Broad&s;treet</HI> where he liv'd, and reading a Book, his Door being &s;hut fa&s;t and lock'd; he was well a&s;&s;ur'd there was no body in the Room but him&s;elf, when accidentally rai&s;ing his Head a little, he was exceedingly &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee &s;itting in an Elbow Chair, at the other &s;ide of the Fire-place or Chimney, an Antient grave Gentleman in a black Velvet Gown, a long Whig, and looking with a plea&s;ing Countenance towards him <HI>(the Doctor)</HI> as if ju&s;t going to &s;peak.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Another Per&s;on relating this Story, &s;ays the Antient Gentleman appear'd &s;tanding, and having ju&s;t opened the Door of the Doctor's Study, he was come in; and &s;aluting the Doctor &s;poke fir&s;t to him: but the Difference is but &s;mall.</P>
<P>THE Relations agree in this part, that the Doctor was greatly &s;urpriz'd at the &s;ight of him; and indeed the &s;eeing him as &s;itting in a Chair was the mo&s;t likely to be &s;urprizing; becau&s;e the Doctor knowing the Door to be lock'd, and then &s;eeing a Man &s;itting in the Chair, he mu&s;t immediately and at fir&s;t &s;ight conclude him to be a Spirit, or Appa|rition, or <HI>Devil,</HI> call it as you will; whereas &s;ee|ing him come in at the Door, he might at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;uppo&s;e him to be really a Gentleman come to &s;peak with him, and might think he had omitted fa&s;tning the Door, as he intended to have done.</P>
<P>BUT be it which of the two it will, the Do|ctor appear'd in great di&s;order at the &s;ight, as he ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nowledg'd to tho&s;e to whom he told the Story, and from whom I receiv'd this Account, with very little remove of Hands between.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="313">
THE Spectre it &s;eems began, for the Doctor had not Courage at fir&s;t, as he &s;aid, to &s;peak to it; I &s;ay the Spectre or Apparition &s;poke fir&s;t, and de&s;ir'd the Doctor not to be frighted, not to be &s;urpriz'd, for that he would not do him any hurt; but that he came to him upon a Matter of great Importance to an injur'd Family, which was in great danger of being Ruin'd; and that tho' he (the Doctor) was a Stranger to the Family, yet know|ing him to be a Man of Integrity, he had pitch'd upon him to do an act of very great Charity, as well as Ju&s;tice; and that he could depend upon him for a punctual Performance.</P>
<P>THE Doctor was not at fir&s;t compos'd enough to receive the Introduction of the Bu&s;ine&s;s with a due attention; but &s;eem'd rather inclin'd to get out of the Room if he could, and once or twice made &s;ome Attempt to knock for &s;ome of the Fa|mily to come up, at which the Apparition appear'd a little di&s;pleas'd.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems he need not; for, as the Doctor &s;aid, he had no power to go out of the Room if he had been next the Door, or to knock for Help if any had been at hand.</P>
<P>BUT here the Apparition &s;eeing the Doctor &s;till in Confu&s;ion, de&s;ir'd him again to compo&s;e him&s;elf, for he would not do him the lea&s;t Injury, or offer any thing to make him unea&s;ie; but de&s;ir'd that he would give him leave to deliver the Bu&s;ine&s;s he came about, which when he had heard, perhaps he would &s;ee le&s;s cau&s;e to be &s;urpriz'd or apprehen&s;ive than he did now.</P>
<P>BY this time, and by the calm way of Di&s;cour&s;e above mention'd, the Doctor recover'd him&s;elf &s;o much, tho' not with any kind of Compo&s;ure, as to &s;peak.</P>
<P>IN the Name of God, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> what art thou?</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="314">
I DESIRE you would not be frighted, <HI>&s;ays the Apparition</HI> to him again; I am a Stranger to you, and if I tell you my Name, you do not know it; but you may do the Bu&s;ine&s;s without enquiring.</P>

<P>UPON this the Spectre &s;eem'd di&s;pleas'd, as if the Doctor had not treated him with Re&s;pect; and expo&s;tulated a little with him, telling him he could have terrify'd him into a Compliance, but that he cho&s;e to come calmly and quietly to him; and u&s;ed &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;o civil and obliging, that by this time he began to be a little more Familiar, and at length the Doctor ask'd,</P>
<P>WHAT is it you would have with me?</P>
<P>AT this the Apparition, as if gratify'd with the Que&s;tion, began his Story thus.</P>
<P>I LIV'D in the County of&mdash;</P>
<P>I do not exactly remember the County he named; but it was in &s;ome of the We&s;tern Counties of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Here he gave him his own Name, the Name of his younger Brother, and the Names of his two Nephews; but I am not allow'd to publi&s;h the Names in this Relation, nor might it be proper for many Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>HERE the Doctor interrupted, and ask'd him how long the Grand&s;on had been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the E&s;tate; which he told him was&mdash;Years, intimating that he had been &s;o long dead.</P>

<P>STILL the Doctor could not &s;ee into the Mat|ter, or what he could do to help or remedy the Evil that threaten'd the Family; and therefore ask'd him &s;ome Que&s;tions: for now they began to be a little better acquainted than at fir&s;t.</P>

<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> and &s;till what can I do in the Ca&s;e?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the Spectre,</HI> if you will go down to my Grand&s;on's Hou&s;e, and take &s;uch Per&s;ons with you as you can tru&s;t, I will give you &s;uch In|&s;tructions as that you &s;hall find out the Deed or Settlement, which lies concealed in a Place where I put it with my own Hands, and where you &s;hall direct my Grand&s;on to take it out in your Pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>BUT why then can you not direct your Grand|&s;on him&s;elf to do this? <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>ASK me not about that, <HI>&s;ays the Apparition;</HI> there are divers Rea&s;ons which you may know hereafter. I can depend upon your Hone&s;ty in it, in the mean time; and I will &s;o di&s;po&s;e Mat|ters that you &s;hall have your Expences paid you, and be hand&s;omely allow'd for your Trouble.</P>
<P>AFTER this Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;everal other Ex|po&s;tulations, (for the Doctor was not ea&s;ily prevail'd upon to go 'till the Spect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;eem'd to look angrily,
<PB N="299" REF="316">
and even to threaten him for refu&s;ing,) he did at la&s;t Promi&s;e him to go.</P>
<P>HAVING obtain'd a Promi&s;e of him, he told him he might let his Grand&s;on know that he had formerly convers'd with his Grandfather, (but not how lately, or in what Manner,) and ask to &s;ee the Hou&s;e; and that in &s;uch an upper Room or Loft, he &s;hould find a great deal of old Lumber, old Coffers, old Che&s;ts, and &s;uch Things as were out of Fa&s;hion now, thrown by, and pil'd up upon one another, to make room for more modi&s;h Fur|niture, Cabinets, Che&s;ts of Drawers, and the like.</P>
<P>THAT in &s;uch a particular Corner was &s;uch a certain old Che&s;t, with an old broken Lock upon it, and a Key in it, which could neither be turn'd in the Lock, or pull'd out of it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Here he gave him a particular De&s;cription of the Che&s;t, and of the Out&s;ide, the Lock and the Cover, and al&s;o of the In&s;ide, and of a pri|vate place in it, which no Man could come to, or find out, unle&s;s the whole Che&s;t was pull'd in Pieces.</P>
<P>IN that Che&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and in that place, lyes the grand Deed, or Charter of the E&s;tate, which conveys the Inheritance, and without which the Family will be ruin'd, and turn'd out of Doors.</P>
<P>AFTER this Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Doctor pro|mi&s;ing to go down into the Country and di&s;patch this important Commi&s;&s;ion; the Apparition putting on a very plea&s;ant and &s;miling A&s;pect, thank'd him, and di&s;appear'd.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome Days, and within the time limit|ed by the Propo&s;al of the Spectre, the Doctor went down accordingly into&mdash;<HI>&s;hire;</HI> and find|ing the Gentleman's Hou&s;e very readily, by the Direction, knock'd at the Door, and ask'd if he was at home; and after being told he was, and the Servants telling their Ma&s;ter it was a Clergyman, the
<PB N="300" REF="317">
Gentleman came to the Door, and very court<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;ly invited him in.</P>
<P>AFTER the Doctor had been there &s;ome time, he ob&s;erv'd the Gentleman receiv'd him with an unexpected Civility, tho' a Stranger, and without Bu&s;ine&s;s: They enter'd into many friendly Di&s;cour|&s;es, and the Doctor pretended to have heard much of the Family, (as, indeed, he had) and of hi Grandfather; from whom, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I perceive the E&s;tate more immediately de&s;cends to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>AY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> and &s;hook his Head, my Father died young, and my Grandfather has left Things &s;o confus'd, that for want of one princi|pal Writing, which is not yet come to Hand, I have met with a great deal of trouble from a couple of Cou&s;ins, my Grandfather's Brother's Children, who have put me to a great deal of Charge about it. And with that the Doctor &s;eem|ing a little inqui&s;itive.</P>
<P>BUT I hope you have got over it, Sir? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>NO truly, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> to be &s;o open with you, we &s;hall never get quite over it unle&s;s we can find this old Deed; which, however, I hope we &s;hall find, for I intend to make a general Search for it.</P>
<P>I WISH with all my Heart you may find it, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>I DON'T doubt but I &s;hall; I had a &s;trange Dream about it but la&s;t Night, <HI>&s;ays the Gentle|man.</HI></P>
<P>A DREAM about the Writing! <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I hope it was that you &s;hould find it then?</P>
<P>I DREAM'D, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> that a &s;trange Gentleman came to me, that I had never &s;een in my Life, and help'd me to look it. I don't know but you may be the Man.</P>
<P>I SHOULD be very glad to be the Man, I am &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="318">
NAY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> you may be the Man to help me look it.</P>
<P>AY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I may help you look it indeed, and I'll do that too with all my Heart; but I wou'd much rather be the Man that &s;hould help you find it: Pray when do you intend to make a &s;earch?</P>
<P>TO-MORROW, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I had ap|pointed to do it.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> in what manner do you intend to &s;earch?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> 'tis all our Opinion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> that my Grandfather was &s;o very much concern'd to pre&s;erve this Writing, and had &s;o much Jealou|&s;y that &s;ome that were about him would take it from him if they could, that he has hid it in &s;ome &s;ecret Place; and I'm re&s;olv'd I'll pull half the Hou&s;e down but I'll find it, if it be above Ground.</P>
<P>TRULY, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> he may have hid it &s;o, that you mu&s;t pull the Hou&s;e down before you find it, and perhaps not then either. I have known &s;uch things utterly lo&s;t, by the very Care taken to pre&s;erve them.</P>
<P>IF it was made of &s;omething the Fire wou'd not de&s;troy, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I'd burn the Hou&s;e down but I'd find it.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE you have &s;earch'd all the old Gen|tleman's Che&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and Trunks, and Coffers over and over? <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>AY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> and turn'd them all in|&s;ide outward, and there they lie of a heap up in a great Loft, or Garret, with nothing in them; nay, we knock'd three or four of them in Pieces to &s;earch for private Drawers, and then I burnt them for Anger, tho' they were fine old Cypre&s;s Che&s;ts, that co&s;t Money enough when they were in Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I'M &s;orry you burnt them, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="319">
NAY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I did not burn a &s;crap of them 'till they were all &s;plit to Pieces; and it was not po&s;&s;ible there cou'd be any thing there.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> This made the Doctor a little ea&s;y; for he began to be &s;urpriz'd when he told him he had &s;plit &s;ome of them out, and burnt them.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> if I can do you any Service in your Search, I'll come and &s;ee you again to-morrow, and wait upon your Search with my good Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I don't de&s;ign to part with you; &s;ince you are &s;o kind to offer me your Help, you &s;hall &s;tay all Night then, and be at the fir&s;t of it.</P>
<P>THE Doctor had now gain'd his Point &s;o far as to make him&s;elf acquainted and de&s;irable in the Hou&s;e, and to have a kind of Intimacy; &s;o that tho' he made as if he would go, he did not want much En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">reaties to make him &s;tay; &s;o he con&s;ented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o lie in the Hou&s;e all Night.</P>
<P>A LITTLE before Evening the Gentleman ask'd him to take a Walk in his Park, but he put it off with a Je&s;t; I had rather, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he &s;miling,</HI> you'd let me &s;ee this fine old Man&s;ion Hou&s;e that is to be demoli&s;h'd to-morrow; methinks I'd fain &s;ee the Hou&s;e once, before you pull it down.</P>
<P>WITH all my Heart, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI> So he carry'd him immediately up Stairs, &s;hew'd him all the be&s;t Apartments, and all his fine Furniture and Pictures; and coming to the Head of the great Stair-Ca&s;e where they came up, offer'd to go down again.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> &s;hall we not go up higher?</P>
<P>THERE'S nothing there, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but Garrets and old Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ts full of Rubbi&s;h, and a Place to go out into the Turret, and the Clock-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="320">
O, LET me &s;ee it all, now we are a going, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI> I love to &s;ee the old lofty Towers and Turrets, the Magnificence of our Ance&s;tors, tho' they are out of Fa&s;hion now; Pray let us &s;ee all, now we are going.</P>
<P>WHY, it will tire you, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>NO, no, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> if it don't tire you that have &s;een it &s;o often, it won't tire me, I a&s;&s;ure you: Pray let us go up. So away the Gentleman goes, and the Doctor after him.</P>
<P>AFTER they had rambled over the wild Part of an old-built great Hou&s;e, which I need not de|&s;cribe, he pa&s;&s;es by a great Room, the Door of which was open, and in it a great deal of old Lum|ber: And what Place is this, pray? <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> looking in at the Door, but not offering to go in.</P>
<P>O! THAT'S the Room, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman &s;oftly, becau&s;e there was a Servant attending them,</HI> that's the Room I told you of, where all the old Rubbi&s;h lay, the Che&s;ts, the Coffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and the Trunks; look there, &s;ee how they are pil'd up upon one ano|ther almo&s;t to the Ceiling.</P>
<P>WITH this the Doctor goes in and looks about him; for this was the Place he was directed to, and which he wanted to &s;ee: He was not in the Room two Minutes but he found every thing ju&s;t as the Spectre at <HI>London</HI> had de&s;crib'd, went di|rectly to the Pile he had been told of, and fixes his Eye upon the very Che&s;t with the old ru&s;ty Lock upon it, with the Key in it, which would neither turn round, nor come out.</P>
<P>ON my Word, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> you have taken Pains enough, if you have rumag'd all the&s;e Drawers, and Che&s;ts, and Coffers, and every thing that may have been in them.</P>
<P>INDEED, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I have emptied every one of them my&s;elf, and look'd over all the
<PB N="304" REF="321">
old mu&s;ty Writings one by one; with &s;ome help, indeed; but they, every one, pa&s;t thro' my own Hand, and under my Eye.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I &s;ee you have been in earne&s;t, and I find the thing is of great Con|&s;equence to you: I have a &s;trange Fancy come in|to my Head this very Moment; will you gratify my Curio&s;ity with but opening and emptying one &s;mall Che&s;t or Coffer that I have ca&s;t my Eye up|on? there may be nothing in it, for you are &s;atis|fy'd, I believe, that I was never here before; but I have a &s;trange Notion that there are &s;ome pri|vate Places in it which you have not found; per|haps there may be nothing in them, when they are found.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman looks at the Che&s;t &s;miling, I remember opening it very well; and turning to his Servant, <HI>Will, &s;ays he,</HI> don't you remember that Che&s;t? Yes, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> very well, I remember you were &s;o weary you &s;at down upon the Che&s;t when every thing was out of it, you clap'd down the Lid and &s;at down, and &s;ent me to my Lady to bring you a Dram of Citron; you &s;aid you were &s;o tir'd you was ready to faint.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, 'twas only a Fancy of mine, and very likely to have nothing in it.</P>
<P>'TIS no matter for that, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee it turn'd bottom up again before your Face, and &s;o you &s;hall all the re&s;t, if you do but &s;peak the Word.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> if you will oblige me but with that one, I'll trouble you no far|ther.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY the Gentleman cau&s;es the Coffer to be drag'd out, and open'd; for it would not be lock'd, the Key would neither lock it nor unlock it: when the Papers were all out, the Do|ctor turning his Face another way, as if he would
<PB N="305" REF="322">
look among the Papers, but taking little or no Notice of the Che&s;t, &s;toop'd down, and as if &s;up|porting him&s;elf with his Cane, chops his Cane in|to the Che&s;t, but &s;natcht it out again ha&s;tily, as if it had been a Mi&s;take, and turning to the Che&s;t he claps the Lid of it down, and &s;its down upon it, as if he was a weary too.</P>
<P>HOWEVER he takes an Opportunity to &s;peak to the Gentleman &s;oftly, to &s;end away his Man a Moment; for I wou'd &s;peak a Word or two with you, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> out of his hearing; and then re|collecting him&s;elf, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he aloud,</HI> can you not &s;end for a Hammer and a Chi&s;el?</P>
<P>YES, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI> Go, <HI>Will, &s;ays he to his Man,</HI> fetch a Hammer and Chi&s;el.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as <HI>Will</HI> was gone, Now, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> let me &s;ay a bold Word to you; I have found your Writing; I have found your Grand Deed of Set|tlement; I'll lay you a hundred Guineas I have it in this Coffer?</P>
<P>THE Gentleman takes up the Lid again, han|dles the Che&s;t, looks over every Part of it, but could &s;ee nothing; he is confounded and amaz'd! What d'ye mean? <HI>&s;ays he to the Doctor,</HI> you have no unu&s;ual Art I hope, no Conjuring in hand; here's nothing but an empty Coffer?</P>
<P>NOT I upon my Word, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I am no <HI>Magician,</HI> no <HI>Cunning-Man,</HI> I abhor it; but I tell you again the Writing is in this Coffer.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman knocks, and calls as if he was frighted, for his Man with the Hammer, but the Doctor &s;at compos'd again upon the Lid of the Coffer.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t up comes the Man with the Hammer and Chi&s;el, and the Doctor goes to work with the Che&s;t, knocks upon the flat of the Bottom; <HI>Hark!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>don't you hear it, Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>don't you hear it plainly?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="323">
HEAR what? <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI> I don't under|&s;tand you, indeed.</P>
<P>WHY the Che&s;t has a double Bottom, Sir, a fal&s;e Bottom, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor;</HI> don't you hear it &s;ound hollow?</P>
<P>IN a Word, they immediately &s;plit the inner Bottom open, and there lay the Parchment &s;pread abroad flat on the whole breadth of the Bottom of the Trunk, as a Quire of Paper is laid on the flat of a Drawer.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe the Joy and Surprize of the Gentleman, and &s;oon after of the whole Family; for the Gentleman &s;ent for his La|dy, and two of his Daughters, up into the Garret among all the Rubbi&s;h, to &s;ee not the Writing only, but the Place where it was found, and the Manner how.</P>
<P>YOU may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e the Doctor was care&s;s'd with uncommon Civilities in the Family, and &s;ent up (after about a Week's &s;tay) in the Gentleman's own Coach to <HI>London.</HI> I do not remember whe|ther he di&s;clos'd the Secret to the Gentleman, or no; I mean the Secret of the Apparition, by which the Place where the Writing was to be found, was di&s;cover'd to him, and who oblig'd him to come down on purpo&s;e to find it: I &s;ay, I do not remem|ber that Part, neither is it material. As far as I had the Story related, &s;o far I have handed it for|ward; and I have the truth of it affirmed in &s;uch a manner, as I cannot doubt it.</P>
<P>NOW to ob&s;erve a little upon this Pa&s;&s;age, which I am oblig'd to &s;ay is reported to me for Truth, and I firmly believe it to be &s;o: Certain it is, that finding this Writing was of the utmo&s;t Importance to the Family; and tho' I am not indeed inclin'd to publi&s;h Names to the Story, or to examine in|to the Particulars, by di&s;cour&s;ing with the Per&s;ons, for &s;ome may be yet Living, yet I &s;ay the E&s;tabli&s;hment
<PB N="307" REF="324">
of not a Family only, but a Generation of Families, might depend upon this Writing, and that no doubt made the antient Gentleman lay it up &s;o &s;afe. But why then might not Providence permit, nay even direct one of tho&s;e Intelligent Spi|rits or Angels, mention'd above, to give this Notice, and in this manner, where the main and only Deed or Charter for the Inheritance was to be found? as well as it has upon many like Occa&s;ions, or in Ca|&s;es alike in their Importance, made &s;trange and unaccountable Di&s;coveries of Things hid for many Ages; and this without Apparition, but by a ma|nife&s;t concurrence of Cau&s;es and Accidents next to Miracles.</P>
<P>I CANNOT think but that Providence, who&s;e Concern for the good and &s;afety of his Creatures is &s;o Univer&s;al, and who it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd is not unconcern'd even in the minute&s;t Circum|&s;tances, may think meet to bring &s;uch a thing as this to Light, upon which the good and welfare of a whole Family did &s;o much depend; and even to appear in an extraordinary Manner in it, without any Impeachment of its Wi&s;dom or its Power; and if the &s;ame Providence that thought fit to &s;ave this Family from &s;o much Inju&s;tice as at that time threaten'd it, thought fit to do it, by the Agency of a Spirit coming in Apparition to a third Per|&s;on, &s;o to bring it about as in the ordinary Me|thod, what have we to do to di&s;pute the man|ner? or what ju&s;t Objection lies again&s;t it?</P>
<P>UPON the whole, here's no <HI>Devil</HI> here, no ima|ginary Phantoms in the Air, no Voices and Noi&s;es delu&s;ive and impo&s;ing upon the Fancy one way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> other; no Soul appearing, and pretending it can|not be at re&s;t; and yet here is an Apparition di|recting to find out what was in Being, and was to be found, and what Ju&s;tice required &s;hould be produc'd.</P>

NOR could this be the <HI>Devil:</HI> that wicked A|gent goes up and down upon a much wor&s;e Em|ployment.

<P>INDEED it might not have been improper to have repre&s;ented tho&s;e two worthy Gentlemen as Apparitions, for that they are &s;uch is a mo&s;t im|proving Truth, and what it may be much for the Service of the World to have publickly known: But as we are now &s;peaking of Apparitions which repre&s;ent Men and things as they really are, it &s;eems fir&s;t needful to bring their in&s;ides to be their out&s;ides, and then the World may know them by their &s;hadows as well as by their &s;ub&s;tance; and for this I doubt we mu&s;t wait a while, the I&s;&s;ue of an A&s;&s;izes or two; for certainly, if Ju&s;tice takes place, they may both be heard of at the Gallows.</P>
<P>BUT to bring it home to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I in&s;i&s;t that no Man can be deceiv'd in him&s;elf; he may know whether he is a Knave or an hone&s;t Man, whether he is a Sub&s;tance, or an Apparition, whether he be a Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lity or a Shadow; and that <HI>Ja|cob Behemen</HI> advanc'd only a Delu&s;ion proper for a Knave, pretending that a Man might be hone&s;t when he believ'd him&s;elf to be a Knave, and be a Knave when he thought him&s;elf hone&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Affair of the Writing found in the Che&s;t, and which, according to the Notion which &s;ome have of the&s;e things, the Soul of the antient Gentlemen above came in Apparition to di&s;cover; our Que&s;tion is fir&s;t How did he come to know in his determin'd State, his State of Soul|Exi&s;tence,
<PB N="311" REF="328">
be that where it would, I &s;ay, How did he come to know, that the Writing was not di&s;cover'd, and that his Grand&s;on was in danger of coming to any injury about it? How did he know that the Law-Suit was commenc'd, the thing pro&s;ecuted &s;o far, and the damage like to be &s;uffer'd &s;o very much?</P>
<P>HE might know where it was, if not found; becau&s;e he hid it there, becau&s;e he laid it up with &s;o much care; but he could not know what Cir|cum&s;tance had been attending the ca&s;e &s;ince that time, what proceedings had been at Law, and how things &s;tood with the Family; if he could, then the Text quoted before out of <HI>Job</HI> cannot be true, that <HI>the Son ri&s;eth and falleth, and the Father knoweth it not.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS ob&s;ervable that this Apparition, which came to Doctor <HI>Scot,</HI> did not alledge that he could not re&s;t 'till this matter was di&s;cover'd; he &s;eem'd con|cern'd that the Family would be unea&s;y, and that they were &s;o; and that there was great danger, they might lo&s;e the E&s;tate; but did not pretend he could not re&s;t in Peace, or as the other, that he could not go to Heaven 'till it was di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but wonder a little at the Ignorance of the Ancients, in that Notion of the Soul's wan|dring in the Air all the while the Body was with|out a Funeral Ob&s;equy; for according to their Do|ctrine, tho&s;e Souls who had no &s;uch Funeral Pyre prepared for them, mu&s;t have been wandring in the Air to this Day, and will be &s;o for ever; not be|ing able to get admittance either in one place or other.</P>
<P>NO wonder the Air is &s;aid to be &s;o fill'd with wandring Spirits, with Daemons and Gho&s;ts, as &s;ome are of the Opinion it is; for where mu&s;t all the Millions of Spirits be gone, who have lain without Burial, or been ca&s;t into the Sea, or been
<PB N="312" REF="329">
overwhelm'd with Earthquakes and Storms, or died by Plagues, where the living have nor been &s;uffici|ent to bury the dead? and the like in many publick Calamities.</P>
<P>I KNOW the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks have a way of performing a Service for the dead by Thou&s;ands; and in particular for the Souls of the dead, &s;lain in &s;uch and &s;uch a Battel: whether that has any relati|on to this old Pagan Notion, or not, I will not &s;ay. I know Popery has pretty much of the Pagan in their Original, I mean of their Wor&s;hip; but will &s;aying one Service for the dead an&s;wer the End, whether they have any Burial or no, and tho' their Bodies are left, as <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Hector,</HI> for greedy or hungry Dogs to rend? This they do not an&s;wer, and I doubt cannot; &s;o that perhaps all tho&s;e Souls kill'd in fight are wandring &s;till in the Air, and can|not have admittance, no not to the Shades below.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if the poor Soldiers be|liev'd, that if they were kill'd in fight, they were to wander for ever, and not be pray'd out of Pur|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ory; nay, not be admitted into it; few of them but would chu&s;e to be hang'd, provided they might be admitted to be bury'd under the Gallows, rather than go to the War and die in the Bed of Honour.</P>
<P>THEY tell us (who pretend to know) that the Corps of the deceas'd Princes of <HI>France,</HI> as well Kings as Princes of the Blood, are not buried, but depo&s;ited in the Abbey of St. <HI>Dennis</HI> near <HI>Paris,</HI> 'till the immediate Succe&s;&s;or is Dead; and that then the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;&s;or is buried, and the next is de|po&s;ited; &s;o that there is always one kept above Ground.</P>
<P>I DO not take upon me to determine the Matter, or to &s;ay whether it is really &s;o or not: But if &s;o, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> that tho&s;e H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">roes are then to be out of the happy Regions,
<PB N="313" REF="330">
I mu&s;t &s;ay their Kings are but little behold|en to that Cu&s;tom, and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII had a hard time of it, to have his Son hold it 70 Years, and keep him all that while even out of Purgatory; and how long he has to &s;tay there, who knows? but 'tis c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">tain, he might have been 40 or 50 Years onward of his way by this time, if he had not been &s;o many Years unburied.</P>
<P>BUT enough of this Pagan and Popi&s;h Frippery: our bu&s;ine&s;s is to talk to the more rational World; their Fate is before them; all Men die, and after Death to Judgment, nothing can interrupt it, and what their Sons do or &s;uffer behind them they know not.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the Con&s;equence of this Doctrine; and &s;ee|ing that Apparitions are real, and may be ex|pected upon many Occa&s;ions, and that we are &s;ure they are not the Souls of our departed Friends; how are we to act, and how to behave to them, when they come among us, and when they pretend to be &s;uch and &s;uch, and &s;peak in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of tho&s;e depart|ed Friends, as if they were really them|&s;elves?</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus &s;ettled the main point, and de|termin'd what Apparition is not; namely, not an Angel immediately from Heaven; not a return'd unembodied Soul; and having advanc'd, in E&s;&s;ay at lea&s;t, what we are to &s;uppo&s;e them to be; namely, a good or evil Spirit from the Invi&s;ible World; and having &s;ettled the Rule of judging whether of
<PB N="314" REF="331">
the two, whether a good or an evil, according to the apparent good or evil of their De&s;ign; it is time now to bring the matter into Practice; to &s;et|tle the grand Preliminary, and determine, &s;ince this is their Behaviour to us, how we are to behave to them.</P>
<P>NOR is this a needle&s;s Enquiry, for we find the World at a great lo&s;s on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. Men are exceedingly terrified and di&s;corded upon the very Apprehen&s;ions of &s;eeing any thing <HI>as they call it</HI> from the Invi&s;ible World; even the great King <HI>Bel&s;hazzar,</HI> tho' in the mid&s;t of his whole Court, the Lords of 127 Provinces, a full A&s;&s;embly of La|dies and Courtiers; yet when he &s;aw but a piece of an Apparition, (for it was but one Hand) yet <HI>his Countenance chang'd, and the joynts of his Knees were loo&s;ed, and his Knees &s;mote one again&s;t another,</HI> Dan. v. 6. <HI>Charles</HI> VIII of <HI>France</HI> was not frighted only, but frighted out of his Wits, with an Appa|rition in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Mans,</HI> and never recover'd his Sen&s;es any more; and we have &s;everal in&s;tances in Story, of Men, even of the greate&s;t Re&s;olution, who have lo&s;t all their Courage, and all their Re|&s;olution, when they have had but a &s;hort Vi&s;it of this kind, tho' without receiving any injury from them.</P>
<P>BUT whence is it, that the Mind is thus &s;ur|priz'd? why is our Aver&s;ion &s;o great to any ap|pearance from the other World, without &s;o much as enquiring into the Particulars?</P>
<P>THERE are many Rea&s;ons indeed to be a&s;&s;ign'd to prove why <HI>it is &s;o;</HI> but not one good Rea&s;on that I know of to prove <HI>it &s;hould be &s;o,</HI> or that we have any Occa&s;ion to be &s;o alarm'd and di&s;turb'd at the&s;e Appearances; I mean, when the Mind has any degree of Compo&s;ure: It is true, they come from an Invi&s;ible Place, and that is one of the Rea&s;ons of our fright; becau&s;e, as we &s;ay, we know not
<PB N="315" REF="332">
whence they are, of what Errand they come, with what Commi&s;&s;ion, and with what Power to execute that Commi&s;&s;ion; all the&s;e uncertainties bring a Ter|ror upon the Spirits; the Soul receives a &s;hock; the Man is like one of tho&s;e poor People where they are in an Earthquake, they &s;ee the Buildings totter and fall before them, and tho' they are not bury'd in the Ruins, but are perhaps e&s;cap'd out into the Fields; yet they feel the Earth roll and move under them, and they are doubtful and apprehen&s;ive le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t they may be &s;wallowed up every Moment; and, accord|ing to the old Poet, it is Matter of real Terror;
<Q><L>"Fear chills the Heart, what Heart can Fear di&s;|&s;emble,</L>
<L>"When Steeples &s;tagger, and when Mountains trem|ble?</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS uncertainty of the Mind in the ca&s;e of Apparitions, is the real ground of Fear; <HI>(viz.)</HI> that we know not</P>
<P>WHENCE their Errand comes, WHAT Commi&s;&s;ion they have, WHAT Power to execute the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> WE don't know whence they are, and from whom their Errand, nor indeed can we be ea&s;ie in the uncertainty: The rea&s;on is, there is a &s;ecret doubt of the Mind, founded upon Guilt: Here the Athei&s;t bauks his a&s;&s;urance, and tho' he pretends to believe neither God or <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;taggers at a Me&s;&s;en|ger that comes for ought he knows from one or both of them, to convince him by immediate de|mon&s;tration. Here his Heart fails him, he turns pale, &s;tarts at the &s;ight, and would be glad to be a&s;&s;ur'd there were really both, that one might pro|tect him from the other.</P>
<P>WHILE he knows not whether the Me&s;&s;age comes from Heaven or Hell, whether the Me&s;&s;enger
<PB N="316" REF="333">
may be Angel or <HI>Devil,</HI> the uncertainty attend|ed with the real Danger of the wor&s;t, leaves him in Horror, and he fears Hell becau&s;e he knows he has provok'd Heaven, he fears the <HI>Devil</HI> becau&s;e he knows he that can command the <HI>Devil</HI> is his E|nemy.</P>
<P>IN a Word, a &s;en&s;e of God makes men afraid of the <HI>Devil,</HI> as they &s;ay fear of the <HI>Devil</HI> gives a &s;en&s;e of Homage to God.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> WE tremble at the Me&s;&s;en|ger, becau&s;e we don't know what his Me&s;&s;age may be; we dread the Officer, becau&s;e we dread his Commi&s;&s;ion; we are afraid of what he has to &s;ay; we know we have no rea&s;on to expect good News from the place, which we &s;uppo&s;e he comes from, and therefore we turn pale at his coming, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are but two Principles that fortifie the Mind again&s;t the Fears of a future State, no not that &s;eeming<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y fortifie it; and the&s;e are,</P>
<P N="1">1. INNOCENCE, or a good Heart founded in Religion, Virtue, and an exact rectitude of beha|viour. OR,</P>
<P N="2">2. IMPUDENCE, a harden'd &s;hutting the Eyes again&s;t Conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ction, and the Ears again&s;t Con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>IT is with &s;ome Perplexity that I found my &s;elf oblig'd to give a Character in another place of a fam'd Man of pretended Brightne&s;s and Wit: He was always merry, a con&s;tant Smile &s;at upon his Countenance, a perfect ea&s;ine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s'd his Mind, he knew not a Moment of Melancholly or Cha|grin. He never &s;igh'd, becau&s;e he &s;eldom pray'd or griev'd; I wi&s;h I could have &s;aid, becau&s;e he ne|ver &s;inn'd. His Heart was light as his Head; and as for his Heels, he always walk'd in Minuit and Ri|gadoons. His Mirth was as uninterrupted as his Breath, and he laugh'd by the Con&s;equence of Re&s;piration;
<PB N="317" REF="334">
his Voice was a natural Mu&s;ic, and his Rhetoric was all Sonnet and Solfa's.</P>
<P>SURE, &s;aid I, my Cou&s;in <HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>D</HI>&mdash;mu&s;t have the cleare&s;t Con&s;cience in the Univer&s;e, he has not the lea&s;t <HI>Scar</HI> upon his In&s;ide; and if he was to &s;ee the <HI>Devil,</HI> he could not change Colour, or have the lea&s;t He&s;itation at the mo&s;t frightful Ap|pearance: He mu&s;t be all Innocence and Virtue.</P>
<LG>
<L>Did the lea&s;t Spot upon his Soul appear,</L>
<L>It could not be: his Con&s;cience mu&s;t be clear:</L>
<L>For where there's Guilt, there always would be Fear.</L>
</LG>
<P>BUT I mi&s;took my Kin&s;man mo&s;t extremely, for on the contrary, his Soul is blacker than <HI>Negro Sancho,</HI> the Beauty of <HI>Africa;</HI> he boa&s;ts him&s;elf of the mo&s;t harden'd Crime, defies Heaven, de&s;pi&s;es Ter|ror, and is got above Fear by the meer force of a flagrant A&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>HE would no more value &s;eeing the <HI>Devil</HI> in his mo&s;t fiery formidable Appearance, than he would to &s;ee a &s;torm of Fire in <HI>the Tempe&s;t,</HI> or a Harle|quin <HI>Diable</HI> in <HI>Fre&s;co;</HI> if you will take his Character from him&s;elf, he has no more fear about him, than he has Con&s;cience, and that's &s;o little, 'tis not worth naming. He knows no Sorrow, no Chagrin; he was born Laughing, and intends to die Je&s;ting: and what is all this founded upon? not glorious Inno|cence mention'd above, but notorious Impudence.</P>
<P>IT'S true indeed, I had not car'd to &s;peak &s;o gro&s;ly of one of my near Relations, but he will have it be &s;o; he &s;peaks it of him&s;elf, bids me take notice of it, that 'tis the Character he gives me of him&s;elf, and d&mdash;s me with a full Stream of <HI>Bil|lin&s;gate,</HI> if I dare to give any other Character of him than what he gives of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I MUST acknowledge I did believe the <HI>Devil</HI> and my Cou&s;in were not much at Strife, that he did
<PB N="318" REF="335">
not fear the old Dragon, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cau&s;e he had never done any thing to di&s;oblige him; but it &s;eems the Ca&s;e differs, and he defies the <HI>Devil</HI> purely upon the &s;ame foot that he defies him that made the <HI>Devil;</HI> and acts the Fury meerly as a Fury, not as a Man of Sen&s;e or as a Man of Courage.</P>
<P>ALL that I have to &s;ay to this, is, that this will la&s;t ju&s;t 'till the Rage is abated, and no longer; 'till the Blood cools, and the Spirits return to their na|tural Cour&s;e, and then the Wretch will be as cold as now he is hot, as calm as now he is outragious, and as ba&s;e and low-&s;pirited as now he is fiery and furious.</P>
<P>ALL the hot-headed Courage of the&s;e Men, is only a Fla&s;h, a Meteor in the Air; when they are cool'd, when the Exhalation is &s;pent, they are as phlegmatic as other People; and then they look pale, the Countenance changes, and the Knees knock one again&s;t another, as well as other People's.</P>
<P>THERE'S no &s;corning the Terrors of a Me&s;&s;en|ger from the other World, but by a &s;ettled e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Compo&s;ure of the Soul; founded on the Ba|&s;is of Peace within, Peace of Con&s;cience, Peace and Innocence, or Peace and Penitence, which is in effect all one: This is the only Face that a Man can hold up to the <HI>Devil;</HI> with a clean Heart, he may boldly &s;ee the <HI>Devil,</HI> talk to him, de&s;pi&s;e him, and tell him he &s;corns him, for that he has nothing at all to do with him.</P>
<P>BUT this is not our pre&s;ent Condition; few Peo|ple wear this Armour in our days; they neither va|lue it or know the u&s;e of it, and therefore 'tis that we are &s;o full of Terror and Di&s;turbance when we &s;ee the <HI>Devil;</HI> at lea&s;t if we think he has any thing to &s;ay to us.</P>
<P>BUT now for the great Que&s;tion, Why it &s;hould be &s;o? as I &s;aid, 'tis Truth too evident that it is &s;o,
<PB N="319" REF="336">
but to &s;ay that it <HI>&s;hould be &s;o,</HI> that requires another kind of Sophi&s;try to make out.</P>
<P>IT is true, it requires a great deal of Courage, and of cool Courage too, in bearing up the Soul again&s;t the Surprize of &s;uch things as the&s;e; a Man mu&s;t be able to talk to the <HI>Devil</HI> in a Dialect which he <HI>(Satan)</HI> him&s;elf does not very well under&s;tand, to bid him be gone, to bid him <HI>Get thee behind me,</HI> and the like; 'tis an authoritative way of talking that every one cannot &s;upport; and if the <HI>Devil</HI> is &s;en&s;ible of it, he will not fail to exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, to maintain the Right which he &s;eems to enjoy, and keep the Hold he has gotten; for he knows how ill his Cau&s;e is to be defended by Ju|&s;tice and Rea&s;on, and if he &s;hould an&s;wer as he did to the Sons of <HI>Scev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> what then if you &s;hould &s;ay to him, in the vulgar and ignorant Dia|lect of &s;peaking to Spirits, In the Name of the <HI>Father,</HI> and of the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Who art thou? or, I charge thee in the Name of the <HI>Father,</HI> &amp;c. to be gone, and di&s;turb me no more.</P>
<P>I SAY, if the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould an&s;wer, The <HI>Father</HI> I know, and the <HI>Son</HI> I know, and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> I know, but who are you, you that pretend to u&s;e their Names thus? What would you &s;ay for your &s;elf?</P>
<P>NOW that we may know how to an&s;wer the <HI>Devil,</HI> as well as how to &s;peak to him, (for both are very nece&s;&s;ary) let me enter into the State of the Ca&s;e a little, between the <HI>Devil</HI> and us; nay, be|tween all the Inhabitants of the invi&s;ible World, and their Friends in this, let them be who, or of what kind they will.</P>
<P>FIRST, In order to be free from the Surprize of the&s;e things, you mu&s;t endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h your Mind in the right under&s;tanding of the thing call'd Apparition; that you may rea&s;on your &s;elf into a &s;ufficient Firmne&s;s, and Steadine&s;s of Soul
<PB N="320" REF="337">
again&s;t all the whim&s;ical and imaginary Part of it.</P>
<P>LET us think of things as they are, not as they are only imagined, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be; for 'tis the Reality of the thing, not the Shadow, that can fright and di&s;order us, that is to &s;ay, that can have any ju&s;t Rea&s;on to do &s;o.</P>
<P>FOR want of this we are often &s;cared and terri|fy'd with Dreams and Vi&s;ions, even when we are awake, and when really there is no &s;uch thing in Sub&s;tance or Reality as any Vi&s;ion or Apparition, other than Apprehen&s;ion throws in upon us, and other than our bewitched Imagination repre&s;ents to us.</P>
<P>IT is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, if you would not be al|ways looking over your Shoulders, and always form|ing Spectres to your Fancy: I &s;ay, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to have a right Notion of Apparition in general; to know what it is, and what it mu&s;t be, whence it comes, and what the utmo&s;t of its Commi&s;&s;ion can be; that you may think your &s;elf into a true and clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Under&s;tanding of it, and then your Fears about it will be regulated after another manner. For Example:</P>
<P N="1">1. ESTABLISH your Mind in this particular and fundamental Article, that whatever appears it mu&s;t be either <HI>a good Spirit</HI> from the invi&s;ible World, an Agent of Mercy, a Me&s;&s;enger of Peace, and con&s;equently <HI>will do</HI> you no Hurt: OR,</P>
<P N="2">2. AN <HI>evil Spirit,</HI> an Agent of Hell from Satan's Region and Empire, the Air; and that &s;o what|ever evil De&s;ign or evil Me&s;&s;age he pretends to come about, and however mi&s;chievous his Inten|tion is, he <HI>cannot</HI> do the Hurt he de&s;ires, becau&s;e that as the good Spirits are under Direction, &s;o the bad are under Limitation; the one <HI>will not,</HI> and the other <HI>cannot</HI> hurt you, without an imme|diate Command from above. The Fear therefore
<PB N="321" REF="338">
which we have upon us concerning Apparition, is not or ought not to be guided by their Appear|ance, but by the rectitude of our own Thoughts; and as we are or are not quiet and calm within, &s;o we &s;hall or &s;hall not be under Apprehen&s;ions from without.</P>
<P>FORTIFY your Minds then with a &s;teady Con|fidence in the Supreme Maker and Governour of all things, who has the great red Dragon in a Chain; and when you think you &s;ee the <HI>Devil,</HI> fear nothing, for He will never let loo&s;e the De|&s;troyer upon any one who&s;e Mind is &s;teadily fix'd upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS is a critical, and perhaps a too curious Piece of Practice for me to meddle with, e&s;peci|ally here, and mu&s;t be but gently touch'd at; you will, it may be, object too again&s;t the Doctrine of it, and &s;ay, Who can &s;o effectually tru&s;t in God, as not to be at all afraid of the <HI>Devil?</HI> Now, tho' this may &s;eem true upon many Accounts, and, as Times go with us, may be really a ju&s;t Obje|ction, yet, if we will believe Hi&s;tory or Experi|ence, it is not &s;o much a Difficulty as to &s;ay Who can do it? for it has been done.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER the known and famous Story of a Maid under a real and per&s;onal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Devil,</HI> at <HI>Little Gad&s;den</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> tho' by an unhappy Di&s;appointment I was not pre&s;ent, not knowing of the thing time enough; yet I &s;aw and convers'd with &s;everal that were pre&s;ent and heard the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;peak in the Maid and by the Or|gan of her Voice, tho' without any apparent Motion of her Tongue or Lips, or any Part of her Mouth.</P>
<P>OF this Per&s;on it was po&s;itively true, that there was a certain good Man, tho' a Lay Chri&s;tian, who &s;o frequently pray'd with the poor Demoniack, being a Neighbour of her Father's, and &s;o con&s;tantly talk'd to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and batter'd

<P>THERE is indeed a right worthy and commend|able State of Indifference, not only as to Who &s;hall or &s;hall not vi&s;it us from the invi&s;ible World, and from what Part of it they come; but al&s;o as to what Station we are to have among them hereafter; and this happy Temper is much recommended to me by &s;ome of my fa&s;hionable Friends, as a mo&s;t de&s;irable Condition of Life: to be perfectly ea&s;y, void of Anxiety and Perplexities of any kind, and forming the mo&s;t perfect Compo&s;ure of Soul that can be imagined.</P>
<P>THEY de&s;cribe this the mo&s;t accurately indeed by the Practice, for they &s;ay mo&s;t feelingly, that

no Tongue can expre&s;s the Felicity of it; which indeed I believe is very true; they are perfectly ea&s;y about, becau&s;e thoughtle&s;s of, that dull remote thing called Futurity. As for there being a State of Life, or a Something like Life after Death, they can't &s;ay but it may be &s;o, for they never enquired much in|to the Principles of the <HI>Saduces,</HI> or into any other Pricinciples about it.

<P>THIS is certainly a mighty brief Way with their Doubts, and a &s;hort an&s;wer to all Enquiries; and I mu&s;t own 'tis putting a &s;hort end to all Di&s;putes with them&s;elves, about the thing called a <HI>future State.</HI></P>

<P>HERE my Friend and I ended, for in&s;tead of being touch'd with it, he talk'd prophanely, and then I always think 'tis time to leave off talking at all; for when Men give up their Rea&s;on to Athei&s;m, and their Sen&s;e of GOD to Bla&s;phemy, who &s;hall labour to wa&s;h that <HI>Ethiop?</HI></P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame in the Ca&s;e before me; here is an Apparition, or &s;uppo&s;e it; the Man that &s;ees it is utterly unconcerned about it; he cares not one Farthing whether it comes from above or from below, whether it be an Angel or a <HI>Devil,</HI> a Me&s;|&s;enger from Hell or from Heaven; and &s;o this Man is not afraid of it, but boldly goes up to it, and like a Soldier cries, Who are you for?

<P>I COME next to the Enquiry, What is our bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and how &s;hould we behave if it is our mi&s;|fortune to have any &s;uch Appearance come to us? and &s;uppo&s;e our Minds to be as much compos'd as ordinarily may be expected, not more than our Neighbours; but what, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> &s;hall we do, and what is the be&s;t cour&s;e for us to take?</P>
<P>IN my Opinion, and it is the next Advice I would give, I &s;ay next to that of fortifying the Mind with religious Con&s;iderations, of which I have &s;poken, and which &s;hould always go fir&s;t, <HI>&s;peak to it.</HI></P>
<P>BY &s;peaking to it, my meaning is, Speak tho' it does not &s;peak to you. I have heard of &s;ome Ap|paritions, who 'tis &s;aid, had no power to &s;peak 'till they were fir&s;t &s;poken to, and &s;ome ca&s;es of that kind are publi&s;h'd by tho&s;e who I &s;uppo&s;e believ'd them; tho' I &s;ee no rea&s;on to do &s;o; and particularly of an Apparition that cau&s;ed a poor Man to follow it over Hedge and Ditch all Night for many a Night

together, 'till the poor Man was almo&s;t hurry'd to Death; but could not &s;peak to him, and the frighted Wretch was afraid to &s;peak to it; but at la&s;t the Man &s;poke, and then the Apparition's Mouth was loo&s;ed too: all which I mu&s;t con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s I &s;ee no man|ner of rea&s;on to believe, and therefore cannot re|commend it to any body el&s;e to believe.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems no Con&s;i&s;tency in the Nature of the thing, no foundation for it in Religion, or any thing in it that we can Rea&s;on upon for our own Under&s;tanding; and where neither Nature, Religion or Rea&s;on allow us any Light in it, upon what Principle can we go to make our Judgment?</P>
<P>BUT leaving it therefore where we find it, I &s;ay if you &s;ee an Apparition, that is &s;uch an Appa|rition as we have been &s;peaking of, not a Phan|to&s;m of your own Brain, not an imaginary Apparition the effect of Fright or Dream, or meer Whim&s;ie, not a Hypocondriack Apparition, the effect of Va|pours and Hy&s;terick Shadows, when the Eye &s;ees double, and Imagination makes it &s;elf a Tele&s;cope to the Soul, not to &s;how Realities, but to magnify Objects at the remote&s;t di&s;tance, and &s;how things as in being which are not, if you &s;ee &s;uch an Ap|parition as this and &s;peak to it, 'tis no wonder you receive no an&s;wer, and &s;o you go away more frighted with a &s;ilent dumb <HI>Devil</HI> than you would be with a &s;peaking one; but I &s;ay, if the Vi&s;ion be real, if it be a Shape and Appearance in form as has been de&s;crib'd, never &s;hun it and fly from it; but <HI>&s;peak to it.</HI></P>
<P>IF you would ask me what you &s;hould &s;ay to it, 'tis an unfair Que&s;tion in &s;ome Re&s;pects; 'tis not po&s;&s;ible for any one to dictate, without the proper Circum&s;tances be de&s;crib'd. The old way you all know: <HI>In the name of,</HI> &amp;c. as above, is the common road. I will not cry down the Cu&s;tom, becau&s;e 'tis the u&s;ual way, and the words are good; but I believe
<PB N="328" REF="345">
a &s;incere mental Ejaculatory Prayer to the Ble&s;&s;ed Being of Beings for his &s;uperior Pre&s;ence, would be as effectual as pre&s;enting the Words to the <HI>Devil</HI> as a kind of Exorci&s;m; &s;uch a Petition &s;ent up, and then a plain <HI>what are you?</HI> I think is Compliment enough for the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>AN hone&s;t, plain, religious <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> who I knew, and who thought he &s;aw the <HI>Devil,</HI> tho' he was mi&s;taken too, yet had this (to me) perfectly new Expre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;urpri&s;e, <HI>the Lord be between me and thee, Satan awa,</HI> that is go away, or get thee away: 'twas certainly a good thought, and the poor Man was right, for if the Lord was between him and the <HI>Devil</HI> there was no great need to fear him or any of his.</P>
<P>BUT to wave particular In&s;tructions in the ca&s;e, the Occa&s;ion will certainly admini&s;ter the Sub&s;tance of what you &s;hould &s;ay; the pre&s;ent Direction is only in general, <HI>&s;peak to it,</HI> never &s;ink under the Terror or Surprize of the &s;ight. The <HI>Devil</HI> is rarely &s;een in his own Shape, and ordinarily for ends of his own, he chu&s;es to appear in familiar Shapes, per&s;onating &s;ome or other that we know, or have known, and repre&s;enting to our Fancy &s;omething that will not terrify us; nay, 'tis the Opinion of the learned Divines, that the <HI>Devil</HI> would do much le&s;s harm, and be far le&s;s dangerous, if he appear'd as a meer <HI>Devil,</HI> with his Horns, his cloven Hoof, and his Serpent's Tayl and Dragon's Wings, as Fancy figures him out, and as our Painters dre&s;s him up, than he does in his di&s;gui&s;es, and the many Shapes and Figures he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>So fatal are Ma&s;ques and Di&s;gui&s;es, Habits and Dre&s;&s;es to the World, and &s;uch advantage does a fal&s;e Countenance give to Criminal Perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rmances of many kinds, that even the <HI>Devil</HI> is more dangerous dre&s;s'd up in Ma&s;querade, than in his own Cloaths, and in his own Colours; if he would come in all
<PB N="329" REF="346">
his Formalities and Frightfuls, he would not be capable of half &s;o many Cou&s;inings and Cheatings as he now puts upon us: now you have him here and have him there, you have him every where and no where, he is here a Tempter to Wickedne&s;s, there a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; to-day in one di&s;gui&s;e, to-morrow in another; you know him and you don't know him, &s;ee him and don't &s;ee him, and how then can any one tell you what to &s;ay to him, or how to talk with him?</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to come as near to it as we can, the fir&s;t and ordinary Que&s;tion, natural to the Occa&s;ion, is to know who he is, and whence he comes, what Me&s;&s;age he has to deliver, what Bu|&s;ine&s;s he comes about, and what you have to do with it, why he di&s;turbs you in particular, and the like; and if you may obtain &s;o much Civility from him, to de&s;ire him to trouble you no more; e&s;pecially if you find the Apparition to be of the wor&s;t kind.</P>
<P>IF it is apparently a good Spirit, I think the Conduct &s;hould differ, as the Me&s;&s;age he comes about will certainly differ; if it warns you to repent of &s;uch and &s;uch a &s;candalous Life; or if it bids you reform &s;uch and &s;uch a criminal Practice, which you know your &s;elf guilty of; accept the kind Admo|nition, &s;ubmit to the Reproof, and promi&s;e Obedience; you may depend, as I have often &s;aid, the <HI>Devil</HI> com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of no &s;uch Errand.</P>
<P>IF it tells you &s;uch and &s;uch Dangers attend you, take the kind hint, and u&s;e the proper means to avoid th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m, thankfully acknowledging the Good|ne&s;s of the Hand that &s;ent the Notice, as well as the Me&s;&s;enger that brought it; for depend upon it the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is a Lover and Author, as well as the Promoter of Mi&s;chief, takes no Pains to prevent it, but would rather have a Hand in bringing it upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="347">
AND if &s;uch things as the&s;e are the Subject of the Me&s;&s;age, what can you &s;ay why you &s;hould be afraid of the Me&s;&s;enger? 'Tis hard to rejoice in the Me&s;&s;age, and be &s;car'd at the Me&s;&s;enger: the truth is, we are not much accu&s;tom'd to &s;uch &s;olemn Admonitions, &s;uch good and beneficent Cautions and A&s;&s;i&s;tances; and this makes the thing &s;trange and aweful, and be receiv'd with Terror and Fright, and perhaps if it was not &s;o we &s;hould receive them oftner.</P>
<P>WE do not find the old Patriarchs, or after them, the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> were &s;o frighted at the Apparition of Angels and Spirits; it's true in|deed when the Angel appear'd to <HI>Gideon</HI> at the Thre&s;hing-Floor, it is &s;aid he was troubled at his Pre&s;ence; neverthele&s;s the Me&s;&s;age was kind and encouraging; yet we find he recover'd him&s;elf, and took Courage to talk very particularly with it, and to expo&s;tulate with him about the Circum&s;tances of his Country, and of the People, and even to ask a double Sign from the Angel to confirm his Faith: and how went he on? he obey'd the Voice of the Vi&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding all his Fears and Doubts, and he bow'd his Soul, and follow'd the Directions given him.</P>
<P>THERE are abundance of Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould li&s;ten to &s;uch Apparitions as the&s;e; their di&s;tingui&s;hing Character is, that they always come of &s;ome Errand or other for the good of Man|kind; take it either in general, or in particular: Sometimes 'tis alledg'd they come upon trifling and mean Occa&s;ions, as is the Ca&s;e in many In&s;tances given in Story, and in Print. But it may be an|&s;wered with an Enquiry, Are we &s;ure the&s;e are not trifling Stories, and brought in by Per&s;ons, perhaps, but half informed? But what are we to think of the Apparition to King <HI>James</HI> V. in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who warn'd him again&s;t his <HI>Flodden-Field</HI> Expedition?

<P>AND what &s;hall we &s;ay of the Warning given to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> by the Apparition of his own Father, which if he had li&s;ten'd to, 'tis very likely he had e&s;cap'd the fatal Knife? for <HI>Fel|ton,</HI> who A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him, did it, as it &s;eems he declar'd at the Gibbet, upon the Account of the Popular Hatred, and that he thought him a pub|lick Enemy to his Country.</P>
<P>THESE, and many more which I have men|tion'd, or which I have not mention'd, have been the Subject of &s;uch Me&s;&s;engers, and were far from trifling. If an Appari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion gives any of us Notice of our approaching End, and bids us prepare for it, is not the Me&s;&s;age &s;olemn, and the Occa&s;ion of it weighty; and is not the Notice worth our Regard? Is the Preparation for Death a trifling thing? and the a&s;&s;urance how near the time is can|not but be a valuable Notice; I am &s;ure it ought to be e&s;teem'd &s;o.</P>
<P>A FLOUTING athei&s;tick Man of Wit, who mu&s;t be namele&s;s, becau&s;e he will not bear to be nam'd to the Crimes which he is not a&s;ham'd to commit, told me, when di&s;cour&s;ing this Part of the Subject, that it was no Kindne&s;s at all, for that Men ought always to be prepar'd for Death; and yet cou'd not deny but that it was a remote Affair which he had not yet given him&s;elf the trouble to think about.</P>

<P>NOW a kind Me&s;&s;enger comes, as the Prophet did to <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and &s;ays, Prepare your&s;elf, for you &s;hall die, and not live; is this Me&s;&s;age to be &s;light|ed and di&s;regarded? If it is &s;o treated 'tis at your Peril, you take that Part upon your&s;elf; and if you find this the Ca&s;e, you will hardly call the Me&s;|&s;age trifling, much le&s;s &s;ay &s;uch Apparitions ge|nerally come upon trifling Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>HISTORY records a great many foreboding Signs, and &s;ome by Apparition, foretelling the De|&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and of the Temple; not that any of tho&s;e Signs could be &s;uppos'd to give Warn|ing of it, &s;o as that it might be prevented; for our Saviour had expre&s;ly &s;aid it &s;hould be de|&s;troy'd, <HI>Their Hou&s;e &s;hould be left unto them de&s;olate,</HI> Matt. xxiii. 38. <HI>Not one Stone left upon another which &s;hall not be thrown down,</HI> Matt. xxiv. 2. But tho&s;e Signs and Apparitions were apparent Warnings
<PB N="334" REF="351">
to the People, at lea&s;t to &s;uch of them as had the Wi&s;dom to take Notice of them, to make their E&s;cape out of the City before the <HI>Romans</HI> inve&s;ted it, and before it was too late; particularly the opening the great brazen Doors of the Temple, which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays twenty Man could &s;carce turn to open or &s;hut, and which opening of them&s;elves, an Apparition was &s;een in the Hou&s;e of GOD, and a Voice heard, &s;aying, <HI>Let us Depart hence.</HI></P>
<P>NO que&s;tion, but as the Warning or Alarm was given to direct many to their E&s;cape, &s;o many had that Wi&s;dom given them as to make their E&s;cape; and tho' the De&s;olation was horrible, and &s;uch as perhaps was never equall'd, except in the &s;ame Place, and the &s;ame Country, by the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> when the fir&s;t Temple was burnt; yet, as they &s;ay 'tis a hard Battle where none e&s;cape, &s;o <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> him&s;elf owns, that many Thou&s;ands, and others &s;ay many hundreds of thou&s;ands fled in time, and made their E&s;cape, flying, as the Text &s;ays, <HI>from the Wrath to come.</HI> Nor can I doubt but that many had warnings in Dreams, that is, as I &s;ay, by Appa|ritions in Dream, by Vi&s;ions, and &s;ome by open Ap|paritions, that the City would be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><HI>RABBI JUDAH</HI> &s;ays, the Patriarchs ap|peared to many, and gave them Notice, that the <HI>Romans</HI> would come and be&s;iege their City, and that the Temple &s;hould be de&s;troyed; but I doubt much of the Story, and that On a double Account. 1. Whether ever any of the Patriarchs did &s;o appear and forewarn them; for had they done &s;o, they would certainly have told them that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was come, and that therefore the &s;econd Temple was to be de&s;troy'd, for that all the Prophe&s;ies were fulfill'd. But, 2. I doubt al&s;o that <HI>Rabbi Judah,</HI> if &s;uch an Author there was, never &s;aid &s;o, and that 'tis only a Tradition.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="352">
IT is certain there were the like Omens, and I doubt not Apparitions too, ju&s;t before the taking and &s;acking of <HI>Rome</HI> by the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> the <HI>Van|dals</HI> and <HI>Goths;</HI> and we might de&s;cend to modern Hi&s;tory for many of the like: &s;o that the&s;e Appari|tions do not always come upon trifling Occa&s;ions, at lea&s;t they are not trifling to tho&s;e whom they re|gard in particular, and therefore 'tis not an Objection for a particular Per&s;on to make.</P>
<P>I HAVE troubled you with none of tho&s;e Appa|ritions, which have come to help you to find out Mo|ney, to reveal little love Secrets and Intrigues, and upon other &s;uch Ca&s;es; nor do I recommend it to you to believe tho&s;e Trifles; they are mo&s;t certainly the Apparitions of Fancy, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve at large in its Place; &s;uch People make a meer Harlequin of the <HI>Devil,</HI> a common Jack-Pudding, to make Game with; 'tis mo&s;t certain, the Spirits I &s;peak of, know how to make them&s;elves be better re|garded, know how to make them&s;elves con&s;idera|ble, can come clothed in Terror if they plea&s;e, and have done &s;o where occa&s;ion has call'd for it; either to enforce their Me&s;&s;age, or alarm &s;uch Per|&s;ons who &s;et up for a hardened Face beyond the Power of invi&s;ible Terrors.</P>
<P>BUT as their Me&s;&s;age is generally peaceable, and the Intent of it kind and good, &s;o they chu&s;e to come in a manner, as little attended with the frightful Part as they can.</P>
<P>BUT not to dwell on this Part, or enquire at all what the Me&s;&s;age is they come about, whe|ther trifling or otherwi&s;e, the pre&s;ent Enquiry is, what is our Part, what is to be done when they do appear: For 'till we &s;ee them, we know nothing of their Bu&s;ine&s;s; nor perhaps when we &s;ee them, un|le&s;s we &s;peak to them; and we have many Stories of Apparitions, that only &s;how them&s;elves, and perhaps it may be never &s;peak at all.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="353">
THIS our People call <HI>Walking,</HI> and indeed it is not improperly call'd &s;o, becau&s;e, as to us, we know no more of their Bu&s;ine&s;s; but it no more follows that they have no other Bu&s;ine&s;s here becau&s;e we don't know it, than that it is likely they &s;hould come hither, and walk to and fro, and have nothing to do.</P>
<P>AS for tho&s;e non-appearing Apparitions, if I may call them &s;o, (for not to appear, and not to let us know what they appear for, &s;eems to be much the &s;ame;) I mean tho&s;e not-&s;peaking Apparitions, we can indeed give no Account of them, becau&s;e we cannot conver&s;e with them: It &s;eems to me they are not of the Heavenly or Angelick Kind, becau&s;e they would certainly have &s;ome more apparent Bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps not be backward to &s;peak of it, at lea&s;t they would not &s;eem to be a&s;hamed of their Errand.</P>
<P>NOR is it my Opinion, that tho&s;e Apparitions who come of good Errands can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be unable to &s;peak, if it was nece&s;&s;ary to their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to u&s;e Speech; much le&s;s that they &s;hould re|ceive their Commi&s;&s;ion or their Ability to &s;peak from our fir&s;t &s;peaking to them: There is no Co|herence in it: But certainly if the Spirits that ap|pear upon good De&s;igns, and come upon good Er|rands, do not &s;peak to us; they are not &s;ent to us; their Bu&s;ine&s;s is with &s;omebody el&s;e, which we know nothing of, tho' we may &s;ee the Spectre; for it may be that a Man may &s;ee an Apparition that has nothing to do with him, or to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>OR perhaps the Spectre may execute its Com|mi&s;&s;ion effectually, without &s;peaking. A Gho&s;t was &s;aid to haunt a certain Hou&s;e in the Country not far from <HI>Rygate</HI> in <HI>Surrey;</HI> it was met in the Gar|den by one of the Family, who had long valued him&s;elf upon believing, and &s;aying al&s;o, that there were no &s;uch things as Apparitions, and that he
<PB N="337" REF="354">
would be &s;ure of it when-ever he met &s;uch a thing, he would know what it was made of before he parted with it.</P>
<P>GOING out of the Hou&s;e in the Evening when it was almo&s;t dark, but not quite, he meets the Apparition in the Garden; the Apparition &s;hun'd him, and would not have been &s;een, or made as if it would not have been &s;een. <HI>H A!</HI> &s;ays he boldly, <HI>are you there! What are you?</HI> The Apparition &s;till makes from him, and he &s;peaks again, <HI>Who are you? What is your Name?</HI> &s;ays he, in a kind of je&s;ting manner. <HI>My Bu&s;ine&s;s is not with you,</HI> &s;ays the Apparition. But I have &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s with you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I mu&s;t know what you are, and I will know what you are; and with that, <HI>&s;ays my Story,</HI> (tho' by the way I mu&s;t tell you, I don't know how true 'tis) <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> with that the bold Fellow offers to go up to it and lay Hands upon it; at which it advanced to him and over-run him, bore him down, and threw him again&s;t the Garden Wall, which was at lea&s;t five or &s;ix Yards from him, with &s;uch Violence, that he was taken up for dead; and I &s;uppo&s;e he never ventur'd to lay Hands upon a Spirit or Apparition again.</P>
<P>NOW be this Story true or not, I mention it to warn ra&s;h Heads, who pretending not to fear the <HI>Devil,</HI> are for u&s;ing the ordinary Violences with him, which affect one Man from another, or with an Apparition, in which they may be &s;ure to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ceive &s;ome Mi&s;chief. I knew One fired a Gun at an Apparition, and the Gun bur&s;t in a hundred Pieces in his Hand, (that is in a great many Pieces.)

It is mo&s;t certain that an Apparition or a Spirit is not to be cut with a Sword, or &s;hot with a Gun; as there is no Sub&s;tance, there can be no Wound made; and 'tis next to Madne&s;s for any one to go that way to work, be it Angel or be it <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="355">
BUT to carry this farther: In particular, an Ap|parition may &s;hew it&s;elf, and peform its Mi&s;&s;ion in a full and compleat manner, and yet not &s;peak. I have a Story by me of a Gentleman who carried on a Secret and Criminal Conver&s;ation with a cer|tain Lady, and having made an A&s;&s;ignation to meet the Lady, was met at the Place by an Apparition of his own Mother; &s;he &s;aid nothing, &s;he did not offer to &s;peak, nor did he at fir&s;t know it to be an Apparition. The Gentleman walks about in the Field near a Hou&s;e where he had appointed the Lady to meet; the Apparition walk'd about likewi&s;e, and he takes it to be a Woman in ordi|nary, as any Woman might be &s;een to walk up and down in the &s;ame Field or Walk.</P>
<P>BY and by the Woman or Lady appointed comes, he meets her, and goes forward to &s;alute her; the Apparition &s;hows it&s;elf ju&s;t behind the Lady, and looks him full in the Face; he &s;tarts back from the Lady, and in&s;tead of ki&s;&s;ing her, <HI>cries out,</HI> and asks her, Who's that behind her; &s;he turns about, but &s;ees nobody, nor he neither, which frights them both.</P>
<P>HE fancies it to be an imaginary Vapour, ha|ving no Faith at all in Apparitions, and offers to go up to the Lady again; and behold, he &s;ees the Apparition ju&s;t behind her again, the Face &s;tand|ing ju&s;t &s;o as to look over the Lady's Shoulder, and &s;tare ju&s;t upon him; he cries out again, and knows it to be his Mother, who it &s;eems was dead, and in crying out again, he adds, <HI>My Mother!</HI> at which it vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>HAD this Apparition any occa&s;ion to &s;peak? Was it not Rebuke enough to look him in the Face? Even in common Affairs, a Look from the Eye of one who has Authority to reprove, is &s;ome|times more effectual than the Reproof, if it was given in Words at length.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="356">
SUPPOSE this Spectre to regard him not with a threatning A&s;pect, but with a Countenance of Pity, of a Maternal Reprehen&s;ion, a Reproof urg|ing Shame and Reproach, like that of <HI>Solomon, What, my Son! what, the Son of my Vows! my Son be &s;een embracing a Strumpet!</HI> the Man went away, &s;ays my Story, fill'd with Confu&s;ion; as no que&s;tion indeed but he would.</P>
<P>HERE was no need of Speech; the Look was a La&s;h, and a Reproof &s;ufficient; the Man would hardly meet there any more, if he would meet the &s;ame Lady any more, and 'tis very likely he never did.</P>
<P>'TIS very unhappy in the Ca&s;e before me, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to atte&s;t the Truth of all the Sto|ries which are handed about upon &s;uch a Subject as this is; and therefore tho' I might make Flou|ri&s;hes of the Truth of the Particulars in all Ca&s;es, as others do; I chu&s;e rather to in&s;i&s;t upon the Moral of every Story, whatever the Fact may be, and to inforce the Influence, &s;uppo&s;ing the Hi&s;tory to be real, or whether it be really &s;o or not, which is not much material.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Ca&s;es, however, return me back to the Advice above, namely, always if you &s;ee an Apparition, <HI>&s;peak to it,</HI> &s;peak to it early, and an&s;wer any Que&s;tions it asks, but be &s;ure to ask it no Que|&s;tions except &s;uch as are rea&s;onable, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be within the Reach of its imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">diate Capacity to an&s;wer; no Que&s;tions tending to re|veal the My&s;teries of a future State. To ask &s;uch Que&s;tions as are a plain diving into the Secrets of Heaven, which it is already declared &s;hall not be laid open, is asking the good Spirit, if it be &s;uch, to of|fend on his Part, and is really criminal on your Part; as, to ask what Condition the Per&s;on is in, meaning the Per&s;on who&s;e Shape the Apparition takes up; How he gets Leave to appear here; why he comes
<PB N="340" REF="357">
in this or that Manner; what kind of Place Hea|ven is, and &s;uch like; as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Down</HI> and <HI>Connor</HI> ordered <HI>James Haddock</HI> to ask.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uit your Que&s;tions to what the Spectre &s;hall &s;ay, or as the manner of its Appearance &s;hall direct you; as particularly, if it requires you to do any thing, to &s;peak to any Per&s;on, or to deliver any Admonition to a third Per&s;on, as in the ca&s;e of the Ap|parition about the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and as in the Ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>Scot</HI> and others; you may ju&s;tly ask Tokens by which you may make your &s;elf be be|lieved; al&s;o &s;uch Que&s;tions as relate to your&s;elf, and to the Nature of the thing which the Apparition comes about.</P>
<P>BUT Que&s;tions relating to things beyond Time, curious Enquiries into Futurity and Eternity, are upon many Accounts to be avoided; and for &s;ome Rea&s;ons which I care not to mention in particular; becau&s;e I would not form frightful Ideas in the Minds of tho&s;e that read. I have &s;ome Stories by me which give an Account that upon &s;uch needle&s;s Inquiries the Apparition has turn'd it&s;elf into ter|rifying Appearances, intimating Re&s;entment; not only a Re&s;entment on its own Account, but as if it was an Offence and a high Provocation to the &s;u|preme Power to offer to &s;earch into what Heaven has conceal'd: To me, indeed, it &s;eems it would be &s;o, and therefore 'tis certainly be&s;t to refrain tho&s;e In|quiries.</P>
<P>In a word, the Apparition is, as I may &s;ay, Ag|gre&s;&s;or; it appears; you are pa&s;&s;ive; be &s;o &s;till, other|wi&s;e you make your &s;elf the Apparition, and put the Apparition in your Place: ask it wherefore it appears to you, whether for Good or Evil; if for Evil, call upon God for Protection; if it comes for Good, declare your &s;elf ready to receive its Me&s;&s;age, and to ob&s;erve every ju&s;t Direction, to obey every righteous Command, and attend to what it &s;hall &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="358">
THIS is to act fearle&s;s, and yet cautious; bold, and yet wi&s;ely; re&s;olv'd, and yet humble; and in this Temper of Mind, I think no Man need to be a|fraid of an Apparition.</P>
<P>YOU may re&s;olve all &s;uch things into this; Whe|ther they are good Spirits or bad, Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lick Ap|pearances or Diabolick, they are under &s;uperior Li|mitations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Devil</HI> we know is chain'd, he can go no farther than the length of his Tether; he has not a Hand to act, or a Foot to walk, or a Mouth to &s;peak, but as he is permitted. The Ca&s;e of his Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Job</HI> is explicit; &s;uch and &s;uch things he might do, &s;uch he might not; even the Lives of <HI>Job</HI>'s Children, and Cattle, and Servants were given him; and, like a <HI>Devil</HI> as he was, he went to the full Extent of his Commi&s;&s;ion; he &s;par'd not one of them that he could de&s;troy, but he was forbid to touch the Life of <HI>Job,</HI> and he did not, he dur&s;t not, he could not kill him.</P>
<P>IF then we are &s;ure the <HI>Devil</HI> is re&s;trained from hurting us, any otherwi&s;e than he is directed and limited, we may be &s;ure that good Spirits are; for their Nature, their Bu&s;ine&s;s, their De&s;ires are all fix'd in a general Beneficence to Mankind; their Powers and Employments, as far as they are con|cerned among us, and in things upon this Surface, are included in the heavenly Acclamation when the Angels &s;ung to the Shepherds, <HI>On Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men,</HI> Luk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. ii. 14.</P>
<P>IF at any time they are Me&s;&s;engers of Judgment, Executors of the divine Vengeance, it is likewi&s;e by &s;pecial, nay, by extraordinary Commi&s;&s;ion; and then they are indeed Flames of Fire, and punctual|ly do what they are commanded, and no more.</P>
<P>BUT even then, that we may be ea&s;ie in the matter of Apparition, they do not di&s;gui&s;e them|&s;elves or conceal their Commi&s;&s;ion: As <HI>Manoah</HI>'s Wife &s;aid to him when the Angel appeared to her,

<HI>if the LORD were plea&s;ed to kill us, he would not have received a Burnt-offering, and a Meat-offering at our Hands, neither would HE have &s;hewed us all the&s;e things,</HI> Judges xiii. 23. So here, the Apparition of a good Spirit would not betray us, would not act by Stratagem with us, would not appear in Peace when he means War; come like a Friend, when he was &s;ent for an Enemy; give good Council, when he meant Death and De&s;truction: But if it appears in Peace, its De&s;ign and its Me&s;&s;age is certainly <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole, you have no way any Oc|ca&s;ion to be di&s;turbed at an Appearance, but to regard the Power &s;ending, not the Agent &s;ent; looking beyond the Apparition it&s;elf, and with a re&s;olved Mind, and a &s;teddy, calm Courage, &s;peak to it, and demand its Bu&s;ine&s;s; I do not mean by De|mand, a Demand of In&s;ult and Arrogance, but an humble, yet re&s;olved Enquiry, Why, and on what Occa&s;ion it comes to you.</P>
<P>I HAVE done coun&s;elling. If this Part is too grave for you, as I &s;aid before, it is not very tedious, you may make it a Parenthe&s;is, and the Work will read without it; for why &s;hould I de&s;ire you to do any good thing again&s;t your Will?</P>
<P>IF you don't think there is any thing in it all, if it is not worth your Notice, go on without it; and when you &s;ee any thing, be not &s;urpriz'd and confus'd, cover'd with Horrour and Fright; as is u&s;u|ally the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e who laugh loude&s;t at &s;uch things before they come. <HI>W&mdash;G&mdash;,</HI> E&s;q; famous for that particular Virtue called Impudence, and for that more than ordinary Perfection of it, which &s;ome People call Bla&s;phemy; how m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rry did he u&s;e to make him&s;elf about the ordinary Notions of &s;eeing Apparitions, and hearing People talk of Spirits and the <HI>Devil!</HI></P>

<P>SUCH was the &s;ordid Impo&s;ture of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who having brought up a tame Pidgeon to come to his Ear, where he fed her always with Pea&s;e or Tares, &s;o that &s;he con&s;tantly came thither at his Call; per&s;uaded his Followers that it was an Appa|rition of the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> &s;ent from GOD to whi&s;per divine Oracles into his Soul; and that he received the heavenly In&s;pirations by that means. Such was the Voice which pronounc'd him to be the Prophet of the mo&s;t high GOD, which Voice &s;ounding in the Air, no Per&s;on appearing to &s;peak, was concluded to be the Voice of an Angel, ap|pearing to him, whereas it was &s;poken by his own

<P>SUCH likewi&s;e was the Story of the A&s;s that carry'd him up into Paradi&s;e, and that not only to one, but through &s;even or eight Paradi&s;es or Hea|vens, where he &s;aw two and thirty thou&s;and Vi&s;i|ons: And &s;uch were all the Apparitions which that ridiculous Impo&s;tor feigned to &s;ee upon every Oc|ca&s;ion, 'till his blinded Followers believed him to be an Apparition him&s;elf.</P>
<P>SUCH was the Image of St. <HI>George,</HI> rightly call'd Miraculous, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> to this Day play horrible Pranks with at the I&s;le of <HI>Skyros</HI> in the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> and which they put upon the People as an Apparition indeed; exerci&s;ing particular Seve|rities upon People in &s;everal Ca&s;es: But as it is ma|nag'd by the Prie&s;ts, &s;o 'tis e&s;pecially very furious upon all tho&s;e that neglect to fulfil the Vows made to the &s;aid Saint <HI>George,</HI> or in general to all tho&s;e that do not pay their Debts to the Clergy.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR <HI>Tournefort</HI> in his Voyage into the <HI>Levant</HI> gives a diverting Account of the Conduct of this Devil of <HI>Skyros;</HI> how they worry the Ig|norant People to Death with it, and impo&s;e upon them by it in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and ab&s;urde&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. As there are not greater Impo&s;tors in the World than the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and e&s;pecially the <HI>Greek</HI> Clergy; &s;o there are not a more ignorant, ea&s;ily|impos'd-upon People in the World than the <HI>Greek</HI>
<PB N="347" REF="364">
Layety; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e whom the <HI>Greek</HI> Clergy have to do with: Hence it is, that the mo&s;t ab&s;urd Rea&s;onings go down with them; and indeed they may be truly &s;aid to be <HI>Believers</HI> in the literal &s;en&s;e, for they take all things by the lump, and without rea&s;oning at all upon them: if not, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, as the Prie&s;ts do, with a Be|lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the Image of St. <HI>George</HI> moves the Prie&s;t, not the Prie&s;t the Image, tho' he carries it about upon his Shoulders.</P>
<P>YET this is the fact: The Image of St. <HI>George</HI> is no more than a Picture, and that of very cour&s;e Painting repre&s;enting St. <HI>George</HI> upon a log of Wood; 'tis plac'd over the great Altar of the Ca|thedral at <HI>Skyros,</HI> which is dedicated to that Saint: when the Church is full of People, the Image is &s;een to move of it &s;elf. This they call, and were the fact true, it might well be call'd, the Apparition of St. <HI>George;</HI> but be the Fact true or not, 'tis be|liev'd to be &s;o, and that's as well to all the intents and purpo&s;es of an Apparition, as if the Image were invigorated.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;peak it in their own words, the Image is &s;een to move of it &s;elf, and to &s;how it &s;elf in Apparition to all the People; for notwith&s;tanding its Bulk and Weight, it will tran&s;port it &s;elf through the Air into the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly; there it hovers about, as it were viewing every Face and ex|amining every Heart; if it finds any one that has fail'd to perform any Vow to him (the Saint,) the Image immediately fixes it &s;elf on the Shoulders of the Delinquent, &s;ingles him out, and not only he is expos'd to the whole A&s;&s;embly, but the Image plies him with furious and continued Buffettings, 'till he becomes penitent, and promi&s;es again in the Face of the A&s;&s;embly to pay what he owes to the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="365">
BUT this is not all: but when the A&s;&s;embly is thus purg'd by the Ju&s;tice of this Gho&s;t in an I|mage, it is then taken up and plac'd upon the Shoulders of a blind Monk, who carries it out of the Church into the Town; the Monk being blind and not knowing whither he goes, is guided by the occult impre&s;&s;ion of the Image, who guides him as a Rider guides a blind Hor&s;e; and thus he carries him directly to the Hou&s;e of &s;uch as are Delinquent in the ca&s;e of Debt to the Altar of St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is it enough that the Debtor &s;eeing the Apparition or Image coming to him, flies from it, and e&s;capes from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; for the Image cau&s;es the Monk to follow him by the Foot, as a Hound does a Hare; &s;o that, in a word, there's no e&s;caping St. <HI>George,</HI> no flying from him, the Monk is &s;teddy in his pur&s;uit, a&s;cends, de&s;cends, pa&s;&s;es, repa&s;&s;es, enters all places, 'till the poor Wretch, who may be truly &s;aid to be hunted down, or Hounded down as they expre&s;s it in the North, is oblig'd to pay the utmo&s;t Farthing.</P>
<P>THIS Story fully confirm'd my thoughts in a Remark which I made from the beginning of this Work, that really Church Apparitions are the mo&s;t frightful, mo&s;t teizing, and terrible in their way, of all the real <HI>Devils</HI> that walk about in the World.</P>
<P>BUT what need we wander thus among the Ancients, and hunt among the <HI>Greek</HI> Schi&s;maticks for artificial Apparitions, and for Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Delu|&s;ions of this kind? The <HI>Roman</HI> Church, that true Catholick E&s;tabli&s;hment, built upon the &s;olid Rock of St. <HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf, how full is it of glorious Frauds of this kind? and how has the whole Scheme of Papal Tyranny been &s;upported among the People in this very manner, ever &s;ince the great defection of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hierarchy, from its true Primitive Pu|rity, and original holy In&s;titution?</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="366">

<P>BUT to come to the Ca&s;e in hand, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Apparition I meet with de&s;erves our par|ticular Remark; fir&s;t indeed, becau&s;e of the Impor|tance of the Occa&s;ion, namely, for the Confirma|tion of the Faith of all true Catholicks in that great di&s;puted, yet un&s;ettled Point, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>ever St.</HI> PETER <HI>was at</HI> ROME <HI>or no?</HI> a Point &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial, and which the Hereticks take &s;o much Pains to make doubtful, that if we Catholicks do not e&s;tabli&s;h it pa&s;t all the Cavils of our Enemies, we do nothing; and for this we bring the miraculous Apparition of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to St. <HI>Peter</HI> ju&s;t without the City, and which carried <HI>Peter</HI> back again into the City; &s;o that as he came out of <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and return'd

<P>THIS being of &s;o great Importance to the Ca|tholick Church, it is meet I &s;hould bring you good Authority for the Relation; and therefore thinking my &s;elf not competent, not a &s;ufficient Evidence, being perhaps &s;u&s;pected of Here&s;y, I &s;hall give it you out of the Labours of an ancient Father of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and you &s;hall have the Story from his own Mouth, and in his own Words, as follows: It is the famous Doctor <HI>Smith,</HI> a Popi&s;h Preacher in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, who boa&s;ted that he had overcome both Bi&s;hop <HI>Ridley,</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Latimer,</HI> in a Di&s;pute again&s;t them about St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s having been at <HI>Rome.</HI> Take a piece of the Reverend Doctor's Sermon.</P>
<P>THE Doctor's Bu&s;ine&s;s was to take upon him to run down the poor oppre&s;s'd Confe&s;&s;ors, <HI>Cranmer, Ridley</HI> and <HI>Latimer,</HI> and make them odious to the People; and being to preach a Sermon upon this Subject at <HI>Whitti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gton</HI> College in <HI>London,</HI> (the &s;ame, or near it, that is now call'd St. <HI>Martin Vintry)</HI> He begins thus,</P>

<P>HERE'S an Apparition of good Fame, and of extraordinary Authority; and if any Objection can lye again&s;t it, 'tis only whether it be true or not; but I am not to an&s;wer for that, 'tis certainly true, that the Learned Doctor preach'd this excel|lent Sermon, and that's enough for me.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="369">
BUT having thus given you an Apparition of &s;uch great Authority, namely of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, I &s;hall quote you a few others of a more mo|dern kind to confirm you in this Principle, namely, that Apparitions did not cea&s;e in the Church: Tho' Miracles are &s;aid to cea&s;e, and Prophe&s;ies cea&s;e, tho' Oracles are dumb, and the Dead do not return; yet that Apparition is not wanting, and the Artifices of the Fathers remain; namely, that they can &s;how you wonders in Vi&s;ion every Day for the Confir|mation of that great Catholick Verity.</P>
<P>I MIGHT de&s;cend here to the famous Appariti|on of <HI>Loudon,</HI> commonly call'd the <HI>Devil</HI> of <HI>Lou|don;</HI> and the yet more famous Apparition of <HI>Jetzer</HI> at <HI>Bern</HI> in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The&s;e are indeed Orthodox Delu&s;ions, and both carried on with the utmo&s;t A&s;&s;urance, I had almo&s;t &s;aid Villany, by the Prie&s;ts: But I am not come &s;o far down yet on our way to Modern Roguery.</P>
<P>ONE of our Popes I think in&s;i&s;ted, that he had had an Apparition of the <HI>Devil</HI> to him; whereas St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> each in their turn put the Bite of Apparition upon the World, in &s;o many particular ca&s;es, that if they had not, as we may &s;ay, left it off in time, as the World took them for mad Men and Fools, they would have taken them for what they really were, <HI>viz.</HI> Knaves and Cheats, and have u&s;ed them accordingly; and indeed it was once within an Ace with St. <HI>Francis</HI> of his being whipt through the Streets at <HI>Naples</HI> for an Impo&s;tor; and he had but one way to get off, which was to add &s;ome things to his Conduct &s;o extremely &s;illy and ridiculous, that he was taken for an Idiot, and let run loo&s;e in the Streets with a crowd of Boys at his Heels following and &s;houting at him, and throwing Dirt and rotten Eggs upon him. This he turn'd into a &s;pecies of Martyrdom, valued him&s;elf upon it, and would not &s;uffer the Filth to

be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">raped off from him; becau&s;e it was the Orna|ment and Crown of his Sufferings for preaching the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IT was doubtful, for &s;ome time, whether this holy Enthu&s;ia&s;t had more Apparitions of the <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin,</HI> or of the <HI>Devil,</HI> following him: It is true, &s;ome of our Hereticks affirm'd he had no Apparitions at all, either of the <HI>Virgin</HI> or of the <HI>Devil;</HI> but that it was all a <HI>devili&s;h</HI> Cheat, which he had the Face to put upon the World. But this, they tell us, is too uncharitable; becau&s;e 'tis &s;uppo&s;ing the Wretch him&s;elf, (who, it is allow'd, was a very weak and &s;illy, tho' an impudent Fellow) was able to Impo&s;e upon all the World at that time, who Univer&s;ally believ'd that he had &s;een &s;ome Apparitions which elevated his Mind to that degree of Euthu&s;ia&s;m which he appear'd acted by.</P>
<P>BUT then, if we mu&s;t allow he was vi&s;ited with Apparitions, it mu&s;t be of the <HI>Devil,</HI> not the <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin;</HI> becau&s;e we have no Scripture Autho|rity to &s;upport the Notion that &s;he ever did, or can appear at all, either to him or any body el&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and that all the pretended Apparitions of the Vir|gin <HI>Mary,</HI> of what kind &s;oever, which the Le|gends are full of, are the meer Impo&s;tures of the Prie&s;ts, as really and openly as if they had been &s;een to be perform'd: Such was her &s;peaking to St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> when he came up the Nave of the great Church at <HI>Millan,</HI> at four &s;teps, twen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y Yards at a &s;tep; at the fir&s;t &s;tep he &s;aid <HI>O Faelix!</HI> at the &s;econd &s;tep, <HI>O Pia!</HI> at the third &s;tep, <HI>O Santa!</HI> and at the fourth &s;tep, <HI>Maria!</HI> to which the Image an&s;wer'd, <HI>Salve Bernardi.</HI> The Marks of the four &s;teps, Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his Letters, tells us are to be &s;een in the Church &s;till, cover'd with little Plates of Bra&s;s, having the Words &s;everally cut upon them: and yet in &s;pite of the Relique we cannot

for our Lives believe that the &s;ilent Image &s;poke to him, any more than that he &s;tept twenty Yards at a &s;tride.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we are at a Point with St. <HI>Francis,</HI> that if any Apparition did haunt him, it was that of the <HI>Devil;</HI> and they tell us this was &s;o frequent, that at la&s;t he pray'd to the <HI>Virgin,</HI> that the <HI>Devil</HI> might not be allow'd to appear to him but upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions; and that whenever he did, he &s;hould have the better of the <HI>Devil,</HI> if he contended with him: after which the <HI>Devil</HI> never appear'd to him at all in his own Shape, as it &s;eems he u&s;ed to do, but always un|der &s;ome Di&s;gui&s;e, or in other Per&s;ons Shapes, tempting him in tho&s;e Apparitions, as he found Occa&s;ion; but that he was always too hard for him, and drove him away. Who had the Victory at la&s;t, Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent: but &s;ome are apt to doubt that the <HI>Devil</HI> had the better of him then, for that we do not read much of his Triumph over the <HI>Devil,</HI> in <HI>Articulo Mortis.</HI></P>

<P>UPON a Day, &s;ays the Story, when he lea&s;t thought of it, behold <HI>Ignatius</HI> comes up into his Cell, or Chamber, and having talk'd with him a very con&s;iderable while, &s;uddenly di&s;appear'd; lea|ving the Je&s;uit exceedingly comforted with &s;uch a prodigious wonderful Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>FRANCIS</HI> did the&s;e things frequently, it &s;eems, and rid thro' the Air in a fiery Chariot; which I dare &s;ay is as true as that St. <HI>Dun&s;tan,</HI> while he was a Boy, flew down from the top of <HI>Gla&s;tenbury Tor,</HI> or <HI>Tower,</HI> a Place well known in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THE Conver&s;ion of St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> they tell us, was brought to pa&s;s by an Apparition of St. <HI>Peter</HI> to him, who came and touch'd his Wounds re|ceiv'd in Battle, and healed them immediately; and yet it &s;eems as if St. <HI>Peter</HI> was but a lame Doctor, for that St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> halted, and that his Leg was crooked as long as he liv'd, cannot be deny'd; whereas when St. <HI>Peter</HI> healed the impotent Man at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Text &s;ays he made him <HI>every whit whole, Acts</HI> iii. 7, 8.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="374">
ST. <HI>FRANCIS</HI> is &s;aid to have done innume|rable Cures for &s;ick and di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons, by ap|pearing to them after his Death, and I could fill a Volume with the Hi&s;tory of them; but it &s;eems to be needle&s;s, all true Catholicks acknowledge it.</P>
<P><HI>PASCALL, Ignatius</HI>'s Chamber-Fellow and Companion, being reduced to great Nece&s;&s;ities af|ter his Death, implores the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Col|legue in the Church of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> or &s;ome other Church at <HI>Rome;</HI> immediately he heard a melodious Sound, and &s;aw <HI>Ignatius</HI> appearing to him, attended with a numerous and beautiful Train of the Servants of God; but what Relief the Ap|parition gave him in his extream Nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>this Deponent &s;aith not.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I may clo&s;e the Di&s;cour&s;e of impos'd Ap|paritions with that memorable Story of <HI>Jetzer,</HI> a <HI>Dominican</HI> in the Mona&s;try or Hou&s;e of <HI>Domini|cans</HI> at <HI>Bern,</HI> in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland:</HI> The Forgery is ma|nife&s;t, and the Rea&s;on of it; 'twas an Impo&s;ition upon the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> and contriv'd to carry on the Contention which was between the two Societies to a compleat Victory.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI>'s being Immaculate, and born without original Sin, &s;anctify'd from the Womb; and therefore they can|nonize Ble&s;&s;ed St. <HI>Ann,</HI> who was the <HI>Virgin</HI>'s Mo|ther, and make her a triumphant Saint; almo&s;t as glorious as her Daughter, and have a Service for her, call'd, <HI>the Prerogatives of St.</HI> Ann, <HI>Mother of the Mother of God:</HI> wherein they declare &s;he con|ceiv'd the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI> without the Knowledge of a Man, and that it was upon an Apparition of two Angels to her, which &s;he relates to her Hu&s;|band <HI>Joachim.</HI> There's an Apparition too for the Confirmation of the <HI>Franci&s;cans.</HI> (That's by the way.)</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="375">
THE <HI>Dominicans,</HI> on the other hand, deny that the <HI>Virgin</HI> is Immaculate; they allow that &s;he is conceiv'd in Sin, but that &s;he continu'd un|der the <HI>Culpa</HI> or <HI>Defilement</HI> but three Days; and they bring in an Apparition of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI> to this Friar <HI>Jetzer,</HI> lamenting to him that they &s;hould go about to make her equal to her Son in Holine&s;s, and confe&s;&s;ing, in the Words of the Text, that &s;he was <HI>&s;hapen in Iniquity, P&s;al.</HI> li. 5.</P>
<P>SO here is one Miracle to confute another, and perhaps both alike authentick.</P>
<P>BUT the Story of <HI>Jetzer</HI> is full of Miracles, all contriv'd by the Prior, and three of the Fa|thers: fir&s;t, the Apparition of a Soul in Purgatory comes to <HI>Jetzer</HI> with a Box near his Mouth, &s;o con|triv'd, that when he breath'd upon it, it appear'd to be all Fire coming out of his Mouth; he had al&s;o three Dogs hanging upon him, and gnawing him as his Tormentors.</P>
<P>IN this Po&s;ture he comes to the poor Friar <HI>Jet|zer</HI> in the dark, and when he was in his Bed, tells him his deplorable Condition, but that he might be taken out of Purgatory by his Means, and by his Mortifications; and this Story he backs with mo&s;t horrible Groans, as in the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery by his Sufferings.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> You are to under&s;tand that this Friar <HI>Jet|zer</HI> was a Fellow pick'd out to make a proper Tool for the&s;e Impo&s;tures, being very &s;illy, and very devout; and had they not over-acted the thing, the De&s;ign might have gone a great way.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of the fir&s;t Apparition, they made the poor Friar undergo &s;evere Di&s;cipline, Whipping and Mortifications, and then the Appa|rition came and thank'd him, and told him he was deliver'd out of Purgatory by his Means; &s;o that
<PB N="359" REF="376">
Part ended, to the infinite Satisfaction of the poor macerated Friar.</P>
<P>THE next was the Apparition of the &s;ame Per|&s;on, but in the Habit of a <HI>Nun,</HI> repre&s;enting St. <HI>Bar|bara,</HI> and all in Glory; telling him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">at the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin was &s;o delighted with his Zeal and Devotion, that &s;he would vi&s;it him the next Day in Per&s;on, and give him her Benediction for Con|&s;olation in his Sufferings and Mortifications; at which the Fool (the Friar I mean) was ravi&s;hed with Joy, and prepar'd him&s;elf and the whole Conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to receive her.</P>
<P>AT the appointed time, the expected Delu&s;ion appeared: The ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, clothed with the utmo&s;t Magnificence, dre&s;s'd up with Jewels, as &s;he u&s;ed to be on Occa&s;ion of the mo&s;t &s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mn Fe&s;ti|vals; attended by Angels which were &s;een to be flying about her, as her Pages.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> They were the little carv'd Angels which were placed in the Church upon extraordinary Days, and now placed as Machines about the Apparition, and lifted up in the Air, with Pul|lies fa&s;ten'd in the Room above.</P>
<P>IN this Equipage, the Lady Queen of Heaven, Mother of God, was brought in Apparition to her poor mortify'd and humble Servant; &s;he care&s;t him with high Expre&s;&s;ions of Affection to him, extol|ling the Merit of his Charity, in &s;uffering &s;uch S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|verities for the meer Love of delivering a poor tormented Soul out of Purgatory; own'd to him, that &s;he was conceived in original Sin; and told him Pope <HI>Julius,</HI> who then held the Chair, &s;hould put a final End to all tho&s;e Di&s;putes, and &s;hould aboli&s;h the Fea&s;t of her Conception. After much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &s;he promi&s;ed him a Mi&s;&s;ion to go to the holy Father in her Name, to a&s;&s;ure him of the Truth of the Vi&s;ion, and that it was her Plea&s;ure it &s;hould be &s;o; and in Confirmation of it
<PB N="360" REF="377">
all, &s;he gave him three Drops of Blood, which &s;he told him were the Tears Chri&s;t &s;hed, when he wept over <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> with abundance of &s;uch like.</P>
<P>HERE was a true &s;ham Apparition now, form'd to e&s;tabli&s;h a particular Sect or Society; and a parti|cular Profe&s;&s;ion, concerning the immaculate Concep|tion; here could the impatient Friars have &s;et Bounds to their Revenge, they had had a compleat Victory over the <HI>Franci&s;cans.</HI> Nay, had St. <HI>Francis</HI> him&s;elf come up in Apparition on the other &s;ide, it would not have balanc'd the Cheat; for all the World began to give Credit to the Apparition.</P>
<P>BUT the Prie&s;ts knew no Bounds; nothing would &s;erve them but new Apparitions to the Friar, and new Mortifications to the <HI>Franci&s;cans;</HI> 'till in &s;hort <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tzer</HI> him&s;elf, as fooli&s;h and &s;imple as he was, &s;aw through it, detected the Cheat, and e&s;caping out of the Mona&s;tery, di&s;cover'd it all to the Magi|&s;trates, having twice e&s;caped being poi&s;on'd by them; &s;o the whole Fraud ended at the Gallows, or rather at the Stake, for the four Friars were condemned to be burnt, and were executed accor|dingly.</P>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;covery is not to my Purpo&s;e, it may be &s;een in many Authors, as al&s;o the Tryal, Sentence, and Execution of the Crimi|nals at <HI>Bern, May</HI> 31, 1509, where they were all burnt together. But this Part is effectually to my Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that there has been, and I doubt not &s;till is, a great deal of &s;ham Apparition impos'd upon the World by the Delu&s;ions of others; and as it lies chiefly among the Clergy, where mu&s;t we look for it, but where it is to be found?</P>
<P>NOR are the Pagan Clergy free from the &s;ame vile Practices, namely, to forge Apparitions to con|firm their Delu&s;ions; and the Hi&s;tory of all Coun|tries are full of Accounts of it, too many to repeat here.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="378">
THE Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Exorci&s;ms in the di&s;mal Story of the <HI>Devils</HI> of <HI>Loudon,</HI> are full of Appari|tions and Vi&s;ions, by which the wretched Fraud was carried on, and by which &s;o much Villany was practis'd, as is almo&s;t without Example; a Story which has already fill'd a Book, and is extant in many Languages; a Fraud not out-done by the Brachmans and Prie&s;ts of the <HI>Pagans</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> or in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>I MIGHT next entertain you with &s;ham Appa|ritions put in Practice by the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, in tho&s;e Countries where he has made him&s;elf be wor&s;hip|ped as a God, and where he &s;upports all the Devil|wor&s;hip by Apparition; &s;howing him&s;elf now one way, now another, as he finds it for his Purpo&s;e; appearing one Day in Fire and Flame, at another time in Storm and Tempe&s;t, at a third time in Humane and Familiar Shape; and in all the End is to keep up the Dread of his Per&s;on in the Minds of his Wor&s;hip|pers, and to pre&s;erve a Reverence to his In&s;titutions, whatever they are.</P>
<P>IF we may believe our Writers of Travels, and Ob&s;ervers of Things, the <HI>Devil</HI> not only a&s;&s;umes Humane Shape, but in&s;inuates him&s;elf in the real Per&s;on of a <HI>Devil</HI> to the Women, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, (to &s;ay no more of it) as to commit horrid namele&s;s Wickedne&s;&s;es with them, &s;uch as are not to be &s;ugge&s;ted without Horror. In other Places, the Apparition of the <HI>Devil</HI> is the Fund of all their religious Wor&s;hip, and he has Altars ere|cted, and Sacrifices, nay, which is wor&s;e, Human Sacrifices offered to him.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e horrid Performances, he appears in ter|rible Shapes, and the poor Natives are &s;o frighted at him, that the Fear only excites the Homage which they pay to him, and &s;ecures to him an en|tire Sovereignty: for Fear, may, for ought I know, be the Characteri&s;tick of a Pagan Wor&s;hip, as Love is that of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="379">
THE Great Temple of <HI>Montezuma</HI> at <HI>Mexico</HI> was little el&s;e but a horrible Butchery of Humane Carca&s;&s;es, the Blood of which lay &s;prinkled or da&s;h'd again&s;t the Walls, 'till it lay there har|dened and congeal'd, if Report may be believ'd, a|bove a Foot thick, and that they &s;acrifiz'd at lea&s;t twentythou&s;and People a Year, in that one Pagode or Temple.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Indians</HI> confe&s;s'd, that they had frequent Apparitions among them of the Spiritis, which they called by &s;everal Names; and that the Great Spirit, that is the <HI>Devil,</HI> al&s;o appeared to them up|on their Great Fe&s;tivals, in bright and extraordi|nary Apparition; to approve and accept of their Wor&s;hip and Homage, and no doubt of their Sa|crifices too.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Cochin China</HI> we are told the <HI>Devil</HI> goes far|ther; for he not only &s;hows him&s;elf in Apparition, but he utters lying Oracles, even him&s;elf in his pro|per Per&s;on, and al&s;o whi&s;pers &s;uch An&s;wers to the Prie&s;ts, as &s;erve to keep up a Decorum in their Wor&s;hip, and a &s;ecret Reverence to his Per&s;on. And Father <HI>Borri</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Devil</HI> walks about there &s;o frequently, and &s;o familiarly in Humane Shapes, that they are not at all di&s;turb'd at him.</P>
<P>AT other times, as the &s;ame Author affirms, they a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with particular Per&s;ons, upon various Occa&s;ions, and e&s;pecially with the Women, as abov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; &s;o that, in &s;hort, in &s;ome Cities, which are very populous, it would be &s;omething hard to di&s;tingui&s;h between the real People and the Ap|paritions. How far, if it were examin'd into, it would not be the like among us, I won't pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>WHO knows, in our Throngs of divided Chri|&s;tians, whether he meets with a Saint or an Appa|rition; whether he talks with a Coun&s;ellor or a <HI>Devil?</HI> and the art of di&s;cerning would indeed be well
<PB N="363" REF="380">
worth having; indeed, it would be worth buying, if Money would purcha&s;e it. The <HI>Devil</HI>'s Di&s;gui&s;es are very many, and Apparition is one of the be&s;t of them, becau&s;e he can &s;oon change Shapes, and change Po&s;tures, which in other Ca&s;es he may find le&s;s advantageous to his Intere&s;t. Nor is it ea&s;y for Mankind to come to the Certainty, even when he &s;ees an Apparition, whether it be a Good or an Evil Appearance; and the be&s;t way of finding it out, except that of judging by the Errand he comes on, and which I have mention'd already, is to ask it the Que&s;tion directly; if it equivocates and &s;huffles, conclude 'tis the <HI>Devil;</HI> for he is a Sharper, and a Di&s;&s;embler from the Beginning: if 'tis a good Spirit, it will an&s;wer you directly and hone&s;tly, and tell you its Bu&s;ine&s;s at once; and this is what I mean, where I &s;ay, SPEAK TO IT.</P>
<P>IF you find it is a good Spirit hearken to it; if the <HI>Devil,</HI> defie it; and whether it be a good or evil Spirit, <HI>fear it not;</HI> for both are under the &s;pe|cial Direction and Authority of him that made the World, and will govern it, in who&s;e Hands you are; and 'tis well it is &s;o; For as Good is above Evil, &s;o God is above the Devil. Tell him &s;o, and bid him Defiance, and if you can but do it with a good Heart he's gone; depend upon it, he'll never &s;tand you, <HI>Probatum e&s;t.</HI> But I mu&s;t leave off the religious Cheats, for they are endle&s;s; 'tis time to talk of Apparitions of another nature, le&s;s &s;erious, and le&s;s tire&s;ome to hear of.</P>

<P>AS the <HI>Devil</HI> is not &s;o Black as he is Painted, &s;o neither does he appear in &s;o many Shapes as we make for him; we Dre&s;s him up in more Suits of Cloaths, and more Ma&s;querade Habits, than ever he wore; and I que&s;tion much, if he was to &s;ee the Pictures and Figures which we call <HI>Devil,</HI> whether he would know him&s;elf by &s;ome of them or no.</P>
<P>IT would require more Skill than, I doubt, I am Ma&s;ter of, to bring you all to a right Method of thinking upon this Subject; however I &s;hall venture upon it by way of E&s;&s;ay, that you may form &s;uch Images of the <HI>old Gentleman</HI> in your Mind, that you may not be cheated about him, may know him when you &s;ee him, may not call him out of his Name, or be&s;tow his Right Wor|&s;hipful Titles upon another.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that tho' mo&s;t People in all Parts of the World allow there is &s;uch a thing as a <HI>Devil,</HI> an evil Spirit, an Arch-Enemy of Mankind; and they are pretty near one another in their &s;eve|ral Notions of him; for even tho&s;e Savages that wor&s;hip him, acknowledge they do &s;o only that he may not hurt them; yet they differ exceedingly in their Ideas of his Per&s;on, and that almo&s;t every where; and accordingly it follows that they mu&s;t differ in their Repre&s;entations and Pictures of him.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="382">
SOME Paint him one way, &s;ome another; and yet I ob&s;erve that &s;o little good Will they have for him any where, that they all Picture him as ugly, as mon&s;trous, and as deform'd as they can.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard of &s;ome Pagans who wor&s;hip a black Cloud for the <HI>Devil,</HI> becau&s;e it often &s;peaks in Noi&s;es, and breathes out Fire. I cannot &s;ay but wor&s;hipping the Sun for a <HI>God,</HI> and the Thunder and Lightening for a <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;eems to me to have more Sen&s;e in it than many of the other Branches of Idolatry in the World; the one being the mo&s;t natural re&s;emblance of the greate&s;t Good, and the other of the greate&s;t Evil in the World.</P>
<P>SOME, I am told, re&s;emble or repre&s;ent the <HI>Devil</HI> by a va&s;t great Globe of Wood carv'd or cut all over into Mouths, de&s;crib'd in a thou|&s;and different Di&s;tortions, gaping, grining, and vo|racious Figures; all intimating a greedy unquench|able Thir&s;t or Appetite to devour and de&s;troy; rolling it&s;elf continually about, &s;o that &s;ome of its thou&s;and of Mouths being undermo&s;t, are always gaping and biting, and taking in &s;omething, but ever un&s;atisfy'd, the re&s;t of 'em gaping &s;till for more. If this hideous Repre&s;entation is not ju&s;t to his Form, I think verily it is ju&s;t to his Nature, and is very Emblematick: the Thoughts it gives Birth to in our Fancy, may not be &s;o remote as are form'd by tho&s;e &s;imple, Comick, and yet wou'd-be|frightful Draughts we draw of him; with a Cock's Bill, A&s;s's Ears, Goat's Horns, glaring Eyes, Batts Wings, cloven Foot, and Dragon's Tail; not one of which, except the la&s;t, having either Antiquity or Authority for them, that I know of.</P>
<P>IT'S true, he is de&s;crib'd in the <HI>Apoc a lyp&s;e</HI> as a great red Dragon, and in another Place as a Bea&s;t, but neither of them give us any true Idea of his real Form.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="383">
NOW if we do not know his Figure, how &s;hall we know him in Apparition? for if we know no|thing of his real Shape, how &s;hall we judge of him in his Di&s;gui&s;e? How &s;hall we &s;ingle him out up|on Occa&s;ion? Suppo&s;e we were to look for him at a Ma&s;querade; For my Part I cannot deny but I might mi&s;take him, and pitch upon a Prie&s;t, or a Turk, a Tinker or a Tarpaulin, and &s;ay this is the <HI>Devil,</HI> or that is the <HI>Devil,</HI> as &s;oon as the real <HI>Hydra-pater</HI> him&s;elf, and let him pa&s;s perhaps for a <HI>No-body</HI> worth taking Notice of.</P>
<P>AS then, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> we have &s;uch unguided Notions of him, and know him &s;o little in any of his un|couth Figures and Di&s;gui&s;es, 'tis not &s;o much won|der that we mi&s;take every ugly mi&s;-&s;hapen mon|&s;trous Thing, and call it by his venerable Name.</P>

in his Mind than a real Deficiency of Brains, had, by a long Di&s;u&s;e of the &s;prightly Part of his Sen&s;e, which he really had no want of at other times, &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to &s;ink a little too low in his Spirits, and let the <HI>Hypochondria</HI> emit too &s;trong|ly in Vapour and Fumes up into his Head. This had its Fits and its Intervals; &s;ometimes he was clear|&s;ighted, and clear-headed, but at other times he &s;aw Stars at Noon-day, and <HI>Devils</HI> at Night: In a word, the World was an Apparition to his Ima|gination, when the <HI>Flatus</HI> prevail'd, and the Spleen boil'd up; of all which he could give no account, nor could he a&s;&s;i&s;t the Operation of Phy&s;ick by any of his own Powers towards a Cure.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that he was abroad at a Friend's Hou&s;e later than ordinary one Night, but being Moon-light, and a Servant with him, he was ea&s;y, and was ob&s;erved to be very chearful, and even <HI>Merry,</HI> with a great deal of good Humour, more than had been ob&s;erved of him for a great while be|fore.</P>
<P>HE knew his Way perfectly well, for it was within three Miles of the Town where he liv'd, and he was very well mounted; but tho' the Moon was up, an Accident which a little di&s;order'd him was, that it was not only cloudy, but a very thick, black Cloud came &s;uddenly, (that is to &s;ay, without his Notice, &s;o it was &s;uddenly to him) and &s;pread over his Head, which made it very dark; and to add to the Di&s;order, it began to rain violently.</P>
<P>UPON this, being very well mounted, as I have &s;aid, he re&s;olved to ride for it, having not above two Miles to the Town; &s;o clapping Spurs to his Hor&s;e, he gallop'd away. His Man, who&s;e Name was <HI>Gervais,</HI> not being &s;o well mounted, was a good way behind. The Darkne&s;s and the Rain together put him a little out of Humour; but as that
<PB REF="388">

<PB N="371" REF="389">
was a little unexpected perhaps it made him ride the harder, rather than abated his Pace.</P>
<P>IN the Way there was a &s;mall River, but there was a good Bridge over it, well walled on both &s;ides; &s;o that there was no Danger there, more than any where el&s;e: But the Gentleman kept on his &s;peed to go over the Bridge, when being rather more than half over, his Hor&s;e &s;topt on a &s;udden, and re|fu&s;ed, as we call it, bearing off to the right hand; he &s;aw nothing at fir&s;t, and was not much di&s;compos'd at it, but &s;purr'd his Hor&s;e to go forward; the Hor&s;e went two or three Steps, then &s;topt again, &s;norted, and &s;tared, and then offer'd to turn &s;hort back; then the Gentleman looking forward to &s;ee what was the matter, and if he could ob&s;erve what the Hor&s;e was &s;cared at, &s;aw two broad &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ring Eyes, which, as he &s;aid, look'd him full in the Face.</P>
<P>THEN he was heartily frighted indeed; but by this time he heard his Man <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rvais</HI> coming up. When <HI>Gervais</HI> came near, the fir&s;t thing he heard his Ma&s;ter &s;ay, was&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;s me, it is the Devil!</HI> at which <HI>Gervais,</HI> a low-&s;pirited Fellow, was as much frighted as his Ma&s;ter. However, his Ma&s;ter, a little encou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aged to hear his Man &s;o near him, pre&s;s'd his Hor&s;e once more, and call'd aloud to <HI>Ger|vais</HI> to come; but he, as I &s;aid, being frighted too, made no ha&s;te: at length with much ado his Ma&s;ter, &s;purring his Hor&s;e again, got over the Bridge, and pa&s;&s;ed by the Creature with broad Eyes, which (the Light a little encrea&s;ing) he affirm'd po&s;itively, when he was pa&s;s'd, was a great black BEAR, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t be the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>THO' <HI>Gervais</HI> was near enough, yet fearing his Ma&s;ter would &s;et him to go before, he kept as far off as he could: When his Ma&s;ter call'd he an|&s;wer'd indeed, but did not come on, at lea&s;t did not make much ha&s;te; but &s;eeing his Ma&s;ter was gone pa&s;t, and that he him&s;elf was then obliged to follow,
<PB N="372" REF="390">
he went on &s;oftly, and when he came to the Bridge, he &s;aw what it was his Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;e &s;norted at, and refu&s;ed to go on; of which you &s;hall hear more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>HIS Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;e being got pa&s;t the Difficul|ty, needed no Spurs, but (as frighted Hor&s;es will) flew away like the Wind; and the Rain continu|ing, his Ma&s;ter, who on many Accounts was wil|ling to be at home, let him go; &s;o that he was at home and got into the Hou&s;e, long before his Man <HI>Jervais</HI> could get up with him.</P>
<P>THE Ma&s;ter, as &s;oon as he came into the Light, &s;woon'd away, and the Fright had had &s;uch an ef|fect upon him, that when with much Difficulty they had brought him to him&s;elf, he continued very ill; and when his Lady, and a Si&s;ter he had in the Hou&s;e with him, as much over-run with the <HI>Hyppo</HI> as him&s;elf, came to enquire what had happened to him, he told them a formal Story, that at &s;uch a Bridge he met the <HI>Devil;</HI> that he placed him&s;elf ju&s;t at the coming off from the Bridge, on his left hand, at the Corner of the Wall; that he &s;tood and &s;tared in his Face, and that he could di|&s;tinctly perceive it was the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Shape of a <HI>Bear:</HI> He gave other De&s;criptions, &s;o punctual and particular, that there was no room to doubt but it was an Apparition, and that it was in the Shape of a great Bear.</P>
<P><HI>GERVAIS</HI> came home &s;oon after, and going in|to the Stable directly, as was his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to take care of his Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;e as well as his own, there he told the Story his Way, among the other Servants, and e&s;pecially two or three Grooms, and Servants belong|ing to Gentlemen that were Neighbours; and he tells them, that his Ma&s;ter was in great danger of being thrown over the Wall of the Bridge, for that his Hor&s;e was frighted at an A&s;s which &s;tood ju&s;t at the Corner of the Wall; and it was my
<PB N="373" REF="391">
Fault indeed, &s;ays <HI>Gervais,</HI> for it was a young Hor&s;e, and I had never told my Ma&s;ter; but it was a Trick he had got that he could not abide an A&s;s, and would by no means come near one if he could help it.</P>
<P>AND are you &s;ure 'twas an A&s;s, <HI>Gervais?</HI> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ys the other Servants, &s;taring at one another as if they were frighted: Are you &s;ure of it?

<P>WHY <HI>Gervais,</HI> &s;ays they, your Ma&s;ter believes it was the <HI>Devil,</HI> as really as if he had &s;poken to it.</P>
<P>I'M &s;orry my Ma&s;ter &s;hould be &s;o frighted, &s;ays <HI>Jervais;</HI> but I am very &s;ure it was nothing but an <HI>A&s;s.</HI> But the Story had gotten Vent, and the fir&s;t Part of it flew all over the Town that Mr.&mdash;had &s;een the <HI>Devil,</HI> and was almo&s;t frighted to Death.</P>
<P>THEN came his Man <HI>Jarvis</HI>'s Tale, and made it appear that Mr.&mdash;'s &s;trange and wonderful Apparition was dwindled into an A&s;s, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> he had &s;een in the Shape of a Bear was no more than a poor <HI>Boricco,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> call him; this made his Ma&s;ter be laught at &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, poor <HI>Jarvis</HI> or <HI>Gervais</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ain to turn out, and lo&s;t his Place for it; and the wi&s;e Mr.&mdash;to this Day in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that 'twas the <HI>Devil,</HI> and he knew him by his broad Eyes; tho' 'tis known that a Bear has very little Eyes: but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;wade any Vapouri&s;h Body, that they have not &s;een the <HI>Devil,</HI> if they have but &s;een &s;omething, and that they are very &s;ure, they are not &s;ure what it is.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a Delu&s;ion almo&s;t as gro&s;s, the Memory of which I believe remains for a Truth to this day. Not far off of the Town of <HI>Darking</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> the People, or &s;ome People rather, entertained
<PB N="374" REF="392">
a Notion, from the following Pa&s;&s;age, that a Gho&s;t walk'd in &s;uch a Place; that &s;he (for it was an antient Lady lately dead) was &s;een hovering about the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e which was left uninha|bited for &s;ome time, that &s;he would be up and down in the Hou&s;e very often, in the Day-time, making a rumbling, and a clattering Noi&s;e; and in the Night-time &s;he walk'd in the neighbouring Fields with a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ndle in her Hand, and that tho' the Wind blew ever &s;o hard, it would not blow the Candle out; that &s;ometimes &s;he would appear in the open Field, &s;ometimes up in the Trees, and particularly there was a little Heath near <HI>Darking</HI> called the <HI>Cottman D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an,</HI> where it was &s;aid &s;he was frequently &s;een.</P>
<P>THERE was a Boarding-&s;chool of Boys in that Town, where there was in particular &s;ome rogui&s;h <HI>London</HI> Boys, who contrived all this Walking from the Beginning to the End; Fir&s;t, they got a &s;mall Rope, and tying one end of it to an old Chair which &s;tood in an upper Room of the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e, (for they had found means to get in and out of the Hou&s;e at plea&s;ure) they brought the other end of the Rope down on the Out-&s;ide of the Hou&s;e in a private Place where it could not ea&s;ily be &s;een, and by this they pulled the old Chair up, and then let it fall down again, and made a great Noi&s;e in the Hou&s;e, &s;o as it might be ea&s;ily heard by the Neigh|bours; then other Boys of the &s;ame Gang took care to call out to the old Women in the next Hou&s;es, that now they might hear the old Lady a playing her Pranks; and accordingly they would all a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;emble in the Court-yard, where they could plainly hear it, but not one would venture to go up Stairs. If any offered to go up a little way, then all was quiet again; but as &s;oon as ever they retired, the rumbling would begin again: This was for the Day.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="393">
IN the Night, one of the&s;e unlucky Boys had gotten a dark Lanthorn, which was a thing the Country People did not under&s;tand, and with this he walk'd all about the Orchard, and two or three Clo&s;es near the Hou&s;e, &s;ometimes &s;hewing the Light on this &s;ide, and then his Comrades calling all the old Women about 'em to &s;ee it, on a &s;udden the Light would go out, the Boy clo&s;ing up the Lan|thorn; and then he would run &s;wiftly cro&s;s the whole Field, and &s;hew his Light again on the other &s;ide. Now he would be up in a Tree, then in the Road, then upon the middle of the Heath; &s;o that the Country People made no more Que&s;tion, but that the old Lady walk'd with a Candle in her Hand, than that they &s;aw the Light of it; and in a word, it pa&s;s'd for an Apparition as certainly as we on the other hand knew what Knavery agitated it all.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s'd that a dark Lanthorn, join'd with an Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Head, might prevail to make &s;uch a Sham take, with weak and bigotted Peo|ple, and they were mighty willing to &s;ay before|hand that they were &s;ure &s;omething walk'd.</P>
<P>WHEN they heard the Chair tumble about in the Chamber, tho' pulled by a String and no body near it, no nor in the whole Hou&s;e, the People who came together in the Court-yard, fancy'd often the &s;aw Heads of People moving up and down the Room where the Noi&s;e was, and one &s;aid po&s;itively &s;he &s;aw a white Head-dre&s;s.</P>

<PB N="376" REF="394">
was nothing but the mean Contrivance of a few Boys.</P>
<P>THE Notion of Spirits appearing to di&s;cover where Money has been buried, to direct People to dig for it, has &s;o univer&s;ally prevail'd with Wo|mankind, I might &s;ay and even with Mankind too, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to beat it out of their Heads; and if they &s;hould &s;ee any thing which they call an Apparition, they would to this Day follow it, in hope to hear it give a Stamp on the Ground, as with its Foot, and then vani&s;h; and did it really do &s;o, they would not fail to dig <HI>to the Center</HI> (if they were able) in hopes of finding a Pot of Money hid there, or &s;ome old U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n with A&s;hes and <HI>Roman</HI> Me|dals; in &s;hort, or &s;ome con&s;iderable Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A COUNTRY Gentleman had an old-built Hou&s;e, which was the Remains of an old Demoli&s;hed Mo|na&s;tery or Religious Hou&s;e, and he re&s;olved to have it pull'd down, but thought the Charge too much to be&s;tow; &s;o he bethought him&s;elf of a Stratagem, which was to give it out that the Hou&s;e was haunt|ed, and this he did &s;o artificially, that it began to be currently believed; for he made a Fellow dre&s;s him&s;elf up in White, and pa&s;s &s;wiftly cro&s;s the inner Court of the Hou&s;e, ju&s;t at a time when he had appointed others to be at the Window to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>THEY gave Notice to the Hou&s;e that there was an Apparition; then the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s and all the Family were called up to the Window, where, tho' it was &s;o dark that they could not di&s;tingui&s;h what he was, yet they plainly &s;aw the thing in white go cro&s;s the Yard, and in at a Door of the old Building; &s;oon after it was in they perceiv'd a Fla&s;h of Fire in the Hou&s;e, which was contriv'd that the Fellow &s;hould make with &s;ome Brim&s;tone and other Materials on purpo&s;e, &s;o that it &s;hould leave a Stench of Sulphur behind it, but not be ju&s;t the Smell of Gunpowder.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="395">
AS he expected, it began to work; &s;ome fanciful People having notice of it, and being de&s;irous to &s;ee the &s;ame Apparition, had the occa&s;ion offer'd them, and &s;aw it in its u&s;ual manner of &s;howing it &s;elf; its frequent walking was ordinary, at one part of the Hou&s;e where the Spirit had an opportunity to &s;lip out at a Door into another Yard, and &s;o into the dwelling Hou&s;e; and when it went off that way it gave a great &s;tamp with its Foot, and im|mediately it was gone.</P>
<P>UPON this it was pre&s;ently &s;aid there was Mo|ney hid, and the Gentleman gave it out that he would dig there for it, and mighty eager People were to have it done; however the Gentleman &s;eem'd to cool in the matter: &s;till the Apparition was &s;een to come and go, walk to and again, almo&s;t every Night, and ordinarily it vani&s;h'd in a fla&s;h of Fire as above, which in a word was very extraor|dinary.</P>
<P>AT length &s;ome of the Towns People in the Village adjoyning, finding the Gentleman began to &s;light or neglect it, gave out, that if E&s;quire&mdash;would give them leave, they would dig, for that certainly Money was hid there; nay if he would con&s;ent they &s;hould have it if they found it, they would dig for it and find it too, tho' they digg'd the whole Hou&s;e down.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman reply'd, that was not fair for them to pull his Hou&s;e down and have all they found too, that was too hard; but he would con|&s;ent to this, That provided they would carry away all the Rubbi&s;h, and all the Materials which they dug down, and pile up the Bricks and Timber in the Yard near the Hou&s;e, and would be content with half they found, he would give them leave to dig.</P>
<P>WELL, they con&s;ented, and to work they went; the Spirit or Apparition which appear'd at
<PB N="378" REF="396">
fir&s;t &s;eem'd to point out the Place, and the fir&s;t thing they took down was a great &s;tack of Chim|nies, and a heavy piece of work it was; but the Gentleman, willing to encourage them, &s;ecretly hid &s;even and twenty Pieces of old Gold in a hole in the Chimney, which had no entrance into it but by one pa&s;&s;age, which he Brick'd up.</P>
<P>WHEN they came to this Money they were perfectly deluded, and out of their Wits; the Gen|tleman happen'd to be near, but not ju&s;t upon the Spot when it was found, and he being call'd, very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rankly gave it them all; but upon Condition they &s;hould not expect the like, if they found any more.</P>
<P>IN a word, this Bite made the Country Fellows work like Hor&s;es, and more came into the knot; but that which encourag'd them farther was, they did really find &s;everal things of Value in the pulling down the Hou&s;e, which perhaps had lain hid from the time of Demoli&s;hing it as a religious Hou&s;e; and &s;ome Money was found too; but continual expectation and hope of finding more &s;o animated the Fellows, that in &s;hort they pull'd the whole Hou&s;e down; nay, I might &s;ay they pull'd it up by the Roots, for they dug up the very Foundations, which was what the Gentleman de&s;ir'd, and would have given a great deal of Money to have had done.</P>
<P>NOR did they leave the Hou&s;e in a heap of Rubbi&s;h; but, according to his Agreement with them, they carried the Materials away, and &s;et up the Timber and old Bricks in an adjacent Yard as he directed them, and in good order too.</P>
<P>SO violent was the Per&s;ua&s;ion, that (upon this fancy'd Apparition walking in the Hou&s;e) Money was hid there, that nothing could &s;top the eager|ne&s;s of the Country People in working; as if the Souls of the old Nuns or Friars, or whatever they were who had hid any Trea&s;ure there, &s;uppo&s;ing any was hid, could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> be at Re&s;t, as was &s;aid in

other Ca&s;es, or could be any way concern'd for the finding it &s;o many Years afterward, being almo&s;t two hundred Years.</P>
<P>IF they could &s;uppo&s;e any thing &s;o weak, where mu&s;t they &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Departed Souls or Gho&s;ts could have been, during all that time? and why did they not appear before? what had all the Ages be|tween done to be &s;o much le&s;s in their Favour, that they did not come to di&s;cover this Money to them? but that the Depo&s;it &s;hould remain un <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r Ground &s;o long, without any enquiry after t, 'till this Age, not at all more worthy than their Ance&s;tors, &s;hould be inform'd of it.</P>
<P>THERE is not a thing in Nature &s;o generally receiv'd, which has &s;o little Foundation, either in Rea&s;on or Religion, either in Nature or common Sen&s;e; it &s;eems not only ab&s;urd, but ridiculous; there is not only no religious Rea&s;on in it, but it is incon&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf: what &s;eems only won|derful and unaccountable in it is, that &s;uch gro&s;s things &s;hould make &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions, and that it &s;hould be &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to beat it out of the Heads of the po&s;&s;e&s;s'd People.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould offer to tell them that no hidden Money was ever thus di&s;cover'd, they would laugh at it as the greate&s;t Je&s;t imaginable, and tell you there were five hundred Examples to the contrary; and yet in all my Search after tho&s;e things, and after evidence of Fact, I cannot arrive to one Example, where ever an Apparition directed to the finding Money hid in the Ground or Earth, or any other place, and that any Authentick Voucher has been brought to prove it. I know there have been many, perhaps thou&s;ands, of &s;uch Stories told, and the Parti|culars are handed down with them; but I &s;ay I never met with any Authentick Proof of the Fact, &s;uch as that the Story might be told after them for Truth, and that a Man might &s;ay without Blu&s;hing that he
<PB N="380" REF="398">
believ'd it. And let us but enter a little into the u&s;ual manner in which tho&s;e Tales are related, there &s;eems to be &s;omething &s;o weak and &s;illy in the telling, as if it was only calculated for Children and Chimney corners: for Example; the Apparition is call'd a Gho&s;t, 'tis dre&s;s'd up (to &s;uit the weak|ne&s;s of the Imagination) in a Shrowd, as if it came ju&s;t out of the Coffin and the Church-yard, and as if the Habit of the Dead was a&s;&s;um'd, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the People with the Fancy of its being really the dead Body of the Per&s;on, and yet allow it at the &s;ame time to be a Spirit.</P>
<P>WELL, when it comes, and (be it what you will) forms it &s;elf in Apparition, all in white, and in a Shroud; what is next? it &s;ays nothing to you, but goes away before you; and perhaps &s;peaks and bids you go or come along with it, or perhaps without &s;peaking at all, leading and beckoning the Parties they have appear'd to, to follow them, and then &s;tamping with the Foot it di&s;appears at once.</P>
<P>THIS Stamp with the Foot is reckon'd to be a Direction to you to dig ju&s;t there, in order to find &s;ome extraordinary Trea&s;ure; and he would be reckon'd very &s;tupid and &s;ordidly dull that &s;hould neglect the Direction, and not dig there; and many a vain and fruitle&s;s Pit has been dug on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, to no purpo&s;e at all.</P>
<P>BUT that I may not declare my Infidelity in the&s;e things in an unrea&s;onable manner, and disbe|lieve without any ju&s;t Rea&s;on; let me give you a long Story, which &s;eems to be left upon Record, of a Pedlar in the Town of&mdash;in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> a Story believ'd as certainly as the Go&s;pel; and which it would be thought very ab&s;urd for any one to que&s;tion the Truth of.</P>
<P>THERE was a Pedlar, <HI>&s;ays the Story,</HI> who us'd to travel about the Country with his Pack, but
<PB N="381" REF="399">
kept a Chamber or Ware-hou&s;e in the Market-Town for the depo&s;iting and laying up &s;ome Goods which he had there, and which were too many at a time to carry them all about with him.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that this Man having been abroad late, and coming home with his Pack, &s;at him&s;elf down upon a Stile, re&s;ting his Pack at the &s;ame time for his Ea&s;e: while he &s;at here, there came up to him a Gho&s;t, in the Appearance of a Woman dre&s;s'd as above; &s;he came up to him with a &s;miling Countenance, and when &s;he di&s;cover'd her &s;elf &s;he &s;tept backward, and holding up a fine white Hand beckoned to him with a Finger to follow her.</P>
<P>THE Pedlar, frighted as he was, immediately follow'd the Apparition; (what he did in the mean time with his Pack that's a gap in the Story, which Tradition has not &s;upply'd;) the Apparition leads him in this manner, going backward and beckon|ing with her Hand over two or three Fields, 'till it came to a particular place, where there lay a great Stone, and there giving a &s;tamp with its Foot it vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE Man takes the hint, marks the Stone, goes home to carry his Pack, as we ought to &s;up|po&s;e, and comes out the next Night with a Spade and a Pick Axe, and goes to work to dig a great Pitt in the Earth.</P>
<P>HE had not dug far it &s;eems, (tho' the Story does not &s;ay expre&s;ly how far) but he found a large Che&s;t; I &s;ay large, for it could not be a &s;mall one, by what you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>HE doubled his Diligence when he came to the Che&s;t, and with great Labour at length got it out of the place; and we may &s;uppo&s;e was not long be|fore he found means to &s;plit it open, and get into the in&s;ide of it to &s;ee the Contents; for he found it very heavy when he labour'd to get it out.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="400">
IN a word, he found the Che&s;t full of Silver, that is to &s;ay, full of Money; then keeping his own Council, he took care to depo&s;ite it &s;o, that by &s;ome and &s;ome he got the Money all &s;afe home, and after that carried the Che&s;t home al&s;o.</P>
<P>WHAT the Sum was that he found here, the Story is not particular in; but it &s;eems the bulk was &s;uch, that the Pedlar thought fit to leave off his travel|ling about the Country as a Pedlar, takes a Hou&s;e in the Town, furni&s;hes him&s;elf a Shop, and becomes a &s;ettled Inhabitant and Shop-keeper. During his appearing in this Figure, it happen'd that the Pari&s;h Church being exceeding old and out of Repair, the Pari&s;hioners, (whether by order of the Dioce&s;an up|on a Vi&s;itation, or by the voluntary act and deed of them&s;elves the Pari&s;hioners, I know not,) re&s;olv'd to Repair the Church.</P>
<P>IN order to furni&s;h the needful Sums for this good Work, they call a Ve&s;try, and propo&s;e a Sub|&s;cription of the Inhabitants, for &s;upporting the Ex|pence; &s;o the Mini&s;ter and Church Wardens go about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e to &s;ee what the Chari|table Pari&s;hioners would contribute, and among the re&s;t they at length came to the Pedlar's (now Shop|keeper's) Hou&s;e, and he being told their Bu&s;ine&s;s de&s;ires them to walk in.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, and perhaps treating his Neighbours, he asks for their Roll or Sub&s;crip|tion Paper, in order to &s;ub&s;cribe; looking over the Roll he &s;ees Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>&mdash;five Pounds, another Gentleman five Pounds, another ten Pounds, another forty Shillings, and &s;o on: Come, &s;ays he, give a poor Pedlar the Pen and Ink; Will your Gentry &s;ub|&s;cribe no more than that? &s;o he takes the Pen, and &s;ub&s;cribes five and twenty Pounds.</P>
<P>SOME time after this, having Occa&s;ion to make a Hatch to his Shop-Door, as in the Country is very frequent, it happen'd, that &s;ending for a Workman
<PB N="383" REF="401">
to make this Hatch, and looking about among his old Lumber, he found nothing &s;o proper as the old Che&s;t that the Money was found in, and ac|cordingly a Hatch was made of it.</P>
<P>A-WHILE after this, as the Pedlar was &s;itting in his Shop, he ob&s;erv'd an Ancient Gentleman who liv'd in the Town, and who had the Reputa|tion of a Scholar, and particularly of a great Anti|quary, &s;tood poring very earne&s;tly, with his Specta|cles on, upon his new Hatch: This brought the Pedlar to the Door, who after waiting a good while to &s;ee what it was the old Gentleman had di&s;cover'd, at la&s;t he ask'd him what it was he found upon his new Hatch, that was worth &s;o much of his notice.</P>
<P>TRULY Neighbour, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> what I ob&s;erve is very remarkable, tho' I cannot tell the Meaning of it; and I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis in a Character that you cannot ea&s;ily read, as well as in a Lan|guage that you may not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>THE Pedlar de&s;ir'd he would read it to him.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> you do not under&s;tand it, when I have read it.</P>
<P>BUT Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Pedlar,</HI> can you not tell the meaning of it in <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the old Gentleman,</HI> it is the old <HI>Saxon Engli&s;h</HI> in the ancient <HI>Gothic</HI> Character, and it may be read thus,
<Q><L>Where This once &s;tood</L>
<L>Stands another twice as good.</L></Q></P>
<P>HUM! <HI>&s;ays the Pedlar,</HI> that's old &s;tuff indeed: what can that &s;ignify?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays the old Gentleman,</HI> that I don't know, for who can tell where this &s;tood?</P>
<P>AY, who indeed!? <HI>&s;ays the Pedlar:</HI> and if they did, what can there be in that?</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="402">
THEY had a little more Chat of that kind; but in &s;hort <HI>the Pedlar</HI> got rid of his old Gentleman as &s;oon as he could, and began to ruminate upon the thing; <HI>where this &s;tood!</HI> Why I know well enough, <HI>&s;ays he to him&s;elf,</HI> where this &s;tood; I mu&s;t go and &s;ee, it may be there is &s;ome more of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT then he argued, why this is &s;o many Years ago (&s;ix or &s;even at lea&s;t, it &s;eems) and if it was a Gho&s;t or Spirit that &s;how'd me the way to it, I warrant &s;he has &s;how'd &s;ome body el&s;e the way to the re&s;t: Indeed I did not de&s;erve it, that I did not look farther when I was at it; to be &s;ure it's gone by this time.</P>
<P>THUS he argued him&s;elf almo&s;t out of the thing again, 'till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t length he told his Wife of it, who it &s;eems had been in the Secret before.</P>
<P>WHY, you are mad, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> why don't you go immediately to the place?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I don't know whether I can find it again or no, now.</P>
<P>WHAT, <HI>&s;ays his Wife,</HI> mu&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> come to &s;how it you again? &s;ure you an't &s;o dull, but you may find it again.</P>
<P>WELL, the Man went however; indeed his Wife drove him out almo&s;t, Go, try, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you can but come without it.</P>
<P>HE goes, and found the place in general, but could not di&s;tingui&s;h the particular Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, which was levell'd partly by him&s;elf when he fill'd up the Hole again, and partly grown up with Gra&s;s and Weeds; &s;o he comes back again, and tells his Wife, he could not tell which was the Place, &s;o as to be particular enough to go to Work</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays his Wife,</HI> go in the Night; I war|rant you the good <HI>Devil</HI> that &s;how'd you the fir&s;t will put you in &s;ome way to find the re&s;t, if there is any more.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="403">
SO prevail'd with by his Wife's Importunity away he went, and I think they &s;ay his Wife went with him; being come to the Place, the Ap|parition appear'd to them again, and &s;how'd them, in the &s;ame manner as before, the very Spot; and then vani&s;h'd.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Man went to work, and digging a little deeper than he did before, he found ano|ther Che&s;t or Coffer, bounded about with Iron, not &s;o big as the other, but richer; for as the fir&s;t was full of Silver, &s;o this was full of Gold.</P>
<P>THEY carry'd it home with Joy enough, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, and opening it, found (as above) a very great Trea&s;ure. Fame has not handed down the Sum; but &s;omething may be gue&s;s'd at by the latter part of the Story, <HI>which is told thus.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;eems that all this while the Repair of the Church (mention'd above) went on but &s;lowly; ac|cording to the old Saying, <HI>it was Church-Work;</HI> and a Ve&s;try being call'd upon &s;ome other Church|work, the Pedlar, who was pre&s;ent among the re&s;t of his Neighbours, took occa&s;ion to complain, that he thought that Bu&s;ine&s;s was not hone&s;tly manag'd, that it was indeed like <HI>Church-Work,</HI> carried on heavily.</P>
<P>SOME of the Gentlemen took him up a little, and told him, he took too much upon him; that it was none of his Affair; that he was not in Tru&s;t for the Work; that they to whom it was committed knew their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he &s;hould let it alone, and mind his Shop.</P>
<P>HE an&s;wer'd, it was true, that he was not tru&s;t|ed with it, if he had, it &s;hould have been fini&s;hed before now; and that he had a right to complain, becau&s;e he paid to it as well as other People; ad|ding, that if they did not di&s;patch, he would com|plain to the Bi&s;hop, and obtain another Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="404">
THIS alarm'd the People entru&s;ted, &s;o they gave him good Words, and told him, the truth was, the Pari&s;h Stock was almo&s;t gone, and that they had not Money to go on, 'till the Gentlemen would come into a &s;econd Collection.</P>
<P>SAY you &s;o? &s;ays the Pedlar; there may be &s;ome Rea&s;on in that; you can't go on indeed without Money; but pray how much do you want?</P>
<P>THEY told him it would co&s;t near two hundred Pounds more to fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h it, and do but indifferently neither; for the Roof wanted to be taken off, and they feared the Timber was rotten, and would require &s;o much Addition, they were afraid to look into it.</P>
<P>IN a word, he bid the Church-wardens call a Ve&s;try upon that particular Affair, and he would put them in a way to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>A VESTRY was call'd; the Pedlar told them, that &s;eeing they were poor, and could not rai&s;e Money to go on with it, they &s;hould leave it to him, and he would fini&s;h it for them.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY he took the Work upon him&s;elf, laid out near a Thou&s;and Pounds, and al|mo&s;t new-built the Church; in Memory of which, on the Gla&s;s-windows, there &s;tand the Figures of the Pedlar and his Pack, and (as the People fancy) there is al&s;o the Apparition beckoning to him, to come to the Place where he dug up the Money.</P>
<P>THUS far the Story. How Traditio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> came to hand it down to us in this manner, and &s;o turn it into a Fable, I have nothing to do with; but the real and more probable Part of the Tale is recorded thus.</P>
<P>THAT there was a <HI>Pether,</HI> &s;o the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> calls him, that is a <HI>Pedl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> who having long u&s;ed to travel up and down the Country with his Hor&s;e, and his Wife, and him&s;elf, all three loaded with their Goods, and going from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e for many Years, was grown rich, by his Indu&s;try; and that being too old to continue the laborious
<PB N="387" REF="405">
Part, he took a Lodging, fir&s;t in the Town, and &s;old his Goods in a Chamber, and in the Markets only, but afterward took a Hou&s;e and a Shop in the Mar|ket-place, and drove a great Trade.</P>
<P>THAT growing thus to be very rich, he con|tributed, upon their fir&s;t coming about for a Sub|&s;cription, twenty five Pounds towards the Repair of the Church; and after that, finding they want|ed Money to fini&s;h it, took the Work wholly in|to his own Hand, and fini&s;h'd the Church at his own Charge; and that the Pari&s;h, in Gratitude to his Memory, cau&s;ed that Figure of the Pedlar to be painted upon the Gla&s;s, where the Pedlar and his Pack is repre&s;ented in one Place travelling about the Country, by which he got his Living.</P>
<P>IN another Place, there are Workmen digging the Foundation of the Church, and the Pedlar giving them Directions what to do, and how to proceed; and in another, the Church is built up a great way, and almo&s;t to the Roof, and the Pedlar &s;till directing.</P>
<P>IN another Place, an Angel is painted &s;tanding by the Pedlar, and pointing with a Rod or Staff in his Hand, to a Place where the Pedlar &s;ets two Workmen to dig.</P>
<P>NOW from the Pedlar's being grown &s;o unex|pectdly rich, common Fame it &s;eems rai&s;ed a Re|port, that he had found a Che&s;t of Money in the Ground, and after that another. It &s;eems al&s;o, there is an Original for the two Ver&s;es too, which is thus: when the Pedlar had fir&s;t contributed twenty five Pounds towards building the Church, and yet the Pari&s;honers told him, they could not go on for want of Money; he told them they &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, he had given them one Bag of Money, and, &s;ays he, <HI>where that &s;tood, &s;tands another twice as good:</HI> I'll do it my &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="406">
HENCE they thought the Pedlar mu&s;t certainly have found &s;ome Money that had been hid in the Ground, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> had di&s;cover'd it to him; and &s;o came the whole Story to grow up by little and little into the Form as I have told it; and now to confirm it farther, they tell us the Angel, which perhaps might be but indifferently painted on the Gla&s;s, or on the Wall of the Church, is taken for the Gho&s;t that di&s;cover'd the two Che&s;ts of Money to the Pedlar, and is &s;howing where to dig for it.</P>
<P>THUS the Story of an Apparition is handed on to Po&s;terity, and now 'tis as curr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly believ'd in the Country, almo&s;t as the Go&s;pel; and any Man would be thought very bold, that &s;hould pretend to contradict it, or to &s;ay that it is not true in e|very Particular.</P>
<P>IF all the Stories of Apparitions leading Peo|ple to dig for Money, were as well trac'd as this, I believe they might be found as plainly fictitious. In|vention has been mighty fruitful upon this particu|lar kind of Notion, that when Money is hidden &s;ome Spirit or Apparition will di&s;cover it; as if the Souls of tho&s;e that hid the Money were di&s;turb'd, 'till it was found out and made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>HOW ab&s;urd the very Sugge&s;tion it &s;elf is, I can hardly think worth while to &s;peak of again; but there are other Difficulties in it al&s;o, if an Appari|tion knows of and di&s;covers this Money.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHY not di&s;cover it &s;ooner? Why let it lie in the Ground, &s;ometimes two or three hundred Years before it has been di&s;cover'd? and then an Apparition comes, from none knows where, to bring it to light.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHY is the Di&s;covery made to a Stranger, and not to &s;ome of the Line or Race of tho&s;e to whom the Money did at fir&s;t belong? One would &s;uppo&s;e the Apparition came, or was &s;ent, or directed
<PB N="389" REF="407">
to come, to do Ju&s;tice, and to give the Money lo&s;t to the right Owner; whereas the&s;e Di&s;coveries are often pretended to be made to Strangers, who have no Claim or any Right to it, or any Relation to tho&s;e who laid it there; and this indeed is unac|countable, and makes the re&s;t of the Story impro|bable to be true.</P>
<P N="3">3. If Gho&s;ts, or Apparitions, and Spirits, or call them what you will, are thus officious, and bu&s;y to di&s;cover Money hid in the Earth, &s;o as to run up and down to Strangers, who are no way related to it, or to the Race or Families who were fir&s;t concern'd in it; Why then do they not di&s;cover all the Money that is thus depo&s;ited in the Dark? and which no doubt is yet in great Quantities, lodged out of the Reach of Mortal Sight, and of which we find frequent Di&s;coveries made; as par|ticularly a great Parcel of old Gold, found lately in the digging up the old Foundation of a Hou&s;e in <HI>Oxford&s;hire.</HI> A great Parcel of <HI>Roman</HI> Gold Coin and Medals found this very Year, in digging up an old Vault in <HI>France,</HI> and which mu&s;t have lain there a thou&s;and Years at lea&s;t, and no kind Apparition came to di&s;cover it in &s;o long time.</P>
<P>MANY &s;uch Examples are daily &s;hown us of Money found Under-ground, without the Help of the <HI>Devil,</HI> or of any Apparition, Spirit or Gho&s;t, to di&s;cover it, and which had lain, ever &s;ince the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> conceal'd and unknown.</P>
<P>FROM all which Rea&s;ons I mu&s;t conclude, that the departed Spirits know nothing of the&s;e things, that it is not in their Power to di&s;cover their old Hoards of Money, or to come hither to &s;how us how we may come at it; but that in &s;hort, all the old Women's Stories, which we have told us upon that Subject, are indeed old Women's Stories, and no more.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="408">
I CANNOT quit this part of my Subject with|out ob&s;erving that, indeed, if we give up all the Stories of Gho&s;ts and Apparitions, and Spirits walk|ing, to di&s;cover Money that is hid, we &s;hall lo&s;e to the Age half the good old Tales, which &s;erve to make up Winter Evening Conver&s;ation, and &s;hall deprive the Doctrine of Souls departed coming back hither to talk with us about &s;uch things, of its principal Support; for this indeed is one of the principal Errands &s;uch Apparitions come about.</P>
<P>IT is without Doubt, that Fancy and Imagina|tion form a world of Apparitions in the Minds of Men and Women; (for we mu&s;t not exclude the Ladies in this Part, whatever we do) and People go away as thoroughly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Reality of having &s;een the <HI>Devil,</HI> as if they convers'd Face to Face with him; when in &s;hort the Matter is no more than a Vapour of the Brain, a &s;ick delirious fume of Smoke in the Hypochondria; forming it &s;elf in &s;uch and &s;uch Figure to the Eye-&s;ight of the Mind, as well as of the Head, which all look'd upon with a calm Revi&s;ion, would appear, as it really is, nothing but a Nothing, a Skeleton of the Brain, a Whym&s;y, and no more.</P>

<P>IT is out of Que&s;tion that the Imagination forms a great many of the&s;e Vi&s;ions in the Heads of the People that relate them again to us; and they as firmly believe them to be real Apparitions, as I be|lieve them to be nothing but Vapours and Cloud.

<P>NOR could they be &s;o much blam'd as in other Ca&s;es, for here were People e&s;cap'd from the Mur|therers, even out of their very Hands; &s;ome that had &s;een their Wives, Children, Fathers, Mothers,
<PB N="392" REF="410">
Husbands, Neighbours butcher'd before their Fa|ces; and no Wonder if the&s;e had the Images of Death before their Eyes, after they arriv'd; no Wonder if they had Apparitions and Vi&s;ions of the like Mi&s;chiefs every Hour.</P>
<P>NO Wonder if they &s;aw Clouds of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Armies in the Air, heard Shrieks of dying murther'd Women and Children, and that they vouch'd the&s;e things with the utmo&s;t Solemnity. Now 'tis true in the common Notions of Humanity, one cou'd not but pity tho&s;e poor People, and give allowance to their Fears, and to the Fright and Horrors that were upon their Minds; yet it does not at all fol|low that we, who are not under the &s;ame Impre&s;|&s;ions, mu&s;t come into the Delu&s;ion with them, give up our Under&s;tanding and our Rea&s;on to their imagin'd Vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>WE are to judge of tho&s;e things by the Rules by which we ought to judge in like Ca&s;es, and after you have made Allowances for the Terrors and Fright which the poor People might be in then, we &s;hould con&s;ider the rational Part, for where the Apparition is real, the Rational Part is always apparent as well as the Vi&s;ionary Part: for Exam|ple,</P>
<P>WHAT Apparitions came from a good Hand, and for the good of the innocent People, who&s;e Dangers were &s;o imminent, would certainly come in &s;ome Space of Time before the Danger, either &s;o as to give Opportunity of E&s;cape, or at lea&s;t Preparatory Warnings, that the People might have time to look up to Heaven, which the butchering Enemy would not &s;pare them; and &s;uch Appariti|ons as the&s;e I &s;hould be inclin'd to give the mo&s;t Heed to; but of the&s;e we read of very few.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, to what Purpo&s;e could Ap|paritions &s;how them&s;elves afterward? and from whom did they come? If the Souls of the murther'd
<PB N="393" REF="411">
Prote&s;tants cou'd appear and cry for Re|venge, why did they not all appear, as well as one Woman at <HI>Bandon-Bridge?</HI> Why did they not Haunt the Murtherers in a mo&s;t frightful manner, and terrify them Night and Day, 'till they brought their own Guilt to be the wor&s;t of Apparitions to them?</P>
<P>WHY did not the Terror of Blood lie upon them, like a con&s;tant <HI>Devil</HI> harra&s;&s;ing their Souls, and terrifying them 'till they were made their own Executioners? We &s;aw none of the&s;e Things hap|pen either to them, or to the Murtherers, Actors and Directors of the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Ma&s;&s;acre. <HI>Charles</HI> IX. King of <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nce,</HI> by who&s;e Direction it was all manag'd, died as compos'd, without any Repentance for it, as if he had never been concern'd in it; calmly giving Directions for the Admini&s;tration of the Affairs of the Government after him, and told his Mother how to act with the Hugonots, 'till his Brother the King of <HI>Poland</HI> &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Ireland</HI> the Prie&s;ts and Zealots, nay the very Women, boa&s;ted of the Number they had kill'd; &s;how'd the Skeins or Daggers with which they cut the Throats of the Prote&s;tants; one &s;o many, and another &s;o many; their Soldiers fought as fear|le&s;s after it as before, nor did any Apparition haunt them, that ever I met with any Account of.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, for the <HI>Devil</HI>'s di&s;turbing them, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on in it; the <HI>Devil</HI> was not at all di&s;pleas'd with the Fact; what &s;hould he di&s;turb them for? he wou'd rather appear to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, encourage them, harden them in it, take all Re|mor&s;e from them, and reproach them with Cowar|dice if they &s;hew'd the lea&s;t Inclination to Pity; tho' I don't hear of the lea&s;t Blame the <HI>Devil</HI> him|&s;elf could lay upon them of that kind.</P>
<P>AS to Apparitions after it was over, I do not &s;ee Room to think them &s;o much as Rational;
<PB N="394" REF="412">
there was not the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion of them, or U&s;e for them; the Mi&s;chief was done; what could the invi&s;ible World have to &s;ay to any body about it after it was done? We do not read of any Ap|paritions, Voices, Noi&s;es, Signs, or Wonders at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> after the Temple was de&s;troy'd, tho' a|bove a Million of People are &s;aid (by <HI>Jo&s;ephus)</HI> to have peri&s;hed there. There were Signs and hor|rible Noi&s;es, Apparitions and Voices before it, in &s;everal Places, but none after it; the mi&s;erable Dead lay quiet in their Heaps, <HI>Graves they could not be call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> and gave neither their Friends or Enemies any Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>TO conclude: The &s;ham Apparitions which Peo|ple put upon them&s;elves are indeed very many; and our Hypochondriack People &s;ee more <HI>Devils</HI> at noon-day than <HI>Galilaeus</HI> did Stars, and more by ma|ny than ever really appear'd. But this no ways Im|peaches the main Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> That there are really and truly Apparitions of various kinds; and that Spirits or Angels (call them what we will) In|habitants of the invi&s;ible and empty Spaces, do vi&s;it us here upon many Occa&s;ions, either for Good or Evil, as He who made them is pleas'd to direct.</P>
<P>THE general End and De&s;ign of Providence in &s;uffering &s;uch things, and the U&s;e and Application to our &s;elves, which we are directed to make of them in common Prudence; how far they are, or are not mercifully re&s;train'd from hurting us, and even from terrifying and affrighting us, if our Rea&s;on could be our Governour in &s;uch Ca&s;es, with a great Number of Examples in Story of the effect of &s;uch Apparitions as have been allow'd to vi&s;it Mankind, whether peaceably or otherwi&s;e; the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> would take up a great deal more room: But I am run my length in the pre&s;ent Relation, and the Reader mu&s;t be content to draw Con&s;equences for him&s;elf from what is &s;aid, to guide his Judgment in
<PB N="395" REF="413">
the variety of &s;uch Ca&s;es as may happen: his only way, in our Opinion, is to keep an even pace between Apprehen&s;ion and Contempt; neither to fear or de&s;ire them; but re&s;olve to act with the Calmne&s;s and Courage of a Chri&s;tian, in whatever may be his Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT above all I would beg my reading merry Friends of the <HI>thoughtle&s;s kind</HI> not to be &s;o much &s;urpriz'd at the Apparitions of their own Brain; not to &s;tart and be frighted when they fir&s;t make <HI>Devils</HI> by Day-light, and then &s;ee them in the dark; and as they may be a&s;&s;ur'd they will hardly ever &s;ee any thing wor&s;e than them&s;elves, &s;o let them re&s;olve not to be &s;car'd at Shadows, or amus'd with Vapours; mi&s;taking the <HI>Devil</HI> for an A&s;s, and tell us of the Saucer Eyes of a Pink-eyed Bear; not fancy they &s;ee a Hear&s;e with headle&s;s Hor&s;es, and take the Night Cart for a fiery Cha|riot, which one would think they might di&s;tingui&s;h by their No&s;es, unle&s;s they will own that their Fear gave them a wor&s;e Smell than that of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
