<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Publick having gi|ven
a general Approba|tion
of the late Tryal,
between the Marquis <HI>DE
GESVRES</HI> and his Lady,
as indeed &s;o nice and cu|rious
a Subject de&s;erv'd: I was inclin'd
to &s;earch our own Law-Books and Hi|&s;torians,
to &s;ee what adjudg'd Ca&s;es and
Precedents we had of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>That which is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory was, the Ca&s;e of
the Earl of <HI>ESSEX,</HI> and the Lady <HI>HOW|ARD</HI>;
a Ca&s;e that engag'd the Poli|ticks
of the greate&s;t State&s;men, and
the Ca&s;ui&s;try of a Monarch him&s;elf.
There has as yet been a great Defect
of Information concerning this Ca&s;e,
which the Reader will now find &s;upplied
from an Original <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> of Arch-bi&s;hop
<HI>ABBOT</HI>'s, written in his own
<PB REF="3">
Hand. This <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> contains an
exact Account of all the Artifice and
Stratagem u&s;ed in that Affair, and is
not only very full and particular upon
the Ca&s;e, but lets us into a con&s;iderable
Part of the Secrets and Politicks of
King <HI>JAMES</HI>'s Reign. I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure the
Publick, that it is faithfully printed
from the Original, which is now in the
Hands of a learned Lawyer.</P>
<P>To make a Collection of this Nature,
as perfect as I well could, there is
added the Lord <HI>AUDLEY</HI>'s Tryal, and
the Proceedings upon the Duke of
<HI>Norfolk</HI>'s <HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Divorce,</HI> which, as
they bear &s;ome Relation to this Subject,
&s;o they are now very rare, and va|luable.
The Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>'s Ca&s;e,
in particular, employ'd &s;ome of our
greate&s;t Lawyers, who have made &s;ince
very eminent Figures in their Profe&s;|&s;ion,
and contains all that can be &s;aid
upon the Article of <HI>Divorce.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, the&s;e Volumes complete
the Account of Ca&s;es of this kind,
and I dare promi&s;e will prove u&s;e|ful
and entertaining to the Reader.</P>

<HEAD>SOME
ACCOUNT
OF
Archbi&s;hop ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>_GEORGE ABBOT, <HI>D.D.</HI>
was born at <HI>Guilford</HI> in
<HI>Surrey,</HI> and bred at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI>
where he became
Ma&s;ter of <HI>Univer&s;ity
College, An.</HI> 1604. upon
the Tran&s;lation of Dr. <HI>Bancroft</HI> from
the See of <HI>London</HI> to the Archbi&s;hoprick
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> he was made Bi&s;hop
of that See; and in the Year 1611. at
the decea&s;e of <HI>Bancroft,</HI> &s;ucceeded him
in that honourable Po&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1619. He founded a large Ho&s;|pital
at the Place of his Birth, him&s;elf
laying the fir&s;t Stone, and endow'd it
with a liberal Maintenance.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1621. As he was hunting in
<HI>Burnhill</HI> Park, belonging to my Lord
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Zouch,</HI> near <HI>Hertford</HI> Bridge, he kill'd
the Keeper by chance with a forked
Arrow out of a Cro&s;s-bow, as he was
&s;hooting at a Deer. The Quaere was,
Whether he &s;hould incur the Penalty
of Irregularity by this involuntary
Man&s;laughter, or Su&s;pen&s;ion? but he
was acquitted from either; yet him|&s;elf
out of a religious Tenderne&s;s of
Mind, kept a &s;olemn Anniver&s;ary Fa&s;t
during his whole Life; and made a
&s;ufficient Provi&s;ion for the Keeper's
Widow and Children.</P>
<P>He govern'd the Church with great
Prudence, and was in much E&s;teem
with the People and the moderate
Clergy, but in the Year 1627. many
Di&s;contents ari&s;ing, he was by the
Clamour of &s;ome turbulent Per&s;ons,
&s;eque&s;tred from his Office and Juri&s;|diction,
tho' in a very &s;hort Time he
was graciou&s;ly receiv'd again into Fa|vour.</P>
<P>He was an eminent Preacher, and
it is univer&s;ally agreed that Gravity,
Learning, and Piety, adorn'd his Life.
He died at <HI>Lambeth, An.</HI> 1633.</P>

<HEAD>SOME
MEMORIALS
TOUCHING
The Nullity between the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and his Lady, pronounc'd <HI>Sept.</HI>
25, 1613, at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and the
Difficulties endur'd in the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>_BEing at the Court at <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
on the 12th of <HI>May,</HI>
1613, or thereabouts, his
Maje&s;ty mov'd me, that I
would be a Commi&s;&s;ioner in
a Controver&s;y to be begun
between the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and his Lady,
for the &s;eparating of them; and when his
Maje&s;ty had ended tho&s;e few Words with
<PB N="4" REF="10">
me, my Lord Chamberlain, who was then
in the Gallery, &s;pake al&s;o unto me to that
Purpo&s;e. It was unto me a Matter very
&s;trange, having heard before of &s;ome Di&s;|contentments
between that noble Couple;
but never imagining that Matters were
come to that Head. My An&s;wer was alike
to both, <HI>That I did not know the Ground
whereupon they intended to move; but that if
I were to be a judge in any &s;uch Que&s;tion, I
would pray, that other Bi&s;hops, being near the
Town and Court, might be join'd with me.</HI> The
Per&s;ons that were nam'd then, were, my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> and my
Lord of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> (for at that Time was
my Lord of <HI>Bath</HI> with the Queen's Maje|&s;ty
at <HI>Bath.</HI>) Be&s;ides, I pray'd both the
King's Maje&s;ty, and my Lord Chamberlain,
<HI>That before any &s;uch Thing were enter'd into,
I might &s;peak privately with my Lord of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>,
for the &s;atisfying of mine own Mind</HI>; which
by both was permitted unto me. The Day
after, I &s;ent for the Earl, and having pri|vate
Speech with him, only about the A|bility
of his Body, and nothing el&s;e, I
found him generally much re&s;erv'd in Talk,
but only avowing the Ability of him&s;elf
for Generation; and that he was re&s;olv'd
never to lay any Blemi&s;h upon him&s;elf
that Way. I knew not well what to make
of this; for I did not then under&s;tand,
that &s;ome Lords had met before at <HI>White-Hall</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11">
on both Parts, (the Lord Privy-Seal, the
Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of <HI>Southamp|ton,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Knowles,</HI> as afterwards I
heard) to &s;ettle an Order by Con&s;ent, how
this Pro&s;ecution &s;hould be; that is to &s;ay,
That a Separation &s;hould be made, and my
Lord's Honour every Way pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Within a Day or two, coming to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
I had &s;peech with the Lord Cham|berlain,
in the Gallery going towards St.
<HI>James</HI>'s Park. I might not reveal all Par|ticulars
of that which pa&s;s'd in private;
but yet I told his Lord&s;hip, <HI>That I had &s;po|ken
with the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex, <HI>and I perceiv'd it
was like to be a Matter of great Difficulty, and
therefore wi&s;h'd his Lord&s;hip to be well advis'd,
before any thing was brought into Publick.</HI> I
told him, <HI>That he mu&s;t proceed either upon
Confe&s;&s;ion or Proof: That it was probable, the
Earl would not confe&s;s his own Impotency, for
then he blemi&s;h'd him&s;elf: That my Lady's
Oath in that Ca&s;e, was not &s;ufficient; and how
other Proofs might be had, I could not conceive:
That the Earl in open E&s;timation was to be
thought an able Man: That his Father was not
thought in that Kind un&s;ufficient.</HI> The Lord
Chamberlain reply'd, <HI>That, perhaps, the Fa|ther's
Sin was puni&s;h'd upon the Son: That it
was Truth, that the Earl had no Ink in his
Pen: That him&s;elf had confe&s;s'd, that he could
not know a Woman, and that, before divers
Noblemen, and &s;ome of them his own Friends,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<HI>naming, as I remember, the Earls of</HI> Nor|thampton
<HI>and</HI> Worce&s;ter<HI>, and the Lord</HI>
Knowles. All this while I never dream'd
of <HI>impotentia ver&s;us hanc,</HI> but conceiv'd, that
they would charge the Earl &s;imply with
Di&s;ability. The Lord Chamberlain then
&s;eem'd unto me fully re&s;olv'd to procceed,
and told me whom he would have in the
Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>The Bi&s;hops of</HI> London, Ely,
<HI>and</HI> Litchfield, <HI>the two Chancellors of the</HI> Exche|quer
<HI>and</HI> Dutchy, <HI>my Judges</HI>; (for &s;o he
call'd them) <HI>Sir</HI> Daniel Dun, <HI>Sir</HI> John
Bennet, <HI>Dr.</HI> James, <HI>and Dr.</HI> Edwards. I
told his Lord&s;hip, <HI>That I lik'd the Per&s;ons
very well.</HI> The next News I heard, was
about a Day or two after, <HI>That the Commi&s;|&s;ion
was out under the Great Seal</HI>; which I
wonder'd at, by Rea&s;on that I thought,
that my Words to the Lord Chamberlain
being well weigh'd, would have mov'd
&s;ome longer Con&s;ideration. Well: The
Commi&s;&s;ion is brought; it is accepted, and
Proceeding decreed; the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> is
call'd; the Libel is put in. When we &s;aw
it, and that it contain'd <HI>impotentia ver&s;us
hanc,</HI> mo&s;t of us, who were not acquainted
with the Project before, were much amaz'd
at it. I told the Council for my Lady,
<HI>That they had laid a very narrow Bridge for
them&s;elves to go over:</HI> So &s;aid my Lord of
<HI>London,</HI> and divers of the re&s;t; only my
Lord of <HI>Ely</HI> was &s;till &s;ilent. My Lord of
<PB N="7" REF="13">
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> two &s;everal Times, utter'd Spee|ches,
as much grieving and repining at
this Controver&s;y: <HI>That he was Ordinary to
the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex, <HI>and had been in his Hou&s;e
at</HI> Chartely, <HI>which he &s;aw to be well govern'd;
and the Earl did bear him&s;elf mo&s;t religiou&s;ly
therein, to his great Comfort: That his Wife
had the Honour to be Cou&s;in Germain to the
Counte&s;s of</HI> Suffolk<HI>; and therefore he had no
Rea&s;on but to wi&s;h well to the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>and
his Lady both. Yet if he had been worthy to
be con&s;ulted withal, he &s;hould have thought that
&s;even Years had been little enough to have deli|berated,
whether it were fit to bring &s;uch a
Bu&s;ine&s;s into Que&s;tion before the World.</HI> Ano|ther
Time he told us, <HI>That it was very good,
that we &s;hould proceed with great Warine&s;s in
this Cau&s;e; for,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>the World looketh on
us what we do; and there were not more Eyes
upon the Earl's Father lo&s;ing his Head, than
there be upon the Earl now lo&s;ing his Wife.</HI> He
told me afterwards, <HI>That he had ill Will for
tho&s;e Speeches, and complain'd that &s;ome among
us did tell Tales of all that was &s;aid and done.</HI>
(And &s;o it appear'd afterwards, that Sir <HI>J.
Cae&s;ar,</HI> and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> did.) Sir <HI>Thomas
Parry,</HI> in all his Speeches, privately mur|mur'd
again&s;t this Nullity, till he came
to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; where, the Day that the
King heard us, the Lord Chamberlain,
in my Pre&s;ence, &s;pake privately with him
and Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> about this Matter;
<PB N="8" REF="14">
and from that Time forward, Mr. Chan|cellor
of the <HI>Dutchy</HI> was alter'd. My Lord
of <HI>Ely,</HI> al&s;o, for a great while, was in Di&s;|like
of the Separation, (as I have credibly
heard he open'd him&s;elf to Sir <HI>Henry Savile</HI>)
until &s;uch Time as the King &s;pake with
him, and then his Judgment was reform'd.
But Truth it is, that among us he &s;aid no|thing.</P>
<P>Now the Earl's An&s;wer is taken, which
appeareth. In it there were divers Things
very ob&s;ervable. He us'd no ill Speech of
his Lady, for which we all much commen|ded
him. I gave him &s;o &s;trict a Charge to
&s;peak the Truth, requiring him, as he
would an&s;wer me before God at the la&s;t
Day, to deliver nothing for Favour or Af|fection,
but to inform us in the Verity,
that it wrung from him &s;omething which I
&s;uppos'd he intended not to &s;peak &s;o plain|ly.
He gave the Rea&s;on of his having no
Motions to know his Lady carnally, and of
his thinking that he never &s;hould. <HI>When
I came out of</HI> France <HI>I lov'd her; I do not &s;o
now, neither ever &s;hall I.</HI> When he was to
an&s;wer to the Article, that &s;he was <HI>Virgo
incorrupta</HI>; he &s;mil'd, and &s;aid, <HI>She &s;aith &s;o,
and &s;he is &s;o for me.</HI> Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> catch'd
the&s;e Words, and bid the Regi&s;ter &s;et down
then, <HI>credit articulum e&s;&s;e verum.</HI> The&s;e
Things gave me no great Encouragement
to the Bu&s;ine&s;s; but yet being at very lit|tle
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Lei&s;ure, I let Matters go on, and in
mine own Part re&s;olv'd nothing. Then
the Witne&s;&s;es were depos'd, but not pub|li&s;h'd.
The In&s;pectre&s;&s;es were cho&s;en, who
came mo&s;t unwillingly unto it, and how&s;o|ever
Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI>
(whom we never &s;u&s;pected to be as Parties
in the Cau&s;e, as afterwards they appear'd
to be) made all clear and fair Weather;
yet my Lord of <HI>London</HI> told us openly,
<HI>That he being with them, found that the Ladies
knew not well what to make of it; that they had
no Skill, nor knew not what was the Truth;
but what they &s;aid, was upon the Credit of the
Midwives, which were but two, and I knew not
how tamper'd with.</HI> Then came the Lady
<HI>Francis,</HI> to take her Oath, with the &s;even
Compurgators. I noted therein &s;ome
Things. A Paper was brought, containing
<HI>Verbis praeci&s;is,</HI> what her Lady&s;hip would
&s;wear. We &s;aw it, and con&s;ider'd it, and
found it too bare and &s;light to enforce any
thing. The Commi&s;&s;ioners advis'd, that
it &s;hould be more full. Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> accor|dingly
drew it; but he mu&s;t go forth to
the Lady, to know whether &s;he would
&s;wear it. At la&s;t it was agreed unto.
When &s;he came to &s;ub&s;cribe it, after the
Oath taken, one or two of her Brothers
&s;tanding at her Back, put her in Mind,
that &s;he mu&s;t not write her Name <HI>Francis
E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which &s;he mo&s;t willingly remem|ber'd,
<PB N="10" REF="16">
and &s;ub&s;crib'd <HI>Francis Howard.</HI> We
&s;aw my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI>'s Wife to be one
of the &s;even. We were afterwards inform'd
very credibly, That the Lady <HI>Knevet</HI> had
declar'd her Sorrow, that &s;he was us'd in
&s;uch an Action, and &s;aid, <HI>That &s;he wept all
the Day about it.</HI> The&s;e Things pleas'd me
little, that Nobody took Comfort in the
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Things go on in a Cour&s;e 'till <HI>Mid&s;ummer-Day.</HI>
Then did the King deal with me
privately, as if he had receiv'd divers
Complaints again&s;t me. The fir&s;t was,
<HI>That we delay'd the Proceeding, in as much as
the Meeting was put off, from the</HI> 18<HI>th of</HI>
June<HI>, 'till the</HI> 2<HI>d or</HI> 3<HI>d of</HI> July. My An|&s;wer
was, <HI>We had rather gone too fa&s;t: We
had &s;ate Forenoon and Afternoon: The Term
now grew to an End, and we had many Bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es
to di&s;patch of the King's: That the Com|mi&s;&s;ion-Day
for Cau&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tical was put off
for a Week, by Rea&s;on of</HI> Mid&s;ummer-Day
<HI>falling on a</HI> Thur&s;day<HI>; and con&s;equently, that
our Proceeding in this Cau&s;e, which commonly
attended the other Commi&s;&s;ion, was of Nece&s;&s;ity
to be defer'd.</HI> But my principal An&s;wer
was, <HI>That we could not &s;horten it; for the
Council on both Parts, bad agreed upon that
Day in</HI> July<HI>, and &s;o it was upon the Acts:
How&s;oever, therefore, the Council for my La|dy
mov'd openly in Court to abreviate the Time,
yet the Council for my Lord would not renounce</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="17">
<HI>nor alter their Term probatory, but kept them
clo&s;e unto it.</HI> Another Objection was, <HI>That
I acquainted not the King, from Time to Time,
how Matters did go.</HI> I an&s;wer'd, <HI>That I
knew not my &s;elf; for as yet there was no
Publication of Witne&s;&s;es. When any thing
came to my Knowledge, his Maje&s;ty &s;hould un|der&s;tand
it.</HI> It was added, <HI>That divers Per|&s;ons
repair'd unto me, who wi&s;h'd not well to the
Bu&s;ine&s;s. Belike,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>they mean the Earl
of</HI> Southampton<HI>, who came in the other Day,
when we were all &s;itting together. But his Coming,
was about</HI> John Cotton'<HI>s Cau&s;e; and I never
had a Word with him in all my Life, touching
this Bu&s;ine&s;s. No,</HI> &s;aid the King, and &s;mil'd,
<HI>it is Sir</HI> Henry Nevile. <HI>Indeed,</HI> quoth I,
<HI>he was with me the other Day, and this very
Morning: But your Maje&s;ty well knows what
was the Rea&s;on. It was touching that Cau&s;e,
which your Maje&s;ty commanded me to &s;end for
him about. I deliver'd him your Mind the one
Day, and he gave me an An&s;wer the other.</HI>
At this Time, his Maje&s;ty ca&s;t out &s;ome
Words, as if he wi&s;h'd well to the Nullity;
but it was &s;o ob&s;curely, that I did not
conceive that earne&s;tly he de&s;ir'd it. Af|ter
this Day, the Complaints were many
which were made to the King again&s;t me,
and many Threats were us'd, and divers
Tricks were play'd, to urge me to yield to
the Nullity. One was, <HI>That I &s;hould &s;uffer
the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>to go out of Town.</HI> I an|&s;wer'd,
<PB N="12" REF="18">
<HI>He had made his An&s;wer, and had his
Proctor, and it was our Cu&s;tom then not to &s;tay
Men.</HI> His Maje&s;ty commanded me to en|quire,
if his Pre&s;ence were not nece&s;&s;ary;
and if it were, then I &s;hould &s;tay him. I
&s;ent to Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
and to Dr. <HI>Steward</HI>; and they all agreed,
that there was no need of his Lord&s;hip's be|ing
in Town. And of this I &s;ent Word to
the Lord Chamberlain, and my Lord of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was permitted to depart. One while
it was given out, that I was mov'd by the
Queen to cro&s;s them; when, in Truth, I had
not &s;poke with her thereabout: Another
while, that I had &s;poke with the Earl of <HI>E&s;|&s;ex</HI>
at fir&s;t, and hence his Lord&s;hip grew le&s;s
pliable; when they knew what about it
was, and were told of it before. And it
was not forgotten, that when I gave Charge
to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to an&s;wer truly to the
Po&s;itions in the Libel, I nam'd the Ca&s;e of
my Lord of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and the Lady <HI>Rich,</HI>
as if I had compar'd this Cau&s;e unto theirs.
When afterwards the Earl's Council took
Exception to the Libel, it was given out,
that they were animated by me to oppo&s;e;
whereas I never &s;pake with them, nor
knew any thing of their Purpo&s;e. And
ever that was one, that there were Delays
us'd. Yea, it was to my Face deliver'd as
a Threat, that Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Grindall</HI> had
been overthrown for not giving Con&s;ent to
<PB N="13" REF="19">
the Divorce of Dr. <HI>Julio,</HI> as implying, that
the &s;ame would be my Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>About this Time, the Lords, and the
re&s;t of the Feofees, were to meet at Mr. <HI>Sut|ton</HI>'s
Ho&s;pital, about the Settling of it.
The Day that we were to come thither,
my Lord Chamberlain in the Privy-Galle|ry
at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> &s;hew'd his Anger towards
me, that we had not &s;ent for the Keys to
his Lord&s;hip, and that he might deliver
over the Cau&s;e. But when I came to the
<HI>Charter-hou&s;e,</HI> there was deliver'd me a Let|ter,
written all with my Lord's own Hand,
and directed to the Lord Arch-Bi&s;hop, the
Lord Chancellor, and the Lord Privy-Seal;
wherein he did twice take Exception to me
by Name, and, in a Sort, brav'd me, that
&s;o he might pick a Quarrel to me; where|unto
I reply'd not, but bore it with Pa|tience.</P>
<P>A little before <HI>Whit&s;ontide,</HI> his Lord&s;hip
was very kind to me, and of his own Ac|cord
proffer'd me a Chamber at <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
which my Lord, my Predece&s;&s;or, had; but
after twice Proffering of it, and my Ac|cepting
of the &s;ame, his Lord&s;hip fell off
&s;trangely, and I never &s;pake of it more.
The&s;e Complaints and Threats made me to
&s;u&s;pect all was not well; for what needed
the&s;e Things to me, in a Matter of Ju|&s;tice?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">
The Time now grew on, that his Ma|je&s;ty
was to go abroad in Progre&s;s on a
<HI>Sunday,</HI> which was the Day before the
Council for my Lord, were to put in their
An&s;wers and Exceptions to the Libel.
The Lord Privy Seal &s;hew'd me a Letter
of the King's to his Lord&s;hip, wherein he
was to expo&s;tulate with me, for delaying
the Bu&s;ine&s;s. I gave his Lord&s;hip An&s;wer
what was done, and he profe&s;s'd that his
Lord&s;hip was &s;atisfy'd, and that no Man
could do more than I did. On the <HI>Mon|day,</HI>
the Council for my Lord, put in their
An&s;wer, which was round and picquant.
The Lord Chamberlain had Notice of it,
and complain'd thereof to the King. I
&s;ent his Maje&s;ty the Copy thereof, and
receiv'd from the King a Letter, written
all with his Maje&s;ty's own Hand, &s;hew|ing
Di&s;like thereof. At that Time, Sir
<HI>William Button</HI> threaten'd Sir <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Ser|vant
hard for that An&s;wer, as the &s;aid
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> divers Weeks after told me.
The Commi&s;&s;ioners con&s;ider'd of the. An|&s;wer,
and di&s;allow'd it, giving Order, that
no Record &s;hould remain of it, but that
it &s;hould be utterly defac'd. This was
very well accepted, and now my Lord of
<HI>Canterbury</HI> was a very hone&s;t Man. But
'till this was done, their Followers gave
out, that the King had in two Letters
<PB N="15" REF="21">
&s;o &s;chool'd the Arch-bi&s;hop, as he was
never &s;chool'd in all his Life.</P>
<P>Things now being quiet, I call'd Sir
<HI>William Button</HI> one Commi&s;&s;ion-Day unto
me, and &s;pake thus to him: <HI>Sir</HI> William
Button, <HI>you have follow'd this Bu&s;ine&s;s from
the fir&s;t, and have been pre&s;ent at the acting
of all Things. Have you ever &s;een me, in
Word or Deed, done any Matter that doth
not become me?</HI> (for indeed hitherto I had
no Way declar'd my &s;elf, becau&s;e we were
not come to con&s;ider of the Proofs.) <HI>What is
then the Cau&s;e that I am thus complain'd upon,
that I cannot one Day be quiet?</HI> His An|&s;wer
unto me, was, <HI>That the Lord</HI> Cham|berlain
<HI>was every way a kind Father to his
Children, but in this of his Daughter, he was
&s;o Pa&s;&s;ionate, 'till it had an End, that he lay
as on a Grid-iron, broiling 'till the Matter
were accompli&s;h'd.</HI> Quoth I, <HI>It &s;hall not be
delay'd by me.</HI> Now, the Council on both
Sides grew on to inform us, wherein I
noted, that whereas the Libel was laid
in Nature of <HI>Maleficium ver&s;us hanc,</HI> my
Lady's Council upon the &s;hutting up of
the Cau&s;e, would not apply them&s;elves
thereunto, neither would they willingly
hear of it; which &s;eem'd &s;trange, &s;ince
all the Books which they brought,
particularly to the Cau&s;e, did mention
that; and Doctor <HI>Steward</HI> had publickly
and expre&s;&s;ively &s;aid, <HI>That it was that</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="22">
<HI>which they did mean.</HI> This troubl'd me
&s;omewhat, becau&s;e I perceiv'd that they
them&s;elves could not tell what to make
of it. But afterwards fell out another
Matter, which very much alienated my
Judgment from the Cau&s;e: It appear'd,
that Sentence could not be given, 'till
the Time that the King entring his Pro|gre&s;s,
was gone as far as <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and then
his Maje&s;ty was &s;oon to depart to <HI>Far|nam.</HI>
Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> told us, <HI>That he was
to attend the King in Progre&s;s; that he mu&s;t
be at</HI> Farnam<HI>; that he was Old and Lame;
that it would be too great a Trouble for him,
to come back again at the Day of Sentence.</HI>
He therefore pray'd, <HI>That we would hear
him deliver his Judgment of the whole Matter.</HI>
This Proffer &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d wondrous &s;trange to
mo&s;t of us, and putting it by hand&s;ome|ly,
we re&s;olv'd not to trouble him there|with:
And in this Opinion we aro&s;e. But
afterwards my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> cometh to
my Study Door, where I and my Lord
of <HI>London</HI> were about another Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and telleth us, That my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> and
Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, were
very de&s;irous to hear Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;peak;
and that he, for his Part, was of the Mind
that it would do very well, and therefore
he importun'd us both to give Con&s;ent
unto it; we imagining no great harm
could come thereby, a&s;&s;ented, and the next
<PB N="17" REF="23">
Day is appointed for that Purpo&s;e. There
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> cometh with a formal Decla|ration,
divided into &s;ix Parts, to every
one of which, he &s;pake &s;o largely, that
with a little replying of ours, it &s;pent
a whole Afternoon. Matters which I mo&s;t
ob&s;erv'd therein, were the&s;e: He told us,
<HI>That by our Commi&s;&s;ion, we might hear this
Cau&s;e &s;ummarily.</HI> He brought a Book, <HI>That
he who hath Power to hear a Matter &s;um|marily,
is in Nature of an Arbiter cho&s;en by
both Parties, and therefore may judge in Di&s;|cretion,
as he &s;hall think fit;</HI> and more to
that Purpo&s;e. I thought with my &s;elf,
that this was &s;trange Doctrine in a Mat|ter
of Marriage; that as Arbitrators, we
might adjudge a Wife to her Hu&s;band,
or not adjudge her, according to our Di&s;|cretion.
In his di&s;cour&s;ing of my Lord's
Impotency, <HI>Ver&s;us hanc,</HI> he beat upon the
Matter of <HI>Maleficium,</HI> and yet by no Means
he would have it to be that apparently.
He in&s;i&s;ted much, <HI>That the Sentence was to
be given in General Terms, not naming any
particular Impotency.</HI> I told him, <HI>In &s;uch
a Sentence, the World look that we &s;hould yeild
a Rea&s;on of that which we did.</HI> He reply'd,
<HI>That it was fit to give no Rea&s;on. And
here,</HI> &s;aid Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer,
<HI>a Judge is not to give a Rea&s;on of his Sen|tence,
but only to God. I would give no Rea|&s;on
to any Prince in the World.</HI> I was once
<PB N="18" REF="24">
call'd before Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> about a Sen|tence
which I gave, and &s;he demanded
of me the Rea&s;on thereof; I told her,
<HI>A Judge was bound to give no Rea&s;on of
that which he pronounc'd, but only to God.</HI>
I marvell'd much at the&s;e Things, and
at la&s;t reply'd, <HI>Well, let it be, we acquaint
not the World with the Rea&s;on of that which
we do, yet is it not fit, that I who am the
Judge, and mu&s;t pronounce the Sentence, know
the Ground of that which I am to pronounce.</HI>
Here, after a little pau&s;ing, one of them
&s;aid, <HI>Yes, for you may &s;ee that in the Books
and Depo&s;itions.</HI> Quoth I, <HI>But I cannot &s;ee
that there which may &s;atisfy me. But Mr.
Chancellor &s;aid, I, and Sir</HI> Daniel Dun<HI>, Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
you perhaps be not driven to it,
yet I &s;hall be forc'd of Nece&s;&s;ity to tell Men
the Rea&s;on of the Sentence: For as &s;oon as
this Cau&s;e is &s;entenc'd, every Man who is di&s;|contented
with his Wi&s;e, and every Woman
di&s;contented with her Hu&s;band, which can have
any rea&s;onable Pretence, will repair to me for
&s;uch Nullities. If I yeild unto them, here will
be &s;trange Violations of Marriages; if I do
not, I must not tell them, that it was fit for
my Lord of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>, but it is not &s;o for you;
for the Law knoweth no, Per&s;ons, but is in|different
to all. If I then repel them, I mu&s;t
&s;hew a Rea&s;on: Your Ca&s;e is not like that of
my Lord of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>; for his Ca&s;e was thus,
yours is thus. And &s;o mu&s;t I deliver the</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="25">
<HI>Rea&s;on, or Men will not be an&s;wer'd.</HI> In
this Time of debating, I ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d Sir <HI>Daniel
Dun, I pray you Ma&s;ter of the Reque&s;ts, what
Examples have we of any Nullity in</HI> England<HI>,
pronounc'd in this kind? Might a Man &s;ee
any Precedent of it? For I would be loath
to do a thing, that never was done before.
Yes,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>there be Precedents thereof.
In</HI> Anne <HI>of</HI> Cleve's <HI>Ca&s;e, we have an Ex|ample,
and another in one</HI> Berry<HI>, which I
have here in my Book</HI>; and thereupon out
of a Note-Book of his own, he read now
a Line or two, and then two or three
other Lines in another Place, and &s;o
forward. My An&s;wer was, <HI>I did not think
that King</HI> Henry'<HI>s Separation from</HI> Anne
<HI>of</HI> Cleve<HI>, was for any &s;uch Matter, but up|on
a Precontract.</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>King</HI> Henry <HI>the</HI>
VIIIth <HI>was a &s;trange Prince in that kind:
He put him&s;elf into many Marriages; and when
he began that with</HI> Anne <HI>of</HI> Cleve<HI>, he
fear'd lea&s;t the Emperor, and King of</HI> France<HI>,
&s;hould combine with the Pope again&s;t him,
and therefore he was de&s;irous to &s;trengthen
him&s;elf with the Prote&s;tant Princes in</HI> Ger|many<HI>;
and for that he thought this Mar|riage
was much behoveful. But afterwards
growing into Peace, with one or both of tho&s;e
Princes, he grew &s;oon weary of the Mar|riage,
becau&s;e he lik'd not the Woman.</HI> But
then I promis'd to con&s;ider further of the&s;e
two Ca&s;es. This was the End of that
<PB N="20" REF="26">
Day's Labour, which, when at Night I
had recounted with my &s;elf, I thought it
was an audacious Part, for &s;uch a one as
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> was, to teach us out of &s;uch
poor Grounds, both what to do, and how
to do. I found by my Ob&s;ervation, that
it was a &s;et Match, that thus he &s;hould
be heard; that he was prepar'd for the
Purpo&s;e: For no Man upon the &s;udden,
or one Day's warning, could deliver &s;o
much, and &s;o dige&s;ted. And now I began
to a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf, that he did not &s;hew
him&s;elf a Judge, but was a Stickler for
the Nullity. I much &s;u&s;pected the Con|&s;cience
of the Man, knowing him rea&s;o|nably
well before, both out of mine own
E&s;timation of him, and out of the Judg|ment
of my two Predece&s;&s;ors, the Lords
<HI>Whitgift</HI> and <HI>Bancroft,</HI> who held him for
a Man mo&s;t corrupt. Yet the next Day
I &s;ent unto him for his Note-Book, and
I caus'd the Record of <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Cleve,</HI> to
be brought unto me. Reading over all the
latter, I found not one Word tending to
the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. <HI>Good Lord! thought I,
how doth this Man deceive me!</HI> Peru&s;ing
his own Book for that of <HI>Berry,</HI> I found
it to be nothing but the Pleadings of
Advocates on both Sides, when about the
40 of <HI>Eliz.</HI> there was &s;ome Que&s;tion in
the Common Law Courts, about <HI>Berry</HI>'s
Land, <HI>Berry</HI> him&s;elf being dead many
<PB N="21" REF="27">
Years before. But I &s;aw more in this
Book again&s;t the Cau&s;e now in hand,
than for it; and by &s;ome other Writings
in my Hou&s;e, I di&s;cover'd that <HI>Berry</HI>'s
Divorce, <HI>Anno</HI> 1561, was for want of
his Stones, which Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> al&s;o,
being now of Council for my Lady, and
who formerly &s;tood for <HI>Berry</HI>'s Bro|ther
again&s;t the &s;uppos'd Son, publickly
acknowledg'd. The&s;e Things made me
in my Heart much di&s;like the Cau&s;e, and
procur'd in me a hard Opinion, touching
Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> who &s;hould not have wrong'd
me, being my Officer, as Dean of the
<HI>Arches.</HI></P>
<P>Within few Days after, the Me&s;&s;age
cometh to us, that we were all to attend
the King at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> This accordingly
was done. The Morning before the Hear|ing,
the Lord Chamberlain in my Pre&s;ence,
&s;poke fir&s;t earne&s;tly with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and afterward with the
Chancellor of the Dutchy, who that Day
fell from us, as appear'd by the few Words
that he had before the King. Some few
Days before that, had Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
by Sir <HI>William Button,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI>
been otherwi&s;e dealt withal, earne&s;tly
to give Con&s;ent to the Nullity; but that
Day we dealt in it more than three Hours.
His Maje&s;ty propounding the Matter,
ask'd, <HI>How Things did &s;tand?</HI> Sir <HI>Ju|lius</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="28">
<HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aid, <HI>That Sir</HI> Daniel Dun <HI>was
be&s;t able to &s;peak unto it.</HI> And then, <HI>ex
compo&s;ito,</HI> Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> begins, and tells a great
Tale, and e&s;pecially in&s;i&s;teth upon <HI>Non
potnit.</HI> When he had done, I an&s;wer'd
him, and &s;hew'd the want of Ground for
that Conclu&s;ion, out of other the Earl's
evident An&s;wers, <HI>That the</HI> Non potuit <HI>was
for lack of Love, and not for want of Abi|lity.</HI>
I challeng'd Sir <HI>Daniel,</HI> for abu&s;ing
the King with a fal&s;e Report, and e&s;pe|cially
for his two Precedents of <HI>Berry</HI>'s
Ca&s;e, and that of <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Cleve.</HI> Among&s;t
us, was divers ways &s;hew'd the In&s;uffici|ency
of the Proofs; that the Libel was
laid &s;hort of the Cau&s;e, and the Proofs
were &s;hort of the Libel: That we had
very many Times call'd upon the Council
for my Lady, that they &s;hould look that
they rightly laid their Matter, and made
their Proof &s;trong; that in the End, they
complain'd not of the Judges, when the
Fault was in them&s;elves: (Where my
Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> added, <HI>That him&s;elf fear|ing
the wor&s;t, had gone to the</HI> Doctors-Com|mons,
<HI>and warn'd the Council for my Lady,
that they &s;hould look to it.</HI>) Among other
Things there utter'd, Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> &s;aid,
<HI>What a Di&s;grace will this be to my Lord
Chamberlain and his Daughter, if it &s;hould
not now go forward?</HI> My An&s;wer was,
<HI>They &s;hould have look'd to that before they</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="29">
<HI>did begin it: We were not the Men that &s;et
the Matter on Foot; if it were a Di&s;grace,
they put it on them&s;elves. But,</HI> quoth I,
<HI>mu&s;t I, to &s;ave any Man from Di&s;grace,
&s;end my Soul unto Hell, to give a Sentence
whereof, I &s;aw no Ground? I will never do
it.</HI> My Lord of <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> did carry them&s;elves well
that Day, altho' Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> had much
Oppo&s;ition from the King him&s;elf. When
we &s;aw the King earne&s;t, I fell down on
my Knee, and with Tears in mine Eyes,
I &s;aid, <HI>I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty, if ever I
have done you any Service, whom I do &s;erve
with a faithful Heart, or may do you any
Service, rid me of this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> I had &s;aid
before, <HI>That I was the unfitte&s;t Man that
might be, to judge of &s;uch a Cau&s;e; I was
no marry'd Man, I was no Lawyer, and
I had not had the Time, by rea&s;on of my in|finite
Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, to read &s;o much of that Mat|ter,
as other Men had.</HI> I ob&s;erv'd that Day,
many Things in his Maje&s;ty's Carriage,
of the Matter: He was Earne&s;t, but Gra|cious
and Moderate. He found Fault with
the Libel, and &s;aid, <HI>That Complaints were
made, that we went too &s;low, but he per|ceiv'd
we went too fa&s;t.</HI> He marvell'd that
my Lord of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Knowles,</HI>
were not examin'd as Witne&s;&s;es. He con|&s;tantly
profe&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, <HI>That he believ'd that my
Lord of</HI> E&s;&s;ex, <HI>was Impotent for a Woman.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="30">
He told us, <HI>That &s;ome of the Earl's Friends
had put a Woman to him, and he would not
touch her.</HI> His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, <HI>That the Earl
was once purpos'd to have gone to</HI> Poland,
<HI>to have try'd whither he might be unwitched.</HI>
To which Things my Reply was, <HI>I would
to God we might &s;ee the&s;e Things legally
prov'd. That his Maje&s;ty much di&s;lik'd that
Cour&s;e, and therefore he &s;et the Cour&s;e now in
Pro&s;ecution; and therefore if there were any
Error in it, he had done the Lord</HI> Cham|berlain
<HI>wrong, and he mu&s;t take it upon him.</HI>
In &s;um, I found his Maje&s;ty much troubled
what to do, as I gather'd, e&s;pecially by
the&s;e Words, If my Lord of <HI>Canterbury,</HI>
and my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> have a Negative
Voice, we mu&s;t either begin all again,
and have a new Libel, or we mu&s;t have
a new Commi&s;&s;ion, and put other Ad|juncts.
The Conclu&s;ion from his Ma|je&s;ty
was, That we &s;hould all meet at
<HI>Lambeth</HI> on the Morrow, and if we could
unanimou&s;ly con&s;ent, then go to the Sen|tence;
if not, we &s;hould put it off unto
another Day, and certify him of it, and
&s;o farther under&s;tand his Plea&s;ure. When
the King was ri&s;en from his Chair, he
fell to inveighing again&s;t the&s;e Marry|ings
of young Couples, before they be
acquainted one with another. He told us
the Inconvenience of it, how he knew in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> a Father who marry'd his only
<PB N="25" REF="31">
Child to a Man again&s;t her Will: That
&s;he with&s;tood it; yet her Father forc'd her
to marry him: That being gone Home
with her Hu&s;band after a very few Days, &s;he
came run away from him: That her Fa|ther
jerk'd her, and &s;ent her home again:
That not long after, &s;he poy&s;on'd her
Hu&s;band, and was burnt for it, while the
King was in <HI>Scotland.</HI> After his Maje&s;ty's
going out, I follow'd him, and told him,
I evidently perceiv'd, that it was in the
Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex Vitium Animi non Corporis.</HI>
His Maje&s;ty &s;wore he thought &s;o. There
pa&s;s'd &s;ome other Speech from the King to
me, touching his own Lying with the
Queen the fir&s;t Night that he marry'd her.
But, at the la&s;t, I ki&s;s'd his Hand and de|parted.
After I was gone, the Lord Cham|berlain
&s;peaking &s;omewhat again&s;t me, the
King reply'd, <HI>The Arch-bi&s;hop hath &s;o adjur'd
me to be rid of this Matter, that I cannot tell
what to &s;ay to him.</HI> This did Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>
tell me that Day at Dinner, at <HI>Eaton
College,</HI> letting me know, that the King
found no Fault with me. But afterward,
the King coming to Dinner, after his
Meat had &s;tay'd for him on the Table
more than a Quarter of an Hour, he &s;ate
him down in his Chair, and ca&s;ting his
Leg over one Side of it, he eat no Meat
for a great Space of Time, neither &s;aid he
any Word, but &s;ate mu&s;ing to him&s;elf;
<PB N="26" REF="32">
which every Man ob&s;erv'd. And it was
given out by &s;ome in the Court, that I
was gone away in the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure.
Within &s;ome few Days after, it was al&s;o
more Ways than one brought credibly to
my Ears, That the Arch-bi&s;hop and my Lord
of <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould be hereafter kept to
their Spiritualities, and &s;hould meddle no
more in temporal Matters: And within a
while it came &s;o far, as that they &s;hould
have their Temporalities taken from them.
Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> was at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> mov'd by
Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> in the Lord <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Name,
and afterwards by the Lord <HI>Fenton</HI> him&s;elf,
That he &s;hould alter his Opinion, and
make his Peace with the King, for his Ma|je&s;ty
was not well pleas'd with him.</P>
<P>As I came Homeward from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> in
my Coach, and all that &s;ame Night, two
Things did run much in my Mind; the
one of them was, What a &s;trange and fear|ful
Thing it was, That his Maje&s;ty &s;hould
be &s;o far engag'd in that Bu&s;ine&s;s: That
he &s;hould profe&s;s, that him&s;elf had &s;et the
Matter in that Cour&s;e of Judgment: That
the Judges &s;hould be dealt withal before,
and, in a Sort, directed what they &s;hould
determine: That the like Example had
not been &s;een: That his Maje&s;ty did win
him&s;elf much Honour in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Sut|ton</HI>'s
Ho&s;pital, that, notwith&s;tanding all
Importunity, he had &s;uffer'd the Judges to
<PB N="27" REF="33">
do their Con&s;cience. This &s;trange moving
to the contrary, did make me marvelou&s;ly
&s;u&s;pect that it was no direct Matter;
and, as a dutiful Servant to my mo&s;t gra|cious
Ma&s;ter, I wi&s;h'd in my Heart, that
his Maje&s;ty's Hand might be taken off the
Bu&s;ine&s;s. The other Point was, That we
had all this while, in our Debatings, never,
or very little, meddled with Points of Di|vinity.
And I thought with my &s;elf, that
much might be &s;aid therein, again&s;t <HI>malefi|cium,</HI>
and the Nullity to be pronounc'd
thereupon <HI>ver&s;us hanc</HI>; for out of this we
could never get in all our Talking, though
they would never cleave fa&s;t to it. I
therefore, having formerly revolv'd &s;ome
&s;uch Things in my Mind, ro&s;e early on
the Day that we were to debate Things at
large, and &s;et down my Mind in writing
out of &s;omething in Divinity. The Copy
of this appeareth. The Day after we
came from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> being <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> we met,
and all the Forenoon we in&s;i&s;ted on that
which I had briefly written: But to deli|ver
my Con&s;cience freely before God, I re|ceiv'd
no kind or &s;hew of Satisfaction. My
Lord of <HI>Ely</HI> &s;ate little le&s;s than Dumb, as
if he had never dream'd of any &s;uch Mat|ter.
Divers of the Commi&s;&s;ioners wonder'd
at him, that he, who had &s;pent &s;o much
Time in reading of the Canoni&s;ts touching
this Que&s;tion, &s;hould not think upon Divi|nity.
<PB N="28" REF="34">
Briefly up and down by others &s;ome|what
was &s;aid, but nothing to Content|ment.
After Dinner, Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> pro|pounded
Rea&s;ons out of the Law, but
without any Satisfaction. I ob&s;erv'd two
&s;pecial Points that Afternoon: The one
was, That we all thought my Lord of <HI>E&s;|&s;ex</HI>
his An&s;wer to the Libel, was neither
plain nor &s;ufficient. And now it was re|member'd,
that my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> had
put to him certain Que&s;tions, that four
Things were nece&s;&s;ary to Generation; <HI>Mem|brum
virile,</HI> Erection, Penetration, and <HI>Eja|culatio
Seminis</HI>; which, altho' they were
then &s;mil'd at, and &s;ince that Time much
Sport had been made at the Court and in
<HI>London</HI> about them; yet now our marry'd
Men on all Hands wi&s;h'd that punctually
his Lord&s;hip might have been held to give
his An&s;wer unto them. This in&s;tructed
me, that the Proofs were not full. A &s;e|cond
Thing was, that when towards the
Evening, I wi&s;h'd that a Reconciliation
might be labour'd between my Lord and
my Lady, that it &s;hould be&s;t become us,
my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> who from the fir&s;t Beginning
of the Proce&s;s, had been always very &s;ilent,
&s;pake home about that, much di&s;liking
that any &s;uch Thing &s;hould now be &s;ought;
that it was too late; that it might be the
Cau&s;e of poy&s;oning and de&s;troying one of
another, to bring them together again.
<PB N="29" REF="35">
Well, when we could not agree upon our
Conclu&s;ion, we were inforc'd to put all off
unto a longer Day; and as the King com|manded,
I was to certify his Maje&s;ty of it.
I wrote a Letter to the King, praying hum|bly
that I might be freed from the Trouble
of this Cau&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, give no Sen|tence
in it, 'till I were a marry'd Man,
and &s;o might better under&s;tand the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
I inclo&s;'d al&s;o &s;ix Rea&s;ons of Sir
<HI>John Bennet</HI>'s taking Exceptions in Law
again&s;t the Nullity. And withal I joyn'd
mine own Rea&s;ons in Divinity, of which
I &s;aid in my Letter, that I knew not where
to &s;eek an An&s;wer to them; meaning,
that the Commi&s;&s;ioners had given me none.
The&s;e Rea&s;ons afterwards co&s;t me a great
deal of Trouble.</P>
<P>The next Progre&s;s in this Controver&s;y,
was, that I was advertis'd, that it was his
Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure that the Cau&s;e &s;hould be
put off until the 18th of <HI>September</HI>; and
withal there was brought a new Commi&s;|&s;ion
of Adjuncts, whereinto my Lords of
<HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> were put. The
Day that I perceiv'd this, acquainting
the two Chancellors of the Exchequer and
Dutchy therewith, in the Gallery at
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> I told them, <HI>That I hoped now, that
for my Part, I &s;hould be freed from any Trouble
therein farther, for I did de&s;ire to be rid of it.</HI>
They both an&s;wer'd me, <HI>That they de&s;ir'd in</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="36">
<HI>like &s;ort to be quit of the Matter.</HI> A good
Bu&s;ine&s;s, thought I, that no Body taketh
Comfort of it, unle&s;s it be Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI>
of whom I forgot before to note, that on
the Day of meeting, next after our coming
from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> he, with a great deal of In|&s;olency,
challeng'd me for my Speech be|fore
his Maje&s;ty, the Day before. <HI>Do not
abu&s;e the King, Sir</HI> Daniel Dun. I remem|ber'd
it was in mine own Hou&s;e, and if I
had rattl'd him according to his De&s;erts,
my Lord Chamberlain would have &s;aid it
had been done for his Sake; and in the Pro|gre&s;s,
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> having the King's Ear,
would have made Things wor&s;e than they
were; and I therefore forbore him with &s;uch
Patience, that &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners
told me afterwards, that they wonder'd
how I could endure tho&s;e Behaviours, at
the Hands of a Man of his Quality: But
yet they commended me for it. Now grew
I to con&s;ider what were the Rea&s;ons why
the&s;e two Commi&s;&s;ioners were joined to us;
and therein I had many Adverti&s;ements
from divers Friends, divers Ways. We re|&s;olv'd
for my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI>; that it was
&s;uppos'd, that there was no great Amity
between him and me; that when I was
Dean there, there was &s;ome Di&s;agreement
between us, which they &s;uppos'd yet con|tinu'd:
That he had an old Grudge to me,
for having the Archbi&s;hoprick, which his
<PB N="31" REF="37">
Lord&s;hip &s;o much de&s;ir'd. Be&s;ides, it was
&s;ome Tickling unto him, that his Gravity
and Learning &s;hould either win in the
Arch-bi&s;hop, or lay &s;ome Blemi&s;h upon
him, if he &s;tood out. Certain it is, that
Sir <HI>William Button</HI> was with him; and,
doubtle&s;s, would tell him how acceptable
this Service would be to his Maje&s;ty. I
heard of good Credit and &s;ecretly, That he
was put in hope to be made a Privy-Coun|&s;ellor;
and the Fame was general, That
for the Father's Labour, the Son &s;hould be
made a Knight. It &s;eemeth at the fir&s;t,
that he had no great Fancy unto it; but
being wrought upon, he con&s;ented; &s;o that
he might be required by his Maje&s;ty to be
pre&s;ent. This was done by a Letter from
<HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> which, at his being at <HI>Lambeth,</HI>
he &s;hew'd me; that I &s;hould take Notice,
that he had not come, unle&s;s he had been
commanded. I leave him for the Time,
only &s;ignifying, that in the Vacation, he
&s;ent for divers Books from <HI>London,</HI> and had
Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> much with him, to inform him
in all Particulars. Yet I may not forget,
that while he held off his Con&s;ent, &s;ome
hard Opinions were rais'd of him at Court;
as I found by a Letter from my Lord of
<HI>Litchfield</HI> to me. For there he was found
Fault with, that he attended not the King
at <HI>Farnham,</HI> or at <HI>Andover.</HI> And there
Blame was laid, that Mr. <HI>Love,</HI> who was
<PB N="32" REF="38">
&s;o great with my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> was like
to get the Warden's Place at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Harmar</HI> being reported to be dead. Con|cerning
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> it was well
known that he had open'd him&s;elf before
the King's going in Progre&s;s, that he lik'd
well of the Nullity. Coming once or twice
while we were about it, he, with &s;ome in
my Hou&s;e di&s;puted earne&s;tly for it. He
was a great Dependant of my Lord of
<HI>Litchfield.</HI> This was a Way to make him
well e&s;teem'd, and to ari&s;e high in Prefer|ment.
But, in Truth, he &s;hould not have
verify'd the Report which Arch-bi&s;hop
<HI>Bancroft</HI> on his Death-Bed gave of him,
together with <HI>Butler</HI> and <HI>Carrier,</HI> to the
King by a Me&s;&s;age, unle&s;s he did &s;ome
&s;uch Thing. When he was put into the
Commi&s;&s;ion, he in divers Places &s;eem'd to
be much offended, that he was made one.
His Grief was, that he was &s;et in Oppo&s;i|tion
again&s;t me: He would never give his
Voice to it, unle&s;s I con&s;ented. The&s;e, and
the like Things, he &s;pake, as el&s;ewhere, &s;o
to &s;ome of my Servants in my Hou&s;e at
<HI>Croydon</HI>: For, under another Colour, he
came three Times in the Vacation to me;
but I never &s;pake a Word with him about
that Matter, as knowing it would be an
Argument again&s;t me, that I labour'd to
draw away the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners; and
the End &s;hew'd, that I had no great Rea|&s;on
<PB N="33" REF="39">
to tru&s;t him. Be&s;ides the&s;e two Ad|juncts,
the new Commi&s;&s;ion it &s;elf &s;eem'd
very &s;trange unto me. There were eight
made of the <HI>Quorum</HI>; and it was &s;o laid,
that if three of them, with two other, con|&s;ented,
the Sentence might be given; &s;o
that, by the Words thereof, if &s;even had
deny'd, five might have pronounc'd and
prevail'd. A Matter &s;o uncooth, that, as
I credibly heard, my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> him|&s;elf
found much Fault therewith. Again,
there was a Clau&s;e, <HI>Legibus, Statutis, Ordi|nationibus,
Con&s;titutionibus quibu&s;cunque non
ob&s;tantibus</HI>; &s;o re&s;olv'd they were to have it
di&s;patch'd. Every thing now &s;tood at a
Pau&s;e; and my Lord of <HI>Ely</HI> (who, at fir&s;t,
deliver'd his Judgment again&s;t it to Sir
<HI>Henry Savile,</HI> as I heard it avow'd upon
good Credit; but afterwards &s;aid, he was
better in&s;tructed by the King) began to
hearken what Men &s;aid of the Matter, as
appeared by Speech which he had with Sir
<HI>John Paiton</HI>; to whom, notwith&s;tanding,
he told &s;ome Things of the In&s;ufficiency
of my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> The Weather grew
fair; he hop'd the overflowing of the I&s;le
of <HI>Ely</HI> would cea&s;e; he would go down
in his Vi&s;itation; he came and took his
leave of me, but not one Word of the
Nullity.</P>
<P>Now was his Maje&s;ty abroad, and I had
more Lei&s;ure to con&s;ider of this Que&s;tion.
<PB N="34" REF="40">
I read what I could; I confer'd with many
Men about divers Circum&s;tances, &s;o to in|form
my &s;elf the better. I pray'd fre|quently
to God to direct me aright. I of|ten
perus'd the Depo&s;itions, but I found
little Satisfaction. I perceiv'd mo&s;t of the
Lords had a great Di&s;like of this Proceed|ing;
that the better Sort of Men had
generally a Dete&s;tation of it; that the
Judges and Lawyers much condemned it.
I heard many &s;trange Stories of the Lady's
Carriage. Something was freely &s;poken
of a Woman arraign'd at <HI>Bury</HI>; and how
to &s;hut that up, and &s;o to free the Earl,
this Cour&s;e was con&s;ented upon.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, though out of Charity I
entertain'd not as ab&s;olutely true, yet the
Concurrence of them from &s;o many, made
me that I could not contemn them. Be|&s;ides,
now grew the Rumour &s;trong, that a
new Hu&s;band was readily provided for
her: Whereof I call'd to Mind the Opi|nion
of Sir <HI>Henry Nevile,</HI> deliver'd to me
at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; and I did not forget a Speech
of <HI>Overbury</HI>'s, once to me in that Kind. I
under&s;tood, that at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> la&s;t, there
was a Reconciliation wrought between
the Earl and his Lady, how&s;oever it fell
out. Yea, that when the Lords met at
<HI>White-Hall</HI> about the Manner of Separation,
there was three Times that Day a Likeli|hood
to make them Friends; which we
<PB N="35" REF="41">
thought imply'd no Di&s;ability of my Lord
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> even in their own Opinion. I
farther under&s;tood, that whereas it was
whi&s;per'd among us, the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
That at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> la&s;t, my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
being in Bed with his Lady, &s;hould labour
a quarter of an Hour carnally to know her,
and in the End &s;hould &s;ay, Frankey, <HI>it will
not be,</HI> and &s;o ki&s;s'd her, and bid her good
Night: That this was not true; but that
the Earl, the Night before his going from
<HI>London,</HI> at the End of <HI>Trinity</HI> Term, &s;aid
with Tears in his Eyes, <HI>That when he went to
Bed to her at</HI> Chri&s;tmas <HI>la&s;t, he had forgiven
all Things as clearly as he wi&s;h'd that God
&s;hould forgive him his Sins; but when they
were alone, &s;he revil'd him, and mi&s;call'd him,
terming him Cow, and Coward, and Beast:</HI>
And he added, <HI>that &s;he was as bitter a Woman
as any was in the World: Which Things &s;o
cool'd his Courage, that he was far from know|ing,
or endeavouring to know her.</HI> The&s;e
Matters, together with the &s;mall Joy
which the Commi&s;&s;ioners had to deal in
the Bu&s;ine&s;s, made me have no great Fan|cy
unto it. On the other Side, I heard
that my Lord Chamberlain, or his Fol|lowers,
gave out, that what was done,
was perform'd by the King's Direction,
otherwi&s;e it had not been begun; and
therefore, they expected that his Maje&s;ty
&s;hould &s;ee it effected; that they re&s;ted
<PB N="36" REF="42">
them&s;elves on him. I was much griev'd
that they had this Advantage on my Ma|&s;ter,
who being &s;o engag'd, as I thought,
could not well go backward or forward:
And, to increa&s;e my Sorrow, I was private|ly
advertis'd from Court, that his Maje&s;ty
did mean him&s;elf to give an An&s;wer to my
Rea&s;ons above-mention'd. I heard ano|ther
Way, that his Maje&s;ty in the Progre&s;s
wrote much with his own Hands. From
another Friend I was told, That the King
with his An&s;wer to the Rea&s;ons, had writ|ten
to me a &s;harp Letter. Yea, by ano|ther
I learn'd the Contents of the Letter,
which was full of Sharpne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things in the Summer kept me
full of Expectation of &s;ome great Di&s;con|tentment.
Yet my heart &s;till a&s;&s;ur'd me,
that I was guilty of no Wickedne&s;s. I
found all Per&s;ons with whom I &s;pake of
my Mind, for the Di&s;like of the Nullity.
In many Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es to and from the King
by Letters, I found nothing but well.
His Maje&s;ty &s;ent me Warrants for three
Bucks, as formerly he had done, and with
&s;ome Kindne&s;s joyn'd.</P>
<P>Thus I was to&s;&s;ed in my Thoughts; and
in all my Troubles, I had Recour&s;e to God
in Prayer.</P>
<P>By this Time, the 18th of <HI>September,</HI> draw|eth
nigh, and I am inform'd, That my
Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> before, was
<PB N="37" REF="43">
come to Town; and that be&s;ides my La|dy's
Council, Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and Sir <HI>Da|niel
Dun,</HI> did, at St. <HI>Mary Overy</HI>'s Hou&s;e,
daily attend his Lord&s;hip. I expected no
great Good of this; only from the King I
heard nothing but well. For &s;ome few Days
before, his Maje&s;ty had been at <HI>White-hall,</HI>
where I ki&s;s'd his Hand, and he did not
only look merrily upon me, but he gave me
Promi&s;e of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> for my
Brother, as I under&s;tood it. Some other
Matters al&s;o pa&s;s'd quietly in Speech, and I
found no Di&s;turbance. But on the 17th of
<HI>Septemb.</HI> the Day before our new meeting at
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> being &s;ent
from the King, bringeth divers Papers un|to
me, &s;eal'd up. I open'd them, and found
there my Rea&s;ons fir&s;t, &s;econdly, an An&s;wer
to them, and, thirdly, a Letter, all writ|ten
with the King's Hand unto me. I
read them all pre&s;ently, without any
abatement, whereunto I was help'd by my
Fore-knowledge, that &s;uch Things would
come. I &s;aid little unto it, only I ask'd
my Lord of <HI>Litchfield, Whether he knew what
tho&s;e Papers contain'd?</HI> He told me, <HI>That
the King had read unto him the An&s;wers to the
Rea&s;ons, and had given him the Letter to Seal
up in a Paper; but in Reverence to his Ma|je&s;ty,
he held it not his Duty to look into it.</HI>
Growing afterward in &s;ome Speech of our
next Days Bu&s;ine&s;s, I told him plainly,
<PB N="38" REF="44">
<HI>That having &s;pent much Time in this Vaca|tion,
in peru&s;ing the Books, I could not find
any where, but e&s;pecially in the An&s;wer of my
Lord of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>, that which would give me Con|tentment.</HI>
I read the Places, and my Lord
confe&s;s'd with me, <HI>That there was not enough.</HI>
He told me al&s;o, <HI>That unle&s;s I gave my Con|&s;ent
to the Separation, that he would never
give his:</HI> So much Reverence in him did I
find both then, and divers Times before,
again&s;t this Divorcement. At la&s;t he men|tion'd
one Thing which pleas'd me won|drous
well, and that was, That we &s;hould
call for my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> again, and new
examine him, upon &s;ome Points to be far|ther
declar'd, <HI>ad informandum animum Ju|dicis.</HI>
For hence, either we &s;hould know
&s;o much as might per&s;wade us to decree a
Separation, or the World might be &s;atisfy'd
that we had no Rea&s;on for it. The&s;e
Things thus &s;ettled, his Lord&s;hip &s;epara|teth.
Then I withdrew my &s;elf to my
Study, and read over again and again, the
Papers from the King. I found them very
&s;harp, and perceiv'd by the Time that they
arriv'd unto me, that they were detain'd
'till that Day, that I might be overwhelm'd
with them on the &s;udden, and have no
Time to deliberate, before we were to come
the &s;econd Time to &s;it in Judgment. The&s;e
things did much trouble me, &s;o that I
did &s;leep but a little that Night. I revol|ved
<PB N="39" REF="45">
many things, and much tumbling I
had in my Miud. It griev'd me infinite|ly,
that the King &s;hould make him&s;elf a
Party therein; That &s;ome Unthankful|ne&s;s,
and other Matters, were little le&s;s
then Reproaches unto me: Methought my
faithful Heart to my Ma&s;ter, de&s;erv'd no
&s;uch Sharpne&s;s. I devis'd how I might
give the King Contentment, and it was
&s;ome Comfort to me, that we had thought
upon a Cour&s;e of new examining my Lord
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> But as things &s;tood, I could not
force my Con&s;cience, which cry'd upon me,
<HI>That it was an odious Thing to GOD and
Men, to give &s;uch a Sentence, without better
warrant.</HI> I here ca&s;t what might befal
to the Church in my Di&s;grace; how <HI>Pa|pi&s;ts</HI>
would &s;corn at it; how it might be
my own Ruin, and that divers ways; a
Hazard to my Friends, and to the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
which were of my Mind; how
my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> had a Wife and Chil|dren,
which might all be overthrown at
one Blow. But after Midnight &s;leeping,
towards the Morning I con&s;ider'd on the
other Side, That my Con&s;cience was more
unto me than all the World; that it was
a fearful thing, in Place of Judgment, to
give a Sentence again&s;t mine own Heart;
That <HI>Olivarius,</HI> the Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI>
upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, grew Mad, and
dy'd in it: That the Manner of our Sen|tence,
<PB N="40" REF="46">
mu&s;t be <HI>Solum Deum prae Oculis ba|bentes,
a rei veritate in&s;pecta</HI>; all which,
and the like Meditations, did much pre|ponderate
with me. Then I &s;lept again,
and now ri&s;ing, I found my Heart much
&s;ettled, to per&s;i&s;t in that which I held to
be Truth. I pour'd out earne&s;tly my Pray|ers
to God, and was now &s;trongly re&s;olv'd,
to leave all to God, remembring, That
he had pre&s;erv'd me from my Mother's
Womb; that he had from Time to Time,
rid me out of all my Troubles; that his
Power was the &s;ame &s;till; that he would
never for&s;ake me, if I turn'd not from
him. I forgot not, <HI>That the Hearts of Kings
were in the Hand of the Lord</HI>; that I had
Experience of the Graciou&s;ne&s;s, both of
GOD and the King, the Year before;
when &s;tanding earne&s;tly in a good Cau&s;e,
that Prince <HI>Henry</HI> &s;hould not marry a
<HI>Papist,</HI> I receiv'd &s;ome &s;harp Words from
the King for my Labour; but the next
Day his Maje&s;ty us'd me very kindly
again. To this I added, That Poverty,
Impri&s;onment, Death it &s;elf, were things
contemptible to a re&s;olv'd Mind: That
&s;ome of my Predece&s;&s;ors, as Arch-Bi&s;hop
<HI>Cranmer,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Grindal,</HI> had given
good Examples of the&s;e Sufferings, and
they were recorded in the Catalogue of
the Righteous. The&s;e Thoughts thus re|volv'd,
I read again the Letter from the
<PB N="41" REF="47">
King, and drawing out into a Paper, all
the &s;harp Words, I con&s;ider'd them again
and again, and methought they were
not altogether &s;o bitter as I apprehended
them; that they were wrung from his Ma|je&s;ty
by my Lord Chamberlain's Impor|tunity;
that my Ma&s;ter had de&s;erv'd at
my Hands, that I &s;hould bear patiently
twenty times more; and that all was no|thing,
&s;o the Clearne&s;s of my Con&s;cience
might be pre&s;erv'd. With the&s;e Re&s;oluti|ons
on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> I came to <HI>Lambeth,</HI>
where I met with the News of <HI>Overbury</HI>'s
Death, and the &s;ound of &s;ome fearful Ap|prehen&s;ions
thereupon, bruted about the
City. I made Trial of my Lord of <HI>Lon|don</HI>'s
Con&s;tancy, telling him, <HI>aut cidendum,
aut cadendum.</HI> I found him mo&s;t re&s;olv'd,
avowing unto me, <HI>That if he &s;hould pronounce
for the Di&s;&s;olution of the Marriage, he thought
the Devil would that Night fetch away his
Soul.</HI> Yea, he was earne&s;t on me, to per|&s;i&s;t
where I began, telling me, <HI>That the
Eyes of the whole Church of</HI> England <HI>were
upon me, and expected of me, that I &s;hould
&s;hew my &s;elf a worthy Man.</HI> At la&s;t we
came to &s;it, where my Lords of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>
and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> took their Places. The Com|mi&s;&s;ion
was read, the Fact, and Manner of
the Proce&s;s was open'd, and nothing notable
done, &s;aving that my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> pro|po&s;ing,
that it was fit that my Lord of
<PB N="42" REF="48">
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould be call'd to explain him&s;elf
farther, for the fi&s;hing out of the Truth, all
the Commi&s;&s;ioners mo&s;t willing a&s;&s;ented
thereunto, (yea, my Lords of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>
and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> expre&s;sly,) &s;aving Sir <HI>Ju|lius
Cae&s;ar,</HI> who &s;oftly declar'd his Di&s;like
thereof, in my hearing. When the Court
was ri&s;en, I &s;pake with my Lord of <HI>Litch|field,</HI>
and not thinking fit to return any
thing to the King in Writing, I pray'd
him to acquaint his Maje&s;ty how Things
&s;tood; and to tell him, that upon this
Cour&s;e of new calling my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI>
I hop'd in the End, we &s;hould give his
Maje&s;ty Satisfaction. The <HI>Sunday</HI> I &s;pent at
<HI>Croydon,</HI> and preach'd on that Text of
Chri&s;t's rai&s;ing the Widow's Son of <HI>Naim,</HI>
to the great Comfort of mine own Heart.
That Day I conferr'd with a Friend, and
&s;ettled &s;ome Cour&s;es, if any Trouble &s;hould
befal unto me. I was al&s;o by a good Friend
inform'd, that my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> on that
<HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, having five or &s;ix Cap|tains,
and Gentlemen of Worth in his Cham|ber,
and Speech being made of his Inabili|ty,
ro&s;e out of his Bed, and taking up his
Shirt, did &s;hew to them all, &s;o able, and
extraordinarily &s;ufficient Matter, that they
all cry'd out Shame of his Lady, and &s;aid,
That if the Ladies of the Court knew as
much as they knew, they would tread her
to Death.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49">
On the <HI>Monday</HI> we met at <HI>Lambeth</HI> a|gain,
and Information was given on the
Part of my Lady. The&s;e things pa&s;s'd
quietly. When the Court was ri&s;en, my
Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> told me, That he had
made his Maje&s;ty acquainted with our Pro|po&s;ition
on <HI>Saturday,</HI> but that his Maje&s;ty
was &s;trongly again&s;t it, my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
&s;hould any more be call'd, and that by no
means he would endure it; for that per|adventure,
the &s;aid Earl, either being pro|vok'd
by the late Challenge between him
and Mr. <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> or otherwi&s;e in&s;ti|gated
by the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> might
&s;peak &s;omewhat which might marr the
Bu&s;ine&s;s. This made me &s;till &s;u&s;pect, that
all was not right, and I reply'd to my
Lord, <HI>If that be deny'd us, and we have no
farther Proof, I &s;hall never give Sentence for
the Nullity: As good declare my Mind at fir&s;t,
as at la&s;t, and I pray you &s;o acquaint his Ma|je&s;ty.</HI>
When I went Homeward, I much
revolv'd this in my Heart, thinking, Good
Lord! What a Ca&s;e is this? Shall any
Truth be kept from us? Are they afraid
to have all out? Do they only look to
attain their own Ends, and care not how
our Con&s;ciences be intangled and en&s;nar'd?
On the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> we met again, and now
Dr. <HI>James</HI> is come to us, and by and by
cometh in my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> who, as it
&s;eem'd, had meant to have kept him away,
<PB N="44" REF="50">
but the King &s;ent an expre&s;s Me&s;&s;enger
for him, requiring him by a Letter, to be
there on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night. Now are we
<HI>plena Curia.</HI> Before we &s;ate down, Sir
<HI>Thomas Lake</HI> delivereth a Me&s;&s;age unto me
from the King, That his Maje&s;ty de&s;ir'd
a &s;peedy End of this Bu&s;ine&s;s; that it had
hung long, and the World was in expecta|tion
of it; that the Term grew on, which
would be full of Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es: That his Ma|je&s;ty
on <HI>Monday,</HI> was to go to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI>
to meet the Queen, and my Lord <HI>Chamber|lain</HI>
with him; that therefore he would have
us to fall clo&s;e to our Work, not to trouble
our &s;elves on the Morrow, to come &s;ee
the King, who would come late to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
becau&s;e &s;ome Ceremonies were to be
perform'd, as upon the la&s;t Day of Hunt|ing;
that we &s;hould not attend his Ma|je&s;ty
'till <HI>Friday,</HI> but that the Sentence mu&s;t
be given on <HI>Saturday.</HI> My An&s;wer was
publickly, <HI>That there &s;hould be no Stay in me,
and that therefore on the Morrow, we would
&s;it Forenoon and Afternoon, if the Commi&s;|&s;ioners
&s;o pleas'd; and if they thought good,
Is would not refu&s;e to &s;it until Midnight.</HI>
But in mine own Heart I perceiv'd, that all
the Care was, that the Matter might be
di&s;patch'd before the Queen &s;pake with the
King, whom they &s;uppos'd not to wi&s;h
well to the Bu&s;ine&s;s. We go to our Court,
and Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> &s;tay'd to hear the
<PB N="45" REF="51">
Information on my Lord's Part. It was
&s;trange, to &s;ee how my Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>
carry'd him&s;elf that Day, partly to play
his Prizes before Sir <HI>Thomas Lake,</HI> who
might make Report of it to his Fame,
and partly to &s;hew his Ludi-magi&s;terial
Di&s;po&s;ition. He &s;napp'd up my Lord's
Council, that they could not &s;peak a
Word, but he catch'd it before it was out.
I know what you will &s;ay, when indeed
he knew not, neither was it any &s;uch
Matter as he imagin'd. God Almighty
will tell you a Tale for that; <HI>I tell you,
Doctor</HI> Bennet<HI>, I have as much Law as you,
I am as good a Lawyer as you are.</HI> He fell
divers Times on my Lord of <HI>London</HI> Per|&s;onally,
and would needs know of him
openly, <HI>How many times in a Year, a Man was
bound Carnally to know his Wife.</HI> In a Word,
with Scoffs, and imperious Behaviour, he
play'd the Advocate all that Day, to the
great Offence of the Standers by, &s;o that
it was publickly &s;poke of in <HI>London,</HI> which,
I think, came to his Ears; &s;o that ever
afterward, he carry'd him&s;elf more tracta|ble.
I was forc'd to bear it, becau&s;e of
avoiding new Complaints.</P>
<P>The Point mo&s;t ob&s;ervable that Day,
was, that both my Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI>
and my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> did deny Maleficiati|on,
&s;o that by no Means they would
have this Que&s;tion to proceed in that Na|ture,
<PB N="46" REF="52">
which I openly did thank them for,
and bound it upon, before all the Commi&s;|&s;ioners
and Standers by, telling them, <HI>That
the &s;ame was my Opinion.</HI> But I a&s;k'd my
Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> who &s;ate by me, <HI>What
be then held it to be.</HI> He told me private|ly,
<HI>That he held it to be a Natural Impotency,
which was before the Marriage.</HI> I a&s;k'd him,
<HI>What that might be, and whence he gather'd it.</HI>
He an&s;wer'd, <HI>I have heard divers Particu|lars,
which are enough to per&s;wade me if they
be True. Yea,</HI> my Lord &s;aid I, <HI>if they be
True, I have heard as many to the contrary.
I wi&s;h that we might examine, whether they
be True or no; that were fair Proceeding.
It is my Grief, that it is not permitted unto
us, to try whether all the&s;e Matters be &s;o or
not. This might &s;atisfy a Man's Con&s;cience.</HI>
So we parted that Night.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> at Ten of the Clock,
we met in <HI>Lambeth-Hall,</HI> where my Lady's
Council took on them, to an&s;wer &s;ome
Scruples objected by Dr. <HI>Ferrand.</HI> But Dr.
<HI>Martin,</HI> when no Body &s;pake of it, fell
to wipe away that Objection, that my
Lord had not &s;worn, <HI>Cum Septima mann.</HI>
Upon his Speech, the Commi&s;&s;ioners took
hold of it, and it then being urg'd &s;trong|ly,
my Lady's Council &s;tood at fir&s;t, as if
they had been bla&s;ted with Lightning.
Afterward they grew extream angry with
Dr. <HI>Martin,</HI> that he had propos'd it, but
<PB N="47" REF="53">
the I&s;&s;ue was, there could no An&s;wer be
given unto it; but in the Sight of all
the Standers by, this was broke off with
Shame and Confu&s;ion of Faces. We din'd
not that Day, but about one or two of the
Clock, we withdrew our &s;elves privately
into the Parlour. I had thought there to
have had Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and the re&s;t who
lik'd not of the Nullity, to propound their
Doubts, and &s;o in Order; and la&s;t of all,
I would have &s;poken. But there I found
a contrary Cour&s;e re&s;olv'd, which my Lord
of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> &s;eem'd much to di&s;like. But
my Lord of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> had &s;et the Clock, and they
mu&s;t have their Will. The &s;ix Rea&s;ons are
produc'd, which Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> had deli|ver'd
the Day after we came from <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI>
and the Copy whereof, was by me &s;ent
to the King. All the&s;e mu&s;t in their Or|der
be debated. One was about the unper|fectne&s;s
of the Libel, in which we all re|ceiv'd
Satisfaction, that the Libel was well
to &s;o much purpo&s;e as now they declar'd
they would have it. The other five, my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> maintain'd: I allow'd of
three of them ab&s;olutely&punc; and the other
two, that was In&s;pection of my Lord's Bo|dy,
and a Time to be a&s;&s;ign'd by the
Judge, to try whether they might Carnal|ly
know one another, I held to be fit,
<PB N="48" REF="54">
when tho&s;e Rea&s;ons were propos'd; but
now &s;uch Flames and Quarrels were ari&s;en,
I thought not ami&s;s now to be forborn
My Lord of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> with a Pen, did
note what every Man re&s;olv'd, but prin|cipally
my Words, with a Purpo&s;e to
&s;hew them to the King, as I conceiv'd,
and afterwards I found it to be &s;o. I was
de&s;irous therefore, that his Maje&s;ty might
&s;ee I was not Ob&s;tinate, but &s;ettled to yield
to Rea&s;on. And again, I &s;uppos'd, that
this Candor of mine, would make &s;ome
of them yield to us, where they &s;aw there
was unevitable Truth. But I found it far
otherwi&s;e, for our Afternoon's Work was,
that they gave &s;huffling and &s;hifting An|&s;wers
to the Objections, &s;uch as them&s;elves
had &s;tudy'd all the Vacation; but no Care
was, whither they were True and Satisfacto|ry,
or not. And to what Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> pro|pos'd,
all Seven of them con&s;ented, without
&s;ticking or &s;cruple, &s;o that I might ima|gine
it was a &s;et Play. Upon the fir&s;t
Scruple debating, Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> finding
the Difference of Opinions, and that our
Lawyers &s;tuck &s;trongly unto it, <HI>Let us,</HI>
&s;aith he, <HI>put it to the Que&s;tion, and let the
major Part of Voices determine it.</HI> When
I &s;aw this to be the Proceeding, the Lord,
thought I, deliver me from &s;uch Judges.
But yet ob&s;erving their Manner, I po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
my Soul in Patience. When it grew
<PB N="49" REF="55">
to be dark, that the King might under&s;tand,
that I was willing to allow time to all that
might be &s;aid, I remember'd Sir <HI>John Ben|net</HI>
to read the Sentence of the <HI>Rota Romana,</HI>
where, in the Popes own Con&s;i&s;tory, about
the Year 1585, a Judgment was revers'd,
which an Arch-bi&s;hop in <HI>Spain,</HI> had given
for a Nullity, in a Ca&s;e being ours alto|gether,
becau&s;e, after the triennial Coha|bitation,
he had not a&s;&s;ign'd a Time for
the marry'd Couple to make Trial again,
and to u&s;e Fa&s;ting and Prayer. This Re|peal
was read at large, and &s;o was another
of the <HI>Rota,</HI> in the &s;ame Kind. But both
the&s;e were &s;lighted, as Matters of Nothing,
and &s;o I think had St. <HI>Paul</HI> been, if he
had been there. I urg'd that of <HI>Alexan|der</HI>
III, That even in <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, no
Nullity had been allow'd; but that it was
<HI>Con&s;uetudo generalis Eccle&s;iae Gallicanae</HI>; and
that <HI>Eccle&s;ia Romana,</HI> did know or practice
no &s;uch thing. This was &s;lighted like the
former, and I perceiv'd it was but in vain to
&s;peak to them, for they were re&s;olv'd, and
be it Good, or be it Bad, the Matter &s;hould
be done.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Friday</HI> Morning I went to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
and looking &s;omewhat heavily, the
King cometh to me, and to my Lord Chan|cellor,
and offereth us both his Hand to
ki&s;s. He might perceive by my Counte|nance
that I was not a little troubl'd, and
<PB N="50" REF="56">
that was perceiv'd by divers of the Lords,
who privately let me know their Minds,
that we had a foul and &s;trange Matter
in Hand at <HI>Lambeth.</HI> At la&s;t, the King
takes me a&s;ide, and after propounding
three or four Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, walking, he took
me to the Window, and a&s;k'd me, <HI>How
that great Cau&s;e did go forward?</HI> I told
his Maje&s;ty, <HI>That I had no Liking of it;
that I had receiv'd a Letter and Writing from
him which very much troubled me, for I knew
my &s;elf to be his dutiful Servant, and had not
de&s;erv'd Ill of him; that it was nothing to me
whether &s;he remain'd Wife to the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>,
or were marry'd to another Man; but that I
might not give Sentence where I &s;aw no Proof;
that I had liv'd fifty one Years, almo&s;t, and had
my Con&s;cience uncorrupted in Judgment; that
I knew not how &s;oon I was to be call'd before
God, and I was loath, again&s;t that Time, to
give a Wound to mine own Soul; that all my
Grief was, that his Maje&s;ty's Hand was in it;
that for other Men I car'd not; that I cho&s;e
rather to die an hone&s;t Man than a wi&s;e Man;
that he mu&s;t never afterward expect true Service
of me, for, how could I be true to him, who
was fal&s;e unto God; that if he mark'd it
well, this was no Time to di&s;grace his good
Servants:</HI> I told him, <HI>That if his Maje&s;ty
pleas'd to let the Matter alone, as he did all
other Cau&s;es, I would make good my Part again&s;t
all</HI> England<HI>, on the Peril of my Head.</HI> The
<PB N="51" REF="57">
King an&s;wer'd, <HI>That I would have no Law|yers.</HI>
I reply'd, <HI>Yes, enough, There is not
an hone&s;t Lawyer in</HI> England <HI>that would not
be on my Side.</HI> His Maje&s;ty a&s;k'd me, <HI>Whe|ther
the re&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, Ye&s;terday, did
not per&s;wade me.</HI> I told him, <HI>No; but their
Dealing, rather drove me the contrary Way.
For,</HI> (&s;aid I) <HI>I came thither ingeniou&s;ly to
yield to any Truth that &s;hould be &s;hew'd me; but
they, on the contrary Part, in a factious Cour&s;e
went wholly together, and what one &s;aid, ano|ther
&s;aid, be it Well, or be it Ill, without any
Scruple.</HI> To my Speech, <HI>That it was an
Example that never had been in</HI> England;
the King &s;aid, <HI>Yes,</HI> Berry'<HI>s Ca&s;e.</HI> I be&s;eech'd
his Maje&s;ty, <HI>That he would not believe that
Cau&s;e to be any &s;uch Matter; for if he would
pardon me, it &s;hould not be long before that I
would &s;hew, that his Separation was for Lack
of his Stones.</HI> In this debating, the King
was very de&s;irous to know, what &s;hould be
the Rea&s;ons whereupon I &s;tood, that I
might have Satisfaction. My An&s;wer was,
<HI>That when I was in Place of Judgment, I would
not conceal the Rea&s;ons of my Sentence, but it
was to no Purpo&s;e to &s;peak them now; it would
but put his Maje&s;ty to a new Trouble to hear
them, and then &s;ome Man mu&s;t an&s;wer them,
who look'd to his own End, and to make a plau|&s;ible
An&s;wer, which would not content me,
without ground of Truth.</HI> A great Part of
the Time, that I had this Speech with the
<PB N="52" REF="58">
King, my Eyes were full of Tears, which
I &s;aw, much mov'd my gracious Ma&s;ter,
and e&s;pecially, my earne&s;t De&s;ire, <HI>That I
might do my Con&s;cience.</HI> I perceiv'd the King
was much overcome, by this my hone&s;t
Dealing: And then, whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty
went to &s;peak with my Lord Privy-Seal,
and my Lord Chamberlain, who &s;tood all
this while at the farther End of the Gal|lery;
and to whom, I conceiv'd, the King
told much of that which I had &s;poken; I
went my ways to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to Dinner.
Now grew I confident to do my Con&s;cience
right, what&s;oever came of it. That Day
I din'd privately, but yet, my Lord Bi|&s;hop
of <HI>Bath</HI> was with me, whom, when I
had acquainted with &s;o much of the Cau&s;e,
as I thought fit, I receiv'd no Di&s;courag|ment
from him. My Heart was much
eas'd, and now I thought I &s;hould no more
be troubled. Yet, between three and four
a Clock, after Dinner, my Lord of <HI>Litch|field</HI>
cometh to me from the King, and
bringeth a written Treati&s;e upon the pre|&s;ent
Argument, which was the Work of a
<HI>Scotchman,</HI> I know not who. I receiv'd it,
and promis'd that Night to read it; as in|deed
I did, riding in my Coach to <HI>Croydon</HI>;
for thither I thought fit to withdraw my
&s;elf, though it were late, for avoiding of
more Perturbation. This Treati&s;e no way
pleas'd me, but I thought it the Work of
<PB N="53" REF="59">
&s;ome hungry Fellow, who lack'd twenty
Shillings to buy Food to his Belly. Here,
finding it the Day of the End of my Quar|ter,
I &s;ettled much of my dome&s;tick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
I forgot not to commend my &s;elf,
and the whole Cau&s;e, to God by Prayer.
I meditated many Things in my Bed: In
the Morning I ro&s;e early, and before Day,
in my Study, I &s;et down &s;ome Heads, what
I would &s;peak unto. Then went I early
to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and there &s;upply'd my brief
Notes, dige&s;ting my Matter of Sentence
into Order; being re&s;olv'd to &s;peak large,
and home to the Cau&s;e, without Touch of
any Per&s;on more than I mu&s;t needs. By
this Time, mo&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners were
come. I &s;ent for my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> Sir
<HI>John Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI>
&s;ingly and &s;everally, into my Study: I
requir'd them, before God, not to &s;peak
any thing for re&s;pect to me, but to do that,
which in their Learning and Con&s;cience
they thought to be ju&s;t, and to &s;peak that
<HI>intrepid,</HI> without Blemi&s;h to any Man,
but &s;oundly to the Matter. I found them
all avowing, that in their Souls, they found
no Warrant for the Nullity. I then
wi&s;h'd &s;everally, Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ed|wards,</HI>
to deliver their Sentence, with &s;ome
Rea&s;ons adjoyn'd, not many, but of the
&s;tronge&s;t. I told Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> that this
Day, I expected he &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf a
<PB N="54" REF="60">
worthy Man; that he &s;hould deliver his
Judgment <HI>per exten&s;um</HI>; that they had
labour'd to blemi&s;h his Skill, and to &s;light
his Learning e&s;pecially, therefore, both
for his Con&s;cience, and his Credit, he
&s;hould &s;hew what was in him, to maintain
an hone&s;t Cau&s;e. If Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who came after him, &s;hould
be&s;patter him in their Choler, or lay any
Imputation upon him, he &s;hould find that
&s;ome of us would take it off him. To my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>We have three that
&s;peak fir&s;t, who, I tru&s;t, will lay &s;uch a Founda|tion
in the Heart of the Hearers, as &s;hall not
be remov'd. But the other Side have this Advan|tage
over us, they are &s;even of them Lawyers
and Bi&s;hops, to an&s;wer what our three have
&s;aid; and perhaps with weak Men, &s;uch a Stream
of &s;uch Per&s;ons may much prevail: But let not
that di&s;may you, my Lord, only take this Cour&s;e;
Deliver, fir&s;t, your own Meditations; and then,
having taken with your Pen, &s;ome of the Ab|&s;urdities,
which, in the Sentence, &s;ome of them
will deliver, bla&s;t tho&s;e, and let the Auditors
&s;ee, that by you the Stream is turn'd. Then
leave it to me, and I doubt not, in Almighty
God, but to batter their Nullity to Du&s;t. That
tho' they have it by the major part of Voices,
yet, the World &s;hall &s;ee what the Cau&s;e is, and
they &s;hall have little Comfort by it. I am very
well provided; I am no way afraid; and you
&s;hall &s;ee, I will not be Tongue-ty'd.</HI> So confi|dent
<PB N="55" REF="61">
was I in the Hone&s;ty of the Cau&s;e,
and in the Helps of Almighty God, that I
was not now afraid of ten thou&s;ands of
People; but did long to be at the Bu&s;ine&s;s,
as the Lord truely knoweth.</P>
<P>When now I was alone, revolving my
Meditations, Sir <HI>J. Cae&s;ar</HI> cometh into my
Study, to me, telleth me, <HI>That he wonder'd
that my Lord of</HI> Winche&s;ter <HI>was not come,
that it was even ten a Clock, that therefore it
was fit, that the Hour &s;hould be continu'd from
ten to twelve.</HI> I a&s;&s;ented thereto; and by
&s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners the Time was
prorogu'd. Then cometh in Sir <HI>Thomas
Lake,</HI> with a Me&s;&s;age from the King, which
he mu&s;t not deliver 'till all the Commi&s;&s;i|oners
were come together. So he was forc'd
to &s;tay. Between Ten and Eleven, cometh
in my Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>; who, as afterwards
found, had been all the Morning at the
Court. I told him, <HI>We had &s;tay'd for him
two Hours and a half.</HI> His Lord&s;hip &s;light|ly
excus'd it. Then, in the Gallery, Sir
<HI>Thomas Lake</HI> told us, <HI>That his Maje&s;ty had
&s;ent him unto us, to deliver two Things.</HI> The
one was, <HI>That in our Sentence, we &s;hould take
heed of gauling of any Per&s;on.</HI> My An&s;wer
was, <HI>That from the Beginning of this Proce&s;s,
we had ever been wary not to offend in that
Kind; and that he &s;hould be much to Blame,
who, in the Conclu&s;ion, would tran&s;gre&s;s that
way.</HI> And &s;o &s;aid the re&s;t. The other was,
<PB N="56" REF="62">
<HI>That we &s;hould not in any long Manner, but
compendiou&s;ly, deliver what we had to &s;ay.</HI> I
pray'd Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> to explain that far|ther,
whether we were only to &s;ay Yea or
or No, and no more: For I would obey the
King's Commandment.</P>
<P><HI>Tu Regina jube, mihi ju&s;&s;a cape&s;&s;ere fas e&s;t.</HI>
He an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he could not &s;ay &s;o, but that
we were to &s;peak briefly. Yea,</HI> but &s;aid Sir <HI>Julius
Cae&s;ar, I know the King's Mind; for I was Ye&s;ter|day
with him, and he told me, that he expected that
we &s;hould go no farther than Yea, or Nay, for
of Rea&s;ons there would be no End. Yea,</HI> &s;aith
he, <HI>The King told me he was promis'd &s;o much.
By whom,</HI> &s;aid I. <HI>I think,</HI> quoth he, <HI>by your
Grace. Not &s;o,</HI> &s;aid I: But I &s;aid, indeed,
<HI>Let every Man deliver his own Con&s;cience, I
will not perturb the Sentence. No more indeed
will I.</HI> Then he replyeth, <HI>I know the King
expecteth we &s;hould &s;ay no more, than I do like
this Sentence, or, I do not like it. And that
you know, Sir</HI> Daniel Dun<HI>, is the Manner of
the Delegates, and not to go farther. It is &s;o,</HI>
&s;aith Sir <HI>Daniel.</HI> Upon this, the Bi&s;hops
all &s;aid, <HI>We were be&s;t to proceed in that Fa&s;hi|on.</HI>
To which, I reply'd, <HI>I will not be
willful, but if it be agreed upon, and it be
the King's Plea&s;ure, I will obey. But look you
to it; for if any Man give a Rea&s;on, I am
no more bound than he, but that I will return
the Rea&s;on of my Opinion and Judgment.</HI>
They all &s;aid, they would be ob&s;ervant of
<PB N="57" REF="63">
it. Thus Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd.
Then we call'd for the Sentences on both
Sides, which the Coun&s;el had ready. They
di&s;lik'd that which was Ab&s;olutory of the
Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and we approv'd it. We
found Fault with the other Sentence,
Anullatory, both for the Whole, and be|cau&s;e,
&s;ome Parts in it, in our Judgment,
were apparently fal&s;e. But they per&s;i&s;ted
in their Intention. So we went into the
Hall, where, my &s;elf, my Lord of <HI>London,</HI>
Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ed|wards,</HI>
freed my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> The Bi|&s;hops
of <HI>Winton, Ely, Litchfield,</HI> and <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI>
together with the two Chancellors,
and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> pronounc'd for the
Nullity, and &s;ub&s;crib'd the Sentence, my
Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> pronouncing it. We per|ceiv'd
that they were afraid we &s;hould at
large &s;peak our Rea&s;ons openly, being the
la&s;t who were to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The three Bi&s;hops, of <HI>Winton, Ely,</HI>
and <HI>Litchfield,</HI> went immediately to the
Court, hoping to receive great Thanks for
their Service, but they waited a full Hour,
e'er they could &s;peak with the King; how|ever
they &s;ped afterward. And we were
glad that we were freed of the Trouble.
And now, I, who would not have given
the Sentence for all the Gold in <HI>India,</HI> do
expect God's Plea&s;ure, what will become of
this Bu&s;ine&s;s hereafter, and &s;ubmit my &s;elf
<PB N="58" REF="64">
to God's Providence, who ever pre&s;erveth
tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him.</P>
<CLOSER>THIS Narration is wholly written with
mine own Hand, and was fini&s;h'd the &s;econd
of <HI>October,</HI> 1613, being the eighth Day after
the giving of the Sentence. And I protest be|fore
Almighty God, that I have not willingly
written any Untruth therein; but have deliver'd
all things fairly, to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tand|ing;
helping my &s;elf with &s;uch Memorials

if there were occa&s;ion, I might thus at large
&s;et down the Truth to Po&s;terity, when this Ca&s;e
&s;hall be rung from <HI>Rome</HI> Gates, or the Fact

<HEAD>Some Ob&s;ervable Things, &s;ince <HI>Sept.</HI>
25, 1613, when the Sentence was
given in the Cau&s;e of the Earl of
ESSEX, continu'd unto the Day of
the Marriage, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 26, 1613.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Sentence being given for
the Nullity, the Minds of Men
in their &s;everal Places, were
wonderfully di&s;tracted, and e|very
one &s;pake according to
their Fancies. But for the mo&s;t part there
was a Dete&s;tation of the Thing, and a great
Di&s;like of tho&s;e that gave the Sentence,
which was expre&s;s'd by all Cour&s;es that
Men dur&s;t adventure upon. On the other
Side, there was a &s;trange applauding and
commending, of tho&s;e who with&s;tood the
Separation; and from all Parts a Te&s;timo|ny
came unto them, That they had done
like Hone&s;t Men, albeit the only Scope
which they aim'd at, was the Di&s;charge of
their Con&s;cience, and not vain Popular Ap|plau&s;e.
The Arch-bi&s;hop the Day after
the Sentence, went to the Court, to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
and waited on the King to Chapel,
<PB N="60" REF="66">
&s;tanding al&s;o by him in the Clo&s;et, where
he was &s;trangely look'd on by the King,
as he was al&s;o by &s;ome of the Lords; but
nothing being &s;aid unto him, he took no
Notice of it, but bore all patiently. This
Strangene&s;s of the King held on at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
and el&s;ewhere; and it came to the
Arch-bi&s;hop's Ear, that the King &s;pake
divers Times hardly of him, but much
magnify'd them of the Affirmative Part,
and e&s;pecially my Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> as
the worthie&s;t Man in the Kingdom. Some
things were done al&s;o in Recompence to
divers of them; as Sir <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Son
was made a Knight, my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI>'s
Son al&s;o had the &s;ame Reward, which &s;ome
merry Fellow blighted with the Name of
Sir <HI>Nullity Hil&s;on</HI>; and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litch|field</HI>
mu&s;t remove to <HI>Lincoln</HI>; and as for
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> it mu&s;t be be&s;tow'd on Mr. Dean
of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, that &s;o Doctor <HI>Cary</HI> might be
preferr'd to the Deanery of <HI>Paul</HI>'s, for which
it was generally &s;uppos'd, he &s;hould pay
well. But now it run currant, that the
Arch-bi&s;hop mu&s;t no more have to do
with Naming any to Church-Livings, but
&s;ome Lords in Court &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of all;
and principally it mu&s;t be provided, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Abbot</HI> mu&s;t never be preferr'd, no, not
&s;o much as to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> &s;o far was he from
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> which was formerly promis'd un|to
him. The&s;e things grew dete&s;table to
<PB N="61" REF="67">
the People, who fear'd that even Religion
would &s;mart for it; but the Parties mo&s;t
malign'd, were &s;ilent and patient, expect|ing
God's Lei&s;ure, and Malice enough from
&s;ome other Men. The fir&s;t thing of Bit|terne&s;s
that appear'd, was a Letter from
<HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI> under the King's Hand and Signet,
directed to the Commi&s;&s;ioners in the former
Sentence, but brought to the Arch-Bi&s;hop
about three Weeks after the Sentence. This
was a mo&s;t &s;harp Letter, complaining that
they of the Negative Part, for &s;o they
were &s;til'd, had hinder'd the Act to be
made upon the Sentence; had &s;olemnly
Prote&s;ted again&s;t that which was done; had
given unto them&s;elves other Titles than
were in the King's Commi&s;&s;ion; had glo|rify'd
them&s;elves in that which was done;
by which they laid an Imputation upon
the King's Con&s;cience, who had declar'd
him&s;elf for the Divorce, and other things
of the like Nature. This Letter being read
to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Arch-bi&s;hop &s;aid,
That he knew not what it meant; for he
under&s;tood of no Man that Prote&s;ted, nor
knew nothing of any Man's arrogating of
Titles to him, or glorifying him&s;elf: And
as for the Act, he &s;uppos'd it to be made
up in common Form, and never heard ought
to the contrary, neither meddled with any
thing therein, but left it to the Regi&s;ter,
and what he had done with it, he could not
<PB N="62" REF="68">
tell. Furthermore, he a&s;k'd all the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
particularly, if they knew what
this meant, or if any of them were able
to charge tho&s;e of the Negative, with
the Points quarrelled at; who all, with one
Con&s;ent, deny'd that they could, and
expre&s;sly averr'd, that there was no &s;uch
thing done at the Time of the Sentence,
as had been complain'd upon. When &s;tand|ing
thus in Admiration, Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI>
took upon him to under&s;tand the Matter,
and &s;aid, that if the Regi&s;ter were call'd,
it would appear there was &s;omething in it.
<HI>Barker,</HI> the Regi&s;ter, is &s;ent for, and being
demanded whether he had made up the Act,
he &s;aid that he had drawn it up in a Form
that he lik'd, but &s;ome other of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
did di&s;like it. And thereupon he
&s;hew'd two Forms, the one more large,
the other more brief; but both of them ha|ving
in it, that the Arch-bi&s;hop, and the
re&s;t of the Negative Party, prote&s;ted again&s;t
the Sentence. Here every Man wonder'd
at him, out of what Ground he &s;hould do
this; and all the Commi&s;&s;ioners with one
Con&s;ent, very much rebuk'd him, profe&s;|&s;ing,
that there was no &s;uch Prote&s;tation
us'd. For the re&s;t of the Charge in the
King's Letter, <HI>Barker</HI> freed all in all things,
&s;ave only Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who was ab&s;ent by
rea&s;on of his &s;ore Eyes. The Arch-bi&s;hop
upon this, de&s;ir'd the Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;u&s;|pend
<PB N="63" REF="69">
their Judgment touching Dr. <HI>Ed|wards,</HI>
'till he might an&s;wer for him&s;elf,
&s;aying, that Honour, Ju&s;tice, and Charity,
requir'd &s;o much in his Behalf; and adding
withal, that he doubted not but it would
prove &s;ome mi&s;taking of the Regi&s;ter's Part,
to whom it was apparent, that &s;mall Credit
was to be given, &s;ince he had &s;o gro&s;sly &s;et
down of them, that they Prote&s;ted, when
all the Commi&s;&s;ioners could witne&s;s the
contrary. Moreover he de&s;ir'd Mr. Chan|cellor
of the Exchequer, and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI>
to certify the Lord Chamberlain, how free
and innocent from tho&s;e A&s;per&s;ions, the
re&s;t were found, and that from Top to Toe,
it was nothing but Mi&s;pri&s;ion. Before this
Truth was di&s;cover'd, it was known that a
Gentleman of the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s,
had &s;aid to Sir <HI>John Levi&s;on,</HI> and that, as
from his Lord&s;hip, <HI>That there was &s;omething
de&s;cry'd, which would break the Arch-bi&s;hop</HI>'s
<HI>Back</HI>; &s;uch Account was made of his Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus Things pa&s;s'd &s;ilently until the
next Week, when upon the <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> be|ing
High Commi&s;&s;ion Day, Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>
being amended, repair'd to <HI>Lambeth.</HI> His
coming was watched; and then was deli|ver'd
to the Arch-bi&s;hop a &s;econd Letter
from the King, commending the Concur|rence
of all to the Act, to be made up in
common Form; but requiring the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="64" REF="70">
to convene Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and the
Regi&s;ter before them, and to charge them
with all the fore-remember'd Matters, and
to learn where the Fault did lie. It was
al&s;o commanded, that they &s;hould require
the &s;aid Doctor and Regi&s;ter, to &s;et down
in Writing what had pa&s;s'd between them;
and if it were found that Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> were
to blame, he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended 'till the
King's Plea&s;ure were farther known.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things are fallen upon; and Dr.
<HI>Edwards</HI> &s;hew'd that the Regi&s;ter had
wronged him, and that no Part of the Ac|cu&s;ation
was true, <HI>in modo &amp; forma,</HI> ap|pealing
to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, what Faith
might be given to <HI>Barker</HI> conte&s;ting again&s;t
him; when it had been manife&s;tly proved,
that he had forged the Matter of Prote|&s;tation
again&s;t my Lord of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> and the re&s;t. Time is a&s;|&s;igned
to them to deliver in their Writings,
and accordingly, about two Days after,
Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> bringeth to the Arch-bi&s;hop
his An&s;wer, denying the Points whereon
he was accus'd. But <HI>Barker</HI> brought no|thing
till a Fortnight after; and then, by
Candle-light, when the High-Commi&s;&s;ion
was ri&s;en, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners were de|parted,
he delivereth a long Writing to the
Arch-bi&s;hop, who could not read it that
Night; but reproved him for detaining
it &s;o long.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71">
On the Morrow, my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
perus'd this Declaration; as as he found it
to be uncertainly and diffidently &s;et down
for &s;ome other Circum&s;tances, &s;o he di&s;co|vered
there one Thing much to be ob&s;er|ved,
and that was, that <HI>Barker</HI> delivered,
That &s;ome few Days after the Sentence,
the Lord Chamberlain &s;ent for him, find|ing
Fault that the Act was not made up.
And there Speech was, That &s;ome de&s;ir'd
to have their Titles put in, as well as the
Titles of others; and for that, <HI>Barker</HI> na|med
Sir <HI>John Bennet.</HI> Whereunto the Lord
Chamberlain &s;aid, <HI>I know no Title that he
hath</HI>: <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Barker, he is Judge of the
Prerogative Court of</HI> Canterbury. But <HI>Bar|ker</HI>
concludeth the Narration, That him|&s;elf
finding that he had named Sir <HI>John
Bennet</HI> unju&s;tly, therefore was in mind to
excu&s;e him, and was about to &s;ay, that he
had done him Wrong; but the Lord Cham|berlain
was &s;o angry, that he could not bring
it forth; but went his Way, leaving the
Lord in that Opinion.</P>
<P>By this it was de&s;cry'd, that in the fir&s;t
Letter Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> was aim'd at, as
well as Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> to put &s;ome Di&s;grace
upon him, which made Men wonderou&s;ly
marvel at the vindicative Mind of &s;ome
Men, who &s;ought for an Occa&s;ion to do
other Men Di&s;grace. The End of the
Matter was, That no Man could be touch'd;
<PB N="66" REF="72">
and therefore the Arch-bi&s;hop, taking Sir
<HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> with him, acquainted the King
(who was now return'd from <HI>Roy&s;ton</HI>) with
the State of the whole Matter; informing
his Maje&s;ty, that Fault fell on no Man
&s;ave the Regi&s;ter; and therefore, if his
Highne&s;s were plea&s;ed to have him pu|ni&s;h'd,
it might be &s;o: But for the Thing
it&s;elf, &s;ince the Report was more than
there was Cau&s;e, Mr. Chancellor of the
<HI>Exchequer</HI> &s;aid, It was better to let it die,
and &s;tir in it no farther. To this the
King a&s;&s;ented, being not willing that any
Puni&s;hment &s;hould be laid on the Regi&s;ter;
whereby it appeared, that the Intendment
was, in the &s;tirring of the&s;e Coals, to
have burnt &s;ome greater Per&s;ons than <HI>Bar|ker,</HI>
the Regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>All this while it was confidently given
out, That becau&s;e the Sentence had been
oppos'd, there &s;hould a Book be written in
the Defence of it; and one while it &s;hould
be by a Divine, and that &s;ometimes was
my Lord of <HI>Winton,</HI> and &s;ometimes my
Lord of <HI>Ely</HI>; and it was &s;aid, they were
earne&s;tly about it: Another while, it
&s;hould be by a Civilian, and then Sir <HI>Da|niel
Dun</HI> mu&s;t do it: But at other Times it
mu&s;t be by a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> who had written
&s;omewhat of that Argument before the
Sentence; and other while two <HI>Scotchmen</HI>
mu&s;t join together about it: And to make
<PB N="67" REF="73">
the Thing the more probable, the Lord
<HI>Felton</HI> &s;ent to the Arch-bi&s;hop for the Copy
of the <HI>Scotch</HI>-man's Writing, which was
&s;ent unto him; and after copying of it out,
it was return'd to my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
again. This Speech of a Book continu'd
about nine Weeks in all; but at la&s;t Dr.
<HI>Stuart,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bird,</HI> were &s;ent for to the
Lord Chamberlain, and their Judgment
was ask'd concerning that Point. Their
Advice was, That it &s;hould by no means
be medled withal, but that Things &s;hould
die of them&s;elves: But no Que&s;tioning
by Writing; for &s;o it might go on to the
World's End: For one Book might breed
another; and &s;o, they whom it concern'd
&s;hould never be in re&s;t. This was re&s;olv'd
on; and afterwards there was no more
Speech of Writing, &s;aving only faintingly
and whi&s;peringly, but nothing to the
Purpo&s;e. It &s;eem'd that the Commi&s;&s;ioners
who were for the Nullity had enough of it,
and de&s;ir'd no more to bring them&s;elves
on the Stage, being &s;o by all Men ex|claim'd
upon for that which they had
done.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winton,</HI> after the Sen|tence,
went down with great Jollity, full
of Hope and Glory; but within a while
after, he grew much daunted, as &s;ome a|bout
him, and namely his own Daughter,
reported; for he heard many Ways of the
<PB N="68" REF="74">
&s;trange Dete&s;tation which the World had
of the Deed; and the nick-naming of his
Son, much affected him: But his Adver|ti&s;ements
from Sir <HI>Richard Norton,</HI> his Son-in-Law
did much trouble him: For Sir <HI>Ri|chard</HI>
wrote divers Times from <HI>London</HI> to
his Wife, That he could come in no Place,
but his Father-in-Law was rail'd upon:
That Men told him, that he thought he
had a Wife, but it was no longer than my
Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> pleas'd; for when&s;oever he
offended him he could make a Nullity
between them. Be&s;ides, the &s;aid Sir <HI>Ri|chard</HI>
told Mr. <HI>John More</HI> of <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-Inn,
divers Times, <HI>That it was &s;uch a Di&s;grace
unto him to hear how the World talk'd of that
Sentence, that although my Lord of</HI> Winton
<HI>promi&s;ed to give him, his Wife, and Family,
their Diet and Entertainment &s;o long as he
lived, yet he would get him to his own Hou&s;e,
and live there, where he had Means &s;ufficient,
and not be &s;ubject to that perpetual Scorn which
would follow him &s;o long as he remain'd in his
Father-in-Law's Company.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e, and the like Pa&s;&s;ages, it was
gue&s;s'd, that the re&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
who were for the Sentence, had little Com|fort
in them&s;elves of that which they had
done. On the other Part, the Arch-bi&s;hop,
and tho&s;e who &s;tood with him, had their
Hone&s;ty and Ju&s;tice &s;ounded out every Day
more and more; and many Me&s;&s;ages were
<PB N="69" REF="75">
brought them, and divers Letters written
unto them, or &s;hew'd them by &s;ome Friends,
from &s;undry of the Bi&s;hops in the Land,
from the Univer&s;ities, from many godly
Preachers out of all Parts, which was an
exceeding Con&s;olation unto them, among
the many Frowns which they did bear,
That there was an univer&s;al Concurrence
of all hone&s;t Men to approve that which
they had done. And the Arch-bi&s;hop had
privately, from many great ones in Court,
and Nobles, and worthy Per&s;onages el&s;e|where,
&s;uch Significations of their good
Acceptance which he did, that it cheer'd
him much inwardly, and he was nothing
di&s;may'd.</P>
<P>Now, about the Middle of <HI>November,</HI> the
Wheel was turn'd about: For &s;ince nothing
could be gain'd by &s;peaking hardly of the
negative Part, they thought they would
make U&s;e of them another Way, and that
&s;hould be by making the World believe,
that they had now given Approbation of
the Fact. And thereupon it was, in Court
and <HI>London,</HI> a&s;&s;everantly given out; and
the Fame of it went far and near, That
the Arch-bi&s;hop, and the re&s;t, after more
mature Deliberation, had te&s;tify'd their
Concurrence with the re&s;t of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners,
and all now were of one Mind.
Men did not ha&s;tily believe this; but yet
divers of good Rank came and &s;ent to the
<PB N="70" REF="76">
Arch-bi&s;hop and the re&s;t, to know whether
tho&s;e things were &s;o or no. And when it
was found to be but a Jargon, it gave a
great deal of Contentment, and remov'd a|way
much Scandal which formerly was ta|ken.
Yet again afterward it was bruted,
the &s;econd Time, That my Lord of <HI>Can|terbury</HI>
had given the King Satisfaction in
the Matter; and my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> on
&s;uch a <HI>Sunday,</HI> had come and &s;ubmitted
him&s;elf to my Lord Chamberlain, and the
re&s;t had relented. Nay, it went &s;o far,
that in <HI>Yelverton,</HI> the King's Solicitor, and a
great Dependent upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Suf|folk,</HI>
told Mr. <HI>Pye</HI> the Coun&s;ellor, and Mr.
<HI>Cholmeley</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Solicitor, co|ming
unto him about Books to be drawn
up, for pa&s;&s;ing back the Jointure of the
Lady <HI>Frances</HI>'s Part, and the Portion of
the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Part, <HI>That the gain&s;aying
Commi&s;&s;ioners were now con&s;enting, and the great
Man beyond the Water was come over</HI>; which
he knew &s;o a&s;&s;uredly, that <HI>he had &s;een it ra|tify'd
by the Sub&s;cription of the Arch-bi&s;hop and
the re&s;t.</HI> Yea, farther, he added, that <HI>there
was great Rea&s;on, at the fir&s;t, wherefore my
Lord of</HI> Canterbury<HI>, and the others, &s;hould
&s;tand again&s;t the Separation; for they had ju&s;t
Cau&s;e, at the fir&s;t, to fear that this Fact might
be drawn into Example, and &s;o Marriages ordi|narily
be violated; but now it was re&s;olv'd that
no more &s;uch &s;hould be permitted, and thereupon</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="77">
<HI>they a&s;&s;ented.</HI> The&s;e Things were inforc'd to
be endur'd with Silence, for the avoiding
of Clamour, and making of Trouble.</P>
<P>But now behold an admirable Device of
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> which &s;heweth
what his own Opinion was of the Validity
of the Sentence. I will &s;et it down as it
came to be acted.</P>
<P>On the 26th of <HI>November, Searle</HI> the
Proctor cometh to my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and bringeth with him a Writ
of <HI>Certiorari</HI> out of the Chancery, direct|ed
to the Commi&s;&s;ioners in the Cau&s;e be|tween
the Lady <HI>Frances</HI> and the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> The Arch-bi&s;hop was pray'd to
open it, and &s;o he did, and there found
that four of them, <HI>&s;ub &s;igillis ve&s;tris</HI> were, re|quired
to certify <HI>Recordum Sententiae,</HI> into
the Chancery. The Arch bi&s;hop a&s;ked
<HI>Searle, If this were an u&s;ual Thing?</HI> Who
an&s;wered, <HI>No, he had not known any &s;uch
Thing before:</HI> It is reply'd, <HI>What then &s;hould
be the Rea&s;on thereof?</HI> An&s;wer was made,
<HI>That &s;ince the Matter was controver&s;ed in the
Sentence, lea&s;t there &s;hould be Que&s;tion of the
Marriage afterwards, the Earl of</HI> Somer&s;et
<HI>would have the Sentence lying by him under the
Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>ratify'd.</HI> The Arch-bi&s;hop
thought that to be but a weak Hold,
yet charged <HI>Searle</HI> to &s;ee &s;uch an In&s;trument
drawn, and a Certificate &s;hould according|ly
be made. On the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> after, <HI>Bar|ker</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="78">
the Regi&s;ter, cometh to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and
&s;heweth a Form of a Draught in Paper,
how the Certificate &s;hould be return'd in
the Names of all the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;pe|cially
put down. The Arch-bi&s;hop, in the
Reading of it, found five or &s;ix Lines ha|ving
a black Line drawn under them; and
thereupon, the more marking the Words
contained in them, found that which he
liked not. Thereupon he a&s;k'd <HI>Barker,</HI>
<HI>who lined tho&s;e Words? Barker</HI> &s;aid, <HI>He him|&s;elf
did.</HI> The other a&s;ked, <HI>What was the
Rea&s;on of it?</HI> And it was an&s;wer'd, <HI>Becau&s;e
Sir</HI> John Bennet <HI>and &s;ome other of the Doctors
with him had di&s;liked that Sentence.</HI> Quoth
the Arch-bi&s;hop, <HI>And they had Rea&s;on for it:
Who put them fir&s;t in?</HI> Barker &s;aid, <HI>None
but him&s;elf.</HI> Quoth the Arch-bi&s;hop then,
<HI>May not the Certificate &s;tand as well without
tho&s;e Words as with them?</HI> To which <HI>Barker</HI>
an&s;wer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then &s;aid the Arch-bi&s;hop,
<HI>Let them be &s;tricken out.</HI> Here the Regi&s;ter,
with &s;omewhat ado, faintly made An&s;wer,
<HI>That the Commi&s;&s;ioners on the other Side would
by no Means have them out.</HI> The Arch-bi&s;hop
&s;aid, <HI>Then I perceive it is a Device to entangle
us: I am ready to certify the Sentence as the
Writ requireth, but I will none of this.</HI> Bar|ker<HI>,
I am fir&s;t in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and for my
Place &s;ake, I would have looked, that I &s;hould
have been conferr'd withal, what had been fit
to return, and not to have had this Trick put</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="79">
<HI>upon me, that either I mu&s;t certify that which
cro&s;&s;eth my Judgment at the Time of giving
the Sentence, or I mu&s;t be forced not to certify
at all.</HI> So <HI>Barker</HI> departed, and all was
quiet until the <HI>Monday</HI> after; at which
Time the Arch-bi&s;hop was early at
<HI>White-Hall,</HI> the Council &s;itting that Mor|ning.
There, in the waiting Chamber, at
the End of the Privy-Gallery, the Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Litchfield</HI> cometh to him, and &s;aith, <HI>My
Lord, we have receiv'd a Writ of</HI> Certiorari
<HI>out of the Chancery, to certify the Sentence for
the Nullity. Yea,</HI> &s;aith the Arch-bi&s;hop, <HI>and
I am ready to certify it. But,</HI> &s;aith the Bi|&s;hop,
<HI>He who framed the Writ, hath made it</HI>
&s;ub Sigillis ve&s;tris, <HI>and doth not know that
there is a Seal of Office for the Delegates; it
&s;hould have been</HI> &s;ub Sigillo Communi. Be|fore
the Arch-bi&s;hop could reply, in co|meth
the Lord Chancellor, and to him
cometh out of the next Chamber the Lord
Chamberlain; and then tho&s;e two Lords,
together with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI>
drew them&s;elves to a Window, and there
had they &s;ecret Communication about
the altering of the Form of the Writ,
as the Effect declared; for that After|noon,
a Cau&s;e being to be heard touch|ing
<HI>Alimony,</HI> from Sir <HI>Pexal Brocas</HI> to his
Lady; and the Committees in it being the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and Mr. Chancellor of
<PB N="74" REF="80">
the Dutchy, and my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
being Umpire; before Mr. Chancellor was
come, <HI>Bembo,</HI> Deputy to the Clerk of the
Crown, came into the Parlour at <HI>Lambeth,</HI>
and had private Speech with the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Litchfield.</HI> The Arch-bi&s;hop going out into
the Garden, <HI>Litchfield</HI> follow'd him, and told
him, <HI>That Mr.</HI> Bembo <HI>had brought another
Form of a Writ</HI>; and thereupon &s;hewed
him the Words <HI>&s;ub communi &s;igillo.</HI> The
Arch-bi&s;hop bid him do as he thought
good, and withdrew him&s;elf into the low
Stone-Gallery, whither <HI>Litchfield</HI> follow'd
him, and u&s;ed the&s;e Words: <HI>My Lord,
here is a Form of a Certificate, which hath
been thought fit to u&s;e in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my
Lord Chamberlain; and I hear your Grace ta|keth
Exception to &s;ome Things in it.</HI> Then
he pull'd out the very Paper which <HI>Barker</HI>
formerly had &s;hew'd. The Arch-bi&s;hop
an&s;wer'd, <HI>My Lord, have I not Rea&s;on to
take Exception to the&s;e Words, that</HI> po&s;t om|nimodam
Veritatis di&s;qui&s;itionem<HI>,</HI> po&s;t pro|bationes
idoneas &amp; de jure requi&s;itas<HI>, we gave
&s;uch a Sentence? For, to &s;ub&s;cribe this, were
to proclaim my &s;elf a di&s;hone&s;t Man upon Re|cord:
For if the&s;e Things be true, why did I
deny to join in the Sentence?</HI> Quoth <HI>Litchfield,
This here is true; for it cannot be deny'd, but
&s;ome</HI> probationes idoneae<HI>,</HI> &amp; de jure requi&s;i|tae
<HI>were u&s;ed; and we do not &s;ay that all were.</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="81">
The Arch-bi&s;hop an&s;wered, <HI>You &s;hall do
well, therefore, to certify</HI> po&s;t probationes
aliquas<HI>, and I will joyn with you; but as it
&s;tandeth now indefinitely, it will be taken as if
all had been u&s;ed; I pray you therefore to alter
the Certificate, and make Things plain. My
Lord,</HI> quoth <HI>Litchfield, I will deal plainly with
you; becau&s;e the Words were in, and doubt was
made, whether they &s;hould pa&s;s or no: The King's
Maje&s;ty hath been acquainted with the Bu&s;ine&s;s;
and he, by a Letter from Sir</HI> Thomas Lake<HI>, hath
&s;ent Word expre&s;sly, that he will have them in.</HI>
The Arch-bi&s;hop &s;aid, <HI>Let them then certify who
will avow tho&s;e Words, for I cannot conde&s;cend
unto them. And hath not that Per&s;on done a
good Office, who hath informed the King hereof;
that Di&s;traction may &s;till be among the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
and there may never be an End of
Difference.</HI> The Bi&s;hop &s;aid, <HI>My Lord, I
could wi&s;h that you would yield unto the King,
and &s;o give him Satisfaction.</HI> The Arch-bi|&s;hop
an&s;wer'd, <HI>What would you have me do?
I gave the Sentence as I was per&s;waded in Con|&s;cience,
and &s;ince that Time I have been &s;ilent,
and meddle no way in the Matter: I did what
I did upon long Deliberation; and I may not in
Private, upon no Ground &s;ince appearing to
me, cro&s;s that which I have done in Publick.</HI>
It was farther added, <HI>That there was Rea&s;on
to &s;u&s;pect, that they did ill Offices, who held
tho&s;e Things &s;till on Foot: That there never was</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="82">
<HI>any Man, who &s;ought to grace him&s;elf by di&s;|gracing
others, but it met him at the Lane's
End, at one Time or another.</HI> The&s;e Things
pa&s;&s;ed then; and after the Cau&s;e heard be|tween
Sir <HI>Pexal Brocas</HI> and his Wife, the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> &s;aid to the Arch-bi&s;hop
at his Parting, <HI>My Lord, you will give us
leave to certify then as we purpo&s;e?</HI> To which
the Arch-bi&s;hop an&s;wer'd, <HI>Yea, with all
my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, the Arch-bi&s;hop re|member'd,
that by the Carriage of Things
in &s;uch Fa&s;hion as was pretended, he might
be trick'd: For if the Names of all the
Commi&s;&s;ioners were put into the Certifi|cate,
and four of them might certify un|der
a common Seal, it &s;hould not be
known hereafter, but that he and his Fel|lows
concurr'd therein, and that, with the
Words which were excepted again&s;t: He
therefore &s;ent for <HI>Barker,</HI> and in the Pre|&s;ence
of Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> and two Servants,
being Publick Notaries, he expo&s;tulated
with <HI>Barker,</HI> as &s;erving Mens Turns, ra|ther
than caring for Peace; and then pun|ctually
he deliver'd the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>The Writ requireth me to certify the
Sentence, and I am ready to do it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>If the whole Proce&s;s be de&s;ir'd, I
am willing to certify that al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83">
Thirdly, <HI>For the Words in Que&s;tion, be|cau&s;e
they were put in without my Privity, and
they may as well be left out as put in, by your
own Saying, I pray to be forborn for returning
of them.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>I require you to conceal the&s;e
Things as much as you may, that the World
take no new Alarm of any Difference between
the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</HI></P>
<P>The Arch-bi&s;hop &s;pake of returning the
whole Proce&s;s, becau&s;e he had heard, that
at the fir&s;t, it was meant it &s;hould be &s;o;
but Dr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> and, perhaps, &s;ome other of
the Civilians, di&s;&s;uaded that by all Means;
lea&s;t, if the whole were on Record in the
Chancery, every Man that li&s;t, hereafter,
might cen&s;ure that Sentence, and &s;ift
the Grounds whereon the Commi&s;&s;ioners
proceeded; it was good, therefore, to take
away that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When Matters were thus re&s;olv'd, the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> who meant to play
his Prizes in this Service, &s;peaketh to <HI>Bem|bo,</HI>
to draw &s;ome Preface, or Conclu&s;ion, to
add to the Certificate; that it might not
only be &s;ign'd with the great Seal, as af|ter
the Form of an <HI>In&s;peximus</HI>; but that
his Maje&s;ty might add a Confirmation to
it: And when Mr. <HI>Bembo,</HI> as unacquainted
with this Fa&s;hion, did not fit the Bi&s;hop's
Humour, his Lord&s;hip took on him to do
<PB N="78" REF="84">
it him&s;elf. He drew up, therefore, a
&s;trange Writing, as was inform'd by a cre|dible
Per&s;on that &s;aw it, containing bar|barous
Latin, and no good Congruity of
Sen&s;e. But the Matter of it was, that his
Maje&s;ty having the Authority of the Pope
now in him&s;elf, and in <HI>&s;crinio pectoris,</HI> ha|ving
Power to ratify, did, <HI>ex plenitudine
pote&s;tatis,</HI> confirm that Divorce to all In|tents
and Purpo&s;es. In an Evening Dr.
<HI>Martin</HI> was &s;ent for to the Lord Chamber|lain,
and there was the Bi&s;hop with his
Papers. The Doctor, as it hath been ere|dibly
deliver'd, being &s;hew'd that Writing,
and his Opinion thereupon being a&s;k'd,
did utterly di&s;like it, and &s;aid, <HI>That the
King claim'd nothing of the Pope's Power; but
took that as his own, which the Pope had u&s;mp|ed:
That the King had &s;poke before by his
Judges Delegate, and had nothing more to do:
That if the Sentence were not good already, no
Confirmation could make it good.</HI> And when
the Bi&s;hop was earne&s;t in Defence of his
Device, there was a little Heat &s;tricken be|tween
the Doctor and him, &s;o that the&s;e
Words pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;aid Doctor: <HI>You do,
as much as in you lyeth, &s;pit in the Face of the
King our Ma&s;ter, by laying on him all the
Matter; whereas the Scandal that hath already
been, is this, that his Maje&s;ty is &s;aid to deal
&s;o much in the Matter. My Lord, you are to</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="85">
<HI>blame to enter into the&s;e Things without Advice
of Men &s;kilful in the Law: Hath Dr.</HI> Stuart
<HI>or Dr.</HI> Bird <HI>been acquainted herewithal?</HI> The
Bi&s;hop &s;aith, <HI>No; but for this Matter, I
know as much Law at the be&s;t of you all.</HI> Dr.
<HI>Martin</HI> reply'd, <HI>No: Your Lord&s;hip thinketh,
that becau&s;e you have read two or three Chapters
of the Canon-Law about this late Bu&s;ine&s;s, you
know as much as we do, who have &s;pent all our
Lives in that Profe&s;&s;ion: I tell your Lord&s;hip,
I have &s;tudy'd the Law the&s;e two and thirty
Years; and therefore, you &s;hall give me leave to
believe that I know more therein than you can.
I am the King's Advocate, and therefore may
&s;uffer nothing with my Con&s;ent to pa&s;s di&s;ho|nourable
to my Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Conte&s;tations, the Lord
Chamberlain was much troubled, &s;aying,
<HI>What a Matter is this, that Men &s;hould be of
&s;uch contrary Opinions! What &s;hall we do?</HI>
When the Bi&s;hop murmur'd much that his
Conceit was not follow'd, Dr. <HI>Martin</HI> &s;aid
thus: <HI>My Lord, in a Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Impor|tance,
I will not wi&s;h your Lord&s;hip to follow
my &s;ingle Advice, but let this be done; to Mor|row
let Sir</HI> William Button<HI>, in your Lord&s;hip's
Name, come to</HI> Doctors-Commons<HI>; and let
him get together Sir</HI> Daniel Dun<HI>, Dr.</HI> Stuart<HI>,
and Dr.</HI> Bird<HI>, and I will attend them; and
then we will con&s;ult jointly what is fit to be
done.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="86">
This Advice was much liked; and on
the Morrow, being <HI>Friday,</HI> they all a&s;&s;em|bled,
and, for two Hours, all Points were
debated; but the Conclu&s;ion was, <HI>That
there &s;hould be no farther Confirmation: For
this was to proclaim, that the Sentence was de|fective
in it&s;elf, which would make a great
Buzz in the World:</HI> And therefore, the
Coun&s;el was in general, <HI>That too much had
been done, and for the Time to come, the Care
mu&s;t be, how to lay it a&s;leep fairly.</HI></P>
<P>This Re&s;olution being taken, the next
Knack was, that &s;o many of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
as were for the Sentence, &s;hould
be call'd together; and they &s;hould be
made acquainted with this, that the Bi&s;hop
might be fairly put off. On the <HI>Saturday</HI>
Night, therefore, in the Dark, at Sir <HI>Ju|lius
Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Hou&s;e in the <HI>Strand,</HI> met the
Bi&s;hops of <HI>Ely, Litchfield, Roche&s;ter,</HI> the two
Chancellors of the Exchequer and Dutchy,
and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> and well near for an
Hour, they privately debated what they
thought fit, but, as it &s;eemeth, re&s;olv'd as
before, and &s;o departed.</P>
<P>A Friend being the next Day with
the Lady <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and knowing of the Meet|ting,
a&s;ked her, <HI>What about it was?</HI> She
an&s;wer'd, <HI>It is &s;omething about the late Nul|lity;
but what it is, I do not know. It &s;eem|eth,
that they who were the Doers in it, think</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="87"><HI>&s;omewhat is ami&s;s. They &s;uppo&s;e all is not well
about it, and I, for my part, think &s;o al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>A Man would have &s;uppo&s;ed, that all
the&s;e Things &s;hould have contented the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield</HI>; but he was &s;o far in
Love with his own Invention, that yet he
would not be beat off; and therefore, to
merit the more, he once again moveth the
Lord Chamberlain to &s;end to Sir <HI>Francis
Bacon,</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Yelverton,</HI> being of the
King's learned Council, to know their Opi|nion:
Which being done; and they two,
for the Rea&s;ons above named, concurring
with the Civilians: The Bi&s;hop, as it
hath been credibly related, &s;aid of them,
together with the re&s;t, <HI>They are all Fools,</HI>
And &s;o ended this Stratagem; but the
Worker thereof was not yet for an End.</P>
<P>From the Beginning of this whole Que&s;ti|on
of the Nullity, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield</HI>
had carry'd him&s;elf variou&s;ly, &s;ometimes
being vehement in Words, publickly a|gain&s;t
the Separation, and other Times in
Deed, giving Furtherance to it. Many
Speeches he had privately with the Arch-Bi&s;hop,
making &s;hew of much Hone&s;ty and
Re&s;pect to him, which the Arch-bi&s;hop e|ver
warily ob&s;erv'd; thinking, notwith|&s;tanding,
that the&s;e had been Te&s;timonies
of the working of his Con&s;cience, conflict|ing
in it &s;elf, but not re&s;olv'd what to do.
<PB N="82" REF="88">
In the mean Time, from the Court, from
London, and out of the Country, the Arch-|bi&s;hop
was &s;till call'd upon by divers wor|thy
Friends, <HI>That he &s;hould take heed of that
Bi&s;hop; that he was ever, and in all Things
naught: That he did all the wor&s;t Offices that
po&s;&s;ibly he could, and was &s;till &s;tirring the
Coals, to procure to him&s;elf a Reputation;
that he was zealous of the Hou&s;e of</HI> Suffolk.
The Arch-bi&s;hop forgot not tho&s;e many
Warnings, but carry'd him&s;elf very warily
towards him: Yet out of Charity, it &s;till
came in his Mind, <HI>He is a Bi&s;hop, I know no
Evil of him; I ought not to condemn a Man
upon a Generality; I have no particular Proof
of his Mi&s;behaviour in this behalf, although
he dealt ill with the late Lord Trea&s;urer, and
mo&s;t fal&s;ly with the Arch-bi&s;hop</HI> Bancroft <HI>in
his Life-time, and after his Death; and for
that Cau&s;e was dete&s;ted by both of them; yet
an hone&s;t Man may think, that Experience hath
reform'd him, and now he is amended.</HI> Yet it
much affected the Arch-bi&s;hop, that all
Men &s;pake &s;o ill of him; and one Speech of
an old Courtier, a very hone&s;t Knight,
enter'd far with him. For about a Fort|night
before the Marriage, the &s;aid Cour|tier,
&s;peaking privately with the Arch-Bi&s;hop,
among other Words, he us'd this.
<HI>I know not what the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Litchfield
<HI>doth among you; but he hath made a &s;hift</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="89">
<HI>to be taken for a Knave, generally with us
in the Court.</HI> Now, whether the next Prank
will verify &s;o much or no, let the Reader
judge. Eight Days before the Marriage,
on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, that Bi&s;hop com|eth
to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and in private Conference
with the Arch bi&s;hop, he telleth him, <HI>That
out of his Love and Re&s;pect to his Grace, he
was come voluntarily, as of him&s;elf, to know
his Mind about one Matter, and it was this.
On St.</HI> Stephen's <HI>Day,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>the Lord
Chamberlain meaneth to have this great Mar|riage
go forward: Now it may, perhaps, be
de&s;ir'd, that a Licence &s;hould be given by you,
that the Banes may not be a&s;k'd, which if you
like not to grant, I may be the Means to free
you from being mov'd to it.</HI> The Arch-|bi&s;hop
&s;aid, <HI>What have I to do with grant|ing
of a Licen&s;e; it belongeth not to me:
But wherefore &s;hould there be any Need of
a Licen&s;e; the Marriage is intended to be
Publick; Masks and Shews are made for the
&s;ame; all</HI> England <HI>taketh Notice of it, and
therefore it were good, that the Banes were
openly a&s;k'd, as the Manner is of &s;uch Mar|riages
as are made in the King's Chapel. Yea,
the Lady</HI> Elizabeth <HI>her&s;elf, had her Banes
a&s;k'd. My Lord,</HI> &s;aith Litchfield, <HI>there is
&s;ome Cau&s;e why it &s;hould be done without
publi&s;hing the Banes: For peradventure &s;ome
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">dy may &s;tep up, and make a Di&s;turbance.</HI>

<HI>You know what a mad, naked Fellow, came in

if &s;uch a one &s;hould come in now, what a

within him&s;elf, to hear &s;uch a Re|ply,
and thought &s;urely, that it was no

come no &s;uch into the King's Chapel; there
be Doors and Officers to keep &s;uch out. But
if it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, that any would op|po&s;e,
it is be&s;t the Banes be a&s;k'd, for then
there will be &s;ome warning of the Gain-&s;aying;
whereas, otherwi&s;e, if at the Time of the Mar|riage,
one &s;hould &s;uddenly &s;tart up, it would
make a greater Trouble.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding

Litchfield reply'd, <HI>He never granted any, and
he hath no Seal for that Office. It was an|&s;wer'd,
He never granted any, becau&s;e no Body
ever de&s;ir'd it; but the Manner was, that the
Banes were publi&s;h'd. But as for the Seal of

<HI>I have enquir'd of my Officers, and they tell

I know that my Lord of</HI> Bath <HI>hath it under
the Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>exclu&s;ively, to the
Arch-bi&s;hop; &s;o that in direct Words there is
a Re&s;traint, that he may not meddle there.
Yea, but,</HI> quoth Litchfield, <HI>you have an Act
of Parliament, enabling you to grant Di&s;pen|&s;ations
to the King and his Children; and
therefore it belongeth to you.</HI> Said the Arch-bi&s;hop,
<HI>Do not you think that I under&s;tand
the Act of Parliament as well as you?</HI> My
Lord<HI>, Do you think that that Statute was
made for the&s;e ordinary Graces and Di&s;pen|&s;ations?
Why, is not your Lord&s;hip able, with|in
your Dioce&s;s, to grant a Licen&s;e, that a
Marriage may be &s;olemniz'd, and not the Banes
a&s;k'd? Yes,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I may: Nay, every
Arch-deacon may do it within his Juri&s;diction.
Then my Lord,</HI> quoth the Arch-bi&s;hop, <HI>mu&s;t</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="92">
<HI>an Act of Parliament be made to grant the

There is &s;urely &s;ome other Matter in it. But
I marvel, my Lord, that you are now &s;o
earne&s;t for the Arch-bi&s;hop's Licen&s;es, when,
as I have heard, in the Days of my Predece&s;&s;or,
when you were Bi&s;hop of</HI> Roche&s;ter<HI>, you would
not &s;uffer the Arch-bi&s;hop's Licen&s;es to pa&s;s

We&s;tmin&s;ter <HI>that I did &s;trive, not for the
Dioce&s;s of</HI> Roche&s;ter. <HI>And it is true, that
there be Records in that Church, that the
Monks did contend with the King about di|vers
Que&s;tions. I had Rea&s;on therefore, to

an&s;wer'd, <HI>So hath my Lord of</HI> Bath <HI>to &s;tand
for the Rights of the King's Chapel.</HI> The
Arch-bi&s;hop &s;eeing how earne&s;t the Man
was, in &s;o unrea&s;onable a Thing, &s;aid
farther, <HI>My Lord,</HI> you have mine An&s;wer,
but let me now tell you one thing. <HI>It
is &s;ix Weeks agone, that I heard from the
Court, and many Times &s;ince I have had it
reiterated, that &s;uch a Trick &s;hould be put up|on
me: That although it needed not, yet I
&s;hould be mov'd for granting this Licen&s;e, be|cau&s;e
thereby I &s;hould be con&s;train'd, either to
grant it, and &s;o cro&s;s my former Sentence, and
involvedly give my Con&s;ent to the Nullity, or
I &s;hould deny it, and &s;o grate once again up|on</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="93">
<HI>the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure. You &s;ee now I
have given you a fair An&s;wer, which may free
me from both. But, my Lord, I pray God
you do good Offices in this Bu&s;ine&s;s. I fear
you put your &s;elf into many Things, which
may be better forborn. But let me tell you,
there was never any Man, who &s;ought to
rai&s;e him&s;elf by wronging another, but at one
Time or other he had enough of it. It is
now almo&s;t three Months &s;ince this Sentence
is given, and &s;ince that Time, I have not
meddled with the Matter, for offending the
King. I am &s;ilent, and no way oppo&s;e, and
Men have their End; yet cannot I be quiet.
I would have you know, that God beholdeth
the&s;e things, and remembereth them. And for
my Part, I am not blind, I &s;ee well what is
done; and I &s;hall not always be &s;ilent. The
Time will come, that I mu&s;t &s;peak; and it &s;hall
appear I am not Tongue-ty'd.</HI> This made
the Bi&s;hop not &s;o forward as before, but
Occa&s;ion of a farther Speech being offer'd;
the Arch-bi&s;hop went on, and &s;aid, <HI>The
Sentence which I gave, was in the Fear of God,
and according to my Con&s;cience: And if that
had been done, which was convenient, and we
called for, there needed not to have been any
Divi&s;ion in Judgment. For, my Lord, you may
remember when you came to me at</HI> Croydon<HI>,
and brought the&s;e Papers from the King, after
the reading whereof, I &s;lept little that Night,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="94">
<HI>how de&s;irous I was to give his Maje&s;ty Sati&s;|faction;
and therefore pray'd you, fetching out
the Proce&s;s unto you, to tell me whereupon I
&s;hould ground my Sentence. You &s;hew'd me one
Article,</HI> that he had not known her, nor
he thought that he never &s;hould. <HI>I told
you then, Yea, that was for want of Love,
for he &s;aid,</HI> When I came out of <HI>France,</HI> I
lov'd her; I do not &s;o, neither ever &s;hall I.
<HI>It is want of Love.</HI> To this the Bi&s;hop
&s;aid, <HI>Yea, and the Earl added,</HI> That he had
done his Be&s;t oftentimes, Carnally to know
her, but he found an Imperfection in him|&s;elf.
The Arch-bi&s;hop reply'd to this, <HI>Oh,
my Lord! Never &s;ay &s;o; for his Lord&s;hip's
An&s;wers upon his Oath, are to the contrary:</HI>
He found no Defect or Impediment in him|&s;elf.
<HI>And if I &s;hall &s;peak my private Opi|nion,
although I would not have you believe it,
I think the Earl as able a Man for a Wo|man,
as any is in</HI> England. <HI>And I think to
the contrary,</HI> Quoth Litchfield. The Arch-bi&s;hop
went on: <HI>But, my Lord, when your
Lord&s;hip and I had the&s;e Difficulties in our
Mind at</HI> Croydon<HI>, you told me of one thing
which I embrac'd as an Oracle from Heaven.
And that was, that to rid our &s;elves of the&s;e
Di&s;tractions, we had no other Way, but to call
the Earl of E&s;&s;ex again upon his Oath, that &s;o
giving us a fuller An&s;wer, we might either have
good Ground to pronounce for the Nullity, or</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="95">
<HI>Matter to give Rea&s;on why we might not
conde&s;cend unto it. I approv'd this, and you
know how the next Day, in publick Court, it
was mov'd, and my Lords of</HI> Winche&s;ter<HI>,</HI> Ely<HI>,</HI>
Roche&s;ter<HI>, and your &s;elf, gave very good
liking to it; and no Man &s;aid any thing
again&s;t it, except Mr. Chancellor of the Exche|quer,
who &s;oftly &s;pake,</HI> I know not whether
that will be permitted. <HI>But you may re|member,
you were intreated to deliver this to
the King at</HI> Theobalds<HI>, from whom you brought
Word,</HI> That it &s;hould not be granted, be|cau&s;e
the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> being partly pro|vok'd
by his falling out with Mr. <HI>Henry
Howard,</HI> and partly being coun&s;elled by
the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> would &s;peak all
things to hinder the Nullity. My An&s;wer
then was, <HI>That he was to &s;peak upon his
Oath, and we would mo&s;t &s;trictly examine him.</HI>
When that was deny'd, which &s;hould have
led us to the Truth, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I had
never any mind to pronounce for the Se|paration.
The Bi&s;hop &s;eem'd to take no
great Plea&s;ure to hear the&s;e things thus
repeated, but fared, as if he could have
wi&s;h'd, that they all had been forgotten.
The Conclu&s;ion of all was, that the Bi&s;hop
&s;eem'd to be well &s;atisfy'd, that no Licen&s;e
was given, and promis'd the Arch-bi&s;hop,
to take Care that he &s;hould no farther be
troubled with it, a&s;&s;uring him, <HI>That he did</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="96">
<HI>ever good Offices to him, whereof the King could
give Witne&s;s, and would; and he would ever
make the be&s;t of things.</HI> To which the Arch-bi&s;hop
&s;aid, <HI>If he did, he would take it for
a Kindne&s;s at his Hands,</HI> and &s;o he depar|ted.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Day the Banes
were a&s;k'd in the Chapel, and there was
nothing but fair Weather, the Arch-bi&s;hop
attending the King in the Clo&s;et. On the
<HI>Monday</HI> the King went to <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court;
and that Day the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI>
came to <HI>Lambeth:</HI> He told the Arch-bi&s;hop,
that he had a direct Me&s;&s;age unto him from
the King, and that was, That his Maje&s;ty
did much marvel, that he &s;pake not with
him about the Sentence: That the King
expected Satisfaction and Submi&s;&s;ion. His
Lord&s;hip added, That he perceiv'd that the
King had &s;ome Scruple in his Mind, which
he wi&s;h'd &s;hould be remov'd before his go|ing
to the Communion on <HI>Christmas</HI> Day.
The Arch-bi&s;hop knew not that the Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Litchfield</HI> had dealt any Way treache|rou&s;ly
with him, and therefore was con|&s;train'd
to an&s;wer, in general, that he
knew not what to &s;ay to his Highne&s;s.
He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that in giving of
the Sentence he had done his Duty, and
therefore could not tell how to make a
Submi&s;&s;ion where he conceiv'd no Fault.
<PB N="91" REF="97">
If in any Circum&s;tance he had err'd, he
was ready to te&s;tify his Sorrow for it; but
he knew no &s;uch Thing; yet, if his Maje|&s;ty
was di&s;pleas'd at him, to &s;ignify his
Obedience to his King and Sovereign, to
whom he was &s;o much bound, he would
not refu&s;e, if the King were pleas'd to re|&s;train
him of his Liberty, and lay him in
the Tower all the Days of his Life, to
&s;ubmit him&s;elf unto it patiently, without
Murmuring.</P>
<P>Furthermore, he pray'd the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Bath,</HI> and (who, on the Morrow, was to go
to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court) to &s;ignify, humbly to
his Maje&s;ty, That he had nothing in this
World more precious than his Life; and
that he wi&s;h'd, that he had given that
Life as a Redemption, that the King's
Hand had never been in that Bu&s;ine&s;s.
And withal, he &s;aid, that at the coming
of the King, he would attend his Maje|&s;ty.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night, the King came to
<HI>White-Hall</HI>; and on the <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> after
Dinner, my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI> went to the
Court, where they were all bu&s;y about
Plate and Jewels again&s;t the Marriage. Not|with&s;tanding,
he had ha&s;tily Speech of
divers Matters with the King; and in
the End, he &s;aid privately unto his High|ne&s;s,
<HI>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I under&s;tand,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="98">
<HI>by my Lord of</HI> Bath and Wells<HI>, That your
Maje&s;ty expects that I &s;hould give you an Ac|count
about the Matter of the Lord of</HI> E&s;&s;ex,
<HI>and the Lady</HI> Frances<HI>: I can &s;ay nothing more
than this, That I was put into the Commi&s;&s;ion
as a Judge, and at the Time of Sentence, I did
my Con&s;cience; and &s;ince I have not meddled
with the Matter. Yes,</HI> &s;aith the King, <HI>I hear
you deny'd a Licen&s;e to be granted, for not
a&s;king of the Banes; which I wonder you
would do, &s;ince the Sentence was pa&s;s'd. No,</HI>
&s;aid the Arch-bi&s;hop, <HI>I deny'd no Licen&s;e;
but I advis'd, that the be&s;t Cour&s;e was, that the
Banes &s;hould be a&s;k'd according to the Cu&s;tom
us'd in the Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;aid, <HI>That if any Licen&s;e &s;hould
be granted, it belong'd not to me to give it,
but to the Ordinary of the Place, the Dean of
the Chapel, who hath it under your Maje&s;ty's
Great Seal, exclu&s;ive to the Arch-bi&s;hoprick.
Yea,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>My Lord of</HI> Bath <HI>&s;aid
&s;o; but I am told it is otherwi&s;e.</HI> The
Arch-bi&s;hop reply'd, <HI>Nay, it is &s;o in|deed.</HI></P>
<P>And thirdly, &s;aid he, <HI>My An&s;wer was,
That never any of my Predece&s;&s;ors granted
Licen&s;e for any Thing done in the King's
Chapel: I have receiv'd Information &s;o,
from my Officers. It had then been Pre|&s;umption
in me, to attempt that which
belong'd not unto me. This is another</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="99">
<HI>ther Matter,</HI> &s;aith the King, <HI>Were the&s;e your
An&s;wers? I was told otherwi&s;e. But I will
take &s;ome other Time to &s;peak with you.</HI>
The Arch-bi&s;hop, after this, attended half
an Hour, and nothing being &s;aid, he de|parted.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Night, a Friend coming to
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> told my Lord, <HI>That he had been
that Day with the Lord</HI> Knowles<HI>, where he
found, that the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Litchfield <HI>had
exceedingly wrong'd my Lord of</HI> Canterbury:
<HI>For he had reported all the Speech about the Li|cen&s;e,
in a &s;piteful Manner, &s;aid, it was ab&s;o|lutely
deny'd: That the Arch-bi&s;hop gave out,</HI>
That the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was very Potent for
a Woman; and that he intended to que|&s;tion
this new Marriage, at one Time or
other, that it &s;hould never take effect.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, the Gentleman made a great
Stir among them; and the Arch-bi&s;hop
was much blamed, that he would never
make an End: But they were much trou|bled
at it, as fearing them&s;elves, that all
was not &s;ure. <HI>But,</HI> quoth he, <HI>when I had
told them, that this was &s;ome ill Office of the
Bi&s;hop of</HI> Litchfield<HI>, who had every Day new
Inventions to puzzle them, that he might &s;o much
the more indear him&s;elf unto them, by &s;ignify|ing
his Zeal for them; and that I knew how
fairly my Lord of</HI> Canterbury <HI>had an&s;wer'd
him,</HI> (for &s;o indeed he did) <HI>and that he was</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="100">
<HI>&s;o far from di&s;turbing the Marriage, that he
intended to be pre&s;ent at it; they were not
only appea&s;ed, but &s;eem'd much content, that
his Grace would be there: And this I a&s;&s;ure
you to be true.</HI></P>
<P>When the Arch-bi&s;hop heard this, he
was now &s;atisfy'd, that the Man who had
done him all the Wrong, was the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Litchfield</HI>; from whom he re&s;olv'd after|ward
to be very wary how he tru&s;ted him.
Yet, profe&s;&s;ing that he forgave him with
all his Heart, on the <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Day</HI> he at|tended
the King, and receiv'd the Commu|nion
with his Maje&s;ty; and &s;o, coming
Home to Dinner, Sir <HI>Charles Cornwallis</HI>
came along with him. This Gentleman is
one, to whom, for his Love, the Arch-|bi&s;hop
was much beholden; and after
Dinner they grew privately into Speech
of all the&s;e fore-remember'd Stirs; where
the Knight found much Fault that &s;o ma|ny
Tricks were put upon the Arch-bi&s;hop;
blam'd infinitely the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield</HI>;
promi&s;ed to acquaint &s;ome of his great
Friends with his Qualities, and a&s;&s;ured to
make, Things be rightly under&s;tood; and
took away with him that Report, wherein
he &s;eemed much to joy, that the Arch-bi|&s;hop
would be at the Marriage.</P>
<P>On the Morrow, being St. <HI>Steven</HI>'s Day,
the Arch-bi&s;hop went to the Court, atten|ded
<PB N="95" REF="101">
the King to Chapel, went down to the
Marriage, (where, not the King, but the

much Comfort, as being glad, that &s;ince

have had a great Contenti|on
and Deliberation with|in
my &s;elf, in what man|ner
I &s;hould utter my Judg|ment
in this pre&s;ent Cau&s;e,
<PB N="98" REF="103">
&s;ince, after the Speech of tho&s;e Three
who fir&s;t began, &s;o great a Stream and Con|currence
together of the re&s;t, (my Lord
excepted, who &s;poke la&s;t) have given their
Opinions for the annulling of the Marriage.
But yet I hold not my &s;elf concluded thereby,
but that I may declare my Judgment, having
learned that <HI>Suffragia</HI> among Wi&s;emen are as
well <HI>appendenda</HI> and <HI>ponderanda,</HI> as <HI>numeranda:</HI>
And it was no &s;hame for <HI>Phocion</HI> in <HI>Athens,</HI>
upon good Ground, to contradict the whole
City; neither was <HI>Paphnu&s;ius,</HI> in the Coun|cil
of <HI>Nice</HI> the le&s;s re&s;pected, when he
&s;tood again&s;t the whole Synod; nay, it was
his Honour, that by delivering of his Sen|tence,
he altered the Re&s;olution which
that whole A&s;&s;embly had intended to take,
which I freely acknowledge I have no hope
to affect at this Time. And yet, though I
have not that hope, but might very well
&s;pare this labour, yet my Con&s;cience tell|eth
me, that it becometh me to &s;peak in a
Matter of this importance, becau&s;e, not
only, <HI>Deum timeo,</HI> I fear God, which I
doubt not but all of this Company doth;
but I am afraid of God, lea&s;t he &s;hould be
angry with me if in this Ca&s;e I be &s;ilent.
And I think it is expected of me, &s;ince I
am here pre&s;ent, that I &s;hould not &s;it as an
Idol, and only fill a room; for that were to
lay an Imputation on my &s;elf, that I had
undertaken a Cau&s;e, which in publick I
dur&s;t not offer to maintain.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="104">
I mu&s;t acknowledge, that in delivering
of my Mind in this Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o great

as divers of the Judges here: The one is,
That I am no Lawyer; and the other is,
That I am no married Man; by both which
I am di&s;abled, that I cannot &s;peak with
that Confidence concerning &s;ome Particu|lars,
as mo&s;t of you, the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
are able to do; but in lieu thereof, I have
endeavoured to furni&s;h my &s;elf &s;ome other
way concurrent to this Purpo&s;e. As by

with frequent Prayer unto God, that he
would direct me aright; which I have more
begged of God in this Cau&s;e, than ever in
any that was before me in Judgment. And
be&s;ides, I bring with me <HI>animum candidum,</HI>
a Mind devoid of Pa&s;&s;ion, or any Perturba|tion,
which inclineth to no part for fear,
or for favour, for &s;pleen or for hatred:
From which, I thank God, in pronouncing
of Sentence, I ever have been free, re|membring
that Judges are in the Place of
God; and as <HI>Jeho&s;ophat</HI> &s;aid, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.
<HI>Non hominis judicia exercetis &s;ed Domini, &amp;
quicquid judicaveritis in vos redundabit.</HI> He
then who &s;itteth in the Place of God, and
in pronouncing of Sentence will vary from
<PB N="100" REF="105">
Ju&s;tice, he leaveth God, and &s;heweth him|&s;elf
worthy to lye in the flames of Hell,
for abu&s;ing of the Tru&s;t which is commit|ted
unto him, which I hope I &s;hall not do.
And <HI>cui boni?</HI> to what end &s;hould I tran&s;|gre&s;s
in Judgment for either &s;ide, when I
have no rea&s;on to be partial for either, &s;ince
it is indifferent to me in any particular,
whether this Que&s;tion receive one or other
determination.</P>
<P>Where lea&s;t I &s;hould be mi&s;taken, I
think it not ami&s;s, as publickly I have done
divers Times before, to let the World
know what my Judgment is concerning the
Impotency of a Husband towards his Wife.
That &s;ince Marriage in young Couples is
for carnal Copulation and Procreation there|upon,
and that it is the intendment of
tho&s;e which contract Matrimony to receive
Satisfaction in that Kind, that if this No|bleman
be not able to perform tho&s;e mari|tal
Rights unto his Lady, he doth unto her
a very great Inju&s;tice to retain her as his
Wife; and we &s;hall perform a great part of
Injury and Cruelty towards her, if we do
not free her from this Burthen and Yoke.
We are bound in Con&s;cience to do it, &s;ince
it is in truth no Marriage, but a pretended
Matrimony, that Con&s;ummation being
wanting which was one of the fir&s;t Things
in Intention when they two came together:
For <HI>impo&s;&s;ibilitas officii,</HI> by a received Maxim,
<PB N="101" REF="106">
<HI>&s;olvit vinculum Conjugij.</HI> But the Point is,
that before this Separation be pronounced,
it mu&s;t appear unto the Church, that there
is good Cau&s;e for the &s;ame; which mu&s;t not
be upon light Surmi&s;es, or que&s;tionable Sug|ge&s;tions,
but upon evident Declarations and
Proofs, which may give full Contentment
to the Con&s;cience of the Judge. The Mar|riage
was overt and in the Face of the
Church, whereby they were joyned into
one; let the Rea&s;on of Separation be as
clear as that was, if it po&s;&s;ibly may be; or
let it be &s;o apparent, that the Church may
well know, that there is ground to &s;tand
upon for pronouncing of a Nullity. Now
this is it which I doubt will not fall out in
this Ca&s;e of my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; there is
not proof &s;ufficient to inform the Minds
of the Judges that this knot &s;hould be di&s;|&s;olved,
and them&s;elves &s;et at liberty,
the one from the other. And then you
under&s;tand what the general Rule is,
<HI>Quod dubitas ne feceris.</HI> And in this Con|trover&s;y
there &s;eems in my Judgment ma|ny
Rea&s;ons of doubting, that the Separati|on
de&s;ired ought not to be granted. You
&s;hall hear &s;ome few of them.</P>
<P>1. The fir&s;t Scruple which ari&s;eth in my
Mind, is from the uncertainty of that Pro|ceeding,
which we have had in this Bu&s;i|&s;ine&s;s.
For in the handling of it formerly,
we had it propounded, that there mu&s;t be
<PB N="102" REF="107">
a Nullity <HI>propter maleficium ver&s;us hanc.</HI>
That was it which we debated, and for the
which we turned our Books; that the
Coun&s;el for my Lady did &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon,
not naming the Words indeed, but by a Pe|riphra&s;is,
or Circumlocution, de&s;cribing the
&s;ame. And it cannot be forgotten, how
Dr. <HI>Stuard,</HI> being told by one, or more of
the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;itting then in Court,
that his whole Speech did &s;till point out
<HI>maleficium,</HI> he an&s;wered, it is true, that is
it which we intend. The Authorities al|ways
brought out of the Canoni&s;ts were in
direct Terms upon <HI>maleficium,</HI> the Proofs
intended nothing el&s;e. And we all under|&s;tand,
that to have an Impotency unto a
Man's own Wife, and an Ability unto o|ther,
and that incurably, and that for &s;ome
Latent Rea&s;on, which cannot be known, is
the Ca&s;e of <HI>maleficium</HI>; and that is the mat|ter
alledged in the Libel, and whereupon
my Lord is examined. And yet, now &s;ince
we &s;it upon the &s;econd Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>male|ficium</HI>
is di&s;claimed. One
of my Lords<NOTE PLACE="marg">My Lord of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> hath avowed
it, that he di&s;likes that
<HI>maleficium</HI>; that he hath
read <HI>Del-Rio,</HI> the Je&s;uit, writing upon
that Argument, and doth hold him an idle
and fabulous Fellow; that he rather &s;uppo|&s;eth
it to be God's own handy Work, than
any Thing from the Devil. Another of
<PB N="103" REF="108">
my Lords<NOTE PLACE="marg">My Lord of <HI>Ely.</HI></NOTE> hath a&s;&s;ented
thereunto, and <HI>maleficium</HI>
mu&s;t be gone. Now I for
my part will not ab&s;olute|ly
deny, that Witches by God's Permi&s;&s;ion
may have a Power over Men, to hurt all,
or part in them, as by God they &s;hall be li|mitted;
but how &s;hall it appear that this
is &s;uch a Thing in the Per&s;on of a Man?
The Que&s;tion is, <HI>An factum &s;it,</HI> and how
it &s;hall be di&s;covered. But to make it a
Thing ordinary, as the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Writers do
beyond the Seas, I take it to be a Fable,
acknowledging that for Truth, which a Bi|&s;hop
well ver&s;ed in that Argument did late|ly
write, that Maleficiation is the very gar|bage
of Popery; a Thing &s;o ba&s;e, that we
who have learned Chri&s;t aright, &s;hould de|&s;pi&s;e
and contemn, allowing it no place a|mong&s;t
us. Which Cour&s;e it were a &s;hame
if we &s;hould not ob&s;erve, &s;ince the Papi&s;ts
them&s;elves grow very weary of it; and
that even in <HI>France,</HI> where there hath been
more ado with this Maleficiation than in
any other Country; for there the common
Sort at the Time of their Marriages, were
wont to be afraid to have the Words of Con|junction
in Matrimony to be &s;poken aloud,
<HI>Quos Deus conjunxit nemo &s;eparet,</HI> or the Be|nediction
to be publickly given, le&s;t &s;ome
Witch or Sorcerer in the &s;ame In&s;tant
&s;hould tye a knot upon a Point, or play
<PB N="104" REF="109">
&s;ome other &s;orcering Trick, whereby the
new Bridegroom &s;o long as that knot la&s;ted,
&s;hould be di&s;abled from actual Copulation
with her whom he had married. And for
avoiding of that hazard, they had there|fore
their Matrimonies celebrated in the
Night Time, and in &s;ome private Place,
where none came but &s;uch Friends as they
dared to tru&s;t. This Super&s;tition grew &s;o
common, and Men were &s;o abu&s;ed by the
fright that came thereof, that the Prelates
of <HI>France,</HI> about Thirty Years &s;ince, in a
Council at <HI>Rheimes,</HI> made this Decree a|gain&s;t
it. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bochellus</HI> in De|cret. Eccle&s;. Gal|lic. <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>tit.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 176. <HI>Anno</HI> 1583.</NOTE><HI>Peccare graviter

of <HI>maleficium ver&s;us hanc.</HI> So that
what &s;hould I think of this Ca&s;e of my
Lords, which is built on &s;uch a Foundation
as no Man will &s;tand to? We are on it, and
off it, and avow it we dare not, yet fly
from it we will not. This moveth Scruple
in me, how I &s;hould a&s;&s;ent to that whereof
I can learn no certainty from the Council of
my Lady, nor from you that be the Judges,
who &s;peak for this Nullity: I dare not re&s;t
my Building on &s;uch a &s;andy Foundation.</P>
<P>2. Another Matter which troubleth my
Mind, is the Novelty of that which is now
&s;et on Foot; a Thing unheard of in our
Church, and unknown in our Kingdom.
We have many Stories, Old and New, of
Things done in this Land; we have Regi|&s;ters
extant in every Dioce&s;e; we have Acts
and Records which &s;pecify tho&s;e Accidents
<PB N="106" REF="111">
which have fallen out in the Days of our
Fore-fathers. I have cau&s;ed &s;earch in ma|ny
Places to be made, and &s;o I know have
&s;ome of you, the Commi&s;&s;ioners; and I
have called upon you for the &s;ame, but I
can have no Precedent of any &s;uch Exam|ple
that hath pa&s;&s;ed in our Kingdom. No
Memory of Man can expre&s;s unto me the
Name of that Per&s;on, who&s;e Marriage was
annull'd for Impotency towards his Wife,
when he found an Ability of carnal Copu|lation
with any other Woman. It is this
Year, 1613. that hath &s;et Abroad this pre|&s;ent
Imagination, for the former Ages
knew it not. It is &s;afe walking in the Ways
which are treaded out unto us. We have
great Rea&s;on for our doings in the&s;e Human
Actions, when we do tho&s;e Deeds which
formerly were done by our Predece&s;&s;ors. I
have had many worthy Men, which have
gone before me in the Place which I now
hold, Men learned, Men judicious, great
di&s;coverers of Impo&s;tures; Men that have
done great Services for the Nation where we
live; but of them never any had &s;uch a
Ca&s;e before them, they never gave Sen|tence
for a Nullity of Marriage upon &s;uch
an inability. I know not whether it be a
happine&s;s or unhappine&s;s, that I mu&s;t be
the fir&s;t to &s;it in a Commi&s;&s;ion for determi|ning
&s;uch a Controver&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="112">
I know to meet with this Objection, it is
whi&s;pered &s;ometimes, that there is an Ex|ample,
and that is <HI>Bury</HI>'s Ca&s;e, which is
urged as a Precedent unto this now in Que|&s;tion.
But indeed, that is no Pattern of this,
the di&s;&s;imilitude is great between the one
Ca&s;e and the other, for <HI>Bury</HI> had his Stones
&s;tricken off with an Hor&s;e, that nothing
but a little part of one of them remained.
I will read you the very Ca&s;e, which if any
Man doubt of, &s;hall be avowed unto him.
Thus then it doth follow.</P>
<P><HI>John Bury,</HI> E&s;quire, was lawfully &s;ei&s;ed
in his Demeanes as of Fee, of, and in di|vers
Mannors, Lands and Tenements, with|in
the County of <HI>Devon.</HI> The &s;aid <HI>John
Bury,</HI> did the 20th Day of <HI>November,</HI> in
the fir&s;t Year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> marry one
<HI>Willimot Gifford,</HI> and they lived together
Three Years; and the &s;aid <HI>Bury</HI> could not
<HI>carnaliter cogno&s;cere dictam Willimotam.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, <HI>viz.</HI> the 17th of <HI>May</HI> 1561,
the &s;aid <HI>Willimot</HI> called the &s;aid <HI>Bury</HI> before
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Judge, and charged him
to be <HI>impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta</HI> Wil|limota,
<HI>propter vitium perpetuum, &amp; incura|bile
impedimentum ad generationem, &amp; ejus
inhabilitatem,</HI> &amp;c. and thereupon de&s;ired
to be divorced, In the Proceeding before
the Judge, it was proved by divers Witne&s;|&s;es,
of which two were Phy&s;icians, that
the &s;aid <HI>Bury</HI> had but one little Stone, and
<PB N="108" REF="113">
that no bigger than a Bean. It was al&s;o
depo&s;ed by divers Matrons, that the &s;aid
<HI>Willimot Gifford</HI> remained a Virgin, and
incorrupt; and the &s;aid <HI>Bury</HI> confe&s;&s;ed no
le&s;s: Upon which Proof, and Confe&s;&s;ion
of <HI>John Bury,</HI> the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Judge pro|nounced
Sentence of Divorce, and did
thereby &s;eparate them.</P>
<P>Afterward the &s;aid <HI>John Bury</HI> took to
Wife one <HI>Philip Monjoy,</HI> his fir&s;t Wife,
<HI>Willimot Gifford,</HI> being then alive; and the
&s;aid <HI>Philip</HI> had a Son in the Time of their
continuing together, <HI>John Bury</HI>'s fir&s;t Wife
being alive.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the &s;aid <HI>Willimot</HI> being &s;till
living, the &s;aid <HI>Monjoy,</HI> of her own ac|cord,
without any Sentence of Divorce,
for&s;ook the &s;aid <HI>John Bury,</HI> and married one
<HI>Langeden,</HI> with whom &s;he continued. The
&s;aid <HI>John Bury,</HI> and his fir&s;t Wife <HI>Willimot</HI>
died, the &s;aid <HI>Monjoy</HI> and <HI>Langeden</HI> then li|ving,
married together.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is, Whether <HI>John Bury,</HI>
being divorced from <HI>Willimot Gifford</HI> for
Impotency, the &s;econd Marriage, &s;olemni|zed
between the &s;aid <HI>John Bury,</HI> and <HI>Mon|joy,</HI>
during which Time the I&s;&s;ue Male was
born, be in Law a Marriage or not.</P>
<P>It appeareth by the Proce&s;s made in the
Cau&s;e, and the Words of the Sentence
grounded upon the &s;ame Proce&s;s, that the
fir&s;t Marriage was pronounced to be void,
<PB N="109" REF="114">
<HI>Propter defectum &amp; vitium te&s;ticulorum,</HI>
which made the &s;aid <HI>John Bury, impoten|tem
&amp; ineptum ad actum generandi, &amp;
coitum conjugalem.</HI> And &s;o in all Re&s;pects,
this &s;econd Marriage with <HI>Monjoy</HI> is void,
and of no effect: For either this Cau&s;e of
the Di&s;&s;olution of the fir&s;t Matrimony is
true, which is always to be pre&s;umed, un|til
the contrary do appear, and then the
&s;ame Cau&s;e doth make the &s;econd Mar|riage
void al&s;o; or el&s;e, if it any ways ap|pear,
this Cau&s;e of the Di&s;&s;olution of the
fir&s;t Marriage to be fal&s;e; <HI>Et Eccle&s;ia erat
decepta, quia &s;atis potens ad generandum, &amp;

fir&s;t Marriage is good, in Law, <HI>&amp; debet re|dire
ad priora connubia:</HI> And &s;o the &s;econd
Marriage is utterly void.</P>

<P>Whether this be true or no, I appeal to
Dr. <HI>Stuard,</HI> who is here in Pre&s;ence, and
of Coun&s;el for my Lady, who, I know,
will affirm it, becau&s;e, not long &s;ince, be|ing
asked by me of it, he confe&s;&s;ed the
&s;ame. And here is Dr. <HI>Farrand</HI> now of
<PB N="110" REF="115">
Coun&s;el for my Lord, who was u&s;ed&mdash;for
his Advice in this Ca&s;e of <HI>Bury</HI>; and Dr.
<HI>Hone</HI> is yet living, who can te&s;tify the
&s;ame. For I will &s;uppo&s;e, that a Man can|not
forget &s;uch a famous Ca&s;e as that was,
wherein him&s;elf was employ'd; but if all
the&s;e were dead, I know where Records,
be, which &s;till will continue. If this then
were the Matter in Que&s;tion touching <HI>Bury,</HI>
<HI>defectus te&s;ticulorum,</HI> what is this to the
great Controver&s;y now depending before
us? And if this be the only Precedent, that
&s;hould be the Inducement, that the Sen|tence
to be given in this Cau&s;e is not new,
but the like hath been heard of before; I
am where I was: We are now to act a No|velty,
a thing &s;trange, and unheard of in
this Church of <HI>England,</HI> whereof let other
Men be the Managers, I may have no
hand in it.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be &s;aid, that in &s;ome
other Countries, and e&s;pecially in <HI>France,</HI>
the&s;e things are well known, and the Ex|amples
of one Kingdom, e&s;pecially being
&s;o near unto us, may be an Inducement for
us to do the like, &s;ince the Rea&s;on is the
&s;ame. My An&s;wer thereunto is, That I
that live in <HI>England,</HI> am to frame my &s;elf
to tho&s;e things, which I find in the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> whereof I &s;ee no rea&s;on, but
there &s;hould be as great E&s;teem, as of any
Church in the World. In the Days of our
<PB N="111" REF="116">
Fore-fathers, as our Nation was held a ve|ry
noble Nation, &s;o was the Church of
<HI>England</HI> held a very famous Church. <HI>Eccle|&s;ia
Anglicana,</HI> as might ea&s;ily be &s;hewed
out of <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> and by divers things
in &s;ome later general Councils, did carry
a greater Sway. And why &s;hould we at
this time, in any thing, yield unto any
Church in the World, &s;ince it is a thing
well known, that the Knowledge of Divi|nity
doth abound here, beyond all other
Nations? and Men of this Land have beat
down the Power of the Pope, and made e|vident
divers Que&s;ions in Matters of The|ology,
beyond all the Parts of Chri&s;ten|dom!
But beyond this, I do know, that
the Cu&s;toms of Churches, even by the De|termination
of the Pope him&s;elf, ought to
be the Rule of Judgment in this Nature.
We have a famous Place inter&s;erted into
the Body of the Law, written by Pope <HI>A|lexander</HI>
the 3d. unto the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Amiens</HI>
in <HI>France.</HI> It is worth your hearing; <NOTE PLACE="marg">De frigidis &amp; maleficiatis, cap. 2. in Supple|mento.</NOTE><HI>Quod

By this we do find, that the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf doth grant no Separations in
Matters of Matrimony, where the Church
of <HI>France</HI> doth; and if the Pope permit in
<HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, that a Divorce &s;hould be
made, it is but a Toleration, and not this
neither, but where it is <HI>con&s;uetudo generalis
Eccle&s;iae Gallicanae</HI>; which if you will apply
unto this Cau&s;e in Que&s;tion, you mu&s;t &s;hew
me, that in <HI>England</HI> it hath been a general
Cu&s;tom, that a Nullity in Marriage
may be pronounced <HI>propter impotentiam
ver&s;us hanc</HI>; which if you cannot &s;hew,
as indeed you cannot, nor give any true
Example, that ever hath been of any &s;uch
Separation within this Church; I may both
in Law and Con&s;cience conclude, that I
dare not introduce any Novelty, and &s;o
con&s;equently pronounce for the Nullity of
<PB N="113" REF="118">
this Marriage. Many things are done in
<HI>France,</HI> whereof if we in <HI>England</HI> had the
Examination, we &s;hould peradventure find
the Fact different from that which they
conceiv'd; or if we agree in the Fact, we
&s;hould give another Sentence. It is not
unknown how, within the Space of one
Year, there hath been much a-do in <HI>France,</HI>
about two Women, <HI>Magdalen</HI> and <HI>Louy&s;e,</HI>
pretended to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a great ma|ny
Devils, and how <HI>Verrine,</HI> a principal Spi|rit
in one of them, hath avowed and main|tained
the Ma&s;s, Invocation of Saints, Ado|ration
of Images, and a great many other
Points of the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of Popery; and a
Book hereof hath been printed and reprint|ed
in <HI>Paris,</HI> with Approbation of the State,
and Allowance of learned Men; in which
the Church of <HI>England</HI> would certainly
di&s;&s;ent, and proclaim the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s to
be but an Impo&s;ture; as the very like was
in the Days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when the
Devils of <HI>Denham</HI> were &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s
<HI>Sarah Williams</HI> and her Si&s;ter, and &s;ome o|ther
Per&s;ons; and much a-do was made of
it, and divers fond People believing
tho&s;e Knacks, turn'd Papi&s;ts thereupon;
yet the I&s;&s;ue of all was, that it proved no
better than a &s;hameful Delu&s;ion, and a
great abu&s;ing of credulous and light-belie|ving
Per&s;ons.</P>

3. But now to proceed farther; if it &s;hall
be &s;aid, It is not the Novelty, nor the
Want of Cu&s;tom here in <HI>England,</HI> which
&s;hould prejudice the Truth; <HI>valeat veritas,</HI>
where&s;oever or when&s;oever it appears:
The Proofs are evident whereupon we do
&s;tand, and that will enforce the Sentence.
My An&s;wer thereunto is, let that be made
manife&s;t, and clear and per&s;picuous, unto
the Con&s;cience of an under&s;tanding Man,
and I &s;hall concur with you; but how &s;hall
I find this in a Matter of this Quality?
Becau&s;e it is nothing el&s;e but Truth which
we do aim at, it were fit that all Probati|ons,
if not which are po&s;&s;ibly, yet at the
lea&s;t which rea&s;onably may be had, &s;hould
be got together to enforce a Conclu&s;ion of
this Con&s;equence. My Books tell me, <HI>In
valore matrimonii inve&s;tigando quaecun&abque; pro|bationes
po&s;&s;ibiles adhibendae &s;unt, &amp; potius de|bent
e&s;&s;e &s;uperfluae qu&agrave;m diminutae.</HI>
It is <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 25.</NOTE> <HI>It is the
Honour of a King to find out a
thing.</HI> And wherein can Judges be&s;tow
their Time better in a Point of Difficulty,
than to &s;earch and &s;earch again, by all ho|ne&s;t
and good Means, to know what is the
Bottom of that which lieth &s;ecret, that &s;o
they may &s;atisfy their own Con&s;cience, and
the Con&s;cience of others, in the Sentence
which they give, and leave no kind of
Scruple, which may trouble their own
<PB N="115" REF="120">
Thoughts? Whether the&s;e things have
been done in this pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, I appeal to
your own Con&s;ciences; whether the Wri|ters
do not mention divers things; whether
the Council for my Lord have not &s;poke
of &s;undry Matters; whether we that be the
Judges, have not thought of divers Cour|&s;es
convenient to be held; of all which, no
Piece or Parcel hath been permitted unto
us. The Proofs then which we have had,
do ari&s;e only out of the Depo&s;itions, and if
there be not Proof &s;ufficient, where &s;hall
we &s;eek for it? Let us then con&s;ider them.
I will tell you my Opinion of them. I find
nothing in them all, which is not in Sub|&s;tance
contained in the An&s;wers of my
Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; a noble Per&s;onage &s;aith,
that in the hearing of divers things, the
Earl hath &s;aid, that he was not able to
know his Lady carnally; the Earl think|ing
this to be true. But this is but a Rela|tion
of Wonder &s;poken extrajudicially;
and therefore for the under&s;tanding of the
Truth therein, we are to have Recour&s;e
unto that, which by the &s;aid Earl is judi|cially
depo&s;ed. Divers Witne&s;&s;es do &s;peak,
that the Earl and the Lady have lived and
lain together for divers Years, my Lord
doth acknowledge it in his An&s;wer; the
Matrons and Mid-wives do declare, that
in their Judgment, my Lady is a Virgin,
and therefore that &s;he was never known
<PB N="116" REF="121">
carnally by the Earl; him&s;elf confe&s;&s;eth
that he did never know her. So that now,
all in Sub&s;tance depending upon his Lord|&s;hip's
An&s;wer, it ought to be our Labour
to &s;can that exactly, and to judge of it
circum&s;pectly. Doth not he then &s;ay, <HI>in
re&s;pon&s;ione ad quartum</HI>; that tho' divers
times, in the fir&s;t Year of their Cohabita|tion,
he did attempt to know her (which
divers times may be twice or thrice, and
no more) yet in the two latter Years, he did
never attempt it? But doth he not &s;ay plain|ly,
<HI>in re&s;pon&s;ione ad tertium</HI>; that &s;ince the
time of his Marriage, he had not, nor
hath any Sickne&s;s or Impediment, to hin|der
him, but that he might have had, and
may have carnal Knowledge with a Wo|man.
This is for the General, that he
hath no Impediment; but <HI>in re&s;pon&s;ione ad
quintuni,</HI> doth he not de&s;cend more parti|cularly
unto his own Lady; that it is true
that he did never carnally know the &s;aid
Lady <HI>Frances?</HI> Mark now what followeth;
but that to the Act of carnal Copulation,
he did not find any Defect in him&s;elf. In|deed
he was not able to penetrate into her
Body; but he layeth the Faults of that up|on
her, as may be &s;een in his An&s;wer unto
the 7th Article. And it may not be forgot|ten,
that in the End of the An&s;wer to the
4th Article, he &s;aith, that &s;ometimes &s;he
refu&s;ed him; the&s;e things are evident, and
<PB N="117" REF="122">
cannot be denied. The only Matter which
maketh &s;hew again&s;t this, is, that he ac|knowledgeth
that he hath lain by her, and
hath had no Motion to have carnal Know|ledge
of her; but e&s;pecially, that in the
End of his An&s;wer unto the 6th Article;
and believeth he never &s;hall. The&s;e Words
are the Shield and Buckler of the contra|ry
part; but how ea&s;ily do they vani&s;h a|way,
or fall to the Ground! For I appeal
unto you all, who were pre&s;ent at the Ex|aminations
(and tho&s;e were ten of us in
Number, who now &s;it here pre&s;ent) whe|ther
the Earl did not openly &s;ubjoin that
to his An&s;wer; <HI>When I came out of</HI> France,
<HI>I did love her, but I do not &s;o now, nei|ther
ever &s;hall I.</HI> I appeal unto the Con|&s;cience
of you all, except my Lord of
<HI>Winton,</HI> and my Lord of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> who
were not then Commi&s;&s;ioners, whether
this be &s;o or no; here then is the Matter,
it is the Want of Love, which re&s;traineth all
Motions of carnal Concupi&s;cence, and not
any Impotency; it is <HI>defectus voluntatis,</HI> and
not <HI>defectus pote&s;tatis.</HI> Let Di&s;contentment
be removed, and there will be an End of
all the Inability: Married Men be&s;t
know the&s;e things; but out of common
Rea&s;on, there can be no great Longing,
where there is no great Liking; many
things they &s;ay fall out between Man and
Wife, that for &s;ome good Space of time,
<PB N="118" REF="123">
there is no carnal Conjunction, and yet no
Impotency concluded thereby may be. The
Ca&s;e is famous of <HI>Pulcheria,</HI> Si&s;ter unto the
Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the younger, who having
vowed Virginity, was notwith&s;tanding af|terward,
for great Rea&s;on of State, thought
fit to be marry'd unto <HI>Martianus,</HI> who
thereupon was cho&s;en Emperor; &s;he would
not conde&s;cend thereunto, till &s;he had Pro|mi&s;e
from him, that her Virginity &s;hould
be pre&s;erved, and with &s;uch a Promi&s;e he
did marry her, &s;o that they lived toge|ther
in Shew as Man and Wife; but indeed
as a Brother and a Si&s;ter. Our Stories do
make mention, that he who was called Saint
<HI>Edward</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> I mean King <HI>Edward</HI>
the Confe&s;&s;or, did marry a Lady, the
Knowledge of who&s;e Body he never had,
neither did this wedded Couple ever en|deavour
to break their Virginity. The
Writers do declare no other Rea&s;on hereof,
but that they had an Opinion, that to live
in Virginity, was the more meritorious, ac|cording
to the Super&s;tition of tho&s;e times.
Now were it not a &s;trange Argument, to
conclude in this manner, that becau&s;e <HI>Mar|tianus</HI>
had not conjugal Copulation with
<HI>Pulcheria,</HI> therefore he was a Man impo|tent;
or, becau&s;e King <HI>Edward</HI> had not
carnal Knowledge of his Wife, therefore
he could not know her. I know the Cir|cum&s;tances
of this pre&s;ent Que&s;tion do
<PB N="119" REF="124">
differ from tho&s;e, but the Ground of the
Argument is the &s;ame. Want of Act up|on
private Rea&s;on, will never enforce a
Want of Power. And this is our Ca&s;e, as
I under&s;tand it, which maketh me unwil|ling
to con&s;ent to this Nullity.</P>
<P>4. There followeth now another Argu|ment,
which I &s;hall deliver briefly. We
have always agreed, that the Chapter in
the Law, which containeth our Ca&s;e, is
the Chapter <HI>Litera de frigidis &amp; malefici|atis</HI>;
for if it be not there, it is no where
to be found. When we have deliver'd ma|ny
things appertaining to this Cau&s;e out
of the be&s;t Writers of the former Ages, or
of our own time, as that my Lord &s;hould
be in&s;pected, or that Phy&s;icians &s;hould u&s;e
their Art to di&s;cern and remove Impoten|cy,
if any were to be found, or that Fa&s;t|ing,
Prayer, and Alms &s;hould be exerci|&s;ed
to over-come this Evil, and divers other
Points of like Nature; it hath &s;till been
an&s;wered to us, to &s;ay the Interpreters,
but it is not in the Law; or it is in the De|crees
which bind not, but it is not in the
Decretals; or it is a Council and Exhorta|tion;
but it is no Mandate or Injunction.
I now therefore mention &s;ome things, which
is in the Law, and in the very Body of this
Law, and it is the Pope's Mandate; and
that is, that my Lord &s;hould have given
his <HI>juramentum cum &s;eptima manu,</HI> as well as
<PB N="120" REF="125">
my Lady; for Want whereof, the whole
Proceeding is annullated. This is the
Pope's Commandment, <HI>Quocirca manda|mus,</HI>
and it requireth the Oath of both, <HI>ip|&s;is
cum &s;eptima propinquorum manu firmanti|bus
juramento, &s;e commi&s;ceri carnaliter ne|quivi&s;&s;e,</HI>
then <HI>proferatis divortii &s;ententiam
inter eos.</HI> This is a thing &s;o clear, that
when on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t, by chance, there
fell mention of it; the Coun|cil
for my Lady<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. Stuard, Dr. Byrde.</NOTE> were &s;o far
from giving An&s;wer to it, that
to &s;peak plainly, they &s;tood as
Men bla&s;ted or blighted with a Lightning,
and knew not which way to turn them; as
was manife&s;t not only unto us, but to all
the Standers by; which I do not utter to
do them any wrong, for they are worthy
Men, both learned and faithful to the Cau&s;e
which they undertake; but the Note is,
that this Objection can receive no true An|&s;wer.
I know, that &s;ince that time, there
hath been Labour made, to give a Salve to
this Sore, but no Man's Wit can do it. I
&s;aid, and &s;ay &s;till, that no Man's Loquence,
neither any Man's Eloquence, can per&s;wade
me, that <HI>ip&s;is firmantibus juramento</HI> is of the
&s;ingular Number. I know there hath been
tumbling and turning of Books, to find
&s;ome Shew to meet with this Objection,
but nothing can be found, which will hold
out this Water. The Proceeding there|fore
<PB N="121" REF="126">
doth appear to be unperfect and de|fective
in that, which is mainly required by
the Law, which makes me to conclude in
this fa&s;hion again&s;t &s;ome unperfect Speech
touching my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; his affirming
or denying of his own Inability towards my
Lady; that either he doth confe&s;s it or de|ny
it: If he do acknowledge it, where is then
his Oath <HI>cum &s;eptima Manu,</HI> which the Law
impo&s;eth? If he do deny it, where is then
your Proof of his Inability, &s;ince you
ground the whole Sub&s;tance of the Nullity
upon his Lord&s;hip's An&s;wer, <HI>That he could
not know her carnally.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t yet crave Patience to go a little far|ther.
One other Exception which I take unto
this Nullity, is the manner of the Sentence,
which by us is to be given, which hath ever
been re&s;olved &s;hould be in general, not ex|pre&s;&s;ing
any Rea&s;on particular wherefore
we do give it. To &s;ay that my Lord is <HI>im|potens
in genere ver&s;us hanc,</HI> and not to tell
wherein, is to propound a Riddle to the
World, which no Man under&s;tandeth. It
were a &s;trange Thing in Learning, to &s;ay,
that &s;uch a Creature is Animal, and not to
tell whither it be a Man, or a Hor&s;e, or a
Fi&s;h, or a Bird. And although it hath been
&s;aid, and &s;trongly main|tain'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Julius Cae&s;ar, Sir Daniel Dun.</NOTE>
<HI>That it is enough in
a Sentence to pronounce a
Thing in general, and that</HI><PB N="122" REF="127">
<HI>the Judge is bound to give no Rea&s;on of it</HI>;
yet I would be glad to know whether, how|&s;oever
I will conceal the particular Rea&s;on
from the Hearers or Standers by, yet were it
not fit, that I who am the Judge, and mu&s;t
give the Sentence, or at lea&s;t con&s;ent unto
it, &s;hould know the Ground whereupon I
do give it. Give me leave to &s;peak my
Con&s;cience, I think &s;uch a Sentence, that
<HI>propter latens aliquod impedimentum,</HI> which is
<HI>perpetuum &amp; incurabile ver&s;us hanc,</HI> is nothing
but a device to &s;erve a pre&s;ent Turn, which
we mu&s;t deliver in &s;uch ob&s;cure Words, to
blind Po&s;terity that comes after, and to a|mu&s;e
tho&s;e which will inquire into it, as if
we had known &s;omething which we held
not fit to utter, when in Truth we know
nothing. I find the Texts of the Law do
&s;till &s;et down the Rea&s;on, and give a Ca&s;e
particular, as Frigidity, or Section, or un|fitne&s;s
of the generative Part, or &s;ome &s;uch
other Matter; but for an Inability, <HI>propter
latens impedimentum,</HI> my dulne&s;s is &s;uch,
that in the whole Book I cannot di&s;cover it:
And it is a My&s;tery that cannot enter into
me, how a Man &s;hould be potent unto
other Women, and impotent to his Wife,
if it be not in Ca&s;e of Phren&s;y, which is not
<HI>latens impedimentum,</HI> and which al&s;o find|eth
<HI>lucida intervalla.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. Litterae.</NOTE> It
was the A&s;&s;ertion of him
in the Law, <HI>That he did not</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="128">
<HI>know his Wife, but that he had a Power to know
other Women.</HI> But what wi&s;e Man doth be|lieve
him? Or what is there in the Text
which doth declare it to be true? I will end
this Point with that of our Saviour in the
29th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> That there are three
Sorts of Eunuchs, or Men unfit to mar|ry;
the one is of God's making, the &s;e|cond
is of Mens making, and the third is
of their own making. The fir&s;t are they
that are pa&s;t from their Mother's Belly, who
either are <HI>frigidi,</HI> or &s;uch as have not Mem|bers
fit for Generation, or &s;ome apparent
Debility. The &s;econd are tho&s;e who are
ca&s;trated by Men, or by &s;ome violence have
that hindred in them, whereunto by Nature
they are fit in re&s;pect of Procreation. I will
not here di&s;pute that idle <HI>Maleficium,</HI> be|cau&s;e
your &s;elves are flown from it. The
third hath no coherence with this Noble|man.
Let me know then, in which of the
former two you do place it. Is he pa&s;t
from his Mother's Womb? why then do
you give him leave to marry again? that
he who hath deluded and fru&s;trated one,
may al&s;o delude another. If he be in the
&s;econd Rank, why do you not tell us what
the Violence is which he hath &s;u&s;tained
from Men, or from any other Creature.
Let us have, I pray you, &s;ome kind of Sa|tisfaction,
and let not this Aenigma in gene|ral
blind us, lea&s;t the World &s;hould &s;ay,
<PB N="124" REF="129">
that wilfully we &s;hut our Eyes again&s;t the
Truth.</P>
<P>6. One Rea&s;on I have more, why I yield not
to this Nullity, and then I have done. It is
drawn from the Inconveniencies which will
follow thereupon, if we di&s;&s;olve the Matri|mony
in &s;uch Ca&s;e as is now de&s;ired. I
look fir&s;t on the detriment and harm which
will follow, if the Marriage do continue in
force, and in vigour, and I do find, that all
the inconvenience doth redound but to one
Per&s;on. Between a Lady and her Husband
there is &s;ome di&s;contentment, which Time
and God's Grace may ea&s;ily remove: There
is then an end of that Controver&s;ie. Or if
the di&s;agreement &s;hall never be appea&s;ed,
it is no more but one Lady doth want that
Solace which marital Conjunction would
afford unto her; which many a good Wo|man
is enforced to endure, and yet com|mits
no Sin, neither labours to violate the
Laws of the Church: For &s;uppo&s;e the
Husband be &s;ick of &s;ome long Di&s;ea&s;e, or
langui&s;hing Weakne&s;s, mu&s;t not the Wife
&s;u&s;tain it with patience and quietne&s;s? Sup|po&s;e
the Husband be Captive in &s;ome For|reign
Nation, or Pri&s;oner in his own Coun|try,
whereby occa&s;ion of marital Comple|xion
is taken from the Wife, no Divine
will pronounce, that a Separation is in this
Ca&s;e to be &s;ought. Let a Woman do that
in Mode&s;ty which others are inforced to do
<PB N="125" REF="130">
out of Nece&s;&s;ity; and let her expect God's
lei&s;ure, in Fa&s;ting and in Prayer, and in o|ther
Humiliation. This is all the Inconve|nience
which ari&s;eth to one Per&s;on, if &s;he
have not the Performance of conjugal Duty.</P>
<P>But look on the other &s;ide, what are the
Incongruities, or rather Ab&s;urdities which
will ea&s;ily follow, if &s;uch Di&s;&s;olutions of
Marriages be permitted. I will name only
two. The fir&s;t is the hazard of violating
and annulling of Marriage by an ordinary
Practice; for if the Gap be open, who will
not run in: And the Judge mu&s;t di&s;pen&s;e
the Law indifferently to all, if the Proofs
be accordingly; for we may not &s;ay, that
it is for noble Per&s;onages, and great Peers
in the State, and not for others of inferiour
Rank. What&s;oever Couple therefore have no
Children, and live di&s;contented, come pre|&s;ently
to take part of this general Jubilee:
And, albeit they know in their Con&s;ciences,
that it which they attempt is unlawful; yet
to &s;atisfy their Fancy, they will collude the
one with the other, and enter a Pro&s;ecuti|on
&s;ecretly agreed upon, how&s;oever in o|pen
&s;hew they &s;eem to differ the one from
the other: And who can doubt, but for
Money or Favour, they may procure Wit|ne&s;&s;es,
and others who are to be u&s;ed by
the formality of the Law, to te&s;tify and
depo&s;e &s;o much as &s;erves the Turn. By
which means we are at a fair pa&s;s, when
<PB N="126" REF="131">
not only the Marriage Bed &s;hall be defiled,
and Adulteries made frequent, which is a|gain&s;t
the &s;econd Table of the Law, but
Perjury &s;hall be committed, and God's
Name taken in vain, which is repugnant
unto the fir&s;t Table.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Inconvenience is the Danger,
lea&s;t both Parties which are freed from
their Matrimony, &s;hould divers Years after
be returned to it again, when perhaps the
Husband by a &s;econd Wife hath Children,
and the Wife by a &s;econd Husband hath
&s;tore of I&s;&s;ue al&s;o; for there is no doubt in
the Law, but if a Man &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>frigi|dus,</HI>
and therefore divorced, &s;hall after|wards
Marry, and by begetting of Children
&s;hew him&s;elf not to be impotent, but apt
for Generation, this Man is to be taken
from his &s;econd Woman, and returned to
his fir&s;t Wife, and the Woman for who&s;e
Marriage a Nullity was pronounced in re|&s;pect
of the In&s;ufficiency of her Mate, mu&s;t
be now taken from her &s;econd Companion,
and returned to the fir&s;t. Of this the Rea|&s;on
is apparent, <HI>quia decepta e&s;t Eccle&s;ia,</HI>
they adjudged him to be impotent upon
wrong Information, whom Experience and
Truth hath declared to be potent. And
what Man can foretel, how variety of Times
may produce other Judgments. There may
be Que&s;tion of Land or Inheritance, of Le|gitimation
or Illegitimation; and a wi&s;e
<PB N="127" REF="132">
Man would be unwilling to bring it on the
Stage when he is dead and gone, and to
make it the Fable of the World, whether
his Children be born lawfully, or to be re|puted
in the Rank of Ba&s;tards. The World
is &s;ubject to much mutability, and Judges
of future Times may peradventure be led
with the Power of &s;ome great Per&s;ons, and
perhaps may think upon other Con&s;iderati|ons;
that it is but a Conceit, that a Man
&s;hould be potent unto another Woman, and
impotent to his Wife; or that the Common
Law doth not know any <HI>Maleficium,</HI> or that
they do not believe, that there may be <HI>la|tens
impedimentum perpetuum,</HI> and <HI>incurabile
ver&s;us hanc,</HI> when they &s;ee that the Hu&s;|band
is in &s;hew of the World, a lu&s;ty, able
Man, and hath well proved his Potency,
by begetting Three or Five, or Seven, or
Ten Children upon another Woman. The&s;e
are pretty Things, if a Man do well con&s;i|der
them, and will &s;erve to make di&s;tracti|on
between Kin&s;man and Kin&s;man, and
make work for the Lawyers, and keep the
Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> that they &s;hall not be
idle; which if we could not learn other|wi&s;e,
yet <HI>Bury</HI>'s Ca&s;e before remember'd
doth teach us, who was divorced from his
Wife in the 3d or 4th Year of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI>
and when his Brother had enjoyed
his Land until the 40th Year of the &s;aid
Queen, then was he thru&s;t out of it, and
<PB N="128" REF="133">
the que&s;tion'd Son, or his Heir, was put
into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by Trial of Law; a
great deal of Money being &s;pent in that
Contention, and both Civilians and com|mon
Lawyers in great Numbers were en|tertain'd
of both Sides; and yet the Con|trover&s;y
was not &s;o appea&s;ed, but that of
my certain Knowledge, within the&s;e three
Years it had been rai&s;ed again, and a &s;trong
device was laid how to bring this about a|gain;
only my &s;elf with&s;tood it, and would
not give way unto it, when I was divers
Times con&s;ulted thereabout; conceiving
very well, that it would not be long before
&s;ome Prohibition would come out of &s;ome
of the King's Courts, becau&s;e the common
Law di&s;liked, that Mens Inheritance, e&s;pe|cially
after Judgments, &s;hould be di&s;turb|ed,
when the Parties whom mo&s;t of all it
concerned, are dead long before, and can|not
an&s;wer for them&s;elves; whereas, per|adventure,
if them&s;elves had been living,
they could have an&s;wered that for them|&s;elves
which other Men know not. And
there ought to be a &s;ettled Cour&s;e in all
Things appertaining to Inheritance.</P>
<P>By this Time, I hope you &s;ee, that it is
not out of willfulne&s;s, or prejudicate Con|ceit,
that I have impugned this Nullity,
but out of ground of Rea&s;on, and out of
&s;cruple of Con&s;cience, which is it that mu&s;t
accu&s;e me, or excu&s;e me, before the ever|living
<PB N="129" REF="134">
God. I know you have heard what
other Men have &s;aid, and they have an|&s;wered
for them&s;elves. Upon all which
Grounds I make this Conclu&s;ion, That
how&s;oever this Matter of Separation with
great earne&s;tne&s;s hath been per&s;ued, yet
it is the &s;urer and the &s;afer way to leave it
as we find it, and in no Ca&s;e to di&s;&s;olve it.
I oft remember that Saying, which is fre|quent
among the Canoni&s;ts; <HI>Tolerabilius e&s;t
aliquos contra &s;tatuta hominum dimittere copu|latos,
quam conjunctos legitim&egrave; contra &s;tatuta
Domini &s;eparare.</HI> That concerneth us who
be the Judges, and for the Parties them|&s;elves,
who perhaps can be content to be
&s;evered, and to Marry el&s;ewhere, let them
know this from me, that they may be&s;t
expect a Ble&s;&s;ing from God when they live
in that State where fewe&s;t &s;cruples &s;hall a|ri&s;e
in their Mind: From which, whether
they &s;hall be free in leaving their old Con|junction,
and betaking them&s;elves unto a
new, I refer to their wi&s;er Thoughts, when
in all probability, if any cro&s;s or thwart
&s;hall ari&s;e in their new intended Matrimo|ny,
this perplexity and angui&s;h will &s;till
follow their Souls, that they have done
that, whereof in their true&s;t Meditations
they have no ground of Con&s;cience, and
therefore that it is the Hand of God upon
them, who giveth not a Ble&s;&s;ing unto that
which was unduly &s;ought.</P>

You have thus at large heard my Opini|on
again&s;t the annullation of this Marriage.
Now, if you ask me, what would you then
have done concerning this Couple of noble
Per&s;onages: my An&s;wer is, that I would have
a Reconciliation by all means to be labour|ed;
and although that be difficult to bring
about, yet it is the more Honour when it is
effected. Charity will forgive, and forget
the highe&s;t Offences. It is St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s
Judgment, <HI>That in the greate&s;t Breaches be|tween
Man and Wife, Reconciliation is the
be&s;t; and the worthie&s;t Pains that can be be|&s;tow'd,
is to bring that about.</HI> There want|eth
only one or more good Mediators, and
then great Things will be compa&s;&s;ed. The
di&s;agreement was inconceivable between
God and Man, yet Chri&s;t, that great Me|diator,
did take it away. The Breach was
very bitter between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> yet
our mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Soveraign, as a gracious
Interce&s;&s;or, did give an end unto it. Let
Divines be u&s;ed now, as much as Lawyers
have been u&s;ed heretofore. Take the god|ly
Coun&s;el of the one, which will be given
freely, as you have taken the Advice of the
other with much expence of Money. This
I wi&s;h for, this I pray for, and if my Coun|&s;el
had been u&s;ed, before Things grew to
this height, I would have u&s;ed my be&s;t
means to have wrought an Atonement.
But becau&s;e there is no hope thereof, and
<PB N="131" REF="136">
this doth expect a legal Deci&s;ion, proceed
you that plea&s;e unto this Separation. Give

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AFTER I had received, and read
your Papers, which the Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Litchfield</HI> brought me, I found
it very nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould
make an&s;wer thereunto at my fir&s;t lei|&s;ure;
for whereas, before, at my la&s;t meet|ing
with you, ye &s;eemed to me to be only
as yet unre&s;olved what Sentence to give in
this Bu&s;ine&s;s till you had heard it throughly
di&s;puted, that by that means ye might be
fully informed of the State of the Cau&s;e:
it appears now by the&s;e Papers, that you
have, after your la&s;t Days con&s;ultation, put
on a negative Re&s;olution, grounded upon
Fundaments of Divinity and Con&s;cience,
as you think, which hath mov'd me to &s;end
you herewith my Judgment upon your Ar|guments,
in regard that I did ever hold it
nece&s;&s;ary that in a Matter of this Weight
all my Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be as near of
one Mind, as might be, and therefore I
would be &s;orry that your private Conceits
<PB N="133" REF="138">
&s;hould &s;o blind your Judgment, as to make
you and your Followers draw the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perplex or torment.</NOTE> Cathar|rows
again&s;t your Yoke-fellows; for, that I
may now open plainly my Heart unto you,
at my fir&s;t reading of your Papers from the
Bi&s;hop, I chance to ca&s;t mine Eye fir&s;t up|on
the Paper of your Arguments before I
had looked upon your Letter, and lighting
upon your fir&s;t Words, <HI>In as much as we do
firmly believe,</HI> &amp;c. I prote&s;t I thought it had
been &s;ome &s;trange Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, that
you had intercepted among&s;t &s;ome of the
Sectaries; but when I had read out the re&s;t
of that fir&s;t Article, God is my Judge, I
thought that Paper had been &s;ome Pa&s;quil
made again&s;t this Divorce, which coming
to your hands ye had &s;ent me, and therefore
without reading any farther therein, I look|ed
upon your Letter, which re&s;olv'd me of
all the&s;e Doubts; but after that I had fully
peru&s;ed, and rightly con&s;ider'd of all your
Papers, I found your Principles &s;o &s;trange,
and your Doubts &s;o far &s;ought, that I thought
it nece&s;&s;ary, as I have already &s;aid, to &s;et
down unto you my Ob&s;ervations upon them.
But to conclude my Letter with that plain|ne&s;s
that becometh one of my Quality, I
mu&s;t freely confe&s;s, that I find the Grounds
of your Oppo&s;ition &s;o weak, as I have rea|&s;on
to apprehend, that the Prejudice you
<PB N="134" REF="139">
have of the Per&s;ons, is the greate&s;t Motive
of breeding the&s;e Doubts into you; which
Prejudice is the mo&s;t dangerous Thing that
can fall in a Judge for mi&s;leading of his
Mind. And the Rea&s;on moving me to this
Apprehen&s;ion, is partly grounded upon
your la&s;t Words to me at your parting from
<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and partly upon a Line &s;crap'd
out in your Paper of Doubts, for I am &s;ure
you think me not &s;o blunt a Secretary, but
that I can read a Line &s;o &s;craped out. In
your la&s;t Speeches with me, you remember
you told me what A&s;&s;urance you had of the
Earl's Ability out of his own Mouth, which
you &s;aid you could not but tru&s;t, becau&s;e he
was &s;o religious a Nobleman. But when I
told you of the other Party's contrary Af|firmation,
you remember how you u&s;ed the
Word of Iniquity, and how far your inter|lined
Line &s;eems to have a Harmony with
this Word, your &s;elf can be&s;t judge. Now
then, if I would ask you what Proof you
have of the one's Religion more than the o|ther's,
you mu&s;t an&s;wer me, by judging upon
the Exterior; and how deceivable that Gue&s;s
is, daily experience teaches us. But with a ho|ly
Prote&s;tation that I never knew any Thing
but good in the young Earl. Was not this
the Ground of Ma&s;ter <HI>Robert Bru&s;e</HI>'s Incre|dulity,
becau&s;e he knew the Earl of <HI>Gowry</HI>
to be truly Religious; and did not beg a
Regi&s;ter. <HI>Bothwel</HI> in his Preface of his Book
<PB N="135" REF="140">
<HI>De viris Illu&s;tribus.</HI> And as for your Judgment
of the other Party, <HI>Chri&s;t's Precept</HI> is the
be&s;t An&s;wer unto you, <HI>nolite judicare.</HI> But
if the Que&s;tion were to judge of the Earl's
Inclination, whether is it likely that you or
I could be&s;t judge of it; I, he having been
bred with my late Son, and &s;erv'd him &s;o
long, or you that never &s;poke with him but
once or twice in your Life, and never knew
either good or evil of him but out of his
own Mouth. I will conclude therefore,
with inverting the Argument; that if a
Judge &s;hould have a Prejudice in re&s;pect of
Per&s;ons, it &s;hould become you rather, to
have a kind of Faith implicit, in my Judg|ment,
as well in re&s;pect of &s;ome Skill I have
in Divinity; as al&s;o that I hope no hone&s;t
Man doubts of the uprightne&s;s of my Con|&s;cience;
and the be&s;t thankfulne&s;s that you
that are &s;o far my Creature, can u&s;e to|wards
me, is, to reverence, and follow my
Judgment, and not to contradict it, except
where you may demon&s;trate unto me that I
am mi&s;taken, or wrong imformed, and &s;o

Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> were
married by publick Rites
and Ceremonies of the
Church, on the 5th Day
of <HI>January,</HI> 1606.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="137" REF="142">
II. That &s;he at that time was full Thir|teen
Years old, and is at this pre&s;ent, about
Twenty Two, or Twenty Three.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the fore&s;aid <HI>Robert,</HI> at the
time of the pretended Marriage, was a|bout
Fourteen Years old, and is at this pre|&s;ent,
about Twenty Three or Twenty Four,
and at that time, and ever &s;ince, and at
this pre&s;ent, is a Man (as far forth as a
Man can judge) and hath been in good
Health and perfect E&s;tate of Body, not a|ny
way hindred by any <HI>Ague</HI> or Sickne&s;s,
but that he might have carnal Copulation
with a Woman.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That &s;ince the pretended Marriage,
at lea&s;t by the Space of whole and continu|ate
Three Years, after the &s;aid <HI>Robert</HI> had
fully attained to the Age of Eighteen Years,
as Time and Place did &s;erve, after the
fa&s;hion of other married Couples, the &s;aid
<HI>Frances Howard,</HI> in hope of lawful I&s;&s;ue,
and that &s;he might be made a Mother, li|ved
together with the &s;aid <HI>Robert</HI> at Bed
and Board, and lay both naked and alone
in the &s;ame Bed, as married Folks u&s;e;
and de&s;irous to be made a Mother from
time to time, again and again, yielded her
&s;elf wholly to his Power, and as much
as lay in her, offer'd her &s;elf, and her Bo|dy
<PB N="138" REF="143">
to be known, and earne&s;tly &s;ought and
de&s;ired Conjunction and Copulation.</P>
<P N="5">V. And al&s;o the &s;aid Earl in the afore|&s;aid
time, very often, again and again, did
try to have carnal Copulation, as with his
lawful Wife, which &s;he refu&s;ed not, but
u&s;ed the be&s;t Means &s;he could; notwith|&s;tanding
all this, the &s;aid Earl could never
carnally know her, nor have that Copula|tion
in any &s;ort which the married Bed
alloweth.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Yet before the &s;aid pretended Mar|riage,
and &s;ince the &s;aid Earl hath had and
hath Power&punc; and Ability of Body, to deal
with other Women, and to know them car|nally,
and &s;ometimes hath felt the Motion,
and Prick of the Fle&s;h, tending to carnal
Copulation, as he &s;aith and believeth, and
peradventure truly; but by a perpetual,
and natural Impediment, hath been hin|dred
all the former time, and is at this
pre&s;ent, that he can have no Dealing or
Copulation with the fore&s;aid Lady
<HI>Frances.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Furthermore, the &s;aid Lady <HI>Fran|ces</HI>
hath been, and is a Woman fit and a|ble
to have Copulation with a Man, and
&s;uch an one, as may be carnally known,
neither hath in this regard any Impedi|ment.</P>

VIII. Moreover the &s;aid Lady <HI>Frances</HI>
remaineth, and is at this pre&s;ent a Vir|gin.</P>

Marriage, the &s;aid Lady <HI>Frances</HI> was
utterly ignorant and unacquainted with the

formerly mentioned.</P>
<P N="10">X. Al&s;o the fore&s;aid Earl long before
this Suit commenced, hath very often, and

before Witne&s;&s;es of Credit, and his Friends
and Kinsfolk, that although he did greatly
de&s;ire, and did his be&s;t Endeavours, yet
he never could, nor at this pre&s;ent, can
have carnal Copulation with the &s;aid Lady
<HI>Frances,</HI> no not once.</P>
<P N="11">XI. La&s;tly, in regard of Womani&s;h Mo|de&s;ty,
the &s;aid Lady <HI>Frances</HI> hath concealed
all the former Matters, and had a Purpo&s;e

<HEAD>His Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer to the Arch-bi&s;hop's
Rea&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>TO the fir&s;t Article, that the Scrip|ture
directly, or by Con&s;equence
doth contain &s;ufficient Matter to decide all
<PB N="153" REF="158">
Controver&s;ies, e&s;pecially in things appertain|ing
to the Church; this in my Opinion is
<HI>propo&s;itio erronea,</HI> and one of the Puritan's
Grounds, without a better Di&s;tinction or
Explanation. For the Orthodox Propo&s;i|tion
is, That the Scripture doth directly, or
by Con&s;equence, contain in it &s;elf &s;uffici|ent
Matter to decide all Controver&s;ies in
Points of Faith and Salvation; of which
&s;ort a Nullity in Marriage cannot be ac|counted
for one; and therefore your Con|&s;equence
upon the former Propo&s;ition mu&s;t
fail.</P>
<P>For farther Satisfaction to your former
Que&s;tion, I &s;ay, your own Second Que&s;ti|on
doth an&s;wer it: For if there be a War|rant
in Scripture for pronouncing a Nullity,
<HI>propter frigiditatem,</HI> then all the Means,
which may make him <HI>frigidus ver&s;us hanc,</HI>
mu&s;t be comprehended therein. For why
doth our Church ju&s;tly condemn as ince&s;tu|ous,
the Marriage of a Man with his Si|&s;ter's
Daughter, or the Marriage of Two
Si&s;ters, but <HI>&agrave; Paritate Rationis?</HI> for none
of them is in <HI>terminis</HI> prohibited by the
Scripture, only the Conclu&s;ion is gather'd
<HI>&agrave; Paritate Rationis.</HI> For if it be not lawful
to marry your Father's Wife, becau&s;e there|by
you di&s;cover your Father's Shame; nor
his Si&s;ter, becau&s;e &s;he is his Kin&s;woman;
nor your own Si&s;ter, becau&s;e thereby you
di&s;cover your Father, and Mother's Shame:
<PB N="154" REF="159">
It can no more be lawful to marry your
Si&s;ter's Daughter; for thereby you al&s;o
di&s;cover your own Shame. As al&s;o that
the &s;ame Rea&s;on &s;erves for a&s;cending or de|&s;cending,
in Points of Con&s;anguinity, <HI>quia
par e&s;t Ratio.</HI> The like is in this Ca&s;e, for
altho' Chri&s;t &s;pake only of three &s;orts of
Eunuchs, yet <HI>ratio e&s;t quia non potest e&s;&s;e co|pula
inter Eunuchum &amp; mulierem,</HI> and there|fore
St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the 6th of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI>
telleth us clearly, that it is no <HI>Conjunction
&s;ine copula:</HI> I conclude therefore, <HI>&agrave; paritate
rationis,</HI> that Chri&s;t did comprehend under
tho&s;e three &s;orts of Eunuchs all Inability,
which did perpetually hinder <HI>Copulam ver|&s;us
hanc,</HI> whether it were natural or acci|dental.
For what Difference is there be|twixt
cutting off of the Hand, and being
made impotent thereof? <HI>Amputatio &amp;
mutulatio Membri,</HI> is all one in the Civil
Law, and it is alike defrauding of the Wo|man,
when either he who is to be her Hus|band
is gelded, or when the U&s;e of that
Member towards her is by any unlawful
Means taken from him. Neither is it any
way needful to crave the particular War|rant
of Nullity, <HI>propter Maleficium,</HI> out of
the Scripture, no more than there is War|rant
in that Place for any Nullity at all.
For Chri&s;t doth not directly &s;ay, that a
Marriage &s;o made &s;hall be null; neither
doth he teach us what Form of Proce&s;s &s;hall
<PB N="155" REF="160">
be u&s;ed in it; neither maketh he mention
of a triennial Probation, no more than he
forbiddeth Marriage within the Fourth
Degree, without Leave obtained of the
Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;s. It is therefore &s;uf|ficient
to all moderate Chri&s;tians, to be
taught out of the Word, that Marriage is
null <HI>&s;ine Copula,</HI> and that the Word <HI>Quos
Deus conjunxit,</HI> is never found in the Scrip|ture,
where <HI>erunt</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> doth not
precede, (<HI>viz. they &s;hall be one Fle&s;h.</HI>) But
whether the Impediment be univer&s;al, or
<HI>ver&s;us hanc</HI> only, and whether the Fault
thereof have been born with him, or done
to him by Violence, or fallen by Di&s;ea&s;e,
or by Di&s;proportion, or Ineptitude betwixt
the Parties, or by unlawful or unnatural
Practices, it is ever <HI>par ratio:</HI> He is <HI>Eu|nuchus
ver&s;us hanc</HI>; for he ought to be <HI>Eu|nuchus
ver&s;us omnes alias,</HI> &s;eeing to her only
he was married; and therefore <HI>&agrave; Paritate
Rationis,</HI> &s;uch Nullities are grounded upon
the afore&s;aid Warrant of Scripture; nei|ther
had Chri&s;t then any Occa&s;ion to &s;peak
to the <HI>Jews</HI> concerning <HI>Maleficium</HI>; for as
it is apparent, that God made King <HI>Abime|lech</HI>
and his Family unable to abu&s;e <HI>Sarah,</HI>
<HI>Abraham</HI>'s Wife; and &s;o was he made by
God him&s;elf <HI>Eunuchus ver&s;us hanc:</HI> is it not
improbable, that the Devil being God's
Ape, &s;hould imitate God's Work by his
filthy Witchcraft, by making &s;uch as God
<PB N="156" REF="161">
will permit him, <HI>inhabile ver&s;us hanc,</HI> tho'
it may be, that it was long after that time,
before the Devil put that Trick in u&s;e up|on
the Earth.</P>
<P>As to your Third and Fourth Que&s;tions,
What mention the Fathers, and Councils
make of <HI>Maleficium ver&s;us hanc?</HI> Fir&s;t, I
an&s;wer, That it may be, if they be well
&s;earched, that either &s;omething to this
purpo&s;e &s;hall be found in them; or at lea&s;t
<HI>aliquid analogum,</HI> which <HI>&agrave; paritate rationis,</HI>
or by Con&s;equence, may &s;erve to decide
this Que&s;tion. But leaving this to the
Search, my main An&s;wer is, That we mu&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;h of Times. For in all the fir&s;t
Ages, as long as Per&s;ecution lay heavy up|on
the Church, and before that the Empe|rors
became Chri&s;tians, the Church did
not meddle with Que&s;tions of Marriage;
for the Civil Judges determined them,
who would not &s;uffer the Church to med|dle
with any thing which drew a Con&s;e|quence
after it of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and Inheri|tance,
as Marriage doth. Nay, even di|vers
hundred Years, after the Conver&s;ion
of the Emperors, the Judgment and De|ci&s;ions
of all &s;uch Que&s;tions did &s;till remain
in <HI>foro Civili,</HI> till the Popedom began to
wax great, and a&s;&s;ume, or rather u&s;urp to
her &s;elf a Power of Supreme, or Indepen|dent
Judicatory in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es:
And therefore the Fathers, and Councils
<PB N="157" REF="162">
had no Occa&s;ion to make mention of that
which was not <HI>eorum fori</HI> at that time. And
be&s;ides that, it is an evil Argument to &s;ay,
that &s;uch a thing is unlawful, becau&s;e the
Fathers, and fir&s;t Councils make no men|tion
of it. For you know much beter than I,
that divers main Points in Controver&s;y be|twixt
the Papi&s;ts and us, are never men|tion'd
by the Fathers, becau&s;e they could
never have dreamt that &s;uch Que&s;tions
would ari&s;e; and therefore we only find
the Fathers exact in &s;uch Que&s;tions, as
were mo&s;t agitated, and upon the Stage in
their time; as <HI>de Trinitate: de duabus in
Christo Naturis,</HI> and &s;uch like. It is
therefore &s;ufficient, that there can be no|thing
found in them, which may be ju&s;tly
under&s;tood to contradict this Opinion; and
it is very probable (as I &s;aid before) that
this Trick of <HI>Maleficium</HI> had not then been
put in Practice in the World, and there|fore
not known, nor mentioned by them;
for why may not the Devil find out as well
new Tricks of Witchcraft, when God
will permit him, as he doth daily new &s;orts
of Here&s;ies? for his Malice can never end,
till the End of Times.</P>
<P>To your Fifth Argument my former
An&s;wer doth al&s;o &s;erve. For till the Nine
Hundredth Year of God, it may be, that
that devili&s;h Trick came never to be di&s;|covered,
and you know the old Proverb,
<PB N="158" REF="163">
<HI>Ex malis moribus bonae leges,</HI> and it is not un|likely
that that Time of Darkne&s;s gave the
Devil occa&s;ion of devi&s;ing of &s;uch new
Tricks. Look my <HI>Demonology,</HI> and yet
was that Law, for which you cite <HI>Hincma|rus
Epi&s;copus Rhemen&s;is,</HI> made by <HI>Charles the
Great,</HI> who in many great Points, as you
know, had &s;o great Light, as I dare &s;carcely
term his Time a Time of Blindne&s;s. But
how great and palpable &s;oever that Dark|ne&s;s
was in Points of Super&s;tition, I will
&s;till maintain it, as I have ever done, that
for Matter of Order and Policy, all the
World &s;hall never be able to find out any
other &s;o good, and &s;o old an Order of Go|vernment
to be put in the place of it. In
&s;ign whereof, there is no well governed
Commonwealth in the Chri&s;tian World,
where the Canon Law is not received to
judge in Que&s;tions of that Nature; and it
is certain, that this Que&s;tion in hand is on|ly
a Que&s;tion of Order and Policy; for the
Grounds of this Que&s;tion, <HI>That the e&s;&s;ential
Point of Matrimony cannot be accompli&s;hed, &s;i|ne
Copula,</HI> is warranted by expre&s;s Scrip|ture,
and confe&s;&s;ed by your &s;elf.</P>
<P>To your Sixth Argument, or rather
Hope, I fear that Hope &s;hall prove contra|ry
to Faith. For as &s;ure as God is, there
be Devils, and Devils mu&s;t have &s;ome
Power, and their Power is in this World,
(for <HI>Satan</HI> is the Prince of this World:)
<PB N="159" REF="164">
Neither are the Elect exempted from his
Power; <HI>Job</HI> was not; St. <HI>Paul</HI> was not:
Chri&s;t &s;aith to all his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Cribravit
vos Satanas.</HI> And if the Devil hath any
Power over the Elect, it is over their Fle&s;h;
and if over the Fle&s;h, rather over the
fle&s;he&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;inful part thereof; where|unto
original Sin is &s;o tyed, as God, both be|fore
and under the Law, to &s;hew the diffi|culty
of purging Mans original Sin, ordain|ed
the amputation of the Fore-skin of that
Member. And to exempt tho&s;e of our
Profe&s;&s;ion from the Power of Witchcraft,
is a Paradox never yet maintained by any
Learned, or Wi&s;e Man. That the Devils
Power is not &s;o univer&s;ally unbridled a|mong&s;t
us, that I freely confe&s;s, but that it
is totally re&s;trained, <HI>quoad nos,</HI> how then
was a Mini&s;ter of <HI>Geneva</HI> bewitched to
Death? And how are the Witches daily
puni&s;hed by our Laws? Surely if they can
harm none but the Papi&s;ts, we are too Cha|ritable
to labour for avenging them only.
<HI>Satan</HI> is permitted to puni&s;h Man as well for
the breach of the Second, as the Fir&s;t Ta|ble;
and thereof are we no le&s;s Guilty
than the Papi&s;ts are. And if the Power of
Witchcraft may reach to our Life, how
much more to a Member? e&s;pecially to a
Member &s;o governed by the Fanta&s;ie,
wherein the Devil hath his principal Opera|tion,
and he may &s;o e&s;trange the Husband's
<PB N="160" REF="165">
Affection from the Wife, as he cannot be
able to perform that Duty unto her. For
it is a common Thing in many Mens Na|ture,
that they cannot do that Act but
where they Love, nor Fight but when they
are Angry. God keep us therefore from
putting the Trial of our Profe&s;&s;ion upon
Miracles; let the Miracle-mongers live by
their own Trade.</P>
<P>To your Seventh Argument touching the
Remedies, what do you know whether both
Parties, or either of them, have u&s;ed both
tho&s;e Remedies or not? And that that &s;pi|ritual
Remedy of Fa&s;ting and Prayer &s;hould
be u&s;ed publickly for them, I can &s;ee no
nece&s;&s;ity. For <HI>non intere&s;t Reipublicae nec Ec|cle&s;iae.</HI>
And private Per&s;ons are command|ed
to u&s;e their Fa&s;ting and Alms &s;ecretly,
and in private; be&s;ides, that no &s;uch Re|medy
or Cure is likely to &s;ucceed well, ex|cept
the Parties own Heart and De&s;ire be
&s;et upon it.</P>
<P>And as for your Conclu&s;ion upon the <HI>in|commodum,</HI>
either in the&s;e Per&s;ons, or in
the Example, I can &s;ee none in either; for
as to this Couple, (betwixt whom Mar|riage
was never truly accompli&s;hed,) they
will peradventure both of them by the de|claratory
of this Nullity, be made capable
to accompli&s;h lawful Marriage with others,
(which they could not do betwixt them|&s;elves)
wherein they may live to the &s;atis|faction
<PB N="161" REF="166">
of their Hearts, and enjoy the Ble&s;|&s;ing
of Procreation of Children. And as
to the Example, the Law &s;hall be fulfilled
by due Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, which
cannot &s;erve for an Example or Pre&s;ident
of counterfeited Nullites in Time to come;
for, <HI>Notoritas facti,</HI> or rather <HI>non facti,</HI> is
<HI>luce clariorie</HI> in this Ca&s;e. Be&s;ides the ma|ny
legal Probations and Confe&s;&s;ions of the
Parties, which have been taken in this Pro|ce&s;s;
whereas by the contrary, if they &s;hall
be forcibly kept together, their Names,
or &s;hadows may well be kept together, but
never their Per&s;ons or Affections; and they
&s;hall be forced to live either in perpetual
Mi&s;ery and Scandal, or both: And what
&s;uch a forced Continency can avail, the
Monks Continency can teach us. And for
a Pre&s;ident in time to come, it can reach no
further than to open a way of lawful Re|lief
for any Parties who &s;hall chance to be
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in that &s;ort. <HI>Hac e&s;t mea &s;enten|tia.</HI></P>
<P>2. And, as for the Extract of our late
Divines Opinions upon this Que&s;tion, I
confe&s;s, I cannot gue&s;s what your intent
was in &s;ending them unto me, for they all
agree in <HI>Terminis</HI> with my Opinion, that
there is &s;uch a Thing as <HI>Maleficiati ver&s;us
hanc</HI>; and your very interlined Pa&s;&s;ages
prove it clearlie&s;t. As for their Advice
concerning the Remedies, that is, <HI>Con&s;ili|um,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="167">
<HI>non jus, nec Decretum</HI>; not impo&s;ing a
nece&s;&s;ity; but is to be u&s;ed by di&s;cretion,
as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erve, or require it.</P>
<P>1. As for the legal Doubts of formality,
they concern none of your Calling. If
your Con&s;cience be re&s;olved in the Points
of Divinity, it is your part to give your
con&s;ent to the Nullity, and let the Lawyers
take the burthen of making it formal.</P>
<P>And as for the triennial Probation, I hope
no Man can be &s;o blind as to make a double
triennial, both <HI>Ante &amp; po&s;t litem conte&s;ta|tam.</HI>
And in Conclu&s;ion, our new Divines
Solution of this Que&s;tion proveth clearly,
that their Re&s;olution upon this Doubt,
(how&s;oever it was fir&s;t conceiv'd in blind|ne&s;s,
as you think,) yet is it now approved
in the time of the greate&s;t Light, and Pu|rity
of the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To conclude then, if this may &s;atisfy
your Doubts, I will end with our Saviour's
Words to St. <HI>Peter, Et cum conver&s;us eris,
confirma fratres tuos.</HI> But I mu&s;t add, <HI>vel
(&s;i opus fuerit) converte fratres tuos.</HI> For on
my Con&s;cience, all the Doubts I have yet
&s;een made in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, are nothing but
<HI>Nodos in Scirpo quaerere.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>The Midwives appointed to make In&s;pe|ction
upon the Lady's Body, gave in, that
the Lady <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> is a Woman apt to have Co|pulation,
and to bring forth Children, and
<PB N="163" REF="168">
that the &s;aid Lady is a Virgin and uncorrup|ted.</P>
<P>Three Ladies affirm, That they believe
the &s;ame, for that they were pre&s;ent when
the Midwives made the In&s;pection, and did
&s;ee them give good Rea&s;ons for it.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline"><P>The Trea&s;urer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of King <HI>James I.</HI> pag. 686. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE> CECIL, Earl of <HI>Sa|lisbury,</HI>
that great Engine of the State,
by whom all Wheels moved, held an in|timate
Corre&s;pondence with the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Suffolk,</HI> which he had &s;trengthned with an
Alliance; marrying his elde&s;t Son, the
Lord <HI>Cranborn,</HI> to <HI>Katharine,</HI> the elde&s;t
Daughter of that Family. And being
mindful of the A&s;perity and Sharpne&s;s
that was betwixt him and the late Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> he thought it a good Act of Policy
and Piety not to &s;uffer Malice to become
Hereditary, and therefore he was a great
Means in marrying the young Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to the Lady <HI>Frances Howard,</HI> ano|ther
of tho&s;e Si&s;ters, that the Father's
Enmity might be clo&s;ed up by the Son's
<PB N="168" REF="173">
Nuptial Fraternity. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
was Fourteen Years of Age, and &s;he
Thirteen, when they married; too young
to con&s;ider, but old enough to con&s;ent:
Yet by the Advice of Friends &s;eparated
after Marriage, &s;he under her Mother's
Wing, and he vi&s;iting <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germa|ny,</HI>
till Time &s;hould mature and ripen a
happy Co-union. The Court was her
Ne&s;t, her Father being Lord Chamber|lain;
and &s;he was hatch'd up by her Mo|ther,
whom the &s;owr Breath of that Age
(how ju&s;tly I know not) had already taint|ed;
from whom the young Lady might
take &s;uch a Tincture, that Ea&s;e, Great|ne&s;s,
and Court Glories, would more di|&s;tain
and impre&s;s on her, than any way
wear out and dimini&s;h. And growing to
be a Beauty of the greate&s;t Magnitude in
that Horizon, was an Object fit for Ad|mirers,
and every Tongue grew an Ora|tor
at that Shrine.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> now in his Puber|ty,
&s;ent many loving Glances, as Amba&s;|&s;adors
of his good Re&s;pects; and amo|rous
Expre&s;&s;ions are fit Subjects for jealous
Reproaches to work on. Her Husband
having been now Three or Four Years
beyond the Seas, (&s;ick with Ab&s;ence from
her whom his De&s;ires longed after) came
over again, and found that Beauty, which
he had left Innocent, &s;o faded and &s;o|phi&s;ticated,
<PB N="169" REF="174">
with &s;ome Court Drug which
had wrought upon her, that he became
the greate&s;t Stranger at home. His Pa|tience
made way for him a while, and
he bore up with a gentle Gale again&s;t the
Stream of this Woman's Affections, which
ran altogether (unknown to him) into a|nother
Channel. Nor was her Reputa|tion
yet become &s;o robu&s;t, (being of a ten|der
Growth) to &s;trike his Ears with Re|proaches;
and therefore he imputed her
&s;ly Entertainments to a Maiden ba&s;hful|ne&s;s;
till &s;urfeited with that dull Potion
(upon better Advice) he went to the
Earl of <HI>Suffolk</HI> (her Father) and demand|ed
his Wife, thinking him&s;elf capable to
enjoy both her and her Love. The Fa|ther,
that thought there had been an In|timacy
betwixt them &s;uitable to their
Conjugal Knot, made u&s;e of his Paternal
Power to reduce his Daughter to the Obe|dience
of a Wife. But while the&s;e
Things were &s;truggling for, a mo&s;t violent
Di&s;ea&s;e of a poy&s;onous Nature, imputed
to, but far tran&s;cending, the Small-Pox,
&s;eized on the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; and had not
the Strength of Youth, and that Almigh|ty
Power that orders all things, wrought
out the Venom of it, the Earth (as
probable wi&s;h'd by her) had been his
Marriage-Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175">
For this Lady being taken with the
growing Fortunes of ROBERT CAR, Vi&s;|count
<HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and grounding more
Hope upon him than the uncertain and
hopele&s;s Love of the Prince, &s;he ca&s;t her
Anchor there, which the Prince &s;oon di&s;|cover'd,
and &s;lighted her accordingly.
For dancing one time among the Ladies,
and her Glove falling down, it was taken
up, and pre&s;ented to him, by one that
thought he did him acceptable Service;
but the Prince refus'd to receive it, &s;ay|ing
publickly, He would not have it, it
is &s;tretcht by another, meaning the Vi&s;|count:
This was an Aggravation of Ha|tred
betwixt the King's Son and the
King's Friend.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> having her Heart
alienated from her Husband, and &s;et up|on
the Vi&s;count, had a double Task to
undergo, for accompli&s;hing her Ends:
One was, to hinder her Husband from
enjoying her; the other was to make the
Vi&s;count &s;ure unto her: For di&s;hone&s;t
Love is mo&s;t full of Jealou&s;y. Her Hus|band
&s;he look'd upon as a private Per&s;on,
and to be carried by him into the Coun|try,
out of her Element, (being Ambi|tious
of Glory, and a Beauty covetous of
Applau&s;e) were to clo&s;e (as &s;he thought)
with an in&s;ufferable Torment; though he
was a Man that did not only every way
<PB N="171" REF="176">
merit her Love, but he lov'd her with an
extraordinary Affection, having a gentle,
mild, and courteous Di&s;po&s;ition, e&s;peci|ally
to Women, &s;uch as might win upon
the roughe&s;t Natures. But this fiery
Heat of his Wife's mounted upon the
Wings of Lu&s;t, or Love, (call it what
you will) carried her after &s;o much Mi&s;|chief,
that tho&s;e that &s;aw her Face,
might challenge Nature of too much Hy|pocri&s;y,
for harbouring &s;o wicked a Heart
under &s;o &s;weet and bewitching a Counte|nance.</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen her De&s;igns, &s;he finds
out one of her own Stamp, Mrs. <HI>Turner,</HI>
a Doctor of Phy&s;ick's Widow, a Woman
whom Prodigality and Loo&s;ne&s;s had
brought low; yet her Pride would make
her fly any Pitch, rather than fall into
the Jaws of Want. The&s;e two con&s;ult
together, how they may &s;top the Current
of the Earl's Affection towards his Wife,
and make a clear Pa&s;&s;age for the Vi&s;count
in the Place. To effect which, one Doctor
<HI>Forman,</HI> a reputed Conjurer, (living at
<HI>Lambeth</HI>) is found out: The Women de|clare
to him their Grievances; he promi|&s;es
&s;udden Help; and to amu&s;e them,
frames many little Pictures of Bra&s;s and
Wax, &s;ome like the Vi&s;count and Counte&s;s,
whom he mu&s;t unite and &s;trengthen; o|thers
like the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> whom he
<PB N="172" REF="177">
mu&s;t debilitate and weaken; and then
with Philtrous Powders, and &s;uch Drugs
he works upon their Per&s;ons. And to
practi&s;e what Effects his Art would pro|duce,
Mrs. <HI>Turner,</HI> that lov'd Sir <HI>Arthur
Manwaring</HI> (a Gentleman then attending
the Prince) and willing to keep him to
her, gave him &s;ome of the Powder, which
wrought &s;o violently with him, that,
through a Storm of Rain and Thunder,
he rode Fifteen Miles one dark Night to
her Hou&s;e, &s;carce knowing where he
was till he was there. <HI>Such is the Devil|i&s;h
and mad Rage of Lu&s;t, heighten'd with
Art and Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things matur'd and ripen'd by
the Cunning of this Jugler <HI>Forman,</HI> gave
them A&s;&s;urance of happy Hopes. Her
Courtly Invitements, that drew the Vi&s;|count
to ob&s;erve her, &s;he imputed to the
Operation of tho&s;e Drugs he had ta&s;ted;
and that Har&s;hne&s;s, and &s;tubborn Com|portment
&s;he expre&s;&s;ed to her Husband,
making him (weary of &s;uch Entertain|ments)
to ab&s;ent him&s;elf, &s;he thought
proceeded from the Effects of tho&s;e un|known
Potions and Powders that were ad|mini&s;tred
to him: So apt is the Imagina|tion
to take Impre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Things
we are willing to believe.</P>
<P>The good Earl finding his Wife nou&s;&s;ed
in the Court, and &s;eeing no Po&s;&s;ibility to
<PB N="173" REF="178">
reduce her to Rea&s;on, till &s;he were e&s;tran|ged
from the Reli&s;h and Ta&s;te of the
Delights &s;he &s;uck'd in there, made his
Condition again known to her Father.
The old Man being troubled with his
Daughter's Di&s;obedience, imbitter'd her,
being near him, with weari&s;ome and con|tinual
Chidings, to wean her from the
Sweets &s;he doted on, and with much a|do,
forc'd her into the Country. But
how har&s;h was the parting, being rent a|way
from the Place where &s;he grew and
flouri&s;h'd? Yet &s;he left all her Engines
and Imps behind her; the old Doctor,
and his Confederate, Mrs. <HI>Turner,</HI> mu&s;t
be her two Supporters: She blazons all
her Mi&s;eries to them at her departure, and
moi&s;tens the Way with her Tears. <HI>Chart|ley</HI>
was an hundred Miles from her Hap|pine&s;s,
and a little time thus lo&s;t is her
Eternity. When &s;he came thither (tho'
in the plea&s;ante&s;t time of Summer) &s;he
&s;hut her &s;elf up in her Chamber, not &s;uf|fering
a Beam of Light to peep upon her
dark Thoughts: If &s;he &s;tir'd out of her
Chamber, it was in the Dead of Night,
when Sleep had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all
others but tho&s;e about her. In this im|placable,
&s;ad, di&s;contented Humour, &s;he
continued &s;ome Months, always mur|muring
again&s;t, but never giving the lea&s;t
civil Re&s;pect to her Husband; which the
<PB N="174" REF="179">
good Man &s;uffer'd patiently, being loath
to be the Divulger of his own Mi&s;ery:
Yet having a Manly Courage, he would
&s;ometimes break into a little Pa&s;&s;ion, to
&s;ee him&s;elf &s;lighted and neglected by him|&s;elf;
but having never found better from
her, it was the ea&s;ier to bear with her.</P>
<P>While &s;he was at <HI>Chartley,</HI> &s;he writ to
her Confederates, That <HI>her Husband found
little Operation in their Drugs, complaining
of his Lu&s;tine&s;s and her Mi&s;ery: For</HI> (&s;he
&s;aid) <HI>the Vi&s;count would never love her, if
her Husband did meddle with her, which
with Difficulty &s;he yet impeded, but how long
&s;he &s;hould re&s;i&s;t his Violence, &s;he knew not;
therefore &s;he implor'd their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if they
would not &s;ee her the mo&s;t de&s;picable Crea|ture
in the World: And for Satisfaction, they
&s;hould make their own Price.</HI> With this
kind of Stuff &s;he fill'd her Letters, which
were after found in <HI>Forman</HI>'s Clo&s;et. The&s;e
In&s;tigations made him active; and the
Man being skilful in Natural Ma|gick,
did u&s;e all the Artifice his Sub|tilty
could devi&s;e, really to imbecili|tate
the Earl; for no Linnen came near
his Body, that was not rin&s;ed with their
Camphire Compo&s;itions, and other faint
and wa&s;ting Ingredients; and all inward
Applications were foi&s;ted on him by cor|rupted
Servants, to le&s;&s;en and debilitate
the Seminal Operations: which <HI>Venefici|um</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="180">
is one great part of Witchcraft, de|&s;tructive
to Nature, and horribly abomi|nable
to be practi&s;ed. And this in time
wrought &s;uch Effects upon his Per&s;on,
that he found him&s;elf unable with her,
tho' &s;he permitted him; yet when he had
been from her &s;ome rea&s;onable time, to
renovate his Spirits, by &s;haking off tho&s;e
Artificial Applications, then his Abilities
made her unwilling and refractory. Tho'
&s;ome are of Opinion, that he was not
much debilitated, but that &s;he got (by
her virtuous Agents) an Artifice too im|mode&s;t
to be expre&s;s'd, to hinder Pene|tration.
And thus &s;he tormented him,
till he was contented to let her &s;teer her
own Cour&s;e, which after run her on
Ground.</P>
<P>For coming to <HI>London</HI> next Winter
with this full Sail, loaden with Lu&s;t, &s;he
found the Vi&s;count much prepar'd for
her; who being at fir&s;t fa&s;ten'd on the
Object, Ab&s;ence, and all tho&s;e little Ar|tifices
that mi&s;chievous Women and cun|ning
Impo&s;tures could devi&s;e, had advan|ced
him as much in his De&s;ires, as they
had hindred the other. We could
di&s;pute the Nature of the&s;e Operations,
how far they are contingent, and how
the Fancy works with them, tho' igno|rant
of them, making their Impul&s;ions
more active, being the Sparks that kin|dle
<PB N="176" REF="181">
this combu&s;tible Matter; for we will
never allow there was any other Diabo|lical
Means u&s;ed, Nature being &s;trong e|enough
for &s;uch a Production; but being
not pertinent to the Story, will leave it,
and follow them that found the Effects of
it, and had Affections &s;uitable to it, which
they made u&s;e of with an unbridled Ap|petite,
yet meeting clo&s;ely in Corners,
(Sin being at fir&s;t &s;hame-fac'd) but after|wards
they grew more bold; and every
Hour that the Vi&s;count could &s;teal from
his Royal Ma&s;ter, he dedicated it to his
di&s;loyal Mi&s;tre&s;s: Being caught in this
Net of Adulation, he becomes a willing
Pri&s;oner; Lu&s;t only getting Liberty to
all Loo&s;ene&s;s and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s: Places
of frequent Meetings are daily renew'd;
Per&s;ons fitted for &s;uch Practices are em|ploy'd;
and when Nature was exhau&s;t|ed,
Art, her &s;ubtle Imitator, brought in
her Store, to contribute new Spirits,
purcha&s;ed at any rate. All outward A|dornment,
to pre&s;ent Beauty in her full
Glory, were not wanting on both &s;ides,
being Lu&s;t's Fuel, which tended to the
Con&s;umption of all Rea&s;on: And among
the re&s;t, yellow Starch, the Invention

<HI>Turner</HI> being nominated to be the fir&s;t

<P>However, the King's Affections were

Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> a Prince as eminent in No|blene&s;s

too full of Life and Splendor, to be
long &s;hrouded in a Cloud of Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Anno.</HI> 1613. The Vi&s;count <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI>
all this while (tho' plung'd in Lu&s;t) was
held up by the Chin in the Glories of the
Court; and the Prince (that interpo&s;ed
betwixt him and the Beams of Ma|je&s;ty)
<PB N="178" REF="183">
being remov'd, the Earl of <HI>Salis|bury</HI>
(another Ob&s;tacle) dying Six Months
after the Prince, in the Way from the
<HI>Bath</HI>; he now took full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
King's Favours alone. He executes the
Place of Principal Secretary, receiving
all Pacquets, and di&s;patching An&s;wers
without the Knowledge of the King or
Council; or if the King did know, his
Love had hoarded up &s;uch a Confidence
in him, as he laid all out upon that Stock.
<HI>Rochester</HI>'s greate&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tant was a pri|vate
Gentleman, one Sir <HI>Thomas Over|bury,</HI>
by who&s;e Compa&s;s he &s;teer'd his
Cour&s;e, who (being a Man of Parts and
Abilities) had wrought upon the Vi&s;|count
&s;o, as not only to keep him in, and
clo&s;e with the King, but to make him ca|pable
of managing the highe&s;t Affairs, if
he had kept him&s;elf within the Circle
drawn to his Hand. This Intimacy be|twixt
them, &s;pake <HI>Overbury,</HI> an Actor in
all his Privacies. And when he under|&s;tood
by the Vi&s;count his Intention of
Marriage with the Counte&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> he
oppos'd it with all the powerful Argu|ments
he could u&s;e: For tho' he might
be &s;o active, in his Initiation of Favour
with the Vi&s;count, to be A&s;&s;i&s;tant to his
Plea&s;ures, and for carrying forward &s;ome
of his dark Contrivances, (tho&s;e Secre|taries
being always the greate&s;t Favou|rites)
<PB N="179" REF="184">
yet having now gotten good foot|ing
in his Affection, and building his For|tune
thereon, his Rea&s;on might tell him,
there could be nothing more de&s;tructive
to both their growing Hopes, than to lay
a Foundation upon &s;o much publick In|ju&s;tice,
as to marry another Man's Wife,
her Husband living; therefore he pa&s;|&s;ionately
per&s;waded him to ca&s;t his
Thoughts upon a more honourable Ob|ject,
and not one, who&s;e Di&s;loyalty (in
her pre&s;ent Condition) was &s;o much
branded with Infamy, that the Marks of
it would be vi&s;ible on his Face. But the
Vi&s;count, bewitched with the Entice|ments
of his Soul-ravi&s;hing Mi&s;tre&s;s, (un|capable
of good Coun&s;el) doth not only
call home his Affections from <HI>Overbury,</HI>
that had been long Leiger with him,
(denouncing Enmity) but incites his Be|loved
again&s;t him al&s;o; who mu&s;tering
up all her Pa&s;&s;ions, with the greate&s;t A|crimony,
that a Feminine Malice could
devi&s;e, &s;he never left, till &s;he had di&s;|charg'd
all the Vollies of her Rage upon
him. And the better to do it, &s;he con|&s;ults
with her Uncle, the Earl of <HI>North|ampton,</HI>
aggravating <HI>Overbury</HI>'s Offence,
as tending to the Di&s;honour of their
whole Family: That he (a petty Fellow)
&s;hould dare to rai&s;e &s;uch Scandals again&s;t
her Innocency. The Earl of <HI>North|ampton,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="185">
that knew of the Endearments
betwixt the Vi&s;count and his Niece, (&s;o
ba&s;e and mercenary was his Spirit)
thought it good Policy to &s;top all Pa&s;&s;a|ges,
that it might not come into the pub|lick
Mouth: For being in a Sphere elated
above others, it was a Sin of a high Pre|&s;umption,
for any of an inferior Orb to
move but in its own Place, or meddle with
what is above them. He therefore clo&s;es
with the Vi&s;count, (whom in his flattering
Acclamations by Letters, he makes a lit|tle
Deity) and after &s;ome Di&s;pute of the
manner how to be revenged of <HI>Overbury,</HI>
they conclude to di&s;patch him by Poi&s;on,
which could not be done &s;o well in a pub|lick
way; and therefore they &s;ubtilly
contrive to exa&s;perate the King a|gain&s;t
him, that being a Pri&s;oner, and
&s;hackled by them to a Place, he might
be a more &s;ettled Mark for their enve|nom'd
Arrows.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, the King think|ing
fit to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
to the Arch-Duke (&s;ome &s;ay, into
<HI>France</HI>) the Vi&s;count recommended Sir
<HI>Thomas Overbury</HI> to the King for that
Service, (extolling his Abilities, and Fit|ne&s;s
for the &s;ame, publickly, that more
Notice might be taken of the Affront) and
the King made choice of him for that
Employment, Which done, the Vi&s;|count
<PB N="181" REF="186">
(under the Shadow of Friend&s;hip)
imparts to <HI>Overbury,</HI> what Intentions the
King had towards him; but he thought
it would not be &s;o convenient for him to
accept of it, becau&s;e he &s;hould not only
lo&s;e his Conver&s;e and Company by &s;uch
an Alienation, (which he highly valued)
but many a fair Opportunity of impro|ving
his Re&s;pects to him, in &s;ome better
way of Advancement. <HI>Overbury</HI> had
not been &s;o little a Courtier, or a Man of
&s;o mean Rea&s;on, but that he was &s;en&s;ible
what Di&s;plea&s;ure he &s;hould pull upon
him&s;elf, by refu&s;ing the King's Com|mands:
And therefore he told the Vi&s;|count,
that betwixt the King's Favours,
and his Friend&s;hip, he had a great Con|flict
in his Spirit, being willing to retain
both; but how he &s;hould refu&s;e the
King's Commands with Safety, he knew
not. But the Vi&s;count, with fair Pro|mi&s;es,
prevail'd with him to &s;et up his
Re&s;t at home, upon higher Expectation,
(&s;uch a &s;weet Bait is Ambition!) pro|te&s;ting
to take off the A&s;perity of the
King's Anger from him, and &s;mooth his
Way &s;o, as &s;hould be for his better Ad|vantage.
When he had wrought <HI>Over|bury</HI>
in this Forge, he goes to the King,
and blows the Fire, incen&s;ing him with
all the Aggravations he could; &s;o that
the poor Gentleman, for his Contempt
<PB N="182" REF="187">
was forthwith committed to the <HI>Tower.</HI>
And to prepare all things for his Recep|tion
there, Sir <HI>William Wade,</HI> the late
Lieutenant, was remov'd, and Sir <HI>Jervis
Ellowis,</HI> a Per&s;on more ambitious than in|digent
(having made his Way by Mony,
the common Merit) was admitted to the
Place.</P>
<P>Now the Counte&s;s, like another <HI>A|lecto,</HI>
drove furiou&s;ly, her Chariot ha|ving
two Wheels, which ran over all Im|pediments:
One was, to &s;ue a Divorce
betwixt her and her Husband, that &s;he
might marry the Vi&s;count: The other
was, to take away <HI>Overbury,</HI> the Blemi&s;h
in her Eye, and that laid &s;uch a Stain
upon her, that nothing but his Blood
could expiate. For the&s;e &s;he hath &s;eve|ral
Engines; the one mu&s;t be acted O|vertly;
the other Covertly, in dark
Corners; and &s;he and her Agents find
fit Mini&s;ters for both.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> re&s;enting his
Nieces Grievances, makes the King ac|quainted
with her Maiden Ba&s;hfulne&s;s,
how loth &s;he is to divulge her Husband's
Infirmities, and how long it is &s;ince her
Marriage, and yet &s;he hath not enjoyed
the Happine&s;s of a Wife; that her Hus|band's
Inability mu&s;t needs be an unna|tural
Conjunction, &s;uch as neither Law
nor Rea&s;on can admit of; and that there
<PB N="183" REF="188">
was a great Affection betwixt the Vi&s;count
and her, &s;o as there &s;eem'd to be a more
excellent Sympathy, and &s;weet Compo|&s;ition
of Soul in them, more &s;uitable to
Rea&s;on and Nature, than in the State
&s;he was in Which was &s;econded by the
Vi&s;count's humble Submi&s;&s;ions to the
King's great Wi&s;dom, who (he acknow|ledg'd)
had not only rai&s;ed him to what
he is, but may yet make him more hap|py,
by uniting him to a Lady of &s;o much
Honour and Virtue.</P>
<P>The King, that took Delight to com|pleat
the Happine&s;s of them he lov'd,
commanded the Bi&s;hops to &s;ue out a Di|vorce
between the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and
his Lady, that the Vi&s;count might
marry her: For he had been practis'd
formerly in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in his Minority,
with the like Experiment. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> being
married to the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> under
pretence of Impotency, but merely for
Lu&s;t, (as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s Hi&s;t. of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> Author reports) was Di|vorced
from her Husband, and married
to the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> (the King's Favou|rite)
who had been before a Partner in
her Adulterous Sheets, (&s;o current is the
Parrallel, and &s;o equally are Lu&s;t and
Ambition yoked together, that they both
<PB N="184" REF="189">
(with full Violence) draw one and the
&s;ame Way.)</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops and others, having a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI>
to convene the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and his
Counte&s;s before them, &s;ent out their
Summons, and they made their Appea|rance
accordingly. But before they pro|ceeded,
they cau&s;ed a Jury of Twelve
di&s;creet Matrons to be impanell'd, to
&s;earch the Counte&s;s, whether &s;he were
(as &s;he pretended to be, and was repu|ted)
a Maid &s;till; for if &s;he were a Maid,
they could fa&s;ten upon a Nullity, and &s;o
&s;eparate them for the more Honour of
her Virginity. The Counte&s;s being a|&s;ham'd,
and ba&s;hful, to come to &s;uch a
Trial, would not expo&s;e her Face to the
Light; but being to appear before the
Matrons under a Veil, another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said to be one of Sir <HI>Thomas Mon&s;on</HI>'s Daugh|ters, for the Counte&s;s was reported to have had a Child in the Earl's Ab&s;ence.</NOTE> young
Gentlewoman, that had le&s;s offended,
was fobbed into the Place; and &s;he pa&s;|&s;ed,
in the Opinion, both of Jury and
Judges, to be a Virgin.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bi&s;hops, and the re&s;t of the
Judges, could not be ignorant what &s;can|dalous
Reports of this Lady's Actions
flew up and down, from Lip to Lip;
<PB N="185" REF="190">
which, however &s;weeten'd by the Parta|kers,
carried an ill Savour with them in
every hone&s;t Under&s;tanding, who were
not blinded with Wilfulne&s;s, or deafned
with Prejudice, which made the Bi&s;hops of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> decline the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
though nominated in the Patent.
But Kings will never want fit Mini&s;ters in
corrupted Times, both in Church and
Commonwealth, as long as there are de|grees,
and Places of A&s;cent to clime to.
And though the&s;e Things floated a while
upon the Streams of Greatne&s;s, yet there
is one above that moves the Waters;
who did not only &s;ee what pa&s;s'd in the
Bi&s;hop's Palace, but in the clo&s;e&s;t Pri&s;on,

very well as ever he was, &s;o as you may &s;ee in

pray for me, for I have need, but I &s;hould
be better if I had your Company to ea&s;e my Mind,
let him know this all News; if I can get this
done, you &s;hall have as much Money as you can
demand; this is <HI>fair play.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sweet Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t &s;till crave your Love, although I hope I
have it, and &s;hall de&s;erve it better hereaf|ter,
<PB N="193" REF="198">
remember the Galls, for I fear tho' I have
yet no cau&s;e, but to be confident in you, yet I
de&s;ire to have it as it is yet remaining well, &s;o
continue it &s;till, if it be po&s;&s;ible; and if you can
you mu&s;t &s;end me &s;ome good Fortune; alas! I
have need of it; keep the Lord &s;till to me, for
that I de&s;ire: and be careful you name me not
to any body, for we have &s;o many Spies, that you
mu&s;t u&s;e all your Wits, and all little enough, for
the World is again&s;t me, and the Heavens fa|vour
me not. Only happy in your Love; I hope
you will do me good, and if I be ungrateful, let all
mi&s;chief come unto me. My Lord is lu&s;ty and
merry, and drinketh with his Men; and all the
Content he gives me, is to abu&s;e me, and u&s;e
me as doggedly as before. I think I &s;hall never
be happy in this World, becau&s;e he hinders my
good, and will ever, I think &s;o; remember (I beg
for God's &s;ake) and get me from this vile Place.</P>

<P>Give <HI>Turner</HI> warning of all Things, but
not the Lord; I would not have any
Thing come out, for fear of my Lord
Trea&s;urer, for &s;o they may tell my
Father and Mother, and fill their ears
full of Noi&s;e.</P>

<P><PB N="194" REF="199">
There were al&s;o &s;hewed in Court certain
Pictures of a Man and Woman in Copulati|on,
made in Lead, as al&s;o the Mould of
Bra&s;s, wherein they were ca&s;t, a black
Scarf al&s;o full of white Cro&s;&s;es, which Mrs.
<HI>Turner</HI> had in her Cu&s;tody; at the &s;hewing
of the&s;e, and inchanted Papers and other
Pictures in Court, there was heard a crack
from the Scaffolds, which cau&s;ed great fear,
tumult, and confu&s;ion among the Specta|tors,
and throughout the Hall, every one
fearing hurt, as if the Devil had been pre|&s;ent,
and grown angry to have his Work|man&s;hip
&s;hewed, by &s;uch as were not his
own Scholars; and this Terror coming, a|bout
a quarter of an Hour after &s;ilence pro|claimed,
the re&s;t of the cunning Tricks
were likewi&s;e &s;hewed.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Forman</HI>'s Wife being Admini&s;tratix of
her Husband, found Letters in Packets, by
which much was di&s;covered; &s;he was in
Court, and depo&s;ed that Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> came
to her Hou&s;e immediately after her Hu&s;|band's
Death, and did demand certain Pi|ctures
which were in her Husband's Study;
namely, one Picture in Wax, very &s;umptu|ou&s;ly
apparalled in Silks and Sattins, as al&s;o
one other &s;itting in form of a naked Woman,
&s;preading, and laying forth her Hair in a
Looking-gla&s;s, which Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> did con|fidently
affirm to be in a Box, and that &s;he
knew in what part or room of the Study
they were.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="200">
Mrs. <HI>Forman</HI> further depo&s;eth, that Mrs.
<HI>Turner</HI> and her Husband would be &s;ometimes
three or four Hours locked up in his Study
together. She did depo&s;e further, that her
Husband had a Ring would open like a
Watch.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a Note &s;hewed in Court,
made by Dr. <HI>Forman,</HI> and written in Parch|ment,
&s;ignifying what Ladies loved what
Lords in the Court, but the Lord Chief Ju|&s;tice
would not &s;uffer it to be read openly in
the Court.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> &s;ent <HI>Margaret,</HI> her Maid, to
Mrs. <HI>Forman,</HI> and wi&s;hed that all &s;uch Let|ters
and Papers as concerned the Earl of <HI>So|mer&s;et,</HI>
or the Counte&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or any o|ther
great Per&s;onages, &s;hould be burned,
telling her that the Council's Warrant &s;hould
come to &s;earch the Study, and that all his
Goods might be &s;eized; whereupon &s;he and
her Maid <HI>Margaret,</HI> with the Con&s;ent of
Mrs. <HI>Forman,</HI> burnt divers Letters and Pa|pers,
but yet &s;he kept &s;ome without their
privity.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o Inchantments &s;hewed in
Court, written in <HI>Parchment,</HI> wherein were
contained all the Names of the Ble&s;&s;ed Tri|nity,
mentioned in the Scriptures; and in
another Parchment, &plus; <HI>B.</HI> &plus; <HI>C.</HI> &plus;. <HI>D.</HI> &plus;
<HI>E.</HI> and in a third likewi&s;e in Parchment were
written all the Names of the Holy Trini|ty;
as al&s;o a Figure, in which was written
<PB N="196" REF="201">
this word, <HI>Corpus,</HI> and upon the Parchment
was fa&s;tned a little piece of the Skin of a
Man.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the&s;e Parchments, the Devils
had particular Names, who were conjured
to torment the Lord <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and Sir <HI>Ar|thur
Manwaring,</HI> if their Loves &s;hould not
continue, the one to the Counte&s;s, the other
to Mrs. <HI>Turner.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, The&s;e faithful Servants of the
<HI>Devil</HI> obtain'd the due Reward of their
Deeds. Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> was &s;erv'd fir&s;t, who
being found guilty of the barbarous Murder
committed upon Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury,</HI> was
Condemn'd for the &s;ame, and Hang'd at
<HI>Tyburn</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day, November</HI> 10. 1615.
Sir <HI>Jarvis Ellowis</HI> was likewi&s;e Hang'd for
the &s;ame on <HI>Monday, November</HI> the 20th
following. The Vi&s;count and Counte&s;s
were likewi&s;e found guilty of the &s;aid Mur|der,
for which they were committed to the
<HI>Tower</HI>; and although the King pardon'd
them, they in a &s;hort Time pined away
their Lives, dying in the utmo&s;t Di&s;grace.
At this Time my Lord of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> little
thought to have been laid in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and
made Heir of <HI>Overbury</HI>'s Bed-chamber;
but by this Cour&s;e we may &s;ee, That <HI>all
Things are in the Hands of God.</HI></P>
