<P>THE COUNTRY GIRL, A COMEDY, (Altered from WYCHERLEY) As it is ACTED at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>

<P>THE De&s;ire of &s;hewing Mi&s;s REYNOLDS to Advantage, was the fir&s;t Motive for attempting an Alteration of WYCHERLEY'S COUNTRY WIFE. Tho' near half of the following Play is new written, the Alterer claims no Merit, but his Endeavour to clear one of our mo&s;t celebrated Comedies from Immorality and Ob&s;cenity. He thought him&s;elf bound to pre&s;erve as much of the O|riginal, as could be pre&s;ented to an Audience of the&s;e Times without Offence; and if this Wanton of CHARLES'S Days is now &s;o re|claimed, as to become innocent without being in&s;iped, the pre&s;ent Editor will not think his Time ill employed, which has enabled him to add &s;ome little Variety to the Entertain|ments of the Publick. There &s;eems indeed an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity for reforming many Plays of our mo&s;t eminent Writers: For no kind of Wit ought to be received as an Excu&s;e for for Immorality, nay it becomes &s;till more dangerous in proportion as it is more witty&mdash;Without &s;uch a Reformation, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Co|medies mu&s;t be reduced to a very &s;mall Num|ber, and would pall by a too frequent Repe|tition, or what is wor&s;e, continue &s;hamele&s;s in &s;pite of publick Di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>Whatever fate this Play may have in the Clo&s;et, it is much indebted to the Prefor|mers for its favourable Reception upon the Stage.</P>

<P>HA, ha, ha! and &s;o you are in love, ne|phew, not rea&s;onably and gallantly, as a young gentleman ought, but &s;ighingly, mi&s;erably &s;o&mdash;not content to be ankle-deep, you have &s;ous'd over head and ears&mdash;ha, Dick?</P>

<P>Nay, never blu&s;h at it&mdash;when I was of your age, I was a&s;ham'd too;&mdash;but three years at College, and half a one at Paris, methinks &s;hould have cur'd you of that unfa&s;hionable weakne&s;s&mdash;mode&s;ty.</P>

nobody's friend, not even his own&mdash;He would thru&s;t him&s;elf into my acquaintance, would introduce me to his mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' I have told him again and again that I was in love with her, which in&s;tead of ridding me of him, has made him only ten times more trouble&s;ome&mdash;and me really in love&mdash;He &s;hould &s;uffer for his &s;elf|&s;ufficiency.</P>

<P>No great hopes,&mdash;and yet, if I could defer the marriage a few days, I &s;hould not de&s;pair;&mdash;her ho|nour, I am confident, is her only attachment to my ri|val&mdash;&s;he can't like Sparki&s;h, and if I can work upon his credulity, a credulity which even popery would be a&s;ham'd of, I may yet have the chance of throwing &s;ixes upon the dice to &s;ave me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I run great ri&s;ques to be &s;ure to &s;erve the young lady, and you, Sir&mdash;but I know you are a gentleman of honour, and wou'd &s;corn to betray a friend who means you well, and is above being mer|cenary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you are not mercenary, Mrs. Lucy, I ought to be the more generous&mdash;give me leave to pre|&s;ent you with this trifle, <STAGE>[gives a ring.]</STAGE> not as a re|ward for &s;ervices, but as a &s;mall token of friend&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I &s;corn to be brib'd in any cau&s;e, yet I am proud to accept it, as a mark of your regard, and as &s;uch &s;hall keep it for your &s;ake&mdash;and now to bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flatter me then, that Mi&s;s Peggy has the mo&s;t rooted aver&s;ion for her guardian, and &s;ome preju|dices in my favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has intru&s;ted me with her very thoughts&mdash;and I have rais'd her di&s;obedience to &s;uch a pitch,
<PB N="53" REF="52">
that &s;he would have open'd her whole heart to you in a letter, had we not been interrupted by her brutal guardian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>She told me in the Park, that you had con|vinced her &s;he was not married to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was not much difficulty in that; but if any thing could have frighten'd her into that belief, her filthy guardian had done it&mdash;He made her almo&s;t believe, that the &s;aving her &s;oul depended upon mar|rying him&mdash;Did you ever hear of &s;uch a reprobate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>How I adore her bewitching &s;implicity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simplicity, Sir! &s;he's able to make a fool of any of us&mdash;if I had half her wit, I would not conti|nue long in &s;ervice, as well as I love my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Lucy, what can Mi&s;s Peggy pro|po&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To run away from her guardian, and marry you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>She might have done both, and lo&s;t the op|portunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will do both, and make an opportunity, if it does not come of it&s;elf. The thought of running away, or of being married, when taken &s;eparately, will put any maiden of us into great confu&s;ion; but when they come both together, are too much for the bolde&s;t of us&mdash;Mi&s;s Peggy was overpower'd with your pro|po&s;al, and no wonder &s;he could not determine for the be&s;t; I &s;hould have been a little frighten'd my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But has the dear creature re&s;olv'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has &s;he&mdash;why, &s;he will run away and mar|ry you, in &s;pite of your teeth, the fir&s;t moment &s;he can break pri&s;on&mdash;&s;o you, in your turn, mu&s;t take care not to have your qualms&mdash;I have known &s;everal bold gentlemen not able to draw their &s;words, when a chal|lenge has come too quick upon 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Mrs. Lucy, that I am no bully in love, and Mi&s;s Peggy will meet with her match, come when &s;he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o you all &s;ay, but talking does no bu&s;i|ne&s;s&mdash;&s;tay at home till you hear from us.</P>

<P>I'm &s;tupify'd with &s;hame, rage, and a&s;to|ni&s;hment&mdash;my fate has o'ercome me&mdash;I can &s;truggle no more with it. <STAGE>[&s;ighs.]</STAGE> What is left me?&mdash;I cannot bear to look, or be look'd upon&mdash;I will hur|ry down to my old hou&s;e; take a twelvemonth's pro|vi&s;ion into it&mdash;cut down my draw-bridge, run wild about my garden, which &s;hall grow as wild as my&s;elf&mdash;then will I cur&s;e the world, and every indivi|dual in it&mdash;and when my rage and &s;pirits fail me, I will be found dead among the nettles and thi&s;tles; a woeful example of the ba&s;ene&s;s and treachery of one &s;ex, and of the fal&s;ehood, lying perjury, deceit, im|pudence and&mdash;damnation of the other.</P>

Bud was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, and grown &s;o thrifty,</L>

<L>Have I, pray Ladies &s;peak, done very wrong?</L>
