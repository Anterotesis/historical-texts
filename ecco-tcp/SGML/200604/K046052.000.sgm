<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK, PRINCE of WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Honour YOUR ROYAL HIGH|NESS has done me in the Pro|tection you was plea&s;ed to give to this Tragedy, emboldens me to lay it now at your Feet, and beg your Permi&s;&s;ion to publi&s;h it under your Royal Patro|nage. The Favouring and Protecting of Letters has been, in all Ages and Countries, one di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of a great Prince; and That with good rea|&s;on, not only as it &s;hews a Ju&s;tne&s;s of Ta&s;te, and Elevation of Mind, but as
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
the Influence of &s;uch a Protection, by ex|citing good Writers to labour with more Emulation in the Improvement of their &s;everal Talents, not a little contributes to the Embelli&s;hment, and In&s;truction of Society. But of all the different Species of Writing, none has &s;uch an Effect upon the Lives and Manners of Men, as the Dramatick; and therefore That of all others mo&s;t de&s;erves the Attention of Princes, who by a judi|cious Approbation of &s;uch Pieces as tend to promote all Publick and Private Virtue, may more than by any coercive Methods &s;ecure the Purity of the Stage, and in con&s;e|quence thereof greatly advance the Morals and Politene&s;s of their People. How eminently YOUR ROYAL HIGH|NESS has always extended your Favour and Patronage to every Art and Science, and in a particular Manner to Drama|tick Performances, is too well known to the World for me to mention it here. Allow me only to wi&s;h, that what I have now the Honour to offer your
<PB N="v" REF="5">
ROYAL HIGHNESS may be judged not unworthy of your Protection, at lea&s;t in the <HI>Sentiments</HI> which it inculcates. A warm and grateful Sen&s;e of your Goodne&s;s to me makes me de&s;irous to &s;eize every Occa&s;ion of declaring in Publick, with what profound Re&s;pect and dutiful Attachment, I am,</P>

<L>Now, even the Senate &s;eldom we convene;</L>
<L>The yawning Fathers nod behind the Scene.</L>
<L>Your Ta&s;te rejects the glittering fal&s;e Sublime,</L>
<L>To &s;igh in Metaphor, and die in Rhime.</L>

<L>Thrice happy! could we catch great <HI>SHAKESPEAR</HI>'s Art,</L>
<L>To trace the deep Rece&s;&s;es of the Heart;</L>
<L>His &s;imple plain Sublime, to which is given</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by MISS BUDGELL.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>CRamm'd to the Throat with whole&s;ome moral Stuff,</L>
<L>Alas! poor Audience! you have had enough.</L>
<L>Was ever haple&s;s Heroine of a Play</L>
<L>In &s;uch a piteous Plight as ours To-day?</L>
<L>Was ever Woman &s;o by Love betray'd?</L>
<L>Match'd with two Hu&s;bands, and yet&mdash;die a Maid.</L>
<L>But ble&s;s me!&mdash;hold&mdash;What Sounds are the&s;e I hear!&mdash;</L>
<L>I &s;ee the <HI>TRAGIC MUSE</HI> her&s;elf appear.</L>
</LG>
<P>The Back-Scene opens, and di&s;covers a romantic Silvan Land|&s;kip; from which Mrs. CIBBER, in the Character of the TRAGIC MUSE, advances &s;lowly to Mu&s;ick, and &s;peaks the following Lines.</P>
<LG>
<L>Hence with your flippant Epilogue, that tries</L>
<L>To wipe the virtuous Tear from <HI>BRITISH</HI> Eyes;</L>
<L>That dares my moral Tragic Scene profane,</L>
<L>With Strains&mdash;at be&s;t, un&s;uiting, light and vain.</L>
<L>Hence from the pure un&s;ully'd Beams that play</L>
<L>In yon fair Eyes, where Virtue &s;hines&mdash;Away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>BRITONS,</HI> to you from cha&s;te <HI>Ca&s;talian</HI> Groves,</L>
<L>Where dwell the tender, oft unhappy Loves;</L>
<L>Where Shades of Heroes roam, each mighty Name,</L>
<L>And court my Aid to ri&s;e again to Fame;</L>
<L>To you I come, to Freedom's noble&s;t Seat,</L>
<L>And in <HI>BRITANNIA</HI> fix my la&s;t Retreat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>GREECE,</HI> and <HI>ROME,</HI> I watch'd the Publick Weal;</L>
<L>The purple Tyrant trembled at my Steel:</L>
<L>Nor did I le&s;s o'er private Sorrows reign,</L>
<L>And mend the melting Heart with &s;ofter Pain.</L>
<L>On <HI>FRANCE</HI> and <HI>YOU</HI> then ro&s;e my brightning Star,</L>
<L>With &s;ocial Ray&mdash;The <HI>ARTS</HI> are ne'er at War.</L>
<L>O as your Fire and Genius &s;tronger blaze,</L>
<L>As yours are generous Freedom's bolder Lays,</L>
<L>Let not the <HI>Gallick</HI> Ta&s;te leave yours behind,</L>
<L>In decent Manners and in Life refin'd;</L>
<L>Bani&s;h the motley Mode, to tag low Ver&s;e,</L>
<L>The laughing Ballad to the mournful Her&s;e.</L>
<L>When thro' five Acts your Hearts have learnt to glow,</L>
<L>Touch'd with the &s;acred Force of hone&s;t Woe;</L>
<L>O keep the dear Impre&s;&s;ion on your Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Nor idly lo&s;e it for a wretched Je&s;t!</L>
