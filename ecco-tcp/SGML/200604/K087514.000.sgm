<HEAD>To his Royal Highne&s;s THE PRINCE, Lord High Admiral of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<P>THE following Propo&s;al for the Se|curing of Commerce, could be no where &s;o properly addre&s;s'd as to your Royal Highne&s;s, who in your exalted Station can do nothing at pre&s;ent that will be more for the Se|curity of the&s;e Kingdoms, or for your own Glory, than the protecting and maintaining our Trade. The <HI>French</HI> by their practice in the pre&s;ent War will &s;hew, that it's their Opinion that they can do
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
nothing more fatal to the&s;e Nations, than the ruining their Traffick. For which rea&s;on I hum|bly conceive they will not pretend to engage us at Sea; but laying up their Capital Ships, will in|fe&s;t us with their Privateers, and their Crui&s;ers. And indeed, why &s;hould they run the Risk of engaging us, when they can de&s;troy us without it? For by ruining our Commerce, our Navigation &s;inks, our Seamen are lo&s;t, and our Royal Fleet in a very few Years mu&s;t by con&s;equence fall. The <HI>French</HI> therefore, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your Royal Highne&s;s, will not pretend to engage us; for &s;hould they get the better of us, they have not lei&s;ure at the pre&s;ent juncture to invade us, and can reap no Advantage from their Victory, but what they may have in a great degree without it, and that is the de&s;troying our Trade; which if they can promi&s;e them&s;elves to do, they need not run the hazard at pre&s;ent of an Inva&s;ion, tho they had Lei&s;ure and Troops to attempt it; for from the de&s;truction of our Traffick they may promi&s;e them&s;elves all the Advantages which they could reap from an Inva&s;ion, without running the risk of it. And whereas an Inva&s;ion would be expen&s;ive, as well as hazardous, this other way will be gainful as well as certain; &s;ince the ruin of our Commerce will impoveri&s;h us, and
<PB N="v" REF="4">
de&s;pirit us, and bringing us up tame to their hands, will conquer us without a Blow. For our Traffick by frequent Lo&s;&s;es will be di&s;courag'd and daily le&s;&s;en'd, and the diminution of that will decrea&s;e our Manufactures; the decay of which will augment the Number of the Poor, make the Tenants le&s;s able to pay their Rents, and render the Taxes at length intolerable. Since therefore 'tis plain, that the only De&s;ign which the <HI>French</HI> have again&s;t us at pre&s;ent, is to ru|in our Commerce, I leave it to be determin'd by your Royal Highne&s;s whether it ought not to be our chief care to de&s;troy theirs and to pre&s;erve our own; which if we can effect, we may be &s;ure of the Victory without running the venture for it, and barely &s;upporting our Al|lies, and acting defen&s;ively on the Continent, may in a few Years &s;ee the numerous Armies of our Enemies con&s;um'd and lo&s;t by Famine.</P>
<P>But that the Royal Navy of <HI>England</HI> alone is not &s;ufficient to maintain our Trade, and to de|&s;troy theirs, is plain, becau&s;e it never has done it. For &s;ince in the &s;eparate War which we formerly had with <HI>Spain,</HI> and in that which we lately had with <HI>France,</HI> our Lo&s;&s;es by Sea were very grie|vous, notwith&s;tanding our formidable Squa|drons, and our numerous Crui&s;ers, how &s;hould
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
tho&s;e Squadrons and Crui&s;ers prevent them in the War in which we are at pre&s;ent engag'd again&s;t tho&s;e potent Kingdoms united? To prevent our Lo&s;&s;es, and to augment theirs, I &s;hould be apt to believe requires an Additional and a Proportion'd Force. And I leave it to your Royal Highne&s;s to con&s;ider whether it is not rea&s;onable, at the time we are making &s;uch va&s;t preparations again&s;t their Grand Squadrons which will not appear to engage us, that &s;ome effectual Provi&s;ion &s;hould be made again&s;t tho&s;e Robbers which will certain|ly appear to plunder us. I thought it might be for the Service of the Queen and your Royal Highne&s;s, to offer you a Hint of &s;uch a Provi|&s;ion, by an additional and well-proportion'd Force. If that Hint is barely good, your Royal High|ne&s;s will ea&s;ily &s;ee that it is highly important: For if the <HI>French</HI> by means of their Privateers can &s;o grievou&s;ly endamage our Trade, at the very time that their Grand Fleet dares not &s;hew it &s;elf on the Ocean; I leave it to your Royal Highne&s;s to con&s;ider what a terrible Ravage we mu&s;t make in their Traffick, by employing &s;uch a &s;ubordinate Force as will be mention'd here|after: By imploying &s;uch a Force, I &s;ay, at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Dutch</HI> and we with our Grand Squadrons, under the au&s;picious Conduct
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
of your Royal Highne&s;s, ride the unque&s;tioned Ma&s;ters of the Main.</P>
<P>If your Royal Highne&s;s approves of the follow|ing Hint, it can never enter into the Great Council by a more valuable Recommendation, as is plain to all the World by the extraordinary Te&s;timony which they are giving of their E&s;teem for You: and the E&s;teem which tho&s;e awful A&s;&s;emblies have &s;hewn for You, is a convincing proof that your Royal Highne&s;s, tho born a &s;tranger to us, has not only liv'd for &s;o many Years with an unblemi&s;h'd Character among a People who are generally thought to be aver&s;e to Strangers, but that the Reputation of your Virtue has gain'd the Affections of all <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> even to the remote&s;t parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The protecting and maintaining our Commerce, will not fail to advance your Royal Highne&s;s's Intere&s;t, and to augment your Glory: For if &s;uch Cries, &s;uch Clamours, nay &s;uch Cur&s;es were utter'd again&s;t &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty in the late Reigns, for &s;uffering by their Malice, or their Mi&s;management, our trad|ing Ve&s;&s;els to become a Prey to our Enemies; What numberle&s;s Ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t be heap'd upon your Royal Highne&s;s, by a happy People flou|ri&s;hing in their Commerce under your au&s;picious Conduct?</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">
To detain you no longer, I conclude with my zealous wi&s;hes for the Pro&s;perity of the Queen and your Royal Highne&s;s. May &s;he long reign in the Hearts of all her People, and You reign long in Hers; and while She with Mildne&s;s governs the Land, may your Highne&s;s with Terror con|troul the Main, and appear, to the Confu&s;ion of our Enemies, the dreadful Wonder of God in the Deep. May both the Queen and your Royal Highne&s;s find all her Subjects as &s;trongly in|clin'd, but much more able to &s;erve you, than,</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSALS</HEAD>
<HEAD>For putting a &s;peedy End to the War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT it is the joint Intere&s;t of all the Confederates to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Efforts for the putting a &s;peedy End to the pre&s;ent War, is plain from hence, That a Delay will probably be more favourable to the <HI>French</HI> than it will be to us: For wherever there is a War between a Confederate Power on the one &s;ide, and an united Ab&s;olute one on the other, Time (if there is any proportion of Strength between them) mu&s;t &s;ubject the Confederate to more Contingencies than it can the Single Ab&s;olute Power.</P>
<P>The making a very great Effort at Sea, will be more effectual on our part towards the &s;peedy end|ing of the War, than the &s;ending formidable For|ces to <HI>Flanders,</HI> or any part of the Continent, be|cau&s;e at Land we run a greater Risk, and the Gain is not &s;o &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have more numerous Armies than we; and tho&s;e Armies are very well di&s;ciplin'd; and they have a great many more impregnable
<PB N="6" REF="9">
Gari&s;ons. From which it is evident, that we run a Hazard at Land whether we &s;hall be victorious or not; and if we are, the Gain of &s;everal Bat|tels may not conclude the War.</P>
<P>At Sea the ca&s;e is va&s;tly different, for there we need run little or no risk of the Enemy, un|le&s;s we plea&s;e our &s;elves; this being a thing that is never to be que&s;tioned, That if the <HI>Dutch</HI> and we will make an Effort, we may be Ma&s;ters of the Sea.</P>
<P>Now this is certain, That if we can continue entirely Ma&s;ters of the Sea, we mu&s;t put a &s;pee|dy End to the War; for our entire Command o'er the Seas mu&s;t ruin our Enemys Commerce, and that utterly. Now Commerce is the only Fountain of Trea&s;ure in Countries that have no Mines; and Silver and Gold, are the only Si|news of War; which Sinews, when they hap|pen to be cut off, or to be very much ob&s;tructed, the Body Politick becomes of a &s;udden either Maim'd, Impotent, or Paralytick.</P>
<P>But then this at the &s;ame time mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, That they only are entire Ma&s;ters of the Sea who can command it ab&s;olutely; and they alone can be &s;aid to command it ab&s;olutely, who make their Maritime Power an&s;wer all the Ends for which it was de&s;igned; and the&s;e are the Defence of their Coa&s;ts, the Security of their own Com|merce, and the Ruin of that of their Ene|mies.</P>
<P>From which it is plain, that our pre&s;ent Ma|ritime Forces are in&s;ufficient to render us entirely Ma&s;ters of the Seas; for being unable to protect
<PB N="7" REF="10">
us from the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, they cannot &s;ecure our Commerce. But that they are unable to protect us from the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, is evident, not only from Matter of Fact, and the va&s;t num|ber of Ve&s;&s;els that we lo&s;t in the late War, not|with&s;tanding that we had above one hundred Men of War equipp'd on our own part, but from the nature of the thing it &s;elf: for the <HI>French</HI> Privateers being &s;o much &s;maller, and lighter, at lea&s;t for the generality, than our Ships of War which cruize upon them, are con&s;equently &s;o much &s;wifter; and not drawing half the Quantity of Water which the Cruizers draw, are by that means enabled to e&s;cape from them in &s;hole Water, be&s;ides that our Fleet of War is obliged for the mo&s;t part to act united.</P>
<P>But if it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure our own Com|merce with our pre&s;ent Maritime Power, it is by con&s;equence impo&s;&s;ible to ruin that of the Enemy; for their Robberies upon the Seas are equivalent to them (at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure) to Commerce: For by means of the afore&s;aid Robberies they import tho&s;e Commodities into <HI>France,</HI> for which their Enemies trade for nothing; be&s;ides that by this method they &s;upply them|&s;elves with Ships. So that our pre&s;ent Maritime Power being in&s;ufficient to ruin the Enemies Commerce utterly, and by that means to ener|vate the Sinews of War, is by con&s;equence in|&s;ufficient to put a &s;peedy End to that War.</P>
<P>But that it is in our Power, with an additional Maritime Force, to &s;ecure our Commerce and ruin that of the Enemies, and &s;o to become intirely Ma&s;ters
<PB N="8" REF="11">
of the Seas, may (I believe) appear from hence, that having more Ships of every Burden, and more Seamen than the <HI>French,</HI> we are as able to make an effectual Provi&s;ion again&s;t their Pirats and Robbers, as again&s;t their Fleet of War; by which we at once &s;ecure our Trade, and ruin that of our Enemies, nay, and ruin it in all the Branches of it; not only cutting off their Cor|re&s;pondence between the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> but that which they al&s;o at pre&s;ent maintain be|tween one part of <HI>Europe</HI> and another.</P>
<P>To &s;hew how this may brought to pa&s;s, is the end of the en&s;uing Lines: In order to the doing which, I &s;hall treat of the following Points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew, what Number of Ships, of what Bigne&s;s, and how Armed, mu&s;t be pro|vided for the compa&s;&s;ing this De&s;ign.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall enquire into the Expence of &s;etting them forth.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall di&s;cover a Method to defray that Expence, without taxing the People.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew how the&s;e Ships are to be u&s;ed and di&s;pos'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fifthly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew the Advantage which may be reap'd from them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sixthly,</HI> I &s;hall an&s;wer &s;ome Objections.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">
<HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, Be&s;ides the Grand Royal Fleet, which in conjunction with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> we &s;uppo&s;e to be more than an equal Match for the whole <HI>French</HI> Royal Navy; not only in the <HI>Channel,</HI> but in the <HI>Straits</HI> too, and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> ac|cording to the &s;everal Squadrons: We next &s;up|po&s;e a &s;ubordinate Fleet to be equipp'd, which for the mo&s;t part is to act di&s;tinctly from the other, and to con&s;i&s;t of two hundred Ve&s;&s;els <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and two hundred <HI>Dutch,</HI> the be&s;t Sailers that the Queen and the States can light of, all of them containing one with another two hundred Tuns a Ve&s;&s;el; the whole to be arm'd with ten thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and ten thou&s;and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are to be a fifth part Ma|riners, and the re&s;t Marines. The Number of Guns in every Ve&s;&s;el to be proportioned to the bigne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;el, and the Number of the Men. The Captain of every Ve&s;&s;el to have the Queen's and the State's Commi&s;&s;ions, by which they are to be authoriz'd to &s;cowr the Seas of Privateers and Pirats: But they who have the Queen's Commi&s;&s;i|ons, are not like the Ve&s;&s;els of the great Fleet to carry the Royal Flag, becau&s;e in ca&s;e of a manife&s;t Di&s;advantage they are to be allowed to run, which the Honour of <HI>England</HI> will not allow to the Flag.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;ay &s;omething of the Expence of Equipping this Fleet; and without pretending to an exact Calculation, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with coming &s;omething near to it. Let us allow then 200000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> for the Hire of the Ships for
<PB N="10" REF="13">
our part of the Expence, and as much for the <HI>Dutch</HI>; and 300000<HI>l. per annum</HI> for us, and as much for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for the Wages of the Men, their Provi&s;ion and Ammunition: and having done that, let us proceed to the Method of defray|ing &s;o con&s;iderable a Charge.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more natural than to conclude, that &s;ince this additional Expence is originally and immediately employ'd for the defence of the Mer|chants, that they &s;hould be oblig'd to defray it, who principally derive their Security from it. 'Tis true, the whole Nation will &s;hare in the De|fence which they will receive from it; but the Merchants will have the principal Share in the Gain, of which it is but rea&s;onable that they &s;hould contribute a part to &s;upport it, e&s;pecially &s;ince they will derive the Security of their Gain from that very Contribution. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then, that every one &s;hould be oblig'd to en&s;ure at the rate of 5<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Exports, and 10<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Imports, (take one Place with ano|ther) and that this In&s;urance Mony, according to the value of Imports and Exports, as they have been valued by late Computations, the Imports at between &s;even and eight Millions, and the Ex|ports at between four and five, will amount to a Million of <HI>Sterling</HI> Mony. So that 500000<HI>l.</HI> be|ing allow'd on our part, and as much on that of the <HI>Dutch</HI> for the Hire of the Ships, the Wa|ges of the Men, their Ammunition and Provi&s;ion, there remains 500000<HI>l.</HI> to us, and 500000<HI>l.</HI> to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to make good the Lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
But now as every Merchant is oblig'd to en|&s;ure, the Queen is &s;uppos'd to become the Gene|ral En&s;urer for us, and the States for the <HI>Dutch:</HI> And this En&s;urance Mony is to be paid down at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, at the &s;ame time with the Cu&s;|toms, to prevent a new Creation of Officers, which may be trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive. But one thing I forgot to add, That tho the Queen is &s;uppos'd to be General En&s;urer, yet &s;he is always to except the Danger of the Sea it &s;elf, for Rea|&s;ons &s;o obvious, that they are needle&s;s to be in|&s;i&s;ted on here, and is only to en&s;ure the Mer|chants again&s;t all Captures; and that the other En|&s;urance again&s;t the Danger of the Seas, may be practis'd by tho&s;e who undertake it in time of Peace. But then in ca&s;e it would be more for the Queen's Convenience, that &s;ome of the En&s;u|rance Mony for the Imports &s;hould be paid at the re&s;pective Foreign Ports from which the Ships &s;et forth, becau&s;e this Method in &s;ome places, parti|cularly in the <HI>Straits,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> may &s;ave the Queen the trouble and charge, and delay of Remittances in that ca&s;e; it may be provided that the Mony be paid to the Queen's Governor, or Con&s;ul re&s;iding at or near the re&s;pective Ports; and that Debentures may be given by the afore|&s;aid Governors or Con&s;uls, to the Value of each Receipt.</P>
<P>I come to &s;hew how this &s;ubordinate Fleet may be imploy'd and di&s;pos'd for the Service of the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
I &s;uppo&s;e then that 30 of them &s;hould be always crui&s;ing in the Seas between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>; twenty between <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> which takes in <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; five between <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Haver de Grace</HI>; five between <HI>Haver de Grace</HI> and <HI>La Hogue</HI>; be|fore <HI>St. Malo</HI> twenty; in the Chops of the Chan|nel and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Seas forty; South We&s;t of <HI>Ire|land</HI> twenty; <HI>Bay of Bi&s;cay</HI> thirty; Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain</HI> in the Ocean thirty; which Numbers com|puted make two hundred in all. The remain|ing two hundred are to be thus employ'd; An hundred of them are to accompany the Royal Squadron to the <HI>Straits,</HI> there to &s;eparate from, and to act di&s;tinctly (unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity require o|therwi&s;e) and fifty to cruize in the <HI>Mediterrane|an</HI>; thirty in the <HI>Gulf of Venice,</HI> and twenty in the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> The remaining hundred to be thus di&s;pos'd of; Three&s;core and ten of them to be &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> fifty of them to act on the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Spani&s;h-Indies,</HI> in conjunction with the Buccaneers; and the other twenty on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>New-York</HI>; and the remaining thirty are to be &s;ent to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Gambo.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now &s;ay a word concerning the Ad|vantage which we &s;hould receive from employ|ing &s;o numerous a Force in the foremention'd man|ner.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We &s;hall by this means effectually &s;e|cure our Commerce; for if during the late War, we did not lo&s;e above one Ship in four, in the time of the greate&s;t Mi&s;management,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
it is very probable we &s;hall not lo&s;e above one in twenty now.</P>
<P>If there &s;hould be no mi&s;management in the pre&s;ent War, yet our Grand Fleet would never be able wholly to &s;ecure our Commerce; for the <HI>French</HI> Privateers would be too nimble for our Men of War, and our own Privateers (if we &s;hould &s;et out any) would &s;carce ever attack tho&s;e of the Enemy; but it would be the main part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;ubordinate Fleet to attack the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, and if it were &s;up|ported and &s;u&s;tained by our Cruizers, we have no rea&s;on to doubt, but that in a very little time it would be able to clear the Seas of them; &s;o that by this Method, in all probability, we &s;hould &s;ave the Nation tho&s;e va&s;t Sums, which our Lo&s;&s;es would otherwi&s;e amount to. Be&s;ides, as by this means we &s;hould &s;ecure our Commerce, we &s;hould expedite Trade, and by di&s;patching it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure double it, becau&s;e none of our trading Ve&s;&s;els would be oblig'd to &s;tay for Convoys.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As by this means we &s;hould &s;ecure our own Commerce, we &s;hould ruin that of the <HI>French</HI>; and I leave it to any one to judg, Whe|ther fifty of the&s;e Ships in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> acting in concert with the Buccaneers, and di&s;tinctly from our Royal Squadron (unle&s;s there &s;hould prove at any time a nece&s;&s;ity for their acting joint|ly) would not cut off all manner of Intercour&s;e between <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and hinder the Importation of Bullion, and the Pa&s;|&s;age of their Plate Fleets? by which alone they
<PB N="14" REF="17">
can pretend to be formidable: And whether it would not prove the mo&s;t effectual Method for the &s;eizing upon &s;everal Places there, which at the end of the War remaining our own by Treaty, would &s;erve to defray the Charges of it? Be&s;ides, I leave it to any to con&s;ider, whether the Royal Squadron to be &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> acting (as it might do) upon an Emergency in con|cert with this additional Force, might not &s;eize upon the mo&s;t important Places which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> hold in tho&s;e Parts?</P>
<P>By the Squadron of the&s;e &s;ubordinate Ships, which we &s;hould have in the <HI>Straits</HI> (di&s;tinctly by our Men of War) the <HI>Dutch</HI> and We &s;hould be enabled to &s;ecure the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade to our &s;elves; we &s;hould, as it were, inve&s;t the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> and be in&s;trumental in redu|cing them to the Emperor's Party; rai&s;e the Cre|dit of the Emperor with the Port, and &s;ink the Reputation of the <HI>French</HI>; prey on both &s;ides the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, not only upon the <HI>Mediter|ranean</HI> Coa&s;ts adjacent to <HI>O&s;tia</HI> and <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> but likewi&s;e upon the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Shore, adjoining to <HI>Ce&s;ennate, Pe&s;aro, Ravenna, Ancona, Rimini,</HI> &amp;c. encourage the <HI>Venetians</HI> to declare for the right Side, and be a terrible Awe upon the re&s;t of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes. This Squadron cruizing in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> whil&s;t the Royal Squadron ob&s;erv'd the <HI>French,</HI> would lamentably hara&s;s the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts, and utterly intercept their Trade, while that in the Ocean would hinder the Inter|cour&s;e between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and be a &s;evere Bridle upon the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>

To come nearer home, the <HI>French</HI> would have no Corre&s;pondence by Sea between one part of <HI>France</HI> and another. Their Coa&s;ters in all likelihood would be a perpetual Prey to us: No|thing could be tran&s;ported from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> or from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> unle&s;s it &s;hould be by Land-Carriage, which would put the <HI>French</HI> King to a prodigious Expence; be&s;ides, we &s;hould hinder their Traffick to <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Hamborough,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Northern Ports, from which they have not only their Naval Stores, but their be&s;t Timber.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, we &s;hould &s;ecure our <HI>Newcastle</HI> Trade, and &s;o provide in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the Relief of the Poor, and defend and &s;upport the Fi&s;hery both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> intercept the Commerce of our Enemies here, and of tho&s;e in <HI>France</HI>; interrupt the nightly Traffick of our Owlers, which is &s;o prejudicial to the Woollen Manufacture, and prevent and ob&s;truct all manner of Smugling and running of Goods, and &s;o advance the Cu&s;toms; &s;u&s;tain the Commerce of our We&s;|tern Ports, which in the late War were ruin'd, either for want of Convoys, or by too high an In&s;urance. All this we might do by this additional Force rightly manag'd, and according to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Time and Place &s;upported and back'd by our Cruizers. Be&s;ides, the&s;e &s;ubordinate Ve&s;|&s;els repairing to our Coa&s;ts upon any Nece&s;&s;ity, as to <HI>Deal, Sandwich,</HI> or the like, while Winter con&s;trains our great Ships to keep the Harbour, might prove an admirable Outwork to our Royal Navy, which is the natural Bulwark of <HI>England.</HI>

Moreover, they might be &s;erviceable in tran&s;|porting our Soldiers to any of the Coa&s;ts of <HI>France,</HI> or be made in&s;trumental in bombarding any of their Ports; and the Marines by frequent De&s;cents might continually &s;poil their Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>To all this I might add, that by employing the Marines de&s;igned for this Subordinate Fleet, we &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a numerous Nur&s;ery of Seamen; who as &s;oon as the War is over, may be made u&s;e of in recovering the Fi&s;hery of <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Newfound land,</HI> and re&s;toring the Northern Fi&s;he|ry.</P>

<ITEM>The Second, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> would not com|ply with it.</ITEM>

<ITEM>The Fourth, That the Mony &s;et apart for the making good the Lo&s;&s;es, might prove in&s;uf|ficient, and &s;o bring the Nation more into Debt.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the Merchants would think this a Hard&s;hip upon them. To which I an&s;wer, That this way of proceeding would make the Mer|chants Gain more certain, tho it might not make it &s;o great. If the Pre&s;&s;ure upon them were to be
<PB N="17" REF="20">
intolerable, nay very grievous or perpetual, we might be enclin'd to bear with their Complaints, and to indulge the Frailties of Human Nature: But &s;ince they are to be but &s;light, we mu&s;t beg leave to tell them, that at a time when their Religion, their Liberty, nay the whole of that very Proper|ty, for a trifling part of which they appear &s;o much concern'd, is at &s;take, they &s;hew them&s;elves unrea&s;onable to &s;et an incon&s;iderable Overplus of &s;ordid Gain in the Ballance again&s;t all this; nay, they proceed contrary to the Maxims by which they are guided even in their own Commerce; for they make nothing of hazarding five hundred Pounds, that they may draw a thou&s;and home from the <HI>Indies.</HI> How then can they rea&s;onably murmur at the paying a &s;mall Sum to the Queen, which will not much burden them, for the Securi|ty of all which they are to trade during the War, and all they inherited or acquired before, e&s;pecially &s;ince this is a Maxim among them, <HI>that what is &s;av'd, is got?</HI> But they are but a Part of that great Body, the <HI>People,</HI> and they ought not to repine at any little Inconvenience, if it tends to the Defence of the <HI>Whole</HI>; becau&s;e the <HI>whole</HI> can never be ruin'd, but the Parts too mu&s;t be de|&s;troy'd. If there remain any few among them, who are &s;o unrea&s;onable as not to be &s;atisfy'd with what has been &s;aid, they are de&s;ir'd to con&s;ider, that they are but a Part of the whole Body of the Merchants, and it is unrea&s;onable in them to re|pine at what the State thinks nece&s;&s;ary for the De|fence of them&s;elves and their Brethren, and the common Security of Trade. But to make this Unrea&s;onablene&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="21">
appear &s;till greater, I &s;hall con&s;ider them in their different Capacity, for all the Mer|chants by the pre&s;ent War are reduced under one of the&s;e three Heads; They who are In&s;urers; They who In&s;ure; Or they who run the Ven|ture.</P>
<P>1. They who are In&s;urers, will infallibly op|po&s;e this De&s;ign, becau&s;e it will oppo&s;e their Gain: But the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the&s;e People will appear from hence, that they have a mind to be the only Gainers by what the Publick does for the Security of Trade; for even in the condition in which things are at pre&s;ent, tho&s;e Ships which will be pre&s;erved, mu&s;t be protected by our Men of War, and therefore I think it very unrea&s;ona|ble that the Government &s;hould be at the Charge of &s;ending out Convoys to protect the Merchants, and that the <HI>Jews</HI> (for &s;uch in the late War were mo&s;t of the In&s;urers) &s;hould be paid for it; for I hope no one believes that they can contribute any thing to the Security of any one Ship for which they may underwrite. But their Unrea&s;onablene&s;s may appear yet further from this, That the&s;e Peo|ple are for hazarding the Publick in hope of their private Gain. In our late War, &s;everal of our mo&s;t con&s;iderable Merchants left off their Trade to turn In&s;urers, I mean, either left it vvholly off, or in a great part; by vvhich there followed two Inconveniences to the Publick: for, fir&s;t, the Ex|tent of the Trade vvas reduc'd to a narrow com|pa&s;s; and, &s;econdly, the King's Cu&s;toms vvere con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en'd. And will the&s;e Men have the face to tell the Government that they ought
<PB N="19" REF="22">
to reject the pre&s;ent De&s;ign, becau&s;e their im|bracing it would infallibly put the&s;e People out of capacity of doing the Publick the &s;ame Mi&s;chief again?</P>
<P>But now let us come to tho&s;e who in ca&s;e of a War are re&s;olv'd to In&s;ure: And for the&s;e Gen|tlemen I de&s;ire only in &s;hort to ask them two or three Que&s;tions. Fir&s;t, Whether they had ra|ther the Queen and the Publick &s;hould get that Mony which they are re&s;olv'd to part with for their private Security, or a few private Per&s;ons who have no relation at all to, and perhaps are mere &s;trangers to them? Secondly, Whether they had rather part with their Mony to tho&s;e who can &s;ecure them, or who cannot? The Government is &s;olvable in ca&s;e of Lo&s;s, whereas private Men often fail; no &s;ort of People in the late War be|ing more known to break, than the Body of In|&s;urers. But &s;uppo&s;ing they do not, private Men at the be&s;t can &s;ecure but the prime Co&s;t, &s;uppo|&s;ing the Dealing to be direct and fair between them; nor even the whole prime Co&s;t, becau&s;e the In&s;urers pay but &s;eventy five or eighty Pounds for a hundred; whereas the Government not only &s;ecures the prime Co&s;t, and the whole prime Co&s;t, but by &s;cowring the Seas, according to the &s;cope of the pre&s;ent De&s;ign, &s;ecures their Gain too in a very great degree, and by &s;o doing confirms it &s;elf, which is a double Security to them: for they would have little cau&s;e to boa&s;t of their Gain, if after having thriven in their private Capacity, they &s;hould be undone at la&s;t with the Publick. They ought to con&s;ider then,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
that by In&s;uring with private Per&s;ons, they make no provi&s;ion at all for the Publick, with which they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall; and a very invalid one in the mean while for them&s;elves, becau&s;e pri|vate Per&s;ons who appear to be the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble, are often &s;een to be utterly undone in a mo|ment. Whereas by paying this In&s;urance Mony to the Publick, they make an effectual Provi&s;ion for that, and a valid Security for them&s;elves; be|cau&s;e, by proceeding thus, they are certain not to fall, unle&s;s the Government falls with them, without which they cannot &s;tand. In &s;hort, I de|&s;ire to ask the&s;e Gentlemen, Whether &s;ince the Lo&s;s of every Man, who lives under the Protec|tion of the Government, is a Lo&s;s to the Publick, which no private In&s;urer ever did, or can pretend to make good, it is not very rea&s;onable, nay very natural, that the Publick &s;hould be enabled to provide effectually again&s;t it?</P>
<P>But now let us come to the Merchant-Adven|turer, who neither underwrites, nor in&s;ures, but is re&s;olv'd to run the Risk. He is in a wealthy and &s;anguine Condition, both his Veins and his Coffers are full, and con&s;equently he is enclined to hope the be&s;t; and he is willing to venture, becau&s;e if he &s;ucceeds, his Gain will be more con&s;iderable: 'Tis true, but then &s;o will his Lo&s;s provided he does not &s;ucceed. But Fortune, he &s;ays, has been favourable to him hitherto, and why &s;hould he doubt of her being &s;o for the future? Why, for that very rea&s;on, becau&s;e &s;he has been favourable hitherto; and the Rea&s;on is good, con&s;idering her u&s;ual Incon&s;tancy. He would be a fooli&s;h Game&s;ter
<PB N="21" REF="24">
that &s;hould be confident of his winning in the latter part of the Night, becau&s;e he had Luck in the former. Well, but if he has a Lo&s;s, he is ve|ry well able to bear it; but then he is a great deal better able to bear the In&s;urance Mony, and there|fore ought the le&s;s to repine at it: For &s;ince what|ever he lo&s;es is &s;o much Lo&s;s to the Publick, becau&s;e every Man's &s;ingle Property is infallibly part of the National Stock, I believe it will be found but rea&s;onable, that what he gets &s;hould likewi&s;e be a Gain to the Publick. But that he who is able to bear a Lo&s;s, is better able to bear the In&s;urance, is plain from hence, That during the time of the late War, when the Privateers made mo&s;t havock, there was about one Ship lo&s;t in four, &s;o that but three parts in four, both of the Imports and Exports, went and came &s;afe; whereas the In&s;urance will not amount to above a &s;ixth part of each. Con&s;i|dering that in the pre&s;ent War, our Enemies will be more numerous, and our Ports abroad few|er: we have no rea&s;on to believe that our Lo&s;&s;es will be fewer, unle&s;s we take effectual and timely care, &s;o that our Adventurer may very well lo&s;e one Ship in three; and if Fortune &s;hould prove &s;evere to him, one in two. Since therefore he can|not fore&s;ee the future, is it not a mo&s;t unrea&s;ona|ble thing in him to murmur again&s;t a De&s;ign which will mo&s;t probably be advantageous to him, and may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave him from ruin? So that being unable to authorize his Complaint by Rea&s;on, he has nothing left to ju&s;tify it but his Fancy: And what a plea&s;ant Per&s;on mu&s;t he be, who &s;ets &s;o &s;en&s;le&s;s a thing as his Humor in ballance again&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="25">
the common Security of Traffick, and the Safety of his Country?</P>
<P>But now I come to the next Objection, which is, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> will not fall in with a De&s;ign which is concerted here. In an&s;wer to which I &s;hall only take notice, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> are as immediately con|cern'd (and perhaps more immediately) to put an end to the pre&s;ent War, than we; for it the War &s;hould be protracted 7, or 8, or 10 Years like the la&s;t, &s;everal de&s;tructive Accidents might very well happen in that &s;pace, which would not pro|bably happen in 3 Years. The Queen (whom God long pre&s;erve) may die, &s;o may the Emperor, &s;o may the King of the <HI>Romans</HI>; the&s;e things in &s;even or eight, or ten Years, may fall out, con&s;idering the common condition of Mortality, and the Machinations of our Enemies: And in that ca&s;e, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent Confu&s;ions of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the Di&s;tractions of the <HI>Empire,</HI> what would become of the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of <HI>Holland</HI> particularly? Well then, the <HI>Dutch</HI> are concern'd as immediately, or rather more immedi|ately than we to put a &s;peedy end to the War. Now nothing can put a &s;peedy end to the War, but the entirely ruining the Commerce of the Enemy, and the &s;ecuring our own; and the doing this, in three Years time, would either bring down the <HI>French</HI> to our own Terms, or reduce them to &s;o poor a condition, that if any of the&s;e fatal Ac|cidents &s;hould happen, they would not be able to make their Advantage of them, but like an old Greyhound upon too hot a Cour&s;e, they would
<PB N="23" REF="26">
be forc'd to lie down, and only pant and blow up|on the Prey, which they would not be able to touch. Whether the Expedient above propo&s;ed is &s;ufficient to the compa&s;&s;ing this De&s;ign, I leave to be determin'd by the Impartial Reader: But if this Expedient is &s;ufficient for the ruining the <HI>French</HI> Commerce, and the &s;ecuring our own, why then the <HI>Dutch</HI> would act mo&s;t unrea&s;onably, if at a time when we &s;o chearfully contribute, beyond what we are obliged to by antient Treaties, to their Support and A&s;&s;i&s;tance by Land, where their Dan|ger is &s;o much greater, and &s;o much nearer than ours; they &s;hould refu&s;e to contribute their part to our common Support at Sea, where our Con|cern is equal.</P>
<P>But if it be objected, that mo&s;t of the Forces a|board the&s;e Subordinate Ve&s;&s;els, being to con&s;i&s;t of Landmen, it would be unrea&s;onable to expect that the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould &s;end Land-Forces to Sea, at the very time that they borrow of their Neigh|bours to defend their Frontiers: To that we an|&s;wer, that we may rai&s;e Landmen for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in return &s;upply us with Seamen.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then that the <HI>Dutch</HI> will join with us, I &s;hall proceed to the next Objection, which is, that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Privateers will outnum|ber the fore&s;aid Ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently over|pow'r them. In order to the an&s;wering this, I de|&s;ire leave to take notice of the mo&s;t remarkable Differences in the Con&s;titution (if I may &s;o call it) of the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, and the abovementi|oned Ve&s;&s;els, and then to ob&s;erve what Influence
<PB N="24" REF="27">
tho&s;e Differences mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have on their Action, and on their Conduct.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, The Privateers fight only for their own Intere&s;t, whereas the fore&s;aid Ve&s;&s;els are &s;up|pos'd to fight for their Countries Intere&s;t and their own.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Privateers fight for the mo&s;t part upon this Condition, to have no Purcha&s;e, no Pay; whereas the others are to be in con&s;tant Pay from the Queen.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Privateers have no other incite|ment, than the hopes of immediate Gain, whereas the others will have that, and the Spur of Honour and Ambition be&s;ides; for if they do well in the Queen's Service, they may expect Advancement from Her. From which differences in their Con&s;ti|tution, there would follow the&s;e con&s;iderable ones in their Conduct: The Privateers being govern'd each within it &s;elf, and each of them ab&s;olutely independent of others, would act for the mo&s;t part &s;ingly; for acting in Concert can hardly an&s;wer their End, which is, to enrich them&s;elves; for they can &s;carce get &s;o many together as to be potent e|nough for a trading Fleet and its Convoy, and they could never find their Account while they were altogether imploy'd in taking of &s;ingle Ships: But while they act &s;ingly, or by two or three in a company, the foremention'd Ve&s;&s;els would act in concert, always within call one of another, as having their General and Subaltern Officers like a Royal Navy; for which rea&s;on the Privateers would &s;eldom or never have any Advantage over them, and they would never attack them without
<PB N="25" REF="28">
&s;uch an Advantage, becau&s;e Gain being their only Incitement, they would hardly be induced to fight when there was a great deal more danger of lo&s;ing their own Ships, than of taking their Enemies; whereas our Ships acting in concert, and upon oc|ca&s;ion in con&s;iderable numbers, would very often have the advantage of the Privateers; and when they had not, would be oblig'd by honour to at|tack them on the &s;quare; and whereas they who did &s;o, would have both Ambition and Intere&s;t to &s;u&s;tain them, the others would have only mere pri|vate Intere&s;t. 'Tis true indeed, the number of Privateers may be &s;omething augmented by the D. of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI>; but it will not be much, becau&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have nei|ther much Mony, nor many Seamen to &s;pare: And if &s;ometimes our Cruizers alone, during the time of the late War, made &s;uch terrible work with the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, and would have made more if they had not been too nimble and too light for them; What mu&s;t not &s;o con&s;iderable, and &s;o well proportion'd a Force do, back'd by tho&s;e very Cruizers? How would tho&s;e Privateers get out of <HI>St. Malo,</HI> or <HI>Dunkirk?</HI> or how would they get in again with their Plunder, when tho&s;e Ports &s;hould be block'd up by our fore&s;aid Ve&s;&s;els, &s;u&s;tain'd by our Fourth-rate Cruizers? Or would they not be afraid to venture when the Hazard is &s;o great, and the Gain &s;o uncertain? and when in open Sea, it would be difficult for them to di&s;tingui&s;h our trad|ing Ships from the very Ve&s;&s;els that would lie in wait for their Ruin. But if it &s;hould be urg'd that the <HI>French</HI> King in a very little time would be
<PB N="26" REF="29">
for u&s;ing the &s;ame Method, and &s;end out his Priva|teers on his own account, back'd by &s;ome of his Men of War, in Numbers and Strength &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t ours: To that we an&s;wer, that he can ne|ver find Seamen enough to &s;upply both his Navy and tho&s;e &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els; and that if he could, this Method would infallibly bring on a Sea-fight, which is the very thing that we chiefly ought to de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I come now to an&s;wer another Objection, which is, That the Mony &s;et apart for making the Lo&s;&s;es good, would be in&s;ufficient, and that con&s;equently this De&s;ign would bring the Nation more into debt. But by what has been &s;aid already, and by what &s;hall be now &s;aid, I doubt not of mak|ing it appear, that it would be an infallible Means for the keeping the Nation out of Debt. For, fir&s;t, we have &s;hewn in the preceding Paragraph, that the <HI>French</HI> would not be likely to take many of our Ships, and con&s;equently this Method by &s;aving the Ships, would pre&s;erve the Cu&s;toms, and &s;o prove a con&s;iderable Support to one of the greate&s;t Branches of the Publick Revenue. But, &s;econdly, &s;ince this Method will hinder them from taking our Ships; we mu&s;t take theirs if they &s;tir, and con&s;equently there would be more Mony coming to the Queen, as well as to the Seamen to encourage them: Be&s;ides, that &s;everal of the Ships which we take from them might be imploy'd in the room of as many of the hir'd ones, and &s;o le&s;|&s;en the Charge of the Undertaking. But if on the other &s;ide their Ships &s;hould not &s;tir out, we
<PB N="27" REF="30">
&s;hould do our Bu&s;ine&s;s without taking them, for they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Commerce. Third|ly, The Mony coming in daily at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es for In&s;urance, may &s;ave the Government the borrowing of &s;everal Sums, and con&s;equently &s;ave the Nation a great deal in extravagant Inte|re&s;t. Fourthly, The Mony that may be paid for Importations at the Out-ports, and particularly at <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> may &s;ave the Queen a great deal of Charge, as well as Trouble and Time in Remittances thither. Fifthly, The pro&s;ecution of this Method will capacitate us the &s;ooner to make an end of the War, and con&s;equently ena|ble us the &s;ooner to get out of Debt, and &s;o may &s;ave us va&s;t Sums in Intere&s;t and in Principal.</P>
<P>There remains yet one more Objection, and that is, That this would be a needle&s;s Preparation, be|cau&s;e our Privateers encourag'd, would an&s;wer all the Ends of it. To which I reply, That, fir&s;t, the whole Number of Privateers would not amount to half the Force. Secondly, That that Number which &s;hould be equipp'd of them, would not act in concert. Thirdly, That in Privateers the Seamen would not have half the Incouragement that they will have in this Subordinate Fleet: For we &s;up|po&s;e, that be&s;ides the ordinary Premiums upon Guns, &s;uch a Proportion of the Prizes as &s;hall be thought convenient, &s;hall &s;till be allow'd to the Officers and the Seamen. Fourthly, Our ordina|ry Privateers would rarely attack tho&s;e of the E|nemy. Fifthly, The Gain to the Publick from Privateers would not be &s;o much by a Tenth Part.
<PB N="28" REF="31">
Sixthly, It would be a hard matter to encourage Privateers, without burdening the Publick, be|cau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> are a People of &s;mall Traffick, and others for the mo&s;t part carry out their Goods for them.</P>
<P>Thus I have laid down the Method which came into my Thoughts for the &s;ecuring of Commerce, and which the Sen&s;e of the Duty that I owe my Country, oblig'd me to propo&s;e to the Great A&s;&s;embly which is cho&s;en to repre&s;ent it at this im|portant Juncture. Whether the Method that I have propos'd be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the End, I leave to be determin'd by that Illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly. If it appears to be effectual, I make no doubt but it will be follow'd; for then, tho we may be victorious without it, yet we may not: but the &s;ecuring our Commerce will &s;ecure our Victory; and the Repre&s;entatives of a Great and a Wi&s;e People will, if they can help it, leave nothing to Fortune. If we can &s;ecure our Commerce, we mu&s;t remain a free Independent People; if we cannot, we may become a conquer'd Province.</P>
