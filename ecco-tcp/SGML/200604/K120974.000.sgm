<HEAD>TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a Time, when all Communities Congratulate Your MAJESTY on the <HI>Glories</HI> of Your Reign, which are continually ri&s;ing from the <HI>Pro&s;perities</HI> of Your People; be graciou&s;ly pleas'd, <HI>Dread Sir,</HI> to permit the lowe&s;t of Your Subjects from the <HI>Theatre,</HI> to take this Occa&s;ion of offering their mo&s;t Humble Acknowledgments for Your Royal Favour and Protection.</P>
<P>YOUR Comedians, SIR, are an Unhappy Society, whom &s;ome Severe Heads think wholly U&s;ele&s;s, and o|thers Dangerous to the Young and Innocent: This Come|dy is therefore an Attempt to remove that Prejudice, and to &s;hew, what Hone&s;t and Laudable U&s;es may be made of the <HI>Theatre,</HI> when its Performaces keep clo&s;e to the true Purpo&s;es of its In&s;titution: That it may be nece&s;&s;ary to divert the Sullen and Di&s;&s;affected from bu&s;ying their Brains to di&s;turb the Happine&s;s of a Government, which (for want of proper Amu&s;ements) they often enter into Wild and Seditious Schemes to reform: And that it may likewi&s;e make tho&s;e very Follies the Ridicule and Diver|&s;ion even of tho&s;e that committed them. Our Labours have at lea&s;t this Glory to boa&s;t, That &s;ince Plays were fir&s;t Exhibited in <HI>England,</HI> they were never totally &s;up|pre&s;s'd, but by tho&s;e very People, that turn'd our <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> into <HI>Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Anarchy.</HI></P>
<P>OF all Errors, tho&s;e that are the Effect of <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> make us naturally mo&s;t ob&s;tinate; it is therefore no won|der, that the Blinded Pro&s;elytes of our Few Non-Juring Clergy, are &s;o hard to be recover'd by the cleare&s;t Evi|dences of Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on. But when a <HI>Principle</HI> is once made truly <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> it is not in the Power of Human Nature not to be <HI>a&s;ham'd</HI> of it. From which Reflection, I was fir&s;t determin'd to attack tho&s;e <HI>lurking</HI> Enemies of our Con&s;titution from the Stage: And though my Succe&s;s has far exceeded my Expectation, yet I grieve, when I (perhaps with Vanity) imagine it might had thrice the
<PB REF="4">
good Effect on the Minds of Your MAJESTY'S People, were it not under the <HI>Misfortune</HI> of being written by a <HI>Comedian.</HI> I am therefore in &s;ome Terror, notwith&s;tanding its Publick Applau&s;e, to reflect how far Your MAJESTY, in Your Wi&s;dom, may think it proper to with-hold Your Pardon for the Unlicen&s;ed Boldne&s;s of my Undertaking. I am &s;en&s;ible it may be ju&s;tly urg'd again&s;t me, That e|ven <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Loyalty</HI> might have lo&s;t their Lu&s;tre, by ap|pearing reduc'd to want the Defence of &s;o incon&s;idera|ble a Champion: But as I never believ'd the be&s;t Play could be &s;upported in an Ill Cau&s;e; &s;o was I a&s;&s;ur'd the wor&s;t might pa&s;s, with Favour, in a Good one. And though my Duty and Concern has made me more careful in the Conduct of this, than any of my former Endea|vours; I am convinc'd, that what may have been extra|ordinary in the Succe&s;s of it, is utterly owing to a happy Choice of the Subject: And as its meeting no Oppo&s;ition from our Publick Malecontents, &s;eems, in &s;ome Degree, an Argument of the Clear and Hone&s;t Truth of tho&s;e Principles it vindicates; &s;o may it of the equal Fal&s;hood of the Rebellious and Unchri&s;tian Tenets it expo&s;es. Nay, I have yet a farther Hope, that it has even di&s;co|vered the Strength and Number of the <HI>Mi&s;guided</HI> to be much le&s;s, than may have been artfully infinuated; there being no A&s;&s;embly where People are &s;o free, and apt to &s;peak their Minds, as in a Crowded <HI>Theatre;</HI> Of which Your MAJESTY may have lately &s;een an In&s;tance, in the In&s;uppre&s;&s;ible Acclamations that were given on Your appearing to Honour this Play with Your Royal Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>BUT were the Di&s;affected yet as Numerous, as &s;ome Few may wi&s;h them, What Hone&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can ever think them formidable, that con&s;iders his Security in the Wi&s;dom of Your MAJESTY'S <HI>Coun&s;els,</HI> and Your He|roick <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> to Execute them? And as every Action of Your Regal Power has &s;hewn the Nation, that Your greate&s;t <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Delight</HI> is in being the <HI>Father</HI> of Your <HI>People;</HI> &s;o may it Convince its Enemies, that <HI>they</HI> will always find You KING of Your <HI>Subjects.</HI>&mdash;But I am wandring into Thoughts that awe me into Silence; and humbly beg Leave to Sub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>
<CLOSER>May it plea&s;e Your <HI>MAJESTY,</HI> <SIGNED>Your <HI>MAJESTY'S</HI> Mo&s;t Dutiful, and Mo&s;t Obedient, Subject and Servant, COLLEY CIBBER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>With Submi&s;&s;ion, Sir, I don't take that to be the Ca&s;e. Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI>'s Birth and Fortune are too well known to you; and I dare &s;wear he may de&s;y the World, to lay a Blemi&s;h upon his Principles.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir, you may give your &s;elf what Air of Amazement you plea&s;e,&mdash;I won't argue with you; you are both of you too harden'd to be converted now, but &s;ince you thing it your Duty, as a Son, to be con|cern'd for my Errors, I think it as much mine, as a Fa|ther, to be concern'd for yours&mdash;I'll only tell you of them, if you think fit to mend them&mdash;&s;o&mdash;if not&mdash;take the Con&s;equence.</P>

<P>That's a very unu&s;ual Mixture, Sir; but if a Man entertains me innocently, am I oblig'd to enquire into his Profe&s;&s;ion, or Principles?

At this he took new Life, and &s;pringing from his Hold, fell prote&s;tate at his Feet; where mute, and trembling, for a while he lay: At length with &s;treaming Eyes, and faultring Tongue, he begg'd his Ble&s;&s;ing, and his Pardon. The tender Father caught him in his Arms, and dropping his fond Head upon his Cheek, ki&s;s'd him, and &s;igh'd out, <HI>Heaven protect thee!</HI> then gave into his hand the Royal Pardon; and turning back his Face to dry his Manly Eyes, he cry'd, <HI>De&s;erve this Royal Mercy,</HI> Charles, <HI>and I am &s;till thy Father.</HI> The grateful Youth. rai&s;ing his Heart-&s;wollen Voice, reply'd, <HI>May Heaven pre&s;erve the Royal Life that gave it.</HI> But here, their Pa&s;&s;ions grew too &s;trong for farther Speech: Silent Embraces, alter|nate Sighs, and mingling Tears, were all their Language now.

<P>For thee my Son, who&s;e filial Virtues I have Injur'd; this Hone&s;t Deed in every Article &s;hall be ratified: I &s;ee your Eyes are all upon me, expecting from that vile Traytors Parctices, &s;ome Voluntary In&s;tance of my Hearts Conver|&s;ion: I mu&s;t be Blind indeed, were I not now convinc'd He mu&s;t in all things have alike deceiv'd me, as the Di|al that mi&s;s-tels one Hour, of Con&s;equence is fal&s;e through the whole round of Day.

<L>HOW Wild, how Frantick is the vain E&s;&s;ay,</L>
<L>That Builds on Modern Politicks a Play!</L>
<L>Methinks to Write at all, is Bold enough,</L>
<L>But in a Play to &s;tand a Faction Buff!</L>
<L>Not <HI>Rome</HI>'s Old Stage pre&s;um'd, (or Fame's a Fibber.)</L>
<L>And Moderns to attempt it! well &s;aid <HI>CIBBER!</HI></L>
<L>Was't not enough the Criticks might pur&s;ue him!</L>
<L>But mu&s;t he rou&s;e a Party to undo him!</L>
<L>The&s;e Blows I told him on his Play would fall,</L>
<L>But he unmov'd, cry'd&mdash;Blood! we'll Stand it all,</L>
<L>When PRIESTS turn TRAYTORS where's the mighty matter?</L>
<L>Since when has Trea&s;on been exempt from Satyr?</L>
<L>And &s;hould from Guilt a Factious Clamour Ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Such Spite mu&s;t &s;peak them <HI>England's</HI> Enemies,</L>
<L>But if <HI>Old England's</HI> Friends allow 'tis right,</L>
<L>W'are &s;ure their Power can chace the Jacobite,</L>
<L>And put their Malice, like their Troops, to Flight.</L>
<L>As for the Criticks, Tho&s;e, he owns, may Teize him,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e he never took &s;uch Pains to plea&s;e them,</L>
<L>In Time; Place, Action, Rules by which Old Wits</L>
<L>Made Plays, as&mdash;Dames do Puddings, by Receipts:</L>
<L>But hopes again ev'n Rebels cannot &s;ay,</L>
<L>Tho' Vanqui&s;ht, they're In&s;ulted in his Play:</L>
<L>Nay more&mdash;To &s;et their Cau&s;e in faire&s;t light,</L>
<L>H' has made a Man of Sen&s;e&mdash;A Jacobite!</L>
<L>(Tho' by our Bards good leave, (to take it right,</L>
<L>His Sen&s;e was &s;hewn, when turn'd from Jacobite)</L>
<L>Thus too the Fair, that may be wrong Inclin'd,</L>
<L>He Hopes to <HI>CHARLES's</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion will be Kind,</L>
<L>And own, at wor&s;t, on their Reflecting Pillow,</L>
<L>The Rebel, after all's, a Pretty Fellow!</L>
<L>But why, you'll &s;ay, was I made <HI>HEARTLYS</HI> Wife?</L>
<L>Con&s;ider, Fair ones, <HI>HEARTLY</HI> &s;av'd his Life:</L>
<L>So that you &s;ee, the Boy han't quite Mi&s;carried</L>
<L>Be&s;ide&mdash;</L>
<L>Are all tho&s;e Dears &s;o Happy you have Married?</L>
<L>How often, in that State, has Love &s;een Elves</L>
<L>So Cramm'd with Com&s;ort, they could Han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves?</L>
<L>The Wor&s;t you can again&s;t his Satyr Plead,</L>
<L>Is that My Lord of <HI>THETFORD's</HI> Hang'd indeed:</L>
<L>If that &s;eems hard&punc; why Grant him your Reprive,</L>
<L>And by an Act of Grace, let this <HI>NON-JUROR</HI> Live.</L>
