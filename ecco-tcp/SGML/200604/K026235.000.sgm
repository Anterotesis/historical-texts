<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Public Affairs
calls forcibly upon every good Subject,
to exert him&s;elf in the Public Service. Every
individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power, which can aid and
&s;upport his country. He can draw his &s;word in
her defence, contribute to her re&s;ources, or
combat with argument, and expo&s;e to ju&s;t in|dignation,
tho&s;e, who have proved them&s;elves
her internal, and con&s;equently, her unnatural
enemies.</P>
<P>The Author of the following E&s;&s;ay has long
entertained an opinion, that the mo&s;t formi|dable
foes of Great Britain were nur&s;ed in her
own bo&s;om: The&s;e, under the ma&s;que of Patri|oti&s;m,
fomented rebellion in her Colonies; and
by expo&s;ing her pretended weakne&s;s, created a
combination of powerful States, not only again&s;t
her intere&s;t, but her very exi&s;tence, as a great
and independent Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the emergency, which is the re&s;ult of that
combination, two objects &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Public Safety. The&s;e are, the knowledge of
our friends from our enemies; and that &s;pirited
exertion, which alone can extricate us, from our
pre&s;ent &s;ituation. If the facts advanced, and
encouragements exhibited, in the following E&s;|&s;ay,
&s;hall contribute to throw light, on the one;
or to add vigour to the other, the Writer has
attained his purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT
HISTORY
OF THE
OPPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>IN every age, and almo&s;t in every country,
the ambition, which is inherent in human na|ture,
has prompted individuals to a&s;pire to di&s;|tinction
and pre-eminence, among their fellow|citizens.
The means, u&s;ed to obtain tho&s;e ob|jects,
are various; as to render them &s;ucce&s;s|ful
they mu&s;t be accommodated to the &s;pirit
of the government, under which they are ap|plied.
In de&s;potic monarchies, the favour of
the Prince, who is the fountain of all prefer|ment,
is generally procured by intrigue or ad|dre&s;s.
In republics, influence and authority
are acquired, by gaining the confidence, or by
&s;educing the principles of the people; and, in
mixed governments, like that of Great Britain,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
the neare&s;t road to power lies between tho&s;e two
extremes.</P>
<P>The Revolution, which happened about
ninety years ago, though it made but few
changes in the forms of authority, e&s;tabli&s;hed a
balance of influence, between the Crown and the
People. The fir&s;t retained the e&s;&s;ence, but lo&s;t
much of the terror of power. The repre&s;enta|tives
of the latter having a great deal to be&s;tow,
as a body, thought them&s;elves, as individuals,
entitled to a &s;hare in a government, which they
&s;upported. A mutual dependence was created,
by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means of conferring mu|tual
favours. A Prince, who &s;tood in need of
&s;upplies, was directed, by common prudence,
where to chu&s;e his &s;ervants. But as candidates
were more numerous than offices, the di&s;ap|pointed
never failed to per&s;ecute the &s;ucce&s;sful,
till, by watching faults, errors, or misfortunes,
they obtained their point, and they them|&s;elves
became, in their turn, the objects of
attack.</P>
<P>As a degree of the public confidence was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to direct the Sovereign in his choice of
&s;ervants, men who wi&s;hed to be employed, took
care to &s;upport, in their public appearances,
the principles and perhaps the prejudices of
the people. An habitual jealou&s;y of the power
<PB N="3" REF="6">
of the Crown, kept open the ears of the public
to every alarm. Scarce any mea&s;ure of Go|vernment
could be &s;o free from error, as not
to be vulnerable on &s;ome popular ground.
Every Oppo&s;ition &s;eized this obvious advan|tage,
and a&s;&s;umed or obtained the title of "the
popular party." No di&s;tinction was made,
in this re&s;pect, between <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> Each
party, when out of place, adopted the &s;ame
principles; and thus both were alternately
dignified with the once honourable name of
PATRIOTS.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent reign began, with advantages,
calculated to put an end to fooli&s;h di&s;tinctions,
which ought to have expired, with the preju|dices,
on which they had been founded. A
young prince had &s;ucceeded to the throne, who
di&s;dained to govern his people through the me|dium
of a faction. The door of preferment
was laid open to all his &s;ubjects; but though
this liberal conduct might have plea&s;ed the un|prejudiced,
it was incapable of extingui&s;hing
party among the intere&s;ted. The&s;e, though of
different principles and characters, by impo&s;ing
on the weak and credulous, formed new factions,
on the &s;hadows of departed political tenets.
However heterogeneous before, the heat of re|&s;entment,
and rage of di&s;appointment, as it
were, gradually melted them into one ma&s;s;
<PB N="4" REF="7">
and they revived in them&s;elves the name, though
little of the principles of WHIGS.</P>
<P>The vehemence of the pre&s;ent Oppo&s;ition
&s;eems to have carried them to extremities,
which &s;uper&s;ede all former de&s;criptions of party,
and which cannot fail to defeat their views. In
former times, the candidates for public favour
thought it prudent to adhere, in their exhibi|tions,
to public principles. But in our times,
an eagerne&s;s to thwart the mea&s;ures of Govern|ment
has expelled all regard for the opinions of
the people. The dignity and honour of the
nation were formerly the favourite themes of Op|po&s;itions;
melancholy, meanne&s;s, and de&s;pair,
now fill the whole circle of patriotic oratory.
With a want of prudence, as well as of decency,
they tie up the hands of their country in the
hour of danger. They not only ju&s;tify rebel|lion,
again&s;t her authority, but indirectly pro|mote
a foreign war again&s;t her very exi&s;tence:
By magnifying the power of her opponents,
they endeavour to depre&s;s her &s;pirits; by ex|po&s;ing
her real or pretended weakne&s;s, they
wi&s;h to in&s;pire her enemies with a confidence of
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trange po&s;itions, and many more of
the &s;ame kind, might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, on incon|te&s;tible
authorities, by a plain narrative of the
<PB N="5" REF="8">
conduct of oppo&s;ition, &s;ince the commencement
of the pre&s;ent parliament. But, the pur&s;u|ing
them through &s;uch a variety of matter,
and &s;uch a length of time, would be a ta&s;k
of great labour, and little entertainment. We
&s;hall, therefore, confine our&s;elves to the mo&s;t
&s;triking features of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. In the
&s;pace of &s;even months, they have contrived to
croud together mo&s;t of the ab&s;urdities of &s;even
years; and, though the &s;tudied brevity of this
di&s;qui&s;ition mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exclude many cir|cum&s;tances,
enough, we tru&s;t, will appear to
&s;hew the principles, de&s;igns, and views of &s;o
&s;trange a confederacy.</P>
<P>On the 26th of November, 1778, the fifth
&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent parliament was opened,
with a &s;peech from the throne. A complaint
of the perfidy of France, in commencing ho&s;ti|lities,
and the ob&s;tinacy of America, in refu&s;ing
terms, together with a reque&s;t of &s;upport, were
the chief heads of the &s;peech. It expre&s;&s;ed, at
the &s;ame time, a regret "that the efforts of
his Maje&s;ty had not been attended with all
the &s;ucce&s;s which the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, and
the vigour of exertions, &s;eemed to promi&s;e."
Unanimity was, in the u&s;ual form, recommend|ed;
and &s;urely no period in hi&s;tory more re|quired
the unanimous exertion of the whole
nation.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
Oppo&s;ition have denominated them&s;elves
"an active Oppo&s;ition;" and if zeal in thwart|ing,
a&s;&s;iduity in ob&s;tructing, and &s;ucce&s;s in de|feating
public mea&s;ures, merit a de&s;ignation,
which implies a kind of applau&s;e, they are
certainly entitled to that name. The una|nimity
and concert, which their Sovereign
reque&s;ted, for the &s;upport of the intere&s;ts
and honour of the nation, exi&s;t only among
them, for the ruin of the one, and the tarni&s;h|ing
of the other. A &s;hort detail of the prin|ciples,
which they advanced in the fir&s;t exhibi|tions
of the &s;ea&s;on, will e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of
this ob&s;ervation. The orators in the Lower
Hou&s;e mixed reflections on the pa&s;t, with pro|phecies
of future di&s;a&s;ters. The fir&s;t we &s;hall
&s;ubmit to the judgment of the Reader; &s;eve|ral
of the latter have been already refuted by
time.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition opened the political campaign,
with a&s;&s;ertions, which had been often refuted;
and with predictions of national di&s;a&s;ters, which
their own conduct &s;eemed, uniformly, calculated
to realize. As the public misfortunes may be
deduced, from the rebellion in America, they
a&s;&s;erted, contrary to fact, that ho&s;tilities had
been fir&s;t commenced by government. They
recurred to their u&s;ual prophecies, relative to
foreign wars; and they even went &s;o far as to arm
Holland, our ancient ally, again&s;t this devoted

With a contradiction in terms, which nei|ther
folly nor rage it&s;elf could ju&s;tify, they aver|red
that Mini&s;try had &s;ucceeded in <HI>no in&s;tance</HI>;
yet that fortune had been favourable in <HI>every in|&s;tance,</HI>
during the whole campaign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. They

<P>Though the clogging the wheels of Govern|ment
at home, and their encouraging the &s;edi|tious
abroad, had been the obvious cau&s;e of the
ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the American war, they
traced the cau&s;e of the war to the pretended ty|ranny
of Great-Britain<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Though America had
continued an atrocious rebellion for many years,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
again&s;t her parent and benefactre&s;s; yet they
affirmed, that a war again&s;t America "is
again&s;t our own country." Though the
Americans have been declared <HI>rebels,</HI> by all the
&s;olemnity of law, by all the forms of the con|&s;titution,

out as proper for this country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>," war ought
not "to be offen&s;ive with re&s;pect to America."
With unexampled ab&s;urdity, they alleged,
that rebels in arms had a better right to "a
relaxation of ho&s;tilities," than foreign ene|mies,
whom the alliance of tho&s;e rebels had
excited again&s;t their country. With a perver|&s;ion
of terms, unknown, in any other times,
they a&s;&s;erted, that men, who&s;e hands are daily
&s;tained with the blood of their countrymen,

<P>A&s;&s;ertions, which carried along with them
their own refutation, were not likely to make
converts within, nor pro&s;elytes without doors.
But what the party could not effect by facts
and arguments, they endeavoured to accom|pli&s;h,
by addre&s;s and intrigue. Mi&s;manage|ments,
and a con&s;equent want of &s;ucee&s;s, on
every &s;ide of the war, had convinced the na|tion,
that there was an error in planning at
home, or a defect in the execution abroad.
Generals and Admirals had returned, from
their different commands, not only without
laurels, but &s;ome of them covered with di&s;grace
or misfortune. The coldne&s;s, with which they
had been received, by their country, had rai&s;ed
their re&s;entment, as it hurt their pride. As Go|vernment
brought forward no accu&s;ation again&s;t
them, the pre&s;umption was, that they them|&s;elves
were partly to blame. As men of little
prudence and con&s;iderable names, are the fitte&s;t
tools for the hands of party, Oppo&s;ition took
care to &s;ecure engines, which they hoped to
play off with advantage, on the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne, though a man &s;pirit, of
conducted him&s;elf, as if political prudence form|ed
no part of his character. His enemies re|marked,
that he came from America, where he
had lo&s;t an army, with as much confidence, as
Terentius Varro returned to Rome, from the fa|tal
fields of Cannae. Men, in general, have
le&s;s blamed his conduct abroad, than his beha|viour
at home. His accepting a leave of ab&s;ence
from a Congre&s;s, who had &s;hamefully evaded
hs own convention, the remembrance of recent
misfortunes, and a &s;u&s;picion of former errors,
ju&s;tified the court, in adhering to an <HI>etiquette,</HI>
which excludes officers, who have been unfor|tunate,
from the Royal Pre&s;ence, till they are
acquitted by a Court Martial.</P>
<P>The General forgot his own errors, if &s;uch
exi&s;ted, and remembered only, what he thought,
the &s;everity of Government. He al&s;o forgot,
that he had left his captive fellow-&s;oldiers,
whom he ought to have protected from in&s;ult
and oppre&s;&s;ion, by his pre&s;ence; and he even,
eluded orders given him to return to their aid,
in their melancholy and &s;evere captivity. It was
ob&s;erved, upon the whole, that regret and pity
were all he could hope to meet with; but,
it &s;eems, he expected approbation. Re&s;ent|ment
aro&s;e, in his mind, as from inju&s;tice;
<PB N="12" REF="15">
and with a precipitancy, which cannot ea&s;ily be
defended, he either &s;ought or accepted the pro|tection
of Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Sir W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e had, indeed, lo&s;t no army,
but as he had deci&s;ively improved no advantage,
the American war rather increa&s;ed, than dimi|ni&s;hed,
upon his hands. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the com|mon
<HI>routine</HI> of military knowledge, he &s;eems to
have been capable of &s;ecuring from defeat <HI>&s;uch</HI>
troops as <HI>be</HI> led again&s;t <HI>&s;uch</HI> an enemy: But
the conducting them to any brilliant victory,
and the making a deci&s;ive u&s;e of the &s;upe|riority
he enjoyed, appear to have been ob|jects
foreign to his talents. Sen&s;ible, per|haps,
of this defect, in his own mind, he cho&s;e
to prevent any reverie of fortune by retiring
from the command of the army; but as "mi|litary
&s;ece&s;&s;ions," in the mid&s;t of war, require
an explanation, his retreat was a&s;cribed to his
having lo&s;t the confidence of men in power.
The fact might be true, but it was not &s;ufficient,
to &s;atisfy the people. Though he was received
with kindne&s;s by the Sovereign, and attention
by the Mini&s;try, he perceived that he was va|ni&s;hing
fa&s;t from the memory of the nation.
In the &s;pace of a few months, he found him|&s;elf
of as little account, in the e&s;timation
of the Public, as any of his own commi&s;&s;aries;
<PB N="13" REF="16">
and, to recover his reputation, he clo&s;ed ea|gerly,
with Oppo&s;ition; as they promi&s;ed him
their hearty a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in a Parliamentary In|quiry.</P>
<P>To the&s;e lucky aids from America, the party
added a &s;till greater acqui&s;ition in Europe. An
Admiral po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of profe&s;&s;ional reputation,
equal at lea&s;t to his merit, though connected
with Oppo&s;ition, was placed at the head of the
We&s;tern Squadron. The &s;electing men of <HI>op|po&s;ing</HI>
principles, for the command of fleets and
armies, has been long a favourite maxim of
Government. This conduct may have had its
foundation in liberal &s;entiments; but it has ope|rated
like weakne&s;s, and led to a train of mi&s;|fortunes.
Few officers are &s;uch "&s;turdy mora|li&s;ts,"
as to exclude political prejudices from
the line of their duty.</P>
<P>Our Admiral put to &s;ea, with one of the
mo&s;t powerful &s;quadrons, that ever &s;ailed, from
the ports of this kingdom. He met the ene|my;
and a running fight, rather than an en|gagement,
en&s;ued. No trophies were lo&s;t; but
no laurels were gained. The profe&s;&s;ional terms,
in which the accounts of naval actions are in|volved,
render them ob&s;cure, if not unintel|ligible,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
to the generality of mankind. One
fact, however, was univer&s;ally admitted: "A
&s;uperior Briti&s;h fleet had engaged an inferior
French &s;quadron; and neither advantage nor
trophy was obtained."</P>
<P>A nation, accu&s;tomed to value them&s;elves
upon naval victories, were not likely to be &s;a|tisfied
with a drawn battle, under &s;uch circum|&s;tances.
But though no &s;ymptoms of approba|tion
appeared, no &s;igns of re&s;entment were
&s;hown. A cold &s;ilence certainly prevailed; a
&s;pecies of cen&s;ure, more mortifying to a feeling
mind, than even clamour. Had the Admiral
been permitted to remain, under this cloud, he
would have become a u&s;ele&s;s engine, in the
hands of his party. To derive benefit from his
former popularity, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to
remove the &s;tain, which want of &s;ucce&s;s had left
upon his character. Some officers, in his &s;uite,
were, accordingly, induced to propagate in&s;i|nuations,
to the di&s;advantage of Vice-Admiral
Sir H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r. That gentleman, by be|ing
in place, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to act in
concert with men in power, for the ruin of his
Admiral; and to make the former the <HI>accu&s;er</HI>
was to arm the prejudices of the people in fa|vour
of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
The Vice Admiral being a man of more &s;pirit
than fore&s;ight, unfortunately fell into the trap
laid for him by the faction. Con&s;cious of his
de&s;erving prai&s;e, in&s;tead of cen&s;ure, for his be|haviour
on the 27th of July, he became irri|tated
at the inju&s;tice done to his reputation.
From being the <HI>accu&s;ed,</HI> he became the <HI>accu&s;er</HI>;
and this &s;tep turned the &s;cale of opinion in fa|vour
of his opponent. In this circum&s;tance
alone the gallant Vice-Admiral, as it after|wards
appeared, was to blame. Had he de|manded
and in&s;i&s;ted upon his own trial, his
character would have recovered its de&s;erved
lu&s;tre; and that of the Admiral might have lo&s;t
much of that &s;plendour which was thrown upon
it, by his indu&s;trious friends.</P>
<P>A party, who had lo&s;t the confidence of the
nation, &s;eized with eagerne&s;s the &s;udden change
which appeared in the popular tide. Whi&s;pers
artfully propagated, without doors, were im|proved
by degrees into a general clamour.
Within doors, every opportunity was taken, and
every artifice u&s;ed to feed the ri&s;ing flame. The
two Admirals, if a vulgar expre&s;&s;ion may be
u&s;ed, were <HI>pitted</HI> again&s;t each other. Much
&s;port, or what is the &s;ame thing to Oppo&s;ition,
much mi&s;chief, was expected from this conte&s;t.
A man of popularity was accu&s;ed, by a man
<PB N="16" REF="19">
in office. The common changes of mini|&s;terial
interference were rung, without cea&s;|ing,
in the ears of the people. The helple&s;s
condition of INNOCENCE, when per&s;ecuted by
POWER, was echoed, from every corner, by
the runners, writers, and abettors of Oppo&s;i|tion.
The two hou&s;es of Parliament re&s;ounded
with vehement declamations, or broken accents
of whining oratory; and that amiable but much
abu&s;ed virtue, pity, was excited, every where,
in the brea&s;ts of the deluded, the credulous and
the weak.</P>
<P>In vain had Sir H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r declared, in
the mo&s;t &s;olemn and public manner, that he
had not communicated his de&s;ign to any man in

the faith of Gentlemen, that they knew nothing
of the accu&s;ation, till it was officially delivered
to the Admiralty. No credit was to be given to
any member of a <HI>Tory</HI> Admini&s;tration. They
were leagued together in one plan of oppre&s;&s;ion,
in one dark de&s;ign, in one pre-concerted con&s;pi|racy,
to ruin the reputation, and even to take
the life, of a <HI>Whig</HI> Admiral.</P>

Their abrogating the old forms of the Admi|ralty,

their appearance at Port&s;mouth, upon the occa|&s;ion,
their bia&s;&s;ing witne&s;&s;es, their carrying all

&s;uch mean, &s;candalous, and unju&s;tifiable tricks
of faction, as can &s;carcely be paralleled by any
example in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The pitiful victory which they obtained over
an unfortunate, becau&s;e a vehement, man, was
pur&s;ued with an intemperance inexcu&s;able even
in boys, and with a rancour which the mo&s;t pro|fligate
and hard-hearted men, if prudent, would
have concealed, to pre&s;erve, at lea&s;t, the ap|pearance
of decency. That men of the fir&s;t fa|milies,
in this country, &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e them|&s;elves
like porters to force illuminations by
breaking windows, is a circum&s;tance which
throws an indelible &s;tain upon the times, as
well as on the party. It even appeared, that,
with every inclination to commit mi&s;chief, the
riotous demagogues were obliged to have re|cour&s;e
to the bottle, for that courage which na|ture
<PB N="19" REF="22">
had denied. That in the hour of "intoxi|cation
and ad&s;cititious boldne&s;s," they attack|ed
the feeble and old among the men, and
terrified into fits and mi&s;carriages &s;everal wo|men,
by the rude barbarity of their behaviour.
That, however, as a ju&s;t retribution for their
wanton cruelties, many of them &s;uffered under
the hands and cudgels of the injured; and that
&s;everal were carried into Roundhou&s;es, covered
with ignominious marks of the cha&s;ti&s;ement they
had received.</P>
<P>Few men of &s;en&s;e, who were not connected
with the views, or privy to the de&s;igns of the
party, could perceive any ju&s;t grounds for this
&s;pecies of vulgar ovation. Though the <HI>accu&s;er</HI>
had not brought his charges to the &s;tandard of
legal proof, the <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> had not exculpated him|&s;elf
to the &s;atisfaction of the public. Tho&s;e who
were mo&s;t willing to deny his want of conduct,
regretted his want of good fortune; and a ge|neral
cry went forth, that an opportunity was
lo&s;t, which might never return again.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Admiral him&s;elf, on the
occa&s;ion, was not calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h any
high idea of his good &s;en&s;e or of his principles.
If he thought that he merited a triumph for the
drawn battle of the 27th of July, 1778, what
<PB N="20" REF="23">
are we to think of his under&s;tanding? If, on
the other hand, he made him&s;elf the tool of a
faction, what judgment mu&s;t we form of that
"dignified honour" which his friends annex to
his character? A victory, which had lain con|cealed
for &s;even months, and was, at length,
di&s;covered by accident, was not, intrin&s;ically,
worth the expence of many candles; and the
applau&s;e of a mob is the coar&s;e&s;t commodity
either a gentleman or his friends can purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Faction, as well as their naval friend,
acted as if they really gave credit to their own
a&s;&s;ertions and a&s;&s;umptions. Whil&s;t HE paraded
the &s;treets amid&s;t the fooli&s;h, if not hired, ac|clamations
of a rabble, THEY were bu&s;y in

they had &s;ufficiently charged the engine with
popularity, they re&s;olved to bring it to bear,
not only upon Admini&s;tration, but upon their
Sovereign. <HI>They</HI> propo&s;ed to make motions,

<P>In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, it was proved,
from official documents, that, in November
1777, there were actually thirty-five &s;hips of the

March 1778, &s;ome more &s;hips were in a &s;tate of

to forty-four. That when Mr. K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l was

actually was a greater number of &s;hips in Bre&s;t,
it was well known to &s;eamen, that an inferior

<P>Such were the a&s;&s;ertions, which Oppo&s;ition,
mixed with much abu&s;e and altercation, re|peatedly
echoed, from &s;ide to &s;ide, in both
Hou&s;es. Though the public, as well as Par|liament,
are frequently invited to an entertain|ment
of politics, by &s;ome very <HI>eloquent</HI> Patriots,
the di&s;h &s;erved up is always the &s;ame. To u&s;e
their own expre&s;&s;ion, "they have travelled &s;o
often over the ground," that they have trod
out every appearance of vegetation; and tho&s;e
who are &s;o idle as to accompany them in the
"dreary journey," can neither expect amu&s;e|ment,
nor reap advantage.</P>
<P>The operations of the party, <HI>without</HI> doors,
were more deci&s;ive than their arguments <HI>within.</HI>
Confident of &s;ucce&s;s, or a&s;&s;uming the appear|ance
of confidence, they had previou&s;ly gained
the votes of &s;everal provident members, who
<HI>wi&s;ely</HI> look into futurity. Lazy Whigs and
expecting patriots were roundly told, that to
&s;hare in the &s;poil it was nece&s;&s;ary to take an
active part in obtaining the victory. Mandates
were i&s;&s;ued for the immediate appearance of all
<PB N="24" REF="27">
ab&s;entees, from every corner of the kingdom.
The beds of the &s;ick, the couches of the gouty
and lame were vi&s;ited; leaders were &s;ent to the
blind. In &s;hort, patrioti&s;m crowded the lobbies
of both Hou&s;es, with all the mortifying pictures
of age, misfortune and di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To aid, with a &s;pecies of mutiny among &s;ea|men,
the attacks of Oppo&s;ition upon Admi|ralty,
the &s;eeds of &s;edition had been &s;own with a
lavi&s;h hand at Port&s;mouth. Officers had been
attacked through their ruling pa&s;&s;ions; the vain
with flattery, the weak with fallacious rea&s;on|ings,
and the avaricious and ambitious with
promi&s;es. To add indecency to pre&s;umption
and folly, the nation was <HI>threatened,</HI> with what
is vulgarly called a <HI>Round Robin,</HI> from every
&s;eaport. An Admiral, who had made &s;uch a
<HI>&s;plendid</HI> figure on the 27th of July, 1778,
dared to &s;ay to his &s;overeign, that he would
withdraw his talents from the &s;ervice, unle&s;s the
Admiralty, and every department of the State,
were placed in the hands of men whom he
could tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition drove, with &s;o much rapidity and
&s;o little judgment, that they overturned their
own de&s;igns. Their mean, and even criminal
conduct, offended the people; and the Sove|reign,
<PB N="25" REF="28">
with becoming dignity, rejected their
in&s;olent requi&s;itions. The current turned a|gain&s;t
them, and their &s;pirit vani&s;hed when their
hopes declined. The nation di&s;covered their
in&s;idious de&s;igns, their lu&s;t for power, their
thir&s;t for places. It was perceived that they
meant to &s;acrifice Great Britain, her rights, her
intere&s;ts, and even honour, to the demagogues
of America, by rendering her independent of
the parent from whom &s;he &s;prung. Even tho&s;e
who had been &s;educed by their a&s;&s;urances, or
gained by their promi&s;es, finding their mi&s;take,
began to retreat. The friends whom they had
brought from the country, by a &s;pecies of
<HI>habeas corpus,</HI> packed up their cloak-bags and
left the town. The beds of the &s;ick, and cou|ches
of the lame, were re-occupied; and even

by quitting her &s;ervice. The muddy &s;tream,

The hopes of the Faction had been rai&s;ed &s;o

Some, who either ignorantly or fondly imagi|ned
that the nation would take their part, be|gan
to talk of a &s;ece&s;&s;ion. A few orators are
&s;aid to have actually retired, to vent the tropes

K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l's acquittal, a new topic was &s;tarted,
which, as it promi&s;ed much mi&s;chief to their
country, opened a fre&s;h pro&s;pect of advantage
to the party. The trade of Ireland, and con&s;e|quently
its revenue, had been on the decline
for &s;ome years pa&s;t. The cau&s;es of that misfor|tune
are more difficult to a&s;certain than the
fact it&s;elf. Whether this diminution of com|merce
<PB N="27" REF="30">
proceeded from a decrea&s;e of the do|me&s;tic
indu&s;try, or a failure of foreign markets,
it equally demanded a remedy, if it could be
applied. Some &s;teps had been accordingly ta|ken,
toward that object, in the preceding
&s;e&s;&s;ion. But it appeared, at the time, that the
facility with which relief was granted, in&s;tead
of &s;atisfying Oppo&s;ition, was calculated to
create new demands. The&s;e demands, as they
interfered with the commerce of Great Britain,
were certain of being oppo&s;ed: a circum&s;tance,
which could not fail to create the <HI>de&s;irable</HI> con|fu&s;ion
which &s;uits the views of the party.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e, who really wi&s;hed to remove the
evil, it appeared that the Iri&s;h legi&s;lature ought
to be the be&s;t judges of the remedy. But nei|ther
that legi&s;lature, nor their con&s;tituents, had
&s;ignified any di&s;&s;atisfaction at the relief obtain|ed.
To convince both of the impropriety of
their <HI>peaceable</HI> conduct, Oppo&s;ition, by making
demands in the name of Ireland, pointed out
what &s;he might extort from Great Britain.
This artifice, they hoped, would reduce the
Mini&s;try to a di&s;agreeable dilemma. Should
they grant the demanded relief to the Iri&s;h,
they could not fail to offend the whole com|mercial
intere&s;t in great Britain: &s;hould they
refu&s;e it, there was a pro&s;pect, by proper ma|nagement,
<PB N="28" REF="31">
of creating tumults, and, perhaps,
of kindling a rebellion in Ireland.</P>
<P>Though this commercial adventure has not
yet been productive of all the profit expected
by the Faction, as the &s;hip is &s;till at &s;ea, the
cargo may turn out to &s;ome account. The in|ferior
Iri&s;h are, and have been in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
&s;ituation. The nature of the government, the
tenures of the country, a li&s;tle&s;s inactivity,
which always accompanies di&s;tre&s;s, a want of
indu&s;try, created by dome&s;tic di&s;couragements
of various kinds, have combined to render
their condition more wretched than that of
almo&s;t any other in Europe. They have long
felt their own mi&s;ery, without knowing well
from whence it came. Our worthy Patriots,
by pointing out Great Britain as the author
of Iri&s;h di&s;tre&s;s, may have &s;ome chance of rou|&s;ing
Iri&s;h re&s;entment. They have fomented
and encouraged re&s;i&s;tance in America, and
why may they not excite rebellion in Ireland?
The truth is, they &s;eem to have injured their
country beyond <HI>their</HI> degree of forgivene&s;s;
and if they cannot &s;atisfy their ambition by
her misfortunes, they are at lea&s;t re&s;olved to
gratify their re&s;entment by her ruin.</P>
<P>The attacks, in both Hou&s;es were &s;o &s;imi|lar,
in manner, a&s;&s;ertion, declamation, and in|vective,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
that it was apparent every mea&s;ure had
been weighed and pre-concerted in the cabinet
of &s;edition without doors. In this political war|fare,
the po&s;t of honour was given to the Pa|triots
of the Lower A&s;&s;embly, where the enemy
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t vulnerable. After the

<HI>above</HI>; where &s;ome noble orators wielded, with
peculiar dexterity, tho&s;e very weapons of &s;curri|lity
and invective, which had &s;o little availed the
cau&s;e in the hands of their more humble friends.</P>
<P>In the &s;lighte&s;t &s;kirmi&s;hes, with the common
enemy, the &s;ame co-operation, the &s;ame concert
appeared. Though compo&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;cordant
members, the whole party played in uni&s;on;
and every key, that was touched below, was
faithfully an&s;wered by a &s;imilar note from above.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;uch
a plentiful harve&s;t of confu&s;ion, that the whole
party employed their joint labour, in pre|paring
the &s;oil and &s;owing the feed. Indi|viduals
were not, in the mean time, idle, in

hopes, to the faction, from the expected i&s;&s;ue

though not publicly accu&s;ed, was &s;till anxious
to exculpate him&s;elf to the Public. Either
&s;wayed, by a good opinion of his own con|duct,
or tru&s;ting to the kind partiality of his
friends, he had flattered the Patriots and, per|haps,
him&s;elf, that he &s;hould be able to lay the
burden of American misfortunes, to the ac|count
of the mini&s;ter for the American de|partment.
The nation found it&s;elf di&s;ap|pointed,
but till matters were examined, it
was not known decidedly where cen&s;ure ought
to fall. An unwillingne&s;s in Government, to
admit of a Parliamentary Inquiry, on a military
&s;ubject, furni&s;hed their enemies with an oppor|tunity
of drawing conclu&s;ions, unfavourable
to Mini&s;try. The&s;e conclu&s;ions, in the u&s;ual
manner, became topics of patriotic invective
and declamation; which, in a manner, extort|ed
an inquiry, that had been once refu&s;ed, by
a vote.</P>
<P>But the re&s;ult of the Inquiry, was very different
from what Oppo&s;ition hoped. It appeared, that

furni&s;hed the rebels, with an opportunity

of blameable inactivity, in the General.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;trength of the country,
it appeared, that it pre&s;ented no advantages to
the natives, which it did not hold forth to the
invaders. That, on the contrary, it was rather
more favourable to the latter, than to the
former. That its great rivers, in&s;tead of co|vering
the retreat of the rebels, by being navi|gable,
laid them open to fre&s;h misfortunes,
from an enemy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the command of
the &s;ea. That Hud&s;on's River, in particular, by
dividing the whole continent from North to

South, formed a natural and &s;trong barrier,
between the revolted provinces. That the
&s;eizing this barrier was an object of the fir&s;t
con&s;equence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Evidence, p. 51.</NOTE>, towards the extinction of the
rebellion. That this object might have been
ea&s;ily obtained, as the river pre&s;ents an excel|lent

(170 miles) by means of Hud&s;on's River, in two days."
<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 47. 75.</NOTE>. That
this great advantage rendered the co-operation
of the main army, with the troops coming
from Canada, as obvious, as it was ea&s;y and ex|peditious;
and that, it was the want of &s;uch
co-operation, that ruined the Northern expe|dition<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">"Many feared that general Burgoyne's army would

<P>In the cour&s;e of the Evidence taken at home,
and more e&s;pecially by the mo&s;t authentic in|formation
from abroad, it has appeared, that the
<PB N="37" REF="40">
injudicious and inactive management of the
war has been the &s;ole ob&s;tacle, to the re&s;toration
of peace. That a very great majority of the peo|ple

exhibiting their loyalty to their Sovereign and
their aver&s;ion to u&s;urpation, by the de&s;ultory
manner, in which the war was conducted, on
our part; as it deprived them of permanent
protection, and left them expo&s;ed to the in&s;o|lence,
cruelty, and revenge of their enemies.</P>
<P>That the quitting of the Jer&s;eys, and the <HI>go|ing
to &s;ea,</HI> with the whole army in July 1777,
terrified other provinces from &s;ubmitting, for
fear of being de&s;erred. That the three Dela|ware

That their application having either
been di&s;regarded or neglected, they adhered
to the u&s;urped government. That, as a gene|ral

which accompany &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war.
That no per&s;on of great con&s;equence, and few
of any con&s;equence at all, &s;ubmitted after
tho&s;e events. That, when a re&s;olution was for|med
to evacuate Philadelphia, &s;uch as had
&s;ubmitted were <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> to make their peace

per&s;ons, who followed that advice, fell a &s;acri|fice,
to the relentle&s;s violence and unforgiving
tyranny of the rebels. That, in &s;hort, the want
of protection on the one &s;ide, and the certain|ty
of puni&s;hment for defection, on the other,
eradicated every hope from the minds of the
loyal, and forced them to &s;wear allegiance to
an u&s;urpation, which they de&s;pi&s;ed and abhor|red.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="42">
Though the&s;e facts came forward with a
force, which commanded conviction, the fac|tion
adhered, with invincible ob&s;tinacy, to the
line of their former conduct. With their u&s;ual
in&s;ult, upon the common feelings and common
&s;en&s;e of mankind, they e&s;tabli&s;hed fal&s;e pre|mi&s;es,
and deduced, from tho&s;e premi&s;es, ar|guments
for the total dereliction, and con&s;e|quently,
for the dependance of America.
They affirmed, that rebellion can never be ex|tingui&s;hed;
though the want of vigour, in pur|&s;uing
our &s;ucce&s;&s;es, has been the demon&s;trable
cau&s;e of its continuing &s;o long. They a&s;&s;erted,
that a general unanimity prevails again&s;t Great
Britain; though the adherence of the people
to the congre&s;s proceeded, from our not af|fording
them a permanent protection, under
the &s;helter of our arms. They alleged, that the
courage of the rebels, and the natural &s;trength
of their country, are un&s;urmountable ob&s;ta|cles;
though the fir&s;t &s;eldom appear in the
field, but to fly, and the latter opens every
where its bo&s;om to inva&s;ion, by the means of
exten&s;ive arms of the &s;ea, and many great and
navigable rivers.</P>
<P>When we deny other public virtues to Op|po&s;ition,
we mu&s;t allow, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s the
negative merit of con&s;i&s;tency in their political
<PB N="40" REF="43">
conduct. They &s;truck one key, at the begin|ning
of the American troubles, and they have
ever &s;ince continued the &s;ame note, or impro|ved
upon it, as events aro&s;e. When the tu|mults
began at Bo&s;ton, when licentiou&s;ne&s;s and
riot exhibited their fir&s;t wild &s;cenes, in Fa|neuil-Hall,
they encouraged the piece, by ap|plauding
the actors. The prints of the depar|ting
&s;teps of Freedom, like tho&s;e of A&s;traea,
were only to be found, they affirmed, round
the <HI>Tree</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> on Bo&s;ton Common. A
gloomy de&s;poti&s;m had &s;eized Great Britain at
home, and it became nece&s;&s;ary, that her hands
&s;hould be &s;ettered, to prevent the recovery of
her authority abroad. Every effort on the part
of the Mother-country was an exertion of ty|ranny;
every re&s;i&s;tance, in the colonies, was
an in&s;tance of public virtue. The grim tyrant,
Arbitrary Power, had taken up arms again&s;t
that <HI>innocent</HI> little child, American Liberty;
and to defend the weak again&s;t the &s;trong was
a &s;ervice of much reputation and little danger.</P>
<P>Obvious as the deceptions, held forth by the
party, <HI>ought</HI> to have been, they were attended
with &s;ucce&s;s, both <HI>without</HI> and <HI>within</HI> doors.
The people thought, that a&s;&s;ertions, &s;o confi|dently
and &s;o often repeated, had &s;ome found|ation
in truth; and, though Government knew
<PB N="41" REF="44">
the contrary, they acted, as if they gave them
credit. The con&s;equence was, that languid
mea&s;ures were adopted, when vigour and exer|tion
were nece&s;&s;ary; and, thus, by the for|bearance
of Admini&s;tration, the encourage|ment
of Oppo&s;ition, the inactivity or inability
of commanders, that mon&s;ter, REBELLION,
which &s;hould have been &s;tifled as &s;oon as born,
was fo&s;tered and reared to maturity.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for this country, Oppo&s;ition
were permitted, in a manner, to take the lead
in American mea&s;ures. War, and e&s;pecially
rebellion, being one of the greate&s;t evils, that
can afflict a &s;tate, the mo&s;t &s;peedy and power|ful
remedies mu&s;t be applied, to remove the
di&s;ea&s;e. The only certain road to peace lies
through exertion and victory. An anxiety for
negociation, being generally a mark of weak|ne&s;s,
too often encourages an enemy to a conti|nuation
of re&s;i&s;tance. It has al&s;o a mo&s;t unfa|vourable
effect on the &s;pirit of the people, a|mong
who&s;e leaders &s;uch anxiety appears. This
double con&s;ideration had rendered the propo|&s;ing
terms a favourite topic of patriotic elo|quence.
To depre&s;s the minds of their coun|trymen,
to elevate tho&s;e of the rebels; to make
the fir&s;t to doubt, the &s;econd to become con|fident
of &s;ucce&s;s; to keep up, if the expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="42" REF="45">
may be u&s;ed, the ball of contention between
the parties, were circum&s;tances that probably
might lengthen the di&s;pute to the verge
of &s;ome public misfortune; that misfortune,
if it favoured not the views of ambition,
might, at lea&s;t, be turned to the purpo&s;es of
revenge.</P>
<P>The calamity expected, with &s;o much anxi|ety,
by Oppo&s;ition, at length arrived. An ar|my
was lo&s;t in America. A rebellion, which
&s;eemed to &s;tagger under partial and ill-pur&s;u|ed
defeats, became firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by vic|tory.
The &s;pirits of the country began to &s;ink;
and the Faction added to the general depre&s;&s;i|on,
by their unmanly oratory. In&s;tead of pro|po&s;ing
tho&s;e vigorous exertions, which the ho|nour,
as well as intere&s;t of the nation required,
they recommended a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to re|bels;
an acknowledgment of former errors,
and a&s;&s;urances of future amendment. The
world, in general, a&s;cribed to artifice a con|duct
which could not be reconciled to the prin|ciples
of common &s;en&s;e. Was it probable that
in&s;urgents, who had offered no terms during
their misfortunes, would receive any in the
moment of victory? Or could it be expected,
that a Congre&s;s, who had declared for inde|pendence,
when thirty thou&s;and di&s;ciplined
&s;oldiers were ready to land on the coa&s;t, would
<PB N="43" REF="46">
relinqui&s;h that independence, after they had
made a whole army pri&s;oners of war?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;anguine lovers of tranquility
could &s;carcely derive any hopes from this pa|cific
&s;y&s;tem; but it was adopted. The Faction
thus obtained that degradation of their own
country, which &s;eems to have been uniformly
a part of their plan. But as it had been ju&s;tly
apprehended, that American re&s;i&s;tance might,
at la&s;t, cea&s;e, through the failure of American
re&s;ources, it had become nece&s;&s;ary to procure
powerful allies, for the &s;upport of the cau&s;e.
The defeat and capture of the army, under
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne, had certainly its weight in
the French cabinet. But the deplorable pic|ture
given, in both Hou&s;es, of the &s;tate of this
kingdom, could only induce France to throw
her weight into the &s;cale of America.</P>
<P>The weight of France having been found
in&s;ufficient in the operations of the la&s;t &s;um|mer,
the nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining <HI>another</HI> ally, to
the <HI>cau&s;e of Liberty,</HI> became apparent during
the winter. Every encouragement and every
lure were held out to Spain. Under a pretence
of bewailing their unfortunate country, Oppo|&s;ition
expo&s;ed her weakne&s;s. Their own decla|mations
&s;hewed that her councils were di&s;|tracted
by faction; and their a&s;&s;ertions, rela|tive
<PB N="44" REF="47">
to the &s;tate of her navy and army, repre|&s;ented
her to foreigners as an ea&s;y prey. To
bring the certainty of her approaching ruin to
a point of demon&s;tration, &s;ome theori&s;ts, ac|quainted
with figures, were employed to make
fictitious &s;tates of her finances. Even &s;ome of
the party had the folly, or rather pre&s;umption,
to a&s;&s;ert, in public, that the very indepen|dence
of Great Britain was in the power of
the hou&s;e of Bourbon<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Contemptible as &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions may &s;eem, at home,

<P>The phlegmatic councils of Spain were, how|ever,
too &s;low for the fire and vehemence of
her Briti&s;h friends. Though their eloquence
had its proper influence at Madrid, that <HI>de&s;ira|ble</HI>
circum&s;tance had been concealed in "Ca&s;|tilian
taciturnity." Deprived almo&s;t of every
hope, from the other &s;ide of the Bay of Bi&s;cay,
the eyes of our Patriots were again turned to
the regions beyond the Atlantic. As the treaty
<PB N="45" REF="48">
attempted la&s;t &s;ummer had &s;topt the operati|ons
of war, it was expedient to throw negoti|ation
in the way of ho&s;tility in the pre&s;ent year.
Though the party had reprobated their <HI>own</HI>
mea&s;ure, the conciliatory bills, as degrading
and di&s;graceful, they propo&s;ed the renewal of
the commi&s;&s;ion, which tho&s;e bills authorized.
This mode of relief, or rather re&s;pite, to rebel|lion,
having been refu&s;ed, the old propo&s;al, of
withdrawing the troops from America, was
renewed. This la&s;t effort was al&s;o un&s;ucce&s;s|ful;

&s;eems, had grievou&s;ly offended this froward
Dame; but how or where, &s;he could not
tell. When &s;he has time to recollect the cir|cum&s;tances,
BUCCARELLI, or &s;ome other old
Spani&s;h acquaintance, will, no doubt, com|municate
them to C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r&eacute;, and then we
&s;hall know the whole.</P>
<P>The uniform conduct of Oppo&s;ition &s;eemed
calculated, if not intended, to arm Spain in fa|vour
of France and America; yet they affect|ed
a degree of melancholy when that event was
announced. With a pernicious con&s;i&s;tency,
they dwelt on the weakne&s;s of Great Britain,
and on the force of her enemies. In&s;tead of
&s;tanding forth with that manly boldne&s;s, which
other patriots have either felt or feigned, in
times of peril, they unbraced the nerves of their
country with womani&s;h lamentations. To
magnify the danger, they pretended to recom|mend
unanimity; and to promife &s;upport to
the S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n, whil&s;t they undermined his ju&s;t
influence and authority. But the notes of af|fected
&s;orrow were &s;oon changed for the voice
<PB N="47" REF="50">
of di&s;cord; and it became apparent, that the
party lamented their own condition more than
the &s;tate of their country.</P>
<P>In the preceding detail, many circum&s;tan|ces
are omitted, equally de&s;criptive of the
conduct, and expre&s;&s;ive of the de&s;igns of Op|po&s;ition,
with tho&s;e that have been related.
But, as the intention of this E&s;&s;ay is only
to give a general idea of the &s;ubject, it was
thought unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cend to every par|ticular.
One obvious ob&s;ervation will natural|ly
&s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf to the mind of the Reader:
That an Oppo&s;ition begun in ambition, has
degenerated, through di&s;appointment, into a
&s;pecies of infinity; and that, in attempting
to ruin the Mini&s;try, the party have given a
fatal &s;tab to the honour and intere&s;ts of their
country.</P>
<P>In every popular government, oppo&s;ition is
not only natural, but, when conducted on libe|ral
principles, u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary.
There is a kind of charm in authority, which
may induce the mo&s;t virtuous magi&s;trates to
extend it too far, if &s;ubject to no controul.
The original object of a national repre&s;entative,
was to watch over the political rights of the
executive power. The tru&s;t is great; and,
&s;trictly &s;peaking, ought to be &s;olely appro|priated
<PB N="48" REF="51">
to the public good. Tho&s;e who u&s;e it
as an engine of private ambition and per&s;onal
inrere&s;t, meet with forgivene&s;s, on account of
the frequency of the practice. But the employ|ing
a weapon, given for the defence of our
country, again&s;t its exi&s;tence, is a &s;pecies of
political a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination which no example can
ju&s;tify, no &s;tate ought to pa&s;s without puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>If the great lines of the conduct of Oppo&s;iti|on,
during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, have
been fairly traced, in the preceding di&s;qui&s;iti|on,
no terms can be too &s;evere, no indignati|on
too violent, in expo&s;ing the principles and
plans of the party. If the account, which has
been given of their a&s;&s;ertions and actions, has
been exaggerated, the Public will judge of
both with more candour. But, unfortunately
for Great Britain, the &s;tamp of truth has been
affixed to the repre&s;entation, contained in this
E&s;&s;ay, by the mo&s;t uncontrovertible of all argu|ments,
the events of the times: events unparal|leled
in the hi&s;tory of any other age or country.</P>
<P>Let the con&s;equences of an oppo&s;ite conduct,
in the party, be con&s;idered, for a moment.
Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, in&s;tead of abetting re|bellion
and encouraging foreign war, they had
declared that, when the American Congre&s;s
<PB N="49" REF="52">
avowed Independence, and e&s;pecially when they
leagued with France, the grounds of the origi|nal
que&s;tion were entirely changed. That, as
friends of their country, they had re&s;olved to
&s;trengthen her hands, to re&s;tore her authority,
to protect her intere&s;ts, and to recover her ho|nour.
That the object of their pur&s;uit had been
to render Mini&s;ters re&s;pon&s;ible for remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in
carrying on the war; or for ob&s;tinacy in refu&s;ing
adequate and honourable conditions of peace.
That they had been the fir&s;t to inquire into the
failure of mea&s;ures in the execution; not to
a&s;&s;ert without examination, that the error lay
in the cabinet and not in the field. That they
had taken mea&s;ures to a&s;certain, by what mi&s;|management
or mi&s;conduct, in commanders, an
army had been lo&s;t, to a contemptible enemy,
and a &s;uperior fleet had returned from action,
without a victory? That, in&s;tead of receiving
into the bo&s;om of their party, a general, who
had quitted his command in the mid&s;t of war,
they had inquired, why the advantages, he
either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or obtained, had not been more
deci&s;ively improved?</P>
<P>To render &s;till more fini&s;hed the picture of
the rever&s;e of their actual proceedings, let it be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of announcing, to all
Europe, the weakne&s;s of Great Britain, they
<PB N="50" REF="53">
had, in their &s;peeches and their actions, exhi|bited
a &s;pirited and di&s;intere&s;ted love for their
country, an unanimity to arm her exertions,
not to clog her mea&s;ures, a manly boldne&s;s to
meet, to break, to di&s;concert the combinations
of her dome&s;tic and foreign enemies. What
would have been, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation of public affairs? What the &s;tate of
public opinion, relative to them&s;elves? The re|&s;i&s;tance
of America mu&s;t have cea&s;ed. France
might have given up the conte&s;t; and the junc|tion
of Spain would have been prevented.</P>
<P>One &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it hardly po&s;&s;ible, that an
Oppo&s;ition, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal men, who&s;e rank
and fortune connect their private intere&s;t with
that of the public, &s;hould follow a line of con|duct,
that leads to the de&s;truction of their coun|try,
and, con&s;equently, to their own ruin. This
is an argument which they them&s;elves repeat, and
think unan&s;werable. The truth is, that every
faction may avail it&s;elf of the &s;ame argument;
but general rea&s;oning mu&s;t fall to the ground,
when contradicted by facts. There is a pride
and ob&s;tinacy in party, which di&s;dain to ac|knowledge
error; and, therefore, though Op|po&s;ition
may, nay mu&s;t, perceive the pernicious
tendency of their conduct, they choo&s;e to per&s;i&s;t,
rather than own a fault.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54">
An opportunity offered it&s;elf lately, which
might have reflected credit on Oppo&s;ition, with|out
the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;grace of changing their
former opinions. The Spani&s;h <HI>Re&s;cript</HI> fur|ni&s;hed
this opportunity; yet the nation cannot
&s;ee, without indignation and a&s;toni&s;hment, that
ACTS indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of
the State have been combated, with all the vi|rulence
and ob&s;tinacy of oratory, in every &s;tage
of their progre&s;s. That the party clogged every
mea&s;ure for arming the kingdom, by &s;ea and
land, while they a&s;&s;erted, that the enemy were
ready to invade our coa&s;t, and that a few days
might bring the report of their guns to the ears
of both hou&s;es of parliament. That, when a
&s;pirit of unanimity and exertion became the duty
of all lovers of their country, the faction an|nounced,
with a &s;pecies of &s;avage triumph, that
the City of London would not vote a man
or a &s;hilling, for the national defence in the pre|&s;ent
emergency. That, in &s;hort, they pre&s;umed to
a&s;&s;ert in public, that the tyranny of France and
Spain would be more welcome to them, than
the continuance of their rivals in power.</P>
<P>After &s;uch proofs of aver&s;ion to the public
good, it will be in vain to hope for any reform|ation
in Oppo&s;ition. The di&s;tre&s;s in which they
have involved their country, can advance but
<PB N="52" REF="55">
one &s;tep farther, to furni&s;h them with an oppor|tunity
of retreating from the line of their mi&s;con|duct.
That &s;tep is an inva&s;ion of this I&s;land,
the la&s;t effort of the con&s;piracy of our foreign
enemies. In that critical moment, a moment
which every good &s;ubject would meet with &s;pirit
and confidence in his cau&s;e, there is every rea|&s;on
to fear, that Oppo&s;ition would be &s;till an
Oppo&s;ition. Such has been the inveteracy which
a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of criminality, a jealou&s;y of rivals,
a habit of oppo&s;ing the intere&s;ts and degrading
the dignity of their country; and a de&s;pair em|bittered
by an unpopular and fruitle&s;s conte&s;t of
many years, have mixed with every &s;pring of
their actions, every power of their minds.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we may fairly affirm,
that neither the talents they po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor the
conduct they have pur&s;ued, are likely to re|commend
Oppo&s;ition as proper per&s;ons for ma|naging
public affairs at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is. If
our &s;ituation is alarming, we mu&s;t look for re|lief
to the re&s;ources of the kingdom, and the
&s;pirit of our countrymen, and not to tho&s;e, who
have uniformly endeavoured to depreciate the
fir&s;t, and to damp the &s;econd. The truth is,
that, very fortunately for this country, this
de&s;ponding party have hitherto failed in their
views of convincing us that our ruin is inevitable.
<PB N="53" REF="56">
We feel the contrary, in the internal vigour of
the &s;tate, and in that unanimity of &s;entiment
among the people, which forbids us to connect
danger with de&s;pair.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould either be mentioned, upon
the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion? This country, with much
&s;maller re&s;ources, and much le&s;s unanimity, has
repeatedly weathered more dreadful &s;torms than
tho&s;e which only <HI>&s;eem</HI> to threaten it at pre&s;ent.
In the fir&s;t Dutch war, France and Denmark
joined the enemy again&s;t England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In 1665, 1666, &amp;c. <HI>Vide</HI> Life of Clarendon,
Burnet, Rapin, Ralph, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. She had
no friendly port on the continent, from the Pyre|nees
to the pole; no ally but the Bi&s;hop of
Mun&s;ter. The Dutch came out, to a deci&s;ive
battle, with one hundred and thirteen &s;hips of
war, eleven fire-&s;hips, and &s;even yatchts; led by
able, experienced, and brave commanders.
France, co-operating with her allies, entered
the Channel with forty &s;hips of the line. The
u&s;ual revenue of England amounted only to the
annual &s;um of one million two hundred thou|&s;and
pounds; and the &s;upplies granted, for the
year, exceeded not double that &s;um. Our
&s;tanding army &s;carcely con&s;i&s;ted of five thou|&s;and
men; and there was no militia in the king|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">
The nation was, in the mean time, vi&s;ited
with two of the mo&s;t dreadful calamities that
can afflict a people, pe&s;tilence and fire. Near
eighty thou&s;and per&s;ons had been carried off by
the fir&s;t, in London alone. The city had become
a kind of de&s;ert; and gra&s;s was ob&s;erved to
grow in the middle of Cheap&s;ide<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 637.</NOTE>. The
plague followed tho&s;e who fled to the country;
and terror and death filled every corner of the
kingdom. This &s;courge was followed by a
fire, which con&s;umed fifteen out of the twenty|&s;ix
wards of the city, con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred
&s;treets and lanes, thirteen thou&s;and hou&s;es, and
eighty-nine pari&s;h-churches<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vide Clarendon, Heath, Burnet.</NOTE>. But the&s;e mi&s;|fortunes
neither damped the &s;pirits of the
people, nor ob&s;tructed the mea&s;ures of Govern|ment.
Our fleets, though much inferior, fought,
and vanqui&s;hed the enemy. The alliance again&s;t
us was broken, and an honourable and advan|tageous
peace was obtained.</P>
<P>In the year 1690, the French fleet entered
the Engli&s;h channel, appeared before Plymouth,
on the 20th of June, drove the combined fleets
of England and Holland, from the back, of the
i&s;le of Wight, engaged and totally defeated
them, in a general battle, near Beachy-head.
<PB N="55" REF="58">
In this unfortunate action we lo&s;t eight &s;hips of
the line, be&s;ides many more, that were rendered
unfit for &s;ervice; and the &s;hattered remains of
the fleet were forced to &s;helter them&s;elves in the
Thames<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lord Torrington's Letter, July 1, 1690.</NOTE>. The French rode triumphant,
for &s;ome months, in the Channel. They in|&s;ulted
our &s;ea-ports; and threatened our coa&s;ts
with inva&s;ion. There were, at the time, no
more than <HI>five thou&s;and</HI> regular troops in Eng|land;
the militia were not arrayed; King Wil|liam
was, in a manner, confined to Ireland, by
the &s;uperiority of the enemy at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The nation was, at the &s;ame time, di&s;|tracted
and divided in opinion, on account
of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Public credit, du|ring
the whole war, was &s;o low, that &s;oon
after this period, Exchequer and Navy Bills
became almo&s;t of as little value, as the pa&s;te|board
dollars of the American Congre&s;s; and
even the notes of the Bank of England were
at <HI>forty per cent.</HI> di&s;count<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Kennet, Ralph, Burnet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. Near <HI>&s;ix thou|&s;and</HI>
trading ve&s;&s;els were taken by the French in
the cour&s;e of the war<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vide Journals of the Commons, 169<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e misfortunes, the vigour of Government
and &s;pirit of the people &s;urmounted all difficul|ties
<PB N="56" REF="59">
The enemy was di&s;appointed, in all his
ambitious views, an honourable peace was ob|tained,
the revolution confirmed, the prote&s;t|ant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ecured, and public credit re|&s;tored.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent times, our re&s;ources are much
greater, our &s;pirit equal, and our danger le&s;s,
than at either of tho&s;e periods. We have an
ample revenue, an untainted credit, a great and
a growing navy. In&s;tead of <HI>five thou&s;and</HI> men,
we have above <HI>&s;ixty thou&s;and</HI> di&s;ciplined troops,
for our internal defence; and we have a certain
pro&s;pect of half as many more, in the &s;pace of
a few months. A &s;pirit of unanimity, vigour,
and exertion, begins to pervade the whole king|dom.
Our nobility and gentry, with a &s;pirit
becoming Britons, either &s;erve in our con&s;titu|tional
defence, the militia, or with their in|fluence
and pur&s;es exert them&s;elves, in rai&s;ing
new corps. The greate&s;t commercial &s;ociety,
in the kingdom, has &s;et a noble example to
their fellow-&s;ubjects, by an unanimous and
powerful aid to the &s;tate, in the pre&s;ent emer|gency.
Voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions, for rai&s;ing &s;ol|diers,
and for giving a bounty to &s;ailors, have
been opened, in &s;everal places; and the &s;ame
&s;pirit will diffu&s;e it&s;elf through both the Briti&s;h
i&s;les. Such as are debarred, by infirmities and
<PB N="57" REF="60">
years, from per&s;onal &s;ervice, will undoubtedly
exhibit, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, their love for
their country, and their zeal for its &s;afety.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of being depre&s;&s;ed, with a &s;en&s;e of
danger, all ranks and degrees of men feel that
elevation, which threatened perils excite, in
generous minds. In&s;tead of looking forward to
future di&s;graces or di&s;a&s;ters, they reflect on the
glory of former times. The po&s;terity of tho&s;e,
who conquered at Poictiers, Cre&s;&s;y, and Agin|court,
and annexed France it&s;elf to the Engli&s;h
crown, cannot form to them&s;elves any fears from
a French inva&s;ion. On the contrary, when they
have &s;ufficiently prepared for &s;ecurity at home,
they will act offen&s;ively abroad; and carry back
to the bo&s;om of the enemy that terror, which
he vainly hopes to create.</P>
<P>If we are at war in America, we have
not the burden of a continental war; that
&s;ink, in which our trea&s;ure has always di&s;|appeared,
without any hope of return. The
money laid out on our navy, or expended in
our Colonies, will return to the center of the
kingdom, through all the veins of commerce.
Our trade has been protected, again&s;t the ene|my,
to a degree unknown in any former war.
We have lo&s;t, in no quarter of the world, any
<PB N="58" REF="61">
territory without an equivalent; in &s;ome we
have gained. In the We&s;t Indies, we are &s;till
&s;uperior to our Enemies. We have eradicated
them entirely from the Ea&s;t Indies, and we
have a flattering pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy termina|tion
of re&s;i&s;tance, in North America.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage of a war, the advantage of
attack is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by that nation, who fir&s;t
breaks the peace. The di&s;advantages of de|fence
mu&s;t, for &s;ome time, remain with its op|ponent.
A &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch exten&s;ive do|minions,
as Great Britain, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed,
to be invulnerable, on every &s;ide. We may
&s;uffer &s;ome lo&s;&s;es, at the beginning; for what
people was ever uniformly &s;ucce&s;sful in war?
The Romans them&s;elves were not always invinci|ble.
They frequently lo&s;t provinces and ar|mies;
yet they ro&s;e &s;uperior to all nations. The
profits and lo&s;&s;es of war can only be e&s;timated,
on the day, which concludes a peace. Let us
be unanimous among our&s;elves, and that day
cannot be di&s;tant, di&s;advantageous, or di&s;ho|nourable;
on the contrary, it will be attended
with that glory, which the &s;pirit and exertion of
a great &s;tate cannot fail to acquire.</P>
