<P>As your wi&s;hes produced the piece, and your performance has rai&s;ed it into &s;ome con&s;equence, to whom can it be &s;o properly addre&s;s'd? You were before rank'd in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of our Theatrical Genui&s;es, and now you have the additional merit of tran&s;|forming the GRECIAN DAUGHTER into

<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Mr. BATES! when I thought my happine&s;s compleat, and wanted only my Uncle's con&s;ent, to give me the independance he &s;o often has promis'd me, he came to Scarborough for that purpo&s;e, and wi&s;h'd me joy of my choice; but in le&s;s than a week, his approbation turned into a pa&s;&s;ion for her; he now hates the &s;ight of me, and is re&s;olv'd with the con&s;ent of the father to make her his wife directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he keeps you out of your fortune, won't give his con&s;ent, which his Brother's fooli&s;h will requires, and he would marry him&s;elf the &s;ame wo|man, becau&s;e right, title, con&s;cience, nature, ju&s;|tice, and every law divine and human, are again&s;t it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus he tricks me at once both of wife and for|tune, without the lea&s;t want of either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well &s;aid friend WHITTLE! but it can't be, it &s;han't be, and it mu&s;t not be&mdash;this is murder and robbery in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e, and he &s;han't be hang'd in chains to be laugh'd at by the whole town if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am di&s;tracted, the widow is di&s;tre&s;s'd, and we both &s;hall run mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A widow too!&mdash;'gad a mercy three &s;core and five!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uch a widow! &s;he is now in town with her father, who wants to get her off his hands; 'tis equal to him who has her, &s;o &s;he is provided for&mdash;I hear &s;omebody coming&mdash;I mu&s;t away to her lodgings, where &s;he waits for me to execute a &s;cheme directly for our delivery.</P>

<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>The affair of marriage is in this country put upon the ea&s;ie&s;t footing; there is neither love or hate in the matter; nece&s;&s;ity brings them together; they are united at fir&s;t for their mutual conveni|ence, and &s;eperated ever after for their particular plea&s;ures.&mdash;O rare matrimony!&mdash;Where does &s;he lodge?</P>

<P>Which is a wonder, con&s;idering how the times go, Mr. BATES,&mdash;they'll wear and tear me too, if I don't take care of my &s;elf&mdash;my old ma&s;ter has taken the neare&s;t way to wear him&s;elf out, and all that be|long to him.</P>

<P>You never &s;aw &s;uch an alter'd man in your born days!&mdash;he's grown young again; he fri&s;ks, and prances, and runs about, as if he had a new pair of legs&mdash;he has left off his brown camlet &s;urtout, which he wore all &s;ummer, and now with his hat under his arm, he goes open brea&s;ted, and he dre&s;&s;es, and powders, and &s;mirks &s;o, that you would take
<PB N="6" REF="10">
him for the mad Frenchman in Bedlam&mdash;&s;ome|thing wrong in his upper &s;tory&mdash;would you think it?&mdash;he wants me to have a pig-tail!</P>

<P>As &s;ure as you are there, Mr. BATES, a pig-tail!&mdash;we have had &s;ad work about it&mdash;I made a com-promi&s;e with him, to wear the&s;e ruffled &s;hirts which he gave me&mdash;but they &s;tand in my way&mdash;I am not &s;o li&s;tle&s;s with them&mdash;tho' I have ty'd up my hands for him, I won't tie up my head, that I am re&s;olute.</P>

<P>He may make free with him&s;elf, he &s;han't make a fool of me,&mdash;he has got his head into a bag but I won't have a pig-tail tack'd to mine&mdash;and &s;o I told him&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you tell him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That as I, and my father, and his father before me, had wore their own hair as heaven had &s;ent it, I thought my&s;elf rather too old to &s;et up for a monkey at my time of life, and wear a pig-tail&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;he took it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>With a wry face, for it was wormwood:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes he was frump'd, and call'd me old block|head, and would not &s;peak to me the re&s;t of the
<PB N="7" REF="11">
day&mdash;but the next day he was at it again&mdash;he then put me into a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and I could not help telling him, that I was an Engli&s;hman born and had my prerogative as well as he, and that as long as I had breath in my body, I was for liberty, and a &s;trait head of hair!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well &s;aid, THOMAS&mdash;he could not an&s;wer that.</P>

<P>The poore&s;t man in England is a match for the greate&s;t, if he will but &s;tick to the laws of the land, and the &s;tatue books, as they are deliver'd down from us to our fore fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right&mdash;we mu&s;t lay our wits together, and drive the widow out of your old ma&s;ter's head, and put her into your young ma&s;ter's hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart&mdash;nothing can be more meri|torious&mdash;marry at his years! what a terrible ac|count would he make of it, Mr. BATES?&mdash;let me &s;ee&mdash;on the debtor &s;ide 65&mdash;and per contra creditor a buxom widow of 23.&mdash;He'll be a bankrupt in a fortnight&mdash;he! he! he!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o he would, Mr. THOMAS&mdash;what have you got in your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pamphlet my old gentleman takes in&mdash;he has left off buying hi&s;tories and religious pieces by numbers, as he us'd to do, and &s;ince he has got this widow in his head he reads nothing but the

<P>Mr. WHIZZLE, your humble &s;arvant; it gives me grate plea&s;ure, that an old Jontleman of your property, will have the honour of being united with the family of the O' Neale's; we have been too much Jontlemen, not to &s;pend our e&s;tate, as

you have made your&s;elf a kind of Jontleman by getting one; one runs out one way, and t'other runs in another, which makes them both meet at la&s;t, and keeps up the ballance of Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much oblig'd to you, Sir PATRICK; I am an old gentleman, you &s;ay true; and I was thinking&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I was thinking if you were ever &s;o old, my daughter can't make you young again; &s;he has as fine rich tick blood in her veins, as any in all Ire|land. I wi&s;h you had a &s;wate crater of a daugh|ter like mine, that we might make a double cro&s;s of it.</P>

<P>Yes, but I am no brave man, Sir PATRICK, and I begin to &s;hrink already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have bred her up in great &s;ubjiction; &s;he is as tame as a young colt, and as tinder as a &s;ucking chicken; you will find her a true Jontlewoman, and &s;o knowing, that you can tache her nothing; &s;he brings every thing but money, and you have enough of that, if you have nothing el&s;e, and that is what I call the ballance of things.</P>

<P>To be &s;ure you have, but you can't help that; and if my daughter was to mention any thing of a fleering at your age, or your &s;tingine&s;s, by the ballance of power but I would make her repate it a hundred times to your face, to make her a&s;ham'd of it; but mum, old gentleman, the devil a word of your infirmities will &s;he touch upon; I have brought her up to &s;oftne&s;s, and to gentlene&s;s, as a kitten to new milk; &s;he will &s;pake nothing but no, and yes, as if &s;he were dumb; and no tame rabbit or pigeon will keep hou&s;e, or be more inga|nious with her needle and tambourine.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Till you are married, you mean&mdash;with all my heart, it is the more gentale for that, and like our family: I never &s;aw lady O'Nale, your mother-in-law, who poor crater is dead, and can never be a mother-in-law again, 'till the week before I married her, and I did not care if I had never &s;een her
