<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Make no que&s;tion, but that all tho&s;e Gen|tlemen, who &s;hall happen to be offend|ed at the Newne&s;s and Boldne&s;s of the Po&s;itions, which are the &s;ubject of the following Treati&s;e, will accu&s;e me of want of Judgment, not only for advancing 'em, but for daring to bring 'em under the pro|tection of &s;o di&s;cerning a Judge as your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
But I de&s;ire tho&s;e Gentlemen to believe, that if I had had a mind that my faults &s;hould have lain conceal'd, or would have con&s;ulted my own more than the publick advantage, your Lord&s;hip is the per&s;on to whom of all mankind I would la&s;t have cho&s;en to have addre&s;s'd them. That tho you had never writ your admirable E&s;&s;ay, I &s;hould have been convinc'd by your other Poems, and particularly by your <HI>Temple of Death</HI>; a Temple that is con&s;ecrated at the &s;ame time to Death and to Immortality, of your perfect knowledge in Critici&s;m, be|cau&s;e I have experience enough to be &s;atis|fied, that there never was a great Poet in the world, who was not an accompli&s;h'd Critick. <HI>Horace,</HI> who was one of the great|e&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, was in the fir&s;t Rank of Judges, and <HI>Virgil</HI> has taken care to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity one of the exacte&s;t pieces of Critici&s;m that ever was writ in the world; tho indeed it is a Critici&s;m by Examples only, of which <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> vouch&s;af'd to write the Rules above &s;ixteen hundred years afterwards.</P>
<P>Thus, my Lord, I am &s;ufficiently ac|quainted with your Character to approach you with awe; but at the &s;ame time I am convinc'd that they are mi&s;taken, who be|lieve that the mo&s;t Di&s;cerning are the mo&s;t
<PB REF="4">
Rigid Judges. I am &s;atisfied that a Write has a great deal of rea&s;on to be more ap|prehen&s;ive of half Criticks, who are govern'd by opinion, or guided by prejudice, or &s;way'd by partial affection; and who &s;ee faults but in &s;ome places, and at &s;ome par|ticular times; for &s;uch Cen&s;ors are inex|orable to the lea&s;t of our Errors. But your Lord&s;hip, who&s;e unclouded Under&s;tanding &s;ees all our faults, where-ever they are, and who knows how difficult, if not im|po&s;&s;ible, it is for us not to err, will make large allowances for the Imperfections of Humane Nature, or our particular frailties, if you di&s;cover in us the appearance of any good quality, which may be&s;peak your in|dulgence. Imperfect, partial, prejudic'd Criticks have Judgment enough to Di&s;cover Faults, but want Di&s;cernment to find out Beauties; or if at any time by chance they Di&s;cover them, they are perhaps too inte|re&s;ted, or too envious, or too fearful to own them. But as Nature, that has given you &s;o many extraordinary qualities, has con&s;pir'd with Fortune, in &s;etting your Lord&s;hip infinitely above &s;o mean a Pa&s;&s;ion as Envy; &s;o &s;he has plac'd you as far above the Imperious &s;way of opinion, that madly tyrannizes over the multitude. Your Lord|&s;hip never approves of our actions becau&s;e
<PB REF="5">
they have met with &s;ucce&s;s, but becau&s;e they de&s;erve to &s;ucceed. And here I humbly de&s;ire of your Lord&s;hip, that in behalf of all the Lovers of Poetry, I may return you thanks for the Protection and Patronage of a great man deceas'd. 'Tis known to all the ob&s;erving world, that you generou&s;ly began to e&s;pou&s;e him, when he was more than half oppre&s;t by a very formidable party in the Court of King <HI>Charles II.</HI> a faction that wanted neither Power nor Authority to cru&s;h him; who, be&s;ides that they held the foremo&s;t Rank in the State, had got po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the minds of the people, with whom they had acquir'd a great Reputation, for their Knowledge and Capacity in matters of Wit and Critici&s;m. If that great man had faults, your Lord&s;hip wanted no Di&s;cern|ment to find them; but you wanted malice, partiality, prejudice, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e ungenerous ob&s;tacles, that hindred others from di&s;covering or confe&s;&s;ing his Beauties. Your Lord&s;hip ea&s;ily found that he had Beauties which over-weigh'd all faults; and it was that con&s;ideration that engag'd you to  &s;upport him again&s;t his powerful ad|ver&s;aries. They, upon an unaccountable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> which they had taken to his per&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> have oppre&s;t his growing merit; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> con&s;ideration of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, cheri&s;h'd his per&s;on, not|with&s;tanding
<PB REF="6">
his pretended frailties; and while others, to expre&s;s their malice to the man, would have hindred the advance|ment even of that Art which they pretended to e&s;teem &s;o much; your Lord&s;hip, on the contrary, by a wi&s;e, a good natur'd, and a noble proceeding, cheri&s;h'd the man on pur|po&s;e to make him in&s;trumental in advancing the Art. And as it was after you took him into your protection, that he writ &s;e|veral of his mo&s;t valuable pieces, 'tis to your Lord&s;hip that the world is in &s;ome mea&s;ure indebted for the greater number of his excellencies.</P>
<P>And with the &s;ame greatne&s;s of mind, with which to advance a noble Art, you rais'd and &s;upported a man oppre&s;s'd by very powerful adver&s;aries; &s;o in order to the &s;ame de&s;ign, you pull'd down the Ty|ranny of publick prejudice, and of a Tri|umphant opinion. For 'tis known to all the world, that your Lord&s;hip declar'd again&s;t the Ob&s;cenity which was &s;hamefully crept in|to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry; at a time when not only that way of writing, but the Ver&s;es which you particularly hinted at, were in the very height of their Reputation. But the &s;ucce&s;s was an&s;werable to the noblene&s;s of your Lord&s;hips attempt; tho&s;e Ver&s;es have gradually declin'd ever &s;ince in their
<PB REF="7">
Reputation, and nothing of that nature will now be &s;uffer'd by any but the Rabble. So that your Lord&s;hip has done a very &s;ignal kindne&s;s not only to a noble Art, but to Vertue it&s;elf, and have highly oblig'd all vertuous men as well as lovers of Poetry.</P>
<P>My Lord, I have mentioned this the more willingly, becau&s;e it fairly gives me an opportunity of confirming by your Lord|&s;hips Authority, the a&s;&s;ertion which is the foundation of the following Treati&s;e; which is, that Religion gives a very great advan|tage for the exciting of Pa&s;&s;ion in Poetry. Your Lord&s;hip has inform'd us, that Ob|&s;cenity and Poetry are things that are in|con&s;i&s;tent. The a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t be granted by all to be unque&s;tionably true; for nothing can be po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i&s;tent with an Art, which runs counter to the very end and de&s;ign of that Art. Now the end of Poe|try is to In&s;truct and Reform, and Ob&s;ce|nity in writing corrupts the manners. But this on the other &s;ide is not to be doubted, that Ver&s;es may be produc'd from the an|cient Poets, which are at once Ob&s;cene and Poetical; tho at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that they would have been more fine, if they had been more cha&s;te. But if any one demands why Ribaldry &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Ancient Poetry, when
<PB REF="8">
it is &s;o plainly in&s;ufferable in the Modern; to him I an&s;wer, that it can be nothing but the Religion of the Ancients which makes the difference; for theirs was very con&s;i&s;t|ent with Ob&s;cenity, whereas ours entirely abhors it. A way of writing that was au|thoriz'd by their Religion, could never be &s;aid to be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with in&s;tructi|on. Be&s;ides, Pa&s;&s;ion is the principal thing in Poetry, and tho Ob&s;cenity has &s;omething too gro&s;s and ful&s;om in it, to con&s;i&s;t with the Delicacy of a tender Pa&s;|&s;ion, yet by mingling with their Ob&s;cene Ver&s;es, their <HI>Cupid,</HI> their <HI>Venus,</HI> and the re&s;t of their Amorous Divinities, they had the advantage of that other &s;ort of Pa&s;&s;ion which we call Enthu&s;ia&s;m; whereas the Di|vinity of our Religion being utterly abhor|rent of any thing which is impure, &s;uch Ri|baldry in&s;erted in our Poetry can never po&s;&s;ibly either in&s;truct or move.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of what your Lord&s;hip has done to advance Poetry, has oblig'd me to lay the following Treati&s;e at your feet; a Pre&s;ent, I confe&s;s, that is altogether un|worthy of you, but it is by much the mo&s;t valuable that either I have, or ever have had to make; and your Lord&s;hip has ac|cepted it with the &s;ame goodne&s;s that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King did the Apple: He &s;aw that
<PB REF="9">
it was all that his Subject could do to te&s;ti|fie his acknowledgment; and for that ve|ry rea&s;on it was more agreeable to him, than the vain pompous Pre&s;ents of tho&s;e who be|liev'd they could add to his Trea&s;ure. I believ'd that the very De&s;ign to improve an Art, which your Lord&s;hip has actually &s;o much advanc'd, would prevail upon your goodne&s;s to excu&s;e a great many faults, which you may find in the following Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>But upon mentioning the De&s;ign of the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e, I find my &s;elf &s;ufficient|ly perplex'd. There are &s;everal things of the la&s;t importance that ought to be prelimi|nary to the Di&s;cour&s;e it&s;elf: And I find that I have &s;trong temptations upon me of following Mr <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Example, and of &s;aying to your Lord&s;hip, what is u&s;ually directed to the Reader in general. But then I con&s;ider that I have neither Mr <HI>Dryden's</HI> great qualities, nor like him a Reputation long e&s;tabli&s;h'd, nor, what ought chiefly to be con&s;ider'd, the Honour of having often approach'd your Lord&s;hip, to authorize &s;uch a Liberty. But yet on the other &s;ide, the things that I have to &s;ay are of important con&s;equence to the good of the Cau&s;e which I have undertaken; and I find that I &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ting to that noble Cau&s;e, if I &s;hould ad|dre&s;s my &s;elf to the Reader in general; and
<PB REF="10">
I &s;hould be thought by all di&s;cerning per|&s;ons to proceed as ab&s;urdly, as would a Lawyer, who upon a &s;olemn pleading, &s;hould apply him&s;elf to the Multitude, who have little knowledge of his affair, and no Authority to determine it; in&s;tead of &s;peaking to his Awful Judge, who has a perfect knowledge of his Cau&s;e, and a So|veraign Authority to decide it.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of all Poetical Critici&s;m, mu&s;t be, if it is ju&s;t and good, to advance &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o noble an Art as Poetry. And the de&s;ign of the following Treati&s;e is no le&s;s than to &s;et the Moderns upon an equal foot with even admir'd Antiquity. In order to the doing which, I humbly de|&s;ire leave of your Lord&s;hip, that I may make an enquiry in what the preheminence of the Ancient Poets con&s;i&s;ts; and why I prefer one of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Tragedies, as for exam|ple, the <HI>Oedipus</HI> of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> to one of our celebrated <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragedies; as for in&s;tance, the <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI> Upon reflection I find that the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e I am more delighted and more in|&s;tructed by the former; and that for this very rea&s;on, becau&s;e I am more mov'd by it: For I find by experience that I am no fur|ther pleas'd nor in&s;tructed by any Tragedy, than as it excites Pa&s;&s;ion in me. But in
<PB REF="11">
order to the di&s;covering why I am more mov'd by the former than the latter of tho&s;e Tragedies, I de&s;ire leave to make an enqui|ry into the principal differences between them, and that in all probability will de|termine the matter. I find then, my Lord, that there are two very &s;ignal differences between the <HI>Oedipus</HI> and the <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> Fir&s;t, the <HI>Oedipus</HI> is exactly Ju&s;t and Re|gular, and the <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> is very Extra|vagant and Irregular. Secondly, the <HI>Oedi|pus</HI> is very Religious, and the <HI>Julius Cae|&s;ar</HI> is Irreligious. For, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your Lord&s;hips Judgment, I conceive that every Tragedy ought to be a very &s;olemn Lecture, inclucating a particular Provi|dence, and &s;howing it plainly protecting the good, and cha&s;tizing the bad, or at lea&s;t the violent; and that if it is otherwi&s;e, it is either an empty amu&s;ement, or a &s;candalous and pernicious Libel upon the government of the world. The killing of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> is either a Murder or a Lawful Action; if the killing <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is a, Lawful Action, then the killing of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> is downright Murder; and the Poet has been guilty of polluting the Seene with the blood of the very be&s;t and la&s;t of the <HI>Romans.</HI> But if the killing of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is Murder, and <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI>
<PB REF="12">
are very ju&s;tly puni&s;h'd for it; then <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> is on the other &s;ide an&s;werable for in|troducing &s;o many Noble <HI>Romans,</HI> com|mitting in the open face of an Audience, a very horrible Murder, and only puni&s;hing two of them; which proceeding gives an occa&s;ion to the people to draw a dangerous inference from it, which may be De&s;tructive to Government, and to Human Society.</P>
<P>Thus, My Lord, I have a great deal of rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the <HI>Oedipus</HI> derives its advantage from its Regularity, and its Re|ligion; and the pre&s;umption grows &s;till more &s;trong, when upon enquiry I find, that the fore-mention'd Regularity is nothing but the bringing &s;ome Rules into practice, which Ob&s;ervation and Philo&s;ophy have found requi&s;ite for the &s;urer exciting of Pa&s;|&s;ion. For as this, I think, cannot be con|te&s;ted, that of two Combatants, who have equal Strength and equal Courage, he is mo&s;t likely to have the better who has the mo&s;t addre&s;s; &s;o in a contention and prize of Poetry, between per&s;ons who have equal force of mind, he will be certain to have the ad|vantage, who is the be&s;t in&s;tructed to u&s;e his &s;trength.</P>
<P>If any of the enemies to Regularity will give them&s;elves the trouble to peru&s;e the <HI>Oedipus</HI> of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> with an impartial
<PB REF="13">
eye, he will ea&s;ily di&s;cern how in&s;trumental the Poetical Art is in leading him from Surprize to Surprize, from Compa&s;&s;ion to Terror, and from Terror to Compa&s;&s;ion a|gain, without giving him &s;o much as a time to breathe; and he will as ea&s;ily di&s;cover, how the Religion that is every where inter|mix'd with the Play, &s;hews all the Surprizes even when he lea&s;t expects this, as &s;o many immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ive effects of a particular Dreadful Providence, which make them come like &s;o many Thunder-claps from a &s;erene Heaven to confound and a&s;toni&s;h him.</P>
<P>A Poet is capacitated by that which is commonly call'd Regularity, to excite the ordinary Pa&s;&s;ions more powerfully by the con&s;titution of the Fable, and the influence which that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have both upon the words and thoughts; and Religion&punc; be&s;ides the Influence it will have upon the ordinary Pa&s;&s;ions, will be to a Poet, who has force and skill enough to make his advan|tage of it, a perpetual &s;ource of extraordi|nary Pa&s;&s;ion, which is commonly call'd En|thu&s;ia&s;m, for the &s;entiments and the expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>For what concerns Regularity, or the exciting of ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, enough has been &s;aid already. Your Lord&s;hip has par|ticularly made the Publick a Pre&s;ent, which is, I confe&s;s, but little in Volume but is mag|nificent
<PB REF="14">
in Value and Ornament; 'tis a Pre|&s;ent in Jewels, which ca&s;ts a further lu&s;tre than Trea&s;ures that take up a larger &s;pace, and is more &s;olid to tho&s;e who are near it. Our Writers have been &s;ufficiently told, that writing Regularly is writing Morally, De|cently, Ju&s;tly, Naturally, Rea&s;onably. The De&s;ign, my Lord, of the following Treati&s;e is to &s;hew of what u&s;e Religion may be to the advancement of Poetry. But becau&s;e all that has been &s;aid concerning Regularity is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a preparative to this De&s;ign, that it would be wholly u&s;ele&s;s without it, I hope your Lord&s;hip will not think it to be foreign to my purpo&s;e, if at a time when the Rules are neglected by &s;ome, and &s;lighted by others, I be&s;tow a little time in proving the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving tho&s;e; without the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of which, the following Treati&s;e will be an empty amu&s;ement, and we mu&s;t ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of making any advancement in Poetry.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving Rules to the attaining a perfection in Poetry is &s;o very apparent, that he who will give him&s;elf the trouble of Reflecting, cannot ea&s;ily doubt of it. Rules are nece&s;|&s;ary even in all the inferiour Arts, as in Painting and Mu&s;ick. If any one &s;hould pretend to draw a Picture without having ever been taught, or without knowing or
<PB REF="15">
practi&s;ing any thing of Per&s;pective or Pro|portion, but &s;hould pretend to &s;ucceed alone by the natural force of his Fancy, that man would certainly be e&s;teem'd a very Impudent and Impertinent per&s;on.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip knows that it is the very &s;ame thing in Mu&s;ick that it is in Painting. If any one &s;hould pretend to compo&s;e in parts, without under&s;tanding the grounds, that per&s;on would infallibly render him&s;elf very contemptible. Now if they plea&s;e by Rules in a le&s;s noble Art, can they rea&s;o|nably expect to plea&s;e without them in one that is more noble? If they plea&s;e not by Rules in Poetry, how mu&s;t they plea&s;e? By Chance! For this is certain, that they mu&s;t do it by one or the other, for there is no third way.</P>
<P>There is nothing in Nature that is great and beautiful, without Rule and Order; and the more Rule and Order and Harmo|ny we find in the objects that &s;trike our &s;ences, the more worthy and noble we e&s;teem them. I humbly conceive that it is the &s;ame in Art, and particularly in Poetry, which ought to be an exact imitation of Nature. Now Nature, taken in a &s;tricter &s;en&s;e, is nothing but that Rule and Order and Har|mony which we find in the vi&s;ible Creation. The Univer&s;e owes its admirable beauty to
<PB REF="16">
the Proportion, Situation and Dependance of its parts. And the little World, which we call Man, owes not only its Health and Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, nay, the continuance of its very Being to the Regularity of Mecha|nical motion, but even the &s;trength too of its boa&s;ted Rea&s;on, and the piercing force of tho&s;e a&s;piring thoughts, which are able to pa&s;s the bounds that circum&s;cribe the Univer&s;e. As Nature is Order and Rule and Harmony in the vi&s;ible World, &s;o Rea|&s;on is the very &s;ame throughout the invi&s;ible Creation. For Rea&s;on is Order and the Re&s;ult of Order. And nothing that is Ir|regular, as far as it is Irregular, ever was or ever can be either Natural or Rea&s;ona|ble. Whatever God Created he de&s;igned it Regular, and as the re&s;t of the Creatures cannot &s;werve in the lea&s;t from the Eternal Laws pre-ordain'd for them, without be|coming fearful or odious to us; &s;o Man, who&s;e mind is a Law to it&s;elf, can never in the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;s that Law, without le&s;&s;ning his Rea&s;on, and deba&s;ing his Na|ture. In fine, whatever is Irregular, either in the Vi&s;ible or Invi&s;ible World, is to the per&s;on who thinks right, except in &s;ome ve|ry extraordinary ca&s;es, either Hateful or Contemptible.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> both Nature and Rea&s;on, which But a
<PB REF="17">
two in a larger acceptation is Nature, owe their Greatne&s;s, their Beauty, their Maje&s;ty, to th eirperpetualOrder; for Order at fir&s;t made the face ofthings &s;o beautiful, and the ce&s;&s;ation of that Order would once more bring in Chaos; &s;o Poetry, which is an imi|tation of Nature, mu&s;t do the &s;ame thing. I can neither have Greatne&s;s or Real Beau|ty, if it &s;werves from the Laws which Rea|&s;on &s;everely pre&s;cribes it, and the more Ir|regular any Poetical Compo&s;ition is, the nearer it comes to extravagance and confu|&s;ion, and to non&s;ence, which is nothing.</P>
<P>But, as in &s;ome of the numberle&s;s parts which con&s;titute this beauteous all, there are &s;ome appearing irregularities, which parts notwith&s;tanding contribute with the re&s;t to compleat the Harmony of univer&s;al Nature; and as there are &s;ome &s;eeming Irregularities even in the wonderful Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Supream and Soveraign Rea&s;on, as the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the good, and flouri&s;hing of the bad, which yet at the bottom are rightly adju&s;ted, and wi&s;ely compen&s;ated, and are purpo&s;ely appointed by Divine Fore-know|ledge for the carrying on the profound De|&s;igns of Providence; &s;o, if we may compare great things with &s;mall, in the creation of the accompli&s;h'd Poem, &s;ome things may at fir&s;t &s;ight be &s;eemingly again&s;t Rea&s;on,
<PB REF="18">
which yet at the bottom are perfectly Regu|lar, becau&s;e they are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the admirable conduct of a great and a ju&s;t De&s;ign.</P>
<P>No man knows better than your Lord|&s;hip, that the Renown'd Ma&s;ters among the Ancients, <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil, &amp;c.</HI> had too much Capacity, and too much Di&s;cernment, not to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of knowing and practi&s;ing the Rules which Rea&s;on and Phi|lo&s;ophy have pre&s;cib'd to Poets. They wrote not with a little narrow De&s;ign to plea&s;e a Tumultuous tran&s;itory a&s;&s;embly, or a hand|ful of men who were call'd their Country|men; They wrote to their fellow Citizens of the Univer&s;e, to all Countries and to all Ages; and they were perfectly convinc'd that tho Caprice and Extravagance may plea&s;e the multitude, who are always fluctu|ating, and always uncertain; yet that no|thing but what is great in Rea&s;on and Na|ture, could be able to delight and in&s;truct Mankind. They were clearly convinc'd that nothing could tran&s;mit their Immortal works to po&s;terity, but &s;omething like that harmo|nious Order which maintains the Univer&s;e; that it was partly to that, they were to owe that wondrous merit, which could be able to render their Fame eternal, to extend and perpetuate the very languages in which they
<PB REF="19">
writ, and to illu&s;trate the glory of their Countries by their own.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip knows that it was towards the beginning of the la&s;t Century, that the <HI>French,</HI> a &s;ubtle and di&s;cerning Nation, began to be &s;en&s;ible of this, and upon it &s;e|veral of their extraordinary men, both Poets and Philo&s;ophers, began to cultivate Criti|ci&s;m. Upon which there follow'd two very remarkable things. For fir&s;t, the cul|tivating of the Poetical Art advanc'd their Genius's to &s;uch a height, as was unknown to <HI>France</HI> before; and &s;econd|ly, the appearing of tho&s;e great Genius's, was very in&s;trumental in &s;preading their language thro all the Chri&s;tian World; and in rai&s;ing the e&s;teem of their Nation to that degree, that it naturally prepar'd the way for their Intrigues of State, and facilitated the execution of their va&s;t De&s;igns.</P>
<P>My Lord, the&s;e alterations happen'd in <HI>France,</HI> while the <HI>French</HI> reform'd the &s;tru|cture of their Poems, by the noble models of ancient Architects; and your Lord&s;hip knows very well, that the very contrary fell out among us; while, notwith&s;tanding your generous attempt to reform us, we re&s;olv'd with an injudicious ob&s;tinacy to adhere to our <HI>Gothick</HI> and Barbarous manner. For in the fir&s;t place, our Stage has degenerated
<PB REF="20">
not only from the ta&s;te of Nature, but from the greatne&s;s it had in the time of <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> in who&s;e <HI>Coriolanus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> we &s;ee &s;omething of the Invincible Spirit of the <HI>Romans</HI>; but in mo&s;t of our Heroes which have lately appear'd on the Stage, Love has been &s;till the predominant pa&s;&s;ion, whether they have been <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Heroes; which is fal&s;e in Morality, and of &s;candalous in&s;truction, and as fal&s;e and ab&s;urd in Phy&s;icks. For Ambition makes a man a Tyrant to him&s;elf, as well as it does to others; and where it once prevails, en&s;laves the Rea&s;on, and &s;ubdues all other Pa&s;&s;ions. And it was for this very cau&s;e, if your Lord&s;hip will allow me to make this di|gre&s;&s;ion, that in the two Tragedies that I writ my &s;elf, I made Love a &s;ubordinate Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ubjected it in the one to Glory, and in the other to Friend&s;hip; that &s;o I might make them fit to entertain the wi&s;e&s;t of our Sex, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous of the other. And it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell you with what extream &s;atisfaction I heard that the la&s;t of them was not di&s;plea&s;ing to you.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, At the &s;ame time that the <HI>French</HI> has been growing almo&s;t an univer|&s;al Language, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> has been &s;o far from diffu&s;ing it&s;elf in &s;o va&s;t a manner, that I know by experience that a man may
<PB REF="21">
travel o're mo&s;t of the&s;e We&s;tern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> without meeting with three Fo|reigners, who have any tolerable knowledge of it. And yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is more &s;trong, more full, more &s;ounding, more &s;ignificant, and more harmonious than the <HI>French.</HI> I know very well, that a great many will be unwilling to allow the la&s;t; but I appeal to your Lord&s;hip if this is not a convincing proof of it, that we have Blank Ver&s;e which is not inharmonious, and the <HI>French</HI> pre|tend to no Poetical Numbers, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Rhime.</P>
<P>But it may perhaps be alledg'd, that the rea&s;on why the <HI>French</HI> has got the advantage of our language, is partly from their &s;itua|tion on the Continent, partly from the in|trigues and affairs which they have with their Neighbours, and partly becau&s;e their Language has more affinity with one of the learned Languages. But to this I an&s;wer, that the <HI>Germans</HI> are as advantageou&s;ly &s;eated as the <HI>French</HI> for diffu&s;ing their Language; and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue is ra|ther nearer related to the <HI>Latin</HI> than is the <HI>French</HI>; and all the World knows, that towards the beginning of the la&s;t Century, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> was full as bu&s;ie with their Neighbours, as the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> is now; and yet then neither the <HI>German</HI>
<PB REF="22">
nor the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue made any con&s;ide+rable progre&s;s. I will not deny, but that the &s;ituation and affairs of the <HI>French</HI> may have been of advantage to them in the dif|fu&s;ing their Language; but 'tis certainly the Learning of any Nation that is mo&s;t in|&s;trumental in it. I make no doubt, but that in Learning, which is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, and barely &s;olid, without ornament, we far &s;urpa&s;s the <HI>French.</HI> Our practical Phy&s;ici|ans have more Reputation than theirs even in <HI>France</HI> it&s;elf; and our practical Divines have acquir'd more Fame, throughout the Northern Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> than either the natives of tho&s;e places, or any of the Modern <HI>French</HI> Divines, whether they are Reform'd or Papi&s;tical. And this la&s;t is therefore the more con&s;iderable, becau&s;e they writ in our mother Tongue, whereas the Phy&s;icians have employed a learned Lan|guage. But I am very much inclin'd to be|lieve, that 'tis the polite Learning of any Nation, that contributes mo&s;t to the extend|ing its Language, and Poetry is the branch of polite Learning, which is the mo&s;t effica|cious in it. In order to the proving this, I de&s;ire your Lord&s;hips leave, to examine who they are who are mo&s;t In&s;trumental in making a Language pa&s;s the bounds which confine the original &s;peakers of it. And
<PB REF="23">
they &s;eem to me to be the Gentlemen of neighbouring Nations, who have time and opportunity to vi&s;it foreign Countries, and are capacitated by their Fortunes and their Educations, to cultivate Languages, which they were not born to &s;peak. For, be&s;ides that the&s;e are the per&s;ons who are the mo&s;t capacitated to learn them, they have by the variety and multiplicity of their conver&s;a|tion mo&s;t opportunities to &s;pread them. Now the motives that for the mo&s;t part incite Gentlemen to &s;tudy are two, Plea&s;ure and Vanity. But Plea&s;ure and Vanity will find their account abundantly more in polite Learning, than in Literature, which is bare|ly &s;olid. For, polite Learning is more ea&s;ie, and has more of Imagination in it, and in|&s;tructs them much better how to varni&s;h their defects, and render them agreeable to one another. 'Tis chiefly then the polite Learn|ing of any Nation that engages the Gentle|men of foreign Countries to apply them&s;elves to &s;tudy the Language of that Nation. But even of polite Learning, Poetry appears to be the mo&s;t agreeable, and mo&s;t attractive branch, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t moving. And we find by experience, that in the Learning of tho&s;e Languages which have been mo&s;t generally known, Poetry has made a very con&s;iderable figure. Gentlemen then in all
<PB REF="24">
likelihood will apply them&s;elves mo&s;t eager|ly to the &s;tudy of that Language, who&s;e Poetry is very agreeable to them. But that Poetry mu&s;t be mo&s;t agreeable to the generality of Gentlemen which is mo&s;t moving and mo&s;t in&s;tructive. For, tho Gentlemen &s;tudy to plea&s;e them&s;elves, yet if they are men of &s;en&s;e, they will not be for empty plea&s;ure, but will endeavour to be in&s;tructed and de|lighted together. Be&s;ides, when Gentle|men begin to &s;tudy the Poetry of any lan|guage, the fir&s;t thing they under&s;tand is the rea&s;onable part of it. For the finene&s;s of the Imaginative part, which depends in great mea&s;ure upon force of words, and up|on the beauty of expre&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t lye con|ceal'd from them in a good degree till they are perfect in the Language. Thus the Poe|try of that Language which is mo&s;t rea&s;ona|ble and mo&s;t in&s;tructive, mu&s;t in all likeli|hood have mo&s;t attraction for the Gentle|men of neighbouring Nations; and we have &s;hewn above, that that is the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and mo&s;t in&s;tructive Poetry, which is the mo&s;t Regular.</P>
<P>My Lord, upon this foot it is ea&s;ie to de|termine whether our Poetry or the <HI>French</HI> has mo&s;t attractions for the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> This is plain, that <HI>Moliere, Corneille</HI> and <HI>Racine</HI> and <HI>Boileau</HI> are known in a manner
<PB REF="25">
to all the Chri&s;tian World; whereas <HI>Spen|cer</HI> and <HI>Milton, Ben John&s;on</HI> and <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> are &s;trangers as it were to all the world, excepting the Subjects of <HI>Great Bri|tain.</HI> I believe that our Language, by rea|&s;on of the dependance that it has upon the <HI>Saxon,</HI> is not very difficult to be learnt by the people of the Northern Countries; and in &s;hort, many of their Clergy have learnt enough of it, to make their advantage of our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Writings. But both they and their Gentlemen are almo&s;t wholly &s;trangers to our Poetry, whereas the <HI>French</HI> Poets are extremely well known to the&punc; But here &s;ome angry people will immediate|ly ask if I affirm that our own is inferiour to the <HI>French</HI> Poetry. To &s;atisfie both them and the Truth, I am oblig'd to declare; at the &s;ame time &s;ubmitting this matter to be decided by your Lord&s;hip in the la&s;t appeal, that I believe we have naturally more force, and more elevation than the <HI>French</HI>; that &s;everal things in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> are &s;uperiour to any which the <HI>French</HI> Theatre has pro|duc'd; and that in &s;ome little Poems, which either requir'd no &s;ymetry, or were writ by tho&s;e who very well knew how to practi&s;e it, we are ab&s;olutely &s;uperiour to them; that at la&s;t I am not &s;o much de|livering my own thoughts, as the opinions
<PB REF="26">
of others; that the very de&s;ign I have even in affirming what I do, is to do what lies in my little capacity to put our Writers in a way to make our Neighbours, and with them all <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of the advantage which we have by Nature? that even our natural force mu&s;t receive acce&s;&s;ion from Art, and augment in proportion as the <HI>French</HI> has done; that both our Force and our Spirit will in all likelihood be augmented by Skill, as addre&s;s in the u&s;e of our Weapons very often adds both to our Force and Courage. That a Poem with a Fable is like a Human Body, and that the weakne&s;s of any one part, influences and di&s;ables in &s;ome degree tho&s;e which in them&s;elves are &s;trong; that if we are not &s;hock'd at our own Irregulari|ty, 'tis becau&s;e it has the advantage of long Habitude, for we have been us'd to it from our Infancy; but that to our Neighbours, who have con&s;tantly been us'd to Art and Conduct, it mu&s;t &s;eem as awkward and as di&s;agreeable, as our <HI>Gothick</HI> Cathedrals would to tho&s;e <HI>Italians</HI> who have always frequented St <HI>Peter</HI>'s; and that what I barely call Irregular here, would be term'd by them Indecent, Immoral, Unju&s;t, Un|rea&s;onable, Unnatural. In fine, I appeal to your Lord&s;hip, whether the <HI>French</HI> Dra|matick Writers are not believ'd &s;uperiour to

the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI>; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> at the &s;ame time I am convinc'd, that our Writers having naturally more elevation, and our Language more Harmony than theirs and both our Writers and Language more force; we want only Art to make our&s;elves as &s;uperiour to them in Poetry as we formerly were in Empire.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, I fancy that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the enemies to Regularity in a little confu+&s;ion; they are too well &s;atisfied of you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord&s;hips Ability and Impartiality, to de+cline your Juri&s;diction; and they cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> but remember to their &s;orrow that you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> formerly given the Cau&s;e again&s;t them.</P>

the actual preheminence of the An|cients, have fondly believ'd that they were &s;uperiour to us by Nature; and that others, as <HI>Perrault,</HI> very ju&s;tly di&s;daining to own &s;uch a natural &s;uperiority, have very unju&s;t|ly deny'd their actual preheminence. The fir&s;t part of the following Treati&s;e was in|tended to &s;hew, that the Ancient Poets had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">at actual preheminence, but that they de|riv'd it from joyning their Religion with their Poetry; upon which I believe they were thrown at fir&s;t by chance. The De&s;ign of the &s;econd part is to &s;hew, that the Mo|derns, by incorporating Poetry with the Religion reveal'd to us in Sacred Writ, may come to equal the Ancients. But two things mu&s;t be always &s;uppos'd: the one, That the Poets have force and skill equal to the &s;ubjects they treat of; and a &s;acred &s;ubject requires ten times more of both than a prophane one. The other is, That this is not to be extended to tho&s;e &s;orts of Poetry, in which the Moderns cannot po&s;&s;ibly make u&s;e of their Religion, with the &s;ame advantage that the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> employ'd theirs, as Epic, Pa&s;toral and Amorous Poetry.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The De&s;ign of the Work.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing can &s;hew the excellence of Poetry more, than that it has always been e&s;teem'd by the be&s;t of men, and that there has been no extraordinary man in
<PB N="2" REF="32">
the world &s;ince it came to any perfecti|on, but who has commended it or en|courag'd it.</P>
<P>And yet, to the Confu&s;ion of mo&s;t who have given them&s;elves time to think of it, Poetry, that has been en|courag'd by &s;o many great Princes, is believ'd by &s;everal to have degenerated, rather than to have improv'd by Time; while Phy&s;icks, Metaphy&s;icks, and &s;ome other Arts, that have been very little, or not at all encourag'd, have advanc'd con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>And what will appear to be yet more &s;trange, the very efforts that the Mo|derns have made to advance Poetry have done it hurt, becau&s;e they have proceeded upon &s;uch erroneous princi|ples, as have not only made their at|tempts &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s, but have caus'd them to mi&s;take their Errors for their Impo|tence.</P>
<P>For, &s;ome of the Moderns, who have been great Admirers of their Contem|poraries, which is a mode&s;t expre&s;&s;ion for them&s;elves, will by no means allow that the Ancients have excell'd us. From which opinion Pre&s;umption has fol|low'd, and from Pre&s;umption Security, and from Security Idlene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="33">
But De&s;pair on the other &s;ide has done a great deal more harm than Pre|&s;umption has done on that. For &s;ome who have been of opinion that the An|cients have &s;urpa&s;s'd us, have believ'd that they have done &s;o, becau&s;e they were in them&s;elves &s;uperiour to us; from which it has happen'd that they have been &s;ervilely contented with following their old Ma&s;ters, and mo&s;t of the Be&s;t of the Modern Poetry has been but a Copy of the Ancient.</P>
<P>The&s;e different Opinions have occa|&s;ion'd Di&s;putes, and the&s;e Di&s;putes have produc'd Quarrels, which have been maintain'd with a great deal of Heat on both &s;ides. The favourers of the Mo|derns have treated their Adver&s;aries as dejected little-&s;oul'd per&s;ons, who have a ba&s;e opinion of them&s;elves and of Human Nature, which la&s;t they have much ado to forgive them, becau&s;e they are included in the Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>For, How can it be, &s;ay they, but a Scandalous De&s;pondence that obliges us to prefer other men to our &s;elves, when Rea&s;on gives us the preference. For this, they &s;ay, is pa&s;t all Di&s;pute, that they who excel others in the &s;ame kinds
<PB N="4" REF="34">
of Writing, mu&s;t have &s;ome advantage over them. And that advantage mu&s;t be either from without or from within, or from the &s;ubjects they treat of. Now we can make it appear, &s;ay the Favour|ers of the Moderns, that the Ancient Poets had no external or internal ad|vantage over us, and that the advan|tage of the &s;ubject is rather on our &s;ide. And this is what the Favourers of the Moderns alledge for them&s;elves. The Partizans of the Ancients have on the other &s;ide treated the Favourers of the Moderns, as per&s;ons that are ab&s;olutely ignorant and without ta&s;te.</P>
<P>That the Ancients have excelled us in the greatne&s;s of Poetry they pretend to prove from the Authority of all; who have univer&s;ally been acknowledged to to be the be&s;t Judges. For, &s;ay they, the con&s;ent of the&s;e, where the que&s;tion is concerning a thing, that is rather to be felt, than to be demon&s;trated, is of the la&s;t importance. We defy, &s;ay they, any of the Favourers of the Moderns, to name &s;o much as one Modern Critick, who has any Reputation in the world, who does not acknowledge that the An|cients &s;urpa&s;s us in the greatne&s;s of Poe|try.
<PB N="5" REF="35">
For the few, &s;ay they, who have a&s;&s;erted the preheminence of the Mo|derns, have immediately rendred them|&s;elves ridiculous to all men, who have any under&s;tanding in the&s;e affairs, and at length to all the re&s;t, excepting a little handful of men, who&s;e arrogance and ob&s;tinacy and extravagant vanity has been a Comedy to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>So that the con&s;ent of the be&s;t Cri|ticks, continue they, implies the con|&s;ent of all, and the con&s;ent of man|kind for &s;o many &s;everal ages, con|cerning a thing that is rather to be felt, than to be demon&s;trated, is, if not a convincing Proof, at lea&s;t a very &s;trong Pre&s;umption. But what has been the event of this Di&s;pute on both &s;ides? Why the probability of the Arguments, in&s;tead of working conviction, has only exa&s;perated the Spirits of the Parties; and the Favourers of the Moderns have treated the Lovers of the Ancients as &s;o many &s;lavi&s;h Pedants, and the&s;e on the other &s;ide the Favourers of the Moderns as &s;o many ignorant Fools.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t this diver&s;ity of opinions and the&s;e contentious ferments, I thought I &s;hould do an important &s;ervice to a mo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="36">
noble art, if I could contribute any thing to the reconciling the common Friends to Poetry, that they might en|deavour the advancement of the com|mon cau&s;e with greater force united.</P>
<P>In order then to the calming the Fu|ry of the Contending Parties, I &s;hall endeavour to extort Important Conce&s;&s;i|ons from both, and oblige on the one &s;ide, the Favourers of the Moderns, to acknowledge that the Ancients are not &s;o weak as to make the Moderns pre|&s;ume; and engage at the &s;ame time the Parti&s;ans of the Ancients to own, that the Ancients are not in them&s;elves &s;o &s;trong, as to make the Moderns de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>And in order to the gaining this point with the greater ea&s;e, and the making my &s;elf an Agreeable Mediator of Peace, I &s;hall endeavour to make an Impartial enquiry into the merits of the Cau&s;e, and try to engage both Parties by turns, by &s;upporting their ju&s;t preten|&s;ions. And whereas the Favourers of the Moderns have ju&s;tly alledged, that all Writers who &s;urpa&s;s others in the &s;ame kinds of Writings, mu&s;t do it from &s;ome nternal, or external advantage, or from
<PB N="7" REF="37">
the &s;ubject it &s;elf, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew in the two following Chapters, that the Ancients could not derive their preheminence from any external or in|ternal advantage, and afterwards we &s;hall proceed to examine whether they deriv'd it from the &s;ubjects they treated of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. That the Ancients did not excel the Moderns by any External Ad|vantage.</HEAD>
<P>THe External Advantages which one Writer has over another are chiefly two. The A&s;&s;i&s;tance which he receives from the Age in which he writes, and the Encouragement he meets with. Now we &s;hall &s;hew that the Ancients did not &s;urpa&s;s the Moderns on the account of either of the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they had no advantage in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which they receiv'd from the Age in which they writ; on the con|trary,
<PB N="8" REF="38">
the advantage here is clearly on the &s;ide of the Moderns: For good Thinking is the foundation of good Wri|ting, both in Eloquence and in Poetry. Now thoughts are but the Images of things, and our knowledge of things is greater than that of the Ancients. For &s;everal which they knew are better known to us, and we know &s;everal which they never knew at all. How many Arts have the Moderns im|prov'd? How many wonderful Inven|tions are owing to them? And how many amazing Di&s;coveries? From which we have a &s;upply of Thoughts and Images that is never to be exhau&s;t|ed. So that in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which we Receive from the Age in which we live, we have the advantage of the An|cients.</P>
<P>Nor, &s;econdly, is it from the encou|ragement which they received, that the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns: Tho at the &s;ame time I really believe that En|couragement was one of the cau&s;es of the Ancient excellence of the Orators. For tho good Thinking is the foundation of good Writing both in Eloquence and in Poetry, and the Moderns are quali|fy'd
<PB N="9" REF="39">
to think as Rea&s;onably and as Sub|tly as the Ancients thought, yet 'tis in the&s;e Arts as it is in Architecture, there can be no Beauty nor Greatne&s;s without Foundation, but 'tis not the Foundation that makes the Greatne&s;s or Beauty. The chief de&s;ign of Eloquence is to per|&s;wade, and he per&s;wading the mo&s;t effectually who moves his Hearers the mo&s;t; that which makes the Greatne&s;s and Beauty of Eloquence, is not &s;o much the thinking rightly, tho without that there can be no Excellence, as tho&s;e violent Pa&s;&s;ions that reign and tyran|nize over our Souls in the Speeches of the Ancient Orators, which they chiefly deriv'd from Ambition. For the mov|ing their Popular A&s;&s;emblies among the Ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> being almo&s;t the only way among them to arrive at the chief Honours of the State, it can be no wonder to tho&s;e who re|flect upon the Force of Ambition, and the Stings it infixes into the minds of men, that the Ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> &s;hould be &s;o great Ma&s;ters of Eloquence. For, being in&s;tigated and &s;tung by Ambition, they not only were &s;upported in the taking &s;uch pains as the
<PB N="10" REF="40">
Moderns are utterly uncapable of taking, becau&s;e they have not the &s;ame incen|tive to &s;u&s;tain them, but being mov'd and fir'd by Ambition them&s;elves they the more ea&s;ily rowz'd and inflam'd others; for if any one happens to urge, that the Love of Glory being alike in|&s;eparable from Moderns and Ancients, they have equal incentives to Elo|quence; I de&s;ire him to take notice, that there is a very con&s;iderable difference between the Love of Glory barely con|&s;idered, and that which is joyn'd to Ambition, which is the de&s;ire of Pow|er and Place. For I de&s;ire him to con|&s;ider, what Nouri&s;hment and Force the Love of Glory that was in the minds of the Ancient Orators, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have received from the Tumultuous ap|plau&s;es of the popular A&s;&s;emblies, and the Glorious Recompences that en&s;ued upon them.</P>
<P>But now if any one thinks, that he has here found out the Rea&s;on, why the Ancients &s;urpa&s;s'd us in the greater Poetry, becau&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion making the Greatne&s;s and Beauty of Poetry, as well as it does of Eloquence, (which it cer|tainly does, as &s;hall be clearly &s;hewn
<PB N="11" REF="41">
anon) and Pa&s;&s;ion receiving acce&s;s from Encouragement, the Ancient Poets writ with a Force &s;uperiour to that of the Moderns, only becau&s;e they were more encouraged: if any one, I &s;ay, thinks at this rate, he will find him&s;elf very much mi&s;taken. For tho I am con|vinc'd that Encouragement does very much, yet I am &s;atisfied that the diffe|rence is not chiefly owing to that; for in the fir&s;t place, tho the encourage|ment which the Ancients gave, was more general than that which the Mo|derns have met with, yet &s;ome of the Moderns have been as much encourag'd as mo&s;t of the Ancients were, and yet fall very much &s;hort of them in the greater Poetry, of which <HI>Boileau</HI> and <HI>Racine</HI> are two Illu&s;trious Examples. In the &s;econd place, <HI>Homer,</HI> the mo&s;t ad|mirable of all the Ancients, was not at all encourag'd. In the third place, one of the Moderns receiv'd no encourage|ment, who has often tran&s;cendently &s;oar'd above both Ancients and Mo|derns, and that is <HI>Milton,</HI> as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its proper place. And, la&s;tly, Comedy was as much encourag'd by the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> as any other
<PB N="12" REF="42">
&s;ort of Poetry; witne&s;s what the <HI>Athe|nians</HI> did for <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius</HI> for <HI>Terence</HI>; and yet I am per&s;waded that the Moderns have &s;ur|pa&s;s'd the Ancients in Comedy, and &s;hall give my Rea&s;ons below why I make no &s;cruple of preferring <HI>Moliere,</HI> and two or three of our own Comick Poets, to <HI>Terence</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tophanes.</HI> So that we mu&s;t &s;eek for another Cau&s;e of the ex|cellence of the Ancient Poets, than the encouragement they met with.</P>
<P>There are three other things which may be numbred among external advan|tages, and tho&s;e are the Climates in which the Ancient Poets liv'd, and the Languages in which they writ, and the Liberty which they enjoy'd. But the&s;e are not the chief things from which the Ancients deriv'd their Preheminence. For the greate&s;t of the <HI>Lyrick</HI> Poets writ in a Country of downright Blockheads, and one of the greate&s;t of the <HI>Epick</HI> Po|ets in a Country that had lo&s;t its Liber|ty, and be&s;ides the <HI>Grecians</HI> enjoy'd all the advantages of their Climate, and their Language and their Liberty, long after the Decay of Poetry. 'Tis true, indeed, the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> did
<PB N="13" REF="43">
derive one real Excellence from the Beauty of their Language, and that was the Harmony of their Ver&s;ification, in which the Moderns are not likely to e|qual them. But Harmony of Ver&s;ificati|on is not the chief thing in Poetry, nor does the chief Excellence of the Anci|ents con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a Harmony. And thus we have &s;hewn that they did not derive their Preheminence from any thing that was external: Let us exa|mine in the next Chapter, whether the Ancients deriv'd their Excellence from any internal advantage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. That the Ancients did not &s;urpa&s;s the Moderns from any Internal Advantage.</HEAD>
<P>THere is nothing more certain, than that he who handles any &s;ubject excellently, mu&s;t do it by the power of his Internal Faculties. And con&s;equent|ly he who treats any &s;ubject admirably,
<PB N="14" REF="44">
has an inward advantage over him who treats it &s;curvily. But either that ad|vantage is naturally deriv'd from the &s;ubject, or it is not. If it is naturally deriv'd from the &s;ubject, in that ca&s;e we can never pretend to deny that the Ancients had an inward advantage over the Moderns. All that we &s;hall endea|vour to prove, is, that they had no in|ternal advantage over them, ab&s;tracted from the nature of the &s;ubjects of which they treated.</P>
<P>Now all the internal advantages, which the Ancients may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had over the Moderns, may be reduc'd to four. Divine In&s;piration. In&s;piration by Daemons. A Natural Superiority of the Faculties of the Soul. A greater Degree of Vertue.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t advantage that the Ancient Poets may be &s;uppo&s;'d to have had o|ver the Moderns, is from Divine In&s;pi|ration. Now the Ancient Poets were the Heathen Theologues, and to affirm that the Spirit of God &s;hould in&s;pire tho&s;e to teach the Adoration of Idols, and in&s;pire them more than he does the Moderns, who are of the true Religion, would be equally ab&s;urd and bla&s;phe|mous.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="45">
Nor, Secondly, can they have any advantage by In&s;piration of Daemons. For in the fir&s;t place, 'tis ab&s;urd to give a &s;upernatural Cau&s;e of an effect of which we can give a very natural one. But we can give a very natural Cau&s;e of the Excellence of the Ancient Poets, as &s;hall be &s;hewn anon. In the &s;econd place the Ancients before <HI>Socrates,</HI> ow'd all their Moral Philo&s;ophy to their Po|ets. Now tho that Philo&s;ophy was only di&s;pers'd up and down in &s;en|tences, yet had it a natural tendency to the forming that &s;y&s;tem, which after|wards the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Socrates</HI> fram'd from the mouth of their Ma&s;ter. And as that &s;y&s;tem was the utter overthrow of the Heathen Revelation, as we &s;hall &s;hew anon, any thing that had a natu|ral tendency to the forming that &s;y&s;tem, could not be the work of Daemons. But Thirdly, &s;uppo&s;ing the Ancient <HI>Graecian</HI> Poets were really in&s;pired by Daemons, it is hard to imagine that they &s;hould receive a greater advantage from &s;uch an In&s;piration as that, than the Moderns, who apply them&s;elves to Sacred Poetry, &s;hould have from Di|vine A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="46">
Nor, Thirdly, Can the Ancient Po+ets be &s;uppos'd to have had a greater &s;hare of virtue than the Moderns. For all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets who were famous for the greater Poetry, flouri&s;h'd before there was in that part of the world any &s;y&s;tem of Morality. And perhaps mo&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poetry is only a Copy of the <HI>Grecian.</HI> Now it is hard to ima|gin, that they who had no &s;y&s;tem of Morality, and no &s;upernatural &s;upport, &s;hould tran&s;cend the Moderns in Vertue, who have a perfect &s;y&s;tem of Morality and Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nor, Fourthly, and principally, had the Ancient any natural &s;uperiority of Faculties over the Modern Poets. For if they &s;urpa&s;s the Moderns in the great|er Poetry, out of any &s;uperiority of Fa|culties, which they had naturally as they were the Ancients, it mu&s;t be by a &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding or imagi|nation, or both. But fir&s;t, it was not from any &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding. Becau&s;e from hence it would follow, that the Minds of men grow weaker by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, and then the Ancients would have &s;urpa&s;s'd one ano|ther, as they preceded in time.<PB N="17" REF="47">
<HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;aeus</HI> would have excell'd <HI>Homer, Alcaeus</HI> and <HI>Stetichorus Pindar, The&s;pis Euripides,</HI> and <HI>Ae&s;chylus Sopho|cles</HI>; <HI>Tyrtaeus Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Alcmon Horace,</HI> which is all ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. But then again, if any one urges, that if the An|cients did not &s;urpa&s;s one another ac|cording to precedence of time, it was becau&s;e art and experience were requir'd to the perfection of Poetry, and the younger in Time had the Advantage of the elder both in Art and Experience; to that I an&s;wer, that &s;ome of the Po|ets, who are younger in Time, have perhaps the advantage of tho&s;e who are older, more by Nature than they have by Art. For the Tragick and Lyrick Poets, who preceded <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Pin|dar,</HI> come more behind them in true Genius than they go before them in Time. But now if the Ancients did not &s;urpa&s;s one another according to priority of Time, why &s;hould they ex|cel us? If it be objected, that &s;everal very extraordinary men happen'd to be born at &s;uch and &s;uch particular times; to that I an&s;wer, that this arriv'd by providence or by chance. If you al|ledge that it fell out by chance, to that
<PB N="18" REF="48">
I reply, that all the great Poets among the <HI>Grecians</HI> flouri&s;h'd within four hun|dred years of one another, and all the great Poets among the <HI>Romans</HI> within two hundred years; and then let me ask you, whither this look'd like chance. But if you pretend, that the&s;e men at the&s;e particular times, were de&s;ign'd &s;uch excellent Poets by Providence, and for that very end were form'd with fa|culties &s;o much &s;uperiour to tho&s;e who preceded them, and who came after them; then let me ask you, for what de&s;ign Providence &s;hould &s;o manife&s;tly alter the cour&s;e of nature, or why that which fell out by Providence then, may not by Providence arrive again.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns by a &s;uperiority of under|&s;tanding, it would nece&s;&s;arily follow that they under&s;tood their Subjects bet|ter; which is fal&s;e: For the Subjects of the Epick, Tragick and Lyrick Poets, are the vertues, vices, and pa&s;&s;ions of men, which the Moderns ought to un|der&s;tand at lea&s;t as well as the Ancients, becau&s;e they have all the knowledge of the Ancients, and their own improve|ment be&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="49">
Thus have I endeavour'd to &s;how, that we have no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of equalling the Ancients, becau&s;e of the Tran&s;cendency of their under&s;tandings. And what has been &s;aid about their un|der&s;tandings, may &s;erve to &s;hew that they as little excell'd the Moderns in their Imaginations, as they did in the other; tho &s;omething more may be &s;aid for the la&s;t, for the violence of the Pa&s;|&s;ions, proceeding from the force of the Imagination, and the corruption of Mankind, from the violence of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and the corruption of Man|kind growing greater, as the World grows older; it follows, that the Ima|ginations of Men mu&s;t grow &s;tronger as the World grows older.</P>
<P>But la&s;tly, how vain it is to urge, that the Ancients excell'd the Moderns by a &s;uperiority of Faculties, when it will appear a little lower, as clear as the Sun, that one of the Moderns very of|ten excells them both in his Thoughts and Spirit.</P>
<P>Thus we have endeavour'd to &s;hew, that the Ancients did not excell the Mo|derns in the greater Poetry, from any external advantage, that is, from the
<PB N="20" REF="50">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they had, from the Ages in which they writ, or from the Encouragement with which they met. We have &s;hewn too, that they did not &s;urpa&s;s them from any Internal advan|tage, whether it was from Divine In|&s;piration, or In&s;piration by Daemons, or Tran&s;cendency of Vertue, or &s;uperi|ority of Faculties. The advantage then, which the Ancient Poets had o|ver the Moderns, if they had any ad|vantage, mu&s;t be deriv'd from the Sub|jects of which they treated.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. That the Ancient Poets deriv'd their greatne&s;s from the Nature of their Subjects.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Ancient Poets excell'd the Mo|derns in the greatne&s;s of Poetry; that is, in Epick Poetry, in Tragedy, and in the greater Ode; they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily derive their preheminence from the Sub|jects of which they treated, &s;ince it has
<PB N="21" REF="51">
beeu plainly made to appear, that they could notDerive it from anyExternal or Internal advantage. And it follows, that the Subjects which were handled by the Ancients, mu&s;t be different from tho&s;e which have been treated of by the Mo|derns. And if the Poems which have been writ by the Ancients of the foremen|tioned kinds were very much greater than tho&s;e which have been produced by the Moderns, why then it follows, that the &s;ubjects were very different. But here the Favourers of the Moderns a&s;|&s;ert, that the advantage which is to be drawn from the Subject, is purely on the &s;ide of the Moderns. For who, for Example, will compare the atchieve|ments of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Aeneas,</HI> the event of which was only the reducing two pitiful paltry Bourgs, with the glorious actions of &s;ome of our Modern Cap|tains. But then the Partizans of the An|cients reply, that there is a difference between one &s;ubject and another, which their adver&s;aries &s;eem not to have thought of. For, &s;ay they, humane Sub|jects, can never differ &s;o much among them&s;elves, as Sacred Subjects differ from Humane, for the difference
<PB N="22" REF="52">
between the Two la&s;t is as great as that between God and Man; which we know is infinite. Now, &s;ay they, &s;acred Subjects are infinitely more &s;u&s;ceptible of the greatne&s;s of Poetry, than prophane ones can be. And the Subjects of the Ancients in the foremen|tioned Poems were &s;acred. Now that we may engage the Lovers of the Anti|ents in their turns by &s;upporting their ju&s;t preten&s;ions, let us endeavour to &s;how in the following Chapters, that Sacred Poems mu&s;t be greater than Pro|phane ones can be, &s;uppo&s;ing equality of Genius, and equal art in the Writers, and that the Poems of the Ancients in the forementioned kinds were &s;acred. But in order to the doing that, we mu&s;t declare what Poety is, and what is its chief Excellence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="23" REF="53">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Pa&s;&s;ion is the chief thing in in Poetry, and that all Pa&s;&s;ion is either ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, or En|thu&s;ia&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>But before we proceed let us define Poetry; which is the fir&s;t time that a Definition has been given of that no|ble Art: For neither Ancient nor Mo|dern Criticks have defin'd Poetry in ge|neral.</P>
<P>Poetry then is an imitation of Nature by a pathetick and numerous Speech. Let us explain it.</P>
<P>As Poetry is an Art, it mu&s;t be an Imi|tation of Nature. That the in&s;trument with which it makes its Imitation is Speech need not be di&s;puted. That that Speech, mu&s;t be Mu&s;ical, no one can doubt: For Numbers di&s;tingui&s;h the parts of Poetick Diction from the peri|ods of Pro&s;e. Now Numbers are no|thing but articulate &s;ounds, and their
<PB N="24" REF="54">
pau&s;es mea&s;ur'd by their proper propor|tions of time. And the periods of Pro|&s;aick Diction are articulate &s;ounds, and their pau&s;es unmea&s;ur'd by &s;uch propor|tions. That the Speech, by which Poe|try makes its Imitation, mu&s;t be pathetick is evident; for Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to it than Harmony. For Harmony only di&s;tingui&s;hes its In&s;tru|ment from that of Pro&s;e, but Pa&s;&s;ion di&s;tingui&s;hes its very nature and cha|racter. For therefore Poetry is Poetry, becau&s;e it is more pa&s;&s;ionate and &s;en&s;ual than Pro&s;e. A Di&s;cour&s;e that is writ in very good Numbers, if it wants Pa&s;|&s;ion can be but mea&s;ur'd Pro&s;e. But a Di&s;cour&s;e that is every where extremely pathetick, and con&s;equently every where bold and figurative, is certainly Poetry without Numbers.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion then is the Characteri&s;tical mark of Poetry, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be every where. For where-ever a Di&s;|cour&s;e is not pathetick, there it is Pro|&s;aick. As Pa&s;&s;ion in a Poem mu&s;t be every where, &s;o Harmony is u&s;ually dif|fus'd throughout it. But Pa&s;&s;ion an&s;wers the two ends of Poetry better than Har|mony can do, and upon that account is
<PB N="25" REF="55">
preferable to it: For fir&s;t it plea&s;es more, which is evident: For Pa&s;&s;ion can plea&s;e without Harmony, but Harmony tires without Pa&s;&s;ion. And in Tragedy and in Epick Poetry a man may in&s;truct without Harmony, but never without Pa&s;&s;ion: For the one in&s;tructs by Ad|miration, and the other by Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror. And as for the greater Ode, if it wants Pa&s;&s;ion, it becomes Hateful and Intolerable, and its Sen|tences grow Contemptible.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion is the Characteri&s;tical mark of Poetry, and therefore it mu&s;t be every where; for without Pa&s;&s;ion there can be no Poetry, no more than there can be Painting. And tho the Poet and the Painter de&s;cribe action, they mu&s;t de|&s;cribe it with Pa&s;&s;ion. Let any one who beholds a piece of Painting, where the Figures are &s;hewn in action, con|clude that if the Figures are without Pa&s;&s;ion the Painting is contemptible. There mu&s;t be Pa&s;&s;ion every where in Poetry and Painting, and the more Pa&s;|&s;ion there is, the better the Poetry and the Painting, unle&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ion is too much for the &s;ubject; and the Painter and the Poet arrive at the height of
<PB N="26" REF="56">
their Art, when they de&s;cribe a great deal of Action with a great deal of Pa&s;|&s;ion. It is plain then from what has been &s;aid, that Pa&s;&s;ion in Poetry mu&s;t be every where, for where there is no Pa&s;&s;ion there can be no Poetry, but that which we commonly call Pa&s;&s;ion, can|not be every where in any Poem. There mu&s;t be Pa&s;&s;ion then, that mu&s;t be di|&s;tinct from ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, and that mu&s;t be Enthu&s;ia&s;m. I call that ordina|ry Pa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e cau&s;e is clearly com|prehended by him who feels it, whether it be Admiration, Terror or Joy; and I call the very &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, when their cau&s;e is not clearly compre|hended by him who feels them. And tho&s;e Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ome|times &s;imple, and &s;ometimes complicated, of all which we &s;hall &s;hew examples lower. And thus I have &s;hewn that the chief thing in Poetry is Pa&s;&s;ion; but here the Reader is de&s;ir'd to ob&s;erve, that by Poetry we mean Poetry in ge|neral, and the Body of Poetry; for as for the form or &s;oul of particular Po|ems, that is allow'd by all to be a Fa|ble. But Pa&s;&s;ion is the chief thing in the Body of Poetry, as Spirit is in the
<PB N="27" REF="57">
Human Body. For without Spirit the Body langui&s;hes, and the Soul is impo|tent: Now every thing that they call Spirit or Genius in Poetry, in &s;hort, every thing that plea&s;es, and con&s;e|quently moves in the Poetick Diction, is Pa&s;&s;ion, whether it be ordinary or En|thu&s;ia&s;tick.</P>
<P>And thus we have &s;hewn what the chief excellence in the Body of Poetry is, which we have prov'd to be Pa&s;&s;ion. Let us now proceed to the proofs of what we propounded, that &s;acred &s;ub|jects are more &s;u&s;ceptible of Pa&s;&s;ion than prophane ones, and that the &s;ubjects of the Ancients were &s;acred in their greater Poetry, I mean either &s;acred in their own natures, or by their manner of handling them.</P>

Let us now proceed to convince the Reader, that a &s;acred Poem is more &s;u&s;ceptible of Pa&s;&s;ion than a prophane one can be; which to effect, let us &s;hew two things, that a &s;acred &s;ubject is as &s;u&s;ceptible of ordinary pa&s;&s;ions as a pro|phane one can be, and more &s;u&s;ceptible of the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is evident from experience: For the Poetry among the Ancients,
<PB N="29" REF="59">
which &s;hall be hereafter prov'd to be &s;acred, had in it greater ordinary Pa&s;&s;i|ons, than their Human Poetry either had or could po&s;&s;ibly have.</P>
<P>'Tis now our bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;how that Religious &s;ubjects are capable of &s;upply|ing us with more frequent and &s;tronger Enthu&s;ia&s;ms than the prophane. And in order to the clearing this, let us en|quire what Poetical Enthu&s;ia&s;m is. Poe|tical Enthu&s;ia&s;m is a Pa&s;&s;ion guided by Judgment, who&s;e cau&s;e is not compre|hended by us. That it is a Pa&s;&s;ion is plain, becau&s;e it moves. That the cau&s;e is not comprehended is &s;elf|evident. That it ought to guided by Judgment is indubitable. For otherwi&s;e it would be Madne&s;s, and not Poetical Pa&s;&s;ion. But now let us enquire what the cau&s;e of Poetical Enthu&s;ia&s;m is, that has been hitherto not comprehended by us. That Enthu&s;ia&s;m moves, is plain to &s;ence; why then it mov'd the Writer: But if it mov'd the Writer, it mov'd him while he was thinking. Now what can move a man while he is thinking, but the thoughts that are in his mind. In &s;hort, Enthu&s;ia&s;m as well as ordi|nary Pa&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t proceed from the
<PB N="30" REF="60">
thoughts, as the Pa&s;&s;ions of all rea&s;o|nable creatures mu&s;t certainly do; but the rea&s;on why we know not the cau&s;es of Enthu&s;ia&s;tick as well as of ordinary Pa&s;&s;ions, is becau&s;e we are not &s;o us'd to them, and becau&s;e they proceed from thoughts, that latently and unob&s;erv'd by us, carry Pa&s;&s;ion along with them. Here it would be no hard matter to prove that mo&s;t of our thoughts are na|turally attended with &s;ome &s;ort and &s;ome degree of Pa&s;&s;ion. And 'tis the expre&s;&s;ion of this Pa&s;&s;ion, which gives us &s;o much plea&s;ure, both in Conver&s;a|tion and in Human Authors. For I ap|peal to any man who is not altogether a Philo&s;opher, whether he is not mo&s;t pleas'd with. Conver&s;ation and Books that are Spirited. Now how can this Spirit plea&s;e him, but becau&s;e it moves him, or what can move him but Pa&s;&s;i|on? We never &s;peak for &s;o much as a minute together withont different in|flexions of voice. Now any one will find upon reflection, that the&s;e variati|ons and tho&s;e inflexions mark our diffe|rent pa&s;&s;ions. But all this pa&s;&s;es unre|garded by us, by rea&s;on of long u&s;e, and the incredible celerity of our thoughts,
<PB N="31" REF="61">
who&s;e motion is &s;o &s;wift, that it is even to our &s;elves imperceptible; unle&s;s we come to reflect, and every one will not be at the trouble of that. Now the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, when they grow &s;trong I call Enthu&s;ia&s;tick motions, and the &s;tronger they are the greater the Enthu&s;ia&s;m mu&s;t be. If any one asks what &s;ort of pa&s;&s;i|ons the&s;e are, that thus unknown to us flow from the&s;e thoughts; to him I an|&s;wer, that the &s;ame &s;ort of pa&s;&s;ions flow from the thoughts, that would do from the things of which tho&s;e thoughts are Ideas. As for example, if the thing that we think of is great, when then admira|tion attends the Idea of it; and if it is very great amazement. If the thing is plea&s;ing and delightful, why then Joy and Gayety flow from the Idea of it; if it is &s;ad, melancholy; if 'tis mi&s;chie|vous and powerful, then the Imagination of it is attended with Terror; And if 'tis both great and likely to do hurt and powerful, why then the thought of it is at once accompanied with Won|der, Terror and A&s;toni&s;hment. Add to all this, that the mind producing the&s;e thoughts, conceives by reflection a cer|tain Pride, and Joy and Admiration, as
<PB N="32" REF="62">
at the con&s;cious view of its own excel|lence. Now he who &s;trictly examines the Enthu&s;ia&s;m that is to be met with in the greater Poetry, will find that it is nothing but the fore-mention'd pa&s;&s;i|ons, either &s;imple or complicated, pro|ceeding from the thoughts from which they naturally flow, as being the thoughts or Images of things that carry tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions along with them, as we &s;hall &s;hew by examples in the following Chapter.</P>
<P>But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that attend upon our thoughts are &s;eldom &s;o &s;trong, as they are in tho&s;e kind of thoughts which we call Images. For they being the ve|ry lively pictures of the things which they repre&s;ent, &s;et them, as it were, be|fore our very eyes. But Images are ne+ver &s;o admirably drawn, as when they are drawn in motion; e&s;pecially if the motion is violent. For the mind can never imagine violent motion, without being in a violent agitation it &s;elf; and the Imagination being fir'd with that Agitation, &s;ets the very things before our eyes; and con&s;equently makes us have the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions that we &s;hould have from the things them&s;elves. For the warmer the Imagination is, the more
<PB N="33" REF="63">
pre&s;ent the things are to us, of which we draw the Images, and therefore when once the Imagination is &s;o inflam'd as to get the better of the under&s;tanding, there is no difference between the Images and the things them&s;elves; as we &s;ee, for example, in Fevers and Mad men.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;hewn that Enthu&s;ia&s;m flows from the thoughts, and con&s;e|quently from the &s;ubject from which the thoughts proceed. For, as the Spi|rit in Poetry is to be proportion'd to the Thought, for otherwi&s;e it does not na|turally flow from it, and con&s;equently is not guided by Judgment; &s;o the Thought is to be proportion'd to the Subject. Now no Subject is &s;o capable of &s;upplying us with thoughts, that ne|ce&s;&s;arily produce the&s;e great and &s;trong Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, as a Religious Subject: For all which is great in Religion is mo&s;t exalted and amazing, all that is joyful is tran&s;porting, all that is &s;ad is di&s;mal, and all that is terrible is a&s;to|ni&s;hing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Cau&s;es of Poetical Enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;hewn by Examples.</HEAD>
<P>THe Enthu&s;ia&s;m that is found in Poetry, is nothing but the fore|mentioned pa&s;&s;ions, Admiration, Joy, Terror, A&s;toni&s;hment, flowing from the thoughts which naturally produce them. For Admiration, together with that Pride which exalts the &s;oul at the con|ceiving a great Hint, gives elevation; Joy, if 'tis great, gives tran&s;port, and a&s;toni&s;hment gives vehemence. But now let us &s;hew by examples, how this was done, and let us begin with that Admi|rable Ode of <HI>Horace,</HI> which is the third of the Third Book.</P>
<Q><L>Ju&s;tum &amp; Tenacem propo&s;iti virum,</L>
<L>Non civium ardor prava Jubentium,</L>
<L>Non vultus in&s;tantis Tyranni</L>
<L>Mente quatit &s;olida, neque Au&s;ter</L>
<L>Dux Inquieti Turbidus Adriae;</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="65">
Nec fulmin antis magna Jovis manus,</L>
<L>Se fractus Illabatur Orbis</L>
<L>Impavidum ferient Ruinae. </L></Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<P><HI>The man, the brave man, who is re|&s;olv'd upon a right and a firm principle, is &s;ure never to have his &s;olid vertue &s;haken, neither by the rage of the giddy multitude, nor by the frowns of an in|&s;ulting Tyrant, nor by the Fury of the Roaring South, that Turbulent Ruler of the Tempe&s;tuous</HI> Adria; <HI>no, nor by the Red Right Hand of Thundring</HI> Jove: <HI>Nay, &s;hould the World's disjointed Frame come ru&s;hing down with a Di&s;|mal Sound upon him, its Ruines might Cru&s;h, but they could never Shake him.</HI> Now 'tis plain that in the original there is a great deal of Enthu&s;ia&s;m. But let us ob&s;erve a little what this Enthu&s;ia&s;m is. Upon ob&s;ervation we &s;hall find then, that in the fore-mentioned Ver&s;es there is Elevation, Severity and Vehemence, and con&s;equently there is &s;omething Admirable in them, and Terrible and A&s;toni&s;hing. Now why &s;hould we feel the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in reading the&s;e thoughts, unle&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions naturally attend them, when they are expre&s;s'd as
<PB N="36" REF="66">
they &s;hould be? But Admiration, as we have &s;aid above, mu&s;t come from &s;ome|thing that is great, and Terror from &s;omething that is powerful, and likely to hurt; and A&s;toni&s;hment from &s;ome|thing that is very Terrible, and very likely to hurt; that is, from things that are &s;o, or from their Idea's. The Rea|der, upon examining the fore-mention'd Ver&s;es, will find that the thoughts in them all are great and terrible, and &s;ome of them are a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>But here I de&s;ire the Reader to ob|&s;erve three things: Fir&s;t, the admirable gradation of Thought here. How the Poet ri&s;es from &s;omething that is Terri|ble, to &s;omething that is more Terrible, till he comes at la&s;t to &s;omething A&s;to|ni&s;hing and Amazing. How from the Rage of the Mad Multitude, he proceeds to the frowns of a Tyrant that &s;tands threatning by: How he ri&s;es from thence to a &s;torm at Sea, and from thence to the wrath of <HI>Jove</HI> expre&s;s'd in the dreadful Thunder, and from thence to the final di&s;mal Di&s;&s;olution of all things. The next thing that I de|&s;ire him to ob&s;erve is, How the Spirit of the Poet ri&s;es with his Thoughts, which
<PB N="37" REF="67">
is a &s;ure &s;ign, that the one is nothing but the pa&s;&s;ions that attend on the o|ther. And the third thing that the Reader is to remark is, that the Poet could not carry his Enthu&s;ia&s;m higher after the &s;econd thought, without hav|ing recour&s;e to Religion. For he who knows any thing of the Pagan &s;y&s;tem, knows that the three la&s;t thoughts are taken from their Religion.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;et before the Reader an Image, that only by its greatne&s;s will move him and exalt him. The pa&s;&s;age is in the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradice Lo&s;t,</HI> where he thus de&s;cribes <HI>Lucifer.</HI></P>
<Q><L>He above the re&s;t,</L>
<L>In &s;hape and ge&s;ture proudly eminent,</L>
<L>Stood like a Towr, his form had yet not lo&s;t</L>
<L>All her original Brightne&s;s, nor appear'd</L>
<L>Le&s;s than Archangel ruin'd, and th' exce&s;s</L>
<L>Of Glory ob&s;cur'd, as when the Sun new ri&s;n</L>
<L>Looks thro the Horizontal mi&s;ty Air,</L>
<L>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind a Cloud&punc;</L>
<L>In dim Eclip&s;e Di&s;a&s;trous Twilight &s;heds</L>
<L>On half the Nations, and with fear of change</L>
<L>Perplexes Monarchs; Darkned &s;o yet &s;hone</L>
<L>Above them all th' Archangel, but his Face</L>
<L>Deep Scars of Thunder had Intrench'd.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="38" REF="68">
I de&s;ire the Reader would give him|&s;elf the trouble of comparing the&s;e ten lines, with the ten that preceded them, and then to tell me, why the Spirit &s;hould be &s;o much greater in the&s;e than it is in the others; unle&s;s it proceeded from the greatne&s;s of the Ideas, or how the greatne&s;s of the Ideas could cau&s;e it, but by infu&s;ing into the Poet admi|ration and a noble pride, which ex|pre&s;s'd make the Spirit, which is &s;tately and maje&s;tick till the la&s;t, and then it grows vehement, becau&s;e the Idea which cau&s;es it, is not only great, but very Terrible. For all the afflicting Pa&s;&s;ions that are violent are expre&s;s'd with ve|hemence. The Reader cannot but ob|&s;erve of him&s;elf, that the greate&s;t of the&s;e noble Ideas is taken from Reli|gion.</P>
<Q><L>But his Face</L><L>Deep Scars of Thunder had Intrench'd.</L></Q>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider two very ma&s;ter|ly Images, out of the Second Book of <HI>Virgil</HI>; the fir&s;t is the Hewing down of a Tree, which appear'd &s;o admirable to <HI>Julius Scaliger,</HI> that he affirm'd that <HI>Ju|piter</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="69">
could never have mended it; and the &s;econd gave occa&s;ion for that Incom|parable Statue of <HI>Laocoon,</HI> which I &s;aw at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Gardens of <HI>Beluidere,</HI> and which is &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that it does not appear to be the work of Art, but the mi&s;erable Creature him&s;elf, like <HI>Niobe</HI> benumm'd and petrify'd with grief and horror.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, be&s;ides its Greatne&s;s, carries Terror along with it. <HI>Virgil</HI> compares the De&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> which had been ten years be&s;ieg'd, to the fall of a Moun|tain A&s;h, at who&s;e Root the labouring Swains had been a long time hewing with their Axes.</P>

And as when &s;turdy Swains, with fre|quent &s;trokes,</L>

<L>Which long the Glory of the Mountain &s;tood,</L>
<L>That ev'ry moment formidably nods,</L>
<L>And &s;hakes the lofty glories of its crown,</L>
<L>Till broken by repeated wounds at la&s;t,</L>
<L>Down it comes ru&s;hing with a fatal groan,</L>
<L>And tears the Earth, and rends the &s;o|lid Rock,</L>
<L>And &s;till is Dreadful in its hideous fall.</L></Q>
<P>Now here I de&s;ire the Reader to con|&s;ider, how the Poet rai&s;es his Spirit as &s;oon as he &s;ets his Image in motion, and brings in Terror to his relief.</P>
<Q><L>Illa u&s;&abque; minatur,</L>

<P>Let us con&s;ider be&s;ide what prodigious force all this mu&s;t have in the connexi|on, where Religion adds to the Terror, encrea&s;es the A&s;toni&s;hment, and aug|ments the Horror. For 'twas by the di|rection of <HI>Minerva</HI> that this Terrible In|cident was brought about, who had combin'd with <HI>Juno</HI> to de&s;troy the <HI>Tro|jans,</HI> as has been at large declar'd in a former Critical Treati&s;e. And thus we have endeavour'd to &s;hew how the En|thu&s;ia&s;m proceeds from the thoughts, and con&s;equently from the &s;ubject. But one thing we have omitted, that as thoughts produce the &s;pirit, the &s;pirit produces and makes the expre&s;&s;ion; which is known by experience to all
<PB N="46" REF="76">
who are Poets; for never any one, while he was wrapt with Enthu&s;ia&s;m, wanted either Words or Harmony; and is &s;elf|evident to all who con&s;ider, that the Expre&s;&s;ion conveys and &s;hows the Spi|rit, and therefore mu&s;t be produced by it. So that from what we have &s;aid we may venture to lay down this De|finition of Poetical Genius. Poeti|cal Genius in a Poem is the true ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Ordinary or Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ion, proceeding from Ideas, to which it naturally belongs; and Poe|tical Genius in a Poet, is the power of expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion worthily: And the &s;ublime is a great thought expre&s;t with the Enthu&s;ia&s;m that belongs to it, which the Reader will find Agreeable to the Doctrine of <HI>Cecilius. Longinus,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, has not told us what the &s;ublime is; becau&s;e <HI>Cecilius,</HI> it &s;eems, had done that before him. Tho me|thinks, it was a very great fault in &s;o great a Man as <HI>Longinus,</HI> to write a Book which could not be under&s;tood, but by another Mans Writings; e&s;pe|cially when he &s;aw that tho&s;e Writings were &s;o very defective, that they were not likely to la&s;t. But tho <HI>Longinus</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="77">
does not directly tell us, what the Sub|lime is, yet in the fir&s;t &s;ix or &s;even Chapters of his Book, he takes a great deal of pains to &s;et before us, the effects which it produces in the minds of Men; as, for example, that it cau&s;es in them admiration and &s;urprize; a noble Pride, and a noble Vigour, an invincible force tran&s;porting the Soul from its ordinary Situation, and a Tran&s;port, and a ful|ne&s;s of Joy mingled with A&s;toni&s;hment. The&s;e are the effects that <HI>Longinus</HI> tells us that the Sublime produces in the minds of men. Now I have endeavour'd to &s;hew what it is in Poetry that works the&s;e effects. So that take the Cau&s;e and the Effects together, and you have the Sublime.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Recapitulation, and that the Sub|jects of the Ancients, in their greater Poetry, were Sacred.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now &s;hewn, that if the Ancients excel the Moderns in Epick Poetry, in Tragedy, and in the greater Ode, they derive not their pre|heminence from any external, nor from any internal advantage, ab&s;tracted from the nature of the &s;ubject, and that con|&s;equently they mu&s;t draw it from the nature of the &s;ubject it&s;elf.

Then we &s;hew'd that Pa&s;&s;ion was the chief thing in Poe|try, and great Pa&s;&s;ion in great Poetry, and that either ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion or En|thu&s;ia&s;m. Then we &s;hew'd that Sacred &s;ubjects were as &s;u&s;ceptible of ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, as the Prophane and more &s;u&s;ceptible of the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, which

la&s;t we &s;hew'd by Rea&s;on and by Example. So that to give a convinc|ing Rea&s;on why the Ancients did, and mu&s;t for the mo&s;t part excel the Moderns in Epick Poetry in Tra|gedy, and the greater Ode, we have nothing to do, but to &s;hew, that tho&s;e Poems among the Ancients were always Sacred, becau&s;e it is very well known, that among the Moderns, they are for the mo&s;t part Prophane. Fir&s;t, then for Tragedy, that is very well known to have been Sacred in its in&s;titution, and it is full as plain, that it mu&s;t have been Sacred in its original Nature, and after that the Epi&s;odes began to Intrench up|on the Chorus, it &s;till continued Sacred, as having Apo&s;trophes, Revelations, In|vocations, Machines. And &s;o had the greater Ode. And as for Epick Poe|try, in that the elde&s;t of the Mu&s;es after the fir&s;t Invocation was believed to Dictate every thing; be&s;ides, that the Gods were every where introduced in it, and all things were done by their Mini&s;tery.

<P>THat the Ancients in the <HI>Epos,</HI> in the Ode, and in Tragedy, deriv'd their preheminence from Religion, may appear from &s;everal things that have not yet been mention'd, and fir&s;t of all from this, that they did not excel the Moderns in Poetry, in which they drew no advantage from Religion, as in Comedy and in Satyr, and that in Hi&s;tori|cal Poetry, as the <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> of <HI>Lucan,</HI> whenever the Ancients excell'd the Mo|derns, they drew their advantage from Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="81">
For Comedy the Ancients are &s;o far from excelling the Moderns in it, that the advantage is clearly on our &s;ide. For I &s;hall make no &s;cruple of preferring <HI>Mo|liere,</HI> and two or three of our own Comick Poets, to <HI>Terence</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tophanes.</HI> For whe|ther the de&s;ign of Comedy, be to in&s;truct or to plea&s;e, or both, the Modern Comedy an&s;wers both tho&s;e ends incomparably better than the Ancient. If the end of Co|medy be only to plea&s;e, why then it mu&s;t plea&s;e by the <HI>Ridiculum</HI>; for that which is the end of any &s;ort of Writing whate|ver, mu&s;t be attain'd by a way, that mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h that &s;ort of Writing. As, for example, the end of Tragedy and of E|pick Poetry is to in&s;truct. But the latter in&s;tructs chiefly by Admiration, and the former by Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror. Now Admiration di&s;tingui&s;hes Heroick Poetry, and Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror Tra|gedy, from all other &s;orts of Poems whatever; but the only thing that di|&s;tingui&s;hes the plea&s;ure which Comedy gives us, from the plea&s;ure that we re|ceive from all other &s;orts of Poems whatever, is the <HI>Ridiculum.</HI> Now the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> in the Modern Comedy, is beyond Compari&s;on Higher than it is in
<PB N="52" REF="82">
the new Comedy of the Ancients, and be|yond Compari&s;on more in Nature, than it is in the old one. And it is higher both in the Incidents, and in the Cha|racters. For if the end of Comedy is to plea&s;e, and that end is to be attain'd by the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> why then the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> ought to be &s;pread throughout it. But be&s;ides, that it is higher in the Modern Comedy, there is a greater variety of it both in the Incidents and in the Cha|racters, and that variety mu&s;t make it the more delightful. For a uniformity in this ca&s;e takes away from the &s;urprize, and without &s;urprize the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t. And be&s;ides, that the Mo|derns have a greater variety both of Characters and Fables, they have a great|er variety of Style. For the Style of the Comedy of the Ancients, and particularly of <HI>Terence</HI> his Comedy, does not &s;eem to me to be varied enough, nor proportioned enough to the Characters. The Slave in <HI>Terence</HI> &s;peaks with the &s;ame Elegance and the &s;ame Grace for the mo&s;t part that his Ma&s;ter does. But look into the Plain Dealer, and you &s;hall find as many Styles in it, as there are Characters. For <HI>Man|ly, Freeman, Plan&s;ible, Oliviae, Novel, E|li&s;ha,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="83">
the Widow <HI>Blackacre</HI> and <HI>Jerry</HI> have each of them a different Dialect, which be&s;ides the variety, mu&s;t be fur|ther delightful, becau&s;e it is an ex|act Imitation of Nature. For as every man has a different form of face, he has a different turn of mind, and con&s;e|quently a different ca&s;t of thought, and a different manner of expre&s;&s;ion. Add to this, that the Moderns &s;eem to know men better, and to dive into &s;ome latent foibles, into &s;ome Ridiculous Rece&s;&s;es, that were utterly unknown to the Ancients. So that in every good Comedy, at the &s;ame time, that we are diverted with the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> we are entertained with Di&s;coveries, which is very delightful; But if the chief de&s;ign of Comedy be to in&s;truct, as I make no que&s;tion but it is, becau&s;e publick &s;pectacles ought to con|tribute to the publick advantage, we &s;hall find, that the Modern Comedy ar|&s;wers this end too better than that of the Antients. If the de&s;ign of Comedy be to in&s;truct, it mu&s;t in&s;truct by the <HI>Ridi|culum,</HI> for the very &s;ame Rea&s;on, that we affirm'd it mu&s;t plea&s;e by it, becau&s;e it is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the means, by which it attains its end, But no|thing but the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> can di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="54" REF="84">
Comedy from all other Poems. But Comedy in&s;tructing by the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> that <HI>Ridiculum</HI> ought to be both in the Fables and Characters. Fir&s;t, it ought to be in the Characters, or el&s;e it cannot be in the Incidents, and con&s;equently there can be no Comedy. For the manners of the Agents produce the Incidents. Se|condly, it ought to be in the Incidents, or el&s;e it would follow, that there would be manners in the Agents, which are not productive of action, which ought not to be. Be&s;ides, Comedy in|&s;tructs by its Fables or Characters, or both. If it in&s;tructs only by its Cha|racters, as &s;ome Criticks have thought, yet the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> ought to be in the Action too, or the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of the In|cidents would check the in&s;truction, as well as the plea&s;ure, which we receive from the Characters. But if it in&s;tructs by its Fable and Action, as certainly it ought to do, why then the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> mu&s;t be in the incidents which are parts of the Action, becau&s;e Comedy in&s;tructs by the <HI>Ridiculum</HI>; and con&s;equently this la&s;t ought to reign chiefly in the Cata&s;trophe, which ought to be the mo&s;t in&s;tructive part of the Fable, and
<PB N="55" REF="85">
to make the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Be|&s;ides, there are but two ways of in&s;truct|ing by example, and tho&s;e are, the &s;hew|ing men Ridiculous for their faults, or unfortunate, to repre&s;ent them expos'd by them, or cha&s;tis'd for them. But if Comedy &s;hews men unfortunate, it u|&s;urps upon Tragedy. The great Di&s;|orders of the world are caus'd by great Pa&s;&s;ions, and they are puni&s;h'd by Tra|gedy. The little Pa&s;&s;ions cau&s;e little Di&s;|quiets, and make us unea&s;ie to our &s;elves and one another, and they are expos'd by Comedy. For, that which we call Hu|mour in Comedy, is nothing but a little Ridiculous pa&s;&s;ion, and the expo&s;ing it in Comedy is thought to be Poetical Ju&s;tice &s;ufficient for it: Not but that at la&s;t the Characters in Comedy may be cha&s;tiz'd at the Cata&s;trophe for faults which they have committed; but that very Cha&s;ti&s;ement ought to be wrapt up in the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> or the Cata&s;trophe cannot be truly Comical. For as the Cata&s;trophe of a Tragedy ought to be the mo&s;t Tragical part of it, becau&s;e Tragedy in&s;tructing by Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror, tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions ought to be mo&s;t &s;trongly mov'd in the mo&s;t In|&s;tructive part of the Fable; &s;o the Cata|&s;trophe
<PB N="56" REF="86">
of a Comedy ought to be the mo&s;t Comical part of it for the very &s;ame rea&s;on; for Comedy in&s;tructing by the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> as has been &s;hewn above, the mo&s;t In&s;tructive part of it ought to be mo&s;t Ridiculous. But now if 'tis the end of Comedy to In&s;truct, and it in|&s;tructs by the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> the Modern Comedy mu&s;t be more In&s;tructive than the Ancient could be. For the <HI>Ridicu|lum</HI> in the old Comedy of the Ancients, was very often out of Nature, both in the Characters and in the Incidents, and con&s;equently could not in&s;truct. And the <HI>Ridiculum</HI> in their new Come|dy being not &s;o &s;trong as it is in ours, neither in their Characters not in their Incidents, could not In&s;ttuct &s;o powerfully; and the Moderns having greater variety of it both in their per|&s;ons and action, the In&s;truction in the Modern Comedy mu&s;t be the more ex|ten&s;ive, be&s;ides that the variety of Acti|on and Incidents mu&s;t make our Cata|&s;trophes more &s;urprizing, and con&s;equent|ly more Ridiculous.</P>
<P>So that the Modern Comedy plea&s;ing more, and in&s;tructing more, and &s;o an|&s;wering the two ends of Comedy better than the Ancient did, it follows that
<PB N="57" REF="87">
the Moderns in Comedy are preferrable to the Ancients.</P>
<P>As the Moderns have excell'd the An|cients in Comedy, they have equall'd them in Satyr. There has been a long di&s;|pute among the Criticks, whether <HI>Ho|race</HI> or <HI>Juvenal</HI> ought to be preferr'd in Satyr. Their excellencies indeed are are very different, and therefore a Com|pari&s;on is not ea&s;ie to be made. <HI>Horace</HI> had a great deal of plea&s;antry, and <HI>Ju|venal</HI> a great deal of force, at lea&s;t for his way of writing. Now <HI>Boilean</HI> has ju&s;tly got a great Reputation both for force and plea&s;antry, and con&s;equent|ly is equal to either of the <HI>Roman</HI> Saty|ri&s;ts; And here it will not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the very &s;ame Poets among the Moderns, who have &s;urpa&s;s'd the Ancients in Comedy, and who have e|quall'd them in Satyr, have faln infinite|ly &s;hort of them when they have at|tempted the greater Poetry, as <HI>Ben John|&s;on</HI> comes behind them in Tragedy, and <HI>Boilean</HI> in the greater Ode.</P>
<P>As for Hi&s;torical Poetry, any one who is acquainted with <HI>Lucan</HI> may have ob|&s;erv'd, that where that Author is very great, he derives his greatne&s;s from Re|ligion; as he does, for example, in <HI>Ca|to</HI>'s

where-ever he is very great and poeti|cal, he mu&s;t be &s;o by the greatne&s;s of ordinary pa&s;&s;ion, or by the force of Enthu&s;ia&s;m. But ordinary pa&s;&s;ions can neither be very frequent in an Hi&s;torical Poem; nor if they could, could they be frequently great. Becau&s;e there being no Fable, and no Art, they can &s;eldom be rightly prepar'd. Nor can the En|thu&s;ia&s;ms be frequently great where there is no Religion. But Religion cannot be frequent in an Hi&s;torical Poem, un|le&s;s it is in Sacred Hi&s;tory. If any one would give him&s;elf the trouble of comparing the Twelfth Book of the <HI>Aeneis</HI> with the &s;eventh of the <HI>Phar&s;a|lia,</HI> he would find that <HI>Virgil</HI> is ten times greater than <HI>Lucan,</HI> and that <HI>Lucan</HI>'s &s;ubject, as far as it is Humane, is ten times greater than <HI>Virgil</HI>'s. For, I hope, no man will compare <HI>Aeneas,</HI> take him without his Divine Dependencies with <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> the greate&s;t of men, nor the Combat that made the former King of the <HI>Latins,</HI> with the Battel that made <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of the World. From whence it would follow, if the greatne&s;s of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Subject con&s;i&s;ts in any thing Humane, that either <HI>Lucan</HI>'s writing in his Seventh Book is twenty
<PB N="62" REF="92">
times below his Subject, or that the Wri|ting of <HI>Virgil</HI> in his Twelfth Book is twenty times above his. But <HI>Lucan</HI>'s writing in his Seventh Book is not twen|ty times below his Subject, as any Mo|dern Poet that &s;hould be oblig'd to han|dle that Subject after him, would be forc'd to confe&s;s. Nor is the writing of <HI>Virgil</HI> in the la&s;t of the <HI>Aeneis</HI> &s;o many degrees above his &s;ubject. For if it is, then that la&s;t Book is &s;curvily writ, be|cau&s;e the thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions ought to be proportion'd to the things. But the la&s;t Book of the <HI>Aeneis</HI> is admirably writ. What then can be the meaning of all this? Why the meaning mu&s;t be, that <HI>Virgil</HI>'s &s;ubject is twenty times great|er than <HI>Lucan</HI>'s. But <HI>Lucan</HI>'s &s;ubject is ten times greater than his as far as it is only Humane, which has been made to appear. The excellency then of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s &s;ubject mu&s;t come from &s;omething that is not Humane, and that mu&s;t be from Religion; &s;o <HI>Virgil</HI>'s greatne&s;s and his Enthu&s;ia&s;m comes from his Machines, and the Mini&s;tery of the Gods, and the other parts of his Religion, and <HI>Lucan</HI>'s littlene&s;s, from his want of tho&s;e Ma|chines, and that Mini&s;tery&punc; <HI>Petronius</HI>

We have &s;hewn that the Subject of <HI>Vir|gil</HI> in the Twelfth of his <HI>Aeneis,</HI> is very much greater than <HI>Lucan</HI>'s is in the Seventh of his <HI>Phar&s;alia.</HI> We have &s;hewn too, at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Lucan</HI>'s was greater as He found it, and that <HI>Virgil</HI>'s was greater as He made it. For I hope I need &s;ay nothing at this time of day to prove that the Religious part of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Subject was Invented and Di&s;pos'd by the Poet. Which may &s;how the benefit of Art, that is, of Rules in Poetry. For, tho 'tis by the Genius of a Writer, that is, by a Soul that has the power of expre&s;|&s;ing great Pa&s;&s;ions, whether ordinary or Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, that we treat a Subject with Dignity equal to its greatne&s;s, yet 'tis Art that makes a Subject very great, and con&s;equently gives occa&s;ion for a great Genius to &s;hew it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And thus we have &s;hewn that the An|cients did not excel the Moderns in Co|medy and Satyr, which are not Sacred Poems, as having neither Invocations, Apo&s;trophes, Revelations or Machines; at lea&s;t the new Comedy had none of all the&s;e, and the old one only &s;ome low Burle&s;que or el&s;e Grote&s;que ones.

<P>But as the Ancients did not &s;urpa&s;s the Moderns in Poetry that was not Sacred, &s;o in that &s;ort of Poetry where they did excel them, they were never &s;o admirable as where they were mo&s;t Religious.

tho&s;e Machines, and tho&s;e Re|velations are all Miraculous. And the man who was admirable before for his extraordinary Valour and his Native Greatne&s;s, becomes more wonderful, when we behold him the e&s;teem and immediate concern of Heaven, when we &s;ee him the 'peculiar care of Pro|vidence, when we find the order of Nature inverted, the Skies grown facti|ous upon his account, and Gods de|&s;cending to &s;u&s;tain or oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>But Secondly, Terror and Compa&s;&s;i|on, which are the Reigning Pa&s;&s;ions in Tragedy are Heighten'd by Religion. Tragedy, &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his Poetick, is the Imitation of an action which ex|cites Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror. Now tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions proceed from Sur|prize, when the Incidents &s;pring one from another again&s;t our expectation. For tho&s;e Incidents, continues the Phi|lo&s;opher, are always more admirable than tho&s;e which arrive by chance; which is evident from this, &s;ays he, that even of accidental things, tho&s;e are always the mo&s;t wonderful and mo&s;t &s;urprizing, which at the &s;ame time that
<PB N="68" REF="98">
they arrive by Chance, &s;eem to fall out by De&s;ign; and by a certain particular &s;ecret conduct, of which Nature was what they relate of the Statue of <HI>Mitys</HI> at <HI>Argos,</HI> which fell upon his Murderer, and kill'd him upon the &s;pot, in the mid&s;t of a great A&s;&s;embly. For that by no means, &s;ays the Philo&s;opher, &s;eems to be the work of Chance. From whence ir follows, &s;ays he, of nece&s;&s;ity, that tho&s;e Fables where there is this conduct, will always &s;eem preferable to tho&s;e that have it not. Thus <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> declares that the Wonderful in Tragedy, as well as in Epick Poetry, is Heightned by Re|ligion, that tho&s;e Tragical Incidents that appear to have mo&s;t of Providence in them, are always mo&s;t moving and Terrible. The Rea&s;on is plain. For all cur Pa&s;&s;ions are grounded upon the Love of our &s;elves; and Terror and Compa&s;&s;ion &s;pring from the Calamities of our equals; that is, of tho&s;e who being in circum&s;tances re&s;embling ours, and committing faults which we either commit, or to which we are liable, are upon that unfortunate. For the more there appears to be of Providence in the puni&s;hment, the more we pity the per|&s;ons.
<PB N="69" REF="99">
For if their calamities appear to be the work of Chance, they might as well have hapned to tho&s;e who have not committed &s;uch faults, as to tho&s;e who have. And therefore a Train of Incidents, which, contrary to our ex|pectation, &s;urprizingly produce one ano|ther, is nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the more plainly the puni&s;hment appears the re|&s;ult of the faults, and the more clearly we are convinc'd of this when we lea&s;t expect it, Providence appears the more in the ca&s;e, and our &s;ecurity is &s;haken the more, and the more we are mov'd and Terrified. But Religion does not only heighten tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which are great in them&s;elves, as Admiration and Ter|ror are; for Admiration rai&s;es the Soul, and every thing that is Terrible, is cer|tainly great to him to whom it is Ter|rible, but it ennobles tho&s;e which are commonly ba&s;e and dejected; as for example, Grief; witne&s;s that pa&s;&s;age in the Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dido:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Te&s;tatur moritura Deos, &amp; con&s;cia Fati Sydera.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="70" REF="100">
And that Noble Apo&s;trophe afterwards:</P>
<Q><L>Sol qui Terrarem flammis, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>And that Sublime Apo&s;trophe of <HI>Seinon</HI> in the Second Book:</P>
<Q><L>Ille Dolis in&s;tructus &amp; arte pela&s;g&acirc;</L>
<L>Su&s;tulit exutas vinclis, ad Sydera palmas,</L>
<L>Vos eterni ignes &amp; non violabile ve&s;trum</L>

<L>Quos fugi, vittae&abque; Deum quas Ho&s;tia ge&s;&s;i, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>But to come to the other &s;ort of Pa&s;|&s;ion, which gives Poetry its force and its greatne&s;s, Religious Enthu&s;ia&s;m mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be greater than Human En|thu&s;ia&s;m can be, becau&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions that attend on Religious Ideas, when a man is capable of Reflecting on them as he &s;hould do, are &s;tronger than tho&s;e which attend on Prophane Ideas, as has been &s;aid above, and has been partly &s;hewn by examples. And as ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion is Heightned by Religion, &s;o Human Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions are height|ned
<PB N="71" REF="101">
by Religious Enthu&s;ia&s;m. We &s;hall give an example of this in Terror, by which I mean not that Common Pa&s;&s;ion which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> treats of in his Rheto|rick and in his Poetick, and of which we &s;poke in the former part of this Chapter; but that Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Terror, which &s;prings from the Ideas unknown to him who feels it. <HI>Virgil</HI> in his fir&s;t Book of the <HI>Aeneis</HI> de&s;cribes a Tempe&s;t, which carries Double Terror along with it; the ordinary one, which &s;prings from the concern which we have for the Hero; and the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick one, which the Ideas would carry along with them, tho they were &s;eparated from that concern which we feel for the He|ro. The De&s;cription is Grave, and Se|vere, and Exalted, becau&s;e the Poet was mov'd by the Terrible Ideas. For that which is Terrible, is always great to him to whom it is Terrible, as we &s;aid before; and that which is Great is Ad|mirable, and then he who is Terrified is always &s;erious, and very much in Ear|ne&s;t. The &s;ame De&s;cription where the Terror is at the Height is vehement.</P>
<Q><PB N="72" REF="102">
<L>In&s;equitur cumulo praeruptus aquae Mons,</L>

<P>Becau&s;e that which is very Terrible is Wonderful and A&s;toni&s;hing, and he who is a&s;toni&s;h'd, being tran&s;ported be|yond him&s;elf, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity expre&s;s him&s;elf with that &s;ort of Fury which we call Vehemence. <HI>Virgil,</HI> by &s;etting &s;o many Terrible Images in motion, had &s;et this Tempe&s;t before his Eyes, or ra|ther had tran&s;ported him&s;elf as it were into it. Now, any one who has been upon the brink of a Wreck, and con&s;e|quently has been very much Terrify'd him&s;elf, and &s;een others A&s;toni&s;h'd, cannot but have felt the &s;ame motions that he feels in Reading this pa&s;&s;age, and cannot but have ob&s;erv'd that others who felt them, expre&s;s'd them&s;elves with the &s;ame Fury and Vehemence that the Poet does, tho not with the &s;ame Elegance. But tho this Storm is Terri|ble in it &s;elf and Wonderful, yet the Machines, which prepare, and rai&s;e, and allay it, very much add to its Great|ne&s;s
<PB N="73" REF="103">
and genuine Terror, and it is quite another thing when it is con&s;ider'd with the cau&s;e of it, which is the Anger of <HI>Juno,</HI> and the Compliance of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and with that which follow'd upon it, which is the Indignation of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and the exertion of his ab&s;olute power.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages of the Ancient Poets that were mo&s;t Religious, were their Invocations, Apo&s;trophes, or the like; or tho&s;e which contain'd the Miraculous part of their Religion, their Signs, Ap|paritions, Oracles, and other Revela|tions.</P>
<P>For their Invocations, Apo&s;trophes, and the like, which were all of them either a &s;ort of Prayers, or Divine At|te&s;tations, they are mo&s;t of them very &s;ublime, and attended with a &s;trong Enthu&s;ia&s;m. And how could it be o|therwi&s;e, but that the Ancient Poets, who were men of great Learning, of great Pa&s;&s;ions great Eloquence, and great Parts; when with &s;tudy and pains, and with all their endeavours to be Enthu&s;i|a&s;tick, they addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to their Gods, &s;hould be extremely agitated, when we &s;ee very plainly that a &s;ort of Mo|dern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who have neither

Learning nor Parts, nor the lea&s;t tincture of good Letters, are even in their Ex|tempore Prayers di&s;turb'd with very fierce Enthu&s;ia&s;ms.</P>
<P>For the Apo&s;trophe, we have given examples of it already, and therefore we &s;hall only &s;ay here, that <HI>Longinus</HI> men|tions it as one of the Figures that con|tribute the mo&s;t to the Sublime. For the Invocation, we &s;hall bring an Ex|ample of it, from the &s;eventh Book of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and the Reader is de&s;ir'd to take notice what addition of Enthu&s;ia&s;m at|tends it.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, any thing that immediately concerns Revelation has &s;o great an In|fluence upon Poetry, that it is able to change even the Nature of Writing, and Exalt that very &s;ort of Poetry, which by its Character is Low and Humble; as for Example, the Eclogue: The fourth Eclogue of <HI>Virgil</HI> will be ea&s;ily granted by all to be very Sublime. But what is it that makes it &s;o? Why there is at once in that Eclogue an Invocation, and an Apo&s;trophe, and a Revelation of &s;undry Miracles to come. The Fifth Eclogue between <HI>Menalcas</HI> and <HI>Mop&s;us,</HI> begins with all the Humi|lity, and all the Simplicity, that is pro|per and peculiar to the Eclogue.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. That the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poetry flouri&s;h'd with their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion flouri&s;h'd in <HI>Greece</HI> from the time of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who was either the Original In&s;tituter,
<PB N="82" REF="112">
or at lea&s;t a vehement propogater of that Idolatry, till the Age after that in which <HI>Sophocles</HI> flouri&s;h'd, that is, for the &s;pace of about eight hundred years, and in that &s;pace of time flouri&s;h'd all their Po|ets, who are celebrated for their excel|lence in that &s;ort of Poetry which we call Sacred. Which alone is a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that the&s;e Poets deriv'd their excellence from Religion. In &s;hort, the advantage which their Poetry drew from Religion mu&s;t needs be very con|&s;iderable, when for all or mo&s;t of the fore-mention'd &s;pace of time, according to the Te&s;timony of <HI>Plutatch,</HI> and &s;eve|ral others of their authentick Writers, it made mo&s;t of their Zealots, even their common people Poets, and that even in their ordinary conver&s;ation. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Gentleman who writ the Hi&s;tory of Oracles, treats this as a Ficti|on, and a Fiction &s;o palpable as not to be worth the an&s;wering. But perhaps that Gentleman had not con&s;ider'd this matter enough. For I de&s;ire the Reader to con&s;ider two things. Fir&s;t, the ex|traordinary incentives which tho&s;e peo|ple had to Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which is one qualification for Poetry; and &s;econdly,
<PB N="83" REF="113">
the habit which they might very pro|bably contract of Ver&s;ification. To be &s;atisfied of the fir&s;t, let us enquire a little into the nature of their Religion: And upon enquiry we &s;hall find, that the ve|ry &s;ource, and &s;pring and &s;oul of it was an imaginary or pretended Revelation, and that that Revelation was &s;uppos'd to be con&s;tant and continual, as it mu&s;t be of every Religion which has no &s;ound Morality. They had their pub|lick and private Revelations, as Oracles, Vi&s;ions, Dreams, Apparitions. And Gods and Godde&s;&s;es, Nymphs and Demi-gods, Fawns and Satyrs were &s;een by Imagi|nation in every Grove, on every Moun|tain, and in every Valley, as &s;oon as ei|ther the Horrors of the place, or its &s;i|lence, or their fears, or their wi&s;hes, or their contemplations had di&s;pos'd their minds to be Religiou&s;ly impos'd upon. Now what &s;ort of Pa&s;&s;ions, and what &s;ort of Spirit mu&s;t be produc'd in them by the&s;e Imaginations, we may gue&s;s by what happens among our &s;elves, when any one believes that he has &s;een an Apparition. The man is alter'd quite in a moment; his colour, his mein, his comportment are all different: Nor are
<PB N="84" REF="114">
they who hear him the &s;ame, but are all of them &s;urpriz'd, tran&s;ported, a&s;to|ni&s;h'd, and all of them very profoundly attentive. Now very few that have any Judgment have any Notion that an Ap|parition will do them any harm, nor has any one an example of it, that may be ea&s;ily credited. But the Ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> had notions, that their Gods had power to de&s;troy them, or make them happy, and they had a thou&s;and Examples of it, in <HI>Mu&s;eus,</HI> and <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Homer,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Fathers of their Church, which mu&s;t cau&s;e the Emotions upon the fancied Apparitions, or the Relations of them to be the great|er, and fill their Souls with more turbu|lent Pa&s;&s;ions, and a greater Religious Horror.</P>
<P>But then let us con&s;ider, &s;econdly, that the&s;e Zealots mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure have contracted a Habit of Ver&s;i&s;icati|on from their Religious duties. For the very common People in <HI>Greece,</HI> had with quick apprehen&s;ions a great deal of vivacity; and therefore I leave the Reader to gue&s;s, what effect the Read|ing <HI>Mu&s;eus,</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Orpheus,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Fathers of their Church,
<PB N="85" REF="115">
for their whole life-time, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily have had upon their Minds; toge|ther with their Praying, Prai&s;ing, Sa|crificing and Thank&s;giving in Ver&s;e: Why, may not they very well be &s;up|po&s;ed from all this, to have contracted a Habit of Ver&s;ifying?</P>
<P>And why may not that Habit, joyn'd to their continual Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Moti|ons, which they had, either from the Revelations which they fancied that the Gods imparted to them&s;elves, or from the Relations of tho&s;e, which they believed were vouch&s;afed to others; or from the performance of the fore&s;aid Religious Duties, and from their Ritual, which their Poets had compos'd with &s;o much Enthu&s;ia&s;m, capacitate them to expre&s;s, them&s;elves Poetically even in common Society; as well as &s;ome whole Sects of our Modern Fanaticks in <HI>England,</HI> who have by no means the vivacity of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> are enabled from the continual Reading of Scripture, and the Imaginary Dictates of the pri|vate Spirit, to make up their ordinary conver&s;ation almo&s;t wholly of Scripture language.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="116">
But &s;ince the&s;e Vi&s;ions and the&s;e Appa|ritions, joyn'd to their con&s;tant Reading the Poets, had &s;uch a mighty influ|ence upon the people, what mu&s;t they not have had upon their Prie&s;ts the Poets, who having &s;tronger pretences to tho&s;e Revelations, and more earne&s;t and eager application to the Reading of the Poets, who writ before them, and who be&s;ides having &s;trong Imaginations and great Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;till greater Souls to command them, were qualify'd to draw an extraordinary advantage from them? When the&s;e, who&s;e pecu|liar bu&s;ine&s;s it was to take care of Re|ligion, at any time writ upon Religious Matters, what Gravity, what Severity, what Elevation, what Vehemence mu&s;t they not nece&s;&s;arily derive from their &s;ubject?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Objection an&s;wered.</HEAD>
<P>BUt here 'tis convenient to an&s;wer an Objection; for here it will be urg'd, that the Ancient Poets among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> being men of extraordi|nary parts, could not believe any thing &s;o ab&s;urd as the Revelations and Miracles mention'd in the former Chapter, and con&s;equently could not draw any ad|vantage from them. To which I an|&s;wer, that fir&s;t they might draw an ad|vantage from them tho they did not be|lieve them; and &s;econdly, that they did believe them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Suppo&s;ing they did not believe them, yet they might very well draw their advantage from them. For every one is brought up in the Reveal'd Reli|gion of his Country, and con&s;equently believes it for the fir&s;t part of his life. Now every one knows that the force of
<PB N="88" REF="118">
Education, and the Influence of fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions is great, and e&s;pecially upon the minds of tho&s;e who have &s;trong Imaginations. And &s;uppo&s;ing that the Poets, when they &s;et them&s;elves to write, were not &s;atisfied about the Truth of the Revelations of which they treat|ed, yet the former &s;trong Enthu&s;ia&s;tick motions, that they were wont to have upon the like Ideas in the fir&s;t years of their youth, would certainly follow upon them again, whenever they had heartily a mind to give into them.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, a man may have a very good under&s;tanding, and yet believe a fal&s;e, nay, even an ab&s;urd Revelation. The Revelation of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is both fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, and yet &s;everal among the <HI>Turks,</HI> who have &s;hewn them&s;elves men of extraordinary parts for &s;everal years together, have at la&s;t convinc'd the world of the &s;incerity of their belief, by very frankly &s;ubmitting to die at the Command of their Emperors, when they could with a great deal of ea&s;e have de|clin'd it. For 'tis &s;o rea&s;onable to be|lieve that there &s;hould be &s;uch a thing as Revelation, of which we &s;hall &s;peak more at large anon; and all Revelati|ons
<PB N="89" REF="119">
are &s;o little to be comprehended by us, that a man even of a good under|&s;tanding will be oblig'd to believe an ab&s;urd one rather than none. Be&s;ides, the Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets knew no o|ther Religion than the <HI>Grecian</HI> Revela|tion. For they had neither any clear Idea of one Supreme Independent Being, nor any tolerable knowledge of the Law of Nature. For all the great Poets among the <HI>Grecians</HI> flouri&s;h'd before the Doctrine of <HI>Socrates</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the world, and before that e&s;tabli&s;hment they had neither any certain knowledge of the True God, nor any tolerable no|tion of the Law of Nature. For had there been that, there would have been a &s;y&s;tem of Morality; but <HI>Socrates</HI> was the fir&s;t who introduc'd Moral Philo&s;o|phy into that part of the world.</P>
<P>And here the Mythologi&s;ts may pre|tend as long as they plea&s;e, that the Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets, by the number of their fal&s;e Gods, meant only the dif|ferent notions of the true. 'Tis plain they had no clear and di&s;tinct Idea of one Supreme and Infinite Being: For either the Knowledge of the True God mu&s;t be drawn from Rea&s;on or Revela|tion
<PB N="90" REF="120">
From Revelation they could not draw it, becau&s;e their own Revelation was not true: And if they had the know|ledge of the true God from any other Revelation, of which perhaps &s;ome of them might have heard imperfectly, why then that knowledge was imper|fect, and could con&s;equently not be clear: And to deduce that knowledge from Rea&s;on a man mu&s;t u&s;e a great deal of attention and a great deal of application. But in tho&s;e times the Cor|ruption of the <HI>Grecians</HI> was too great, and their Pa&s;&s;ions were too &s;trong, and the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on was too little known among them, to u&s;e either the attention or the application. But be|&s;ides all this, there is &s;omething in the Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets that is repugnant to the Divine Nature, as is known to every one who has been conver&s;ant with them, and that alone renders all the Conjectures of the Mythologi&s;ts Ridi|culous.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, we have a great deal of Rea&s;on to be convinc'd that the Anci|ent <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets, I mean their Sacred Poets, did believe the Revelations they neated of, becau&s;e as their Poetry flou|ri&s;h'd
<PB N="91" REF="121">
with their Revelation, &s;o at la&s;t it fail'd with it, as we &s;hall &s;hew at large in the following Chapter.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. That the greater Poetry among the <HI>Graecians</HI> fail'd with their Re|ligion.</HEAD>
<P>AS Epick Poetry, Tragedy, and the Greater Ode, flouri&s;h'd with Re|ligion among the Ancient <HI>Grecians,</HI> &s;o together with Religion they fail'd. Now in order to the proving this, let us en|quire how and when the <HI>Grecian</HI> Reli|gion fail'd. We have &s;aid in one of the former Chapters, that the very &s;pring and &s;oul of that Religion was a con|&s;tant continual Revelation, as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been of &s;uch a Religion as had no Morality. The <HI>Grecians</HI> wor&s;hipp'd many Gods, but before they wor&s;hipp'd them, they mu&s;t believe that they were, and that they wanted neither power nor will to make them either hap|py
<PB N="92" REF="122">
or mi&s;erablc. Now of the&s;e two things they were convinc'd by Imagi|nary or pretended Revelations, as by Oracles, Vi&s;ions, Dreams, Apparitions, and a thou&s;and Fanta&s;tick Miracles. Now as long as the&s;e were in credit in <HI>Greece</HI> Polythei&s;m went on Triumphantly. For they who had neither any in&s;ight into the True Religion, nor any tolerable habit of Rea&s;oning, could never argue again&s;t matter of Fact as long as they made no doubt of the Truth of it. But as &s;oon as the matter of fact came to be &s;u&s;pected, the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wor&s;hip was un|dermin'd and weaken'd very con&s;idera|bly. To be convinc'd of this, we need only con&s;ider the De&s;ign of that Reve|lation, and the methods of carrying it on, and we &s;hall find that that very De|&s;ign, and tho&s;e very Methods, made a certain way for its ruine. We have &s;aid above that no Religion which wants Morality can outla&s;t its Revelation. For if Morality is not for it, it will be again&s;t it. And 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how any Religion can be permanent, which has neither Miracles nor Human Rea&s;on to &s;upport it. Now it will be an ea&s;ie matter to &s;hew two things, fir&s;t, that
<PB N="93" REF="123">
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion was without Mo|tality; and &s;econdly, that the very De|&s;ign of it, and the Methods of carrying on that De&s;ign, introduc'd Moral Phi|lo&s;ophy, by a very natural prepara|tion.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion, &s;eems to me to be the providing for the Happine&s;s of Mankind in this life, by drawing them out of a &s;tate of War, and making them live peaceably and &s;e|curely among one another.</P>
<Q><L>Sylve&s;tres Homines, Sacer Interpre&s;&abque; Deorum</L>
<L>Caedibus &amp; victu faedo deterruit Orpheus.</L></Q>
<P>Says <HI>Horace,</HI> in his little Treati&s;e <HI>De Arte Poetica.</HI> That is:</P>
<Q><HI>Orpheus,</HI> the Sacred Interpreter of the Gods, deterr'd &s;avage men from Mur|dering one another, and reclaim'd them from the Barbarous Brutal lives which they led.</Q>
<P>Now this De&s;ign he was to bring a|bout by Religion, and Revealing the pretended will of the Gods. In order to which it was nece&s;&s;ary to give the people
<PB N="94" REF="124">
&s;uch a Religion as might be agreeable to them in the condition in which they were. For otherwi&s;e they would not have hearken'd to it. Now, to give them a Religion that might be agree|able to them, it was nece&s;&s;ary to give them &s;uch a one as might Maintain and Indulge their Pa&s;&s;ions. For, when the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wor&s;hip was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, the corruption of that people was &s;o very great, that tho the In&s;tituter had known the pure Law of Nature, he dur&s;t never have preach'd it to them, becau&s;e their Pa&s;&s;ions were then too &s;trong to receive it. Well, then <HI>Orpheus,</HI> or <HI>Linus,</HI> or whoever was the fir&s;t In&s;tituter of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion, was oblig'd to Main|tain and Indulge the Pa&s;&s;ions, which I am apt to believe that he had no notion of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, becau&s;e he believ'd them all to be natural, and &s;aw by experience that &s;ome of them contributed to the Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s of Mankind. The In&s;tituter then of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wor|&s;hip was oblig'd to Maintain the Pa&s;&s;i|ons; but here lay the difficulty. The very crimes that kept men a&s;under, and in a &s;tate of War, were caus'd by &s;ome of tho&s;e very Pa&s;&s;ions; what then was
<PB N="95" REF="125">
to be done in this ca&s;e? Why, He was oblig'd to give tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions a diver|&s;ion, and to Indulge and Maintain the re&s;t in the &s;ame condition in which he found them. As for example, Rage and Fury were the principal pa&s;&s;ions that maintain'd men in a &s;tate of War, and occa&s;ion'd the frequent Murders that were daily committed among them. Now the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions being grown up with them, and by con&s;equence become habitual to them, it would have been very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;up|pre&s;s them. The fir&s;t In&s;tituter then of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion thought fit to give tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions a vent a le&s;s cruel way, and for that purpo&s;e in all likelihood in&s;tituted the <HI>Orgies of Bacchus.</HI> But the pa&s;&s;ions that were not utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with Society, he indulg'd in the condition in which he found them, as the Love of Women, Wine, &amp;c. For, all that the Founder of that Religion could pretend to at fir&s;t, was to bring men out of a greater confu&s;ion into a le&s;s, and not to reduce them to perfect order. Therefore, by &s;hewing the Gods addicted to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, he encou|rag'd the people to cheri&s;h them, nay,
<PB N="96" REF="126">
to &s;uch an Intemperance as was repug|nant to the original Law of Nature, nay, even to &s;uch a criminal degree, as was afterwards forbidden by the Laws of the <HI>Grecian</HI> States. For Intemperance in the u&s;e of Wine and of Women is contrary to the Dictates of Natures ori|ginal Law, and yet was encourag'd by the Examples of &s;ome of their Gods, and Rapes and Adulteries and Ince&s;t were encourag'd by the &s;ame Examples at fir&s;t, without any manner of Counter|check. For, either the Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Theology was contriv'd at fir&s;t without any Infernal Puni&s;hments, or they were only threaten'd to &s;uch crimes as were contradictory of civil Society. But afterwards, as Confu&s;ion le&s;&s;en'd, and Order increas'd, and other Crimes were found to be more repugnant to Community, and &s;o were forbidden by the Laws, the Magi&s;trates in all likeli|hood oblig'd the &s;ucceeding Poets to threaten tho&s;e who dar'd to commit them, with the puni&s;hments of another World, and &s;o to make up the Infernal Scheme by Degrees. Thus have I en|deavour'd to &s;hew by the mo&s;t probable Conjectures I could make, what was the
<PB N="97" REF="127">
original De&s;ign of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> and what method he took to compa&s;s it. But this is pa&s;t all doubt, that the original Revelation of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wor&s;hip was Repugnant in &s;everal points to the primitive Law of Nature, and the &s;uc|ceeding Laws of the <HI>Grecian</HI> States. Now the method which <HI>Orpheus,</HI> or whoever was the fir&s;t founder of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion, had taken, was main|tain'd by &s;ucceeding Poets, only here and there, as occa&s;ion &s;erv'd, they in|termingled precepts of Ju&s;tice and Tem|perance; which precepts are by no means to be look'd upon as parts of that Revelation, but as Remnants of Natu|ral Religion and of the Law of Nature, which the Pa&s;&s;ions had not been able totally to &s;uppre&s;s; or the efforts and &s;trugglings of Rea&s;on, recovering from its Lethargy by Degrees. But the Poets and Law-givers could not give good precepts with a great deal of good &s;uc|ce&s;s, as long as the Gods were believ'd to give ill examples. For the people look'd upon their Laws, unle&s;s they were inforc'd by Religion, as made on|ly for the conveniency of life, and trang&s;gre&s;t them whenever they could
<PB N="98" REF="128">
with Impunity; and the precepts &s;cat ter'd up and down in the Poems wer but Impotent Imperfect efforts of Rea|&s;on, and utterly unable to prevail a|gain&s;t a continual con&s;tant Revelation, and a train of perpetual Miracles.</P>
<P>But now let us con&s;ider how this De&s;ign of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> or whoever was the fir&s;t In&s;tituter of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion, let us &s;ee how his De&s;ign in &s;etting up his Theology, together with the Methods that were us'd for carrying it on by him and &s;ucceeding Poets, &s;ecretly pre|par'd the way for its utter ruine. For the bringing men in a body together, and cau&s;ing them more frequently to conver&s;e with one another, was the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of the cultivating Humane Rea&s;on, and was con&s;equently one pre|paration to the Introduction of Moral Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>And the Laws that were made by their Legi&s;lators, and the Precepts that were given by their Prie&s;ts and Poets, in con&s;equence of mens convening and conver&s;ing together, had been &s;en&s;ible encroachments upon the Revelation, as being manife&s;t contradictions of it, if men had been us'd to reflect. At la&s;t,
<PB N="99" REF="129">
after Miracles and Revelations had pre|vailed for the &s;pace of almo&s;t eight hundred years, <HI>Socrates</HI> aro&s;e a mo&s;t ex|traordinary man, who finding that the Precepts that had been &s;cattered here and there, for the Regulation of Hu|mane Life, and the Laws that had been given for the maintaining of Order in Communities, were all contradictory of the Revelation, but all agreeing perfectly with one another in the promoting of the &s;ame De&s;ign, which was the welfare of tho&s;e who ob&s;erv'd them, he had rea&s;on to enquire a little more narrowly into the Revelation, and to find that that was contradictory too of it &s;elf. For the Cele&s;tial and the Infernal Schemes of the Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Theology, &s;eem'd &s;o utterly incon&s;i&s;tent, that as I hinted be|fore, they could never be conceiv'd to be both given ou't at a time; but it was rea&s;onable to believe, that fir&s;t the Ce|le&s;tial Scheme was invented, and after|wards the Infernal made up by degrees, in order to the &s;erving the ends of Go|vernment. For not only the Infernal Deities rigorou&s;ly puni&s;h'd tho&s;e very Crimes, which the Cele&s;tial Gods had by their Examples encourag'd men to
<PB N="100" REF="130">
commit: but which is very odd to con+&s;ider, their Hell &s;eem'd to be fill'd with their Good Gods, and their Heaven with Devils. For whether we con&s;ider <HI>Pla|to</HI> or <HI>Pro&s;erpine,</HI> or the Judges, or the Fates, or the Furies, the&s;e were all of them very rigorous, and if you plea&s;e inexorable; but then they were all of them very ju&s;t, and foes and inexora|bie only to guilt, and never any of them did any harm to Virtue. But at the &s;ame time that the Magi&s;tracy of Hell was compos'd of the&s;e hone&s;t upright Per&s;ons, Heaven on the other &s;ide was fill'd with all &s;orrs of Scoundrels, Rakes, Cuckolds, Bullies, Pimps and Bawds, and Cuckold makers; and no Virtue, and no Innocence could &s;ecure either Men or Women, from the&s;e Immortal Scow|rers. Nay, men often &s;uffer'd for their Temperance, and women for their Cha&s;ti|ty. <HI>Socrates</HI> then con&s;idering the ab&s;urdity of the Revelation, and the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Laws and Precepts that were di&s;tinct from it: The agreement of the latter among them&s;elves, and the incon|&s;i&s;tency of the former, cultivated the one, and contemn'd the other, and by the force of a &s;trong and clear Rea&s;on
<PB N="101" REF="131">
and a long conver&s;ation with all &s;orts of people, brought the Exerci&s;e and Ha|bit of rea&s;oning into Reque&s;t, and by little and little introduced a &s;y&s;tem of Morality, re&s;tor'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure Na|tural Religion, and recover'd the Law of Nature. Thus <HI>Socrates</HI> gave the world a Sy&s;tem of Morality, and tho his Contemporaries had not rea&s;on enough to make the di&s;covery them&s;elves, yet they had &s;en&s;e enough to approve of it when it was made, and to be convinc'd of the Truth of it, and con&s;equently to be &s;a|tisfy'd that the Revelation was fal&s;e. For &s;eeing that Virtue, and Order and Happine&s;s, I mean in &s;ome degree, &s;prung from Philo&s;ophy, and Vice and Confu|&s;ion and Mi&s;ery from the Revelation; and &s;eeing the Philo&s;ophy was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Inferences, which very naturally flow'd from the&s;e Intelligent Faculties, which, whatever power had form'd man, had given him to be his guide; and &s;eeing the Philo&s;ophy and the Revela|tion contradictory one of another, they could not find in their hearts to believe that the Gods could be &s;o unju&s;t as to de&s;ign the mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion of Man|kind, or &s;o ab&s;urd as to give them two
<PB N="102" REF="132">
rules to walk by, that were contradi|ctory one of another.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;tment then of Moral Phi|lo&s;ophy, was the ruine of the old Reve|lation, and &s;o made way for a new. For after the death of <HI>Socrates,</HI> there &s;tarted up &s;everal Sects of Philo&s;ophers, as the <HI>Cyrenaicks, Cynicks, Peripateticks, Epicureans, Scepticks,</HI> &s;ome of them im|mediately, but all within a hundred and fifty years, who were all of them mor|tal Enemies, not only to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Revelation, but to Reveal'd Religion in general: Tho in the la&s;t they certainly went beyond the de&s;ign of their com|mon Ma&s;ter <HI>Socrates,</HI> who&s;e intention was to reform Revelation, and not to ruin it. And thus upon the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Moral Philo&s;ophy, the credit of Oracles was dimini&s;h'd con&s;iderably, and Apparitions, Vi&s;ions, &amp;c. were contemn'd and exploded, and with them down went the greater Poetry: for you will find upon enquiry, that there was no Poet among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who was born after the death of <HI>Socrates,</HI> who writ with a great Spirit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. That the Greater Poetry among the <HI>Romans</HI> flouri&s;h'd and fail'd with their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THat the <HI>Grecians</HI> deriv'd their pre|heminence in the greater Poetry from Religion, may appear not only becau&s;e they flouri&s;h'd and decay'd toge+ther, but becau&s;e the <HI>Romans,</HI> who&s;e Country was not like <HI>Greece,</HI> the Scene of perpetual Miracles, and who for a long time had no corre&s;pondence with <HI>Greece,</HI> had no &s;uch thing as the Spirit of Poetry among them, till they came to Conquer that Country.</P>

<P>For there was &s;omething in the In&s;tituti|on of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, as it was e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by <HI>Numa Pamphilius,</HI> that le&s;&s;en'd the credit of Divine Apparitions con&s;ide|rably.
<PB N="104" REF="134">
'Tis true, <HI>Numa</HI> founded his Sa+cred E&s;tabli&s;hment upon the Authority of Apparitions; but at the &s;ame time that he profe&s;t a familiarity with the Godde&s;s <HI>Aegeria,</HI> and with the Mu&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.</HI> Life of <HI>Numa.</HI></NOTE> he taught the people, that no re&s;emblance of the Gods could be made, nor any likene&s;s to repre&s;ent them. The fir&s;t was a Fiction to &s;erve a turn in Politicks, and the latter a Truth that was contra|dictory of the other. And he had need have very gro&s;s people to deal with, that could &s;wallow &s;uch a contradiction as that: For if no Form or Likene&s;s of the Gods could be made, in what Like|ne&s;s could they appear to him, or how could he di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Aegeria</HI> from the Mu&s;es, or the Mu&s;es from one another? I am apt to believe that <HI>Numa</HI> ven|tur'd this contradiction upon the gro&s;s|ne&s;s of the people with whom he had to deal, becau&s;e the Truth and Fiction were equally nece&s;&s;ary to his Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Policy. For as his Authority was grounded upon the Fiction, &s;o it was &s;trengthen'd by the Truth; for the ap|pearing of the Immortal Powers to <HI>Nu|ma</HI> had not made him &s;o venerable, if &s;uch Apparitions had been common to

every one. However, this contradicti|on was &s;wallowed by the People, and <HI>Numa</HI> upon it, gain'd both his Points; for he was held to be a Sacred Per&s;on, and the Gods were e&s;teem'd invi&s;ible. So that for a hundred and &s;ixty years, &s;ays <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in the Life of <HI>Numa,</HI> there was no &s;uch thing as a Statue in their Temples, nor any talk of the Gods ap|pearing to them. For how could tho&s;e numerous Gods, whom they wor&s;hipp'd, with any po&s;&s;ibility appear to them, &s;ince they could make no likene&s;s of them. At length, the Super&s;tition of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Idolatry by degrees encreas'd upon them; and having conquer'd <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Carthage,</HI> and &s;o got an in|&s;ight into the Arts, and lei&s;ure at once to cultivate them, the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion, and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Arts grew up together among them; and of all the Arts Poe|try was the fir&s;t that was cultivated, be|cau&s;e it was incorporated with their Re|ligion. So that thereappears to me to be this con&s;iderable difference between the greater Poetry of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and that which was among the <HI>Romans,</HI> that the <HI>Grecians</HI> deriv'd their Poetick Enthu&s;ia&s;m from the Miracles of their Religion,

<P>So that the latter appears to me to be but a Copy as it were of the former. For, in effect, the <HI>Romans</HI> copied the <HI>Grecian</HI> Spirit: For we have &s;hown from <HI>Horace</HI> the be&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Criticks, that the <HI>Romans</HI> had no &s;uch thing among them till they had conquer'd <HI>Greece,</HI> nor had they any &s;uch frequent Impul&s;es to En|thu&s;ia&s;m, and having the &s;ame Revela|tion at the time that they cultivated Poetry, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> had, they could hardly &s;ay any thing of their Gods or their Demi-Gods, or their Fa|bulous Transformations, that the <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Poets had not &s;aid before them. Be&s;ides, the mo&s;t famous of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets copied particular <HI>Grecian</HI> Authors, as <HI>Horace</HI> did <HI>Pindar,</HI> and con&s;equently fell &s;hort of them in the freene&s;s and flame of their Spirit, as Copies mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily do of Originals.

the be&s;t of them were directly tran&s;lated from the <HI>Athenian</HI> Poets.</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets copied the <HI>Grecian</HI> Spirit, what is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Romans</HI> copied them &s;o much better than we do?

<P>Poetry began to be cultivated at <HI>Rome</HI> after the Conque&s;t of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the end of the Thid <HI>Punick</HI> War.</P>

<P><PB N="108" REF="138">
Now nothing is more rea&s;onable than to believe that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Super&s;tition, from which the Spirit of their Poetry was deriv'd, was at a greater height at <HI>Rome,</HI> after the <HI>Romans</HI> had conquer'd the <HI>Grecians,</HI> than it could be before they had a continual corre&s;pondence with that people. But be&s;ides, Religion in the main may be thought to be in a very great e&s;teem among the <HI>Romans</HI> about the time that they began to culti|vate Poetry.</P>
<P>In order to the proving which, let us enquire what was the fountain and &s;ource of Religion among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and upon what it chiefly depended. The chief &s;upport of Religion among the <HI>Grecians</HI> was the con&s;tant Revelation by Oracles; but the <HI>Italian</HI> Oracles were more rare, and of much le&s;s re|nown. The prop and &s;upport of the <HI>Roman</HI> Super&s;tition lay in their Divina|tions, as <HI>Machiavel</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;es ob|&s;erves. For, &s;ays <HI>Machiavel,</HI> they ea&s;ily believ'd that that Divinity that foretold their felicity had the power to effect it. <HI>Machiavel</HI> had rea&s;on to be of that opi|nion. For, how could their Gods be thought certainly to foretell what it was
<PB N="109" REF="139">
not in their power certainly to effect? And thus did the <HI>Roman</HI> Wor&s;hip depend in a very peculiar manner upon the credit of their Divinations. But now let us en|quire in what credit the Divinations were when Poetry began to be cultiva|ted; which, as we ob&s;erv'd above, was after the third <HI>Punick</HI> War.</P>
<P>Now the credit of the Augurs and the Aru&s;pices mu&s;t needs at that time be ve|ry great with the <HI>Romans.</HI> For, &s;ince good Fortune alone inclines men to De|votion, and to confide in the Gods, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has ob&s;erv'd in the Second Book of his Rhetorick; what thoughts mu&s;t not the <HI>Romans</HI> have of their Sooth&s;ay|ing, when they were not only arriv'd at &s;uch a Degree of Felicity, but be|liev'd that they ow'd all their greatne&s;s to the predictions of their Augurs. For they con&s;ulted them upon every impor|tant conjuncture, and particularly be|fore they gave Battel. 'Tis true, they had &s;ometimes fail'd, but where they had fail'd once, they had &s;ucceeded ten times; which is evident from the felicity of that Commonwealth. Now, if one lucky gue&s;s can &s;upport our ordinary Fortune|tellers, who are wretched contemptible
<PB N="110" REF="140">
bonds, again&s;t a hundred that happen unfortunate, as we know by experience it does, in what height of Reputation mu&s;t not the Sooth&s;ayers be, who&s;e Or|der it &s;elf was held to be Sacred and Augu&s;t, when they had apparently &s;uc|ceeded ten times for their failing once. The <HI>Romans</HI> were now become the greate&s;t people upon the Earth, and the Promi&s;e of <HI>Romulus</HI> reveal'd to <HI>Proculus,</HI> according to the Oath of the latter, that <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hould be the Mi&s;tre&s;s of Na|tions; that promi&s;e, which at fir&s;t &s;eem'd &s;o very incredible, was now very likely to be accompli&s;h'd. And the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> believ'd that they had been con|ducted by the predictions of tho&s;e Di|viners, as it were by &s;o many &s;teps, to that height of Glory, at which they were in Triumph arriv'd, and from the which they had a certain pro&s;pect of becoming Ma&s;tersof the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Divination then being in very great credit in the age in which Poetry began to be cultivated, Religion, which had its chief dependance upon it, mu&s;t con|&s;equently needs be in very great credit too, which was the thing that we de|&s;ign'd to prove.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="141">
But from what has been &s;aid it nece&s;|&s;arily follows, that any one that &s;hould have brought Divination into di&s;grace, mu&s;t have given a terrible &s;hock to the &s;uper&s;tition of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Now, a|bout a hundred and three&s;core years af|ter Poetry began to be cultivated, being introduc'd by <HI>Livius Andronicus,</HI> there flouri&s;h'd a great Wit, who not only baffled the whole My&s;tery of Divinati|on in a learned Philo&s;ophical Treati&s;e, but al&s;o publi&s;h'd an extraordinary Book concerning the Nature of the Gods, which alone, &s;ays Mr <HI>Harrington,</HI> in his preliminaries to his <HI>Oceana,</HI> was &s;uffici|ent to overthrow the Religion of the <HI>Roman</HI> State. Thus <HI>Cicero</HI> contriv'd and effected him&s;elf the very Crime, for which he declaim'd again&s;t <HI>Cataline</HI> with &s;o much vehemence, and undermin'd the mo&s;t &s;olid foundations of the Temples of the <HI>Roman</HI> Gods.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time the <HI>Athenian</HI> Philo&s;ophers began to e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves at <HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> who&s;e Coun|try <HI>Pompey</HI> had &s;ubdu'd, began every day to re&s;ort more and more to the World's Capitol. The <HI>Romans,</HI> thro an exce&s;s of ridiculous flattery, deify'd their deceas'd
<PB N="112" REF="142">
Emperors, which alone was enough to make the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion ridiculous; and Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to introduce a new Revelation. What was the effect of all this upon the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Religion? A Super&s;tition that had made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of that people, and from which they ima|gin'd that they and their Ance&s;tors had receiv'd &s;o much benefit, could not be utterly overthrown in a moment. The <HI>Romans</HI> were &s;o very pertinacious in their Principles, and had &s;o much flegm and con&s;tancy in their con&s;titutions, that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;ophy, and the Doctrine of <HI>Cicero,</HI> requir'd &s;ome time to prevail. However, prevail they did; and with them the Chri&s;tian Religion got ground, and the Pagan declin'd; and the Super&s;tition and Poetry of the <HI>Romans</HI> gradually declin'd together. And the Declen&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poe|try was attributed even by <HI>Petronius</HI> him&s;elf, who was a thorough-pac'd Epi|curean, to the neglect of the old Theo|logy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Objections an&s;wer'd. Conclu&s;ion of the former part of the Work.</HEAD>
<P>But here it concerns us to an&s;wer &s;ome Objections, which we ea&s;ily fore&s;ee may be made. For if the Reli|gion which the <HI>Romans</HI> borrow'd from the <HI>Greeks</HI> had &s;o great an influence on their Poetry, and the two Treati&s;es which <HI>Cicero</HI> writ concerning Divination and the Nature of the Gods, gave &s;uch a &s;hock to that Super&s;tition; How comes it to pa&s;s that Poetry not only flouri&s;h'd afterwards, but came to perfection in <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> which two were the greate&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets. In an|&s;wer to which we &s;hall endeavour to &s;how as &s;uccinctly as we can, why Poe|try flouri&s;h'd after the publication of tho&s;e Treati&s;es, and why it afterwards came to perfection. To &s;atisfie the Rea|der why Poetry flouri&s;h'd afterwards, we need only repeat what we ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="114" REF="144">
above, that the flegm and &s;olidity of the <HI>Roman</HI> people, and perhaps their Politicks, &s;u&s;pended the effect of tho&s;e Writings, and of the Doctrine of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;ophers; and when they began to &s;pread, it is rea&s;onable to be|lieve that they went downwards from the <HI>Patricians</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> Knights to the people, who in all probability were the la&s;t who were undeceiv'd. Now the greate&s;t of their Poets, and e&s;pecially <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> flouri&s;h'd within le&s;s than fifty years after the publication of tho&s;e Treaties, and were mo&s;t of them very meanly de&s;cended. So that they were brought up in the Religion of their Country, and had con&s;equently when they came to write, the advantage of fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions, and their copying the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poetry, threw them upon the old Idea's. 'Tis true, &s;ome few of them were better de&s;cended, and were <HI>Roman</HI> Knights, but either they were too much Men of Plea&s;ure, to dive into Philo&s;o|phy, or too much Poets, to e&s;pou&s;e a Sect that would not favour Enthu&s;i|a&s;m.</P>
<P>But now let us enquire with the &s;ame brevity, for what rea&s;on Poetry, that de|rives
<PB N="115" REF="145">
its preheminence from Religion, came to perfection among the <HI>Romans,</HI> after the&s;e attacks had been given to the Religion of that State: In an&s;wer to which, we mu&s;t put the Reader in mind, that there are three things which con|tribute to the perfection of Poetry. The fir&s;t is Nature, which is the foundation and ba&s;is of all. For Nature is the &s;ame thing with Genius, and Genius and Pa&s;|&s;ion are all one. For Pa&s;&s;ion in a Poem is Genius, and the power of exciting Pa&s;&s;ion is Genius in a Poet; to the rai|&s;ing of which, Religion, as we have &s;hewn above, gives a very great Advan|tage. The &s;econd thing is Art, by which I mean tho&s;e Rules, and that Me|thod, which capacitate us to manage every thing with the utmo&s;t dexterity, that may contribute to the Rai&s;ing of Pa&s;&s;ion. The third thing is the In&s;tru|ment by which the Poet makes his Imi|tation, or the Language in which he writes. By Language I do not mean here the expre&s;&s;ion of any particular Poem, or the poetical Dialect which the Poet models him&s;elf; but the lan|guage of the Country in which he writes, and which he finds made to his
<PB N="116" REF="146">
hands. The&s;e are the three things that contribute to the perfection of Poetry; &s;o that in any Age or Country, at what|ever juncture Religion and Language and Poetical Art are in greate&s;t force together, at that very juncture the Poe|try of that Country is at its heighth. And this is the rea&s;on why Tragedy, which is a Poem of the growth of <HI>At|tica,</HI> was at its height in the time of <HI>So|phocles,</HI> becau&s;e then the Language was in perfection; the Art of Poetry, and particularly of Tragedy, had been ex|tremely cultivated, and Religion as yet had power enough o're the minds of men to inforce the pa&s;&s;ions. But the greate&s;t of the&s;e three is Religion, and the mo&s;t prevalent towards the advancement of Poetry, as is plainly &s;een by the event. For, after that the Introduction of Moral Philo&s;ophy had ruin'd the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Religion among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> Tragedy immediately lo&s;t its force, tho the language remain'd in perfection af|terwards, and the Poetick Art was per|haps improv'd. Let us now examine how the Art of Poetry, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Language and the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion &s;tood in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> The Art of
<PB N="117" REF="147">
Poetry, which had been introduc'd by <HI>Livius Andronicus,</HI> had now been culti|vated for about two hundred years, but with a great deal of Interruption, caus'd by the violences of tho&s;e times; and that it was at its utmo&s;t height in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> we have no great rea|&s;on to doubt, becau&s;e we find more of the Poetical Art in the &s;ingle <HI>Aeneis</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> than in all the re&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets together. For the Language, that it was then at its height, is agreed on by mo&s;t; and tho &s;ome few may contend that it was &s;omewhat declin'd from the purity which it had in the preceding age, yet it was certainly more Poetical in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> that is, more full, more &s;ounding, more &s;ignificant, and more harmonious. And as for Re|ligion, we have already &s;hewn that the effect of the Writings of <HI>Cicero</HI> was &s;u&s;|pended by the flegmatick temper which was incapable of &s;udden Impre&s;&s;ions, and perhaps by the politicks of the <HI>Ro|mans.</HI> But that was not all. Religion had then more Force, more Authority and more Maje&s;ty, than it had had for &s;ome time before; and that by the ex|ample of the Emperor. No one can be
<PB N="118" REF="148">
ignorant what influence the example of a Prince has upon the minds of the peo|ple. Now <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was in his temper Religious even to Super&s;tition. And tho during the violences of the Trium|virate, his Politicks had got the better of Nature in him, yet a&s;&s;oon as he had attain'd the Soveraign Power, Policy and Nature were reconcil'd, and both of them favour'd Religion; whereas the Age preceding had been an Age of continual Violences, and con&s;equently not of &s;o much Religion. The <HI>Roman</HI> Senate having got the Lands from the People had con&s;equently got the Domi|nion, &s;o that that famous Common|wealth was dwindled into an Oligarchy, and that Oligarchy was grown factious, as all Oligarchies mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity do; and the heads of tho&s;e Factions were all of them labouring who &s;hould over|throw the State; &s;o that they who were at the Helm of the State, neither were nor could appear good, becau&s;e there was a nece&s;&s;ity of their giving pernicious Examples. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf, notwith|&s;tanding his natural clemency, and his pronene&s;s to Super&s;tition, was drawn in by Ambition to the committing all man|ner
<PB N="119" REF="149">
of violences in the beginning of the Triumvirate, and neither did nor dur&s;t appear what he was, till dividing the World between him&s;elf and <HI>Anthony,</HI> Po|licy and Nature were reconcil'd in him, and he was oblig'd to appear rather more Debonaire and Religious than he was by his Natural Temper, that the Extra|vagancies of <HI>Anthony</HI> appearing more hideous, compar'd with the Beauty of his Character, he might in&s;en&s;ibly un|dermine his Rival in the e&s;teem of the Senate and the <HI>Roman</HI> people, and a|lone command the Univer&s;e; and we may judge by this, what influence the Example of the Emperor had upon the Writers, that it not only prevail'd upon <HI>Virgil</HI> to make Piety one of the chief In|gredients in the Character of his Hero; who was de&s;ign'd by the Poet the very Picture of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> but engag'd him to incorporate &s;o much Religion with the Action of his Poem, that it is the mo&s;t Religious Epick Poem that ever was writ in the World.</P>
<P>And thus we have endeavour'd to &s;hew as briefly as we could, that Art and Lan|guage and Religion were all of them in a great deal of force together in the glorious
<PB N="120" REF="150">
Reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and much more pow|erfully united than ever they had been before, and I hope I need not tell the Reader than ever they were in the Reigns of &s;ucceeding Emperors. And in &s;hewing that, I have given the rea&s;ons why the <HI>Roman</HI> Poetry was then at its utmo&s;t height, tho I make no doubt but that a &s;ettled calm and a full tranquility, after a fierce and a tedious Tempe&s;t; and the elevation that might &s;pring from the Remains and the Appearances of Liberty, and con&s;equently the appear|ances of their being Ma&s;ters of the Uni|ver&s;e; and la&s;tly, the never to be for|gotten bounty of a magnanimous Prince, and the Emulation that mu&s;t en&s;ue upon it among &s;o many extraordinary men, might all of them contribute to the ad|vancement of Poetry.</P>
<P>But if the Writings that flouri&s;h'd a|among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and e&s;pecially in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> receiv'd &s;uch advantage from the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, that the ex|cellence and greatne&s;s of their Poetry is chiefly owing to that, how comes it that <HI>Virgil</HI> is found in his Writings to have had &s;o exalted a notion of God, as is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Gre|cian</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="151">
Theology? How comes it to pa&s;s, that <HI>Lucretius</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> are held to be thorough-pac'd <HI>Epicureans,</HI> on whom the Super&s;tition that reign'd among their Country-men could have no man|ner of influence, and yet <HI>Horace</HI> allow'd to be after <HI>Virgil</HI> the greate&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, and <HI>Lucretius,</HI> as <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> is pleas'd to call him, a mo&s;t Noble Ver&s;ifyer.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, <HI>Virgil</HI> had an exalt|ed notion of God, as we may &s;ee by &s;e|veral places in his works,</P>
<Q><L>Ab Jove principium Mu&s;ae, Jovis omnia plena.</L>

<P>Now this exalted notion of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or the Supreme Being, <HI>Virgil</HI> had from the Writings of <HI>Plato</HI>; and the re&s;t of the Gods and Godde&s;&s;es a little modifyed, as they are in that Poet, in whom we wee &s;ee none of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Religious extra|vagancies are exactly the <HI>Platonick</HI> Dae|mons. So that <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;trictly adhering to the <HI>Platonick</HI> Sect, it follows that his Philo&s;ophy did very little harm to his Religion.</P>
<P>But to proceed to <HI>Horace.</HI> He was &s;o very far from being a thorough-pac'd <HI>Epicurean,</HI> as &s;ome will ob&s;tinately have him, that he was of every Sect by turns, and chang'd his Philo&s;ophy and his Religion with his Humour, as a great many do be&s;ides him; and when that Humour inclin'd him to Libertini&s;m, then he was an <HI>Epicurean</HI>; and when|ever it turn'd about to Au&s;terity, then he became a <HI>Stoick.</HI> That there are a great many &s;uch per&s;ons in the world, we may take the word of the Duke <HI>De la Rochefant.</HI></P>

And that Invocation is undeniably one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t Poetical parts of his Book: So that <HI>Lucretius,</HI> to attain an excellence in Poetry, was con|tented to be guilty of a very &s;trange ab|&s;urdity in Philo&s;ophy. For, to what purpo&s;e does he Invoke the Godde&s;s of Love? Why he Invokes her to inform him that he ought not to Invoke her, for that &s;he does not hear him, and does not regard him, and has nothing at all to do with him.</P>
<Q><L>Omnis enim Divum per &s;e natura a nece&s;&s;e e&s;t</L>
<L>Immortali aeuo &s;umma cum pace fruatur,</L>
<L>Semota a no&s;tris Rebus &s;ejunta&abque; longe.</L></Q>
<P>For, let no one tell me here, that by <HI>Venus</HI> the Poet means only the genera|tive
<PB N="128" REF="158">
Faculty of things. In &s;hort, <HI>Lu|cretius</HI> Invokes &s;omething, and Invoca|tion is Adoration, and whatever is ador'd, mu&s;t during the action by the Adorer be e&s;teem'd a Deity.</P>
<P>But it is not only in his Invocation that <HI>Lucretius</HI> is pleas'd to have recour&s;e to Religion. For after that, in the two fir&s;t Books he has been taking a great deal of pains to de&s;troy the belief of Gods and Providence, that in his third he may be very Poetical and very Sub|lime, he is forc'd to erect a new Divini|ty in the room of tho&s;e whom he has been ju&s;t &s;ubverting; And that is Na|ture; tho by what he makes her &s;ay in that Noble <HI>Pro&s;opopaeia,</HI> we might very well mi&s;take her for Providence.</P>
<P>So that we have not only the opinion of <HI>Lucretius</HI> on our &s;ide, but the exam|ple too. For, by having recour&s;e to Religion in that very Philo&s;ophy that utterly di&s;claims it, he not only declares of what Importance he thinks it to be to Poetry, but has &s;hewn of what Im|portance it really is, by &s;ucceeding &s;o much better in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages than in the other parts of his Book. But how could a Materiali&s;t, the Reader may &s;ay, draw
<PB N="129" REF="159">
any advantage from Religion? But <HI>Lu|cretius</HI> was made, not born a Materiali&s;t. He was bred in the Religion of his Country, and &s;o had the advantage of, fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions which are never to be defac'd, <HI>Lucretius,</HI> you may &s;ay, perhaps was very lofty and very Poetical where he had nothing to do with Religion. Indeed &s;ometimes he was &s;o, for I do not remember that I affirmed that there can be no Poetry without Religion, but only that Religion gives the occa&s;ion for the be&s;t, the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t Exalt|ed, and it makes for my purpo&s;e &s;ufficient|ly, that <HI>Lucretius</HI> is mo&s;t Poetical and and Sublime where he is Religious. But where he is lofty in other places, we find him de&s;cribing the great <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, and the higher a man ri&s;es and the nearer he comes to the fir&s;t in|finite cau&s;e, the nearer he certainly comes to Religion. Be&s;ides, where <HI>Lucretius</HI> is lofty and Poetical in De&s;cribing the great <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of of Nature, there we are &s;ure to find him a&s;toni&s;h'd for from whence comes his vehemence but from his a&s;toni&s;hment, which may give us a Su&s;picion, that <HI>Lucretius</HI> was not &s;o very a&s;&s;ured of the
<PB N="130" REF="160">
truth of his opinion. For effects a&s;toni&s;h no man. He who is a&s;toni&s;h'd is moved by the &s;ecret cau&s;es of things which are two high or too deep for his com|prehen&s;ion. So that in places where there is no mention of Religion, <HI>Lucretius</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure derives from that his Impetuous Golden Torrent of Ver&s;e, his vehemence and his Sublimity.</P>
<P>And thus I have inquired into the me|rits of the Ancients, with all imaginable Impartiality, and have attempted to &s;hew that they had the advantage of the Mo|derns in the greatne&s;s of Poetry, but that they deriv'd it not from any Superiority of Faculties, or any external or internal advantage, ab&s;tracted from the nature of the &s;ubjects of which they treated, but only from incorporating Poetry with Religion.</P>

<P>IN the former part of this Treati&s;e we attempted to &s;hew, that the An|cient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> excell'd the Moderns in the greatne&s;s of Poetry, and
<PB N="132" REF="162">
&s;o endeavour'd to oblige a very con&s;i|derable party of Mankind; who ad|mire the Ancient Poets to that degree, that they de&s;pair of their being ever equall'd, much le&s;s &s;urpa&s;s'd by the Mo|derns; but then, that we might di&s;|oblige as little as we could another bo|dy of men, who have a high opinion of the Moderns, and are apt to think them upon an equal foot with the An|cients, we endeavour'd to prove that the Ancients deriv'd their preheminence, not &s;o much from any real &s;uperiority that they had in them&s;elves, as from the Subjects of which they treated; which Subjects were Sacred, either in their own nature, or by their manner of handling them.

For, in the remaining part of this Treati&s;e, we &s;hall make it our bu&s;ine&s;s to convince the Reader, with all the brevity that the Importance of the affair will admit of, that the Moderns, by joyning Poetry with the true Religi|on, will have much the advantage of the Ancients in the main, tho they may fall &s;hort of them in &s;ome particular Poems.</P>
<P>But here it concerns us to an&s;wer an Objection. For perhaps the Reader may &s;ay, how can you maintain that the Chri&s;tian Religion will be &s;uch a help to Poetry, when you have already in a former Treati&s;e, made u&s;e of the Authority of <HI>Boileau,</HI> to &s;hew that Chri&s;tianity and Poetry were things that were incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>

<P>That is,</P>
<Q>The terrible My&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian Faith are not capable of delightful Orna|ments; that the Go&s;pel offers nothing to our view, but Repentance on the one &s;ide, and Eternal Torments on the other, and that the Criminal mixture of Poetical Fictions, gave a fabulous air even to its mo&s;t Sacred Truths.</Q>
<P>To which we an&s;wer; that we only made u&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age in the fore|mention'd Treati&s;e, to &s;hew, that the My&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian Religion were not to be mix'd with Fiction, and con|&s;equently that it would be a hard matter to contrive <HI>Machines</HI> for an Epick Po|em, upon a Modern Chri&s;tian &s;ubject:
<PB N="135" REF="165">
and if <HI>Boileau</HI> means any thing more by the fore-mention'd pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;how that he is mi&s;taken, and that there may not only be mo&s;t exalted Poetry upon a Chri&s;tian &s;ubject, without Machines and without Fiction, but that the true Religion is more fa|vourable to Poetry than Pagani&s;m, or Philo&s;ophy or Dei&s;m; and I &s;hall fir&s;t enquire into the Rea&s;on of things, and afterwards &s;ee how it is &s;upported by Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;hall enquire into the Rea&s;on of the thing, and I make no doubt but to make it appear, that the nearer Poe|try comes to Perfection, the more a|greeable it is to the de&s;ign of the true Religion, and that con&s;equently Poetry is much more noble and more in&s;tru|ctive, and more beneficial to Mankind than either Hi&s;tory or Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>In order to the doing which, let us examine what the de&s;ign is of the true Religion, and we &s;hall find that not on|ly the de&s;ign of Poetry is the very &s;ame, but the very methods of attaining that de&s;ign the &s;ame, as far as they can be humanely pro&s;ecuted; tho at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that Poetry, tho
<PB N="136" REF="166">
the noble&s;t of all Arts, and preferable either to Hi&s;tory or Philo&s;ophy, falls as &s;hort of the Excellence of the true Re|ligion, as Human Invention does of Di|vine Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of every Religion mu&s;t be the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who embrace it. Impo&s;tors, and all who &s;et up new Re|ligions for &s;ome politick ends, mu&s;t al|ways pretend this, or they will have no followers; for all men propound Hap|pine&s;s to them&s;elves in every thing that they do; and the Rea&s;on why &s;o few men are throughly and entirely of any Religion, is, becau&s;e they are not &s;uffi|ciently convinc'd that it will make them happy. But as even fal&s;e Religions mu&s;t pretend to make tho&s;e who profe&s;s them happy, &s;o the true one mu&s;t real|ly effect it: For the true Religion, whe|ther it is innate or reveal'd, mu&s;t cer|tainly come from God, and mu&s;t be given by him as a Rule and a Law for tho&s;e who embrace it to walk by. Now all Laws that are made by good Law-givers, are made for the Happi|ne&s;s of tho&s;e who embrace them. But God mu&s;t be good, and con&s;equently cannot make Laws, only becau&s;e it is
<PB N="137" REF="167">
his Arbitrary will; no, he mu&s;t make them, becau&s;e he who be&s;t knows the nature of his own Creatures, knows that they will find their Happine&s;s in being conformable to them. But if the de&s;ign of all Religion mu&s;t be to make men happy, why then that mu&s;t be the true Religion that makes men the mo&s;t happy: And con&s;equently that mu&s;t be the true Religion that has the Simple&s;t De&s;ign, and the &s;horte&s;t and the &s;ure&s;t. For the de&s;ign of the true Religion be|ing to make men happy, it mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be of &s;uch a nature, as that all may be capable of it. For if a Reli|gion, of which none but men of &s;en&s;e were capable, &s;hould be the true Reli|gion, it would follow, that God had made mo&s;t men Blockheads, and after|wards made them wretched for being &s;o. But now let us examine what Re|ligion that is, that takes the &s;horte&s;t and the &s;ure&s;t, and mo&s;t admirable method for making tho&s;e who embrace it hap|py.</P>
<P>Since the de&s;ign of all Religion mu&s;t be to make men happy, and the only true Religion can effect that de&s;ign, which all others in vain pretend to, becau&s;e
<PB N="138" REF="168">
only the true Religion can come from God, who alone under&s;tands our na|tures, and alone knows that which the mo&s;t will plea&s;e us, it follows, that all who are not really of the true Religion, cannot be perfectly happy. Now this is certain, that Mankind has in all Coun|tries and in all Ages, in all Places and at all Times, complain'd of the want of Happine&s;s. Both Ancients and Moderns, Philo&s;ophers and the People, have a|greed that Man was mi&s;erable. And this univer&s;al con&s;ent may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the mi&s;ery of Man is real, and not imaginary; be&s;ides, they have all, both Ancients and Moderns, Philo|&s;ophers and Poets, Men of Sen&s;e, and the Vulgar, admirably agreed in de|&s;cribing it. They have all con&s;ented in this, that the mi&s;ery of Man proceed|ed from a perpetual conflict that is with|in him, and from a di&s;cord continually reigning among the faculties of the Soul; a cruel War between the Pa&s;&s;ion, and Sen&s;es, and the Rea&s;on, while the Rea&s;on violently draws one way, and the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Sen&s;es another; the latter endeavouring &s;till to be pleas'd by getting the upper hand of the for|mer,
<PB N="139" REF="169">
and the former contending to be &s;atisfied by &s;ubduing the latter, while neither party can gain an entire victory, but an eternal conflict remains; for tho the frequent advantages are on the &s;ide of the Pa&s;&s;ions, yet Rea&s;on rallies from time to time, and maintains a running fight.</P>

<P>Thus has St <HI>Paul</HI> given a lively De|&s;cription of the conflict that is in the Human Soul between Pa&s;&s;ion and Rea|&s;on, becau&s;e he very well knew the cau&s;e of it. The Philo&s;ophers felt the effect, and could de&s;cribe it tolerably well; but being wholly ignorant of the cau&s;e, they took that to be a Defect in Nature, which is really an infectious Di&s;temper; and here lay the folly of tho&s;e people, in believing that they were capable of altering Nature; which puts me in mind of an A&s;trological King of <HI>Naples,</HI> who not being very well pleas'd with what he thought the Sy&s;tem and Con|trivance of the Univer&s;e, &s;aid that if God when he made the World would have vouch&s;af'd to have con&s;ulted him, he could have given him very good ad|vice. For, &s;o by their Writings the Phi|lo&s;ophers &s;eem to have been of opinion,
<PB N="142" REF="172">
that whereas God had made Man Impi|ous, they could make him Good, and whereas he had made him a Blockhead, they could make him Wi&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Philo&s;ophers not knowing the cau&s;e of the mi&s;ery of Man, made very &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s attempts towards the making us happy; for whether they &s;upported the Rea&s;on again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;i|ons, all that they gain'd was to inflame the contention which they de&s;ign'd to extingui&s;h; and by rou&s;ing and exa&s;pera|ting the Parties make that War be carried on with vehemence, which perhaps was in a langui&s;hing &s;tate before; or whither they animated the Pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Rea&s;on, they could only mortifie what they could never vanqui&s;h.</P>
<P>Thus, whither they endeavour'd to live up to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, the Pa&s;&s;ions plagu'd them by a very violent re&s;i&s;tance; or whether they endeavour'd to plunge them&s;elves in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, they could no further oppre&s;s the Rea|&s;on than they &s;tupified the whole Man; and Remor&s;e at la&s;t, like the Dragon that watch'd the <HI>He&s;perian</HI> fruit, was never to be laid a&s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="173">
But tho the Philo&s;ophers &s;eem'd wholly in the dark, the Poets appear'd to have a glimmering of the Truth, as we may conclude from the Fable of <HI>Pandora</HI> and <HI>Epimetheus,</HI> whether they had it from old Tradition, or from a Noble Effort of Rea&s;on. For, &s;ays Mr <HI>Mede,</HI> If there were no Scripture, yet the un&s;ampled Irregularity of our whole Nature, which all the time of our life runs counter to all Order and Right Rea&s;on, the woful mi&s;ery of our condition being a &s;cene of &s;orrow, without any re&s;t or contentment, this might breed &s;ome general &s;u&s;picion, that <HI>ab initio non fuit ita,</HI> but that he who made us Lords of his Creatures, made us not &s;o worthle&s;s and vile as now we are, but that &s;ome common Father to us all, had drank &s;ome &s;trange and Devili&s;h Poy&s;on, where|with the whole Race was infect|ed. Thus far goes Mr <HI>Mede,</HI> and I will make bold to add, by the leave of the Clergy, that this Su&s;picion might very well grow up to Rea&s;on and Certainty, tho' there were no Scripture. For that Man is mi&s;erable, experience a&s;&s;ures us; but &s;ince Man is a Creature capable of
<PB N="144" REF="174">
Happine&s;s, and one who knows his mi&s;ery, Rea&s;on may tell us that Man could never be Created mi&s;erable, for that would have been contrary to the goodne&s;s of God, which is his Darling Attribute. Since God might as well Damn his Creatures for nothing, as he might Create them mi&s;erable. Man therefore was certainly created happy, and happy had he continued till now, if it had not been for his own fault, be|cau&s;e it had been repugnant to the Ju&s;tice of God, to puni&s;h Man for no|thing. Thus far we may conclude then by the force of Rea&s;on, that Man has committed &s;ome horrible crime, the which has made him mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>But tho' the &s;trength of Rea&s;on may reach thus far, yet it could never inform Man of the Nature of the crime, the committing of which has made him mi&s;erable, nor in what his original Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted. All that that we can gue&s;s by Rea&s;on is this, that &s;ince the mi&s;ery of Man at pre&s;ent lyes in the conflict that he has within him&s;elf, and in the Civil War which is maintaind in his faculties, that his original Hap|pine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in the Peace and Agree|ment,
<PB N="145" REF="175">
and the Harmony that was be|tween them, and that the Crime that cau&s;ed his unhappine&s;s, was in all like|lihood &s;omething that naturally and ne|ce&s;&s;arily broke that Harmony and that Agreement. And that we may &s;ee how far the&s;e conjectures agree with what our Religion &s;ays of it, let us make &s;ome enquiry into the account which Sacred Writ has given of it.</P>
<P>That tells us, that man was not in the beginning what he is at pre&s;ent. That he was created Holy, Innocent, Perfect. That his Creator fill'd him with the brightne&s;s of Knowledge, and with a luminous lively Intelligence. That he then had a &s;trict dependence on his Maker. That he communicated the wonders of his Glory to him. That the Eye of Man then &s;aw the Maje&s;ty of God; and that this Crea|ture, &s;o mi&s;erable now, was then mo&s;t entirely happy. That he was un|clouded, untroubled, impained, im|pa&s;&s;ive, immortal. This is the ac|count that our Religion gives us of the primitive &s;tate of Man. It tells us, how great his Knowledge was,
<PB N="146" REF="176">
his Happine&s;s and his Perfection. Let us now &s;ee how much his Pa&s;&s;ions and his Sences were able to contribute to &s;o much Felicity.</P>
<P>That Man in his Original State had Pa&s;&s;ions and great Pa&s;&s;ions, is certain. For without Pa&s;&s;ion there can be no Happine&s;s, becau&s;e there can be no Plea&s;ure. Be&s;ides, it mu&s;t be by a great Pa&s;&s;ion, or by great Pa&s;&s;ions that the fir&s;t Man mu&s;t fall. For by the weakne&s;s of his Rea&s;on he could not be lo&s;t: For if he had not had Rea&s;on enough to know that he ought not to have committed the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion which ruin'd him, why then the ruin of Man had not been his own fault. Man therefore before the Fall had Pa&s;&s;ions, but being in a &s;tate of Perfect Felicity, he could con&s;equent|ly be &s;ubject to no Pa&s;&s;ions, which were not entirely con&s;i&s;tent with that. He walked with God, and was then united to him, becau&s;e the Creator was plea&s;ed to communicate him&s;elf in &s;o great a degree to his Crea|ture. Man therefore con&s;tantly con|templated
<PB N="147" REF="177">
God, not &s;o much by the force of Rea&s;on as of Intuition, or a luminous lively Intelligence. God acted upon his mind, and he felt him as well as &s;aw him, and con|&s;equently Admir'd, Lov'd, De&s;ir'd, A|dor'd him, and the re&s;ult of the&s;e charming Pa&s;&s;ions was a Joy un|&s;peakable. For the more they were exalted, the more his Rea&s;on ap|prov'd of them; and &s;ince it knew that he could never &s;uffer by them in that &s;tate of Happine&s;s and of Im|mortality, it eternally exhorted him to perpetuate them, and told him that they could never be too high for their Glorious Object. So that man in his primitive State was always in lofty ravi&s;hing Tran&s;ports. For Love, Admiration, Joy and De&s;ire, tho&s;e charming Pa&s;&s;ions were all that he knew, of which Bli&s;sful Love was always the chief. For God making Man a &s;ociable Creature, gave him &s;uch a &s;ort of a Happine&s;s, as that the Felicity of one might produce that of another; and what could that be but an habitual Cha|rity, or loving God and Man for the &s;ake of God. Our bli&s;sful Sire enjoy'd
<PB N="148" REF="178">
a &s;incere felicity, and con&s;equently could never know any trouble, nor any pa&s;|&s;ion that had a mixture of trouble, as anger, &s;orrow, fear, and the like. Much le&s;s could Ambition find room in his brea&s;t, with Envy, Hatred, Pride, and Revenge, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e Turbu|lent pa&s;&s;ions that are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with Charity.</P>
<P>And as his pa&s;&s;ions were always plea&s;ing, &s;o his &s;en&s;es were never &s;hock'd: The happy creature conver&s;t with An|gels, and &s;aw the Maje&s;ty of his Maker. And for the Terre&s;trial Objects which were around him, and which were all &s;ubjected to his univer&s;al Empire, when|ever he &s;urvey'd them, like his Creator, he found that they were always good; and as the Creatures never were Di&s;|obedient, he was never Di&s;pleas'd with them. For, as he had neither fear nor knowledge of &s;uffering, Antipathy, A|ver&s;ion, Horrour, and the like, were things that he never knew, which in this woful &s;tate of mi&s;ery, are &s;o often Nature's &s;ecret Intelligencers, to advi&s;e us of approaching harm. Thus all the Faculties were always pleas'd, and man was ble&s;s'd un&s;peakably.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="179">
But the re&s;ult of this perfect Harmo|ny, was not only continual Happine&s;s, but unclouded Knowledge and Immor|tality. For, as from the Agreement of the vital Faculties, and their concord|ing motions, Spirit and Health and plea&s;ant Ea&s;e, and vigour of Sen&s;e pro|ceeds; &s;o from the Harmony of the Rational and Animal powers proceeded a luminous lively Intelligence, and a bli&s;sful Immortality. For plea&s;ure was the re&s;ult of that Agreement, and &s;ince Death can only come by pain, he who is in a &s;tate of perpetual plea&s;ure, mu&s;t by con&s;equence be Immortal.</P>
<P>But Man alas was unable to &s;upport &s;o much Happine&s;s without Pre&s;umpti|on. He form'd the De&s;ign of growing Independant, of &s;haking off the govern|ment of him who made him, and find|ing his felicity apart from God. This made him conceive the Horrible Crime, of Diverting his affections from him who alone was worthy of them; to things that were form'd &s;o many degrees inferiour to him: and that which made the unpardonable enormity of that crime was this, that when God had created him with an ardent de&s;ire of Happine&s;s,
<PB N="150" REF="180">
and had created him of &s;uch a nature, that his full and his perfect Happine&s;s lay in his &s;trict dependance on him, and had given him a clear under&s;tanding to know this; that, I &s;ay, made the un|pardonable enormity of his Crime, that, contrary to this Nature, and this De&s;ire, and this unclouded Knowledge, he re|volted and fell off from God, and by the &s;ugge&s;tion of his greate&s;t enemy, tax'd him at once with folly and envy, in believing him&s;elf capable of finding and enjoying a greater felicity than what his Maker de&s;ign'd for him. And thus Mans fatal Original Sin, whether the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Tree of Knowledge is Literal or Allegorical, con&s;i&s;ted in his horribly diverting his affections from his God to the Creatures. And thus the Harmony of his Intellectual and Animal powers was very mi&s;erably broke. For Rea&s;on di&s;approv'd of the unworthy objects that Man had cho&s;en for his Pa&s;|&s;ions, and the Pa&s;&s;ions being natural and congenial to the Soul, could not be idle, and Man could not reduce them to their primitive object. For God had abandon'd him to him&s;elf, and how &s;hould Man of him&s;elf approach Infinity?</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="181">
And now the bli&s;sful Time was no more, when Man was only touch'd with tran&s;porting Pa&s;&s;ions. And now the force of tho&s;e Charming Pa&s;&s;ions was continually curb'd by Rea&s;on, which utterly di&s;approv'd of their objects; and a thou&s;and vexatious ones &s;prung up among them, like cockle to choak the vital &s;eed, and which were partly the re&s;ult of pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, and partly of pa&s;t felicity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Sences partook of the &s;ame Di&s;order that had &s;eiz'd the Pa&s;&s;i|ons; and they that during his &s;tate of Innocence, were always pleas'd with the approbation of Rea&s;on, and were ne're Di&s;turb'd, now either betray'd him to Concupi&s;cence, or were &s;hock'd at their &s;everal objects. His Eye and his Ear, tho&s;e noble mini&s;ters of the Under&s;tanding, were no longer charm'd with the voice of God, and the glori|ous pre&s;ence of Angels; and were either too much engag'd by the Terre&s;trial ob|jects around them, or di&s;turb'd in de|&s;pight of Rea&s;on. The Creatures whom God had furni&s;h'd with in&s;tinct &s;uffici|ent for the care of their pre&s;ervation, in their Degenerate Monarch beheld
<PB N="152" REF="182">
their Enemy. They gladly obey'd him during his Innocence, as Loyal Subjects do a good King, but when he grew wicked he grew a Tyrant, and they at the &s;ame time turn'd Rebels. From hence Aver&s;ions, Horrors, Antipathies, and Fear and Hate and Rage &s;prung up in them; and Man was got into a &s;tate of War with all the inferiour Creatures, who of his Humble Va&s;&s;als before, were now his Potent Enemies. Both Parties were on their Guard ince&s;&s;antly, always dreaded, and always terrify'd.</P>
<P>And thus the Harmony of the Intel|lectual and Animal powers was di&s;&s;olv'd by Original Sin. And the Ignorance of this, caus'd all the blunders of the Phi|lo&s;ophers. They knew very well, that the Combat between the Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ions caus'd the mi&s;ery of Man, but they never dreamt of reconciling the difference, becau&s;e alas they never thought that the parties had once been friends. All that they aim'd at, was to put an end to the conflict, by de&s;troying one of the parties, and &s;o &s;ome of them thought of &s;tifling the Rea&s;on, and o|thers of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="183">
But the folly of the&s;e two De&s;igns was equally great, becau&s;e they are at|tempts at things that are equally Im|po&s;&s;ible. For as long as Man is Man he mu&s;t have Rea&s;on, and as long as there is Rea&s;on there will be Remor&s;e, which will rally from time to time, and be a check upon the exorbitance of the Pa&s;&s;i|ons. And tho Remor&s;e could be en|tirely extingui&s;h'd, as I believe it never can, yet Rea&s;on would be &s;ure to make its Declaration another way, and that is by our incon&s;tancy in plea&s;ure, and our want of variety.</P>
<P>Nor is the folly le&s;s of endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ions, for either they mu&s;t be wholly &s;uppre&s;s'd or re&s;train'd; But all the Pa&s;&s;ions being natural, in the condition in which Man is now, none of them can be wholly &s;uppre&s;s'd with|out de&s;troying the Man, nor can &s;ome of them be &s;o much as moderated, without maintaining con&s;tantly in the &s;oul a very violent conflict, becau&s;e they were perfectly unre&s;train'd in their ori|ginal Natures.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ions are either natural and congeneal to the Soul, or accidental: The&s;e fir&s;t are tho&s;e which are plea&s;ing
<PB N="154" REF="184">
to it, as Love, Joy, De&s;ire, and with the&s;e the fir&s;t Man was created, for Man was created Happy; but without the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions there can be no Happine&s;s. The accidental Pa&s;&s;ions, as Anger, Envy, In|dignation, and De&s;ire of Revenge, are tho&s;e with which Man at the fir&s;t was not created, for they all include Mi&s;ery, and he was created Happy. They were all the re&s;ult of the fall, which brought woe to the Race of Men. Man is in|deed capable of re&s;training the&s;e la&s;t, becau&s;e they all of them include Mi&s;ery, and he retaining a vehement de&s;ire of Happine&s;s, tho joyn'd to an impotence of attaining it, is by that very De&s;ire capacitated to &s;truggle with apparent Mi&s;ery. But it mu&s;t needs be a hard contention when we pretend to mo|derate the fir&s;t, becau&s;e there is &s;ome|thing within us that &s;ecretly tells us they are nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s; and the conflict mu&s;t needs be violent, when we &s;trive again&s;t our own Happi|ne&s;s. Be&s;ides, they are as natural to the Soul as Rea&s;oning, and the re&s;ult of that; and a Rea&s;onable Creature can no more be without Admiration, Love and De&s;ire, than it can be without Think|ing,
<PB N="155" REF="185">
or without the appetites of Sence; and a Man can no more &s;uppre&s;s the one by Philo&s;ophy than the other. He can no more take away Love and De&s;ire by Rea&s;oning, than he can &s;atisfie Hun|ger and Thir&s;t with a Syllogi&s;m. All that he can arrive at, is either to con|ceal tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, as he may do his Appetites, or to refu&s;e to act in con&s;e|quence of them, as he may in con&s;e|quence of Thinking, or of Sen&s;ual Ap|petites. Or la&s;tly, He may weaken the&s;e congeneal Pa&s;&s;ions by Mortificati|on, as he may do his Appetites or his Rea&s;on. For a Di&s;temper weakens the whole Man, and Mortification is a Di|&s;temper in effect at lea&s;t. But when the man is in health, and his Sences vigo|rous, and his Rea&s;on piercing, the&s;e Appetites too will be &s;trong. And the more powerful the Rea&s;on is, the &s;trong|er will be the Pa&s;&s;ions: And therefore the attempt to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e was folly in the Philo&s;ophers. For the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions are the plea&s;ure of the Soul, which can|not &s;truggle with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t felicity. The cau&s;e of their mi&s;take was this; Some of them, as for example, the <HI>Sto|icks,</HI> thought that Rea&s;on di&s;approv'd
<PB N="156" REF="186">
of the Pa&s;&s;ions, when &s;he only di&s;lik'd the Objects; whereas the <HI>Cyrenaicks</HI> on the other hand thought that Humane Nature allow'd of the Objects, when it did nothing but approve of the Pa&s;&s;i|ons.</P>
<P>And this may &s;erve to &s;hew the folly of Dei&s;m as well as it may of Philo&s;o|phy. For Dei&s;m pretending, like Phi|lo&s;ophy, to combat all the Pa&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be founded on the &s;trength of Rea|&s;on. But a Religion founded on the &s;trength of Rea&s;on, cannot be the true Religion. For the true Religion mu&s;t be &s;ent from God, for the Happine&s;s of Mankind, and of that Religion all mu&s;t be capable, as we have &s;hown above. But of a Religion founded on the &s;trength of Rea&s;on, and who&s;e proofs mu&s;t of con&s;equence be deduc'd from a long train of con&s;equences, all men are not capable, for every Religion mu&s;t have proofs, and all men are not capa|ble of the proofs of &s;uch a Religion as that. As for example: before a man can be a Dei&s;t effectually, he mu&s;t be convinc'd of the being of a God by Rea&s;on, and mu&s;t be convinc'd by the &s;ame Rea&s;on that the World is govern'd
<PB N="157" REF="187">
by God. But to be capable of the proofs that Dei&s;m gives of tho&s;e two points, a man mu&s;t either have a very &s;trong Rea|&s;on, or a very good education, whereas not &s;o much as one in forty of Mankind has either. But all are capable of the proofs of Revealed Religion: For by proving the Divinity of the Revelation, the Doctrine is proved in cour&s;e. Now the Divinity of the Revelation mu&s;t be prov'd by Miracles. But Miracles are proofs of which all men are capable, becau&s;e they &s;peak to the Pa&s;&s;ions and appeal to the Sences. Since therefore the true Religion mu&s;t be de&s;ign'd for all; and all men are capable of the proofs of Reveal'd Religion, whereas not one in forty is capable of the proofs of Dei&s;m, it follows that a Religion that is not Reveal'd cannot be the True Religion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, no Religion can be the True Religion that is in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the ends of Government. But a Reli|gion that is not de&s;ign'd for all, can ne|ver an&s;wer the ends of Government. And therefore Dei&s;m cannot be the True Religion. For there are but two things that can re&s;train mankind, and keep
<PB N="158" REF="188">
them within the power of Law; Reli|gion, and &s;en&s;e enough to know their real Intere&s;t. But we have already made it appear above, that whoever wants good &s;en&s;e cannot be re&s;train'd by Dei&s;m.</P>
<P>That Dei&s;m is in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the ends of Government, may be fur|ther plain from matter of fact; for it would be an ea&s;ie thing to convince the Reader that there never was any tole|rable Government in the World with|out a Reveal'd Religion; and that the Governments that have been mo&s;t Re|nown'd upon Earth, flouri&s;h'd with their re&s;pective Revelations, and with them decay'd, as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> did with their Prophets, the <HI>Grecians</HI> with their Oracles, and the <HI>Romans</HI> with their Di|vinations; &s;o that either the True Re|ligion can be in the World without or|der and without peace, or Dei&s;m can|not po&s;&s;ibly be the True Religion.</P>
<P>Again, either that can be the True Religion, which can contribute nothing even to the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who embrace it, or Dei&s;m cannot be the True Religion. For Dei&s;m contributes nothing at all to the Happine&s;s even of
<PB N="159" REF="189">
tho&s;e who are capable of it, becau&s;e that by combating and re&s;i&s;ting the Pa&s;&s;ions, it maintains the War of the Faculties, in&s;tead of appea&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;hewn that the De&s;ign of the True Religion mu&s;t not only be to make men Happy, but mu&s;t ef|fectually do it; that the Philo&s;ophers indeed had that De&s;ign, but blunder'd in the execution of it; and by pretend|ing either to &s;et up our Pa&s;&s;ions above our Rea&s;on, or our Rea&s;on above our Pa&s;&s;ions, only maintain'd an eternal conflict in the brea&s;ts they de&s;ign'd to ea&s;e; that the Dei&s;t does the very &s;ame thing, by his endeavours to exalt Rea|&s;on by depre&s;&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;ions. Let us now &s;hew how the Chri&s;tian Religion exalts our Rea&s;on by exalting the Pa&s;&s;i|ons, and by a plain and a &s;hort, but a mo&s;t admirable De&s;ign, re&s;tores the Har|mony of the Human Faculties, and the Felicity of the fir&s;t man.</P>
<P>For, after that Chri&s;tianity has gain'd its profe&s;&s;ors, by proving after the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple manner all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be believ'd in it; that is, by Miracles atte&s;ted by unexceptionable Witne&s;&s;es, it gains its end, which is the
<PB N="160" REF="190">
Happine&s;s of its believers, in &s;o plain, &s;o &s;ure, and &s;o &s;hort a way, that the way to Happine&s;s and the end is but one and the &s;ame thing, and differs only in Degree. <HI>Set your affections on things above, and not on things below,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Colo&s;&s;.</HI> 1. 2. That is, Do but earne&s;tly de&s;ire of God to incline your affections to him, their primitive ob|ject; Do but de&s;ire it, and he will in|cline them, and the great bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion is done, the Harmony of the Human Faculties re&s;tor'd, and the Feli|city of the fir&s;t man in &s;ome mea&s;ure at lea&s;t renew'd. Nay, the way is &s;horter and plainer even than this. For, Do but earne&s;tly de&s;ire of God to give you Charity, and he will give it, and with that give every Virtue. For, to &s;hew how plain, how &s;hort, how admirable, the De&s;ign is of this Divine Religion, Love, which is but a &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;i|on, and the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of all the Pa&s;&s;ions, comprehends all its Du|ties and all its Felicity. St <HI>Paul</HI> has given an admirable rea&s;on why it com|prehends all its Duties; for Love, &s;ays he, worketh no ill to his Neighbour, and is therefore the fulfilling of the
<PB N="161" REF="191">
Law. And that it is inclu&s;ive of all its Felicity, may be concluded from hence, that Charity gently re&s;training tho&s;e tu|multuous Pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;turb and tor|ment the mind, exalts all the plea&s;ing affections which are natural and conge|neal to the Soul, and exalts the very Rea&s;on of Mankind, by exalting tho&s;e charming Pa&s;&s;ions. For Rea&s;on being troubled no more in its Functions, by the painful conflict which it maintain'd before, is free to di&s;cern and di&s;tingui&s;h Divine Truth, and now employs the exten and &s;tretch of its power, in con|firming and augmenting the force of tho&s;e a&s;piring Pa&s;&s;ions, which, while they were directed to mortal objects, it e&s;teem'd its mortal Enemies. And as the Rea&s;on rouzes and excites the Pa&s;&s;i|ons, the Pa&s;&s;ions, as it were in a fiery vehicle, tran&s;port the Rea&s;on above Mortality, which mounting, &s;oars to the Heaven of Heavens, upon the wings of tho&s;e very affections that before re|pre&s;s'd the Noble Efforts that it made to a&s;cend the Skies.</P>
<P>And thus we have &s;een how the Chri&s;tian Religion reconciles Pa&s;&s;ion to Rea&s;on. And while the trouble&s;ome
<PB N="162" REF="192">
Virtues of Dei&s;ts and old Philo&s;ophers, are employ'd in re&s;training tho&s;e charm|ing Pa&s;&s;ions, which are &s;o natural to the Soul of man, and which, rightly di|rected, con&s;titute all its Felicity, the Cardinal Virtues of the true Religion, as Faith, and Hope and Charity, are ex|alted Pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves. And as Chri|&s;tianity confirms and cheri&s;hes all the plea&s;ing affections, which are to the Soul, as &s;o many delicious Friends, and &s;o ma|ny dear Relations, the very conver&s;ati|on of which is &s;ufficient to make it hap|py, it gently appea&s;es the tumultuous Pa&s;&s;ions, accidental unea&s;y gue&s;ts that interrupt its plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But the Chri&s;tian Religion re&s;tores the harmony of the Human Powers to a greater degree than this, and provides even a plea&s;ure of Sence that may be highly approv'd of by Rea&s;on. For though the Chri&s;tian in this life is not allowed to expect that in a Soveraign degree, yet, &s;ince there is no &s;ight &s;o charming to the Eye, and no Mu&s;ick &s;o harmonious to the Ear, as the voice and looks of tho&s;e whom we love, the Chri&s;tian Religion by commanding us, 1 Epi&s;t; of St <HI>Pet.</HI> ch. 1. v. 2. <HI>To love one</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="193">
<HI>another with a pure heart fervently,</HI> has provided in an admirable manner for the delight of tho&s;e noble Sences.</P>
<P>Thus the proofs ofChri&s;tianity are &s;hort, and plain, and its Doctrine that leads to Felicity admirably &s;hort and unperplex'd, whereas the proofs of Dei&s;m are ab&s;tru&s;e, (I mean to the People they are ab&s;tru&s;e,) and we have &s;hewn that the true Religion mu&s;t be de&s;igned for all, and the method that it takes to make us happy, tedious and vexatious. And this is extreamly re|markable, that the very morality which in Dei&s;m and in Philo&s;ophy is prov'd, at the fir&s;t perhaps with difficulty, and perhaps at the la&s;t ob&s;curely; and when it is prov'd, obey'd with pain, becau&s;e it &s;hocks all the plea&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ions which &s;o firmly inhere to the Soul, that very Morality in the Chri&s;tian Religion is clearly and ea&s;ily prov'd to all, becau&s;e the Divinity of its Revelation is clearly and ea&s;ily prov'd, and when it is prov'd is pur&s;u'd with plea&s;ure, becau&s;e it is every part of it dictated by Love, the be&s;t and &s;weete&s;t of all the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>And thus Chri&s;tianity performs in a moment, what Philo&s;ophy and Dei&s;m have for Ages in vain attempted. For God can touch the Heart in a moment,
<PB N="164" REF="194">
and a &s;hort contrition makes way for a long felicity. And the wi&s;dom of God &s;eems loudly to declare the &s;impli|city of his great de&s;ign, by the per&s;ons whom he cho&s;e to execute it. For had there been any thing perplex'd or diffi|cult in it, Men of Choice Education and great Parts, would have been cho|&s;en to expound it. But it was &s;o ea&s;ie, &s;o clear, &s;o agreeable to the Nature of Man, whether con&s;ider'd as an Individu|al, or a Member of a va&s;t Society, (for Charity, that makes the Happine&s;s of particulars, tends to the felicity of the whole community; and whereas Ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied with the re&s;training men from the doing harm, Charity, the mo&s;t active and the be&s;t natur'd of all virtues, engages him to the doing good; and there can be no &s;uch prevalent motive for the making any one happy, as be|cau&s;e we love him) the de&s;ign, I &s;ay, of this Holy Religion, is &s;o agreeable to the nature of man, that God made choice of twelve poor Fi&s;hermen, or &s;omething more vile to human regard than Fi&s;hermen, to propagate its Divine Doctrine. And to whom did they preach it? Not to Brutal Savages, as
<PB N="165" REF="195">
<HI>Orpheus</HI> did his pretended Revelation be|fore them, nor to bloody Barbarians, as <HI>Mahomet</HI> did his Fanatick Enthu&s;ia&s;m afterwards, but to the mo&s;t civiliz'd and knowing Nations of the World, when Learning was at the greate&s;t heighth a|mong&s;t them; to the Provinces of the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI> who were the mo&s;t &s;ubtle people on the Earth; to <HI>Greece</HI> the great Inventre&s;s of Arts; and to <HI>Rome</HI> the Mi&s;tre&s;s of Nations: to <HI>Rome,</HI> that with her victorious Armies, had even then, ju&s;t then &s;ubdu'd and civiliz'd the barbarous World. And twelve poor ignorant contemptible Fi&s;hermen, who were di&s;pis'd by their own Nation, and who&s;e Nation it &s;elf was almo&s;t univer|&s;ally de&s;picable, in a very &s;hort time e&s;tabli&s;h'd this Doctrine in the mid&s;t of the&s;e knowing Nations; nay, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd it without Arts, without Elo|quence, without Reputation, without Power, and downright Innocence and Simplicity prevail'd o're the &s;ubtilty of the <HI>A&s;iaticks,</HI> the vigorous lively pene|tration of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and the profound &s;olidity of the <HI>Romans.</HI> So that Know|ledge blu&s;hing was in&s;tructed by Igno|rance, and the vain efforts of all human

But what could be &s;o agreeable to the nature of a Creature compounded of the fore&s;aid Faculties, as that which reconciled tho&s;e Faculties which neither Fame nor Philo&s;ophy, Riches nor Power could ever be found to do, or how could twelve poor wretch|ed Fi&s;hermen, without education, with|out parts, comprehend what the worlds great Sages could never find out, or how could they con&s;ent again&s;t apparent in|tere&s;t in making it known to the world, if they had not been in&s;tructed and com|pell'd to act by &s;omething that was more than Human?</P>
<P>And thus we have &s;hewn, How that the De&s;ign of all Religion mu&s;t be to make men Happy, but that the True Religion mu&s;t not only de&s;ign it, but mu&s;t effectually do it.

<P>But now, as the end of every Religion mu&s;t be the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who em|brace it, &s;o the de&s;ign of every Art mu&s;t be the very &s;ame, as has been always acknowledged by all who have enquired into the Nature of Art in general, or in|to the de&s;igns of particular Arts. And as the true Religion mu&s;t not only pro|pound the Happine&s;s of its Profe&s;&s;ors, but mu&s;t really effect it, and as that alone is the true Religion, which makes the be&s;t provi&s;ion for the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it; &s;o that mu&s;t be the be&s;t and the noble&s;t Art which brings the greate&s;t Felicity with it. But as the mi|&s;ery of man proceeds from the di&s;cord and tho&s;e civil jars that are maintained within him, it follows that nothing can make him happy, but what can remove that di&s;cord, and re&s;tore the Harmony of the Human Faculties. So that that mu&s;t be the be&s;t and the noble&s;t Art, which makes the be&s;t Provi&s;ion at the

&s;ame time for the &s;atisfaction of all the Fa|culties, the Rea&s;on, the Pa&s;&s;ions, the Sences. But none of them provides in &s;uch a Sove|raign manner as Poetry, for the &s;atis|faction of the whole man together. In &s;ome of them only Rea&s;on finds its ac|count, as in Logick and Mathematicks. In &s;ome of them only Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;i|on, as in the Ancient Eloquence, and that by no means in a Soveraign degree, for &s;ometimes the Pa&s;&s;ions oppre&s;s the Rea|&s;on, and &s;ometimes Rea&s;on excludes the Pa&s;&s;ions. In others the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Sences are charm'd, while Rea&s;on finds little contentment in them. Thus Mu|&s;ick by its Harmony rai&s;es the Pa&s;&s;ions, at the &s;ame time that it plea&s;es the Ear, and Painting by its touches moves the affections, at the &s;ame time that it charms the Eye. But in a &s;ublime and accom|pli&s;h'd Poem, the Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ions and Sences are pleas'd at the &s;ame time &s;uperlatively. The Rea&s;on in the &s;ound|ne&s;s and importance of the Moral, and the greatne&s;s and ju&s;tne&s;s of an Harmo|nious de&s;ign, who&s;e parts &s;o beautiful, when they are con&s;idered &s;eparately, be|come tran&s;porting upon a view or the whole, while we are never weary of
<PB N="170" REF="200">
contemplating their exact proportion and beautiful &s;ymetry, and their &s;ecret won|derful dependance, while they are all animated by the &s;ame Spirit in order to the &s;ame end. The rea&s;on further finds its account, in the exact perpetual of Servance of Decorums, and in behold|ing it&s;elf exalted by the exaltation of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and in &s;eeing tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions in their fierce&s;t tran&s;ports, confin'd to tho&s;e bounds, which that has &s;everely pre&s;crib'd them. That the Pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t find their account in Poetry, we have endeavour'd to prove in the former part of this Treati&s;e, but we cannot forbear taking notice of this, that tho&s;e very Pa&s;&s;ions which plague and torment us in life, plea&s;e us, nay, tran&s;port us in Poe|try. That the noble &s;en&s;es find their account in an accompli&s;h'd Poem, no one who has read one, can a moment doubt. Nor <HI>Corelli</HI>'s Hand nor <HI>Syphace</HI>'s voice, could ever to a judicious ear equal the <HI>Virgilian</HI> Harmony: Which has all the Ma&s;tery, with all the Air, and all the Sweetne&s;s, with all the Force, that the mo&s;t delicate Ear can require. Tho all his Numbers are always perfect, yet he never dwells upon any; and
<PB N="171" REF="201">
they which are in them&s;elves &s;o plea&s;ing, delight us the more, becau&s;e we are im|mediately forc'd to leave them for the perfection of &s;ome different Harmony. Nor is the Eye le&s;s &s;atisfied than the Ear, For an Admirable Poet always Paints. and all his Pictures are always Beautiful: Let the real objects be never &s;o odious, let them be never &s;o dreadful, yet he is &s;ure to paint them Delightful. For, tho &s;ometimes a vigorous lively Imitation of Creatures that are in their natures noxi|ous, may be capable of giving us Ter|ror, yet Nature, by giving us a &s;ecret Intelligence that the object is not real, can turn even that Tormenting Pa&s;&s;ion to plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus Poetry, by re&s;toring the Har|mony of the Human Faculties, provides for the Happine&s;s of Mankind, better than any other Human Invention what|ever. And 'tis for this rea&s;on that it has always been &s;o highly e&s;teem'd by the greate&s;t of men. They who have arriv'd at the being Ma&s;ters of the Uni|ver&s;e, have afterwards entertain'd the Ambition of becoming Poets; and after they have acquir'd a great deal of Fame by making whole Nations mi&s;erable,
<PB N="172" REF="202">
have a&s;pir'd to the more charming glory of making mankind happy. 'Tis for this very rea&s;on, that this Delicious Art has had as many Confe&s;&s;ors, if I may be allow'd to call them &s;o, almo&s;t as Reli|gion it &s;elf. 'Tis for this very rea&s;on, that &s;o many have been willing to re|nounce all worldly greatne&s;s for it, and plea&s;ure which attends on power, and have been contented to live poor and mi&s;erable, pitied by the wi&s;e, and con|temn'd by fools, per&s;ecuted by fortune, and hated by one another.</P>
<P>For, no man leaves plea&s;ure but for greater plea&s;ure, and he who for&s;akes all the world for Poetry, mu&s;t find a Hap|pine&s;s in that, which all the world could not &s;upply him with. Poetry &s;eems to be a noble attempt of Nature, by which it endeavours to exalt it &s;elf to its happy primitive &s;tate; and he who is enter|tain'd with an accompli&s;h'd Poem, is for a time at lea&s;t re&s;tor'd to Paradice. That happy man conver&s;es boldly with Im|mortal Beings. Tran&s;ported he beholds the Gods a&s;cending and de&s;cending, and every Pa&s;&s;ion in its turn is charm'd, while that his Rea&s;on is &s;upreamly &s;atis|fied. Perpetual Harmony attends his
<PB N="173" REF="203">
Ear, his Eye perpetual Plea&s;ure. Ten thou&s;and different objects he &s;urveys, and the mo&s;t dreadful plea&s;e him. Ty|gers and Lyons he beholds like the fir&s;t Man with joy, becau&s;e like him he &s;ees them without danger. But nothing that is meerly Human can be on all &s;ides per|fect. The Delight which Poetry gives is neither perpetual, nor are all men ca|pable of it. Religion alone can provide man a plea&s;ure that is la&s;ting, as it may be univer&s;al. Poetical fire neither al|ways burns in us, nor can it always warm us, but Charity, like the &s;acred flame that was the guardian of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire, if 'tis with care maintain'd like that, becomes like that eternal.</P>
<P>But now &s;ince the de&s;ign of Poetry, and the very method of pro&s;ecuting that de&s;ign, as far as it can be humanly pro|&s;ecuted, is the &s;ame with that of the True Religion, &s;ince the very thing that they both propo&s;e is to exalt the Rea|&s;on by exalting the Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;o make Happy the whole Man by making Internal Di&s;cord cea&s;e, I appeal to any one whether Poetry mu&s;t not agree bet|ter with that Religion, who&s;e De&s;igns are the very &s;ame with it, than with Pa|gani&s;m
<PB N="174" REF="204">
or Philo&s;ophy or Dei&s;m, who&s;e De&s;igns have been &s;hewn repugnant to it. In &s;hort, when the Pagan Theo|logy was brought nearer to the Chri|&s;tian Religion, by the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Plato</HI>; as it was modelled by <HI>Vir|gil,</HI> it became the fitter for Poetry. For <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;aw with an admirable judgment, not only that the Rea&s;on mu&s;t find its account in Poetry, as well as the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Sences, but that the Rea&s;on of Mankind, in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> when Moral Philo&s;ophy got ground every day in the World, would not be &s;atisfied at &s;o ea&s;y a rate, as it was when <HI>Homer</HI> writ; or at lea&s;t that it would not long be &s;atis|fied at &s;o ea&s;y a rate; which oblig'd him to model the <HI>Grecian</HI> Revelation by the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Plato,</HI> and that got <HI>Virgil</HI> the preheminence over <HI>Homer.</HI> For &s;ince the de&s;ign of every Art is to make men happy, and that is the be&s;t and the noble&s;t Art which makes the be&s;t provi&s;ion for the happine&s;s of Man|kind, and nothing can make man &s;o happy as the reconciling him to him|&s;elf, which can be no way &s;o effectually done, as by making all the Faculties find
<PB N="175" REF="205">
their &s;atisfaction together, it follows that that mu&s;t be the noble&s;t Poetry, where the Rea&s;on, the Pa&s;&s;ions and Sences, are all of them pleas'd, and pleas'd in the highe&s;t degree together. And therefore tho we &s;hould be obliged to grant what &s;ome will pretend with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy, and which I can ne|ver believe, that the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Sences find their account in <HI>Homer</HI> better than they do in <HI>Virgil,</HI> yet &s;ince they find their account too in <HI>Virgil,</HI> in a ve|ry great degree, and Rea&s;on at the &s;ame time is &s;atisfied, whereas it is horribly &s;hock'd in <HI>Homer</HI> by the extravagance of his Theology, it follows that <HI>Virgil</HI> for that Rea&s;on is certainly to be preferred to <HI>Homer</HI>; tho this is to be &s;aid in the behalf of the latter, that he writ to the people of his own age, in which the Rea&s;on of Mankind was &s;atisfy'd at an ea&s;ier rate.</P>
<P>And therefore when I &s;ay that <HI>Virgil</HI> is to be preferr'd to <HI>Homer,</HI> I mean that he is &s;o in regard to us, becau&s;e he is capable of giving us a greater plea&s;ure than <HI>Homer,</HI> but I do not pretend at the &s;ame time that <HI>Virgil</HI> is capable of giv|ing us a greater plea&s;ure than <HI>Homer</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="206">
gave his Contemporaries. As likewi&s;e when I affirm, that the Moderns, by joyning Poetry with the True Religion, will have the Advantage of the Anci|ents, I mean only in regard to us, to whom they will give a greater plea&s;ure than the Ancients can do, but not a greater than the Ancients gave their Contemporaries. In &s;hort, if <HI>Virgil</HI> was forc'd to model his <HI>Grecian</HI> Revelation by <HI>Platoni&s;m,</HI> that he might plea&s;e more effectually even in his time, when that Revelation as yet prevail'd; I think we may very well conclude that in our time we ought to fling it out of our Poetry, when it has been for &s;o long time utter|ly exploded, and contemn'd by the very Boys. Thus the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion and the Modern Poetry can agree but very indifferently, becau&s;e the Rea&s;on is &s;hock'd by it. And if Rea&s;on is &s;hock'd by the Religion which is joyn'd with the Poe|try; by the Religion, I &s;ay, which gives the force to the Pa&s;&s;ions, as we have &s;hewn above; I would fain know how the Pa&s;&s;ions can very well find their account. I know indeed very well, that a Poet, by the force of a &s;trong Imagination, may enter into the <HI>Grecian</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="207">
Religion when he &s;ets him&s;elf to write, and tran&s;port him&s;elf to the Age and Scene of his Action; and con&s;equently may draw a great deal of advantage from the Religion of that Country, and of that Age, in order to the being mov'd; and if the Poet is extremely mov'd him|&s;elf, why they who read him mu&s;t be mov'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure too; but whe|ther the generality of Readers can be &s;o very much mov'd, as if the Pa&s;&s;ions de|riv'd their Force from a Religion that is more familiar to them, I have a great deal of rea&s;on to doubt: But if Rea&s;on cannot find its account in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion joyn'd with the Modern Poetry, much le&s;s would the Pa&s;&s;ions find their &s;atisfaction in Dei&s;m or the Ancient Phi|lo&s;ophy. The Chri&s;tian Religion alone can &s;upply a Poet with all that is Sub|lime and Maje&s;tick in Rea&s;on; all that is either &s;oft or powerful, either enga|ging or Imperious in the Pa&s;&s;ions; and with all the objects that are mo&s;t admi|rable to the &s;ences, and con&s;equently mo&s;t delightful; as &s;hall be &s;hewn at large in the following Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hew'd in the former part of this Treati&s;e that the Ancients excell'd the Moderns in the greatne&s;s of Poetry, becau&s;e they incorporated Poe|try with Religion; and we pretended to &s;hew in this Second Part, That by joyning Poetry with the true Religion, the Moderns in the main will have the advantage of the Ancients. In order to the proving which, we &s;hew'd in the fir&s;t Chapter, that the de&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian Religion was agreeable to that of Poetry; whereas the De&s;igns of Pa|gani&s;m and Dei&s;m and Philo&s;ophy were not agreeable to it. We &s;hew'd that the true De&s;ign of Poetry, as well as of the Chri&s;tian Religion, was to plea&s;e the Rea&s;on, the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Sences at the &s;ame time. For we &s;hew'd in the former part of this Treati&s;e, that Pa&s;&s;i|on, whether ordinary or Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, is the principal thing in Poetry; and no|thing is more certain than that the more

the Sences are &s;tirr'd, and the more the Rea&s;on at the &s;ame time is &s;atisfied, the more &s;trongly for the mo&s;t part the Pa&s;&s;i|ons of Rea&s;onable creatures are mov'd.</P>
<P>Now in this Chapter we pretend to &s;hew, that the true Divine Poetry has the advantage of the Pagan Poetry; that it &s;atisfies the Rea&s;on more, at the &s;ame time that it rai&s;es a &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;i|on, and that it entertains the Sences, and e&s;pecially the Eye, more delight|fully; and we pretend to give undeni|able in&s;tances of it, both from Sacred Writ, and from one of the Fathers, and from one of our own Poets.</P>

<P>And the only rea&s;on why I refu&s;e to do it, is becau&s;e it may be pretended, that the Writers in Sacred Writ had the peculiar advantage of Divine In&s;pira|tion, and that no con&s;equence can be drawn from them in the behalf of the Moderns, who pretend not to the &s;ame advantage.

<P>And thus I have endeavour'd to &s;how in the former part of this Book, that the princi|pal rea&s;on why the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns in the greatne&s;s of Poetry, was becau&s;e they incorporated Poetry with Re|ligion; and in the Second Part, That the Moderns, by joyning the Chri&s;tian Religion with Poetry will have the advantage of the Ancients; that is, that they will have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Religion that is more agree|able to the de&s;ign of Poetry than the <HI>Grecian</HI> Religion.</P>
