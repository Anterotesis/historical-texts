<HEAD>An Account of the
State of Learning
IN THE
Empire of <HI>Lilliput.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS I always had a
&s;trong Inclination
to Reading, from
the Time I fir&s;t
went to <HI>Emanuel</HI>-College
in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and had
gone through the mo&s;t valuable
<PB N="6" REF="4">
ancient Writers; during my &s;tay
in <HI>Lilliput,</HI> I was very inqui&s;itive
about the &s;tate of Learning in
that Nation, and received the
following Information upon that
Subject.</P>
<P>IN former Ages, the Govern|ment
of the I&s;land <HI>Blefu&s;cu</HI> was,
in many re&s;pects, like what we
call a Commonwealth, and for
a long time flouri&s;hed both in
Arms and Learning, whil&s;t the
<HI>Lilliputians</HI> were a barbarous
People; at this Time many ex|cellent
Books were wrote in
Oratory, Poetry, Hi&s;tory, and
Philo&s;ophy, but the <HI>Blefu&s;cudi|ans</HI>
having at length lo&s;t their
Liberties and Form of Govern|ment,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
which was changed into
an Empire, Learning decay'd a|mong&s;t
them very fa&s;t; the
fa&s;ter by rea&s;on of hot Di&s;|putes
which aro&s;e concerning
the proper manner of Dre&s;&s;ing
and Eating Eggs; and in the&s;e
the whole Studies of all the
Learned Men of that Age were
con&s;umed.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Emperor of <HI>Ble|fu&s;cu,</HI>
that he might ingratiate
him&s;elf with his People, whom
he had en&s;laved, undertook an
Expedition again&s;t the I&s;land of
<HI>Lilliput</HI>; which being then go|verned
by &s;everal petty Kings,
ignorant of the Arts of War,
was, by Degrees, &s;ubdued to the
<PB N="8" REF="6">
Empire of <HI>Blefu&s;cu.</HI> During
this Intercour&s;e between the two
Nations, the <HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI> Lan|guage
was very much changed,
by the mixture of the <HI>Lillipu|tian</HI>;
and tho&s;e Authors who
wrote in the old Language were
neglected, and under&s;tood by
very few.</P>
<P>IN proce&s;s of Time the <HI>Lil|liputians</HI>
grew weary of Sub|jection,
flung off the Foreign
Yoke, &s;et up an Emperor of
their own with great Succe&s;s,
and ever &s;ince have been a di|&s;tinct
Empire from that of <HI>Blefu&s;cu.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7">
As they were an Ingenious
People, and ble&s;&s;ed with a Race
of good Emperors, they &s;oon
excelled their Neighbours in
Learning and Arms; they got
together all the old <HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI>
Books, their Emperor founded
a <HI>Gomfla&s;tru,</HI> or Seminary, with
different Schools, to in&s;truct
their Youth in the old <HI>Blefu&s;|cudian</HI>
Language and Learning;
and from thence cho&s;e their
<HI>Nardacs, Glumglums,</HI> and <HI>Hurgos,</HI>
and the Emperors had them|&s;elves
a large Collection of
the&s;e Books in a Library belong|ing
to the Palace.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Lilliputians</HI> flou|ri&s;hed
in Politene&s;s and Litera|ture,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
for &s;ome Ages; till at
length, by the Plenty of a long
Peace, they al&s;o grew Corrupt,
gave them&s;elves up to Idlene&s;s,
Luxury, and Intriguing, and
fell into Controver&s;ies about
breaking their Eggs; the old
<HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI> Books were laid
a&s;ide, and nothing regarded but
Eggs and Politicks. The <HI>Gom|fla&s;tru</HI>
indeed continued, each
School had its <HI>Mulro,</HI> or Gover|nour
and Scholars; but the
ta&s;te of the Age being changed,
they only turned over the old
Authors to amu&s;e them&s;elves,
and enjoy'd the moderate Reve|nues
bequeathed to them by for|mer
Emperors. The pre&s;ent
Emperor indeed had endeavour'd
<PB N="11" REF="9">
to bring them into E&s;teem again,
he encrea&s;ed their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
and gave a Noble Pre&s;ent of
Books to the <HI>Gomfla&s;tru</HI>; but
having a debauched incon&s;tant
People to rule over, and be|ing
kept in continual Alarms of
Wars by his Neighbours, he
had not lei&s;ure to perfect his
good Intentions.</P>
<P>I was at this Time in his
Favour, and when He heard
that I had been inqui&s;itive a|bout
the&s;e Affairs, He very
graciou&s;ly de&s;ired me to look
into his Library, and &s;ent Or|ders
to the Keeper of it to u&s;e
me with great Re&s;pect, and to
pre&s;ent me with Five Hun|dred
<PB N="12" REF="10">
Books, &s;uch as I &s;hould
choo&s;e.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, upon a Day
appointed, I went to the Li|brary,
which I took a view of
in the &s;ame manner as I had
done of the re&s;t of the palace,
by lying down and looking in
at the Window: The Building
was ruinous, the In&s;ide du&s;ty,
the Books many in Number,
but &s;cattered about in great
Di&s;order; the Library-Keeper,
who&s;e Name is BULLUM, was
alone &s;talking amid&s;t the Rub|bi&s;h.
As &s;oon as he &s;aw my
Face at the Window, he made
his be&s;t Bow, and began his
Speech to me, which, as I was
afterwards informed, he had
<PB N="13" REF="11">
taken a great deal of Pains a|bout,
knowing me to be in the
Emperor's good Graces. Mo&s;t
part of what he &s;poke was
unintelligible to me, by a ridi|culous
Mixture of the old
<HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI> Language: And
what I did under&s;tand was
ful&s;ome Flattery, and Comple|ments
that nothing mortal could
de&s;erve.</P>
<P>THIS was very dull Enter|tainment
to a Man of my Mo|de&s;ty,
and thereupon finding
his Speech would be long, and
that he was forced to &s;train
his Voice to make me hear at
that di&s;tance; I thought it
would be a kindne&s;s to us both
<PB N="14" REF="12">
to put a &s;top to him, which
I did, returning him Thanks,
in few Words, for his great
Opinion of me, and de&s;ired to
&s;ee him the next Day, that I
might choo&s;e out the Five Hun|dred
Books which the Emperor
had given me.</P>
<P>BULLUM, as I heard after|wards,
was in great Wrath,
and loaded me with many op|probrious
Names, for refu&s;ing
to hear his Speech out, and
daring to treat a Man of his
Learning with &s;o little re&s;pect.
However, he &s;tifled his Re&s;ent|ment
a little for the pre&s;ent,
and came to me at the Time
appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13">
I DESIRED him to &s;hew
me a Catalogue of the Books,
and to give me &s;ome Account
of what they treated of, that
I might be able to make a
Choice. He replied, That he
had not troubled him&s;elf to
bring a written Catalogue, but
that he had one in his Memory,
and immediately he repeated to
me the Titles of a va&s;t Num|ber
of old <HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI> Books,
and run on with a great flu|ency
of Speech, till he was out
of Breath.</P>
<P>IT was a Pain to me to for|bear
Laughing, to hear BULLUM
&s;putter out &s;o much Jargon;
<PB N="16" REF="14">
at la&s;t I told him, That I was
not in the lea&s;t wi&s;er for what
he had &s;aid, becau&s;e I under|&s;tood
not a Syllable of the Lan|guage
he &s;poke. At that, as
he &s;tood on the Table before
me, he put out his Under-Lip&punc;
and &s;taring me full in the Face,
&s;aid, with a great deal of Con|tempt,
<HI>Not under&s;tand</HI> Blefu&s;cu|dian!
<HI>What do you under&s;tand?</HI></P>
<P>I WAS a little Di&s;compo&s;ed
at this Treatment; but not
knowing then what Intere&s;t he
had at Court, I re&s;olved to u&s;e
him Civilly; and replied, That
I under&s;tood eight or nine Lan|guages,
if there was any Merit
in that; but that none of the
<PB N="17" REF="15">
Books in his Library would be
of any U&s;e to me, that were
not written in <HI>Lilliputian. Lil|liputian!</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>I cannot re|peat
the Titles of many of them,
but I will &s;end you Five Hun|dred
in a few Days:</HI> And thus
he left me.</P>
<P>I WAS very impatient to re|ceive
this curious Pre&s;ent; but
BULLUM broke his Word; for
about this Time my Intere&s;t
at Court began to decline. I
could not prevail upon him to
deliver the Books to me: At
la&s;t, after much Importunity,
he came to me him&s;elf, atten|ded
by a Servant, with only
Five Books.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16">
I WAS &s;urprized at this, and
a&s;ked if the re&s;t were upon the
Road: He an&s;wer'd, That &s;ince
he had &s;een me la&s;t, he had
&s;pent &s;ome Days in carefully
peru&s;ing the Emperor's Orders;
that he had di&s;covered the
Word <HI>Hundred</HI> to be an In|terpolation;
and that the true
Reading was <HI>Five</HI> Books, which,
in Obedience to the Emperor,
he had brought me.</P>
<P>I HAD indeed been put off
&s;o long, that I &s;u&s;pected I
&s;hould have had none, and
therefore agreed to have the
Five Books, de&s;igning to have
made my Complaint afterwards,
<PB N="19" REF="17">
but BULLUM had another
Trick to play me. It was the
Cu&s;tom, he &s;aid, for all Stran|gers
to make him a Com|plement
in Writing, which he
de&s;ired me to comply with, and
then he would deliver the Books
to me. He had brought the
Form, which I was to tran&s;cribe
and &s;ign with my own Name.
The Words were the&s;e:</P>
<Q><P>Be it known to all Men,
That BULLUM the Great
Library-Keeper to the Empe|ror
of <HI>Lilliput,</HI> and <HI>Mulro</HI>
in the <HI>Gomfla&s;tru,</HI> is a Man
of va&s;t Erudition and Learn|ing;
all Parts of the World
ring with his Prai&s;es; and
<PB N="20" REF="18">
whil&s;t I was honoured with
his Acquaintance, he u&s;ed me
with &s;ingular Humanity.</P><P><HI>Quinbus Fle&s;trin.</HI></P></Q>
<P>OUT of an earne&s;t De&s;ire
to get Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Books,
I &s;ubmitted even to this Demand
of BULLUM, who then ordering
them to be flung down before
me, turned nimbly upon his
Heel and left me. He had
picked out for me the Five
wor&s;t Books in the Library,
according to his Judgment; but
when I came to peru&s;e them
with a Micro&s;cope, (the bigge&s;t
being a Folio about half an Inch
long) I found they were very
<PB N="21" REF="19">
Curious in their kind, but treat|ing
of Subjects that BULLUM
was not conver&s;ant in. There
was,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Collection of Poetry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An E&s;&s;ay on Humility; ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for all <HI>Lilliputians,</HI> who
are very much inclined to think
well of them&s;elves, and meanly
of others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A Di&s;&s;ertation upon <HI>Tra|mec&s;ans</HI>
and <HI>Slamec&s;ans,</HI> or High-heel'd
and Low-heel'd Shoes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. A Bundle of Controver&s;ies
concerning the primitive way of
breaking Eggs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>Blundecral,</HI> or <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters"></HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20">
THESE Books I brought &s;afe
with me to <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;ign
either to publi&s;h them, or el&s;e
to pre&s;ent them to the Univer|&s;ity
which I had once the Ho|nour
to be a Member of.</P>
<P>BUT to return to BULLUM.
I was amazed at his Behaviour
towards me, e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing
I was a <HI>Nardac,</HI> to which
Title he generally paid a pro|found
Re&s;pect. This made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
de&s;irous of getting an Account
of his Hi&s;tory and Character,
which, having &s;omething extra|ordinary
in them, I &s;hall lay be|fore
my Reader.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21">
BULLUM is a tall raw-bon'd
Man, I believe near &s;ix Inches
and an half high; from his In|fancy
he apply'd him&s;elf, with
great Indu&s;try, to the old <HI>Ble|fu&s;cudian</HI>
Language, in which he
made &s;uch a Progre&s;s, that he
almo&s;t forgot his native <HI>Lillipu|tian</HI>;
and at this Time he can
neither Write nor &s;peak two
Sentences, without a Mixture of
old <HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI>: The&s;e Qua|lifications,
joined to an undaun|ted
forward Spirit, and a few
good Friends, prevail'd with the
Emperor's Grandfather to make
him Keeper of his Library, and
a <HI>Mulro</HI> in the <HI>Gomfla&s;tru</HI>; tho'
mo&s;t Men thought him fitter to
<PB N="24" REF="22">
be one of the Royal Guards.
The&s;e Places &s;oon helped him
to Riches, and upon the Strength
of them he &s;oon began to de|&s;pi&s;e
every Body, and to be de|&s;pi&s;ed
by every Body. This en|gaged
him in many Quarrels,
which he managed in a very odd
manner; whenever he thought
him&s;elf affronted, he immediately
flung a great Book at his Ad|ver&s;ary,
and, if he could, fell'd
him to the Earth; but if his
Adver&s;ary &s;tood his Ground and
flung another Book at him,
which was &s;ometimes done with
great Violence, then he com|plain'd
to the Grand Ju&s;ticiary,
that the&s;e Affronts were de&s;igned
to the Emperor, and that he was
<PB N="25" REF="23">
&s;ingled out only as being the
Emperor's Servant. By this
Trick he got that Great Officer
to favour him, which made his
Enemies Cautious, and him In|&s;olent.</P>
<P>BULLUM attended the Court
&s;ome Years, but could not get
into an higher Po&s;t; for though
he con&s;tantly wore the Heels of
his Shoes High or Low, as the
Fa&s;hion was, yet having a long
Back and a &s;tiff Neck, he never
could, with any dexterity, creep
under the Stick, which the Em|peror
or the Chief Mini&s;ter held.
As to his dancing on the Rope,
I &s;hall &s;peak of it pre&s;ently;
but the greate&s;t Skill at that
<PB N="26" REF="24">
Art will not procure a Man a
Place at Court, without &s;ome
Agility at the Stick.</P>
<P>BULLUM, vexed at the&s;e
Di&s;appointments, withdrew from
Court, and only appeared there
upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions, at
other Times he retired to his
Po&s;t of <HI>Mulro</HI> in the <HI>Gomflatu,</HI>
there he led a gloomy &s;olitary
Life, heaped up Wealth, and
pored upon the old <HI>Blefu&s;cu|dian</HI>
Books. It might have been
expected, that from &s;o long an
Acquaintance with tho&s;e admi|rable
Writers, he &s;hould have
grown more Polite and Humane;
but his Manner was never to
regard the Sence or Subject of
<PB N="27" REF="25">
the Author, but only the Shape
of the Letters, in which he
arrived to &s;uch Perfection, that,
as I have been a&s;&s;ured, he
could tell, very near, in what
Year of the <HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI> Com|monwealth
any Book was writ|ten;
and to this, and to re|&s;toring
the old Characters that
were effaced, all his Labour
was confined.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e Points he had
wrote &s;everal Books, &s;ome in
the <HI>Blefu&s;cudian,</HI> and &s;ome in
the mixed Language; and when|ever
he had fini&s;hed a Book,
he pre&s;ented it to &s;ome Great
Man at Court, with a Panegy|rical
Oration; &s;o contrived that
<PB N="28" REF="26">
it would fit any Man in a great
Po&s;t; and the highe&s;t Bidder
had it.</P>
<P>WHILST I was in <HI>Lilliput,</HI>
he propo&s;ed to publi&s;h a new
<HI>Blundecral</HI> of <HI>Alcoran</HI>; and, that
he might do &s;omething uncom|mon,
he began at the End, and
de&s;igned to have wrote back|wards;
but the <HI>Lilliputians,</HI>
&s;ome liking the old <HI>Blundecral,</HI>
others not caring for any, gave
him no encouragement; and
therefore he de&s;i&s;ted from that
Project.</P>
<P>As this Nation was very
much divided about breaking
their Eggs, which they gene|rally
<PB N="29" REF="27">
eat in Publick once a Day,
or at lea&s;t once in Seven Days,
I de&s;ired to know how BUL|LUM
behaved him&s;elf in this
particular; and was told,
That he was thought to have
an Aver&s;ion to Eggs, for he
was never &s;een to eat any in
Publick, but once or twice in a
Year, when his Po&s;t obliged him
to it: At tho&s;e Times he gave
Orders to have them &s;erved up
to him ready Dre&s;&s;ed, and the
Shells and Whites being care|fully
taken off, he gulped up
the Yolks in a very indecent
manner, and immediately drank
a Bumper of &s;trong Liquor after
them, to wa&s;h the Ta&s;te out
<PB N="30" REF="28">
of his Mouth, and promote the
Dige&s;tion of them.</P>
<P>WHEN any one repre&s;ented
to him the ill Example of this
Practice, his An&s;wer was, That
his Mode&s;ty would not let him
devour Eggs in Publick, when
he had &s;o many Eyes upon
him; That he was not yet de|termined
at which End he ought
to break them; That the Shells
and Whites were in&s;ipid, and only
fit for Children; But for the
Eggs them&s;elves, he was &s;o far
from hating them, that he had
a Di&s;h at his own Table every
Day. But whether this was
Truth, or if they were at
his Table, whether he eat of
<PB N="31" REF="29">
them or not, I could never
learn.</P>
<P>BULLUM was always of an
haughty Mind, and, in his own
School, took a great deal of
Plea&s;ure in mimicking the Acti|ons
of the Emperor. Thus,
he got a little Stick and u&s;ed
to divert him&s;elf in &s;eeing his
Scholars leap over, and creep
under it, as he held it between
his Hands. Tho&s;e who per|formed
be&s;t, were rewarded,
&s;ometimes, with a pompous
Title in the old <HI>Blefu&s;cudian</HI>
Language, &s;ignifying, MOST
LEARNED, MOST FAMOUS,
MOST ACCOMPLISHED YOUTH,
or the like: Sometimes with
<PB N="32" REF="30">
little Sugar-Plums; and &s;ome|times
only with the Promi&s;e of
them.</P>
<P>IN dancing on the Ropes
he took great delight him&s;elf;
and this was the only Bodily
Exerci&s;e he u&s;ed. Tho&s;e who
had been Eye-witne&s;&s;es, inform|ed
me, that he could cut a
Caper very high, but that he
did it in a clum&s;y manner,
and with little delight to the
Spectators, who were in conti|nual
apprehen&s;ions of his fal|ling,
which &s;ometimes he did
very dangerou&s;ly.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved, that he
danced be&s;t in his own Hou&s;e,
<PB N="33" REF="31">
but that he never danced be|fore
the <HI>Gomfla&s;tru</HI> with Suc|ce&s;s.
When he fir&s;t came to
his Place of <HI>Mulro,</HI> he did
nothing but Dance and cut
Capers on the Ropes, for a
Year together: As this was
a new Sport in that Part of
the I&s;land, he got a great deal
of Money by it; but &s;triving
to leap higher than ordinary,
he fell off from the Rope,
broke his Head, and di&s;ordered
his Brain &s;o much, that mo&s;t
People thought it would inca|pacitate
him for his Po&s;t of
<HI>Mulro:</HI> However, at length,
he pretty well recovered; he
him&s;elf &s;ays, he is as well,
or better, than he was before
<PB N="34" REF="32">
his Fall: But his Enemies
think his Brain is &s;till affected
by it.</P>
<P>SOME Years after, the pre|&s;ent
Emperor, in a Progre&s;s
through his Dominions, came
to the <HI>Gomfla&s;tru</HI>; and BUL|LUM,
without being a&s;ked, was
re&s;olved to divert His Maje&s;ty
with his Performance on the
Strait-Rope; up he mounts, and
Capers bravely, for &s;ome time;
at la&s;t, endeavouring to &s;hew
the utmo&s;t of his Skill, in the
mid&s;t of an high Caper, he
reached out his Right-Hand too
far, which gave him a terrible
Fall.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="33">
MOST People imputed it to
his Over-reaching him&s;elf; but
he laid the Fault partly upon
the Robes he was obliged to
wear before the Emperour,
which, as he &s;aid, entangled
his Feet; and partly upon the
maliciou&s;ne&s;s of a Bye-&s;tander,
whom he accu&s;ed of pulling
the Rope a&s;ide, as he was in
the mid&s;t of his Caper: How|ever
that was, poor BULLUM
broke his Leg, and was carried
to his own Hou&s;e, where he
continued Lame above Two
Years, not being able to &s;hew
him&s;elf in Publick all that Time;
and it was thought he would
never have recovered, if the
<PB N="36" REF="34">
Emperor at la&s;t, had not taken
pity on him, and &s;ent one of
his own Surgeons to him, who
cured him immediately.</P>
<P>AFTER all the&s;e Misfor|tunes
BULLUM could not for|&s;ake
his beloved Diver&s;ion, but
as &s;oon as he was recovered,
he forgot all that was pa&s;t,
and danced again in his own
School every Day; where, by
his frequent Falls he &s;o brui&s;ed
him&s;elf, that it was believed
they would come to a Mor|tification:
Be&s;ides, he dances
&s;o long upon the &s;ame Rope,
