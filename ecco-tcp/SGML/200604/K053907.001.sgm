<HEAD>A
SICILIAN ROMANCE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the northern &s;hore of Sicily are
&s;till to be &s;een the magnificent
remains of a ca&s;tle, which formerly be|longed
to the noble hou&s;e of Mazzini.
It &s;tands in the centre of a &s;mall bay,
and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on
one &s;ide, &s;lopes towards the &s;ea, and on
the other ri&s;es into an eminence crown|ed
by dark woods. The &s;ituation is ad|mirably
beautiful and picture&s;que, and
the ruins have an air of ancient gran|deur,
which, contra&s;ted with the pre&s;ent
&s;olitude of the &s;cene, impre&s;&s;es the
traveller with awe and curio&s;ity. During
my travels abroad I vi&s;ited this &s;pot.
As I walked over the loo&s;e fragments
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of &s;tone, which lay &s;cattered through
the immen&s;e area of the fabrick, and
&s;urveyed the &s;ublimity and grandeur of
the ruins, I recurred, by a natural a&s;&s;o|ciation
of ideas, to the times when the&s;e
walls &s;tood proudly in their original
&s;plendour, when the halls were the
&s;cenes of ho&s;pitality and fe&s;tive magni|ficence,
and when they re&s;ounded with
the voices of tho&s;e whom death had long
&s;ince &s;wept from the earth. "Thus,
&s;aid I," &s;hall the pre&s;ent generation&mdash;he
who now &s;inks in mi&s;ery&mdash;and he
who now &s;wims in plea&s;ure, alike pa&s;s
away and be forgotten." My heart &s;well|ed
with the reflection; and, as I turned
from the &s;cene with a &s;igh, I fixed
my eyes upon a friar, who&s;e venerable
figure, gently bending towards the
earth, formed no unintere&s;ting object in
the picture. He ob&s;erved my emotion;
and, as my eye met his, &s;hook his head
and pointed to the ruin. "The&s;e walls,"
&s;aid he, "were once the &s;eat of luxury
<PB N="3" REF="5">
and vice. They exhibited a &s;ingular
in&s;tance of the retribution of Heaven,
and were from that period for&s;aken,
and abandoned to decay." His words
excited my curio&s;ity, and I enquired
further concerning their meaning.</P>
<P>"A &s;olemn hi&s;tory belongs to this
ca&s;tle," &s;aid he, "which is too long and
intricate for me to relate. It is, how|ever,
contained in a manu&s;cript in our
library, of which, I could, perhaps, pro|cure
you a &s;ight. A brother of our or|der,
a de&s;cendant of the noble hou&s;e of
Mazzini, collected and recorded the
mo&s;t &s;triking incidents relating to his
family, and the hi&s;tory thus formed, he
left as a legacy to our convent. If you
plea&s;e, we will walk thither."</P>
<P>I accompanied him to the convent,
and the friar introduced me to his &s;upe|rior,
a man of an intelligent mind and
benevolent heart, with whom I pa&s;&s;ed
&s;ome hours in intere&s;ting conver&s;ation.
I believe my &s;entiments plea&s;ed him;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
for by his indulgence, I was permitted
to take ab&s;tracts of the hi&s;tory before
me, which, with &s;ome further particu|lars
obtained in conver&s;ation with the
abate, I have arranged in the following
pages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the &s;ix|teenth
century, this ca&s;tle was in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ferdinand, fifth mar|quis
of Mazzini, and was for &s;ome years
the principal re&s;idence of his family.
He was a man of a voluptuous and
imperious character. To his fir&s;t wife,
he married Loui&s;a Bernini, &s;econd
daughter of the count della Salario,
a lady yet more di&s;tingui&s;hed for the
&s;weetne&s;s of her manners and the gen|tlene&s;s
of her di&s;po&s;ition, than for her
beauty. She brought the marquis
one &s;on and two daughters, who lo&s;t
their amiable mother in early child|hood.
The arrogant and impetuous cha|racter
of the marquis, operated power|fully
upon the mild and &s;u&s;ceptible na|ture
of his lady; and it was by many
per&s;ons believed, that his unkindne&s;s
and neglect put a period to her life.
<PB N="6" REF="8">
However this might be, he &s;oon after|wards
married Maria de Vellorno, a
young lady eminently beautiful, but of
a character very oppo&s;ite to that of her
predece&s;&s;or. She was a woman of infi|nite
art, devoted to plea&s;ure, and of an
unconquerable &s;pirit. The marquis,
who&s;e heart was dead to paternal ten|derne&s;s,
and who&s;e pre&s;ent lady was too
volatile to attend to dome&s;tic concerns,
committed the education of his daugh|ters
to the care of a lady, completely
qualified for the undertaking, and who
was di&s;tantly related to the late marchio|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>He quitted Mazzini &s;oon after his
&s;econd marriage, for the gaieties and
&s;plendour of Naples, whither his &s;on
accompanied him. Though naturally
of a haughty and overbearing di&s;po&s;i|tion,
he was governed by his wife. His
pa&s;&s;ions were vehement, and &s;he had the
addre&s;s to bend them to her own pur|po&s;e;
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and &s;o well to conceal her influ|ence,
that he thought him&s;elf mo&s;t in|dependent
when he was mo&s;t en&s;laved.
He paid an annual vi&s;it to the ca&s;tle of
Mazzini; but the marchione&s;s &s;eldom
attended him, and he &s;taid only to give
&s;uch general directions concerning the
education of his daughters, as his pride,
rather than his affection, &s;eemed to dic|tate.</P>
<P>Emilia, the elder, inherited much of
her mother's di&s;po&s;ition. She had a
mild and &s;weet temper, united with a
clear and comprehen&s;ive mind. Her
younger &s;i&s;ter, Julia, was of a more
lively ca&s;t. An extreme &s;en&s;ibility &s;ub|jected
her to frequent unea&s;ine&s;s; her
temper was warm, but generous; &s;he
was quickly irritated and quickly ap|pea&s;ed;
and to a reproof, however gen|tle,
the would often weep, but was never
&s;ullen. Her imagination was ardent,
and her mind early exhibited &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="8" REF="10">
of genius. It was the particular
care of madame de Menon to counter|act
tho&s;e traits in the di&s;po&s;ition of her
young pupils, which appeared inimical
to their future happine&s;s; and for this
ta&s;k &s;he had abilities which entitled her
to hope for &s;ucce&s;s. A &s;eries of early
misfortunes had entendered her heart,
without weakening the powers of her un|der&s;tanding.
In retirement &s;he had ac|quired
tranquillity, and had almo&s;t lo&s;t
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;orrows which
yet threw a &s;oft and not unplea&s;ing
&s;hade over her character. She loved
her young charge with maternal fond|ne&s;s,
and their gradual improvement
and re&s;pectful tenderne&s;s repaid all
her anxiety. Madame excelled in mu|&s;ic
and drawing. She had often forgot
her &s;orrows in the&s;e amu&s;ements, when
her mind was too much occupied to de|rive
con&s;olation from books, and &s;he was
a&s;&s;iduous to impart to Emilia and Julia
a power &s;o valuable as that of beguil|ing
<PB N="9" REF="11">
the &s;en&s;e of affliction. Emilia's
ta&s;te led her to drawing, and &s;he &s;oon
made rapid advances in that art. Julia
was uncommonly &s;u&s;ceptible of the
charms of harmony. She had feelings
which trembled in uni&s;on to all its vari|ous
and enchanting powers.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions of madame &s;he caught
with a&s;toni&s;hing quickne&s;s and in a &s;hort
time attained to a degree of excellence
in her favourite &s;tudy, which few per|&s;ons
have ever exceeded. Her manner
was entirely her own. It was not in
the rapid intricacies of execution, that
&s;he excelled &s;o much as in that deli|cacy
of ta&s;te, and in tho&s;e enchanting
powers of expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;eem to
breathe a &s;oul through the &s;ound, and
which take captive the heart of the
hearer. The lute was her favourite in|&s;trument,
and its tender notes accorded
well with the &s;weet and melting tones
of her voice.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Mazzini was a large ir|regular
<PB N="10" REF="12">
regular fabrick, and &s;eemed &s;uited to
receive a numerous train of followers,
&s;uch as, in tho&s;e days, &s;erved the nobi|lity,
either in the &s;plendour of peace, or
the turbulence of war. Its pre&s;ent fa|mily
inhabited only a &s;mall part of it;
and even this part appeared forlorn and
almo&s;t de&s;olate from the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of
the apartments, and the length of the
galleries which led to them. A melan|choly
&s;tillne&s;s reigned through the halls,
and the &s;ilence of the courts, which
were &s;haded by high turrets, was for
many hours together undi&s;turbed by
the &s;ound of any foot-&s;tep. Julia, who
di&s;covered an early ta&s;te for books,
loved to retire in an evening to a &s;mall
clo&s;et in which &s;he had collected her
favourite authors. This room formed
the we&s;tern angle of the ca&s;tle: one of
its windows looked upon the &s;ea, be|yond
which was faintly &s;een, &s;kirting
the horizon, the dark rocky coa&s;t of
Calabria; the other opened towards a
<PB N="11" REF="13">
part of the ca&s;tle, and afforded a pro&s;|pect
of the neighbouring woods. Her
mu&s;ical in&s;truments were here depo&s;it|ed,
with whatever a&s;&s;i&s;ted her favourite
amu&s;ements. This &s;pot, which was at
once elegant, plea&s;ant, and retired, was
embelli&s;hed with many little ornaments
of her own invention, and with &s;ome
drawings executed by her &s;i&s;ter. The
clo&s;et was adjoining her chamber, and
was &s;eparated from the apartments of
madame, only by a &s;hort gallery. This
gallery opened into another, long and
winding, which led to the grand &s;tair|ca&s;e,
terminating in the north hall, with
which the chief apartments of the north
&s;ide of the edifice communicated.</P>
<P>Madame de Menon's apartment open|ed
into both galleries. It was in one of
the&s;e rooms that &s;he u&s;ually &s;pent the
mornings, occupied in the improve|ment
of her young charge. The win|dows
looked towards the &s;ea, and the
room was light and plea&s;ant. It was
<PB N="12" REF="14">
their cu&s;tom to dine in one of the lower
apartments, and at table they were al|ways
joined by a dependant of the
marquis's, who had re&s;ided many years
in the ca&s;tle, and who in&s;tructed the
young ladies in the latin tongue, and
in geography. During the fine even|ings
of &s;ummer, this little party fre|quently
&s;upped in a pavillion, which
was built on an eminence in the woods
belonging to the ca&s;tle. From this &s;pot
the eye had an almo&s;t boundle&s;s range
of &s;ea and land. It commanded the
&s;traits of Me&s;&s;ina, with the oppo&s;ite
&s;hores of Calabria, and a great extent
of the wild and picture&s;que &s;cenery of
Sicily. Mount AEtna, crowned with
eternal &s;nows, and &s;hooting from among
the clouds, formed a grand and &s;ub|lime
picture in the back ground of the
&s;cene. The city of Palermo was al&s;o
di&s;tingui&s;hable; and Julia, as &s;he gaz|ed
on its glittering &s;pires, would en|deavour
in imagination to depicture its
<PB N="13" REF="15">
beauties, while &s;he &s;ecretly &s;ighed for
a view of that world, from which &s;he
had hitherto been &s;ecluded by the mean
jealou&s;y of the marchione&s;s, upon who&s;e
mind the dread of rival beauty operated
&s;trongly to the prejudice of Emilia and
Julia. She employed all her influence
over the marquis to detain them in
retirement; and, though Emilia was
now twenty, and her &s;i&s;ter eighteen,
they had never pa&s;&s;ed the boundaries
of their father's domains.</P>
<P>Vanity often produces unrea&s;onable
alarm; but the marchione&s;s had in this
in&s;tance ju&s;t grounds for apprehen&s;ion;
the beauty of her lord's daughters has
&s;eldom been exceeded. The per&s;on of
Emilia was finely proportioned. Her
complexion was fair, her hair flaxen,
and her dark blue eyes were full of
&s;weet expre&s;&s;ion. Her manners were
dignified and elegant, and in her air was
a feminine &s;oftne&s;s, a tender timidity,
which irre&s;i&s;tibly attracted the heart of
the beholder. The figure of Julia was
<PB N="14" REF="16">
light and graceful&mdash;her &s;tep was airy&mdash;her
mien animated, and her &s;mile en|chanting.
Her eyes were dark, and
full of fire, but tempered with mode&s;t
&s;weetne&s;s. Her features were finely
turned&mdash;every laughing grace played
round her mouth, and her countenance
quickly di&s;covered all the various emo|tions
of her &s;oul. The dark auburn
hair which curled in beautiful profu&s;i|on
in her neck, gave a fini&s;hing charm
to her appearance.</P>
<P>Thus lovely, and thus veiled in ob|&s;curity,
were the daughters of the no|ble
Mazzini. But they were happy, for
they knew not enough of the world &s;e|riou&s;ly
to regret the want of its enjoy|ments,
though Julia would &s;ometimes
&s;igh for the airy image which her fan|cies
painted, and a painful curio&s;ity
would ari&s;e concerning the bu&s;y &s;cenes
from which &s;he was excluded. A re|turn
to her cu&s;tomary amu&s;ements,
however, would cha&s;e the ideal image
<PB N="15" REF="17">
from her mind, and re&s;tore her u&s;ual
happy complacency. Books, mu&s;ic,
and painting, divided the hours of her
lei&s;ure, and many beautiful &s;ummer
evenings were &s;pent in the pavillion,
where the refined conver&s;ation of ma|dame,
the poetry of Ta&s;&s;o, the lute
of Julia, and the friend&s;hip of Emi|lia,
combined to form a &s;pecies of
happine&s;s, &s;uch as elevated and highly
&s;u&s;ceptible minds are alone capable of
receiving or communicating. Madame
under&s;tood and practi&s;ed all the graces
of conver&s;ation, and her young pupils
perceived its value, and caught the &s;pi|rit
of its character.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ation may be divided into
two cla&s;&s;es&mdash;the familiar and the &s;enti|mental.
It is the province of the familiar,
to diffu&s;e chearfulne&s;s and ea&s;e&mdash;to open
the heart of man to man, and to beam a
temperate &s;un&s;hine upon the mind.&mdash;Nature
and art mu&s;t con&s;pire to render
us &s;u&s;ceptible of the charms, and to
<PB N="16" REF="18">
qualify us for the practice of the &s;econd
cla&s;s of conver&s;ation, here termed &s;enti|mental,
and in which madame de Menon
particularly excelled. To good &s;en&s;e,
lively feeling, and natural delicacy of
ta&s;te, mu&s;t be united an expan&s;ion of
mind, and a refinement of thought,
which is the re&s;ult of high cultivation.
To render this &s;ort of conver&s;ation irre|&s;i&s;tibly
attractive, a knowledge of the
world is requi&s;ite, and that enchanting
ea&s;e, that elegance of manner, which is
to be acquired only by frequenting the
higher circles of poli&s;hed life. In &s;en|timental
conver&s;ation, &s;ubjects intere&s;t|ing
to the heart, and to the imagina|tion,
are brought forward; they are di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed
in a kind of &s;portive way, with
animation and refinement, and are never
continued longer than politene&s;s allows.
Here fancy flouri&s;hes,&mdash;the &s;en&s;ibilities
expand&mdash;and wit, guided by delicacy
and embelli&s;hed by ta&s;te&mdash;points to the
heart.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
Such was the conver&s;ation of madame
de Menon; and the plea&s;ant gaiety of
the pavillion &s;eemed peculiarly to adapt
it for the &s;cene of &s;ocial delights. On
the evening of a very &s;ultry day, hav|ing
&s;upped in their favourite &s;pot, the
coolne&s;s of the hour, and the beauty of
the night, tempted this happy party to
remain there later than u&s;ual. Return|ing
home, they were &s;urpri&s;ed by the
appearance of a light through the bro|ken
window-&s;hutters of an apartment,
belonging to a divi&s;ion of the ca&s;tle
which had for many years been &s;hut up.
They &s;topped to ob&s;erve it, when it
&s;uddenly di&s;appeared and was &s;een no
more. Madame de Menon, di&s;turbed
at this phaenomenon, ha&s;tened into the
ca&s;tle, with a view of enquiring into the
cau&s;e of it, when &s;he was met in the
north hall by Vincent. She related to
him what &s;he had &s;een, and ordered an
immediate &s;earch to be made for the
keys of tho&s;e apartments. She appre|hended
<PB N="18" REF="20">
that &s;ome per&s;on had penetrated
that part of the edifice with an intention
of plunder; and, di&s;daining a paltry
fear where her duty was concerned, &s;he
&s;ummoned the &s;ervants of the ca&s;tle,
with an intention of accompanying them
thither. Vincent &s;miled at her appre|hen&s;ions,
and imputed what &s;he had &s;een
to an illu&s;ion, which the &s;olemnity of
the hour had impre&s;&s;ed upon her fancy.
Madame, however, per&s;evered in her
purpo&s;e; and, after a long and repeat|ed
&s;earch, a ma&s;&s;ey key covered with
ru&s;t was produced. She then proceeded
to the &s;outhern &s;ide of the edifice, ac|companied
by Vincent, and followed
by the &s;ervants, who were agitated with
impatient wonder. The key was ap|plied
to an iron gate, which opened
into a court that &s;eparated this divi&s;ion
from the other parts of the ca&s;tle. They
entered this court, which was overgrown
with gra&s;s and weeds, and a&s;cended
&s;ome &s;teps that led to a large door,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
which they vainly endeavoured to open.
All the different keys of the ca&s;tle were
applied to the lock, without effect, and
they were at length compelled to quit
the place, without having either &s;ati&s;|fied
their curio&s;ity, or quieted their
fears. Every thing, however, was &s;till,
and the light did not re-appear. Ma|dame
concealed her apprehen&s;ions, and
the family retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance dwelt on the mind
of madame de Menon, and it was &s;ome
time before &s;he venturned again to,
&s;pend an evening in the pavillion. After
&s;everal months pa&s;&s;ed, without further
di&s;turbance or di&s;covery, another oc|currence
renewed the alarm. Julia had
one night remained in her clo&s;et later
than u&s;ual. A favourite book had en|gaged
her attention beyond the hour of
cu&s;tomary repo&s;e, and every inhabitant
of the ca&s;tle, except her&s;elf, had long
been lo&s;t in &s;leep. She was rou&s;ed from
her forgetfulne&s;s, by the found of the
<PB N="20" REF="22">
ca&s;tle clock, which &s;truck one. Sur|pri&s;ed
at the latene&s;s of the hour, &s;he
ro&s;e in ha&s;te, and was moving to her
chamber, when the beauty of the night
attracted her to the window. She open|ed
it; and ob&s;erving a fine effect of
moon-light upon the dark woods, lean|ed
forwards. In that &s;ituation &s;he had
not long remained, when &s;he perceived
a light faintly fla&s;h though a ca&s;ement
in the uninhabited part of the ca&s;tle.
A &s;udden tremor &s;eized her, and &s;he
with difficulty &s;upported her&s;elf. In a
few moments it di&s;appeared, and &s;oon
after a figure, bearing a lamp, proceed|ed
from an ob&s;cure door belonging to
the &s;outh tower; and &s;tealing along the
out&s;ide of the ca&s;tle walls, turned round
the &s;outhern angle, by which it was
afterwards hid from the view. A&s;to|ni&s;hed
and terrified at what &s;he had
&s;een, &s;he hurried to the apartment of
madame de Menon, and related the cir|cum&s;tance.
The &s;ervants were imme|diately
<PB N="21" REF="23">
rou&s;ed, and the alarm became
general. Madame aro&s;e and de&s;cended
into the north hall, where the dome&s;tics
were already a&s;&s;embled. No one could
be found of courage &s;ufficient to enter
into the courts; and the orders of ma|dame
were di&s;regarded, when oppo&s;ed
to the effects of &s;uper&s;titious terror.
She perceived that Vincent was ab&s;ent,
but as &s;he was ordering him to be called,
he entered the hall. Surpri&s;ed to find
the family thus a&s;&s;embled, he was told
the occa&s;ion. He immediately ordered
a party of the &s;ervants to attend him
round the ca&s;tle walls; and with &s;ome
reluctance, and more fear, they obeyed
him. They all returned to the hall,
without having witne&s;&s;ed any extraor|dinary
appearance; but though their
fears were not confirmed, they were by
no means di&s;&s;ipated. The appearance
of a light in a part of the ca&s;tle which
had for &s;everal years been &s;hut up, and
to which time and circum&s;tance had
<PB N="22" REF="24">
given an air of &s;ingular de&s;olation,
might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to excite
a &s;trong degree of &s;urpri&s;e and terror.
In the minds of the vulgar, any &s;pecies
of the wonderful is received with avi|dity;
and the &s;ervants did not he&s;itate
in believing the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of
the ca&s;tle to be inhabited by a &s;uper|natural
power. Too much agitated
to &s;leep, they agreed to watch for
the remainder of the night. For this
purpo&s;e they arranged them&s;elves in
the ea&s;t gallery, where they had a
view of the &s;outh tower from which
the light had i&s;&s;ued. The night, how|ever,
pa&s;&s;ed without any further di&s;turb|ance;
and the morning dawn, which
they beheld with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea|&s;ure,
di&s;&s;ipated for a while the glooms of
apprehen&s;ion. But the return of even|ing
renewed the general fear, and for
&s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights the dome&s;tics
watched the &s;outhern tower. Although
nothing remarkable was &s;een, a report
was &s;oon rai&s;ed, and believed, that the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
&s;outhern &s;ide of the ca&s;tle was haunted.
Madame de Menon, who&s;e mind was
&s;uperior to the effects of &s;uper&s;tition,
was yet di&s;turbed and perplexed, and
&s;he determined, if the light re-appeared,
to inform the marquis of the circum|&s;tance,
and reque&s;t the keys of tho&s;e
apartments.</P>
<P>The marquis, immer&s;ed in the di&s;|&s;ipations
of Naples, &s;eldom remember|ed
the ca&s;tle, or its inhabitants. His
&s;on, who had been educated under his
immediate care, was the &s;ole object of
his pride, as the marchione&s;s was that of
his affection. He loved her with ro|mantic
fondne&s;s, which &s;he repaid with
&s;eeming tenderne&s;s, and &s;ecret perfidy.
She allowed her&s;elf a free indulgence
in the mo&s;t licentious plea&s;ures, yet con|ducted
her&s;elf with an art &s;o exqui&s;ite
as to elude di&s;covery, and even &s;u&s;pici|on.
In her amours &s;he was equally in|con&s;tant
as ardent, till the young count
Hippozitus de Vereza attracted, her at|tention.
The natural ficklene&s;s of her
<PB N="24" REF="26">
di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed then to cea&s;e, and
upon him &s;he centered all her de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The count Vereza lo&s;t his father in
early childhood. He was now of age,
and had ju&s;t entered upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his e&s;tates. His per&s;on was grace|ful,
yet manly; his mind accompli&s;hed,
and his manners elegant; his counte|nance
expre&s;&s;ed a happy union of &s;pirit,
dignity, and benevolence, which form|ed
the principal traits of his character.
He had a &s;ublimity of thought, which
taught him to de&s;pi&s;e the voluptuous
vices of the Neapolitans, and led him
to higher pur&s;uits. He was the cho&s;en
and early friend of young Ferdinand,
the &s;on of the marquis, and was a fre|quent
vi&s;itor in the family. When the
marchione&s;s fir&s;t &s;aw him, &s;he treated
him with great di&s;tinction, and at length
made &s;uch advances, as neither the ho|nour
nor the inclinations of the count
permitted him to notice. He conduct|ed
him&s;elf towards her with frigid in|difference,
which &s;erved only to inflame
<PB N="25" REF="27">
the pa&s;&s;ion it was meant to chill. The
favours of the marchione&s;s had hitherto
been &s;ought with avidity, and accepted
with rapture; and the repul&s;ive in&s;en&s;i|bility
which &s;he now experienced, rou&s;|ed
all her pride, and called into action
every refinement of coquetry.</P>
<P>It was about this period that Vincent
was &s;eized with a di&s;order which in|crea&s;ed
&s;o rapidly, as in a &s;hort time to
a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t alarming appearance.
De&s;pairing of life, he de&s;ired that a me&s;|&s;enger
might be di&s;patched to inform
the marquis of his &s;ituation, and to &s;ig|nify
his earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee him before
he died. The progre&s;s of his di&s;order
defied every art of medicine, and his
vi&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s of mind &s;eemed to acce|lerate
his fate. Perceiving his la&s;t hour
approaching, he reque&s;ted to have a
confe&s;&s;or. The confe&s;&s;or was &s;hut up
with him a con&s;iderable time, and he
had already received extreme unction,
when Madame de Menon was &s;ummon|ed
to his bed &s;ide. The hand of death
<PB N="26" REF="28">
was now upon him, cold damps hung
upon his brows, and he, with difficulty,
rai&s;ed his heavy eyes to Madame as &s;he
entered the apartment. He beckoned
her towards him, and de&s;iring that no
per&s;on might be permitted to enter the
room, was for a few moments &s;ilent.
His mind appeared to labour under op|pre&s;&s;ive
remembrances; he made &s;eve|ral
attempts to &s;peak, but either re&s;olu|tion
or &s;trength failed him. At length,
giving Madame a look of unutterable
angui&s;h, "Alas, madam," &s;aid he,
"Heaven grants not the prayer of &s;uch a
wretch as I am. I mu&s;t expire long before
the marquis can arrive. Since I &s;hall
&s;ee him no more, I would impart to you
a &s;ecret which lies heavy at my heart,
and which makes my la&s;t moments
dreadful, as they are without hope." Be
comforted" &s;aid Madame, who was affect|ed
by the energy of his manner, "we are
taught to believe that forgivene&s;s is
never denied to &s;incere repentance."</P>
<P>"You, madam, are ignorant of the
<PB N="27" REF="29">
enormity of my crime, and of the &s;e|cret&mdash;the
horrid &s;ecret which labours
at my brea&s;t. My guilt is beyond re|medy
in this world, and I fear will be
without pardon in the next; I therefore
hope little from confe&s;&s;ion even to a
prie&s;t. Yet &s;ome good it is &s;till in my
power to do; let me di&s;clo&s;e to you that
&s;ecret which is &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly connected
with the &s;outhern apartments of this
ca&s;tle." "What of them!" exclaimed
Madame, with impatience. Vincent re|turned
no an&s;wer; exhau&s;ted by the ef|fort
of &s;peaking, he had fainted. Ma|dame
rung for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by proper
applications, his &s;en&s;es were recalled.
He was, however, entirely &s;peechle&s;s,
and in this &s;tate he remained till he ex|pired,
which was about an hour after
he had conver&s;ed with Madame.</P>
<P>The perplexity and a&s;toni&s;hment of
Madame, were by the late &s;cene height|ened
to a very painful degree. She
recollected the various particulars rela|tive
to the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of the
<PB N="28" REF="30">
ca&s;tle, the many years it had &s;tood un|inhabited&mdash;the
&s;ilence which had been
ob&s;erved concerning it&mdash;the appearance
of the light and the figure&mdash;the fruit|le&s;s
&s;earch for the keys, and the reports
&s;o generally believed; and thus remem|brance
pre&s;ented her with a combina|tion
of circum&s;tances, which &s;erved only
to increa&s;e her wonder, and heighten her
curio&s;ity. A veil of my&s;tery enveloped
that part of the ca&s;tle, which it now
&s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible &s;hould ever be pene|trated,
&s;ince the only per&s;on who could
have removed it, was no more.</P>
<P>The marquis arrived on the day
after that on which Vincent had ex|pired.
He came attended by &s;ervants
only, and alighted at the gates of the
ca&s;tle with an air of impatience, and a
countenance expre&s;&s;ive of &s;trong emo|tion.
Madame, with the young ladies,
received him in the hall. He ha&s;tily
&s;aluted his daughters, and pa&s;&s;ed on to
the oak parlour, de&s;iring Madame to
<PB N="29" REF="31">
follow him. She obeyed, and the mar|quis
enquired with great agitation after
Vincent. When told of his death, he
paced the room with hurried &s;teps, and
was for &s;ome time &s;ilent, at length
&s;eating him&s;elf, and &s;urveying Madame
with a &s;crutinizing eye, he a&s;ked &s;ome
que&s;tions concerning the particulars
of Vincent's death. She mentioned
his earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee the marquis,
and repeated his la&s;t words. The mar|quis
remained &s;ilent, and Madame pro|ceeded
to mention tho&s;e circum&s;tances
relative to the &s;outhern divion of the
ca&s;tle, which &s;he thought it of &s;o
much importance to di&s;cover. He
treated the affair very lightly, laughed
at her conjectures, repre&s;ented the ap|pearances
&s;he de&s;cribed as the illu&s;ions
of a weak and timid mind, and broke up
the conver&s;ation, by going to vi&s;it the
chamber of Vincent, in which he re|mained
a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>On the following day Emilia and
Julia dined with the marquis. He was
<PB N="30" REF="32">
gloomy and &s;ilent; their efforts to amu&s;e
him &s;eemed to excite di&s;plea&s;ure rather
than kindne&s;s; and when the repa&s;t was
concluded, he withdrew to his own
apartment, leaving his daughters in a
&s;tate of &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Vincent was to be interred, accord|ing
to his own de&s;ire, in the church be|longing
to the convent of St. Nicholas.
One of the &s;ervants, after receiving
&s;ome nece&s;&s;ary orders concerning the
funeral, ventured to inform the marquis
of the appearance of the lights in the
&s;outh tower. He mentioned the &s;uper|&s;titious
reports that prevailed among&s;t
the hou&s;hold, and complained that the
&s;ervants would not cro&s;s the courts after
it was dark. "And who is he that has
commi&s;&s;ioned you with this &s;tory?" &s;aid
the marquis, in a tone of di&s;plea&s;ure;
are the weak and ridiculous fancies of
women and &s;ervants to be obtruded
upon my notice? Away&mdash;appear no
more before me, till you have learned
to &s;peak what it is proper for me to
<PB N="31" REF="33">
hear." Robert withdrew aba&s;hed, and
it was &s;ome time before any per&s;on ven|tured
to renew the &s;ubject with the mar|quis.</P>
<P>The majority of young Ferdinand
now drew near, and the marquis deter|mined
to celebrate the occa&s;ion with
fe&s;tive magnificence at the ca&s;tle of
Mazzini. He therefore &s;ummoned
the marchione&s;s, and his &s;on, from Na|ples,
and very &s;plendid preparations
were ordered to be made. Emilia and,
Julia dreaded the arrival of the marchio|ne&s;s,
who&s;e influence they had long
been &s;en&s;ible of, and from who&s;e pre|&s;ence
they anticipated a painful re&s;traint.
Beneath the gentle guidance of Madame
de Menon, their hours had pa&s;&s;ed in
happy tranquillity, for they were igno|rant
alike of the &s;orrows and the plea|&s;ures
of the world. Tho&s;e did not op|pre&s;s,
and the&s;e did not inflame them.
Engaged in the pur&s;uits of knowledge,
and in the attainment of elegant accom|pli&s;hments,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
their moments flew lightly
away, and the flight of time was mark|ed
only by improvement. In Madame
was united the tenderne&s;s of the mother,
with the &s;ympathy of a friend; and they
loved her with a warm and inviolable
affection.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;ed vi&s;it of their brother,
whom they had not &s;een for &s;everal
years, gave them great plea&s;ure. Al|though
their minds retained no very
di&s;tinct remembrance of him, they look|ed
forward with eager and delightful
expectation to his virtues and his ta|lents;
and hoped to find in his com|pany,
a con&s;olation for the unea&s;ine&s;s
which the pre&s;ence of the marchione&s;s
would excite. Neither did Julia con|template
with indifference the approach|ing
fe&s;tival. A new &s;cene was now
opening to her, which her young ima|gination
painted in the warm and glow|ing
colours of delight. The near ap|proach,
of plea&s;ure frequently awakens
<PB N="33" REF="35">
the heart to emotions, which would fail
to be excited by a more remote and ab|&s;tracted
ob&s;ervance, Julia, who in the
di&s;tance, had con&s;idered the &s;plendid
gaieties of life with tranquillity, now
lingered with impatient hope through
the moments which withheld her from
their enjoyments. Emilia, who&s;e feel|ings
were le&s;s lively, and who&s;e imagi|nation
was le&s;s powerful, beheld the
approaching fe&s;tival with calm con&s;ider|ation,
and almo&s;t regretted the interrup|tion
of tho&s;e tranquil plea&s;ures, which
&s;he knew to be more congenial with
her powers and di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>In a few days the marchione&s;s arriv|ed
at the ca&s;tle. She was followed by a
numerous retinue, and accompanied by
Ferdinand, and &s;everal of the Italian
noble&s;&s;e, whom plea&s;ure attracted to her
train. Her entrance was proclaimed
by the found of mu&s;ic, and tho&s;e gates
which had long ru&s;ted on their hinges,
were thrown open to receive her. The
<PB N="34" REF="36">
courts and halls, who&s;e a&s;pect &s;o lately
expre&s;&s;ed only gloom and de&s;olation,
now &s;hone with &s;udden &s;plendor, and
echoed the &s;ounds of gaiety and glad|ne&s;s.
Julia &s;urveyed the &s;cene from an
ob&s;cure window; and as the triumphal
&s;trains filled the air, her brea&s;t throb|bed,
her heart beat quick with joy, and
&s;he lo&s;t her apprehen&s;ions from the mar|chione&s;s
in a &s;ort of wild delight hither|to
unknown to her. The arrival of the
marchione&s;s &s;eemed indeed the &s;ignal
of univer&s;al and unlimited plea&s;ure.
When the marquis came out to receive
her, the gloom that lately clouded his
countenance, broke away in &s;miles of
welcome, which the whole company
appeared to con&s;ider as invitations to
joy.</P>
<P>The tranquil heart of Emilia was not
proof again&s;t a &s;cene &s;o alluring, and
&s;he &s;ighed at the pro&s;pect, yet &s;carcely
knew why. Julia pointed out to her
&s;i&s;ter, the graceful figure of a young
<PB N="35" REF="37">
man who followed the marchione&s;s,
and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;hes that he
might be her brother. From the con|templation
of the &s;cene before them,
they were &s;ummoned to meet the mar|chione&s;s.
Julia trembled with appre|hen&s;ion,
and for a few moments wi&s;hed
the ca&s;tle was in its former &s;tate. As
they advanced through the &s;aloon, in
which they were pre&s;ented, Julia was
covered with blu&s;hes, but Emilia, tho'
equally timid, pre&s;erved her graceful
dignity. The marchione&s;s received
them with a mingled &s;mile of conde|&s;cen&s;ion
and politene&s;s, and immediately
the whole attention of the company
was attracted by their elegance and
beauty. The eager eyes of Julia &s;ought
in vain to di&s;cover her brother, of who&s;e
features &s;he had no recollection in tho&s;e
of any of the per&s;ons then pre&s;ent. At
length her father pre&s;ented him, and
&s;he perceived with a &s;igh of regret, that
he was not the youth &s;he had ob&s;erved
<PB N="36" REF="38">
from the window. He advanced with
a very engaging air, and &s;he met him
with an unfeigned welcome. His figure
was tall and maje&s;tic; he had a very
noble and &s;pirited carriage; and his
countenance expre&s;&s;ed at once &s;weet|ne&s;s
and dignity. Supper was &s;erved
in the ea&s;t hall, and the tables were
&s;pread with a profu&s;ion of delicacies.
A band of mu&s;ic played during the re|pa&s;t,
and the evening concluded with a
concert in the &s;aloon.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE day of the fe&s;tival, &s;o long and
&s;o impatiently looked for by Julia,
was now arrived. All the neighbour|ing
nobility were invited, and the gates
of the ca&s;tle were thrown open for a ge|neral
rejoicing. A magnificent enter|tainment,
con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t luxuri|ous
and expen&s;ive di&s;hes, was &s;erved
in the halls. Soft mu&s;ic floated along
the vaulted roofs, the walls were hung
with decorations, and it &s;eemed as if the
hand of a magician had &s;uddenly meta|morpho&s;ed
this once gloomy fabric into
the palace of a fairy. The marquis,
notwith&s;tanding the gaiety of the &s;cene,
frequently appeared ab&s;tracted from its
enjoyments, and in &s;pite of all his efforts
at cheerfulne&s;s, the melancholy of his
heart was vi&s;ible in his countenance.</P>
<P>In the evening there was a grand
<PB N="38" REF="40">
ball: the marchione&s;s, who was &s;till
di&s;tingui&s;hed for her beauty, and for
the winning elegance of her manners,
appeared in the mo&s;t &s;plendid attire.
Her hair was ornamented with a profu|&s;ion
of jewels, but was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to
give an air rather of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s,
than of grace, to her figure. Although
con&s;cious of her charms, &s;he beheld the
beauty of Emilia and Julia with a jea|lous
eye, and was compelled &s;ecretly to
acknowledge, that the &s;imple elegance
with which they were adorned, was
more enchanting than all the &s;tudied
artifice of &s;plendid decoration. They
were dre&s;&s;ed alike in light Sicilian
habits, and the beautiful luxuriance of
their flowing hair, was re&s;trained only
by bandellets of pearl. The ball was
opened by Ferdinand, and the lady Ma|tilda
Con&s;tanza. Emilia danced with
the young marquis della Fazelli, and
acquitted her&s;elf with the ea&s;e and dig|nity
&s;o natural to her. Julia experi|enced
<PB N="39" REF="41">
a various emotion of plea&s;ure and
fear when the count de Vereza, in whom
&s;he recollected the cavalier &s;he had ob|&s;erved
from the window, led her forth.
The grace of her &s;tep, and the elegant
&s;ymmetry of her figure, rai&s;ed in the
a&s;&s;embly a gentle murmur of applau&s;e,
and the &s;oft blu&s;h which now &s;tole over
her cheek, gave an additional charm to
her appearance. But when the mu&s;ic
changed, and &s;he danced to the &s;oft Si|cilian
mea&s;ure, the airy grace of her
movement, and the unaffected tender|ne&s;s
of her air, &s;unk attention into &s;i|lence,
which continued for &s;ome time
after the dance had cea&s;ed. The mar|chione&s;s
ob&s;erved the general admira|tion
with &s;eeming plea&s;ure, and &s;ecret
unea&s;ine&s;s. She had &s;uffered a very
painful &s;olicitude, when the count de
Vereza &s;elected her for his partner in
the dance, and &s;he pur&s;ued him through
the evening, with an eye of jealous &s;cru|tiny.
Her bo&s;om, which before glow|ed
<PB N="40" REF="42">
only with love, was now torn by the
agitation of other pa&s;&s;ions more vio|lent
and de&s;tructive. Her thoughts
were re&s;tle&s;s, her mind wandered from
the &s;cene before her, and it required all
her addre&s;s to pre&s;erve an apparent ea&s;e.
She &s;aw, or fancied &s;he &s;aw, an impa&s;|&s;ioned
air in the count, when he addre&s;&s;|ed
him&s;elf to Julia, that corroded her
heart with jealous fury.</P>
<P>At twelve the gates of the ca&s;tle were
thrown open, and the company quitted
it for the woods, which were &s;plendidly
illuminated. Arcades of light lined the
long vi&s;tas, which were terminated by
pyramids of lamps that pre&s;ented to
the eye one bright column of flame.
At irregular di&s;tances buildings were
erected, hung with variegated lamps
di&s;po&s;ed in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t fanta&s;tic
forms. Collations were &s;pread under
the trees; and mu&s;ic, touched by un&s;een
hands, breathed around. The mu&s;ici|ans
were placed in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure
<PB N="41" REF="43">
and embowered &s;pots, &s;o as to elude the
eye and &s;trike the imagination. The
&s;cene appeared enchanted. Nothing
met the eye but beauty, and romantic
&s;plendor; the ear received no &s;ounds
but tho&s;e of mirth and melody. The
younger part of the company formed
them&s;elves into groups, which at inter|vals
glanced through the woods, and
were again un&s;een. Julia &s;eemed the
magic queen of the place. Her heart
dilated with plea&s;ure, and diffu&s;ed over
her features an expre&s;&s;ion of pure and
complacent delight. A generous, frank,
and exalted &s;entiment &s;parkled in her
eyes, and animated her manner. Her
bo&s;om glowed with benevolent affec|tions;
and &s;he &s;eemed anxious to impart
to all around her, a happine&s;s as unmix|ed
as that &s;he experienced. Wherever
&s;he moved, admiration followed her
&s;teps. Ferdinand was as gay as the
&s;cene around him. Emilia was plea&s;ed;
and the marquis &s;eemed to have left his
<PB N="42" REF="44">
melancholy in the ca&s;tle. The mar|chione&s;s
alone was wretched. She &s;up|ped
with a &s;elect party, in a pavillion on
the &s;ea &s;hore, which was fitted up with
peculiar elegance. It was hung with
white &s;ilk, drawn up in fe&s;toons, and
richly fringed with gold. The &s;ofas
were of the &s;ame materials, and alter|nate
wreaths of lamps and of ro&s;es en|twined
the columns. A row of &s;mall
lamps placed about the cornice, formed
an edge of light round the roof which,
with the other numerous lights, was re|flected
in a blaze of &s;plendor from the
large mirrors that adorned the room.
The count Muriani was of the party;&mdash;he
complimented the marchione&s;s on
the beauty of her daughters; and after
lamenting with gaiety the captives
which their charms would enthral, he
mentioned the count de Vereza. "He
is certainly of all others the man mo&s;t
de&s;erving the lady Julia. As they
danced, I thought they exhibited a per|fect
<PB N="43" REF="45">
model of the beauty of either &s;ex;
and if I mi&s;take not, they are in&s;pired
with a mutual admiration." The mar|chione&s;s,
endeavouring to conceal her
unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid, "Yes, my lord, I al|low
the count all the merit you ad|judge
him, but from the little I have
&s;een of his di&s;po&s;ition, he is too volatile
for a &s;erious attachment."&mdash;At that in|&s;tant
the count entered the pavillion:
"Ah, &s;aid Muriani, laughingly, you
was the &s;ubject of our conver&s;ation, and
&s;eem to be come in good time to
receive the honours alloted you. I
was interceding with the marchione&s;s
for her intere&s;t in your favour, with the
lady Julia; but &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;es
it; and though &s;he allows you merit,
alledges, that you are by nature fickle
and incon&s;tant. What &s;ay you&mdash;would
not the beauty of lady Julia bind your
un&s;teady heart?"</P>
<P>"I know not how I have de&s;erved
that character of the marchione&s;s," &s;aid
<PB N="44" REF="46">
the count, with a &s;mile, "but that
heart mu&s;t be either fickle or insen&s;ible
in an uncommon degree, which can
boa&s;t of freedom in the pre&s;ence of lady
Julia." The marchione&s;s, morti&s;ied by
the whole conver&s;ation, now felt the
full force of Vereza's reply, which &s;he
imagined he pointed with particular
empha&s;is.</P>
<P>The entertainment concluded with a
grand firework, which was exhibited on
the margin of the &s;ea, and the company
did not part till the dawn of morning.
Julia retired from the &s;cene with regret.
She was enchanted with the new world
that was now exhibited to her, and &s;he
was not cool enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the
vivid glow of imagination from the co|lours
of real bli&s;s. The plea&s;ure &s;he
now felt, &s;he believed would always be
renewed, and in an equal degree, by the
objects which fir&s;t excited it. The
weakne&s;s of humanity is never willing|ly
perceived by young minds. It is
<PB N="45" REF="47">
painful to know, thatwe are operated
upon by objects who&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are
variable as they are indefinable&mdash;and that
what ye&s;terday affected us &s;trongly, is
to-day but imperfectly felt, and to-mor|row
perhaps &s;hall be di&s;regarded. When
at length this unwelcome truth is re|ceived
into the mind, we at fir&s;t reject,
with di&s;gu&s;t, every appearance of good,
we di&s;dain to partake of a happine&s;s
which we cannot always command, and
we not unfrequently &s;ink into a tem|porary
de&s;pair. Wi&s;dom or accident,
at length, recall us from our error, and
offers to us &s;ome object capable of pro|ducing
a plea&s;ing, yet la&s;ting effect,
which effect, therefore, we call happi|ne&s;s.
Happine&s;s has this e&s;&s;ential dif|ference
from what is commonly called
plea&s;ure; that virtue forms its ba&s;is,
and virtue being the offspring of rea&s;on,
may be expected to produce uniformity
of effect.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions which had hitherto lain
<PB N="46" REF="48">
concealed in Julia's heart, touched by
circum&s;tance, dilated to its power, and
afforded her a &s;light experience of the
pain and delight which flow from their
influence. The beauty and accom|pli&s;hments
of Vereza, rai&s;ed in her a
new and various emotion, which reflec|tion
made her fear to encourage, but
which was too plea&s;ing to be wholly re|&s;i&s;ted.
Tremblingly alive to a &s;en&s;e of
delight, and unchilled by di&s;appoint|ment,
the young heart welcomes every
feeling, not &s;imply painful, with a ro|mantic
expectation, that it will expand
into bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Julia &s;ought with eager anxiety to
di&s;cover the &s;entiments of Vereza to|wards
her; &s;he revolved each circum|&s;tance
of the day, but they afforded her
little &s;atisfaction; they reflected only a
glimmering and uncertain light, which
in&s;tead of guiding, &s;erved only to per|plex
her. Now &s;he remembered &s;ome
in&s;tance of particular attention, and then
<PB N="47" REF="49">
&s;ome mark of apparent indifference
She compared his conduct with that of
the other young noble&s;&s;e; and thought
each appeared equally de&s;irous of the
favour of every lady pre&s;ent. All the
ladies, however, appeared to her to
court the admiration of Vereza, and &s;he
trembled le&s;t he &s;hould be too &s;en&s;ible
of the di&s;tinction. She drew from the&s;e
reflections no po&s;itive inference; and
though di&s;tru&s;t rendered pain the pre|dominate
&s;en&s;ation, it was &s;o exqui&s;ite|ly
interwoven with delight, that &s;he
could not wi&s;h it exchanged for her
former ea&s;e. Thoughtful and re&s;tle&s;s,
&s;leep &s;led from her eyes, and &s;he long|ed
with impatience for the morning,
which &s;hould again pre&s;ent Vereza,
and enable her to pur&s;ue the enquiry.
She aro&s;e early, and adorned her&s;elf
with unu&s;ual care. In her favourite
clo&s;et &s;he awaited the hour of break|fa&s;t,
and endeavoured to read, but her
thoughts wandered from the &s;ubject.
<PB N="48" REF="50">
Her lute and favourite airs lo&s;t half
their power to plea&s;e; the day &s;eemed
to &s;tand &s;till&mdash;&s;he became melancholy,
and thought the breakfa&s;t hour would
never arrive. At length the clock
&s;truck the &s;ignal, the &s;ound vibrated on
every nerve, and trembling &s;he quitted
the clo&s;et for her &s;i&s;ter's apartment.
Love taught her di&s;gui&s;e. Till then
Emilia had &s;hared all her thoughts;
they now de&s;cended to the breakfa&s;t
room in &s;ilence, and Julia almo&s;t feared
to meet her eye. In the breakfa&s;t room
they were alone. Julia found it impo&s;|&s;ible
to &s;upport a conver&s;ation with
Emilia, who&s;e ob&s;ervations interrupt|ing
the cour&s;e of her thoughts, became
unintere&s;ting and tire&s;ome. She was
therefore about to retire to her clo&s;et,
when the marquis entered. His air was
haughty, and his look &s;evere. He cold|ly
&s;aluted his daughters, and they had
&s;carcely time to reply to his general
enquiries, when the marchione&s;s enter|ed,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
and the company &s;oon after a&s;&s;em|bled.
Julia, who had awaited with &s;o
painful an impatience for the moment
which &s;hould pre&s;ent Vereza to her
&s;ight, now &s;ighed that it was arrived.
She &s;carcely dared to lift her timid
eyes from the ground, and when by ac|cident
they met his, a &s;oft tremour
&s;eized her; and apprehen&s;ion le&s;t he
&s;hould di&s;cover her &s;entiments, &s;erved
only to render her confu&s;ion con&s;picu|ous.
At length a glance from the
marchione&s;s recalled her bewildered
thoughts; and other fears &s;uperceding
tho&s;e of love, her mind, by degrees, re|covered
its dignity. She could di&s;tin|gui&s;h
in the behaviour of Vereza no
&s;ymptoms of particular admiration, and
&s;he re&s;olved to conduct her&s;elf towards
him with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care.</P>
<P>This day, like the preceding one, was
devoted to joy. In the evening there
was a concert, which was chiefly per|formed
by the nobility. Ferdinand play|ed
<PB N="50" REF="52">
the violincello, Vereza the german
&s;lute, and Julia the piano forte, which
&s;he touched with a delicacy and execu|tion
that engaged every auditor. The
confu&s;ion of Julia may be ea&s;ily ima|gined,
when Ferdinand, &s;electing a
beautiful duet, de&s;ired Vereza would
accompany his &s;i&s;ter. The pride of
con&s;cious excellence, however, quickly
overcame her timidity, and enabled her
to exert all her powers. The air was
&s;imple and pathetic, and &s;he gave it
tho&s;e charms of expre&s;&s;ion &s;o peculiarly
her own. She &s;truck the chords of her
piano forte in beautiful accompani|ment,
and towards the clo&s;e of the &s;e|cond
&s;tanza, her voice re&s;ting on one
note, &s;welled into a tone &s;o exqui&s;ite,
and from thence de&s;cended to a few
&s;imple notes, which &s;he touched with
&s;uch impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s that every
eye wept to the &s;ounds. The breath of
the &s;lute trembled, and Hippolitus en|tranced,
forgot to play. A pau&s;e of
<PB N="51" REF="53">
&s;ilence en&s;ued at the conclu&s;ion of the
piece, and continued till a general &s;igh
&s;eemed to awaken the audience from
their enchantment. Amid the general
applau&s;e, Hippolitus was &s;ilent. Julia
ob&s;erved his behaviour, and gently rai&s;|ing
her eyes to his, there read the &s;en|timents
which &s;he had in&s;pired. An
exqui&s;ite emotion thrilled her heart, and
&s;he experienced one of tho&s;e rare mo|ments
which illumine life with a ray of
bli&s;s, by which the darkne&s;s of its ge|neral
&s;hade is contra&s;ted. Care, doubt,
every di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation vani&s;hed,
and for the remainder of the evening
&s;he was con&s;cious only of delight. A
timid re&s;pect marked the manner of
Hippolitus, more flattering to Julia
than the mo&s;t ardent profe&s;&s;ions. The
evening concluded with a ball, and Julia
was again the partner of the count.</P>
<P>When the ball broke up, &s;he retired
to her apartment, but not to &s;leep. Joy
is as re&s;tle&s;s as anxiety or &s;orrow. She
<PB N="52" REF="54">
&s;eemed to have entered upon a new
&s;tate of exi&s;tence;&mdash;tho&s;e fine &s;prings of
affection which had hitherto lain con|cealed,
were now touched, and yielded
to her a happine&s;s more exalted than
any her imagination had ever painted.
She reflected on the tranquillity of her
pa&s;t life, and comparing it with the emo|tions
of the pre&s;ent hour, exulted in the
difference. All her former plea&s;ures
now appeared in&s;ipid; &s;he wondered
that they ever had power to affect her,
and that &s;he had endured with content
the dull uniformity to which &s;he had
been condemned. It was now only that
&s;he appeared to live. Ab&s;orbed in the
&s;ingle idea of being beloved, her imagi|nation
&s;oared into the regions of roman|tic
bli&s;s, and bore her high above the
po&s;&s;ibility of evil. Since &s;he was be|loved
by Hippolitus, &s;he could only be
happy.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of entranced delight,
&s;he was awakened by the &s;ound of mu|&s;ic
<PB N="53" REF="55">
immediately under her window. It
was a lute touched by a ma&s;terly hand.
After a wild and melancholy &s;ymphony,
a voice of more than magic expre&s;&s;ion
&s;welled into an air &s;o pathetic and ten|der,
that it &s;eemed to breathe the very
&s;oul of love. The chords of the lute
were &s;truck in low and &s;weet accom|paniment.
Julia li&s;tened, and di&s;tingui&s;hed
the following words:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>STILL is the night-breeze!&mdash;not a lonely &s;ound</L>
<L>Steals through the &s;ilence of this dreary hour;</L>
<L>O'er the&s;e high battlements Sleep reigns profound,</L>
<L>And &s;heds on all, his &s;weet oblivious power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On all but me&mdash;I vainly a&s;k his dews</L>
<L>To &s;teep in &s;hort forgetfulne&s;s my cares.</L>
<L>Th' affrighted god &s;till flies when Love pur&s;ues,</L>
<L>Still&mdash;&s;till denies the wretched lover's prayers.</L>
</LG>
</LG>
<P>An interval of &s;ilence followed, and
the air was repeated; after which the
mu&s;ic was heard no more. If before
Julia believed that &s;he was loved by
<PB N="54" REF="56">
Hippolitus, &s;he was now confirmed in
the &s;weet reality. But &s;leep at length
fell upon her &s;en&s;es, and the airy forms
of ideal bli&s;s no longer fleeted before
her imagination. Morning came, and
&s;he aro&s;e light and refre&s;hed. How
different were her pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations
from tho&s;e of the preceding day. Her
anxiety had now evaporated in joy, and
&s;he experienced that airy dance of &s;pi|rits
which accumulates delight from
every object; and with a power like the
touch of enchantment, can transform
a gloomy de&s;ert into a &s;miling Eden.
She flew to the breakfa&s;t room, &s;carcely
con&s;cious of motion; but, as &s;he enter|ed
it, a &s;oft confu&s;ion overcame her;
&s;he blu&s;hed, and almo&s;t feared to meet
the eyes of Vereza. She was pre&s;ently
relieved, however, for the count was
not there. The company a&s;&s;embled&mdash;Julia
watched the entrance of every
per&s;on with painful anxiety, but he for
whom &s;he looked did not appear. Sur|prized
<PB N="55" REF="57">
and unea&s;y, &s;he fixed her eyes on
the door, and whenever it opened, her
heart beat with an expectation which
was as often checked by di&s;appoint|ment.
In &s;pite of all her efforts her
vivacity &s;unk into languor, and &s;he
then perceived that love may produce
other &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e of delight.
She found it po&s;&s;ible to be unhappy,
though loved by Hippolitus; and ac|knowledged
with a &s;igh of regret, which
was yet new to her, how tremblingly
her peace depended upon him. He
neither appeared nor was mentioned at
breakfa&s;t; but though delicacy prevent|ed
her enquiring after him, conver&s;ation
&s;oon became irk&s;ome to her, and &s;he
retired to the apartment of Madame de
Menon. There &s;he employed her&s;elf
in painting, and endeavoured to be|guile
the time till the hour of dinner,
when &s;he hoped to &s;ee Hippolitus.
Madame was, as u&s;ual, friendly and
cheerful, but &s;he perceived a re&s;erve in
<PB N="56" REF="58">
in the conduct of Julia, and penetrated
without difficulty into its cau&s;e. She
was, however, ignorant of the object of
her pupil's admiration. The hour &s;o
eagerly de&s;ired by Julia at length ar|rived,
and with a palpitating heart &s;he
entered the hall. The count was not
there, and in the cour&s;e of conver&s;a|tion,
&s;he learned that he had that morn|ing
&s;ailed for Naples. The &s;cene which
&s;o lately appeared enchanting to her eyes,
now changed its hue; and in the mid&s;t
of &s;ociety, and &s;urrounded by gaiety,
&s;he was &s;olitary and dejected. She ac|cu&s;ed
her&s;elf of having &s;uffered her wi&s;h|es
to mi&s;lead her judgment; and the
pre&s;ent conduct of Hippolitus convin|ced
her, that &s;he had mi&s;taken admira|tion,
for a &s;entiment more tender. She
believed too, that the mu&s;ician who
had addre&s;&s;ed her in his &s;onnet, was not
the count; and thus at once was di&s;&s;olved
all the ideal fabrick of her happine&s;s.
How &s;hort a period often rever&s;es the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
character of our &s;entiments, rendering
that which ye&s;terday we de&s;pi&s;ed, to day
de&s;irable. The tranquil &s;tate which &s;he
had &s;o lately delighted to quit, &s;he now
reflected upon with regret. She had,
however, the con&s;olation of believing
that her &s;entiments towards the count
were unknown, and the &s;weet con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
that her conduct had been govern|ed
by a nice &s;en&s;e of propriety.</P>
<P>The public rejoicings at the ca&s;tle
clo&s;ed with the week; but the gay &s;pirit
of the marchione&s;s forbade a return
to tranquillity; and &s;he &s;ub&s;tituted di|ver&s;ions
more private, but in &s;plendour
&s;carcely inferior to the preceding ones.
She had ob&s;erved the behaviour of Hip|politus
on the night of the concert with
chagrin, and his departure with &s;orrow;
yet di&s;daining to perpetuate misfortune
by reflection, &s;he &s;ought to lo&s;e the
&s;en&s;e of di&s;appointment in the hurry of
di&s;&s;ipation. But her efforts to era&s;e him
from her remembrance were ineffectual.
<PB N="58" REF="60">
Unaccu&s;tomed to oppo&s;e the bent of
her inclinations, they now maintained
unbounded &s;way; and &s;he found too
late, that in order to have a due com|mand
of our pa&s;&s;ions, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;ubject them to early obedience. Pa&s;|&s;ion,
in its undue influence, produces
weakne&s;s as well as inju&s;tice. The pain
which now recoiled upon her heart from
di&s;appointment, &s;he had not &s;trength of
mind to endure, and &s;he &s;ought relief
from its pre&s;&s;ure in afflicting the inno|cent.
Julia, who&s;e beauty &s;he ima|gined
had captivated the count, and
confirmed him in indifference towards
her&s;elf, &s;he ince&s;&s;antly tormented by
the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e various and
&s;plenetic little arts, which elude the
eye of the common ob&s;erver, and
are only to be known by tho&s;e who
have &s;elt them. Arts, which indivi|dually
are incon&s;iderable, but in the
aggregate, amount to a cruel and deci|&s;ive
effect.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">
From Julia's mind the idea of happi|ne&s;s
was now faded. Plea&s;ure had with|drawn
her beam from the pro&s;pect,
and the objects no longer illumined by
her ray, became dark and colourle&s;s.
As often as her &s;ituation would permit,
&s;he withdrew from &s;ociety, and &s;ought
the freedom of &s;olitude, where &s;he could
indulge in melancholy thoughts, and
give a loo&s;e to that de&s;pair which is &s;o
apt to follow the di&s;appointment of our
fir&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Week after week elap&s;ed, yet no
mention was made of returning to Na|ples.
The marquis at length declared
it his intention to &s;pend the remainder
of the &s;ummer in the ca&s;tle. To this
determination the marchione&s;s &s;ubmit|ted
with decent re&s;ignation, for &s;he was
here &s;urrounded by a croud of &s;latterers,
and her invention &s;upplied her with
continual diver&s;ions: that gaiety which
rendered Naples &s;o dear to her, glittered
in the woods of Mazzini, and re&s;ound|ed
through the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="62">
The apartments of Madame de Menon
were &s;pacious and noble. The windows
opened upon the &s;ea, and command|ed
a view of the &s;traits of Me&s;&s;ina,
bounded on one &s;ide by the beautiful
&s;hores of the i&s;le of Sicily, and on the
other by the high mountains of Calabria.
The &s;traits, filled with ve&s;&s;els who&s;e
gay &s;treamers glittered to the &s;un beam,
pre&s;ented to the eye an ever moving
&s;cene. The principal room opened upon
a gallery that overhung the grand ter|race
of the ca&s;tle, and it commanded a
pro&s;pect which for beauty and extent
has &s;eldom been equalled. The&s;e were
formerly con&s;idered the chief apart|ments
of the ca&s;tle; and when the mar|quis
quitted them for Naples, were al|lotted
for the re&s;idence of Madame de
Menon, and her young charge. The
marchione&s;s, &s;truck with the pro&s;pect
which the windows afforded, and with
the plea&s;antne&s;s of the gallery, deter|mined
to re&s;tore the rooms to their for|mer
<PB N="61" REF="63">
&s;plendour. She &s;ignified this inten|tion
to Madame, for whom other apart|ments
were provided. The chambers
of Emilia and Julia forming part of the
&s;uit, they were al&s;o claimed by the mar|chione&s;s,
who left Julia only her favou|rite
clo&s;et. The rooms to which they re|moved,
were &s;pacious but gloomy; they
had been for &s;ome years uninhabited;
and though preparations had been made
for the reception of their new inhabi|tants,
an air of de&s;olation reigned with|in
them that in&s;pired melancholy &s;en&s;a|tions.
Julia ob&s;erved that her cham|ber,
which opened beyond Madame's,
formed a part of the &s;outhern building,
with which, however, there appeared
no means of communication. The late
my&s;terious circum&s;tances relating to
this part of the fabric, now aro&s;e to
her imagination, and conjured up a
terror which rea&s;on could not &s;ubdue.
She told her emotions to Madame, who,
with more prudence than &s;incerity,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
laughed at her fears. The behaviour
of the marquis, the dying words of
Vincent, together with the preceding
circum&s;tances of alarm, had &s;unk deep
in the mind of Madame, but &s;he &s;aw
the nece&s;&s;ity of confining to her own
brea&s;t, doubts which time only could
re&s;olve.</P>
<P>Julia endeavoured to reconcile her|&s;elf
to the change, and a circum&s;tance
&s;oon occurred which obliterated her pre|&s;ent
&s;en&s;ations, and excited others far
more intere&s;ting. One day that &s;he was
arranging &s;ome papers in the &s;mall
drawers of a cabinet that &s;tood in her
apartment, &s;he found a picture which
fixed all her attention. It was a mi|niature
of a lady, who&s;e countenance
was touched with &s;orrow, and expre&s;&s;ed
an air of dignified re&s;ignation. The
mournful &s;weetne&s;s of her eyes, rai&s;ed
towards Heaven with a look of &s;uppli|cation,
and the melancholy languor
that &s;haded her features, &s;o deeply af|fected
<PB N="63" REF="65">
Julia, that her eyes were filled
with involuntary tears. She &s;ighed and
wept, &s;till gazing on the picture, which
&s;eemed to engage her by a kind of
fa&s;cination. She almo&s;t fancied that
the portrait breathed, and that the eyes
were fixed on her's with a look of pene|trating
&s;oftne&s;s. Full of the emotions
which the miniature had excited, &s;he
pre&s;ented it to Madame, who&s;e min|gled
&s;orrow and &s;urprize increa&s;ed her
curio&s;ity. But what where the various
&s;en&s;ations which pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart,
on learning that &s;he had wept over the
re&s;emblance of her mother! Deprived
of a mother's tenderne&s;s before &s;he
was &s;en&s;ible of its value, it was now
only that &s;he mourned the event which
lamentation could not recall. Emilia,
with an emotion as exqui&s;ite, mingled
her tears with tho&s;e of her &s;i&s;ter. With
eager impatience they pre&s;&s;ed Madame
to di&s;clo&s;e the cau&s;e of that &s;orrow
which &s;o emphatically marked the fea|tures
of their mother.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66">
"Alas! my dear children," &s;aid
Madame, deeply &s;ighing, "you en|gage
me in a ta&s;k too &s;evere, not only
for your peace, but for mine; &s;ince, in
giving you the information you require,
I mu&s;t retrace &s;cenes of my own life,
which I wi&s;h for ever obliterated. It
would, however, be both cruel and
unju&s;t to with-hold an explanation &s;o
nearly intere&s;ting to you, and I will &s;a|crifice
my own ea&s;e to your wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a de Bernini, your mother,
was as you well know the only daugh|ter
of the count de Bernini. Of the
misfortunes of your family, I be|lieve
yon are yet ignorant. The chief
e&s;tates of the count were &s;ituated in the
<HI>Val di Demona,</HI> a valley deriving its
name from its vicinity to Mount Aetna,
which vulgar tradition has peopled with
devils. In one of tho&s;e dreadful erup|tions
of Aetna, which deluged this valley
with a flood of fire, a great part of your
grandfather's domains in that quarter
<PB N="65" REF="67">
were laid wa&s;te. The count was at that
time with a part of his family at Me&s;|&s;ina,
but the counte&s;s and her &s;on, who
were in the country, were de&s;troyed.
The remaining property of the count
was proportionably incon&s;iderable, and
the lo&s;s of his wife and &s;on deeply af|fected
him. He retired with Loui&s;a,
his only &s;urviving child, who was then
near fifteen, to a &s;mall e&s;tate near Cat|tania.
There was &s;ome degree of rela|tion&s;hip
between your grandfather and
my&s;elf; and your mother was attached
to me by the ties of &s;entiment, which,
as we grew up, united us &s;till more
&s;trongly than tho&s;e of blood. Our plea|&s;ures
and our ta&s;tes were the &s;ame; and
a &s;imilarity of misfortunes might, per|haps,
contribute to cement our early
friend&s;hip. I, like her&s;elf, had lo&s;t a
parent in the eruption of Aetna. My
mother had died before I under&s;tood
her value, but my father, whom I re|vered
and tenderly loved, was de&s;troyed
<PB N="66" REF="68">
by one of tho&s;e terrible events; his
lands were buried beneath the lava, and
he left an only &s;on and my&s;elf to mourn
his fate, and encounter the evils of po|verty.
The count, who was our neare&s;t
&s;urviving relation, generou&s;ly took us
home to his hou&s;e, and declared that he
con&s;idered us as his children. To amu&s;e
his lei&s;ure hours, he undertook to fini&s;h
the education of my brother, who was
then about &s;eventeen, and who&s;e ri&s;ing
genius promi&s;ed to reward the labours
of the count. Loui&s;a and my&s;elf often
&s;hared the in&s;truction of her father, and
at tho&s;e hours Orlando was generally of
the party. The tranquil retirement of
the count's &s;ituation, the rational em|ployment
of his time between his own
&s;tudies, the education of tho&s;e whom
he called his children, and the conver|&s;ation
of a few &s;elect friends, anticipated
the effect of time, and &s;oftened the a&s;|perities
of his di&s;tre&s;s into a tender
complacent melancholy. As for Loui&s;a
<PB N="67" REF="69">
and my&s;elf, who were yet new in life,
and who&s;e &s;pirits po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the happy
ela&s;ticity of youth, our minds gradually
&s;hifted from &s;uffering to tranquillity,
and from tranquillity to happine&s;s. I have
&s;ometimes thought that when my bro|ther
has been reading to her a delightful
pa&s;&s;age, the countenance of Loui&s;a di&s;|covered
a tender intere&s;t, which &s;eem|ed
to be excited rather by the reader
than by the author. The&s;e days, which
were &s;urely the mo&s;t enviable of our
lives, now pa&s;&s;ed in &s;erene enjoyments,
and in continual gradations of improve|ment."</P>
<P>"The count de&s;igned my brother
for the army, and the time now drew
nigh when he was to join the Sicilian
regiment, in which he had a commi&s;&s;ion.
The ab&s;ent thoughts, and dejected &s;pi|rits
of my cou&s;in, now di&s;covered to
me the &s;ecret which had long been con|cealed
even from her&s;elf; for it was not

her peace. On the eve of his de|parture,
the count lamented with fa|therly,
yet manly tenderne&s;s, the di&s;|tance
which was &s;oon to &s;eparate us.
"But we &s;hall meet again," &s;aid he,
"when the honours of war &s;hall have
rewarded the bravery of my &s;on." Loui|&s;a
grew pale, a half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;igh e&s;|caped
her, and to conceal her emotion
&s;he turned to her harp&s;ichord."</P>
<P>"My brother had a favourite dog
which, before he &s;et off, he pre&s;ented
to Julia, and committing it to her care,
begged &s;he would be kind to it, and
&s;ometimes remember its ma&s;ter. He
checked his ri&s;ing emotion, but as he
turned from her, I perceived the tear
that wetted his cheek. He departed,
and with him the &s;pirit of our happi|ne&s;s
&s;eemed to evaporate. The &s;cenes
which his pre&s;ence had formerly en|livened,
were now forlorn and melan|choly,
yet we loved to wander in what
were once his favourite haunts. Loui&s;a
<PB N="69" REF="71">
forbore to mention my brother even to
me, but frequently when &s;he thought
her&s;elf unob&s;erved, &s;he would &s;teal to
her harp&s;ichord, and repeat the &s;train
which &s;he had played on the evening
before his departure."</P>
<P>"We had the plea&s;ure to hear from
time to time that he was well; and
though his own mode&s;ty threw a veil
over his conduct, we could collect
from other accounts that he had be|haved
with great bravery. At length
the time of his return approached, and
the enlivened &s;pirits of Julia declared
the influence he retained in her heart.
He returned, bearing public te&s;timony
of his valour in the honours which had
been conferred upon him. He was re|ceived
with univer&s;al joy; the count
welcomed him with the pride and fond|ne&s;s
of a father, and the villa became
again the &s;eat of happine&s;s. His per|&s;on
and manners were much improved;
the elegant beauty of the youth was
<PB N="70" REF="72">
now exchanged for the graceful dignity
of manhood, and &s;ome knowledge of
the world was added to that of the
&s;ciences. The joy which illumined
his countenance when he met Julia,
&s;poke at once his admiration and his
love; and the blu&s;h which her ob&s;erv|ation
of it brought upon her cheek,
would have di&s;covered even to an un|intere&s;ted
&s;pectator that this joy was
mutual."</P>
<P>"Orlando brought with him a young
Frenchman, a brother officer, who had
re&s;cued him from imminent danger in
battle, and whom he introduced to the
count as his pre&s;erver. The count re|ceived
him with gratitude and di&s;tinc|tion,
and he was for a con&s;iderable time
an inmate at the villa. His manners
were &s;ingularly plea&s;ing, and his under|&s;tanding
was cultivated and refined.
He &s;oon di&s;covered a partiality for me,
and he was indeed too plea&s;ing to be
&s;een with indifference. Gratitude for
<PB N="71" REF="73">
the valuable life he had pre&s;erved, was
perhaps the ground work of an e&s;teem
which &s;oon increa&s;ed into the mo&s;t af|fectionate
love. Our attachment grew
&s;tronger as our acquaintance increa&s;ed;
and at length the chevalier de Me|non
a&s;ked me of the count, who con|&s;ulted
my heart, and finding it favour|able
to the connection, proceeded to
make the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries concern|ing
the family of the &s;tranger. He ob|tained
a &s;atisfactory and plea&s;ing ac|count
of it. The chevalier was the &s;e|cond
&s;on of a French gentleman of large
e&s;tates in France, who had been &s;ome
years decea&s;ed. He had left &s;everal
&s;ons; the family e&s;tate, of cour&s;e, de|volved
to the elde&s;t, but to the two
younger he had bequeathed con&s;iderable
property. Our marriage was &s;olem|nized
in a private manner at the villa, in
the pre&s;ence of the count, Loui&s;a, and
my brother. Soon after the nuptials,
my hu&s;band and Orlando were remand|ed
<PB N="72" REF="74">
to their regiments. My brother's
affections were now unalterably fixed
upon Loui&s;a, but a &s;entiment of deli|cacy
and genero&s;ity &s;till kept him &s;ilent.
He thought, poor as he was, to &s;olicit
the hand of Loui&s;a, would be to repay
the kindne&s;s of the count with ingrati|tude.
I have &s;een the inward &s;truggles
of his heart, and mine has bled for him.
The count and Loui&s;a &s;o earne&s;tly &s;oli|cited
me to remain at the villa during
the campaign, that at length my hu&s;|band
con&s;ented. We parted&mdash;O! let
one forget that period!&mdash;Had I accom|panied
him, all might have been well;
and the long&mdash;long years of affliction
which followed had been &s;pared me."</P>
<P>The horn now &s;ounded the &s;ignal
for dinner, and interrupted the narra|tive
of Madame. Her beautious audi|tors
wiped the tears from their eyes,
and with extreme reluctance de&s;cended
to the hall. The day was occupied
with company and diver&s;ions, and it
<PB N="73" REF="75">
was not till late in the evening that
they were &s;uffered to retire. They
ha&s;tened to Madame immediately upon
their being relea&s;ed; and too much in|tere&s;ted
for &s;leep, and too importunate
to be repul&s;ed, &s;olicited the &s;equel of
her &s;tory. She objected the latene&s;s of
the hour, but at length yielded to their
entreaties. They drew their chairs clo&s;e
to her's; and every &s;en&s;e being ab&s;orb|ed
in the &s;ingle one of hearing, fol|lowed
her through the cour&s;e of her
narrative.</P>
<P>"My brother again departed with|out
di&s;clo&s;ing his &s;entiments; the effort
it co&s;t him was evident, but his &s;en&s;e
of honour &s;urmounted every oppo&s;ing
con&s;ideration. Loui&s;a again drooped,
and pined in &s;ilent &s;orrow. I lamented
equally for my friend and my brother;
and have a thou&s;and times accu&s;ed that
delicacy as fal&s;e, which with-held them
from the happine&s;s they might &s;o ea&s;ily
and &s;o innocently have obtained. The
<PB N="74" REF="76">
behaviour of the count, at lea&s;t to my
eye, &s;eemed to indicate the &s;atisfaction
which this union would have given him.
It was about this period that the mar|quis
Mazzini fir&s;t &s;aw and became ena|moured
of Loui&s;a. His propo&s;als were
very flattering, but the count forbore to
exert the undue authority of a father;
and he cea&s;ed to pre&s;s the connection,
when he perceived that Loui&s;a was really
aver&s;e to it. Loui&s;a was &s;en&s;ible of the
genero&s;ity of his conduct, and &s;he could
&s;carcely reject the alliance without a
&s;igh, which her gratitude paid to the
kindne&s;s of her father."</P>
<P>"But an event now happened which
di&s;&s;olved at once our happine&s;s, and all
our air drawn &s;chemes for futurity. A
di&s;pute, which it &s;eems originated in a
trifle, but &s;oon increa&s;ed to a &s;erious de|gree,
aro&s;e between the <HI>Chevalier de Me|non</HI>
and my brother. It was decided
by the &s;word, and my dear brother fell
by the hand of my hu&s;band. I &s;hall
<PB N="75" REF="77">
pa&s;s over this period of my life. It is
too painful for recollection. The ef|fect
of this event upon Loui&s;a was &s;uch
as may imagined. The world was now
become indifferent to her, and as &s;he
had no pro&s;pect of happine&s;s for her|&s;elf
&s;he was unwilling to with-hold it
from the father who had de&s;erved &s;o
much of her. After &s;ome time, when
the marquis renewed his addre&s;&s;es, &s;he
gave him her hand. The characters of
the marquis and his lady were in their
nature too oppo&s;ite to form a happy
union. Of this Loui&s;a was very &s;oon
&s;en&s;ible; and though the mildne&s;s of
her di&s;po&s;ition made her tamely &s;ubmit
to the unfeeling authority of her hu&s;|band,
his behaviour &s;unk deep in her
heart, and &s;he pined in &s;ecret. It was
impo&s;&s;ible for her to avoid oppo&s;ing the
character of the marquis to that of him
upon whom her affections had been &s;o
fondly and &s;o ju&s;tly fixed. The com|pari&s;on
increa&s;ed her &s;ufferings, which
<PB N="76" REF="78">
&s;oon preyed upon her con&s;titution, and
very vi&s;ibly affected her health. Her
&s;ituation deeply afflicted the count, and
united with the infirmities of age to
&s;horten his life."</P>
<P>"Upon his death, I bade adieu to
my cou&s;in, and quitted Sicily for Italy,
where the Chevalier de Menon had for
&s;ome time expected me. Our meeting
was very affecting. My re&s;entment
towards him was done away, when I
ob&s;erved his pale and altered counte|nance,
and perceived the melancholy
which preyed upon his heart. All the
airy vivacity of his former manner was
fled, and he was devoured by unavail|ing
grief and remor&s;e. He deplored
with uncea&s;ing &s;orrow the friend he
had murdered, and my pre&s;ence &s;eem|ed
to open a fre&s;h the wounds which
time had begun to clo&s;e. His afflic|tion,
united with my own, was almo&s;t
more than I could &s;upport, but I was
doomed to &s;uffer, and endure yet more.
<PB N="77" REF="79">
In a &s;ub&s;equent engagement my hu&s;|band,
weary of exi&s;tence, ru&s;hed into
the heat of battle, and there obtained
an honourable death. In a paper which
he left behind him, he &s;aid it was his
intention to die in that battle; that he
had long wi&s;hed for death, and waited
for an opportunity of obtaining it with|out
&s;taining his own character by the
cowardice of &s;uicide, or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing me
by an act of butchery. This event
gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to my afflic|tions;&mdash;yet
let me retract:&mdash;another
misfortune awaited me when I lea&s;t
expected one. The <HI>Chevalier de Menon</HI>
died without a will, and his brothers
refu&s;ed to give up his e&s;tate, unle&s;s I
could produce a witne&s;s of my mar|riage.
I returned to Sicily, and to my
inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;orrow found that your
mother had died during my &s;tay abroad,
a prey, I fear, to grief. The prie&s;t who
performed the ceremony of my mar|riage,
having been threatened with
<PB N="78" REF="80">
puni&s;hment for &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical of|fences,
had &s;ecretly left the country;
and thus was I deprived of tho&s;e proofs
which were nece&s;&s;ary to authenticate
my claims to the e&s;tates of my hu&s;band.
His brothers, to whom I was an utter
&s;tranger, were either too prejudiced to
believe, or believing, were too di&s;ho|nourable
to acknowledge the ju&s;tice of
my claims. I was therefore at once
abandoned to &s;orrow and to poverty;
a &s;mall legacy from the count de Ber|nini
being all that now remained to
me."</P>
<P>"When the marquis married Maria
de Vellorno, which was about this pe|riod,
he de&s;igned to quit Mazzini for
Naples. His &s;on was to accompany
him, but it was his intention to leave
you, who were both very young, to the
care of &s;ome per&s;on qualified to &s;uper|intend
your education. My circum|&s;tances
rendered the office acceptable,
and my former friend&s;hip for your mo|ther
<PB N="79" REF="81">
made the duty plea&s;ing to me.
The marquis, was, I believe, glad to be
&s;pared the trouble of &s;earching further
for what he had hitherto found it dif|ficult
to obtain&mdash;a per&s;on whom incli|nation
as well as duty would bind to
his intere&s;t."</P>
<P>Madame cea&s;ed to &s;peak, and Emilia
and Julia wept to the memory of the
mother, who&s;e misfortunes this &s;tory
recorded. The &s;ufferings of Madame,
together with her former friend&s;hip for
the late marchione&s;s, endeared her to
her pupils, who from this period endea|voured
by every kind and delicate at|tention
to obliterate the traces of her
&s;orrows. Madame was &s;en&s;ible of this
tenderne&s;s, and it was productive in
&s;ome degree of the effect de&s;ired. But
a &s;ubject &s;oon after occurred, which
drew off their minds from the con&s;ider|ation
of their mother's fate to a &s;ubject
more wonderful and equally intere&s;t|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">
One night that Emilia and Julia had
been detained, by company, in ceremo|nial
re&s;traint, later than u&s;ual, they were
induced by the ea&s;y conver&s;ation of Ma|dame,
and by the plea&s;ure which a re|turn
to liberty naturally produces, to
defer the hour of repo&s;e till the night
was far advanced. They were engaged
in intere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e, when Madame,
who was then &s;peaking, was interrupted
by a low hollow &s;ound, which aro&s;e from
beneath the apartment, and &s;eemed like
the clo&s;ing of a door. Chilled into a
&s;ilence, they li&s;tened and di&s;tinctly heard
it repeated. Deadly ideas crowded upon
their imaginations, and in&s;pired a terror
which &s;carcely allowed them to breathe.
The noi&s;e la&s;ted only for a moment,
and a profound &s;ilence &s;oon en&s;ued.
Their feelings at length relaxed, and
&s;uffered them to move to Madame's
apartment, when again they heard the
&s;ame &s;ounds. Almo&s;t di&s;tracted with
fear, they ru&s;hed into Madame's apart|ment,
<PB N="81" REF="83">
where Emilia &s;unk upon the bed
and fainted. It was a con&s;iderable time
ere the efforts of Madame recalled her
to &s;en&s;ation. When they were again
tranquil, &s;he employed all her endea|vours
to compo&s;e the &s;pirits of the
young ladies, and di&s;&s;uade them from
alarming the ca&s;tle. Involved in dark
and fearful doubts, &s;he yet commanded
her feelings, and endeavoured to a&s;|&s;ume
an apperance of compo&s;ure. The
late behaviour of the marquis had con|vinced
her that he was nearly connected
with the my&s;tery which hung over this
part of the edifice; and &s;he dreaded to
excite his re&s;entment by a further men|tion
of alarms, which were perhaps only
ideal, and who&s;e reality &s;he had cer|tainly
no means of proving.</P>
<P>Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations,
&s;he endeavoured to prevail on Emilia
and Julia, to await in &s;ilence &s;ome con|firmation
of their &s;urmi&s;es, but their
terror made this a very difficult ta&s;k.
<PB N="82" REF="84">
They acquie&s;ced, however, &s;o far with
her wi&s;hes, as to agree to conceal the
preceding circum&s;tances from every
per&s;on but their brother, without who&s;e
protecting pre&s;ence they declared it
utterly impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s another
night in the apartments. For the re|mainder
of this night they re&s;olved to
watch. To beguile the tediou&s;ne&s;s of
the time they endeavoured to conver&s;e,
but the minds of Emilia and Julia were
too much affected by the late occur|rence
to wander from the &s;ubject. They
compared this with the foregoing cir|cum&s;tance
of the figure and the light
which had appeared; their imaginati|ons
kindled wild conjectures, and they
&s;ubmitted their opinions to Madame,
entreating her to inform them &s;incerely,
whether &s;he believed that di&s;embodied
&s;pirits were ever permitted to vi&s;it this
earth.</P>
<P>"My children," &s;aid &s;he, "I will
not attempt to per&s;uade you that the
<PB N="83" REF="85">
exi&s;tence of &s;uch &s;pirits is impo&s;&s;ible.
Who &s;hall &s;ay that any thing is impo&s;|&s;ible
to God? We know that he has
made us, who are embodied &s;pirits; he,
therefore, can make unembodied &s;pi|rits.
If we cannot under&s;tand how &s;uch
&s;pirits exi&s;t, we &s;hould con&s;ider the li|mited
powers of our minds, and that
we can not under&s;tand many things
which are indi&s;putably true. No one
yet knows why the magnetic needle
points to the north; yet you, who have
never &s;een a magnet, do not he&s;itate to
believe that it has this tendency, be|cau&s;e
you have been well a&s;&s;ured of it,
both from books and in conver&s;ation.
Since, therefore, we are &s;ure that no|thing
is impo&s;&s;ible to God, and that
&s;uch beings <HI>may</HI> exi&s;t, though we can
not tell how, we ought to con&s;ider by
what evidence their exi&s;tence is &s;up|ported.
I do not &s;ay that &s;pirits <HI>have</HI>
appeared; but if &s;everal di&s;creet unpre|judiced
per&s;ons were to a&s;&s;ure me that
<PB N="84" REF="86">
they had &s;een one, I &s;hould not to be
proud or bold enough to reply&mdash;"it is
impo&s;&s;ible." Let not, however, &s;uch
con&s;iderations di&s;turb your minds. I
have &s;aid thus much, becau&s;e I was un|willing
to impo&s;e upon your under&s;tand|ings;
it is now your part to exerci&s;e
your rea&s;on, and pre&s;erve the unmoved
confidence of virtue. Such &s;pirits, if
indeed they have ever been &s;een, can
have appeared only by the expre&s;s per|mi&s;&s;ion
of God, and for &s;ome very &s;in|gular
purpo&s;es; be a&s;&s;ured that there
are no beings who act un&s;een by him;
and that, therefore, there are none from
whom innocence can ever &s;uffer harm."</P>
<P>No further &s;ounds di&s;turbed them for
that time; and before the morning
dawned, wearine&s;s in&s;en&s;ibly overcame
apprehen&s;ion, and &s;unk them in repo&s;e.</P>
<P>When Ferdinand learned the circum|&s;tances
relating to the &s;outhern &s;ide of
the ca&s;tle, his imagination &s;eized with
avidity each appearance of my&s;tery,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
and in&s;pired him with an irre&s;i&s;tible de|&s;ire
to penetrate the &s;ecrets of this de&s;o|late
part of the fabrick. He very rea|dily
con&s;ented to watch with his &s;i&s;ters
in Julia's apartment; but as his cham|ber
was in a remote part of the ca&s;tle,
there would be &s;ome difficulty in pa&s;|&s;ing
unob&s;erved to her's. It was agreed,
however, that when all was hu&s;hed, he
&s;hould make the attempt. Having thus
re&s;olved, Emilia and Julia waited the
return of night with re&s;tle&s;s and fear|ful
impatience.</P>
<P>At length the family retired to re&s;t.
The ca&s;tle clock had &s;truck one, and
Julia began to fear that Ferdinand had
been di&s;covered, when a knocking was
heard at the door of the outer chamber.</P>
<P>Her heart beat with apprehen&s;ions,
which rea&s;on could not ju&s;tify. Ma|dame
ro&s;e, and enquiring who was there,
was an&s;wered by the voice of Ferdinand.
The door was chearfully opened. They
drew their chairs round him, and en|deavoured
<PB N="86" REF="88">
to pa&s;s the time in conver&s;a|tion;
but fear and expectation attracted
all their thoughts to one &s;ubject, and
Madame alone pre&s;erved her compo|&s;ure.
The hour was now come when
the &s;ounds had been heard the preced|ing
night, and every ear was given to
attention. All, however, remained
quiet, and the night pa&s;&s;ed without any
new alarm.</P>
<P>The greater part of &s;everal &s;ucceed|ing
nights were &s;pent in watching, but
no &s;ounds di&s;turbed their &s;ilence. Fer|dinand,
in who&s;e mind the late circum|&s;tances
had excited a degree of a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and curio&s;ity &s;uperior to common
ob&s;tacles, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to
gain admittance to tho&s;e rece&s;&s;es of the
ca&s;tle which had for &s;o many years
been hid from human eye. This, how|ever,
was a de&s;ign which he &s;aw little
probability of accompli&s;hing, for the
keys of that part of the edifice were in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the marquis, of who&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="89">
late conduct he judged too well to be|lieve
he would &s;uffer the apartments to
be explored. He racked his invention
for the means of getting acce&s;s to them,
and at length recollecting that Julia's
chamber formed a part of the&s;e build|ings,
it occurred to him, that according
to the mode of building in old times,
there might formerly have been a com|munication
between them. This con|&s;ideration
&s;ugge&s;ted to him the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of a concealed door in her apart|ment,
and he determined to &s;urvey it
on the following night with great care.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;tle was buried in &s;leep when
Ferdinand again joined his &s;i&s;ters
in Madame's apartment. With anxious
curio&s;ity they followed him to the
chamber. The room was hung with
tape&s;try. Ferdinand carefully &s;ounded
the wall which communicated with
the &s;outhern buildings. From one part
of it a &s;ound was returned, which con|vinced
him there was &s;omething le&s;s
&s;olid than &s;tone. He removed the ta|pe&s;try,
and behind it appeared, to his
inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, a &s;mall door.
With a hand trembling through eager|ne&s;s,
he undrew the bolts, and was
ru&s;hing forward, when he perceived
that a lock with-held his pa&s;&s;age. The
keys of Madame and his &s;i&s;ters were
applied in vain, and he was compelled
to &s;ubmit to di&s;appointment at the very
moment when he congratulated him|&s;elf
<PB N="89" REF="91">
on &s;ucce&s;s, for he had with him no
means of forcing the door.</P>
<P>He &s;tood gazing on the door, and
inwardly lamenting, when a low hollow
&s;ound was heard from beneath. Emilia
and Julia &s;eized his arm; and almo&s;t
&s;inking with apprehen&s;ion, li&s;tened in
profound &s;ilence. A foot&s;tep was di&s;|tinctly
heard, as if pa&s;&s;ing through the
apartment below, after which all was
&s;till. Ferdinand fired by this confirma|tion
of the late report, ru&s;hed on to the
door, and again tried to bur&s;t his way,
but it re&s;i&s;ted all the efforts of his
&s;trength. The ladies now rejoiced in
that circum&s;tance which they &s;o lately
lamented; for the &s;ounds had renewed
their terror, and though the night
pa&s;&s;ed without further di&s;turbance, their
fears were very little abated.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, who&s;e mind was wholly
occupied with wonder, could with dif|ficulty
await the return of night. Emi|lia
and Julia were &s;carcely le&s;s impati|ent.
<PB N="90" REF="92">
They counted the minutes as they
pa&s;&s;ed; and when the family retired to
re&s;t, ha&s;tened with palpitating hearts to
the apartment of Madame. They were
&s;oon after joined by Ferdinand, who
brought with him tools for cutting away
the lock of the door. They pau&s;ed a
few moments in the chamber in fear|ful
&s;ilence, but no &s;ound di&s;turbed the
&s;tillne&s;s of night. Ferdinand applied a
knife to the door, and in a &s;hort time &s;e|parated
the lock. The door yielded,
and di&s;clo&s;ed a large and gloomy gal|lery.
He took a light. Emilia and
Julia, fearful of remaining in the cham|ber,
re&s;olved to accompany him, and
each &s;eizing an arm of Madame, they
followed in &s;ilence. The gallery was
in many parts falling to decay, the ceil|ing
was broke, and the window &s;hutters
&s;hattered, which, together with the
dampne&s;s of the walls, gave the place
an air of wild de&s;olation.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed lightly on, for their &s;teps
<PB N="91" REF="93">
ran in whi&s;pering echos through the
gallery, and often did Julia ca&s;t a fear|ful
glance around.</P>
<P>The gallery terminated in a large old
&s;tair-ca&s;e, which led to a hall below;
on the left appeared &s;everal doors which
&s;eemed to lead to &s;eparate apartments.
While they he&s;itated which cour&s;e to
pur&s;ue, a light fla&s;hed faintly up the
&s;tair-ca&s;e, and in a moment after pa&s;&s;ed
away; at the &s;ame time was heard the
&s;ound of a di&s;tant foot&s;tep. Ferdinand
drew his &s;word and &s;prang forward; his
companions &s;creaming with terror, ran
back to Madame's apartment.</P>
<P>Ferdinand de&s;cended a large vaulted
hall; he cro&s;&s;ed it towards a low arched
door which was left half open, and
through which &s;treamed a ray of light.
The door opened upon a narrow winding
pa&s;&s;age; he entered, and the light re|tiring,
was quickly lo&s;t in the windings
of the place. Still he went on. The
pa&s;&s;age grew narrower, and the frequent
<PB N="92" REF="94">
fragments of loo&s;e &s;tone, made it now
difficult to proceed. A low door clo&s;ed
the avenue, re&s;embling that by which
he had entered. He opened it, and di&s;|covered
a &s;quare room, from whence
ro&s;e a winding &s;tair-ca&s;e, which led up
the &s;outh tower of the ca&s;tle. Ferdi|nand
pau&s;ed to li&s;ten; the &s;ound of
&s;teps was cea&s;ed, and all was profoundly
&s;ilent. A door on the right attracted
his notice; he tried to open it, but it was
fa&s;tened. He concluded, therefore,
that the per&s;on, if indeed a human be|ing
it was that bore the light he had
&s;een, had pa&s;&s;ed up the tower. After a
momentary he&s;itation, he determined to
a&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e, but its ruinous
condition made this an adventure of
&s;ome difficulty. The &s;teps were decay|ed
and broken, and the loo&s;ene&s;s of the
&s;tones rendered a footing very in&s;ecure.
Impelled by an irre&s;i&s;tible curio&s;ity, he
was undi&s;mayed and began the a&s;cent.
He had not proceeded very far, when the
<PB N="93" REF="95">
&s;tones of a &s;tep which his foot had ju&s;t
quitted, loo&s;ened by his weight, gave
way; and draging with them tho&s;e ad|joining,
formed a cha&s;m in the &s;tair|ca&s;e
that terrified even Ferdinand, who
was left tottering on the &s;u&s;pended half
of the &s;teps, in momentary expectation
of falling to the bottom with the &s;tone
on which he re&s;ted. In the terror which
this occa&s;ioned, he attempted to &s;ave
him&s;elf by catching at a kind of beam
which projected over the &s;tairs, when
the lamp dropped from his hand, and he
was left in total darkne&s;s. Terror now
u&s;urped the place of every other inter|e&s;t,
and he was utterly perplexed how
to proceed. He feared to go on, le&s;t the
&s;teps above, as infirm as tho&s;e below,
&s;hould yield to his weight;&mdash;to return
was impracticable, for the darkne&s;s pre|cluded
the po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;covering a
means. He determined, therefore, to
remain in this &s;ituation till light &s;hould
dawn through the narrow grates in the
<PB N="94" REF="96">
walls, and enable him to contrive &s;ome
method of letting him&s;elf down to the
ground.</P>
<P>He had remained here above an hour,
when he &s;uddenly heard a voice from
below. It &s;eemed to come from the
pa&s;&s;age leading to the tower, and per|ceptibly
drew nearer. His agitation
was now extreme, for he had no power
of defending him&s;elf, and while he re|mained
in the &s;tate of torturing expec|tation,
a blaze of light bur&s;t upon the
&s;tair-ca&s;e beneath him. In the &s;ucceed|ing
moment he heard his own name
&s;ounded from below. His apprehen|&s;ions
in&s;tantly vani&s;hed, for he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the voices of Madame and his
&s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>They had awaited his return in all
the horrors of apprehen&s;ion, till at
length all fear for them&s;elves was lo&s;t
in their concern for him; and they, who
&s;o lately had not dared to enter this part
of the edifice, now undauntedly &s;earch|ed
it in que&s;t of Ferdinand. What
<PB N="95" REF="97">
were their emotions when they di&s;|covered
his perilous &s;ituation!</P>
<P>The light now enabled him to take
a more accurate &s;urvey of the place.
He perceived that &s;ome few &s;tones of
the &s;teps which had fallen, &s;till remain|ed
attached to the wall, but he feared
to trust to their &s;upport only. He  ob|&s;erved,
however, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> it&s;elf
was partly decayed, and con&s;equently
rugged with the corners of hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> worn
&s;tones. On the&s;e &s;mall projections he
contrived, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;teps
already mentioned, to &s;u&s;pend him&s;elf,
and at length gained the unbroken part
of the &s;tairs in &s;afety. It is difficult to
determine which individual of the party
rejoiced mo&s;t at this e&s;cape. The morn|ing
now dawned, and Ferdinand de&s;i&s;t|ed
for the pre&s;ent from farther enquiry.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t which the&s;e my&s;terious
circum&s;tances excited in the mind of
Julia, had with-drawn her attention
from a &s;ubject more dangerous to its
peace. The image of Vereza, notwith|&s;tanding,
<PB N="96" REF="98">
would frequently intrude upon
her fancy; and awakening the recol|lection
of happy emotions, would call
forth a &s;igh which all her efforts could
not &s;uppre&s;s. She loved to indulge the
melancholy of her heart in the &s;olitude
of the woods. One evening &s;he took
her lute to a favourite &s;pot on the &s;ea
&s;hore, and re&s;igning her&s;elf to a plea&s;ing
&s;adne&s;s, touched &s;ome &s;weet and plain|tive
airs. The purple flu&s;h of evening
was diffu&s;ed over the heavens. The
&s;un, involved in clouds of &s;plendid and
innumerable hues, was &s;etting o'er the
di&s;tant waters, who&s;e clear bo&s;om glow|ed
with rich reflection. The beauty of
the &s;cene, the &s;oothing murmur of the
high trees, waved by the light air
which over&s;hadowed her, and the &s;oft
&s;helling of the waves that flowed gently
in upon the &s;hores, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;unk her
mind into a &s;tate of repo&s;e. She touch|ed
the chords of her lute in &s;weet and
wild melody, and &s;ung the following ode:</P>
<LG>
<PB N="97" REF="99">

<P>Having cea&s;ed to &s;ing, her fingers
wandered over the lute in melancholy
&s;ymphony, and for &s;ome moments &s;he
remained lo&s;t in the &s;weet &s;en&s;ations
which the mu&s;ic and the &s;cenery had
in&s;pired. She was awakened from her
reverie, by a &s;igh that &s;tole from among
the trees, and directing her eyes whence
it came, beheld&mdash;Hippolitus! A thou|&s;and
<PB N="99" REF="101">
&s;and &s;weet and mingled emotions pre&s;&s;|ed
upon her heart, yet &s;he &s;carcely dar|ed
to tru&s;t the evidence of &s;ight. He
advanced, and throwing him&s;elf at her
feet. "Suffer me" &s;aid he, in a tre|mulous
voice, "to di&s;clo&s;e to you the
&s;entiments which you have in&s;pired,
and to offer you the effu&s;ions of a heart
filled only with love and admiration."
"Ri&s;e my lord," &s;aid Julia, moving
from her &s;eat with an air of dignity,
"that attitude is neither becoming
you to u&s;e, or me to &s;uffer. The even|ing
is clo&s;ing, and Ferdinand will be
impatient to &s;ee you."</P>
<P>"Never will I ri&s;e, Madam," replied
the count, with an impa&s;&s;ioned air,
"till"&mdash;He was interrupted by the
marchione&s;s, who at this moment en|tered
the grove. On ob&s;erving the po|&s;ition
of the count &s;he was retiring.
"Stay Madam," &s;aid Julia, almo&s;t
&s;inking under her confu&s;ion. "By no
<PB N="100" REF="102">
means," replied the marchione&s;s in a
tone of irony, "my pre&s;ence would
only interrupt a very agreeable &s;cene.
The count, I &s;ee, is willing to pay you
his earlie&s;t re&s;pects." Saying this &s;he
di&s;appeared, leaving Julia di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
and offended, and the count provoked
at the intru&s;ion. He attempted to re|new
the &s;ubject, but Julia ha&s;tily fol|lowed
the &s;teps of the marchione&s;s, and
entered the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, rai&s;ed
in the marchione&s;s a tumult of dread|ful
emotions. Love, hatred, and jea|lou&s;y,
raged by turns in her heart, and
defied all power of controul. Subject|ed
to their alternate violence, &s;he expe|rienced
a mi&s;ery more acute than any
&s;he had yet known. Her imagination,
invigorated by oppo&s;ition, heightened to
her the graces of Hippolitus; her bo&s;om
glowed with more inten&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, and
her brain was at length exa&s;perated
almo&s;t to madne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103">
In Julia this &s;udden and unexpected
interview excited a mingled emotion
of love and vexation, which did not
&s;oon &s;ub&s;ide. At length, however,
the delightful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Vereza's
love bore her high above every other
&s;en&s;ation; again the &s;cene more brightly
glowed, and again her fancy overcame
the po&s;&s;ibility of evil.</P>
<P>During the evening, a tender and
timid re&s;pect di&s;tingui&s;hed the behavi|our
of the count towards Julia, who,
contented with the certainty of being
loved, re&s;olved to conceal her &s;enti|ments
till an explanation of his abrupt
departure from Mazzini, and &s;ub&s;e|quent
ab&s;ence, &s;hould have di&s;&s;ipated
the &s;hadow of my&s;tery which hung over
this part of his conduct. She ob&s;erved
that the marchione&s;s pur&s;ued her with
&s;teady and con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, and &s;he
carefully avoided affording the count an
opportunity of renewing the &s;ubject of
the preceding interview, which when|ever
<PB N="102" REF="104">
he approached her &s;eemed to trem|ble
on his lips.</P>
<P>Night returned, and Ferdinand re|paired
to the chamber of Julia to pur|&s;ue
his enquiry. Here he had not long
remained, when the &s;trange and alarm|ing
&s;ounds which had been heard on
the preceding night were repeated.
The circum&s;tance that now &s;unk in ter|ror
the minds of Emilia and Julia, fired
with new wonder that of Ferdinand,
who &s;eizing a light, darted through the
di&s;covered door, and almo&s;t in&s;tantly
di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>He de&s;cended into the &s;ame wild
hall he had pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding
night. He had &s;carcely reached the
bottom of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, when a feeble
light gleamed acro&s;s the hall, and his eye
caught the glimp&s;e of a figure retiring
through the low arched door which led
to the &s;outh tower. He drew his &s;word
and ru&s;hed on. A faint found died
away along the pa&s;&s;age, the windings of
<PB N="103" REF="105">
which prevented his &s;eeing the figure
he pur&s;ued. Of this, indeed, he had
obtained &s;o &s;light a view, that he &s;carce|ly
knew whether it bore the impre&s;&s;ion
of a human form. The light quickly
di&s;appeared, and he heard the door that
opened upon the tower &s;uddenly clo&s;e.
He reached it, and forcing it open,
&s;prang forward; but the place was dark
and &s;olitary, and there was no appear|ance
of any per&s;on having pa&s;&s;ed along
it. He looked up the tower, and the
cha&s;m which the &s;tair-ca&s;e exhibited,
convinced him that no human being
could have pa&s;&s;ed up. He &s;tood &s;ilent
and amazed; examining the place
with an eye of &s;trict enquiry, he per|ceived
a door, which was partly con|cealed
by hanging &s;tairs, and which
till now had e&s;caped his notice. Hope
invigorated curio&s;ity, but his expecta|tion
was quickly di&s;appointed, for this
door al&s;o was fa&s;tened. He tried in
vain to force it. He knocked, and a
<PB N="104" REF="106">
hollow &s;ullen &s;ound ran in echoes
through the place, and died away at
di&s;tance. It was evident that beyond
this door were chambers of con&s;iderable
extent, but after long and various at|tempts
to reach them, he was obliged
to de&s;i&s;t, and he quitted the tower as
ignorant and more di&s;&s;atisfied than he
had entered it. He returned to the
hall, which he now for the fir&s;t time de|liberately
&s;urveyed. It was a &s;pacious
and de&s;olate apartment, who&s;e lofty
roof ro&s;e into arches &s;upported by pil|lars
of black marble. The &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance
inlaid the floor, and formed the
&s;tair-cafe. The windows were high
and gothic. An air of proud &s;ublimity,
united with &s;ingular wildne&s;s, charac|terized
the place, at the extremity of
which aro&s;e &s;everal gothic arches, who&s;e
dark &s;hade veiled in ob&s;curity the ex|tent
beyond. On the left hand appear|ed
two doors, each of which was fa&s;ten|ed,
and on the right the grand en|trance
<PB N="105" REF="107">
from the courts. Ferdinand de|termined
to explore the dark rece&s;s
which terminated his view, and as he
traver&s;ed the hall, his imagination, af|fected
by the &s;urrounding &s;cene, often
multiplied the echoes of his foot&s;teps
into uncertain &s;ounds of &s;trange and fear|ful
import.</P>
<P>He reached the arches, and di&s;cover|ed
beyond a kind of inner hall of con&s;i|derable
extent, which was clo&s;ed at the
farther end by a pair of ma&s;&s;y folding
doors, heavily ornamented with carving.
They were fa&s;tened by a lock, and de|fied
his utmo&s;t &s;trength.</P>
<P>As he &s;urveyed the place in &s;ilent
wonder, a &s;ullen groan aro&s;e from be|neath
the &s;pot where he &s;tood. His
blood ran cold at the &s;ound, but &s;ilence
returning, and continuing unbroken, he
attributed his alarm to the illu&s;ion of a
fancy, which terror had impregnated.
He made another effort to force the
door, when a groan was repeated more,
<PB N="106" REF="108">
hollow, and more dreadful than the fir&s;t.
At this moment all his courage for&s;ook
him, he quitted the door, and ha&s;tened
to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, which he a&s;cended al|mo&s;t
breathle&s;s with terror.</P>
<P>He found Madame de Menon and
his &s;i&s;ters awaiting his return in the mo&s;t
painful anxiety; and, thus di&s;appoint|ed
in all his endeavours to penetrate
the &s;ecret of the&s;e buildings, and fa|tigued
with fruitle&s;s &s;earch, he re&s;olved
to &s;u&s;pend farther enquiry.</P>
<P>When he related the circum&s;tances
of his late adventure, the terror of Emi|lia
and Julia was heightened to a de|gree
that overcame every prudent con&s;i|deration.
Their apprehen&s;ion of the mar|quis's
di&s;plea&s;ure, was lo&s;t in a &s;trong|er
feeling, and they re&s;olved no longer
to remain in apartments which offered
only terrific images to their fancy. Ma|dame
de Menon almo&s;t equally alarm|ed,
and more perplexed, by this combi|nation
of &s;trange and unaccountable
<PB N="107" REF="109">
circum&s;tances, cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e their
de&s;ign. It was re&s;olved, therefore, that
on the following day, Madame &s;hould
acquaint the marchione&s;s with &s;uch par|ticulars
of the late occurrences as their
purpo&s;e made it nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould
know, concealing their knowledge of
the hidden door, and the incidents im|mediately
dependant on it; and that
Madame &s;hould entreat a change of
apartments.</P>
<P>Madame accordingly waited on the
marchione&s;s. The marchione&s;s having
li&s;tened to the account at fir&s;t with fur|prize,
and afterwards with indifference,
conde&s;cended to reprove Madame for
encouraging &s;uper&s;titious belief in the
minds of her young charge. She con|cluded
with ridiculing as fanciful the
circum&s;tances related, and with refu|&s;ing,
on account of the numerous vi&s;i|tants
at the ca&s;tle, the reque&s;t preferred
to her.</P>
<P>It is true the ca&s;tle was crowded with
<PB N="108" REF="110">
vi&s;itors; the former apartments of Ma|dame
de Menon were the only ones un|occupied,
and the&s;e were in magnificent
preparation for the plea&s;ure of the mar|chione&s;s,
who was unaccu&s;tomed to &s;a|crifice
her own wi&s;hes to the comfort of
tho&s;e around her. She therefore treat|ed
lightly the &s;ubject, which, &s;eriou&s;ly
attended to, would have endangered
her new plan of delight.</P>
<P>But Emilia and Julia were too &s;eriou&s;ly
terrified to obey the &s;cruples of deli|cacy,
or to be ea&s;ily repul&s;ed. They
prevailed on Ferdinand to repre&s;ent
their &s;ituation to the marquis.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Hippolitus, who had pa&s;&s;|ed
the night in a &s;tate of &s;leeple&s;s anx|iety,
watched with bu&s;y impatience,
an opportunity of more fully di&s;clo&s;ing
to Julia, the pa&s;&s;ion which glowed in
his heart. The fir&s;t moment in which
he beheld her, had awakened in him
an admiration which had &s;ince ripened
into a &s;entiment more tender. He had
<PB N="109" REF="111">
been prevented formally declaring his
pa&s;&s;ion by the circum&s;tance which &s;o
&s;uddenly called him to Naples. This
was the dangerous illne&s;s of the mar|quis
de Lomelli, his near and much
valued relation. But it was a ta&s;k too
painful to depart in &s;ilence, and he con|trived
to inform Julia of his &s;entiments
in the air which &s;he heard &s;o &s;weetly &s;ung
beneath her window.</P>
<P>When Hippolitus reached Naples
the marquis was yet living, but expir|ed
a few days after his arrival, leaving
the count heir to the &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
which remained from the extravagance
of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of adju&s;ting his rights
had till now detained him from Sicily,
whither he came for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of
declaring his love. Here unexpected
ob&s;tacles awaited him. The jealous
vigilance of the marchione&s;s, con&s;pired
with the delicacy of Julia, to with-hold
from him the opportunity he &s;o anxi|ou&s;ly
&s;ought.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">
When Ferdinand entered upon the
&s;ubject of the &s;outhern buildings to the
marquis, he carefully avoided mention|ing
the hidden door. The marquis
li&s;tened for &s;ome time to the relation in
gloomy &s;ilence, but at length a&s;&s;uming
an air of di&s;plea&s;ure, reprehended Fer|dinand
for yielding his confidence to
tho&s;e idle alarms, which he &s;aid were
the &s;ugge&s;tions of a timid imagination.
"Alarms," continued he, "which
will readily find admittance to the
weak mind of a woman, but which the
firmer nature of man &s;hould di&s;dain.
Degenerate boy! Is it thus you reward
my care? Do I live to &s;ee my &s;on the
&s;port of every idle tale a woman may
repeat? Learn to tru&s;t rea&s;on and your
&s;en&s;es, and you will then be worthy of
my attention."</P>
<P>The marquis was retiring, and Fer|dinand
now perceived it nece&s;&s;ary to de|clare,
that he had him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed the
&s;ounds he mentioned. "Pardon me,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
my lord," &s;aid he, "in the late in&s;tance
I have been ju&s;t to your command&mdash;my
&s;en&s;es have been the only evidences
I have tru&s;ted. I have heard tho&s;e
&s;ounds which I can not doubt." The
marquis appeared &s;hocked. Ferdinand
perceived the change, and urged the
&s;ubject &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that the marquis
&s;uddenly a&s;&s;uming a look of grave im|portance,
commanded him to attend
him in the evening in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Ferdinand in pa&s;&s;ing from the mar|quis
met Hippolitus. He was pacing
the gallery in much &s;eeming agitation,
but ob&s;erving Ferdinand he advanced
to him. "I am ill at heart," &s;aid he,
in a melancholy tone, "a&s;&s;i&s;t me with
your advice. We will &s;tep into this
apartment where we can conver&s;e with|out
interruption."</P>
<P>"You are not ignorant," &s;aid he,
throwing him&s;elf into a chair, "of the
tender &s;entiments which your &s;i&s;ter
Julia has in&s;pired. I entreat you by
<PB N="112" REF="114">
that &s;acred friend&s;hip which has &s;o long
united us, to afford me an opportunity
of pleading my pa&s;&s;ion. Her heart,
which is &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of other impre&s;|&s;ions,
is, I fear, in&s;en&s;ible to love. Pro|cure
me, however, the &s;atisfaction of
certainty upon a point where the tor|tures
of &s;u&s;pence are &s;urely the mo&s;t
intolerable."</P>
<P>"Your penetration" replied Ferdi|nand,
"has for once for&s;aken you, el&s;e
you would now be &s;pared the tortures
of which you complain, for you would
have di&s;covered what I have long ob|&s;erved,
that Julia regards you with a
partial eye."</P>
<P>"Do not," &s;aid Hippolitus, "make
di&s;appointment more terrible by flat|tery;
neither &s;uffer the partiality of
friend&s;hip to mi&s;lead your judgment.
Your perceptions are affected by the
warmth of your feelings, and becau&s;e
you think I de&s;erve her di&s;tinction, you
believe I po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Alas! you de|ceive
your&s;elf, but not me!"</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
"The very rever&s;e," replied Ferdi|nand;
"tis you who deceive your&s;elf,
or rather it is the delicacy of the pa&s;&s;ion
which animates you, and which will
ever operate again&s;t your clear percep|tion
of a truth in which your happine&s;s
is &s;o deeply involved. Believe me, I
&s;peak not without rea&s;on;&mdash;&s;he loves
you."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words Hippolitus &s;tarted
from his &s;eat, and cla&s;ping his hands in
fervent joy, "Enchanting &s;ounds!"
cried he, in a voice tenderly impa&s;&s;ion|ed;
"<HI>could</HI> I but believe ye!&mdash;could I
<HI>but</HI> believe ye&mdash;this world were para|di&s;e!"</P>
<P>During this exclamation, the emoti|ons
of Julia, who &s;at in her clo&s;et ad|joining,
can with difficulty be imagin|ed.
A door which opened into it from
the apartment where this conver&s;ation
was held, was only half clo&s;ed. Agi|tated
with the plea&s;ure this declaration
excited, &s;he yet trembled with appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="114" REF="116">
left &s;he &s;hould be di&s;covered.
She hardly dared to breathe, much le&s;s
to move acro&s;s the clo&s;et to the door,
which opened upon the gallery, whence
&s;he might probably have e&s;caped un|noticed,
le&s;t the &s;ound of her &s;tep &s;hould
betray her. Compelled, therefore, to
remain where &s;he was, &s;he &s;at in a &s;tate
of fearful di&s;tre&s;s, which no colour of
language can paint.</P>
<P>"Alas!" re&s;umed Hippolitus, "I
too eagerly admit the po&s;&s;ibility of what
I wi&s;h. If you mean that I &s;hould re|ally
believe you, confirm your a&s;&s;ertion
by &s;ome proof." "Readily," rejoined
Ferdinand.</P>
<P>The heart of Julia beat quick.</P>
<P>"When you was &s;o &s;uddenly called
to Naples upon the illne&s;s of the mar|quis
Lomelli, I marked her conduct
well, and in that read the &s;entiments of
her heart. On the following morning,
I ob&s;erved in her countenance a re&s;tle&s;s
anxiety which I had never &s;een before.
<PB N="115" REF="117">
She watched the entrance of every per|&s;on
with an eager expectation, which
was as often &s;ucceeded by evident
di&s;appointment. At dinner your de|parture
was mentioned:&mdash;&s;he &s;pilt the
wine &s;he was carrying to her lips, and
for the remainder of the day was &s;pirit|le&s;s
and melancholy. I &s;aw her inef|fectual
&s;truggles to conceal the oppre&s;|&s;ion
at her heart. Since that time &s;he
has &s;eized every opportunity of with|drawing
from company. The gaiety
with which &s;he was &s;o lately charmed&mdash;charmed
her no longer; &s;he became
pen&s;ive, retired, and I have often heard
her &s;inging in &s;ome lonely &s;pot, the
mo&s;t moving and tender airs. Your
return produced a vi&s;ible and in&s;tanta|neous
alteration; &s;he has now re&s;umed
her gaiety; and the &s;oft confu&s;ion of
her countenance, whenever you ap|proach,
might alone &s;uffice to convince
you of the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion."</P>
<P>"O! talk for ever thus!" &s;ighed Hip|politus.
<PB N="116" REF="118">
"The&s;e words are &s;o &s;weet,
&s;o &s;oothing to my &s;oul, that I could
li&s;ten till I forgot I had a wi&s;h beyond
them. Yes!&mdash;Ferdinand, the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
are not to be doubted, and
conviction opens upon my mind a flow
of extacy I never knew till now. O!
lead me to her, that I may &s;peak the
&s;entiments which &s;well my heart."</P>
<P>They aro&s;e, when Julia, who with
difficulty had &s;upported her&s;elf, now
impelled by an irre&s;i&s;tible fear of in&s;tant
di&s;covery, ro&s;e al&s;o, and moved &s;oftly
towards the gallery. The &s;ound of her
&s;tep alarmed the count, who, apprehen|&s;ive
le&s;t his conver&s;ation had been over|heard,
was anxious to be &s;atisfied whe|ther
any per&s;on was in the clo&s;et. He
ru&s;hed in, and di&s;covered Julia! She
caught at a chair to &s;upport her trem|bling
frame; and overwhelmed with
mortifying &s;en&s;ations, &s;unk into it, and
hid her face in her robe. Hippolitus
threw him&s;elf at her feet, and &s;eizing
<PB N="117" REF="119">
her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips in expre&s;|&s;ive
&s;ilence. Some moments pa&s;&s;ed
before the confu&s;ion of either would
&s;uffer them to &s;peak. At length re|covering
his voice, "Can you, Madam,
&s;aid he, forgive this intru&s;ion, &s;o unin|tentional?
or will it deprive me of that
e&s;teem which I have but lately ventured
to believe I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which I value
more than exi&s;tence it&s;elf. O! &s;peak my
pardon! Let me not believe that a &s;in|gle
accident has de&s;troyed my peace for
ever."&mdash;"If your peace, Sir, depends
upon a knowledge of my e&s;teem," &s;aid
Julia, in a tremulous voice, "that
peace is already &s;ecure. If I wi&s;hed
even to deny the partiality I feel, it
would now be u&s;ele&s;s; and &s;ince I no
longer wi&s;h this, it would al&s;o be pain|ful."
Hippolitus could only weep his
thanks over the hand he &s;till held.
"Be &s;en&s;ible, however, of the delicacy
of my &s;ituation," continued &s;he, ri&s;ing,
"and &s;uffer me to withdraw." Saying this
<PB N="118" REF="120">
&s;he quitted the clo&s;et, leaving Hippoli|tus
overcome with this &s;weet confirma|tion
of his wi&s;hes, and Ferdinand not
yet recovered from the painful &s;urprize
which the di&s;covery of Julia had exci|ted.
He was deeply &s;en&s;ible of the
confu&s;ion he had occa&s;ioned her, and
knew that apologies would not re&s;tore
the compo&s;ure he had &s;o cruelly yet
unwarily di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Ferdinand awaited the hour appoint|ed
by the marquis in impatient curio&s;ity.
The &s;olemn air which the marquis a&s;|&s;umed
when he commanded him to at|tend,
had deeply impre&s;&s;ed his mind.
As the time drew nigh, expectation in|crea&s;ed,
and every moment &s;eemed to
linger into hours. At length he repair|ed
to the clo&s;et, where he did not re|main
long before the marquis entered.
The &s;ame chilling &s;olemnity marked
his manner. He locked the door of
the clo&s;et, and &s;eating him&s;elf, addre&s;&s;|ed
Ferdinand as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121">
"I am now going to repo&s;e in you
a confidence, which will &s;everely prove
the &s;trength of your honour. But before
I di&s;clo&s;e a &s;ecret, hitherto &s;o carefully
concealed, and now reluctantly told,
you mu&s;t &s;wear to pre&s;erve on this &s;ub|ject
an eternal &s;ilence. If you doubt
the &s;teadine&s;s of your di&s;cretion&mdash;now
declare it, and &s;ave your&s;elf from the
infamy, and the fatal con&s;equences,
which may attend a breach of your oath;&mdash;if,
on the contrary, you believe your|&s;elf
capable of a &s;trict integrity&mdash;now
accept the terms, and receive the &s;ecret
I offer." Ferdinand was awed by this
exordium&mdash;the impatience of curio&s;ity
was for a while &s;u&s;pended, and he he|&s;itated
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> her he &s;hould receive the
&s;ecret upon &s;uch terms. At length he
&s;ignified hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, con&s;ent, and the marquis
ari&s;ing, drew his &s;word from the &s;cab|bard.&mdash;"Here"
&s;aid he, offering it to
Ferdinand, "&s;eal your vows&mdash;&s;wear by
this &s;acred pledge of honour never to
<PB N="120" REF="122">
repeat what I &s;hall now reveal." Fer|dinand
bowed upon the &s;word, and
rai&s;ing his eyes to Heaven &s;olemnly
&s;wore. The marquis then re&s;umed his
&s;eat, and proceeded.</P>
<P>"You are not to learn that, about
a century ago, this ca&s;tle was in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Vincent, third marquis of
Mazzini, my grandfather. At that
time there exi&s;ted an inveterate hatred
between our family and that of della
Campo. I &s;hall not now revert to the
origin of the animo&s;ity, or relate the
particulars of the con&s;equent feuds&mdash;&s;uffice
it to ob&s;erve, that by the power
of our family, the della Campos were
unable to pre&s;erve their former con&s;e|quence
in Sicily and they have there|fore
quitted it for a foreign land to live
in unmole&s;ted &s;ecurity. To return to
my &s;ubject.&mdash;My grandfather, believ|ing
his life endangered by his enemy,
planted &s;pies upon him. He employ|ed
&s;ome of the numerous banditti who
<PB N="121" REF="123">
&s;ought protection in his &s;ervice, and
after &s;ome weeks pa&s;t in waiting for an
opportunity, they &s;eized Henry della
Campo, and brought him &s;ecretly to this
ca&s;tle. He was for &s;ome time confined
in a clo&s;e chamber of the &s;outhern build|ings,
where he expired; by what means
I &s;hall forbear to mention. The plan
had been &s;o well conducted, and the
&s;ecrecy &s;o &s;trictly pre&s;erved, that every
endeavour of his family to trace the
means of his di&s;appearance, proved
ineffectual. Their conjectures, if they
fell upon our family, were &s;upported by
no proof; and the della Campo's are to
this day ignorant of the mode of his
death. A rumour had prevailed long be|fore
the death of my father, that the &s;ou|thern
buildings of the ca&s;tle were haunt|ed.
I di&s;believed the fact, and treated it
accordingly. One night when every hu|man
being of the ca&s;tle, except my&s;elf,
was retired to re&s;t, I had &s;uch &s;trong
and dreadful proofs of the general a&s;|&s;ertion,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
that even at this moment I can
not recollect them without horror. Let
me, if po&s;&s;ible, forget them. From
that moment I for&s;ook tho&s;e buildings;
they have ever &s;ince been &s;hut up, and
the circum&s;tance I have mentioned, is
the true rea&s;on why I have re&s;ided &s;o
little at the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Ferdinand li&s;tened to this narrative
in &s;ilent horror. He remembered the te|merity
with which he had dared to pene|trate
tho&s;e apartments&mdash;the light, and
figure he had &s;een&mdash;and, above all, his
&s;ituation in the &s;tair-ca&s;e of the tower.
Every nerve thrilled at the recollection;
and the terrors of remembrance almo&s;t
equalled tho&s;e of reality.</P>
<P>The marquis permitted his daughters
to change their apartments, but he com|manded
Ferdinand to tell them, that
in granting their reque&s;t, he con&s;ulted
their ea&s;e only, and was him&s;elf by no
means convinced of its propriety. They
were accordingly re-in&s;tated in their
<PB N="123" REF="125">
former chambers, and the great room
only of Madame's apartments was re|&s;erved
for the marchione&s;s, who expre&s;&s;|ed
her di&s;content to the marquis in
terms of mingled cen&s;ure and lamenta|tion.
The marquis privately reproved
his daughters, for what he termed the
idle fancies of a weak mind; and de&s;ir|ed
them no more to di&s;turb the peace
of the ca&s;tle with the &s;ubject of their
late fears. They received this reproof
with &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;too much plea&s;|ed
with the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;uit to be
&s;u&s;ceptible of any emotion but joy.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, reflecting on the late di&s;|covery,
was &s;hocked to learn, what was
now forced upon his belief, that he was
the de&s;cendant of a murderer. He now
knew that innocent blood had been
&s;hed in the ca&s;tle, and that the walls
were &s;till the haunt of an unquiet &s;pirit,
which &s;eemed to call aloud for retribu|tion
on the po&s;terity of him who had
di&s;turbed its eternal re&s;t. Hippolitus
<PB N="124" REF="126">
perceived his dejection, and entreated
that he might participate his unea&s;i|ne&s;s;
but Ferdinand, who had hitherto
been frank and ingenuous, was now
inflexibly re&s;erved. "Forbear," &s;aid
he "to urge a di&s;covery of what I am
not permitted to reveal; this is the only
point upon which I conjure you to be
&s;ilent, and this, even to you, I can not
explain." Hippolitus was &s;urprized,
but pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject no farther.</P>
<P>Julia, though &s;he had been extremely
mortified by the circum&s;tances attend|ant
on the di&s;covery of her &s;entiments
to Hippolitus, experienced, after the
fir&s;t &s;hock had &s;ub&s;ided, an emotion
more plea&s;ing that painful. The late
conver&s;ation had painted in &s;trong co|lours
the attachment of her lover. His
diffidence&mdash;his &s;lowne&s;s to perceive the
effect of his merit&mdash;his &s;ucceeding rap|ture,
when conviction was at length
forced upon his mind; and his conduct
upon di&s;covering Julia, proved to her
<PB N="125" REF="127">
at once the delicacy and the &s;trength of
his pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he yielded her heart to
&s;en&s;ations of pure and unmixed delight.
She was rou&s;ed from this &s;tate of vi&s;ion|ary
happine&s;s, by a &s;ummons from the
marquis to attend him in the library.
A circum&s;tance &s;o unu&s;ual &s;urprized
her, and &s;he obeyed with trembling cu|rio&s;ity.
She found him pacing the room
in deep thought, and &s;he had &s;hut the
door before he perceived her. The
authoritative &s;everity in his countenance
alarmed her, and prepared her for a &s;ub|ject
of importance. He &s;eated him&s;elf
by her, and continued a moment &s;ilent.
At length, &s;teadily ob&s;erving her, "I
&s;ent for you, my child," &s;aid he, "to
declare the honour which awaits you.
The duke de Luovo has &s;olicited your
hand. An alliance &s;o &s;plendid was be|yond
my expectation. You will re|ceive
the di&s;tinction with the gratitude
it claims, and prepare for the celebra|tion
of the nuptials."</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
This &s;peech fell like the dart of death
upon the heart of Julia. She &s;at mo|tionle&s;s&mdash;&s;tupified
and deprived of the
power of utterance. The marquis ob|&s;erved
her con&s;ternation; and mi&s;taking
its cau&s;e, "I acknowledge," &s;aid he,
"that there is &s;omewhat abrupt in this
affair; but the joy occa&s;ioned by a di&s;|tinction
&s;o unmerited on your part,
ought to overcome the little feminine
weakne&s;s you might otherwi&s;e indulge.
Retire and compo&s;e your&s;elf; and ob|&s;erve,"
continued he, in a &s;tern voice,
"this is no time for fine&s;&s;e." The&s;e
words rou&s;ed Julia from her &s;tate of
horrid &s;tupefaction. "O! Sir," &s;aid
&s;he, throwing her&s;elf at his feet, "for|bear
to enforce authority upon a point
where to obey you would be wor&s;e than
death; if, indeed, to obey you were
po&s;&s;ible." "Cea&s;e," &s;aid the marquis,
"this affectation, and practi&s;e what be|comes
you." "Pardon me, my lord,"
&s;he replied, "my di&s;tre&s;s is, alas! un|feigned.
<PB N="127" REF="129">
I cannot love the duke."
"Away," interrupted the marquis,
"nor tempt my rage with objections
thus childi&s;h and ab&s;urd." "Yet hear
me, my lord," &s;aid Julia, tears &s;welling
in her eyes, "and pity the &s;ufferings of
a child, who never till this moment
has dared to di&s;pute your commands."</P>
<P>"Nor &s;hall &s;he now," &s;aid the mar|quis.
"What&mdash;when wealth, honour,
and di&s;tinction are laid at my feet, &s;hall
they be refu&s;ed, becau&s;e a fooli&s;h girl&mdash;a
very baby, who knows not good from
evil, cries, and &s;ays &s;he cannot love.
Let me not think of it&mdash;My ju&s;t anger
may, perhaps, out-run di&s;cretion, and
tempt me to cha&s;ti&s;e your folly.&mdash;At|tend
to what I &s;ay&mdash;accept the duke,
or quit this ca&s;tle for ever, and wander
where you will." Saying this, he bur&s;t
away, and Julia, who had hung weep|ing
upon his knees, fell pro&s;trate upon
the floor. The violence of the fall
completed the effect of her di&s;tre&s;s, and
<PB N="128" REF="130">
&s;he fainted. In this &s;tate &s;he remained
a con&s;iderable time. When &s;he recover|ed
her &s;en&s;es, the recollection of her
calamity bur&s;t upon her mind with a
force that almo&s;t again overwhelmed
her. She at length rai&s;ed her&s;elf from
the ground, and moved towards her
own apartment, but had &s;carcely reach|ed
the great gallery, when Hippolitus
entered it. Her trembling limbs would
no longer &s;upport her;&mdash;&s;he caught at
a banni&s;ter to &s;ave her&s;elf; and Hippo|litus,
with all his &s;peed, was &s;carcely in
time to prevent her falling. The pale
di&s;tre&s;s exhibited in her countenance
terrified him, and he anxiou&s;ly enquired
concerning it. She could an&s;wer him
only with her tears, which &s;he found it
impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppre&s;s; and gently di&s;|engaging
her&s;elf, tottered to her clo&s;et.
Hippolitus followed her to the door,
but de&s;i&s;ted from further importunity.
He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips in ten|der
&s;ilence, and withdrew &s;urprized and
alarmed.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">
Julia, re&s;igning her&s;elf to de&s;pair,
indulged in &s;olitude the exce&s;s of her
grief. A calamity, &s;o dreadful as the
pre&s;ent, had never before pre&s;ented it|&s;elf
to her imagination. The union
propo&s;ed would have been hateful to
her, even if &s;he had no prior attach|ment;
what then mu&s;t have been her
di&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he had given her heart to
him who de&s;erved all her admiration,
and returned all her affection.</P>
<P>The duke de Luovo was of a charac|ter
very &s;imilar to that of the marquis.
The love of power was his ruling pa&s;|&s;ion;&mdash;with
him no gentle or generous
&s;entiment meliorated the har&s;hne&s;s of
authority, or directed it to acts of bene|ficence.
He delighted in &s;imple undi&s;|gui&s;ed
tyranny. He had been twice
married, and the unfortunate women
&s;ubjected to his power, had fallen vic|tims
to the &s;low but corroding hand of
&s;orrow. He had one &s;on, who &s;ome
years before had e&s;caped the tyranny of
<PB N="130" REF="132">
his father, and had not been &s;ince heard
of. At the late fe&s;tival the duke had
&s;een Julia; and her beauty made &s;o
&s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he
had been induced now to &s;olicit her
hand. The marquis, delighted with the
pro&s;pect of a connexion &s;o flattering to
his favourite pa&s;&s;ion, readily granted
his con&s;ent, and immediately &s;ealed it
with a promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Julia remained for the re&s;t of the day
&s;hut up in her clo&s;et, where the tender
efforts of Madame and Emilia were
exerted to &s;often her di&s;tre&s;s. Towards
the clo&s;e of evening Ferdinand entered.
Hippolitus, &s;hocked at her ab&s;ence, had
reque&s;ted him to vi&s;it her, to alleviate
her affliction, and if po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover
its cau&s;e. Ferdinand, who tenderly loved
his &s;i&s;ter, was alarmed by the words of
Hippolitus, and immediately &s;ought her.
Her eyes were &s;welled with weeping, and
her countenance was but too expre&s;&s;ive
of the &s;tate of her mind. Ferdinand's di&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="131" REF="133">
when told of his father's conduct,
was &s;carcely le&s;s than her own. He
had plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the hope of
uniting the &s;i&s;ter of his heart, with the
friend whom he loved. An act of cruel
authority now di&s;&s;olved the fairy dream
of happine&s;s which his fancy had form|ed,
and de&s;troyed the peace of tho&s;e
mo&s;t dear to him. He &s;at for a long
time &s;ilent and dejected; at length,
&s;tarting from his melancholy reverie,
he bad Julia good night, and returned
to Hippolitus, who was waiting for him
with anxious impatience in the north
hall.</P>
<P>Ferdinand dreaded the effect of that
de&s;pair, which the intelligence he had
to communicate would produce in the
mind of Hippolitus. He revolved &s;ome
means of &s;oftening the dreadful truth;
but Hippolitus, quick to apprehend the
evil which love taught him to fear,
&s;eized at once upon the reality. "Tell
me all," &s;aid he, in a tone of a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="132" REF="134">
firmne&s;s. "I am prepared for the
wor&s;t." Ferdinand related the decree
of the marquis, and Hippolitus, &s;oon
&s;unk into an exce&s;s of grief which defi|ed,
as much as it required, the powers
of alleviation.</P>
<P>Julia, at length, retired to her cham|ber,
but the &s;orrow which occupied
her mind, with-held the ble&s;&s;ings of
&s;leep. Di&s;tracted and re&s;tle&s;s &s;he aro&s;e,
and gently opened the window of her
apartment. The night was &s;till, and
not a breath di&s;turbed the &s;urface of the
waters. The moon &s;hed a mild radi|ance
over the waves, which in gentle
undulations &s;lowed upon the &s;ands.
The &s;cene in&s;en&s;ibly tranquillized her
&s;pirits. A tender and plea&s;ing melan|choly
diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over her mind; and
as &s;he mu&s;ed, &s;he heard the da&s;hing of
di&s;tant oars. Pre&s;ently the perceived
upon the light &s;urface of the &s;ea a &s;mall
boat. The &s;ound of the oars cea&s;ed,
and a &s;olemn &s;train of harmony (&s;uch
<PB N="133" REF="135">
as fancy wafts from the abodes of the
ble&s;&s;ed) &s;tole upon the &s;ilence of night.
A chorus of voices now &s;welied upon
the air, and died away at di&s;tance. In
the &s;train Julia recollected the mid|night
hymn to the virgin, and holy en|thu&s;ia&s;m
filled her heart. The chorus
was repeated, accompanied by a &s;olemn
&s;triking of oars. A &s;igh of extacy &s;tole
from her bo&s;om. Silence returned.
The divine melody &s;he had heard calm|ed
the tumult of her mind, and &s;he &s;unk
in &s;weet repo&s;e.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e in the morning refre&s;hed
by light &s;lumbers; but the recollec|tion
of her &s;orrows &s;oon returned with
new force, and &s;ickening faintne&s;s over|came
her. In this &s;ituation &s;he receiv|ed
a me&s;&s;age from the marquis to at|tend
him in&s;tantly. She obeyed, and
he bade her prepare to receive the duke,
who that morning purpo&s;ed to vi&s;it the
ca&s;tle. He commanded her to attire
her&s;elf richly, and to welcome him with
<PB N="134" REF="136">
&s;miles. Julia &s;ubmitted in &s;ilence. She
&s;aw the marquis was inflexibly re&s;olved,
and &s;he withdrew to indulge the an|gui&s;h
of her heart, and prepare for this
dete&s;ted interview.</P>
<P>The clock had &s;truck twelve, when
a flouri&s;h of trumpets announced the
approach of the duke. The heart of
Julia &s;unk at the &s;ound, and &s;he threw
her&s;elf on a &s;opha overwhelmed with
bitter &s;en&s;ations. Here &s;he was &s;oon di&s;|turbed
by a me&s;&s;age from the marquis.
She aro&s;e, and tenderly embracing Emi|lia,
their tears for &s;ome moments flow|ed
together At length &s;ummoning all
her fortitude, &s;he de&s;cended to the hall,
where &s;he was met by the marquis. He
led her to the &s;aloon in which the duke
&s;at, with whom having conver&s;ed a &s;hort
time, he withdrew. The emotion of
Julia at this in&s;tant was beyond any
thing &s;he had before &s;uffered; but by a
&s;udden and &s;trange exertion of fortitude,
which the force of de&s;perate calamity
<PB N="135" REF="137">
&s;ometimes affords us, but which infe|rior
forrow toils after in vain, &s;he re|covered
her compo&s;ure, and re&s;umed
her natural dignity. For a moment &s;he
wondered at her&s;elf, and &s;he formed the
dangerous re&s;olution of throwing her|&s;elf
upon the genero&s;ity of the duke, by
acknowledging her reluctance to the
engagement, and &s;oliciting him to with|draw
his &s;uit.</P>
<P>The duke approached her with an
air of proud conde&s;cen&s;ion; and taking
her hand, placed him&s;elf be&s;ide her.
Having paid &s;ome formal and general
compliments to her beauty, he proceed|ed
to profe&s;s him&s;elf her admirer. She
li&s;tened for &s;ome time to his profe&s;&s;ions,
and when he appeared willing to hear
her, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed him&mdash;"I am ju&s;tly
&s;en&s;ible, my lord, of the di&s;tinction you
offer me, and mu&s;t lament that re&s;pect|ful
gratitude is the only &s;entiment I can
return. Nothing can more &s;trongly
prove my confidence in your genero&s;ity,
<PB N="136" REF="138">
than when I confe&s;s to you, that paren|tal
authority urges me to give my hand,
whither my heart can not accompany
it."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed&mdash;the duke continued &s;ilent.&mdash;"'Tis
you only, my lord, who can
relea&s;e me from a &s;ituation &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing;
and to your goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice I ap|peal,
certain that nece&s;&s;ity will excu&s;e
the &s;ingularity of my conduct, and that
I &s;hall not appeal in vain."</P>
<P>The duke was embara&s;&s;ed&mdash;a flu&s;h
of pride over&s;pread his countenance,
and he &s;eemed endeavouring to &s;tifle
the feelings that &s;welled his heart. "I
had been prepared Madam," &s;aid he,
"to expect a very different reception,
and had certainly no rea&s;on to believe
that the duke de Luovo was likely to &s;ue
in vain. Since, however, Madam, you
acknowledge that you have already di&s;|po&s;ed
of your affections, I &s;hall certainly
be very willing, if the marquis will re|lea&s;e
me from our mutual engagements,
to re&s;ign you to a more favoured lover."</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
"Pardon me, my lord," &s;aid Julia,
blu&s;hing, "&s;uffer me to"&mdash;"I am
not ea&s;ily deceived, Madam," interrupt|ed
the duke,&mdash;"your conduct can be at|tributed
only to the influence of a prior
attachment; and though for &s;o young
a lady, &s;uch a circum&s;tance is &s;ome|what
extraordinary, I have certainly no
right to arraign your choice. Permit
me to wi&s;h you a good morning." He
bowed low, and quitted the room.
Julia now experienced a new di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he
dreaded the re&s;entment of the marquis,
when he &s;hould be informed of her con|ver&s;ation
with the duke, of who&s;e cha|racter
&s;he now judged too ju&s;tly not to
repent the confidence &s;he had repo&s;ed
in him.</P>
<P>The duke, on quitting Julia, went
to the marquis, with whom he remained
in conver&s;ation &s;ome hours. When he
had left the ca&s;tle, the marquis &s;ent for
his daughter, and poured forth his re|&s;entment
with all the violence of threats,
<PB N="138" REF="140">
and all the acrimony of contempt. So
&s;everely did he ridicule the idea of her
di&s;po&s;ing of her heart, and &s;o dreadfully
did he denounce vengeance on her di&s;|obedience,
that &s;he &s;carcely thought her|&s;elf
&s;afe in his pre&s;ence. She &s;tood trem|bling
and confu&s;ed, and heard his re|proaches
without the power to reply.
At length the marquis informed her,
that the nuptials would be &s;olemnized
on the third day from the pre&s;ent; and
as he quitted the room, a flood of tears
came to her relief, and &s;aved her from
fainting.</P>
<P>Julia pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day
in her clo&s;et with Emilia. Night re|turned,
but brought her no peace. She
&s;at long after the departure of Emilia;
and to beguile recollection, &s;he &s;elected
a favourite author, endeavouring to re|vive
tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations his page had once
excited. She opened to a pa&s;&s;age, the
tender &s;orrow of which was applicable
to her own &s;ituation, and her tears flowed
<PB N="139" REF="141">
anew. Her grief was &s;oon &s;u&s;pended
by apprehen&s;ion. Hitherto a deadly
&s;ilence had reigned through the ca&s;tle,
interrupted only by the wind, who&s;e
low &s;ound crept at intervals through
the galleries. She now thought &s;he
heard a foot-&s;tep near her door, but
pre&s;ently all was &s;till, for &s;he believed
&s;he had been deceived by the wind.
The &s;ucceeding moment, however, con|vinced
her of her error, for &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the low whi&s;perings of &s;ome
per&s;ons in the gallery. Her &s;pirits, al|ready
weakened by &s;orrow, de&s;erted her;
&s;he was &s;eized with an univer&s;al terror,
and pre&s;ently afterwards a low voice
called her from without, and the door
was opened by Ferdinand.</P>
<P>She &s;hrieked and fainted. On re|covering,
&s;he found her&s;elf &s;upported by
Ferdinand and Hippolitus, who had
&s;tolen this moment of &s;ilence and &s;ecu|rity
to gain admittance to her pre&s;ence.
Hippolitus came to urge a propo&s;al,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
which de&s;pair only could have &s;ugge&s;t|ed.
"Fly," &s;aid he, "from the au|thority
of a father who abu&s;es his pow|er,
and a&s;&s;ert the liberty of choice,
which nature a&s;&s;igned you. Let the
de&s;perate &s;ituation of my hopes plead
excu&s;e for the apparent boldne&s;s of this
addre&s;s, and let the man who exi&s;ts but
for you, be the means of &s;aving you from
de&s;truction. Alas! Madam, you are
&s;ilent, and perhaps I have forfeited by
this propo&s;al, the confidence I &s;o lately
flattered my&s;elf I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If &s;o, I
will &s;ubmit to my fate in &s;ilence, and
will to-morrow quit a &s;cene which pre|&s;ents
only images of di&s;tre&s;s to my mind.</P>
<P>Julia could &s;peak but with her tears.
A variety of &s;trong and contending
emotions &s;truggled at her brea&s;t, and
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed the power of utterance. Fer|dinand
&s;econded the propo&s;al of the
count. "It is unnece&s;&s;ary," my &s;i&s;ter,
&s;aid he, "to point out the mi&s;ery which
awaits you here. I love you too well
<PB N="141" REF="143">
tamely to &s;uffer you to be &s;acrificed to
ambition, and to a pa&s;&s;ion &s;till more
hateful. I now glory in calling Hippo|litus
my friend&mdash;let me ere long re|ceive
him as a brother. I can give no
&s;tronger te&s;timony of my e&s;teem for his
character, than in the wi&s;h I now ex|pre&s;s.
Believe me he has a heart wor|thy
of your acceptance&mdash;a heart noble
and expan&s;ive as your own." "Ah,
cea&s;e," &s;aid Julia, "to dwell upon a
character of who&s;e worth I am fully
&s;en&s;ible. Your kindne&s;s and his merit
can never be forgotten by her who&s;e
misfortunes you have &s;o generou&s;ly &s;uf|fered
to intere&s;t you." She pau&s;ed in
&s;ilent he&s;itation. A &s;en&s;e of delicacy
made her he&s;itate upon the deci&s;ion
which her heart &s;o warmly prompted.
If &s;he fled with Hippolitus, &s;he would
avoid one evil, and encounter another.
She would e&s;cape the dreadful de&s;tiny
awaiting her, but mu&s;t, perhaps, fully
the purity of that reputation, which was
<PB N="142" REF="144">
dearer to her than exi&s;tence. In a mind
like her's, exqui&s;itely &s;u&s;ceptible of the
pride of honour, this fear was able
to counteract every other con&s;ideration,
and to keep her intentions in a &s;tate of
painful &s;u&s;pence. She &s;ighed deeply,
and continued &s;ilent. Hippolitus was
alarmed by the calm di&s;tre&s;s which her
countenance exhibited. "O! Julia,"
&s;aid he, "relieve me from this dread|ful
&s;u&s;pen&s;e!&mdash;&s;peak to me&mdash;explain this
&s;ilence." She looked mournfully upon
him&mdash;her lips moved, but no &s;ounds
were uttered. As he repeated his que&s;|tion,
&s;he waved her hand, and &s;unk back
in her chair. She had not fainted, but
continued &s;ome time in a &s;tate of &s;tupor
not le&s;s alarming. The importance of
the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, operating upon
her mind, already hara&s;&s;ed by di&s;tre&s;s,
had produced a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion
of rea&s;on. Hippolitus hung over her in
an agony not be de&s;cribed, and Ferdi|nand
vainly repeated her name. At
<PB N="143" REF="145">
length, uttering a deep &s;igh, &s;he rai&s;ed
her&s;elf, and like one awakened from a
dream, gazed around her. Hippolitus
thanked God fervently in his heart.
"Tell me but that you are well," &s;aid
he, "and that I may dare to hope,
and we will leave you to repo&s;e." "My
&s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Ferdinand, "con&s;ult only
your own wi&s;hes, and leave the re&s;t to
me. Suffer a confidence in me to di&s;|&s;ipate
the doubts with which you are
agitated." "Ferdinand," &s;aid Julia,
emphatically, "how &s;hall I expre&s;s
the gratitude your kindne&s;s has exci|ted?"
"Your gratitude," &s;aid he, "will
be be&s;t &s;hewn in con&s;ulting your own
wi&s;hes; for be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever
procures you happine&s;s, will mo&s;t ef|fectually
e&s;tabli&s;h mine. Do not &s;uffer
the prejudices of education to render
you mi&s;erable. Believe that a choice
which involves the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery
of your whole life, ought to be decided
only by your&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
"Let us forbear for the pre&s;ent,"
&s;aid Hippolitus, "to urge the &s;ubject.
Repo&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary for you," addre&s;&s;ing
Julia, "and I will not &s;uffer a &s;elfi&s;h
con&s;ideration any longer to with-hold
you from it.&mdash;Grant me but this reque&s;t&mdash;that
at this hour to-morrow night, I
may return hither to receive my doom."
Julia having con&s;ented to receive Hip|politus
and Ferdinand, they quitted the
clo&s;et. In turning into the grand gal|lery,
they were &s;urpri&s;ed by the appear|ance
of a light, which gleamed upon
the wall that terminated their view. It
&s;eemed to proceed from a door which
opened upon a back &s;tair-ca&s;e. They
pu&s;hed on, but it almo&s;t in&s;tantly di&s;ap|peared,
and upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e all was
&s;till. They then &s;eparated, and retired
to their apartments, &s;omewhat alarmed
by this circum&s;tance, which induced
them to &s;u&s;pect that their vi&s;it to Julia
had been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Julia pa&s;&s;ed the night in broken &s;lum|bers,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
and anxious con&s;ideration.
On her pre&s;ent deci&s;ion, hung the cri&s;is
of her fate. Her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the
influence of Hippolitus over her heart,
made her fear to indulge its predilection,
by tru&s;ting to her own opinion of its fide|lity.
She &s;hrunk from the di&s;graceful
idea of an elopement, yet &s;he &s;aw no
means of avoiding this, but by ru&s;hing
upon the fate &s;o dreadful to her imagi|nation.</P>
<P>On the following night, when the in|habitants
of the ca&s;tle were retired to
re&s;t, Hippolitus, who&s;e expectation had
lengthened the hours into ages, accom|panied
by Ferdinand, revi&s;ited the clo|&s;et.
Julia, who had known no interval
of re&s;t &s;ince they la&s;t left her, received
them with much agitation. The vi|vid
glow of health had fled her check,
and was &s;ucceeded by a languid delica|cy,
le&s;s beautiful, but more intere&s;ting.
To the eager enquiries of Hippolitus,
&s;he returned no an&s;wer, but faintly &s;mil|ing
<PB N="146" REF="148">
through her tears, pre&s;ented him
her hand, and covered her face with
her robe. "I receive it," cried he,
"as the pledge of my happine&s;s;&mdash;yet&mdash;yet
let your voice ratify the gift."
"If the pre&s;ent conce&s;&s;ion does not
&s;ink me in your e&s;teem," &s;aid Julia, in a
low tone, "this hand is your's." "The
conce&s;&s;ion, my love (for by that tender
name I may now call you) would, if
po&s;&s;ible, rai&s;e you in my e&s;teem; but
&s;ince that has been long incapable of ad|dition,
it can only heighten my opinion
of my&s;elf, and increa&s;e my gratitude
to you: gratitude which I will endea|vour
to &s;hew by an anxious care of your
happine&s;s, and by the tender attentions
of a whole life. From this ble&s;&s;ed mo|ment,"
continued he, in a voice of
rapture, "permit me, in thought, to
hail you as my wife. From this mo|ment,
let me bani&s;h every ve&s;tige of &s;or|row&mdash;let
me dry tho&s;e tears," gently
pre&s;&s;ing her cheek with his lips, "never
<PB N="147" REF="149">
to &s;pring again."&mdash;The gratitude and
joy which Ferdinand expre&s;&s;ed upon
this occa&s;ion, united with the tenderne&s;s
of Hippolitus, to &s;oothe the agitated
&s;pirits of Julia, and &s;he gradually reco|vered
her complacency.</P>
<P>They now arranged their plan of e&s;|cape,
in the execution of which no
time was to be lo&s;t, &s;ince the nuptials
with the duke were to be &s;olemnized
on the day after the morrow. Their
&s;cheme, whatever it was that &s;hould be
adopted, they therefore re&s;olved to
execute on the following night. But
when they de&s;cended from the fir&s;t
warmth of enterprize, to minuter exa|mination,
they &s;oon found the difficul|ties
of the undertaking. The keys of
the ca&s;tle were kept by Robert, the con|fidential
&s;ervant of the marquis, who
every night depo&s;ited them in an iron
che&s;t in his chamber. To obtain them
by &s;tratagem &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible, and
Ferdinand feared to tamper with the ho|ne&s;ty
<PB N="148" REF="150">
of this man, who had been many
years in the &s;ervice of the marquis.
Dangerous as was the attempt, no
other alternative appeared, and they
were therefore compelled to re&s;t all
their hopes upon the experiment. It
was &s;ettled, that if the keys could be
procured, Ferdinand and Hippolitus
&s;hould meet Julia in the clo&s;et. That
they &s;hould convey her to the &s;ea &s;hore,
from whence a boat, which was to be
kept in waiting, would carry them to
the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Calabria, where the
marriage might be &s;olemnized without
danger of interruption. But, as it was
nece&s;&s;ary that Ferdinand &s;hould not ap|pear
in the affair, it was agreed that he
&s;hould return to the ca&s;tle immediately,
upon the embarkation of his &s;i&s;ter.
Having thus arranged their plan of ope|ration,
they &s;eparated till the following
night, which was to decide the fate of
Hippolitus and Julia.</P>
<P>Julia, who&s;e mind was &s;oothed by the
<PB N="149" REF="151">
&s;raternal kindne&s;s of Ferdinand, and the
tender a&s;&s;urances of Hippolitus, now
experienced an interval of repo&s;e. At
the return of day &s;he awoke refre&s;hed,
and tolerably compo&s;ed. She &s;elected
the few clothes which were nece&s;&s;ary,
and prepared them for her journey. A
&s;entiment of genero&s;ity ju&s;tified her in
the re&s;erve &s;he pre&s;erved to Emilia and
Madame de Menon, who&s;e faithfulne&s;s
and attachment &s;he could not doubt, but
whom &s;he di&s;dained to involve in the
di&s;grace that mu&s;t fall upon them,
&s;hould their knowledge of her flight be
di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ca&s;tle was a
&s;cene of confu&s;ion. The magnificent
preparations which were making for
the nuptials, engaged all eyes, and bu|&s;ied
all hands. The marchione&s;s had
the direction of the whole, and the ala|crity
with which &s;he acquitted her&s;elf,
te&s;tified how much &s;he was plea&s;ed with
the alliance, and created a &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="150" REF="152">
that it had not been concerted without
&s;ome exertion of her influence. Thus
was Julia de&s;igned the joint victim of
ambition, and illicit love.</P>
<P>The compo&s;ure of Julia declined
with the day, who&s;e hours had crept
heavily along. As the night drew on,
her anxiety for the &s;ucce&s;s of Ferdinand's
negociation with Robert, increa&s;ed to
a painful degree. A variety of new
emotions pre&s;&s;ed at her heart, and &s;ub|dued
her &s;pirits. When &s;he bade Emilia
good night, &s;he thought &s;he beheld her
for the la&s;t time. The ideas of the di&s;|tance
which would &s;eparate them, of
the dangers &s;he was going to encounter,
with a train of wild and fearful antici|pations,
crowded upon her mind, tears
&s;prang in her eyes, and it was with dif|ficulty
&s;he avoided betraying her emo|tions.
Of Madame too, her heart took
a tender farewell. At length &s;he heard
the marquis retire to his apartment, and
the doors belonging to the &s;everal cham|bers
<PB N="151" REF="153">
of the gue&s;ts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively clo&s;e. She
marked with trembling attention the
gradual change from bu&s;tle to quiet,
till all was &s;till.</P>
<P>She now held her&s;elf in readine&s;s to
depart, at the moment in which Ferdi|nand
and Hippolitus, for who&s;e &s;teps
in the gallery &s;he eagerly li&s;tened, &s;hould
appear. The ca&s;tle clock &s;truck twelve.
The &s;ound &s;eemed to &s;hake the pile. Ju|lia
felt it thrill upon her heart. "I hear
you," &s;ighed &s;he "for the la&s;t time."
The &s;tillne&s;s of death &s;ucceeded. She
continued to li&s;ten, but no &s;ound met
her ear. For a con&s;iderable time &s;he &s;at
in a &s;tate of anxious expectation not to
be de&s;cribed. The clock chimed the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
quarters, and her fear ro&s;e to
each additional &s;ound. At length &s;he
heard it &s;trike one. Hollow was that
&s;ound, and dreadful to her hopes, for
neither Hippolitus nor Ferdinand ap|peared.
She grew faint with fear and
di&s;appointment. Her mind, which for
<PB N="152" REF="154">
two hours had been kept upon the
&s;tretch of expectation, now re&s;igned
it&s;elf to de&s;pair. She gently opened
the door of her clo&s;et, and looked upon
the gallery, but all was lonely and &s;i|lent.
It appeared that Robert had re|fu&s;ed
to be acce&s;&s;ary to their &s;cheme,
and it was probable that he had be|trayed
it to the marquis. Overwhelmed
with bitter reflections, &s;he threw her&s;elf
upon the &s;opha in the fir&s;t di&s;traction
of de&s;pair. Suddenly &s;he thought &s;he
heard a noi&s;e in the gallery; and as &s;he
&s;tarted from her po&s;ture to li&s;ten to the
&s;ound, the door of her clo&s;et was gently
opened by Ferdinand. "Come, my
love," &s;aid he, "the keys are ours, and
we have not a moment to lo&s;e; our de|lay
has been unavoidable, but this is no
time for explanation." Julia, almo&s;t
fainting, gave her hand to Ferdinand;
and Hippolitus, after &s;ome &s;hort expre&s;|&s;ion
of his thankfulne&s;s, followed. They
pa&s;&s;ed the door of Madame's chamber;
<PB N="153" REF="155">
and treading the gallery with &s;low and
&s;ilent &s;teps, de&s;cended to the hall. This
they cro&s;&s;ed towards a door, after open|ing
which they were to find their way
through various pa&s;&s;ages to a remote
part of the ca&s;tle, where a private door
opened upon the walls. Ferdinand car|ried
the &s;everal keys. They fa&s;tened
the hall door after them, and proceeded
through a narrow pa&s;&s;age terminating in
a &s;tair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended, and had hardly
reached the bottom, when they heard a
loud noi&s;e at the door above, and pre|&s;ently
the voices of &s;everal people. Ju|lia
&s;carcely felt the ground &s;he trod
on, and Ferdinand &s;lew to unlock a
door that ob&s;tructed their way. He
applied the different keys, and at length
found the proper one, but the lock
was ru&s;ted, and refu&s;ed to yield. Their
di&s;tre&s;s now was not to be conceived.
The noi&s;e above increa&s;ed, and it &s;eem|ed
as if the people were forcing the
<PB N="154" REF="156">
door. Hippolitus and Ferdinand vain|ly
tried to turn the key. A &s;udden cra&s;h
from above convinced them that the
door had yielded, when making another
de&s;perate effort, the key broke in the
lock. Trembling and exhau&s;ted, Julia
gave her&s;elf up for lo&s;t. As &s;he hung
upon Ferdinand, Hippolitus vainly en|deavoured
to &s;oothe her&mdash;the noi&s;e &s;ud|denly
cea&s;ed. They li&s;tened, dreading
to hear the &s;ounds renewed; but, to their
utter a&s;toni&s;hment, the &s;ilence of the
place remained undi&s;turbed. They had
now time to breathe, and to con&s;ider
the po&s;&s;ibility of effecting their e&s;cape,
for from the marquis they had no mer|cy
to hope. Hippolitus, in order to a&s;|certain
whether the people had quitted
the door above, began to a&s;cend the
pa&s;&s;age, in which he had not gone many
&s;teps, when the noi&s;e was renewed with
increa&s;ed violence. He in&s;tantly re|treated;
and making a de&s;perate pu&s;h
at the door below, which ob&s;tructed
<PB N="155" REF="157">
their pa&s;&s;age, it &s;eemed to yield, and by
another effort of Ferdinand, bur&s;t open.
They had not an in&s;tant to lo&s;e, for they
now heard the &s;teps of per&s;ons de&s;cend|ing
the &s;tairs. The avenue they were
in opened into a kind of chamber,
whence three pa&s;&s;ages branched, of
which they immediately cho&s;e the fir&s;t.
Another door now ob&s;tructed their pa&s;|&s;age,
and they were compelled to wait
while Ferdinand applied the keys.
"Be quick," &s;aid Julia, "or we are
lo&s;t. O! if this lock too is ru&s;ted!"&mdash;"Hark!
&s;aid Ferdinand." They now
di&s;covered what apprehen&s;ion had before
prevented them from perceiving, that
the &s;ounds of pur&s;uit were cea&s;ed, and
all again was &s;ilent. As this could hap|pen
only by the mi&s;take of their pur&s;u|ers,
in taking the wrong <HI>route,</HI> they re|&s;olved
to pre&s;erve their advantage, by
concealing the light which Ferdinand
now covered with his cloak. The door
was opened, and they pa&s;&s;ed on, but
<PB N="156" REF="158">
they were perplexed in the intricacies of
the place, and wandered about in vain
endeavour to find their way. Often did
they pau&s;e to li&s;ten, and often did fan|cy
give them &s;ounds of fearful import.
At length they entered on the pa&s;&s;age,
which Ferdinand knew led directly to a
door that opened on the woods. Re|joiced
at this certainty, they &s;oon reach|ed
the &s;pot which was to give them li|berty.</P>
<P>Ferdinand turned the key, the door
unclo&s;ed, and to their infinite joy di&s;|covered
to them the grey dawn. "Now,
my love," &s;aid Hippolitus, "you are
&s;afe, and I am happy."&mdash;Immediately
a loud voice from without exclaimed,
"Take, villain, the reward of your
perfidy!" at the &s;ame in&s;tant Hippo|litus
received a &s;word in his body,
and uttering a deep &s;igh, fell to the
ground. Julia &s;hrieked, and fainted.
Ferdinand, drawing his &s;word, advanc|ed
towards the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, upon who&s;e
<PB N="157" REF="159">
countenance the light of his lamp then
&s;hone, and di&s;covered to him his father!
The &s;word fell from his gr&s;ap, and he
&s;tarted back in an agony of horror. He
was in&s;tantly &s;urrounded, and &s;eized by
the &s;ervants of the marquis, while the
marquis him&s;elf denounced vengeance
upon his head, and ordered him to be
thrown into the dungeon of the ca&s;tle.
At this in&s;tant the &s;ervants of the count,
who were awaiting his arrival on the &s;ea
&s;hore, hearing the tumult, ha&s;tened to
the &s;cene, and there beheld their belov|ed
ma&s;ter, lifele&s;s and weltering in his
blood. They conveyed the bleeding bo|dy,
with loud lamentations, on board the
ve&s;&s;el which had been prepared for
him, and immediately &s;et &s;ail for Italy.</P>
<P>Julia, on recovering her &s;en&s;es, &s;ound
her&s;elf in a &s;mall room, of which &s;he
had no remembrance, with her maid
weeping over her. Recollection, when
it returned, brought to her mind an
energy of grief, which exceeded even
<PB N="158" REF="160">
all former conceptions of &s;uffering.
Yet her mi&s;ery was heightened by the
intelligence which &s;he now received.
She learned that Hippolitus had been
borne away lifele&s;s by his people, that
Ferdinand was confined in a dungeon
by order of the marquis, and that her|&s;elf
was a pri&s;oner in a remote room,
from which, on the day after the mor|row,
&s;he was to be removed to the cha|pel
of the ca&s;tle, and there &s;acrificed to
the ambition of her father, and the ab|&s;urd
love of the duke de Luovo.</P>
<P>This accumulation of evil &s;ubdued
each power of re&s;i&s;tance, and reduced
Julia to a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction.
No per&s;on was allowed to approach her
but her maid, and the &s;ervant who
brought her food. Emilia, who, though
&s;hocked by Julia's apparent want of
confidence, &s;everely &s;ymphathized in
her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;olicited to &s;ee her; but
the pain of denial was &s;o &s;harply aggra|vated
by rebuke, that &s;he dared not
again to urge the reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161">
In the mean time Ferdinand, involv|ed
in the gloom of a dungeon, was re|&s;igned
to the painful recollection of
the pa&s;t, and a horrid anticipation of the
future. From the re&s;entment of the mar|quis,
who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were wild and ter|rible,
and who&s;e rank gave him an un|limited
power of life and death in his own
territories, Ferdinand had much to fear.
Yet &s;elfi&s;h apprehen&s;ion &s;oon yielded to a
more noble &s;orrow. He mourned the
fate of Hippolitus, and the &s;ufferings
of Julia. He could attribute the fai|lure
of their &s;cheme only to the treach|ery
of Robert, who had, however,
met the wi&s;hes of Ferdinand, with
&s;trong apparent &s;incerity, and generous
intere&s;t in the cau&s;e of Julia. On the
night of the intended elopement he
had con&s;igned the keys to Ferdinand,
who, immediately on receiving them,
went to the apartment of Hippolitus.
There they were detained till after
the clock had &s;truck one, by a low
<PB N="160" REF="162">
noi&s;e, which returned at intervals, and
convinced them, that &s;ome part of the
family was not yet retired to re&s;t. This
noi&s;e was undoubtedly occa&s;ioned by
the people whom the marquis had em|ployed
to watch, and who&s;e vigilance
was too faithful to &s;uffer the fugitives
to e&s;cape. The very caution of Ferdi|nand
defeated its purpo&s;e; for it is pro|bable,
that had he attempted to quit
the ca&s;tle by the common entrance, he
might have e&s;caped. The keys of the
grand door, and tho&s;e of the courts, re|maining
in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Robert,
the marquis was certain of the intended
place of their departure; and was thus
enabled to defeat their hopes at the very
moment when they exulted in their &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>When the marchione&s;s learned the
fate of Hippolitus, the re&s;entment of
jealous pa&s;&s;ion, yielded to emotions of
pity. Revenge was &s;atisfied, and &s;he
could now lament the &s;ufferings of a
<PB N="161" REF="163">
youth, who&s;e per&s;onal charms had touch|ed
her heart as much as his virtues had
di&s;appointed her hopes. Still true to pa&s;|&s;ion,
and inacce&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on, &s;he poured
upon the defencele&s;s Julia her anger for
that calamity of which &s;he her&s;elf was
the unwilling cau&s;e. By a dextrous adapt|ation
of her powers, &s;he had worked
upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the marquis, &s;o as
to render him relentle&s;s in the pur&s;uit
of ambitious purpo&s;es, and in&s;atiable in
revenging his di&s;appointment. But the
effects of her artifices exceeded her in|tention
in exerting them; and when &s;he
meant only to &s;acrifice a rival to her
love, &s;he found &s;he had given up its ob|ject
to revenge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE nuptial morn, &s;o ju&s;tly dread|ed
by Julia, and &s;o impatiently
awaited by the marquis, now arrived.
The marriage was to be celebrated with
a magnificence which demon&s;trated
the joy it occa&s;ioned to the marquis.
The ca&s;tle was fitted up in a &s;tyle of
grandeur &s;uperior to any thing that had
been before &s;een in it. The neighbour|ing
nobility were invited to an enter|tainment
which was to conclude with
a &s;plendid ball and &s;upper, and the
gates were to be thrown open to all who
cho&s;e to partake of the bounty of the
marquis. At an early hour the duke,
attended by a numerous retinue, enter|ed
the ca&s;tle. Ferdinand heard from
his dungeon, where the rigour and the
policy of the marquis &s;till confined him,
the loud clattering of hoofs in the
court yard above, the rolling of the
<PB N="163" REF="165">
carriage wheels, and all the tumultuous
bu&s;tle which the entrance of the duke
occa&s;ioned. He too well under&s;tood the
cau&s;e of this uproar, and it awakened
in him &s;en&s;ations re&s;embling tho&s;e which
the condemned criminal feels, when his
ears are a&s;&s;ailed by the dreadful &s;ounds
that precede his execution. When he
was able to think of him&s;elf, he won|dered
by what means the marquis would
reconcile his ab&s;ence to the gue&s;ts. He,
however, knew too well the di&s;&s;ipated
character of the Sicilian nobility, to
doubt, that whatever &s;tory &s;hould be
invented would be very readily believed
by them; who, even if they knew the
truth, would not &s;uffer a di&s;covery of
their knowledge to interrupt the fe&s;ti|vity
which was offered them.</P>
<P>The marquis and marchione&s;s receiv|ed
the duke in the outer hall, and con|ducted
him to the &s;aloon, where he par|took
of the refre&s;hments prepared for
him, and from thence retired to the cha|pel.
<PB N="164" REF="166">
The marquis now withdrew to
lead Julia to the altar, and Emilia was
ordered to attend at the door of the cha|pel,
in which the prie&s;t and a numerous
company were already a&s;&s;embled. The
marchione&s;s, a prey to the turbulence of
&s;ucceeding pa&s;&s;ions, exulted in the near
completion of her favourite &s;cheme.
A di&s;appointment, however, was pre|pared
for her, which would at once
cru&s;h the triumph of her malice and
her pride. The marquis, on entering
the pri&s;on of Julia, found it empty!
His a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation, upon
the di&s;covery, almo&s;t overpowered his
rea&s;on. Of the &s;ervants of the ca&s;tle,
who were immediately &s;ummoned, he
enquired concerning her e&s;cape, with a
mixture of fury and &s;orrow, which left
them no opportunity for reply. They
had, however, no information to give,
but that her woman had not appeared
during the whole morning. In the
pri&s;on were found the bridal habili|ments
which the marchione&s;s her&s;elf
<PB N="165" REF="167">
had &s;ent on the preceding night, toge|ther
with a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Emilia,
which contained the following words:</P>
<P>"Adieu, dear Emilia; never more
will you &s;ee your wretched &s;i&s;ter, who
flies from the cruel fate now prepared
for her, certain that &s;he can never meet
one more dreadful.&mdash;In happine&s;s or
mi&s;ery&mdash;in hope or de&s;pair&mdash;whatever
may be your &s;ituation&mdash;&s;till remember
me with pity and affection. Dear Emi|lia,
adieu!&mdash;You will always be the
&s;i&s;ter of my heart&mdash;may you never be
the partner of my misfortunes!"</P>
<P>While the marquis was reading this
letter, the marchione&s;s, who &s;uppo&s;ed
the delay occa&s;ioned by &s;ome oppo&s;ition
from Julia, flew to the apartment. By
her orders all the habitable parts of the
ca&s;tle were explored, and &s;he her&s;elf
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;earch. At length the
intelligence was communicated to the
chapel, and the confu&s;ion became uni|ver&s;al.
The prie&s;t quitted the altar,
and the company returned to the &s;aloon.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168">
The letter, when it was given to Emi|lia,
excited emotions which &s;he found
it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;gui&s;e, but which did
not, however, protect her from a &s;u&s;pi|cion
that &s;he was concerned in the tran&s;|action,
her knowledge of which this let|ter
appeared intended to conceal.</P>
<P>The marquis immediately di&s;patched
&s;ervants upon the fleete&s;t hor&s;es of his
&s;tables, with directions to take different
routes, and to &s;cour every corner of the
i&s;land in pur&s;uit of the fugitives. When
the&s;e exertions had &s;omewhat quieted
his mind, he began to con&s;ider by what
means Julia could have effected her e&s;|cape.
She had been confined in a &s;mall
room in a remote part of the ca&s;tle, to
which no per&s;on had been admitted but
her own woman, and Robert, the confi|dential
&s;ervant of the marquis. Even
Li&s;ette had not been &s;uffered to enter,
unle&s;s accompanied by Robert, in who&s;e
room, &s;ince the night of the fatal di&s;|covery,
the keys had been regularly de|po&s;ited.
Without them it was impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="167" REF="169">
&s;he could have e&s;caped; the win|dows
of the apartment being barred
and grated, and opening into an inner
court, at a prodigious height from the
ground. Be&s;ides, who could &s;he de|pend
upon for protection&mdash;or whi|ther
could &s;he intend to fly for con|cealment?&mdash;The
a&s;&s;ociates of her for|mer
elopement were utterly unable to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her even with advice. Ferdinand,
him&s;elf a pri&s;oner, had been deprived
of any means of intercour&s;e with her,
and Hippolitus had been carried life|le&s;s
on board a ve&s;&s;el which had im|mediately
&s;ailed for Italy.</P>
<P>Robert, to whom the keys had been
intru&s;ted, was &s;everely interrogated by
the marquis. He per&s;i&s;ted in a &s;imple
and uniform declaration of his inno|cence;
but as the marquis believed it
impo&s;&s;ible that Julia could have e&s;cap|ed
without his knowledge, he was or|dered
into impri&s;onment till he &s;hould
confe&s;s the fact.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170">
The pride of the duke was &s;everely
wounded by this elopement, which prov|ed
the exce&s;s of Julia's aver&s;ion, and com|pleated
the di&s;graceful circum&s;tances of
his rejection. The marquis had care|fully
concealed from him her prior at|tempt
at elopement, and her con&s;equent
confinement; but the truth now bur&s;t
from di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;tood revealed with
bitter aggravation. The duke, fired
with indignation at the duplicity of the
marquis, powered forth his re&s;entment
in terms of proud and bitter invective;
and the marquis, galled by recent di&s;|appointment,
was in no mood to re|&s;train
the impetuo&s;ity of his nature.
He retorted with acrimony; and the con|&s;equence
would have been &s;erious, had
not the friends of each party interpo&s;ed
for their pre&s;ervation. The di&s;putants
were at length reconciled; it was agreed
to pur&s;ue Julia with united, and inde|fatigable
&s;earch; and that whenever &s;he
&s;hould be found, the nuptials &s;hould be
<PB N="169" REF="171">
&s;olemnized without further delay. With
the character of the duke, this conduct
was con&s;i&s;tent. His pa&s;&s;ions, inflamed
by di&s;appointment, and &s;trengthened
by repul&s;e, now defied the power of
ob&s;tacle; and tho&s;e con&s;iderations which
would have operated with a more deli|cate
mind to overcome its original in|clination,
&s;erved only to encrea&s;e the
violence of his.</P>
<P>Madame de Menon, who loved Julia
with maternal affection, was an intere&s;t|ed
ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;|tle.
The cruel fate to which the mar|quis
de&s;tined his daughter, &s;he had &s;e|verely
lamented, yet &s;he could hardly re|joice
to find that this had been avoided
by elopement. She trembled for the
future &s;afety of her pupil; and her tran|quillity,
which was thus fir&s;t di&s;turbed
for the welfare of others, &s;he was not
&s;oon &s;uffered to recover.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s had long nouri&s;hed
&s;ecret di&s;like to Madame de Menon,
<PB N="170" REF="172">
who&s;e virtues were a &s;ilent reproof to
her vices. The contrariety of their di&s;|po&s;itions,
created in the marchione&s;s an
aver&s;ion which would have amounted
to contempt, had not that dignity of vir|tue
which &s;trongly characterized the
manners of Madame, compelled the
former to fear what &s;he wi&s;hed to de&s;pi&s;e.
Her con&s;cience whi&s;pered her that the
di&s;like was mutual; and &s;he now rejoic|ed
in the opportunity which &s;eemed to
offer it&s;elf, of lowering the proud in|tegrity
of Madame's character. Pre|tending,
therefore, to believe that &s;he
had encouraged Ferdinand to di&s;obey his
father's commands, and had been ac|ce&s;&s;ary
to the elopement, &s;he accu&s;ed
her of the&s;e offences, and &s;timulated the
marquis to reprehend her conduct. But
the integrity of Madame de Menon was
not to be que&s;tioned with impunity.
Without deigning to an&s;wer the impu|tation,
&s;he de&s;ired to re&s;ign an office of
which &s;he was no longer con&s;idered wor|thy,
<PB N="171" REF="173">
and to quit the ca&s;tle immediately.
This the policy of the marquis would not
&s;uffer; and he was compelled to make
&s;uch ample conce&s;&s;ions to Madame, as
induced her for the pre&s;ent to conti|nue
at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The news of Julia's elopement at
length reached the ears of Ferdinand,
who&s;e joy at this event was equalled
only by his &s;urprize. He lo&s;t, for a
moment, the &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ituation,
and thought only of the e&s;cape of Julia.
But his &s;orrow &s;oon returned with ac|cumulated
force when he recollected
that Julia might then perhaps want that
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which his confinement alone
could prevent his affording her.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants, who had been &s;ent in
pur&s;uit, returned to the ca&s;tle without
any &s;atisfactory information. Week
after week elap&s;ed in fruitle&s;s &s;earch,
yet the duke was &s;trenuous in continu|ing
the pur&s;uit. Emi&s;&s;aries were di&s;|patched
to Naples, and to the &s;everal
<PB N="172" REF="174">
e&s;tates of the count Vereza, but they
returned without any &s;atisfactory infor|mation.
The count had not been heard
of &s;ince he quitted Naples for Sicily.</P>
<P>During the&s;e enquiries a new &s;ub|ject
of di&s;turbance broke out in the ca&s;|tle
of Mazzini. On the night &s;o fatal
to the hopes of Hippolitus and Julia,
when the tumult was &s;ub&s;ided, and all
was &s;till, a light was ob&s;erved by a &s;er|vant
as he pa&s;&s;ed by the window of the
great &s;tair-ca&s;e in the way to his cham|ber,
to glimmer through the ca&s;ement
before noticed in the &s;outhern build|ings.
While he &s;tood ob&s;erving it, it
vani&s;hed, and pre&s;ently re-appeared.
The former my&s;terious circum&s;tances
relative to the&s;e buildings ru&s;hed upon
his mind; and fired with wonder, he
rou&s;ed &s;ome of his fellow &s;ervants to
come and behold this phenomenon.</P>
<P>As they gazed in &s;ilent terror, the
light di&s;appeared, and &s;oon after, they
&s;aw a &s;mall door belonging to the &s;outh
<PB N="173" REF="175">
tower open, and a figure bearing a light
i&s;&s;ue forth, which gliding along the ca&s;|tle
walls, was quickly lo&s;t to their view.
Overcome with fear, they hurried back
to their chambers, and revolved all the
late wonderful occurrences. They doubt|ed
not, that this was the figure formerly
&s;een by the lady Julia. The &s;udden
change of Madame de Menon's apart|ments
had not pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved by the
&s;ervants, but they now no longer he&s;ita|ted
to what to attribute the removal. They
collected each various and uncommon
circum&s;tance attendant on this part of
the fabric; and, comparing them with
the pre&s;ent, their &s;uper&s;titious fears were
confirmed, and their terror heightened
to &s;uch a degree, that many of them re|&s;olved
to quit the &s;ervice of the mar|quis.</P>
<P>The marquis &s;urprized at this &s;udden
de&s;ertion, enquired into its cau&s;e, and
learned the truth. Shocked by this di&s;|covery,
he yet re&s;olved to prevent, if
<PB N="174" REF="176">
po&s;&s;ible, the ill effects which might be
expected from a circulation of the re|port.
To this end it was nece&s;&s;ary to
quiet the minds of his people, and to
prevent their quitting his &s;ervice. Hav|ing
&s;everely reprehended them for the
idle apprehen&s;ion they encouraged, he
told them that, to prove the fallacy of
their &s;urmi&s;es, he would lead them over
that part of the ca&s;tle which was the
&s;ubject of their fears, and ordered them
to attend him at the return of night in
the north hall. Emilia and Madame de
Menon &s;urprized at this procedure,
awaited the i&s;&s;ue in &s;ilent expectation.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants in obedience to the com|mands
of the marquis, a&s;&s;embled at
night in the north hall. The air of de|&s;olation
which reigned through the
&s;outh buildings; and the circum&s;tance
of their having been for &s;o many years
&s;hut up, would naturally tend to in&s;pire
awe; but to the&s;e people, who firmly
believed them to be the haunt of an
<PB N="175" REF="177">
unquiet &s;pirit, terror was the predomi|nant
&s;entiment.</P>
<P>The marquis now appeared with the
keys of the&s;e buildings in his hands, and
every heart thrilled with wild expecta|tion.
He ordered Robert to precede him
with a torch, and the re&s;t of the &s;ervants
following, he pa&s;&s;ed on. A pair of iron
gates were unlocked, and they proceed|ed
through a court, who&s;e pavement was
wildly overgrown with long gra&s;s, to
the great door of the &s;outh fabric. Here
they met with &s;ome difficulty, for the
lock, which had not been turned for
many years, was ru&s;ted.</P>
<P>During this interval, the &s;ilence of
expectation &s;ealed the lips of all pre&s;ent.
At length the lock yielded. That door
which had not been pa&s;&s;ed for &s;o many
years, creaked heavily upon its hinges,
and di&s;clo&s;ed the hall of black marble
which Ferdinand had formerly cro&s;&s;ed.
"Now," cried the marquis, in a tone
of irony as he entered, "expect to en|counter
<PB N="176" REF="178">
counter the gho&s;ts of which you tell
me; but if you fail to conquer them,
prepare to quit my &s;ervice. The peo|ple
who live with me, &s;hall at lea&s;t have
courage and ability &s;ufficient to defend
me from the&s;e &s;piritual attacks. All I
apprehend is, that the enemy will not
appear, and in this ca&s;e your valour will
go untried."</P>
<P>No one dared to an&s;wer, but all fol|lowed,
in &s;ilent fear, the marquis, who
a&s;cended the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, and enter|ed
the gallery. "Unlock that door,"
&s;aid he, pointing to one on the left,
"and we will &s;oon unhou&s;e the&s;e
gho&s;ts." Robert applied the key, but
his hand &s;hook &s;o violently that he
could not turn it. "Here is a fellow,"
cried the marquis, "fit to encounter
a whole legion of &s;pirits. Do you,
Anthony, take the key, and try your
valour."</P>
<P>"Plea&s;e you, my lord," replied
Anthony, "I never was a good one at
<PB N="177" REF="179">
unlocking a door in my life, but here
is Gregory will do it." "No, my
lord, an' plea&s;e you," &s;aid Gregory,
here is Richard." "Stand off" &s;aid
the marquis, "I will &s;hame your cow|ardice,
and do it my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Saying this he turned the key, and
was ru&s;hing on, but the door refu&s;ed to
yield; it &s;hook under his hands, and
&s;eemed as if partially held by &s;ome per|&s;on
on the other &s;ide. The marquis was
&s;urprized, and made &s;everal efforts to
move it, without effect. He then order|ed
his &s;ervants to bur&s;t it open, but,
&s;hrinking back with one accord, they
crid "for God's &s;ake, my lord, go no
farther; we are &s;atisfied here are no
gho&s;ts, only let us get back."</P>
<P>"It is now then my turn to be &s;ati&s;|fied,"
replied the marquis, "and till I
am, not one of you &s;hall &s;tir. Open
me that door." "My lord!"&mdash;"Nay,"
&s;aid the marquis, a&s;&s;uming a look of
&s;tern authority&mdash;"di&s;pute not my com|mands.
I am not to be trifled with."</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180">
They now &s;tepped forward, and ap|plied
their &s;trength to the door, when a
loud and &s;udden noi&s;e bur&s;t from with|in,
and re&s;ounded through the hollow
chambers! The men &s;tarted back in af|fright,
and were ru&s;hing headlong down
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, when the voice of the
marquis arre&s;ted their flight. They re|turned
with hearts palpitating with ter|ror.
"Ob&s;erve what I &s;ay," &s;aid the mar|quis,
"and behave like men. Yonder
door," pointing to one at &s;ome di&s;tance,
"will lead us through other rooms to
this chamber&mdash;unlock it therefore, for
I will know the cau&s;e of the&s;e founds."
Shocked at this determination, the &s;er|vants
again &s;upplicated the marquis to
go no farther; and to be obeyed, he
was obliged to exert all his authority.
The door was opened, and di&s;covered a
long narrow pa&s;&s;age, into which they
de&s;cended by a few &s;teps. It led to a
gallery that terminated in a back &s;tair|ca&s;e,
<PB N="179" REF="181">
where &s;everal doors appeared, one
of which the marquis unclo&s;ed. A &s;pa|cious
chamber appeared beyond, who&s;e
walls, decayed and di&s;coloured by the
damps, exhibited a melancholy proof
of de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed on through a long &s;uite
of lofty and noble apartments, which
were in the &s;ame ruinous condition.
At length they came to the chamber
whence the noi&s;e had i&s;&s;ued. "Go
fir&s;t Robert, with the light," &s;aid the
marquis, as they approached the door,
"this is the key." Robert trembled&mdash;but
obeyed, and the other &s;ervants
followed in &s;ilence. They &s;topped a mo|ment
at the door to li&s;ten, but all was
&s;till within. The door was opened, and
di&s;clo&s;ed a large vaulted chamber, near|ly
re&s;embling tho&s;e they had pa&s;&s;ed,
and on looking round, they di&s;covered
at once the cau&s;e of the alarm.&mdash;A part
of the decayed roof was fallen in, and
the &s;tones and rubbi&s;h of the ruin fall|ing
<PB N="180" REF="182">
again&s;t the gallery door, ob&s;tructed
the pa&s;&s;age. It was evident, too, whence
the noi&s;e which occa&s;ioned their terror
had ari&s;en; the loo&s;e &s;tones which were
piled again&s;t the door being &s;hook by
the effort made to open it, had given
way, and rolled to the floor.</P>
<P>After &s;urveying the place, they re|turned
to the back &s;tairs, which they de|&s;cended,
and having pur&s;ued the &s;everal
windings of a long pa&s;&s;age, found them|&s;elves
again in the marble hall. "Now,"
&s;aid the marquis, "what think ye?&mdash;What
evil &s;pirits infe&s;t the&s;e walls?
Henceforth be cautions how ye credit
the phanta&s;ms of idlene&s;s, for ye may
not always meet with a ma&s;ter who
will conde&s;cend to undeceive ye." They
acknowledged the goodne&s;s of the mar|quis,
and profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves per|fectly
con&s;cious of the error of their
former &s;u&s;picions, de&s;ired they might
&s;earch no farther. "I chu&s;e to leave
nothing to your imagination," replied
<PB N="181" REF="183">
the marquis, le&s;t hereafter it &s;hould be|tray
you into a &s;imilar error. Follow
me, therefore; you &s;hall &s;ee the whole
of the&s;e buildings." Saying this he
led them to the &s;outh tower. They re|membered,
that from a door of this
tower, the figure which cau&s;ed their
alarm had i&s;&s;ued; and notwith&s;tanding
the late a&s;&s;ertion of their &s;u&s;picions
being removed, fear &s;till operated pow|erfully
upon their minds, and they
would willingly have been excu&s;ed
from farther re&s;earch. "Would any
of you chu&s;e to explore this tower?"
&s;aid the marquis, pointing to the bro|ken
&s;tair-ca&s;e; "for my&s;elf I am mor|tal,
and therefore fear to venture, but
you who hold communion with di&s;em|bodied
&s;pirits, may partake &s;omething
of their nature, if &s;o, you may pa&s;s with|out
apprehen&s;ion where the gho&s;t has
probably pa&s;&s;ed before." They &s;hrunk
at this reproof, and were &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The marquis, turning to a door on
<PB N="182" REF="184">
his right hand, ordered it to be unlock|ed.
It opened upon the country, and
the &s;ervants knew it to be the &s;ame
whence the figure had appeared. Hav|ing
re-locked it, "Lift that trap-door,
we will de&s;cend into the vaults," &s;aid
the marquis. "What trap-door, my
lord?" &s;aid Robert, with encrea&s;ed agi|tation,
"I &s;ee none." The marquis point|ed,
and Robert perceived a door which
lay almo&s;t concealed beneath the &s;tones
that had fallen from the &s;tair-ca&s;e above.
He began to remove them, when the
marquis &s;uddenly turning, "I have al|ready
&s;ufficiently indulged your folly,"
&s;aid he, "and am weary of this bu&s;ine&s;s.
If you are capable of receiving convic|tion
from truth, you mu&s;t now be con|vinced
that the&s;e buildings are not the
haunt of a &s;uper-natural being; and if
you are incapable, it would be entirely
u&s;ele&s;s to proceed. You, Robert, may
therefore &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of
removing the rubbi&s;h; we will quit this
part of the fabric."</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185">
The &s;ervants joyfully obeyed, and the
marquis locking the &s;everal doors, re|turned
with the keys to the habitable
part of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Every enquiry after Julia had hitherto
proved fruitle&s;s, and the imperious na|ture
of the marquis, heightened by the
pre&s;ent vexation, became intolerably
oppre&s;&s;ive to all around him. As the
hope of recovering Julia declined, his
opinion that Emilia had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to
e&s;cape &s;trengthened, and he inflicted
upon her the &s;everity of his unju&s;t &s;u&s;|picions.
She was ordered to confine
her&s;elf to her apartment till her inno|cence
&s;hould be cleared, or her &s;i&s;ter
di&s;covered. From Madame de Menon
&s;he received a faithful &s;ympathy, which
was the &s;ole relief of her oppre&s;&s;ed
heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia
daily encrea&s;ed, and was heightened
into the mo&s;t terrifying apprehen&s;ions
for her &s;afety. She knew of no per&s;on
in whom her &s;i&s;ter could confide, or of
<PB N="184" REF="186">
any place where &s;he could find protec|tion;
the mo&s;t deplorable evils were
therefore to be expected.</P>
<P>One day as &s;he was &s;itting at the win|dow
of her apartment, engaged in me|lancholy
reflection, &s;he &s;aw a man ri|ding
towards the ca&s;tle on full &s;peed.
Her heart beat with fear and expecta|tion,
for his ha&s;te made her &s;u&s;pect he
brought intelligence of Julia, and &s;he
could &s;carcely refrain from breaking
through the command of the marquis,
and ru&s;hing into the hall to learn &s;ome|thing
of his errand. She was right in
her conjecture; the per&s;on &s;he had &s;een
was a &s;py of the marquis's, and came to
inform him that the lady Julia was at that
time concealed in a cottage of the fore&s;t
of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced
at this intelligence, and gave the man a
liberal reward. He learned al&s;o, that
&s;he was accompanied by a young cava|lier,
which circum&s;tance &s;urprized him
exceedingly, for he knew of no per&s;on
<PB N="185" REF="187">
except the count de Vereza with whom
&s;he could have entru&s;ted her&s;elf, and
the count had fallen by his &s;word! He
immediately ordered a party of his peo|ple
to accompany the me&s;&s;enger to the
fore&s;t of Marentino, and to &s;uffer nei|ther
Julia nor the cavalier to e&s;cape
them on pain of death.</P>
<P>When the duke de Luovo was in|formed
of this di&s;covery, he entreated
and obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the marquis
to join in the pur&s;uit. He immediately
&s;et out on the expedition, armed, and
followed by a number of his &s;ervants.
He re&s;olved to encounter all hazards,
and to practi&s;e the mo&s;t de&s;perate ex|tremes
rather than fail in the object of
his enterprize. In a &s;hort time he over|took
the marquis's people, and they
proceeded together with all po&s;&s;ible
&s;peed. The fore&s;t lay &s;everal leagues
di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle of Mazzini, and
the day was clo&s;ing when they entered
upon the borders. The thick foliage
<PB N="186" REF="188">
of the trees &s;pread a deeper &s;hade
around, and they were obliged to pro|ceed
with caution. Darkne&s;s had long
fallen upon the earth when they reach|ed
the cottage, to which they were di|rected
by a light that glimmered from
afar among the trees. The duke left
his people at &s;ome di&s;tance; and di&s;|mounting,
and accompanied only by
one &s;ervant, approached the cottage.
When he reached it he &s;topped, and
looking through the window ob&s;erved a
man and woman in the habit of pea&s;ants
&s;eated at their &s;upper. They were con|ver&s;ing
with earne&s;tne&s;s, and the duke,
hoping to obtain farther intelligence of
Julia, endeavoured to li&s;ten to their di&s;|cour&s;e.
They were prai&s;ing the beauty
of a lady whom the duke did not doubt
to be Julia, and the woman &s;poke much
in prai&s;e of the cavalier. "He has a
noble heart," &s;aid &s;he, "and I am &s;ure
by his look belongs to &s;ome great fa|mily."
"Nay," replied her compa|nion,
<PB N="187" REF="189">
"the lady is as good as he. I
have been at Palermo, and ought to
know what great folks are, and if &s;he is
not one of them, never take my word
again. Poor thing, how &s;he does take
on! It made my heart ach to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>They were &s;ome time &s;ilent. The
duke knocked at the door, and enquir|ed
of the man who opened it concerning
the lady and cavalier then in his cot|tage.
He was a&s;&s;ured there were no
other per&s;ons in the cottage than tho&s;e
he then &s;aw. The duke per&s;i&s;ted in
affirming that the per&s;ons he enquired
for were there concealed, which the
man being as re&s;olute in denying, he
gave the &s;ignal, and his people ap|proached,
and &s;urrounded the cottage.
The pea&s;ants, terrified by this circum|&s;tance,
confe&s;&s;ed that a lady and cava|lier,
&s;uch as the duke de&s;cribed, had
been for &s;ome time concealed in the
cottage, but that they were now de|parted.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
Su&s;picious of the truth of the latter
a&s;&s;ertion, the duke ordered his people
to &s;earch the cottage, and that part of
the fore&s;t contiguous to it. The &s;earch
ended in di&s;appointment. The duke,
however, re&s;olved to obtain all po&s;&s;ible
information concerning the fugitives;
and a&s;&s;uming, therefore, a &s;tern air,
bade the pea&s;ant, on pain of in&s;tant
death, di&s;cover all he knew of them.</P>
<P>The man replied, that on a very dark
and &s;tormy night, about a week before,
two per&s;ons had come to the cottage,
and de&s;ired &s;helter. That they were
unattended, but &s;eemed to be per&s;ons
of con&s;equence in di&s;gui&s;e. That they
paid very liberally for what they had,
and that they departed from the cot|tage
a few hours before the arrival of
the duke.</P>
<P>The duke enquired concerning the
cour&s;e they had taken, and having re|ceived
information, re-mounted his
hor&s;e, and &s;et forward in pur&s;uit. The
<PB N="189" REF="191">
road lay for &s;everal leagues through the
fore&s;t, and the darkne&s;s, and the pro|bability
of encountering banditti, made
the journey dangerous. About the
break of day, they quitted the fore&s;t,
and entered upon a wild and moun|tainous
country, in which they travelled
&s;ome miles without perceiving a hut,
or a human being. No ve&s;tige of cul|tivation
appeared, and no &s;ounds reach|ed
them but tho&s;e of their hor&s;es feet,
and the roaring of the winds through
the deep fore&s;ts that overhung the
mountains. The pur&s;uit was uncertain,
but the duke re&s;olved to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>They came at length to a cottage,
where he repeated his enquiries, and
learned to his &s;atisfaction that two per|&s;ons,
&s;uch as he de&s;cribed, had &s;topped
there for refre&s;hment about two hours
before. He found it now nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;top for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Bread and
milk, the only provi&s;ions of the place,
were &s;et before him, and his attendants
<PB N="190" REF="192">
would have been well contented, had
there been &s;ufficient of this homely fare
to have &s;atisfied their hunger.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched an ha&s;ty meal,
they again &s;et forward in the way
pointed out to them as the route of the
fugitives. The country a&s;&s;umed a more
civilized a&s;pect. Corn, vineyards, olives,
and groves of mulberry trees adorned
the hills. The vallies, luxuriant in
&s;hade, were frequently embelli&s;hed by
the windings of a lucid &s;tream, and di|ver&s;ified
by clu&s;ters of half-&s;een cotta|ges.
Here the ri&s;ing turrets of a mo|na&s;tery
appeared above the thick trees
with which they were &s;urrounded; and
there the &s;avage wilds, the travellers
had pa&s;&s;ed, formed a bold and pictu|re&s;que
back-ground to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>To the que&s;tions put by the duke to
the &s;everal per&s;ons he met, he received
an&s;wers that encouraged him to pro|ceed.
At noon he halted at a village to
refre&s;h him&s;elf and his people. He
<PB N="191" REF="193">
could gain no intelligence of Julia, and
was perplexed which way to chu&s;e;
but determined at length to pur&s;ue the
road he was then in, and accordingly
again &s;et forward. He travelled &s;eve|ral
miles without meeting any per&s;on
who could give the nece&s;&s;ary informa|tion,
and began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s.
The lengthened &s;hadows of the moun|tains,
and the fading light gave &s;ignals of
declining day; when having gained the
&s;ummit of a high hill, he ob&s;erved two
per&s;ons travelling on hor&s;e-back in the
plains below. On one of them he di&s;|tingui&s;hed
the habiliments of a woman;
and in her air he thought he di&s;covered
that of Julia. While he &s;tood atten|tively
&s;urveying them, they looked tow|ards
the hill, when, as if urged by a
&s;udden impul&s;e of terror, they &s;et off on
full &s;peed over the plains. The duke
had no doubt that the&s;e were the per|&s;ons
he &s;ought; and he, therefore, or|dered
&s;ome of his people to pur&s;ue
<PB N="192" REF="194">
them, and pu&s;hed his hor&s;e into a full
gallop. Before he reached the plains,
the fugitives, winding round an abrupt
hill, were lo&s;t to his view. The duke
continued his cour&s;e, and his people,
who were a con&s;iderable way before him,
at length reached the hill, behind which
the two per&s;ons had di&s;appeared. No
traces of them were to be &s;een, and they
entered a narrow defile between two
ranges of high, and &s;avage mountains;
on the right of which a rapid &s;tream
rolled along, and broke with its deep
re&s;ounding murmurs the &s;olemn &s;ilence
of the place. The &s;hades of evening
now fell thick, and the &s;cene was &s;oon
enveloped in darkne&s;s; but to the duke,
who was animated by a &s;trong and im|petuous
pa&s;&s;ion, the&s;e were unimport|ant
circum&s;tances. Although he knew
that the wilds of Sicily were frequently
infe&s;ted with banditti, his numbers
made him fearle&s;s of attack. Not &s;o
his attendants, many of whom, as the
<PB N="193" REF="195">
darkne&s;s increa&s;ed, te&s;tified emotions
not very honourable to their courage;
&s;tarting at every bu&s;h, and believing it
concealed a murderer. They endea|voured
to di&s;&s;uade the duke from pro|ceeding,
expre&s;&s;ing uncertainty of their
being in the right route, and recom|mending
the open plains. But the duke,
who&s;e eye had been vigilant to mark
the flight of the fugitives, and who
was not to be di&s;&s;uaded from his pur|po&s;e,
quickly repre&s;&s;ed their argu|ments.
They continued their cour&s;e
without meeting a &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>
<P>The moon now ro&s;e, and afforded
them a &s;hadowy imperfect view of the
&s;urrounding objects. The pro&s;pect was
gloomy and va&s;t, and not a human ha|bitation
met their eyes. They had now
lo&s;t every trace of the &s;ugitives, and
found them&s;elves bewildered in a wild
and &s;avage country. Their only re|maining
care was to extricate them&s;elves
from &s;o forlorn a &s;ituation, and they li&s;|tened
<PB N="194" REF="196">
at every &s;tep with anxious atten|tion,
for &s;ome &s;ound that might di&s;co|ver
to them the haunts of men. They
li&s;tened in vain; the &s;tillne&s;s of night
was undi&s;turbed but by the wind, which
broke at intervals in low and hollow
murmers from among the mountains.</P>
<P>As they proceeded with &s;ilent caution,
they perceived a light break from among
the rocks at &s;ome di&s;tance. The duke
he&s;itated whether to approach, &s;ince it
might probably proceed from a party
of the banditti with which the&s;e moun|tains
were &s;aid to be infe&s;ted. While
he he&s;itated, it di&s;appeared; but he had
not advanced many &s;teps when it re|turned.
He now perceived it i&s;&s;ue from
the mouth of a cavern, and ca&s;t a bright
reflection upon the overhanging rocks
and &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>He di&s;mounted, and followed by two
of his people, leaving the re&s;t at &s;ome
di&s;tance, moved with &s;low and &s;ilent
&s;teps towards the cave. As he drew
<PB N="195" REF="197">
near he heard the &s;ound of many voices
in high carou&s;al. Suddenly the up|roar
cea&s;ed, and the following words
were &s;ung by a clear and manly voice:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Pour the rich libation high,</L>
<L>The &s;parkling cup to Bacchus fill;</L>
<L>His joys &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> in ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>And chace the forms of future ill!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quick the magic raptures &s;teal</L>
<L>O'er the fancy kindling brain;</L>
<L>Warm the heart with &s;ocial zeal,</L>
<L>And &s;ong and laughter reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then vi&s;ions of plea&s;ure &s;hall float on our &s;ight,</L>
<L>While light bounding our &s;pirits &s;hall flow;</L>
<L>And the god &s;hall impart a fine &s;en&s;e of delight</L>
<L>Which in vain <HI>&s;ober</HI> mortals would know.</L>
</LG>
</LG>
<P>The la&s;t ver&s;e was repeated in loud
chorus. The duke li&s;tened with a&s;to|ni&s;hment!
Such &s;ocial merriment, amid
a &s;cene of &s;uch &s;avage wildne&s;s, appear|ed
more like enchantment than reality.
He would not have he&s;itated to pro|nounce
this a party of banditti, had not
<PB N="196" REF="198">
the delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion pre&s;erved in
the &s;ong, appeared unattainable by men
of their cla&s;s.</P>
<P>He had now a full view of the cave,
and the moment which convinced him
of his error, &s;erved al&s;o to encrea&s;e his
&s;urprize. He beheld by the light of a
fire, a party of banditti &s;eated within
the deepe&s;t rece&s;s of the cave, round a
rude kind of table formed in the rock.
The table was &s;pread with provi&s;ions,
and they were regaling them&s;elves with
great eagerne&s;s and joy. The coun|tenances
of the men exhibited a &s;trange
mixture of fiercene&s;s and &s;ociality; and
the duke could almo&s;t have imagined
he beheld in the&s;e robbers a band of
the early Romans before knowledge had
civilized, or luxury had &s;oftened them.
But he had not much time for medita|tion&mdash;a
&s;en&s;e of his danger bade him fly,
while to fly was yet in his power.</P>
<P>As he turned to depart, he ob&s;erved
two &s;addle hor&s;es grazing upon the her|bage
<PB N="197" REF="199">
near the mouth of the cave. It
in&s;tantly occurred to him that they be|longed
to Julia, and her companion.
He he&s;itated, and at length determined
to linger awhile, and li&s;ten to the con|ver&s;ation
of the robbers, hoping from
thence to have his doubts re&s;olved.
They talked for &s;ome time in a &s;train
of high conviviality, and recounted in
exultation many of their exploits. They
de&s;cribed al&s;o the behaviour of &s;eve|ral
people whom they had robbed, with
highly ludicrous allu&s;ions, and with
much rude humour; while the cave re|echoed
with loud bur&s;ts of laughter
and applau&s;e. They were thus engag|ed
in tumultuous merriment, till one of
them cur&s;ing the &s;canty plunder of their
late adventure, but prai&s;ing the beauty
of a lady, they all lowered their voices
together, and &s;eemed as if debating
upon a point uncommonly intere&s;ting
to them. The pa&s;&s;ions of the duke were
rou&s;ed, and he became certain that it
<PB N="198" REF="200">
was Julia of whom they had &s;poken.
In the fir&s;t impu&s;e of feeling, he drew
his &s;word; but recollecting the number
of his adver&s;aries, re&s;trained his fury.
He was turning from the cave, with a
de&s;ign of &s;ummoning his people, when
the light of the fire glittering upon the
bright blade of his weapon, caught the
eye of one of the banditti. He &s;tarted
from his &s;eat, and his comrades in&s;tantly
ri&s;ing in con&s;ternation, di&s;covered the
duke. They ru&s;hed with loud vocife|ration
towards the mouth of the cave.
He endeavoured to e&s;cape to his peo|ple;
but two of the banditti mounting
the hor&s;es which were grazing near,
quickly overtook and &s;eized him. His
dre&s;s and air proclaimed him to be a
per&s;on of di&s;tinction, and rejoicing in
their pro&s;pect of plunder, they forced
him towards the cave. Here their com|rades
awaited them, but what were the
emotions of the duke, when he di&s;co|vered
in the per&s;on of the principal rob|ber,

his own &s;on! who, to e&s;cape the
galling &s;everity of his father, had fled
from his ca&s;tle &s;ome years before, and
had not been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>He had placed him&s;elf at the head of
a party of banditti, and plea&s;ed with
the liberty which till then he had never
ta&s;ted, and with the power which his
new &s;ituation afforded him, he became
&s;o much attached to this wild and law|le&s;s
mode of life, that he determined
never to quit it till death &s;hould di&s;&s;olve
tho&s;e ties which now made his rank only
oppre&s;&s;ive. This event &s;eemed at &s;o
great a di&s;tance, that he &s;eldom allowed
him&s;elf to think of it. Whenever it
&s;hould happen, he had no doubt that he
might either re&s;ume his rank without
danger of di&s;covery, or might ju&s;tify
his pre&s;ent conduct as a frolick which a
few acts of genero&s;ity would ea&s;ily ex|cu&s;e.
He knew his power would then
place him beyond the reach of cen&s;ure,
in a country where the people are ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="200" REF="202">
to implicit &s;ubordination, and
&s;eldom dare to &s;erutinize the actions of
the nobility.</P>
<P>His &s;en&s;ations, however, on di&s;cover|ing
his father, were not very plea&s;ing;
but proclaiming the duke, he protected
him from farther outrage.</P>
<P>With the duke, who&s;e heart was a
&s;tranger to the &s;ofter affections, indigna|tion
u&s;urped the place of parental feel|ing.
His pride was the only pa&s;&s;ion
affected by the di&s;covery; and he had
the ra&s;hne&s;s to expre&s;s the indignation,
which the conduct of his &s;on had exci|ted,
in terms of unre&s;trained invective.
The banditti, inflamed by the oppro|brium
with which he loaded their order,
threatened in&s;tant puni&s;hment to his te|merity;
and the authority of Riccardo
could hardly re&s;train them within the
limits of forbearance.</P>
<P>The menaces, and at length entrea|ties,
of the duke, to prevail with his &s;on
to abandon his pre&s;ent way of life, were
<PB N="201" REF="203">
equally ineffectual. Secure in his own
power, Riccardo laughed at the fir&s;t,
and was in&s;en&s;ible to the latter; and his
father was compelled to relinqui&s;h the
attempt. The duke, however, boldly
and pa&s;&s;ionately accu&s;ed him of having
plundered and &s;ecreted a lady and ca|valier,
his friends, at the &s;ame time de&s;|cribing
Julia, for who&s;e liberation he
offered large rewards. Riccardo deni|ed
the fact, which &s;o much exa&s;perated
the duke, that he drew his &s;word with
an intention of plunging it in the brea&s;t
of his &s;on. His arm was arre&s;ted by
the &s;urrounding banditti, who half un|&s;heathed
their &s;words, and &s;tood &s;u&s;|pended
in an attitude of menace. The
fate of the father now hung upon the
voice of the &s;on. Riccardo rai&s;ed his
arm, but in&s;tantly dropped it, and turn|ed
away. The banditti &s;heathed their
weapons, and &s;tepped back.</P>
<P>Riccardo &s;olemnly &s;wearing that he
knew nothing of the per&s;ons de&s;cribed,
<PB N="202" REF="204">
the duke at length became convinced
of the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, and de|parting
from the cave, rejoined his peo|ple.
All the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions of his
nature were rou&s;ed and inflamed by the
di&s;covery of his &s;on, in a &s;ituation &s;o
wretchedly di&s;graceful. Yet it was his
pride rather than his virtue that was
hurt; and when he wi&s;hed him dead, it
was rather to &s;ave him&s;elf from di&s;|grace,
than his &s;on from the real indig|nity
of vice. He had no means of
reclaiming him; to have attempted
it by force, would have been at this
time the exce&s;s of temerity, for his at|tendants,
though numerous, were un|di&s;ciplined,
and would have fallen cer|tain
victims to the power of a &s;avage
and dexterous banditti.</P>
<P>With thoughts agitated in fierce and
agonizing conflict, he pur&s;ued his jour|ney;
and having lo&s;t all trace of Julia,
&s;ought only for an habitation which
might &s;helter him from the night, and
<PB N="203" REF="205">
afford nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment for him|&s;elf

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE night grew &s;tormy. The hol|low
winds &s;wept over the moun|tains,
and blew bleak and cold around;
the clouds were driven &s;wiftly over the
face of the moon, and the duke and his
people were frequently involved in to|tal
darkne&s;s. They had travelled on
&s;ilently and dejectedly for &s;ome hours,
and were bewildered in the wilds, when
they &s;uddenly heard the bell of a mo|na&s;tery
chiming for midnight prayer.
Their hearts revived at the &s;ound, which
they endeavoured to follow, but they
had not gone far, when the gale wafted
it away, and they were abandoned to the
uncertain guide of their own conjec|tures.</P>
<P>They had pur&s;ued for &s;ome time the
way which they judged led to the mo|na&s;tery,
when the note of the bell re|turned
upon the wind, and di&s;covered
<PB N="205" REF="207">
to them that they had mi&s;taken their
route. After much wandering and dif|ficulty
they arrived, overcome with
wearine&s;s, at the gates of a large and
gloomy fabric. The bell had cea&s;ed,
and all was &s;till. By the moon-light,
which through broken clouds now
&s;treamed upon the building, they be|came
convinced it was the mona&s;tery
they had &s;ought, and the duke him&s;elf
&s;truck loudly upon the gate.</P>
<P>Several minutes elap&s;ed, no per&s;on
appeared, and he repeated the &s;troke.
A &s;tep was pre&s;ently heard within, the
gate was unbarred, and a thin &s;hivering
figure pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The duke &s;oli|cited
admi&s;&s;ion, but was refu&s;ed, and
reprimanded for di&s;turbing the convent
at the hour &s;acred to prayer. He
then made known his rank, and bade
the friar inform the Superior that he
reque&s;ted &s;helter from the night. The
friar, &s;u&s;picious of deceit, and appre|hen&s;ive
of robbers, refu&s;ed with much
<PB N="206" REF="208">
firmne&s;s, and repeated that the convent
was engaged in prayer; he had almo&s;t
clo&s;ed the gate, when the duke, whom
hunger and fatigue made de&s;perate,
ru&s;hed by him, and pa&s;&s;ed into the court.
It was his intention to pre&s;ent him&s;elf
to the Superior, and he had not pro|ceeded
far when the &s;ound of laughter,
and of many voices in loud and mirth|ful
jollity, attracted his &s;teps. It led
him through &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages to a door,
through the crevices of which light ap|peared.
He pau&s;ed a moment, and
heard within a wild uproar of merriment
and &s;ong. He was &s;truck with a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
and could &s;carcely credit his
&s;en&s;es!</P>
<P>He unclo&s;ed the door, and beheld in
a large room, well lighted, a company
of friars, dre&s;t in the habit of their
order, placed round a table, which was
profu&s;ely &s;pread with wines and fruits.
The Superior, who&s;e habit di&s;tingui&s;hed
him from his a&s;&s;ociates, appeared at the
<PB N="207" REF="209">
head of the table. He was lifting a
large goblet of wine to his lips, and was
roaring out, "Profu&s;ion and confu&s;ion,"
at the moment when the duke entered.
His appearance cau&s;ed a general alarm;
that part of the company who were not
too much intoxicated, aro&s;e from their
&s;eats; and the Superior, dropping the
goblet from his hands, endeavoured to
a&s;&s;ume a look of au&s;terity, which his
ro&s;y countenance belied. The duke re|ceived
a reprimand, delivered in the
li&s;ping accents of intoxication, and em|belli&s;hed
with frequent interjections of
hiccup. He made known his qua|lity,
his di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;olicited a night's
lodging for him&s;elf and his people.
When the Superior under&s;tood the di&s;|tinction
of his gue&s;t, his features relaxed
into a &s;mile of joyous welcome; and ta|king
him by the hand, he placed him
by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>The table was quickly covered with
luxurious provi&s;ions, and orders were
<PB N="208" REF="210">
given that the duke's people &s;hould be
admitted, and taken care of. He was
regaled with a variety of the fine&s;t wines,
and at length, highly elevated by mo|na&s;tic
ho&s;pitality, he retired to the apart|ment
allotted him, leaving the Superior
in a condition which precluded all cere|mony.</P>
<P>He departed in the morning, very
well plea&s;ed with the accommodating
principles of mona&s;tic religion. He
had been told that the enjoyment of the
good things of this life was the &s;ure&s;t
&s;ign of our gratitude to Heaven; and
it appeared, that within the walls of a
Sicilian mona&s;tery, the precept and the
practice were equally enforced.</P>
<P>He was now at a lo&s;s what cour&s;e to
chu&s;e, for he had no clue to direct him
towards the object of his pur&s;uit; but
hope &s;till invigorated, and urged him
to per&s;everance. He was not many
leagues from the coa&s;t; and it occurred
to him, that the fugitives might make
<PB N="209" REF="211">
towards it with a de&s;ign of e&s;caping
into Italy. He therefore determined to
travel towards the &s;ea, and proceed along
the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At the hou&s;e where he &s;topped to
dine, he learned that two per&s;ons, &s;uch
he de&s;cribed, had halted there about an
hour before his arrival, and had &s;et off
again in much &s;eeming ha&s;te. They
had taken the road towards the coa&s;t,
whence it was obvious to the duke they
de&s;igned to embark. He &s;tayed not to
fini&s;h the repa&s;t &s;et before him, but in|&s;tantly
re-mounted to continue the pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P>To the enquiries he made of the per|&s;ons
he chanced to meet, favourable an|&s;wers
were returned for a time, but he
was at length bewildered in uncertainty,
and travelled for &s;ome hours in a direc|tion
which chance, rather than judg|ment,
prompted him to take.</P>
<P>The falling evening again con|fu&s;ed
his pro&s;pects, and un&s;ettled his
<PB N="210" REF="212">
hopes. The &s;hades were deepened by
thick and heavy clouds that enveloped
the horizon, and the deep &s;ounding air
foretold a tempe&s;t. The thunder now
rolled at a di&s;tance, and the accumu|lated
clouds grew darker. The duke
and his people were on a wild and
dreary heath, round which they looked
in vain for &s;helter, the view being termi|nated
on all &s;ides by the &s;ame de&s;olate
&s;cene. They rode, however, as hard
as their hor&s;es would carry them; and
at length one of the attendants e&s;pied
on the &s;kirts of the wa&s;te a large man|&s;ion,
towards which they immediately
directed their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>They were overtaken by the &s;torm,
and at the moment when they reached
the building, a peal of thunder, which
&s;eemed to &s;hake the pile, bur&s;t over
their heads. They now found them|&s;elves
in a large and ancient man&s;ion,
which &s;eemed totally de&s;erted, and
was falling to decay. The edifice was
<PB N="211" REF="213">
di&s;tingui&s;hed by an air of magnificence,
which ill accorded with the &s;urround|ing
&s;cenery, and which excited &s;ome
degree of &s;urprize in the mind of the
duke, who, however fully ju&s;tified the
owner in for&s;aking a &s;pot, which pre|&s;ented
to the eye only views of rude
and de&s;olated nature.</P>
<P>The &s;torm encrea&s;ed with much vio|lence,
and threatened to detain the duke
a pri&s;oner in his pre&s;ent habitation for
the night. The hall, of which he and
his people had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, exhi|bited
in every feature marks of ruin and
de&s;olation. The marble pavement was
in many places broken, the walls were
mouldering in decay, and round the
high and &s;hattered windows the long
gra&s;s waved to the lonely gale. Curio|&s;ity
led him to explore the rece&s;&s;es of
the man&s;ion. He quitted the hall, and
entered upon a pa&s;&s;age which conducted
him to a remote part of the edifice. He
wandered through the wild and &s;pacious
<PB N="212" REF="214">
apartments in gloomy meditation, and
often pau&s;ed in wonder at the remains
of magnificence which he beheld.</P>
<P>The man&s;ion was irregular and va&s;t,
and he was bewildered in its intricacies.
In endeavouring to find his way back,
he only perplexed him&s;elf more, till at
length he arrived at a door, which he
believed led into the hall he fir&s;t quitted.
On opening it, he di&s;covered by the
faint light of the moon, a large place,
which he &s;carcely knew whether to
think a cloi&s;ter, a chapel, or a hall.
It retired in long per&s;pective, in arches,
and terminated in a large iron gate,
through which appeared the open coun|try.</P>
<P>The lightenings fla&s;hed thick and
blue around, which together with the
thunder, that &s;eemed to rend the wide
arch of Heaven, and the melancholy
a&s;pect of the place, &s;o awed the duke,
that he involuntarily called to his peo|ple.
His voice was an&s;wered only
<PB N="213" REF="215">
by the deep echoes which ran in
murmurs through the place, and died
away at di&s;tance; and the moon now
&s;inking behind a cloud, left him in total
darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>He repeated the call more loudly,
and at length heard the approach of
foot&s;teps. A few moments relieved
him from his anxiety, for his people
appeared. The &s;torm was yet loud, and
the heavy and &s;ulphureous appearance
of the atmo&s;phere promi&s;ed no &s;peedy
abatement of it. The duke endeavoured
to reconcile him&s;elf to pa&s;s the night in
his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and ordered a fire
to be lighted in the place he was in.
This with much difficulty was accom|pli&s;hed.
He then threw him&s;elf on the
pavement before it, and tried to endure
the ab&s;tinence which he had &s;o ill ob|&s;erved
in the mona&s;tery on the preced|ing
night. But to his great joy his at|tendants
more provident than him&s;elf,
had not &s;crupled to accept a comforta|ble
<PB N="214" REF="216">
quantity of provi&s;ions which had
been offered them at the mona&s;tery;
and which they now drew forth from a
wallet. They were &s;pread upon the pave|ment;
and the duke, after refre&s;hing
him&s;elf, delivered up the remains to his
people. Having ordered them to watch
by turns at the gate, he wrapt his cloak
round him, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The night pa&s;&s;ed without any di&s;|turbance.
The morning aro&s;e fre&s;h
and bright; the Heavens exhibited a
clear and unclouded concave; even the
wild heath, refre&s;hed by the late rains,
&s;miled around, and &s;ent up with the
morning gale a &s;tream of fragrance.</P>
<P>The duke quitted the man&s;ion, re|animated
by the cheerfulne&s;s of morn,
and pur&s;ued his journey. He could
gain no intelligence of the fugitives.
About noon he found him&s;elf in a beau|tifully
romantic country; and having
reached the &s;ummit of &s;ome wild cliffs,
<PB N="215" REF="217">
he re&s;ted to view the picture&s;que ima|gery
of the &s;cene below. A &s;hadowy
&s;eque&s;tered dell appeared buried deep
among the rocks, and in the bottom was
&s;een a lake, who&s;e clear bo&s;om reflected
the impending cliffs, and the beautiful
luxuriance of the overhanging &s;hades.</P>
<P>But his attention was quickly called
from the beauties of inanimate nature,
to objects more intere&s;ting; for he ob|&s;erved
two per&s;ons, whom he in&s;tantly
recollected to be the &s;ame that he had
formerly pur&s;ued over the plains. They
were &s;eated on the margin of the lake,
under the &s;hade of &s;ome high trees at
the foot of the rocks, and &s;eemed par|taking
of a repa&s;t which was &s;pread
upon the gra&s;s. Two hor&s;es were gra|zing
near. In the lady the duke &s;aw the
very air and &s;hape of Julia, and his
heart bounded at the &s;ight. They were
&s;eated with their backs to the cliffs
upon which the duke &s;tood, and he
therefore &s;urveyed them unob&s;erved.
<PB N="216" REF="218">
They were now almo&s;t within his pow|er,
but the difficulty was how to de&s;|cend
the rocks, who&s;e &s;tupendous
heights, and craggy &s;teeps &s;eemed to
render them impa&s;&s;ible. He examined
them with a &s;crutinizing eye, and at
length e&s;pied, where the rock receded,
a narrow winding &s;ort of path. He
di&s;mounted, and &s;ome of his attendants
doing the &s;ame, followed their lord
down the cliffs, treading lightly, le&s;t
their &s;teps &s;hould betray them. Imme|diately
upon their reaching the bottom,
they were perceived by the lady, who
fled among the rocks, and was pre&s;ent|ly
pur&s;ued by the duke's people. The
cavalier had no time to e&s;cape, but
drew his &s;word, and defended him&s;elf
again&s;t the furious a&s;&s;ault of the duke.</P>
<P>The combat was &s;u&s;tained with much
vigour and dexterity on both &s;ides for
&s;ome minutes, when the duke received
the point of his adver&s;ary's &s;word, and
fell. The cavalier, endeavouring to e&s;|cape,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
was &s;eized by the duke's people,
who now appeared with the fair fugi|tive;&mdash;but
what was the di&s;appointment&mdash;the
rage of the duke, when in the
per&s;on of the lady he di&s;covered a &s;tran|ger!
The a&s;toni&s;hment was mutual, but
the accompanying feelings were, in the
different per&s;ons, of a very oppo&s;ite na|ture.
In the duke, a&s;toni&s;hment was
heightened by vexation, and embittered
by di&s;appointment:&mdash;in the lady, it was
&s;oftened by the joy of unexpected deli|verance.</P>
<P>This lady was the younger daughter
of a Sicilian nobleman, who&s;e avarice,
or nece&s;&s;ities, had devoted her to a con|vent.
To avoid the threatened fate, &s;he
fled with the lover to whom her affec|tions
had long been engaged, and who&s;e
only fault, even in the eye of her father,
was inferiority of birth. They were now
on their way to the coa&s;t, whence they
de&s;igned to pa&s;s over to Italy, where
the church would confirm the bonds
<PB N="218" REF="220">
which their hearts had already formed.
There the friends of the cavalier re&s;ided,
and with them they expected to find a
&s;ecure retreat.</P>
<P>The duke, who was not materially
wounded, after the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his
rage had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;uffered them to de|part.
Relieved from their fears, they
joyfully &s;et forward, leaving their late
pur&s;uer to the angui&s;h of defeat, and
fruitle&s;s endeavour. He was remounted
on his hor&s;e; and having di&s;patched two
of his people in &s;earch of a hou&s;e where
he might obtain &s;ome relief, he pro|ceeded
&s;lowly on his return to the ca&s;tle
of Mazzini.</P>
<P>It was not long ere he recollected a
circum&s;tance which, in the fir&s;t tumult
of his di&s;appointment, had e&s;caped him,
but which &s;o e&s;&s;entially affected the
whole tenour of his hopes, as to make
him again irre&s;olute how to proceed.
He con&s;idered that, although the&s;e were
the fugitives he had pur&s;ued over the
<PB N="219" REF="221">
plains, they might not be the &s;ame who
had been &s;ecreted in the cottage, and it
was therefore po&s;&s;ible that Julia might
have been the per&s;on whom they had
for &s;ome time followed from thence.
This &s;ugge&s;tion awakened his hopes,
which were however quickly de&s;troyed;
for he remembered that the only per|&s;ons
who could have &s;atisfied his doubts,
were now gone beyond the power of
recall. To pur&s;ue Julia, when no tra|ces
of her flight remained, was ab&s;urd;
and he was therefore compelled to re|turn
to the marquis, as ignorant and
more hopele&s;s than he had left him.
With much pain he reached the vil|lage
which his emi&s;&s;aries had di&s;cover|ed,
where fortunately he obtained &s;ome
medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Here he was ob|liged
by indi&s;po&s;ition to re&s;t. The an|gui&s;h
of his mind equalled that of his
body. Tho&s;e impetuous pa&s;&s;ions which
&s;o &s;trongly marked his nature, were
rou&s;ed and exa&s;perated to a degree that
<PB N="220" REF="222">
operated powerfully upon his con&s;titu|tion,
and threatened him with the mo&s;t
alarming con&s;equences. The effect of
his wound was heightened by the agita|tion
of his mind; and a fever, which
quickly a&s;&s;umed a very &s;erious a&s;pect,
co-operated to endanger his life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;tle of Mazzini was &s;till
the &s;cene of di&s;&s;ention and mi&s;ery.
The impatience and a&s;toni&s;hment of the
marquis being daily increa&s;ed by the
lengthened ab&s;ence of the duke, he di&s;|patched
&s;ervants to the fore&s;t of Maren|tino,
to enquire the occa&s;ion of this cir|cum&s;tance.
They returned with intelli|gence,
that neither Julia, the duke, nor
any of his peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> were there. He there|fore
concluded, that his daughter had
fled the cottage upon information of the
approach of the duke, who, he believed,
was &s;till engaged in the pur&s;uit. With
re&s;pect to Ferdinand, who yet pined
in &s;orrow and anxiety in his dungeon,
the rigour of the marquis's conduct
was unabated. He apprehended that
his &s;on, if liberated, would quickly
di&s;cover the retreat of Julia, and by
his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, confirm her
in di&s;obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="224">
Ferdinand in the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olitude
of his dungeon, brooded over the late
calamity in gloomy ineffectual lament|ation.
The idea of Hippolitus&mdash;of
Hippolitus murdered&mdash;aro&s;e to his ima|gination
in bu&s;y in tru&s;ion, and &s;ubdued
the &s;tronge&s;t efforts of his fortitude.
Julia too, his beloved &s;i&s;ter&mdash;unpro|tected&mdash;unfriended&mdash;might,
even at the
moment he lamented her, be &s;inking
under &s;ufferings dreadful to humanity.
The airy &s;chemes he once formed of fu|ture
felicity, re&s;ulting from the union
of two per&s;ons &s;o ju&s;tly dear to him&mdash;with
the gay vi&s;ions of pa&s;t happine&s;s&mdash;floated
upon his fancy, and the lu&s;tre
they reflected, &s;erved only to heighten
by contra&s;t, the ob&s;curity and gloom of
his pre&s;ent views. He had, however, a
new &s;ubject of a&s;toni&s;hment, which often
withdrew his thoughts from their accu&s;tomed
object, and &s;ub&s;tituted a &s;en&s;a|tion
le&s;s painful, though &s;carcely le&s;s
powerful. One night, as he lay rumi|nating
<PB N="223" REF="225">
on the pa&s;t in melancholy de|jection,
the &s;tillne&s;s of the place was
&s;uddenly interrupted by a low and di&s;|mal
&s;ound. It returned at intervals in
hollow &s;ighings, and &s;eemed to come
from &s;ome per&s;on in deep di&s;tre&s;s. So
much did fear operate upon his mind,
that he was uncertain whether it aro&s;e
from within or from without. He
looked round his dungeon, but could
di&s;tingui&s;h no object through the im|penetrable
darkne&s;s. As he li&s;tened in
deep amazement, the &s;ound was re|peated
in moans more hollow. Ter|ror
now occupied his mind, and di&s;|turbed
his rea&s;on; he &s;tarted from his
po&s;ture, and, determined to be &s;atisfied
whether any per&s;on be&s;ide him&s;elf was
in the dungeon, groped, with arms ex|tended,
along the walls. The place was
empty, but coming to a particular &s;pot,
the &s;ound &s;uddenly aro&s;e more di&s;tinctly
to his ear. He called aloud, and a&s;ked
who was there; but received no an&s;wer.
Soon after all was &s;till; and after li&s;tening
<PB N="224" REF="226">
for &s;ome time without hearing the
&s;ounds renewed, he laid him&s;elf down to
&s;leep. On the following day he men|tioned
to the man who brought him
food, what he had heard, and enquired
concerning the noi&s;e. The &s;ervant ap|peared
very much terrified, but could
give no information that might in the
lea&s;t account for the circum&s;tance, till
he mentioned the vicinity of the dun|geon
to the &s;outhern buildings. The
dreadful relation formerly given by
the marquis, in&s;tantly recurred to the
mind of Ferdinand, who did not he&s;i|tate
to believe, that the moans he heard
came from the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of the mur|dered
della Campo. At this conviction,
horror thrilled his nerves; but he re|membered
his oath, and was &s;ilent. His
courage, however, yielded to the idea of
pa&s;&s;ing another night alone in his pri|&s;on,
where, if the vengeful &s;pirit of the
murdered &s;hould appear, he might even
die of the horror which its appearance
would in&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227">
The mind of Ferdinand was highly
&s;uperior to the general influence of &s;u|per&s;tition;
but, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance
&s;uch &s;trong correlative circum&s;tances
appeared as compelled even incredulity
to yield. He had him&s;elf heard &s;trange
and awful &s;ounds in the for&s;aken &s;ou|thern
buildings;&mdash;he received from his
father a dreadful &s;ecret relative to them&mdash;a
&s;ecret in which his honour, nay even
his life, was bound up. His father had
al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed, that he had him&s;elf there
&s;een appearances which he could never af|ter
remember without horror, and which
had occa&s;ioned him to quit that part of
the ca&s;tle. All the&s;e recollections pre&s;ented
to Ferdinand a chain of evidence
too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted, and he could
not doubt that the &s;pirit of the dead
had for once been permitted to revi&s;it
the earth, and to call down vengeance
on the de&s;cendants of the murderer.</P>
<P>This conviction occa&s;ioned him a de|gree
of horror, &s;uch as no apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="226" REF="228">
of mortal powers could have excited,
and he determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre|vail
on Peter to pa&s;s the hours of mid|night
with him in his dungeon. The
&s;trictne&s;s of Peter's fidelity yielded to
the per&s;ua&s;ions of Ferdinand, though
no bribe could tempt him to incur
the re&s;entment of the marquis, by per|mitting
an e&s;cape. Ferdinand pa&s;&s;ed
the day in lingering anxious expecta|tion,
and the return of night brought
Peter to the dungeon. His kindne&s;s
expo&s;ed him to a danger which he had
not fore&s;een; for when &s;eated in the dun|geon,
alone with his pri&s;oner, how ea&s;ily
might that pri&s;oner have conquered
him, and left him to pay his life to the
fury of the marquis. He was pre&s;erved
by the humanity of Ferdinand, who in|&s;tantly
perceived his advantage, but di&s;|dained
to involve an innocent man in
de&s;truction, and &s;purned the &s;ugge&s;tion
from his mind.</P>
<P>Peter, who&s;e friend&s;hip was &s;tronger
<PB N="227" REF="229">
than his courage, trembled with appre|hen&s;ion
as the hour drew nigh in which
the groans had been heard on the pre|ceding
night. He recounted to Ferdi|nand
a variety of terrific circum&s;tances,
which exi&s;ted only in the heated imagi|nations
of his fellow &s;ervants, but which
were &s;till admitted by them as facts.
Among the re&s;t, he did not omit to
mention the light and the figure, which
had been &s;een to i&s;&s;ue from the &s;outh
tower on the night of Julia's intended
elopement; a circum&s;tance which he
embelli&s;hed with innumerable aggra|vations
of fear and wonder. He con|cluded
with de&s;cribing the general con|&s;ternation
it had cau&s;ed, and the con&s;e|quent
behaviour of the marquis, who
laughed at the fears of his people, yet
conde&s;cended to quiet them by a for|mal
review of the buildings, whence
their terror had originated. He related
the adventure of the door, which refu&s;|ed
to yield&mdash;the &s;ounds which aro&s;e
<PB N="228" REF="230">
from within, and the di&s;covery of the
fallen roof; but declared, that neither
he, nor any of his fellow-&s;ervants be|lieved
the noi&s;e, or the ob&s;truction pro|ceeded
from that, "becau&s;e, my lord,"
continued he, "the door &s;eemed to be
held only in one place; and as for the
noi&s;e&mdash;O! Lord! I never &s;hall forget
what a noi&s;e it was it was a thou&s;and
times louder than what any &s;tones could
make."</P>
<P>Ferdinand li&s;tened to this narrative in
&s;ilent wonder!&mdash;wonder, not occa&s;ioned
by the adventure de&s;cribed, but by the
hardihood and ra&s;hne&s;s of the marquis,
who had thus expo&s;ed to the in&s;pection
of his people, that dreadful &s;pot which
he knew from experience to be the haunt
of an injured &s;pirit; a &s;pot which he
had hitherto &s;crupulou&s;ly concealed
from human eye, and human curio&s;ity;
and which, for &s;o many years, he had
not dared even him&s;elf to enter. Peter
went on, but was pre&s;ently interrupted
<PB N="229" REF="231">
by a hollow moan, which &s;eemed to
come from beneath the ground. "Ble&s;|&s;ed
virgin!" exclaimed he: Ferdinand
li&s;tened in awful expectation. A groan
longer and more dreadful was repeated,
when Peter &s;tarting from his &s;eat, and
&s;natching up the lamp, ru&s;hed out of
the dungeon. Ferdinand, who was left
in total darkne&s;s, followed to the door,
which the affrighted Peter had not
&s;topped to fa&s;ten, but which had clo&s;ed,
and &s;eemed held by a lock that could be
opened only on the out&s;ide. The &s;en&s;a|tions
of Ferdinand, thus compelled to
remain in the dungeon, are not to be
imagined. The horrors of the night,
whatever they were to be, he was to en|dure
alone. By degrees, however, he
&s;eemed to acquire the valour of de&s;pair.
The &s;ounds were repeated at intervals
for near an hour, when &s;ilence returned,
and remained undi&s;turbed during the
re&s;t of the night. Ferdinand was alarm|ed
by no appearance; and at length,
<PB N="230" REF="232">
overcome with anxiety and watching,
he &s;unk to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the following morning Peter re|turned
to the dungeon, &s;carcely know|ing
what to expect, yet expecting &s;ome|thing
very &s;trange, perhaps the murder&mdash;perhaps
the &s;upernatural di&s;appear|ance
of his young lord. Full of the&s;e
wild apprehen&s;ions, he dared not ven|ture
thither alone, but per&s;uaded &s;ome of
the &s;ervants, to whom he had commun|icated
his terrors, to accompany him to
the door. As they pa&s;&s;ed along he re|collected,
that in the terror of the pre|ceding
night he had forgot to fa&s;ten the
door, and he now feared that his pri&s;oner
had made his e&s;cape without a miracle.
He hurried to the door, and his &s;urprize
was extreme to find it fa&s;tened. It in|&s;tantly
&s;truck him that this was the
work of a &s;upernatural power; when, on
calling aloud, he was an&s;wered by a
voice from within. His ab&s;urd fear
did not &s;uffer him to recognize the voice
<PB N="231" REF="233">
of Ferdinand, neither did he &s;uppo&s;e
that Ferdinand had failed to e&s;cape;
he, therefore, attributed the voice to
the being he had heard on the preced|ing
night; and &s;tarting back from the
door, fled with his companions to the
great hall. There the uproar occa&s;ion|ed
by their entrance called together a
number of per&s;ons, among&s;t whom was
the marquis, who was &s;oon informed of
the cau&s;e of alarm, with a long hi&s;tory
of the circum&s;tances of the foregoing
night. At this information, the mar|quis
a&s;&s;umed a very &s;tern look, and
&s;everely reprimanded Peter for his im|prudence,
at the &s;ame time reproaching
the other &s;ervants with their undutiful|ne&s;s
in thus di&s;turbing his peace. He
reminded them of the conde&s;cen&s;ion he
had practi&s;ed to di&s;&s;ipate their former
terrors, and of the re&s;ult of their exa|mination.
He then a&s;&s;ured them, that
&s;ince indulgence had only encouraged
intru&s;ion, he would for the future be &s;e|vere;
<PB N="232" REF="234">
vere; and concluded with declaring, that
the fir&s;t man who &s;hould di&s;turb him
with a repetition of &s;uch ridiculous ap|prehen&s;ions,
or &s;hould attempt to di&s;|turb
the peace of the ca&s;tle by circula|ting
the&s;e idle notions, &s;hould be ri|gorou&s;ly
puni&s;hed, and bani&s;hed his do|minions.
They &s;hrunk back at this
reproof, and were &s;ilent. "Bring a
torch," &s;aid the marquis, "and &s;hew
me to the dungeon. I will once more
conde&s;cend to confute you."</P>
<P>They obeyed, and de&s;cended with
the marquis, who, arriving at the dun|geon,
in&s;tantly threw open the door,
and di&s;covered to the a&s;toni&s;hed eyes of
his attendants&mdash;Ferdinand!&mdash;He &s;tart|ed
with &s;urprize at the entrance of his
father thus attended. The marquis
darting upon him a &s;evere look, which
he perfectly comprehended&mdash;"Now,"
cried he, turning to his people, "what
do you &s;ee? My &s;on, whom I my&s;elf
placed here, and who&s;e voice, which
<PB N="233" REF="235">
an&s;wered to your calls, you have tran&s;|formed
into unknown &s;ounds. "Speak,
Ferdinand, and confirm what I &s;ay."
Ferdinand did &s;o. "What dreadful
&s;pectre appeared to you la&s;t night? Re|&s;umed
the marquis, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly
upon him: gratify the&s;e fellows with a
de&s;cription of it, for they cannot exi&s;t
without &s;omething of the marvelous."
"None my lord," replied Ferdinand,
who too well under&s;tood the manner of
the marquis. "Tis well," cried the
marquis, "and this is the la&s;t time,"
turning to his attendants, "that your
folly &s;hall be treated with &s;o much le|nity."
He cea&s;ed to urge the &s;ubject,
and forbore to a&s;k Ferdinand even one
que&s;tion before his &s;ervants, concern|ing
the nocturnal &s;ounds de&s;cribed by
Peter. He quitted the dungeon with
eyes &s;teadily bent in anger and &s;u&s;|picion
upon Ferdinand. The marquis
&s;u&s;pected that the fears of his &s;on had
inadvertently betrayed to Peter a part
of the &s;ecret intru&s;ted to him, and
<PB N="234" REF="236">
he artfully interrogated Peter with
&s;eeming carele&s;sne&s;s, concerning the
circum&s;tances of the preceding night.
From him he drew &s;uch an&s;wers as ho|nourably
acquitted Ferdinand of indi&s;|cretion,
and relieved him&s;elf from tor|menting
apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The following night pa&s;&s;ed quietly
away; neither &s;ound nor appearance di&s;|turbed
the peace of Ferdinand. The
marquis, on the next day, thought pro|per
to &s;often the &s;everity of his &s;uffer|ings,
and he was removed from his dun|geon
to a room &s;trongly grated, but ex|po&s;ed
to the light of day.</P>
<P>Meanwhile a circum&s;tance occurred
which increa&s;ed the general di&s;cord, and
threatened Emilia with the lo&s;s of her
la&s;t remaining comfort&mdash;the advice and
con&s;olation of Madame de Menon. The
marchione&s;s, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for the count
de Vereza had at length yielded to ab|&s;ence,
and the pre&s;&s;ure of pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances,
now be&s;towed her &s;miles
<PB N="235" REF="237">
upon a young Italian cavalier, a vi&s;itor
at the ca&s;tle, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much of
the &s;pirit of gallantry to permit a lady
to langui&s;h in vain. The marquis, who&s;e
mind was occupied with other pa&s;&s;ions,
was in&s;en&s;ible to the mi&s;conduct of his
wife, who at all times had the addre&s;s
to di&s;gui&s;e her vices beneath the glo&s;s
of virtue and innocent freedom. The
intrigue was di&s;covered by Madame,
who, having one day left a book in the
oak parlour, returned thither in &s;earch
of it. As &s;he opened the door of the
apartment, &s;he heard the voice of the ca|valier
in pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation; and on
entering, di&s;covered him ri&s;ing in &s;ome
confu&s;ion from the feet of the marchio|ne&s;s,
who, darting at Madame a look of
&s;everity, aro&s;e from her &s;eat. Madame,
&s;hocked at what &s;he had &s;een, in&s;tantly
retired, and buried in her own bo&s;om
that &s;ecret, the di&s;covery of which
would mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially have poi&s;oned
the peace of the marquis. The mar|chione&s;s,
<PB N="236" REF="238">
who was a &s;tranger to the ge|nero&s;ity
of &s;entiment which actuated
Madame de Menon, doubted not that
&s;he would &s;eize the moment of retalia|tion,
and expo&s;e her conduct where
mo&s;t &s;he dreaded it &s;hould be known.
The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt tortured her
with ince&s;&s;ant fear of di&s;covery, and
from this period her whole attention was
employed to di&s;lodge from the ca&s;tle,
the per&s;on to whom her character was
committed. In this it was not difficult
to &s;ucceed; for the delicacy of Ma|dame's
feelings made her quick to per|ceive,
and to withdraw from a treatment
un&s;uitable to the natural dignity of her
character. She therefore re&s;olved to
depart from the ca&s;tle; but di&s;daining
to take an advantage even over a &s;uc|ce&s;sful
enemy, &s;he determined to be
&s;ilent on that &s;ubject which would in|&s;tantly
have transferred the triumph from
her adver&s;ary to her&s;elf. When the
marquis, on hearing her determination
<PB N="237" REF="239">
to retire, earne&s;tly enquired for the mo|tive
of her conduct, &s;he forbore to ac|quaint
him with the real one, and left
him to incertitude and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>To Emilia this de&s;ign occa&s;ioned a
di&s;tre&s;s which almo&s;t &s;ubdued the re|&s;olution
of Madame. Her tears and in|treaties
&s;poke the artle&s;s energy of &s;or|row.
In Madame &s;he lo&s;t her only
friend; and &s;he too well under&s;tood the
value of that friend, to &s;ee her depart
without feeling and expre&s;&s;ing the deep|e&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s. From a &s;trong attachment
to the memory of the mother, Madame
had been induced to undertake the edu|cation
of her daughters, who&s;e engaging
di&s;po&s;itions had perpetuated a kind of
hereditary affection. Regard for Emi|lia
and Julia had alone for &s;ome time
detained her at the ca&s;tle; but this was
now &s;ucceeded by the influence of con|&s;iderations
too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted.
As her income was &s;mall, it was her
plan to retire to her native place, which
<PB N="238" REF="240">
was &s;ituated in a di&s;tant part of the
i&s;land, and there take up her re&s;idence
in a convent.</P>
<P>Emilia &s;aw the time of Madame's de|parture
approach with increa&s;ed di&s;tre&s;s.
They left each other with a mutual &s;or|row,
which did honour to their hearts.
When her la&s;t friend was gone, Emilia
wandered through the for&s;aken apart|ments,
where &s;he had been accu&s;tomed
to conver&s;e with Julia, and to receive
con&s;olation and &s;ympathy from her
dear in&s;tructre&s;s, with a kind of angui&s;h
known only to tho&s;e who have experienc|ed
a &s;imilar &s;ituation. Madame pur&s;ued
her journey with a heavy heart. Separated
from the objects of her fonde&s;t affecti|ons,
and from the &s;cenes and occupati|ons
for which long habit had formed
claims upon her heart, &s;he &s;eemed with|out
intere&s;t and without motive for ex|ertion.
The world appeared a wide and
gloomy de&s;ert, where no heart welcom|ed
her with kindne&s;s&mdash;no countenance
<PB N="239" REF="241">
brightened into &s;miles at her approach.
It was many years &s;ince &s;he quitted Calini&mdash;and
in the interval, death had &s;wept
away the few friends &s;he left there. The
future pre&s;ented a melancholy &s;cene;
but &s;he had the retro&s;pect of years &s;pent
in honourable endeavour and &s;trict inte|grity,
to cheer her heart and encourage
her hopes.</P>
<P>But her utmo&s;t endeavours were una|ble
to repre&s;s the anxiety with which the
uncertain fate of Julia overwhelmed her.
Wild and terrific images aro&s;e to her
imagination. Fancy drew the &s;cene;&mdash;&s;he
deepened the &s;hades; and the terrific
a&s;pect of the objects &s;he pre&s;ented was
heighted by the ob&s;curity which in|volved
them.</P>
