<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Preface to a Play &s;eems generally to be
con&s;idered as a kind of Clo&s;et-prologue,
in which&mdash;if his Piece has been &s;ucce&s;s|ful&mdash;the
Author &s;olicits that indulgence from
the Reader which he had before experienced
from the Audience: But as the &s;cope and im|mediate
object of a Play is to plea&s;e a mixed
a&s;&s;embly in <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI> (who&s;e judgment
in the Theatre at lea&s;t is deci&s;ive) its degree
of reputation is u&s;ually as determined as pub|lic,
before it can be prepared for the cooler
tribunal of the Study. Thus any farther &s;o|licitude
on the part of the Writer becomes
unnece&s;&s;ary at lea&s;t, if not an intru&s;ion: and
if the Piece has been condemned in the Per|formance,
I fear an Addre&s;s to the Clo&s;et,
like an Appeal to Po&s;terity, is con&s;tantly re|garded
as the procra&s;tination of a &s;uit, from
a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the weakne&s;s of the cau&s;e.
From the&s;e con&s;iderations, the following Co|medy
would certainly have been &s;ubmitted to
the Reader, without any further introduction
than what it had in the Repre&s;entation, but
that its &s;ucce&s;s has probably been founded on
a circum&s;tance which the Author is informed
has not before attended a theatrical trial, and
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
which con&s;equently ought not to pa&s;s unno|ticed.</P>
<P>I need &s;carcely add, that the circum&s;tance
alluded to, was the withdrawing of the Piece,
to remove tho&s;e imperfections in the fir&s;t Re|pre&s;entation
which were too obvious to e&s;cape
reprehen&s;ion, and too numerous to admit of
a ha&s;ty correction. There are few writers, I
believe, who, even in the fulle&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of error, do not wi&s;h to palliate the faults
which they acknowledge; and, however tri|fling
the performance, to &s;econd their confe&s;&s;ion
of its deficiencies, by whatever plea &s;eems lea&s;t
di&s;graceful to their ability. In the pre&s;ent
in&s;tance, it cannot be &s;aid to amount either
to candour or mode&s;ty in me, to acknowledge
an extreme inexperience and want of judg|ment
on matters, in which, without guidance
from practice, or &s;pur from &s;ucce&s;s, a young
man &s;hould &s;carcely boa&s;t of being an adept.
If it be &s;aid, that under &s;uch di&s;advantages no
one &s;hould attempt to write a play&mdash;I mu&s;t
beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from the po&s;ition, while
the fir&s;t point of experience that I have gained
on the &s;ubject is, a knowledge of the can|dour
and judgment with which an impar|tial
Public di&s;tingui&s;hes between the errors
of inexperience and incapacity, and the indul|gence
which it &s;hews even to a di&s;po&s;ition to
remedy the defects of either.</P>
<P>It were unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into any far|ther
extenuation of what was thought excep|tionable
in this Play, but that it has been
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
&s;aid, that the Managers &s;hould have pre|vented
&s;ome of the defects before its appear|ance
to the Public&mdash;and in particular the un|common
length of the piece as repre&s;ented
the fir&s;t night.&mdash;It were an ill return for the
mo&s;t liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their
&s;ide, to &s;uffer any cen&s;ure to re&s;t where none
was de&s;erved. Hurry in writing has long
been exploded as an excu&s;e for an Author;&mdash;
however, in the dramatic line, it may happen,
that both an Author and a Manager may wi&s;h
to fill a cha&s;m in the entertainment of the
Public with a ha&s;tine&s;s not altogether cul|pable.
The &s;ea&s;on was advanced when I fir&s;t
put the play into Mr. Harris's hands:&mdash;it was
at that time at lea&s;t double the length of any
acting comedy.&mdash;I profited by his judgment
and experience in the curtailing of it&mdash;'till, I be|lieve,
his feeling for the vanity of a young Au|thor
got the better of his de&s;ire for correctne&s;s,
and he left many excre&s;cences remaining, be|cau&s;e
he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pruning &s;o many more.
Hence, though I was not uninformed that the
Acts were &s;till too long, I flatter'd my&s;elf that,
after the fir&s;t trial, I might with &s;afer judgment
proceed to remove what &s;hould appear to have
been mo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfactory.&mdash;Many other errors
there were, which might in part have ari&s;en
from my being by no means conver&s;ant with
plays in general, either in reading or at the
theatre.&mdash;Yet I own that, in one re&s;pect, I did
not regret my ignorance: for as my fir&s;t wi&s;h
in attempting a Play, was to avoid every ap|pearance
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
of plagiary, I thought I &s;hould &s;tand
a better chance of effecting this from being in
a walk which I had not frequented, and where
con&s;equently the progre&s;s of invention was
le&s;s likely to be interrupted by &s;tarts of recol|lection:
for on &s;ubjects on which the mind
has been much informed, invention is &s;low of
exerting it&s;elf.&mdash;Faded ideas float in the fancy
like half-forgotten dreams; and the imagina|tion
in its fulle&s;t enjoyments becomes &s;u&s;pi|cious
of its offspring, and doubts whether it
has created or adopted.</P>
<P>With regard to &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages
which on the Fir&s;t Night's Repre&s;entation
&s;eemed generally di&s;liked, I confe&s;s, that if
I felt any emotion of &s;urpri&s;e at the di&s;|approbation,
it was not that they were di&s;|approved
of, but that I had not before per|ceived
that they de&s;erved it. As &s;ome part
of the attack on the Piece was begun too early
to pa&s;s for the &s;entence of <HI>Judgment,</HI> which
is ever tardy in condemning, it has been &s;ug|ge&s;ted
to me, that much of the di&s;approba|tion
mu&s;t have ari&s;en from virulence of Ma|lice,
rather than &s;everity of Critici&s;m: But
as I was more apprehen&s;ive of there being
ju&s;t grounds to excite the latter, than con&s;cious
of having de&s;erved the former, I continue
not to believe that probable, which I am &s;ure
mu&s;t have been unprovoked. However, if it
was &s;o, and I could even mark the quarter
from whence it came, it would be ungenerous
to retort; for no pa&s;&s;ion &s;uffers more than
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
malice from di&s;appointment. For my own
part, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Author of a
Play &s;hould not regard a Fir&s;t Night's Audi|ence,
as a candid and judicious friend attend|ing,
in behalf of the Public, at his la&s;t Re|hear&s;al.
If he can di&s;pen&s;e with flattery, he
is &s;ure at lea&s;t of &s;incerity, and even though
the annotation be rude, he may rely upon the
ju&s;tne&s;s of the comment. Con&s;idered in this
light, that Audience, who&s;e <HI>fiat</HI> is e&s;&s;ential
to the Poet's claim, whether his object be
Fame or Profit, has &s;urely a right to expect
&s;ome deference to its opinion, from principles
of Politene&s;s at lea&s;t, if not from Gratitude.</P>
<P>As for the little puny Critics, who &s;catter
their peevi&s;h &s;trictures in private circles, and
&s;cribble at every Author who has the emi|nence
of being unconnected with them, as
they are u&s;ually &s;pleen-&s;woln from a vain idea
of increa&s;ing their con&s;equence, there will
always be found a petulance and illiberality in
their remarks, which &s;hould place them as far
beneath the notice of a Gentleman, as their
original dulne&s;s had &s;unk them from the
level of the mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sful Author.</P>
<P>It is not without plea&s;ure that I catch at
an opportunity of ju&s;tifying my&s;elf from the
charge of intending any national reflection in
the character of Sir <HI>Lucius O'Trigger.</HI> If any
Gentlemen oppo&s;ed the Piece from that idea,
I thank them &s;incerely for their oppo&s;ition;
and if the condemnation of this Comedy
(however mi&s;conceived the provocation,) could
<PB N="x" REF="8">
have added one &s;park to the decaying flame
of national attachment to the country &s;up|po&s;ed
to be reflected on, I &s;hould have been
happy in its fate; and might with truth have
boa&s;ted, that it had done more real &s;ervice in
its failure, than the &s;ucce&s;sful morality of a
thou&s;and &s;tage-novels will ever effect.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual, I believe, to thank the Per|formers
in a new Play, for the exertion of
their &s;everal abilities. But where (as in this
in&s;tance) their merit has been &s;o &s;triking and
uncontroverted, as to call for the warme&s;t and
true&s;t applau&s;e from a number of judicious
Audiences, the Poet's after-prai&s;e comes like
the feeble acclamation of a child to clo&s;e the
&s;houts of a multitude. The conduct, how|ever,
of the Principals in a Theatre cannot be
&s;o apparent to the Public.&mdash;I think it there|fore
but ju&s;tice to declare, that from this
Theatre (the only one I can &s;peak of from ex|perience,)
tho&s;e Writers who wi&s;h to try the
Dramatic Line, will meet with that candour
and liberal attention, which are generally al|lowed
to be better calculated to lead genius
into excellence, than either the precepts of
judgment, or the guidance of experience.</P>

<P>Ah! Thomas, there lies the my&s;tery o'the

with a lady of a very &s;ingular ta&s;te: a lady who
likes him better as a <HI>half-pay En&s;ign</HI> than if &s;he

our intercour&s;e by a note &s;he intercepted,

<P>Not yet, upon my word&mdash;nor has he the

<P>Well, Julia, you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s,
(though under the protection of Sir Anthony) yet
have you, for this long year, been the &s;lave to the
caprice, the whim, the jealou&s;y of this ungrateful
Faulkland, who will ever delay a&s;&s;uming the right
of a hu&s;band, while you &s;uffer him to be equally
imperious as a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you are wrong entirely.&mdash;We were
contracted before my father's death.&mdash;<HI>That,</HI> and
&s;ome con&s;equent embarra&s;&s;ments, have delay'd what
I know to be my Faulkland's mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h.&mdash;
He is too generous to trifle on &s;uch a point.&mdash;
And for his character, you wrong him there too.&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="23">
No, Lydia, he is too proud, too noble to be jea|lous;
if he is captious, 'tis without di&s;&s;embling;
if fretful, without rudene&s;s.&mdash;Unus'd to the &s;op|pery
of love, he is negligent of the little duties
expected from a lover&mdash;but being unhackney'd in
the pa&s;&s;ion, his love is ardent and &s;incere; and as
it engro&s;&s;es his whole &s;oul, he expects every thought
and emotion of his mi&s;tre&s;s to move in uni&s;on with
his.&mdash;Yet, though his pride calls for this full return
&mdash;his humility makes him undervalue tho&s;e qualities
in him, which &s;hould entitle him to it; and not
feeling why he &s;hould be lov'd to the degree he
wi&s;hes, he &s;till &s;u&s;pects that he is not lov'd enough:
&mdash;This temper, I mu&s;t own, has co&s;t me many un|happy
hours; but I have learn'd to think my&s;elf
his debtor, for tho&s;e imperfections which ari&s;e from
the ardour of his love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I cannot blame you for defending
him.&mdash;But tell me candidly, Julia, had he never
&s;av'd your life, do you think you &s;hould have been
attach'd to him as you are?&mdash;Believe me, the rude
bla&s;t that over&s;et your boat was a pro&s;perous gale
of love to him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gratitude may have &s;trengthened my at|tachment
to Mr. Faulkland, but I lov'd him be|fore

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my way hither, Mrs. Malaprop, I
ob&s;erved your niece's maid coming forth from a
circulating library!&mdash;She had a book in each hand
&mdash;they were half-bound volumes, with marbled

<P>Tho&s;e are vile places, indeed!</P>

<P>Madam, a circulating library in a

blo&s;&s;oms through the year!&mdash;And de|pend
on it, Mrs. Malaprop, that they who are &s;o
fond of handling the leaves, will long for the fruit
at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Sir Anthony, your wife,
Lady Ab&s;olute, was fond of books.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye&mdash;and injury &s;ufficient they were
to her, Madam.&mdash;But were I to chu&s;e another help|mate,
the extent of her erudition &s;hould con&s;i&s;t
in her knowing her &s;imple letters, without their
<PB N="13" REF="27">
mi&s;chievous combinations;&mdash;and the &s;ummit of
her &s;cience be&mdash;her ability to count as far as
twenty.&mdash;The fir&s;t, Mrs. Malaprop, would enable
her to work <HI>A. A.</HI> upon my linen;&mdash;and the latter
would be quite &s;ufficient to prevent her giving me
a &s;hirt, No. 1. and a &s;tock, No. 2.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, fie, Sir Anthony, you &s;urely &s;peak

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mrs. Malaprop, in moderation,
now, what would you have a woman know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ob&s;erve me, Sir Anthony.&mdash;I would
by no means wi&s;h a daughter of mine to be a pro|geny
of learning; I don't think &s;o much learning
becomes a young woman; for in&s;tance&mdash;I would
never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or Al|gebra,
or Simony, or Fluxions, or Paradoxes, or &s;uch
inflammatory branches of learning&mdash;neither would
it be nece&s;&s;ary for her to handle any of your mathe|matical,
a&s;tronomical, diabolical in&s;truments;&mdash;
But, Sir Anthony, I would &s;end her, at nine years
old, to a boarding-&s;chool, in order to learn a little
ingenuity and artifice.&mdash;Then, Sir, &s;he &s;hould
have a &s;upercilious knowledge in accounts;&mdash;and
as &s;he grew up, I would have her in&s;tructed in
geometry, that &s;he might know &s;omething of the
contagious countries;&mdash;but above all, Sir Antho|ny,
&s;he &s;hould be mi&s;tre&s;s of orthodoxy, that &s;he
might not mi&s;-&s;pell, and mi&s;-pronounce words &s;o
&s;hamefully as girls u&s;ually do; and likewi&s;e that
&s;he might reprehend the true meaning of what &s;he
is &s;aying.&mdash;This, Sir Anthony, is what I would
have a woman know;&mdash;and I don't think there is
a &s;uper&s;titious article in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Mrs. Malaprop, I will
di&s;pute the point no further with you; though I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, that you are a truly moderate and po|lite

you have no objection to my propo&s;al.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>None, I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;I am under no

knock'd him down&mdash;and if he grumbled at that&mdash;

<P>Aye, and the propere&s;t way, o' my

her &s;pirits&mdash;her health&mdash;her life.&mdash;My ab&s;ence may
fret her; her anxiety for my return, her fears for

alarmed? If it rains, &s;ome &s;hower may even then
have chilled her delicate frame!&mdash;If the wind be
keen, &s;ome rude bla&s;t may have affected her!
The heat of noon, the dews of the evening, may
endanger the life of her, for whom only I value
mine. O! Jack, when delicate and feeling &s;ouls

been di&s;appointed my&s;elf, it will be very hard if I
have not the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing other people &s;uc|ceed
better&mdash;</P>

<P>You are right, Sir Lucius.&mdash;So, Jack, I
wi&s;h you joy&mdash;Mr. Faulkland the &s;ame.&mdash;Ladies,
&mdash;come now, to &s;hew you I'm neither vex'd nor
angry, Odds Tabors and Pipes! I'll order the fiddles
in half an hour, to the New Rooms&mdash;and I in&s;i&s;t on
you all meeting me there.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad! Sir, I like your &s;pirit; and at
night we &s;ingle lads will drink a health to the
young couples, and a hu&s;band to Mrs. Malaprop.</P>

<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our partners are &s;tolen from us, Jack&mdash;
I hope to be congratulated by each other&mdash;yours
for having checked in time, the errors of an ill|directed
Imagination, which might have betray'd
an innocent heart; and mine, for having, by her
gentlene&s;s and candour, reformed the unhappy
temper of one, who by it made wretched whom
he loved mo&s;t, and tortured the heart he ought to
have ador'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jack, we have both ta&s;ted the Bit|ters,
as well as the Sweets, of Love&mdash;with this dif|ference
only, that <HI>you</HI> always prepared the bitter
cup for your&s;elf, while <HI>I</HI>&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was always obliged to <HI>me</HI> for it, hey!
Mr. Mode&s;ty?&mdash;But come, no more of that&mdash;
our happine&s;s is now as unallay'd as general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let us &s;tudy to pre&s;erve it &s;o: and
while Hope pictures to us a flattering &s;cene of fu|ture
Bli&s;s, let us deny its pencil tho&s;e colours which
are too bright to be la&s;ting.&mdash;When Hearts de&s;erv|ing
Happine&s;s would unite their fortune, Virtue
would crown them with an unfading garland of mo|de&s;t,
hurtle&s;s flowers; but ill-judging Pa&s;&s;ion will
force the gaudier Ro&s;e into the wreath, who&s;e
thorn offends them, when its Leaves are dropt!</P>
