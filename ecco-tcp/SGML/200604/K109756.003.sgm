<P>SOME authors have confounded this bird with the Alpine Crow; but the di&s;tinction is clearly marked. Its bill is longer, more &s;lender, more hooked, and of a red colour; its tail is al&s;o &s;horter, its wings longer, and, as a natural con&s;equence, its flight is more lofty; and la&s;tly, its eyes are environed by a &s;mall red circle.</P>
<P>It is true that the Red-legged Crow re&s;embles the Alpine Crow in the colour and in &s;ome com|mon
<PB N="2" REF="15">
in&s;tincts. In both, the plumage is black with green reflections of blue and purple, which have an admirable effect on that dark ground. Both delight in the &s;ummits of the loftie&s;t mountains, and &s;eldom de&s;cend into the plain. The former, however, is much more diffu&s;ed than the latter.</P>
<P>The Red-legged Crow is of an elegant figure, lively, re&s;tle&s;s, turbulent, but can be tamed to a certain degree. At fir&s;t it is fed with a &s;ort of pa&s;te made with milk, bread, and grain, &amp;c. and afterwards it is reconciled to whatever is &s;erved for our tables.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus &s;aw in Bologna in Italy, a bird of this &s;ort, which had an odd trick of breaking panes of gla&s;s from the out&s;ide, as if to enter the hou&s;e by the window: this in&s;tinct is un|doubtedly the &s;ame with that of the crows, the magpies, and daws, which are attracted by every thing that glitters.

I &s;hall add ano|ther fact of the &s;ame kind, which I owe to a very re&s;pectable ob&s;erver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hebert, trea&s;urer extraordinary of war at Dijon.</NOTE>. It is, that though the&s;e birds be inhabitants of the Alps, of the mountains of Switzerland, and of tho&s;e of Au|vergne, &amp;c. they are never found on the moun|tains of Bugey, nor in all the chain that &s;tretches along the confines of the country of Gex as far as Geneva. Belon, who &s;aw them on Mount Jura in Switzerland, again ob&s;erved them in the i&s;lands of Crete, and always on the &s;ummits of rocks. But Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t affirms that the&s;e birds arrive in Egypt, and &s;pread through the country after the inundation of the Nile has &s;ub&s;ided and the waters are about to return into their bed. If we admit this fact, which however &s;eems to be repugnant to the general nature of the&s;e birds, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that they are drawn to Egypt by the abundance of food with which the lands are replete, after being left by the waters to the powerful influence of a tropical &s;un: and in fact, they feed on in&s;ects, and on &s;eeds which have been lately committed to the &s;oil, and &s;well with milky juice, the effect of incipient vegetation. It follows then, that the&s;e birds do not confine their re&s;idence exclu&s;ively to rocks and the &s;ummits of mountains, &s;ince at

certain &s;ea&s;ons they regularly appear in Lower Egypt. Nor do they &s;eem to be equally at|tached to every bleak eminence; but to be directed in their choice by certain peculiar cir|cum&s;tances, which have hitherto e&s;caped ob|&s;ervers.</P>
<P>It is probable that the <HI>coracias</HI> of Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t.

<P>THIS bird is of the &s;ize of a hen; its plumage is black, with fine green reflections, which are variegated nearly as in the Red-legged Crow: like it, the bill and feet are red; but the bill is &s;till longer and more &s;lender, very proper for in&s;erting into the fi&s;&s;ures of rocks and the cracks in the ground, into the holes of trees and walls, in &s;earch of in&s;ects and worms, which are its principal food. In its &s;tomach are found portions of the mole-crickets. It eats al&s;o the <HI>larvoe</HI> of the May-bug, and is u&s;eful on ac|count of the havock which it makes among the&s;e de&s;tructive in&s;ects.</P>
<P>The feathers on the top of its head are longer than the re&s;t, and form a kind of cre&s;t, which
<PB N="8" REF="21">
hangs backwards; but this only appears after they are full grown, and again di&s;appears when they are aged. Hence the rea&s;on that in &s;ome places they are called <HI>Bald Crows,</HI> and in &s;ome de&s;criptions they are repre&s;ented as having a yellow head marked with red &s;pots. The&s;e co|lours are probably the tints of the &s;kin, which age leaves bare.</P>
<P>The cre&s;t, which has given occa&s;ion to the name of <HI>Mountain-cre&s;ted</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>, is not the only di&s;tinction between this bird and the Red-legged Crow; its neck is longer and more &s;lender, its head &s;maller, its tail &s;horter, &amp;c. Be&s;ides, it is known only as a bird of pa&s;&s;age, while the Red-legged Crow, as we have already &s;een, is migratory, but only in certain countries and in particular circum&s;tances. Ge&s;ner has therefore divided them properly into two &s;pecies; and I have di&s;|tingui&s;hed them by different names.</P>
<P>The Hermit Crows fly very lofty, and gene|rally go in flocks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am aware that Klein makes the Hermit Crow a &s;olitary bird; but this is directly contrary to what Ge&s;ner a&s;&s;erts, the only ori|ginal ob&s;erver, whom Klein copies, without being con&s;cious, when he tran&s;cribes from Albin.</NOTE>. They &s;eek their food often in the meadows and mar&s;hy places, and always ne&s;tle on the tops of old de&s;erted towers, or in the clefts of frightful inacce&s;&s;ible rocks. Sen&s;ible, as it were, that their young are delicate meat,

and much valued by the luxurious, they are care|ful to breed them out of the reach of man. But there are &s;till &s;ome men hardy enough to ri&s;k their lives for the mo&s;t &s;ordid gain, and al|low them&s;elves to be let down by ropes from giddy heights, to plunder the infant brood in their rece&s;&s;es, and reap the mo&s;t dangerous of harve&s;ts.</P>
<P>The females lay generally two or three eggs every hatch; and tho&s;e who wi&s;h to get the brood, commonly leave a young bird in each ne&s;t, in order to invite them to return the fol|lowing year. When the young are plundered, the parents cry, <HI>ka, ka, kae, kae,</HI> but are &s;eldom heard at any other time.

<P>THIS bird has always been famous; but its bad reputation has been owing, mo&s;t probably, to its being confounded with other birds, and loaded with their ill qualities.

Filth and rotten carca&s;es, it is &s;aid, are its chief food; and when it gluts its appetite on live prey, its victims are the weak or u&s;eful animals, lambs, leverets<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus relates a &s;tory of two Ravens concerting an at|tack upon a hare; they picked out its eyes, and devoured it.</NOTE>, &amp;c. yet it &s;ometimes attacks the large

It may happen, too, that the Ravens, by exce&s;&s;ive &s;trokes with their bill, may tear the buffaloes' hides, or even, attracted by the gli&s;tening of the pupil, they may pick out the eyes; but I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that they deliberately determine to eat the buffaloes alive, and are able to accompli&s;h that undertaking.</NOTE>, and then, fixing on the back, it tears off the fle&s;h deliberately: and what renders the ferocity more dete&s;table, it is not incited by the cravings of hunger, but by the appetite for carnage; for it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t on fruits, &s;eeds of all kinds, and indeed may be con&s;idered as on omnivorous animal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> <BIBL>Ari&s;totle <HI>Hi&s;t.

<P>This violence and indi&s;criminating voracity of the Raven has procured it a various treat|ment: &s;ometimes it has been pro&s;cribed as a pernicious, de&s;tructive animal; &s;ometimes it has been afforded the protection of law, as u&s;e|ful in extirpating noxious in&s;ects.

<P>If to the features which we have now traced of the Raven, we join its gloomy plumage; its cry, &s;till more gloomy, though very feeble; its ignoble port, in proportion to its bulk; its &s;avage look; its body &s;melling perpetually of infection<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The authors of the Briti&s;h Zoology alone a&s;&s;ert, that the Raven has an agreeable &s;mell, which is difficult to believe of a bird that feeds on carrion.

<P><Q REND="inline">The young Ravens are hatched very early in the &s;ea&s;on, and again&s;t the month of May are able to quit their ne&s;t.

The young, to the number of four or five, &s;at on the large detached fragments about the middle of the precipice, where they were ea|&s;ily &s;een, and drew notice by their continual wailing. Every time that the parents brought them food, which happened fre|quently during the cour&s;e of the day, they called with a cry, <HI>crau, crau, crau,</HI> very dif|ferent from their other noi&s;e. Sometimes one tried to fly, and, after a &s;light e&s;&s;ay, it returned to &s;ettle upon the rock. Almo&s;t always &s;ome one was left behind, and its wailing then be|came ince&s;&s;ant. After the young had &s;trength &s;ufficient to fly, that is, fifteen days at lea&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="39">
after their leaving the ne&s;t, the parents con|ducted them every morning to the field, and in the evening led them back. It was com|monly five or &s;ix in the afternoon when the family returned, and they &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in noi&s;y brawling. This practice la&s;ted the whole &s;ummer, which would give rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the Ravens have not two hatches annually.</Q></P>
<P>Ge&s;ner fed young Ravens with raw fle&s;h, &s;mall fi&s;hes, and bread &s;oaked in water. They are very fond of cherries, and &s;wallow them greedily, with the &s;tones and &s;talks; they dige&s;t, however, only the pulpy part, and in two hours afterwards vomit up the re&s;t. It is al&s;o &s;aid that they di&s;gorge the bones of tho&s;e animals which they eat entire, like the ke&s;tril, the nocturnal birds of prey, the fi&s;hing birds, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE> Pliny &s;ays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. xxix. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>, that the Raven is &s;ubject every &s;ummer to a periodical di&s;temper, which la&s;ts &s;ixty days, who&s;e principal &s;ymptom is exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t: but I &s;u&s;pect that this is nothing but moulting, which is more tedious in this bird than in many others of the rapacious tribe<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>.</P>

On the approach of &s;torms, it gathers under the &s;helter of crags. The Greenlanders eat its fle&s;h, clothe them&s;elves with its &s;kin, make bru&s;hes of its wings, and &s;plit the quills for fi&s;hing-lines.

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>THIS bird is found in the Molucca i&s;lands, and chiefly at Banda. Our knowledge of it is drawn from an imperfect de&s;cription and a wretched figure; &s;o that we can only con|jecture the European &s;pecies to which it belongs. Bontius, the fir&s;t and I believe the only one who has &s;een it, reckons it a Raven, in which he is followed by Ray, Willoughby, and &s;ome others; but Bri&s;&s;on conceives it to be a Calao. I would rather adhere to the former opinion; and my rea&s;ons are briefly the&s;e:</P>
<P>This bird, according to Bontius, re&s;embles the Raven in the &s;hape of its bill and in its part; though its neck is rather longer, and a &s;light pro|tuberance appears in the figure ri&s;ing on the bill.</P>
<P>This is a certain proof that he knew no other bird to which he could &s;o readily compare it, and yet he was acquainted with the Calao of
<PB N="35" REF="49">
India. He tells us indeed that it feeds upon nutmegs; and Willoughby con&s;iders this feature as different from the character of the Common Ravens; but we have already &s;een that the&s;e eat wild nuts, and are not &s;o much carnivorous as ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the other hand, neither the de&s;cription of Bontius nor his figure di&s;covers the lea&s;t trace of the indenting of the bill, which Bri&s;&s;on re|gards as one of the characters of the Calaos; and the little bump which appears on the bill bears no re&s;emblance to the protuberance which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Calao. La&s;tly, the Calao has neither the &s;peckled temples, nor the black tail quills which are mentioned in the de&s;cription of Bontius; and its bill is &s;o &s;ingularly &s;haped, that an ob&s;erver could not, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, have &s;een it, and not remarked its form, much le&s;s have taken it for the bill of a Common Raven.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Indian Raven of Bontius has a plea&s;ant aromatic flavour, derived from the nutmegs, which con&s;titute its principal food; and it is extremely probable that if our Raven had the &s;ame &s;ort of aliments, it would lo&s;e its rank &s;mell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaean character of Bontius' Indian Raven: <Q REND="inline">Its front bony, plain, and bare before, its belly yellow.</Q> It is often tamed, and employed to catch rats and mice: it is thirty inches long.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It would require to have &s;een the Raven of the De&s;ert <HI>(graab el zahara),</HI> which Dr. Shaw
<PB N="36" REF="50">
mentions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw gives it al&s;o the names <HI>Crow of the de&s;ert, Red-legged Crow,</HI> or <HI>Pyrrhocorax.</HI></NOTE>, to be able to refer it with certainty to its analogous European &s;pecies. All that the Doctor &s;ays is, that it is rather larger than our Raven, and that its bill and feet are red. This la&s;t character has determined Dr. Shaw to reckon it a large Chough; that bird, as we have already &s;een, is indeed known in Africa; but how can we conceive a Chough to be greater than a Raven? I mention this to draw the attention of &s;ome intelligent traveller.</P>
<P>I find in Koempfer two other birds mentioned by the name of Ravens, without a &s;ingle cha|racter to ju&s;tify that appellation. The one is, according to him, of a middle &s;ize, but extreme|ly audacious; it was brought from China to Japan as a pre&s;ent to the emperor. The other, which was al&s;o given to the emperor of Japan, was a bird from Corea, exceedingly rare, and called <HI>Coreigaras</HI>; that is, the Raven of Corea. Koempfer adds, that the Ravens which are common in Europe are not found in Japan, no more than the parrots and &s;ome other birds of India.</P>
<P>[<HI>Note.</HI> We &s;hould here place the Armenian bird, which Tournefort calls the <HI>King of the Ra|vens,</HI> if it were really a Raven, or belonged to that family. But a glance of the miniature figure will convince us that it is more related to the peacocks and phea&s;ants, by its beautiful cre&s;t,
<PB N="37" REF="51">
its rich plumage, its &s;hort wing, and the &s;hape of its bill, though it is &s;omewhat longer, and though other &s;light differences occur in the form of its tail and of its feet. It is properly termed on the figure <HI>Avis Per&s;ica pavoni congener</HI> (Per&s;ian bird akin to the peacock); I &s;hould therefore have mentioned it among the foreign birds analogous to the peacocks and phea&s;ants, if I had been earlier acquainted with it.]</P>

<P>THESE birds &s;pend the &s;ummer in the ex|ten&s;ive fore&s;ts, from which they occa|&s;ionally emerge to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them|&s;elves and their infant brood. Their chief food in the &s;pring is partridges eggs, of which they are very fond, and are &s;o dexterous as to pierce them and carry them on the point of the bill to their young. The con&s;umption is prodigious; and though they are not the mo&s;t &s;anguinary of the rapacious tribe, we may reckon them the mo&s;t de&s;tructive. Fortunately, they are not numerous; we &s;hould hardly find two dozen of pairs in a fore&s;t of five or &s;ix miles compa&s;s in the environs of Paris.</P>
<P>During winter they live with the Rooks and Hooded Crows, and nearly in the &s;ame way. In this &s;ea&s;on, numerous flights of all &s;orts of

<HEAD>N^o. 59 THE CROW.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="39" REF="54"> Crows a&s;&s;emble about our dwellings, keeping
con&s;tantly on the ground, &s;auntering among our flocks and &s;hepherds,
hovering near the tracks of our labourers, and &s;ometimes hopping upon the
backs of hogs and &s;heep, with &s;uch famili|arity, that they might be taken
for tame dome&s;|tic birds. At night they retire into the fore&s;ts to lodge on
the large trees, which they &s;eem to choo&s;e as the general rendezvous,
whither they re&s;ort from every quarter, &s;ometimes from the di&s;tance of
three miles all round, and whence they again &s;ally out in the morning in
que&s;t of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>But this mode of life, which is common to the three &s;pecies of Crows, is not equally &s;uited to them all; for the Hooded Crows and the Car|rion Crows become exce&s;&s;ively fat, while the Rooks continue always lean. But this is not the only difference that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; towards the end of winter, which is the &s;ea&s;on of their amours, the Rooks remove into other climates, while the Carrion Crows, which di&s;appear at the &s;ame time in the plains, make only a partial flitting, and retire into the next large fore&s;ts, where they di&s;&s;olve the general &s;ociety to form new connexions more endearing and more intimate. They form into pairs, and &s;eem to divide their territory into di&s;tricts of about a quarter of a league in diameter, each of which maintains its &s;eparate family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has perhaps given occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that Ravens expel their young from their di&s;trict as &s;oon as the&s;e are able to fly.</NOTE>. It is &s;aid that

this connexion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts inviolate during the re&s;t of their life; and it is even alleged that if one of the couple happen to die the &s;urvivor will never enter into another union.</P>
<P>The female is di&s;tingui&s;hed by her plumage, which is of inferior lu&s;tre. She lays five or &s;ix eggs, and &s;its about three weeks, during which time the male &s;upplies her with food.</P>
<P>I had an opportunity of examining a ne&s;t of a Crow which was brought to me in the be|ginning of July. It was found in an oak eight feet high, in a wood planted on a little hill, where were other oaks larger. The ne&s;t weighed two or three pounds; it was formed on the out&s;ide with &s;mall branches and thorns rudely interwoven, and plai&s;tered with earth and hor&s;e|dung; the in&s;ide was &s;ofter, and lined carefully with fibrous roots. I found in it &s;ix young already hatched, all alive, though they had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours; their eyes were not open<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>Ari&s;totle <HI>de Generatione,</HI> lib. iv. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>, and no plumage was to be &s;een on them except the point of the wing quills; their fle&s;h was a mixture of yellow and black; the tip of the bill and their nails yellow; the edges of the mouth a dirty white, and the re&s;t of the bill and feet reddi&s;h.</P>
<P>When a buzzard or ke&s;tril approaches the ne&s;t, the parents unite to attack them, and dart with &s;uch fury that they often kill them, &s;plitting the &s;kull with their bills. They al&s;o fight with the
<PB N="41" REF="56">
&s;hrikes; but the&s;e, though &s;maller, are &s;o bold as often to prove victorious, drive them from the ne&s;t, and plunder the young.</P>
<P>The ancients a&s;&s;ert, that the Crows as well as the Ravens are watchful of their young after the period of their flight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. vi. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>. This &s;eems to be probable, and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that they do not &s;eparate from their parents the fir&s;t year; for the&s;e birds readily a&s;&s;ociate with &s;trangers, and is it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ociety which is formed in the &s;ame family will continue to &s;ub&s;i&s;t till interrupted by the breeding &s;ea&s;on?</P>
<P>Like the Raven, the Crow can be taught to prattle; it is al&s;o omnivorous: in&s;ects, worms, birds eggs, fi&s;h, grain, fruits, every thing, in &s;hort, is &s;uited to it. It breaks nuts by dropping them from a height<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pliny, lib. x. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>; it vi&s;its &s;nares and gins, and &s;hares the plunder.

Its belly is not &s;o thick or &s;trong, and &s;eems, as it were, ra&s;ped. The&s;e differences, apparently &s;o &s;uperficial, imply more radical di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>The peculiarities of the Rook re&s;ult from its mode of life. It feeds upon grain, roots, and worms; and as in &s;earch of its proper &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, it &s;cratches deep in the ground with its bill, which in time becomes rough, the feathers at the ba&s;e are worn off by the continual rub|bing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daubenton the younger, keeper and demon&s;trator of the cabinet of natural hi&s;tory, made an ob&s;ervation lately in a jaunt to the country, which relates to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.

They went &s;o bri&s;kly to work, that they made the &s;maller &s;tones &s;pring two or three feet. If this &s;ingular exerci&s;e, which no per|&s;on before has attributed to the Crows, be familiar to the Rooks, it will afford another rea&s;on for the wearing and dropping of the feathers that encircle the ba&s;e of their bill. In that ca&s;e the name <HI>turn&s;tone,</HI> now applied to a &s;ingle &s;pecies of bird, might become generic.</NOTE>.
<PB N="47" REF="62">
However, the &s;traggling feathers are perceived there; a &s;ufficient proof that the bird is not naturally bald.</P>
<P>The appetite of the Rook is confined to grain, worms, and in&s;ects; it never prowls in the ken|nel, nor eats any &s;ort of fle&s;h: it has al&s;o the mu&s;cular ventricle and the broad inte&s;tines of the granivorous tribe.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds fly in numerous flocks, which are &s;ometimes &s;o immen&s;e as to darken the air. We may conceive what havock the&s;e hordes of reapers will commit on newly-&s;own fields, or on crops nearly ripe. Accordingly, in &s;ome countries government has interfered<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. The Briti&s;h Zoology vindicates them from the a&s;per|&s;ion, a&s;&s;erting that they do more good than harm, by de&s;troying the caterpillars that gnaw the roots of the u&s;eful plants, and bla&s;t the hone&s;t

labours of the hu&s;bandman. It would require a calculation to decide the point.</P>
<P>But not only the Rooks fly in flocks, they al&s;o ne&s;tle in company, as it were, with tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies; and their &s;ociety is very clamo|rous, e&s;pecially when they have young. Ten or twelve ne&s;ts are &s;ometimes found on the &s;ame tree, and a great number of trees thus furni&s;hed occur in the &s;ame fore&s;t, or rather in the &s;ame di&s;trict<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>. They &s;eek not retirement and &s;oli|tude, but rather prefer &s;ettling near our dwell|ings. Schwenckfeld ob&s;erves, that they commonly prefer the large trees planted round cemeteries; becau&s;e perhaps the&s;e are frequented &s;pots, or afford worms in greater plenty; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that they are attracted by the &s;cent of the dead bodies, &s;ince we have already &s;aid that they will not touch fle&s;h. Fri&s;ch a&s;&s;erts, that if, in the breeding &s;ea&s;on, a per&s;on goes under the tree on which they are thus &s;ettled, he will in|&s;tantly be deluged with their excrements.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance will appear &s;ingular, though very like to what happens every day among animals of a different &s;pecies. When a pair are employed in con&s;tructing their ne&s;t, one mu&s;t be left to guard it, while the other is procuring the &s;uitable materials; without this precaution, it is alleged, the ne&s;t would in an in&s;tant be completely pillaged by the other Rooks which
<PB N="49" REF="64">
are &s;ettled on the &s;ame tree, each carrying off a &s;prig to its own dwelling.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds begin to build their ne&s;t in the month of March, at lea&s;t in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. They lay four or five eggs, &s;maller than tho&s;e of the Raven, but marked with broader &s;pots, e&s;pecially at the large end. It is &s;aid that the male and female &s;it by turns. When the young are hatched, and able to eat, they di&s;gorge their food, which they keep in re&s;erve in their craw, or rather in a &s;ort of bag formed by the dilata|tion of the oe&s;ophagus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willoughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I find in the Briti&s;h Zoology, that after their hatch is over, they leave the trees where they ne&s;tled; and that they return not again till the month of Augu&s;t, and only begin to repair or rebuild their ne&s;ts in October<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid that the herons take advantage of their ab&s;ence to lay and hatch in their ne&s;ts. <BIBL>ALDROVANDUS.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>Like the Rook al&s;o, the Hooded-Crows change their abode twice a-year, and may perhaps be con&s;idered as birds of pa&s;&s;age; for we annually perceive immen&s;e flocks arrive near the middle of autumn, and depart about the beginning of &s;pring, &s;haping their cour&s;e towards the north; but we are uncertain where they &s;top.

Analogies &s;o &s;triking to the Carrion-Crow and the Rook, would lead us to &s;u&s;pect that the Hooded-Crow is only the hybridous offspring of the&s;e two &s;pecies.

<P>THESE birds are nearly related to the Crows; to in&s;titute a compari&s;on between them would therefore throw light on the hi&s;tory of both. As there are three &s;pecies of Crows, the black (the Carrion-Crow), the cinereous (the Hooded-Crow), and the bald (the Rook); &s;o there are three corre&s;ponding ones among the Jack|daws: a black one (the Daw, properly &s;o called); a cinereous (the Chough); and a bald. The only difference is, that the la&s;t is of America, and has little black in its plumage. In general the Jackdaws are &s;maller than the Crows; their cry, at lea&s;t that of the two European &s;pecies, the
<PB N="60" REF="77">
only kinds known to us, is &s;hriller, and has influence in the forming of their names; &s;uch as <HI>Choucas, Graccus, Kaw, Kae,</HI> &amp;c. But it appears that they have more than one inflexion of voice; for I am a&s;&s;ured that they &s;ometimes call out <HI>tian, tian, tian.</HI></P>
<P>They live upon in&s;ects, grain, fruits, and even fle&s;h, though very rarely; but they will not touch filth, nor do they haunt the coa&s;ts to pick up the dead fi&s;h and other carca&s;es that are ca&s;t a&s;hore by the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. In this circum&s;tance they re&s;emble more the Rook, and even the Hooded-Crow, than the Carrion-Crow; but they approach the latter by the habit of &s;earch|ing and hunting for partridge eggs, of which they de&s;troy great numbers.</P>
<P>They fly in large flocks, like the Rooks; like the&s;e, too, they form a &s;ort of cantonments, which are even more numerous, con&s;i&s;ting of a mul|titude of ne&s;ts crouded upon one another, in a large tree, in a belfry, or in the ruins of an old de&s;erted ca&s;tle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon, Aldrovandus, and Willoughby. They prefer the holes of trees to the branches.</NOTE>. The male and female, when once paired, remain a long time &s;teadily united.

After fecundation, the female lays five or &s;ix eggs, marked with a few brown &s;pots on a greeni&s;h ground; and, after the young are hatched, &s;he watches, feeds, and rears them with an affection which the male is eager to &s;hare. In this re&s;pect the Jackdaw re&s;embles the Crows, e&s;pecially the common &s;ort: but Charleton and Schwenckfeld a&s;&s;ert that it has two hatches in the year; which has never been affirmed of any of the Crows, though it well corre&s;ponds to the order of nature, the &s;mall &s;pecies being always the mo&s;t prolific.</P>
<P>The Jackdaws are birds of pa&s;&s;age, though they are not &s;o well entitled to that appellation as the Rooks and Hooded-Crows, &s;ince a num|ber of them continue in the country through the &s;ummer. The towers of Vincennes are at every &s;ea&s;on &s;tocked with them, and &s;o are all old buildings which afford the &s;ame convenience and &s;helter; but in France there are always fewer in &s;ummer than in winter. Tho&s;e which migrate, form them&s;elves into great bodies, like the Rooks and the Hooded-Crows; &s;ometimes they join the &s;ame army, and continually chatter as they fly: yet they keep not the &s;ame periods in France as in Germany; for they leave Ger|many
<PB N="62" REF="79">
in autumn with their young, and appear not again till the &s;pring, after having wintered with us; and Fri&s;ch was right in maintaining that they do not hatch during their ab&s;ence, &s;ince neither the Jackdaws nor other birds breed in winter.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their internal &s;tructure, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that they have a mu&s;cular ventricle, and near its &s;uperior orifice a dilatation of the oe&s;ophagus, which &s;erves in place of a crop, as in the Crows, but that the gall-bladder is more elongated.</P>
<P>They can be ea&s;ily tamed and taught to &s;peak. They &s;eem fond of the dome&s;tic &s;tate; but they are faithle&s;s &s;ervants, concealing the food which they cannot con&s;ume, and &s;ecreting bits of money and jewels.</P>
<P>To complete the hi&s;tory of the Jackdaws, we have only to compare together the two kinds which are natives of Europe, and afterwards &s;ubjoin, as u&s;ual, the foreign &s;pecies and varieties.</P>
<P>THE COMMON JACKDAW<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Choucas,</HI> Buff.</NOTE> is of the &s;ize of a pigeon; its iris is whiti&s;h, it has &s;ome white &s;treaks under its throat, &s;ome dots of the &s;ame colour round its no&s;trils, and &s;ome of an a&s;h colour on the hind part of the head and neck; the re&s;t is entirely black, which is deeper, how|ever,
<PB N="63" REF="80">
on the upper parts, and glo&s;&s;ed &s;ometimes with violet, &s;ometimes with green.</P>
<P>THE CHOUGH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chouc,</HI> BUFF. This is the <HI>Monedula Nigra</HI> of Bri&s;&s;on, which Linnaeus makes to be a variety of the Common Jackdaw, <HI>Corvus Monedula.</HI></NOTE> differs from the preceding, in being rather &s;maller, and perhaps le&s;s com|mon; its iris is blui&s;h, as in the Rooks; the prevailing colour of its plumage is black, with|out any cinereous mixture, and &s;mall white points are ob&s;erved round its eyes. But in every other re&s;pect they are exactly alike, and there is no rea&s;on to doubt that they belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, and would breed together.</P>
<P>We need not be &s;urpri&s;ed that birds &s;o nearly related to the Crows, &s;hould pre&s;ent the &s;ame varieties. Aldrovandus &s;aw in Italy a Jackdaw with a white collar; this is probably the &s;ame with what is found in many parts of Switzer|land, and which for this rea&s;on the Engli&s;h call the <HI>Helvetian Daw</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Monedula-Torquata</HI> of Bri&s;&s;on, which Linnaeus regards as a variety. The <HI>Collared-Jackdaw</HI> of Latham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Schwenckfeld had occa&s;ion to &s;ee a white Daw, with a yellowi&s;h bill. The&s;e white Daws are more common in Norway and the cold countries; in the temperate climates even, as in Poland, a &s;mall white Daw is &s;ometimes found in the ne&s;t of the black Daws or Choughs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rzacynzki.</NOTE>: in this ca&s;e the colour of the plumage does not depend on the

influence of climate, but ari&s;es from a natural defect; in the &s;ame way as white Ravens are bred in France, and white Negroes born in Africa.</P>
<P>Schwenckfeld &s;peaks: 1 &s;t, of a variegated Daw, which re&s;embles the true Jackdaw, except that its wings are white, and its bill hooked. 2. Another Daw, which is very rare, and differs from the common kind in its being cro&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had this year, in my court yard, four tufted hens, of a Flemi&s;h breed, which had the bill cro&s;&s;ed; the upper mandible was very hooked, and at lea&s;t as much &s;o as in the cro&s;s-bill it|&s;elf; the lower was almo&s;t &s;traight.

<P>PLINY calls this bird <HI>Pyrrhocorax,</HI> which name alone includes an abridged de&s;crip|tion. <HI>Korax,</HI> which &s;ignifies Crow, marks the blackne&s;s of its plumage, as well as the analogy of its &s;pecies; and <HI>pyrrhos,</HI> which means rufous or orange, denotes the colour of its bill, which, in fact, varies between yellow and orange; and al&s;o that of its feet, which are &s;till more vari|able, &s;ince they were red in the &s;ubject examined by Ge&s;ner and black in the one de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on. That author mentions al&s;o their being &s;ometimes yellow, and others relate that they are yellow in winter, and red in &s;ummer. The&s;e yellow feet and bill, which la&s;t is &s;maller than that of the Jackdaw, have made it be taken for the Blackbird, and termed the Great Alpine Black|bird. But if we draw a compari&s;on, we &s;hall find that it approaches much nearer to the Jack|daws, by the &s;ize of its body, the length of its
<PB N="66" REF="84">
wings, and even the &s;hape of its bill, though &s;lenderer, and by its no&s;trils being covered with feathers, which are thinner, indeed, than in the Jackdaws.</P>
<P>In the article of the Red-legged Crow, or Corni&s;h Chough, I have &s;tated the difference between the&s;e two birds; which Belon, and &s;ome others who have not &s;een them, have confounded together.</P>
<P>Pliny believed the <HI>Pyrrohocorax</HI> to be of the Alps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Nat.</HI> lib. x. 48.</BIBL></NOTE>; but Ge&s;ner, who has accurately pointed out the di&s;tinction between it and the Red-legged Crow, &s;ays, that in certain parts of the country of the Gri&s;ons, this bird does not ap|pear in winter; and in other parts that it is &s;een nearly the whole year, but that its favourite re|&s;idence, where it &s;ettles in numerous flocks, is the &s;ummit of lofty mountains. The&s;e facts re&s;trict &s;omewhat the opinion of Pliny, but at the &s;ame time they confirm it.</P>
<P>The Alpine Daw is of a middle &s;ize, be|tween the Jackdaw and the Carrion-Crow: its bill is &s;maller, and more arched, than either; its cry is &s;hriller, and more plaintive than the Jack|daw, and by no means agreeable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld &s;ays, that the <HI>Pyrrhocorax,</HI> which he terms al&s;o the <HI>Night-Crow,</HI> is noi&s;y, e&s;pecially during the night, and &s;eldom appears in the day; but I am not certain if Schwenck|feld means the &s;ame bird as I do, by that name.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The prevailing colour of this bird (for we know only its &s;urface) is an a&s;h-grey, deeper in the upper &s;ide, and lighter in the under, and diluting, by degrees, almo&s;t to white under the belly and the parts adjacent.

Its head is covered from the no&s;trils inclu&s;ively, with a &s;ort of black velvet cap, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall &s;traight feathers, &s;hort, interwoven, and very &s;oft to the feel; the&s;e are more &s;traggling under the neck, and much more &s;o under the &s;ides and in the hind part.</P>

It has not a particle of white, and all the colours are dull; the head, the neck, the back, and the brea&s;t, are black, with violet re|flections; the quills of the tail and the great quills of the wings are brown. All the re&s;t is blacki&s;h, with different degrees of inten&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>II. The JAMAICA MAGPIE.</HEAD>
<P>This bird weighs only &s;ix ounces, and is about a third &s;maller than the common Magpie,
<PB N="86" REF="107">
which it re&s;embles in its bill, its feet, and its tail.</P>
<P>The plumage of the male is black, with purple reflections; that of the female is brown, darker on the back and all the upper &s;ide of the body, and lighter under the belly.</P>
<P>They build their ne&s;t on the branches of trees. They are found in every part of the i&s;land, but are mo&s;t numerous at a di&s;tance from the &s;cene of bu&s;tle. After breeding, they quit their con|cealments, and in autumn they &s;pread over the &s;ettlements in &s;uch prodigious multitudes, as &s;ometimes to darken the air. They fly thus in flocks for miles, and wherever they alight, they occa&s;ion con&s;iderable damage to the planters. In winter, their re&s;ource is to crowd to the barn-doors. Such facts would lead us to &s;up|po&s;e that they are frugivorous; but they have a &s;trong &s;mell, and their fle&s;h is rank and coar&s;e, and &s;eldom eaten.</P>
<P>It follows from what I have &s;aid, that this bird differs from our Magpie, not only in its mode of feeding, in its &s;ize, and in its plumage, but is be&s;ides di&s;tingui&s;hed by its being able to continue long on wing, by its a&s;&s;ociating in numerous flocks, and by the rankne&s;s of its fle&s;h. The difference of &s;ex is attended with a &s;till greater in the colours. In &s;hort, if we add that the common Magpie could not tra|ver&s;e the immen&s;e ocean which &s;eparates the two continents, and could not &s;upport the in|ten&s;e

In a word, this bird might be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of &s;tare or jackdaw; but if we except the plu|mage, a jackdaw with a long tail re&s;embles much a Magpie.</P>
<P>It is quite different with re&s;pect to the i&s;ana<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Id.</HI> cap. xxxii.</BIBL> He calls it <HI>Izanatl</HI>; others, <HI>Yxilaolzanatl.</HI></NOTE> of Fernandez, which Bri&s;&s;on confounds with the Jamaica Magpie. The bill, indeed, the feet, and the plumage, have the &s;ame colours in both; but the i&s;ana is larger, and its bill is twice as long: be&s;ides, it prefers the colde&s;t parts of Mexico, and in its in&s;tincts, its habits, and its cry, it re&s;embles the &s;tare.

<P>The male is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the bulk of his head and the lu&s;tre of his colours<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>. The old ones differ al&s;o from the young in their plu|mage, and hence the various incon&s;i&s;tent de|&s;criptions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willoughby &s;ays, that in the Jay de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus, no tran&s;ver&s;e &s;pots appear on the tail.

<P>The Jays are of a petulant di&s;po&s;ition; they have keen &s;en&s;ations and bri&s;k movements, and in their frequent bur&s;ts of rage they hurry into danger, and often entangle their head between two branches, and die thus &s;u&s;pended in the air<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>GESNER.</BIBL> This in&s;tinct makes tho&s;e battles credible, which are &s;aid to be fought between armies of Jays and tho&s;e of Magpies.</NOTE>. When they feel re&s;traint, their violence exceeds bounds; and hence, in a cage, they entirely lo&s;e their beauty, by the continual rumpling, wearing, and breaking of their feathers.</P>
<P>Their ordinary cry is har&s;h and frequent; they are al&s;o fond of imitating other birds who&s;e notes are not more agreeable, &s;uch as the ke&s;tril, the tawny owl, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE> If they perceive in the wood a fox or other ravenous animal, they give
<PB N="96" REF="118">
a certain &s;hrill &s;cream, to alarm their compa|nions; they quickly a&s;&s;emble, pre&s;uming that they &s;hall be formidable by their numbers, or at lea&s;t by their noi&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>. This in&s;tinct, which the Jays have, of &s;ummoning their force, together with their violent antipathy to the brown owl, &s;ugge&s;t &s;everal ways of en&s;naring them, and the &s;port is commonly very &s;ucce&s;sful<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; for they are more petulant than the magpies, and by no means &s;o &s;u&s;picious or crafty; nor is their natural cry &s;o various, though they have great flexibility of throat, and have a turn for imitating all the cries and &s;ounds of animals which they ha|bitually hear, and even human di&s;cour&s;e. The word <HI>Richard</HI> they can the mo&s;t ea&s;ily imitate. The have al&s;o, like the magpie, and all the fa|mily of the daws, crows, and ravens, the habit of burying their &s;uperfluous provi&s;ions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id.</NOTE>, and of &s;tealing whatever they can obtain. But they cannot always recognize the &s;pot where they have buried their trea&s;ure, or, like all mi&s;ers, they are more actuated by the fear of en|croaching on their &s;tock, than by the de&s;ire of u&s;ing it; &s;o that in the &s;ucceeding &s;pring, the acorns and nuts that were concealed, perhaps forgotten, germinate in the earth, and their tender leaves di&s;cover the u&s;ele&s;s heap, though too late, to the frugal &s;ordid hoarders.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="119">
The Jays breed in woods remote from human dwellings, preferring the mo&s;t branchy oaks, who&s;e trunks are entwined with ivy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>: but they are not &s;o artful and cautious as the mag|pies in building their ne&s;ts. I have received many of the&s;e in the month of May; they were hollow hemi&s;pheres, formed with &s;mall inter|woven roots, open above, without any &s;oft lining, and without any exterior defence. I always found them to contain four or five eggs; others &s;ay that the number is five or &s;ix. They were &s;maller than pigeons eggs, gray, with more or le&s;s of a greeni&s;h hue, and with &s;mall &s;pots faintly marked.</P>
<P>The young undergo their moulting in July: they keep company with their parents till the &s;ucceeding &s;pring<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, when they &s;eparate, to form new pairs. By this time the blue plate on their wings, which appears very early, has attained its highe&s;t beauty.</P>
<P>In the dome&s;tic condition, to which they ea&s;ily conform them&s;elves, they become accu&s;|tomed to all &s;orts of food, and live in this way eight or ten years<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olina, Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>. In the &s;tate of freedom, they feed not only on acorns and filberts, but on che&s;nuts, peas, beans, &s;orbs, goo&s;berries, cherries, ra&s;berries, &amp;c. They al&s;o prey on the young of other birds, when they can &s;urpri&s;e them in the ne&s;t during the ab&s;ence of the pa|rents;
<PB N="98" REF="120">
and &s;ometimes they venture to attack the old ones, when they di&s;cover them entangled in &s;nares; and in this ca&s;e they advance with their u&s;ual imprudence, and are often caught them|&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch. <BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their fle&s;h, though not delicate, is eatable, particularly if it be boiled fir&s;t, and af|terwards roa&s;ted.</P>
<P>In Jays, the fir&s;t phalanx of the outer toe is in each foot connected with that of the middle toe; the in&s;ide of the mouth is black; the tongue of the &s;ame colour, forked, thin, membranous, and almo&s;t tran&s;parent; the gall-bladder is ob|long; the &s;tomach not &s;o thick, and lined with weaker mu&s;cles than the gizzard in the grani|vorous tribe. Their gullet mu&s;t be very wide, for they &s;wallow acorns, filberts, and even che&s;nuts entire, like the ring-doves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; I know, however, that they never thus treat the flower-cup of a pink, though they are exceedingly fond of the &s;eed which it contains. I have often admired their procedure: if a pink be thrown to them, they &s;eize it greedily, and if others be offered, they continue to &s;natch them till their bill can hold no more. When they want to eat the&s;e, they lay a&s;ide all the re&s;t but one, hold it with the right foot, and pluck off the petals one by one, keeping a watchful eye all the time, and ca&s;ting a glance on every &s;ide: at la&s;t, when the &s;eed appears, they de|vour

it greedily, and again begin to pluck a &s;econd flower.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Sweden, Scotland, Eng|land, Germany, and Italy; and is, I believe, a native of every country in Europe, and even of the corre&s;ponding climates of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Pliny mentions a kind of Jays or magpies with five toes, which learned to &s;peak better than the re&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. x. 42.</BIBL></NOTE>. This is not more wonderful than that there &s;hould exi&s;t hens with five toes, e&s;pecially as the Jays become more familiar and dome&s;tic than hens; and we know well, that all animals which live with man, and feed richly, are &s;ubject to exuberance of growth.

<P>But another variety, more generally known in this &s;pecies, is the White Jay. It has the blue mark on the wings<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gerini.</NOTE>, but is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common Jay by the almo&s;t univer&s;al whitene&s;s of its plumage, which extends even to its bill and nails, and by the red colour of its eyes, a property ob&s;erved in &s;o many other white animals. But we mu&s;t not imagine that this white complexion is entirely pure; it is often &s;haded with a yellowi&s;h tinge of various inten&s;ity. In a &s;ubject which I examined, the

<P>THIS new kind of Jay has been ju&s;t intro|duced into France. Its red bill is the more remarkable, as the whole of the fore-part of the head, the neck, and even the brea&s;t, is of a fine velvet black.

But to form a clear idea of the colours, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a violet tint &s;pread over them all, except the black, deeper on the wings, fainter on the back, and &s;till more dilute under the belly. The tail is ta|pered, and the wings exceed not one-third of its length, and each of its quills is marked with three colours, viz. a light violet at its origin, black at its middle, and white at its extremity;

The ba&s;e of the bill is &s;urrounded with a fine blue, which appears again behind the eye, and

in the &s;pace below it.

<P>THIS bird is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the jays and magpies by the &s;hape of its bill, which is &s;traighter, blunter, and compo&s;ed of two un|equal pieces. Its in&s;tinct is al&s;o different, for it prefers the re&s;idence of high mountains, and its di&s;po&s;ition is not &s;o much tinctured with cunning and &s;u&s;picion. However, it is clo&s;ely related to the&s;e two &s;pecies of birds; and mo&s;t authors not fettered by their &s;y&s;tems, have ranged it with the jays and magpies, and even with the jackdaws<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, Turner, Klein, Willughby, Linnaeus, Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>, which, it is well known, bear a great analogy to the magpies; but it is
<PB N="110" REF="133">
a&s;&s;erted that it chatters more than any of the&s;e.</P>
<P>Klein di&s;tingui&s;hes two varieties of the Nut|cracker; the one, &s;peckled like the &s;tare, has a &s;trong angular bill, a long forked tongue, as in all the magpies; the other is of inferior &s;ize, and its bill (for he &s;ays nothing of the plumage) is more &s;lender and rounder, compo&s;ed of two unequal mandibles, the upper of which is the longer, and its tongue divided deeply, very &s;hort, and almo&s;t lo&s;t in the throat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Willughby, the tongue &s;eems not capable of reaching farther than the corners of the mouth, while the bill is clo&s;ed; becau&s;e in that &s;ituation the cavity of the palate, which u&s;ually corre&s;ponds to the tongue, is then filled by a protuberant ridge of the lower jaw, which here fits this cavity. He adds, that the bottom of the palate, and the &s;ides of the chaps, are roughened with little points.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>According to the &s;ame author, the&s;e two birds eat hazel-nuts; but the former breaks them, and the latter pierces them: they feed al&s;o on acorns, wild berries, the kernels of pine|tops, which they pluck dextrou&s;ly, and even in&s;ects. And la&s;tly, like the jays, the magpies, and the jackdaws, they conceal what they can|not con&s;ume.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the brilliancy of the plumage, the Nutcracker is remarkable for the triangular white &s;pots which are &s;pread over its whole body, ex|cept the head. The&s;e &s;pots are &s;maller on the
<PB N="111" REF="134">
upper part, and broader on the brea&s;t; their effect is the greater, as they are contra&s;ted with the brown ground.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are mo&s;t attached, as I have ob|&s;erved above, to mountainous &s;ituations. They are common in Auvergne, Savoy, Lorraine, Franche-Compt&eacute;, Switzerland, the Bergama&s;que, in Au&s;tria in the mountains which are covered with fore&s;ts of pines. They al&s;o occur in Sweden, though only in the &s;outhern parts of that country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">It inhabits Smoland, and rarely occurs el&s;ewhere.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI></BIBL>&mdash;Gerini remarks that it is never &s;een in Tu&s;cany.</NOTE>. The people in Germany call them Turkey birds, Italian birds, African birds; which language means no more than that they are foreign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the Nutcrackers are not birds of pa&s;|&s;age, they fly &s;ometimes from the mountains to the plains. Fri&s;ch &s;ays, that flocks of them are often ob&s;erved to accompany other birds into different parts of Germany, e&s;pecially where there are pine fore&s;ts. But in 1754, great flights of them entered France, particularly Bur|gundy, where there are few pines; they were &s;o fatigued on their arrival, that they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be caught by the hand<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A &s;kilful ornithologi&s;t of the town of Sarbourg. (Dr. Lot|tinger, who is well acquainted with the birds of Lorraine, and to whom I am indebted for many facts relating to their in&s;tincts, their habits, and their migrations), informs me, that in the &s;ame year (1754) flights &s;o numerous of Nutcrackers pa&s;&s;ed into Lorraine, that the woods and the fields were filled with them. Their &s;tay la&s;ted the whole month of October, and hunger had &s;o much en|feebled them, that they were knocked down with &s;ticks. The &s;ame ob&s;erver adds, that the&s;e birds appeared again in 1763, but in &s;maller numbers; that their pa&s;&s;age is always in autumn, and that &s;ix or nine years commonly intervene between their vi&s;its. This mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to Lorraine; for in France, e&s;pecially in Bur|gundy, the Nutcrackers appear much &s;eldomer.</NOTE>. One
<PB N="112" REF="135">
was killed in the month of October that &s;ame year at Mo&s;tyn in Flint&s;hire, which was &s;up|po&s;ed to have come from Germany. We may remark, that that year was exceedingly arid and hot, which mu&s;t have dried up mo&s;t of the &s;prings, and have much affected tho&s;e fruits on which the Nutcrackers u&s;ually feed. Be|&s;ides, as on their arrival they &s;eemed to be fa|mi&s;hed, and were caught by all &s;orts of baits, it is probable that they were con&s;trained to abandon their retreats for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>One of the rea&s;ons, it is &s;aid, why the Nut|crackers do not &s;ettle and breed in the inviting climates, is the perpetual war waged again&s;t them by the proprietors of the woods, for the injuries which they commit on the large trees, by piercing the trunks, like the wood-peckers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>. Part of them is &s;oon de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t is forced to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in the de&s;ert unpro|tected fore&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="136">
Nor is this the only circum&s;tance in which they re&s;emble the Woodpeckers; they ne&s;tle, like them, in the holes of trees, which, perhaps, they them&s;elves have formed; for the middle quills of the tail are al&s;o worn near the end<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>, which &s;hews that they, as well as the wood|peckers, clamber upon trees. In &s;hort, Na|ture &s;eems to have placed the Nutcrackers between the Woodpeckers and the Jays; and it is &s;ingular, that Willughby has given them this preci&s;e arrangement in his Ornithology, though his de&s;cription &s;ugge&s;ts no relation be|tween the&s;e &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The iris is of a hazel-colour; the bill, the feet, and the nails black; the no&s;trils round, &s;haded with whiti&s;h feathers, &s;traight, &s;tiff, and projecting; the feathers of the wing and tail are blacki&s;h, without &s;pots, but only terminated for the mo&s;t part with white; though there are &s;ome varieties in the different individuals, and in the different de&s;criptions, which &s;eems to confirm the opinion of Klein with regard to the two races or varieties, which he admits into the &s;pecies of the Nutcrackers.</P>

<P>IF we regard the European Roller as the type of the genus, and re&s;t its di&s;tinctive cha|racter, not upon one or two &s;uperficial qua|lities, but upon the general combination of its properties, we &s;hall be obliged to make con&s;i|derable changes in the enumeration given by Bri&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>On this principle, which appears to be well founded, I reduce, 1. The European Roller and the Shaga-Rag of Barbary, mentioned by Dr. Shaw, to the &s;ame &s;pecies. 2. I range to|gether the Aby&s;&s;inian and the Senegal Roller, with which Bri&s;&s;on &s;eems not to have been ac|quainted. 3. I cla&s;s together the Roller of Mindanao; that of Angola, which Bri&s;&s;on makes his twelfth and thirteenth Rollers; and that of Goa, which Bri&s;&s;on does not mention. 4. I exclude from the genus of Rollers the fifth &s;pecies of Bri&s;&s;on, or the Chine&s;e Roller, be|cau&s;e it is a different bird, and is much more like the Cayenne <HI>Grivert,</HI> with which I &s;hall cla&s;s it: I &s;hall place both of them, under the common name of <HI>Rolle,</HI> before the Rollers, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="116" REF="139">
they appear to form the intermediate &s;hade between the Jays and the Rollers. 5. I transfer the Roller of the Antilles to the Jays, which is the &s;ixth &s;pecies of Bri&s;&s;on. 6. I leave among the birds of prey the <HI>Ytzquauhtli,</HI> of which Bri&s;&s;on has made his &s;eventh &s;pecies of Roller, by the name of <HI>the Roller of New Spain,</HI> the hi&s;tory of which has been given after the Eagles. In fact, according to Fernandez, who is the original au|thor, and even according to Seba, who copies him, it is really a bird of prey, devouring hares and rabbits, and con&s;equently is very different from the Rollers. Fernandez &s;ubjoins, that it is proper for falconry, and that its bulk is equal to that of a ram. 7. I omit al&s;o the <HI>Hoxetot,</HI> or Yellow Roller of Bri&s;&s;on, which I have ranged after the magpies, as being more related to that kind than to any other. La&s;tly, I ex|clude the <HI>Ococolin</HI> of Fernandez, for the rea&s;ons already &s;tated in the article of the quails; nor can I admit the <HI>Ococolin</HI> of Seba, which is very different from that of Fernandez, though it bears the &s;ame name; for it is of the &s;ize of a crow, its bill is thick and &s;hort, its toes and nails very long, its eyes encircled with red <HI>pa|pillae,</HI> &amp;c.

Bri&s;&s;on, who makes two &s;pecies of them, will confirm our conjecture of the identity of the two &s;pecies. They are both nearly of the bulk of the European Roller, have the &s;ame general &s;hape, its bill &s;omewhat hooked, its naked no&s;trils, its &s;hort legs, its long toes, its long wings, and even the colours of its plumage, though dif|ferently di&s;tributed: they are always blue, green, and brown, which are &s;ometimes di&s;|tinct, &s;ometimes mixed, melted together, form|ing many intermediate &s;hades, and having va|rious reflections. The blui&s;h green, or &s;ea green, is however &s;pread on the crown of the head; the brown, more or le&s;s inten&s;e, and more or le&s;s greeni&s;h, covers all the fore-part of the body, with &s;ome tints of violet on the throat; and the blue, the green, and all the &s;hades which ari&s;e from their mixture, appear on the rump, the tail, the wings, and the belly: only the Mindanao Roller has under its brea&s;t a kind of orange tincture, which is not found in that of Angola.</P>
<P>To this opinion it will be objected, perhaps, that the kingdom of Angola is at a great di&s;|tance from Bengal, and &s;till farther from the Philippines. But is it impo&s;&s;ible, or is it not natural, that the&s;e birds &s;hould be &s;pread through the different parts of the &s;ame continent, or the neighbouring i&s;lands, which are connected with it perhaps by the continuation of the &s;ame

<P>The fable, that the Bird of Paradi&s;e conti|nually flies, derived an appearance of probabi|lity from the con&s;ideration of the quantity of feathers with which it is furni&s;hed; for be&s;ides tho&s;e common to other birds, it has many long feathers, which ri&s;e on each &s;ide between the wing and the thigh, and which, extending much beyond the true tail, and mingling with it, form a &s;ort of fal&s;e tail, which many ob|&s;ervers have mi&s;taken.

<P>The&s;e feathers are of the number of forty or fifty on each &s;ide, of unequal lengths; the greater part &s;pread under the true tail, and others lie over it, without concealing it; for their texture is delicately &s;lender, and almo&s;t tran&s;parent, which is very difficult to repre&s;ent in a figure.</P>
<P>The&s;e feathers are highly e&s;teemed in India, and much &s;ought after.

<P><PB N="139" REF="165">
Next to this, the mo&s;t remarkable property of the Bird of Paradi&s;e is tho&s;e two long fila|ments which take their ri&s;e above the true tail, and extend more than a foot beyond the fal&s;e tail, formed by the &s;ubalar feathers. The&s;e, indeed, are real filaments only at their middle; for at their origin and their termination, they are furni&s;hed with webs of the ordinary breadth.

<P>The head is very &s;mall in proportion to the body; the eyes &s;till &s;maller, and placed very near the opening of the bill. Clu&s;ius reckons only ten quills in the tail; but this a&s;&s;ertion was certainly not founded on the examination of a living &s;ubject, and it is doubtful whether the plumage of a bird brought from &s;o great a di&s;tance be entire, e&s;pecially as it is &s;ubject to an annual moulting, which la&s;ts &s;everal months. During that time, which happens

in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, it lives concealed; but, in the beginning of Augu&s;t, after hatching, its feathers are re&s;tored, and in the months of Sep|tember and October, in which calm weather prevails, it flies in flocks, like the Stares in Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Helbigius.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The King Bird of Paradi&s;e re&s;embles much the re&s;t.

<P>The two tufts <HI>(bouquets)</HI> which I regard as the di&s;tinctive character of this bird, appear be|hind the neck and at its origin. The fir&s;t con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal narrow feathers of a yellow co|lour, marked near the point with a &s;mall black &s;pot, and which, in&s;tead of lying flat as or|dinary, &s;tand erect, tho&s;e near the head at right angles, and the &s;ucceeding ones with &s;maller inclinations.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t tuft we perceive a &s;econd, which is larger, but not &s;o much rai&s;ed, and more reclined: it is compo&s;ed of long detached filaments, which &s;prout from very &s;hort &s;hafts, and of which fifteen or twenty join together,
<PB N="147" REF="174">
forming &s;traw-coloured feathers. The&s;e fea|thers &s;eem to be cut &s;quare at the end, and make angles, more or le&s;s acute, with the plane of the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>This &s;econd tuft is bounded on the right and left by common feathers, variegated with brown and orange, and is terminated behind by a reddi&s;h and &s;hining brown &s;pot, of a triangular &s;hape, with the vertex turned towards the tail, and the filaments of the feathers loo&s;e and de|compo&s;ed, as in the &s;econd tuft.</P>
<P>Another characteri&s;tic feature of this bird is the two filaments of the tail, which are about a foot long and a line broad, and of a blue co|lour, changing into a lucid green, and taking their origin above the tail. So far they much re&s;emble the filaments of the preceding &s;pe|cies, but are of a different form, for they do not end in a point, and are furni&s;hed with webs on the middle only of the inner &s;ide.</P>
<P>The middle of the neck and brea&s;t is marked from the throat by a row of very &s;hort fea|thers, di&s;playing a &s;eries of &s;mall tran&s;ver&s;e lines, which are alternately of a fine light green, changing into blue, and of a deep duck|green.</P>
<P>Brown is the prevailing colour on the lower belly, the rump, and the tail; ru&s;ty yellow is that of the quills, the wings, and of their co|verts;
<PB N="148" REF="175">
but the quills have more than one brown &s;pot at their extremity, at lea&s;t this is the ca&s;e in the &s;pecimen pre&s;erved in the Royal Cabinet; for it may be proper to mention that the long quills of the wings, as well as the feet, have been removed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know not whether the individual ob&s;erved by Aldrovandus had the number of wing-quills very complete; but this author &s;ays that the&s;e quills were of a blacki&s;h colour.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This bird is rather larger than the preceding; its bill is &s;imilar, and the feathers of the front extend over the no&s;trils, which they partly cover: this is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character that has been e&s;tabli&s;hed of the&s;e birds by one of our mo&s;t intelligent ornithologi&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The feathers at the ba&s;e of the bill turned back, and leaving the no&s;trils bare. <BIBL>BRISSON.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

They are half a foot long, and reflect backwards. They have no webs but at their extremity for the &s;pace of &s;ix lines, and the&s;e are black and pretty long.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e filaments, this bird has two properties which belong to the Bird of Pa|radi&s;e; luxuriancy of feathers and richne&s;s of colours.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="178">
The luxuriancy of feathers con&s;i&s;ts; 1. In a &s;ort of tuft compo&s;ed of &s;tiff narrow feathers, and which ri&s;es at the ba&s;e of the upper man|dible. 2. In the length of the feathers of the belly and of the abdomen, which is four inches or more; one part of the&s;e feathers, extending directly, conceals the under-&s;ide of the tail, while another part, ri&s;ing obliquely on each &s;ide, co|vers the upper &s;urface of the tail as far as the third of its length, and all of them corre&s;pond to the &s;ubalar feathers of the Bird of Paradi&s;e, and of the Manucode.</P>
<P>With regard to the plumage, the mo&s;t bril|liant colours appear on the neck; behind, it is gold-green and bronze violet; before, topaz-gold reflections, which wanton in all the &s;hades of green, and derive new lu&s;tre from the con|tra&s;t with the darkne&s;s of the contiguous parts; for the head is black, changing into a deep violet, and the re&s;t of the body is brown, in|clining to black, and with reflections of the &s;ame deep violet.</P>
<P>The bill of this bird is nearly the &s;ame as in the Birds of Paradi&s;e; the only difference is, that its upper ridge is angular and &s;harp, while in mo&s;t of the other kinds it is rounded.</P>
<P>Nothing can be &s;aid with re&s;pect to the feet and the wings, becau&s;e they were extirpated in the &s;ubject from which this de&s;cription is drawn; a practice which, as we have re|marked,

<P>Its head is covered with a beautiful blue velvet, changing into green, and exhibiting the reflections of the beryl.

The &s;mall velvet feathers on its forehead project forwards as far as the no&s;trils, which are deeper than in the preceding kinds.

<P>In the &s;ubject on which this de&s;cription is founded, as well as tho&s;e of the three preceding de&s;criptions, a &s;tick was pa&s;&s;ed through their whole length, and projected two or three inches out of the bill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were brought from India by M.

Its plumage has nothing remarkable; in general a grayi&s;h brown prevails on the upper part of the body, and grayi&s;h yellow on the under. The bill is not of an invariable colour; in &s;ome individuals it is entirely brown; in others red at the point, and yellow at the ba&s;e; in all it is nearly of a quadrangular &s;hape, and the points of the two mandibles are reflected in a contrary direction.

But another very remarkable difference, and which is derived from a more intimate cau&s;e is, that the &s;pecies of the Stare is &s;olitary in Europe; whereas the &s;pecies of the Blackbird are extremely numerous.</P>
<P>There is another circum&s;tance al&s;o in which the&s;e birds are analogous; they never change their re&s;idence during the winter.

<PB N="157" REF="187"> &s;eem to be directed by a &s;ort of tactics. It is the
voice of in&s;tinct which ince&s;&s;antly impels the Stares toward the centre
of the battalion, while the rapidity of their motions hurries them beyond it; a
&s;ort of vortex is thus formed, den&s;er at the middle, and rarer near the
verge; and the collective body performs an uniform circular revolution, and at
the &s;ame time con|tinues to make a progre&s;&s;ive advance. This mode of
flying has its advantages and its incon|veniencies. The rapacious tribe is
di&s;concerted by the whirling of the Stares, alarmed by their noi&s;y cries,
and deterred by the appearance of order. But the danger is increa&s;ed of
falling a prey to the arts of man: the bird-catcher fixes a packthread
be&s;meared with bird-lime to each foot, and thus di&s;charges one or two
Stares; the&s;e mingle in the flock of their companions, and in their frequent
gyrations and rencounters entangle others, and a number of victims, after
wa&s;ting their efforts, tumble headlong to the ground.</P>
<P>The evening is the time when the Stares a&s;|&s;emble in the greate&s;t numbers, to provide more effectually again&s;t the dangers of the night; which they commonly &s;pend among the reeds, whither they ha&s;ten about the clo&s;e of the day, in a noi&s;y flight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>OLINA.</BIBL> He compares the noi&s;e of their pa&s;&s;age through the air to the rattling of hail.</NOTE>. They chatter much in the
<PB N="158" REF="188">
evening and morning, at the forming and di&s;|per&s;ing of their forces; are le&s;s clamorous during the re&s;t of the day, and quite &s;ilent during the night.</P>
<P>So attached are the Stares to &s;ociety, that they not only join tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies, but al&s;o birds of a different kind. In the &s;pring, before the breeding &s;ea&s;on, they often a&s;&s;ociate with the crows and jackdaws, and even with the red-wings and field-fares, and &s;ometimes with the pigeons.</P>
<P>Their loves commence about the end of March. Violence decides their choice: they continue as noi&s;y as ever; their twitter is in|ce&s;&s;ant; and to &s;ing and toy &s;eem then their &s;ole occupation. The care of the expected pro|geny &s;ucceeds; but they are not over-anxious in providing for the reception. They often take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ne&s;t of a wood-pecker, which often retaliates in its turn. When they would con&s;truct one for them&s;elves, they only heap a few dry leaves, &s;ome herbage or mo&s;s, in the hole of a tree or of a wall. In this artle&s;s bed the female drops five or &s;ix eggs, of a greeni&s;h a&s;h-colour, and covers them for the &s;pace of eighteen or twenty-one days. Some|times &s;he hatches in dove-cotes, in the roofs of dwelling-hou&s;es, and even in the holes of rocks on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, as in the I&s;le of Wight and

I have &s;ometimes received, in the month of May, ne&s;ts which were pretended to belong to the Stare, and to be found in trees; but as two of them re&s;emble exactly tho&s;e of the Thru&s;h, I &s;u&s;pect that the per&s;ons whom I em|ployed wanted to impo&s;e on me, unle&s;s we &s;up|po&s;e that the Stare had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Thru&s;h, and occupied its place. In &s;ome ca&s;es, however, they make their own ne&s;ts; a &s;kilful ob&s;erver told me, that he has &s;een &s;everal of them on the &s;ame tree.

<P>The feathers of the Stares are in general long and narrow, as Belon de&s;cribes; their colour is at fir&s;t of a blacki&s;h-brown, uniform, and without &s;treaks or reflections.

I always mean the young Stares, which were hatched in the beginning of May.</P>
<P>I have remarked, that in this fir&s;t moulting, the feathers which &s;urround the ba&s;e of the

<P>In the males, the eyes have a larger &s;hare of brown, or it is more uniform<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The female has a little mail in the pupil of the eyes, which in the male is entirely black.</Q> <BIBL>OLINA.</BIBL>&mdash;Willughby &s;eems al&s;o to allude to this &s;lough on the eye: <Q REND="inline">The irides are hazel, the upper part whiter,</Q> where he mu&s;t probably mean the female.</NOTE>; the &s;treaks of the plumage more di&s;tinct and yellower; and the dark colour of the feathers which are not &s;treaked is brightened by more vivid re|flections, that vary between purple and deep green. Be&s;ides, the male is larger, weighing three ounces and a half. Salerne adds, another di&s;tingui&s;hed character of the &s;ex is, that the tongue is pointed in the male, but forked in the female. It would appear that Linnaeus had &s;een it pointed in &s;ome individuals, and forked in others<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Lingua Acut&acirc;.</HI> Sy&s;t. Nat.

<P>They are fond of following oxen and other large cattle as they feed in the meadows, at|tracted, it is &s;aid, by the in&s;ects which flutter round them, or by tho&s;e, perhaps, which &s;warm in their dung, or in meadows in general.

I have rai&s;ed &s;ome of the&s;e birds, and have ob&s;erved, that when bits of raw fle&s;h were offered to
<PB N="162" REF="192">
them, they fixed on the prey with great avidity. If they were pre&s;ented with the flower-cup of a pink, containing &s;eed already formed, they did not gra&s;p it with their claws, and pluck it like the jay, but &s;hook it and &s;truck it again&s;t the bars in the bottom of the cage, till the grains dropped out. I remarked al&s;o, that they drank nearly like the gallinaceous tribe, and took great delight in bathing. It is probable that one of tho&s;e which I rai&s;ed died of cold, in con&s;equence of bathing too often during the winter.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds live &s;even or eight years, or even longer, in the dome&s;tic &s;tate. The wild ones cannot be decoyed by the call, becau&s;e they re|gard not the &s;cream of the owl. But be&s;ides the contrivance of the limed threads and the weel-nets, which I have already mentioned, a method has been fallen on to take entire families, by fix|ing to the walls and the trees where they lodge pots of earthen ware of a convenient form, which the birds often prefer to place their ne&s;ts in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina and Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>.

<P>The &s;hort account which Fernandez has given of this bird is not only incomplete, but care|le&s;sly drawn up; for though he &s;ays that the Tolcana is, in &s;ize and figure, like the Stare, he afterwards adds that it is rather &s;maller. Yet he is the only original author from whom we can obtain information with regard to this bird, and on his evidence Bri&s;&s;on has ranged it among the Stares. It appears to me, however, that the&s;e two authors adopt very different characters of the Stare: Bri&s;&s;on, for in&s;tance, makes it the di&s;tingui&s;hing feature of the genus, that the bill is &s;traight, blunt, and convex; and Fernandez, &s;peaking of a bird of the <HI>Tzanatl</HI> or <HI>Stare</HI> kind, mentions, that it is &s;hort, thick, and rather hooked; and in another place he refers the &s;ame bird named <HI>Cacalotototl</HI> to the genus of the Raven (which is called <HI>Cacalotl</HI> in the Mexican

<P>I here range this bird on the very &s;u&s;picious authority of Fernandez, and the analogy which

its name bears in the Mexican language to that of the Stare; nor am I acquainted with any European bird to which I can refer it.

This white ray is the more remarkable, as it is environed by a deep brown; the dark colours prevail on the upper part of the body, only the wings and their coverts are edged with yellow. The tail is of a full black, forked, and extending not far beyond the wings, which are very long. The under &s;ide of the body, including the throat, is of a fine crim&s;on red, &s;prinkled with black on the &s;ides; the an|terior

<P>THESE birds, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, are nearly related to the European Stares, and often the vulgar and the naturali&s;ts have con|founded them.

<P>Though we have ranged along with the Troupiales, the Ca&s;&s;ies, the Baltimores, and the Bonanas, the&s;e, as they have received &s;eparate names, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by differences that are &s;ufficiently important to form &s;mall &s;ubordinate <HI>genera.</HI> I am able, from the compari&s;on of a number of the&s;e birds, to a&s;&s;ert that the Ca&s;&s;ies have the &s;tronge&s;t bill, next to them the Trou|piales, and then the Bonanas.

The common characters which Bri&s;&s;on a&s;|cribes to them are the naked no&s;trils, and the elongated conical form of the bill.

<P>If we compare the de&s;cription of the Xochitol of Chap. cxxii. to that of Chap. xxviii. we &s;hall meet with contradictions which it will be diffi|cult to reconcile; for is it po&s;&s;ible that the Co&s;|totol, which when &s;o much grown as to be able to &s;ing is only of the &s;ize of a Canary bird, &s;hould afterwards acquire the bulk of a Stare? that when young it has the &s;weet warble of the Goldfinch, but after it is adult, and received the name of the Xochitol, it &s;hould have the di&s;|agreeable chatter of the Magpie?

The Xochitol re&s;embles in two circum&s;tances the Troupiales; it lives upon in&s;ects and &s;eeds, and hangs its ne&s;t from the ends of &s;mall branches.

It is called the Commander<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Spani&s;h, <HI>Commendadoza.</HI></NOTE>, on account of a fine red mark on the anterior part of its wings, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles the badge of the order of knighthood. The effect is here the more &s;triking, as it is thrown upon a ground of &s;hining glo&s;&s;y black; for that is the general colour not only of its plumage, but of its bill, feet, and nails. There are, however, &s;ome &s;light exceptions; the iris is white, and the ba&s;e of the bill is encircled by a narrow ring of red; the
<PB N="189" REF="220">
bill al&s;o inclines &s;ometimes to brown rather than black, according to Albin. But the real colour of the mark on the wings is not a pure red, ac|cording to Fernandez, but is tarni&s;hed with a rufous tint, which increa&s;es and becomes at la&s;t the predominant colour. The&s;e &s;ometimes &s;e|parate, the red occupying the anterior and the more elevated part of the &s;pot; yellow, the po&s;|terior and lower. But is this true with regard to all the individuals, or has not that been a&s;cribed to the whole &s;pecies which is applicable only to the females? We are certain that in the&s;e the &s;pot on the wings is not of &s;o bright a red; be&s;ides that di&s;tinction, the black of their plumage is mixed with gray, and they are &s;maller.</P>
<P>The Red-Wing is nearly of the &s;ize and &s;hape of the Stare; its extreme length is eight or nine inches, and its alar extent thirteen or fourteen; it weighs three ounces and a half.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds inhabit the cold as well as the warm countries: They are found in Virginia, Carolina, Loui&s;iana, Mexico, &amp;c. They are pe|culiar to the New World, though one was killed in the environs of London; but this had doubt|le&s;s e&s;caped from its cage. They can be ea&s;ily tamed, and taught to &s;peak; and they are fond of &s;inging and playing, whether they be con|fined, or allowed to run through the hou&s;e; for they are very familiar and lively.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="221">
The one killed near London was opened; in its &s;tomach were found caterpillars, beetles, and maggots. But in America they feed on wheat, maize, &amp;c. and are very de&s;tructive. They fly in numerous flocks, and, like the Stares of Eu|rope, joining other birds equally de&s;tructive, as the Jamaica Magpies, they pour their fa|mi&s;hed &s;quadrons on the &s;tanding crops and &s;own fields; but the havock which they commit is by far greate&s;t in the warm regions, and near the &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>When the planters fire on the&s;e combined flocks, birds fall of different kinds, and before the piece can be again charged, another flight arrives.</P>
<P>Cate&s;by informs us, that in Carolina and Vir|ginia they always breed among the ru&s;hes; they interweave the points of the&s;e &s;o as to form a &s;ort of roof or &s;hed, under which they build their ne&s;t, and at &s;o proper a height that it can never be reached by the highe&s;t floods. This con&s;truction is very different from that of our fir&s;t Troupiale, and &s;hews a different in&s;tinct, and therefore proves that it is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Fernandez pretends that they ne&s;tle on the trees near the plantations: Has this &s;pecies dif|ferent cu&s;toms accommodated to the different countries where it is found?</P>
<P>The Red-Wings appear in Loui&s;iana in the winter only, but they are then &s;o numerous that three hundred have been &s;ometimes caught in a
<PB N="191" REF="222">
&s;ingle draw of the net. For this purpo&s;e is u&s;ed a long and very narrow net of &s;ilk, in two parts, like that for larks. <Q REND="inline">When they intend to &s;pread it,</Q> &s;ays Le Page Dupratz, <Q REND="inline">they clear a place near the wood, and make a kind of path, which is &s;mooth and beaten, on which they &s;trew a train of rice or other grain, and retire to conceal them&s;elves behind a bu&s;h where the drag-cord is brought. When the flocks of Red-Wings pa&s;s over the &s;pot, they quickly de&s;cry the bait, light, and are caught in an in&s;tant. It is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;patch them, it being impo&s;&s;ible to collect &s;o many alive.</Q></P>
<P>But they are de&s;troyed chiefly as being per|nicious birds, for though they &s;ometimes grow very fat, their fle&s;h is always indifferent eating; another point of re&s;emblance to the Stares of Europe.</P>
<P>I have &s;een at Abb&eacute; Aubri's a variety of this &s;pecies, in which the head and the upper part of the neck was of a light fulvous colour. The re&s;t of its plumage was the &s;ame as u&s;ual. This fir&s;t variety &s;eems to &s;hew that the bird repre|&s;ented in the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es,</HI> No. 343, by the name of <HI>Cayenne Carouge,</HI> is a &s;econd, which differs from the fir&s;t in wanting the red &s;pots on the wings only; for the re&s;t of its plumage is exactly the &s;ame; the &s;ize is nearly alike, and the &s;ame proportions take place; and the dif|ference between the climates is not &s;o great, but
<PB N="192" REF="223">
that we may &s;uppo&s;e a bird could be equally re|conciled to both.</P>
<P>We need only compare No. 402, and Fig. 2, No. 236, of the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es,</HI> to be con|vinced that the bird engraved in the latter un|der the name of <HI>Cayenne Troupiale,</HI> is only a &s;econd variety of the &s;pecies of No. 402, under the name of <HI>Red-winged Troupiales of Loui&s;iana,</HI> which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent article. It is nearly the &s;ame in &s;ize, &s;hape, and in the kind and di&s;tribution of the colours; except that in No. 236, the red tinges not only the an|terior part of the wings, but is &s;pread over the throat, the origin of the neck, a portion of the belly, and even the iris.</P>
<P>If we next compare this bird, No. 236, with the one repre&s;ented, No. 536, under the name of <HI>Guiana Troupiale,</HI> we &s;hall perceive that the latter is a variety of the former, ari&s;ing from the difference of age or &s;ex. All the colours are fainter; the red feathers are edged with white, and the black or blacki&s;h with light gray; &s;o that the figure of each feather is di&s;tinctly marked, and the bird looks as if it were covered with &s;cales. But the di&s;tribution of the colours is the &s;ame, the bulk the &s;ame, the climate the &s;ame, &amp;c.

<P>The two birds figured No. 375 and 376, <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> were brought by the captain of a &s;hip who had collected forty birds from dif|ferent countries, Senegal, Madaga&s;car, &amp;c. and who had called them Senegal Chaffinches. They have been termed Senegal Troupiales; but that appellation &s;eems very improper; for the cli|mate is different from that of the Troupiales, and the Weaver is widely di&s;tingui&s;hed by the proportions of its bill, tail, and wings, and the manner in which it builds its ne&s;t. It is perhaps the African repre&s;entative of the Ame|rican &s;pecies. The two which we have men|tioned belonged to a lady of high rank, who al|lowed
<PB N="200" REF="231">
them to be de&s;igned at her hou&s;e, and has obligingly communicated &s;ome particulars that occurred with regard to the way in which they conducted them&s;elves. This is the only &s;ource of information which we have.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t had a kind of cowl which appear|ed of a brown-gold glo&s;s in the &s;un; this cowl di&s;appeared in the moulting during the au|tumn, leaving the head of a yellow colour; but it again returned in the &s;pring, and was con|&s;tantly renewed the &s;ucceeding years. The chief colour of the re&s;t of the body was yellow, more or le&s;s inclined to orange; this was the predominant colour on the back, and on the lower part of the body; it bordered the coverts of the wings, their quills, and tho&s;e of the tail, which were all of a blacki&s;h ground.</P>
<P>The young one had no cowl till the end of the &s;econd year, and did not even change its colours before that time; which occa&s;ioned its being mi&s;taken for a female, and de&s;igned as &s;uch, No. 376. This mi&s;take was excu&s;able, &s;ince the di&s;tinction of &s;exes is not apparent during infancy, and one of the principal cha|racters of the females is that of pre&s;erving long the marks of youth.</P>
<P>Before the change which took place in the colours of its plumage, the yellow was of a lighter tint than in the old one; it &s;pread over the throat, the neck, the brea&s;t, and bordered, as in the other, all the quills of the tail and of
<PB N="201" REF="232">
the wings. The back was of an olive-brown, which extended beyond the neck as far as the head. In both the iris was orange, the bill of a horn colour, thicker and &s;horter than in the Troupiale, and the legs reddi&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e two birds lived in the &s;ame cage, and at fir&s;t upon good terms with each other; the young one &s;at generally on the highe&s;t bar, holding its bill clo&s;e to the other, which it an|&s;wered, by clapping its wings, and with a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive air.</P>
<P>They were ob&s;erved in the &s;pring to inter-weave chickweed in the grating of their cage; this was therefore conceived as an indication of their de&s;ire to ne&s;tle. They were &s;upplied with &s;mall ru&s;hes, and they built a ne&s;t &s;o capacious as to conceal one of them entirely. The fol|lowing year they renewed their labour; but the young one being new clothed in the plum|age of its &s;ex, was driven off by the other, and obliged to conduct its work alone in another corner of the cage. But it was &s;till per&s;ecuted, and notwith&s;tanding its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour, it was often &s;o roughly treated as to be left in|&s;en&s;ible. They were &s;eparated, and each was intent on building; but the labours of one day were often de&s;troyed in the &s;ucceeding&mdash;A ne&s;t is not the production of an individual.</P>
<P>They had both a &s;ingular kind of &s;ong, &s;ome|what &s;hrill, but very &s;prightly. The old one died &s;uddenly, and the young one was cut off

But I leave the matter undecided, placing it between the Trou|piales and Baltimores, and applying the vulgar name which it receives in St. Domingo, on ac|count of its &s;hrill notes.</P>
<P>This bird is in general brown above, except the rump and the &s;mall coverts of the wings, which are of a greeni&s;h yellow, as al&s;o in the whole under-part of the body; but this colour is du&s;ky below the throat, and variegated with ru&s;ty on the neck and brea&s;t; the great coverts and the quills of the wings, as well as the twelve of the tail, are edged with yellow. But to form

an accurate idea of the plumage of the Whi&s;tler, we mu&s;t imagine an olive tint of various in|ten&s;ity &s;pread over all the colours without ex|ception. To characterize the predominant co|lour of the plumage of this bird, therefore, we ought to take olive and not green, as Bri&s;&s;on has done.</P>

<PB N="204" REF="235">
inches long, &s;tretching more than a half beyond the wings when clo&s;ed. A &s;ort of cowl of a fine black covers the head, and de&s;cends before upon the throat, and behind as far as the &s;houl|ders: the great coverts and the quills of the wings are al&s;o black, like tho&s;e of the tail; but the former are edged with white, and the latter tipped with orange, which is the broader the farther they are from the mid-ones, in which it is wanting. The re&s;t of the plumage is of a beautiful orange; and la&s;tly, the bill and legs are of a lead colour.</P>
<P>In the female, which I examined in the Royal Cabinet, all the fore-part was of a fine black, as in the male, the tail of the &s;ame co|lour, the great coverts and the wing-quills black|i&s;h, the whole without any mixture of other colour; and what was &s;o beautiful an orange in the male, was only a dirty red in the female.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that the bill of the Balti|mores was not only proportionably &s;horter and &s;traighter than in the Carouges, the Troupiales, and the Ca&s;&s;iques, but of a peculiar &s;hape: It is a pyramid of five &s;ides, two belonging to the upper mandible, and three to the lower.

<P>This bird was no doubt &s;o called becau&s;e the colours of its plumage are not &s;o lively as in the Baltimore, and for this rea&s;on it may be con|&s;idered as a degraded race. In fact, when we compare the&s;e birds, and find an exact corre|&s;pondence in every thing, except in the colours, and not even in the di&s;tribution of the&s;e, but only in the different tints which they a&s;&s;ume;
<PB N="206" REF="237">
we cannot he&s;itate to infer that the Ba&s;tard Bal|timore is a variety of a more generous race, de|generated by the influence of climate, or &s;ome other accidental cau&s;e. The black on the head is &s;omewhat mottled, that of the throat pure; that part of the hood which falls behind is of an olive gray, which becomes darker as it ap|proaches the back. Whatever in the preceding was bright orange, is in the pre&s;ent yellow, bor|dering on orange, and more vivid on the brea&s;t and the coverts of the tail than on any other place. The wings are brown, but their great coverts and their quills are of a dirty white. Of the twelve tail quills, the two central ones are blacki&s;h near their middle, olive at their origin, and yellow at their extremity; the next one on either &s;ide &s;hews the two fir&s;t colours mixed con|fu&s;edly; and in the four following quills, the two la&s;t colours are melted together. In a word, the true Baltimore bears the &s;ame relation to the ba&s;tard one in re&s;pect to the colours of the plum|age, that the latter bears to its female; in which the upper-part of the body is of a du&s;ky white, and the under of a yellowi&s;h white. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Oriolus Spurius:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is black, fulvous below, with a white &s;tripe on the wings.</Q> In the State of New-York it u&s;ually arrives in May; attaches its ne&s;t to an apple-tree, and lays five eggs.</NOTE></P>

<P>When we compare the Ca&s;&s;iques with the Troupiales, the Carouges, and the Baltimores, all which have many common properties, we perceive that they are larger, that their bill is &s;tronger, and their legs proportionably &s;horter; not to mention the difference in the general ap|pearance which it would be difficult to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Several authors have given figures and de|&s;criptions of the Yellow Ca&s;&s;ique under dif|ferent names, and &s;carcely two of the&s;e exactly corre&s;pond.&mdash;But before we proceed to con&s;ider the varieties in detail, it will be proper to &s;epa|rate a bird, the characters of which &s;eem to be widely di&s;tant from tho&s;e of the Yellow Ca&s;&s;ique of Brazil: It is the Per&s;ian Magpie of Aldro|vandus. That naturali&s;t de&s;cribes it merely from a drawing, which had been &s;ent from Ve|nice. He reckons it to be of the &s;ize of our Magpie. Its predominant colour is not black,
<PB N="208" REF="239">
but only du&s;ki&s;h <HI>(&s;ubfu&s;cum):</HI> Its bill is very thick, &s;omewhat &s;hort <HI>(breviu&s;culum)</HI> and whit|i&s;h; its eyes white, and its nails &s;mall; whereas the Yapou is &s;carcely larger than a Blackbird, and the dark part of its plumage is jet black; its bill is pretty long, of the colour of &s;ulphur; its iris is like &s;apphire, and its nails of con&s;ider|able &s;trength, according to Edwards, and even very &s;trong and hooked, according to Belon. We cannot doubt that birds &s;o di&s;tinct belong to different &s;pecies; e&s;pecially if Aldrovandus's in|formation be true, that his bird is a native of Per&s;ia, for we are certain that the Yapou is American.</P>
<P>The principal colours of the Yapou are con|&s;tantly black and yellow, but the di&s;tribution is not uniformly the &s;ame, and varies in different individuals.&mdash;The one, for in&s;tance, which we have cau&s;ed to be de&s;igned is entirely black, ex|cept the bill and the iris, as we have &s;aid, and the great coverts of the wings neare&s;t the body, which are yellow, as al&s;o all the hind-part of the body, both above and below, from the thighs inclu&s;ively as far as the middle of the tail, and even beyond it.&mdash;In another, which was brought from Cayenne and lodged in the Royal Cabinet, and which is larger than the preceding, there is le&s;s yellow on the wings, and none at all on the lower part of the thigh, and the legs appear pro|portionably &s;tronger:&mdash;it is probably a male.&mdash;In the Black and White Pye of Edwards, which
<PB N="209" REF="240">
is evidently the &s;ame bird with ours, there is on four or five of the yellow coverts of the wings a black &s;pot near their extremity; and be&s;ides this, the black has purple reflexions, and the bird is rather larger.&mdash;In the Yapou or Jupujuba of Marcgrave, the tail is mottled with black and white only below, for its upper &s;urface is en|tirely black, except the outmo&s;t feather on each &s;ide, which is yellow half its length.</P>
<P>It follows, therefore, that the colours of the plumage are by no means fixed and invariable in this &s;pecies, which inclines me to believe with Marcgrave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;aw &s;ome entirely black, having the back of a blood colour. <BIBL>MARCGRAVE.</BIBL></NOTE>, that the bird which Bri&s;&s;on calls <HI>the Red Ca&s;&s;ique,</HI> is only a variety of the &s;ame.&mdash;I &s;hall afterwards &s;tate my rea&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Oriolus Per&s;icus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is black, the hind-part of its back, and a &s;pot on the coverts of the wings, and at the ba&s;e of the coverts, yellow.</Q></NOTE>.</P>

It is true, that the lower part of the back is red, in&s;tead of yellow, and the under &s;urface of the body and of the tail entirely black; but this cannot be con&s;idered as a material di&s;tinction in a bird who&s;e plumage, we have already ob&s;erved, is &s;ubject to con&s;iderable variations.

<P>In general the Bonanas are &s;maller, and have a &s;lenderer bill in proportion than the Troupi|ales. The &s;ubject of this article has its plumage painted with three colours, applied in large bo|dies.&mdash;The&s;e are, 1. Reddi&s;h-brown, which is &s;pread over all the fore-part of the bird, on the head, the neck, and the brea&s;t. 2. A velvet black on the back, the feathers of the tail, tho&s;e of the wings, and their great coverts, and even on the bill and the legs. 3. Deep orange on the &s;mall coverts of the wings, the rump, and the coverts of the tail. All the&s;e colours are more ob&s;cure in the female.</P>
<P>The length of the Bonana is &s;even inches, that of its bill &s;ix lines, that of its tail above three inches; its wings when &s;pread mea&s;ure eleven inches, and when clo&s;ed extend to the middle of the tail, or beyond it. This bird was brought from Martinico; that of Cayenne
<PB N="215" REF="246">
(Fig. 1. No. 607, <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI>) is &s;maller, and the &s;ort of cowl which covers its head, neck, &amp;c. is black, &s;prinkled with &s;ome &s;mall white &s;pots on the &s;ides of the neck, and little reddi&s;h &s;treaks on the back; and la&s;tly, the great coverts and the middle feathers of the wings are edged with white. But the&s;e differences are, I conceive, too incon&s;iderable to prevent our &s;uppo&s;ing the Cayenne Bonana a variety of that of Martinico. They con&s;truct a curious kind of ne&s;t, re&s;em|bling the quarter of a hollow globe; and few it under the leaf of a Bonana, which &s;helters the ne&s;t, and forms a part of it; the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of the fibres of the leaves.</P>
<P>In what has been &s;aid, it would be difficult to recogni&s;e the Spani&s;h Nightingale of Sloane<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called al&s;o the <HI>Watchy Picket</HI> and <HI>American Hang-ne&s;t.</HI> It is the <HI>Oriolus Nidipendulus</HI> of Gmelin, and the <HI>Hang-ne&s;t Oriole</HI> of Latham.</NOTE>; for that bird is in every re&s;pect &s;maller than the Bonana, being only &s;ix Engli&s;h inches in length, and nine acro&s;s the wings; its plumage is dif|ferent, and it con&s;tructs its ne&s;t in another mode. It is a &s;ort of bag, &s;u&s;pended from the extremity of &s;mall branches by a thread which they &s;pin out of a &s;ub&s;tance that they extract from a pa|ra&s;ite plant, called <HI>old man's beard,</HI> which many have mi&s;taken for hor&s;e-hair. In Sloane's bird the ba&s;e of the bill was whiti&s;h, and encircled by a black ring; the crown of the head, the neck, the back, and the tail, were of a light
<PB N="216" REF="247">
brown, or rather reddi&s;h gray; the wings of a deeper brown, variegated with &s;ome white fea|thers, the lower part of the tail marked in its middle with a black line; the &s;ides of the neck, the brea&s;t, and the belly, of the colour of a dead leaf.</P>
<P>Sloane mentions a variety, either from age or &s;ex, which differs from the preceding, only be|cau&s;e its back has more of the yellow tint, the brea&s;t and belly of a brighter yellow, and there is a greater &s;hare of black under the bill.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds haunt the woods, and have an agreeable &s;ong. They feed on in&s;ects and worms, for fragments of the&s;e are found in their gizzard or &s;tomach, which is not mu&s;cular. Their liver is divided into a great number of lobes, and of a blacki&s;h colour.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a variety of the St. Domingo Ca|rouges, or the Yellow Bottoms of Cayenne, which I proceed to con&s;ider: it re&s;embled much the female Bonana of Martinico, except that its head and neck were blacker. This confirms my idea, that mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;pecies are related, and that notwith&s;tanding our con&s;tant endeavour to reduce their number, we have &s;till carried the &s;ubdivi&s;ions too far; e&s;pecially with regard to foreign birds, with which we are &s;o imperfectly acquainted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Oriolus Bonana:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is fulvous, its head and brea&s;t che&s;nut, its back and the quills of its wings and tail, black.</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<P>This bird is repre&s;ented <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> No. 607, Fig. 2, under the name of the Carouge (Bonana) of the Cape of Good Hope. I had long &s;u&s;|pected that this bird, though brought from the Cape to Europe, was really not a native of Afri|ca; and the point is decided by the late arrival (October 1773) of a Bonana from Loui&s;iana, which is evidently of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and dif|fers in nothing but in the colour of the throat, which in the latter is black, and orange in the former. I am convinced that we ought to en|tertain the &s;ame opinion of all the pretended Bonanas and Troupiales of the ancient conti|nent; and that we &s;hall di&s;cover &s;ooner or later that they are either of a different &s;pecies, or have derived their origin from America.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="252">
The Olive Bonana of Loui&s;iana has much of the olive tinge in its plumage, e&s;pecially on the upper part of the body; but this colour is not uniform; it is tinctured with gray on the crown of the head, and with brown behind the neck, on the back, the &s;houlders, the wings, and the tail; with a light-brown on the rump and the origin of the tail; and with yellow on the flanks and the thighs, and the large coverts and quills of the wings, who&s;e fundamental colour is brown, are edged with yellow. All the un|der-part of the body is yellow, except the throat, which is orange; the bill and the legs are of a cinereous brown.</P>
<P>This bird is nearly of the &s;ize of a hou&s;e &s;parrow; its length &s;ix or &s;even inches, its alar extent ten or eleven inches. The bill is near an inch long, and the tail more than two; it is &s;quare, and con&s;i&s;ts of twelve quills. The fir&s;t quill is the &s;horte&s;t of the wing, and the third and fourth the longe&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Olive Oriole:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is of a du&s;ky olive, below yellow.</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<P>This new &s;pecies, brought very lately from China, appears to re&s;emble &s;o much the Bonana on the one hand, and the Blackbird on the other, that it may be regarded as the intermediate &s;hade.

<P>The Kink is &s;maller than our Blackbird: its head, its neck, origin of its back, and its brea&s;t, are of a&s;h-gray, and this colour acquires a deeper hue as it approaches the back; the re&s;t of the body, both above and below, is white, as al&s;o the coverts of the wings, who&s;e quills are of a poli&s;hed &s;teel-colour, gli&s;tening with reflexions that play between greeni&s;h and violet. The tail is &s;hort, tapered, and parted by this &s;ame &s;teel colour and white; &s;o that on the two mid|quills, the white is only a &s;mall &s;pot at their ex|tremity; this white &s;pot extends higher on the following quills, the farther they remove from the middle, and the &s;teel colour retiring, is at la&s;t reduced on the two exterior quills to a &s;mall &s;pot near their origin.</P>

<P>IT has been &s;aid, that the young of this bird are excluded by degrees, and in detached parts, and that the fir&s;t object of the parents is to col|lect and combine the &s;cattered limbs, and, by virtue of a certain herb, to form them into an animated whole. The difficulty of this marvel|lous re-union hardly exceeds, perhaps, that of properly &s;eparating the ancient names which the moderns have confu&s;edly applied to this &s;pecies,
<PB N="224" REF="256">
retaining tho&s;e which really belong to it, and referring the others to tho&s;e kinds which the ancients intended them to denote. I &s;hall here ob&s;erve only that, though this bird is di&s;per&s;ed through a wide extent, there are certain coun|tries which it &s;eems to avoid. It is not found in Sweden, in England, in the Bugey mountains, nor in the heights of Nantua, though it appears in Switzerland regularly twice a year. Belon &s;ays that he never &s;aw it in Greece; and how can we &s;uppo&s;e that Ari&s;totle knew this bird, with|out being acquainted with the &s;ingular con|&s;truction of its ne&s;t, or if he knew it, that he &s;hould have omitted to take notice of it?</P>
<P>Pliny &s;peaks of the <HI>Chlorion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t.

<P><PB N="225" REF="257">
The Loriot is a roving bird, continually changing its abode; it lives with us only dur|ing the &s;ea&s;on of love. It obeys the primary impul&s;es with ardour and fidelity. The union is formed on the arrival, about the middle of the &s;pring. The pair build their ne&s;t on lofty trees, but often at no con&s;iderable height; they form it with &s;ingular indu&s;try, and in a way very different from that of the Blackbird, though they have been referred to the &s;ame genus. They commonly fa&s;ten to the fork of a &s;mall branch long &s;traws or hemp-&s;talks; &s;ome of which, extending directly acro&s;s, form the margin of the ne&s;t; others penetrate through its texture; while others, bending under it, give &s;olidity to the &s;tructure. The ne&s;t is thus pro|vided with an exterior cover, and the inner bed, prepared for receiving the eggs, is a matting of the &s;mall &s;tems of dog-gra&s;s, the beards of which are &s;o much concealed that the ne&s;t has often been &s;uppo&s;ed to be lined with the roots of plants. The inter&s;tices between the outer and inner ca&s;e are filled with mo&s;s, lichens, and other &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances, which compact the whole. Af|ter the ne&s;t is con&s;tructed, the female drops in it four or five eggs, the ground colour of which is a dirty white, and &s;prinkled with &s;mall di&s;|tinct
<PB N="226" REF="258">
&s;pots of a brown, approaching to black, mo&s;t numerous on the &s;mall end. She &s;its clo&s;ely three weeks, and not only retains long her af|fection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BELON.</NOTE> to her young, but defends them again&s;t their enemies, and even again&s;t man, with more intrepidity than could be expected from &s;o &s;mall a bird. The parents have been &s;een to dart re|&s;olutely upon the plunderers of their brood; and what is &s;till more remarkable, a mother, taken with her ne&s;t, continued to hatch in the cage, and expired on her eggs.</P>
<P>After the young are reared, the family pre|pares for its journey. This commonly happens in the end of Augu&s;t, or the beginning of Sep|tember. They never a&s;&s;emble in numerous flocks, nor do the families remain united, for &s;eldom are more than two or three found toge|ther. Though they fly rather heavily, flapping their wings like the Blackbird, they probably win|ter in Africa: for on the one hand, the Chevalier des Mazy, Commander of the Order of Malta, a&s;&s;ures me, that they pa&s;s that i&s;land in the month of September, and repa&s;s it in the &s;pring; and on the other, Thevenot &s;ays, that they migrate into Egypt in the month of May, and return in September<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Voyage du Levant, tom. i. p. 493.</BIBL></NOTE>. He adds, that in May they are very fat, and their fle&s;h good eating. Aldro|vandus is &s;urpri&s;ed that in France they are never brought to our tables.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="259">
The Loriot is about as large as the Blackbird; its length nine or ten inches, its alar extent &s;ix|teen, its tail three and a half long, and its bill fourteen lines. The male is of a fine yellow over all the body, the neck, and head, except a black &s;treak which &s;tretches from the eye to the corner of the aperture of the bill. The wings are black, except a few yellow &s;pots, which ter|minate mo&s;t of the great quills, and &s;ome of the coverts: the tail is divided by yellow and black, &s;o that the black prevails on the part which ap|pears of the two mid-quills, and the yellow gra|dually exends over the lateral quills, beginning at the tips of tho&s;e which are next the two mid|dle ones. But the plumage is very different in the two &s;exes. Almo&s;t all that was of a pure black in the male, is, in the female, of a brown, with a greeni&s;h tinge; and what was of a beau|tiful yellow in the former, is in the latter olive and pale brown:&mdash;olive on the head, and the upper part of the body dirty white, variegated with brown &s;treaks under the body, white at the tips of mo&s;t of the wing-quills, and pale yellow at the extremity of their coverts; and there is no pure yellow, except at the end of the tail and on the lower coverts. I have be&s;ides ob&s;erved in a female, a &s;mall &s;pace behind the ear, with|out feathers, and of a light &s;late colour.</P>
<P>The young males re&s;emble the females with re|&s;pect to plumage, and the more &s;o the tenderer their age. At fir&s;t they are &s;till more &s;peckled
<PB N="228" REF="260">
than the female, and even on the upper part of the body; but in the month of Augu&s;t the yel|low begins to appear under the body. Their cry is different al&s;o from that of the old ones; they &s;cream <HI>yo, yo, yo,</HI> &s;ucceeded &s;ometimes with a &s;ort of mewing like that of a cat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner &s;ays, that they pronounce <HI>Oriot,</HI> or <HI>Loriot</HI>; Belon, that they &s;eem to &s;ay <HI>compere loriot</HI>; and others have fancied that they articulated <HI>lou&s;ot bonnes meri&s;es,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. But they have al&s;o a &s;ort of whi&s;tling, e&s;pecially before rain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">GESNER.</NOTE>; if this be not really the &s;ame with the mewing.</P>
<P>Their iris is red, the bill reddi&s;h brown, the in&s;ide of the bill reddi&s;h, the edges of the lower mandible &s;omewhat arched lengthwi&s;e, the tongue forked, and, as it were, jagged at the tip, the gizzard mu&s;cular, terminating in a bag formed by the dilatation of the <HI>oe&s;ophagus,</HI> the gall bladder green, the <HI>coeca</HI> very &s;mall and &s;hort, and the fir&s;t <HI>phalanx</HI> of the outer toe glued to that of the middle toe.</P>
<P>When they arrive in the &s;pring, they feed on caterpillars, worms, in&s;ects, whatever in &s;hort they can catch; but they are fonde&s;t of cherries, figs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hence they have been called <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">, and <HI>Becafigos.</HI> Per|haps the figs improve the quality of their fle&s;h; they do &s;o in the ca&s;e of Blackbirds.</NOTE>, the berries of the &s;ervice tree, peas, &amp;c. A couple of the&s;e birds could in one day com|pletely plunder a rich cherry-tree; for they peck
<PB N="229" REF="261">
the cherries one after another, and only eat the ripe part.</P>
<P>The Loriots are not ea&s;y to breed or tame. They can be caught by the call, placing limed twigs where they drink, and by various &s;orts of nets.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds have &s;ometimes &s;pread from one end of the continent to another, without &s;uffer|ing any alteration in their external form, or in their plumage; for Loriots have been &s;een in Bengal, and even in China, which were pre|ci&s;ely like ours. But others have been brought from nearly the &s;ame countries, which had &s;ome differences in their colours, and which may be regarded, for the mo&s;t part, as varieties of cli|mate, till accurate ob&s;ervations, of their in|&s;tincts, their habits, and manner of life, throw light on our conjectures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Golden Oriole:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is yellow, its &s;traps and joints are black, its outer tail-quills yellow behind.</Q> It &s;eldom or never vi&s;its England.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Of the four principal &s;pecies belonging to our climate, the two fir&s;t, which are the Thro&s;tle

<P>The two other &s;pecies, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fieldfare and the Red-wing, are al&s;o analogous in &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances.

<P>Both &s;exes of the Thru&s;h are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, and equally liable to change their plumage from one &s;ea&s;on to another<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">They have one colour in winter, another in &s;ummer.</Q> <BIBL>ARISTOTLE.</BIBL></NOTE>. In all

of them the fir&s;t <HI>phalanx</HI> of the outer toe is joined to that of the mid-toe, the edges of the bill &s;calloped near the tip. None of them &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on &s;eeds; whether becau&s;e it &s;uits not their ap|petite, or that their bill and &s;tomach are too weak to break and dige&s;t them.

<P>Their fle&s;h is a delicate food, e&s;pecially that of the fir&s;t and fourth &s;pecies, which are the Thro&s;tle and the Red-Wing: but the ancient Romans held it in &s;till higher e&s;timation than we, and kept the&s;e birds the whole year in a &s;ort of voleries, which de&s;erve to be de&s;cribed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Inter aves turdus . . .

<P>Each volery contained many thou&s;and Thru&s;hes and Blackbirds, not to mention other birds excellent for eating, &s;uch as Ortolans, Quails, &amp;c. So numerous were the&s;e voleries in the vicinity of Rome, and in the territory of the Sabines, that the dung of the Thru&s;hes was employed to manure the lands, and what is remarkable, to fatten oxen and hogs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varro, <HI>Dere Ru&s;tic&acirc;.</HI> Lib. i. 31.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="270">
The&s;e Thru&s;hes had le&s;s liberty in their vo|leries than our field pigeons in their dovecotes; for they were never &s;uffered to go abroad, and they laid no eggs: but as they were &s;upplied with abundance of choice food, they fattened to the great profit of the proprietor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Each fat Thru&s;h, except at the time of migration, &s;old for three <HI>denarii,</HI> equal to about two &s;hillings &s;terling.

The vo|leries were a kind of vaulted courts, the in&s;ide furni&s;hed with a number of roo&s;ts. The door was very low, the windows were few, and placed in &s;uch manner as to prevent the pri|&s;oners from &s;eeing the fields, the woods, the birds fluttering at liberty, or whatever might awaken their &s;en&s;ibility, and di&s;turb the calm &s;o conducive to corpulence. A little glimmer|ing was &s;ufficient to direct them to their food; which con&s;i&s;ted of millet, and a &s;ort of pa&s;te made with brui&s;ed figs and flour. They had al&s;o given them the berries of the lenti&s;k, of the myrtle, of the ivy, and whatever in &s;hort would improve the delicacy and flavour of their fle&s;h. They were &s;upplied with a little &s;tream of wa|ter, which ran in a gutter through the volery. Twenty days before they were intended for killing, their allowance was augmented; nay &s;o far was the attention carried, that they gently removed into a little anti-chamber the Thru&s;hes
<PB N="239" REF="271">
which were plump and in good order, to enjoy more quiet; and frequently to heighten the illu&s;ion, they hung boughs and verdure imitat|ing the natural &s;eenery; &s;o that the birds might fancy them&s;elves in the mid&s;t of the woods. In &s;hort, they treated their &s;laves well, becau&s;e they knew their intere&s;t. Such as were newly caught, were put in &s;mall &s;eparate voleries along with others that had been accu&s;tomed to con|finement; and every contrivance, every &s;ooth|ing art, was employed to habituate them &s;ome|what to bondage; yet the&s;e were birds never completely tamed.</P>
<P>We can at pre&s;ent perceive &s;ome traces of the ancient practice, improved indeed by the &s;kill of the moderns. It is common in certain provinces of France to hang pots in the tops of trees which are haunted by the Thru&s;hes; and the&s;e birds finding convenient &s;heltered ne&s;ts, &s;eldom fail to lay their eggs in them to hatch and rear their young<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BELON.</NOTE>. This plan con|tributes doubly to the multiplication of the &s;pe|cies; for it both pre&s;erves the brood, and by &s;aving the time &s;pent in building ne&s;ts, it ena|bles them to make two hatches in the year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It appears even that they &s;ometimes have three hatches; for Salerne found in the month of September a Thru&s;h's ne&s;t in a vine containing three eggs not yet hatched, which appeared to be of the third hatch.</NOTE>. When they find no pots, they con&s;truct their

ne&s;ts in trees or even bu&s;hes, and with great art; they cover the out&s;ide with mo&s;s, &s;traw, dried leaves, &amp;c. but they line the in&s;ide with a hard ca&s;e formed of mud, compacted with &s;traws and &s;mall roots. In this re&s;pect they differ from the Pies and Blackbirds, which lay their eggs on a &s;oft mattre&s;s. The&s;e ne&s;ts are hollow hemi&s;pheres about four inches in dia|meter. The colour of the eggs varies in the different &s;pecies between blue and green, with &s;ome dull &s;pots that are mo&s;t frequent on the large end. Every &s;pecies has al&s;o its peculiar &s;ong; and &s;ometimes they have even been taught to &s;peak<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Agrippina, the wife of Claudius Cae&s;ar, had a Thru&s;h which imitated human &s;peech.</Q> <BIBL>Pliny, lib. x. 42.</BIBL></NOTE>. But this mu&s;t be under|&s;tood chiefly of the Thro&s;tle and the Mi&s;&s;el, in which the organs of voice &s;eem to be the mo&s;t perfect.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the Thru&s;hes &s;wallow the ber|ries entire of the juniper, the mi&s;letoe, the ivy, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>, and void them &s;o little altered, that when they fall in a proper &s;oil, they germi|nate and produce.

<P>The Thru&s;hes have a ventricle more or le&s;s mu&s;cular, no craw, nor even a dilatation of the
<PB N="241" REF="273">
<HI>oe&s;ophagus</HI> which may &s;upply its place, and &s;carce any <HI>caecum</HI>; but all of them have a gall bladder, have the end of the tongue parted into two or three threads, and have eighteen quills in each wing, and twelve in the tail.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are &s;ad and melancholy, and as the natural con&s;equence of that di&s;po&s;ition, they are the more enamoured of liberty. They &s;el|dom play or even fight together; &s;till le&s;s will they bend to dome&s;tic &s;lavery. But their love of freedom is not equalled by their re&s;ources for pre&s;ervation. Their oblique and tortuous flight is almo&s;t their only protection again&s;t the &s;hot of the &s;port&s;man, or the talons of the bird of prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Skilful &s;port&s;men a&s;&s;ure me that Thru&s;hes are difficult to &s;hoot, even more &s;o than Snipes.</NOTE>.

<P>The&s;e noo&s;es are nothing but two or three hor&s;e-hairs twi&s;ted together, and forming a run|ning knot. They are placed round the juni|pers or &s;ervice-trees in the neighbourhood of a fountain or a mere, and when the place is well cho&s;en, and the &s;prings properly &s;et, &s;everal

hundred Thru&s;hes have been caught in a day in the &s;pace of a hundred acres.</P>
<P>It is a&s;certained from ob&s;ervations made in different countries, that when the Thru&s;hes ap|pear in Europe about the beginning of the au|tumn, they arrive from the countries of the north in company with tho&s;e numerous flocks of birds which, on the approach of winter, traver&s;e the Baltic &s;ea, and leave Lapland, Siberia, Livonia, Poland, and Pru&s;&s;ia, for more temperate climates. So abundant are the Thru&s;hes then on the &s;outhern &s;hore of the Baltic, that, according to the computation of Klein, the &s;ingle city of Dantzic con&s;umes every year ninety thou&s;and pairs. It is equally certain that the &s;urvivors which emigrate again after the rigors of winter, direct their cour&s;e towards the north. But the different &s;pecies arrive not all of them at the &s;ame time. In Burgundy, the Thro&s;tle appears the fir&s;t about the end of September, next the Red-Wing, and la&s;t of all, the Fieldfare and the Mi&s;&s;el; but the latter &s;pecies is much le&s;s nu|merous than the three others, which might be expected, &s;ince it is more di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that all the &s;pecies of Thru&s;hes pa&s;s con&s;tantly in the &s;ame number; &s;ometimes they are very few, becau&s;e the &s;ea&s;on has either been unfavourable to their multiplica|tion, or to their migration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome years the Red-Wings are very rare in Provence; and this is the ca&s;e al&s;o in the northern countries.</NOTE>; at other times they

<P>Nor does the i&s;land of Malta appear to limit the migration of the Thru&s;hes towards the

<P>THIS &s;pecies, in the French language, gives name to the whole genus. I have there|fore ranged it in the fir&s;t place, though in point of &s;ize it occupies only the third. It is very common in &s;ome parts of Burgundy, and called by the country people <HI>The Little Thru&s;h</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Grivette.</NOTE>, or <HI>Little Red-Wing</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mauviette.</NOTE>. It commonly arrives every year about the time of vintage, probably at|tracted by the maturity of the grapes; and hence undoubtedly it has received the name of <HI>Vine-Thru&s;h.</HI> It di&s;appears during the fro&s;ts, and again makes a tran&s;ient vi&s;it in the months of March or April before its migration in May. On the departure of the flock, they always leave a few &s;tragglers behind, which are either un|able to follow the main body, or, yielding to
<PB N="247" REF="279">
the mild influence of &s;pring, &s;top and breed in the fore&s;ts that occur in their route<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lottinger a&s;&s;ures me, that they arrive in the months of March and April in the mountains of Lorraine, and that they re|turn in September and October. Hence it would follow that in the&s;e mountains, or rather in fore&s;ts that cover them, they pa&s;s the &s;ummer, and from the&s;e retreats vi&s;it us in autumn. But mu&s;t we apply this local remark of Lottinger's to the whole &s;pecies? Ob|&s;ervations alone will decide.</NOTE>. This is the rea&s;on why &s;ome Thro&s;tles con&s;tantly re|main in our woods, where they build their ne&s;t on the wild apple and pear-trees, and even in junipers and in the bu&s;hes, as has been ob&s;erved in Sile&s;ia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE> and in England<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. Sometimes they fix it in the trunk of a thick tree ten or twelve feet high, and prefer, for the materials, wood rotten and worm-eaten.</P>
<P>They generally pair about the end of winter, and form la&s;ting unions. They make two hatches in the year, and &s;ometimes a third, when their former have not &s;ucceeded. The fir&s;t laying con&s;i&s;ts of five or &s;ix eggs, of a deep blue with black &s;pots, mo&s;t frequent at the large end; and in the &s;ub&s;equent hatches the number regularly dimini&s;hes. It is difficult in this &s;pe|cies to &s;eparate the males from the females; their &s;ize being the &s;ame in both &s;exes, and the co|lours of their plumage, as I have &s;aid, &s;ubject to vary.

Almo&s;t all the other naturali&s;ts agree, that the young males can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed but by their early inclination to chant: for the Thro&s;tle &s;ings de|lightfully, e&s;pecially in the &s;pring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On its fir&s;t arrival, about the end of winter, it has only a fee|ble whi&s;tle, day and night, like the Ortolans.</NOTE>, who&s;e re|turn it announces; and as it breeds &s;everal times in the year, it enjoys a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the vernal plea&s;ures, and may be &s;aid to warble three-fourths of the year. It &s;its whole hours on the top of a tall tree, &s;training its delicate throat.

&s;o that to &s;ucceed in catching the Thro&s;tle, we ought to choo&s;e the proper time; its departure in the morning, and its return in the evening, or the mid-day, when the &s;un's rays are mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive.

<P>Willughby informs us, that this &s;pecies breeds in England, and re&s;ides there the whole year; and he adds, that its fle&s;h is excellent, but par|takes of the quality of its food. Our Thro&s;tle &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in autumn on che&s;nuts, beech-ma&s;t, grapes, figs, ivy-berries, juniper-berries, the fruit of the &s;ervice-tree, and &s;uch like aliments. We are not &s;o certain what it lives upon in the &s;pring. In that &s;ea&s;on it commonly appears on the ground in the woods, in wet places, and among the bu&s;hes which &s;kirt the flooded mea|dows, where it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;earch for earth-worms, &s;nails, &amp;c. If an inten&s;e vernal fro&s;t happens, the Thro&s;tles, in&s;tead of flying to milder climates, retire to the &s;prings, and langui&s;h and pine; and a continuance of this &s;evere weather will de&s;troy many of them. This would &s;eem to &s;hew, that cold is not the &s;ole cau&s;e of their migrations, but that they have a certain circuit to de&s;cribe annually in a given time. It is &s;aid that pomegranates prove a poi&s;on to them. In Bugey, the ne&s;ts of the Thro&s;tles are much &s;ought after, or rather

<P>I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that this &s;pecies was un|known to the ancients; for Ari&s;totle reckons only three kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t.

<P>I have ob&s;erved in a Thro&s;tle which lived &s;ome time with me, that when it was angry it cracked and &s;napped with its bill; its upper mandible was al&s;o moveable, though much le&s;s than the lower; al&s;o its tail was &s;omewhat forked, which is not very evident from the figure<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Thro&s;tle, <HI>Turdus Mu&s;icus,</HI> LINN.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its wing-quills are ferruginous at their inner ba&s;e.</Q> It is nine inches long, and its alar extent thirteen and a half.

<P N="1">1. The WHITE THROSTLE. The &s;ole difference con&s;i&s;ts in the whitene&s;s of its plum|age; a quality which, though commonly a&s;cribed to the influence of the northern cli|mates, may be produced by accidental cau&s;es in the more temperate countries, as we have remarked in the hi&s;tory of the Raven: but this colour is not &s;pread over the whole body, nor is it pure. The brea&s;t and neck are marked with the &s;peckles peculiar to the Thru&s;hes, though far more dilute and faint; the back is &s;haded with a mixture of brown, and the brea&s;t tinged with rufous, as in tho&s;e figured by Fri&s;ch, pl. 33, but without any de&s;cription. Sometimes none of the upper part of the body, except the head, is white, as in that de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus; at other times the lower part of the neck only is marked by a white-cro&s;s-bar, like a half col|lar; and, in different individuals, this colour certainly mingles variou&s;ly with tho&s;e proper to the &s;pecies.&mdash;But di&s;tinctions of that &s;ort can|not form even permanent varieties.</P>

<P>This birds occurs not only in Canada, but in Penn&s;ylvania, Carolina, and as far as Jamaica: it &s;pends only the &s;ummer in the northern pro|vinces; though in the milder regions of the &s;outh it re&s;ides the whole year. In Carolina it haunts the thicke&s;t woods contiguous to the &s;wamps; but in the hotter climate of Jamaica it retires to the fore&s;ts that cover the moun|tains.</P>
<P>The &s;pecimens de&s;cribed or figured by natu|rali&s;ts differ in the colours of their feathers, of their bill, and of their legs; which would imply (if they all belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies), that the plumage of the American Thro&s;tles is no le&s;s variable than tho&s;e of Europe, and that they all &s;pring from a common &s;tem. This conjecture derives force from the numerous analogies which this bird has to the Thru&s;hes, in its &s;hape, in its port, in its propen&s;ity to migrate, and to feed upon berries, in the yellow colour of its internal parts, ob&s;erved by Sloane, and in the &s;peckles
<PB N="256" REF="288">
which appear on its brea&s;t; but it &s;eems the mo&s;t nearly related to our Thro&s;tle and Red-Wing, and a compari&s;on of the points of &s;imi|larity is nece&s;&s;ary to determine the &s;pecies to which it belongs.</P>
<P>This bird is &s;maller than any of our Thru&s;hes, as in general are all the birds of America, if compared with their archetypes in the old con|tinent. Like the Red-Wing, it does not &s;ing, and has fewer &s;peckles than that &s;pecies, and there|fore than any of the genus; like the Red-Wing al&s;o, its fle&s;h is delicate.&mdash;So far the American Thru&s;h re&s;embles the Red-Wing, but it has more numerous relations to our Thro&s;tle; and, in my opinion, more deci&s;ive ones. It has beards round the bill, a &s;ort of yellowi&s;h plate on the brea&s;t; it readily &s;ettles and remains in a coun|try which affords it &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; its cry is like the winter-notes of the Thro&s;tle, and therefore un|plea&s;ant, as generally are the cries of all birds that live in wild countries inhabited by &s;avages. Be&s;ides, the Thro&s;tle, and not the Red-Wing, is found in Sweden, whence it could ea&s;ily mi|grate into America.</P>
<P>This Thro&s;tle arrives in Penn&s;ylvania in the month of May; it continues there the whole of the &s;ummer, during which time it hatches and rai&s;es its young. Cate&s;by tells us, that few of the&s;e Thro&s;tles are &s;een in Carolina, whether becau&s;e a part only &s;ettle of what arrive, or that, as we have already ob&s;erved, they conceal them|&s;elves

In Burgundy, the Mi&s;&s;els arrive in flocks about the months of September and October, coming mo&s;t probably from the mountains of Lorraine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lottinger of Sarbourg a&s;&s;ures me, that &s;uch of the Thru&s;hes as remove from the mountains of Lorraine on the ap|proach of winter, depart in September and October, and return in the months of March and April; and that they breed in the fore&s;ts with which the mountains are covered, &amp;c. This account agrees well with what we have given from our own ob&s;ervation. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s that another remark of that gentleman di&s;|agrees with one of a very intelligent ornithologi&s;t: The latter (M. Hebert) pretends that in Brie the Thru&s;hes a&s;&s;emble at no time of the year; whereas M. Lottinger a&s;&s;erts that in Lorraine they always fly in flocks, and in fact they &s;eem to arrive in troops about Montbard, as I have remarked. Can their habits differ in different countries, or in different times? This is not altogether unexampled; and I mu&s;t add, from a more particular ob&s;ervation, that after the November pa&s;&s;age is over, tho&s;e which remain in our di&s;tricts live &s;eparately till the time of hatching: in &s;hort, that the a&s;&s;ertions of the&s;e two ob&s;ervers may be true, with certain re&s;trictions.</NOTE>.

which remain lay and hatch &s;ucce&s;sfully.

They con|&s;truct both the in&s;ide and out&s;ide with herbage, leaves, and mo&s;s, e&s;pecially the white mo&s;s; and their ne&s;t re&s;embles more that of the Blackbird than of the other Thru&s;hes, except its being lined with bedding. They lay four or five gray-&s;potted eggs; they feed their young with caterpillars, worms, &s;lugs, and even &s;nails, the &s;hell of which they break. The parents eat all &s;orts of berries during the &s;ummer, cherries, grapes, olives, the fruits of the cornel and the &s;ervice-trees; and in winter they &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the berries of the juniper, of the holly, of the ivy, of the buck-thorn; upon beech-ma&s;t, &s;loes, fennel, and, above all, upon mi&s;letoe berries.

<P><PB N="263" REF="297">
The&s;e birds are of a gentle pacific temper; they never fight with one another, but yet are anxious for their own &s;afety.

<P>THIS Thru&s;h is the large&s;t after the Mi&s;&s;el; and like it can hardly be decoyed by the call, but may be caught by a noo&s;e. It differs from the other Thru&s;hes by the yellow colour of its bill, the deeper brown of its legs, and the cinereous &s;ometimes variegated with black, which &s;preads over its head, behind its neck, and upon its rump.</P>
<P>The male and female have the &s;ame cry, which will equally attract the wild Fieldfares in the &s;ea&s;on of migration<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>.

<PB N="266" REF="300">
They haunt the unploughed fields which are inter&s;per&s;ed with juniper bu&s;hes, and when they appear again in the &s;pring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They arrive in England about the beginning of October, and depart in the month of May. <BIBL>BRITISH ZOOLOGY.</BIBL></NOTE>, they prefer the wet meadows.

<P>It is not an uncommon thing to &s;ee the Fieldfares a&s;&s;emble to the number of two or three thou&s;and in a &s;pot where there are ripe &s;ervices, which they devour with &s;uch voracity, that they throw half of them on the ground. After rains they frequently run along the ditches in &s;earch of worms and &s;lugs.

<P>We may infer then that the Fieldfares are of a much more &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition than the Thro&s;|tles or the Mi&s;&s;els. They &s;ometimes go &s;ingle, but for the mo&s;t part they form, as I have al|ready remarked, very numerous flocks, fly in a body, and &s;pread through the meadows in &s;earch of food, never lo&s;ing &s;ight of their &s;ociety.

<P>Linnaeus mentions a Fieldfare, which was bred in the hou&s;e of a wine-merchant, and be|came &s;o familiar that it would run along the ta|ble and drink the wine out of the gla&s;&s;es; it drank &s;o much that it grew bald, but being &s;hut up in its cage and denied wine, it recovered its plumage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> p. 71.</BIBL></NOTE>. This little anecdote pre&s;ents two remarkable facts; the effect of wine upon the feathers of a bird, and the in&s;tance of a tame Fieldfare, which is very uncommon; for the Thru&s;hes cannot be, as I have before &s;aid, ea&s;ily dome&s;ticated.</P>
<P>The Fieldfares are the more numerous in pro|portion to the &s;everity of the weather; they &s;eem to be even a &s;ign of its continuance, for the fowlers and tho&s;e who live in the country judge that the winter is not over as long as the Fieldfares are heard. They retire in &s;ummer into the northern countries, where they breed and find abundance of junipers. Fri&s;ch a&s;cribes to this &s;ort of food the excellent quality he di&s;|covered in their fle&s;h. I own that there is no di&s;puting about ta&s;tes, but I mu&s;t &s;ay that in Bur|gundy this Thru&s;h is reckoned very indifferent eating, and that in general the flavour commu|nicated by juniper is always &s;omewhat bitter. Others a&s;&s;ert that the fle&s;h of the Fieldfares is
<PB N="268" REF="302">
never better or more &s;ucculent than when it feeds on worms and in&s;ects.</P>
<P>The Fieldfare was known by the ancients un|der the name of <HI>Turdus Pilaris</HI>; not becau&s;e it has been always caught with a noo&s;e, as Salerne &s;ays, a quality which would not have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed it from the other Thru&s;hes, but becau&s;e the hairs or black bri&s;tles round its bill, which project forwards, are longer in this &s;pecies than in the Thro&s;tle or the Mi&s;&s;el. We may add, that its claws are very &s;trong, as remarked in the Briti&s;h Zoology. Fri&s;ch relates, that if the young of the Mi&s;&s;el be put in a Fieldfare's ne&s;t, it will feed and educate them as its own; but I would not thence infer, as Fri&s;ch has done, that we might expect to obtain an hybridous race; for no per&s;on &s;urely looks for a new breed be|tween the hen and the drake, though the hen often rears whole hatches of ducklings. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Fieldfare, <HI>Turdus Pilaris:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its tail-quills are black, the outermo&s;t whiti&s;h at the tip of their inner margin, the tail and rump hoary.</Q> It is ten inches long, &s;eventeen broad, and weighs four ounces.

<P>This Thru&s;h is, in point of &s;mallne&s;s, like the American Thru&s;h; its head is ornamented with a &s;ort of crown or cap of bright orange, ver|ging upon red.</P>
<P>The &s;pecimen figured by Edwards, Pl. 252, differs from ours in not being dappled under the belly. It was caught in November 1751, at &s;ea, eight or ten leagues off the i&s;land of St. Domingo; which led Edwards to &s;uppo&s;e that it was one of tho&s;e birds of pa&s;&s;age which every

year leave the continent of North America on the approach of winter, and depart from the Cape of Florida in que&s;t of milder &s;ea&s;ons. This conjecture was verified. Bartram informed Ed|wards, that the&s;e birds arrived in Penn&s;ylvania in the month of April, and remained there dur|ing the whole &s;ummer. He added, that the fe|male built its ne&s;t on the ground, or rather in heaps of dry leaves, where it formed a &s;ort of excavation; that it lined it with gra&s;s, and al|ways cho&s;e the &s;lope of a hill facing the &s;outh, and that it layed four or five eggs &s;potted with brown. Such differences in the colour of the eggs, in that of the plumage, and in the mode of ne&s;tling, &s;eem to point at a nature di&s;tinct from that of our European Thru&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>VI. The LITTLE CRESTED OUZEL of China.</HEAD>
<P>I place this bird between the Thru&s;hes and the Ouzels, or Blackbirds, becau&s;e it has the port and the ground colours of the Thru&s;hes, but without the dapples, which we may con|&s;ider in general as the di&s;tinctive character of that genus. The feathers on the crown of the head are longer than the re&s;t, and the bird can erect them into a cre&s;t. It has a ro&s;e-colour

mark behind the eye; another more con&s;iderable of the &s;ame colour, but not &s;o bright, under the tail; and its legs are of a reddi&s;h brown. Its &s;ize is nearly that of the Lark, and its wings, which when di&s;played extend ten inches, &s;carcely reach, when clo&s;ed, to the middle of the tail. The tail con&s;i&s;ts of twelve tapered quills. Brown more or le&s;s deep is the prevailing co|lour of the upper-part of the body, including the wings, the cre&s;t, and the head, but the four lateral quills on either &s;ide of the tail are tipt with white. The under-part of the body is of this la&s;t colour, with &s;ome tints of brown over the brea&s;t. I mu&s;t not forget two blacki&s;h &s;treaks, which, ri&s;ing from the corners of the bill, and extending over a white ground, make a kind of mu&s;tachoe, which has a remarkable effect.</P>

<P>EVERY remarkable bird has always many names, but if it be at the &s;ame time a na|tive of a foreign climate, this embarra&s;&s;ing mul|titude, di&s;graceful to Natural Hi&s;tory, is in|crea&s;ed by the confu&s;ion of &s;pecies. Such is the ca&s;e with the American Mocking Birds. It is ea&s;y to perceive that Bri&s;&s;on's Mocking Bird, and the Cinereous Blackbird of St. Domingo, <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> No. 558, both belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, the only difference being that the former has &s;omewhat le&s;s of the gray colour in the under-&s;ide of the body than the latter. It will al&s;o appear, from compari&s;on, that Bri&s;&s;on's Blackbird of St. Domingo is likewi&s;e the &s;ame, di&s;tingui&s;hed only by &s;ome lighter or deeper tints on its plumage and its tail-quills, which are hardly at all tapered. In like manner we &s;hall find that the <HI>Tzonpan</HI> of Fernandez is either the female of the <HI>Cencontlatolli,</HI> that is, of the Mocking Bird, as Fernandez him&s;elf &s;u&s;pects, or at lea&s;t a permanent variety of that &s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;toria Avium Novae Hi&s;paniae,</HI> cap. xx.</BIBL>&mdash;Nieremberg calls it <HI>Tzanpan,</HI> <BIBL>Hi&s;t.

It is true that its plumage is le&s;s uniform, be|ing mixed above with white, black, and brown, and below with white, black, and cinereous; but the fundamental colour is the &s;ame, as al&s;o its &s;ize, its general &s;hape, its &s;ong, and climate. We may &s;ay the &s;ame of the <HI>Tetzonpan</HI> and <HI>Centzonpantli</HI> of Fernandez<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Cap. cxv.</BIBL></NOTE>; for in the &s;hort mention which that author has made of it, fea|tures of analogy are to be met with in &s;ize, in colour, and in &s;ong, and no in&s;tance of di&s;parity occurs. Be&s;ides, the re&s;emblance between the names <HI>Tzonpan, Tetzonpan, Centzonpantli,</HI> &s;eems to &s;hew that they mark a &s;ingle &s;pecies, and that the diver&s;ity has ari&s;en from the mi&s;take of the tran&s;criber, or the difference of the Mexican dia|lects.&mdash;La&s;tly, we can &s;carcely he&s;itate to admit among the &s;pecies the bird, called by Bri&s;&s;on the <HI>Great Mocking Bird,</HI> and which he &s;ays is the &s;ame with Sloane's Mocking Bird, though, ac|cording to the dimen&s;ions given by Sloane, this is the &s;malle&s;t of the kind; but Sloane regards it as the <HI>Cencontlatolli</HI> of Fernandez, which Bri&s;&s;on makes his ordinary Mocking Bird. But Bri&s;&s;on has him&s;elf, without perceiving it, admitted the po&s;ition which I hold; for he quotes two pa&s;|&s;ages from Ray, which applied to the &s;ame bird, and refers one to his great, and the other to his &s;mall &s;pecies. The only difference between the two is, that the great Mocking Bird has a

<P>None of the American Mocking Birds re&s;em|bles &s;o much our Thru&s;hes in the &s;peckles on the brea&s;t, as this; but it differs widely from them in the proportions between the tail and wings, the&s;e ending, when clo&s;ed, almo&s;t where the tail begins. The tail is more than four inches long, which exceeds the third of the whole length of the bird, that being only eleven
<PB N="287" REF="321">
inches. Its &s;ize is intermediate between that of the Mi&s;&s;el and the Fieldfare. Its eyes are yel|low, its bill blacki&s;h, its legs brown, and all the upper-part of the body of a fox colour, but with a mixture of brown. The&s;e two colours al&s;o predominate on the wing-quills, though &s;epa|rately; the rufous on the outer webs, the brown on the inner. The great and middle coverts of the wings are tipt with white, which forms two &s;treaks that cro&s;s the wings obliquely.</P>
<P>The under-&s;ide of the body is dirty white, &s;potted with a du&s;ky brown, but the&s;e &s;pots are more &s;traggling than in our Thru&s;hes: the tail is tapered &s;omewhat drooping, and entirely ru|fous. The &s;ong of the French Mocking Bird has &s;ome variety, but not comparable to that of the proper Mocking Bird.</P>
<P>It feeds commonly on a kind of black cher|ries, which are very different from tho&s;e of Eu|rope, &s;ince they hang in clu&s;ters. It remains all the year in Carolina and Virginia, and con|&s;equently is not, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e provinces, a bird of pa&s;&s;age:&mdash;another analogous circum|&s;tance to our Thru&s;hes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Turdus Rufus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is rufous, be|low partly &s;potted with white, its wing-quills of an uniform co|lour, its tail rounded and rufous.</Q> It inhabits North Ame|rica; appears in New-York in May, and retires &s;outhwards in Augu&s;t.

<P>We have here a &s;triking exception to the ge|neral remark made by travellers, that in pro|portion as the plumage of the birds in the New World are rich, elegant, and &s;plendid, &s;o their notes are har&s;h, raucous, and monotonous. The Mocking Bird is, on the contrary, if we believe Fernandez, Nieremberg, and the native Ame|ricans, the &s;weete&s;t chori&s;ter of the feathered race, not excepting the Nightingale. It equals that charming bird in the melody of its &s;ong; but it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es be&s;ides the power of imitating the cries of other animals: hence is derived its name. Nor is it &s;atisfied with barely re-echoing the &s;ounds. It gives them &s;oftne&s;s and grace. Accordingly the &s;avages have be&s;towed upon it the appellation of <HI>cencontlatolli</HI>; that is, four hundred languages; and the learned have em|ployed the epithet <HI>polyglot.</HI> But the Mock|ing Bird mingles action with its &s;ong, and its mea&s;ured movements accompany and expre&s;s the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of its emotions. Its prelude is to ri&s;e &s;lowly with expanded wings, and &s;oon
<PB N="289" REF="323">
&s;ink back to the &s;ame &s;pot, its head hanging downwards. Its action now corre&s;ponds with the varied nature of its mu&s;ic. If the notes are bri&s;k and lively, it de&s;cribes in the air a number of circles cro&s;&s;ing each other; or it a&s;cends and de&s;cends continually in a &s;piral line. If they are loud and rapid, it with equal bri&s;kne&s;s flaps its wings. Is its &s;ong unequal? it flutters, it bounds. Do its tones &s;often by degrees, melt into tender &s;trains, and die away in a pau&s;e more charming than the &s;weete&s;t melody? it gently dimini&s;hes its action, glides &s;moothly above its tree, till the wavings of its wings begin to be imperceptible, at lea&s;t cea&s;e, and the bird re|mains &s;u&s;pended and motionle&s;s in the air.</P>
<P>The plumage of this American Nightingale by no means corre&s;ponds with the beauty of its &s;ong; the colours are very ordinary, and have neither brilliancy nor variety. The upper-&s;ide of the body is a grayi&s;h brown; the upper-&s;ide of the wings and of the tail are &s;till of a deeper brown; only it is interrupted, 1. on the wings by a white mark which cro&s;&s;es it obliquely near the middle of its length, and &s;ometimes a few &s;mall white &s;peckles are &s;cattered on the fore|part. 2. On the tail by an edging of the &s;ame white colour; and la&s;tly, on the head with a circle of the &s;ame, which forms a &s;ort of crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez.</NOTE>, and extending over the eyes appears like two di&s;tinct eye-lids. The under-&s;ide of the body
<PB N="290" REF="324">
is white from the throat as far as the end of the tail. We perceive in the figure given by Ed|wards a few dapples, &s;ome on the &s;ides of the neck, and others on the white of the great co|verts under the wings.</P>
<P>The Mocking Bird approaches the Red-Wing in &s;ize; its tail is &s;omewhat tapered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This appears not in Sloane's figure.</NOTE>, and its feet are blacki&s;h; its bill is of the &s;ame colour, and with long bri&s;tles that grow above the angles of its opening; la&s;tly, its wings are &s;horter than tho&s;e of our Thru&s;hes, but longer than tho&s;e of the French Mocking Bird.</P>
<P>It is found in Carolina, Jamaica, New Spain, &amp;c. It in general loves the hot climates, but can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the temperate. In Jamaica it is very common in the &s;avannas of the woody parts of the i&s;land; it perches on the highe&s;t branch|es, and chants its &s;ong. It often builds its ne&s;t on the ebony trees. Its eggs are &s;potted with brown. It feeds on cherries and the berries of the white-thorn and cornel tree<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Dogwood, <HI>Cornus Florida,</HI> Linn.</NOTE>, and even on in&s;ects. Its fle&s;h is e&s;teemed excellent. It is not ea&s;ily rai&s;ed in a cage; but this may be accompli&s;hed by care and kind treatment. It is be&s;ides a fa|miliar bird, which &s;eems to be fond of man, ap|proaches his dwellings, and even perches on the chimney tops.</P>

<P>THE adult male of this &s;pecies is of a deeper and purer black than the Raven, and hence its Engli&s;h name.

<P>The Blackbirds are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Thru&s;hes not only by the colour of their plum|age, and the different livery of the male and of the female, but by their &s;ong and their natural habits. They never fly in flocks like the

with regard to each other, they are le&s;s &s;o with regard to man; for they
are more ea&s;ily tamed, and live nearer the hamlets. They are al&s;o rec|koned
very crafty, becau&s;e they have a quick &s;ight to de&s;cry the fowler at a
di&s;tance, and &s;hun his approach. But if we &s;tudy their nature more
clo&s;ely, we &s;hall find that they are more re&s;tle&s;s than cunning, more
timorous than &s;u&s;|picious, &s;ince they allow them&s;elves to be caught
with bird-lime, with noo&s;es, and with all &s;orts of &s;nares, provided the
hand which &s;ets the&s;e be concealed.</P>
<P>When they are &s;hut up with other birds, their natural inquietude degenerates into petulance; they pur&s;ue and continually hara&s;s their com|panions in &s;lavery; and for that rea&s;on they cannot be admitted into voleries, where &s;everal kinds of &s;mall birds are kept.</P>
<P>They may be rai&s;ed apart for the &s;ake of their &s;ong; not indeed on account of their na|tural mu&s;ic, which is hardly tolerable except in the fields, but becau&s;e they have a facility of im|proving their notes and of learning others, of imitating tones of different in&s;truments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olina, <HI>Uccelliera,</HI> p. 29.</BIBL></NOTE>, and even the human voice<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olina. <HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>&mdash;<BIBL>Philo&s;trat. <HI>Vita Apollonii,</HI> lib. vii.</BIBL>&mdash;<BIBL>Ge&s;ner, <HI>De Avibus,</HI> p. 606.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the Blackbirds, like the Thru&s;hes, early engage in love, they &s;oon begin to warble; and
<PB N="294" REF="329">
as they have more than one hatch, they chant before the vernal warmth, and continue their &s;train when the other &s;ong&s;ters of the grove droop in &s;ilence.

The Blackbirds ne&s;t is con|&s;tructed nearly like that of the Thru&s;hes, except that it is lined with a matting. It is com|monly placed in bu&s;hes or trees of a moderate height.

The wild Blackbirds feed on all &s;orts of ber|ries, fruits, and in&s;ects; and as no country is &s;o &s;terile as not to afford &s;ome of the&s;e, and as the Blackbird is reconciled to all climates, it is found in almo&s;t every part of the world, but va|rying according to the impre&s;&s;ions which it re|ceives.</P>

<P>The plumage of the Blackbird is &s;ubject, like that of the Raven, the Crow, the Jackdaw, and other birds, to great changes, from the influence of the climate, or from the action of le&s;s ob|vious cau&s;es.

I &s;hould therefore con|ceive that the&s;e, though u&s;ually referred to the Blackbirds, belong really to the Ring-Ouzels.

the top of the head, was of a lighter gray than the under.

<P>ALL the ornithologi&s;ts, who have taken notice of this bird, mention it as very rare, as fo|reign, and little known; that it is &s;een only in its pa&s;&s;age, and the country to which it belongs is un|certain. Linnaeus tells us indeed, that it inhabits Lapland and Switzerland; but he &s;ays nothing with regard to its in&s;tincts and mode of life. Aldrovandus, who fir&s;t de&s;cribed this bird, only remarks that it appears &s;ometimes in the plains near Bologna, where it is known by the bird-catchers under the name of <HI>Sea-Stare, (Storno Marino)</HI>; that it &s;its on the dung-hills, grows very fat, and is excellent eating. Two birds of this kind were found in England, and Edwards &s;uppo&s;es that they were driven thither by the violence of the wind. We have ob&s;erved &s;everal in Burgundy, which had been caught in their pa&s;&s;age, and it is probable that they pur&s;ue their excur&s;ions as far as Spain, if what Klein &s;ays be

language.</P>
<P>The plumage of the male is remarkable; its head and neck, and the quills of its wings and of its tail, are black, with brilliant reflexions which play between green and purple. The belly, the back, the rump, and the &s;mall co|verts of the wings are of a ro&s;e colour, which has two tints, the one light, the other deep, with a few black &s;pots &s;cattered here and there on a kind of &s;capulary, which de&s;cends above as far as the tail, and below to the abdomen. Be&s;ides, its head is ornamented with a &s;ort of cre&s;t which reclines like that of the Chatterer, and which mu&s;t have a fine effect when the bird erects it.</P>
<P>The lower belly, the inferior coverts of the tail and the thighs are of a brown colour; the tar&s;us and the toes of a dirty orange; the bill partly black, and partly fle&s;h-coloured. But the di&s;tribution of the&s;e colours &s;eems not fixed in that part; for in the &s;ubjects which we have ob|&s;erved, and in tho&s;e of Aldrovandus, the ba&s;e of the bill was blacki&s;h, and all the re&s;t of a fle&s;h colour; whereas in tho&s;e examined by Edwards, the point of the bill exhibited the black, which changed by degrees into a dirty orange on the ba&s;e of the bill and on the legs. The under-&s;ide of the tail &s;eemed marbled, the effect produced by the colour of its lower coverts, which are blacki&s;h and tipt with white.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="345">
In the female the head is black like that of the male, but not the neck, nor the quills of the tail and of the wings, which are of a lighter tinge; the colours of the &s;capulary are al&s;o le&s;s vivid.</P>
<P>This bird is rather &s;maller than the common Blackbird; its bill, wings, legs, and toes, are pro|portionably longer. In &s;ize, figure, and even in&s;tinct, it is much more analogous to the Ring-Ouzel, for it likewi&s;e migrates. However, we mu&s;t own, that one of the&s;e Ro&s;e-coloured Ouz|els, which was killed in England, kept com|pany with yellow-billed Blackbirds. Its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, is &s;even inches and three-quarters, and to the ex|tremity of the nails &s;even and a half; its alar ex|tent thirteen or fourteen, and its wings, when clo&s;ed, reached almo&s;t to the middle of the tail. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Turdus Ro&s;eus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is &s;ome|what of a carnation colour, its head, its wings, and its tail, black; the back of its head cre&s;ted.</Q> It very rarely appears in England.

<P>THE name indicates &s;ufficiently the haunts of this bird: it inhabits precipices and moun|tains; it is found in the wilde&s;t parts of Bugey; it &s;its commonly on the large &s;tones, and con&s;tantly without cover; &s;o that it is difficult to get near it with a fowling-piece, for as &s;oon as it perceives the per&s;on, it removes to another place. Its &s;hy|ne&s;s &s;eems to be le&s;s owing to native wildne&s;s, than to its apprehen&s;ions of man, and its expe|rience of his artifices. Nor is it &s;o much ex|po&s;ed as many other birds to danger from that quarter. The lo&s;s of liberty alone is what it has to dread; for though excellent eating, it is more prized on account of its &s;ong, which is &s;oft, va|ried, and much like that of the Pettychaps. It &s;oon acquires the notes of other birds, and even learns our mu&s;ic. It begins by day-break, and welcomes the return of the morning; and it re|news its &s;train with the &s;etting &s;un. If during the night we go near its cage with a light, it

<P>The&s;e birds conceal their ne&s;ts with the utmo&s;t care, and build them in the holes of the rocks, and in the bottom of the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible ca|verns.

<P>Each hatch contains three or four eggs. They feed their young with worms and in&s;ects, on which they live them&s;elves. They can &s;ub&s;i&s;t however on other food, and when they are rai&s;ed in a cage, it &s;ucceeds well to give them the &s;ame pa&s;te as the Nightingales. But they mu&s;t be taken from the ne&s;t; for after they have flown, they cannot be enticed into any kind of &s;nare; and if they be caught by &s;urpri&s;e, they will never &s;urvive their liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FRISCH.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Rock Blackbirds are found in many parts of Germany, in the Alps, in the mountains of Tyrol, in tho&s;e of Bugey, &amp;c. I received a female of this &s;pecies caught on its eggs the 12th of May; it had built its ne&s;t on a rock in the neighbourhood of Montberd, where the&s;e birds are very rare and quite unknown; its colours were not &s;o bright as tho&s;e of the male.

<P>With regard to the plumage, the head and neck are covered as it were with a cinereous cowl, variegated with &s;mall ru&s;ty &s;pots. The back is darker near the neck, and lighter near the tail.

<P>THIS bird has the &s;ame ground colour with the Rock Blackbird; that is, a cinereous blue, without any mixture of orange; the &s;ame &s;ize, the &s;ame proportions nearly, the &s;ame ta&s;te for certain kinds of food, the &s;ame &s;ong, the &s;ame habit of &s;ettling on the &s;ummits of mountains, and of building its ne&s;t in the mo&s;t craggy rocks. In &s;hort, we might be inclined to refer it to the &s;ame &s;pecies. Accordingly, many naturali&s;ts have mi&s;taken the one for the other. The co|lours of its plumage vary &s;omewhat in the de|&s;criptions, and it is probably &s;ubject to real va|riations, ari&s;ing from the difference of the indi|viduals, that of age, of &s;ex, of climate, &amp;c. The male which Edwards has delineated, Pl. XVIII. was not of an uniform blue throughout; the tinge of the upper-part of the body was deeper

<P>Belon, who &s;aw &s;ome of the&s;e birds at Ra|gu&s;a in Dalmatia, tells us, that they are al&s;o found in the i&s;lands of Negropont, Candia, Zante, Corfu, &amp;c.; that they are very much &s;ought for, on account of their &s;ong; but he adds, that they do not inhabit France or Italy. How|ever, the arm of the &s;ea which &s;eparates Dal|matia from Italy is no in&s;urmountable barrier, e&s;pecially to the&s;e birds, which, according to Belon him&s;elf, fly much better than the com|mon Blackbird, and which could at lea&s;t make the circuit and penetrate into Italy by the State of Venice. Be&s;ides, it is a fact that the&s;e Ouzels are found in Italy; the one de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on, and that figured in our <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> No. 250, were both &s;ent from that country.

<P>THIS al&s;o is an inhabitant of the mountains, and famous for its elegant &s;trains. It is well known that Francis I. king of France, took &s;ingular plea&s;ure in li&s;tening to it; and even at pre&s;ent the male of this &s;pecies is tamed and &s;old at a very high price at Geneva and Milan<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olina, Ge&s;ner, Willughby.</NOTE>, and &s;till dearer at Smyrna and Con&s;tantinople<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is &s;ometimes &s;old in the&s;e cities for fifty or a hundred pi|a&s;tres. <BIBL>HASSELQUIST.</BIBL></NOTE>. The native warble of the Solitary Ouzel is ex|tremely liquid and tender, but rather plaintive, as mu&s;t be the &s;ong of every bird which leads a lonely exi&s;tence. It remains always &s;ingle, ex|cept in the &s;ea&s;on of love. At that joyous pe|riod, the male and female not only a&s;&s;ociate to|gether,
<PB N="316" REF="355">
but de&s;ert in company the wild and dreary heights where they had lived &s;eparately, and re&s;ort to the milder abodes of man. They &s;eem to &s;eek &s;pectators of their plea&s;ures, and come forward in tho&s;e intoxicating moments, when other animals court the &s;ilence of retreat. But they lodge at a con&s;iderable height above the &s;urface, and thus in the mid&s;t of population they &s;hun the dangers to which they would be expo&s;ed. They build their ne&s;t with &s;talks of gra&s;s and feathers in the top of a &s;eparate chim|ney, or on the ruins of an old ca&s;tle, or on the &s;ummit of a large tree, and almo&s;t always near a &s;teeple or lofty tower. The male &s;its whole hours or days upon the vane or weather-cock, and &s;oothes the tedious &s;ituation of his mate by a continual warble; but pathetic as are his &s;trains, they are &s;till in&s;ufficient to expre&s;s the warmth and tenderne&s;s of his emotions. A &s;olitary bird feels more delicately and ardently than others. Sometimes he ri&s;es chanting, flap|ping his wings, di&s;playing the feathers of his tail, bri&s;tling tho&s;e on his head, and panting with delight, he de&s;cribes many circles in the air round his beloved mate as the centre.</P>
<P>If the female be &s;cared by any uncommon noi&s;e, or by the &s;ight of any new object, &s;he re|tires into her fort, but &s;oon returns to the ne&s;t, which &s;he never abandons.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the young are hatched, the male cea&s;es to &s;ing, but not to love; he gives another
<PB N="317" REF="356">
proof of his affection by &s;haring in the trouble of rearing the brood, and bringing provi&s;ions in his bill. In animals the ardor of love is ever proportioned to the tenderne&s;s for the off-&s;pring.</P>
<P>They commonly lay five or &s;ix eggs; they feed their young with in&s;ects, on which, and on grapes, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby, Belon, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They arrive in April in tho&s;e countries where they pa&s;s the &s;ummer, and depart about the end of Augu&s;t; they return every year to the &s;ame &s;pot where they fir&s;t fixed their abode. It is uncommon to &s;ee more than two pairs &s;ettled in the &s;ame tract<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is every year a pair of them in the belfry of Sainte-Reine, a &s;mall town in my neighbourhood, &s;ituated on the decli|vity of a hill of moderate height.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The young, when they are taken out of the ne&s;t, are capable of in&s;truction, and they learn to chant or to prattle. They begin to &s;ing at midnight, on the approach of the light of a candle. When well-treated they can live in a cage eight or ten years. They are found on the mountains in France and Italy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, in almo&s;t all the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, e&s;pecially in Zira and Nia, where it is &s;aid they ne&s;tle among the heaps of &s;tones<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t.</NOTE>, and in the i&s;land of Cor|&s;ica, where they are not con&s;idered as birds of pa&s;&s;age<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Artier, Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory at Ba&s;tia.</NOTE>. But in Burgundy, tho&s;e which ar|rive

<P>The &s;ingular habits of this bird, and the charms of its &s;ong, have in&s;pired in the people a &s;ort of veneration for it. I know &s;ome places where it is looked upon as lucky, where they would hardly &s;uffer its ne&s;t to be di&s;turbed, and dread its death as a public misfortune.</P>
<P>The Solitary Ouzel is rather &s;maller than the common Blackbird, but its bill is &s;tronger and more hooked near the point, and the legs are &s;horter in proportion. Its plumage is brown of different &s;hades, and &s;peckled throughout with white, except on the rump, and on the feathers of the wings and tail. Al&s;o, its neck, throat, brea&s;t, and the coverts of the wings, are in the male of a blue tinge, with purple reflexions, en|tirely wanting in the female, which is of an uni|form brown, with yellowi&s;h &s;peckles. In both, the iris is of an orange yellow, the opening of the no&s;trils wide, the edges of the bill &s;calloped near the tip, as in almo&s;t all the Blackbirds and Thru&s;hes; the in&s;ide of the mouth yellow, the tongue parted into three threads, of which the mid one is the longe&s;t; twelve quills in the tail, nineteen in each wing, the fir&s;t of which is very &s;hort: la&s;tly, the fir&s;t <HI>phalanx</HI> of the outer toe

is joined to that of the middle one.

<P>THIS &s;pecies &s;eems to be intermediate be|tween the Solitary Ouzel and the Rock Blackbird. It has the colours of the latter, and di&s;tributed partly in the &s;ame order; but its wings are not &s;o long, though when clo&s;ed they reach to two-thirds of the tail.

<P>The figure of this bird, its port, and its bill, re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Solitary Ouzels, and its plumage is &s;omewhat analogous to that of the Pen&s;ive Ouzel, but it is rather &s;maller. Each feather in the under-&s;ide of the body is rufous of various &s;hades, and edged with brown. The feathers of the upper-&s;ide of the body are brown with a double border, the inner blacki&s;h, and the outer dirty white. The &s;mall coverts of the wings have an a&s;h-ca&s;t, and tho&s;e of the rump and tail are quite cinereous. The head is olive,

<P>I be&s;tow a &s;eparate name on this bird, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e who have &s;een it do not agree with regard to the &s;pecies to which it belongs. Bri&s;|&s;on makes it a Blackbird, and Edwards a Pie or a Shrike. For my own part, I conceive it to be a Ring-Ouzel, not venturing, however, to de|cide, till farther information clear up the &s;ub|ject.
<PB N="333" REF="372">
It is &s;maller than the Blackbird, and its bill proportionably &s;tronger. Its total length is &s;even inches and a half, its alar extent eleven, its tail three and a half, its bill twelve or thirteen lines, and its legs fourteen; its wings when clo&s;ed reach beyond the middle of its tail, which is &s;omewhat tapered.</P>
<P>The black brea&s;t-piece which di&s;tingui&s;hes this bird is the more con&s;picuous, as it is bounded above and below by a lighter colour, for the throat and all the under-part of the body is of a pretty bright yellow. From the two ends of the upper-margin of this brea&s;t-piece ari&s;e two cords of the &s;ame colour, which fir&s;t a&s;cend|ing on each &s;ide towards the head, define the beautiful yellow orange plate on the throat, and then bending under the eyes, terminate at the ba&s;e of the bill, where they are in a manner in|&s;erted. Two yellow eye-brows, which take their origin clo&s;e to the no&s;trils, embrace the eyes above, and form a contra&s;t to the black cords. All the upper-part of this bird is olive; but that colour &s;eems to be tarni&s;hed by a mixture of cinereous on the top of the head, and on the contrary to brighten on the rump, and on the outer edge of the wing-quills; the large&s;t of the&s;e are tipt with brown; the two interme|diate ones of the tail are of an olive green, and al&s;o the whole of the under-part of the body; and the ten lateral ones are black, tipt with yellow.</P>

<P>Bri&s;&s;on has &s;uppo&s;ed that this bird is a native of the Cape of Good Hope; and indeed it was brought from that place by the Abb&eacute; de la Caille. But if we believe Edwards, it belongs to a more di&s;tant climate, that of the i&s;land of Ceylon. That naturali&s;t obtained accurate information on this &s;ubject from John Gideon Loten, who had been governor of Ceylon, and who, on his re|turn from India, pre&s;ented &s;everal birds of that country to the Royal Society, and among the re&s;t a Ceylon Thru&s;h. Edwards introduces here an ob&s;ervation which we have already anticipated, but which it may not be improper to repeat. The Cape of Good Hope is the general rendez|vous of &s;hips trading to the Ea&s;t, and it may often happen, that in touching there, birds may be left which afterwards are mi&s;taken for natives of the extremity of Africa,</P>

It is &s;maller than the Red-Wing: its length is about &s;even inch|es, its alar extent ten and a half, its bill ten lines, and its wings reach to the third of its tail, which is only two inches and a half.

<P>Though at fir&s;t &s;ight this bird &s;eems to re|&s;emble mo&s;t in its plumage that of the follow|ing article, the <HI>Brunet,</HI> and particularly the <HI>Yellow-rumped Blackbird of Senegal,</HI> which I con&s;ider as a variety of the &s;ame &s;pecies, we &s;till perceive obvious differences in its colour, and more important ones in the proportions of its limbs. It is not &s;o large as the Red-Wing; its total length nine inches, its alar extent nine and a half, its tail three and two-thirds, its bill thirteen lines, and its leg fourteen. Its wings, therefore, &s;pread le&s;s than tho&s;e of the Brunet, but its bill, tail, and legs, are proportionably longer. Its tail is al&s;o of a different form, and con&s;i&s;ts of twelve tapered quills; each wing has nineteen, of which the longe&s;t are the fifth and the &s;ixth.</P>
<P>With regard to its plumage, it re&s;embles that bird in the brown colour of the upper-part of its body, but it differs by the colour of its helmet, which is of a &s;hining black; by the rufous co|lour of its rump, and of the upper-coverts of its tail; by the ru&s;ty ca&s;t of its throat, and of the whole of the under-part of its body, as far as

<P>THIS bird is undoubtedly not a Blackbird, for it has neither the appearance nor the &s;hape of one. However, there is &s;ome re&s;emblance in the form of the bill, the legs, &amp;c.

The patient Quadrupedes are glad to get rid of the&s;e, and &s;uffer, without mo|le&s;tation, often ten or twelve Paradi&s;e Grakles to perch on their back at once: but the intruders are not content with this indulgence; the &s;kin need not be laid bare by &s;ome wound; the birds will peck with their bill into the raw fle&s;h, and do more injury than the vermin which they ex|tract. They may indeed be con&s;idered as car|nivorous birds, who&s;e prudence directs them to attack openly none but the weak and the feeble. A young one was known to &s;eize a rat two inches long, exclu&s;ive of the tail, da&s;h it re|peatedly again&s;t the board of its cage, break the
<PB N="384" REF="424">
bones, and reduce every limb to a pliancy &s;uited to its views; and then lay hold of it by the head, and almo&s;t in an in&s;tant &s;wallow it entire. It re&s;ted about a quarter of an hour to dige&s;t it, its wings drooping, and its air languid; but, after that interval, it ran with its u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s, and about an hour afterwards, having found an|other rat, it &s;wallowed that as it did the fir&s;t, and with as little inconvenience.</P>
<P>This bird is al&s;o very fond of gra&s;shoppers; and as it de&s;troys immen&s;e quantities, it is a va|luable gue&s;t in countries cur&s;ed with the&s;e in|&s;ects, and it merits to have its hi&s;tory interwoven with that of man. It is found in India and the Philippines, and probably in the intermediate i&s;lands; but it has long been unknown in that of Bourbon. Not above twenty years ago, De&s;|forges-Boucher, Governor-general, and Poivre, the Intendant, perceiving this i&s;land de&s;olated by gra&s;shoppers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e gra&s;shoppers had been introduced from Madaga&s;car, their eggs being conveyed in the &s;oil with &s;ome plants.</NOTE>, deliberated &s;eriou&s;ly about the means of extirpating the&s;e in&s;ects; and for that purpo&s;e brought &s;everal pairs of Paradi&s;e Gra|kles from India, with the view to multiply them, and oppo&s;e them as auxiliaries to their formi|dable enemies. This plan promi&s;ed to &s;ucceed; when unfortunately &s;ome of the coloni&s;ts, no|ticing the&s;e birds eagerly boring in the new-&s;own fields, fancied that they were &s;earching for grain,
<PB N="385" REF="425">
were in&s;tantly alarmed, and reported through the whole i&s;land that the Paradi&s;e Grakle was pernicious. The cau&s;e was con&s;idered in form: in defence of the birds it was urged, that they raked in new-ploughed grounds, not for the grain, but on account of the in&s;ects, and were &s;o far beneficial. However, they were pro&s;cribed by the council, and two hours after the &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed, not one was to be found in the i&s;land. This prompt execution was followed by a &s;peedy repentance. The gra&s;shoppers gained an a&s;cendency, and the people, who only view the pre&s;ent, regretted the lo&s;s of the Paradi&s;e Gra|kles. De Morave, con&s;ulting the inclinations of the &s;ettlers, procured four of the&s;e birds eight years after their pro&s;cription. They were re|ceived with tran&s;ports of joy. Their pre&s;erva|tion and breeding were made a &s;tate affair; the laws held out to them protection, and the phy|&s;icians on their part declared that their fle&s;h was unwhole&s;ome. After &s;o many and &s;o powerful expedients, the de&s;ired effect was produced; the Paradi&s;e Grakles multiplied, and the gra&s;shop|pers were entirely extirpated. But an oppo&s;ite inconvenience has ari&s;en; the birds, &s;upported no longer by in&s;ects, have had recour&s;e to fruits, and have fed on the mulberries, grapes, and dates. They have even &s;craped up the grains of wheat, rice, maize, and beans; they have rifled the pigeon-hou&s;es, and preyed on the young; and thus, after freeing the &s;ettlers from the
<PB N="386" REF="426">
gra&s;shoppers, they have them&s;elves become a more dreadful &s;courge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are &s;till more pernicious, as they devour the u&s;eful in|&s;ects, particularly that called the <HI>Little Lion,</HI> which preys upon the woolly lice that &s;o much injure the coffee-&s;hrubs.</NOTE>. Their rapid multi|plication renders it difficult to &s;top their pro|gre&s;s; unle&s;s perhaps a body of more powerful rapacious birds were employed again&s;t them; a plan which would &s;oon be attended with other difficulties. The great &s;ecret would be to main|tain a certain number of Paradi&s;e Grakles, and, at the &s;ame time, to contrive to re&s;train their farther multiplication. Perhaps an attentive ob|&s;ervation of the nature and in&s;tincts of gra&s;s|hoppers, would &s;ugge&s;t a method of getting rid of them, without having recour&s;e to &s;uch ex|pen&s;ive auxiliaries.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are not timorous, and are little di&s;turbed by the report of a mu&s;ket. They commonly take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain trees, or even certain rows of trees, often very near ham|lets, to pa&s;s the night. They alight in an even|ing in &s;uch immen&s;e bodies, that the branches are entirely covered with them, and the leaves concealed. When thus a&s;&s;embled, they all be|gin to chatter together, and their noi&s;y &s;ociety is exceedingly trouble&s;ome to their neighbours. Yet their natural &s;ong is plea&s;ant, varied, and ex|ten&s;ive. In the morning they di&s;per&s;e into the fields, either in &s;mall flocks, or in pairs, accord|ing to the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="427">
They have two hatches in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion every year, the fir&s;t being in the middle of &s;pring. The&s;e turn out well, unle&s;s the &s;ea&s;on be rainy. Their ne&s;ts are very rude, and they take no pre|caution to prevent the wet from penetrating. They fa&s;ten them in the leaves of the palm or other trees, and whenever an opportunity pre|&s;ents, they prefer a hay-loft. The&s;e birds are warmly attached to their young. When their ne&s;ts are about to be robbed, they flutter round, and utter a &s;ort of croaking, which indicates their rage, and dart upon the plunderer. Nor do their fruitle&s;s exertions extingui&s;h their af|fection; they follow their brood, which, if &s;et in a window or open place, the parents will care|fully &s;upply with food; nor will they in the lea&s;t be deterred by anxiety for their own &s;afety.</P>
<P>The young Paradi&s;e Grakles are quickly train|ed, and ea&s;ily learn to prattle. If kept in the poultry-yard, they &s;pontaneou&s;ly mimic the cries of all the dome&s;tic animals, hens, cocks, gee&s;e, dogs, &s;heep, &amp;c. and their chattering is accom|panied with certain accents and ge&s;tures, which are full of prettine&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are rather larger than the Black|birds; their bill and legs are yellow as in the&s;e, but longer, and the tail &s;horter. The head and neck are blacki&s;h; behind the eye is a naked reddi&s;h &s;kin, of a triangular &s;hape, the lower-part of the brea&s;t, and all the upper-part of the
<PB N="388" REF="428">
body, including the coverts of the wings and of the tail, of a che&s;nut brown; the belly white, the twelve quills of the tail, and the middle quills of the wings brown; the large ones blacki&s;h, from the tip to the middle, and thence to their origin white; which produces an ob|long &s;pot of that colour near the edge of each wing when it is clo&s;ed; and in this &s;ituation the wings extend to two-thirds of the tail.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the female from the male, by the external appearance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal facts in the hi&s;tory of this bird were commu|nicated by M. M. Sonnerat and De la Nux, corre&s;pondents of the Cabinet of Natural Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS bird is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others by the &s;mall red appendices which terminate mo&s;t of the middle quills of the wings; the&s;e appendices are nothing but the projection of
<PB N="390" REF="431">
the &s;hafts beyond the webs, which as they &s;pread extend into the &s;hape of a pallet, and a&s;|&s;ume a red colour. Sometimes as many have been reckoned as eight appendices on each &s;ide; &s;ome a&s;&s;ert that the males have &s;even, and the females five; others that the females have none at all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>. For my own part, I have &s;een &s;peci|mens which had &s;even in the one wing and five in the other; others which had only three; and others which had none; and at the &s;ame time exhibited other differences in the plumage. La&s;tly, I have ob&s;erved the&s;e appendices &s;ome|times parted longitudinally into two branches nearly equal, in&s;tead of forming as u&s;ual the little pallets of a &s;ingle piece.</P>
<P>Linnaeus has, with great propriety, &s;eparated this bird from the Thru&s;hes and Blackbirds; ob&s;erving, be&s;ides the &s;mall red appendices which di&s;tingui&s;h it, that its proportions are different, its bill &s;horter, more hooked, and armed with a double tooth or &s;callop, which appears near the ends of both mandibles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Li&s;ter a&s;&s;erts that he ob&s;erved, in one of the&s;e birds, that the edges of the upper mandible were not notched near the tip; this may be regarded as an individual variety: but the re|mark corrected a mi&s;take of the Doctor's, who had, like Lin|naeus<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the <BIBL><HI>Fauna Suecica</HI></BIBL>, the Chatterer is termed <HI>Lanius Garrulus.</HI> T.</NOTE>, cla&s;&s;ed the Chatterer with the Shrikes.</NOTE>. But it is not ea&s;y to conceive why he &s;hould range it with the Shrikes, while he admits that it feeds on berries,
<PB N="391" REF="432">
and is by no means carnivorous. There is in|deed a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance between the&s;e and the Shrikes and Red-Backs, in the di&s;po|&s;ition of the colours, particularly on the head, in the &s;hape of the bill, &amp;c.; but the difference of in&s;tinct is more important, and ought to pre|clude their a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to determine the native climate of this bird. We &s;hould be much deceived, if from the names of Bohemian Jay, Bohemian Chatterer, &amp;c. we inferred with Ge&s;ner, Bri&s;|&s;on, and others, that Bohemia is its principal abode. It only migrates thither, as into many other countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>. In Au&s;tria, it is conceived to be a native of Bohemia and of Stiria, becau&s;e it enters by the frontiers of the&s;e regions; but in Bohemia it might be called the bird of Sax|ony, and in Saxony the bird of Denmark, or of other countries on the &s;hores of the Baltic. The Engli&s;h trades a&s;&s;ured Dr. Li&s;ter, that for near a century pa&s;t the Chatterers were very common in Pru&s;&s;ia. Rzaczyn&s;ki tells us, that they vi&s;it Great and Little Poland and Lithuania. Reau|mur was informed from Dre&s;den, that they breed in the neighbourhood of Peter&s;burg. Linnaeus mentions, &s;eemingly on good authority, that they &s;pend the &s;ummer, and con&s;equently breed, in the countries beyond Sweden; but his cor|re&s;pondents did not communicate the detail of
<PB N="392" REF="433">
circum&s;tances. La&s;tly, Strahlemberg told Fri&s;ch that they are found in Tartary in the holes of the rocks, and no doubt they mu&s;t build their ne&s;ts in the&s;e. But whatever be the country which the Chatterers choo&s;e for their re&s;idence, where they enjoy the &s;weets of exi&s;tence, and tran&s;mit them to new generations, it is certain that they are not &s;edentary, but make their excur&s;ions over all Europe. They &s;ometimes appear in the North of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ubject figured and de&s;cribed in the Briti&s;h Zoology was killed on Flamborough-Moor, York&s;hire.

<P>The migrations of the Chatterers are in every country pretty regular with regard to the &s;ea|&s;on; but if the&s;e be annual, as Aldrovandus was told, the birds by no means pur&s;ue con|&s;tantly

the &s;ame route. The young Prince Adam d'Aver&s;perg, Chamberlain of their Im|perial Maje&s;ties, and one of the Lords of Bo|hemia, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t exten&s;ive cha&s;e|grounds, and makes the noble&s;t u&s;e of them, &s;ince he aims at the progre&s;s of Natural Hi&s;tory, informs us, in a Memoir addre&s;&s;ed to the Count de Buffon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Prince &s;ent with his Memoir a &s;tuffed Chatterer from his collection, and pre&s;ented it to the Royal Cabinet.</NOTE>, that this bird flits every three or four years<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Others &s;ay every five years, and others every &s;even years. <BIBL>GESNER.</BIBL></NOTE> from the mountains of Bohemia and Stiria, into Au&s;tria, in the beginning of the autumn; that it returns about the end of that &s;ea&s;on; and that, even in Bohemia, not one is &s;een during the winter. However, it is &s;aid, in Sile&s;ia, the winter is the time when the&s;e birds are found on mountains. Tho&s;e which have &s;trayed into France and England appeared in the depth of the winter, but always in &s;mall num|bers: a circum&s;tance which would &s;hew that they were parted from the great body by &s;ome accident, and too much fatigued, or too young to recover their route. We might al&s;o infer, that France, England, and even Sweden, are not &s;ituated in the cour&s;e of the principal mi|gration; but we cannot draw the &s;ame con|clu&s;ion with regard to Italy, for immen&s;e num|bers of the&s;e birds have there been &s;everal times ob&s;erved to arrive. This was particularly the
<PB N="394" REF="435">
ca&s;e in 1571, in the month of December; at that time it was not uncommon to &s;ee flocks of an hundred or more, and forty were often caught at once. The &s;ame event took place in February 1530<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Italy is warmer than Germany, they might appear there later, and I doubt not but in more northern countries they remain a great part of the winter in years when it is not rigorous.</NOTE>, when Charles V. cau&s;ed him|&s;elf to be crowned at Bologna; for in countries where the&s;e birds appear at di&s;tant intervals, their vi&s;its form an epoch in political hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially &s;ince when they are very numerous, they announce to the frightened imaginations of the people war and pe&s;tilence. From the&s;e ca|lamities we mu&s;t, however, except that of earth|quakes; for in 1551, when the Charterers again appeared, it was ob&s;erved that they &s;pread through Modena, Placentia, and almo&s;t all parts of Italy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, but con&s;tantly avoided Ferrara, as if they had a <HI>pre&s;entiment</HI> of the earthquake which happened &s;oon after, and di&s;per&s;ed even the birds of that country.</P>
<P>We cannot well a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e that deter|mines the&s;e birds to leave their ordinary re&s;i|dence, and to roam into di&s;tant climes. It is not exce&s;&s;ive cold; for they are embodied for their expedition as early as the beginning of au|tumn; and be&s;ides, their migration is only oc|ca&s;ional, happening once in three or four years, or only after &s;ix or &s;even years, and their nume|rous

Are we to a&s;cribe the&s;e migrations to their prodigious multiplication; like the locu&s;ts, and tho&s;e rats of the north called <HI>lemings</HI>; and, as has hap|pened to the human &s;pecies, when they were le&s;s civilized, and con&s;equently &s;tronger, and more independent of the equilibrium which at length e&s;tabli&s;hes it&s;elf between all the powers of nature? Or are the Chatterers compel|led repeatedly by local &s;carcity to quit their abodes, and &s;eek &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in other climates? It is &s;aid that they penetrate far into the arctic regions; and this is confirmed by Count Strah|lenberg, who, as we have already noticed, &s;aw them in Tartary.</P>
<P>When the Chatterer re&s;ides in wine countries, it &s;eems fonde&s;t of grapes; whence Aldrovan|dus calls it <HI>Ampelis,</HI> or <HI>Vine Bird.</HI> Next to the&s;e, it feeds upon the berries of privet, of bramble, of juniper, of laurel; upon almonds, apples, &s;orbs, wild goo&s;eberries, figs, and, in general, upon melting juicy fruits. The one which Al|drovandus kept near three months, would not eat ivy-berries or raw fle&s;h till driven to extremity, and never touched grain. That which they tried to breed in the <HI>menagerie</HI> at Vienna was fed upon crumbs of white bread, ma&s;hed car|rots, brui&s;ed hemp-&s;eed, and juniper berries,
<PB N="396" REF="437">
which it preferred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoire of the Prince d'Aver&s;perg.</BIBL></NOTE>; but in &s;pite of all the care which was taken, it lived only five or &s;ix days. Not that the Chatterer is difficult to tame, but that a bird, which has roamed at will, and been accu&s;tomed to provide its own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, thrives always be&s;t in the &s;tate of liberty. Reaumur remarks, that the Chatterers love cleanline&s;s, and when confined they con&s;tantly void their excre|ments in the &s;ame &s;pot<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> <BIBL>Salerne, p. 253.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are entirely of a &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition; they commonly fly in flocks, and &s;ometimes form immen&s;e bodies. Be&s;ide this general ami|cable turn, and independent of their attachment to the females, they are &s;u&s;ceptible of particular friend&s;hips to individuals of the &s;ame &s;ex. But their affectionate temper, which implies more gentlene&s;s than activity, more &s;ecurity than di&s;|cernment, more &s;implicity than prudence, more &s;en&s;ibility than vigour, precipitates them oftener into danger than &s;uch as are more &s;elfi&s;h. Ac|cordingly, the&s;e birds are reckoned the mo&s;t &s;tupid, and they are caught in the greate&s;t num|bers. They are generally taken with the Thru&s;h, which migrates about the &s;ame time, and their fle&s;h has nearly the &s;ame ta&s;te<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner tells us that their fle&s;h is very delicate, &s;erved up at the be&s;t tables, and the liver e&s;pecially highly valued.

On the other hand, Schwenckfeld &s;ays that it is very indifferent eating, and unwhole&s;ome. This mu&s;t depend much on the quality of the &s;ub&s;tances on which the bird feeds.</NOTE>; which is na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ince they live upon the &s;ame

food. I &s;hall add, that many of them are killed at once, for they &s;it clo&s;e together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They utter their cry as they ri&s;e from the ground; this is <HI>zi, zi, ri,</HI> according to Fri&s;ch, and all tho&s;e who have &s;een them alive; it is rather a chirrup than a &s;ong, and hence their name of <HI>Chatterer.</HI> Reaumur will not even admit that they can chant; but Prince d'Aver&s;|perg &s;ays that their notes are very plea&s;ant. Perhaps, in countries where they breed, they may warble in the &s;ea&s;on of love, while they only chirp or chatter in other places; and when confined in cages they may be totally &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The plumage is agreeable when the bird is &s;till; but when it di&s;plays its wings, expands its tail, and erects its cre&s;t, in the act of flying, its appearance is charming. Its eyes, which are of a beautiful red, &s;hine with uncommon lu&s;tre in the middle of the black band, in which they are placed. This black extends under the throat, and quite round the bill; the different &s;hades of wine colour on its head, back, and brea&s;t, and the a&s;h colour of the rump, are &s;urrounded with a frame enamelled with white, with yellow, and with red, formed by the different &s;pots of the wings and tail: the latter is cinereous at its ori|gin, blacki&s;h in its middle, and yellow at its
<PB N="398" REF="439">
end: the quills of the wings are blacki&s;h, the third and fourth are marked with white near the tip, the five following marked with yellow, and mo&s;t of the&s;e terminated with broad tears of a red colour, of which I have &s;poken in the be|ginning of this article. The bill and legs are black, and &s;horter in proportion than in the Blackbird. The total length of the bird is, ac|cording to Bri&s;&s;on, &s;even inches and three-quar|ters, its tail two and a quarter, its bill nine lines, its legs the &s;ame, and its alar extent thirteen inches. For my part, I have ob&s;erved that the dimen&s;ions were all greater than here &s;tated; owing, perhaps, to difference of age or &s;ex, or even between the individuals.</P>
<P>I am not acquainted with the plumage of the young Chatterers, but Aldrovandus tells us that the margin of the tail is of a duller yellow in the females, and that the middle quills have whiti&s;h marks, and not yellow, as in the males. He adds a circum&s;tance which is hard to believe, though he a&s;&s;erts it from his own ob&s;ervation, that in the females the tail con&s;i&s;ts of twelve quills, but in the males of ten only. It is much more credible that the male &s;pecimens examined by Aldrovandus had lo&s;t two of their quills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Ampelis Garrulus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">The back of its head is cre&s;ted, the &s;econdary wing-quills are membranous, and coloured at the tip.</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>VARIETY of the CHATTERER.</HEAD>
<P>We may ob&s;erve that the Chatterer is pro|portionably much broader acro&s;s the wings than the Blackbird or Thru&s;hes. Aldrovandus has al&s;o remarked, that the <HI>&s;ternum</HI> is of a &s;hape bet|ter adapted for cutting the air, and accelerating its cour&s;e. We need not then be &s;urpri&s;ed that it performs &s;uch di&s;tant journies in Europe; and &s;ince it &s;pends the &s;ummer in the countries of the north, we &s;hould naturally expect to di&s;cover it in America. And this is actually the ca&s;e.

This bird is not above an ounce in weight, according to Cate&s;by; its cre&s;t, when erected, is pyramidal, its bill is black, with a large opening, its eyes placed on a bar of the &s;ame colour, &s;eparated from the ground by two white &s;treaks, the extremity of the tail edged

with a &s;hining white, the upper-part of the head, the throat, and the back, hazel, with a wine-tinge; the coverts and quills of the wings, the lower-part of the back, the rump, and a great part of the tail, of different &s;hades of ci|nereous; the brea&s;t, and the inferior coverts of the tail, whiti&s;h; the belly and flanks of a pale yellow. It appears from this de&s;cription, and from the mea&s;ures which have been taken, that the American Chatterer is rather &s;maller than the European &s;ort; that its wings have le&s;s of the enamel, and are rather of a du&s;kier hue; and that the wings do not extend &s;o far in propor|tion as the tail. But it is undoubtedly the &s;ame &s;pecies; for &s;even or eight middle quills of its wing are terminated by the little red appendices. Brooke, &s;urgeon in Maryland, told Edwards, that the females wanted the&s;e appendices, and that the colours of their plumage were not &s;o bright as tho&s;e of the males. The Cayenne Chatterers which I examined had really not the&s;e appen|dices, and the &s;hades of the plumage were in general fainter, as it commonly happens in the females.</P>

<P>THIS bird is an inhabitant of the temperate climates, from Spain and Italy, as far as Sweden. The &s;pecies, though rather &s;tationary, is not numerous. It appears every year in &s;ome of the provinces of France, and leaves them only for a &s;hort time in the &s;evere&s;t winters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is difficult to reconcile this remark, of which I am certain, with the account given by the authors of the British Zoology, that the Gro&s;beak is &s;eldom &s;een in England, and never except in win|ter. Perhaps, as there are few fore&s;ts in England, there are al&s;o few of the&s;e birds, which re&s;ide only in the woods; and as they approach the hamlets only in winter, ob&s;ervers may never have &s;een them but in that &s;ea&s;on.</NOTE>. It generally inhabits in the woods during the &s;um|mer, and &s;ometimes the vineyards; and in win|ter it re&s;orts near the hamlets and farms. It is a &s;ilent bird which is &s;eldom heard, and &s;eems
<PB N="402" REF="444">
to have no &s;ong or decided warble. Nor is its organ of hearing &s;o perfect as that of other birds, for though it re&s;ides in the fore&s;ts, it can|not be enticed by the call. Ge&s;ner, and mo&s;t naturali&s;ts after him, have &s;aid, that the Gro&s;|beak is good eating. I have ta&s;ted the fle&s;h, but it &s;eemed neither plea&s;ant nor juicy.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved in Burgundy that the&s;e birds are much fewer in winter than in &s;ummer, and that great numbers of them arrive about the 10th of April in &s;mall flocks, and perch among the cop&s;es, building their ne&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Gro&s;beak's ne&s;t was found the 24th of April 1774, on a plum-tree ten or twelve feet high, in the fork of a branch; it was of a round hemi&s;pherical &s;hape, compo&s;ed externally with &s;mall roots and &s;ome lichens, and internally with other &s;mall roots more &s;lender; it contained four eggs &s;omewhat pointed, their great diameter nine or ten lines, their &s;mall diameter &s;ix lines; they were marked with &s;pots of an olive brown, and with irregular blacki&s;h &s;treaks faintly impre&s;&s;ed on a ground of blui&s;h light-green. Note communicated by <HI>M. Gueneau de Montbeillard.</HI></NOTE> on trees, gene|rally at the height of ten or twelve feet, where the boughs divide from the trunk. The mate|rials are, like tho&s;e of the Turtle, dry &s;ticks, matted with &s;mall roots. They commonly lay five blui&s;h eggs &s;potted with brown. We might &s;uppo&s;e that they breed only once a-year, &s;ince the &s;pecies is not numerous. They feed their young with in&s;ects, chry&s;alids, &amp;c.; and when they are about to be robbed of their family, they make a vigorous defence, and bite fiercely. Their thick &s;trong bill enables them to crack nuts, and other hard &s;ub&s;tances; and though
<PB N="403" REF="445">
they are granivorous, they al&s;o live much upon in&s;ects. I have kept them a long time in vo|leries; they reject fle&s;h, but readily eat any thing el&s;e. They mu&s;t be confined in a &s;epa|rate cage, for without &s;eeming at all di&s;com|po&s;ed, or making the lea&s;t noi&s;e, they kill the weaker birds that are lodged with them. They attack, not by &s;triking with the point of the bill, but by biting out a mor&s;el of the &s;kin. When at liberty, they live upon all &s;orts of grain, and ker|nels of fruits; and Orioles eat the pulp of cher|ries, but the Gro&s;beaks break them to obtain the kernel; they feed al&s;o on fir and pine cones, and on beech ma&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This bird is &s;olitary, &s;hy, and &s;ilent; its ear is in&s;en&s;ible, and its prolific powers are inferior to tho&s;e of mo&s;t other birds. It &s;eems to have its qualities concentrated in it&s;elf, and is not &s;ubject to any of the varieties which almo&s;t all proceed from the luxuriance of nature. The male and female are of the &s;ame &s;ize, and much re&s;emble each other.

<P>THE &s;pecies of the Cro&s;sbill is clo&s;ely related to that of the Gro&s;beak. Both have the &s;ame &s;ize, the &s;ame figure, the &s;ame in&s;tincts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch conceives them to be &s;o nearly allied, that they would breed together.</NOTE>. The Cro&s;sbill is di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a &s;ort of deformity in its bill, a character, or rather a de|fect, which belongs to it alone of all the winged tribe. What proves that it is a defect, an error of nature rather than a permanent feature, is, that it is variable; the bill in &s;ome &s;ubjects cro&s;&s;es to the left, in others to the right; but the productions of nature are regular in their de|velopement, and uniform in their arrangement. I &s;hould therefore impute this difference of po|&s;ition to the way in which the bird has u&s;ed its bill, according as it has been more accu&s;tomed to employ the one &s;ide or the other to lay hold of its food. The &s;ame takes place in men, who,
<PB N="406" REF="448">
from habit, prefer the right hand to the left<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be qualified. If habit were the &s;ole cau&s;e of this difference, as many people would be left-handed as right-handed. But the number of the former is very &s;mall, com|pared with that of the latter, and therefore the right-hand mu&s;t by original con&s;titution be &s;tronger than the left, however much the difference is afterwards increa&s;ed from habit. The &s;ame rea&s;oning &s;eems applicable to the Cro&s;sbill. T.</NOTE>. Each mandible of the Cro&s;sbill is affected by an exuberance of growth, &s;o that in time the two points are parted a&s;under, and the bird can take its food only by the &s;ide; and hence if it oftener u&s;es the left, the bill will protrude to the right, and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>But every thing has its utility, and each &s;en|tient being learns to draw advantage even from its defects. This bill, hooked upwards and down|wards, and bent in oppo&s;ite directions, &s;eems to have been formed for the purpo&s;e of detach|ing the &s;cales of fir-cones, and obtaining the &s;eeds lodged beneath the&s;e, which are the principal food of the bird. It rai&s;es each &s;cale with its lower mandible, and breaks it off with the upper; it may be ob&s;erved to perform this manoeuvre in its cage. This bill al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ts its owner in climbing, and it dextrou&s;ly mounts from the lower to the upper bars of its cage. From its mode of &s;crambling, and the beauty of its colours, it has been called by &s;ome <HI>the Ger|man Parrot.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="449">
The Cro&s;sbill inhabits only the cold climates, or the mountains in temperate countries. It is found in Sweden, in Poland, in Germany, in Switzerland, and among the Alps and Pyrenees. It is quite &s;tationary in countries where it lives the whole year; but &s;ometimes it accidentally appears in large flocks in other regions. In 1756 and 1757, great numbers were &s;een in the neighbourhood of London. They do not ar|rive at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, but &s;eem to be rather directed by chance, and many years pa&s;s with|out their being at all ob&s;erved. The Nut-Crack|ers, and &s;ome other birds, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame irregular migrations, which occur only once in twenty or thirty years. The only cau&s;e which can be a&s;&s;igned is, that they have been deprived of their u&s;ual &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the cli|mates where they inhabit, by the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on; or have been driven upon the coa&s;t by the violence of a &s;torm or hurricane: for they arrive in &s;uch numbers, and appear &s;o much exhau&s;ted, that they are carele&s;s of their exi&s;t|ence, and allow them&s;elves to be caught by the hand.</P>
<P>We might pre&s;ume that the &s;pecies of the Cro&s;sbill, which prefers the cold climates, would be found in the north of the New Continent, as in that of the Old: yet no traveller to America has taken notice of it. But be&s;ides the general pre&s;umption which is verified by analogy, there is a fact which &s;eems to prove our opinion; the
<PB N="408" REF="450">
Cro&s;sbill is found in Greenland, whence it was brought to Edwards by the whale-fi&s;hers; and that naturali&s;t, who was better acquainted than any per&s;on with the nature of birds, remarks properly, that both the land and the water &s;ort which inhabit the arctic regions, appear indiffe|rently in the north of America or of Europe.</P>
<P>The Cro&s;sbill is one of tho&s;e birds who&s;e co|lours are the mo&s;t &s;ubject to vary; among a great number we can &s;carcely find two indivi|duals that are exactly &s;imilar; not only are the &s;hades of the plumage different, but the po&s;ition of the colours change with the &s;ea&s;on and the age. Edwards, who examined a prodigious number of them, and &s;ought to mark the limits of variation, paints the male with a ro&s;e co|lour, and the female with a yellowi&s;h green; but in both, the bill, the eyes, the thighs, and the legs, are preci&s;ely the &s;ame in regard to &s;hape and co|lours. Ge&s;ner tells us that he kept one of the&s;e birds, which was blacki&s;h in September, and a&s;&s;umed a red colour in October. He adds, that the parts where the red began to appear, were the under-&s;ide of the neck, the brea&s;t, and the belly; that this red afterwards became yel|low, and that winter e&s;pecially is the &s;ea&s;on when the&s;e changes take place, and that, at dif|ferent times, it is &s;aid they receive a red, yellow, green, and cinereous ca&s;t. We mu&s;t not, there|fore, with our modern nomenclators, reckon as a &s;eparate &s;pecies, or a particular variety, a
<PB N="409" REF="451">
<HI>greeni&s;h Cro&s;sbill</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Loxia Pyrenaica,</HI> Barrere. <HI>Loxia Rufe&s;cens,</HI> Bri&s;&s;on.</NOTE>, found in the Pyrenees, &s;ince it occurs equally in other places; and in certain &s;ea&s;ons it has in all countries that colour. Ac|cording to Fri&s;ch, who was perfectly acquainted with the&s;e birds, which are common in Ger|many, the colour of the adult male is reddi&s;h, or green mixed with red; but they lo&s;e this red, like the Linnets, when they are kept in the cage, and only retain the green, which is more deeply impre&s;&s;ed both in the young and in the old. For this rea&s;on they are called in &s;ome parts of Germany <HI>krinis</HI> or <HI>gr&uuml;nitz,</HI> that is, greeni&s;h bird. The two extreme colours have not therefore been well cho&s;en by Edwards; we mu&s;t not infer, as his figures would &s;ugge&s;t, that the male is red, and the female green; there is every rea&s;on to believe, that in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, and at the &s;ame age, the female differs from the male only in the greater faintne&s;s of the colours.</P>
<P>This bird, which is &s;o analogous to the Gro&s;|beak, re&s;embles it al&s;o in &s;tupidity. One may approach it, fire upon it without &s;caring it, and &s;ometimes even catch it by the hand; and as it is equally inactive and &s;ecure, it falls an ea&s;y victim to all the birds of prey. It is mute in &s;ummer, and its feeble notes are only heard in winter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">GESNER.</NOTE>. It is quite placid in captivity, and
<PB N="410" REF="452">
lives long in a cage. It is fed with brui&s;ed hemp|&s;eed, and this contributes to make it &s;ooner lo&s;e its red<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>. In &s;ummer, its fle&s;h is &s;aid to be good eating<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner and Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds delight only in the dark fore&s;ts of pines and firs, and &s;eem to dread the effulgence of day. Nor do they yield to the genial influence of the &s;ea&s;ons; it is not in &s;pring, but in the depth of winter, that their loves commence. They build as early as January, and their young are grown before the other birds begin to lay. They place their ne&s;ts under the large branches of the pine, fixing them with the re&s;in of that tree, and be&s;mearing them with that &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o that the melted &s;now or the rains cannot pe|netrate. In the young, as in tho&s;e of other birds, the bill, or rather corners of its opening, are yellow, and they hold it always open as long as they are fed by the mother. We are not told how many eggs they lay, but we may pre&s;ume, from their &s;ize and their re&s;emblance to the Gro&s;|beak, that the number is four or five, and that they hatch only once a-year. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Cro&s;sbill, <HI>Loxia Curviro&s;tra,</HI> LINN.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is red, its bill forked.</Q> It is of the &s;ize of a Lark, being &s;ix inches and a half long.</NOTE></P>

<P>This is a native of the temperate climates of America, and figured No. 37, <HI>Pl.

This bird re&s;embles much the Pine Gro&s;beak; the &s;ize, and, in a great mea&s;ure, the plumage, are the &s;ame; the bill is as &s;trong, the tail of the &s;ame length, and the climate is nearly the &s;ame. We might, therefore, but for the cre&s;t, reckon it a variety of that beautiful &s;pecies. The colours in the male are much brighter than in the female, who&s;e plumage is not red, but only reddi&s;h-brown; its bill is al&s;o of a much fainter red, though both have the cre&s;t. I &s;hould range this bird rather with the Bulfinch and the Chaffinch, than with the Gro&s;|beak, &s;ince it &s;ings agreeably; whereas the Gro&s;|beak is &s;ilent. Salerne &s;ay, that the warble of

<P>There is no European &s;pecies to which this foreign bird is more related than the Gro&s;beak. It &s;huns inhabited places, and lives retired in the unfrequented fore&s;ts. It is languid in its amours, and de&s;titute of &s;ong; and its only noi&s;e almo&s;t is made by the &s;trokes of its bill, in piercing the nuts to extract the kernel.&mdash;So far the analogy applies. But it differs from the Gro&s;beak by two remarkable properties; 1&s;t, its bill is indented on the edges; and, 2dly, its feet have only three toes, two before and one

behind, which is an uncommon di&s;po&s;ition, and occurs only in a few &s;pecies. The&s;e two di&s;|criminating features &s;eem to me &s;o important, that the bird required an appropriated name, and I have pre&s;erved that by which it is known in its natal region.</P>
<P>The head, the throat, and the fore-part of the neck, are of a fine red, which extends in a pretty narrow &s;tripe under the body, as far as the lower coverts of the tail. All the re&s;t of the under-part of the body, the upper-part of the neck, the back, and the tail, are black; the upper-coverts of the wings brown, edged with white, the quills of the wings brown, with a greeni&s;h border, and the legs of a very dull red. The wings when clo&s;ed reach not beyond the middle of the tail.</P>

This is &s;urely the only way to avoid con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our Sparrow is too well known to need a de|&s;cription. It is repre&s;ented Nos. 6 and 55. <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> fig. 1. No. 6. is the adult male after it has ca&s;t its feathers; and fig. 1. No. 55. the young male before moulting. The change of colour in the plumage, and in the angles of the mandibles, is general and uniform; but the &s;ame &s;pecies is &s;ubject to accidental varieties; for &s;ome Hou&s;e Sparrows are white, others variegated with brown and white, and others almo&s;t entirely black<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black Sparrows occur in Lorraine; but they are undoubtedly the common &s;ort, which as they lodge con&s;tantly in the gla&s;s-hou&s;es, which are frequent along the foot of the mountains, are &s;moked. Dr. Lottinger, being in one of the&s;e gla&s;s-hou&s;es, ob&s;erved a flock of common Sparrows, among which were &s;everal black ones. An old per&s;on, who dwelt on the &s;pot, told him, that they &s;ome|times appeared &s;o much di&s;gui&s;ed, that they could not be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</NOTE>, and others yellow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. The only dif|ference between the females and the males is,
<PB N="434" REF="478">
that the former are &s;maller, and their colours much fainter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e fir&s;t varieties, &s;ome of which are general and others individual, and which occur in all the European climates, there are others in more di&s;tant regions; which would prove that this &s;pecies is &s;pread from the north to the &s;outh in our continent, from Sweden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE> to Egypt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;per Alpinus.</NOTE>, Senegal, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But in whatever country the Sparrow is &s;ettled, it never is found in de&s;ert places, or at a di&s;tance from the re&s;idence of man. It likes neither woods nor va&s;t plains. It is more frequent in towns than in villages; nor is it &s;een in the ham|lets or farms that are buried in the depth of fo|re&s;ts. It follows &s;ociety to live at their expence; and indolence and voracity lead it to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the provi&s;ions of others. Our granaries, our barns, our court-yards, our pigeon-hou&s;es, and, in &s;hort, all places where grain is &s;pilt, are its favourite re&s;ort. It is extremely de&s;tructive; its plumage is entirely u&s;ele&s;s, its fle&s;h indifferent food, its notes grating to the ear, and its fami|liarity and petulance di&s;gu&s;ting. In &s;ome places Sparrows are pro&s;cribed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In many villages of Germany, the pea&s;ants are obliged an|nually to produce a certain number of Sparrows' heads. <BIBL>FRISCH.</BIBL></NOTE>, and a price &s;et on their heads.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="479">
But what will render them eternally trouble|&s;ome and vexatious, is not only their exce&s;&s;ive multiplication, but their &s;ubtlety, their cunning, and their ob&s;tinacy to abide in places which &s;uit them. They are crafty and artful, ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;h the &s;nares laid for them, and wear out the patience of tho&s;e who try to catch them. It is only in &s;ea&s;ons of &s;carcity, and when the &s;now covers the ground, that the &s;port will &s;ucceed; and little impre&s;&s;ion can be made on a &s;pecies which breeds thrice a-year. Their ne&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of hay, lined with feathers. If you de&s;troy it, they will in twenty-four hours build another; if you plunder the eggs, which are five or &s;ix<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina &s;ays, that they lay &s;ometimes eight, and never fewer than four.</NOTE>, often more, they will in the cour&s;e of eight or ten days lay others; if you drive them from the trees or the hou&s;es, they will re&s;ort in greater numbers to your granaries. Per&s;ons who have kept them in cages, a&s;&s;ure me, that a &s;ingle pair of Sparrows con&s;ume near twenty pounds of corn annually. We may judge from their num|bers what prodigious de&s;truction they mu&s;t make in our fields; for though they feed their young with in&s;ects, and eat many them&s;elves, they principally &s;ub&s;i&s;t on our be&s;t grain. They fol|low the labourer in &s;eed-time, and the reaper in harve&s;t. They attend the thre&s;hers at the barns, and the poulterer when he &s;catters grain to his fowls. They vi&s;it the pigeon-hou&s;es, and even
<PB N="436" REF="480">
pierce the craw of the young pigeons to extract the food. They eat bees, and are thus di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;troy the only in&s;ects u&s;eful to man. In &s;hort, it is much to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome method could be devi&s;ed for de&s;troying them. I have been told, that if &s;ulphur were &s;moaked under the trees, where in certain &s;ea&s;ons they a&s;&s;emble and &s;leep at night, they would be &s;uffocated and drop dead. I have tried the experiment, with|out &s;ucce&s;s, though I took much pains, and was intere&s;ted in the i&s;&s;ue; for I could not get them driven from the neighbourhood of my voleries; and I perceived that they not only di&s;turbed the warbling of my birds, but that by the continual repetition of their har&s;h cry, <HI>tui, tui,</HI> they &s;en|&s;ibly &s;poiled the &s;ong of the Canaries, Si&s;kins, Linnets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I then placed on a wall, covered with great Indian che&s;nuts, in which the Sparrows a&s;&s;em|bled in great numbers in the evening, pots filled with &s;ulphur, mixed with a little charcoal and ro&s;in; and the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances being &s;et on fire, cau&s;ed a thick &s;moke, which had no effect but to waken the birds. As the volume a&s;cended, they removed to the tops of the trees, and then retired to the neighbouring hou&s;es, but not one dropped. I ob&s;erved only that they did not for three days vi&s;it the trees that were &s;moaked, but afterwards returned to their former habit.</P>
<P>As the&s;e birds are hardy, they can be ea&s;ily rai&s;ed in cages, and live &s;everal years, e&s;pecially
<PB N="437" REF="481">
if the females be withheld from them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Some &s;uppo&s;e that the male Sparrows cannot live longer than a year. The proof is, that none are ob&s;erved to have a black beard in the &s;pring, but only &s;ometime after, as if none had &s;urvived the preceding &s;ea&s;on. It is alleged that the fe|males are more vivacious; for they are caught along with young ones, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the hardne&s;s of their bills.</Q> <BIBL>ARIST. <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. x. 7.</BIBL></NOTE>; for it is &s;aid that their exce&s;&s;ive venery abridges the period of their lives. When they are taken young, they are &s;o docile as to obey the voice and catch &s;omewhat of the &s;ong of tho&s;e birds with which they are bred; and being naturally familiar, they become more &s;o in the &s;tate of captivity. But when at liberty, they are rather &s;olitary; and hence, perhaps, the origin of their name<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the French word <HI>Moineau</HI> is derived from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>&s;olus.</HI></NOTE>. Since they never leave our climate, and are always about our hou&s;es, it is ea&s;y to perceive that they commonly fly &s;ingle or in pairs. There are, however, two &s;ea&s;ons in the year when they a&s;&s;emble, not to fly in flocks, but to chirp together, in autumn on the willows by the river &s;ides, and in &s;pring on the firs and other evergreens. They meet in the evening, and in mild weather. They &s;pend the night on the trees, but in winter they are found either alone or with their females in a hole of the wall, or beneath the tiles of roofs. And it is only in exce&s;&s;ive fro&s;ts that five or &s;ix are found lying together, probably to keep them|&s;elves warm.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="482">
The males fight ob&s;tinately for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their females, and in the violence of their &s;truggle, they often fall to the ground. Few birds are &s;o ardent, or &s;o vigorous in their love. They can embrace twenty times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with the &s;ame fire, the &s;ame trepidation, and the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions of rapture. What is &s;ingu|lar, the female fir&s;t &s;hews a degree of impa|tience at a &s;port which mu&s;t fatigue her le&s;s than the male, but which may al&s;o yield her le&s;s plea&s;ure, &s;ince there are no preludes, no ca|re&s;&s;es, no adju&s;tment. Much petulance is &s;hewn without tenderne&s;s, and a flutter of action which betrays only a &s;elfi&s;h appetite. Compare the loves of the Pigeon with tho&s;e of the Sparrow, and you will perceive almo&s;t all the &s;hades from the phy&s;ical to the moral qualities.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds ne&s;tle commonly under the tiles, in the lead-gutters, in holes of the wall, in pots that are erected for them, and often about the &s;ides of windows which have Venetian blinds. A few, however, build their ne&s;ts in trees. I have re|ceived &s;ome of the&s;e which were found in large che&s;nuts and lofty willows. They place them on the &s;ummit of the&s;e trees, and con&s;truct them with the &s;ame materials, <HI>viz.</HI> hay on the out|&s;ide and feathers within; but what is &s;ingular, they add a &s;ort of cap above which covers the ne&s;t, &s;o as to prevent the water from penetrat|ing, and leave an opening for entering at under this cap. When they lodge in holes or covered
<PB N="439" REF="483">
places, they judiciou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;e with this cap. In&s;tinct di&s;covers here a &s;ort of rea&s;oning, and at lea&s;t implies a compari&s;on of two &s;mall ideas. Some Hou&s;e Sparrows, more indolent, though bolder than the re&s;t, do not give them&s;elves the trouble of building, but drive off the Martins, and po&s;&s;e&s;s their ne&s;ts. Sometimes they fight the Pigeons, and e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in the holes.&mdash;This little tribe exhibit therefore habits and in&s;tincts more varied and perfect than mo&s;t other birds. This re&s;ults undoubtedly from their living in &s;ociety. They enjoy the benefits of the dome&s;tic &s;tate without &s;urrendering any por|tion of their independence. Hence that &s;ub|tlety, that circum&s;pection, and that accommo|dation of in&s;tinct to &s;ituations and circum|&s;tances. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Common or Hou&s;e Sparrow, <HI>Fringilla Dome&s;tica,</HI> LINN.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">The quills of its wings and tail are brown, its body gray and black, with a &s;ingle white &s;tripe on its wings.</Q> It is near &s;ix inches long.

We &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o that the two birds, figured No. 224. are only varieties of this. The only thing which weakens this conjecture is, that they were found in climates very di&s;tant from each other: 1. from Macao, the 2d from Java, and the 3d from Cayenne. I &s;till con|ceive, however, that they are varieties of the Black Sparrow; for the climates allotted to them by the importers are not to be con&s;idered
<PB N="442" REF="486">
as certain; and be&s;ides, this &s;pecies may occur equally in the hot countries in both conti|nents.</P>
<P>There are others al&s;o which may be regarded as varieties of this &s;pecies. The <HI>Brazil Spar|row,</HI> of which fig. 1. No. 291. <HI>Pl.

<P>La&s;tly, There is another &s;pecies which we &s;hould range with the Black Sparrow, but for the great difference in the length of the tail. This bird is delineated fig. 1. No. 183. <HI>Pl.

If we have been rightly informed with re&s;pect to the cli|mates, it would appear that the Black Sparrow is found in the Antilles, in Jamaica, in Mexico, in Cayenne, in Brazil, in the kingdom of Juida, in Aby&s;&s;inia, in Java, and as far as Macao; that is, in all the tropical countries, both of the New and of the Old Continent.</P>

<P>THIS bird is undoubtedly of a different &s;pe|cies from the Hou&s;e Sparrow. Though they inhabit the &s;ame climate and the &s;ame tracts, they never a&s;&s;ociate together, and their habits are, for the mo&s;t part, di&s;&s;imilar. The Hou&s;e Sparrow never leaves our dwellings, but lodges and breeds in the walls and roofs. The Tree Sparrow &s;eldom vi&s;its us, lives in the fields, haunts the &s;ides of the roads, perches on &s;hrubs and low plants, and builds its ne&s;t in crevices and holes at a little height from the ground. It is &s;aid to ne&s;tle al&s;o in the woods, and in the hollows of trees; but I have never &s;een them in the woods but tran&s;iently, and they certainly prefer the open fields. The Hou&s;e Sparrow flies heavily, and always to &s;hort di&s;tances; nor can it walk without hopping and making awk|ward movements. The Tree Sparrow, on the contrary, whirls round more &s;martly, and walks better. This &s;pecies is not &s;o numerous as that

have &s;tated? On the contrary, it would &s;eem that there are more varieties
of this &s;pecies in Italy than in France. It inhabits therefore the tem|perate

<P>THIS bird has, as well as the Tree Sparrow, been often confounded with the Hou&s;e Sparrow, though it is of a different &s;pecies. It is larger than either, its bill is &s;tronger, and red rather than black, and it has no habit in com|mon with the Hou&s;e Sparrow. It dwells in the woods, and hence the name that it has received from mo&s;t of the naturali&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;&s;er Sylve&s;tris:</NOTE>. It ne&s;tles in hollow trees, lays four or five eggs, and hatches only once a-year. As &s;oon as the young are able to accompany the parents, that is about the end of July, they a&s;&s;ociate in flocks. The Ring Sparrows are therefore collected &s;ix weeks earlier than the Tree Sparrows, and form al&s;o more nu|merous bodies. They remain united till the &s;ea|&s;on of love, when they &s;eparate with their fe|males in pairs. Though the&s;e birds are inva|riably &s;tationary in our climate, it is probable that they dread the &s;everity of the arctic region, for Linnaeus makes no mention of them in his enumeration of the natives of Sweden.
