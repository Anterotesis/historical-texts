<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING &s;ome Time ago heard, that the Tran&s;lation of <HI>HOMER</HI>'S <HI>Iliad</HI> wou'd be attempted, I re&s;olv'd to confer with the Gentleman who undertook it. I found him of a tall Pre&s;ence, and thoughtful Countenance, with his Hands folded, his Eyes fix'd, and his Beard untrimm'd. This I took to be a good Omen, becau&s;e he thus re&s;embled the <HI>Con|&s;tantinopolitan</HI> Statue of <HI>HOMER</HI> which <HI>Cedrenus</HI> de&s;cribes, and &s;urely nothing cou'd have been liker, had he but arriv'd at the Character of Age and Blind|ne&s;s. As my Bu&s;ine&s;s was to be my Introduction, I told
<PB REF="5">
him how much I was acquainted with the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of <HI>HOMER</HI>; that no one better knows his own Hor&s;e, than I do the Camel of <HI>Bac|tria,</HI> in which his Soul re&s;ided at the Time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wars; that my Acquaintance continued with him, as he appear'd in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet; that I knew him in his next Tran&s;migration into a Peacock; was pleas'd with his Return to Manhood, under the Name of <HI>Ennius</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; and more pleas'd to hear he wou'd &s;oon revive under another Name, with all his full Lu&s;tre, in <HI>England.</HI> This particular Knowledge, added I, which &s;prung from the Love I bear him, has made me fond of a Conver&s;ation with you, in Order to the Succe&s;s of your Tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>The civil Manner in which he receiv'd my Pro|po&s;al encouraging me to proceed, I told him, there were <HI>Arts</HI> of Succe&s;s, as well as <HI>Merits</HI> to obtain it; and that he, who now dealt in <HI>Greek,</HI> &s;hould not only &s;atisfy him&s;elf with being a good <HI>Grecian,</HI> but al&s;o contrive to ha&s;ten into the Repute of it. He might therefore write in the Title-Page, <HI>Tran&s;|lated from the Original GREEK,</HI> and &s;elect a <HI>Motto</HI> for his Purpo&s;e out of the &s;ame Language. He might obtain a Copy of Ver&s;es written in it to prefix to the Work; and not call the Titles of each Book, The Fir&s;t, and Second, but Iliad <HI>Alpha,</HI> and <HI>Beta.</HI> He might retain &s;ome <HI>Names</HI> which the World is lea&s;t acquainted with, as his old Tran&s;lator <HI>Chapman</HI> u&s;es <HI>Ephai&s;tus</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Vulcan, Baratrum</HI> for <HI>Hell</HI>; and
<PB REF="6">
if the <HI>Notes</HI> were fill'd with <HI>Greek</HI> Ver&s;es, it wou'd more increa&s;e the Wonder of many Readers. Thus I went on; when he told me, &s;miling, I had &s;hewn him in|deed a Set of Arts very different from Merit, for which Rea&s;on, he thought, he ought not to depend upon them. A Succe&s;s, &s;ays he, founded on the Ig|norance of others, may bring a temporary Advan|tage, but neither a con&s;cious Satisfaction, nor future Fame to the Author. Men of Sen&s;e de&s;pi&s;e the Affectation which they ea&s;ily &s;ee through, and even they who were dazzled with it at fir&s;t, are no &s;ooner inform'd of its being an Affectation, but they ima|gine it al&s;o a Veil to cover Imperfection.</P>
<P>The next Point I ventur'd to &s;peak on, was the Sort of Poetry he intended to u&s;e; how &s;ome may fancy, a Poet of the greate&s;t Fire wou'd be imitated better in the Freedom of Blank Ver&s;e, and the De&s;cription of War &s;ounds more pompous out of Rhime. But, will the Tran&s;lation, &s;aid he, be thus remov'd enough from Pro&s;e, without greater Incon|veniences? What Tran&s;po&s;itions is <HI>Milton</HI> forc'd to, as an Equivalent for Want of Rhime, in the Poetry of a Language which depends upon a na|tural Order of Words? And even this wou'd not have done his Bu&s;ine&s;s, had he not given the fulle&s;t Scope to his Genius, by choo&s;ing a Subject upon which there could be no Hyperboles. We &s;ee (how|ever he be de&s;ervedly &s;ucce&s;sful) that the <HI>Ridicule</HI> of his Manner &s;ucceeds better than the <HI>Imitation</HI> of it; becau&s;e Tran&s;po&s;itions, which are unnatural
<PB REF="7">
to a Language, are to be fairly derided, if they ruin it by being frequently introduced; and becau&s;e Hyperboles, which outrage every le&s;&s;er Subject where they are &s;eriou&s;ly us'd, are often beautiful in Ridi|cule. Let the <HI>French,</HI> who&s;e Language is not co|pious, tran&s;late in Pro&s;e; but ours, which exceeds it in Copiou&s;ne&s;s of Words, may have a more frequent Likene&s;s of Sounds, to make the Uni&s;on or Rhime ea&s;ier; a Grace of Mu&s;ick, that attones for the Har&s;h|ne&s;s our Con&s;onants and Mony&s;yllables occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After this, I demanded what Air he would ap|pear with? whether antiquated, like <HI>Chapman</HI>'s Ver&s;ion, or modern, like <HI>La Motte</HI>'s Contraction. To which he an&s;wer'd, by de&s;iring me to ob&s;erve what a Painter does who would always have his Pieces in Fa&s;hion. He neither choo&s;es to draw a Beauty in a <HI>Ruff,</HI> or a <HI>French-Head</HI>; but with its Neck uncover'd, and in its natural Ornament of Hair curl'd up, or &s;pread becomingly: So may a Writer choo&s;e a natural Manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf which will always be in Fa&s;hion, without affecting to borrow an odd Solemnity and unintelligible Pomp from the pa&s;t Times, or humouring the pre&s;ent by falling into its Affectations, and tho&s;e Phra&s;es which are born to die with it.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, la&s;tly, whether he would be &s;trictly litteral, or expatiate with further Licen&s;es? I wou'd not be litteral, replies he, or ty'd up to Line for Line in &s;uch a Manner, wherein it is im|po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s in one Language what has been deliver'd
<PB REF="8">
in another. Neither wou'd I &s;o expatiate, as to alter my Author's Sentiments, or add others of my own. The&s;e Errors are to be avoided on either Hand, by adhering not only to the Word, but the Spirit and Genius of an Author; by con&s;idering what he means, with what beautiful Manner he has ex|pre&s;s'd his Meaning in his own Tongue, and how he would have expre&s;s'd him&s;elf, had it been in ours. Thus we ought to &s;eek for <HI>HOMER</HI> in a <HI>Ver&s;ion</HI> of <HI>HOMER</HI>: Other Attempts are but Transformations of him; &s;uch as <HI>Ovid</HI> tells us, where the Name is retain'd, and the Thing alter'd: This will be really what you mention'd in the Com|pliment you began with, a Tran&s;migration of the Poet from one Country into another.</P>
<P>Here ended the &s;erious Part of our Conference. All I remember further was, that having ask'd him, what he de&s;ign'd with all tho&s;e Editions and Com|ments I ob&s;erv'd in his Room? he made An&s;wer, That if any one, who had a Mind to find Fault with his Performance, wou'd but &s;tay 'till it was entirely fini&s;h'd, he &s;hou'd have a very cheap Bar|gain of them.</P>
<P>Since this Di&s;cour&s;e, I have often re&s;olv'd to try what it was to tran&s;late in the Spirit of a Writer, and at la&s;t, cho&s;e the <HI>Battle of the Frogs and Mice,</HI> which is a&s;crib'd to <HI>HOMER</HI>; and bears a nearer Re&s;emblance to his Iliad, than the <HI>Culex</HI> does to the Aeneid of <HI>Virgil. Statius</HI> and others
<PB REF="9">
think it a Work of Youth, written as a Prelude to his greater Poems. <HI>Chapman</HI> thinks it the Work of his Age, after he found Men ungrateful; to &s;hew he cou'd give Strength, Lineage and Fame as he pleas'd, and prai&s;e a Mou&s;e as well as a Man. Thus, &s;ays he, the Poet profe&s;&s;edly flung up the World, and apply'd him&s;elf at la&s;t to Hymns. Now, tho' this Rea&s;on of his may be nothing more than a Scheme form'd out of the Order in which <HI>HOMER</HI>'s Works are printed, yet does the Conjecture that this Poem was written after the Iliad, appear probable, becau&s;e of its frequent Allu&s;ions to that Poem, and particularly that there is not a <HI>Frog</HI> or a <HI>Mou&s;e</HI> kill'd, which has not its parallel In&s;tance there, in the Death of &s;ome Warrior or other.</P>
<P>The Poem it&s;elf is of the Epick Kind; the Time of its Action the Duration of two Days; the Sub|ject (however in its Nature frivolous, or ridicu|lous) rais'd, by having the mo&s;t &s;hining Words and Deeds of Gods and Heroes accommodated to it: And while other Poems often compare the illu&s;trious Ex|ploits of great Men to tho&s;e of Brutes, this always heightens the Subject by Compari&s;ons drawn from Things above it. We have a great Character given it with Re&s;pect to the Fable in <HI>Gaddius de Script. non Eccle&s;.</HI> It appears, &s;ays he, nearer Perfection than the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or <HI>Ody&s;&s;es,</HI> and excels both in Judgment, Wit, and exqui&s;ite Texture, &s;ince it is a Poem perfect in its own Kind. Nor does <HI>Cru&s;ius</HI> &s;peak le&s;s to its Honour, with Re&s;pect to the Moral, when he cries out in an Apo&s;trophe to
<PB REF="10">
the Reader; <Q REND="inline">Whoever you are, mind not the Names of the&s;e little Animals, but look into the Things they mean; call them Men, call them Kings, or Coun&s;ellors, or humane Polity it&s;elf, you have here Doctrines of every Sort.</Q> And indeed, when I hear the <HI>Frog</HI> talk concerning the <HI>Mou&s;e</HI>'s Family, I learn, Equality &s;hou'd be ob&s;erv'd in ma|king Friend&s;hips; when I hear the <HI>Mou&s;e</HI> an&s;wer the <HI>Frog,</HI> I remember, that a Similitude of Manners &s;hou'd be regarded in them; when I &s;ee their Councils a&s;&s;embling, I think of the Bu&s;tles of hu|mane Prudence; and when I &s;ee the Battle grow warm and glorious, our Struggles for Honour and Empire appear before me.</P>
<P>This Piece had many Imitations of it in Antiquity, as the Fight of the Cats, the Cranes, the Starlings, the Spiders, &amp;c. That of the Cats is in the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Li|brary, but I was not &s;o lucky as to find it. I have taken the Liberty to divide my Tran&s;lation into Books (tho' it be otherwi&s;e in the Original) according as the Fable allow'd proper Re&s;ting-Places, by varying its Scene, or Nature of Action: This I did, after the Example of <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> and <HI>Zenodotus</HI> in the Iliad. I then thought of carrying the Grammarians Example further, and placing Arguments at the Head of each, which I fram'd as follows, in Imitation of the &s;hort Ancient <HI>Greek In&s;criptions</HI> to the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<Q><PB REF="11">BOOK I. <L>In <HI>Alpha,</HI> the Ground</L>
<L>Of the Quarrel is found.</L></Q>
<Q>

BOOK II.
<L>In <HI>Beta,</HI> we</L>
<L>The Council &s;ee.</L></Q>
<Q>BOOK III.
<L>Dire <HI>Gamma</HI> relates</L>
<L>The Work of the Fates.</L></Q>
<P>But as I am aver&s;e from all Information which le&s;&s;ens our Surprize, I only mention the&s;e for a Handle to quarrel with the Cu&s;tom of long Arguments before a Poem. It may be nece&s;&s;ary in Books of Controver&s;y or ab&s;tru&s;e Learning, to write an Epitome before each Part; but it is not kind to fore&s;tal us in a Work of Fancy, and make our Attention remi&s;s by a previous Account of the End of it.</P>
<P>The next Thing which employ'd my Thoughts was the Heroes Names. It might perhaps take off &s;omewhat from the Maje&s;ty of the Poem, had I ca&s;t away &s;uch noble Sounds as, <HI>Phy&s;ignathus, Ly|copinax,</HI> and <HI>Crambophagus,</HI> to &s;ub&s;titute <HI>Bluff|cheek, Lickdi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Cabbage-Eater,</HI> in their Pla|ces. It is for this Rea&s;on I have retain'd them
<PB REF="12">
untran&s;lated: However, I place them in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> before the Poem, and &s;ometimes give a &s;hort Cha|racter extracted out of their Names; as in <HI>Po|lyphonus, Pternophagus,</HI> &amp;c. that the Reader may not want &s;ome Light of their Humour in the Ori|ginal.</P>
<P>But what gave me a greater Difficulty was, to know how I &s;hou'd follow the Poet, when he in&s;er|ted Pieces of Lines from his Iliad, and &s;truck out a Sprightline&s;s by their new Application. To &s;up|ply this in my Tran&s;lation, I have added one or two of <HI>HOMER</HI>'S Particularities; and us'd two or three Allu&s;ions to &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets who mo&s;t re|&s;emble him, to keep up &s;ome Image of this Spirit of the Original with an equivalent Beauty. To u&s;e more might make my Performance &s;eem a Cento rather than a Tran&s;lation, to tho&s;e who know not the Nece&s;&s;ity I lay under.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, after all my Care, how the World receives the be&s;t Compo&s;itions of this Nature. A Man need only go to a Painter's, and apply what he hears &s;aid of a Picture to a Tran&s;|lation, to find how he &s;hall be us'd upon his own, or his Author's Account. There one Spectator tells you, a Piece is extreamly fine, but he &s;ets no Value on what is not like the Face it was drawn for, while a &s;econd informs you, &s;uch another is extreamly like, but he cares not for a Piece of Deformity, tho' its Likene&s;s be never &s;o exact.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
Yet notwith&s;tanding all which happens to the be&s;t, when I tran&s;late, I have a De&s;ire to be reckon'd among&s;t them; and I &s;hall obtain this, if the World will be &s;o good-natur'd as to believe Writers that give their own Characters: Upon which Pre|&s;umption, I an&s;wer to all Objections beforehand, as follows:</P>
<P>When I am litteral, I regard my Author's Words; when I am not, I tran&s;late in his Spirit. If I am low, I choo&s;e the narrative Style; if high, the Sub|ject requir'd it. When I am enervate, I give an In&s;tance of ancient Simplicity; when affected, I &s;how a Point of modern Delicacy. As for Beauties, there never can be one found in me which was not really intended; and for any Faults, they proceeded from too unbounded Fancy, or too nice Judgment, but by no means from any Defect in either of tho&s;e Faculties.</P>

<P>_THEY who have di&s;cours'd concerning the Nature and Extent of Critici&s;m, take Notice, That Editions of Authors, the Interpreta|tions of them, and the Judgment which is pa&s;s'd upon each, are the three Branches into which the Art divides it&s;elf, But the la&s;t of the&s;e, that di|rects in the Choice of Books, and takes Care to
<PB REF="16">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="17">
prepare us for reading them, is by the learned <HI>Bacon</HI> call'd the <HI>Chair</HI> of the <HI>Criticks.</HI> In this Chair (to carry on the Figure) have &s;ate <HI>Ari&s;totle, Demetrius Phalereus, Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;en&s;is, Cicero, Horace, Quintillian,</HI> and <HI>Longinus</HI>; all great Names of Antiquity, the <HI>Cen&s;ors</HI> of tho&s;e Ages which went before, and the <HI>Directors</HI> of tho&s;e that come after them, with Re&s;pect to the natu|ral and per&s;picuous Manners of Thought and Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, by which a correct and judicious <HI>Genius</HI> may be able to write for the Plea&s;ure and Profit of Mankind.</P>
<P>But whatever has been advanc'd by Men really great in them&s;elves, has been al&s;o attempted by others of Capacities either unequal to the Under|taking, or which have been corrupted by their Pa&s;&s;ions, and drawn away into partial Violences: So that we have &s;ometimes &s;een the Province of <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> u&s;urp'd, by &s;uch who judge with an <HI>ob|&s;cure Diligence,</HI> and a certain <HI>Dryne&s;s of Under|&s;tanding,</HI> incapable of comprehending a figurative Stile, or being mov'd by the Beauties of Imagi|nation; and at other Times by &s;uch, who&s;e na|tural <HI>Moro&s;ene&s;s in general,</HI> or <HI>particular De&s;igns</HI> of Envy, has render'd them indefatigable again&s;t the Reputation of others.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t Manner is ZOILUS repre&s;ented to us by Antiquity, and with a Character &s;o aban|don'd, that his Name has been &s;ince made U&s;e of to brand all &s;ucceeding Criticks of his Complexion. He has a Load of Infamy thrown upon him, great, in Proportion to the Fame of HOMER, again&s;t whom he oppos'd him&s;elf: If the
<PB REF="18">
one was e&s;teem'd as the very Re&s;idence of Wit, the other is de&s;crib'd as a Profligate, who wou'd de&s;troy the Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> in Order to have his Memory pre&s;erv'd by the en|vious Action. I imagine it may be no ungrate|ful Undertaking to write &s;ome Account of this celebrated Per&s;on, from whom &s;o many derive their Character; and I think the Life of a <HI>Critick</HI> is not un&s;ea&s;onably put before the Works of his <HI>Poet,</HI> e&s;pecially when his Cen&s;ures accompany him. If what he advances be ju&s;t, he &s;tands here as a Cen&s;or; if otherwi&s;e, he appears as an Addition to the Poet's Fame, and is placed before him with the Ju&s;tice of Antiquity in its Sacrifices, when, becau&s;e &s;uch a Bea&s;t had offended &s;uch a Deity, he was brought annually to l is Altar to be &s;lain upon it.</P>
<P>ZOILUS was born at <HI>Amphipolis</HI> a City of <HI>Thrace,</HI> during the Time in which the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Empire flouri&s;h'd. Who his Parents were is not certainly known, but if the Appellation of <HI>Thra|cian Slave,</HI> which the World apply'd to him, be not meerly an Expre&s;&s;ion of Contempt, it proves him of mean Extraction. He was a Di&s;|ciple of one <HI>Polycrates</HI> a Sophi&s;t, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd him&s;elf by writing again&s;t the great Names of the Ages before him; and who, when he is men|tion'd as his Ma&s;ter, is &s;aid to be particularly fa|mous for a bitter Accu&s;ation or Invective again&s;t the Memory of <HI>Socrates.</HI> In this Manner is ZOI|LUS &s;et out to Po&s;terity, like a Plant naturally
<PB REF="19">
baneful, and having its Poi&s;on render'd more acute and &s;ubtile by a Preparation.</P>
<P>In his Per&s;on he was tall and meagre, his Com|plexion was pale, and all the Motions of his Face were &s;harp. He is repre&s;ented by <HI>Aelian,</HI> with a Beard nouri&s;h'd to a prodigious Length, and his Head kept clo&s;e &s;hav'd, to give him a Magi|&s;terial Appearance: His Coat hung over his Knees in a &s;lovenly Fa&s;hion; his Manners were form'd upon an Aver&s;ion to the Cu&s;toms of the World. He was fond of &s;peaking ill, diligent to &s;ow Di&s;&s;ention, and from the con&s;tant Bent of his Thought, had obtain'd that Sort of Readi|ne&s;s for Slander or Reproach, which is e&s;teem'd Wit by the light Opinion of &s;ome, who take the Remarks of ill Nature for an Under&s;tanding of Mankind, and the abrupt La&s;hes of Rudene&s;s for the Spirit of Expre&s;&s;ion. This, at la&s;t, grew to &s;uch a Heighth in him, that he became carele&s;s of concealing it; he threw off all Re&s;erves and Managements in Re&s;pect of others, and the Pa&s;|&s;ion &s;o far took the Turn of a Frenzy, that being one Day ask'd, why he &s;poke ill of every one? <Q REND="inline">It is (&s;ays he) becau&s;e I am not able to do them Ill, tho' I have &s;o great a Mind to it.</Q> Such ex|travagant Declarations of his general Enmity made Men deal with him as with the Creature he affected to be; they no more &s;poke of him as belonging to the Species he hated; and from henceforth his lear|ned Speeches or fine Remarks cou'd obtain no other Title for him, but that of <HI>The Rhetorical Dog.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="20">
While he was in <HI>Macedon</HI> he employ'd his Time in writing, and reciting what he had writ|ten in the Schools of Sophi&s;ts. His Oratory (&s;ays <HI>Dioni&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;en&s;is</HI>) was always of the demon&s;trative Kind, which concerns it&s;elf about Prai&s;e or Di&s;prai&s;e. His Subjects were the mo&s;t approv'd Authors, whom he cho&s;e to abu&s;e upon the Account of their Reputation; and to whom, without going round the Matter in <HI>faint Prai&s;es</HI> or <HI>artificial In&s;inuations,</HI> he us'd to deny their own <HI>Characteri&s;ticks.</HI> With this Gallantry of Oppo&s;ition did he cen&s;ure <HI>Zenophon</HI> for Affecta|tion, <HI>Plato</HI> for vulgar Notions, and <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> for Incorrectne&s;s. <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> in his Opinion, wanted Fire, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> Subtilty, and <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> Humour. But, as to have Reputation was with him a &s;uffi|cient Cau&s;e of Enmity, &s;o to have that Reputa|tion univer&s;al, was what wrought his Frenzy to its wilde&s;t Degree; for which Rea&s;on it was HO|MER with whom he was mo&s;t implacably angry. And certainly, if Envy choo&s;e its Object for the Power to give Torment, it &s;hou'd here (if ever) have the Glory of fully an&s;wering its Intentions; for the Poet was &s;o wor&s;hip'd by the whole Age, that his Critick had not the common Alleviation of the Opinion of one other Man, to concur in his Condemnation.</P>
<P>ZOILUS however went on with indefatigable Indu&s;try in a voluminous Work which he entitled, <HI>The</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>Cen&s;ure of</HI> HOMER: 'Till having at la&s;t fini&s;h'd it, he prepares to &s;end it into the
<PB REF="21">
World with a pompous Title at the Head, in|vented for him&s;elf by Way of Excellency, and thus in&s;erted after the Manner of the Ancients.</P>
<Q><HI>ZOILUS,</HI> the Scourge of <HI>HOMER,</HI> writ this again&s;t that Lover of Fables.</Q>
<P>Thus did he value him&s;elf upon a Work, which the World has not thought worth tran&s;mitting to us, and but ju&s;t left a Specimen in five or &s;ix Quo|tations, which happen to be pre&s;erv'd by the Com|mentators of that Poet again&s;t whom he writ it. If any One be fond to form a Judgment upon him from the&s;e In&s;tances, they are as follows:</P>

<P>Such as the&s;e are the cold Je&s;ts and trifling Quarrels, which have been regi&s;tred from a Compo&s;ition that (according to the Repre&s;enta|tion handed down to us) was born in Envy, liv'd a &s;hort Life in Contempt, and lies for ever bury'd with Infamy.</P>
<P>But, as his De&s;ign was judg'd by him&s;elf won|derfully well accompli&s;h'd, <HI>Macedon</HI> began to be e&s;teem'd a Stage too narrow for his Glory; and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which had then taken Learning in|to its Patronage, the proper Place where it ought to diffu&s;e its Beams, to the Surprize of all whom he wou'd per&s;wade to reckon them|&s;elves hitherto in the Dark, and under the Pre|judices of a fal&s;e Admiration. However as he had prepar'd him&s;elf for the Journey, he was &s;uddenly diverted for a while by the Rumour of the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, which were at that Time to be celebrated. Thither he &s;teer'd his Cour&s;e full of the Memory of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> and others who had &s;ucce&s;sfully recited in that large A&s;|&s;embly; and pleas'd to imagine he &s;hou'd alter all <HI>Greece</HI> in their Notions of Wit before he left it.</P>
<P>Upon his Arrival, he found the Field in its Pre|paration for Diver&s;ion. The Chariots &s;tood for the Race, carv'd and gilded, the Hor&s;es were led in co&s;tly Trappings, &s;ome practis'd to wre&s;tle,
<PB REF="23">
&s;ome to dart the Spear, (or whatever they de|&s;ign'd to engage at) in a Kind of Flouri&s;h before|hand: Others were looking on to amu&s;e them|&s;elves; and all gaily dre&s;s'd according to the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Places. Through the&s;e did ZOILUS move forward, bald-headed, bearded to the Middle, in a long &s;ad-colour'd Ve&s;tment, and inflexibly &s;tretching forth his Hands fill'd with Volumns roll'd up to a va&s;t Thickne&s;s: a Figure mo&s;t venerably &s;lovenly! able to demand Atten|tion upon Account of its Oddne&s;s. And indeed, he had no &s;ooner fix'd him&s;elf upon an Eminence, but a Crowd flock'd about him to know what he intended. Then the Critick ca&s;ting his Eyes on the Ring, open'd his Volume &s;lowly, as con|&s;idering with what Part he might mo&s;t properly entertain his Audience. It happen'd, that the Games at <HI>Patroclus</HI>'s Ob&s;equies came fir&s;t into his Thought; whether it was that he judg'd it &s;ui|table to the Place, or knew that he had fall'n as well upon the Games them&s;elves, as upon HO|MER for celebrating them, and cou'd not re&s;i&s;t his natural Di&s;po&s;ition to give Mankind Offence. Every One was now intently fa&s;ten'd upon him, while he undertook to prove, that tho&s;e Games &s;ignify'd nothing to the Taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> and there|fore only furni&s;h'd an impertinent Epi&s;ode: that the Fall of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Ajax</HI> in Cow-dung, the Squabble of the Chariot-Race, and other Acci|dents which attend &s;uch Sports, are mean or trifling: and a World of other Remarks, for
<PB REF="24">
which he &s;till affirm'd HOMER to be a Fool, and which they that heard him took for &s;tudy'd Invectives again&s;t tho&s;e Exerci&s;es they were then employ'd in. Men who frequent Sports, as they are of a chearful Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o are they Lovers of Poetry: This, together with the Opinion they were affronted, wrought them up to Impatience and further Licen&s;es: There was particularly a young <HI>Athenian</HI> Gentleman who was to run three Chariots in tho&s;e Games, who being an Admirer of HO|MER, cou'd no longer contain him&s;elf, but cry'd out, <Q REND="inline">What in the Name of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> have we here, ZOILUS from <HI>Thrace?</HI></Q> and as he &s;aid it, &s;truck him with a Chariot-Whip. Immediately then a Hundred Whips were &s;een curling round his Head; &s;o that his Face, naturally deform'd, and heighten'd by Pain to its utmo&s;t <HI>Caricatura,</HI> ap|pear'd in the Mid&s;t of them, as we may fancy the Vi&s;age of Envy, if at any Time her Snakes ri&s;e in Rebellion to la&s;h their Mi&s;tre&s;s. Nor was this all the Puni&s;hment they decreed him, when once they imagin'd he was ZOILUS: The <HI>Scyronian</HI> Rocks were near 'em, and thither they hurried him with a general Cry, to that &s;peedy Ju&s;tice which is practis'd at Places of Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is here, that, according to <HI>Suidas,</HI> the Cri|tick expir'd. But we following the more nu|merous Te&s;timonies of other Authors, conclude he e&s;cap'd either by the Lowne&s;s of tho&s;e Rocks whence he was thru&s;t, or by Bu&s;hes which might break his Fall; and &s;oon after following
<PB REF="25">
the Cour&s;es of his fir&s;t Intention, he &s;et Sail for <HI>Aegypt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aegypt</HI> was at this Time govern'd by <HI>Pto|lomy Philadelphus,</HI> a Prince pa&s;&s;ionately fond of Learning, and learned Men; particularly an Admirer of HOMER to Adoration. He had built the fine&s;t Library in the World, and made the choice&s;t, as well as mo&s;t numerous Collection of Books. No Encouragements were wanting from him to allure Men of the brighte&s;t Ge|nius to his Court, and no Time thought too much which he &s;pent in their Company. From hence it is that we hear of <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> tho&s;e univer&s;al Scholars, and candid Judges of other Mens Performances: <HI>Callimachus,</HI> a Poet of the mo&s;t ea&s;y, courteous Delicacy, famous for a Poem on the Cutting of <HI>Berenice</HI>'s Hair; and whom <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;o much admired as to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">It was Rea&s;on enough for him to love a Woman, if &s;he wou'd but tell him he exceeded <HI>Callimachus</HI>;</Q> <HI>Theocritus,</HI> the mo&s;t famous in the Pa&s;toral Way of Writing; And among the young Men, <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> and <HI>Apollonius Rhodius,</HI> the one of whom prov'd a mo&s;t judicious Critick, the other a Poet of no mean Character.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many more fill'd the Court of that munificent Prince, who&s;e liberal Di&s;pen&s;ations of Wealth and Favour became Encouragements to every One to exert their Parts to the utmo&s;t; like Streams which flow through different Sorts of Soils, and improve each in that for which it was adapted by Nature.</P>
<P><PB REF="26">
Such was the Court when ZOILUS arriv'd; but before he enter'd <HI>Alexandria,</HI> he &s;pent a Night in the Temple of <HI>I&s;is,</HI> to enquire of the Succe&s;s of his Undertaking; not that he doubted the Worth of his Works, but his late Misfortune had in&s;tructed him, that others might be ignorant of it. Having therefore perform'd the accu&s;tom'd Sacrifice, and compos'd him&s;elf to re&s;t upon the Hide, he had a Vi&s;ion which foretold of his fu|ture Fame.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf &s;itting under the Shade of a dark Yew, which was cover'd with Hellebore and Hemlock, and near the Mouth of a Cave, where fate a Mon&s;ter, pale, wa&s;ted, &s;urrounded with Snakes, fo&s;t'ring a Cockatrice in her Bo&s;om; and cur&s;ing the Sun, for making the Work of the Deities appear in its Beauty. The Sight of this bred Fear in him; when &s;he &s;uddenly turning her &s;unk Eyes, put on a hideous Kind of a loving Grin, in which he di&s;cover'd a Re&s;emblance to &s;ome of his own Features. Then turning up her Snakes, and interlacing them in the Form of a Turbant to give him le&s;s Di&s;gu&s;t, &s;he thus ad|dre&s;s'd her&s;elf: <Q REND="inline">Go on, my Son, in whom I am renew'd, and pro&s;per in thy brave Undertakings on Mankind: A&s;&s;ert their Wit to be Dulne&s;s; prove their Sen&s;e to be Folly; know Truth only when it is on thy own Side; and acknowledge Learning at no other Time to be u&s;eful. Spare not an Author of any Rank or Size; let not thy Tongue or Pen know Pity; make the living feel
<PB REF="27">
thy Accu&s;ations; make the Gho&s;ts of the dead groan in their Tombs for their violated Fame. But why do I &s;pend Time in needle&s;s Advice, which may be better us'd in Encouragement? Let thy Eyes delight them&s;elves with the future Recompence which I have re&s;erv'd for thy Merit.</Q> Thus &s;poke the Mon&s;ter, and &s;hriek'd the Name of ZOILUS: The Shades who were to bear the &s;ame Name after him became obedient, and the Mouth of the Cave was fill'd with &s;trange &s;upercilious Countenances, which all crowded to make their Appearance. The&s;e began to march before him with an Imitation of his Mien and Manners: Some crown'd with wild Sorrel, others having Leaves of dead Bays mingl'd among&s;t it; while the Mon&s;ter &s;till de&s;crib'd them as he pa&s;s'd, and touch'd each with a livid Track of malignant Light that &s;hot from her Eye, to point where &s;he meant the De&s;crip|tion. <Q REND="inline">They (&s;ays &s;he) in the Chaplets of wild Sorrel, are my Writers of Pro&s;e, who erect Scan|dal into Critici&s;m: They who wear the wither'd Bay with it, are &s;uch who write Po|ems, which are profe&s;&s;edly to an&s;wer all Rules, and be left for Patterns to Men of Genius. The&s;e that follow &s;hall attack others, becau&s;e they are excell'd by them. The next Rank &s;hall make an Author's being read a &s;ufficient Ground of Oppo|&s;ition. Here march my Grammarians skill'd to torture Words; there my Sons of Sophi&s;try, ever ready to wre&s;t a Meaning. Ob&s;erve how faint the foremo&s;t of the Proce&s;&s;ion appear; and
<PB REF="28">
how they are now lo&s;t in yonder Mi&s;ts which roll about the Cave of Oblivion! This &s;hews, it is not for them&s;elves that they are to be known; the World will con&s;ider them only as managing a Part of thy Endowments, and &s;o know them by thy Name while they live, that their own &s;hall be lo&s;t for ever. But &s;ee how my Cave &s;till &s;warms! how every Age produces Men, upon whom the Pre&s;ervation of thy Me|mory devolves. My Darling, the Fates have de|creed it! Thou art ZOILUS, and ZOILUS &s;hall be eternal: Come, my Serpents, applaud him with your Hi&s;&s;es, that is all which now can be done; in modern Times my Sons &s;hall invent louder In&s;truments, and artificial Imitations, Noi&s;es which drown the Voice of Merit, &s;hall furni&s;h a Con&s;ort to delight them.</Q> Here &s;he aro&s;e to cla&s;p him in her Arms, a &s;trange Noi&s;e was heard, the Critick &s;tarted at it, and his Vi|&s;ion for&s;ook him.</P>
<P>It was with &s;ome Confu&s;ion, that he lay mu&s;ing a while upon what he had &s;een; but re|flecting, that the Godde&s;s had giv'n him no An|&s;wer concerning his Succe&s;s in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> he &s;trength|en'd his Heart in his ancient Self-Love and En|mity to others, and took all for an idle Dream born of the Fumes of Indige&s;tion, or produc'd by the dizzy Motion of his Voyage. In this Opi|nion, he told it at his Departure to the Prie&s;t, who admiring the extraordinary Relation, regi|&s;tred it in Hieroglyphicks at <HI>Canopus.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="29">
The Day when he came to <HI>Alexandria</HI> was one on which the King had appointed Games to <HI>Apollo</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> and Honours and Rewards for &s;uch Writers as &s;hou'd appear in them. This he took for a happy Omen at his Entrance, and, not to lo&s;e an Opportunity of &s;hewing him&s;elf, repair'd im|mediately to the publick Theatre, where, as if every Thing was to favour him, the very fir&s;t Accident gave his Spleen a Diver&s;ion, which we find at large in the Proem of the &s;eventh Book of <HI>Vitruvius.</HI> It happen'd that when the Poets had recited, &s;ix of the Judges decreed the Prizes with a full Approbation of all the Audience. From this <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> alone di&s;&s;ented, and de|manded the fir&s;t Prize for a Per&s;on who&s;e ba&s;h|ful and interrupted Manner of &s;peaking made him appear the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful: For he (&s;ays the Judge) is alone a Poet, and all the re&s;t Reciters; and they who are Judges &s;hou'd not approve Thefts, but Writings. To maintain his A&s;&s;ertion, tho&s;e Volumns were produc'd from whence they had been &s;toll'n: Upon which the King order'd them to be formally try'd for Theft, and di&s;mi&s;s'd with Infamy; but plac'd <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> over his Library, as One, who had given a Proof of his Knowledge in Books. This Pa&s;&s;age ZOILUS often afterwards repeated with Plea&s;ure, for the Number of Di&s;graces which happen'd in it to the Pretenders in Poetry; tho' his Envy made him &s;till careful not to name <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> but a Judge in general.</P>
<P><PB REF="30">
However, Critici&s;m had only a &s;hort Triumph over Poetry, when he made the next Turn his own, by &s;tepping forward into the Place of re|citing. Here he immediately rais'd the Curio&s;ity, and drew the Attention of both King and People: But, as it happen'd, neither the one nor the other la&s;ted; for the fir&s;t Sentence where he had regi&s;tred his own <HI>Name,</HI> &s;atisfied their Curio&s;ity; and the next, where he offer'd to prove to a Court &s;o devoted to <HI>Homer,</HI> that he was ridicu|lous in every thing, went near to fini&s;h his Audi|ence. He was neverthele&s;s heard quietly for &s;ome Time, till the King &s;eeing no End of his Abu&s;ing the Prince of Philological Learning, (as <HI>Vitruvius</HI> words it) departed in Di&s;dain. The Judges follow'd, deriding his Attempt as an Ex|travagance which cou'd not demand their Gra|vity; and the People taking a Licen&s;e from the Pre|cedent, hooted him away with Obloquy and In|dignation. Thus <HI>Zoilus</HI> fail'd at his fir&s;t Ap|pearance, and was forc'd to retire, &s;tung with a mo&s;t impatient Sen&s;e of publick Contempt.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, he did not omit his Attendance at Court on the Day following, with a Petition that he might be put upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Learning, and allow'd a Pen|&s;ion. This the King read, but return'd no An|&s;wer: So great was the Scorn he conceiv'd again&s;t him. But ZOILUS &s;till undauntedly renew'd his Petitions, 'till <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> being weary of his Per|&s;ecution, gave him a flat Denial. HOMER, (&s;ays
<PB REF="31">
the Prince) who has been dead the&s;e Thou&s;and Years, has maintain'd Thou&s;ands of People; and ZOILUS, who boa&s;ts he has more Wit than he, ought not only to maintain him&s;elf, but many others al&s;o.</P>
<P>His Petitions being thrown carele&s;ly about, were fall'n into the Hands of Men of Wit, whom, according to his Cu&s;tom, he had provok'd, and whom it is un&s;afe to provoke if you wou'd live unexpos'd. I can compare them to nothing more properly, than to the Bee, a Creature wing'd and lively, fond to rove through the choice&s;t Flowers of Nature, and ble&s;t at home among the Sweets of its own Compo&s;ition: Not ill-na|tur'd, yet quick to revenge an Injury; not wear|ing its Sting out of the Sheath, yet able to wound more &s;orely than its Appearance wou'd threaten. Now the&s;e being made per&s;onal Enemies by his malicious Expre&s;&s;ions, the Court rung with Pe|titions of ZOILUS tran&s;vers'd; new Petitions drawn up for him; Catalogues of his Merits, &s;uppos'd to be collected by him&s;elf; his Com|plaints of Man's Inju&s;tice &s;et to a Harp out of Tune, and a Hundred other Sports of Fancy, with which their Epigrams play'd upon him. The&s;e were the Ways of Writing which ZOILUS hated, becau&s;e they were not only read, but re|tain'd ea&s;ily, by Rea&s;on of their Spirit, Humour, and Brevity; and becau&s;e they not only make the Man a Je&s;t upon whom they are written, but a further Je&s;t, if he attempt to an&s;wer them gravely.
<PB REF="32">
However, he did what he cou'd in Revenge; he endeavour'd to &s;et tho&s;e whom he envy'd at Variance among them&s;elves, and invented Lies to promote his De&s;ign. He told <HI>Erato&s;thenes,</HI> that <HI>Callimachus</HI> &s;aid, his Extent of Learning con&s;i&s;ted but in a &s;uperficial Knowledge of the Sciences; and whi&s;per'd <HI>Callimachus,</HI> that <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> only al|low'd him to have an artful habitual Knack of Ver|&s;ifying. He would have made <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> believe, that <HI>Theocritus</HI> rally'd his Knowledge in Editions as a curious Kind of Triffling; and <HI>Theocritus,</HI> that <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> derided the ru&s;tical Simplicity of his Shepherds. Tho' of all his Stories, that which he mo&s;t valu'd him&s;elf for, was his con&s;tant Report, that every one whom he hated was a Friend to <HI>Antiochus</HI> King of <HI>Syria,</HI> the Enemy of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI></P>
<P>But Malice is un&s;ucce&s;sful when the Character of its Agent is known: They grew more Friends to one another, by imagining, that even what had been &s;aid, as well as what had not, was all of ZOILUS'S Invention; and as he grew more and more the common Je&s;t, their Deri&s;ion of him became a Kind of Life and Cement to their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Contempt, Poverty, and other Misfortunes had now &s;o a&s;&s;aulted him, that even they who abhorr'd his Temper, contributed &s;omething to his Support, in common Humanity. Yet &s;till his Envy, like a vitiated Stomach, converted every Kindne&s;s to the Nouri&s;hment of his Di&s;ea&s;e; and 'twas the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life to revile HOMER,
<PB REF="33">
and tho&s;e by whom he him&s;elf &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. In this Humour he had Days, which were &s;o given up to <HI>impatient Ill-nature,</HI> that he cou'd neither write any Thing, nor conver&s;e with any One. The&s;e he &s;ometimes employ'd in throwing Stones at Chil|dren; which was once &s;o unhappily return'd up|on him, that he was taken up for dead: And this occa&s;ion'd the Report in &s;ome Authors, of his being &s;ton'd to Death in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> Or, &s;ometimes he convey'd him&s;elf into the Library, where he blotted the Name of HOMER wherever he could meet it, and tore the be&s;t Editions of &s;everal Volumns; for which the Librarians debarr'd him the Privilege of that Place. The&s;e and other Mi&s;chiefs made him univer&s;ally &s;hunn'd; nay, to &s;uch an Extravagance was his Character of Envy carry'd, that the more &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Aegyptians</HI> imagin'd they were fa&s;cinated by him, if the Day were darker, or them&s;elves a little heavier than ordinary; &s;ome wore Sprigs of Rue, by Way of Prevention; and others, Rings made of the Hoof of a wild A&s;s for Amulets, le&s;t they &s;hou'd &s;uffer, by his fixing an Eye upon them.</P>
<P>It was now near the Time, when that &s;plen|did Temple which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> built in Honour of HOMER, was to be open'd with a &s;olemn Mag|nificence: For this the Men of Genius were employ'd in finding a proper Pageant. At la&s;t, they agreed by one Con&s;ent, to have ZOILUS, the utter Enemy of HOMER, hang'd in Effigie;
<PB REF="34">
and the Day being come, it was on this Manner they form'd the Proce&s;&s;ion. Twelve beautiful Boys, lightly habited in white, with purple Wings repre&s;enting the <HI>Hours,</HI> went on the foremo&s;t: After the&s;e came a Chariot exceeding high and &s;tately, where &s;ate one repre&s;enting <HI>Apollo,</HI> with another at his Feet, who in this Pomp &s;u&s;tain'd the Per&s;on of HOMER: <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Lawrel had little gilded Points, like the Appearance of Rays between its Leaves; HOMER'S was bound with a blue Fillet, like that which is worn by the Prie&s;ts of the Deity: <HI>Apollo</HI> was di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the golden Harp he bore; HOMER, by a Vo|lumn, richly beautify'd with Horns of inlaid Ivory, and Ta&s;&s;els of Silver depending from them. Behind the&s;e came three Chariots, in which rode nine Dam&s;els, each of them with that In&s;trument which is proper to each of the Mu&s;es; among whom, <HI>Calliope,</HI> to give her the Honour of the Day, &s;ate in the Middle of the &s;econd Chariot, known by her richer Ve&s;tments. After the&s;e march'd a &s;olemn Train aptly habited, like tho&s;e Sciences which acknowledge their Ri&s;e or Improvement from this Poet. Then the Men of Learning who attended the Court, with Wreaths, and Rods or Scepters of Lawrel, as taking upon them&s;elves the Repre&s;entation of <HI>Rhap&s;odi&s;ts,</HI> to do Honour, for the Time, to HOMER. In the Rear of all was &s;lowly drawn along an odd Carriage, rather than a Chariot,
<PB REF="35">
which had its Sides artfully turn'd, and carv'd &s;o as to bear a Re&s;emblance to the Heads of &s;narling Ma&s;tiffs. In this was born, as led in Triumph, a tall Image of Deformity, who&s;e Head was bald, and wound about with Nettles for a Chaplet. The Tongue lay lolling out, to &s;hew a Contempt of Mankind, and was fork'd at the End, to con|fe&s;s its Love to Detraction. The Hands were manacled behind, and the Fingers arm'd with long Nails, to cut deep through the Margins of Authors. Its Ve&s;ture was of the Paper of <HI>Nilus,</HI> bearing in&s;crib'd upon its Brea&s;t in Capital Let|ters, <HI>ZOILUS the HOMERO-MASTIX</HI>; and all the re&s;t of it was &s;crawl'd with various Mon&s;ters of that River, as Emblems of tho&s;e Pro|ductions with which that Critick us'd to fill his Papers. When they had reach'd the Temple, where the King and his Court were already plac'd to behold them from its Galleries, the Image of ZOILUS was hung upon a Gibbet, there erected for it, with &s;uch loud Acclama|tions as witne&s;s'd the Peoples Satisfaction. This being fini&s;h'd, the <HI>Hours</HI> knock'd at the Gates, which flew open, and di&s;cover'd the Statue of HOMER magnificently &s;eated, with the Pictures of tho&s;e Cities which contended for his Birth, rang'd in Order around him. Then they who repre&s;ented the Deities in the Proce&s;&s;ion, laying a&s;ide their En&s;igns of Divinity, u&s;her'd in the Men of Learning with a Sound of Voices, and their
<PB REF="36">
various In&s;truments, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a Sacrifice in Honour of <HI>Apollo</HI> and his Favourite HOMER.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily believ'd, that ZOILUS concluded his Affairs were at the utmo&s;t Point of De&s;peration in <HI>Aegypt</HI>; wherefore, fill'd with Pride, Scorn, Anger, Vexation, Envy, (and what|ever cou'd torment him, except the Knowledge of his Unworthine&s;s) he flung him&s;elf aboard the fir&s;t Ship which left that Country. As it hap|pen'd, the Ve&s;&s;el he &s;ail'd in was bound for <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI> and this landing him at a Port the neare&s;t to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> he was a little pleas'd amid&s;t his Mi|&s;ery to think of decrying HOMER in another Place where he was ador'd, and which chiefly pretended to his Birth. So incorrigible was his Di&s;po&s;ition, that no Experience taught him any Thing which might contribute to his Ea&s;e and Safety.</P>
<P>And as his Experience wrought nothing on him, &s;o neither did the Accidents, which the Opinion of tho&s;e Times took for ominous Warnings: For, he is reported to have &s;een the Night he came to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> a venerable Per&s;on, &s;uch as HOMER is de&s;crib'd by Antiquity, threatning him in a Dream; and in the Morning he found a Part of his Works gnaw'd by <HI>Mice,</HI> which, &s;ays <HI>Aelian,</HI> are of all Bea&s;ts the mo&s;t prophetick; in&s;omuch that they know when to leave a Hou&s;e, even before its Fall is &s;u&s;pected. Envy, which has no Relaxation, &s;till hurry'd him forward, for it is certainly true
<PB REF="37">
that a Man has not firmer Re&s;olution from Rea|&s;on, to &s;tand by a good Principle, than Ob&s;tinacy from perverted Nature, to adhere to a bad one.</P>
<P>In the Morning as he walk'd the Street, he ob&s;erv'd in &s;ome Places In&s;criptions concerning HOMER, which inform'd him where he liv'd, where he had taught School, and &s;everal other Par|ticularitieswhich the <HI>Smyrneans</HI> glory to have recor|ded of him; all which awaken'd and irritated the Pa&s;&s;ions of ZOILUS. But his Temper was quite overthrown, by the venerable Appearance which he &s;aw, upon entring the <HI>Homereum</HI>; which is a Building compos'd of a Library, Porch, and Temple erected to HOMER. Here a Phrenzy &s;eiz'd him which knew no Bounds; he rav'd vi|olently again&s;t the Poet, and all his Admirers; he trampled on his Works, he &s;purn'd about his Commentators, he tore down his Bu&s;ts from the Niches, threw the Medals that were ca&s;t of him out of the Windows, and pa&s;&s;ing from one Place to another, beat the aged Prie&s;ts, and broke down the Altar. The Cries which were occa|&s;ioned by this Means brought in many upon him; who ob&s;erv'd with Horror how the mo&s;t &s;acred Honours of their City were prophan'd by the frantick Impiety of a Stranger; and immediately dragg'd him to Puni&s;hment before their Magi|&s;trates, who were then &s;itting. He was no &s;ooner there, but known for ZOILUS by &s;ome
<PB REF="38">
in Court, a Name a long Time mo&s;t hateful to <HI>Smyrna</HI>; which, as it valu'd it&s;elf upon the Birth of HOMER, &s;o bore more impatiently than other Places, the Abu&s;es offer'd him. This made them eager to propitiate his Shade, and claim to them&s;elves a &s;econd Merit by the Death of ZOILUS; wherefore they &s;entenc'd him to &s;uffer by Fire, as the due Reward of his De&s;ecra|tions; and order'd, that their City &s;hou'd be pu|rify'd by a Lu&s;tration, for having entertain'd &s;o impious a Gue&s;t. In Pur&s;uance to this Sentence, he was led away, with his Compo&s;itions born before him by the publick Executioner: Then was he fa&s;ten'd to the Stake, prophe&s;ying all the while how many &s;hou'd ari&s;e to revenge his Quarrel: particularly, that when <HI>Greek</HI> &s;hou'd be no more a Language, there &s;hall be a <HI>Nation</HI> which will both <HI>tran&s;late</HI> HOMER into <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> and <HI>contract</HI> him in <HI>Ver&s;e.</HI> At la&s;t, his Compo|&s;itions were lighted to &s;et the Pile on Fire, and he expir'd &s;ighing for the Lo&s;s of them, more than for the Pain he &s;uffer'd: And perhaps too, becau&s;e he might fore&s;ee in his prophetick Rapture, that there &s;hou'd ari&s;e a Poet in another Nation, able to do HOMER Ju&s;tice, and make him known among&s;t his People to future Ages.</P>
<P>Thus dy'd this noted Critick, of whom we may ob&s;erve from the Cour&s;e of the Hi&s;tory, that as &s;everal Cities contended for the
<PB REF="39">
Honour of the Birth of HOMER, &s;o &s;everal have contended for the Honour of the Death of ZOILUS. With him likewi&s;e peri&s;h'd his great Work on the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es</HI>; concerning which we ob&s;erve al&s;o, that as the known Worth of HOMER'S Poetry makes him &s;urvive him&s;elf with Glory; &s;o the bare Memory of ZOILUS'S Critici&s;m makes him &s;urvive him&s;elf with Infamy. The&s;e are de&s;ervedly the Con&s;e|quences of that <HI>ill Nature</HI> which made him fond of Detraction, that <HI>Envy,</HI> which made him choo&s;e &s;o excellent a Character for its Object, and tho&s;e <HI>partial Methods</HI> of <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> with which he treated the Object he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Yet how many commence Criticks after him, upon the &s;ame unhappy Principles? How many labour to de&s;troy the Monuments of the dead, and &s;ummon up the Great from their Graves to an&s;wer for Trifles before them? How many, by Mi&s;repre&s;entations, both hinder the World from favouring Men of Genius, and di&s;courage them in them&s;elves; like Boughs of a baneful and bar|ren Nature, that &s;hoot a-cro&s;s a Fruit-Tree; at once to &s;creen the Sun from it, and hinder it by their Droppings from producing any Thing of Value? But if the&s;e who thus follow ZOILUS, meet not the &s;ame Severities of Fate, becau&s;e they come &s;hort of his Indefatigablene&s;s, or their Object is not &s;o uni|ver&s;ally the Concern of Mankind; they &s;hall neverthele&s;s
<PB REF="40">
meet a Proportion of it in the inward Trouble they give them&s;elves, and the outward Contempt others fling upon them: A Puni&s;h|ment which every one has hitherto felt, who has really de&s;erv'd to be call'd a ZOILUS; and which will always be the natural Reward of &s;uch Mens Actions, as long as ZOILUS is the proper Name of <HI>Envy.</HI></P>

<P>_I MUST do my Reader the Ju&s;tice, before I enter upon the&s;e NOTES of ZOILUS, to inform him, that I have not in any Author met this Work a&s;crib'd to him by its Title, which has made me not men|tion it in the LIFE. But thus much in general appears, that he wrote &s;everal Things be&s;ides his Cen&s;ure on the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which, as it gives Ground for this Opinion, encourages me to offer an Account of the Treati&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="93">
Being acquainted with a grave Gentleman who &s;earches after Editions, purcha&s;es Manu&s;cripts, and collects Copies, I apply'd to him for &s;ome Editions of this Poem, which he readily oblig'd me with. But, added he, taking down a Paper, I doubt I &s;hall di&s;courage you from your Tran&s;|lation, when I &s;how this Work, which is written upon the Original, by ZOILUS, the famous Ad|ver&s;ary of HOMER. ZOILUS! &s;aid I with Sur|prize, I thought his Works had long &s;ince peri&s;h'd. They have &s;o, an&s;wer'd he, all, except this little Piece, which has a PREFACE annex'd to it ac|counting for its Pre&s;ervation. It &s;eems, when he parted from <HI>Macedon,</HI> he left this behind him where he lodg'd, and where no one enter'd for a long Time, in Dete&s;tation of the Odiou&s;ne&s;s of his Character, 'till <HI>Maevius</HI> arriving there in his Travels, and being de&s;irous to lie in the &s;ame Room, luckily found it, and brought it away with him. This the Author of the PREFACE imagins the Rea&s;on of <HI>Ho|race</HI>'s wi&s;hing <HI>Maevius</HI> in the 10th <HI>Epode,</HI> &s;uch a Ship|wrack as HOMER de&s;cribes; as it were with an Eye to his having done &s;omething di&s;advan|tageous to that Poet. From <HI>Maevius,</HI> the Piece came into the Hand of <HI>Carbilius Pictor,</HI> (who, when he wrote again&s;t <HI>Virgil,</HI> call'd his Book, with a re&s;pectful Imitation of ZOILUS, the <HI>Aeneidoma&s;tix</HI>) and from him into the Hands of others who are unknown, becau&s;e the World ap|ply'd to them no other Name than that of ZOILUS, in Order to &s;ink their own in
<PB REF="94">
Oblivion. Thus it ever found &s;ome learned Phi|lologi&s;t or Critick, to keep it &s;ecret from the Rage of HOMER's Admirers; yet not &s;o &s;ecret, but that it has &s;till been communicated among the <HI>Literati.</HI> I am of Opinion, that our Great <HI>Scaliger</HI> borrow'd it, to work him up when he writ &s;o &s;harply again&s;t <HI>Cardan</HI>; and perhaps <HI>Le Clerc</HI> too, when he prov'd <HI>Q. Curtius</HI> ignorant of every particular Branch of Learning.</P>
<P>This formal Account made me give Attention to what the Book contain'd; and I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that whether it be his, or the Work of &s;ome Grammarian, it appears to be writ in his Spirit. The open Profe&s;&s;ion of Enmity to great Genius's, and the Fear of nothing &s;o much as that he may not be able to find Faults enough, are &s;uch Re&s;emblances of his &s;tronge&s;t Features, that any one might take it for his own Production. To give the World a Notion of this, I have made a Collection of &s;ome REMARKS, which mo&s;t &s;truck me, during that &s;hort Time in which I was allow'd to peru&s;e the Manu&s;cript.</P>

<HEAD>THE REMARKS OF ZOILUS UPON <HI>Homer'^s Battle</HI> OF THE <HI>FROGS</HI> and <HI>MICE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VERSE I. TO fill my ri&s;ing Song.] <HI>As</HI> Pro|tagoras <HI>the Sophi&s;t found Fault with the Beginning of the</HI> Iliad, <HI>for its &s;peaking to the</HI> Mu&s;e <HI>ra|ther with an abrupt Command, than a &s;olemn Invoca|tion, &s;o I,</HI> &s;ays ZOILUS, <HI>do on the other Hand find Fault with him for u&s;ing any Invocation at all be|fore this Poem, or any &s;uch Trifles as he is Author</HI>
<PB REF="96">
<HI>of. If he mu&s;t a&s;e one,</HI> Protagoras <HI>is in the right; if not, I am: This I hold for true Critici&s;m, not|with&s;tanding the Opinion of</HI> Ari&s;totle <HI>again&s;t us. Nor let any one lay a Stre&s;s on</HI> Ari&s;totle <HI>in this Point; he alas! knows nothing of Poetry but what he has read in</HI> HOMER; <HI>his Rules are all extrac|ted from him, or founded in him. In &s;hort,</HI> HO|MER'S <HI>Works are the Examples of</HI> Ari&s;totle's <HI>Pre|cepts; and</HI> Ari&s;totle's <HI>Precepts the Methods</HI> HO|MER <HI>wrought by.</HI> From hence it is to be con|cluded as the Opinion of this Critick, that who|ever wou'd intirely de&s;troy the Reputation of HOMER, mu&s;t renounce the Authority of <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> before-hand. The Rules of Building may be of Service to us, it we de&s;ign to judge of an Edifice, and di&s;cover what may be ami&s;s in it for the Advantage of future Artificers; but they are of no U&s;e to tho&s;e who only intend to overthrow it utterly.</P>
<P>After the Word [<HI>Song,</HI>] in the fir&s;t Line the Original adds, [<HI>What I have written in my Tablets.</HI>] The&s;e Words, which are dropp'd in the Tran&s;la|tion as of no Con&s;equence, the Great ZOILUS has thought fit to expunge; a&s;&s;erting for a Rea&s;on, without backing it with farther Proof, <HI>That Ta|blets were not of &s;o early Invention.</HI> Now, it mu&s;t be granted, this Manner of <HI>proving by Affirma|tion</HI> is of an extraordinary Nature, but however it has its End with a Set of Readers for whom it is adapted. One Part of the World knows not with what A&s;&s;urance another Part can expre&s;s it&s;elf.
<PB REF="97">
They imagine a rea&s;onable Creature will not have the Face to &s;ay any Thing which has not &s;ome Shadow of Rea&s;on to &s;upport it; and run implicity into the Snare which is laid for good Nature, by the&s;e daring Authors of definitive Sen|tences upon bare A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>VERSE 15. <HI>Whom Cats pur&s;u'd.</HI>] The <HI>Greek</HI> Word here expre&s;ly &s;ignifies a <HI>Cat:</HI> ZOILUS, whom <HI>Peri|zonius</HI> follows, affirms, <HI>It was Weezils which the Mou&s;e fled from</HI>; and then objects again&s;t its Pro|bability. But it is common with one Sort of Criticks, to &s;hew an Author means differently from what he really did, and then to prove, that the Meaning which <HI>they</HI> find out for him is good for nothing.</P>
<P>VERSE 25. <HI>If worthy Friend&s;hip.</HI>] In this Pro|po&s;al begins the Moral of the whole Piece, which is, that ha&s;ty, ill-founded, or unnatural Friend&s;hips and Leagues, will naturally end in War and Di&s;cord. But ZOILUS, who is here mightily concern'd to take off from HO|MER all the Honour of having de&s;ign'd a Mo|ral, a&s;&s;erts on the other Hand, <HI>That the Poet's whole Intent was to make a Fable; that a Fable he has made, and one very idle and triffling; that many Things are a&s;crib'd to</HI> HOMER, <HI>which poor</HI> HOMER <HI>never dream'd of; and he who finds them out ra|ther &s;hews his own Parts than di&s;cover his Author's Beauties.</HI> In this Opinion has he been follow'd by &s;everal of tho&s;e Criticks, who only dip into Authors when they have Occa&s;ion to write again&s;t
<PB REF="98">
them. And yet even the&s;e &s;hall &s;peak differently concerning the De&s;ign of Writers, if the Que&s;tion be of their own Performances; for to their own Works they write <HI>Prefaces,</HI> to di&s;play the Grand|ne&s;s of the Moral, Regularity of the Scheme, Number and Brightne&s;s of the Figures, and a Thou&s;and other Excellencies, which if they did not tell, no one wou'd ever imagine. For others, they write <HI>Remarks,</HI> which tend to con|tract their Excellencies within the narrow Compa&s;s of their partial Apprehen&s;ion. It were well if they cou'd allow &s;uch to be as wi&s;e as them&s;elves, whom the World allows to be much wi&s;er: But their being naturally Friends to them&s;elves, and profe&s;&s;edly Adver&s;aries to &s;ome greater Genius, ea&s;ily accounts for the&s;e different Manners of Speaking. I will not leave this Note, without giving you an In&s;tance of its Practice in the Great <HI>Julius Scaliger:</HI> He has been free enough with HOMER in the <HI>Remarks</HI> he makes upon him; but when he &s;peaks of him&s;elf, I de&s;ire my Reader wou'd take Notice of his Mode&s;ty; I give his own Words, <HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Poet. Cap.</HI> 112. <HI>In Deum Patrem Hymnum cum &s;cribe|remus tanquam rerum omnium conditorem, ab orbis ip&s;ius creatione ad nos no&s;tra&abque; u&s;&abque; duximus.&mdash;In quo abduximus animum no&s;trum a corporis carcere ad liberos campos contemplationis quae me in illum tran&s;|formaret. Tum autem &s;ancti&s;&s;imi Spiritus ineffabilis vigor ille tanto ardore celebratus e&s;t, ut cum leni&s;&s;i|mis numeris e&s;&s;et inchoatus Hymnus, repentino divini Ignis impetu conflagravit.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="99">
VERSE 53. <HI>The circled Loaves.</HI>] ZOILUS <HI>here finds Fault with the Mention of Loaves, Tripes, Bacon and Chee&s;e, as Words below the Dignity of the</HI> Epick, <HI>as much,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>as it wou'd be to have opprobious Names given in it.</HI> By which Expre&s;&s;ion we ea|&s;ily &s;ee, he hints at the Fir&s;t Book of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> Now, we mu&s;t con&s;ider in An&s;wer, that it is a Mou&s;e which is &s;poken of, that Eating is the mo&s;t appearing Characteri&s;tick of that Creature, that the&s;e Foods are &s;uch as plea&s;e it mo&s;t; and to have de&s;crib'd particular Plea&s;ures for it in any other Way, would have been as incongruous, as to have de&s;crib'd a haughty loud Anger without tho&s;e Names which it throws out in its Fierce|ne&s;s, and which rai&s;e it to its Pitch of Phren|zy. In the one In&s;tance you &s;till &s;ee a Mou&s;e before you, however the Poet rai&s;es it to a Man; in the other you &s;hall &s;ee a Man before you; however the Poet rai&s;es him to a Demi-God. But &s;ome call that <HI>low,</HI> which others call <HI>natural.</HI> Every Thing has two Handles, and the Critick who &s;ets him&s;elf to cen&s;ure all he meets, is under an Obli|gation &s;till to lay hold on the wor&s;t of them.</P>
<P>VERSE 75. <HI>But me, nor Stalks.</HI>] In this Place ZOI|LUS <HI>laughs at the Ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of the Poet, who</HI> (ac|cording to his Repre&s;entation) <HI>makes a Prince re|fu&s;e an Invitation in Heroicks, becau&s;e he did not like the Meat he was invited to.</HI> And, that the Ridicule may appear in as &s;trong a Light to others as to him&s;elf, he puts as much of the Speech as concerns it into Burle&s;que Airs and
<PB REF="100">
Expre&s;&s;ions. This is indeed a common Trick with <HI>Remarkers,</HI> which they either practice by Precedent from their Ma&s;ter ZOILUS, or are be|holding for it to the &s;ame Turn of Temper. We acknowledge it a fine Piece of Satyr, when there is Folly in a Pa&s;&s;age, to lay it open in the Way by which it naturally requires to be expos'd: Do this hand&s;omely, and the Author is de&s;ervedly a Je&s;t. If, on the contrary, you dre&s;s a Pa&s;&s;age which was not originally fooli&s;h, in the highe&s;t Humour of Ridicule, you only frame &s;omething which the Author him&s;elf might laugh at, with|out being more nearly concern'd than another Reader.</P>
<P>VERSE 103. <HI>So pa&s;s'd</HI> Europa.] This Simile makes ZOILUS, who &s;ets up for a profe&s;s'd Enemy of Fables, to exclaim violently. <HI>We had,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a Frog and a Mou&s;e hitherto, and now we get a Bull and a Prince&s;s to illu&s;trate their Actions: When will there be an End of this Fabling-Folly and Poetry, which I value my &s;elf for being unacquainted with? O great</HI> Polycrates, <HI>how happily ha&s;t thou ob&s;erv'd in thy Accu&s;ation again&s;t</HI> Socrates, <HI>That whatever he was before, he de&s;erv'd his Poi&s;on when he began to make Ver&s;es!</HI> Now, if the Que&s;tion be con|cerning HOMER'S good or bad Poetry, this is an unqualifying Speech, which affords his Friends ju&s;t Grounds of Exception again&s;t the Critick. Where|fore, be it known to all pre&s;ent and future Cen|&s;ors, who have, or &s;hall pre&s;ume to glory in an Ignorance of Poetry, and at the &s;ame Time take upon them to judge of Poets, that they are in all
<PB REF="101">
their Degrees for ever excluded the Po&s;t they would u&s;urp. In the fir&s;t Place, they who know neither the U&s;e, nor Practice of the Art; in the &s;econd, they who know it but by Halves, who have Hearts in&s;en&s;ible of the Beauties of Poetry, and are however able to find Fault by Rules; and, thirdly, they who, when they are capable of per|ceiving Beauties and pointing out Defects, are &s;till &s;o ignorant in the Nature of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, as to imagine the Province of Critici&s;m extends it&s;elf only on the Side of Di&s;prai&s;e and Reprehen&s;ion. How cou'd any one at this Rate be &s;een with his proper Ballance of Perfection and Error? or what were the be&s;t Performances in this Indul|gence of ill Nature, but as Apartments hung with the Deformities of Humanity, done by &s;ome great Hand, which are the more to be abhorr'd, becau&s;e the Prai&s;e and Honour they receive, re|&s;ults from the Degree of Unea&s;ine&s;s, to which they put every Temper of common Goodne&s;s?</P>
<P>VERSE 130. <HI>Ye Mice, ye Mice.</HI>] The Ancients believ'd that Heroes were turn'd into Demi-Gods at their Death; and in general, that departing Souls have &s;omething of a Sight into Futurity. It is either this Notion, or a Care which the Gods may take to abate the Pride of in&s;ulting Adver&s;aries, which a Poet goes upon, when he makes his Leaders die foretelling the End of tho&s;e by whom they are &s;lain. ZOILUS however is again&s;t this Pa&s;&s;age. He &s;ays, <HI>That every Character ought to be &s;trictly kept; that a General ought not to invade the Cha|racter of a Prophet, nor a Prophet of a General.</HI> He
<PB REF="102">
is po&s;itive, <HI>That nothing &s;hou'd be done by any one, without having been hinted at in &s;ome previous Account of him.</HI> And this he a&s;&s;erts, without any Allowance made either for a Change of States, or the De&s;ign of the Gods. To confirm this Ob|&s;ervation, he &s;trengthens it with a Quotation out of his larger Work on the <HI>Iliads,</HI> where he has the&s;e Words upon the Death of <HI>Hector: How fooli&s;h is it in</HI> HOMER <HI>to make</HI> Hector <HI>(who thro' the whole Cour&s;e of the Iliad had made U&s;e of</HI> Helenus, <HI>to learn the Will of the Gods) become a Prophet ju&s;t at his Death? Let every one be what he ought, without falling into tho&s;e Parts which others are to &s;u&s;tain in a Poem.</HI> This he has &s;aid, not di&s;tingui&s;hing rightly be|tween our natural Di&s;po&s;itions and accidental Offices. And this he has &s;aid again, not mind|ing, that tho' it be taken from another Book, it is &s;till from the &s;ame Author. However, Vanity loves to gratify it&s;elf by the Repetition of what it e&s;teems to be written with Spirit, and even when we repeat it our &s;elves, pro|vided another hears us. Hence has he been fol|low'd by a Magi&s;terial Set of Men who quote them&s;elves, and &s;well their new Performances with what they admire in their former Trea|ti&s;es. This is a mo&s;t extraordinary Knack of Arguing, whereby a Man can never want a Proof, if he be allow'd to become an Authority for his own Opinion.</P>
<P>VERSE 146. <HI>And no kind Billow.</HI>] <HI>How impertinent is this Ca&s;e of Pity,</HI> &s;ays ZOILUS, <HI>to bemoan, that the Prince was not to&s;s'd towards Land: It is enough</HI>
<PB REF="103">
<HI>he lo&s;t his Life, and there is an End of his Suffering where there is an End of his Feeling. To carry the Mat|ter farther is ju&s;t the &s;ame fooli&s;h Management as</HI> HOMER <HI>has &s;hewn in his</HI> Iliads, <HI>which he &s;pins out into forty Triffles beyond the Death of</HI> Hector. But the Critick mu&s;t allow me to put the Rea|ders in Mind, that Death was not the la&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s the Ancients believ'd was to be met upon Earth. The la&s;t was the remaining unbury'd, which had this Mi&s;ery annex'd, that while the Body was without its Funeral-Rites in this World, the Soul was &s;uppos'd to be without Re&s;t in the next, which was the Ca&s;e of the Mou&s;e before us. And accordingly the <HI>Ajax</HI> of <HI>Sophocles</HI> continues after the Death of its Heroe more than an Act, upon the Conte&s;t concerning his Burial. All this ZOILUS knew very well: But ZOILUS is not the only one, who di&s;putes for Victory rather than Truth. The&s;e fooli&s;h Criticks write even Things they them&s;elves can an&s;wer, to &s;hew how much they can write again&s;t an Author. They act unfairly, that they may be &s;ure to be &s;harp enough; and triffle with the Reader, in order to be voluminous. It is needle&s;s to wi&s;h them the Return they de&s;erve: Their Di&s;regard to Candour is no &s;ooner di&s;cover'd, but they are for ever bani&s;h'd from the Eyes of Men of Sen&s;e, and condemn'd to wander from Stall to Stall, for a temporary Refuge from that Oblivion which they can't e&s;cape.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 9. <HI>Our Elde&s;t peri&s;h'd.</HI>] ZOILUS has here taken <HI>the Recapitulation of tho&s;e Misfortunes which</HI>
<PB REF="104">
<HI>happen'd to the Royal Family, as an Impertinence that expatiates from the Subject</HI>; tho' indeed there &s;eems nothing more proper to rai&s;e that Sort of Com|pa&s;&s;ion, which was to inflame his Audience to War. But what appears extreamly plea&s;ant is, that at the &s;ame Time he condemns the Pa&s;&s;age, he &s;hou'd make U&s;e of it as an Oppor|tunity, to fall into <HI>an ample Digre&s;&s;ion on the va|rious Kinds of Mou&s;e-Traps,</HI> and di&s;play that mi|nute Learning which every Critick of his Sort is fond to &s;hew him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of. This they ima|gine is tracing of Knowledge thro' its hidden Veins, and bringing Di&s;coveries to Day-light, which Time had cover'd over. Indefatigable and u&s;ele&s;s Mortals! who value them&s;elves for Know|ledge of no Con&s;equence, and think of gaining Applau&s;e by what the Reader is careful to pa&s;s over unread. What did the Di&s;qui&s;ition &s;ignify formerly, whether <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>'s Son, or his Dog, was the elder? or how can the Account of a Ve|&s;ture, or a Player's Ma&s;que, de&s;erve that any &s;hou'd write the Bulk of a Treati&s;e, or others read it when it is written? A Vanity thus poorly &s;upported, which neither affords Plea&s;ure nor Profit, is the un&s;ub&s;tantial Amu&s;ement of a Dream to our &s;elves, and a provoking Occa&s;ion of our Deri&s;ion to others.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 23. <HI>Quills aptly bound&mdash;Fac'd with the Plunder of a Cat they flay'd.</HI>] This Pa&s;&s;age is &s;omething difficult in the Original, which gave ZOI|LUS the Opportunity of inventing an Expre&s;&s;ion, which his Followers conceitedly u&s;e when any
<PB REF="105">
Thing appears dark to them. <HI>This,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>let</HI> Phoe|bus <HI>explain</HI>; as if what exceeds their Capacity mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity demand Oracular Interpretations, and an Interpo&s;al of the God of Wit and Learning. The Ba&s;is of &s;uch Arrogance is the Opinion they have of that Knowledge they a&s;cribe to them&s;elves. They take Critici&s;m to be beyond every other Part of Learning, becau&s;e it gives Judgment upon Books written in every other Part. They think in Con&s;equence, that every Critick mu&s;t be a greater Genius than any Author whom he cen&s;ures; and therefore if they e&s;teem them|&s;elves Criticks, they &s;et enthron'd Infancy at the Head of Literature. Critici&s;m indeed de&s;erves a noble Elogy, when it is enlarg'd by &s;uch a compre|hen&s;ive Learning as <HI>Ari&s;toile</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> were Ma&s;ters of; when it adorns its Precepts with the con&s;ummate Exactne&s;s of <HI>Quintilian,</HI> or is exalted into the &s;ublime Sentiments of <HI>Longinus.</HI> But let not &s;uch Men tell us they participate in the Glory of the&s;e great Men, and place them&s;elves next to <HI>Phoebus,</HI> who, like ZOILUS, entangle an Author in the Wrangles of Grammarians, or try him with a po&s;itive Air and barren Imagination, by the Set of Rules they have collected out of others.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 37. <HI>Ye Frogs, the Mice.</HI>] At this Speech of the Herald's, which recites the Cau&s;e of the War, ZOILUS is angry with the Author, <HI>for not finding out a Cau&s;e entirely ju&s;t; for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it ap|pears not from his own Fable, that</HI> Phy&s;ignathus <HI>invi|ted the Prince with any malicious Intention to make him away.</HI> To this we an&s;wer, 1&s;t. That it is
<PB REF="106">
not nece&s;&s;ary in relating Facts to make every War have a ju&s;t Beginning. 2dly, This doubtful Cau&s;e agrees better with the Moral, by &s;hew|ing that ill-founded Leagues have Accidents to de&s;troy them, even without the Intention of Par|ties. 3dly, There was all Appearance imagi|nable again&s;t the Frogs; and if we may be al|low'd to retort on our Adver&s;ary the Practice of his Po&s;terity, there is more Humanity in an Ho&s;tility proclaim'd upon the Appearance of In|ju&s;tice done us, than in their Cu&s;tom of at|tacking the Works of others as &s;oon as they come out, purely becau&s;e they are e&s;teem'd to be good. Their Performances, which cou'd derive no Merit from their own Names, are then &s;old upon the Merit of their Antagoni&s;t: And if they are &s;en&s;ible of Fame, or even of Envy, they have the Mortification to remember, how much by this Means they become indebted to tho&s;e they injure.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 57. <HI>Where high the Banks.</HI>] This Project is not put in Practice during the following Battle, by Rea&s;on of the Fury of the Combatants: Yet the Mention of it is not impertinent in this Place, fora&s;much as the probable Face of Succe&s;s which it carries with it tended to animate the Frogs. ZOILUS however cannot be &s;o &s;atisfied; <HI>It were better,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to cut it intirely out; nor wou'd</HI> HOMER <HI>be the wor&s;e if half of him were &s;erv'd in the &s;ame Manner; &s;o,</HI> continues he, <HI>they will find it, whoever in any Country &s;hall hereafter undertake &s;o odd a Task, as that of Tran&s;lating him.</HI>
<PB REF="107">
Thus Envy finds Words to put in the Mouth of Ignorance; and the Time will come, when Igno|rance &s;hall repeat what Envy has pronounced &s;o ra&s;hly.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 77. <HI>And tap'ring Sea-Reed.</HI>] If we here take the Reed for that of our own Growth, it is no Spear to match the long Sort of Needles with which the Mice had arm'd them&s;elves; but the Cane, which is rather intended, has its Splinters &s;tiff and &s;harp, to an&s;wer all the U&s;es of a Spear in Battle. Nor is it here to be lightly pa&s;t over, &s;ince ZOILUS moves a Que&s;tion upon it, that the Poet cou'd not choo&s;e a more proper Wea|pon for the Frogs, than that which they choo&s;e for them&s;elves in a defen&s;ive War they maintain with the Serpents of <HI>Nile. They have this Stra|tagem,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Aelian, to protect them&s;elves; they &s;wim with Pieces of Cane acro&s;s their Mouths, of too great a Length for the Breadth of the Serpents Threats; by which Means they are pre|&s;erv'd from being &s;wallow'd by them.</HI> This is a Quotation &s;o much to the Point, that I ought to have u&s;her'd in my Author with more Pomp to dazzle the Reader. ZOILUS and his Follow|ers, who &s;eldom prai&s;e any Man, are however careful to do it for their own Sakes, if at any Time they get an Author of their Opinion: Tho' indeed it mu&s;t be allow'd, they &s;till have a Draw|back in their Manner of Prai&s;e, and rather choo&s;e to drop the Name of their Man, or darkly hint him in a Periphra&s;is, than to have it appear that they have directly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the perpetuating of any
<PB REF="108">
one's Memory. Thus, if a <HI>Dutch</HI> Critick were to introduce for Example <HI>Martial,</HI> he wou'd, in&s;tead of naming him, &s;ay, <HI>Ingenio&s;us ille Epigrammati|cus Bilbilicus.</HI> Or, if one of our own were to quote from among our&s;elves, he wou'd tell us how it has been remark'd <HI>in the Works of a lear|ned Writer, to whom the World is oblig'd for many excellent Productions,</HI> &amp;c. All which Proceeding is like boa&s;ting of our great Friends, when it is to do our &s;elves an Honour, or the Shift of dre&s;&s;ing up one who might otherwi&s;e be di&s;|regarded, to make him pa&s;s upon the World for a re&s;pon&s;ible Voucher to our own A&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 81. <HI>But now where</HI> Jove'<HI>s.</HI>] At this fine Epi&s;ode, in which the Gods are introduced, ZOILUS has no Patience left him to remark; but runs &s;ome Lines with a long String of &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions as <HI>Triffler, Fabler, Lyar, fooli&s;h, impious,</HI> all which he lavi&s;hly heaps upon the Poet. From this Knack of calling Names, joyn'd with the &s;everal Arts of finding Fault, it is to be &s;u&s;|pected, that our ZOILUS'S might make very able Libellers, and dangerous Men to the Go|vernment, if they did not rather turn them&s;elves to be ridiculous Cen&s;ors: For which Rea&s;on I cannot but reckon the State oblig'd to Men of Wit; and under a Kind of Debt in Grati|tude, when they take off &s;o much Spleen, Tur|bulency, and Ill-nature, as might otherwi&s;e &s;pend it &s;elf to the Detriment of the Publick.</P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 98. <HI>If my Daughter's Mind.</HI>] This Speech, which <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;peaks to <HI>Pallas</HI> with a plea&s;ant
<PB REF="109">
Kind of Air, ZOILUS takes gravely to Pieces; and affirms, <HI>It is below</HI> Jupiter'<HI>s Wi&s;dom, and only agree|able with</HI> HOMER'<HI>S Folly, that he &s;hou'd borrow a Rea&s;on for her a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Mice from their Atten|dance in the Temple, when they waited to prey upon tho&s;e Things which were &s;acred to her.</HI> But the Air of the Speech rendering a grave An|&s;wer unnece&s;&s;ary; I &s;hall only offer ZOILUS an Ob&s;ervation in Return for his. There are upon the Stone that is carv'd for the Apotheo&s;is of HOMER, Figures of Mice by his Foot&s;tool, which, according to <HI>Cuperus,</HI> its Interpreters, &s;ome have taken to &s;ignify this Poem; and others tho&s;e Criticks, who tear or vilify the Works of great Men. Now, if &s;uch can be compar'd to Mice, let the Words of ZOILUS be brought home to him&s;elf and his Followers for their Mortification: <HI>That no one ought to think of meriting in the State of Learning only by deba&s;ing the be&s;t Performances, and as it were preying upon tho&s;e Things which &s;hou'd be &s;acred in it.</HI></P>
<P>BOOK II. VERSE 105. <HI>In vain my Father.</HI>] The Speech of <HI>Pallas</HI> is di&s;lik'd by ZOILUS, <HI>becau&s;e it makes the Godde&s;s carry a Re&s;entment again&s;t &s;uch in|con&s;iderable Creatures</HI>; tho' he ought to e&s;teem them otherwi&s;e when they repre&s;ent the Per&s;ons and Ac|tions of Men, and teach us how the Gods di&s;re|gard tho&s;e in their Adver&s;ities who provoke them in Pro&s;perity. But, if we con&s;ider <HI>Pallas</HI> as the Patrone&s;s of Learning, we may by an allegorical Application of the Mice and Frogs, find in this Speech two Sorts of Enemies to Learning; they
<PB REF="110">
who are maliciou&s;ly mi&s;chievous, as the Mice; and they who are turbulent through O&s;tentation, as the Frogs. The fir&s;t are Enemies to Excellency upon Principle; the &s;econd accidentally by the Error of Self-Love, which does not quarrel with the Excellence it&s;elf, but only with tho&s;e People who get more Prai&s;e than them&s;elves by it. Thus, tho' they have not the &s;ame Perver&s;ne&s;s with the others, they are however drawn into the &s;ame Practices, while they ruin Reputations, le&s;t they &s;hou'd not &s;eem to be learn'd; as &s;ome Women turn Pro&s;titutes, le&s;t they &s;hou'd not be thought hand&s;ome enough to have Admirers.</P>
<P>BOOK III. VERSE 5. <HI>The dreadful Trumpets.</HI>] Upon the reading of this, ZOILUS becomes full of Di&s;cove|ries. He recollects, <HI>that</HI> HOMER <HI>makes his</HI> Greeks <HI>come to Battle with Silence, and his</HI> Trojans <HI>with Shouts,</HI> from whence he di&s;covers, <HI>that he knew nothing of Trumpets.</HI> Again, he &s;ees, <HI>that the</HI> Hor|net <HI>is made a Trumpeter to the Battle,</HI> and hence he di&s;covers, <HI>that the Line mu&s;t not be</HI> HOMER'<HI>S.</HI> Now had he drawn his Con&s;equences fairly, he cou'd only have found by the one, that Trumpets were not in u&s;e at the taking of <HI>Troy</HI>; and by the other, that the Battle of <HI>Frogs</HI> and <HI>Mice</HI> was laid by the Poet for a later Scene of Action than that of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> But the Boa&s;t of Di&s;coveries accom|panies the Affectation of Knowledge; and the Af|fectation of Knowledge is taken up with a De&s;ign to gain a Command over the Opinions of others. It is too heavy a Task for &s;ome Criticks to &s;way our Judgments by rational Inferences; a pompous
<PB REF="111">
Pretence mu&s;t occa&s;ion Admiration, the Eyes of Mankind mu&s;t be ob&s;cur'd by a Glare of Pedantry, that they may con&s;ent to be led blindfold, and permit that an Opinion &s;hou'd be dictated to them without demanding that they may be rea&s;on'd in|to it.</P>
<P>BOOK III. VERSE 24. <HI>Big</HI> Seutlaeus <HI>Tumbling.</HI>] ZOILUS has happen'd to bru&s;h the Du&s;t of &s;ome old Manu&s;cript, in which the Line that kills <HI>Seutlaeus</HI> is wanting. And for this cau&s;e he fixes a general Conclu&s;ion, <HI>that there is no Dependance upon any thing which is handed down for</HI> HOMER'<HI>S, &s;o as to allow it Prai&s;e; &s;ince the different Copies vary among&s;t them|&s;elves.</HI> But is it fair in ZOILUS, or any of his Followers, to oppo&s;e one Copy to a Thou&s;and? and are they impartial who wou'd pa&s;s this upon us for an hone&s;t Ballance of Evidence? When there is &s;uch an Inequality on each Side, is it not more than probable that the Number carry the Au|thor's Sen&s;e in them, and the &s;ingle one its Tran|&s;cribers Errors? It is Folly or Madne&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion to be thus given over to Partiality and Prejudices. Men may flouri&s;h as much as they plea&s;e concerning the Value of a new found Edition, in order to bya&s;s the World to particular Parts of it; but in a Matter ea&s;ily decided by common Sen&s;e, it will &s;till continue of its own Opinion.</P>
<P>BOOK III. VERSE 69. <HI>With</HI> Borbocaetes <HI>fights.</HI>] Through the Grammatical Part of ZOILUS'S Work he frequently rails at HOMER for his Dialects. <HI>The&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he in one place, <HI>the Poet made u&s;e of becau&s;e he could not write pure</HI> Greek; and in another,
<PB REF="112">
<HI>they &s;trangely contributed to his Fame, by making &s;everal Cities who ob&s;erv'd &s;omething of their own in his mix'd Language, contend for his being one of their Natives.</HI> Now &s;ince I have here practis'd a Licen&s;e in Imitation of his, by &s;hort'ning the Word <HI>Borbo|caetes</HI> a whole Syllable, it &s;eems a good Opportuni|ty to &s;peak for him where I defend my&s;elf. Re|member then, that any great Genius who introduces Poetry into a Language, has a Power to poli&s;h it, and of all the Manners of &s;peak|ing then in u&s;e, to &s;ettle that for Poetical which he judges mo&s;t adapted to the Art. Take No|tice too, that HOMER has not only done this for Nece&s;&s;ity but for Ornament, &s;ince he u&s;es various Dialects to humour his Sen&s;e with Sounds which are expre&s;&s;ive of it. Thus much in Behalf of my Author to an&s;wer ZOILUS: As for my&s;elf, who deal with his Followers, I mu&s;t argue from Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, that the Word was &s;tubborn and wou'd not ply to the Quantities of an Engli&s;h Ver&s;e, and therefore I alter'd it by the <HI>Dialect</HI> we call <HI>Poetical,</HI> which makes my Line &s;o much &s;moother, that I am ready to cry with their Brother <HI>Lip&s;ius,</HI> when he turn'd an O into an I, <HI>Vel ego me amo, vel me amavit</HI> Phaebus <HI>quando hoc correxi.</HI> To this let me add a Recrimination upon &s;ome of them: As fir&s;t, &s;uch as choo&s;e Words written after the Manner of tho&s;e who preceded the pure&s;t Age of a Language, without the Nece&s;&s;ity I have pleaded, as <HI>regundi</HI> for <HI>regendi, perduit</HI> for <HI>perdidit,</HI> which Re&s;toration of ob&s;olete Words de&s;erves to be call'd a <HI>Critical Licen&s;e</HI> or <HI>Dialect.</HI> 2<HI>dly,</HI> Tho&s;e who pretending
<PB REF="113">
to Ver&s;e without an Ear, u&s;e the <HI>Poetical Dia|lect</HI> of <HI>Abbreviation,</HI> &s;o that the Lines &s;hall run the rougher for it. And, 3<HI>dly,</HI> Tho&s;e who pre&s;ume by their <HI>Critical Licen&s;es</HI> to alter the Spellings of Words; an Affectation which de|&s;troys the Etymology of a Language, and being carry'd on by private Hands for Fancy or Fa&s;hion, wou'd be a Thing we &s;hou'd never have an End.</P>
<P>BOOK III. VERSE 149. <HI>Nor Pallas, Jove.</HI>] <HI>I cannot,</HI> &s;ays ZOILUS, <HI>reflect upon this Speech of</HI> Mars, <HI>where a</HI> Mou&s;e <HI>is oppos'd to the God of War, the Godde&s;s of Valour, the Thunder of</HI> Jupiter, <HI>and all the Gods at once, but I rejoyce to think that</HI> Pythagoras <HI>&s;aw</HI> HOMER'<HI>S Soul in Hell hanging on a Tree and &s;urrounded with Serpents for what he &s;aid of the Gods.</HI> Thus he who hates Fables an&s;wers one with another, and can rejoyce in them when they flatter his Envy. He appears at the Head of his Squadron of Criticks, in the full Spirit of one ut|terly devoted to a Party; with whom Truth is a Lye, or as bad as a Lye, when it makes again&s;t him; and fal&s;e Quotations, pa&s;s for Truth, or as good as Truth, when they are nece&s;&s;ary to a Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BOOK III. VERSE 203. <HI>And a wholeWar.</HI>] <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays ZOILUS, <HI>is an End of a very fooli&s;h Poem, of which by this Time I have effectually convinc'd the World, and &s;ilenc'd all &s;uch for the future, who, like</HI> HOMER, <HI>write Fables to which others find Morals, Characters who&s;e Ju&s;tne&s;s is que&s;tion'd, un|nece&s;&s;ary Digre&s;&s;ions, and impious Epi&s;odes.</HI> But what A&s;&s;urance can &s;uch as ZOILUS have, that the World will ever be convinc'd again&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;h'd
<PB REF="114">
Reputation, by &s;uch People who&s;e Faults in writing are &s;o very notorious? who judge again&s;t Rules, affirm without Rea&s;ons, and cen&s;ure with|out Manners? who quote them&s;elves for a Sup|port of their Opinions, found their Pride upon a Learning in Trifles, and their Superiority upon the Claims they magi&s;terially make? who write of Beauties in a har&s;h Style, judge of Excellency with a Lowne&s;s of Spirit, and pur&s;ue their De|&s;ire to decry it with every Artifice of Envy? There is no Di&s;grace in being cen&s;ur'd, where there is no Credit to be favour'd. But, on the contrary, Envy gives a Te&s;timony of &s;ome Perfection in another; and one who is attack'd by many, is like a Heroe whom his Enemies acknowledge for &s;uch, when they point all the Spears of a Battle again&s;t him. In &s;hort, an Author who writes for every Age, may even erect him&s;elf a Monument of tho&s;e Stones which Envy throws at him: While the Critick who writes again&s;t him can have no Fame becau&s;e he has no Succe&s;s; or if he fancies he may &s;uc|ceed, he &s;hou'd remember, that by the Nature of his Undertaking he wou'd but undermine his own Foundation; for he is to &s;ink of Cour&s;e when the Book which he writes again&s;t, and for which alone he is read, is lo&s;t in Di&s;repute or Oblivion.</P>
