<HEAD>A VINDICATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_UNDER Pretence of &s;ome A|bu&s;es committed by Mathe|maticians, in Virtue of the Au|thority they derive from their Profe&s;&s;ion, the Author of the <HI>Minute Philo&s;opher,</HI> in a <HI>Libel</HI> called the <HI>Ana|ly&s;t,</HI> has declared 'em Infidels, Makers of Infidels, and Seducers of Mankind in Matters of the highe&s;t Concernment: This he profe&s;&s;es to have done, not from any real Knowlege of his own, but from the credible Information of others; but he has neither produc'd his Informers, nor proved the Accu&s;ation in any one In&s;tance; and therefore it is Defamatory.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
But they a&s;&s;ume an Authority, it &s;eems, in Things foreign to their Profe&s;&s;ion, and un|dertake to decide in Matters whereof their Knowledge can by no Means qualify them to be competent Judges: And as this Prac|tice, if not prevented, may be of dan|gerous Con&s;equence; he has undertaken to enquire into the Object, Principles and Method of Demon&s;tration, admitted by the Mathematicians of the pre&s;ent Age, with the &s;ame Freedom, he &s;ays, they pre|&s;ume to treat the Principles and My&s;te|ries of Religion, to the end, that all Men may &s;ee what Right they have to lead or what Encouragement others have to fol|low them.</P>
<P>And whereas Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has pre|&s;um'd to interpo&s;e in <HI>Prophecies</HI> and <HI>Re|velations,</HI> and to decide in religious Af|fairs, it has been thought proper to begin with his Method of <HI>Fluxions,</HI> and to try what cou'd be done with that Me|thod, with the Inventor him&s;elf, and with his Followers: And what has been done with 'em every intelligent Reader is able to judge.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
If this Writer may be credited, the Ob|jects about which the Method of <HI>Fluxi|ons</HI> is conver&s;ant, are difficult to conceive or imagine di&s;tinctly; the Notions are mo&s;t ab&s;tracted incomprehen&s;ible Meta|phy&s;ics, not to be admitted for the Foun|dations of clear and accurate Science; the Principles are ob&s;cure, repugnant, pre|carious; the Arguments admitted in Proofs, are fallacious, indirect, illogical; and the Inferences and Conclu&s;ions not more ju&s;t, than the Conceptions of the Principles are clear.</P>
<P>How far the Credulous and Injudicious may become infected by this uncommon Way of treating Mathematics and Mathe|maticians, is not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, and there|fore it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;hort Ac|count of the Nature of <HI>Fluxions,</HI> and of the Objects about which the Method is conver&s;ant; and when it &s;hall be made apparent, that this Author has not under|&s;tood the Metaphy&s;ics he wou'd refute; it will not be difficult to defend the Prin|ciples and their Demon&s;trations, from any Imputations of Fallacy or Repugnancy,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
which have yet been pointed at by him or any other Writer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">In the Method of <HI>Fluxions,</HI> Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> con&s;iders mathematical Quantities, not as compo&s;ed of the &s;malle&s;t Parts, but as de&s;cribed or ge|nerated by continual Motion. Lines are de&s;cribed, and by being de&s;cribed are generated, not by an Appo&s;ition of Parts, but by the Motion of Points; Surfaces by the Motion of Lines, So|lids by the Motion of Surfaces, Angles by the Rotation of their Sides, Times by a continual Flux, and &s;o of the re&s;t. And by con&s;idering that Quantities, in|crea&s;ing in equal Times, and generated by increa&s;ing, become greater or le&s;s, according as the Velocity with which they increa&s;e, and are generated, is greater or le&s;s, he found a Method of deter|mining the Quantities them&s;elves from the Velocities of the Motions, or of the Increments, with which they are generated; calling the Velocities of the Motions or of the Increments <HI>Fluxions,</HI> and the Quantities generated <HI>Fluents.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
The momentaneous Increments or De|crements of flowing Quantities, he el&s;e|where calls by the Name of <HI>Moments,</HI> and con&s;iders the Increments as added or affirmative Moments, and the Decrements as &s;ubducted or negative ones: By Mo|ments we may under&s;tand the na&s;cent or evane&s;cent Elements or Principles of finite Magnitudes, but not Particles of any de|terminate Size, or Increments actually generated; for all &s;uch are Quantities them&s;elves, generated of Moments.</P>
<P>The Magnitudes of the momentaneous Increments or Decrements of Quantities are not regarded in the Method of Fluxions, but their fir&s;t or la&s;t Proportions only; that is, the Proportions with which they begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t: The&s;e are not their Proportions immediately before or after they begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t, but the Proportions with which they begin to exi&s;t, or with which they vani&s;h. If the Lines AC and BE are &s;uppo&s;ed to be ge|nerated in the &s;ame Time, by the Mo|tions of the Points A and B, to C and E; and if by continuing the Motions of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
tho&s;e Points to D and F, they generate DC and EF, &s;ynchronal Increments of AC and BE; <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>it is evident that the Points  D and F may flow back in the &s;ame Time to C and E, and by flowing back perpetual|ly le&s;&s;en the Magnitudes of tho&s;e Increments till at la&s;t they vani&s;h together, when the Points D and F come to coincide with C and E: Now the ultimate Ratio of tho&s;e Increments is that Ratio with which they vani&s;h and become nothing; or the Ratio with which they cea&s;e to be: And the fir&s;t Ratio of them is the Ratio with which they begin to exi&s;t, at the very fir&s;t &s;etting out of the Points from C and E towards D and F.</P>
<P>Hence, if the de&s;cribing Points move back to C and E, in the &s;ame Time wherein by moving forward they gene|rated the Increments DC and EF; and in returning have every where the &s;ame Velocities, at certain Di&s;tances from C and E, which they had at tho&s;e Di&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="8">
in going forward; the la&s;t and fir&s;t Ratios of the Increments will be equal, or they will vani&s;h, and become nothing, with the very &s;ame Ratio with which they began to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence likewi&s;e it appears, that to ob|tain the la&s;t Ratio of &s;ynchronal Incre|ments, the Magnitudes of tho&s;e Incre|crements mu&s;t be infinitely dimini&s;h'd. For their la&s;t Ratio is the Ratio with which they vani&s;h or become nothing: But they cannot vani&s;h or become nothing, by a con&s;tant Diminution, till they are infinite|ly dimini&s;h'd; for without an infinite Diminution they mu&s;t have finite or a&s;|&s;ignable Magnitudes, and while they have finite or a&s;&s;ignable Magnitudes they cannot vani&s;h.</P>
<P>The ultimate Ratios with which &s;yn|chronal Increments of Quantities vani&s;h, are not the Ratios of finite Increments, but Limits which the Ratios of tho&s;e In|crements attain, by having their Magni|tudes infinitely dimini&s;h'd: The Proporti|ons of Quantities which grow le&s;s and
<PB N="10" REF="9">
le&s;s by Motion, and at la&s;t cea&s;e to be, will continually change, and become dif|ferent in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Diminution of the Quantities them&s;elves: And there are certain determinate Limits to which all &s;uch Proportions perpetually tend, and approach nearer than by any a&s;&s;ignable Difference, but never attain before the Quantities them&s;elves are infinitely di|mini&s;h'd; or till the in&s;tant they evane&s;ce and become nothing. The&s;e Limits are the la&s;t Ratios with which &s;uch Quan|tities or their Increments vani&s;h or cea&s;e to exi&s;t; and they are the fir&s;t Ratios with which Quantities or the Increments of Quantities, begin to ari&s;e or come into being.</P>
<P>Quantities, and the Ratios of Quanti|ties, which con&s;tantly tend to an Equali|ty, by a Diminution of their Difference, and before the End of &s;ome finite Time approach nearer to an Equality than by any a&s;&s;ignable Difference, at la&s;t become equal. For they become equal when the Difference between them vani&s;hes or becomes nothing; and it will
<PB N="11" REF="10">
vani&s;h or become nothing by being in|finitely dimini&s;hed: If the Quantities AC and AD perpetually tend to an Equality, either by the Motion of the Point D to C, or by that of C to D; they will be|come equal, and their Ratio a Ratio of Equality, when their Difference CD, by a con&s;tant Diminution, vani&s;hes and be|comes nothing, which it will do under a Coincidence of the two Points in C or D; and then either AD becomes AC, and &s;o AD / AC or AC / AC is a Ratio of Equa|lity, or el&s;e AC becomes AD and AD / AC becomes AD / AD; which is al&s;o a Ratio of Equality.</P>
<P><HI>The Fluxions of Quantities are very nearly as the Increments of their Fluents generated in the lea&s;t equal Particles of Time:</HI> If CD and EF be Increments of the Fluents AC and BE, de&s;cribed in the lea&s;t equal Particles of Time; the Fluxions in the Points C and E will be nearly as the Increments DC and EF. For from the exceeding Smallne&s;s of the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Times it is evident that the Points D and F, mu&s;t be extreamly near to C and E; and by Con&s;equence however the Velo|cities are accelerated or retarded thro' the Spaces CD and EF, they will be very nearly the &s;ame in D and F as they were in C and E: But Velocities which are ve|ry nearly uniform, will be very nearly proportional to the Spaces de&s;cribed by them in equal Times; and therefore the Velocities in the Points C and E, which are the Fluxions of AC and BE in tho&s;e Points, will be very nearly as the Incre|ments DC and EF, de&s;cribed in the lea&s;t equal Particles of Time.</P>
<P><HI>The Fluxions of Quantities are accu|rately in the fir&s;t or la&s;t Proportions of their na&s;cent or evane&s;cent Increments:</HI> Thus the Fluxions of AC and BE, in the Points C and E, are in the fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratio of the Increments CD and EF. For the fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratio of the Incre|ments CD and EF, is the Ratio with which they begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t: But the Ratio with which they begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t, is the &s;ame with the Ratio of the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Velocities in C and E, which are the Fluxions in tho&s;e Points; and con&s;equent|ly the Fluxions in C and E are in the fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratio of the Increments CD and EF.</P>
<P>The Fluxions of Quantities are only the Velocities with which tho&s;e Quanti|ties begin to be generated or increa&s;ed; or the Velocities with which the gene|rating Quantities begin to &s;et out; not the Velocities they have after moving thro' Spaces of any finite or a&s;&s;ignable Mag|nitudes: And therefore if two mathema|tical Quantities &s;et out together, and be|gin to move with Velocities which are as <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> they mu&s;t begin to de&s;cribe Spaces in the &s;ame Proportion with <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>; or the Proportion with which the Spaces begin to exi&s;t or to be de&s;cribed, mu&s;t be the &s;ame with that which the Velocities have at the very Beginning of the Motion. For in the very Beginning of the Motion there is neither any Change of Velocity from Acceleration or Retar|dation, nor Difference of Time.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Hence it appears that to obtain the Ratios of Fluxions, the corre&s;ponding &s;ynchronal or i&s;ochronal Increments mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened <HI>in infinitum.</HI> For the Mag|nitudes of &s;ynchronal or i&s;ochronal In|crements mu&s;t be infinitely dimini&s;hed and become evane&s;cent, in order to obtain their fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios, to which Ratios the Ratios of their corre&s;ponding Fluxions are equal.</P>
<P>Hence likewi&s;e it appears that the Mo|ments of like Quantities, compared with each other, are in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities, taken when fir&s;t they begin to move, and of the Velocities with which they &s;et out: Or in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities when fir&s;t they begin to move, and of the fir&s;t Ratios of their &s;ynchronal na&s;cent Incre|ments. The Moments of Lines there|fore are as the generating Points and as the Velocities with which they begin to move taken together: The Moments of Surfaces, which become greater or le&s;s by carrying of moveable Lines along im|moveable
<PB N="15" REF="14">
ones, are in Ratios compound|ed of the Ratios of the moving Lines, and of their fir&s;t Velocities, or fir&s;t Ra|tios of the Increments which begin to ri&s;e with tho&s;e Velocities: And the whole Motion by which Squares or Rectangles begin to alter, either from an Augmenta|tion or Diminution of their Sides, is the Sum of the na&s;cent Motions of tho&s;e Sides, or the Sum of the na&s;cent Incre|ments ari&s;ing with the fir&s;t Motions of the Sides: For the Proportion of na&s;cent Increments is the &s;ame with that of the Motions with which they begin to be generated.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort Account of the Na|ture of Fluxions, compared with the <HI>Ana|ly&s;t,</HI> it appears that the Author of that Paper is greatly mi&s;taken in the Object of 'em; and he is al&s;o mi&s;taken in the Principles: For he thinks the Moment or Fluxion of a Rectangle, contain'd un|der two indeterminate Quantities A and B, from whence are deduc'd Rules for obtaining the Moments or Fluxions of all other Products or Powers whatever, is
<PB N="16" REF="15">
no where truly determin'd by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton:</HI> But he ought to have read Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> with more Care and Attention than he &s;eems to have done, before he &s;et up to decide and dictate in Matters of this Nature; and he wou'd do well yet to read him with Attention.</P>
<P>If any Rectangle CK be increa&s;ed from an Augmentation of its Sides by Motion, &s;o as that DK becomes LG in the &s;ame Time that DC becomes EG; the Moment of that Rectangle is the Sum of the Rectangles of DK into the Mo|ment of DC, and of DC into the Mo|ment of DK: That is, putting A and B for the Sides DK and DC, and <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for their re&s;pective Moments, the Mo|ment of the Rectangle AB will be A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>For the Gnomon CGK in the In&s;tant it begins or cea&s;es to exi&s;t is the Mo|ment of the Rectangle CK: But the fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratio of that Gnomon to the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC is a Ratio of Equality: For the Difference
<PB N="17" REF="16">
between the Gnomon and the Sum of tho&s;e Rectangles perpetually le&s;&s;ens, by a con&s;tant Diminution of the Increments FD and DH, or by an Ap|proach of the Points F and H towards D; <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>as will be manife&s;t on taking the Ratio between the &s;aid Gnomon and the Sum of the Rectangles, at &s;everal Di&s;tances of the Points F and H from D: For what|ever be the Magnitudes of <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> when F and H fir&s;t begin to move back to|wards D, the Gnomon CGK and Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC, will be as A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>ba</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI>; when tho&s;e Points, by moving towards D, have le&s;&s;en'd the Increments of DK and DC to &frac12;<HI>a</HI> and &frac12;<HI>b,</HI> the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles will be as A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> &plus; &frac12;<HI>ba</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI>; when they have le&s;&s;en'd the Increments to &frac14;<HI>a</HI> and &frac14;<HI>b,</HI> the Gno|mon and Sum of the Rectangles will be
<PB N="18" REF="17">
as A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> &plus; &frac14;<HI>ab</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI>; and as A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> &plus; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>ab</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a,</HI> when they have le&s;&s;en'd tho&s;e Increments to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>a</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>b</HI>: Hence it appears, that un|der a con&s;tant Diminution of the Incre|ments <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> by the Motion of the Points F and H towards D, the Gnomon CGK and the Sum of the Rectangles CF and DL, con&s;tantly tend to an Equali|ty by a continual Diminution of their Difference FH, and that they become equal, and their Ratio becomes a Ratio of Equality, in the In&s;tant that Difference vani&s;hes and the Points F and H coincide with D; or in other Words the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC be|gin or cea&s;e to <HI>be</HI> under a Ratio of Equali|ty: And therefore the Sum of tho&s;e Rect|angles, or A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a,</HI> is the Moment of AB.</P>
<P>Hence, the Gnomon CGK, or A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>ab,</HI> found by taking the Difference between the Rectangles EL and CK, or by deducting the Rectangle AB from a Rectangle contain'd under the Sides A and B increa&s;ed by their whole Incre|ments, is not the Moment or Fluxion
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of the Rectangle AB, except in the ve|ry In&s;tant when it begins or cea&s;es to exi&s;t: And this will al&s;o appear by con|&s;idering it in another Light. For the Moment of the Rectangle CK, or the Motion with which it fir&s;t begins to al|ter, either by increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing, is the Sum of the na&s;cent Motions of its Sides; and the na&s;cent Motions of its Sides, are mea&s;ur'd by their re&s;pec|tive Magnitudes in the very In&s;tant they fir&s;t begin to change, and by the Velo|cities with which they begin to move taken together; and the Velocities with which the Sides begin to move being in the fir&s;t Ratio of the momentaneous Spaces which ari&s;e with 'em; it follows that the Sum of the na&s;cent Motions of the Sides, is the Sum of DK multiply'd into DH in its na&s;cent State, and of CD multiply'd into DF in its na&s;cent State: But DH and DF in their na&s;cent States, are the Moments of DC and DK: And therefore the whole Moment of the Rectangle AB, is A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
In determining the Moments of Quan|tities, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> expre&s;ly tells us, that we are only to con&s;ider: the Ratios with which they begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t; and to obtain tho&s;e Ratios, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the in&s;ochronal In|crements &s;hou'd have finite Magnitudes. <Q REND="inline">Cave tamen intellexeris particulas finitas, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Particulae finitae non &s;unt Momenta, &s;ed Quantitates ip&s;ae ex Momentis genitae.

<P>From the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages it appears, that the Gnomon CGK in its na&s;cent or evane&s;cent State only, or in the In&s;tant it begins or cea&s;es to exi&s;t, is the Moment or Fluxion of the Rectangle CK; and in a na&s;cent or evane&s;cent State, when on|ly the Increments of Quantities become their Moments, its Ratio to A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a,</HI> which is the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC, is a Ratio of Equality. By di|mini&s;hing the Magnitudes of <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> which are Increments of DK and DC, it is obvious that the Gnomon CGK di|mini&s;hes fa&s;ter in Proportion, than the Sum of the Rectangles FC and DL does; and by dimini&s;hing fa&s;ter, it continually approaches to an Equality with that Sum, and attains the Equality only, when their Difference FH becomes evane&s;cent, that is, when the Points F and H come to coincide with D; &s;o that here is no Ar|tifice or fal&s;e Rea&s;oning u&s;ed, to get rid of HF, or <HI>ab,</HI> that Term having no
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Exi&s;tence at the very Beginning of the Motion, or in the na&s;cent State of the Augments.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> had &s;o expre&s;ly told us what he meant by Moments and Fluxions, and by na&s;cent or evane&s;cent Quantities, one wou'd imagine it impo&s;|&s;ible to have mi&s;taken and mi&s;repre&s;ented him in the Manner this Author has done. He &s;eems indeed to have been lead, or rather to have been deceived, by an Opi|nion that there can be no fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios of mathematical Quantities or of their i&s;ochronal Increments generated or de&s;troy'd by Motion; imagining that no &s;uch Quantities, by any Divi&s;ion or Di|minution whatever, can be exhau&s;ted or reduc'd to nothing: But if Lines, Sur|faces and Solids can be generated or aug|mented by the Motion of Points, Lines, and Surfaces, they may likewi&s;e be de|&s;troy'd or dimini&s;h'd by the Motion of the &s;ame Points, Lines and Surfaces, in returning to the Places from whence they fir&s;t &s;et out. While a generating Quantity moves back thro' the &s;ame

Space it before de&s;cribed in moving for|ward, the Quantity generated, or its Augment, continually le&s;&s;ens; and by per&s;evering in a State of decrea&s;ing, it mu&s;t in &s;ome finite Time vani&s;h and be|come nothing; and therefore mathema|tical Quantities, by a con&s;tant Diminu|tion, may be reduc'd to nothing: And &s;uch as are thus generated or de&s;troy'd in equal Times by Motion, or which a|ri&s;e and vani&s;h together, will ari&s;e or va|ni&s;h under certain Ratios, which are their fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios; or the Ratios with which they begin or cea&s;e to be: But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ue this Ca&s;e a little farther, and &s;ee whether Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Demon&s;tration of it cannot be defended, and proved to be geometrical.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Suppo&s;e any Rectangle AB aug|mented by continual Motion; and the momentaneous Increments of its Sides A and B to be denoted by <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>; the Moment of the generated Rect|angle will be mea&s;ured by A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a.</HI></Q></P>

<P>Now, in determining the Moment of a Rectangle, there is nothing to be con|&s;idered, when it fir&s;t begins to be aug|mented by the Motions of its Sides, but the Sides them&s;elves and the Velocities with which they begin to move; or the Sides and the fir&s;t Ratio of the Spaces de&s;cribed by them. And therefore the true Moment of the Rectangle AB, or the Law according to which it begins to be augmented, on the Principles of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> will only be the Sum of
<PB N="25" REF="24">
the Rectangles A<HI>b</HI> and B<HI>a</HI>; for the Sides A and B begin to move with Ve|locities which are as <HI>b</HI> and <HI>a</HI>: But this Moment A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a,</HI> is manife&s;tly equal to the Difference between the Rectangles <GAP DESC="math"> and <GAP DESC="math">; and therefore Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s determination of it is geometrical.</P>
<P>From the foregoing Principle &s;o de|mon&s;trated, the general Rule for finding the Moment or Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity, is ea&s;ily deduc'd: It is ea&s;y, from hence, to infer that the Moment or Fluxion of A<HI>^n</HI> is as <HI>n</HI>A<HI>^n</HI>^&minus;^1, or that the Fluxion of <HI>x^n</HI> is as <HI>nx^n</HI>^&minus;^1: But becau&s;e this is al&s;o determined in a manner &s;eemingly different, by Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> in his Introduction to the <HI>Quadrature of Curves,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> ob|&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">That there &s;eems to have been &s;ome inward Scruple or Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Defect in the foregoing Demon|&s;tration.</Q> And he repeats the &s;ame Reflection in another Place, adding with|al, <Q REND="inline">That Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was not enough plea&s;ed with any one Notion &s;teadily

<P>The Proof given in the Introduction to the <HI>Quadratures,</HI> is &s;aid to be a mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent way of arguing; as pro|ceeding to a certain Point of the Demon|&s;tration upon Suppo&s;ition of an Incre|ment, and then in a fallacious Manner, &s;hifting the Suppo&s;ition to that of no In|crement; and to &s;hew the Incon&s;i&s;teny with greater Force, a Lemma is pre|mi&s;ed by Way of Axiom; as if &s;ome ve|ry obvious and natural Application of an apparent Truth, wou'd at once over|turn the Whole of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Demon|&s;tration: But that Lemma, however true in it &s;elf, is no Way pertinent to the Ca&s;e for which it was intended; and
<PB N="27" REF="26">
therefore &s;uch Inferences as are made in Virtue of it, with relation to the Point in di&s;pute, are illegitimate, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rules of true rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Nothing is more plain and obvious, than that Quantities which begin to exi&s;t together under certain Proportions, and with certain Velocities; may become evane&s;cent and cea&s;e to exi&s;t, under the &s;ame Proportions and with the &s;ame Velo|cities; and this is all Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> &s;uppo&s;es in that Determination of the Fluxion of <HI>x^n</HI>; and it is not very obvious, that the Lemma which this Author has hit upon, is ap|plicable to Ca&s;es of &s;uch a Nature.</P>
<P>That the Reader may &s;ee how &s;trict|ly Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has kept to the &s;ame Principle in this Determination, how &s;teadily he adheres to the &s;ame Method, and how ill the Author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> has proved his Imputations; it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to per&s;ue this Point, and con&s;i|der the Proof it &s;elf.</P>

<P>The Author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> therefore, is greatly mi&s;taken, in thinking Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> found the Fluxion of <HI>x^n,</HI> by a Method different from that he u&s;ed in finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle, con|tain'd under two flowing Quantities: He &s;teadily adheres to one and the &s;ame Method; namely, that of taking the fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios of Quantities, or of their i&s;ochronal Increments, for the Mea|&s;ures of the Ratios of their Fluxions; and u&s;es no illegitimate Artifice to ob|tain the&s;e fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratios; unle&s;s it be accounted illegitimate to &s;uppo&s;e that mathematical Quantities can be gene|rated and de&s;troyed by Motion.</P>
<P>It is pretended, <Q REND="inline">That the Method for finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle of two flowing Quantities, as it is &s;et forth in the <HI>Treati&s;e of Quadra|tures,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="33">
differs from that found in the <HI>&s;econd Book of the Principles,</HI> and is in Effect the &s;ame with that u&s;ed in the <HI>Calculus differentialis:</HI> For the &s;uppo&s;ing a Quantity infinitely di|mini&s;h'd and therefore rejecting it, is in Effect the rejecting an Infinite&s;i|mal.</Q> But if this Author deduces the Rule from the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition in the <HI>Treati&s;e of Quadratures,</HI> and con&s;iders it ever &s;o little, he will find it the very &s;ame with that &s;et down in the <HI>&s;econd Book of the Principles:</HI> And it is doubt|le&s;s in Effect too the &s;ame with that u&s;ed in the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> &s;o far as dif|ferent Methods <HI>can</HI> effect the &s;ame Thing, but no farther: For Quantities are not rejected in the Method of Fluxions, as in the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> on Ac|count of their exceeding Smallne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">But according to the received Prin|ciples it is evident, &s;ays he, that no geometrical Quantity, by being infi|nitely dimini&s;h'd can ever be exhau&s;t|ed or become nothing.</Q> Now, on the received Principles of Fluxions, this is
<PB N="35" REF="34">
a direct Ab&s;urdity. For the&s;e Principles &s;uppo&s;e that mathematical Quantities can be generated by Motion, which he has not yet thought proper to contradict; and con&s;equently they may al&s;o by Mo|tion be de&s;troy'd: For Quantities, and the Augments of Quantities, which in &s;ome finite Time are produc'd by Mo|tion, may perpetually grow le&s;s and le&s;s by reverting that Motion; and by con|&s;tantly growing le&s;s and le&s;s, they may come to be infinitely dimini&s;hed, or to be le&s;s than any a&s;&s;ignable Quantities; and from being le&s;s than any a&s;&s;ignable Quantities, the Motion &s;till per&s;evering, they mu&s;t at la&s;t vani&s;h and become no|thing; otherwi&s;e it might be contended that a Body &s;etting out from any Place, and, in any finite Time, de&s;cribing a cer|tain length, cou'd never by moving back and returning in the &s;ame Line, arrive at the Place from whence it fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then it appears, that the Method of Fluxions, as de&s;crib'd by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> in his Introduction to the <HI>Quadrature of Curves,</HI> and in the
<PB N="36" REF="35">
<HI>&s;econd Book of his mathematical Prin|ciples,</HI> is not that wretched un-&s;cientifi|cal Knack &s;et forth in the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI>; but a Method founded upon obvious, rational, accurate and demon&s;trative Principles: It likewi&s;e appears, that the Conclu&s;ions do not ari&s;e from illegitimate tentative Ways or Inductions, but follow from &s;uch Premi&s;es, and by &s;uch Arguments, as are mo&s;t conformable to the Rules of Logic and right Rea&s;on: All the Skill and Dexterity therefore by this Author &s;hewn, in the Inve&s;tigation of contrary Errors correcting each other, are vain and impertinent. He has mi&s;taken the Doctrine of Fluxions, and by not right|ly di&s;tingui&s;hing its Principles from tho&s;e of the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> has impo&s;ed a fal&s;e Mea&s;ure of Moments upon his Readers, and arguing from that fal&s;e Mea|&s;ure, has unju&s;tly charg'd Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> with Errors ari&s;ing from it; and, to mend the Matter, has in&s;tituted Computations to &s;hew how tho&s;e Errors redre&s;s one ano|ther, and how Mathematicians by Means of Errors bring forth Truth and Science.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">
The Di&s;pute between the Followers of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> is not about the Principles of the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> but about tho&s;e of Fluxions; and it is whether the&s;e Principles in them&s;elves are clear or ob|&s;cure, and whether the Inferences from them are ju&s;t or unju&s;t, true or fal&s;e|&s;cientific or otherwi&s;e: We are not con|cerned about Infinite&s;imals or minute Dif|ferences, but about the Ratios with which mathematical Quantities begin or cea&s;e to exi&s;t by Motion; and to con&s;ider the fir&s;t or la&s;t Proportions of Quantities does not imply that &s;uch Quantities have any fi|nite Magnitudes: They are not the Pro|portions of fir&s;t or la&s;t Quantities, but Li|mits of Ratios; which Limits, the Ratios of Quantities attain <HI>only</HI> by an infinite Diminution of their Magnitudes, by which infinite Diminution of their Mag|nitudes they become evane&s;cent and cea&s;e to exi&s;t.
