<P>THE following PROLOGUE was Spoken to the Dramatic Pa&s;toral, call|ed the <HI>Winter</HI>'s <HI>Tale,</HI> and this Comedy; both of which are altered from <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and were perform'd the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P>Some of the Lines of the PROLOGUE are only relative to the <HI>Winter's Tale,</HI> yet as the Publication of that Pa&s;toral is defer'd for &s;ome Time, and as the PROLOGUE has been particularly de&s;ir'd, it is hop'd that it will not be di&s;agreeable to the Reader to &s;ee it prefix'd to this Comedy.</P>

<L>Thy Husband is thy Lord, thy Life, thy Keeper,</L>
<L>Thy Head, thy Sovereign; one that cares for thee,</L>
<L>And for thy Maintainance: Commits his Body</L>
<L>To painful Labour, both by Sea and Land,</L>
<L>To watch the Night in Storms, the Day in Cold,</L>
<L>While thou ly'&s;t warm at home, &s;ecure and &s;afe;</L>
<L>And craves no other Tribute at thy Hands,</L>
<L>But Love, fair Looks, and true Obedience;</L>
<L>Too little Payment for &s;o great a Debt.</L>

<L>Then, my now gentle <HI>Cath'rine,</HI></L>
<L>Go home with me along, and I will add</L>
<L>Another Dowry to another Daughter,</L>
<L>For thou art changed as thou had&s;t never been.</L>

<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Fortune is &s;ufficient. Here's my Wealth:</L>
<L>Ki&s;s me, my <HI>Kate</HI>; and &s;ince thou art become</L>
<L>So prudent, kind, and dutiful a Wife,</L>
<L><HI>Petruchio</HI> here &s;hall doff the lordly Husband;</L>
<L>An hone&s;t Mask, which I throw off with Plea&s;ure.</L>
<L>Far hence all Rudene&s;s, Wilfulne&s;s, and Noi&s;e,</L>
<L>And be our future Lives one gentle Stream</L>
<L>Of mutual Love, Compliance and Regard.</L>

<L>Nay, then I'm all unworthy of thy Love,</L>

<L>Good <HI>Kate,</HI> no more&mdash;this is beyond my Hopes&mdash;</L>
<STAGE>[Goes forward with <HI>Catharine</HI> in his Hand.</STAGE>
<L>Such Duty as the Subject owes the Prince,</L>
<L>Even &s;uch a Woman oweth to her Husband:</L>
<L>And when &s;he's froward, peevi&s;h, &s;ullen, &s;ower,</L>
<L>And not obedient to his hone&s;t Will;</L>
<L>What is &s;he but a foul contending Rebel,</L>
<L>And gracele&s;s Traitor to her loving Lord?</L>
<L>How &s;hameful 'tis when Women are &s;o &s;imple</L>
<L>To offer War where they &s;hould kneel for Peace;</L>
<L>Or &s;eek for Rule, Supremacy and Sway,</L>
<L>Where bound to love, to honour and obey.</L>
