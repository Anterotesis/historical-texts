<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE &s;eems to have decreed, that not only the minor branches of families, when they arrive at a proper age of maturity, &s;hall &s;ep|arate from their parents, and become di&s;tinct fam|ilies; but that Colonies, when they arrive at a certain degree of population and affluence, &s;hall &s;eparate from the mother State, and become in|dependent and &s;overeign. How&s;oever fit and proper this economy of nature may be, experience has taught the world, that it has been the mi&s;taken policy of nations, in almo&s;t all ages, to oppo&s;e &s;uch &s;eparations, as the period approximates, by an im|politic exerci&s;e of power, thereby alienating the affections of the Coloni&s;ts, and rou&s;ing in their brea&s;ts tho&s;e innate principles of liberty which na|ture hath implanted; (but which, had they not been awakened by a &s;everity of conduct, would have much longer repo&s;ed on the bo&s;om of a mother, and even have &s;purned the idea of &s;eparation) and have al&s;o made u&s;e of armed force, in the mo&s;t un|natural and cruel manner, to hold in &s;ubjection tho&s;e by nature in every re&s;pect free as them&s;elves. And in the pro&s;ecution of a war thus enkindled, alliances are &s;ought for, and formed, by both par|ties, even with tho&s;e who before were con&s;idered as the enemies of each. This has been exemplifi|ed in the conduct of Great-Britain towards her American Colonies, and by the people of the now United States of America, in their &s;truggle for freedom, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of independence and &s;overeignty.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4">
IT is not the intention of the writer to go into a detail of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, or the vici&s;&s;itudes which have attended it, at different pe|riods; nor of the ri&s;e of the late revolution; as the&s;e have already been attempted by &s;everal writ|ers, and probably will hereafter be further elu|cidated by other pens.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve and perpetuate a <HI>daily Journal of occurrences,</HI> through nearly the whole of the late American war, is the pre&s;ent object. And al|though the following pages are not decorated with the flowers of Greece or Rome, and for their dic|tion cannot claim the patronage of the learned, they contain a &s;tate of facts in detail, which may not be unplea&s;ing to po&s;terity, who will wi&s;h, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, to learn from every remaining ve&s;tige, the conduct and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their ance&s;|tors, in that revolution which laid the foundation of the independence and &s;overeignty of their coun|try. To them, therefore, are the following Me|moirs bequeathed, by him who was an eye-wit|ne&s;s to many of the facts which are related, and who collected the others from the be&s;t information the then moment and circum&s;tances would admit.</P>
<P>THAT the United States of America, by their virtue, their wi&s;dom and their valour, may &s;up|port and maintain the noble achievements of their ance&s;tors, and render them &s;till more brilliant, is the earne&s;t wi&s;h of their devoted,</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_MAJOR-GENERAL <HI>WILLIAM HEATH</HI> de&s;cended from an ancient family in Roxbury, near Bo&s;ton, in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, and is of the fifth generation of the family who have inherited the &s;ame real e&s;tae, (taken up in a &s;tate of na|ture) not large, but fertile, and plea&s;antly &s;ituated. He was born March 2d, (old &s;tile) 1737, was brought up a farmer, of which profe&s;&s;ion he is yet pa&s;&s;ionately fond. He is of middling &s;tature, light complexion, very corpulent, and bald-headed, which led the French officers who &s;erved in America, very fre|quently to compare him to the Marquis of Granby. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cha&s;tellux's Travels.</NOTE> From his childhood he was remarkably fond of military exerci&s;es, which pa&s;&s;ion grew up with him, and as he arrived at years of maturity, led him to procure, and attentively to &s;tudy, every military treati&s;e in the Engli&s;h language, which was obtain|able. This, with a &s;trong memory, rendered him fully acquainted with the <HI>theory</HI> of war in all its branches and duties, from the private &s;oldier, to the Commander in Chief.</P>
<P>Through the inactive &s;tate of the militia company to which he belonged, in the &s;pring of the year
<PB N="8" REF="6">
1765, he went over to Bo&s;ton, and entered a mem|ber of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Com|pany. This immediately recommended him to the notice of the Colonel of the fir&s;t regiment of mili|tia in the county of Suffolk, who &s;ent for him, and importuned him to take the command of his own company; to which Mr. Heath was reluctant; ap|prehen&s;ive that his youth, and &s;tepping over tho&s;e who had a better claim, by former office in the com|pany, to the command of it, might produce an un|ea&s;ine&s;s. He was, however, commi&s;&s;ioned by Gov. Barnard; and his apprehen&s;ions of unea&s;ine&s;s proved to be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>In the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, he was cho&s;en, and &s;erved, fir&s;t as Lieutenant, and afterwards as Captain.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t regiment of the militia of Suffolk, he became the military favourite of Gov. Barnard, who publickly declared, that he would not only make him Colonel of the regiment, but, if it were in his power, a General Officer al&s;o.</P>
<P>As the di&s;pute between Great-Britain and her American Colonies put on a more &s;erious a&s;pect, our Captain did not he&s;itate, for a moment, to de|clare his &s;entiments in favour of the rights and liber|ties of his fellow-countrymen. This alarmed Gov. Barnard's apprehen&s;ions, but did not alter his open conduct towards our Captain; though he pri|vately intimated, that if he &s;hould promote him, he might injure the cau&s;e of his royal ma&s;ter. It was afterwards intimated to our Captain, that if he was not advanced to the command of the regiment, he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that his feelings would never (during Gov. Barnard's admini&s;tration) be hurt by any other officer being promoted over him; which was verified; Gov. Barnard leaving the province with this regiment unorganized.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7">
Capt. Heath, convinced that the cloud was rapidly gathering, and would a&s;&s;uredly bur&s;t over America, in the beginning of the year 1770, com|menced his addre&s;&s;es to the public, under the &s;igna|ture of <HI>A Military Countryman,</HI> and which were oc|ca&s;ionally continued until ho&s;tilities commenced. In them he urged the importance of military di&s;cipline, and &s;kill in the u&s;e of arms, as the only means, un|der Heaven, that could &s;ave the country from fall|ing a prey to any daring invader.</P>
<P>Gov. Hutchin&s;on &s;ucceeded Gov. Barnard. He organized the fir&s;t regiment in Suffolk; and, as might be expected, our Captain had a re&s;pite from command.</P>
<P>When it was recommended to the <HI>people</HI> of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, to choo&s;e officers them&s;elves to command them, our Captain was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to take the command of the fir&s;t company in the town of Roxbury, (his old and favourite company;) and on the meeting of the Captains and &s;ubalterns of the fir&s;t regiment of militia in Suffolk, he was cho&s;en Colonel.</P>
<P>The people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, having determined to &s;upport their rights and liberties at every hazard, (finding that &s;uch was the &s;en&s;e of the people of their &s;i&s;ter Colonies) after the di&s;&s;olution of their General Court, elected a Provincial Congre&s;s. This Congre&s;s appointed a <HI>Committee of Safety</HI> (of whom our Colonel was one,) ve&s;ted with executive pow|ers; and another committee, called the <HI>Committee of Supplies.</HI> The latter were to purcha&s;e military &s;tores, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. and depo&s;it them in &s;uch pla|ces as the former &s;hould direct. Both committees entered on the duties of their re&s;pective functions. The Provincial Congre&s;s voted a &s;um of money for the purpo&s;e of procuring military &s;tores and provi&s;|ions; and a quantity of both were collected, and &s;tored in the town of Concord.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">
The militia, and the corps of minute-men, as they were called, (the latter compo&s;ed of the young and active) were furni&s;hed with officers of their own choo&s;ing. The greate&s;t attention was exhibited by the officers, which was as cheerfully &s;econded by the citizen &s;oldiers, to acquire a knowledge of mil|itary duty.</P>
<P>In the month of February, 1775, the Provincial Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed the following re&s;olutions:</P>

<P>Gen. Prebble declined the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In the month of March following, the Provincial Congre&s;s appointed a committee to make a minute inquiry into the &s;tate of the operations of the Briti&s;h army. On the 20th of the &s;ame month, the com|mittee reported, that the Briti&s;h army then con&s;i&s;ted of about 2850 men, di&s;tributed as follows: On Bo&s;ton common, about 1700; on Fort-Hill, 400; on Bo&s;ton neck, 340; in barracks at the Ca&s;tle, 330; quartered in King-&s;treet, 80;&mdash;that they were erecting works on Bo&s;ton neck, on both &s;ides of the way, well con&s;tructed and well executed; the works were in forwardne&s;s, and then mounted with ten bra&s;s and two iron cannon; that the old fortification, at the entrance of the town, was repaired, and render|ed much &s;tronger by the addition of timber and earth to the parapet; that ten pieces of iron cannon were mounted on the old platforms; that a block|hou&s;e, brought from Governor's I&s;land, was erecting on the &s;outh &s;ide of the neck, between the old forti|fication and the new works advanced on the neck.</P>
<P>On the 18th of April, our General had been &s;itting with the Committee of Safety, at Menotomy in Cam|bridge; and on his return home, &s;oon after he left the committee, and about &s;un-&s;etting, he met eight or nine Briti&s;h officers on hor&s;eback, with their &s;words and pi&s;tols, riding up the road towards Lex|ington. The time of day, and di&s;tance from Bo&s;ton, excited &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome de&s;ign. They indeed were out reconnoitring, and getting intelligence, but were not mole&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10">
On the 19th, at day-break, our General was awoke, called from his bed, and informed that a de|tachment of the Briti&s;h army were out; that they had cro&s;&s;ed from Bo&s;ton to Phipps's farm, in boats, and had gone towards Concord, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, with intent to de&s;troy the public &s;tores. They probably had notice that the committees had met the preceding day at Wetherby's tavern, at Me|notomy; for, when they came oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e, they halted. Several of the gentlemen &s;lept there during the night. Among them were Col. Orne, Col. Lee, and Mr. Gerry. One of them awoke, and informed the others that a body of the Briti&s;h were before the hou&s;e. They immediately made their e&s;cape, without time to dre&s;s them&s;elves, at the back door, receiving &s;ome injury from ob&s;tacles in the way, in their undre&s;&s;ed &s;tate. They made their way into the fields. The country was immediately alarmed, and the minute-men and militia turned out with great &s;pirit. Near Lexington meeting-hou&s;e the Briti&s;h found the militia of that town drawn up by the road. Towards the&s;e they advanced, ordered them to di&s;per&s;e, huzzaed, and fired upon them; when &s;everal were killed and wounded, and the re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed. This was the fir&s;t &s;hedding of blood in the American war.</P>
<P>This company continuing to &s;tand &s;o near to the road, after they had certain notice of the advancing of the Briti&s;h in force, was but a too much braving of danger; for they were &s;ure to meet with in&s;ult, or injury, which they could not repel. Bravery, when called to action, &s;hould always take the &s;trong ground on the ba&s;is of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h proceeded on to Concord, where they de&s;troyed a part of the &s;tores, while others were &s;av|ed by the vigilance, activity, or policy, of the inhab|itants. In the latter, a Capt. Wheeler practi&s;ed with
<PB N="13" REF="11">
&s;uch addre&s;s, as to &s;ave a con&s;iderable quantity of flour, although expo&s;ed to the <HI>critical examination</HI> of a Briti&s;h officer.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h had &s;ent a party to the North Bridge, while they were de&s;troying the &s;tores in the town. A body of militia, who had retreated beyond the bridge, and collected in this quarter, now marched up re&s;olutely to the bridge. The Briti&s;h officer, finding their firmne&s;s, ordered his men to fire, which they did, and two men of the militia were killed. The fire was bri&s;kly returned; &s;ome were killed and wounded of the enemy, and an officer taken pri&s;|oner. The Briti&s;h party retreated with precipita|tion to their main body, and the whole &s;oon com|menced their retreat towards Bo&s;ton; the militia galling them on all &s;ides. This detatchment, under the command of Col. Smith, mu&s;t have been worn down, and the whole of them killed, or taken pri&s;|oners, had it not been for the reinforcement &s;ent out to them, under the command of Lord Percy, with two field-pieces, who joined them in the lower part of the town of Lexington.</P>
<P>Our General, in the morning, proceeded to the Committee of Safety. From the committee, he took a cro&s;s road to Watertown, the Briti&s;h being in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lexington road. At Watertown, find|ing &s;ome militia who had not marched, but applied for orders, he &s;ent them down to Cambridge, with directions to take up the planks, barricade the &s;outh end of the bridge, and there to take po&s;t; that, in ca&s;e the Briti&s;h &s;hould, on their return, take that road to Bo&s;ton, their retreat might be impeded. He then pu&s;hed to join the militia, taking a cro&s;s road towards Lexington, in which he was joined by Dr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Warren,</HI> (afterwards a Major-General) who kept with him.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12">
Our General joined the militia ju&s;t after Lord Percy had joined the Briti&s;h; and having a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming a regiment, which had been broken by the &s;hot from the Briti&s;h field-pieces, (for the di&s;charge of the&s;e, together with the flames and &s;moke of &s;everal buildings, to which the Briti&s;h, nearly at the &s;ame time, had &s;et fire, opened a new and more terrific &s;cene;) and the Briti&s;h having again taken up their retreat, were clo&s;ely pur&s;ued. On de&s;cending from the high grounds in Menoto|my, on to the plain, the fire was bri&s;k. At this in|&s;tant, a mu&s;ket-ball came &s;o near to the head of Dr. Warren, as to <HI>&s;trike the pin out of the hair of his earlock.</HI> Soon after, the right flank of the Briti&s;h was expo&s;ed to the fire of a body of militia, which had come from Roxbury, Brooklyn, Dorche&s;ter, &amp;c. For a few minutes the fire was bri&s;k on both &s;ides; and the Briti&s;h had here recour&s;e to their field-pieces again; but they were now more familiar than be|fore. Here the militia were &s;o clo&s;e on the rear of the Briti&s;h, that Dr. <HI>Downer,</HI> an active and enter|pri&s;ing man, came to &s;ingle combat with a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, whom he killed with his bayonet.</P>
<P>Not far from this place, &s;everal of the militia (among whom was I&s;aac Gardner, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Brooklyn, a valuable citizen) imprudently po&s;ted them&s;elves behind &s;ome dry ca&s;ks, at Wat&s;on's Corner, and near to the road, un&s;u&s;picious of the enemy's flank|guard, which came behind them, and killed every one of them dead on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The militia continued to hang on the rear of the Briti&s;h, until they reached Bunker's Hill in Charle&s;|town; and it had become &s;o du&s;k, as to render the fla&s;hes of the mu&s;kets very vi&s;ible. At this in&s;tant, an officer on hor&s;eback came up from the Medford road, and inquired the circum&s;tances of the enemy; adding, that about 700 men were clo&s;e behind, on
<PB N="15" REF="13">
their way from Salem to join the militia. Had the&s;e arrived a few minutes &s;ooner, the left flank of the Briti&s;h mu&s;t have been greatly expo&s;ed, and &s;uffered con&s;iderably; perhaps their retreat would have been cut off. As &s;oon as the Briti&s;h gained Bunker's Hill, they immediately formed in a line oppo&s;ite to the neck; when our General judged it expedient to order the militia, who were now at the common, to halt, and give over the pur&s;uit, as any further attempt up|on the enemy, in that po&s;ition, would have been futile.</P>
<P>Our General immediately a&s;&s;embled the officers around him, at the foot of Pro&s;pect Hill, and ordered a guard to be formed, and po&s;ted near that place, centinels to be planted down to the neck, and pa|troles to be vigilant in moving during the night; and an immediate report to him, in ca&s;e the enemy made any movements. The militia were then ordered to march to the town of Cambridge; where, after forming and &s;ending off another guard to the points below the town, the whole were ordered to lie on their arms.</P>
<P>About midnight, there was an alarm that the en|emy were coming up the river. It proved to be only an armed &s;chooner, probably &s;ent to make di&s;covery. She got a-ground, and continued &s;o until the next tide; and if there had been a &s;ingle field-piece with the militia, &s;he might have been taken. The mar&s;h was too deep to approach &s;ufficiently near to do any execution with &s;mall-arms; and the fir&s;t day's ho&s;+tilities of the ever memorable American war, was, on their part, without a &s;ingle piece of cannon in the field! Gen. WHITCOMB was in this day's battle.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 20th, our General ordered Capt. <HI>John Battle,</HI> of Dedham with his company of militia, to pa&s;s over the ground which had been the &s;cene of action the preceding day, and to bury &s;uch of the &s;lain as he &s;hould find unburied. The grounds
<PB N="16" REF="14">
around Cambridge were immediately reconnoitred, and alarm-po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned to the &s;everal corps; and in ca&s;e the Briti&s;h &s;hould come out in &s;uperior force, and drive the militia from the town, they were or|dered to rally and form on the high grounds to|wards Watertown.</P>
<P>How to <HI>feed</HI> the a&s;&s;embled and a&s;&s;embling militia, was now the great object. All the eatables in the town of Cambridge, which could be &s;pared, were collected for breakfa&s;t, and the college kitchen and uten&s;ils procured for cooking. Some carca&s;&s;es of beef and pork, prepared for the Bo&s;ton market on the 18th, at Little Cambridge, were &s;ent for, and obtained; and a large quantity of &s;hip-bread at Rox|bury, &s;aid to belong to the Briti&s;h navy, was taken for the militia. The&s;e were the fir&s;t provi&s;ions which were obtained.</P>
<P>At 11 o'clock, A. M. our General appointed Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Ward,</HI> a gentleman of abilities, his Aid-de|camp and Secretary, (afterwards Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter-Gen|eral of the army) who entered on the duties of his new office&mdash;This was the fir&s;t appointment of the kind in the American army. Before noon, a letter was re|ceived from the Committee of Supplies at Concord, ex|pre&s;&s;ing their joy at the event of the preceding day, with a&s;&s;urances that every exertion in their power &s;hould be put in exerci&s;e, to forward &s;upplies to the militia in arms. In the afternoon, Gen. WARD ar|rived at Cambridge, who, being &s;enior in the order of appointment, took the command accordingly.</P>
<P>In the battle on the 19th, the Briti&s;h were &s;aid to have 65 killed, 180 wounded, and 28 made pri&s;on|ers; in all, 273. Of the militia, 50 were killed, and 34 wounded; in all, 84. It might have been expected, that in a retreat of &s;o many miles, the Briti&s;h lo&s;s would have been greater; but it is to be remembered, that as they kept the road, the fences

<P>Gen. WARD was now the Commander in Chief of the a&s;&s;embled army, and exerci&s;ed the immediate command on the Cambridge &s;ide; while Gen. Thomas had the immediate command on the Rox|bury &s;ide. A few days after this, the Cambridge camp being very numerous, and the Roxbury camp judged to be too weak, the Briti&s;h having gone over from Charle&s;town to Bo&s;ton, Gen. Ward ordered our General, with three or four regiments, to march from Cambridge, and reinforce Gen. Thomas; and he continued in the Roxbury camp until after the arri|val of Gen. WASHINGTON, in the month of July.</P>
<P>In the month of May, the Provincial Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions for rai&s;ing twenty-four regiments, to &s;erve during the remainder of the year. The
<PB N="18" REF="16">
General Officers were each to have a regiment. As the new regiments began to recruit, the militia went home, and the camps became very weak; that at Roxbury did not exceed 1000 men. Had the Brit|i&s;h &s;allied at that time, there would have been but few to oppo&s;e them on that &s;ide. However, the ar|my &s;oon became &s;trong, it being reinforced by the arrival of Gen. Putnam from Connecticut, Gen. Sullivan from New-Hamp&s;hire, and Gen. Greene from Rhode-I&s;land; each with a re&s;pectable body of troops; and, in the month of June, it was deter|mined to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights of Charle&s;|town. Preparations were made for the purpo&s;e; and on the 16th, at night, a &s;trong detachment from the American army marched on, and broke ground on <HI>Breed's Hill,</HI> in front of Bunker's Hill. The latter ought to have been taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of at the &s;ame time, but it was &s;ome how omitted.</P>
<P>By the morning of the 17th, the troops had a redoubt and line on its left flank in good forwardne&s;s, when they were di&s;covered by the Briti&s;h. The Lively man-of-war fir&s;t began to cannonade the Americans; &s;he was &s;oon &s;econded by other &s;hips, floating batteries, and &s;ome heavy cannon on <HI>Cop's Hill,</HI> on the Bo&s;|ton &s;ide, which the Americans bore with a good de|gree of firmne&s;s, and continued at their work. The Briti&s;h army in Bo&s;ton were greatly alarmed at this near approach, and immediately re&s;olved on an at|tack, before the works could be completed. A detachment was formed for the purpo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of ten companies of Grenadiers, ten of Light Infan|try, and the 5th, 38th, 43d, and 52d regiments, and a corps of Artillery under the command of Maj. Gen. Howe, and Brig. Gen. Pigot. In the afternoon they landed on Charle&s;town Point without oppo&s;i|tion, where they were afterwards reinforced by the 47th regiment, and fir&s;t battalion of marines. The
<PB N="19" REF="17">
regiments in Cambridge camp were ordered down to &s;upport the detachment at Charle&s;town, and to occupy other po&s;ts thought to be e&s;&s;ential, and con|tiguous thereto. The Briti&s;h began their attack with a &s;evere fire of artillery, and advanced in a &s;low and regular pace. The Americans who had march|ed on to the aid of the detachment, con&s;i&s;ting of the New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut troops, ha&s;tily formed a line of defence, compo&s;ed of rails and other materials found neare&s;t at hand. This line extended down towards the low ground on the left, and was nobly defended. The Americans re&s;erved their fire until the Briti&s;h came very near, when they gave it to great effect; it &s;taggered, and even broke them, but they rallied, and returning to the charge again and again, drove the Americans from the lines on the left of the redoubt, and had nearly &s;urrounded it, when the Americans ru&s;hed out of the redoubt, their ammunition being ex|pended, and made their retreat, even through a part of the Briti&s;h forces. About this time Maj. Gen. <HI>Warren,</HI> who had been but a few days before com|mi&s;&s;ioned, and was then on the hill as a &s;pecta|tor only, was killed. A number of the Americans were killed in retreating from Breed's Hill, to Bun|ker Hill, and &s;ome in pa&s;&s;ing off over the neck. Perhaps there never was a better fought battle than this, all things con&s;idered; and too much prai&s;e can never be be&s;towed on the conduct of Col. <HI>Wil|liam Pre&s;cott,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding any thing that may have been &s;aid, <HI>was the proper commanding of|ficer,</HI> at the redoubt, and nobly acted his part as &s;uch, during the whole action.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before the action began, Gen. Putnam came to the redoubt, and told Col. Pre&s;cott that the en|trenching tools mu&s;t be &s;ent off, or they would be lo&s;t; the Colonel replied, that if he &s;ent any of the
<PB N="20" REF="18">
men away with the tools, not one of them would return; to this the General an&s;wered, they &s;hall every man return. A large party was then &s;ent off with the tools, and not one of them returned; in this in&s;tance the Colonel was the be&s;t judge of hu|man nature.</P>
<P>In the time of action, Col. Pre&s;cott ob&s;erving that the brave Gen. Warren was near the works, he im|mediately &s;tepped up to him, and a&s;ked him if he had any orders to give him. The General replied that he had none, that he exerci&s;ed no command there<HI>&mdash;"The commana,"</HI> &s;aid the General, <HI>"is yours."</HI></P>
<P>While many officers and &s;oldiers gallantly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in this action, others were blamed, and &s;ome were brought to trial by court-martial. This was a &s;ore battle to the Briti&s;h, who did not forget it, during &s;everal campaigns, nor until a tide of &s;ucce&s;&s;es in their favour had removed it from their minds. Their whole force on this day, which was in action, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 2,000, and their whole lo&s;s, in killed and wounded, was &s;aid to be upwards of 1,000, of whom 226 were killed, and of the&s;e, 19 were commi&s;&s;ioned officers, including one Lieutenant-Colonel, two Majors, and &s;even Cap|tains. Another account &s;tated their killed and wounded to be 753 privates, 202 &s;erjeants and cor|porals, and 92 commi&s;&s;ioned officers; in the whole, 1047. The lo&s;s of the Americans, in killed, wound|ed, and pri&s;oners, about 450.</P>
<P>At the time the Briti&s;h made their attack, the hou&s;es in Charle&s;town were &s;et on fire, and burnt mo&s;t furiou&s;ly, which increa&s;ed the horrors of the &s;cene. At the &s;ame time a furious cannonade and throwing of &s;hells took place at the lines on Bo&s;ton neck, again&s;t Roxbury, with intent to burn that town; but although &s;everal &s;hells fell among the hou&s;es, and &s;ome carca&s;&s;es near them, and balls went

through &s;ome; no other damage was &s;u&s;tained than the lo&s;s of one man killed by a &s;hot driving a &s;tone from a wall again&s;t him.</P>
<P>On the 15th, Congre&s;s appointed GEORGE WASH|INGTON Commander in Chief; and on the 17th Artemas Ward, fir&s;t Major-General&mdash;Charles Lee, &s;econd Major-General&mdash;Horatio Gates, Adjutant-General, with the rank of Brigadier-General; and on the 19th, Philip Schuyler, third Major-General, and I&s;rael Putnam, fourth Major-General; and on the 22d, Seth Pomeroy, fir&s;t Brigadier-General&mdash;Richard Montgomery, &s;econd do. David Woo&s;ter, third do. William Heath, fourth do. Jo&s;eph Spen|cer, fifth do. John Thomas, &s;ixth do. John Sullivan, &s;eventh do. Nathaniel Green, eighth do. and made provi&s;ion for rai&s;ing an army for the defence of the United Colonies. Before the&s;e appointments were made known at camp, on the 21&s;t of June, our General received from the Provincial Congre&s;s, a commi&s;&s;ion of Major-General. Generals Ward, Thomas, and Warren, had before received their commi&s;&s;ions, the latter ju&s;t before he was &s;lain. Gen. Pomeroy declining an acceptance of the com|mi&s;&s;ion from Congre&s;s, that Honorable Body, on the 19th of July, re&s;olved that Gen. Thomas be ap|pointed fir&s;t Brigadier-General in the army of the United Colonies, in the room of Gen. Pomeroy, who never acted under the commi&s;&s;ion &s;ent to him, and that Gen. Thomas's commi&s;&s;ion bear the &s;ame date that Gen. Pomeroy's did; indeed this was the rank to which Gen. Thomas was entitled by former &s;tand|ing. Congre&s;s now al&s;o appointed Jo&s;eph Trumbull to be Commi&s;&s;ary-General of &s;tores and provi&s;ions, for the army, but left the appointment of a Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General, and &s;ome other officers, to Gen. Wa&s;hington, who appointed the able and very ac|tive Col. Thomas Mifflin, Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
who did him&s;elf much honour, and his country &s;er|vice, in this important department.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle of Bunker Hill, the Americans began to erect works on Pro&s;pect Hill, a very commanding height above Charle&s;town com|mon, and at &s;everal other places. Several works were al&s;o con&s;tructed at Roxbury, and the Briti&s;h confined to Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;town, within the neck.</P>
<P>The works now going on, both on the Cambridge and Roxbury &s;ide, were con&s;iderable, and there was a great want of engineers. Col. Gridley was chief Engineer, and was aided by his &s;on. But the &s;trength of body, activity and genius of the Americans ca|pable of con&s;tructing with &s;urpri&s;ing di&s;patch any works in which they were guided, called for many in&s;tructors in this department. Lieut. Col. Rufus Putnam, of Col. David Brewer's regiment, was very &s;erviceable in this line, on the Roxbury &s;ide; as was al&s;o Capt. Jo&s;iah Waters of Bo&s;ton, and Capt. Bald|win of Brookfield, (afterwards Colonel of Artificers) and others on the Cambridge &s;ide, and Capt. Henry Knox, who had been an officer in the Bo&s;ton Gren|adier Company, (and who was afterwards at the head of the American artillery, to the clo&s;e of the war) occa&s;ionally lent his aid. His military genius and acquaintance with our General, led him to be importunate with Capt. Knox to join the army; nor did he need per&s;ua&s;ion to join in the cau&s;e of his country. His removal out of Bo&s;ton, and the then &s;tate of his dome&s;tic concerns, required &s;ome previous arrangement; as &s;oon as this was effected, he joined the army.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;About noon, a heavy cannonade and throwing of &s;hells from the lines on Bo&s;ton neck into Roxbury&mdash;but no damage done. Two Amer|ican &s;oldiers attempting to &s;et fire to Brown's barn,
<PB N="23" REF="21">
on Bo&s;ton neck, were killed by the Briti&s;h. The &s;ame evening two heavy cannon were brought to the work on the hill above Roxbury work-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;At night, an attempt was made to burn the buildings on Bo&s;ton neck; a firing took place between the parties, but the object was not effected.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;A party of Briti&s;h, about day break, ad|vanced and fired on the American centinels near the George tavern. The picket turned out&mdash;the Briti&s;h retreated.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;A platform in the work above Rox|bury work-hou&s;e being laid, a 24 pounder was mounted and di&s;charged twice at the Briti&s;h lines; the &s;econd &s;hot grazed the parapet and &s;truck on the parade, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome confu&s;ion: There was more or le&s;s firing of cannon on both &s;ides, daily: All the works were pu&s;hed with the utmo&s;t dili|gence.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;About two o'clock, P. M. Gen. WASHING|TON, attended by &s;everal officers, arrived at the camp in Cambridge.</P>
<P>On the morning of this day, the Briti&s;h cannon|aded bri&s;kly from their lines on Bo&s;ton neck again&s;t Roxbury, and threw &s;ome &s;hells; a carca&s;s &s;et fire to the hou&s;e of Mr. Williams, the tinman, which was burnt down; by the activity of the troops, the flames were prevented from &s;preading further, al|though they had to work in the face of a con&s;tant and heavy fire from the enemy.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington, accompanied by Major-Gen. Lee, vi&s;ited the Roxbury camp, works, &amp;c.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;A little after two o'clock in the morning, a number of volunteers, under the command of Majors <HI>Tupper</HI> and <HI>Crane,</HI> attacked the Briti&s;h ad|vance guard at Brown's hou&s;e, on Bo&s;ton neck, and routed them, took a halbert, a mu&s;ket, and two bayonets, and burnt the two hou&s;es; the &s;tore and
<PB N="24" REF="22">
barn e&s;caped the flames; a &s;cattering fire at the out|po&s;t continued for &s;ome time; a floating battery was brought up into the bay, and moored &s;o as to cover the right flank of the Briti&s;h works on the neck.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;In the morning, a party of Americans drove back the Briti&s;h advance guard, and burnt Brown's &s;tore. The &s;ame night a detachment went on to Long-I&s;land, and brought off the &s;tock, &amp;c. The next day in the forenoon, Col. Greaton with 136 men, went on to Long-I&s;land, and burnt the barns; the flames communicated to the hou&s;e, and all were con&s;umed. An armed &s;chooner, and &s;ev|eral barges put off after the Americans, and &s;ome of the &s;hips of war near the i&s;land, cannonaded them. The detachment made their way for the &s;hore, and narrowly e&s;caped being taken. One man on the &s;hore who came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the detachment, was killed: It was &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;everal of the Brit|i&s;h were killed and wounded. The &s;ame day &s;ix tran&s;ports, appearing to be full of men, arrived in Bo&s;ton harbour.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;A heavy cannonade from the Briti&s;h, at the American workmen&mdash;but no damage done. Gen. Wa&s;hington vi&s;ited the camp. The men were employed on the works going on upon the &s;trong rocky hill, (Col. Williams's) to the &s;outh-we&s;t of tho&s;e above Roxbury work-hou&s;e. This was one of the &s;tronge&s;t works which were erected.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h fired &s;everal cannon, and a Connecticut &s;oldier was killed in the &s;treet, near the George tavern. The &s;hot entered his body, drove it &s;ome di&s;tance, and lodged in him, in a remarkable manner.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Five tran&s;port &s;hips arrived in Bo&s;ton harbour. Fre&s;h provi&s;ions were very &s;carce and dear, in Bo&s;ton&mdash;mutton and veal, <HI>2&s;.</HI> per pound; fre&s;h beef and pork a pi&s;tareen, &s;alt pork &s;ixpence.</P>

The detachment under his command, brought off 1,000 bu&s;hels of barley, all the hay, &amp;c.&mdash;went to Light-Hou&s;e I&s;land; took away the lamps, oil, &s;ome gun|powder, the boats, &amp;c. and burnt the wooden parts of the light-hou&s;e. An armed &s;chooner and &s;everal boats, with men, engaged the detachment; of the Americans, two were wounded.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;A general order came out for forming the army into divi&s;ions and brigades.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Ward removed from Cam|bridge, and took the immediate command of the troops at Roxbury.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h formed a bomb battery, at Bunker's-Hill, and advanced their advance guard.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;In the morning, there was a &s;kirmi&s;h at Charle&s;town neck, between the riflemen and &s;ome Briti&s;h troops. Two of the latter were taken pri&s;on|ers, and &s;everal were killed. Of the riflemen, one was killed. The &s;ame day, the Briti&s;h advanced over the neck, and threw up a &s;light work to cover their guard.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;A little before one o'clock, A. M. a Brit|i&s;h floating-battery came up the river, within 300 yards of Sewall's Point, and fired a number of &s;hot at the American works, on both &s;ides of the river. At the &s;ame time, the Briti&s;h, on Bo&s;ton neck, &s;alli|ed towards Roxbury; drove in the American centi|nels, &s;et fire to the George tavern, and returned to their works. The &s;ame morning, Major Tupper, with 300 Americans, went to Light-Hou&s;e I&s;land, attacked a Briti&s;h guard of 33 marines, killed a &s;ub|altern officer and &s;everal &s;oldiers, took 23 pri&s;oners, &s;everal refugees, and burnt all the buildings on the i&s;land, with the lo&s;s of one American &s;oldier. There

was a firing, during the day, from the Briti&s;h, at Charle&s;town, at intervals. Two Americans were killed; an officer, and &s;everal Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been killed. The Americans took &s;everal mu&s;kets.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2d.&mdash;There was a con&s;iderable firing be|tween the advanced parties, and the Americans burnt a barn, near Charle&s;town neck, in which the Briti&s;h had &s;ome hay. A Briti&s;h officer was wound I, and carried within their lines.</P>

<P>2d.&mdash;The Briti&s;h threw up a &s;light work on Bo&s;ton neck, advanced of their lines, to cover their guard. Cannonading and throwing of &s;hells, on this day, both again&s;t Roxbury and Plowed Hill. Two &s;hells fell into the works on the latter, but did no harm.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;A &s;erjeant, belonging to the 64th Briti&s;h regiment, and a &s;eaman, were taken pri&s;oners at Noddle's I&s;land. The heavy rains, about this time, did &s;ome damage to the American works. Prepara|tions were made for &s;ending a detachment to Canada.</P>

<P>Generals Schuyler and Montgomery were mak|ing their way into Canada, with a con&s;iderable force, by way of the lakes. They had advanced as far as Fort St. John's; but, finding that this fort would make con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance, they fell back. Schuyler returned to Albany, to hold a treaty with the Indians; and Montgomery waited for the arri|val of his artillery, that he might reduce the forts.</P>
<P>Some time before this, Col. Ethan Allen, of the New-Hamp&s;hire Grants, (&s;ince Vermont) with a number of volunteers, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ticondero|ga. The artillery, &s;ecured by Allen, were an ac|qui&s;ition to the Americans; and Col. Knox went up the next winter, and &s;elected and brought forward a number of pieces to the camp, before Bo&s;ton. The garri&s;on of this place, which was commanded by a Captain, apprehending no danger, were negli|gent, and remi&s;s in duty. Allen was acquaint|ed at the place; and now, as is &s;aid, reque&s;ted a part of the garri&s;on to aid him, in tran&s;porting &s;ome goods. Nearly half of the garri&s;on were granted him. The&s;e were plentifully &s;erved with liquor; and, in the night, Allen entered the fort, and de|manded a delivery of it. The commandant a&s;king by what authority he required him to &s;urrender, Al|len replied&mdash;"I demand it in the name of the great Jehovah and the Continental Congre&s;s." He al&s;o took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown-Point; and, before Mont|gomery was ready to proceed again&s;t the Forts Chambly and St. John's, Allen determined to &s;ur|pri&s;e Montreal. For this purpo&s;e, he marched acro&s;s, with a body of militia; but he was met, be|fore he got to the town, by what force the Briti&s;h could collect there, who attacked and defeated Allen, taking him, and a number of his party, pri&s;oners.

He was put in irons, and &s;ent in a man-of-war to Eng|land. His narrative was long &s;ince publi&s;hed.</P>

<P><HI>October</HI> 3d and 4th.&mdash;General Officers in coun|cil, on the &s;uppo&s;ed treachery of Dr. Church, who was taken into clo&s;e cu&s;tody, and afterward kept in confinement.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;A bri&s;k cannonade at Roxbury. An Amer|ican lo&s;t an arm. An 18 pound &s;hot went through the gate-way, at the Briti&s;h lines, as their guard was marching out.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h did &s;ome mi&s;chief at Bri&s;tol, in Rhode-I&s;land. The report of the cannon were heard at camp.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Two American floating-batteries were rowed down the river; &s;everal &s;hot were di&s;charged towards the Briti&s;h. A 9 pounder bur&s;t, and 5 or 6 men were wounded; one of which died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;hips had entered the harbour of Ca&s;co Bay, and burnt a part of the town of Falmouth.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28">
<HI>November</HI> 4th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h fort at Chambly, on the lake, had &s;urren|dered to the Americans. The artillery and military &s;tores in this fort were truly an acqui&s;ition. The privateers fitted out by the Americans, about this time, began to &s;end in a few prizes.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;At the top of high water, the tide being very full, &s;ome Briti&s;h light-infantry, in boats, came over from Bo&s;ton, and landed on Leechmore's Point. The centinels on the point came off; the alarm was given; and &s;everal hundred Americans forded over the cau&s;eway, in the face of the Briti&s;h, the water at lea&s;t two feet deep. The Briti&s;h, &s;eeing the &s;pirit of the Americans, although they were very advanta|geou&s;ly po&s;ted, made a precipitate retreat to their boats. Three or four Americans were wounded, one mortally. The Briti&s;h &s;hip and floating-batte|ries kept up a bri&s;k fire; but to little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;The King of England's Proclamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing rebellion (as he called it) made its ap|pearance. It was taken on board a ve&s;&s;el from Ire|land, which was captured by an American crui&s;er. It was reported that the Briti&s;h had received a rein|forcement.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Intelligence was received of the capitulation of the Briti&s;h garri&s;on of Fort St. John's on the lake. Montgomery was now proceeding rapidly into Cana|da. His troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Montreal on the 13th.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Several de&s;erters came in, and two &s;oldiers were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;A &s;trong detachment from the army, under the command of Maj. Gen. Putnam, broke ground on Cobble Hill, without annoyance. The fatigue|men worked until near break of day, when the whole came off.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;At night, our General, with a detachment of &s;imilar &s;trength to that of the preceding night,
<PB N="31" REF="29">
were ordered to Cobble Hill, to complete the works. A &s;ally from the Briti&s;h was expected, and Col. Bridge with his regiment was ordered to the foot of the hill, and to patrole towards the bay and neck, con&s;tantly, during the night. The picket at Pro&s;|pect Hill was al&s;o ordered to be in readine&s;s to &s;uc|cour the troops at the works, if they were attacked; and Col. Bond's regiment al&s;o lay on their arms; but the Briti&s;h did not move. Two of the Briti&s;h centinels came off in the night to the detachment; the whole came off at day-break; and other troops were ordered on the works, in the day time, now in good forwardne&s;s, and defen&s;ible.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;An additional &s;hip came up and took &s;ta|tion at the ferry. Upon a few &s;hot being fired, by the American advance centinels, the Briti&s;h drums on Bunker's Hill beat to arms, which were followed by the Americans. At this time the Briti&s;h were erecting &s;everal bomb-batteries at Bo&s;ton to annoy the Americans. Col. Enos, who was of Col. Arnold's detachment, from the army de&s;tined to cro&s;s the woods by a north-ea&s;tern route into Canada, having proceed|ed a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, Arnold's &s;ick return|ing back, and his own men growing &s;ickly, returned with his part of the detachment. This le&s;&s;ened the ex|pectation of &s;ucce&s;s to the American army in Canada.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Cape-Ann, that a ve&s;&s;el from England, laden with warlike &s;tores, had been taken and brought into that place. There was on board one 13 inch bra&s;s mortar, 2,000 &s;tand of arms, 100,000 flints, 32 tons of leaden ball, &amp;c. &amp;c. A fortunate capture for the Americans!</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 2d.&mdash;The bra&s;s 13 inch mortar, and &s;undry military &s;tores, taken in the ordnance prize, were brought to camp.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Col. Arnold had made his way &s;afely into Canada.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="30">
12th.&mdash;A cau&s;eway was begun over the mar&s;h, to Leechmore's Point. Two 18 pounders were brought from Roxbury, and mounted at Cobble Hill.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;An expre&s;s arrived from Marblehead, with advice that three Briti&s;h men-of-war were &s;tanding for that harbour. Col. Glover's regiment, with Capt. For&s;ter's company of artillery, and a company of riflemen, were ordered to march to Marblehead with all expedition.</P>
<P>14th, 15th, and 16th.&mdash;Approaches were carried bri&s;kly on to Leechmore's Point, and nearly to the top of the hill.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The morning was foggy. A detachment of 300 men, under the direction of Gen. Putnam, broke ground on the top of the hill, on Leechmore's Point, at a di&s;tance of not more than half a mile from the &s;hip. Between twelve and one o'clock, the fog cleared away, and the &s;hip began to cannonade the Americans, with round and grape &s;hot, and &s;ome &s;hells were thrown from We&s;t-Bo&s;ton: One &s;oldier was wounded, and the party driven from the works. Several cannon were fired from Cobble Hill, at the &s;hip; one &s;hot was &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;truck her.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Our General was ordered, with 300 men, to pro&s;ecute the work begun on Leechmore's Point. It was expected that this would have been a bloody day, and Dr. Downer, one of the &s;urgeons, was ordered down with the detachment, with his in&s;tru|ments, &amp;c. to a&s;&s;i&s;t the wounded. Fortunately for the detachment, Capt. Smith of the artillery, had, in the morning, di&s;charged an 18 pounder from Cobble Hill at the &s;hip, which induced her to weigh anchor, and run below the ferry-way.</P>
<P>When our General arrived nearly at the &s;ummit of the hill, he halted the detachment, and went for|ward him&s;elf, and took a view of the &s;tate of the works, which in &s;ome places were but ju&s;t begun;
<PB N="33" REF="31">
in others were carried half way up. He then order|ed the front company to move up the hill, ground their arms, and move into a part of the works a&s;&s;ign|ed to them&mdash;and &s;o on through the whole, to prevent confu&s;ion in entering the works, and thereby in|crea&s;ing an object to the Briti&s;h gunners. As &s;oon as the men were placed in the works, two centinels were po&s;ted to watch the Briti&s;h batteries, with or|ders, on di&s;covering the di&s;charge of cannon, to call out, <HI>a &s;hot!</HI> The men in the works were ordered to be &s;teady; on the &s;ignal of a &s;hot, to &s;ettle down and remain &s;o, until the &s;hot had &s;truck; or if a &s;hell, until it had bur&s;t; then to ri&s;e and pro&s;ecute the work&mdash;no man to &s;tep out of his place. In a very &s;hort time, a &s;hot was cried by the centinels. It prov|ed to be a &s;hell, which fell and bur&s;t within a few feet of a part of the workmen, throwing the dirt among them, and a piece of the &s;hell hitting a &s;ol|dier's hat. On the &s;econd di&s;charge, the men fell as before; when, on ri&s;ing, two or three heavy can|non-&s;hot &s;truck in the face of the work; the Briti&s;h having di&s;charged the cannon in &s;uch time after the mortar, as that the &s;hot might take effect ju&s;t as the men aro&s;e after the bur&s;ting of the &s;hell: but in this they did not &s;ucceed; the men being ordered to keep down until both had &s;truck. Finding this de|ception to fail, a &s;hell was broke in the air, directly over the party, at 60 or 70 feet high. This al&s;o had as little effect upon the Americans. The fire continued until the afternoon, when it cea&s;ed: and it was afterwards learnt, that the commanding-officer of the Briti&s;h artillery, who &s;tood and ob&s;erved the effect of their fire upon the Americans, went to their General, and informed him, that from his own ob|&s;ervation, their fire had no other effect than to inure the Americans to danger, and advi&s;ed its di&s;continu|ance. In the afternoon, Gen. Wa&s;hington and &s;ev|eral
<PB N="34" REF="32">
other General Officers came on to the Point. Towards night, the detachment were ordered to move out of the works by companies, as they went in; take up their arms, move under the hill, and form the detachment; from whence it was marched to Cambridge, attended by their &s;urgeon, who had been in waiting all the day, but had no occa&s;ion to draw his in&s;truments from their ca&s;e, or a bandage or dre&s;&s;ing from his box.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The pro&s;ecution of the works on Leech|more's Point was continued. The Briti&s;h cannon|aded and bombarded the new detachment; but to no effect. The &s;ame took place on the 20th. On this day, a 13 inch &s;hell was thrown almo&s;t up to No. 2. It was probably thrown, either at the works before mentioned, or at the colleges. It did not bur&s;t. Nearly five pounds of powder was taken out of the &s;hell.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The Briti&s;h threw one &s;hell, and fired two &s;hot, from Bunker's Hill in Charle&s;town, at the works on Leechmore's Point. The cannonade, &amp;c. continued, on the 23d and 24th; but to no effect.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;A &s;trong detachment from Winter Hill marched, in the night, to &s;urpri&s;e the Briti&s;h out|po&s;ts in Charle&s;town. They pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;outh &s;ide of Cobble Hill, and were to cro&s;s the cove on the ice. When they came to the channel, it was found to be open. A &s;oldier &s;lipping down on the ice, his piece accidentally went off, which cau&s;ed an alarm, and the detachment returned.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that there had been an action at Norfolk in Virginia, between Dunmore's army and the Virginians, to the advan|tage of the latter. Fifty of the regular toops were &s;aid to have been killed and wounded; among the former was Capt. <HI>Fordyce,</HI> of the 14th Briti&s;h regi|ment, an active and good officer. The Virginians had
<PB N="35" REF="33">
not a man killed. Dunmore's force was &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 500.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 1&s;t, 1776, pre&s;ented a great change in the American army. The officers and men of the new regiments were joining their re&s;pective corps; tho&s;e of the old regiments were going home by hun|dreds and by thou&s;ands. The be&s;t arms, &s;uch as were fit for &s;ervice, were detained from the &s;oldiers who were going home; they were to be paid for; but it created much unea&s;ine&s;s. Such a change, in the very teeth of an enemy, is a mo&s;t delicate ma|noeuvre; but the Briti&s;h did not attempt to take any advantage of it.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;It having been thought expedient to de|prive the Briti&s;h of the hou&s;es in Charle&s;town, below Bunker's Hill, a detachment was ordered for the purpo&s;e. One hundred men from the Fir&s;t Brigade, and a like number from Frye's Brigade, with Cap|tains Williams, Gould and Wyman; Lieutenants Fo&s;ter, Shaw, Patter&s;on and Trafton, and En&s;ign Cheney; the whole under the command of Major Knoulton, aided by Brigade-Majors Henly and Ca|rey. The detachment marched between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, and the object was effected without the lo&s;s of a man. Several Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were taken pri&s;oners. The garri&s;on of Bunker Hill works commenced a bri&s;k fire down the hill, towards the hou&s;es; but no damage was &s;u&s;tained. There had been a number of de&s;erters from the Briti&s;h, &s;ince tho&s;e heretofore mentioned.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the 31&s;t of December, at three o'clock, A. M. Gen. Mont|gomery made an attempt to carry Quebec by a&s;&s;ault. Col. Arnold had entered the lower city, and Gen. Montgomery was a&s;cending the barriers at the other end, when he was killed by a mu&s;ket-ball, as was his Aid-de-camp. A number of tho&s;e who had
<PB N="36" REF="34">
entered the lower city, were killed or taken pri&s;on|ers, and the enterpri&s;e defeated. No account of the American lo&s;s was at this time reported.</P>
<P>Great addre&s;s and gallantry were exhibited on this expedition. The Americans a&s;cending Kennebeck river, cro&s;&s;ing the height of land, and de&s;cending into Canada, was an arduous undertaking. Mont|gomery was fired with a noble ardor. He had been &s;ucce&s;sful hitherto, and the reduction of the city of Quebec would have been the fini&s;hing &s;troke. With this he hoped to clo&s;e the year. To reduce the city by &s;iege, would require a long time, (if not relieved) nor had he a train of artillery for the purpo&s;e. With this day would expire the time of &s;ervice of many of his troops. He therefore re&s;olved to attempt to carry the place by a&s;&s;ault. Two real attacks were to be made on the lower city, at the oppo&s;ite ends; one guided by him&s;elf, the other by Arnold; and there were to be two fal&s;e attacks made on the up|per city, to divide and di&s;tract the enemy. Every thing was well arranged. Arnold forced his way in, was wounded, and carried away&mdash;his party fighting on. Montgomery pa&s;&s;ed along a very narrow defile, next to the bank, to a barrier ob&s;tinately defended; and here he fell&mdash;here was an end to his attack. The other party fought on; but the&s;e being now the only enemy to oppo&s;e, the Briti&s;h turned their whole force to that quarter. They could not well retreat: the whole were killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oners. There was here barely a pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s, unle&s;s fortune &s;hould prove more favourable to merit than &s;he is wont to do. Nothing more could be done on the &s;core of gallantry. How far the attempt was a prudent one, is another que&s;tion. It is a mil|itary maxim, that "fortune may fail us, but a pru|dent conduct never will." At the &s;ame time, &s;ome of the mo&s;t brilliant victories have been obtained by a dating &s;troke.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="35">
18th.&mdash;Col. Knox, of the artillery, came to camp. He brought from Ticonderoga a fine train of artil|lery, which had been taken from the Briti&s;h, both cannon and mortars, and which were ordered to be &s;topped at Framingham.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Several Indians came to camp from the we&s;tward. Intelligence was received from Canada, that the blockade of Quebec was continued, not|with&s;tanding the rebuff on the morning of the 31&s;t of December.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;A number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers from Bunker's Hill, went to pulling down the tide-mill at Charle&s;town. A cannon was di&s;charged at them from Cobble Hill, which di&s;per&s;ed them for a &s;hort time, but they returned again.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Three cows were feeding near the Briti&s;h out-po&s;t at Charle&s;town neck. A party of the Briti&s;h came out, got above them, drove them to the neck, and killed them. This brought on a bri&s;k firing at the out-po&s;ts, and &s;ome cannon were di&s;charged from Bunker's Hill. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that the Briti&s;h had one man killed, and one wounded.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;At night, a party of Americans, from Win|ter Hill, went down and burnt the old tide-mill in Charle&s;town.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;In the morning, a party of Briti&s;h troops from the Ca&s;tle, and another from Bo&s;ton, cro&s;&s;ed over to Dorche&s;ter neck, with intent to &s;urpri&s;e the American guard, which they came well nigh effect|ing; the guard but ju&s;t e&s;caping them. There was but one mu&s;ket fired, on the &s;ide of the Americans. An old inhabitant and his &s;on were taken pri&s;oners. The Briti&s;h burnt the hou&s;es on the point, and then returned.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Canada, that &s;ome of the Briti&s;h garri&s;on of Quebec, having made a &s;ally, in order to get fuel, they were driven
<PB N="38" REF="36">
back, with the lo&s;s of twelve killed, and fifteen wounded.</P>
<P>The heights round Bo&s;ton, <HI>except tho&s;e at Dorche&s;|ter,</HI> having been taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, it was now de|termined that the&s;e al&s;o &s;hould be occupied; and great previous preparation was made for the purpo&s;e. It was imagined that &s;o near an approach to the Briti&s;h, would induce them to make a &s;ally, to di&s;|lodge the Americans. It was therefore deliberated in Council, that, in ca&s;e the Briti&s;h &s;hould come forth, a &s;trong detachment of Americans, from the Cambridge camp, in <HI>boats,</HI> &s;hould proceed down the river, and land at the bottom of the common, in Bo&s;ton. To this our General made a mo&s;t pointed oppo&s;ition; alleging, that it would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly produce only de&s;eat and di&s;grace to the American army; that the Briti&s;h General mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a ma&s;ter of his profe&s;&s;ion; that as &s;uch, he would fir&s;t provide for the defence of the town, in every part, which was the great depo&s;it of all his &s;tores; that when this was done, if his troops would afford a redundancy, &s;ufficient for a &s;ally, he might attempt it; but it was to be remembered that, at any rate, the town would be defended; that it was impo&s;&s;ible for troops, armed and di&s;ciplined as the Americans then were, to be pu&s;hed down in boats, at lea&s;t one mile and a half, open to the fire of all the Briti&s;h batteries on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town, and to their whole park of artillery, which might be drawn to the bottom of the common long before the Ameri|cans could reach it, and be flanked al&s;o by the works on the neck; that under &s;uch a tremendous fire, the troops could not effect a landing; and that he would never give his vote for it. It was however carried, that the attempt &s;hould be made.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;It being Lord's day, after public &s;ervice, a proclamation from the General A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;a.
<PB N="39" REF="37">
chu&s;etts, for the reformation of manners, was read to the fir&s;t divi&s;ion by the Rev. Mr. Leonard.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A picket of 60 men was ordered to Leech|more's Point; and Col. Sargent's regiment at In|man's farm was ordered to be in readine&s;s to &s;up|port them, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be attacked by the Briti&s;h; as &s;ome grounds for &s;u&s;pecting it had been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;En&s;ign Lyman, of Huntington's regiment, with a &s;mall party, took a Corporal and two men, who were centinels at Brown's chimneys, on Bo&s;ton neck, without firing a gun. The&s;e pri&s;oners report|ed, that the heavy cannon were removed from Bunk|er's Hill, and put on board &s;hip.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Some heavy cannon were mounted on the works at Leechmore's Point. The &s;ame day the Briti&s;h were bu&s;ily employed in erecting a work, a little to the north of the powder magazine in Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h threw &s;ome &s;hells to Leech|more's Point.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Several mortars were &s;ent over to Roxbury, and great preparations made to annoy the enemy. Bundles of &s;crewed hay were brought from Chel&s;ea, to be u&s;ed in the works.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;At night, a cannonade and bombardment began at the American works, on Cobble Hill and Leechmore's Point on the Cambridge &s;ide, and at Lamb's Dam on the Roxbury &s;ide, again&s;t the Brit|i&s;h works; and a number of &s;hells were thrown into Bo&s;ton. The Briti&s;h returned the fire, and threw out a number of &s;hells; one of which, of 13 inches, reached Pro&s;pect Hill. One of the American mor|tars of 13 inches, and two of 10 inches, were bur&s;t. They were not properly bedded, as the ground was hard frozen.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;There was an almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant roar of can|non and mortars during the night, on both &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="38">
The Americans took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights, and nearly completed their works on both the hills by morning. Perhaps there never was &s;o much work done in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time. The adjoining orchards were cut down to make the ab|battis; and a very curious and novel mode of de|fence was added to the&s;e works. The hills on which they were erected were &s;teep, and clear of trees and bu&s;hes. Rows of barrels, filled with earth, were placed round the works. They pre&s;ented only the appear|ance of &s;trengthening the works; but the real de&s;ign was, in ca&s;e the enemy made an attack, to have rolled them down the hill. They would have de&s;cended with &s;uch increa&s;ing velocity, as mu&s;t have thrown the a&s;&s;ailants into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and have killed and wounded great numbers. This project was &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. <HI>William Davis,</HI> merchant, of Bo&s;ton, to our General, who immediately communi|cated it to the Commander in Chief, who highly approved of it, as did all the other officers: But the credit of it is ju&s;tly due to Mr. <HI>Davis,</HI> and to him the writer gives it. As the regiments at Roxbury were parading, in the afternoon of this day, to march to Dorche&s;ter, a &s;hot, from the Briti&s;h lines on Bo&s;|ton neck, carried away a thigh of Lieut. John Mayo, of Learned's regiment: he &s;oon after died. One man was killed by a &s;hell at Leechmore's Point, in the night.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h, it was expected, would attempt to di&s;lodge the Americans from Dorche&s;ter heights. Signals had been prepared at Roxbury meeting-hou&s;e to mark the moment. The detachment at Cam|bridge (de&s;igned to pu&s;h into Bo&s;ton in the boats) was paraded, not far from No. 2, where it remained a good part of the day. But kind Heaven, which more than once &s;aved the Americans when they would have de&s;troyed them&s;elves, did not allow the
<PB N="41" REF="39">
&s;ignals to be made. About 3500 of the Briti&s;h troops, it was &s;aid, had been &s;ent down to the Ca&s;tle, with the intent to have made an attack on the Ameri|cans; but, about midnight, the wind blew almo&s;t a hurricane from the &s;outh; many windows were forced in, &s;heds and fences blown down, and &s;ome ve&s;&s;els drove on &s;hore; and no attempt was made on the works. <HI>Some</HI> were ready to blame our General, for the &s;entiments which he expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the go|ing into Bo&s;ton, as was propo&s;ed, in the boats, and attributed it to the want of &s;irmne&s;s: But the opin|ion of every <HI>military</HI> man, &s;ince that time, whether <HI>American, French,</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> who have taken a view of the land and water which was to have been the &s;cene of action, with the concomitant circum&s;tances, (as far as we have heard) hath been coincident; and tho&s;e who may in future review them, will for them|&s;elves determine, whether the <HI>independence of &s;pirit and &s;entiments</HI> of our General, expre&s;&s;ed on the oc|ca&s;ion, merited <HI>applau&s;e</HI> or <HI>cen&s;ure:</HI> For him&s;elf, he has been frequently heard to &s;ay that he <HI>gloried in them.</HI></P>
<P>On the night of the 7th, Capt. Erving made his e&s;cape out of Bo&s;ton. He reported, that the Briti&s;h were preparing to leave the town; that they were putting their cannon, mortars, &s;hot, &s;hells, &amp;c. on board the &s;tore-&s;hips; that &s;ome of the &s;hot and &s;hells, &s;ent into the town by the Americans, had been well directed.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;The Americans at Dorche&s;ter neck opened a battery to the north-ea&s;t of Bird's Hill, near the water, with the intent to annoy the Briti&s;h &s;hipping. This night a &s;trong detachment went down to open a work on Nook Hill in Dorche&s;ter, &s;till nearer to Bo&s;ton. Some of the men imprudently kindled a fire behind the hill, previous to the hour for break|ing of ground. The enemy di&s;covered the light
<PB N="42" REF="40">
of the fire; and there was, during the evening and night, a continual roar of cannon and mortars, from the Ca&s;tle and lines on Bo&s;ton neck, &s;outh end of that town; as well as from the Americans at Roxbury, Cobble Hill, and Leechmore's Point, at Cambridge. The &s;econd &s;hot from the Briti&s;h at the old fortification, &s;outh end of the town of Bo&s;|ton, killed 4 Americans, who were &s;tanding around the fire before mentioned, at Nook Hill; one of whom was Dr. Dow, of Connecticut. Another man was killed at the point next to the Ca&s;tle. This &s;u&s;pended the work for the night, during which more than 800 &s;hot were fired.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;The cannonade continued. The Briti&s;h were putting their cannon, military &s;tores, and bag|gage, on board the &s;tore-&s;hips and tran&s;ports. This evening two pieces of cannon, and two &s;mall mor|tars, were carried on to Noddle's I&s;land, to di&s;turb the Briti&s;h &s;hipping; but the enemy being quiet at their different works, they were not mole&s;ted from that quarter.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;In the evening there was a bri&s;k cannon|ade from the Briti&s;h, at the &s;outh end of Bo&s;ton, and the lines on the neck.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;A Mr. Woodward came out of Bo&s;ton. He reported that the Briti&s;h were making the great|e&s;t preparations to leave the town; that a num|ber of gun-carriages, ammunition-waggons, &amp;c. had been broken to pieces, and thrown off the wharves; that &s;ome furniture had been de&s;troyed, and that many dry goods had been &s;eized, &amp;c.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Six regiments of the American army, viz. Greaton's, Stark's, Patter&s;on's, Bond's, Webb's, and the rifle regiment, were put under orders to march for New-York; of the&s;e our General was to take the command. A detachment of artillery was al&s;o ordered to march with this brigade.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="41">
On the evening of the 15th, a fire broke out in Patter&s;on's barracks at Cambridge, which con&s;umed &s;ix rooms, de&s;troyed &s;ome mu&s;ket-cartridges, &amp;c. This day the rifle regiment commenced their march for New-York.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;In the morning the Briti&s;h evacuated Bo&s;|ton; their rear guard, with &s;ome marks of precipi|tation. A number of cannon were left &s;piked, and two large marine mortars, which they in vain at|tempted to bur&s;t. The garri&s;on at Bunker's Hill practi&s;ed &s;ome deception to cover their retreat. They fixed &s;ome images, repre&s;enting men, in the places of their centinels, with mu&s;kets placed on their &s;houl|ders, &amp;c. Their immoveable po&s;ition led to the di&s;|covery of the deception, and a detachment of the Americans marched in and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The troops on the Roxbury &s;ide, moved over the neck and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bo&s;ton; as did others from Cambridge, in boats. On the Americans entering the town, the inhabitants di&s;covered joy inexpre&s;&s;ible. The town had been much injured in its buildings, and &s;ome individuals had been plundered. Some Briti&s;h &s;tores were left. The Briti&s;h army went on board their tran&s;ports below the Ca&s;tle. A number of American adherents to them, and the Briti&s;h cau&s;e, went away with the army.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;The brigade de&s;tined for New-York, marched from the vincinity of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h blew up Ca&s;tle William, and burnt &s;ome of the barracks.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h cannonaded, from the Ca&s;tle, the Americans on Dorche&s;ter neck. The &s;ame morning our General left Roxbury for New-York. He reached Mendon, from whence, on the &s;ame evening, he ob&s;erved the light in the air of the fin|i&s;hing &s;troke of burning the barracks, &amp;c. at the Ca&s;tle. The Briti&s;h de&s;troyed the gun-carriages,
<PB N="44" REF="42">
and knocked the trunnions off the cannon, and left them &s;piked. The cannon were afterwards drilled free, and mounted on a new con&s;truction, in &s;tocks, placed on carriages, and were thereby rendered &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Our General reached Norwich in Connect|icut. The troops marched with great expedition; but by the badne&s;s of the roads, the fro&s;t then com|ing out of the ground, the baggage-waggons moved heavily. The tran&s;ports, de&s;tined for the troops, were fitting for &s;ea.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;They &s;ell down to New-London.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The troops were marched to that place, where they embarked, and came to &s;ail about noon.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;They arrived at Turtle Bay, di&s;embarked, and marched into the city at noon. The tran&s;|ports fell down to the city wharves, and landed the baggage, &amp;c. Gen. Thomp&s;on and Lord Sterling, with &s;ome New-York and New-Jer&s;ey troops, were in the city; and works were con|&s;tructing, in and around the city, on Long-I&s;land, and at Horn's Hook; the command of the whole devolved on our General. The A&s;ia, Briti&s;h man|of-war, then lay off in the harbour, with the Lady Gage, of 20 guns; but, on the arrival of the brig|ade; the A&s;ia moved further down, ju&s;t out of &s;hot. Our General put a &s;top to the intercour&s;e between the inhabitants and the &s;hips, which had, until then, been kept up.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2d.&mdash;Major D'Hart, of the Jer&s;ey troops, with 200 men, about midnight, made a de&s;cent on a &s;mall i&s;land in the harbour, which the Briti&s;h had begun to fortify; burnt a building or two, took two mu&s;kets, &s;ome entrenching tools, and came off. The A&s;ia fired &s;everal cannon, but did no harm.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 3d, Maj. Gen. Putnam arriv|ed at New-York, to whom the command fell. About
<PB N="45" REF="43">
this time, a ve&s;&s;el arrived from France, with a large quantity of gun-powder.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;A barge from one of the &s;hips going near Staten-I&s;land, was fired upon by the Americans: two men were killed, the barge and 8 men taken. The Briti&s;h cannonaded the &s;hore for &s;ome time, and one American was wounded.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Commodore Hopkins had fallen in with the Briti&s;h frigate Gla&s;gow, a bomb brig, and two tenders, and after a &s;mart engagement, took the brig and two tenders. The Gla&s;gow made off.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Gen. Sullivan's brigade arrived from the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;There were 18 pieces of bra&s;s cannon in the American park, at New-York, which were view|ed with no &s;mall degree of pride and wonder.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;In the forenoon, Gen. Wa&s;hington arriv|ed in the city, attended by Gen. Gates and &s;everal other officers.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h men-of-war were all out of the bay. The A&s;ia fell below the Narrows; the Phe|nix and others went out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Four American regiments, viz. Poor's, Patter&s;on's, Greaton's, and Bond's, were ordered for Canada; Gen. Thomp&s;on was to command them. Gen. Thomas had been, &s;ome time before, &s;ent from Bo&s;ton to command in Canada.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Gen. Greene's brigade arrived at New-York, as did a part of Spencer's. Mrs. Wa&s;hington arrived the &s;ame day in the city.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;The regiments de&s;tined for Canada, &s;ailed for Albany.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Six more regiments were ordered for Canada, viz. two from the Penn&s;ylvania line, two from the New-Jer&s;ey, and two from the New-Hamp|&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="44">
27th.&mdash;Our General, having been inoculated with the &s;mall-pox, went to Montre&s;os I&s;land, where he went through the operation of that di&s;temper.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 8th.&mdash;An expre&s;s arrived from Bo&s;ton, with an account, that a number of Briti&s;h tran&s;ports had arrived in Nanta&s;ket Road, with troops on board. All the American regiments at New-York were or|dered to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s, to march at a moment's notice. Several &s;oldiers were taken down with the &s;mall-pox, and &s;ome of them died.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Our General having recovered from the &s;mall-pox, which had been pretty &s;evere, returned to the city, and took the command of his brigade; and was the next day General of the day.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;A large &s;hip and two tenders arrived at the Narrows. A great number of works were now con|&s;tructing, and in good forwardne&s;s. A &s;trong work was rai&s;ed at Paulus Hook, on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide of the Hud&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 4th.&mdash;A French ve&s;&s;el, with We&s;t-India goods, arrived in the harbour.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that two Philadel|phia privateers had taken two rich Jamaicamen, la|den with &s;ugars, &amp;c. and &s;ome plate on board.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Unfavourable news was received from Can|ada. The &s;mall-pox, which was raging in the Amer|ican army, in that quarter, had carried off Gen. Thomas; and that Col. Beadle and Major Sher|burne, with the detachments under their command, were taken pri&s;oners, at or near a place called <HI>The Cedars.</HI> The army in New-York was now growing &s;ickly; and there was not a &s;ufficiency of ho&s;pital room, or of medicines.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Congre&s;s gave intimations, that General Howe, with the Briti&s;h army under his command, might be &s;oon expected at New-York. Some per|&s;ons, &s;u&s;pected of treacherous de&s;igns, were &s;eized and confined.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45">
15th.&mdash;Some intelligence, more favourable than the former, was received from Canada. The Ca|nadians were friendly. Gen. Sullivan, who was now in that quarter, having gone from New-York, with the reinforcement heretofore mentioned, was fortifying; the enemy were advancing; but Gen. Thomp&s;on was &s;ent out to oppo&s;e them. This, however, proved ineffectual; Thomp&s;on was defeat|ed and taken pri&s;oner. A number of Scotch troops, with Col. Campbell, had been made pri&s;oners, near Bo&s;ton harbour.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;The Penn&s;ylvania regiments, commanded by Colonels Shee and Magaw, were arriving in the city; they had the appearance of fine troops. The day before, Gen. Woo&s;ter arrived from Canada.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Gen. Gates, who was made a Major-Gen|eral, was to proceed immediately to Canada, where he was to take the command.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;A plot was di&s;covered in the city; it was to have bur&s;t on the Commander in Chief, and oth|ers. The Mayor of the city was taken into cu&s;tody, as was a gun-&s;mith; and &s;ome of the General's own guard, who were foreigners, were &s;aid to be in the plot. The &s;ame day, more particulars were received from Bo&s;ton; that the troops at Bo&s;ton had driv|en the King's &s;hips from the Lower Harbour, and taken &s;everal tran&s;ports, with Scotch &s;oldiers on board.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in, from the Liverpool man-of-war. They reported, that the fleet from Halifax, with Gen. Howe's army, were hourly ex|pected to arrive at New-York. Every exertion was now in exerci&s;e, to complete the works, and to ob|&s;truct the river. The latter was near Fort Wa&s;h|ington, and pro&s;ecuted by &s;inking a number of large hulks, and frames called <HI>chevaux-de-fri&s;e,</HI> compo&s;ed of large and long timbers framed together, with
<PB N="48" REF="46">
points elevated, to pierce and &s;top the way of ve&s;&s;els meeting of them. The&s;e were boxed at the bottom, to contain a va&s;t weight of &s;tones, which were put into them, and with which they &s;unk. A line of the&s;e, and hulks, was formed acro&s;s the river; &s;ome of them &s;unk very well; others, rather irregular; and &s;ome of the hulks, which were &s;trapped together with large timbers, &s;eparated in going down. A pa&s;|&s;age was left open for ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s through; and the Briti&s;h, as it was proved afterwards, found the means of knowing where it was, and of pa&s;&s;ing through it.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Gen. Bur|goyne had arrived in Canada, with a &s;trong rein|forcement. The militia were called in, to reinforce the army at New-York.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;One Thomas Hickey, a private &s;oldier in the General's guard, was executed. He was found guilty of mutiny, &s;edition, and the wor&s;t of practices, as it was expre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ame day, the Briti&s;h fleet arrived at Sandy Hook.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;The tran&s;ports were coming in, during the whole day. At evening, nearly 100 &s;ail had arrived. Col. Durkee's regiment was ordered over to Paulus Hook. The General Officers were in council.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Mrs. Wa&s;hington left the city.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2d.&mdash;Between 10 and 11 o'clock, A. M. four Briti&s;h men-of-war, and &s;everal tenders, came through the Narrows, and anchored near the watering-place on Staten-I&s;land. In the afternoon, they cannonaded towards the i&s;land. A little before &s;un-&s;etting, about 40 &s;ail of tran&s;ports came up to the &s;hips of war. The Americans lay on their arms, during the night.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;The Briti&s;h troops landed on Staten-I&s;land. A part of the &s;tock had been taken off. The inhab|itants, who were about 350 men, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be generally oppo&s;ed to the revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="47">
9th.&mdash;At evening roll-call, the declaration of the Congre&s;s, declaring the United Colonies <HI>FREE, SOVE|REIGN, AND INDEPENDENT STATES,</HI> was publi&s;hed at the head of the re&s;pective brigades, in camp, and received with loud huzzas.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Two Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, the Phenix and Ro&s;e, and three tenders, at about 4 o'clock, P. M. taking the advantage of the tide and a fre&s;h breeze, came up from the fleet, and pa&s;&s;ed the city up the Hud&s;on. A bri&s;k cannonade took place from Red Hook, Governor's I&s;land, Paulus Hook, and all the batteries on the North River &s;ide. The &s;hips were &s;everal times &s;truck by the &s;hot, but received no ma|terial damage. The &s;hips returned the fire, as they pa&s;&s;ed the batteries; and the encampment of our General's brigade, (the right flank of which being Col. Shepard's regiment) was on the bank of the river. The tents were &s;truck, and dropped on the ground, before the &s;hips came a-brea&s;t of them. Several &s;hot fell on the encampment, and one en|tered the embra&s;ure of a &s;mall redoubt, on the flank of the encampment, and &s;truck in the banquette on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the redoubt, between the legs of two &s;oliders, but did no damage. Several American artilleri&s;ts were killed and wounded, by the bur&s;ting of &s;ome of our own cannon. The &s;hips ran nearly up to Tappan Bay, and came to anchor.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;A Briti&s;h officer came up with a flag, with a letter to Gen. Wa&s;hington; but the letter not be|ing properly addre&s;&s;ed, it was not received. The &s;ame day, a flag was &s;ent by Lord Howe to Amboy, with &s;undry letters, directed to the chief magi&s;trates of &s;everal of the Colonies, and a declaration, offer|ing the King's pardon to &s;uch Colonies, towns, or boroughs, as &s;hould &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's laws, &amp;c. Lord and Gen. Howe were Commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed to receive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="48">
16th.&mdash;Another flag came up from Lord Howe, with a letter directed to George Wa&s;hington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which was likewi&s;e rejected, for the want of a proper direction.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;In the morning, one or two of the Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;ailed out through the Narrows; and it was conjectured that a number &s;ailed out during the night. The Briti&s;h &s;hips which had &s;ailed up the Hud&s;on, had moved higher up. The Connecticut light-hor&s;e, which had come out to reinforce the ar|my, were returning home.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;A flag from Gen. Howe, with Adj. Gen. Patter&s;on, came up with a me&s;&s;age to Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton, re&s;pecting the recent capitulation in Canada, and in&s;inuating that Gen. Howe was de&s;irous, if po&s;|&s;ible, to bring about an accommodation. The &s;ame day, news was received from South-Carolina, that the Briti&s;h, in attempting Sullivan's I&s;land, with their &s;hips and a large body of troops, &s;aid to be from 1300 to 2000, were defeated by the Americans; one frigate burnt and blown up, &s;everal others dam|aged, and 172 men killed and wounded. On the &s;ide of the Americans, 10 were &s;aid to be killed, and 22 wounded.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A man, dre&s;&s;ed in woman's clothes, was taken up, in attempting to get to the Briti&s;h fleet: he was committed to pri&s;on. The &s;ame day, Gen. Sulli|van arrived from Canada. About noon, a number of cannon and &s;mall-arms were heard towards Eliz|abeth-Town.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;A row-galley or two, arrived from Con|necticut; and fire-&s;hips, rafts, &amp;c. were preparing with great expedition.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h &s;hips up the river fell &s;ome di&s;tance lower down</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;A regiment of militia, under the command of Col. Holman, arrived from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="49">
28th.&mdash;Two row-gallies moved up the Hud&s;on.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Col. Sargent's regiment of Continental troops arrived at Horn's Hook, from Bo&s;ton, and Col. Hutchin&s;on's from the &s;ame place. Several Briti&s;h &s;hips arrived and joined the fleet.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Dunmore, with his fleet, had got nearly 200 miles up Potowmack River in Virginia; that he had burnt one hou&s;e, and was within about 30 miles of Gen. Wa&s;hington's &s;eat.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;About 30 &s;ail of Briti&s;h &s;hips arriv|ed at the Hook. Three or four more row-gallies went up the Hud&s;on. In bringing the hulks, <HI>chev|aux-de-fri&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. round from the Ea&s;t River, to the Hud&s;on, a &s;loop &s;unk, not far from the Grand Battery.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Glover's regiment arrived from the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;About noon there was a bri&s;k cannonade up the Hud&s;on, between the American row-gallies and the Briti&s;h &s;hips: the former had two men killed; two mortally, and 12 &s;lightly wounded. The Brit|i&s;h lo&s;s was not known.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;There were &s;ome movements among the Briti&s;h fleet: the men-of-war appeared to be formed in line. Two de&s;erters came in, who reported that an attack on the Americans was intended &s;oon.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;A row-galley and two fire-&s;loops went up the river. It was intended to attempt burning the Briti&s;h &s;hips in Tappan Bay. The American army was now very &s;ickly; four &s;oldiers were buried on this day, from our General's brigade only. About, and a <HI>little after</HI> this time, the army was more &s;ick|ly than at any other period. The new&s;papers at Philadelphia and Bo&s;ton, rated the army at 70,000 &s;trong, and in high &s;pirits, and that they would &s;oon clear the enemy from America. This was not a little mortifying to Gen. Wa&s;hington, who had the evidence, that the army did not exceed 40,000, of|ficers
<PB N="52" REF="50">
included; and a large portion of the&s;e were levies and militia, called out for &s;hort periods, and unacquainted with a camp life. Hence the number of &s;ick amounted to near 10,000; nor was it po&s;&s;ible to find proper ho&s;pitals or proper nece&s;&s;aries for them. In almo&s;t every barn, &s;table, &s;hed, and even under the fences and bu&s;hes, were the &s;ick to be &s;een, who&s;e countenances were but an index of the dejec|tion of &s;pirit, and the di&s;tre&s;s they endured.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;It was learnt that the Briti&s;h were prepar|ing for an attack, and were putting their heavy artil|lery, &amp;c. on board &s;hip.</P>
<P>In reconnoitring the po&s;ition of New-York, long before this time, all were agreed, that the upper end of the i&s;land, and above King&s;bridge, mu&s;t be &s;e|cured, or there could be no &s;ecurity to an army on the i&s;land; but there was &s;ome difference in opinion as to the place. A commanding height, near Morris's hou&s;e, &s;ome di&s;tance below the bridge, within the i&s;land, was thought by &s;ome, among whom was Gen. Putnam, a po&s;ition which, if properly fortified, would be almo&s;t impregnable. While others, among whom was our General, and his brother Gen. Greene, who were generally in &s;entiment, in&s;i&s;ted that there could be no &s;ecurity on the i&s;land, although the po&s;t before mentioned was made as &s;trong as Gibralter, if the heights above the bridge were left unfortified, as the enemy might at any time, in an hour or two, po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of tho&s;e heights above the bridge, and completely entrap the army; and each declared po&s;|itively, that he would not re&s;t ea&s;y or &s;atisfied, until tho&s;e grounds were taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. Fort Wa&s;h|ington was begun on the hill fir&s;t mentioned, and the works were pu&s;hed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; and it was determined to erect another fort above the bridge, which was al&s;o begun, and called Independence. Every exertion was now in exerci&s;e to complete the
<PB N="53" REF="51">
works in and about the city, &s;ome of which were &s;trong. Indeed, immen&s;e labour had been be&s;tow|ed on the works at the city, on Long-I&s;land, at Horn's Hook, near Hell Gate, and at Paulus Hook, on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, oppo&s;ite the city, on Governor's I&s;land, &amp;c.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Our General received a commi&s;&s;ion from Congre&s;s, dated the 9th, appointing him a Major-General in the army of the United States of Ameri|ca. Generals Spencer, Sullivan and Green, receiv|ed, at the &s;ame time, commi&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame tenor.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;In the afternoon, 30 or 40 Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els came through the Narrows, and joined the fleet.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;A number more of &s;hips, &s;ome of them very large, came in and joined the fleet: the &s;hips up the river fell a little lower down.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Our General rode to Horn's Hook and King&s;bridge. The per&s;on who had the direction of the fire-ve&s;&s;els, reque&s;ted him to be a &s;pectator on the bank of the river, of an attempt, intended to be made on that night, to burn the &s;hips. Attended by Gen. Clinton, and &s;everal other officers, they waited on the bank until about midnight; but no attempt on the &s;hips was made, and they returned di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Our General was again reque&s;ted to be a &s;pectator on the bank of the river, the approaching night, with the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances that he &s;hould not be again di&s;appointed: he accordingly went, at|tended as on the preceding time, and took a proper po&s;ition on the bank. The night was pretty dark; they &s;oon found that the gallies and fire-ve&s;&s;els were &s;ilently moving up, with the tide. After &s;ome time, and almo&s;t immediately after the centinels, on board the Briti&s;h &s;hips, had pa&s;&s;ed the word, <HI>"all is well,"</HI> two of the fire-ve&s;&s;els fla&s;hed into a blaze; the one, clo&s;e on the &s;ide of the Phenix, the other grappling

one of the tenders. To appearance, the flames were again&s;t the &s;ide of the Phenix; and there was much confu&s;ion on board. A number of cannon were di&s;|charged into the fire-ve&s;&s;el, in order to &s;ink her. A number of &s;eamen a&s;cended, and got out on the yard|arm, &s;uppo&s;ed to clear away &s;ome grapplings. The fire-ve&s;&s;el was along &s;ide, as was judged, near ten minutes, when the Phenix either cut, or &s;lipt her ca|ble, let fall her fore-top&s;ail, wore round, and &s;tood up the river, being immediately veiled from the &s;pec|tators, by the darkne&s;s of the night. The tender burnt down to the water's edge, and was towed to the &s;hore by the Americans; out of which was tak|en, one iron &s;ix-pounder, two three-pounders, one two-pounder, ten &s;wivels, a caboo&s;e, &s;ome gun-bar|rels, cutla&s;&s;es, grapplings, chains, &amp;c. The Ro&s;e, and the other two tenders, remained at their moorings; but it was &s;aid that one of the tenders was de&s;erted by her crew, for a time. Several of our gallies were &s;aid to have been inactive; otherwi&s;e, a very con&s;id|erable advantage would have been reaped. The Americans &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s or injury, &s;aving one man, who, in communicating fire to one of the ve&s;&s;els, got con&s;iderably burnt in the face, hands, &amp;c.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief, having ordered our General to take the command of the troops and po&s;ts, at the north end of the i&s;land, and above King&s;bridge, within which command fell the Forts Wa&s;hington and Independence, and a number of other works, he took the command accordingly.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Very early in the morning, the wind be|ing pretty fre&s;h, and it being very rainy, the &s;hips and tenders which were up the river, got under &s;ail, and ran down, keeping as clo&s;e under the ea&s;t bank as they could, in pa&s;&s;ing our works. They were, however, bri&s;kly cannonaded at Fort Wa&s;hington; and the works below were &s;everal times &s;truck, but
<PB N="55" REF="53">
received no material damage. They joined their fleet near Staten-I&s;land.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;It was made pretty certain, that the Brit|i&s;h were upon the point of making an attack &s;ome|where. By an expre&s;s, which our General received from Gen. Wa&s;hington, at half pa&s;t 2 o'clock, A. M. of the 22d, he was plea&s;ed to communicate, that, by intelligence which he had received, the enemy had intentions of making attacks on Long-I&s;land, up the North River, upon Bergen Point, Elizabeth-Town Point, Amboy, &amp;c. Perhaps &s;o many places were mentioned, in order to divide the force of, and di&s;|tract the Americans. On this morning, however, they landed, near Grave&s;end Bay, on Long I&s;land, about 8,000 men; Col. Hand, with his rifle corps, retreating moderately before them, and de&s;troying &s;ome wheat which would fall into their hands. The Briti&s;h advanced as far as Flatbu&s;h, where they halt|ed. Six American regiments were &s;ent over, as a reinforcement. Gen. Sullivan had the command on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;There were &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes on Long-I&s;l|and; but nothing very material.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;A number of the enemy's &s;hips fell down towards the Narrows; it was &s;uppo&s;ed, with intent to land more troops on Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;In the morning, a bri&s;k cannonade on Long-I&s;land, for &s;ome time. The Briti&s;h had thrown up &s;ome works, at Flatbu&s;h, from which they fired at the Americans.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Early in the morning, two &s;hips and a brig came to anchor a little above Frog Point. Our General immediately detached Col. Graham with his regiment, to prevent their landing to plunder or burn. Before he arrived, &s;everal barges full of men landed on New City I&s;land, and killed a num|ber of cattle. Two companies of the regiment, im|mediately
<PB N="56" REF="54">
on their arrival, ferried over to the i&s;land. The enemy carried off one man and 14 cattle&mdash;the remainder of the cattle were &s;ecured.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, there was a mo&s;t bloody battle on Long-I&s;land, between the Americans and the Briti&s;h. The Briti&s;h, by a long circuitous march in the night of the 26th; with a part of their army, found the left of the Americans not &s;o well &s;ecured as it ought to have been; and they had an oppor|tunity to reach ground, which gave them great ad|vantage, while it equally expo&s;ed the Americans in the &s;trong grounds towards Flatbu&s;h. There was here al&s;o another circum&s;tance of ground, which now proved very di&s;advantageous to the Americans. There was a con&s;iderable mar&s;h, into which a creek ran, and on which there was a mill, known by the name of M'Gowen's. At the mill there was a pa&s;s|way over; but unluckily, when <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Ameri|cans had retreated by this mill, (for they were &s;oon routed by the Briti&s;h, who formed an attack almo&s;t in a &s;emi-circle) it was &s;et on fire. This would have been a politic &s;tep, had <HI>all</HI> the Americans on the other &s;ide, in that quarter, previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed; but tho&s;e &s;till beyond the creek were now driven to al|mo&s;t de&s;perate circum&s;tances: they could not pa&s;s at the head of the creek; for the Briti&s;h column, which made the circuitous movement, were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground on the left; con&s;equently, many were here killed or taken pri&s;oners, and num|bers peri&s;hed in attempting to get over the creek, &s;ome of them &s;ticking in the mud. Tho&s;e who e&s;|caped retreated to the American works. The Brit|i&s;h &s;u&s;tained a con&s;iderable lo&s;s in killed and wound|ed, and a &s;ubaltern and 23 men were taken pri&s;on|ers; but the American lo&s;s was far greater, in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners. Among the latter were Gen. Sullivan and Lord Sterling. Several field-
<PB N="57" REF="55">
pieces were al&s;o lo&s;t. At evening, the Briti&s;h army encamped in front of the Americans.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 28th, there was a &s;kirmi&s;h between the Americans and Briti&s;h, which terminat|ed rather in favour of the former. The &s;ame night, the Briti&s;h began to open works, at the di&s;tance of about 600 yards from the American works on the left. Gen. Wa&s;hington wrote to our General, to &s;end down to the city all the boats that could be &s;pared, from King&s;bridge and Fort Wa&s;hington; in|timating, that he might po&s;&s;ibly find it nece&s;&s;ary, at night, to throw over more troops to Long-I&s;land. This order was immediately complied with, and the boats &s;ent down; while the real intention of their u&s;e was fully under&s;tood.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;The &s;hips in the Ea&s;t River fell down to Hunt's Point. On the &s;ame night, the Americans evacuated Long-I&s;land, bringing off their military &s;tores, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. Some heavy cannon were left. In this retreat from the i&s;land, and which was well conducted, an in&s;tance of di&s;cipline and of true fortitude was exhibited by the American guards and pickets. In order that the Briti&s;h &s;hould not get knowledge of the withdraw of the Americans, until their main body had embarked in the boats and pu&s;hed off from the &s;hore, (which was a matter of the highe&s;t importance to their &s;afety) the guards were ordered to continue at their re&s;pective po&s;ts, with centinels alert, as if nothing extraordinary was taking place, until the troops had embarked: they were then to come off, march bri&s;kly to the ferry, and embark them&s;elves. But, &s;omehow or other, the guards came off, and had got well toward the landing-place, when they were ordered to face about, march back, and re-occupy their former po&s;ts; which they in&s;tantly obeyed, and continued at them, until called off to cro&s;s the ferry. Whoever has
<PB N="58" REF="56">
&s;een troops in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, or duly contem|plates the human heart in &s;uch trials, well know how to appreciate the conduct of the&s;e brave men, on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;In the forenoon, the Briti&s;h appeared at Newton, where they pitched a number of tents. Governor's I&s;land was evacuated the preceding night by the Americans. It was now evident, that the next object of the enemy would be to get the city; and it was equally &s;o, that they would land &s;ome|where on the i&s;land without it. This night, &s;everal of the regiments of Gen. Mi&s;&s;lin's brigade, of our General's divi&s;ion, lay on the hills towards New-York; and Gen. Clinton's brigade on their arms. The &s;ame evening, Hand's, Shee's, Magaw's, Broad|head's, and Miles's battalions, joined our General's divi&s;ion. Some of the&s;e corps had &s;uffered greatly, in the action on Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;The Briti&s;h appeared to be en|camped in &s;everal places on Long-I&s;land. They had run a &s;hip in between Nutten I&s;land and Red Hook.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;They ran a &s;hip pa&s;t the city up the Ea&s;t River: &s;he was &s;everal times &s;truck by the &s;hot of a 12 pounder, which was drawn to the river's bank. Major Crane, of the artillery, was wounded in the foot, by a cannon &s;hot from this &s;hip. It was now a que&s;tion, whether to defend the city, or evacuate it, and occupy the &s;trong grounds above. Every exer|tion had been made, to render the works both nu|merous and &s;trong; and immen&s;e labour and expen&s;e had been be&s;towed on them; and it was now deter|mined that the city &s;hould be ob&s;tinately defended.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington came up, and dined at our General's quarters. The &s;ame day, a detach|ment of the artillery, with one 24 pounder, three 12 pounders, three 3 pounders, and a howitzer,
<PB N="59" REF="57">
joined the divi&s;ion. The enemy were plundering cattle on Long-I&s;land, now fully in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Our General ordered a chain of videtts and centinels to be formed at Morri&s;&s;ania, Hunt's and Frog's Point, &amp;c. The Briti&s;h were pre&s;&s;ing a great number of teams on Long-I&s;land&mdash;their Head-Quar|ters were at Bedford.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;The militia on Long-I&s;land were ordered to mu&s;ter, to rai&s;e recruits for the King. The Gen|eral Officers of the American army were in coun|cil, at Head-Quarters in New-York. The Briti&s;h were now erecting a work, nearly oppo&s;ite to our's at Horn's Hook, and the di&s;tance not great.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h opened their battery again&s;t Horn's Hook Fort. The fire was bri&s;kly returned. The Americans had one man killed, and two wounded.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;In the morning there was a bri&s;k cannonade on both &s;ides. At Horn's Hook, the American ar|tillery was &s;o well plied, that the Briti&s;h cea&s;ed firing. The Briti&s;h were &s;aid to be encamped in three divi&s;ions; one at Newton, which was Head-Quarters, one at Flu&s;hing, and one at Jamaica.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h landed a number of troops on Montre&s;ors I&s;land.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h continued to cannonade and bombard our fort at Horn's Hook, and to land more troops on Montre&s;ors I&s;land.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;The cannonade continued again&s;t our fort at Horn's Hook, and the Briti&s;h were moving their troops towards the Ea&s;t River. This day, Col. Ward's regiment of Connecticut troops removed from Burditt's Ferry, and joined our General's di|vi&s;ion. The General Officers were in council. A former re&s;olution to defend the city was re&s;cinded, with three di&s;&s;entients.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Four Briti&s;h &s;hips, one of which was a two-decker, ran by the city up the Ea&s;t River. The
<PB N="60" REF="58">
cannonade and bombardment at Horn's Hook con|tinued. This evening, Col. Che&s;ter, with five regi|ments, joined our General's divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h &s;ent three or four &s;hips up the North River, as far as Greenwich. The cannon and &s;tores were removing from New-York, during the night.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;About noon, the Briti&s;h landed at Kepps's Bay. They met with but &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance, and pu&s;h|ed towards the city, of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the afternoon. They availed them&s;elves of &s;ome cannon and &s;tores; but their booty was not very great. Here the Americans, we are &s;orry to &s;ay, did not behave well; and here it was, as fame hath &s;aid, that Gen. Wa&s;hington threw his hat on the ground, and exclaimed, "Are the&s;e the men with which I am to defend America?" But &s;everal things may have weight here;&mdash;the wounds received on Long-I&s;land were yet bleeding; and the officers, if not the men, knew that the city was not to be de|fended. Maj. Chapman was killed, and Brig. Maj. Wyllis was taken pri&s;oner. A few others were kill|ed, wounded, and taken pri&s;oners. The Americans retreated up the i&s;land; and &s;ome few, who could not get out of the city that way, e&s;caped in boats over to Paulus Hook, acro&s;s the river. The hou&s;e, in the fort at Horn's Hook, was &s;et on fire by a &s;hell, and burnt down. The fort was afterwards abandoned.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;A little before noon, a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h hap|pened on the heights we&s;t of Haarlem Plain, and &s;outh of Morris's hou&s;e, between a party of He&s;&s;ian Yagers, Briti&s;h Light-Infantry and Highlanders, and the American riflemen and &s;ome other troops, which ended in favour of the latter. The troops fought well, on both &s;ides, and gave great proof of their mark&s;man&s;hip. The Americans had &s;everal of|ficers killed and wounded; among the former, Lieut.
<PB N="61" REF="59">
Col. Knoulton, of the Connecticut line, and Capt. Glea&s;on, of Nixon's Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiment, two ex|cellent officers; and Maj. Beech, of one of the &s;outh|ern regiments, a brave officer, was among the latter. This &s;kirmi&s;h might have brought on a general ac|tion; for both armies were then within &s;upporting di&s;tance of the troops which were engaged.</P>
<P>It now became an object of high importance, to calculate, if po&s;&s;ible, where the Briti&s;h would make their next attempt; and here the General Officers were divided in opinion. A part of them imagined, that the Briti&s;h would fir&s;t endeavour to make them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole of New-York I&s;land, and that, therefore, the reduction of Fort Wa&s;hington, and its dependencies, would be their object. Others &s;uppo&s;ed, that they would make a landing either at Morri&s;&s;ania, Hunt's or Frog's Point, which eventu|ally would produce as certain a reduction of the works on the i&s;land, with very little lo&s;s to the Brit|i&s;h. It was therefore determined in council, to guard again&s;t both; and for this purpo&s;e, 10,000 men were to be retained on the i&s;land, at and near Fort Wa&s;hington. Our General's divi&s;ion was to be aug|mented to 10,000 men, and a floating bridge was to be thrown acro&s;s Haarlem Creek, that the&s;e two bod|ies might communicate with and &s;upport each other, as circum&s;tances might require; and Major-Gen. Greene was to command the flying camp on the Jer|&s;ey &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, which was to con&s;i&s;t of 5,000. The different arrangements took place accordingly.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The remains of Lieut. Col. Knoulton were interred with military honours. The &s;ame day, a troop of militia light-hor&s;e arrived from Connecti|cut; others, and many of the militia were on their way to join the army.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Gen. Par&s;ons's and Scott's brigades, and the brigade commanded by Col. Dudley Sargent,
<PB N="62" REF="60">
joined our General's divi&s;ion; and Shee's, Magaw's, Ha&s;lett's, Atlee's, and Broadhead's battalions were ordered away. The Briti&s;h army encamped between the American army and the city.</P>
<P>A picket from our General's divi&s;ion, of 450 men, con&s;tantly mounted, by relief, at Morri&s;&s;ania; from which a chain of centinels, within half gun|&s;hot of each other, were planted, from the one &s;ide of the &s;hore to the other, and near the water pa&s;&s;age, between Morri&s;&s;ania and Montre&s;ors I&s;land, which in &s;ome places is very narrow. The centinels on the American &s;ide were ordered not to pre&s;ume to fire at tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h, unle&s;s the latter began; but the Briti&s;h were &s;o fond of beginning, that there was frequently a firing between them. This having been the ca&s;e one day, and a Briti&s;h officer walking along the bank, on the Montre&s;ors &s;ide, an American centinel, who had been exchanging &s;ome &s;hots with a Briti&s;h centinel, &s;eeing the officer, and concluding him to be better game, gave him a &s;hot, and wounded him. He was carried up to the hou&s;e on the i&s;land, An officer, with a flag, &s;oon came down to the creek, and called for the American officer of the picket, and informed him, that if the American centinels fired any more, the commanding-officer on the i&s;land would cannonade Col. Morris's hou&s;e, in which the officers of the picket quartered. The American officer immediately &s;ent up to our General, to know what an&s;wer &s;hould be returned. He was directed to inform the Briti&s;h officer, that the American centi|nels had always been in&s;tructed not to fire on <HI>centi|nels,</HI> unle&s;s they were fir&s;t fired upon, and then to return the fire; that &s;uch would be their conduct: as to the cannonading of Col. Morris's hou&s;e, they might act their plea&s;ure. The firing cea&s;ed for &s;ome time; but a raw Scotch centinel, having been planted, one day, he very &s;oon after di&s;charged his piece at an
<PB N="63" REF="61">
American centinel, neare&s;t to him, which was im|mediately returned; upon which a Briti&s;h officer came down, and called to the American officers, ob|&s;erving that he thought there was to be no firing be|tween the centinels. He was an&s;wered, that their own began; upon which he replied, "He &s;hall then pay for it." The centinel was directly after relieved, and there was no firing between the centinels, at that place, any more; and they were &s;o civil to each oth|er, on their po&s;ts, that one day, at a part of the creek where it was practicable, the Briti&s;h centinel a&s;ked the American, who was nearly oppo&s;ite to him, if he could give him a chew of tobacco: the latter, having in his pocket a piece of a thick twi&s;ted roll, &s;ent it acro&s;s the creek, to the Briti&s;h centinel, who, after taking off his bite, &s;ent the remainder back again.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief, Maj. Gen. Put|nam, and &s;ome other officers, came up to our Gen|eral's divi&s;ion, and rode round the camp, which, by the return, given in on the next day, con&s;i&s;ted of 8,771; but of the&s;e there was 1,294 &s;ick pre&s;ent, and 1,108 &s;ick ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 21&s;t, between one and two o'clock, the light of a great fire was di&s;covered to the &s;outhward, which proved to be at New-York; when a con&s;iderable part of the city was con&s;umed.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Two &s;eamen, belonging to the La Brune, a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war, which lay near Montre&s;ors I&s;land, de&s;erted, and came to our General's quarters; and informed him, upon examination, that the Brit|i&s;h had then but a few men on the i&s;land, &s;tating the number; that the piece of cannon, which had been put on the i&s;land, was taken back again, on board the La Brune; that there were a number of officers at the hou&s;e, in which there was a con&s;iderable quantity of baggage depo&s;ited, &amp;c. Our General &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e troops might be ea&s;ily taken;
<PB N="64" REF="62">
and, having called the General Officers of his divi&s;|ion together, took their opinion, who all coincided with him in &s;entiment. He then communicated his intention to the Commander in Chief, who gave it his approbation. Two hundred and forty men were de&s;tined for this enterpri&s;e: the command was giv|en to Lieut. Col. Michael Jack&s;on, of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts line, with Majors Logan and&mdash;, who&s;e name cannot be recollected, of the New-York troops. They were to embark on board three flat-boats, cov|ered by a fourth with a detachment of artillery, with a light three-pounder, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be found nec|e&s;&s;ary in retreating from the i&s;land. The mode of at|tack was &s;ettled, and every circum&s;tance &s;ecured, to promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s. They were to fall down Haarlem Creek with the ebb. The time was &s;o calculated, that the young flood was to be &s;o much made, at the break of day, as to cover the flats at the i&s;land, &s;uf|ficiently for the boats to float. Matters being thus &s;ettled, our General ordered the two &s;ailors to be brought in: he then told them, that in con&s;equence of their information, an enterpri&s;e again&s;t the Brit|i&s;h troops on Montre&s;ors I&s;land, was to take place that night; that he had ordered them to be kept in &s;afe cu&s;tody until the next morning, when, if their declarations re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h on the i&s;land, proved to be true, he would give them a pa&s;&s;|port to the back country, whither they wi&s;hed to go; but, in ca&s;e their information was fal&s;e, he would or|der them hanged immediately, as &s;pies; that he gave them the opportunity, if they had made a wrong &s;tatement to him, then to correct it. They both an|&s;wered, with perfect compo&s;ure, that they would cheerfully &s;ubmit to the condition. Major Thomas Henly was now one of our General's Aids-de-camp. He importuned that he might go with the detach|ment. He was refu&s;ed, and told that he had no bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="65" REF="63">
there; that he could exerci&s;e no command. He grew quite impatient, returned again to the Gen|eral's room, and addre&s;&s;ed him: "Pray, Sir, con&s;ent to my going with the party&mdash;let me have the plea&s;|ure of introducing the pri&s;oners to you to-morrow." All his friends pre&s;ent advi&s;ed him not to go. The General finally con&s;ented. The troops, at the hour a&s;&s;igned, embarked. Our General informed them, that he, with others, would be &s;pectators of the &s;cene, from a certain point near Haarlem Creek. Notice had been given to the guards and pickets on the <HI>York I&s;land</HI> &s;ide, not to hail the party as they went down. Unfortunately, the lower centinel had not been &s;o in&s;tructed. He was nearly oppo&s;ite to the point where our General was to be; and ju&s;t at the in&s;tant when he arrived, had challenged the boats, and ordered them to come to the &s;hore. From the boats they an&s;wered, "Lo! we are friends." The challenge was repeated. The an&s;wer was, "We tell you we are friends&mdash;hold your tongue." A bounce into the water was heard; and in&s;tantly Maj. Henly came wading to the &s;hore, &s;tepped up to our General, catched him by the hand, and &s;aid, "Sir, will it do?" Our General, holding him by the hand, replied, "I &s;ee nothing to the contrary;" to which Henly concluded by &s;aying, <HI>"Then it &s;hall do."</HI> He waded back to his boat, and got in. The centinel called again: "If you don't come to the &s;hore, I tell you I'll fire." A voice from &s;ome one in the boats, was, <HI>"Pull away!"</HI> The boats went on, and the centinel fired his piece. The boats reached the i&s;land almo&s;t at the moment intended, ju&s;t as the glimmer of the dawn was di&s;coverable. The three field-officers were in the fir&s;t boats. Their intention, on the moment of landing, was, for the two &s;econds in command to &s;pring, the one to the right, and the other to the left, and lead on the troops from the other
<PB N="66" REF="64">
two boats, which were to land on each &s;ide of the fir&s;t boat. The field-officers landed, and the men from their boat. The enemy's guard charged them, but were in&s;tantly driven back. The men in the other two boats, in&s;tead of landing, lay upon their oars. The Briti&s;h, &s;eeing this, returned warmly to the charge. The Americans, finding them&s;elves thus de&s;erted, returned to their boat; but not until Lieut. Col. Jack&s;on received a mu&s;ket-ball in his leg, and Maj. Henly, as he was getting into the boat, one through his heart, which put an in&s;tant end to his life. The boat joined the others, and they all re|turned, having, in the whole, about 14 killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing; Maj. Henly deeply regretted. Had only one of the other boats landed her men, the &s;ucce&s;s would have been very probable; but the two would have in&s;ured an execution of the whole plan, in the opinion of all concerned. The delin|quents in the other boats were arre&s;ted, and tried by court-martial, and one of the Captains ca&s;hiered.</P>
<P>On the night of the 23d, the Briti&s;h got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the works at Paulus Hook. The Americans had previou&s;ly taken off all the cannon and &s;tores. On the afternoon of the 24th, the remains of Maj. Hen|ly were interred by the &s;ide of Lieut. Col. Knoulton, on New-York I&s;land, with military honours.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;The militia, which had come out from the we&s;tern parts of the State of Connecticut, were di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;The General Officers were in council with a committee of Congre&s;s, &s;ent to make inquiry into the condition of the army, and agree upon the nec|e&s;&s;ary augmentation.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The Council &s;et again. The &s;ame day, Maj. Gen. Sullivan, who had for &s;ome time been a pri&s;oner with the Briti&s;h, came to Head-Quarters. The American pri&s;oners, which were taken in Can|ada,
<PB N="67" REF="65">
were &s;ent round by water, and landed at Bergen Point, New-Jer&s;ey, where they were &s;et at liberty. Gen. Thomp&s;on was among them.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Seven recruits for Maj. Rogers's corps, rai&s;ing for Briti&s;h &s;ervice, were taken, going to Long-I&s;land, and &s;ent in.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;There was an unu&s;ual movement of boats from Long-I&s;land to Montre&s;ors I&s;land, and an at|tack was &s;oon expected.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;The moving over of boats to Montre&s;ors I&s;land continued. The &s;ame day, a frigate went through Hell Gate, and came to anchor about 10 o'clock, A. M. near the La Brune. At 12. o'clock, &s;he came to &s;ail, and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward. Ju&s;t at even|ing another &s;hip came up; and the next morning,</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 1&s;t, was at anchor in the channel, between Haarlem and Baman's or Eldridge's I&s;land.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;The Brigadier-Generals of our General's divi&s;ion were in council, and &s;everal new works were laid out; among others, a redoubt on the hill above <HI>Williams's Bridge.</HI> Our General, in recon|noitring his po&s;ition, accompanied by Col. <HI>Hand,</HI> below the camp of the rifle corps, being apprehen|&s;ive that the Briti&s;h might land on Frog's Neck, took a view of the cau&s;eway between We&s;t-Che&s;ter and the point. Upon the neck, which runs between the&s;e two, is a tide-mill; and a plank bridge at the mill, at the we&s;t end of the cau&s;eway, (the &s;ide of the American army) was at this time a range of cord-wood, as advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated to cover a par|ty to defend the pa&s;s, as if con&s;tructed for the very purpo&s;e. After taking a full view, our General di|rected Col. Hand, immediately upon his return to his camp, to fix upon one of the be&s;t &s;ubaltern officers, and 25 picked men of his corps, and a&s;&s;ign them to this pa&s;s, as their alarm-po&s;t at all times; and, in ca&s;e the enemy made a landing on Frog's Neck, to direct
<PB N="68" REF="66">
this officer immediately to take up the planks of the bridge; to have every thing in readine&s;s to &s;et the mill on fire; but not to do it, unle&s;s the fire of the riflemen &s;hould appear in&s;ufficient to check the ad|vance of the enemy on to the cau&s;eway; to a&s;&s;ign another party to the head of the creek; to reinforce both, in ca&s;e the enemy landed; and that he &s;hould be &s;upported. Col. Hand made his arrangements accordingly.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;The brig and tenders in the Ea&s;t River came down, and ca&s;t anchor near the La Brune frigate; and the Roebuck and Phenix &s;ailed up the North River, and joined the other &s;hips which lay at anchor there.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;There were &s;ome movements among the Briti&s;h; and a party appeared to be very bu&s;y at work, a little below Haarlem. The &s;ame night, the Ameri|cans left the heights of Bergen. They were upwards of 2,000 &s;trong. They retreated as far back as Bur|ditt's Ferry.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Orders were given for throwing up a new work on Haarlem Creek, below the wood at Mor|ri&s;&s;ania.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Gen. <HI>Lincoln</HI> came to camp. He had come from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts with a body of militia. This was the fir&s;t of his joining the main army. The &s;ame day, the Briti&s;h were putting over hor&s;es from Horn's Hook to Long-I&s;land, and fixing their pontoons.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Early in the morning, three &s;hips, two of 40 guns, and one frigate, with two or three tenders, &s;tood up the North River. They were bri&s;kly can|nonaded from Fort Wa&s;hington and Fort Con&s;titu|tion. They however pa&s;&s;ed our works and the <HI>chevaux-de-fri&s;e;</HI> the American galleys, &s;mall craft, and two large &s;hips &s;tanding on before them. The two &s;hips were ran on &s;hore near Phillips's mills,
<PB N="69" REF="67">
and two of the galleys near Dobb's Ferry. The enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two galleys, and got them off. A boat landed a number of men, who plundered a &s;tore, &s;tove the ca&s;ks, and then &s;et the &s;tore on fire, and left it. The Americans &s;oon extin|gui&s;hed the fire.</P>
<P>Our General ordered Col. Sargent, with 500 in|fantry, 40 light-hor&s;e, Capt. Horton of the artillery, with two 12 pounders, and Capt. Crafts with a how|itzer, to march immediately, with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition, to Dobb's Ferry. The enemy took a &s;chooner loaded with rum, &s;ugar, wine, &amp;c. and &s;unk a &s;loop, which had on board the machine, invented by, and under the direction of, a Mr. <HI>Bu&s;hnell,</HI> intended to blow up the Briti&s;h &s;hips. This machine was worked under water. It conveyed a magazine of powder, which was to be fixed under the keel of a &s;hip, then freed from the machine, and left with clock-work going, which was to produce fire when the machine had got out of the way. Mr. Bu&s;hnell had great confidence of its &s;ucce&s;s, and had made &s;everal ex|periments which &s;eemed to give him countenance; but its fate was truly a contra&s;t to its de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Our General's divi&s;ion was formed in line, with its advance, re&s;erve flank-guards, and artillery, all in order of battle, when they were moved down over the different grounds, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed might be the &s;cene of action. Some of this ground was very broken, and there were many fences. The&s;e afforded frequent opportunities for the troops to break off and form; for the pioneers to open ave|nues, &amp;c. and for the whole to become acquainted with every part of the ground, and the be&s;t choice of it, if &s;uddenly called to action.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;One of the &s;hips which was ran a-ground, was got off by the Americans. Col. Sargent re|turned, having left 180 men to watch the motions of the Briti&s;h up the river.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="68">
11th.&mdash;There was a con&s;iderable movement among the Briti&s;h boats below. This afternoon, Gen. Wa&s;hington's plea&s;ure-boat, coming down the river with a fre&s;h breeze, and a top&s;ail hoi&s;ted, was &s;up|po&s;ed, by the artilleri&s;ts at Mount Wa&s;hington, to be one of the Briti&s;h tenders running down. A 12 pounder was di&s;charged at her, which was &s;o exactly pointed, as unfortunately to kill three Americans, who were much lamented. The &s;ame day, &s;everal of Gen. Lincoln's regiments arrived, two of which were po&s;ted on the North River.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Early in the morning, 80 or 90 Briti&s;h boats, full of men, &s;tood up the &s;ound, from Montre|&s;ors I&s;land, Long-I&s;land, &amp;c. The troops landed at Frog's Neck, and their advance pu&s;hed towards the cau&s;eway and bridge, at We&s;t-Che&s;ter mill. Col. Hand's riflemen took up the planks of the bridge, as had been directed, and commenced a fir|ing with their rifles. The Briti&s;h moved towards the head of the creek, but found here al&s;o the Amer|icans in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s. Our General imme|diately (as he had a&s;&s;ured Col. Hand he would do) ordered Col. Pre&s;cott, the hero of Bunker Hill, with his regiment, and Capt. Lieut. Bryant of the artil|lery, with a 3 pounder, to reinforce the riflemen at We&s;t-Che&s;ter cau&s;eway; and Col. Graham of the New-York line, with his regiment, and Lieut. Jack|&s;on of the artillery, with a 6 pounder, to reinforce at the head of the creek; all of which was promptly done, to the check and di&s;appointment of the en|emy. The Briti&s;h encamped on the neck. The riflemen and Yagers kept up a &s;cattering popping at each other acro&s;s the mar&s;h; and the Americans on their &s;ide, and the Briti&s;h on the other, threw up a work at the end of the cau&s;eway. Capt. Bryant, now and then, when there was an object, &s;aluted the Briti&s;h with a field-piece.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="69">
In the afternoon, 40 or 50 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ed up, and came to anchor off Frog's Point. The &s;ame evening, Gen. M'Dougal's brigade joined our Gen|eral's divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;The brigade, formerly under the command of our General, when he was Brigadier, joined his di|vi&s;ion. The divi&s;ion now became very &s;trong. The General Officers of the army were this day in coun|cil, at our General's Quarters.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Our General, with the Generals under his command, reconnoitred the enemy at Frog's Neck; afterwards, the General Officers of the army recon|noitred the various grounds. The &s;ame day, Maj. Gen. Lee was ordered to the command of the troops above King&s;bridge, now become the large&s;t part of the American army. But Gen. Wa&s;hington had de|&s;ired him not to exerci&s;e the command for a day or two, until he could make him&s;elf acquainted with the po&s;t, its circum&s;tances, and arrangements of duty. A great number of &s;loops, boats, &amp;c. were pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ound ea&s;tward, ju&s;t at du&s;k&mdash;probably convey|ing ammunition, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. to the troops at Frog's Point.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Five &s;ailors came off from the La Brune. They informed, that there was a large body of the Briti&s;h on Frog's Point, and that an attack might be &s;oon expected. The &s;cattering fire acro&s;s the mar&s;h continued, and now and then a man was killed.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Two works were di&s;covered on Frog's Neck, nearly fini&s;hed. The General Officers of the army rode to reconnoitre the ground at <HI>Pell's Neck,</HI> &amp;c. and it was determined that the po&s;ition of the Amer|ican army &s;hould be immediately changed; the left flank to be extended more northerly, to prevent its being turned by the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Wad&s;worth's and Fellows's brigades, came to King&s;bridge. The Briti&s;h &s;hipping, &amp;c. contin|ued moving ea&s;tward.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="70">
18th.&mdash;The regiment at We&s;t-Che&s;ter cau&s;eway had been relieved by another. The officer on com|mand there, this morning, &s;ent up an expre&s;s to our General, informing him that the Briti&s;h were open|ing an embra&s;ure in their work at the end of the cau&s;eway, and that he apprehended they intended, under a cannonade from this, to attempt to pa&s;s. Our General ordered one of his Aids to gallop his hor&s;e to the officer commanding the brigade, near Volentine's, the neare&s;t to We&s;t-Che&s;ter, and order him to form his brigade in&s;tantly. Arriving, him&s;elf, by the time the brigade was formed, he ordered the officer to march, with the utmo&s;t expedition, to the head of the cau&s;eway, to reinforce the troops there; him&s;elf moving on with them. When the troops had advanced to about half the way between the head of the creek, and the po&s;t at the head of the cau&s;eway, another expre&s;s met him, informing him that the whole Briti&s;h army were in motion, and &s;eemed to be moving towards the pa&s;s at the head of the creek. Upon this, the brigade was or|dered to halt, the whole to prime and load, and the rear regiment to file off by the left, and march bri&s;k|ly to reinforce the Americans at the pa&s;s, at the head of the creek. At this in&s;tant, Gen. Wa&s;hington came up, and having inquired of our General, the &s;tate of things, ordered him to return immediately, and have his divi&s;ion formed ready for action, and to take &s;uch a po&s;ition as might appear be&s;t calcu|lated to oppo&s;e the enemy, &s;hould they attempt to land another body of troops on Morri&s;&s;ania, which he thought not improbable. Our General immedi|ately obeyed the order.</P>
<P>The wind was now fre&s;h at &s;outh-we&s;t. The Brit|i&s;h cro&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide of Frog's Neck, embark|ed on board their boats, cro&s;&s;ed over the cove, land|ed on Pell's Neck, and moved bri&s;kly upwards.
<PB N="73" REF="71">
Three or four of the American regiments advanced towards them, and took a good po&s;ition behind a &s;tone fence. When the Briti&s;h had advanced &s;uffi|ciently near, they gave them a pretty clo&s;e fire, which checked them, and even obliged them to fall back; but being immediately &s;upported, they return|ed vigorou&s;ly to the charge. The action was &s;harp, for a &s;hort time; but the Americans were &s;oon obliged to give way to &s;uperior force. <HI>Shepard's, Read's, Baldwin's,</HI> and <HI>Glover's</HI> regiments, had the principal &s;hare in this action. The Americans had between 30 and 40 men killed and wounded; among the latter, Col. Shepard, in the throat, not mortally, although the ball came well nigh effecting in&s;tant death. The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h was not known, but mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable. They advanced al|mo&s;t to New Rochelle, and halted. The American army extended its left.</P>
<P>A number of boats went down towards New-York. It now became nece&s;&s;ary, immediately to quit the po&s;ition in the neighbourhood of King&s;bridge, the Briti&s;h being in the rear of the left of our army; and it is not a little unaccountable, that they did not attempt to &s;tretch them&s;elves acro&s;s to the Hud&s;on, which might have been done with great ea&s;e. They only moved higher up, on the other &s;ide of the little rivulet <HI>Brunx,</HI> which was generally fordable. The White Plains were fixed upon for the next po&s;ition of the American army. A &s;trong garri&s;on was to be left at Fort Wa&s;hington, and our General was to leave one of his regiments, to garri&s;on Fort Inde|pendence.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;At about 4 o'clock, P. M. our General's divi&s;ion moved from above King&s;bridge, having, be|&s;ides their light field-pieces, two heavy iron twelve|pounders. About 8 o'clock in the evening, they pa&s;&s;ed Gen. Lincoln's quarters, on Volentine's Hill,
<PB N="74" REF="72">
where the Commander in Chief was to &s;pend the night. Our General waited upon him, to know if he had any particular commands for him. The Com|mander in Chief only advi&s;ed to &s;end forward one of his regiments, to occupy the road coming from <HI>Ward's Bridge,</HI> nearly to who&s;e farm the Briti&s;h had now advanced; left, appri&s;ed of his moving, they &s;hould annoy his right flank, which, if it had been day-light, would have been open to their view: But before the column reached this cro&s;s road, it was learnt, that Col. Jonathan Brewer's regiment of ar|tificers, who were pretty &s;trong, and well armed, were to pa&s;s the night at the entrance of the road, leading to the bridge before mentioned. The divi&s;|ion reached Chaderton's Hill, to the &s;outh of White Plains, at 4 o'clock in the morning of the 22d, hav|ing marched all night. The in&s;tant our General a&s;|cended the hill, he noticed, to appearance, many fla&s;hes, re&s;embling the fla&s;h of the pan of a mu&s;ket, on the other &s;ide of the lot; on which he immediately ordered a Captain, with a party, to di&s;cover what it was; who returned, that he could not make di&s;cov|ery of any thing. The&s;e were indeed the fla&s;hes of di&s;charged mu&s;kets at &s;ome di&s;tance; the height of ground having decoyed the appearance of the di&s;|tance. Lord Sterling, who was before in this vicin|ity with his brigade, had formed an enterpri&s;e again&s;t Maj. Rogers's corps. The old Indian hunter in the la&s;t French war, who had now engaged in the Brit|i&s;h &s;ervice, with his corps, now lay on the out-po&s;t of the Briti&s;h army, near Marroneck. The enter|pri&s;e was conducted with good addre&s;s; and if the Americans had known exactly how Rogers's corps lay, they would probably have killed or taken the whole. As it was, 36 pri&s;oners, 60 mu&s;kets, and &s;ome other articles, were taken. The Major, con|formably to his former general conduct, e&s;caped
<PB N="75" REF="73">
with the re&s;t of his corps. This was a pretty affair; and if the writer could recollect the name of the commanding-officer, with pride and plea&s;ure he would in&s;ert it. He belonged to one of the &s;outhern lines of the army; and the whole of the party were &s;outh|ern troops.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, our General moved his divi&s;ion, and took po&s;t on the high &s;trong ground, to the north of the court-hou&s;e. Gen. Sullivan's divi&s;|ion reached the Plains in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceed|ing night. In the po&s;ition of White Plains, our Gen|eral's divi&s;ion was on the left of the line. On his left was a deep hollow, through which ran a &s;mall brook, which came from a mill-pond, a little above. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of this hollow was a very commanding ground, which would enfilade the divi&s;ion. The top of this high ground was covered with wood. To this hill he ordered Col. Malcolm, with his regiment of New-York troops, and Lieut. Fenno of the artillery, with a field-piece, directing them to take po&s;t in the &s;kirt of the wood, at the &s;outh brow of the hill. The ground, from our General's left to the right, de&s;cended gradually a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and then gradually a&s;cended up to the plain, and &s;till on to the right, to more commanding ground. On this was the American army formed, the line running nearly from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t. There were &s;ome &s;trong works thrown up on the plain, acro&s;s the road, and &s;till to the right of it. Chaderton's Hill was a little advanced of the line, and &s;eparated from it by the little rivulet Brunx. A body of the Americans were po&s;ted on this hill. Head-Quarters were on the plain, near the cro&s;s roads. Our General's divi&s;ion had only &s;light works for mu&s;ketry.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;A cannonade was heard towards the Hud|&s;on. The &s;ame evening, Col. Tyler's, Hunting|ton's
<PB N="76" REF="74">
and Throop's regiments, of General Par&s;ons's brigade, and of our General's divi&s;ion, moved, and took po&s;t at the head of King-&s;treet, near Rye Pond. Gen. Lee's divi&s;ion had not yet got up to the army.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;At 5 o'clock, A. M. a firing of &s;mall|arms was heard to the &s;outhward. It was a &s;kirmi&s;h between 200 men of Gen. Lee's divi&s;ion, and 250 He&s;&s;ians&mdash;10 of the latter were killed, and two taken pri&s;oners. The Briti&s;h continued moving up, but with great caution, their rear &s;carcely advancing, when they came to encamp again, much further than where the advance had moved from&mdash;they ad|vanced in two columns.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Eight American regiments were ordered to be ready to march in the approaching night. Gen. Putnam was to command them; and they were intended to make an attack on the enemy's advance, if it &s;hould appear to be practicable. The &s;ame morning, one 12 pounder at Dobb's Ferry drove the Briti&s;h man-of-war off that place from her &s;tation.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Gen. Lee's divi&s;ion jointed the army. In a&s;cending &s;ome of the hills on the road, this divi&s;ion, encumbered with many waggons, was obliged to halt, and double the teams, in open view of the Briti&s;h, and at no con&s;iderable di&s;tance, who did not attempt to di&s;turb them; which, had they done, the lo&s;s of the cannon, waggons, &amp;c. could not have been avoided. The troops would have bent their march unencumbered towards the Hud&s;on; but the waggons, &amp;c. mu&s;t have been left. Two or three Briti&s;h &s;oldiers and a He&s;&s;ian were taken pri&s;|oners, and &s;ent in.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;In the forenoon, a heavy cannonade was heard towards Fort Wa&s;hington. Thirteen He&s;&s;ians and two or three Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were &s;ent in on this day. From the American camp to the we&s;t-&s;outh-
<PB N="77" REF="75">
we&s;t, there appeared to be a very commanding height, worthy of attention. The Commander in Chief or|dered the General Officers who were off duty, to at|tend him to reconnoitre this ground, on this morn|ing. When arrived at the ground, although very commanding, it did not appear &s;o much &s;o, as other grounds to the north, and almo&s;t parallel with the left of the army, as it was then formed. "Yonder," &s;ays Major-Gen. Lee, pointing to the grounds ju&s;t mentioned, "is the ground we ought to occupy." "Let us then go and view it," replied the Com|mander in Chief. When on the way, a light-hor&s;eman came up in full gallop, his hor&s;e almo&s;t out of breath, and addre&s;&s;ed Gen. Wa&s;hington&mdash;"The Briti&s;h are on the camp, Sir." The General ob&s;erved&mdash;"Gen|tlemen, we have now other bu&s;ine&s;s than reconnoi|tring," putting his hor&s;e in full gallop for the camp, and followed by the other officers. When arrived at Head-Quarters, the Adjutant-General [Read,] who had remained at camp, informed the Commander in Chief, that the guards had been all beat in, and the whole American army were now at their re&s;pective po&s;ts, in order of battle. The Com|mander in Chief turned round to the officers, and only &s;aid, "Gentlemen, you will repair to your re|&s;pective po&s;ts, and do the be&s;t you can." Our Gen|eral, on arriving at his own divi&s;ion, found them all in the lines; and, from the height of his po&s;t, found that the fir&s;t attack was directed again&s;t the Ameri|cans on Chaderton's Hill. The little river Brunx, which ran between the American right and this hill, after running round its north &s;ide, turned and ran down on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t, The Briti&s;h ad|vanced in two columns. At this in&s;tant, the can|nonade was bri&s;k on both &s;ides; directed by the Briti&s;h acro&s;s the hollow and Brunx, again&s;t the Americans on the hill, and by them returned. Al|mo&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="76">
at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the right column, compo&s;ed of Briti&s;h troops, preceded by about 20 light-hor&s;e in full gallop, and brandi&s;hing their &s;words, appeared on the road leading to the court-hou&s;e, and now di|rectly in the front of our General's divi&s;ion. The light-hor&s;e leaped the fence of a wheat-field, at the foot of the hill, on which Col. Malcolm's regiment was po&s;ted; of which the light-hor&s;e were not aware, until a &s;hot from Lieut. Fenno's field-piece gave them notice, by &s;triking in the mid&s;t of them, and a hor&s;e|man pitching from his hor&s;e. They then wheeled &s;hort about, galloped out of the field as fa&s;t as they came in, rode behind a little hill in the road, and faced about; the tops of their caps only being vi&s;i|ble to our General, where he &s;tood. The column came no further up the road, but wheeled to the left by platoons, as they came up; and, pa&s;&s;ing through a bar, or gateway, directed their head towards the troops on Chaderton's Hill, now engaged. When the head of the column had got nearly acro&s;s the lot, their front got out of &s;ight; nor could the extent of their rear be now di&s;covered. The &s;un &s;hone bright, their arms glittered, and perhaps troops never were &s;hewn to more advantage, than the&s;e now appeared. The whole now halted; and for a few minutes, the men all &s;at down in the &s;ame order in which they &s;tood, no one appearing to move out of his place. The cannonade continued bri&s;k acro&s;s the Brunx. A part of the left column, compo&s;ed of Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ians, forded the river, and marched along under the cover of the hill, until they had gained &s;ufficient ground to the left of the Americans; when, by fa|cing to the left, their column became a line, parallel with the Americans. When they bri&s;kly a&s;cended the hill, the fir&s;t column re&s;umed a quick march. As the troops, which were advancing to the attack, a&s;cended the hill, the cannonade on the &s;ide of the

Briti&s;h cea&s;ed; as their own men became expo&s;ed to their fire, if continued. The fire of &s;mall-arms was now very heavy, and without any di&s;tinction of &s;ounds. This led &s;ome American officers, who were looking on, to ob&s;erve that the Briti&s;h were wor&s;ted, as their cannon had cea&s;ed firing; but a few minutes evinced that the Americans were giving way. They moved off the hill in a great body, neither running, nor ob&s;erving the be&s;t order. The Briti&s;h a&s;cended the hill very &s;lowly; and when arrived at its &s;um|mit, formed and dre&s;&s;ed their line, without the lea&s;t attempt to pur&s;ue the Americans. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Americans was incon&s;iderable; that of the Briti&s;h was not then known. The Briti&s;h hav|ing got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this hill, it gave them a va&s;t ad|vantage of the American lines, almo&s;t down to the centre.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h began to throw up &s;ome &s;mall works on the hill, of which they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Americans were drawing back; and a po&s;ition was to be taken on the high &s;trong grounds, before in the rear of a part of the army. The left of our General's divi&s;ion was not to move; but the re|mainder of his divi&s;ion, and all the other divi&s;ions of the army, were to fall back and form, nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t. About this time, Col. La&s;her, who be|longed to our General's divi&s;ion, (and who had been le&s;t with his regiment to garri&s;on Fort Independence, near King&s;bridge) &s;ent an expre&s;s, who pa&s;&s;ed the enemy in the night, to know what he &s;hould do, the regiment growing weak and &s;ickly. Our General applied to the Commander in Chief, to know his plea&s;ure, who directed, that the Colonel &s;hould give notice to Col. Magaw, who commanded at Fort Wa&s;hington, that he might take away the cannon, &s;tores, &amp;c. and that Col. La&s;her, after de&s;troying the barracks, huts, &amp;c. &s;hould join the army, which he
<PB N="80" REF="80">
&s;oon effected. This day, 3 pri&s;oners were &s;ent in; and the Americans were now throwing up &s;ome &s;trong works on the high grounds.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h remained upon the ground they had taken.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;The Briti&s;h continued as before, throwing up a work, &amp;c. At night, the Americans evacuated their works on the plain, near late Head-Quarters, &s;etting fire to &s;everal barns, and one hou&s;e, which contained forage, and &s;ome &s;tores that could not be removed.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;In the morning, the Briti&s;h ad|vanced with a number of field-pieces, to the north of the road, near late Head-Quarters, (a heavy col|umn appearing behind on the hill, ready to move forward) and commenced a furious cannonade on our General's divi&s;ion, which was nobly returned by Capt. Lieut. Bryant and Lieut. Jack&s;on, of the artil|lery. Our General's fir&s;t anxiety, was for Col. Malcolm's regiment on the hill, to the ea&s;t of the hollow on the left, le&s;t the enemy &s;hould pu&s;h a col|umn into the hollow, and cut the regiment off from the divi&s;ion. He therefore ordered Maj. Keith, one of his Aids, to gallop over, and order Col. Malcolm to come off immediately, with Lieut. Fenno's artil|lery: But, upon a more critical view of the ground in the hollow, (at the head of which there was a heavy &s;tone wall, well &s;ituated to cover a body of troops to throw a heavy fire directly down it, while an oblique fire could be thrown in on both &s;ides) he ordered Maj. Pollard, his other aid, to gallop after Keith, and countermand the fir&s;t order, and direct the Colonel to remain at his po&s;t, and he &s;hould be &s;upported. A &s;trong regiment was ordered to the head of the hollow, to occupy the wall. The can|nonade was bri&s;k on both &s;ides, through which the two Aids-de-camp pa&s;&s;ed, in going and returning.
<PB N="81" REF="81">
At this in&s;tant, Gen. Wa&s;hington rode up to the hill. His fir&s;t que&s;tion to our General, was, "H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> is your divi&s;ion?" He was an&s;wered, "They are all in order." "Have you," &s;aid the Commander in Chief, "any troops on the hill over the hollow?" He was an&s;wered, "Malcolm's regiment is there." "If you do not call them off immediately," &s;ays the General, "you may lo&s;e them, if the enemy pu&s;h a column up the hollow." He was an&s;wered, that even in that ca&s;e, their retreat &s;hould be made &s;afe; that a &s;trong regiment was po&s;ted at the head of the hol|low, behind the wall; that this regiment, with the oblique fire of the divi&s;ion, would &s;o check the ene|my, as to allow Malcolm to make a &s;afe retreat. The Commander in Chief concluded by &s;aying, "Take care that you do not lo&s;e them." The artil|lery of the divi&s;ion was &s;o well directed, as to throw the Briti&s;h artillery-men &s;everal times into confu&s;ion; and finding that they could not here make any im|pre&s;&s;ion, drew back their pieces, the column not ad|vancing. The Briti&s;h artillery now made a circuitous movement, and came down toward the American right. Here, unknown to them, were &s;ome 12 pound|ers; upon the di&s;charge of which, they made off with their field-pieces as fa&s;t as their hor&s;es could draw them. A &s;hot from the American cannon, at this place, took off the head of a He&s;&s;ian artillery-man. They al&s;o left one of the artillery hor&s;es dead on the field. What other lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tained was not known. Of our General's divi&s;ion, one man only, belonging to Col. Paulding's regiment of New-York troops, was killed. The Briti&s;h made no other attempt on the Americans, while they remained at White Plains. The two armies lay looking at each other, and with|in long cannon-&s;hot. In the night time, the Briti&s;h lighted up a va&s;t number of fires, the weather grow|ing pretty cold. The&s;e fires, &s;ome on the level
<PB N="82" REF="82">
ground, &s;ome at the foot of the hills, and at all di&s;|tances to their brows, &s;ome of which were lofty, &s;eemed to the eye to mix with the &s;tars, and to be of different magnitudes. The American &s;ide, doubt|le&s;s, exhibited to them a &s;imilar appearance. On this day, our General ordered three redoubts, with a line in front, to be thrown up on the &s;ummit of his po&s;t, &s;o con&s;tructed, that the whole of them could make a defence, and &s;upport each other at the &s;ame time, if attacked. The&s;e, to the enemy, in who&s;e view they fully were, mu&s;t have appeared very for|midable, although they were de&s;igned principally for defence again&s;t &s;mall-arms; and perhaps works were never rai&s;ed quicker. There were the &s;talks of a large corn-field at the &s;pot: the pulling the&s;e up in hills, took up a large lump of earth with each. The roots of the &s;talks and earth on them, placed in the face of the works, an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of &s;ods, or facines. The tops being placed inwards, as the loo&s;e earth was thrown upon them, became as &s;o many ties to the work, which was carried up with a di&s;|patch &s;carcely conceivable.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h, as they &s;ay, had meditated an attack on the Americans, which was only prevented by the wetne&s;s of the night. Be this as it may, our Gene|ral had ordered his divi&s;ion, at evening roll-call, to be at their alarm-po&s;ts, (which they every morning man|ned, whil&s;t at this place) half an hour &s;ooner than u&s;ual. He had then no other rea&s;on for doing this, than the near po&s;ition of the enemy, and the proba|bility that they would &s;oon make an attack: But the Commander in Chief mu&s;t have made &s;ome other di&s;|covery; for, after our General was in bed, Col. Carey, who was one of the Aids-de-camp of Gen. Wa&s;hington, came to the door of his marque, and calling to him, informed him that the whole ar|my were to be at their alarm-po&s;ts, the next morn|ing,
<PB N="83" REF="83">
half an hour &s;ooner than u&s;ual, and that he was to govern him&s;elf accordingly. Our General repli|ed, that he had fortunately given &s;uch orders to his divi&s;ion, at evening roll-call. He therefore neither got up him&s;elf, nor di&s;turbed any other of his divi&s;ion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stedman</HI> mi&s;takes greatly in his hi&s;tory, where, in vol. I. page 216, he a&s;&s;erts, that the Americans "evacuated their lines on the morning of the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and retired acro&s;s the Croten Riv|er to North-Ca&s;tle, &s;etting fire, in their retreat, to all the hou&s;es on White Plains." The Americans did not quit their &s;trong po&s;ition at the <HI>back</HI> of White Plains, until the Briti&s;h had re|treated towards King&s;bridge, as far as Dobb's Ferry, and had there encamped, as is fully &s;hewn in the&s;e Memoirs.</NOTE></P>
<P>3d.&mdash;The centinels reported, that, during the pre|ceding night, they heard the rumbling of carriages to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward; and it was apprehended that the Briti&s;h were changing their po&s;ition.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h centinels were withdrawn from their advanced po&s;ts. It was apprehended that they meant a movement. The American army was im|mediately ordered under arms. At 2 o'clock, P. M. the enemy appeared, formed on Chaderton's Hill, and on &s;everal hills to the we&s;tward of it. Several reconnoitring parties, who were &s;ent out, reported that the enemy were withdrawing. About 12 o'clock, this night, a party of the Americans wan|tonly &s;et fire to the court-hou&s;e, Dr. Graham's hou&s;e, and &s;everal other private hou&s;es, which &s;tood between the two armies. This gave great di&s;gu&s;t to the whole American army, and drew from the Commander in Chief the following paragraph, in his orders of the 6th: "It is with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and abhor|rence, the General is informed, that &s;ome ba&s;e and cowardly wretches have, la&s;t night, &s;et fire to the court-hou&s;e, and other buildings which the enemy left. The army may rely upon it, that they &s;hall be brought to ju&s;tice, and meet with the puni&s;hment they de&s;erve."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="84">
The Briti&s;h were moving down towards Dobb's Ferry. A detachment from the American army was &s;ent out in the morning to hara&s;s their rear, but could not come up with them.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Several de&s;erters came in from the enemy: they reported that they were removing towards New-York. The reconnoitring parties di&s;covered them encamped near Dobb's Ferry. They were foraging grain and hay, and driving in the cattle. Two &s;tore-&s;hips had run up pa&s;t Fort Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The enemy continued encamped at and be|low Dobb's Ferry. A new di&s;po&s;ition of the Amer|ican army was now to take place. The &s;outhern troops were to cro&s;s over into the Jer&s;ies. Gen. Lee, with his own, Spencer's, and Sullivan's divi&s;|ions, were to remain, to &s;ecure and bring off the &s;tores; and were then to follow into the Jer&s;ies. Our General was ordered to march with his divi&s;ion to Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;The divi&s;ion moved from near White Plains, and the &s;ame night halted at North-Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;In the afternoon, the divi&s;ion reached Peck's Kill. Gen. Wa&s;hington arrived at the &s;ame place about &s;un&s;et. It was this day learnt, that Gen. Carleton's army in Canada, after pu&s;hing the Amer|icans, in that quarter, from po&s;t to po&s;t, until they arrived at Ticonderoga, ju&s;t made their appearance before that place, and then retired towards Quebec.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief directed our General to attend him in taking a view of Fort Montgomery, and the other works up the river. Lord Sterling, Generals James and George Clinton, Gen. Mifflin and others were of the company. They went as far up the river as Con&s;titution I&s;land, which is oppo&s;ite to We&s;t-Point, the latter of which was not then taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; but the glance of the eye at it, without going on &s;hore, evinced that this
<PB N="85" REF="85">
po&s;t was not to be neglected. There was a &s;mall work and a block-hou&s;e on Con&s;titution I&s;land. Fort Montgomery was in con&s;iderable forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief directed our General to ride early in the morning with him, to reconnoitre the grounds at the Gorge of the High|lands; and, on his return, gave him the command of the troops and po&s;ts in the Highlands, on both &s;ides of the river, with written in&s;tructions to &s;ecure and fortify them with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, making a di&s;tribution of his troops to the different po&s;ts; and, at about 10 o'clock, A. M. Gen. Wa&s;hington cro&s;&s;ed over the river into the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Our General made a di&s;po&s;ition of the troops under his command, to their &s;everal de&s;tina|tions. Col. Huntington's and Tyler's regiments, to the we&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, to Sidnum's Bridge on Ramapaugh River, to cover the pa&s;&s;es into the High|lands, on that &s;ide: Pre&s;cott's, Ward's and Wyllis's regiments, of Par&s;ons's brigade, (as were the other two regiments) to the &s;outh entrance of the High|lands, beyond Robin&s;on's Bridge: Gen. George Clinton's brigade, to the heights above Peek's Kill Landing: Gen. Scott's brigade, with the three regi|ments of Gen. Par&s;ons's brigade: Gen. James Clin|ton, with the troops under his command, were at the forts up the river. The Briti&s;h moved down, near to King&s;bridge.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the Briti&s;h made their attack on Fort Wa&s;hington. Gen. Knyphau&s;en, with a heavy column of He&s;&s;ians, advanced by King&s;bridge. They were di&s;covered by the Americans, from the high grounds north of Fort Wa&s;hington, as the day broke; and cannonaded from the field-pieces, placed at this advanced po&s;t. The He&s;&s;ian column divided into two; the right a&s;cending the &s;trong broken ground towards Spitten-Devil Creek; the left nearer
<PB N="86" REF="86">
to the road, towards the Gorge. The fir&s;t obtained the ground without much difficulty; but the Ameri|cans made a mo&s;t noble oppo&s;ition again&s;t the latter, and, for a con&s;iderable time, kept them from a&s;cend|ing the hill, making a terrible &s;laughter among them; but the great &s;uperiority of the a&s;&s;ailants, with an unabating firmne&s;s, finally prevailed: their lo&s;s was greater here than at any other place. Meanwhile, the Briti&s;h cro&s;&s;ed Haarlem Creek, in two different places, charged, and finally routed the Americans on that &s;ide, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the &s;trong po&s;t of Laurel Hill, on the other &s;ide of the road, from Fort Wa&s;hington, and not very di&s;tant from it; Lord Percy at the &s;ame time advancing, with the troops under his command on the i&s;land, to|wards the fort on that &s;ide. The Americans, now gen|erally driven from their out-works, retired to the fort, which was crowded full. A &s;ingle &s;hell, now dropping among them, mu&s;t have made dreadful havock.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington was now a &s;pectator of this di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene, from the high bank at Fort Lee, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Hud&s;on; and having a wi&s;h to communicate &s;omething to Col. Magaw, the com|manding officer at Fort Wa&s;hington, Capt. Gooch of Bo&s;ton, a brave and daring man, offered to be the bearer of it. He ran down to the river, jumped in|to a &s;mall boat, pu&s;hed over the river, landed under the bank, ran up to the fort, and delivered the me&s;|&s;age&mdash;came out, ran and jumped over the broken ground, dodging the He&s;&s;ians, &s;ome of whom &s;truck at him with their pieces, and others attempted to thru&s;t him with their bayonets&mdash;e&s;caping through them, he got to his boat, and returned to Fort Lee. The Briti&s;h had &s;ummoned Col. Magaw to &s;urrender, and were preparing their batteries to play on the fort, when Col. Magaw thought it be&s;t to &s;urrender the po&s;t, which he did accordingly, between two and
<PB N="87" REF="87">
three thou&s;and men becoming pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s in killed and wounded, on the American &s;ide was incon&s;iderable; but the lo&s;s in pri&s;oners was a &s;eri|ous blow indeed. The pri&s;oners were marched to New-York; where, being crowded in pri&s;ons and &s;ugar-hou&s;es, (many of them being militia from the Jer&s;ey flying-camp, who had been &s;ent over to rein|force the garri&s;on, and were unu&s;ed to a &s;oldier's life, much le&s;s to the poi&s;onous &s;tagnant air of a crowd|ed pri&s;on,) they fell &s;ick, and daily died, in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner. It was common, on a morning, for the car-men to come and take away the bodies for burial, <HI>by loads!&mdash;</HI>O ye officers of the provo&s;t! to whatever nation or people you belong, when the unfortunate of your fellow-men are thus committed to your charge, clothe your&s;elves with humanity, and &s;oothe di&s;tre&s;s as far as in your power; for by this, you will &s;ecure a better reward than your pre&s;|ent wages. And you who have the honour to com|mand armies, when your victories have filled provo&s;ts and pri&s;ons, think it not beneath you to vi&s;it the pri&s;ons, that with your own eyes you may &s;ee the &s;tate of your pri&s;oners: for &s;uch <HI>vi&s;its,</HI> the great CAPTAIN OF YOUR SALVATION hath &s;aid, &s;hall be con&s;idered as made to Him&s;elf; while it al&s;o gives you a name among men clo&s;ely allied to that of the conqueror. The truly brave are always humane.</P>
<P>Elated with the ea&s;y reduction of Fort Wa&s;hing|ton, the Briti&s;h determined to cro&s;s into the Jer&s;ies, and attack Gen. Wa&s;hington on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the 18th, Lord Cornwallis, with a &s;trong body of the Briti&s;h forces, landed at Clo&s;ter Landing, on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, above Fort Lee, the garri&s;on of which were obliged to leave that po&s;t; and &s;ome cannon, &s;tores and provi&s;ions, which could not be removed, fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="88">
20th.&mdash;Ju&s;t at evening, an expre&s;s, which our General had &s;ent down to Gen. Wa&s;hington before he had any knowledge of what had happened, re|turned with a mo&s;t alarming account of what he had &s;een with his own eyes, viz. that the Americans were rapidly retreating, and the Briti&s;h as rapidly pur&s;uing. The Adjutant-General [Read] wi&s;hed to write to Gen. Lee; but he had neither pen, ink, or paper with him. The light-hor&s;eman had a rough piece of wrapping-paper in his pocket, and the Adjutant-General had an old pencil. Bringing the&s;e two to|gether, he wrote to Gen. Lee&mdash;"Dear General, we are flying before the Briti&s;h. I pray"&mdash;and the pencil broke. He then told the light-hor&s;eman to carry the paper to Gen. Lee, and tell him that he was verbally ordered to add, after <HI>I pray,</HI> "you to pu&s;h and join us." The light-hor&s;eman, when he ar|rived at our General's, was both fatigued and wet. He reque&s;ted that one of his brother hor&s;emen might proceed to Gen. Lee; but he was told that no other could di&s;charge the duty enjoined on him by the Adjutant-General, and that Gen. Lee might wi&s;h to make many inquiries of him. He was therefore re|fre&s;hed and pu&s;hed on. Gen. Lee, in&s;tead of moving his divi&s;ion, or any part of it, wrote our General, by the returning expre&s;s, the following letter.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received a recommendation, not a po&s;itive order, from the General, to move the corps under my command to the other &s;ide of the river. This recommendation was, I imagine, on the pre|&s;umption that I had already moved nearer to Peek's Kill. There is no po&s;&s;ibility of cro&s;&s;ing over Dobb's Ferry, or at any place lower than King's Ferry, which to us would be &s;uch an immen&s;e round, that we

I mu&s;t therefore de&s;ire and reque&s;t, that you will order 2,000 of your corps, under a Brigadier-General, to cro&s;s the river oppo&s;ite the General, and wait his further orders.

<SALUTE>DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favours, of this date, the former of which I had an|&s;wered early in the evening. With re&s;pect to the latter, upon having recour&s;e to my in&s;tructions, I find they are &s;uch as not to admit of moving any part of the troops from the po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned to me, un|le&s;s it be by expre&s;s orders from his Excellency, or to &s;upport you, in ca&s;e you are attacked. My in|&s;tructions, among other things, are as follow:
<Q><P>Your divi&s;ion, with &s;uch troops as are now at Forts Montgomery, Independence and Con&s;titu|tion, are to be under your command, and remain in this quarter, for the &s;ecurity of the above po&s;ts, and the pa&s;&s;es through the Highlands, from this place, and the one on the we&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's
<PB N="90" REF="90">
River. Unnece&s;&s;ary it is for me to &s;ay any thing to evince the importance of &s;ecuring the land and water communication through the&s;e pa&s;&s;es, or to prove the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing every ex|ertion in your power, to have &s;uch works erected for the defence of them, as your own judgment, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that of your Brigadiers and Engineer, may &s;hew the expediency of. You will not only keep in view the importance of &s;ecuring the&s;e pa&s;&s;es, but the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it without delay: not only from the probability of the enemy's at|tempting to &s;eize them, but from the advanced &s;ea&s;on, which will not admit of any &s;pade-work, af|ter the fro&s;t (which may daily be expected) &s;ets in.</P>
<P>Lo&s;e not a moment, therefore, in choo&s;ing the grounds on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ide of the river, on which your intended works are to be erected. Let your men de&s;igned for each po&s;t be &s;peedily allotted,</P></Q> &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>After in&s;tructions &s;o po&s;itive and pre&s;&s;ing, you will readily agree that it would be very improper, in me, to order any of the troops from po&s;ts, to which they are &s;o expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igned, and from bu&s;ine&s;s which in his Excellency's view is &s;o very important. Add to this, their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition is &s;uch, that to collect any thing near the number you mention, would oc|ca&s;ion as great delay, and cau&s;e many of them to march nearly as far, as if &s;ent immediately from your quarter.</P>

<P>BY your mode of rea&s;oning, the General's in|&s;tructions are &s;o binding, that not a tittle mu&s;t be broke through, for the &s;alvation of the General and the army. I have ordered Glover's brigade to march up towards Peek's Kill, to put the pa&s;&s;age of the Highlands out of danger; but I intend to take 2,000 from your divi&s;ion with me into the Jer&s;ies; &s;o I mu&s;t de&s;ire that you will have that number in readine&s;s by the day after to-morrow, when I &s;hall be with you early in the forenoon;</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE my mode of rea&s;oning as it may, I conceive it to be my duty to obey my in&s;tructions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are po&s;itive and poignant, and that to deviate from them even in extreme ca&s;es, would be an error; though perhaps an error on the right &s;ide.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that I have the &s;alvation of the General and army &s;o much at heart, that the lea&s;t recommendation from him, to march my di|vi&s;ion, or any part of them, over the river, &s;hould have been in&s;tantly obeyed, without waiting for a po&s;itive order.</P>
<P>My conduct mu&s;t be approved or cen&s;ured, as I adhere to, or depart from, my orders; and, as it is my duty, I &s;hall &s;trictly abide by them, until they are countermanded in &s;uch manner, as will ju&s;tify

<P>After the foregoing was &s;ent off, our General re|flected for a moment, that as circum&s;tances alter ca&s;es, Gen. Wa&s;hington being now pre&s;&s;ed, and the army with him but feeble, he might po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h for &s;ome aid from his divi&s;ion.

<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A heavy cannonade was heard towards Amboy.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Col. Tupper, who was down near Tappan, got up to King's Ferry. He brought off the two 12 pounders which were at Dobb's Ferry, and a quan|tity of provi&s;ions. The &s;ame evening, our General ordered the Wa&s;hington Galley to take &s;tation at King's Ferry.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Our General gave orders for Clinton's and Scott's brigades to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to march to the Jer&s;ey &s;ide.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Scott's brigade was ordered over to Haver|&s;traw, and Col. Tyler's regiment, then at Ramapaugh River, to march down to Tappan, to &s;ecure and bring off the provi&s;ions which were at that place.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Capt Treadwell, of the artillery, with a three-pounder, was ordered to move over the river, and join Gen. Scott's brigade. It was learnt that many of the inhabitants of New-Jer&s;ey, e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of Hacken&s;ack, were &s;wearing allegiance to King George, taking letters of protec|tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Mr. Living&s;ton came from Congre&s;s, to advi&s;e with our General on mea&s;ures to ob&s;truct the river. The &s;ame day, Capt. Harrod brought off from Tappan, a con&s;iderable quantity of pearl-a&s;h, bees-wax, oil, &amp;c.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Two of the regiments of Gen. Clinton's brigade were ordered to move to Fort Con&s;titution,
<PB N="94" REF="94">
in order to attempt the forming of ob&s;tructions in the river near Polipins I&s;land.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Ju&s;t before dinner, Gen. Sullivan arrived at our General's quarters; and in the afternoon Gen. Lee arrived. He called at the door; when our General waiting upon him, reque&s;ted him to alight, he a&s;ked if he could have a cup of tea, and was an|&s;wered that he &s;hould have a good one. Upon com|ing into the hou&s;e, before he &s;at down, he wi&s;hed to &s;peak in private, which being in&s;tantly granted, he told our General that, in a military view, or, to u&s;e his own words exactly, "In <HI>point of law,</HI> you are right; but in point of policy, I think you are wrong. I am going into the Jer&s;ies for the &s;alvation of America; I wi&s;h to take with me a larger force than I now have, and reque&s;t you to order 2,000 of your men to march with me." Our General an&s;wered, that he could not &s;pare that number. He was then a&s;ked to order 1,000; to which he replied, that the bu&s;ine&s;s might be as well brought to a point at once&mdash;that not a &s;ingle man &s;hould march from the po&s;t by <HI>his</HI> order. Gen. Lee replied, that he would then or|der them him&s;elf. He was an&s;wered, that there was a wide difference between the two; that Gen. Lee was acknowledged by our General to be his &s;enior; but, as he had received po&s;itive written in&s;tructions from him who was &s;uperior to both, he would not <HI>him&s;elf</HI> break tho&s;e orders: If Gen. Lee was di&s;po&s;ed to counteract them, its being done by him could not be imputed to any other per&s;on; and that he knew the Commander in Chief did not intend any of the troops &s;hould be removed from that po&s;t&mdash;having expre&s;&s;ed it not only in his in&s;tructions, but al&s;o in a letter ju&s;t received from him. On the letter being &s;hewn to Gen. Lee, he ob&s;erved, "The Commander in Chief is now at a di&s;tance, and does not know what is nece&s;&s;ary here &s;o well as I do"&mdash;a&s;ked if he might
<PB N="95" REF="95">
be favoured with the return-book of the divi&s;ion. Major Huntington, the Deputy Adjutant-General, was directed to hand it. Gen. Lee ran his eye over it, and &s;aid, "I will take Pre&s;cott's and Wyllis's regiments"&mdash;and turning to Major Huntington, &s;aid, "You will order tho&s;e two regiments to march early to-morrow morning to join me." Our General, turn|ing to the Major, &s;aid, "I&s;&s;ue &s;uch orders at your peril!" and then turning to Gen. Lee, addre&s;&s;ed him: "Sir, if you come to this po&s;t, and mean to i&s;&s;ue or|ders here, which will break tho&s;e po&s;itive ones which I have received, I pray you to do it completely your|&s;elf, and through your own Deputy Adjutant-General, who is pre&s;ent, and not draw me, or any of my fam|ily, in as partners in the guilt." Gen. Lee replied, "It is right. Col. Scammel, do you i&s;&s;ue the order;" which he did, and Huntington communicated it to the regiments, who were now po&s;ted at the Gorge of the mountains, near Robin&s;on's Bridge, after|wards called the Continental Village. Matters car|ried thus far, our General turned to Gen. Lee again: "Sir, I have one more reque&s;t to make, and that is, that you will be plea&s;ed to give me a certificate, that you <HI>exerci&s;e command</HI> at this po&s;t, and do order from it Pre&s;cott's and Wyllis's regiments." Lee replied, "I do not know that I will comply with your re|que&s;t." Gen. Clinton, who was pre&s;ent, ob&s;erved, "Gen. Lee, you cannot refu&s;e a reque&s;t &s;o rea&s;ona|ble." Upon which Gen. Lee wrote as follows:</P>

<P>FOR the &s;atisfaction of Gen. Heath, and at his reque&s;t, I do certify, that I am commanding officer, at this pre&s;ent writing, in this po&s;t, and that I have, in that capacity, ordered Pre&s;cott's and Wyllis's regiments to march.</P>

Gen. Lee, &s;tepping out on the piazza, ob&s;erved to an officer, "Gen. Heath is right." Early the next morning, the regiments moved from their cantonment towards Peek's Kill; but before they had reached it, Gen. Lee, now ready to pa&s;s into the Jer&s;ies, rode up to our General's door, and calling him, ob&s;erved, "Upon further con&s;ideration, I have concluded not to take the two regiments with me&mdash;you may order them to return to their former po&s;t." This conduct of Gen. Lee's appeared not a little extraordinary, and one is almo&s;t at a lo&s;s to ac|count for it. He had been a &s;oldier from his youth, had a perfect knowledge of &s;ervice in all its branch|es, but was rather ob&s;tinate in his temper, and could &s;carcely brook being cro&s;&s;ed in any thing in the line of his profe&s;&s;ion. Gen. Lee took with him in|to the Jer&s;ies &s;ome as good troops as any in the &s;ervice; but many of them were &s;o de&s;titute of &s;hoes, that the blood left on the rugged frozen ground, in many places, marked the route they had taken; and a con&s;iderable number, unable to march, were left at Peek's Kill. The time of &s;ervice for which Gen. Scott's brigade was engaged to &s;erve, expired, when the whole, except about 50, went home, not|with&s;tanding the generous encouragement offered them by their State, (New-York) if they would con|tinue one month longer.</P>
<P>2d and 3d:&mdash;Gen. Lee's troops were pa&s;&s;ing the ferry. Gen. Carleton having returned into Canada, a number of Gen. Gates's regiments were now mov|ing to reinforce Gen. Wa&s;hington&mdash;their van as far as Morri&s;town&mdash;the enemy as far as Brun&s;wick.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the 4th, about &s;un&s;et, 70 &s;ail of &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports, pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ound towards New-England. Our General immediately &s;ent off expre&s;&s;es to Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, Gov. Trumbull, Mr. Bowdoin, at Bo&s;ton, the Convention of New-York, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="97">
7th:&mdash;Three regiments, viz. Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's, arrived off the landing from Albany, on their way to Gen. Wa&s;hington. Matters now looked &s;erious in Jer&s;ey. The Briti&s;h were extending them&s;elves in all directions, and the inhabitants obliged to become pa&s;&s;ive, if not wor&s;e. Gen. Gates had ordered the troops, moving from the northward, to rendezvous at Go&s;hen.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Our General wrote Gen. Lee, that the troops were moving on from the northward, and as Gen. Gates had not yet overtaken them, &s;ome of the commanding-officers appeared to wi&s;h for orders how to proceed. Gen. Wa&s;hington, it was &s;aid, was as far as Trenton&mdash;Lee, the preceding night, as far as Pompton. A flag &s;chooner came up from New-York, to obtain leave for &s;ome families to go in. A Par&s;on Ingli&s;h was on board. Orders were given to treat the flag with politene&s;s, and at the &s;ame time with proper precaution; and the bu&s;ine&s;s was laid before the Convention of the State.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, Gen. Clinton, with two Briti&s;h and two He&s;&s;ian brigades, with a &s;quadron of &s;hips under the command of Sir Peter Parker, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rhode-I&s;land; without the lo&s;s of a man; the Americans quitting the i&s;land without making any oppo&s;ition. Rhode-I&s;land was a great acqui&s;i|tion to the Briti&s;h, for quarters, forage, and a &s;afe harbour; but le&s;&s;ened their ability for other more important operations in the field.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 9th, our General received orders from the Commander in Chief, to move over the Hud&s;on, with Par&s;ons's brigade, and to move on &s;o as to give protection to the country, and vigour to the cau&s;e in Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;A little after noon, Par&s;ons's brigade march|ed down to King's Ferry; the greate&s;t alertne&s;s hav|ing
<PB N="98" REF="98">
been di&s;covered by both officers and men on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;About eleven o'clock, A. M. our General left Peek's Kill, and proceeded for the Jer&s;ies; on cro&s;&s;ing King's Ferry, gave orders for the flag to be detained from returning until further orders. The troops cro&s;&s;ed the ferry, and marched as far as Col. Hays' at Haver&s;traw. Huntington's and Tyler's regiments were ordered to advance from Ramapaugh Bridge to Paramus. Our General received a letter from Gen. Lee, in an&s;wer to the one he wrote on the 8th from Peek's Kill, as follows:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The foregoing letter appears very different from the former ones.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Early in the morning, the troops took up their line of march from Haver&s;traw, and before &s;un-&s;et reached Tappan.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="99">
13th.&mdash;Sent out a reconnoitring party towards Hacken&s;ack, to get intelligence, &amp;c. This day, Gen. Lee was taken pri&s;oner, near Chatham, by a party of light-hor&s;e, commanded by Col. Harcourt. Lee took quarters at a &s;mall di&s;tance from his troops: an in|habitant gave notice of it to Col. Harcourt, who was out reconnoitring near that neighbourhood, and who had the addre&s;s to take and carry him off.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Our General held up every appearance of moving to Paramus, and &s;ent off his baggage un|der e&s;cort to that place; and between 11 and 12 o'clock, marched bri&s;kly for Hacken&s;ack, having &s;ent orders for Huntington's and Tyler's regiments to move from Paramus at the &s;ame time. Bu&s;kirk's regiment was at Hacken&s;ack Bridge the preceding day, where they did duty, and it was expected they were &s;till at the &s;ame place. To &s;urpri&s;e and take them was the object; but it was found that Bu&s;kirk's men had moved the preceding day to Bergen, in or|der to draw new arms. The town was completely &s;urpri&s;ed, not having an idea that any but Briti&s;h troops were near them. One Briti&s;h &s;oldier and 20 or 30 of their adherents, were taken, a number of arms, &amp;c. and at the wharf, &s;everal ve&s;&s;els loaded with hay, &amp;c. on the point of &s;ailing for New-York. A brig had come to &s;ail in the morning, and run &s;ome di&s;tance down the river, and came to anchor. An officer with a party was &s;ent down to take her, and bring her up; but the wind was &s;o &s;trong a-head that it could not be effected. The officer was then directed to de&s;troy the ve&s;&s;el, as &s;he had a large quantity of forage on board, de&s;tined for New-York; but it was &s;aid, there were &s;ome valuable articles on board, which might be taken out and brought up in the boats. The orders were varied accordingly, with directions, that in ca&s;e the enemy advanced be|fore the bu&s;ine&s;s was completed, to &s;et the brig on
<PB N="100" REF="100">
fire. The boats brought up one load; but on re|turning to the brig, they di&s;covered a body of the enemy advancing, when the brig was abandoned without being &s;et on fire. The enemy immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her. Among the articles taken out, was a large che&s;t of plate. This was conveyed to Peek's Kill, and delivered to the Deputy Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General; and when the Briti&s;h afterwards de&s;troyed the public &s;tores at that place, the che&s;t of plate was removed by the Quarter-Ma&s;ter into Con|necticut; where afterwards Gen. Par&s;ons, in behalf of the officers and &s;oldiers of the divi&s;ion, filed a libel in the Maritime Court, and the officer who boarded the ve&s;&s;el, filed one in his own behalf. On trial, the Court adjudged the plate to the latter, although he boarded the ve&s;&s;el in obedience to expre&s;s orders. About 100 barrels of flour, which had been aban|doned by the Americans, when they retreated before Lord Cornwallis, were recovered and &s;ent off; and about 100 arms were al&s;o &s;ecured, with a quantity of rum, gin, &amp;c. In the evening, as two or three American officers were walking along the &s;treet, a gentleman, who was an inhabitant, came up to them, and expre&s;&s;ed his joy on the arrival of the troops, (&s;uppo&s;ing they were Briti&s;h.) The officers imme|diately conducted him to our General, and on en|tering the room informed him, that they came to introduce a friend who had joined them in the &s;treet, and who was able to give &s;ome important informa|tion. Our General expre&s;&s;ed a high &s;atisfaction, and wi&s;hed to know what information he could give. He replied, that he heard there was a large body of rebels collecting up above them. He was a&s;ked if, in ca&s;e the&s;e rebels &s;hould advance, any a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be afforded by the people of the town, and whether they could be depended on? He an&s;wered, there were a con&s;iderable number, and that they
<PB N="101" REF="101">
might be depended on. He was a&s;ked, whether there was not a number in the town who were in favour of the rebels? He an&s;wered, that there was; but that they had &s;eized and &s;ent off the principal ones among them, and that now the others dared not &s;hew them&s;elves. The joke was thus going on, when Col. Pre&s;cott, who &s;tood near him, holding his hat in his hand, in which there was a <HI>red cockade,</HI> (at that time a mark of the di&s;tinction of rank) the gentle|man fixed his eye upon it, and his countenance im|mediately fell. He was then told, that tho&s;e whom he termed <HI>rebels</HI> were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, and had now received his information. He was or|dered into cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;All the waggons in the vicinity were col|lected, and the flour and other &s;tores moved off to Paramus. Reconnoitring parties were &s;ent out to a di&s;tance, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;The effects were generally removed, and about noon the reconnoitring parties reported, that the enemy were advancing on both &s;ides of the place. They were &s;oon after di&s;covered by the guard at Acquackanuck Bridge. A little before &s;un-&s;et, the troops left the town. A &s;trong rear-guard was ordered to remain on the high ground back of the town, until after dark, to light up a number of fires, and then to move on after the troops. Ju&s;t be|fore the divi&s;ion left the town, Gen. George Clin|ton, attended by &s;ome light-hor&s;e, joined the di|vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Reconnoitring parties were &s;ent out on all the roads.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey militia had had a &s;kirmi&s;h with a body of Briti&s;h troops under Gen. Le&s;lie, near Springfield. Both parties retired. Of the militia, &s;everal were killed and wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="102">
The Convention of New-York, greatly alarmed at the removal of our General with the continental troops, from the important pa&s;&s;es of the High|lands, &s;ent a reque&s;t to Gen. Wa&s;hington, de&s;iring that they might be ordered back again. To in&s;ure di&s;patch, they offered the expre&s;s extra pay. The Commander in Chief was plea&s;ed to grant their re|que&s;t, and ordered our General to return to Peek's Kill, and re-occupy his former po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Our General, having received certain information that Bu&s;kirk's regiment was at or near Bergen Woods, it was determined to &s;trike them. For this purpo&s;e, on the evening of the 19th, about 8 o'clock, Gen. Par&s;ons, with 250 continental troops, and Gen. Clinton, with a like number of the militia of New-York, marched from Paramus church, and a covering party of 300 men was ordered to Tappan.</P>
<P>About 1 o'clock, the next morning, the detach|ment reached Bergen, and completely &s;urpri&s;ed the enemy's guard, making 22 men pri&s;oners. The regiment was alarmed, and a pretty bri&s;k &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued. The enemy were collecting, and it was judged be&s;t for the detachment to come off, having been &s;o far victorious.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;About 1 o'clock, P. M. the detachment returned to Paramus, having, in the &s;hort interval of time, marched (out and returning) upwards of 40 miles. They brought back with them, be&s;ides their pri&s;oners, 16 new fire-locks, 6 hor&s;es, and one waggon; having &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of one man. The enemy were &s;uppo&s;ed to have had &s;everal killed.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Orders were given for the troops to be ready to march early the next morning. The gentleman who was taken into cu&s;tody at Hacken|&s;ack, chagrined almo&s;t to death, had been &s;pending his time, like April, in weeping and lowering; and much interce&s;&s;ion having been made for his relea&s;e,
<PB N="103" REF="103">
our General told him, that in ca&s;e he would faith|fully perform a piece of &s;ecret &s;ervice allotted to him, he &s;hould be relea&s;ed. This he performed with punctuality, and con&s;equently was &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The troops marched from Paramus round by the &s;ide of Kakaat, to Clark's-Town, which they reached about &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;The troops took up their line of march, cro&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on, and arrived at Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Gave permi&s;&s;ion for the flag to return to New-York, having on board the families of Mr. Ingli&s;h, Moore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;It was learnt that a body of He&s;&s;ian troops had not long before moved to the upper end of York I&s;land. The militia of the State of New-York were this day beginning to come in.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;A &s;evere &s;now-&s;torm. Some of the militia from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had reached Danbury.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Providence, that a mo&s;t valuable prize, taken by the &s;hip Alfred, had arrived &s;afe at Bedford, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Col. Che&s;ter, of Connecticut, arrived at Peek's Kill, from Gen. Wa&s;hington's camp, with the agreeable news, that on the preceding Thur&s;day morning, being the 26th, Gen. Wa&s;hington, at the head of about 3,000 men, cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and attacked the enemy at Trenton, being about 1,600 He&s;&s;ians; and in about 35 minutes entirely defeated them. One Colonel, 2 Lieutenant-Colonels, 3 Ma|jors, 4 Captains, 8 Lieutenants, 12 En&s;igns, 1 Judge Advocate, 2 Surgeon's Mates, 92 Serjeants, 20 Drummers, 9 Mu&s;icians, 25 Officers' &s;ervants, and 740 rank and file were taken pri&s;oners, be&s;ides the killed and wounded. Six pieces of bra&s;s cannon, 12 drums, 4 &s;tandards, 1200 &s;mall-arms, 6 waggons, a number of &s;words, caps, &amp;c. were the trophies of
<PB N="104" REF="104">
victory. The &s;ame day, Colonel Sparhawk's regi|ment of militia arrived from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Information was given, that a company of 60 di&s;affected inhabitants were on their way to join the enemy. Parties were &s;ent out to intercept them.</P>
<P>1777. <HI>January</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;By a letter from General Wa&s;hington, it appeared that the enemy were re|treating towards Amboy. Generals Mifflin and Er|ving, and Col. Cadwallader had cro&s;&s;ed the Dela|ware, and Gen. Wa&s;hington was about to follow them, and pur&s;ue the enemy.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Several infamous di&s;affected per&s;ons were taken and &s;ent in. The &s;ame day, Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton being at Trenton, Gen. Howe advanced to at|tack him; a cannonade en&s;ued: Gen. Wa&s;hington retired to the other &s;ide of the Mill Creek; and, as &s;oon as it was dark, ordering a great number of fires to be lighted up, to deceive the enemy, &s;tole a march, and at 9 o'clock next morning attacked three regi|ments of the enemy, who were po&s;ted at Princetown, routed them, driving them from two &s;mall redoubts. The enemy lo&s;t, in killed, wounded and taken pri&s;|oners about 500. The American lo&s;s was incon&s;id|erable, except in the brave Gen. Mercer, of Vir|ginia, who fell in this action, greatly regretted. In this manoeuvre and action Gen. Wa&s;hington exhib|ited the mo&s;t con&s;ummate general&s;hip, and the Brit|i&s;h were &s;truck with con&s;ternation. <HI>Ambu&s;cade, &s;ur|pri&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;tratagem</HI> are &s;aid to con&s;titute the &s;ublime part of the art of war, and that he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the greate&s;t re&s;ource in the&s;e, will eventually pluck the laurel from the brow of his opponent. The &s;trata|gems of war are almo&s;t infinite, but all have the &s;ame object, namely, to deceive&mdash;to hold up an appear|ance of &s;omething which is not intended, while un|der this ma&s;k &s;ome important object is &s;ecured; and be a General never &s;o brave, if he be un&s;killed in

the arts and &s;tratagems of war, he is really to be pitied; for his bravery will but &s;erve to lead him in|to tho&s;e wily &s;nares which are laid for him.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;Thirty-&s;even recruits going to Rogers, taken the preceding night, were brought in; and our Gen|eral ordered out Capt. Graham at 12 o'clock at night, to intercept another gang.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Gen. Lincoln arrived from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; he had come on with a body of militia.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;It was learnt that on the 1&s;t in&s;t. Gen. Put|nam took a large quantity of baggage, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. at Bordentown; and on the 3d, Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton's army came up with the rear of the enemy, at or near Rocky Hill, when a bri&s;k action en&s;ued, and the enemy were defeated, with the lo&s;s of between 50 and 60 killed, and upwards of 100 taken pri&s;on|ers, together with 6 pieces of cannon, and all their baggage: the Americans had 6 men killed. The &s;ame day, Col. Sparhawk's regiment of militia, from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, with two field-pieces, marched for King's Ferry, on their way to the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Our General received the following letter from Gen. Wa&s;hington:</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have made a &s;ucce&s;sful attack upon Prince|ton. General Howe advanced upon Trenton; we evacuated the town, and lay at the other &s;ide of the Mill Creek until dark; then &s;tole a march, and at|tacked Princeton about 9 o'clock in the morning. There were three regiments quartered there. The killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners taken, amounted to about 500. The enemy are in great con&s;ternation; and as the pre&s;ent affords us a favourable opportu|nity to drive them out of the Jer&s;ies, it has been de|termined in Council, that you &s;hould move down to|wards
<PB N="106" REF="106">
New-York with a con&s;iderable force, as if you had a de&s;ign upon the city; that being an object of great importance, the enemy will be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of withdrawing a con&s;iderable part of their force from the Jer&s;ies, if not the whole, to &s;ecure the city. I &s;hall draw the force on this &s;ide the North River together at Morri&s;town, where I &s;hall watch the motions of the enemy, and avail my&s;elf of every circum&s;tance. You will retain 4,000 of the mi|litia, coming on from the New-England Govern|ments for the expedition. You will act with great precaution, but avail your&s;elf of every favourable opportunity of attacking the enemy, when you can do it to advantage.</P>
<P>Gen. Lincoln mu&s;t cro&s;s the North River, and come on with the remainder of the militia to Morri&s;town. Leave a &s;ufficient guard at the High|lands.</P>
<P>You will al&s;o have as many boats collected to|gether, or in &s;uch a manner as you may always avail your&s;elf of them, if it &s;hould be found expedient for your troops or any part of them to cro&s;s the North River, at Dobb's Ferry, or any other of the landings.</P>

<P>Preparations for the before mentioned movement were immediately put in train. The militia and volunteers were coming in.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Gen. Par&s;ons went down to King-&s;treet.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;The remainder of Col. Sparhawk's and Col. Whitney's regiments pa&s;&s;ed over the river, to join Gen. Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Col. Fro&s;t's regiment marched to North-Ca&s;tle, and Gen. Scott's militia to White Plains.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="107">
11th.&mdash;A number of Briti&s;h officers, taken at Princeton, pa&s;&s;ed Peek's Kill, on their way to Con|necticut. The &s;ame day it was learnt, that on the 8th, Gen. Maxwell, with the Jer&s;ey militia, and &s;ome continental troops, routed the enemy at Eliz|abeth-Town, where he took 50 Highlanders, a &s;chooner loaded with baggage, and fell in with a party of 30 Waldeckers, whom he al&s;o took pri&s;|oners.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Gen. Moulton from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Col. Gilman from New-Hamp&s;hire, came to camp. A number of Briti&s;h pri&s;oners, taken in the Jer&s;ies, pa&s;&s;ed Peek's Kill, on their way to Connecticut.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Our General moved to the &s;outhward, and reached North-Ca&s;tle ju&s;t before &s;un-&s;et, where he found part of four regiments had arrived, and Gen. Scott's militia of New-York had moved down to Wright's Mills.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Our General moved to King-&s;treet to Mr. Clap's&mdash;about 3,000 militia had arrived, and Gen. Lincoln's divi&s;ion marched to Tarrytown on this day. The Commander in Chief in another letter had intimated that Gen. Lincoln, in&s;tead of moving on to join him, &s;hould &s;tay on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, and join in the expedition.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;The Connecticut volunteers marched from King-&s;treet to New Rochelle, and Gen. Scott's brigade to Stephen Ward's. Plenty of provi&s;ions were arriving. A de&s;erter came in from the enemy, and gave an account of their &s;ituation and num|bers.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;At night the three divi&s;ions began to move towards King&s;bridge; Gen Lincoln's, from Tarry|town, on the Albany road; Generals Woo&s;ter and Par&s;ons's, from New Rochelle and Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter, and Gen. Scott's in the centre from below White Plains.
<PB N="108" REF="108">
The &s;everal di&s;tances and rate of marching were &s;o we calculated, that, on the 18th, ju&s;t before &s;un|ri&s;e, the three divi&s;ions, although &s;o far apart, ar|rived at the out-po&s;ts of the enemy almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant. Gen. Lincoln's on the heights above Col. Van Cortland's; Woo&s;ter's at Williams's; and Scott's on the back of Volentine's. Our General, who moved with the centre divi&s;ion, knew that Vol|entine's hou&s;e was the quarters of one of the guards; he did not know but it might be defended: as he approached it, he ordered Capt. Lieut. Bryant to ad|vance a field-piece to the advance-guard, and if there was any oppo&s;ition from the hou&s;e, to cannonade it immediately. He then ordered 250 men from the head of the column (as it was moving on) to incline to the right, and by a double &s;tep to pu&s;h into the hollow, between the hou&s;e and the fort, to cut off the guard who were at the hou&s;e, in ca&s;e they &s;hould run towards the latter. At this in&s;tant, two light-hor&s;emen who had been &s;ent out by the enemy as the day broke to reconnoitre the vicinity, came unexpectedly at the de&s;cent of a hill, plump upon the head of Woo&s;ter's column. They attempted to turn about, but before it could be fully effected, a field-piece was di&s;charged at them; one of them was pitched from his hor&s;e and taken pri&s;oner, the other galloped back to the fort, holloing as he pa&s;&s;ed, "The rebels! The rebels!" This &s;et all the out|guards and pickets running to the fort, leaving in &s;ome places their arms, blankets, tools, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. behind them. Tho&s;e who fled from Volentine's, and the <HI>Negro Fort,</HI> were fired at as they ran, but none were killed: one, who could not run &s;o fa&s;t as the re&s;t, was taken pri&s;oner. Ten mu&s;quets were taken at Volentine's hou&s;e. The guard above Van Cortland's was as completely &s;urpri&s;ed as the others,
<PB N="109" REF="109">
where Gen. Lincoln took about 40 arms, &s;ome blan|kets, &amp;c. &amp;c. The left and centre divi&s;ions moved into the hollow, between Volentine's hou&s;e and the fort, from whence our General immediately &s;ent a &s;ummons to the commanding-officer of the fort to &s;urrender. The Commandant of the fort, and a con|&s;iderable part of the garri&s;on, being He&s;&s;ians, the &s;ummons held out to the&s;e generous terms. The an&s;wer, which was verbal, was a refu&s;al to &s;urrender. A detachment with two field-pieces was ordered to move to the &s;outh of the fort, to a hill above Haar|lem Creek, not far from the New Bridge. When the detachment arrived at this place, a battalion of He&s;&s;ians appeared drawn up on the &s;ide of the hill ju&s;t within King&s;bridge, and back of Hyatt's tavern. Our General ordered the artillery to cannonade them immediately. The fir&s;t &s;hot ju&s;t cleared the right of the battalion, nearly a platoon &s;ettling down as the &s;hot pa&s;&s;ed them, which entered the bank clo&s;e be|hind them. The &s;econd &s;hot pa&s;&s;ed about the centre of the battalion, when to the amount of a grand di|vi&s;ion &s;ettled down, which was an evidence that they would not &s;tand much longer. One of the pieces was ordered to be drawn lower down the hill; on which the battalion quitted their ground, and marched off as fa&s;t as they could without run|ning, to get behind the redoubt and hill at the bridge, receiving one &s;hot more as they were turn|ing round the point. It was not &s;u&s;pected that the enemy had any cannon in the redoubt within the bridge, but they now began to cannonade the artil|lery-men who had de&s;cended the hill, who had to draw up their piece as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, which they ef|fected without any lo&s;s, but received three or four &s;hot quite among them, before they could reach the top of the hill.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="110">
This &s;ucce&s;s at the out-po&s;ts flew through the country, and was &s;oon magnified to a reduction of the fort, and capture of the garri&s;on. It reached Gen. Wa&s;hington long before the official account, and he had communicated the report to Congre&s;s; hence a double di&s;appointment, when the true &s;tate of facts was received.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The enemy cannonaded from the fort, and killed one American, as the guards were relieving at the Negro Fort. It was determined to make an at|tempt to cut off the battalion within King&s;bridge, early the next morning, by pa&s;&s;ing a &s;trong detach|ment over Spitten-Devil Creek on the ice, which, however, was not now very &s;trong, but the weather was cold. One thou&s;and were detached for the pur|po&s;e; but the weather having grown warm in the night, the ice was judged, by the unanimous opinion of all the General Officers on the ground, to be too hazardous on the morning of the 20th to venture the attempt. On this day there was a cannonade on both &s;ides, and the enemy on the i&s;land &s;ide were thrown into much confu&s;ion. Our General ob&s;erv|ing that when the enemy within the i&s;land were can|nonaded acro&s;s Haarlem Creek, they &s;heltered them|&s;elves behind the little hill near the bridge, next to Spitten-Devil Creek, on this afternoon he rode round on to Tippit's Hill, which was in its rear, and found that a field-piece drawn up on that &s;ide would leave the enemy no hiding place.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A cannonade on both &s;ides. In the after|noon a field-piece was hauled up to Tippit's Hill, and the enemy were cannonaded both in front and rear: they were thrown into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion: &s;ome &s;ecured them&s;elves in their redoubt, others un|der the banks: &s;ome lay flat on the ground, and &s;ome betook them&s;elves to the cellars; &s;o that in a
<PB N="111" REF="111">
&s;hort time there was no object for the gunners. The weather had now grown very moderate.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;There was a pretty &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h with the enemy near the fort. This day our General ordered a number of chandeliers, fa&s;cines, &amp;c. to be made; and having nothing but light field-pieces with him, in order to keep up an appearance of a &s;erious de&s;ign on the fort, he &s;ent to North-Ca&s;tle, where was a <HI>field</HI> bra&s;s 24-pounder and &s;ome howitzers, to bring forward the former and one of the latter.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;A &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h took place ju&s;t before du&s;k, in the broken ground near the &s;outh &s;ide of the fort; an En&s;ign and one man belonging to the New-York militia were killed, and five wounded; the lo&s;s of the enemy unknown, as it was clo&s;e under the fort.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Exce&s;&s;ive &s;tormy. Gen. Lincoln's divi&s;ion, who were in huts in the woods, back of Col. Van Cortland's, were obliged to quit their ground, and move back into hou&s;es where they could find them; &s;ome of them as far as Dobb's Ferry; with the lo&s;s of a great many cartridges, from the badne&s;s of the boxes. The fall of rain was &s;o great as to cau&s;e a great fre&s;h in the Brunx, the water running over the bridge by Williams's.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Early in the morning, the enemy made a &s;ally towards Delaney's Mills, where they &s;urpri&s;ed and routed the guard, wounding &s;everal, but not killing or taking any of them; and a regiment near that place quitted their quarters. Emboldened by this &s;ucce&s;s, about 10 o'clock, A. M. they made a powerful &s;ally towards Volentine's, in&s;tantly driving the guards and pickets from the Negro Fort and Volentine's hou&s;e; pu&s;hing on with great impetuo&s;ity, keeping up a bri&s;k fire, the balls pa&s;&s;ing at Williams's hou&s;e &s;ufficiently &s;trong to do execution. The retreating
<PB N="112" REF="112">
guards threw them&s;elves into the old redoubt on the north &s;ide of the road, to the we&s;t of the bridge; on which, the enemy immediately lined a &s;trong &s;tone wall, a few rods di&s;tant to the &s;outhwe&s;t. Two regiments of the militia being at this in&s;tant formed in the road near Williams's, and the hor&s;es in the limbers of the field-pieces, our General ordered Capt. Bryant to ford over the bridge with his piece, and the militia to follow and cover the artillery. When Capt. Bryant had a&s;cended almo&s;t to the top of the hill, to prevent his hor&s;es being &s;hot, he un|limbered, and the men took the drag-ropes; but the a&s;cent of the hill was &s;uch, that they were obliged to drag the piece almo&s;t within pi&s;to-&s;hot, before the ground would admit the plece to be &s;o depre&s;&s;ed as to bear on the enemy. The moment this was effect|ed, a round &s;hot opened a breach in the wall, four or five feet wide; a &s;econd &s;hot in le&s;s than a minute opened another, when the enemy &s;led back to the fort with the greate&s;t precipitation. Of the Ameri|cans, two were killed and a number wounded.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The bra&s;s 24-pounder and howitzer were brought up, and ordered to open upon the fort; on the third di&s;charge of the former, &s;he &s;prang her car|riage; nor were there any <HI>live</HI> &s;hells for the howit|zer, there being none at North-Ca&s;tle; nor was a regular cannonade or bombardment of the fort ever contemplated. Every attempt was now made, by feint and otherwi&s;e, to draw the enemy out of the fort. A detachment was &s;ent down to Morri&s;ania, to light up a great number of fires in the night, to induce the enemy to &s;uppo&s;e that a body of Ameri|cans were collecting at that place, with a de&s;ign to cro&s;s on to New-York I&s;land, at or near Haarlem; and to heighten this, &s;everal large boats were &s;ent for, and brought forward on carriages. The Briti&s;h
<PB N="113" REF="113">
guard on Montre&s;or's I&s;land were &s;o much alarmed at this, as to &s;et the buildings on fire, and flee to New-York. A brigade of the Briti&s;h were &s;aid to have moved towards Fort Wa&s;hington; and orders had been &s;ent to Rhode-I&s;land, for a detachment to be &s;ent from thence.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;There was the appearance of a &s;evere &s;now-&s;torm coming on, when all the General Officers on the ground, viz. be&s;ides our General, <HI>Lincoln, Woo&s;ter, Scott</HI> and <HI>Ten Broeck,</HI> were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the troops ought to move back before the &s;torm came on, to places where they could be covered from the inclemency of the weather, as there was no artillery to batter the fort, and from fir&s;t to la&s;t they were unanimou&s;ly oppo&s;ed to any idea of an a&s;&s;ault or &s;torm of the &s;ort with the mi|litia, and the principal object being now to &s;ecure and bring off or de&s;troy the forage, which could be as well done where the troops could have covering, as to ha|ra&s;s them in the open fields by multiplying guards, or their being con&s;tantly expo&s;ed in the &s;cattered hou&s;es to be &s;urpri&s;ed and cut off. For the&s;e &s;everal rea|&s;ons, the troops were ordered as &s;oon as it grew dark to move back, Gen. Lincoln's divi&s;ion to Dobb's Ferry and Tarry-Town, Gen. Woo&s;ter's to New Rochelle, and Gen. Scott's to White Plains; the guards to remain at their po&s;ts and alert, until the troops were all moved off, and then to form rear guards on the &s;everal roads, following the troops to whom they re&s;pectively belonged; all of which was performed in good order, in a very heavy fall of &s;now.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;The &s;torm cleared up, when 15 &s;hips, 1 brig, 2 &s;chooners, and 2 &s;loops came too, between Heart and City I&s;lands; they were from the ea&s;t|ward, and were &s;uppo&s;ed to have troops on board.
<PB N="114" REF="114">
The troops on this expedition, as it was called, were in a very hazardous &s;ituation, and had continued in it from the morning of the 18th to the evening of the 29th; they were entirely a body of militia, ex|cept a few artillery-men. So apprehen&s;ive of this being a critical &s;ituation was the Commander in Chief, in the year 1780, when Gen. Sir Henry Clinton menaced the French army at Rhode-I&s;land, and had embarked his troops on board tran&s;ports for the purpo&s;e of proceeding to that place, and Gen. Wa&s;hington had determined to move down towards King&s;bridge, to induce Sir Henry to give up his de&s;ign by menacing New-York, our General being then at Rhode-I&s;land with the French army, Gen. Wa&s;hington wrote him on the 31&s;t of July from Robin&s;on's Hou&s;e in the Highlands&mdash;among other things, <HI>"You know the critical &s;ituation in which this army will be in a po&s;ition below."</HI> This was undoubtedly a very ju&s;t ob&s;ervation; but if the Commander in Chief, with the whole American army in 1780, well armed and highly di&s;ciplined, &s;hould &s;o ju&s;tly judge at the di&s;tance of 30 miles from the &s;pot, what &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e brave mi|litia men, who continued in the po&s;ition it&s;elf, for more than <HI>ten days</HI> in the mid&s;t of winter.</P>
<P>Whenever an enterpri&s;e is to be attempted in the teeth of an enemy, it &s;hould be a <HI>da&s;h</HI> and away.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;A <HI>cordon</HI> of troops was ordered to be form|ed, to extend from Dobb's Ferry to Maroneck.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Foraging being now the object, a large number of teams were &s;ent out towards Maroneck, and upwards of 80 loads of forage were brought off. Twelve more &s;hips, 4 of which were of 40 guns, came down the Sound the preceding day.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Col. Humphries, of New-York, arrived with a regiment of militia from Albany county, to con|tinue in &s;ervice &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="115">
3d.&mdash;There was another grand forage.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;A &s;trong detachment under the command of Col. Enos was &s;ent toward Fort Independence, to attempt to &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome of the enemy's out-po&s;ts, but nothing could be effected. The &s;mall-pox was now making its appearance in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;There was a grand forage to the lower parts of We&s;t-Che&s;ter county. A row-galley and a &s;loop were coming up the North River. The covering party to the foragers on this day was nearly 1,000 &s;trong, and large quantities of forage were brought off.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Our General rode to Peek's Kill, where he arrived a little after dark. Gen. Lincoln's troops were on their march to join Gen. Wa&s;hington. Our General had obtained leave of the Commander in Chief, to make a &s;hort vi&s;it to New-England, un|der an injunction to return very early.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;About 10 o'clock, he left Peck's Kill, and arrived at his hou&s;e in Roxbury on the 19th, about &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 14th.&mdash;Our General &s;et out from Roxbu|ry, on his way back to the army; but before he had got to Watertown, an expre&s;s overtook him, with orders from Gen.

<P>This year, 1777, formed an important era in the annals of America. Congre&s;s had determined to make great exertions to drive the Briti&s;h troops from America; for this purpo&s;e, they had ordered 88 battalions to be rai&s;ed in the United States, 15 of which fell to the &s;hare of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Be&s;ides the foregoing 88 battalions, they al&s;o ordered the

<P>20th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Ward re&s;igned the command of the Ea&s;tern Department to our General, who took the command accordingly.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;A detachment of Briti&s;h troops, con&s;i&s;ting as was &s;aid of about 500 men, de&s;troyed the Ameri|can &s;tores at Peek's Kill; they met with but very little oppo&s;ition: here our General lo&s;t a part of his baggage, which was left when he came away for Bo&s;ton, in February. Mon&s;ieur De Bore, a French General, came to Bo&s;ton: he had been engaged by our Mini&s;ters in France, to enter the American &s;er|vice, &amp;c.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Our General received orders from the Commander in Chief, to make an alteration in the de&s;tination of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiments, &s;ending eight of the regiments to Peek's Kill, and &s;even to Ticonderoga.</P>

<P>9th.&mdash;About 120 men of Patter&s;on's regiment marched for Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;A part of Nixon's regiment marched for Peek's Kill; on the 12th, 160 men of Bayley's for Ticonderoga; and on the 13th, 200 of We&s;&s;on's for the latter place. The &s;ame day, began to inoculate the recruits at Pro&s;pect Hill.</P>

29th.&mdash;An expre&s;s arrived from Gov. Trumbull, giving an account that the enemy had landed a body of men near Fairfield, and that a number of &s;hips were &s;tanding up Hud&s;on's River. This body of the enemy con&s;i&s;ted of about 2,000; they landed on the 25th at Fairfield, and pu&s;hed for Danbury, where the Americans had magazines of &s;tores, which the Briti&s;h burnt and de&s;troyed. Generals Woo&s;ter and Arnold were in that part of Connecticut; they a&s;|&s;embled the militia of the vicinity, and attacked the Briti&s;h on their return; and there were &s;everal very &s;harp &s;kirmi&s;hes, at and near Ridgfield, in one of which the brave Gen.

<P><HI>May</HI> 5th.&mdash;Col. Jack&s;on's Independent Company returned from doing duty at Providence.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Gen. Du Condray, an experienced French artillery officer, engaged by our Commi&s;&s;ioners in France, to act at the head of the American artillery, arrived at Bo&s;ton: on viewing, from Beacon Hill, the &s;ituation of Bo&s;ton, and the American works around the town, he made a laught at the Briti&s;h leaving the town when under no greater danger; adding, that the force which they had, might have defended the place again&s;t an army of 50,000 men. A valuable prize, loaded with dry goods, was &s;ent into Newbury-Port.</P>

21&s;t.&mdash;The continental frigates, and a fleet of pri|vate &s;hips of war, &s;ailed on a cruize, with a fair wind.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a detach|ment of Americans, under the command of Colonel Meigs, of Connecticut, had pa&s;&s;ed the Sound on the 23d to Long-I&s;land, and cro&s;&s;ed to Sagg Harbour, where they de&s;troyed and burnt a number of ve&s;&s;els at the wharf, and every thing on &s;hore, and brought off 80 or 90 pri&s;oners. This enterpri&s;e was con|ducted with much addre&s;s and great expedition.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;A prize brig was &s;ent in, laden with &s;alt, cordage, &amp;c. She was from Top&s;ham in England. No reinforcement for the army in America had &s;ail|ed the la&s;t of March.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 8th.&mdash;Two prizes were &s;ent in; one laden with coals, the other with dry goods.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;A 50 gun &s;hip of the enemy, and two frig|ates were cruizing in our bay.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;A prize taken by Commodore Manly, la|den with duck, cordage, &amp;c. and two brigs from Bil|boa, arrived &s;afe.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that General Howe evacuated Brun&s;wick on the 18th of the pre|ceding month; he had before advanced as far as Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e, and had thrown up a number of works, which he abandoned: the American light troops hara&s;&s;ed his rear. This day, four of the ene|my's cruizers came &s;o near in, as to be di&s;covered from Nanta&s;ket.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;The anniver&s;ary of the Independence of the United States was celebrated with proper demon|&s;trations of joy.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;An expre&s;s arrived from Peek's Kill, with intelligence from Gen. Wa&s;hington, intimating that on the morning of the 1&s;t in&s;t. the enemy's fleet which lay at Amboy &s;ailed down round that town;
<PB N="120" REF="120">
and that the troops who lay encamped oppo&s;ite to the town, &s;truck their tents and marched off. The enemy were al&s;o advancing on the Lake with their fleet towards Ticonderoga. A detachment of &s;ol|diers for Col. M. Jack&s;on's regiment marched for the northern army.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Capt. Clu&s;ton arrived from France, with powder, arms, &amp;c. for the State; he had al&s;o made a &s;ucce&s;sful cruize.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Amer|icans evacuated Ticonderoga on the 6th, at night; a great many &s;tores, &amp;c. were lo&s;t. The Briti&s;h no &s;ooner arrived before Ticonderoga, than they were di&s;covered on Mount Hope: this &s;teep and rugged hill was thought to be inacce&s;&s;ible by the Americans, at lea&s;t with artillery; and therefore, notwith&s;tand|ing its nearne&s;s to the works, and overlooking of them in part, it was not taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; but they &s;hould have recollected what had been &s;aid by the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as to &s;uch po&s;itions&mdash;that "where a goat can go, a man may go; and where a man can go, artillery may be drawn up." The Brit|i&s;h were no &s;ooner &s;een on this hill, where the <HI>wily Phillips</HI> of the artillery is &s;aid to have a&s;cended, than they &s;aw an additional rea&s;on for quitting the po&s;t. This was a &s;ore and heavy lo&s;s to the Americans; but in the i&s;&s;ue proved a more certain and earlier overthrow of all Burgoyne's army: yet &s;o exa&s;pe|rated were the people at that time, that had the commanding General, St. Clair, been immediately brought to trial, he would have &s;tood but a poor chance: he was afterwards tried and acquitted with honour. The Briti&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the works, and pu&s;hed on rapidly after the Americans, taking and de&s;troying every thing that fell in their way. Brig. Gen. Frazer, with the light troops, pur&s;ued
<PB N="121" REF="121">
with great ardour, and on the 7th came up with a body of the Americans commanded by the brave Col. Francis, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. A warm action en|&s;ued; the Americans were wor&s;ted; the Colonel was &s;lain, and many other officers and &s;oldiers kill|ed, wounded and taken pri&s;oners. This flew through the country like a &s;hock of electricity, and rou&s;ed the people to noble exertions. Gen. St. Clair join|ed Gen. Schuyler, at Fort Edward, after a fatiguing retreat. On the 10th, a mo&s;t con&s;picuous piece of gallantry was exhibited at Rhode-I&s;land. Maj. Gen. Pre&s;cott having the command of the Briti&s;h troops at that place, Col. Barton of Providence formed a re&s;olution to &s;urpri&s;e and take him: he accordingly proceeded to the i&s;land with a party of cho&s;en men in two boats with muffled oars, taking with him a negro man who&s;e hard head was nearly as efficacious as a beetle, to bur&s;t a door; and on this night with great addre&s;s evading the Briti&s;h water-guards, pa&s;&s;|ed down the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and landed near a hollow ground, and in&s;tantly pu&s;hed for the hou&s;e of a Mr. <HI>Overing,</HI> where the General quarter|ed. The centinel at the door was &s;eized, the hou&s;e entered, and demand made whether the General was there; and finding that he was, and the apartment, the door was bur&s;t open, and the General and his Aid-de-camp &s;eized, and told that they mu&s;t go off in&s;tantly. The General a&s;ked if he might put on his clothes? The Colonel an&s;wered, <HI>"very few, and very quick, Sir."</HI> The Colonel returned to his boats, and repa&s;&s;ed the water-guards, which the General had much confidence would have relea&s;ed him; for on pa&s;&s;ing the la&s;t, he ob&s;erved to the Colonel, "Sir, I did not think it po&s;&s;ible you could e&s;cape the vigi|lance of the water-guards." This was a brilliant affair; and Congre&s;s duly rewarded Col. Barton for his di&s;tingui&s;hed addre&s;s and gallantry.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="122">
13th.&mdash;An expre&s;s arrived from Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton, with information that the Briti&s;h were preparing their tran&s;ports for the embarkation of their troops from Staten I&s;land, were fixing births for the light-hor&s;e, &amp;c. but their de&s;tination could not be devel|oped. They had pu&s;hed into the Jer&s;ies, as if de|&s;igning to march to Philadelphia, and then turned back, as has been mentioned, from Amboy, and now were preparing to embark; and we &s;hall anon &s;ee more of their manoeuvres and deceptions.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;A number of Americans, who had left the northern army when it retreated, as is generally the ca&s;e on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, came to Bo&s;ton; they were immediately taken up and confined, to be &s;ent back again: the be&s;t method in like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;At evening an expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed through Bo&s;|ton, on his way to Philadelphia, with di&s;patches which had been brought to Port&s;mouth, (N. H.) by a ve&s;&s;el in 42 days pa&s;&s;age from France. It was &s;aid that there was great probability of an immediate war between France and England.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;By intelligence from Peek's Kill it was learnt, that on the preceding Wedne&s;day 10 pieces of cannon were &s;hipped for Albany; that a divi&s;ion of the American army was oppo&s;ite to Fi&s;hkill; and that General Wa&s;hington was moving towards King's Ferry with the main army, &s;aid to be 20,000 &s;trong, with near 800 waggons, and having a num|ber of flat-bottomed boats on carriages, &amp;c.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Count Pola&s;ki, a Poli&s;h nobleman, came to Bo&s;ton, and dined at head-quarters.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Information was &s;ent from Cape Ann, that a fleet of ve&s;&s;els, &s;aid to be near 100, had been &s;een from the high lands, &s;tanding to the northward. This cau&s;ed &s;ome alarm: the guards at the maga|zines, &amp;c. were doubled.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="123">
4th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that Gen. Wa&s;h|ington was moving with the main army towards Philadelphia, and had detached Gen. Glover with his brigade to join the northern army. An account was received that there had been a &s;kirmi&s;h on Wood Creek, between a party of the Americans and the enemy, to the advantage of the former.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that the American northern army had fallen back to Saratoga. About this time, a party of the enemy landed on Bo&s;ton Neck (&s;o called) in Rhode-I&s;land: they were driven off without doing much damage. The &s;ame day in|telligence was received, that on the 23d of the pre|ceding month the Briti&s;h fleet &s;ailed from Sandy Hook, and had arrived off the Capes of Delaware.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h fleet &s;ailed out of the Capes of Delaware on the 31&s;t alt. &s;tanding to the ea&s;tward. This induced Gen. Wa&s;hington to retrograde the main American army towards the North River.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;There was a report that the northern ar|my had fallen back to Stillwater. One &s;ixth part of the militia in a number of the counties of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts were ordered to be detached and marched im|mediately to reinforce the northern army.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h fleet had returned again to the Capes of Dela|ware. Col. John&s;on and St. Leger were advancing with a body of the enemy towards Fort Schuyler, on the Mohawk River.</P>
<P>About this time, a Mi&s;s M'Crea, &s;aid to be a beau|tiful young lady, and in all the innocence of youth, her father warmly engaged on the &s;ide of the Brit|i&s;h, and &s;he on the very point of marriage with a Briti&s;h officer, on &s;ome di&s;pute between two Indians, as to which of them &s;he of right belonged as a cap|tive,
<PB N="124" REF="124">
&s;he was mo&s;t inhumanly ma&s;&s;acred! The act was probably as abhorrent to the Briti&s;h as to the Americans; but they ought not to have engaged the &s;avages in their cau&s;e, as they might well have known their ungovernable temper, and di&s;po&s;ition for blood; for this was not the only in&s;tance. A Briti&s;h officer &s;ending his waiter to a &s;pring for &s;ome cool water, in a few minutes an Indian came in, with the &s;calp of the waiter &s;moaking in his hand.</P>
<P>St. Leger having gone up the Mohawk to reduce Fort Schuyler, Gen. Burgoyne determined to &s;end out another &s;trong detachment on his left, towards Bennington. The command of this detachment was given to Lieut. Col. Baum, a He&s;&s;ian; and Col. Breyman, with another detachment, was ordered to cover and &s;upport Baum. The&s;e were met by the brave Gen. Stark, who gave them a complete over|throw. On the morning of the 16th, 32 officers and near 700 men were taken pri&s;oners, with 4 light field-pieces, nearly 1,000 arms, a quantity of bag|gage, &amp;c. The Americans were &s;aid to have had about 25 men killed: the lo&s;s of the enemy in killed was judged to be nearly 200. Fort Schuyler was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by St. Leger; and the brave Col. Harkimer, with the Tryon county militia, was march|ing to its relief. St. Leger learning his advance, drew off a large part of his be&s;ieging troops, to meet and give him battle, before he got near the fort: the battle was ob&s;tinate, and the militia behaved with great bravery, but were at length defeated; their brave Colonel and many of the militia were &s;lain: it was &s;aid that the action la&s;ted 5 or 6 hours. Matters now appearing more &s;erious in this quarter, Gen. Arnold marched with a &s;ufficient detachment to rai&s;e the &s;iege. As &s;oon as St. Leger learnt his approach, he &s;ent off &s;ome Indians, as if friends to
<PB N="125" REF="125">
meet Arnold, and inform him that St. Leger had received a &s;trong reinforcement, and advi&s;ed Arnold to halt and wait for a reinforcement him&s;elf&mdash;then abandoned the &s;iege with precipitation, leaving his tents &s;tanding, his baggage, artillery, &amp;c. behind him. Thus were both Burgoyne's wings effectually clipped.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that af|ter much manoeuvring, Howe's fleet came to anchor in Che&s;apeak Bay, on the 21&s;t ult. con&s;i&s;ting of near 200 &s;ail, and it was expected he would &s;oon land his troops. The 24th, Gen. Wa&s;hington's army was on full march to meet Howe, and then within 5 miles of Philadelphia. A valuable cargo arrived &s;afe from Spain; among other articles, a large number of &s;hoes, ho&s;e, blankets, &s;hirts, cordage, duck, &amp;c.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Gen. Howe's army had landed at the Head of Elk. A detach|ment from Gen. Sullivan's divi&s;ion a little before this time made an excur&s;ion on to Staten-I&s;land, and brought off &s;everal hundred pri&s;oners, and a large quantity of baggage. The American lo&s;s was &s;aid to be about 60, including officers.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Four hundred and one pri&s;oners, taken near Bennington by Gen. Stark, were e&s;corted to Bo&s;|ton; they con&s;i&s;ted of Briti&s;h, Brun&s;wick and Cana|dian troops.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Capt. Harden arrived at Bo&s;ton in a Con|necticut State &s;hip of 20 guns: he brought in with him a Jamaica packet, which he took during his cruize. It was &s;aid the packet had a large &s;um in &s;pecie on board; and a Mr. Shirley and family, on their pa&s;&s;age to England. The la&s;t accounts &s;tated both Gen. Wa&s;hington's and the northern army to be near the enemy; and important news might be momently expected.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="126">
19th.&mdash;Col. Lee's regiment moved into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;The di&s;agreeable news was received, that on the 11th in&s;t. a &s;evere action took place between Gen. Wa&s;hington's and Howe's armies, near the Brandywine, which ended rather in favour of the latter, who remained ma&s;ters of the field. The Brit|i&s;h here, as in &s;everal other in&s;tances, had recour&s;e to &s;tratagem: they held out the appearance of an intention of forcing their way at Chad's Ford, which Gen. Kniphau&s;en menaced with a heavy column of. He&s;&s;ians; while the Briti&s;h column, by a long cir|cuitous march, reached the forks of the river, and there &s;ecured a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age. Gen. Wa&s;hington was pretty early apprized of this movement, and imme|diately took mea&s;ures for &s;trengthening his right, by ordering &s;ome troops from his left. After the ac|tion had become pretty warm on the right, and the Briti&s;h had got the advantage, Kniphau&s;en pa&s;&s;ed Chad's Ford; and although the troops who were &s;till on the left behaved well, they were by no means &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the heavy column of He&s;&s;ians. It is &s;aid, that after the He&s;&s;ian Grenadiers had cro&s;&s;ed the Ford, they halted at the foot of the hill, below the Americans, under a warm fire, and with great deliberation changed their hats for their heavy bra&s;s caps, which were carried by a loop on a button at the hip, and then a&s;cended the hill, from which the Americans were obliged to retire. Here the brave Capt. Bryant, of the artillery, who had before &s;eve|ral times di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf under the eye of our General, received a mu&s;quet-ball in the bottom of his belly; a brother officer carried him off the field, but he died of the wound. Gen. Wa&s;hington, &s;ec|onded by his officers, did every thing in their power to check the Briti&s;h; and a part of the American army took a po&s;ition which probably &s;aved the army
<PB N="127" REF="127">
from a total defeat. Perhaps the American army were, more or le&s;s, more generally engaged in this action, than in any other during the war. The A|merican lo&s;s was con&s;iderable in killed and wounded, and a number of pieces of bra&s;s field artillery were lo&s;t. The Briti&s;h al&s;o &s;uffered pretty &s;everely in killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The next night, Gen. Gray made, with much &s;e|crecy, an attack on a body of Americans, under the command of Gen. Wayne: the bayonet was chiefly made u&s;e of, and it proved but too efficacious again&s;t the Americans, who &s;uffered con&s;iderable lo&s;s, in killed and wounded. Gen. Wa&s;hington retreated fir&s;t to Philadelphia, and then left the city. The Briti&s;h army a few days afterwards advanced to Ger|mantown, and on the 27th a detachment of their army took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington's orders for &s;ending for|ward Colonels Lee's, Henley's and Jack&s;on's regi|ments, were received by our General.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Several prizes were &s;ent in by a privateer brig belonging to Col. Sears.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on Friday, the 19th in&s;tant, there was a warm and bloody action between Gen. Gates's and Burgoyne's advanced troops, which la&s;ted until dark. The troops behaved with the greate&s;t bravery on both &s;ides. Col. Mor|gan's light corps, and eleven other American regi|ments were more or le&s;s engaged. Of the Ameri|cans, 2 Lieutenant Colonels, Coburn and Adams, 3 Captains, 3 Subalterns, and 56 non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates were killed, and 248 wounded. Thelo&s;s of the enemy was very con&s;iderable, and much greater than that of the Americans. On the 18th, the day preceding the foregoing battle, Col. Brown made an excur&s;ion in the enemy's rear to Lake

<P>27th.&mdash;Col. Craft's regiment of State artillery marched out of Bo&s;ton, with 4 light field-pieces and an eight-inch howitzer, towards Providence, on a &s;ecret expedition, as it was called.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that &s;everal val|uable prizes had been &s;ent into Dartmouth.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the 16th, Gen. Du Condray was drowned in the Schuylkill; he rode into the ferry-boat at one end, but was not able to command his hor&s;e, who went out at the other end of the boat, plunging into the river. This officer, as before mentioned, was en|gaged to come to America, to take the command of the artillery; but whatever may have been his tal|ents, the artillery was &s;o well commanded, that the placing a foreign officer over them, in &s;uch a man|ner, and who&s;e rank would al&s;o have &s;oared above many other officers in the line, would mo&s;t certain|ly have produced a convul&s;ion in the army. had it been per&s;i&s;ted in. This circum&s;tance prevented the danger. The &s;ame day, Col. Lee's regiment march|ed for the main army.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Col. H. Jack&s;on's regiment encamped on Bo&s;ton common, and the next day, about noon, marched out of town for the army; the regiment, although &s;mall, made a good appearance. About the &s;ame time that the regiment marched out of town, upwards of 100 Briti&s;h and Canadian pri&s;on|ers, taken near Lake George, by Col. Brown, march|ed in.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;It was learnt that a body of the enemy, &s;aid to be about 3,000, were moving from New-York
<PB N="129" REF="129">
towards Peek's Kill. Gen. Wa&s;hington, after he left Philadelphia, encamped near a place called Skippack Creek, about 16 miles from German|town.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;At 3 o'clock, A. M. an expre&s;s arrived from Gen. Gates's army, with an account that on Tue&s;day, the 7th in&s;t. a &s;mart action took place be|tween the right of Gen. Burgoyne's army, and the American left, when the enemy were repul&s;ed, drove back to their works, and then forced from them. Three Field-Officers, 6 Captains, 10 Subalterns, 1 Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General, and 190 privates were taken pri&s;oners, be&s;ides 300 taken in the ho&s;pital&mdash;8 pieces of bra&s;s cannon, 2 twelve and 6 &s;ix pounders, 3 am|munition-waggons, 300 tents, 200 barrels of flour, and a large quantity of baggage were trophies of victory. One hundred of the enemy lay dead on the ground. The American lo&s;s, although not ex|actly known, was &s;aid not to be more than 30 killed and 100 wounded; among the latter, Generals Ar|nold and Lincoln, both in the leg, the former but &s;lightly; it was problematical whether the latter was wounded by a Briti&s;h or American &s;oldier. Gen. Frazer, an enterpri&s;ing officer of the Briti&s;h, was mortally wounded, and died of his wounds.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a body of the Briti&s;h from New-York, in about 30 tran&s;ports, had proceeded up the Hud&s;on; they had made &s;ev|eral landings below and at Peek's Kill: on Monday the 6th in&s;t. they cro&s;&s;ed over, and landed on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, and marched along the hills towards Fort Montgomery and its dependencies: this fort was tolerably &s;ituated on the bank of the Hud&s;on, to annoy &s;hipping going up the river; and the works were pretty good on that &s;ide, but were not &s;o, nor fully completed on the back &s;ide; and the right flank was commanded by higher ground
<PB N="130" REF="130">
on the &s;outh, and near the fort, on the other &s;ide of Pooplop's Creek, the mouth of which was near to the &s;outh &s;ide of the fort; on this higher ground, and near to the &s;mall deep pond, a &s;trong redoubt, called Clinton, was erected; it was equally e&s;&s;ential that this redoubt &s;hould be taken, as a reduction of the fort: the Briti&s;h therefore moved again&s;t this redoubt, while another column, by a more circuit|ous movement, fell in the rear of Fort Montgom|ery; they were met in the defiles, where the &s;kir|mi&s;hes were &s;harp; but they continued to advance to the redoubt, which was nobly defended, and be|fore which they &s;u&s;tained very con&s;iderable lo&s;s, (a number of their &s;lain were afterwards drawn out of the pond, where they had been thrown for conceal|ment) but &s;oon carried it, and afterwards Fort Mont|gomery. The garri&s;on principally made their e&s;cape in the du&s;k of the evening; among them were Gov. Clinton, and his brother, who was a Brigadier-Gen|eral al&s;o: they made their e&s;cape in a very hazard|ous manner, and the latter was wounded. After the reduction of Fort Montgomery, the Americans evacuated Fort Con&s;titution, and the block-hou&s;e on Con&s;titution I&s;land, oppo&s;ite to We&s;t Point (the lat|ter was not yet fortified;) and the two new frigates, <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Montgomery,</HI> which lay in the river, were &s;et on fire by the Americans and burnt. The enemy afterwards proceeded up the river, and burnt E&s;opus; their object was if po&s;&s;ible to form a junc|tion with Burgoyne, or open a water communication to Albany; and &s;pies pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Two or three of the enemy's cruizers ap|peared in the bay, but a few leagues from the Light. While the Briti&s;h army lay encamped at German|town, Gen. Wa&s;hington re&s;olved to attack them. This was a brave de&s;ign; and the &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t on&s;et, at about 3 o'clock, A. M. of the 4th in&s;t. af|ter
<PB N="131" REF="131">
the Americans had marched all the night, was equal to the de&s;ign; for the Briti&s;h, where the at|tack was fir&s;t made, were almo&s;t in&s;tantly pu&s;hed from their ground, and were falling back panic &s;truck on their other troops. When Lieut. Col. Mu&s;grove had the pre&s;ence of mind to throw &s;everal companies into a &s;trong &s;tone hou&s;e. Hou&s;es at all times, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of &s;tone and brick, under a judicious conduct, admit of a good defence; and at this time probably proved the means of the Americans' lo&s;ing an advantage, which no one can tell how far it might have been pu&s;hed. When an enemy is routed, and panic &s;truck are flying before the a&s;&s;ailants, the be&s;t, if not the only way, is to follow them, if the ground will admit of it, clo&s;e at their heels, taking care not to fall into ambu&s;eades. Thus the panic of fear continues to multiply; but if the pur&s;uers &s;top, and e&s;pecially if tho&s;e who were flying hear a firing behind them, but not upon them, they conclude that their own troops in turn have gotten an advantage, or at lea&s;t are holding their pur&s;uers at bay. This immediately recovers them from their panic; they will next return to the charge, and will be more likely to make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance than before they were at fir&s;t routed; while their return to the charge will greatly damp tho&s;e who before con&s;idered them&s;elves almo&s;t in the gra&s;p of victory. Hence what took place at Germantown was no wonder. The foggine&s;s of the morning was unfortunate for the Americans; but the Briti&s;h taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tone hou&s;e, and defending it, was the mo&s;t unfortunate circum|&s;tance. The lo&s;s on both &s;ides was con&s;iderable; on the &s;ide of the Americans, Brig. Gen. Na&s;h, and on the &s;ide of the Briti&s;h, Brig. Gen. Agnew, were among the &s;lain: but although this attempt
<PB N="132" REF="132">
was not crowned with victory, it cau&s;ed the Briti&s;h to have a more reverential opinion of Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, whom they now found dare to attack their whole army, even in a cho&s;en po&s;ition of their own. Perhaps it was be&s;t that the action clo&s;ed as it did; had the Americans made their way far into the long &s;treet of that town, probably many other hou&s;es would have been occupied in the &s;ame way. The burying-yard, with a &s;trong wall, was lined with troops by the enemy; and the po&s;ition in which their army lay, was calculated for their wings clo&s;ing in to much advantage; at any rate, the battle mu&s;t have been very bloody, and &s;ituation and circum|&s;tances were in favour of the Briti&s;h. After the Briti&s;h were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia, they had much to do in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dela|ware, and remove the ob&s;tructions which had been formed in it. There were al&s;o &s;everal works to be reduced; among others, a fort on Mud-I&s;land, and a pretty &s;trong work at Red Bank.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Highly important and mo&s;t intere&s;ting in|telligence was received, that on the 17th in&s;t. Gen. Burgoyne and his whole army &s;urrendered, under Convention. They were to be marched to then eigh|bourhood of Bo&s;ton, and from thence &s;ent to En|gland. Upon the receipt of this news, the cannon on Fort Hill were di&s;charged, and joy was &s;eated on every brow.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;At 1 o'clock, P. M. the cannon on Fort Hill, and on the heights of Dorche&s;ter were di&s;|charged, and al&s;o on board the &s;hips in the harbour. In the evening, our General's quarters (the hou&s;e of the late Hon. Mr. Ru&s;&s;el) was beautifully illumi|nated. The following is the number of troops which &s;urrendered to Maj. Gen. Gates, and the &s;tate of Gen. Burgoyne's army after he left Canada:</P>

<P>The bra&s;s ordnance taken were as follows; 2 24-pounders; 4 12-pounders; 18 6-pounders; 4 3-pounders; 2 8-inch mortars; 5 howitzers; total, 35, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e taken at Bennington.</P>
<P>Thus were the Briti&s;h totally di&s;appointed in this quarter. The troops intended to form a junction on the Hud&s;on were as high up as Poughkeep&s;ie; and Gen. Burgoyne informed our General after he arrived at Bo&s;ton, that on the evening after he had propo&s;ed to Gen. Gates to &s;urrender, in ca&s;e he could obtain honourable terms, which were to be &s;ettled the next day, a &s;py came in to him from the troops down the river, &s;tating how far they had got up, and what &s;teps were next to be taken; on which he (Gen. Burgoyne) a&s;&s;embled his officers more gen|erally than u&s;ual in councils, and &s;tated to them the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation of both armies, and whether, con&s;i&s;tently with fair principles of honour, they could break off the negociation for an honour|able Convention, or not; when it was the unanimous opinion of every officer pre&s;ent that they could not.
<PB N="134" REF="134">
But in a &s;ituation like his, at that moment, danger at hand is more powerful on the mind, than the hope of relief at a di&s;tance. The troops who were up the river returned down.</P>
<P>The capture of Gen. Burgoyne and his whole ar|my, who were now on their way to Bo&s;ton, opened a new, important, and delicate field for our General. This army, in which there were many officers of military erudition, and &s;ome of refined and courtly manners, who had a high opinion of national hon|our and prowe&s;s, and who, in con&s;equence of the Convention which they had formed, had their &s;pirits by no means depre&s;&s;ed, as tho&s;e who are compelled to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion,&mdash;were &s;ure to lay a heavy ta&s;k on his &s;houlders. As &s;oon as he was notified that the&s;e troops were coming under his direction, he &s;et him&s;elf in earne&s;t to prepare for their recep|tion. The barracks at Pro&s;pect and Winter Hills were directed to be put in&s;tantly in order. The Council was applied to, to aid in the procurement of quarters from the citizens for the officers; nor was this an ea&s;y ta&s;k. The families of the citizens generally wanting the room in their re&s;pective hou&s;es, rendered it difficult to obtain &s;o many quar|ters as were nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o great a number, and extended the limits of the parole very con&s;iderably. The Council were di&s;po&s;ed to do every thing in their power, and gave orders accordingly whenever they were nece&s;&s;ary. A heavy duty was al&s;o falling on the Quarter-Ma&s;ter's department, as it re&s;pected quarters, and al&s;o fuel, the latter of which; had been rendered &s;carce in the vicinity, by the American ar|my having been here in 1775; and the enemy's cruizers prevented its being brought from the ea&s;tern country. But the exertions of Col. Cha&s;e, who was Deputy-Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tants
<PB N="135" REF="135">
and conductors in his department, and of Col. Davis, who was Deputy-Barrack-Ma&s;ter, and who, in the procurement of fuel, was indefatigable, a comforta|ble &s;upply was obtained. Before the arrival of the troops at Cambridge, our General had dige&s;ted and drafted a parole, and &s;everal articles for the govern|ment of the troops in quarters; the&s;e he had drawn in as an article in the parole; and the honour of the officers in this way, was pledged for their ob&s;ervance of the articles, which rendered the government of them much ea&s;ier; being thus bound to govern them&s;elves with propriety, or infringe their paroles; knowing that many things in minutiae, would be to &s;ettle, which would be tedious in an epi&s;tolary way. As &s;oon as General Burgoyne had arrived at Cam|bridge, our General &s;ent over one of his Aid de-camps to invite Gen. Burgoyne to dine with him the next day, bringing with him his two Major-Generals, Phillips and Reide&s;el. An elegant dinner was pre|pared, and many other gentlemen invited, among whom were Generals Glover of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Whipple of New-Hamp&s;hire, who were at the cap|ture, and had commanded the e&s;cort, &amp;c. from Sar|atoga to Cambridge.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 8th.&mdash;Our General &s;ent one of his Aids to accompany Gen. Burgoyne and the other officers into Bo&s;ton, by the way of Roxbury; they arrived &s;ome time before dinner, as was intended, that bu&s;i|ne&s;s might be con&s;idered. The parole was &s;hewn to them, and the articles for their government in quar|ters, with which they were well plea&s;ed. But here a di&s;covery was fir&s;t made of &s;omething which they wi&s;hed to retain, while in our country, and which our General would never for a moment allow. Gen. Phillips turning to our General, ob&s;erved, "Sir, you well know the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;oldiers, and that they
<PB N="136" REF="136">
will more or le&s;s in all armies commit &s;ome di&s;or|ders; &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould delegate to Gen. Burgoyne the power of &s;eeing <HI>your</HI> orders executed." Our General replied, that he knew the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;oldiers, and al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ity of order and di&s;ci|pline; that he was not only willing, but expected that Gen. Burgoyne, and every other officer, would exert them&s;elves to keep order; that for this purpo&s;e among them&s;elves, and for internal order and obe|dience, he might command and puni&s;h as might ap|pear to be nece&s;&s;ary; but in no ca&s;e to attempt cap|ital puni&s;hment. But as to the exerci&s;e of his own command, and enforcement of his own orders when nece&s;&s;ary, was a juri&s;diction which Gen. Burgoyne mu&s;t not expect to exerci&s;e while here. Gen. Bur|goyne &s;miled, and Gen. Phillips turned it off by &s;ay|ing, "I only meant it for your ea&s;ement, Sir."</P>
<P>Before dinner was done, &s;o great was the curio&s;ity of the citizens of both &s;exes, and of all ages and de|&s;criptions, to get a peep at Gen. Burgoyne, that the &s;treets were filled, the doors, windows, the tops of the hou&s;es and fences crowded. Gen. Burgoyne had a&s;ked our General if he would indulge him to go out of town by the way of Charle&s;town, which was in&s;tantly granted. When he was ready to de|part, our General told him that he &s;hould accompa|ny him to the ferry; and a proce&s;&s;ion was formed, the American gentlemen mixing with the Briti&s;h. The &s;treets were &s;o crowded, that it was difficult getting along; but not a word or a ge&s;ture that was di&s;re&s;pectful. When arrived oppo&s;ite to the Prov|ince-Hou&s;e, Gen. Burgoyne turned round to the other Generals, and ob&s;erved, "There is the former re&s;idence of the Governor;" when &s;ome per&s;on on the &s;ide of the &s;treet, and in a tone fully to be heard, added, <HI>"and on the other &s;ide is the riding-&s;chool;"</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="137">
alluding to the Old South Meeting-Hou&s;e, having been put to that u&s;e in 1775: but the General, who mu&s;t have heard it, made no reply, but &s;oon after ob&s;erved, "Sir, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the civility of your people; for were you walking the &s;treets of London in my &s;ituation, you would not e&s;cape in|&s;ult." When arrived at the ferry-ways, the crowd were down to the water's edge; but when the boat put off, there was not the lea&s;t indecency, or wry countenance di&s;covered.&mdash;O my dear country|men! how did this your dignified conduct at that moment charm my very &s;oul! Such conduct flows from a <HI>greatne&s;s of mind,</HI> that goes to conquer a world.</P>
<P>Col. Keith was appointed Deputy-Adjutant-Gen|eral, and Maj. Swa&s;ey Town-Major.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The Council were &s;till deliberating on the &s;ubject of quarters, and determined to do every thing in their power; but &s;ome individuals were refractory.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Gen. Hancock arrived in town, and was &s;aluted by the di&s;charge of the cannon of the Fort, Park, &amp;c.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Intelligence was received of the repul&s;e of the enemy, before the redoubt at Red Bank, on the 22d ult. This redoubt or fort had a garri&s;on by no means &s;ufficient properly to man the whole work. The commanding officer had therefore wi&s;ely le&s;&s;en|ed it, by running a parapet with a ditch acro&s;s the area of the fort, but had left the work entire in its large&s;t extent. A body of cho&s;en troops were &s;ent to reduce this work, under the command of the He&s;&s;ian Col. Donop, a brave and good officer. In order if po&s;&s;ible to get &s;ome idea of the work, he &s;ent his &s;ummons for the fort to &s;urrender by a very ca|pable Adjutant; but the Commandant of the fort took care to have him &s;topped without the work, and
<PB N="138" REF="138">
where he had no opportunity to &s;ee more than the ditch and parapet on that &s;ide. The commanding officer refu&s;ing to &s;urrender, an a&s;&s;ault was made; the a&s;&s;ailants at the head of the column bringing in their hands a &s;ufficient number of &s;hort fa&s;cines to fill the ditch where they meant to pa&s;s, which was well done, and the parapet was mounted; but to their di&s;appointment and &s;urpri&s;e, they now found there was another ditch and parapet to pa&s;s, and in the face of a dreadful fire too, which made great &s;laughter; a number of them, however, advanced into the &s;econd ditch, and began to remove the frizes on the berme; but the&s;e were generally killed in the ditch, and &s;uch as were not killed or wound|ed obliged to quit the outer work. Their lo&s;s in killed and wounded was great; among the latter, Col. Donop mortally; he was taken after the action near the fort, and brought in. An En&s;ign had made his way over the &s;econd ditch, had got on to the frizes, and lay clo&s;e again&s;t the ba&s;e of the para|pet until the action was over, and then got up and &s;urrendered, ob&s;erving that he thought his po&s;ition the only &s;afe one; for had he attempted to put his head above the parapet, he knew his brains would have been in&s;tantly blown out; or if he had attempted to re-cro&s;s the ditch, he &s;hould have been &s;hot in the back. Be&s;ides this &s;evere check, the Briti&s;h met with con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition and lo&s;s at other places, before they got full and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the river; particularly at Mud I&s;land. They lo&s;t the Au|gu&s;ta man-of-war, and &s;uffered other naval damage.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington being now con&s;iderably rein|forced with a part of the northern conquering army, advanced to White Mar&s;h, about 14 miles from Phil|adelphia, where he encamped, in a &s;trong and well cho&s;en po&s;ition. Gen. Howe, apprehen&s;ive that this
<PB N="139" REF="139">
movement indicated a de&s;ign upon Philadelphia, de|termined to move out, and either invite Gen. Wa&s;h|ington to a general action, or, if he found him vulner|able, to attack him in his own po&s;ition. Accordingly, on the evening of the 4th of December, he marched with the Briti&s;h army, and on the next morning took po&s;t on Che&s;nut Hill, in front of the American right. Gen. Wa&s;hington, knowing the goodne&s;s of his po&s;ition, wi&s;ely continued in it; nor dare Gen. Howe attack him. The latter then changed his ground to a new po&s;ition, oppo&s;ite to the American left and centre; but neither dare he attack either of the&s;e. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes took place, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es; in one of which Brig. Gen. Irwin on the American &s;ide was wounded. After &s;everal days &s;pent in this way, Howe was obliged to return, with|out effecting any thing, to the no &s;mall injury of his army, who had &s;uffered much from the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. Indeed nothing is more de&s;tructive to an army than winter campaigns. After this, Gen. Wa&s;hington moved the American army to Valley Forge, on the Schuylkill, about 16 miles from Phil|adelphia, where he took a po&s;ition as wi&s;ely cho&s;en as the other, and where the army erected huts for the winter.</P>
<P>We now return to take up our chain of events.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;A French &s;hip, with dry goods from France, by the way of St. Peters, arrived at Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Gen. Burgoyne had not yet &s;igned the parole; he pretended to delay until their quarters were fully furni&s;hed, although he had every a&s;&s;urance that it &s;hould be done as fa&s;t as circum&s;tances would po&s;|&s;ibly admit. On this day, therefore, our Gen. wrote him the following letter.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TWO weeks have now elap&s;ed &s;ince I had fully expected that the officers would have &s;igned their paroles. They have, during this time, been enjoying in a great mea&s;ure the liberty of the limits intended to be a&s;&s;igned to them, without pledging their hon|our by parole; which is not only contrary to the e&s;|tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of nations, but contrary to the eleventh article of the Convention. Whatever ob|jections might at fir&s;t be made to giving the parole, mu&s;t now be done away, by the fulle&s;t evidence that proper quarters &s;hall be provided, and which in a very con&s;iderable degree is already done. I mu&s;t, therefore, in the mo&s;t explicit terms, in&s;i&s;t that the officers who wi&s;h and expect to be permitted on pa|role, agreeably to the Convention, do &s;ign it to|morrow. This is &s;o rea&s;onable, that I expect there will be no further he&s;itancy; and I &s;till a&s;&s;ure your Excellency, that no endeavours of mine &s;hall be wanting to fulfil the Convention, and to treat the officers with politene&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR's of ye&s;terday is before me; and al|though you might at fir&s;t imagine that the Hon. Continental Congre&s;s have no right of interference in matters of the Convention, yet I conclude upon further reflection you mu&s;t be convinced, that as that body are the Repre&s;entatives of that people who are to reap the advantages or di&s;advantages of the Convention, and as all continental officers are acting by virtue of their authority, and under their direc|tion, they a&s;&s;uredly have a right of interference, and to give &s;uch orders to their officers as they may think proper, for the full completion of the Con|vention, and for the &s;afety and good of the people.</P>
<P>The paragraph of my orders of the 20th in&s;t. re&s;pecting the troops of the Convention is founded in rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, being de&s;igned only to a&s;cer|tain the officers and &s;oldiers who were comprehend|ed in the Convention, that in ca&s;e any of them (contrary to their faith and honour) &s;hould hereafter be found in arms again&s;t the&s;e States, in North-America, during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, they may be convicted of the offence, and &s;uffer the puni&s;hment in &s;uch ca&s;e inflicted by the law of nations. I mu&s;t therefore in&s;i&s;t that you furni&s;h me with proper li&s;ts of names, and de&s;criptions, for the purpo&s;e be|fore mentioned as &s;oon as may be.</P>

The other li&s;ts of the names and rank of the commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and number of non-commi&s;|&s;ioned officers and &s;oldiers, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;everal purpo&s;es of regularity with Quarter-Ma&s;|ters and Commi&s;&s;aries (and which &s;hould be fre|quently renewed, as circum&s;tances may vary) &s;hould long ere this have been exhibited.

<P>I &s;hall at all times endeavour to found my or|ders on the principles of honour, rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and not to infringe tho&s;e delicate principles in oth|ers; but my orders for the purpo&s;es of order and regularity, mu&s;t be obeyed by every man and all bodies of men placed under my direction; and fully determined I am, that offenders &s;hall not pa&s;s with impunity.</P>

<P>23d.&mdash;Gen. Burgoyne wrote an an&s;wer to the foregoing. But he now acknowledged a further ex|tent of the &s;upreme power, than in his former letter; but &s;till at lea&s;t obliquely denied the right of their interference with the Convention troops, who were under expre&s;s &s;tipulations until they quitted the country, and that no new conditions could be im|po&s;ed upon them; and a&s;&s;erting that no &s;uch requi|&s;itions were laid upon the American pri&s;oners in Canada; and concluding, that if it could be found that &s;uch had been required by the Briti&s;h in any ca&s;e, he would &s;ubmit to it. About this time, an officer, who had been a pri&s;oner in Canada, return|ed to Bo&s;ton on parole, and gave information that he and others had complied with &s;imilar injunctions
<PB N="144" REF="144">
before they came away; upon this being communi|cated to Gen. Burgoyne, he found that he had got to the end of his tether of eva&s;ion; he did not at|tempt to di&s;pute more, but ob&s;erved, that he &s;up|po&s;ed if it was done any time before the troops de|parted, it would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. Our General found that nothing could be done by force, for were he to attempt of him&s;elf to have the li&s;ts taken, ev|ery thing might be evaded except the &s;ize and com|plexion. He therefore laid the matter before Con|gre&s;s, with the copies of what had pa&s;&s;ed. Congre&s;s took the matter into con&s;ideration, and Pre&s;ident Laurens wrote our General an approbation of his conduct, and not to pu&s;h the matter, as Congre&s;s would take a more exten&s;ive view of the bu&s;ine&s;s; concluding his letter, <Q>I have in conclu&s;ion to a&s;|&s;ure you, Sir, that Congre&s;s repo&s;e the utmo&s;t confidence in your addre&s;s and abilities for con|ducting with propriety this important bu&s;ine&s;s, in which, on one &s;ide, the faith and honour of the&s;e infant States are to be pre&s;erved, and on the other, the magnanimity and re&s;olution of Congre&s;s to be exemplified.</Q></P>
<P><HI>December.&mdash;</HI>Congre&s;s had received &s;ome intima|tions, that an application would be made to them for leave for the troops of the Convention to em|bark at &s;ome other place than Bo&s;ton; they there|fore on the 1&s;t of December pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution, that no other place than that &s;tipulated in the Con|vention, viz. <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> &s;hould be admitted. A few days after, Gen. Burgoyne applied, as was &s;u&s;pected, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions that all the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries furni&s;hed to the troops of the Convention &s;hould be paid for in &s;pecie, or replaced in quantity and quality.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="145">
1778. <HI>January.&mdash;</HI>Gen. Burgoyne had now got him&s;elf into a very &s;erious entanglement; he had not only refu&s;ed, and then delayed to give de&s;crip|tive li&s;ts of the troops of the Convention, but &s;ome time before, viz. in the month of November, had written a letter to Gen. Gates, complaining that the troops had not been furni&s;hed with quarters as they had a right to expect, and among other things a paragraph as follows:</P>
<P><Q>While I &s;tate to you, Sir, this very unexpected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, I entirely acquit Maj. Gen. Heath and every gentleman of the military department of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> to the public faith engaged in the Con|vention. They do what they can; but while the Supreme Powers of the State are unable or unwil|ling to enforce their authority, and the inhabitants want the ho&s;pitality, or indeed the common civiliza|tion to a&s;&s;i&s;t us without it, the public faith is broke, and we are the immediate &s;ufferers.</Q></P>
<P>This was unrea&s;onable, as it re&s;pected both the civil power, and the people; for the former did every thing in their power, unle&s;s they had turned the citizens out of their hou&s;es to have let the Con|vention officers in, which was not to be expected; nor could it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the citizens would turn their familles them&s;elves into the &s;treets. But Congre&s;s con&s;idered the conduct of Gen. Burgoyne, and the&s;e and other of his expre&s;&s;ions on the occa|&s;ion, as calling for &s;erious con&s;ideration. They therefore inve&s;tigated the whole in all its latitudes; and the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s wrote our General that as it was a matter of high importance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">ired deep deliberation, it would probably occu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ome days, before the re&s;olutions would be com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ed.

Gen. Burgoyne had received intimations that a fleet of tran&s;ports were about to come round for the troops, and that the <HI>June</HI> frigate was to wear a flag for his particular accommodation. This he men|tioned to our General, and wi&s;hed to know if the frigate might come up into the harbour. Our General had no apprehen&s;ions of any danger from a frigate entering the harbour, but apprehended that &s;ome people might think that he was not &s;uffi|ciently vigilant, in ca&s;e he allowed it. He therefore told Gen. Burgoyne that the frigate could not come up into the harbour, and hinted to him the taking one of the mo&s;t convenient tran&s;ports in the fleet for the purpo&s;e; and he might do as he plea&s;ed when he got off. This touched Gen. Burgoyne exceedingly, who wrote a letter to our General, in which was the following paragraph.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>As to your allotment of a <HI>"convenient tran&s;port"</HI> for my pa&s;&s;age, if it was from your&s;elf, I am to thank you Sir, for a &s;ort of in&s;ult which the mo&s;t haughty man of office would be a&s;hamed of, in any other country. However, as I am determined every tran&s;action concerning this Convention &s;hall be no|torious, and beyond the powers of &s;ubterfuge to ex|plain away, I have directed the frigate together with the tran&s;ports to come round, and it will then be for you, Sir, to prohibit the entry of Bo&s;ton har|bour, to any &s;hips bearing a flag of truce, and de|claring they are &s;ent for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of con|veying to Great-Britain any part of the troops of the Convention.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Excellency's favour of ye&s;terday came duly to hand; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in it.</P>
<P>As by the Convention, tran&s;ports only are &s;tip|ulated to receive the troops, I &s;ubmit to you, Sir, whether a hint (if you were even &s;ure that it came from my&s;elf) that you &s;hould take a convenient one, rather than introduce a frigate, which is neither ex|pre&s;&s;ed or implied in the Convention, merits tho&s;e epithets which you are plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on me.</P>
<P>I have ever aimed to treat you with politene&s;s; and the plighted faith and honour of my country re|quire me to pay &s;trict attention to the Convention on their part: of cour&s;e, when tran&s;ports arrive to re|ceive the troops, they will enter the harbour; and if you can find by the Convention that a frigate is to enter for the particular reception of your&s;elf, &s;he will not be prohibited. But if it is rather uncom|mon for &s;hips of war, to bear flags of truce, and if con&s;enting to it in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;hould appear to be rather an act of politene&s;s and genero&s;ity than otherwi&s;e, I leave you to your own reflections whether you have made choice of the mo&s;t happy expre&s;&s;ions to obtain it.</P>

<P>Thus did the Admiral's opinion perfectly coincide with that of our General's.</P>
<P>But Congre&s;s had pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution, on the 8th day of January, upon principles clearly expre&s;&s;ed in a report of a committee, upon which the re&s;olution was founded.</P>
<P><Q>That the embarkation of Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, and the troops under his command, be &s;u&s;pended, till a di&s;tinct and explicit ratification of the Conven|tion of Saratoga &s;hall be properly notified by the Court of Great-Britain, to Congre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Our General's corre&s;pondence with Gen. Bur|goyne, re&s;pecting the frigate, &amp;c. was tran&s;mitted to Congre&s;s, and the Pre&s;ident &s;oon after wrote him&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>The Hou&s;e appeared to be plea&s;ed with your conduct in every re&s;pect relative to that officer.</Q></P>
<P> Gen. Burgoyne applied to Congre&s;s for leave to go to Europe him&s;elf: but Congre&s;s did not then
<PB N="149" REF="149">
think proper to grant his reque&s;t. Although this denial mu&s;t have been very painful to the General, he did not expre&s;s him&s;elf, or write any thing in the lea&s;t improper. He ob&s;erved to our General, that he was &s;orry; for that not only his health urged his departure, but that every day he was detained here, gave his enemies at home an opportunity for pierc|ing the wound of his reputation the deeper.</P>
<P>But Col. King&s;ton was not &s;o prudent as the General: a packet of letters which Gen. Burgoyne wi&s;hed to &s;end to Gen. Howe, was &s;ent to our Gen|eral for in&s;pection; among the&s;e was one from Col. King&s;ton to Lord Harcourt, in which, after ob&s;erv|ing that fortune had not &s;hewn them the &s;mooth &s;ide of her face, yet they thought their misfortunes honourable, proceeded, that he, (Gen. Burgoyne) was not well, but you know his firmne&s;s. But I think, "the in&s;incerity of France, bigotry of Spain, or the vindictive Portugue&s;e, &s;ituated as he is, would not have &s;ought for means unnece&s;&s;arily to detain him." This in&s;ult to the authority of the country induced our General to detain this letter, and he notified Gen. Burgoyne of it, adding, that while it was his wi&s;h to gratify the officers as much as po&s;&s;ible in writing to their friends, he expected they would be cautious and prudent in their manner of expre&s;|&s;ion. When the American Deputy-Adjutant-Gen|eral gave the letter from our General to Gen. Bur|goyne, and he had read it, he ob&s;erved, "I told Col. King&s;ton that Gen. Heath would not let that letter pa&s;s;" he &s;hould have done more&mdash;forbid his mak|ing the attempt.</P>
<P>Another &s;erious matter took place about this time: Col. Henley, who had the immediate com|mand at Cambridge, a brave and good officer, but warm and quick in his natural temper, having or|dered
<PB N="150" REF="150">
&s;ome pri&s;oners who were under guard turned out, that he might examine them, one of them treated him, as he judged, with much in&s;olence; upon which he pricked him with a &s;word, or bayo|net. Gen. Burgoyne immediately pre&s;ented a com|plaint again&s;t Col. Henley, charging him with bar|barous and wanton conduct, and intentional murder, as appears in the following letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, <DATE><HI>Jan. 9th,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A REPORT has been made to me of a di&s;tur|bance that happened at the barracks on Wedne&s;day afternoon, for which I am much concerned; and though the provocations from your people, which originally occa&s;ioned it, were of the mo&s;t atrocious nature, I was willing the offender on our part &s;hould be properly puni&s;hed. But Col. Henley, not content with that, made pri&s;oners of eighteen inno|cent men, and &s;ent them on board a guard-&s;hip, as alleged by your order. It is not only a duty to my &s;ituation to demand the immediate di&s;charge of the&s;e men, together with a &s;atisfactory apology; but I al&s;o mean it as an attention to you, Sir, that I give you an immediate opportunity to di&s;avow &s;o unju&s;tifiable a proceeding, as committing men to the wor&s;t of pri&s;ons upon vague report, caprice and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In&s;ults and provocations, at which the mo&s;t placid di&s;po&s;itions would revolt, are daily given to the officers and &s;oldiers of this army. Regular, decent complaints are received by your officers, &s;ometimes with haughtine&s;s, &s;ometimes with deri&s;ion, but al|ways without redre&s;s. The&s;e evils flow, Sir, from the general tenor of language and conduct held by Col. Henley, which encourages his inferiors, and &s;eems calculated to excite the mo&s;t bloody purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="151">
For want of &s;ufficient information, and not bringing my&s;elf to believe it po&s;&s;ible that facts as re|lated by common report could be true, I have hith|erto declined taking public notice of this man; but upon po&s;itive grounds, I now and hereby formerly accu&s;e Col. Henley of behaviour heinou&s;ly criminal as an officer, and unbecoming a man; of the mo&s;t indecent, violent, vindictive &s;everity again&s;t unarm|ed men; and of intentional murder.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR's, of ye&s;terday's date, I received the la&s;t evening. What provocations you allude to, as hav|ing been offered by my troops, I am at lo&s;s to deter|mine. The in&s;ults and abu&s;es which they have re|ceived, I will venture to &s;ay, unle&s;s I have been mo&s;t gro&s;sly mi&s;informed, are unparalleled; and whether you are willing or unwilling, Sir, offenders &s;hall no longer pa&s;s with impunity.</P>
<P>If it can be made to appear, that any of tho&s;e &s;oldiers &s;ent to the guard-&s;hip by my orders, are in|nocent, they &s;hall be relea&s;ed from their confine|ment but with re&s;pect to &s;uch as have been guilty of violating my &s;tanding orders of the garri&s;on, in|&s;tead of di&s;avowing or making any apology for the con&s;inement of &s;uch, be a&s;&s;ured that I do mo&s;t ex|plicitly
<PB N="152" REF="152">
avow it. And as I have before ob&s;erved to your Excellency in a former letter, of which you may be a&s;&s;ured, I &s;hall at all times endeavour to found my orders on the principles of honour, rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and not to infringe tho&s;e delicate prin|ciples in others: &s;o al&s;o be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that &s;uch my orders &s;hall be obeyed by every officer and &s;oldier placed under my direction; and &s;uch as have the hardine&s;s to tran&s;gre&s;s them, &s;hall abide the con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>I have been informed of late, that &s;ome have hinted, that &s;uch of your troops as break my orders, ought to be tried and puni&s;hed by your orders. Even the mention of &s;uch a thing, I conceive to be (to u&s;e your own words in a late letter, with a little variation) a &s;ort of in&s;ult, that a man of military erudition in any country would be a&s;hamed of, as being repugnant to every idea of military di&s;cipline; and from my opinion of your military knowledge, I cannot admit that you ever hinted it.</P>
<P>To convince you that it is my fixed determina|tion, to inquire into all abu&s;es, whether committed by my own troops, or tho&s;e of the Convention, whil&s;t they remain within my department, I have ordered Col. Henley under arre&s;t, and appointed a Court of Inquiry, whereof Brig. Gen. Glover is Pre&s;ident, to examine into the grounds of your complaint, on Wedne&s;day next, at 10 o'clock, A. M. at Cam|bridge; and if any complaints have heretofore pa&s;&s;ed unredre&s;&s;ed it is becau&s;e they have not been laid be|fore me. You hinted to me when I had the plea&s;|ure of &s;eeing you la&s;t at Cambridge, that one of my officers had been enticing &s;ome of the troops of the Convention to enter our &s;ervice. I then informed you, that if you would &s;end the complaint, I would immediately bring the officer to trial. You promi&s;ed
<PB N="153" REF="153">
to do it, but I have not yet received it. I now call upon you to exhibit that charge, or any other, that you have to make again&s;t any officer under my com|mand, for practices of that kind, or any other; being with your&s;elf fully determined that all my conduct re&s;pecting the Convention &s;hall be notorious, and beyond the powers of &s;ubterfuge to explain away. Complaints of mo&s;t enormous abu&s;es, have lately been made to me; one, of the conduct of a number of officers on the evening or night of the 25th of December, at Bradi&s;h's tavern; others, of pri&s;oners being re&s;cued from the guards&mdash;centinels abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted on their po&s;ts&mdash;pa&s;&s;es counter|feited, and others filled up in the mo&s;t affrontive manner; and of late, &s;everal highway robberies com|mitted in the environs of the garri&s;on&mdash;one the la&s;t evening, in which a gentleman was robbed of be|tween 7 and 800 dollars, and a watch. The rob|beries I do not charge to your people, as it is un|known who were the perpetrators; but there are &s;everal rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect it. All the&s;e, Sir, tend not only to exa&s;perate the troops, but to enrage the inhabitants of the country, who view &s;uch abu&s;es as un&s;ufferable.

<P>Gen. Burgoyne found fault, that a Court of In|quiry only was appointed, and not a Court-Martial. He was an&s;wered, that this was frequently the ca&s;e; that it did not preclude the latter; and where an officer of rank, and in particular one who had the immediate command was the object, this previous &s;tep was both ju&s;tifiable and proper. The Court of Inquiry met, and gave in their opinion; and in the general orders of January 18th, the following was announced:&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>The Court, whereof Brig. Gen. Glover was Pre&s;ident, appointed by the orders of the 10th in&s;t. to inquire into the grounds of a complaint exhibited by Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne again&s;t Col.

Henley, as well as for the &s;atis|faction of all concerned, that the judgment of a Court-Martial &s;hould be taken on his conduct, during his command at Cambridge.</P><P>The General, approving the opinion of the Court, orders that a &s;pecial general Court-Martial &s;it on Tue&s;day next, at 10 o'clock A.

<P>The Court met, and adjourned &s;everal times, through a long, particular, and tedious trial. Gen. Burgoyne attended, and in a very engaged and el|oquent manner &s;aid every thing which he judged proper; which, although novel in Courts-Martial, was yet permitted.</P>
<P>The general orders of the 27th of February an|nounced as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Col. David Henley, late commanding officer of the po&s;t at Cambridge, tried at the &s;pecial general Court-Martial, whereof Brig. Gen. Glover was Pre&s;ident, accu&s;ed by Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, of a general tenor of language and conduct, heinou&s;ly criminal as an officer, and unbecoming a man; of the mo&s;t indecent, violent, vindictive &s;everity again&s;t unarmed men, and of intentional murder.</P><P>The Court, after mature con&s;ideration, are of opinion, that the charge again&s;t Col. Henley is not &s;upported, and that he be di&s;charged from his arre&s;t.</P><P><PB N="156" REF="156">
The General approves the opinion of the Court; thanks them for their unwearied endeavours to in|ve&s;tigate the truth; and orders Col. Henley to re|a&s;&s;ume his command at Cambridge immediately.</P><P>The General thinks it to be his duty on this oc|ca&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that although the conduct of Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, (as pro&s;ecutor again&s;t Col. Henley) in the cour&s;e of the foregoing trial, in his &s;everal &s;peeches and pleas, may be warranted by &s;ome like precedents in Briti&s;h Courts-Martial, yet as it is altogether novel in the proceedings of any general Court-Martial in the army of the United States of America, who&s;e rules and articles of war direct, that the Judge-Advocate-General &s;hall pro&s;|ecute in the name of the United States; and as a different practice tends to render Courts-Martial both tedious and expen&s;ive&mdash;he does prote&s;t again&s;t this in&s;tance being drawn into precedent in future.</P></Q>

<P>18th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Gov. Cook, that three frigates and twenty-three &s;ail of tran&s;ports &s;ailed from Newport, on Sunday the 15th in&s;tant, &s;tanding to the north-ea&s;t. Our General received a letter from the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, in which he ob&s;erved, "I had the honour of receiving, by Mr. Clo&s;ki, the 5th in&s;tant, your favour of the 10th ult. including a late corre&s;pondence with Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne; the&s;e were immediately reported to Con|gre&s;s, and tran&s;mitted to the Board of War, from whence a report has not yet a&s;cended; therefore I have no particular commands relative to your &s;aid di&s;patch. I may, however, with propriety and plea&s;|ure intimate, that your conduct towards the Briti&s;h General and his dependents, receives the continued approbation of Congre&s;s, if I may be permitted to make this conclu&s;ion from the general &s;entiments of Members."</P>

23d.&mdash;Ju&s;t before noon, Gen. Lincoln arrived in Bo&s;ton from Albany; his leg was recovering fa&s;t, but he was &s;till very lame, and was conveyed from place to place on a moveable bed, with handles, which was fixed on the runners of his &s;leigh, with a canopy and curtains, and was convenient al&s;o to re|move into the hou&s;e, &amp;c. In this was blended in|genuity and convenience.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that the Briti&s;h tran&s;ports, de&s;tined to take away the troops of the Convention, had arrived at Holmes's Hole; and the next day, March 1&s;t, that they had arrived at Cape Harbour, Province-Town, Cape Cod. But Gen. Burgoyne was not now to depart.</P>

<P>Although I wi&s;h on every occa&s;ion to extend the utmo&s;t genero&s;ity to the gentlemen of the army, yet to allow letters to pa&s;s unopened, would be betraying the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me. Therefore any idea of granting &s;uch an indulgence cannot be admitted.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Many people having grown jealous that the troops of the Convention had collected and &s;ecreted arms in the barracks, they could not be quieted until the matter was a&s;certained; and on the 18th, our Gen|eral ordered a &s;trict &s;earch to be made, when noth|ing was found but the officer's fuzees, to which by the Convention they had a right. A <HI>wag,</HI> coming from the barracks, was a&s;ked if any thing was found; he an&s;wered, "Yes&mdash;in one of the rooms a large bra&s;s mortar." This &s;pread, and was alarming to be &s;ure. The fact was, that in one of the rooms there was a large bell-metal pe&s;tle and mortar, for family u&s;e. Jealou&s;y, like the other pa&s;&s;ions, although a virtue in it&s;elf, may exceed its bounds; and when it does, "trifles, light as air, to jealous minds are &s;trong as proofs of holy writ."</P>
<P>Capt. Dalrymple wrote to Gen. Burgoyne again, on the 15th, and propo&s;ed to put the &s;pare provi|&s;ions on board one of the flags, and &s;end them up to Bo&s;ton harbour.</P>
<P>But on the 23d, Capt. Brathwait of the Centurion, wrote the General that he had arrived at Cape Cod, with orders from Vi&s;count Howe for the men-of-war and tran&s;ports with the provi&s;ions on board them to return to Rhode-I&s;land, which they did accordingly.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;General Lincoln left Bo&s;ton for Hing|ham; our General accompanied him as far as Milton.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that a 40 gun &s;hip had arrived at New-London, laden with cloathing for the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160">
18th.&mdash;A detachment of Col. Henley's regiment marched out of Bo&s;ton for the army.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;General Burgoyne having again applied to Congre&s;s for leave to go to England him&s;elf, they now gave him liberty. This was joyous to the General, and he wrote our General that he had a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf that there would be nothing thrown in the way on his part, and wi&s;hed for his pa&s;&s;ports. The Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, in his letter to our Gen|eral, by the &s;ame expre&s;s, informed him that it was late in the evening when the re&s;olve, granting Gen. Burgoyne leave to depart, pa&s;&s;ed, and nothing was &s;aid re&s;pecting the &s;ettlement of the accounts before his departure; but that it was fully his opinion that the former re&s;olve &s;hould be &s;trictly ob&s;erved; for Congre&s;s had before re&s;olved, that neither he nor the troops of the Convention &s;hould depart, before the accounts were &s;ettled and paid. Our General, therefore, told General Burgoyne, that this mu&s;t fir&s;t be done, and that then he &s;hould meet with no delay: on this he he&s;itated, and then a&s;ked how the accounts were to be &s;ettled? He was an&s;wered&mdash;Strictly conformable to the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s. He then a&s;ked if Congre&s;s could be &s;erious in their re&s;olution, requiring in &s;pecie the &s;ame &s;um which they had expended in paper money? Our General replied that he &s;uppo&s;ed that honourable body were &s;erious in all their re&s;olutions. He then replied that this was unju&s;t, for the odds was double; and appealed to our General to &s;ay whether he thought it ju&s;t him&s;elf? Our General an&s;wered, that as an executive officer, it was not for him to judge or determine whether the orders of his &s;uperiors were ju&s;t or not. General Burgoyne replied, that was true. He was then told, that if he did not choo&s;e to pay for the &s;upplies, the act allowed him to replace them, in quality and quantity; and this
<PB N="161" REF="161">
&s;eemed to remove his objections. After further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion the two Generals pledged their faith and &s;acred honour to each other, in which they both had the fulle&s;t confidence, that General Burgoyne &s;hould proceed to Rhode-I&s;land, accompanied by &s;uch offi|cers as our General might think proper to &s;end, to whom General Burgoyne &s;hould pay in &s;pecie the amount of the &s;upplies furni&s;hed in the Quarter-Ma&s;ter's department; and that he &s;hould forward in ve&s;&s;els bearing flags, provi&s;ions of the different &s;pe|cies they had received, within a certain number of days &s;tipulated; that no advantage &s;hould be taken by delay occa&s;ioned by &s;tre&s;s of weather; that a box of gold, as a pledge for any deficiencies in the provi&s;ions, &s;hould be depo&s;ited with our General, the balance of which, after the full &s;ettlement of the accounts, to be paid to the &s;enior officer of the troops of the Convention.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2d.&mdash;General Burgoyne came into Bo&s;ton, and dined at head-quarters; and before he took leave of our General, ob&s;erved, "I know your &s;ituation, Sir, and the difficulty of obtaining many foreign nece&s;&s;aries, you may want or wi&s;h. If you will give me a memorandum, on my arrival in England, I will with great plea&s;ure forward them to you." Our General thanked him for his politene&s;s, but was careful not to mention any, choo&s;ing rather to &s;uffer with his fellow-countrymen the nece&s;&s;ities of the times, than to avail him&s;elf of &s;o exclu&s;ive a favour.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Between 11 and 12 o'clock General Bur|goyne left Cambridge for Rhode-I&s;land, accompanied by Colonel Pollard and Samuel Barrett, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The Raleigh frigate, it was learnt, had arrived at Port&s;mouth, (N. H.)</P>
<P>A part of the Convention troops were ordered to be removed to Rutland, in the county of Worce&s;ter, and temporary barracks were erected for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="162">
15th.&mdash;A divi&s;ion of the Convention troops march|ed for Rutland under e&s;cort of a detachment of militia, commanded by Major Read.

<P>18th.&mdash;Mr. Barrett returned from Rhode-I&s;land, accompanied by a Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ary, Major Mor|ri&s;on, who was &s;ent on by Gen. Pigot, to negociate a plan for the future &s;upply of the troops of the Convention.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;About 2 o'clock, P. M. a waggon arrived from Rhode-I&s;land with a large &s;um of money, re|ceived in di&s;charge of the accounts, and for the troops of the Convention.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, Mr. Dean arrived from France, with the highly important intelligence, that the Court of France had acknowledged the Independency of the United States of America, and a treaty of alliance was concluded.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Five &s;ail of victuallers arrived in the lower harbour from Rhode-I&s;land, with provi&s;ions, for a replace of tho&s;e &s;upplied the troops of the Conven|tion.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h hand-bill for quieting America, as it was called, was received at Bo&s;ton. It was forwarded from Connecticut, where it had been &s;ent by Governor Tryon.&mdash;Governor Trumbull had made a mo&s;t magnanimous reply.</P>

<P>5th.&mdash;The French frigate Nymphe, Capt. Senne|ville, arrived in Bo&s;ton harbour, and &s;ailed out again on the 16th.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Certain intelligence was received, that the French Amba&s;&s;ador left England about the 20th of the preceding March, and that the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;a|dor had returned to England.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h made an excur&s;ion to Tiver|ton and Little-Compton, and did &s;ome damage.</P>
<P>Our General concluded with Gen. Pigot a &s;y&s;tem for the future &s;upply of the troops of the Convention, by &s;ending provi&s;ions from Rhode-I&s;land. This mode tended to the increa&s;e of provi&s;ions in the States, and to the ea&s;ier &s;upply of our own troops.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon my receiving the di&s;|agreeable report, the la&s;t evening, that an officer of the Convention had been &s;hot by an American cen|tinel, and that the centinel was confined, I ordered him to be clo&s;ely kept &s;o, and the Coroner of the county of Middle&s;ex to be certified that a Jury of In|que&s;t might be &s;ummoned to &s;it on the body of the officer. Decency and the utmo&s;t attention, in any country, could not have done more. A few minutes after I had di&s;patched the officer with the foregoing orders, I received your letter, couched in &s;uch terms that I am at a lo&s;s what epithets to give it. Were it even certain that the &s;hooting of the officer was an act of the mo&s;t deliberate wilful murder, why &s;hould you charge the&s;e free independent States with a bloody di&s;po&s;ition and with rebellion, and this State in par|ticular as void of every principle of ju&s;tice?

I ever had and &s;till have a per&s;onal regard for you, and wi&s;h in every re&s;pect to treat you with the utmo&s;t genero&s;ity; yet that duty which I owe to the honour and dignity of the United States, will not allow me to pa&s;s unnoticed &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions as are contained in your letter; and I can|not put any other interpretation upon them, than that they are a violent infraction of your parole, mo&s;t &s;acredly given. I do conceive it to be my duty, and I do hereby re&s;trict you to the limits of your hou&s;e, gardens and yard, and to the direct road from your quarters to the quarters of the troops of the Conven|tion, on Pro&s;pect and Winter Hills; expecting from you a parole, for propriety of conduct within tho&s;e limits; which if you refu&s;e, I &s;hall be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of ordering you to narrower limits, until I can obtain the plea&s;ure of the Honorable the Con|gre&s;s, touching this matter, to whom I &s;hall tran&s;mit your letter, and crave their directions.</P>
<P>As to your demand of liberty for an officer to proceed to Sir Henry Clinton, with a <HI>"report of this murder,"</HI> as you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s your&s;elf, I have only to reply, that as &s;oon as the Coroner has taken an inqui&s;ition, in which all the evidence re&s;|pecting this unhappy affair will be contained, I &s;hall tran&s;mit a copy thereof to Congre&s;s; and I &s;hall have no objection to your &s;ending a copy al&s;o to Sir Henry Clinton, by way of the head-quarters of his Excellency General Wa&s;hington, (if his Excellency &s;hould approve of it) together with any ju&s;t and de|cent repre&s;entations which you may think nece&s;&s;ary to make on this occa&s;ion or any other, after I have examined &s;uch letters; but as to an officer's going to Sir Henry Clinton, it is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;&s;o you will plea&s;e to excu&s;e my refu&s;al of it.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, <DATE><HI>June 19th,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL not animadvert upon, or an&s;wer any part of your letter of ye&s;terday, except what relates to your meaning to re&s;trict me to my hou&s;e, garden and yards, and to the direct road from my quarters to the quarters of the troops of the Convention on Pro&s;pect and Winter Hills, and requiring my &s;igning a new parole for my propriety of conduct within tho&s;e limits.</P>
<P>When by the treaty of Convention of Saratoga the officers were to be admitted on parole, it was clearly intended that a liberal interpretation was to be given of that agreement; and, to u&s;e your own words, generous limits were to be granted. I will not deny that the limits have been &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="172">
I apprehend, Sir, that under no &s;en&s;e or expla|nation of the treaty, the officers were to be denied intercour&s;e with the &s;oldiers&mdash;indeed, there is an ar|ticle particularly on that point; and by re&s;tricting me to my quarters, allowing me only the pa&s;&s;age to the barracks by the direct road, you would certainly have re&s;tricted me as you have done &s;everal other of|ficers, from whom you have taken the benefit of their parole, allowing for the di&s;tinction of my rank, having obtained a quarter in&s;tead of a barrack: it &s;eemed therefore a very extraordinary propo&s;al made to me that I &s;hould &s;ign a parole under a re&s;triction which deprived me of any advantage ari&s;ing from my giving one, according to the article on that &s;ub|ject in the treaty of Convention of Saratoga; and on this con&s;ideration I refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>You have, Sir, made me a pri&s;oner in my quar|ters, under a guard, and I am perfectly at ea&s;e about it&mdash;&s;hall bear it, Sir, and any other violence of power which may happen to me, with more patience than you may &s;uppo&s;e. I am very regardle&s;s about in&s;ults or injuries done me per&s;onally&mdash;I feel only, and then &s;everely, when any are offered to the troops I command.</P>
<P>But, Sir, you attempt at much more than re|&s;tricting my per&s;on; for in a paper &s;ent me this day, being your in&s;tructions to Lieut. Col. Pollard, dated June 18, 1778, you direct him, after he has planted centinels around my quarters, that he is to "wait on the next &s;enior officer, and acquaint him of General Phillips being confined." I am to inform you, Sir, that, bearing the King's commi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf &s;enior officer of the troops of the Conven|tion; and every officer of them will obey my orders as far as their pre&s;ent &s;ituation will allow. You may confine my per&s;on, but cannot have power to take
<PB N="173" REF="173">
from me my military place, nor my connexion with the Convention troops&mdash;it is too extravagant an idea to &s;uppo&s;e you capable of: &s;o little can it be in the power of an individual to deprive me of the commi&s;&s;ion I hold, that were the&s;e Colonies really ac|knowledged Independent and Sovereign States, it would not be in the power of their government to deprive an officer of another nation of his military commi&s;&s;ion, how far &s;oever they might &s;tretch and extend their power over his per&s;on. But, Sir, I mu&s;t be allowed to declare, that until the Colonies are ac|knowledged by Great-Britain to be Independent Sovereign States, I cannot view them in any other light than that in which they are con&s;idered by Great-Britain.</P>
<P>As you will not allow me to &s;end an officer to Sir Henry Clinton, I mu&s;t reque&s;t to take advan|tage of your expre&s;s for &s;ending my report and rep|re&s;entations to him; and I will beg to know when I mu&s;t &s;end you my letters.</P>

<P>ANOTHER of your favours of ye&s;terday was handed to me this morning. You may be a&s;&s;ured that the rea&s;on of my re&s;tricting you to your quar|ters, the day before ye&s;terday, was per&s;onally no agreeable &s;ervice. Duty to the honour and dignity of my country, made it indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Apprehending that &s;o great a re&s;triction from your
<PB N="174" REF="174">
former limits as I pointed out, might be con&s;trued by you a di&s;&s;olution of your parole, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary and al&s;o rea&s;onable that you &s;hould give a new one. I wi&s;hed that you might retain your quar|ters, and at the &s;ame time have a free intercour&s;e with the troops who are quartered at a di&s;tance from you; this di&s;tance is &s;o con&s;iderable that a parole is nece&s;&s;ary. I acknowledge that by the Convention, you are to be admitted on parole, and this parole is for propriety of conduct under &s;uch admittance; but that parole being forfeited, by mi&s;conduct, cea&s;es to be, and confinement in proportion to the offence, no breach of the Convention, but fully ju&s;tifiable upon every principle of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It was never in my idea to take away your com|mi&s;&s;ion, or di&s;&s;olve your connexion with the troops of the Convention; but, while under confinement, your power of acting might with propriety be &s;u&s;|pended, &s;o far as re&s;pected the tran&s;acting of public bu&s;ine&s;s between my&s;elf and you; but per&s;onal regard has prevented my going that length, any further than to notify the next officer of your con|finement.</P>
<P>I do not in&s;i&s;t that you, as an officer in the Briti&s;h army, are obliged to view the Free, Inde|pendent and Sovereign States of America, in any other light than they are acknowledged by the gov|ernment who&s;e &s;ervice you are in. But, under your pre&s;ent &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, I do in&s;i&s;t that you &s;hall not openly in&s;ult the honour and dignity of the&s;e Sovereign States with impunity.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of ye&s;terday, came to hand the la&s;t evening; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, contained matter novel and &s;urpri&s;ing to me. What ideas of a co|partner&s;hip in command you have entertained, I cannot tell. From the beginning, I have found a di&s;|po&s;ition in the &s;enior officer of the Convention, to a&s;&s;ume the right and authority of trying and pun|i&s;hing offenders for breaches of my orders. This I ever have and ever &s;hall view in no other light than that of in&s;ult. As &s;uch, I repre&s;ented it to his Ex|cellency Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e and thorough knowledge of di&s;cipline, led him, in a letter to me of the 13th Jan. to yield the matter in the following words: "I do not mean to deny that you have a right to take ju&s;tice into your own hands." Indeed it is a &s;ubject, concerning which, having heretofore &s;aid and wrote very fully, I &s;hall not at this time dwell long upon. As to agreement or co|partner&s;hip in command, it is ab&s;urd. In military command there mu&s;t be one &s;upreme head; at pre&s;|ent, the Honorable Congre&s;s have honoured me with the command of this department, and I imagin|ed that no officer within its limits would dare di&s;|pute it.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="179">
My orders, as I have repeatedly heretofore de|clared, &s;hall ever be founded on the principles of honour, rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and not to infringe tho&s;e delicate principles in others; &s;o I again declare that &s;uch my orders &s;hall not be broken or di&s;puted, by any officer or &s;oldier, placed under my direction, with impunity. The matter of command is no hid|den my&s;tery; the u&s;age and cu&s;toms of nations are known. The celebrated Vattel, Puffendorff and Grotius, with who&s;e writings I dare &s;ay you are ac|quainted, elegantly explain how an army that &s;ub|mits to another, whether the conditions are more or le&s;s honorary to them&s;elves, are to conduct whil&s;t they remain within the limits of the victors' camp, or juri&s;diction of their country. But I &s;hall not &s;pend time to rea&s;on on a &s;ubject which would reflect di&s;|honour on my&s;elf to allow even to be di&s;puted. Therefore, to &s;um up all in few words&mdash;that, as I am determined to treat the troops of the Convention with &s;trict ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity, &s;o I am determined that all offenders again&s;t my &s;tanding orders of the garri&s;on &s;hall be brought to proper puni&s;hment; that I will not allow the &s;enior officer of tho&s;e troops to try or puni&s;h for any offence again&s;t my orders; and, that the truth may at all times be properly in|ve&s;tigated, I &s;hall, from time to time, when occa&s;ion re|quires, appoint Courts of Inquiry for that purpo&s;e; and &s;uch as pre&s;ume to di&s;pute or counteract them, I &s;hall duly notice.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE, this morning, written to you a letter upon public matters. I will now a&s;&s;ure you, that I am &s;orry that my earne&s;t de&s;ire of pre&s;erving a com|munication of intelligence, between you and I, does not meet your con&s;ent; and I will lament that you will attend to the &s;udden reports you receive, &s;o ful|ly, and act upon them, without that good-humoured attention to me, which I had hoped and have en|deavoured &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us. You and I are nearly of an age&mdash;I will not di&s;pute under&s;tand|ings with you; but I certainly am an older &s;oldier, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily know the cu&s;toms of armies. Allow me to a&s;&s;ure you, the manner with which things are taken up &s;ometimes deviates from military rule. It is a fixed cu&s;tom to go from the head, downwards; and, when an En&s;ign offends again&s;t order, the <HI>Gen|eral</HI> does not conde&s;cend to altercate with <HI>him,</HI> but &s;ends his orders, his de&s;ire, or his opinion, to the commanding officers; and, in your &s;ending me&s;&s;ages to young officers, it injures your own con&s;equence, and certainly hurts mine. Believe me, that I am &s;trict again&s;t any breach of orders, and will never &s;uffer it to pa&s;s uncen&s;ured. I allow, the two offi|cers have behaved ill, and I will puni&s;h them; but the getting the counter&s;ign was an effect of good humour and &s;implicity in an American &s;oldier. Let me once more reque&s;t of you, to recollect your own &s;ituation, and it will put mine in a clear view to you. Whenever you have reports again&s;t any of our troops, let me know them, and I will give in&s;tant attention to them: but you will, I am &s;ure, imme|diately
<PB N="181" REF="181">
feel, that &s;ending a threat to two officers, that you would &s;end them on board a pri&s;on-&s;hip, and never informing me wherefore, was not &s;trictly con|formable to good humour or good di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>I am, with a very hearty de&s;ire of pre&s;erving harmony and order, and with much per&s;onal regard,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HEAD-QUARTERS, BOSTON, <DATE><HI>May</HI> 19, 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING, in my other letter of this date, an|&s;wered your's of ye&s;terday, I now reply to your fa|vour of the &s;ame date, which you are plea&s;ed to &s;tile <HI>"private."</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that no per&s;on living wi&s;hes to act with good humour more than I do; or would take more pains to cultivate harmony and a good under&s;tanding. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, you mu&s;t not expect that I &s;hall allow my&s;elf, either by frowns or flatteries, to give up the dignity of command repo&s;ed in me.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, I am determined, to extend every act of genero&s;ity towards the officers of the Convention, which is compatible with the &s;afety and honour of my country. I &s;hall not take up matters &s;uddenly, or proceed ra&s;hly, unle&s;s circum&s;tances &s;hall render it unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary; and although you may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater &s;hare of under&s;tanding than I am, and an older &s;oldier,&mdash;yet I have endeavoured to acquire a knowledge of my duty, and the cu&s;toms of armies and nations. I am not con&s;cious of any deviations from tho&s;e rules or cu&s;toms in general adopted by them.</P>
<P>The General who commands is undoubtedly the fountain of power, and all orders &s;hould de&s;cend
<PB N="182" REF="182">
from him through the proper officers, until they are communicated to the lowe&s;t order of the army; and that commander who di&s;putes with, or threatens young officers, undoubtedly le&s;&s;ens his con&s;equence, and will &s;oon become contemptible in the eyes of an army. Nothing of this was in the late tran&s;actions, that I know of: having received a report of the con|duct of the two officers, I ordered them to be con|fined to their quarters, and appointed a Court of In|quiry to examine into the grounds of the complaint, that I might have a clear under&s;tanding of the affair, and order accordingly. In all ca&s;es where you or the troops of the Convention are immediately cor|cerned in the orders, I have always directed that you &s;hould be &s;erved with a copy. As to any threatnings being &s;ent to the two officers, of confining them on board a guard-&s;hip, I know nothing of it.</P>
<P>The main difficulty &s;eems to ari&s;e from your ap|prehen&s;ion, that you are to try and puni&s;h all offend|ers again&s;t my orders. Here, Sir, notwith&s;tanding your knowledge and age in &s;oldiery, you much mi&s;|take, and cannot &s;upport tho&s;e your preten&s;ions by any rule or authority, civil or military. The mo|ment you piled your arms, and marched off the ground, you became &s;ubject to the &s;tanding orders of the victor; and in every juri&s;diction through which you marched, or where you remain, are &s;ub|ject to all the orders and laws of the place; and &s;uch as violate them are obnoxious to puni&s;hment. The law and cu&s;tom of nations explicitly tell us, who are to try and puni&s;h: and, although I do not in the lea&s;t doubt your ready di&s;po&s;ition to inquire into, and even to puni&s;h offenders again&s;t my or|ders&mdash;yet when you attempt it, it is &s;uch an indig|nity offered to my authority, that you may be a&s;&s;ur|ed it ever will rai&s;e my re&s;entment; and if it did not, I am confident that your&s;elf (at lea&s;t hereafter) and
<PB N="183" REF="183">
all military men would de&s;pi&s;e me for my in&s;en&s;ibili|ty. In a word, Sir, cultivate tho&s;e principles of obedience to orders among the officers in your &s;it|uation, recommended and inculcated by the cu&s;tom and u&s;age of nations, and dictated by rea&s;on&mdash;and you may depend, that I &s;hall exert my&s;elf to make your &s;ituation as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible; and you may be al&s;o a&s;&s;ured, that I never &s;hall require that of the troops of the Convention, which, in the opinion of the ju&s;t and wi&s;e in any country, &s;hall reflect di&s;hon|our on them. With the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to cultivate and maintain harmony, and to treat you with re&s;|pect, and with much per&s;onal regard,</P>

<P>The &s;ame <HI>feelings</HI> which had great weight in the beginning of the war, continued for &s;ome time, namely, that Great-Britain was one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful nations in the world, in arts, and in arms; while the Americans were yet their Col|onies, young, weak, and but barely civilized, igno|rant of the world, and e&s;pecially &s;o of arts and of arms. Hence we &s;ee it &s;o frequently breaking out, (until experience had taught them a different opin|ion.) There was frequently, as in the atmo&s;phere, placid intervals; but whenever any cro&s;s wind hap|pened to blow, (and there is no &s;ea&s;on or circum|&s;tances without them) then in&s;tantly appeared tho&s;e ideas of &s;elf-&s;uperiority, and contempt for the Amer|icans, which was the true cau&s;e of many uncom|fortable hours. Mankind have the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions; the difference lies, in &s;ome riding with a double curb, while others give the reins.</P>
<P>This Convention bu&s;ine&s;s was a heavy ta&s;k for our General, and the whole &s;ubject would form an enter|taining
<PB N="184" REF="184">
volume of it&s;elf: we are now circum&s;cribed by our limits, and have only given a &s;mall &s;pecimen for mankind to form an opinion for them&s;elves. In all the letters or conver&s;ation which was had on the occa|&s;ion, we find &s;carcely a reflection ca&s;t by our General on the Briti&s;h nation, the cau&s;e in which they were engaged, or again&s;t any who were fortunate, or un|fortunate; but a uniform de&s;ire to make tho&s;e placed under his orders as comfortable as circum&s;tances would admit; at the &s;ame time, an un&s;haken deter|mination, a per&s;everant watchfulne&s;s, with decent language, to defend the cau&s;e and honour of his own country, by arguments &s;upported by the cu&s;toms and maxims of the civilized world.

</LETTER>
<P>29th.&mdash;A Spani&s;h xebeck and a French cutter arrived at Bo&s;ton, with di&s;patches from their re&s;pec|tive Courts, which were forwarded to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Certain intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h had left Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 9th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a warm action happened on the 28th ult. between Gen. Wa&s;hington's and Gen. Clinton's armies, near Mon|mouth court-hou&s;e, in the Jer&s;ies. Gen. Clinton, having taken the re&s;olution to move from Philadel|phia to New-York, through the Jer&s;ies, commenced his movements accordingly, encumbered with an im|men&s;e train of &s;tores and baggage, which occupied &s;ome miles in length; and the&s;e are the greate&s;t in|cumbrance to a General, on a march of danger from
<PB N="186" REF="186">
an attack of his opponent, to which he can be ex|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of this intention and movement of the Briti&s;h General, than he made his arrangements accordingly, cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and pu&s;hed detached corps forward to ob&s;truct the advance, gall the flanks, and fall on the rear of the enemy, while he moved on with the body of his army. By the 27th, Gen. Clinton had got on as far as Monmouth, and Gen. Wa&s;hington's detached troops were on his flanks, and clo&s;e on his rear. Here the Briti&s;h General took a wi&s;e re&s;olu|tion, to make a &s;tand with a part of his be&s;t troops, while he pu&s;hed on his baggage through the difficult defiles, under the careful and experienced hand of Gen. Kniphau&s;en.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington, acting with equal &s;kill, and equal bravery, made every arrangement which the moment called for. On the morning of the 28th, he ordered Maj. Gen. Lee to attack the enemy's rear, him&s;elf moving on bri&s;kly to &s;upport him; but to his &s;urpri&s;e, as he advanced on, he met Lee's troops retreating and the enemy impetuou&s;ly pur&s;u|ing. Here was Gen. Wa&s;hington &s;een in all his &s;plendor; for this critical &s;ituation is the orb in which he &s;hines the brighte&s;t. He rallied the re|treating troops: he in&s;pired them by precept and by example; and the misfortune of the morning was con&s;iderably retrieved.</P>
<P>The Americans fought bravely, and &s;o did the Briti&s;h. After hard fighting, in a mo&s;t inten&s;e hot day, when &s;cores died of the heat, and drinking too freely of cold water when they could find it, both ar|mies remained on the ground. The Americans de|termined to re-commence the action early on the next morning; but Gen. Clinton, finding that his baggage had &s;truggled pretty well through the de|files,
<PB N="187" REF="187">
and had got tolerably well advanced, took the advantage of the cool of the night to &s;lip off, unper|ceived by the Americans, and got to ground where he was &s;afe. Some &s;harp words took place between Gen. Wa&s;hington and Maj. Gen. Lee, as the one advanced and the other retreated, which i&s;&s;ued in the arre&s;t, trial and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the latter. Gen. Wa&s;hington reported to Congre&s;s, that the Amer|icans buried of the Briti&s;h 4 officers and 245 pri|vates; among the former, the Hon. Col. Monckton, (who was a brave and experienced officer) and that there were a few pri&s;oners. The American lo&s;s; killed, 1 Lieutenant-Colonel, 1 Major, 3 Captains, 2 Lieutenants, 1 Serjeant, 52 rank and file&mdash;wound|ed, 2 Colonels, 8 Captains, 4 Fir&s;t-Lieutenants, 2 Second-Lieutenants, 1 En&s;ign, 1 Adjutant, 8 Ser|jeants, 1 Drummer, 120 rank and file&mdash;mi&s;&s;ing, 5 Serjeants, 126 rank and file; of the artillery, one Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, 7 Matro&s;&s;es, and 1 Bombadier were killed&mdash;one Captain, 1 Serjeant, 1 Corporal, 1 Gun|ner, and 10 Matro&s;&s;es wounded&mdash;one Matro&s;s mi&s;|&s;ing&mdash;&s;ix hor&s;es killed, and two wounded. Both Generals undoubtedly have much credit for their conduct in this action. Gen. Clinton's object being to reach New-York with his baggage, &amp;c. obtained this victory, with the lo&s;s which he &s;u&s;tained. Gen. Wa&s;hington's conduct was well calculated for vic|tory on his &s;ide; and how far he would have &s;uc|ceeded, had it not been for the misfortune of the morning, none can tell. This misfortune began by expo&s;ing the American advanced troops, in line, on the &s;ide of the field where they were cannonaded by the Briti&s;h, who at the &s;ame time wi&s;ely expo&s;ed on|ly their artillery to that of the Americans. It is to be remembered, that men may be led on to action in the face of a cannonade, before which they will not <HI>&s;tand;</HI> the point of deci&s;ion is in the mind;
<PB N="188" REF="188">
while advancing, although galled by the fire of their opponents, the dead and wounded are left be|hind them as they fall, and the troops feel an ardour for arriving in a few minutes at a point, where they can u&s;e their own arms, to retaliate for the injury they &s;u&s;tain. But when men are placed open to the fire of the artillery of their enemy, at &s;uch a di&s;|tance as to prevent the u&s;e of their own arms in their defence, the dead and wounded fall and lie among them, or are drawn away, and every groan they make is heard. The troops &s;oon conceive that they are placed as marks to be &s;hot at; while the greater policy of the enemy keeps their column or line out of the rake of their cannon; the mind gives way, and retreat will be inevitable. This was experienc|ed in this in&s;tance, and the faire&s;t hopes of a noble on&s;et in a few minutes bla&s;ted; and the&s;e were &s;ome of the be&s;t troops in the army too. It was here that the firm Col. We&s;&s;on had his back peeled of its mu&s;cles, almo&s;t from &s;houlder to &s;houlder, by a can|non-ball. The confidence of the troops could not be fully recovered, until they &s;aw the pre&s;ence of their beloved General.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Count D'E&s;taing had arrived, with the fleet under his com|mand, off the Capes of Delaware. The fleet con|&s;i&s;ted of 12 &s;ail of the line, and 4 frigates. Off the coa&s;t of Virginia, they took a privateer, fitted out of New-York, of 26 guns&mdash;a &s;hip, bound from New Providence to London&mdash;re-captured a French &s;now laden with dry goods, and drove a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war on &s;hore.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that about 2,000 men, &s;aid to be invalids, had arrived at Rhode-I&s;land from New-York.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> refugees and Indians had de&s;troyed the town of Wy+oming,<PB N="189" REF="189">
 on the Su&s;quehannah, and butchered many of the inhabitants. The &s;ame day, it was learnt, that Gen. Wa&s;hington had cro&s;&s;ed Hud&s;on's River with the main army, except Gen. Wayne's brigade&mdash;that Count D'E&s;taing had appeared off Sandy Hook&mdash;that the inhabitants of New-York were in great con|&s;ternation, and that the Marquis de la Fayette, with Glover's and Varnum's brigades, were on their march for Providence.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h were very bu&s;y in fortifying Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>25th and 26th.&mdash;Sent for Providence 43,000 flints, five tons hard bread, a quantity of dry fi&s;h, &amp;c. and &s;ent a large number of the large flat-bottomed boats to Weymouth; they were to be conveyed, taking the advantage of the river, to the vicinity of Rhode-I&s;land. Half of Col. Craft's regiment of State artillery were ordered to Tiverton; the other half of the regiment of artillery, and a draft from the militia, to the number of 3000 men, including 1000 before ordered, were to march and reinforce Maj. Gen. Sullivan in the State of Rhode-I&s;land. On the 29th, at noon, the Count D'E&s;taing's &s;quadron came to anchor off Point Judith, and at evening &s;tretched a line from that Point to Secunnet.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;The regiment of State artillery, with 6 bra&s;s 4-pounders, and 2 bra&s;s howitzers, marched for Tiverton; and the next day the marine mortar was &s;ent on, &s;lung under two pair of &s;tout cart-wheels. The Briti&s;h &s;loop of war, Kingfi&s;her, a row-galley and a &s;loop, &s;tationed near Secunnet, upon the ap|proach of a French frigate, were run on &s;hore by their own crews, &s;et on fire, and left to burn and blow up. Maj. Bum&s;tead's company of Bo&s;ton ar|tillery, with two bra&s;s field-pieces, and Lieut. Dunnel, with a detachment of the Continental ar|tillery, with two field-pieces, marched for Rhode-
<PB N="190" REF="190">
I&s;land, and the militia and volunteers were on their march that way; and large quantities o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> military &s;tores and provi&s;ions were going from hence.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 10th.&mdash;Major-General Hancock, with his &s;uit, went for Rhode-I&s;land, to take the command of the militia. The &s;ame morning, Gen. Sullivan made a landing on the i&s;land, without oppo&s;ition. About the &s;ame time, the Count D'E&s;taing, with his &s;quadron, pa&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h batteries at Newport, when there was a bri&s;k cannonade on both &s;ides. Many of the &s;hot &s;truck in the town, and the inhab|itants were in much con&s;ternation, not knowing in what place they were &s;afe. A &s;hot entered the door of the hou&s;e of Mrs. Ma&s;on, a widow lady, a little above the floor: as the family were pa&s;&s;ing from room to room, not knowing where the next &s;hot might &s;trike, young Mr. Ma&s;on, pa&s;&s;ing through the entry, found the black man of the family &s;itting with his back again&s;t the &s;hot-hole in the door; on being a&s;ked why he &s;at there, he an&s;wered, "Ma&s;ter, you never know two &s;hot to go in the &s;ame place." Under this idea he was tranquil. Lord Howe's fleet appeared in the Offing, con&s;i&s;ting of 8 &s;ail of the line, and 12 frigates.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;The Count came to &s;ail, and &s;tood out, and the Briti&s;h fleet &s;tood off&mdash;the wind very fre&s;h.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;A mo&s;t &s;evere &s;torm of wind and rain, which &s;tripped many trees of their fruit, and tore others up by the roots, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The troops on Rhode-I&s;land, under the command of Gen. Sullivan, were on the 11th, 10, 122, includ|ing officers, exclu&s;ive of &s;ome volunteers from New-Hamp&s;hire, and other corps, arranged as follows:</P>

<P>15th.&mdash;The army advanced, and in the afternoon arrived within two miles of the enemy, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. Gen. Wa&s;hington with the main army, was at the White Plains, in the State of New-York, &s;aid to be about 20,000 &s;trong. Seventeen tran&s;ports with troops from Gen.

<P>On the evening of the 16th, Gen. Sullivan took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome high grounds which commanded the enemy's works on their right, and was not di&s;|covered until morning, when they began to cannon|ade the Americans, but did them no damage, which was continued the next day without injury.</P>
<P>On the night of the 17th, the covered way was nearly completed, and al&s;o two batteries of cannon. The enemy fired 300 or 400 &s;hot, but did no other damage than &s;lightly wounding two men.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The American works were advanced near|er to the enemy, and on the 20th, they had one man killed and two wounded by the enemy's cannon. In the afternoon the Count D'E&s;taing returned to New|port&mdash;his own &s;hip, the Languedoc, was totally di&s;|ma&s;ted in the &s;torm, and lo&s;t her rudder. In this
<PB N="192" REF="192">
&s;ituation, an Engli&s;h 50 gun &s;hip of Lord Howe's &s;quadron, came acro&s;s her, and got under her &s;tern, where &s;he did the Languedoc &s;ome &s;mall damage; but on wearing the Languedoc, &s;o as to bring &s;ome of her heavy metal to bear, the Engli&s;hman bore away. The Mar&s;eilles, a 74, lo&s;t her forema&s;t in the &s;torm, and the Ce&s;ar, a 74, parted from the &s;quadron.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;In the afternoon, the Ce&s;ar came to anchor in the light-hou&s;e channel, (Bo&s;ton lower harbour.) After parting from the &s;quadron in the &s;torm, &s;he fell in with a Briti&s;h 50 gun &s;hip, with whom &s;he was engaged for near three gla&s;&s;es, and would have taken her, had not &s;ome other Engli&s;h &s;hips hove in fight. The Ce&s;ar had 160 men killed and wounded, about 60 of which were of the former; and the Captain among the latter, who lo&s;t an arm. On his being brought up to Bo&s;ton, our General imme|diately paid him a vi&s;it, and expre&s;&s;ed to him his re|gret for the arm he had lo&s;t; to which the Captain replied, although very weak through the great lo&s;s of blood he had &s;u&s;tained&mdash;that he was ready to lo&s;e his other arm in the cau&s;e of the Americans. Remember this, ye Americans, in future times!</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the enemy threw 2 or 300 &s;hells at our troops on Rhode-I&s;land; two men only were wounded, and the fire bri&s;kly returned. The Count D'E&s;taing determined to come round with his &s;quad|ron to Bo&s;ton, and Gen. Sullivan mu&s;t retreat to the north end of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Hancock returned to Bo&s;ton. The volunteers were coming home.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 28th, the Count D'E&s;taing, with his &s;quadron, arrived in Nanta&s;ket Road, and the next day the Count came up to town.</P>
<P>On the 29th, there was a &s;mart action between the Briti&s;h and Americans, towards the north end of
<PB N="193" REF="193">
Rhode-I&s;land, which terminated in favour of the latter. The mo&s;t &s;evere part of this action was at the hollow between Butt's-Hill and Quaker-Hill, a ground &s;ituated for &s;laughter on both &s;ides, rather than for deci&s;ive victory on either. Col. Jack&s;on's regiment of continental troops, and Gen. Lovell's brigade of militia, are &s;aid to have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves; and the artillery drove off two frigates that attempted to cover the enemy's flank. The Americans had about 60 men killed, and 180 wounded. The lo&s;s of the enemy unknown.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 30th, Gen. Sullivan left the i&s;land; and on the morning of the 31&s;t, an ex|pre&s;s from Plymouth brought intelligence that 20 &s;ail of top&s;ail ve&s;&s;els were &s;een off that place the evening before&mdash;&s;ome of them very large &s;hips. In con&s;equence of this intelligence, our General, the Pre&s;ident of the Council, Gen. Hancock, and others, went down the harbour, to confer with the Count D'E&s;taing.</P>
<P>The next day, <HI>September</HI> 1&s;t, the Count came up to town, with a number of his officers, and was to dine with our General. Ju&s;t as the company were going to &s;it down, the &s;ignal guns announced the appearance of the fleet, and which were vi&s;ible from the town, (Mr. John Cutler having di&s;covered them from the &s;teeple of the Old South meeting-hou&s;e) appearing to be about 20 &s;ail, eight of which at lea&s;t were two deckers. The Count immediately put off for the &s;quadron. Several of the i&s;lands next to the road had been fortified, and the &s;quadron moored, in order to give a warm reception to the Briti&s;h, &s;hould they attempt to enter the road. A number of regiments of the militia of the vicinity, were or|dered to march immediately to the Ca&s;tle, Dorche&s;|ter Heights, Bo&s;ton, Noddle's I&s;land, &amp;c. Several &s;ignal guns were heard in the bay the latter part of
<PB N="194" REF="194">
the night, and the next morning the fleet was out of &s;ight. The militia which were coming in were coun|termanded. Admiral Byron's &s;quadron arrived a few days before, at Sandy Hook. The enemy made a de&s;cent on New-Bedford, and did con&s;iderable damage: they al&s;o made a demand on the inhabit|ants of Martha's Vineyard, for a large number of cattle, &s;heep, &amp;c.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;An affray happened in Bo&s;ton between &s;ome American and French &s;ailors; two French officers in attempting to part them, were much wounded&mdash;one of them, a Major of the fleet, died of the wounds on the 15th.</P>
<P>Brigadier-General Speckt, the elde&s;t Brigadier of the He&s;&s;ian troops under the Convention, wrote a letter to our General, in which he informed him, that, being advanced in age, he had but little ta&s;te for tho&s;e plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements which plea&s;e the young and gay; but he had not lo&s;t his ta&s;te for &s;porting with his gun, and reque&s;ted that he might do it within the limits of his parole. Nothing could be more plea&s;ing to our General, than to gratify this brave veteran &s;oldier; he therefore wrote him the following an&s;wer.</P>

<P>17th.&mdash;The General A&s;&s;embly ordered 1,200 men to be detached from the militia, and marched to Bo&s;ton immediately; and on the 19th, ordered one-third part of their train-band to be immediately detached for the purpo&s;e of completing the works in and about the town of Bo&s;ton&mdash;garri&s;oning the works, &amp;c. Our General went on board the Count's &s;hip, and with him to view the works on George's I&s;land.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The Count D'E&s;taing, with the officers of his &s;quadron, made a public appearance in town&mdash;were received by a Committee of both Hou&s;es of the General A&s;&s;embly, at their landing&mdash;break&s;a&s;ted at Gen. Hancock's&mdash;took punch and wine at Head-Quarters, at twelve o'clock; and then returned to the fleet, under a &s;alute on leaving the town, and on pa&s;&s;ing the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The grand army under Gen. Wa&s;hington took a new po&s;ition; one divi&s;ion under the immediate command of Gen. Putnam, at Fi&s;hkill; one under Gen. de Calb, at Frederick&s;burg; and one under Gen. Gates, at Danbury.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The General A&s;&s;embly countermanded their orders for calling out one third part of their train-band, and ordered that they be held in readi|ne&s;s to march on the &s;horte&s;t notice, wherever occa|&s;ion &s;hall require.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;The General A&s;&s;embly made a public dinner for the Count D'E&s;taing, &amp;c. &amp;c. The next day, the Count D'E&s;taing, Marquis de la Fayette, and a number of other officers and gentlemen, dined with our General.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="196">
<HI>October</HI> 5th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h de&s;troyed the &s;alt-works and &s;everal &s;tores, and did other damage, at Egg. Harbour; they al&s;o &s;urpri&s;ed a part of Pola&s;ki's le|gion in that neighbourhood, whom they handled very &s;everely. The Briti&s;h pretended that they had heard that Pola&s;ki had in&s;tructed his men not to give them quarter; they therefore anticipated retaliation. About the &s;ame time, Baylor's dragoons were &s;ur|pri&s;ed at Tappan, and treated much in the &s;ame man|ner. Nocturnal enterpri&s;es, in which the bayonet is principally made u&s;e of, are generally uncommon|ly bloody.</P>
<P>The Languedoc, the Count's &s;hip, having been completely repaired, fell down to Nanta&s;ket Road, and joined the &s;quadron.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Gen. du Portail, the Chief Engineer of the American army, came to Bo&s;ton to &s;urvey the &s;ev|eral works, in order to their being repaired or aug|mented, as might appear nece&s;&s;ary; and fatigue par|ties were employed on the different works, and eve|ry thing put in the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Our General, in company with the Count D'E&s;taing and others, went to Nanta&s;ket, to take a view of the works there, and to review a battalion of marines, who manoeuvred well, and in every partic|ular were well di&s;ciplined, owing to the unwearied attention of their Major, M'Donald, a Scotchman, who&s;e father was in the rebellion in England, and with this &s;on fled to France for &s;afety. Gen. Bou|ganville had the command at Nanta&s;ket; he was al|&s;o commander of one of the fir&s;t &s;hips in the fleet under the Count D'E&s;taing. The enemy left the Jer&s;ies, and prepared to embark a large body of troops. About 100 &s;ail of &s;hipping, including men-of-war, fell down to the Hook on the 17th of Octo|ber. On the 19th and 20th, the fleet &s;ailed from Sandy Hook; the fir&s;t divi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of upwards
<PB N="197" REF="197">

The &s;econd divi&s;ion, about 30 &s;ail, of which 2 were of 50 guns, and 2 frigates. They &s;tood to the ea&s;tward; there was but few troops on board the latter. Six brigades of the Continental army were on their march for Hartford, in Connecticut, to be ready to move this way, &s;hould the enemy appear in this quarter; and Maj. Gen. Gates was ordered to take the command in the Ea&s;t|ern Department.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 4th.&mdash;In the morning the Count D'E&s;|taing's &s;quadron &s;ailed from Nanta&s;ket Road.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Gates, with his lady, &s;uite, &amp;c. arrived at Bo&s;ton. The Somer&s;et, Briti&s;h man-of-war, of 64 guns, run a-&s;hore on Cape Cod, and was taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the militia, who &s;ent the crew pri&s;oners to Bo&s;ton.</P>

<P>10th and 11th.&mdash;The Convention troops marched for Virginia. They were marched to Connecticut, and delivered to the orders of Gov. Trumbull; and were in like manner to be conveyed from State to State, each furni&s;hing an e&s;cort, waggons, &amp;c. un|til they reached Virginia. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton, having refu&s;ed to give pa&s;&s;ports to American ve&s;&s;els to bring to Bo&s;ton provi&s;ions for the u&s;e of the Convention troops, or otherwi&s;e &s;upplying of them, Congre&s;s on the 15th of October, pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olve that the troops of the Convention &s;hould be removed to Charlotteville in Virginia, and they were now moving accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="199">
24th.&mdash;It was learnt, that the brigades which marched from the American grand army to Hart|ford, marched back to Danbury. In this month, Col. Alden, of one of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiments, with his clerk, were &s;urpri&s;ed and killed by the tories and Indians, at Cherry Valley, in the State of New-York. The regiment defended the place, and repul|&s;ed the enemy. The American army went into winter quarters in the Jer&s;ies, at Danbury, Peek's Kill, &amp;c. Capt. Hallet, on the 23d, on George's Bank, latitude 41 40 north, in 18 fathoms water, di&s;covered a ma&s;t 10 or 12 feet above water; upon a clo&s;e examina|tion, &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the top-ma&s;t of a 74 gun &s;hip of Admiral Byron's &s;quadron, which foundered in the &s;torm, when the Somer&s;et ran on &s;hore.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 19th.&mdash;It was learnt that the &s;mall armed ve&s;&s;els of the enemy did con&s;iderable damage to the inhabitants along the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, by plundering, taking their coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els, &amp;c. A little before this time, Colonel Jo&s;eph Ward, Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter-General, and Lieut. Col. Bradford, were taken by a gang of refugees, in the Jer&s;ies, and car|ried to New-York.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Our General received letters from Admi|ral Gambice, re&s;pecting the pri&s;oners taken from the Somer&s;et man-of-war, and propo&s;ing an immediate exchange; the letters couched in very polite terms.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;A waggoner, his hor&s;e and four oxen were found frozen to death near the dyke, on Bo&s;ton neck; they peri&s;hed in the &s;evere cold &s;torm on the preced|ing Saturday evening.</P>

<P>8th.&mdash;Capt. Mowatt, with his &s;teet of picaroons, were &s;till infe&s;ting the ea&s;tern harbours; they had already captured about 60 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els, inward and outward bound, and burnt &s;everal hou&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s had pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution for calling in the whole emi&s;&s;ion of Continental bills of May 20th, 1777, and April 11th, 1778, for which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were to receive loan certificates, or new emi&s;&s;ion bills.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;It was learnt, that the enemy had made an irruption into the State of Georgia, and were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sunbury. Their force, at fir&s;t about 500, was &s;aid to have increa&s;ed to upwards of 1000.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h &s;hip which foundered on George's Bank, and who&s;e ma&s;ts were di&s;covered by Capt. Hallett, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Cornwall, of 74 guns. It is &s;aid her whole crew were lo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 3d.&mdash;It was learnt, that the Count D'E&s;|taing, on his arrival in the We&s;t-Indies, made an attack on the Briti&s;h in the i&s;land of St. Lucia, but was defeated with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, after which he returned to Martinico.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;It was learnt, that a number of Americans, confined in Go&s;port pri&s;on, in England, among whom was Doctor Downer of Roxbury, made their e&s;cape in the preceding Sept. by &s;apping with great addre&s;s
<PB N="201" REF="201">
from the pri&s;on under the yard and fence, to the di&s;tance of 20 feet, daily concealing the earth which they dug, in the chimney of the pri&s;on. This Doctor Downer is the per&s;on mentioned to have killed a Briti&s;h &s;oldier in &s;ingle combat, on the 19th of April, in the battle of Lexington.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h troops had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Savannah in Georgia. Their light-infantry having &s;tole a march upon the Americans, by a pa&s;s through a &s;wamp, which was &s;uppo&s;ed impa&s;&s;able, and thereby defeated our army, under the command of General Robert Howe. The American lo&s;s was &s;aid to be about 30 officers, and near 400 men, killed, wounded and taken pri&s;oners. This event threw the whole State of Georgia into the hands of the Briti&s;h. The American General was accu&s;ed of mi&s;conduct, and a long time after brought to trial, and honourably acquitted. The Briti&s;h here practi&s;ed art, and force was obliged to yield to it. Their light infantry find|ing their way through the path in the &s;wamp, bring|ing of them on the flank and in the rear of the Americans, where they were not expected, or not guarded again&s;t, proved their overthrow. A few &s;hots on the flank or rear of an enemy, &s;erves to di&s;concert them more than a heavy fire in the front. The point of deci&s;ion here lies not in the force, but in the mind. A company of 50 men cannot fire more &s;hots in the &s;ame given time on the flank, or in the rear, than they could in the front; but the&s;e few &s;hots will have more effect on the minds of the enemy, than the fire of a whole regiment in their front. The Americans were va&s;tly inferior in num|bers to the Briti&s;h, and mu&s;t at any rate have been forced from the ground; but the Briti&s;h light-infantry pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;wamp, was the fir&s;t misfor|tune.</P>

They landed at the point a little before day-break, and in &s;uch &s;uperior force as obliged the General to aban|don the town, which he effected without lo&s;s.

Matters did not wear a favourable a&s;pect in that quarter; but it was hoped that Gen. Lincoln, who had now got the command, would give a new complexion to things at the &s;outh|ward.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2d.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Gates left Bo&s;ton for Prov|idence; in con&s;equence of which, the command again devolved on our General.</P>

<P>16th.&mdash;The Continental frigates, Warren, Ranger, and Queen of France, had been very &s;ucce&s;sful in a cruize, having taken &s;even or eight prizes going from New-York to Georgia: they were now com|ing in; among them the Ja&s;on, of 20 guns and 150 men; and Maria, of 16 guns&mdash;four field and about twenty commi&s;&s;ioned officers, were on board. A large number of accountrements for dragoons, dry

<P>A great unea&s;ine&s;s prevailed in the army at Prov|idence, on account of the &s;carcity of flour. Relief was &s;ent on.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 3d.&mdash;Capt. Farnald, of New-Hamp&s;hire, was unfortunately &s;hot in the brea&s;t, as he was &s;tanding on Hancock's wharf, by a mu&s;ket-ball di&s;charged from the Warren frigate.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that Col. Van|&s;caak, of the New-York line, with about 500 men, had lately made an excur&s;ion to Onondago, &s;urpri|&s;ed the ca&s;tle, killed 12 Indians, and took 34 pri&s;on|ers; de&s;troyed their ca&s;tle, cattle, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. without the lo&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Several ve&s;&s;els laden with rice, on account of the United States, arrived at Bo&s;ton, from the &s;outhward, which was a great relief to the troops.</P>
<P>An embarkation of troops had &s;ailed from New-York, under the command of Gen. Matthews, con|voyed by the &s;hips under the command of Sir George Collier. They entered the Capes of Virginia, on the 8th. The 9th or 10th they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fort at the entrance of Elizabeth River, on the we&s;t &s;ide. They de&s;troyed a number of ve&s;&s;els, &s;tores, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. and returned.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Sir Henry Clinton moved up the Hud&s;on, with a large body of troops, covered by Sir George Collier's naval force, which had ju&s;t returned from Virginia. The intention of Sir Henry Clinton was to &s;eize the po&s;ts at King's Ferry.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Gen. Vaughan, with the troops under his command, landed on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, a few miles below Verplanks; and Gen. Sir Henry Clin|ton on the we&s;t &s;ide, a little below Stoney-Point. They &s;oon got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both the points, and im|mediately rendered them more defen&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="205">
<HI>June</HI> 4th.&mdash;Our General received orders from Gen. Wa&s;hington to join the main army. He had before ordered all the heavy cannon at Bo&s;ton and Providence, belonging to the United States, to be &s;ent on to Hud&s;on's River; they were &s;ent on, &s;lung under two pair of &s;tout cart-wheels each, and were a ponderous load.</P>
<P>Our General received polite and affectionate ad|dre&s;&s;es, on his leaving the department, from the officers of the line&mdash;&s;taff department&mdash;the officers of the Bo&s;ton regiment of militia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 11th, he left Bo&s;ton, accompanied by a large and re&s;pectable number of officers and citi|zens, in carriages and on hor&s;e-back, as far as Water|town, where the gentlemen had ordered an elegant dinner to be provided. After having dined, he took his leave, amid&s;t a &s;hout of hearty wi&s;hes for his health and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;He reached Springfield&mdash;was met &s;ome di&s;tance out of town, by Col. Armand's dragoons, and the officers of the Springfield department; and, on entering the town, was received by the infantry of the legion, and a &s;alute of cannon from the park. Here he quitted the extent of his late ea&s;tern com|mand. He was e&s;corted out of town by the officers of the &s;everal military departments, and Armand's dragoons.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;He arrived at New-Wind&s;or; and on the 22d, attended Gen. Wa&s;hington to We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Our General took the command of the troops on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, having in front all the out-po&s;ts towards New-York, on that &s;ide of the river. The Briti&s;h were now in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of both the points at King's Ferry; and a num|ber of tran&s;ports had lain in the river for &s;ome time. The advanced po&s;ts of the Americans at this time, on this &s;ide, did not extend lower than Peek's Kill;
<PB N="206" REF="206">
and a picket mounted every night at the &s;outh foot of Sugar-Loaf Hill.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 24th, about 200 of the enemy's light-hor&s;e came up as far as Crom-Pond&mdash;&s;urpri&s;ed two militia pickets&mdash;killed and took pri&s;|oners about 30 men. About 130 light-infantry of the enemy, at the &s;ame time, came out from Ver|plank's Point, made an excur&s;ion round, and then returned.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 25th, the enemy's light-hor&s;e, and about 1000 infantry, were at Pine's Bridge. Our General ordered 200 light-infantry, under the command of Lieut. Col. Gro&s;venor, to march to Robin&s;on's &s;tores, near Marpoach-Pond, to cover that quarter.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;A de&s;erter came in from Verplank's Point, who reported that the Briti&s;h army, except five or &s;ix regiments, were to leave the Points, and were then embarking. Soon after, upwards of 30 &s;ail of tran&s;ports were &s;een, &s;tanding down the river. The Briti&s;h had a &s;loop at anchor off Peek's Kill landing, and a &s;hip off the Dunderberg. Le&s;t the enemy meant a deception, the Americans were ordered to lie on their arms, and a regiment extra was ordered to advance on the heights.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Three de&s;erters, one a He&s;&s;ian mu&s;ician with his horn, came in from the enemy; they con|firmed the te&s;timony of the former de&s;erter, that the body of the Briti&s;h army had left the Points.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Moylan's hor&s;e cro&s;&s;ed the river, to rein|force the left; they were to be followed by Armand's legion. At evening a de&s;erter came in from the en|emy. A detachment from the Briti&s;h at Rhode-I&s;l|and arrived at New-York.</P>

<P>Although this appointment was, in its nature, ve|ry honourable, with a &s;alary proportionate, (4,000 dollars per annum) and our General was informed that he would al&s;o retain his rank in the army, he ab&s;olutely declined an acceptance of it; expre&s;&s;ing, in a letter to his Excellency the Pre&s;ident, the high &s;en&s;e he entertained of the honour done him by the appointment; yet, that he cho&s;e rather to partici|pate in the more active operations of the field.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Gen. Huntington's brigade moved down, and took po&s;t at the gorge of the mountains, near the Continental Village. A de&s;erter came in from the enemy.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Col. Rufus Putnam reconnoitred the ene|my's po&s;itions at Verplank's and Stoney Points. At evening a de&s;erter came in from the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="208">
About 360 of the enemy's light-hor&s;e, and light-infantry, came out from Mile-Square, and attacked Col. Sheldon's light-hor&s;e, who were po&s;ted at Poundridge, about 90 in number. The &s;uperior force of the enemy obliged our hor&s;e, at fir&s;t, to re|treat; but, being reinforced by the militia, they, in turn, pur&s;ued the enemy. Our lo&s;s was one Corpo|ral, one Trumpeter, and eight privates, wounded: three Serjeants, one Corporal, and four privates mi&s;|&s;ing; and 12 hor&s;es mi&s;&s;ing. The &s;tandard of the regiment being left in the hou&s;e when the dragoons &s;uddenly turned out, was lo&s;t. Of the enemy, one was killed, four taken pri&s;oners, four hor&s;es taken, and one hor&s;e killed. The enemy &s;et fire to and burnt the meeting-hou&s;e and Maj. Lockwood's hou&s;e; they al&s;o burnt Mr. Hay's hou&s;e, at Bedford.</P>
<P>The 5th was an exce&s;&s;ive hot day, with a thunder &s;hower; the lightning &s;truck in the encampment of Col. Putnam's regiment, on Con&s;titution I&s;land, by which one man was killed; &s;everal received much hurt, and a large number were &s;tunned.</P>
<P>The enemy entered the Sound&mdash;landed, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New-Haven&mdash;plundered and in&s;ulted the inhabitants, and left the place.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;The enemy landed at Fairfield, and burnt many hou&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;About 6 o'clock, P. M. our General re|ceived orders from Gen. Wa&s;hington, to march, with the two Connecticut brigades, by the way of Crom Pond, towards Bedford. The next morning, although rainy, the fir&s;t brigade marched to the Village.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;The &s;torm cea&s;ing, the tents (although as wet as water could make them) were &s;truck, and the troops took up their line of march, reaching Amiwalk about &s;un-&s;etting. A report having been &s;pread in the fore part of the day, that the enemy
<PB N="209" REF="209">
were at or near Pine's Bridge, our General ordered the baggage-waggons, under proper e&s;cort, to file off to the left, and pur&s;ue a road running parallel with the one on which the column was moving, thereby keeping the column between the enemy and the waggons. Both arrived on the ground of encamp|ment within a few minutes of each other. The troops lay on their arms, without pitching their tents. The enemy continued their depredations at the Sound, and burnt &s;ome hou&s;es at Norwalk.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;At 5 o'clock, A. M. the troops took up their line of march, and reached Ridgefield, where they halted for the night. The next morning, our General &s;ent off all the tents and other baggage to Danbury, and took up his line of march towards Stamford. When he a&s;cended the high grounds in &s;ight of the Sound, the enemy's fleet was ob&s;erved under &s;ail, &s;tanding off and on between Stamford and Long-I&s;land. About 12 o'clock, two de&s;erters from Gen. Clinton's army came to our troops; they had left the Briti&s;h army two or three hours before, at which time the enemy were on the point of mak|ing a movement; the corps of guides and pioneers being then a&s;&s;embled at Gen. Clinton's quarters. This called for the exerci&s;e of di&s;cretion. The troops on board the tran&s;ports, with Gen. Tryon, if the whole &s;hould land, were far inferior to the force with our General; but the main Briti&s;h army, with General Clinton, was by far &s;uperior to his. If the whole of the Americans had marched down to Stamford, Clinton, by five or &s;ix hours forced marching, might have cro&s;&s;ed his rear, and have cut him off from a communication with the Highlands; he therefore re&s;olved to march forward to the Cro&s;s Roads, one of which went directly to the Briti&s;h ar|my, another to Stamford, and in his rear to the Highlands. Here he took a po&s;ition in order of
<PB N="210" REF="210">
battle, and detached Col. Starr's and Meig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">'s r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">|ments, with one field-piece, to Stamford, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">|proach towards the town, in open view, would pre|vent Tryon from landing; or, in ca&s;e he did with &s;uperior force, the detachment might be &s;urrounded In this &s;ituation the troops remained until du&s;k, and then took a more advantageous po&s;ition for the night, the whole lying on their arms, in order of battle. Early on the morning of the 15th, our General re|ceived information that the &s;hipping had gone down towards New-York; he therefore moved and took a &s;trong po&s;ition, between Ridgefield and Bedford, &s;ending out patroles of hor&s;e and foot, on all the roads. This movement towards the Sound, quieted the minds of the people, and &s;aved Stamford and other towns from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>While the attention of both the grand armies, and of the adjacent country, was turned towards the Sound, the Great WASHINGTON ordered General Wayne to &s;trike at Stoney Point, with the light-in|fantry, which lay not far di&s;tant from that po&s;t. This was done with great promptitude, the works being carried by a&s;&s;ault, and the whole garri&s;on made pri&s;oners of war, with all the artillery, ammuni|tion, &s;tores, &amp;c. This was a mo&s;t brilliant affair.</P>
<P>In advancing to the a&s;&s;ault, the front of the Amer|ican column led, with unloaded arms, relying &s;olely on the u&s;e of the bayonet. As they approached the works, a &s;oldier in&s;i&s;ted on loading his piece&mdash;all was now a profound &s;ilence&mdash;the officer, command|ing the platoon, ordered him to keep on; the &s;oldier ob&s;erved that he did not under&s;tand attacking with his piece unloaded; he was ordered not to &s;top, at his peril; he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, and the officer in&s;tantly di&s;patched him. A circum&s;tance like this, &s;hocks the feelings; but it mu&s;t be con&s;idered how fatal the con&s;equence would have been, if one &s;ingle gun
<PB N="211" REF="211">
had been fired; &s;cores would have lo&s;t their lives, and mo&s;t probably defeat have been con&s;equent; and therefore this was the le&s;&s;er evil.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 16th, &s;ignal guns were heard in the Sound, towards New-York, at intervals, from two o'clock until day-light. Gen. Clinton's army moved to Mile-Square.</P>
<P>Stoney Point having been taken, with &s;o much eclat to the American arms, Gen. Wa&s;hington de|termined an attempt on Verplank's Point, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on and oppo&s;ite to Stoney Point: for this purpo&s;e Maj. Gen. Howe, with two brigades and &s;ome 12-pounders on travelling carriages, was ordered to proceed by the way of Peek's Kill, throw a bridge over the creek, move on to the point, and open batteries again&s;t the enemy's works, while a cannonade and bombardment was kept up acro&s;s the river from Stoney Point.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;At about 10 o'clock, A. M. our General, while out reconnoitring, received, by an expre&s;s from Gen. Wa&s;hington, orders to move as expedi|tiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible to Peek's Kill, where he would find Gen. Howe with two brigades. Our General was to take the command of the whole, and carry into effect the orders which had been given to Gen. Howe. Our General returned immediately to the troops, and at 12 o'clock began his march towards Peek's Kill&mdash;marched until du&s;k 15 miles, when the troops halted and laid down to re&s;t on the &s;ide of the road; the dragoons not un&s;addling their hor&s;|es. At 3 o'clock the next morning, the troops re|&s;umed their march, and in the afternoon our Gen|eral received information from Gen. Howe, by ex|pre&s;s, that Gen. Clinton was on full march with his whole army towards Verplank's Point: an an&s;wer was returned, at what point the troops then were, and that they were marching as fa&s;t as the men could
<PB N="212" REF="212">
endure, and would continue &s;o until they reached him. When the troops had advanced a little to the we&s;tward of Drake's farm, Col. Movian came up from Gen. Howe, with information that a part of Clinton's army were then above the New Bridge on Croten river, pu&s;hing for the point; and that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> retreating from the point as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. On this, our General ordered Gen. Huntington, with his brigade and two field-pieces, to pu&s;h forward as fa&s;t as the troops could march and keep in breath, and take a po&s;ition on the high ground, to the &s;outh of Peek's Kill, which commands the road to the point, and al&s;o that to the New Bridge, on Croten river; and ordered a regiment to file off to the right, and &s;ecure the pa&s;s over the hills between Drake's and Peek's Kill, and al&s;o ordered the flank-guard on the left to be reinforced, and to &s;end out &s;mall flank|guards &s;till further from its flank. The troops mov|ing on with the utmo&s;t expedition to the ground which Gen. Huntington had been ordered forward to &s;ecure. Every moment that pa&s;&s;ed, was expect|ed to announce the commencement of an action be|tween the advanced or flanking parties of the two armies, but it did not take place. At this moment, Gen. Wa&s;hington, having learnt how matters &s;tood, and that po&s;&s;ibly Gen. Clinton might attempt to pu&s;h into the Highlands, &s;ent an expre&s;s to our Gen|eral, to move into the Highlands immediately, which was done ju&s;t after dark, the troops pa&s;&s;ing the night on Bald Hill. It was generally the opin|ion, that if our General had not been at hand to ad|vance in the manner he did, that Gen. Clinton, by a forced march of his light troops, backed by his ar|my, would have got in the rear of Gen. Howe, be|fore he could have po&s;&s;ibly gained the road at Peek's Kill, and between his army and a &s;ally from the garri&s;on of Verplank's Point inevitably cut off the

<P>On the morning of the 20th, the Briti&s;h army moved from their encampment, near the New Bridge, to Dobb's Ferry. The &s;hipping in Tappan Bay came to &s;ail, and &s;tood down the river. By a new di&s;po|&s;ition of the American army, on this day, our Gen|eral was to command the left wing; it then con&s;i&s;t|ed of two regiments of hor&s;e, and two divi&s;ions of infantry.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from Verplank's Point; they reported that the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about 1000 men. This day about 40 &s;ail of tran&s;|ports &s;ailed up the Sound. The Briti&s;h army en|camped near Dobb's Ferry, their advanced picket at Jonathan Odle's, three miles below Tarrytown; from this encampment the enemy moved to Mile-Square, Volentine's Hill, &amp;c. A de&s;erter from Ver|plank's Point reported that the Briti&s;h had again taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Stoney Point, and were repairing the works, their force on both &s;ides of the river being about 1500; and that they had got up the guns of our galley, which had been blown up.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h having &s;ent Col. M'Lean, in the month of the preceding June, with &s;ix or &s;even hundred men, to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t at the mouth of Penob&s;cot river, the Legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts determined to di&s;lodge them, and made arrange|ments for the purpo&s;e. The armament, with the
<PB N="214" REF="214">
troops, made their appearance on this day before the po&s;ts; the i&s;&s;ue is detailed in a &s;ub&s;equent page.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Four de&s;erters came in from the enemy; they reported that Stoney Point was repairing with great expedition, and that Lord Cornwallis arrived at New-York on the 24th.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Four de&s;erters came in from the enemy. Capt. Hopkins, of the dragoons, took the Captain of the Bellona tran&s;port, a Serjeant and Corporal of the 64th Briti&s;h regiment, and two &s;eamen, who had ventured too far on the &s;hore near <HI>Sing-Sing.</HI></P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from the enemy.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from Verplank's Point. This morning, Capt. Hopkins, of Moylan's light dragoons, fell in with a party of the enemy, under Col. Emmerick, near Young's tavern, and charged them vigorou&s;ly; but the Colonel being &s;upported by the He&s;&s;ian Yaugers, Capt. Hopkins was obliged to retreat: he brought off with him three pri&s;oners and four hor&s;es, and killed &s;ix of the enemy on the &s;pot, and wounded a number. Sev|eral pri&s;oners which he had taken, were retaken by the enemy. Capt. Hopkins had one dragoon and two hor&s;es wounded. The Briti&s;h army were under marching orders for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from the enemy. A body of the enemy landed in the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Capt. Hopkins gave notice that the Briti&s;h army had moved below King&s;bridge. Three de&s;erters came in from the enemy.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Six de&s;erters came in from the enemy. The Briti&s;h army encamped on York I&s;land: Em|merick's and Bearmore's corps above King&s;bridge. The American army remained at their re&s;pective po&s;ts in the Highlands.</P>

Three de&s;erters from Verplank's Point; they reported, that the garri&s;on, except 400 men, were to remove to New-York.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Four de&s;erters from the point.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters from the enemy. There were &s;ome de&s;ertions from our army to the enemy.</P>

<P>19th.&mdash;23 waggon loads of forage were brought off from the vicinity of Peek's Kill, covered by 250 men, under the command of Lt. Col. Putnam. The galley and one of the enemy's gun-boats fired a number of cannon-&s;hot at the party, but did them no harm. The night before, Maj. Lee, with about 400 men, &s;urpri&s;ed and took the garri&s;on at Paulus Hook.</P>

<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in. At night, the en|emy's guard-boats came as far up the river as An|tony's No&s;e, and fired &s;everal &s;hot at the camp of our light-infantry.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from the enemy. The enemy burnt two hou&s;es, belonging to the <HI>Lents,</HI> near Verplank's Point. Accounts were received,
<PB N="216" REF="216">
that Gen. Sullivan had advanced into the Indian country, and taken two of their principal villages.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Admiral Arbuthnot arrived at New-York, with about 200 &s;ail of tran&s;ports: between 2 and 3,000 troops arrived in the fleets, and a large &s;um of money was brought for the army. The continental frigates were very &s;ucce&s;sful at &s;ea, and &s;ent into Bo&s;ton &s;everal rich &s;ugar &s;hips.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from Verplank's Point; and a pri&s;oner belonging to the 33d regiment, taken by one of our patrolling parties, was &s;ent up. About 15 &s;ail of &s;quare-rigged ve&s;&s;els, lay at anchor near King's Ferry. 1231 recruits, of the 2,000, ordered by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to &s;erve 9 months, had already joined the army.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 4th.&mdash;Three de&s;erters from the enemy.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in. Preparations were making in New-York, for an embarkation of troops. The Briti&s;h army &s;ickly, e&s;pecially the newly arriv|ed reinforcement.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;The enemy made an excur&s;ion from King&s;|bridge, towards Hor&s;eneck; on their return, they carried off &s;ome cattle, &s;heep, poultry, &amp;c. Ac|counts were received, that General Sullivan had ob|tained further advantages in the Indian country.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from the enemy. Putrid fever and &s;curvy raged at New-York, among the Briti&s;h troops. The American army remained in their former po&s;ition: the Virginia line, near Ramapaugh, on the right; the light-infantry, near Fort Montgomery; the Maryland line, on the left of the light-infantry; Penn&s;ylvania line, and two brigades of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, at We&s;t-Point; North-Carolina brigade, at Con&s;titution I&s;land; the Con|necticut line, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, between Nel&s;on's and Robin&s;on's; Nixon's brigade, at the gorge of the mountains, above the Continental Vil|lage;

Glover's brigade, Moylan's, Sheldon's, and Armand's hor&s;e, at Lower Salem. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, be&s;ides Fort Clinton, at We&s;t-Point, and Fort Putnam, on the height back of it, there were &s;even or eight redoubts, built and building. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, the north and middle redoubts, and a redoubt at the gorge of the moun|tains. Great expectations of the arrival of a French fleet on the American coa&s;t.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Four de&s;erters came in from the enemy.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Ju&s;t after revelle, our General received orders to put Nixon's brigade under marching or|ders, which was done immediately. Gen. Howe was ordered to move with Glover's to Pine's Bridge, Croten River, and Nixon's to join him.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;A de&s;erter came in from Verplank's Point. The day before, a party of the enemy's hor&s;e came out from King&s;bridge, with intent to &s;urpri&s;e Lieut. Col. White; but, by the de&s;ertion of one of the par|ty, they were di&s;appointed. The Count de la Lu|zerne, the new French Mini&s;ter, arrived, and dined at Gen. Wa&s;hington's.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Nixon's brigade marched to form a junc|tion with Glover's, and a picket of 150 men mount|ed at the Village. Four de&s;erters came in from the enemy. The Count Luzerne was highly plea&s;ed with the treatment he received in pa&s;&s;ing through the New-England States. The 17th, he left head-quarters, on his way to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Gen. Howe was ordered to march back to Lower Salem, with Glover's and Nixon's brigades.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from the enemy. Some appearances indicated an evacuation of Ver|plank's Point.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;A de&s;erter came in from King&s;bridge. Preparations for the embarkation of a large body of troops continued at New-York.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="218">
29th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters from the enemy, and one the day before.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;The engineers, covered by a detachment of 300 men, reconnoitred the enemy's works at Ver|plank's; the enemy appeared to be much alarmed, and fired a number of cannon and &s;mall-arms at our party, and a reinforcement came over from Soney Point. At evening another de&s;erter came in.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;The American light-infantry moved down near to Kakeat, and the North-Carolina brig|ade from Con&s;titution I&s;land to New-Wind&s;or. One de&s;erter from the enemy.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from the enemy. Certain intelligence was received, that the Count D'E&s;taing had arrived at Georgia. The enemy, at Verplank's Point, opened a number of <HI>pits,</HI> about five feet deep, and four feet over, with a &s;harp &s;take in the middle, around the out&s;ide of the abbatis. By the la&s;t accounts from Gen. Sullivan, he was at Tioga, on his return this way; he had de&s;troyed a great number of Indian towns, and immen&s;e quan|tities of corn and other produce, and cut down many fruit-trees. It is a great pity the latter were not &s;pared; they would have been very plea&s;ing to the American &s;ettlers, who will one day, not far di&s;tant, fill that fertile country.</P>
<P>A number of armed ve&s;&s;els, from the Connecti|cut ports on the Sound, cut and brought off a num|ber of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els from Huntington harbour, Long-I&s;land, and the Halifax brig was taken by an armed galley.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Five de&s;erters came in from the enemy. Gen. Howe was ordered to take po&s;t again at Pine's Bridge.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;The Sieur Gerard, the late French Mini&s;|ter, came to camp, and dined at head-quarters. Two days before, Lieut. Gill, of the dragoons, pa|trolling
<PB N="219" REF="219">
in Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter, found a &s;uperior force in his rear, and no alternative but to &s;urrender or cut his way through them; he cho&s;e the latter, and forced his way, when he found a body of infantry &s;till behind the hor&s;e; the&s;e he al&s;o charged, and on his pa&s;&s;ing them, his hor&s;e was wounded and threw him, when he fell into the enemy's hands. Two of the Lieutenant's party, which con&s;i&s;ted of 24, were killed, and one taken pri&s;oner; the re&s;t e&s;caped &s;afe to their regiments.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s about this time appointed the Hon. John Adams, a Plenipotentiary, <HI>extra,</HI> to repair to France, to negociate for a peace with Great-Britain, when an opportunity occurred. The Briti&s;h fortified Gov|ernor's I&s;land, in the harbour of New-York, and appeared under great apprehen&s;ions of a vi&s;it from the French fleet under the Count D'E&s;taing. The troops and &s;hipping at Rhode-I&s;land were ordered to New-York.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;One de&s;erter from Verplank's Point. There was a cannonade between our infantry at Gra&s;&s;y Point and one of the enemy's guard-&s;hips, when the latter was driven from her moorings.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The light-infantry of Glover's brigade cro&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on to join Gen. Wayne. The Briti&s;h had a number of &s;hips ready to &s;ink in the channel, in ca&s;e a French fleet arrived, and attempt|ed to enter the harbour of New-York.

<P><PB N="220" REF="220">
Sir Jo&s;eph Yorke, the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter at the Hague, addre&s;&s;ed their High Mightine&s;&s;es on the 22d of the preceding July, in &s;uch language as evinced the feelings of the Briti&s;h nation. One de|&s;erter from Verplank's Point.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Gen. Sir Henry Clinton and Col. Robin|&s;on came up to Verplank's Point, in the &s;hip Fanny, and returned the next day; after which, the work|men at the points cea&s;ed working. The troops of the enemy &s;ickly at the points.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Two pri&s;oners of war were &s;ent up, and four de&s;erters came in. The Briti&s;h tran&s;ports were collected near Turtle Bay, and their &s;hips of war near the Narrows.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Seven de&s;erters came in from Verplank's Point; they reported that the enemy were putting their baggage, &s;ick, the women, &amp;c. on board the tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;14 pri&s;oners, &s;eamen, taken by Capt. Hal|let's company of New-York militia, two days before, on the North River, near Teller's Point, were &s;ent up, and one de&s;erter came in. Ju&s;t before &s;un-&s;et, a galley and &s;everal of the enemy's gun-boats came up the river as high as Fort Montgomery, and fired a number of &s;hot at &s;ome of our boats, and at the troops on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river; the Americans di&s;charged &s;ome mu&s;kets from the banks at the boats, and the latter returned down the river.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;One de&s;erter came in from the enemy.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;One de&s;erter from Verplank's Point.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from Verplank's, and reported, that the enemy were on the point of evacuating their works. The officer commanding the advance picket, &s;oon after &s;ent information that the works appeared to be on fire, and the &s;hipping &s;tanding down the river. Maj. Waldbridge, who

Sev|eral loaded &s;hells left by the enemy, in places where the fire would come at them, bur&s;t, but did no harm. The enemy left one hor&s;e, a few old intrenching tools, and &s;ome other trifles at the point. The tran&s;ports came to anchor off the mouth of Croten River; and information was received that the Brit|i&s;h grenadiers were on board tran&s;ports, in the river near Fort Wa&s;hington, and the 7th and 33d regiments in readine&s;s to embark at a moment's no|tice. Our General, le&s;t there might be an attempt made on Gen. Howe's divi&s;ion, ordered a detach|ment of 500 men, and half the Village picket, under the command of Col. Bradley, to march, and take po&s;t, during the night, towards the New Bridge, on Croten River, to cover the right flank of Howe's divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;About noon, the enemy's tran&s;ports came to &s;ail with the ebb, and beat down again&s;t the wind, and were &s;oon out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Col. Bradley's detachment returned to camp. The Colonel reported that he ob&s;erved large quantities of forage and fruit, in the fields between Verplank's Point and Croten River. To &s;ecure the forage, and cover the communication by King's Ferry, Gen. Wa&s;hington ordered our General to move down and encamp at Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The Connecticut line moved down and encamped on the high ground to the &s;outhward of Peek's Kill, and Maj. Gen. Howe's divi&s;ion was or|dered up to form a junction. The day before, the enemy landed a body of troops, &s;aid to be &s;ome thou|&s;ands &s;trong, at Amboy, and advanced towards Brun&s;wick. The light-infantry, and the Virginia line, were ordered to move down that way.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="222">
A man, who &s;aid he was a Lieutenant in the Brit|i&s;h &s;ervice, and who produced a commi&s;&s;ion, came out, pretending that he had been ill-treated, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts appeared to be deter|mined to fill up their regiments, and offered 300 dol|lars bounty to tho&s;e who would enli&s;t, in addition to the Continental bounty, which was 200 dollars, making the whole bounty 500 dollars. This morn|ing about 70 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els, many of them large &s;hips, pa&s;&s;ed down the Sound, having the garri&s;on of Rhode-I&s;land on board.</P>

This party, on its retreat, was met by 13 of the militia, who fired upon them, killed one man and four hor&s;es, and took the com|manding officer, Lieut. Simcoe, and one trooper, pri&s;oners. By the capture of Simcoe, the inhabit|ants were freed of a very enterpri&s;ing and trouble|&s;ome officer. The de&s;truction of the boats was the object of this enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Gen. Howe's divi&s;ion formed a junction with the Connecticut line, and encamped with them. Strong fatigue parties were daily employed on the works evacuated by the enemy at Verplank's and Stoney Points. Gen. Lincoln and the Count D'E&s;|taing, by the la&s;t accounts from Georgia, had form|ed a junction, and were determined to attack the enemy.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Maj. Bun&s;choten arrived at camp, with a detachment of Lieut. Col. Paulding's New-York levies; they were ordered to garri&s;on Stoney Point.</P>

<P>2d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a body of In|dians were advancing towards Fort Schuyler.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Two German Yaugers, with their rifles, came to our camp. At night, Col. Armand pro|ceeded with his corps from near Tarrytown to the vicinity of Morri&s;ania, to the hou&s;e of Alderman Leggit, where he &s;urpri&s;ed and took Maj. Bearmore and five others pri&s;oners. The &s;ecrecy, precaution, gallantry and di&s;cipline exhibited by the Colonel and his corps on this occa&s;ion did them much hon|our. In the capture of Maj. Bearmore, the inhab|itants of the adjacent country were relieved from the frequent excur&s;ions of a trouble&s;ome officer. The Briti&s;h augmented their troops on Staten-I&s;land.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from Col. Wurmb's Yaugers.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Five pri&s;oners taken by Lieut. Oakley, near Morri&s;ania, were &s;ent to camp. The enemy had a redoubt, called No. 8, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Haarlem Creek, nearly oppo&s;ite to the fort on Lau|rel Hill, and under the fire of its cannon, for the &s;e|curity of their advanced troops on the Morri&s;ania &s;ide.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the 23d of September, Gen. Lincoln and the Count D'E&s;|taing broke ground before the enemy's works, at Savannah in Georgia; and on the 5th of October,

batteries of 33 cannon and nine mortars, were open|ed and continued firing with intervals, until the 8th, without the wi&s;hed for effect.</P>

<P>23d.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Gates and his family came to camp from Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;The troops were moving to their different places of cantonment; many of the &s;oldiers, (as fine men as ever &s;tood in &s;hoes) were marched barefooted over the hard frozen ground, and with an a&s;toni&s;h|ing patience. Remember the&s;e things, ye Ameri|cans, in future times!</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief gave our Gen|eral the command of all the po&s;ts and troops on Hud&s;on's River, which Gen. Wa&s;hington very fre|quently called the key that locked the communica|tion between the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern States; and

<P>30th.&mdash;Early in the morning, Gen. Wa&s;hington cro&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on at King's-Ferry, into the Jer&s;ies. Maj. Gen. Gates was to proceed to Virginia&mdash;a &s;er|jeant, corporal, and three privates, were carried off by one Jo&s;eph M'Keel, a &s;ly, artful fellow, in the &s;ervice of the enemy, and who conducted many re|cruits from the country to them.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 2d.&mdash;Col. Armand, with &s;ome of his corps, went down to Morri&s;&s;ania, and took a Capt. Cruzer, of Bearmore's corps, and two men, pri&s;oners. At this time the troops were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for bread, and the hor&s;es for forage; the former occa|&s;ioned by the want of water at the mills. All the hor&s;es, except &s;uch as were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for incumbent duties, were ordered out into the coun|try. A man, who pretended to be a prophet, came out from the enemy&mdash;he more probably was a &s;py.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Col. Paulding's corps was ordered from Stoney Point to Poughkeep&s;ie, a great de&s;ertion hav|ing taken place in the corps. The Virginia line had marched to the &s;outhward&mdash;the enemy at New-York, preparing for the embarkation of a large body of troops, &s;aid to be upwards of 10,000, under the im|mediate command of Gen. Sir Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Three He&s;&s;ian de&s;erters came into our army; they reported that Gen. Matthews had the command of all the po&s;ts and troops on the north end of York I&s;land, above the bridge, &amp;c. The long talked of embarkation of troops at New-York, &s;ailed on the 26th. The fleet was &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of near 200 &s;ail. The enemy boa&s;ted that it was con|voyed by nearly 20 &s;hips of war; however, it was

well known that they had very few &s;hips of the line, and that they were under great apprehen&s;ions of falling in with a &s;uperior French force. They went to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Lieut. Col. Newhall, with 250 men prop|erly officered, marched to do duty on the lines.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;There was a great body of &s;now on the ground.</P>
<P>1780. <HI>January</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Early in the morning about 100 &s;oldiers belonging to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regi|ments, who had enli&s;ted, at different periods &s;ub&s;e|quent to January, 1777, for three years, pretending that their time of &s;ervice now expired, (although many of them had months to &s;erve, before their three years &s;ervice was completed) marched off with intent to go home: they were pur&s;ued and brought back: &s;ome of them were puni&s;hed; the greater part of them pardoned. Some others, at other po&s;ts, conducted in the &s;ame manner, and were treated as the fir&s;t mentioned. Tho&s;e who&s;e time of &s;ervice was expired, were all di&s;charged with honour.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;The &s;now had got to be about four feet deep on a level, and the troops were driven to great dif|ficulties in keeping open the communications to the po&s;ts&mdash;obtaining provi&s;ions, fuel, forage, &amp;c. and &s;o inten&s;e and &s;teady was the weather, that for more than twenty days there could not be di&s;covered the lea&s;t &s;ign of the remi&s;&s;ion of the &s;now in any places the mo&s;t open to the influences of the &s;un. The Hud&s;on &s;oon becoming pa&s;&s;able on the ice, the troops were comfortably &s;upplied with provi&s;ions; but ma|ny were in extreme want of cloathing.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The light-infantry belonging to the regi|ments in the Highlands, were joining their re&s;pective corps; the corps of light-infantry being &s;eparated for the winter.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;About du&s;k, the north redoubt was di&s;cov|ered
<PB N="227" REF="227">
to be on fire at the &s;outhwe&s;t corner, under the rampart, which was of timber; the fire was out of reach, and threatened the de&s;truction of the whole redoubt. A detachment from We&s;t-Point was order|ed over to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the garri&s;on of the re|doubt; but &s;o &s;trongly dovetailed and &s;trapped were the timbers of the rampart, that the fire for a time &s;eemed to baffle every exertion to extingui&s;h it. The ammunition, and about 100 barrels of &s;alted pro|vi&s;ions in the magazine, were &s;ea&s;onably removed by the garri&s;on; but the fire was not extingui&s;hed until about four o'clock on the morning of the 10th. All the officers and men di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion; but the conduct of Col. Lyman, Col. Sprout, and Capt. Drew, were con&s;picuous indeed, as was that of a Serjeant of the garri&s;on of the re|doubt, who, when all were on the point of quitting the redoubt, le&s;t the magazine &s;hould take fire and blow up, in&s;tantly ru&s;hed into the magazine, and did not quit it until he had thrown out every ca&s;k of powder, and box of ammunition depo&s;ited in it. If his name could be recollected, it &s;hould be in&s;erted.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Artificers and fatigue-men were ordered to repair the redoubt. The weather continued in|ten&s;ely cold. A man belonging to the garri&s;on of We&s;t-Point was frozen to death on his return from New-Wind&s;or to the point; and many &s;oldiers were fro&s;t-bitten. Maj. Gen. Putnam, who had gone home on furlough about this time, received a para|lytic &s;troke at Hartford in Connecticut, as he was on his return to the army.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The Hud&s;on was &s;o frozen, that travellers &s;afely cro&s;&s;ed the river on the ice at King's-Ferry. A He&s;&s;ian de&s;erter came in. Two days before, viz. on the 15th, Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling made a de&s;cent on Staten I&s;land, with a detachment, con&s;i&s;ting of about 2,500 infantry, and &s;ome artillery; a number
<PB N="228" REF="228">
of tents, arms, and &s;ome baggage, belonging to Col. Bu&s;kirk's regiment, was taken and brought off, with &s;ome liquors, &amp;c. Some of the American &s;oldiers de&s;erted to the enemy, and 17 were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from the enemy, and reported the &s;trength of the Briti&s;h at Fort Wa&s;hington. The people cro&s;&s;ed from New-York to Long-I&s;land on the ice. About this time, a de|tachment from Col. Mead's regiment of levies at Hor&s;eneck, and a number of volunteers from Green|wich, the former under the command of Captain Keeler, the latter under the command of Captain Lockwood, the whole about 80, marched to Morri&s;|&s;ania; and about one o'clock in the morning, made an attack on Col. Hatfield. They fir&s;t attacked the picket, killed 3, and drove the re&s;t into the Colonel's quarters. The Colonel and his men took to the chambers, and fired out at the windows, and down &s;tairs at tho&s;e who had entered the hou&s;e; it appear|ing difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;lodge them, the hou&s;e was in&s;tantly &s;et on fire, by putting a &s;traw bed into a clo&s;et, which compelled the enemy to jump out at the chamber windows, to avoid the flames. Colonel Hatfield, one Captain, one Lieutenant, one Quarter-Ma&s;ter, and 11 privates, were taken pri&s;oners and brought off. This was a pretty affair, but was a little tarni&s;hed on the return by &s;ome of the militia, who were fatigued, loitering on the road where they &s;uppo&s;ed there was no danger; but a party of hor&s;e pur&s;uing, overtook, killed and captured &s;everal of them.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, a fire broke out in the Quarter-Ma&s;ter's barrack at We&s;t-Point, which threatened the mo&s;t &s;erious and exten&s;ive damage. It had got to con&s;iderable height before it was di&s;covered; the barrack was con&s;e|quently con&s;umed to a&s;hes, notwith&s;tanding every
<PB N="229" REF="229">
exertion of the garri&s;on, which was numerous, Brig. Gen. Patter&s;on, who commanded the garri&s;on, not only di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, but al&s;o expo&s;ed his per&s;on to the flames to &s;ave another building, which was fortunately effected. The lo&s;s by the fire was con&s;iderable, both to the public and to individuals. The night before, viz. the 25th, a detachment of the enemy, &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 500 men, made an ex|cur&s;ion from Staten I&s;land, over the ice, to Eliza|beth-Town, in the Jer&s;ies, and completely &s;urpri&s;ed the picket po&s;ted there, con&s;i&s;ting of a Major and 100 men, properly officered; it was &s;aid that not a gun was fired, nor a man hurt. The enemy &s;ur|rounded the hou&s;es, and took the troops a&s;leep.&mdash;He who &s;uffers him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed, through the want of proper precaution, his character (&s;ays a great military writer) is irretrievable.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;At two o'clock in the morning, the north redoubt was di&s;covered to be on fire again in the top of the bomb-proof, between the &s;ally-port and the door. Every exertion was made by the garri|&s;on of the redoubt, and detachments &s;ent to their aid, to put out the fire, but it was &s;o much out of reach, and &s;pread among the joints of the large timbers, that it was not extingui&s;hed until about two o'clock on the morning of the 3d. The redoubt received con&s;iderable damage, and would have been totally de&s;troyed, had it not been for the unwearied exertions of the troops, day and night, during the whole of the time; and much credit was due to Lieut. Col. Vo&s;e, and the other officers who com|manded. By a more accurate account of the lo&s;s at the Quarter-Ma&s;ter's barrack at We&s;t-Point, it appear|ed that 6 marques, 26 hor&s;eman's tents, 80 common tents, 900 knap&s;acks, 250 narrow axes, and a num|ber of other articles were burnt and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 3d, about 9 o'clock, the
<PB N="230" REF="230">
enemy made an attack on Lieut. Col. Thom&s;on, who commanded the troops on the lines; the Colo|nel's force con&s;i&s;ted of 250 men, in five companies, properly officered; they were in&s;tructed to move between Croten River and the White Plains, Hud|&s;on's River and Bedford; never to remain long at any one place, that the enemy might not be able to learn their manner of doing duty, or form a plan for &s;triking them in any particular &s;ituation. The Col|onel had for &s;ome days taken po&s;t him&s;elf at <HI>Young's,</HI> not far from the White Plains. Capt. Wat&s;on, with his company, was with the Lieut. Colonel; Capt. Rob|erts and Capt. Stoddard, with their companies, were on the right; Capt. Lieut. Farley and Capt. Cooper on the left. The force of the enemy con&s;i&s;ted of the four flank companies of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Briti&s;h regiments of guards&mdash;detachments from two He&s;&s;ian battalions&mdash;&s;ome mounted yaugers, and mounted ref|ugees. The whole under the command of Col. Norton, of the guards. The roads were &s;o filled with &s;now, that the enemy advanced but &s;lowly, and were oblig|ed to leave their field-pieces behind on the road. They were di&s;covered at a di&s;tance by Mr. Campbell, one of our guides, who, from the goodne&s;s of his hor&s;e, reconnoitred them pretty near. He gave the Lieutenant-Colonel notice of their advancing, and that their force was con&s;iderable, and advi&s;ed him to take a &s;tronger po&s;ition a little in his rear. But the Lieutenant-Colonel was very confident that the enemy were only a body of hor&s;e, and that he could ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;e them, and would not quit his ground. The enemy fir&s;t attacked a &s;mall advance-guard, con&s;i&s;ting of a Serjeant and 8 men, who behaved well, and meant to reach the main body in &s;ea&s;on; but were prevented by the hor&s;e, and all taken pri&s;|oners. The enemy's hor&s;e &s;oon appeared in &s;ight of the Americans, and di&s;charged their rifles at long
<PB N="231" REF="231">
&s;hot, and waited the coming up of the infantry, when a warm action commenced; the enemy &s;cat|tered, taking the advantage of the ground and trees in the orchard, and clo&s;ing up on all &s;ides. The 3 companies of the detachment, which had joined, fought well. After about 15 minutes' &s;harp conflict, our troops broke; &s;ome took into the hou&s;e, and others made off; the enemy's hor&s;e ru&s;hing on at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and the whole &s;houting. At this time, the two flank companies came up, but finding how matters &s;tood, judged it be&s;t to retreat, Capt. Stodder's company giving a fire or two at long &s;hot, Capt. Cooper's, from their di&s;tance, not firing at all. Some who were engaged effected their e&s;cape, others were overtaken by the hor&s;e. The enemy collected what pri&s;oners they could, &s;et Mr. Young's hou&s;e and buildings on fire, and returned. Of the Amer|icans, 13 were killed dead on the &s;pot, and Capt. Roberts, who was mortally wounded, lived but a few minutes. Seventeen others were wounded, &s;ev|eral of whom died. Lieut. Col. Thom&s;on of Mar|&s;hall's, Capt. Wat&s;on of Greaton's, Capt. Lieut. Far|ley of We&s;&s;on's, Lieut. Burley of Tupper's, Lieut. Maynard of Greaton's, En&s;ign Fowler of Nixon's, En&s;ign Bradley of Bigelow's, with 89 others, were taken pri&s;oners. The enemy left 3 men dead on the field, and a Captain of grenadiers was wounded in the hip, and a Lieutenant of infantry in the thigh. The Briti&s;h, in their account of the action, acknowl|edged that they had 5 men killed, and 18 wounded. Lieut. Col. Badlam, with the relief for the lines, was at the time of the action far advanced on his march, but not within reach of tho&s;e engaged.</P>
<P>One Mayhew, a pedler, well known in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, was of this detachment; he made off up the road, but finding the hor&s;e ru&s;hing on, he &s;truck off into the &s;now, almo&s;t up to his hips. Two of the
<PB N="232" REF="232">
enemy's hor&s;e turned into his track after him; and, gaining fa&s;t upon him, he a&s;ked them if they would give him quarter; they replied, "Yes, you dog, we will quarter you." This was twice repeated; when Mayhew, finding them inflexible, determined to give them one &s;hot before he was quartered; and, turning round, di&s;charged his piece at the fir&s;t hor&s;e|man, who cried out, "The ra&s;cal has broke my leg;" when both of them turned their hor&s;es round and went off, leaving Mayhew at liberty to tread back his path to the road, and come off.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;A body of the enemy's hor&s;e, &s;aid to be about 300, and the 7th Briti&s;h regiment, came over from Long-I&s;land to We&s;t-Che&s;ter on the ice. The troops in New-York, about this time, drew four days' provi&s;ions, which they were directed to keep cooked, and the troops to be in readine&s;s to move on the &s;horte&s;t notice, with arms and blankets only. A number of &s;leighs were collected, and &s;ome heavy cannon were drawn out; whether an attempt on Morri&s;town or the Highlands was the object, was not known. Several de&s;erters came in from the enemy, and in this month there were &s;ome de&s;ertions from the American &s;outhern regiments to the en|emy. The enemy al&s;o made an excur&s;ion in the Jer&s;ies, as far as Elizabeth-Town, and carried off a great quantity of plunder.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Some &s;mall parties of the enemy were out towards the White Plains.</P>
<P>Our General having obtained leave, from the Commander in Chief, to make a vi&s;it to his friends in New-England, commenced his journey ea&s;tward, on the 21&s;t of February, and reached his hou&s;e in Roxbury on the 29th. It appeared that the winter had been as &s;evere, and the &s;now as deep, in the New-England States, as in the Highlands of New-York.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="233">
<HI>March</HI> 8th.&mdash;Our General addre&s;&s;ed the Hon. Council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on the importance of the then moment for recruiting their battalions.</P>
<P>By the ma&s;ter of a flag from Bermuda, informa|tion was received, that the fleet, in pa&s;&s;ing from New-York to the &s;outhward, the preceding Decem|ber, &s;uffered con&s;iderably; and that an ordnance &s;hip was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;A privateer &s;hip, of 18 guns, prize to the Tartar privateer, was &s;ent into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;The Committee of the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were i&s;&s;uing notes for the deprecia|tion of the pay of the troops of their line: the&s;e were &s;old at a very great di&s;count.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;A rich Jamaica &s;hip, prize to the conti|nental frigate Dean, arrived &s;afe in Bo&s;ton harbour. The &s;ame day, there was a report that Sir Henry Clinton had arrived at South-Carolina, with the Briti&s;h troops, which &s;ailed from New-York in De|cember.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olu|tion, granting a premium of &pound; 30 per man for each recruit that &s;hould be enli&s;ted and pa&s;s mu&s;ter for their line.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;A Marblehead privateer, the Aurora, &s;ent in a prize &s;hip, with 1600 barrels of flour&mdash;1400 do. of beef and pork; and dry goods to the amount of &pound; 700 &s;terling.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;News was received of a mo&s;t ob&s;ti|nate engagement in Europe, between the French frigate, Sueveillant, Capt. Conedic, of 36 guns, and the Briti&s;h frigate, Quebec, Capt. Farmer, of the &s;ame force. The French frigate had 32 men killed, and 92 wounded. The Quebec blew up, and her whole crew, 300, except 40, were lo&s;t, either in ac|tion or in the explo&s;ion. This engagement did honour to the bravery of both nations.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="234">
The depreciation of the continental money rap|idly increa&s;ed; many people withheld their mer|chandize and produce from &s;ale, and the times were truly embarra&s;&s;ing. An embarkation of &s;ome thou|&s;ands of He&s;&s;ian troops took place at New-York for Carolina. In the cour&s;e of this month, the Mary|land line of the army, and three companies of artille|ry, marched to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;News was received that the Briti&s;h had got their &s;hipping over the bar, at Charle&s;ton; that the continental frigates, in the harbour, were hauled up, and their guns taken out and mounted on batteries: the garri&s;on of Charle&s;ton numerous.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The privateers Franklin and Jack &s;ent in|to Salem a large letter-of-marque &s;hip, having on board 1,000 barrels of pork and beef, 750 barrels of flour, 800 firkins of butter, and dry goods to the amount of &pound; 15,000; &s;he was from London, bound to New-York.</P>
<P>During this month, the enemy made two excur|&s;ions to Paramus, where they killed and took a num|ber of Americans; Maj. Byles, of the Penn&s;ylvania line, was mortally wounded, and died the next day. The enemy burnt Mr. G. Hoper's hou&s;es and mills; the militia turned out &s;piritedly, repul&s;ed and pur&s;ued the enemy. By accounts from Europe, the American cau&s;e was viewed in a very favourable light, by the Courts in that part of the world.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The French frigate Hermeoue, Capt. La|touch, arrived at Bo&s;ton; in whom came the Mar|quis de la Fayette, and &s;uite, from France. The in|habitants of Bo&s;ton exhibited the greate&s;t demon&s;tra|tions of joy, on the occa&s;ion. The next morning the Marquis, Capt. Latouch, and other officers, made a vi&s;it to our General: the Marquis, the day before, on his landing at Hancock's Wharf, was received by a number of Continental officers, and e&s;corted to his
<PB N="235" REF="235">
lodgings; after which, he paid his re&s;pects to the Honorable Legi&s;lature, who were then in &s;e&s;&s;ion; in the evening there were rejoicings.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 2d.&mdash;The Marquis de la Fayette &s;et out from Bo&s;ton, for the army.</P>
<P>During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, they received an order from Congre&s;s, in favour of the State, for 2,000,000 dollars, to reimbur&s;e the State in part of the expen&s;e of the Penob&s;cot expe|dition, which had greatly involved the State. The enemy having taken po&s;t at Penob&s;cot, the Legi&s;la|ture of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, without applying to Congre&s;s, determined to di&s;lodge them; and, for this purpo&s;e, ordered a body of militia to be detached, under the command of Brig. Gen. Lovell; and, in addition to their own State ve&s;&s;els, procured a number of pri|vateers, belonging to individuals. The expedition was attempted; the &s;hipping arrived &s;afe in Penob|&s;cot Bay; the troops, or a part of them, were de|barked to attack the enemy, but they did not &s;ucceed in their attempt. The armed ve&s;&s;els, in&s;tead of cruizing off the harbour, where they could have had &s;ea room, remained in the bay. The enemy &s;ent a naval force to the relief of the po&s;t, which arrived, and found the American &s;hipping in the river, who immediately ran up as far as they could, where the whole were de&s;troyed, and the militia and &s;eamen left to find their way home through the woods. This was an unfortunate affair to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who&s;e privateers, before, were numerous, able and active, and greatly annoyed the enemy; and, had it not been for this blow, would have been of great public benefit, by depriving the enemy of many of their provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els, and of increa&s;ing provi&s;ions in our own country. Congre&s;s, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed to de|cline bearing the expen&s;e, as they had never been
<PB N="236" REF="236">
con&s;ulted re&s;pecting the expedition; but they finally con&s;ented to a reimbur&s;ement.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s ordered, that 800 men, in the pay of the United States, &s;hould cover and protect the Ea&s;tern Country the en&s;uing &s;ummer.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;The gentlemen of Bo&s;ton gave a ball to the French and American officers.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The Hermeone frigate, Capt. Latouch, &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton harbour, on a cruize.</P>
<P>A number of very valuable prizes, taken by the American cruizers, were &s;ent into different ports.</P>
<P>The 19th exhibited a mo&s;t extraordinary phenom|enon. The wind, in the morning, was &s;outherly, a moderate breeze; the &s;un &s;hone a little after it was up, but was &s;oon clouded: there was &s;ome thunder and moderate &s;howers. A little after 10 o'clock, the clouds exhibited a yellowi&s;h ca&s;t, and every object &s;eemed to pre&s;ent a bra&s;&s;y hue; it &s;oon after began to grow dark, which gradually increa&s;ed; between eleven and twelve, it became nece&s;&s;ary to light can|dles, to do hou&s;ehold bu&s;ine&s;s. The darkne&s;s in|crea&s;ed until near one o'clock, P. M. the inhabitants dining by candle-light. About one, the darkne&s;s be|gan to decrea&s;e, and went off gradually, as it came on; between three and four, P. M. the u&s;ual light was re&s;tored. The evening, although the moon was at the full, was remarkably dark, and there was a &s;prinkling of rain&mdash;the people were in great con|&s;ternation. This phenomenon, in the opinion of our General, although he has no preten&s;ions to a&s;|tronomy, was produced by <HI>oppo&s;ite winds</HI> forcing to|gether a va&s;t body of &s;moak and vapours, (the air had been &s;moaky for &s;ome days before) which, from the light &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, as they accumulat|ed, a&s;cended, forming, from top to bottom, &s;uch a body, as to cau&s;e the darkne&s;s; and yet, &s;o open were the particles, as to admit the &s;un's rays &s;o far,
<PB N="237" REF="237">
as to cau&s;e the bra&s;&s;y appearance: had the atmo&s;|phere been heavy, the vapours would probably have conden&s;ed, and rain, in torrents, would have en&s;ued. Some ob&s;ervations made by our General, &s;ome years &s;ince the foregoing, on the darkne&s;s in Canada, and which, on the afternoon of the preceding day, he no|ticed at Roxbury, and remarked thereon, afford &s;trong collateral evidence that the foregoing opinion was not wholly unfounded.</P>
<P>As the learned and curious wi&s;h to a&s;certain, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the true cau&s;e of the phenomenon, we throw in tho&s;e rough materials, which our ob&s;erva|tion, at the time, collected, that they may be &s;haped by tho&s;e of greater &s;kill, for the information and &s;at|isfaction of an enlightened public. Tho&s;e called the dark days, in Canada, were the 9th, 15th and 16th of October, 1785; but the greate&s;t degree of dark|ne&s;s was on Sunday, the 16th, when the darkne&s;s was &s;o great as to render the u&s;e of candles nece&s;&s;ary in the churches and families: it is &s;aid to have been as dark as a dark night.</P>
<P>On the 9th, at Roxbury, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the wind was at &s;outh-ea&s;t, and then at &s;outh-we&s;t; the day fair, cool and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The 15th, the prevailing wind was ea&s;terly; the day was cloudy and foggy; about 2 o'clock, P. M. it was uncommonly dark, and there was an oppo&s;ite wind from the &s;outh-we&s;t. There were &s;everal hard claps of thunder at a di&s;tance, and a few drops of rain. Towards evening, the &s;un was vi&s;ible, but ap|peared very red, and the clouds exhibited a bra&s;&s;y complexion, &s;o &s;imilar to the dark day in May, 1780, as to be noticed and compared; in the evening the wind was &s;outherly.</P>
<P>The 16th, which was the dark day in Canada, the wind, there at oppo&s;ite points, N. E. and S. W. was at Roxbury S. W. The day was fair, warm and
<PB N="238" REF="238">
plea&s;ant; from which it &s;eems to be obvious, that the body of &s;moak and vapour, with which the at|mo&s;phere was fraught on the 15th, which pervaded a region which comprehended Canada and a part of New-England at lea&s;t, was, by the &s;trength of the &s;outh-we&s;t wind in the night, forced northward, and being &s;till oppo&s;ed by the north-ea&s;t wind, pre&s;&s;ing on the other &s;ide, produced the accumulation of &s;moak and vapour which occa&s;ioned the darkne&s;s; and if the north-ea&s;t wind had prevailed again&s;t the &s;outh-we&s;t, the darkne&s;s would probably have been in New-England.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Capt. Latouch returned from his cruize; he ran into Penob&s;cot Bay, and ca&s;t anchor, firing &s;everal &s;ignal guns. Two Briti&s;h &s;loops of war, which were at anchor, upon the approach of the Hermeone, came to &s;ail, and ran up the river. Capt. Latouch lay at anchor until he took a plan of the enemy's po&s;t. Our General intended to have com|menced his journey for the army on Monday, the 29th of May; but on the afternoon of the preced|ing day, he received a letter from Gen. Wa&s;hington, dated the 15th, in which his Excellency ob&s;erved, "I have the plea&s;ure to inform you, in &s;trict confi|dence, that we have authentic advices of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's determination to &s;end a re&s;pect|able armament of &s;ea and land forces to operate on the continent, and that the period is not remote when we may expect their arrival." The Com|mander in Chief added, that the &s;eizing of Halifax was an object with the French; and our General was in&s;tructed to obtain, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, the ex|act &s;tate of the Briti&s;h in that quarter, as to their <HI>works, garri&s;ons</HI> and <HI>troops;</HI> all of which was &s;hortly after a&s;certained.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;The Hermeone fell down, in order to proceed on a cruize to the &s;outhward. The troops
<PB N="239" REF="239">
at We&s;t-Point at this time were very &s;hort of pro|vi&s;ions, and without rum.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s and the Commander in Chief called up|on the &s;everal States to complete their battalions of the army with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. The enemy at New-York were under great apprehen&s;ions of a vi&s;it from the French, and were &s;aid to have prepared a number of hulks of different &s;izes to &s;ink in the channel.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 6th.&mdash;News was received, that a French fleet had been &s;een at &s;ea, in latitude 33, &s;tanding E. N. E.</P>
<P>About this time, Capt. Latouch &s;ent into Dart|mouth a prize brig, having 1700 firkins of butter, 150 boxes of candles, and 150 boxes of &s;oap on board. The Legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts ordered a draft to be made from the militia, to complete their Continental battalions. The drafts were to rendez|vous at Springfield.</P>

<P>About this time, an engagement happened between the Hermeone and a Briti&s;h man-of-war, which la&s;t|ed near two gla&s;&s;es; it was a drawn battle. Capt.

<P>15th.&mdash;At 11 o'clock, A. M. our General &s;et out from his hou&s;e, in Roxbury, for Providence, where he arrived the next day, at 2 o'clock, P. M. was met at Patucket Bridge by Deputy-Governor Bowen, and a number of other gentlemen, who attended him into town.</P>
<P>On Friday, the 2d of June, the Continental frig|ate, the Trumbull, James Nichol&s;on commander, had an engagement with a Briti&s;h frigate of 36 guns, which la&s;ted five hours. The Trumbull had all her ma&s;ts wounded, 8 men killed, and 31 wounded. The Briti&s;h frigate was &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uffered much.</P>
<P>In this month, a body of the enemy, under the command of Gen. Knyphau&s;en, landed in the Jer|&s;ies, and moved towards Springfield. Some &s;kir|mi&s;hing en&s;ued; Col. Angel's regiment &s;uffered con|&s;iderably.
<PB N="241" REF="241">
A number of men were killed on both &s;ides. It was now fully confirmed that the enemy's &s;hipping pa&s;&s;ed Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's I&s;land, in South-Carolina, on the 9th of April, with a fre&s;h breeze, by which means they received but little dam|age: they came to anchor between Fort John&s;on and Charle&s;ton, and ju&s;t out of reach of the latter. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton had now advanced his ap|proaches &s;o far, as to be erecting his batteries. The garri&s;on made a good defence, but, on the 12th of May, were obliged to &s;urrender. Of the Ameri|cans, 1 Colonel, 1 Aid-de-camp, 6 Captains, 3 Lieu|tenants, 10 Serjeants, and 68 rank and file, were kill|ed; 1 Major, 2 Captains, 5 Lieutenants, 18 Ser|jeants, and 114 rank and file were wounded. Maj. Gen. Lincoln, with Brigadiers Moultrie, M'Into&s;h, Woodford, Scott, Duportail and Hogan, with 9 Col|onels, 14 Lieut. Colonels, 15 Majors, 84 Captains and Capt. Lieutenants, 84 Lieutenants, 32 Second Lieuten|ants and En&s;igns, 209 non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers, 140 drums and fifes, and 1977 rank and file, including &s;ick and wounded, of the Continental troops, mak|ing in the whole, 2564, were taken pri&s;oners. Be|&s;ides the foregoing, it was &s;aid that there were about 500 naval officers and &s;eamen, 250 Charle&s;ton mili|tia, and 500 country militia, al&s;o taken&mdash;the ene|my pretended many more. About 20 American &s;oldiers de&s;erted to the enemy, during the &s;iege. Be&s;ides the artillery and &s;tores which fell into the hands of the enemy, (the former being 220 pieces, from 3 to 26 pounders) the Continental frigates, Providence, Bo&s;ton, Ranger, and Queen of France, with 4 State gallies, and one French &s;hip of war, were lo&s;t. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that about 500 Ameri|can men, women and children, were killed, during
<PB N="242" REF="242">
the &s;iege. The enemy's lo&s;s, in killed and wound|ed, was con&s;iderable. The enemy broke ground be|fore the town on the fir&s;t of April, at the di&s;tance of 800 yards from the American works. Before the &s;urrender of the place, it was contemplated in Coun|cil of War, to embark the garri&s;on, except about one regiment, on board the &s;hipping, in the night, and run up the river, and land them; thereby to &s;ave the army, leaving tho&s;e in the town to make the be&s;t terms they could. This opinion for &s;ome time pre|vailed, but it was afterwards given up.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h fleet left Charle&s;ton, &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 2 &s;hips of the line, 2 fifties, 2 forty-gun|&s;hips, 6 or 7 frigates, and between 80 and 90 tran&s;|ports; near 2,000 negroes were put on board the fleet. Lord Cornwallis, with about 2,000 men, marched from Charle&s;ton towards North-Carolina. A few days after the &s;urrender of Charle&s;ton to the Briti&s;h troops, the grand ar&s;enal, wherein was de|po&s;ited all the arms, &amp;c. taken from the Americans, took fire and blew up, by which it was &s;aid a num|ber of men were killed and wounded. The lo&s;s of Charle&s;ton rou&s;ed the country, and &s;eemed to give a check to that &s;pirit of avarice and &s;peculation which had but too much prevailed in all places, and a de|termination, by every exertion, to drive the enemy from the country, appeared to be catching from brea&s;t to brea&s;t.</P>
<P>At Rhode-I&s;land, every preparation was making for the reception of the French fleet and army. The hand&s;ome college at Providence was given up for a ho&s;pital. The American privateers had been very &s;ucce&s;sful, and many valuable prizes were &s;ent in.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Mon&s;ieur Corney, a French Commi&s;&s;ary, arrived at Providence. About this time, it was &s;u&s;|pected that the enemy at New-York had &s;ome in|tentions
<PB N="243" REF="243">
of an attempt on our po&s;ts in the Highlands; and &s;ome of their &s;hipping were up the Hud&s;on.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 30th, Capt. Latouch, in the Hermeone, &s;ailed from Newport harbour. The &s;ame day, the Briti&s;h frigate, the Flora, which was &s;unk in Newport harbour nearly two years before, was weighed; &s;he had a quantity of provi&s;ions on board.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;News was received that the enemy were again in motion in the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;News was received of the &s;ailing of the French fleet, which left France the 2d of May. It was &s;aid in France, that if the fleet fell to the north|ward, it would vi&s;it Halifax; if to the &s;outhward, it would proceed to Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>A great unea&s;ine&s;s, at this time, prevailed in Ire|land.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;The anniver&s;ary of American Independence was celebrated at Providence, by a di&s;charge of 13 cannon from the park. Governor Greene, Mon|&s;ieur de Corney, and a number of other gentlemen, dined with our General.</P>
<P>By the la&s;t accounts, the main army was at Rama|paugh, in the Jer&s;ies. In the &s;kirmi&s;h, which hap|pened &s;ome time before, near Springfield, the Ameri|cans had about 40 killed and wounded.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;At one o'clock, A. M. our General re|ceived advice, by expre&s;s, that the fleet of our illu&s;|trious ally was &s;een off Newport, the evening before. Before &s;un-ri&s;e an expre&s;s was &s;ent forward to Gen. Wa&s;hington with the agreeable tidings, and our Gen|eral immediately prepared to proceed to Newport, but the day being calm, the packet did not reach the town until 12 o'clock at night. General Rocham|beau had gone on &s;hore in the evening. Early the next morning our General went on &s;hore, and waited on the Count; from which moment the warme&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="244">
friend&s;hip commenced between our General, the Count, and all the French officers. After breakfa&s;t, our General went on board the Duke de Burgoyne man-of-war, to pay his re&s;pects to the Chevalier de <HI>Ternay,</HI> who commanded the &s;quadron, where the &s;ame friend&s;hip was commenced. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even &s;ail of the line, viz. the Duke de Burgoyne, of 80 guns; la Neptune, la Conquerant of 74; la Jazen, la Seville, la Ardent, and la Provence of 64; and the Fauta&s;que of 64, armed enflute with 40 guns as a ho&s;pital &s;hip; two frigates, and two bombs, with a number of tran&s;ports, having on board about 5,000 troops, be&s;ides the marines, the &s;oldiers, and &s;ailors, &s;omething &s;ickly. The joy in the town of Newport was great. At 11 o'clock, A. M. the Admiral &s;alu|ted the town with 13 cannon, which was returned by the di&s;charge of the &s;ame number. In the eve|ning the town was beautifully illuminated, and fire|works exhibited, to the great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfac|tion of our allies. The fleet, on its pa&s;&s;age to Amer|ica, fell in with five Briti&s;h &s;hips of the line, who, after firing a few broad-&s;ides, bore away.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Our General dined with the Count de Rochambeau.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;The Chevalier de Ternay, and the princi|pal officers of the &s;quadron, came on &s;hore.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Count de Rochambeau, and the General Officers of the French army, dined with our Gen|eral.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;A number of the Field-Officers of the French regiments, dined with our General in the mo&s;t happy fraternity.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Four &s;ail of &s;hips of war, two of them &s;uppo&s;ed to be of 40 or 50 guns, appeared in the offing; they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be Briti&s;h. The &s;ame day, the Chevalier de Ternay, and the princi|pal officers of the fleet, dined with our General.
<PB N="245" REF="245">
In the afternoon the remains of the officer, who was &s;ome time before wounded on board the Hermeone, and died of tho&s;e wounds, was interred with military honours.</P>
<P>The mi&s;&s;ing tran&s;port of the fleet, with troops on board, arrived &s;afe in Bo&s;ton harbour, and the troops marched to Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Our General dined with the Count.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;The frigates of the &s;quadron came to &s;ail in the morning; but the wind being a-head, they were obliged to come to anchor. Intelligence was received that Admiral Greaves, with five or &s;ix &s;ail of the line, arrived at Sandy-Hook on the 13th.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, in the afternoon, 15 or 16 &s;ail of Briti&s;h &s;hips of war appeared in the offing; more than one half of them were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;hips of the line. At &s;un-&s;et, they appeared to be coming too under Block-I&s;land. The frigates, which attempted to get out in the morning, returned at evening.</P>
<P>Apprehending that the Briti&s;h fleet might be cruizing off, with a view to intercept the &s;econd divi&s;ion of the French fleet, which was expected &s;oon to arrive, our General &s;ent off expre&s;&s;es to head-quarters, Bo&s;ton and Hartford, advi&s;ing of the Brit|i&s;h fleet being off Newport&mdash;that di&s;patch-boats might be &s;ent out to apprize the French, and point them to another port. Several works and batteries, next to the harbour, were mantled with cannon.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The Briti&s;h fleet were cruizing off all the day, and rather nearer than they were the preceding day. Eighteen or nineteen &s;ail were counted, eight or nine of which appeared to be of the line. The French &s;quadron kept their former &s;tation, in the harbour, and in the mo&s;t perfect readine&s;s for ac|tion. The army was in the &s;ame preparedne&s;s, and batteries &s;o con&s;tructed as to afford a heavy cro&s;s|fire with the &s;hipping, in the entrance of the har|bour.
<PB N="246" REF="246">
All ve&s;&s;els and boats were forbid pa&s;&s;ing out of the harbour in the night.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;The Briti&s;h were cruizing off&mdash;early in the morning one of their frigates was near in. Col. Greene's regiment of continental troops took po&s;t at Butt's Hill, Bri&s;tol, and Howland's Ferries. Fif|ty French &s;oldiers, from the army, were &s;ent on board each of the &s;hips of the line. By accounts from We&s;t-Point, it appeared that many recruits had joined, and were joining, the American army.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h fleet continued off Newport. In the afternoon, 12 &s;ail were at anchor to the ea&s;t of Block-I&s;land, and 4 frigates cruizing between that I&s;land and Point Judith. In the evening, the Mar|quis de la Fayette came to town, from head-quar|ters.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Sir Henry Clinton intended an attempt upon the French army, with 10,000 men; upon which 1500 of the militia of Rhode-I&s;land, and Brigadier Godfrey's brigade of militia, of the county of Bri&s;tol, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, were called in to Tiverton; and the three months' men, who were de&s;tined to the main army, &s;uch of them as belonged to the counties of Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex, Plymouth, Worce&s;ter, Barn&s;table and Bri&s;tol, were ordered to march to Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;A confirmation of the intention of Sir Henry Clinton, again&s;t Newport, was received from the neighbourhood of New-York. In con&s;equence of which, the whole militia of the State of Rhode-I&s;land was called in. Col. Tyler's, Col. Perry's, and Maj. Bullard's militia regiments, in addition to Brig|adier Godfrey's, from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Signals were fixed as far as Watch-Hill, and every thing put in train for the giving in&s;tant notice, both by day and night, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould approach towards the place.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="247">
27th.&mdash;The wind being fre&s;h at &s;outh-we&s;t, and the air hazy, the privateer &s;hip Wa&s;hington, Capt. Munroe, ran by the Briti&s;h fleet, and pa&s;&s;ed up the harbour. The &s;tock on Conanicut-I&s;land was or|dered to be taken off. Howland's Ferry was to be well &s;ecured on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the enemy's &s;hipping, which were in the Sound, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken in troops at White&s;tone, had come to &s;ail, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward; on which, the mi|litia who were coming in, except the three months' men, were permitted to return home. The militia had di&s;covered great zeal and alertne&s;s on the occa|&s;ion. About noon, the Briti&s;h &s;hips that had been at anchor off Block-I&s;land, came to &s;ail and &s;tood out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day a brig, with di&s;patches from France, pa&s;&s;ed up the harbour; &s;he ran on one of the wrecks, and &s;unk immediately.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Our General received letters from Gen. Wa&s;hington, Gen. Howe, Gen. Par&s;ons, and Gov. Trumbull, intimating that the enemy intended an attack on Newport; that about 150 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els were in the Sound; that about 8000 troops were to be employed on the expedition; and that Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was to command in per&s;on; that 26 heavy cannon, &s;ome mortars, &amp;c. were put on board. In con&s;equence of this intelligence, the mi|litia were again called in. The next day (Augu&s;t 1&s;t) our General received the following letter from Gen. Wa&s;hington.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED here la&s;t night; having met your favours of the 25th and 26th at Paramus, where the army then lay. Immediately upon hearing that the
<PB N="248" REF="248">
tran&s;ports, with the troops, which had been &s;ome days on board, had &s;ailed ea&s;tward, I put the army in motion again; they will cro&s;s the ferry to day, and will be joined by the troops from hence. I pro|po&s;e moving as rapidly as po&s;&s;ible down towards King&s;bridge, which will either oblige the enemy to abandon their project again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land, or may afford us an opportunity of &s;triking them to advan|tage in this quarter, if Sir Henry Clinton has carri|ed with him the number of men reported (eight thou&s;and) and with le&s;s than which, I think, he would &s;carcely ri&s;k an attempt upon Count Ro|chambeau, reinforced by the militia.</P>
<P>I entirely approve of the mea&s;ures you have tak|en for calling in aid, and have the &s;tronge&s;t hopes that if Sir Henry &s;hould venture upon an attack, that he will meet a reception very different from what he expects. You know the critical &s;ituation in which this army will be in a po&s;ition below, and how much depends upon con&s;tant intelligence of the motions of the enemy. I &s;hall direct relays of ex|pre&s;&s;es the whole way, between this army and you, to convey intelligence in the mo&s;t expeditious man|ner. The neare&s;t expre&s;s to you will be upon Tow|er-Hill; and Gen. Greene advi&s;es, that you &s;hould keep two whale-boats, to communicate with him, by South-Ferry, &s;o long as that pa&s;&s;age &s;hall be &s;afe; and if that &s;hould be interrupted, by Bi&s;&s;ell's Har|bour.</P>

<P>The militia came in with great &s;pirit; they were formed into brigades, and every di&s;po&s;ition made for in&s;tant and vigorous defence, at every point where it was &s;uppo&s;ed an attempt might be made.
<PB N="249" REF="249">
The batteries were &s;trengthened, a very &s;trong one erected on Ro&s;e-I&s;land, and redoubts on Coa&s;ter's-I&s;land: the &s;trong works on Butt's-Hill pu&s;hed: avenues acro&s;s the fields, by the &s;horte&s;t routes, were opened, from the encampment of the French army, to tho&s;e points where their in&s;tant pre&s;ence was judg|ed nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;uch marks fixed, at &s;mall di&s;tan|ces from each other, as to prevent any mi&s;take in the route, either by day or night; indeed, no one precaution was omitted, or probable advantage of ground or &s;ituation neglected. Had Sir Henry made the attempt which he menaced, he would un|doubtedly have met a warm reception; but for &s;ome rea&s;on or other he gave up his de&s;ign, and the mili|tia were again &s;ent home. Perhaps on no occa&s;ion did the militia di&s;cover more ardour, in pre&s;&s;ing to the field, or more regularity when there, than at that time, which was every where te&s;tified by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Our General had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to the Com|mander in Chief, to join the main army, that he might enjoy that command, to which he was at that time entitled, viz. the right wing; to which Gen. Wa&s;hington, in a letter dated Augu&s;t 3d, replied:</P>
<P><Q>As to your coming on to the army immediately, I &s;hall leave it entirely to your&s;elf to act in the affair as you plea&s;e. Your command is, and will always be ready for you; however, if you find your pre&s;|ence where you are nece&s;&s;ary, and that it will con|tribute to the accommodation of our allies, and to the cultivation of harmony, (matters about which I am very anxious) it may po&s;&s;ibly be more eligible for you to remain longer, as we &s;hall not probably have any in&s;tant active operations. But, as I have already &s;aid, do in the matter as you like, and as circum&s;tances may decide.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="250">
And in a &s;ub&s;equent letter &s;ome days after, he ob|&s;erved: "As to your wi&s;hes to join the army, as I ob|&s;erved before, your aid may be very material to the Count; and as we have no pro&s;pect of immediate ac|tive operations, I would rather wi&s;h you to remain with him longer. I thought it e&s;&s;ential in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance that there &s;hould be an officer of rank &s;ent to him; and a variety of rea&s;ons concurred to induce me to believe that you would an&s;wer the important objects I had in view, as well at lea&s;t as any I could choo&s;e. I have not been di&s;appointed in the lea&s;t in my expecta|tion, and the Count him&s;elf judges your continuing very e&s;&s;ential, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following man|ner upon the &s;ubject &s;everal days ago. <HI>"I &s;hall keep with me, if you think proper, Gen. Heath, who&s;e ardour, &s;pirit, and activity, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to me."</HI> For the&s;e &s;everal con&s;iderations, I wi&s;h you to reconcile your&s;elf to remaining with him a while, which will be the more ea&s;y, when you con&s;ider that you will be fully adverti&s;ed whenever we are in a &s;ituation to attempt any thing offen&s;ive on a great &s;cale, and will have your command."</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h &s;hip of war, the Galetea, appeared off Dartmouth. The Briti&s;h fleet went to Gardner's Bay, excepting the frigates, which cruized off. The troops continued fortifying the i&s;land.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h fleet &s;ailed from Gardner's Bay to the ea&s;tward. About this time, Maj. Gen. Greene re&s;igned the Quarter-Ma&s;ter General&s;hip, and Col. Pickering was appointed to that office.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;In the afternoon, the Briti&s;h again appeared off the harbour of Newport. A few days before, the Continental frigate Alliance arrived at Bo&s;ton, in five weeks and four days from France, and brought news that there had been a great mob in England, headed by Lord George Gordon, and that the pri&s;|ons, &amp;c. had been pulled down.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="251">
23d.&mdash;The privateer &s;hip Wa&s;hington, Capt. Tal|bot, of 20 guns, came down the river, &s;aluted the Commodore, and came to anchor.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The French army, joined by the Ameri|cans, fired &s;alutes on account of its being St. Louis' day. The fleet fired on the next day.</P>
<P>The enemy were preparing for an embarkation of troops at New-York; their de&s;tination unknown.</P>
<P>The evening of the 20th, three or four of the enemy's cruizers were off the harbour.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h fleet, to the number of more than 20 &s;ail, were in the Vineyard Sound.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;A number of Indians from the northwe&s;t|ern tribes came to Newport to pay their re&s;pects to the General of the army of their father the King of France. They had a hearty welcome, a treat, and pre&s;ents, and were much plea&s;ed. They were al&s;o invited by our General to a &s;umptuous treat. After dinner, they performed their war dance before the officers of the armies, to the great &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e of the French, who had not &s;een the like before. The next day, the French troops were under arms, manoeuvred, and fired, in pre&s;ence of the Indians, who were much plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Information was received that Admiral Arbuthnot was near the Vineyard with nine &s;ail of the line, eight other &s;hips of war of different force, and two tenders; that he had made a demand of 11,000 lb. of beef and mutton, to be delivered every other day, at five pence per lb. The inhabitants remon&s;trating again&s;t furni&s;hing &s;o large a quantity, the Admiral a&s;&s;ured them that in ca&s;e they volunta|rily delivered as much as their ability would allow, he would di&s;pen&s;e with what might be wanting.</P>
<P>The enemy continued their preparations for &s;ome grand enterpri&s;e, which could not be developed.</P>

<P>11th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that on the 16th ult. Major-General Gates was totally defeated by the Briti&s;h, at or near Camden, in South-Caroli|na. The Maryland line &s;uffered greatly, and Maj. Gen. Baron de Calb was wounded, of which wounds he died.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Brig. Gen. Poor, of New-Hamp&s;hire, died at camp on the 8th, of a putrid fever; and that Brig. Gen. Nixon had re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was holding a body of troops, &s;aid to be about 6,000, in readine&s;s to embark at New-York, &s;aid to be de&s;|tined to the &s;outhward. The 17th, in the morning, the Continental regiment, commanded by Colonel Greene, cro&s;&s;ed over from the i&s;land to Greenwich, from whence they were to march to the main army.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received that Admiral Rodney arrived at Sandy Hook on the 13th, with ten &s;ail of the line, and two frigates&mdash;that on the 15th, Commodore Drake, with four &s;ail of the line, was detached from the Hook to join Admiral Ar|buthnot near Gardner's I&s;land, and that the&s;e four &s;hips joined on the 18th. This junction was intended to intercept 12 &s;ail of French men-of-war, which were expected to be coming from the We&s;t-Indies to Rhode-I&s;land&mdash;that the 76th and 80th Briti&s;h regiments, one He&s;&s;ian regiment, the Queen's Ran|gers, Fanning's corps, a part of the hor&s;e, and all the Briti&s;h grenadiers and light-infantry, were or|dered to embark immediately at New-York&mdash;it was conjectured for Virginia. The di&s;po&s;ition of the Briti&s;h troops at that time was &s;aid to be as follows: the 22d, 76th Briti&s;h, 3 He&s;&s;ian regiments, Robin|&s;on's corps, and &s;ome artillery in the city&mdash;Highland

emigrants, at Brooklyn&mdash;a few invalids at Newton&mdash;one regiment of He&s;&s;ians at Jamaica&mdash;the 37th, 38th and 43d Briti&s;h, one He&s;&s;ian regiment, one yauger, one grenadier, and one light-infantry from Jamaica to Flu&s;hing&mdash;about three regiments at White&s;tone&mdash;Queen's Rangers, Oy&s;ter Bay&mdash;Fanning's regiment, the 3d regiment of Delaney's, and the Jer&s;ey volun|teers, Lloyd's Neck&mdash;Col.

<P>22d.&mdash;Col. Greene's regiment was ordered to re|turn from Greenwich to the i&s;land. The French army continued very bu&s;y in fortifying Rhode-I&s;land: &s;ome of their works were exceedingly &s;trong, and mounted with heavy metal.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things, I think it nece&s;|&s;ary that you &s;hould join the army; and reque&s;t that
<PB N="254" REF="254">
you will do it. You will come to head-quarters your&s;elf. The route through Litchfield will be the mo&s;t eligible for you, on account of &s;ecurity; and you may direct your baggage to halt at Fi&s;h-Kill, for your further orders. I write to the Count de Ro|chambeau by this conveyance; and I tru&s;t that your coming away now, will not be attended with any material inconvenience to him.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without informing you of an event which has happened here, which will &s;trike you with a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation:&mdash;Maj. Gen. Arnold has gone to the enemy. He had had an interview with Major Andre, Adjutant-General of the Briti&s;h army, and had put into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;tate of the army of the garri&s;on at this po&s;t, of the number of men con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary for the de|fence of it; a return of the ordnance, and the di&s;po|&s;ition of the artillery corps, in ca&s;e of an alarm. By a mo&s;t providential interpo&s;ition, Major Andre was taken in returning to New-York, with all the&s;e pa|pers in Gen. Arnold's hand-writing; who, hearing of the matter, kept it to him&s;elf, left his quarters immediately, under pretext of going over to We&s;t Point, on Monday forenoon, about an hour before my arrival; then pu&s;hed down the river in the barge, which was not di&s;covered till I had returned from We&s;t-Point in the afternoon, and when I received the fir&s;t information of Mr. Andre's capture. Mea&s;|ures were in&s;tantly taken to apprehend him; but, before the officers &s;ent for the purpo&s;e could reach Verplank's Point, he had pa&s;&s;ed it with a flag, and got on board the Vulture &s;hip of war, which lay a few miles below. He knew of my approach, and that I was vi&s;iting, with the Marquis, the north and middle redoubts; and from this circum&s;tance, was &s;o &s;traitened in point of time, that I believe he carried with him but very few, if any, material papers;
<PB N="255" REF="255">
though he has a very preci&s;e knowledge of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the po&s;t. The gentlemen of Gen. Arnold's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, were not privy in the lea&s;t degree to the mea&s;ure he was carrying on, or to his e&s;cape.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Gen. Arnold's panic was &s;o great, when he found that the plot was di&s;covered, that he called out for a <HI>hor&s;e,</HI> any hor&s;e that fir&s;t came to hand, if it were a waggon-hor&s;e; upon the hor&s;e's being brought, the General mounted, and, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing to the landing by the u&s;ual path, he rode down a &s;teep bank, where it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible for a hor&s;e with a rider to get down, without being unhor&s;ed.</P>
<P>When Arnold had pa&s;&s;ed Verplank's Point, and had got under the guns of the Vulture, he told Cor|poral Larvey, who was Cock&s;wain of the barge, that he was going on board the &s;hip, and that he &s;hould not return; that if he (Larvey) would &s;tay with him, he &s;hould have a commi&s;&s;ion in the Briti&s;h &s;er|vice. To this, Larvey, who was a &s;mart fellow, re|plied, that he would be d&mdash;d if he fought on both &s;ides; the General replied, that he would &s;end him on &s;hore. Arnold then told the barge crew, that if any or all of them would &s;tay with him, they &s;hould be treated well; but if they declined &s;taying, they &s;hould be &s;ent on &s;hore. One or two &s;taid, the re&s;t, with the Cock&s;wain, were &s;ent on &s;hore in the &s;hip's boat; the barge was kept. Larvey, for his fidelity, was made a Serjeant. He thought he had merited more; that he ought to have had as much as Arnold promi&s;ed him. He continued un|ea&s;y, until at his repeated reque&s;t he was allowed to leave the army.</P>
<P>Maj. Andre, on his return towards New-York, fell in with three young men below the lines, John Paulding, David Williams, and I&s;aac Van Vert; they
<PB N="256" REF="256">
did not at fir&s;t know that Andre was a Briti&s;h officer, and he was at a lo&s;s whether they were Briti&s;h, ref|ugees, or &s;taunch Americans. There was con&s;e|quently a little fine&s;&s;e exhibited on both &s;ides; but at length it was fully di&s;covered who Andre was. He then attempted to bribe the young men, by of|fering them a large &s;um of money; but their fidel|ity was too great to be purcha&s;ed. They brought him up, and delivered him to the Americans, where he was tried, &s;entenced, and hanged as a &s;py. The Briti&s;h General on the river endeavoured to &s;ave his life, fir&s;t by threats, and then by per&s;ua&s;ions; but all was in vain. Maj. Andre's behaviour, until the time of his execution, was becoming an officer and a gentleman; and &s;uch, in his la&s;t moments, as drew tears from many eyes. But it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that he who con&s;ents to become a &s;py, when he &s;ets out, has by allu&s;ion a halter put round his neck, and that by the u&s;age of armies, if he be tak|en, the other end of the halter is &s;peedily made fa&s;t to a gallows.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, plea&s;ed with the conduct of John Paul|ding, David Williams, and I&s;aac Van Vert, pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution, on the 4th of October, directing that 200 dollars, in &s;pecie, &s;hould be annually paid to them, during life; and that a &s;ilver medal, de&s;crip|tive of their fidelity, with the thanks of Congre&s;s, &s;hould be pre&s;ented to each of them.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h army, and other cir|cum&s;tances, at the moment Andre was detected, were &s;uch as render it highly probable, that if he had not been taken, the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences to the American cau&s;e would very &s;oon have taken place.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;The next day after our General received the letter from Gen. Wa&s;hington, he took a mo&s;t affectionate leave of the French officers, and
<PB N="257" REF="257">
left Newport, to prepare to go on to the army. His waggon-hor&s;es were out in the country at a di&s;tance; the&s;e were to be brought in, &s;hod, &amp;c. and other preparations to be made, which prevented his leaving Providence until the afternoon of the 9th, when he was attended out of town by a number of officers and other gentlemen. Before he left Providence, he bid Count Rochambeau another farewel, by let|ter, to which an an&s;wer was forwarded on after him, as follows:</P>

<P>IN my letter of the 26th ult. by which I re|que&s;ted you to rejoin the army, I de&s;ired that you would come your&s;elf to head-quarters: I am now to reque&s;t that you will proceed to We&s;t-Point, and take upon you the command of that po&s;t and its de|pendencies.

<P>Our General had &s;carcely entered on the com|mand, before he received intelligence that the ene|my were making an incur&s;ion upon the northern frontier of New-York; upon which he immediately, without con&s;ulting the Commander in Chief, order|ed Col. Gan&s;evoort's regiment to their relief, and communicated what he had done to head-quarters; to which he received the following an&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>HEAD-QUARTERS, PREKANESS, <DATE><HI>16th Oct.</HI> 1780.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favoured with your's of ye&s;terday, ac|companied by a letter from his Excellency Governor Clinton, who gives me an account of the incur&s;ion upon the frontiers. I am happy that you detached Gan&s;evoort's regiment immediately; you will be plea&s;ed to order either Wei&s;enfeld's or Willet's, as you may judge proper, to follow, and take orders from the Governor or the commanding officer. This is all the force I think we ought to detach from the po&s;ts, until the views of the enemy are more fully a&s;certained. They put off the long expected em|barkation &s;trangely. They had not &s;ailed the 13th. and it was then &s;aid the expedition was delayed for &s;ome purpo&s;e. The number under orders, by e&s;ti|mate, are about 2,000, or &s;omething upwards. If the militia &s;hould not have been di&s;charged, when this reaches you, you will be plea&s;ed to detain about
<PB N="259" REF="259">
500, to make up for the detachment you have &s;ent up the river. I have received your's of the 13th, as I have done that inclo&s;ing the e&s;timates, for which I am much obliged. You will be plea&s;ed to carry in|to execution what you propo&s;ed, re&s;pecting the po&s;ts at Stoney and Verplank's Points.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This was followed by another, dated the 18th, in which the Commander in Chief ob&s;erved, "I am glad to find, by your letter of the 17th, that you were arrived at We&s;t-Point, and had taken the com|mand of that important po&s;t." This was occa&s;ioned by our General's having been on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river a day or two, until the quarters on the point were quitted by Maj. Gen. Greene, who was order|ed to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>On the 17th, intelligence was received, that the enemy had advanced to Fort George and Fort Ann, both of which had fallen into their hands; that af|ter de&s;troying the works, and burning about thirty hou&s;es, and as many barns, they had gone back; but it was apprehended that they would advance again.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Greene left We&s;t-Point. The &s;ame day intelligence was received, that on the 16th the long talked of embarkation of troops &s;ailed from New-York, &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;tined to the &s;outh|ward. The American troops at this time drove up the fat cattle which were near the lines, in con&s;e|quence of a warrant from Gov. Clinton.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the enemy were meditating an excur&s;ion as far up as Crom|pond and its vicinity, to &s;weep off all the cattle. Our General immediately ordered Col. Hazen, with a detachment of 500 men, to move to Pine's Bridge, and Lieut. Col. Jame&s;on, with the 2d light dragoons, to move from Bedford towards Col. Hazen. The
<PB N="260" REF="260">
detachment arrived at Pine's Bridge about 10 o'clock the &s;ame evening, and Col. Jame&s;on with the dra|goons at about 2 o'clock the next morning. The evening of the 23d, Col. Hazen returned with the detachment; the enemy did nor come out.</P>
<P>About this time, the enemy received a &s;mall rein|forcement at New-York, from England, &s;aid to be 1,500 or 2,000. Two or three very valuable prizes, laden with rum, &s;ugar, &amp;c. were &s;ent into Philadel|phia, and news was received that upwards of 50 &s;ail of Briti&s;h Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indiamen, outward bound, were taken by the combined fleets of France and Spain, near Cape Fini&s;ter.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the enemy had laid wa&s;te a great part of the fertile country above Saratoga, and to the we&s;tward of Schenectady. The &s;ame night, 20 pri&s;oners made their e&s;cape from the provo&s;t at Fi&s;h-Kill, by digging upwards of 20 feet under ground; parties were &s;ent out after them in different directions, and &s;ome of them were re|taken.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;News was received, that the militia, under Gen. Van Ren&s;&s;elaer, obtained a con&s;iderable ad|vantage over the enemy at the northward, on the 19th in&s;tant, at the Fox Mills. The action la&s;ted for &s;ome hours; the enemy left their baggage, pri&s;|oners, &amp;c. Col. Brown was killed in &s;kirmi&s;hing with the enemy on the morning of the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Official intelligence was received of a &s;ig|nal advantage gained by the Americans in North-Carolina over a corps of fourteen hundred men, Brit|i&s;h troops, and new levies, commanded by Col. Fer|gu&s;on. The militia of the neighbouring country under Colonels Williams and Shelby, and others having a&s;&s;embled to the number of 3,000, detached 1,600 men on hor&s;eback, to fall in with Fergu&s;on's party on its march to Charlotte&mdash;they came up with
<PB N="261" REF="261">
them at a place called King's Mountain, advantage|ou&s;ly po&s;ted, and gave them a total defeat, in which Col. Fergu&s;on, with 150 of his men were killed, 800 made pri&s;oners, and 1,500 &s;tands of arms taken, with but incon&s;iderable lo&s;s, except, and greatly to be regretted, the brave Col. Williams, who was &s;up|po&s;ed to be mortally wounded. A &s;econd account &s;tated the enemy's whole lo&s;s in killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, at 1,105; and that of the Americans in killed and wounded, 64.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Brig. Gen. James Clinton was ordered to Albany, to take the command in that quarter.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Capt. John&s;on, with a detachment con&s;i&s;ting of 100 men, marched to do duty on the lines for the protection of the inhabitants again&s;t the enemy, and the cow-boys, (&s;o called) a &s;et of plundering thieves.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;A ridiculous proclamation of the traitor Arnold, made its appearance; he &s;tyled him&s;elf a Brigadier-General, and invited the officers and &s;ol|diers of the American army to join him, promi&s;ing ample encouragement, &amp;c. but it had no effect.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;A &s;evere &s;torm of &s;now and rain. The brave &s;oldiers who were but illy clad, and de&s;ti|tute of blankets, were in a &s;hivering condition.</P>
<P>The deva&s;tation committed by the enemy at the northward, was found to be very great; at lea&s;t 200 dwellings and 150,000 bu&s;hels of wheat, with a pro|portion of other grain and forage, were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been de&s;troyed; had not the pur&s;uit after the enemy been very rapid, the deva&s;tations would have been much greater.</P>
<P>The American army were at this time experi|encing a great want of flour, which they bore with their u&s;ual patience.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Maj. Carle|ton, after being reinforced with 500 men, was re|turning towards Skeen&s;borough; it was &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="262" REF="262">
that his force had increa&s;ed to about 1,600, and fur|ther depredations on the frontiers were expected. The militia of the upper counties were again ordered out by Gov. Clinton.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the new arrangement of the army was publi&s;hed. The encouragement to both officers and &s;oldiers was generous.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;The troops were again without bread. In|telligence was received that the enemy had landed a body of troops at Port&s;mouth, in Virginia, and that another embarkation was talked of at New-York.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;News was received from Bo&s;ton, that his Excellency John Hancock had been cho&s;en Govern|or of the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts&mdash;the fir&s;t Governor under the new con&s;titution. The &s;ame day, intel|ligence was received from the northward, that the enemy had cro&s;&s;ed Lake George the Thur&s;day before, and advanced to Fort Edward, the &s;mall garri&s;on of which abandoned the fort on the approach of the enemy, who&s;e numbers were &s;aid to be about 800. The militia were out, and the 1&s;t and 5th New-York regiments were ordered to embark and &s;ail for Al|bany immediately. They &s;ailed early on the morn|ing of the 9th. On the &s;ame day, intelligence was received, that the enemy had lately made an excur|&s;ion to the upper parts of Connecticut river, and de|&s;troyed a number of hou&s;es at Royalton. The mi|litia turned out with &s;pirit, repul&s;ed and pur&s;ued them; the enemy made off with precipitation, leav|ing their plunder, &amp;c. behind them. Upwards of 2,000 militia were a&s;&s;embled in that quarter.</P>
<P>The 2d regiment of dragoons moved from Bed|ford to North-Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The enemy publi&s;hed &s;everal letters in the New-York papers, which were taken from the Fi&s;h-Kill po&s;t-rider not long before at Stratford; in particu|lar,
<PB N="263" REF="263">
one from the general officers belonging to the New-England States to their &s;everal Legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>A partial but not general exchange of pri&s;oners took place about this time. Maj. Gen. Lincoln was exchanged for Maj. Gen. Phillips; General Thomp&s;on, and a number of American officers, who had long been pri&s;oners, were al&s;o exchanged.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The great chain, which was laid acro&s;s the Hud&s;on at We&s;t-Point, was taken up for the winter; it was done under the direction of Colonel Govion, Capt. Buchanan, and Capt. Nevers, with a &s;trong detachment of the garri&s;on, and with &s;kill and dexterity. This chain was as long as the width of the river between We&s;t-Point and Con&s;titution I&s;land, where it was fixed to great blocks on each &s;ide, and under the fire of batteries on both &s;ides of the river. The links of this chain were probably 12 inches wide, and 18 inches long; the iron about 2 inches &s;quare. This heavy chain was buoyed up by very large logs of perhaps 16 or more feet long, a little pointed at the ends, to le&s;&s;en their oppo&s;ition to the force of the water on flood and ebb. The logs were placed at &s;hort di&s;tances from each other, the chain carried over them, and made fa&s;t to each by &s;taples, to prevent their &s;hifting; and there were a number of anchors dropped at di&s;tances, with ca|bles made fa&s;t to the chain, to give it a greater &s;tability. The &s;hort bend of the river at this place was much in favour of the chain's proving effectual; for a ve&s;&s;el, coming up the river with the faire&s;t wind and &s;tronge&s;t way, mu&s;t lo&s;e them on chang|ing her cour&s;e to turn the point; and before &s;he could get under any con&s;iderable way again, even if the wind was fair, &s;he would be on the chain, and at the &s;ame time under a heavy &s;hower of &s;hot and &s;hells.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="264">
15th.&mdash;The 1&s;t and 5th New-York regiments returned from Albany, the enemy having returned to Canada, except about 400 men, chiefly Briti&s;h, who were encamped about 10 miles below Crown-Point. Provi&s;ions were extremely &s;carce at Albany.</P>
<P>The night of the 16th, a number of the boats were &s;tove by the violence of the wind and &s;torm.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 18th, five large &s;lat-bot|tomed boats, under the charge of a Subaltern and 25 picked watermen, were &s;ent down the river to the &s;lote above Dobb's-Ferry, where they were to be placed on carriages, and tran&s;ported to a certain place, for an enterpri&s;e which was meditating again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Five companies, of 50 men each, marched from We&s;t-Point, for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ing teams in the upper part of We&s;tche&s;ter, and lower parts of Dutche&s;s Counties, preparatory to the grand forage.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the invalids of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut lines, and a detachment of able bodied men, the whole about 1000, arrived at We&s;t-Point, from the main army.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Three light field-pieces, with four ammu|nition tumbrels, with ammunition for the artillery, and mu&s;quet-cartridges; and al&s;o a quantity of hard bread, rum, &amp;c. was &s;ent down to Peek's-Kill, for the u&s;e of the grand foragers.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;The troops de&s;tined for the grand forage paraded between Nel&s;on's Point and the church. Ju&s;t before they marched, Chevalier Cha&s;tellux, Major General in the French army, at Newport, and &s;ome other French officers, arrived; the detachment de|filed before them, and proceeded for the lines. The French officers were much plea&s;ed with the appear|ance of the troops.</P>
<P>Gen. Cha&s;tellux then accompanied our General over to the Point, and on landing was &s;aluted by the
<PB N="265" REF="265">
di&s;charge of 13 cannon; after dinner, he took a view of Forts Clinton, Putnam, Willis, &amp;c. At eve|ning Count Noailles, Count Damas, and Maj. Du|pli&s;&s;is, arrived at the Point. The next morning, a|bout 9 o'clock, Gen. Cha&s;tellux, and the other French officers, amid&s;t a &s;evere cold &s;torm of rain, embarked on board the barge, and went down the river, to King's Ferry, on their way to head-quar|ters; on leaving We&s;t-Point, they were again &s;alut|ed by 13 cannon.</P>
<P>The evening of the 22d, Brig. Gen. Starks arri|ved at Wright's Mills, and the waggons were col|lected at North-Ca&s;tle. This grand forage was to ma&s;k an enterprize, which was to have been at|tempted by Gen. Wa&s;hington, from the main army; although the foraging was in it&s;elf an important object. The enterprize, for &s;ome rea&s;ons, was not at|tempted, but the grand forage was very &s;ucce&s;sful. Some of the light troops went as low down as Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter; and on the 27th, Gen. Starks returned with a large quantity of corn, &s;ome hay, cattle, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next day, the main army &s;eparated to move into winter-quarters, and the light-infantry corps was broken up for the winter, and the men ordered to join their re&s;pective regiments. The corps of light-infanty was perhaps as fine a body of men as was ever formed. Major-General the Marquis de la Fayette had, with infinite pains and great expen&s;e, endeavoured to render them re&s;pectable in their ap|pearance as well as di&s;cipline, in which he was no|bly &s;econded by the officers: it was a pity that the operations of the campaign did not afford an oppor|tunity for the Marquis to &s;ignalize him&s;elf with this corps.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;The New-Jer&s;ey brigade left We&s;t-Point, proceeding down on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, on their way to Pompton, where they took winter-quar|ters.
<PB N="266" REF="266">
In the afternoon, the four Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brig|ades arrived at We&s;t-Point, and the two Connecti|cut brigades on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, where the whole took winter-quarters.</P>
<P>A few days before, viz. on the 23d, Maj. Talmadge, with a detachment from the 2d regiment of dragoons, conducted with great addre&s;s an enterprize again&s;t the enemy's Fort, St. George, on Long-I&s;land. Fort St. George was &s;tockaded, and encompa&s;&s;ed a large &s;pot of ground, a &s;quare redoubt, with a ditch and abbatis. The enterprize &s;ucceeded completely. One half-pay Lieutenant-Colonel, 1 half-pay Captain, 1 Subaltern, and 50 rank and file, were made pri&s;oners. The fort was de&s;troyed and burnt. Two armed ve&s;|&s;els burnt, and a large magazine of hay, &s;aid to be about 300 tons, was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;One of the large&s;t &s;cows at King's Ferry, in cro&s;&s;ing, with &s;everal baggage waggons on board, &s;unk.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, our General began to di&s;charge the &s;ix-months men, beginning with tho&s;e who were the wor&s;t cloathed and unfit for duty.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;The three New-York regiments &s;ailed for Albany, where they were to take winter-quarters.</P>

<P>On the evening of the 9th, Gen. Varnum and Col. Pickering, arrived at We&s;t-Point; at this time the troops were without bread, and very unea&s;y. The next day, 300 barrels of flour arrived. A little before noon, Gen. Wa&s;hington vi&s;ited We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="267">
12th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from New-York, that another embarkation was to take place, and that Gen. Phillips and Gen. Arnold were to command. Major Talmadge received the thanks of Congre&s;s for his good conduct in taking Fort St. George.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;An expre&s;s from Major Maxwell on the lines, brought up intelligence that the enemy at Mor|ri&s;&s;ania, under Col. Delancy, were preparing for an enterprize. The Major was cautioned to be on his guard.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;News was received that Mon&s;ieur de Sar|tine, the primate of France, had been removed&mdash;Mr. D'Ca&s;tries appointed.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;News was received that the Hon. Henry Laurens, who was &s;ent on a mi&s;&s;ion to Holland, had been taken by the Briti&s;h, carried into England, and clo&s;ely confined. The Briti&s;h government talked of &s;ending to America a large reinforcement for the next campaign.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Further intelligence having been received that Col. Delancy intended to vi&s;it our troops on the lines, in order to give him a proper reception, 150 men were ordered from the New-Hamp&s;hire line, to march to Crom-Pond.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received that on the pre|ceding Friday, the tran&s;ports which had taken the troops on board at New-York, fell down to the watering place. They were to be convoyed by one 50 gun &s;hip and two frigates.</P>
<P>On the night of the 9th, Major Hugerford, of Delancy's corps, &s;urpri&s;ed and took pri&s;oners Lieut. Col. Wells, of a Connecticut State regiment, who was &s;tationed near Hor&s;eneck, with one Captain, two Lieutenants, two En&s;igns, and upwards of twenty privates.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Intelligence was received that Mon&s;ieur, the Chevalier de Ternay, Admiral of the French &s;quad|ron at Newport, had died there.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="268">
The troops on the lines were reinforced with 50 men, and Lieut. Col. Hull was appointed to the com|mand on the lines.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The Free and Accepted Ma&s;ons of Wa&s;h|ington Lodge celebrated the fea&s;t of St. John, at Starkean Hall, on We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington vi&s;ited the Point, and, with a number of other officers, dined with our General.</P>
<P>On the 25th in&s;t. Major Humphries, Aid-de-camp to the Commander in Chief, went towards New-York on an enterprize; he was attended by Capt. Welles, of the Connecticut line, Lieut. Hart, En&s;ign M'Cal|pin, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. M'Guyer, and twenty-four non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates, in one barge and two whale-boats. The wind was very fre&s;h at north-we&s;t in the night, and the boats were forced pa&s;t the city, and one of them almo&s;t down to Sandy-Hook&mdash;one of the boats put in at Staten I&s;land: at length the three went round to Brun&s;wick, from whence the Major and all the others, returned to the army on the 1&s;t of January.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;On the evening of the 29th, a party of the enemy from Delancy's corps, con&s;i&s;ting of about 100 infantry and 50 hor&s;e, came up to North-Ca&s;tle, where, after a &s;hort halt, they proceeded towards Bedford New Purcha&s;e. Capt. Pritchard, who was po&s;ted at Bedford with a company of continental troops, and &s;ome militia, immediately advanced to|wards them, attacked their van, who retreated, as did their main body. Capt. Pritchard pur&s;ued them as far as Young's. It was &s;aid that one of the en|emy was killed and &s;everal wounded, who were car|ried off in a waggon. Four oxen and between 30 and 40 &s;heep were retaken&mdash;eight or ten head of cattle were driven off: the Captain &s;u&s;tained no in|jury.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="269">
This day the enemy were out again: Col. Hull immediately marched down with his whole force to meet them; by his vigilance they were prevented from doing any mi&s;chief, and on his advance, retired towards the &s;aw-pits.</P>
<P>1781. <HI>January</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;The Penn&s;ylvania line mu|tinied almo&s;t to a man, &s;eized the artillery, broke op|en the magazines of ammunition and provi&s;ions, took out what they judged nece&s;&s;ary, and took up their line of march. The officers exerted them&s;elves, both by threats and per&s;ua&s;ion, to reduce them to order; but all was in vain. They were told that the enemy might take the advantage of their conduct, and come out&mdash;they an&s;wered, that if the enemy came out, they would immediately put them&s;elves under the com|mand of their office, and fight them; but that in any other ca&s;e they would not be commanded. They took Gen. Wayne's hor&s;es out of his &s;table, and put them to draw the field-pieces. At night they en|camped, po&s;ting out pickets, guards, and planting centinels in a very regular manner. An alarm was given to the country by firing the beacons, &amp;c. and the militia were a&s;&s;embling. The rea&s;ons given for the revolt, were the intolerable &s;ufferings of the ar|my&mdash;the want of pay, of which 11 months was due&mdash;the want of cloathing, many of the troops being almo&s;t naked&mdash;the want of provi&s;ions, and that ma|ny of them were held beyond the term of their en|li&s;tment. They directed their march towards Phi|ladelphia, determined to demand redre&s;s of their grievances of Congre&s;s.</P>

<P>11th.&mdash;His Excellency the Commander in Chief came down to We&s;t-Point, when a Council of War was held at our General's quarters, in which all the General Officers on the ground, and all the Colonels and commanding officers of regiments &s;at, to con&s;id|er what mea&s;ures were nece&s;&s;ary to be adopted, with re&s;pect to the Penn&s;ylvania line. After the Council, by order of the Commander in Chief, our General i&s;&s;ued orders for the forming of five battalions, by detachment from the &s;everal lines, to be held in the mo&s;t perfect readine&s;s to march on the &s;horte&s;t no|tice, with four days provi&s;ions cooked. The muti|neers remained on the heights of Princetown, and two emi&s;&s;aries were &s;ent out to them from the ene|my, with offers, in writing, promi&s;ing to redre&s;s their grievances, by di&s;charging them from their enli&s;t|ments, paying all their arrearages of pay and depre|ciation, and exempting them from &s;erving in the Brit|i&s;h army, if they &s;hould choo&s;e it. The mutineers no|bly di&s;dained the&s;e offers, and gave up the emi&s;&s;a|ries and their papers: they were tried, and hanged as &s;pies; the one was an inhabitant of New-Jer&s;ey, the other was a Briti&s;h Serjeant. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton and Gen. Knyphau&s;en were &s;aid to have been on Staten I&s;land. The State appointed a Com|mittee to inquire into the grounds of the complaints of the mutineers, and to redre&s;s &s;uch as appeared to have foundation: this brought the bu&s;ine&s;s to a clo&s;e. A number of the &s;oldiers were di&s;charged, the re&s;t returned to their duty.</P>
<P>Accounts were received from the &s;outhward, that the American army in that quarter were in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition, on account of cloathing and provi&s;ions, and that their &s;ufferings were greater than tho&s;e experienced by the main army. The&s;e &s;uffer|ings
<PB N="271" REF="271">
of the army were rendered the keener, by the return of the officers and &s;oldiers from furlough, who had been in the great &s;ea-port towns, where ev|ery nece&s;&s;ary and luxury of life were enjoyed, in the greate&s;t abundance, many tables groaning under the pre&s;&s;ure of the dainties with which they were cover|ed. Their liquors were not only the be&s;t, but al&s;o of great variety. Such reports to men, &s;tanding cen|tinel, as it were, in the jaws of death, ill clad, cold and hungry, with nothing but water oftentimes to drink, were trials almo&s;t too great for human nature to bear. The old Continental currency was fixed at 75 for one, at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;The Marquis de la Fayette and Count Deuxponts vi&s;ited We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the troops which &s;ome time before &s;ailed from New-York, were in the Che&s;apeak, under the command of Gen. Ar|nold, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be on a plundering expedition.</P>
<P>The enemy at New-York removed the greater part of their &s;hipping from the Ea&s;t River round in|to the North River.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Two hundred men, properly officered, marched down to the lines, under pretence of being a relief; 100 men of Hazen's regiment moved from Fi&s;hkill, to the village, and a detachment of artille|ty from We&s;t-Point. The&s;e were intended for an enterprize again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;150 men from the Connecticut line, and 200 from the New-Hamp&s;hire line, were to move towards the lines; the&s;e, with tho&s;e who marched from Hazen's the day before, were to form a cover|ing party to the detachment under Lieut. Col. Hull, who was to make an attempt on Delancy's corps.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A letter was received from Major Throop, at Ringwood, &s;tating, that the evening before, the Jer&s;ey line, at Pompton, had revolted, and it was &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="272" REF="272">
would be joined by the other part of the line, who were at Chatham. Their intentions had not been developed.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;His Excellency Gen. Wa&s;hington, the Marquis de la Fayette, and a number of French gentlemen, vi&s;ited the Point. The &s;ame day, 500 rank and file, properly officered from the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, Connecticut, and New-Hamp&s;hire lines, were detached, and ordered to march the next day, un|der the command of Maj. Gen. Howe, to e&s;tabli&s;h order and di&s;cipline in the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;The detachment marched from We&s;t-Point for the Jer&s;ies. The battalion from thence was commanded by Col. Sprout. The troops on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river were to cro&s;s, and join tho&s;e from the Point, at King's-Ferry: the detachment marched in high &s;pirits.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;In the morning, about &s;un-ri&s;e, a noi&s;e was heard in the air, re&s;embling the firing of platoons, and there were various conjectures re&s;pecting it. Intelligence was received, that Gen. Arnold had gone up James River, in Virginia, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of William&s;burg, and was moving towards Richmond; that he met with but little oppo&s;ition, and would probably plunder large quantities of to|bacco and other articles.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The detachment, under the command of Lieut. Col. Hull, returned from the enterprize again&s;t the enemy at Morri&s;&s;ania. The addre&s;s and gallant|ry of the officers, the bravery and patience of the troops, exhibited on the occa&s;ion, did them much honour. Be&s;ides a number of the enemy who were killed, upwards of fifty were made pri&s;oners; the Pontoon Bridge was cut away, the huts and forage were burnt, and a large number of cattle driven up. Of the detachment, one En&s;ign, one drummer, and ten rank and file, were killed; one Captain, one
<PB N="273" REF="273">
Serjeant, and eleven rank and file wounded; &s;ix rank and file were mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Howe returned with the de|tachment from the Jer&s;ies; order was e&s;tabli&s;hed among the troops in that quarter: two of the ring|leaders in the revolt were executed. It was learnt, that con&s;iderable damage was done to the enemy's &s;hipping, at New-York, by the high gu&s;ts of wind, on the night of the 23d. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that a Brit|i&s;h 74 gun &s;hip was di&s;ma&s;ted, off New-London; another &s;truck a reef, and a third went out to &s;ea with one of her ma&s;ts lo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12th.&mdash;The Duke de Lauzun, Count Pher&s;on and Col. Sheldon, of the French army, vi&s;|ited We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the 17th ultimo, an action happened near Pedee, in Carolina, between a body of the enemy, under Lieut. Col. Tarleton, and a body of about 800 Americans, under the command of Gen. Morgan: the enemy were to|tally routed, and pur&s;ued upwards of 20 miles. Of the enemy, 10 officers and 100 rank and file were killed, and 200 wounded; 29 officers and 500 rank and file were taken pri&s;oners, with two field-pieces, 2 &s;tandards, 800 mu&s;kets, 35 waggons, 70 negroes, 100 dragoon-hor&s;es, one travelling-forge, and all their mu&s;ic. The lo&s;s of the Americans was not more than 12 killed, and 60 wounded.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Gen. Warner and Col. A&s;hley, of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, arrived at We&s;t-Point, to di&s;tribute to the &s;oldiers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts line, engaged to &s;erve during the war, 24 dollars, in &s;pecie, each, as a gen|erous gratuity from the State. The mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible &s;oldiers did not applaud this mea&s;ure, as it did not a&s;&s;ure to them the full payment of the wages due to them, while this boon increa&s;ed the burden of debt on the State.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="274">
16th.&mdash;Count de St. Maim, of the French army, vi&s;ited We&s;t-Point. The &s;ame day, orders were i&s;&s;u|ed for augmenting the light companies of all the regiments at We&s;t-Point, and its dependencies, to 50 rank and file, each: they were to rendezvous, the 18th or 19th, at Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The light companies were formed into battalions, in the following order: the eight elde&s;t companies of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts line to form a bat|talion, under the command of Col. Vo&s;e and Maj. Galvan; the two younge&s;t companies of that line, and tho&s;e of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, to form a battalion, under the command of Col. Gamat and Maj. Throop; tho&s;e of the New-Hamp&s;hire line, and Col. Hazen's regiment, and &s;uch others as might be joined to them, to form a battalion. This appoint|ment of officers, was declared to be intended not to affect the general plan of arranging the light-infan|try for the campaign. The preceding morning, the enemy made an excur&s;ion from Morri&s;&s;ania, towards Bedford, took Lieuts. Carpenter, Wright and Pea|cock, and five other inhabitants, pri&s;oners; burnt five hou&s;es, plundered and &s;tript &s;everal other inhab|itants, and returned. They were pur&s;ued by Capt. Pritchard, but could not be overtaken.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;The light companies were in&s;pected. It appeared that Admiral Arbuthnot's &s;quadron were &s;o much damaged, in the &s;torm, on the 23d ult. as to be rendered inferior to the French, in the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;A detachment of artillery was ordered from the park, to join the light-infantry; the whole were to be commanded by the Marquis de la Fayette, and were to march to the &s;outhward. The &s;ame day, &s;ix of our guides, on a reconnoitring party, towards King's Bridge, fell in with a reconnoitring party of Delancy's corps: the guides attacked them, and took five pri&s;oners, all of whom were wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="275">
24th.&mdash;The detachment doing duty on the lines, was reduced to 50 rank and file, properly officered. Capt. Paul Jones, who arrived in the Ariel, at Phil|adelphia on the 17th, in eight weeks from L'Orient, brought a large quantity of powder.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a con&s;ider|able embarkation of troops was taking place at New-York&mdash;the inhabitants and army in &s;ome con&s;ter|nation. It was &s;aid that a fleet of French merchant|men had arrived in the Che&s;apeak; but from ap|pearances, there were good grounds to &s;u&s;pect that there was &s;omething more than merchant &s;hips.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;News was received, that a part of the French &s;quadron, at Newport, had &s;ailed as far as the Che&s;apeak, where they took the Romulus, of 50 guns, and nine privateers and tran&s;ports; four of the latter they de&s;troyed, not having &s;pare men to navigate them; but the remainder, with the Romulus, had &s;afely arrived at Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 2d of March, Gen. Wa&s;h|ington &s;et out from New-Wind&s;or, for Rhode-I&s;l|and. By the la&s;t accounts from the &s;outhward, Lord Cornwallis was advancing rapidly, and Gen. Greene retreating moderately. His Lord&s;hip had de&s;troyed his waggons, and di&s;engaged him&s;elf of incumbrance as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;A Capt. Simmons, of Delancy's corps, was &s;ent up to We&s;t-Point; he a&s;&s;erted to be di&s;affected to the enemy on &s;ome pretences, and that he had re|&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and de&s;erted from them: he was &s;ent to the Governor of the State.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Three pri&s;oners were &s;ent up; they were taken by a party of our guides, within a &s;mall di&s;|tance of the enemy's po&s;t, No. 8, near Morri&s;&s;ania.</P>
<P>6th and 7th.&mdash;Col. Van&s;caak's regiment of the New-York line arrived at We&s;t-Point, from Alba|ny. The troops were at this time well &s;upplied with
<PB N="276" REF="276">
provi&s;ions, but almo&s;t totally de&s;titute of forage, and &s;ubjected to great fatigue in obtaining fuel, which part of the troops were obliged to bring on their backs, nearly a mile.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the la&s;t em|barkation of Briti&s;h troops &s;ailed from New-York the preceding Wedne&s;day, &s;aid to be &s;ix regiments, making about 3,000 men in the whole. The &s;outh|ern militia had been &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Cherokee Indians, and de&s;troyed a number of their towns. The la&s;t advices from the &s;outhward &s;tated, that Lord Cornwallis had continued to pu&s;h rapidly af|ter Gen. Greene, who had cro&s;&s;ed Dan River, and his Lord&s;hip had come up to it, and then began to retreat; on which Gen. Greene re-cro&s;&s;ed the Dan, in order to pur&s;ue him, and that the militia were collecting. Gen. Arnold kept clo&s;e at Port&s;mouth; Gen. Mecklenburgh was near him, with a &s;uperior force, and the Marquis de la Fayette was as far as Elk on the 3d, with the light-infantry.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;A detachment of recruits from Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts arrived. The &s;ame day, Capt. Pray was order|ed to take command of the Block-Hou&s;e, at Dobb's Ferry, the water-guards, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of this month, the Confederation and perpetual Union of the Thirteen American States, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia, inclu&s;ive, was &s;ign|ed and ratified by all the Delegates in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 12th, intelligence was re|ceived from Capt. Pray, that at about two o'clock in the morning, he was alarmed by the firing of guns, blowing of horns, &amp;c.&mdash;that the enemy were out on both &s;ides of the river. In con&s;equence of this, an expre&s;s was &s;ent off to Maj. Maxwell, to be on his guard; and a detachment of 150 men was ordered to be in readine&s;s to march early the next morning, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to cover him.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="277">
13th.&mdash;The intelligence of the enemy being out on both &s;ides of the river, was confirmed; as to the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, the enemy came out from Pau|lus-Hook about 200 &s;trong, with two field-pieces, and had advanced within about three miles of the Block-Hou&s;e, at Dobb's Ferry. About noon, a de|tachment of 150 men, under the command of Maj. Graham, with one field-piece, embarked on board a &s;loop, and with the gun-boat, having one &s;ix and one three pounder, and and a flat boat, fell down the river to King's Ferry, where they were ordered to debark, and make a movement to Tappan, for the relief of the Block-Hou&s;e. The garri&s;ons of the re|doubts, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, were doubled.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;About noon, Maj. Graham returned; he had, with the detachment, embarked the preceding day, proceeded to King's Ferry, di&s;embarked, march|ed to Haver&s;traw, where he met the militia return|ing; when he returned to the Ferry, re-embarked, and arrived at We&s;t-Point about noon; having ex|hibited a &s;pirit and expedition that did the detach|ment much honour.</P>
<P>The enemy were completely defeated in their de|&s;ign, by the militia, who early turned out, attacked, repul&s;ed, and pur&s;ued them, until they retook all their plunder, except two hor&s;es, and ju&s;tly merit|ed high commendation. The militia had one man wounded; the enemy were &s;uppo&s;ed to have had &s;everal killed and wounded. The &s;ame day, Brig. Gen. Hand was announced, in general orders, Ad|jutant-General of the army; in the room of Col. Scammel, who had di&s;charged the duty of that of|fice for &s;ome time, to great acceptation. Col. Scammel joined his regiment.</P>

<P>16th.&mdash;It was learnt that the French fleet, with troops, &s;ailed from Rhode-I&s;land on the 8th; and it was &s;aid that Admiral Arbuthnot, with the Briti&s;h fleet, came out of Gardner's Bay on the 10th. The &s;mall-pox at this time made its appearance in the vicinity of the army, and &s;everal &s;oldiers were taken down with that di&s;temper. The enemy who were out a day or two before, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Hud|&s;on, did no mi&s;chief. About this time, a di&s;covery was made, that a number of per&s;ons at Stratford, Norwalk, &amp;c. had been &s;ecretly a&s;&s;ociating, to &s;ub|mit to the enemy, if a favourable opportunity pre|&s;ented; and to &s;upply them with provi&s;ions, furni&s;h intelligence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Letters from Gen. Greene, of the 28th ult. at Highrockford, on Haw River, advi&s;ed that Lord Cornwallis had retreated from Hill&s;borough, and that Gen. Pickens and Col. Lee had fallen in with Col. Hamilton's corps, (ri&s;ing of 200) and had killed and taken almo&s;t every individual of them; and that &s;everal other &s;kirmi&s;hes had happened, but nothing deci&s;ive. Lord Cornwallis had erected the Royal &s;tandard at Hill&s;borough, and i&s;&s;ued a vain proclamation, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>By accounts from New-York, it appeared that the Briti&s;h had declared war again&s;t the Dutch, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. Eu&s;tatia.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;In the afternoon, Gen. Wa&s;hington arrived at head-quarters, at New-Wind&s;or, from the ea&s;t|ward.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="279">
21&s;t.&mdash;Five pri&s;oners of war were &s;ent to We&s;t-Point, they were taken by &s;ome of the light parties below the lines; a &s;ixth who was taken was &s;o bad|ly wounded, as to be left behind for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Several re&s;olutions of the State of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, in favour of the line of the army, and for the di&s;charge of governmental &s;ecurities, were re|ceived at We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h fleet, which &s;ailed from New-York &s;ome time before, and had been cha&s;ed back by the French fleet, &s;ail|ed again on the preceding Wedne&s;day, for the &s;outh|ward. It was &s;aid that Sir Henry Clinton was on board, and that Gen. Knyphau&s;en was to command in his ab&s;ence&mdash;that the enemy were collecting a number of flat boats in Spitten-Devil Creek, near King&s;bridge, and that 24 were then collected&mdash;that Arnold's corps was under orders to be in readine&s;s to man the boats. Two &s;pies were &s;ent out of New-York, the &s;ame day that the fleet &s;ailed; they were to pa&s;s, by different routes, through the country to Canada.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;A number of pri&s;oners of war, who had been collected at We&s;t-Point, were &s;ent off, under a guard of 60 men, commanded by Capt. Pope, to Lanca&s;ter, in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The New-Hamp&s;hire brigade were ordered to do duty on the lines; and the Rhode-I&s;land regi|ment to return to their quarters near Robin&s;on's Mills.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;News was received from Philadelphia, that the French and Engli&s;h fleets had had an engage|ment off the Capes of Virginia, but that the i&s;&s;ue was not known. The &s;ame day, intelligence was re|ceived from New-York, that one of Admiral Ar|buthnot's &s;hips had returned to New-York, on Mon|day, and reported that there had been an engage|ment
<PB N="280" REF="280">
between the two fleets, and that it was a drawn battle.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;A New-York paper of the 28th was receiv|ed, in which it was &s;aid that an engagement between the two fleets took place on the 16th, off the Capes of Virginia, in which &s;everal &s;hips on both &s;ides re|ceived con&s;iderable damage; and that the Briti&s;h had 1 Lieutenant, 2 mid&s;hipmen, and 40 &s;eamen killed, and 80 wounded. The French account was not greatly different from that of the Briti&s;h, but did not mention the number of killed or wounded.</P>
<P>A number of American &s;oldiers who had not had the mall-pox, were collected and inoculated.</P>
<P><HI>Apri.</HI> 3d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a battle had been fought between Gen. Greene's army and that of Lord Cornwallis. The action was bloody; and although his Lord&s;hip may be &s;aid to have gain|ed the victory, as Gen. Greene retreated a mile from the field of battle, yet it was a dear bought victory. Gen. Greene having lo&s;t his hor&s;es, 4 pieces of can|non fell into the hands of the enemy. Some of the Briti&s;h corps, and in particular the guards, &s;uffered much. This day, Capt. Pray, of the water-guards, was reinforced with a whale-boat, a Subaltern, and 14 men.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington vi&s;ited the Point. In the afternoon, 2 pri&s;oners of war were &s;ent up&mdash;they were of a party who had cro&s;&s;ed Croten River, and taken 16 head of cattle and 4 hor&s;es. On their re|turn, near Dobb's Ferry, they were overtaken by a party of the militia&mdash;the cattle, &amp;c. retaken, and two of the party made pri&s;oners. About this time, the &s;outhern mail was carried off, between head-quar|ters and the Jer&s;ies. The mail contained &s;ome let|ters of importance. The troops which had &s;ailed from New-York, arrived &s;afe in the Che&s;apeak.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="281">
7th.&mdash;Private intelligence was received, that four parties were to be &s;ent out&mdash;one to take Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, another the Governor of New-Jer&s;ey, a third the Governor of New-York, the object of the fourth not known. The &s;ame day, the gun-boat was order|ed to take a &s;tation oppo&s;ite Fort Montgomery; ad|ditional guards to be mounted in the night time, and patroles to pa&s;s frequently.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The enemy's flat boats, which had been col|lected near King&s;bridge, were removed down into the Ea&s;t River.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from the com|manding officer on the lines, that the enemy were out towards White Plains, &s;aid to be about 90 hor&s;e and 50 foot.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;The great chain was hauled from off the beach near the red hou&s;e at We&s;t-Point, and towed down to the blocks, in order to its being laid acro&s;s the river&mdash;about 280 men were ordered on this duty.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;The chain was properly fixed with great dexterity, and fortunately without any accident.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Our General vi&s;ited the patients who were under inoculation with the &s;mall-pox, when 500 were turned out and drawn up, all of whom were then under the operation, and in a fine way. The &s;ame day, intelligence was received that the enemy were preparing for another embarkation at New-York, &s;uppo&s;ed for the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;A groom, belonging to Col. Gunning of the 82d Briti&s;h regiment, came up; he de&s;erted from his ma&s;ter with a very good faddle-hor&s;e, which he &s;old for 100 dollars in &s;pecie. Intelligence was re|ceived that the enemy had brought a large number of waggons acro&s;s the Sound from Long-I&s;land, for the purpo&s;e of making a grand forage; the covering
<PB N="282" REF="282">
party to con&s;i&s;t of three or four hundred men, of different corps.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Two hundred and forty thou&s;and dollars in new emi&s;&s;ion bills were brought to We&s;t-Point, from Bo&s;ton, for the troops of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts line.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Mon&s;ieur Beville, Quarter-Ma&s;ter of the French army at Newport, arrived at head-quarters, New-Wind&s;or; he came on to view the roads, and determine on the be&s;t route, &s;hould the French ar|my move that way, and to fix on proper places for magazines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington vi&s;ited We&s;t-Point, with Mon&s;ieur Beville, &amp;c. The next day, the latter &s;et out on his return to Rhode-I&s;land, taking the lower road through Connecticut. Many of the &s;oldiers, who had gone through the &s;mall-pox, joined their regi|ments the next day: of 500 who had been inoculat|ed, four only had then died. At this time, provi&s;|ions were growing very &s;carce at We&s;t-Point, and the pro&s;pects daily growing more alarming. The magazines in Forts Clinton, Putnam, and &s;ome other of the mo&s;t important works, had re&s;erves of the be&s;t provi&s;ions, which were not to be touched; that, in ca&s;e the enemy, by any &s;udden movement, &s;hould inve&s;t them, and cut off the communication with the country, the garri&s;ons might be enabled to hold out, until other troops, or the militia of the country, could march to the relief of the be&s;ieged; but unfortu|nately, the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions had become &s;o great, that even the&s;e re&s;erves were broken in upon, and &s;ome of them nearly exhau&s;ted; when, after &s;ome other repre&s;entations, our General addre&s;&s;ed the fol|lowing letter to Gen. Wa&s;hington.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DISTRESSED beyond expre&s;&s;ion at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation and future pro&s;pects of the army, with re|gard to provi&s;ions, and convinced with you, that, unle&s;s an immediate and regular &s;upply can be ob|tained, the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences are to be apprehended&mdash;I have determined to make one great

<P>On the next day, our General received the follow|ing letter of in&s;tructions, from the Commander in Chief, viz.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>HEAD-QUARTERS, NEW-WINDSOR, <DATE><HI>May 9th,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be plea&s;ed to proceed immediately to the &s;everal ea&s;tern States, with the di&s;patches ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Governors of Connecticut, Rhode-I&s;l|and, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, and the Pre&s;ident of New-Hamp&s;hire, on the &s;ubject of &s;upplies for the army. The pre&s;ent critical and alarming &s;ituation of our troops and garri&s;ons, for the want of provi&s;ions, is (from the nature of your command) &s;o perfectly known to you, and your per&s;onal influence with the New-England States is &s;o con&s;iderable, that I could not he&s;itate to commit to you a <HI>negociation,</HI> on the &s;ucce&s;s of which, the very exi&s;tence of the army depends.</P>
<P>The great objects of your attention and mi&s;&s;ion, are, 1&s;t&mdash;An immediate &s;upply of beef cattle. 2d&mdash;The tran&s;portation of all the &s;alted provi&s;ions in the
<PB N="285" REF="285">
we&s;tern parts of Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; and 3d&mdash;The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>regular, &s;y&s;tematic, effec|tual plan,</HI> for feeding the army through the cam|paign. Unle&s;s the two former are effected, the gar|ri&s;on of Fort Schuyler mu&s;t inevitably, that of We&s;t-Point may probably, <HI>fall,</HI> and the whole army be di&s;|banded: without the latter, the &s;ame perplexing wants, irregularities and di&s;tre&s;s, which we have &s;o often experienced, will ince&s;&s;antly occur, with event|ual far greater evils, if not final ruin.</P>
<P>With regard to the particular mode of obtaining and tran&s;porting &s;upplies, I will not pre&s;ume to dic|tate; but &s;omething mu&s;t now be attempted on the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion. I would &s;ugge&s;t whether it would not be expedient for a Committee from the &s;everal States, (con&s;i&s;ting of a few active, &s;en&s;ible men) to meet at &s;ome convenient place, in order to make out, upon a uniform and great &s;cale, all the arrangements re&s;pecting &s;upplies and tran&s;portation for the campaign. In the mean time, to avoid the impending di&s;&s;olution of the army, the States mu&s;t individually comply preci&s;ely with the requi&s;itions of the Quarter-Ma&s;ter and Commi&s;&s;ary upon them.</P>
<P>As the &s;alted provi&s;ions which have been put up for the public, in the ea&s;tern States, (except in the we&s;tern parts of Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts) can|not at pre&s;ent be tran&s;ported to the army, you will obtain <HI>accurate official returns</HI> of the quantity that has been procured in the re&s;pective States, at what places, and in who&s;e charge it actually is; and if it &s;hould not all be collected and lodged in the depo&s;its that have been pointed out, you will urge this im|mediately to be done; and that the provi&s;ions &s;hould be repacked, &s;tored, and taken care of in &s;uch a man|ner, as to prevent the hazard of its being tainted or lo&s;t by the approaching hot &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="286">
I omit entering into the detail of particulars, which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate to the re&s;pective Executives, (or Legi&s;latures, if in &s;itting) to enforce the pre&s;ent requi&s;ition, becau&s;e you are as well ac|quainted with the circum&s;tances of our di&s;tre&s;s, the pro&s;pects before us, and the only re&s;ources from whence we can derive relief, as it is po&s;&s;ible for you to be. Previous to your departure, you will obtain from the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General and Commi&s;&s;ary with the army, the proper e&s;timates of &s;upplies and tran&s;portation to be required of the &s;everal States, together with all the light and information concern|ing their department, which may be requi&s;ite to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s committed to you.</P>
<P>After having delivered the di&s;patches with which you are charged, and made &s;uch further repre&s;enta|tions as you may judge nece&s;&s;ary, you will not cea&s;e your applications and importunities, until you are informed officially, whether effectual mea&s;uares are or will be taken, to prevent the army from &s;tarving and di&s;banding. What &s;upplies in general, and particu|larly of <HI>beef cattle,</HI> may certainly be depended upon, to be delivered at fixed regular periods (monthly or weekly) at the army, during the whole campaign. When you &s;hall have &s;een this bu&s;ine&s;s put upon the &s;ure&s;t footing and in the be&s;t train of execution, (which you will endeavour to have effected as early as po&s;&s;ible) you will be plea&s;ed to report to me, with|out delay, the &s;ucce&s;s of your proceedings.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>During the month of April, a large number of re|cruits from the ea&s;tern States, to fill up their re|&s;pective battalions, arrived at We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief vi&s;ited We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;In the morning, our General left We&s;t-Point, and proceeded up the river to New-Wind&s;or, where he received from the Commander in Chief the di&s;patches addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;everal Executives of the New-England States; and in the afternoon cro&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on, on his journey ea&s;tward. On his reaching Fi&s;hkill, he found that Governor Clin|ton, of New-York, was making every exertion in his power for the relief of the army&mdash;that he had i&s;&s;ued impre&s;s warrants, to take flour and other pro|vi&s;ions where they could be found, &amp;c.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;He arrived at Hartford, where he found the Legi&s;lature in &s;e&s;&s;ion. The di&s;patches to Gov|ernor Trumbull were immediately pre&s;ented to him, with an earne&s;t reque&s;t for &s;peedy relief. This venerable patriot gave a&s;&s;urance of his immediate attention and exertions, and accordingly laid the di&s;patches from Gen. Wa&s;hington before the Legi&s;|lature, who al&s;o di&s;covered the &s;ame noble patrioti&s;m. They inquired into the &s;tate of their trea&s;ury, and finding it was de&s;titute of money, except a &s;um ap|propriated to another purpo&s;e, they ordered this money to be taken, and directed Col. Champion, one of their number, (a gentleman remarkable for his knowledge in the &s;tate of provi&s;ions in all the towns, &s;kill in purcha&s;ing, and expedition in for|warding)
<PB N="288" REF="288">
immediately to purcha&s;e and forward on to the army 160 head of beef cattle, and 1,000 bar|rels of &s;alted provi&s;ions from their &s;tores; and re&s;olv|ed to make every other exertion in their power, to comply with the requi&s;itions of the Commander in Chief, as they re&s;pected both fre&s;h and &s;alted provi|&s;ions, by appointing a Committee for a general arrangement of &s;upplies.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Our General left Hartford, and on the 18th reached Greenwich, in the State of Rhode-I&s;land, where he waited upon Gov. Greene, and pre&s;ented the di&s;patches from Gen. Wa&s;hington. The Legi&s;lature of the State were not then in &s;e&s;&s;ion; but Gov. Greene made the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;ur|ances, that the State of Rhode-I&s;land would adopt every mea&s;ure recommended by the Commander in Chief. Our General left Greenwich the &s;ame day, and arrived at his hou&s;e in Roxbury on the evening of the 19th, and the next day waited upon Gov. Hancock at Bo&s;ton, and pre&s;ented the di&s;patches with which he was charged. The new Legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were to convene on the la&s;t Wedne&s;|day of the month. Gov. Hancock gave the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that in the interim the Executive would do every thing in its power for the immediate relief of the army, by directing the &s;everal contractors of provi&s;ions in the State to forward all in their power with the utmo&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Bo&s;ton, that the State &s;hip-of-war, the Protector, of 28 guns, com|manded by Capt. Williams, had been taken and car|ried into New-York.</P>
<P>The next day, intelligence was received, that on the 13th, Col. Greene, of the Rhode-I&s;land regiment, who was doing duty on the lines of the American army, was &s;urpri&s;ed by a body of the enemy's hor&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 150 dragoons, and that the
<PB N="289" REF="289">
Colonel, Maj. Flagg, two Subalterns, and 27 men were killed, and &s;everal wounded. Col. Greene was a brave and intrepid officer, and his lo&s;s was much regretted. The Colonel had taken po&s;t above and near to Croten River, at a place where the river was fordable, to prevent the enemy pa&s;&s;ing up by this ford to ravage the country. He had practi&s;ed the greate&s;t vigilance in guarding this ford in the night time, taking off the guards after &s;un-ri&s;e, ap|prehending that the enemy would never pre&s;ume to cro&s;s the river in the day time; but the enemy, hav|ing learnt his mode of doing duty, on the morning of the 13th effected his overthrow, by cro&s;&s;ing the ford &s;oon after the guards had come off, and &s;ur|rounding their quarters before they had an idea of any enemy being near them. In this &s;ituation, the utmo&s;t exertion could not then avail them.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Our General left Roxbury on his way to New-Hamp&s;hire, arrived at Exeter on the evening of the 24th, and delivered to the Honorable Mr. Weare the di&s;patches addre&s;&s;ed to him. The Le|gi&s;lature of New-Hamp&s;hire was not then in &s;e&s;&s;ion. The next day, he had an interview with the Hon|orable Pre&s;ident and the Council of Safety, when &s;uch repre&s;entations, (in addition to the requi&s;itions of the Commander in Chief) were made to them, as the exigencies of the ca&s;e required; and th&egrave; fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urances were received, that every aid in the power of the State &s;hould be afforded.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Our General left Exeter on his return, and on the 27th arrived at his hou&s;e in Roxbury. On the 29th, he again waited on Gov. Hancock, and reque&s;ted that the requi&s;itions of the Commander in Chief of the army might be predominant in all the public objects.</P>
<P>The 30th was the General Election day in Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts: and it appeared that his Excellency John
<PB N="290" REF="290">
Hancock was re-elected Governor, who, as &s;oon as the two Hou&s;es were organized, laid the requi&s;itions of Gen. Wa&s;hington before them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 2d.&mdash;Our General was heard before a Com|mittee of both Hou&s;es on the &s;ubject of his mi&s;&s;ion. The zeal and patrioti&s;m of the &s;everal Executives and Legi&s;latures of the New-England States, to relieve and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ply &s;upply the army with provi&s;ions, were &s;o con&s;picuous on this occa&s;ion, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay which, or whether any one of them exceeded the other; each was for making every exertion in its power; and, to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to their re&s;olutions, they all fell in with the recommendation of the Commander in Chief, and appointed Committees to meet in Convention, to dige&s;t and &s;y&s;temize the bu|&s;ine&s;s. The Committees met accordingly at Prov|idence, in Rhode-I&s;land, and were &s;o fortunate in their arrangements, that the mo&s;t ample &s;upplies of meat were afterwards furni&s;hed for the main army, and a &s;urplus of 100 head of beef cattle weekly &s;ent on after Gen. Wa&s;hington towards Virginia, until he ordered a di&s;continuance of that &s;upply, as will ap|pear in the &s;equel. While the New-England States were thus intent in &s;upplying meat for the army, the State of New-York was equally a&s;&s;iduous in furni&s;h|ing flour and forage.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Intelligence was received by a ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies, that the Count de Gra&s;&s;e, with a French fleet of upwards of 20 &s;ail of the line, had arrived in that quarter. The &s;ame day, there was a confirmation of this news, and that the fleet, with troops on board, was &s;een coming this way.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, intelligence was received, that there had been an action at the &s;outhward, between Gen. Greene and the Briti&s;h army in that quarter. Gen. Greene, having reconnoitred Cambden, did not think it expedient to &s;torm the enemy's works, but
<PB N="291" REF="291">
retired a little back, with a view to draw the enemy out; in this he &s;ucceeded, and an action commenc|ed. The Maryland troops being attacked under &s;ome di&s;advantage, an attempt was made to change their po&s;ition; this was unfortunately taken by Gen. Greene's army for a retreat, and the whole army retreated accordingly. Gen. Greene had 17 men killed; his retreat was about 2 or 3 miles, and the troops were in high &s;pirits. It is always a dan|gerous manoeuvre to change a po&s;ition in the face of an enemy; but nece&s;&s;ity &s;ometimes requires it.</P>
<P>Gen. Phillips, of the Briti&s;h army, had died in Virginia, of a fever.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;The Continental frigate, Alliance, arrived in Bo&s;ton harbour from France. The Alliance had taken 6 prizes; 2 We&s;t-Indiamen, 2 &s;loops of war, and 2 privateers. In the engagement with the &s;loops of war, both of which engaged the Alliance in a calm, Capt. Barry was wounded in the &s;houlder by a grape-&s;hot; the Captain of Marines, and 8 or 9 men killed, and about 20 wounded.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;Orders came on from Gen. Wa&s;hington, to forward with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch all the cannon, mortars, powder, &s;hot, &s;hells, and other military &s;tores belonging to the United States, which were then in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Rhode-I&s;land, and al&s;o re|que&s;ting the loan of &s;ome heavy artillery, powder, &amp;c. of the State. The mo&s;t &s;pirited mea&s;ures were taken for completing the Continental battalions, and rai&s;ing a body of militia to be in readine&s;s to march when called for.</P>
<P>The General A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in their &s;e&s;&s;ion at this time, pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions for &s;ettling with the troops of their line to the la&s;t of the year 1780, making good the depreciation of their pay, &amp;c.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h had formed a junction of their principal force at
<PB N="292" REF="292">
the &s;outhward in Virginia, by which means Gen. Greene would deprive them of all their po&s;ts in South-Carolina; that on the 10th of May, Lord Rawdon was compelled to evacuate Cambden with precipitation, leaving behind him 3 of his officers and 58 privates, who had been dangerou&s;ly wound|ed, and were unable to be removed. He burnt part of the town, and &s;ome of his baggage. On the 11th of the &s;ame month, the &s;trong po&s;t of Orangeburgh &s;urrendered to Gen. Sumpter; a Colonel, &s;everal officers, and upwards of 80 men were made pri&s;|oners. On the 12th, the garri&s;on of Fort Mott, con&s;i&s;ting of 7 officers, 12 non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and 165 privates, &s;urrendered by capitulation to Gen. Marrion. On the 15th, Fort Granby capitu|lated to Lieut. Col. Lee; 1 Lieut. Colonel, 2 Ma|jors, 6 Captains, 6 Lieutenants, 3 En&s;igns, 1 Sur|geon, 2 Serjeant-Majors, 17 Serjeants, 9 Corporals, and 305 privates &s;urrendered; large quantities of provi&s;ions, and &s;ome military &s;tores were taken at &s;ome of the po&s;ts. At the &s;ame time, the po&s;ts of Augu&s;ta and Ninety-Six were inve&s;ted by Gen. Pickens, and Gen. Greene on the 16th had deter|mined to march the army to expedite their reduction.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that &s;ome time before, the barracks in Fort Schuyler had taken fire, and were burnt down; and that afterwards the fort was di&s;mantled and evacuated. The &s;ame day it was reported, that the Spaniards had taken Pen&s;a|cola from the Briti&s;h. The marine mortars, and a number of heavy iron cannon, 18 and 24 pounders, were removing from Bo&s;ton to the North River, New-York. The Briti&s;h forces in Virginia, after their junction, were &s;aid to be about 6,000. The invalids, who had been doing duty in Bo&s;ton, receiv|ed orders to march to We&s;t-Point, where the whole
<PB N="293" REF="293">
corps was to be collected, and compo&s;e a part of the garri&s;on of that po&s;t.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;His Excellency the Commander in Chief was plea&s;ed to communicate to our General, that in the arrangement of the main army, the command of the right wing had been a&s;&s;igned to him.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;A ve&s;&s;el arrived at Bo&s;ton from Cadiz, with a quantity of cloathing for the United States. This ve&s;&s;el brought an account, that the Briti&s;h had again &s;uccoured the garri&s;on of Gibraltar, but that the Spaniards continued the &s;iege.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's frigate, the Servilante, arrived in Bo&s;ton harbour from the We&s;t-Indies; on her pa&s;&s;age had a warm engagement with a Briti&s;h &s;hip-of-war, when &s;ome damage was &s;u&s;tain|ed on both &s;ides. This frigate brought news, that the French had taken the i&s;land of Tobago, and had blocked up Admiral Rodney's fleet at Barbadoes.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 4th was celebrated at Bo&s;ton, being the Anniver&s;ary of the Declaration of American Inde|pendence.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Information was received, that Gen. Wa&s;h|ington had ordered the American troops from their &s;everal cantonments, and that the whole had a&s;&s;em|bled, and were encamped near Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>Some of the enemy's cruizers from Penob&s;cot were cruizing in the Bay, where they took &s;everal ve&s;&s;els; one within a league of the light-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that there had been a &s;kirmi&s;h between the Americans and Briti&s;h, between White Plains and King's Bridge, but no particulars were received.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Our General &s;et out from his hou&s;e in Roxbury for the army.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The enemy's &s;hipping, which were up the North River, ran down; there was a bri&s;k cannon|ade at Dobb's Ferry.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="294">
21&s;t.&mdash;The American field artillery, which had for &s;ome days been on board ve&s;&s;els in the North River, proceeded downwards to the neare&s;t landing to the army.</P>
<P>When the enemy's &s;hipping pa&s;&s;ed Dobb's Ferry, on the 19th, a box of powder on board the Savage &s;hip-of-war took fire, &s;uppo&s;ed by the bur&s;ting of a howitzer &s;hell, on which a number of the crew, ap|prehending that the &s;hip would blow up, jumped overboard into the river. An American, who was a pri&s;oner on board, jumped overboard at the &s;ame time, and &s;wam on &s;hore, relating what had happen|ed; he al&s;o reported, that the Savage was &s;everal times hulled by our &s;hot, and mu&s;t have &s;uffered con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The late &s;kirmi&s;h near King's Bridge was occa&s;ioned by the American army's moving down, in order to give the French officers a view of the Briti&s;h out-po&s;ts near the bridge. A number of Americans were killed and wounded by long &s;hot from the yaugers of the enemy, who kept up a popping fire whenever they could reach our troops.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Our General arrived at the army, which was encamped at Phillip&s;burgh, in two lines; the park of artillery in the centre of the &s;econd line. Accounts had been received from the &s;outhward, that the enemy had no footing in Georgia, except Savannah, nor in South-Carolina, except Charle&s;ton. The po&s;ition which the American army now occupied was between the lines the preceding campaigns; con&s;equently the roads and commons, as well as the fields and pa&s;tures, were covered with gra&s;s; while the many de&s;erted hou&s;es and ruined fences depicted the horrid deva&s;tations of war. The French army, under Gen. Rochambeau, was encamped at a &s;mall di&s;tance, on the left of the Americans, in one line.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;A forage was made towards Phillips's,
<PB N="295" REF="295">
conducted by Col. Scammel. It was &s;aid that &s;ome of the Briti&s;h troops had returned from the &s;outh|ward to New-York; and that tho&s;e in Virginia were collected at Port&s;mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t.&mdash;</HI>On the night of the 3d, about 11 o'clock, the Briti&s;h and American guard-boats met in the river, near Dobb's Ferry, when a con&s;iderable firing en&s;ued; we had one man badly wounded, who died &s;oon after. The damage &s;u&s;tained by the enemy was not known.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief, attended by a number of the General Officers, reconnoitred towards King's Bridge, covered by &s;trong detachments of cavalry and infantry. Three &s;hips and a galley lay in the river between Fort Wa&s;hington and Spitten-Devil Creek. The enemy did not make any move|ments. The morning of the 7th, about 2 o'clock, the army was awakened by the firing of cannon at Dobb's Ferry; it appeared that 2 of the enemy's gun-boats had come up as high as the ferry, proba|bly to endeavour to &s;eize &s;ome ve&s;&s;els or boats; on finding that they were di&s;covered, they fired four cannon, but to no effect. Four cannon were di&s;|charged at the boats from the battery, on which they went down the river. Two days before, Delancy's corps ventured as far above King's Bridge, as Phillips's.</P>
<P>News was received, that the great French Finan|cier, <HI>Neckar,</HI> had re&s;igned, and that Mon&s;ieur Fleury had been appointed in his room.</P>
<P>Capt. Salton&s;tall, formerly of the frigate Warren, who was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervice on account of his con|duct in the Penob&s;cot expedition, about this time be|haved mo&s;t gallantly in a privateer, on a cruize again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>The American army at this time continued in the &s;ame po&s;ition at Phillip&s;burgh. The Connecti|cut
<PB N="296" REF="296">
and Rhode-I&s;land lines, and 6 regiments of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts line, compo&s;ed the front line; the New-Hamp&s;hire line, four regiments of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, Crane's and Lamb's regiments of artillery, with the &s;appers and miners, the &s;econd line; the right wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Heath, the left wing by Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling; the advance of the American army on a height a little advanced of Dobb's Ferry, under the command of Col. Scam|mel, and Sheldon's dragoons near Dobb's Ferry. The French army in one line on the left of the Americans, with their legion under the Duke de Lauzun, at White Plains. Gen. Waterbury, with the militia under his command, towards New-Rochelle. The camps at this time &s;warmed with flies, which were very trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Robert Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the American Finan|cier, and Richard Peters, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the Members of the Board of War, vi&s;ited the army. The &s;ame day, the advance of the army took a po&s;ition a little more to the northward, and the dragoons were add|ed to Col. Scammel's command. A fleet arrived at New-York from England; they brought over be|tween 2 and 3,000 He&s;&s;ian recruits.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Col. Hazen's and Col. Van&s;caak's reg|iments joined the army. A French frigate arrived about this time at Rhode-I&s;land, &s;uppo&s;ed to have brought news of the approach of the Count de Gra&s;&s;e. A few nights before, Gen. Schuyler came very near being taken and carried off from his hou&s;e in Albany.</P>
<P>In the general orders of the 15th, the army was directed to hold it&s;elf in the mo&s;t perfect readine&s;s to march on the &s;horte&s;t notice.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;It was whi&s;pered, that the Count de Gra&s;&s;e, with 28 &s;ail of the line, be&s;ides frigates, with a num|ber of land forces on board, might &s;oon be expected
<PB N="297" REF="297">
on our coa&s;t, and the&s;e, with the &s;quadron under the command of the Chevalier de Barras, would make a fleet of 36 &s;ail of the line, a force probably &s;uperior to any the Briti&s;h could a&s;&s;emble in the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>Under pro&s;pects &s;o flattering, the Commander in Chief determined to &s;trike the enemy a capital blow in &s;ome quarter. To &s;trike at their very root in New-York, was a mo&s;t di&s;irable object; but the &s;ituation of New-York with Long-I&s;land, and Staten-I&s;land, and the adjacent country, was &s;uch, as would require a very large army to effect a complete inve&s;|titure, and give a proper &s;ecurity again&s;t the &s;allies of the enemy, which, from &s;ituation, might be ea&s;ily and frequently made&mdash;that &s;uch an army mu&s;t be compo&s;ed, in a very con&s;iderable degree, of militia, to whom the continuing long in camp had often been found di&s;agreeable; and the French were not without apprehen&s;ions that if their fleet entered the harbour of New-York, and became warmly engaged with the Briti&s;h &s;hips and batteries, in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e manoeuvres which it might be nece&s;&s;ary to make, &s;ome of their heavy &s;hips, through the want of a competent knowledge of all parts of the bay, might get aground, or be damaged; while all the&s;e incon|veniences would be avoided, in ca&s;e Lord Cornwallis, with the Briti&s;h army in Virginia, were made the ob|ject, and his capture would be almo&s;t certain, while the American main army might be left in &s;ufficient &s;trength, to act on the defen&s;ive again&s;t Sir Henry Clinton, and effectually cover the important po&s;ts in the Highlands of New-York.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;General Wa&s;hington was plea&s;ed to com|municate to our General, (in confidence) his inten|tions, at the &s;ame time intimating to him, that he &s;hould give him the command of the main army during his ab&s;ence. The whole of the French army, with the two regiments of New-Jer&s;ey, fir&s;t regiment
<PB N="298" REF="298">
of New-York, Col. Hazen's regiment, Col. Olney's regiment of Rhode-I&s;land, Col. Lamb's regiment of artillery, and the light troops under the command of Col. Scammel, were detached for the expedition again&s;t Lord Cornwallis, and the army under his command, at York-Town, in Virginia.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Some of the corps began to move towards the &s;erries. The next day, the Commander in Chief was plea&s;ed to honour our General with the follow|ing.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> General HEATH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are to take command of all the troops remaining in this department, con&s;i&s;ting of the two regiments of New-Hamp&s;hire, ten of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and five of Connecticut infantry, the corps of inva|lids, Sheldon's legion, the 3d regiment of artillery, together with all &s;uch State troops and militia as are retained in &s;ervice of tho&s;e which would have been under my own command.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of We&s;t-Point, and the po&s;ts in the Highlands, is to be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t object of your attention; in order to effect this, you will make &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, as in your judgment the circum|&s;tances &s;hall from time to time require, taking care to have as large a &s;upply of &s;alted provi&s;ions as po&s;|fible, con&s;tantly on hand; to have the fortifications, works, and magazines repaired and perfected as far as may be; to have the garri&s;on at lea&s;t, in all ca&s;es, kept up to its pre&s;ent &s;trength; to have the minutes, plans, and arrangements, for the defence and &s;upport of this important po&s;t, perfectly under&s;tood and vigor|ou&s;ly executed in ca&s;e of any attempt again&s;t it. Ample magazines of <HI>wood</HI> and <HI>forage</HI> are to be laid in, again&s;t the approaching winter; the former &s;hould be cut on the margin of the river, and tran&s;ported to the
<PB N="299" REF="299">
garri&s;on by water; the latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines, in the greate&s;t quantities po&s;&s;ible, and depo&s;ited in &s;uch places as you &s;hall judge proper.</P>
<P>The force now put under your orders, it is pre|&s;umed, will be &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es above mentioned, as well as to yield a very con&s;iderable protection and cover to the country, without haz|arding the &s;afety of the po&s;ts in the Highlands; this is to be e&s;teemed, as it re&s;pects the friendly inhabit|ants and re&s;ources of the country, and extremely intere&s;ting object; but when compared with the for|mer, of a &s;econdary nature. The protection of the northern and we&s;tern frontier of the State of New-York, as well as tho&s;e parts of that and other States mo&s;t contiguous and expo&s;ed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy, will claim your attention; but as the contingencies which are to be expected in the cour&s;e of this campaign, may be &s;o various, un|fore&s;een, and almo&s;t infinite, that no particular line of conduct can be pre&s;cribed for them&mdash;upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, you will be governed by your own prudence and di&s;cretion, on which the fulle&s;t confi|dence is placed.</P>
<P>Although your general rule of conduct will be to act on the defen&s;ive only, yet it is not meant to prohibit you from &s;triking a blow at the enemy's po&s;ts or detachments, &s;hould a fair opportunity pre|&s;ent it&s;elf. The mo&s;t eligible po&s;ition for your army, in my opinion, will be above (that is, on the north &s;ide) of the Croten, as well for the purpo&s;e of &s;up|porting the garri&s;on of We&s;t Point, annoying the enemy, and covering the country, as for the &s;e|curity and repo&s;e of your own troops.</P>
<P>Waterbury's brigade (which may be po&s;ted to|wards the Sound) Sheldon's corps, the State troops of New-York, and other light parties may occa&s;ion|ally
<PB N="300" REF="300">
be made u&s;e of to hold the enemy in check, and carry on the petit-guerre with them; but I would recommend keeping your force as much collected and compact as the nature of the &s;ervice will admit, doing duty by corps in&s;tead of detachments, when|ever it is practicable; and above all, exerting your|&s;elf mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, while the troops are in a camp of repo&s;e, to make them perfect in their exerci&s;e and manoeuvres, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem of di&s;cipline and duty. The good of the &s;ervice and emulation of corps, will, I am per&s;uaded, prompt the officers and men to de|vote their whole time and attention to the plea&s;ing and honourable ta&s;k of becoming ma&s;ters of their profe&s;&s;ion. The uncertainty which the pre&s;ent move|ment of the army will probably occa&s;ion with the enemy, ought to be increa&s;ed by every means in your power, and the deception kept up as long as po&s;&s;ible. It will not be expedient to prevent the militia, which were ordered, from coming in, until the arrival of the Count de Gra&s;&s;e, or &s;omething definite and certain is known from the &s;outhward; and even the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances may, (but of this you will be advi&s;ed) render it advi&s;eable to keep the enemy at New-York in check&mdash;prevent their detaching to reinforce their &s;outhern army, or to hara&s;s the inhabitants on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The redoubt on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Dobb's Ferry is to be di&s;mantled and demoli&s;hed; the platforms to be taken up, and tran&s;ported up the river, if it can be conveniently done. The block-hou&s;e on the oth|er &s;ide to be maintained, or evacuated and de&s;troyed, as you &s;hall judge proper. The water-guards, and other precautions to prevent &s;urpri&s;e, you will be plea&s;ed to take into your con&s;ideration, and regulate in &s;uch a manner as you &s;hall judge mo&s;t expedient.

<P>19th.&mdash;About noon, his Excellency Gen. Wa&s;h|ington left the army, &s;etting his face towards his na|tive State, in full confidence, to u&s;e his own words, <HI>"with a common ble&s;&s;ing,"</HI> of capturing Lord Corn|wallis and his army; while our General was left to watch Sir Henry Clinton, and guard again&s;t tho&s;e attempts which it was probable he would make to &s;uccour Cornwallis, direct, or by making &s;uch other movements as might tend to induce Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton to give up his object, or to avail him&s;elf of &s;ome important po&s;ts in his ab&s;ence. Sir Henry Clinton was con&s;equently on the rack, to devi&s;e &s;omething

which &s;hould effect this purpo&s;e; a &s;troke at the po&s;ts in the Highlands, Connecticut, New-Jer&s;ey, Al|bany and Philadelphia, was contemplated. Again&s;t all this had our General to guard.&mdash;Let impartiality judge, and candour decide on his conduct.</P>
<P>On the morning of the &s;ame day, the French ar|my marched from their encampment towards King's Ferry, where they were to cro&s;s the river. The American park of artillery, Col. Olney's regiment, and the New-York regiment, decamped and moved the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;A little after noon, our General ordered off the baggage to the &s;trong grounds near Young's, which at about 6 o'clock was followed by the army, marching by the left in one column, which took a &s;trong po&s;ition during the night. The pickets af|ter du&s;k were drawn back a little to the northward of the former encampment. The advanced parties under Maj. Scott were ordered to join their re&s;pec|tive regiments, and Sheldon's hor&s;e to patrole in the front.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Col. Putnam, with 320 infantry, Col. Sheldon's hor&s;e, and two companies of the New-York levies, were ordered to form an advance for the army, and remain at or near their pre&s;ent ground. About 12 o'clock at noon, the army took up its line of march, and halted at night on the lower parts of North-Ca&s;tle. Two regiments had been detached on the march to Sing-Sing church, to cover a quan|tity of baggage belonging to the French army, a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing it, &amp;c. and a detachment was &s;ent to the New Bridge, to &s;ecure a quantity of flour lodged near that place.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The army marched from North-Ca&s;tle, and encamped at Crom-Pond; all the French &s;tores at Tarrytown and Sing-Sing had been &s;ecured.</P>

23d.&mdash;The army marched from Crom-Pond, and took a &s;trong po&s;ition at Peek's Kill; the fir&s;t line encamping before the village, and the &s;econd behind it. After the troops were encamped, 80 waggons were &s;ent off to a&s;&s;i&s;t in forwarding the &s;tores of the army with Gen. Wa&s;hington. Intelligence was re|ceived that a frigate and &s;tore-&s;hip had arrived at Bo&s;ton, from France, with military &s;tores, &amp;c. for the United States.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The French troops had not all pa&s;&s;ed the Ferry&mdash;150 Americans were &s;ent to aid them, and at evening 150 more. Intelligence was received that a large French fleet had been &s;een &s;tanding for the continent.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;The whole of the French army had cro&s;&s;ed the river. Gen. Wa&s;hington was as far as Rama|paugh in the forenoon. Six de&s;erters came in from the enemy, and three pri&s;oners of war belonging to Delancy's corps, were &s;ent up; they had taken and were driving off about 30 &s;heep, which were re|covered.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Di&s;patches were &s;ent off to Gov. Trum|bull at Hartford, and Gov. Hancock at Bo&s;ton. A heavy cannonade was heard-towards New-York, from early in the morning till two in the afternoon, &s;uppo&s;ed to be off at &s;ea.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;At evening a detachment con&s;i&s;ting of 250 men, marched towards the New Bridge, where wag|gons were collecting for a grand forage, which was to be covered by this detachment and the troops on the lines&mdash;the whole under the command of Col. Greaton. By the la&s;t accounts, Gen. Wa&s;hington was as far as Chatham, in the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Colonel Laurens pa&s;&s;ed the army, on his way from Bo&s;ton to Philadelphia: he had brought from France a large &s;um in &s;pecie, for the United States. Col. Laurens reported the friendly di&s;po&s;i|tion
<PB N="304" REF="304">
of the European powers towards the United States; that Great-Britain continued to &s;tand with|out a &s;ingle ally, nor could &s;he obtain one in the war in which &s;he was engaged.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;The foragers returned with 42 loads of hay. A He&s;&s;ian rifleman came in with his rifle.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, letters were received from Gen. Wa&s;hington, dated at Trenton, the 29th ult. men|tioning that a Briti&s;h fleet of 15 &s;ail of the line had arrived at Sandy-Hook from the We&s;t-Indies. The &s;ame evening, about 40 Indians, from the Oneida and other neighbouring tribes, came to the army, on their way after Generals Wa&s;hington and Ro|chambeau.</P>
<P>2d.&mdash;Intelligence was received from New-York, that a fleet, under the command of Admiral Sir Sam|uel Hood, had arrived at Sandy-Hook from the We&s;t-Indies, con&s;i&s;ting of 14 &s;ail of the line, three 44 gun &s;hips, one of 28, a &s;loop and fire-&s;hip. The &s;hips of the line were, Barfleur, of 90 guns, Prin|ce&s;&s;a, Invincible, Alcide, Alfred, Ajax, Re&s;olution, Centaur, Intrepid, Terrible, Montague, Shrew&s;bury, Belliqueax, and&mdash;, 74 guns each. It was &s;aid that the 1&s;t battalion of Royal, 13th and 69th Brit|i&s;h regiments came in the fleet.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Gen. Wa&s;h|ington was at Philadelphia the preceding Friday, and that his army was to march from Trenton, as ye&s;|terday.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from New-York, that the Briti&s;h fleet had &s;ailed to counteract the French. The day before, the &s;outhern po&s;t-rider, with the mail, was &s;topped near Pompton in the Jer&s;ies, and the mail carried off; the hor&s;e was left in the road. The &s;ame day, a fleet of 26 &s;ail, &s;ome
<PB N="305" REF="305">
of which were large, pa&s;&s;ed Stamford to the ea&s;t|ward.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from New-York, that an embargo was laid on the &s;hipping there, and that 6 Briti&s;h tran&s;ports had been taken by the French. The enemy's &s;hipping in the North River above Fort Wa&s;hington, had all gone down.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from New-York, that the Count de Gra&s;&s;e had arrived in the Che&s;|apeak on the 31&s;t ultimo; that a 64 gun &s;hip and a frigate had entered York River; that Lord Corn|wallis was preparing for a vigorous defence; and that 6 &s;ail of victuallers had been taken by Admiral Barras. A heavy cannonade was heard the day be|fore, towards the Hook. The &s;ame day, there was much pa&s;&s;ing between the city and Fort Wa&s;hington, which occa&s;ioned a great ri&s;ing of du&s;t, vi&s;ible at a great di&s;tance; and there was a rumbling of car|riages in the night. Mr. Rivington, in his paper, ob&s;erved the pre&s;ent to be the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and critical era of the war. The &s;ame evening, a de|tachment marched from our army for a grand forage.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Two companies of Col. Wei&s;&s;enfel's reg|iment were ordered to Albany, to cover that city again&s;t the de&s;igns of the enemy. The &s;ame even|ing, our General received a letter from Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, dated at the Head of Elk the preceding day, in which he ob&s;erves, "I have it now in my power to congratulate you on the arrival of Count de Gra&s;&s;e, with 28 &s;hips of the line and &s;ome frigates, in the Che&s;apeak, with a body of land forces on board, which he debarked immediately on his arrival. On his pa&s;&s;age, he took Lord Rawdon, who was bound from Charle&s;ton to England. This arrival, with Col. Laurens, from France, mu&s;t fill the United States with the mo&s;t happy pro&s;pects and expecta|tions."
<PB N="306" REF="306">
&mdash;"I am thus far on my way to Vir|ginia, with the troops under my command; we are now embarking the heavy baggage, &s;tores, and &s;ome of the troops."&mdash;"I mu&s;t beg of you not to forget &s;ending the quantity of beef I reque&s;ted, as I mu&s;t at pre&s;ent altogether depend on that &s;upply."</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, intelligence was received, that the enemy's fleet, which &s;ailed up the Sound on the 4th, had made a de&s;cent on New-London. At evening, Maj. Talmadge, with 20 cavalry and 200 infantry, was ordered to move immediately towards the Sound. The preceding day, about 30 &s;ail of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ed the Sound towards New-York.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 9th the foragers returned, with 28 loads of hay.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Governor Trumbull, that the enemy had made a de&s;cent on New-London, on the evening of the 6th, with about 2,000 infantry and 300 light-hor&s;e. Their fleet con|&s;i&s;ted of about 40 &s;ail of &s;hips-of-war and tran&s;ports; they plundered the inhabitants of property to a large amount, and burnt a great part of the town. The militia behaved very gallantly, and a number of very valuable citizens were killed; among others, Col. Ledyard, Captains Salton&s;tall and Richards. The enemy, in three a&s;&s;aults on the fort on Groton &s;ide of the river, were repul&s;ed, but on the fourth attempt carried it. The militia collecting in greater num|bers, with &s;ome pieces of artillery, the enemy retreated on board their &s;hipping. Part of the American &s;hip|ping in the harbour were &s;cuttled, and &s;ome were run up the river. In Governor Trumbull's letter, the enemy were charged with behaving in a wanton and barbarous manner; and that of between 70 and 80 men who were killed, 3 only were killed before the enemy entered the Fort, and the garri&s;on had &s;ubmitted; that on Col. Ledyard's delivering his
<PB N="307" REF="307">
&s;word rever&s;ed, to the commanding officer, who en|tered the fort, the officer immediately plunged it in the Colonel's body, on which &s;everal &s;oldiers bayon|eted him. It is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that upon the foregoing taking place, an American officer, who &s;tood near to Col. Ledyard, in&s;tantly &s;tabbed the Briti&s;h officer who &s;tabbed the Colonel; on which, the Briti&s;h in|di&s;criminately bayoneted a great number of Ameri|cans.</P>
<P>This expedition was commanded by Arnold. The Briti&s;h lo&s;s was very con&s;iderable in killed and wound|ed; among the former was Major Montgomery. Ar|nold him&s;elf continued on the New-London &s;ide, and while his troops were plundering and burning, was &s;aid to have been at a hou&s;e where he was treated very politely; that while he was &s;itting with the gentleman regaling him&s;elf, the latter ob&s;erved, that he hoped his hou&s;e and property would be &s;afe; he was an&s;wered, that while he (Arnold) was there, it would not be touched; but the hou&s;e, except the room in which they were, was &s;oon plundered, and found to be on fire. During the plunder of the town, the Briti&s;h (as is always the ca&s;e in a plunder) were in great confu&s;ion, &s;etting their arms again&s;t trees and fences, while they were collecting and car|rying off their plunder; in this &s;ituation they might have been ea&s;ily defeated; nor would it have been the fir&s;t time that an army in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of victory, lo&s;t it in this way; hence by the articles of war, "If any officer or &s;oldier &s;hall leave his po&s;t or colours, to go in &s;earch of plunder, he is liable to &s;uffer death for the offence."</P>
<P>It is not meant to exculpate or to aggravate the con|duct of the enemy on this occa&s;ion&mdash;but two things are to be remembered; fir&s;t, that in almo&s;t all ca&s;es the &s;laughter does but begin when the vanqui&s;hed give way; and it has been &s;aid, that if this was fully
<PB N="308" REF="308">
con&s;idered, troops would never turn their backs, if it were po&s;&s;ible to face their enemy: Secondly, in all at|tacks by a&s;&s;ault, the a&s;&s;ailants, between the feelings of danger on the one hand, and re&s;olution to over|come it on the other, have their minds worked up almo&s;t to a point of fury and madne&s;s, which tho&s;e who are a&s;&s;ailed, from a confidence in their works, do not feel; and that con&s;equently when a place is carried, and the a&s;&s;ailed &s;ubmit, the a&s;&s;ailants cannot in&s;tantaneou&s;ly curb their fury to rea&s;on, and in this interval, many are &s;lain in a way which a cool by|&s;tander would call wanton and barbarous, and even the perpetrators them&s;elves, when their rage &s;ub&s;ided, would condemn; but while the human pa&s;&s;ions re|main as they now are, there is &s;carcely a remedy.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Arnold's fleet was &s;till in the Sound, and further depredations were expected; they were this morning at Killing&s;worth, and about noon 50 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els came to anchor between Norwalk and Stam|ford. Major Talmadge, who was returning, upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the enemy had returned to New-York, was ordered back immediately. Maj. Knapp was detached with 100 men to reinforce Col. Put|nam on the lines; and Brig. Gen. Huntington, with the fir&s;t Connecticut brigade, and a detachment of artillery was ordered to march towards the Sound. The &s;ame day, the army moved from its encampment at Peek's-Kill, and took a very &s;trong po&s;ition on Bald Hill, where it encamped in one line, the &s;econd line forming in the centre of the fir&s;t; and the 8th Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiment was ordered to march from the army, and reinforce the garri&s;on of We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the ene|my's anchoring off Stamford, Maj. Talmadge advan|ced towards the town; Gen. Huntington had ad|vanced as far as Bedford; and that the preceding morning the enemy's fleet came to &s;ail, and &s;tood
<PB N="309" REF="309">
principally to the we&s;tward; &s;ome of the fleet, at the &s;ame time, &s;tanding over to Huntington Bay, Long-I&s;land, Maj. Talmadge was to remain at or near Ca|naan, for the protection of the inhabitants; Gen. Huntington to return to the army.</P>
<P>The He&s;&s;ian recruits, which had a little before ar|rived at New-York, were very &s;ickly, and many died. The fleet which had arrived at New-York were in bad condition. The Prudente and Robu&s;te, lay at the &s;hip-yard; the Roebuck had been &s;ent to Halifax to repair, and had not returned. Mr. Rivington, in his paper, talked of another fleet coming out, un|der Admiral Digby.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;The enemy had &s;till a number of troops on board their tran&s;ports in the harbour. The &s;ame day, intelligence was received from Canada, that the enemy were preparing a number of canoes and &s;mall batteaux at St. John's, baking hard bread at Mon|treal, and forwarding it to St. John's, &amp;c. The Cork fleet had arrived at Quebec. The &s;ame day, about 40 &s;ail of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ed in the Sound to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a brigade of troops had lately come to St. John's, from whence an incur&s;ion on our northern frontier might be ex|pected; on which the whole of Wie&s;&s;en&s;el's regiment was ordered for Albany immediately; notice was al&s;o given to the ea&s;tern Governors, and the Briga|diers commanding the militia in the counties of Hamp&s;hire and Berk&s;hire, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, reque&s;t|ed to lend their aid, if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;A de&s;erter came in from New-York; he reported, that when he left the city, about 20 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els were falling down to the Hook, &s;aid to have troops on board.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The 2d and 5th Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, regiments were ordered to go into garri&s;on at We&s;t-Point, and
<PB N="310" REF="310">
the 7th regiment to join the army; it had before been in garri&s;on. The &s;ame day, intelligence was received from New-York, that there had been a na|val engagement off the Che&s;apeak, between 19 &s;ail of Briti&s;h men-of-war, and 24 French &s;hips of the line: the &s;tory was &s;o badly told in New-York, that there was good grounds to conclude that the Briti&s;h had received a &s;evere drubbing. On the 17th, when a packet arrived at New-York, 3,000 people were &s;aid to be waiting on the wharves to learn the news, but not a word tran&s;pired; nor did the countenance of the officer who landed, appear to beam with the &s;miles of fortune. The enemy had taken a number of heavy cannon from the grand battery, which were put on board &s;hip. The troops &s;till remained on board the tran&s;ports, and had fallen down to the Hook. A mortal &s;ickne&s;s prevailed in Delancy's corps, at Morri&s;&s;ania, which was much reduced in its numbers.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h fleet had been pretty &s;everely handled by the French, and &s;ome of the &s;hips were con&s;iderably damaged: that the inhabitants were in great con&s;ternation in New-York: many were packing up their goods: that Arnold's lo&s;s at New London, in both killed and wounded, was very con&s;iderable: that the 38th, 47th and 50th regiments were on that expedition, and then con&s;idered as unfit for duty. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was &s;aid to be embarked with the troops, report &s;aid from 7 to 8 thou&s;and; among them the Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian grenadiers, light-infan|try, 42d regiment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;A grand forage was made below the lines. The Briti&s;h fleet returned to the Hook on the 20th. The Prudente of 64 guns, had gone down in a mi&s;|erable condition to join the fleet; and the Robu&s;te of 74 guns, had hauled down nearly oppo&s;ite to the
<PB N="311" REF="311">
city. The heavy cannon had been taken from Fort Wa&s;hington, as well as the grand battery.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Forty-&s;ix loads of forage were brought off from below the lines. Mr. Rivington publi&s;hed an|other account of the naval engagement between the fleets on the 15th; he acknowledged that &s;everal &s;hips were much damaged, and that two which had come from the We&s;t-Indies leaky, were more &s;o af|ter the engagement: that in particular, the Terrible was &s;o much damaged, as occa&s;ioned the taking out her guns, &amp;c. and &s;etting her on fire; after which the fleet returned to the Hook, finding it impracticable to &s;uccour Lord Cornwallis. It was &s;aid that the troops which had embarked, (about 6,000) had de|barked on Staten I&s;land. Other accounts &s;tated their number not more than 4,000&mdash;they were impre&s;&s;ing and collecting waggons.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from Col. Wurmb's eorps, with their arms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;Apprehending that the enemy might have intentions of cro&s;&s;ing over from Staten I&s;land to the Jer&s;ies, a detachment of 300 infantry, with light ar|tillery, under the command of Col. Swift, were or|dered to cro&s;s the ferry the next morning, and move as far as Ramapaugh, to be at hand to aid the militia, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould land in the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from the north|ward, that a &s;mall party had been &s;ent from St. John's to Saratoga, to take a pri&s;oner or two, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining information; but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ive of the party, with the in&s;tructions of the Briti&s;h commandant at St. John's, were taken and brought in by Captain Dunham.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that Admiral Digby arrived at New-York the 25th in&s;t. with three &s;ail of the line, and one frigate. Prince William Henry, the King of England's third &s;on, came in
<PB N="312" REF="312">
this fleet. It was &s;aid in New-York, that Lord Corn|wallis's force in Virginia con&s;i&s;ted of 5,000 regular troops, and 3,000 levies; but that behind him was a numerous continental army&mdash;before him a powerful French fleet. The troops on Staten I&s;land were at this time &s;u&s;pected to be planning &s;ome &s;ecret ex|pedition; and Congre&s;s, from &s;ome intelligence which they had received, were not without appre|hen&s;ions that Philadelphia might be their object. The militia of Penn&s;ylvania were held in readine&s;s for in&s;tant &s;ervice; and our General was notified to hold the army in readine&s;s to move, if nece&s;&s;ary. The enemy were carefully watched. Sir Henry Clinton was endeavouring to devi&s;e &s;ome means whereby he might relieve Lord Cornwallis; but nothing would have diverted Gen. Wa&s;hington from capturing him. The New-York papers were fill|ed with addre&s;&s;es and adulations to their young Prince; but the&s;e could not retard the advances of a WASHINGTON, or defend Cornwallis. The fleet of Count de Gra&s;&s;e made &s;everal captures.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2d.&mdash;A detachment marched for a grand forage.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;At 3 o'clock, A. M. Major Tre&s;cott, with a detachment of 100 men from Maj. Talmadge's com|mand, cro&s;&s;ed the Sound to Long-I&s;land, and com|pletely &s;urpri&s;ed the enemy's Fort <HI>Slonge,</HI> making 2 Captains, 1 Lieutenant, and 18 rank and file, pri&s;|oners; of the enemy, 2 were killed, and 2 wounded; of the Americans, none were killed, and but one wounded. Two double fortified 4 pounders, found in the fort, were damaged. One bra&s;s three-pound|er, with a number of &s;mall-arms, ammunition, cloath|ing, Briti&s;h goods, &amp;c. were brought off. This enter|prize was conducted with addre&s;s and gallantry.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;The foragers returned, with upwards of 40 loads of hay.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="313">
5th.&mdash;A detachment of dragoons were &s;ent to|wards Bo&s;ton, and 100 picked infantry under Maj. Morrel were to march towards Springfield, to e&s;cort a large &s;um of money (brought by Col. Laurens) to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;The enemy were again embarking their troops from Staten I&s;land; they embarked on board the men-of-war. Con&s;idering their ca&s;e as de&s;perate, they were determined to make one de&s;perate attempt. Ten or twelve fire-&s;hips were prepared to &s;ail with the fleets; they were filled with proper materials for the purpo&s;e, and, to prevent &s;u&s;picion, they were new painted, had guns, and the appearance of &s;ome of the hand&s;ome&s;t &s;hips in the fleet.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;A detachment was &s;ent on a grand forage. The &s;ame day, intelligence was received, that a party of refugees and Indians, from Niagara, had burnt a number of hou&s;es and barns at Warwor&s;ing; they were pur&s;ued by Col. Paulding, but could not be come up with. Sir Henry Clinton, in his orders of the 3d, directed 3,000 regular troops to embark on board the men-of-war as marines; it was &s;uppo&s;ed that every thing would be ready by the 14th. Se|cret intelligence had been received from Albany, that the enemy had intentions on that city; that they would advance by different routes, and on their near approach, would be joined by &s;ome di&s;affected people in the country, and the de&s;truction of the city be ef|fected. Brig. Gen. Stark had been in command for &s;ome time at the northward.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Our General ordered the 2d New-Hamp|&s;hire regiment, and a detachment of artillery, to the northward. Gen. Stark had executed a Mr. Love|le&s;s, &s;ent in by Capt. Dunham, as a &s;py.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the enemy had advanced to this &s;ide of Lake George.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="314">
14th.&mdash;The 1&s;t New-Hamp&s;hire and 10th Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts regiments, with a detachment of artillery, were ordered to Albany, were matters wore a more &s;erious a&s;pect.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that on the 28th ult. Gen. Wa&s;hington took a po&s;ition in the neigh|bourhood of York&mdash;the enemy gave him no annoy|ance: on his advancing, a body of hor&s;e paraded before the enemy's works; but retired upon the di&s;|charge of a few &s;hot at them.</P>
<P>The 29th was &s;pent in taking another po&s;ition as near the enemy's advanced works, as could be done without placing the encampment in the range of their &s;hot. Some &s;kirmi&s;hing happened between our rifle|men and the yaugers, in which the former had the advantage. At night, the enemy abandoned all their out-po&s;ts, (&s;ome of which were very advantageous) and retired to the town; the Americans occupied the &s;ame ground, and made lodgements at a &s;hort di&s;tance from the enemy's lines. The heavy artil|lery was to be brought up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and the &s;iege pu&s;hed with vigour.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;Col. Scammell, who was officer of the day, was wounded and taken pri&s;oner by a party of the enemy's hor&s;e, as he was reconnoitring one of the works which had ju&s;t before been evacuated.</P>
<P>Our General had ordered Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling to proceed to Albany, and take the command of the troops in that quarter; he &s;et out for the northward about noon on the 16th. The &s;ame day, Col. Tup|per, with the 1&s;t New-Hamp&s;hire and 10th Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts regiments, and a detachment of artillery, embarked at Fi&s;hkill Landing, and arrived at Albany in 18 hours afterwards. The &s;ame day, it was learnt that the enemy's fleet at New-York, was 24 or 25 &s;ail of the line; and that 5 or 6,000 of the be&s;t troops at New-York had embarked, and were on the
<PB N="315" REF="315">
point of &s;ailing to attempt to relieve Earl Cornwallis; it was al&s;o &s;aid that Cornwallis was &s;hort of bread, and that his meat provi&s;ions would not la&s;t him more than the mouth out, at farthe&s;t&mdash;he had received fre&s;h provi&s;ions but once after he was blockaded.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 17th, a hor&s;e-guard be|longing to Gen. Howe's divi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;er|jeant, 9 privates, and 8 waggoners, with 30 hor&s;es, were taken by Delancy's hor&s;e a little below Croten River, where the hor&s;es had been put to pa&s;ture con|trary to orders. A Court of Inquiry was ordered to inve&s;tigate the matter.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;It was learnt, that on the preceding Satur|day, a Briti&s;h 74 gun &s;hip was &s;truck by the light|ning at New-York, and &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable dam|age.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Gen. Greene's official letter to Congre&s;s, announced that his battle on the 8th, near Eutaw Springs, was well fought; that on the field he ob|tained the victory, drove and pur&s;ued the enemy for &s;everal miles; when the enemy, throwing them&s;elves into a three-&s;tory brick hou&s;e, a &s;tockaded garden, and thick bru&s;h, renewed the action, when, after &s;ome efforts to di&s;lodge them, Gen. Greene thought it ad|vi&s;eable to call off his troops, which was done, and the wounded brought off, except &s;uch as were under the fire of the hou&s;e. Four bra&s;s &s;ix-pounders hav|ing had their hor&s;es killed, were al&s;o le&s;t near the hou&s;e, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy. This was &s;ome|what &s;imilar to what took place at Germantown battle, and now very probably &s;aved the Briti&s;h from a total defeat. The clo&s;e of this action barred its being called a complete victory, although its <HI>e&s;&s;ects</HI> proved it &s;uch. General Greene, of Continental State troops and militia, had one Lieutenant Colo|nel, 1 Major, 6 Captains, 8 Subalterns, 8 Serjeants, and 114 rank and file killed&mdash;5 Lieutenant Colonels,
<PB N="316" REF="316">
13 Captains, 25 Subalterns, 32 Serjeants, and 300 rank and file wounded&mdash;1 Serjeant, and 40 rank and file mi&s;&s;ing&mdash;1 Brigadier-General of militia wound|ed. Of the enemy, 500 pri&s;oners, including the wounded, which the enemy left behind them, were taken; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the killed and other wounded of the enemy, mu&s;t be nearly 600 more. Perhaps troops never fought better than the Ameri|cans did in this battle; and of the Briti&s;h, General Greene ob&s;erved, "the enemy fought with equal &s;pirit, and worthy of a better cau&s;e."</P>
<P>By a letter from Gen. Wa&s;hington, of the 6th, it appeared that the operations again&s;t Earl Cornwallis had then gone on but &s;lowly, but that the trenches were to be opened that night. The &s;ame letter ob|&s;erved, that &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding, which had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted in Vermont, was &s;ettled; and that Gen. Enos, and the troops under his command, were to be &s;ub|ject to the orders of our General.</P>
<P>The army in the Highlands were at this time &s;hort of flour, occa&s;ioned by the dry &s;ea&s;on, and con|&s;equent want of water for the mills.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;A letter was received from Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, dated at York, in Virginia, the 12th, by which it appeared that the trenches were opened on the night of the 6th, without being di&s;covered by the enemy until day-light. The approaches were carried on within 600 yards of the enemy's works, without any lo&s;s&mdash;the 7th and 8th were employed in erecting batteries&mdash;on the 9th, two batteries, one on the right, and the other on the left, were opened. The next morning, four other batteries being com|pleted, the whole opened a heavy fire of cannon and mortars, which &s;oon become &s;o warm as to drive the enemy from their guns, and their fire was almo&s;t to|tally &s;ilenced&mdash;very little return was made after|wards. The Charron, of 44 guns, with one tran&s;|port,
<PB N="317" REF="317">
took fire from our &s;hot or &s;hells, the evening of the 10th, and were both con&s;umed. The 11th, an|other &s;hip was de&s;troyed in the &s;ame manner. The &s;ame night, the &s;econd parallel was advanced within le&s;s than 400 yards of the enemy's lines. This ap|proach was al&s;o effected without annoyance; and on the 12th, the fatigue men were &s;ecurely covered, while they were completing the works. The &s;ame evening there was a flying report, and which &s;eemed to gain credit, that Earl Cornwallis, and his army, &s;urrendered on the 17th; and that Count de Gra&s;&s;e had gone out to meet Admiral Digby.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Intelligence was received of the advance of the enemy at the northward.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Col. Francis, with the &s;pecie from Bo&s;ton, pa&s;&s;ed the river; the money was e&s;corted by 40 hor&s;e of Sheldon's regiment, and 150 infantry; and Lieut. Col. Mellen, was ordered with a detachment of infantry, to move on the lower road as far as Morri&s;town, keeping between the e&s;cort and the enemy.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;In the afternoon, a letter from Gen. Wa&s;h|ington to our General, announced the plea&s;ing and highly important news of the complete capture of Earl Cornwallis, and his whole army, on the 19th. Our General had a&s;&s;ured the army, that the moment he received the certain intelligence of the capture of Cornwallis, it &s;hould be announced to them by the di&s;charge of 13 cannon, near his quarters; the&s;e were now the heralds to the army, and were in&s;tant|ly an&s;wered by a like number of field pieces in eve|ry brigade on the ground.</P>
<P>On the 15th, two of the enemy's redoubts were &s;tormed, one by the Americans, and the other by the French troops, and &s;oon carried, with but little lo&s;s. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e redoubts, gave the allied army in a great mea&s;ure the command of the
<PB N="318" REF="318">
other works of the enemy; who, on the 17th, beat a parley, and on the 19th &s;urrendered: 3,500 regu|lar troops laid down their arms; 2,000 more were &s;ick and wounded, in the ho&s;pitals. The&s;e were exclu&s;ive of &s;ailors, negroes, &amp;c. Earl Cornwal|lis was to go to England on parole, and remain a pri&s;oner until exchanged. The officers and men were to be exchanged as far as the garri&s;on of Charle&s;ton would extend; the remainder were to continue pri&s;oners of war; the Briti&s;h were to retain their private baggage. It was &s;aid that more than 100 ve&s;&s;els were taken from the enemy. A detail of the pri&s;oners taken, was &s;tated as follows: one Lieut. General, one Brig. General, 2 Colonels, 14 Lieut. Colonels, 16 Majors, 97 Captains, 180 Lieu|tenants, 55 En&s;igns, 4 Chaplains, 6 Adjutants, 18 Quarter-Ma&s;ters, 18 Surgeons, 25 Mates, 385 Ser|jeants, 197 Drummers and Trumpeters, 6,039 rank and &s;ile, 189 in the Commi&s;&s;ary's department&mdash;&s;ailors in the pay of the King, 840&mdash;killed during the &s;iege, 309&mdash;de&s;erters, 44&mdash;75 bra&s;s cannon, 169 iron do. 5,743 mu&s;kets with bayonets, 915 mu&s;kets without bayonets, and 1,136 damaged mu&s;kets were among the trophies of victory. Thus was the principal force of the enemy cru&s;hed in the &s;outh. At the northward, the enemy were advancing, both by the way of the Lakes and by the Mohawk River. Col. Willet, with his regiment of New-York levies, and &s;ome militia of New-York, and from the we&s;tern parts of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, were advancing to meet Maj. Ro&s;s, who, with from 500 to 700 men, principally Briti&s;h troops, was making his way towards Albany, through the &s;ettle|ments on the Mohawk.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Intelligence was received that an action <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ook place the preceding Thur&s;day, near John&s;town, between the troops under the command of Col. Willet and Maj. Ro&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="319">
Col. Willet having advanced until he had arrived near Maj. Ro&s;s, detached Maj. Rowley of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, with a body of militia, by a circuitous move|ment, to get in the rear of the enemy, with orders, that as &s;oon as he heard the firing in the front, to fall on them. Maj. Rowley performed his manoeu|vre accordingly; and as &s;oon as Col. Willet judged that the Major had gained the rear of the enemy, he made a vigorous charge on their front, when they immediately gave way, and to all appearance the Colonel was nearly in the gra&s;p of victory, when, all at once, without any vi&s;ible occa&s;ion the levies came to a &s;tand, and then immediately began to fall back, the enemy facing about and charging vigorou&s;ly; the Colonel's bra&s;s field-piece and ammunition tum|brel fell into the hands of the enemy, and a rout &s;eemed to be taking place, when Maj. Rowley, not knowing what had taken place in the front, com|menced a bri&s;k attack on the enemy's rear; this in|&s;tantly threw them into confu&s;ion; the levies rallied in the front, and fought with redoubled bravery; the field-piece and tumbrel were retaken, and the ene|my put to a mo&s;t complete rout, and pur&s;ued until the levies, militia, and &s;ome Oneida Indians who were with Col. Willet, were worn down with fatigue. It was not po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the number of the enemy's &s;lain; for, to u&s;e the words of the re|porting officer, "Unle&s;s the &s;wamps and rivers, in which they fell, were to report the killed, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to make a return of them." Major Butler, &s;o frequently a trouble&s;ome partizan officer on the frontiers, was killed by the Indians, as he was pa&s;&s;ing a river. Fifty-two pri&s;oners were taken and brought in; and Major Ro&s;s went off in a direction into the woods, where he and his troops mu&s;t have &s;uffered extremely for provi&s;ions, &amp;c.&mdash;Of the levies and mi|litia with Col.

</LETTER>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;The army in the Highlands, celebrated the glorious victory obtained over Lord Cornwallis. The whole army was under arms in one line; the
<PB N="321" REF="321">
artillery inter&s;per&s;ed with the brigades to which it was attached: at 12 o'clock, the army was reviewed by the General; at one, a grand <HI>feu-de-joy</HI> was fir|ed; after which, all the officers dined together, at a table &s;pread in the field, and formed a great &s;quare, where great fe&s;tivity and &s;ocial mirth prevailed. The &s;oldiery had an extra boon on the occa&s;ion; and, to crown the whole, in the mid&s;t of the joy around the table, an officer approached our General, and informed him, that, at the reque&s;t of the pri&s;|oners in the provo&s;t, (who were pretty numerous) he was de&s;ired to repre&s;ent that their hearts ex|panded with joy on account of the glorious victory obtained by their illu&s;trious Commander in Chief&mdash;that they lamented they could not expre&s;s it with their comrades in arms; but that they did it heartily in their confinement, and &s;olicited the General's goodne&s;s in an order for &s;omething to cheer their &s;pirits. This was in&s;tantly done, with an additional order to the officer of the provo&s;t guard, to &s;et every pri&s;oner in confinement at liberty. The promulga|tion of this order drew a &s;hout of approbation from the whole body of the officers at the table; and probably had a better effect on the di&s;cipline of the army, than a continuation of confinement, and ex|emplary puni&s;hment of the culprits, could have pro|duced. The general order of the day directed, that, "As &s;oon as the <HI>feu-de-joy</HI> is over, the arms, am|munition, &amp;c. are immediately to be put in perfect order for in&s;tant action. All guards, pickets, and centinels to be vigilant and alert on their po&s;ts;" which, notwith&s;tanding the joy of the day, was &s;trictly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion there were rejoicings in all parts of the United States: one in&s;tance &s;eems to be worthy of notice; the company collected had deter|mined to burn Gen. Arnold in <HI>effigy,</HI> for his treach|ery
<PB N="322" REF="322">
at We&s;t-Point; ju&s;t as they were going to com|mit the effigy to the flames, one of the company ob|&s;erved, that one of Arnold's legs was wounded when he was fighting bravely for America, that this leg ought not to be burnt, but amputated; in which the whole company agreed; and this leg was taken off, and &s;afely laid by.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3d.&mdash;At night, the e&s;cort with the &s;outh|ern mail, who had put up at Col. Cooper's, in Clark's Town, were attacked by a gang of villains, who fir|ed into the hou&s;e, and killed the Serjeant dead on the &s;pot, and wounded Capt. Champion, of Connecticut, who had put up at the &s;ame hou&s;e, in the &s;houlder: the Corporal of the e&s;cort behaved well, threw the mail behind a bed, and defended the hou&s;e&mdash;the a&s;&s;ailants made off.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the foragers returned from below the lines, with a large quantity of forage, and two pri&s;oners, taken near Col. Phillips's.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;A He&s;&s;ian yauger came in, with his hor&s;e and equipments complete.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from New-York; they left the city the evening before&mdash;they were very intelligent; by them it was learnt that the Briti&s;h fleet returned to Sandy Hook, the preceding Satur|day was a week&mdash;that no action happened while they were at &s;ea&mdash;that the troops were di&s;embarked from the men-of-war, but remained on board the tran&s;|ports&mdash;that Gen. Sir Henry Clinton landed on Long-I&s;land, and came acro&s;s to the city.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from the north|ward, that the enemy did not e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t at Ti|conderoga, but were returning towards Canada; and the militia which had been called out, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The Briti&s;h at New-York, at this time, wi&s;hed to &s;trike &s;ome of the po&s;ts in the Highlands,
<PB N="323" REF="323">
but did not attempt any of them. The army was &s;hort of flour, but amply &s;upplied with meat.</P>
<P>About this time, our General received a letter from Gen. Wa&s;hington, dated at York, (Virginia) October 27th, 1781; in which, among other things, the Commander in Chief ob&s;erves: "There will be no occa&s;ion for forwarding on any more beef cattle, from the northward, for this army. Should there be a greater quantity of cattle &s;ent from the New-England States, than the daily con&s;umption of your army &s;hall require, I would wi&s;h the &s;urplus might be &s;alted (if practicable) at &s;ome convenient place on the North River; otherwi&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to give orders to the Agents and Commi&s;&s;aries, to pre|vent their &s;ending more cattle than you &s;hall have occa&s;ion for." This was the good fruit of the &s;y&s;|tematic arrangement.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Gen. Glover, with his own brigade, march|ed for the lines, in order to cover a grand forage.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;Lieut. Defore&s;ter, of the Connecticut line, with 25 continental &s;oldiers, and Capt. Lockwood, with 15 volunteers, including Lieutenants Hull and Mead, of the Connecticut State troops, took an arm|ed &s;loop of 10 carriage-guns, with 25 &s;oldiers on board. Lieut. Defore&s;ter, and tho&s;e with him, be|haved with great addre&s;s and gallantry.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;Brig. Gen. Glover returned from the grand forage; during the forage, one of the enemy was killed, and two taken pri&s;oners; a quantity of corn, hay, &amp;c. and about 40 &s;wine, were brought off.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The 3d Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigade moved to their ground of cantonment, &s;outh of the north re|doubt, where they built their huts.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Admiral Digby remained at New-York, with &s;even &s;ail of the line, five of 74, and two of 64 guns, two fifties, two frigates, one 20 gun &s;hip, and two &s;loops of war; the remainder of the Briti&s;h fleet,
<PB N="324" REF="324">
under the command of Admiral Greaves, &s;ailed from Sandy Hook the preceding Monday, for the We&s;t-Indies; a great number of &s;hipping, perhaps 300 &s;ail, were lying in New-York harbour; the enemy and inhabitants appeared much dejected.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Col. Tupper, with the 10th Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiment, a detachment of artillery, &amp;c. arrived at We&s;t-Point, from Albany.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;The Connecticut line marched to their can|tonment, back of Con&s;titution I&s;land, and the corps of artillery to We&s;t-Point. The &s;ame day, Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling returned to the army, from Albany.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Our General removed his quarters from the Continental Village to Robin&s;on's Farm, for win|ter-quarters. The army in want of flour and forage.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The 1&s;t Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigade moved to their cantonment, back of We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 2d.&mdash;The militia which had been called out for 3 months, were returning home. They had &s;erved with much reputation, and done good &s;ervice for their country.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Capt. Sacket, of the New-York levies, near Harri&s;on's Purcha&s;e, below the lines, having gone a &s;mall di&s;tance from his detachment, on the morning of the 2d, was taken pri&s;oner by a party of the ene|my. The enemy afterwards attacked Lieut. Mo&s;her, to whom the command of the detachment fell; Lieut. Mo&s;her and the detachment behaved with great bravery, repul&s;ed the enemy, killed one of them and two hor&s;es, and wounded eight of the enemy; among them a Capt. Kipp, &s;aid mortally; Colonel Holmes and Capt. Kipp had their hor&s;es killed un|der them. The levies had not a man killed or wounded.</P>
<P>The army were now bu&s;ily employed in building their huts, which they pro&s;ecuted with great expe|dition,
<PB N="325" REF="325">
and &s;oon rendered them comfortable as to &s;helter; but many of the troops were in a mo&s;t nak|ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition as to clothing; but re|lief was daily arriving from the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The officers and &s;oldiers, who had been in Virginia, were now returning to the army. Some of the &s;oldiers brought the &s;mall-pox with them.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;The river was frozen down to Fi&s;hkill Landing.</P>
<P>The 13th was a general Thank&s;giving Day; a large company of the officers of the army dined with our General.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The Clothier-General was i&s;&s;uing the new clothing to the regimental Pay-Ma&s;ters&mdash;a mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary piece of bu&s;ine&s;s. Congre&s;s about this time, by re&s;olutions which they pa&s;&s;ed, called upon the Legi&s;latures of the re&s;pective States, to complete their quotas of the army by the fir&s;t of March en&s;uing, Congre&s;s being determined to pu&s;h the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, until the enemy were driven from America. The preceding day, viz. the 23d, Capt. Williams, of the New-York levies, (&s;tationed on the lines) with 25 volunteer hor&s;e, made an excur&s;ion to Morri&s;&s;ania, where they took and brought off pri&s;oners, one Cap|tain, one Lieutenant, and &s;even privates, of Delan|cy's corps, without the lo&s;s of a man. Capt. Wil|liams conducted this enterprize with addre&s;s and gallantry. Capt. Pritchard moved down with a de|tachment of continental troops, to cover the hor&s;e, if nece&s;&s;ary; but the enemy did not come out.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Five de&s;erters came in from Arnold's corps, with their hor&s;es, &amp;c. complete: they were a patrole to a foraging party, near Col. Phillips's. An embarkation of troops was taking place at New-York, for Charle&s;ton and Savannah; Gen. Le&s;lie having written, that without a reinforcement he could not maintain his po&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="326">
27th.&mdash;Free Ma&s;ons celebrated the fea&s;t of St. John, &amp;c.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;The river was a little freed of the ice.&mdash;Thus clo&s;ed the year 1781, a year which will be mem|orable in the annals of the United States of America, for the capture of Earl Cornwallis and his army&mdash;for &s;everal well-fought battles in the &s;outh by Gen. Greene and the Briti&s;h, in that quarter&mdash;for the Count de Gra&s;&s;e's having vi&s;ited our coa&s;t with the mo&s;t formidable fleet ever before in the&s;e &s;eas&mdash;and for general &s;ucce&s;&s;es on the American arms, under the &s;miles of Divine Providence, in every quarter. May the new year be rendered more au&s;picious in the completion of the American warfare, and in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the United States in the full ac|knowledgment of independence, peace and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>1782. <HI>January</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;A new mode of &s;upplying the army by contract commenced, under the con|duct of <HI>Comfort Sands and Co.</HI> contractors.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Nine &s;oldiers had then died of the &s;mall|pox: it was &s;preading, and it was determined to inoculate &s;uch as had not had the di&s;temper; which took place in the Connecticut line on the 11th.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;Capt. Hunnewell, of New-York, with a number of volunteer hor&s;e, covered by Maj. Tre&s;|cott, with a detachment of continental troops, made an excur&s;ion to Morri&s;&s;ania, took and brought off pri&s;oners Capt. Totten, and three privates of Delan|cy's corps; it was the intent to have captured the Colonel, but he was ab&s;ent from his quarters. A party of the enemy's hor&s;e collected and pur&s;ued Capt. Hunnewell, but they were checked by Major Tre&s;cott, and no injury was &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;It was learnt, that on the 4th, a fleet of 25 &s;ail of victuallers arrived at New-York from Cork,
<PB N="327" REF="327">
under convoy of the Quebec frigate; ten &s;ail more were left at Charle&s;ton, where the whole touched.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;The river was hard frozen again, and was pa&s;&s;able on the ice, from We&s;t-Point to Con&s;titution I&s;land. The &s;ame day, a &s;erjeant and four dragoons came in from Arnold's corps, with &s;ix hor&s;es and fur|niture complete. The &s;ixth dragoon would not come off, on which the others took from him his hor&s;e, cloak, &s;word, &amp;c. They de&s;erted from a for|aging party, and reported that a great part of the corps would de&s;ert, when opportunity offered.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Three dragoons came in from Arnold's corps, with their hor&s;es, &amp;c. complete; and one pri&s;oner taken by our guides, near Morri&s;&s;ania, was &s;ent up.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;Lieut. Hiwill, cro&s;&s;ing the river on the ice, fell through, but fortunately got out again.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;It was communicated, that about the month of the preceding October, one&mdash;was offered two thou&s;and guineas to take Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, and five hundred to take and bring in Gov. Read.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;News was received, that the Marquis de Boullie, Governor of Martinico, had recaptured the I&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatia, where he made pri&s;oners of 670 men. The Count De Gra&s;&s;e, with 31 &s;ail of the line, had arrived at Martinico before the 6th of De|cember. The Briti&s;h fleet from New-York had ar|rived at Barbadoes.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Some unea&s;ine&s;s having taken place on account of the i&s;&s;ues of provi&s;ions under the contract, the officers commanding brigades were ordered, on the part of the army, to endeavour an adju&s;tment with the contractors, who went for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;A man and his hor&s;e fell through the ice, near We&s;t-Point; &s;everal &s;oldiers lent their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, but in vain&mdash;both were drowned.</P>

31&s;t.&mdash;The whole of the troops who had not be|fore had the &s;mall-pox, were then under the opera|tion of inoculation&mdash;their number near 2,000; &s;ev|eral had died, but in general it was very favourable.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 8th.&mdash;News was received, that the Duke de Lauzun, who carried to France the news of the capture of Earl Cornwallis, arrived in France in 23 days after he left the Che&s;apeak; that there were great rejoicings in France on the occa&s;ion, and al&s;o for the birth of a Dauphin.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;The river had been pa&s;&s;able on the ice for &s;everal days, at King's Ferry. On the preceding Thur&s;day, about 50 of Delancy's hor&s;e came out within four miles of Shapequa, where they halted. On the 8th, they moved towards North-Ca&s;tle, but turned off by Wright's Mills; from thence to King|&s;treet, and towards Hor&s;eneck; they fell in with a &s;mall guard of Gen. Waterbury's&mdash;killed one, and made four pri&s;oners; they al&s;o took two or three inhabitants, plundered two hou&s;es, and returned. About this time, a detachment from the Jer&s;ey line made an attempt on the refugee po&s;t at Bergen, but were repul&s;ed.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;The King of England's &s;peech to his Par|liament came to hand: this &s;peech was more mod|erate than any before had been, and an inclination to pacification was di&s;cernable.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from Arnold's corps, and al&s;o two He&s;&s;ians; ten had come in, du|ring the cour&s;e of two or three days.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;The enemy were out towards Bedford. About this time, nine or ten thou&s;and &s;tand of arms, and a large quantity of powder, brought from France by Col. Laurens, were brought from Bo&s;ton to Fi&s;hkill.</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;A detachment, con&s;i&s;ting of 150 men, prop|erly officered, under the command of Maj. Max|well,
<PB N="329" REF="329">
marched for Stamford, to cover that part of the country.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Col. Sumner arrived from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; he brought on about 2,000 &s;uits of clothes for the ar|my. The day before, a Mr. Dyckman, one of our guides on the lines, with 13 volunteer hor&s;emen, made an excur&s;ion to Morri&s;&s;ania, took five pri&s;on|ers of Delancy's corps, and five hor&s;es; on their return, they were pur&s;ued by a party of the enemy's hor&s;e, who coming rather too near, the brave vol|unteers faced about, charged vigorou&s;ly, took one man pri&s;oner with his hor&s;e, and put the re&s;t to flight. The enemy again appeared in &s;ome force at a di&s;tance, but dared not to renew the attack. A|bout this time, a fleet of tran&s;ports &s;ailed from New-York to the &s;outhward; it was conjectured to bring away troops.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 3d.&mdash;The river was &s;o freed of ice, that the General's barge cro&s;&s;ed to We&s;t-Point. Two pri&s;oners of war taken from Delancy's corps, were &s;ent up. Accounts from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts announced an unea&s;ine&s;s among the people re&s;pecting the bur|den of taxes; and that there had been Conventions in the counties of Hamp&s;hire and Berk&s;hire.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Capt. Hunnewell, with a body of volun|teer hor&s;e, backed by the infantry under the com|mand of Maj. Woodbridge, made an excur&s;ion to Morri&s;&s;ania. The hor&s;e proceeded down between the Briti&s;h fort No. 8, and the cantonment of De|lancy's corps, and having turned the cantonments between day-break and &s;un-ri&s;e, they entered pell|mell. The enemy were completely &s;urpri&s;ed, and fled in every direction; &s;ome were cut down on the &s;pot, others &s;o badly wounded as not to be able to be removed. Some of the enemy availed them|&s;elves of po&s;itions where the hor&s;e could not a&s;&s;ail them, from whence they began to fire on the hor&s;e;
<PB N="330" REF="330">
this occa&s;ioned the firing of the alarm guns at No. 8. The hor&s;e having nearly accompli&s;hed their de&s;ign, moved off, taking the Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter road, on which Maj. Woodbridge had po&s;ted the infantry in am|bu&s;cade. Capt. Hunnewell had brought off one Subaltern and 20 men pri&s;oners, and 20 hor&s;es. The enemy in the vicinity collected a number of hor&s;e, backed by light-infantry, and pur&s;ued Capt. Hun|newell until he came to Maj. Woodbridge. The enemy were drawn into the ambu&s;cade, who made one or two di&s;charges on them, on which they broke and retired, but &s;oon returned to the charge; &s;kir|mi&s;hing en&s;ued, and continued to a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance. Of the Americans, two privates were kill|ed&mdash;Mr. Dyckman, one of the guides, a brave and active man, mortally wounded, and three privates &s;lightly wounded.</P>
<P>The enemy at New-York were now contemplat|ing means for their own defence, again&s;t the next campaign; and it was determined to open a canal and &s;trong lines from the Hud&s;on to the Ea&s;t River, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city. The canal was to be deep and wide; 2,000 men were employed on the works on one day, 300 of whom were inhabit|ants. The &s;ame number were to be furni&s;hed daily. The&s;e preparations were a defen&s;ive &s;hield for the time of approaching negociation; for from the de|bates and &s;peeches in the Briti&s;h Parliament, the olive-branch was evidently putting forth its buds.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Two &s;oldiers, belonging to the 6th Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts regiment, having &s;ome words re&s;pecting their me&s;s, one of them &s;truck the other with his fi&s;t a blow on the head, and killed him dead on the &s;pot. About the &s;ame time, an inhabitant, appre|hending that &s;ome &s;oldiers were about to rob his hen-roo&s;t, di&s;charged a mu&s;ket out of a window, by which a &s;oldier was killed.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="331">
13th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Lincoln, Secretary at War, ar|rived at the army, on his way to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>At this time it was learnt, that on the 13th of the preceding December there were &s;trong debates in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, re&s;pecting the car|rying on the war in America. When Sir James Lowther made a motion, that the mode which had been pur&s;ued was ineffectual, many Members &s;poke for and again&s;t the motion; when it was put, there was again&s;t the motion, 220; for it, 179; major|ity; 41.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Lieut. Harris, with &s;ix men belonging to Capt. Vermille's company of militia, having obtain|ed intelligence of a party of Delancy's corps being at a hou&s;e near Mile-Square, had the addre&s;s to &s;ur|pri&s;e the whole party, con&s;i&s;ting of 12, killed one and made four pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A duel was fought at We&s;t-Point, between Capt.&mdash;and Lieut.&mdash;,when the former was killed and the latter wounded: they fought with po&s;tols, at about ten feet di&s;tance. The Lieutenant ab&s;conded.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;News was received, that the I&s;lands of St. Chri&s;topher's and Nevis &s;urrendered to the arms of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, on the 12th of the pre|ceding February. The terms granted by the French commandants were truly noble, and reflect the high|e&s;t honour on them.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;About this time, putrid fevers were preva|lent among the American troops, and in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces proved mortal. About this time, an embarkation of about 800 troops took place at New-York; their de&s;tination not publickly known.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;The whole army were ordered to be in readine&s;s for in&s;tant action, or to march to &s;uch place or places, as might &s;tand in need of aid. An additional company was ordered to the lines, and
<PB N="332" REF="332">
another to Smith's Clove, for the &s;afety of the Com|mander in Chief, who was on his way from Philadel|phia to Newburgh, and was to pa&s;s the Clove, on the &s;ucceeding Saturday or Sunday. News was receiv|ed, that the citizens of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter had petitioned the King, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to relinqui&s;h the American war.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;Five de&s;erters came in from Arnold's corps, with their arms, &amp;c. complete. The enemy were bu&s;ily employed on their canal and lines: a number of heavy cannon had been put on board &s;hip, at New-York. About this time, the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers were but too &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Americans, at &s;ea. A &s;hip of 18 guns, had, for &s;ome time, taken a &s;ta|tion off Spitten-Devil Creek.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;His Excellency Gen. Wa&s;hington arrived at Newburgh; he had been ab&s;ent from the main army &s;ince the 19th of the preceding Augu&s;t, hav|ing &s;pent the winter at Philadelphia, after the capture of Earl Cornwallis.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2d.&mdash;Our General went up to Newburgh, to pay his re&s;pects to the Commander in Chief, where he dined, and returned at evening: Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton e&s;tabli&s;hed his quarters at Newburgh. On the night of the 1&s;t, a party of Capt. Pray's men, from the water-guard, being on &s;hore, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Hud&s;on, fell in with a party of our own militia, who, in the dark, attacked each other; four of the latter were wounded, and eleven (being the whole of the party) were taken pri&s;oners, before the mi&s;take was di&s;covered. An expre&s;s, on his way from St. John's to New-York, with &s;everal letters, one in characters, had been taken.</P>

<P>The Commander in Chief, having returned, and re&s;umed the command of the main army, pre&s;ents his thanks to Maj. Gen. Heath, and the troops which have been employed under his orders, for having pre&s;erved the important po&s;ts committed to his charge, and covered the country &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t the depredations of the enemy, during the ab&s;ence of the General.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>6th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief vi&s;ited We&s;t-Point, and reviewed the fir&s;t Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigade. On his arrival at the Point, he was &s;aluted by the di&s;charge of 13 cannon.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Four de&s;erters came in, three from the 42d Briti&s;h regiment, and a &s;eaman from the &s;hip Venger; this &s;hip, &s;tationed in the North River, mounted 24 guns, and had two gun-boats with her. The enemy continued at work on their canal and lines, which they were making very &s;trong. An incredible num|ber of fa&s;cines had been made, during the winter, on Long-I&s;land and Staten-I&s;land, &s;trongly bound with eight bands; the&s;e were placed in the face of the work, with five pickets in each fa&s;cine.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief reviewed the 3d Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigade and 10th regiment, and dined with our General. The &s;ame day, two de&s;erters came in from the &s;hip in the river. The &s;ame night, an armed brig, and three boats, full of men, came up the Hud&s;on, and came to anchor a little above the place where our guard-boats rendezvous, at Nyack; they were early di&s;covered, and the alarm given. The &s;oldiers landed at Haver&s;traw, about one o'clock on the morning of the 10th, and took 3 or 4 militia|men. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that their de&s;ign was to have taken our whale-boats: they were refugees and &s;ail|ors. Not knowing but this might have been a feint,
<PB N="334" REF="334">
to an attack on the lines, 200 men were detached for their &s;upport, if nece&s;&s;ary. The enemy returned down the river, in the afternoon, having, in addi|tion to the militia, above mentioned, taken two of Capt. Pray's men, who were out, burning coal, and two others who were over at Tarrytown, fi&s;hing, and de&s;troyed &s;ome &s;eines. It was learnt, from the north|ward, that the enemy were repairing and building boats at St. John's, and bringing up provi&s;ions to that place; this rendered it probable, that the ene|my would be trouble&s;ome in that quarter, the en&s;u|ing campaign. Several parties of Indians had been &s;kulking about, on the Mohawk River, had killed a &s;oldier and a lad, and had taken a &s;oldier pri&s;oner, and burnt a building.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from Robin&s;on's corps; they made their e&s;cape from Long-I&s;land, by cro&s;&s;ing the Sound in a canoe. They reported, that the enemy were under great apprehen&s;ions of an at|tack, and were making every preparation for defence; that 62,000 fa&s;cines had been made on Long-I&s;land, during the winter and &s;pring. A fleet of tran&s;ports had arrived at New-York, from Charle&s;ton. Lines were traced out on Long-I&s;land, from the great fort to the mar&s;h, near M'Gowen's mill-dam.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;It was learnt, that the enemy had laid an embargo on the &s;hipping at New-York. News was received, that Holland had formed an alliance with France, and that a Spani&s;h fleet had arrived in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;The General Officers, and officers com|manding brigades and regiments, met at our Gener|al's quarters, in con&s;equence of orders from the Commander in Chief, to give an opinion what mea&s;|ures ought to be adopted, in con&s;equence of the hor|rid and brutal murder of a Capt. Huddy, who had commanded a block-hou&s;e at Tom's River, in the Jer|fies,
<PB N="335" REF="335">
and had been taken pri&s;oner by the enemy, and carried to New-York, where he was clo&s;ely confined, under guard, and in the &s;ugar-hou&s;e, and on board a ve&s;&s;el, in irons, and then carried over to Bergen, in the Jer&s;ies, and hanged by the refugees, a Capt. Lip|pincot directing the execution. This was done, un|der the pretence that Capt. Huddy had been con|cerned in the death of one Philip White, although White was killed by the guard, from whom he en|deavoured to make his e&s;cape, and Capt. Huddy was at the &s;ame time a pri&s;oner with the enemy. Hud|dy was left hanging on a tree, with the following la|bel fa&s;tened on his brea&s;t: <HI>"Up goes Huddy for Philip White."</HI> This wanton and cruel act, &s;o exa&s;pe|rated the inhabitants of New-Jer&s;ey, that they drew up a petition, &s;igned by a va&s;t number of re&s;pecta|ble citizens, claiming of Gen. Wa&s;hington, as the Military Guardian of their country, the obtainment of ju&s;tice for this horrid act, or <HI>retaliation</HI> in ca&s;e ju&s;|tice was refu&s;ed. Indeed, painful as the idea of re|taliation mu&s;t be to the feelings of humanity, it &s;eemed now to be the only preventative of more hor|rid murders. Gen. Wa&s;hington, with his wonted prudence and talent for inve&s;tigation, free of all bias, ordered the officers to a&s;&s;emble as before mentioned, and directed our General to &s;tate to them the occa|&s;ion of their being convened, and then the following que&s;tions: "Shall there be retaliation for the murder of Capt. Huddy? On whom &s;hall it be inflicted? And how &s;hall the victim be de&s;ignated?" The offi|cers a&s;&s;embled were forbidden to conver&s;e on the que&s;tions &s;ubmitted to them, each one was to write his own opinion, &s;eal it up, and addre&s;s it to the Commander in Chief. By this mode of procedure, all the influence which &s;ome officers might have on others was prevented, and the &s;pontaneous feelings of every individual officer collected. Col. Hum|phries
<PB N="336" REF="336">
and Col. Trumbull, of the General's family, attended the Council, and every direction of the Commander in Chief was mo&s;t &s;trictly ob&s;erved. It was found that the officers were unanimous in their opinion, that retaliation ought to take place; that it &s;hould be inflicted on an officer of equal rank, viz. a Captain; not under convention or capitula|tion, but one who had &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; and that in de&s;ignating &s;uch an one, it &s;hould be done by lot. The Commander in Chief was plea&s;ed to approve of the opinion of the officers, and wrote to the Briti&s;h commander, demanding ju&s;tice for the wanton murder of Capt. Huddy; informing the Briti&s;h General at the &s;ame time, that if ju&s;tice was not obtained, retaliation would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly take place. At the &s;ame time, arrangements were put in train for retaliation; the names of &s;everal Briti&s;h officers, of equal rank and circum&s;tances, were thrown together, and a fair and impartial lot was drawn, when young Capt. <HI>A&s;gill</HI> was taken; he was of a noble family, his father was dead, and on him were the fond hopes of his mother, Lady A&s;gill, placed. Indeed a more affecting &s;cene than this can &s;carcely open; an innocent young man, doomed to &s;uffer for the wanton offence of another, which deed no doubt his &s;oul de&s;pi&s;ed; and the tender brea&s;t of a mother rent in twain on the fate of her darling &s;on. Nor were the feelings of the Great WASHINGTON unmoved on this occa&s;ion; they were too manife&s;t not to be ob&s;erved, and could on|ly be curbed by the invariable re&s;olution, in every exigence, to exhibit the admini&s;trator of ju&s;tice. It was months before this tragic bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;ed; and that the reader may have the whole narrative to|gether, it will be carried forward to &s;uch periods as will render a return back to the proper chain of events nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

Gen. Sir Guy Carleton, who had come into the command in chief at New-York, wrote to Gen. Wa&s;hington, a&s;&s;uring him of the fulle&s;t &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>Sir Guy ordered a Court-Martial for the trial of Capt. Lippencot, who was charged with the murder of Capt. Huddy. The Court-Martial had &s;et, and given in their proceedings to Gen.

<P>HAVING de&s;ired you to meet an officer from Sir Guy Carleton, for the purpo&s;e mentioned in your

appointment and authority, you will proceed to ex|ecute &s;aid bu&s;ine&s;s; in the cour&s;e of which, you may inform the officer you meet, that, as I have no con|nexion with, or control over any per&s;on in the line in which Mr. Smith walks; as the que&s;tion be|fore us is in my opinion purely of a military nature, and reduceable to this &s;ingle point, whether the per|petrator of the wanton and cruel murder of Huddy is to be given up, or a Briti&s;h officer to &s;uffer in his place, that I could &s;ee no propriety or nece&s;&s;ity in an interview with the Chief Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould find that the de&s;ign of Sir Guy Carleton is to procra&s;tinate this bu&s;ine&s;s, to envelope it in as much intricacy and difficulty as po&s;&s;ible, or that he means to ju&s;tify it by recrimination and law ca&s;es, thereby attempting to avert our purpo&s;es of retaliation, you may a&s;&s;ure him, (unle&s;s you &s;hall judge it expedient to leave me more at liberty) if not explicitly, at lea&s;t by &s;trong in&s;inuation, that he will mi&s;s his aim; and that my deliberate and di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate proceedings in this ca&s;e are intended to give him, as he now has had, full time to determine whether the guilty per&s;on or an innocent officer &s;hall be made the &s;ubject of retaliation.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P><PB N="342" REF="342">
Not long after, the proceedings of the Court-Martial on Capt. Lippencot, for the murder of Capt. Huddy were &s;ent out; Lippencot was acquitted by the Court, and it appeared that the Briti&s;h Com|manders in Chief, both Sir Henry Clinton, and Sir Guy Carleton, di&s;approved the act. It &s;eemed that a kind of Board of Directors who had a &s;ubordinate direction of the refugee operations, were &s;ome how concerned in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that <HI>argument</HI> and &s;ome <HI>artifice</HI> were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;mooth it over. How|ever, Gen. Wa&s;hington, painful as his ta&s;k was, was not to be diverted from ju&s;tice or retaliation; but execution was &s;u&s;pended. Lady A&s;gill, learning the unhappy &s;ituation of her darling &s;on, with much policy, and equal &s;ucce&s;s, applied to the Count de Vergennes, then Prime Mini&s;ter of France, who &s;pread the matter before the King and Queen: indeed it was a &s;ubject that needed no extra colouring to fix it on the mind of humanity. The King and Queen li&s;tened to the reque&s;t; and Congre&s;s was addre&s;&s;ed in a repre&s;entation, that the French, as well as Amer|ican arms, were victorious at York; and that the former &s;eemed to have &s;ome &s;hare in the pri&s;oners; and hinted that it would be plea&s;ing to the French Court, if young A&s;gill was pardoned&mdash;which Con|gre&s;s complied with: and although reparation for the wanton murder of Capt. Huddy was not fully obtained, yet it is highly probable, that the firm and determined conduct of Gen. Wa&s;hington, on the oc|ca&s;ion, put a final &s;top to any further repetition of the kind.</P>
<P>Sir Guy Carleton was probably the greate&s;t General which the Briti&s;h had in America, during the war; and it was fortunate for the Americans, that he was &s;o long kept within the limits of Canada. In him were combined many of tho&s;e great qualifications which form the General.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="343">
When Sir Guy vi&s;ited the American pri&s;oners in con&s;inement in Canada, he addre&s;&s;ed them with all the tenderne&s;s of a father; he ob&s;erved to the young pri&s;oners, that he did not blame them, it was the fault of the de&s;igning men of their country, that had led them into difficulty; that he would not hold them in con&s;inement, but would &s;end them home to their fathers and friends. See here the &s;oothing art, that could not fail to cool the ardour of the young warrior in the cau&s;e of his country.</P>
<P>To Gen. Waterbury of Connecticut, when he &s;hew him his commi&s;&s;ion, Sir Guy ob&s;erved&mdash;"Your com|mi&s;&s;ion is from the proper authority of your Colony; (Connectieut had not changed her form of govern|ment) you are no rebel, Sir; you &s;hall go home to your family."</P>
<P>Soon after Sir Guy Carleton came into the com|mand at New-York, a Connecticut &s;oldier, who had been a pri&s;oner, came out to our army, and reque&s;t|ed a pa&s;s to go home, informing that he had given a parole to Sir Guy, not to &s;erve again, during the war; but he was ordered to join his regiment, which di&s;appointed the &s;oldier exceedingly. Gen. Wa&s;h|ington ordered the Commi&s;&s;ary of Pri&s;oners to credit the Briti&s;h for one man exchanged; and informed Sir Guy that this practice would not be allowed. Ma|ny &s;oldiers were at that time very unea&s;y in the Amer|ican army&mdash;had a conduct of this &s;ort been allowed, many &s;oldiers on the out-po&s;ts and otherwi&s;e, might have gone to the enemy, have pretended they were taken, and have come out under parole, and have gone home, to the un&s;peakable injury of the army: but it was nipped in the bud&mdash;only one other hav|ing come out in the &s;ame way, before it was put a &s;top to.</P>
<P>We now return to take up the chain of events from which we digre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="344">
The 20th of April, two pri&s;oners of war, taken near King&s;treet, were &s;ent up by Major Oliver.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;A Serjeant-Major de&s;erted and came out; he reported that an enterprize was contemplating at New-York, and a number of large boats were col|lecting at Turtle Bay.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in from the Adamant man-of-war, of 50 guns, which lay in the Ea&s;t River, again&s;t New-York. Admiral Digby's flag was then hoi&s;ted on board the Centurion. The &s;eamen on board the &s;hips very &s;ickly.</P>
<P>The latter end of April, the Duke of Cumberland packet, Capt. Da&s;hwood, arrived at New-York, in &s;ix weeks from England, with the March mail: by which it was learnt, that the debates in the Briti&s;h Parliament on the American war, grew more and more intere&s;ting; that a motion had been made by Gen. Conway, for bringing in a bill, empowering the King to make peace with America.</P>
<P>The beginning of May, the Briti&s;h eruizers were very &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Americans; eleven &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els from Philadelphia were taken, and carried into New-York, with near 9,000 barrels of flour.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 4th.&mdash;This evening exhibited the mo&s;t ex|traordinary <HI>aurora borealis</HI> ever before &s;een by tho&s;e who ob&s;erved it.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;It was learnt, that the merchants of Edin|burg, at a meeting on the 7th of the preceding January, declared and publi&s;hed their &s;entiments and wi&s;hes for a peace with America, and a renewal of friend&s;hip. It was al&s;o further learnt, that it was the prevailing &s;en&s;e of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, as a fir&s;t &s;tep to an accommodation with America, to change the mode of carrying on the war, and to act only on the defen&s;ive, on the Continent; and that the per&s;on who &s;hould advi&s;e to offen&s;ive opera|tions again&s;t the Americans, &s;hould be con&s;idered as
<PB N="345" REF="345">
an enemy to the King and nation. At the &s;ame time, France and Holland appeared to be making great preparations for a vigorous campaign.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Symptoms of a dangerous mutiny were di&s;|covered in the Connecticut line; it had been con|ducted with &s;o much addre&s;s, as to have been nearly matured before it was divulged. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of real or &s;uppo&s;ed grievances, the &s;oldiers of the whole line had determined, at revelle the next morn|ing, to have marched from their cantonment with arms, &amp;c. complete, for Fi&s;hkill, were they were to take a number of field-pieces, and &s;uch ammunition and provi&s;ions as might be nece&s;&s;ary, and then pro|ceed to Hartford, and there demand of their new General A&s;&s;embly that ju&s;tice which they &s;uppo&s;ed was their due. Ju&s;t as the officers were going to bed, a faithful &s;oldier, who was waiter to an officer, came into his room, and told the officer that he could not go to re&s;t until he divulged to him an event which would a&s;&s;uredly take place the next morning, at break of day; and that every thing was then in readine&s;s for it&mdash;and laid open the whole &s;ecret. The matter was immediately communicated to the prin|cipal officers of the line, and &s;everal &s;oldiers were &s;eized and confined, and one &s;uffered. The whole de&s;ign was fru&s;trated. Mutiny is a mo&s;t horrid of|&s;ence in an army, which, without &s;trict order and di&s;cipline, is but a rope of &s;and. On the other hand, human nature can bear but to a certain degree, and no further: hence any trial of human nature, be|yond &s;uch a degree, is impolitic, and unju&s;tifiable. Of this line, it may with &s;trict ju&s;tice be &s;aid, that their whole conduct through the war was highly meritorious.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;A &s;top was put to the inoculation with the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="346">
8th.&mdash;A pri&s;oner was &s;ent up, and a de&s;erter came in.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;News was received, that there had been a total change of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, and that Fort St. Philip, and the whole i&s;land of Minorca, &s;urren|dered to the Spaniards, on the 6th of the preceding February, by capitulation.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;Eleven tru&s;ty Serjeants were &s;ent to Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, to march on the recruits to the army from that State.</P>
<P>17th.&mdash;Two de&s;erters came in, who reported that a packet had arrived at New-York, from England.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Near 100 old and decrepid &s;oldiers were collected from the different regiments, and many of them di&s;charged. About this time, a packet arrived at Bo&s;ton, in 25 days pa&s;&s;age from France; the let|ters were immediately forwarded to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;The 1&s;t Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigade was ordered to move out of its cantonment, and encamp near the German Huts.</P>
<P>The United States of Holland acknowledged the independence of the United States of America, the 28th of the preceding March.</P>
<P>There was a great talk of peace in New-York.</P>
<P>In the American army great preparations had for &s;ome time been making to celebrate the birth of the Dauphin of France. At lea&s;t 1,000 men a day were employed, under the direction of the engineers and other arti&s;ts, in con&s;tructing a mo&s;t &s;uperb <HI>arbor,</HI> decorated with every emblem and device, de&s;criptive of the occa&s;ion, and the alliance between France and America, which ingenuity could invent; and perhaps for any thing of the kind, con&s;tructed in the field, was never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;The birth of the Dauphin of France was celebrated by the American army. An elegant din|ner was provided, by order of the Commander in
<PB N="347" REF="347">
Chief; of which the officers of the army, and a great number of ladies and gentlemen, invited from the adjacent country, partook. Thirteen toa&s;ts were drank, announced by the di&s;charge of cannon. At evening there was a grand feu-de-joy, opened by the di&s;charge of 13 cannon, three times repeated. The feu-de-joy, being fired in the du&s;k, had a plea&s;ing appearance to the eye, as well as the ear; and was &s;o ordered for that purpo&s;e. The army was not formed in line, but each brigade was drawn up in front of its own cantonment, or camp, on both &s;ides of the river; and thus were in a circle of &s;ev|eral miles circumference, in the centre of which, the Commander in Chief, and the &s;pectators were plac|ed. After the feu-de-joy, there was an exhibition of fire-works, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 2d.&mdash;Information was received, that the i&s;l|and of New-Providence, and its dependencies, were taken by the Spaniards, on the 11th of the preced|ing May. The garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of about 200 men, were &s;ent to Europe. The new frigate South-Carolina, built in Europe, arrived about this time in the Delaware; &s;he was an exceeding fine &s;hip, mounting 28 42-pounders on one deck, and 12 12-pounders on her quarter and fore-ca&s;tle. She was commanded by Commodore Gillon.</P>
<P>There had been a bloody engagement in the We&s;t-Indies, the 12th of the preceding April, between the Count De Gra&s;&s;e and Admiral Rodney; but all the accounts had been very vague. The Briti&s;h now publi&s;hed their account, and that they took from the French, the Ville de Paris, of 110 guns, and 1300 men; Le Glorieux, Le Ce&s;ar, and Le Hector, of 74 guns each; and Le Ardent, of 64 guns, and &s;unk one &s;hip of the line. They acknowledged to have had 236 men killed, and 779 wounded; among whom were &s;everal officers. They al&s;o boa&s;ted of
<PB N="348" REF="348">
having obtained a very &s;ignal advantage in the Eu|ropean &s;eas, over Admiral Kempelfelt.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;It was reported, that a French fleet had been &s;een on the American coa&s;t. A fleet about this time &s;ailed from New-York, ea&s;tward, through the Sound, conjectured to be de&s;tined to Penob&s;cot. The brigades of the American army daily manoeu|vred, and fired to great acceptation.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The Briti&s;h had been removing a number of heavy cannon and ordnance &s;tores from their works at the north end of New-York i&s;land, and placing light pieces in the room of them. A num|ber of de&s;erters daily came in.</P>

<P>26th.&mdash;It was learnt from Canada, that &s;everal armed ve&s;&s;els and a number of batteaux, had come up Lake Champlain; there were probably about 300 men. A much larger force, (report &s;aid 3,000) was gone or going towards Lake Ontario, to e&s;tab|li&s;h a po&s;t at O&s;wego.</P>

<P>13th.&mdash;Two pri&s;oners of war were &s;ent up, and three German de&s;erters came in, and the next day a light dragoon, with his hor&s;e, &amp;c. complete. A|bout this time, the &s;outhern mail was taken, between Philadelphia and Morri&s;town.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;It was learnt, that on the 21&s;t of the pre|ceding May, Gen. Wayne obtained a con&s;iderable advantage over the enemy, with very little lo&s;s on his &s;ide, near Ogechee, in Georgia: the enemy re|tired into Savannah. About this time, a Corporal and 8 men de&s;erted from our block-hou&s;e, at Dobb's Ferry.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in. About this time, a fleet of about 40 &s;ail arrived at Sandy Hook, un|der convoy of two frigates; they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be from Ireland.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Three de&s;erters came in from the Briti&s;h
<PB N="350" REF="350">
grenadiers; two others de&s;erted at the &s;ame time, but had not got in. The &s;ame day, four de&s;erters came in from the Hu&s;&s;ar frigate, and the next day three &s;oldiers. At this time the cow thieves and refugees were lurking in the Highlands, and detach|ments were &s;ent out to patrol them.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Information was received, that a party of the enemy, to the number of 4 or 500, had appear|ed on the Mohawk River, advancing towards Fort Herkemer. They killed a continental &s;oldier.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington returned to Newburgh from Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2d.&mdash;The Briti&s;h May and June packets had arrived at New-York. Admiral Barrington had taken a French man-of-war, of 74 guns, and &s;everal tran&s;ports, de&s;tined for the Ea&s;t-Indies. The next day it was learnt, that a French fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of 12 or 13 &s;ail of the line, and 3 frigates, had ar|rived in the Che&s;apeak.</P>
<P>On the 29th ult. a bloody engagement took place off the Che&s;apeak, between the French frigate Am|azon, of 36 guns, and the Briti&s;h frigate Margaretta, which terminated in favour of the latter.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Information was received, that the Briti&s;h had evacuated Savannah in Georgia.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Four de&s;erters came in from the enemy.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;The pro&s;pect of an approaching peace brightened; Gen. Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby informed Gen. Wa&s;hington, that Mr. Gren|ville had gone over to France on the negociation for peace, and that the independence of America was to be acknowledged previous to, or as an opening of the negociation. The refugees at New-York were greatly alarmed at the pro&s;pect of peace. Sir Guy Carleton had notified the inhabitants to meet him; and, in Rivington's paper of the 7th, there appeared a proclamation, advi&s;ing the refugees to continue
<PB N="351" REF="351">
their loyalty; and make them&s;elves ea&s;y, until the event of the negociation was known.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;A large &s;tone magazine, capable of con|taining 1,000 barrels of gun-powder, was begun to be erected on Con&s;titution I&s;land; it was built upon the principles of Mon&s;ieur Vauban, and under the direction of Maj. Villefranche.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;It was learnt, that the French fleet, which had been at the Che&s;apeak, had arrived at Bo&s;ton. The Briti&s;h troops evacuated Savannah the 11th of July, leaving the town and works uninjured. Pre|vious to the evacuation, the refugees &s;ent out to Gen Wayne, to know if they might depend on pro|tection in their per&s;ons and property; they were an|&s;wered in the affirmative, until they were delivered over to the civil authority, who, they were inform|ed, mu&s;t decide on their ca&s;e. When the Briti&s;h left the town, near 200 of the inhabitants immedi|ately entered the American &s;ervice in the Georgia battalion.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;Three pri&s;oners of war were &s;ent up; they were taken near Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter. Several de&s;erters came in about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The light-infantry of the American army moved down, and encamped near Peek's Kill.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Knox was in the general or|ders appointed to the command of We&s;t-Point. The artillery, &s;appers and miners, 10th Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiment, and the corps of invalids, for the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>From the 25th to the 27th, inclu&s;ive, 7 de&s;erters came in; they reported that the &s;ick of the Briti&s;h army were ordered to be &s;ent on board the ho&s;pital &s;hips, and not to the ho&s;pitals on &s;hore. The heavy baggage was al&s;o ordered to be put on board the &s;hipping; the officers to retain on &s;hore no more than what was of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;An order of encampment and battle for
<PB N="352" REF="352">
the American army was publi&s;hed. The army was to encamp in one line, with a re&s;erve; the New-Jer&s;ey and New-York troops were to form a divi&s;ion under the command of Maj. Gen. St. Clair; the Connecticut troops, a divi&s;ion under Maj. Gen. M'Dougal; the&s;e two divi&s;ions to form the right wing, to be commanded by Maj. Gen. Gates: the New-Hamp&s;hire brigade and fir&s;t brigade of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, to form a divi&s;ion under the command of Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling; the 2d and 3d Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts brigades, a divi&s;ion under the command of Maj. Gen. Howe; the&s;e two divi&s;ions, forming the left wing, under the command of Maj. Gen. Heath. The 2d Connecticut and 3d Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigades to form the re&s;erve; and when the ground would admit, form at 200 paces in the rear of the army. Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling was ordered to Albany to take the command of that part of his divi&s;ion which was then in that quarter.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;As many of the army as could be carried in the boats, embarked at their re&s;pective brigade landings; and the whole of the boats being formed in order, fell down the river to Verplank's Point, where the troops di&s;embarked and encamped. They made a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, when in the boats and in motion. The remainder of the army march|ed down by land.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Information was received, that the Briti&s;h were on the eve of evacuating Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina. The &s;ea&s;on was remarkably dry, both to the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward; it was with difficulty that the army could obtain a &s;upply of wa|ter. About this time, an embarkation of He&s;&s;ian troops took place at New-York.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;There was a grand review and manoeuvre of the army, which gave great &s;atisfaction. The Ju|ly packet arrived at New-York about this time; it
<PB N="353" REF="353">
appeared that the Marquis of Rockingham had died, that Mr. Fox and Lord Cavendi&s;h had re&s;igned their places, and that Lord Shelburne was appointed one of the Secretaries of State.</P>
<P>14th.&mdash;The American army was under arms to receive Gen. Count de Rochambeau; after his re|ception, the army defiled before him, and returned to their re&s;pective encampments. The French ar|my was now arriving from the &s;outhward; they en|camped to the South of Peek's Kill as they arrived.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;The enemy made a grand forage near Volentine's Hill; Sir Guy Carleton was out in per|&s;on, as was the young Prince. The covering party, it was &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of 5 or 6,000 men; a number de&s;erted. The American army at this time was in great want of forage, occa&s;ioned by the dry &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;The la&s;t of the French army arrived.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington reviewed the French army; the troops made a fine appearance. A French frigate had been run on &s;hore in the Dela|ware, and taken by the enemy.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;The American army manoeuvred before the Commander in Chief, Gen. Rochambeau, and many other officers. The troops made a hand&s;ome appearance, and manoeuvred well.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;It was learnt, that the &s;hips-of-war and tran&s;ports, at New-York, were watering and prepar|ing for &s;ea, and a number of regiments were under orders for embarkation. A little before this time, Congre&s;s had authorized and empowered Gen. Wa&s;hington to adju&s;t and finally &s;ettle the accounts &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the United States and the Briti&s;h government, re&s;pecting the &s;upport of the pri&s;oners of war on both &s;ides; and to provide, by a general cartel, for their greater comfort and exchange, un|der the great &s;eal ratifying what he, the Com|mander in Chief of their army, &s;hould agree to.
<PB N="354" REF="354">
Gen. Wa&s;hington transferred this power to Major-Generals Heath and Knox, whom he appointed Commi&s;&s;ioners for the purpo&s;e, and in&s;tructed them not to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s the Briti&s;h Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were found to be equally empowered to bring the bu&s;ine&s;s to a final i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The time and place of meeting were agreed to by the two Commanders in Chief, and was to be on the 25th of September, at Tappan.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The American Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent down two of their Aids-de-Camp, to take up the nece&s;&s;ary quarters, and make other preparations; and a com|pany of light-infantry was ordered to Tappan, to fur|ni&s;h guards and centinels.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;The American Commi&s;&s;ioners embarked on board their barges, at King's Ferry, and fell down the river to Tappan Landing, where they ar|rived about 2 o'clock, P. M. In le&s;s than half an hour, the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, in two ve&s;&s;els, wear|ing flags, came up the river, and ca&s;t anchor off the Landing. The American Commi&s;&s;ioners waited at the &s;hore, and &s;ent off their barges to aid, in bring|ing the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners on &s;hore, the river be|ing at that time very rough: on their reaching the &s;hore, it was found that Lieut. Gen. Campbell and the Hon. Mr. Elliot, who had been Lieut. Governor of New-York, were the Commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of the Briti&s;h. The whole dined together, an ele|gant dinner having been ordered by the American Commi&s;&s;ioners, and politene&s;s and great &s;ociability took place; and a mutual arrangment for the daily &s;upport of the table, was agreed on, as it was ex|pected that the bu&s;ine&s;s would not be completed in le&s;s than three or four weeks, if the whole object was adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;The Commi&s;&s;ioners interchanged copies of their re&s;pective powers; the&s;e were to be con&s;ider|ed
<PB N="355" REF="355">
until the next day, when an&s;wers were to be giv|en in writing, whether the powers were &s;atisfactory on both &s;ides. On examining the powers, given to the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, it appeared that their do|ings would not be conclu&s;ive, until confirmed, and were very &s;hort of tho&s;e held by the American Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who&s;e agreement and &s;ignature were to be final.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The American Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;tated to the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, that the powers with which they were ve&s;ted were inadequate to effect the expectations of the government of the United States, and that therefore the negociation mu&s;t be broken off. Of the great difference of the powers, the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners were fully convinced. The American Commi&s;&s;ioners thought it to be their duty, when they gave their note of objections to the Briti&s;h delegated powers, to hand with it a very pointed prote&s;t, in behalf of the United States, again&s;t that conduct, on the part of the Briti&s;h, which had &s;o long delayed the &s;ettlement of the accounts for the &s;upport of the pri&s;oners of war, which were in the power of the United States. The Commi&s;&s;aries of Pri&s;oners, on both &s;ides, were pre&s;ent, to pre&s;ent and &s;upport their re&s;pective accounts; and a &s;ettlement would not only have been ju&s;t, but al&s;o very intere&s;t|ing to the United States.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;About 12 o'clock, at noon, the Commi&s;|&s;ioners parted with the &s;ame politene&s;s and good-hu|mour with which they met, and which had invaria|bly continued during the time they were together. Our General &s;ent orders to the commanding officer at Dobb's Ferry, to permit the Briti&s;h flags to pa&s;s down the river; and the American Commi&s;&s;ioners returned to camp. The day before, (the 27th) Gen. Wa&s;hington, covered by the dragoons and light-in|fantry, reconnoitred the grounds on the ea&s;t &s;ide of
<PB N="356" REF="356">
the river, below the White-Plains; and the 29th, about noon, returned to camp.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 3d.&mdash;It was learnt, that the enemy had evacuated Lloyd's Neck, and de&s;troyed their works at that place: their works at Bergen Point, in the Jer&s;ies, had been de&s;troyed before that time.</P>
<P>5th.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Gates arrived at camp. At this time, the hor&s;es of the army were &s;uffering for want of forage.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from the &s;outh|ward, that on the 27th of Augu&s;t, Col. Laurens was killed, in a &s;kirmi&s;h with the enemy: the lo&s;s of this brave young officer was much regretted. The enemy, previous to their leaving Charle&s;ton, de&s;ired to purcha&s;e &s;ome provi&s;ions; and Gen. Le&s;&s;ie had intimated to Gen. Greene, that if this could not be permitted, he mu&s;t take the provi&s;ions by force. The former being denied, the latter was attempted, and Col. Laurens fell; 24 or 25 others were killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oners, and one howitzer fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Maj. Gen. Lee had died, a little before, at Philadelphia; he had ju&s;t before &s;old his e&s;tate, in Virginia, for &pound;6,100 &s;terling.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The weather beginning to grow cold and blowing, all the bowers (which were numerous and very falutary, during the hot &s;ea&s;on) were ordered to be pulled down and removed, to prevent accidents by fire, and to admit the benefit of the &s;un.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Europe, by the arrival of a ve&s;&s;el in 34 days from Am&s;terdam, that the negociation for peace was going on, and that additional Mini&s;ters and Envoys had gone to at|tend; that the combined fleets were all in port; that the &s;iege of Gibraltar was continued; and that there had been an ob&s;tinate engagement in the Ea&s;t-
<PB N="357" REF="357">
Indies, between the French and Engli&s;h fleets, in which both fleets had &s;uffered much, but no &s;hips were taken by either &s;ide. The in&s;urrection in South-America had been quelled.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;A new contract, for &s;upplying the army with provi&s;ions, under Me&s;&s;rs. Wad&s;worth and Car|ter, took place.</P>
<P>16th.&mdash;A grand manoeuvre was performed by eight picked battalions, preparatory to a grand re|view, which was to be the next day.</P>
<P>On the 19th (&s;everal preceding days having been &s;tormy) the grand manoeuvre was performed, by the eight picked battalions. The evolutions and firings were performed with regularity and exactne&s;s, much to the credit of the troops, and general &s;atisfaction of the numerous &s;pectators of the American and French armies.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;The Secretary at War arrived at camp. The enemy were demoli&s;hing their works at No. 8, Morri&s;&s;ania. Intelligence was received, that the be|&s;iegers of Gibraltar had made a nearer approach to the place, and were playing upon it with 200 pieces of artillery.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the French army mov|ed ea&s;tward; they were to halt at Hartford, in Con|necticut, where the whole were to rendezvous. The American army was put under orders, to be ready to move on the &s;horte&s;t notice. The Augu&s;t pack|et, from England, arrived at New-York the day be|fore.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;The whole American army manoeuvred before the Hon. the Secretary at War. The Com|mander in Chief, in the orders of the day, expre&s;&s;ed his own, as well as the Secretary at War's fulle&s;t approbation.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;At reveile, the left wing of the American army, under the command of our General, &s;truck
<PB N="358" REF="358">
their tents, and marched from the encampment, as far as the wood, near the north redoubt, in the Highlands, where they remained during the night; the day and night were rainy, and the troops had no covering but the heavens.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;The troops cro&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on in boats to We&s;t-Point, the whole having cro&s;&s;ed by half pa&s;t 12 o'clock. In the afternoon, the troops took up their line of march, and a&s;cended Butter-Hill, a te|dious march, and halted and pa&s;&s;ed the night on the northern de&s;cent of the hill, in the open field.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;At 7 o'clock, A. M. the troops re&s;umed their march from Butter-Hill, and reached the ground on which they were to build their huts, in New-Wind&s;or, at about half pa&s;t 10 o'clock, A. M. Upon this ground, and its vicinity, the army pa&s;&s;ed the en&s;uing winter. The cantonment, for its nature and kind, was regular and beautiful. Upon an em|inence, the troops erected a building, hand&s;omely fini&s;hed, with a &s;pacious hall, &s;ufficient to contain a brigade of troops on Lord's days, for public wor&s;hip, with an orche&s;tra at one end; the vault of the hall was arched; at each end of the hall were two rooms, conveniently &s;ituated for the i&s;&s;uing of the general orders, for the &s;itting of Boards of Officers, Courts Martial, &amp;c. and an office and &s;tore for the Quarter-Ma&s;ter and Commi&s;&s;ary's departments. On the top was a cupola and flag-&s;taff, on which a flag was hoi&s;ted occa&s;ionally, for &s;ignals, &amp;c. In this can|tonment the army &s;pent the winter very comfortably, and it proved to be their la&s;t winter-quarters.</P>
<P>30th.&mdash;It was learnt, that on the 26th or 27th, fourteen Briti&s;h men-of-war, of the line, one 44 gun &s;hip, &s;even frigates, three large tran&s;ports, and ten or twelve brigs and &s;chooners, failed from New-York, it was conjectured for the We&s;t-Indies. They were ob&s;erved to &s;ail nearer under Long-I&s;land than
<PB N="359" REF="359">
u&s;ual, and came too, near the place where Gen. Howe landed in the year 1776, where it was con|jectured troops now embarked.</P>
<P>On the 7th of the preceding Augu&s;t, Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions, directing the Secretary at War, on or before the 1&s;t day of January following, to cau&s;e the non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates, belonging to the lines of the &s;everal States, to be arranged in &s;uch manner as to form complete regiments, agreea|ble to the acts of Congre&s;s of the 3d and 21&s;t of Oc|tober, 1780, of regiments of not le&s;s than 500 rank and file, the junior regiments to be drafted to fill the &s;enior regiments. The regiments &s;o formed, to be completely officered; the officers to agree and de|termine who &s;hould &s;tay in &s;ervice; or if this could not be effected by agreement, the juniors who were &s;upernumerary of each grade were to retire, retain|ing their rank, and be entitled to the emoluments, to which the officers were entitled, who retired un|der the re&s;olutions of the 3d and 21&s;t of October, 1780. In con&s;equence of the&s;e re&s;olutions, the Commander in Chief, on this day, (30th of Oct.) ordered the regiments of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts line to be reduced to 8 regiments, of 500 rank and file each, or as near as could be to that number; and the Connecticut line to 3 regiments of &s;imilar &s;trength, with 3 Field Officers, 9 Captains, 19 Subalterns, 1 Surgeon, and 1 Mate each; and the regiments were formed accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;It was learnt from Europe, that the Royal George, a fir&s;t rate Engli&s;h man-of-war, of 110 guns, had been over&s;et near Spithead, by a &s;udden flaw of wind, as &s;he lay heeled to repair a leak on the other &s;ide; that &s;he &s;unk in about 8 minutes, having on board 12 or 1300 &s;ouls, about 900 of whom peri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="360">
5th.&mdash;Our General left the army, and commenc|ed his journey to the ea&s;tward, and arrived at his hou&s;e in Roxbury on the 11th.</P>
<P>12th.&mdash;There was a tran&s;it of Mercury over the north-we&s;t limb of the &s;un's di&s;k. The preceding week, one of the French men-of-war, in Port&s;mouth harbour, (N. H.) was &s;truck by lightning, and her forema&s;t damaged. The French army were now on their march towards Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The America, a fine new 74 gun &s;hip, the fir&s;t of her rate built in the United States, and which had not long before been pre&s;ented by Congre&s;s to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, was launched at Port&s;mouth on Tue&s;day the 5th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;The field artillery of the French army reached Bo&s;ton. The &s;ame day it was reported, that the Briti&s;h troops had left Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;The French di&s;charged their artillery hor&s;es, to the number of &s;everal hundreds.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Spain, that the Briti&s;h had relieved Gibraltar, and taken a Span|i&s;h 70 gun &s;hip; &s;everal of their gun-boats were al&s;o de&s;troyed. Had Spain long before this given over the &s;iege of Gibraltar, and employed her naval and land forces again&s;t the Briti&s;h in &s;ome quarter more vulnerable, &s;olid advantages might have accrued, much money and many lives have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;General Thank&s;giving throughout the United States. The French fleet, under the com|mand of the Marquis de Vaudreuil, was at this time in Nanta&s;ket Road, except a few &s;hips which were at Port&s;mouth, New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 2d.&mdash;Maj. Gen. Baron Viominel, com|mander of the French army, (Count de Rochambeau not coming this way) arrived at Bo&s;ton from Prov|idence. The troops were coming forward in divi|&s;ions,
<PB N="361" REF="361">
at one day's march di&s;tance from each other. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion arrived at Bo&s;ton on the 5th, in the morning.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;In the morning, a &s;hip lying in Bo&s;ton harbour, laden with ma&s;ts, de&s;tined to the We&s;t-Indies, by &s;ome accident took fire, and burnt down to the water's edge; the lo&s;s was very con&s;iderable. Advice was received from Europe, that the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, for &s;ettling peace, were &s;itting at Paris; that matters were in forwardne&s;s; &s;everal articles had been agreed to, &amp;c. A reinforcement of French &s;hips and troops had arrived in the We&s;t-Indies from France. This day the la&s;t divi&s;ion of the French troops reached Bo&s;ton. The&s;e troops embarked on board the men-of-war, were much crowded, and in danger of growing &s;ickly, if continued long on board. About this time, the American officers had been very unea&s;y re&s;pecting their great arrears of pay, &amp;c.; and &s;oon after addre&s;&s;ed Congre&s;s on the &s;ubject, and appointed a Committee from the army to pre&s;ent their petition and &s;upport it.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;The town of Bo&s;ton pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the French General and officers.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;The French fleet had all fallen down below the Ca&s;tle, and were in readine&s;s to proceed to &s;ea. The markets were at this time extremely high; flour at 8 and &s;ome at 9 dollars per hundred; butter was &s;old at <HI>2s. 4d.</HI> per pound, &amp;c.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's fleet, under the command of the Marquis de Vaudreuil, came to &s;ail in King and Nanta&s;ket Roads, and went out to &s;ea, having the army under the command of Gen. Viominel on board. The fleet was fir&s;t to &s;tand to the northward, until it was joined by the &s;hips from Port&s;mouth; they were then to tack and &s;tand to the &s;outhward, and take with them the Fanta&s;que,
<PB N="362" REF="362">
armed en-flute from Rhode-I&s;land, and proceed to the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;It was learnt, that near 3,000 refugee in|habitants had gone from Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina, to Jamaica, and about the &s;ame number to Augu&s;|tine. The exorbitant prices of provi&s;ions fell imme|diately after the &s;ailing of the French fleet.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;Authentic accounts were received from Europe, that Mon&s;ieur de la Perreu&s;e, in the &s;hip Sceptre, with two frigates, had returned to France, from a &s;ucce&s;sful enterprize again&s;t the Briti&s;h &s;et|tlements in Hud&s;on's Bay, having entirely de&s;troy|ed the e&s;tabli&s;hments and property of the Engli&s;h on that coa&s;t, e&s;timating the damage at ten millions of livres.</P>
<P>31&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h homeward-bound We&s;t-India fleet, on their way to England, met a violent &s;torm, in which two 74 gun &s;hips, the Ramillies and the Centaur, were &s;aid to have foundered; and that a number of the mer|chantmen had been taken by French and Ameri|can cruizers, and carried into France&mdash;that four pri|zes had been taken by the American frigate Alli|ance, Capt. Barry, having 1,200 hhds. of &s;ugar, and 400 hhds. of rum on board.</P>
<P>1783. <HI>January</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a terrible fire happened in the city of Con&s;tan|tinople, in the month of the preceding Augu&s;t, in which a large part of the city was con&s;umed, and about 5,000 lives lo&s;t. The fire was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been kindled by the malefactors, in &s;ix differ|ent places.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Great-Brit|ain had acknowledged the Independence of the Uni|ted States, collectively and &s;everally; and that a commi&s;&s;ion had been &s;ent to Mr. O&s;wald, one of
<PB N="363" REF="363">
the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris, to treat with the American Commi&s;&s;ioners accordingly.</P>
<P>Some further accounts of the terrible fire in Con|&s;tantinople, &s;tated that near 200,000 inhabitants were burnt out of their habitations&mdash;that the fire continued to burn &s;ixty-two hours, and at &s;ome times with a front a mile in width.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Charle&s;|ton man-of-war, belonging to the State of South-Carolina, a remarkable fine &s;hip, commanded by Commodore Gillon, was taken by the Briti&s;h, and carried into New-York.</P>
<P>In this month, the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in their &s;everal religious &s;ocieties, made voluntary contributions to the inhabitants of the town of Charle&s;town, to enable them to rebuild a meeting|hou&s;e, in the room of that which was de&s;troyed by fire, by the Briti&s;h troops, during the battle of Bun|ker's Hill, on the 17th of June, 1775.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;News was received, that Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling had lately died at Albany; he was a brave officer in the American army.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that the Briti&s;h troops left Charle&s;ton, in South-Carolina, the 14th of the preceding December, and the Bar the 17th; and that Gen. Greene had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city. It had been previou&s;ly agreed, that the Amer|icans would not mole&s;t the Briti&s;h in quitting the place; and on their part, they were not to injure the city.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;It was learnt, that Gen. Clarke had been very &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Shawane&s;e Indians, and had de&s;troyed a number of their towns. From Eu|rope it was learnt, that although there was the great|e&s;t pro&s;pect of peace, yet all the powers at war were &s;training every nerve to be prepared for the opening of the next campaign. The damage &s;u&s;tained by
<PB N="364" REF="364">
the Briti&s;h homeward bound We&s;t-India fleet, was greater than at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed; among the di&s;abled &s;hips was the Ville de Paris, of 110 guns, and &s;ev|eral others.</P>
<P>29th.&mdash;A prize &s;hip, taken by Capt. Manly, arriv|ed in Bo&s;ton harbour, having about 1,800 barrels of provi&s;ions on board.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 5th.&mdash;News was received, that the Brit|i&s;h had reinforced the garri&s;on at Penob&s;cot&mdash;that the whole garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of nearly 900 men&mdash;that a further reinforcement was expected&mdash;and that the Briti&s;h were endeavouring to extend their influence in that quarter.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that a number of loyali&s;ts had gone from New-York to Nova-Scotia; that Gov. Franklin, in England, had written to his friends in New-York, that peace would certainly take place. About this time, the articles of a treaty of amity and commerce, between the United States of America and Holland, was publi&s;hed by Congre&s;s. In the month of the preceding December, Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed a &s;pirited re&s;olution, re&s;pecting the conduct of the government of Vermont; and about this time, the Council of Vermont pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s a re|mon&s;trance again&s;t the re&s;olution, as interfering with their internal police.</P>
<P>About this time, Gen. Wa&s;hington and Gen. Sir Guy Carleton had an interview on the lines of the two armies.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that Don Sola|no, with ten &s;ail of Spani&s;h men-of-war, had arrived at the Havannah, and that the Count D'E&s;taing had arrived, with a French fleet, at Martinico; that an attack on the i&s;land of Jamaica was &s;oon expected to take place; in con&s;equence of which, &s;even Briti&s;h regiments were to go from New-York to the We&s;t-Indies. The refugees at New-York were &s;elling off
<PB N="365" REF="365">
their effects at auction, and preparing for a &s;udden removal to Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;The Briti&s;h King's &s;peech, to his Parlia|ment, appeared in a hand-bill. The &s;peech breath|ed reconciliation throughout. The King informed his Parliament, that he had gone the utmo&s;t lengths the power granted to him would allow; and that he hoped &s;oon to lay before them the articles of peace, which were in great forwardne&s;s, and &s;uch as he ap|prehended they would approve. That he hoped the two countries would &s;till be in friend&s;hip,&mdash;that re|ligion, language, intere&s;t, &amp;c. urged this,&mdash;that he devoutly prayed Great-Britain might not experience any of tho&s;e calamities, which might be feared from &s;uch a di&s;memberment of the Empire; and then extends &s;ome compa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions to America. Alas, O King! it might have been happy for both countries, if a due con&s;ideration had been early ex|erci&s;ed; then might much blood and much trea&s;ure have been &s;aved. Let it be a warning to other na|tions, to be wi&s;e and ju&s;t! Nature will have her own way, and do her own work in her own time. Amer|ica of cour&s;e would be independent and &s;ove|reign; but a mi&s;taken policy in Great-Britain, hurried on an event to her own lo&s;s, long before nature had ripened it for her own con&s;ummation. The public expectation now was high, and the pe|riod when peace &s;hould be announced &s;uppo&s;ed to be even at the door, and divers premature accounts were at different times circulated.</P>
<P>25th.&mdash;It was learnt, that Lieut. Col. Barber, of the New-Jer&s;ey line, had a little before been killed, together with his hor&s;e, near the army, by the un|expected fall of a tree, which a &s;oldier was cutting. By this event a brave officer and valuable citizen was lo&s;t, who had frequently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in action; his fall, therefore, in this manner, and
<PB N="366" REF="366">
at the very gra&s;p of the harve&s;t of his toils, were rendered the more affecting.</P>
<P>27th.&mdash;Intelligence was received from Virginia, that the Hou&s;e of Delegates of that State had rec|ommended to their con&s;tituents, not to choo&s;e in|to places of power and tru&s;t, men who had not been attached to the cau&s;e of liberty, and only &s;uch as had given early and decided proof of their friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>28th.&mdash;It was found, that the Briti&s;h cruizers, from New-York, had lately taken a number of A|merican ve&s;&s;els, among them &s;everal from Bo&s;ton to Virginia.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 3d.&mdash;Accounts were received from Eu|rope, that in an a&s;&s;ault made by the Spani&s;h troops on the garri&s;on of Gibraltar, in the month of Sep|tember, the be&s;ieged, with their cannon loaded with grape-&s;hot, made great havock among the a&s;|&s;ailants, but that this did not check their ardor; but that upon a near approach to the walls, they were &s;topped, and thrown into great confu&s;ion by &s;everal engines, throwing &s;calding water upon them. Some were &s;calded almo&s;t to death, and others had their eyes put out&mdash;a new mode of defence, but a pow|erful one.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;Intelligence was received, that not long be|fore, the French frigate Sibill had been taken by &s;ome of the Briti&s;h cruizers, and carried into New-York.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;It was learnt from Philadelphia, that the Wa&s;hington packet, Capt. Barney, had arrived at that place from L'Orient in France, which place &s;he left the 17th of January. The public di&s;patches brought by this ve&s;&s;el, although they did not announce a peace to be concluded, yet informed that the nego|ciations were going on; every thing was &s;ettled be|tween America and Great-Britain, and matters look|ed

favourable towards France; but difficulties were &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Great-Britain, Spain and Holland. Several of the out-lines of the articles of the treaty, between Great-Britain and the United States of America, were publi&s;hed, and in general were thought to be favourable to the latter. The &s;ame packet brought di&s;patches for Gen. Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby, which were forwarded to New-York.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;It was learnt, that a great unea&s;ine&s;s had di&s;covered it&s;elf in the American army, on account of the great arrears of pay which was due, and &s;ome doubting apprehen&s;ions as to the real intention of the public to fulfil their promi&s;es to the army, and in particular that of half pay. An anonymous notifi|cation, and two addre&s;&s;es to the officers, made their appearance about ten days before, couched in very firm and decided language; the&s;e produced an ad|dre&s;s from the Commander in Chief, a meeting of the officers, a repre&s;entation to Congre&s;s, and their re&s;olutions re&s;pecting the army at that time.</P>
<P>The evening of the 28th, a letter was received from Philadelphia, purporting that a ve&s;&s;el had ar|rived there from Europe, with the intelligence, that the preliminary articles of peace were &s;igned on the 20th of the preceding January. Ho&s;tilities were to cea&s;e in Europe the 20th of February, and in Amer|ica on the 20th of this month. The public di&s;|patches had not now arrived, but were momently expected.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2d.&mdash;It was learnt, that a very valuable prize was carried into Salem.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;Our General &s;at out from his hou&s;e in Rox|bury, and arrived at the head-quarters of the Amer|ican army at Newburgh, on Hud&s;on's River, on the 14th, in the forenoon.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="368">
On the 16th, in the general orders of the day, our General was directed to take the immediate command of the army, during the ab&s;ence of Maj. Gen. Gates. Congre&s;s had publi&s;hed their procla|mation &s;u&s;pending ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>18th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief addre&s;&s;ed the army on the happy ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities as follows:</P>
<Q><P>The Commander in Chief orders the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities between the United States of America and the King of Great-Britain, to be publickly pro|claimed to-morrow at 12 o'clock, at the New Build|ing; and that the Proclamation which will be com|municated herewith, be read to-morrow evening, at the head of every regiment and corps of the army; after which, the chaplains, with the &s;everal brigades, will render thanks to Almighty God for all his mer|cies, particularly for his over-ruling the wrath of man to his own glory, and cau&s;ing the rage of war to cea&s;e among&s;t the nations.</P><P>Although the Proclamation before alluded to, extends only to the prohibition of ho&s;tilities, and not to the annunciation of a general peace, yet it mu&s;t afford the mo&s;t rational and &s;incere &s;atisfaction to every benevolent mind, as it puts a period to a long and doubtful conte&s;t&mdash;&s;tops the effu&s;ion of human blood&mdash;opens the pro&s;pect to a more &s;plendid &s;cene&mdash;and, like another morning-&s;tar, promi&s;es the approach of a brighter day than hath hitherto illu|minated this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere!

<P>In the afternoon of the 18th, a &s;chooner,&mdash;Cot|tle, ma&s;ter, from Nantucket, with fi&s;h, oil, rum, &amp;c. came up the Hud&s;on, to Newburgh. This was the fir&s;t American ve&s;&s;el which had come up the river, &s;ince the Briti&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New-York, in the year 1776.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;At noon, the Proclamation of the Congre&s;s, for a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, was publi&s;hed at the door of the New Building, followed by three huzzas; after which, a prayer was made by the Rev. Mr. Ganno, and an anthem <HI>(Independence,</HI> from Billings) was performed by vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. The &s;ame day, Gen. Wa&s;hington went for Ringwood, to meet the Secretary at War, on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of importance.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;At evening, the Commander in Chief re|turned to head-quarters.</P>
<P>21&s;t.&mdash;Permi&s;&s;ion was given for &s;uch per&s;ons as might choo&s;e it, to go to New-York, with provi&s;ions, &amp;c. A ve&s;&s;el was loading with flour, to go down the river; and one laden with rum, porter, chee&s;e, beef, &amp;c. &amp;c. came up from New-York. Thus, as we have &s;een how the rage of war came on, we now &s;ee how by degrees that rage &s;ub&s;ided, until the <HI>olive</HI> &s;prang up and progre&s;&s;ed to full bloom.</P>
<P>24th.&mdash;It was learnt from Europe, that on the 5th of February, preceding the Bedford, Capt. Morris, made entry at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in London, being the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el that had arrived in the river, belong|ing to the United States.</P>
<P>26th.&mdash;It was learnt that the refugees were em|barking, in order to leave New-York; and many tran&s;ports were falling down to the watering-place.
<PB N="372" REF="372">
About this time, Congre&s;s recommended an impo&s;t duty to the &s;everal States.</P>

<P>2d.&mdash;The next morning, the Commander in Chief was to go down the river, to Dobb's Ferry, to meet Gen. Sir Guy Carleton. Four companies of light|infantry marched this morning for that place, to do the duty of guards. Sir Guy was to come up the river in a frigate.</P>
<P>3d.&mdash;In the forenoon, the Commander in Chief, and Gov. Clinton, with their &s;uites, &amp;c. went down the river.</P>
<P>7th.&mdash;It was learnt that &s;everal ve&s;&s;els had arriv|ed at Bo&s;ton, from Europe, Halifax, &amp;c. with mer|chandize; in con&s;equence of which, the price of goods had much fallen, and the inhabitants of the ea&s;tern States were fitting out a great number of fi&s;h|ing ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;It was &s;aid that 11,644 American pri&s;oners had died, during the war, in the pri&s;ons, and on board the pri&s;on-&s;hips, at New-York: a &s;urpri&s;ing number, and evidences that if their treatment was not &s;evere, they were too much crowded, or not properly attended to, in other re&s;pects. Tho&s;e who have &s;een, know, and others can ea&s;ily con|ceive, that where men are clo&s;ely confined in great

numbers, in prifon-&s;hips, or in gaols, that without frequent airing and clean&s;ing, the air in &s;uch places becomes putrid and poi&s;onous, and produces almo&s;t certain death. How much care then ought to be exerci&s;ed by every humane commander, in the ap|pointment of provo&s;t officers, to be a&s;&s;ured that tho&s;e whom they appoint are not only firm and re&s;|olute, (nece&s;&s;ary qualifications in &s;uch officers) but that they al&s;o are <HI>con&s;iderate</HI> and <HI>humane;</HI> and that &s;uch commanders them&s;elves take care to know, and if nece&s;&s;ary, correct any abu&s;es which may exi&s;t. Such conduct towards the confined and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, would add a laurel to the hero's brow, equal to the triumphs of victory, and more la&s;ting: for if the merciful man be merciful even to his bea&s;t, how much more ought a great and brave man to feel for the unfortunate of his own &s;pecies!</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;At evening, the Commander in Chief re|turned to head-quarters, having had an interview with Gen. Sir Guy Carleton.</P>
<P>15th.&mdash;The Commander in Chief went for Pough|keep&s;ie. A letter from Gen. Sir Guy Carleton, to Gov. Clinton, had rendered an interview between the Governor and the Commander in Chief ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>

Next to the angui&s;h which the pro&s;pect of our own wretchedne&s;s excites in our brea&s;ts, is the pain which ari&s;es from a knowledge of your anxiety on account of tho&s;e men who have been the &s;harers of your fortunes, and have had the hon|our of being your companions through the various vici&s;&s;itudes of the war. Nothing, therefore, but ne|ce&s;&s;ity, could induce us to a repre&s;entation which we know mu&s;t give you concern.</P>
<P>Your Excellency has &s;o intimate a knowledge of the condition of the army, as to render a particu|lar delineation unnece&s;&s;ary.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I make a reply to the &s;ubject of the addre&s;s of the Generals and Officers, commanding the regiments and corps of this army, pre&s;ented by your&s;elf, ye&s;terday, I entreat that tho&s;e gentlemen will accept my warme&s;t acknowledgment for the con|fidence they have been plea&s;ed to repo&s;e in me; they may be a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall never be abu&s;ed: and I beg they will be per&s;uaded, that as no man can po&s;&s;ibly be better acquainted than I am, with the pa&s;t merits and &s;ervices of the army, &s;o no one can po&s;&s;ibly be more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with their pre&s;ent ineligible &s;ituation, feel a keener &s;en&s;ibility at their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or more ardently de&s;ire to alleviate or remove them. But it would be unnece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, to enter into a detail of what I have done, and what I am &s;till at|tempting to do, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the accompli&s;h|ment of this intere&s;ting purpo&s;e. Let it be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, I do not yet de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s; for I am perfectly convinced that the States cannot, without involving them&s;elves in national bankruptcy and ruin, refu&s;e to comply with the requi&s;itions of Con|gre&s;s; who, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, have done every thing in their power to obtain ample and com|plete ju&s;tice for the army; and who&s;e great object in the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure undoubtedly was, by a reduc|tion of expen&s;e, to enable the Financier to make the three months' payment to the army, which on all hands has been agreed to be ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. To explain this matter, I beg leave to in&s;ert an extract of a letter from the Superintend|ant of Finance, dated the 29th ult.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="378">
It is now a month &s;ince the Committee conferred with me on that &s;ubject, and I then told them no payment could be made to the army, but by means of a paper anticipation; and unle&s;s our expenditures were immediately and con&s;iderably reduced, even that could not be done. Our expenditures have neverthele&s;s been continued, and our revenues le&s;&s;en, the States growing daily more and more remi&s;s in their collections. The con&s;equence is, that I cannot make payment in the manner fir&s;t intended; the notes i&s;&s;ued for this purpo&s;e would have been paya|ble at two, four, and &s;ix months from the date, but at pre&s;ent they will be at &s;ix months, and even that will &s;oon become impracticable, unle&s;s our expen&s;es be immediately curtailed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall cau&s;e &s;uch notes to be i&s;&s;ued for three months' pay to the army; and I mu&s;t entreat, Sir, that every influence be u&s;ed with the States to ab&s;orb them, together with my other engagements, by tax|ation.</P>
<P>Three days ago, a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched by me to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of forwarding the&s;e notes with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>Under this &s;tate of circum&s;tances, I need &s;carcely add, that the expen&s;e of every day in feeding the whole army, will increa&s;e very con&s;iderably the ina|bility of the public to di&s;charge the debts already incurred, at lea&s;t for a con&s;iderable time to come.</P>
<P>Although the officers of the army very well know my official &s;ituation, that I am only a &s;ervant of the public, and that it is not for me to di&s;pen&s;e with orders, which it is my duty to carry into exe|cution; yet, as furloughs, in all &s;ervices, are con&s;id|ered as a matter of indulgence and not of compul&s;ion&mdash;as Congre&s;s, I am per&s;uaded, entertain the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition towards the army&mdash;and, as I apprehend, in a very &s;hort time the two principal articles of com|plaint

will be removed&mdash;I &s;hall not he&s;itate to comply with the wi&s;hes of the army, under the&s;e re&s;ervations only, that officers &s;ufficient to conduct the men who choo&s;e to receive furloughs, will attend them, either on furlough or by detachment. The propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of this mea&s;ure mu&s;t be obvious to all; it need not, therefore, be enforced; and with regard to the non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates, &s;uch as from a peculiarity of circum&s;tances wi&s;h not to receive furloughs at this time, will give in their names by 12 o'clock to-morrow, to the command|ing officers of their regiments, that on a report to the Adjutant-General, an equal number of men, engaged for three years, may be furloughed, which will make the &s;aving of expen&s;es exactly the &s;ame to the public.</P>
<P>I cannot but hope the notes will &s;oon arrive, and that the &s;ettlement of accounts may be completed, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Pay-Ma&s;ters, in a very few days. In the mean time, I &s;hall have the honour of laying the &s;entiments of the Generals and Officers, commanding regiments and corps, before Congre&s;s; they are expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a decent, candid and affecting manner, that I am certain every mark of attention will be paid to them.</P>

<P>The two preceding papers were enclo&s;ed in the following letter from the Commander in Chief to his Excellency the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="380" REF="380">
<OPENER><DATELINE>HEAD-QUARTERS, NEWBURGH, <DATE><HI>June</HI> 7, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to enclo&s;e to your Excellency the copy of an addre&s;s to me, from the Generals and Officers, commanding regiments and corps, together with my an&s;wer to it. The&s;e enclo&s;ures will explain the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which re&s;ulted from the mea&s;ures now carrying into execution, in con&s;equence of the re&s;o|lution of the 26th of May; but the &s;en&s;ibility occa|&s;ioned by a parting &s;cene, under &s;uch peculiar cir|cum&s;tances, will not admit of de&s;cription!</P>
<P>The two &s;ubjects of complaint with the army, appear to be the delay of the three months' payment which had been expected, and the want of a &s;ettle|ment of accounts. I have thought my&s;elf authorized to a&s;&s;ure them, Congre&s;s had and would attend par|ticularly to their grievances; and have made &s;ome little variation re&s;pecting furloughs, from what was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed; the Secretary at War will be able to explain the rea&s;on and propriety of this alteration.</P>
<P>While I con&s;ider it a tribute of ju&s;tice, on this occa&s;ion, to mention the temperate and orderly be|haviour of the whole army, and particularly the accommodating &s;pirit of the officers, in arranging them&s;elves to the command of the battalions which will be compo&s;ed of the three years' men; permit me to recall to mind all their, former &s;ufferings and merits, and to recommend their rea&s;onable reque&s;ts to the early and favourable notice of Congre&s;s.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>A little before this time, the officers of the army beginning to realize that the di&s;&s;olution of the army was drawing nigh, and wi&s;hing to perpetu|ate that friend&s;hip which numerous hard&s;hips, &s;uf|ferings, and common dangers had in&s;pired in their brea&s;ts,&mdash;re&s;olved to form them&s;elves into a Society,
<PB N="381" REF="381">
by the name of the <HI>Cincinnati.</HI> Several meetings were had for the purpo&s;e, and an In&s;titution was di|ge&s;ted and completed; and although our General pre&s;ided at one of the meetings, and cheerfully, at the reque&s;t of his brother officers, tran&s;mitted copies of the In&s;titution, covered by a letter, to the officer commanding the &s;outhern army, and to the &s;enior officers of the re&s;pective State lines, from Penn&s;yl|vania to Georgia&mdash;yet he had &s;erious objections to the In&s;titution, as it &s;tood, and refu&s;ed for &s;ome time to &s;ign it. He wi&s;hed, as much as any one in the ar|my, to perpetuate the happy friend&s;hip cemented in the brea&s;ts of the officers by an eight years common danger and &s;ufferings; but he thought this would be be&s;t done, by &s;imply forming a Society, to meet an|nually in their re&s;pective States, for the purpo&s;e of a &s;ocial hour, and to brighten the chain of friend|&s;hip, with a fund for the relief of the unfortunate of their brethren; but he was oppo&s;ed to any idea of any thing that had any re&s;emblance of an order, or any in&s;ignia or badge of di&s;tinction, <HI>a&s;&s;erting</HI> that it would only &s;erve to mark them in an unfavourable light with their fellow-citizens: but the prevailing opinion of the officers was otherwi&s;e. Our General was finally induced to &s;ign the In&s;titution, from the following con&s;ideration&mdash;(but not until all the offi|cers were appointed, and he nearly ready to leave the army) conver&s;ing with an officer of rank, who was of the &s;ame opinion with him, they parted in the re&s;olution not to &s;ign the In&s;titution; but the next morning, the officer called upon him, and ob|&s;erved, that one con&s;ideration, not before mentioned, had occurred to him, viz. that it might happen in the days of their po&s;terity, in ca&s;e they did not &s;ign, that the de&s;cendant of one who was a member might hap|pen to fall in company with the de&s;cendant of one who was not; that the latter, on ob&s;erving the badge,
<PB N="382" REF="382">
might inquire what it was, and what its intention? upon its being an&s;wered, that it was the in&s;ignia of a Society, of which his ance&s;tor, who &s;erved in the American army, during the revolution, was a mem|ber&mdash;the other might reply, my ance&s;tor too &s;erv|ed during that war, but I never heard any thing of &s;uch a badge in our family; to which it might probably be an&s;wered, it is likely your ance&s;tor was guilty of &s;ome mi&s;conduct, which deprived him of it. Upon this, our General broke out&mdash;"I &s;ee it, I &s;ee it, and &s;purn the idea;" which led him to &s;ign the general In&s;titution: and he &s;ub&s;cribed to the State fund, 166 dollars, being one month's pay, as was &s;tipulated in the In&s;titution. He however never met with the Society, although no one has cheri&s;hed a warmer affection for every member of the army. After the revolution in France, finding that the in|&s;ignias of di&s;tinctions were doing away, it led him <HI>anew</HI> to review the di&s;tinction which the <HI>badge</HI> of the Society to which he belonged, if not in fact, yet in appearance &s;eemed to exhibit, and brought to mind all his former objections, which induced him to write to the Secretary-General to era&s;e his name from the In&s;titution; but that his &s;ub&s;cription to the fund &s;hould remain, &s;o long as it was applied to the purpo&s;e for which it was given&mdash;the relief of the un|fortunate.</P>
<P>6th.&mdash;In the forenoon, the Jer&s;ey line marched from the cantonment to their own State, where they were to be di&s;banded. The &s;ame day, the fir&s;t New-York regiment made a pre&s;ent of their &s;tand|ards and band to Governor Clinton; they were e&s;corted to Poughkeep&s;ie by the light-infantry com|pany of the regiment.</P>
<P>8th.&mdash;The men for the war, belonging to the Maryland, New-Jer&s;ey, New-York, and New-Hamp|&s;hire lines, having marched from the cantonment, a
<PB N="383" REF="383">
divi&s;ion of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts men marched on this day.</P>
<P>9th.&mdash;A divi&s;ion of the Suffolk and Worce&s;ter furloughed men, marched for their own State, and &s;o on, a divi&s;ion each day, until the whole had marched.</P>
<P>10th.&mdash;Our General was General of the Day. In the after orders of the Commander in Chief on this day, it was expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;"The &s;trength of the army in this cantonment being con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the number of men lately furloughed, the order of the 16th of April, directing a General, Field-Offi|cers, and Quarter-Ma&s;ter to be of the day, and al&s;o a regiment to parade every day for duty, is di&s;pen&s;ed with. For the pre&s;ent, there will be one Field-Offi|cer, and an Adjutant of the day; and the guards only will form on the grand parade at 9 o'clock in the morning." It is here a little remarkable, that our General, by who&s;e orders and under who&s;e di|rection the fir&s;t guard in the American war mounted at the foot of Pro&s;pect Hill, on the evening of the 19th of April, 1775, after the battle of that day, &s;hould happen, in the cour&s;e of &s;ervice, to be the la&s;t General of the day in the American main army, on the 10th of June, 1783, to in&s;pect, turn off, and vi&s;it the guards. At the fir&s;t period, the roads were full of <HI>militia,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing towards Bo&s;ton, to commence and pro&s;ecute a dubious war; they were now filled with <HI>veteran &s;oldiers,</HI> covered with laurels, returning from the field to their peaceful abodes.</P>
<P>11th.&mdash;About 2 o'clock, P. M. the wind fre&s;hen|ed from the we&s;t; there were &s;everal thunder-&s;how|ers, with large hail-&s;tones, &s;ome of which were &s;up|po&s;ed to be two inches long. The lightning &s;truck the flag-&s;taff of the New Building, entered the hou&s;e, and ran down the &s;outh &s;ide of it, doing &s;ome dam|age, and &s;tunning &s;everal &s;oldiers near the door. In
<PB N="384" REF="384">
the general orders of this day, it was announced, that the <HI>levees</HI> were to be di&s;continued.</P>
<P>13th.&mdash;The men who had enli&s;ted for 3 years, and for &s;horter periods not expired, were formed, tho&s;e belonging to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts into 4 regiments, and were to be commanded by Colonels Michael Jack&s;on, Henry Jack&s;on, and Jo&s;eph Vo&s;e, and Lieut. Col. Commandant Sprout. On the morning of the 16th, the&s;e regiments incorporated, and were form|ed into two brigades, the one commanded by Brig. Gen. Patter&s;on, the other by Brig. Gen. Greaton.</P>
<P>19th.&mdash;A number of officers of the army, viz. &s;everal general officers, and officers commanding regiments and corps, met at the New Building, and elected his Excellency Gen. Wa&s;hington, Pre&s;ident General; Gen. M'Dougal, Trea&s;urer; and Gen. Knox, Secretary, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> to the Society of the Cincinnati.</P>
<P>20th.&mdash;The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State Society of the Cincinnati met, and made choice of Maj. Gen. Lin|coln for their Pre&s;ident; Maj. Gen. Knox, Vice-Pre&s;|ident; Col. John Brooks, Secretary; Col. Henry Jack|&s;on, Trea&s;urer; and Capt. Heywood, A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Trea&s;|urer. The &s;ame day, the troops at the cantonment were put under orders, to be ready to march for We&s;t-Point on the &s;ucceeding Monday.</P>
<P>22d.&mdash;Our General i&s;&s;ued his la&s;t order, which fini&s;hed as follows: "The long wi&s;hed for period having arrived, when the din of war cea&s;es, the olive|branch of peace is di&s;played, the toils and fatigues of the field are drawing to a clo&s;e, a part of the army have already mingled with their fellow-citizens, and others will probably ere long join them&mdash;Maj. Gen. Heath being about to leave the army, and this being the la&s;t opportunity which will remain in his power, to expre&s;s that affection for his brother officers and &s;oldiers, which more than eight years &s;ervice has e&s;|tabli&s;hed
<PB N="385" REF="385">
in his brea&s;t, he cannot depart without leaving his be&s;t wi&s;hes for the health, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of tho&s;e, who&s;e lot it is a little longer to continue in the field&mdash;invoke every ble&s;&s;ing on them, and bid them an affectionate farewel."</P>
<P>23d.&mdash;The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiments marched to We&s;t-Point.</P>
<P>The morning of the 24th, our General was to commence his journey homeward; but the Com|mander in Chief wi&s;hed him not to proceed until the afternoon. On his arrival at head-quarters, Col-Humphries, one of the Aids-de-Camp of the Com|mander in Chief, gave him a &s;ealed letter, ob&s;erving to him to read it at his lei&s;ure. On opening it, in General Wa&s;hington's own hand-writing it was as follows:</P>

<P>In the afternoon, the general officers were in Council at head-quarters, in con&s;equence of an ex|pre&s;s from Philadelphia. Four or five hundred men of the Penn&s;ylvania line, of tho&s;e who had been fur|loughed on or about the 20th, grew very mutinous, refu&s;ed to obey orders, entered the city of Philadel|phia, &s;eized &s;ome public &s;tores, &s;urrounded the place where Congre&s;s and the Supreme Court of the State were &s;itting, and made &s;everal demands, and occa|&s;ioned &s;ome con&s;ternation, which cau&s;ed a repre&s;ent|ation to the Commander in Chief. The continent|al regiments were to be put under marching orders immediately. It was judged inexpedient to call out the militia.</P>
<P>At about 5 o'clock, P. M. our General took his leave of his beloved General, and commenced his journey for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and arrived at his hou&s;e in Roxbury on the fir&s;t day of July, at 2 o'clock, P. M. where he gave evidence that an eight years military life had not dive&s;ted him of the feelings or man|ners of a citizen.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30th.&mdash;It was learnt, that the definitive treaty of peace was &s;igned the 3d of the preceding September; and that di&s;patches were &s;ent off to the different Courts in Europe, to America, the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, &amp;c. with an account of this happy event.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, by a proclamation which bore date the 18th of this month, di&s;charged from further &s;ervice
<PB N="387" REF="387">
&s;uch &s;oldiers as were engaged for the war, and offi|cers who were ab&s;ent by derangement and furlough. The di&s;charges to take place the 3d of November, en&s;uing.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 2d.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington i&s;&s;ued his la&s;t and farewel orders to the federal armies, taking an affectionate leave of them, and giving them his be&s;t advice.</P>
<P>4th.&mdash;Gen. Wa&s;hington, by proclamation, in com|pliance with a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s of the 29th of the preceding October, di&s;charged all the troops in the &s;ervice of the United States, that were then in Penn|&s;ylvania, or to the &s;outhward thereof, except the garri&s;on of Fort Pitt.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h troops having left New-York, on the 25th of November, at one o'clock, P. M. a detach|ment of the American army took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city; after which, his Excellency General Wa&s;h|ington, and Governor Clinton, made their public entry, properly e&s;corted, &amp;c. The Governor gave a public dinner at Frances' tavern.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 2d.&mdash;There was a grand exhibition of fire-works in celebration of the peace, at the bowl|ing-green, in Broadway. The magnificent fire|works far exceeded any before exhibited in the United States.</P>
<P>On the 4th, at noon, a great number of American officers of di&s;tinction met at Frances' tavern, to take their leave of their great Commander, Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, who, on filling a gla&s;s of wine, addre&s;&s;ed his brave compatriots as follows:&mdash;</P>
<Q>With an heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you&mdash;I mo&s;t devoutly wi&s;h that your latter days may be as pro&s;perous and happy, as your former ones have been glorious and honourable.</Q>
<P><PB N="388" REF="388">
The di&s;&s;olution of the American army (excepting a &s;mall detachment of artillery and of infantry) took place a few days after; and General WASHINGTON, ere long, retired to his &s;eat at Mount Vernon, cov|ered with every laurel with which his own victorious conduct, and a grateful country, could adorn him; and with the applau&s;e of an admiring world.</P>
