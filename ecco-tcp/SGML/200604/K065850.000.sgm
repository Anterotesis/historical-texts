<HEAD>CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
DESIGN
OF THE
SIXTH Book of the AENEID.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE Allegorical Interpretation which
the Bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter has given of
the Sixth Book of the Aeneid, &s;eems
to have been very favourably received by the
Public. Many writers, both at home and
abroad, have mentioned it with approbation,
or at lea&s;t with e&s;teem; and I have more than
once heard it alledged, in the conver&s;ation of
&s;cholars, as an ingenious improvement on the
plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of Virgil. As &s;uch,
it is not unde&s;erving of the notice of a candid
critic; nor can the enquiry be void of enter|tainment,
whil&s;t Virgil is our con&s;tant theme.
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Whatever may be the fortune of the chace,
we are &s;ure it will lead us through plea&s;ant
pro&s;pects and a fine country.</P>
<P>That I may e&s;cape the imputation as well
as the danger of mi&s;repre&s;enting his Lord&s;hip's
Hypothe&s;is, I &s;hall expo&s;e it in his own words.
<Q REND="inline">The purpo&s;e of this Di&s;cour&s;e is to &s;hew that
Aeneas's adventure to the INFERNAL SHADES,
is no other than a figurative de&s;cription of
his INITIATION INTO THE MYSTERIES; and
particularly a very exact one of the SPECTA|CLES
of the ELEUSINIAN<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Warburton's Di&s;&s;ertation, &amp;c. in the third volume of Mr. Warton's Virgil. I &s;hall quote indifferently that Di&s;&s;ertation or the Divine Legation it&s;elf.</NOTE>.</Q> This gene|ral
notion is &s;upported with &s;ingular ingenuity,
dre&s;&s;ed up with an ea&s;y yet pompous di&s;play of
Learning, and delivered in a &s;tyle much fitter
for the Hierophant of Eleu&s;is, than for a Mo|dern
Critic, who is ob&s;erving a remote object
through the medium of a glimmering and
doubtful light: <Q>Ibant ob&s;curi, &s;ol&acirc; &s;ub nocte, per umbram.</Q></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip naturally enough pur&s;ues two
different methods which unite, as he apprehends,
in the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. From general prin|ciples
peculiar to him&s;elf, he infers the pro|priety
<PB N="3" REF="5">
and even nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a De&s;cription
of the My&s;teries; and from a compari&s;on of
particular circum&s;tances he labours to prove
that Virgil has actually introduced it into the
Aeneid. Each of the&s;e methods &s;hall be con&s;i|dered
&s;eparately.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>As the learned Prelate's Opinions branch
them&s;elves out into luxuriant Sy&s;tems, it is not
ea&s;y to re&s;ume them in a few words. I &s;hall,
however, attempt to give a &s;hort idea of tho&s;e
general principles, which occupy, I know not
how, &s;o great a &s;hare of the <HI>Divine Legation
of Mo&s;es demon&s;trated.</HI></P>
<P><Q TYPE="inline">The whole Sy&s;tem of Pagani&s;m, of which
the My&s;teries were an e&s;&s;ential part, was
in&s;tituted by the Antient Lawgivers for the
&s;upport and benefit of Society. The my|&s;teries
them&s;elves were a School of Morality
and Religion, in which the vanity of Po|lythei&s;m<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">At lea&s;t of the vulgar polythei&s;m, by revealing that the <HI>Dii Majorum Gentium</HI> had been mere mortals.</NOTE>, and the Unity of the Fir&s;t
Cau&s;e, were revealed to the Initiated. Virgil,
who intended his immortal Poem for a Re|public
in action, as tho&s;e of Plato and
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Tully were in precept, could not avoid di&s;|playing
this fir&s;t and noble&s;t art of Govern|ment.
His perfect Law-giver mu&s;t be
initiated, as the antient Founders of States
had been before him; and as Augu&s;tus him|&s;elf
was many ages afterwards.</Q></P>
<P>What a crowd of natural reflections mu&s;t
occur to an unbla&s;&s;ed mind! Was the civil ma|gi&s;trate
the mover of the whole machine; the
&s;ole contriver, or at lea&s;t the &s;ole &s;upport of
Religion? Were antient laws ALWAYS de&s;igned
for the benefit of the people, and NEVER for the
private intere&s;t of the Lawgiver? Could the
fir&s;t fathers of rude &s;ocieties in&s;truct their new|made
&s;ubjects in philo&s;ophy as well as in agri|culture?
Did they all agree, in Britain as in
Egypt, in Per&s;ia as in Greece, to found the&s;e
&s;ecret &s;chools on the &s;ame common principle;
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted near eighteen hundred years at
Eleu&s;is <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">From their in&s;titution, 1399 years before the Chri&s;tian aera (Marm. Arundel. Ep. 14), till their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, towards the end of the fourth century.</NOTE> in its primaeval purity? Can the&s;e
things be? Yes, replies the learned prelate;
they are: <Q REND="inline">Egypt was the my&s;terious mother
of Religion and Policy; and the arts of
Egypt were diffu&s;ed with her colonies over
the antient World. Inachus carried the My|&s;teries
<PB N="5" REF="7">
into Greece, Zoroa&s;ter into Per&s;ia<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Though I hate to be po&s;itive, yet I would almo&s;t venture to affirm, that Zorca&s;ter's connection with Egypt is no where to be found, except in the <HI>D. L.</HI></NOTE>
&amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;I retire from &s;o wide a field,
in which it would be ea&s;y for me to lo&s;e both
my&s;elf and my adver&s;ary. THE ANTIENT
WORLD, EIGHTEEN CENTURIES, and FOUR HUN|DRED
AUTHORS GENUINE AND APOCRYPHAL<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>See a li&s;t of four hundred Authors, quoted, &amp;c. in the <HI>D. L.</HI> from St. Au&s;tin and Ari&s;totle, down to Scarron and Rabelais. Among&s;t the&s;e authors we may ob&s;erve Sanchoniatho, Orpheus, Zaleucus, Charondas, the Oracles of Prophry, and the Hi&s;tory of Jeffrey of Monmouth.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop has entered the li&s;ts with the tremendous Bentley, who treated the laws of Zaleucus and Charondas as the forgeries of a &s;ophi&s;t. A whole &s;ection of mi&s;takes or mi&s;repre&s;entations is devoted to this controver&s;y: But Bentley is no more, and W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n may &s;leep in peace.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, di&s;turb his repo&s;e, by a&s;king him on what authority he &s;uppo&s;es that the old language of the Twelve Tables was altered for the conveniency of &s;uc|ceeding ages. The fragments of tho&s;e laws, collected by Lip&s;ius, Sylburgius, &amp;c. bear the &s;tamp of the mo&s;t remote antiquity. Lip&s;ius him&s;elf (tom. i. p. 206.) was highly de|lighted with tho&s;e <HI>Antiqui&s;&s;ima Verba:</HI> But what is much more deci&s;ive, Horace (L. II. Ep. i. Ver. 23), Seneca (Epi&s;tol. 114), and Aulus Gellius (XX. 1), rank tho&s;e laws among&s;t the olde&s;t remains of the Latin tongue. Their ob&s;olete language was admired by the lawyers, ridiculed by the wits, and pleaded by the friends of antiquity as an ex|cu&s;e for the frequent ob&s;curities of that code.</P>
<P>Had an adver&s;ary to the <HI>Divine Legation</HI> been guilty of this mi&s;take, I am afraid it would have been &s;tyled an <HI>egregious blunder.</HI></P></NOTE>

would, under tolerable management, furni&s;h
&s;ome volumes of controver&s;y; and &s;ince I have
peru&s;ed the two thou&s;and and fourteen pages
of the unfini&s;hed <HI>Legation,</HI> I have le&s;s inclina|tion
than ever to &s;pin out volumes of laborious
trifles.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, venture to point out a fact,
not very agreeable to the favourite notion, that
Pagani&s;m was entirely the Religion of the ma|gi&s;trate.
The Oracles were not le&s;s antient, nor
le&s;s venerable than the My&s;teries. Every diffi|culty,
religious or civil, was &s;ubmitted to the
deci&s;ion of tho&s;e infallible tribunals. During
&s;everal ages no war could be undertaken, no
colony founded, without the &s;anction of the
Delphic Oracle; the fir&s;t and mo&s;t celebrated
among&s;t &s;everal hundred others<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See Vandale de Oraculis, p. 559. That valuable book contains whatever can now be known of Oracles. I have borrowed his facts; and could with great ea&s;e have borrowed his quotations.</NOTE>. Here
then we might expect to perceive the directing
hand of the magi&s;trate. Yet when we &s;tudy
their hi&s;tory with attention, in&s;tead of the Alli|ance
between Church and State, we can only
di&s;cover the antient Alliance between the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
Avarice of the Prie&s;t and the Credulity of the
People.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am very apt to con&s;i|der
the My&s;teries in the &s;ame light as the
Oracles. An intimate connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
them<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><P>The prophet Alexander, who&s;e arts are &s;o admirably laid open by Lucian, in&s;tituted his Oracle and his My&s;teries as regular parts of the &s;ame plan. It is here we may &s;ay, with the learned Catholic, <Q REND="inline">Les nouveaux Saints me font douter des Anciens.</Q></P></NOTE>: Both were preceded and ac|companied
with fa&s;ts, &s;acrifices, and lu&s;tra|tions;

&s;ounds: But the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential preparation for
the ASPIRANT, was a general confe&s;&s;ion of his
pa&s;t life, which was exacted of him by the Prie&s;t.
In return for this implicit confidence, the Hiero|phant
conferred on the Initiated a &s;acred cha|racter;
and promi&s;ed them a peculiar place of
happine&s;s in the Ely&s;ian fields, whil&s;t the &s;ouls
of the Profane (however virtuous they had
been) were wallowing in the mire<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">See Diogen. Laert. vi. 39. &amp; Menag. ad loc.</NOTE>. Nor
did the Prie&s;ts of the My&s;teries neglect to re|commend
to the brethren a &s;pirit of friend&s;hip,
and the love of virtue; &s;o plea&s;ing even to the
mo&s;t corrupt minds, and &s;o requi&s;ite to render
any &s;ociety re&s;pectable in its own eyes. Of all
<PB N="8" REF="10">
the&s;e religious &s;ocieties, that of Eleu&s;is was the
mo&s;t illu&s;trious. From being peculiar to the
inhabitants of Attica, it became at la&s;t common
to the whole Pagan world. Indeed, I &s;hould
&s;u&s;pect that it was much indebted to the genius
of the Athenian writers, who be&s;towed fame and
dignity on whatever had the lea&s;t connection
with their country; nor am I &s;urpri&s;ed that
Cicero and Atticus, who were both initiated,
&s;hould expre&s;s them&s;elves with enthu&s;ia&s;m, when
they &s;peak of the &s;acred rites of their beloved
Athens.</P>
<P>But our curio&s;ity is yet un&s;atisfied; we would
pre&s;s forwards into the &s;anctuary; and are eager
to learn, WHAT was the SECRET which was reveal|ed
to the Initiated, and to them alone. Many of
the Profane, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lei&s;ure and ingenuity,
haved tried to gue&s;s, what has been &s;o religiou&s;ly
concealed. The SECRET of each is curious and
philo&s;ophical; for as &s;oon as we attempt this
Enquiry, the honour of the My&s;teries becomes
our own<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall &s;um them up in a curious pa&s;&s;age of the cele|brated Freret. <Q REND="inline">Les &s;ectes philo&s;ophiques cherchoient &agrave; diviner le Dogme cach&eacute; &s;ous le voile des Ceremonies; &amp; tachoient de le ramener chacune &agrave; leur doctrine.

MODERN FORGERY of &s;ome Jewi&s;h or Chri&s;tian
Impo&s;tor. Had I delivered THESE TWO DIS|COVERIES,
with an air of Confidence and Tri|umph,
I &s;hould be &s;till more mortified.</P>
<P>After all, as I am not apt to give the name
of Demon&s;tration to what is mere conjecture,
his Lord&s;hip may take advantage of my Scep|tici&s;m,
and &s;till affirm, that his favourite My&s;te|ries
were Schools of Thei&s;m, in&s;tituted by the
Lawgiver. Yet unle&s;s Aeneas is the Lawgiver
of Virgil's Republic, he has no more bu&s;ine&s;s
with the My&s;teries of Athens, than with the
laws of Sparta. We will, therefore, reflect a mo|ment
on the true nature and plan of the Aeneid.</P>
<P>An Epic Fable mu&s;t be important as well as
intere&s;ting: Great actions, great virtues, and
<PB N="11" REF="13">
great di&s;tre&s;&s;es, are the peculiar province of
Heroic Poetry. This rule &s;eems to have been
dictated by nature and experience, and is very
different from tho&s;e chains in which Genius has
been bound by artificial Critici&s;m. The im|portance
I &s;peak of, is not indeed always de|pendant
on the rank or names of the Per&s;onages.
Columbus, exploring a new world with three
&s;loops and ninety &s;ailors, is a Hero worthy of
the Epic Mu&s;e; yet our imagination would be
much more &s;trongly affected by the image of a
virtuous Prince &s;aved from the ruins of his
country, and conducting his faithful followers
through unknown &s;eas and through ho&s;tile lands.
Such is the Hero of the Aeneid. But his pecu|liar
&s;ituation &s;ugge&s;ted other beauties to the
Poet, who had an opportunity of adorning his
&s;ubject with whatever was mo&s;t plea&s;ing in Gre|cian
fable, or mo&s;t illu&s;trious in Roman hi&s;|tory.
Aeneas had fought under the walls of
Ilium; and conducted to the Banks of the
Tyber a Colony from which Rome claimed her
origin.</P>
<P>The character of the Hero is expre&s;&s;ed by one
of his friends in a few words; and, tho' drawn
by a friend, does not &s;eem to be flattered: <Q><L>Rex erat Aeneas nobis; quo ju&s;tior alter,</L>
<L>Nec pietate fecit, nec bello major &amp; armis<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, i. 548.</NOTE>.</L></Q><PB N="12" REF="14">
The&s;e three virtues, of JUSTICE, of PIETY, and
of VALOR, are finely &s;upported throughout the
Poem<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">M. de Voltaire condemns the latter part of the Aeneid, as far inferior in fire and &s;pirit to the former. As quoted in the <HI>Legation,</HI> he thinks that Virgil
<Q>&mdash;s'&eacute;pui&s;e avec Didon &amp; <HI>rate</HI> &agrave; la fin Lavinie;</Q> a pretty odd quotation for a Bi&s;hop; but I mo&s;t &s;incerely hope, that neither his Lord&s;hip nor Mrs. W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n are ac|quainted with the true meaning of the word <HI>Rater.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall here mention one in&s;tance of the
Hero's ju&s;tice, which has been le&s;s noticed than
its &s;ingularity &s;eems to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>After Evander had entertained his Gue&s;ts,
with a &s;ublime &s;implicity, he lamented, that his
age and want of power made him a very u&s;ele&s;s
Ally. However, he points out auxiliaries and
a cau&s;e worthy of a Hero. The Etru&s;cans, tired
out with the repeated tyrannies of Mezentius,
had driven that monarch from his throne, and
reduced him to implore the protection of Tur|nus.
Un&s;atisfied with freedom, the Etru&s;cans
called loudly for revenge; and, in the Poet's
opinion, revenge was ju&s;tice. <Q><L>Ergo omnis <HI>furiis</HI> &s;urrexit Etruria <HI>ju&s;tis</HI>:</L>
<L><HI>Regem</HI> ad <HI>&s;upplicum</HI> prae&s;enti Marte repo&s;|cunt<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, viii. 495.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
Aeneas, with the approbation of Gods and men,
accepts the command of the&s;e brave rebels, and
<PB N="13" REF="15">
puni&s;hes the Tyrant with the death he &s;o well
de&s;erved. The conduct of Aeneas and the
Etru&s;cans may, in point of ju&s;tice, &s;eem doubt|ful
to many; the &s;entiments of the Poet cannot
appear equivocal to any one. Milton him&s;elf,
I mean the Milton of the Commonwealth, could
not have a&s;&s;erted with more energy the daring
preten&s;ions of the people, to puni&s;h as well as
to re&s;i&s;t a Tyrant. Such opinions, publi&s;hed by
a writer, whom we are taught to con&s;ider as the
creature of Augu&s;tus, have a right to &s;urprize
us; yet they are &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the tem|per
of the times; the Republic was &s;ubverted,
but the minds of the Romans were &s;till Re|publican.</P>
<P N="2">2. Aeneas's piety has been more generally
confe&s;&s;ed than admired. St. Evremond laughs
at it, as un&s;uitable to his own temper. The
Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter defends it, as agreeable to
his own Sy&s;tem of the Lawgiver's Religion.
The French wit was too &s;uperficial, the Engli&s;h
&s;cholar too profound, to attend to the plain nar|ration
of the Poet, and the peculiar circum|&s;tances
of antient Heroes. WE believe from
faith and rea&s;on: THEY believed from the re|port
of their &s;en&s;es. Aeneas had &s;een the Gre|cian
Divinities overturning the foundations of
fated Troy. He was per&s;onally acquainted with
his mother Venus, and with his per&s;ecutor Juno.
Mercury, who commanded him to leave Car|thage,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
was as pre&s;ent to his eyes as Dido, who
&s;trove to detain him. Such a knowledge of
Religion, founded on &s;en&s;e and experience, mu&s;t
in&s;inuate it&s;elf into every in&s;tant of our lives,
and determine every action. All this is, in|deed,
fiction; but it is fiction in which we chu&s;e
to acquie&s;ce, and which we ju&s;tly con&s;ider as the
charm of Poetry. If we allow, that Aeneas
lived in an intimate commerce with &s;uperior Be|ings,
we mu&s;t likewi&s;e allow, his love or his
fear, his confidence or his gratitude, towards
tho&s;e Beings, to di&s;play them&s;elves on every
proper occa&s;ion. Far from thinking Aeneas
too pious, I am &s;ometimes &s;urprized at his
want of faith. Forgetful of the Fates, which
had &s;o often and &s;o clearly pointed out the de|&s;tined
&s;hores of Latium, he deliberates, whether
he &s;hall not &s;it down quietly in the fields of Si|cily.
An apparition of his father is nece&s;&s;ary
to divert him from this impious and ungene|rous
de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Hero's valor will not bear the rude
breath of &s;u&s;picion; yet has the courage of

Had Virgil de&s;igned to compo&s;e a POLITICAL

in which he would have proceeded. The

de&s;igned to educate a prince for the happine&s;s of

<HI>Ergo, &amp;c.</HI></Q> This doctrine of types and &s;ha|dows,
though true in general, has on this, as
well as on graver occa&s;ions, produced a great
abu&s;e of rea&s;on, or at lea&s;t of rea&s;oning. To
confine my&s;elf to Virgil, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that he
was too judicious to compliment the Emperor,
at the expence of good &s;en&s;e and probability.
Every age has its manners; and the poet mu&s;t
&s;uit his Hero to the Age, and not the Age to his
Hero. It is ea&s;y to give in&s;tances of this truth.
Marc Antony, when defeated and be&s;ieged in
Alexandria, challenged his competitor to decide
their quarrel by a &s;ingle combat. This was re|jected
by Augu&s;tus with contempt and deri&s;ion,
as the la&s;t effort of a de&s;perate man<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, in Vit. M. Anton. tom. i. 950. Edit. Wechel.</NOTE>; and the
world applauded the prudence of Augu&s;tus, who
preferred the part of a General to that of a Gla|diator.
The temper and good &s;en&s;e of Virgil
mu&s;t have made him view things in the &s;ame
light; yet, when Virgil introduces Aeneas in
&s;imilar circum&s;tances, he gives him a quite dif|ferent
conduct. The Hero wi&s;hes to &s;pare the
innocent people, provokes Turnus to a &s;ingle
combat, and, even after the perfidy and la&s;t de|feat
of the Rutuli, is &s;till ready to ri&s;k his per|&s;on
and victory, again&s;t the unhappy life and
de&s;perate fortunes of his Rival. The laws of
Honor are different in different Ages; and a be|haviour
<PB N="21" REF="23">
which in Augu&s;tus was decent, would
have covered Aeneas with infamy.</P>
<P>We may apply this ob&s;ervation to the very
ca&s;e of the Eleu&s;inian My&s;teries. Augu&s;tus was
initiated into them, at a time when Eleu&s;is was
become the COMMON TEMPLE OF THE UNI|VERSE.
The Trojan Hero could not with the

World from the Tyranny of Religion, and the
Fear of a Future State. The&s;e ideas, Virgil was

Virgil has no &s;uch claim to our indul|gence.
THE MIND of the UNIVERSE is rather a
Metaphy&s;ical than a Theological Being. His
intellectual qualities are faintly di&s;tingui&s;hed
from the Powers of Matter, and his moral At|tributes,
the &s;ource of all religious wor&s;hip, form

allow, what I believe may in general be true,
that the My&s;teries exhibited a theatrical repre|&s;entation
of all that was believed or imagined
of the lower world; that the A&s;pirant was con|ducted
through the mimic &s;cenes of Erebus, Tar|tarus,

warmth of fancy and the ju&s;tne&s;s of imitation
had concealed from us. In the &s;ame manner it
is from extrin&s;ical circum&s;tances, that we may
expect the di&s;covery of Virgil's Allegory. Every
one of tho&s;e circum&s;tances per&s;uades me, that
Virgil de&s;cribed a real, not a mimic world, and
that the Scene lay in the Infernal Shades, and

The lake Avernus was the chief object of reli|gious
horror; the black Woods which &s;urround|ed
it, when Virgil fir&s;t came to Naples, were
perfectly &s;uited to feed the &s;uper&s;tition of the
People<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. v. p. 168.</NOTE>. It was generally believed, that this
<PB N="31" REF="33">
deadly flood was the entrance of Hell<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Silius Italicus, l. xii.</NOTE>; and
an Oracle was once e&s;tabli&s;hed on its banks,
which pretended, by magic rites, to call up the
departed Spirits<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sicul. l. iv. p. 267. edit. We&s;&s;eling.</NOTE>. Aeneas, who revolved a
more daring enterpri&s;e, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the
Prie&s;te&s;s of tho&s;e dark Regions. Their conver|&s;ation
may perhaps inform us, whether an Ini|tiation,

and every in&s;tant, may lead us to the grave is a
melancholy truth. The My&s;teries were only
open at &s;tated times, a few days at mo&s;t in the
cour&s;e of a year. The mimic de&s;cent of the
My&s;teries was laborious and dangerous, the re|turn

1. That after accompanying the Hero

apparent irregularities of the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem are
corrected; where the Patriot who died for his
Country is happy, and the Tyrant who oppre&s;&s;ed
it is mi&s;erable. 3. As we intere&s;t our&s;elves in
the Hero's fortunes, we &s;hare his feelings: The
melancholy Palinurus, the wretched Deiphobus,
the indignant Dido; the Grecian Kings, who
tremble at his pre&s;ence, and the venerable An|chi&s;es,
who embraces his pious &s;on, and di&s;plays

&s;everal &s;tages of an intricate Hypothe&s;is. He
mu&s;t now permit me to alledge two very &s;imple

revealed the Secret of the Eleu&s;inian My&s;teries;
the fir&s;t is HIS IGNORANCE, and the &s;econd HIS
DISCRETION.</P>
<P N="1">I. As his Lord&s;hip has not made the &s;malle&s;t
attempt to prove that Virgil was him&s;elf ini|tiated,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
it is plain that he &s;uppo&s;ed it, as a thing
of cour&s;e. Had he any right to &s;uppo&s;e it? By
no means: That ceremony might naturally
enough fini&s;h the education of a young Athe|nian;
but a Barbarian, a Roman, would mo&s;t
probably pa&s;s through life without directing his
devotion to the foreign rites of Eleu&s;is.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophical &s;entiments of Virgil were
&s;till more unlikely to in&s;pire him with that kind
of devotion. It is well known that he was a de|termined
Epicurean<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See the Life of Virgil by Donatus, the Sixth Eclogue, and the Second Georgic, ver. 490.</NOTE>; and a very natural An|tipathy
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Epicureans and the
Managers of the My&s;teries. The Celebration
opened with a &s;olemn excommunication of tho&s;e
Athei&s;tical Philo&s;ophers, who were commanded
to retire, and to leave that holy place for pious
Believers<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lucian in Alexandro, p. 489.</NOTE>; the zeal of the people was ready
to enforce this admonition. I will not deny, that
curio&s;ity might &s;ometimes tempt an Epicurean
to pry into the&s;e &s;ecret rites; and that gratitude,
fear, or other motives, might engage the Athe|nians
to admit &s;o irreligious an A&s;pirant. Atti|cus

Nay, more; I am &s;trongly inclined to think

when the materials of our knowledge are &s;o very

<P>The&s;e lines belong to an Ode of Horace,
which has every merit, except that of order.
That Death in our Country's cau&s;e is plea&s;ant
and honourable; that Virtue does not depend
on the caprice of a popular Election; and that
<PB N="43" REF="45">
the My&s;teries of Ceres ought not to be di&s;clo&s;ed,
are ideas which have no apparent connection.
The beautiful di&s;order of Lyric Poetry, is the
u&s;ual Apology made by Profe&s;&s;ed Critics on

An in&s;ufficient Apology for the few, who dare
judge from their own feelings. I &s;hall not deny,
that the irregular notes of an untutored Mu&s;e
have &s;ometimes delighted me. We can very
&s;eldom be di&s;plea&s;ed with the uncon&s;trained
workings of Nature. But the Liberty of an Out|law
is very different from that of a Savage. It
is a mighty di&s;agreeable &s;ight, to ob&s;erve a Ly|ric
Writer of Ta&s;te and Reflection &s;triving to
forget the Laws of Compo&s;ition, disjointing the
order of his Ideas, and working him&s;elf up into
artificial Madne&s;s,

I had once &s;ucceeded (as I thought) in remov|ing
this defect, by the help of an Hypothe&s;is
which connected the &s;everal parts of Horace's
Ode with each other. My Ideas appeared (I
mean to my&s;elf) mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly conceived. I
read the Ode once more, and burnt my Hypo|the&s;is.
But to return to our principal &s;ubject.</P>

The Date of this Ode may be of u&s;e to us;
and the date may be fixed with tolerable cer|tainty,
from the mention of the PARTHIANS,

that of 734 has a &s;uperior claim to the Compo|&s;ition

pacified the We&s;tern provinces, he had lei&s;ure
to turn his Views towards the Ea&s;t. From that

As a friend and as a Critic, Horace was entitled
to all Virgil's confidence, and was probably ac|quainted
with the whole progre&s;s of the Aeneid,
from the fir&s;t rude &s;ketch, which Virgil drew
up in Pro&s;e, to that harmonious Poetry, which
the author alone thought unworthy of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>To re&s;ume my Idea, which depended on this
long deduction of Circum&s;tances; when Horace
compo&s;ed the &s;econd ode of his third Book, the
Aeneid, and particularly the Sixth Book, were
already known to the Public. The dete&s;tation
of the Wretch who reveals the My&s;teries of Ce|res,
though expre&s;&s;ed in general terms, mu&s;t
be applied by all Rome to the author of the
Sixth Book of the Aeneid. Can we &s;eriou&s;ly
&s;uppo&s;e, THAT HORACE WOULD HAVE BRANDED
WITH SUCH WANT ON IN FAMY, ONE OF THE MEN
IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVED AND HONOURED
THE MOST<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Horat. l. I. od. iii. L. I. &s;erm. v. ver. 39, &amp;c.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">
Nothing remains to &s;ay, except that Horace
was him&s;elf ignorant of his friend's allegorical
meaning, which the Bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter has
&s;ince revealed to the World. It may be &s;o;
yet, for my own part, I &s;hould be very well &s;a|tisfied
with under&s;tanding Virgil no better than
Horace did.</P>
<P>It is perhaps &s;ome &s;uch fooli&s;h fondne&s;s for
Antiquity, which inclines me to doubt, whether
the BISHOP OF GLOCESTER has really united
the &s;evere &s;en&s;e of ARISTOTLE with the &s;ublime
imagination of LONGINUS. Yet a judicious
Critic, (who is now, I believe, ARCHDEACON
OF GLOCESTER) a&s;&s;ures the Public, that his
Patron's mere amu&s;ements have done much
more than the joint labours of the two Gre|cians.
I &s;hall conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations with
a remarkable pa&s;&s;age from the Archdeacon's
Dedication<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See the Dedication of Horace's Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus, with an Engli&s;h Commentary and Notes.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline">It was not enough, in YOUR

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS not ignorant, that, &s;everal years
&s;ince, the Rev. Dr. Jortin had favoured
the Public, with a DISSERTATION ON THE
STATE OF THE DEAD, AS DESCRIBED BY HO|MER
AND VIRGIL<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Six Di&s;&s;ertations on Different Subjects, publi&s;hed in a Volume in Octavo, in the year 1755, It is the Sixth Di&s;|&s;ertation, p. 207-324.</NOTE>: But the Book is now
grown &s;o &s;carce, that I was not able to procure
a &s;ight of it till after the&s;e Papers had been
already &s;ent to the pre&s;s. I found Dr. Jortin's
performance, as I expected, moderate, learned,
and critical. Among a variety of ingenious
ob&s;ervations, there are two or three which are
very clo&s;ely connected with my pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I had pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence one argument of
the Bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter, or rather of Scarron
and the Bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter; &s;ince the former
found the Remark, and the latter furni&s;hed the
Inference.
<Q>Di&s;cite ju&s;titiam moniti, &amp; non temnere Divos,</Q>
cries the unfortunate Phlegyas. In the mid&s;t
of his torments, he preaches Ju&s;tice and Piety,
<PB N="52" REF="53">
like Ixion in Pindar. A very u&s;eful piece of
advice, &s;ays the French Buffoon, for tho&s;e who
were already damned to all Eternity:
<Q><L>Cette &s;entence e&s;t bonne &amp; belle:</L>
<L>Mais en enfer, de quoi &s;ert elle?</L></Q>
From this judicious piece of Critici&s;m his
Lord&s;hip argues, that Phlegyas was preaching
not to the Dead, but to the Living; and that
Virgil is only de&s;cribing the Mimic Tartarus,
which was exhibited at Eleu&s;is for the in&s;truc|tion
of the Initiated.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tran&s;cribe one or two of the rea&s;ons,
which Dr. Jortin conde&s;cends to oppo&s;e to Scar|ron's
Critici&s;m.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>To preach to the Damned, &s;ays he, is la|bour
in vain. And what if it is? It might
be part of his puni&s;hment, to exhort him&s;elf
and others, when exhortations were too late.
This admonition, as far as it relates to him|&s;elf
and his companions in mi&s;ery, is to be
looked upon not &s;o much as an admonition
to amend, but as a bitter &s;arca&s;m, and re|proaching
of pa&s;t iniquities.</P>
<P>It is labour in vain. But in the poetical
&s;y&s;tem, it &s;eems to have been the occupa|tion
of the Damned to labour in vain, to
catch at meat and drink that fled from
them, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">
His in&s;truction, like that of Ixion in
Pindar, might be for the u&s;e of the living.
You will &s;ay, <HI>how can that be?</HI> Surely no|thing
is more ea&s;y and intelligible. The
Mu&s;es hear him&mdash;The Mu&s;es reveal it to
the Poet, and the in&s;pired Poet reveals it
to mankind. And &s;o much for Phlegyas
and Mon&s;ieur Scarron.</P></Q></P>
<P>It is prettily ob&s;erved by Dr. Jortin, <Q REND="inline">That
Virgil, after having &s;hone out with full &s;plen|dor
through the Sixth Book, &s;ets at la&s;t in a
cloud.</Q> The IVORY GATE puzzles every
Commentator, and grieves every lover of Virgil:
Yet it affords no advantages to the Bi&s;hop of
Gloce&s;ter. The objection pre&s;&s;es as hard on
the notion of an Initiation, as on that of a real
De&s;cent to the Shades. <Q REND="inline">The trouble&s;ome
conclu&s;ion &s;till remains as it was; and from
the manner in which the Hero is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
after the Ceremonies, we learn, that in tho&s;e
Initiations, the Machinery, and the whole
Shew, was (in the Poet's opinion) a repre|&s;entation
of things, which had no truth or
reality.</Q><Q><L>Altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto:</L>
<L>Sed <HI>FALSA</HI> ad coelum mittunt <HI>INSOMNIA</HI> manes.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Dreams in general, may be called <HI>vain</HI> and
<HI>deceitful, &s;omnia vana,</HI> or <HI>&s;omnia fal&s;a,</HI> if
you will, as they are oppo&s;ed to the <HI>real</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="55">
objects, which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us when
we are awake. But when <HI>fal&s;e</HI> dreams are
oppo&s;ed to <HI>true</HI> ones, there the Epithet <HI>fal&s;a</HI>
has another meaning. True dreams repre&s;ent
what is real, and &s;hew what is true; fal&s;e
dreams repre&s;ent things, which are not, or
which are not true. Thus Homer and Vir|gil,
and many other poets, and indeed the
nature of the thing, di&s;tingui&s;h them.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Jortin, though with reluctance, acqui|e&s;ces
in the common opinion, that by &s;ix un|lucky
lines, Virgil is de&s;troying the beautiful
Sy&s;tem, which it had co&s;t him eight hundred
to rai&s;e. He explains too this prepo&s;terous
conduct, by the u&s;ual expedient of the Poet's
Epicurei&s;m. I only differ from him in attri|buting
to ha&s;te and indi&s;cretion, what he con&s;i|ders
as the re&s;ult of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on, both new and ingenious, is
a&s;&s;igned by Dr. Jortin, for Virgil explaining
away his Hero's de&s;cent into an idle dream.
<Q REND="inline">All communication with the Dead, the in|fernal
powers, &amp;c. belonged to the Art
Magic, and Magic was held in abomina|tion
by the Romans.</Q> Yet if it was held in
ABOMINATION, it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be real. A
writer would not have made his court to James
the fir&s;t, by repre&s;enting the &s;tories of Witch|craft
as the Phantoms of an over-heated Ima|gination.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">
Whil&s;t I am writing, a &s;udden thought oc|curs
to me, which, rude and imperfect as it is,
I &s;hall venture to throw out to the Public. It
is this. After Virgil, in imitation of Homer,
had de&s;cribed the two Gates of Sleep, the Horn
and the Ivory, he again takes up the fir&s;t in a
different &s;en&s;e:
<Q>QUA VERIS FACILIS DATUR EXITUS UMBRIS.</Q>
The TRUE SHADES, VERAE UMBRAE, were tho&s;e
airy forms which were continually &s;ent to animate
new bodies, &s;uch light and almo&s;t immaterial
Natures as could without difficulty pa&s;s through
a thin tran&s;parent &s;ub&s;tance. In this new &s;en&s;e,
Aeneas and the Sybill, who were &s;till incum|bered
with a load of fle&s;h, could not pretend to
the prerogative of TRUE SHADES. In their
pa&s;&s;age over Styx, they had almo&s;t &s;unk Cha|ron's
boat.<Q><L>Gemuit &s;ub pondere cymba</L>
<L>Sutilis, &amp; multam accepit rimo&s;a paludem.</L></Q></P>
<P>Some other Expedient was requi&s;ite for their
return; and &s;ince the Horn Gate would not af|ford
them an ea&s;y di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, the other pa&s;&s;age,
which was adorned with poli&s;hed Ivory, was
the only one that remained either for them, or
for the Poet.</P>
<P>By this explanation, we &s;ave Virgil's judge+ment
and religion, though I mu&s;t own, at the
<PB N="56" REF="57">
expence of an uncommon har&s;hne&s;s and am|biguity
of expre&s;&s;ion. Let it only be remem|bered,
that tho&s;e, who, in de&s;perate ca&s;es, con|jecture
with mode&s;ty, have a right to be heard
with indulgence.</P>
