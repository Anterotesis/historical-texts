<HEAD>An ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MEN, in delineating the divine attri|butes,
have too generally blended with
them all their own imperfections. Their
&s;everal, &s;eparate intere&s;ts, and contradictory pa&s;|&s;ions,
have led them, even under the character of
<HI>the One God,</HI> to repre&s;ent to us almo&s;t as many dif|ferent
gods, as impeached the wi&s;dom, di&s;graced
the wor&s;hip, and &s;ullied all the glory of the antient
Greeks and Romans. Nay, the &s;ame per&s;ons, in
their very <HI>Harmonies,</HI> have repre&s;ented one attri|bute,
as a flat contradiction to another. Blind
and pre&s;umptuous creatures! It is well for your|&s;elves,
that your jarring &s;y&s;tems cannot at all af|fect
the real character of the Supreme Being. To
the joy of the whole univer&s;e, whatever you have
&s;aid, and whatever you may &s;till &s;ay, <HI>God is the
&s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But, &s;hould it be &s;till a&s;ked, To what cau&s;es are
we to a&s;cribe the mon&s;trous mi&s;repre&s;entations of
the Deity which daily occur? After what has been
&s;aid above, I need only reply, Is not the cau&s;e
quite obvious? Or, if de&s;ired to explain my&s;elf
more particularly, I would ob&s;erve, That men,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
in&s;tead of &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ulting the works and will
of God, and hence inferring what his perfections
are, have, on the contrary, regarded only their
own tempers and inclinations, and, to vindicate
all the follies and impieties ari&s;ing from the&s;e, have
endeavoured to per&s;uade the world, that the
peerle&s;s Jehovah is <HI>altogether &s;uch a one as them|&s;elves.</HI>
As men have been interchangeably actuated
with different malignant pa&s;&s;ions, they have pro|portionably
repre&s;ented to them&s;elves a God, who
would be plea&s;ed with &s;uch wor&s;hippers. And thus
have they, at different times, endeavoured to di|ve&s;t
him of his mo&s;t honourable perfections: they
have repeatedly, indeed, been &s;o glaringly incon|&s;i&s;tent
with them&s;elves, as to adore him, in the
&s;ame breath, as <HI>the Father of all mercies,</HI> and as <HI>a
Being without any mercy at all,</HI> that is, a <HI>reprobating
God.</HI></P>
<P>But, of all the perfections of the ever ble&s;&s;ed
God, his ju&s;tice has perhaps, in general, been the
lea&s;t under&s;tood. However, under no other cha|racteri&s;tic
whatever, has he been &s;o &s;hockingly
mi&s;repre&s;ented and bla&s;phemed. The ju&s;tice of
God, indeed, has been frequently de&s;cribed in
&s;uch a light, as &s;uppo&s;ed him di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every
endearing excellency, as declared him not the
Friend and Father, but the mercile&s;s Tyrant of the
univer&s;e, and as led us to think upon his holy
name, not with hope, confidence, and joy. but
with all the trembling horrors of de&s;pair. Men, in
vindicating what they called the Ju&s;tice of God, have
too often lo&s;t fight of his goodne&s;s; nay, have en|tertained
and propagated &s;uch ideas of ju&s;tice, as
ab&s;olutely militated again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of good|ne&s;s,
and as forbad us to con&s;ider him as at all
merciful, gracious, compa&s;&s;ionate, forbearing, and
long-&s;uffering. This has been always the ca&s;e,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
when ju&s;tice has been repre&s;ented as an e&s;&s;ential
obligation, or unchangeable di&s;po&s;ition in the Su|preme
Being, to puni&s;h every the lea&s;t offence,
iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, or &s;in, in every rational
creature, or, when by &s;aying, that <Q>God was
ju&s;t,</Q> it was meant, that, <Q>there was no for|givene&s;s
with him, without an equivalent &s;atis|faction.</Q>
But, the bare mention of &s;uch an idea
of ju&s;tice, mu&s;t, I &s;hould think, convince every
rational being, that it is fal&s;e. It mu&s;t be plainly
&s;een, that ju&s;tice, in this light, or, rather in this
darkne&s;s, is only another term for rigour, for in|flexible
rigour, and implacable &s;everity; a cha|racter
that we dete&s;t even in man, and which we
cannot therefore apply to the infinitely adorable
God, without being guilty of the mo&s;t outrageous
impiety. It mu&s;t, I &s;ay, plainly be &s;een, that if
ju&s;tice &s;ignified rigour, God could not be ju&s;t and
good, at the &s;ame time: for the one is as contrary
to the other, as light is to darkne&s;s. This will be
evident, from the univer&s;ally allowed acceptation
of the terms.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, goodne&s;s implies, it is
well known, that benefits are be&s;towed without the
pro&s;pect of any return. But rigour implies, as the
proverb goes, that <HI>nothing is done for nothing.</HI>
Again, the goodne&s;s of God implies, that he is not
&s;trict to mark our iniquities. But rigour, if this
could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of his attributes, mu&s;t
make him puni&s;h, with exact weight and mea&s;ure,
every failing, not excepting the &s;malle&s;t, of which
any being is guilty. Hence, then, it is obvious,
that tho&s;e who under&s;tand, by the ju&s;tice of God,
his unchangeable di&s;po&s;ition not to pardon the
lea&s;t violation of his laws, without an equivalent
&s;atisfaction, ina&s;much as they thus declare, that
<PB N="4" REF="5">
there is no forgivene&s;s with him, expre&s;sly de|clare,
at the &s;ame time, that he is neither mer|ciful,
nor good. Nor do they at all alter the ca&s;e,
by &s;uppo&s;ing that he will accept that debt from
another, which the delinquent him&s;elf is not able
to pay; for, this is &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing, that there is no
forgivene&s;s with him, or that there is no goodne&s;s
with him, for a good being mu&s;t have forgivene&s;s
in him&s;elf. Accordingly, we never a&s;cribe for|givene&s;s,
or goodne&s;s, to the man, who in&s;i&s;ts
upon the whole of his debt, and who will never
be &s;atisfied until the whole is paid, though he
&s;hould con&s;ent. at the &s;ame time, to accept this
debt from another be&s;ides the per&s;on who owes it;
for, by accepting it even from another, he has all
he could demand, and all he could form any pre|ten&s;ions
to have a right to receive. Nor do we
ever a&s;cribe any merit or prai&s;e to &s;uch a man;
the&s;e are due only to him who paid the debt, not
at all to him who received it to the full, though
from the hand of a third per&s;on: Surely, then,
we cannot compare the ever ble&s;&s;ed God to &s;uch
a man; we cannot dive&s;t him of goodne&s;s; we
cannot repre&s;ent him in a light that would fix a
reproach upon any of his imperfect creatures.
We cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that there is any goodne&s;s or
mercy in the univer&s;e, if not with him, the foun|tain
of the whole. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that
any of his creatures are more benevolently di&s;|po&s;ed
than the great Creator. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e
that, if there be any love, any tenderne&s;s, or com|pa&s;&s;ion,
in any being whatever, the&s;e mu&s;t re&s;ide,
in their infinite fullne&s;s, in the Almighty and ever|la&s;ting
God. Rigour, therefore, cannot be one
of his attributes. His ju&s;tice mu&s;t be &s;uch, as ren|ders
him the object of our mo&s;t delightful con|templations,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
and as is con&s;i&s;tent, therefore, with
all his other mo&s;t glorious perfections. This, I
&s;hall now endeavour to &s;hew, is not only the doc|trine
of rea&s;on, but is likewi&s;e deducible from the
whole volume of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, then, a fine field for &s;atisfying
all our enquiries is opened to us in the eighteenth
chapter of the book of Gene&s;is, which, from the
twentieth to the end of the thirty-&s;econd ver&s;e, ex|pre&s;sly
treats of the ju&s;tice of God. <HI>The LORD
&s;aid,</HI> to Abraham, <HI>becau&s;e the cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is great, and their &s;in is very grievous;
I will go down now, and &s;ee whether they have done
altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me, and if not, I will know</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mere cavillers only can object to the familiarity of the language u&s;ed in this pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE>.&mdash;<HI>And Abraham
drew near, and &s;aid, Wilt thou al&s;o de&s;troy the righ|teous
with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city: wilt Thou al&s;o de&s;troy and
not &s;pare the place for the fifty righteous that are</HI>
therein? <HI>That be far from Thee, to do after this
manner, to &s;lay the righteous with the wicked: and
that the righteous &s;hould be as the wicked, that be far
from thee: SHALL NOT THE JUDGE OF ALL
THE EARTH DO RIGHT? And the Lord &s;aid,
If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will &s;pare all the place for their &s;akes. And
Abraham an&s;wered and &s;aid, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to &s;peak unto the LORD, who am but
du&s;t and a&s;hes. Peradventure, there &s;hall lack five of
the fifty righteous: wilt thou de&s;troy all the city for</HI> lack
of <HI>five? And he &s;aid, If I find there forty and five,
I will not de&s;troy</HI> it. <HI>And he &s;pake unto him yet
again, and &s;aid, Peradventure there &s;hall be forty
found there. And he &s;aid, I will not do it for forty's
<PB N="6" REF="7">
&s;ake. And he &s;aid unto him, O let not the LORD
be angry, and I will &s;peak: Peradventure there &s;hall
thirty be found there. And he &s;aid, I will not do it
if I find thirty there. And he &s;aid, Behold now, I
have taken upon me to &s;peak unto the LORD: Per|adventure
there &s;hall be twenty found there. And he
&s;aid, I will not de&s;troy it for twenty's &s;ake. And he
&s;aid, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
&s;peak yet but this once: Peradventure ten &s;hall be
found there. And he &s;aid, I will not de&s;troy it for
ten's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>Now, there is not a &s;ingle circum&s;tance in this
hi&s;tory, which can lead us to conclude, that the
Ju&s;tice of God is repugnant to his merey, but only
that it e&s;&s;entially belongs to him, as a ju&s;t being,
to make a di&s;tinction between the righteous and
the wicked, and not to de&s;troy the innocent with
the guilty. Abraham intreated God not to puni&s;h,
but to &s;pare, to &s;pare even the guilty, if it &s;hould
&s;eem good to his infinite wi&s;dom, or, if they were
found to be pa&s;t hopes, to be incorrigibly hardened
and impenitent, to vindicate his ju&s;tice, by &s;end|ing
redemption to the righteous. Nor did the
LORD threaten to de&s;troy Sodom and Gomor|rah,
becau&s;e the inhabitants were imperfect crea|tures,
or becau&s;e they had fallen into involuntary
errors, or becau&s;e that, though they might be then
penitent, they had formerly been wicked; but be|cau&s;e
that they were totally depraved, becau&s;e
they had irreclaimably given them&s;elves up to the
foule&s;t vices that could be perpetrated or invented,
and that no means of &s;alvation that were offered
them, could work a reformation in them, <Q>And
the Lord &s;aid, becau&s;e the cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is <HI>great,</HI> and becau&s;e their &s;in is <HI>very
grievous,</HI> I will &s;ee whether they have done ac|cording
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to the cry of it that is come unto me.</Q>
From which it may be concluded, that, if their
&s;ins had not been of the deepe&s;t dye, and &s;uch as
admitted of no &s;ort of extenuation; and had they
not re&s;olved to continue in them too, again&s;t all
po&s;&s;ible means of conviction, God would &s;till have
been gracious to them, and granted them a &s;pace
for repentance. We learn accordingly, that, after
the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah had been
greatly corrupted, &s;entence was not &s;uddenly exe|cuted
again&s;t them, but that Lot, on the contrary,
was &s;ent to &s;ojourn among them, to reprove them
for their impieties, and to admoni&s;h and per&s;uade
them, if po&s;&s;ible, to repent and live: and it was
not until they had rejected the&s;e means of grace,
abu&s;ed the divine forbearance and long-&s;uffering,
waxed &s;till wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and wholly given them|&s;elves
up to work all iniquity with greedine&s;s, that
the impending judgments of God were let loo&s;e
upon them. In his whole conduct towards this
people, his ju&s;tice did not at all interfere with his
mercy, his ju&s;tice did not hinder the calls of grace
and reconciliation for a longtime to take place; his
mercy was extended towards them until the farther
exten&s;ion of it could be of no u&s;e to them; indeed
until mercy and goodne&s;s to other nations rendered
their de&s;truction nece&s;&s;ary. Abraham, therefore,
did not addre&s;s God, &s;aying, that his ju&s;tice re|quired
immediate vengeance upon all his adver&s;a|ries,
or that his ju&s;tice was irreconcileable with his
pardoning, or forbearing to puni&s;h, any criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, mu&s;t have been his language, had he entertained the common &s;hocking ideas of the divine ju&s;tice, or any ideas of this divine attribute at all &s;imilar to the&s;e.</NOTE>,
but that his ju&s;tice could not &s;uffer any evil to be|fal
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the righteous. <Q>Abraham drew near and &s;aid,
Wilt thou al&s;o de&s;troy the righteous with the
wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous
within the city: wilt thou al&s;o de&s;troy, and not
&s;pare the place for the fifty righteous that are
therein? That be far from thee, to do after this
manner: and, that the righteous &s;hould be as
the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the
judge of all the earth do right?</Q> Here, the line
of ju&s;tice is exactly drawn. And it has not, we &s;ee,
the lea&s;t re&s;pect to any kind of implacability in the
Divine Mind, nor does it &s;uppo&s;e that God cannot
<HI>freely</HI> pardon the truly penitent, in perfect con&s;i&s;|tency
with the full exerci&s;e of his ju&s;tice, but is
wholly confined to this rule, that God will make a
proper di&s;tinction between the righteous and the
wicked, and that he will puni&s;h none more than
their iniquities de&s;erve. In other words, the Ju&s;|tice
of God &s;ignifies that he is a being of ab&s;olute
and unchangeable rectitude, and that there is not
the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;hadow of any kind of inju&s;tice
with him; or, as Mo&s;es de&s;cribes him, cloathed
with this attribute, that, <HI>he is the rock, his work is
perfect; for all his ways are judgment; a God of
truth, and without iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI>
But here it &s;hould be particularly ob&s;erved, (when
we &s;ay that the Ju&s;tice of God &s;ignifies that there
is no <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> with him) that forgivene&s;s of &s;in is
not to be included in our idea of inju&s;tice: for, if
it was, what &s;hould become of the whole univer&s;e
of dependant beings? God chargeth his very an|gels
with folly; and as to the rational beings in this
world, <HI>what man is he, that liveth and &s;inneth not?</HI>
If God was, therefore, &s;trict to mark our iniqui|ties,
or if his ju&s;tice and pardoning mercy were
at variance, mi&s;ery mu&s;t inevitably be the portion
<PB N="9" REF="10">
of the whole human race. But, it is our comfort,
that God is not &s;trict to mark our iniquities, that
he delighteth not in the death of a &s;inner, that he
is gracious, forbearing, and long-&s;uffering towards
us, and not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h. It is
our comfort that his ju&s;tice is in no re&s;pect repug|nant
to his goodne&s;s, that his ju&s;tice freely admit|teth
of the infinite riches of his grace, that his ju&s;|tice
does not at all imply, that he is <HI>an inflexibly ri|gorous
judge,</HI> but only, that, <Q>he will make a pro|per
di&s;tinction between the righteous and the
wicked, that he will not puni&s;h the wicked more
than their iniquities de&s;erve, that he will not di&s;|appoint
the hopes, nor fru&s;trate the expectations
that he has rai&s;ed in his creatures, and that he
is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, <Q>The Ju&s;tice of God implies,
that he will make a proper di&s;tinction between
the righteous and the wicked.</Q> That the righ|teous
&s;hould be as the wicked, that be far from
God? Shall not the judge of all the earth do
right? It would be obviou&s;ly wrong to &s;lay the
righteous with the wicked, or to put the wicked on
a level with the righteous: and it would be more
wrong &s;till, it would be truly diabolical, to prefer
any of the wicked to any of the righteous, and,
merely to di&s;play his power, to introduce any of
the wicked to a place of happine&s;s, and to con&s;ign
any of the righteous to a place of mi&s;ery. God,
therefore, as a ju&s;t being, cannot admit the wicked
to the joys of the righteous; a di&s;tinction mu&s;t
take place, and a di&s;tinction among the righteous
them&s;elves, according as they &s;everally have been
more or le&s;s obedient to his voice. But, then, it
can be no inju&s;tice to the righteous, to grant the
wicked a &s;pace for repentance; nay, to bear long
<PB N="10" REF="11">
with them, to &s;ee if they will turn from their evil
ways, and to give them peace and reconciliation,
when influenced by that wi&s;dom which de&s;cended
from above, and following the innate dictates of
their own minds, they truly <HI>&s;eek the Lord and find
him.</HI> If this was inju&s;tice, the righteous them&s;elves
could have no hope; for they have not been al|ways
found perfect before God, they could, there|fore,
only look, in this ca&s;e, for a le&s;s degree of
puni&s;hment than would be inflicted on the wicked.
But all the ends of ju&s;tice mu&s;t, it is obvious, be
completely an&s;wered, by rewarding the righteous,
according to their &s;incere though imperfect obe|dience,
and by puni&s;hing the wicked, only when
their puni&s;hment becomes nece&s;&s;ary, when they
become reprobate to every good work; when,
therefore, farther forbearance towards them, not
being &s;ufficient to reform them, could be of no u&s;e
to them&s;elves, and might be cruelty to the re&s;t of
the creation.</P>
<P>Secondly, <Q>The Ju&s;tice of God implies, that,
he will not puni&s;h the wicked more than their
iniquities de&s;erve.</Q> This is obvious, at fir&s;t view:
for, &s;trict ju&s;tice can never exceed in its &s;entence
the proportion of guilt in any offender. God,
therefore, as a ju&s;t being, cannot puni&s;h us for
what we could not do, nor for what we could
not avoid doing, nor for any iniquities of
others, to which we were no way acce&s;&s;ary, nor
con&s;enting. On the contrary, as the mo&s;t ju&s;t
of all beings, he may be long-&s;uffering towards us,
and delay his judgments until the ruin of the inno|cent
would be the con&s;equence of any farther de|lay;
and, as the mo&s;t holy of all beings, he may
likewi&s;e graciou&s;ly accept the returning penitent.
How infinitely injurious is it to his ju&s;tice, there|fore,
even to in&s;inuate, that he will inflict endle&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="12">
torments upon a very great majority of his crea|tures,
for a crime that was committed before they
exi&s;ted, &s;ix thou&s;and years before <HI>many</HI> of them
exi&s;ted, and that <HI>there are millions of infants in hell
not a &s;pan long?</HI> I cannot &s;o much as mention this
doctrine of devils without the utmo&s;t horror. Nor
&s;hould I mention it at all, it reflects &s;uch di&s;honour
and reproach upon the children of men, to &s;uppo&s;e
that any individual of them is capable of believing
it, was it not known that there are &s;till &s;ome who
zealou&s;ly maintain and propagate it. Let &s;uch en|joy
their &s;entiments, if they can. But, while rea|&s;on
and revelation have any influence upon the
human mind, their God will be con&s;idered as a
fictitious being, the work of a bewildered imagina|tion,
and as &s;uch will be di&s;carded out of the
world.</P>
<P>But, thirdly, <Q>The Ju&s;tice of God requires, that
he will not di&s;appoint the hopes, nor fru&s;trate the
expectations which he has rai&s;ed in his creatures.</Q>
Ju&s;tice, even among mankind, requires, that we
&s;hould perform all our obligations to the full; that,
if we have made any promi&s;es, we &s;hould keep
them, that, if we have cheri&s;hed any particular
confidence in us, if we have even encouraged of|fenders
to hope for our favour, we &s;hould not
cruelly deceive them. Therefore the Ju&s;tice of
God requires, that he will fulfil all tho&s;e expecta|tions
which we are emboldened to form of his
goodne&s;s. Though Ju&s;tice could not oblige him
to promi&s;e immortality to tho&s;e who never de&s;erved
it; yet ju&s;tice en&s;ures immortality to the righteous
after it is promi&s;ed; and ju&s;tice en&s;ures pardon to
the truly penitent, after they are once encouraged
to hope for it at the throne of grace. Ju&s;tice, there|fore,
mu&s;t &s;atify tho&s;e de&s;ires of living beyond the
<PB N="12" REF="13">
grave, which for ever animate us, mu&s;t crown us
with unfading glory and honour, if we live up to
the terms of the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel, mu&s;t give us at all
times free acce&s;s to the throne of mercy, and
crown all our <HI>&s;incere</HI> though <HI>imperfect</HI> endeavours,
to humble our&s;elves before God, and to &s;erve him
in &s;pirit and in truth, with all tho&s;e rewards that
are repre&s;ented to us in the &s;acred trea&s;ury of his
word. The apo&s;tle, therefore, &s;ays, <Q>God is not
<HI>unrighteous</HI> to forget your labour of love;</Q> &s;igni|fying,
that after God has encouraged us, by a pa|tient
continuance in well doing, to &s;eek for glory,
honour, and immortality, he cannot, con&s;i&s;tently
with his ju&s;tice, di&s;appoint the hopes of his faithful
&s;ervants.</P>
<P>But, la&s;tly, <Q>The Ju&s;tice of God requires, that
he &s;hould be no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</Q> Ju&s;tice,
in the di&s;tribution of gifts or rewards, can only
con&s;ider the worthine&s;s or unworthine&s;s of any par|ticular
per&s;on, cannot re&s;pect any one man in pre|ference
to any other man of exactly the &s;ame pre|ten&s;ions
to favour. In the court of ju&s;tice, the
rich and the poor, the bond and the free, the
prince and the pea&s;ant, mu&s;t be upon the &s;ame
common level. In the court of ju&s;tice, there can
be no taking of bribes, nor di&s;tinction of country,
fect, or party. And, here, the good that we would
have done but could not. mu&s;t &s;et us in the &s;ame
light with tho&s;e, who had the opportunity and abi|lity,
as well as the will to do the &s;ame good. God,
therefore as a ju&s;t being&punc; can have no favou|rites
among his children, independently of their
devotedne&s;s to his &s;ervice. He cannot re&s;pect
their per&s;ons, nor be bia&s;&s;ed by pompous appear|ances:
but as he has made of one blood all nations
of men to dwell upon the face of the whole earth,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
whether you be Jew or Greek, ruler or &s;ubject,
ma&s;ter or &s;ervant, born in the fir&s;t or in the la&s;t
ages of the world, it makes no difference in his
eye. The only difference that he can make mu&s;t
ari&s;e from the different circum&s;tances in which
mankind have been placed. But, this difference
he mu&s;t make as no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. He can|not
require brick where there was no &s;traw. He
can only require a benevolent heart, where there
is neither &s;ilver nor gold: and, he cannot judge
tho&s;e by the law, who had not the law, nor tho&s;e
by the go&s;pel who had not the go&s;pel. Where he
has given ten talents, though there he mu&s;t be ex|pected
to look for the improvement of ten; yet,
where he has given only five talents, he can only
look for the improvement of five; and, where he
has given only two talents, he can only look for
the improvement of two. In &s;hort, the equally,
&s;incere and upright in his &s;ervice, all the advan|tages
or di&s;advantages of their &s;ituation being con|&s;idered,
mu&s;t be equally acceptable with him, and
equally rewarded by him.</P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to give the reader
right apprehen&s;ions of the divine ju&s;tice, and &s;uch
as repre&s;ent the great God to us, not in a forbid|ding,
but in an amiable and endearing light, I
&s;hall now proceed to &s;hew that the ju&s;tice of God
is, and mu&s;t be &s;uch as I have here de&s;cribed it.</P>
<P>This I &s;hall, fir&s;t, endeavour to &s;hew, upon the
principles of rea&s;on, from his other perfections;
and, &s;econdly, from the &s;criptural account of his
dealings with the children of men.</P>
<P>There can, then, it is obvious, in the fir&s;t place,
be no temptation to inju&s;tice, but from depen|dency
or want, or from motives of benefitting our|&s;elves
at the expence of others. God, therefore,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
being &s;upremely exalted above all principalities and
powers, the fountain of all being, the Lord of the
whole creation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in him&s;elf an infi|nite
and independant fullne&s;s of all po&s;&s;ible bli&s;s,
and it being impo&s;&s;ible that he can derive any be|nefit
from the oppre&s;&s;ion, or total extinction of
any, or of all his creatures: God, therefore, I &s;ay,
cannot po&s;&s;ibly do an unju&s;t thing. As all men
in common are equally his own offspring, &s;o far
he can make no di&s;tinction between them, but
every one man mu&s;t be as much the object of his
care and bounty as every other man. And, as he
could have no po&s;&s;ible motive to create any being,
but to make that being happy, he therefore cannot
po&s;&s;ibly take plea&s;ure in the mi&s;ery of any creature,
nor &s;uffer any creature to labour under oppre&s;&s;ion
without &s;ufficient rea&s;on, unle&s;s it be its own fault,
or he &s;hould know perplexed and cloudy circum|&s;tances
to be nece&s;&s;arily conducive to improve it
in knowledge, virtue, and happine&s;s. Farther, as
the infinite mind mu&s;t delight in tho&s;e perfections
in others which he exerci&s;eth him&s;elf, mu&s;t love
his own image in his creatures, mu&s;t approve of the
grateful and upright heart, mu&s;t con&s;equently di&s;|approve
of the profane and di&s;obedient wretch;
he mu&s;t, therefore, make a proper di&s;tinction be|tween
the righteous and the wicked, mu&s;t crown
the righteous with greater or with le&s;&s;er dignity and
glory, according to their &s;everal attainments in ho|line&s;s
and perfection, and mu&s;t debar the wicked
of the joys of the righteous. But, that the ju&s;tice
of God, at the &s;ame time, is in no ca&s;e repugnant
to his mercy, is demon&s;trable from our own exi&s;|tence,
from the numberle&s;s uncea&s;ing ble&s;&s;ings
which we daily receive, and from the animating
hopes, we are taught to entertain, of more enlarged
<PB N="15" REF="16">
communications of the divine favour in a future
&s;cene. We know, that we have all &s;inned again&s;t
him, and that if he &s;hould &s;trictly deal with us <HI>after
our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions,</HI> or determine not to pardon any
of our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t him, we mu&s;t long ago
have been con&s;umed. We know, therefore, that
his ju&s;tice and mercy are not at variance, that his
ju&s;tice is con&s;i&s;tent with his patience, forbear|ance,
and long-&s;uffering, that his ju&s;tice can be
&s;low to puni&s;h, and ready to pardon, and that it
can &s;pare the guilty them&s;elves, until they have
repeatedly rebelled again&s;t the divine laws, thrown
off the divine government entirely, and rejected
all tho&s;e means of conviction and &s;alvation, that
could be rea&s;onably extended towards them, or
be rea&s;onably expected from infinite benevolence.
Once more, as the only end of deferring puni&s;h|ment
can be the reformation of the offender, and
as we have a reli&s;h for, and are taught to look for|ward
to a future and everla&s;ting &s;tate of happine&s;s,
upon our &s;incere though imperfect endeavours to
&s;erve God; God, therefore, becau&s;e &s;o great, &s;o
glorious, and independant a &s;overeign, could have
no po&s;&s;ible motives to mock the creatures of his
power, but certainly intendeth us for &s;uch a &s;tate,
and certainly will introduce us to &s;uch a &s;tate, if
we make the be&s;t preparations in our power for it.
Tho&s;e hopes of the righteous, <HI>the&s;e longings after
immortality,</HI> which his infinite goodne&s;s, without
any claim or merit on our part, originally infu&s;ed
into the &s;oul, his infinite ju&s;tice mu&s;t fully &s;atisfy.
He cannot, as the univer&s;al Father, and the all-&s;ufficient
God, di&s;appoint any of tho&s;e expectations
which he has rai&s;ed in his rational creatures. His
ju&s;tice, I &s;ay, mu&s;t complete tho&s;e views, and, if
we live up to the dictates of his wi&s;dom, &s;atisfy
<PB N="16" REF="17">
tho&s;e boundle&s;s de&s;ires with which his adorable
and infinite goodne&s;s has in&s;pired us.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;entiments of rea&s;on upon this
&s;ubject: and, in perfect harmony with the&s;e, are
the hi&s;tory of God's dealings with the children of
men from the beginning of the world, and the
plain declaration of his revealed will, which are
recorded for our in&s;truction in the holy &s;criptures.
The fir&s;t man, Adam, experienced no kind of re|pugnancy
between the divine ju&s;tice and the divine
mercy. It was &s;aid even to Cain, after he <HI>was
very wroth, and his countenance fell&mdash;If thou doe&s;t
well &s;halt thou not be accepted?</HI> Nay, the ju&s;tice,
which afterwards puni&s;hed him for his great wicked|ne&s;s,
admitted of the exten&s;ion of mercy, upon
his repentance; and his puni&s;hment &s;eems to have
been purpo&s;ely calculated to lead him to repen|tance.
The doctrine, which I have been endea|vouring
to e&s;tabli&s;h is &s;till farther confirmed, from
the hi&s;tory of David, Mana&s;&s;eh, and many other
remarkable delinquents. But, as it would be an
endle&s;s work, &s;o it does not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to
examine the divine di&s;pen&s;ations towards each
individual, who&s;e virtues, or vices, or who&s;e
virtues and vices together, are held up to
our ob&s;ervation in the &s;criptures. The hi&s;|tory
of the antediluvian world, the whole hi&s;|tory
of the Jews, from the beginning to end,
the hi&s;tory of Nineveh and Babylon, and Tyre
and Sidon, and the deplorable &s;tate of the
world, when the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us revealed all the
riches of God's grace to his mo&s;t abandoned off|&s;pring,
are all to my purpo&s;e. To my purpo&s;e
likewi&s;e are the innate &s;entiments of the human
mind, as the&s;e are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively repre&s;ented to us in
the &s;criptures. <Q>Doth God pervert judgment,
&s;ays Bildad, or doth the Almighty pervert ju&s;tice?</Q>
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Meaning, that God could not do an unju&s;t thing.
<Q>Is it good unto thee,</Q> &s;ays Job, <Q>that thou
&s;hould'&s;t oppre&s;s? that thou &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the
work of thine hands? and &s;hine upon the council
of the wicked? He is excellent&mdash;in plenty of
ju&s;tice,</Q> &s;ays Elihu; <Q>he will not afflict,</Q> but ac|cording
to wi&s;dom and equity; <Q>and he &s;hall judge
the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, not
meaning with rigour, but without inju&s;tice; <Q>he
&s;hall mini&s;ter judgment to the people in upright|ne&s;s,
The LORD al&s;o will be a refuge for the
oppre&s;&s;ed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they
that know thy name, will put their tru&s;t in thee;
for thou, LORD, ha&s;t not for&s;aken them that
&s;eek thee.</Q> Again, the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <Q>Ju&s;tice
and judgment are the habitation of thy throne;
mercy and truth &s;hall go before thy face.</Q> In
like manner, God is repre&s;ented, by the prophet
Jeremiah, as proclaiming his own character, <Q>I
am the LORD, who exerci&s;e loving kindne&s;s,
judgment, and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth; for in
the&s;e things I delight, &s;aith the LORD.</Q> Here,
<HI>loving-kindne&s;s</HI> can evidently bear no oppo&s;ition to
<HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> though God will make a
di&s;tinction between the righteous and the wicked,
and inflict tremendous puni&s;hments upon the in|corrigibly
wicked, according to the preceding and
following ver&s;es. This is al&s;o the &s;entiment of
Eliphaz, when he &s;ays. <Q>Shall mortal man be
more ju&s;t than his Maker?</Q> Farther, the ideas
which I endeavoured to convey of the <HI>impartial</HI>
ju&s;tice of God, are likewi&s;e uniformly handed
down to us by the &s;acred penmen. <Q>He accepteth
not the per&s;ons of princes, nor re gardeth the rich
more than the poor,</Q> <HI>Job</HI> xxxiv. 19. <Q>Are ye
not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O
<PB N="18" REF="19">
children of I&s;rael, &s;aith the LORD.</Q> <Q>Of a
truth I perceive, &s;ays Peter, that God is no re|&s;pecter
of per&s;ons.</Q> Paul repeatedly &s;ays the &s;ame
thing, and a&s;ks the Romans, <Q>Is he the God of
the Jews only? Is he not al&s;o the God of the
Gentiles? Yea, of the Gentiles al&s;o.</Q> Again,
that the Ju&s;tice of God implies, that he will fulfil
tho&s;e expectations which he has rai&s;ed in his crea|tures,
is likewi&s;e expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted in the &s;crip|tures.
<Q>I will not leave thee,</Q> &s;aid he to Jacob,
<Q>until I have done that which I have &s;poken to
thee of.</Q> <Q>Thy councils of old are faithfulne&s;s
and truth, <BIBL><HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxv. 1.</BIBL></Q> <Q>All the promi&s;es of

vii. 9.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>More te&s;timonies from the &s;acred writings will
come in our way as we proceed. At pre&s;ent we
&s;ee that the &s;criptural accounts of the Ju&s;tice of
God, do not, any more than the po&s;itive deduc|tions
of Rea&s;on, repre&s;ent him in a forbidding,
but, on the contrary, in an endearing light, en|courage
our tru&s;t and confidence in him, and lead
us, if we love him, and keep his commandments,
to ca&s;t all our cares and burthens upon him. If
we &s;earch the &s;criptures from beginning to end, we
&s;hall not meet with a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, which informs
us, that he cannot pardon the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion
without a proportionable recompence, but, on the
contrary, that <HI>he knoweth our frame, and remem|bereth
that we are du&s;t,</HI> that he will not, therefore,
make a rigorous enquiry into our pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions,
but that, <HI>if we turn unto him, he will turn
unto us,</HI> and that, if the wicked man turneth away
from his wickedne&s;s which he has committed, He
<PB N="19" REF="20">
will <HI>abundantly pardon, and &s;ave his &s;oul alive.</HI> In
the &s;criptures, the Ju&s;tice of God is no where re|pre&s;ented
as the cau&s;e of confu&s;ion and terror to
the righteous, but as their &s;trong hold and &s;ecurity,
that they &s;hall never be moved. Thus we have al+ready
&s;een, that Abraham under&s;tood it, when he
pleaded for the people of Sodom, and expre&s;&s;ed
his confidence in God, as the Righteous judge of all
the earth. He did not mean, in any part of his ad|dre&s;s,
that tho&s;e righteous per&s;ons for whom he
pleaded, had never &s;inned in thought, word, or
deed. He only &s;uppo&s;ed that their hearts were
right towards God for the pre&s;ent, and that, of
whatever imperfections they had been guilty in
time pa&s;t, they were now &s;incerely devoted to his
&s;ervice. Upon this foundation, he pre&s;umes that
it would be <HI>unju&s;t</HI> in God to involve them in the
&s;ame de&s;truction with the inflexibly impenitent. To
the &s;ame purpo&s;e Jeho&s;aphat in&s;tructed the judges
of I&s;rael.&mdash;<Q>There is no iniquity with the LORD
our God, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of
gifts:</Q> by which he did not mean that the judges
&s;hould puni&s;h, with the utmo&s;t rigour, every mi&s;|demeanor
in tho&s;e delinquents that &s;hould come
before them, but only that they &s;hould not be bia&s;|&s;ed,
by any rewards, to wink at the oppre&s;&s;ion of
the innocent, or to patronize the evil-doer. Be|&s;ides,
we are repeatedly told, that God <HI>delighteth
not in the death of a &s;inner, but rather that he &s;hould
turn from his wickedne&s;s and live:</HI> which could not
be the ca&s;e, if the Ju&s;tice of God was at all repug|nant
to his mercy. Nay, when God him&s;elf ap|peals
to his ju&s;tice, he not only &s;hews that it was
tempered with mercy, but that it was wholly regu|lated
by the mo&s;t tender, boundle&s;s mercy.
<Q>Judge, I pray you,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>between me and my
<PB N="20" REF="21">
vineyard. What could have been done more to
my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</Q> Where
he &s;ignifies, that the glory of his ju&s;tice, con&s;i&s;ts in
kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ions, and in applying every
rea&s;onable means that can be offered for the reco|very
and &s;alvation of his back-&s;liding people.
Words cannot more &s;trongly expre&s;s this &s;entiment
than we find it in <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xviii. 25. <Q>Hear now,
O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, is not my way equal?</Q> The
<HI>way,</HI> or <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> of God referred to here, is
that the children &s;hould not bear the iniquities of
the fathers, that the &s;oul which &s;inned alone &s;hould
die, and that God has not any plea&s;ure at all that
the wicked &s;hould die, but rather that they &s;hould
turn from their evil ways and live. Are not my
ways equal? Am not I ju&s;t? when, in&s;tead of pu|ni&s;hing
one for the iniquities of another, or rigo|rou&s;ly
marking every iniquity committed again&s;t my
authority, I am even willing to pardon all the
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, however enormous and inexcu&s;able,
of the truly penitent. But, as full a proof as can
be given, that no implacability is to be included in
our ideas of the divine ju&s;tice, is to be drawn from
the directions that are given us for our own con|duct.
We learn, then, that to plea&s;e God, we
mu&s;t not only do ju&s;tly, but likewi&s;e love mercy,
and exerci&s;e forgivene&s;s. Now, here it is evident,
that if, <HI>to do ju&s;tly,</HI> was to puni&s;h with rigour every
offence committed again&s;t us, then, if we would
plea&s;e God by doing ju&s;tly, we could cxerci&s;e no
mercy or forgivene&s;s. Doing ju&s;tly, therefore, can
only &s;ignify, that we do no violence our&s;elves, that
we &s;hould deprive no fellow-creatures of their rights
and privileges, but do unto all others as we would
that they &s;hould do unto us. And, in this light we
are to view the divine ju&s;tice; it is &s;low to wrath,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and keepeth the door of mercy for ever open to
the penitent. <Q>Becau&s;e God is LORD of all,</Q>
as the author of the Book of Wi&s;dom &s;ays, <Q>it
maketh him to be gracious to all.</Q> And this
<HI>grace</HI> is without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. He regardeth
not the high more than the low, but, as the Apo|&s;tle
Peter &s;ays, <Q>In every nation, he that feareth
him, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with
him,</Q> It is not, till after repeated trials, and men
have been guilty of the mo&s;t daring impieties,
and become totally abandoned, that his judgments
take place. He is not &s;peedy in executing &s;en|tence
upon them, but cha&s;teneth them by little
and little, that they might fly from the wrath
to come. And, when he comes forth to judg|ment,
we are told, and may be a&s;&s;ured, that every
mouth &s;hall be &s;topped, and that none &s;hall be
able to accu&s;e him of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. <Q>He will
judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the people
with equity.</Q> When this grand and important
day arrives, <HI>&s;alvation and glory, and honour and
power,</HI> &s;hall be a&s;cribed <HI>unto the Lord our God, for
his true and righteous judgments;</HI> and, it will then
be found, beyond all que&s;tion, I dare &s;ay, that
God inflicteth puni&s;hment even upon the incor|rigibly
wicked, not becau&s;e his ju&s;tice cannot par|don,
but becau&s;e mercy to the univer&s;e renders
their puni&s;hment nece&s;&s;ary, and becau&s;e too, per|haps,
there can be no way, con&s;i&s;tent with infinite
wi&s;dom, of making the wicked happy. Be&s;ides,
God, in puni&s;hing the wicked, will eminently di&s;|play
his ju&s;tice, in proportioning the puni&s;hment
of every particular criminal, to his le&s;&s;er or greater
degree of impenitency and hardne&s;s of heart.
Tho&s;e, that have &s;inned without law, &s;hall al&s;o
peri&s;h without law; and while &s;ome are beaten
<PB N="22" REF="23">
with many &s;tripes, others, comparatively &s;peaking,
&s;hall be beaten with few &s;tripes. <Q>With the judg|ment
they judge, they &s;hall be judged; and with
the mea&s;ure they mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to
them again.</Q> The &s;ame ju&s;tice al&s;o will di&s;play
it&s;elf in rewarding the righteous. To &s;ome it will
be &s;aid. <HI>Come up hither.</HI> He, that &s;oweth &s;paringly,
&s;hall reap al&s;o &s;paringly; and he that &s;oweth boun|tifully,
&s;hall reap al&s;o bountifully. While all &s;hall
be exempted from every labour, pain, and &s;orrow,
the joy of &s;ome &s;hall tran&s;cendantly exceed that of
others. <Q>They that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the bright|ne&s;s
of the firmament; and they that have turned
many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>and have been righteous
them&s;elves,</HI> as the &s;tars for ever.</Q> The Ju&s;tice of
God, will pardon all their infirmities, and all
their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, of which they have re|pented,
that is, from which they have turned
away; and, according to the works of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
which they have done, <HI>he will divide to
each his portion.</HI> His goodne&s;s has promi&s;ed this.
His ju&s;tice therefore will bring it to pa&s;s. Yes,
Though we have &s;inned, yet if we have for&s;aken
our &s;ins, acquired a new heart, and a new &s;pirit,
and approved our&s;elves holy in all manner of con|ver&s;ation
and godline&s;s; if, in preference to all the
honours, and riches, and plea&s;ures of the world,
we have, by a patient continuance in well-doing,
&s;ought for glory and honour, and immortality, then,
notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e doings that have not been
good, and which we have &s;eriou&s;ly amended, God
will grant us all we want, all the riches of eternal
life. <HI>He is not unrighteous,</HI> as we have already af|firmed
with the apo&s;tle, <HI>to forget our labour of love.</HI>
He is faithful in all his promi&s;es, and cannot di&s;|appoint
tho&s;e hopes, nor fru&s;trate tho&s;e noble ex|pectations
which he has rai&s;ed. Nay, he will not
<PB N="23" REF="24">
only not fru&s;trate tho&s;e expectations, not only give
us the victory over death and the grave, and intro|duce
us to happine&s;s, but, <HI>eye has not &s;een, nor ear
heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man
to conceive the things which God has prepared for
them that love him. Thy righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> O Lord,
<HI>is an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thy law is the
truth.</HI> The heavens <HI>&s;hall declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s;
for God is judge him&s;elf. Lord God of I&s;rael, there
is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth
beneath, who keepe&s;t covenant and mercy with thy &s;er|vants,
that walk before thee with all their hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Such are the notions which rea&s;on and &s;cripture,
clearly, I think, lead us to form of the divine ju&s;|tice.
A great variety of objections, however, it
will po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aid, may &s;till be urged again&s;t it.
With all my heart, &s;ay I, if the objections will go
upon the &s;ame ground upon which I have endea|voured
to tread, that is, if rea&s;on and &s;cripture be
the te&s;timonies to which they appeal. But the mo&s;t
common objection to this doctrine, or the mo&s;t
common argument by which the contrary doctrine
is &s;upported, is nothing more than an impertinent
quotation from the apo&s;tle Paul. A man ri&s;es up,
and harangues to me, upon a multitude of <HI>unin|telligibles,</HI>
a&s;cribes certain random, arbitrary de|crees
to the infinitely wi&s;e governor of the univer&s;e,
then de&s;cribes his ju&s;tice to be &s;uch as I have &s;hewn
mu&s;t be an ab&s;olute bar to mercy, and after work|ing
him&s;elf into a tolerable heat, by much &s;peak|ing,
<HI>Who art thou,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that replie&s;t again&s;t God?</HI>
Now, to &s;uch a rea&s;oner I have only to &s;ay, <HI>Infal|lible
Sir! though thou art a God to thy&s;elf, thou art
not my God.</HI> But farther, it cannot be &s;eriou&s;ly
objected to the doctrine I have been vindicating,
<Q>that the wicked frequently bear rule in this life,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
and that their eyes &s;tand out with fatne&s;s; while
the righteous are afflicted, and mourn, and &s;ome|times
go down to the grave, labouring under the
rod of oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;orrow.</Q> This, I &s;ay, can|not
be &s;eriou&s;ly objected; becau&s;e this is the very
nature of a &s;tate of trial. Be&s;ides, amply to &s;atisfy
us upon this head, it is enough to &s;ay, that all the&s;e
things will be &s;et right on a future day, and that,
for every &s;uffering, into which we have fallen for
righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, or for the trial of our faith,
we &s;hall be infinitely recompenced at the re&s;urrec|tion
of the ju&s;t. Be&s;ides, we are often in our pro&s;|perity,
too apt to forget God; but adver&s;ity natu|rally
leads us to the rock that is higher than we.
The P&s;almi&s;t, therefore, &s;aid, that it was good for
him to have been afflicted, becau&s;e that before he
was afflicted, he went a&s;tray. Solomon &s;ays to
the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <Q>My &s;on, de&s;pi&s;e not the cha&s;|tening
of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor|rection;
for whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;ten|eth,
even as a father the &s;on in whom he de|lighteth.</Q>
And, our own experience te&s;tifies,
that &s;cenes of &s;orrow naturally humble the mind,
arre&s;t our wandering de&s;ires, and di&s;&s;ipated
thoughts, admoni&s;h us of our follies and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions,
and point out to us our true duty and
happine&s;s, and our only refuge from every cala|mity.
It would be unnece&s;&s;ary, I hope, to make
a formal reply to many other equally frivolous ob|jections,
which the reader can an&s;wer as &s;oon as
they occur. I &s;hall now, therefore, only conclude
with &s;ome obvious reflections, which naturally
ari&s;e from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve, fir&s;t of all, that the Ju&s;tice of
God, as I have here endeavoured to repre&s;ent it,
is, like all his other perfections, glorious. It is not
<PB N="25" REF="26">
&s;trict to mark our iniquities. It admitteth of grace
and reconciliation. It is founded on mercy and
goodne&s;s. It is a &s;ecurity to the righteous, that
they &s;hall never be moved. And it is a pledge to
the truly penitent of their future crown. It is,
therefore, endearing, and adorable, our refuge in
difficulties, our hope in trouble, our haven of re&s;t
from all the &s;torms of life, and our tower of de|fence
again&s;t every enemy, <HI>while we incline our

<P>But, &s;econdly, we &s;hould learn, from this de|&s;cription
of the divine ju&s;tice, what ought to be
the rules of ju&s;tice among men. It &s;hould have
no likene&s;s, we &s;ee, to that narrow, unfeeling, vin|dictive

tran&s;gre&s;s the boundaries of plain equity. But, it
is manife&s;tly unju&s;t, it is mo&s;t cruel, and iniqui|tous,
to put the life of one man upon a level with
the property of another, to murder the fellow|creature
who, though wantonly, and mu&s;t unju&s;|tifiably,
and wickedly, hath made inroads upon
the property of his neighbour This is puni&s;hing
beyond the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of <HI>rigour,</HI> and much
more beyond the line of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye &s;hedders of blood, what motives can ye have, for &s;till preaching up the doctrine of capital puni&s;hments, and putting your doctrine in practice? Ye cannot plead the pre|vention of crimes: for experience mu&s;t convince you, that all your &s;anguinary laws are but a feeble fence again&s;t the wor&s;t crimes. And the rea&s;on of this is evident. Labour, and not death, is the great evil, which the malefactor dreads. Make, then, the malefactor work, and you will have no malefactors. Nor will ye then, while ye would be ac|counted the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, mo&s;t &s;hamefully oppo&s;e, both the example and the laws of Chri&s;t.

ju&s;tice is &s;o far from bearing any kind of
&s;imilitude to this, that it is, we have &s;een, entirely
contrary to it. The divine ju&s;tice is &s;low to pu|ni&s;h

and long-&s;uffering towards them, at fir&s;t
only puni&s;heth them with the accu&s;ations of con|&s;cience,

ready to blot out all their iniquities, to receive
them into favour, and to admit them to the riches
of eternal life. We &s;hould, therefore, to copy af|ter
the divine ju&s;tice, proportion our mode of pu|ni&s;hment
to the offence that is committed; we
&s;hould aim at the reformation of the &s;inner, and
endeavour to make his &s;ituation &s;uch, as will both
an&s;wer this end, and at the &s;ame time repay &s;ociety
for the wrongs he has done. Or, while we do
<HI>ju&s;tly</HI> towards all, and injure no man in body or
e&s;tate, we &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;hew <HI>mercy</HI> to the guilty,
and forgive them when they repent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the author had written the&s;e &s;heets, he turned to a di&s;cour&s;e of the great Abernethy upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; from whom he has tran&s;cribed the following pa&s;&s;age, being, in his apprehen&s;ion, perfectly in point with the &s;entiments delivered in the above paragraph. <Q>God, in his ju&s;tice,</Q> &s;aid this mo&s;t learned and excellent man, <Q>as well as his other moral perfections, is the be&s;t example for us to imi|tate, as far as the frailty of our nature will allow.

<P>But, thirdly, from the view that we have here
taken of the divine ju&s;tice, we may &s;ee that there
was none occa&s;ion for that infinite &s;atisfaction for
&s;in, which, among many other &s;trange inventions,
the bu&s;y children of men have found out, and &s;till
confidently proclaim to the world. The divine
<PB N="28" REF="29">
ju&s;tice is &s;urrounded with mercy. The divine
ju&s;tice, therefore, is fully &s;atisfied with the refor|mation
of the offender. The divine ju&s;tice &s;itteth
upon a throne of grace, to which every contrite
&s;inner has free acce&s;s, has <HI>always</HI> free acce&s;s. And
if mercy was not to be obtained thence, where el&s;e
could it po&s;&s;ibly be found? Could any other being,
could all the other beings, in the univer&s;e, over|power
the infinite mind? Could any other
being be more benevolent than he? Or, indeed,
dare any other being pre&s;ume to direct him, to al|ter
the purpo&s;e he had formed? But there was not
any occa&s;ion for any other being to attempt this.
God was <HI>of him&s;elf</HI> eternally di&s;po&s;ed to have mercy
upon us, and was <HI>never</HI> willing that any &s;hould pe|ri&s;h,
but that all &s;hould come to repentance and
eternal life. Nay, &s;o far was he from being ir|reconcileable
to his creatures, or from demanding
an infinite &s;atisfaction for every &s;in, that he, <HI>of his
own will, gave us his only begotten &s;on,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure us,
that, upon our &s;incere repentance, all our &s;ins
&s;hould be blotted out, and that, upon our renewed
obedience, we &s;hould be made partakers of eternal
life. <Q><HI>God</HI> &s;o loved the world, that <HI>he</HI> gave us his
only begotten &s;on, that whoever believeth in him,
might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</Q> Or,
this is his covenant with us, <HI>Repent, and live ye,</HI>
and <HI>turn unto me, and I will turn unto you.</HI> The
ble&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t has &s;ealed, or ratified to us,
this covenant with his own blood, that is, by his
death and re&s;urrection. The everla&s;ting Jehovah,
has rai&s;ed Chri&s;t from the dead, to a&s;&s;ure us, that
he has &s;ent him, and that he will, con&s;equently,
fulfil, to the truly penitent, all tho&s;e promi&s;es of
pardon, peace, and love, and everla&s;ting &s;alvation

in the heavens, which are given to us in his holy
word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Why, if &s;uch a doctrine has any foundation in truth, have we no account in the &s;criptures of this infinite &s;atisfac|tion for &s;in? Why, if this be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, is it not &s;o much as mentioned in tho&s;e books that are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation? Why did not Nathan, when he was &s;ent to David to di&s;play to him the pardoning mercy of God, refer him to &s;uch a &s;atisfaction as the only means of e&s;caping the wrath to come? Why did not David him&s;elf, when he humbled him&s;elf before God for his great tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, rely upon any &s;uch &s;atisfaction, nor &s;peak of any &s;uch &s;atisfaction, but pray for <HI>a clean heart and a right &s;pirit?</HI> Why, after Chri&s;t died, did all the apo&s;tles, in&s;tead of referring &s;inners to &s;uch a &s;atisfaction, teach them, <HI>that denying ungod|line&s;s, and worldly lu&s;t, they &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world?</HI> Why did Paul in particular, who gloried &s;o much in preaching Chri&s;t, expre&s;ly declare that <HI>if, while we &s;eek to be ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t, we our&s;elves are found &s;inners, we deceive our&s;elves?</HI> Without &s;hewing at large, that this notion of a &s;atisfaction de&s;troys all di&s;tinction of charac|ter, and expunges every idea of the malignity of evil, why did not our Lord him&s;elf, who was the true way to eternal life, ever recommend any other means of attaining the mercy of God, than a &s;incere repentance, and a thorough reformation? He certainly foreknew that he was to &s;uffer death, and re|peatedly intimated this to his di&s;ciples; but, in none of his conver&s;ations upon this &s;ubject, did he in the lea&s;t in&s;inuate that his death would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God, or that it was to be con&s;idered as an indi&s;pen&s;able pre|requi&s;ite to appea&s;e his wrath. Accordingly, he did not pray to God, that &s;inners might learn to rely upon the merits of his blood, but that the apo&s;tles might be kept from falling, and he prayed for all who &s;hould believe on him through their word. He likewi&s;e, in the la&s;t &s;cene of all, prayed for very murderers&mdash;<HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI> But, to what purpo&s;e any of the&s;e prayers, if the ju&s;tice of God was fully &s;atisfied by the death of his &s;on? Our Lord would not then, &s;urely, have prayed for criminals, but would, as he had the &s;pirit above mea&s;ure, and as he could not therefore be deceived, have demanded their for|givene&s;s as his purcha&s;ed right.</NOTE></P>

But, finally, the doctrine we have been con&s;i|dering
can afford no kind of encouragement to
the &s;inner. On the contrary, the goodne&s;s, for|bearance,
and long-&s;uffering of God, &s;hould, above
all things, lead him to repentance. Be&s;ides, though
God is gracious, &s;low to anger, and ready to for|give,
yet he will at la&s;t take vengeance upon his ad|ver&s;aries,
upon tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;ed his grace, and
rejected all the offers of his mercy. This he hath
repeatedly, and &s;olemnly declared, <HI>There is no

mercy will render judgment nece&s;&s;ary, and that
infinite goodne&s;s will execute all the threatenings
