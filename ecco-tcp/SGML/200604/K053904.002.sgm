</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WRAPT in Olivia's veil, Ellena de|&s;cended
to the mu&s;ic-room, and min|gled
with the nuns, who were a&s;&s;embled
within the grate. Among the monks
and pilgrims without it, were &s;ome &s;tran|gers
in the u&s;ual dre&s;s of the country,
but &s;he did not perceive any per&s;on who
re&s;embled Vivaldi; and &s;he con&s;idered,
that, if he were pre&s;ent, he would not
venture to di&s;cover him&s;elf, while her nun's
veil concealed her as effectually from him
<PB N="2" REF="3">
as from the lady Abbe&s;s. It would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
therefore, to &s;eek an opportunity
of withdrawing it for a moment at the
grate, an expedient, which mu&s;t certainly
expo&s;e her to the notice of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>On the entrance of the lady Abbe&s;s,
Ellena's fear of ob&s;ervation rendered her in|&s;en&s;ible
to every other con&s;ideration; &s;he
fancied, that the eyes of the Superior were
particularly directed upon her&s;elf. The
veil &s;eemed an in&s;ufficient protection from
their penetrating glances, and &s;he almo&s;t
&s;unk with the terror of in&s;tant di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The Abbe&s;s, however, pa&s;&s;ed on, and,
having conver&s;ed for a few moments with
the <HI>padre Abate</HI> and &s;ome vi&s;itors of di&s;|tinction,
took her chair; and the per|formance
immediately opened with one of
tho&s;e &s;olemn and impre&s;&s;ive airs, which
the Italian nuns know how to give with &s;o
much ta&s;te and &s;weetne&s;s. It re&s;cued even
Ellena for a moment from a &s;en&s;e of dan|ger,
and &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the &s;ur|rounding
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;cene, of which the <HI>coup-d' oeil.</HI>
was &s;triking and grand. In a vaulted
apartment of con&s;iderable extent, lighted
by innumerable tapers, and where even
the ornaments, though pompous, partook
of the &s;olemn character of the in&s;titution,
were a&s;&s;embled about fifty nuns, who, in
the intere&s;ting habit of their order, ap|peared
with graceful plainne&s;s. The deli|cacy
of their air, and their beauty, &s;oftened
by the lawn that thinly veiled it, were con|tra&s;ted
by the &s;evere maje&s;ty of the lady
Abbe&s;s, who, &s;eated on an elevated chair,
apart from the audience, &s;eemed the Em|pre&s;s
of the &s;cene, and by the venerable
figures of the father <HI>Abate</HI> and his attendant
monks, who were arranged without that
&s;creen of wire-work, extending the whole
breadth of the apartment, which is called
the grate. Near the holy father were
placed the &s;trangers of di&s;tinction, dre&s;&s;ed
in the &s;plendid Neapolitan habit, who&s;e
gay colouring and airy elegance oppo&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="5">
well with the dark drapery of the eccle&s;ia&s;|tics;
their plumed hats loftily overtopping
the half-cowled heads and grey locks of the
monks. Nor was the contra&s;t of counte|nances
le&s;s &s;triking; the grave, the au&s;tere,
the &s;olemn, and the gloomy, intermingling
with the light, the blooming, and the de|bonaire,
expre&s;&s;ed all the various tempers,
that render life a ble&s;&s;ing or a burden, and,
as with the &s;pell of magic, transform this
world into a tran&s;ient paradi&s;e or purgatory.
In the back ground of the picture &s;tood
&s;ome pilgrims, with looks le&s;s joyous and
more demure than they had worn on the
road the preceding day; and among them
were &s;ome inferior brothers and attendants
of the convent. To this part of the cham|ber
Ellena frequently directed her atten|tion,
but did not di&s;tingui&s;h Vivaldi; and,
though &s;he had taken a &s;tation near the
grate, &s;he had not courage indecorou&s;ly
to withdraw her veil before &s;o many &s;tran|gers.
And thus, if he even were in the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
apartment, it was not probable he would
venture to come forward.</P>
<P>The concert concluded without his hav|ing
been di&s;covered by Ellena; and &s;he
withdrew to the apartment, where the
collation was &s;pread, and where the Abbe&s;s
and her gue&s;ts &s;oon after appeared. Pre|&s;ently,
&s;he ob&s;erved a &s;tranger, in a pil|grim's
habit, &s;tation him&s;elf near the grate;
his face was partly muffled in his cloak,
and he &s;eemed to be a &s;pectator rather than
a partaker of the fea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ellena, who under&s;tood this to be Vi|valdi,
was watchful for an opportunity of
approaching, un&s;een by the Abbe&s;s; the
place where he had fixed him&s;elf. Engag|ed
in conver&s;ation with the ladies around
her, the Superior &s;oon favoured Ellena's
wi&s;h, who, having reached the grate, ven|tured
to lift her veil for one in&s;tant. The
&s;tranger, letting his cloak fall, thanked her
with his eyes for her conde&s;cen&s;ion, and
&s;he perceived, that he was not Vivaldi!
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Shocked at the interpretation, which might
be given to a conduct apparently &s;o impro|per,
as much as by the di&s;appointment,
which Vivaldi's ab&s;ence occa&s;ioned, &s;he
was ha&s;tily retiring, when another &s;tranger
approached with quick &s;teps, whom &s;he in&s;tantly
knew, by the grace and &s;pirit of his
air, to be Vivaldi; but, determined not to
expo&s;e her&s;elf a &s;econd time to the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of a mi&s;take, &s;he awaited for &s;ome fur|ther
&s;ignal of his identity, before &s;he di&s;|covered
her&s;elf. His eyes were fixed upon
her in earne&s;t attention for &s;ome moments,
before he drew a&s;ide the cloak from his face.
But he &s;oon did &s;o:&mdash;and it was&punc; Vivaldi
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ellena, perceiving that &s;he was known,
did not rai&s;e her veil, but advanced a few
&s;teps towards the grate. Vivaldi there de|po&s;ited
a &s;mall folded paper, and before
&s;he could venture to deliver her own billet,
he had retired among the crowd. As &s;he
&s;tepped forward to &s;ecure his letter, &s;he
<PB N="7" REF="8">
ob&s;erved a nun ha&s;tily approach the &s;pot
where he had laid it, and &s;he pau&s;ed. The
garment of the Reclu&s;e wafted it from the
place where it had been partly concealed;
and when Ellena perceived the nun's foot
re&s;t upon the paper, &s;he with difficulty
di&s;gui&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>A friar, who from without the grate ad|dre&s;&s;ed
the &s;i&s;ter, &s;eemed with much ear|ne&s;tne&s;s,
yet with a certain air of &s;ecre&s;y,
communicating &s;ome important intelli|gence.
The fears of Ellena &s;ugge&s;ted that
he had ob&s;erved the action of Vivaldi, and
was making known his &s;u&s;picions; and &s;he
expected, every in&s;tant, to &s;ee the nun lift
up the paper, and deliver it to the Abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>From this immediate apprehen&s;ion, how|ever,
&s;he was relea&s;ed when the &s;i&s;ter
pu&s;hed it gently a&s;ide, without examina|tion,
a circum&s;tance that not le&s;s &s;urprized
than relieved her. But, when the confe|rence
broke up, and the friar, ha&s;tily
retreating among the crowd, di&s;appeared
<PB N="8" REF="9">
from the apartment, and the nun ap|proached
and whi&s;pered the Superior, all
her terrors were renewed. She &s;carcely
doubted, that Vivaldi was detected, and
that his letter was de&s;ignedly left where it
had been depo&s;ited, for the purpo&s;e of al|luring
her to betray her&s;elf. Trembling,
di&s;mayed, and almo&s;t &s;inking with appre|hen&s;ion,
&s;he watched the countenance of
the Abbe&s;s, while the nun addre&s;&s;ed her,
and thought &s;he read her own fate in the
frown that appeared there.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the intentions or the
directions of the Superior, no active mea|&s;ure
was at pre&s;ent employed; the Reclu&s;e,
having received an an&s;wer, retired quietly
among the &s;i&s;ters, and the Abbe&s;s re&s;umed
her u&s;ual manner. Ellena, however, &s;up|po&s;ing
&s;he was now ob&s;erved, did not dare
to &s;eize the paper, though &s;he believed it
contained momentous information, and
feared that the time was now e&s;caping,
which might facilitate her deliverance.
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Whenever &s;he ventured to look round,
the eyes of the Abbe&s;s &s;eemed pointed up|on
her, and &s;he judged from the po&s;ition
of the nun, for the veil concealed her face,
that &s;he al&s;o was vigilantly regarding her.</P>
<P>Above an hour had elap&s;ed in this &s;tate
of anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when the collation
concluded, and the a&s;&s;embly broke up;
during the general bu&s;tle of which, Ellena
ventured to the grate, and &s;ecured the pa|per.
As &s;he concealed it in her robe, &s;he
&s;carcely dared to enquire by a ha&s;ty glance
whether &s;he had been ob&s;erved, and would
have withdrawn immediately to examine
the contents, had &s;he not perceived, at the
&s;ame in&s;tant, the Abbe&s;s quitting the apart|ment.
On looking round for the nun, El|lena
di&s;covered that &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>Ellena followed di&s;tantly in the Abbe&s;s's
train; and, as &s;he drew nearer to Olivia, gave
a &s;ignal, and pa&s;&s;ed on to her cell. There,
once more alone, and having &s;ecured the
door, &s;he &s;at down to read Vivaldi's billet,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
trying to command her impatience, and to
under&s;tand the lines, over which her &s;ight
rapidly moved, when in the eagerne&s;s of
turning over the paper, the lamp dropt
from her trembling hand and expired.
Her di&s;tre&s;s now nearly reached de&s;pair.
To go forth into the convent for a light
was utterly impracticable, &s;ince it would
betray that &s;he was no longer a pri&s;oner,
and not only would Olivia &s;uffer from a
di&s;covery of the indulgence &s;he had grant|ed,
but &s;he her&s;elf would be immediately
confined. Her only hope re&s;ted upon Oli|via's
arrival before it might be too late to
practice the in&s;tructions of Vivaldi, if, in|deed,
they were &s;till practicable; and &s;he
li&s;tened with inten&s;e &s;olicitude for an ap|proaching
foot&s;tep, while &s;he yet held, ig|norant
of its contents, the billet, that pro|bably
would decide her fate. A thou&s;and
times &s;he turned about the eventful paper,
endeavoured to trace the lines with her fin|gers,
and to gue&s;s their import, thus enve|loped
<PB N="11" REF="12">
in my&s;tery; while &s;he experienced
all the various torture that the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of having in her very hand the infor|mation,
on a timely knowledge of which
her life, perhaps, depended, without being
able to under&s;tand it, could inflict.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently &s;he heard advancing &s;teps, and
a light gleamed from the pa&s;&s;age before &s;he
con&s;idered they might be &s;ome other than
Olivia's; and that it was prudent to con|ceal
the billet &s;he held. The con&s;idera|tion,
however, came too late to be acted
upon; for, before the ru&s;tling paper was
di&s;po&s;ed of, a per&s;on entered the cell, and
Ellena beheld her friend. Pale, trembling,
and &s;ilent, &s;he took the lamp form the nun,
and, eagerly running over Vivaldi's note,
learned, that at the time it was written, bro|ther
Jeronimo was in waiting without the
gate of the nun's garden, where Vivaldi de|&s;igned
to join him immediately, and con|duct
her by a private way beyond the walls.
He added, that hor&s;es were &s;tationed at the
<PB N="12" REF="13">
foot of the mountain, to convey her where|ever
&s;he &s;hould judge proper; and conjured
her to be expeditious, &s;ince other circum|&s;tances,
be&s;ides the univer&s;al engagement
of the Reclu&s;es, were at that moment parti|cularly
favourable to an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Ellena, de&s;ponding and appalled, gave
the paper to Olivia, reque&s;ting &s;he would
read it ha&s;tily, and advi&s;e her how to act.
It was now an hour and a half &s;ince Vival|di
had &s;aid, that &s;ucce&s;s depended upon ex|pedition,
and that he had probably watch|ed
at the appointed place; in &s;uch an in|terval,
how many circum&s;tances might
have occurred to de&s;troy every po&s;&s;ibility
of a retreat, which it was certain the en|gagement
of the Abbe&s;s and the &s;i&s;ters no
longered favoured!</P>
<P>The generous Olivia, having read the
billet, partook of all her young friend's di&s;|tre&s;s,
and was as willing, as Ellena was
anxious, to dare every danger for the
chance of obtaining deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
Ellena could feel gratitude for &s;uch
goodne&s;s even at this moment of agoniz|ing
apprehen&s;ion. After a pau&s;e of deep
con&s;ideration, Olivia &s;aid, "In every ave|nue
of the convent we are now liable to
meet &s;ome of the nuns; but my veil,
though thin, has hitherto protected you,
and we mu&s;t hope it may &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;t your
purpo&s;e. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to
pa&s;s through the refectory, where &s;uch of
the &s;i&s;ters as did not partake of the colla|tion,
are a&s;&s;embled at &s;upper, and will re|main
&s;o, till the fir&s;t mattin calls them
to the chapel. If we wait till then, I fear
it will be to no purpo&s;e to go at all."</P>
<P>Ellena's fears perfectly agreed with tho&s;e
of Olivia; and entreating that another mo|ment
might not be lo&s;t in he&s;itation, and
that &s;he would lead the way to the nun's
garden, they quitted the cell together.</P>
<P>Several of the &s;i&s;ters pa&s;&s;ed them, as they
de&s;cended to the refectory, but without
particularly noticing Ellena; who, as &s;he
<PB N="14" REF="15">
drew near that alarming apartment, wrapt
her veil clo&s;er, and leaned with heavier
pre&s;&s;ure upon the arm of her faithful friend.
At the door they were met by the Abbe&s;s,
who had been overlooking the nuns a&s;&s;em|bled
at &s;upper, and mi&s;&s;ing Olivia had en|quired
for her. Ellena &s;hrunk back to
elude ob&s;ervation, and to let the Superior
pa&s;s; but Olivia was obliged to an&s;wer to
the &s;ummons. Having, however, unveiled
her&s;elf, &s;he was permitted to proceed; and
Ellena, who had mingled with the crowd
that &s;urrounded the Abbe&s;s, and thus e&s;|caped
detection, followed Olivia with fal|tering
&s;teps, through the refectory. The
nuns were luckily too much engaged by
the entertainment, at this moment, to
look round them, and the fugitive reach|ed,
un&s;u&s;pected, an oppo&s;ite door.</P>
<P>In the hall, to which they de&s;cended,
the adventurers were frequently cro&s;&s;ed by
&s;ervants bearing di&s;hes from the refectory
to the kitchen; and, at the very moment
<PB N="15" REF="16">
when they were opening the door, that led
into the garden, a &s;i&s;ter, who had ob&s;erved
them, demanded whether they had vet
heard the mattin-bell, &s;ince they were go|ing
towards the chapel.</P>
<P>Terrified at this critical interruption,
Ellena pre&s;&s;ed Olivia's arm, in &s;ignal of &s;i|lence,
and was ha&s;tening forward, when the
latter, more prudent, pau&s;ed, and calmly
an&s;wering the que&s;tion, was then &s;uffered to
proceed.</P>
<P>As they cro&s;&s;ed the garden towards the
gate, Ellena's anxiety le&s;t Vivaldi &s;hould
have been compelled to leave it, encrea&s;ed
&s;o much, that &s;he had &s;carcely power to
proceed. "O if my &s;trength &s;hould fail
before I reach it!" &s;he &s;aid &s;oftly to Olivia,
"or if I &s;hould reach it too late!"</P>
<P>Olivia tried to cheer her, and pointed
out the gate, on which the moonlight fell;
"At the end of this walk only," &s;aid Olivia,
"&s;ee!&mdash;where the &s;hadows of the trees
open, is our goal."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
Encouraged by the view of it, Ellena
fled with lighter &s;teps along the alley; but
the gate &s;eemed to mock her approach, and
to retreat before her. Fatigue overtook her
in this long alley, before &s;he could overtake
the &s;pot &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought, and, breath|le&s;s
and exhau&s;ted, &s;he was once more
compelled to &s;top, and once more in the
agony of terror exclaimed&mdash;"O, if my
&s;trength &s;hould fail before I reach it!&mdash;O,
if I &s;hould drop even while it is within my
view."</P>
<P>The pau&s;e of a moment enabled her to
proceed, and &s;he &s;topped not again till &s;he
arrived at the gate; when Olivia &s;ugge&s;ted
the prudence of a&s;certaining who was with|out,
and of receiving an an&s;wer to the &s;ig|nal,
which Vivaldi had propo&s;ed, before
they ventured to make them&s;elves known.
She then &s;truck upon the wood, and, in the
anxious pau&s;e that followed, whi&s;pering
voices were di&s;tinctly heard from without,
but no &s;ignal &s;poke in reply to the nun's.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
"We are betrayed!" &s;aid Ellena &s;oftly,
"but I will know the wor&s;t at once;" and
&s;he repeated the &s;ignal, when, to her un|&s;peakable
joy, it was an&s;wered by three
&s;mart raps upon the gate. Olivia, more
di&s;tru&s;tful, would have checked the &s;ud|den
hope of her friend, till &s;ome further
proof had appeared, that it was Vivaldi
who waited without, but her precaution
came too late; a key already grated in the
lock; the door opened, and two per&s;ons
muffled in their garments appeared at it.
Ellena was ha&s;tily retreating, when a well-known
voice recalled her, and &s;he perceiv|ed,
by the rays of a half-hooded lamp,
which Jeronimo held, Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"O heavens!" he exclaimed, in a voice
tremulous with joy, as he took her hand,
"is it po&s;&s;ible that you are again my own!
If you could but know what I have &s;uffer|ed
during this la&s;t hour!"&mdash;Then ob&s;erv|ing
Olivia, he drew back, till Ellena ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="19">
her deep &s;en&s;e of obligation to the
nun.</P>
<P>"We have no time to lo&s;e," &s;aid Jeroni|mo
&s;ullenly; "we have &s;tayed too long al|ready,
as you will find, perhaps."</P>
<P>"Farewel, dear Ellena!" &s;aid Olivia,
"may the protection of heaven never leave
you!"</P>
<P>The fears of Ellena now gave way to
affectionate &s;orrow, as, weeping on the
bo&s;om of the nun, &s;he &s;aid "farewel! O
farewel, my dear, my tender friend! I mu&s;t
never, never &s;ee you more, but I &s;hall always
love you; and you have promi&s;ed, that I
&s;hall hear from you; remember the con|vent
della Pieta!"</P>
<P>"You &s;hould have &s;ettled this matter
within," &s;aid Jeronimo, "we have been
here the&s;e two hours already."</P>
<P>"Ah Ellena!" &s;aid Vivaldi, as he gently
di&s;engaged her from the nun, "do I then
hold only the &s;econd place in your heart?"</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
Ellena, as &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her tears, replied
with a &s;mile more eloquent than words;
and when &s;he had again and again bade
adieu to Olivia, &s;he gave him her hand,
and quitted the gate.</P>
<P>"It is moonlight," ob&s;erved Vivaldi to
Jeronimo, "your lamp is u&s;ele&s;s, and may
betray us."</P>
<P>"It will be nece&s;&s;ary in the church," re|plied
Jeronimo, "and in &s;ome circuitous
avenues we mu&s;t pa&s;s, for I dare not lead
you out through the great gates, Signor&punc;
as you well know."</P>
<P>"Lead on, then," replied Vivaldi, and
they reached one of the cypre&s;s walks, that
extended to the church; but, before they
entered it, Ellena pau&s;ed and looked back
to the garden gate, that &s;he might &s;ee Oli|via
once again. The nun was &s;till there,
and Ellena perceived her faintly in the
moonlight, waving her hand in &s;ignal of a
la&s;t adieu. Ellena's heart was full; &s;he
wept, and lingered, and returned the &s;ig|nal,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
till the gentle violence of Vivaldi with|drew
her from the &s;pot.</P>
<P>"I envy your friend tho&s;e tears," &s;aid
he, "and feel jealous of the tenderne&s;s that
excites them. Weep no more, my El|lena."</P>
<P>"If you knew her worth," replied El|lena,
"and the obligations I owe her!"&mdash;Her
voice was lo&s;t in &s;ighs, and Vivaldi
only pre&s;&s;ed her hand in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>As they traver&s;ed the gloomy walk, that
led to the church, Vivaldi &s;aid, "Are you
certain, father, that not any of the brothers
are doing penance at the &s;hrines in our
way?"</P>
<P>"Doing penance on a fe&s;tival, Signor!
they are more likely, by this time, to be
taking down the ornaments."</P>
<P>"That would be equally unfortunate
for us," &s;aid Vivaldi; "cannot we avoid
the church, father?"</P>
<P>Jeronimo a&s;&s;ured him, that this was im|po&s;&s;ible;
and they immediately entered
<PB N="21" REF="22">
one of its lonely ai&s;les, where he unhooded
the lamp, for the tapers, which had given
&s;plendour, at an earlier hour, to the nu|merous
&s;hrines, had expired, except tho&s;e
at the high altar, which were &s;o remote,
that their rays faded into twilight long be|fore
they reached the part of the church
where the fugitives pa&s;&s;ed. Here and
there, indeed, a dying lamp &s;hot a tremu|lous
gleam upon the &s;hrine below, and va|ni&s;hed
again, &s;erving to mark the di&s;tances
in the long per&s;pective of arches, rather
than to enlighten the gloomy &s;olitude;
but no &s;ound, not even of a whi&s;per, &s;tole
along the pavement.</P>
<P>They cro&s;&s;ed to a &s;ide door communi|cating
with the court, and with the rock,
which en&s;hrined the image of <HI>our Lady of
mount Carmel.</HI> There, the &s;udden glare of
tapers i&s;&s;uing from the cave, alarmed the
fugitives, who had begun to retreat, when
Jeronimo, &s;tepping forward to examine the
place, a&s;&s;ured them, there was no &s;ymp|tom
<PB N="22" REF="23">
of any per&s;on being within, and that
lights burned day and night around the
&s;hrine.</P>
<P>Revived by this explanation, they fol|lowed
into the cave, where their conduc|tor
opened a part of the wire-work enclo&s;|ing
the &s;aint, and led them to the extremity
of the vault, &s;unk deep within which ap|peared
a &s;mall door. While Ellena trem|bled
with apprehen&s;ion, Jeronimo applied
a key, and they perceived, beyond the
door, a narrow pa&s;&s;age winding away into
the rock. The monk was leading on, but
Vivaldi, who had the &s;u&s;picions of Ellena,
pau&s;ed at the entrance, and demanded
whither he was conducting them.</P>
<P>To the place of your <HI>de&s;tination,</HI>" replied
the brother, in a hollow voice; an an&s;wer
which alarmed Ellena, and did not &s;atisfy
Vivaldi. "I have given my&s;elf to your
guidance," he &s;aid, "and have confided
to you what is dearer to me than exi&s;tence.
Your life," pointing to the &s;hort &s;word
<PB N="23" REF="24">
concealed beneath his pilgrim's ve&s;t, "your
life, you may rely upon my word, &s;hall
an&s;wer for your treachery. If your pur|po&s;e
is evil, pau&s;e a moment, and repent,
or you &s;hall not quit this pa&s;&s;age alive."</P>
<P>"Do you menace me!" replied the
brother, his countenance darkening. "Of
what &s;ervice would be my death to you?
Do you not know that every brother in the
convent would ri&s;e to avenge it?"</P>
<P>"I know only that I will make &s;ure of
one-traitor, if there be one," &s;aid Vivaldi,
"and defend this lady again&s;t your ho&s;t of
monks; and, &s;ince you al&s;o know this,
proceed accordingly."</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant it occurring to Ellena, that
the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion probably led to the
pri&s;on-chamber, which Olivia had de&s;cribed
as &s;ituated within &s;ome deep rece&s;s of the
convent, and that Jeronimo had certainly
betrayed them, &s;he refu&s;ed to go further.
"If your purpo&s;e is hone&s;t," &s;aid &s;he,
"why do you not conduct us through
<PB N="24" REF="25">
&s;ome direct gate of the convent; why are
we brought into the&s;e &s;ubterraneous laby|rinths?"</P>
<P>There is no direct gate but that of the
portal," Jeronimo replied, "and this is
the only other avenue leading beyond the
walls." "And why can we not go out
through the portal?" Vivaldi a&s;ked.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e it is be&s;et with pilgrims, and
lay brothers," replied Jeronimo, "and
though you might pa&s;s them &s;afely enough,
what is to become of the lady? But all
this you knew before, Signor; and was
willing enough to tru&s;t me, then. The
pa&s;&s;age we are entering opens upon the
cliffs, at &s;ome di&s;tance. I have run ha|zard
enough already, and will wa&s;te no
more time; &s;o if you do not chu&s;e to go
forward, I will leave you, and you may act
as you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>He concluded with a laugh of deri&s;ion,
and was re-locking the door, when Vivaldi,
alarmed for the probable con&s;equence of
<PB N="25" REF="26">
his re&s;entment, and &s;omewhat re-a&s;&s;ured by
the indifference he di&s;covered as to their
pur&s;uing the avenue or not, endeavoured
to appea&s;e him, as well as to encourage
Ellena; and he &s;ucceeded in both.</P>
<P>As he followed in &s;ilence through the
gloomy pa&s;&s;age, his doubts were, however,
not &s;o wholly vanqui&s;hed, but that he
was prepared for attack, and while he &s;up|ported
Ellena with one hand, he held his
&s;word in the other.</P>
<P>The avenue was of con&s;iderable length&punc;
and before they reached its extremity, they
heard mu&s;ic from a di&s;tance, winding
along the rocks. "Hark!" cried Ellena,
"Whence come tho&s;e &s;ounds? Li&s;|ten!"</P>
<P>"From the cave we have left," replied
Jeronimo, "and it is midnight by that;
it is the la&s;t chaunt of the pilgrims at the
&s;hrine of our Lady. Make ha&s;te, Signor,
I &s;hall be called for."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
The fugitives now perceived, that all
retreat was cut off, and that, if they had
lingered only a few moments longer in the
cave, they &s;hould have been &s;urprized by
tho&s;e devotees, &s;ome one of whom, how|ever,
it appeared po&s;&s;ible might wander
into this avenue, and &s;till interrupt their
e&s;cape. When Vivaldi told his apprehen|sions,
Jeronimo, with an arch &s;neer, affirm|ed
there was no danger of that, "for the
pa&s;&s;age," he added, "is known only to
the brothers of the convent."</P>
<P>Vivaldi's doubts vani&s;hed when he fur|ther
under&s;tood, that the avenue led only
from the cliffs without to the cave, and
was u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of conveying &s;e|cretly
to the &s;hrine, &s;uch articles as were
judged nece&s;&s;ary to excite the &s;uper&s;titious
wonder of the devotees.</P>
<P>While he proceeded in thoughtful
&s;ilence, a di&s;tant chime &s;ounded hollowly
through the chambers of the rock. "The
<PB N="27" REF="28">
mattin-bell &s;trikes!" &s;aid Jeronimo, in
&s;eeming alarm, "I am &s;ummoned. Sig|nora
quicken your &s;teps;" an unnece&s;&s;ary
reque&s;t, for Ellena already pa&s;&s;ed with
her utmo&s;t &s;peed; and &s;he now rejoiced
on perceiving a door in the remote wind|ing
of the pa&s;&s;age, which &s;he believed
would emancipate her from the convent.
But, as &s;he advanced, the avenue appear|ed
extending beyond it; and the door,
which &s;tood a little open allowed her a
glimp&s;e of a chamber in the cliff, du&s;kily
lighted.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, alarmed by the light, enquired,
when he had pa&s;&s;ed, whether any per&s;on
was in the chamber, and received an equi|vocal
an&s;wer from Jeronimo, who, how|ever,
&s;oon after pointed to an arched gate
that terminated the avenue. They pro|ceeded
with lighter &s;teps, for hope now
cheared their hearts, and, on reaching the
gate, all apprehen&s;ion vani&s;hed. Jeroni|mo
gave the lamp to Vivaldi, while he
<PB N="28" REF="29">
began to unbar and unlock the door, and
Vivaldi had prepared to reward the brother
for his fidelity, before they perceived that
the door refu&s;ed to yield. A dreadful ima|gination
&s;eized on Vivaldi. Jeronimo
turning round, coolly &s;aid, "I fear we
are betrayed; the &s;econd lock is &s;hot! I
have only the key of the fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"We <HI>are</HI> betrayed," &s;aid Vivaldi, in a
re&s;olute tone, "but do not &s;uppo&s;e, that
your di&s;&s;imulation conceals you. I under|&s;tand
by whom we are betrayed. Recollect
my late a&s;&s;ertion, and con&s;ider once more,
whether it is your intere&s;t to intercept us."</P>
<P>"My Signor," replied Jeronimo, "I
do not deceive you when I prote&s;t by our
holy Saint, that I have not cau&s;ed this
gate to be fa&s;tened, and that I would open
it if I could. The lock, which holds it,
was not &s;hot an hour ago. I am the more
&s;urprized at what has happened, becau&s;e
this place is &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed, even by the
holie&s;t foot&s;tep; and I fear, whoever has
<PB N="29" REF="30">
pa&s;&s;ed now, has been led hither by &s;u&s;pi|cion,
and comes to intercept your flight."</P>
<P>"Your wily explanation, brother, may
&s;erve you for an inferior occa&s;ion, but not
on this," replied Vivaldi, "either, there|fore,
unclo&s;e the gate, or prepare for the
wor&s;t. You are not now to learn, that,
however &s;lightly I may e&s;timate my own
life, I will never abandon this lady to the
horrors, which your community have al|ready
prepared for her."</P>
<P>Ellena, &s;ummoning her fleeting &s;pirits,
endeavoured to calm the indignation of Vi|valdi,
and to prevent the con&s;equence of
his &s;u&s;picions, as well as to prevail with Je|ronimo,
to unfa&s;ten the gate. Her efforts
were, however, followed by a long alterca|tion;
but, at length, the art or the inno|cence
of the brother, appea&s;ed Vivaldi,
who now endeavoured to force the gate,
while Jeronimo in vain repre&s;ented its
&s;trength, and the certain ruin, that mu&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="31">
fall upon him&s;elf, if it &s;hould be di&s;covered
he had concurred in de&s;troying it.</P>
<P>The gate was immoveable; but, as no
other chance of e&s;caping appeared, Vival|di
was not ea&s;ily prevailed with to de&s;i&s;t;
all po&s;&s;ibility of retreating too was gone,
&s;ince the church and the cave were now
crowded with devotees, attending the mat|tin
&s;ervice.</P>
<P>Jeronimo, however, &s;eemingly did not
de&s;pair of effecting their relea&s;e, but he ac|knowledged
that they would probably be
compelled to remain concealed in this
gloomy avenue all night, and perhaps the
next day. At length, it was agreed, that
he &s;hould return to the church, to examine
whether a po&s;&s;ibility remained of the fugi|tives
pa&s;&s;ing unob&s;erved to the great por|tal;
and, having conducted them back to
the chamber, of which they had taken
a pa&s;&s;ing glimp&s;e, he proceeded to the
&s;hrine,</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">
For a con&s;iderable time after his de|parture,
they were not without hope; but,
their confidence dimini&s;hing as his delay
encrea&s;ed, their uncertainty at length be|came
terrible; and it was only for the
&s;ake of Vivaldi, from whom &s;he &s;crupu|lou&s;ly
concealed all knowledge of the par|ticular
fate, which &s;he was aware mu&s;t
await her in the convent, that Ellena ap|peared
to endure it with calmne&s;s. Not|with&s;tanding
the plau&s;ibility of Jeronimo,
&s;u&s;picion of his treachery returned upon
her mind. The cold and earthy air of this
chamber was like that of a &s;epulchre; and
when &s;he looked round, it appeared exact|ly
to corre&s;pond with the de&s;cription given
by Olivia of the pri&s;on where the nun had
langui&s;hed and expired. It was walled
and vaulted with the rock, had only one
&s;mall grated aperture in the roof to admit
air, and contained no furniture, except one
table, a bench, and the lamp, which dim|ly
&s;hewed the apartment. That a lamp
<PB N="32" REF="33">
&s;hould be found burning in a place &s;o re|mote
and &s;olitary, amazed her &s;till more
when &s;he recollected the a&s;&s;ertion of Jero|nimo,
&mdash;that even holy &s;teps &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed
this way; and when &s;he con&s;idered al&s;o,
that he had expre&s;&s;ed no &s;urprize at a cir|cum&s;tance,
according to his own a&s;&s;ertion,
&s;o unu&s;ual. Again it appeared, that &s;he
had been betrayed into the very pri&s;on,
de&s;igned for her by the Abbe&s;s; and the
horror, occa&s;ioned by this &s;uppo&s;ition, was
&s;o great, that &s;he was on the point of dis|clo&s;ing
it to Vivaldi, but an apprehen&s;ion
of the di&s;traction, into which his de&s;perate
courage might precipitate him, re&s;trained
her.</P>
<P>While the&s;e con&s;iderations occupied El|lena,
and it appeared that any certainty
would be le&s;s painful than this &s;u&s;pen&s;e,
&s;he frequently looked round the chamber
in &s;earch of &s;ome object, which might con|tradict
or confirm her &s;u&s;picion, that this
was the death-room of the unfortunate
<PB N="33" REF="34">
nun. No &s;uch circum&s;tance appeared, but
as her eyes glanced, with almo&s;t phrenzied
eagerne&s;s? &s;he perceived &s;omething &s;ha|dowy
in a remote corner of the floor; and
on approaching, di&s;covered what &s;eemed a
dreadful hieroglyphic, a mattra&s;s of &s;traw,
in which &s;he thought &s;he beheld the
death-bed of the mi&s;erable reclu&s;e; nay
more, that the impre&s;&s;ion it &s;till retained,
was that which her form had left there.</P>
<P>While Vivaldi was yet entreating her
to explain the occa&s;ion of the horror
&s;he betrayed, the attention of each was
withdrawn by a hollow &s;igh, that ro&s;e
near them. Ellena caught uncon&s;ciou&s;ly
the arm of Vivaldi, and li&s;tened, agha&s;t,
for a return of the &s;ound, but all remained
&s;till.</P>
<P>"It &s;urely was not fancied!" &s;aid Vival|di,
after a long pau&s;e, "you heard it al&s;o?"</P>
<P>"I did!" replied Ellena.</P>
<P>"It was a &s;igh, was it not?" he added.</P>
<P>"O yes, and &s;uch a &s;igh!"</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
"Some per&s;on is concealed near us," ob|&s;erved
Vivaldi, looking round; "but be
not alarmed, Ellena, I have a &s;word."</P>
<P>"A &s;word! alas! you know not&mdash;But
hark! there, again!"</P>
<P>"That was very near us!" &s;aid Vivaldi.
"This lamp burns &s;o &s;ickly!"&mdash;and he
held it high, endeavouring to penetrate
the furthe&s;t gloom of the chamber. "Hah!
who goes there?" he cried, and &s;tepped
&s;uddenly forward; but no per&s;on appear|ed,
and a &s;ilence as of the tomb, returned.</P>
<P>"If you are in &s;orrow, &s;peak!" Vivaldi,
at length, &s;aid; "from fellow-&s;ufferers you
will meet with &s;ympathy. If your de&s;igns
are evil&mdash;tremble, for you &s;hall find I am
de&s;perate."</P>
<P>Still no an&s;wer was returned, and he car|ried
forward the lamp to the oppo&s;ite end
of the chamber, where he perceived a
&s;mall door in the rock. At the &s;ame in|&s;tant
he heard from within, a low tremu|lous
&s;ound, as of a per&s;on in prayer, or in
<PB N="35" REF="36">
agony. He pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t. the door,
which, to his &s;urprize, yielded immediate|ly,
and di&s;covered a figure kneeling before
a crucifix, with an attention &s;o wholly en|gaged,
as not to ob&s;erve the pre&s;ence of a
&s;tranger, till Vivaldi &s;poke. The per&s;on
then ro&s;e from his knees, and turning,
&s;hewed the &s;ilvered temples and pale fea|tures
of an aged monk. The mild and &s;or|rowful
character of the countenance, and
the lambent lu&s;tre of eyes, which &s;eemed
&s;till to retain &s;omewhat of the fire of ge|nius,
intere&s;ted Vivaldi, and encouraged
Ellena, who had followed him.</P>
<P>An unaffected &s;urprize appeared in the
air of the monk; but Vivaldi, notwith|&s;tanding
the intere&s;ting benignity of his
countenance, feared to an&s;wer his enqui|ries,
till the father hinted to him, that an
explanation was nece&s;&s;ary, even to his own
&s;afety. Encouraged by his manner, rather
than intimidated by this hint, and per|ceiving,
that his &s;ituation was de&s;perate,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
Vivaldi confided to the friar &s;ome partial
knowledge of his embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, the father li&s;tened with
deep attention, looked with compa&s;&s;ion al|ternately
upon him and Ellena; and &s;ome
hara&s;&s;ing objection &s;eemed to contend
with the pity, which urged him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
&s;trangers. He enquired how long Jeroni|mo
had been ab&s;ent, and &s;hook his head
&s;ignificantly when he learned that the gate
of the avenue was fa&s;tened by a double
lock. "You are betrayed, my children,"
&s;aid he, "you have tru&s;ted with the &s;im|plicity
of youth, and the cunning of age has deceived you."</P>
<P>The terrible conviction affected Ellena
to tears; and Vivaldi, &s;carcely able to com|mand
the indignation which a view of &s;uch
treachery excited, was unable to offer her
any con&s;olation.</P>
<P>"You, my daughter, I remember to
have &s;een in the church this morning,"
ob&s;erved the friar; "I remember too, that
<PB N="37" REF="38">
you prote&s;ted again&s;t the vows you were
brought thither to &s;eal. Alas! my child,
was you aware of the con&s;equence of &s;uch
a proceeding?"</P>
<P>"I had only a choice of evils," Ellena
replied.</P>
<P>"Holy father," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I will
not believe, that you are one of tho&s;e who
either a&s;&s;i&s;ted in or approved the per&s;ecu|tion
of innocence. If you were acquainted
with the misfortunes of this lady, you
would pity, and &s;ave her; but there is now
no time for detail; and I can only conjure
you, by every &s;acred con&s;ideration, to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her to leave the convent! If there were
lei&s;ure to inform you of the unju&s;tifiable
means, which have been employed to bring
her within the&s;e walls&mdash;if you knew that
&s;he was; taken, an orphan, from her home
at midnight&mdash;that armed ruffians brought
her hither&mdash;and at the command of &s;tran|gers
&mdash;that &s;he has not a &s;ingle relation &s;ur|viving
to a&s;&s;ert her right of independence,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
or reclaim her of her per&s;ecutors.&mdash;O!
holy father, if you knew all this!"&mdash;Vi|valdi
was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>The friar again regarded Ellena with
compa&s;&s;ion, but &s;till in thoughtful &s;ilence.
"All this may be very true," at length he
&s;aid, "but"&mdash;and he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you, father," &s;aid Vival|di
&mdash;"you require proof; but how can
proof be adduced here? You mu&s;t rely up|on
the honour of my word. And, if you are
inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, it mu&s;t be immediate|ly!&mdash;while
you he&s;itate, we are lo&s;t. Even
now I think I hear the foot&s;teps of Jeronimo."</P>
<P>He &s;tepped &s;oftly to the door of the
chamber, but all was yet &s;till. The friar,
too, li&s;tened, but he al&s;o deliberated;
while Ellena, with cla&s;ped hands and a look
of eager &s;upplication and terror, awaited his
deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>"No one is approaching," &s;aid Vivaldi,
"it is not yet too late!&mdash;Good father!
if you would &s;erve us, di&s;patch."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">
"Poor innocent!" &s;aid the friar, half to
him&s;elf, "in this chamber&mdash;in this fatal
place!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It In this chamber!" exclaimed Ellena,
anticipating his meaning. "It was in this
chamber, then, that a nun was &s;uffered to
peri&s;h! and I, no doubt, am conducted hi|ther
to undergo a &s;imilar fate!"</P>
<P>"In this chamber!" re-echoed Vivaldi,
in a voice of de&s;peration, "Holy father,
if you are indeed di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, let
us act this in&s;tant; the next, perhaps, may
render your be&s;t intentions unavailing!"</P>
<P>The friar, who had regarded Ellena
while &s;he mentioned the nun, with the ut|mo&s;t
&s;urprize, now withdrew his attention;
a few tears fell on his cheek, but he ha&s;tily
dried them, and &s;eemed &s;truggling to over|come
&s;ome grief, that was deep in his
heart.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, finding that entreaty had no
power to ha&s;ten his deci&s;ion, and expect|ing
every moment to hear the approach of
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Jeronimo, paced the chamber in agonizing
perturbation, now pau&s;ing at the door to
li&s;ten, and then calling, though almo&s;t
hopele&s;&s;ly, upon the humanity of the friar.
While Ellena, looking round the room in
&s;huddering horror, repeatedly exclaimed,
"On this very &s;pot! in this very chamber!
O what &s;ufferings have the&s;e walls witne&s;&s;|ed!
what are they yet to witne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi now endeavoured to &s;oothe the
&s;pirits of Ellena, and again urged the friar
to employ this critical moment in &s;aving
her; "O heaven!" &s;aid he, "if &s;he is now
di&s;covered, her fate is certain!"</P>
<P>"I dare not &s;ay what that fate would
be," interrupted the father, "or what my
own, &s;hould I con&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t you; but,
though I am old, I have not quite for|gotten
to feel for others! They may op|pre&s;s
the few remaining years of my age,
but the blooming days of youth &s;hould
flouri&s;h; and they &s;hall flouri&s;h, my chil|dren,
if my power can aid you. Follow
<PB N="41" REF="42">
me to the gate; we will &s;ee whether my
key cannot unfa&s;ten all the locks that hold
it."</P>
<P>Vivaldi and Ellena immediately fol|lowed
the feeble &s;teps of the old man, who
frequently &s;topped to li&s;ten whether Jero|nimo,
or any of the brothers, to whom the
latter might have betrayed Ellena's &s;itua|tion,
were approaching; but not an echo
wandered along the lonely avenue, till they
reached the gate, when di&s;tant foot&s;teps
beat upon the ground.</P>
<P>"They are approaching, father!" whi&s;|pered
Ellena. "O, if the key &s;hould not
open the&s;e locks in&s;tantly, we are lo&s;t!
Hark! now I hear their voices&mdash;they call
upon my name! Already they have di&s;co|vered
we have left the chamber."</P>
<P>While the friar, with trembling hands,
applied the key, Vivaldi endeavoured at
once to a&s;&s;ist him, and to encourage El|lena.</P>
<P>The locks gave way, and the gate opened
<PB N="42" REF="43">
at once upon the moonlight mountains.
Ellena heard once more, with the joy of li|berty,
the midnight breeze pa&s;&s;ing among
the pen&s;ile branches of the palms, that
loftily over&s;hadowed a rude platform be|fore
the gate, and ru&s;tling with fainter
&s;ound among the pendent &s;hrubs of the
&s;urrounding cliffs.</P>
<P>"There is no lei&s;ure for thanks, my
children," &s;aid the friar, ob&s;erving they
were about to &s;peak. "I will fallen the
gate, and endeavour to delay your pur|&s;uers,
that you may have time to e&s;cape.
My ble&s;&s;ing go with you!"</P>
<P>Ellena and Vivaldi had &s;carcely a mo|ment
to bid him "farewell!" before he
clo&s;ed the door, and Vivaldi, taking her
arm, was ha&s;tening towards the place
where he had ordered Paulo to wait with
the hor&s;es, when, on turning an angle of
the convent wall, they perceived a long
train of pilgrims i&s;&s;uing forth from the
portal, at a little di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
Vivaldi drew back; yet dreading every
moment, that he lingered near the mona&s;|tery,
to hear the voice of Jeronimo, or
other per&s;ons, from the avenue, he was
&s;ometimes inclined to proceed at any ha|zard.
The only practicable path leading
to the ba&s;e of the mountain, however, was
now occupied by the&s;e devotees, and to
mingle with them was little le&s;s than cer|tain
de&s;truction. A bright moonlight
&s;hewed di&s;tinctly every figure, that moved
in the &s;cene, and the fugitives kept within
the &s;hadow of the walls, till, warned by an
approaching foot&s;tep, they cro&s;&s;ed to the
feet of the cliffs that ro&s;e beyond &s;ome
palmy hillocks on the right, who&s;e du&s;ky
rece&s;&s;es promi&s;ed a temporary &s;helter.
As they pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ilent &s;teps along the
winding rocks, the tranquillity of the land|&s;cape
below afforded an affecting contra&s;t
with the tumult and alarm of their minds.</P>
<P>Being now at &s;ome di&s;tance from the
mona&s;tery, they re&s;ted under the &s;hade of
<PB N="44" REF="45">
the cliffs, till the proce&s;&s;ion of devotees,
which were traced de&s;cending among the
thickets and hollows of the mountain,
&s;hould be &s;ufficiently remote. Often they
looked back to the convent, expecting to
&s;ee lights i&s;&s;ue from the avenue, or the por|tal;
and attended in mute anxiety for the
&s;ullen murmurs of pur&s;uit; but none
came on the breeze; nor did any gleam|ing
lamp betray the &s;teps of a &s;py.</P>
<P>Relea&s;ed, at length, from immediate
apprehen&s;ion, Ellena li&s;tened to the mat|tin-hymn
of the pilgrims, as it came upon
the &s;till air and a&s;cended towards the
cloudle&s;s heavens. Not a &s;ound mingled
with the holy &s;train, and even in the mea|&s;ured
pau&s;e of voices only the trembling of
the foliage above was di&s;tingui&s;hed. The
re&s;pon&s;es, as they &s;oftened away in di&s;|tance,
and &s;welled again on the wafting
breeze, appeared like the mu&s;ic of &s;pirits,
watching by night upon the &s;ummits of
the mountains, and an&s;wering each other
<PB N="45" REF="46">
in cele&s;tial airs, as they walk their high
boundary, and overlook the &s;leeping
world.</P>
<P>"How often, Ellena, at this hour,"
&s;aid Vivaldi, "have I lingered round your
dwelling, con&s;oled by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
being near you! Within tho&s;e walls, I
have &s;aid, &s;he repo&s;es; they enclo&s;e my
worlds, all without is to me a de&s;art. Now,
I am in your pre&s;ence! O Ellena! now
that you are once more re&s;tored to me, &s;uf|fer
not the caprice of po&s;&s;ibility again to
&s;eparate us! Let me lead you to the fir&s;t
altar that will confirm our vows."</P>
<P>Vivaldi forgot, in the anxiety of a
&s;tronger intere&s;t, the delicate &s;ilence he
had re&s;olved to impo&s;e upon him&s;elf, till
Ellena &s;hould be in a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>"This is not a moment," &s;he replied,
with he&s;itation, "for conver&s;ation; our
&s;ituation is yet perilous, we tremble on the
very brink pf danger."</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
Vivaldi immediately ro&s;e; "Into what
imminent danger," &s;aid he, "had my &s;elf|i&s;h
folly nearly precipitated you! We are
lingering in this alarming neighbourhood,
when that feeble &s;train indicates the pil|grims
to be &s;ufficiently remote to permit
us to proceed!"</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, they de&s;cended cautiou&s;ly
among the cliffs, often looking back to
the convent, where, however, no light ap|peared,
except what the moon &s;hed over
the &s;pires and tall windows of its cathedral.
For a moment, Ellena fancied &s;he &s;aw a
taper in her favourite turret, and a belief,
that the nuns, perhaps the Abbe&s;s her&s;elf,
were &s;earching for her there, renewed her
terror and her &s;peed. But the rays were
only tho&s;e of the moon, &s;triking through
oppo&s;ite ca&s;ements of the chamber; and the
fugitives reached the ba&s;e of the mountain
without further alarm, where Paulo ap|peared
with hor&s;es, "Ah! Signormio," &s;aid
<PB N="47" REF="48">
the &s;ervant, "I am glad to &s;ee you alive
and merry; I began to fear, by the length
of your &s;tay, that, the monks had clapped
you up to do penance for life. How glad
I am to &s;ee you Ma&eacute;&s;tro!"</P>
<P>"Not more &s;o than I am to &s;ee you,
good Paulo. But where is the pilgrim's
cloak I bade you provide?"</P>
<P>Paulo di&s;played it, and Vivaldi, having
wrapt it round Ellena, and placed her on
hor&s;eback, they took the read towards
Naples, Ellena de&s;igning to take refuge in
the convent della Pieta. Vivaldi, how|ever,
apprehending that their enemies
would &s;eek them on this road, propo&s;ed
leaving it as &s;oon as practicable, and reach|ing
the neighbourhood of Villa Altieri by
a circuitous way.</P>
<P>They &s;oon after arrived at the tremen|dous
pa&s;s, through which Ellena had ap|proached
the mona&s;tery, and who&s;e hor|rors
were considerably heightened at this
du&s;ky hour, for the moonlight fell only
<PB N="48" REF="49">
partially upon the deep barriers of the
gorge, and frequently the precipice, with
the road on its brow, was entirely &s;hadow|ed
by other cliffs and woody points that
ro&s;e above it. But Paulo, who&s;e &s;pirits
&s;eldom owned the influence of local
&s;cenery, jogged merrily along, frequently
congratulating him&s;elf and his ma&s;ter on
their e&s;cape, and carolling bri&s;kly to the
echoes of the rocks, till Vivaldi, appre|hen&s;ive
for the consequence of this loud
gaiety, de&s;ired him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"Ah Signormio! I mu&s;t obey you," &s;aid
he, "but my heart was never &s;o full in my
life; and I would fain &s;ing, to unburden
it of &s;ome of this joy. That &s;crape we got
into in the dungeon there, at what's the
name of the place? was bad enough, but it
was nothing to this, becau&s;e here I was left
out of it; and you, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> might have
been murdered again and again, while I,
thinking of nothing at all, was quietly air|ing
my&s;elf on the mountain by moonlight.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">
But what is that yonder in the &s;ky, Sig|nor?
It looks for all the world like a
bridge; only it is perched &s;o high, that
nobody would think of building one in
&s;uch an out-of-the-way place, unle&s;s to cro&s;s
from cloud to cloud, much le&s;s would
take the trouble of clambering up after it,
for the plea&s;ure of going over.</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked forward, and Ellena per|ceived
the Alpine bridge, &s;he had former|ly
cro&s;&s;ed with &s;o much alarm, in the
moonlight per&s;pective, airily &s;u&s;pended
between tremendous cliffs, with the river
far below, tumbling down the rocky
cha&s;m. One of the &s;upporting cliffs, with
part of the bridge, was in deep &s;hade, but
the other, feathered with foliage, and the
ri&s;ing &s;urges at its foot, were &s;trongly illu|mined;
and many a thicket wet with the
&s;pray, &s;parkled in contra&s;t to the dark
rock it overhung. Beyond the arch, the
long-drawn pro&s;pect faded into mi&s;ty
light.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">
"Well, to be &s;ure!" exclaimed Paulo,
"to &s;ee what curio&s;ity will do! If there
are not &s;ome people have found their way
up to the bridge already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi now perceived figures upon the
&s;lender arch, and, as their indi&s;tinct forms
glided in the moon&s;hine, other emotions
than tho&s;e of wonder di&s;turbed him, le&s;t
the&s;e might be pilgrims going to the &s;hrine
of our Lady, and who would give infor|mation
of his route. No po&s;&s;ibility, how|ever,
appeared of avoiding them, for the
precipices that ro&s;e immediately above,
and fell below, forbade all excur&s;ion, and
the road it&s;elf was &s;o narrow, as &s;carcely to
admit of two hor&s;es pa&s;&s;ing each other.</P>
<P>"They are all off the bridge now, and
without having broken their necks, per|haps!"
&s;aid Paulo, "where, I wonder,
will they go next! Why &s;urely, Signor,
this road does not lead to the bridge
yonder; we are not going to pick our way
in the air too? The roar of tho&s;e waters
<PB N="51" REF="52">
has made my head dizzy already; and the
rocks here are as dark as midnight, and
&s;eem ready to tumble upon one; they are
enough to make one de&s;pair to look at
them; you need not have checked my
mirth, Signor."</P>
<P>"I would fain check your loquacity,"
replied Vivaldi. "Do, good Paulo, be
&s;ilent and circum&s;pect, tho&s;e people may
be near us, though we do not yet &s;ee
them."</P>
<P>"The road does lead to the bridge,
then Signor!" &s;aid Paulo dolourou&s;ly.
"And &s;ee! there they are again; winding
round that rock, and coming towards us."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! they are pilgrims," whi&s;pered
Vivaldi, "we will linger under the &s;hade
of the&s;e rocks, while they pa&s;s. Remem|ber,
Paulo, that a &s;ingle indi&s;creet word
may be fatal; and that if they hail us, I
alone am to an&s;wer."</P>
<P>"You are obeyed, Signor."</P>
<P>The fugitives drew up clo&s;e under the
cliffs, and proceeded &s;lowly, while the
<PB N="52" REF="53">
words of the devotees, as they advanced,
became audible.</P>
<P>"It gives one &s;ome comfort," &s;aid Paulo,
to hear cheerful voices, in &s;uch a place as
this. Ble&s;s their merry hearts! theirs
&s;eems a pilgrimage of plea&s;ure; but they
will be demure enough, I warrant, by
and bye. I wi&s;h I"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Paulo! have you &s;o &s;oon forgot?"
&s;aid Vivaldi &s;harply.</P>
<P>The devotees, on perceiving the tra|vellers,
became &s;uddenly &s;ilent; till he
who appeared to be the <HI>Father-director,</HI> as
they pa&s;&s;ed, &s;aid "Hail! in the name of
<HI>Our Lady of Mount Carmel!</HI>" and they
repeated the &s;alutation in chorus.</P>
<P>"Hail!" replied Vivaldi, "the fir&s;t
ma&s;s is over," and he pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P>"But if you make ha&s;te, you may come
in for the &s;econd," &s;aid Paulo, jogging
after.</P>
<P>"You have ju&s;t left the &s;hrine, then?"
&s;aid one of the party, "and can tell us"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">
"Poor pilgrims, like your&s;elves," replied
Paulo, "and can tell as little. Good mor|row,
fathers, yonder peeps the dawn!"</P>
<P>He came up with his ma&s;ter, who had
hurried forward with Ellena, and who now
&s;everely reproved his indi&s;cretion; while
the voices of the Carmelites, &s;inging the
mattin-hymn, &s;unk away among the rocks,
and the quietne&s;s of &s;olitude returned.</P>
<P>"Thank heaven! we are quit of this
adventure," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"And now we have only the bridge to
get over," rejoined Paulo, "and, I hope, we &s;hall all be &s;afe."</P>
<P>They were now at the entrance of it;
as they pa&s;&s;ed the trembling planks, and
looked up the glen, a party of people ap|peared
advancing on the road the fugitives
had left, and a chorus of other voices than
tho&s;e of the Carmelites, were heard ming|ling
with the hollow &s;ound of the waters.</P>
<P>Ellena, again alarmed, ha&s;tened for|ward,
and Vivaldi, though he endeavoured
<PB N="54" REF="55">
to appea&s;e her apprehen&s;ion of pur&s;uit, en|couraged
her &s;peed.</P>
<P>"The&s;e are nothing but more pilgrims
Signora," &s;aid Paulo, "or they would
not &s;end &s;uch loud &s;houts before them;
they mu&s;t needs think we can hear."</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded as fa&s;t as the
broken road would permit; and were &s;oon
beyond the reach of the voices; but as
Paulo turned to look whether the party
was within &s;ight, he perceived two per&s;ons,
wrapt in cloaks, advancing under the
brow of the cliffs, and within a few paces
of his hor&s;e's heels. Before he could give
notice to his ma&s;ter, they were at his &s;ide.</P>
<P>"Are you returning from the &s;hrine of
<HI>our Lady?</HI>" &s;aid one of them.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;tartled by the voice, looked
round, and demanded who a&s;ked the que&s;|tion?</P>
<P>"A brother pilgrim," replied the man,
"one who has toiled up the&s;e &s;teep rocks,
till his limbs will &s;carcely bear him fur|ther.
<PB N="55" REF="56">
Would that you would take com|pa&s;&s;ion
on him, and give him a ride."</P>
<P>However compa&s;&s;ionate Vivaldi might
be to the &s;ufferings of others, this was not
a moment when he could indulge his di&s;|po&s;ition,
without endangering the &s;afety
of Ellena; and he even fancied the &s;tran|ger
&s;poke in a voice of di&s;&s;imulation. His
&s;u&s;picions &s;trengthened when the traveller,
not repul&s;ed by a refu&s;al, enquired the way
he was going, and propo&s;ed to join his
party; "For the&s;e mountains, they &s;ay,
are infe&s;ted with banditti," he added,
"and a large company is le&s;s likely to be
attacked than a &s;mall one."</P>
<P>"If you are &s;o very weary, my friend,"
&s;aid Vivaldi, "how is it po&s;&s;ible you can
keep pace with our hor&s;es?" though I ac|knowledge
you have done wonders in over|taking
them."</P>
<P>"The fear of the&s;e banditti," replied
the &s;tranger, "urged us on."</P>
<P>"You have nothing to apprehend from
<PB N="56" REF="57">
robbers," &s;aid Vivaldi, "if you will only
moderate your pace; for a large company
of pilgrims are on the road, who will &s;oon
overtake you."</P>
<P>He then put an end to the conver&s;ation,
by clapping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and the
&s;trangers were &s;oon left far behind. The
incon&s;i&s;tency of their complaints with their
ability, and the whole of their manner,
were &s;erious &s;ubjects of alarm to the fu|gitives;
but when they had lo&s;t &s;ight of
them, they lo&s;t al&s;o their apprehen&s;ions;
and having, at length, emerged from the
pa&s;s, they quitted the high road to Naples,
and &s;truck into a &s;olitary one that led
we&s;tward towards Aquila.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM the &s;ummit of a mountain, the
morning light &s;hewed the travellers the
di&s;tant lake of Celano, gleaming at the
feet of other lofty mountains of the Appen|nine,
far in the &s;outh. Thither Vivaldi
judged it prudent to direct his cour&s;e, for
the lake lay &s;o remote from the immediate
way to Naples, and from the neighbour|hood
of San Stefano, that it's, banks pro|mi&s;ed
a &s;ecure retreat. He con&s;idered,
al&s;o, that among the convents &s;cattered
along tho&s;e delightful banks, might ea&s;ily
be found a prie&s;t, who would &s;olemnize
their nuptials, &s;hould Ellena con&s;ent to
an immediate marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
The travellers de&s;cended among olive
woods, and &s;oon after were directed by
&s;ome pea&s;ants at work, into a road that
leads from Aquila to the town of Celano,
one of the very few roads which intrudes
among the wild mountains, that on every
&s;ide &s;eque&s;ter the lake. As they approach|ed
the low grounds, the &s;cent of orange
blo&s;&s;oms breathed upon the morning air,
and the &s;picy myrtle &s;ent forth all its fra|grance
from among the cliffs, which it
thickly tufted. Bowers of lemon and
orange &s;pread along the valley; and among
the cabins of the pea&s;ants, who cultivated
them, Vivaldi hoped to obtain repo&s;e and
refre&s;hment for Ellena.</P>
<P>The cottages, however, at which Paulo
enquired were unoccupied, the owners be|ing
all gone forth to their labour: and
the travellers, again a&s;cending, found them|&s;elves
&s;oon after among mountains inha|bited
by the flocks, where the &s;cent of the
<PB N="59" REF="60">
orange was exchanged for the aromatic
perfume of the pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>"My Signor!" &s;aid Paulo, "is not that
a &s;hepherd's horn &s;ounding at a di&s;tance?
If &s;o, the Signora may yet obtain &s;ome
refre&s;hment."</P>
<P>While Vivaldi li&s;tened, a hautboy and a
pa&s;toral drum were heard considerably
nearer.</P>
<P>They followed the &s;ound over the turf,
and came within view of a cabin, &s;heltered
from the &s;un by a tuft of almond trees.
It was a dairy-cabin belonging to &s;ome
&s;hepherds, who at a &s;hort di&s;tance were
watching their flocks, and, &s;tretched be|neath
the &s;hade of che&s;tnuts, were amu&s;|ing
them&s;elves by playing upon the&s;e rural
in&s;truments; a &s;cene of Arcadian manners
frequent at this day, upon the mountains
of Abruzzo. The &s;implicity of their ap|pearance,
approaching to wildne&s;s, was
tempered by a ho&s;pitable &s;pirit. A vene|rable
man, the chief &s;hepherd, advanced
<PB N="60" REF="61">
to meet the &s;trangers; and, learning their
wants, conducted them into his cool cabin,
where cream, chee&s;e made of goat's milk,
honey extracted from the delicious herbage
of the mountains, and dried figs were
quickly placed before them.</P>
<P>Ellena, overcome with the fatigue of
anxiety, rather than that of travelling, re|tired,
when &s;he had taken breakfa&s;t, for an
hour's repo&s;e; while Vivaldi re&s;ted on the
bench before the cottage, and Paulo, keep|ing
watch, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed his breakfa&s;t, toge|ther
with the circum&s;tances of the late
alarm, under the &s;hade of the almond trees.</P>
<P>When Ellena again appeared, Vivaldi
propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould re&s;t here dur|ing
the inten&s;e heat of the day; and, &s;ince
he now con&s;idered her to be in a place of
temporary &s;afety, he ventured to renew the
&s;ubject neare&s;t his heart; to repre&s;ent the
evils, that might overtake them, and to
urge an immediate &s;olemnization of their
marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">
Thoughtful and dejected, Ellena at|tended
for &s;ome time in &s;ilence to the ar|guments
and pleadings of Vivaldi. She &s;ecretly acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of his
repre&s;entations, but &s;he &s;hrunk, more than
ever; from the indelicacy, the degradation
of intruding her&s;elf into his family; a fa|mily,
too, from whom &s;he had not only
received proofs of &s;trong di&s;like, but had
&s;uffered terrible inju&s;tice, and been me|naced
with &s;till &s;everer cruelty. The&s;e
latter circum&s;tances, however, relea&s;ed her
from all obligations of delicacy or genero|&s;ity,
&s;o far as concerned only the authors
of her &s;uffering; and &s;he had now but to
con&s;ider the happine&s;s of Vivaldi and her|&s;elf.
Yet &s;he could not decide thus pre|cipitately
on a &s;ubject, which &s;o &s;olemnly
involved the fortune of her whole life; nor
forbear reminding Vivaldi, affectionately,
gratefully, as &s;he loved him, of the cir|cum&s;tances
which with-held her deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Tell me your&s;elf," &s;aid &s;he, "whether
<PB N="62" REF="63">
I ought to give my hand, while your fa|mily
&mdash;your mother"&mdash;She pau&s;ed, and
blu&s;hed, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"Spare me the view of tho&s;e tears,"
&s;aid Vivaldi, "and a recollection of the
circum&s;tances that excite them. O, let
me not think of my mother, while I &s;ee
you weep! Let me not remember, that
her inju&s;tice and cruelty de&s;tined you to
perpetual &s;orrow!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi's features became &s;lightly con|vul&s;ed,
while he &s;poke; he ro&s;e, paced the
room with quick &s;teps, and then quitted
it, and walked under the &s;hade of the
trees in front of the cabin.</P>
<P>In a few moments, however, he com|manded
his emotion and returned. Again
he placed him&s;elf on the bench be&s;ide
Ellena, and taking her hand, &s;aid &s;olemn|ly,
and in a voice of extreme &s;en&s;ibility,
"Ellena, you have long witne&s;&s;ed how
dear you are to me; you cannot doubt
my love; you have long &s;ince promi&s;ed&mdash;
<PB N="63" REF="64">
&s;olemnly promi&s;ed, in the pre&s;ence of her
who is now no more, but who&s;e &s;pirit may
even at this moment look down upon us,
&mdash;of her, who bequeathed you to my ten|dere&s;t
care, to be mine for ever. By the&s;e
&s;acred truths, by the&s;e affecting recollec|tions!
I conjure you, abandon me not to
de&s;pair, nor in the energy of a ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment,
&s;acrifice the &s;on to the cruel and
mi&s;taken policy of the mother! You, nor
I, can conjecture the machinations, which
may be &s;pread for us, when it &s;hall be
known that you have left San Stefano.
If we delay to exchange our vows, I know,
and I feel&mdash;that you are lo&s;t to me for
ever!"</P>
<P>Ellena was affected, and for &s;ome mo|ments
unable to reply. At length, dry|ing
her tears, &s;he &s;aid tenderly, "Re&s;ent|ment
can have no influence on my con|duct
towards you; I think I feel none
towards the Marche&s;a&mdash;for &s;he is your
mother. But pride, in&s;ulted pride, has a
<PB N="64" REF="65">
right to dictate, and ought to be obeyed;
and the time is now, perhaps, arrived when,
if I would re&s;pect my&s;elf, I mu&s;t renounce
you."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Renounce me!" interrupted Vivaldi,
"renounce me! And is it, then, po&s;&s;ible
you could renounce me?" he repeated,
his eyes &s;till fixed upon her face with ea|gerne&s;s
and con&s;ternation. "Tell me at
once, Ellena, is it po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"I fear it is not," &s;he replied.</P>
<P>"You fear! alas! if you <HI>fear,</HI> it is too
po&s;&s;ible, and I have lo&s;t you already! Say,
O! &s;ay but, that you <HI>hope</HI> it is not, and I,
too, will hope again."</P>
<P>The angui&s;h, with which he uttered this,
awakened all her tenderne&s;s, and, forget|ting
the re&s;erve &s;he had impo&s;ed upon her|&s;elf,
and every half-formed re&s;olution; &s;he
&s;aid, with a &s;mile of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s, "I
will neither fear nor hope in this in&s;tance;
I will obey the dictates of gratitude, of
affection, and will <HI>believe.</HI> that I never
<PB N="65" REF="66">
can renounce you, while you are un|changed."</P>
<P>"Believe!" repeated Vivaldi, "only
believe! And why that mention of grati|tude;
and why that unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;erva|tion?
Yet even this a&s;&s;urance, feebly as it
&s;u&s;tains my hopes, is extorted; you &s;ee
my mi&s;ery, and from pity, from <HI>gratitude,</HI>
not affection, would a&s;&s;uage it. Be&s;ides,
you will neither fear, nor hope! Ah, Elle|na!
did love ever yet exi&s;t without fear&mdash;and
without hope? O! never, never! I
fear and hope with &s;uch rapid tran&s;ition;
every a&s;&s;urance, every look of yours gives
&s;uch force either to the one, or to the
other, that I &s;uffer uncea&s;ing anxiety.
Why, too, that cold, that heart-breaking
mention of gratitude? No, Ellena! it is
too certain that you do not love me!&mdash;My
mother's cruelty has e&s;tranged your heart
from me!"</P>
<P>"How much you mi&s;take!" &s;aid Elle|na.
"You have already received &s;acred
<PB N="66" REF="67">
te&s;timonies of my regard; if you doubt
their &s;incerity, pardon me, if I &s;o far re|pect
my&s;elf as to forbear entreating you
will believe them."</P>
<P>"How calm, how indifferent, how cir|cum&s;pect,
how prudent!" exclaimed Vi|valdi
in tones of mournful reproach.
"But I will not di&s;tre&s;s you; forgive me
for renewing this &s;ubject at this time. It
was my intention to be &s;ilent till you &s;hould
have reached a place of more permanent
&s;ecurity than this; but how was it po&s;&s;ible,
with &s;uch anxiety pre&s;&s;ing upon my heart,
to per&s;evere in that de&s;ign. And what have
I gained by departing from it?&mdash;increa&s;e
of anxiety&mdash;of doubt&mdash;of fear!"</P>
<P>"Why will you per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch &s;elf-in|flictions?"
&s;aid Ellena. "I cannot endure
that you &s;hould doubt my affection, even
for a moment. And how can you &s;uppo&s;e
it po&s;&s;ible, that I ever can become in&s;en|&s;ible
of your's; that I can ever forget the
imminent danger you have voluntarily in|curred
<PB N="67" REF="68">
for my relea&s;e, or, remembering it,
can cea&s;e to feel the warme&s;t gratitude?"</P>
<P>"That is the very word which tortures
me beyond all others!" &s;aid Vivaldi; "is
it then, only a &s;en&s;e of obligation you own
for me? O! rather &s;ay you hate me, than
&s;uffer me to deceive my hopes with a&s;&s;ur|ances
of a &s;entiment &s;o cold, &s;o circum|&s;cribed,
&s;o dutiful as that of gratitude!"</P>
<P>"With me the word has a very diffe|rent
acceptation," replied Ellena &s;miling.
"I under&s;tand it to imply all that is tender
and generous in affection; and the &s;en&s;e
of duty which you &s;ay it includes, is one of
the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred feelings of the
human heart."</P>
<P>"Ah Ellena! I am too willing to be de|ceived,
to examine your definition rigo|rou&s;ly;
yet I believe it is your &s;mile, ra|ther
than the accuracy of your explana|tion,
that per&s;uades me to a confidence in
your affection; and I will tru&s;t, that the
gratitude <HI>you</HI> feel is thus tender and com|prehen&s;ive.
<PB N="68" REF="69">
But, I be&s;eech you, name
the word no more! Its &s;ound is like the
touch of the Torpedo, I perceive my con|fidence
chilled even while I li&s;ten to my
own pronunciation of it."</P>
<P>The entrance of Paulo interrupted the
conver&s;ation, who advancing with an
air of my&s;tery and alarm, &s;aid in a low
voice,</P>
<P>"Signor! as I kept watch under the
almond trees, who &s;hould I &s;ee mounting
up the road from the valley yonder, but
the two bare-footed Carmelites, that over took
us in the pa&s;s of Chiari! I lo&s;t them
again behind the woods, but I dare &s;ay
they are coming this way, for the moment
they &s;py out this dairy-hut, they will gue&s;s
&s;omething good is to be had here; and the
&s;hepherds would believe their flocks would
all die, if"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I &s;ee them at this moment emerging
from the woods," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and now,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
they are leaving the road and cro&s;&s;ing this
way. Where is our ho&s;t, Paulo!</P>
<P>"He is without, at a little di&s;tance,
Signor. Shall I call him?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Vivaldi, "or, &s;tay; I
will call him my&s;elf. Yet, if they &s;ee
me"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Aye, Signor; or, for that matter, if
they &s;ee me. But we cannot help our|&s;elves
now; for if we call the ho&s;t, we
&s;hall betray our&s;elves, and, if we do not
call him, he will betray us; &s;o they mu&s;t
find us out, be it as it may."</P>
<P>"Peace! peace! let me think a mo|ment,"
&s;aid Vivaldi. While Vivaldi un|dertook
to think, Paulo was peeping
about for a hiding place, if occa&s;ion &s;hould
require one.</P>
<P>"Call our ho&s;t immediately," &s;aid
Vivaldi, "I mu&s;t &s;peak with him."</P>
<P>"He pa&s;&s;es the lattice at this in&s;tant,"
&s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
Paulo obeyed, and the &s;hepherd en|tered
the cabin.</P>
<P>"My good friend," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I
mu&s;t entreat that you will not admit tho&s;e
friars, whom you &s;ee coming this way, nor
&s;uffer them to know what gue&s;ts you have.
They have been very trouble&s;ome to us al|ready,
on the road; I will reward you for
any lo&s;s their &s;udden departure may occa|&s;ion
you."</P>
<P>"Nay for that matter, friend," &s;aid
Paulo, "it is their vi&s;it only that can occa|&s;ion
you lo&s;s, begging the Signor's par|don;
their departure never occa&s;ioned
lo&s;s to any body. And to tell you the
truth, for my ma&s;ter will not &s;peak out,
we were obliged to look pretty &s;harply
about us, while they bore us company, or
we have rea&s;on to think our pockets would
have been the lighter. They are de&s;ign|ing
people, friend, take my word for it;
banditti, perhaps, in di&s;gui&s;e. The dre&s;s
<PB N="71" REF="72">
of a Carmelite would &s;uit their purpo&s;e, at
this time of the pilgrimage. So be pretty
blunt with them, if they want to come in
here; and you will do well, when they go,
to &s;end &s;omebody to watch which way
they take, and &s;ee them clear off, or you
may lo&s;e a &s;tray lamb, perhaps."</P>
<P>The old &s;hepherd lifted up his eyes and
hands, "To &s;ee how the world goes!" &s;aid
he. "But thank you, Mae&s;tro, for your
warning; they &s;hall not come within my
thre&s;hold, for all their holy &s;eeming, and
its the fir&s;t time in my life I ever &s;aid nay
to one of their garb, and mine has been a
pretty long one, as you may gue&s;s, per|haps,
by my face. How old, Signor,
&s;hould you take me to be? I warrant you
will gue&s;s &s;hort of the matter tho'; for on
the&s;e high mountains"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I will gue&s;s when you have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
the travellers," &s;aid Vivaldi, "after having
given them &s;ome ha&s;ty refre&s;hment with|out;
<PB N="72" REF="73">
they mu&s;t be almo&s;t at the door, by
this time. Di&s;patch, friend."</P>
<P>"If they &s;hould fall foul upon me, for
refu&s;ing them entrance," &s;aid the &s;hepherd,
"you will come out to help me, Signor?
for my lads are at &s;ome di&s;tance."</P>
<P>Vivaldi a&s;&s;ured him that they would,
and he left the cabin.</P>
<P>Paulo ventured to peep at the lattice, on
what might be going forward without.
"They are gone round to the door, Sig|nor,
I fancy," &s;aid he, "for I &s;ee nothing
of them this way; if there was but another
window What fooli&s;h people to build a
cottage with no window. near the door!
But I mu&s;t li&s;ten."</P>
<P>He &s;tepped on tip-toe to the door, and
bent his head in attention.</P>
<P>"They are certainly &s;pies from the mo|na&s;tery,"
&s;aid Ellena to Vivaldi, "they fo|llow
us &s;o clo&s;ely! If they were pilgrims, it
is improbable, too, that their way &s;hould
<PB N="73" REF="74">
be through this unfrequented region, and
&s;till more &s;o, that they &s;hould not travel in
a larger party. When my ab&s;ence was
di&s;covered, the&s;e people were &s;ent, no
doubt, in pur&s;uit of me, and having met
the devotees whom we pa&s;&s;ed, they were
enabled to follow our route."</P>
<P>"We &s;hall do well to act upon this &s;up|po&s;ition,"
replied Vivaldi, "but, though
I am inclined to believe them emi&s;&s;aries
from San Stefano, it is not improbable
that they are only Carmelites returning to
&s;ome convent on the lake of Celano."</P>
<P>"I cannot hear a &s;yllable, Signor," &s;aid
Paulo. "Pray do li&s;ten your&s;elf! and
there is not a &s;ingle chink in this door to
afford one con&s;olation. Well! if ever I
build a cottage, there &s;hall be a window
near&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Li&s;ten!" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Not a &s;ingle word, Signor!" cried
Paulo, after a pau&s;e, "I do not even hear
a voice!&mdash;But now I hear &s;teps, and they
<PB N="74" REF="75">
are coming to the door, too; they &s;hall
find it no ea&s;y matter to open it, though;"
he added, placing him&s;elf again&s;t it. "Ay,
ay, you may knock, friend, till your
arm aches, and kick and lay about you&mdash;no
matter for that."</P>
<P>"Silence! let us know who it is," &s;aid
Vivaldi; and the old &s;hepherd's voice
was heard without. "They are gone,
Signors," &s;aid he, "you may open the
door."</P>
<P>"Which way did they go?" a&s;ked Vi|valdi,
when the man entered. "I cannot
&s;ay, as to that, Signor, becau&s;e I did not
happen to &s;ee them at all; and I have been
looking all about, too."</P>
<P>"Why, I &s;aw them my&s;elf, cro&s;&s;ing
this way from the wood yonder," &s;aid
Paulo.</P>
<P>"And there is nothing to &s;helter them
from our view between the wood, and this
cottage, friend," added Vivaldi; "What
can they have done with them&s;elves?"</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">
"For that matter, gone into the wood
again, perhaps," &s;aid the &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>Paulo gave his ma&s;ter a &s;ignificant look,
and added, "It is likely enough, friend;
and you may depend upon it they are
lurking there for no good purpo&s;e, You
will do well to &s;end &s;omebody to look after
them; your flocks will &s;uffer for it, el&s;e.
Depend upon it, they de&s;ign no good."</P>
<P>"We are not u&s;ed to &s;uch &s;ort of folks
in the&s;e parts," replied the &s;hepherd,
"but if they mean any harm, they &s;hall
find we can help our&s;elves." As her con|cluded,
he took down a horn from the
roof, and blew a &s;hrill bla&s;t that made the
mountains echo; when immediately the
younger &s;hepherds were &s;een running from
various quarters towards the cottage.</P>
<P>"Do not be alarmed, friend;" &s;aid
Vivaldi, "the&s;e travellers mean you no
harm, I dare &s;ay, whatever they may de|&s;ign
again&s;t us. But, as I think them &s;u&s;|picious
per&s;ons, and &s;hould not like to
<PB N="76" REF="77">
overtake them on the road, I will reward
one of your lads if you will let him go a
little ways towards Celano, and examine
whether they are lurking on that route."</P>
<P>The old man con&s;ented, and, when the
&s;hepherds came up, one of them received
directions from Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"And be &s;ure you do not return, till
you have found them," added Paulo.</P>
<P>"No ma&s;ter," replied the lad, "and I
will bring them &s;afe here, you may tru&s;t
me."</P>
<P>"If you do, friend, you will get your
head broke for your trouble. You are
only to di&s;cover where they are, and to
watch where they go," &s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, at length, made the lad com|prehend
what was required of him, and
he departed; while the old &s;hepherd went
out to keep guard.</P>
<P>The time of his ab&s;ence was pa&s;&s;ed
in various conjectures by the party in the
cabin, concerning the Carmelites, Vivaldi
<PB N="77" REF="78">
&s;till inclined to believe they were hone&s;t
people returning from a pilgrimage, but
Paulo was decidedly again&s;t this opinion.
"They are waiting for us on the road, you
may depend upon it, Signor," &s;aid the
latter. "You may be certain they have
&s;ome <HI>great de&s;ign</HI> in hand, or they would
never have turned their &s;teps from this
dairy-hou&s;e when once they had &s;pied it,
and that they did &s;py it, we are &s;ure."</P>
<P>"But if they have in hand the great de|&s;ign
you &s;peak of, Paulo," &s;aid Vivaldi,
"it is probable that they have &s;pied us
al&s;o, by their taking this ob&s;cure road.
Now it mu&s;t have occurred to them when
they &s;aw a dairy-hut, in &s;o &s;olitary a region,
that we might probably be found within&mdash;yet
they have not examined. It appears,
therefore, they have no de&s;ign again&s;t
us. What can you an&s;wer to this Paulo?
I tru&s;t the apprehen&s;ions of Signora di
Ro&s;alba are un&s;ounded.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">
"Why! do you &s;uppo&s;e, Signor, they
would attack us when we were &s;afe
hou&s;ed, and had the&s;e good &s;hepherds to
lend us a helping hand? No, Signor, they
would not even have shewn them&s;elves, if
they could have helped it; and being once
&s;ure we were here, they would &s;kulk back
to the woods, and lurk for us in the road
they knew we mu&s;t go, &s;ince, as it hap|pens,
there is only one."</P>
<P>"How is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Ellena, "that
they can have di&s;covered us here, &s;ince they
did not approach the cabin to enquire."</P>
<P>"They came near enough for their pur|po&s;e,
Signora, I dare &s;ay; and, if the
truth were known, they &s;pied my face
looking at them through the lattice."</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid Vivaldi, "you
are an ingenious tormentor, indeed, Paulo.
Do you &s;uppo&s;e they &s;aw enough of thy
face la&s;t night by moonlight, in that du&s;ky
glen, to enable them to recollect it again
<PB N="79" REF="80">
at a di&s;tance of forty yards? Revive, my
Ellena, I think every appearance is in our
favour."</P>
<P>"Would I could think, &s;o too!" &s;aid
&s;he, with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"O! for that matter, Signora," rejoined
"Paulo, there is nothing to be afraid of;
they &s;hould find tough work of it, if
they thought proper to attack us, lady."</P>
<P>"It is not an open attack that we have
to fear," replied Ellena, "but they may
&s;urround us with their &s;nares, and defy re|&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>However Vivaldi might accede to the
truth of this remark, he would not appear
to do &s;o; but tried to laugh away her ap|prehen&s;ions;
and Paulo was &s;ilenced for a
while, by a &s;ignificant look from his
ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd's boy returned much
&s;ooner than they had expected, and he
probably &s;aved his time, that he might
&s;pare his labour, for he brought no intelli|gence
<PB N="80" REF="81">
of the Carmelites. "I looked for
them among the woods along the road
&s;ide in the hollow, yonder, too," &s;aid
the lad, "and then I mounted the hill
further on, but I could &s;ee nothing of
them far or near, nor of a &s;ingle &s;oul, ex|cept
our goats, and &s;ome of them do &s;tray
wide enough, &s;ometimes; they lead me a
fine dance often. They &s;ometimes, Sig|nor,
have wandered as far as Monte
Nuvola, yonder, and got to the top of it,
up among the clouds, and the crags,
where I &s;hould break my neck if I climbed;
and the rogues &s;eemed to know it, too,
for when they have &s;een me coming,
&s;crambling up, puffing and blowing, they
have cea&s;ed their capering, and &s;tood peep|ing
over a crag &s;o &s;ly, and &s;o quiet, it
&s;eemed as if they were laughing at me;
as much as to &s;ay, "Catch us if you
can."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who during the latter part of
this &s;peech had been con&s;ulting with
<PB N="81" REF="82">
Ellena, whether they &s;hould proceed on
their way immediately, a&s;ked the boy &s;ome
further que&s;tions concerning the Carme|lites;
and becoming convinced that they
had either not taken the road to Celano,
or, having taken it, were at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, he propo&s;ed &s;etting out, and pro|ceeding
lei&s;urely, "For I have now little
apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e people," he added,
"and a great deal le&s;t night &s;hould over take
us before we reach the place of our
de&s;tination, &s;ince the road is mountainous
and wild, and, further, we are not perfectly
acquainted with it."</P>
<P>Ellena approving the plan, they took
leave of the good &s;hepherd, who could
with difficulty be prevailed with to accept
any recompence for his trouble, and who
gave them &s;ome further directions as to the
road; and their way was long cheered by
the &s;ound of the tabor and the &s;weetne&s;s
of the hautboy, wafted over the wild.</P>
<P>When they de&s;cended into the woody
<PB N="82" REF="83">
hollow mentioned by the boy, Ellena &s;ent
forth many an anxious look beneath the
deep &s;hade; while Paulo, &s;ometimes &s;ilent,
and at others whi&s;tling and &s;inging loudly,
as if to overcome his fears, peeped under
every bough that cro&s;&s;ed the road, ex|pecting
to di&s;cover his friends the Carme|lites
lurking within its gloom.</P>
<P>Having emerged from this valley, the
road lay over mountains covered with
flocks, for it was now the &s;ea&s;on when they
had quitted the plains of Apulia, to feed
upon the herbage for which this region is
celebrated; and it was near &s;un-&s;et, when,
from a &s;ummit to which the travellers had
long been a&s;cending, the whole lake of
Celano, with its va&s;t circle of mountains,
bur&s;t at once upon their view.</P>
<P>"Ah Signor!" exclaimed Paulo, "what
a pro&s;pect is here! It reminds me of
home; it is almo&s;t as plea&s;ant as the bay
of Naples! I &s;hould never love it like that
though, if it were an hundred times finer."
<PB N="83" REF="84">
The travellers &s;topped to admire the
&s;cene, and to give their hor&s;es re&s;t, after
the labour of the a&s;cent. The evening
&s;un, &s;hooting athwart a clear expan&s;e of
water, between eighteen and twenty leagues
in circumference, lighted up all the towns
and villages, and towered ca&s;tles, and &s;piry
convents, that enriched the ri&s;ing &s;hores;
brought out all the various tints of culti|vation,
and coloured with beamy purple
the mountains which on every &s;ide formed
the maje&s;tic background of the land&s;cape.
Vivaldi pointed out to Ellena the gigan|tic
Velino in the north, a barrier moun|tain,
between the territories of Rome and
Naples. Its peaked head towered far
above every neighbouring &s;ummit, and its
white precipices were oppo&s;ed to the ver|dant
points of the Majella, &s;now-crowned,
and next in altitude, loved by the flocks.
We&s;tward, near woody hills, and ri&s;ing im|mediately
from the lake, appeared Monte
Salviano, covered with wild &s;age, as its
name imports, and once pompous with
<PB N="84" REF="85">
fore&s;ts of che&s;tnut; a branch from the Ap|pennine
extended to meet it. "See," &s;aid
Vivaldi "where Monte Corno &s;tands like
a ruffian, huge, &s;cared, threatening, and
horrid!&mdash;and in the &s;outh, where the &s;ullen
mountain of San Nicolo &s;hoots up, barren
and rocky! From thence, mark how other
overtopping ridges of the mighty Apennine
darken the horizon far along the ea&s;t, and
circle to approach the Velino in the north!"</P>
<P>"Mark too," &s;aid Ellena, "how &s;weet|ly
the banks and undulating plains repo&s;e
at the feet of the mountains; what an
image of beauty and elegance they oppo&s;e
to the awful grandeur that overlooks and
guards them! Ob&s;erve, too, how many a
delightful valley, opening from the lake,
&s;preads its rice and corn fields, &s;haded
with groves of the almond, far among the
winding hills; how gaily vineyards and
olives alternately chequer the acclivities,
and how gracefully the lofty palms bend
over the higher cliffs."</P>
<P>"Ay, Signora!" exclaimed Paulo, "and
<PB N="85" REF="86">
have the goodne&s;s to ob&s;erve how like are
the fi&s;hing boats, that &s;ail towards the ham|let
below, to tho&s;e one &s;ees upon the bay
of Naples. They are worth all the re&s;t of
the pro&s;pect, except indeed this fine &s;heet
of water, which is almo&s;t as good as the bay,
and that mountain, with its &s;harp
head, which is almo&s;t as good as Ve&s;uvius
&mdash;if it would but throw out fire!"</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t de&s;pair of finding a moun|tain
in this neighbourhood, &s;o <HI>good</HI> as to
do that, Paulo," &s;aid Vivaldi, &s;miling at
this &s;troke of nationality; "though, per|haps,
many that we now &s;ee, have once
been volcanic."</P>
<P>"I honour them for that, Signor; and
look at them with double &s;atisfaction;
but <HI>our.</HI> mountain is the only mountain in
the world. O! to &s;ee it of a dark night!
what a blazing it makes! and what a
height it will &s;hoot to! and what a light
it throws over the &s;ea! No other moun|tain
can do &s;o. It &s;eems as if the waves
<PB N="86" REF="87">
were all on fire. I have &s;een the reflec|tion
as far off as Capri, trembling all acro&s;s
the gulf, and &s;hewing every ve&s;&s;el as plain
as at noon day; ay, and every &s;ailor on
the deck. You never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;ight,
Signor."</P>
<P>"Why you do, indeed, &s;eem to have
forgotten that I ever did, Paulo, and
al&s;o that a volcano can do any mi&s;chief.
But let us return, Ellena, to the &s;cene be|fore
us. Yonder, a mile or two within
the &s;hore, is the town of Celano, whither
we are going."</P>
<P>The clearne&s;s of an Italian atmo&s;phere
permitted him to di&s;criminate the minute
through very di&s;tant features of the land|&s;cape;
and on an eminence ri&s;ing from the
plains of a valley, opening to the we&s;t, he
pointed out the modern Alba, crowned
with the ruins of its ancient ca&s;tle, &s;till
vi&s;ible upon the &s;plendor of the horizon,
the pri&s;on and tomb of many a Prince,
who, "fallen from his high e&s;tate," was
<PB N="87" REF="88">
&s;ent from Imperial Rome to fini&s;h here
the &s;ad rever&s;e of his days; to gaze from
the bars of his tower upon &s;olitudes where
beauty or grandeur admini&s;tered no a&s;|&s;uaging
feelings to him, who&s;e life had
pa&s;&s;ed amid&s;t the intrigues of the world,
and the feveri&s;h contentions of di&s;appoint|ed
ambition; to him, with whom reflec|tion
brought only remor&s;e, and antici|pation
de&s;pair; whom "no horizontal
beam enlivened in the crim&s;on evening of
life's du&s;ty day."</P>
<P>"And to &s;uch a &s;cene as this," &s;aid Vi|valdi,
"a Roman Emperor came, only for
the purpo&s;e of witne&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t barba|rous
exhibition; to indulge the mo&s;t &s;a|vage
delights! Here, Claudius celebrated
the accompli&s;hment of his arduous work,
an aqueduct to carry the overflowing wa|ters
of the Celano to Rome, by a naval
fight, in which hundreds of wretched &s;laves
peri&s;hed for his amu&s;ement! Its pure and
poli&s;hed &s;urface was &s;tained with human
<PB N="88" REF="89">
blood, and roughened by the plunging bo|dies
of the &s;lain, while the gilded gallies
of the Emperor floated gaily around, and
the&s;e beautiful &s;hores were made to echo
with applauding yells, worthy of the
furies!"</P>
<P>"We &s;carcely dare to tru&s;t the truth of
hi&s;tory, in &s;ome of its traits of human na|ture,"
&s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Signor," cried Paulo, "I have been
thinking that while we are taking the air,
&s;o much at our ea&s;e, here, tho&s;e Carmelites
may be &s;pying at us from &s;ome hole or
corner that we know nothing of, and may
&s;woop upon us, all of a &s;udden, before we
can help our&s;elves. Had we not better go
on, Signor?"</P>
<P>"Our hor&s;es are, perhaps, &s;ufficiently
re&s;ted," replied Vivaldi, "but, if I had not
long &s;ince di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all &s;u&s;picion of the
evil intention of tho&s;e &s;trangers, I &s;hould
not willingly have &s;topped for a moment."</P>
<P>"But pray let us proceed," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">
"Ay, Signora, it is be&s;t to be of the
&s;afe &s;ide," ob&s;erved Paulo. "Yonder, be|low,
is Celano, and I hope we &s;hall get &s;afe
hou&s;ed there, before it is quite dark, for
here we have no mountain, that will light
us on our way! Ah! if we were but within
twenty miles of Naples, now,&mdash;and it was
an <HI>illumination.</HI> night!"&mdash;</P>
<P>As they de&s;cended the mountain, Elle|na,
&s;ilent and dejected, abandoned her&s;elf
to reflection. She was too &s;en&s;ible of the
difficulties of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and
too apprehen&s;ive of the influence, which
her determination mu&s;t have on all her fu|ture
life, to be happy, though e&s;caped
from the pri&s;on of San Stefano, and in the
pre&s;ence of Vivaldi, her beloved deliverer
and protector. He ob&s;erved her dejec|tion
with grief, and, not under&s;tanding all
the finer &s;cruples that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, in|terpreted
her re&s;erve into indifference towards
him&s;elf. But he forbore to di&s;turb
her again with a mention of his doubts,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
or fears; and he determined not to urge the
&s;ubject of his late entreaties, till he &s;hould
have placed her in &s;ome &s;ecure a&s;ylum&punc;
where &s;he might feel her&s;elf at perfect li|berty
to accept or to reject his propo&s;al.
By acting with an honour &s;o delicate, he
uncon&s;ciou&s;ly adopted a certain means of
increa&s;ing her e&s;teem and gratitude, and
de&s;erved them the more, &s;ince he had to
endure the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing her by the
delay thus occa&s;ioned to their nuptials.</P>
<P>They reached the town of Celano be|fore
the evening clo&s;ed; when Vivaldi was
reque&s;ted by Ellena to enquire for a con|vent,
where &s;he might be lodged for the
night. He left her at the inn, with Paulo
for her guard, and proceeded on his &s;earch.
The fir&s;t gate he knocked upon belonged
to a convent of Carmelites. It appeared
probable, that the pilgrims of that order,
who had occa&s;ioned him &s;o much di&s;quie|tude,
were hone&s;t brothers of this hou&s;e;
but as it was probable al&s;o, that if they
<PB N="91" REF="92">
were emi&s;&s;aries of the Abbe&s;s of San Stefa|no,
and came to Celano, they would take
up their lodging with a &s;ociety of their
own cla&s;s, in preference to that of any
other, Vivaldi thought it prudent to retire
from their gates without making him&s;elf
known. He pa&s;&s;ed on, therefore, and
&s;oon after arrived at a convent of Domi|nicans,
where he learned, that there were
only two hou&s;es of nuns in Celano, and
that the&s;e admitted no other boarders than
permanent ones.</P>
<P>Vivaldi returned with this intelligence
to Ellena, who endeavoured to reconcile
her&s;elf to the nece&s;&s;ity of remaining where
&s;he was; but Paulo, ever active and zea|lous,
brought intelligence, that at a little
fi&s;hing town, at &s;ome di&s;tance, on the
bank of the lake, was a convent of Ur&s;a|lines,
remarkable for their ho&s;pitality to
&s;trangers. The ob&s;curity of &s;o remote a
place, was another rea&s;on for preferring it
<PB N="92" REF="93">
to Celano, and Vivaldi propo&s;ing to re|move
thither, if Ellena was not too weary
to proceed, &s;he readily, a&s;&s;ented, and they
immediately &s;et off.</P>
<P>"It happens to be a fine night," &s;aid
Paulo, as they left Celano, "and &s;o, Sig|nor,
we cannot well lo&s;e our way; be|&s;ides,
they &s;ay, there is but one. The town
we are going to lies yonder on the edge of
the lake, about a mile and a hair off. I
think I can &s;ee a gray &s;teeple or two, a
little to the right of that wood where the
water gleams &s;o."</P>
<P>"No, Paulo," replied Vivaldi, after
looking attentively. "I perceive what
you mean; but tho&s;e are not the points of
&s;teeples, they are only the tops of &s;ome
tall cypre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Signor, they are too ta|pering
for trees; that mu&s;t &s;urely be the
town. This road, however, will lead us
right, for there is no other to puzzle us,
as they &s;ay,"</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">
"This cool and balmy air revives me,"
&s;aid Ellena; "and what a &s;oothing &s;hade
prevails over the &s;cene! How &s;oftened,
yet how di&s;tinct, is every near object;
how &s;weetly dubious the more removed
ones; while the mountains beyond cha|racter
them&s;elves &s;ublimely upon the &s;till
glowing horizon."</P>
<P>"Ob&s;erve, too," &s;aid Vivaldi, "how
their broken &s;ummits, tipt with the beams
that have &s;et to our lower region, exhibit
the portraiture of towers and ca&s;tles, and
embattled ramparts, which &s;eemed de&s;ign|ed
to guard them again&s;t the enemies,
that may come by the clouds."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Ellena, "the mountains
them&s;elves di&s;play a &s;ublimity, that &s;eems
to belong to a higher world; their be|&s;iegers
ought not to be of this earth; they
can be only &s;pirits of the air."</P>
<P>"They can be nothing el&s;e, Signora,"
&s;aid Paulo, "for nothing of this earth can
reach them. See! lady, they have &s;ome
<PB N="94" REF="95">
of the qualities of your &s;pirits, too; &s;ee!
how they change their &s;hapes and colours,
as the &s;un-beams &s;ink. And now, how
gray and dim they grow! See but how
fa&s;t they vani&s;h!"</P>
<P>"Every thing repo&s;es," &s;aid Vivaldi."
"who would willingly travel in the day,
when Italy has &s;uch nights as this!"</P>
<P>"Signor, that <HI>is</HI> the town before us,"
&s;aid Paulo, "for now I can di&s;cern, plain
enough, the &s;pires of convents; and there
goes a light! Hah, hah! and there is a
bell, too, chiming from one of the &s;pires!
The monks are going to ma&s;s; would we
were going to &s;upper, Signor!"</P>
<P>"That chime is nearer than the place
you point to, Paulo, and I doubt whether
it comes from the &s;ame quarter."</P>
<P>"Hark! Signor, the air wafts the &s;ound!
and now it is gone again."</P>
<P>"Yes, I believe you are right, Paulo,
and that we have not far to go."</P>
<P>The travellers de&s;cended the gradual
<PB N="95" REF="96">
&s;lopes, towards the &s;hore; and Paulo,
&s;ome time after, exclaimed, "See, Signor,
where another light glides along See! it
is reflected on the lake."</P>
<P>"I hear the faint da&s;hing of waves,
now," &s;aid Ellena, "and the &s;ound of
oars, too. But ob&s;erve, Paulo, the light
is not in the town, it is in the boat that
moves yonder."</P>
<P>"Now it retreats, and trembles in a
lengthening line upon the waters," &s;aid
Vivaldi. "We have been too ready to be|lieve
what we wi&s;h and have yet far to
go."</P>
<P>The &s;hore they were approaching form|ed
a &s;pacious bay for the lake, immediate|ly
below. Dark woods &s;eemed to &s;pread
along the banks, and a&s;cend among the
cultivated &s;lopes towards the mountains;
except where, here and there, cliffs, bend|ing
over the water, were di&s;tingui&s;hed
through the twilight by the whitene&s;s of
their lime&s;tone precipices. Within the
<PB N="96" REF="97">
bay, the town became gradually vi&s;ible;
lights twinkled between the trees, appear|ing
and vani&s;hing; like the &s;tars of a cloudy
night; and, at length was heard the me|lancholy
&s;ong of boatmen, who were fi&s;h|ing
near the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Other &s;ounds &s;oon after &s;truck the ear.
"O, what merry notes!" exclaimed Paulo,
"they make my heart dance. See! Sigr|nora,
there is a group, footing it away &s;o
gaily on the bank of the lake, yonder, by
tho&s;e trees. O, what a merry &s;et! Would
I were among them! that is, I mean, if
you, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> and the Signora were not
here."</P>
<P>"Well corrected, Paulo."</P>
<P>"It is a fe&s;tival, I fancy," ob&s;erved Vi|valdi.
"The&s;e pea&s;ants of the lake can
make the moments fly as gaily as the vo|luptuaries
of the city, it &s;eems."</P>
<P>"O! what merry mu&s;ic!" repeated
Paulo. "Ah! how often I have footed it
as joyou&s;ly on the beach at Naples, after
<PB N="97" REF="98">
&s;un-&s;et, of a fine night, like this; with
&s;uch a plea&s;ant fre&s;h breeze to cool one!
Ah! there are none like the fi&s;hermen of
Naples for a dance by moonlight; how
lightly they do trip it! O! if I was but
there now! That is, I mean, if you,
<HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> and the Signora were there too.
O! what merry notes!"</P>
<P>"We thank you, good Signor Paulo,"
&s;aid Vivaldi, "and I tru&s;t we &s;hall all be
there &s;oon; when you &s;hall trip it away,
with as joyous an heart as the be&s;t of
them."</P>
<P>The travellers now entered the town,
which con&s;i&s;ted of one &s;treet, &s;traggling
along the margin of the lake; and having
enquired for the Ur&s;aline convent, were
directed to it's gates. The portre&s;s ap|peared
immediately upon-the ringing of the
bell, and carried a me&s;&s;age to the Ab|be&s;s,
who as quickly returned an invita|tion
to Ellena. She alighted, and fol|lowed
the portre&s;s to the parlour, while
<PB N="98" REF="99">
Vivaldi remained at the gate, till he &s;hould
know whether &s;he approved of her new
lodging. A &s;econd invitation induced him,
al&s;o, to alight; he was admitted to the
grate, and offered refre&s;hment, which,
however, he declined &s;taying to accept,
as he had yet a lodging to &s;eek for the
night. The Abbe&s;s, on learning this cir|cum&s;tance,
courteou&s;ly recommended him
to a neighbouring &s;ociety of Benedictines,
and de&s;ired him to mention her name to
the Abbot.</P>
<P>Vivaldi then took leave of Ellena, and,
though it was only for a few hours, he left
her with dejection, and with &s;ome degree
of apprehen&s;ion for her &s;afety, which,
though circum&s;tances could not ju&s;tify
him in admitting, he could not entirely
&s;ubdue. She &s;hared his dejection, but not
his fears, when the door clo&s;ed after him,
and &s;he found her&s;elf once more among
&s;trangers. The forlornne&s;s of her feelings
could not be entirely overcome by the at|tentions
<PB N="99" REF="100">
of the Abbe&s;s; and there was a
degree of curio&s;ity, and even of &s;crutiny,
expre&s;&s;ed in the looks of &s;ome of the &s;i&s;ters,
which &s;eemed more than was due to a
&s;tranger. From &s;uch examination &s;he
eagerly e&s;caped to the apartment allotted
for her, and to the repo&s;e from which &s;he
had &s;o long been withheld.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, meanwhile, had found an ho&s;|pitable
reception with the Benedictines,
who&s;e &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation made the vi&s;it
of a &s;tranger a plea&s;urable novelty to
them. In the eagerne&s;s of conver&s;ation,
and, yielding to the &s;atisfaction which the
mind receives from exerci&s;ing ideas that
have long &s;lept in du&s;ky indolence, and
to the plea&s;ure of admitting new ones, the
Abbot and a few of the brothers &s;at with
Vivaldi to a late hour. When, at length,
the traveller was &s;uffered to retire, other
&s;ubjects than tho&s;e, which had intere&s;ted
his ho&s;t, engaged his thoughts; and he
revolved the means of preventing the
<PB N="100" REF="101">
mi&s;ery that threatened him, in a &s;erious
&s;eparation from Ellena. Now, that &s;he
was received into a re&s;pectable a&s;ylum,
every motive for &s;ilence upon this topic
was done away. He determined, there|fore,
that on the following morning, he
would urge all his rea&s;ons and entreaties
for an immediate marriage; and among
the brothers of the Benedictine, he had
little doubt of prevailing with one to &s;o|lemnize
the nuptials, which he believed
would place his happine&s;s and Ellena's
peace, beyond the influence of malignant
po&s;&s;ibilities.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE Vivaldi and Ellena were on
the way from San Stefano, the Marche&s;e
Vivaldi was &s;uffering the utmo&s;t vexation,
re&s;pecting his &s;on; and the Marche&s;a felt
not le&s;s apprehen&s;ion, that the abode of
Ellena might be di&s;covered; yet this
fear did not withhold her from mingling
in all the gaieties of Naples. Her a&s;&s;em|blies
were, as u&s;ual, among the mo&s;t
brilliant of that voluptuous city, and &s;he
patronized, as zealou&s;ly as before, the
&s;trains of her favourite compo&s;er. But,
notwith&s;tanding this perpetual di&s;&s;ipation,
her thoughts frequently withdrew them|&s;elves
<PB N="102" REF="103">
from the &s;cene, and dwelt on gloomy
forebodings of di&s;appointed pride.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance, which rendered her
particularly &s;u&s;ceptible to &s;uch di&s;appoint|ment
at this time, was, that overtures of
alliance had been lately made to the Mar|che&s;e,
by the father of a lady, who was held
&s;uitable, in every con&s;ideration, to become
his daughter; and who&s;e wealth rendered
the union particularly de&s;irable at a time,
when the expences of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
as was nece&s;&s;ary to the vanity of the
Marche&s;a, con&s;iderably exceeded his in|come,
large as it was.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a's temper had been thus
irritated by the contemplation of her &s;on's
conduct in an affair, which &s;o materially
affected the fortune, and, as &s;he believed,
the honour of his family; when a courier
from the Abbe&s;s of San Stefano brought
intelligence of the flight of Ellena with Vi|valdi.
She was in a di&s;po&s;ition, which
heightened di&s;appointment into fury; and
<PB N="103" REF="104">
&s;he forfeited, by the tran&s;ports to which
&s;he yielded, the degree of pity that other|wi&s;e
was due to a mother, who believed
her only &s;on to have &s;acrificed his family and
him&s;elf to an unworthy pa&s;&s;ion. She be|lieved,
that he was now married, and irre|coverably
lo&s;t. Scarcely able to endure
the agony of this conviction, &s;he &s;ent for
her ancient advi&s;er Schedoni, that &s;he
might, at lea&s;t, have the relief of expre&s;&s;|ing
her emotions; and of examining whe|ther
there remained a po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;&s;olv|ing
the&s;e long-dreaded nuptials. The
phrenzy of pa&s;&s;ion, however, did not &s;o far
overcome her circum&s;pection as to compel
her to acquaint the Marche&s;e with the
contents of the Abbe&s;s's letter, before &s;he
had con&s;ulted with her Confe&s;&s;or. She
knew that the principles of her hu&s;band
were too ju&s;t, upon the grand points of
morality, to &s;uffer him to adopt the mea|&s;ures
&s;he might judge nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;he
avoided informing him of the marriage of
<PB N="104" REF="105">
his &s;on, until the means of counteracting
it &s;hould have been &s;ugge&s;ted and accom|pli&s;hed,
however de&s;perate &s;uch means
might be.</P>
<P>Schedoni was not to be found. Tri|fling
circum&s;tances encrea&s;e the irritation
of a mind in &s;uch a &s;tate as was her's.
The delay of an opportunity for unbur|thening
her heart to Schedoni, was hardly
to be endured; another and another
me&s;&s;enger were di&s;patched to her Con|fe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"My mi&s;tre&s;s has committed &s;ome
great &s;in, truely!" &s;aid the &s;ervant, who
had been twice to the convent, within the
la&s;t half hour. "It mu&s;t lie heavy on
her con&s;cience, in good truth, &s;ince &s;he
cannot &s;upport it for one half hour. Well!
the rich have this comfort, however, that,
let them be ever &s;o guilty, they can buy
them&s;elves innocent again, in the twink|ling
of a ducat. Now a poor man might
be a month before he recovered his inno|cence,
<PB N="105" REF="106">
and that, too, not till after many a|bout
of hard flogging.".</P>
<P>In the evening Schedoni came, but it
was only to confirm her wor&s;t fear. He,
too, had heard of the e&s;cape of Ellena, as
well as that &s;he was on the lake of Celano,
and was married to Vivaldi. How he had
obtained this information he did not chu&s;e
to di&s;clo&s;e, but he mentioned &s;o many mi|nute
circum&s;tances in confirmation of it's
truth, and appeared to be &s;o perfectly con|vinced
of the facts he related, that the
Marche&s;a believed them, as implicitly as
him&s;elf; and her pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed
all bounds of decorum;</P>
<P>Schedoni ob&s;erved, with dark and &s;ilent
plea&s;ure, the turbulent exce&s;s of her feel|ings;
and perceived that the moment was
now arrived, when he might command
them to his purpo&s;e, &s;o as to render his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance indi&s;pen&s;able to her repo&s;e; and
probably &s;o as to accompli&s;h the revenge
he had long meditated again&s;t Vivaldi,
<PB N="106" REF="107">
without hazarding the favour of the Mar|che&s;a.
So far was he from attempting to
&s;ooth her &s;ufferings, that he continued to
irritate her re&s;entment, and exa&s;perate her
pride; effecting this, at the &s;ame time,
with &s;uch imperceptible art, that he ap|peared
only to be palliating the conduct of
Vivaldi, and endeavouring to con&s;ole his
di&s;tracted mother.</P>
<P>"This is a ra&s;h &s;tep, certainly," &s;aid
the Confe&s;&s;or;" but he is young, very
young, and, therefore, does not fore&s;ee the
con&s;equence to which it leads. He does
not perceive how &s;eriou&s;ly it will affect the
dignity of his hou&s;e;&mdash;how much it will
depreciate his con&s;equence with the court,
with the nobles of his own rank, and even
with the plebeians, with whom he has con|de&s;cended
to connect him&s;elf. Intoxi|cated
with the pa&s;&s;ions of youth, he does
not weigh the value of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings,
which wi&s;dom and the experience of ma|turer
age know how to e&s;timate. He ne|glects
<PB N="107" REF="108">
them <HI>only</HI> becau&s;e he does not per|ceive
their influence in &s;ociety, and that
lightly to re&s;ign them, is to degrade him|&s;elf
in the view of almo&s;t every mind.
Unhappy young man! he is to be pitied
fully as much as blamed."</P>
<P>"Your excu&s;es, reverend father," &s;aid
the tortured Marche&s;a, "prove the good|ne&s;s
of your heart; but they illu&s;trate,
al&s;o, the degeneracy of his mind, and detail
the full extent of the effects which he has
brought upon his family. It affords me
no con&s;olation to know, that this degra|dation
proceeds from his head, rather than
his heart; it is &s;ufficient that he has in|curred
it, and that no po&s;&s;ibility remains
of throwing off the misfortune."
"Perhaps that is affirming too much,"
ob&s;erved Schedoni.</P>
<P>"How, father!" &s;aid the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"Perhaps a po&s;&s;ibility does remain,"
&s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Point it out to me, good father! I
do not perceive it."
<PB N="108" REF="109">
"Nay, my lady," replied the &s;ubtle
Schedoni, correcting him&s;elf, "I am by no
means a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch po&s;&s;ibility does
exi&s;t. My &s;olicitude for your tranquillity,
and for the honour of your hou&s;e, makes
me &s;o unwilling to relinqui&s;h hope, that,
perhaps, I only imagine a po&s;&s;ibility in your
favour. Let me con&s;ider.&mdash;Alas! the
misfortune, &s;evere as it is, mu&s;t be en|dured;
&mdash;there remain no means of e&s;cap|ing
from it."</P>
<P>"It was cruel of you, father, to &s;ugge&s;t
a hope which you could not ju&s;tify," ob|&s;erved
the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t excu&s;e my extreme &s;olici|tude,
then," replied the Confe&s;&s;or. "But
how is it po&s;&s;ible for me to fee a family of
your ancient e&s;timation brought into &s;uch
circum&s;tances; its honours blighted by
the folly of a thoughtle&s;s boy, without feel|ing
&s;orrow and indignation, and looking
round for even &s;ome de&s;perate means of
delivering it from di&s;grace." He pau&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">
"Di&s;grace!" exclaimed the Marche&s;a;
"father, you&mdash;you&mdash;Di&s;grace!&mdash;The
word is a &s;trong one, but&mdash;it is, alas!
ju&s;t. And &s;hall we &s;ubmit to this?&mdash;Is
it po&s;&s;ible we <HI>can</HI> &s;ubmit to it?"</P>
<P>"There is no remedy," &s;aid Schedoni,
coolly.</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed the Marche|&s;a,
"that there &s;hould be no law to pre|vent,
or, at lea&s;t, to puni&s;h &s;uch criminal
marriages!"</P>
<P>"It is much to be lamented," replied
Schedoni.</P>
<P>"The woman who obtrudes her&s;elf up|on
a family, to di&s;honour it," continued
the Marche&s;a, "de&s;erves a puni&s;hment
nearly equal to that of a &s;tate criminal,
&s;ince &s;he injures tho&s;e who be&s;t &s;upport
the &s;tate. She ought to &s;uffer"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Not nearly, but quite equal, "inter|rupted
the Confe&s;&s;or, "&s;he de&s;erves&mdash;death!"</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, and there was a moment
<PB N="110" REF="111">
of profound &s;ilence, till he added&mdash;"for
death only can obliviate the degradation
&s;he has occa&s;ioned; her death alone can
re&s;tore the original &s;plendor of the line &s;he
would have &s;ullied."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed again, but the Marche&s;a &s;till
remaining &s;ilent, he added, "I have often
marvelled that our lawgivers &s;hould have
failed to perceive the ju&s;tne&s;s, nay the ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
of &s;uch puni&s;hment!"</P>
<P>"It is a&s;toni&s;hing," &s;aid the Marche&s;a,
thoughtfully, "that a regard for their own
honour did not &s;ugge&s;t it."</P>
<P>"Ju&s;tice does not the le&s;s exi&s;t, becau&s;e
her laws are neglected," ob&s;erved Schedoni.
A &s;en&s;e of what &s;he commands lives in our
brea&s;ts; and when we fail to obey that &s;en&s;e,
it is to weakne&s;s, not to virtue, that we
yield."</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied the Marche&s;a,
"that truth never yet was doubted;"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, I am not &s;o certain as to
that," &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, "when ju&s;tice
<PB N="111" REF="112">
happens to oppo&s;e prejudice, we are apt to
believe it virtuous to di&s;obey her. For in|&s;tance,
though the law of ju&s;tice demands
the death of this girl, yet becau&s;e the law
of the land forbears to enforce it, you, my
daughter, even you! though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
man's &s;pirit, and his clear perceptions,
would think that virtue bade her live, when
it was only fear!"</P>
<P>"Hah!" exclaimed the Marche&s;a, in a
low voice, "What is that you mean? You
&s;hall find I have a man's courage al&s;o."</P>
<P>"I &s;peak without di&s;gui&s;e," replied Sche|doni,
"my meaning requires none."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a mu&s;ed, and remained
&s;ilent.</P>
<P>"I have done my duty," re&s;umed Sche|doni,
at length. "I have pointed out the
only way that remains for you to e&s;cape
di&s;honour. If my zeal is di&s;plea&s;ing&mdash;but
I have done."</P>
<P>" No, good father, no," &s;aid the Mar|che&s;a;
you mi&s;take the cau&s;e of my emo|tion.
<PB N="112" REF="113">
New ideas, new pro&s;pects, open!&mdash;they
confu&s;e, they di&s;tract me! My mind
has not yet attained &s;ufficient &s;trength to
encounter them; &s;ome woman's weakne&s;s
&s;till lingers at my heart."</P>
<P>"Pardon my incon&s;iderate zeal," &s;aid
Schedoni, with affected humility, "I hBve
been to blame. If your's is a weakne&s;s, it
is, at lea&s;t, an amiable one, and, perhaps,
de&s;erves to be encouraged, rather than
conquered."</P>
<P>"How, father! If it de&s;erves encou|ragement,
it is not a weakne&s;s, but a vir|tue.".</P>
<P>"Be it &s;o," &s;aid Schedoni, coolly, "the
intere&s;t I have felt on this &s;ubject, has,
perhaps, mi&s;led my judgment, and has
made me unju&s;t. Think no more of it,
or, if you do, let it be only to pardon the
zeal I have te&s;tified."</P>
<P>"It does not de&s;erve pardon, but
thanks," replied the Marche&s;a, "not thanks
only, but reward. Good father, I hope it
<PB N="113" REF="114">
will &s;ome time be in my power to prove
the &s;incerity of my words."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or bowed his head.</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t that the &s;ervices you have ren|dered
me, &s;hall be gratefully repaid&mdash;re|warded,
I dare not hope, for what benefit
could po&s;&s;ibly reward a &s;ervice &s;o va&s;t, as it
may, perhaps, be in your power to confer
upon my family! What recompence could
be balanced again&s;t the benefit of having
re&s;cued the honour of an ancient hou&s;e!"</P>
<P>"Your goodne&s;s is beyond my thanks,
or my de&s;ert," &s;aid Schedoni, and he was
again &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a wi&s;hed him to lead her
back to the point, from which &s;he her&s;elf
had deviated, and he &s;eemed determined,
that &s;he &s;hould lead him thither. She
mu&s;ed, and he&s;itated. Her mind was not
yet familiar with atrocious guilt; and the
crime which Schedoni had &s;ugge&s;ted, &s;ome|what
alarmed her. She feared to think,
and &s;till more to name it; yet, &s;o acutely
<PB N="114" REF="115">
&s;u&s;ceptible was her pride, &s;o &s;tern her in|dignation,
and &s;o profound her de&s;ire of
vengeance, that her mind was to&s;&s;ed as on
a tempe&s;tuous ocean, and the&s;e terrible
feelings threatened to overwhelm all the
re&s;idue of humanity in her heart. Sche|doni
ob&s;erved all its progre&s;&s;ive move|ments,
and, like a gaunt tyger, lurked in
&s;ilence, ready to &s;pring forward at the mo|ment
of opportunity.</P>
<P>"It is your advice, then, father," re|&s;umed
the Marche&s;a, after a long pau&s;e,&mdash;"it
is your opinion&mdash;that Ellena."&mdash;She
he&s;itated, de&s;irous that Schedoni
&s;hould anticipate her meaning; but he
cho&s;e to &s;pare his own delicacy rather than
that of the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"You think, then, that this in&s;idious
girl de&s;erves"&mdash;She pau&s;ed again, but
the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till &s;ilent, &s;eemed to wait
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion for what the Marche&s;a
&s;hould deliver.</P>
<P>"I repeat, father, that it is your opi|nion
<PB N="115" REF="116">
this girl de&s;erves &s;evere puni&s;h|ment."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly," replied Schedoni, "Is
it not al&s;o your own?"</P>
<P>"That not any puni&s;hment can be too
&s;evere?" continued the Marche&s;a. "That
ju&s;tice, equally with nece&s;&s;ity, demands
&mdash;her life? Is not this your opinion
too?"</P>
<P>"O! pardon me," &s;aid Schedoni, "I
may have erred; that only <HI>was</HI> my opi|nion;
and when I formed it, I was proba|bly
too much under the influence of zeal
to be ju&s;t. When the heart is warm, how
is it po&s;&s;ible that the judgment can be
cool."</P>
<P>"It is <HI>not</HI> then, your opinion, holy fa|ther,"
&s;aid the Marche&s;a with di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I do not ab&s;olutely &s;ay that," replied
the Confe&s;&s;or.&mdash;But I leave it to your bet|ter
judgment to decide upon its ju&s;tne&s;s."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he ro&s;e to depart. The
Marche&s;a was agitated and perplexed,
<PB N="116" REF="117">
and reque&s;ted he would &s;tay; but he ex|cu&s;ed
him&s;elf by alledging, that it was
the hour when he mu&s;t attend a particular
ma&s;s.</P>
<P>"Well then, holy father, I will occupy
no more of your valuable moments at pre|&s;ent;
but you know how highly I e&s;timate
your advice, and will not refu&s;e, when I
&s;hall at &s;ome future time reque&s;t it.</P>
<P>"I cannot refu&s;e to accept an honour,"
replied the Confe&s;&s;or, with an air of meek|ne&s;s,
"but the &s;ubject you allude to is
delicate"&mdash;</P>
<P>"And therefore I mu&s;t value, and re|quire
your opinion upon it," rejoined the
Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"I would wi&s;h you to value your own,"
replied Schedoni; "you cannot have a
better director."</P>
<P>"You flatter, father."</P>
<P>"I only reply, my daughter."</P>
<P>"On the evening of to-morrow," &s;aid
the Marche&s;a, gravely, "I &s;hall be at ve&s;pers
<PB N="117" REF="118">
in the church of San Nicolo; if you &s;hould
happen to be there, you will probably &s;ee
me, when the &s;ervice is over, and the con|gregation
is departed, in the north cloi&s;ter.
We can there conver&s;e on the &s;ubject
neare&s;t my heart, and without ob&s;ervation.
&mdash;Farewell!"</P>
<P>"Peace be with you, daughter! and
wi&s;dom council your thoughts!" &s;aid Sche|doni,
"I will not fail to vi&s;it San Nicolo."</P>
<P>He folded his hands upon his brea&s;t,
bowed his head, and left the apartment
with the &s;ilent foot&s;tep, that indicates wea|rine&s;s
and con&s;cious duplicity.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a remained in her clo&s;et,
&s;haken by ever-varying pa&s;&s;ions, and ever-fluctuating
opinions; meditating mi&s;ery
for others, and inflicting it only upon
her&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Along the roofs &s;ounds the low peal of Death,</L>
<L>And Con&s;cience trembles to the boding note;</L>
<L>She views his dim form floating o'er the ai&s;les,</L>
<L>She hears my&s;terious murmurs in the air,</L>
<L>And voices, &s;trange and potent, hint the crime</L>
<L>That dwells in thought, within her &s;ecret &s;oul.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Marche&s;a repaired, according to
her appointment, to the church of San Ni|colo,
and, ordering her &s;ervants to remain
with the carriage at a &s;ide-door, entered the
choir, attended only by her woman.</P>
<P>When ve&s;pers had concluded, &s;he lin|gered
till nearly every per&s;on had quitted
the choir, and then walked through the &s;o|litary
ai&s;les to the north cloi&s;ter. Her
heart was as heavy as her &s;tep; for when
is it that peace and evil pa&s;&s;ions dwell to|gether?
As &s;he &s;lowly paced the cloi&s;ters,
&s;he perceived a monk pa&s;&s;ing between the
<PB N="119" REF="120">
pillars, who, as he approached, lifted his
cowl, and &s;he knew him to be Schedoni.</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly ob&s;erved the agitation of
her &s;pirits, and that her purpo&s;e was not
yet determined, according to his hope.
But, though his mind became clouded, his
countenance remained unaltered; it was
grave and thoughtful. The &s;ternne&s;s of
his vulture-eye was, however, &s;omewhat
&s;oftened, and its lids were contracted by
&s;ubtlety.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a bade her woman walk
apart, while &s;he conferred with her Con|fe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"This unhappy boy," &s;aid &s;he, when
the attendant was at &s;ome di&s;tance, "How
much &s;uffering does his folly inflict upon
his family! My good father, I have need
of all your advice and con&s;olation. My
mind is perpetually haunted by a &s;en&s;e of
my misfortune; it has no re&s;pite; awake
or in my dream, this ungrateful &s;on alike
pur&s;ues me! The only relief my heart re|ceives
<PB N="120" REF="121">
is when conver&s;ing with you&mdash;my
only coun&s;ellor, my only di&s;intere&s;ted
friend."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or bowed. "The Marche&s;e
is, no doubt, equally afflicted with your|&s;elf,"
&s;aid he; "but he is, notwith&s;tand|ing,
much more competent to advi&s;e you
on this delicate &s;ubject than I am."</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;e has prejudices, father,
as you well know; he is a &s;en&s;ible man,
but he is &s;ometimes mi&s;taken, and he is
incorrigible in error. He has the faults of
a mind that is merely well di&s;po&s;ed; he is
de&s;titute of the di&s;cernment and the ener|gy
which would make it great. If it is
nece&s;&s;ary to adopt a conduct, that departs
in the &s;malle&s;t degree from tho&s;e common
rules of morality which he has cheri&s;hed,
without examining them, from his infancy,
he is &s;hocked, and &s;hrinks from action.
He cannot di&s;criminate the circum&s;tances,
that render the &s;ame action virtuous or
vicious. How then, father, are we to &s;up|pose
<PB N="121" REF="122">
he would approve of the bold inflic|tions
we meditate?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true!" &s;aid the artful Schedoni,
with an air of admiration.</P>
<P>"We, therefore, mu&s;t not con&s;ult him,"
continued the Marche&s;a," le&s;t he &s;hould
now, as formerly, advance and maintain
objections, to which we cannot yield.
What pa&s;&s;es in conver&s;ation with you,
father, is &s;acred, it goes no farther."</P>
<P>"Sacred as a confe&s;&s;ion!" &s;aid Schedoni,
cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I know not,"&mdash;re&s;umed the Marche|&s;a,
and he&s;itated; "I know not"&mdash;&s;he re|peated
in a yet lower voice, "how this girl
may be di&s;po&s;ed of; and this it is which
di&s;tracts my mind."</P>
<P>"I marvel much at that," &s;aid Schedo|ni.
"With opinions &s;o &s;ingularly ju&s;t,
with a mind &s;o accurate, yet &s;o bold as you
have di&s;played, is it po&s;&s;ible that you can
he&s;itate as to what is to be done! You, my
daughter, will not prove your&s;elf one of
tho&s;e ineffectual declaimers, who can think
<PB N="122" REF="123">
vigorously, but cannot act &s;o! One way,
only, remains for you to pur&s;ue, in the
pre&s;ent in&s;tance; it is the &s;ame which your
&s;uperior &s;agacity pointed out, and taught
me to approve. Is it nece&s;&s;ary for me
to per&s;uade <HI>her,</HI> by whom I am con|vinced!
There is only one way."</P>
<P>"And on that I have been long medi|tating,"
replied the Marche&s;a, "and, &s;hall
I own my weakne&s;s? I cannot yet decide."</P>
<P>"My daughter! can it be po&s;&s;ible that
you &s;hould want courage to &s;oar above vul|gar
prejudice, in action, though not in
opinion?" &s;aid Schedoni, who, perceiving
that his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary to fix her
fluctuating mind, gradually began to &s;teal
forth from the prudent re&s;erve, in which he
had taken &s;helter.</P>
<P>"If this per&s;on was condemned by the
law," he continued, "you would pro|nounce
her &s;entence to be ju&s;t; yet you
dare not, I am humbled while I re|peat
it, you dare not di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;tice your|&s;elf!"</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">
The Marche&s;a, after &s;ome he&s;itation,
&s;aid, "I have not the &s;hield of the law to
protect me, father: and the bolde&s;t virtue
may pau&s;e, when it reaches the utmo&s;t
verge of &s;afety."</P>
<P>"Never!" replied the Confe&s;&s;or, warmly;
"virtue never trembles; it is her glory,
and &s;ublime&s;t attribute to be &s;uperior to
danger; to de&s;pi&s;e it. The be&s;t principle
is not virtue till it reaches this elevation."</P>
<P>A philo&s;opher might, perhaps, have
been &s;urprized to hear two per&s;ons &s;eriou&s;|ly
defining the limits of virtue, at the very
moment in which they meditated the mo&s;t
atrocious crime; a man of the world
would have con&s;idered it to be mere hypo|cri&s;y;
a &s;uppo&s;ition which might have di&s;|clo&s;ed
his general knowledge of manners,
but would certainly have betrayed his
ignorance of the human heart.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a was for &s;ome time &s;ilent
and thoughtful, and then repeated delibe|rately,
"I have not the &s;hield of the law
to protect me."</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">
"But you have the &s;hield of the
church," replied Schedoni; "you &s;hould
not only have protection, but ab&s;olution."</P>
<P>"Ab&s;olution!&mdash;Does virtue&mdash;ju&s;tice,
require ab&s;olution, father?"</P>
<P>"When I mentioned ab&s;olution for the
action which you perceive to be &s;o ju&s;t and
nece&s;&s;ary," replied Schedoni, "I accom|modated
my &s;peech to vulgar prejudice,
and to vulgar weakne&s;s. And, forgive me,
that &s;ince you, my daughter, de&s;cended
from the loftine&s;s of your &s;pirit to regret
the &s;hield of the law, I endeavoured to
con&s;ole you, by offering a &s;hield to con|&s;cience.
But enough of this; let us re|turn
to argument. This girl is put out of
the way of committing more mi&s;chief, of
injuring the peace and dignity of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
family; &s;he is &s;ent to an eternal
&s;leep, before her time.&mdash;Where is the
crime, where is the evil of this? On the
contrary, you perceive, and you have con|vinced
me, that it is only &s;trict ju&s;tice,
only &s;elf-defence."</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126">
The Marche&s;a was attentive, and the
Confe&s;&s;or added, "She is not immortal;
and the few years more, that might have
been allotted her, &s;he de&s;erves to forfeit,
&s;ince &s;he would have employed them in
cankering the honour of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Speak low, father," &s;aid the Marche|&s;a,
though he &s;poke almo&s;t in a whi&s;per;
"the cloi&s;ter appears &s;olitary, yet &s;ome
per&s;on may lurk behind tho&s;e pillars.
Advi&s;e me how this bu&s;ine&s;s may be ma|naged;
I am ignorant of the particular
means."</P>
<P>"There is &s;ome hazard in the accom|pli&s;hment
of it, I grant," replied Schedo|ni;
"I know not whom you may confide
in.&mdash;The men who make a trade of
blood"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid the Marche&s;a, looking
round through the twilight&mdash;"a &s;tep!"</P>
<P>"It is the Friar's, yonder, who cro&s;&s;es to
the choir," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">
They were watchful for a few moments,
and then he re&s;umed the &s;ubject. "Mer|cenaries
ought not to be tru&s;ted,"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yet who but mercenaries"&mdash;inter|rupted
the Marche&s;a, and in&s;tantly checked
her&s;elf. But the que&s;tion thus implied,
did not e&s;cape the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Pardon my a&s;toni&s;hment," &s;aid he,
"at the incon&s;i&s;tency, or, what &s;hall I ven|ture
to call it? of your opinions! After
the acutene&s;s you have di&s;played on &s;ome
points, is it po&s;&s;ible you can doubt, that
principle may both prompt and perform
the deed? Why &s;hould we he&s;itate to do
what we judge to be right?"</P>
<P>"Ah! reverend father," &s;aid the Mar|che&s;a,
with emotion," but where &s;hall we
find another like your&s;elf&mdash;another, who
not only can perceive with ju&s;tne&s;s, but
will act with energy."</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Such a friend is above all e&s;timation;
but where &s;hall we &s;eek him?"</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="128">
"Daughter!" &s;aid the Monk, emphati|cally,
"my zeal for your family is al&s;o
above all calculation."</P>
<P>"Good father," replied the Marche&s;a,
comprehending his full meaning, "I know
not how to thank you."</P>
<P>"Silence is &s;ometimes eloquence," &s;aid
Schedoni, &s;ignificantly.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a mu&s;ed; for her con|&s;cience
al&s;o was eloquent. She tried to
overcome its voice, but it would be heard;
and &s;ometimes &s;uch &s;tarts of horrible con|viction
came over her mind, that &s;he felt
as one who, awaking from a dream, opens
his eyes only to mea&s;ure the depth of the
precipice on which he totters. In &s;uch
moments &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed, that &s;he had
pau&s;ed for an in&s;tant upon a &s;ubject &s;o
terrible as that of murder. The &s;ophi&s;try
of the Confe&s;&s;or, together with the incon|&s;i&s;tencies
which he had betrayed, and
which had not e&s;caped the notice of the
Marche&s;a, even at the time they were ut|tered,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
though &s;he had been uncon&s;cious of
her own, then became more &s;trongly appa|rent,
and &s;he almo&s;t determined to &s;uffer
the poor Ellena to live. But returning
pa&s;&s;ion, like a wave that has recoiled from
the &s;hore, afterwards came with recollect|ed
energy, and &s;wept from her feeble mind
the barriers, which rea&s;on and con&s;cience
had begun to rear.</P>
<P>"This confidence with which you have
thought proper to honour me," &s;aid Sche|doni,
at length, and pau&s;ed; "This affair,
&s;o momentous"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ay, this affair," interrupted the Mar|che&s;a,
in a hurried manner,&mdash;"but when,
and where, good father? Being once con|vinced,
I am anxious to have it &s;ettled."</P>
<P>"That mu&s;t be as occa&s;ion offers," re|plied
the Monk, thoughtfully.&mdash;"On the
&s;hore of the Adriatic, in the province of
Apulia, not far from Manfredonia, is a
hou&s;e that might &s;uit the purpo&s;e. It is
a lone dwelling on the beach, and con|cealed
<PB N="129" REF="130">
from travellers, among the fore&s;ts,
which &s;pread for many miles along the
coa&s;t."</P>
<P>"And the people?" &s;aid the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"Ay, daughter, or why travel &s;o far as
Apulia? It is inhabited by one poor man,
who &s;u&s;tains a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence by fi&s;h|ing.
I know him, and could unfold the
rea&s;ons of his &s;olitary life;&mdash;but no mat|ter,
it is &s;ufficient that <HI>I know him.".</HI></P>
<P>"And would tru&s;t him, father?"</P>
<P>"Ay, lady, with the life of this girl&mdash;though
&s;carcely with my own."</P>
<P>"How! If he is &s;uch a villain he may not
be tru&s;ted! think further. But now, you
objected to a mercenary, yet this man is
one!"</P>
<P>"Daughter, he may be tru&s;ted, when it
is in &s;uch a ca&s;e; he is &s;afe and &s;ure. I
have rea&s;on to know him."</P>
<P>"Name your rea&s;ons, father."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or was &s;ilent, and his coun|tenance
a&s;&s;umed a very peculiar character;
<PB N="130" REF="131">
it was more terrible than u&s;ual, and over|&s;pread
with a dark, cadaverous hue of
mingled anger and guilt. The Marche&s;a
&s;tarted involuntarily as, pa&s;&s;ing by a win|dow,
the evening gleam that fell there, di&s;|covered
it; and for the fir&s;t time &s;he wi&s;h|ed,
that &s;he had not committed her&s;elf &s;o
wholly to his power. But the die was now
ca&s;t; it was too late to be prudent; and
&s;he again demanded his rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>"No matter," &s;aid Schedoni, in a &s;tifled
voice&mdash;"&s;he dies!"</P>
<P>"By his hands?" a&s;ked the Marche&s;a,
with &s;trong emotion. "Think, once more,
father."</P>
<P>They were both again &s;ilent and thought|ful.
The Marche&s;a, at length, &s;aid, "Fa|ther,
I rely upon your integrity and pru|dence;"
and &s;he laid a very flattering em|pha&s;is
upon the word integrity. "But I
conjure you to let this bu&s;ine&s;s be fini&s;hed

of this world, and not to tru&s;t the accom|pli&s;hment
<PB N="131" REF="132">
of it to a &s;econd per&s;on." She
pau&s;ed, and then added, "I would not
willingly owe &s;o va&s;t a debt of obligation
to any other than your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Your reque&s;t, daughter, that I would
not confide this bu&s;ine&s;s to a &s;econd per|&s;on,"
&s;aid Schedoni, with di&s;plea&s;ure, "can|not
be accorded to. Can you &s;uppo&s;e,
that I, my&s;elf"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Can I doubt that principle may both
prompt and perform the deed," inter|rupted
the Marche&s;a with quickne&s;s,
and anticipating his meaning, while &s;he
retorted upon him his former words.
"Why &s;hould we he&s;itate to do what we
judge to be right?"</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of Schedoni alone indicated
his di&s;plea&s;ure, which the Marche&s;a imme|diately
under&s;tood.</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider, good father," &s;he added
&s;ignificantly, "how painful it mu&s;t be to
me, to owe to infinite an obligation to
a &s;tranger, or to any other than &s;o highly
valued a friend as your&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">
Schedoni, while he detected her mean|ing,
and per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he de&s;pi&s;|ed
the flattery, with which &s;he &s;o thinly
veiled it, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly &s;uffered his &s;elf-love
to be &s;oothed by the compliment.
He bowed his head, in &s;ignal of con&s;ent to
her wi&s;h.</P>
<P>"Avoid violence, if that be po&s;&s;ible,"
&s;he added, immediately comprehending
him, "but let her die quickly! The pu|ni&s;hment
is due to the crime."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a happened, as &s;he &s;aid this,
to ca&s;t her eyes upon the in&s;cription over
a Confe&s;&s;ional, where appeared, in black
letters, the&s;e awful words, "<HI>God hears
thee!".</HI> It appeared an awful warning.
Her countenance changed; it had &s;truck
upon her heart. Schedoni was too much
engaged by his own thoughts to ob&s;erve,
or under&s;tand her &s;ilence. She &s;oon reco|vered
her&s;elf; and con&s;idering that this
was a common in&s;cription for Confe&s;|&s;ionals,
di&s;regarded what &s;he had at fir&s;t
<PB N="133" REF="134">
con&s;idered as a peculiar admonition; yet
&s;ome moments elap&s;ed, before &s;he could
renew the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"You was &s;peaking of a place, father,"
re&s;umed the Marche&s;a&mdash;"you men|tioned
a"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ay," muttered the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till
mu&s;ing,&mdash;"in a chamber of that hou&s;e
there is"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What noi&s;e is that?" &s;aid the Mar|che&s;a,
interrupting him. They li&s;tened. A few low and querulous notes of the
organ &s;ounded at a di&s;tance, and &s;topped
again.</P>
<P>"What mournful mu&s;ic is that?" &s;aid
the Marche&s;a in a faultering voice, "It
was touched by a fearful hand! Ve&s;pers
were over long ago!"</P>
<P>"Daughter," &s;aid Schedoni, &s;ome|what
&s;ternly, "you &s;aid you had a man's
courage. Alas! you have a woman's
heart."</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, father; I know not why
<PB N="134" REF="135">
I feel this agitation, but I will command
it. That chamber?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"In that chamber," re&s;umed the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
"is a &s;ecret door, con&s;tructed long
ago."&mdash;</P>
<P>"And for what purpo&s;e con&s;tructed?"
&s;aid the fearful Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, daughter; 'tis &s;ufficient
that it is there; we will make a good u&s;e
of it. Through that door&mdash;in the night&mdash;when
&s;he &s;leeps"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I comprehend you," &s;aid the Marche|&s;a,
"I comprehend you. But why, you
have your rea&s;ons, no doubt, but why the
nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ecret door in a hou&s;e which
you &s;ay is &s;o lonely&mdash;inhabited by only
one per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"A pa&s;&s;age leads to the &s;ea," continued
Schedoni, without replying to the que&s;|tion.
"There, on the &s;hore, when dark|ne&s;s
covers it; there, plunged amid&s;t the
waves, no &s;tain &s;hall hint of"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hark!" interrupted the Marche&s;a,
&s;tarting, "that note again!"</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">
The organ &s;ounded faintly from the
choir, and pau&s;ed, as before. In the next
moment, a &s;low chaunting of voices was
heard, mingling with the ri&s;ing peal, in a
&s;train particularly melancholy and &s;o|lemn.</P>
<P>"Who is dead? &s;aid the Marche&s;a,
changing countenance; "it is a requiem!"</P>
<P>"Peace be with the departed!" ex|claimed
Schedoni, and cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf;
"Peace re&s;t with his &s;oul!"</P>
<P>"Hark! to that chaunt!" &s;aid the Mar|che&s;a,
in a trembling voice; "it is a fir&s;t
requiem; the &s;oul has but ju&s;t quitted
the body!"</P>
<P>They li&s;tened in &s;ilence. The Marche|&s;a
was much affected; her complexion
varied at every in&s;tant; her breathings
were &s;hort and interrupted, and &s;he even
&s;hed a few tears, but they were tho&s;e of
de&s;pair, rather than of &s;orrow. "That
body is now cold," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,
"which but an hour ago was warm and
<PB N="136" REF="137">
animated! Tho&s;e fine &s;en&s;es are clo&s;ed in
death! And to this condition would I re|duce
a being like my&s;elf! Oh, wretched,
wretched mother! to what has the folly of
a &s;on reduced thee!"</P>
<P>She turned from the Confe&s;&s;or, and
walked alone in the cloi&s;ter. Her agita|tion
encrea&s;ed; &s;he wept without re&s;traint,
for her veil and the evening gloom con|cealed
her, and her &s;ighs were lo&s;t amid&s;t
the mu&s;ic of the choir.</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;carcely le&s;s di&s;turbed,
but his were emotions of apprehen&s;ion and
contempt. "Behold, what is woman!"
&s;aid he&mdash;"The &s;lave of her pa&s;&s;ions, the
dupe of her &s;en&s;es! When pride and re|venge
&s;peak in her brea&s;t, &s;he defies ob|&s;tacles,
and laughs at crimes! A&s;&s;ail but
her &s;en&s;es, let mu&s;ic, for in&s;tance, touch
&s;ome feeble chord of her heart, and echo
to her fancy, and lo! all her perceptions
change:&mdash;&s;he &s;hrinks from the act &s;he had
but an in&s;tant before believed meritorious,
<PB N="137" REF="138">
yields to &s;ome new emotion, and &s;inks&mdash;the
victim of a &s;ound! O, weak and con|temptible
being!"</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, at lea&s;t, &s;eemed to ju&s;ti|fy
his ob&s;ervations. The de&s;perate pa&s;|&s;ions,
which had re&s;i&s;ted every remon|&s;trance
of rea&s;on and humanity, were van|qui&s;hed
only by other pa&s;&s;ions; and, her
&s;en&s;es touched by the mournful melody of
mu&s;ic, and her &s;uper&s;titious fears awaken|ed
by the occurrence of a requiem for the
dead, at the very moment when &s;he was
planning murder, &s;he yielded, for a while,
to the united influence of pity and terror.
Her agitation did not &s;ub&s;ide; but &s;he
returned to the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"We will conver&s;e on this bu&s;ine&s;s at
&s;ome future time," &s;aid &s;he; "at pre&s;ent,
my &s;pirits are di&s;ordered. Good night,
father! Remember me in your ori|&s;ons."</P>
<P>"Peace be with you, lady!" &s;aid
the Confe&s;&s;or, bowing gravely, "You
<PB N="138" REF="139">
&s;hall not be forgotten. Be re&s;olute, and
your&s;elf."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a beckoned her woman to
approach, when, drawing her veil clo&s;er,
and leaning upon the attendant's arm, &s;he
left the cloi&s;ter. Schedoni remained for
a moment on the &s;pot, looking after her,
till her figure was lo&s;t in the gloom of the
long per&s;pective; he then, with thought|ful
&s;teps, quitted the cloi&s;ter by another
door. He was di&s;appointed, but he did
not de&s;pair.</P>

<P>WHILE the Marche&s;a and the Monk
were thus meditating con&s;piracies again&s;t
Ellena, &s;he was &s;till in the Ur&s;aline con|vent
on the lake of Celano. In this ob|&s;cure
&s;anctuary, indi&s;po&s;ition, the con&s;e|quence
of the long and &s;evere anxiety &s;he
had &s;uffered, compelled her to remain. A
fever was on her &s;pirits, and an univer&s;al
la&s;&s;itude prevailed over her frame; which
became the more effectual, from her very
&s;olicitude to conquer it. Every approach|ing
<PB N="140" REF="141">
day &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould be able to
pur&s;ue her journey homeward, yet every day
found her as incapable of travelling as the
la&s;t, and the &s;econd week was already gone,
before the fine air of Celano, and the tran|quillity
of her a&s;ylum, began to revive her.
Vivaldi, who was her daily vi&s;itor at the
grate of the convent; and who, watching
over her with inten&s;e &s;olicitude, had hi|therto
forbore to renew a &s;ubject, which,
by agitating her &s;pirits, might affect her
health, now, that her health &s;trengthened,
ventured gradually to mention his fears left
the place of her retreat &s;hould be di&s;co|vered,
and left he yet might irrecoverably
lo&s;e her, unle&s;s &s;he would approve of their
&s;peedy marriage. At every vi&s;it he now
urged the &s;ubject, repre&s;ented the dangers
that &s;urrounded them, and repeated his ar|guments
and entreaties; for now, when
he believed that time was pre&s;&s;ing forward
fatal evils, he could no longer attend to
the delicate &s;cruples, that bade him be
<PB N="141" REF="142">
&s;paring in entreaty. Ellena, had &s;he obey|ed
the dictates of her heart, would have
rewarded his attachment and his &s;ervices,
by a frank approbation of his propo&s;al;
but the objections which rea&s;on exhibited
again&s;t &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, &s;he could neither
overcome or di&s;regard.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after he had again repre&s;ented
their pre&s;ent dangers, and claimed the pro|mi&s;e
of her hand, received in the pre&s;ence
of her decea&s;ed relative, Signora Bianchi,
gently ventured to remind her, that an
event as &s;udden as lamentable, had fir&s;t
deferred their nuptials, and that if Bianchi
had lived, Ellena would have be&s;towed,
long &s;ince, the vows he now &s;olicited.
Again he intreated her, by every &s;acred and
tender recollection, to conclude the fearful
uncertainty of their fate, and to be&s;tow up|on
him the right to protect her, before they
ventured forth from this temporary a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Ellena immediately admitted the &s;acred|ne&s;s
of the promi&s;e, which &s;he had formerly
<PB N="142" REF="143">
given, and a&s;&s;ured Vivaldi that &s;he con&s;i|dered
her&s;elf as indi&s;&s;olubly bound to wed
him as if it had been given at the altar;
but &s;he objected to a confirmation of it,
till his family &s;hould &s;eem willing to re|ceive
her for their daughter; when, forget|ting
the injuries &s;he had received from
them, &s;he would no longer refu&s;e their al|liance.
She added, that Vivaldi ought to
be more jealous of the dignity of the wo|man,
whom he honoured with his e&s;teem,
than to permit her making a greater con|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Vivaldi felt the full force of this appeal;
he recollected, with angui&s;h, circum|&s;tances
of which &s;he was happily ignorant,
but which &s;erved to &s;trengthen with him
the ju&s;tne&s;s of her reproof. And, as the
a&s;per&s;ions which the Marche&s;e had thrown
upon her name, crowded to his memory,
pride and indignation &s;welled his heart,
and &s;o far overcame apprehen&s;ion of ha|zard,
that he formed a momentary re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="143" REF="144">
to abandon every other con&s;ideration,
to that of a&s;&s;erting the re&s;pect which was
due to Ellena, and to forbear, claiming her
for his wife, till his family &s;hould make
acknowledgment of their error, and wil|lingly
admit her in the rank of their child.
But this re&s;olution was as tran&s;ient as
plau&s;ible; other con&s;iderations, and for|mer
fears pre&s;&s;ed upon him. He per|ceived
the &s;trong improbability, that they
would ever make a voluntary &s;acrifice of
their pride to his love; or yield mi&s;takes,
nurtured by prejudice and by willing indul|gence,
to truth and a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice. In
the mean time, the plans, which would be
formed for &s;eparating him from Ellena,
might &s;ucceed, and he &s;hould lo&s;e her for
ever. Above all, it appeared, that the be&s;t,
the only method, which remained for con|futing
the daring a&s;per&s;ions that had af|fected
her name, was, by proving the high
re&s;pect he him&s;elf felt for her, and pre&s;ent|ing
her to the world in the &s;acred charac|ter
<PB N="144" REF="145">
of his wife. The&s;e con&s;iderations
quickly determined him to per&s;evere in
his &s;uit; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to urge
them to Ellena, &s;ince the circum&s;tances
they mu&s;t unfold, would not only &s;hock
her delicacy and afflict her heart, but
would furni&s;h the proper pride &s;he cheri&s;h|ed
with new arguments again&s;t approach|ing
a family, who had thus gro&s;&s;ly in&s;ulted
her.</P>
<P>While the&s;e con&s;iderations occupied
him, the emotion they occa&s;ioned did not
e&s;cape Ellena's ob&s;ervation; it encrea&s;ed,
as he reflected on the impo&s;&s;ibility of urg|ing
them to her, and on the hopele&s;sne&s;s
of prevailing with her, unle&s;s he could pro|duce
new arguments in his favour. His
unaffected di&s;tre&s;s awakened all her ten|derne&s;s
and gratitude; &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf
whether &s;he ought any longer to a&s;&s;ert
her own rights, when by doing &s;o, &s;he &s;a|crificed
the peace of him, who had incur|red
&s;o much danger for her &s;ake, who had
<PB N="145" REF="146">
re&s;cued her from &s;evere oppre&s;&s;ion, and had
&s;o long and &s;o well proved the &s;trength
of his affection.</P>
<P>As &s;he applied the&s;e que&s;tions, &s;he ap|peared
to her&s;elf an unju&s;t and &s;elfi&s;h be|ing,
unwilling to make any &s;acrifice for the
tranquillity of him, who had given her
liberty, even at the ri&s;k of his life. Her
very virtues, now that they were carried
to exce&s;s, &s;eemed to her to border upon
vices; her &s;en&s;e of dignity, appeared to be
narrow pride; her delicacy weakne&s;s; her
moderated affection cold ingratitude; and
her circum&s;pection, little le&s;s than pru|dence
degenerated into meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as apt in admitting hope as fear,
immediately perceived her re&s;olution be|ginning
to yield, and he urged again every
argument which was likely to prevail over
it. But the &s;ubject was too important
for Ellena, to be immediately decided
upon; he departed with only a faint a&s;|&s;urance
of encouragement; and &s;he for|bade
<PB N="146" REF="147">
him to return till the following day,
when &s;he would acquaint him with her
final determination.</P>
<P>This interval was, perhaps, the mo&s;t
painful he had ever experienced. Alone,
and on the banks of the lake, he pa&s;&s;ed
many hours in alternate hope and fear;
in endeavouring to anticipate the deci&s;ion,
on which &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended all his future
peace, and abruptly recoiling from it, as
often as imagination repre&s;ented it to be
adver&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the walls, that enclo&s;ed her, he
&s;carcely ever lo&s;t &s;ight; the view of them
&s;eemed to cheri&s;h his hopes, and, while he
gazed upon their rugged &s;urface, Ellena
alone was pictured on his fancy; till his
anxiety to learn her di&s;po&s;ition towards him
aro&s;e to agony, and he would abruptly leave
the &s;pot. But an invi&s;ible &s;pell &s;till &s;eemed
to attract him back again, and evening
found him pacing &s;lowly beneath the &s;hade
of tho&s;e melancholy boundaries that con|cealed
his Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
Her day was not more tranquil. When|ever
prudence and decorous pride forbade
her to become a member of the Vivaldi
family, as con&s;tantly did gratitude, affec|tion,
irre&s;i&s;tible tenderne&s;s plead the cau&s;e
of Vivaldi The memory of pa&s;t times re|turned;
and the very accents of the decea&s;|ed
&s;eemed to murmur from the grave, and
command her to fulfil the engagement,
which had &s;oothed the dying moments of
Bianchi.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Vivaldi was
at the gates of the convent, long before the
appointed hour, and he lingered in dreadful
impatience, till the clock &s;truck the &s;ignal
for his entrance.</P>
<P>Ellena was already in the parlour; &s;he
was alone, and ro&s;e in di&s;order on his ap|proach.
His &s;teps faultered, his voice was
lo&s;t, and his eyes only, which he fixed with
a wild earne&s;tne&s;s on her's, had power to
enquire her re&s;olution. She ob&s;erved the
palene&s;s of his countenance, and his emo|tion,
<PB N="148" REF="149">
with a mixture of concern and ap|probation.
At that moment, he perceived
her &s;mile, and hold out her hand to him;
and fear, care, and doubt vani&s;hed at once
from his mind. He was incapable of
thanking her, but &s;ighed deeply as he
pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, overcome with joy,
&s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t the grate that
&s;eparated them.</P>
<P>"You are, then, indeed my own!" &s;aid
Vivaldi, at length recovering his voice&mdash;"We
&s;hall be no more parted&mdash;you are
mine for ever! But your countenance
changes! O heaven! &s;urely I have not
mi&s;taken! Speak! I conjure you, Ellena;
relieve me from the&s;e terrible doubts!"</P>
<P>"I am yours, Vivaldi," replied Ellena
faintly, "oppre&s;&s;ion can part us no more."</P>
<P>She wept, and drew her veil over her
eyes.</P>
<P>"What mean tho&s;e tears?" &s;aid Vival|di,
with alarm. "Ah! Ellena," he added
in a &s;oftened voice, "&s;hould tears mingle
<PB N="149" REF="150">
with &s;uch moments as the&s;e! Should your
tears fall upon my heart now! They tell
me, that your con&s;ent is given with reluc|tance&mdash;with
grief; that your love is fee|ble,
your heart&mdash;yes Ellena! that your
whole heart is no longer mine!"</P>
<P>"They ought rather to tell you," re|plied
Ellena, "that it is all your own;
that my affection never was more powerful
than now, when it can overcome every
con&s;ideration with re&s;pect to your family,
and urge me to a &s;tep which mu&s;t degrade
me in their eyes,&mdash;and, I fear, in my own."</P>
<P>"O retract that cruel a&s;&s;ertion!" inter|rupted
Vivaldi, "Degrade you in your
own!&mdash;degrade you in their eyes!" He
was much agitated; his countenance was
flu&s;hed, and an air of more than u&s;ual
dignity dilated his figure.</P>
<P>"The time &s;hall come, my Ellena," he
added with energy, "when they &s;hall un|der&s;tand
your worth, and acknowledge
your excellence. O! that I were an Em|peror,
<PB N="150" REF="151">
that I might &s;hew to all the world
how much I love and honour you!"</P>
<P>Ellena gave him her hand, and, with|drawing
her veil, &s;miled on him through
her tears, with gratitude and reviving cou|rage.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi retired to the convent,
he obtained her con&s;ent to con&s;ult with an
aged Benedictine, whom he had engaged
in his intere&s;t, as to the hour at which the
marriage might be &s;olemnized with lea&s;t
ob&s;ervation. The prie&s;t informed him,
that at the conclu&s;ion of the ve&s;per-&s;ervice,
he &s;hould be di&s;engaged for &s;everal hours;
and that, as the fir&s;t hour after &s;un-&s;et was
more &s;olitary than almo&s;t any other, the
brotherhood being then a&s;&s;embled in the
refectory, he would meet Vivaldi and El|lena
at that time, in a chapel on the edge
of the lake, a &s;hort di&s;tance from the Bene|dictine
convent, to which it belonged,
and celebrate their nuptials.</P>
<P>With this propo&s;al, Vivaldi imme|diately
<PB N="151" REF="152">
returned to Ellena; when it was
agreed that the party &s;hould a&s;&s;emble at
the hour mentioned by the prie&s;t. Ellena,
who had thought it proper to mention her
intention to the Abbe&s;s of the Ur&s;alines,
was, by her permi&s;&s;ion, to be attended by a
lay-&s;i&s;ter; and Vivaldi was to meet her with|out
the walls, and conduct her to the al|tar.
When the ceremony was over, the
fugitives were to embark in a ve&s;&s;el, hired
for the purpo&s;e, and, cro&s;&s;ing the lake, pro|ceed
towards Naples. Vivaldi again with|drew
to engage a boat, and Ellena to
prepare for the continuance of her jour|ney.</P>
<P>As the appointed hour drew near, her
&s;pirits &s;unk, and &s;he watched with melan|choly
foreboding, the &s;un retiring amid&s;t
&s;tormy clouds, and his rays fading from the
highe&s;t points of the mountains, till the
gloom of twilight prevailed over the &s;cene.
She then left her apartment, took a
grateful leave of the ho&s;pitable Abbe&s;s,
<PB N="152" REF="153">
and, attended by the lay-&s;i&s;ter, quitted the
convent.</P>
<P>Immediately without the gate &s;he was
met by Vivaldi, who&s;e look, as he put her
arm within his, gently reproached her for
the dejection of her air.</P>
<P>They walked in &s;ilence towards the cha|pel
of San Seba&s;tian. The &s;cene appeared
to &s;ympathize with the &s;pirits of Ellena.
It was a gloomy evening, and the lake,
which broke in dark waves upon the &s;hore,
mingled its hollow &s;ounds with tho&s;e of
the wind, that bowed the lofty pines, and
&s;wept in gu&s;ts among the rocks. She ob|&s;erved
with alarm the heavy thunder
clouds, that rolled along the &s;ides of the
mountains, and the birds circling &s;wiftly
over the waters, and &s;cudding away to
their ne&s;ts among the cliffs; and the no|ticed
to Vivaldi, that, as a &s;torm &s;eemed
approaching, &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid cro&s;&s;ing
the lake. He immediately ordered Paulo
to di&s;mi&s;s the boat, and to be in waiting
<PB N="153" REF="154">
with a carriage, that, if the weather &s;hould
become clear, they might not be detained
longer than was otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As they approached the chapel, Ellena
fixed her eyes on the mournful cypre&s;&s;es
which waved over it, and &s;ighed. "Tho&s;e,"
&s;he &s;aid, "are funereal mementos&mdash;not
&s;uch as &s;hould grace the altar of marriage!
Vivaldi, I could be &s;upper&s;titious.&mdash;Think
you not they are portentous of future mis|fortune?
But forgive me; my &s;pirits are
weak."</P>
<P>Vivaldi endeavoured to &s;oothe her mind,
and tenderly reproached her for the &s;adne&s;s
&s;he indulged. Thus they entered the
chapel. Silence, and a kind of gloomy &s;e|pulchral
light, prevailed within. The ve|nerable
Benedictine, with a brother, who
was to &s;erve as guardian to the bride, were
already there, but they were kneeling, and
engaged in prayer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi led the trembling Ellena to the
altar, where they waited till the Benedic|tines
<PB N="154" REF="155">
&s;hould have fini&s;hed, and the&s;e were
moments of great emotion. She often
looked round the du&s;ky chapel, in fearful
expectation of di&s;covering &s;ome lurking
ob&s;erver; and, though &s;he knew it to be
very improbable, that any per&s;on in this
neighbourhood could be intere&s;ted in in|terrupting
the ceremony, her mind in|voluntarily
admitted the po&s;&s;ibility of it.
Once, indeed, as her eyes glanced over a
ca&s;ement, Ellena fancied she di&s;tingui&s;hed
a human face laid clo&s;e to the gla&s;s, as if to
watch what was pa&s;&s;ing within; but when
&s;he looked again, the apparition was gone.
Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he li&s;tened with
anxiety to the uncertain &s;ounds without,
and &s;ometimes &s;tarted as the &s;urges of the
lake da&s;hed over the rock below, almo&s;t
believing &s;he heard the &s;teps and whi&s;per|ing
voices of men in the avenues of the
chapel. She tried, however, to &s;ubdue
apprehen&s;ion, by con&s;idering, that if this
were true, an harmle&s;s curio&s;ity might
<PB N="155" REF="156">
have attracted &s;ome inhabitants of the
convent hither, and her &s;pirits became
more compo&s;ed, till &s;he ob&s;erved a door
open a little way, and a dark countenance
looking from behind it. In the next in|&s;tant
it retreated, and the door was clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who perceived Ellena's com|plexion
change, as &s;he laid her hand on
his arm, followed her eyes to the door, but,
no per&s;on appearing, he enquired the
cau&s;e of her alarm.</P>
<P>"We are ob&s;erved," &s;aid Ellena, "&s;ome
per&s;on appeared at that door!"</P>
<P>"And if we are ob&s;erved, my love," re|plied
Vivaldi, "who is there in this neigh|bourhood
who&s;e ob&s;ervation we can have
rea&s;on to fear? Good father, di&s;patch," he
added, turning to the prie&s;t, "you forget
that we are waiting."</P>
<P>The officiating prie&s;t made a &s;ignal that
he had nearly concluded his ori&s;on; but
the other brother ro&s;e immediately, and
&s;poke with Vivaldi, who de&s;ired that the
<PB N="156" REF="157">
doors of the chapel might be fa&s;tened to
prevent intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>"We dare not bar the gates of this holy
temple," replied the Benedictine, "it is a
&s;anctuary, and never may be clo&s;ed."</P>
<P>"But you will allow me to repre&s;s idle
curio&s;ity," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and to enquire
who watches beyond that door? The
tranquillity of this lady demands thus
much."</P>
<P>The brother a&s;&s;ented, and Vivaldi &s;tep|ped
to the door; but perceiving no per&s;on
in the ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age beyond it, he re|turned
with lighter &s;teps to the altar,
from which the officiating prie&s;t now
ro&s;e.</P>
<P>"My children," &s;aid he," I have made
you wait,&mdash;but an old man's prayers are
not le&s;s important than a young man's
vows, though this is not a moment when
you will admit that truth."</P>
<P>"I will allow whatever you plea&s;e,
good father," replied Vivaldi, "if you will
<PB N="157" REF="158">
admini&s;ter tho&s;e vows, without further
delay;&mdash;time pre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>The venerable prie&s;t took his &s;tation at
the altar, and opened the book. Vivaldi
placed him&s;elf on his right hand, and with
looks of anxious love, endeavoured to en|courage
Ellena, who, with a dejected coun|tenance,
which her veil but ill concealed,
and eyes fixed on the ground, leaned on
her attendant &s;i&s;ter. The figure and home|ly
features of this &s;i&s;ter; the tall &s;tature
and har&s;h vi&s;age of the brother, clothed in
the gray habit of his order; the &s;ilvered
head and placid phy&s;iognomy of the offici|ating
prie&s;t, enlightened by a gleam from
the lamp above, oppo&s;ed to the youthful
grace and &s;pirit of Vivaldi, and the milder
beauty and &s;weetne&s;s of Ellena, formed
altogether a group worthy of the pencil.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t had begun the ceremony, when
a noi&s;e from without again alarmed Elle|na,
who ob&s;erved the door once more cau|tiou&s;ly
opened, and a man bend forward his
<PB N="158" REF="159">
gigantic figure from behind it. He car|ried
a torch, and its glare, as the door gra|dually
unclo&s;ed, di&s;covered other per&s;ons
in the pa&s;&s;age beyond, looking forward
over his &s;houlder into the chapel. The
fiercene&s;s of their air, and the &s;trange pe|culiarity
of their dre&s;s, in&s;tantly convinced
Ellena that they were not inhabitants of
the Benedictine convent, but &s;ome terrible
me&s;&s;engers of evil, Her half-&s;tifled &s;hriek
alarmed Vivaldi, who caught her before
&s;he fell to the ground; but, as he had not
faced the door, he did not under&s;tand the
occa&s;ion of her terror, till the &s;udden ru&s;h
of foot&s;teps made him turn, when he ob|&s;erved
&s;everal men armed, and very &s;in|gularly
habited, advancing towards the
altar.</P>
<P>"Who is he that intrudes upon this
&s;anctuary?" he demanded &s;ternly, while he
half ro&s;e from the ground where Ellena
had &s;unk.</P>
<P>"What &s;acrilegious foot&s;teps," cried
<PB N="159" REF="160">
the prie&s;t "thus rudely violate this holy
placed?"</P>
<P>Ellena was now in&s;en&s;ible; and the men|continuing
to advance, Vivaldi drew his
&s;word to protect her.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t and Vivaldi now &s;poke toge|ther,
but the words of neither could be
di&s;tingui&s;hed, when a voice, tremendous
from its loudne&s;s; like bur&s;ting thunder,
di&s;&s;ipated the cloud of my&s;tery.</P>
<P>"You Vincentio di Vivaldi, and of Na|ples;"
it &s;aid, "and you Ellena di Ro&s;al|ba,
of Villa Altieri, we &s;ummon you to &s;ur|render,
in the name of the mo&s;t holy In|qui&s;ition!"</P>
<P>"The Inqui&s;ition!" exclaimed Vivaldi,
&s;carcely believing what he heard. "Here
is &s;ome mi&s;take!"</P>
<P>The official repeated the &s;ummons,
without deigning to reply.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, yet more a&s;toni&s;hed, added,
"Do not imagine you can &s;o far impo&s;e
upon my credulity, as that I can believe
<PB N="160" REF="161">
my&s;elf to have fallen within the cognizance
of the Inqui&s;ition."</P>
<P>"You may believe what you plea&s;e,
Signor," replied the chief officer, "but you
and that lady are our pri&s;oners."</P>
<P>"Begone, impo&s;tor!" &s;aid Vivaldi,
&s;pringing from the ground, where he had
&s;upported Ellena," or my &s;word &s;hall teach
you to repent your audacity!"</P>
<P>"Do you in&s;ult an officer of the Inqui|&s;ition!"
exclaimed the ruffian. "That
holy Community will inform you what
you incur by re&s;i&s;ting it's mandate."</P>
<P>The prie&s;t interrupted Vivaldi's retort,
"If you are really officers of that tremen|dous
tribunal," he &s;aid, "produce &s;ome
proof of your office. Remember this place
is &s;anctified, and tremble for the con&s;e|quence
of impo&s;ition. You do wrong to
believe, that I will deliver up to you per|&s;ons
who have taken refuge here, with|out
an unequivocal demand from that
dread power."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
"Produce your form of &s;ummons,"
demanded Vivaldi, with haughty impa|tience.</P>
<P>"It is here," replied the official, draw|ing
forth a black &s;croll, which he deli|vered
to the prie&s;t, "Read, and be &s;atis|fied!"</P>
<P>The Benedictine &s;tarted the in&s;tant he
beheld the &s;croll, but he received and de|liberately
examined it. The kind of parch|ment,
the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;eal, the par|ticular
form of words, the private &s;ignals,
under&s;tood only by the initiated&mdash;all an|nounced
this to be a true in&s;trument of ar|re&s;tation
from the <HI>Holy Office.</HI> The &s;croll
dropped from his hand, and he fixed his
eyes, with &s;urprize and unutterable com|pa&s;&s;ion,
upon Vivaldi, who &s;tooped to
reach the parchment, when it was &s;natch|ed
by the official.</P>
<P>"Unhappy young man!" &s;aid the prie&s;t,
"it is too true; you are &s;ummoned by
that awful power, to an&s;wer to your crime,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
and I am &s;pared from the commi&s;&s;ion of a
terrible offence!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi appeared thunder&s;truck. "For
what crime, holy father, am I called upon
to an&s;wer? This is &s;ome bold and artful
impo&s;ture, &s;ince it can delude even you!
What crime&mdash;what offence?"</P>
<P>"I did not think you had been thus
hardened in guilt!" replied the prie&s;t,
"Forbear! add not the audacity of falfe|hood,
to the headlong, pa&s;&s;ions of youth.
You under&s;tand too well your crime,"</P>
<P>"Fal&s;ehood!" retorted Vivaldi, "But
your years, old man, and tho&s;e &s;acred ve&s;t|ments,
protect you. For the&s;e ruffians,
who have dared to implicate that inno|cent
victim," pointing to Ellena, "in the
charge, they &s;hall have ju&s;tice from my
vengeance."</P>
<P>"Forbear! forbear!" &s;aid the prie&s;t,
&s;eizing his arm, "have pity on your&s;elf
and on her. Know you not the puni&s;h|ment
you incur from re&s;i&s;tance.?"</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164">
"I know nor care not," replied Vivaldi,
"but I will defend Ellena di Ro&s;alba to
the la&s;t moment. Let them approach if
they dare."</P>
<P>"It is on her, on her who lies &s;en&s;ele&s;s
at your feet," &s;aid the prie&s;t, "that they
will wreck their vengeance for the&s;e in|&s;ults;
on her&mdash;the partner of your guilt."</P>
<P>"The partner of my guilt!" exclaimed
Vivaldi, with mingled a&s;toni&s;hment and
indignation&mdash;"of my guilt!"</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h young man! does not the very
veil &s;he wears betray it? I marvel how it
could pa&s;s my ob&s;ervation!"</P>
<P>"You have &s;tolen a nun from her con|vent,"
&s;aid the chief officer, "and mu&s;t
an&s;wer for the crime. When you have
wearied your&s;elf with the&s;e heroics, Signor,
you mu&s;t go with us; our patience is
wearied already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi ob&s;erved, for the fir&s;t time, that
Ellena was &s;hrouded in a nun's veil; it
was the one which Olivia had lent, to con|ceal
<PB N="164" REF="165">
her from the notice of the Abbe&s;s,
on the night of her departure from San
Stefano, and which, in the hurry of that
departure, &s;he had forgotten to leave with
the nun. During this interval, her mind
had been too entirely occupied by cares
and apprehen&s;ion to allow her once to no|tice,
that the veil &s;he wore was other than
her u&s;ual one; but it had been too well
ob&s;erved by &s;ome of the Ur&s;aline &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Though he knew not how to account
for the circum&s;tance of the veil, Vivaldi
began to perceive others which gave co|lour
to the charge brought again&s;t him,
and to a&s;certain the wide circumference of
the &s;nare that was &s;pread around him.
He fancied, too, that he perceived the
hand of Schedoni employed upon it, and
that his dark &s;pirit was now avenging it|&s;elf
for the expo&s;ure he had &s;uffered in the
church of the Spirito Santo, and for all the
con&s;equent: mortifications. As Vivaldi
was ignorant of the ambitious hopes which
<PB N="165" REF="166">
the Marche&s;a had encouraged in father
Schedoni, he did not &s;ee the improbabili|ty,
that the Confe&s;&s;or would have dared to
hazard her favour by this arre&s;t of her &s;on;
much le&s;s could he &s;u&s;pect, that Schedoni,
having done &s;o, had &s;ecrets in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
which enabled him &s;afely to defy her
re&s;entment, and bind her in &s;ilence to his
decree.</P>
<P>With the conviction, that Schedoni's
was the ma&s;ter-hand that directed the pre|&s;ent
manoeuvre, Vivaldi &s;tood agha&s;t, and
gazing in &s;ilent unutterable angui&s;h on El|lena,
who, as &s;he began to revive, &s;tretched
forth her helple&s;s hands, and called upon
him to &s;ave her, "Do not leave me," &s;aid
&s;he in accents the mo&s;t &s;upplicating, "I
am &s;afe while you are with me."</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of her voice, he &s;tarted
from his trance, and turning fiercely
upon the ruffians, who &s;tood in &s;ullen
watchfulne&s;s around, bade them depart,
or prepare for his fury. At the &s;ame in|&s;tant
<PB N="166" REF="167">
they all drew their &s;words, and the
&s;hrieks of Ellena, and the &s;upplications of
the officiating prie&s;t, were lo&s;t amid&s;t the
tumult of the combatants.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, mo&s;t unwilling to &s;hed blood,
&s;tood merely on the defen&s;ive, till the vio|lence
of his antagoni&s;ts compelled him to
exert all his &s;kill and &s;trength. He then
di&s;abled one of the ruffians; but his &s;kill
was in&s;ufficient to repel the other two, and
he was nearly overcome, when &s;teps were
heard approaching, and Paulo ru&s;hed into
the chapel. Perceiving his ma&s;ter be&s;et,
he drew his &s;word, and came furiou&s;ly to
his aid. He fought with unconquerable
audacity and fiercene&s;s, till nearly at the
moment when his adver&s;ary fell, other ruf|fians
entered the chapel, and Vivaldi with
his faithful &s;ervant was wounded, and, at
length, di&s;armed.</P>
<P>Ellena, who had been withheld from
throwing her&s;elf between the combatants,
now, on ob&s;erving that Vivaldi was wound|ed,
<PB N="167" REF="168">
renewed her efforts for liberty, accom|panied
by &s;uch agony of &s;upplication and
complaint, as almo&s;t moved to pity the
hearts of the &s;urrounding ruffians.</P>
<P>Di&s;abled by his wounds, and al&s;o held
by his enemies, Vivaldi was compelled to
witne&s;s her di&s;tre&s;s and danger, without a
hope of re&s;cuing her. In frantic accents
he called upon the old prie&s;t to protect
her.</P>
<P>"I dare not oppo&s;e the orders of the In|qui&s;ition,"
replied the Benedictine, "even
if I had &s;ufficient &s;trength to defy it's offi|cials.
Know you not, unhappy young
man, that it is death to re&s;i&s;t them?"</P>
<P>"Death!" exclaimed Ellena, "death!"</P>
<P>"Ay lady, too &s;urely &s;o!"</P>
<P>"Signor, it would have been well for
you," &s;aid one of the officers, "if you had
taken my advice; you will pay dearly for
what you have done," pointing to the ruffian,
who lay &s;everely wounded on the
ground.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">
"My ma&s;ter will not have that to pay
for, friend," &s;aid Paulo, "for if you mu&s;t
know, that is a piece of my work; and, if
my arms were now at liberty, I would try
if I could not match it among one of you,
though I am &s;o &s;la&s;hed."</P>
<P>"Peace, good Paulo! the deed was
mine," &s;aid Vivaldi; then addre&s;&s;ing the
official, "For my&s;elf I care not, I have
done my duty&mdash;but for her!&mdash;Can you
look upon her, innocent and helple&s;s as
&s;he is, and not relent! Can you, will you,
barbarians! drag her, al&s;o, to de&s;truc|tion,
upon a charge too &s;o daringly
fal&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Our relenting would be of no &s;ervice
to her," replied the official, "we mu&s;t do
our duty. Whether the charge is true or
fal&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t an&s;wer to it before her
judges."</P>
<P>"What charge?" demanded Ellena.</P>
<P>"The charge of having broken your
nun's vows," replied the prie&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
Ellena rai&s;ed her eyes to heaven "Is it
even &s;o!" &s;he exclaimed.</P>
<P>"You hear &s;he acknowledges the
crime," &s;aid one of the ruffians.</P>
<P>"She acknowledges no crime," replied
Vivaldi; "&s;he only perceives the extent of
the malice that per&s;ecutes her. O! El|lena,
mu&s;t I then abandon you to their
power! leave you for ever!"</P>
<P>The agony of this thought re-animated
him with momentary &s;trength; he bur&s;t
from the gra&s;p of the officials, and once
more cla&s;ped Ellena to his bo&s;om, who,
unable to &s;peak, wept, with the angui&s;h of
a breaking heart, as her head &s;unk upon
his &s;houlder. The ruffians around them
&s;o far re&s;pected their grief, that, for a mo|ment,
they did not interrupt it.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's exertion was tran&s;ient; faint
from &s;orrow, and from lo&s;s of blood, he
became unable to &s;upport him&s;elf, and was
compelled again to relinqui&s;h Ellena.</P>
<P>"Is there no help?" &s;aid &s;he, with
<PB N="170" REF="171">
agony; "will you &s;uffer him to expire on
the ground?"</P>
<P>The prie&s;t directed, that he &s;hould be
conveyed to the Benedictine convent,
where his wounds might be examined,
and medical aid admini&s;tered. The di&s;|abled
ruffians were already carried thither;
but Vivaldi refu&s;ed to go, unle&s;s Ellena
might accompany him. It was contrary
to the rules of the place, that a woman
&s;hould enter it, and before the prie&s;t could
reply, his Benedictine brother eagerly &s;aid,
that they dared not tran&s;gre&s;s the law of
the convent.</P>
<P>Ellena's fears for Vivaldi entirely over|came
tho&s;e for her&s;elf, and &s;he entreated,
that he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be con|veyed
to the Benedictines; but he could
not be prevailed with to leave her. The
officials, however, prepared to &s;eparate
them; Vivaldi in vain urged the u&s;ele&s;s
cruelty of dividing him from Ellena, if, as
they had hinted, &s;he al&s;o was to be carried
<PB N="171" REF="172">
to the Inqui&s;ition; and as ineffectually de|manded,
whither they really de&s;igned to
take her.</P>
<P>"We &s;hall take good care of her, Signor,"
&s;aid an officer, "that is &s;ufficient for you.
It &s;ignifies nothing whether you are go|ing
the &s;ame way, you mull not go toge|ther."</P>
<P>"Why, did you ever hear, Signor, of
arre&s;ted per&s;ons being &s;uffered to remain
in company?" &s;aid another ruffian, "Fine
plots they would lay; I warrant they
would not contradict each other's evidence
a tittle."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not &s;eparate me from my
ma&s;ter, though," vociferated Paulo; "I
demand to be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition with
him, or to the devil, but all is one for
that."</P>
<P>"Fair and &s;oftly," replied the officer;
"you &s;hall be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition fir&s;t,
and to the devil afterwards; you mu&s;t be
tried before you are condemned."</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">
"But wa&s;te no more time," he added
to his followers, and pointing to Ellena,
"away with her."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, they lifted Ellena in
their arms. "Let me loo&s;e!" cried Pau|lo,
when he &s;aw they were carrying her
from the place, "let me loo&s;e, I &s;ay!" and
the violence of his &s;truggles bur&s;t a&s;under
the cords which held him; a vain relea&s;e,
for he was in&s;tantly &s;eized again.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, already exhau&s;ted by the lo&s;s
of blood and the angui&s;h of his mind,
made, however, a la&s;t effort to &s;ave her;
he tried to rai&s;e him&s;elf from the ground,
but a &s;udden film came over his &s;ight, and
his &s;en&s;es for&s;ook him, while yet the name
of Ellena faultered on his lips.</P>
<P>As they bore her from the chapel,
&s;he continued to call upon Vivaldi, and
alternately co &s;upplicate that &s;he might
once more behold him, and take one la&s;t
adieu. The ruffians were inexorable, and
&s;he heard his voice no more, for he no
<PB N="173" REF="174">
longer heard&mdash;no longer was able to reply
to her's.</P>
<P>"O! once again!" &s;he cried in agony,
"One word, Vivaldi! Let me hear the
&s;ound of your voice yet once again!"
But it was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>As &s;he quitted the chapel, with eyes
&s;till bent towards the &s;pot where he lay,
&s;he exclaimed, in the piercing accents of
de&s;pair, "Farewell, Vivaldi!&mdash;O! for ever
&mdash;ever, farewel!"</P>
<P>The tone, in which &s;he pronounced the
la&s;t "farewel!" was &s;o touching, that even
the cold heart of the prie&s;t could not re&s;i&s;t
it; but he impatiently wiped away the few
tears, that ru&s;hed into his eyes, before they
were ob&s;erved. Vivaldi heard it&mdash;it &s;eem|ed
to arou&s;e him from death!&mdash;he heard
her mournful voice for the la&s;t time, and,
turning his eyes, &s;aw her veil floating away
through the portal of the chapel. All
&s;uffering, all effort, all re&s;i&s;tance were vain;
the ruffians bound him, bleeding as he
<PB N="174" REF="175">
was, and conveyed him to the Benedictine
convent, together with the wounded Pau|lo,
who uncea&s;ingly vociferated on the way
thither, "I demand to be &s;ent to the In|qui&s;ion!
I demand to be &s;ent to the In|qui&s;ition!"</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE wounds of Vivaldi, and of his &s;er|vant,
were pronounced, by the Benedic|tine
who had examined and dre&s;&s;ed them,
to be not dangerous, but tho&s;e of one of
the ruffians were declared doubtful. Some
few of the brothers di&s;played much com|pa&s;&s;ion
and kindne&s;s towards the pri&s;on|ers;
<PB N="175" REF="176">
but the greater part &s;eemed fearful of
expre&s;&s;ing any degree of &s;ympathy for
per&s;ons who had fallen within the cogni|zance
of the Holy Office, and even kept
aloof from the chamber, in which they were
confined. To this &s;elf-re&s;triction, how|ever,
they were not long &s;ubjected; for
Vivaldi and Paulo were compelled to be|gin
their journey as &s;oon as &s;ome &s;hort re&s;t
had &s;ufficiently revived them. They were
placed in the &s;ame carriage, but the pre|&s;ence
of two officers prevented all inter|change
of conjecture as to the de&s;tination
of Ellena, and with re&s;pect to the imme|diate
occa&s;ion of their misfortune. Paulo,
indeed, now and then hazarded a &s;urmi&s;e,
and did not &s;cruple to affirm, that the Ab|be&s;s
of San Stefano was their chief enemy;
that the Carmelite friars, who had over|taken
them on the road, were her agents;
and that, having traced their route, they
had given intelligence where Vivaldi and
Ellena might be found.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177">
"I gue&s;&s;ed we never &s;hould e&s;cape the
Abbe&s;s," &s;aid Paulo, "though I would not
di&s;turb you, Signor mio, nor the poor lady
Ellena, by &s;aying &s;o. But your Abbe&s;&s;es
are as cunning as Inqui&s;itors, and are &s;o
fond of governing, that they had rather,
like them, &s;end a man to the devil, than
&s;end him no where."</P>
<P>Vivaldi gave Paulo a &s;ignificant look,
which was meant to repre&s;s his imprudent
loquacity, and then &s;unk again into &s;ilence
and the ab&s;tractions of deep grief. The offi|cers,
mean while, never &s;poke, but were ob|&s;ervant
of all that Paulo &s;aid, who per|ceived
their watchfulne&s;s, but becau&s;e he
de&s;pi&s;ed them as &s;pies, he thoughtle&s;sly de|&s;pi&s;ed
them al&s;o as enemies, and was &s;o far"
from concealing opinions, which they
might repeat to his prejudice, that he had
a pride in exaggerating them, and in dar|ing
the wor&s;t, which the exa&s;perated tem|pers
of the&s;e men, &s;hut up in the &s;ame
carriage with him, and compelled to hear
<PB N="177" REF="178">
whatever he cho&s;e to &s;ay again&s;t the in&s;ti|tution
to which they belonged, could
effect. Whenever Vivaldi, recalled from
his ab&s;tractions by &s;ome bold a&s;&s;ertion,
endeavoured to check his imprudence,
Paulo was contented to &s;olace his con|&s;cience,
in&s;tead of protecting him&s;elf, by
&s;aying, "It is their own fault; they would
thru&s;t them&s;elves into my company; let
them have enough of it; and, if ever they
take me before their reverences, the Inqui|&s;itors,
<HI>they</HI> &s;hall have enough for it too.
I will play up &s;uch a tune in the Inqui&s;i|tion
as is not heard there every day.
I will jingle all the bells on their fool's
caps, and tell them a little hone&s;t truth, if
they make me &s;mart for it ever &s;o."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, arou&s;ed once more, and &s;eriou&s;|ly
alarmed for the con&s;equences which ho|ne&s;t
Paulo might be drawing upon him|&s;elf,
now in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;ilence, and was
obeyed.</P>
<P>They travelled during the whole night,
&s;topping only to change hor&s;es. At
<PB N="178" REF="179">
every po&s;t hou&s;e, Vivaldi looked for a car|riage
that might inclo&s;e Ellena, but none
appeared, nor any &s;ound of wheels told
him that &s;he followed.</P>
<P>With the morning light he perceived
the dome of St. Peter, appearing faintly
over the plains that &s;urrounded Rome, and
he under&s;tood, for the fir&s;t time, that he
was going to the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition
in that city. The travellers de&s;cended
upon the Campania, and then re&s;ted for
a few hours at a &s;mall town on its borders.</P>
<P>When they again &s;et forward, Vivaldi
perceived that the guard was changed, the
officer who had remained with him in the
apartment of the inn only appearing
among the new faces which &s;urrounded
him. The dre&s;s and manners of the&s;e men
differed con&s;iderably from tho&s;e of the
other. Their conduct was more temper|rate,
but their countenances expre&s;&s;ed a
darker cruelty, mingled with a &s;ly demure|ne&s;s,
and a &s;olemn &s;elf-importance, that an|nounced
them at once as belonging to the
<PB N="179" REF="180">
Inqui&s;ition. They were almo&s;t invariably
&s;ilent; and when they did &s;peak, it was
only in a few &s;ententious words. To the
abounding que&s;tions of Paulo, and the few
earne&s;t entreaties of his ma&s;ter, to be in|formed
of the place of Ellena's de&s;tination,
they made not the lea&s;t reply; and li&s;ten|ed
to all the flouri&s;hing &s;peeches of the
&s;ervant again&s;t Inqui&s;itors and the Holy
Office with the mo&s;t profound gravity.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;truck with the circum|&s;tance
of the guard being changed, and
&s;till more with the appearance of the par|ty,
who now compo&s;ed it. When he com|pared
the manners of the late, with tho&s;e
of the pre&s;ent guard, he thought he di&s;co|vered
in the fir&s;t the mere ferocity of ru&s;|&s;ians;
but in the latter, the principles of
cunning and cruelty, which &s;eemed parti|cularly
to characterize Inqui&s;itors; he was
inclined to believe, that a &s;tratagem had
enthralled him, and that now, for the fir&s;t
time, he was in the cu&s;tody of the <HI>Holy
Office.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">
It was near midnight when the pri&s;oners
entered the <HI>Porto del Popolo,</HI> and found
them&s;elves in the mid&s;t of the Carnival at
Rome. The <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> through which they
were obliged to pa&s;s, was crowded with gay
carriages and ma&s;ks, with proce&s;&s;ions of
mu&s;icians, monks, and mountebanks, was
lighted up with innumerable flambeaux,
and re&s;ounded with the heterogeneous
rattling of wheels, the mu&s;ic of &s;erenaders,
and the jokes and laughter of the revel|lers,
as they &s;portively threw about their
&s;ugar-plumbs. The heat of the weather
made it nece&s;&s;ary to have the windows of
the coach open; and the pri&s;oners, there|fore,
&s;aw all that pa&s;&s;ed without. It was
a &s;cene, which contra&s;ted cruelly with the
feelings and circum&s;tances of Vivaldi;
torn as he was from her he mo&s;t loved, in
dreadful uncertainty as to her fate, and
him&s;elf about to be brought before a tri|bunal,
who&s;e my&s;terious and terrible pro|ceedings
appalled even the brave&s;t &s;pirits.
<PB N="181" REF="182">
Altogether, this was one of the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing
examples, which the chequer-work of
human life could &s;hew, or human feelings
endure, Vivaldi &s;ickened as he looked upon
the &s;plendid crowd, while the carriage
made its way &s;lowly with it; but Paulo,
as he gazed, was reminded of the Cor&s;o of
Naples, &s;uch as it appeared at the time of
Carnival, and, comparing the pre&s;ent &s;cene
with his native one, he found fault with
every thing he beheld. The dre&s;&s;es were
ta&s;tele&s;&s;, the equipages without &s;plendor,
the people without &s;pirit; yet, &s;uch was
the propen&s;ity of his heart to &s;ympathize
with whatever was gay, that, for &s;ome mo|ments,
he forgot that he was a pri&s;oner on
his way to the Inqui&s;ition; almo&s;t forgot
that he was a Neapolitan; and, while he
exclaimed again&s;t the dullne&s;s of a Roman
carnival, would have &s;prung through the
carriage window to partake of its &s;pirit, if
his fetters and his wounds had not with|held
him. A deep &s;igh from Vivaldi re|called
<PB N="182" REF="183">
his wandering imagination; and,
when he noticed again the &s;orrow in his
ma&s;ter's look, all his lightly joyous &s;pirits
fled.</P>
<P>"My <HI>mae&s;tro,</HI> my dear <HI>mae&s;tro!"</HI>&mdash;he
&s;aid, and knew not how to fini&s;h what he
wi&s;hed to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>At that moment they pa&s;&s;ed the theatre
of San Carlo, the doors of which were
thronged with equipages, where Roman
ladies, in their gala habits, courtiers in
their fanta&s;tic dre&s;&s;es, and ma&s;ks of all de|&s;criptions,
were ha&s;tening to the opera. In
the mid&s;t of this gay bu&s;tle, where the car|riage
was unable to proceed, the officials
of the Inqui&s;ition looked on in &s;olemn
&s;ilence, not a mu&s;cle of their features re|laxing
in &s;ympathy, or yielding a &s;ingle
wrinkle of the &s;elf-importance that lifted
their brows; and, while they regarded
with &s;ecret contempt tho&s;e, who could be
thus lightly plea&s;ed, the people, in return,
more wi&s;ely, perhaps, regarded with con|tempt
<PB N="183" REF="184">
the proud moro&s;ene&s;s, that refu&s;ed
to partake of innocent plea&s;ures, becau&s;e
they were trifling, and &s;hrunk from coun|tenances
&s;urrowed with the &s;ternne&s;s of
cruelty. But, when their office was dis|tingui&s;hed,
part of the crowd pre&s;&s;ed back
from the carriage in affright, while ano|ther
part advanced with curio&s;ity; though,
as the majority retreated, &s;pace was left
for the carriage to move on. After quit|ting
the Cor&s;o, it proceeded for &s;ome
miles through dark and de&s;erted &s;treets,
where only here and there a lamp, hung on
high before the image of a &s;aint, &s;hed it's
glimmering light, and where a melancholy
and univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed. At inter|vals,
indeed, the moon, as the clouds pa&s;&s;|ed,
away, &s;hewed, for a moment, &s;ome of
tho&s;e mighty monuments of Rome's eter|nal
name, tho&s;e &s;acred ruins, tho&s;e gigan|tic
&s;keletons, which once enclo&s;ed a &s;oul,
who&s;e energies governed a world! Even Vi|valdi
could not behold with indifference the
<PB N="184" REF="185">
grandeur of the&s;e reliques, as the rays fell
upon the hoary walls and columns, or
pa&s;s among the&s;e &s;cenes of ancient &s;tory,
without feeling a melancholy awe, a &s;a|cred
enthu&s;ia&s;m, that withdrew him from
him&s;elf. But the illu&s;ion was tran&s;ient;
his own misfortunes pre&s;&s;ed too heavily
upon him to be long unfelt, and his eh|thu&s;ia&s;m
vani&s;hed like the moonlight.</P>
<P>A returning gleam lighted up, &s;oon after,
the rude and exten&s;ive area, which the car|riage
was cro&s;&s;ing. It appeared, from it's
de&s;olation, and the ruins &s;cattered di&s;tant|ly
along its &s;kirts, to be a part of the city
entirely abandoned by the modern inhabi|tants
to the reliques of its former grandeur.
Not even the &s;hadow of a human being
cro&s;&s;ed the wa&s;te, nor any building appear|ed,
which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;helter
one. The deep tone of a bell, however,
rolling on the &s;ilence of the night, an|nounced
the haunts of man to be not far
off; and Vivaldi perceived in the di&s;tance,
<PB N="185" REF="186">
to which he was approaching, an extent of
lofty walls and towers, that, as far as the
gloom would permit his eye to penetrate,
bounded the horizon. He judged the&s;e
to be the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition. Pau|lo
pointed them out at the &s;ame moment.
"Ah, Signor!" &s;aid he de&s;pondingly; "that
is the place! what &s;trength! If, my Lord,
the Marche&s;e were but to &s;ee where we
are going! Ah!"&mdash;</P>
<P>He concluded with a deep &s;igh, and
&s;unk again into the &s;tate of apprehen&s;ion
and mute expectation, which he had &s;uf|fered
from the moment that he quitted the
Cor&s;o.</P>
<P>The carriage having reached the walls,
followed their bendings to a con&s;iderable
extent. The&s;e walls, of immen&s;e height,
and &s;trengthened by innumerable ma&s;&s;y
bulwarks, exhibited neither window or
grate, but a va&s;t and dreary blank; a
&s;mall round tower only, perched here and
there upon the &s;ummit, breaking their
monotony.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
The pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed what &s;eemed to be
the principal entrance, from, the grandeur
of its portal, and the gigantic loftine&s;s of
the towers that ro&s;e over it; and &s;oon af|ter
the carriage &s;topped at an arch-way in
the walls, &s;trongly barricadoed. One of
the e&s;cort alighted, and, having &s;truck up|on
the bars, a folding door within was im|mediately
opened, and a man bearing a
torch appeared behind the barricado,
who&s;e countenance, as he looked through
it, might have been copied for the
"Grim-vi&s;aged comfortle&s;s De&s;pair"
of the Poet.</P>
<P>No words were exchanged between him
and the guard; but on perceiving who
were without, he opened the iron gate,
and the pri&s;oners, having alighted, pa&s;&s;ed
with the two officials beneath the arch,
the guard following with a torch. They
de&s;cended a flight of broad &s;teps, at the
foot of which another iron gate admitted
them to a kind of hall; &s;uch, however, it
<PB N="187" REF="188">
at fir&s;t appeared to Vivaldi, as his eyes
glanced through its gloomy extent, im|perfectly
a&s;certaining it by the lamp, which
hung from the centre of the roof. No
per&s;on appeared, and a death-like &s;ilence
prevailed; for neither the officials nor the
guard yet &s;poke; nor did any di&s;tant
found contradict the notion, that they were
traver&s;ing the chambers of the dead. To
Vivaldi it occurred, that this was one of
the burial vaults of the victims, who &s;uf|fered
in the Inqui&s;ition, and his whole
frame thrilled with horror. Several ave|nues,
opening from the apartment, &s;eemed
to lead to di&s;tant quarters of this immen&s;e
fabric, but &s;till no foot&s;tep whi&s;pering
along the pavement, or voice murmuring
through the arched roofs, indicated it to
be the re&s;idence of the living.</P>
<P>Having entered one of the pa&s;&s;ages,
Vivaldi perceived a per&s;on clothed in black,
and who bore a lighted taper, cro&s;&s;ing &s;i|lently
in the remote per&s;pective; and he
<PB N="188" REF="189">
under&s;tood too well from his habit, that
he was a member of this dreadful tribunal.</P>
<P>The found of foot&s;teps &s;eemed to reach
the &s;tranger, for he turned, and then
pau&s;ed, while the officers advanced. They
then made &s;igns to each other, and ex|changed
a few words, which neither Vi|valdi
or his &s;ervant could under&s;tand,
when the &s;tranger, pointing with his taper
along another avenue, pa&s;&s;ed away. Vi|valdi
followed him with his eyes, till a door
at the extremity of the pa&s;&s;age opened,
and he &s;aw the Inqui&s;itor enter an apart|ment,
whence a great light proceeded, and
where &s;everal other figures, habited like
him&s;elf, appeared waiting to receive him.
The door immediately clo&s;ed; and, whe|ther
the imagination of Vivaldi was af|fected,
or that the &s;ounds were real, he
thought, as it clo&s;ed, he di&s;tingui&s;hed
half-&s;tifled groans, as of a per&s;on in agony.</P>
<P>The avenue, through which the pri|&s;oners
pa&s;&s;ed, opened, at length, into an
<PB N="189" REF="190">
ment gloomy like the fir&s;t they had enter|ed,
but more exten&s;ive. The roof was
&s;upported by arches, and long arcades
branched off from every &s;ide of the cham|ber,
as from a central point, and were lo&s;t
in the gloom, which the rays of the &s;mall
lamps, &s;u&s;pended in each, but feebly pe|netrated.</P>
<P>They re&s;ted here, and a per&s;on &s;oon af|ter
advanced, who appeared to be the jai|lor,
into who&s;e hands Vivaldi and Paulo
were delivered. A few my&s;terious words
having been exchanged, one of the officials
cro&s;&s;ed the hall, and a&s;cended a wide &s;tair|ca&s;e,
while the other, with the jailor and
the guard, remained below, as if awaiting
his return.</P>
<P>A long interval elap&s;ed, during which
the &s;tillne&s;s of the place was &s;ometimes
interrupted by a clo&s;ing door, and, at
others, by indi&s;tinct &s;ounds, which yet
appeared to Vivaldi like lamentations and
extorted groans. Inqui&s;itors, in their long
<PB N="190" REF="191">
black robes, i&s;&s;ued, from time, to time from
the pa&s;&s;ages, and cro&s;&s;ed the hall to other
avenues. They eyed the pri&s;oners with
curio&s;ity, but without pity. Their vi&s;ages,
with few exceptions, &s;eemed &s;tamped with
the characters of demons. Vivaldi could
not look upon the grave cruelty, or the
ferocious impatience, their countenances
&s;everally expre&s;&s;ed, without reading in
them the fate of &s;ome fellow creature,
the fate, which the&s;e men &s;eemed going,
even at this moment, to confirm; and, as
they pa&s;&s;ed with &s;oundle&s;s &s;teps, he &s;hrunk
from ob&s;ervation, as if their very looks
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;upernatural power, and
could have &s;truck death. But he followed
their fleeting figures, as they proceeded on
their work of horror, to where the la&s;t
glimmering ray faded into darkne&s;s, ex|pecting
to &s;ee other doors of other cham|bers
open to receive them. While medi|tating
upon the&s;e horrors, Vivaldi lo&s;t
every &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration in a&s;toni&s;hment
<PB N="191" REF="192">
and indignation of the &s;ufferings, which
the frenzied wickedne&s;s of man prepares
for man, who, even at the moment of in|fliction,
in&s;ults his victim with a&s;&s;ertions of
the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch procedure.
"Is this po&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid Vivaldi internally,
"Can this be in human nature!&mdash;Can
&s;uch horrible perver&s;ion of right be per|mitted!
Can man, who calls him&s;elf en|dowed
with rea&s;on, and immea&s;urably &s;u|perior
to every other created being, argue
him&s;elf into the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch horri|ble
folly, &s;uch inveterate cruelty, as exceeds
all the acts of the mo&s;t irrational and fero|cious
brute. Brutes do not deliberately
&s;laughter their &s;pecies; it remains for man
only, man, proud of his prerogative of rea|&s;on,
and boa&s;ting of his &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice,
to unite the mo&s;t terrible extremes of folly
and wickedne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi had been no &s;tranger to the ex|i&s;tence
of this tribunal; he had long un|der&s;tood
the nature of the e&s;tabli&s;hment,
<PB N="192" REF="193">
and had often received particular accounts
of its cu&s;toms and laws; but, though he
had believed before, it was now only that
conviction appeared to impre&s;e his under|&s;tanding.
A new view of human nature
&s;eemed to bur&s;t, at once, upon his mind,
and he could not have experienced greater
a&s;toni&s;hment, if this had been the fir&s;t
moment, in which he had heard of the in|&s;titution.
But, when he thought of Elle|na,
con&s;idered that &s;he was in the power
of this tribunal, and that it was probable
&s;he was at this moment within the &s;ame
dreadful walls, grief, indignation, and de|&s;pair
irritated him almo&s;t to frenzy. He
&s;eemed &s;uddenly animated with &s;uperna|tural
&s;trength, and ready to attempt im|po&s;&s;ibilities
for her deliverance. It was by
a &s;trong effort for &s;elf command, that he
forbore bur&s;ting the bonds, which held
him, and making a de&s;perate attempt to
&s;eek her through the va&s;t extent of the&s;e
pri&s;ons. Reflection, however, had not &s;o
<PB N="193" REF="194">
entirely for&s;aken him, but that he &s;aw the
impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding in &s;uch an ef|fort,
the moment he had conceived it, and
he forbore to ru&s;h upon the certain de|&s;truction,
to which it mu&s;t have led. His
pa&s;&s;ions, thus re&s;trained, &s;eemed to become
virtues, and to di&s;play them&s;elves in the
energy of his courage and his fortitude.
His &s;oul became &s;tern and vigorous in
de&s;pair, and his manner and countenance
a&s;&s;umed a calm dignity, which &s;eemed to
awe, in &s;ome degree, even his guards. The
pain of his wounds was no longer felt; it
appeared as if the &s;trength of his intellect|tual
&s;elf had &s;ubdued the infirmities of
the body, and, perhaps, in the&s;e moments
of elevation, he could have endured the
torture without &s;hrinking.</P>
<P>Paulo, meanwhile, mute and grave, was
watchful of all that pa&s;&s;ed; he ob&s;erved
the revolutions in his ma&s;ter's mind, with
grief fir&s;t, and then with &s;urprize, but he
could not imitate the noble fortitude, which
now gave weight and &s;teadine&s;s to Vivaldi's
<PB N="194" REF="195">
thoughts. And when he looked on the
power and gloom around him, and on the
vi&s;ages of the pa&s;&s;ing Inqui&s;itors, he began
to repent, that he had &s;o freely delivered
his opinion of this tribunal, in the pre|fence
of its agents, and to perceive, that
if he played up the kind of tune he had
threatened, it would probably be the la&s;t
he &s;hould ever be permitted to perform in
this world.</P>
<P>At length, the chief officer de&s;cended the
&s;tair-ca&s;e, and immediately bade Vivaldi
follow him. Paulo was accompanying
his ma&s;ter, but was withheld by the guard,
and told he was to be di&s;po&s;ed of in a dif|ferent
way. This was the moment of his
&s;evere&s;t trial; he declared he would not
be &s;eparated from his ma&s;ter&punc;</P>
<P>"What did I demand to be brought
here for," he cried, "if it was not that I
might go &s;hares with the Signor in all his
troubles? This is not a place to come to
for plea&s;ure, I warrant; and I can promi&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="196">
ye, gentlemen, I would not have come
within an hundred miles of you, if it had
not been for my ma&s;ter's &s;ake."</P>
<P>The guards roughly interrupted him,
and were carrying him away, when Vival|di's
commanding voice arre&s;ted them.
He returned to &s;peak a few words of con|&s;olation
to his faithful &s;ervant, and, &s;ince
they were to be &s;eparated, to take leave of
him.</P>
<P>Paulo embraced his knees, and, while
he wept, and his words were almo&s;t &s;tifled
by &s;obs, declared no force &s;hould drag
him from his ma&s;ter, while he had life;
and repeatedly appealed to the guards,
with&mdash;"What did I demand to be
brought here for? Did ever any body
come here to &s;eek plea&s;ure? What right
have you to prevent my going &s;hares with
my ma&s;ter in his troubles?"</P>
<P>"We do not intend to deny you that
plea&s;ure, friend," replied one of the guards!</P>
<P>"Don't you? Then heaven ble&s;s you!"
<PB N="196" REF="197">
cried Paulo, &s;pringing From his knees, and
&s;haking the man by the hand with a vio|lence,
that would nearly have di&s;located
the &s;houlder of a per&s;on le&s;s robu&s;t.</P>
<P>"So come with us," added the guard,
drawing him away from Vivaldi. Paulo
now became outrageous, and, &s;truggling
with the guards, bur&s;t from them, and
again fell at the feet of his ma&s;ter, who
rai&s;ed and embraced him, endeavouring
to prevail with him to &s;ubmit quietly to
what was inevitable, and to encourage him
with hope.</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t that our &s;eparation will be
&s;hort" &s;aid Vivaldi, "and that we &s;hall
meet in happier circum&s;tances. My
innocence mu&s;t &s;oon appear."</P>
<P>"We &s;hall never, never meet again,
Signormio, in this world," &s;aid Paulo, &s;ob|bing
violently, "&s;o don't make me hope
&s;o. That old Abbe&s;s knows what &s;he is
about too well to let us e&s;cape; or &s;he
would not have catched us up &s;o cunningly
<PB N="197" REF="198">
as &s;he did; &s;o what &s;ignifies innocence!
O! if my old lord, the Marche&s;e, did but
know where we are!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi interrupted him, and turning to
the guards &s;aid, "I recommend my faith|ful
&s;ervant to your compa&s;&s;ion; he is inno|cent.
It will &s;ome time, perhaps, be in
my power to recompence you for any in|dulgence
you may allow him, and I &s;hall
value it a thou&s;and times more highly,
than any you could &s;hew to my&s;elf! Fare|well,
Paulo,&mdash;farewel! Officer, I am
ready."</P>
<P>"O &s;tay! Signor, for one moment&mdash;&s;tay!"
&s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>"We can wait no longer," &s;aid the
guard, and again drew Paulo away, who
looking piteou&s;ly after Vivaldi, alternately
repeated, Farewel, dear mae&s;tro! farewel
dear, dear mae&s;tro!" and "What did I
demand to be brought here for? What
did I demand to be brought here for?&mdash;what
was it for, if not to go &s;hares with my
<PB N="198" REF="199">
mae&s;tro?" till Vivaldi was beyond the
reach of &s;ight and of hearing.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having followed the officer up
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed through a gallery to
an anti-chamber, where, being delivered
into the cu&s;tody of &s;ome per&s;ons in wait|ing,
his conductor di&s;appeared beyond a
folding door, that led to an inner apart|ments.
Over this door was an in&s;cription in
Hebrew characters, traced in blood-colour.
Dante's in&s;cription on the entrance of the
infernal regions, would have been &s;uitable to
a place, where every circum&s;tance and fea|ture
&s;eemed to &s;ay, "<HI>Hope, that comes to
all, comes not here!".</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi conjectured, that in this cham|ber
they were preparing for him the in|&s;truments,
which were to extort a confe&s;|ion;
and though he knew little of the re|gular
proceedings of this tribunal, he had
always under&s;tood, that the torture was
inflicted upon the accu&s;ed per&s;on, till he
made confe&s;&s;ion of the crime, of which he
was &s;u&s;pected. By &s;uch a mode of pro|ceeding,
<PB N="199" REF="200">
the innocent were certain of &s;uf|fering
longer than the guilty; for, as they
had nothing to confe&s;s, the Inqui&s;itor,
mi&s;taking innocence for ob&s;tinacy, per&s;e|vered
in his inflictions, and it frequently
happened that he compelled the innocent
to become criminal, and a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood,
that they might be relea&s;ed from an|gui&s;h,
which they could no longer &s;u&s;tain.
Vivaldi con&s;idered this circum&s;tance un|dauntedly;
every faculty of his &s;oul was
bent up to firmne&s;s and endurance. He
believed that he under&s;tood the extent of
the charge, which would be brought
again&s;t him, a charge as fal&s;e, as a &s;pecious
confirmation of it, would be terrible in it's
con&s;equence both to Ellena and him&s;elf.
Yet every art would be practi&s;ed to bring
him to an acknowledgment of having car|ried
off a nun, and he knew al&s;o, that,
&s;ince the pro&s;ecutor and the witne&s;&s;es are
never confronted with the pri&s;oner in ca&s;es
of &s;evere accu&s;ation, and &s;ince their very
<PB N="200" REF="201">
names are concealed from him, it would
be &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for him to prove his
innocence. But he did not he&s;itate an
in&s;tant whether to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for
Ellena, determining rather to expire be|neath
the mercile&s;s inflictions of the In|qui&s;itors,
than to a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood, which
mu&s;t involve her in de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The officer, at length, appeared, and,
having beckoned Vivaldi to advance, un|covered
his head, and bared his arms. He
then led him forward through the folding
door into the chamber; having done
which, he immediately withdrew, and the
door, which &s;hut out Hope, clo&s;ed after
him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious
apartment, where only two per&s;ons were
vi&s;ible, who were &s;eated at a large table,
that occupied the centre of the room.
They were both habited in black; the one,
who &s;eemed by his piercing eye, and ex|traordinary
phy&s;iognomy, to be an Inqui|&s;itor,
<PB N="201" REF="202">
wore on his head a kind of black
turban, which heightened the natural fe|rocity
of his vi&s;age; the other was unco|vered,
and his arms bared to the elbows.
A book, with &s;ome in&s;truments of &s;ingular
appearance, lay before him. Round the
table were &s;everal unoccupied chairs, on
the backs of which appeared figurative
&s;igns, at the upper end of the apart|ment,
a gigantic crucifix &s;tretched nearly
to the vaulted roof; and, at the lower end,
&s;u&s;pended from an arch in the wall, was a
dark curtain, but whether it veiled a win|dow,
or &s;hrowded &s;ome object or per&s;on,
nece&s;&s;ary to the de&s;igns of the Inqui&s;itor,
there were little means of judging. It was,
however, &s;u&s;pended from an arch &s;uch as
&s;ometimes contains a ca&s;ement, or leads to
a deep rece&s;s.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor called on Vivaldi to ad|vance,
and, when he had reached the ta|ble,
put a book into his hands, and bade
him &s;wear to reveal the truth, and keep
<PB N="202" REF="203">
for ever &s;ecret whatever he might &s;ee or
hear in the apartment.</P>
<P>Vivaldi he&s;itated to obey &s;o unqualified
a command. The Inqui&s;itor reminded
him, by a look, not to be mi&s;taken, that
he was ab&s;olute here; but Vivaldi &s;till he|&s;itated.
"Shall I con&s;ent to my own
condemnation?" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "The
malice of demons like the&s;e may convert
the mo&s;t innocent circum&s;tances into mat|ter
of accu&s;ation, for my de&s;truction, and
I mu&s;t an&s;wer whatever que&s;tions they
choo&s;e to a&s;k. And &s;hall I &s;wear, al&s;o, to
conceal whatever I may witne&s;s in this
chamber, when I know that the mo&s;t dia|bolical
cruelties are hourly practi&s;ed here?"</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor, in a voice which would
have made a heart le&s;s fortified than was
Vivaldi's tremble, again commanded him
to &s;wear; at the &s;ame time, he made a
&s;ignal to the per&s;on, who &s;at at the oppo|&s;ite
end of the table, and who appeared to
be an inferior officer.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
Vivaldi was &s;till &s;ilent, but, he began to
con&s;ider that, uncon&s;cious as he was of
crime, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for his words
to be tortured into a &s;elf-accu&s;ation; and
that, whatever he might witne&s;s, no retri|bution
would be prevented, no evil with|held
by the oath, which bound him to
&s;ecre&s;y, &s;ince his mo&s;t &s;evere denunciation
could avail nothing again&s;t the &s;upreme
power of this tribunal. As he did not
perceive any good, which could ari&s;e from
refu&s;ing the oath; and &s;aw much imme|diate
evil from re&s;i&s;tance, he con&s;ented to
receive it. Notwith&s;tanding this, when
he put the book to his lips, and uttered
the tremendous vow pre&s;cribed to him,
he&s;itation and reluctance returned upon
his mind, and an icy coldne&s;s &s;truck to his
heart. He was &s;o much affected, that
circum&s;tances, apparently the mo&s;t trivial,
had at this moment influence upon his
imagination. As he accidentally threw
his eyes upon the curtain, which he had
<PB N="204" REF="205">
ob&s;erved before without emotion, and
now thought it moved, he almo&s;t &s;tarted
in expectation of &s;eeing &s;ome per&s;on, an
Inqui&s;itor perhaps, as terrific as the one
before him, or an Accu&s;er as malicious as
Schedoni, &s;teal from behind it.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor having admini&s;tered the
oath, and the attendant having noted it in
his book, the examination began. After
demanding, as is u&s;ual, the names and
titles of Vivaldi and his family, and his
place of re&s;idence, to which he fully re|plied,
the Inqui&s;itor a&s;ked, whether he
under&s;tood the nature of the accu&s;ation
on which he had been arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>"The order for my arre&s;tation informed
me." replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Look to your words!" &s;aid the Inqui|&s;itor,
"and remember your oath. What
was the ground of accu&s;ation?"</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood," &s;aid Vivaldi, "that I
was accu&s;ed of having &s;tolen a nun from
her &s;anctuary."</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">
A faint degree of &s;urpri&s;e appeared on
the brow of the Inqui&s;itor. "You confe&s;s
it, then?" he &s;aid, after the pau&s;e of a
moment, and making a &s;ignal to the Se|cretary,
who immediately noted Vivaldi's
words.</P>
<P>"I &s;olemnly deny it," replied Vivaldi,
"the accu&s;ation is fal&s;e and mali|cious."</P>
<P>"Remember the oath you have taken!"
repeated the Inqui&s;itor, "learn al&s;o, that
mercy is &s;hewn to &s;uch as make full con|fe&s;&s;ion;
but that the torture is applied to
tho&s;e, who have the folly and the ob&s;tinacy
to withhold the truth."</P>
<P>"If you torture me till I acknowledge
the ju&s;tne&s;s of this accu&s;ation," &s;aid Vi|valdi,
"I mu&s;t expire under your inflic|tions,
for &s;uffering never &s;hall compel me
to a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood. It is not the truth,
which you &s;eek; it is not the guilty, whom
you puni&s;h; the innocent, having no
crimes to confe&s;s, are the victims of your
<PB N="206" REF="207">
cruelty, or, to e&s;cape from it, become cri|minal,
and proclam a lie."</P>
<P>"Recollect your&s;elf," &s;aid the Inqui&s;i|tor,
&s;ternly. "You are not brought hi|ther
to accu&s;e, but to an&s;wer accu&s;ation.
You &s;ay you are innocent; yet acknow|ledge
your&s;elf to be acquainted with
the &s;ubject of the charge which is to be
urged again&s;t you! How could you
know this, but from the voice of con|&s;cience?"</P>
<P>"From the words of your own &s;um|mons,"
replied Vivaldi, "and from tho&s;e
of your officials who arre&s;ted me."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed the Inqui&s;itor,
"note that," pointing to the Secretary;
"he &s;ays by the words of our &s;ummons;
now we know, that you never read that
&s;ummons. He &s;ays al&s;o by the words of
our officials;&mdash;it appears, then, he is igno|rant,
that death would follow &s;uch a breach
of confidence."</P>
<P>"It is true, I never did read the &s;um|mons,"
<PB N="207" REF="208">
replied Vivaldi, "and as true, that
I never a&s;&s;erted I did; the friar, who read
it, told of what it accu&s;ed me, and your
officials confirmed the te&s;timony."</P>
<P>"No more of this equivocation!" &s;aid
the Inqui&s;itor, "Speak only to the que&s;|tion."</P>
<P>"I will not &s;uffer my a&s;&s;ertions to be
mi&s;repre&s;ented," replied Vivaldi, "or my
words to be perverted again&s;t my&s;elf. I
have &s;worn to &s;peak the truth only; &s;ince
you believe I violate my oath, and doubt
my direct and &s;imple words, I will &s;peak
no more."</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor half ro&s;e from his chair,
and his countenance grew paler. "Auda|cious
heretic!" he &s;aid, "will you di&s;pute,
in&s;ult, and di&s;obey, the commands of our
mo&s;t holy tribunal! You will be taught
the con&s;equence of your de&s;perate im|piety.
&mdash;To the torture with him!"</P>
<P>A &s;tern &s;mile was on the features of
Vivaldi, his eyes were calmly fixed on the
<PB N="208" REF="209">
Inqui&s;itor, and his attitude was undaunted
and firm. His courage, and the cool
contempt, which his looks expre&s;&s;ed,
&s;eemed to touch his examiner, who per|ceived
that he had not a common mind to
operate upon. He abandoned, therefore,
for the pre&s;ent, terrific mea&s;ures, and, re|&s;uming
his u&s;ual manner, proceeded in the
examination.</P>
<P>"Where were you arre&s;ted?"</P>
<P>"At the chapel of San Seba&s;tian, on the
lake of Celano."</P>
<P>"You are certain as to this?" a&s;ked
the Inqui&s;itor, "you are &s;ure it was not
at the village of Legano, on the high road
between Celano and Rome?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, while he confirmed his a&s;&s;er|tion,
recollected with &s;ome &s;urprize that
Legano was the place where the guard
had been changed, and he mentioned the
circum&s;tance. The Inqui&s;itor, however,
proceeded in his que&s;tions, without ap|pearing
to notice it. "Was any per&s;on
arre&s;ted with you?"</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">
"You cannot be ignorant," replied Vi|valdi,
"that Signora di Ro&s;alba, was
&s;eized at the &s;ame time, upon the fal&s;e
charge of being a nun, who had broken
her vows, and eloped from her convent;
nor that Paulo Mendrico, my faithful
&s;ervant! was al&s;o made a pri&s;oner, though
upon what pretence he was arre&s;ted I am
utterly ignorant."</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor remained for &s;ome mo|ments
in thoughtful &s;ilence, and then
enquired &s;lightly concerning the family of
Ellena, and her u&s;ual place of re&s;idence.
Vivaldi, fearful of making &s;ome a&s;&s;ertion
that might be prejudicial to her, referred
him to her&s;elf; but the inquiry was
repeated.</P>
<P>"She is now within the&s;e walls," re|plied
Vivaldi, hoping to learn from the
manner of his examiner, whether his fears
were ju&s;t, "and can an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions
better than my&s;elf."</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor merely bade the Notary
<PB N="210" REF="211">
write down her name, and then remained
for a few moments meditating. At length,
he &s;aid, "Do you know where you now
are?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;miling the que&s;tion, replied,
"I under&s;tand that I am in the pri&s;ons of
the Inqui&s;ition, at Rome."</P>
<P>"Do you know what are the crimes
that &s;ubject per&s;ons to the cognizance of
the Holy Office?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Your con&s;cience informs <HI>you,</HI> and your
&s;ilence confirms <HI>me.</HI> Let me admoni&s;h
you, once more, to make a full confe&s;&s;ion
of your guilt; remember that this is a
merciful tribunal, and &s;hews favour to
&s;uch as acknowledge their crimes?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;miled; but the Inqui&s;itor pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>"It does not re&s;emble &s;ome &s;evere, yet
ju&s;t courts, where immediate execution
follows the confe&s;&s;ion of a criminal. No!
it is merciful, and though it puni&s;hes
<PB N="211" REF="212">
guilt, it never applies the torture but in
ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, when the ob&s;tinate &s;i|lence
of the pri&s;oner requires &s;uch a mea|&s;ure.
You &s;ee, therefore, what you may
avoid, and what expect."</P>
<P>"But if the pri&s;oner has nothing to
confe&s;s?" &s;aid Vivaldi,&mdash;"Can your tor|tures
make him guilty? They may force
a weak mind to be guilty of fal&s;ehood;
to e&s;cape pre&s;ent angui&s;h, a man may un|warily
condemn him&s;elf to the death!
You will find that I am not &s;uch an one."</P>
<P>"Young man," replied the Inqui&s;itor,
"you will under&s;tand too &s;oon, that we
never act, but upon &s;ure authority; and
will wi&s;h, too late, that you had made an
hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion. Your &s;ilence cannot
keep from us a knowledge of your of|fences;
we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of facts; and
your ob&s;tinacy can neither wre&s;t from us
the truth, or pervert it. Your mo&s;t &s;e|cret
offences are already written on the
tablets of the Holy Office; your con|&s;cience
<PB N="212" REF="213">
cannot reflect them more ju&s;tly.&mdash;Tremble,
therefore, and revere. But un|der&s;tand,
that, though we have &s;ufficient
proof of your guilt, we require you to
confe&s;s; and that the puni&s;hment of ob|&s;tinacy
is as certain, as that of any other
offence."</P>
<P>Vivaldi made no reply, and the Inqui&s;i|tor,
after a momentary &s;ilence, added,
"Was you ever in the church of the Spi|rito
Santo, at Naples?"</P>
<P>"Before I an&s;wer the que&s;tion," &s;aid
Vivaldi, "I require the name of my
accu&s;er."</P>
<P>"You are to recollect that you have no
right to demand any thing in this place,"
ob&s;erved the Inqui&s;itor, "nor can you be
ignorant that the name of the Informer is
always kept &s;acred from the knowledge of
the Accu&s;ed. Who would venture to do
his duty, if his name was arbitrarily to be
expo&s;ed to the vengeance of the criminal
again&s;t whom he informs? It is only in a
<PB N="213" REF="214">
particular proce&s;s that the Accu&s;er is
brought forward,"</P>
<P>"The names of the Witne&s;&s;es?" demand|ed
Vivaldi. The &s;ame ju&s;tice conceals them
al&s;o from the knowledge of the Accu&s;ed,
replied the Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"And is no ju&s;tice left for the Ac|cu&s;ed?"
&s;aid Vivaldi. "Is he to be tried
and condemned without being confront|ed
with either his Pro&s;ecutor, or the
Witne&s;&s;es!"</P>
<P>"Your que&s;tions are too many," &s;aid
the Inqui&s;itor, and your an&s;wers too few.
The Informer is not al&s;o the Pro&s;ecutor;
the Holy Office, before which the inform|ation
is laid, is the Pro&s;ecutor, and the
di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice; its Public Accu&s;er
lays the circum&s;tances, and the te&s;timonies
of the Witne&s;&s;es, before the Court. But
too much of this."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "is the
tribunal at once the Pro&s;ecutor, Witne&s;s,
and Judge! What can private malice
<PB N="214" REF="215">
wi&s;h for more, than &s;uch a court of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI>
at which to arraign it's enemy? The
&s;tiletto of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is not &s;o &s;ure, or
&s;o fatal to innocence. I now perceive,
that it avails me nothing to be guiltle&s;s;
a &s;ingle enemy is &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h
my de&s;truction."</P>
<P>"You have an enemy then?" ob&s;erved
the Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was too well convinced that he
had one, but there was not &s;ufficient proof,
as to the per&s;on of this enemy, to ju&s;tify,
him in a&s;&s;erting that it was Schedoni.
The circum&s;tance of Ellena having been
arre&s;ted, would have compelled him to
&s;u&s;pect another per&s;on as being at lea&s;t
acce&s;&s;ary to the de&s;igns of the Confe&s;&s;or,
had not credulity &s;tarted in horror from
the &s;uppo&s;ition, that a mother's re&s;ent|ment
could po&s;&s;ibly betray her &s;on into
the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition, though this
mother had exhibited a temper of re|mor&s;ele&s;s
cruelty towards a &s;tranger, who
had interrupted her views for that &s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216">
"You have an enemy then?" repeated
the Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"That I am here &s;ufficiently proves it,"
replied Vivaldi. "But I am &s;o little any
man's enemy, that I know not who to call
mine."</P>
<P>"It is evident, then, that you have no
enemy," ob&s;erved the &s;ubtle Inqui&s;itor,
"and that this accu&s;ation is brought
again&s;t you by a re&s;pecter of truth, and
a faithful &s;ervant of the Roman intere&s;t."</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;hocked to perceive the
in&s;idious art, by which he had been be|trayed
into a declaration apparently &s;o
harmle&s;s, and the cruel dexterity with
which it had been turned again&s;t him. A
lofty and contemptuous &s;ilence was all
that he oppo&s;ed to the treachery of his
examiner, on who&s;e countenance appear|ed
a &s;mile of triumph and &s;elf-congratula|tion,
the life of a fellow creature being, in
his e&s;timation, of no comparative impor|tance
with the &s;elf-applau&s;es of &s;ucce&s;s|ful
<PB N="216" REF="217">
art; the art, too, upon which he mo&s;t
valued him&s;elf&mdash;that of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor proceeded, "You per|&s;i&s;t
then, in withholding the truth?"
He pau&s;ed, but Vivaldi making no reply,
he re&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Since it is evident, from your own
declaration, that you have no enemy,
whom private re&s;entment might have in|&s;tigated
to accu&s;e you; and, from other
circum&s;tances which have occurred in
your conduct, that you are con&s;cious of
more than you have confe&s;&s;ed,&mdash;it appears,
that the accu&s;ation which has been urged
again&s;t you, is not a malicious &s;lander. I
exhort you, therefore, and once more con|jure
you, by our holy faith, to make an
ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion of your offences, and
to fare your&s;elf from the means, which
mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be enforced to obtain a
confe&s;&s;ion before your trial commences.
I adjure you, al&s;o, to con&s;ider, that by
&s;uch open conduct only, can mercy be
<PB N="217" REF="218">
won to &s;often the ju&s;tice of this mo&s;t
righteous tribunal!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, perceiving that it was now ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for him to reply, once more &s;o|lemnly
a&s;&s;erted his innocence of the crime
alledged again&s;t him in the &s;ummons, and
of the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any act, which
might lawfully &s;ubject him to the notice
of the Holy Office.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor again demanded what
was the crime alledged, and, Vivaldi having
repeated the accu&s;ation, he again bade the
Secretary note it, as he did which, Vivaldi
thought he perceived upon his features
&s;omething of a malignant &s;atisfaction, for
which he knew not how to account.
When the Secretary had fini&s;hed, Vivaldi
was ordered to &s;ub&s;cribe his name and
quality to the depo&s;itions, and he
obeyed.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor then bade him con&s;ider
of the admonition he had received, and
prepare either to confe&s;s on the morrow,
<PB N="218" REF="219">
or to undergo the que&s;tion As he con|cluded,
he gave a &s;ignal, and the officer,

<P>ELLENA, meanwhile, when &s;he had been
carried from the chapel of San Seba&s;tian,
was placed upon a hor&s;e in waiting, and,
guarded by the two men who had &s;eized
her, commenced a journey, which conti|nued
with little interruption during two
nights and days. She had no means of
judging whither &s;he was going, and li&s;tened
<PB N="220" REF="221">
in vain expectation, for the feet of hor&s;es,
and the voice of Vivaldi, who, &s;he had
been told, was following on the &s; &s;ame
read.</P>
<P>The &s;teps of travellers &s;eldom broke
upon the &s;ilence of the&s;e regions, and,
during the journey, &s;he was met only by
&s;ome market-people pa&s;&s;ing to a neigh|bouring
town, or now and then by the
vine-dre&s;&s;ers or labourers in the olive
grounds; and &s;he de&s;cended upon the va&s;t
plains of Apulia, &s;till ignorant of her &s;i|tuation.
An encampment, not of war|riors,
but of &s;hepherds, who were leading
their flocks to the mountains of Abruzzo,
enlivened a &s;mall tract of the&s;e levels,
which were &s;hadowed on the north and
ea&s;t by the mountainous ridge of the
Garganus, &s;tretching from the Apennine
far into the Adriatic.</P>
<P>The appearance of the &s;hepherds was
nearly as wild and &s;avage as that of the
men, who conducted Ellena; but their
<PB N="221" REF="222">
pa&s;toral in&s;truments of flageolets and ta|bors
&s;poke of more civilized feelings, as
they &s;ounded &s;weetly over the de&s;ert.
Her guards re&s;ted, and refre&s;hed them|&s;elves
with goats milk, barley cakes, and
almonds, and the manners of the&s;e &s;hep|herds,
like tho&s;e &s;he had formerly met
with on the mountains, proved to be more
ho&s;pitable than their air had indicated.</P>
<P>After Ellena had quitted this pa&s;toral
camp, no ve&s;tige of a human re&s;idence ap|peared
for &s;everal leagues, except here and
there the towers of a decayed fortre&s;s,
perched upon the lofty acclivities &s;he was
approaching, and half concealed in the
woods. The evening of the &s;econd day
was drawing on, when her guards drew
near the fore&s;t, which &s;he had long ob|&s;erved
in the di&s;tance, &s;preading over the
many-ri&s;ing &s;teeps of the Garganus. They
entered by a track, a road it could not be
called, which led among oaks and gigantic
<PB N="222" REF="223">
che&s;tnuts, apparently the growth of centu|ries,
and &s;o thickly interwoven, that their
branches formed a canopy which &s;eldom
admitted the &s;ky. The gloom which they
threw around, and the thickets of cy&s;tus,
juniper, and lenticus, which flouri&s;hed be|neath
the &s;hade, gave a character of fearful
wildne&s;s to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Having reached an eminence, where the
trees were more thinly &s;cattered, Ellena
perceived the fore&s;ts &s;preading on all &s;ides
among hills and vallies, and de&s;cending to|wards
the Adriatic, which bounded the
di&s;tance in front. The coa&s;t, bending in|to
a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty
pinnacles, wooded to their &s;ummits, ro&s;e
over the &s;hores, and cliffs of naked marble
of &s;uch gigantic proportions, that they
were awful even at a di&s;tance, obtruded
them&s;elves far into the waves, brea&s;ting
their eternal fury. Beyond the margin of
the coa&s;t, as far as the eye could reach,
appeared pointed mountains, darkened with
<PB N="223" REF="224">
fore&s;ts, ri&s;ing ridge over ridge in many &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ions.
Ellena, as &s;he &s;urveyed this wild
&s;cenery, felt as if &s;he was going into eternal
bani&s;hment from &s;ociety. She was tran|quil,
but it was with the quietne&s;s of ex|hau&s;ted
grief, not of re&s;ignation; and &s;he
looked back upon the pa&s;t, and awaited
the future, with a kind of out-breathed
de&s;pair.</P>
<P>She had travelled for &s;ome miles through
the fore&s;t, her guards only now and then ut|tering
to each other a que&s;tion, or an ob|&s;ervation
concerning the changes which
had taken place in the bordering &s;cenery,
&s;ince they la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed it, when night began
to clo&s;e in upon them.</P>
<P>Ellena perceived her approach to the &s;ea,
only by the murmurs of its &s;urge upon the
rocky coa&s;t, till, having reached an emi|nence,
which was, however, no more than the
ba&s;e of two woody mountains that tower|ed
clo&s;ely over it, &s;he &s;aw dimly it's gray
&s;urface &s;preading in the bay below. She
<PB N="224" REF="225">
now ventured to a&s;k how much further &s;he
was to go, and whether &s;he was to be taken
on board one of the little ve&s;&s;els, appa|rently
fi&s;hing &s;macks, that &s;he could ju&s;t
di&s;cern at anchor.</P>
<P>"You have not far to go now," replied
one of the guards, &s;urlily; "you will
&s;oon be at the end of your journey, and at
re&s;t."</P>
<P>They de&s;cended to the &s;hore, and pre|&s;ently
came to a lonely dwelling, which
&s;tood &s;o near the margin of the &s;ea, as al|mo&s;t
to be wa&s;hed by the waves. No light
appeared at any of the lattices; and, from
the &s;ilence that reigned within, it &s;eemed
to be uninhabited. The guard had pro|bably
rea&s;on to know otherwi&s;e, for they
halted at the door, and &s;houted with all
their &s;trength. No voice, however, an|&s;wered
to their call, and, while they per&s;e|vered
in efforts to rou&s;e the inhabitants,
Ellena anxiou&s;ly examined the building,
as exactly as the twilight would permit.
<PB N="225" REF="226">
It was of an ancient and peculiar &s;tructure,
and, though &s;carcely important enough for
a man&s;ion, had evidently never been de|&s;igned
for the re&s;idence of pea&s;ants.</P>
<P>The walls, of unhewn marble, were high,
and &s;trengthened by ba&s;tions; and the edi|fice
had turretted corners, which, with
the porch in front, and the &s;loping roof,
were falling fa&s;t into numerous &s;ymptoms
of decay. The whole building, with it's
dark windows and &s;oundle&s;s avenues, had
an air &s;trikingly forlorn and &s;olitary. A
high wall &s;urrounded the &s;mall court in
which it &s;tood, and probably had once
&s;erved as a defence to the dwelling; but
the gates, which &s;hould have clo&s;ed again&s;t
intruders, could no longer perform their
office; one of the folds had dropped from
it's fa&s;tenings, and lay on the ground al|mo&s;t
concealed in a deep bed of weeds,
and the other creaked on its hinges to
every bla&s;t, at each &s;wing &s;eeming ready to
follow the fate of it's companion.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227">
The repeated calls of the guard, were,
at length, an&s;wered by a rough voice
from within; when the door of the porch
was lazily unbarred, and opened by a man,
who&s;e vi&s;age was &s;o mi&s;ery-&s;truck, that
Ellena could not look upon it with indif|ference,
though wrapt in mi&s;ery of her
own. The lamp he held threw a gleam
athwart it, and &s;hewed the gaunt ferocity
of famine, to which the &s;hadow of his hol|low
eyes added a terrific wildne&s;s. Ellena
&s;hrunk while &s;he gazed. She had never
before &s;een villainy and &s;uffering &s;o &s;trong|ly
pictured on the &s;ame face, and &s;he ob|&s;erved
him with a degree of thrilling cu|rio&s;ity,
which for a moment excluded from
her mind all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evils to
be apprehended from him.</P>
<P>It was evident that this hou&s;e had not
been built for his reception; and &s;he
conjectured, that he was the &s;ervant of
&s;ome cruel agent of the Marche&s;a di
Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="228">
From the porch, &s;he followed into an
old hall, ruinous, and de&s;titute of any kind
of furniture. It was not exten&s;ive but
lofty, for it &s;eemed to a&s;cend to the roof
of the edifice, and the chambers above
opened around it into a corridor.</P>
<P>Some half-&s;ullen &s;alutations were ex|changed
between the guard and the &s;tran|ger,
whom they called Spalatro, as they
pa&s;&s;ed into a chamber, where, it appeared
that he had been &s;leeping on a mattre&s;s
laid in a corner. All the other furniture
of the place, were two or three broken
chairs and a table. He eyed Ellena with
a &s;hrewd contracted brow, and then look|ed
&s;ignificantly at the guard, but was &s;i|lent,
till he de&s;ired them all to &s;it down,
adding, that he would dre&s;s &s;ome fi&s;h for
&s;upper. Ellena di&s;covered that this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
was the ma&s;ter of the place; it appear|ed
al&s;o that he was the only inhabitant;
and, when the guard &s;oon after informed
her their journey concluded here, her wor&s;t
<PB N="228" REF="229">
apprehen&s;ions were confirmed. The ef|forts
&s;he made to &s;u&s;tain her &s;pirits,
were no longer &s;ucce&s;sful. It &s;eemed that
&s;he was brought hither by ruffians to a
lonely hou&s;e on the &s;ea-&s;hore, inhabited
by a man, who had "villain" engraved in
every line of his face, to be the victim of
inexorable pride and an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of
revenge. After con&s;idering the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
and the words, which had ju&s;t told
her, &s;he was to go no further, conviction
&s;truck like lightning upon her heart; and,
believing &s;he was brought hither to be a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated,
horror chilled all her frame, and
her &s;en&s;es for&s;ook her.</P>
<P>On recovering, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;ur|rounded
by the guard and the &s;tranger,
and &s;he would have &s;upplicated for their
pity, but that &s;he feared to exa&s;perate
them by betraying her &s;u&s;picions. She
complained of fatigue, and reque&s;ted to
be &s;hewn to her room. The men looked
upon one another, he&s;itated, and then
<PB N="229" REF="230">
a&s;ked her to partake of the fi&s;h that was
preparing. But Ellena having declined
the invitation with as good a grace as &s;he
could a&s;&s;ume, they con&s;ented that &s;he
&s;hould withdraw. Spalatro, taking the
lamp, lighted her acro&s;s the hall, to the
corridor above, where he opened the door
of a chamber, in which he &s;aid &s;he was to
&s;leep.</P>
<P>"Where is my bed?" &s;aid the afflicted
Ellena, fearfully as &s;he looked round.</P>
<P>"It is there&mdash;on the floor," replied
Spalatro, pointing to a mi&s;erable mattre&s;s,
over which hung the tattered curtains of
what had once been a canopy. "If you
want the lamp," he added, "I will leave
it, and come for it in a minute or two."</P>
<P>"Will you not let me have a lamp for
the night," &s;he &s;aid in a &s;upplicating and
timid voice.</P>
<P>"For the night!" &s;aid the man
gruffly; "What! to &s;et fire to the
hou&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231">
Ellena &s;till entreated that he would al|low
her the comfort of a light.</P>
<P>"Ay, ay," replied Spalatro, with a
look &s;he could not comprehend, "it would
be a great comfort to you, truly! You do
not know what you a&s;k."</P>
<P>"What is it that you mean?" &s;aid El|lena,
eagerly; "I conjure you, in the name
of our holy church, to tell me!"</P>
<P>Spalatro &s;tepped &s;uddenly back, and
looked upon her with &s;urpri&s;e, but with|out
&s;peaking.</P>
<P>"Have mercy on me!" &s;aid Ellena,
greatly alarmed by his manner; "I am
friendle&s;s, and without help!"</P>
<P>"What do you fear," &s;aid the man, re|covering
him&s;elf; and then, without wait|ing
her reply, added&mdash;"Is it &s;uch an
unmerciful deed to take away a lamp?"</P>
<P>Ellena, who again feared to betray the
extent of her &s;u&s;picions, only replied, that
it would be merciful to leave it, for that
her &s;pirits were low, and &s;he required light
to cheer them in a new abode.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">
"We do not &s;tand upon &s;uch conceits
here," replied Spalatro, "we have other
matters to mind. Be&s;ides, it's the only
lamp in the hou&s;e, and the company be|low
are in darkne&s;s while I am lo&s;ing time
here. I will leave it for two minutes, and
no more." Ellena made a &s;ign for him
to put down the lamp; and, when he left
the room, &s;he heard the door barred upon
her.</P>
<P>She employed the&s;e two minutes in ex|amining
the chamber, and the po&s;&s;ibility
it might afford of an e&s;cape. It was a
large apartment, unfurni&s;hed and un&s;wept
of the cobweps of many years. The only
door &s;he di&s;covered was the one, by which
&s;he had entered, and the only window a
lattice, which was grated. Such prepara|tion
for preventing e&s;cape &s;eemed to hint
how much there might be to e&s;cape from.</P>
<P>Having examined the chamber, with|out
finding a &s;ingle circum&s;tance to encou|rage
hope, tried the &s;trength of the bars,
<PB N="232" REF="233">
which &s;he could not &s;hake, and &s;ought in
vain for an in&s;ide fa&s;tening to her door, &s;he
placed the lamp be&s;ide it, and awaited the
return of Spalatro. In a few moments
he came, and offered her a cup of &s;our wine
with a &s;lice of bread; which, being &s;ome|what
&s;oothed by this attention, &s;he did not
think proper to reject.</P>
<P>Spalatro then quitted the room, and
the door was again barred. Left once
more alone, &s;he tried to overcome appre|hen&s;ion
by prayer; and after offering up
her ve&s;pers with a fervent heart, &s;he be|came
more confiding and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he could &s;o
far forget the dangers of her &s;ituation, as
to &s;eek &s;leep, however wearied &s;he might
be, while the door of her room remained
un&s;ecured again&s;t the intru&s;ion of the ruf|fians
below; and, as &s;he had no means of
fa&s;tening it, &s;he determined to watch dur|ing
the whole night. Thus left to &s;oli|tude
and darkne&s;s, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf upon
<PB N="233" REF="234">
the mattre&s;s to await the return of morn|ing,
and was &s;oon lo&s;t in &s;ad reflection;
every minute occurrence of the pa&s;t day,
and of the conduct of her guards, moved
in review before her judgment; and, com|bining
the&s;e with the circum&s;tances of her
pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;carcely a doubt as to the
fate de&s;igned for her remained. It &s;eemed
highly improbable, that the Marche&s;a di
Vivaldi had &s;ent her hither merely for im|pri&s;onment,
&s;ince &s;he might have confined
her in a convent, with much le&s;s trouble;
and &s;till more &s;o, when Ellena con&s;idered the
character of the Marche&s;a, &s;uch as &s;he had
already experienced it. The appearance
of this hou&s;e, and of the man who inha|bited
it, with the circum&s;tance of no wo|man
being found residing here, each and
all of the&s;e &s;ignified, that &s;he was brought
hither, not for long impri&s;onment, but for
death. Her utmo&s;t efforts for fortitude
or re&s;ignation could not overcome the cold
tremblings, the &s;ickne&s;s of heart, the faint|ne&s;s
<PB N="234" REF="235">
and univer&s;al horror, that a&s;&s;ailed her.
How often, with tears of mingled terror
and grief, did &s;he call upon Vivaldi&mdash;Vi|valdi,
alas! &s;ar di&s;tant&mdash;to &s;ave her; how
often exclaim in agony, that &s;he &s;hould
never, never &s;ee him more!</P>
<P>She was &s;pared, however, the horror of
believing that he was an inhabitant of the
Inqui&s;ition. Having detected the impo|&s;ition,
which had been practi&s;ed towards
her&s;elf, and that &s;he was neither on the
way to the Holy Office, nor conducted by
per&s;ons belonging to it, &s;he concluded,
that the whole affair of Vivaldi's arre&s;t, had
been planned by the Marche&s;a, merely as
a pretence for confining him, till &s;he
&s;hould be placed beyond the reach of his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She hoped, therefore, that he
had only been &s;ent to &s;ome private re&s;i|dence
belonging to his family, and that,
when her fate was decided, he would be
relea&s;ed, and &s;he be the only victim. This
was the &s;ole con&s;ideration, that afforded
<PB N="235" REF="236">
any degree of a&s;&s;uagement to her &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P>The people below &s;at till a late hour,
She li&s;tened often to their di&s;tant voices, as
they were di&s;tingui&s;hable in the pau&s;es of
the &s;urge, that broke loud and hollow on
the &s;hore; and every time the creaking
hinges of their room door moved, appre|hended
they were coming to her. At
length, it appeared they had left the apart|ment,
or had fallen a&s;leep there, for a pro|found
&s;tilne&s;s reigned whenever the mur|mur
of the waves &s;unk. Doubt did not
long deceive her, for, while &s;he yet li&s;tened,
&s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed foot&s;teps a&s;cending to
the corridor. She heard them approach
her chamber, and &s;top at the door; &s;he
heard, al&s;o, the low whi&s;perings of their
voices, as they &s;eemed con&s;ulting on what
was to be done, and &s;he &s;carcely ventured
to draw breath, while &s;he inten&s;ely attend|ed
to them. Not a word, however, di&s;|tinctly
reached her, till, as one of them
<PB N="236" REF="237">
was departing, another called out in a
half-whi&s;per, "It is below on the table,
in my girdle; make ha&s;te." The man
came back, and &s;aid &s;omething in a
lower voice, to which the other replied,
"&s;he &s;leeps," or Ellena was deceived by
the hi&s;&s;ing con&s;onants of &s;ome other
words. He then de&s;cended the &s;tairs;
and in a few minutes &s;he perceived his
comrade al&s;o pa&s;s away from the door; &s;he
li&s;tened to his retreating &s;teps, till the roar|ing
of the &s;ea was alone heard in their
&s;tead.</P>
<P>Ellena's terrors were relieved only for a
moment. Con&s;idering the import of the
words, it appeared that the man who had
de&s;cended, was gone for the &s;tiletto of the
other, &s;uch an in&s;trument being u&s;ually
worn in the girdle, and from the a&s;&s;urance,
"&s;he &s;leeps," he &s;eemed to fear that his
words had been overheard; and &s;he li&s;ten|ed
again for their &s;teps; but they came
no more.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
Happily for Ellena's peace, &s;he knew
not that her chamber had a door, &s;o con|trived
as to open without &s;ound, by which
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins might enter un&s;u&s;pectedly at any
hour of the night. Believing that the in|habitants
of this hou&s;e had now retired to
re&s;t, her hopes and her &s;pirits began to re|vive;
but &s;he was yet &s;leeple&s;s and watch|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ul.
She mea&s;ured the chamber with un|equal
&s;teps, often &s;tarting as the old
boards &s;hook and groaned where &s;he pa&s;|&s;ed;
and often pau&s;ing to li&s;ten whether
all was yet &s;till in the corridor. The
gleam, which a ri&s;ing moon threw between
the bars of her window, now began to
&s;hew many &s;hadowy objects in the cham|ber,
which &s;he did not recollect to have
ob&s;erved while the lamp was there. More
than once, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;omething
glide along towards the place where the
mattre&s;s was laid, and, almo&s;t congealed
with terror, &s;he &s;tood &s;till to watch it;
but the illu&s;ion, if &s;uch it was, di&s;appeared
<PB N="238" REF="239">
where the moon-light faded, and even her
fears could not give &s;hape to it beyond.
Had &s;he not known that her chamber-door
remained &s;trongly barred, &s;he would
have believed this was an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;tealing
to the bed where it might be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he
&s;lept. Even now the thought occurred
to her, and vague as it was, had power to
&s;trike an angui&s;h, almo&s;t deadly, through
her heart, while &s;he con&s;idered that her im|mediate
&s;ituation was nearly as perilous as
the one &s;he had imaged. Again &s;he li&s;tened,
and &s;carcely dared to breathe; but not the
lighte&s;t &s;ound occurred in the pau&s;es of
the waves, and &s;he believed her&s;elf con|vinced
that no per&s;on except her&s;elf was
in the room. That &s;he was deceived in
this belief, appeared from her unwillingne&s;s
to approach the mattre&s;s, while it was yet
involved in &s;hade. Unable to over|come
her reluctance, &s;he took her &s;tation
at the window, till the &s;trengthening rays
&s;hould allow a clearer view of the cham|ber,
<PB N="239" REF="240">
and in &s;ome degree re&s;tore her confi|dence;
and &s;he watched the &s;cene without
as it gradually became vi&s;ible. The moon,
ri&s;ing over the ocean, &s;hewed it's re&s;tle&s;s
&s;urface &s;preading to the wide horizon;
and the waves, which broke in foam upon
the rocky beach below, retiring in long
white lines far upon the waters. She
li&s;tened to their mea&s;ured and &s;olemn
&s;ound, and, &s;omewhat &s;oothed by the &s;oli|tary
grandeur of the view, remained at the
lattice till the moon had ri&s;en high into
the heavens; and even till morning began
to dawn upon the &s;ea, and purple the
ea&s;tern clouds.</P>
<P>Re-a&s;&s;ured, by the light that now per|vaded
her room, &s;he returned to the mat|tre&s;s;
where anxiety at length yielded to
her wearine&s;s, and &s;he obtained a &s;hort
repo&s;e.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLENA was awakened from profound
&s;leep, by a loud noi&s;e at the door of her
chamber; when, &s;tarting from her mat|tre&s;s,
&s;he looked around her with &s;urpri&s;e
and di&s;may, as imperfect recollections or
the pa&s;t began to gather on her mind.
She di&s;tingui&s;hed the undrawing of iron
bars, and then the countenance of Spalatro
at her door, before &s;he had a clear remem|brance
of her &s;ituation&mdash;that &s;he was a
pri&s;oner in a hou&s;e on a lonely &s;hore, and
that this man was her jailor. Such &s;ick|ne&s;s
<PB N="241" REF="242">
of the heart returned with the&s;e con|victions,
&s;uch faintne&s;s and terror, that
unable to &s;upport her trembling frame,
&s;he &s;unk again upon the mattre&s;s, with|out
demanding the rea&s;on of this abrupt
intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I have brought you &s;ome breakfa&s;t,"
&s;aid Spalatro, "if you are awake to take
it; but you &s;eem to be a&s;leep yet. Surely
you have had &s;leep &s;ufficient for one night;
you went to re&s;t &s;oon enough."</P>
<P>Ellena made no reply, but, deeply af|fected
with a &s;en&s;e of her &s;ituation, looked
with be&s;eeching eyes at the man, who ad|vanced,
holding forth an oaten cake and
a ba&s;on of milk. "Where &s;hall I &s;et them?"
&s;aid he, "you mu&s;t needs be
glad of them, &s;ince you had no &s;upper."</P>
<P>Ellena thanked him, and de&s;ired he
would place them on the floor, for there
was neither table nor chair in the room.
As he did this, &s;he was &s;truck with the
expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance, which ex|hibited
<PB N="242" REF="243">
a &s;trange mixture of archne&s;s and
malignity. He &s;eemed congratulating
him&s;elf upon his ingenuity, and anticipa|ting
&s;ome occa&s;ion of triumph; and &s;he
was &s;o much intere&s;ted, that her ob&s;erva|tion
never quitted him while he remained
in the room. As his eyes accidentally met
her's, he turned them away, with the ab|ruptne&s;s
of a per&s;on who is con&s;cious of
evil intentions, and fears le&s;t they &s;hould
be detected; nor once looked up till he
ha&s;tily left the chamber, when &s;he heard
the door &s;ecured as formerly.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion, which his look had
left on her mind, &s;o wholly engaged her
in conjecture, that a con&s;iderable time
elap&s;ed before &s;he remembered that he
had brought the refre&s;hment &s;he &s;o much
required; but, as &s;he now lifted it to her
lips, a horrible &s;u&s;picion arre&s;ted her hand;
it was not, however, before &s;he had &s;wal|lowed
a &s;mall quantity of the milk. The
look of Spalatro, which occa&s;ioned her &s;ur|pri&s;e,
<PB N="243" REF="244">
had accompanied the &s;etting down of
the breakfa&s;t, and it occurred to her, that
poi&s;on was infu&s;ed in this liquid. She
was thus compelled to refu&s;e the &s;u&s;te|nance,
which was become nece&s;&s;ary to her,
for &s;he feared to ta&s;te even of the oaten
cake, &s;ince Spalatro had offered it, but the
little milk &s;he had unwarily taken, was &s;o
very &s;mall that &s;he had no apprehen&s;ion
concerning it.</P>
<P>The day, however, was pa&s;&s;ed in terror,
and almo&s;t in de&s;pondency; &s;he could nei|ther
doubt the purpo&s;e, for which &s;he had
been brought hither, nor di&s;cover any po&s;&s;i|bility
of e&s;caping from her per&s;ecutors; yet
that propen&s;ity to hope, which buoys up
the human heart, even in the &s;evere&s;t hours
of trial, &s;u&s;tained, in &s;ome degree, her
fainting &s;pirits.</P>
<P>During the&s;e mi&s;erable hours of &s;oli|tude
and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the only alleviation to
her &s;uffering aro&s;e from a belief, that Vi|valid
was &s;afe, at lea&s;t from danger, though
<PB N="244" REF="245">
not from grief; but &s;he now under&s;tood
too much of the dexterous contrivances
of the Marche&s;a, his mother, to think it
was practicable for him to e&s;cape from
her de&s;igns, and again re&s;tore her to
liberty.</P>
<P>All day Ellena either leaned again&s;t the
bars of her window, lo&s;t in reverie, while
her uncon&s;cious eyes were fixed upon the
ocean, who&s;e murmurs &s;he no longer
heard; or &s;he li&s;tened for &s;ome &s;ound
from within the hou&s;e, that might a&s;&s;i&s;t
her conjectures, as to the number of
per&s;ons below, or what might be pa&s;|&s;ing
there. The hou&s;e, however, was
profoundly &s;till, except when now and
then a foot&s;tep &s;auntered along a di&s;tant
pa&s;&s;age, or a door was heard to clo&s;e; but
not the hum of a &s;ingle voice aro&s;e from
the lower rooms, nor any &s;ymptom of
there being more than one per&s;on, be&s;ide
her&s;elf, in the dwelling. Though &s;he had
not heard her former guards depart, it
<PB N="245" REF="246">
appeared certain that they were gone, and
that &s;he was left alone in this place with
Spalatro. What could be the purport of
&s;uch a proceeding, Ellena could not ima|gine;
if her death was de&s;igned, it &s;eemed
&s;trange that one per&s;on only &s;hould be left
to the hazard of the deed, when three mu&s;t
have rendered the completion of it certain.
But this &s;urpri&s;e vani&s;hed, when her &s;us&s;|picion
of poi&s;on returned; for it was pro|bable,
that the&s;e men had believed their
&s;cheme to be already nearly accompli&s;hed,
and had abandoned her to die alone, in a
chamber from whence e&s;cape was imprac|ticable,
leaving Spalatro to di&s;po&s;e of her
remains. All the incongruities &s;he had
&s;eparately ob&s;erved in their conduct, &s;eem|ed
now to harmonize and unite in one
plan; and her death, de&s;igned by poi&s;on,
and that poi&s;on to be conveyed in the di&s;|gui&s;e
of nouri&s;hment, appeared to have
been the object of it. Whether it was that
the &s;trength of this conviction affected her
<PB N="246" REF="247">
fancy, or that the cau&s;e was real, Ellena,
remembering at this moment that &s;he
had ta&s;ted the milk, was &s;eized with an
univer&s;al &s;huddering, and thought &s;he
felt that the poi&s;on had been &s;ufficiently
potent to affect her, even in the incon&s;i|derable
quantity &s;he might have taken.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus agitated, &s;he di&s;|tingui&s;hed
foot&s;teps loitering near her door,
and attentively li&s;tening, became con|vinced,
that &s;ome per&s;on was in the corri|dor.
The &s;teps moved &s;oftly, &s;ome|times
&s;topping for an in&s;tant, as if to al|low
time for li&s;tening, and &s;oon after
pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>"It is Spalatro!" &s;aid Ellena; "he be|lieves
that I have taken the poi&s;on, and he
comes to li&s;ten for my dying groans!
Alas! he is only come &s;omewhat too &s;oon,
perhaps!"</P>
<P>As this horrible &s;uppo&s;ition occurred,
the &s;huddering returned with encrea&s;ed
violence, and &s;he &s;unk, almo&s;t fainting, on
<PB N="247" REF="248">
the mattre&s;s; but the fit was not of long
continuance. When it gradually left her,
and recollection revived, &s;he perceived,
however, the prudence of &s;uffering Spala|tro
to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had taken the beve|rage
he brought her, &s;ince &s;uch belief
would at lea&s;t procure &s;ome delay of fur|ther
&s;chemes, and every delay afforded
&s;ome po&s;&s;ibility for hope to re&s;t upon.
Ellena, therefore, poured through the bars
of her window, the milk, which &s;he believed
Spalatro had de&s;igned &s;hould be fatal in its
con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It was evening, when &s;he again fancied
foot&s;teps were lingering near her door, and
the &s;u&s;picion was confirmed, when, on
turning her eyes, &s;he perceived a &s;hade on
the floor, underneath it, as of &s;ome per&s;on
&s;tationed without. Pre&s;ently the &s;hadow
glided away, and at the &s;ame time &s;he
di&s;tingui&s;hed departing &s;teps treading cau|tiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"It is he!" &s;aid Ellena; "he &s;till li&s;tens
for my moans!"</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249">
This further confirmation of his de&s;igns
affected her nearly as much as the fir&s;t;
when anxiou&s;ly turning her looks towards
the corridor, the &s;hadow again appeared
beneath the door, but &s;he heard no &s;tep.
Ellena now watched it with inten&s;e &s;olici|tude
and expectation; fearing every in|&s;tant
that Spalatro would conclude her
doubts by entering the room. "And O!
when he di&s;covers that I live," thought
&s;he, "what may I not expect during the
fir&s;t moments of his di&s;appointment!
What le&s;s than immediate death!"</P>
<P>The &s;hadow, after remaining a few mi|nutes
&s;tationary, moved a little, and then
glided away as before. But it quickly re|turned,
and a low &s;ound followed, as of
&s;ome per&s;on endeavouring to unfa&s;ten
bolts without noi&s;e. Ellena heard one
bar gently undrawn, and then another;
&s;he ob&s;erved the door begin to move, and
then to give way, till it gradually unclo&s;|ed,
and the face of Spalatro pre&s;ented it|&s;elf
<PB N="249" REF="250">
from behind it. Without immediate|ly
entering, he threw a glance round the
chamber, as if he wi&s;hed to a&s;certain &s;ome
circum&s;tance before he ventured further.
His look was more than u&s;ually haggard
as it re&s;ted upon Ellena, who apparently
repo&s;ed on her mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having gazed at her for an in&s;tant, he
ventured towards the bed with quick and
unequal &s;teps; his countenance expre&s;&s;ed
at once impatience, alarm, and the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of guilt. When he was within
a few paces, Ellena rai&s;ed her&s;elf, and he
&s;tarted back as if a &s;udden &s;pectre had
cro&s;&s;ed him. The more than u&s;ual wild|ne&s;s
and wanne&s;s of his looks, with the
whole of his conduct, &s;eemed to confirm
all her former terrors; and, when he rough|ly
a&s;ked her how &s;he did, Ellena had not
&s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to an&s;wer that
&s;he was ill. For &s;ome moments, he re|garded
her with an earne&s;t and &s;ullen at|tention,
and then a &s;ly glance of &s;crutiny,
<PB N="250" REF="251">
which he threw round the chamber, told
her that he was enquiring whether &s;he had
taken the poi&s;on. On perceiving that the
ba&s;on was empty, he lifted it from the
floor, and Ellena fancied a gleam of &s;atis|faction
pa&s;&s;ed over his vi&s;age.</P>
<P>"You have had no dinner." &s;aid he, "I
forgot you; but &s;upper will &s;oon be ready;
and you may walk up the beach till then,
if you will."</P>
<P>Ellena, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed and per|plexed
by this offer of a &s;eeming indul|gence,
knew not whether to accept or re|ject
it. She &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome treachery
lurked within it. The invitation appear|ed
to be only a &s;tratagem to lure her to
de&s;truction, and &s;he determined to decline
accepting it; when again &s;he con&s;idered,
that to accompli&s;h this, it was not nece&s;&s;ary
to withdraw her from the chamber, where
&s;he was already &s;ufficiently in the power of
her per&s;ecutors. Her &s;ituation could not
be more de&s;perate than it was at pre|&s;ent,
<PB N="251" REF="252">
and almo&s;t any change might make it
le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>As &s;he de&s;cended from the corridor, and
pa&s;&s;ed through the lower part of the hou&s;e,
no per&s;on appeared but her conductor;
and &s;he ventured to enquire, whether the
men who had brought her hither were de|parted.
Spalatro did not return an an|&s;wer,
but led the way in &s;ilence to the
court, and, having pa&s;&s;ed the gates, he
pointed toward the we&s;t, and &s;aid &s;he
might walk that way.</P>
<P>Ellena bent her cour&s;e towards the "ma|ny-&s;ounding
waves," followed at a &s;hort di&s;|tance
by Spalatro, and, wrapt in thought,
pur&s;ued the windings of the &s;hore, &s;carce|ly
noticing the objects around her; till,
on pa&s;&s;ing the foot of a rock, &s;he lifted her
eyes to the &s;cene that unfolded beyond,
and ob&s;erved &s;ome huts &s;cattered at a con|&s;iderable
di&s;tance, apparently the re&s;idence
of fi&s;hermen. She could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h
the dark &s;ails of &s;ome &s;kiffs turning the
<PB N="252" REF="253">
cliffs, and entering the little bay, where the
hamlet margined the beach; but, though
&s;he &s;aw the &s;ails lowered, as the boats ap|proached
the &s;hore, they were too far off
to allow the figures of the men to appear.
To Ellena, who had believed that no hu|man
habitation, except her pri&s;on, inter|rupted
the va&s;t &s;olitudes of the&s;e fore&s;ts
and &s;hores, the view of the huts, remote
as they were, imparted a feeble hope, and
even &s;omewhat of joy. She looked back,
to ob&s;erve whether Spalatro was near; he
was already within a few paces; and, ca&s;t|ing
a wi&s;tful glance forward to the remote
cottages, her heart &s;unk again.</P>
<P>It was a lowering evening, and the &s;ea
was dark and &s;welling; the &s;creams of the
&s;ea-birds too, as they wheeled among the
clouds, and &s;ought their high ne&s;ts in the
rocks, &s;eemed to indicate an approaching
&s;torm. Ellena was not &s;o wholly engaged
by &s;elfi&s;h &s;ufferings, but that &s;he could
&s;ympathi&s;e with tho&s;e of others, and
<PB N="253" REF="254">
&s;he rejoiced that the fi&s;herman, who&s;e
boats &s;he had ob&s;erved, had e&s;caped the
threatening tempe&s;t, and were &s;afely &s;hel|tered
in their little homes, where, as they
heard the loud waves break along the
coa&s;t, they could look with keener plea|&s;ure
upon the &s;ocial circle, and the warm
comforts around them. From &s;uch con&s;i|derations
however, &s;he returned again to
a &s;en&s;e of her own forlorn and friendle&s;s
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "I have no longer a
home, a circle to &s;mile welcomes upon
me! I have no longer even one friend to
&s;upport, to re&s;cue me! I&mdash;a mi&s;erable
wanderer on a di&s;tant &s;hore! tracked, per|haps,
by the foot&s;teps of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who
at this in&s;tant eyes his victim with &s;ilent
watchfulne&s;s and awaits the moment of
opportunity to &s;acrifice her!"</P>
<P>Ellena &s;huddered as &s;he &s;aid this, and
turned again to ob&s;erve whether Spalatro
was near. He was not within view; and,
while &s;he wondered, and congratulated
<PB N="254" REF="255">
her&s;elf on a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, &s;he per|ceived
a Monk walking &s;ilently beneath the
dark rocks that overbrowed the beach. His
black garments were folded round him;
his face was inclined towards the ground,
and he had the air of a man in deep medi|tation.</P>
<P>"His, no doubt, are worthy mu&s;ings!"
&s;aid Ellena, as &s;he ob&s;erved him, with
mingled hope and &s;urpri&s;e. "I may ad|dre&s;s
my&s;elf, without fear, to one of his
order. It is probably as much his wi&s;h,
as it is his duty, to &s;uccour the unfortu|nate.
Who could have hoped to find
on this &s;eque&s;tered &s;hore &s;o &s;acred a pro|tector!
his convent cannot be far off."</P>
<P>He approached, his face &s;till bent to|wards
the ground, and Ellena advanced
&s;lowly, and with trembling &s;teps, to meet
him. As he drew near, he viewed her
a&s;kance, without lifting his head; but &s;he
perceived his large eyes looking from un|der
the &s;hade of his cowl, and the upper
<PB N="255" REF="256">
of his peculiar countenance. Her confi|dence
in his protection began to fail, and
&s;he faultered, unable to &s;peak, and &s;carce|ly
daring to meet his eyes. The Monk
&s;talked pa&s;t her in &s;ilence, the lower part
of his vi&s;age &s;till, muffled in his drapery,
and as he pa&s;&s;ed her looked neither with
curio&s;ity, nor &s;urprise.</P>
<P>Ellena pau&s;ed, and determined, when
he &s;hould be at &s;ome di&s;tance, to endea|vour
to make her way to the hamlet, and
throw her&s;elf upon the humanity of it's
inhabitants, rather than &s;olicit the pity of
this forbidding &s;tranger. But in the next
moment &s;he heard a &s;tep behind her, and,
on turning, &s;aw the Monk again approach|ing.
He &s;talked by as before, &s;urveying
her, however, with a &s;ly and &s;crutinizing
glance from the corners of his eyes. His
air and countenance were equally repul&s;ive,
arid &s;till Ellena could not &s;ummon courage
enough to attempt engaging his compa&s;|&s;ion;
but &s;hrunk as from an enemy.
<PB N="256" REF="257">
There was &s;omething al&s;o terrific in the
&s;ilent &s;talk of &s;o gigantic a form; it an|nounced
both power and treachery. He
pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly on to &s;ome di&s;tance, and
di&s;appeared among the rocks.</P>
<P>Ellena turned once more with an in|tention
of ha&s;tening towards the di&s;tant
hamlet, before Spalatro &s;hould ob&s;erve her,
who&s;e &s;trange ab&s;ence &s;he had &s;carcely
time to wonder at; but &s;he had not pro|ceeded
far, when &s;uddenly &s;he perceived
the Monk again at her &s;houlder. She
&s;tarted, and almo&s;t &s;hrieked; while he re|garded
her with more attention than be|fore.
He pau&s;ed a moment, and &s;eemed
to he&s;itate; after which he again pa&s;&s;ed
on in &s;ilence. The di&s;tre&s;s of Ellena en|crea&s;ed;
he was gone the way &s;he had de|&s;igned
to run, and &s;he feared almo&s;t equal|ly
to follow him, and to return to her pri|&s;on.
Pre&s;ently he turned, and pa&s;&s;ed her
again, and Ellena ha&s;tened forward. But,
when fearful of being, pur&s;ued, &s;he again
<PB N="257" REF="258">
looked back, &s;he ob&s;erved him conver|&s;ing
with Spalatro. They appeared to
be in con&s;ultation, while they &s;lowly ad|vanced,
till, probably ob&s;erving her rapid
progre&s;s, Spalatro called on her to &s;top, in
a voice that echoed among all the rocks.
It was a voice, which would not be dis|obeyed.
She looked hopele&s;sly at the &s;till
di&s;tant cottages, and &s;lackened her &s;teps.
Pre&s;ently the Monk again pa&s;&s;ed before
her, and Spalatro had again di&s;appeared.
The frown, with which the former now re|garded
Ellena, was &s;o terrific, that &s;he
&s;hrunk trembling back, though &s;he knew
him not for her per&s;ecutor, &s;ince &s;he had
never con&s;cibu&s;ly &s;een Schedoni. He was
agitated, and his look became darker.</P>
<P>"Whither go you?" &s;aid he in a voice
that was &s;tifled by emotion.</P>
<P>"Who is it, father, that a&s;ks the que&s;|tion?"
&s;aid Ellena, endeavouring to ap|pear
compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Whither go you, and who are you?"
repeated the Monk more &s;ternly.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">
"I am an unhappy orphan," replied
Ellena, &s;ighing deeply, "If you are, as your
habit denotes, a friend to the charities,
you will regard me with compa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent, and then &s;aid&mdash;"Who,
and what is it that you fear?"</P>
<P>"I fear&mdash;even for my life," replied
Ellena, with he&s;itation. She ob&s;erved a
darker &s;hade pa&s;s over his countenance.
"For your life!" &s;aid he, with apparent
&s;urpri&s;e, "who is there that would think
it worth the taking."</P>
<P>Ellena was &s;truck with the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"Poor in&s;ect!" added Schedoni, "who
would cru&s;h thee?"</P>
<P>Ellena made no reply; &s;he remained
with her eyes fixed in amazement upon
his face. There was &s;omething in his
manner of pronouncing this, yet more ex|traordinary
than in the words them&s;elves.
Alarmed by his manner, and awed by the
encrea&s;ing gloom, and &s;welling &s;urge, that
broke in thunder on the beach, &s;he at
<PB N="259" REF="260">
length turned away, and again walked
towards the hamlet which was yet very
remote.</P>
<P>He &s;oon overtook her; when rudely
&s;eizing her arm, and gazing earne&s;tly on
her face, "Who is it, that you fear?" &s;aid
he, "&s;ay who!"</P>
<P>"That is more than I dare &s;ay," replied
Ellena, &s;carcely able to &s;u&s;tain her&s;elf;</P>
<P>"Hah! is it even &s;o!" &s;aid the Monk,
with encrea&s;ing emotion. His vi&s;age how
became &s;o terrible, that Ellena &s;truggled to
liberate her arm, and &s;upplicated that he
would not detain her. He was &s;ilent and
&s;till gazed upon her, but his eyes, when
&s;he had cea&s;ed to &s;truggle, a&s;&s;umed the
fixt and vacant glare of a man, who&s;e
thoughts have retired within them&s;elves,
and who is no longer con&s;cious to &s;ur|rounding
objects.</P>
<P>"I be&s;eech you to relea&s;e me!" re|peated
Ellena, "it is late, and I am far
from home."</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="261">
"That is true," muttered Schedom, &s;till
gra&s;ping her arm, and &s;eeming to reply to
his own thoughts rather than to her words,
&mdash;"that is very true."</P>
<P>"The evening is clo&s;ing fa&s;t," continued
Ellena, "and I &s;hall be overtaken by the
&s;torm."</P>
<P>Schedoni &s;till mu&s;ed, and then mut|tered
&mdash;"The &s;torm, &s;ay you? Why ay,
let it come."</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he &s;uffered her arm to
drop, but &s;till held it, and walked &s;lowly
towards the hou&s;e. Ellena, thus com|pelled
to accompany him, and yet more
alarmed both by his looks, his incoherent
an&s;wers, and his approach to her pri&s;on,
renewed her &s;upplications and her efforts
for liberty, in a voice of piercing di&s;tre&s;s,
adding, "I am far from home, father;
night is coming on. See how the rocks
darken! I am far from home, and &s;hall
be waited for."</P>
<P>"That is fal&s;e!" &s;aid Schedoni, with
empha&s;is; "and you know it to be &s;o."</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">
"Alas! I do," replied Ellena, with
mingled &s;hame and grief, "I have no
friends to wait for me!"</P>
<P>"What do tho&s;e de&s;erve, who delibe|rately
utter fal&s;ehoods," continued the
Monk, "who deceive, and flatter young
men to their de&s;truction?"</P>
<P>"Father!" exclaimed the a&s;toni&s;hed
Ellena.</P>
<P>"Who di&s;turb the peace of families&mdash;who
trepan, with wanton arts, the heirs
of noble hou&s;es&mdash;who&mdash;hah! what do &s;uch
de&s;erve?"</P>
<P>Overcome with a&s;toni&s;hment and terror,
Ellena remained &s;ilent. She now under|&s;tood
that Schedoni, &s;o far from being like|ly
to prove a prote&s;tor, was an agent of her
wor&s;t, and as &s;he had believed her only
enemy; and an apprehen&s;ion of the im|mediate
and terrible vengeance, which
&s;uch an agent &s;eemed willing to accom|pli&s;h,
&s;ubdued her &s;en&s;es; &s;he tottered,
and &s;unk upon the beach. The weight,
<PB N="262" REF="263">
which &s;trained the arm Schedoni held,
called his attention to her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As he gazed upon her helple&s;s and faded
form, he became agitated. He quitted
it, and traver&s;ed the beach in &s;hort turns,
and with ha&s;ty &s;teps; came back again,
and bent over it&mdash;his heart &s;eemed &s;en&s;i|ble
to &s;ome touch of pity. At one mo|ment,
he &s;tepped towards the &s;ea, and
taking water in the hollows of his hands,
threw it upon her face; at another, &s;eem|ing
to regret that he had done &s;o, he
would &s;tamp with &s;udden fury upon the
&s;hore, and walk abruptly to a di&s;tance.
The conflict between his de&s;ign and his con|&s;cience
was &s;trong, or, perhaps, it was only
between his pa&s;&s;ions. He, who had hitherto
been in&s;en&s;ible to every tender feeling, who,
governed by ambition and re&s;entment had
contributed, by his artful in&s;tigations, to
fix the baleful re&s;olution of the Marche&s;a
di Vivaldi, and who was come to execute
her purpo&s;e,&mdash;even he could not now
<PB N="263" REF="264">
look upon the innocent, the wretched
Ellena, without yielding to the momentary
weakne&s;s, as he termed it, of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While he was yet unable to baffle the
new emotion by evil pa&s;&s;ions, he de&s;pi&s;ed
that which conquered him. "And &s;hall
the weakne&s;s of a girl," &s;aid he, "&s;ubdue
the re&s;olution of a man! Shall the view
of her tran&s;ient &s;ufferings unnerve my firm
heart, and compel me to renounce the
lofty plans I have &s;o ardently, &s;o labori|ou&s;ly
imagined, at the very in&s;tant when
they are changing into realities! Am I
awake! Is one &s;park of the fire, which
has &s;o long &s;mouldered within my bo&s;om,
and con&s;umed my peace, alive! Or am
I tame and abject as my fortunes? hah! as
my fortunes! Shall the &s;pirit of my fa|mily
yield for ever to circum&s;tances? The
que&s;tion rou&s;es it, and I feel it's energy
revive within me."</P>
<P>He &s;talked with ha&s;ty &s;teps towards
Ellena, as if he feared to tru&s;t his re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="264" REF="265">
with a &s;econd pau&s;e. He had a dag|ger
concealed beneath his Monk's habit;
as he had al&s;o an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's heart &s;hrouded
by his garments. He had a dagger&mdash;but
he he&s;itated to u&s;e it, the blood which it
might &s;pill, would be ob&s;erved by the pea|&s;ants
of the neighbouring hamlet, and
might lead to a di&s;covery. It would be
&s;afer, he con&s;idered, and ea&s;ier, to lay Elle|na,
&s;en&s;ele&s;s as &s;he was, in the waves; their
coldne&s;s would recal her to life, only at the
moment before they would &s;uffocate her.</P>
<P>As he &s;tooped to lift her, his re&s;olution
faultered again, on beholding her innocent
face, and in that moment &s;he moved.
He &s;tarted back, as if &s;he could have
known his purpo&s;e, and, knowing it, could,
have avenged her&s;elf. The water, which
he had thrown upon her face, had gra|dually
revived her; &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes,
and, on perceiving him, &s;hrieked, and at|tempted
to rife. His re&s;olution was &s;ub|dued,
&s;o tremblingly fearful is guilt in the
<PB N="265" REF="266">
moment when it would execute it's atro|cities.
Overcome with apprehen&s;ions, yet
agitated with &s;hame and indignation
again&s;t him&s;elf for being &s;o, he gazed at
her, for an in&s;tant in &s;ilence, and then ab|ruptly
turned away his eyes and left her.
Ellena li&s;tened to his departing &s;teps, and,
rai&s;ing her&s;elf, ob&s;erved him retiring
among the rocks that led towards the
hou&s;e. A&s;toni&s;hed at his conduct, and &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to find that &s;he was alone, Ellena
renewed all her efforts to &s;u&s;tain her&s;elf, till
&s;he &s;hould reach the hamlet &s;o long the
object of her hopes; but &s;he had pro|ceeded
only, a few paces, when Spalatro
again appeared &s;wiftly approaching. Her
utmo&s;t exertion availed her nothing; her
feeble &s;teps were &s;oon overtaken, and El|lena
perceived her&s;elf again his pri&s;oner.
The look with which &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf,
awakened no pity in Spalatro, who ut|tered
&s;ome taunting je&s;t upon the &s;wiftne&s;s
of her flight, as he led her back to her
<PB N="266" REF="267">
pri&s;on, and proceeded in &s;ullen watchful|ne&s;s.
Once again, then, &s;he entered the
gloomy walls of that fatal man&s;ion, never
more, &s;he now believed, to quit them with
life, a belief, which was &s;trengthened when
&s;he remembered that the Monk, on leav|ing
her, had taken the way hither; for,
though &s;he knew not how to account for
his late forbearance, &s;he could not &s;uppo&s;e
that he would long be merciful. He ap|peared
no more, however, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
to her chamber, where Spalatro left her
again to &s;olitude and terror, and &s;he heard
that fateful door again barred upon her.
When his retreating &s;teps had cea&s;ed to
&s;ound, a &s;tilne&s;s, as of the grave, prevailed
in the hou&s;e; like the dead calm, which
&s;ometimes precedes the horrors of a tem|pe&s;t.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SCHEDONI had returned from the beach
to the hou&s;e, in a &s;tate of perturbation,
that defied the controul of even his own
&s;tern will. On the way thither he met
Spalatro, whom, as he di&s;patched him to
Ellena, he &s;trictly commanded not to ap|proach
his chamber till he &s;hould be
&s;ummoned.</P>
<P>Having reached his apartment, he &s;e|cured
the door, though not any per&s;on,
except him&s;elf, was in the hou&s;e, nor any
one expected, but tho&s;e who he knew
would not dare to intrude upon him.
Had it been po&s;&s;ible to have &s;hut out
all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of him&s;elf, al&s;o, how wil|lingly
<PB N="268" REF="269">
would he have done &s;o! He threw
him&s;elf into a chair, and remained for a
con&s;iderable time motionle&s;s and lo&s;t in
thought, yet the emotions of his mind
were violent and contradictory. At the
very in&s;tant when his heart reproached
him with the crime he had meditated,
he regretted the ambitious views he mu&s;t
relinqui&s;h if he failed to perpetrate it, and
regarded him&s;elf with &s;ome degree of con|tempt
for having hitherto he&s;itated on the
&s;ubject. He con&s;idered the character of
his own mind with a&s;toni&s;hment, for cir|cum&s;tances
had drawn forth traits, of
which, till now, he had no &s;u&s;picion. He
knew not by what doctrine to explain the
incon&s;i&s;tencies, the contradictions, he ex|perienced,
and, perhaps, it was not one of
the lea&s;t that in the&s;e moments of direful
and conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, his rea&s;on could
&s;till look down upon their operations, and
lead him to a cool, though brief examina|tion
of his own nature. But the &s;ubtlety
<PB N="269" REF="270">
of &s;elf-love &s;till eluded his enquiries, and
he did not detect that pride was even at
this in&s;tant of &s;elf-examination, and of cri|tical
import, the ma&s;ter-&s;pring of his mind.
In the earlie&s;t dawn of his character this
pa&s;&s;ion had displayed its predominancy,
whenever occa&s;ion permitted, and it's in|fluence
had led to &s;ome of the chief events
of his life.</P>
<P>The Count di Marinella, for &s;uch had
formerly been the title of the Confe&s;&s;or,
was the younger &s;on of an ancient family,
who re&s;ided in the duchy of Milan, and
near the feet of the Tyrolean Alps, on &s;uch
e&s;tates of their ance&s;tors, as the Italian
wars of a former century had left them.
The portion, which he had received at
the death of his father, was not large, and
Schedoni was not of a di&s;po&s;ition to im|prove
his patrimony by &s;low diligence, or
to &s;ubmit to the re&s;traint and humiliation,
which his narrow finances would have im|po&s;ed.
He di&s;dained to acknowledge an

inferiority of fortune to tho&s;e, with whom
he considered him&s;elf equal in rank; and,
as he was destitute of generous feel|ing,
and of &s;ound judgment, he had not
that loftine&s;s of &s;oul, which is ambitious
of true grandeur. On the contrary, he
was &s;atisfied with an o&s;tentatious di&s;play
of plea&s;ures and of power, and, thoughtle&s;s
of the con&s;equence of di&s;&s;ipation, was con|tented
with the plea&s;ures of the moment, till
his exhau&s;ted re&s;ources compelled him to
pau&s;e, and to reflect. He perceived, too
late for his advantage, that it was nece&s;&s;ary
for him to di&s;po&s;e of part of his e&s;tate, and
to confine him&s;elf to the income of the re|mainder.
Incapable of &s;ubmitting with
grace to the reduction, which his folly
had rendered expedient, he endeavoured
to obtain by cunning, the luxuries that
his prudence had failed to keep, and which
neither his genius or his integrity could
command. He withdrew, however, from
the eyes of his neighbours, unwilling to
<PB N="271" REF="276">
&s;ubmit his altered circum&s;tances to their
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Concerning &s;everal years of his life,
from this period, nothing was generally
known; and, when he was next di&s;covered,
it was in the Spirito Santo convent at
Naples, in the habit of a Monk, and under
the a&s;&s;umed name of Schedoni. His air
and countenance were as much altered as
his way of life; his looks had become
gloomy and &s;evere, and the pride, which
had mingled with the gaiety of their for|mer
expre&s;&s;ion, occa&s;ionally di&s;covered it|&s;elf
under the di&s;gui&s;e of humility, but
more frequently in the au&s;terity of &s;ilence,
and in the barbarity of penance.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who di&s;covered Schedoni,
would not have recollected him, had not
his remarkable eyes fir&s;t fixed his atten|tion,
and then revived remembrance. As
he examined his features, he traced the
faint re&s;emblance of what Marinella had
been, to whom he made him&s;elf known.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="277">
The Confe&s;&s;or affected to have forgotten
his former acquaintance, and a&s;&s;ured him,
that he was mi&s;taken re&s;pecting him&s;elf,
till the &s;trenger &s;o clo&s;ely urged &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances,
that the former was no longer
permitted to di&s;&s;emble. He retired, in
&s;ome emotion, with the &s;tranger, and,
whatever might be the &s;ubject of their con|ference,
he drew from him, before he quit|ted
the convent, a tremendous vow, to
keep &s;ecret from the brotherhood his
knowledge of Schedoni's family, and never
to reveal without tho&s;e walls, that he had
&s;een him. The&s;e reque&s;ts he had urged
in a manner, that at once &s;urpri&s;ed and
awed the &s;tranger, and which at the &s;ame
time that it mani&s;e&s;ted the weight of Sche|doni's
fears, bade the former tremble for
the con&s;equence of di&s;obedience; and he
&s;huddered even while he promi&s;ed to obey.
Of the fir&s;t part of the promi&s;e he was
probably &s;trictly ob&s;ervant; whether he
was equally &s;o of the &s;econd, does not ap|pear;
<PB N="273" REF="278">
it is certain, that after this period,
he was never more &s;een or heard of at
Naples.</P>
<P>Schedoni, ever ambitious of di&s;tinction,
adapted his manners to the views and pre|judices
of the &s;ociety with whom he re&s;id|ed,
and became one of the mo&s;t exact ob|&s;ervers
of their outward forms, and almo&s;t
a prodigy for &s;elf-denial and &s;evere di&s;ci|pline.
He was pointed out by the fathers
of the convent to the juniors as a great
example, who was, however, rather to be
looked up to with reverential admiration,
than with an hope of emulating his &s;ublime
virtues. But with &s;uch panegyrics their
friend&s;hip for Schedoni concluded. They
found it convenient to applaud the au&s;te|rities,
which they declined to practi&s;e; it
procured them a character for &s;anctity,
and &s;aved them the nece&s;&s;ity of earning
it by mortifications of their own; but
they both feared and hated Schedoni for
his pride and his gloomy au&s;terities, too
<PB N="274" REF="279">
much, to gratify his ambition by any thing
further than empty prai&s;e. He had been
&s;everal years in the &s;ociety, without obtain|ing
any con&s;iderable advancement, and with
the mortification of &s;eeing per&s;ons, who
had never emulated his &s;everity, rai&s;ed to
high offices in the church. Somewhat too
late he di&s;covered, that he was not to ex|pect
any &s;ub&s;tantial favour from the bro|therhood,
and then it was that his re&s;tle&s;s
and di&s;appointed &s;pirit fir&s;t &s;ought prefer|ment
by other avenues. He had been
&s;ome years Confe&s;&s;or to the Marche&s;a di
Vivaldi, when the conduct of her &s;on
awakened his hopes, by &s;howing him, that
he might render him&s;elf not only u&s;eful
but nece&s;&s;ary to her, by his councils. It
was his cu&s;tom to &s;tudy the characters of
tho&s;e around him, with a view of adapting
them to his purpo&s;es, and, having a&s;cer|tained
that of the Marche&s;a, the&s;e hopes
were encouraged. He perceived that her
pa&s;&s;ions were &s;trong, her judgment weak,
<PB N="275" REF="280">
and he under&s;tood, that, if circum&s;tances
&s;hould ever enable him to be &s;erviceable in
promoting the end at which any one of
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions might aim, his fortune
would be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>At length, he &s;o completely in&s;inuated
him&s;elf into her confidence, and became
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to her views, that he could de|mand
his own terms, and this he had not
failed to do, though with all the affected de|licacy
and fine&s;&s;e that his &s;ituatio &s;eemed
to require. An office of high dignity in the
church, which had long vainly excited his
ambition, was promi&s;ed him by the Mar|che&s;a,
who had &s;ufficient influence to ob|tain
it; her condition was that of his pre&s;erv|ing
the honour of her family, as &s;he delicately
termed it, which &s;he was careful to make
him under&s;tand could be &s;ecured only by the
death of Ellena. He acknowledged, with
the Marche&s;a, that the death of this fa&s;ci|nating
young woman was the only means of
pre&s;erving that honour, &s;ince, if &s;he lived,
<PB N="276" REF="281">
they had every evil to expect from the at|tachment
and character of Vivaldi, who
would di&s;cover and extricate her from any
place of confinement, however ob&s;cure or
difficult of acce&s;s, to which &s;he might be
conveyed. How long and how arduou&s;ly
the Confe&s;&s;or had aimed to oblige the Mar|che&s;a,
has already appeared. The la&s;t
&s;cene was now arrived, and he was on the
eve of committing that atrocious act,
which was to &s;ecure the pride of her hou&s;e,
and to &s;atisfy at once his ambition and his
de&s;ire of vengeance; when an emotion new
and &s;urpri&s;ing to him, had arre&s;ted his
arm, and compelled his re&s;olution to fal|ter.
But this emotion was tran&s;ient, it
disappeared almo&s;t with the object that
had awakened it; and now, in the &s;ilence
and retirement of his chamber, he had lei|&s;ure
to recollect his thoughts, to review his
&s;chemes, to re-animate his re&s;olution, and
to wonder again at the pity, which had al|mo&s;t
won him from his purpo&s;e. The
<PB N="277" REF="282">
ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his nature once more re|&s;umed
it's authority, and he determined to
earn the honour, which the Marche&s;a had
in &s;tore for him.</P>
<P>After &s;ome cool, and more of tumultuous,
con&s;ideration, he re&s;olved that Ellena &s;hould
be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated that night, while &s;he &s;lept,
and afterwards conveyed through a pa&s;&s;age
of the hou&s;e communicating with the &s;ea,
into which the body might be thrown and
buried, with her &s;ad &s;tory, beneath the
waves. For his own &s;ake, he would have
avoided the danger of &s;hedding blood,
had this appeared ea&s;y; but he had too
much rea&s;on to know &s;he had &s;u&s;picions
of poi&s;on, to tru&s;t to a &s;econd attempt by
&s;uch means; and again his indignation
ro&s;e again&s;t him&s;elf, &s;ince by yielding to a
momentary companion, he had lo&s;t the
opportunity afforded him of throwing her
unre&s;i&s;tingly into the &s;urge.</P>
<P>Spalatro, as has already been hinted,
was a former confident of the Confe&s;&s;or,
<PB N="278" REF="283">
who knew too truly, from experience, that
he could be tru&s;ted, and had, therefore,
engaged him to a&s;&s;i&s;t on this occa&s;ion. To
the hands of this man he con&s;igned the
fete of the unhappy Ellena, him&s;elf recoil|ing
from the horrible act he had willed;
and intending by &s;uch a &s;tep to involve
Spalatro more deeply in the guilt, and
thus more effectually to &s;ecure his &s;ecret.</P>
<P>The night was far advanced before
Schedoni's final re&s;olution was taken, when
he &s;ummoned Spalatro to his chamber to
in&s;truct him in his office. He bolted the
door, by which the man had entered, for|getting
that them&s;elves were the only per|&s;ons
in the hou&s;e, except the poor Ellena,
who, un&s;u&s;picious of what was con&s;piring,
and her &s;pirits worn out by the late &s;cene,
was &s;leeping peacefully on her mattre&s;s
above. Schedoni moved &s;oftly from the
door he had &s;ecured, and, beckoning Spa|latro
to approach, &s;poke in a low voice,
as if he feared to be overheard. "Have
<PB N="279" REF="284">
you perceived any &s;ound from her cham|ber
lately?" &s;aid he, "Does &s;he &s;leep,
think you?"</P>
<P>"No one has moved there for this hour
pa&s;t, at lea&s;t," replied Spalatro, "I have
been watching in the corridor, till you
called, and &s;hould have heard if &s;he had
&s;tirred, the old floor &s;hakes &s;o with every
&s;tep."</P>
<P>"Then hear rue, Spalatro," &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or. "I have tried, and found thee
faithful, or I &s;hould not tru&s;t thee in a bu|&s;ine&s;s
of confidence like this. Recollect
all I &s;aid to thee in the morning, and be
re&s;olute and dexterous, as I have ever
found thee."</P>
<P>Spalatro li&s;tened in gloomy attention,
and the Monk proceeded, "It is late;
go, there&s;ore, to her chamber; be certain
that &s;he &s;leeps. Take this," he added,
"and this," giving him a dagger and a
large cloak&mdash;"You know how you are to
u&s;e them."</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="285">
He pau&s;ed, and fixed his penetrating
eyes on Spalatro, who held up the dagger
in &s;ilence, examined the blade, and conti|nued
to gaze upon it, with a vacant &s;tare,
as if he was uncon&s;cious of what he did.</P>
<P>"You know your bu&s;ine&s;s," repeated
Schedoni, authoritatively, "di&s;patch! time
wears; and I mu&s;t &s;et off early."</P>
<P>The man made no reply.</P>
<P>"The morning dawns already," &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till more urgently, "Do you
faulter? do you tremble? Do I not know
you?"</P>
<P>Spalatro put up the poinard in his bo|&s;om
without &s;peaking, threw the cloak
over his arm, and moved with a loitering
&s;tep towards the door.</P>
<P>"Di&s;patch!" repeated the Confe&s;&s;or,
"why do you linger?"</P>
<P>"I cannot &s;ay I like this bu&s;ine&s;s,
Signor," &s;aid Spalatro &s;urlily. "I know
not why I &s;hould always do the mo&s;t, and
be paid the lea&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="286">
"Sordid villain!" exclaimed Schedoni,
"you are not &s;atisfied then!"</P>
<P>"No more a villain than your&s;elf,
Signor," retorted the man, throwing down
the cloak, "I only do your bu&s;in&s;s; and
'tis you that are &s;ordid, for you would
take all the reward, and I would only have
a poor man have his dues. Do the work
your&s;elf, or give me the greater profit."</P>
<P>"Peace!" &s;aid Schedoni, "dare no
more to in&s;ult me with the mention of
reward. Do you imagine I have &s;old
my&s;elf! 'Tis my will that &s;he dies;
this is &s;ufficient; and for you&mdash;the price
you have a&s;ked has been granted."</P>
<P>"It is too little," replied Spalatro, and
be&s;ides, I do not like the work.&mdash;What
harm has &s;he done me?"</P>
<P>"Since when is it, that you have taken
upon you to moralize?" &s;aid the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
"and how long are the&s;e cowardly
&s;cruples to la&s;t? This is not the fir&s;t
time you have been employed; what harm
<PB N="282" REF="287">
had others done you! You forget that I
know you, you forget the pa&s;t."</P>
<P>"No, Signer, I remember it too well, I
wi&s;h I could forget; I remember it too
well.&mdash;I have never been at peace &s;ince.
The bloody hand is always before me!
and often of a night, when the &s;ea roars,
and &s;torms &s;hake the hou&s;e, <HI>they</HI> have
come, all ga&s;ned as I left them, and &s;tood
before my bed! I have got up, and ran
out upon the &s;hore for &s;afety!"</P>
<P>"Peace!" repeated the Confe&s;&s;or,
"where is this frenzy of fear to end? To
what are the&s;e vi&s;ions, painted in blood, to
lead? I thought I was talking with a
man, but find I am &s;peaking only to a
baby, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with his nur&s;e's dreams!
Yet I under&s;tand you,&mdash;you &s;hall be
&s;atisfied."</P>
<P>Schedoni, however, had for once mi&s;un|der&s;tood
this man, when he could not be|lieve
it po&s;&s;ible that he was really aver&s;e to
execute what he had undertaken. Whe|ther
<PB N="283" REF="288">
the innocence and beauty of Ellena
had &s;oftened his heart, or that his con|&s;cience
did torture him for his pa&s;t deeds,
he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to murder her.
His con&s;cience, or his pity, was of a very
peculiar kind however; for, though he re|fu&s;ed
to execute the deed him&s;elf, he con|&s;ented
to wait at the foot of a back &s;tair-ca&s;e,
that communicated with Ellena's chamber,
while Schedoni accomplished it, and after|ward
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying the body to the
&s;hore. "This is a compromi&s;e between
con&s;cience and guilt, worthy of a demons,"
muttered Schedoni, who appeared to be
in&s;en&s;ible that he had made the &s;ame com|promi&s;e
with him&s;elf not an hour before;
and who&s;e extreme reluctance at this mo|ment,
to perpetrate with his own hand,
what he had willingly de&s;igned for ano|ther,
ought to have reminded him of that
compromi&s;e.</P>
<P>Spalatro, relea&s;ed from the immediate
office of an executioner, endured &s;ilently
<PB N="284" REF="289">
the abu&s;ive, yet half-&s;tifled, indignation
of the Confe&s;&s;or, who al&s;o bade him re|member,
that, though he now &s;hrunk from
the mo&s;t active part of this tran&s;action, he
had not always been re&s;tained, in offices of
the &s;ame nature, by equal compunction;
and that not only his means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
but his very life it&s;elf, was at his mercy.
Spalatro readily acknowledged that it was
&s;o; and Schedoni knew, too well, the
truth of what he had urged, to be re|&s;trained
from his purpo&s;e, by any appre|hen&s;ion
of the con&s;equence of a di&s;covery
from this ruffian.</P>
<P>"Give me the dagger, then," &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or, after a long pau&s;e, "take up the
cloak, and follow to the &s;tair-cafe. Let me
&s;ee, whether your valour will carry you
thus far."</P>
<P>Spalatro re&s;igned the &s;tiletto, and threw
the cloak again over his arm. The Con|fe&s;&s;or
&s;tepped to the door, and, trying to
open it, "It is fa&s;tened!" &s;aid he in alarm,
<PB N="285" REF="290">
"&s;ome per&s;on has got into the hou&s;e,&mdash;it
is fa&s;tened!"</P>
<P>"That well may be, Signor," replied
Spalatro, calmly, "for I &s;aw you bolt it
your&s;elf, after I came into the room."</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid Schedoni, recovering
him&s;elf; "that is true."</P>
<P>He opened it, and proceeded along the
&s;ilent pa&s;&s;ages, towards the private &s;tair|ca&s;e,
often pau&s;ing to li&s;ten, and then
&s;tepping more lightly;&mdash;the terrific Sche|doni,
in this moment of meditative guilt,
feared even the feeble Ellena. At the
foot of the &s;tair-cafe, he again &s;topped to
li&s;ten. "Do you hear any thing?" &s;aid
he in a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>"I hear only the &s;ea," replied the man.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! it is &s;omething more!" &s;aid
Schedoni; "that is the murmur of
voices!"</P>
<P>They were &s;ilent. After a pau&s;e of
&s;ome length, "It is, perhaps, the voice of
the &s;pectres I told you of, Signor," &s;aid
<PB N="286" REF="291">
Spalatro, with a &s;neer. "Give me the
dagger," &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>Spalatro, in&s;tead of obeying, now gra&s;p|ed
the arm of the Confe&s;&s;or, who, looking
at him for an explanation of this extraor|dinary
action, was &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed to
ob&s;erve the palene&s;s and horror of his coun|tenance.
His &s;tarting eyes &s;eemed to fol|low
&s;ome object along the pa&s;&s;age, and
Schedoni, who began to partake of his feek|ings,
looked forward to di&s;cover what oc|ca&s;ioned
this di&s;may, but could not per|ceive
any thing that ju&s;tified it. "What
is it you fear?" &s;aid he at length.</P>
<P>Spalatro's eyes were &s;till moving in hor|ror,
"Do you &s;ee nothing!" &s;aid he point|ing.
Schedoni looked again, but did not
di&s;tingui&s;h any object: in the remote gloom
of the pa&s;&s;age, whither Spalatro's &s;ight was
now fixed.</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid he, a&s;hamed of
his own weakne&s;s, "this is not a moment
for &s;uch fancies. Awake from this idle
dream."</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="292">
Spalatro withdrew his eyes, but they
retained all their wildne&s;s. "It was no
dream," &s;aid lie, in the voice of a man
who is exhau&s;ted by pain, and begins to
breathe &s;omewhat more freely again. "I
&s;aw it as plainly as I now &s;ee you."</P>
<P>"Dotard! what did you &s;ee!" enquir|ed
the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"It came before my eyes in a mo|ment,
and &s;hewed it&s;elf di&s;tinctly and out|&s;pread."</P>
<P>"What &s;hewed it&s;elf?" repeated Sche|doni.</P>
<P>"And then it beckoned&mdash;yes, it beck|oned
me, with that blood-&s;tained finger!
and glided away down the pa&s;&s;age, &s;tilll
beckoning&mdash;till it was lo&s;t in the dark|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>"This is very frenzy!" &s;aid Schedoni,
exce&s;&s;ively agitated. "Arou&s;e your&s;elf,
and be a man!"</P>
<P>"Frenzy! would it were, Signor. I
&s;aw that dreadful hand&mdash;I &s;ee it now&mdash;it
is there again!&mdash;there!"</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="293">
Schedoni, &s;hocked, embarra&s;&s;ed, and
once more infected with the &s;trange emo|tions
of Spalatro, looked forward expect|ing
to di&s;cover &s;ome terrific object, but &s;till
nothing was vi&s;ible to him, and he &s;oon
recovered him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to endeavour
to appea&s;e the fancy of this conscience|&s;truck
ruffian. But Spalatro was in&s;en|&s;ible
to all he could urge, and the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
fearing that his voice, though weak
and &s;tifled, would awaken Ellena, tried to
withdraw him from the &s;pot, to the apart|ment
they had quitted.</P>
<P>"The wealth of San Loretto &s;hould not
make me go that way. Signor," replied he,
&s;huddering&mdash;"that was the way <HI>it.</HI> beck|oned,
it vani&s;hed that way!"</P>
<P>Every emotion now yielded with Sche|doni,
to that of apprehen&s;ion le&s;t Ellena,
being awakened, &s;hould make his ta&s;k
more horrid by a &s;truggle, and his embar|ra&s;&s;ment
encrea&s;ed at each in&s;tant, for nei|ther
command, menace, or entreaty could
<PB N="289" REF="294">
prevail with Spalatro to retire, till the Monk
luckily remembered a door, which opened
beyond the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and would conduct
them by another way to the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide of the hou&s;e. The man con&s;ented
&s;o to depart, when, Schedoni unlock|ing
a &s;uit of rooms, of which he had
always kept the keys, they pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence
through an extent of de&s;olate chambers,
till they reached the one, which they had
lately left.</P>
<P>Here, relieved from apprehen&s;ion re|&s;pecting
Ellena, the Confe&s;&s;or expo&s;tulat|ed
more freely with Spalatro, but neither
argument or menace could prevail, and the
man per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to return to the
&s;tair-ca&s;e, though prote&s;ting, at the &s;ame
time, that he would not remain alone in
any part of the hou&s;e; till the wine, with
which the Confe&s;&s;or abundantly &s;upplied
him, began to overcome the terrors of his
imagination. At length, his courage was
&s;o much re-animated, that he con&s;ented to
re&s;ume his &s;tation, and await at the foot
<PB N="290" REF="295">
of the &s;tairs the accompli&s;hment of Sche|doni's
dreadful errand, with which agree|ment
they returned thither by the way they
had lately pa&s;&s;ed. The wine, with which
Schedoni al&s;o had found it nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;trengrhen his own re&s;olution, did not &s;e|cure
him from &s;evere emotion, when he
found him&s;elf again near Ellena; but he
made a &s;trenuous effort for &s;elf-&s;ubjec|tion,
as he demanded the dagger of Spa|latro.</P>
<P>"You have it already, Signor," replied
the man.</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid the Monk; "a&s;cend
&s;oftly, or our &s;teps may awaken her."</P>
<P>"You &s;aid I was to wait at the foot of
the &s;tairs, Signor, while you"&mdash;</P>
<P>"True, true, true!" muttered the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
and had begun to a&s;cend, when his
attendant de&s;ired him to &s;top. "You
are going in darkne&s;s, Signor, you have
forgotten the lamp. I have another
here."</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="296">
Schedoni took it angrily, without &s;peak|ing,
and was again a&s;cending, when he he|&s;itated,
and once more pau&s;ed. "The
glare will di&s;turb her," thought he, "it is
better to go in darkne&s;s.&mdash;Yet&mdash;". He
con&s;idered, that he could not &s;trike with
certainty without light to direct his hand,
and he kept the lamp, but returned once
more to charge Spalatro not to &s;tir from
the foot of the &s;tairs till he called, and
to a&s;cend to the chamber upon the fir&s;t
&s;ignal.</P>
<P>"I will obey, Signor, if you, on your
part, will promi&s;e not to give the &s;ignal
till all is over."</P>
<P>"I do promi&s;e," replied Schedoni. "No
more!"</P>
<P>Again he, a&s;cended, nor &s;topped till he
reached Ellena's door, where he li&s;tened
for a &s;ound; but all was as &s;ilent as if
death already reigned in the chamber.
This door was, from long di&s;u&s;e, difficult
to be opened; formerly it would have
<PB N="292" REF="297">
yielded without &s;ound, but now Schedoni
was fearful of noi&s;e from every effort he
made to move it. After &s;ome difficulty,
however, it gave way, and he perceived,
by the &s;tilne&s;s within the apartment, that
he had not di&s;turbed Ellena. He &s;haded
the lamp with the door for a moment,
while he threw an enquiring glance for|ward,
and when he did venture farther,
held part of his dark drapery before the
light, to prevent the rays from &s;preading
through the room.</P>
<P>As he approached the bed, her gentle
breathings informed him that &s;he &s;till
&s;lept, and the next moment he was at her
&s;ide. She lay in deep and peaceful &s;lum|ber,
and &s;eemed to have thrown her&s;elf
upon the mattre&s;s, after having been wea|ried
by her griefs; for, though &s;leep pre&s;|&s;ed
heavily on her eyes, their lids were yet
wet with tears.</P>
<P>While Schedoni gazed for a moment
upon her innocent countenance, a faint
<PB N="293" REF="298">
&s;mile &s;tole over it. He &s;tepped back. "She
&s;miles in her murderer's face!" &s;aid he,
&s;huddering, "I mu&s;t be &s;peedy."</P>
<P>He &s;earched for the dagger, and it was
&s;ome time before his trembling hand could
di&s;engage it from the folds of his garment;
but, having done &s;o, he again drew near,
and prepared to &s;trike. Her dre&s;s perplex|ed
him; it would interrupt the blow, and
he &s;tooped to examine whether he could
turn her robe a&s;ide, without waking her.
As the light pa&s;&s;ed over her face, he per|ceived
that the &s;mile had vani&s;hed&mdash;the
vi&s;ions of her &s;leep were changed, for tears
&s;tole from beneath her eye-lids, and her
features &s;uffered a &s;light convul&s;ion. She
&s;poke! Schedoni, apprehending that the
light had di&s;turbed her, &s;uddenly drew
back, and, again irre&s;olute, &s;haded the
lamp, and concealed him&s;elf behind the
curtain, while he li&s;tened. But her words
were inward and indi&s;tinct, and con|vinced
him that &s;he &s;till &s;lumbered.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="299">
His agitation and repugnance to &s;trike
encrea&s;ed with every moment of delay, and,
as often as he prepared to plunge the poi|nard
in her bo&s;om, a &s;huddering horror
re&s;trained him. A&s;toni&s;hed at his own
feelings, and indignant at what he termed
a da&s;tardly weakne&s;s, he found it nece&s;&s;ary
to argue with him&s;elf, and his rapid
thoughts &s;aid, "Do I not feel the nece&s;&s;ity
of this act! Does not what is dearer to
me than exi&s;tence&mdash;does not my con&s;e|quence
depend on the execution of it? Is
&s;he not al&s;o beloved by the young Vival|di?&mdash;have
I already forgotten the church
of the Spirito Santo?" This con&s;ideration
re-animated him; vengeance nerved his
arm, and drawing a&s;ide the lawn from her
bo&s;om, he once more rai&s;ed it to &s;trike;
when, a&s;ter gazing for an in&s;lant, &s;ome new
cau&s;e of horror &s;eemed to &s;eize all his frame,
aud he &s;tood for &s;ome moments agha&s;t
and motionle&s;s like a &s;tatue. His re&s;pi|ration
was &s;hort and laborious, chilly drops
<PB N="295" REF="300">
&s;tood on his forehead, and all his faculties
of mind &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended. When he re|covered,
he &s;tooped to examine again the
miniature, which had occa&s;ioned this revo|lution,
and which had lain concealed be|neath
the lawn that he withdrew. The
terrible certainty was almo&s;t confirmed,
and forgetting, in his impatience to know
the truth, the imprudence of &s;uddenly di&s;|covering
him&s;elf to Ellena at this hour of
the night and with a dagger at his feet,
he called loudly "Awake! awake! Say,
what is your name? Speak! &s;peak quick|ly!"</P>
<P>Ellena, arou&s;ed by a man's voice, &s;tart|ed
from her mattre&s;s, when, perceiving
Schedoni, and by the pale glare of the
lamp, his haggard countenance, &s;he &s;hriek|ed,
and &s;unk back on the pillow. She had
not fainted; and believing that he came
to murder her, &s;he now exerted her&s;elf to
plead for mercy. The energy of her feelings
enabled her to ri&s;e and throw her&s;elf at
<PB N="296" REF="301">
his feet, "Be merciful, O father! be merci|ful!"
&s;aid &s;he, in a trembling voice.</P>
<P>"Father!" interrupted Schedoni, with
earne&s;tne&s;s; and then, &s;eeming to re&s;train
him&s;elf, he added, with unaffected &s;ur|pri&s;e,"
Why are you thus terrified?" for he
had lo&s;t, in new intere&s;ts and emotions, all
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil intention, and of the
&s;ingularity of his &s;ituation. "What do
you fear?" he repeated.</P>
<P>"Have pity, holy father!" exclaimed
Ellena in agony.</P>
<P>"Why do you not &s;ay who&s;e portrait
that is?" demanded he, forgetting that
he had not a&s;ked the que&s;tion before.</P>
<P>"Who&s;e portrait!" repeated the Con|fe&s;&s;or
in a loud voice.</P>
<P>"Who&s;e portrait!" &s;aid Ellena, with
extreme &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Ay, how came you by it? Be quick
&mdash;who&s;e re&s;emblance is it?"</P>
<P>"Why &s;hould you wi&s;h to know?"
&s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="302">
"An&s;wer my que&s;tion," repeated Sche|doni,
with encrea&s;ing &s;ternne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I cannot part with it, holy father,"
replied Ellena, pre&s;&s;ing it to her bo&s;om,
"you do not wi&s;h me to part with
it!"</P>
<P>"Is it impo&s;&s;ible to make you an&s;wer my
que&s;tion!" &s;aid he, in extreme perturba|tion,
and turning away from her, "has
fear utterly confounded you!" Then,
again &s;tepping towards her, and &s;eizing
her wri&s;t, he repeated the demand in a
tone of de&s;peration.</P>
<P>"Alas! he is dead! or I &s;hould not now
want a protector," replied Ellena, &s;hrink|ing
from his gra&s;p, and weeping.</P>
<P>"You trifle," &s;aid Schedoni, with a
terrible look, "I once more demand an
an&s;wer&mdash;who&s;e picture?"&mdash;</P>
<P>Ellena lifted it, gazed upon it for a
moment, and then pre&s;&s;ing it to her lips
&s;aid, "This was my father."</P>
<P>"Your father!" he repeated in an inward
<PB N="298" REF="303">
voice, "your father!" and &s;huddering,
turned away.</P>
<P>Ellena looked at him with &s;urpri&s;e.
"I never knew a father's care," &s;he &s;aid,
"nor till lately did I perceive the want of
it.&mdash;But now."&mdash;</P>
<P>"His name?" interrupted the Con|fe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"But now" continued Ellena&mdash;"if you
are not as a father to me&mdash;to whom can I
look for protection?"</P>
<P>"His name? "repeated Schedoni, with
&s;terner empha&s;is.</P>
<P>"It is &s;acred," replied Ellena, "for he
was unfortunate!"</P>
<P>"His name?" demanded the Confe&s;&s;or,
furiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"I have promi&s;ed to conceal it, father."</P>
<P>"On your life, I charge you tell it;
remember, on your life!"</P>
<P>Ellena trembled, was &s;ilent, and with
&s;upplicating looks implored him to de&s;i&s;t
from enquiry, but he urged the que&s;tion
<PB N="299" REF="304">
more irre&s;i&s;tibly. "His name, then," &s;aid
&s;he, "was Marinella."</P>
<P>Schedoni groaned and turned away;
but in a few &s;econds, &s;truggling to com|mand
the agitation that &s;hattered his
whole frame, he returned to Ellena, and
rai&s;ed her from her knees, on which &s;he
had thrown her&s;elf to implore mercy.</P>
<P>"The place of his re&s;idence?" &s;aid; the
Monk.</P>
<P>"It was far from hence," &s;he replied; but
he demanded an unequivocal an&s;wer, and
&s;he reluctantly gave one.</P>
<P>Schedoni turned away as before, groan|ed
heavily, and paced the chamber with|out
&s;peaking; while Ellena, in her turn,
enquired the motive of his que&s;tions, and
the occa&s;ion of his agitation. But he
&s;eemed not to notice any thing &s;he &s;aid
and, wholly given up to his feelings, was
inflexibly &s;ilent, while he &s;talked, with
mea&s;ured &s;teps, along the room, and his
face, half hid by his cowl, was bent towards
the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="305">
Ellena's terror began to yield to a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
and this emotion encrea&s;ed, when,
Schedoni approaching her, &s;he perceived
tears &s;well in his eyes, which were fixt on
her's, and his countenance &s;often from the
wild di&s;order that had marked it. Still
he could not &s;peak. At length he yielded
to the fulne&s;s of his heart, and Schedoni,
the &s;tern Schedoni, wept and &s;ighed!
He &s;eated him&s;elf on the mattre&s;s be&s;ide
Ellena, took her hand, which &s;he af|frighted
attempted to withdraw, and
when he could command his voice, &s;aid,
"Unhappy child!&mdash;behold your more
unhappy father!" As he concluded, his
voice was overcome by groans, and he drew
the cowl entirely over his face.</P>
<P>"My father!" exclaimed the a&s;toni&s;hed
and doubting Ellena&mdash;"my father!" and
fixed her eyes upon him. He gave no
reply, but when, a moment after, he lifted
his head, "Why do you reproach me with
tho&s;e looks!" &s;aid the con&s;cious Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="306">
"Reproach you!&mdash;reproach my fa|ther!"
repeated Ellena, in accents &s;often|ing
into tenderne&s;s, <HI>Why</HI> &s;hould I reproach
my father!"</P>
<P>"<HI>Why!</HI>". exclaimed Schedoni, &s;tarting
from his feat, "Great God!"</P>
<P>As he moved, he &s;tumbled over the
dagger at his foot; at that moment it
might be &s;aid to &s;trike into his heart. He
pu&s;hed it ha&s;tily from &s;ight. Ellena had
not ob&s;erved it; but &s;he ob&s;erved his la|bouring
brea&s;t, his di&s;tracted looks, and
quick &s;teps, as he walked to and fro in the
chamber; and &s;he a&s;ked, with the mo&s;t
&s;oothing accents of compa&s;&s;ion, and looks
of anxious gentlene&s;s, what made him &s;o
unhappy, and tried to a&s;&s;uage his &s;uffer|ings.
They &s;eemed to encrea&s;e with every
wi&s;h &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to di&s;pel them; at one
moment he would pau&s;e to gaze upon her,
and in the next would quit her with a
frenzied &s;tart.</P>
<P>"Why do you look &s;o piteou&s;ly upon
<PB N="302" REF="307">
me, father?" Ellena &s;aid, "why are you
&s;o unhappy? Tell me, that I may com|fort
you."</P>
<P>This appeal renewed all the violence of
remor&s;e and grief, and he pre&s;&s;ed her to his
bo&s;om, and wetted her cheek with his
tears. Ellena wept to &s;ee him weep, till
her doubts began to take alarm. What|ever
might be the proofs, that had con|vinced
Schedoni of the relation&s;hip be|tween
them, he had not explained the&s;e to
her, and, however &s;trong was the eloquence
of nature which &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, it was not
&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify an entire confidence in
the a&s;&s;ertion he had made, or to allow her
to permit his care&s;&s;es without trembling.
She &s;hrunk, and endeavoured to di&s;engage
her&s;elf; when, immediately under&s;tanding
her, he &s;aid, "Can you doubt the cau&s;e of
the&s;e emotions? the&s;e &s;igns of paternal
affection?"</P>
<P>"Have I not rea&s;on to doubt," replied
Ellena, timidly, "&s;ince I never witne&s;&s;ed
them before?"</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="308">
He withdrew his arms, and, fixing his
eyes earne&s;tly on hers, regarded her for
&s;ome moments in expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence
"Poor Innocent!" &s;aid he, at length,
"you know not how much your words
convey!&mdash;It is too true, you never
have known a father's tenderne&s;s till
now!"</P>
<P>His countenance darkened while he
&s;poke, and he ro&s;e again from his &s;eat.
Ellena, meanwhile, a&s;toni&s;hed, terrified
and oppre&s;&s;ed by a variety of emotions,
had no power to demand his rea&s;ons for
the belief that &s;o much agitated him, or
any explanation of his conduct; but &s;he
appealed to the portrait, and endeavoured,
by tracing &s;ome re&s;emblance between it
and Schedoni, to decide her doubts.
The countenance of each was as diffe|rent
in character as in years. The mi|niature
di&s;played a young man rather
hand&s;ome, of a gay and &s;miling coun|tenance;
yet the &s;mile expre&s;&s;ed triumph,
<PB N="304" REF="309">
rather than &s;weetne&s;s, and his whole air
and features were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of &s;uperiority that role even to
haughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>Schedoni, on the contrary, advanced in
years, exhibited a &s;evere phy&s;iognomy,
furrowed by thought, no le&s;s than by
time, and darkened by the habitual in|dulgence
of moro&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. He looked
as if he had never &s;miled &s;ince the por|trait
was drawn; and it &s;eemed as if the
painter, prophetic of Schedoni's future
di&s;po&s;ition, had arre&s;ted and embodied
that &s;mile, to prove hereafter that cheer|fulne&s;s
had once played upon his fea|tures.</P>
<P>Though the expre&s;&s;ion was &s;o different
between the countenance, which Schedoni
formerly owned, and that he now wore,
the &s;ame character of haughty pride was
vi&s;ible in both; and Ellena did trace a
re&s;emblance in the bold outline of the
features, but not &s;ufficient to convince
<PB N="305" REF="310">
her, without farther evidence, that each
belonged to the &s;ame per&s;on, and that
the Confe&s;&s;or had ever been the young
cavalier in the portrait. In the fir&s;t
tumult of her thoughts, &s;he had not had
lei&s;ure to dwell upon the &s;ingularity of
Schedoni's vi&s;iting her at this deep hour
of the night, or to urge any que&s;tions, ex|cept
vague ones, concerning the truth of
her relation&s;hip to him. But now, that
her mind was &s;omewhat recollected, and
that his looks were le&s;s terrific, &s;he ven|tured
to a&s;k a fuller explanation of the&s;e
circum&s;tances, and his rea&s;ons for the
late extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion. "It is pa&s;t
midnight, father," &s;aid Ellena, "you
may judge then how anxious I am to
learn, what motive led you to my cham|ber
at this lonely hour?"</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply.</P>
<P>"Did you come to warn me of
danger?" &s;he continued, "had you dis|covered
the cruel de&s;igns of Spalatro?</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="311">
Ah! when I &s;upplicated for your com|pa&s;&s;ion
on the &s;hore this evening, you
little thought what perils &s;urrounded
me! or you would&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You &s;ay true!" interrupted he, in
a hurried manner, "but name the &s;ub|ject
no more. Why will you per&s;i&s;t in
returning to it?"</P>
<P>His words &s;urprized Ellena, who had
not even alluded to the &s;ubject till now;
but the returning wildne&s;s of his coun|tenance,
made her fearful of dwelling
upon the topic, even &s;o far as to point
out his error.</P>
<P>Another deep pau&s;e &s;ucceeded, during
which Schedoni continued to pace the
room, &s;ometimes &s;topping for an in&s;tant,
to fix his eyes on Ellena, and regarding
her with an earne&s;tne&s;s that &s;eemed to
partake of frenzy, and then gloomily
withdrawing his regards, and &s;ighing
heavily, as he turned away to a di&s;tant
part of the room. She, meanwhile, agi|tated
<PB N="307" REF="312">
with a&s;toni&s;hment at his conduct,
as well as at her own circum&s;tances, and
with the fear of offending him by further
que&s;tions, endeavoured to &s;ummon courage
to &s;olicit the explanation which was &s;o
important to her tranquillity. At length
&s;he a&s;ked, how &s;he might venture to be|lieve
a circum&s;tance &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, as that
of which he had ju&s;t a&s;&s;ured her, and to
remind him that he had not yet di&s;clo&s;ed
his rea&s;on for admitting the belief.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or's feelings were eloquent
in reply; and, when at length they were
&s;ufficiently &s;ubdued, to permit him to
talk coherently, he mentioned &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances
concerning Ellena's family,
that proved him at lea&s;t to have been
intimately acquainted with it; and others,
which &s;he believed were known only to
Bianchi and her&s;elf, that removed every
doubt of his identity.</P>
<P>This, however, was a period of his
life too big with remor&s;e, horror, and
<PB N="308" REF="313">
the fir&s;t pangs of parental affection, to
allow him to conver&s;e long; deep &s;oli|tude
was nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;oul. He
wi&s;hed to plunge where no eye might
re&s;train his emotions, or ob&s;erve the
overflowing angui&s;h of his heart. Hav|ing
obtained &s;ufficient proof to convince
him that Ellena was indeed his child,
and a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he &s;hould be re|moved
from this hou&s;e on the follo|ing
day, and be re&s;tored to her home,
he abruptly left the chamber.</P>
<P>As he de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, Spa|latro
&s;tepped forward to meet him, with
the cloak which had been de&s;igned to
wrap the mangled form of Ellena, when
it &s;hould be carried to the &s;hore. "Is
it done?" &s;aid the ruffian, in a &s;tifled
voice, "I am ready;" and he &s;pread
forth the cloak, and began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>"Hold! villain, hold!" &s;aid Schedoni,
lifting up his head for the fir&s;t time,
"Dare to enter that chamber, and your
life &s;hill an&s;wer for it."</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="314">
"What!" exclaimed the-man, &s;hrink|ing
back a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;"will not <HI>her</HI>'s &s;a|tisfy
you!"</P>
<P>He trembled for the con&s;equence of
what he had &s;aid, when he ob&s;erved the
changing countenance of the Confe&s;&s;or.
But Schedoni &s;poke not: the tumult in
his brea&s;t was too great for utterance, and
he pre&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily forward. Spalatro fol|lowed.
"Be plea&s;ed to tell me what I
am to do," &s;aid he, again holding forth the
cloak.</P>
<P>"Avaunt!" exclaimed the other, turn|ing
fiercely upon him; "leave me."</P>
<P>"How!" &s;aid the man, who&s;e &s;pirit was
now arou&s;ed, "has <HI>your</HI> courage failed too,
Signor? If &s;o, I will prove my&s;elf no da&s;|tard,
though you called me one; I'll do
the bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Villain! fiend!" cried Schedoni, &s;eiz|ing
the ruffian by the throat, with a gra&s;p
that &s;eemed intended to annihilate him;
when, recollecting that the fellow was only
<PB N="310" REF="315">
willing to obey the very in&s;tructions he
had him&s;elf but lately delivered to him,
other emotions &s;ucceeded to that of rage;
he &s;lowly liberated him, and in accents
broken, and &s;oftening from &s;ternne&s;s, bade
him retire to re&s;t. "Tomorrow," he ad|ded,
"I will &s;peak further with you. As
for this night&mdash;I have changed my pur|po&s;e.
Begone!"</P>
<P>Spalatro was about to expre&s;s the in|dignation,
which a&s;toni&s;hment and fear had
hitherto, overcome, but his employer re|peated
his command in a voice of thun|der,
and clo&s;ed the door of his apartment
with violence, as he &s;hut out a man, who&s;e
pre&s;ence was become hateful to him. He
felt relieved by his ab&s;ence, and began to
breathe more freely, till, remembering that
this accomplice had ju&s;t boa&s;ted that he
was no da&s;tard, he dreaded le&s;t, by way of
proving the a&s;&s;ertion, he &s;hould attempt
to commit the crime, from which he had
lately &s;hrunk. Terrified at the po&s;&s;ibili|ty,
<PB N="311" REF="316">
and even apprehending that it might
already have become a reality, he ru&s;hed
from the room, and found Spalatro in the
pa&s;&s;age leading to the private &s;tair-ca&s;e;
but, whatever might have been his pur|po&s;e,
the &s;ituation and looks of the latter
were &s;ufficiently alarming. At the ap|proach
of Schedoni, he turned his &s;ullen
and malignant countenance towards him,
without an&s;wering the call, or the demand
as to his bu&s;ine&s;s there; and with &s;low
&s;teps obeyed the order of his ma&s;ter, that
he &s;hould withdraw to his room. Thither
Schedoni followed, and, having locked him
in it for the night, he repaired to the apart|ment
of Ellena, which he &s;ecured from the
po&s;&s;ibility of intru&s;ion. He then returned
to his own, not to &s;leep, but to abandon
him&s;elf to the agonies of remor&s;e and hor|ror;
and he yet &s;huddered like a man, who
has ju&s;t recoiled from the brink of a pre|cipice,
but who &s;till mea&s;ures the gulf with
his eye.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLENA, when Schedoni had left her,
recollected all the particulars, which he
had thought proper to reveal concerning
her family, and, comparing them with &s;uch
circum&s;tances as the late Bianchi had re|lated
on the &s;ame &s;ubject, &s;he perceived
nothing that was contradictory between the
two accounts. But &s;he knew not even yet
enough of her own &s;tory, to under&s;tand
why Bianchi had been &s;ilent as to &s;ome
particulars, which had ju&s;t been di&s;clo&s;ed.
From Bianchi &s;he had always under&s;tood,
that her mother had married a nobleman
of the duchy of Milan, and of the hou&s;e of
<PB N="313" REF="318">
Marinella; that the marriage had been
unfortunate; and that &s;he her&s;elf, even
before the death of the Counte&s;s, had been
committed to the care of Bianchi, the only
&s;i&s;ter of that lady. Of this event, or of
her mother, Ellena had no remembrance;
for the kindne&s;s of Bianchi had obliterated
from her mind the lo&s;s and the griefs of
her early infancy; and &s;he recollected
only the accident which had di&s;covered
to her, in Bianchi's cabinet, after the
death of the latter, the miniature and
the name of her father. When &s;he had
enquired the rea&s;on of this injunc|tion,
Bianchi replied, that the degrad|ed
fortune of her hou&s;e rendered pri|vacy
de&s;irable; and an&s;wered her fur|ther
que&s;tions concerning her father, by
relating, that he had died while &s;he was
an infant. The picture, which Ellena
had di&s;covered, Bianchi had found among
the trinkets of the departed Counte&s;s, and
<PB N="314" REF="319">
de&s;igned to pre&s;ent it at &s;ome future pe|riod
to. Ellena, when her di&s;cretion might
be tru&s;ted with a knowledge of her family.
This was the whole of what Signora Bian|chi
had judged it nece&s;&s;ary to explain,
though in her la&s;t hours it appeared that
&s;he wi&s;hed to reveal more; but it was
then too late.</P>
<P>Though Ellena perceived that many
circum&s;tances of the relations given by
Schedoni, and by Signora Bianchi, coin|cided,
and that none were contradictory,
except that of his death, &s;he could not yet
&s;ubdue her amazement at this di&s;covery,
or even the doubts which occasionally re|curred
to her as to it's truth. Schedoni,
on the contrary, had not even appeared
&s;urpri&s;ed, when &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he
always under&s;tood her father had been
dead many years; though when &s;he a&s;ked
if her mother too was living, both his di&s;|tre&s;s
and his a&s;&s;urances confirmed the rela|tion
made by Bianchi.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="320">
When Ellena's mind became more tran|quil,
&s;he noticed again the &s;ingularity of
Schedoni's vi&s;it to her apartment at &s;o &s;a|cred
an hour; and her thoughts glanced
back involuntarily to the &s;cene of the pre|ceding
evening on the &s;ea-&s;hore, and the
image of her father appeared in each, in
the terrific character of an agent of the
Marche&s;a di Vivaldi. The &s;u&s;picions,
however, which &s;he had formerly admit|ted,
re&s;pecting his de&s;igns, were new impa|tiently
rejected, for &s;he was le&s;s anxious to
di&s;cover truth, than to relea&s;e her&s;elf from
horrible &s;uppo&s;itions; and &s;he willingly
believed that Schedoni, having mi&s;under|&s;tood
her character, had only de&s;igned to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing her beyond the reach of
Vivaldi. The ingenuity of hope &s;ugge&s;ted
al&s;o, that, having ju&s;t heard from her con|ductors,
or from Spalatro, &s;ome circum|&s;tances
of her &s;tory, he had been led to a
&s;u&s;picion of the relation&s;hip between them,
<PB N="316" REF="321">
and that in the fir&s;t impatience of paren|tal
anxiety, he had di&s;regarded the hour,
and come, though at midnight, to her
apartment to a&s;certain the truth.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;oothed her&s;elf with this ex|planation
of a circum&s;tance, which had oc|ca&s;ioned
her con&s;iderable &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he per|ceived
on the floor the point of a dagger
peeping from beneath the curtains! Emo|tions
almo&s;t too horrible to be &s;u&s;tained,
followed this di&s;covery; &s;he took the in|&s;trument,
and gazed upon it agha&s;t and
trembling, for a &s;u&s;picion of the real mo|tive
of Schedoni's vi&s;it glanced upon her
mind. But it was only for a moment; &s;uch
a &s;uppo&s;ition was too terrible to be willing|ly
endured; &s;he again believed that Spa|latro
alone had meditated her de&s;truction,
and &s;he thanked the Confe&s;&s;or as her deli|verer,
in&s;tead of &s;hrinking from him as an
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. She now under&s;tood that Sche|doni,
having di&s;covered the ruffian's de&s;ign,
<PB N="317" REF="322">
had ru&s;hed into the chamber to &s;ave a
&s;tranger from his murderous poniard, and
had uncon&s;ciou&s;ly re&s;cued his own daugh|ter,
when the portrait at her bo&s;om in|formed
him of the truth. With this
conviction Ellena's eyes overflowed with
gratitude, and her heart was hu&s;hed to peace.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, &s;hut up in his
chamber, was agitated by feelings of a ve|ry
oppo&s;ite nature. When their fir&s;t ex|ce&s;s
was exhau&s;ted, and his mind was
calm enough to reflect, the images that
appeared on it &s;truck him with &s;olemn
wonder. In pur&s;uing Ellena at the crimi|nal
in&s;tigation of the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi,
it appeared that he had been per&s;ecuting
his own child; and in thus con&s;enting to
con&s;pire again&s;t the innocent, he had in the
event been only puni&s;hing the guilty, and
preparing mortification for him&s;elf on the
exact &s;ubject to which he had &s;acrificed
his con&s;cience. Every &s;tep that he had
<PB N="318" REF="323">
taken with a view of gratifying his ambi|tion
was retrograde, and while he had been
wickedly intent to &s;erve the Marche&s;a and
him&s;elf, by preventing the marriage of
Vivaldi and Ellena, he had been laborious&s;|ly
counteracting his own fortune. An alli|ance
with the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Vivaldi,
was above his loftie&s;t hope of advance|ment,
and this event he had him&s;elf nearly
prevented by the very means which had
been adoped, at the expence of every vir|tuous
con&s;ideration, to obtain an infe|rior
promotion. Thus by a &s;ingular re|tribution,
his own crimes had recoiled
upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Schedoni perceived the many ob&s;tacles,
which lay between him and his newly
awakened hopes, and that much was to be
overcome before tho&s;e nuptials could be
publicly &s;olemnized, which he was now
&s;till more anxious to promote, than he
had lately been to prevent. The appro|bation
of the Marche&s;a was, at lea&s;t, de&s;ir|able,
<PB N="319" REF="324">
for &s;he had much at her di&s;po&s;al, and
without it, though his daughter might be
the wife of Vivaldi, he him&s;elf would be no
otherwi&s;e benefited at pre&s;ent than by the
honour of the connection. He had &s;ome
peculiar rea&s;ons for believing, that her con|&s;ent
might be obtained, and, though there
was hazard in delaying the nuptials till
&s;uch an experiment had been made, he re|&s;olved
to encounter it, rather than forbear
to &s;olicit her concurrence. But, if the
Marche&s;a &s;hould prove inexorable, he de|termined
to be&s;tow the hand of Ellena,
without her knowledge, and in doing &s;o,
he well knew that he incurred little dan|ger
from her re&s;entment, &s;ince he had &s;e|crets
in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
which mu&s;t awe her into a &s;peedy neutrali|ty.
The con&s;ent of the Marche&s;e, as he
de&s;paired of obtaining it, he did not mean
to &s;olicit, and the influence of the Mar|che&s;a
was &s;uch, that Schedoni did not re|gard
that as e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="325">
The fir&s;t &s;teps, however, to be taken,
were tho&s;e that might relea&s;e Vivaldi from
the Inqui&s;ition, the tremendous pri&s;on in|to
which Schedoni him&s;elf, little fore&s;eeing
that he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon wi&s;h for his libera|tion,
had cau&s;ed him to be thrown. He
had always under&s;toood, indeed, that if
the Informer forbore to appear again&s;t the
Accu&s;ed in this Court, the latter would
of cour&s;e be liberated; and he al&s;o believ|ed,
that Vivaldi's freedom could be ob|tained
whenever he &s;hould think proper to
apply to a per&s;on at Naples, whom he
knew to be connected with the <HI>Holy Office</HI>
of Rome. How much the Confe&s;&s;or had
&s;uffered his wi&s;hes to deceive him, may ap|pear
hereafter. His motives for having
thus confined Vivaldi, were partly tho&s;e
of &s;elf-defence. He dreaded the di&s;covery
and the vengeance, which might follow the
lo&s;s of Ellena, &s;hould Vivaldi be at liberty
immediately to pur&s;ue his enquiries. But
he believed that all trace of her mu&s;t be
<PB N="321" REF="326">
lo&s;t, after a few weeks had elap&s;ed, and
that Vivaldi's &s;ufferings from confinement
in the Inqui&s;ition would have given inte|re&s;ts
to his mind, which mu&s;t weaken the
one he felt for Ellena. Yet, though in
this in&s;tance &s;elf-defence had been a prin|cipal
motive with Schedoni, a de&s;ire of
revenging the in&s;ult he had received in
the church of the Spirito Santo, and all
the con&s;equent mortifications he expe|rienced,
had been a &s;econd; and, &s;uch was
the blackne&s;s of his hatred, and the avarice
of his revenge, that he had not con&s;idered
the &s;uffering, which the lo&s;s of Ellena would
occa&s;ion Vivaldi, as &s;ufficient retaliation.</P>
<P>In adopting a mode of puni&s;hment &s;o
extraordinary as that of impri&s;onment in
the Inqui&s;ition, it appears, therefore, that
Schedoni was influenced, partly by the dif|ficulty
of otherwi&s;e confining Vivaldi, du|ring
the period for which confinement was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of his
own &s;chemes, and partly by a de&s;ire of in|flicting
<PB N="322" REF="327">
the tortures of terror. He had
al&s;o been encouraged by his di&s;covery of
this opportunity for conferring new obli|gations
on the Marche&s;a. The very con|duct,
that mu&s;t have appeared to the fir&s;t
glance of an hone&s;t mind fatal to his in|tere&s;ts,
he thought might be rendered
beneficial to them, and that his dexterity
could &s;o command the bu&s;ine&s;s, as that the
Marche&s;a &s;hould eventually thank him
as the deliverer of her &s;on, in&s;tead of di&s;|covering
and execrating him as his Accu|&s;er;
a &s;cheme favoured by the unju&s;t and
cruel rule enacted by the tribunal he ap|proached,
which permitted anonymous In|formers.</P>
<P>To procure the arre&s;tation of Vivaldi, it
had been only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a written
accu&s;ation, without a name, to the <HI>Holy
Office,</HI> with a mention of the place where
the accu&s;ed per&s;on might be &s;eized; but
the &s;uffering in con&s;equence of this did
not always proceed further than the <HI>que&s;|tion;.</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="328">
&s;ince, if the Informer failed to disco|ver
him&s;elf to the Inqui&s;itors, the pri&s;oner,
after many examinations, was relea&s;ed,
unle&s;s he happened unwarily to criminate
him&s;elf. Schedoni, as he did not intend
to pro&s;ecute, believed, therefore, that
Vivaldi would of cour&s;e be di&s;charged
after a certain period, and &s;uppo&s;ing it
al&s;o utterly impo&s;&s;ible that he could
ever di&s;cover his Accu&s;er, the Confe&s;&s;or
determined to appear anxious and active
in effecting his relea&s;e. This character of
a deliverer, he knew he &s;hould be the bet|ter
enabled to &s;upport by means of a per|&s;on
officially connected with the <HI>Holy Of|fice,</HI>
who had already uncon&s;ciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted
his views. In the apartment of this man,
Schedoni had accidentally &s;een a formula
of arre&s;tation again&s;t a per&s;on &s;u&s;pected of
Here&s;y, the view of which had not only
&s;ugge&s;ted to him the plan he had &s;ince
adopted, but had in &s;ome degree a&s;&s;i&s;ted
him to carry it into effect. He had &s;een
<PB N="324" REF="329">
the &s;croll only for a &s;hort time, but his
ob&s;ervations were &s;o minute, and his me|mory
&s;o clear, that he was able to copy
it with at lea&s;t &s;ufficient exactne&s;s to impo&s;e
upon the Benedictine prie&s;t, who had,
perhaps, &s;eldom or never &s;een a real in|&s;trument
of this kind. Schedoni had em|ployed
this artifice for the purpo&s;e of im|mediately
&s;ecuring Vivaldi, apprehending
that, while the Inqui&s;itors were &s;lowly de|liberating
upon his arre&s;t, he might quit
Celano, and elude di&s;covery. If the de|caption
&s;ucceeded, it would enable him
al&s;o to &s;eize Ellena, and to mi&s;lead Vivaldi
re&s;pecting her de&s;tination. The charge of having
carried off a nun might appear to
be corroborated by many circum&s;tances,
and Schedoni would probably have made
the&s;e the &s;ubject of real denunciation, had
he not fore&s;een the danger and the trouble
in which it might implicate him&s;elf; and
that, as the charge could not be &s;ubstan|tiated,
Ellena would finally e&s;cape. As
<PB N="325" REF="330">
far as his plan now went, it had been &s;uc|ce&s;sful;
&s;ome of the bravoes whom he
hired to per&s;onate officials, had conveyed
Vivaldi to the town, where the real officers
of the Inqui&s;ition were appointed to re|ceive
him; while the others carried Ellena
to the &s;hore of the Adriatic. Schedoni
had much applauded his own ingenuity, in
thus contriving, by the matter of the
forged accu&s;ation, to throw an impene|trable
veil over the fate of Ellena, and to
&s;ecure him&s;elf from the &s;u&s;picions or ven|geance
of Vivaldi, who, it appeared, would
always believe that &s;he had died, or was
&s;till confined in the un&s;earchable pri&s;ons
of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Thus he had betrayed him&s;elf in endea|vouring
to betray Vivaldi, who&s;e relea&s;e,
however, he yet &s;uppo&s;ed could be ea&s;ily
obtained; but how much his policy
had, in this in&s;tance, outrun his &s;agacity,
now remained to be proved.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of Schedoni's immediate
<PB N="326" REF="331">
perplexity was, the difficulty of convey|ing
Ellena back to Naples; &s;ince, not chu&s;|ing
to appear at pre&s;ent in the character
of her father, he could not decorou&s;ly
accompany her thither him&s;elf, nor could
he prudently entru&s;t her to the conduct
of any per&s;on, whom he knew in this neigh|bourhood.
It was, however, nece&s;&s;ary to
form a &s;peedy determination, for he could
neither endure to pa&s;s another day in a
&s;cene, which mu&s;t continually impre&s;s him
with the horrors of the preceding night,
nor that Ellena &s;hould remain in it; and
the morning light already gleamed upon
his ca&s;ements.</P>
<P>After &s;ome further deliberation, he re|&s;olved
to be him&s;elf her conductor, as far
at lea&s;t as through the fore&s;ts of the Garga|nus,
and at the fir&s;t town where conve|niencies
could be procured, to throw a&s;ide
his Monk's habit, and, a&s;&s;uming the dre&s;s
of a layman, accompany her in this di&s;|gui&s;e
towards Naples, till he &s;hould either
<PB N="327" REF="332">
di&s;cover &s;ome &s;ecure means of &s;ending her
forward to that city, or a temporary a&s;y|lum
for her in a convent on the way.</P>
<P>His mind was &s;carcely more tranquil,
after having formed this determination,
than before, and he did not attempt to
repo&s;e him&s;elf even for a moment. The
circum&s;tances of the late di&s;covery were
almo&s;t perpetually recurring to his af|frighted
con&s;cience, accompanied by a
fear that Ellena might &s;u&s;pect the real
purpo&s;e of his midnight vi&s;it; and he
alternately formed and rejected plau&s;ible
fal&s;ehoods, that might a&s;&s;uage her curio|&s;ity,
and delude her apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The hour arrived, however, when it
was nece&s;&s;ary to prepare for departure,
and found him &s;till undecided as to the
explanation he &s;hould form.</P>
<P>Having relea&s;ed Spalatro from his
chamber, and given him directions to
procure hor&s;es and a guide immediately
from the neighbouring hamlet, he re|paired
<PB N="328" REF="333">
to Ellena's room, to prepare her
for this ha&s;ty removal. On approaching
it, a remembrance of the purpo&s;e, with
which he had la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages and &s;tair-ca&s;e, appealed &s;o
powerfully to his feelings, that he was
unable to proceed, and he turned back
to his own apartment to recover &s;ome
command over him&s;elf. A few moments
re&s;tored to him his u&s;ual addre&s;s, though
not his tranquillity, and he again ap|proached
the chamber; it was now, how|ever,
by way of the corridor. As he un|barred
the door, his hand trembled; but,
when he entered the room, his counte|nance
and manner had re&s;umed their u&s;ual
&s;olemnity, and his voice only would have
betrayed, to an attentive ob&s;erver, the agi|tation
of his mind.</P>
<P>Ellena was con&s;iderably affected on
&s;eeing him again, and he examined with
a jealous eye the emotions he witne&s;&s;ed.
The &s;mile with which &s;he met him was
<PB N="329" REF="334">
tender, but he perceived it pa&s;s away
from her features, like the a&euml;rial colouring
that illumines a mountain's brow; and
the gloom of doubt and apprehen&s;ion again
over&s;pread them. As he advanced, he held
forth his hand for her's, when, &s;uddenly per|ceiving
the dagger he had left in the cham|ber,
he involuntarily withdrew his prof|fered
courte&s;y, and his countenance chang|ed.
Ellena, who&s;e eyes followed his to the
object that attracted them, pointed to the
in&s;trument, took it up, and approaching
him &s;aid, "This dagger I found la&s;t
night in my chamber! O my father!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"That dagger!" &s;aid Schedoni, with
affected &s;urprize.</P>
<P>"Examine it," continued Ellena, while
&s;he held it up, "Do you know to whom
it belongs? and who brought it hither?"</P>
<P>"What is it you mean?" a&s;ked Sche|doni,
betrayed by his feelings.</P>
<P>"Do you know, too, for what pur|po&s;e
<PB N="330" REF="335">
it was brought?" &s;aid Ellena mourn|fully.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or made no reply, but irre|&s;olutely
attempted to &s;eize the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>"O yes, I perceive you know too
well," continued Ellena, "here, my
father, while I &s;lept"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Give me the dagger," interrupted
Schedoni, in a frightful voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, my father, I will give it as an
offering of my gratitude," replied Ellena,
but as &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, filled with
tears, his look and fixed attitude terrified
her, and &s;he added with a &s;till more per&s;ua|&s;ive
tenderne&s;s, "Will you not accept the
offering of your child, for having pre&s;erved
her from the poniard of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in?"</P>
<P>Schedoni's looks became yet darker;
he took the dagger in &s;ilence, and threw
it with violence to the furthe&s;t end of
the chamber, while his eyes remained
fixed on her's. The force of the action
<PB N="331" REF="336">
alarmed her; "Yes, it is in vain that
you would conceal the truth," &s;he added,
weeping unre&s;trainedly, "your goodne&s;s
cannot avail; I know the whole."&mdash;</P>
<P>The la&s;t words arou&s;ed Schedoni again
from his trance, his features became con|vul&s;ed,
and his look furious."What
do you know?" he demanded in a
&s;ubdued voice, that &s;eemed ready to
bur&s;t in thunder.</P>
<P>"All that I owe you," replied Ellena,
"that la&s;t night, while I &s;lept upon this
mattre&s;s, un&s;u&s;picious of what was de|&s;igned
again&s;t me, an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in entered the
chamber with that in&s;trument in his
hand, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>A &s;ti&s;led groan from Schedoni checked
Ellena; &s;he ob&s;erved his rolling eyes, and
trembled; till, believing that his agitation
was occa&s;ioned by indignation again&s;t the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;he re&s;umed, "Why &s;hould you
think it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal the danger
which has threatened me, &s;ince it is to you
<PB N="332" REF="337">
that I owe my deliverance from it? O!
my father, do not deny me the plea&s;ure
of &s;hedding the&s;e tears of gratitude, do
not refu&s;e the thanks, which are due to
you! While I &s;lept upon that couch,
while a ruffian &s;tole upon my &s;lumber&mdash;it
was you, yes! can I ever forget that
it was my father, who &s;aved me from his
poniard!"</P>
<P>Schedoni's pa&s;&s;ions were changed, but
they were not le&s;s violent; he could
&s;carcely controul them, while he &s;aid in
a tremulous tone&mdash;"It is enough, &s;ay
no more;" and he rai&s;ed Ellena, but
turned away without embracing her.</P>
<P>His &s;trong emotion, as he paced in
&s;ilence the furthe&s;t end of the apartment,
excited her &s;urprize, but &s;he then attri|buted
it to a remembrance, of the peri|lous
moment, from which he had re&s;cued
her.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, to whom her
thanks were daggers, was trying to &s;ub|due
<PB N="333" REF="338">
he feelings of remor&s;e that tore his
heart; and was &s;o enveloped in a world
of his own, as to be for &s;ome time un|con&s;cious
of all around him. He con|tinued
to &s;talk in gloomy &s;ilence along
the chamber, till the voice of Ellena,
entreating him rather to rejoice that he
had been permitted to &s;ave her, than &s;o
deeply to con&s;ider dangers which were pa&s;t,
again touched the chord that vibrated to
his con&s;cience, and recalled him to a
&s;en&s;e of his &s;ituation. He then bade her
prepare for immediate departure, and
abruptly quitted the room.</P>
<P>Vainly hoping that in flying from the
&s;cene of his meditated crime, he &s;hould
leave with it the acutene&s;s of remem|brance,
and the agonizing &s;tings of re|mor&s;e,
he was now more anxious than
ever to leave this place. Yet he &s;hould
&s;till be accompanied by Ellena, and her
innocent looks, her affectionate thanks,
inflicted an angui&s;h, which was &s;carcely
<PB N="334" REF="339">
endurable. Sometimes, thinking that her
hatred, or what to him would be &s;till
&s;everer, her contempt, mu&s;t be more
tolerable than this gratitude, he almo&s;t
re&s;olved to undeceive her re&s;pecting his
conduct, but as con&s;tantly and impa|tiently
repelled the thought with horror,
and finally determined to &s;uffer her to
account for his late extraordinary vi&s;it in
the way &s;he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Spalatro, at length, returned from the
hamlet with hor&s;es, but without having
procured a guide to conduct the tra|vellers
through a tract of the long-devolving
fore&s;ts of the Garganus, which
it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to pa&s;s. No
per&s;on had been willing to undertake &s;o
arduous a ta&s;k; and Spalatro, who was
well acquainted with all the labyrinths
of the way, now offered his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Schedoni, though he could &s;carcely
endure the pre&s;ence of this man, had no
alternative but to accept him, &s;ince he
<PB N="335" REF="340">
had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the guide who had con|ducted
him hither. Of per&s;onal violence
Schedoni had no apprehen&s;ion, though he
too well under&s;tood the villainy of his pro|po&s;ed
companion; for he con&s;idered that
he him&s;elf &s;hould be well armed, and he
determined to a&s;certain that Spalatro was
without weapons; he knew al&s;o, that in
ca&s;e of a conte&s;t, his own &s;uperior &s;tature
would ea&s;ily enable him to overcome &s;uch
an antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Every thing being now ready for de|parture,
Ellena was &s;ummoned, and the
Confe&s;&s;or led her to his own apartment,
where a &s;light breakfa&s;t was prepared.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits being revived by the &s;peed
of this departure, &s;he would again have
expre&s;&s;ed her thanks, but he peremptorily
interrupted her, and forbade any further
mention of gratitude.</P>
<P>On entering the court where the hor&s;es
were in waiting, and perceiving Spalatro,
Ellena &s;hrunk and put her arm within
<PB N="336" REF="341">
Schedoni's for protection. "What recol|lections
does the pre&s;ence of that man re|vive!"
&s;aid &s;he, "I can &s;carcely venture to
believe my&s;elf &s;afe, even with you, when he
is here."</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply, till the remark
was repeated, "You have nothing to fear
from him," muttered the Confe&s;&s;or, while
he ha&s;tened her forward, "and we have
no time to lo&s;e in vague apprehen&s;ion."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Ellena, "is not
he the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in from whom you &s;aved me!
I cannot doubt, that you know him to be
&s;uch, though you would &s;pare me the
pain of believing &s;o."</P>
<P>"Well, well, be it &s;o," replied the Con|fe&s;&s;or;
"Spalatro, lead the hor&s;es this way."</P>
<P>The party were &s;oon mounted, when,
quitting this eventful man&s;ion, and the
those of the Adriatic, as Ellena hoped for
ever, they entered upon the gloomy wil|derne&s;s
of the Garganus. She often turn|ed
her eyes back upon the hou&s;e with
<PB N="326" REF="342">
emotions of inexpre&s;&s;ible awe, a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
and thankfulne&s;s, and gazed while
a glimp&s;e of it's turretted walls could be
caught beyond the dark branches, which,
clo&s;ing over it, at length &s;hut it from her
view. The joy of this departure, however,
was con&s;iderably abated by the pre&s;ence
of Spalatro, and her fearful countenance
enquired of Schedoni the meaning of his
being &s;uffered to accompany them. The
Confe&s;&s;or was reluctant to &s;peak con|cerning
a man, of who&s;e very exi&s;tence he
would willingly have cea&s;ed to think. El|lena
guided her hor&s;e &s;till clo&s;er to Sche|doni's,
but, forbearing to urge the enquiry
otherwi&s;e than by looks, &s;he received no
reply, and endeavoured to quiet her appre|hen&s;ions,
by con&s;idering that he would
not have permitted this man to be
their guide, unle&s;s he had believed he
might be tru&s;ted. This con&s;ideration,
though it relieved her fears, encrea&s;ed her
perplexity re&s;pecting the late de&s;igns
<PB N="338" REF="343">
of Spalatro, and her &s;urpri&s;e that Sche|doni,
if he had really under&s;tood them to
be evil, &s;hould endure his pre&s;ence.
Every time &s;he &s;tole a glance at the dark
countenance of this man, rendered &s;till
barker by the &s;hade of the trees, &s;he
thought "a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in" was written in each
line or it, and could &s;carcely doubt that
he, and not the people who had conducted
her to the man&s;ion, had dropped the dag|ger
in her chamber. Whenever &s;he looked
round through the deep glades, and on the
fore&s;t-mountains that on every &s;ide clo&s;ed
the &s;cene, and &s;eemed to exclude all cheer|ful
haunt of man, and then regarded her
companions, her heart &s;unk, notwith|&s;tanding
the rea&s;ons &s;he had for believing
her&s;elf in the protection of a father. Nay,
the very looks of Schedoni him&s;elf, more
than once reminding her of his appearance
on the &s;ea-&s;hore, renewed the impre&s;&s;ions
of alarm and even of di&s;may, which &s;he
had there experienced. At &s;uch moments
<PB N="339" REF="344">
it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for her to con&s;ider
him as her parent, and, in &s;pite of every
late appearance, &s;trange and unaccounta|ble
doubts began to gather on her mind.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, lo&s;t in thought,
broke not, by a &s;ingle word, the deep
&s;ilence of the &s;olitudes through which they
pa&s;&s;ed. Spalatro was equally mute, and
equally engaged by his reflections on the
&s;udden change in Schedoni's purpo&s;e, and
by wonder as to the motive, which could
have induced him to lead Ellena in &s;afety,
from the very &s;pot whither &s;he was
brought by his expre&s;s command to be
de&s;troyed. He, however, was not &s;o
wholly occupied, as to be unmindful of
his &s;ituation, or unwatchful of an oppor|tunity
of &s;erving his own intere&s;ts, and re|taliating
upon Schedoni for the treatment
he had received on the preceding night.</P>
<P>Among the various &s;ubjects that di&s;|tracted
the Confe&s;&s;or, the difficulty of
di&s;po&s;ing of Ellena, without betraying at
<PB N="340" REF="345">
Naples that &s;he was his relative, was not
the lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. Whatever might be
the rea&s;on which could ju&s;tify &s;uch feelings,
his fears of a premature di&s;covery of the
circum&s;tance to the &s;ociety with whom
he lived, were &s;o &s;trong, as often to
produce the mo&s;t violent effect upon his
countenance, and it was, perhaps, when
he was occupied by this &s;ubject, that it's
terrific expre&s;&s;ion revived with Ellena the
late &s;cene upon the &s;hore. His embar|ra&s;&s;ment
was not le&s;s, as to the excu&s;e to
be offered the Marche&s;a, for having failed to
fulfil his engagement, and re&s;pecting
the means by which he might intere&s;t her in
favour of Ellena, and even di&s;po&s;e her to
approve the marriage, before &s;he &s;hould
be informed of the family of this unfortu|nate
young woman. Perceiving all the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
for a&s;certaining the probabilities of
&s;uch con&s;ent, before he ventured to make
an avowal of her origin, he determined not
to reveal him&s;elf till he &s;hould be perfectly
<PB N="341" REF="346">
&s;ure that the di&s;covery would be accepta|ble
to the Marche&s;a. In the mean time,
as it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething
of Ellena's birth, he meant to declare, that
he had di&s;covered it to be noble, and her
family worthy, in every re&s;pect, of a con|nection
with that of the Vivaldi.</P>
<P>An interview with the Marche&s;a, was
almo&s;t equally wi&s;hed for and dreaded by
the Confe&s;&s;or. He &s;huddered at the ex|pectation
of meeting a woman, who had
in&s;tigated him to the murder of his own
child, which, though he had been happily
prevented from committing it, was an act
that would &s;till be wi&s;hed for by the
Marche&s;a. How could he endure her
reproaches, when &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover that
he had failed to accompli&s;h her will! How
conceal the indignation of a father, and
di&s;&s;imulate all a father's various feelings,
when, in reply to &s;uch reproaches, he mu&s;t
form excu&s;es, and act humility, from
which his whole &s;oul would revolt! Ne|ver
<PB N="342" REF="347">
could his arts of di&s;&s;imilation have
been &s;o &s;everely tried, not even in the late
&s;cenes with Ellena, never have returned
upon him&s;elf in puni&s;hment &s;o &s;evere, as
in that which awaited him with the Mar|che&s;a.
And from it's approach, the cool
and politic Schedoni often &s;hrunk in &s;uch
horror, that he almo&s;t determined to avoid
it at any hazard, and &s;ecretly to unite Vi|valdi
and Ellena, without even &s;oliciting
the con&s;ent of the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire, however, of the immediate
preferment, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his pride, con|&s;tantly
checked this &s;cheme, and finally
made him willing to &s;ubject every hone&s;t
feeling, and &s;ubmit to any meanne&s;s,
however vicious, rather than forego the
favourite object of his erroneous ambition.
Never, perhaps, was the paradoxical union
of pride and abjectne&s;s, more &s;trongly ex|hibited
than on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>While thus the travellers &s;ilently proceed|ed,
Ellena's thoughts often turned to Vi|valdi,
<PB N="343" REF="348">
and &s;he con&s;idered, with trembling
anxiety, the effect which the late di&s;covery
was likely to have upon their future lives.
It appeared to her, that Schedoni mu&s;t
approve of a connection thus flattering to
the pride of a father, though he would pro|bably
refu&s;e his con&s;ent to a private mar|riage.
And, when &s;he further con&s;idered
the revolution, which a knowledge of her
family might occa&s;ion towards her&s;elf in the
minds of the Vivaldi, her pro&s;pects &s;eemed
to brighten, and her cares began to di&s;&s;i|pate.
Judging that Schedoni mu&s;t be
acquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of
Vivaldi, &s;he was continually on the point
of mentioning him, but was as con&s;tantly
re&s;trained by timidity, though, had &s;he
&s;u&s;pected him to be an inhabitant
of the Inqui&s;ition, her &s;cruples would
have vani&s;hed before an irre&s;i&s;tible intere&s;t.
As it was, believing that he, like her&s;elf,
had been impo&s;ed upon by the Marche&s;a's
agents, in the di&s;gui&s;e of officials, &s;he con|cluded,
<PB N="344" REF="349">
as has before appeared, that he
how &s;uffered a temporary impri&s;onment
by order of his mother, at one of the
family villas. When, however, Schedoni,
awaking from his reverie, abruptly men|tioned
Vivaldi, her &s;pirits fluttered with
impatience to learn his exact &s;ituation,
and &s;he enquired re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>"I am no &s;tranger to your attach|ment,"
&s;aid Schedoni, evading the que&s;|tion,
"but I wi&s;h to be informed of &s;ome
circum&s;tances relative to it's commence|ment."</P>
<P>Ellena, confu&s;ed, and not knowing
what to reply, was for a moment &s;ilent,
and then repeated her enquiry.</P>
<P>"Where did you fir&s;t meet?" &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till di&s;regarding her que&s;tion.
Ellena related, that &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een
Vivaldi, when attending her aunt from
the church of San Lorenzo. For the
pre&s;ent &s;he was &s;pared the embarra&s;&s;ment
of further explanation by Spalatro, who,
<PB N="345" REF="350">
riding up to Schedoni, informed him they
were approaching the town of Zanti. On
looking forward, Ellena perceived hou&s;es
peeping from among the fore&s;t-trees, at a
&s;hort di&s;tance, and pre&s;ently heard the
cheerful bark of a dog, that &s;ure herald
and faithful &s;ervant of man!</P>
<P>Soon after the travellers entered Zanti,
a &s;mall town &s;urrounded by the fore&s;t,
where, however, the poverty of the inha|bitants
&s;eemed to forbid a longer &s;tay
than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for repo&s;e,
and a flight refre&s;hment. Spalatro led
the way to a cabin, in which the few per|&s;ons,
that journied this road were u&s;ually
entertained. The appearance of the peo|ple,
who owned it, was as wild as their
country, and the interior of the dwelling
was &s;o dirty and comfortle&s;s, that Sche|doni,
preferring to take his repa&s;t in the
open air, a table was &s;pread under the
luxuriant &s;hade of the fore&s;t-trees, at a
little di&s;tance. Here, when the ho&s;t
<PB N="346" REF="351">
had withdrawn, and Spalatro had been
di&s;patched to examine the po&s;t-hor&s;es, and
to procure a lay-habit for the Confe&s;&s;or,
the latter, once more alone with Ellena,
began to experience again &s;omewhat of
the embara&s;&s;ments of con&s;cience; and
Ellena, whenever her eyes glanced upon
him, &s;uffered a &s;olemnity of fear that ro&s;e
almo&s;t to terror. He, at length, termi|nated
this emphatic &s;ilence, by renewing
his mention of Vivaldi, and his command
that Ellena &s;hould relate the hi&s;tory of
their affection. Not daring to refu&s;e, &s;he
obeyed, but with as much brevity as po&s;|&s;ible,
and Schedoni did not interrupt her
by a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation. However eligible
their nuptials now appeared to him, he for|bore
to give any hint of approbation, till
he &s;hould have extricated the object of her
regards from his perilous &s;ituation. But,
with Ellena, this very &s;ilence implied the
opinion it was meant to conceal, and,
encouraged by the hope it imparted, &s;he
<PB N="347" REF="352">
ventured once more to a&s;k, by who&s;e order
Vivaldi had been arre&s;ted; whither he had
been conveyed, and the circum&s;tances of
his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Too politic to intru&s;t her with a know|ledge
of his actual condition, the Confe&s;&s;or
&s;pared her the angui&s;h of learning that he
was a pri&s;oner in the Inqui&s;ition. He af|fected
ignorance of the late tran&s;action at
Celano, but ventured to believe, that both
Vivaldi and her&s;elf had been arre&s;ted by
order of the Marche&s;a, who, he conjec|tured,
had thrown him into temporary
confinement, a mea&s;ure which &s;he, no
doubt, had meant to enforce al&s;o towards
Ellena.</P>
<P>"And you, my father," ob&s;erved Elle|na,
"what brought you to my pri&s;on,&mdash;you
who was not informed with the Mar|che&s;a's
de&s;igns? What accident conducted
you to that remote &s;olitude, ju&s;t at the
moment when you could &s;ave your
child!"</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="353">
"Informed of the Marche&s;a's de&s;igns!"
&s;aid Schedoni, with embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;|plea&s;ure:
"Have you ever imagined that
I could be acce&s;&s;ary&mdash;that I could con&s;ent
to a&s;&s;i&s;t, I mean could con&s;ent to be a con|fidant
of &s;uch atrocious"&mdash;Schedoni,
bewildered, confounded, and half betrayed,
checked him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Yet you have &s;aid, the Marche&s;a meant
only to confine me,!" ob&s;erved Ellena;
"was that de&s;ign &s;o atrocious? Alas, my
father! I know too well that her plan was
more atrocious, and &s;ince you had too
much rea&s;on to know this, why do you
&s;ay that impri&s;onment only was intended
for me? But your &s;olicitude for my tran|quillity
leads you to"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What means," interrupted the &s;u&s;pi|cious
Schedoni, "can I particularly have
of under&s;tanding the Marche&s;a's &s;chemes?
I repeat, that I am not her confidant; how
then is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould know
that they extended further than to impri|&s;onment?"</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="354">
"Did you not &s;ave me from the arm of
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!" &s;aid Ellena tenderly; "did
not you wrench the very dagger from his
gra&s;p!"</P>
<P>"I had forgotten, I had forgotten," &s;aid
the Con&s;e&s;&s;or, yet more embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Yes, good minds are ever thus apt to
forget the benefits they confer," replied
Ellena. "But you &s;hall find, my father,
that a grateful heart is equally tenacious to
remember them; it is the indelible regi|&s;ter
of every act that is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the
memory of the benefactor."</P>
<P>"Mention no more of benefits," &s;aid
Schedoni, impatiently; "let &s;ilence on this
&s;ubject henceforth indicate your wi&s;h to
oblige me."</P>
<P>He ro&s;e, and joined the ho&s;t, who was
at the door of his cabin. Schedoni wi&s;h|ed
to di&s;mi&s;s Spalatro as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
and he enquired for a guide to conduct
him through that part of the fore&s;t, which
remained to be traver&s;ed. In this poor
<PB N="350" REF="355">
town, a per&s;on willing to undertake that
office was ea&s;ily to be found, but the ho&s;t
went in que&s;t of a neighbour whom he had
recommended.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Spalatro returned, without
having &s;ucceeded in his commi&s;&s;ion. Not
any lay-habit could be procured, upon &s;o
&s;hort a notice, that &s;uited Schedoni. He
was obliged, therefore, to continue his
journey to the next town at lea&s;t, in his
own dre&s;s, but the. nece&s;&s;ity was not very
&s;erious to him, &s;ince it was improbable that
he &s;hould be known in this ob&s;cure re|gion.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the ho&s;t appeared with his neighbour,
when Schedoni, having receiv|ed
&s;atisfactory an&s;wers to his que&s;tions,
engaged him for the remainder of the fo|re&s;t-road,
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Spalatro. The
ruffian departed with &s;ullen reluctance and
evident ill-will, circum&s;tances which the
Confe&s;&s;or &s;carcely noticed, while occupied
by the &s;atisfaction of e&s;caping from the
<PB N="351" REF="356">
pre&s;ence of the atrocious partner of his
con&s;cience. But Ellena, as he pa&s;&s;ed her,
ob&s;erved the malignant di&s;appointment of
his look, and it &s;erved only to heighten
the thankfulne&s;s his departure occa&s;ioned
her.</P>
<P>It was afternoon before the travellers
proceeded. Schedoni had calculated that
they could ea&s;ily reach the town, at which
they de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night, before the
clo&s;e of evening, and he had been in no
ha&s;te to depart during the heat of the day.
Their track now lay through a country le&s;s
&s;avage, though &s;carcely le&s;s wild than that
they had pa&s;&s;ed in the morning. It
emerged from the interior towards the
border of the fore&s;t; they were no lon|ger
enclo&s;ed by impending mountains;
the withdrawing &s;hades were no longer
impenetrable to the eye, but now and
then opened to gleams of &s;un&s;hine-land|&s;cape,
and blue di&s;tances; and in the im|mediate
&s;cene, many a green glade &s;pread
<PB N="352" REF="357">
it's bo&s;om to the &s;un. The grandeur of
the trees, however, did not decline; the
plane, the oak, and the che&s;tnut &s;till
threw a pomp of foliage round the&s;e &s;mil|ing
&s;pots, and &s;eemed to con&s;ecrate the
mountain &s;treams, that de&s;cended beneath
their &s;olemn &s;hade.</P>
<P>To the hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of Ellena the
changing &s;cenery was refre&s;hing, and &s;he
frequently yielded her cares to the in|fluence
of maje&s;tic nature. Over the
gloom of Schedoni, no &s;cenery had, at any
moment, power; the &s;hape and paint of
external imagery gave neither impre&s;&s;ion
or colour to his fancy. He contemned the
&s;weet illu&s;ions, to which other &s;pirits are
liable, and which often confer a delight
more exqui&s;ite, and not le&s;s innocent,
than any, which deliberative rea&s;on can
be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thoughtful &s;ilence, that had
wrapt him at the beginning of the jour|ney,
he &s;till pre&s;erved, except when occa|&s;ionally
<PB N="353" REF="358">
he a&s;ked a que&s;tion of the guide con|cerning
the way, and received an&s;wers too
loquacious for his humour. This loqua|city,
however, was not ea&s;ily repre&s;&s;ed, and
the pea&s;ant had already begun to relate
&s;ome terrible &s;tories of murder, committed
in the&s;e fore&s;ts upon people, who had been
hardy enough to venture into them with|out
a guide, before the again ab&s;tracted
Schedoni even noticed that he &s;poke.
Though Ellena did not give much credit
to the&s;e narratives, they had &s;ome effect
upon her fears, when &s;oon after &s;he entered
the deep &s;hades of a part of the fore&s;t, that
lay along a narrow defile, whence every
glimp&s;e of cheerful land&s;cape was again ex|cluded
by precipices, which towered on ei|ther
&s;ide. The &s;tilne&s;s was not le&s;s effectual
than the gloom, for no &s;ounds were heard,
except &s;uch as &s;eemed to characterize &s;oli|tude,
and impre&s;s it's awful power more
deeply on the heart,&mdash;the hollow da&s;h|ing
of torrents de&s;cending di&s;tantly, and the
<PB N="354" REF="359">
deep &s;ighings of the wind, as it pa&s;&s;ed
among trees, which threw their broad arms
over the cliffs, and crowned the highe&s;t
&s;ummits. Onward, through the narrow|ing
windings of the defile, no living object
appeared; but, as Ellena looked fearfully
back, &s;he thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed a hu|man
figure advancing beneath the du&s;ky
umbrage that clo&s;ed the view. She com|municated
her &s;u&s;picion to Schedoni,
though not her fears, and they &s;topped
for a moment, to ob&s;erve further. The
object advanced &s;lowly, and they perceived
the &s;tature of a man, who, having conti|nued
to approach, &s;uddenly pau&s;ed, and
then glided away behind the foliage that
cro&s;&s;ed the per&s;pective, but not before
Ellena fancied &s;he di&s;criminated the figure
of Spalatro, None but a purpo&s;e the
mo&s;t de&s;perate, &s;he believed, could have
urged him to follow into this pa&s;s, in&s;tead
of returning, as he had pretended, to his
home. Yet it appeared improbable, that
<PB N="355" REF="360">
he alone &s;hould be willing to attack two
armed per&s;ons, for both Schedoni and the
guide had weapons of defence. This con|&s;ideration
afforded her only a momentary
re&s;pite from apprehen&s;ion, &s;ince it was po&s;|&s;ible
that he might not be alone, though
only one per&s;on had yet been &s;een among
the &s;hrouding branches of the woods.
"Did you not think he re&s;embled Spala|tro?"
&s;aid Ellena to the Confe&s;&s;or, "was
he not of the &s;ame &s;tature and air? You are
well armed, or I &s;hould fear for you, as
well as for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I did not ob&s;erve a re&s;emblance,"
replied Schedoni, throwing a glance back,
"but whoever he is, you have nothing
to apprehend from him, for he has di&s;|appeared."</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor, &s;o much the wor&s;e,"
ob&s;erved the guide, "&s;o much the
wor&s;e, if he means us any harm, for he
can &s;teal along the rocks behind the&s;e
thickets, and &s;trike out upon us before
<PB N="356" REF="361">
we are aware of him. Or, if he knows
the path that runs among tho&s;e old oaks
yonder, on the left, where the ground
ri&s;es, he has us &s;ure at the turning of
the next cliff."</P>
<P>" Speak lower," &s;aid Schedoni, " un|le&s;s
you mean that he &s;hould benefit by
your in&s;tructions."</P>
<P>Though the Confe&s;&s;or &s;aid this without
any &s;u&s;picion of evil intention from the
guide, the man immediately began to
ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and added, " I'll give him
a hint of what he may expect, however,
if he attacks us." As he &s;poke, he fired
his trombone in the air, when every rock
reverberated the &s;ound, and the faint
and fainter thunder retired in murmurs
through all the windings of the defile.
The eagerne&s;s, with which the guide had
ju&s;tified him&s;elf, produced an effect upon
Schedoni contrary to what he de&s;igned;
and the Confe&s;&s;or, as he watched him
&s;u&s;piciou&s;ly, ob&s;erved, that after he had
<PB N="357" REF="362">
fired, he did not load his piece again.
" Since you have given the enemy &s;uffi|cient
intimation where to find us," &s;aid
Schedoni, " you will do well to prepare
for his reception; load again, friend. I
have arms too, and they are ready."</P>
<P>While the man &s;ullenly obeyed, El|lena,
again alarmed, looked back in &s;earch
of the &s;tranger, but not any per&s;on ap|peared
beneath the gloom, and no foot|&s;tep
broke upon the &s;tilne&s;s. When,
however, &s;he &s;uddenly heard a ru&s;tling
noi&s;e, &s;he looked to the bordering thick|ets,
almo&s;t expecting to &s;ee Spalatro break
from among them, before &s;he perceived
that it was only the &s;ounding pinions of
birds, which, &s;tartled by the report of
the trombone from their high ne&s;ts in
the cliffs, winged their way from danger.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picions of the Confe&s;&s;or had,
probably, been &s;light, for they were tran|&s;ient;
and when Ellena next addre&s;&s;ed
him, he had again retired within him&s;elf.
He was ruminating upon an excu&s;e to be
<PB N="358" REF="363">
offered the Marche&s;a, which might be
&s;ufficient both to a&s;&s;uage her di&s;appoint|ment
and baffle her curio&s;ity, and he
could not, at pre&s;ent, fabricate one that
might &s;oothe her re&s;entment, without
ri&s;k of betraying his &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Twilight had added its gloom to that
of the rocks, before the travellers di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the town, at which they meant to
pa&s;s the night. It terminated the defile,
and its grey hou&s;es could &s;carcely be di&s;|cerned
from the precipice upon which
they hung, or from the trees that em|bo&s;omed
them. A rapid &s;tream rolled
below, and over it a bridge conducted
the wanderers to the little inn, at which
they were to take up their abode. Here,
quietly lodged, Ellena di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all pre&s;ent
apprehen&s;ion of Spalatro, but &s;he &s;till
believed &s;he had &s;een him, and her &s;u&s;pi|cions,
as to the motive of his extraordinary
journey, were not appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>As this was a town of ampler accom|modation
than the one they had left, Sche|doni
<PB N="359" REF="364">
ea&s;ily procured a lay-habit, that
would di&s;gui&s;e him for the remainder of
the journey; and Ellena was permitted to
lay a&s;ide the nun's veil, for one of a more
general fa&s;hion; but, in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing it, &s;he
did not forget that it had been the veil of
Olivia, and &s;he pre&s;erved it as a &s;acred
relique of her favourite reclu&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance between this town and
Naples was &s;till that of &s;everal days jour|ney,
according to the u&s;ual mode of tra|velling;
but the mo&s;t dangerous part of
the way was now overcome, the road
having emerged from the fore&s;ts; and
when Schedoni, on the following morn|ing,
was departing, he would have di&s;|charged
the guide, had not the ho&s;t
a&s;&s;ured him, he would find one &s;till nece&s;|&s;ary
in the open, but wild, country through
which he mu&s;t pa&s;s. Schedoni's di&s;tru&s;t
of this guide had never been very &s;erious,
and, as the re&s;ult of the preceding even|ing
proved favourable, he had re&s;tored
him &s;o entirely to his confidence, as will|ingly
<PB N="360" REF="365">
to engage him for the pre&s;ent day.
In this confidence, however, Ellena did not
perfectly coincide; &s;he had ob&s;erved the
man while he loaded the trombone, on
Schedoni's order, and his evident reluc|tance
had almo&s;t per&s;uaded her, that he
was in league with &s;ome per&s;on who de|&s;igned
to attack them; a conjecture, per|haps,
the more readily admitted while her
mind was &s;uffering from the impre&s;&s;ion of
having &s;een Spalatro. She now ventured
to hint her di&s;tru&s;t to the Confe&s;&s;or, who
paid little attention to it, and reminded
her, that &s;ufficient proof of the man's
hone&s;ty had appeared, in their having been
permitted to pa&s;s in &s;afety, a defile &s;o con|venient
for the purpo&s;e of rapine as that
of ye&s;terday. To a reply apparently &s;o
rea&s;onable, Ellena could oppo&s;e nothing,
had &s;he even dared to pre&s;s the topic;
and &s;he re-commenced the journey with
gayer hopes.</P>
