<HEAD>Mr. Maitland's
ACCOUNT
Of INOCULATING the
SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING under&s;tood, &s;ince my
Retirement into the Country,
that the late Experiment of
Inoculating the Small-Pox at
<HI>Newgate,</HI> has been pretty much
talk'd of; and finding withal, that the
Reports of that Matter are various, and
oftentimes contradictory: I thought it be|came
me, to give the Publick a plain and
hone&s;t Account of the Truth of Facts;
both to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, any one's being
impos'd upon, as to the Trials already
made; or &s;ear'd from the Practice of <HI>it</HI> for
the future.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
'Tis not here my De&s;ign to offer an
E&s;&s;ay on the Theory of the Small-Pox; or
to attempt the be&s;t Methods of Cure: I
leave that to the learned Gentlemen of the
Profe&s;&s;ion; who, I do not que&s;tion, not|with&s;tanding
all their be&s;t Di&s;coveries and
Ob&s;ervations hitherto made, will certainly
agree with me, That <HI>it</HI> is a Di&s;temper of
the mo&s;t fatal and de&s;tructive kind; and
that, far from being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of any infal|lible
Method or Remedy, they will own,
'tis many Times too too hard for them, and
very often baffles the mo&s;t celebrated Skill.</P>
<P>They cannot then be offended, (I am
&s;ure the better and more candid Part of
the Faculty will not) if, out of a &s;ingle
View of doing good, I here publi&s;h to the
World a certain Method of Relieving Man|kind,
and re&s;cuing them from the Fears
and fatal Effects of that very loath&s;ome
and malignant Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Method I here propo&s;e, is no other
than that very plain one of rai&s;ing the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation.</HI> A Method,
new indeed, and utterly unknown here,
till of late, tho' univer&s;ally practis'd with
Succe&s;s all over <HI>Turky</HI> the&s;e three&s;core
Years pa&s;t; and in other Parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI>
an hundred, or, for ought we know, &s;ome
hundreds of Years before. The Practice
having thus obtain'd among&s;t an illiterate
Sort of People, what I here offer to recom|mend
<HI>it,</HI> &s;hall be delivered in the plaine&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Manner, and &s;uited to the meane&s;t Capa|city,
without the labour'd Embelli&s;hments
of Learning or Eloquence: And indeed,
one would think, the&s;e &s;hould not be here
wanted, to reconcile to this very &s;afe and
u&s;eful Method, even Per&s;ons or a higher
Rank, and more delicate Ta&s;te; e&s;pecially
&s;ince they, of all Sorts of People, generally
&s;peaking, &s;uffer the mo&s;t; witne&s;s the Ha|vock
made in great Families, not many
Months &s;ince, by that Mighty Di&s;ea&s;e,
which &s;eem'd then to go forth like a de|&s;troying
Angel, &s;ubduing all before it, and
contemning all human Means us'd to &s;top
<HI>its</HI> Career.</P>
<P>It may therefore be hoped, that This
Practice &s;hould meet with a kind Reception
even by them, who, of all others, are mo&s;t
terribly fearful of the prodigious Loath|&s;omene&s;s
of the Di&s;temper, and of the ugly
and mon&s;trous Effects <HI>it</HI> leaves, both on
them, and their Children: Yet being ap|prehen&s;ive,
that Sloth and Lazine&s;s, ill|placed
Affection and Tenderne&s;s, and it
may be, &s;ome wor&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions too, which
I am not willing to &s;ugge&s;t, may po&s;&s;ibly
&s;tifle this &s;afe and u&s;eful Method in its
Birth; I &s;hall here take a little Pains to
obviate the Scruples and Objections, which
are commonly rais'd again&s;t <HI>it.</HI> And in
Order to this, &s;hall, fir&s;t of all, give a
Short and Hi&s;torical Account of what I
<PB N="4" REF="7">
have &s;een and practis'd, both in <HI>Turky</HI> and
at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1717, when I had the Ho|nour
to attend the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador and
his Family at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I had a fair
Opportunity fully to inform my &s;elf of
what I had long before heard, namely, the
famous Practice of <HI>Tran&s;planting,</HI> or rai&s;ing
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>My Enquiry chiefly turn'd upon two or
three Particulars, which, I thought, could
I be well &s;atisfied in, would go a great way
towards convincing me of the mighty Ad|vantages
and Safety of the Method, and
re&s;olving my greate&s;t Scruples and Difficul|ties
again&s;t <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>Having heard that this contagious Di&s;|ea&s;e,
which for many Centuries of Years
has prov'd &s;uch a terrible Scourge to Man|kind,
had its fir&s;t Ri&s;e in <HI>Egypt, Arabia,</HI>
and other Parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> I thought it
proper to enquire, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whether it conti|nues
&s;till to rage in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions
in that violent Manner it was anciently
ob&s;erv'd to do; and as at times, <HI>it</HI> is known
to attack us here, and mo&s;t other Parts
of <HI>Europe:</HI> For &s;hould <HI>it</HI> be found to be
always of a milder and more temperate
Sort than ours, why &s;hould that People
take &s;o very &s;trange and uncommon a Way
to avoid <HI>it?</HI> I quickly found the Ca&s;e to
be quite otherwi&s;e, being a&s;&s;ur'd, be&s;ides
<PB N="5" REF="8">
what I &s;aw with my Eyes; that the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> is rather more Malignant and Epidemic
there, than with us; in&s;omuch that, as
&s;ome have affirmed, one half, or at lea&s;t
one third Part of the Di&s;ea&s;ed, at certain
Times, do die of <HI>it</HI>; and they that e&s;cape,
are terribly disfigur'd by it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid., D. Timoni &amp; Pylarini Epi&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Again, I enquired what were the Sym|ptoms
which attend, this new and &s;trange
Operation? And whether the I&s;&s;ue is al|ways
known to be &s;alutary? The Di&s;|order
both before and after the Eruption
was &s;o very &s;light and gentle, that, in
Strictne&s;s of Speech, it could not be called
a Di&s;ea&s;e, having none of the u&s;ual Com|plaints
of Pain in the Back, Vomitings,
Head-achs, Thir&s;t, Inquietude, and the
like, the Pul&s;e being only &s;omewhat fuller
and higher than before; yet &s;o far from a
Fever, that it &s;carce de&s;erves the Name of
a <HI>Febricula,</HI> bating &s;ome &s;ingular In&s;tances,
which are &s;o rare, that they are not One
to a Thou&s;and. And la&s;t of all, which I
thought not a little material, The Pu&s;tules,
whether many or few, (and they common|ly
were from 10 to an 100, &s;ometimes more)
never left any Marks or Pits behind them,
except only in the Inci&s;ions, or Parts In|grafted.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
But &s;till I had one Difficulty left, which
I took to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable; and
which, if not fully clear'd, would render,
in my Opinion, the whole of the Proce&s;s
but trifling and precarious: And that is,
whether every one who has undergone this
Operation, is really &s;ecured again&s;t all fu|ture
Danger of catching the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by
Infection? Were I but well a&s;&s;ur'd of this,
I &s;hould then, I thought, be at Liberty to
practi&s;e <HI>it</HI> my &s;elf, and likewi&s;e with Con|fidence
recommend <HI>it</HI> to others. All my
Enquiries here were fully an&s;wered beyond
Expre&s;&s;ion: For I was a&s;&s;ured by all, and
they could have no De&s;ign to impo&s;e upon
me, that there was not an In&s;tance known
of any one's being ever infected, who had
had any Pu&s;tules at all, how few &s;o ever
rais'd by <HI>Inoculation</HI>; tho' for a further
Trial, &s;everal had been once and again
Ingrafted; and others al&s;o had been con|fined
to the Room, and in the &s;ame Bed
too with the Infected. This I rejoiced to
hear, and from thence concluded the Pra|ctice
to be univer&s;ally &s;afe and u&s;eful. And
indeed wonder'd not a little, that, not|with&s;tanding
the Authentic Accounts there|of
more than once tran&s;mitted into <HI>England,</HI>
there had never been hitherto any fair
and full Trial made of it.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o I could not forbear admiring
the very great Sagacity of the Men who
fir&s;t invented this Method; and the lau|dable
<PB N="7" REF="10">
and diligent Ob&s;ervation of them
too, who &s;o carefully practis'd it them&s;elves,
and &s;o faithfully convey'd it to their Neigh|bours:
They all indeed were &s;en&s;ible of
the Benefit, and found their Account in it.</P>
<P>About this Time, the Amba&s;&s;ador's in|genious
Lady, who had been at &s;ome Pains
to &s;atisfie her Curio&s;ity in this Matter, and
had made &s;ome u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations on the
Practice, was &s;o thoroughly convinced of
the Safety of it, that <HI>She</HI> re&s;olv'd to &s;ub|mit
<HI>her</HI> only Son to it, a very hopeful Boy
of about Six Years of Age: She fir&s;t of all
order'd me to find out a fit Subject to take
the Matter from; and then &s;ent for an old
<HI>Greek</HI> Woman, who had practis'd this Way
a great many Years: After a good deal
of Trouble and Pains, I found a proper
Subject, and then the good Woman went
to work; but &s;o awkwardly by the &s;hak|ing
of her Hand, and put the Child to &s;o
much Torture with her blunt and ru&s;ty
Needle, that I pitied his Cries, who had
ever been of &s;uch Spirit and Courage, that
hardly any Thing of Pain could make him
cry before; and therefore Inoculated the
other Arm with my own In&s;trument, and
with &s;o little Pain to him, that he did not
in the lea&s;t complain of it. The Opera|tion
took in both Arms, and &s;ucceeded
perfectly well. After the third Day, bright
red Spots appear'd in his Face, then di&s;|appear'd;
and thus interchangeably (as it
<PB N="8" REF="11">
commonly happens) till in the Night be|twixt
the Seventh and Eighth Day, he
was ob&s;erved to be a little hot and thir&s;ty,
yet remain'd &s;o but a few Hours; and then
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> came out fair: They be|came
round and yellow, like tho&s;e of the
more gentle di&s;tinct kind; and the Red
Spots which appeared fir&s;t, were the fulle&s;t
and large&s;t of all: They began to cru&s;t
a few Days after, and then gently died
away; &s;o that the young Gentleman was
quickly in a Condition to go Abroad with
Safety. He had above an hundred in all
upon his Body; but without any the lea&s;t
Di&s;order but what I have mentioned:
And they all fell off, without leaving any
one Mark or Impre&s;&s;ion behind them. This
Operation was performed at <HI>Pera</HI> near <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI>
in the Month of <HI>March</HI> 1717.</P>
<P>The Honourable Lady abovementioned,
who had been happily delivered of a Daugh|ter
&s;ome three Months before, &s;eeing the
great Succe&s;s of the Operation upon her
Son, had a Mind to have it tried al&s;o
upon the Infant: But this, for certain Rea|&s;ons,
was then laid a&s;ide, and I hope very
luckily, being re&s;erv'd to &s;et the Fir&s;t and
Great Example to <HI>England,</HI> of the perfect
Safety of this Practice, and e&s;pecially to
Per&s;ons of the Fir&s;t Rank and Quality,
who have ever &s;uffer'd &s;o much by that
fatal Di&s;temper.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">
This Noble Lady &s;ent for me la&s;t <HI>April,</HI>
and when I came, &s;he told me, &s;he was
now re&s;olved to have her Daughter Ino|culated,
and de&s;ir'd me forthwith to find
out Matter for the Purpo&s;e. I pleaded
for a Delay of a Week or two, the Wea|ther
being then cold and wet; for indeed,
I was unwilling to venture on an Experi|ment
altogether new and uncommon here,
in a cold Sea&s;on; tho' I am now convinc'd
it may, with due Care, be practis'd at all
Times and Sea&s;ons, but &s;till with more
Safety in the temperate and favourable.
I al&s;o pray'd, that any two Phy&s;icians,
whom they thought fit, might be call'd,
not only to con&s;ult the Health and Safety
of the Child, but likewi&s;e to be Eye|witne&s;&s;es
of the Practice, and contribute to
the Credit and Reputation of it. This
indeed was at fir&s;t deny'd me, it may be,
out of a De&s;ign to keep it &s;ecret, or lea&s;t
it &s;hould come to nothing.</P>
<P>In the mean time having found proper
Matter, I ingrafted it in both Arms, after
the u&s;ual Manner; the Child was neither
blooded nor purg'd before, nor indeed was
it nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;idering the clean Habit
of Body, and the very cool, regular Diet
&s;he had ever been kept to from her In|fancy.
She continued ea&s;ie and well,
without any &s;en&s;ible Alteration, bateing
the u&s;ual little Spots and Flu&s;hings, till
the tenth Night, when &s;he was ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="10" REF="13">
to be a little hot and Feveri&s;h. An an|cient
Apothecary in the Neighbourhood
being then call'd, prudently advis'd not
to give the Child any Medicine, a&s;&s;uring
them there was no Danger, and that the
Heat would quickly abate, which accord|ingly
it did; and the Small Pox began
next Morning to appear, which was indeed
&s;ome two Days later than u&s;ual, by rea|&s;on
of the uncommon Di&s;charge of Matter
at the Inci&s;ions from the Beginning. Three
learned Phy&s;icians of the College were ad|mitted,
one after another, to vi&s;it the
young Lady; they are all Gentlemen of
Honour, and will on all Occa&s;ions declare,
as they have hitherto done, that they &s;aw
<HI>Mi&s;s Wortley</HI> playing about the Room,
chearful and well, with the Small Pox
rais'd upon her; and that in a few Days
after &s;he perfectly recover'd of them. Se|veral
Ladies, and other Per&s;ons of Di&s;tin|ction,
vi&s;ited al&s;o this young Patient, and
can atte&s;t the Truth of this Fact. I need
not here be more particular in determining
the &s;everal Periods of this Cafe, they being
the very &s;ame with that abovementioned;
except only that here the Pu&s;tules were
not &s;o many, nor did they ripen &s;o &s;oon;
which may be ea&s;ily accounted for, with|out
having Regard to the Difference of
Climates, for there is little or nothing in
that, &s;eeing the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> and others
inhabiting the Banks of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
a Climate much colder and more difficult
than ours, practi&s;e <HI>it</HI> with Safety.</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance I &s;hall give for the
further Confirmation of this Practice; name|ly,
one of the learned Phy&s;icians above|mentioned,
who had vi&s;ited <HI>Mi&s;s Wortley,</HI>
having &s;ome Years &s;ince fully inform'd him|&s;elf
of this Method of Practice, and being
thoroughly &s;atisfied of the Safety and
Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, at length re&s;olved
to try it in his own Family: He had for|merly
lo&s;t &s;ome Children in a very malig|nant
kind of the Small Pox, and therefore
de&s;ired me to lo&s;e no Time to ingraft the
only Son he had left. The Boy (who was
not quite Six Years of Age) being of a
pretty warm and &s;anguine Complexion, the
Doctor ordered about five Ounces of Blood
to be taken from him; and then, in ten
Days after, having found Matter which he
lik'd, I inoculated him in both Arms. This
was performed the 11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI>; next
Day having look'd at the Inci&s;ions, I found
them both inflam'd, which convinced me
the Thing had taken. Some Red Spots
appeared about his Temples the third
Day; and &s;ome two or three Pu&s;tules be|tween
the &s;eventh and eighth; the Boy
being all the while without any Thing of
Thir&s;t, Head-ach, or any other Di&s;order,
only his Pul&s;e was ob&s;erv'd to be fuller
and quicker; and then about the 10<HI>th</HI> or
11<HI>th,</HI> &s;ome more Pu&s;tules appear'd round
<PB N="12" REF="15">
and yellow; and in two or three Days
more dy'd away: The Inci&s;ions continuing
all the while inflamed, and di&s;charging a
thick well-dige&s;ted Matter.</P>
<P>Here I could bring a great many Ca&s;es
of Per&s;ons inoculated in <HI>Turky,</HI> to prove
the con&s;tant and certain Succe&s;s of this
Practice; in all which I have never &s;een
any Mi&s;carriage, except in One, which was
wholly owing to the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Inadver|tence
of a Surgeon at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> I
would not here be thought to pretend to
a Secret, or to make a My&s;tery of this
Operation; no, my De&s;ign is, only to advi&s;e
every one that attempts it to be cautious:
For ill Con&s;equences may &s;ometimes hap|pen,
and never more than in Things com|mon
and ea&s;y, and adapted to vulgar Ca|pacities.
In it &s;elf indeed it is &s;imple and
obvious, and may, like other plain Chi|rurgical
Operations, be in a manner Me|chanically
learn'd and practis'd: For, not
to mention &s;everal Surgeons, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s
it is; I knew an old <HI>Greek</HI> Woman, who,
having been taught it from her Youth, had
practi&s;ed it with Succe&s;s a great many Years.</P>
<P>Hence, if any Regard be due to Facts,
and to the mo&s;t certain Ob&s;ervation and
Experience of others; which, in Matters
of Practice, have ever been counted the
be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Direction; I am per&s;waded,
all impartial People will allow this Method
to be not only &s;afe, but u&s;eful; and highly
<PB N="13" REF="16">
worthy to be receiv'd with E&s;teem and
Applau&s;e. Is it not a Matter of the greate&s;t
Importance to us, to know how to prevent
the mighty Contagion of the Small Pox;
and how to pre&s;erve our Children and Fa|milies
from the violent Attacks, and fatal
Effects of it? What would not tender
Parents give to &s;ecure to them the Lives
and Features of their beloved Offspring;
when they behold them disfigured by the
loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;truggling with the
Pangs of Death? Do not we oftentimes
&s;ee great Families extingui&s;h'd by it, as by
the Plague, and their Titles and E&s;tates
thereby tran&s;mitted to Strangers? And if
they have the good Fortune to e&s;cape with
their Lives, what an ugly Change from
what they were before? What Pittings,
Seams, and Scars in their Faces? What
Films and Fi&s;tula's, and &s;ometimes Blind|ne&s;s
in their Eyes? What Ulcers and Im|po&s;thumes
in their Bodies; Contractions of
the Nerves, and even Lamene&s;s for Life?
Again, to avoid the Infection, what Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
and Di&s;quiet of Mind, what Fears
and Apprehen&s;ions do not even grown Peo|ple
labour under, e&s;pecially the more de|licate
and tender? Don't they renounce
all Commerce with their be&s;t Friends and
deare&s;t Relations? And if by chance they
meet an Object that has but lately reco|ver'd,
how &s;u&s;ceptible then are they of
<PB N="14" REF="17">
the Di&s;temper? And how few thus &s;eiz'd
do ever e&s;cape?</P>
<P>In &s;hort then, to prevent all the&s;e, and
many the like Calamities, the almo&s;t univer|&s;al
and inevitable Con&s;equences of this
fatal Di&s;ea&s;e; I may truly venture to af|firm,
that the Method here recommended
is, of all others hitherto known, the &s;afe&s;t;
and I am &s;ure far more infallible, than
that of the mo&s;t learned and mo&s;t cautious
Practice.</P>
<P>I have, however, in Conver&s;ation, met
with &s;everal Scruples and Objections again&s;t
this Method; &s;ome whereof relate to the
manner of the Operation; which, I hope,
by the Account already given, are in &s;ome
mea&s;ure &s;atisfy'd: Some again concern the
Lawfulne&s;s of it; and others would even
&s;eem to que&s;tion the Fact, denying that
the Small Pox are hereby rais'd; or that
the Eruptions ought to be deem'd of that
kind; &s;ince they are not preceded by a
Fever, nor attended with the u&s;ual Pe|riods
of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>They that &s;cruple the Lawfulne&s;s of this
Practice, are apt to call it, a Pre&s;umption,
a forcing of Nature, a tempting of Provi|dence,
and the like. True indeed, were
the Operation in it &s;elf dangerous; and
the I&s;&s;ue generally doubtful, as &s;everal,
both in Phy&s;ick and Surgery &s;ometimes are,
yet neither pre&s;umptuous nor unlawful for
all that; I &s;hould be ready to own the
<PB N="15" REF="18">
Charge, and yield it at once to the tender|hearted
and the &s;crupulous: But pray,
what are they afraid of? Is there any
Thing here frightful, or &s;hocking to the
nice&s;t and the mo&s;t delicate? The Practice
is mo&s;t plain, rational, and ea&s;ie, intended
only to prevent the malignant Infection,
and to pre&s;erve Life: not to give a Di&s;ea&s;e,
and in this Sen&s;e, to force Nature before
its Time; but in effect, to clean&s;e Nature
from the latent <HI>Fomes</HI> or <HI>Seminium</HI>; and
to &s;ecure again&s;t that popular Contagion.
We have heard, and indeed it were much
to be wi&s;h'd we had any that truly de&s;erve
the Name, of Pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the
Plague; And why may not <HI>This,</HI> which has
el&s;ewhere been &s;o univer&s;ally tried and ap|proved,
pa&s;s for One again&s;t the Small Pox?</P>
<P>But again, what do they mean by tempt|ing
of Providence? Can they imagine,
that u&s;ing the fair and proper Means of
avoiding and preventing a Di&s;ea&s;e, is often|&s;ive
to Providence? Why then do they
Bleed, Vomit, or Purge, or u&s;e any other
Remedy, to prevent a Fever? And why
don't they tru&s;t that Providence, rather than
dare to abandon their Families, and de&s;ert
the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, to flee from <HI>this</HI> or any
other Di&s;ea&s;e? Nay, &s;o far am I from
counting this Method tempting to Provi|dence,
that I rather e&s;teem it a Motive of
Thankfulne&s;s to the divine Providence, and
a great one too, for, the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">
As to the Objection again&s;t the <HI>Fact,</HI> de|nying
the Small Pox to be hereby rais'd:
Did the Eruptions come the natural and
common way, I acknowledge it to be highly
rea&s;onable: For the only way we have to
di&s;tingui&s;h between the genuine Small Pox
of the &s;everal kinds, and the &s;purious, or
what they call the <HI>Chicken Pox,</HI> is not only
by ob&s;erving the Nature and Periods of the
Pu&s;tules, but al&s;o by the fir&s;t Inva&s;ion, and
&s;ub&s;equent Progre&s;s of the Fever, and of
the u&s;ual Symptoms attending it. The
known Periods of the Small Pox are diffe|rent,
according to their different kinds;
and this Difference ari&s;eth, not only from
the various Di&s;po&s;itions of the Juices and
Habits of the Bodies affected; but likewi&s;e
from the different Degrees and Qualities
of the External Infection, how&s;oever com|municated,
as it is more or le&s;s &s;ubtil,
malignant and epidemic.</P>
<P>Now in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> rais'd by Inoculation, the
Periods, tho' a little different from the com|mon
and natural, are, in their kind, as
certain and regular as the other: A Dif|ference
indeed is ob&s;erv'd of &s;ometimes two
or three Days, as to the Time of Eruption;
but that is no more than what is common
in the natural Sort. And thus too, it is
with Re&s;pect to the other Stages of the
Di&s;ea&s;e: I mean tho&s;e of the Inva&s;ion,
Maturation, and Declination; they are
equal and regular, and what is more, the
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Proce&s;s is certain, and the Progno&s;tick in|fallible.</P>
<P>But the principal and mo&s;t material Dif|ference
of all lies in the <HI>Fever,</HI> which here
is &s;o gentle, that it hardly de&s;erves the
Name; but in the natural, and e&s;pecially
the confluent kind, 'tis always violent, and
often the immediate Cau&s;e of Death.</P>
<P>Were it not altogether foreign to my
De&s;ign, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Brevity
I here propo&s;e, I could ea&s;ily demon&s;trate
the Cau&s;e of this Difference; and make
it appear, that the &s;mall Quantity of the
Matter in&s;erted into the Capillary Ve&s;&s;els
of the Skin, is not capable of altering or
di&s;&s;olving the Ma&s;s of Blood, as it happens
in the Ca&s;e of Infection; nor of rai&s;ing an
Ebullition &s;ufficient to produce a Fever, and
the dangerous Symptoms which always fol|low
upon it: And yet it is certain, not|with&s;tanding
all this, that the Matter thus
in&s;erted does produce Eruptions of the right
Small Pox kind, with good dige&s;ted Matter,
as hereafter de&s;crib'd; and without any
Thing of the Danger and Loath&s;omene&s;s,
ever in&s;eparable from the other.</P>
<P>That it is the right and genuine kind,
may be further prov'd beyond all Exception,
by a few plain In&s;tances here &s;ubjoin'd;
by which it will appear, that the Small
Pox thus rais'd by Inoculation, is truly in|fectious
and catching; and that &s;everal
Adult Per&s;ons, who never before had them,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
have been actually &s;eiz'd, by means of ki&s;&s;ing
and care&s;&s;ing a Child, not quite three Years
of Age, while the Eruptions thus rais'd
were upon it. What &s;tronger Proof can
rea&s;onably be de&s;ired of the genuine Small
Pox? And what need is there of more
Words or Arguments to convince any one,
that will not be per&s;waded by Facts?</P>
<P>I am ha&s;tening to give you an Account
of tho&s;e Facts, and do a&s;&s;ure you, it &s;hall
be an hone&s;t and a true one. But before
I come to it, I wou'd briefly take notice
of a Que&s;tion or two, which a learned Phy|&s;ician,
one Day ask'd me, on the Subject.
As fir&s;t, Whether I was always &s;ure, thus
to give the Small Pox? And then, whe|ther,
when given, I cou'd engage the Pa|tient
&s;hould never take them again by In|fection?</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, I an&s;wer'd, the Operation had
never yet fail'd me, or any one el&s;e, that
I know of; nor do I believe, it ever can,
when duly perform'd, but upon Per&s;ons who
have had them before: For I very much
que&s;tion, what &s;ome have affirm'd, namely,
That there are People in the World, who
are not &s;u&s;ceptible of the Di&s;ea&s;e. In the
mean time, I had a Mind, with great Sub|mi&s;&s;ion,
to have ask'd the Doctor a plain
Que&s;tion in An&s;wer to his; and that is,
Whether, when he pre&s;cribes a Purge or a
Vomit, he is always &s;ure, it will an&s;wer
his Intention? For I have often heard,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
that Vomits have &s;ometimes prov'd Purges;
and Purges, Vomits too; and, which is
wor&s;e, that People have had the Misfortune
to die under both Operations; which has
never yet happen'd, in the Ca&s;e of Ingraft|ing.</P>
<P>As to the Doctor's &s;econd Que&s;tion, I have
&s;aid &s;omewhat already; and now can add
further, that be&s;ides the frequent Experi|ments
which have been made in <HI>Turky</HI>; as,
of Inoculating the fame Per&s;on a &s;econd
and a third Time, and the like; I my &s;elf
have lately made open and repeated Tryals,
on one of the Six Inoculated Criminals of
<HI>Newgate,</HI> re&s;erved for that purpo&s;e, &s;uffici|ent
to convince any one, that there's no
Danger of their Catching the Di&s;ea&s;e by any
future Infection. This is, One <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Journal annex'd.</NOTE> <HI>Elizabeth
Harri&s;on,</HI> of about nineteen Years of Age.
Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that this Girl,
had the fewe&s;t Eruptions upon her, of any
of the five, that were Inoculated at <HI>Newgate,</HI>
but had a more than Ordinary Di&s;charge
at the Inci&s;ions.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t employ'd her as Nur&s;e to a Servant
Maid, very ill and full of the continued-di&s;tinct
Kind of the Small Pox, in the Hou&s;e
of Mrs. <HI>Mo&s;s,</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital</HI> Buildings
at <HI>Hertford,</HI> whom &s;he attended during the
whole Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. This Maid
<PB N="20" REF="23">
had hardly recover'd, when one of the Boys,
about ten Years Old, of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital,
was al&s;o &s;eiz'd with the very &s;ame Sort; I
oblig'd her to lie every Night in the &s;ame Bed
with this Boy, and to attend him con&s;tantly
from the fir&s;t Beginning of the Di&s;temper to
the very End: And thus &s;he continued for
Six Weeks together, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, or
feeling any the lea&s;t Head-Ach or other Di&s;|order;
tho', indeed, I once &s;aw &s;ome Heats
and little Pimples upon her, as Nur&s;es
commonly have under &s;uch Confinements.
There's no Ground to que&s;tion this Fact,
being atte&s;ted by a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>For a further Confirmation of what I
have &s;aid, I once intended to have here &s;ub|joyn'd
D. <HI>Timoni</HI> and <HI>Pylarini's</HI> Letters,
publi&s;h'd in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,
No. 339 and 347. But being unwilling to
enlarge this Account beyond its ju&s;t Bounds,
I mu&s;t leave them to another Opportunity,

<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 9. 1721. Being <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> betwixt
the Hours of 9 and 10 in the Morning, I
made Inci&s;ions in both Arms and the right
Leg of all the Six.</P>
<P>10 <HI>and</HI> 11. <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> I find
little or no Alteration in any of them,
except <HI>Mary North,</HI> who &s;ometimes was
troubled with Vapours, as u&s;ual to her:
They all &s;leep well, dre&s;s, and walk about
all day, and are hungry for their Food:
Their Pul&s;e a little rais'd, but without any
&s;en&s;ible Di&s;order.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Saturday,</HI> In the Morning; ob&s;erving
the Inci&s;ions not &s;o much inflamed, and
tending to Suppuration as u&s;ual; and thence
&s;u&s;pecting the Matter ingrafted to have
been defective and languid, having been
kept at lea&s;t 15 or 16 Hours, for a very
good, but unavoidable Rea&s;on; I &s;earch'd
for fre&s;h Matter, and having found it in.
<HI>Chri&s;ts Ho&s;pital,</HI> about 6 a Clock at Night
I made new Inci&s;ions in each Arm of five
<PB N="22" REF="25">
of them, and ingrafted it as before. I had
no Matter left for the &s;ixth, <HI>Evans.</HI></P>
<P>13. <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, the&s;e five complain
all of Pain in both Arms: Having taken
off the Dre&s;&s;ings, I find all the fir&s;t Inci&s;ions
inflamed and fe&s;ter'd, but without any
Sickne&s;s in the Patients; their Pul&s;e &s;en|&s;ibly
higher, and their Water turbid.</P>
<P>14. <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, red Spots and
Flu&s;hings appear on all the five; but mo&s;t
of all on <HI>Mary North,</HI> e&s;pecially about her
Face, Neck, and Brea&s;t: And &s;o likewi&s;e
on <HI>Ann Tompion:</HI> But without any Sick|ne&s;s,
Head-ach, or Thir&s;t; except a little
they complained of in the Night; and a
higher Pul&s;e.</P>
<P>15. <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> The &s;ame Spots and Flu&s;h|ings
appear fre&s;h in the Morning; but turn
paler and darker towards Night, yet with|out
any Di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is here to be ob&s;erved, That the &s;ixth,
<HI>viz. Richard Evans,</HI> who had had the
Small Pox in Pri&s;on la&s;t <HI>September,</HI> has had
no manner of Pain, Heat, or Inflammation
in any of his Inci&s;ions, nor any manner of
Alteration otherwi&s;e: But all continuing
pale from the Beginning, ye&s;terday dry'd
up entirely.</P>
<P>16. <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> They all continue much
as before, only their Inci&s;ions begin to di&s;|charge
a thick, purulent Matter. <HI>Anne
Tompion</HI> has a large yellow Pu&s;tule on the
bending of her Thigh, and another on the
<PB N="23" REF="26">
out&s;ide of her right, Arm, like Small Pox:
And <HI>John Alcock</HI> has more fre&s;h Pu&s;tules
appearing on his Face and Arms; having
had a &s;light <HI>Febricula</HI> in the Night, with
di&s;turb'd Water. And <HI>John Cawthery</HI> has
a large yellow Pu&s;tule on his left Cheek,
and &s;everal &s;mall ones on his Face.</P>
<P>17. <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> The &s;aid <HI>Alcock</HI> has the&s;e
Pu&s;tules appearing now fairly, with a yellow
dige&s;ted Matter, and red Bottoms, and a
great many of them, but without Sickne&s;s.
<HI>Ann Tompion</HI> has the &s;ame yellow Pu&s;tules
on her right Arm and Thigh, with other
fre&s;h ones &s;truck out about her Chin and
Mouth.</P>
<P>18. <HI>Friday, Alcock's</HI> Small Pox appear
&s;till fair and yellow, but fuller and larger,
with a bright red round them. All the
others much the &s;ame, with their Inci&s;ions
running.</P>
<P>19. <HI>Saturday,</HI> La&s;t Night, this <HI>Alcock</HI> un|accountably
pricks and opens all the Pu&s;tules
he could come at with a Pin; which occa|&s;ions
them to fall and cru&s;t &s;ooner: But
they continue red at Bottom; and the Inci|&s;ions
in him abate of their Running.</P>
<P>It is here to be noted, that tho' he has had
by much the greate&s;t Number of Pu&s;tules
or Small Pox upon him, yet the &s;econd
Time he was touch'd in one Arm only,
there not being Matter enough for the
other Arm; whereas the other four had
both Arms ingrafted, and Matter in Abun|dance.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">
20 <HI>and</HI> 21. <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Monday,</HI> All of
them continue as before: The Inci&s;ions
on the other four, run &s;till a thick, dige&s;ted,
yellow <HI>Pus.</HI></P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the &s;econd In|ci&s;ions
in both Arms, by which a va&s;t Di&s;|charge
has been made, &s;eem to me, in the
I&s;&s;ue, to have been rather a Prejudice and
Impediment to the <HI>Eruption,</HI> than to have,
in any Sort, contributed towards it: But
however, I believe them to be, in all Re|&s;pects,
as &s;afe from any future Infection as
<HI>Alcock,</HI> who had 60 Small Pox, at lea&s;t up|on
him.</P>
<P>22 <HI>and</HI> 23. <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> All
of them continue well; and their Inci&s;ions
cea&s;e running, and dry up apace.</P>
<P>24. <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> I purg'd <HI>Alcock</HI> and <HI>Caw|thery</HI>
for the fir&s;t Time; and did de&s;ign al&s;o
to purge the three Women; but was pre|vented
by their. <HI>Monthly Purgations,</HI> which,
I was not a little &s;urpriz'd to hear, &s;eiz'd
them all about the &s;ame Time; tho' &s;ome
of them had been ob&s;tructed &s;everal Months
before.</P>
<P>28. <HI>Monday, Mary North,</HI> before &s;he was
quite free, unaccountably wa&s;h'd in cold
Water, and thence caught a violent Colic,
which la&s;ted near two Days.</P>
<P>30. <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> They all three take a
purging Potion, which an&s;wers the Intenti|on,
and perfectly carries off <HI>Mary North's</HI>
Colic Pains.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">
31. The two Men are again purg'd, in
Order to their being di&s;charg'd: And &s;o
likewi&s;e, next Day, are the Women.</P>
<P>And on the Sixth of <HI>September,</HI> they were
all di&s;mi&s;s'd to their &s;everal Counties and
Habitations.</P>
<P>To conclude, The Thing has been &s;uc|ce&s;sful
on all the Five, far beyond my Ex|pectation,
con&s;idering their Age, Habit of
Body, and Circum&s;tances; and it has per|fectly
an&s;wer'd Doctor <HI>Timoni's</HI> Account of
this Practice, and al&s;o the Experience of all
who have &s;een it in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot here forbear mentioning the
very ample Te&s;timony, which Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> an
eminent <HI>Turky</HI> Merchant, one Day gave to
this Experiment, in my Hearing at <HI>Newgate</HI>;
After having &s;een the Per&s;ons ingrafted,
and fully con&s;ider'd their Inci&s;ions and E|ruptions;
He openly declared, they were
the very &s;ame with what he had ever ob|&s;erved
in <HI>Turky,</HI> of which he had &s;een a
great many In&s;tances: And that we might
be a&s;&s;ur'd, none of the&s;e here would ever
be infected with the Small Pox again.</P>
<P>And it is particularly remarkable in this
whole Affair, that tho' there was not the
lea&s;t encouraging or favourable Circum&s;tance
attending it before the Operation; yet
after it, nothing in any &s;ort dangerous or
un&s;ucce&s;sful did happen: Although no Art,
nor &s;timulating Medicine, was made U&s;e of
<PB N="26" REF="29">
to promote the Eruptions; not &s;o much as
to oblige the Patients to keep their Bed; the
whole having been left to Nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by a &s;trict and regular Diet.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2. 1721. After due Preparation
of the Body, I ingrafted <HI>Mary Batt,</HI> an
Infant of two Years and an half old;
Daughter of <HI>Thomas Batt,</HI> a Quaker, living
at <HI>Temple,</HI> within three Miles of <HI>Hertford:</HI>
The red Spots and Flu&s;hings appeared on
her Face and Neck the fourth Day; and
&s;he kept playing about well till the &s;eventh
or eighth, when &s;he became a little heavy
and thir&s;ty, with a fuller and quicker Pul&s;e;
then the Pu&s;tules came out fre&s;h and full,
and the Inci&s;ions di&s;charged a thick well|dige&s;ted
Matter. She had not above 20 in
all upon her; they continued about three
or four Days, then dry'd away and fell off,
and the Child recover'd perfectly.</P>
<P>Thus far all was well; but what hap|pen'd
afterwards was, I mu&s;t own, not a
little &s;urprizing to me, not having &s;een or
ob&s;erv'd any Thing like it before. The
Ca&s;e was in &s;hort this; Six of Mr. <HI>Batt's</HI>
Dome&s;tick Servants, <HI>viz.</HI> four Men and
two Maids, who all, in their Turns, were
wont to hug and care&s;s this Child whil&s;t
under the Operation, and the Pu&s;tules were
out upon her, never &s;u&s;pecting them to be
<PB N="27" REF="30">
catching, nor indeed did I, were all feiz'd
at once with the right natural Small Pox,
of &s;everal and very different kinds; for &s;ome
had the round di&s;tinct Sort, &s;ome the &s;mall
continued, and others the confluent; all of
'em had a great many, but e&s;pecially the
la&s;t, with the u&s;ual bad Symptoms, and very
narrowly e&s;cap'd: But they all (God be
thanked) did well, (except one Maid, that
would not be govern'd under the Di&s;tem|per,
who dy'd of it) and now enjoy a per|fect
State of Health<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Certificates annexed, <HI>pag.</HI> 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12. 1721. I Inoculated <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> Sons of <HI>William Heath</HI> of <HI>Hert|ford</HI>;
the fir&s;t of about &s;even, and the
&s;econd of three Years of Age; both with
the &s;ame <HI>Matter,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time:
the la&s;t had a very gentle and favourable
kind, in all Re&s;pects like the abovenamed
<HI>Mary Batt</HI>; but the fir&s;t, <HI>viz. Jo&s;eph,</HI> be|ing
a fat, foul, gluttonous Boy, who would
not be confined to the Rules and Directions
I had &s;trictly charged his Mother withal,
as to Diet and keeping warm; was taken
very ill before the Eruption, and after it
had a great Load of the continued &s;mall
kind, but at la&s;t recover'd and did well.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">
What a mighty Difference is here to be
ob&s;erved between tho&s;e two Boys! the
Rea&s;on of it &s;eems to be plainly this; The
younger, who had the favourable kind,
was of a clean Habit, moderate Appetite,
and ea&s;ily govern'd during the whole Pro|ce&s;s.
The elder was not only, as I have
&s;aid, of a gro&s;s, foul Con&s;titution, but like|wi&s;e
had a voracious Appetite, always
eating and filling his Belly with the coar&s;e&s;t
Food; as Chee&s;e, fat Country Pudding,
cold boil'd Beef, and the like; which I
&s;aw my &s;elf as I came in by chance, the
third Day after the Operation; nor was
there any Care taken to re&s;train or keep
him within in cold, windy, fro&s;ty Weather;
he once wet his Feet in the Water; in|&s;omuch
that had he taken the Small Pox
by Infection, the World could not have
&s;av'd his Life. Hence it appears how ne|ce&s;&s;ary
it is to clean&s;e thoroughly tho&s;e
foul Habits before the Operation; and
withal to keep them to a very &s;trict <HI>Regimen</HI>
under it.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o here very remarkable, further
to evince the Power of Infection, and the
Genuinene&s;s of the Inoculated Small Pox;
that an Infant of about four Months old,
then on Mrs. <HI>Heath's</HI> Brea&s;t, while &s;he nurs'd
her two Sons, and lay in Bed with them,
was al&s;o &s;eiz'd with the di&s;tinct natural
Kind; and in due Time perfectly recover'd.
<PB N="29" REF="32">
Mrs. <HI>Heath</HI> al&s;o, by being Night and Day
con&s;tantly with her Children, and always
embracing and care&s;&s;ing of 'em, tho' &s;he
had had the Small Pox many Years before,
&s;truck out in &s;everal Pimples or Pu&s;tules on
her Face and Hands, but without any
Thing of Sickne&s;s or Di&s;order: which, we
know, has often happen'd to Nur&s;es, by at|tending
People in this Di&s;temper; and even
by wa&s;hing their Linen.</P>
<P>Not many Days after this, I met Mr.
<HI>Hughes,</HI> Judge Advocate General of his Ma|je&s;ties
Forces, who reque&s;ted me, upon my
Return to <HI>Hertford,</HI> to vi&s;it his two Chil|dren
at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Herting for dbury,</HI> which
I promis'd to do; and found, when I came
there, his Son, a Child of about 18 Months
old, actually ill of the Small Pox; I imme|diately
acquainted Mr. <HI>Hughes,</HI> with this,
and withal remov'd the Daughter, who
was about three Years of Age, to a neigh|bouring
Gentleman's Hou&s;e. Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI>
then recommended to me the particular
Care of his Son, and pray'd me, if the
Small Pox &s;hou'd prove of the favourable
Kind, not to fail to inoculate his Daughter
from him. The Boy had indeed the fair
di&s;tinct Kind, and not a great many, and
recover'd perfectly of them; but afterwards
dy'd of a cancerous Tumour, which had
been breeding in his Cheek and upper Jaw,
<PB N="30" REF="33">
long before his Seizure with the Small Pox.
But to return, I took Matter from him, at
the proper Time, and with it Inoculated his
Si&s;ter, <HI>November 17th,</HI> having fir&s;t gently
purg'd her. The Thing took; &s;he &s;icken'd, the
24<HI>th,</HI> and two Days after the Small Pox ap|pear'd
fair, and continu'd to fill and ripen
to <HI>December</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> then cru&s;ted and gra|dually
fell off in the u&s;ual Manner.</P>
<P>This Young Patient had above two Thou|&s;and
Pu&s;tules or Small Pox upon her, that
came out well, fill'd up, ripen'd and fell
off, ob&s;erving the mo&s;t regular Periods of
the natural Small Pox of the di&s;tinct Kind;
yet &s;he did not keep her Bed one Day, nor
wanted a Nur&s;e to watch with her one
Night during the whole Proce&s;s; never
having been affected with the u&s;ual Com|plaints
and Symptoms of the Natural Small
Pox; nor in the lea&s;t pitted or &s;car'd with
them.</P>
<P>I thought it proper to be the more par|ticular
in relating this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e of the
very fal&s;e Account which had been given
of it in the <HI>Po&s;t Man</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 2, which,
in my Ab&s;ence, the Gentleman him&s;elf was
pleas'd to contradict in the <HI>St. James's
Evening Po&s;t, December</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 17. I Inoculated two of Mr.
<HI>John Colt's</HI> Children, at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Cle|ment's
Lane, Lombard Street:</HI> The one
<PB N="31" REF="34">
a Boy of 7, the other a Girl of about 4 Years
of Age; their Bodies having fir&s;t been duly
prepar'd by a Phy&s;ician's Order. They both
&s;icken'd the 24<HI>th,</HI> the Small Pox appear'd
on the Girl the 26<HI>th,</HI> and on the Boy the
27<HI>th</HI>; they came out gently, fill'd and ripen'd
to the 3<HI>d</HI> and 4<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January</HI>; and then
died away as u&s;ual. Tho&s;e Children had
at lea&s;t 300 Small Pox each, all fair and
round; but the Boy had rather more: His
came out later, and kept out longer too
than his Si&s;ter's; which can only be ac|counted
for (the Ingrafted Matter having
been the &s;ame, and in the &s;ame Quantity) by
the Difference of their Habits and Juices.
In the mean Time, neither of 'em from the
Beginning cou'd be &s;aid to be downright ill;
nor was oblig'd to lie in Bed; nor, in a
Word, was affected with any of the dange|rous
or bad Symptoms ordinarily attending
that Di&s;ea&s;e, or con&s;equential to it.</P>
<P>They being perfectly recover'd; <HI>Satur|day
January</HI> 13<HI>th,</HI> I perform'd the Opera|tion
upon a third Child of the &s;aid Mr.
<HI>Colt</HI>; a Boy of about 6 Years of Age, who
was al&s;o de&s;ign'd to have undergone it
with the other two the Month before, had
it not been that he was then out of Order;
he continu'd chearful and well till the 20<HI>th,</HI>
when he became ill and feveri&s;h; then the
Small Pox appear'd the 22<HI>d,</HI> and three
Days after, the Eruption being quite over,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
they grew fair, round, full and yellow;
like the natural Small Pox of the di&s;tinct
Kind, and thus went on to the 29<HI>th</HI> or
30<HI>th,</HI> when they began to cru&s;t and fall off
after the u&s;ual Manner. This Child had
a great many upon him, like the above|named
Mi&s;s <HI>Hughes</HI>; and is al&s;o perfectly
well recover'd of them: He was vi&s;ited,
while under them (as indeed were the o|ther
two) by &s;everal eminent Phy&s;icians,
and other Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction about the
Town, who all unamiou&s;ly agreed that it
was the right Small Pox, and declar'd
them&s;elves fully &s;atisfied with the Trial.</P>
<P>I do not here take notice of the little
Heats and Flu&s;hings, which appear'd upon
them in the Beginning; nor of the o|ther
more minute Circum&s;tances generally
common to all; nor of the proper Evacua|tions
pre&s;crib'd before and after; that I may
avoid tedious Repetitions, as much as I
am able. But I wou'd beg leave to add one
Ob&s;ervation, the Rea&s;on of which is plain
and obvious, namely, that the greater the
Di&s;charge of Matter at the Inci&s;ions is, the
fewer commonly are the Eruptions; and
on the contrary. Hence al&s;o the great
Advantage of <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> in <HI>This,</HI> and other
cuticular Di&s;ea&s;es, may with great Proba|bility
be evinced and demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>But to conclude: From the&s;e few In&s;tan|ces,
which I have here contracted into the
narrowe&s;t Compa&s;s, &s;everal very obvious and
<PB N="33" REF="36">
u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations might be made, and un|que&s;tionable
Proofs brought, to &s;hew, in
the mo&s;t Satisfactory Manner, that the
Small Pox thus rais'd are of the true and
genuine Kind; that they may be always
given and communicated to proper Subjects,
young or old, without any Danger of a
Relap&s;e; and finally, that this whole Pra|ctice,
prudently manag'd, is always Safe and
U&s;eful, and the I&s;&s;ue ever Certain and Sa|lutary.</P>
