1&s;t, I &s;hall lay down the principles of law
with regard to filiation, or the &s;tate which
every man holds in &s;ociety, and what
ought to be the motives and conduct of
tho&s;e who carry on a proce&s;s to deprive a

&s;hew the motives and conduct of the
plaintiffs in the Douglas cau&s;e. 3dly, I
&s;hall examine the proof which has been
brought again&s;t Mr. Douglas. And 4thly,
I &s;hall &s;tate the proof for Mr. Douglas.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part 1. Filia|tion or Birth|right.</NOTE>Filiation or birthright is of all things
the mo&s;t valuable to mankind; for all the
ble&s;&s;ings and comforts of life, the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of property and of honours, all
the rights and all the affections of blood

<PB N="4" REF="7">
in a &s;trict philo&s;ophical &s;en&s;e, there
is properly no certainty in filiation. But
it is the &s;pirit of law to di&s;regard &s;uch
po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, and not to look for a cer|tainty
in the ab&s;tract, but a legal cer|tainty.
For law, like a kind parent
ever watchful for the good of her chil|dren,
hath e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch &s;olid rules as
may check the unea&s;y waverings of &s;cep|tici&s;m,

life with tranquillity and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acknowledg|ment of parents and general re|port &s;ufficient.</NOTE>Therefore it is, that according to law,
to a&s;certain the birthright of the &s;ubject,

is required than his being acknowledged
by two married per&s;ons as their child,

The bill of 1979 livres which Sir John
carried with him from Rheims, was no|thing
to a man of his character, who was
&s;o di&s;&s;ipated, &s;o profu&s;e, and I will &s;ay,
&s;o generous, that upon his receiving a
&s;um of money, no body could &s;ay how
much of it was engaged for debt, or in|deed,
if half an hour after, a &s;ix pence of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane were anxious to con|ceal from the duke of Douglas their being at Paris, and this fully explained.</NOTE>As I would not &s;plit hairs about every

and Lady Jane were in real poverty, but
&s;urely it cannot be denied that they at

wrote to the duke of Douglas in a very
affecting &s;train upon that head, and they
<PB N="48" REF="51">
borrowed money from M. Andrieux, at
Rheims, with whom they had then very
little connection. That being the ca&s;e,
they were anxious to conceal from the
duke their having gone to Paris; for, &s;aid
they, the duke will be offended at our
&s;eeming extravagance, and will very rea|dily
ob&s;erve, here are two people crying for
want, and yet they have left Rheims and
have taken a fooli&s;h journey to Paris. To
&s;end money to &s;uch people, would be
like throwing it into a &s;ieve.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore they u&s;ed &s;o many methods of con|cealment.</NOTE>Sir John and Lady Jane were thus in a
dilemma. She could give no good rea&s;on
for having left Rheims, as there was
very able a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be had there for
women with child. She had run off in
a pannick, as women in that &s;ituation do
often take mo&s;t unaccountable pannicks.
She and her hu&s;band therefore thought
they had nothing for it but if po&s;&s;ible to
keep this journey from the knowledge of
the duke, therefore it was that they lived
in a private manner at Paris: therefore it
was that they dated their letters at
Rheims; therefore it was that Sir John,
though very fond of his countrymen,
prevailed with him&s;elf to refrain at this
time from &s;eeing them: And &s;o appre|hen&s;ive
were he and Lady Jane that their
being at Paris &s;hould get air, that they

which they were carrying on: but on the
other hand, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the

the&s;e maids as accomplices of the fraud?
If they were accomplices, as the plain|tiffs

would not leave them at Rheims, when
they could be of &s;o much u&s;e to them at

that the differences in&s;i&s;ted on, are in

is, that Sir John's <HI>accoucheur</HI> was called
only <HI>Pierre La Marre,</HI> whereas <HI>Mon&s;ieur
Menager</HI>'s friend was called <HI>Louis Pierre
De la Marre.</HI> This is no more but that
<HI>M. La Marre,</HI> from an affectation of
gentility very common in France, cho&s;e
to put <HI>De</HI> before his &s;irname, which
however he u&s;ually dropt in familiar in|tercour&s;e
or in &s;ub&s;cribing letters; for his
contract of marriage produced by the
plaintiffs being a formal deed, is no proof
<PB N="73" REF="76">
of the manner in which he &s;igned his
letters. His being called <HI>Louis</HI> as well as
<HI>Pierre,</HI> mu&s;t appear a very frivolous ob|jection;
for we all know that people
who have two names in this manner,
often &s;ink one of them. It has been &s;aid
too, that Sir John's <HI>La Marre</HI> was a
<HI>Walloon,</HI> whereas <HI>Menager</HI>'s <HI>La Marre</HI>
is a Frenchman. But the an&s;wer is, that
<HI>Menager</HI>'s <HI>La Marre</HI> was born at <HI>Mon|treuil
&s;ur mer,</HI> upon the borders of the
<HI>Walloon</HI> country, and thence was readily
taken for a <HI>Walloon.</HI> In &s;hort the only
variation of any con&s;equence is that Sir

<HI>La Marre</HI> at &s;o early a period that it
could not be the friend of <HI>Menager.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John Stew|art's declaration candidly con&s;i|dered.</NOTE>In an&s;wer to this, let the candid and

for a &s;trange incorrect memory,
as is proved by the oath of that worthy

mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tances of his for|getfulne&s;s

when Sir John was obliged to make this

<HEAD><PB REF="82">SOME
OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPON &s;eeing in the news papers of
Saturday la&s;t, that <HI>Con&s;iderations on
the Douglas Cau&s;e</HI> were that day publi&s;hed,
and as I had read the proofs and memorials
on that &s;ingularly important que&s;tion, I
immediately &s;ent for the&s;e Con&s;iderations, in
order that I might &s;ee every thing which
&s;hould be publi&s;hed upon a cau&s;e which has
now for years ingro&s;&s;ed the attention of al|mo&s;t
every per&s;on in the united kingdom,
as well as in other countries. In the be|ginning
of the&s;e Con&s;iderations, we are told
that they are compo&s;ed by a per&s;on, <HI>no law|yer,</HI>
and <HI>di&s;connected</HI> with both parties,
who&s;e friends are pretty equally divided in
their wi&s;hes; that it is a que&s;tion of fact;
and that he had often &s;erved on juries, who
are by the laws of Scotland allowed to judge
<PB N="2" REF="83">
in matters of fact. From this preamble, I
imagined that the ob&s;ervations of &s;uch a per&s;on
would contain nothing in favour of either
party, but what was founded in the proof;
and that however far the keenne&s;s of parties
might di&s;po&s;e them to carry their re&s;pective
arguments, an impartial unconnected jury|man
would con&s;ider facts in their true light,
dive&s;ted of all art and fal&s;e colouring. But
how great was my &s;urprize, when in&s;tead
of this I found in the very next page an
in&s;inuation, That of the &s;even judges who
gave their opinions for the defender in Scot|land,
two had been his council and agents,
two appointed his guardians, and a fifth had
&s;uch connections with the defender as had
induced him to decline judging in the pre|liminary
&s;teps of the cau&s;e. The plain mean|ing
of this in&s;inuation is to convey an idea
as if only two of the&s;e &s;even judges were to
be con&s;idered as di&s;connected with the de|fender:
Whereas, on the other &s;ide, only
two of the judges which remained, had the
lea&s;t connection with the pur&s;uers, by
having been of their council. The fact,
however, is, that three of the&s;e eight judges
had been the pur&s;uers council in the law-&s;uits
betwixt duke Hamilton and Mr. Douglas,
and that &s;ome of them and &s;everal others,
are nearly connected with tho&s;e who expect
to be heirs of the duke of Douglas, failing
the defender; whereas none of the &s;even jud|ges
<PB N="3" REF="84">
who gave their opinions for the defender,
have the mo&s;t di&s;tant connection with him.</P>
<P>In the next place, this impartial jury|man,
who by the bye, is clearly &s;ome
hireling employed by the pur&s;uers, (and
who has only a&s;&s;umed the title of a di&s;con|nected
per&s;on, that his Con&s;iderations may
have the greater appearance of impartiality)
goes on to inform, that he begun the exa|mination
of the proofs and memorials with
diffidence; that he believed it an intricate
cau&s;e from the divi&s;ion among the judges;
and that he was careful le&s;t he &s;hould go
wrong, as &s;even, or perhaps eight of the
judges in Scotland had done; but that great
was his a&s;toni&s;hment on finding the cau&s;e
perfectly clear again&s;t the defender. He then
goes on to give his rea&s;ons for being of this
opinion, &s;ome of the mo&s;t material of which I
&s;hall &s;hortly touch upon, and &s;hew that they
are clearly fal&s;e, and no other than an abridge|ment
of the artificial arguments contained
in the plaintiff's memorial.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that Lady Jane before leaving
Aix la Chapelle, in a letter to Mr. Hal|dene,
gave a fal&s;e account of her de&s;tina|tion,
which was prudent, if a fraud was
intended, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e &s;he might have
been watched. That &s;he declined &s;taying
at Liege, and left Rheims upon the fal&s;e
pretence of want of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="85">
It is not true that ever Lady Jane con|cealed
or gave a fal&s;e account of her de&s;tina|tion
on leaving Aix&mdash;for &s;ome time, it is
perfectly clear &s;he intended to have gone to
Geneva, and there after changed her mind;
when &s;he did &s;o, &s;he made no &s;ecret of the
place of her de&s;tination, told the whole cir|cle
of her acquaintance at Aix that &s;he was
going to Rheims, pre&s;&s;ed Lady Wigton
come and live with her there, and cau&s;ed
to write to a per&s;on to take a hou&s;e for her.
She mentioned it to her whole acquaintances
at Liege, at which place &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly
&s;tay, as it is the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable place in
Germany, and &s;he had by this time given
orders to take a hou&s;e for her at Rheims.
Immediately on her arrival at Rheims,
&s;he wrote to every per&s;on with whom &s;he
had occa&s;ion to corre&s;pond, and even invited
Lord Crawford to come and vi&s;it them there.
That after &s;he had &s;taid &s;ome time at
Rheims, &s;he was advi&s;ed to go to Paris,
on account of the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of Accou|cheurs
at Rheims, is al&s;o clearly in proof,
and not the ve&s;tige of evidence to the con|trary;
&s;o that this very &s;u&s;picious circum|&s;tance
is fal&s;e from beginning to end.</P>
<P>This juryman next &s;ays, that &s;o far were
they on leaving Rheims from acquainting
Mr. Mailfer of the motives of their journey
<PB N="5" REF="86">
to Paris, that they tell him, that the object
of their journey was to make purcha&s;es.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary that a per&s;on
&s;hould tell an ab&s;olute untruth in an affair
of this &s;erious nature. Sir John never told
Mr. Mailfer that his bu&s;ine&s;s to Paris was to
make purcha&s;es, nor does Mr. Mailfer &s;ay &s;o
in any part of the letter to Godfrey; and if
Mailfer had &s;aid it, which he does not, it
would have been ab&s;urd from hence to have
argued that the motive of the journey was
concealed, as it is clearly in proof that it
was known to the whole town of Rheims.</P>
<P>Again it is &s;aid, that Lady Jane avoided
giving any detail of what pa&s;t in Paris, and
never was heard to mention any particular
relative to the birth of her &s;ons; only that
on being pre&s;&s;ed by Lady Stair, &s;he &s;aid &s;he
had been delivered within two or three
hours of her arrival at Paris,&mdash;but that the
&s;crutiny which has been &s;ince made, obliges
the defender to give up this account of Lady
Jane's.</P>
<P>This again is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, and con|trary
to clear evidence. Lady Jane did, in
her own life time, mention all the circum|&s;tances
of her delivery, the time when, the
per&s;on in who&s;e hou&s;e, and the Accoucheur
by whom. The evidence of Lady Jane's
<PB N="6" REF="87">
having &s;aid &s;he was delivered within two or
three hours of her arrival in Paris, is of a very
&s;ingular nature. The hear&s;ay of a hear&s;ay
from Lady Stair, then almo&s;t 80 years of
age, and remarkably deaf, &s;worn to by her
daughter, Mrs. Primro&s;e, at the di&s;tance of
many years; and who, at the time of
giving her oath, is above 60 years of age.
This very witne&s;s too has, from want of
memory, &s;worn &s;undry things which are
not true, and clearly di&s;proved; con&s;equent|ly
this part of her oath is not very much to
be depended upon, and is al&s;o contradicted
by po&s;itive te&s;timony. It is an ab&s;olute un|truth,
that the defender is forced out of
this account given by Lady Jane, by the
&s;crutiny &s;ince made. At the defender's &s;er|vice,
when no &s;crutiny had been made, the
time, the place, and every circum&s;tance of the
birth was mentioned, in the &s;ame manner as
at pre&s;ent. If Mrs. Hewit had &s;aid at the
&s;ervice, that Lady Jane had been brought
to bed in three hours after her arrival at Pa|ris;
and it had now been in&s;i&s;ted, it was
&s;ix days after, what this impartial Scotch
jury-man &s;ays, would have been true; but as
it is otherwi&s;e, it is an ab&s;olute fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>He next &s;ays, Sir John's examination was
taken in pre&s;ence of the Lords, with great
deliberation, and la&s;ted three days; and
yet that the defender wants to reject it as
<PB N="7" REF="88">
fal&s;e in every article; and to &s;ub&s;titute ano|ther
La Marre, in place of Sir John's La
Marre, with the aid of one Mr. Menager,
who depo&s;es to a delivery performed by La
Marre; but which cannot be that of Lady
Jane, as it happened in the year 1746.</P>
<P>This is as unfair as any of his former
ob&s;ervations. The defender never has, &s;o
far as I can ob&s;erve from his memorial, re|jected
any one part of Sir John's declaration
as fal&s;e; he has owned, that from his great
age, then 74 years, and &s;ickly &s;tate,
having been rai&s;ed out of bed to attend the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, he had fallen into &s;ome in|con&s;iderable
mi&s;takes, in an&s;wering que&s;ti|ons
as to facts, which happened &s;ixteen
years before. I &s;ee it is a&s;&s;erted, and not
denied, that he behaved on that occa&s;ion,
with uncommon ea&s;e and unconcern, which
would have been impo&s;&s;ible if he had been
guilty of the crime this Jury-man &s;uppo&s;es;
and &s;o far as I can ob&s;erve from the printed
&s;peeches of the judges, none of them have
in&s;inuated, that he did not behave on that
occa&s;ion, in the mo&s;t proper manner. As
to the delivery mentioned by Mr. Menager,
having happened in the year 1746, this is
clearly not true, as there is the mo&s;t unde|niable
evidence of its having happened &s;ub|&s;equent
to La Marre's marriage, which was
in the 1747, and in &s;ummer 1748, when he
<PB N="8" REF="89">
gave out Sholto to be nur&s;ed upon the milk
of a woman near Paris, who&s;e child was
born in March 1748.</P>
<P>It is next &s;aid, that the only time Sir
John mentioned real per&s;ons, was in a note
to Mrs. Napier, in the year 1756, when
he mentioned Michelle's as the place of de|livery,
imagining that that family would,
by that time, at the di&s;tance of 8 years,
have been dead; but finding that they had
been found out, he &s;hifted the &s;cene, and
placed it in the hou&s;e of the ideal Madame
Le Brun, who was then mentioned for the
fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>This too is as untrue as any of his for|mer
ob&s;ervations. Sir John mentioned one
landlady in place of another, by mere unin|tended
mi&s;take. La Brun's had been men|tioned
in Lady Jane's life time, as the place
of her delivery, &s;o that it was not on the Mi|chelle
family being found out, and denying
that the delivery happened in their hou&s;e that
&s;he was fir&s;t mentioned. And the re&s;ult of
the enquiries by Principal Gordon, never was
communicated to Sir John, con&s;equently he
could not vary the place, on being inform|ed
of that enquiry.</P>
<P>He next &s;ays, that if a Scotch Lady of
quality had been really delivered of twins
<PB N="9" REF="90">
in the hou&s;e of Le Brun, and by a La Marre,
their whole friends, acquaintances, and
neighbours, would have heard of it; and
that every per&s;on in who&s;e hou&s;e they ever
lodged abroad, remember them; and that
every other per&s;on, except La Marre, and Le
Brun, the&s;e precious people, as they are
called, have been found.</P>
<P>To this it is, in the fir&s;t place, to be no|ticed,
that the only title Lady Jane took,
either at Paris or at Rheims, was that of
Madame Stewart, and that the wife of the
meane&s;t per&s;on in France is called Madame;
&s;uch as the noted Madame Mignion, Ma|dame
Sanry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who are common beg|gars;
&s;o that her being a lady of quality
was not &s;o much as known, and the de|livery
of a lady of twins was &s;urely no ex|traordinary
affair. And it is not true, that
every per&s;on with whom they lodged, ex|cept
Le Brun, has been found. The land|ladies
at Sedan are not found out. The per|&s;on
in who&s;e hou&s;e they lived after leaving
Godefroi's, and before entering to Michelle's,
has not been found out; and the nur&s;e
brought to Michelle's, as well as Sir John's
&s;ervant Quibil, one of Godefroi's &s;ervants,
and &s;everal per&s;ons of this very name of Le
Brun, who at that time had hou&s;es in Paris,
are not found out; all of whom are admit|ted
<PB N="10" REF="91">
to have exi&s;ted: and there is the clear|e&s;t
evidence po&s;&s;ible of La Mar's exi&s;tence,
and of his death; of his having brought
Lady Jane to bed, and told it to &s;undry of
his acquaintances.</P>
<P>The Juryman then &s;ays, that they ar|rived
at Godefroi's on the 4th, where they
are proved by his books and oath to have
remained till the 14th; he does not &s;ay
where they were from the 14th to the 18th,
when he &s;ays they arrived at Michelle's;
that therefore Lady Jane could not have
been delivered on the 10th of July in Le
Brun's; and Mrs. Hewit has been guilty of
wilful perjury in &s;aying Lady Jane remained
in childbed nine days. And this being the
ca&s;e, what credit, &s;ays he, can be given to
any thing &s;he or Sir John can &s;ay?</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered the evidence of this
man Godefroi, and of his books, with as
much attention, and with much le&s;s partia|lity,
than this Juryman; and I confe&s;s I
never &s;aw &s;uch a burle&s;que upon evidence.
An inn-keeper &s;wearing at the di&s;tance of
eighteen years to the particular days of the
week and month when a per&s;on or company
entered to his hou&s;e, what rooms they oc|cupied,
and how many days they &s;taid, is
&s;uch a memory as never was heard of before.
<PB N="11" REF="92">
There are no &s;uch per&s;ons as Lady Jane and
Sir John in his whole books in July 1748,
&s;o that the books can never be of the lea&s;t
avail. There are indeed &s;ome arguments in
the pur&s;uers memorial, to &s;hew that a blank
account in this man's book mu&s;t apply to
Sir John; but this appears to me ab&s;olutely
chimerical: &s;o it is unnece&s;&s;ary, and indeed
I have not time, to an&s;wer them.&mdash;It is not
true, nor indeed is there the &s;hadow of evi|dence,
that they arrived at Michelle's on
the 18th, or &s;ooner than the 19th at night,
or 20th July. But as the pur&s;uers in their
memorial have &s;aid &s;o, this impartial, di&s;|intere&s;ted,
and judicious Juryman, takes it
for granted, though contrary to the cleare&s;t
evidence, if he had taken the trouble to
look at it.</P>
<P>He next goes on to mention the enleve|ment
of a child from one Mignion, and
&s;ays, that when he was given away, <HI>his
mother in&s;i&s;ted upon leaving her own &s;wadling-cloaths,
of a coar&s;e kind of blanket</HI>; <HI>and
this coar&s;e blanket</HI> was found on the de|fender
when he was given to Favre; &s;o
that he mu&s;t be Mignion's child.</P>
<P>It is amazing what lengths party or in|tere&s;t
will carry a per&s;on to, in que&s;tions
which de&s;erve the mo&s;t unbia&s;&s;ed con&s;ide|ration.
<PB N="12" REF="93">
Madame Mignion, perjured as &s;he
is admitted to be, in favour of the pur|&s;uers,
does not even &s;ay that the bit of dre&s;s
left with her child was of blanket; and as
little does Favre &s;ay, that what &s;he de&s;cribes
as molton or blanketing was a bit inferior
to the other parts of the defender's dre&s;s.
There never were two children &s;een who&s;e
de&s;criptions agree le&s;s with each other, than
that of Mignion's child and the defender,
in dre&s;s, colour, &s;trength, eyes, and every
thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>From page 33. to page 43. this Juryman
accu&s;es Lady Jane of fal&s;hood, of flattery,
of duplicity, and I know not what, for no
other rea&s;on, than that &s;he, in one of her
letters, commends two young gentlemen
&s;he met with at the Hague;&mdash;that &s;he is in
a pa&s;&s;ion with one of her relations for &s;ay|ing
&s;he is living at Wind&s;or, under a bor|rowed
name, with Col. Stewart; and that
&s;he denied her marriage to Lady Catharine
Wemy&s;s, at a time &s;he was keeping it a &s;e|cret
from all the world.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on of her high rank, and remark|able
good character for religion, good &s;en&s;e,
and other amiable accompli&s;hments, is to
be abu&s;ed in the manner this hireling (for
he can be nothing el&s;e) has done Lady Jane,
<PB N="13" REF="94">
for &s;uch rea&s;ons as the&s;e, it is certain no
woman on earth can po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape falling
a &s;acrifice to the &s;pite of &s;uch illiberal, bad|hearted
people. It is very true, that if &s;he
was now alive, &s;he would probably think
differently of &s;ome of tho&s;e young gentle|men,
of whom &s;he had then &s;o good an opi|nion.
From her own letter, &s;he had much
rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied at the per&s;on &s;he is
angry with for many fal&s;hoods &s;he had
rai&s;ed to her prejudice; and her denying
her marriage does not, in her circum&s;tan|ces,
appear to me at all culpable. If people
are to judge of one's character from their
writings, the author of the&s;e Con&s;iderations,
if he is as di&s;intere&s;ted in this &s;uit as he pre|tends,
is &s;urely a very bad hearted man:
for, at the very time he is employed in
writing the&s;e Con&s;iderations, he mu&s;t have
been &s;en&s;ible he was &s;aying many things
which are ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, with an inten|tion
to prejudice the world again&s;t a young
man who never offended him.</P>
<P>He next &s;ays that Sholto was left &s;ixteen
months at Paris, under the care of La
Marre, and that if he had died in the mean
time, no per&s;on knew where the child was,
&s;o he mu&s;t have been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir John knew well at the time where
the child was at nur&s;e, he had &s;een him fre|quently
<PB N="14" REF="95">
when at Paris. He had vi&s;ited him
from Damartine; he had wrote to Lady Jane
an account of his health from Paris to that
place, as appears from Mrs. Hewit's letter
to the maids. He returned to Paris in Oc|tober
1748, and carried cloaths with him
for the child; he went back again in the
Spring 1749, for no other purpo&s;e but to
&s;ee the child. How then can this man &s;ay
that if La Marre had died the child would
have been lo&s;t? The only rea&s;on he has is,
that Sir John &s;ays, when examined, in the
year 1762, in the 74th year of his age, that
he did not then remember the place where
&s;he had lived in the year 1748.</P>
<P>The Juryman then goes on to &s;tate, that
when Sir John and Lady Jane were about to
return to Britain, they went from Rheims
to Paris, under the pretence of bringing away
their &s;econd child, that during the eight days
they were then at Paris, a child of one Sanry
was carried off from his father, by one
Duvern&eacute;, who was aged about &s;ixty, and
that this Duvern&eacute; was no other than Sir
John Stewart, and the child Sholto.</P>
<P>As to this charge, without entering much
into the particulars, it is as clear as &s;un|&s;hine
that the child of Sanry and Sholto
were different. The proof of the exi&s;tence
of Sholto from his birth in July 1748,
<PB N="15" REF="96">
is to me convincing, Sanry's child was four
months older than the defender; yet Sholto
was much le&s;s and weaker than his brother,
as had been uniformly given out. Sanry's
child was walking and &s;peaking when car|ried
off, and yet the evidence is clear that
Sholto did neither when brought to Eng|land,
and for &s;ome time after: and every
one of the pur&s;uers witne&s;&s;es &s;ay, that appli|cation
was made to the lieutenant of police
to make a &s;earch for the per&s;ons who carried
off this child, within two or three days after
he was taken away from his parents; and
there is the mo&s;t &s;atisfying evidence that
this magi&s;trate was not applied to till the
10th of January 1750, &s;everal weeks before
which time Sir John had left Rheims, on
his return to England, with both his chil|dren,
&s;o that he could not po&s;&s;ibly have had
the lea&s;t connection with this pretended en|levement.</P>
<P>His arguments upon the &s;uppo&s;ed
impo&s;&s;ibility of their not writing to Paris,
when they heard of the &s;u&s;picions as to
the legitimacy of their children, their
writing to Aix for certificates of the preg|nancy,
&amp;c. are not worth minding, they
are trivial and totally immaterial: only it is
very clearly proved, that they took the ad|vice
of a gentleman very eminent in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
then a lawyer, if they ought to do
<PB N="16" REF="97">
&s;o, and were a&s;&s;ured it was highly unne|ce&s;&s;ary
and improper; and had they, upon
fal&s;e reports rai&s;ed in the manner the&s;e have
been proved to have been, given them&s;elves
the trouble of obtaining certificates, they
would rather have increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed
the &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>What he has &s;aid as to Godefroi is al|ready
noticed, and it is needle&s;s to take
more time upon it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>His ob&s;ervations upon Lady Jane's preg|nancy
are puerile and trifling to the highe&s;t
degree. If ever woman on earth was with
child during the whole nine months prior to
the birth, Lady Jane Douglas was. Her
appearance of pregnancy was not &s;udden,
as alledged by this author, but gradual;
ob&s;erved by her &s;ervants and the people
about her from the fir&s;t hour, and conti|nued
gradually increa&s;ing till &s;he was deli|vered
of the defender and his twin brother.
The &s;uppo&s;al of her appearance of preg|nancy
being &s;tronger at Aix than at Rheims
is ridiculous, when it is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was
at this very time deceiving on&egrave; of her own
maid &s;ervants who was about her at both
the&s;e places.</P>
<P>This author concludes with an idle and
unnece&s;&s;ary account of the popularity of
<PB N="17" REF="98">
the defender and his cau&s;e in Scotland; that
the whole country were incen&s;ed at the
judgment; but that the judicious and mo&s;t
valuable part of &s;ociety, though perhaps the
lea&s;t numerous, applauded the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e of this declamation I do not
&s;ee; nor did I ever hear who the valuable
part of &s;ociety alluded to are, unle&s;s they
be the tutors of Duke Hamilton,&mdash;the heirs
of line of the Duke of Douglas, and their
friends, and &s;ome of the authors of the
&s;candalous reports which were fal&s;ely rai&s;ed
again&s;t Lady Jane.</P>
<P>This gentleman however is plea&s;ed to &s;ay
that every humane heart mu&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate
the defender; and that he applauds his pa|trone&s;s,
by whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, he means
the Duche&s;s of Douglas, for her unwearied
&s;upport of him.</P>
<P>Whether this gentleman is one of the&s;e
humane hearted people will appear from his
pamphlet. The defender, I am per&s;uaded,
de&s;pi&s;es his pity as much as his pamphlet,
and as much as the Duche&s;s of Douglas, if I
am not much mi&s;taken of her character, does
his prai&s;es. She has done what &s;he thought
her duty, and what &s;he owed to the fa|mily
of Douglas in &s;upporting it, and pro|tecting
a young man of uncommon merit,
<PB N="18" REF="99">
again&s;t a very extraordinary combination of
the mo&s;t relentle&s;s, implacable and malici|ous
enemies. Neither &s;he or her pupil
have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt of obtaining
that ju&s;tice in another country which they
have been refu&s;ed in their own.</P>
