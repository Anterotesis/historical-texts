<P>THE Author's De&s;ign being to con|&s;ider the Free-thinker in the va|rious Lights of Athei&s;t, Libertine, Enthu&s;ia&s;t, Scorner, Critic, Metaphy&s;ici|an, Fatali&s;t, and Sceptic, it mu&s;t not therefore be imagined, that every one of the&s;e Characters agrees with every indi|vidual Free-thinker, no more being im|plied, than that each Part agrees with &s;ome or other of the Sect. There may po&s;&s;ibly be a Reader who &s;hall think the Character of Athei&s;t agrees with none: But though it hath been often &s;aid, there is no &s;uch thing as a Speculative Athei&s;t; yet we mu&s;t allow, there are &s;everal A|thei&s;ts who pretend to Speculation. This the Author knows to be true; and is well a&s;&s;ured, that one of the mo&s;t noted Wri|ters again&s;t Chri&s;tianity in our Times, de|clared, he had found out a Demon&s;tra|tion again&s;t the Being of a God. And he doubts not, whoever will be at the pains
<PB REF="3">
to inform him&s;elf, by a general Conver|&s;ation, as well as Books, of the Principles and Tenets of our modern Free-thinkers, will &s;ee too much Cau&s;e to be per&s;uaded that nothing in the en&s;uing Characters is beyond the Life. As for the Treati&s;e concerning VISION, why the Author annexed it to the MINUTE PHILOSO|PHER, will appear upon Peru&s;al of the Fourth Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_I Flattered my &s;elf, <HI>Theages,</HI> that before this time I might have been able to have &s;ent you an agreeable Account of the Succe&s;s of the Affair, which brought me into this remote corner of the Country. But in&s;tead of this, I &s;hou'd now give you the Detail of its Mi&s;carriage,
<PB N="2" REF="11">
if I did not rather choo&s;e to entertain you with &s;ome amu&s;ing Incidents, which have helped to make me ea&s;y under a Circum&s;tance I cou'd neither obviate nor fore&s;ee. Events are not in our power; but it always is, to make a good u&s;e even of the very wor&s;t. And I mu&s;t needs own, the Cour&s;e and Event of this Affair gave opportunity for Reflections, that make me &s;ome amends for a great lo&s;s of Time, Pains, and Expence. A Life of Action, which takes its I&s;&s;ue from the Coun|&s;els, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Views of other Men, if it doth not draw a Man to imitate, will at lea&s;t teach him to ob|&s;erve. And a Mind at liberty to reflect on its own Ob|&s;ervations, if it produce nothing u&s;eful to the World, &s;eldom fails of Entertainment to it &s;elf. For &s;everal Months pa&s;t I have enjoy'd &s;uch Liberty and Lei&s;ure in this di&s;tant Retreat, far beyond the Verge of that great Whirlpool of Bu&s;ine&s;s, Faction, and Plea|&s;ure, which is called <HI>the World.</HI> And a Retreat in it &s;elf agreeable, after a long Scene of Trouble and Di&s;|quiet, was made much more &s;o by the Conver&s;ation and good Qualities of my Ho&s;t <HI>Euphranor,</HI> who unites in his own Per&s;on the Philo&s;opher and the Farmer, two Characters not &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent in nature as by Cu|&s;tom they &s;eem to be. <HI>Euphranor,</HI> from the time he left the Univer&s;ity, hath lived in this &s;mall Town, where he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a convenient Hou&s;e with a hundred Acres of Land adjoining to it; which being improved by his own Labour, yield him a plentiful Sub&s;i&s;tence. He hath a good Collection, chiefly of old Books, left him by a Clergyman his Uncle, under who&s;e Care he was brought up. And the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Farm doth not hinder him from making good u&s;e of it. He hath read much, and thought more; his Health and Strength of Body enabling him the better to bear Fatigue of Mind. He is of opinion that he cou'd not carry on his Studies with more Advantage in the Clo&s;et than the Field, where his Mind is &s;eldom idle while he prunes the Trees, follows the Plough, or looks after his Flocks. In the Hou&s;e of this hone&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Friend I became acquainted with <HI>Crito,</HI> a neighbour|ing Gentleman of di&s;tingui&s;hed Merit and E&s;tate, who lives in great Friend&s;hip with <HI>Euphranor.</HI> La&s;t Summer, <HI>Crito,</HI> who&s;e Pari&s;h-Church is in our Town, dining on a Sunday at <HI>Euphranor</HI>'s, I happened to in|quire after his Gue&s;ts, whom we had &s;een at Church with him the Sunday before. They are both well, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> but, having once occa&s;ionally conformed, to &s;ee what &s;ort of A&s;&s;embly our Pari&s;h cou'd afford, they had no farther Curio&s;ity to gratify at Church, and &s;o cho&s;e to &s;tay at home. How, &s;aid <HI>Euphranor,</HI> are they then Di&s;&s;enters? No, replied <HI>Crito,</HI> they are Free-thinkers. <HI>Euphranor,</HI> who had never met with any of this Species or Sect of Men, and but little of their Writings, &s;hew'd a great De&s;ire to know their Principles or Sy&s;tem. That is more, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> than I will undertake to tell you. Their Writers are of dif|ferent Opinions. Some go farther, and explain them|&s;elves more freely than others. But the current gene|ral Notions of the Sect are be&s;t learned from Conver|&s;ation with tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves of it. Your Curio&s;ity may now be &s;atisfy'd, if you and <HI>Dion</HI> wou'd &s;pend a Week at my Hou&s;e with the&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;eem very ready to declare and propagate their O|pinions. <HI>Alciphron</HI> is above Forty, and no &s;tranger either to Men or Books. I knew him fir&s;t at the Temple, which, upon an E&s;tate's falling to him, he quitted, to travel through the polite parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Since his Return he hath lived in the Amu&s;ements of the Town, which being grown &s;tale and ta&s;tele&s;s to his Palate, have flung him into a &s;ort of &s;plenetic Indo|lence. The young Gentleman, <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> is a near Kin&s;|man of mine, one of lively Parts, and a general In&s;ight into Letters, who, after having pa&s;&s;ed the Forms of Education, and &s;een a little of the World, fell into an Intimacy with Men of Plea&s;ure, and Free-thinkers, I am afraid much to the damage of his Con&s;titution and his Fortune. But what I mo&s;t regret, is the Corruption of his Mind by a Set of pernicious Prin|ciples,
<PB N="4" REF="13">
which, having been ob&s;erved to &s;urvive the Pa&s;&s;ions of Youth, fore&s;tal even the remote Hopes of Amendment. They are both Men of Fa&s;hion, and wou'd be agreeable enough, if they did not fancy them&s;elves Free-thinkers. But this, to &s;peak the Truth, has given them a certain Air and Manner, which a little too vi&s;ibly declare they think them|&s;elves wi&s;er than the re&s;t of the World. I &s;hou'd therefore be not at all di&s;plea&s;ed if my Gue&s;ts met with their Match, where they lea&s;t expected it, in a Country Farmer. I &s;hall not, replied <HI>Euphranor,</HI> pre|tend to any more than barely to inform my &s;elf of their Principles and Opinions. For this end I propo&s;e to|morrow to &s;et a Week's Task to my Labourers, and accept your Invitation, if <HI>Dion</HI> thinks good. To which I give con&s;ent. Mean while, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> I &s;hall prepare my Gue&s;ts, and let them know that an hone&s;t Neighbour hath a mind to di&s;cour&s;e them on the Subject of their Free-thinking. And, if I am not much mi&s;taken, they will plea&s;e them&s;elves with the Pro&s;pect of leaving a Convert behind them, even in a Country Village. Next Morning <HI>Euphanor</HI> ro&s;e early, and &s;pent the Forenoon in ordering his Affairs. After Dinner we took our Walk to <HI>Crito</HI>'s, which lay through half a dozen plea&s;ant Fields planted round with Plane-trees, that are very common in this part of the Country. We walked under the delicious Shade of the&s;e Trees for about an Hour before we came to <HI>Crito</HI>'s Hou&s;e, which &s;tands in the middle of a &s;mall Park, beautify'd with two fine Groves of Oak and Walnut, and a winding Stream of &s;weet and clear Water. We met a Servant at the Door with a &s;mall Basket of Fruit which he was carrying into a Grove, where he &s;aid his Ma&s;ter was with the two Strangers, we found them all three &s;itting under a Shade. And af|ter the u&s;ual Forms at fir&s;t meeting, <HI>Euphranor</HI> and I &s;at down by them. Our Conver&s;ation began upon the Beauty of this rural Scene, the fine Sea&s;on of the Year, and &s;ome late Improvements which had been
<PB N="5" REF="14">
made in the adjacent Country by new Methods of A|griculture. Whence <HI>Alciphron</HI> took occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve, That the mo&s;t valuable Improvements came late&s;t. I &s;hould have &s;mall Temptation, &s;aid he, to live where Men have neither poli&s;hed Manners, nor improved Minds, though the Face of the Country were ever &s;o well improved. But I have long ob&s;er|ved, that there is a gradual Progre&s;s in humane Af|fairs. The fir&s;t Care of Mankind is to &s;upply the Cravings of Nature; in the next place they &s;tudy the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life. But the &s;ub|duing Prejudices, and acquiring true Knowledge, that <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour is the la&s;t, being what demands the mo&s;t perfect Abilities, and to which all other Ad|vantages are preparative. Right, &s;aid <HI>Euphranor, Al|ciphron</HI> hath touched our true Defect. It was always my Opinion, That as &s;oon as we had provided Sub|&s;i&s;tence for the Body, our next Care &s;hould be to im|prove the Mind. But the De&s;ire of Wealth &s;teps be|tween and engro&s;&s;eth Mens Thoughts.</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> Thought is that which we are told di&s;tingui&s;heth Man from Bea&s;t; and Freedom of Thought makes as great a difference between Man and Man. It is to the noble A&s;&s;erters of this Privilege and Perfection of humane Kind, the Free-thinkers I mean, who have &s;prung up and multiplied of late Years, that we are indebted for all tho&s;e important Di&s;coveries, that Ocean of Light which hath broke in and made its way, in &s;pight of Slavery and Super|&s;tition. <HI>Euphranor,</HI> who is a &s;incere Enemy to both, te&s;tified a great E&s;teem for tho&s;e Worthies who had pre&s;erved their Country from being ruined by them, having &s;pread &s;o much Light and Knowledge over the Land. He added, That he liked the Name and Character of a Free-thinker: but in his Sen&s;e of the Word, every hone&s;t Inquirer after Truth in any Age or Country was intitled to it. He therefore de&s;ired to know what this Sect was that <HI>Alciphron</HI> had &s;poken
<PB N="6" REF="15">
of as newly &s;prung up; what were their Tenets; what were their Di&s;coveries; and wherein they em|ploy'd them&s;elves, for the benefit of Mankind? Of all which, he &s;hou'd think him&s;elf obliged, if <HI>Alci|phron</HI> wou'd inform him. That I &s;hall very ea&s;ily, re|plied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> for I profe&s;s my &s;elf one of the num|ber, and my mo&s;t intimate Friends are &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among them. And perceiving that <HI>Euphranor</HI> heard him with re&s;pect, he proceeded very fluently. You mu&s;t know, &s;aid he, that the mind of Man may be fitly compared to a piece of Land. What &s;tubbing, plowing, digging and harrowing is to the one, that thinking, reflecting, examining is to the other. Each hath its proper culture; and as Land that is &s;uffered to lie wa&s;te and wild for a long tract of time will be over&s;pread with bru&s;h-wood, brambles, thorns and &s;uch vegetables which have neither u&s;e nor beauty; even &s;o there will not fail to &s;prout up in a neglected uncultivated mind, a great number of pre|judices and ab&s;urd opinions, which owe their origin partly to the Soil it &s;elf, the pa&s;&s;ions and imperfecti|ons of the mind of Man, and partly to tho&s;e Seeds which chance to be &s;cattered in it by every wind of Doctrine, which the cunning of State&s;men, the &s;in|gularity of Pedants, the &s;uper&s;tition of Fools or the impo&s;ture of Prie&s;ts &s;hall rai&s;e. Repre&s;ent to your &s;elf the mind of Man or humane Nature in general, that for &s;o many ages had lain obnoxious to the frauds of de&s;igning and the follies of weak Men. How it mu&s;t be over-run with prejudices and errors, what firm and deep Roots they mu&s;t have taken, and con|&s;equently how difficult a task it mu&s;t be to extirpate them? And yet this work no le&s;s difficult than glo|rious is the employment of the modern Free-thinkers. <HI>Alciphron</HI> having &s;aid this made a pau&s;e, and looked round on the Company. Truly, &s;aid I, a very lauda|ble undertaking! We think, &s;aid <HI>Euphranor,</HI> that it is prai&s;e-worthy to clear and &s;ubdue the earth, to tame brute Animals, to fa&s;hion the out&s;ides of Men, pro|vide
<PB N="7" REF="16">
&s;u&s;tenance for their Bodies, and cure their Mala|dies. But what is all this in compari&s;on of that mo&s;t excellent and u&s;eful undertaking to free Mankind from their errors, and to improve and adorn their minds? For things of le&s;s merit towards the world, Altars have been rai&s;ed and Temples built in antient times. Too many in our days, replied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> are &s;uch Fools as not to know their be&s;t Benefactors from their wor&s;t Enemies. They have a blind re&s;pect for tho&s;e who en&s;lave them, and look upon their Deli|verers as a dangerous &s;ort of Men that wou'd under|mine received Principles and Opinions. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It were a great pity &s;uch worthy ingenious Men &s;hou'd meet with any di&s;couragement. For my part I &s;hou'd think, a Man who &s;pent his time in &s;uch a painful im|partial &s;earch after Truth a better friend to Mankind than the greate&s;t State&s;man or Hero, the advantage of who&s;e Labours is confined to a little part of the world, and a &s;hort &s;pace of time, whereas a Ray of Truth may enlighten the whole world and extend to future ages. <HI>ALC.</HI> It will be &s;ome time I fear before the common herd think as you do.

And <HI>Alciphron</HI> with an air of pity told <HI>Euphranor</HI> that he perceived he was unac|quainted with the real character of tho&s;e Men. For, &s;aith he, you mu&s;t know that of all Men living they are our greate&s;t Enemies.

<PB N="8" REF="17">
their writings, I &s;hou'd have thought lovers of lear|ning and u&s;eful knowledge. <HI>ALC.</HI> Take my word for it, Prie&s;ts of all Religions are the &s;ame, wherever there are Prie&s;ts there will be Prie&s;tcraft, and where|ever there is Prie&s;tcraft there will be a per&s;ecuting Spirit, which they never fail to exert to the utmo&s;t of their power again&s;t all tho&s;e who have the courage to think for them&s;elves, and will not &s;ubmit to be hoodwinked and manacled by their Reverend Leaders. Tho&s;e great Ma&s;ters of Pedantry and Jargon have coined &s;everal Sy&s;tems, which are all equally true and of equal importance to the world. The contending Sects are each alike fond of their own, and alike prone to di&s;charge their fury upon all who di&s;&s;ent from them. Cruelty and Ambition being the darling vices of Prie&s;ts and Churchmen all the world over, they endeavour in all Countries to get an a&s;cendant over the re&s;t of mankind, and the Magi&s;trate having a joint intere&s;t with the Prie&s;t in &s;ubduing, amu&s;ing, and &s;caring the People, too often lends a hand to the Hie|rarchy, who never think their authority and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons &s;ecure, &s;o long as tho&s;e who differ from them in opinion are allowed to partake even in the common rights belonging to their birth or &s;pecies. To repre|&s;ent the matter in a true light, figure to your &s;elves a mon&s;ter or &s;pectre made up of Super&s;tition and En|thu&s;ia&s;m, the joint i&s;&s;ue of Statecraft and Prie&s;tcraft, rattling chains in one hand and with the other bran|di&s;hing a flaming Sword over the Land, and menacing de&s;truction to all who &s;hall dare to follow the dictates of Rea&s;on and common Sen&s;e. Do but con&s;ider this, and then &s;ay if there was not danger as well as difficul|ty in our undertaking. Yet, &s;uch is the generous ar|dour that Truth in&s;pires, our Free-thinkers are nei|ther overcome by the one nor daunted by the other. In &s;pight of both we have already made &s;o many Pro|&s;elytes among the better &s;ort, and their numbers in|crea&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, that we hope we &s;hall be able to carry all before us, beat down the Bulwarks of all Tyranny,

The more innocent and hone&s;t a Man is, the more li|able is he to be impo&s;ed on by the &s;pecious pretences of other Men. You have probably met with certain writings of our Divines that treat of grace, virtue, goodne&s;s and &s;uch matters fit to amu&s;e and deceive a &s;imple hone&s;t mind. But believe me when I tell you they are all at bottom (however they may gild their de&s;igns) united by one common principle in the &s;ame Intere&s;t. I will not deny there may be here and there a poor half-witted Man that means no mi&s;chief; but this I will be bold to &s;ay that all the Men of Sen&s;e a|mong them are true at bottom to the&s;e three pur&s;uits of ambition, avarice and revenge.</P>

<P>While <HI>Alciphron</HI> was &s;peaking, a Servant came to tell him and <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> that &s;ome Men who were go|ing to <HI>London</HI> waited to receive their orders. Where|upon they both ro&s;e up and went towards the hou&s;e. They were no &s;ooner gone, but <HI>Euphranor</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Crito</HI> &s;aid, he believed that poor Gentle|man had been a great &s;ufferer for his Free-thinking, for that he &s;eemed to expre&s;s him&s;elf with the pa&s;&s;ion and Re&s;entment natural to Men who have received very bad u&s;age. I believe no &s;uch thing, an&s;wered <HI>Crito,</HI> but have often ob&s;erved tho&s;e of his Sect run into two faults of conver&s;ation, declaiming and ban|tering, ju&s;t as the tragic or the comic humour pre|vails. Sometimes they work them&s;elves into high pa&s;&s;ions and are frightened at Spectres of their own rai&s;ing. In tho&s;e fits every Country Curate pa&s;&s;es
<PB N="10" REF="19">
for an Inqui&s;itor. At other times they affect a &s;ly fa|cetious manner, making u&s;e of hints and allu&s;ions, ex|pre&s;&s;ing little, in&s;inuating much, and upon the whole &s;eeming to divert them&s;elves with the Subject and their Adver&s;aries. But if you wou'd know their opi|nions you mu&s;t make them &s;peak out and keep clo&s;e to the point. Per&s;ecution for Free-thinking is a topic they are apt to enlarge on though without any ju&s;t cau&s;e, every one being at full liberty to think what he plea&s;es, there being no &s;uch thing in <HI>England</HI> that I know as Per&s;ecution for opinion, &s;entiment, or thought. But in every Country, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome care is taken to re&s;train petulant Speech, and, what|ever Mens inward thoughts may be, to di&s;courage an outward contempt of what the public e&s;teemeth Sa|cred. Whether this care in <HI>England</HI> hath of late been &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, as to di&s;tre&s;s the Subjects of this once free and ea&s;y Government, whether the Free-thinkers can truly complain of any hard&s;hip upon the &s;core of con&s;cience or opinion, you will better be able to judge, when you hear from them&s;elves an account of the numbers, progre&s;s and notions of their Sect: which I doubt not they will communicate fully and freely, provided no body pre&s;ent &s;eem &s;hocked or of|fended. For in that ca&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible good manners may put them upon &s;ome re&s;erve. Oh! &s;aid <HI>Euphra|nor,</HI> I am never angry with any Man for his opinion whether he be <HI>Jew, Turk</HI> or <HI>Idolater,</HI> he may &s;peak his mind freely to me without fear of offending. I &s;hou'd even be glad to hear what he hath to &s;ay, pro|vided he &s;aith it in an ingenuous candid manner.

&s;tood over-again&s;t us, with his arms folded a|cro&s;s, and his head reclined on the left &s;houlder in the po&s;ture of a Man meditating. We &s;ate &s;ilent not to di&s;turb his thoughts; and after two or three Minutes he uttered the&s;e words, oh Truth! oh Liberty! after which he remained mu&s;ing as before. Upon this <HI>Eu|phranor</HI> took the freedom to interrupt him. <HI>Alciphron,</HI> &s;aid he, it is not fair to &s;pend your time in Soliloquies. The conver&s;ation of learned and knowing Men is rarely to be met with in this corner, and the opportunity you have put into my Hands I value too much, not to make the be&s;t u&s;e of it. <HI>ALC.</HI> Are you then in ear|ne&s;t a Votary of Truth, and is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hou'd bear the liberty of a fair Inquiry? <HI>EUPH.</HI> It is what I de&s;ire of all things. <HI>ALC.</HI> What! upon every Subject? upon the notions you fir&s;t &s;ucked in with your Milk, and which have been ever &s;ince nur|&s;ed by parents, pa&s;tors, tutors, religious a&s;&s;emblies, books of Devotion and &s;uch methods of pre-po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing Mens minds. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I love information up|on all Subjects that come in my way, and e&s;pecially upon tho&s;e that are mo&s;t important. <HI>ALC.</HI> If then you are in earne&s;t hold fair and &s;tand firm, while I probe your prejudices and extirpate your principles.</P>
<Q>Dum veteres avias tibi de pulmone revello.</Q>
<P>Having &s;aid thus, <HI>Alciphron</HI> knit his brows and made a &s;hort pau&s;e, after which he proceeded in the fol|lowing manner. If we are at the pains to dive and penetrate into the bottom of things, and analy&s;e Opinions into their fir&s;t principles, we &s;hall find that tho&s;e Opinions which are thought of greate&s;t con&s;e|quence have the &s;lighte&s;t original, being derived either from the ca&s;ual cu&s;toms of the Country where we live, or from early in&s;truction in&s;tilled into our tender minds, before we are able to di&s;cern between right and wrong, true and fal&s;e. The Vulgar (by whom I under&s;tand all tho&s;e who do not make a free
<PB N="12" REF="21">
u&s;e of their Rea&s;on) are apt to take the&s;e prejudices for things &s;acred and unque&s;tionable, believing them to be imprinted on the hearts of men by God him&s;elf, or convey'd by Revelation from Heaven, or to carry with them &s;o great light and evidence as mu&s;t force an a&s;&s;ent without any inquiry or examination. Thus the &s;hallow Vulgar have their heads furni&s;hed with &s;un|dry conceits, principles and doctrines, religious, mo|ral and political, all which they maintain with a zeal proportionable to their want of Rea&s;on. On the other hand, tho&s;e who duly employ their faculties in the &s;earch of Truth, take e&s;pecial care to weed out of their minds and extirpate all &s;uch notions or pre|judices as were planted in them before they arrived at the free and intire u&s;e of Rea&s;on. This difficult task hath been &s;ucce&s;sfully performed by our modern Free-thinkers, who have not only di&s;&s;ected with great Sagacity the received Sy&s;tems, and traced every e&s;ta|bli&s;hed prejudice to the fountain-head, the true and genuine motives of a&s;&s;ent: But al&s;o, having been able to embrace in one comprehen&s;ive view the &s;everal parts and ages of the World, they ob&s;erved a wonder|ful variety of Cu&s;toms and Rites, of In&s;titutions Re|ligious and Civil, of Notions and Opinions very un|like and even contrary one to another: A certain &s;ign they cannot all be true. And yet they are all main|tained by their &s;everal Parti&s;ans with the &s;ame po&s;itive air and warm zeal, and if examined will be found to bottom on one and the &s;ame Foundation, the &s;trength of prejudice. By the help of the&s;e Remarks and Di&s;coveries, they have broke through the bands of popular Cu&s;tom, and having freed them&s;elves from Impo&s;ture do now generou&s;ly lend a hand to their Fellow Subjects, to lead them into the &s;ame paths of Light and Liberty. Thus, Gentlemen, I have given you a &s;ummary account of the views and endeavours of tho&s;e Men who are called Free-thinkers. If in the cour&s;e of what I have &s;aid or &s;hall &s;ay hereafter, there be &s;ome things contrary to your pre-conceived Opi|nions,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
and therefore &s;hocking and di&s;agreeable, you will pardon the freedom and plainne&s;s of a Philo&s;o|pher, and con&s;ider that, whatever di&s;plea&s;ure I give you of that kind, I do it in &s;trict regard to Truth and Obedience to your own commands. I am very &s;en&s;ible, that Eyes long kept in the dark cannot bear a &s;udden view of noon day light, but mu&s;t be brought to it by degrees. It is for this Rea&s;on, the ingenious Gentlemen of our Profe&s;&s;ion are accu&s;tomed to pro|ceed gradually, beginning with tho&s;e prejudices to which Men have the lea&s;t Attachment, and thence proceeding to undermine the re&s;t by &s;low and in&s;en&s;i|ble degrees, till they have demoli&s;hed the whole Fa|bric of Human Folly and Super&s;tition. But the little time I can propo&s;e to &s;pend here obligeth me to take a &s;horter cour&s;e, and be more direct and plain than po&s;&s;ibly may be thought to &s;uit with Prudence and good Manners. Upon this, we a&s;&s;ured him he was at full liberty to &s;peak his mind of Things, Per&s;ons and Opinions without the lea&s;t re&s;erve. It is a liberty, re|plied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> that we Free-thinkers are equally wil|ling to give and take. We love to call things by their right Names, and cannot endure that Truth &s;hou'd &s;uffer through Complai&s;ance. Let us therefore lay it down for a Preliminary, that no offence be taken at any thing what&s;oever &s;hall be &s;aid on either &s;ide. To which we all agreed.</P>

<P>In order then, &s;aid <HI>Alciphron,</HI> to find out the Truth, we will &s;uppo&s;e that I am bred up, for in|&s;tance in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> When I come to maturity of Judgment and reflect on the particular Wor&s;hip and Opinions of this Church, I do not re|member when or by what means they fir&s;t took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind, but there I find them from time immemorial. Then ca&s;ting an Eye on the Educati|on of Children, from whence I can make a judgment of my own, I ob&s;erve they are in&s;tructed in religious matters before they can rea&s;on about them, and con|&s;equently
<PB N="14" REF="23">
that all &s;uch in&s;truction is nothing el&s;e but filling the tender mind of a Child with prejudices. I do therefore reject all tho&s;e religious notions, which I con&s;ider as the other Follies of my Childhood. I am confirmed in this way of thinking, when I look a|broad into the World, where I ob&s;erve Papi&s;ts and &s;e|veral Sects of Di&s;&s;enters which do all agree in a gene|ral profe&s;&s;ion of Belief in Chri&s;t, but differ va&s;tly one from another in the particulars of Faith and Wor|&s;hip. I then enlarge my View &s;o as to take in <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> between whom and the Chri&s;tians I perceive indeed &s;ome &s;mall agreement in the Belief of one God; but then they have each their di&s;tinct Laws and Revelations, for which they expre&s;s the &s;ame regard. But extending my view &s;till further to Heatheni&s;h and Idolatrous Nations I di&s;cover an end|le&s;s variety, not only in particular Opinions and Modes of Wor&s;hip, but even in the very notion of a Deity, wherein they widely differ one from another, and from all the forementioned Sects. Upon the whole, in&s;tead of Truth &s;imple and uniform I perceive no|thing but Di&s;cord, Oppo&s;ition and wild Preten&s;ions, all &s;pringing from the &s;ame &s;ource to wit the prejudice of Education. From &s;uch rea&s;onings and reflections as the&s;e, thinking Men have concluded that all Reli|gions are alike fal&s;e and fabulous. One is a Chri&s;tian, another a Jew, a third a Mahometan, a fourth an Ido|latrous Gentile, but all from one and the &s;ame rea&s;on, becau&s;e they happen to be bred up each in his re&s;pec|tive Sect. In the &s;ame manner, therefore, as each of the&s;e contending Parties condemns the re&s;t, &s;o an un|prejudiced &s;tander-by will condemn and reject them all together, ob&s;erving that they all draw their origin from the &s;ame fallacious Principle, and are carried on by the &s;ame Artifice to an&s;wer the &s;ame ends of the Prie&s;t and the Magi&s;trate.</P>

<HI>ALC.</HI> I do, and &s;o mu&s;t every one who con|&s;iders things in a true light. For you mu&s;t know, the Magi&s;trates principal aim is to keep the People under him in awe. Now the public Eye re&s;trains Men from open Offences again&s;t the Laws and Govern|ment. But to prevent &s;ecret Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions a Magi|&s;trate finds it expedient, that Men &s;hou'd believe there is an Eye of Providence watching over their private Actions and De&s;igns. And, to intimidate tho&s;e who might otherwi&s;e be drawn into Crimes by the pro&s;|pect of Plea&s;ure and Profit, he gives them to under|&s;tand, that whoever e&s;capes Puni&s;hment in this Life will be &s;ure to find it in the next, and that &s;o heavy and la&s;ting as infinitely to over-balance the Plea&s;ure and Profit accruing from his Crimes. Hence the Be|lief of a God, the Immortality of the Soul, and a future &s;tate of Rewards and Puni&s;hments have been e&s;teemed u&s;eful Engines of Government. And to the end that the&s;e notional airy Doctrines might make a &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion, and be retained on the minds of Men, skilful Rulers have in the &s;everal civilized Na|tions of the Earth devi&s;ed Temples, Sacrifices, Churches, Rites, Ceremonies, Habits, Mu&s;ic, Prayer, Preaching, and the like &s;piritual trumpery, whereby the Prie&s;t maketh temporal gains, and the Magi&s;trate findeth his account in frightening and &s;ub|duing the People. This is the original of the Combi|nation between Church and State, of Religion by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, of rights, immunities and incomes of Prie&s;ts all over the World: There being no Go|vernment but wou'd have you fear God that you may honour the King or civil Power. And you will ever ob&s;erve that politic Princes keep up a good under|&s;tanding with their Clergy, to the end that they in re|turn, by inculcating Religion and Loyalty into the minds of the People, may render them tame, timorous and &s;lavi&s;h. <HI>Crito</HI> and I heard this Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Alci|phron</HI> with the utmo&s;t attention, though without any appearance of &s;urprize, there being indeed nothing

In the next place, having ob&s;erved &s;everal Sects and Subdivi&s;ions of Sects e&s;pou&s;ing very different and contrary Opinions, and yet all profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, I rejected tho&s;e Points wherein they diffe|red, retaining only that which was agreed to by all, and &s;o became a <HI>Latitudinarian.</HI> Having afterwards, up|on a more enlarged View of things, perceived that Chri&s;tians, Jews, and Mahometans had each their dif|ferent Sy&s;tems of Faith, agreeing only in the Belief of one God, I became a <HI>Dei&s;t.</HI> La&s;tly, extending my View to all the other various Nations which inhabit this Globe, and finding they agreed in no one Point of Faith, but differed one from another, as well as from the forementioned Sects, even in the Notion of a God, in which there is as great Diver&s;ity as in the Methods of Wor&s;hip, I thereupon became an <HI>Athei&s;t:</HI> it being my Opinion that a Man of Courage and Sen&s;e &s;hou'd follow his Argument wherever it leads him, and that nothing is more ridiculous than to be a Free-thinker by halves.

<P>Athei&s;m therefore, that Bugbear of Women and Fools, is the very Top and Perfection of Free-thinking. It is the grand <HI>Arcanum</HI> to which a true Genius naturally ri&s;eth, by a certain Climax or Gra|dation of Thought, and without which he can never po&s;&s;e&s;s his Soul in ab&s;olute Liberty and Repo&s;e. For your thorough Conviction in this main Article, do but examine the Notion of a God with the &s;ame Freedom that you would other Prejudices. Trace it to the fountain-head, and you &s;hall not find that you had it by any of your Sen&s;es, the only true means of di&s;|covering what is real and &s;ub&s;tantial in Nature: You will find it lying among&s;t other old Lumber in &s;ome ob&s;cure corner of the Imagination, the proper Re|ceptacle of Vi&s;ions, Fancies, and Prejudices of all
<PB N="18" REF="27">
kinds; and if you are more attached to this than the re&s;t, it is only becau&s;e it is the olde&s;t. This is all, take my Word for it, and not mine only, but that of many more the mo&s;t ingenious Men of the Age, who, I can a&s;&s;ure you, think as I do on the Subject of a Deity. Though &s;ome of them hold it proper, to proceed with more Re&s;erve in declaring to the World their Opinion in this Particular, than in mo&s;t others. And it mu&s;t be owned, there are &s;till too many in <HI>Eng|land</HI> who retain a fooli&s;h Prejudice again&s;t the Name of Athei&s;t. But it le&s;&s;ens every Day among the bet|ter &s;ort: and when it is quite worn out, our Free-thinkers may then, (and not till then) be &s;aid to have given the fini&s;hing Stroke to Religion; it being evi|dent that &s;o long as the Exi&s;tence of God is believed, Religion mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ome Shape or other. But the Root being once plucked up, the Scions which &s;hot from it will of cour&s;e wither and decay. Such are all tho&s;e whim&s;ical Notions of Con&s;cience, Duty, Principle, and the like, which fill a Man's Head with Scruples, awe him with Fears, and make him a more thorough Slave than the Hor&s;e he rides. A Man had better a thou&s;and times be hunted by Bailiffs or Me&s;|&s;engers than haunted by the&s;e Spectres, which emba|ra&s;s and embitter all his Plea&s;ures, creating the mo&s;t real and &s;ore Servitude upon Earth. But the Free-thinker, with a vigorous flight of Thought breaks through tho&s;e airy Springes, and a&s;&s;erts his original Independency. Others indeed may talk, and write, and fight about Liberty, and make an outward Pre|tence to it, but the Free-thinker alone is truly free. <HI>Alciphron</HI> having ended this Di&s;cour&s;e with an Air of Triumph, <HI>Euphranor</HI> &s;poke to him in the following Manner. You make clear Work. The Gentlemen of your Profe&s;&s;ion are, it &s;eems, admirable Weeders. You have rooted up a world of Notions, I &s;hou'd be glad to &s;ee what fine things you have planted in their &s;tead. <HI>ALC.</HI> Have Patience, good <HI>Euphranor.</HI> I will &s;hew you in the fir&s;t place, That whatever was
<PB N="19" REF="28">
&s;ound and good we leave untouched, and encourage it to grow in the Mind of Man. And &s;econdly, I will &s;hew you what excellent things we have planted in it. You mu&s;t know then, that pur&s;uing our clo&s;e and &s;evere Scrutiny, we do at la&s;t arrive at &s;omething &s;olid and real, in which all Mankind agree, to wit, the Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Sen&s;es: The&s;e are found|ed in Nature, are real, have real Objects, and are at|tended with real and &s;ub&s;tantial Plea&s;ures; Food, Drink, Sleep, and the like animal Enjoyments be|ing what all Men like and love. And if we extend our view to the other kinds of Animals, we &s;hall find them all agree in this, that they have certain na|tural Appetites and Sen&s;es, in the gratifying and &s;ati&s;|fying of which they are con&s;tantly employ'd. Now the&s;e real natural good things which include nothing of Notion or Fancy, we are &s;o far from de&s;troying, that we do all we can to cheri&s;h and improve them. According to us, every wi&s;e Man looks upon him|&s;elf, or his own bodily Exi&s;tence in this pre&s;ent World, as the Center and ultimate End of all his Ac|tions and Regards. He con&s;iders his Appetites as na|tural Guides directing to his proper Good, his Pa&s;&s;i|ons and Sen&s;es as the natural true Means of enjoying this Good. Hence he endeavours to keep his Appe|tites in high Reli&s;h, his Pa&s;&s;ions and Sen&s;es &s;trong and lively, and to provide the greate&s;t Quantity and Va|riety of real Objects &s;uited to them, which he &s;tudi|eth to enjoy by all po&s;&s;ible means, and in the highe&s;t Perfection imaginable. And the Man who can do this without Re&s;traint, Remor&s;e, or Fear, is as hap|py as any other Animal what&s;oever, or as his Nature is capable of being. Thus I have given you a &s;uc|cinct View of the Principles, Di&s;coveries, and Te|nets of the &s;elect Spirits of this enlightned Age.</P>

into the Tenets of his Sect. But, if I may be allow|ed to &s;peak my Mind, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> though in compli|ance with my own Reque&s;t, hath given me no &s;mall Unea&s;ine&s;s. You need, &s;aid <HI>Alciphron,</HI> make no A|pology for &s;peaking freely what you think to one who profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf a Free-thinker. I &s;hou'd be &s;orry to make one, whom I meant to oblige, unea&s;y. Pray let me know wherein I have offended. I am half a|&s;hamed, replied <HI>Euphranor,</HI> to own that I who am no great Genius have a Weakne&s;s incidental to little ones. I wou'd &s;ay that I have favourite Opinions, which you repre&s;ent to be Errors and Prejudices. For In|&s;tance, the Immortality of the Soul is a Notion I am fond of, as what &s;upports the Mind with a very plea|&s;ing Pro&s;pect. And if it be an Error, I &s;hou'd per|haps be of <HI>Tully</HI>'s Mind, who in that Ca&s;e profe&s;&s;ed he &s;hou'd be &s;orry to know the Truth, acknowledg|ing no &s;ort of Obligation to certain Philo&s;ophers in his Days, who taught the Soul of Man was mortal. They were, it &s;eems, Predece&s;&s;ors to tho&s;e who are now called Free-thinkers; which Name being too general and indefinite, ina&s;much as it comprehends all tho&s;e who think for them&s;elves, whether they agree in Opinon with the&s;e Gentlemen or no, it &s;hou'd not &s;eem ami&s;s to a&s;&s;ign them a &s;pecific Appellation or peculiar Name, whereby to di&s;tingui&s;h them from other Philo&s;ophers, at lea&s;t in our pre&s;ent Conference. For I cannot bear to argue again&s;t Free-thinking and Free-thinkers. <HI>ALC.</HI> In the Eyes of a wi&s;e Man Words are of &s;mall moment. We do not think Truth attached to a Name. <HI>EUPH.</HI> If you plea&s;e then, to avoid Confu&s;ion, let us call your Sect by the &s;ame Name that <HI>Tully</HI> (who under&s;tood the force of Lan|guage) be&s;tow'd upon them. <HI>ALC.</HI> With all my heart. Pray what may that Name be? <HI>EUPH.</HI> Why, he calls them <HI>Minute Philo&s;ophers.</HI> Right, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> the modern Free-thinkers are the very &s;ame with tho&s;e <HI>Cicero</HI> called Minute Philo&s;ophers, which Name admirably &s;uits them, they being a &s;ort
<PB N="21" REF="30">
of Sect which dimini&s;h all the mo&s;t valuable things, the thoughts, views, and hopes of Men; all the Knowledge, Notions, and Theories of the Mind they reduce to Sen&s;e; Humane Nature they contract and degrade to the narrow low Standard of Animal Life, and a&s;&s;ign us only a &s;mall pittance of Time in|&s;tead of Immortality. <HI>Alciphron</HI> very gravely re|mark'd, That the Gentlemen of his Sect had done no injury to Man, and that if he be a little, &s;hort-lived, contemptible Animal, it was not their &s;aying it made him &s;o: And they were no more to blame for what|ever defects they di&s;cover, than a faithful Gla&s;s for making the wrinkles which it only &s;hews. As to what you ob&s;erve, &s;aid he, of tho&s;e we now call Free-thinkers having been anciently termed <HI>Minute Philo|&s;ophers,</HI> it is my opinion this Appellation might be derived from their con&s;idering things minutely, and not &s;wallowing them in the gro&s;s, as other Men are u&s;ed to do. Be&s;ides, we all know the be&s;t Eyes are nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cern the minute&s;t Objects: It &s;eems therefore, that Minute Philo&s;ophers might have been &s;o called from their di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;picacity. <HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Alciphron!</HI> the&s;e Minute Philo&s;ophers (&s;ince that is their true Name) are a &s;ort of Pirates who plunder all that come in their way.

<P>But who are the&s;e profound and learned Men that of late Years have demoli&s;hed the whole Fabric which Law-givers, Philo&s;ophers and Divines had been erecting for &s;o many Ages? <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> hearing the&s;e words, &s;miled, and &s;aid he believed <HI>Euphranor</HI> had figured to him&s;elf Philo&s;ophers in &s;quare caps and long gowns: but, thanks to the&s;e happy Times, the Reign of Pedantry was over. Our Philo&s;ophers, &s;aid he, are of a very different kind from tho&s;e auk|ward Students, who think to come at Knowledge by poring on dead Languages, and old Authors, or
<PB N="22" REF="31">
by &s;eque&s;tring them&s;elves from the Cares of the World to meditate in Solitude and Retirement. They are the be&s;t bred Men of the Age, Men who know the World, Men of plea&s;ure, Men of fa&s;hion, and fine Gentlemen. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I have &s;ome &s;mall notion of the People you mention, but &s;hou'd never have taken them for Philo&s;ophers. <HI>CRI.</HI> Nor wou'd any one el&s;e till of late. The World it &s;eems was long under a mi&s;take about the way to Knowledge, think|ing it lay through a tedious cour&s;e of Academical E|ducation and Study. But among the Di&s;coveries of the pre&s;ent Age, one of the principal is the finding out that &s;uch a Method doth rather retard and ob|&s;truct, than promote Knowledge. <HI>ALC.</HI> Acade|mical Study may be compri&s;ed in two points, Read|ing and Meditation. Their Reading is chiefly em|ploy'd on ancient Authors in dead Languages: &s;o that a great part of their Time is &s;pent in learning Words; which, when they have ma&s;tered with infinite pains, what do they get by it but old and ob&s;elete Notions, that are now quite exploded and out of u&s;e? Then, as to their Meditations, what can they po&s;&s;ibly be good for? He that wants the proper Materials of Thought, may think and meditate for ever to no purpo&s;e: Tho&s;e Cobwebs &s;pun by Scholars out of their own Brains being alike un&s;erviceable, either for U&s;e or Ornament. Proper Ideas or Materials are on|ly to be got by frequenting good Company. I know &s;everal Gentlemen, who, &s;ince their Appearance in the World, have &s;pent as much time in rubbing off the ru&s;t and pedantry of a College Education, as they had done before in acquiring it. <HI>LYS.</HI> I'll un|dertake, a Lad of fourteen, bred in the modern way, &s;hall make a better Figure, and be more con&s;idered in any Drawing-Room or A&s;&s;embly of polite People, than one of four and twenty, who hath lain by a long time at School and College. He &s;hall &s;ay better things, in a better manner, and be more liked by good Judges. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Where doth he pick up all this Improve|ment?
<PB N="23" REF="32">
<HI>CRI.</HI> Where our grave Ance&s;tors wou'd ne|ver have look'd for it, in a Drawing-Room, a Coffee-Hou&s;e, a Chocolate-Hou&s;e, at the Tavern, or Groom-Porter's. In the&s;e and the like fa&s;hionable Places of Re&s;ort, it is the Cu&s;tom for polite Per&s;ons to &s;peak freely on all Subjects, religious, moral, or political. So that a young Gentleman who frequents them is in the way of hearing many in&s;tructive Lec|tures, &s;ea&s;oned with Wit and Raillery, and uttered with Spirit. Three or four Sentences from a Man of quality &s;poke with a good Air, make more Impre&s;&s;i|on, and convey more Knowledge, than a dozen Di&s;|&s;ertations in a dry Academical way. <HI>EUPH.</HI> There is then no Method or Cour&s;e of Studies in tho&s;e Places. <HI>LYS.</HI> None but an ea&s;y free Conver&s;ation, which takes in every thing that offers, without any Rule or De&s;ign. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I always thought that &s;ome Order was nece&s;&s;ary to attain any u&s;eful degree of Knowledge, that Ha&s;te and Confu&s;ion begat a conceited Ignorance, that to make our Advances &s;ure, they &s;hou'd be gradual, and tho&s;e Points fir&s;t learned which might ca&s;t a light on what was to follow. <HI>ALC.</HI> So long as Learning was to be obtained only by that &s;low formal cour&s;e of Study, few of the bet|ter &s;ort knew much of it; but now it is grown an Amu&s;ement, our young Gentry and Nobility imbibe it in&s;en&s;ibly amid&s;t their Diver&s;ions, and make a con|&s;iderable Progre&s;s. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Hence probably the great number of Minute Philo&s;ophers. <HI>CRI.</HI> It is to this that Sect is owing for &s;o many ingenious Pro|ficients of both Sexes. You may now commonly &s;ee (what no former Age ever &s;aw) a young Lady, or a <HI>Petit Maitre</HI> nonplus a Divine or an old-fa&s;hioned Gentleman, who hath read many a <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Author, and &s;pent much Time in hard methodical Study. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It &s;hou'd &s;eem then that Method, Exactne&s;s, and Indu&s;try are a Di&s;advantage. Here <HI>Alciphron,</HI> turning to <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> &s;aid he cou'd make the point very clear, if <HI>Euphranor</HI> had any notion of
<PB N="24" REF="33">
Painting. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I never &s;aw a fir&s;t-rate Picture in my Life, but have a tolerable Collection of Prints, and have &s;een &s;ome good Drawings. <HI>ALC.</HI> You know then the difference between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Italian</HI> manner. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I have &s;ome notion of it. <HI>ALC.</HI> Suppo&s;e now a Drawing fini&s;hed by the nice and laborious Touches of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pencil, and ano|ther off hand &s;cratched out in the free manner of a great <HI>Italian</HI> Ma&s;ter. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Piece, which hath co&s;t &s;o much pains and time will be exact indeed, but without that Force, Spirit, or Grace, which appear in the other, and are the Effects of an ea&s;y free Pen|cil. Do but apply this, and the Point will be clear. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Pray inform me, did tho&s;e great <HI>Italian</HI> Ma|&s;ters begin and proceed in their Art without any choice of Method or Subject, and always draw with the &s;ame ea&s;e and freedom? Or did they ob&s;erve &s;ome Method, beginning with &s;imple and elementary parts, an Eye, a No&s;e, a Finger, which they drew with great pains and care, often drawing the &s;ame thing, in order to draw it correctly, and &s;o proceeding with Patience and Indu&s;try, till after a con&s;iderable length of Time they arrived at the free ma&s;terly manner you &s;peak of. If this were the Ca&s;e, I leave you to make the Application. <HI>ALC.</HI> You may di&s;pute the Mat|ter if you plea&s;e. But a Man of parts is one thing, and a Pedant another. Pains and Method may do for &s;ome &s;ort of People. A Man mu&s;t be a long time kindling wet Straw into a vile &s;mothering Flame, but Spirits blaze out at once. <HI>EUPH.</HI> The Minute Philo&s;ophers have, it &s;eems, better Parts than other Men, which qualifies them for a different Education. <HI>ALC.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> what is it that gives one Man a better Mien than another; more Politene&s;s in Dre&s;s, Speech, and Motion? Nothing but frequen|ting good Company. By the &s;ame means Men get in&s;en&s;ibly a delicate Ta&s;te, a refined Judgment, a cer|tain Politene&s;s in thinking and expre&s;&s;ing one's &s;elf. No wonder if you Countrymen are &s;trangers to the
<PB N="25" REF="34">
Advantage of polite Conver&s;ation, which con&s;tant|ly keeps the Mind awake and active, exerci&s;ing its Faculties, and calling forth all its Strength and Spirit on a thou&s;and different Occa&s;ions and Subjects, that never came in the way of a Book-worm in a College, no more than of a Ploughman. <HI>CRI.</HI> Hence tho&s;e lively Faculties, that quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, that &s;lyne&s;s of Ridicule, that egregious Talent of Wit and Humour which di&s;tingui&s;h the Gentlemen of your Profe&s;&s;ion. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It &s;hou'd &s;eem then that your Sect is made up of what you call fine Gen|tlemen. <HI>LYS.</HI> Not altogether, for we have among us &s;ome contemplative Spirits of a coar&s;er Education, who, from ob&s;erving the Behaviour and Proceedings of Apprentices, Watermen, Porters, and the A&s;|&s;emblies of Rabble in the Streets, have arrived at a profound Knowledge of Humane Nature, and made great Di&s;coveries about the Principles, Springs, and Motives of moral Actions. The&s;e have demoli&s;hed the received Sy&s;tems, and done a world of good in the City. <HI>ALC.</HI> I tell you we have Men of all Sorts and Profe&s;&s;ions, plodding Citizens, thriving Stockjobbers, skilful Men in Bu&s;ine&s;s, polite Cour|tiers, gallant Men of the Army; but our chief Strength and Flower of the Flock are tho&s;e promi&s;ing young Men who have the Advantage of a modern Educati|on.

But I am a&s;&s;ured by &s;ome judicious Friends who have &s;een it, that it is as clear as Day-light, and will do a world of good, at one blow demoli&s;hing the whole Sy&s;tem of Religion. The&s;e di&s;coveries are publi&s;hed by our Philo&s;ophers, &s;ometimes in ju&s;t Volumes, but often in Phamphlets and loo&s;e Papers for their readier con|veyance through the Kingdom.

Fear God, and honour the King, are a pair of &s;lavi&s;h maxims, which had for a long time crampt Human Nature, and awed not on|ly weak minds but even Men of good Under&s;tanding, till their Eyes, as I ob&s;erved before, were opened by our Philo&s;ophers. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Methinks I can ea&s;ily comprehend that, when the fear of God is quite ex|tingui&s;hed, the mind mu&s;t be very ea&s;y with re&s;pect to other Duties, which become outward pretences and formalities, from the moment that they quit their hold upon the Con&s;cience, and Con&s;cience al|ways &s;uppo&s;eth the Being of a God. But I &s;till
<PB N="28" REF="39">
thought that <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> of all denominations (how widely &s;oever they differ as to &s;ome particular points) agreed in the Belief of a God, and of &s;o much at lea&s;t, as is called natural Religion. <HI>ALC.</HI> I have alrea|dy told you my own Opinion of tho&s;e matters, and what I know to be the Opinion of many more. <HI>CRI.</HI> Probably, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> by the title of <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> which is &s;ometimes given to Minute Philo&s;ophers, you have been mi&s;-led to imagine they believe and wor&s;hip a God according to the light of Nature: but by living among them, you may &s;oon be convinced of the con|trary. They have neither time nor place, nor form of Divine wor&s;hip; they offer neither Prayers nor Prai&s;es to God in public; and in their private prac|tice &s;hew a contempt or di&s;like even of the Duties of natural Religion. For in&s;tance, the &s;aying Grace before and after meals is a plain point of natural wor&s;hip, and was once univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, but in proportion as this Sect prevailed it hath been laid a&s;ide, not only by the Minute Philo&s;ophers them|&s;elves, who wou'd be infinitely a&s;hamed of &s;uch a weakne&s;s as to beg God's ble&s;&s;ing, or give God thanks for their daily Food; but al&s;o by others who are afraid of being thought Fools by the Minute Phi|lo&s;ophers. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible that Men, who really believe a God, &s;hou'd yet decline paying &s;o ea&s;y and rea&s;onable a Duty for fear of incurring the contempt of Athei&s;ts? <HI>CRI.</HI> I tell you there are many, who believing in their Hearts the truth of Re|ligion, are yet afraid or a&s;hamed to own it, le&s;t they &s;hou'd forfeit their Reputation with tho&s;e who have the good luck to pa&s;s for great wits and Men of genius. <HI>ALC.</HI> O <HI>Euphranor,</HI> we mu&s;t make allow|ance for <HI>Crito</HI>'s prejudice: he is a worthy Gentle|man and means well.

<P>The profound Thinkers of this way have taken a direct contrary cour&s;e to all the great Philo|&s;ophers of former ages, who made it their Endea|vour to rai&s;e and refine Humane Kind, and remove it as far as po&s;&s;ible from the Brute; to moderate and &s;ubdue Mens Appetites; to remind them of the dig|nity of their nature; to awaken and improve their &s;uperior Faculties and direct them to the noble&s;t Ob|jects; to po&s;&s;e&s;s Mens minds with a high Sen&s;e of the Divinity, of the &s;upreme Good, and the Immortali|ty of the Soul. They took great pains to &s;trengthen the Obligations to Virtue, and upon all tho&s;e Sub|jects have wrought out noble Theories, and treated with &s;ingular force of Rea&s;on. But it &s;eems our Minute Philo&s;ophers act the rever&s;e of all other wi&s;e and thinking Men; it being their end and aim to era&s;e the Principles of all that is great and good from the mind of Man, to unhinge all order of civil Life, to undermine the foundations of morality, and, in|&s;tead
<PB N="30" REF="41">
of improving and ennobling our natures, to bring us down to the maxims and way of thinking of the mo&s;t uneducated and barbarous nations, and even to degrade Humane Kind to a level with Brute Bea&s;ts. And all the while they wou'd pa&s;s upon the World for Men of deep Knowledge. But in effect what is all this negative Knowledge better than downright &s;a|vage Ignorance? That there is no Providence, no Spi|rit, no future State, no moral Duty: truly a fine Sy|&s;tem for an hone&s;t Man to own, or an ingenious Man to value him&s;elf upon! <HI>Alciphron</HI> who heard this di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s very gravely replied. Di&s;putes are not to be decided by the weight of Au|thority, but by the force of Rea&s;on. You may pa&s;s, indeed, general reflexions on our notions and call them brutal and barbarous if you plea&s;e: But it is &s;uch brutality and &s;uch barbari&s;m as few cou'd have attained to if Men of the greate&s;t Genius had not broke the Ice, there being nothing more difficult than to get the better of Education, and conquer old prejudices. To remove and ca&s;t off a heap of Rub|bi&s;h that has been gathering upon the Soul from our very infancy, requires great courage and great &s;trength of Faculties. Our Philo&s;ophers therefore, do well de&s;erve the name of <HI>E&s;prits forts, Men of &s;trong heads, Free-thinkers</HI> and &s;uch like Appellations betokening great force and liberty of mind. It is very po&s;&s;ible, the Heroic Labours of the&s;e Men may be repre&s;ented (for what is not capable of mi&s;repre|&s;entation?) as a piratical plundering and &s;tripping the mind of its wealth and ornaments, when it is in truth the dive&s;ting it only of its prejudices, and re|ducing it to its untainted original State of Nature.

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> For a thing to be natural, for in&s;tance to the mind of Man, it mu&s;t appear originally there|in, it mu&s;t be univer&s;ally in all Men, it mu&s;t be inva|riably the &s;ame in all Nations and Ages. The&s;e limi|tations of original, univer&s;al and invariable exclude all tho&s;e notions found in the Humane Mind, which are the effect of Cu&s;tom and Education. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to all other Species of Beings. A Cat, for example, hath a natural inclination to pur|&s;ue a Mou&s;e, becau&s;e it agrees with the forementioned marks. But if a Cat be taught to play tricks, you will not &s;ay tho&s;e tricks are natural. For the &s;ame rea&s;on if upon a Plumbtree, Peaches and Apricots are engrafted, no body will &s;ay they are the natural growth of the Plumbtree. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But to return to <HI>Man:</HI> It &s;eems you allow tho&s;e things alone to be natural to him, which &s;hew them&s;elves upon his fir&s;t entrance into the World; to wit the Sen&s;es and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites as are di&s;covered upon the fir&s;t applica|tion of their re&s;pective objects. <HI>ALC.</HI> That is my opinion. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> if from a young Apple-tree after a certain period of time there &s;hou'd &s;hoot forth Leaves, Blo&s;&s;oms and Apples; wou'd you deny the&s;e things to be natural, becau&s;e they did not di&s;cover and di&s;play them&s;elves in the tender bud? <HI>ALC.</HI> I wou'd not. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And &s;uppo&s;e that in a Man after a certain &s;ea&s;on, the Ap|petite of Lu&s;t or the Faculty of Rea&s;on &s;hall &s;hoot forth, open and di&s;play them&s;elves as Leaves and Blo&s;&s;oms do in a Tree; wou'd you therefore deny them to be natural to him, becau&s;e they did not ap|pear in his original infancy? <HI>ALC.</HI> I acknowledge I wou'd not. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It &s;eems therefore, that the fir&s;t mark of a thing's being natural to the mind was not warily laid down by you; to wit, that it &s;hou'd appear originally in it. <HI>ALC.</HI> It &s;eems &s;o. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Again, inform me, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> whether you do not think it natural for an Orange-plant to produce O|ranges? <HI>ALC.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But plant it in the

North end of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and it &s;hall with care pro|duce, perhaps, a good Sallad; in the Southern parts of the &s;ame I&s;land, it may with much pains and cul|ture thrive and produce indifferent Fruit; but in <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>Naples</HI> it will produce much better with little or no pains.

It cannot there|fore be a rea&s;onable end to be propo&s;ed by me in Truth and Nature, (for I do not &s;peak of political pretences) &s;ince no wi&s;e Man will pur&s;ue an end which doth not concern him. This is the voice of Nature. Oh Nature! thou art the fountain, original, and pattern of all that is good and wi&s;e. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You wou'd like then to follow Nature, and propo&s;e her as a guide and pattern for your imitation. <HI>ALC.</HI> Of all things. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Whence do you gather this re&s;pect for Na|ture? <HI>ALC.</HI> From the excellency of her Produc|tions. <HI>EUPH.</HI> In a Vegetable, for in&s;tance, you &s;ay there is u&s;e and excellency, becau&s;e the &s;everal parts of it are &s;o connected and fitted to each other, as to protect and nouri&s;h the whole, make the indi|vidual grow, and propagate the kind, and becau&s;e in its fruits or qualities it is adapted to plea&s;e the Sen&s;e, or contribute to the benefit of Man. <HI>ALC.</HI> Even &s;o. <HI>EUPH.</HI> In like manner, do you not infer the excellency of Animal Bodies from ob&s;erving the frame and fitne&s;s of their &s;everal parts, by which they mutually con&s;pire to the well-being of each o|ther
<PB N="39" REF="50">
as well as of the whole? Do you not al&s;o ob&s;erve a natural union and con&s;ent between Animals of the &s;ame kind, and that even different kinds of Animals have certain qualities and in&s;tincts whereby they con|tribute to the exerci&s;e, nouri&s;hment, and delight of each other? Even the inanimate unorganized Ele|ments &s;eem to have an excellence relative to each o|ther. Where was the excellency of Water if it did not cau&s;e Herbs and Vegetables to &s;pring from the Earth, and put forth flowers and fruits? And what wou'd become of the beauty of the Earth, if it was not warmed by the Sun, moi&s;tened by Water, and fanned by Air? Throughout the whole Sy&s;tem of the vi&s;ible and natural World, do you not perceive a mutual connexion and corre&s;pondence of parts? And is it not from hence that you frame an Idea of the perfection, and order, and beauty of Nature? <HI>ALC.</HI> All this I grant. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And have not the Stoics heretofore &s;aid (who were no more Bigots than you are) and did you not your &s;elf &s;ay, this pat|tern of Order was worthy the imitation of rational Agents? <HI>ALC.</HI> I do not deny this to be true. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Ought we not therefore to infer the &s;ame Union, Order, and Regularity in the moral World that we perceive to be in the natural? <HI>ALC.</HI> We ought. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Shou'd it not therefore &s;eem to follow that rea&s;onable Creatures were, as the philo&s;o|phical Emperor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

<PB N="42" REF="53">
half a mile off; where we walked on the &s;mooth &s;and, with the Ocean on one hand, and on the other wild broken Rocks, intermixed with &s;hady Trees and Springs of Water, till the Sun began to be unea&s;y. We then withdrew into a hollow Glade, between two Rocks, where we had no &s;ooner &s;eated our &s;elves but <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Euphranor,</HI> &s;aid: I am now ready to perform what I undertook la&s;t E|vening, which was to &s;hew, there is nothing in that nece&s;&s;ary Connection which &s;ome Men imagine be|tween tho&s;e Principles you contend for, and the pub|lic Good. I freely own, that if this Que&s;tion was to be decided by the authority of Legi&s;lators or Phi|lo&s;ophers, it mu&s;t go again&s;t us. For tho&s;e Men ge|nerally take it for granted, that Vice is pernicious to the Public; and that Men cannot be kept from Vice but by the fear of God, and the &s;en&s;e of a future State; whence they are induced to think the belief of &s;uch things nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of humane Kind. This fal&s;e notion hath prevailed for many ages in the World, and done an infinite deal of mi&s;chief, being in truth the cau&s;e of religious E&s;tabli&s;hments, and gaining the protection and encouragement of Laws and Magi&s;trates to the Clergy and their Super&s;titions. Even &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t among the Ancients, who agreed with our Sect in denying a Providence and the Immortality of the Soul, had neverthele&s;s the weak|ne&s;s to lie under the common prejudice that Vice was hurtful to Societies of Men. But <HI>England</HI> hath of late produced great Philo&s;ophers who have undecei|ved the world, and proved to a demon&s;tration that private Vices are public Benefits. This Di&s;covery was re&s;erved to our times, and our Sect hath the glory of it. <HI>CRI.</HI> It is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome Men of fine Under&s;tanding might in former ages have had a glimp&s;e of this important Truth; but it may be pre|&s;umed they lived in ignorant times and bigotted coun|tries, which were not ripe for &s;uch a di&s;covery. <HI>LYS.</HI> Men of narrow capacities and &s;hort &s;ight being able

to &s;ee no further than one link in a chain of Con&s;e|quences, are &s;hocked at &s;mall evils which attend up|on Vice.

To prove my point I &s;hall not trouble you with Authorities or far|fetched Arguments, but bring you to plain Matter of Fact. Do but take a view of each particular Vice, and trace it through its Effects and Con&s;equences, and then you will clearly perceive the advantage it brings to the Public.</P>

<P>Drunkenne&s;s, for in&s;tance, is by your &s;ober Morali&s;ts thought a pernicious Vice; but it is for want of con&s;idering the good effects that flow from it. For in the fir&s;t place it increa&s;es the Malt-Tax, a principal branch of his Maje&s;ty's Revenue, and thereby promotes the &s;afety, &s;trength, and glory of the Nation. Secondly, it employs a great number of hands, the Brewer, the Mal&s;ter, the Plough|man, the dealer in Hops, the Smith, the Carpenter, the Bra&s;ier, the Joiner, with all other artificers ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upply tho&s;e enumerated, with their re|&s;pective in&s;truments and uten&s;ils. All which advan|tages are procured from Drunkenne&s;s in the vulgar way, by &s;trong Beer. This point is &s;o clear it will admit of no di&s;pute. But while you are forced to al|low thus much, I fore&s;ee you are ready to object a|gain&s;t Drunkenne&s;s occa&s;ion'd by Wine and Spirits, as exporting wealth into foreign countries. But you do not reflect on the number of hands which even this &s;ets on work at home: The Di&s;tillers, the Vint|ners, the Merchants, the Sailors, the Shipwrights, with all tho&s;e who are employ'd towards victualling and fitting out Ships, which upon a nice computation will be found to include an incredible variety of Trades and Callings. Then for freighting our Ships to an&s;wer the&s;e foreign importations, all our manufactures
<PB N="44" REF="55">
throughout the Kingdom are employ'd, the Spinners, the Weavers, the Dyers, the Wool-combers, the the Carriers, the Packers. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of many other manufactures, as well as the wool|len. And if it be further con&s;idered, how many Men are enriched by all the forementioned ways of trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, and the expences of the&s;e Men, and their families, in all the &s;everal articles of conve|nient and fa&s;hionable living, whereby all &s;orts of trades and callings, not only at home, but through|out all parts wherever our commerce reaches, are kept in employment, you will be amazed at the wonderfully extended &s;cene of benefits which ari&s;e from the &s;ingle vice of Drunkenne&s;s, &s;o much run down and declaimed again&s;t by all grave Reformers. With as much judgment your half-witted folk are accu&s;tomed to cen&s;ure Gaming. And indeed (&s;uch is the ignorance and folly of Mankind) a Game&s;ter and a Drunkard are thought no better than public nu&s;ances, when in truth, they do each in their way greatly conduce to the public benefit. If you look only on the furface and fir&s;t appearance of things, you will no doubt think playing at Cards a very idle and fruitle&s;s occupation. But dive deeper, and you &s;hall perceive this idle amu&s;ement employs the Card-maker, and he &s;ets the Paper-mills at work, by which the poor Rag-man is &s;upported; not to mention the Builders and Workers in wood and iron that are em|ploy'd in erecting and furni&s;hing tho&s;e Mills. Look &s;till deeper, and you &s;hall find that Candles and Chair-hire employ the indu&s;trious and the poor, who by the&s;e means come to be relieved by Sharpers and Gen|tlemen, who wou'd not give one penny in charity. But you will &s;ay that many Gentlemen and Ladies are ruin|ed by play, without con&s;idering that what one Man lo&s;es another gets, and that con&s;equently as many are made as ruined; money changeth hands, and in this circulation the life of bu&s;ine&s;s and commerce con&s;i&s;ts. When money is &s;pent, it is all one to the Public who
<PB N="45" REF="56">
&s;pends it. Suppo&s;e a fool of quality becomes the dupe of a Man of mean birth and circum&s;tance, who has more wit. In this ca&s;e what harm doth the Public &s;u&s;tain? Poverty is relieved, Ingenuity is rewarded, the Money &s;tays at home, and has a lively circulation, the ingenious Sharper being enabled to &s;et up an equi-page and &s;pend hand&s;omely, which cannot be done without employing a world of people. But you will perhaps object, that a Man reduced by play may be put upon de&s;perate cour&s;es hurtful to the Public. Sup|po&s;e the wor&s;t, and that he turns Highwayman, &s;uch Men have a &s;hort life and a merry. While he lives, he &s;pends, and for one that he robs makes twenty the better for his expence. And when his time is come, a poor Family may be relieved by fifty or a hundred Pounds &s;et upon his Head. A vulgar eye looks on many a Man as an idle or mi&s;chievous fellow, whom a true Philo&s;opher viewing in another light, con&s;i|ders as a Man of plea&s;ant occupation who diverts him&s;elf, and benefits the Public: And that with &s;o much ea&s;e, that he employs a multitude of Men, and &s;ets an infinite Machine in motion, without knowing the good he does, or even intending to do any; which is peculiar to that Gentleman-like way of doing good by Vice. I was con&s;idering Play, and that in|&s;en&s;ibly led me to the advantages, which attend rob|bing on the high-way. Oh the beautiful and never e|nough admired connection of Vices! It wou'd take too much time to &s;hew how they all hang together, and what an infinite deal of good takes its ri&s;e from every one of them. One word for a favourite Vice, and I &s;hall leave you to make out the re&s;t your &s;elf, by applying the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning to all other vices. A poor Girl, who might not have the &s;pend|ing of half a Crown a week in what you call an ho|ne&s;t way, no &s;ooner hath the good fortune to be a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s, but &s;he employs Milliners, Laundre&s;&s;es, Tire-women, Mercers, and a number of other trades to the benefit of her Country. It wou'd be endle&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="57">
to trace and pur&s;ue every particular Vice through its con&s;equences and effects, and &s;hew the va&s;t advan|tage they all are of to the Public. The true Springs that actuate the great Machine of Commerce, and make a flouri&s;hing State have been hitherto little un|der&s;tood. Your Morali&s;ts and Divines have for &s;o many ages been corrupting the genuine Sen&s;e of man|kind, and filling their heads with &s;uch ab&s;urd princi|ples, that it is in the power of few Men to contem|plate real life with an unprejudiced Eye. And fewer &s;till have &s;ufficient Parts and Sagacity to pur&s;ue a long train of con&s;equences, relations and dependences, which mu&s;t be done in order to form a ju&s;t and entire notion of the public weal. But, as I &s;aid before, our Sect hath produced Men capable of the&s;e di&s;coveries, who have di&s;played them in a full light, and made them public for the benefit of their Country.</P>

an affair, a Gentleman to be a gallant, a Rogue in bu&s;i|ne&s;s to be one that knows the World.

<P><HI>CRI.</HI> I can illu&s;trate this Doctrine of <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> by examples that will make you perceive its force. <HI>Cleophon,</HI> a Minute Philo&s;opher, took &s;trict care of his Son's Education and entered him betimes in the prin|ciples of his Sect. <HI>Callicles</HI> (that was his Son's name) being a Youth of parts made a notable progre&s;s; in|&s;omuch that before he became of age he killed his old covetous Father with vexation, and ruined the E&s;tate he left behind him; or, in other words, made a pre|&s;ent of it to the Public, &s;preading the Dung-hill col|lected by his Ance&s;tors over the face of the Nation, and making out of the overgrown E&s;tate &s;everal pretty fortunes for ingenious Men, who live by the
<PB N="48" REF="59">
vices of the Great. <HI>Tele&s;illa,</HI> though a Woman of Quality and Spirit, made no figure in the World, till &s;he was in&s;tructed by her Husband in the tenets of the Minute Philo&s;ophy, which he wi&s;ely thought wou'd prevent her giving any thing in Charity. From that time &s;he took a turn towards expen&s;ive Diver&s;ions, particularly deep Play, by which means &s;he &s;oon transferred a con&s;iderable &s;hare of his fortune to &s;eve|ral acute Men skilled in that My&s;tery, who wanted it more, and circulate it quicker than her Husband wou'd have done, who in return hath got an Heir to his E&s;tate, having never had a Child before. That &s;ame <HI>Tele&s;illa,</HI> who was good for nothing as long as &s;he believed her Catechi&s;m, now &s;hines in all public places, is a Lady of gallantry and fa&s;hion, and has by her extravagant parade in Lace and fine Clothes rai&s;ed a Spirit of expence in other Ladies, very much to the public benefit, though it mu&s;t be owned to the mortification of many frugal Husbands. While <HI>Cri|to</HI> related the&s;e facts with a grave face, I cou'd not forbear &s;miling, which <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> ob&s;erving, &s;uperfici|al minds, &s;aid he, may perhaps find &s;omething to ri|dicule in the&s;e accounts; but all who are Ma&s;ters of a ju&s;t way of thinking mu&s;t needs &s;ee that tho&s;e max|ims, the benefit whereof is univer&s;al, and the damage only particular to private Per&s;ons or Families, ought to be encouraged in a wi&s;e Commonwealth. For my part, &s;aid <HI>Euphranor,</HI> I confe&s;s my &s;elf to be rather dazzled and confounded than convinced by your rea|&s;oning; which, as you ob&s;erved you &s;elf, taking in the connection of many di&s;tant points requires great extent of thought to comprehend it.

Upon the whole then compute and &s;ay, which is mo&s;t likely to promote the indu&s;try of his Country|men, a virtuous married Man with a healthy nume|rous Offspring, and who feeds and cloaths the Or|phans in his Neighbourhood, or a fa&s;hionable Rake about Town. I wou'd fain know whether Money &s;pent innocently, doth not circulate as well as that &s;pent upon Vice. And if &s;o, whether by your own rule it doth not benefit the Publick as much? <HI>LYS.</HI> What I have proved, I proved plainly, and there is no need of more words about it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You &s;eem to me, to have proved nothing, unle&s;s you can make it out that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;pend a fortune innocently. I &s;hou'd think the publick weal of a Nation con&s;i&s;ts in the number and good condition of its Inhabitants; have you any thing to object to this? <HI>LYS.</HI> I think not. <HI>EUPH.</HI> To this end which would mo&s;t conduce, the employing Men in open air and manly exerci&s;e, or in &s;edentary bu&s;ine&s;s within doors? <HI>LYS.</HI> The former I &s;uppo&s;e. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Shou'd it not &s;eem therefore, that building, gardening, and agriculture would employ Men more u&s;efully to the Public, than if Tailors, Barbers, Per|fumers, Di&s;tillers and &s;uch arts were multiplied. <HI>LYS.</HI> All this I grant; but it makes again&s;t you. For what moves Men to build and plant but vanity, and what is vanity but vice? <HI>EUPH.</HI> But if a Man &s;hou'd do tho&s;e things for his convenience or plea&s;ure, and in proportion to his fortune, without a fooli&s;h o&s;tenta|tion or over-rating them beyond their due value, they would not then be the effect of vice; and how do you know but this may be the ca&s;e? <HI>CRI.</HI> One thing

I know that the readie&s;t way to quicken that &s;ort of indu&s;try, and employ Carpenters, Ma&s;ons, Smiths, and all &s;uch trades wou'd be to put in practice the hap|py hint of a celebrated Minute Philo&s;opher, who by profound thinking has di&s;covered, that burning the City of <HI>London</HI> wou'd be no &s;uch bad action, as &s;illy prejudiced People might po&s;&s;ibly imagine; ina&s;much as it wou'd produce a quick circulation of property, transferring it from the rich to the poor, and employ|ing a great number of Artificers of all kinds.

Vice be not the likelie&s;t way to ruin and en&s;lave a Peo|ple. <HI>LYS.</HI> When a point is clear by its own evi|dence, I never think it worth while to con&s;ult old Authors about it. <HI>CRI.</HI> It requires much thought and delicate ob&s;ervation to go to the bottom of things. But one who hath come at Truth with diffi|culty can impart it with ea&s;e. I will therefore, <HI>Eu|phranor,</HI> explain to you in three words (what none of your old Writers ever dreamt of) the true cau&s;e of ruin to tho&s;e States. You mu&s;t know that Vice and Vir|tue, being oppo&s;ite and contradictory Principles, both working at once in a &s;tate, will produce contra|ry effects, which inte&s;tine di&s;cord mu&s;t needs tend to the di&s;&s;olution and ruin of the whole. But it is the de&s;ign of our Minute Philo&s;ophers, by making Men wicked upon principle, a thing unknown to the An|cients, &s;o to weaken and de&s;troy the force of virtue, that its effects &s;hall not be felt in the Public. In which ca&s;e Vice being uncontrolled without let or impedi|ment of principle, pure and genuine without allay of virtue, the Nation mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be very flouri&s;hing and triumphant. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Truly, a noble Scheme! <HI>CRI.</HI> And in a fair way to take effect. For our young proficients in the Minute Philo&s;ophy, having, by a rare felicity of Education, no tincture of bigo|try or prejudice, do far outgo the old &s;tanders and profe&s;&s;ors of the Sect; who, though Men of admi|rable parts, yet, having had the misfortune to be im|bued in their Childhood with &s;ome religious Noti|ons, cou'd never after get intirely rid of them; but &s;till retain &s;ome &s;mall grains of con&s;cience and &s;uper|&s;tition, which are a check upon the noble&s;t Genius. In proof of this, I remember that the famous Minute Philo&s;opher old <HI>Demodicus</HI> came one day, from con|ver&s;ation upon bu&s;ine&s;s with <HI>Timander,</HI> a young Gen|tleman of the &s;ame Sect, full of a&s;toni&s;hment.

<P><HI>EUPH.</HI> Though much may be hoped from the unprejudiced education of young Gentle|men, yet it &s;eems we are not to expect a &s;ettled and intire Happine&s;s, before Vice reigns pure and unmix|ed: till then, much is to be feared from the dange|rous &s;truggle between Vice and Virtue, which may perchance overturn and di&s;&s;olve this Government, as it hath done others. <HI>LYS.</HI> No matter for that, if a better comes in its place. We have cleared the land of all Prejudices towards Government or Con&s;tituti|on, and made them fly like other Phanta&s;ms before the light of Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e. Men who think deeply cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on, why Power &s;hou'd not change hands as well as Property; or why the fa&s;hi|on of a Government &s;hou'd not be changed as ea&s;y as that of a Garment. The perpetual circulating and revolving of Wealth and Power, no matter through what or who&s;e hands, is that which keeps up Life and Spirit in a State. Tho&s;e who are even &s;lightly read in our Philo&s;ophy, know that of all Prejudices the &s;illie&s;t is an attachment to forms. <HI>CRI.</HI> To &s;ay no more upon &s;o clear a point, the overturning a Go|vernment may be ju&s;tified upon the &s;ame Principles as the burning a Town, wou'd produce parallel ef|fects, and equally contribute to the public good. In both ca&s;es, the natural &s;prings of Action are forcibly exerted: and in this general Indu&s;try what one lo&s;es another gets, a quick circulation of Wealth and Power making the Sum Total to flouri&s;h. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And do the Minute Philo&s;ophers publi&s;h the&s;e things to the World? <HI>LYS.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed our Wri|ters proceed in Politics with greater caution than they think nece&s;&s;ary with regard to Religion. <HI>CRI.</HI> But tho&s;e things plainly follow from their Principles, and are to be admitted for the genuine Doctrine of the Sect, expre&s;&s;ed perhaps with more freedom and per|&s;picuity,
<PB N="56" REF="67">
than might be thought prudent by tho&s;e who wou'd manage the Public, or not offend weak brethren. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And pray, is there not need of caution, a Rebel, or Incendiary being Characters that many Men have a prejudice again&s;t? <HI>LYS.</HI> Weak People of all ranks have a world of ab&s;urd Pre|judices. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But the better &s;ort, &s;uch as State&s;|men and Legi&s;lators; do you think they have not the &s;ame Indi&s;po&s;ition towards admitting your Princi|ples? <HI>LYS.</HI> Perhaps they may; but the rea&s;on is plain. <HI>CRI.</HI> This puts me in mind of that ingenious Philo&s;opher, the Game&s;ter <HI>Glaucus,</HI> who u&s;ed to &s;ay, that State&s;men and Lawgivers may keep a &s;tir about right and wrong, ju&s;t and unju&s;t, but that, in truth, Property of every kind had &s;o often pa&s;&s;ed from the right owners by fraud and violence, that it was now to be con&s;idered as lying on the common, and with equal right belonged to every one that cou'd &s;eize it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> What are we to think then of Laws and Regulations relating to Right and Wrong, Crimes and Duties? <HI>LYS.</HI> They &s;erve to bind weak minds, and keep the Vulgar in awe: But no &s;ooner doth a true Genius ari&s;e, but he breaks his way to Greatne&s;s through all the trammels of Duty, Con&s;cience, Re|ligion, Law; to all which he &s;heweth him&s;elf infi|nitely &s;uperior.</P>

It is much the &s;ame as Popery, with this difference, that it is the more prude-like and di&s;agreeable thing of the two. A noted Writer of ours makes it too great a compliment, when he computes the benefit of Hooped-petticoats to be nearly equal to that of the Reformation. Thorough Reformation is thorough Liberty. Leave Nature at full freedom to work her own way, and all will be well. This is
<PB N="57" REF="68">
what we aim at, and nothing &s;hort of this can come up to our Principles. <HI>Crito,</HI> who is a zealous Prote|&s;tant, hearing the&s;e words, cou'd not refrain. The wor&s;t effect of the Reformation, &s;aid he, was the re&s;cuing wicked Men from a darkne&s;s which kept them in awe. This, as it hath proved, was holding out Light to Robbers and Murderers. Light in it &s;elf is good, and the &s;ame Light which &s;hews a Man the folly of Super&s;tition, might &s;hew him the truth of Religion, and the madne&s;s of Athei&s;m. But to make u&s;e of Light, only to &s;ee the Evils on one &s;ide, and never to &s;ee, but to run blindly upon the wor&s;e extreme, this is to make the be&s;t of things produce Evil, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that you prove the wor&s;t of things to produce Good, to wit, accidentally or in|directly: and by the &s;ame method of arguing, you may prove that even Di&s;ea&s;es are u&s;eful: but whate|ver benefit &s;eems to accrue to the Public, either from di&s;ea&s;e of Mind or Body, is not their genuine offspring, and may be obtained without them. <HI>Ly|&s;icles</HI> was a little di&s;concerted by the affirmative air of <HI>Crito;</HI> but after a &s;hort pau&s;e replied briskly, That to contemplate the public good was not every one's talent.

as much conduce to this end, as the mad &s;allies of Intemperance and Debauchery. <HI>LYS.</HI> I will ac|knowledge that a Nation may meerly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or be kept alive, but it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hou'd flouri&s;h without the aid of Vice. To produce a quick cir|culation of traffick and wealth in a State, there mu&s;t be exorbitant and irregular motions in the Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>EUPH.</HI> The more peo|ple a Nation contains, and the happier tho&s;e peo|ple are, the more that Nation may be &s;aid to flou|ri&s;h. I think we are agreed in this point. <HI>LYS.</HI> We are. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You allow then that Riches are not an ultimate end, but &s;hou'd only be con&s;idered as the means to procure Happine&s;s. <HI>LYS.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It &s;eems, that means cannot be of u&s;e without our knowing the end, and how to apply them to it. <HI>LYS.</HI> It &s;eems &s;o. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Will it not follow, that in order to make a Nation flouri&s;h, it is not &s;ufficient to make it wealthy, without knowing the true end and happine&s;s of Mankind, and how to apply wealth towards attaining that end? In proportion as the&s;e points are known and practi&s;ed, I think the Nation &s;hou'd be likely to flouri&s;h. But for a people who neither know nor practi&s;e them, to gain riches, &s;eems to me the &s;ame advantage that it wou'd be for a &s;ick Man to come at plenty of meat and drink, which he cou'd not u&s;e but to his hurt. <HI>LYS.</HI> This is meer &s;ophi&s;t|ry; it is arguing without per&s;uading.

<P>Having heard the&s;e words, <HI>Euphranor</HI> look|ed at <HI>Crito</HI> and me, and &s;aid &s;miling, I have mi&s;taken my part; it was mine to learn, and his to in&s;truct. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> Deal faithfully, &s;aid he, and let me know whether the public Benefit of Vice be in truth that which makes you plead for it? <HI>LYS.</HI> I love to &s;peak frankly what I think. Know then, that private Intere&s;t is the fir&s;t and prin|cipal con&s;ideration with Philo&s;ophers of our Sect.
<PB N="62" REF="73">
Now of all Intere&s;ts Plea&s;ure is that which hath the &s;tronge&s;t charms, and no Plea&s;ures like tho&s;e which are heightened and enlivened by licence. Herein con&s;i&s;ts the peculiar excellency of our Principles, that they &s;hew People how to &s;erve their Country by diverting them&s;elves, cau&s;ing the two &s;treams of public Spirit and Self-love to unite and run in the &s;ame channel. I have told you already, that I admit a Nation might &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the rules of Virtue. But give me leave to &s;ay, it will barely &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in a dull joyle&s;s in&s;ipid &s;tate, whereas the &s;prightly exce&s;&s;es of Vice in&s;pire Men with joy: And where Particulars rejoice, the Public, which is made up of Particulars, mu&s;t do &s;o too; that is, the Public mu&s;t be happy. This I take to be an irrefragable argument. But to give you its full force, and make it as plain as po&s;|&s;ible, I will trace things from their original. Hap|pine&s;s is the end to which created beings naturally tend, but we find that all Animals, whether Men or Brutes, do naturally and principally pur&s;ue real Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e, which is therefore to be thought their &s;upreme Good, their true End and Hap|pine&s;s. It is for this Men live, and whoever under|&s;tands Life mu&s;t allow that Man to enjoy the top and flower of it, who hath a quick &s;en&s;e of Plea&s;ure, and withal Spirit, Skill, and Fortune &s;ufficient to gratify every appetite and every ta&s;te. Niggards and Fools will envy or traduce &s;uch a one becau&s;e they cannot equal him. Hence, all that &s;ober trifling in di&s;pa|ragement of what every one wou'd be ma&s;ter of if he cou'd, a full freedom and unlimited &s;cope of Plea|&s;ure. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Let me &s;ee whether I under&s;tand you. Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e, you &s;ay, is the chief Plea|&s;ure. <HI>LYS.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And this wou'd be crampt and dimini&s;hed by Virtue. <HI>LYS.</HI> It wou'd. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> is Plea&s;ure then at the height when the Appetites are &s;atisfied? <HI>LYS.</HI> There is then only an Indolence, the lively &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="63" REF="74">
Plea&s;ure being pa&s;t. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It &s;hou'd &s;eem there|fore, that the appetites mu&s;t be always craving to pre|&s;erve Plea&s;ure alive. <HI>LYS.</HI> That is our &s;en&s;e of the matter. <HI>EUPH.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;opher therefore was in the right, who con&s;idered the body of a Man of plea&s;ure as a leaky Ve&s;&s;el, always filling and never full. <HI>LYS.</HI> You may divert your &s;elf with Allego|ries, if you plea&s;e. But all the while ours is literally the true ta&s;te of Nature. Look throughout the U|niver&s;e, and you &s;hall find Birds and Fi&s;hes, Bea&s;ts and In&s;ects, all kinds of Animals, with which the Crea|tion &s;warms, con&s;tantly engaged by in&s;tinct in the pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure. And &s;hall Man alone be the grave fool who thwarts, and cro&s;&s;es, and &s;ubdues his appetites, while his fellow-creatures do all mo&s;t joyfully and freely indulge them? <HI>EUPH.</HI> How! <HI>Ly&s;icles!</HI> I thought that being governed by the Sen&s;es, Appetites, and Pa&s;&s;ions, was the mo&s;t grievous Sla|very; and that the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of Free-thinkers, or Philo&s;ophers, had been to &s;et Men free from the power of Ambition, Avarice, and Sen&s;uality. <HI>LYS.</HI> You mi&s;take the point. We make Men reli&s;h the World, attentive to their Intere&s;ts, lively and luxuri|ous in their Plea&s;ures, without fear or re&s;traint either from God or Man. We de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e preaching Writers, who u&s;ed to di&s;turb or cramp the plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements of Human Life. We hold, that a wi&s;e Man who meddles with bu&s;ine&s;s, doth it alto|gether for his intere&s;t, and refers his intere&s;t to his plea&s;ure. With us it is a maxim, that a Man shou'd &s;eize the moments as they fly. Without Love, and Wine, and Play, and late hours, we hold Life not to be worth living. I grant, indeed, that there is &s;omething gro&s;s and ill-bred in the vices of mean Men, which the genteel Philo&s;opher abhors. <HI>CRI.</HI> But to cheat, whore, betray, get drunk, do all the&s;e things decently, this is true wi&s;dom, and elegance of ta&s;te.</P>

<P><HI>EUPH.</HI> To me, who have been us'd to another way of thinking, this new Philo&s;ophy &s;eems difficult to dige&s;t. I mu&s;t therefore beg leave to ex|amine its Principles, with the &s;ame freedom that you do tho&s;e of other Sects. <HI>LYS.</HI> Agreed. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You &s;ay, if I mi&s;take not, that a wi&s;e Man pur&s;ues only his private intere&s;t, and that this con&s;i&s;ts in &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ure, for proof whereof you appeal to Na|ture. Is not this what you advance? <HI>LYS.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You conclude therefore, that as other Ani|mals are guided by natural in&s;tinct, Man too ought to follow the dictates of &s;en&s;e and appetite. <HI>LYS.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But in this, do you not argue as if Man had only &s;en&s;e and appetite for his guides, on which &s;uppo&s;ition there might be truth in what you &s;ay? But what if he hath intellect, rea&s;on, a higher in|&s;tinct and a nobler life? If this be the ca&s;e, and you being Man, live like a Brute, is it not the way to be defrauded of your true happine&s;s? to be mortified and di&s;appointed? Con&s;ider mo&s;t &s;orts of Brutes; you &s;hall perhaps find them have a greater &s;hare of &s;en&s;ual happine&s;s than Man. <HI>LYS.</HI> To our &s;orrow we do. This hath made &s;everal Gentlemen of our Sect envy Brutes, and lament the lot of Humane Kind. <HI>CRI.</HI> It was a con&s;ideration of this &s;ort which in&s;pired <HI>Erotylus,</HI> with the laudable ambition of wi&s;hing him&s;elf a &s;nail, upon hearing of certain particularities di&s;covered in that animal by a modern Virtuo&s;o. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> if you had an inexhau&s;tible fund of gold and &s;ilver, &s;hou'd you envy another for having a little more copper than you? <HI>LYS.</HI> I &s;hou'd not. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Are not Rea|&s;on, Imagination, and Sen&s;e, Faculties differing in kind, and in rank higher one than another. <HI>LYS.</HI> I do not deny it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Their acts therefore dif|fer in kind. <HI>LYS.</HI> They do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Con&s;equent|ly the plea&s;ures perfective of tho&s;e acts are al&s;o diffe|rent. <HI>LYS.</HI> They are. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You admit therefore three &s;orts of plea&s;ure; plea&s;ure of Rea&s;on,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
plea&s;ure of imagination, and plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e. <HI>LYS.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And, as it is rea&s;onable to think, the operation of the highe&s;t and noble&s;t faculty to be attended with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, may we not &s;up|po&s;e the two former to be as gold or &s;ilver, and the latter only as copper? Whence it &s;hou'd &s;eem to fol|low, that Man need not envy or imitate a Brute. <HI>LYS.</HI> And neverthele&s;s there are very ingenious Men who do. And &s;urely every one may be allowed to know what he wants, and wherein his true happi|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Is it not plain that different Animals have different plea&s;ures? Take a Hog from his ditch or dunghil, lay him on a rich bed, treat him with &s;weet-meats, and mu&s;ic, and perfumes. All the&s;e things will be no entertainment to him. Do not a Bird, a Bea&s;t, a Fi&s;h, amu&s;e them&s;elves in vari|ous manners, in&s;omuch that what is plea&s;ing to one may be death to another? Is it ever &s;een that one of the&s;e Animals quits its own element or way of living, to adopt that of another? And &s;hall Man quit his own Nature to imitate a Brute? <HI>LYS.</HI> But Sen&s;e is not only natural to Brutes; is it not al&s;o natural to Man? <HI>EUPH.</HI> It is, but with this difference, it maketh the Whole of a Brute, but is the lowe&s;t part or faculty of a Humane Soul. The nature of any thing is peculiarly that which doth di&s;tingui&s;h it from other things, not what it hath in common with them. Do you allow this to be true? <HI>LYS.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And is not Rea&s;on that which makes the principal difference between Man and other Animals? <HI>LYS.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Rea&s;on therefore being the princi|pal part of our Nature, whatever is mo&s;t rea&s;onable &s;hou'd &s;eem mo&s;t natural to Man. Mu&s;t we not therefore think rational Plea&s;ures more agreeable to Human Kind, than tho&s;e of Sen&s;e? Man and Bea&s;t having different Natures, &s;eem to have different Fa|culties, different Enjoyments, and different &s;orts of Happine&s;s. You can ea&s;ily conceive, that the &s;ort of Life which makes the happine&s;s of a Mole or a

Bat, wou'd be a very wretched one for an Eagle. And may you not as well conceive that the happine&s;s of a Brute can never con&s;titute the true happine&s;s of a Man? A Bea&s;t, without Reflection or Remor&s;e, without Fore&s;ight or Appetite of Immortality, without notion of Vice or Virtue, or Order, or Rea|&s;on, or Knowledge! What motive, what grounds can there be for bringing down Man, in whom are all the&s;e things, to a level with &s;uch a creature?

<P><HI>LYS.</HI> It is &s;trange, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> that one who admits freedom of thought as you do, &s;hou'd yet be &s;uch a &s;lave to prejudice. You &s;till talk of order and virtue, as of real things, as if our Philo&s;ophers had never demon&s;trated, that they have no foundation in Nature, and are only the effects of Education. I know, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> how the Minute Philo&s;ophers are accu&s;tomed to demon&s;trate this point. They con&s;i|der the animal nature of Man, or Man &s;o far forth as he is animal; and it mu&s;t be owned that con&s;idered in that light, he hath no &s;en&s;e of Duty, no notion of Virtue. He therefore, who &s;hou'd look for Virtue among meer animals, or Human Kind as &s;uch, wou'd look in the wrong place. But that Philo&s;opher who is attentive only to the animal part of his Being, and rai&s;eth his Theorys from the very dregs of our Spe|cies, might probably upon &s;econd thoughts find him|&s;elf mi&s;taken. Look you, <HI>Crito,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> my argument is with <HI>Euphranor</HI> to whom addre&s;&s;ing his di&s;cour&s;e; I ob&s;erve, &s;aid he, that you &s;tand much upon the dignity of Humane Nature. This thing of dignity is an old worn-out notion, which depends on other notions old and &s;tale, and worn-out, &s;uch as an immaterial Spirit, and a Ray derived from the Di|vinity. But in the&s;e days Men of Sen&s;e make a je&s;t of all this Grandeur and Dignity; and many there
<PB N="67" REF="78">
are wou'd gladly exchange their &s;hare of it for the re|po&s;e and freedom, and &s;en&s;uality of a Brute. But compari&s;ons are odious: waving therefore all inquiry concerning the re&s;pective excellencies of Man and Bea&s;t, and whether it is beneath a Man to follow or imitate Brute Animals, in judging of the chief good and conduct of Life and Manners, I &s;hall be content to appeal to the Authority of Men them&s;elves, for the truth of my notions. Do but look abroad into the World, and ask the common run of Men, whe|ther plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e be not the only true, &s;olid, &s;ub|&s;tantial good of their kind? <HI>EUPH.</HI> But might not the &s;ame vulgar &s;ort of Men prefer a piece of Sign-po&s;t Painting to one of <HI>Raphael</HI>'s, or a <HI>Grub|&s;treet</HI> Ballad to an Ode of <HI>Horace?</HI> Is there not a real difference between good and bad Writing? <HI>LYS.</HI> There is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And yet you will allow there mu&s;t be a maturity and improvement of under&s;tanding to di&s;cern this difference, which doth not make it there|fore le&s;s real. <HI>LYS.</HI> I will. <HI>EUPH.</HI> In the &s;ame manner what &s;hou'd hinder, but there may be in na|ture a true difference between Vice and Virtue, al|though it require &s;ome degree of reflexion and judg|ment to ob&s;erve it?

Pure plea&s;ures of Rea&s;on and Imagination nei|ther hurt the health, nor wa&s;te the fortune, nor gall the con&s;cience. By them the mind is long entertain|ed without loathing or &s;atiety. On the other hand a notion (which with you it &s;eems pa&s;&s;eth for nothing) often embitters the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, which at bottom will be found al&s;o to depend upon notion more than perhaps you imagine, it being a vulgar remark, that tho&s;e things are more enjoyed by hope and foreta&s;te of the Soul than by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus much is yielded, that the actual enjoyment is very &s;hort, and the alternative of Appetite and Di&s;gu&s;t long as well as unea&s;y. So that, upon the whole, it &s;hould &s;eem tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are called Men of plea&s;ure from their eager pur&s;uit of it, do in reality with great expence of fortune, ea&s;e, and health pur|cha&s;e pain. <HI>LYS.</HI> You may &s;pin out plau&s;ible Ar|guments, but will after all find it a difficult matter to convince me that &s;o many ingenious Men &s;hou'd not be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between things &s;o directly op|po&s;ite as pain and plea&s;ure. How is it po&s;&s;ible to ac|count for this? <HI>CRI.</HI> I believe a rea&s;on may be a&s;|&s;igned for it, but to Men of plea&s;ure no truth is &s;o pa|latable as a fable. <HI>Jove</HI> once upon a time having or|dered, that plea&s;ure and pain &s;hou'd be mixed in equal proportions in every do&s;e of Humane Life, upon a complaint, that &s;ome Men endeavoured to &s;eparate what he had joined, and taking more than their &s;hare of the &s;weet, wou'd leave all the &s;our for others, com|manded <HI>Mercury</HI> to put a &s;top to this evil, by fixing on each Delinquent a pair of invi&s;ible Spectacles, which &s;hou'd change the appearance of things, mak|ing

It kills time beyond any thing, and is a mo&s;t admirable Anodyne to divert or prevent thought, which might otherwi&s;e prey upon the mind. <HI>CRI.</HI> I can ea&s;ily comprehend, that no Man upon Earth ought to prize Anodynes for the Spleen, more than a Man of fa&s;hi|on and plea&s;ure. An ancient Sage &s;peaking of one of that character, &s;aith he is made wretched by di&s;ap|pointments and appetites, <GAP DESC="foreign">. And if this was true of the <HI>Greeks</HI> who lived in the Sun, and had &s;o much Spirit, I am apt to think it is &s;till more &s;o of our modern <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Something there is in our climate and complexion, that makes idlene&s;s no where &s;o much its own puni&s;hment as in <HI>England,</HI> where an uneducated fine Gentleman pays for his mo|mentary plea&s;ures, with long and cruel intervals of Spleen; for relief of which he is driven into &s;en&s;ual exce&s;&s;es, that produce a proportionable depre&s;&s;ion of Spirits, which, as it createth a greater want of plea|&s;ures, &s;o it le&s;&s;ens the ability to enjoy them. There is a ca&s;t of Thought in the Complexion of an <HI>Eng|li&s;hman,</HI> which renders him the mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sful Rake in the World. He is (as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it) at variance with him&s;elf. He is neither Brute enough to enjoy his appetites, nor Man enough to govern them. He knows and feels that what he pur&s;ues is not his true good, his reflexion &s;erving only to &s;hew him that mi&s;ery which his habitual &s;loth and indo|lence will not &s;uffer him to remedy. At length being
<PB N="72" REF="83">
grown odious to him&s;elf, and abhorring his own Com|pany, he runs into every idle A&s;&s;embly, not from the hopes of plea&s;ure, but meerly to re&s;pite the pain of his own mind. Li&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y at the pre&s;ent, he hath no delight in reflecting on what is pa&s;t, or in the pro&s;pect of any thing to come. This Man of plea&s;ure, when after a wretched Scene of vanity and woe his animal nature is worn to the Stumps, wi&s;hes and dreads Death by turns, and is &s;ick of living, without having ever tried or known the true life of Man. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It is well this &s;ort of Life, which is of &s;o little benefit to the owner, conduceth &s;o much to that of the Public. But pray tell me, do the&s;e Gentlemen &s;et up for Minute Philo&s;ophers? <HI>CRI.</HI> That Sect you mu&s;t know contains two &s;orts of Phi|lo&s;ophers, the wet and the dry. Tho&s;e I have been de&s;cribing are of the former kind. They differ ra|ther in Practice than in Theory. As an older, graver or duller Man from one that is younger, and more ca|pable or fond of plea&s;ure. The dry Philo&s;opher pa&s;|&s;eth his time but drily. He has the honour of pimp|ing for the Vices of more &s;prightly Men, who in re|turn offer &s;ome &s;mall incen&s;e to his Vanity. Upon this encouragement, and to make his own mind ea&s;y when it is pa&s;t being plea&s;ed, he employs him&s;elf in ju&s;tifying tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es he cannot partake in. But to return to your que&s;tion, tho&s;e mi&s;erable Folk are mighty Men for the Minute Philo&s;ophy. <HI>EUPH.</HI> What hinders them then from putting an end to their lives? <HI>CRI.</HI> Their not being per&s;uaded of the Truth of what they profe&s;s. Some indeed in a fit of de&s;pair do now and then lay violent hands on them&s;elves. And as the Minute Philo&s;ophy prevails, we daily &s;ee more examples of Suicide. But they bear no propor|tion to tho&s;e who wou'd put an end to their lives if they dur&s;t. My friend <HI>Clinias,</HI> who had been one of them, and a Philo&s;opher of rank, let me into the &s;e|cret Hi&s;tory of their doubts and fears and irre&s;olute re&s;olutions of making away with them&s;elves, which
<PB N="73" REF="84">
la&s;t he a&s;&s;ures me is a frequent topic with Men of plea&s;ure, when they have drunk them&s;elves into a little Spirit. It was by virtue of this mechanical va|lour, the renowned Philo&s;opher <HI>Hermocrates</HI> &s;hot him&s;elf through the head. The &s;ame thing hath &s;ince been practi&s;ed by &s;everal others to the great re|lief of their friends. Splenetic, worried, and frigh|tened out of their wits, they run upon their doom, with the &s;ame courage as a Bird runs into the mouth of a Rattle Snake, not becau&s;e they are bold to die, but becau&s;e they are afraid to live. <HI>Clinias</HI> endeavour|ed to fortify his irreligion, by the di&s;cour&s;e and opini|on of other Minute Philo&s;ophers, who were mutu|ally &s;trengthened in their own unbelief by his. After this manner, authority working in a circle, they en|deavoured to atheize one another. But though he pretended even to a demon&s;tration again&s;t the Being of a God, yet he cou'd not inwardly conquer his own Belief. He fell &s;ick, and acknowledged this truth, is now a &s;ober Man and a good Chri&s;tian; owns he was never &s;o happy as &s;ince he became &s;uch, nor &s;o wretched as while he was a Minute Philo&s;opher. And he who has tried both conditions may be allowed a proper judge of both. <HI>LYS.</HI> Truly a fine account of the brighte&s;t and brave&s;t Men of the Age. <HI>CRI.</HI> Bright and brave are fine attributes. But our Curate is of opinion, that all your Free-thinking Rakes are either Fools or Cowards. Thus he argues; if &s;uch a Man doth not &s;ee his true Intere&s;t, he wants Sen&s;e, if he doth but dare not pur&s;ue it, he wants Courage. In this manner from the defect of Sen&s;e and Courage, he deduceth that whole Species of Men, who are &s;o apt to value them&s;elves upon both tho&s;e qualities. <HI>LYS.</HI> As for their Courage they are at all times ready to give proof of it; and for their under&s;tand|ing, thanks to nature, it is of a &s;ize not to be mea&s;ur|ed by Country Par&s;ons.</P>

<P>To make a right computation, &s;hou'd you not con|&s;ider all the faculties and all the kinds of Plea&s;ure, ta|king into your account the future as well as the pre|&s;ent, and rating them all according to their true va|lue? <HI>CRI.</HI> The <HI>Epicureans</HI> them&s;elves allowed, that Plea&s;ure which procures a greater Pain, or hin|ders a greater Plea&s;ure, &s;hou'd be regarded as a Pain; and, that Pain which procures a greater Plea&s;ure, or prevents a greater Pain, is to be accounted a Plea&s;ure. In order therefore to make a true e&s;timate of Plea|&s;ure, the great &s;pring of action, and that from whence the conduct of Life takes its bias, we ought to compute intellectual Plea&s;ures and future Plea&s;ures,
<PB N="75" REF="86">
as well as pre&s;ent and &s;en&s;ible: We ought to make allowance in the valuation of each particular Plea|&s;ure, for all the Pains and Evils, for all the Di&s;gu&s;t, Remor&s;e, and Shame that attend it: We ought to regard both kind and quantity, the &s;incerity, the in|ten&s;ene&s;s, and the duration of Plea&s;ures. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And all the&s;e points duly con&s;idered, will not <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;eem to have had rea&s;on of his &s;ide, when he thought ignorance made Rakes, and particularly their being ignorant of what he calls the Science of more and le&s;s, greater and &s;maller, equality and compari&s;on, that is to &s;ay of the art of Computing? <HI>LYS.</HI> All this di&s;cour&s;e &s;eems notional.

<P><HI>CRI.</HI> I cannot make them the &s;ame com|pliment that <HI>Euphranor</HI> does. For though I &s;hall not pretend to characterize the whole Sect, yet thus much I may truly affirm, That tho&s;e who have fallen in my way have been mo&s;tly raw Men of plea&s;ure, old Sharpers in bu&s;ine&s;s, or a third &s;ort of lazy Scio|li&s;ts, who are neither Men of bu&s;ine&s;s, nor Men of &s;peculation, but &s;et up for judges or critics in all kinds, without having made a progre&s;s in any.

Such as the&s;e, for the mo&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="87">
part, &s;eem to be Sectaries of the Minute Philo&s;ophy. I will not deny that now and then you may meet with a Man of ea&s;y manners, that, without tho&s;e faults and affectations, is carried into the party by the meer &s;tream of Education, Fa&s;hion, or Company; all which do in this age prejudice Men again&s;t Religion, even tho&s;e who mechanically rail at Prejudice. I mu&s;t not forget that the Minute Philo&s;ophers have al&s;o a &s;trong party among the Beaux and fine Ladies, and, as affectations out of character are often the &s;tronge&s;t, there is nothing &s;o dogmatical and incon|vincible as one of the&s;e fine things, when it &s;ets up for Free-thinking. But, be the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of the Sect never &s;o dogmatical, their authority mu&s;t needs be &s;mall with Men of &s;en&s;e: For who wou'd choo&s;e for his guide in the &s;earch for Truth, a Man who&s;e Thoughts and Time are taken up with Dre&s;s, Vi&s;its, and Diver&s;ions? Or who&s;e Education hath been be|hind a Counter, or in an Office? Or who&s;e Specu|lations have been employed on the forms of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, who are only well read in the ways and com|merce of Mankind, in &s;tock-jobbing, purloining, &s;upplanting, bribing? Or wou'd any Man in his &s;en&s;es give a fig for Meditations and Di&s;coveries made over a bottle? And yet it is certain, that in&s;tead of Thought, Books, and Study, mo&s;t Free-thinkers are the Pro&s;elytes of a drinking Club. Their Prin|ciples are often &s;ettled, and deci&s;ions on the deepe&s;t Points made, when they are not fit to make a bargain. <HI>LYS.</HI> You forget our Writers, <HI>Crito.</HI> They make a world of Pro&s;elytes. <HI>CRI.</HI> So wou'd wor&s;e Wri|ters in &s;uch a cau&s;e. Alas! how few read! and of the&s;e, how few are able to judge? How many wi&s;h your notions true? How many had rather be diver|ted than in&s;tructed? How many are convinced by a title? I may allow your rea&s;ons to be effectual, without allowing them to be good. Arguments, in them&s;elves of &s;mall weight, have great effect, when
<PB N="77" REF="88">
they are recommended by a mi&s;taken intere&s;t, when they are pleaded for by pa&s;&s;ion, when they are coun|tenanced by the humour of the age; and above all, with &s;ome &s;ort of Men, when they are again&s;t Law, Government, and e&s;tabli&s;hed Opinions, things which, as a wi&s;e or good Man wou'd not depart from without clear evidence, a weak or a bad Man will affect to di&s;parage on the &s;lighte&s;t Grounds. <HI>LYS.</HI> And yet the arguments of our Philo&s;ophers alarm. <HI>CRI.</HI> The force of their rea&s;oning is not what a|larms, their contempt of Laws and Government is alarming, their application to the young and igno|rant is dangerous. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But without di&s;puting or di&s;paraging their talent at Ratiocination, it &s;eems very po&s;&s;ible their &s;ucce&s;s might not be owing to that alone. May it not in &s;ome mea&s;ure be a&s;cribed to the defects of others, as well as to their own perfections? My friend <HI>Eucrates</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the Church wou'd thrive and flouri&s;h beyond all oppo&s;ition, if &s;ome certain per&s;ons minded Piety more than Politics, Practics than Polemics, Fundamentals than Con&s;ec|taries, Sub&s;tance than Circum&s;tance, Things than Notions, and Notions than Words. <HI>LYS.</HI> What|ever may be the cau&s;e, the effects are too plain to be denied. And when a con&s;idering Man ob&s;erves that our Notions do, in this mo&s;t learned and knowing age, &s;pread and multiply, in oppo&s;ition to e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Laws, and every day gain ground again&s;t a body &s;o numerous, &s;o learned, &s;o well &s;upported, protected, encouraged for the &s;ervice and defence of Religion: I &s;ay, when a Man ob&s;erves and con&s;iders all this, he will be apt to a&s;cribe it to the force of Truth, and the merits of our cau&s;e; which, had it been &s;up|ported with the revenues and e&s;tabli&s;hments of the Church and Univer&s;ities, you may gue&s;s what a fi|gure it wou'd make, by the figure that it makes without them. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It is much to be pitied, that the learned profe&s;&s;ors of your Sect do not meet with the encouragement they de&s;erve. <HI>LYS.</HI> All in

due time. People begin to open their eyes. It is not impo&s;&s;ible but tho&s;e revenues that in ignorant times were applied to a wrong u&s;e, may hereafter in a more enlightned age, be applied to a better. <HI>CRI.</HI> But why profe&s;&s;ors and encouragement for what needs no teaching? An acquaintance of mine has a mo&s;t ingenious Footman that can neither write nor read, who learned your whole Sy&s;tem in half an hour, he knows when and how to nod, &s;hake his head, &s;mile, and give a hint as well as the able&s;t Scep|tic, and is in fact a very Minute Philo&s;opher. <HI>LYS.</HI> Pardon me, it takes time to unlearn religious Preju|dices, and requires a &s;trong head. <HI>CRI.</HI> I do not know how it might have been once upon a time. But in the pre&s;ent laudable education, I know &s;eve|ral who have been imbued with no religious notions at all; and others who have had them &s;o very &s;light, that they rubbed off without the lea&s;t pains.</P>

<P><HI>Panope,</HI> young and beautiful, under the care of her Aunt, an admirer of the Minute Philo&s;ophy, was kept from learning the Principles of Religion, that &s;he might not be accu&s;tomed to believe with|out a rea&s;on, nor a&s;&s;ent to what &s;he did not compre|hend. <HI>Panope</HI> was not indeed prejudiced with reli|gious notions, but got a notion of Intriguing, and a notion of Play, which ruined her reputation by four|teen, and her fortune by four and twenty.

<P>The wheels of Government go on, though wound up by different hands; if not in the &s;ame form, yet in &s;ome other, perhaps a better. There is an endle&s;s variety in nature, weak Men, indeed, are prejudiced towards Rules and Sy&s;tems in Life and Government; and think if the&s;e are gone all is gone: But a Man of a great Soul and free Spirit delights in the noble experiment of blowing up Sy&s;tems and di&s;&s;olving Governments, to mold them anew upon other principles and in another &s;hape. Take my word for it; there is a pla&s;tic nature in things that &s;eeks its own end. Pull a State to pieces, jumble, confound, and &s;hake together the particles of Humane Society, and then let them &s;tand a while, and you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee them &s;ettle of them&s;elves in &s;ome convenient order, where heavy heads are lowe&s;t and Men of genius up|permo&s;t. <HI>EUPH.

Table, with half a dozen of Di&s;ciples about him. After he had talked about Religion in a manner, and with an air that wou'd make one think, Athei&s;m e&s;|tabli&s;hed by Law, and Religion only tolerated, he en|tered upon Civil Government, and ob&s;erved to his Audience, that the natural World was in a perpetu|al circulation: Animals, &s;aid he, who draw their &s;u&s;|tenance from the Earth, mix with that &s;ame Earth, and in their turn become Food for Vegetables, which again nouri&s;h the Animal kind: The Vapours that a&s;cend from this Globe de&s;cend back upon it in &s;how|ers: The Elements alternately prey upon each other: That which one part of nature lo&s;eth another gains, the &s;um total remaining always the &s;ame, being nei|ther bigger nor le&s;&s;er, better nor wor&s;e for all the&s;e inte&s;tine changes.

A Man there|fore who thinks deeply, and hath an eye on the whole Sy&s;tem, is no more a Bigot to Government than to Religion. He knows how to &s;uit him&s;elf to occa&s;i|ons, and make the be&s;t of every event: For the re&s;t, he looks on all tran&s;lations of power and property from one hand to another with a philo&s;ophic indiffer|ence. Our Lecturer concluded his di&s;cour&s;e with a mo&s;t ingenious Analy&s;is of all political and moral Virtues into their fir&s;t principles and cau&s;es, &s;hewing them to be meer fa&s;hions, tricks of State, and illu&s;i|ons on the Vulgar. <HI>LYS.</HI> We have been often told of the good effects of Religion and Learning, Chur|ches and Univer&s;ities: But I dare affirm, that a dozen or two ingenious Men of our Sect have done more towards advancing real knowledge, by extemporane|ous Lectures in the compa&s;s of a few years, than all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics put together for as many Centuries. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And the Nation no doubt thrives accor|dingly: But, it &s;eems, <HI>Crito,</HI> you have heard them di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>CRI.</HI> Upon hearing this and other Lec|tures

In the mean time, you Gentlemen, who have found out that there is nothing to be hoped or feared in another Life, that Con&s;cience is a Bugbear, that the bands of Government, and the cement of Human Society are rotten things, to be di&s;&s;olved and crumbled into nothing, by the ar|gumentation of every Minute Philo&s;opher, be &s;o good as to keep the&s;e &s;ublime di&s;coveries to your &s;elves: Suffer us, our Wives, our Children, our Servants and our Neighbours to continue in the Belief and way of Thinking e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws of our Country.

<P>But you will agree with me that the right way to come at this, was to begin with extirpating the prejudices of particular Per&s;ons. We have carried on this work for many years with much art and in|du&s;try, and at fir&s;t with &s;ecrecy, working like Moles under ground, concealing our progre&s;s from the Public, and our ultimate views from many, even of our own Pro&s;elytes, blowing the Coals between polemical Divines, laying hold on and improving every incident, which the pa&s;&s;ions and folly of Churchmen afforded, to the advantage of our Sect. As our principles obtained, we &s;till proceeded to farther inferences; and as our numbers multiplied, we gra|dually di&s;clo&s;ed our &s;elves and our Opinions; where we are now I need not &s;ay. We have &s;tubbed and weeded and cleared Humane Nature to that degree, that in a little time, leaving it alone without any la|bouring or teaching, you &s;hall &s;ee natural and ju&s;t Ideas &s;prout forth of them&s;elves. <HI>CRI.</HI> But I have heard a man, who had lived long and ob&s;erved much, remark that the wor&s;t and mo&s;t unwhole&s;om weed was this &s;ame Minute Philo&s;ophy. We have had, &s;aid he, divers epidemical di&s;tempers in the State, but this hath produced of all others the mo&s;t de&s;tructive Plague. Enthu&s;ia&s;m had its day, its effects were vio|lent and &s;oon over: This infects more quietly but &s;preads widely: The former bred a fever in the State, this breeds a con&s;umption and final decay. A Rebel|lion or an Inva&s;ion alarms and puts the Public upon its defence, but a corruption of principles works its ruin more &s;lowly perhaps, but more &s;urely. This may be illu&s;trated by a Fable I &s;omewhere met with in the writings of a <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Philo&s;opher, &s;etting forth the original of Brandy and Gun-powder. The Govern|ment of the North being once upon a time vacant, the Prince of the power of the air convened a Coun|cil in Hell, wherein upon competition between two Daemons of rank, it was determined they &s;hou'd both

One made his appearance in the &s;hape of Gunpowder, the other in that of Bran|dy: The former was a declared Enemy and roared with a terrible noi&s;e, which made folks afraid, and put them on their guard: The other pa&s;&s;ed as a Friend and a Phy&s;ician through the World, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf with Sweets and Perfumes and Drugs, made his way into the Ladies Cabinets, and the Apothe|caries Shops, and under the notion of helping dige|&s;tion, comforting the Spirits, and checring the Heart, produced direct contrary effects; and having in&s;en&s;i|bly thrown great numbers of Humane Kind into a lingring but fatal decay, was found to people Hell and the Grave &s;o fa&s;t as to merit the Governemnt which he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>LYS.</HI> Tho&s;e who plea&s;e may amu&s;e them|&s;elves with Fables and Allegories. This is plain <HI>Eng|li&s;h:</HI> Liberty is a good thing, and we are the &s;upport of Liberty. <HI>CRI.</HI> To me it &s;eems that Liberty and Virtue were made for each other. If any Man wi&s;h to en&s;lave his Country, nothing is a fitter preparative than Vice; and nothing leads to Vice &s;o &s;urely as Ir|religion. For my part I cannot comprehend or find out, after having con&s;idered it in all lights, how this crying down Religion &s;hou'd be the effect of hone&s;t views towards a ju&s;t and legal Liberty. Some &s;eem to propo&s;e an indulgence in Vice. Others may have in pro&s;pect the advantages which needy and ambitious Men are u&s;ed to make in the ruin of a State: One may indulge a pert petulant Spirit; another hope to be e&s;teemed among Libertines, when he wants wit to plea&s;e or abilities to be u&s;eful. But, be Mens views what they will, let us examine what good your prin|ciples have done; who has been the better for the in|&s;tructions of the&s;e Minute Philo&s;ophers? Let us compare what we are in re&s;pect of Learning, Loyalty, Hone&s;ty, Wealth, Power and Public Spirit with
<PB N="87" REF="98">
what we have been. Free-thinking (as it is called) hath wonderfully grown of late years. Let us &s;ee what hath grown up with it, or what effects it hath produced. To make a catalogue of ills is di&s;agree|able; and the only ble&s;&s;ing it can pretend to is Luxu|ry: That &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing which revenged the World upon old <HI>Rome:</HI> That &s;ame Luxury that makes a Na|tion like a di&s;ea&s;ed pampered body, look full and fat with one foot in the Grave. <HI>LYS.</HI> You mi&s;take the matter. There are no People who think and argue better about the public good of a State than our Sect; who have al&s;o invented many things tending to that end, which we cannot as yet conveniently put in practice. <HI>CRI.</HI> But one point there is from which it mu&s;t be owned the Public hath already received &s;ome advantage, which is the effect of your princi|ples flowing from them, and &s;preading as they do; I mean that old <HI>Roman</HI> practice of Self-murder which at once puts an end to all di&s;tre&s;s, ridding the World and them&s;elves of the mi&s;erable. <HI>LYS.</HI> You were plea&s;ed before to make &s;ome reflexions on this Cu&s;|tom, and laugh at the irre&s;olution of our Free-think|ers: But I can aver for matter of fact, that they have often recommended it by their example as well as arguments, and that it is &s;oley owing to them that a practice, &s;o u&s;eful and magnanimous, hath been taken out of the hands of Lunatics, and re&s;tored to that credit among Men of &s;en&s;e, which it anciently had. In whatever light you may con&s;ider it, this is in fact a &s;olid Benefit: But the be&s;t effect of our prin|ciples is that light and truth &s;o vi&s;ibly &s;hed abroad in the World. From how many prejudices, errors, perplexities and contradictions have we freed the minds of our Fellow-Subjects? How many hard words and intricate ab&s;urd notions had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of Men before our Philo&s;ophers appeared in the World? But now even Women and Children have right and &s;ound notions of things. What &s;ay you to this, <HI>Crito? CRI.</HI> I &s;ay, with re&s;pect to
<PB N="88" REF="99">
the&s;e great advantages of de&s;troying Men and Noti|ons, that I que&s;tion whether the Public gains as much by the latter as it lo&s;eth by the former. For my own part I had rather my Wife and Children all believed what they had no notion of and daily pronounced words without a meaning, than that any one of them &s;hou'd cut his Throat, or leap out of a Window. Errors and non&s;en&s;e as &s;uch are of &s;mall concern in the eye of the Public, which con&s;ider not the metaphy|&s;ical Truth of notions, &s;o much as the tendency they have to produce good or evil. Truth it &s;elf is valued by the Public, as it hath an influence, and is felt in the cour&s;e of Life. You may confute a whole &s;helf of Schoolmen, and di&s;cover many &s;peculative Truths, without any great merit towards your Country. But if I am not mi&s;taken, the Minute Philo&s;ophers are not the Men to whom we are mo&s;t beholden for di&s;|coveries of that kind: This I &s;ay mu&s;t be allowed &s;uppo&s;ing, what I by no means grant, your notions to be true. For, to &s;ay plainly what I think, the tendency of your opinions is &s;o bad, that no good Man can endure them, and your arguments for them &s;o weak that no wi&s;e Man will admit them. <HI>LYS.</HI> Has it not been proved as clear as the Meridian Sun, that the politer &s;ort of Men lead much happier lives, and &s;wim in plea&s;ure &s;ince the &s;preading of our Prin|ciples? But, not to repeat or in&s;i&s;t further on what has been &s;o amply deduced, I &s;hall only add that the advantages flowing from them, extend to the tender|e&s;t Age and the &s;ofter Sex: Our principles deliver Children from terrors by night, and Ladies from &s;plenetic hours by day. In&s;tead of the&s;e old fa&s;hion|ed things, Prayers and the Bible, the grateful amu&s;e|ments of Drams, Dice, and Billets-doux have &s;uc|ceeded. The fair Sex have now nothing to do but dre&s;s and paint, drink and game, adorn and divert them&s;elves, and enter into all the &s;weet Society of Life. <HI>CRI.</HI> I thought, <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> the argument from plea&s;ure had been exhau&s;ted; but &s;ince you have not
<PB N="89" REF="100">
done with that point, let us once more by <HI>Euphranor</HI>'s rule ca&s;t up the account of plea&s;ure and pain, as cre|dit and debt under di&s;tinct Articles. We will &s;et down in the life of your fine Lady, rich clothes, dice, cordials, &s;candal, late hours again&s;t vapours, di&s;ta&s;te, remor&s;e, lo&s;&s;es at play, and the terrible di&s;tre&s;s of ill &s;pent age increa&s;ing every day; &s;uppo&s;e no cruel ac|cident of jealou&s;y, no madne&s;s or infamy of love, yet at the foot of the account you &s;hall find that empty, giddy, gaudy, fluttering thing, not half &s;o happy as a butterfly, or a gra&s;hopper on a Summer's day: And for a Rake or Man of plea&s;ure, the reckoning will be much the &s;ame, if you place li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, ignorance, rottenne&s;s, loathing, craving, quarrelling, and &s;uch qualities or accompli&s;hments over again&s;t his little circle of fleeting amu&s;ements, long woe again&s;t mo|mentary plea&s;ure; and if it be con&s;idered that, when Sen&s;e and Appetite go off, though he &s;eek refuge from his Con&s;cience in the Minute Philo&s;ophy, yet in this you will find, if you &s;ift him to the bottom, that he affects much, believes little, knows nothing. Upon which <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> turning to me, ob&s;erved, that <HI>Crito</HI> might di&s;pute again&s;t fact if he plea&s;ed, but that every one mu&s;t &s;ee the Nation was the merrier for their principles. True, an&s;wered <HI>Crito,</HI> we are a merry Nation indeed: Young Men laugh at the old; Chil|dren de&s;pi&s;e their Parents; and Subjects make a je&s;t of the Government; happy effects of the Minute Phi|lo&s;ophy!</P>

The point at pre&s;ent is the u&s;efulne&s;s of your principles; and to decide this point we need only take a &s;hort view of them fairly propo&s;ed and laid together: That there is no God or Providence; that Man is as the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h; that his Happine&s;s as theirs con&s;i&s;ts in obeying animal in&s;tincts, appetites and pa&s;|&s;ions;
<PB N="90" REF="101">
that all &s;tings of con&s;cience and &s;en&s;e of guilt are prejudices and errors of Education; that Religion is a State trick; that Vice is beneficial to the Public; that the Soul of Man is corporeal and di&s;&s;olveth like a flame or vapour; that Man is a Ma|chine actuated according to the Laws of motion; that con&s;equently he is no agent or &s;ubject of guilt; that a wi&s;e Man will make his own particular indi|vidual intere&s;t in this pre&s;ent life, the rule and mea|&s;ure of all his actions: The&s;e and &s;uch Opinions are, it &s;eems, the Tenets of a Minute Philo&s;opher, who is him&s;elf according to his own principles an Organ play'd on by &s;en&s;ible objects, a Ball bandied about by appetites, and pa&s;&s;ions; &s;o &s;ubtle is he as to be able to maintain all this by artful rea&s;onings; &s;o &s;harp|&s;ighted and penetrating to the very bottom of things as to find out, that the mo&s;t intere&s;ted occult cunning is the only true wi&s;dom. To compleat his Character, this curious piece of Clockwork, having no princi|ple of Action within it &s;elf, and denying that it hath or can have any one Free Thought or Motion, &s;ets up for the Patron of Liberty, and earne&s;tly contends for <HI>Free-thinking.

Never did I in the whole cour&s;e of my life meet with a Man &s;o deeply immer&s;ed in Prejudice; let who will pull him out for me. But I entertain better hopes of you. I can an|&s;wer, &s;aid I, for my &s;elf, that my eyes and ears are al|ways open to Conviction: I am attentive to all that pa&s;&s;es, and upon the whole &s;hall form, whether right or wrong, a very impartial judgment. <HI>Crito,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Euphranor,</HI> is a more enterpri&s;ing Man than I, thus to rate and lecture a Philo&s;opher.

I am credibly informed there is a great number of Emi&s;&s;aries of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed in <HI>England:</HI> who can tell what harve&s;t a Clergy &s;o numerous, &s;o &s;ubtle, and &s;o well furni&s;hed with arguments to work on vulgar and uneducated minds, may be able to make in a Country de&s;poiled of all Religion, and feeling the want of it? Who can tell whether the Spirit of Free-thinking ending with the Oppo&s;ition, and the Vanity with the Di&s;|tinction, when the whole Nation are alike Infidels, who can tell, I &s;ay, whether in &s;uch a juncture the Men of Genius them&s;elves may not affect a new Di&s;|tinction, and be the fir&s;t converts to Popery? <HI>LYS.</HI> And &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hou'd. Between friends it wou'd be no great matter. The&s;e are our maxims. In the fir&s;t place we hold it wou'd be be&s;t to have no Religi|on at all. Secondly, we hold that all Religions are indifferent. If therefore upon trial we find the Coun|try cannot do without a Religion, why not Popery as well as another? I know &s;everal ingenious Men of our Sect, who, if we had a Popi&s;h Prince on the Throne, wou'd turn Papi&s;ts to-morrow. This is a Paradox, but I &s;hall explain it. A Prince whom we compliment with our Religion, to be &s;ure mu&s;t be grateful. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I under&s;tand you. But what becomes of Free-thinking all the while? <HI>LYS.</HI> Oh! we &s;hou'd have more than ever of that, for we &s;hou'd keep it all to our &s;elves. As for the amu&s;ement of retailing it, the want of this wou'd be largely com|pen&s;ated by &s;olid advantages of another kind. <HI>EUPH.</HI> It &s;eems then, by this account, the Ten|dency you ob&s;erved in the Nation towards &s;ome|thing great and New proves a Tendency towards Popery and Slavery. <HI>LYS.</HI> Mi&s;take us not, good <HI>Euphranor.</HI> The thing fir&s;t in our intention is Con|&s;ummate Liberty: But if this will not do, and there mu&s;t after all be &s;uch things tolerated as Religion

The two mo&s;t a|vowed, profe&s;&s;ed, bu&s;y, propagators of Infidelity in all companies, and upon all occa&s;ions, that I ever met with were both Bigotted Papi&s;ts, and being both Men of con&s;iderable e&s;tates, &s;uffered con&s;iderably on that &s;core; which, it is wonderful their Thinking Di&s;ciples &s;hou'd never reflect upon. <HI>Hegemon,</HI> a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Writer among the Minute Philo&s;ophers, and Hero of the Sect, I am well a&s;&s;ured, was once a Papi&s;t, and never heard that he profe&s;&s;ed any other Religion. I know that many of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> abroad, are plea&s;ed with the growth of Infidelity a|mong us, as hoping it may make way for them. The Emi&s;&s;aries of <HI>Rome</HI> are known to have per&s;onated &s;everal other Sects, which from time to time have &s;prung up among&s;t us, and why not this of the Mi|nute Philo&s;ophers, of all others the be&s;t calculated to ruin both Church and State? I my &s;elf have known a Je&s;uit abroad talk among <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen like a Free-thinker. I am credibly informed, that Je&s;uits, known to be &s;uch by the Minute Philo&s;o|phers at home, are admitted into their Clubs: And I have ob&s;erved them to approve, and &s;peak better of the Je&s;uits, than of any other Clergy what&s;oever. Tho&s;e who are not acquainted with the &s;ubtle Spirit, the refined Politics, and wonderful Occonomy of that renowned Society, need only read the account given of them by the Je&s;uit <HI>Inchofer,</HI> in his Book <HI>De Mo|narchia Solip&s;orum;</HI> and tho&s;e who are, will not be &s;urprized they &s;hou'd be able to make Dupes of our Minute Philo&s;ophers: Dupes, I &s;ay, for I can never think they &s;u&s;pect they are only tools to &s;erve the ends of cunninger Men than them&s;elves. They &s;eem to me drunk and giddy with a fal&s;e notion of Liberty, and &s;pur'd on by this principle to make mad Expe|riments on their Country, they agree only in pulling
<PB N="94" REF="105">
down all that &s;tands in their way; without any con|certed Scheme, and without caring or knowing what to erect in its &s;tead. To hear them, as I have often done, de&s;cant on the moral Virtues, re&s;olve them in|to Shame, then laugh at Shame as a weakne&s;s, ad|mire the unconfined lives of Savages, de&s;pi&s;e all order and decency of Education, one wou'd think the in|tention of the&s;e Philo&s;ophers was, when they had pruned and weeded the notions of their fellow-&s;ub|jects, and dive&s;ted them of their Prejudices, to &s;trip them of their Clothes, and fill the country with na|ked Followers of Nature, enjoying all the Privileges of Brutality. Here <HI>Crito</HI> made a pau&s;e, and fixed his eyes on <HI>Alciphron,</HI> who during this whole cover&s;ation had &s;ate thoughtful and attentive, without &s;aying a word, and with an air, one while di&s;&s;atisfied at what <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> advanced, another, &s;erene and plea&s;ed, &s;eem|ing to approve &s;ome better thought of his own.

So we changed the di&s;cour&s;e, and after a repa&s;t upon cold provi&s;ions, took a walk on the Strand, and in the cool of the evening returned to <HI>Crito</HI>'s.</P>

<P>THE following day as we &s;ate round the Tea|table, in a Summer-Parlour which looks into the Garden, <HI>Alciphron</HI> after the fir&s;t di&s;h turned down his cup, and reclining back in his Chair proceeded as follows. Above all the Sects upon earth it is the pe|culiar Privilege of ours, not to be tied down by any Principles. While other Philo&s;ophers profe&s;s a &s;er|vile adherence to certain Tenets, ours a&s;&s;ert a noble freedom, differing not only one from another, but very often the &s;ame Man from him&s;elf. Which me|thod of proceeding, be&s;ide other advantages, hath this annexed to it, that we are of all Men the harde&s;t to confute. You may, perhaps, confute a particu|lar
<PB N="96" REF="107">
Tenet, but then this affects only him who main|tains it, and &s;o long only as he maintains it. Some of our Sect dogmatize more than others, and in &s;ome more than other points. The Doctrine of the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of Vice is a point wherein we are not all a|greed. Some of us are great admirers of Virtue. With others the points of Vice and Virtue are pro|blematical. For my own part, though I think the Doctrine maintained ye&s;terday by <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> an inge|nious &s;peculation; yet, upon the whole, there are divers Rea&s;ons which incline me to depart from it, and rather to e&s;pou&s;e the Virtuous &s;ide of the que&s;ti|on; with the &s;malle&s;t, perhaps, but the mo&s;t contem|plative and laudable part of our Sect. It &s;eemeth, I &s;ay, after a nice inquiry and balancing on both &s;ides, that we ought to prefer Virtue to Vice; and that &s;uch preference wou'd contribute both to the public Weal, and the reputation of our Philo&s;ophers. You are to know then, we have among us &s;everal that, without one grain of Religion, are Men of the nice&s;t Honour, and therefore Men of Virtue be|cau&s;e Men of Honour. Honour is a noble unpollu|ted Source of Virtue, without the lea&s;t mixture of Fear, Intere&s;t or Super&s;tition. It hath all the ad|vantages without the evils which attend Religion. It is the mark of a great and fine &s;oul, and is to be found among Per&s;ons of Rank and Breeding. It af|fects the Court, the Senate, and the Camp, and in general every Rendezvous of people of fa&s;hion. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You &s;ay then that honour is the Source of Virtue. <HI>ALC.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Can a thing be the &s;ource of it &s;elf? <HI>ALC.</HI> It cannot. <HI>EUPH.</HI> The Source, therefore, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of which it is the Source. <HI>ALC.</HI> Doubtle&s;s. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Honour then is one thing and Virtue another. <HI>ALC.</HI> I grant it. Virtuous actions are the effect, and Ho|nour is the Source or Cau&s;e of that effect. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me. Is Honour the Will producing tho&s;e acti|ons, or the final Cau&s;e for which they are produced,
<PB N="97" REF="108">
or right Rea&s;on which is their rule and limit, or the Object about which they are conver&s;ant? Or do you by the word <HI>Honour</HI> under&s;tand a Faculty or Ap|petite? All which are &s;uppo&s;ed, in one &s;en&s;e or other, to be the Source of humane actions. <HI>ALC.</HI> Nothing of all this. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Be plea&s;ed then to give me &s;ome notion or definition of it. <HI>Alciphron</HI> having mu&s;ed a while an&s;wered, that he defined Honour to be a Principle of virtuous Actions. To which <HI>Eu|phranor</HI> replied; if I under&s;tand it rightly the word Principle is variou&s;ly taken. Sometimes by Princi|ples we mean the parts of which a whole is compo&s;ed, and into which it may be re&s;olved. Thus the Ele|ments are &s;aid to be principles of compound bodies. And thus words, &s;yllables, and letters are the princi|ples of Speech. Sometimes by Principle we mean a &s;mall particular &s;eed, the growth or gradual unfolding of which doth produce an Organized Body, animal or vegetable, in its proper &s;ize and &s;hape. Princi|ples at other times are &s;uppo&s;ed to be certain funda|mental Theorems in Arts and Sciences, in Religion and Politics. Let me know in which of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, or whether it be in &s;ome other &s;en&s;e that you under|&s;tand this word, when you &s;ay, Honour is a Princi|ple of Virtue. To this <HI>Alciphron</HI> replied, that for his part he meant it in none of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, but defi|ned Honour to be a certain Ardour or Enthu&s;ia&s;m that glowed in the brea&s;t of a gallant Man. Upon this, <HI>Euphranor</HI> ob&s;erved, it was always admitted to put the Definition in place of the thing defined. Is this allowed, &s;aid he, or not? <HI>ALC.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> May we not therefore &s;ay, that a Man of Honour is a warm Man, or an Enthu&s;ia&s;t? <HI>Alciphron</HI> hearing this declared that &s;uch exactne&s;s was to no purpo&s;e; that Pedants, indeed, may di&s;pute and define, but cou'd never reach that high &s;en&s;e of Honour which di&s;tingui&s;hed the fine Gentleman, and was a thing ra|ther to be felt than explained.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="110">
I can very &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you that by all I have heard or &s;een, I cou'd never find, that Honour, con&s;idered as a principle di&s;tinct from Con&s;cience, Religion, Rea&s;on, and Virtue, was more than an empty name. And I do verily believe, that tho&s;e who build upon that notion have le&s;s Virtue than other Men; and that what they have or &s;eem to have is owing to Fa&s;hion, (being of the reputable kind) if not to a Con&s;cience early imbued with religious prin|ciples, and afterwards retaining a Tincture from them without knowing it. The&s;e two principles &s;eem to account for all that looks like Virtue in tho&s;e Gentle|men. Your Men of Fa&s;hion in whom animal life abounds, a &s;ort of Bullies in Morality, who di&s;dain to have it thought they are afraid of Con&s;cience; the&s;e de&s;cant much upon Honour, and affect to be called Men of Honour, rather than con&s;cientious or hone&s;t Men. But, by all that I cou'd ever ob&s;erve, this &s;pecious Character, where there is nothing of Con&s;cience or Religion underneath, to give it life and &s;ub&s;tance, is no better than a meteor or painted cloud. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I had a confu&s;ed notion that Ho|nour was &s;omething nearly connected with truth, and that Men of Honour were the greate&s;t enemies to all Hypocri&s;y, Fallacy, and Di&s;gui&s;e. <HI>CRI.</HI> So far from that, an Infidel who &s;ets up for the nice&s;t Honour &s;hall, without the lea&s;t grain of Faith or Religion, pre|tend him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, take any te&s;t, join in any act of wor&s;hip, kneel, pray, receive the Sacrament to &s;erve an intere&s;t.

<P><HI>Alciphron,</HI> having heard all this with great compo&s;ure of mind and countenance, &s;pake as fol|lows. You are not to think, that our greate&s;t &s;trength lies in our greate&s;t Number, Libertines and meer Men of Honour. No: we have among us Philo&s;ophers of a very different character, Men of curious con|templation, not governed by &s;uch gro&s;s things as Sen&s;e and Cu&s;tom, but of an ab&s;tracted Virtue and &s;ublime Morals: and the le&s;s religious the more virtu|ous. For Virtue of the high and di&s;intere&s;ted kind no Man is &s;o well qualified as an Infidel, it being a mean and &s;elfi&s;h thing to be virtuous through fear or hope. The notion of a Providence and future State of Re|wards and Puni&s;hments, may indeed tempt or &s;care Men of abject &s;pirit into practices contrary to the na|tural bent of their Souls, but will never produce a true and genuine Virtue. To go to the bottom of things, to analy&s;e Virtue into its fir&s;t principles, and fix a &s;cheme of Duty on its true ba&s;is, you mu&s;t un|der&s;tand, that there is an idea of Beauty natural to the mind of Man. This all Men de&s;ire, this they are plea&s;ed and delighted with for its own &s;ake, purely from an In&s;tinct of Nature. A Man needs no argu|ments to make him di&s;cern and approve what is beau|tiful; it &s;trikes at fir&s;t &s;ight and attracts without a rea&s;on. And as this Beauty is found in the &s;hape and form of corporeal things; &s;o al&s;o is there analogous to it a Beauty of another kind, an order, a &s;ymmetry, and comeline&s;s in the moral world. And as the Eye perceiveth the one, &s;o the Mind doth by a certain in|terior &s;en&s;e perceive the other, which &s;en&s;e, talent, or faculty is ever quicke&s;t and pure&s;t in the noble&s;t Minds. Thus as by &s;ight I di&s;cern the Beauty of a Plant or an Animal, even &s;o the mind apprehends the
<PB N="101" REF="112">
moral Excellence, the Beauty, and Decorum of Ju&s;|tice and Temperance. And as we readily pronounce a Dre&s;s becoming or an Attitude graceful, we can, with the &s;ame free untutored judgment, at once de|clare, whether this or that Conduct or Action be comely and beautiful. To reli&s;h this kind of Beauty, there mu&s;t be a delicate and fine Ta&s;te: But where there is this natural Ta&s;te, nothing further is wanting, either as a principle to convince, or as a motive to induce Men to the love of Virtue. And more or le&s;s there is of this Ta&s;te or Sen&s;e in every creature that hath Rea&s;on. All Rational Beings are by nature &s;o|cial. They are drawn one towards another by natu|ral affections: they unite and incorporate into fami|lies, clubs, parties, and commonwealths by mutual Sympathy. As by means of the &s;en&s;itive Soul, our &s;everal di&s;tinct parts and members do con&s;ent towards the animal Functions, and are connected in one Whole: even &s;o, the &s;everal parts of the&s;e Rational Sy&s;tems or Bodies Politic, by virtue of this moral or interior Sen&s;e, are held together, have a fellow-feel|ing, do &s;uccour and protect each other, and jointly cooperate towards the &s;ame end. Hence that joy in Society, that propen&s;ion towards doing good to our Kind, that gratulation and delight in beholding the virtuous deeds of other Men, or in reflecting on our own. By contemplation of the fitne&s;s and order of the parts of a moral Sy&s;tem, regularly operating, and knit together by benevolent affections, the Mind of Man attaineth to the highe&s;t notion of Beauty, Ex|cellence, and Perfection: Seized and rapt with this &s;ublime idea, our Philo&s;ophers do infinitely de&s;pi&s;e and pity, whoever &s;hall propo&s;e or accept any other motive to Virtue. Intere&s;t is a mean ungenerous thing, de&s;troying the merit of Virtue, and Fal&s;hood of every kind is incon&s;i&s;tent with the genuine &s;pirit of Philo&s;ophy. <HI>CRI.</HI> The Love therefore that you bear to moral Beauty, and your pa&s;&s;ion for ab|&s;tracted Truth, will not &s;uffer you to think with pa|tience
<PB N="102" REF="113">
of tho&s;e fraudulent Impo&s;itions upon Man|kind, Providence, the Immortality of the Soul, and a future Retribution of rewards and puni&s;hments; which under the notion of promoting do, it &s;eems, de&s;troy all true Virtue, and at the &s;ame time contra|dict and di&s;parage your noble Theories, manife&s;tly tending to the perturbation and di&s;quiet of Mens minds, and filling them with fruitle&s;s hopes and vain terrors. <HI>ALC.</HI> Mens fir&s;t Thoughts and natural Notions are the be&s;t in moral matters. And there is no need, that Mankind &s;hou'd be preached, or rea|&s;oned, or frightened into Virtue, a thing &s;o natural and congenial to every Human Soul. Now if this be the ca&s;e, as it certainly is, it follows that all the ends of Society are &s;ecured without Religion, and that an Infidel bids fair to be the mo&s;t virtuous Man, in a true, &s;ublime and heroic Sen&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Alciphron,</HI> while you talk, I feel an affection in my &s;oul like the trembling of one lute, upon &s;triking the uni&s;on &s;trings of another. Doubt|le&s;s there is a Beauty of the mind, a Charm in Virtue, a Symmetry and Proportion in the moral world. This moral Beauty was known to the ancients by the name of <HI>Hone&s;tum</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">. And in order to know its force and influence, it may not be ami&s;s to inquire, what it was under&s;tood to be, and what light it was placed in by tho&s;e who fir&s;t con&s;idered it, and gave it a name: <GAP DESC="foreign"> according to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> is the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or laudable, according to <HI>Plato</HI> it is the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, plea&s;ant or profitable, which is meant with re&s;pect to a rea&s;onable mind and its true intere&s;t. Now I wou'd fain know whether a mind, which con&s;iders an action as laudable, be not carried beyond the bare action it &s;elf, to regard the opinion of others concerning it? <HI>ALC.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And whether this be a &s;uf|ficient ground or principle of Virtue, for a Man to act upon, when he thinks him&s;elf removed from the eye and ob&s;ervation of every other intelligent Being?
<PB N="103" REF="114">
<HI>ALC.</HI> It &s;eems not. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Again, I ask whether a Man who doth a thing plea&s;ant or profitable as &s;uch, might not be &s;uppo&s;ed to forbear doing it, or even to do the contrary, upon the pro&s;pect of greater plea|&s;ure or profit? <HI>ALC.</HI> He might. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Doth it not follow from hence, that the Beauty of Virtue or <GAP DESC="foreign">, in either <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s or <HI>Plato</HI>'s &s;en&s;e, is not a &s;ufficient principle or ground, to engage &s;en&s;ual and worldly-minded Men in the practice of it? <HI>ALC.</HI> What then? <HI>EUPH.</HI> Why then, it will follow that Hope of reward and Fear of puni&s;hment are highly expedient, to ca&s;t the balance of plea&s;ant and profitable on the &s;ide of virtue, and thereby very much conduce to the benefit of Human Society. <HI>Alciphron</HI> upon this appealed; Gentlemen, &s;aid he, you are witne&s;&s;es of this unfair proceeding of <HI>Eu|phranor,</HI> who argues again&s;t us, from explications given by <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> of the Beauty of Virtue, which are things we have nothing to &s;ay to; the Philo&s;ophers of our Sect ab&s;tracting from all Prai&s;e, Plea&s;ure, and Intere&s;t, when they are enamoured and tran&s;ported with that &s;ublime Idea.

Such are a Fellow-feeling with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, a Tenderne&s;s for our offspring, an Affection towards our friends, our neighbours, and our country, an Indignation again&s;t things ba&s;e, cruel, or unju&s;t.

Shou'd it not therefore &s;eem a very uncertain guide in morals, for a Man to follow his pa&s;&s;ion or inward feeling? and wou'd not this rule infallibly lead different Men dif|ferent ways, according to the prevalency of this or that appetite or pa&s;&s;ion? <HI>ALC.</HI> I do not deny it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And will it not follow from hence, that Duty and Virtue are in a fairer way of being practi&s;ed, if Men are led by Rea&s;on and Judgment, balancing low and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures with tho&s;e of a higher kind, comparing pre&s;ent lo&s;&s;es with future gains, and the unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t of every Vice with the delight|ful practice of the oppo&s;ite Virtue, and the plea&s;ing reflexions and hopes which attend it?

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> I tell you, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> we contemn the Virtue of that Man, who computes and delibe|rates, and mu&s;t have a rea&s;on for being virtuous. The refined Morali&s;ts of our Sect are ravi&s;hed and tran&s;|ported with the ab&s;tract Beauty of Virtue. They di&s;dain all forin&s;ecal motives to it; and love Virtue only for Virtue's &s;ake. Oh Rapture! Oh Enthu&s;i|a&s;m! Oh the Quinte&s;&s;ence of Beauty! Methinks I cou'd dwell for ever on this Contemplation: But ra|ther than entertain my &s;elf, I mu&s;t endeavour to con|vince you. Make an experiment on the fir&s;t Man you meet. Propo&s;e a villanous or unju&s;t action. Take his fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of the matter, and you &s;hall find he dete&s;ts it. He may, indeed, be afterwards mi&s;led by Arguments or overpowered by Temptation, but his original unpremeditated and genuine thoughts are ju&s;t and orthodox. How can we account for this but by a moral &s;en&s;e, which, left to it &s;elf, hath as quick and true a perception of the Beauty and Defor|mity of Human Actions, as the Eye hath of Co|lours? <HI>EUPH.</HI> May not this be &s;ufficiently ac|counted for, by Con&s;cience, Affection, Pa&s;&s;ion, Education, Rea&s;on, Cu&s;tom, Religion, which principles and habits, for ought I know, may be what you metaphorically call a Moral Sen&s;e. <HI>ALC.</HI> What I call a moral &s;en&s;e is &s;trictly, properly, and truly &s;uch, and in kind different from all tho&s;e things you enumerate.

Whence is it that the Ea&s;tern Nati|ons, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> naturally ran into the mo&s;t becoming Dre&s;&s;es, while our <HI>Gothic</HI> Gentry, after &s;o many Centuries racking their Inventions, mending, and altering, and improving, and whirling, about in a perpetual rotation of Fa&s;hions, have ne|ver yet had the luck to &s;tumble on any that was not ab&s;urd and ridiculous? It is not from hence, that in|&s;tead
<PB N="111" REF="122">
of con&s;ulting U&s;e, Rea&s;on, and Convenience, they abandon them&s;elves to irregular Fancy, the un|natural Parent of Mon&s;ters? Whereas the Ancients, con&s;idering the u&s;e and end of Dre&s;s, made it &s;ub&s;er|vient to the Freedom, Ea&s;e, and Convenience of the Body, and, having no Notion of mending or changing the natural Shape, they aimed only at &s;hewing it with decency and advantage. And, if this be &s;o, are we not to conclude that the Beauty of Dre&s;s depends on its &s;ub&s;erviency to certain Ends and U&s;es? <HI>ALC.</HI> This appears to be true. <HI>EUPH.</HI> This &s;ubordinate relative nature of Beauty, perhaps will be yet plainer, if we examine the re&s;pective Beauties of a Hor&s;e and a Pillar. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s De&s;crip|tion of the former is,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Illi ardua cervix,</L>
<L>Argutumque caput, brevis alvus, obe&s;aque terga,</L>

<P>Now I wou'd fain know, whether the perfections and u&s;es of a Hor&s;e may not be reduced to the&s;e three points, Courage, Strength, and Speed; and whether each of the Beauties enumerated doth not occa&s;ion, or betoken, one of the&s;e Perfections? Af|ter the &s;ame manner, if we inquire into the Parts and Proportions of a beautiful Pillar, we &s;hall perhaps find them an&s;wer to this &s;ame Idea. Tho&s;e who have con&s;idered the Theory of Architecture, tell us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the learned Patriarch of <HI>Aquilcia</HI>'s Commentary on <HI>Vitru|vius,</HI> l. 4. c. 1.</NOTE>, the Proportions of the three <HI>Grecian</HI> Orders were taken from the Human Body, as the mo&s;t beautiful and perfect Production of Nature. Hence were derived tho&s;e graceful Ideas of Columns, which had a Character of Strength without clum&s;ine&s;s, or of Delicacy without weakne&s;s. Tho&s;e beautiful Proportions were, I &s;ay, taken originally from Na|ture, which, in her Creatures, as hath been already ob&s;erved, referreth them to &s;ome end, u&s;e, or de&s;ign.
<PB N="112" REF="123">
The <HI>Gon&s;iezza</HI> al&s;o, or &s;welling, and the diminution of a Pillar, is it not in &s;uch proportion as to make it appear &s;trong and light at the &s;ame time? In the &s;ame manner mu&s;t not the whole Entablature, with its Projections be &s;o proportioned, as to &s;eem great but not heavy, light but not little, ina&s;much as a Devia|tion into either extreme wou'd thwart that rea&s;on and u&s;e of Things, wherein their Beauty is founded, and to which it is &s;ubordinate? The Entablature and all its Parts and Ornaments, Architrave, Freeze, Cornice, Triglyphs, Metopes, Modiglions, and the re&s;t, have each an u&s;e or appearance of u&s;e, in giving firmne&s;s and union to the Building, in protecting it from the Weather, and ca&s;ting off the Rain, in re|pre&s;enting the Ends of Beams with their intervals, the production of Rafters, and &s;o forth. And if we con&s;ider the graceful Angels in Fronti&s;pieces, the Spaces between the Columns, or the Ornaments of their Capitels, &s;hall we not find, that their Beauty ri&s;eth from the appearance of U&s;e, or the imitation of natural Things, who&s;e Beauty is originally found|ed on the &s;ame Principle? which is, indeed, the grand di&s;tinction between <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Gothic</HI> Ar|chitecture, the latter being fanta&s;tical, and for the mo&s;t part founded neither in Nature nor in Rea&s;on, in Nece&s;&s;ity nor U&s;e, the appearance of which ac|counts for all the Beauty, Grace, and Ornament of the other. <HI>CRI.</HI> What <HI>Euphranor</HI> has &s;aid confirms the Opinion I always entertained, that the Rules of Architecture were founded, as all other Arts which flouri&s;hed among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> in Truth, and Nature, and good Sen&s;e. But the Ancients, who, from a thorough con&s;ideration of the Grounds and Princi|ples of Art, formed their Idea of Beauty, did not always confine them&s;elves &s;trictly to the &s;ame Rules and Proportions: But, whenever the particular Di|&s;tance, Po&s;ition, Elevation, or Dimen&s;ion of the Fabric or its Parts &s;eemed to require it, made no &s;cruple to depart from them, without de&s;erting the

original Principles of Beauty, which governed what|ever Deviations they made. This latitude or licence might not, perhaps, be &s;afely tru&s;ted with mo&s;t mo|dern Architects, who in their bold Sallies &s;eem to act without aim or de&s;ign, and to be governed by no Idea, no Rea&s;on or principle of Art, but pure Caprice, joined with a thorough contempt of that noble Sim|plicity of the Ancients, without which there can be no unity, gracefulne&s;s, or grandeur in their Works; which of con&s;equence mu&s;t &s;erve only to disfigure and di&s;honour the Nation, being &s;o many Monu|ments to future Ages of the opulence and ill ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent; which, it is to be feared, wou'd &s;uc|ceed as wretchedly, and make as mad work in other Affairs, were Men to follow, in&s;tead of rules, pre|cepts and models, their own ta&s;te and fir&s;t thoughts of Beauty. <HI>ALC.</HI> I &s;hou'd now, methinks, be glad to &s;ee a little more di&s;tinctly the u&s;e and tendency of this Digre&s;&s;ion upon Architecture. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Was not Beauty the very thing we inquired after? <HI>ALC.</HI> It was. <HI>EUPH.</HI> What think you, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> can the appearance of a thing plea&s;e at this time, and in this place, which plea&s;ed two thou&s;and Years ago, and two thou&s;and Miles off, without &s;ome real prin|ciple of Beauty? <HI>ALC.</HI> It cannot. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And is not this the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to a ju&s;t piece of Ar|chitecture? <HI>ALC.</HI> No body denies it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Architecture, the noble Offspring of judgment and fancy, was gradually formed in the mo&s;t polite and knowing Countries of <HI>A&s;ia, Egypt, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Ita|ly.</HI> It was cheri&s;hed and e&s;teemed by the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing States, and mo&s;t renowned Princes, who with va&s;t expence improved and brought it to perfection.

<P>In a Sy&s;tem of Spirits, &s;ubordinate to the Will, and under the Direction, of the Father of Spi|rits, governing them by Laws, and conducting them by Methods &s;uitable to wi&s;e and good Ends, there will be great Beauty. But in an incoherent, fortuitous Sy&s;tem governed by Chance, or in a blind Sy&s;tem governed by Fate, or in any Sy&s;tem where Providence doth not pre&s;ide, how can Beauty be, which cannot be without order, which cannot be without de&s;ign? When a Man is con&s;cious that his will is inwardly conformed to the Divine Will, pro|ducing Order and Harmony in the Univer&s;e, and conducting the whole by the ju&s;te&s;t Methods to the be&s;t End: This gives a beautiful Idea.

rewarded by God, ill-u&s;ed in this World, without Hope or Pro&s;pect of being better u&s;ed in another, I wou'd fain know, where is the Plea&s;ure of this Re|flection, where is the Beauty of this Scene? Or how cou'd any Man, in his Sen&s;es, think the &s;preading &s;uch Notions the way to &s;pread or propagate Virtue in the World? Is it not, I be&s;eech you an ugly Sy&s;tem in which you can &s;uppo&s;e no Law and prove no Duty, wherein Men thrive by Wickedne&s;s and &s;uffer by Virtue? Would it not be a di&s;agreeable Sight to &s;ee an hone&s;t Man peeled by Sharpers, to &s;ee virtuous Men injured and de&s;pi&s;ed while Vice triumph'd? An Enthu&s;ia&s;t may entertain him&s;elf with Vi&s;ions and fine Talk about &s;uch a Sy&s;tem; but when it comes to be con&s;idered by Men of cool Heads, and clo&s;e Rea|&s;on, I believe they will find no Beauty nor Perfection in it; nor will it appear, that &s;uch a moral Sy&s;tem can po&s;&s;ibly come from the &s;ame Hand, or be of a piece with the natural, throughout which there &s;hines &s;o much Order, Harmony, and Proportion. <HI>ALC.</HI> Your Di&s;cour&s;e &s;erves to confirm me in my Opinion.

to Virtue in an Irreligious Sy&s;tem, it cannot be le&s;s in a Religious, unle&s;s you will &s;uppo&s;e that her Charms dimini&s;h as her Dowry increa&s;eth. The Truth is, a Believer hath all the Motives from the Beauty of Vir|tue in any &s;en&s;e what&s;oever that an Unbeliever can po&s;&s;ibly have, be&s;ides other Motives which an Unbe|liever hath not. Hence it is plain, tho&s;e of your Sect, who have Moral Virtue, owe it not to their peculiar Tenets, which &s;erve only to le&s;&s;en the Motives to Virtue. Tho&s;e therefore, who are good, are le&s;s good, and tho&s;e who are bad are more bad, than they wou'd have been were they Believers. <HI>EUPH.</HI> To me it &s;eems, tho&s;e heroic infidel Inamorato's of ab|&s;tracted Beauty are much to be pitied, and much to be admired. <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> hearing this, &s;aid with &s;ome Im|patience; Gentlemen, You &s;hall have my whole Thoughts upon this Point plain and frank.

The <GAP DESC="foreign"> and the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the beautiful and decent, are Things outward, relative, and &s;uperfici|al, which have no Effect in the dark, but are &s;peci|ous Topics to di&s;cour&s;e and expatiate upon, as &s;ome formal Pretenders of our Sect, though in other Points very Orthodox, are u&s;ed to do. But &s;hou'd one of them get into Power, you wou'd find him no &s;uch Fool as <HI>Euphranor</HI> imagines. He wou'd &s;oon &s;hew he had found out, that the Love of one's Coun|try is a Prejudice: That Mankind are Rogues and Hypocrites, and that it were Folly to &s;acrifice one's &s;elf for the &s;ake of &s;uch: That all Regards center in this Life, and that, as this Life is to every Man his own Life, it clearly follows that Charity begins at Home. Benevolence to Mankind is perhaps pretend|ed, but Benevolence to him&s;elf is practi&s;ed by the Wi&s;e. The livelier &s;ort of our Philo&s;ophers do not &s;cruple to own the&s;e Maxims; and as for the graver, if they are true to their Principles, one may gue&s;s

I ob|&s;erved, &s;aid he, that, as Infidelity grew, there grew Corruption of every kind, and new Vices. This &s;imple Ob&s;ervation on matter of Fact was &s;ufficient to make him, notwith&s;tanding the Remon&s;trance of &s;everal ingenious Men, imbue and &s;ea&s;on the Minds of his Children betimes with the Principles of Reli|gion. The new Theories, which our acute Mo|derns have endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute in place of Religion, have had their full Cour&s;e in the pre&s;ent Age, and produced their Effect on the Minds and Manners of Men. That Men are Men is a &s;ure Max|im: But it is as &s;ure that <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are not the &s;ame Men they were; whether better or wor&s;e, more or le&s;s virtuous, I need not &s;ay. Every one may &s;ee and judge. Though, indeed, after <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> had been bani&s;hed, and <HI>Socrates</HI> put to death at <HI>Athens,</HI> a Man, without being a Conjurer, might gue&s;s what the Beauty of Virtue cou'd do in <HI>England.</HI> But there is now neither room nor occa&s;ion for gue&s;&s;ing.

Is this what you aim at? <HI>EUPH.</HI> I only make a plain Inference from what you grant. As for my &s;elf, I do not believe your Opinions true.

But I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I cannot reconcile the recei|ved Notions of a God and Providence to my Un|der&s;tanding, and my Nature abhors the Ba&s;ene&s;s of conniving at a Fal&s;hood. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Shall we there|fore appeal to Truth, and examine the Rea&s;ons by which you are withheld from believing the&s;e Points? <HI>ALC.</HI> With all my Heart, but enough for the pre|&s;ent.

<P>EARLY the next Morning, as I looked out of my Window, I &s;aw <HI>Alciphron</HI> walking in the Garden with all the Signs of a Man in deep Thought. Upon which I went down to him. <HI>Al|ciphron,</HI> &s;aid I, this early and profound Meditation puts me in no &s;mall Fright. How &s;o! Becau&s;e I &s;hou'd be &s;orry to be convinced there was no God. The Thought of Anarchy in Nature is to me more &s;hocking than in Civil Life; ina&s;much as Natural Concerns are more important than Civil and the Ba&s;is of all others. I grant, replied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> that &s;ome Inconvenience may po&s;&s;ibly follow from di&s;proving a God, but as to what you &s;ay of Fright and Shocking, all that is nothing but mere Prejudice. Men frame an Idea or Chimaera in their own Minds, and then fall down and wor&s;hip it. Notions govern Man-kind, but of all Notions, that of God's governing the World hath taken the deepe&s;t Root and &s;pread the farthe&s;t: It is therefore in Philo&s;ophy an heroi|cal Atchievement to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s this imaginary Mo|narch of his Government, and bani&s;h all tho&s;e Fears and Spectres which the Light of Rea&s;on alone can di&s;pel;</P>

<P>My Part, &s;aid I, &s;hall be to &s;tand by, as I have hi|therto done, and take Notes of all that pa&s;&s;eth du|ring this memorable Event, while a Minute Philo&s;o|pher not &s;ix Foot high attempts to dethrone the Mo|narch of the Univer&s;e. Alas! replied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> Arguments are not to be mea&s;ured by Feet and Inches. One Man may &s;ee more than a Million; and a &s;hort Argument, managed by a Free-thinker, may be &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="130" REF="141">
to overthrow the mo&s;t Gigantic Chimaera. As we were engaged in this Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Crito</HI> and <HI>Eu|phranor</HI> joined us. I find you have been beforehand with us to day, &s;aid <HI>Crito</HI> to <HI>Alciphron,</HI> and taken the Advantage of Solitude and early Hours, while <HI>Eu|phranor</HI> and I were a&s;leep in our Beds.

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALC.</HI> The Being of a God is a Subject upon which there has been a world of Common-place, which it is needle&s;s to repeat. Give me leave there|fore to lay down certain Rules and Limitations, in order to &s;horten our pre&s;ent Conference. For as the End of debating is to per&s;uade, all tho&s;e Things which are foreign to this End &s;hou'd be left out of our Debate. Fir&s;t then, let me tell you, I am not to be per&s;uaded by Metaphy&s;ical Arguments; &s;uch for In&s;tance as are drawn from the Idea of an All-perfect Being, or the Ab&s;urdity of an infinite Pro|gre&s;&s;ion of Cau&s;es. This &s;ort of Arguments I have always found dry and jejune; and, as they are not &s;uited to my way of Thinking, they may perhaps puzzle, but never will convince me. Secondly, I am not to be per&s;uaded by the Authority either of pa&s;t or pre&s;ent Ages, of Mankind in general, or of particular wi&s;e Men, all which pa&s;&s;eth for little or nothing with a Man of &s;ound Argument and free Thought. Thirdly, All Proofs drawn from Utility or Convenience are foreign to the purpo&s;e. They may prove indeed the U&s;efulne&s;s of the Notion, but not the Exi&s;tence of the Thing. Whatever Legi&s;la|tors or State&s;men may think, Truth and Convenience are very different Things to the rigorous Eyes of a Philo&s;opher. And now, that I may not &s;eem par|tial, I will limit my&s;elf al&s;o not to object, in the fir&s;t place, from any thing that may &s;eem irregular or un|accountable in the Works of Nature, again&s;t a Cau&s;e of infinite Power and Wi&s;dom; becau&s;e I already
<PB N="131" REF="142">
know the An&s;wer you wou'd make, to wit, That no one can judge of the Symmetry and U&s;e of the Parts of an infinite Machine, which are all relative to each other, and to the whole, without being able to comprehend the intire Machine or the whole U|niver&s;e. And in the &s;econd place, I &s;hall engage my &s;elf not to object again&s;t the Ju&s;tice and Provi|dence of a Supreme Being, from the Evil that befals good Men, and the Pro&s;perity which is often the Portion of wicked Men in this Life, becau&s;e I know that, in&s;tead of admitting this to be an Objection a|gain&s;t a Deity, you wou'd make it an Argument for a future State; in which there &s;hall be &s;uch a Retri|bution of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, as may vindi|cate the Divine Attributes, and &s;et all Things right in the End. Now the&s;e An&s;wers, though they &s;hou'd be admitted for good ones are in truth no Proofs of the Being of God, but only Solutions of certain Difficulties which might be objected, &s;up|po&s;ing it already proved by proper Arguments. Thus much I thought fit to premi&s;e, in order to &s;ave Time and Trouble both to you and my&s;elf. <HI>CRI.</HI> I think that, as the proper End of our Conference ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed the Di&s;covery and Defence of Truth, &s;o Truth may be ju&s;tified, not only by per|&s;uading its Adver&s;aries, but, where that cannot be done, by &s;hewing them to be unrea&s;onable. Argu|ments, therefore, which carry Light, have their Ef|fect, even again&s;t an Opponent who &s;huts his Eyes, becau&s;e they &s;hew him to be ob&s;tinate and prejudiced. Be&s;ides, this Di&s;tinction between Arguments that puzzle and that convince, is lea&s;t of all ob&s;erved by Minute Philo&s;ophers, and need not therefore be ob|&s;erved by others in their favour. But, perhaps <HI>Euphra|nor</HI> may be willing to encounter you on your own Terms, in which Ca&s;e I have nothing farther to &s;ay.</P>

<P><HI>EUPH. Alciphron</HI> acts like a skilful Gene|ral, who is bent upon gaining the Advantage of the
<PB N="132" REF="143">
Ground, and alluring the Enemy out of their Trench|es. We, who believe a God, are intrenched within Tradition, Cu&s;tom, Authority, and Law. And ne|verthele&s;s, in&s;tead of attempting to force us, he pro|po&s;es that we &s;hou'd voluntarily abandon the&s;e In|trenchments, and make the Attack, when we may act on the defen&s;ive with much Security and Ea&s;e, leaving him the Trouble to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s us of what we need not re&s;ign. Tho&s;e Rea&s;ons (continued he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Alciphron)</HI> which you have mu&s;ter|ed up in this Morning's Meditation, if they do not weaken, mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h our Belief of a God; for the utmo&s;t is to be expected from &s;o great a Ma&s;ter in his Profe&s;&s;ion, when he &s;ets his Strength to a Point. <HI>ALC.</HI> I hold the confu&s;ed Notion of a Deity, or &s;ome invi&s;ible Power, to be of all Prejudices the mo&s;t unconquerable. When half a dozen ingenious Men are got together over a Gla&s;s of Wine, by a chear|ful Fire, in a Room well lighted, we bani&s;h with ea&s;e all the Spectres of Fancy or Education, and are very clear in our Deci&s;ions. But, as I was taking a &s;olitary Walk before it was broad Day-light in yonder Grove, me thought the Point was not quite &s;o clear; nor cou'd I readily recollect the Force of tho&s;e Argu|ments, which u&s;ed to appear &s;o conclu&s;ive at other Times. I had I know not what Awe upon my Mind, and &s;eemed haunted by a &s;ort of Panic, which I can|not otherwi&s;e account for, than by &s;uppo&s;ing it the Effect of Prejudice: For you mu&s;t know, that I, like the re&s;t of the World, was once upon a Time catechi&s;ed and tutored into the Belief of a God or Spirit. There is no &s;urer Mark of Prejudice, than the believing a Thing without Rea&s;on. What Ne|ce&s;&s;ity then can there be that I &s;hou'd &s;et my&s;elf the difficult Task of proving a Negative, when it is &s;uf|ficient to ob&s;erve that there is no Proof of the Affir|mative, and that the admitting it without Proof is unrea&s;onable? Prove therefore your Opinion, or, if you cannot, you may indeed remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="133" REF="144">
it, but you will only be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Prejudice. <HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Alciphron,</HI> to content you we mu&s;t prove, it &s;eems, and we mu&s;t prove upon your own Terms. But, in the fir&s;t place, let us &s;ee what &s;ort of Proof you expect. <HI>ALC.</HI> Perhaps I may not expect it, but I will tell you what &s;ort of Proof I wou'd have: And that is in &s;hort, &s;uch Proof as every Man of Sen&s;e requires of a Matter of Fact, or the Exi&s;tence of any other particular Thing. For In&s;tance, &s;hou'd a Man ask why I believe there is a King of <HI>Great Britain?</HI> I might an&s;wer becau&s;e I had &s;een him; Or a King of <HI>Spain?</HI> becau&s;e I had &s;een tho&s;e who &s;aw him. But as for this King of Kings, I neither &s;aw him my&s;elf, nor any one el&s;e that ever did &s;ee him. Surely if there be &s;uch a Thing as God, it is very &s;trange, that he &s;hou'd leave him&s;elf without a Wit|ne&s;s; that Men &s;hou'd &s;till di&s;pute his Being; and that there &s;hou'd be no one evident, &s;en&s;ible, plain Proof of it without recour&s;e to Philo&s;ophy or Meta|phy&s;ics. A Matter of Fact is not to be proved by Notions, but by Facts. This is clear and full to the Point. You &s;ee what I wou'd be at. Upon the&s;e Principles I defy Super&s;tition. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You be|lieve then as far as you can &s;ee. <HI>ALC.</HI> That is my Rule of Faith. <HI>EUPH.</HI> How! will you not be|lieve the Exi&s;tence of Things which you hear, un|le&s;s you al&s;o &s;ee them? <HI>ALC.</HI> I will not &s;ay &s;o nei|ther. When I in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing I wou'd be under|&s;tood to mean perceiving in general: Outward Ob|jects make very different Impre&s;&s;ions upon the ani|mal Spirits, all which are compri&s;ed under the com|mon Name of Sen&s;e.

<P><HI>EUPH.</HI> The Soul of Man actuates but a &s;mall Body, an in&s;ignificant Particle, in re&s;pect of the great Ma&s;&s;es of Nature, the Elements, and hea|venly Bodies, and Sy&s;tem of the World. And the Wi&s;dom that appears in tho&s;e Motions, which are the Effect of Human Rea&s;on, is incomparably le&s;s than that which di&s;covers it &s;elf, in the &s;tructure and u&s;e of organized natural Bodies, Animal or Vegeta|ble.

But on the other hand, if the point was &s;o clear as you pretend, I cannot conceive how &s;o many &s;agacious Men of our Sect &s;hou'd be &s;o much in the dark, as not to know or believe one Syl|lable of it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Alciphron,</HI> it is not our pre|&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to account for the Over&s;ights, or vindi|cate the Honour of tho&s;e great Men the Free-think|ers, when their very Exi&s;tence is in danger of being called in que&s;tion. <HI>ALC.</HI> How &s;o? <HI>EUPH.</HI> Be plea&s;ed to recollect the Conce&s;&s;ions you have made, and then &s;hew me, if the Arguments for a Deity be not conclu&s;ive, by what better Argument you can prove the Exi&s;tence of that thinking Thing, which in &s;trictne&s;s con&s;titutes the Free-thinker. As &s;oon as <HI>Euphranor</HI> had uttered the&s;e Words, <HI>Alciphron</HI> &s;topt &s;hort and &s;tood in a po&s;ture of Meditation, while the re&s;t of us continued our walk and took two or three turns, after which he joined us again with a &s;miling Countenance, like one who had made &s;ome Di&s;cove|ry. I have found, &s;aid he, what may clear up the point in di&s;pute, and give <HI>Euphranor</HI> intire &s;atisfacti|on; I wou'd &s;ay an Argument which will prove the Exi&s;tence of a Free-thinker, the like where|of cannot be applied to prove the Exi&s;tence of a God. You mu&s;t know then, that your Notion of our perceiving the Exi&s;tence of God, as cer|tainly and immediately as we do that of a Human Per&s;on, I cou'd by no means dige&s;t, though I mu&s;t own it puzzled me, till I had con&s;idered the matter. At fir&s;t methought, a particular Structure, Shape, or Motion was the mo&s;t certain Proof of a thinking, rea&s;onable Soul. But a little attention &s;atisfied me, that the&s;e things have no nece&s;&s;ary Connexion with Rea&s;on, Knowledge, and Wi&s;dom. And that al|lowing them to be certain Proofs of a living Soul,
<PB N="138" REF="149">
they cannot be &s;o of a thinking and rea&s;onable one. Upon &s;econd Thoughts, therefore, and a minute Exa|mination of this point, I have found that nothing &s;o much convinces me of the Exi&s;tence of another Per|&s;on as his &s;peaking to me. It is my hearing you talk that, in &s;trict and philo&s;ophical Truth, is to me the be&s;t Argument for your Being. And this is a pecu|liar Argument inapplicable to your purpo&s;e: for you will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, pretend that God &s;peaks to Man in the &s;ame clear and &s;en&s;ible manner, as one Man doth to another.</P>

Men learn this Language? To acquire the know|ledge of &s;o many Signs, as go to the making up a Language, is a work of &s;ome difficulty.

If we have been all practi&s;ing this Language, ever &s;ince our fir&s;t entrance into the World: If the Author of Nature con&s;tantly &s;peaks to the Eyes of all Mankind, even in their earlie&s;t Infancy, whenever the Eyes are open in the Light, whether alone or in Company: It doth not &s;eem to me at all &s;trange, that Men &s;hou'd not be aware they had ever learned a Language, begun &s;o early, and practi&s;ed &s;o con&s;tant|ly, as this of Vi&s;ion.

<P>It may be al&s;o worth while to ob&s;erve, that Signs being little con&s;idered in them&s;elves, or for their own &s;ake, but only in their relative Capacity, and for the &s;ake of tho&s;e things whereof they are Signs, it comes to pa&s;s, that the mind often over|looks them, &s;o as to carry its Attention immediately on to the things &s;ignified. Thus, for example, in read|ing we run over the Characters with the &s;lighte&s;t re|gard, and pa&s;s on to the meaning. Hence it is fre|quent for Men to &s;ay, they &s;ee Words, and Notions, and Things in reading of a Book; whereas in &s;trict|ne&s;s,
<PB N="146" REF="157">
they &s;ee only the Characters, which &s;ugge&s;t Words, Nations, and Things. And by parity of Rea&s;on, may we not &s;uppo&s;e, that Men, not re&s;ting in, but overlooking, the immediate and proper Ob|jects of Sight, as in their own Nature of &s;mall mo|ment, carry their Attention onward to the very things &s;ignified, and talk as if they &s;aw the &s;econdary Ob|jects? which, in truth and &s;trictne&s;s, are not &s;een but only &s;ugge&s;ted and apprehended by means of the proper Objects of Sight, which alone are &s;een. <HI>ALC.</HI> To &s;peak my mind freely, this Di&s;&s;ertation grows te|dious, and runs into points too dry and minute for a Gentleman's Attention. I thought &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> we had been told, the Minute Philo&s;ophers loved to con&s;ider things clo&s;ely and minutely. <HI>ALC.</HI> That is true, but in &s;o polite an Age who wou'd be a meer Philo&s;o|pher? There is a certain &s;chola&s;tic Accuracy which ill &s;uits the freedom and ca&s;e of a well-bred Man. But, to cut &s;hort this Chicane, I propound it fairly to your own Con&s;cience, whether you really think, that God him&s;elf &s;peaks every day and in every place to the Eyes of all Men? <HI>EUPH.</HI> That is really and in truth my Opinion; and it &s;hou'd be yours too, if you are con&s;i&s;tent with your &s;elf, and abide by your own Definition of Language. Since you cannot deny, that the Great Mover and Author of Nature con|&s;tantly explaineth him&s;elf to the Eyes of Men, by the &s;en&s;ible intervention of arbitrary Signs, which have no Similitude or Connexion with the things &s;ig|nified; &s;o as by compounding and di&s;po&s;ing them, to &s;ugge&s;t and exhibit an endle&s;s variety of Objects dif|fering in nature, time, and place, thereby informing and directing Men, how to act with re&s;pect to things di&s;tant and future, as well as near and pre&s;ent. In con&s;equence, I &s;ay, of your own Sentiments and Con|ce&s;&s;ions, you have as much rea&s;on to think, the uni|ver&s;al Agent or God &s;peaks to your Eyes, as you can have for thinking any particular Per&s;on &s;peaks to your Ears. <HI>ALC.</HI> I cannot help thinking, that &s;ome

Upon which Words of <HI>Alciphron,</HI> I, who had acted the part of an indifferent &s;tander-by, ob&s;erved to him, that it misbecame his Character and repeated Profe&s;|&s;ions, to own an Attachment to the Judgment, or build upon the pre&s;umed Abilities of other Men how ingenious &s;oever: and that this proceeding might en|courage his Adver&s;aries to have recour&s;e to Authori|ty, in which perhaps they wou'd find their account more than he. Oh! &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> I have often ob&s;erv|ed the Conduct of Minute Philo&s;ophers. When one

of them has got a ring of Di&s;ciples round him, his method is to exclaim again&s;t Prejudice, and recom|mend thinking and rea&s;oning, giving to under&s;tand that him&s;elf is a Man of deep Re&s;earches and clo&s;e Argument, one who examines impartially and con|cludes warily. The &s;ame Man in other Company, if he chance to be pre&s;&s;ed with Rea&s;on, &s;hall laugh at Logic and a&s;&s;ume the lazy &s;upine Airs of a fine Gen|tleman, a Wit, a Railleur, to avoid the dryne&s;s of a regular and exact Inquiry. This double Face of the Minute Philo&s;opher is of no &s;mall u&s;e to propagate and maintain his Notions. Though to me it &s;eems a plain Ca&s;e, that if a fine Gentleman will &s;hake off Authority, and appeal from Religion to Rea&s;on, un|to Rea&s;on he mu&s;t go: And if he cannot go without leading &s;trings, &s;urely he had better be led by the Au|thority of the Public, than by that of any knot of Minute Philo&s;ophers. <HI>ALC.</HI> Gentlemen, this Di&s;|cour&s;e is very irk&s;ome and needle&s;s.

<P>You it &s;eems &s;tare to find, that God is not far from every one of us, and that in him we live and move and have our Being. You, who in the begin|ning of this Morning's Conference, thought it &s;trange, that God &s;hou'd leave him&s;elf without a witne&s;s, do now think it &s;trange the witne&s;s &s;hou'd be &s;o full and clear. <HI>ALC.</HI> I mu&s;t own I do. I was aware, indeed, of a certain Metaphy&s;ical Hypothe|&s;is, of our &s;eeing all things in God by the union of the Humane Soul with the intelligible Sub&s;tance of the Deity, which neither I nor any one el&s;e cou'd
<PB N="149" REF="160">
make &s;en&s;e of. But I never imagined it cou'd be pre|tended, that we &s;aw God with our fle&s;hly Eyes as plain as we &s;ee any Human Per&s;on what&s;oever, and that he daily &s;peaks to our Sen&s;es in a manife&s;t and clear Dialect. <HI>CRI.</HI> This Language hath a nece&s;|&s;ary Connexion with Knowledge, Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s. It is equivalent to a con&s;tant Creation, be|tokening an immediate act of Power and Providence. It cannot be accounted for by mechanical Principles, by Atoms, Attractions, or Effluvia. The in&s;tanta|neous Production and Reproduction of &s;o many Signs combined, di&s;&s;olved, tran&s;po&s;ed, diver&s;ified, and adapted to &s;uch an endle&s;s variety of purpo&s;es, ever &s;hifting with the occa&s;ions and &s;uited to them, being utterly inexplicable and unaccountable by the Laws of Motion, by Chance, by Fate, or the like blind Principles, doth &s;et forth and te&s;tify the immediate Operation of a Spirit or thinking Being; and not meerly of a Spirit, which every Motion or Gravita|tion may po&s;&s;ibly infer, but of one wi&s;e, good and provident Spirit, who directs and rules and governs the World. Some Philo&s;ophers, being convinced of the Wi&s;dom and Power of the Creator, from the make and contrivance of organized Bodies and or|derly Sy&s;tem of the World, did neverthele&s;s imagine, that he left this Sy&s;tem with all its parts and contents well adju&s;ted and put in motion, as an Arti&s;t leaves a Clock, to go thenceforward of it &s;elf for a certain Period. But this vi&s;ual Language proves, not a Cre|ator meerly, but a provident Governor actually and intimately pre&s;ent and attentive to all our Intere&s;ts and Motions; who watches over our Conduct, and takes care of our minute&s;t Actions and De&s;igns, throughout the whole cour&s;e of our lives, informing, admoni&s;hing, and directing ince&s;&s;antly, in a mo&s;t e|vident e|vident and &s;en&s;ible manner. This is truly wonderful. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And is it not &s;o, that Men &s;hou'd be en|compa&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a wonder, without reflecting on it?</P>

<P>Something there is of Divine and Admirable in this Language, addre&s;&s;ed to our Eyes, that may well a waken the Mind, and de&s;erve its utmo&s;t Atten|tion; it is learned with &s;o little pains, it expre&s;&s;eth the Differences of Things &s;o clearly and aptly, it in|&s;tructs with &s;uch Facility and Di&s;patch, by one Glance of the Eye conveying a greater Variety of Advices, and a more di&s;tinct Knowledge of Things, than cou'd be got by a Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;everal Hours. And, while it informs, it amu&s;es and entertains the Mind with &s;uch &s;ingular Plea&s;ure and Delight. It is of &s;uch excellent U&s;e in giving a Stability and Permanen|cy to Humane Di&s;cour&s;e, in recording Sounds and be|&s;towing Life on dead Languages, enabling us to con|ver&s;e with Men of remote Ages and Countries. And it an&s;wers &s;o appo&s;ite to the U&s;es and Nece&s;&s;ities of Man|kind, informing us more di&s;tinctly of tho&s;e Objects, who&s;e Nearne&s;s and Magnitude qualify them to be of greate&s;t Detriment or Benefit to our Bodies, and le&s;s exactly, in Proportion as their Littlene&s;s or Di&s;tance make them of le&s;s Concern to us. <HI>ALC.</HI> And yet the&s;e &s;trange Things affect Men but little. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But they are not &s;trange, they are familiar, and that makes them be overlooked. Things which rarely happen &s;trike; whereas Frequency le&s;&s;ens the Admiration of Things, though in them&s;elves ever &s;o admirable. Hence a common Man, who is not u&s;ed to think and make Reflexions, wou'd probably be more convin|ced of the Being of a God, by one &s;ingle Sentence heard once in his life from the Sky, than by all the Experience he has had of this vi&s;ual Language, con|trived with &s;uch exqui&s;ite skill, &s;o con&s;tantly ad|dre&s;&s;ed to his Eyes, and &s;o plainly declaring the Near|ne&s;s, Wi&s;dom, and Providence of him with whom we have to do. <HI>ALC.</HI> After all, I cannot &s;ati&s;|fy my &s;elf, how Men &s;hou'd be &s;o little &s;urpri&s;ed or amazed about this vi&s;ive Faculty, if it was really of a nature &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing and amazing. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But

The great Point
<PB N="153" REF="164">
is what Sen&s;e the word God is to be taken in. The very <HI>Epicureans</HI> allowed the Being of Gods; but then they were indolent Gods, unconcerned with Human Affairs. <HI>Hobbes</HI> allowed a corporeal God; and <HI>Spino&s;a</HI> held the Univer&s;e to be God. And yet no body doubts they were &s;taunch Free-thinkers. I cou'd wi&s;h indeed the word God were quite omitted, be|cau&s;e in mo&s;t minds it is coupled with a &s;ort of &s;u|per&s;titious Aw, the very Root of all Religion. I &s;hall not, neverthele&s;s, be much di&s;turbed though the name be retained, and the Being of God allowed in any Sen&s;e but in that of a Mind, which knows all things, and beholds Human Actions, like &s;ome Judge or Magi&s;trate with infinite Ob&s;ervation and Intelli|gence. The Belief of a God in this Sen&s;e fills a Man's Mind with Scruples, lays him under Con|&s;traints and imbitters his very Being: But in another Sen&s;e, it may be attended with no great ill Con&s;e|quence. This I know was the Opinion of our great <HI>Diagoras,</HI> who told me he wou'd never have been at the pains, to find out a Demon&s;tration that there was no God, if the received Notion of God had been the &s;ame with that of &s;ome Fathers and Schoolmen. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Pray what was that?</P>

<P><HI>LYS.</HI> You mu&s;t know, <HI>Diagoras,</HI> a Man of much reading and inquiry, had di&s;covered that once upon a time, the mo&s;t profound and &s;peculative Divines finding it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the Attri|butes of God, taken in the common Sen&s;e, or in any known Sen&s;e, with Human Rea&s;on, and the Appear|ances of things, taught that the words Knowledge, Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, and &s;uch like, when &s;poken of the Deity, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a quite different Sen&s;e, from what they &s;ignify in the vulgar Accepta|tion, or from any thing that we can form a Notion of, or conceive. Hence, whatever Objections might be made again&s;t the Attributes of God they ea&s;ily
<PB N="154" REF="165">
&s;olved, by denying tho&s;e Attributes belonged to God, in this or that or any known particular Sen&s;e or No|tion; which was the &s;ame thing as to deny they be|longed to him at all. And thus denying the Attri|butes of God they in effect deny'd his Being, though perhaps they were not aware of it. Suppo&s;e, for in|&s;tance, a Man &s;hou'd object, that future Contin|gencies were incon&s;i&s;tent with the Fore-knowledge of God, becau&s;e it is repugnant that certain Know|ledge &s;hou'd be of an uncertain thing: it was a rea|dy and an ea&s;y an&s;wer to &s;ay, that this may be true, with re&s;pect to Knowledge taken in the common Sen&s;e, or in any Sen&s;e that we can po&s;&s;ibly form any Notion of; but that there wou'd not appear the &s;ame Incon&s;i&s;tency, between the contingent Nature of Things and Divine Foreknowledge, taken to &s;ignify &s;omewhat that we know nothing of, which in God &s;upplies the place of what we under&s;tand by Know|ledge; from which it differs not in Quantity or De|gree of Perfection, but altogether, and in kind, as Light doth from Sound; and even more, &s;ince the&s;e agree in that they are both Sen&s;ations: whereas Knowledge in God hath no &s;ort of Re&s;emblance or Agreement with any Notion, that Man can frame of Knowledge. The like may be &s;aid of all the other Attributes, which indeed may by this means be e|qually reconciled with every thing or with nothing: But all Men who think mu&s;t needs &s;ee, this is cutting knots and not untying them. For how are things re|conciled with the Divine Attributes, when the&s;e At|tributes them&s;elves are in every intelligible Sen&s;e de|nied; and con&s;equently the very Notion of God ta|ken away, and nothing left but the Name, without any meaning annexed to it? In &s;hort, the Belief that there is an unknown Subject of Attributes ab&s;olutely unknown is a very innocent Doctrine; which the acute <HI>Diagoras</HI> well &s;aw, and was therefore wonder|fully delighted with this Sy&s;tem.</P>

<P>For, &s;aid he, if this cou'd once make its way and obtain in the World, there wou'd be an end of all natural or rational Religion, which is the Ba|&s;is both of the Jewi&s;h and the Chri&s;tian: for he who comes to God, or enters him&s;elf in the Church of God, mu&s;t fir&s;t believe that there is a God in &s;ome intelligible Sen&s;e; and not only that there is &s;ome|thing in general without any proper Notion, though never &s;o inadequate, of any of its Qualities or Attri|butes; for this may be Fate, or Chaos, or Pla&s;tic Na|ture, or any thing el&s;e as well as God. Nor will it avail to &s;ay, there is &s;omething in this unknown Be|ing analogous to Knowledge and Goodne&s;s; that is to &s;ay, which produceth tho&s;e Effects, which we cou'd not conceive to be produced by Men in any De|gree, without Knowledge and Goodne&s;s. For this is in Fact to give up the Point in di&s;pute between Thei&s;ts and Athei&s;ts, the Que&s;tion having always been, not whether there was a Principle, (which Point was allowed by all Philo&s;ophers as well before as &s;ince <HI>Anaxagoras)</HI> but whether this Principle was a <GAP DESC="foreign">, a thinking intelligent Being: That is to &s;ay, whether that Order and Beauty and U&s;e, vi&s;ible in Natural Effects, cou'd be produced by any thing but a Mind or Intelligence, in the proper Sen&s;e of the Word; and whether there mu&s;t not be true, real, and proper Knowledge in the fir&s;t Cau&s;e. We will therefore acknowledge, that all tho&s;e natural Effects which are vulgarly a&s;cribed to Knowledge and Wi&s;|dom, proceed from a Being in which there is, proper|ly &s;peaking, no Knowledge or Wi&s;dom at all, but only &s;omething el&s;e, which, in reality, is the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e things which Men, for want of knowing better, a&s;cribe to what they call Knowledge and Wi&s;|dom and Under&s;tanding. You wonder perhaps to hear a Man of Plea&s;ure, who diverts him&s;elf as I do, philo&s;ophize at this rate. But you &s;hou'd con&s;ider that much is to be got by conver&s;ing with ingenious
<PB N="156" REF="167">
Men, which is a &s;hort way to Knowledge, that &s;aves a Man the drudgery of Reading and Thinking. And now we have granted to you that there is a God in this indefinite Sen&s;e, I wou'd fain &s;ee what u&s;e you can make of this Conce&s;&s;ion. You cannot argue from unknown Attributes, or which is the &s;ame thing, from Attributes in an unknown Sen&s;e. You cannot prove, that God is to be loved for his Good|ne&s;s, or feared for his Ju&s;tice, or re&s;pected for his Knowledge: All which Con&s;equences, we own, wou'd follow from tho&s;e Attributes admitted in an intelligible Sen&s;e. But we deny, that tho&s;e or any other Con&s;equences can be drawn from Attributes ad|mitted in no particular Sen&s;e, or in a Sen&s;e which none of us under&s;tand. Since therefore nothing can be inferred from &s;uch an Account of God, about Con&s;cience, or Wor&s;hip, or Religion, you may e'en make the be&s;t of it; and, not to be &s;ingular, we will u&s;e the Name too, and &s;o at once there is an end of A|thei&s;m. <HI>EUPH.</HI> This Account of a Deity is new to me.

<P><HI>CRI.</HI> It is not new to me. I remember not long &s;ince to have heard a Minute Philo&s;opher triumph upon this very Point; which put me on in|quiring what Foundation there was for it in the Fa|thers or Schoolmen. And, for ought that I can find, it owes its Original to tho&s;e Writings, which have been publi&s;hed under the Name of <HI>Diony&s;ius the Areopagite.</HI> The Author of which, it mu&s;t be own|ed, hath written upon the Divine Attributes in a very &s;ingular Style. In his Treati&s;e of the Coele&s;tial Hie|rarchy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Hierarch.

all Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding, <GAP DESC="foreign">, ineffable and innominable, <GAP DESC="foreign">; the Wi&s;|dom of God he terms an unrea&s;onable, unintelligent, and fooli&s;h Wi&s;dom; <GAP DESC="foreign">. But then the Rea&s;on he gives, for expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in this &s;trange manner, is, that the Divine Wi&s;dom is the Cau&s;e of all Rea&s;on, Wi&s;dom, and Under&s;tand|ing, and therein are contained the Trea&s;ures of all Wi&s;dom and Knowledge. He calls God <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">; as if Wi&s;dom and Life were Words not wor|thy to expre&s;s the Divine Perfections: And he adds, that the Attributes unintelligent and unperceiving mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the Divinity, not <GAP DESC="foreign"> by way of Defect, but <GAP DESC="foreign"> by way of Eminency; which he explains by our giving the Name of Dark|ne&s;s to Light inacce&s;&s;ible. And, notwith&s;tanding the Har&s;hne&s;s of his Expre&s;&s;ions in &s;ome Places, he affirms over and over in others, that God knows all Things; not that he is beholden to the Creatures for his Knowledge, but by knowing him&s;elf, from whom they all derive their Being, and in whom they are contained as in their Cau&s;e. It was late before the&s;e Writings appear to have been known in the World; and although they obtained Credit during the Age of the Schoolmen, yet &s;ince critical Learning hath been cultivated, they have lo&s;t that Credit, and are at this Day given up for &s;purious, as containing &s;everal evi|dent Marks of a much later Date than the Age of <HI>Diony&s;ius.</HI> Upon the whole, although this Method of growing in Expre&s;&s;ion, and dwindling in Notion, of clearing up Doubts by Non&s;en&s;e, and avoiding Difficulties by running into affected Contradictions, may perhaps proceed from a well-meant Zeal; yet it appears not to be according to Knowledge, and in|&s;tead of reconciling Athei&s;ts to the Truth, hath, I doubt, a Tendency to confirm them in their own Per&s;ua&s;ion. It &s;hou'd &s;eem, therefore, very weak and ra&s;h in a Chri&s;tian to adopt this har&s;h Language of an Apocryphal Writer, preferably to that of the
<PB N="158" REF="169">
Holy Scriptures. I remember, indeed, to have read of a certain Philo&s;opher, who lived &s;ome Centuries ago, that u&s;ed to &s;ay, if the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Works of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> had been known to the Primitive Fathers, they wou'd have furni&s;hed them admirable Weapons again&s;t the Hereticks, and wou'd have &s;aved a world of Pains. But the Event &s;ince their Di&s;covery hath by no means confirmed his Opinion. It mu&s;t be owned, the celebrated <HI>Picus</HI> of <HI>Mirandula,</HI> among his Nine Hundred Conclu&s;ions (which that Prince, being very young, propo&s;ed to maintain by public Di&s;putation at <HI>Rome)</HI> hath this for one; to wit, that it is more improper to &s;ay of God, he is an Intellect or intelligent Being, than to &s;ay of a rea&s;onable Soul that it is an Angel: Which Doctrine it &s;eems was not reli&s;hed. And <HI>Picus,</HI> when he comes to defend it, &s;upports him&s;elf altogether by the Example and Authority of <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> and in effect explains it away into a meer verbal Difference, affirming, that neither <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> nor him&s;elf ever meant to deprive God of Knowledge, or to deny that he knows all Things: But that, as Rea&s;on is of kind peculiar to Man, &s;o by Intellection he under&s;tands a kind or manner of Knowing peculiar to Angels: And that the Know|ledge, which is in God, is more above the Intellecti|on of Angels, than Angel is above Man. He adds that, as his Tenet con&s;i&s;ts with admitting the mo&s;t perfect Knowledge in God, &s;o he wou'd by no means be under&s;tood to exclude from the Deity Intellection it &s;elf, taken in the common or general Sen&s;e, but only that peculiar &s;ort of Intellection proper to An|gels, which he thinks ought not to be attributed to God any more than Human Rea&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pic. Mirand. in Apolog. p. 155. Ed.

<P><HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> expre&s;&s;eth his Sen&s;e of this Point in the following manner. All Perfections, &s;aith he, derived from God to the Creatures are in a certain higher Sen&s;e, or (as the Schoolmen term it) eminently in God. Whenever, therefore, a Name borrowed from any Perfection in the Creature is at|tributed to God, we mu&s;t exclude from its Significa|tion every thing that belongs to the imperfect Man|ner, wherein that Attribute is found in the Creature. Whence he concludes, that Knowledge in God is not an Habit, but a pure Act <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sum. Theolog. p. 1. Que&s;t. 14. Art. 1.</NOTE>. And again the &s;ame Doctor ob&s;erves, that our Intellect gets its Notions of all &s;orts of Perfections from the Creatures, and that as it apprehends tho&s;e Perfections, &s;o it &s;igni|fies them by Names. Therefore, &s;aith he, in at|tributing the&s;e Names to God, we are to con&s;ider two Things; fir&s;t, The Perfections them&s;elves as Goodne&s;s, Life, and the like, which are properly in God; and, &s;econdly, The Manner which is pecu|liar to the Creature, and cannot, &s;trictly and proper|ly &s;peaking, be &s;aid to agree to the Creator <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Que&s;t. 13. Art. 3.</NOTE>. And although <HI>Suarez,</HI> with other Schoolmen, teacheth, that the Mind of Man conceiveth Knowledge and Will to be in God as Faculties or Operations, by A|nalogy only to created Beings; yet he gives it plainly as his Opinion, that when Knowledge is &s;aid not to be properly in God, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a Sen&s;e in|cluding
<PB N="160" REF="171">
Imperfection, &s;uch as di&s;cur&s;ive Knowledge, or the like imperfect kind found in the Creatures: And that, none of tho&s;e Imperfections in the Knowledge of Men or Angels belonging to the formal Notion of Knowledge, or to Knowledge as &s;uch, it will not thence follow that Knowledge, in its proper formal Sen&s;e, may not be attributed to God: And of Know|ledge taken in general for the clear evident under&s;tan|ding of all Truth, he expre&s;ly affirms that it is in God, and that this was never denied by any Philo&s;o|pher who believed a God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suarez Di&s;p. Metaph. Tom. 2. Di&s;p. 30. Sect. 15.</NOTE>. It was, indeed, a cur|rent Opinion in the Schools, that even Being it&s;elf &s;hou'd be attributed analogically to God and the Creatures. That is, they held that God, the &s;u|preme, independent, &s;elf-originate Cau&s;e and Source of all Beings, mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in the &s;ame Sen&s;e with created Beings, not that he exi&s;ts le&s;s truly, properly, or formally than they, but only be|cau&s;e he exi&s;ts in a more eminent and perfect Manner.</P>

<P>But to prevent any Man's being led, by mi&s;|taking the Schola&s;tic U&s;e of the Terms <HI>Analogy</HI> and <HI>Analogical,</HI> into an Opinion that we cannot frame in any Degree, a true and proper Notion of Attributes applied by Analogy, or, in the School Phra&s;e, pre|dicated analogically, it may not be ami&s;s to inquire in|to the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of tho&s;e Words. Every one knows, that Analogy is a <HI>Greek</HI> Word u&s;ed by Mathematicians, to &s;ignify a Similitude of Proportions. For In&s;tance, when we ob&s;erve that Two is to Six, as Three is to Nine, this Similitude or Equality of Proportion is termed Analogy. And although Proportion &s;trictly &s;ignifies the Habitude or Relation of one Quantity to another, yet, in a loo&s;er and tran&s;lated Sen&s;e, it hath been applied to &s;ignify every other Habitude; and con&s;equently the Term Analogy comes to &s;ignify all Similitude of Re|lations,
<PB N="161" REF="172">
or Habitudes what&s;oever. Hence, the School|men tell us there is Analogy between Intellect and Sight; fora&s;much as Intellect is to the Mind, what Sight is to the Body? And that he who governs the State is analogous to him who &s;teers a Ship. Hence a Prince is analogically &s;tiled a Pilot, being to the State as a Pilot is to his Ve&s;&s;el <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Cajetan. de Nom. Analog. c. 3.</NOTE>. For the farther clearing of this Point it is to be ob&s;erved, that a two|fold Analogy is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Schoolmen, me|taphorical and proper. Of the fir&s;t Kind there are frequent In&s;tances in Holy Scripture, attributing Human Parts and Pa&s;&s;ions to God. When he is re|pre&s;ented as having a Finger, an Eye, or an Ear, when he is &s;aid to repent, to be angry, or grieved, every one &s;ees the Analogy is meerly metaphorical. Becau&s;e tho&s;e Parts and Pa&s;&s;ions, taken in the proper Signification, mu&s;t in every Degree nece&s;&s;arily, and from the formal Nature of the Thing, include Im|perfection. When therefore it is &s;aid, the Finger of God appears in this or that Event, Men of common Sen&s;e mean no more, but that it is as truly a&s;cribed to God, as the Works wrought by Human Fingers are to Man: and &s;o of the re&s;t. But the ca&s;e is different, when Wi&s;dom and Knowledge are attributed to God. Pa&s;&s;ions and Sen&s;es as &s;uch imply Defect; but in Knowledge &s;imply, or as &s;uch, there is no Defect. Knowledge therefore, in the proper formal meaning of the Word, may be attributed to God proportiona|bly, that is pre&s;erving a Proportion to the infinite Nature of God. We may &s;ay, therefore, that as God is infinitely above Man, &s;o is the Knowledge of God infinitely above the Knowledge of Man, and this is what <HI>Cajetan</HI> calls <HI>Analogia propri&egrave; facta.</HI> And after this &s;ame Analogy, we mu&s;t under&s;tand all tho&s;e Attributes to belong to the Deity, which in them|&s;elves &s;imply, and as &s;uch, denote Perfection. We
<PB N="162" REF="173">
may therefore con&s;i&s;tently with what hath been pre|mi&s;ed, affirm that all &s;orts of Perfection, which we can conceive in a finite Spirit, are in God, but with|out any of that allay which is found in the Creatures. This Doctrine therefore of Analogical Perfections in God, or our knowing God by Analogy, &s;eems very much mi&s;under&s;tood and mi&s;applied by tho&s;e who wou'd infer from thence, that we cannot frame any direct or proper Notion, though never &s;o inadequate, of Knowledge or Wi&s;dom, as they are in the Deity, or under&s;tand any more of them than one born blind can of Light and Colours.</P>

<P>And now, Gentlemen, it may be expected I &s;hou'd ask your Pardon, for having dwelt &s;o long on a point of Metaphy&s;ics, and introduced &s;uch un|poli&s;hed and unfa&s;hionable Writers as the Schoolmen into good Company: but as <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> gave the occa&s;i|on, I leave him to an&s;wer for it. <HI>LYS.</HI> I never dreamt of this dry Di&s;&s;ertation. But, if I have been the occa&s;ion of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the&s;e Schola&s;tic Points, by my unluckily mentioning the Schoolmen, it was my fir&s;t fault of the kind, and I promi&s;e it &s;hall be the la&s;t. The meddling with crabbed Authors of any &s;ort is none of my ta&s;te. I grant one meets now and then with a good Notion in what we call dry Wri|ters, &s;uch an one for example as this I was &s;peaking of, which I mu&s;t own &s;truck my Fancy. But then for the&s;e we have &s;uch as <HI>Prodicus</HI> or <HI>Diagoras,</HI> who look into ob&s;olete Books, and &s;ave the re&s;t of us that trou|ble. <HI>CRI.</HI> So you pin your Faith upon them. <HI>LYS.</HI> It is only for &s;ome odd Opinions, and matters of Fact, and critical Points. Be&s;ides, we know the Men to whom we give credit: They are judicious and hone&s;t, and have no end to &s;erve but Truth. And I am confident &s;ome Author or other has maintained the forementioned Notion in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as <HI>Dia|goras</HI> related it. <HI>CRI.</HI> That may be. But it never was a received Notion, and never will, &s;o long as

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> And yet I am not without my Scruples: For with Knowledge you infer Wi&s;dom, and with Wi&s;dom Goodne&s;s. But how is it po&s;&s;ible, to conceive God &s;o good, and Man &s;o wicked? It may perhaps with &s;ome Colour be alledged, that a little &s;oft &s;hadowing of Evil &s;ets off the bright and luminous parts of the Creation, and &s;o contributes to the Beauty of the whole Piece: But, for Blots &s;o large and &s;o black it is impo&s;&s;ible to account by that Principle. That there &s;hou'd be &s;o much Vice and &s;o little Virtue upon Earth, and that the Laws of God's Kingdom &s;hou'd be &s;o ill ob&s;erved by his Sub|jects, is what can never be reconciled with that &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the &s;upreme Mo|narch. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> wou'd you argue that a State was ill admini&s;tred, or judge of the manners of its Citizens, by the Di&s;orders com|mitted in the Goal or Dungeon? <HI>ALC.</HI> I wou'd not. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And for ought we know, this Spot with the few Sinners on it, bears no greater Propor|tion to the Univer&s;e of Intelligences, than a Dun|geon doth to a Kingdom.

<P><HI>CRI.</HI> To me it &s;eems natural, that &s;uch a weak pa&s;&s;ionate and &s;hort-&s;ighted Creature as Man, &s;hou'd be ever liable to Scruples of one kind or o|ther. But, as this &s;ame Creature is apt to be over po&s;itive in judging, and over ha&s;ty in concluding, it falls out, that the&s;e Difficulties and Scruples about God's Conduct are made Objections to his Being.

One of them, a Man of a choleric and vindictive Spirit, &s;aid he cou'd not believe a Providence, becau&s;e <HI>London</HI> was not &s;wallowed up or con&s;umed by Fire from Heaven, the Streets being as he &s;aid full of People, who &s;hew no other Belief or Wor&s;hip of God, but perpetually praying that he wou'd damn, rot, &s;ink, and confound them. The other, being of an indolent and ea&s;y Temper, concluded there cou'd be no &s;uch thing as a Providence, for that a Being of con&s;ummate Wi&s;|dom mu&s;t needs employ him&s;elf better, than in mind|ing the Prayers, and Actions, and little Intere&s;ts of Mankind. <HI>ALC.</HI> After all, if God have no Pa&s;&s;i|ons, how can it be true that Vengeance is his?

<P>WE amu&s;ed our&s;elves next Day every one to his Fancy, till Nine of the Clock, when Word was brought that the Tea-table was &s;et in the Library, which is a Gallery on a Ground-floor, with an arch|ed Door at one End opening into a Walk of Limes; where, as &s;oon as we had drank Tea, we were tempt|ed by fine Weather to take a Walk which led us to a &s;mall Mount of ea&s;y A&s;cent, on the Top whereof we found a Seat under a &s;preading Tree. Here we had a Pro&s;pect on one hand of a narrow Bay or Creek of the Sea, inclo&s;ed on either Side by a Coa&s;t beautified with Rocks and Woods, and green Banks and Farm-hou&s;es. At the End of the Bay was a &s;mall Town placed upon the Slope of a Hill, which from the Ad|vantage of its Situation made a con&s;iderable Figure. Several Fi&s;hing-boats and Lighters gliding up and down on a Surface as &s;mooth and bright as Gla&s;s en|livened the Pro&s;pect. On the other Side we looked down on green Pa&s;tures, Flocks, and Herds, basking beneath in Sun-&s;hine, while we in our &s;uperior Situ|ation enjoy'd the Fre&s;hne&s;s of Air and Shade. Here we felt that &s;ort of joyful In&s;tinct which a rural Scene and fine Weather in&s;pire; and propo&s;ed no &s;mall Plea|&s;ure, in re&s;uming and continuing our Conference without Interruption till Dinner: But we had hard|ly &s;eated our&s;elves, and looked about us, when we &s;aw a Fox run by the Foot of our Mount into an ad|jacent Thicket. A few Minutes after, we heard a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e of the opening of Hounds, the winding of Horns, and the roaring of Country Squires. While our Attention was &s;u&s;pended by this

Event, a Servant came running out of Breath and told <HI>Crito,</HI> that his Neighbour <HI>Cte&s;ippus,</HI> a Squire of Note, was fallen from his Hor&s;e attempting to leap over a Hedge, and brought into the Hall, where he lay for dead. Upon which we all ro&s;e and walked ha&s;tily to the Hou&s;e, where we found <HI>Cte&s;ippus</HI> ju&s;t come to him&s;elf, in the mid&s;t of half a dozen Sun-burnt Squires in Frocks and &s;hort Wigs and Jockey-Boots. Being asked how he did? he an&s;wered it was only a broken Rib. With &s;ome Difficulty <HI>Crito</HI> per|&s;uaded him to lie on a Bed till the Chirurgeon came. The&s;e Fox-hunters, having been up early at their Sport, were eager for Dinner, which was according|ly ha&s;tened. They pa&s;&s;ed the Afternoon in a loud ru&s;tic Mirth, gave Proof of their Religion and Loy|alty by the Healths they drank, talked of Hounds and Hor&s;es and Elections and Country Affairs till the Chi|rurgeon, who had been employed about <HI>Cte&s;ippus,</HI> de|&s;ired he might be put into <HI>Crito</HI>'s Coach, and &s;ent home, having refu&s;ed to &s;tay all Night.

Such, &s;aid he, were the <HI>Druids</HI> of old, and I &s;hou'd be glad to &s;ee them once more e&s;tabli&s;hed among us. <HI>CRI.</HI> How wou'd you like, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> that Prie&s;ts &s;hou'd have Power to decide all Controver&s;ies, adjudge Pro|perty, di&s;tribute Rewards and Puni&s;hments; that all who did not acquie&s;ce in their Decrees &s;hou'd be ex|communicated, held in Abhorrence, excluded from all Honours and Privileges, and deprived of the com|mon Benefit of the Laws; and that now and then, a Number of Lay-men &s;hou'd be crammed together in a Wicker-idol, and burnt for an Offering to their Pa|gan Gods? How &s;hou'd you like living under &s;uch
<PB N="171" REF="182">
Prie&s;ts and &s;uch a Religion? <HI>ALC.</HI> Not at all. Such a Situation wou'd by no means agree with Free-think|ers. <HI>CRI.</HI> And yet &s;uch were the <HI>Druids</HI> and &s;uch their Religion, if we may tru&s;t <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Account of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Bello Gallico, 1. 6.</NOTE>. <HI>LYS.</HI> I am now convinced more than ever, there ought to be no &s;uch Thing as an e&s;tabli&s;hed Re|ligion of any kind. Certainly all the Nations of the World have been hitherto out of their Wits. Even the <HI>Athenians</HI> them&s;elves, the wi&s;e&s;t and free&s;t People upon Earth, had, I know not what, fooli&s;h Attach|ment to their e&s;tabli&s;hed Church. They offered it &s;eems a Talent as a Reward to whoever &s;hou'd kill <HI>Diagoras</HI> the <HI>Melian,</HI> a Free-thinker of tho&s;e Times who derided their My&s;teries: And <HI>Protagoras,</HI> ano|ther of the &s;ame Turn, narrowly e&s;caped being put to Death, for having wrote &s;omething that &s;eemed to contradict their received Notions of the Gods. Such was the Treatment our generous Sect met with at <HI>Athens.</HI> And I make no doubt, but the&s;e <HI>Druids</HI> wou'd have &s;acrificed many a Holocau&s;t of Free-thinkers. I wou'd not give a &s;ingle Farthing to ex|change one Religion for another. Away with all together, Root and Branch, or you had as good do nothing. No <HI>Druids</HI> or Prie&s;ts of any &s;ort for me: I &s;ee no occa&s;ion for any of them.</P>

<P><HI>EUPH.</HI> What <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> &s;aith puts me in mind of the Clo&s;e of our la&s;t Conference, wherein it was agreed, in the following to re&s;ume the Point we were then entered upon, to wit, the U&s;e or Benefit of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which <HI>Alciphron</HI> expected <HI>Crito</HI> &s;hou'd make appear. <HI>CRI.</HI> I am the readier to un|dertake this Point, becau&s;e I conceive it to be no dif|ficult one, and that one great Mark of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity is, in my mind, its Tendency to do good, which &s;eems the North Star to conduct our Judgment
<PB N="172" REF="183">
in moral Matters, and in all Things of a practic Na|ture; Moral or practical Truths being ever connect|ed with univer&s;al Benefit. But to judge rightly of this Matter, we &s;hou'd endeavour to act like <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> upon another Occa&s;ion, taking into our View the Sum of Things, and con&s;idering Principles as branch|ed forth into Con&s;equences to the utmo&s;t Extent we are able. We are not &s;o much to regard the Humour or Caprice, or imaginary Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a few idle Men, who&s;e Conceit may be offended, though their Con|&s;cience cannot be wounded; but fairly to con&s;ider the true Intere&s;t of Individuals as well as of Human Society. Now the Chri&s;tian Religion, con&s;idered as a Fountain of Light, and Joy, and Peace, as a Source of Faith, and Hope, and Charity, (and that it is &s;o will be evident to whoever takes his Notion of it from the Go&s;pel) mu&s;t needs be a Principle of Hap|pine&s;s and Virtue. And he who &s;ees not, that the de|&s;troying the Principles of good Actions mu&s;t de|&s;troy good Actions, &s;ees nothing: And he who, &s;ee|ing this, &s;hall yet per&s;i&s;t to do it, if he be not wick|ed, who is?</P>

<P>To me it &s;eems the Man can &s;ee neither deep nor far, who is not &s;en&s;ible of his own Mi&s;ery, Sin|fulne&s;s, and Dependence; who doth not perceive, that this pre&s;ent World is not de&s;igned or adapted to make rational Souls happy; who wou'd not be glad of getting into a better State, and who wou'd not be overjoy'd to find, that the Road leading thither was the Love of God and Man, the practi&s;ing every Vir|tue, the living rea&s;onably while we are here upon Earth, proportioning our E&s;teem to the Value of Things, and &s;o u&s;ing this World as not to abu&s;e it, for this is what Chri&s;tianity requires. It neither in|joyns the Na&s;tine&s;s of the Cynic, nor the In&s;en&s;ibi|lity of the Stoic. Can there be a higher Ambition than to overcome the World, or a wi&s;er than to &s;ub|due our &s;elves, or a more comfortable Doctrine than
<PB N="173" REF="184">
the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, or a more joyful Pro&s;pect than that of having our ba&s;e Nature renewed and a&s;&s;imila|ted to the Deity, our being made Fellow-citizens with Angels and Sons of God? Did ever <HI>Pythagore|ans,</HI> or <HI>Platoni&s;ts,</HI> or Stoics, even in Idea or in Wi&s;h, propo&s;e to the Mind of Man purer Means or a nobler End? How great a Share of our Happine&s;s depends upon Hope! How totally is this extingui&s;hed by the Minute Philo&s;ophy! On the other hand, how is it cheri&s;hed and rai&s;ed by the Go&s;pel! Let any Man who thinks in earne&s;t but con&s;ider the&s;e Things, and then &s;ay which he thinks de&s;erveth be&s;t of Mankind, he who recommends, or he who runs down Chri&s;ti|anity?

He who aims at be|ing a Child of God, or He who is contented to be thought, and to be, one of <HI>Epicurus</HI>'s Hogs?

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> It is wonderful to ob&s;erve how Things change Appearance, as they are viewed in different Lights, or by different Eyes. The Picture, <HI>Crito,</HI> that I form of Religion is very unlike yours, when I con&s;ider how it unmans the Soul, filling it with ab|&s;urd Reveries and &s;lavi&s;h Fears; how it extingui&s;hes the gentle Pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;piring a Spirit of Malice, and Rage, and Per&s;ecution: When I behold bitter Re|&s;entments and unholy Wrath in tho&s;e very Men, who preach up Meekne&s;s and Charity to others. <HI>CRI.</HI> It is very po&s;&s;ible, that Gentlemen of your Sect may think Religion a Subject beneath their Attention; but yet it &s;eems that whoever lets up for oppo&s;ing any Doctrine, &s;hou'd know what it is he di&s;putes again&s;t.
<PB N="174" REF="185">
Know then, that Religion is the virtuous Mean be|tween Incredulity and Super&s;tition. We do not there|fore contend for &s;uper&s;titious Follies, or for the Rage of Bigots. What we plead for is Religion again&s;t Profanene&s;s, Law again&s;t Confu&s;ion, Virtue again&s;t Vice, the Hope of a Chri&s;tian again&s;t the De&s;pon|dency of an Athei&s;t. I will not ju&s;tify bitter Re&s;ent|ments and unholy Wrath in any Man, much le&s;s in a Chri&s;tian, and lea&s;t of all in a Clergyman. But if Sallies of Human Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd &s;ometimes appear even in the be&s;t, it will not &s;urpri&s;e any one who re|flects on the Sarca&s;ms and ill Manners with which they are treated by the Minute Philo&s;ophers. For as <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;omewhere ob&s;erves, <HI>Habet quendam aculeum Contumelia, quem pati prudentes ac viri boni difficillim&egrave; po&s;&s;unt.</HI> But although you might &s;ometimes ob&s;erve particular Per&s;ons, profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, run into faulty Extremes of any kind through Pa&s;|&s;ion and Infirmity, while Infidels of a more calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Temper &s;hall perhaps behave better. Yet the&s;e natural Tendencies on either &s;ide prove nothing, either in favour of Infidel Principles, or again&s;t Chri&s;tian. If a Believer doth Evil it is owing to the Man not to his Belief. And if an Infidel doth good it is owing to the Man and not to his Infidelity.</P>

<P><HI>LYS.</HI> To cut this Matter &s;hort, I &s;hall bor|row an Allu&s;ion to Phy&s;ic, which one of you made u&s;e of again&s;t our Sect. It will not be denied, that the Clergy pa&s;s for Phy&s;icians of the Soul, and that Religion is a &s;ort of Medicine which they deal in and admini&s;ter. If then Souls in great numbers are di|&s;ea&s;ed and lo&s;t, how can we think the Phy&s;ician skil|ful or his Phy&s;ic good? It is a common Complaint, that Vice increa&s;es, and Men grow daily more and more wicked. If a Shepherd's Flock be di&s;ea&s;ed or un&s;ound, who is to blame but the Shepherd, for ne|glecting or not knowing how to cure them? a Fig therefore for &s;uch Shepherds, &s;uch Phy&s;ic, and &s;uch
<PB N="175" REF="186">
Phy&s;icians, who like other Mountebanks, with great Gravity and elaborate Harangues put off their Pills to the People, who are never the better for them. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Nothing &s;eems more rea&s;onable than this Remark, that Men &s;hou'd judge of a Phy&s;ician, and his Phy&s;ic by its Effect on the Sick. But Pray, <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> wou'd you judge of a Phy&s;ician by tho&s;e Sick, who take his Phy&s;ic and follow his Pre&s;criptions, or by tho&s;e who do not? <HI>LYS.</HI> Doubtle&s;s by tho&s;e who do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> What &s;hall we &s;ay then, if great numbers refu&s;e to take the Phy&s;ic, or in&s;tead of it take Poi&s;on of a direct contrary Nature pre&s;cribed by others, who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;credit the Phy&s;ician and his Medicines, to hinder Men from u&s;ing them, and to de&s;troy their Effect by Drugs of their own? Shall the Phy&s;ician be blamed for the mi&s;carriage of tho&s;e People? <HI>LYS.</HI> By no means. <HI>EUPH.</HI> By a parity of Rea&s;on &s;hou'd it not follow, that the Tendency of religious Doctrines ought to be judged of by the Effects which they produce, not up|on all who hear them, but upon tho&s;e only who re|ceive or believe them? <HI>LYS.</HI> It &s;eems &s;o. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Therefore to proceed fairly, &s;hall we not judge of the Effects of Religion by the Religious, of Faith by Be|lievers, of Chri&s;tianity by Chri&s;tians?</P>

<P>It is certainly right to judge of Principles from their Effects, but then we mu&s;t know them to be Effects of tho&s;e Principles. It is the very Method I have ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to Religion and the Mi|nute Philo&s;ophy. And I can hone&s;tly aver, that I never knew any Man or Family grow wor&s;e in pro|portion as they grew religious: But I have often ob|&s;erved that Minute Philo&s;ophy is the wor&s;t thing which can get into a Family, the readie&s;t way to im|poveri&s;h, divide and di&s;grace it. <HI>ALC.</HI> By the &s;ame Method of tracing Cau&s;es from their Effects, I have made it my Ob&s;ervation, that the Love of Truth, Virtue, and the Happine&s;s of Mankind are &s;pecious Pretexts, but not the inward Principles that &s;et Di|vines

at work: El&s;e why &s;hou'd they affect to abu&s;e Human Rea&s;on, to di&s;parage natural Religion, to traduce the Philo&s;ophers as they univer&s;ally do? <HI>CRI.</HI> Not &s;o univer&s;ally perhaps as you imagine. A Chri|&s;tian, indeed, is for confining Rea&s;on within its due Bounds; and &s;o is every rea&s;onable Man. If we are forbid meddling with unprofitable Que&s;tions, vain Philo&s;ophy, and Science fal&s;ly &s;o called, it cannot be thence inferred, that all Inquiries into profitable Que&s;tions, u&s;eful Philo&s;ophy, and true Science, are unlawful. A Minute Philo&s;opher may indeed im|pute, and perhaps a weak Brother may imagine tho&s;e Inferences, but Men of Sen&s;e will never make them. God is the common Father of Lights; and all Know|ledge really &s;uch, whether natural or revealed, is de|rived from the &s;ame Source of Light and Truth. To ama&s;s together Authorities upon &s;o plain a Point wou'd be needle&s;s. It mu&s;t be owned &s;ome Mens at|tributing too much to Human Rea&s;on, hath, as is natural, made others attribute too little to it. But thus much is generally acknowledged, that there is a natural Religion, which may be di&s;covered and prov|ed by the light of Rea&s;on, to tho&s;e who are capable of &s;uch Proofs. But it mu&s;t be withal acknowledged, that Precepts and Oracles from Heaven are incompa|rably better &s;uited to popular Improvement and the good of Society, than the Rea&s;onings of Philo&s;o|phers; and accordingly we do not find, that natural or rational Religion ever became the popular national Religion of any Country.</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> This is the true Spirit of the Party, never to allow a Grain of U&s;e or Goodne&s;s to any thing out of their own Pale: But we have had learned Men who have done Ju&s;tice to the Religion of the <HI>Gentiles.

<P>To make a right Judgment of the Effects of the Chri&s;tian Religion, let us take a &s;urvey of the pre|vailing Notions and Manners of this very Country where we live, and compare them with tho&s;e of our Heathen Predece&s;&s;ors. <HI>ALC.</HI> I have heard much of the glorious Light of the Go&s;pel, and &s;hou'd be glad to &s;ee &s;ome Effects of it in my own dear Country, which, by the bye, is one of the mo&s;t corrupt and profligate upon Earth, notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;ted Purity of our Religion. But it wou'd look mean and diffident, to affect a Compari&s;on with the barbarous Heathen, from whence we drew our Original: If you wou'd do Honour to your Religion, dare to make it with the mo&s;t renowned Heathens of Antiquity. <HI>CRI.</HI> It is a common Prejudice, to de&s;pi&s;e the pre|&s;ent and over-rate remote Times and Things. Some|thing of this &s;eems to enter into the Judgments Men make of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> For though it mu&s;t be allowed, tho&s;e Nations produced &s;ome noble Spi|rits and great Patterns of Virtue: yet upon the whole, it &s;eems to me they were much inferior in point of real Virtue and good Morals, even to this corrupt and Profligate Nation, as you are now plea&s;ed to call it in di&s;honour to our Religion; however you may think fit to characterize it, when you wou'd do ho|nour to the Minute Philo&s;ophy. This, I think, will be plain to any one, who &s;hall turn off his Eyes from a few &s;hining Characters, to view the general

Manners and Cu&s;toms of tho&s;e People. Their in&s;o|lent treatment of Captives, even of the highe&s;t Rank and &s;ofter Sex, their unnatural expo&s;ing of their own Children, their bloody Gladiatorian Spectacles, com|pared with the common Notions of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> are to me a plain Proof, that our Minds are much &s;oftened by Chri&s;tianity. Cou'd any thing be more unju&s;t, than the condemning a young Lady to the mo&s;t infa|mous Puni&s;hment and Death for the guilt of her Fa|ther, or a whole Family of Slaves, perhaps &s;ome hundreds for a Crime committed by one? Or more Abominable than their Bacchanals and unbridled Lu&s;ts of every kind? which, notwith&s;tanding all that has been done by Minute Philo&s;ophers to debauch the Nation, and their &s;ucce&s;sful Attempts on &s;ome part of it, have not yet been matched among us, at lea&s;t not in every circum&s;tance of Impudence and Ef|frontery. While the <HI>Romans</HI> were poor, they were temperate; but, as they grew rich, they became luxurious to a degree that is hardly believed or con|ceived by us. It cannot be denied, the old <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit was a great one. But it is as certain, there have been numberle&s;s Examples of the mo&s;t re&s;olute and clear Courage in <HI>Britons,</HI> and in general from a Reli|gious Cau&s;e. Upon the whole, it &s;eems an in&s;tance of the greate&s;t Blindne&s;s and Ingratitude, that we do not &s;ee and own the exceeding great Benefits of Chri&s;|tianity, which, to omit higher con&s;iderations, hath &s;o vi&s;ibly &s;oftened, poli&s;hed, and embelli&s;hed our Manners.</P>

I will by no means make an Apology for every <HI>Goth</HI> that walks the Streets, with a determined purpo&s;e to murder any Man who &s;hall but &s;pit in his Face, or give him the Lye. Nor do I think the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion is in the lea&s;t an&s;werable, for a practice &s;o di|rectly oppo&s;ite to its Precepts, and which obtains only among the idle part of the Nation, your Men of Fa&s;hion; who, in&s;tead of Law, Rea&s;on or Reli|gion, are governed by Fa&s;hion. Be plea&s;ed to con&s;i|der that what may be, and truly is, a mo&s;t &s;candalous reproach to a Chri&s;tian Country, may be none at all to the Chri&s;tian Religion: For the Pagan encouraged Men in &s;everal Vices, but the Chri&s;tian in none. <HI>ALC.</HI> Give me leave to ob&s;erve, that what you now &s;ay is foreign to the purpo&s;e. For the que&s;tion, at pre&s;ent, is not concerning the re&s;pective tendencies of the Pa|gan and the Chri&s;tian Religions, but concerning our Manners, as actually compared with tho&s;e of ancient Heathens, who I aver had no &s;uch barbarous Cu&s;tom as Duelling. <HI>CRI.</HI> And I aver that, bad as this is, they had a wor&s;e; and that was Poi&s;oning. By which we have rea&s;on to think there were many more Lives de&s;troyed, than by this <HI>Gothic</HI> Crime of Duel|ling: Ina&s;much as it extended to all Ages, Sexes, and Characters, and as its Effects were more &s;ecret and unavoidable; and as it had more Temptations, Intere&s;t as well as Pa&s;&s;ion, to recommend it to wick|ed Men. And for the Fact, not to wa&s;te time, I refer you to the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors them&s;elves. <HI>LYS.</HI> It is very true: Duelling is not &s;o general a Nu&s;ance as Poi&s;oning, nor of &s;o ba&s;e a Nature. This Crime, if it be a Crime, is in a fair way to keep its ground in &s;pight of the Law and the Go&s;pel. The Clergy ne|ver preach again&s;t it, becau&s;e them&s;elves never &s;uffer by it: and the Man of honour mu&s;t not appear again&s;t the means of vindicating Honour. <HI>CRI.</HI> Though it be remarked by &s;ome of your Sect, that the Clergy are not u&s;ed to preach again&s;t Duelling, yet I neither think the Remark it &s;elf ju&s;t, nor the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="183" REF="194">
for it. In effect, one half of their Sermons, all that is &s;aid of Charity, Brotherly Love, Forbearance, Meekne&s;s, and Forgiving Injuries is directly again&s;t this wicked Cu&s;tom; by which the Clergy them|&s;elves are &s;o far from never &s;uffering, that perhaps they will be found, all things con&s;idered, to &s;uffer oftner than other Men. <HI>LYS.</HI> How do you make this appear? <HI>CRI.</HI> An Ob&s;erver of Mankind may remark two kinds of Bully, the Fighting and the Tame, both public Nu&s;ances, the former (who is the more dangerous Animal, but by much the le&s;s com|mon of the two) employs him&s;elf wholly and &s;olely again&s;t the Laity, while the tame Species exert their Talents upon the Clergy. The Qualities con&s;tituent of this tame Bully are natural Rudene&s;s joined with a delicate &s;en&s;e of Danger. For, you mu&s;t know, the force of inbred In&s;olence and ill Manners is not dimi|ni&s;hed, though it acquire a new Determination, from the fa&s;hionable cu&s;tom of calling Men to account for their Behaviour. Hence you may often &s;ee one of the&s;e tame Bullies ready to bur&s;t with Pride and ill Humour, which he dares not vent till a Par&s;on has come in the way to his Relief. And the Man of Raillery, who wou'd as &s;oon bite off his Tongue, as break a je&s;t on the profe&s;&s;ion of Arms in the pre&s;ence of a military Man, &s;hall in&s;tantly brighten up, and a&s;&s;ume a familiar Air with Religion and the Church before Eccle&s;ia&s;tics. <HI>Dorcon,</HI> who pa&s;&s;eth for a Pol|tron and &s;tupid in all other Company, and really is &s;o, when he is got among Clergymen, affects a quite op|po&s;ite Character.

Now if they and our mo|dern <HI>Britons</HI> are weighed in this &s;ame equal balance, you will, if I mi&s;take not, appear to have been pre|judiced in favour of the old <HI>Romans</HI> again&s;t your own Country, probably becau&s;e it profe&s;&s;eth Chri&s;tianity. Whatever in&s;tances of Fraud or Inju&s;tice may be &s;een in Chri&s;tians carry their own cen&s;ure with them, in the care that is taken to conceal them, and the &s;hame that attends their di&s;covery. There is, even at this day, a &s;ort of Mode&s;ty in all our public Coun|cils and Deliberations. And I believe, the bolde&s;t of our Minute Philo&s;ophers wou'd hardly undertake in a popular A&s;&s;embly, to propo&s;e any thing paralled to the Rape of the <HI>Sabines,</HI> the mo&s;t unju&s;t u&s;age of <HI>Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus,</HI> or the ungrateful treat|ment of <HI>Camillus,</HI> which, as a learned Father ob|&s;erves, were in&s;tances of Iniquity agreed to by the public body of the <HI>Romans.</HI> And if <HI>Rome</HI> in her early days were capable of &s;uch flagrant Inju&s;tice, it is mo&s;t certain &s;he did not mend her Manners, as &s;he grew great in Wealth and Empire, having produced Mon&s;ters in every kind of Wickedne&s;s, as far ex|ceeding other Men, as they &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in power. I freely acknowledge, the Chri&s;tian Religion hath not had the &s;ame influence upon the Nation, that it wou'd in ca&s;e it had been always profe&s;&s;ed in its Puri|ty, and cordially believed by all Men. But I will venture to &s;ay, that if you take the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory from one end to the other, and impartially compare it with our own, you will neither find them &s;o good, nor your Countrymen &s;o bad as you imagine. On the contrary an indifferent Eye may, I verily think, per|ceive a vein of Charity and Ju&s;tice, the effect of Chri&s;tian Principles, run through the latter; which, though not equally di&s;cernible in all parts, yet di&s;clo|&s;eth it &s;elf &s;ufficiently to make a wide difference up|on the whole in &s;pight of the general Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions of Human Nature, as well as of the particu|lar

admired Authors of a Minute Philo&s;opher, mu&s;t therefore be a received Opinion, much le&s;s a Truth grounded on the Experience and Ob&s;ervation of Man|kind.

What is the Sum and Sub&s;tance, Scope and End of Chri&s;t's Religion, but the Love of God and Man? To which all other Points and Duties are relative and &s;ubordinate, as Parts or Means, as Signs, Principles, Motives, or Effects. Now I wou'd fain know, how it is po&s;&s;i|ble for Evil or Wickedne&s;s of any kind to &s;pring from &s;uch a &s;ource. I will not pretend, there are no evil Qualities in Chri&s;tians, nor good in Minute Phi|lo&s;ophers.

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> It mu&s;t be owned there is a fair out|&s;ide, and many plau&s;ible things may be &s;aid, for the Chri&s;tian Religion taken &s;imply as it lies in the Go&s;|pel. But it is the Ob&s;ervation of one of our great Writers, that the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Preachers very cun|ningly began with the faire&s;t Face and the be&s;t moral Doctrines in the World. It was all Love, Charity, Meekne&s;s, Patience and &s;o forth.

The ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> it mu&s;t be owned, had a high and fierce Spirit, which produced eager Contentions and very bloody Cata&s;trophes. The <HI>Greeks,</HI> on the other hand, were a polite and gentle &s;ort of Men, &s;oftened by Arts and Philo&s;ophy. It is impo&s;&s;ible to think of the little States and Cities of <HI>Greece,</HI> with|out wi&s;hing to have lived in tho&s;e times, without ad|miring their Policy and eavying their Happine&s;s. <HI>CRI.</HI> Men are apt to con&s;ider the dark &s;ides of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the bright ones of things out of their reach. A fine Climate, elegant Ta&s;te, polite Amu&s;ements, love of Liberty, and a mo&s;t ingenious inventive Spirit for Arts and Sciences were indi&s;pu|table Prerogatives of ancient <HI>Greece.</HI> But as for Peace and Quietne&s;s, Gentlene&s;s and Humanity, I think we have plainly the advantage: For tho&s;e envied Cities compo&s;ed of gentle <HI>Greeks</HI> were not without their Factions, which per&s;ecuted each other with &s;uch Treachery, Rage, and Malice, that in re&s;pect of them our factious Folk are meer Lambs. To be con|vinced of this Truth, you need only look into <HI>Thucy|dides</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucyd. l. 3.</NOTE>, where you will find tho&s;e Cities in general in|volved in &s;uch bitter Factions, as for Fellow-Citizens without the formalities of War, to murder one ano|ther, even in their Senate-hou&s;es and their Temples, no regard being had to Merit, Rank, Obligation, or Nearne&s;s of Blood. And if Human Nature boiled up to &s;o vehement a pitch in the polite&s;t People, what wonder that &s;avage Nations &s;hou'd &s;calp, roa&s;t, tor|ture, and de&s;troy each other, as they are known to do? It is therefore plain, that without Religion there wou'd not be wanting Pretexts for Quarrels and Debates; all which can very ea&s;ily be accounted for by the natural Infirmities and Corruption of Men.

apt to think it was a peculiar Reverence for their re|&s;pective Laws and In&s;titutions, which in&s;pired them with Steadine&s;s and Courage, and that hearty gene|rous Love of their Country, by which they did not meerly under&s;tand a certain Language or Tribe of Men, much le&s;s a particular &s;pot of Earth, but inclu|ded a certain Sy&s;tem of Manners, Cu&s;toms, Notions, Rites, and Laws Civil and Religious. <HI>ALC.</HI> Oh!

<P>But there is a &s;ort of War and Warriors pe|culiar to Chri&s;tendom, which the Heathens had no notion of: I mean Di&s;putes in Theology and Pole|mical Divines, which the World hath been wonder|fully pe&s;tered with: the&s;e Teachers of Peace, Meek|ne&s;s, Concord, and what not! if you take their word for it: But, if you ca&s;t any eye upon their Practice, you find them to have been in all Ages the mo&s;t contentious, quarrel&s;ome, di&s;agreeing Crew that ever appeared upon Earth. To ob&s;erve the Skill and Sophi&s;try, the Zeal and Eagerne&s;s, with which tho&s;e Barbarians, the School Divines, &s;plit Hairs and conte&s;t about Chimaera's, gives me more Indignation, as being more ab&s;urd and a greater &s;can|dal to human Rea&s;on, than all the ambitious Intrigues, Cabals, and Politics of the Court of <HI>Rome. CRI.</HI> If Divines are quarrel&s;ome, that is not &s;o far forth as Divine, but as Undivine and Unchri&s;tian.

<PB N="191" REF="204">
cannot be Ju&s;tice, or the Effect of Ju&s;tice, &s;o Poi|&s;on cannot be Medicine or the Effect of Medicine, &s;o neither can Pride or Strife be Religion or the effect of Religion. Having premi&s;ed this, I acknowledge, you may often &s;ee hot-headed Bigots engage them&s;elves in religious as well as civil Parties, without being of cre|dit or &s;ervice to either. And as for the Schoolmen in particular, I do not in the lea&s;t think the Chri&s;tian Religion concerned in the Defence of them, their Tenets, or their Method of handling them: but, whatever futility there may be in their Notions, or in|elegancy in their Language, in pure ju&s;tice to Truth one mu&s;t own, they neither banter nor rail nor de|claim in their Writings, and are &s;o far from &s;hewing Fury or Pa&s;&s;ion, that perhaps an impartial Judge will think, the Minute Philo&s;ophers are by no means to be compared with them, for keeping clo&s;e to the Point, or for Temper and good Manners. But after all, if Men are puzzled, wrangle, talk non&s;en&s;e, and quarrel about Religion, &s;o they do about Law, Phy|&s;ic, Politics, and every thing el&s;e of moment. I ask whether in the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, or in any other, where men have refined and ab&s;tracted, they do not run in|to Di&s;putes, Chicane, Non&s;en&s;e, and Contradictions, as well as in Divinity? And yet this doth not hinder but there may be many excellent Rules, and ju&s;t No|tions, and u&s;eful Truths in all tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions. In all Di&s;putes human Pa&s;&s;ions too often mix them&s;elves, in proportion as the Subject is conceived to be more or le&s;s important. But we ought not to confound the Cau&s;e of Men with the Cau&s;e of God, or make Hu|man Follies an Objection to Divine Truths. It is ea|&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h what looks like Wi&s;dom from above, and what proceeds from the pa&s;&s;ion and weakne&s;s of Men.

And if not, why do you mea&s;ure with one Rule to the Clergy, and another to the Laity? Sure|ly the be&s;t Rea&s;on that can be given for this is Preju|dice. Shou'd any Man rake together all the Mi&s;|chiefs that have been committed in all Ages and Na|tions, by Soldiers and Lawyers, you wou'd, I &s;up|po&s;e, conclude from thence, not that the State &s;hou'd be deprived of tho&s;e u&s;eful Profe&s;&s;ions, but only that their Exorbitances &s;hou'd be guarded again&s;t and pu|ni&s;hed. If you took the &s;ame equitable Cour&s;e with the Clergy, there wou'd indeed be le&s;s to be &s;aid a|gain&s;t you; but then you wou'd have much le&s;s to &s;ay. This plain obvious Con&s;ideration, if every one who read con&s;idered, wou'd le&s;&s;en the Credit of your Declaimers. <HI>ALC.</HI> But when all is &s;aid that can be &s;aid, it mu&s;t move a Man's Indignation to &s;ee rea|&s;onable Creatures, under the Notion of Study and Learning, employ'd in reading and writing &s;o many voluminous Tracts, <HI>de lan&acirc; caprin&acirc;.

I dare affirm, becau&s;e I know it to be true, that any impartial Ob&s;erver, although they &s;hou'd not come up to what in Theory he might wi&s;h or imagine, will neverthele&s;s find them much &s;uperior to tho&s;e that in Fact are to be found in other Countries, and far beyond the mean Picture that is drawn of them by Minute Philo&s;ophers.

<PB N="200" REF="213">
the Clergy, it being my &s;incere Opinion, that what|ever Learning or Knowledge we have among us, is derived from that Order. If tho&s;e, who are &s;o &s;aga|cious at di&s;covering a Mote in other Eyes, wou'd but purge their own, I believe they might ea&s;ily &s;ee this Truth. For what but Religion cou'd kindle and pre|&s;erve a Spirit towards Learning, in &s;uch a Northern rough People? <HI>Greece</HI> produced Men of active and &s;ubtile Genius. The public Conventions and Aemu|lations of their Cities forwarded that Genius: And their natural Curio&s;ity was amu&s;ed and excited by lear|ned Conver&s;ations, in their public Walks and Gar|dens and Porticos. Our Genius leads to Amu&s;ements of a gro&s;&s;er kind: we breathe a gro&s;&s;er and a colder Air: and that Curio&s;ity which was general in the <HI>A|thenians,</HI> and the gratifying of which was their chief Recreation, is among our People of Fa&s;hion treated like Affectation, and as &s;uch bani&s;hed from polite A&s;|&s;emblies and places of Re&s;ort; and without doubt wou'd in a little Time be bani&s;hed the Country, if it were not for the great Re&s;ervoirs of Learning, where tho&s;e Formali&s;ts, Pedants, and bearded Boys, as your profound Critic calls them, are maintained by the Li|berality and Piety of our Predece&s;&s;ors. For it is as evident that Religion was the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Semina|ries, as it is that they are the Cau&s;e or Source of all the Learning and Ta&s;te which is to be found, even in tho&s;e very Men who are the declared Enemies of our Religion and public Foundations. Every one, who knows any thing, knows we are indebted for our Learning to the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues. This tho&s;e &s;evere Cen&s;ors will readily grant. Perhaps they may not be &s;o ready to grant, what all Men mu&s;t &s;ee, that we are indebted for tho&s;e Tongues to our Religion.

but a regard to the Holy Scriptures, and Theological Writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church? And in fact, do we not find that the Learning of tho&s;e Times was &s;olely in the Hands of Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, that they alone lighted the Lamp in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion one from another, and tran&s;mitted it down to After-ages; and that ancient Books were collected and pre&s;erved in their Colleges and Seminaries, when all Love and Re|membrance of polite Arts and Studies was extingui&s;h|ed among the Laity, who&s;e Ambition intirely turned to Arms?</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> There is, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, one &s;ort of Learning undoubtedly of Chri&s;tian Original, and peculiar to the Univer&s;ities; where our Youth &s;pend &s;everal Years in acquiring that my&s;terious jar|gon of Schola&s;tici&s;m; than which there cou'd never have been contrived a more effectual Method, to per|plex and confound Human Under&s;tanding.

Surely it wou'd be no &s;uch de|plorable lo&s;s of Time, if a young Gentleman &s;pent a few Months upon that &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed and decried Art of Logic, a Surfeit of which is by no means the prevailing Nu&s;ance of this Age. It is one thing to wa&s;te one's Time in learning and unlearning the bar|barous Terms, wiredrawn Di&s;tinctions, and prolix Sophi&s;try of the Schoolmen, and another to attain &s;ome exactne&s;s in Defining and Arguing: Things perhaps not altogether beneath the Dignity even of a

Minute Philo&s;opher.

But tho&s;e Times are pa&s;&s;ed; and that, which had been cultivated as the principal Learning for &s;ome Ages, is now con&s;idered in another Light, and by no means makes that Figure in the Univer&s;ities, or bears that Part in the Studies of young Gentlemen educa|ted there, which is pretended by tho&s;e admirable Re|formers of Religion and Learning, the Minute Phi|lo&s;ophers.</P>

After all, even tho&s;e of

Be&s;ides, other Animals are, by the Law of their Nature, determined to one certain end or kind of Being, without Inclination or Means either to deviate or go beyond it. But Man hath in him a Will and higher Principle; by virtue whereof he may pur&s;ue different or even contrary ends, and either fall &s;hort of or exceed the Perfection natural to his Species in this World, as he is capable either, by giv|ing up the Reins to his &s;en&s;ual Appetites, of degrad|ing him&s;elf into the condition of Brutes, or el&s;e, by well ordering and improving his Mind, of being transformed into the &s;imilitude of Angels.

And &s;urely whatever there is of &s;illy, narrow, and uncharitable in the Bi|got, the &s;ame is in great mea&s;ure to be imputed to the conceited Ignorance, and petulant Profanene&s;s of the Libertine.

Where nothing is exported the Nation lo&s;eth no|thing: and it is all one to the Public, whether Mo|ney circulates at Home through the Hands of a Vicar or a Squire. Then as for private Men, who, for want of Thought, are full of Complaint about the pay|ment of Tithes; can any Man ju&s;tly complain of it as a Tax, that he pays what never belonged to him? The Tenant rents his Farm with this Condition, and pays his Landlord proportionably le&s;s, than if his Farm had been exempt from it: So he lo&s;eth nothing; it being all one to him, whether he pays his Pa&s;tor or his Landlord. The Landlord cannot complain that he has not what he hath no Right to, either by Grant, Purcha&s;e, or Inheritance. This is the Ca&s;e of Tithes; and as for the Church Lands, he &s;urely can be no Free-thinker, nor any Thinker at all, who doth not &s;ee that no Man whether Noble, Gentle, or Plebeian, hath any &s;ort of Right or Claim to them, which he may not with equal Ju&s;tice pretend to all the Lands in the Kingdom. <HI>LYS.</HI> At pre&s;ent indeed we have no Right, and that is our Complaint. <HI>CRI.</HI> You wou'd have then what you have no Right to. <HI>LYS.</HI> Not &s;o neither: what we wou'd have is fir&s;t a Right convey'd by Law, and in the next place, the Lands by virtue of &s;uch Right. <HI>CRI.</HI> In order to this, it might be expe|dient in the fir&s;t place, to get an Act pa&s;&s;ed for ex|communicating from all civil Rights every Man, that is a Chri&s;tian, a Scholar, and wears a black Coat, as guilty of three capital Offences again&s;t the public Weal of this Realm. <HI>LYS.</HI> To deal frankly, I think it wou'd be an excellent good Act.

It is grant|ed there may be found, now and then, &s;pleen and ill|breeding in the Clergy: But are not the &s;ame Faults incident to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laymen, of a retired Education and Country Life? I grant there is infinite Futility in the Schoolmen: but I deny that a Volume of that doth &s;o much Mi&s;chief, as a page of Minute Philo|&s;ophy. That weak or wicked Men &s;hou'd, by fa|vour of the World, creep into Power and high Sta|tions in the Church, is nothing wonderful: and that in &s;uch Stations they &s;hou'd behave like them&s;elves, is natural to &s;uppo&s;e. But all the while it is evident, that not the Go&s;pel but the World, not the Spirit but the Fle&s;h, not God but the Devil, puts them upon their unworthy Atchievements. We make no diffi|culty to grant, that nothing is more infamous than Vice and Ignorance in a Clergyman; nothing more ba&s;e than a Hypocrite, more frivolous than a Pedant, more cruel than an Inqui&s;itor. But it mu&s;t be al&s;o granted by you, Gentlemen, that nothing is more ri|diculous and ab&s;urd, than for pedantic, ignorant, and corrupt Men to ca&s;t the fir&s;t Stone, at every &s;hadow of their own Defects and Vices in other Men.</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> When I con&s;ider the dete&s;table State of Slavery and Super&s;tition, I feel my Heart dilate and expand it &s;elf to gra&s;p that ine&s;timable ble&s;|&s;ing of Liberty, ab&s;olute Liberty in its utmo&s;t unli|mited Extent. This is the &s;acred and high Preroga|tive, the very life and health of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titu|tion. You mu&s;t not therefore think it &s;trange, if with a vigilant and curious Eye, we guard it again&s;t the minute&s;t Apperance of Evil. You mu&s;t even &s;uffer us to cut round about, and very deep, and make u&s;e of the magnifying Gla&s;s, the better to view and extirpate every the lea&s;t &s;peck, which &s;hall di&s;co|ver it &s;elf in what we are careful and jealous to pre|&s;erve, as the Apple of our Eye. <HI>CRI.</HI> As for un|bounded Liberty I leave it to Savages, among whom
<PB N="217" REF="230">
alone I believe it is to be found: But, for the rea&s;ona|ble legal Liberty of our Con&s;titution, I mo&s;t hearti|ly and &s;incerely wi&s;h it may for ever &s;ub&s;i&s;t and flou|ri&s;h among us. You and all other <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> cannot be too vigilant, or too earne&s;t, to pre&s;erve this goodly frame, or to curb and di&s;appoint the wicked Ambition of whoever, Laymen or Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, &s;hall attempt to change our free and gentle Government in|to a &s;lavi&s;h or &s;evere one. But what Pretext can this afford for your Attempts again&s;t Religion, or indeed how can it be con&s;i&s;tent with them? Is not the Pro|te&s;tant Religion a main part of our Legal Con&s;tituti|on? I remember to have heard a Foreigner remark, that we of this I&s;land were very good Prote&s;tans, but no Chri&s;tians. But whatever Minute Philo&s;ophers may wi&s;h, or Foreigners &s;ay, it is certain our Laws &s;peak a different Language. <HI>ALC.</HI> This puts me in mind of the wi&s;e rea&s;oning of a certain &s;age Magi|&s;trate, who, being pre&s;&s;ed by the Raillery and Argu|ments of an ingenious Man, had nothing to &s;ay for his Religion but that, ten Millions of People inhabi|ting the &s;ame I&s;land might, whether right or wrong, if they thought good, e&s;tabli&s;h Laws for the wor|&s;hipping of God in their Temples, and appealing to him in their Courts of Ju&s;tice. And that in ca&s;e ten thou&s;and ingenious Men &s;hou'd publickly deride and trample on tho&s;e Laws, it might be ju&s;t and lawful for the &s;aid ten Millions, to expel the &s;aid ten thou&s;and ingenious Men out of their &s;aid I&s;land. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And pray, what an&s;wer wou'd you make to this remark of the &s;age Magi&s;trate? <HI>ALC.</HI> The an&s;wer is plain. By the Law of Nature, which is &s;uperior to all po&s;i|tive In&s;titutions, Wit and Knowledge have a right to command Folly and Ignorance. I &s;ay, ingenious Men have by natural Right a Dominion over Fools. <HI>EUPH.</HI> What Dominion over the Laws and People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> Minute Philo&s;ophers may be entit|led to by Nature, I &s;hall not di&s;pute, but leave to be con&s;idered by the Public. <HI>ALC.</HI> This Doctrine, it
<PB N="218" REF="231">
mu&s;t be owned, was never thoroughly under&s;tood before our own times. In the la&s;t age <HI>Hobbes</HI> and his Followers, though otherwi&s;e very great Men, de|clared for the Religion of the Magi&s;trate, probably becau&s;e they were afraid of the Magi&s;trate; but times are changed, and the Magi&s;trates may now be afraid of us. <HI>CRI.</HI> I allow the Magi&s;trate may well be afraid of you in one &s;en&s;e, I mean, afraid to tru&s;t you. This brings to my Thoughts a Pa&s;&s;age on the trial of <HI>Leander</HI> for a capital Offence: That Gentleman hav|ing picked out and excluded from his Jury, by peremp|tory exception, all but &s;ome Men of Fa&s;hion and Plea&s;ure, humbly moved when <HI>Dorcon</HI> was going to ki&s;s the Book, that he might be required to declare upon Honour, whether he believed either God or or Go&s;pel. <HI>Dorcon,</HI> rather than hazard his Reputati|on as a Man of Honour and Free-thinker, openly avowed, that he believed in neither. Upon which the Court declared him unfit to &s;erve on a Jury. By the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;o many were &s;et a&s;ide, as made it nece&s;&s;ary to put off the Trial. We are very ea&s;y, re|plied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> about being tru&s;ted to &s;erve on Juries, if we can be admitted to &s;erve in lucrative Employ|ments. <HI>CRI.</HI> But what if the Government &s;hou'd injoin, that every one, before he was &s;worn into Of|fice, &s;hou'd make the &s;ame Declaration which <HI>Dor|con</HI> was required to make? <HI>ALC.</HI> God forbid! I hope there is no &s;uch De&s;ign on foot. <HI>CRI.</HI> What|ever De&s;igns may be on foot, thus much is certain: The Chri&s;tian Reformed Religion is a principal Part and Corner-&s;tone of our free Con&s;titution; and I verily think, the only thing that makes us de&s;erving of Freedom, or capable of enjoying it. Freedom is either a Ble&s;&s;ing or a Cur&s;e as Men U&s;e it. And to me it &s;eems, that if our Religion were once de&s;troy'd from among us, and tho&s;e Notions, which pa&s;s for Prejudices of a Chri&s;tian Education, era&s;ed from the minds of <HI>Britons,</HI> the be&s;t thing that cou'd befal us wou'd be the lo&s;s of our Freedom. Surely a People

wherein there is &s;uch re&s;tle&s;s Ambition, &s;uch high Spirits, &s;uch Animo&s;ity of Faction, &s;o great Inte|re&s;ts in Conte&s;t, &s;uch unbounded Licence of Speech and Pre&s;s, amid&s;t &s;o much Wealth and Luxury, no|thing but tho&s;e <HI>veteres aviae,</HI> which you pretend to extirpate, cou'd have hitherto kept from ruin.</P>

<P>Under the Chri&s;tian Religion this Nati|on hath been greatly improved. From a &s;ort of Sa|vages, we have grown civil, polite, and learned: we have made a decent and noble Figure both at home and abroad. And, as our Religion decrea&s;eth, I am afraid we &s;hall be found to have declined. Why then &s;hou'd we per&s;i&s;t in the dangerous Experiment? <HI>ALC.</HI> One wou'd think, <HI>Crito,</HI> you had forgot the many Ca|lamities occa&s;ioned by Church-men and Religion. <HI>CRI.</HI> And one wou'd think, you had forgot what was an&s;wered this very day to that Objection. But, not to repeat eternally the &s;ame things, I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t place, That if we reflect on the pa&s;t State of Chri&s;tendom, and of our Country in particular, with our Feuds and Factions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting while we were all of the &s;ame Religion, for in&s;tance, that of the White and Red Ro&s;es, &s;o violent and bloody and of &s;uch long continuance; we can have no a&s;&s;urance that tho&s;e ill humours, which have &s;ince &s;hewn them&s;elves under the ma&s;que of Religion, wou'd not have broke out with &s;ome other Pretext, if this had been want|ing. I ob&s;erve in the &s;econd place, that it will not follow from any Ob&s;ervations you can make on our Hi&s;tory, that the Evils, accidentally occa&s;ioned by Religion, bear any proportion either to the good Ef|fects it hath really produced, or the Evils it hath pre|vented. La&s;tly, I ob&s;erve, that the be&s;t things may by accident be the occa&s;ion of Evil; which acciden|tal Effect is not, to &s;peak properly and truly, produ|ced by the good thing it &s;elf, but by &s;ome evil thing, which, being neither Part, Property, nor Effect of it, happens to be joined with it. But I &s;hou'd be a&s;hamed
<PB N="220" REF="233">
to in&s;i&s;t and enlarge on &s;o plain a Point, and &s;hall only add that, whatever Evils this Nation might have for|merly &s;u&s;tained from Super&s;tition, no Man of com|mon &s;en&s;e will &s;ay, the Evils felt or apprehended at pre&s;ent are from that Quarter. Prie&s;tcraft is not the reigning Di&s;temper at this Day. And &s;urely it will be owned, that a wi&s;e Man, who takes upon him to be vigilant for the public Weal, &s;hou'd touch proper things at proper times, and not pre&s;cribe for a Surfeit when the Di&s;temper is a Con&s;umption. <HI>ALC.</HI> I think we have &s;ufficiently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the Subject of this day's Conference. And now, let <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> take it as he will, I mu&s;t in regard to my own Character, as a fair impartial Adver&s;ary, acknowledge there is &s;omething in what <HI>Crito</HI> hath &s;aid upon the U&s;efulne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Religion. I will even own to you that &s;ome of our Sect are for allowing it a Toleration. I remember, at a meeting of &s;everal ingenious Men, af|ter much debate we came &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to divers Re&s;o|lutions. The fir&s;t was, that no Religion ought to be tolerated in the State: But this on more mature thought was judged impracticable. The &s;econd was that all Religions &s;hou'd be tolerated, but none coun|tenanced except Athei&s;m: But it was apprehended, that this might breed Contentions among the lower &s;ort of People. We came therefore to conclude in the third place, that &s;ome Religion or other &s;hou'd be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the u&s;e of the Vulgar. And after a long Di&s;pute what this Religion &s;hou'd be, <HI>Ly&s;is</HI> a brisk young Man, perceiving no &s;igns of Agreement, propo&s;ed that the pre&s;ent Religion might be tolerated, till a better was found. But allowing it to be expedi|ent, I can never think it true, &s;o long as there lie un|an&s;werable Objections again&s;t it, which if you plea&s;e, I &s;hall take the Liberty to propo&s;e at our next meet|ing. To which we all agreed.</P>
