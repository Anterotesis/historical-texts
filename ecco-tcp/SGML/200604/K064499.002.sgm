<HEAD>CHAP. I. Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>I&s;. lii. 13. liii. "BEHOLD, my &s;ervant &s;hall deal prudently, he &s;hall be exalted, and extolled, and be very high. As many were a&s;toni&s;hed at thee; his vi&s;age was &s;o marred more than any man, and his form more than the &s;ons of men: &s;o &s;hall he &s;prinkle many nations; the kings &s;hall &s;hut their mouths at him; for that which had not been told them &s;hall they &s;ee; and that which they had not heard &s;hall they con&s;i|der. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
<PB N="2" REF="7">
For he &s;hall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeline&s;s; and when we &s;hall &s;ee him, there is no beauty that we &s;hould de&s;ire him. He is de&s;pi&s;ed and re|jected of men, a man of &s;orrows, and ac|quainted with grief: and we hid, as it were, our faces from him; he was de&s;pi&s;ed, and we e&s;teemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our &s;orrows: yet we did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our ini|quities: the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him; and with his &s;tripes we are healed. All we like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppre&s;&s;ed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep before her &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from pri&s;on and from judgement; and who &s;hall declare his generation? for he was cut
<PB N="3" REF="8">
off out of the land of the living: for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my people was he &s;tricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; becau&s;e he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him; he hath put him to grief. When thou &s;halt make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, he &s;hall prolong his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand. He &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied: by his knowledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many; for he &s;hall bear their ini|quities. Therefore will I divide him a por|tion with the great, and he &s;hall divide the &s;poil with the &s;trong; becau&s;e he hath poured out his &s;oul unto death: and he was numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; and he bare the &s;in of many, and made interce&s;&s;ion for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>The&s;e words are extant in a book, pur|porting to contain the predictions of a writer,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
who lived &s;even centuries before the Chri&s;|tian aera.</P>
<P>That material part of every argument from prophecy, namely, that the words alledged were actually &s;poken or written be|fore the fact, to which they are applied, took place, or could by any natural means be fore|&s;een, is, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, inconte&s;table. The record comes out of the cu&s;tody of ad|ver&s;aries. The Jews, as an ancient father well ob&s;erved, are our librarians. The pa&s;|&s;age is in their copies as well as in ours. With many attempts to explain it away, none has ever been made by them to di&s;|credit its authenticity.</P>
<P>And, what adds to the force of the quo|tation is, that it is taken from a writing <HI>declaredly prophetic;</HI> a writing, profe&s;&s;ing to de&s;cribe &s;uch future tran&s;actions and changes in the world, as were connected with the fate and intere&s;ts of the Jewi&s;h nation. It is not a pa&s;&s;age in an hi&s;torical or devotional compo&s;ition, which, becau&s;e it
<PB N="5" REF="10">
turns out to be applicable to &s;ome future events, or to &s;ome future &s;ituation of affairs, is pre&s;umed to have been oracular. The words of I&s;aiah were delivered by him in a prophetic character, with the &s;olemnity be|longing to that character; and what he &s;o delivered, was all along under&s;tood by the Jewi&s;h reader to refer to &s;omething that was to take place after the time of the author. The public &s;entiments of the Jews, con|cerning the de&s;ign of I&s;aiah's writings, are &s;et forth in the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus: "He &s;aw, by an excellent &s;pirit, what &s;hould come to pa&s;s at the la&s;t, and he comforted them that mourned in Sion. He &s;hewed what &s;hould come to pa&s;s for ever, and &s;ecret things or ever they came." (ch. xlviii. v. 24.)</P>
<P>It is al&s;o an advantage which this pro|phecy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, that it is intermixed with no other &s;ubject. It is entire, &s;eparate, and uninterruptedly directed to one &s;cene of things.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11">
The <HI>application</HI> of the prophecy to the evangelic hi&s;tory is plain and appropriate. Here is no double &s;en&s;e: no figurative lan|guage, but what is &s;ufficiently intelligible to every reader of every country. The ob&s;cu|rities, by which I mean the expre&s;&s;ions that require a knowledge of local diction, and of local allu&s;ion, are few, and not of great im|portance. Nor have I found that varieties of reading, or a different con&s;truing of the original, produce any material alteration in the &s;en&s;e of the prophecy. Compare the common tran&s;lation with that of Bi&s;hop Lowth, and the difference is not con&s;ider|able. So far as they do differ, Bi&s;hop Lowth's corrections, which are the faithful re&s;ult of an accurate examination, bring the de&s;cription nearer to the New Te&s;tament hi&s;tory than it was before. In the fourth ver&s;e of the fifty-third chapter, what our Bible renders "&s;tricken," he tran&s;lates "ju|dicially &s;tricken:" and in the eighth ver&s;e, the clau&s;e "he was taken from pri&s;on and from judgement," the Bi&s;hop gives "by an oppre&s;&s;ive judgement he was taken off."
<PB N="7" REF="12">
The next words to the&s;e, "who &s;hall de|clare his generation?" are much cleared up in their meaning by the Bi&s;hop's ver&s;ion, "his manner of life who would declare," <HI>i. e.</HI> who would &s;tand forth in his defence? The former part of the ninth ver&s;e, "and he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death," which inverts the circum&s;tances of Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ion, the Bi&s;hop brings out in an order perfectly agreeable to the event; "and his grave was appointed with the wicked, but with the rich man was his tomb." The words in the eleventh ver&s;e, "by his knowledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many," are in the Bi&s;hop's ver&s;ion "by the <HI>knowledge of him</HI> &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many."</P>
<P>It is natural to enquire what turn the Jews them&s;elves give to this prophecy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Vaticinium hoc E&s;aiae e&s;t carnificina Rabbino|rum, de quo aliqui Judaei mihi confe&s;&s;i &s;unt, Rabbinos &s;uos ex propheticis &s;cripturis facile &s;e extricare potui&s;&s;e, <HI>modo E&s;aias tacui&s;&s;et."</HI> Hul&s;e Theol. Jud. p. 318. quoted by Poole in loc.</NOTE>. There is
<PB N="8" REF="13">
good proof that the ancient Rabbins explain|ed it of their expected Me&s;&s;iah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hul&s;e Theol. Jud. p. 430.</NOTE>; but their modern expo&s;itors concur, I think, in re|pre&s;enting it, as a de&s;cription of the cala|mitous &s;tate and intended re&s;toration of the Jewi&s;h people, who are here, as they &s;ay, exhibited under the character of a &s;ingle per&s;on. I have not di&s;covered that their ex|po&s;ition re&s;ts upon any critical arguments, or upon the&s;e in any other than a very minute degree. The clau&s;e in the ninth ver&s;e, which we render "for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my people was he &s;tricken," and in the margin "was the &s;troke upon him," the Jews read, "for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my peo|ple was the &s;troke upon <HI>them."</HI> And what they alledge in &s;upport of the alteration amounts only to this, that the Hebrew pro|noun is capable of a plural, as well as of a &s;ingular &s;ignification, that is to &s;ay, is capa|ble of their con&s;truction as well as ours<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Lowth adopts in this place the reading of the &s;eventy, which gives &s;mitten <HI>to death,</HI> "for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my people was he &s;mitten to death." The addition of the words "to death," makes an end of the Jewi&s;h interpretation of the clau&s;e. And the authority, upon which this reading (though not given by the pre&s;ent Hebrew text) is adopted, Dr. Kennicot has &s;et forth by an argument, not only &s;o cogent, but &s;o clear and popular, that I beg leave to tran&s;cribe the &s;ub&s;tance of it into this note. "Origen, after having quoted at large this prophecy concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, tells us, that having once made u&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age, in a di&s;pute again&s;t &s;ome that were accounted wi&s;e among the Jews, one of them replied, that the words did not mean one man, but one people, the Jews, who were &s;mitten of God, and di&s;per&s;ed among the Gentiles for their conver&s;ion; that he then urged many parts of this prophecy, to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of this interpretation, and that he &s;eemed to pre&s;s them the harde&s;t by this &s;en|tence&mdash;"for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my people was he &s;mitten to death." Now, as Origen, the author of the Hexapla, mu&s;t have under&s;tood Hebrew, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that he would have urged this la&s;t text as &s;o de|ci&s;ive, if the Greek ver&s;ion had not agreed here with the Hebrew text; nor that the&s;e wi&s;e Jews would have been at all di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this quotation, unle&s;s the He|brew text had read agreeably to the words "to death," on which the argument principally depended; for by quoting it immediately, they would have triumphed over him, and reprobated his Greek ver&s;ion. This, whenever they could do it, was their con&s;tant practice in their di&s;putes with the Chri&s;tians. Origen him&s;elf, who laboriou&s;ly compared the Hebrew text with the Septuagint, has recorded the nece&s;&s;ity of arguing with the Jews, from &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages only, as were in the Sep|tuagint agreeable to the Hebrew. Wherefore, as Origen had carefully compared the Greek ver&s;ion of the Septuagint with the Hebrew text; and as he puz|zled and confounded the learned Jews, by urging upon them the reading "to death" in this place; it &s;eems almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to conclude, both from Origen's argument, and the &s;ilence of his Jewi&s;h adver&s;aries, that the Hebrew text at that time actually had the word agreeably to the ver&s;ion of the &s;eventy." Lowth's I&s;aiah, p. 242.</NOTE>.
<PB N="9" REF="14">
And this is all the variation contended for: the re&s;t of the prophecy they read as we do.
<PB N="10" REF="15">
The probability, therefore, of their expo|&s;ition is a &s;ubject of which we are as capable of judging as them&s;elves. This judgement is open indeed to the good &s;en&s;e of every attentive reader. The application which the Jews contend for, appears to me to la|bour under in&s;uperable difficulties; in parti|cular, it may be demanded of them to explain, in <HI>who&s;e</HI> name or per&s;on, if the Jewi&s;h people be the &s;ufferer, does the pro|phet &s;peak, when he &s;ays, "he hath borne <HI>our</HI> griefs, and carried <HI>our</HI> &s;orrows, yet <HI>we.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="16">
did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God and afflicted; but he was wounded for <HI>our</HI> tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for <HI>our</HI> iniquities, the cha&s;ti&s;ement of <HI>our</HI> peace was upon him, and with his &s;tripes <HI>we</HI> are healed." Again, the de&s;cription in the &s;eventh ver&s;e, "he was oppre&s;&s;ed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep before her &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he openeth not his mouth," quadrates with no part of the Jew|i&s;h hi&s;tory with which we are acquainted. The mention of the "grave," and the "tomb," in the ninth ver&s;e, is not very applicable to the fortunes of a nation; and &s;till le&s;s &s;o is the conclu&s;ion of the prophecy in the twelfth ver&s;e, which expre&s;sly repre|&s;ents the &s;ufferings as <HI>voluntary,</HI> and the &s;ufferer as interceding for the offenders, "becau&s;e he hath poured out his &s;oul unto death, and he was numbered with the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, and he bare the &s;in of many, and made interce&s;&s;ion for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>There are other prophecies of the Old
<PB N="12" REF="17">
Te&s;tament, interpreted by Chri&s;tians to re|late to the go&s;pel hi&s;tory, which are de&s;erv|ing both of great regard, and of a very attentive con&s;ideration: but I content my|&s;elf with &s;tating the above, as well becau&s;e I think it the cleare&s;t and the &s;tronge&s;t of all, as becau&s;e mo&s;t of the re&s;t, in order that their value be repre&s;ented with any to|lerable degree of &s;idelity, require a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion un&s;uitable to the limits and nature of this work. The reader will find them di&s;po&s;ed in order, and di&s;tinctly explained in Bi&s;hop Chandler's treati&s;e upon the &s;ubject: and he will bear in mind, what has been often, and, I think, truly, urged by the advocates of Chri&s;tianity, that there is no other eminent per&s;on, to the hi&s;tory of who&s;e life &s;o many circum&s;tances can be made to apply. They who object, that much has been done by the power of chance, the ingenuity of ac|commodation, and the indu&s;try of re&s;earch, ought to try whether the &s;ame, or any thing like it, could be done, if Mahomet, or any other per&s;on, were propo&s;ed as the &s;ubject of Jewi&s;h prophecy.</P>

II. A &s;econd head of argument from pro|phecy, is founded upon our Lord's predic|tions concerning the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;a|lem, recorded by three out of the four evangeli&s;ts.</P>
<P>Luke xxi. 5&mdash;25. "And as &s;ome &s;pake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly &s;tones and gifts, he &s;aid, As for the&s;e things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there &s;hall not be left one &s;tone upon another, that &s;hall not be thrown down. And they a&s;ked him, &s;aying, Ma&s;|ter, but when &s;hall the&s;e things be? and what &s;ign &s;hall there be when the&s;e things &s;hall come to pa&s;s? And he &s;aid, Take heed that ye be not deceived, for many &s;hall come in my name, &s;aying, I am Chri&s;t; and the time draweth near. Go ye not there|fore after them. But, when ye &s;hall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified; for the&s;e things mu&s;t fir&s;t come to pa&s;s, but the end is not by and by. Then &s;aid he unto them, Nation &s;hall ri&s;e again&s;t nation, and kingdom again&s;t kingdom, and great
<PB N="14" REF="19">
earthquakes &s;hall be in divers places, and famines and pe&s;tilences: and fearful &s;ights, and great &s;igns &s;hall there be from heaven. But before all the&s;e, they &s;hall lay their hands on you, and per&s;ecute you, delivering you up to the &s;ynagogues, and into pri&s;ons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's &s;ake. And it &s;hall turn to you for a te&s;timony. Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye &s;hall an&s;wer; for I will give you a mouth and wi&s;dom, which all your adver&s;aries &s;hall not be able to gain&s;ay nor re&s;i&s;t. And ye &s;hall be betrayed both by parents and brethren, and kinsfolk and friends; and &s;ome of you &s;hall they cau&s;e to be put to death. And ye &s;hall be hated of all men for my name's &s;ake. But there &s;hall not an hair of your head peri&s;h. In your patience po&s;&s;e&s;s ye your &s;ouls. And when ye &s;hall &s;ee Jeru&s;a|lem compa&s;&s;ed with armies, then know that the de&s;olation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judea flee to the moun|tains; and let them which are in the mid&s;t of it depart out; and let not them that are
<PB N="15" REF="20">
in the countries enter thereinto. For the&s;e be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give &s;uck, in tho&s;e days; for there &s;hall be great di&s;tre&s;s in the land, and wrath upon this people. And they &s;hall fall by the edge of the &s;word, and &s;hall be led away captive into all nations; and Jeru|&s;alem &s;hall be trodden down of the Gen|tiles, until the time of the Gentiles be ful|filled."</P>
<P>In terms nearly &s;imilar, this di&s;cour&s;e is related in the twenty-fourth chapter of Mat|thew, and the thirteenth of Mark. The pro&s;pect of the &s;ame evils drew from our Saviour, upon another occa&s;ion, the follow|ing affecting expre&s;&s;ions of concern, which are pre&s;erved by St. Luke (xix. 41): "And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, &s;aying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes, for
<PB N="16" REF="21">
the days &s;hall come upon thee, that thine enemies &s;hall ca&s;t a trench about thee, and compa&s;s thee round, and keep thee in on every &s;ide, and &s;hall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee, and they &s;hall not leave in thee one &s;tone upon another, becau&s;e thou knewe&s;t not the time of thy vi&s;itation." The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are direct and explicit predictions. References to the &s;ame event, &s;ome plain, &s;ome parabolical, or otherwi&s;e figurative, are found in divers other di&s;cour&s;es of our Lord <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxi. 33&mdash;46. xxii. 1&mdash;7. Mark xii. 1&mdash;12. Luke xiii. 1&mdash;9. xx. 9&mdash;20. xxi. 5&mdash;13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The general agreement of the de&s;cription with the event, viz. with the ruin of the Jewi&s;h nation, and the capture of Jeru&s;alem under Ve&s;pa&s;ian, thirty-&s;ix years after Chri&s;t's death, is mo&s;t evident: and the accordancy in various articles of detail and circum&s;tance has been &s;hewn by many learned writers. It is al&s;o an advantage to the enquiry, and to the argument built upon it, that we have
<PB N="17" REF="22">
received a copious account of the tran&s;action from Jo&s;ephus, a Jewi&s;h and contemporary hi&s;torian. This part of the ca&s;e is perfectly free from doubt. The only que&s;tion which, in my opinion, can be rai&s;ed upon the &s;ub|ject, is whether the prophecy was really de|livered <HI>before</HI> the event. I &s;hall apply, there|fore, my ob&s;ervations to this point &s;olely.</P>
<P N="1">1. The judgement of antiquity, though varying in the preci&s;e year of the publica|tion of the three go&s;pels, <HI>concurs</HI> in a&s;&s;ign|ing them a date prior to the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xiii.</NOTE>.</P>

They have neither in&s;erted any words, which might &s;ignify to the reader that their accounts were written <HI>before</HI> the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, which a &s;ophi&s;t would have done; nor have they dropped a hint of the completion of the prophecies recorded by them, which an <HI>unde&s;igning</HI> writer, writing <HI>after</HI> the event, could hardly, on &s;ome or other of the many occa&s;ions that pre&s;ented them&s;elves, have mi&s;&s;ed of doing.</P>

<P N="5">5. I think that, if the prophecies had been

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The morality of the go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;tating the morality of the go&s;pel as an argument of its truth, I am willing to admit two points; fir&s;t, that the teaching of mo|rality was not the primary de&s;ign of the mi&s;&s;ion; &s;econdly, that morality, neither in the go&s;pel, nor in any other book, can be a &s;ubject, properly &s;peaking, of di&s;covery.</P>
<P>If I were to de&s;cribe in a very few words the &s;cope of Chri&s;tianity, as a <HI>revelation</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Great and ine&s;timably beneficial effects may ac|crue from the mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and e&s;pecially from his death, which do not belong to Chri&s;tianity as a <HI>revelation;</HI> that is, they might have exi&s;ted, and they might have been accompli&s;hed, though we had never, in this life, been made acquainted with them. The&s;e effects may be very exten&s;ive. They may be intere&s;t|ing even to other orders of intelligent beings.</NOTE>, I &s;hould &s;ay, that it was to influence the
<PB N="25" REF="30">
conduct of human life, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the proof of a future &s;tate of reward and puni&s;h|ment&mdash;"to bring life and immortality to light." The direct object, therefore, of the de&s;ign is, to &s;upply motives, and not rules; &s;anctions, and not precepts. And the&s;e were what mankind &s;tood mo&s;t in need of. The members of civilized &s;ociety can, in all ordi|nary ca&s;es, judge tolerably well how they ought to act; but without a future &s;tate, or, which is the &s;ame thing, without credit|ed evidence of that &s;tate, they want a <HI>motive</HI> to their duty; they want at lea&s;t &s;trength of motive, &s;ufficient to bear up again&s;t the force of pa&s;&s;ion, and the temptation of pre|&s;ent advantage. Their rules want authority. The mo&s;t important &s;ervice that can be ren|dered to human life, and that, con&s;equently, which, one might expect beforehand, would be the great end and office of a revelation from God, is to convey to the world au|thori&s;ed a&s;&s;urances of the reality of a future exi&s;tence. And although, in doing this, or by the mini&s;try of the &s;ame per&s;on by which this is done, moral precepts, or examples,
<PB N="26" REF="31">
or illu&s;trations of moral precepts, may be occa&s;ionally given, and be highly valuable, yet &s;till they do not form the original pur|po&s;e of the mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, morality, neither in the go&s;pel, nor in any other book, can be a &s;ubject of di&s;covery, properly &s;o called. By which propo&s;ition, I mean that there cannot, in morality, be any thing &s;imilar to what are called di&s;coveries in natural philo&s;ophy, in the arts of life, and in &s;ome &s;ciences; as the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, the circulation of the blood, the polarity of the magnet, the laws of gravitation, alphabetical writing, decimal arithmetic, and &s;ome other things of the &s;ame &s;ort; facts, or proofs, or con|trivances, before totally unknown and un|thought of. Whoever therefore expects, in reading the New Te&s;tament, to be &s;truck with di&s;coveries in morals, in the manner in which his mind was affected, when he fir&s;t came to the knowledge of the di&s;co|veries above mentioned; or rather in the manner in which the world was affected by
<PB N="27" REF="32">
them, when they were fir&s;t publi&s;hed; ex|pects what, as I apprehend, the nature of the &s;ubject renders it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould meet with. And the foundation of my opinion is this, that the qualities of ac|tions depend entirely upon their effects, which effects mu&s;t all along have been the &s;ubject of human experience.</P>
<P>When it is once &s;ettled, no matter upon what principle, that to do good is virtue, the re&s;t is calculation. But &s;ince the calcu|lation cannot be in&s;tituted concerning each particular action, we e&s;tabli&s;h intermediate rules: by which proceeding, the bu&s;ine&s;s of morality is much facilitated, for then, it is concerning our rules alone that we need en|quire, whether in their tendency they be beneficial; concerning our actions we have only to a&s;k, whether they be agreeable to the rules. We refer actions to rules, and rules to public happine&s;s. Now, in the formation of the&s;e rules, there is no place for di&s;covery properly &s;o called, but there is
<PB N="28" REF="33">
ample room for the exerci&s;e of wi&s;dom, judgement, and prudence.</P>
<P>As I wi&s;h to deliver argument rather than panegyric, I &s;hall treat of the morality of the go&s;pel, in &s;ubjection to the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions. And after all, I think it &s;uch a mo|rality, as, con&s;idering from whom it came, is mo&s;t extraordinary; and &s;uch, as, with|out allowing &s;ome degree of reality to the character and preten&s;ions of the religion, it is difficult to account for: or to place the argument a little lower in the &s;cale, it is &s;uch a morality, as completely repels the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being the tradition of a barbarous age or of a barbarous people, of the religion being founded in folly, or of its being the production of craft; and it repels al&s;o, in a great degree, the &s;uppo&s;ition of its having been the effu&s;ion of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic mind.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion, under which the &s;ubject may be mo&s;t conveniently treated of, is that
<PB N="29" REF="34">
of the things taught, and the manner of teaching.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t head, I &s;hould willingly, if the limits and nature of my work ad|mitted of it, tran&s;cribe into this chapter the whole of what has been &s;aid upon the mo|rality of the go&s;pel, by the author of <HI>the internal evidence of Chri&s;tianity;</HI> becau&s;e it perfectly agrees with my own opinion, and becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay the &s;ame things &s;o well. This acute ob&s;erver of hu|man nature, and, as I believe, &s;incere con|vert to Chri&s;tianity, appears to me to have made out &s;atisfactorily the two following po&s;itions, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the go&s;pel omits &s;ome qualities, which have u&s;ually engaged the prai&s;es and admiration of mankind, but which, in rea|lity, and in their general effects, have been prejudicial to human happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the go&s;pel has brought forwards &s;ome virtues, which po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t intrin&s;ic
<PB N="30" REF="35">
value, but which have commonly been overlooked and contemned.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions he exem|plifies, in the in&s;tances of friend&s;hip, patriot|i&s;m, active courage; in the &s;en&s;e in which the&s;e qualities are u&s;ually under&s;tood, and in the conduct which they often produce.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, in the in&s;tances of pa&s;&s;ive courage or endurance of &s;ufferings, patience under affronts and injuries, humility, irre|&s;i&s;tance, placability.</P>
<P>The truth is, there are two oppo&s;ite de|&s;criptions of character, under which man|kind may generally be cla&s;&s;ed. The one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es vigour, firmne&s;s, re&s;olution; is daring and active, quick in its &s;en&s;ibilities, jealous of its fame, eager in its attachments, inflexible in its purpo&s;e, violent in its re|&s;entments.</P>
<P>The other, meek, yielding, complying, forgiving; not prompt to act but willing to
<PB N="31" REF="36">
&s;uffer, &s;ilent and gentle under rudene&s;s and in&s;ult, &s;uing for reconciliation where others would demand &s;atisfaction, giving way to the pu&s;hes of impudence, conceding and in|dulgent to the prejudices, the wrong-head|edne&s;s, the intractability of tho&s;e with whom it has to deal.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e characters is, and ever hath been, the favourite of the world. It is the character of great men. There is a dignity in it which univer&s;ally commands re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The latter is poor-&s;pirited, tame, and ab|ject. Yet &s;o it hath happened, that, with the founder of Chri&s;tianity, this latter is the &s;ubject of his commendation, his precepts, his example; and that the former is &s;o, in no part of its compo&s;ition. This, and no|thing el&s;e, is the character de&s;igned in the following remarkable pa&s;&s;ages: "Re&s;i&s;t not evil, but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o; and if any man will &s;ue thee at the law, and
<PB N="32" REF="37">
take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke al&s;o; and who&s;oever &s;hall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain; love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you." This certainly is not common-place morality. It is very original. It &s;hews at lea&s;t (and it is for this purpo&s;e we produce it) that no two things can be more different than the Heroic and the Chri&s;tian character.</P>
<P>Now the author, to whom I refer, has not only remarked this difference more &s;trongly than any preceding writer, but has proved, in contradiction to fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, to popular opinion, to the encomiums of orators and poets, and even to the &s;uffrages of hi&s;torians and morali&s;ts, that the latter character po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t of true worth, both as being mo&s;t difficult either to be ac|quired or &s;u&s;tained, and as contributing mo&s;t to the happine&s;s and tranquillity of &s;ocial life. The &s;tate of his argument is as fol|lows:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="33" REF="38">
I. If this di&s;po&s;ition were univer&s;al, the ca&s;e is clear: the world would be a &s;ociety of friends. Whereas, if the other di&s;po|&s;ition were univer&s;al, it would produce a &s;cene of univer&s;al contention. The world could not hold a generation of &s;uch men.</P>
<P N="2">II. If, what is the fact, the di&s;po&s;ition be partial; if a few be actuated by it, among&s;t a multitude who are not; in whatever de|gree it does prevail, in the &s;ame proportion it prevents, allays, and terminates quarrels, the great di&s;turbers of human happine&s;s, and the great &s;ources of human mi&s;ery, &s;o far as man's happine&s;s and mi&s;ery depend upon man. Without this di&s;po&s;ition enmities mu&s;t not only be frequent, but, once begun, mu&s;t be eternal; for each retaliation being a fre&s;h injury, and, con&s;equently, requiring a fre&s;h <HI>&s;atisfaction,</HI> no period can be a&s;&s;igned to the reciprocation of affronts, and to the progre&s;s of hatred, but that which clo&s;es the lives, or at lea&s;t the intercour&s;e, of the parties.</P>
<P>I would only add to the&s;e ob&s;ervations,
<PB N="34" REF="39">
that, although the former of the two cha|racters above de&s;cribed may be occa&s;ionally u&s;eful; although, perhaps, a great general, or a great &s;tate&s;man, may be formed by it, and the&s;e may be in&s;truments of important benefits to mankind, yet is this nothing more than what is true of many qualities, which are acknowledged to be vicious. <HI>Envy</HI> is a quality of this &s;ort. I know not a &s;tronger &s;timulus to exertion. Many a &s;cholar, many an arti&s;t, many a &s;oldier, has been produced by it. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ince in its general effects it is noxious, it is pro|perly condemned, certainly is not prai&s;ed, by &s;ober morali&s;ts.</P>
<P>It was a portion of the &s;ame character as that we are defending, or rather of his love of the &s;ame character, which our Saviour di&s;played, in his repeated correction of the ambition of his di&s;ciples; his frequent ad|monitions, that greatne&s;s with them was to con&s;i&s;t in humility; his cen&s;ure of that love of di&s;tinction, and greedine&s;s of &s;uperiority, which the chief per&s;ons among&s;t his countrymen
<PB N="35" REF="40">
were wont, on all occa&s;ions, great and little, to betray. "They (the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees) love the uppermo&s;t rooms at fea&s;ts, and the chief &s;eats in the &s;ynagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren; and call no man your father upon the earth, for one is your father, which is in heaven; neither be ye called ma&s;ters, for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t; but he that is greate&s;t among <HI>you</HI> &s;hall be your &s;ervant, and who|&s;oever &s;hall exalt him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, and he that &s;hall humble him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxili. 6. See al&s;o Mark xii. 39. Luke xx. 43. xiv. 7.</NOTE>." I make no farther remark upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, (becau&s;e they are, in truth, only a repetition of the doctrine, different expre&s;&s;ions of the principle, which we have already &s;tated) except that &s;ome of the pa&s;|&s;ages, e&s;pecially our Lord's advice to the gue&s;ts at an entertainment, (Luke xiv. 7.) &s;eem to extend the rule to what we call
<PB N="36" REF="41">
<HI>manners;</HI> which was, both regular in point of con&s;i&s;tency, and not &s;o much beneath the dignity of our Lord's mi&s;&s;ion as may at fir&s;t fight be &s;uppo&s;ed, for bad manners are bad morals.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficiently apparent, that the pre|cepts we have recited, or rather the di&s;po&s;i|tion which the&s;e precepts inculcate, relate to per&s;onal conduct from per&s;onal motives; to ca&s;es in which men act from impul&s;e, for them&s;elves, and from them&s;elves. When it comes to be con&s;idered, what is nece&s;&s;ary to be done for the &s;ake of the public, and out of a regard to the general welfare, (which con&s;ideration, for the mo&s;t part, ought ex|clu&s;ively to govern the duties of men in public &s;tations) it comes to a ca&s;e to which the rules do not belong. This di&s;tinction is plain; and, if it were le&s;s &s;o, the con&s;e|quence would not be much felt, for it is very &s;eldom that, in the intercour&s;e of pri|vate life, men act with public views. The per&s;onal motives, from which they do act, the rule regulates.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="42">
The preference of the patient to the he|roic character, which we have here noticed, and which the reader will find explained at large in the work to which we have referred him, is a peculiarity in the Chri&s;tian in&s;ti|tution, which I propo&s;e as an argument of wi&s;dom, very much beyond the &s;ituation and natural character of the per&s;on who de|livered it.</P>
<P N="2">II. A <HI>&s;econd</HI> argument, drawn from the morality of the New Te&s;tament, is the &s;tre&s;s which is laid by our Saviour upon the re|gulation of the thoughts. And I place this con&s;ideration next to the other, becau&s;e they are connected. The other related to the malicious pa&s;&s;ions; this to the voluptuous. Together they comprehend the whole cha|racter.</P>
<P>"Out of the <HI>heart</HI> proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, &amp;c.&mdash;The&s;e are the things which defile a man." Mat. xv. 19.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43">
"Wo unto you &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, hy|pocrites, for ye make clean the out&s;ide of the cup and of the platter, but <HI>within</HI> they are full of extortion and exce&s;s.&mdash;Ye are like unto whited &s;epulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanne&s;s; even &s;o ye al&s;o outwardly appear righteous unto men, but <HI>within</HI> ye are full of hypo|cri&s;y and iniquity." Mat. xxiii. 25. 27.</P>
<P>And more particularly that &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ion, (Mat. v. 28.) "Who&s;oever looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath com|mitted adultery with her already in his heart."</P>
<P>There can be no doubt with any reflect|ing mind, but that the propen&s;ities of our nature mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to regulation; but the que&s;tion is, <HI>where</HI> the check ought to be placed, upon the thought, or only upon action. In this que&s;tion, our Saviour, in the texts here quoted, has pronounced a deci&s;ive judgment. He makes the control
<PB N="39" REF="44">
of thought e&s;&s;ential. Internal purity with him is every thing. Now I contend that this is the only di&s;cipline which can &s;ucceed; in other words, that a moral &s;y&s;tem, which prohibits actions, but leaves the thoughts at liberty, will be ineffectual, and is therefore unwi&s;e. I know not how to go about the proof of a point, which depends upon expe|rience, and upon a knowledge of the human con&s;titution, better than by citing the judge|ment of per&s;ons, who appear to have given great attention to the &s;ubject, and to be well qualified to form a true opinion about it. Boerhaave, &s;peaking of this very declaration of our Saviour, "Who&s;oever looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath already com|mitted adultery with her in his heart," and under&s;tanding it, as we do, to contain an injunction to lay the check upon the thoughts, was wont to &s;ay, that "our Sa|viour knew mankind better than Socrates." Haller, who has recorded this &s;aying of Boerhaave's, adds to it the following remarks of his own <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters to his Daughter.</NOTE>: "It did not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation
<PB N="40" REF="45">
of our Saviour, that the rejection of any evil thoughts was the be&s;t defence again&s;t vice; for, when a debauched per&s;on &s;ills his imagination with impure pictures, the licentious ideas which he recalls, fail not to &s;timulate his de&s;ires with a degree of vio|lence which he cannot re&s;i&s;t. This will be followed by gratification, unle&s;s &s;ome exter|nal ob&s;tacle &s;hould prevent him from the commi&s;&s;ion of a &s;in, which he had internally re&s;olved on." "Every moment of time (&s;ays our author) that is &s;pent in meditations upon &s;in, increa&s;es the power of the dan|gerous object which has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our ima|gination."

the happine&s;s and comfort of tho&s;e about him," he would have been thought, I doubt not, in any age of the world, and in any, even the mo&s;t improved &s;tate of morals, to have delivered a judicious an&s;wer: becau&s;e, by the fir&s;t direction, he &s;ugge&s;ted the only motive which acts &s;teadily and uniformly, in &s;ight and out of &s;ight, in familiar oc|currences and under pre&s;&s;ing temptations; and in the &s;econd, he corrected, what, of all tendencies in the human character, &s;tands mo&s;t in need of correction, <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> or a contempt of other men's conveniency and &s;atisfaction. In e&s;timating the value of a moral rule, we are to have regard, not only to the particular duty, but the general &s;pirit; not only to what it directs us to do, but to the character which a compliance with its direction is likely to form in us. So, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the rule here recited will never fail to make him who obeys it, <HI>con&s;iderate,</HI> not only of the rights, but of the feelings of other men, bodily and men|tal, in great matters and in &s;mall; of the ea&s;e, the accommodation, the &s;elf-complacency
<PB N="42" REF="47">
of all with whom he has any concern, e&s;pecially of all who are in his power, or dependent upon his will.</P>
<P>Now what, in the mo&s;t applauded philo|&s;opher of the mo&s;t enlightened age of the world, would have been deemed worthy of his wi&s;dom, and of his character, to &s;ay, our Saviour hath &s;aid, and upon ju&s;t &s;uch an occa&s;ion as that which we have feigned.</P>
<P>"Then one of them, which was a lawyer, a&s;ked him a que&s;tion, tempting him, and &s;aying, Ma&s;ter, which is the great com|mandment in the law? Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind; this is the fir&s;t and great com|mandment; and the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf: on the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Mat. xxii. 35&mdash;40.</P>
<P>The &s;econd precept occurs in St. Mat|thew, on another occa&s;ion &s;imilar to this
<PB N="43" REF="48">
(xix. 16.), and both of them upon a third &s;imilar occa&s;ion in Luke (x. 27). In the&s;e two latter in&s;tances, the que&s;tion propo&s;ed was, "What &s;hall I do to inherit eternal life?"</P>
<P>Upon all the&s;e occa&s;ions, I con&s;ider the words of our Saviour as expre&s;&s;ing preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing as what I have put into the mouth of the moral philo&s;opher. Nor do I think that it detracts much from the merit of the an&s;wer, that the&s;e precepts are extant in the Mo&s;aic code: for his laying his fin|ger, if I may &s;o &s;ay, upon the&s;e precepts; his drawing them out from the re&s;t of that voluminous in&s;titution; his &s;tating of them, not &s;imply among&s;t the number, but as the greate&s;t and the &s;um of all the others; in a word, his propo&s;ing of them to his hearers for their rule and principle, was our Savi|our's own.</P>
<P>And what our Saviour had &s;aid upon the &s;ubject, appears to me to have <HI>fixed</HI> the &s;en|timent among&s;t his followers.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49">
St. Paul has it expre&s;sly, "If there be any other commandment, it is briefly com|prehended in this &s;aying, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 7.</NOTE>;" and again, "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy|&s;elf <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 14.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>And it is &s;o well known, as to require no citations to verify it, that this love, or charity, or, in other words, regard to the welfare of others, runs in various forms through all the preceptive parts of the apo&s;tolic
<PB N="45" REF="50">
writings. It is the theme of all their exhortations, that with which their morality begins and ends, from which all their de|tails and enumerations &s;et out, and into which they return.</P>
<P>And that this temper, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, de&s;cended in its purity to &s;ucceeding Chri&s;tians, is atte&s;ted by one of the earlie&s;t and be&s;t of the remaining writings of the apo&s;tolical fathers, the epi&s;tle of the Roman Clement. The meekne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian character reigns throughout the whole of that excellent piece. The occa&s;ion called for it. It was to compo&s;e the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the church of Corinth. And the venerable hearer of the apo&s;tles does not fall &s;hort, in the di&s;play of this principle, of the fine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of their writings. He calls to the remembrance of the Corinthian church its former character, in which "ye were all of you (he tells them) humble minded, not boa&s;ting of any thing, de&s;iring rather to be &s;ubject than to govern, to give than to re|ceive, being content with the portion God

Ye were &s;incere, and without offence, towards each other. Ye bewailed every one his neigh|bour's &s;ins, e&s;teeming their defects your own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ep. Clem. Rom. c. 2. Abp. Wake's Tran&s;lation.</NOTE>." His prayer for them was for the "return of peace, long &s;uffering, and pa|tience<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. 58.</NOTE>." And his advice to tho&s;e, who might have been the occa&s;ion of difference in the &s;ociety, is conceived in the true &s;pirit, and with a perfect knowledge, of the Chri&s;|tian character. "Who is there among you that is generous? Who that is compa&s;&s;ionate? Who that has any charity? Let him &s;ay, if this &s;edition, this contention, and the&s;e &s;chi&s;ms, be upon my account, I am ready to depart, to go away whither&s;oever ye plea&s;e, and do what&s;oever ye &s;hall command

The&s;e things they, who have their conver&s;ation towards God, not to be repent|ed of, both have done, and will always be ready to do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ep. Clem. Rom. c. 54.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This &s;acred principle, this earne&s;t recom|mendation of forbearance, lenity, and for|givene&s;s, mixes with all the writings of that age. There are more quotations in the apo&s;tolical fathers of texts which relate to the&s;e points, than of any other. Chri&s;t's &s;ayings had &s;truck them. "Not rendering (faith Polycarp, the di&s;ciple of John) evil for evil, or railing for railing, or &s;triking for &s;triking, or cur&s;ing for cur&s;ing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pol.

<P>And the rule by parity of rea&s;on is ex|tended to all other virtues.</P>
<P>I do not think, that either in the&s;e, or in any other pa&s;&s;age of the New Te&s;tament, the pur&s;uit of fame is &s;tated as a vice; it is only &s;aid that an action, to be virtuous, mu&s;t be independent of it. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, that it is not publicity, but o&s;tentation, which is prohibited; not the mode, but the motive of the action, which is regulated. A good man will prefer that mode, as well as tho&s;e objects of his beneficence, by which he can produce the greate&s;t effect; and the view of this purpo&s;e may dictate &s;ometimes pub|lication, and &s;ometimes concealment. Either the one or the other may be the <HI>mode</HI> of
<PB N="50" REF="55">
the action, according as the end to be pro|moted by it appears to require. But from the <HI>motive,</HI> the reputation of the deed, and the fruits and advantage of that reputation to our&s;elves, mu&s;t be &s;hut out, or, in what|ever proportion they are not &s;o, the action in that proportion fails of being virtuous.</P>
<P>This exclu&s;ion of regard to human opi|nion, is a difference, not &s;o much in the duties, to which the teachers of virtue would per&s;uade mankind, as in the manner and topics of per&s;ua&s;ion. And in this view the difference is great. When <HI>we</HI> &s;et about to give advice, our lectures are full of the ad|vantages of character, of the regard that is due to appearances and to opinion; of what the world, e&s;pecially of what the good or great, will think and &s;ay; of the value of public e&s;teem, and of the qualities by which men acquire it. Widely different from this was our Saviour's in&s;truction: and the dif|ference was founded upon the be&s;t rea&s;ons. For, however the care of reputation, the authority of public opinion, or even of the
<PB N="51" REF="56">
opinion of good men, the &s;atisfaction of be|ing well received and well thought of, the benefit of being known and di&s;tingui&s;hed, are topics, to which we are fain to have re|cour&s;e in our exhortations, the true virtue is that which di&s;cards the&s;e con&s;iderations ab&s;olutely; and which retires from them all to the &s;ingle internal purpo&s;e of plea&s;ing God. This at lea&s;t was the virtue which our Saviour taught. And in teaching of this, he not only confined the views of his followers to the proper mea&s;ure and prin|ciple of human duty, but acted in con|&s;i&s;tency with his office as a monitor from heaven.</P>
<P>Next to what our Saviour taught, may be con&s;idered the manner of his teaching; which was extremely peculiar, yet, I think, preci&s;ely adapted to the peculiarity of his character and &s;ituation. His le&s;&s;ons did not con&s;i&s;t of di&s;qui&s;itions; of any thing like moral e&s;&s;ays, or like &s;ermons, or like &s;et treati&s;es upon the &s;everal points which he mentioned. When he delivered a precept,
<PB N="52" REF="57">
it was &s;eldom that he added any proof or argument; &s;till &s;eldomer, that he accom|panied it with, what all precepts require, limitations and di&s;tinctions. His in&s;truc|tions were conceived in &s;hort emphatic &s;en|tentious rules, in occa&s;ional reflections, or in round maxims. I do not think that this was a natural, or would have been a pro|per method, for a philo&s;opher or a morali&s;t; or that it is a method which can be &s;ucce&s;s|fully imitated by us. But I contend that it was &s;uitable to the character which Chri&s;t a&s;&s;umed, and to the &s;ituation in which, as a teacher, he was placed. He produced him|&s;elf as a me&s;&s;enger from God. He put the truth of what he taught upon authority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I</HI> &s;ay unto you, Swear not at all; <HI>I</HI> &s;ay unto you, Re&s;i&s;t not evil; <HI>I</HI> &s;ay unto you, Love your enemies <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 34. 39. 44.</NOTE>.</NOTE>. In the choice, therefore, of his mode of teaching, the purpo&s;e by him to be con|&s;ulted was <HI>impre&s;&s;ion;</HI> becau&s;e conviction, which forms the principal end of our di&s;|cour&s;es, was to ari&s;e in the minds of his followers
<PB N="53" REF="58">
from a different &s;ource, from their re&s;pect to his per&s;on and authority. Now, for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ion &s;ingly and ex|clu&s;ively (I repeat again, that we are not here to con&s;ider the convincing of the un|der&s;tanding) I know nothing which would have &s;o great force, as &s;trong ponderous maxims, frequently urged, and frequently brought back to the thoughts of the hearers. I know nothing that could in this view be &s;aid better, than "Do unto others, as ye would that others &s;hould do unto you; the fir&s;t and great commandment is, Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God; and the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf." It mu&s;t al&s;o be remembered, that our Lord's mini&s;try, upon the &s;uppo&s;i|tion either of one year or of three, com|pared with his work, was of &s;hort duration; that, within this time, he had many places to vi&s;it, various audiences to addre&s;s; that his per&s;on was generally be&s;ieged by crowds of followers; that he was, &s;ometimes, driven away from the place where he was teaching, by per&s;ecution, and, at other times, thought
<PB N="54" REF="59">
fit to withdraw him&s;elf from the commo|tions of the populace. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, nothing appears to have been &s;o practicable, or likely to be &s;o efficacious, as leaving, wherever he came, conci&s;e le&s;&s;ons of duty. The&s;e circum&s;tances at lea&s;t &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of compri&s;ing what he delivered within a &s;mall compa&s;s. In particular, his &s;ermon upon the mount ought always to be con&s;idered with a view to the&s;e ob&s;ervations. The que&s;tion is not, whether a fuller, a more accurate, a more &s;y&s;tematic, or a more argumentative di&s;|cour&s;e upon morals might not have been pronounced, but whether more could have been &s;aid in the &s;ame room, better adapted to the exigencies of the hearers, or better calculated for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ion. Seen in this light, it hath always appeared to me to be admirable. Dr. Lardner thought that this di&s;cour&s;e was made up of what Chri&s;t had &s;aid at different times, and upon different occa&s;ions, &s;everal of which occa|&s;ions are noticed in St. Luke's narrative. I can perceive no rea&s;on for this opinion. I
<PB N="55" REF="60">
believe that our Lord delivered this di&s;cour&s;e at one time and place, in the manner related by St. Matthew, and that he repeated the &s;ame rules and maxims at different times, as opportunity or occa&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ted; that they were often in his mouth, were repeated to different audiences, and in various con|ver&s;ations.</P>
<P>It is incidental to this mode of moral in|&s;truction, which proceeds not by proof but upon authority, not by di&s;qui&s;ition but by precept, that the rules will be conceived in ab&s;olute terms, leaving the application, and the di&s;tinctions that attend it, to the rea&s;on of the hearer. It is likewi&s;e to be expected, that they will be delivered in terms, by &s;o much the more forcible and energetic, as they have to encounter natural or general propen&s;ities. It is further al&s;o to be re|marked, that many of tho&s;e &s;trong in&s;tances, which appear in our Lord's &s;ermon, &s;uch as "If any man will &s;mite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o: If any man will &s;ue thee at the law, and take away
<PB N="56" REF="61">
thy coat, let him have thy cloke al&s;o: Who|&s;oever &s;hall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain;" though they appear in the form of &s;pecific precepts, are intended as de&s;criptive of di&s;po&s;ition and character. A &s;pecific compliance with the precepts would be of little value, but the di&s;po&s;ition which they inculcate is of the highe&s;t. He who &s;hould content him&s;elf with waiting for the occa&s;ion, and with literally ob&s;erv|ing the rule when the occa&s;ion offered, would do nothing, or wor&s;e than nothing; but he who con&s;iders the character and di&s;|po&s;ition which is hereby inculcated, and places that di&s;po&s;ition before him as the model to which he &s;hould bring his own, takes, perhaps, the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible method of improving the benevolence, and of calming and rectifying the vices of his temper.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that this di&s;po&s;ition is unat|tainable, I an&s;wer, &s;o is all perfection; ought therefore a morali&s;t to recommend imperfections? One excellency, however, of our Saviour's rules is, that they are
<PB N="57" REF="62">
either never mi&s;taken, or never &s;o mi&s;taken as to do harm. I could feign a hundred ca&s;es, in which the literal application of the rule, "of doing to others as we would that others &s;hould do unto us," might mi&s;lead us: but I never yet met with the man who was actually mi&s;led by it. Notwith&s;tand|ing that our Lord bid his followers "not to re&s;i&s;t evil," and "to forgive the enemy, who &s;hould tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t them, not till &s;even times but till &s;eventy times &s;even," the Chri&s;tian world has hitherto &s;uffered lit|tle by too much placability or forbearance. I would repeat once more, what has already been twice remarked, that the&s;e rules were de&s;igned to regulate per&s;onal conduct from per&s;onal motives, and for this purpo&s;e alone.</P>
<P>I think that the&s;e ob&s;ervations will a&s;&s;i&s;t us greatly in placing our Saviour's conduct, as a moral teacher, in a proper point of view; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that to deliver moral di&s;qui&s;itions was no part of his de&s;ign, to teach morality at all was only
<PB N="58" REF="63">
a &s;ubordinate part of it, his great bu&s;ine&s;s being to &s;upply, what was much more wanting than le&s;&s;ons of morality, &s;tronger moral &s;anctions, and clearer a&s;&s;urances of a future judgement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some appear to require in a religious &s;y&s;tem, or in the books which profe&s;s to deliver that &s;y&s;tem, mi|nute directions for every ca&s;e and occurrence that may ari&s;e. This, &s;ay they, is nece&s;&s;ary to render a revela|tion perfect, e&s;pecially one which has for its object the regulation of human conduct. Now, how prolix, and yet how incomplete and unavailing, &s;uch an attempt mu&s;t have been, is proved by one notable example: "The Indoo and Mu&s;&s;ulman religion are in&s;titutes of civil law, regulating the minute&s;t que&s;tions both of property, and of all que&s;tions which come under the cognizance of the magi&s;trate. And to what length de|tails: of this kind are nece&s;&s;arily carried, when once begun, may be under&s;tood from an anecdote of the Mu&s;&s;ulman code, which we have received from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authority, that not le&s;s than <HI>&s;eventy|five thou&s;and</HI> traditional precepts have been promulga|ted."

<P>From whence did the&s;e come? Whence had this man this wi&s;dom? Was our Savi|our, in fact, a well-in&s;tructed philo&s;opher, whil&s;t he is repre&s;ented to us as an illiterate pea&s;ant? Or &s;hall we &s;ay that &s;ome early Chri&s;tians of ta&s;te and education compo&s;ed
<PB N="60" REF="65">
the&s;e pieces, and a&s;cribed them to Chri&s;t? Be&s;ide all other incredibilities in this ac|count, I an&s;wer, with Dr. Jortin, that they <HI>could not</HI> do it. No &s;pecimens of compo&s;i|tion, which the Chri&s;tians of the fir&s;t cen|tury have left us, authorize us to believe that they were equal to the ta&s;k. And how little qualified the Jews, the countrymen and companions of Chri&s;t, were to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the undertaking, may be judged of from the traditions and writings of theirs which were the neare&s;t to that age. The whole collection of the Talmud is one continued proof, into what follies they fell whenever they left their Bible; and how little capable they were of furni&s;hing out &s;uch le&s;&s;ons as Chri&s;t delivered.</P>
<P>But there is &s;till another view, in which our Lord's di&s;cour&s;es de&s;erve to be con&s;i|dered; and that is, in their <HI>negative</HI> charac|ter, not in what they did, but in what they did not contain.

I. They exhibit no particular de&s;cription of the invi&s;ible world. The future happi|ne&s;s of the good, and the mi&s;ery of the bad, which is all we want to be a&s;&s;ured of, is directly and po&s;itively affirmed, and is re|pre&s;ented by metaphors and compari&s;ons, which were plainly intended as metaphors and compari&s;ons, and as nothing more. As to the re&s;t, a &s;olemn re&s;erve is maintained. The que&s;tion concerning the woman who had been married to &s;even brothers, "Who&s;e &s;hall &s;he be on the re&s;urrection?" was of a nature calculated to have drawn from Chri&s;t a more circum&s;tantial account of the &s;tate of the human &s;pecies in their future exi&s;t|ence. He cut &s;hort, however, the enquiry by an an&s;wer, which at once rebuked in|truding curio&s;ity, and was agreeable to the be&s;t apprehen&s;ions we are able to form upon the &s;ubject, viz. "That they who are accounted worthy of that re&s;urrection, &s;hall be as the angels of God in heaven." I lay a &s;tre&s;s upon this re&s;erve, becau&s;e it repels the &s;u&s;picion of enthu&s;ia&s;m; for enthu&s;ia&s;m is wont to expatiate upon the condition of

the departed, above all other &s;ubjects; and with a wild particularity. It is moreover a topic which is always li&s;tened to with greedine&s;s.

Place Chri&s;tianity, in this re&s;pect, by the &s;ide of all in&s;titutions which have been founded in the fanatici&s;m, either of their author, or of his fir&s;t followers: or rather compare, in this re&s;pect, Chri&s;tianity as it came from Chri&s;t, with the &s;ame religion after it fell into other hands; with the extravagant me|rit very &s;oon a&s;cribed to celibacy, &s;olitude, voluntary poverty; with the rigours of an a&s;cetic, and the vows of a mona&s;tic life; the hair &s;hirt, the watchings, the midnight prayers, the obmute&s;cence, the gloom and
<PB N="63" REF="68">
mortification, of religious orders, and of tho&s;e who a&s;pired to religious perfection.</P>
<P N="3">III. Our Saviour uttered no impa&s;&s;ioned devotion. There was no heat in his piety, or in the language in which he expre&s;&s;ed it; no vehement or rapturous ejaculations, no violent urgency in his prayers. The Lord's prayer is a model of calm devotion. His words in the garden are unaffected ex|pre&s;&s;ions, of a deep indeed, but &s;ober piety. He never appears to have been worked up into any thing like that elation, or that emotion of &s;pirits, which is occa&s;ionally ob|&s;erved in mo&s;t of tho&s;e, to whom the name of enthu&s;ia&s;t can in any degree be applied. I feel a re&s;pect for methodi&s;ts, becau&s;e I believe that there is to be found among&s;t them, much &s;incere piety, and availing, though not always well-informed, Chri&s;tia|nity: yet I never attended a meeting of theirs, but I came away with the reflection, how different what I heard was from what I read; I do not mean in doctrine, with
<PB N="64" REF="69">
which, at pre&s;ent, I have no concern, but in manner; how different from the calm|ne&s;s, the &s;obriety, the good &s;en&s;e, and, I may add, the &s;trength and authority, of our Lord's di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It is very u&s;ual with the human mind, to &s;ub&s;titute forwardne&s;s and fervency in a particular cau&s;e, for the merit of general and regular morality; and it is natural, and politic al&s;o, in the leader of a &s;ect or party, to encourage &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition in his fol|lowers. Chri&s;t did not overlook this turn of thought: yet, though avowedly placing him&s;elf at the head of a new in&s;titution, he notices it only to condemn it. "Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven: many will &s;ay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name? and in thy name have ca&s;t out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? and then will I profe&s;s
<PB N="65" REF="70">
unto you, I never knew you, depart from me, <HI>ye that work iniquity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 21, 22.</NOTE>." So far was the author of Chri&s;tianity from courting the at|tachment of his followers by any &s;acrifice of principle, or by a conde&s;cen&s;ion to the er|rors which even zeal in his &s;ervice might have in&s;pired! This was a proof both of &s;incerity and judgement.</P>
<P N="5">V. Nor, fifthly, did he fall in with any of the depraved fa&s;hions of his country, or with the natural bia&s;s of his own education. Bred up a Jew, under a religion extremely technical, in an age, and among&s;t a people, more tenacious of the ceremonies, than of any other part of that religion, he delivered an in&s;titution, containing le&s;s of ritual, and that more &s;imple, than is to be found in any religion, which ever prevailed among&s;t mankind. We have known, I do allow, examples of an enthu&s;ia&s;m, which has &s;wept away all external ordinances before it. But this &s;pirit certainly did not dictate our Sa|viour's conduct, either in his treatment of
<PB N="66" REF="71">
the religion of his country, or in the for|mation of his own in&s;titution. In both he di&s;played the &s;oundne&s;s and moderation of his judgement. He cen&s;ured an over&s;trained &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s, or perhaps an affectation of &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s, about the &s;abbath; but how did he cen&s;ure it? not by contemning or decrying the in&s;titution it&s;elf, but by de|claring that "the &s;abbath was made for man, not man for the &s;abbath;" that is to &s;ay, that the &s;abbath was to be &s;ubordinate to its purpo&s;e, and that that purpo&s;e was the real good of tho&s;e who were the &s;ub|jects of the law. The &s;ame concerning the nicety of &s;ome of the phari&s;ees, in paying tithes of the mo&s;t trifling articles, accom|panied with a neglect of ju&s;tice, fidelity, and mercy. He finds fault with them for mi&s;placing their anxiety. He does not &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of the law of tithes, or of their ob&s;ervance of it, but he a&s;&s;igns to each cla&s;s of duties its proper &s;tation in the &s;cale of moral importance. All this might be expected perhaps from a well-in&s;tructed, cool, and judicious philo&s;opher, but was
<PB N="67" REF="72">
not to be looked for from an illiterate Jew, certainly not from an impetuous enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Nothing could be more quibbling, than were the comments and expo&s;itions of the Jewi&s;h doctors, at that time; nothing &s;o puerile as their di&s;tinctions. Their eva|&s;ion of the fifth commandment, their expo|&s;ition of the law of oaths, are &s;pecimens of the bad ta&s;te in morals which then prevail|ed. Whereas in a numerous collection of our Saviour's apothegms, many of them re|ferring to &s;undry precepts of the Jewi&s;h law, there is not to be found one example of &s;ophi&s;try, or of fal&s;e &s;ubtlety, or of any thing approaching thereunto.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The national temper of the Jews was intolerant, narrow-minded, and ex|cluding. In Je&s;us, on the contrary, whether we regard his le&s;&s;ons or his example, we &s;ee not only benevolence, but benevolence the mo&s;t enlarged and comprehen&s;ive. In the parable of the good Samaritan, the very point of the &s;tory is, that the per&s;on re|lieved
<PB N="68" REF="73">
by him, was the national and reli|gious enemy of his benefactor. Our Lord declared the equity of the divine admini|&s;tration, when he told the Jews (what, pro|bably, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to hear) "That many &s;hould come from the ea&s;t and we&s;t, and &s;hould &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven, but that the children of the kingdom &s;houd be ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. viii. 11.</NOTE>." His reproof of the ha&s;ty zeal of his di&s;ciples, who would needs call down fire from heaven to re|venge an affront put upon their Ma&s;ter, &s;hews the lenity of his character, and of his religion; and his opinion of the manner in which the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable opponents ought to be treated, or at lea&s;t of the man|ner in which they ought not to be treated. The terms, in which his rebuke was con|veyed, de&s;erve to be noticed:&mdash;"Ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 55.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="8">VIII. La&s;tly, among&s;t the negative qualities
<PB N="69" REF="74">
of our religion, as it came out of the hands of its founder and his apo&s;tles, we may reckon its complete ab&s;traction from all views either of eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil po|licy; or, to meet a language much in fa&s;hion with &s;ome men, from the politics either of prie&s;ts or &s;tate&s;men. Chri&s;t's declaration, that "his kingdom was not of this world," recorded by John; his eva&s;ion of the que&s;|tion, whether it was lawful or not to give tribute unto Ce&s;ar, mentioned by the three other evangeli&s;ts; his reply to an application that was made to him, to interpo&s;e his au|thority in a que&s;tion of property, "Man, who made me a ruler or a judge over you?" a&s;cribed to him by St. Luke; his declining to exerci&s;e the office of a criminal judge in the ca&s;e of the woman taken in adultery, as related by John, are all intelligible &s;ignifica|tions of our Saviour's &s;entiments upon this head. And with re&s;pect to <HI>politics,</HI> in the u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of that word, or di&s;cu&s;&s;ions con|cerning different forms of government, Chri&s;tianity declines every que&s;tion upon the &s;ubject. Whil&s;t politicians are di&s;puting
<PB N="70" REF="75">
about monarchies, ari&s;tocracies, and repub|lics, the go&s;pel is alike applicable, u&s;eful, and friendly to them all; ina&s;much as, 1&s;t, it tends to make men virtuous, and as it is ea&s;ier to govern good men than bad men under any con&s;titution: as, 2dly, it &s;tates obedience to government in ordinary ca&s;es, to be not merely a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to force, but a duty of con&s;cience: as, 3dly, it induces di&s;po&s;itions favourable to public tranquillity, a Chri&s;tian's chief care being to pa&s;s quietly through this world to a better: as, 4thly, it prays for communities, and for the go|vernors of communities, of whatever de|&s;cription or denomination they be, with a &s;olicitude and fervency proportioned to the influence which they po&s;&s;e&s;s upon human happine&s;s. All which, in my opinion, is ju&s;t as it &s;hould be. Had there been more to be found in &s;cripture of a political nature, or convertible to political purpo&s;es, the wor&s;t u&s;e would have been made of it, on which|ever &s;ide it &s;eemed to lie.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we con&s;ider Chri&s;t as a
<PB N="71" REF="76">
moral teacher (remembring that this was only a &s;econdary part of his office; and that morality, by the nature of the &s;ubject, does not admit of di&s;covery, properly &s;o called); when we con&s;ider, either what he taught, or what he did not teach, either the &s;ub|&s;tance or the manner of his in&s;truction; his preference of &s;olid to popular virtues, of a character which is commonly de&s;pi&s;ed, to a character which is univer&s;ally extolled; his placing, in our licentious vices, the check in the right place, viz. upon the thoughts; his collecting of human duty into two well devi&s;ed rules, his repetition of the&s;e rules, the &s;tre&s;s he laid upon them, e&s;pecially in compari&s;on with po&s;itive duties, and his fixing thereby the &s;entiments of his fol|lowers; his exclu&s;ion of all regard to repu|tation in our devotion and alms, and, by parity of rea&s;on, in our other virtues: when we con&s;ider that his in&s;tructions were de|livered in a form calculated for impre&s;&s;ion, the preci&s;e purpo&s;e in his &s;ituation to be con&s;ulted; and that they were illu&s;trated by parables, the choice and &s;tructure of which
<PB N="72" REF="77">
would have been admired in any compo&s;i|tion whatever: when we ob&s;erve him free from the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of enthu&s;ia&s;m, heat and vehemence in devotion, au&s;terity in in&s;titutions, and a wild particularity in the de&s;criptions of a future &s;tate; free al&s;o from the depravities of his age and country; without &s;uper&s;tition among&s;t the mo&s;t &s;u|per&s;titious of men, yet not decrying po|&s;itive di&s;tinctions or external ob&s;ervances, but &s;oberly recalling them to the principle of their e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to their place in the &s;cale of human duties; without &s;ophi&s;|try or trifling, amid&s;t teachers remarkable for nothing &s;o much, as frivolous &s;ubtleties and quibbling expo&s;itions; candid and li|beral in his judgement of the re&s;t of man|kind, although belonging to a people, who affected a &s;eparate claim to divine favour, and, in con&s;equence of that opinion, prone to uncharitablene&s;s, partiality, and re&s;tric|tion: when we find, in his religion, no &s;cheme of building up a hierarchy, or of mini&s;tring to the views of human govern|ments: in a word, when we compare Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
as it came from its author, either with other religions, or with it&s;elf in other hands, the mo&s;t reluctant under&s;tanding will be induced to acknowledge the probity, I think al&s;o, the good &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e, to whom it owes its origin; and that &s;ome regard is due to the te&s;timony of &s;uch men, when they declare their knowledge that the reli|gion proceeded from God; and when they appeal, for the truth of their a&s;&s;ertion, to miracles which they wrought, or which they &s;aw.</P>
<P>Perhaps the qualities which we ob&s;erve in the religion, may be thought to prove &s;omething more. They would have been extraordinary, had the religion come from any per&s;on; from the per&s;on, from whom it did come, they are exceedingly &s;o. What was Je&s;us in external appearance? a Jewi&s;h pea&s;ant, the &s;on of a carpenter, living with his father and mother in a remote province of Pale&s;tine, until the time that he pro|duced him&s;elf in his public character. He had no ma&s;ter to in&s;truct or prompt him.
<PB N="74" REF="79">
He had read no books, but the works of Mo&s;es and the prophets. He had vi&s;ited no poli&s;hed cities. He had received no le&s;&s;ons from Socrates or Plato; nothing to form in him a ta&s;te or judgement, different from that of the re&s;t of his countrymen, and of per&s;ons of the &s;ame rank of life with him|&s;elf. Suppo&s;ing it to be true, which it is not, that all his points of morality might be picked out of Greek and Roman writings, they were writings which <HI>he</HI> had never &s;een. Suppo&s;ing them to be no more, than what &s;ome or other had taught in various times and places, he could not collect them to|gether.</P>
<P>Who were his coadjutors in the under|taking, the per&s;ons into who&s;e hands the religion came after his death? a few fi&s;her|men upon the lake of Tiberias, per&s;ons ju&s;t as uneducated, and for the purpo&s;e of fram|ing rules of morality, as unpromi&s;ing as him&s;elf. Suppo&s;e the mi&s;&s;ion to be real, all this is accounted for; the un&s;uitablene&s;s of the authors to the production, of the characters
<PB N="75" REF="80">
to the undertaking, no longer &s;ur|pri&s;es us; but, without <HI>reality,</HI> it is very difficult to explain, how &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem &s;hould proceed from &s;uch per&s;ons. Chri&s;t was not like any other carpenter; the apo|&s;tles were not like any other fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P>But the &s;ubject is not exhau&s;ted by the&s;e ob&s;ervations. That portion of it, which is mo&s;t reducible to points of argument, has been &s;tated, and, I tru&s;t, truly. There are, however, &s;ome topics, of a more diffu&s;e na|ture, which yet de&s;erve to be propo&s;ed to the reader's attention.</P>
<P>The <HI>character of Chri&s;t</HI> is a part of the morality of the go&s;pel: one &s;trong ob&s;er|vation upon which is, that, neither as repre|&s;ented by his followers, nor as attacked by his enemies, is he charged with any per&s;onal vice. This remark is as old as Origen:&mdash;"Though innumerable lies and calumnies had been forged again&s;t the venerable Je&s;us, none had dared to charge him with an intemperance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or. Ep. Cel&s;. l. 3. num. 36. ed. Bened.</NOTE>."
<PB N="76" REF="81">
Not a reflection upon his moral character, not an imputation or &s;u&s;|picion of any offence again&s;t purity and cha&s;tity, appears for five hundred years after his birth. This faultle&s;&s;ne&s;s is more pecu|liar than we are apt to imagine. Some &s;tain pollutes the morals or the morality of almo&s;t every other teacher, and of every other law|giver<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See many in&s;tances collected by Grotiusde Ver. in the notes to his &s;econd book, p. 116. Pocock's edition.</NOTE>. Zeno the &s;toic, and Diogenes the cynic, fell into the foule&s;t impurities; of which al&s;o Socrates him&s;elf was more than &s;u&s;pected. Solon forbad unnatural crimes to &s;laves. Lycurgus tolerated theft as a part of education. Plato recommended a com|munity of women. Ari&s;totle maintained the general right of making war upon Bar|barians. The elder Cato was remarkable for the ill u&s;age of his &s;laves. The younger gave up the per&s;on of his wife. One loo&s;e principle is found in almo&s;t all the Pagan morali&s;ts; is di&s;tinctly, however, perceived in the writings of Plato, Xenophon, Cicero,
<PB N="77" REF="82">
Seneca, Epictetus, and that is, the allowing, and even the recommending to their di&s;ci|ples, a compliance with the religion, and with the religious rites, of every country into which they came. In &s;peaking of the founders of new in&s;titutions, we cannot forget Mahomet. His licentious tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions of his own licentious rules; his abu&s;e of the character which he a&s;&s;umed, and of the power which he had acquired, for the purpo&s;es of per&s;onal and privileged indul|gence; his avowed claim of a &s;pecial per|mi&s;&s;ion from heaven of unlimited &s;en&s;uality, is known to every reader, as it is confe&s;&s;ed by every writer, of the Mo&s;lem &s;tory.</P>
<P>Secondly, in the hi&s;tories which are left us of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, although very &s;hort, and although dealing in narrative, and not in ob&s;ervation or panegyric, we perceive, be|&s;ide the ab&s;ence of every appearance of vice, traces of devotion, humility, benignity, mild|ne&s;s, patience, prudence.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The candour of the writers of the New Te&s;tament.</HEAD>
<P>I MAKE this candour to con&s;i&s;t, in their putting down many pa&s;&s;ages, and noticing many circum&s;tances, which no writer what|ever was likely to have forged; and which no writer would have cho&s;en to appear in his book, who had been careful to pre&s;ent the &s;tory in the mo&s;t unexceptionable form, or who had thought him&s;elf at liberty to carve and mould the particulars of that &s;tory, according to his choice, or according to his judgement of the effect.</P>
<P>A &s;trong and well-known example of the fairne&s;s of the evangeli&s;ts, offers it&s;elf in their account of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, name|ly, in their unanimou&s;ly &s;tating, that, after he was ri&s;en, he appeared to his di&s;ciples alone. I do not mean, that they have u&s;ed
<PB N="86" REF="91">
the exclu&s;ive word <HI>alone;</HI> but that all the in&s;tances which they have recorded of his appearance, are in&s;tances of appearance to his di&s;ciples; that their rea&s;onings upon it, and allu&s;ions to it, are con&s;ined to this &s;up|po&s;ition; and that, by one of them, Peter is made to &s;ay, "Him God rai&s;ed up the third day, and &s;hewed him openly, not to all the people, but to witne&s;&s;es cho&s;en before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he ro&s;e from the dead <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 40, 41.</NOTE>." The commone&s;t under&s;tanding mu&s;t have perceived, that the hi&s;tory of the re&s;urrec|tion would have come with more advantage, if they had related that Je&s;us appeared, after he was ri&s;en, to his &s;oes as well as his friends, to the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, the Jewi&s;h coun|cil, and the Roman governor; or even if they had a&s;&s;erted the public appearance of Chri&s;t in general unqualified terms, with|out noticing, as they have done, the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples upon each occa&s;ion, and noticing it in &s;uch a manner as to lead their
<PB N="87" REF="92">
readers to &s;uppo&s;e that none but di&s;ciples were pre&s;ent. They <HI>could</HI> have repre&s;ented it one way as well as the other. And if their point had been, to have the religion believed, whether true or fal&s;e; if they had fabricated the &s;tory ab initio, or if they had been di&s;|po&s;ed, either to have delivered their te&s;timony as witne&s;&s;es, or to have worked up their mate|rials and information as hi&s;torians, in &s;uch a manner as to render their narrative as &s;pe|cious and unobjectionable as they could; in a word, if they had thought of any thing but of the truth of the ca&s;e, as they under|&s;tood and believed it; they would, in their account of Chri&s;t's &s;everal appearances after his re&s;urrection, at lea&s;t have omitted this re&s;triction. At this di&s;tance of time, the account as we have it, is perhaps more cre|dible than it would have been the other way; becau&s;e this manife&s;tation of the hi&s;torian's candour, is of more advantage to their te&s;|timony, than the difference in the circum|&s;tances of the account would have been to the nature of the evidence. But this is an effect which the evangeli&s;ts would not fore&s;ee;
<PB N="88" REF="93">
and I think that it was by no means the ca&s;e at the time when the books were compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon has argued for the genuine|ne&s;s of the Koran, from the confe&s;&s;ions which it contains, to the apparent di&s;ad|vantage of the Mahometan cau&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ix. c. 50. note 96.</NOTE>. The &s;ame defence vindicates the genuinene&s;s of our go&s;pels, and without prejudice to the cau&s;e at all.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other in&s;tances in which the evangeli&s;ts hone&s;tly relate what, they mu&s;t have perceived, would make again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Of this kind is John the Bapti&s;t's me&s;&s;age, pre&s;erved by St. Matthew and St. Luke, (xi. 2. vii. 18.) "Now when John had heard, in the pri&s;on, the works of Chri&s;t, he &s;ent two of his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid unto him, Art thou he that &s;hould come, or look we

for another? To confe&s;s, &s;till more to &s;tate, that John the Bapti&s;t had his doubts con|cerning the character of Je&s;us, could not but afford a handle to cavil and objection. But truth, like hone&s;ty, neglects appear|ances. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation, perhaps, holds concerning the apo&s;tacy of Judas <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had once placed among&s;t the&s;e examples of fair conce&s;&s;ion, the remarkable words of St. Matthew, in his account of Chri&s;t's appearance upon the Galilean mountain: "and when they &s;aw him, they wor&s;hipped him, <HI>but &s;ome doubted</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xxviii. 17.</NOTE>." I have &s;ince, however, been convinced, by what is ob&s;erved concerning this pa&s;&s;age <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 177.</NOTE> in Dr. Town&s;end's di&s;cour&s;e upon the re&s;urrection, that the tran&s;action, as related by St. Matthew, was really this: "Chri&s;t appeared fir&s;t <HI>at a di&s;tance;</HI> the greater part of the company, the moment they &s;aw him, wor&s;hipped, but &s;ome, as yet, <HI>i. e.</HI> upon this fir&s;t di&s;tant view of his per&s;on, doubted; whereupon Chri&s;t <HI>came up</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">St. Matthew's words are, <GAP DESC="foreign">.

John vi. 66. "From that time many of his di&s;ciples went back, and walked no more with him." Was it the part of a writer, who dealt in &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;gui&s;e, to put down <HI>this</HI> anecdote?</P>
<P>Or this, which Matthew has pre&s;erved, (xiii. 58.) "He did not many mighty works there, becau&s;e of their unbelief."</P>
<P>Again, in the &s;ame evangeli&s;t (v. 17, 18.) "Think not that I am come to de&s;troy the law or the prophets; I am not come to de|&s;troy, but to fulfil; for, verily, I &s;ay unto you, till heaven and earth pa&s;s, one jot, or one tittle, &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law, till all be fulfilled." At the time the go&s;pels were written, the apparent tendency of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion was to dimini&s;h the au|thority of the Mo&s;aic code, and it was &s;o con&s;idered by the Jews them&s;elves. It is very improbable, therefore, that, without the con&s;traint of truth, Matthew &s;hould have a&s;cribed a &s;aying to Chri&s;t, which <HI>primo intuitu,</HI> militated with the judgement
<PB N="91" REF="96">
of the age in which his go&s;pel was written. Marcion thought this text &s;o objectionable, that he altered the words, &s;o as to invert the &s;en&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. vol. xv. p. 422.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Once more, Acts xxv. 19. "They brought none accu&s;ation again&s;t him, of &s;uch things, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, but had certain que&s;tions again&s;t him of their own &s;uper&s;ti|tion, and of one Je&s;us which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive." Nothing could be more in the character of a Roman governor than the&s;e words. But that is not preci&s;ely the point I am concerned with. A mere panegyri&s;t, or a di&s;hone&s;t narrator, would not have repre&s;ented his cau&s;e, or have made a great magi&s;trate repre&s;ent it, in this manner, <HI>i. e.</HI> in terms not a little di&s;paraging, and be&s;peaking on his part, much unconcern and indifference about the matter. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be re|peated of the &s;peech which is a&s;cribed to Gallio (Acts viii. 14.) "If it be a que&s;tion
<PB N="92" REF="97">
of words, and names, and of your law, look ye to it, for I will be no judge of &s;uch matters."</P>
<P>La&s;tly, where do we di&s;cern a &s;tronger mark of candour, or le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition to extol and magnify, than in the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ame hi&s;tory? in which the evangeli&s;t, after relating that Paul, upon his fir&s;t arrival at Rome, preached to the Jews from morning until evening, adds, "And &s;ome believed the things which were &s;poken, and &s;ome believed not."</P>
<P>The following, I think, are pa&s;&s;ages, which were very unlikely to have pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the mind of a forger or a fabuli&s;t.</P>
<P>Matt. xxi. 21. "Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye &s;hall not only do this, which is done unto the fig-tree, but al&s;o, if ye &s;hall &s;ay unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou ca&s;t into the

&s;ea, it &s;hall be done; all things what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k in prayer, believing, it &s;hall be done <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o xvii. 20. Luke xvii. 6.</NOTE>." It appears to me very improbable, that the&s;e words &s;hould have been put into Chri&s;t's mouth, if he had not actually &s;poken them. The term "faith," as here u&s;ed, is perhaps rightly interpreted of con|&s;idence in that internal notice, by which the apo&s;tles were admoni&s;hed of their power to perform any particular miracle. And this expo&s;ition renders the &s;en&s;e of the text more ea&s;y. But the words, undoubtedly, in their obvious con&s;truction, carry with them a difficulty, which no writer would have brought upon him&s;elf officiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Luke ix. 59. "And he &s;aid unto an|other, follow me; but he &s;aid, Lord, &s;uffer me, fir&s;t, to go and bury my father. Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o Mat. viii. 21.</NOTE>." This an&s;wer, though very expre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="94" REF="99">
of the tran&s;cendent importance of religious concerns, was apparently har&s;h and repul&s;ive; and &s;uch as would not have been made for Chri&s;t, if he had not really u&s;ed it. At lea&s;t, &s;ome other in&s;tance would have been cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;age, I, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, think impo&s;&s;ible to have been the production of artifice, or of a cold forgery:&mdash;"But I &s;ay unto you, that who&s;oever is angry with his brother, without a cau&s;e, &s;hall be in danger of the judgement; and who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay to his brother, Raca, &s;hall be in danger of the council; but who|&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay, thou fool, &s;hall be in dan|ger of hell-&s;ire (Gehennae)." Mat. v. 22. It is emphatic, cogent, and well calculated for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ion; but is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition of art or warine&s;s on the part of the relator.</P>
<P>The &s;hort reply of our Lord to Mary Magdalen after his re&s;urrection (John xx. 16, 17.) "Touch me not, for I am not
<PB N="95" REF="100">
yet a&s;cended unto my Father," in my opi|nion, mu&s;t have been founded in a refer|ence or allu&s;ion to &s;ome prior conver&s;ation, for the want of knowing which, his mean|ing is hidden from us. This very ob&s;curity, however, is a proof of genuinene&s;s. No one would have forged &s;uch an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>John vi. The whole of the conver&s;ation, recorded in this chapter, is, in the highe&s;t degree, unlikely to be fabricated, e&s;pecially the part of our Saviour's reply between the fiftieth and the fifty-eighth ver&s;e. I need only put down the fir&s;t &s;entence, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he &s;hall live for ever; and the bread that I will give him is my fle&s;h, which I will give for the life of the world." Without calling in que&s;tion the expo&s;itions that have been given of this pa&s;&s;age, we may be permit|ted to &s;ay, that it labours under an ob&s;cu|rity, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe that any one, who made &s;peeches for the per&s;ons of his narrative, would have voluntarily involved
<PB N="96" REF="101">
them. That this di&s;cour&s;e was ob|&s;cure even at the time, is confe&s;&s;ed by the writer who has pre&s;erved it, when he tells us at the conclu&s;ion, that many of our Lord's di&s;ciples, when they had heard this, &s;aid, "This is a hard &s;aying, who can bear it?"</P>
<P>Chri&s;t's taking of a young child, and placing it in the mid&s;t of his contentious di&s;ciples (Mat. xviii. 2.), though as deci|&s;ive a proof, as any could be, of the benig|nity of his temper, and very expre&s;&s;ive of the character of the religion which he wi&s;h|ed to inculcate, was not by any means an obvious thought. Nor am I acquainted with any thing in any ancient writing which re&s;embles it.</P>
<P>The account of the in&s;titution of the Euchari&s;t bears &s;trong internal marks of genuinene&s;s. If it had been feigned, it would have been more full. It would have come nearer to the actual mode of cele|brating the rite, as that mode obtained very
<PB N="97" REF="102">
early in Chri&s;tian churches; and it would have been more formal than it is. In the forged piece, called the apo&s;tolic con&s;titu|tions, the apo&s;tles are made to enjoin many parts of the ritual, which was in u&s;e in the &s;econd and third centuries, with as much particularity, as a modern rubric could have done. Whereas, in the hi&s;tory of the Lord's &s;upper, as we read it in St. Matthew's go&s;|pel, there is not &s;o much as the command to repeat it. This, &s;urely, looks like unde|&s;ignedne&s;s. I think al&s;o that the difficulty, ari&s;ing from the conci&s;ene&s;s of Chri&s;t's ex|pre&s;&s;ion, "This is my body," would have been avoided in a made-up &s;tory. I allow that the explication of the&s;e words, given by Prote&s;tants, is &s;atisfactory; but it is de|duced from a diligent compari&s;on of the words in que&s;tion, with forms of expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in &s;cripture, and e&s;pecially by Chri&s;t, upon other occa&s;ions. No writer would, arbitrarily and unnece&s;&s;arily, have thus ca&s;t in his reader's way a difficulty, which, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, it required re&s;earch and erudi|tion to clear up.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="103">
Now it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the argument which is built upon the&s;e ex|amples, extends both to the authenticity of the books, and to the truth of the narrative: for it is improbable, that the forger of a hi&s;|tory in the name of another &s;hould have in|&s;erted &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages into it: and it is im|probable al&s;o, that the per&s;ons who&s;e names the books bear, &s;hould have fabricated &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages; or even have allowed them a place in their work, if they had not be|lieved them to expre&s;s the truth.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervation, therefore, of Dr. Lardner, the mo&s;t candid of all advo|cates, and the mo&s;t cautious of all enquirers, &s;eems to be well founded:&mdash;"Chri&s;tians are induced to believe the writers of the go&s;pel, by ob&s;erving the evidences of piety and probity that appear in their writings, in which there is no deceit or artifice, or cun|ning, or de&s;ign." "No remarks," as Dr. Beattie hath properly &s;aid, "are thrown in to anticipate objections; nothing of that caution, which never fails to di&s;tingui&s;h the
<PB N="99" REF="104">
te&s;timony of tho&s;e, who are con&s;cious of impo&s;ture; no endeavour to reconcile the reader's mind to what may be extraordi|nary in the narrative."</P>
<P>I beg leave to cite al&s;o another author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duchal, p. 97, 98.</NOTE>, who has well expre&s;&s;ed the reflection, which the examples now brought forward were intended to &s;ugge&s;t. "It doth not appear that ever it came into the mind of the&s;e writers, to con&s;ider how this or the other action would appear to mankind, or what objections might be rai&s;ed upon them. But, without at all attending to this, they lay the facts before you, at no pains to think whe|ther they would appear credible or not. If the reader will not believe their te&s;timony, there is no help for it: they tell the truth, and attend to nothing el&s;e. Surely this looks like &s;incerity, and that they publi&s;hed nothing to the world but what they believed them&s;elves."</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">

And &s;traightway the father of the child cried out, and &s;aid with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou mine un|belief." The &s;truggle in the father's heart, between &s;olicitude for the pre&s;ervation of his child, and a kind of involuntary di&s;|tru&s;t of Chri&s;t's power to heal him, is here expre&s;&s;ed with an air of reality, which could hardly be counter&s;eited.</P>
<P>Again, (Mat. xxi. 9.) the eagerne&s;s of the people to introduce Chri&s;t into Jeru&s;a|lem, and their demand, a &s;hort time after|wards, of his crucifixion, when he did not turn out what they expected him to be, &s;o far from affording matter of objection, re|pre&s;ents popular favour, in exact agreement

with nature and with experience, as the flux and reflux of a wave.</P>
<P>The rulers and Phari&s;ees rejecting Chri&s;t, whil&s;t many of the common people received him, was the effect, which, in the then &s;tate of Jewi&s;h prejudices, I &s;hould have expected. And the rea&s;on with which they, who rejected Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion, kept them|&s;elves in countenance, and with which al&s;o they an&s;wered the arguments of tho&s;e who favoured it, is preci&s;ely the rea&s;on, which &s;uch men u&s;ually give:&mdash;"Have any of the Scribes or Phari&s;ees believed on him?" John vii. 48.</P>
<P>In our Lord's conver&s;ation at the well, (John iv. 29.) Chri&s;t had &s;urpri&s;ed the Sa|maritan woman, with an allu&s;ion to a &s;ingle particular in her dome&s;tic &s;ituation, "Thou ha&s;t had five hu&s;bands, and he, whom thou now ha&s;t, is not thy hu&s;band." The wo|man, &s;oon after this, ran back to the city, and called out to her neighbours, "Come, &s;ee a man which told me <HI>all things</HI> that ever

I did." This exaggeration appears to me very natural; e&s;pecially in the hurried &s;tate of &s;pirits into which the woman may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been thrown.</P>
<P>The lawyer's &s;ubtl&s;ty in running a di&s;|tinction upon the word neighbour, in the precept "Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;ei&s;," was no le&s;s natural than our Sa|viour's an&s;wer was deci&s;ive and &s;atisfactory.

<P>The con&s;i&s;tency of St. Paul's character throughout the whole of his hi&s;tory (viz. the warmth and activity of his zeal, fir&s;t again&s;t, and then for Chri&s;tianity) carries with it very much of the appearance of truth.</P>

<P>St. Matthew, who was an inhabitant of Galilee, and did not join Chri&s;t's &s;ociety until &s;ome time after Chri&s;t had come into Galilee to preach, has given us very little of his hi&s;tory prior to that period. St. John, who had been converted before, and who wrote to &s;upply omi&s;&s;ions in the other go&s;|pels, relates &s;ome remarkable particulars, which had taken place before Chri&s;t left Judea to go into Galilee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hartley's Ob&s;. vol. ii. p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>St. Matthew (xv. 1.) has recorded the cavil of the Phari&s;ees again&s;t the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us, for eating "with unclean hands." St. Mark has al&s;o (vii. 1.) recorded the &s;ame tran&s;action (taken probably from St. Matthew), but with this addition, "For the

Phari&s;ees, and all the Jews, except they wa&s;h their hands often, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market, except they wa&s;h they eat not; and many other things there be which they have received to hold, as the wa&s;hing of cups and pots, brazen ve&s;&s;els, and of tables." Now St. Matthew was not only a Jew him&s;elf, but it is evident, from the whole &s;tructure of his go&s;pel, e&s;pecially from his numerous references to the Old Te&s;tament, that he wrote for Jewi&s;h readers. The above explanation therefore in him would have been unnatural, as not being wanted by the readers whom he addre&s;&s;ed. But in Mark, who, whatever u&s;e he might make of Matthew's go&s;pel, intended his own narrative for a general circulation, and who him&s;elf travelled to di&s;tant countries in the &s;ervice of the religion, it was properly added.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Identity of Chri&s;t's character.</HEAD>
<P>THE argument expre&s;&s;ed by this title I apply principally to the compari&s;on of the three fir&s;t go&s;pels with that of St. John. It is known to every reader of &s;cripture, that the pa&s;&s;ages of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory pre&s;erved by St. John, are, except his pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;ur|rection, for the mo&s;t part different from tho&s;e which are delivered by the other evangeli&s;ts. And I think the ancient account of this dif|ference to be the true one, viz. that St. John wrote <HI>after</HI> the re&s;t, and to &s;upply what he thought omi&s;&s;ions in their narratives, of which the principal were our Saviour's con|ferences with the Jews of Jeru&s;alem, and his di&s;cour&s;es to his apo&s;tles at his la&s;t &s;upper. But what I ob&s;erve in the compari&s;on of the&s;e &s;everal accounts is, that, although ac|tions and di&s;cour&s;es are a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t by
<PB N="106" REF="111">
St. John, in general different from what are given to him by the other evangeli&s;ts, yet, under this diver&s;ity, there is a &s;imilitude of <HI>manner,</HI> which indicates that the actions and di&s;cour&s;es proceeded from the &s;ame per&s;on. I &s;hould have laid little &s;tre&s;s upon a repeti|tion of actions &s;ub&s;tantially alike, or of di&s;|cour&s;es containing many of the &s;ame expre&s;|&s;ions, becau&s;e that is a &s;pecies of re&s;emblance, which would either belong to a true hi&s;tory, or might ea&s;ily be imitated in a fal&s;e one. Nor do I deny, that a dramatic writer is able to &s;u&s;tain propriety and di&s;tinction of character, through a great variety of &s;eparate incidents and &s;ituations. But the evan|geli&s;ts were not dramatic writers; nor po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents of dramatic writers; nor will it, I believe, be &s;u&s;pected, that they <HI>&s;tu|died</HI> uniformity of character, or ever thought of any &s;uch thing, in the per&s;on who was the &s;ubject of their hi&s;tories. Such uni|formity, if it exi&s;t, is on their part ca&s;ual; and if there be, as I contend there is, a per|ceptible re&s;emblance of <HI>manner,</HI> in pa&s;&s;ages, and between di&s;cour&s;es, which are in them&s;elves
<PB N="107" REF="112">
extremely di&s;tinct, and are delivered by hi&s;torians writing without any imitation of, or reference to one another, it affords a ju&s;t pre&s;umption, that the&s;e are, what they profe&s;s to be, the actions and the di&s;cour&s;es of the &s;ame real per&s;on; that the evangeli&s;ts wrote from fact, and not from imagination.</P>
<P>The article in which I find this agreement mo&s;t &s;trong, is in our Saviour's mode of teaching, and in that particular property of it, which con&s;i&s;ts in his drawing of his doc|trine from the occa&s;ion; or, which is nearly the &s;ame thing, rai&s;ing reflections from the objects and incidents before him, or turning a particular di&s;cour&s;e then pa&s;&s;ing into an opportunity of general in&s;truction.</P>
<P>It will be my bu&s;ine&s;s to point out this <HI>manner</HI> in the three fir&s;t evangeli&s;ts; and then to enquire, whether it do not appear al&s;o, in &s;everal examples of Chri&s;t's di&s;cour&s;es, pre&s;erved by St. John.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve in the following
<PB N="108" REF="113">
quotation, that the italic letter contains the reflection, the common letter the incident or occa&s;ion from which it &s;prings.</P>
<P>Mat. xii. 49, 50. "Then they &s;aid unto him, Behold thy mother and thy brethren &s;tand without, de&s;iring to &s;peak with thee.

<P>Mat. xvi. 5. "And when his di&s;ciples were come to the other &s;ide, they had for|gotten to take bread; then Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, <HI>Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Phari&s;ees, and of the Sadducees.</HI> And they rea&s;oned among them&s;elves, &s;aying, It is be|cau&s;e we have taken no bread.&mdash;How is it that ye do not under&s;tand, that I &s;pake it not to you concerning bread, that ye &s;hould be|ware of the leaven of the Phari&s;ees, and of

<P>Mat. xv. 1, 2. 10, 11. 17&mdash;20. "Then came to Je&s;us Scribes and Phari&s;ees, which were of Jeru&s;alem, &s;aying, Why do thy di&s;|ciples tran&s;gre&s;s the traditions of the elders? for they wa&s;h not their hands when they eat bread.&mdash;And he called the multitude, and &s;aid unto them, Hear and under&s;tand, <HI>not that which goeth into the mouth de&s;ileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, this de&s;ileth a man.</HI>&mdash;Then an&s;wered Peter, and &s;aid unto him, Declare unto us this pa|rable. And Je&s;us &s;aid, Are ye al&s;o yet with|out under&s;tanding? Do ye not yet under|&s;tand, that what&s;oever entereth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is ca&s;t out into the draught? but tho&s;e things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man; <HI>for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, fal&s;e witne&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="115">
<HI>bla&s;phemies; the&s;e are the things which de&s;ile a man,</HI> BUT TO EAT WITH UNWASHEN HANDS DEFILETH NOT A MAN." Our Saviour, upon this occa&s;ion, expatiates rather more at large than u&s;ual, and his di&s;cour&s;e al&s;o is more divided, but the concluding &s;en|tence brings back the whole train of thought to the incident in the &s;ir&s;t ver&s;e, viz. the ob|jurgatory que&s;tion of the Phari&s;ees, and renders it evident that the whole &s;prung from that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mark x. 13, 14, 15. "And they brought young children to him, that he &s;hould touch them, and his di&s;ciples rebuked tho&s;e that brought them; but when Je&s;us &s;aw it, he was much di&s;plea&s;ed, and &s;aid unto them, Suffer the little chiidren to come unto me, and forbid them not, <HI>for of &s;uch is the king|dom of God: verily I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever &s;hall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he &s;hall not enter therein."</HI></P>
<P>Mark i. 16, 17. "Now as he walked by the &s;ea of Galilee, he &s;aw Simon and

<P>Luke xi. 27. "And it came to pa&s;s as he &s;pake the&s;e things, a certain woman of the company lift up her voice and &s;aid unto him, Ble&s;&s;ed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou ha&s;t &s;ucked; but he &s;aid, <HI>Yea, rather ble&s;&s;ed are they, that hear the word of God, and keep it."</HI></P>
<P>Luke xiii. 1&mdash;5. "There were pre&s;ent at that &s;ea&s;on &s;ome that told him of the Ga|lileans, who&s;e blood Pilate had mingled with their &s;acri&s;ices; and Je&s;us an&s;wering, &s;aid unto them, <HI>Suppo&s;e ye that the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Galileans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things?

bread in the kingdom of God. Then &s;aid he unto him, <HI>A certain man made a great &s;upper, and bade many,"</HI> &amp;c. The parable is rather too long for in&s;ertion, but affords a &s;triking in&s;tance of Chri&s;t's <HI>manner</HI> of rai&s;ing a di&s;cour&s;e from the occa&s;ion. Ob&s;erve al&s;o in the &s;ame chapter, two other examples of advice, drawn from the circum&s;tances of the entertainment, and the behaviour of the gue&s;ts.</P>

<P>John vi. 26. "And when they had found him on the other &s;ide of the &s;ea, they &s;aid unto him, Rabbi, when came&s;t thou hither? Je&s;us an&s;wered them, and &s;aid, Verily I &s;ay unto you, ye &s;eek me not be|cau&s;e ye &s;aw the miracles, but becau&s;e ye did eat of the loaves and were filled. <HI>Labour not for the meat which peri&s;heth, but for that meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life, which the Son of man &s;hall give unto you."</HI></P>

John iv. 12. "Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who gave us the well, and drank thereof him&s;elf, and his children, and his cattle? Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto her (the woman of Samaria), Who&s;oever drinketh of this water &s;hall thir&s;t again, but <HI>who&s;oever drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t; but the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him a well of water, &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life."</HI></P>
<P>John iv. 31. "In the mean while, his di&s;ciples prayed him, &s;aying, Ma&s;ter, eat; but he &s;aid unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. Therefore &s;aid the di&s;ciples one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat? Je&s;us faith unto them, <HI>My meat is, to do the will of him that &s;ent me, and to fini&s;h his work."</HI></P>
<P>John ix. 1&mdash;5. "And as Je&s;us pa&s;&s;ed by, he &s;aw a man which was blind from his birth: and his di&s;ciples a&s;ked him, &s;aying, Who did &s;in, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? Je&s;us an&s;wered, Neither

<P>John ix. 35&mdash;40. "Je&s;us heard that they had ca&s;t him (the blind man above men|tioned) out; and when he had found him, he &s;aid unto him, Do&s;t thou believe on the Son of God? And he an&s;wered and &s;aid, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, Thou ha&s;t both &s;een him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he &s;aid, Lord, I believe; and he wor&s;hipped him. And Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>For judge|ment I am come into this world, that they which &s;ee not might &s;ee, and that they which &s;ee might be made blind."</HI></P>
<P>All that the reader has now to do, is to compare the &s;eries of examples taken from St. John, with the &s;eries of examples taken from the other evangeli&s;ts, and to judge
<PB N="115" REF="120">
whether there be not a vi&s;ible agreement of <HI>manner</HI> between them. In the above quoted pa&s;&s;ages, the occa&s;ion is &s;tated, as well as the reflection. They &s;eem therefore the mo&s;t proper for the purpo&s;e of our argument. A large, however, and curious collection has been made by different writers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newton on Daniel, p. 148, note <HI>a.</HI> Jortin Di&s;. p. 213. Bi&s;hop Law's Life of Chri&s;t.</NOTE>, of in&s;tances, in which it is extremely probable, that Chri&s;t &s;poke in allu&s;ion to &s;ome object, or &s;ome occa&s;ion then before him, though the mention of the occa&s;ion, or of the object, be omitted in the hi&s;tory. I only ob&s;erve that the&s;e in&s;tances are common to St. John's go&s;pel with the other three.</P>
<P>I conclude this article by remarking, that nothing of this <HI>manner</HI> is perceptible in the &s;peeches recorded in the Acts, or in any other but tho&s;e which are attributed to Chri&s;t, and that, in truth, it was a very un|likely manner for a forger or fabuli&s;t to at|tempt; and a manner very difficult for any
<PB N="116" REF="121">
writer to execute, if he had to &s;upply all the materials, both the incidents, and the ob&s;ervations upon them, out of his own head. A forger or a fabuli&s;t would have made for Chri&s;t, di&s;cour&s;es exhorting to virtue and di&s;&s;uading from vice in general terms. It would never have entered into the thoughts of either, to have crowded to|gether &s;uch a number of allu&s;ions, to time, place, and other little circum&s;tances, as oc|cur, for in&s;tance, in the &s;ermon on the mount, and which nothing but the actual pre&s;ence of the objects could have &s;ug|ge&s;ted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bi&s;hop Law's Life of Chri&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. There appears to me to exi&s;t an affi|nity between the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's placing a little child in the mid&s;t of his di&s;ciples, as related by the three fir&s;t evangeli&s;ts <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xviii. 1. Mark ix. 33. Luke ix. 46.</NOTE>, and the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's wa&s;hing his di&s;ciples' feet, as given by St. John <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">xiii. 3.</NOTE>. In the &s;tories
<PB N="117" REF="122">
them&s;elves there is no re&s;emblance. But the affinity, which I would point out, con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e two articles: fir&s;t, that both &s;tories denote the emulation which prevailed a|mong&s;t Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, and his own care and de&s;ire to correct it. The moral of both is the &s;ame. Secondly, that both &s;tories are &s;pecimens of the &s;ame manner of teaching, viz. by action; a mode of emblematic in|&s;truction extremely peculiar, and, in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, a&s;cribed, we &s;ee, to our Saviour, by the three fir&s;t evangeli&s;ts and by St. John, in in&s;tances totally unlike, and with|out the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their borrowing from each other.</P>
<P N="3">III. A &s;ingularity in Chri&s;t's language, which runs through all the evangeli&s;ts, and which is found in tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es of St. John, that have nothing &s;imilar to them in the other go&s;pels, is the appellation of "the &s;on of man;" and it is in all the evange|li&s;ts found under the peculiar circum&s;tance of being applied by Chri&s;t to him&s;elf, but
<PB N="118" REF="123">
of never being u&s;ed of him, or towards him, by any other per&s;on. It occurs &s;eventeen times in Matthew's go&s;pel, twelve times in Mark's, twenty-one times in Luke's, and eleven times in John's, and always with this re&s;triction.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A point of agreement in the conduct of Chri&s;t, as repre&s;ented by his different hi&s;torians, is that of his withdrawing him|&s;elf out of the way, whenever the beha|viour of the multitude indicated a di&s;po&s;ition to tumult.</P>
<P>Mat. xiv. 22. "And &s;traightway Je&s;us con&s;trained his di&s;ciples to get into a &s;hip, and to go before him unto the other &s;ide, while he &s;ent the multitude away. And when he had &s;ent the multitude away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray."</P>
<P>Luke v. 15, 16. "But &s;o much the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came together to hear, and
<PB N="119" REF="124">
to be healed by him of their infirmities: and he withdrew him&s;elf into the wilder|ne&s;s and prayed."</P>
<P>With the&s;e quotations compare the fol|lowing from St. John.</P>
<P>Chap. v. 13. "And he that was healed wi&s;t not who it was, for Je&s;us had con|veyed him&s;elf away, a multitude being in that place."</P>
<P>Chap. vi. 15. "When Je&s;us therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he de|parted again into a mountain by him&s;elf alone."</P>
<P>In this la&s;t in&s;tance St. John gives the motive of Chri&s;t's conduct, which is left un|unexplained by the other evangeli&s;ts, who have related the conduct it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="5">V. Another, and a more &s;ingular circum|&s;tance in Chri&s;t's mini&s;try, was the re&s;erve,
<PB N="120" REF="125">
which, for &s;ome time, and upon &s;ome occa|&s;ions at lea&s;t, he u&s;ed in declaring his own character, and his leaving it to be collected from his works rather than his profe&s;&s;ions. Ju&s;t rea&s;ons for this re&s;erve have been a&s;|&s;igned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Locke's Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Chri&s;tianity.</NOTE>. But it is not what one would have expected. We meet with it in Mat|thew's go&s;pel (xvi. 20), "Then charged he his di&s;ciples that they &s;hould tell no man that he was Je&s;us the Chri&s;t." Again, and upon a different occa&s;ion, in Mark's (iii. 4), "And unclean &s;pirits, when they &s;aw him, fell down before him, and cried, &s;aying, Thou art the Son of God; and he &s;traitly charged them that they &s;hould not make him known." Another in&s;tance &s;imilar to this la&s;t is recorded by St. Luke (iv. 41). What we thus find in the three evangeli&s;ts, appears al&s;o in a pa&s;&s;age of St. John (x. 24. 35). "Then came the Jews round about him, and &s;aid unto him, How long do&s;t thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Chri&s;t, tell us plainly." The occa&s;ion here was different
<PB N="121" REF="126">
from any of the re&s;t; and it was in|direct. We only di&s;cover Chri&s;t's conduct through the upbraidings of his adver&s;aries. But all this &s;trengthens the argument. I had rather at any time &s;urpri&s;e a coincidence in &s;ome oblique allu&s;ion, than read it in broad a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P N="6">VI. In our Lord's commerce with his di&s;ciples, one very ob&s;ervable particular is the difficulty which they found in under|&s;tanding him, when he &s;poke to them of the future part of his hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially of what related to his pa&s;&s;ion or re&s;urrection. This difficulty produced, as was natural, a wi&s;h in them to a&s;k for further explanation; from which, however, they appear to have been &s;ometimes kept back, by the fear of giving offence. All the&s;e circum&s;tances are di&s;tinctly noticed by Mark and Luke, upon the occa&s;ion of his informing them (pro|bably for the fir&s;t time) that the &s;on of man &s;hould be delivered into the hands of men. "They under&s;tood not," the evangeli&s;ts tell us, "this &s;aying, and it was hid from them,
<PB N="122" REF="127">
that they perceived it not; and they feared to a&s;k him of that &s;aying" (Luke ix. 45. Mark ix. 32). In St. John's go&s;pel we have, upon a different occa&s;ion, and in a different in&s;tance, the &s;ame difficulty of ap|prehen&s;ion, the &s;ame curio&s;ity, and the &s;ame re&s;traint:&mdash;"A little while, and ye &s;hall not &s;ee me, and again a little while, and ye &s;hall &s;ee me, becau&s;e I go to the Father. Then &s;aid &s;ome of his di&s;ciples among them|&s;elves, What is this that he &s;aith unto us? A little while and ye &s;hall not &s;ee me, and again a little while and ye &s;hall &s;ee me, and becau&s;e I go to the Father? They &s;aid, therefore, What is this that he &s;aith, a little while? We cannot tell what he &s;aith. Now Je&s;us knew that they were de&s;irous to a&s;k him, and &s;aid unto them," &amp;c. John xvi. 16 et &s;eq.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The meekne&s;s of Chri&s;t during his la&s;t &s;ufferings, which is con&s;picuous in the narratives of the three fir&s;t evangeli&s;ts, is pre&s;erved in that of St. John under &s;eparate examples. The an&s;wer given by him, in
<PB N="123" REF="128">
St. John <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xviii. 20.</NOTE>, when the high prie&s;t a&s;ked him of his di&s;ciples and his doctrine, "I &s;pake openly to the world, I ever taught in the &s;ynagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always re&s;ort, and in &s;ecret have I &s;aid nothing; why a&s;ke&s;t thou me? A&s;k them which heard me, what I have &s;aid unto them;" is very much of a piece with his reply to the armed party which &s;eized him, as we read it in St. Mark's go&s;pel, and in St. Luke's <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv. 48. Luke xxii. 52.</NOTE>: "Are ye come out as again&s;t a thief with &s;words and with &s;taves to take me? I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not." In both an&s;wers we di&s;cern the &s;ame tranquillity, the &s;ame reference to his public teaching. His mild expo&s;tulation with Pilate upon two &s;everal occa&s;ions, as related by St. John <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">xviii. 34. ix. 11.</NOTE>, is delivered with the &s;ame unruffled temper, as that which conducted him through the la&s;t &s;cene of his life, as de|&s;cribed by his other evangeli&s;ts. His an&s;wer,
<PB N="124" REF="129">
in St. John's go&s;pel, to the officer who &s;truck him with the palm of his hand, "If I have &s;poken evil, bear witne&s;s of the evil, but if well, why &s;mite&s;t thou me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xxviii. 23.</NOTE>?" was &s;uch an an&s;wer, as might have been looked for from the per&s;on, who, as he pro|ceeded to the place of execution, bid his companions (as we are told by St. Luke <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xxiii. 28.</NOTE>) weep not for him, but for them&s;elves, their po&s;terity, and their country; and who, whil&s;t he was &s;u&s;pended upon the cro&s;s, prayed for his murderers, "for they know not (&s;aid he) what they do." The urgency al&s;o of his judges and his pro&s;ecutors to ex|tort from him a defence to the accu&s;ation, and his unwillingne&s;s to make any (which was a peculiar circum&s;tance) appears in St. John's account, as well as in that of the other evangeli&s;ts <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See John xix. 9. Mat. xxvii. 14. Luke xxiii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are moreover two other corre&s;pon|dencies between St. John's hi&s;tory of the
<PB N="125" REF="130">
tran&s;action and theirs, of a kind &s;omewhat different from tho&s;e which we have been now mentioning.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t evangeli&s;ts record what is called our Saviour's agony, <HI>i. e.</HI> his devo|tion in the garden, immediately before he was apprehended; in which narrative they all make him pray, "that the cup might pa&s;s from him." This is the particular me|taphor which they all a&s;cribe to him. St. Matthew adds, "O my Father, if this cup may not pa&s;s away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xxvi. 42.</NOTE>." Now St. John does not give the &s;cene in the garden; but when Je&s;us was &s;eized, and &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance was attempted to be made by Peter, Je&s;us, according to his account, checked the at|tempt with this reply: "Put up thy &s;word into the &s;heath; the cup which my Father hath given me, &s;hall I not drink it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xviii. 11.</NOTE>?" This is &s;omething more than con&s;i&s;tency: it is coincidence: becau&s;e it is extremely
<PB N="126" REF="131">
natural, that Je&s;us, who, before he was ap|prehended, had been praying his Father, that "that cup might pa&s;s from him," yet with &s;uch a pious retractation of his reque&s;t, as to have added, "If this cup may not pa&s;s from me, thy will be done;" it was natural, I &s;ay, for the &s;ame per&s;on, when he actually was apprehended, to expre&s;s the re|&s;ignation to which he had already made up his thoughts, and to expre&s;s it in the form of &s;peech which he had before u&s;ed, "The cup which my Father hath given me, &s;hall I not drink it?" This is a coincidence be|tween writers, in who&s;e narratives there is no imitation, but great diver&s;ity.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;imilar corre&s;pondency is the following: Matthew and Mark make the charge, upon which our Lord was con|demned, to be a threat of de&s;troying the temple; "We heard him &s;ay, I will de&s;troy this temple, made with hands, and, within three days, I will build another made with|out hands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv. 5.</NOTE>;" but they neither of them inform
<PB N="127" REF="132">
us, upon what circum&s;tance this ca|lumny was founded. St. John, in the early part of his hi&s;tory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ii. 19.</NOTE>, &s;upplies us with this information; for he relates, that, upon our Lord's fir&s;t journey to Jeru&s;alem, when the Jews a&s;ked him, "What &s;ign &s;hewe&s;t thou unto us, &s;eeing that thou doe&s;t the&s;e things? He an&s;wered, De&s;troy this temple, and in three days I will rai&s;e it up." This agree|ment could hardly ari&s;e from any thing but the truth of the ca&s;e. From any care or de&s;ign in St. John, to make his narrative tally with the narratives of the other evan|geli&s;ts, it certainly did not ari&s;e, for no &s;uch de&s;ign appears, but the ab&s;ence of it.</P>
<P>A &s;trong, and more general in&s;tance of agreement, is the following. The three fir&s;t evangeli&s;ts have related the appointment of the twelve apo&s;tles <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. x. 1. Mark iii. 14. Luke vi. 12.</NOTE>; and have given a ca|talogue of their names in form. John, without ever mentioning the appointment, or giving the catalogue, &s;uppo&s;es, throughout
<PB N="128" REF="133">
his whole narrative, Chri&s;t to be accom|panied by a &s;elect party of di&s;ciples; the number of the&s;e to be twelve <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">vi. 7.</NOTE>; and when|ever he happens to notice any one as of that number <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xx. 24. vi. 71.</NOTE>, it is one included in the ca|talogue of the other evangeli&s;ts; and the names principally occurring in the cour&s;e of <HI>his</HI> hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t, are the names ex|tant in their li&s;t. This la&s;t agreement, which is of con&s;iderable moment, runs through every go&s;pel, and through every chapter of each.</P>
<P>All this be&s;peaks reality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Originality of our Saviour's character.</HEAD>
<P>THE Jews, whether right or wrong, had under&s;tood their prophecies to foretell the advent of a per&s;on, who, by &s;ome &s;uperna|tural a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould advance their nation to independence, and to a &s;upreme degree of &s;plendour and pro&s;perity. This was the reigning opinion and expectation of the times.</P>
<P>Now, had Je&s;us been an enthu&s;ia&s;t, it is probable that his enthu&s;ia&s;m would have fallen in with the popular delu&s;ion, and that, whil&s;t he gave him&s;elf out to be the per&s;on intended by the&s;e predictions, he would have a&s;&s;umed the character, to which they were univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;ed to relate.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">
Had he been an impo&s;tor, it was his bu|&s;ine&s;s to have flattered the prevailing hopes, becau&s;e the&s;e hopes were to be the in&s;tru|ments of his attraction and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But, what is better than conjectures, is the fact, that all the pretended Me&s;&s;iahs actually did &s;o. We learn from Jo&s;ephus that there were many of the&s;e. Some of them, it is probable, might be impo&s;tors, who thought that an advantage was to be taken of the &s;tate of public opinion. Others, perhaps, were enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who&s;e imagina|tion had been drawn to this particular ob|ject, by the language and &s;entiments which prevailed around them. But, whether im|po&s;tors or enthu&s;ia&s;ts, they concurred in producing them&s;elves in the character which their countrymen looked for, that is to &s;ay, as the re&s;torers and deliverers of the nation, in that &s;en&s;e in which re&s;tora|tion and deliverance were expected by the Jews.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="136">
Why therefore Je&s;us, if he was, like them, either an enthu&s;ia&s;t or impo&s;tor, did not pur&s;ue the &s;ame conduct as they did, in framing his character and preten&s;ions, it will be found difficult to explain. A mi&s;|&s;ion, the operation and benefit of which was to take place in another life, was a thing unthought of as the &s;ubject of the&s;e prophecies. That Je&s;us, coming to them as their Me&s;&s;iah, &s;hould come under a cha|racter totally different from that in which they expected him; &s;hould deviate from the general per&s;ua&s;ion, and deviate into preten&s;ions ab&s;olutely &s;ingular and original; appears to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the impu|tation of enthu&s;ia&s;m or impo&s;ture, both which, by their nature, I &s;hould expect, would, and both which, throughout the ex|perience which this very &s;ubject furni&s;hes, in fact <HI>have,</HI> followed the opinions that ob|tained at the time.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that Je&s;us, having tried the other plan, turned at length to this; I an&s;wer,

<P>ONE argument, which has been much re|lied upon (but not more than its ju&s;t weight de&s;erves), is the conformity of the facts, oc|ca&s;ionally mentioned or referred to in &s;crip|ture, with the &s;tate of things in tho&s;e times, as repre&s;ented by foreign and independent accounts. Which conformity proves, that the writers of the New Te&s;tament po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;pecies of local knowledge, which could only belong to an inhabitant of that coun|try, and to one living in that age. This argument, if well made out by examples, is very little &s;hort of proving the ab&s;olute genuinene&s;s of the writings. It carries them up to the age of the reputed authors, to an age, in which it mu&s;t have been difficult to impo&s;e upon the Chri&s;tian public, forgeries in the names of tho&s;e authors, and in which there is no evidence that any forgeries were attempted. It proves at lea&s;t, that the books,
<PB N="134" REF="139">
whoever were the authors of them, were compo&s;ed by per&s;ons living in the time and country in which the&s;e things were tran&s;|acted; and con&s;equently capable, by their &s;ituation, of being well informed of the facts which they relate. And the argument is &s;tronger, when applied to the New Te&s;ta|ment, than it is in the ca&s;e of almo&s;t any other writings, by rea&s;on of the mixed na|ture of the allu&s;ions which this book con|tains. The &s;cene of action is not confined to a &s;ingle country, but di&s;played in the greate&s;t cities of the Roman empire. Allu|&s;ions are made to the manners and prin|ciples of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews. This variety renders a forgery pro|portionably more difficult, e&s;pecially to wri|ters of a po&s;terior age. A Greek or Roman Chri&s;tian, who lived in the &s;econd or third century, would have been wanting in Jewi&s;h literature; a Jewi&s;h convert in tho&s;e ages would have been equally deficient in the knowledge of Greece and Rome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Michaelis's Introduction to the New Te&s;tament (Mar&s;h's tran&s;lation), c. ii. &s;ec. xi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="140">
This, however, is an argument which de|pends entirely upon an induction of parti|culars; and as, con&s;equently, it carries with it little force, without a view of the in|&s;tances upon which it is built, I have to re|que&s;t the reader's attention to a detail of ex|amples, di&s;tinctly and articulately propo&s;ed. In collecting the&s;e examples, I have done no more than epitomize the fir&s;t volume of the fir&s;t part of Dr. Lardner's credibility of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory. And I have brought the argument within its pre&s;ent compa&s;s, fir&s;t, by pa&s;&s;ing over &s;ome of his &s;ections in which the accordancy appeared to me le&s;s certain, or upon &s;ubjects not &s;ufficiently ap|propriate or circum&s;tantial; &s;econdly, by contracting every &s;ection into the fewe&s;t words po&s;&s;ible, contenting my&s;elf for the mo&s;t part with a mere <HI>appo&s;ition</HI> of pa&s;&s;ages; and, thirdly, by omitting many di&s;qui&s;itions, which, though learned and accurate, are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the under&s;tanding or verification of the argument.</P>
<P>The writer, principally made u&s;e of in
<PB N="136" REF="141">
the enquiry, is Jo&s;ephus. Jo&s;ephus was born at Jeru&s;alem four years after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion. He wrote his hi&s;tory of the Jewi&s;h war &s;ome time after the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, which happened in the year of our Lord &s;eventy, that is thirty-&s;even years after the a&s;cen&s;ion; and his hi&s;tory of the Jews he fini&s;hed in the year ninety|three, that is, &s;ixty years after the a&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the head of each article, I have re|ferred, by figures included in brackets, to the page of Dr. Lardner's volume, where the &s;ection, from which the abridgement is made, begins. The edition u&s;ed is that of 1741.</P>
<P N="1">I. (p. 14.) Mat. xi. 22. "When he (Jo&s;eph) heard, that Archelaus did reign in Judea, in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; notwith&s;tand|ing, being warned of God in a dream, he turned a&s;ide into the parts of Galilee."</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age it is a&s;&s;erted, that Archelaus
<PB N="137" REF="142">
&s;ucceeded Herod in Judea; and it is implied, that his power did <HI>not</HI> extend to Galilee.

<P>St. Matthew &s;ays, that Archelaus <HI>reigned,</HI> was <HI>king</HI> in Judea. Agreeably to this, we are informed by Jo&s;ephus, not only that Herod appointed Archelaus his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in Judea, but that he al&s;o appointed him with the title of king; and the Greek verb <GAP DESC="foreign">, which the evangeli&s;t u&s;es to de|note the government and rank of Arche|laus, is u&s;ed likewi&s;e by Jo&s;ephus <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Bell, lib. 1, c. 33, &s;ec. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The cruelty of Archelaus's character, which is not ob&s;curely intimated by the

evangeli&s;t, agrees with divers particulars in his hi&s;tory, pre&s;erved by Jo&s;ephus. "In the tenth year of his government, the chief of the Jews and Samaritans, not being able to endure his cruelty and tyranny, pre&s;ented complaints again&s;t him to Ce&s;ar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. 17, c. 13, &s;ec. 1.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>By the will of Herod the Great, and the decree of Augu&s;tus thereupon, his two &s;ons were appointed, one (Herod Antipas) te|trarch of Galilee and Peraea, and the other (Philip) tetrarch of Trachonitis and the neighbouring countries <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. 17, c. 8, &s;ec. 1.</NOTE>.

The difficulty, however, will not appear con|&s;iderable, when we recollect how common it was, in tho&s;e times, for the &s;ame per&s;on to bear two names: "Simon, which is called Peter; Lebbeus, who&s;e &s;ir|name is Thaddeus; Thomas, which is called Didymus; Simeon, who was called Niger; Saul, who was al&s;o called Paul." The &s;olution is rendered likewi&s;e ea&s;ier in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, by the con&s;ideration, that Herod the Great had children by &s;even or eight wives; that Jo&s;ephus mentions three of his &s;ons under the name of Herod; that it is neverthele&s;s highly probable, that the brothers bore &s;ome additional name, by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another.

<P>Again, Mark vi. 22. "And when the <HI>daughter of the &s;aid Herodias</HI> came in and danced&mdash;"</P>

<P N="4">IV. (p. 29.) Acts xii. 1. "Now, about that time, <HI>Herod the king</HI> &s;tretched forth his hands, to vex certain of the church." In the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ame chapter, Herod's <HI>death</HI> is repre&s;ented to have taken place, &s;oon after this per&s;ecution. The accuracy of our hi&s;torian, or, rather, the unmeditated coin|cidence, which truth of it's own accord pro|duces, is in this in&s;tance remarkable. There was no portion of time, for thirty years be|fore, nor <HI>ever</HI> afterwards, in which there was a <HI>king</HI> at Jeru&s;alem, a per&s;on exerci&s;ing that authority in Judea, or to whom that title could be applied, except the three la&s;t years of this Herod's life, within which pe|riod, the tran&s;action recorded in the Acts is &s;tated to have taken place. This prince was the grand&s;on of Herod the Great. In the Acts he appears under his family name
<PB N="142" REF="147">
of Herod; by Jo&s;ephus he is called Agrippa. For proof that he was a <HI>king,</HI> properly &s;o called, we have the te&s;timony of Jo&s;ephus in full and direct terms:&mdash;"Sending for him to his palace, Caligula put a crown upon his head, and appointed him king of the te|trarchie of Philip, intending al&s;o to give him the tetrarchie of Ly&s;anias <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ant. xviii. c. vii. &s;ec. 10.</NOTE>."

The reader will perceive the accordancy of the&s;e accounts in various particulars. The place (Ce&s;area), the &s;et day, the gorgeous dre&s;s, the acclamations of the a&s;&s;embly, the peculiar turn of the flattery, the reception of it, the &s;udden and critical incur&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e, are circum&s;tances noticed in both narratives.

<P N="7">VII. (p. 46.) "And after certain days, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Ce&s;area to &s;alute Fe&s;tus."

<P>Now how does the hi&s;tory of the age cor|re&s;pond with this account? The Agrippa here &s;poken of, was the &s;on of Herod Agrippa mentioned in the la&s;t article; but that he did not &s;ucceed to his father's king|dom, nor ever recovered Judea, which had been a part of it, we learn by the information of Jo&s;ephus, who relates of him, that, when

St. Paul addre&s;&s;es this per&s;on as a Jew: "King Agrippa, believe&s;t thou the prophets? I know that thou believe&s;t."

But what is more material to remark, becau&s;e it is more clo&s;e and cir|cum&s;tantial, is, that St. Luke, &s;peaking of the father, (xii. 1. 3.) calls him Herod the king, and gives an example of the exerci&s;e of his authority at Jeru&s;alem; &s;peaking of the &s;on, (xxv. 13.) he calls him king, but not of Judea; which di&s;tinction agrees cor|rectly with the hi&s;tory.</P>

That Annas was a per&s;on in an eminent &s;tation, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an authority co-ordinate with, or next to that of the High Prie&s;t properly &s;o called, may be inferred from St. John's go&s;pel, which, in the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's crucifixion, relates that "the &s;oldiers led him away to Annas fir&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xviii. 13.</NOTE>."

<P>This is a very curious, and a very im|portant coincidence.

<P>The examples here collected, will be &s;uf|ficient, I hope, to &s;atisfy us, that the writers
<PB N="182" REF="187">
of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory knew &s;omething of what they were writing about. The argu|ment is al&s;o &s;trengthened by the following con&s;iderations:</P>
<P N="1">I. That the&s;e agreements appear, not only in articles of public hi&s;tory, but, &s;ometimes, in minute, recondite, and very peculiar cir|cum&s;tances, in which, of all others, a forger is mo&s;t likely to have been found tripping.</P>
<P N="2">II.

<P N="3">III. That there appears, in the writers of
<PB N="183" REF="188">
the New Te&s;tament, a knowledge of the affairs of tho&s;e times, which we do not find in authors of later ages. In particular, many of the Chri&s;tian writers of the &s;econd and third centuries, and of the following ages, had fal&s;e notions concerning the &s;tate of Judea, between the nativity of Je&s;us and the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. part i. vol. ii. p. 960.</NOTE>.

<P>Amid&s;t &s;o many conformities, we are not to wonder that we meet with &s;ome difficul|ties. The principal of the&s;e I will put down, together with the &s;olutions which they have received.

For the hi&s;torical proofs of my a&s;&s;ertions, and for the Greek critici&s;ms upon which &s;ome of them are founded, I refer the reader to the &s;econd volume of the fir&s;t part of Dr. Lardner's large work.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="184" REF="189">
I. The taxing, during which Je&s;us was born, was "fir&s;t made," as we read, accord|ing to our tran&s;lation, in St. Luke, "whil&s;t Cyrenius was governor of Syria <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. ii. ver. 2.</NOTE>." Now it turns out, that Cyrenius was not governor of Syria until twelve, or, at the &s;oone&s;t, ten years after the birth of Chri&s;t; and that a taxing, cen&s;us, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, was made in Judea in the beginning of his government. The charge, therefore, brought again&s;t the evangeli&s;t is, that, intending to refer to this taxing, he has mi&s;placed the date of it, by an error of ten or twelve years.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the accu&s;ation is found in his u&s;ing the word "fir&s;t"&mdash;"And this taxing was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> made;" for, according to the mi&s;take imputed to the evangeli&s;t, this word could have no &s;ignification whatever: it could have had no place in his narrative; becau&s;e, let it relate to what it will, taxing, cen&s;us, enrollment, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, it imports that the writer had more than one of the&s;e
<PB N="185" REF="190">
in contemplation. It acquits him therefore of the charge, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, of his knowing only of the taxing in the beginning of Cyrenius's go|vernment. And if the evangeli&s;t knew, which this word proves that he did, of &s;ome other taxing be&s;ide that, it is too much, for the &s;ake of convicting him of a mi&s;take, to lay it down as certain, that he intended to refer to <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;entence in St. Luke may be con|&s;trued thus: "This was the fir&s;t a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment (or enrollment) of Cyrenius, governor of Syria <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the word which we render "fir&s;t" be rendered "before," which it has been &s;trongly contended that the Greek idiom allows of, the whole difficulty vani&s;hes, for then the pa&s;&s;age would be&mdash;"Now this taxing was made before Cyrenius was governor of Syria;" which corre&s;ponds with the chronology. But I rather choo&s;e to argue, that, however the word "fir&s;t" be rendered, to give it a meaning at all, it militates with the objec|tion. In this I think there can be no mi&s;take.</NOTE>;" the words "governor of Syria" being u&s;ed after the name of Cyrenius as his
<PB N="186" REF="191">
addition or title. And this title, belonging to him at the time of writing the account, was naturally enough &s;ubjoined to his name, though acquired after the tran&s;action which the account de&s;cribes. A modern writer, who was not very exact in the choice of his expre&s;&s;ions, in relating the affairs of the Ea&s;t-Indies, might ea&s;ily &s;ay, that &s;uch a thing was done by <HI>Governor</HI> Ha&s;tings, though, in truth, the thing had been done by him before his advancement to the &s;ta|tion from which he received the name of governor. And this, as we contend, is pre|ci&s;ely the inaccuracy which has produced the difficulty in St. Luke.</P>
<P>At any rate, it appears from the form of the expre&s;&s;ion, that he had two taxings or enrollments in contemplation. And if Cy|renius had been &s;ent upon this bu&s;ine&s;s into Judea, before he became governor of Syria (again&s;t which &s;uppo&s;ition there is no proof, but rather external evidence of an enroll|ment going on about this time under &s;ome

This tran&s;action corre&s;ponds in the cour&s;e of the hi&s;tory with the time of Chri&s;t's birth. What is called a cen&s;us, and which we render taxing, was delivering upon oath an account of their property. This might be accompanied with an oath of fidelity, or might be mi&s;taken by Jo&s;ephus for it.</NOTE>), then the cen&s;us on all hands acknowledged to have been made by him in the beginning of his government, would form a &s;econd, &s;o as to occa&s;ion the other to be called the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Another chronological objection ari&s;es upon a date a&s;&s;igned in the beginning of the third chapter of St. Luke <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lard. part i. vol. ii. p. 768.</NOTE>. "Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cae&s;ar&mdash;Je&s;us <HI>began to be about thirty</HI> years of age;" for &s;uppo&s;ing Je&s;us to have been born, as St. Matthew, and St. Luke al&s;o him&s;elf, relates, in the time of Herod, he mu&s;t, according to the dates given in Jo|&s;ephus, and by the Roman hi&s;torians, have

been at lea&s;t thirty-one years of age in the fifteenth year of Tiberius. If he was born, as St. Matthew's narrative intimates, one or two years before Herod's death, he would have been thirty-two, or thirty-three years old, at that time.</P>
<P>This is the difficulty: the &s;olution turns upon an alteration in the con&s;truction of the Greek.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Unde&s;igned Coincidences.</HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN the letters which bear the name of St. Paul in our collection, and his hi&s;tory in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, there exi&s;t many notes of corre&s;pondency. The &s;imple peru&s;al of the writings is &s;ufficient to prove, that neither the hi&s;tory was taken from the letters, nor the letters from the hi&s;tory. And the <HI>unde&s;ignedne&s;s</HI> of the agree|ments (which unde&s;ignedne&s;s is gathered from their latency, their minutene&s;s, their obliquity, the &s;uitablene&s;s of the circum|&s;tances in which they con&s;i&s;t, to the places in which tho&s;e circum&s;tances occur, and the circuitous references by which they are traced out) demon&s;trates that they have not been produced by meditation, or by any fraudulent contrivance. But coincidences, from which the&s;e cau&s;es are excluded, and
<PB N="196" REF="201">
which are too clo&s;e and numerous to be ac|counted for by accidental concurrences of fiction, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have truth for their foundation.</P>
<P>This argument appeared to my mind of &s;o much value (e&s;pecially for its a&s;&s;uming nothing be&s;ide the exi&s;tence of the books), that I have pur&s;ued it through St. Paul's thirteen epi&s;tles, in a work publi&s;hed by me four years ago under the title of Horae Pau|linae. I am &s;en&s;ible how feebly any argu|ment, which depends upon an induction of particulars, is repre&s;ented without examples. On which account, I wi&s;hed to have abridg|ed my own volume, in the manner in which I have treated Dr. Lardner's in the preced|ing chapter. But, upon making the at|tempt, I did not find it in my power to render the articles intelligible by fewer words than I have there u&s;ed. I mu&s;t be content, therefore, to refer the reader to the work it&s;elf. And I would particularly in|vite his attention to the ob&s;ervations which are made in it upon the three fir&s;t epi&s;tles.
<PB N="197" REF="202">
I per&s;uade my&s;elf that he will find the proofs, both of agreement and unde&s;igned|ne&s;s, &s;upplied by the&s;e epi&s;tles, &s;ufficient to &s;upport the conclu&s;ion which is there main|tained, in favour both of the genuinene&s;s of the writings, and the truth of the narrative.</P>
<P>It remains only, in this place, to point out how the argument <HI>bears</HI> upon the ge|neral que&s;tion of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, St. Paul in the&s;e letters affirms, in unequivocal terms, his own performance of miracles, and, what ought particularly to be remembered, <HI>"That miracles were the &s;igns of an apo&s;tle</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 18, 19. 2 Cor. xii. 12.</NOTE>." If this te&s;timony come from St. Paul's own hand, it is invaluable. And that it does &s;o, the argument before us fixes in my mind a firm a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>Secondly, it &s;hows that the &s;eries of ac|tion, repre&s;ented in the epi&s;tles of St. Paul, was real; which alone lays a foundation
<PB N="198" REF="203">
for the propo&s;ition, which forms the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t part of our pre&s;ent work, viz. that the original witne&s;&s;es of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory devoted them&s;elves to lives of toil, &s;uffering, and danger, in con&s;equence of their belief of the truth of that hi&s;tory, and for the &s;ake of communicating the know|ledge of it to others.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it proves that Luke, or whoever was the author of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles (for the argument does not depend upon the name of the author, though I know no rea&s;on for que&s;tioning it) was well acquaint|ed with St. Paul's hi&s;tory; and that he pro|bably was, what he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be, a companion of St. Paul's travels: which, if true, e&s;tabli&s;hes, in a con&s;iderable degree, the credit even of his go&s;pel, becau&s;e it &s;hews, that the writer, from his time, &s;itua|tion, and connections, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed opportuni|ties of informing him&s;elf truly concerning the tran&s;actions which he relates. I have little difficulty in applying to the Go&s;pel of St. Luke what is proved concerning the
<PB N="199" REF="204">
Acts of the Apo&s;tles, con&s;idering them as two parts of the &s;ame hi&s;tory; for, though there are in&s;tances of <HI>&s;econd</HI> parts being for|geries, I know none where the &s;econd part is genuine, and the fir&s;t not &s;o.</P>
<P>I will only ob&s;erve, as a &s;equel of the argument, though not noticed in my work, the remarkable &s;imilitude between the &s;tyle of St. John's go&s;pel, and of St. John's fir&s;t epi&s;tle. The &s;tyle of St. John's is not at all the &s;tyle of St. Paul's epi&s;tles, though both are very &s;ingular; nor is it the &s;tyle of St. James's or of St. Peter's epi&s;tle: but it bears a re&s;emblance to the &s;tyle of the go&s;pel in|&s;cribed with St. John's name, &s;o far as that re&s;emblance can be expected to appear, which is not in &s;imple narrative, &s;o much as in reflections, and in the repre&s;entation of di&s;cour&s;es. Writings, &s;o circum&s;tanced, prove them&s;elves, and one another, to be genuine. This corre&s;pondency is the more valuable, as the epi&s;tle it&s;elf a&s;&s;erts, in St. John's manner indeed, but in terms &s;uffi|ciently explicit, the writer's per&s;onal knowledge
<PB N="200" REF="205">
of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory: "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have &s;een with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life, that which we have &s;een and heard, declare we unto you <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">C. i. v. 1. 3.</NOTE>."

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Hi&s;tory of the Re&s;urrection.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is a part of the evidence of Chri&s;tianity; but I do not know, whether the proper &s;trength of this pa&s;&s;age of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, or wherein its peculiar value, as a head of evi|dence, con&s;i&s;ts, be generally under&s;tood. It is not that, as a miracle, the re&s;urrection ought to be accounted a more deci&s;ive proof of &s;upernatural agency than other miracles are; it is not that, as it &s;tands in the Go|&s;pels, it is better atte&s;ted than &s;ome others; it is not, for either of the&s;e rea&s;ons, that more weight belongs to it than to other miracles, but for the following, viz. That it is completely certain, that the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and the fir&s;t teachers of Chri&s;tianity, a&s;&s;erted the fact. And this would have been certain, if the four go&s;pels had been lo&s;t, or never written. Every piece of &s;cripture recognizes
<PB N="202" REF="207">
the re&s;urrection. Every epi&s;tle of every apo&s;tle, every author contemporary with the apo&s;tles, of the age immediately &s;ucceeding the apo&s;tles, every writing from that age to the pre&s;ent, genuine or &s;purious, on the &s;ide of Chri&s;tianity or again&s;t it, con|cur in repre&s;enting the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t as an article of his hi&s;tory, received without doubt or di&s;agreement by all who called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, as alledged from the beginning by the propagators of the in&s;titu|tion, and alledged as the center of their te&s;|timony. Nothing, I apprehend, which a man does not him&s;elf &s;ee or hear, can be more certain to him than this point. I do not mean that nothing can be more certain than that Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the dead; but that nothing can be more certain, than that his apo&s;tles, and the fir&s;t teachers of Chri&s;|tianity, gave out that he did &s;o. In the other parts of the go&s;pel narrative, a que&s;tion may be made, whether the things, related of Chri&s;t, be the very things which the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t teachers of the religion delivered concerning him? And this que&s;tion depends
<PB N="203" REF="208">
a good deal upon the evidence we po&s;&s;e&s;s of the genuinene&s;s, or rather perhaps, of the antiquity, credit, and reception of the books. Upon the &s;ubject of the re&s;urrection, no &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e no &s;uch doubt can be entertained. The only points, which can enter into our con&s;ideration, are, whether the apo&s;tles knowingly publi&s;hed a fal&s;ehood, or whether they were them&s;elves deceived; whether either of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;i|tions be po&s;&s;ible. The fir&s;t, I think, is pretty generally given up. The nature of the un|dertaking, and of the men; the extreme unlikelihood that &s;uch men &s;hould engage in &s;uch a mea&s;ure as a <HI>&s;cheme;</HI> their per&s;onal toils and dangers and &s;ufferings in the cau&s;e; their appropriation of their whole time to the object; the warm and &s;eemingly unaf|fected zeal and earne&s;tne&s;s with which they profe&s;s their &s;incerity, exempt their memory from the &s;u&s;picion of impo&s;ture. The &s;o|lution more de&s;erving of notice, is that which would re&s;olve the conduct of the apo&s;tles into <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> which would cla&s;s the evidence of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection with
<PB N="204" REF="209">
the numerous &s;tories that are extant of the apparitions of dead men. There are cir|cum&s;tances in the narrative, as it is pre&s;erv|ed in our hi&s;tories, which de&s;troy this com|pari&s;on entirely. It was not one per&s;on, but many, who &s;aw him; they &s;aw him not only &s;eparately, but together, not only by night but by day, not at a di&s;tance but near, not once but &s;everal times; they not only &s;aw him, but touched him, conver&s;ed with him, eat with him, examined his per|&s;on to &s;atisfy their doubts. The&s;e particu|lars are deci&s;ive; but they &s;tand, I do ad|mit, upon the credit of our records. I would an&s;wer, therefore, the in&s;inuation of enthu|&s;ia&s;m, by a circum&s;tance which ari&s;es out of the nature of the thing; and the reality of which mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed by all, who al|low, what I believe is not denied, that the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, whether true or fal&s;e, was a&s;&s;erted by his di&s;ciples from the be|ginning: and that circum&s;tance is, the non|production of the dead body. It is related in the hi&s;tory, what indeed the &s;tory of the re&s;urrection nece&s;&s;arily implies, that the
<PB N="205" REF="210">
corp&s;e was mi&s;&s;ing out of the &s;epulchre: it is related al&s;o in the hi&s;tory, that the Jews reported that the followers of Chri&s;t had &s;tolen it away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"And this &s;aying," St. Matthew writes, "is commonly reported among&s;t the Jews until this day." (xxviii. 15.) The evangeli&s;t may be thought good au|thority as to this point, even by tho&s;e who do not admit his evidence in every other point: and this point is &s;uf|ficient to prove that the body was mi&s;&s;ing.
<P>It has al&s;o been rightly, I think, ob&s;erved by Dr. Town&s;end (Di&s;. upon the Re&s;. p. 126.), that the &s;tory of the guards carried collu&s;ion upon the face of it:&mdash;"His di&s;ciples came by night, and &s;tole him away, while we &s;lept." Men in their circum&s;tances would not have made &s;uch an acknowledgement of their neg|ligence, without previous a&s;&s;urances of protection and impunity.</P></NOTE>. And this account, though loaded with great improbabilities, &s;uch as the &s;ituation of the di&s;ciples, their fears for their own &s;afety at the time, the unlikeli|hood of their expecting to &s;ucceed, the dif|ficulty of actual &s;ucce&s;s <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"E&s;pecially at the full moon, the city full of peo|ple, many probably pa&s;&s;ing the whole night, as Je&s;us and his di&s;ciples had done, in the open air, the &s;epulchre &s;o near the city as to be now inclo&s;ed within the walls." Prie&s;tley on the Re&s;ur. p. 24.</NOTE>, and the inevitable
<PB N="206" REF="211">
con&s;equence of detection and failure, was, neverthele&s;s, the mo&s;t credible account that could be given of the matter. But it pro|ceeds entirely upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of fraud, as all the old objections did. What account can be given of the <HI>body,</HI> upon the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of enthu&s;ia&s;m? It is impo&s;&s;ible our Lord's followers could believe that he was ri&s;en from the dead, if his corp&s;e was lying before them. No enthu&s;ia&s;m ever reached to &s;uch a pitch of extravagancy as that: a &s;pirit may be an illu&s;ion, a body is a real thing; an object of &s;en&s;e, in which there can be no mi&s;take. All accounts of &s;pectres leave the body in the grave. And, although the body of Chri&s;t might be removed by <HI>fraud,</HI> and for the purpo&s;es of fraud, yet, without any &s;uch intention, and by &s;incere but deluded men, which is the repre&s;enta|tion of the apo&s;tolic character we are now examining, no &s;uch attempt could be made. The pre&s;ence and the ab&s;ence of the dead body are alike incon&s;i&s;tent with the hypo|the&s;is of enthu&s;ia&s;m: for if pre&s;ent, it mu&s;t have cured their enthu&s;ia&s;m at once; if ab&s;ent,
<PB N="207" REF="212">
fraud, not enthu&s;ia&s;m, mu&s;t have car|ried it away.</P>
<P>But further, if we admit upon the con|current te&s;timony of all the hi&s;tories, &s;o much of the account as &s;tates that the reli|gion of Je&s;us was &s;et up at Jeru&s;alem, and &s;et up with a&s;&s;erting, in the very place in which he had been buried, and a few days after he had been buried, his re&s;urrection out of the grave, it is evident that if his body could have been found, the Jews would have produced it, as the &s;horte&s;t and com|plete&s;t an&s;wer po&s;&s;ible to the whole &s;tory. The attempt of the apo&s;tles could not have &s;urvived this refutation a moment. If we al&s;o admit, upon the authority of St. Mat|thew, that the Jews were adverti&s;ed of the expectation of Chri&s;t's followers, and that they had taken due precaution in con&s;e|quence of this notice, and that the body was in marked and public cu&s;tody, the ob&s;erva|tion receives more force &s;till. For, notwith|&s;tanding their precaution, and although thus prepared and forewarned; when the &s;tory
<PB N="208" REF="213">
of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t came forth, as it immediately did; when it was publicly a&s;&s;erted by his di&s;ciples, and made the ground and ba&s;is of their preaching in his name, and collecting followers to his reli|gion, the Jews had not the body to pro|duce: but were obliged to meet the te&s;ti|mony of the apo&s;tles by an an&s;wer, not containing indeed any impo&s;&s;ibility in it&s;elf, but ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of their integrity; that is, in other words, incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, which would re&s;olve their conduct into enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>

<P>IN this argument, the fir&s;t con&s;ideration is the fact; in what degree, within what time, and to what extent, Chri&s;tianity ac|tually was propagated.</P>
<P>The accounts of the matter, which can be collected from our books, are as follow: A <HI>few days</HI> after Chri&s;t's di&s;appearance out of the world, we find an a&s;&s;embly of di&s;|ciples at Jeru&s;alem, to the number of "about one hundred and twenty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 5.</NOTE>;" which hundred and twenty were, probably, a little a&s;&s;ocia|tion of believers, met together, not merely as believers in Chri&s;t, but as per&s;onally con|nected with the apo&s;tles, and with one an|other. Whatever was the number of believers
<PB N="210" REF="215">
then in Jeru&s;alem, we have no rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;o &s;mall a company &s;hould a&s;&s;emble; for there is no proof that the followers of Chri&s;t were yet formed into a &s;ociety, that the &s;ociety was reduced into any order, that it was at this time even un|der&s;tood, that a new religion (in the &s;en&s;e which that term conveys to us) was to be &s;et up in the world, or how the profe&s;&s;ors of that religion were to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of mankind. The death of Chri&s;t had left, we may &s;uppo&s;e, the gene|rality of his di&s;ciples in great doubt, both as to what they were to do, and concerning what was to follow.</P>
<P>This meeting was held, as we have al|ready &s;aid, a few days after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen|&s;ion; for, ten days after that event was the day of penteco&s;t, when, as our hi&s;tory re|lates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 1.</NOTE>, upon a &s;ignal di&s;play of divine agency attending the per&s;ons of the apo&s;tles, there were added to the &s;ociety "about

But here, it is not, I think, to be taken, that the&s;e three thou&s;and were all converted by this &s;ingle miracle; but rather that many, who were before believers in Chri&s;t, became now pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity; that is to &s;ay, when they found that a religion was to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, a &s;ociety formed and &s;et up in the name of Chri&s;t, governed by his laws, avowing their belief in his mi&s;&s;ion, united among&s;t them&s;elves, and &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world, by vi&s;ible di&s;tinctions, in pur&s;uance of their former conviction, and by virtue of what they had heard and &s;een and known of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory, they publicly became members of it.</P>

both now and afterwards, who, although they believed in Chri&s;t, did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to join them&s;elves to this &s;ociety; or who waited to &s;ee what was likely to be|come of it. Gamaliel, who&s;e advice to the Jewi&s;h council is recorded Acts iv. 34, ap|pears to have been of this de&s;cription; per|haps Nicodemus, and perhaps al&s;o Jo&s;eph of Arimathea. This cla&s;s of men, their character and their rank, are likewi&s;e point|ed out by St. John, in the twelfth chapter of his go&s;pel: "Neverthele&s;s among the chief rulers al&s;o many believed on him; but becau&s;e of the Phari&s;ees they did not confe&s;s him, le&s;t they &s;hould be put out of the &s;ynagogue: for they loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God." Per|&s;ons &s;uch as the&s;e, might admit the miracles of Chri&s;t, without being immediately con|vinced that they were under obligation to make a public profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, at the ri&s;k of all that was dear to them in life, and even of life it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Be&s;ide tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e who re|jected and oppo&s;ed Chri&s;tianity, there were, in all probability, multitudes between both, neither perfect Chri&s;|tians, nor yet unbelievers. They had a favourable opi|nion of the go&s;pel, but wordly con&s;iderations made them unwilling to own it. There were many circum|&s;tances which inclined them to think that Chri&s;tianity was a divine revelation, but there were many inconve|niences which attended the open profe&s;&s;ion of it; and they could not find in them&s;elves courage enough to bear them, to di&s;oblige their friends and family, to ruin their fortunes, to lo&s;e their reputation, their liberty and their life, for the &s;ake of the new religion. Therefore they were willing to hope, that if they endeavoured to ob&s;erve the great precepts of morality, which Chri&s;t had repre&s;ented as the principal part, the &s;um and &s;ub|&s;tance of religion; if they thought honourably of the go&s;pel, if they offered no injury to the Chri&s;tians, if they did them all the &s;ervices that they could <HI>&s;afely</HI> perform, they were willing to hope that God would accept this, and that he would excu&s;e and forgive the re&s;t."

Chri&s;tianity, however, proceeded to in|crea&s;e in Jeru&s;alem by a progre&s;s equally rapid with its fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; for, in the next<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 14.</NOTE> chapter of our hi&s;tory, we read that "be|lievers were the more added to the Lord, <HI>multitudes</HI> both of men and women."

<PB N="214" REF="219">
this enlargement of the new &s;ociety appears in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the &s;ucceeding chapter, wherein we are told, that, "when the num|ber of the di&s;ciples was <HI>multiplied,</HI> there aro&s;e a murmuring of the Grecians again&s;t the Hebrews becau&s;e their widows were ne|glected <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts vi. 1.</NOTE>;" and, afterwards in the &s;ame chapter, it is declared expre&s;sly, that "the number of the di&s;ciples multiplied in Jeru|&s;alem greatly, and that a great company of the prie&s;ts were obedient to the faith."</P>
<P>This I call the fir&s;t period in the propa|gation of Chri&s;tianity.

Ben&s;on's Hi&s;t. of Chri&s;t. book i. p. 148.</NOTE>, to &s;omething more than one year after that event. During which term the preaching of Chri&s;tianity, &s;o far as our do|cuments inform us, was confined to the &s;ingle city of Jeru&s;alem. And how did it &s;ucceed there? The fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly which we

meet with of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, and that a few days after his removal from the world, con&s;i&s;ted of "one hundred and twenty." About a week after this "three thou&s;and were added" in one day; and the number of Chri&s;tians, publicly baptized, and public|ly a&s;&s;ociating together, were very &s;oon in|crea&s;ed to "five thou&s;and." "Multitudes both of men and women continued to be added:" "di&s;ciples multiplied greatly," and "many of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;thood, as well as others, became obedient to the faith;" and this within a &s;pace of le&s;s than two years from the commencement of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of a per&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t the church at Jeru&s;alem, the converts were driven from that city, and di&s;per&s;ed through|out the regions of Judea and Samaria <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 1.</NOTE>.

<PB N="216" REF="221">
The effect of this preaching comes after|wards to be noticed, where the hi&s;torian is led, in the cour&s;e of his narrative, to ob|&s;erve, that <HI>then (i. e.</HI> about three years <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ben&s;on, book i. p. 207.</NOTE> po&s;terior to this) "the churches had re&s;t throughout all Judea, and Galilee and Sa|maria, and were edi&s;ied, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t, were multiplied."

<P>Hitherto the preaching of the go&s;pel had been con&s;ined to Jews, to Jewi&s;h pro&s;elytes, and to Samaritans.

<P>It was not yet known to the apo&s;tles, that they were at liberty to propo&s;e the religion to mankind at large. That "my&s;tery," as St. Paul calls it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii. 3&mdash;6.</NOTE>, and as it then was, was revealed to Peter by an e&s;pecial miracle. It appears to have been <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ben&s;on, b. ii. p. 236.</NOTE> about &s;even years after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, that the go&s;pel was preached to the Gentiles of Ce&s;area. A year after this, a great multitude of Gentiles were converted at Antioch in Syria. The expre&s;|&s;ions employed by the hi&s;torian are the&s;e&mdash;"a great number believed, and turned to the Lord;" "much people was added unto the Lord;" "the apo&s;tles Barnabas and Paul taught much people <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts xi. 21. 24. 26.</NOTE>." Upon Herod's death, which happened in the next year <NOTE N="&Barline;" PLACE="foot">Ben&s;on, b. ii. p. 289.</NOTE>, it is ob&s;erved that "the word of God grew

Three years from this time, upon the preaching of Paul at Ico|nium, the metropolis of Lycaonia, "a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks be|lieved <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. xiv. 1.</NOTE>;" and afterwards, in the cour&s;e of this very progre&s;s, he is repre&s;ented as "making many di&s;ciples" at Derbe, a prin|cipal city in the &s;ame di&s;trict. Three years <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ben&s;on's Hi&s;t.

From A&s;ia the apo&s;tle pro|ceeded into Greece, where, &s;oon after his arrival in Macedonia, we find him at The&s;|&s;alonica; in which city "&s;ome of the Jews believed, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude <NOTE N="&Barline;" PLACE="foot">Ib. xvii. 4.</NOTE>." We meet al&s;o here with an
<PB N="219" REF="224">
accidental hint of the general progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ion, in the exclamation of the tumultuous Jews of The&s;&s;alonica, "that they, who had turned the world up&s;ide down, were come thither al&s;o <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 6.</NOTE>." At Berea, the next city at which St. Paul arrives, the hi&s;torian, who was pre&s;ent, informs us that <HI>"many</HI> of the Jews believed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. xvii. 12.</NOTE>." The next year and half of St. Paul's mini&s;try was &s;pent at Corinth. Of his &s;ucce&s;s in that city we receive the following intimations: "that <HI>many</HI> of the Corinthians believed and were baptized," and "that it was revealed to the apo&s;tle by Chri&s;t, that he had <HI>much</HI> people in the city<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. xviii. 8&mdash;10.</NOTE>." Within le&s;s than a year af|ter his departure from Corinth, and twenty|five <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ben&s;on, b. iii. p. 160.</NOTE> years after the a&s;cen&s;ion, St. Paul fixed his &s;tation at Ephe&s;us, for the &s;pace of two years <NOTE N="&Barline;" PLACE="foot">Acts xix. 10.</NOTE> and &s;omething more.

prevailed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xix. 20.</NOTE>." And at the conclu&s;ion of this period, we find Demetrius at the head of a party, who were alarmed by the progre&s;s of the religion, complaining, that "not only at Ephe&s;us, but al&s;o throughout all A&s;ia, (<HI>i. e.</HI> the province of Lydia, and the country ad|joining to Ephe&s;us) this Paul hath per&s;uaded and turned away much people <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. v. 26.</NOTE>." Be&s;ide the&s;e accounts, there occurs, incidentally, mention of converts at Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Cyprus, Cyrene, Macedonia, Phi|lippi.</P>
<P>This is the third period in the propaga|tion of Chri&s;tianity, &s;etting off in the &s;eventh year after the a&s;cen&s;ion, and ending at the twenty-eighth. Now, lay the&s;e three pe|riods together, and ob&s;erve how the pro|gre&s;s of the religion by the&s;e accounts is repre&s;ented. The in&s;titution, which pro|perly <HI>began</HI> only after its author's removal from the world, before the end of thirty years had &s;pread it&s;elf through Judea, Galilee,

and Samaria, almo&s;t all the numerous di&s;tricts of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, through Greece, and the i&s;lands of the Aegean Sea, the &s;ea coa&s;t of Africa, and had extended it&s;elf to Rome, and into Italy. At Antioch in Syria, at Joppa, Ephe&s;us, Corinth, The&s;&s;alonica, Berea, Iconium, Derbe, Antioch in Pi&s;idia, at Lydda, Saron, the number of converts is intimated by the expre&s;&s;ions "a great num|ber," great multitudes," "much people." Converts are mentioned, without any de|&s;ignation of their number <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;idering the extreme conci&s;ene&s;s of many parts of the hi&s;tory, the &s;ilence about the numbers of converts is no proof of their paucity; for at Philippi, no men|tion whatever is made of the number, yet St. Paul ad|dre&s;&s;ed an epi&s;tle to that church. The churches of Galatia, and the affairs of tho&s;e churches, were con&s;i|derable enough to be the &s;ubject of another letter, and of much of St. Paul's &s;olicitude, yet no account is pre|&s;erved in the hi&s;tory of his &s;ucce&s;s, or even of his preach|ing in that country, except the &s;light notice which the&s;e words convey:&mdash;"when they had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, they e&s;&s;ayed to go into Bythinia." Acts xvi. 6.</NOTE>, at Tyre, Ce&s;a|rea, Troas, Athens, Philippi, Ly&s;tra, Dama&s;cus.
<PB N="222" REF="227">
During all this time, Jeru&s;alem continued not only the centre of the mi&s;&s;ion, but a principal &s;eat of the religion; for when St. Paul returned thither, at the conclu&s;ion of the period of which we are now con&s;i|dering the accounts, the other apo&s;tles point|ed out to him, as a rea&s;on for his compliance with their advice, "how many thou&s;ands (myriads, ten thou&s;ands) there were in that city who believed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxi. 20.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Upon this ab&s;tract, and the writing from which it is drawn, the following ob&s;erva|tions &s;eem material to be made:</P>
<P N="1">I. That the account comes from a per&s;on, who was him&s;elf concerned in a portion of what he relates, and was contemporary with the whole of it; who vi&s;ited Jeru&s;alem, and frequented the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who had act|ed, and were acting, the chief parts in the tran&s;action. I lay down this point po&s;itively;
<PB N="223" REF="228">
for had the ancient atte&s;tations to this valuable record been le&s;s &s;atisfactory than they are, the unaffectedne&s;s and &s;implicity with which the author notices his pre&s;ence upon certain occa&s;ions, and the entire ab|&s;ence of art and de&s;ign from the&s;e notices, would have been &s;ufficient to per&s;uade my mind, that, whoever he was, he actually lived in the times, and occupied the &s;itua|tion, in which he repre&s;ents him&s;elf to be. When I &s;ay "whoever he was," I do not mean to ca&s;t a doubt upon the name, to which antiquity hath a&s;cribed the Acts of the Apo|&s;tles (for there is no cau&s;e, that I am ac|quainted with, for que&s;tioning it), but to ob|&s;erve, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, the time and &s;ituation of the author, is of more im|portance than his name; and that <HI>the&s;e</HI> ap|pear from the work it&s;elf, and in the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;picious form.</P>
<P N="2">II. That this account is a very <HI>incom|plete</HI> account of the preaching and propaga|tion of Chri&s;tianity; I mean, that, if what we read in the hi&s;tory be true, much more
<PB N="224" REF="229">
than what the hi&s;tory contains mu&s;t be true al&s;o. For, although the narrative from which our information is derived has been intitled the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, it is in fact a hi&s;tory of the twelve apo&s;tles, only during a &s;hort time of their continuing together at Jeru&s;alem; and even of this period the ac|count is very conci&s;e. The work afterwards con&s;i&s;ts of a few important pa&s;&s;ages of Pe|ter's mini&s;try, of the &s;peech and death of Stephen, of the preaching of Philip the dea|con; and the &s;equel of the volume, that is, two thirds of the whole, is taken up with the conver&s;ion, the travels, the di&s;cour&s;es and hi&s;tory of the new apo&s;tle Paul, in which hi&s;tory al&s;o large portions of time are often pa&s;&s;ed over with very &s;canty notice.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the account, &s;o far as it goes, is for this very rea&s;on more credible. Had it been the author's de&s;ign to have <HI>di&s;played</HI> the early progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, he would undoubtedly have collected, or, at lea&s;t, have &s;et forth, accounts of the preaching of the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, who cannot, without extreme
<PB N="225" REF="230">
improbability, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have re|mained &s;ilent and inactive, or not to have met with a &s;hare of that &s;ucce&s;s which at|tended their colleagues. To which may be added, as an ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame kind,</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the intimations of the number of converts, and of the &s;ucce&s;s of the preach|ing of the apo&s;tles, come out for the mo&s;t part <HI>incidentally;</HI> are drawn from the hi&s;to|rian by the occa&s;ion; &s;uch as the murmuring of the Grecian converts, the re&s;t from per|&s;ecution, Herod's death, the &s;ending of Bar|nabas to Antioch and Barnabas calling Paul to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Paul coming to a place and finding there di&s;ciples, the clamour of the Jews, the complaint of artificers intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of the popular religion, the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned to induce Paul to give &s;a|tisfaction to the Chri&s;tians of Jeru&s;alem. Had it not been for the&s;e occa&s;ions, it is probable that no notice whatever would have been taken of the number of converts, in &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ages in which that no|tice now appears. All this tends to remove
<PB N="226" REF="231">
the &s;u&s;picion of a de&s;ign to exaggerate or deceive.</P>
<P>PARALLEL TESTIMONIES with the hi&s;|tory, are the letters which have come down to us of St. Paul, and of the other apo&s;tles. Tho&s;e of St. Paul are addre&s;&s;ed to the churches of Corinth, Philippi, The&s;&s;alonica, the church of Galatia, and, if the in&s;cription be right, of Ephe&s;us, his mini&s;try at all which places is recorded in the hi&s;tory; to the church of Colo&s;&s;e, or rather to the churches of Colo&s;&s;e and Laodicea jointly, which he had not then vi&s;ited. They re|cognize by reference the churches of Judea, the churches of A&s;ia, and "all the churches of the Gentiles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. ii. 14.</NOTE>." In the epi&s;tle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 18, 19.</NOTE> to the Romans, the author is led to deliver a re|markable declaration, concerning the extent of his preaching, its efficacy, and the cau&s;e to which he a&s;cribes it, "to make the Gen|tiles obedient by word and deed, through mighty &s;igns and wonders, by the power of
<PB N="227" REF="232">
the Spirit of God; &s;o that from Jeru&s;alem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t." In the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 23.</NOTE>, we find an oblique, but very &s;trong &s;ignification, of the then general &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t as it appeared to St. Paul: "If ye continue in the faith, grounded and &s;ettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the go&s;pel, which ye have heard, and <HI>which was preached to every creature which is under heaven;"</HI> which go&s;pel, he had reminded them near the beginning <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. i. 6.</NOTE> of his letter, "was pre&s;ent with them <HI>as it was in all the world."</HI> The expre&s;&s;ions are hyperbolical; but they are hyperboles which could only be u&s;ed by a writer who entertained a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the &s;ubject. The fir&s;t epi&s;tle of Pe|ter acco&s;ts the Chri&s;tians di&s;per&s;ed through|out Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, A&s;ia and Bithynia.</P>
<P>It comes next to be con&s;idered, how far
<PB N="228" REF="233">
the&s;e accounts are confirmed, or followed up, by other evidence.</P>
<P>Tacitus, in delivering a relation, which has already been laid before the reader, of the fire which happened at Rome in the tenth year of Nero, which coincides with the thirtieth year after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, a&s;|&s;erts, that the emperor, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the rumours of having been him&s;elf the au|thor of the mi&s;chief, procured the Chri&s;tians to be accu&s;ed. Of which Chri&s;tians, thus brought into his narrative, the following is &s;o much of the hi&s;torian's account, as be|longs to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: "They had their denomination from Chri&s;tus, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was put to death as a criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate. This pernicious &s;uper&s;tition, though checked for a while, broke out again, and &s;pread not only over Judea, but reached the city al&s;o. At fir&s;t they only were apprehended, who confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that &s;ect; afterwards <HI>a va&s;t multitude</HI> were di&s;covered by them." This te&s;timony to the early propagation of
<PB N="229" REF="234">
Chri&s;tianity is extremely material. It is from an hi&s;torian of great reputation, living near the time; from a &s;tranger and an ene|my to the religion: and it joins immediately with the period through which the &s;crip|ture accounts extend. It e&s;tabli&s;hes the&s;e points, that the religion began at Jeru&s;alem, that it &s;pread throughout Judea, that it had reached Rome, and not only &s;o, but that it had there obtained a great number of con|verts. This was about &s;ix years after the time that St. Paul wrote his epi&s;tle to the Romans, and &s;omething more than two years after he arrived there him&s;elf&punc; The converts to the religion were then &s;o nume|rous at Rome, that of tho&s;e who were be|trayed by the information of the per&s;ons fir&s;t per&s;ecuted, a great multitude (multitudo in|gens) were di&s;covered and &s;eized.</P>
<P>It &s;eems probable, that the temporary check which Tacitus repre&s;ents Chri&s;tianity to have received (repre&s;&s;a in prae&s;ens) refer|red to the per&s;ecution at Jeru&s;alem, which followed the death of Stephen (Acts viii.);
<PB N="230" REF="235">
and which, by di&s;per&s;ing the converts, cau&s;ed the in&s;titution, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to di&s;appear. Its &s;econd eruption at the &s;ame place, and within a &s;hort time, has much in it of the character of truth. It was the firm|ne&s;s and per&s;everance of men who knew what they relied upon.</P>
<P>Next in order of time, and perhaps &s;upe|rior in importance, is the te&s;timony of Pliny the younger. Pliny was the Roman go|vernor of Pontus and Bithynia, two con&s;i|derable di&s;tricts in the northern part of A&s;ia Minor. The &s;ituation in which he found his province, led him to apply to the empe|ror (Trajan) for his direction as to the con|duct he was to hold towards the Chri&s;tians. The letter, in which this application is con|tained, was written not quite eighty years after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion. The pre&s;ident, in this letter, &s;tates the mea&s;ures he had already pur&s;ued, and then adds, as his rea&s;on for re|&s;orting to the emperor's coun&s;el and autho|rity, the following words:&mdash;"Su&s;pending all judicial proceedings, I have recour&s;e to
<PB N="231" REF="236">
you for advice; for it has appeared to me a matter highly de&s;erving con&s;ideration, e&s;pe|cially upon account of the great number of per&s;ons who are in danger of &s;uffering: for many of all ages, and of every rank, of both &s;exes likewi&s;e, are accu&s;ed, and will be ac|cu&s;ed. Nor has the contagion of this &s;u|per&s;tition &s;eized cities only, but the le&s;&s;er towns al&s;o, and the open country. Never|thele&s;s it &s;eemed to me that it may be re|&s;trained and corrected. It is certain that the temples, which were almo&s;t for&s;aken, begin to be more frequented; and the &s;acred &s;o|lemnities, after a long intermi&s;&s;ion, are re|vived. Victims, likewi&s;e, are everywhere (pa&s;&s;im) bought up; whereas, for &s;ome time, there were few to purcha&s;e them. Whence it is ea&s;y to imagine, what numbers of men might be reclaimed, if pardon were granted to tho&s;e that &s;hall repent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">C. Plin. Trajano Imp. lib. x. ep. xcvii.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It is obvious to ob&s;erve, that the pa&s;&s;age of Pliny's letter, here quoted, proves, not
<PB N="232" REF="237">
only that the Chri&s;tians in Pontus and Bi|thynia were now numerous, but that they had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted there for &s;ome con&s;iderable time. "It is certain (he &s;ays) that the tem|ples, which were almo&s;t for&s;aken (plainly a&s;cribing this de&s;ertion of the popular wor|&s;hip to the prevalency of Chri&s;tianity), be|gin to be more frequented; and the &s;acred &s;olemnities, after a <HI>long</HI> intermi&s;&s;ion, are re|vived." There are al&s;o two clau&s;es in the former part of the letter which indicate the &s;ame thing; one, in which he declares that he had "never been pre&s;ent at any trials of Chri&s;tians, and therefore knew not what was the u&s;ual &s;ubject of enquiry and puni&s;hment, or how far either was wont to be urged:" the &s;econd clau&s;e is the following, "others were named by an informer, who, at fir&s;t, confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and after|wards denied it; the re&s;t &s;aid, they had been Chri&s;tians, &s;ome three years ago, &s;ome longer, and &s;ome above twenty years." It is al&s;o apparent that Pliny &s;peaks of the Chri&s;tians as a de&s;cription of men well known to the per&s;on to whom he writes.
<PB N="233" REF="238">
His fir&s;t &s;entence concerning them is, "I have never been pre&s;ent at the trials of Chri&s;|tians." This mention of the name of Chri&s;|tians, without any preparatory explanation, &s;hews that it was a term familiar both to the writer of the letter, and the per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. Had it not been &s;o, Pliny would naturally have begun his letter by in|forming the emperor, that he had met with a certain &s;et of men in the province called Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Here then is a very &s;ignal evidence of the progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian religion in a &s;hort &s;pace. It was not four&s;core years after the crucifixion of Je&s;us when Pliny wrote this letter; nor &s;eventy years &s;ince the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us began to mention his name to the Gentile world. Bithynia and Pontus were at a great di&s;tance from Judea, the centre from which the religion &s;pread; yet in the&s;e provinces Chri&s;tianity had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and Chri&s;tians were now in &s;uch numbers as to lead the Roman governor to report to the emperor, that they were found, not only
<PB N="234" REF="239">
in cities, but in villages and in open coun|tries; of all ages, of every rank and condi|tion; that they abounded &s;o much as to have produced a vi&s;ible de&s;ertion of the temples, that bea&s;ts brought to market for victims had few purcha&s;ers, that the &s;acred &s;olemnities were much neglected; circum|&s;tances noted by Pliny, for the expre&s;s pur|po&s;e of &s;hewing to the emperor the effect and prevalency of the new in&s;titution.</P>
<P>No evidence remains, by which it can be proved that the Chri&s;tians were more nu|merous in Pontus and Bithynia than in other parts of the Roman empire; nor has any rea&s;on been offered to &s;hew why they &s;hould be &s;o. Chri&s;tianity did not begin in the&s;e countries, nor near them. I do not know, therefore, that we ought to confine the de|&s;cription in Pliny's letter to the &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e provinces, even if no other account of the &s;ame &s;ubject had come down to us; but, certainly, this letter may fairly be applied in aid and confirmation of the repre&s;entations given of the general &s;tate
<PB N="235" REF="240">
of Chri&s;tianity in the world, by Chri&s;tian writers of that and the next &s;ucceeding age.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tin Martyr, who wrote about thirty years after Pliny, and one hundred and &s;ix after the a&s;cen&s;ion, has the&s;e remarkable words: "There is not a nation, either of Greek or Barbarian, or of any other name, even of tho&s;e who wander in tribes, and live in tents, among&s;t whom prayers and thank&s;givings are not offered to the Father and Creator of the univer&s;e by the name of the crucified Je&s;us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dial. cum Tryph.</NOTE>." Tertullian, who comes about fifty years after Ju&s;tin, appeals to the governors of the Roman empire in the&s;e terms: "We were but of ye&s;terday, and we have filled your cities, i&s;lands, towns and boroughs, the camp, the &s;enate, and the fo|rum. They (the heathen adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity) lament, that every &s;ex, age and condition, and per&s;ons of every rank al&s;o, are converts to that name <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tertull. Apol. c. 37.</NOTE>." I do allow that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are loo&s;e, and
<PB N="236" REF="241">
may be called declamatory. But even de|clamation hath its bounds: this public boa&s;t|ing upon a &s;ubject, which mu&s;t be known to every reader, was not only u&s;ele&s;s but un|natural, unle&s;s the truth of the ca&s;e, in a con|&s;iderable degree, corre&s;ponded with the de|&s;cription; at lea&s;t unle&s;s it had been both true and notorious, that great multitudes of Chri&s;tians, of all ranks and orders, were to be found in mo&s;t parts of the Roman em|pire. The &s;ame Tertullian, in another pa&s;|&s;age, by way of &s;etting forth the exten&s;ive diffu&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, enumerates as be|longing to Chri&s;t, be&s;ide many other coun|tries, the "Moors and Gaetulians of Africa, the borders of Spain, &s;everal nations of France, and parts of Britain inacce&s;&s;ible to the Romans, the Sarmatians, Daci, Germans, and Scythians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad Jud. c. 7.</NOTE>:" and, which is more ma|terial than the extent of the in&s;titution, the <HI>number</HI> of Chri&s;tians in the &s;everal countries in which it prevailed, is thus expre&s;&s;ed by him: "Although &s;o great a multitude, that in

Clement Alexandrinus, who preceded Ter|tullian by a few years, introduces a compa|ri&s;on between the &s;ucce&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, and that of the mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;ophical in&s;titutions. "The philo&s;ophers were con|fined to Greece, and to their particular re|tainers; but the doctrine of the Ma&s;ter of Chri&s;tianity did not remain in Judea, as phi|lo&s;ophy did in Greece, but is &s;pread through|out the whole world, in every nation and village and city, both of Greeks and Barba|rians, converting both whole hou&s;es and &s;eparate individuals, having already brought over to the truth not a few of the philo&s;o|phers them&s;elves. If the Greek philo&s;ophy be prohibited, it immediately vani&s;hes; whereas, from the fir&s;t preaching of <HI>our</HI> doctrine, kings and tyrants, governors and pre&s;idents, with their whole train, and with the populace on their &s;ide, have endeavoured with their whole might to exterminate it,

yet doth it flouri&s;h more and more <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clem. Al. Strom. lib. vi. ad fin.</NOTE>." Ori|gen, who follows Tertullian at the di&s;tance of only thirty years, delivers nearly the &s;ame account: "In every part of the world (&s;ays he), throughout all Greece, and in all other nations, there are innumerable and immen&s;e multitudes, who, having left the laws of their country, and tho&s;e whom they e&s;teemed gods, have given them&s;elves up to the law of Mo&s;es, and the religion of Chri&s;t; and this, not without the bittere&s;t re&s;entment from the idolaters, by whom they were fre|quently put to torture, and &s;ometimes to death: and it is wonderful to ob&s;erve, how, in &s;o &s;hort a time, the religion has increa&s;ed, amid&s;t puni&s;hment and death, and every kind of torture <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Or. in Cel&s;. lib. i.</NOTE>." In another pa&s;&s;age Ori|gen draws the following candid compari&s;on between the &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity in his time, and the condition of its more primitive ages:&mdash;"By the good providence of God the Chri&s;tian religion has &s;o flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed continually, that it is now preached
<PB N="239" REF="244">
freely without mole&s;tation, although there were a thou&s;and ob&s;tacles to the &s;preading of the doctrine of Je&s;us in the world. But as it was the will of God that the Gentiles &s;hould have the benefit of it, all the coun|cils of men again&s;t the Chri&s;tians were de|feated; and by how much the more em|perors and governors of provinces, and the people every where, &s;trove to depre&s;s them, &s;o much the more have they increa&s;ed and prevailed exceedingly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or. con.

<P>It is well known, that within le&s;s than eighty years after this, the Roman empire became Chri&s;tian under Con&s;tantine; and it is probable that Con&s;tantine declared him|&s;elf on the &s;ide of the Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they were the powerful party; for Arnobius, who wrote immediately before Con&s;tantine's acce&s;&s;ion, &s;peaks of the whole world as fill|ed with Chri&s;t's doctrine, of its diffu&s;ion throughout all countries, of an innumerable body of Chri&s;tians in di&s;tant provinces, of

the &s;trange revolution of opinion, of men of the greate&s;t genius, orators, grammarians, rhetoricians, lawyers, phy&s;icians, having come over to the in&s;titution, and that al&s;o in the face of threats, executions, and tor|tures <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arnob. in Gentes, l. i. p. 27. 9. 24. 42. 44. ed. Lug. Bat. 1650.</NOTE>." And not more than twenty years after Con&s;tantine's entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire, Julius Firmicus Maternus calls upon the emperors Con&s;tantius and Con&s;tans to extirpate the relics of the ancient religion; the reduced and fallen condition of which is de&s;cribed by our author in the following words:&mdash;"Licet adhuc in quibu&s;dam regio|nibus idololatriae morientia palpitent mem|bra, tamen in eo res e&s;t, ut a Chri&s;tianis om|nibus terris pe&s;tiferum hoc malum fundit&ugrave;s amputetur;" and in another place, "modi|cum tantum &s;upere&s;t, ut legibus ve&s;tris&mdash;ex|tincta idololatriae pereat fune&s;ta contagio <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Error.

writer in order to recommend his temper or his judgement, but to &s;hew the comparative &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity and of Heatheni&s;m at this period. Fifty years afterwards, Jerome repre&s;ents the decline of Pagani&s;m in lan|guage which conveys the &s;ame idea of its approaching extinction: "Solitudinem pa|titur et in urbe gentilitas. Dii quondam nationum, cum bubonibus et noctuis, in &s;o|lis culminibus reman&s;erunt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. ad Lect. cp. 57.</NOTE>." Jerome here indulges a triumph, natural and allowable in a zealous friend of the cau&s;e, but which could only be &s;ugge&s;ted to his mind by the con&s;ent and univer&s;ality with which he &s;aw the religion received. "But now (&s;ays he) the pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t are celebrated in the di&s;cour&s;es and writings of all nations. I need not mention Jews, Greeks and Latins. The Indians, Per&s;ians, Goths and Egyptians, philo&s;ophi&s;e, and &s;irmly believe the immortality of the &s;oul and future recompences, which, before, the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers had denied, or doubted

Were therefore the motives of Con|&s;tantine's conver&s;ion ever &s;o problematical, the ea&s;y e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, and the ruin of Heatheni&s;m under him and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, is of it&s;elf a proof of the progre&s;s which Chri&s;tianity had made in the preceding period. It may be added al&s;o, "that Maxentius, the rival of Con&s;tan|tine, had &s;hewn him&s;elf friendly to the Chri&s;tians. Therefore, of tho&s;e who were contending for worldly power and empire, one actually favoured and flattered them, and another may be &s;u&s;pected to have join|ed him&s;elf to them, partly from con&s;idera|tion of intere&s;t: &s;o con&s;iderable were they become, under external di&s;advantages of all &s;orts <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. vii. p. 380.</NOTE>."

<P>It may help to convey to us &s;ome notion of the extent and progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, or rather of the character and quality of many early Chri&s;tians, of their learning and their labours, to notice the number of Chri&s;|tian <HI>writers</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the&s;e ages.

<PB N="244" REF="249">
Hippolitus, Eu&s;ebius, were voluminous wri|ters. Chri&s;tian writers abounded particularly about the year 178. Alexander, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, founded a library in that city A. D. 212. Pamphilus, the friend of Ori|gen, founded a library at Ce&s;area A. D. 294. Public defences were al&s;o &s;et forth, by vari|ous advocates of the religion, in the cour&s;e of its three fir&s;t centuries.

<HEAD>SECTION II. Reflections upon the preceding Account.</HEAD>
<P>IN viewing the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, our fir&s;t attention is due to the number of converts at Jeru&s;alem, immediately after its founder's death; becau&s;e this &s;ucce&s;s was a &s;ucce&s;s at the <HI>time,</HI> and upon the <HI>&s;pot,</HI> when and where the chief part of the hi&s;tory had been tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>We are, in the next place, called upon to attend to the early e&s;tabli&s;hment of nu|merous Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties in Judea and Ga|lilee, which countries had been the &s;cene of Chri&s;t's miracles and mini&s;try, and where the memory of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and the knowledge of what was alledged, mu&s;t have yet been fre&s;h and certain.</P>
<P>We are, thirdly, invited to recollect the
<PB N="247" REF="252">
&s;ucce&s;s of the apo&s;tles and of their compa|nions, at the &s;everal places to which they came, both within and without Judea; be|cau&s;e it was the credit given to original witne&s;&s;es, appealing for the truth of their accounts to what them&s;elves had &s;een and heard. The effect al&s;o of their preaching, &s;trongly confirms the truth of what our hi&s;|tory po&s;itively and circum&s;tantially relates, that they were able to exhibit to their hearers &s;upernatural atte&s;tations of their mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are, la&s;tly, to con&s;ider the <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> growth and &s;pread of the religion, of which we receive &s;ucce&s;&s;ive intimations, and &s;atis|factory, though general and occa&s;ional, ac|counts, until its full and final e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e &s;everal &s;tages, the hi&s;tory is without a parallel; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that we have not now been tracing the pro|gre&s;s, and de&s;cribing the prevalency, of an opinion, founded upon philo&s;ophical or cri|tical arguments, upon mere deductions of
<PB N="248" REF="253">
rea&s;on, or the con&s;truction of ancient wri|tings, (of which kind are the &s;everal theo|ries which have, at different times, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public mind in various de|partments of &s;cience and literature; and of one or other of which kind are the tenets al&s;o which divide the various &s;ects of Chri&s;|tianity): but that we &s;peak of a &s;y&s;tem, the very ba&s;is and po&s;tulatum of which was a &s;upernatural character a&s;cribed to a parti|cular per&s;on; of a doctrine, the truth where|of depended entirely upon the truth of a matter of fact then recent. "To e&s;tabli&s;h a new religion, even among&s;t a few peo|ple, or in one &s;ingle nation, is a thing in it|&s;elf exceedingly difficult. To reform &s;ome corruptions which may have &s;pread in a re|ligion, or to make new regulations in it, is not perhaps &s;o hard, when the main and principal parts of that religion are pre&s;erved entire and un&s;haken; and yet this very of|ten cannot be accompli&s;hed, without an ex|traordinary concurrence of circum&s;tances, and may be attempted a thou&s;and times without &s;ucce&s;s. But to introduce a new

faith, a new way of thinking and acting, and to per&s;uade many nations to quit the religion in which their ance&s;tors had lived and died, which had been delivered down to them from time immemorial, to make them for&s;ake and de&s;pi&s;e the deities which they had been accu&s;tomed to reverence and wor&s;hip; this is a work of &s;till greater dif|ficulty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jortin's Di&s;. on the Chri&s;t.

<P>If men, in the&s;e days, be Chri&s;tians in con&s;equence of their education, in &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to authority, or in compliance with fa&s;hion, let us recollect that the very con|trary of this, at the beginning, was the ca&s;e. The fir&s;t race of Chri&s;tians, as well as mil|lions who &s;ucceeded them, became &s;uch in formal oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e motives; to the whole power and &s;trength of this in|fluence. Every argument therefore, and every in&s;tance, which &s;ets forth the prejudice
<PB N="250" REF="255">
of education, and the almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible effects of that prejudice (and no per&s;ons are more fond of expatiating upon this &s;ubject than dei&s;tical writers) in fact confirms the evidence of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>But, in order to judge of the argument which is drawn from the early propagation of Chri&s;tianity, I know no fairer way of proceeding, than to compare what we have &s;een of the &s;ubject, with the &s;ucce&s;s of Chri&s;|tian mi&s;&s;ions in modern ages. In the Ea&s;t-India mi&s;&s;ion, &s;upported by the &s;ociety for promoting Chri&s;tian knowledge, we hear &s;ometimes of thirty, &s;ometimes of forty, be|ing baptized in the cour&s;e of a year, and the&s;e principally children. Of converts properly &s;o called, that is, of adults volun|tarily embracing Chri&s;tianity, the number is extremely &s;mall. "Notwith&s;tanding the labour of mi&s;&s;ionaries for upwards of two hundred years, and the e&s;tabli&s;hments of different Chri&s;tian nations who &s;upport them, there are not twelve thou&s;and Indian

<P>I lament, as much as any man, the little progre&s;s which Chri&s;tianity has made in the&s;e countries, and the incon&s;iderable effect that has followed the labours of its mi&s;&s;ionaries; but I &s;ee in it a &s;trong proof of the divine origin of the religion. What had the apo|&s;tles to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in propagating Chri&s;ti|anity, which the mi&s;&s;ionaries have not? If piety and zeal had been &s;ufficient, I doubt not but that our mi&s;&s;ionaries po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e quali|ties in a high degree, for nothing, except piety and zeal, could engage them in the undertaking. If &s;anctity of life and man|ners was the allurement, the conduct of the&s;e men is unblameable. If the advantage of education and learning be looked to, there is not one of the modern mi&s;&s;ionaries, who is not, in this re&s;pect, &s;uperior to all the apo|&s;tles; and that not only ab&s;olutely, but, what
<PB N="252" REF="257">
is of more importance, <HI>relatively,</HI> in compa|ri&s;on, that is, with tho&s;e among&s;t whom they exerci&s;e their office. If the intrin&s;ic excel|lency of the religion, the perfection of its morality, the purity of its precepts, the elo|quence or tenderne&s;s or &s;ublimity of various parts of its writings, were the recommenda|tions by which it made its way, the&s;e re|main the &s;ame. If the character and cir|cum&s;tances, under which the preachers were introduced to the countries in which they taught, be accounted of importance, this ad|vantage is all on the &s;ide of the modern mi&s;|&s;ionaries. They come from a country and a people, to which the Indian world look up with &s;entiments of deference. The apo|&s;tles came forth among&s;t the Gentiles under no other name than that of Jews, which was preci&s;ely the character they de&s;pi&s;ed and derided. If it be di&s;graceful in India to be|come a Chri&s;tian, it could not be much le&s;s &s;o to be enrolled among&s;t tho&s;e, "quos per flagitia invi&s;os, vulgus Chri&s;tianos appella|bat." If the religion which they had to encounter be con&s;idered, the difference, I

<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the Roligion of Mahomet.</HEAD>
<P>THE only event in the hi&s;tory of the hu|man &s;pecies, which admits of compari&s;on with the propagation of Chri&s;tianity, is the &s;ucce&s;s of Mahometani&s;m. The Mahome|tan in&s;titution was rapid in its progre&s;s, was recent in its hi&s;tory, and was founded upon a &s;upernatural or prophetic character a&s;&s;um|ed by its author. In the&s;e articles the re|&s;emblance with Chri&s;tianity is confe&s;&s;ed. But there are points of difference, which &s;e|parate, we apprehend, the two ca&s;es en|tirely.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mahomet did not found his preten|&s;ions upon miracles, properly &s;o called; that is, upon proofs of &s;upernatural agency, ca|pable of being known and atte&s;ted by others. Chri&s;tians are warranted in this a&s;&s;ertion by the evidence of the Koran, in which Mahomet
<PB N="262" REF="267">
not only does not affect the power of working miracles, but expre&s;sly di&s;claims it. The following pa&s;&s;ages of that book furni&s;h direct proofs of the truth of what we alledge:&mdash;"The infidels &s;ay, unle&s;s a &s;ign be &s;ent down unto him from his lord, we will not believe; thou art a preacher only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sale's Koran, c. xiii. p. 201. ed. quarto.</NOTE>." Again, "Nothing hindered us from &s;ending <HI>thee</HI> with miracles, except that the former nations have charged them with impo&s;ture <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">c. xvii. p. 232.</NOTE>." And la&s;tly, "They &s;ay, unle&s;s a &s;ign be &s;ent down unto him from his lord, we will not believe; an&s;wer, &s;igns are in the power of God alone, and I am no more than a public preacher. Is it not &s;ufficient for them, that we have &s;ent down unto them the book of the Koran to be read unto them <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">c. xxix. p. 328.</NOTE>?" Be&s;ide the&s;e acknowledgments, I have ob&s;erved <HI>thirteen</HI> di&s;tinct places, in which Mahomet puts the objection (unle&s;s a &s;ign, &amp;c.) into the mouth of the unbe|liever, in not one of which does he alledge
<PB N="263" REF="268">
a miracle in reply. His an&s;wer is, "that God giveth the power of working miracles when and to whom he plea&s;eth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sale's Koran, c. v. x. xiii. twice.</NOTE>;" "that if he &s;hould work miracles, they would not believe <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">c. vi.</NOTE>;" "that they had before rejected Mo&s;es; and Je&s;us and the Prophets, who wrought miracles <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">c. iii. xxi. xxviii.</NOTE>;" "that the Koran it&s;elf was a miracle <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">c. xvi.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The only place in the Koran, in which it can be pretended that a &s;en&s;ible miracle is referred to (for I do not allow the &s;ecret vi|&s;itations of Gabriel, the night journey of Mahomet to heaven, or the pre&s;ence in bat|tle of invi&s;ible ho&s;ts of angels, to de&s;erve the name of <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> miracles) is the beginning of the fifty-fourth chapter. The words are the&s;e&mdash;"The hour of judgement approach|eth, <HI>and the moon hath been &s;plit in &s;under,</HI> but if the unbelievers &s;ee a &s;ign, they turn a&s;ide &s;aying, this is a powerful charm." The Mahometan expo&s;itors di&s;agree in their interpretation of this pa&s;&s;age; &s;ome explaining
<PB N="264" REF="269">
it to be a mention of the &s;plitting of the moon, as one of the future &s;igns of the ap|proach of the day of judgement; others refer|ring it to a miraculous appearance which had then taken place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sale in loc.</NOTE>. It &s;eems to me not impro|bable, that Mahomet may have taken advan|tage of &s;ome extraordinary halo, or other unu&s;ual appearance of the moon, which had happened about this time; and which &s;up|plied a foundation both for this pa&s;&s;age, and for the &s;tory which in after times had been rai&s;ed out of it.</P>
<P>After this more than &s;ilence; after the&s;e authentic <HI>confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of the Koran, we are not to be moved with miraculous &s;tories related of Mahomet by Abulfeda, who wrote his life about &s;ix hundred years after his death; or which are found in the legend of Al Jan|nabi, who came two hundred years later <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It does not, I think, appear, that the&s;e hi&s;torians had any written accounts to appeal to more ancient than the Sonnah, which was a collection of traditions, made by order of the Caliphs, two hundred years after Mahomet's death. Mahomet died A. D. 632; Al. Bochari, one of the &s;ix doctors who compiled the Son|nah, was born A. D. 809, died 869. Prideaux's Life of Mahomet, p. 192. ed. 7th.</NOTE>.
<PB N="265" REF="270">
On the contrary, from comparing what Ma|homet him&s;elf wrote and &s;aid, with what was afterwards reported of him by his fol|lowers, the plain and fair conclu&s;ion is, that, when the religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed by con|que&s;t, then, and not till then, came out the &s;tories of his miracles.</P>
<P>Now this difference alone con&s;titutes, in my opinion, a bar to all rea&s;oning from one ca&s;e to the other. The &s;ucce&s;s of a religion founded upon a miraculous hi&s;tory, &s;hews the credit which was given to the hi&s;tory; and this credit, under the circum&s;tances in which it was given, <HI>i. e.</HI> by per&s;ons capable of knowing the truth, and intere&s;ted to en|quire after it, is evidence of the reality of the hi&s;tory, and, by con&s;equence, of the truth of the religion. Where a miraculous hi&s;tory is not alledged, no part of this argument
<PB N="266" REF="271">
can be implied. We admit that mul|titudes acknowledged the preten&s;ions of Ma|homet; but the&s;e preten&s;ions being de&s;titute of miraculous evidence, we know that the grounds upon which they were acknow|ledged, could not be &s;ecure grounds of per|&s;ua&s;ion to his followers, nor their example any authority to us. Admit the whole of Mahomet's authentic hi&s;tory, &s;o far as it was of a nature capable of being known or wit|ne&s;&s;ed by others, to be true, (which is cer|tainly to admit all that the reception of the religion can be brought to prove), and Ma|homet might &s;till be an impo&s;tor, or enthu|&s;ia&s;t, or an union of both. Admit to be true almo&s;t any part of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory, of that, I mean, which was public, and within the cogni&s;ance of his followers, and he mu&s;t have come from God. Where matter of fact is not in que&s;tion, where miracles are not alledged, I do not &s;ee that the progre&s;s of a religion is a better argument of its truth, than the prevalency of any &s;y&s;tem of opi|nions in natural religion, morality, or phy&s;ics, is a proof of the truth of tho&s;e opinions.
<PB N="267" REF="272">
And we know that this &s;ort of ar|gument is inadmi&s;&s;ible in any branch of phi|lo&s;ophy whatever.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, if one religion could make its way without miracles, why might not another? To which I reply, fir&s;t, that this is not the que&s;tion: the proper que&s;tion is not, whether a religious in&s;titution could be &s;et up without miracles, but whether a religion, or a change of religion, founding it&s;elf in miracles, could &s;ucceed without any reality to re&s;t upon? I apprehend the&s;e two ca&s;es to be very different; and I apprehend Mahomet's not taking this cour&s;e to be one proof, among&s;t others, that the thing is dif|ficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to be accompli&s;hed: certainly it was not from an uncon&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of the value and importance of mira|culous evidence, for it is very ob&s;ervable, that in the &s;ame volume, and &s;ometimes in the &s;ame chapters, in which Mahomet &s;o re|peatedly di&s;claims the power of working miracles him&s;elf, he is ince&s;&s;antly referring to the miracles of preceding prophets. One
<PB N="268" REF="273">
would imagine, to hear &s;ome men talk, or to read &s;ome books, that the &s;etting up of a religion by dint of miraculous pretences was a thing of every day's experience; whereas I believe, that, except the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;|tian religion, there is no tolerably well au|thenticated account of any &s;uch thing hav|ing been accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Maho|met's religion was effected by cau&s;es, which, in no degree, appertained to the origin of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t twelve years of his mi&s;|&s;ion, Mahomet had recour&s;e only to per&s;ua|&s;ion. This is allowed. And there is &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on from the effect to believe, that if he had confined him&s;elf to this mode of propagating his religion, we of the pre&s;ent day &s;hould never have heard either of him or it. "Three years were &s;ilently employ|ed in the conver&s;ion of <HI>fourteen</HI> pro&s;elytes. For ten years the religion advanced with a &s;low and painful progre&s;s within the walls
<PB N="269" REF="274">
of Mecca. The number of pro&s;elytes in the &s;eventh year of his mi&s;&s;ion may be e&s;ti|mated by the ab&s;ence of <HI>eighty-three</HI> men and eighteen women, who retired to Aethio|pia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibbon's Hi&s;t. vol. ix. p. 244 et &s;eq. ed. Dub.</NOTE>." Yet this progre&s;s, &s;uch as it was, appears to have been aided by &s;ome very important advantages, which Mahomet found in his &s;ituation, in his mode of con|ducting his de&s;ign, and in his doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mahomet was the grand&s;on of the mo&s;t powerful and honourable family in Mecca; and although the early death of his father had not left him a patrimony &s;uitable to his birth, he had, long before the com|mencement of his mi&s;&s;ion, repaired this de|ficiency by an opulent marriage. A per&s;on con&s;iderable by his wealth, of high de&s;cent, and nearly allied to the chiefs of his coun|try, taking upon him&s;elf the character of a religious teacher, would not fail of attract|ing attention and followers.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="270" REF="275">
2. Mahomet conducted his de&s;ign, in the out&s;et e&s;pecially, with great art and pru|dence. He conducted it as a politician would conduct a plot. His fir&s;t application was to his own family. This gained him his wife's uncle, a con&s;iderable per&s;on in Mecca, together with his cou&s;in Ali, after|wards the celebrated Caliph, then a youth of great expectation, and even already di&s;|tingui&s;hed by his attachment, impetuo&s;ity and courage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of which Mr. Gibbon has pre&s;erved the following &s;pecimen:&mdash;"When Mahomet called out in an a&s;&s;em|bly of his family, who among you will be my compa|nion, and my vizir? Ali, then only in the fourteenth year of his age, &s;uddenly replied, O prophet, I am the man; who&s;oever ri&s;es again&s;t thee, I will da&s;h out his teeth, tear out his eyes, break his legs, rip up his belly. O prophet, I will be thy vizir over them." Vol. ix. p. 245.</NOTE>. He next addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Abu Becr, a man among&s;t the fir&s;t of the Korei&s;h in wealth and influence. The intere&s;t and example of Abu Becr drew in five other principal per&s;ons in Mecca, who&s;e &s;olicitations prevailed upon five more of the
<PB N="271" REF="276">
&s;ame rank. This was the work of three years; during which time every thing was tran&s;acted in &s;ecret. Upon the &s;trength of the&s;e allies, and under the powerful protec|tion of his family, who, however &s;ome of them might di&s;approve his enterpri&s;e, or de|ride his preten&s;ions, would not &s;uffer the orphan of their hou&s;e, the relict of their fa|vourite brother, to be in&s;ulted, Mahomet now commenced his public preaching. And the advance which he made, during the nine or ten remaining years of his peaceable mi|ni&s;try, was by no means greater than what, with the&s;e advantages, and with the addi|tional and &s;ingular circum&s;tance of there being no <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> religion at Mecca at that time to contend with, might rea&s;onably have been expected. How &s;oon his primitive ad|herents were let into the &s;ecret of his views of empire, or in what &s;tage of his undertak|ing the&s;e views fir&s;t opened them&s;elves to his own mind, it is not now ea&s;y to deter|mine. The event however was, that the&s;e his fir&s;t pro&s;elytes all ultimately attained to

riches and honours, to the command of ar|mies, and the government of kingdoms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gib. vol. ix. p. 244.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Arabs deduced their de&s;cent from Abraham through the line of I&s;hmael. The inhabitants of Mecca, in common probably with the other Arabian tribes, acknowledged, as, I think, may clearly be collected from the Koran, one &s;upreme deity, but had a&s;&s;o|ciated with him many objects of idolatrous wor&s;hip. The great doctrine, with which Mahomet &s;et out, was the &s;trict and exclu|&s;ive unity of God. Abraham, he told them, their illu&s;trious ance&s;tor; I&s;hmael, the fa|ther of their nation; Mo&s;es, the law-giver of the Jews; and Je&s;us, the author of Chri&s;|tianity, had all a&s;&s;erted the &s;ame thing; that their followers had univer&s;ally corrupt|ed the truth, and that <HI>he</HI> was now com|mi&s;&s;ioned to re&s;tore it to the world. Was it to be wondered at, that a doctrine &s;o &s;pe|cious, and authori&s;ed by names, &s;ome or other of which were holden in the highe&s;t
<PB N="273" REF="278">
veneration by every de&s;cription of his hear|ers, &s;hould, in the hands of a popular mi&s;|&s;ionary, prevail to the extent in which Ma|homet &s;ucceeded by his pacific mini&s;try?</P>
<P N="4">4. Of the in&s;titution which Mahomet joined with this fundamental doctrine, and of the Koran in which that in&s;titution is de|livered, we di&s;cover, I think, two purpo&s;es that pervade the whole, viz. to make con|verts, and to make his converts &s;oldiers. The following particulars, among&s;t others, may be con&s;idered as pretty evident indica|tions of the&s;e de&s;igns:</P>
<P N="1">1. When Mahomet began to preach, his addre&s;s to the Jews, the Chri&s;tians, and to the Pagan Arabs, was, that the religion which he taught, was no other than what had been originally their own. "We be|lieve in God, and that which hath been &s;ent down unto us, and that which hath been &s;ent down unto Abraham, and I&s;mael and I&s;aac, and Jacob and the tribes, and that which was delivered unto Mo&s;es and Je&s;us,
<PB N="274" REF="279">
and that which was delivered unto the Pro|phets from their Lord; we make no di&s;|tinction between any of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sale's Koran, c. ii. p. 17.</NOTE>." "He hath ordained you the religion which he commanded Noah, and which we have re|vealed unto thee, O Mohammed, and which we commanded Abraham and Mo&s;es and Je&s;us, &s;aying, ob&s;erve this religion, and be not divided therein <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. xlii. p. 393.</NOTE>." "He hath cho&s;en you, and hath not impo&s;ed on you any difficulty in the religion which he hath given you, the religion of your father Abraham <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. xxii. p. 281.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">2. The author of the Koran never cea&s;es from de&s;cribing the future angui&s;h of unbe|lievers, their de&s;pair, regret, penitence, and torment. It is the point which he labours above all others.

<P>What has hitherto been collected from the records of the Mu&s;&s;ulman hi&s;tory, re|lates to the twelve or thirteen years of Ma|homet's peaceable preaching, which part alone of his life and enterpri&s;e admits of the &s;malle&s;t compari&s;on with the origin of
<PB N="280" REF="285">
Chri&s;tianity. A new &s;cene is now unfolded. The city of Medina, di&s;tant about ten days journey from Mecca, was at that time di&s;|tracted by the hereditary contentions of two ho&s;tile tribes. The&s;e feuds were exa&s;perated by the mutual per&s;ecutions of the Jews and Chri&s;tians, and of the different Chri&s;tian &s;ects by which the city was inhabited <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mod. Un. Hi&s;t. vol. i. p. 100.</NOTE>. The religion of Mahomet pre&s;ented, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a point of union or compro|mi&s;e to the&s;e divided opinions. It embraced the principles which were common to them all. Each party &s;aw in it an honourable acknowledgement of the fundamental truth of their own &s;y&s;tem. To the Pagan Arab, &s;omewhat imbued with the &s;entiments and knowledge of his Jewi&s;h or Chri&s;tian fellow citizen, it offered no offen&s;ive, or very im|probable theology. This recommendation procured to Mahometani&s;m a more favour|able reception at Medina, than its author had been able, by twelve years painful en|deavours, to obtain for it at Mecca. Yet,
<PB N="281" REF="286">
after all, the progre&s;s of the religion was incon&s;iderable. His mi&s;&s;ionary could only collect a congregation of forty per&s;ons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 85.</NOTE>. It was not a religious, but a political a&s;&s;o|ciation, which ultimately introduced Maho|met into Medina. Hara&s;&s;ed, as it &s;hould &s;eem, and di&s;gu&s;ted by the long continuance of factions and di&s;putes, the inhabitants of that city &s;aw in the admi&s;&s;ion of the Pro|phet's authority, a re&s;t from the mi&s;eries which they had &s;uffered, and a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the violence and fury which they had learnt to condemn. After an emba&s;&s;y there|fore, compo&s;ed of believers and unbelievers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 85.</NOTE>, and of per&s;ons of both tribes, with whom a treaty was concluded of &s;trict alliance and &s;upport, Mahomet made his public entry, and was received as the Sovereign of Me|dina.</P>
<P>From this time, or &s;oon after this time, the impo&s;tor changed his language and his conduct. Having now a town at his command,
<PB N="282" REF="287">
where to arm his party, and to head them with &s;ecurity, he enters upon new councils. He now pretends that a divine commi&s;&s;ion is given to him to attack the in&s;idels, to de&s;troy idolatry, and to &s;et up the true faith by the &s;word <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 88.</NOTE>. An early victory over a very &s;uperior force, achieved by conduct and bravery, e&s;tabli&s;hed the re|nown of his arms, and of his per&s;onal cha|racter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Victory of Bedr, ib. p. 106.</NOTE>. Every year after this was marked by battles or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations. The nature and activity of Mahomet's future exertions may be e&s;timated from the computation, that, in the nine following years of his life, he com|manded his army in per&s;on in eight gene|ral engagements <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Un. Hi&s;t. vol. i. p. 255.</NOTE>, and undertook, by him|&s;elf or his lieutenants, fifty military enter|pri&s;es.</P>
<P>From this time we have nothing left to account for, but that Mahomet &s;hould col|lect an army, that his army &s;hould conquer, and that his religion &s;hould proceed together
<PB N="283" REF="288">
with his conque&s;ts. The ordinary experi|ence of human affairs, leaves us little to wonder at, in any of the&s;e effects: and they were likewi&s;e each a&s;&s;i&s;ted by peculiar faci|lities. From all &s;ides, the roving Arabs crowded around the &s;tandard of religion and plunder, of freedom and victory, of arms and rapine. Be&s;ide the highly painted joys of a carnal paradi&s;e, Mahomet rewarded his followers in this world with a liberal di|vi&s;ion of the &s;poils, and with the per&s;ons of their female captives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibb. vol. ix. p. 255.</NOTE>. The condition of Arabia, occupied by &s;mall independent tribes, expo&s;ed it to the impre&s;&s;ion, and yielded to the progre&s;s of a firm and re&s;o|lute army. After the reduction of his na|tive penin&s;ula, the weakne&s;s al&s;o of the Ro|man provinces on the North and the We&s;t, as well as the di&s;tracted &s;tate of the Per&s;ian empire on the Ea&s;t, facilitated the &s;ucce&s;sful inva&s;ion of neighbouring countries. That Mahomet's conque&s;ts &s;hould carry his reli|gion along with them, will excite little &s;ur|pri&s;e,
<PB N="284" REF="289">
when we know the conditions which he propo&s;ed to the vanqui&s;hed. Death or conver&s;ion was the only choice offered to idolaters. "Strike off their heads; &s;trike off all the ends of their fingers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sale's Coran, c. viii. p. 140.</NOTE>: kill the idolaters, where&s;oever ye &s;hall find them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. ix. p. 149.</NOTE>." To the Jews and Chri&s;tians was left the &s;omewhat milder alternative, of &s;ubjection and tribute, if they per&s;i&s;ted in their own religion, or of an equal participation in the rights and liberties, the honours and privi|leges, of the faithful, if they embraced the religion of their conquerors. "Ye Chri&s;|tian dogs, you know your option; the Ko|ran, the tribute, or the &s;word <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gibb. ib. p. 337.</NOTE>." The cor|rupt &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity in the &s;eventh cen|tury, and the contentions of its &s;ects, unhap|pily &s;o fell in with mens care of their &s;afety, or their fortunes, as to induce many to for|&s;ake its profe&s;&s;ion. Add to all which, that Mahomet's victories not only operated by the natural effect of conque&s;t, but that they
<PB N="285" REF="290">
were con&s;tantly repre&s;ented both to his friends and enemies, as divine declarations in his favour. Succe&s;s was evidence. Pro|&s;perity carried with it, not only influence, but proof. "Ye have already," &s;ays he, after the battle of Bedr, "had a miracle &s;hown you, in two armies which attacked each other; one army fought for God's true re|ligion, but the other were in&s;idels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sale's Kor. c. iii. p. 36.</NOTE>." Again, <HI>"Ye</HI> &s;lew not tho&s;e who were &s;lain at Bedr, but God &s;lew them.&mdash;If ye de&s;ire a deci|&s;ion of the matter between us, now hath a deci&s;ion come unto you <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ch. viii. p. 141.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Many more pa&s;&s;ages might be collected out of the Koran to the &s;ame effect. But they are unnece&s;&s;ary. The &s;ucce&s;s of Ma|hometani&s;m during this, and indeed every future period of its hi&s;tory, bears &s;o little re&s;emblance to the early propagation of Chri&s;tianity, that no inference whatever can ju&s;tly be drawn from it to the prejudice of the Chri&s;tian argument. For what are we
<PB N="286" REF="291">
comparing? A Galilean pea&s;ant, accompa|nied by a few fi&s;hermen, with a conqueror at the head of his army. We compare Je&s;us, without force, without power, with|out &s;upport, without one external circum|&s;tance of attraction or influence, prevailing again&s;t the prejudices, the learning, the hierarchy of his country, again&s;t the ancient religious opinions, the pompous religious rites, the philo&s;ophy, the wi&s;dom, the au|thority of the Roman empire, in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed and enlightened period of its exi&s;t|ence, with Mahomet making his way among&s;t Arabs; collecting followers in the mid&s;t of conque&s;ts and triumphs, in the dark|e&s;t ages and countries of the world, and when &s;ucce&s;s in arms not only operated by that command of men's wills and per&s;ons which attends pro&s;perous undertakings, but was con&s;idered as a &s;ure te&s;timony of divine approbation. That multitudes, per&s;uaded by this argument, &s;hould join the train of a victorious chief; that &s;till greater multitudes &s;hould, without any argument, bow down before irre&s;i&s;tible power, is a conduct in
<PB N="287" REF="292">
which we cannot &s;ee much to &s;urpri&s;e us; in which we can &s;ee nothing that re&s;embles the cau&s;es, by which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity was effected.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s therefore of Mahometani&s;m &s;tands not in the way of this important con|clu&s;ion, that the propagation of Chri&s;tianity, in the manner and under the circum&s;tances in which it was propagated, is an <HI>unique</HI> in the hi&s;tory of the &s;pecies.

It is &s;till true, that a great number of men upon the &s;pot, per&s;onally connected with the hi&s;tory and with the author of the religion, were in|duced by what they heard and &s;aw and knew, not only to change their former opi|nions, but to give up their time, and &s;acrifice

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Di&s;crepancies between the &s;everal Go&s;pels.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW not a more ra&s;h or unphilo&s;o|phical conduct of the under&s;tanding, than to reject the &s;ub&s;tance of a &s;tory, by rea&s;on of &s;ome diver&s;ity in the circum&s;tances with which it is related. The u&s;ual character of human te&s;timony is &s;ub&s;tantial truth under circum&s;tantial variety. This is what the daily experience of courts of ju&s;tice teaches. When accounts of a tran&s;action come from the mouths of different witne&s;&s;es, it is &s;eldom
<PB N="290" REF="295">
that it is not po&s;&s;ible to pick out appa|rent or real incon&s;i&s;tencies between them. The&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies are &s;tudiou&s;ly di&s;play|ed by an adver&s;e pleader, but oftentimes with little impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of the judges. On the contrary, a clo&s;e and mi|nute agreement induces the &s;u&s;picion of confederacy and fraud. When written hi&s;|tories touch upon the &s;ame &s;cenes of action, the compari&s;on almo&s;t always affords ground for a like reflection. Numerous, and &s;ome|times important, variations pre&s;ent them|&s;elves; not &s;eldom al&s;o, ab&s;olute and final contradictions; yet neither one nor the other are deemed &s;ufficient to &s;hake the credibility of the main fact. The emba&s;&s;y of the Jews to deprecate the execution of Claudian's or|der to place his &s;tatue in their temple, Philo places in harve&s;t, Jo&s;ephus in &s;eed-time; both contemporary writers. No reader is led by this incon&s;i&s;tency to doubt, whether &s;uch an emba&s;&s;y was &s;ent, or whether &s;uch an order was given. Our own hi&s;tory &s;upplies ex|amples of the &s;ame kind. In the account of the Marquis of Argyle's death in the reign
<PB N="291" REF="296">
of Charles the Second, we have a very re|markable contradiction. Lord Clarendon re|lates that he was condemned to be hanged, which was performed the &s;ame day: on the contrary, Burnet, Woodrow, Heath, Echard, concur in &s;tating that he was beheaded; and that he was condemned upon the Saturday, and executed upon the Monday <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Biog. Britan.</NOTE>. Was any reader of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory ever &s;ceptic enough to rai&s;e from hence a que&s;tion, whe|ther the Marquis of Argyle was executed, or not? Yet this ought to be left in uncertainty, according to the principles upon which the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory has &s;ometimes been attack|ed. Dr. Middleton contended, that the dif|ferent hours of the day a&s;&s;igned to the cru|cifixion of Chri&s;t, by John and by the other evangeli&s;ts, did not admit of the reconcile|ment which learned men had propo&s;ed; and then concludes the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with this hard remark: "We mu&s;t be forced&punc; with &s;everal of the critics, to leave the difficulty ju&s;t as
<PB N="292" REF="297">
we found it, chargeable with all the con&s;e|quences of manife&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Middleton's Reflections an&s;wered by Ben&s;on. Hi&s;t. Chri&s;. vol. iii. p. 50.</NOTE>." But what are the&s;e con&s;equences? by no means the di&s;crediting of the hi&s;tory as to the prin|cipal fact, by a repugnancy (even &s;uppo&s;ing that repugnancy not to be re&s;olvable into different modes of computation) in the time of the day in which it is &s;aid to have taken place.</P>
<P>A great deal of the di&s;crepancy, ob&s;ervable in the Go&s;pels, ari&s;es from <HI>omi&s;&s;ion;</HI> from a fact or a pa&s;&s;age of Chri&s;t's life being noticed by one writer, which is unnoticed by ano|ther. Now omi&s;&s;ion is at all times a very uncertain ground of objection. We per|ceive it, not only in the compari&s;on of dif|ferent writers, but even in the &s;ame writer, when compared with him&s;elf. There are a great many particulars, and &s;ome of them of importance, mentioned by Jo&s;ephus in his Antiquities, which, as we &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="293" REF="298">
ought to have been put down by him in their place in the Jewi&s;h Wars <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. part i. vol. ii. p. 735, et &s;eq.</NOTE>. Sueto|nius, Tacitus, Dio Ca&s;&s;ius, have, all three, written of the reign of Tiberius. Each has mentioned many things omitted by the re&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 743.</NOTE>, yet no objection is from thence taken to the re&s;pective credit of their hi&s;tories. We have in our own times, if there were not &s;ome|thing indecorous in the compari&s;on, the life of an eminent per&s;on, written by three of his friends, in which there is very great variety in the incidents &s;elected by them; &s;ome ap|parent, and perhaps &s;ome real contradictions; yet without any impeachment of the &s;ub|&s;tantial truth of their accounts, of the authen|ticity of the books, of the competent informa|tion or general fidelity of the writers.</P>
<P>But the&s;e di&s;crepancies will be &s;till more numerous, when men do not write hi&s;tories, but <HI>memoirs;</HI> which is perhaps the true name, and proper de&s;cription of our Go&s;pels: that is, when they do not undertake, or ever
<PB N="294" REF="299">
meant to deliver, in order of time, a regular and complete account of <HI>all</HI> the things of importance, which the per&s;on, who is the &s;ubject of their hi&s;tory, did or &s;aid; but only, out of many &s;imilar ones, to give &s;uch pa&s;|&s;ages, or &s;uch actions and di&s;cour&s;es, as offer|ed them&s;elves more immediately to their at|tention, came in the way of their enquiries, occurred to their recollection, or were &s;ug|ge&s;ted by their <HI>particular de&s;ign</HI> at the time of writing.</P>
<P>This particular de&s;ign may appear &s;ome|times, but not always, nor often. Thus I think that the particular de&s;ign, which St. Matthew had in view whil&s;t he was writing the hi&s;tory of the re&s;urrection, was to atte&s;t the faithful performance of Chri&s;t's promi&s;e to his di&s;ciples to go before them into Gali|lee; becau&s;e he alone, except Mark, who &s;eems to have taken it from him, has record|ed this promi&s;e, and he alone has confined his narrative to that &s;ingle appearance to the di&s;ciples which fulfilled it. It was the pre|concerted, the great and mo&s;t public manife&s;tation
<PB N="295" REF="300">
of our Lord's per&s;on. It was the thing which dwelt upon St. Matthew's mind, and he adapted his narrative to it. But, that there is nothing in St. Matthew's lan|guage, which negatives other appearances, or which imports that this his appearance to his di&s;ciples in Galilee, in pur&s;uance of his promi&s;e, was his fir&s;t or only appearance, is made pretty evident by St. Mark's Go&s;pel, which u&s;es the &s;ame terms concerning the appearance in Galilee as St. Matthew u&s;es, yet it&s;elf records two other appearances prior to this; "Go your way, tell his di&s;ciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into Ga|lilee, then &s;hall ye &s;ee him as he &s;aid unto you." (xvi. 7.) We might be apt to infer from the&s;e words, that this was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time they were to &s;ee him: at lea&s;t, we might in|fer it, with as much rea&s;on as we draw the inference from the &s;ame words in Matthew: yet the hi&s;torian him&s;elf did not perceive that he was leading his readers to any &s;uch conclu&s;ion; for, in the twelfth and two following ver&s;es of this chapter, he informs us of two appearances, which, by comparing
<PB N="296" REF="301">
the order of events, are &s;hewn to have been prior to the appearance in Galilee. "He ap|peared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country; and went and told it unto the re&s;idue, neither be|lieved they them: afterwards he appeared unto the eleven, as they &s;at at meat, and up|braided them with their unbelief, becau&s;e they believed not them that had &s;een him after he was ri&s;en."</P>
<P>Probably the &s;ame ob&s;ervation, concern|ing the <HI>particular de&s;ign</HI> which guided the hi&s;torian, may be of u&s;e in comparing many other pa&s;&s;ages of the Go&s;pels.</P>

<PB N="298" REF="303">
the quotations of the Old Te&s;tament found in the New; &s;ome of which quotations, it is &s;aid, are applied in a &s;en&s;e, and to events, apparently different from that which they bear, and from tho&s;e to which they belong, in the original. It is probable to my appre|hen&s;ion, that many of tho&s;e quotations were intended by the writers of the New Te&s;ta|ment as nothing more than <HI>accommodations.</HI> They quoted pa&s;&s;ages of their &s;cripture, which &s;uited, and fell in with, the occa&s;ion before them, without always undertaking to a&s;&s;ert, that the occa&s;ion was in the view of the author of the words. Such accommoda|tions of pa&s;&s;ages from old authors, from books e&s;pecially, which are in every one's hands, are common with writers of all coun|tries; but in none, perhaps, were more to be expected, than in the writings of the Jews, who&s;e literature was almo&s;t entirely confined to their &s;criptures. Tho&s;e prophecies which are alledged with more &s;olemnity, and which are accompanied with a preci&s;e declaration, that they originally re&s;pected the event then related, are, I think, truly alledged. But

were it otherwi&s;e; is the judgment of the writers of the New Te&s;tament, in interpret|ing pa&s;&s;ages of the Old, or &s;ometimes, per|haps, in receiving e&s;tabli&s;hed interpretations, &s;o connected, either with their veracity, or with their means of information concerning what was pa&s;&s;ing in their own times, as that a critical mi&s;take, even were it clearly made out, &s;hould overthrow their hi&s;torical cre|dit?&mdash;Does it dimini&s;h it? Has it any thing to do with it?</P>
<P>Another error, imputed to the fir&s;t Chri&s;|tians, was the expected approach of the day of judgment. I would introduce this objec|tion, by a remark, upon what appears to me a &s;omewhat &s;imilar example. Our Saviour, &s;peaking to Peter of John, &s;aid, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 23.</NOTE>." The&s;e words, we find, had been &s;o mi&s;con&s;trued, as that "a report" from thence "went abroad among the brethren, that that di&s;ciple &s;hould not die." Suppo&s;e that this
<PB N="300" REF="305">
had come down to us among&s;t the prevail|ing opinions of the early Chri&s;tians, and that the particular circum&s;tance, from which the mi&s;take &s;prung, had been lo&s;t, (which hu|manly &s;peaking was mo&s;t likely to have been the ca&s;e) &s;ome, at this day, would have been ready to regard and quote the error, as an impeachment of the whole Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. Yet with how little ju&s;tice &s;uch a conclu&s;ion would have been drawn, or rather &s;uch a pre&s;umption taken up, the information, which we happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s, enables us now to perceive. To tho&s;e who think that the Scriptures lead us to believe, that the early Chri&s;tians, and even the Apo&s;tles, expected the approach of the day of judgment in their own times, the &s;ame reflection will occur, as that which we have made, with re&s;pect to the more partial perhaps and temporary, but &s;till no le&s;s ancient error, concerning the duration of St. John's life. It was an error, it may be likewi&s;e &s;aid, which would effec|tually hinder tho&s;e, who entertained it, from acting the part of impo&s;tors.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="306">
The difficulty which attends the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent chapter, is contained in this que&s;|tion; if we once admit the fallibility of the apo&s;tolic judgment, where are we to &s;top, or in what can we rely upon it? To which que&s;tion, as arguing with unbelievers, and as arguing for the &s;ub&s;tantial truth of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, and for that alone, it is competent to the advocate of Chri&s;tianity to reply, Give me the apo&s;tle's te&s;timony, and I do not &s;tand in need of their judgment; give me the facts, and I have complete &s;e|curity for every conclu&s;ion I want.</P>
<P>But, although I think that it is compe|tent to the Chri&s;tian apologi&s;t to return this an&s;wer; I do not think that it is the only an&s;wer which the objection is capable of re|ceiving. The two following cautions, found|ed, I apprehend, in the mo&s;t rea&s;onable di&s;|tinctions, will exclude all uncertainty upon this head, which can be attended with danger.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to &s;eparate what was the object of the apo&s;tolic mi&s;&s;ion, and declared by them
<PB N="302" REF="307">
to be &s;o, from what was extraneous to it, or only incidentally connected with it. Of points clearly extraneous to the religion, nothing need be &s;aid. Of points inciden|tally connected with it, &s;omething may be added. Demoniacal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is one of the&s;e points: concerning the reality of which, as this place will not admit the examination, or even the production of the arguments on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion, it would be arro|gance in me to deliver any judgment. And it is unnece&s;&s;ary. For what I am concerned to ob&s;erve is, that even they who think that it was a general, but erroneous, opinion of tho&s;e times; and that the writers of the New Te&s;tament, in common with other Jewi&s;h writers of that age, fell into the man|ner of &s;peaking and of thinking upon the &s;ubject, which then univer&s;ally prevailed; need not be alarmed by the conce&s;&s;ion, as though they had any thing to fear from it, for the truth of Chri&s;tianity. The doctrine was not what Chri&s;t brought into the world. It appears in the Chri&s;tian records, inciden|tally and accidentally, as being the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="303" REF="308">
opinion of the age and country in which his mini&s;try was exerci&s;ed. It was no part of the object of <HI>his</HI> revelation, to regulate mens opinions concerning the action of &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tances upon animal bodies. At any rate it is unconnected with te&s;timony. If a dumb per&s;on was by a word re&s;tored to the u&s;e of his &s;peech, it &s;ignifies little to what cau&s;e the dumbne&s;s was a&s;cribed; and the like of every other cure wrought upon tho&s;e who are &s;aid to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The malady was real, the cure was real, whether the popular explication of the cau&s;e was well founded, or not. The matter of fact, the change, &s;o far as it was an object of &s;en&s;e, or of te&s;timony, was in either ca&s;e the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Secondly, that, in reading the apo&s;tolic writings, we di&s;tingui&s;h between their doc|trines and their arguments. Their doc|tines came to them by revelation properly &s;o called; yet in propounding the&s;e doctrines in their writings or di&s;cour&s;es, they were wont to illu&s;trate, &s;upport and enforce them,
<PB N="304" REF="309">
by &s;uch analogies, arguments, and con&s;ider|ations as their own thoughts &s;ugge&s;ted. Thus the call of the Gentiles, that is, the admi&s;&s;ion of the Gentiles to the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion without a previous &s;ubjection to the law of Mo&s;es, was imparted to the Apo|&s;tles by revelation, and was atte&s;ted by the miracles which attended the Chri&s;tian mi|ni&s;try among&s;t them. The Apo&s;tles own a&s;&s;urance of the matter re&s;ted upon this foundation. Neverthele&s;s, St. Paul, when treating of the &s;ubject, offers a great variety of topics in its proof and vindication. The doctrine it&s;elf mu&s;t be received; but is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to defend Chri&s;tianity, to defend the propriety of every compari&s;on, or the validity of every argument, which the apo&s;tle has brought into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to &s;ome other in&s;tances; and is, in my opinion, very well founded. "When divine writers argue upon any point, we are always bound to be|lieve the conclu&s;ions that their rea&s;onings end in, as parts of divine revelation; but we are not bound to be able to make out, or

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Connection of Chri&s;tianity with the Jewi&s;h Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>UNDOUBTEDLY, our Saviour a&s;&s;umes the divine origin of the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution: and, independently of his authority, I con|ceive it to be very difficult to a&s;&s;ign any other cau&s;e for the commencement or exi&s;tence of that in&s;titution; e&s;pecially for the &s;ingular circum&s;tance of the Jews adhering to the unity, when every other people &s;lid into po|lythei&s;m; for their being men in religion, children in every thing el&s;e; behind other nations in the arts of peace and war, &s;upe|rior to the mo&s;t improved in their &s;entiments and doctrines relating to the deity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In the doctrine, for example, of the unity, the eter|nity, the omnipotence, the omni&s;cience, the omnipre|&s;ence, the wi&s;dom and the goodne&s;s of God; in their opi|nions concerning providence, and the creation, pre&s;ervation, and government of the world." Campbell on Mir. p. 207.

Upon the&s;e con|ceits re&s;ted the whole train of auguries and au&s;pices, which formed &s;o much even of the &s;erious part of the religions of Greece and Rome, and of the charms and incantations which were practi&s;ed in tho&s;e countries by the common people.

great, but unnece&s;&s;ary difficulties, into the whole &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e books were univer|&s;ally read and received by the Jews of our Saviour's time. He and his apo&s;tles, in common with all other Jews, referred to them, alluded to them, u&s;ed them. Yet, except where he expre&s;sly a&s;cribes a divine authority to particular predictions, I do not know that we can &s;trictly draw any conclu&s;ion from the books being &s;o u&s;ed and applied, be&s;ide the proof, which it unque&s;|tionably is, of their notoriety and reception at that time. In this view our &s;criptures af|ford a valuable te&s;timony to tho&s;e of the Jews. But the nature of this te&s;timony ought to be under&s;tood. It is &s;urely very different from, what it is &s;ometimes repre|&s;ented to be, a &s;pecific ratification of each particular fact and opinion; and not only of each particular fact, but of the motives a&s;&s;igned for every action, together with the judgment of prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e be&s;towed upon them. St. James, in his epi&s;tle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">v. 11.</NOTE>,
<PB N="309" REF="314">
&s;ays, "Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have &s;een the end of the Lord." Notwith&s;tanding this text, the reality of Job's hi&s;tory, and even the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a per&s;on, has been always deemed a fair &s;ubject of enquiry and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion among&s;t Chri&s;tian divines. St. James's authority is con&s;idered as good evidence of the exi&s;tence of the book of Job at that time, and of its reception by the Jews, and of nothing more. St. Paul, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">iii. 8.</NOTE>, has this &s;imilitude: "Now, as Jannes and Jambres with&s;tood Mo&s;es, &s;o do the&s;e al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth." The&s;e names are not found in the Old Te&s;tament. And it is uncertain, whether St. Paul took them from &s;ome apo|cryphal writing then extant, or from tradi|tion. But no one ever imagined, that St. Paul is here a&s;&s;erting the authority of the writing, if it was a written account which he quoted, or making him&s;elf an&s;werable for the authenticity of the tradition; much le&s;s, that he &s;o involves him&s;elf with either
<PB N="310" REF="315">
of the&s;e que&s;tions, as that the credit of his own hi&s;tory and mi&s;&s;ion &s;hould depend upon the fact, whether "Jannes and Jam|bres with&s;tood Mo&s;es, or not." For what rea&s;on a more rigorous interpretation &s;hould be put upon other references, it is difficult to know. I do not mean, that other pa&s;&s;ages of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory &s;tand upon no better evidence than the hi&s;tory of Job, or of Jan|nes and Jambres (I think much otherwi&s;e); but I mean, that a reference in the New Te&s;tament, to a pa&s;&s;age in the Old, does not &s;o &s;ix its authority, as to exclude all enquiry into its credibility, or into the &s;e|parate rea&s;ons upon which that credibility is founded; and that it is an unwarrantable, as well as un&s;afe rule to lay down concern|ing the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, what was never laid down concerning any other, that either every particular of it mu&s;t be true, or the whole fal&s;e.</P>
<P>I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate this point explicitly, becau&s;e a fa&s;hion revived by Voltaire, and pur&s;ued by the di&s;ciples of his

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Rejection of Chri&s;tianity.</HEAD>
<P>WE acknowledge that the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, although it converted great numbers, did not produce an univer&s;al, or even a general conviction in the minds of men, of the age and countries in which it appeared. And this want of a more complete and ex|ten&s;ive &s;ucce&s;s, is called the <HI>rejection</HI> of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory and miracles; and has been thought by &s;ome, to form a &s;trong objec|tion to the reality of the facts which the hi&s;tory contains.</P>
<P>The matter of the objection divides it&s;elf into two parts, as it relates to the Jews, and as it relates to Heathen nations; be|cau&s;e the minds of the&s;e two de&s;criptions of men may have been, with re&s;pect to Chri&s;|tianity, under the influence of very different cau&s;es. The ca&s;e of the Jews, ina&s;much as
<PB N="313" REF="318">
our Saviour's mini&s;try was originally ad|dre&s;&s;ed to them, offers it&s;elf fir&s;t to our con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Now, upon the &s;ubject of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, with <HI>us</HI> there is but one que&s;tion, viz. whether the miracles were actually wrought? From acknowledging the miracles we pa&s;s in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to the ac|knowledgment of the whole. No doubt lies between the premi&s;es and the conclu|&s;ion. If we believe the works, or any one of them, we believe in Je&s;us. And this order of rea&s;oning is become &s;o univer&s;al and familiar, that we do not readily appre|hend how it could ever have been other|wi&s;e. Yet it appears to me perfectly cer|tain, that the &s;tate of thought, in the mind of a Jew of our Saviour's age, was totally different from this. After allowing the re|ality of the miracle, he had a great deal to do to per&s;uade him&s;elf that Je&s;us was the Me&s;&s;iah. This is clearly intimated by vari|ous pa&s;&s;ages of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory. It ap|pears that, in the apprehen&s;ion of the writers
<PB N="314" REF="319">
of the New Te&s;tament, the miracles did not irre&s;i&s;tibly carry, even tho&s;e who &s;aw them, to the conclu&s;ion intended to be drawn from them; or &s;o compel a&s;&s;ent, as to leave no room for &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for the exer|ci&s;e of candour, or the effects of prejudice. And to this point at lea&s;t, the evangeli&s;ts may be allowed to be good witne&s;&s;es; be|cau&s;e it is a point, in which exaggeration or di&s;gui&s;e would have been the other way. Their accounts, if they could be &s;u&s;pected of fal&s;ehood, would rather have magnified, than dimini&s;hed, the effects of the miracles.</P>
<P>John vii. 21&mdash;31. "Je&s;us an&s;wered, and &s;aid unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel&mdash;If a man on the Sabbath|day receive circumci&s;ion, that the law of Mo&s;es &s;hould not be broken, are ye angry at me, becau&s;e I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath-day? Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. Then &s;aid &s;ome of them of Jeru&s;alem, Is not this he whom they &s;eek to kill? but lo, he &s;peaketh boldly,
<PB N="315" REF="320">
and they &s;ay nothing to him; do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Chri&s;t? <HI>Howbeit we know this man, whence he is; but, when Chri&s;t cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</HI> Then cried Je&s;us in the tem|ple as he taught, &s;aying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am; and I am not come of my&s;elf, but he that &s;ent me is true, whom ye know not; but I know him, for I am from him, and he hath &s;ent me. Then they &s;ought to take him, but no man laid hands on him becau&s;e his hour was not yet come; <HI>and many of the people believed on him, and &s;aid, When Chri&s;t cometh, will he do more miracles than tho&s;e which this man hath done?"</HI></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age is very ob&s;ervable. It ex|hibits the rea&s;oning of different &s;orts of per|&s;ons upon the occa&s;ion of a miracle, which per&s;ons of all &s;orts are repre&s;ented to have acknowledged as real. One &s;ort of men thought, that there was &s;omething very ex|traordinary in all this; but that &s;till Je&s;us could not be the Chri&s;t, becau&s;e there was
<PB N="316" REF="321">
a circum&s;tance in his appearance, which mi|litated with an opinion concerning Chri&s;t, in which they had been brought up, and of the truth of which, it is probable, they had never entertained a particle of doubt, viz. that "when Chri&s;t cometh no man know|eth whence he is." Another &s;ort were in|clined to believe him to be the Me&s;&s;iah. But even the&s;e did not argue as we &s;hould; did not con&s;ider the miracle as of it&s;elf de|ci&s;ive of the que&s;tion, as what, if once al|lowed, excluded all farther debate upon the &s;ubject, but founded their opinion upon a kind of comparative rea&s;oning, "When Chri&s;t cometh, will he do <HI>more</HI> miracles than tho&s;e which this man hath done?"</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame evangeli&s;t, and ob&s;ervable for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, is that, in which he relates the re&s;urrection of La|zarus: "Je&s;us," he tells us, (xi. 43, 44.) "when he had thus &s;poken, cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth; and he, that was dead, came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his face was
<PB N="317" REF="322">
bound about with a napkin. Je&s;us faith unto them, Loo&s;e him and let him go." One might have expected, that at lea&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;tood by the &s;epulchre, when Lazarus was rai&s;ed, would have believed in Je&s;us. Yet the evangeli&s;t does not &s;o repre&s;ent it. "Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had &s;een the things which Je&s;us did, believed on him; but <HI>&s;ome of them</HI> went their ways to the Phari&s;ees, and told them what things Je&s;us had done." We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the evangeli&s;t meant, by this account, to leave his readers to imagine that any of the &s;pectators doubted about the truth of the miracle. Far from it. Unque&s;|tionably he &s;tates the miracle to have been fully allowed: yet the per&s;ons who allowed it, were, according to his repre&s;entation, ca|pable of retaining ho&s;tile &s;entiments towards Je&s;us. "Believing in Je&s;us" was not only to believe that he wrought miracles, but that he was the Me&s;&s;iah. With us there is no difference between the&s;e two things; with them there was the greate&s;t. And the dif|ference is apparent in this tran&s;action. If
<PB N="318" REF="323">
St. John has repre&s;ented the conduct of the Jews upon this occa&s;ion truly (and why he &s;hould not I cannot tell, for it rather makes again&s;t him than for him), it &s;hews clearly the principles upon which their judgment proceeded. Whether he has related the matter truly or not, the relation it&s;elf di&s;|covers the writer's own opinion of tho&s;e principles, and that alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es con&s;ider|able authority. In the next chapter, we have a reflection of the evangeli&s;t, entirely &s;uited to this &s;tate of the ca&s;e; "but though he had done &s;o many miracles before them, yet believed they not on him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xii. 37.</NOTE>." The evan|geli&s;t does not mean to impute the defect of their belief to any doubt about the mi|racles, but to their not perceiving, what all now &s;ufficiently perceive, and what they would have perceived had not their under|&s;tandings been governed by &s;trong preju|dices, the infallible atte&s;tation, which the works of Je&s;us bore, to the truth of his pre|ten&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="324">
The ninth chapter of St. John's go&s;pel contains a very circum&s;tantial account of the cure of a blind man; a miracle &s;ub|mitted to all the &s;crutiny and examination, which a &s;ceptic could propo&s;e. If a mo|dern unbeliever had drawn up the interro|gatories, they could hardly have been more critical or &s;earching. The account contains al&s;o a very curious conference between the Jewi&s;h rulers and the patient, in which the point for our pre&s;ent notice, is their re&s;i&s;t|ance of the force of the miracle, and of the conclu&s;ion to which it led, after they had failed in di&s;crediting its evidence. "We know that God &s;pake unto Mo&s;es, but as for this fellow we know not whence he is." That was the an&s;wer which &s;et their minds at re&s;t. And by the help of much prejudice, and great unwillingne&s;s to yield, it might do &s;o. In the mind of the poor man re|&s;tored to &s;ight, which was under no &s;uch bia&s;s, felt no &s;uch reluctance, the miracle had its natural operation. "Herein," &s;ays he, "is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, yet he hath opened
<PB N="320" REF="325">
mine eyes. Now we know that God hear|eth not &s;inners; but if any man be a wor|&s;hipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God he could do nothing." We do not find, that the Jewi&s;h rulers had any other reply to make to this defence, than that which authority is &s;ometimes apt to make to argument, "Do&s;t thou teach us?"</P>
<P>If it &s;hall be enquired how a turn of thought, &s;o different from what prevails at pre&s;ent, &s;hould obtain currency with the ancient Jews, the an&s;wer is found in two opinions, which are proved to have &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed in that age and country. The one was, their expectation of a Me&s;&s;iah, of a kind to|tally contrary to what the appearance of Je&s;us be&s;poke him to be: the other, their per&s;ua&s;ion of the agency of demons in the production of &s;upernatural effects. The&s;e opinions are not <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> by us for the pur|po&s;e of argument, but are evidently recogni&s;ed
<PB N="321" REF="326">
in the Jewi&s;h writings, as well as in ours. And it ought moreover to be con|&s;idered, that in the&s;e opinions the Jews of that age had been from their infancy brought up; that they were opinions, the grounds of which they had probably few of them enquired into, and of the truth of which they entertained no doubt. And I think that the&s;e two opinions conjointly af|ford an explanation of their conduct. The fir&s;t put them upon &s;eeking out &s;ome ex|cu&s;e to them&s;elves, for not receiving Je&s;us in the character in which he claimed to be received; and the &s;econd &s;upplied them with ju&s;t &s;uch an excu&s;e as they wanted. Let Je&s;us work what miracles he would, &s;till the an&s;wer was in readine&s;s, "that he wrought them by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Beelze|bub." And to this an&s;wer no reply could be made, but that which our Saviour did make, by &s;hewing that the tendency of his mi&s;&s;ion was &s;o adver&s;e to the views with which this Being was, by the objectors them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ed to act, that it could not rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would
<PB N="322" REF="327">
a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying it on. The power di&s;|played in the miracles did not alone refute the Jewi&s;h &s;olution, becau&s;e, the interpo&s;i|tion of invi&s;ible agents being once admitted, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the limits by which their efficiency is circum&s;cribed. We of this day may be di&s;po&s;ed, po&s;&s;ibly, to think &s;uch opinions too ab&s;urd to have been ever &s;eriou&s;ly entertained. I am not bound to contend for the credibility of the opinions. They were at lea&s;t as rea&s;onable as the belief in witchcraft. They were opi|nions in which the Jews of that age had from their infancy been in&s;tructed: and tho&s;e who cannot &s;ee enough in the force of this rea&s;on, to account for their conduct towards our Saviour, do not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider how &s;uch opinions may &s;ometimes become very general in a country, and with what pertinacity, when once become &s;o, they are, for that rea&s;on alone, adhered to. In the &s;u&s;pen&s;e which the&s;e notions, and the prejudices re&s;ulting from them, might occa&s;ion, the candid and docile and humble minded would probably decide in Chri&s;t's
<PB N="323" REF="328">
favour; the proud and ob&s;tinate, together with the giddy and the thoughtle&s;s, almo&s;t univer&s;ally again&s;t him.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of opinion di&s;covers to us al&s;o the rea&s;on of what &s;ome choo&s;e to wonder at, why the Jews &s;hould reject miracles when they &s;aw them, yet rely &s;o much upon the tradition of them in their own hi&s;tory. It does not appear, that it had ever entered into the minds of tho&s;e who lived in the time of Mo&s;es and the Prophets, to a&s;cribe <HI>their</HI> miracles to the &s;upernatural agency of evil Beings. The &s;olution was not then invented. And the authority of Mo&s;es and the Prophets being e&s;tabli&s;hed, and become the foundation of the national policy and religion, it was not probable that the later Jews, brought up in a reverence for that religion, and the &s;ubjects of that policy, &s;hould apply to their hi&s;tory a rea&s;oning which tended to overthrow the foundation of both.</P>
<P N="2">II. The infidelity of the gentile world,

The &s;tate of religion among&s;t the Greeks and Romans had a natural ten|dency to induce this di&s;po&s;ition. Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;en&s;is remarks, that there were &s;ix hundred different kinds of religions or &s;a|cred rites exerci&s;ed at Rome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jortin's remarks on Eccl.

Can we wonder then, that Chri&s;tianity was included in the number, without enquiry into its &s;eparate merits, or the particular grounds of its preten&s;ions? It might be either true or fal&s;e for any thing they knew about it. The religion had no|thing in its character which immediately engaged their notice. It mixed with no po|litics. It produced no fine writers. It con|tained no curious &s;peculations. When it did reach their knowledge, I doubt not but that
<PB N="325" REF="330">
it appeared to them a very &s;trange &s;y&s;tem&mdash;&s;o unphilo&s;ophical&mdash;dealing &s;o little in argu|ment and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch arguments however and di&s;cu&s;&s;ions as they were ac|cu&s;tomed to entertain. What is &s;aid of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of his nature, office, and mi|ni&s;try, would be, in the highe&s;t degree, aliene from the conceptions of their theo|logy. The redeemer, and the de&s;tined judge, of the human race, a poor young man exe|cuted at Jeru&s;alem with two thieves upon a cro&s;s! Still more would the language, in which the Chri&s;tian doctrine was delivered, be di&s;&s;onant and barbarous to their ears. What knew they of grace, of redemption, of ju&s;tification, of the blood of Chri&s;t &s;hed for the &s;ins of men, of reconcilement, of mediation? Chri&s;tianity was made up of points they had never thought of; of terms which they had never heard.</P>
<P>It was pre&s;ented al&s;o to the imagination of the learned heathen, under additional di&s;|advantage, by rea&s;on of its real, and &s;till more of its nominal, connection with Judai&s;m.
<PB N="326" REF="331">
It &s;hared in the obloquy and ridi|cule, with which that people and their reli|gion were treated by the Greeks and Ro|mans. They regarded Jehovah him&s;elf only as the idol of the Jewi&s;h nation, and what was related of him, as of a piece with what was told of the tutelar deities of other coun|tries: nay, the Jews were in a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous race; &s;o that whatever reports of a miraculous na|ture came out of that country, were looked upon by the heathen world as fal&s;e and fri|volous. When they heard of Chri&s;tianity, they heard of it as a quarrel among&s;t this people, about &s;ome articles of their own &s;u|per&s;tition. De&s;pi&s;ing therefore, as they did, the whole &s;y&s;tem, it was not probable that they would enter, with any degree of &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s or attention, into the detail of its di&s;putes, or the merits of either &s;ide. How little they knew, and with what carele&s;&s;ne&s;s they judged of the&s;e matters, appears, I think, pretty plainly from an example of no le&s;s weight than that of Tacitus, who, in a grave and profe&s;&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e upon the

hi&s;tory of the Jews, &s;tates that they wor|&s;hipped the effigy of an a&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tac. Hi&s;t. lib. v. c. 2.</NOTE>. The pa&s;&s;age is a proof, how prone the learned men of the&s;e times were, and upon how little evi|dence, to heap together &s;tories, which might increa&s;e the contempt and odium in which that people was held.

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that all the&s;e con&s;idera|tions are of a nature to operate with the greate&s;t force upon the highe&s;t ranks; upon men of education, and that order of the public from which <HI>writers</HI> are principally taken: I may add al&s;o, upon the philo&s;ophi|cal as well as the libertine character; upon the Antonines or Julian, not le&s;s than upon Nero or Domitian; and, more particularly, upon that large and poli&s;hed cla&s;s of men, who acquie&s;ced in the general per&s;ua&s;ion, that all they had to do was to practi&s;e the duties of morality, and to wor&s;hip the deity

<HI>more patrio;</HI> a habit of thinking, liberal as it may appear, which &s;huts the door again&s;t every argument for a new religion.

<P>Yet Chri&s;tianity was &s;till making its way: and, amid&s;t &s;o many impediments to its progre&s;s, &s;o much difficulty in procuring au|dience and attention, its actual &s;ucce&s;s is more to be wondered at, than that it &s;hould not have univer&s;ally conquered &s;corn and indifference, fixed the levity of a voluptu|ous age, or, through a cloud of adver&s;e pre|judications, opened for it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age to the hearts and under&s;tandings of the &s;cholars of the age.</P>
<P>And the cau&s;e which is here a&s;&s;igned for the rejection of Chri&s;tianity, by men of
<PB N="329" REF="334">
rank and learning among the heathens, namely, a &s;trong antecedent contempt, ac|counts al&s;o for their <HI>&s;ilence</HI> concerning it. If they had rejected it upon examination, they would have written about it. They would have given their rea&s;ons. Whereas what men repudiate upon the &s;trength of &s;ome prefixed per&s;ua&s;ion, or from a &s;ettled con|tempt of the &s;ubject, of the per&s;ons who propo&s;e it, or of the manner in which it is propo&s;ed, they do not naturally write books about, or notice much in what they write upon other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The letters of the younger Pliny furni&s;h an example of this &s;ilence, and let us, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, into the cau&s;e of it. From his celebrated corre&s;pondence with Trajan, we know that the Chri&s;tian religion pre|vailed in a very con&s;iderable degree in the province over which he pre&s;ided; that it had excited his attention; that he had enquired into the matter, ju&s;t &s;o much as a Roman magi&s;trate might be expected to enquire, viz. whether the religion contained any opinions
<PB N="330" REF="335">
dangerous~ to government; but that of its doctrines, its evidences, or its books, he had not taken the trouble to inform him|&s;elf with any degree of care or correctne&s;s. But although Pliny had viewed Chri&s;tianity in a nearer po&s;ition, than mo&s;t of his learn|ed countrymen &s;aw it in; yet he had re|garded the whole with &s;uch negligence and di&s;dain (farther than as it &s;eemed to concern his admini&s;tration), that, in more than two hundred and forty letters of his which have come down to us, the &s;ubject is never once again mentioned. If out of this number the two letters between him and Trajan had been lo&s;t, with what confidence would the ob&s;curity of the Chri&s;tian religion have been argued from Pliny's &s;ilence about it, and with how little truth?</P>
<P>The name and character which Tacitus hath given to Chri&s;tianity, "exitiabilis &s;u|per&s;titio" (a pernicious &s;uper&s;tition), and by which two words he di&s;po&s;es of the whole que&s;tion of the merits or demerits of the religion, afford a &s;trong proof how little
<PB N="331" REF="336">
he knew, or concerned him&s;elf to know, about the matter. I apprehend that I &s;hall not be contradicted, when I take upon me to a&s;&s;ert, that no unbeliever of the pre&s;ent age would apply this epithet to the Chri&s;|tianity of the New Te&s;tament, or not allow that it was entirely unmerited. Read the in&s;tructions given, by a great teacher of the religion, to tho&s;e very Roman converts, of whom Tacitus &s;peaks; and given al&s;o a very few years before the time of which he is &s;peaking; and which are not, let it be ob|&s;erved, a collection of fine &s;ayings, brought together from different parts of a large work, but &s;tand in one entire pa&s;&s;age of a public letter, without the intermixture of a &s;ingle thought, which is frivolous or exceptionable. "Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another.

<P>Read this, and then think of exitiabilis &s;uper&s;titio!!&mdash;Or if we be not allowed, in contending with heathen authorities, to pro|duce our books again&s;t theirs, we may at lea&s;t be permitted to confront theirs with one another.

<PB N="335" REF="340">
principles of the &s;ect? He di&s;covered no|thing, but that they were wont to meet to|gether on a &s;tated day before it was light, and &s;ing among them&s;elves a hymn to Chri&s;t as a God, and to bind them&s;elves by an oath, not to the commi&s;&s;ion of any wickedne&s;s, but not to be guilty of theft, robbery, or adultery; never to fal&s;ify their word, nor to deny a pledge committed to them, when called upon to return it.</P>
<P>Upon the words of Tacitus we may build the following ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That we are well warranted in call|ing the view, under which the learned men of that age beheld Chri&s;tianity, an ob&s;cure and di&s;tant view. Had Tacitus known more of Chri&s;tianity, of its precepts, duties, con&s;titu|tion or de&s;ign, however he had di&s;credited the &s;tory, he would have re&s;pected the prin|ciple. He would have de&s;cribed the reli|gion differently, though he had rejected it. It has been very &s;atisfactorily &s;hewn, that the "&s;uper&s;tition" of the Chri&s;tians con&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="336" REF="341">
in wor&s;hiping a per&s;on unknown to the Roman calendar; and that the "perniciou&s;|ne&s;s" with which they were reproached, was nothing el&s;e but there oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hed polythei&s;m: and this view of the matter was ju&s;t &s;uch a one as might be ex|pected to occur to a mind, which held the &s;ect in too much contempt to concern it&s;elf about the grounds and rea&s;ons of their con|duct.</P>
<P>Secondly, We may from hence remark, how little reliance can be placed upon the mo&s;t acute judgments, in &s;ubjects which they are plea&s;ed to de&s;pi&s;e; and which, of cour&s;e, they from the fir&s;t con&s;ider as unworthy to be enquired into. Had not Chri&s;tianity &s;ur|vived to tell its own &s;tory, it mu&s;t have gone down to po&s;terity as a "pernicious &s;uper&s;ti|tion;" and that upon the credit of Tacitus's account, much, I doubt not, &s;trengthened by the name of the writer, and the reputa|tion of his &s;agacity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this contempt prior to
<PB N="337" REF="342">
examination, is an intellectual vice, from which the greate&s;t faculties of mind are not free. I know not, indeed, whether men of the greate&s;t faculties of mind are not the mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. Such men feel them&s;elves &s;eated upon an eminence. Looking down from their height upon the follies of man|kind, they behold contending tenets wa&s;t|ing their idle &s;trength upon one another, with a common di&s;dain of the ab&s;urdity of them all. This habit of thought, however comfortable to the mind which entertains it, or however natural to great parts, is ex|tremely dangerous; and more apt, than al|mo&s;t any other di&s;po&s;ition, to produce ha&s;ty and contemptuous, and, by con&s;equence, erroneous judgments, both of per&s;ons and opinions.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We need not be &s;urpri&s;ed at many writers of that age not mentioning Chri&s;tianity at all, when they, who did men|tion it, appear to have entirely mi&s;conceived its nature and character; and, in con&s;equence
<PB N="338" REF="343">
of this mi&s;conception, to have re|garded it with negligence and contempt.</P>
<P>To the knowledge of the greate&s;t part of the learned heathens, the facts of the Chri&s;|tian hi&s;tory could only come by report. The books, probably, they had never look|ed into. The &s;ettled habit of their minds was, and long had been, an indi&s;criminate rejection of all reports of the kind. With the&s;e &s;weeping conclu&s;ions truth hath no chance. It depends upon di&s;tinction. If they would not enquire, how &s;hould they be convinced? It might be founded in truth, though they, who made no &s;earch, might not di&s;cover it.</P>
<Q>"Men of rank and fortune, of wit and abilities, are often found, even in Chri&s;tian countries, to be &s;urpri&s;ingly ignorant of re|ligion, and of every thing that relates to it. Such were many of the heathens. Their thoughts were all fixed upon other things, upon reputation and glory, upon wealth and
<PB N="339" REF="344">
power, upon luxury and plea&s;ure, upon bu|&s;ine&s;s or learning. They thought, and they had rea&s;on to think, that the religion of their country was fable and forgery, an heap of incon&s;i&s;tent lies, which inclined them to &s;uppo&s;e that other religions were no better. Hence it came to pa&s;s, that when the Apo|&s;tles preached the go&s;pel, and wrought mi|racles in confirmation of a doctrine every way worthy of God, many Gentiles knew little or nothing of it, and would not take the lea&s;t pains to inform them&s;elves about it. This appears plainly from ancient hi&s;|tory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jortin's Di&s;. on the Chri&s;. Rel. p. 66, ed. 4th.</NOTE>."</Q>
<P>I think it by no means unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the heathen public, e&s;pecially that part which is made up of men of rank and education, were divided into two cla&s;&s;es; tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;ed Chri&s;tianity beforehand, and tho&s;e who received it. In corre&s;pond|ency with which divi&s;ion of character, the
<PB N="340" REF="345">
writers of that age would al&s;o be of two cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who were &s;ilent about Chri&s;ti|anity, and tho&s;e who were Chri&s;tians. "A good man, who attended &s;ufficiently to the Chri&s;tian affairs, would become a Chri&s;tian; after which his te&s;timony cea&s;ed to be Pa|gan, and became Chri&s;tian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hartley, Ob&s;. p. 119.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that I think it &s;ufficient|ly proved, that the notion of magic was re&s;orted to by the heathen adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity, in like manner as that of diabo|lical agency had before been by the Jews. Ju&s;tin Martyr alledges this as his rea&s;on for arguing from prophecy, rather than from miracles. Origen imputes this eva&s;ion to Cel&s;us; Jerome to Porphyry; and Lactan|tius to the heathen in general. The &s;eve|ral pa&s;&s;ages, which contain the&s;e te&s;timonies, will be produced in the next chapter. It be|ing difficult however to a&s;certain, in what de|gree this notion prevailed, e&s;pecially among&s;t
<PB N="341" REF="346">
the &s;uperior ranks of the heathen communi|ties, another, and I think an adequate cau&s;e, has been a&s;&s;igned for their infidelity. It is probable that in many ca&s;es the two cau&s;es would operate together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. That the Chri&s;tian miracles are not recited, or appealed to, by early Chri&s;tian writers them&s;elves, &s;o fully or frequently as might have been expected.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL con&s;ider this objection, fir&s;t, as it applies to the letters of the Apo&s;tles, pre|&s;erved in the New Te&s;tament; and &s;econdly, as it applies to the remaining writings of other early Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The epi&s;tles of the apo&s;tles are either hor|tatory or argumentative. So far as they were occupied, in delivering le&s;&s;ons of duty, rules of public order, admonitions again&s;t cer|tain prevailing corruptions, again&s;t vice, or any particular &s;pecies of it, or in fortifying and encouraging the con&s;tancy of the di&s;|ciples under the trials to which they were expo&s;ed, there appears to be no place or
<PB N="343" REF="348">
occa&s;ion for more of the&s;e references than we actually find.</P>
<P>So far as the epi&s;tles are argumentative, the nature of the argument which they handle, accounts for the infrequency of the&s;e allu&s;ions. The&s;e epi&s;tles were not written to prove the truth of Chri&s;tianity. The &s;ubject under con&s;ideration was not that which the miracles decided, the reality of our Lord's mi&s;&s;ion; but it was that which the miracles did not decide, the nature of his per&s;on or power, the de&s;ign of his ad|vent, its effects, and of tho&s;e effects the va|lue, kind, and extent. Still I maintain, that miraculous evidence lies at the bottom of the argument. For nothing could be &s;o prepo&s;terous, as for the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us to di&s;pute among&s;t them&s;elves, or with others, concerning his office or character, unle&s;s they believed that he had &s;hewn, by &s;uperna|tural proofs, that there was &s;omething extra|ordinary in both. Miraculous evidence, therefore, forming not the texture of the&s;e

arguments, but the ground and &s;ub&s;tratum, if it be occa&s;ionally di&s;cerned, if it be inci|dentally appealed to, it is exactly &s;o much as ought to take place, &s;uppo&s;ing the hi&s;tory to be true.</P>
<P>As a further an&s;wer to the objection, that the apo&s;tolic epi&s;tles do not contain &s;o fre|quent, or &s;uch direct and circum&s;tantial re|citals of miracles as might be expected, I would add, <HI>that the apo&s;tolic epi&s;tles re&s;emble in this re&s;pect the apo&s;tolic &s;peeches,</HI> which &s;peeches are given by a writer, who di&s;|tinctly records numerous miracles wrought by the&s;e apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and by the founder of the in&s;titution in their pre&s;ence; that it is unwarrantable to contend, that the omi&s;&s;ion, or infrequency, of &s;uch recitals in the &s;peeches of the apo&s;tles, negatives the exi&s;tence of the miracles, when the &s;peeches are given in immediate conjunction with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e miracles; and that a conclu|&s;ion which cannot be inferred from the &s;peeches, without contradicting the whole
<PB N="345" REF="350">
tenor of the book which contains them, can|not be inferred from letters, which, in this re&s;pect, are &s;imilar only to the &s;peeches.</P>
<P>To prove the &s;imilitude which we alledge, it may be remarked, that although in St. Luke's go&s;pel, the apo&s;tle Peter is repre&s;ent|ed to have been pre&s;ent at many deci&s;ive miracles wrought by Chri&s;t; and although the &s;econd part of the &s;ame hi&s;tory a&s;cribes other deci&s;ive miracles to Peter him&s;elf, par|ticularly the cure of the lame man at the gate of the temple (Acts iii. 1.), the death of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts v. 1.), the cure of Aeneas (Acts ix. 40.), the re&s;ur|rection of Dorcas (Acts ix. 34.); yet out of &s;ix &s;peeches of Peter, pre&s;erved in the Acts, I know but two, in which reference is made to the miracles wrought by Chri&s;t, and only one in which he refers to miraculous powers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf. In his &s;peech upon the day of Penteco&s;t, Peter addre&s;&s;es his audience with great &s;olemnity thus: "Ye men of I&s;rael, hear the&s;e words; Je&s;us of Nazareth, a man approved of God among
<PB N="346" REF="351">
you, by miracles and wonders and &s;igns, which God did by him in the mid&s;t of you, as ye your&s;elves al&s;o know, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 22.</NOTE>" In his &s;peech upon the conver&s;ion of Cornelius, he delivers his te&s;timony to the miracles per|formed by Chri&s;t in the&s;e words: "We are witne&s;&s;es of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jeru&s;alem <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">x. 39.</NOTE>." But in this latter &s;peech no allu&s;ion appears to the miracles wrought by him&s;elf, notwith|&s;tanding that the miracles above enumerat|ed, all preceded the time in which it was delivered. In his &s;peech upon the election of Matthias <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">i. 15.</NOTE>, no di&s;tinct reference is made to any of the miracles of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory, ex|cept his re&s;urrection. The &s;ame al&s;o may be ob&s;erved of his &s;peech upon the cure of the lame man at the gate of the temple <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">iii. 12.</NOTE>; the &s;ame in his &s;peech before the Sanhedrim <NOTE N="&Barline;" PLACE="foot">iv. 9.</NOTE>; the &s;ame in his &s;econd apology in the pre|&s;ence of that a&s;&s;embly. Stephen's long &s;peech contains no reference whatever to
<PB N="347" REF="352">
miracles, though it be expre&s;sly related of him, in the book which pre&s;erves the &s;peech, and almo&s;t immediately before the &s;peech, "that he did great wonders and miracles among the people <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts vi. 8.</NOTE>." Again, although miracles be expre&s;sly attributed to St. Paul in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, fir&s;t generally, as at Iconium (Acts xiv. 3.), during the whole tour through the Upper A&s;ia (xiv. 27. xv. 12.), at Ephe&s;us (xix. 11, 12.); &s;e|condly, in &s;pecific in&s;tances, as the blindne&s;s of Elymas at Paphos <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xiii. 7.</NOTE>, the cure of the crip|ple at Ly&s;tra <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">xiv. 8.</NOTE>, of the Pythone&s;s at Phi|lippi <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">xvi. 16.</NOTE>, the miraculous liberation from pri|&s;on in the &s;ame city <NOTE N="&Barline;" PLACE="foot">xvi. 26.</NOTE>, the re&s;toration of Eutychus <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">xx. 10.</NOTE>, the predictions of his &s;hip|wreck <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">xxvii. 1.</NOTE>, the viper at Milita <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xxviii. 6.</NOTE>, the cure of Publius's father <NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">xxviii. 8.</NOTE>; at all which miracles, except the two fir&s;t, the hi&s;torian him&s;elf was pre&s;ent: notwith&s;tanding, I &s;ay, this po&s;itive a&s;cription of miracles to St. Paul, yet in the &s;peeches delivered by him, and given as delivered
<PB N="348" REF="353">
by him, in the &s;ame book in which the miracles are related, and the miraculous powers a&s;&s;erted, the appeals to his own mi|racles, or indeed to any miracles at all, are rare and incidental. In his &s;peech at An|tioch in Pi&s;idia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 16.</NOTE>, there is no allu&s;ion, but to the re&s;urrection.

<P>Agreeably hereunto, in thirteen letters a&s;cribed to St. Paul, we have ince&s;&s;ant refe|rences to Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, frequent re|ferences to his own conver&s;ion, three indu|bitable references to the miracles which he wrought <NOTE N="&Barline;" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 5.

<PB N="349" REF="354">
&s;ufficiently exact: and the rea&s;on in both is the &s;ame; namely, that the miraculous hi&s;|tory was all along <HI>pre&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> and that the que&s;tion, which occupied the &s;peaker's and the writer's thoughts, was this: whether, allowing the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us to be true, he was, upon the &s;trength of it, to be received as the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah; and, if he was, what were the con&s;equences, what was the object and benefit of his mi&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>The general ob&s;ervation which has been made upon the apo&s;tolic writings, namely, that the &s;ubject, of which they treated, did not lead them to any direct recital of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, belongs al&s;o to the writ|ings of the apo&s;tolic fathers. The epi&s;tle of Barnabas is, in its &s;ubject and general compo&s;ition, much like the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews; an allegorical application of di|vers pa&s;&s;ages of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, of their law and ritual, to tho&s;e parts of the Chri&s;|tian di&s;pen&s;ation, in which the author per|ceived a re&s;emblance. The epi&s;tle of Cle|ment was written for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of
<PB N="350" REF="355">
quieting certain di&s;&s;en&s;ions that had ari&s;en among&s;t the members of the church of Co|rinth; and of reviving, in their minds, that temper and &s;pirit of which their predece&s;&s;ors in the go&s;pel had left them an example. The work of Hermas is a vi&s;ion; quotes neither the Old Te&s;tament nor the New; and merely falls now and then into the lan|guage, and the mode of &s;peech, which the author had read in our go&s;pels. The epi&s;tles of Polycarp and Ignatius had, for their prin|cipal object, the order and di&s;cipline of the churches which they addre&s;&s;ed. Yet, un|der all the&s;e circum&s;tances of di&s;advantage, the great points of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory are fully recognized.

<P>There is, however, another cla&s;s of wri|ters, to whom the an&s;wer above given, viz. the un&s;uitablene&s;s of any &s;uch appeals or references as the objection demands to the &s;ubjects of which the writings treated, does

not apply; and that is, the cla&s;s of ancient <HI>apologi&s;ts,</HI> who&s;e declared de&s;ign it was, to defend Chri&s;tianity, and to give the rea&s;ons of their adherence to it. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to enquire how the matter of the objection &s;tands in the&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ancient apologi&s;t, of who&s;e works we have the &s;malle&s;t knowledge, is Quadratus. Quadratus lived about &s;eventy years after the a&s;cen&s;ion, and pre&s;ented his apology to the emperor Adrian. From a pa&s;&s;age of this work, pre&s;erved in Eu&s;ebius, it appears that the author did directly and formally appeal to the miracles of Chri&s;t, and in terms as expre&s;s and con&s;ident as we could de&s;ire. The pa&s;&s;age (which has been once already &s;tated) is as follows: "The works of our Saviour were always con&s;picu|ous, for they were real; both they that were healed, and they that were rai&s;ed from the dead, were &s;een, not only when they were healed or rai&s;ed, but for a long time after|wards; not only whil&s;t he dwelled on this earth, but al&s;o after his departure, and for a
<PB N="352" REF="357">
good while after it; in&s;omuch as that &s;ome of them have reached to our times <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;. Hi&s;t. l. iv. c. 3.</NOTE>." No|thing can be more rational or &s;atisfactory than this.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tin Martyr, the next of the Chri&s;tian apologi&s;ts who&s;e work is not lo&s;t, and who followed Quadratus at the di&s;tance of about thirty years, has touched upon pa&s;&s;ages of Chri&s;t's hi&s;tory in &s;o many places, that a tolerably complete account of Chri&s;t's life might be collected out of his works. In the following quotation, he a&s;&s;erts the perform|ance of miracles by Chri&s;t, in words as &s;trong and po&s;itive as the language po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es: "Chri&s;t healed tho&s;e who from their birth were blind, and deaf, and lame; cau&s;ing by his word, one to leap, another to hear, and a third to &s;ee: and having rai&s;ed the dead, and cau&s;ed them to live, he by his works excited attention, and induced the men of that age to know him. Who, however, &s;ee|ing the&s;e things done, &s;aid that it was a
<PB N="353" REF="358">
magical appearance; and dared to call him a magician, and a deceiver of the people <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;t. dial. p. 258. ed. Thirlby.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t apology <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ap. prim. p. 48. ib.</NOTE>, Ju&s;tin expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igns the rea&s;on for his having recour&s;e to the argument from prophecy, rather than alledging the miracles of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;|tory: which rea&s;on was, that the per&s;ons with whom he contended would a&s;cribe the&s;e miracles to magic; "le&s;t any of our opponents &s;hould &s;ay, What hinders, but that he who is called Chri&s;t by us, being a man &s;prung from men, performed the mi|racles which we attributed to him by magi|cal art." The &s;ugge&s;ting of this rea&s;on meets, as I apprehend, the very point of the pre&s;ent objection; more e&s;pecially when we find Ju&s;tin followed in it, by other writers of that age. Irenaeus, who came about forty years after him, notices the &s;ame eva&s;ion in the adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity, and re|plies to it by the &s;ame argument: "But, if
<PB N="354" REF="359">
they &s;hall &s;ay, that the Lord performed the&s;e things by an illu&s;ory appearance <GAP DESC="foreign">, leading the&s;e objectors to the prophecies, we will &s;hew from them, that all things were thus predicted concerning him, and &s;trictly came to pa&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ir. l. ii. c. 57.</NOTE>." Lactan|tius, who lived a century lower, delivers the &s;ame &s;entiment, upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion. "He performed miracles&mdash;we might have &s;uppo&s;ed him to have been a magician, as ye &s;ay, and as the Jews then &s;uppo&s;ed, if all the prophets had not with one &s;pirit fore|told that Chri&s;t would perform the&s;e very things <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lact. v. 3.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>But to return to the Chri&s;tian apologi&s;ts in their order; Tertullian&mdash;"That per&s;on whom the Jews had vainly imagined, from the meanne&s;s of his appearance, to be a mere man, they afterwards, in con&s;equence of the power he exerted, con&s;idered as a magician, when he, with one word, ejected devils out of the bodies of men, gave &s;ight
<PB N="355" REF="360">
to the blind, clean&s;ed the leprous, &s;trengthen|ed the nerves of tho&s;e that had the pal&s;y, and la&s;tly, with one command, re&s;tored the dead to life; when he, I &s;ay, made the very elements obey him, a&s;&s;uaged the &s;torms, walked upon the &s;eas, demon&s;trating him|&s;elf to be the word of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tertull. Apolog. p. 20. ed. Priorii Par. 1675.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Next in the catalogue of profe&s;&s;ed apolo|gi&s;ts we may place Origen, who, it is well known, publi&s;hed a formal defence of Chri&s;|tianity, in an&s;wer to Cel&s;us, a heathen, who had written a di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t it. I know no expre&s;&s;ions, by which a plainer or more po&s;itive appeal to the Chri&s;tian miracles can be made, than the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by Ori|gen; "Undoubtedly we do think him to be the Chri&s;t, and the Son of God, becau&s;e he healed the lame and the blind; and we are the more confirmed in this per&s;ua&s;ion, by what is written in the prophecies, Then &s;hall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf &s;hall hear, and the lame men &s;hall
<PB N="356" REF="361">
leap as an hart. But that he al&s;o rai&s;ed the dead, and that it is not a fiction of tho&s;e who wrote the Go&s;pels, is evident from hence, that, if it had been a fiction, there would have been many recorded to be rai&s;ed up, and &s;uch as had been a long time in their graves. But, it not being a fiction, few have been recorded; for in&s;tance, the daugh|ter of the ruler of a &s;ynagogue, of whom I do not know why he &s;aid, &s;he is not dead but &s;leepeth, expre&s;&s;ing &s;omething peculiar to her, not common to all dead per&s;ons; and the only &s;on of a widow, on whom he had compa&s;&s;ion, and rai&s;ed him to life, after he had bid the bearer of the corp&s;e to &s;top; and the third Lazarus, who had been buried four days." This is po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ert the miracles of Chri&s;t, and it is al&s;o to comment upon them, and that with a con&s;iderable de|gree of accuracy and candour.</P>
<P>In another pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or. con. Cel&s;. lib. ii. &s;ec. 48.</NOTE>, we meet with the old &s;olution of magic
<PB N="357" REF="362">
applied to the miracles of Chri&s;t by the ad|ver&s;aries of the religion. "Cel&s;us," faith Origen, "well knowing what great works may be alledged to have been done by Je&s;us, pretends to grant that the things related of him are true; &s;uch as healing di&s;ea&s;es, rai&s;ing the dead, feeding multitudes with a few loaves, of which large fragments were left." And then Cel&s;us gives, it &s;eems, an an&s;wer to the&s;e proofs of our Lord's mi&s;&s;ion, which, as Origen under&s;tood it, re&s;olved the pheno|mena into magic; for Origen begins his re|ply, by ob&s;erving, "You &s;ee that Cel&s;us in a manner allows that there is &s;uch a thing as magic <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lard. Jewi&s;h and Heath. Te&s;t. vol. ii. p. 294, ed. quarto.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o from the te&s;timony of St. Jerome, that Porphyry, the mo&s;t learned and able of the heathen writers again&s;t Chri&s;ti|anity, re&s;orted to the &s;ame &s;olution: "Un|le&s;s," &s;ays he, &s;peaking to Vigilantius, "ac|cording to the manner of the Gentiles, and
<PB N="358" REF="363">
the profane, of <HI>Porphyry</HI> and Eunomius, you pretend that the&s;e are the tricks of de|mons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerome con. Vigil.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This magic, the&s;e demons, this illu&s;ory appearance, this compari&s;on with the tricks of jugglers, by which many of that age ac|counted &s;o ea&s;ily for the Chri&s;tian miracles, and which an&s;wers, the advocates of Chri&s;|tianity often thought it nece&s;&s;ary to refute, by arguments drawn from other topics, and particularly from prophecy (to which, it &s;eems, the&s;e &s;olutions did not apply), we now perceive to be gro&s;s &s;ubterfuges. That &s;uch rea&s;ons were ever &s;eriou&s;ly urged, and &s;eri|ou&s;ly received, is only a proof, what a glo&s;s and varni&s;h fa&s;hion can give to any opi|nion.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that the miracles of Chri&s;t, under&s;tood, as we under&s;tand them, in their literal and hi&s;torical &s;en&s;e, were po|&s;itively and preci&s;ely a&s;&s;erted and appealed
<PB N="359" REF="364">
to by the apologi&s;ts for Chri&s;tianity; which an&s;wers the allegation of the objection.</P>
<P>I am ready, however, to admit, that the ancient Chri&s;tian advocates did not in&s;i&s;t upon the miracles in argument, &s;o frequently as I &s;hould have done. It was their lot to contend with notions of magical agency, again&s;t which the mere production of the facts was not &s;ufficient for the convincing of their adver&s;aries: I do not know whether they them&s;elves thought it quite deci&s;ive of the controver&s;y. But &s;ince it is proved, I conceive, with certainty, that the &s;paring|ne&s;s with which they appealed to miracles, was owing neither to their ignorance, nor their doubt of the facts, it is, at any rate, an objection, not to the truth of the hi&s;tory, but to the judgment of its defenders.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Want of univer&s;ality in the knowledge and re|ception of Chri&s;tianity, and of greater clear|ne&s;s in the evidence.</HEAD>
<P N="1">OF a revelation which really came from God, the proof, it has been &s;aid, would in all ages be &s;o public and manife&s;t, that no part of the human &s;pecies would remain ig|norant of it, no under&s;tanding could fail of being convinced by it.</P>
<P>The advocates of Chri&s;tianity do not pre|tend that the evidence of their religion po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e qualities. They do not deny, that we can conceive it to be within the compa&s;s of divine power, to have commu|nicated to the world a higher degree of a&s;|&s;urance, and to have given to his communi|cation a &s;tronger and more exten&s;ive influ|ence. For any thing we are able to di&s;cern,
<PB N="361" REF="366">
God <HI>could</HI> have &s;o formed men, as to have perceived the truths of religion intuitively; or to have carried on a communication with the other world, whil&s;t they lived in this; or to have &s;een the individuals of the &s;pe|cies, in&s;tead of dying, pa&s;s to heaven by a &s;en&s;ible tran&s;lation. He could have pre|&s;ented a &s;eparate miracle to each man's &s;en&s;es. He could have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;tanding miracle. He could have cau&s;ed miracles to be wrought in every different age and coun|try. The&s;e, and many more methods, which we may imagine, if we once give loo&s;e to our imaginations, are, &s;o far as we can judge, all practicable.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, therefore, is not, whether Chri&s;tianity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible de|gree of evidence, but whether the not hav|ing more evidence be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for rejecting that which we have.</P>
<P>Now there appears to be no fairer method of judging, concerning any di&s;pen&s;ation which is alledged to come from God, when
<PB N="362" REF="367">
a que&s;tion is made whether &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;a|tion could come from God or not, than by comparing it with other things, which are acknowledged to proceed from the &s;ame council, and to be produced by the &s;ame agency. If the di&s;pen&s;ation in que&s;tion la|bour under no defects but what apparently belong to other di&s;pen&s;ations, the&s;e &s;eeming defects do not ju&s;tify us, in &s;etting a&s;ide the proofs which are offered of its authenticity, if they be otherwi&s;e entitled to credit.</P>
<P>Throughout that order then of nature, of which God is the author, what we find is a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>beneficence,</HI> we are &s;eldom or ever able to make out a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>optimi&s;m.</HI> I mean, that there are few ca&s;es in which, if we permit our&s;elves to range in po&s;&s;ibili|ties, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething more per|fect, and more unobjectionable, than what we &s;ee. The rain which de&s;cends from hea|ven is confe&s;&s;edly among&s;t the contrivances of the Creator, for the &s;u&s;tentation of the animals and vegetables which &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the &s;urface of the earth. Yet how partially
<PB N="363" REF="368">
and irregularly is it &s;upplied? How much of it falls upon the &s;ea, where it can be of no u&s;e; how often is it wanted where it would be of the greate&s;t? What tracts of continent are rendered de&s;arts by the &s;carci|ty of it? Or, not to &s;peak of extreme ca&s;es, how much, &s;ometimes, do inhabited coun|tries &s;uffer by its deficiency or delay?&mdash;We could imagine, if to imagine were our bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the matter to be otherwi&s;e regulated. We could imagine &s;howers to fall, ju&s;t where and when they would do good; al|ways &s;ea&s;onable, everywhere &s;ufficient; &s;o di&s;tributed as not to leave a field upon the face of the globe &s;corched by drought, or even a plant withering for the lack of moi&s;|ture. Yet does the difference between the real ca&s;e and the imagined ca&s;e, or the &s;eeming inferiority of the one to the other, authorize us to &s;ay, that the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the atmo&s;phere is not among&s;t the productions or the de&s;igns of the Deity. Does it check the inference which we draw from the confe&s;&s;ed beneficence of the provi&s;ion? or does it make us cea&s;e to admire the contrivance?&mdash;
<PB N="364" REF="369">
The ob&s;ervation, which we have exemplified in the &s;ingle in&s;tance of the rain of heaven, may be repeated concerning mo&s;t of the phe|nomena of nature: and the true conclu&s;ion to which it leads is this, that to enquire what the Deity might have done, could have done, or, as we even &s;ometimes pre&s;ume to &s;peak, ought to have done, or, in hypothetical ca&s;es, would have done, and to build any propo|&s;itions upon &s;uch enquiries again&s;t evidence of facts, is wholly unwarrantable. It is a mode of rea&s;oning, which will not do in na|tural hi&s;tory, which will not do in natural religion, which cannot therefore be applied with &s;afety to revelation. It may have &s;ome foundation, in certain &s;peculative <HI>apriori</HI> ideas of the divine attributes; but it has none in experience, or in analogy. The general cha|racter of the works of nature is, on the one hand, goodne&s;s both in de&s;ign and effect; and, on the other hand, a liability to diffi|culty, and to objections, if &s;uch objections be allowed, by rea&s;on of &s;eeming incom|pletene&s;s or uncertainty in attaining their end.

The true &s;imilitude between nature and revelation con&s;i&s;ts in this; that they each bear &s;trong marks of their original; that they each al&s;o bear appearances of irre|gularity and defect. A &s;y&s;tem of &s;trict optimi&s;m may neverthele&s;s be the real &s;y&s;tem in both ca&s;es. But what I contend is, that the proof is hidden from <HI>us;</HI> that we ought not to expect to perceive that in revelation, which we hardly perceive in any thing; that beneficence, of which we <HI>can</HI> judge, ought to &s;atisfy us, that optimi&s;m, of which we <HI>can|not</HI> judge, ought not to be &s;ought after. We can judge of beneficence, becau&s;e it de|pends upon effects which we experience, and upon the relation between the means which we &s;ee acting, and the ends which we &s;ee produced. We cannot judge of op|timi&s;m, becau&s;e it nece&s;&s;arily implies a com|pari&s;on of that which is tried, with that which is not tried; of con&s;equences which we &s;ee, with others which we imagine, and concerning many of which, it is more than probable we know nothing; concerning &s;ome, that we have no notion.</P>

If Chri&s;tianity be compared with the &s;tate and progre&s;s of natural religion, the argu|ment of the objector will gain nothing by the compari&s;on. I remember hearing an unbeliever &s;ay, that, if God had given a re|velation, he would have written it in the &s;kies. Are the truths of natural religion writ|ten in the &s;kies, or in a language which every one reads? or is this the ca&s;e with the mo&s;t u&s;eful arts, or the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;ciences of human life? An Otaheitean or an E&s;qui|maux knows nothing of Chri&s;tianity; does he know more of the principles of dei&s;m or morality? which, notwith&s;tanding his igno|rance, are neither untrue, nor unimportant, nor uncertain. The exi&s;tence of the Deity is left to be collected from ob&s;ervations, which every man does not make, which every man, perhaps, is not capable of mak|ing. Can it be argued, that God does not exi&s;t, becau&s;e, if he did, he would let us &s;ee him; or di&s;cover him&s;elf to mankind by proofs (&s;uch as, we may think, the nature of the &s;ubject merited), which no inadvertency could mi&s;s, no prejudice with&s;tand?</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="372">
If Chri&s;tianity be regarded as a providen|tial in&s;trument for the melioration of man|kind, its progre&s;s and diffu&s;ion re&s;embles that of other cau&s;es, by which human life is improved. The diver&s;ity is not greater, nor the advance more &s;low in religion, than we find it to be in learning, liberty, government, laws. The Deity hath not touched the or|der of nature in vain. The Jewi&s;h religion produced great and permanent effects: the Chri&s;tian religion hath done the &s;ame. It hath di&s;po&s;ed the world to amendment. It hath put things in a train. It is by no means improbable, that it may become uni|ver&s;al; and that the world may continue in that &s;tate &s;o long as that the duration of its reign may bear a va&s;t proportion to the time of its partial influence.</P>
<P>When we argue concerning Chri&s;tianity, that it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be true, becau&s;e it is beneficial, we go perhaps too far on one &s;ide: and we certainly go too far on the other, when we conclude that it mu&s;t be fal&s;e, be|cau&s;e it is not &s;o efficacious as we could have
<PB N="368" REF="373">
&s;uppo&s;ed. The que&s;tion of its truth is to be tried upon its proper evidence, without de|ferring much to this &s;ort of argument, on either &s;ide. "The evidence," as Bi&s;hop Butler hath rightly ob&s;erved, "depends up|on the judgment we form of human con|duct, under given circum&s;tances, of which it may be pre&s;umed that we know &s;omething; the objection &s;tands upon the &s;uppo&s;ed con|duct of the Deity, under relations with which we are not acquainted."</P>
<P>What would be the real effect of that over|powering evidence which our adver&s;aries re|quire in a revelation, it is difficult to foretell; at lea&s;t, we mu&s;t &s;peak of it as of a di&s;pen|&s;ation, of which we have no experience. Some con&s;equences however would, it is pro|bable, attend this oeconomy, which do not &s;eem to be&s;it a revelation that proceeded from God. One is, that irre&s;i&s;tible proof would re&s;train the voluntary powers too much; would not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of trial and probation; would call for no exerci&s;e of candour, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, humility, enquiry; no

&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ions, intere&s;ts, and preju|dices, to moral evidence and to probable truth; no habits of reflection; none of that previous de&s;ire to learn, and to obey the will of God, which forms perhaps the te&s;t of the virtuous principle, and which induces men to attend, with care and reverence, to every credible intimation of that will, and to re&s;ign pre&s;ent advantages and pre&s;ent plea|&s;ures to every rea&s;onable expectation of pro|pitiating his favour. "Men's moral proba|tion may be, whether they will take due care to inform them&s;elves by impartial con|&s;ideration; and, afterwards, whether they will act as the ca&s;e requires, upon the evi|dence which they have.

<P N="2">II. The&s;e modes of communication would leave no place for the admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>internal evidence;</HI> which ought, perhaps, to bear a con&s;iderable part in the proof of every revelation,
<PB N="370" REF="375">
becau&s;e it is a &s;pecies of evidence, which applies it&s;elf to the knowledge, love, and practice of virtue, and which operates in proportion to the degree of tho&s;e quali|ties which it finds in the per&s;on whom it ad|dre&s;&s;es. Men of good di&s;po&s;itions, among&s;t Chri&s;tians, are greatly affected by the im|pre&s;&s;ion which the &s;criptures them&s;elves make upon their minds. Their conviction is much &s;trengthened by the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions. And this perhaps was intended to be one ef|fect to be produced by the religion. It is likewi&s;e true, to whatever cau&s;e we a&s;cribe it (for I am not in this work at liberty to in|troduce the Chri&s;tian doctrine of grace or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or the Chri&s;tian promi&s;e, "that, if any man will do his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vii. 17.</NOTE>,")&mdash;it is true, I &s;ay, that they who &s;incerely act, or &s;incerely endeavour to act, <HI>according</HI> to what they believe, that is, according to the ju&s;t re&s;ult of the probabilities, or, if you plea&s;e, the po&s;&s;ibilities in natural and revealed
<PB N="371" REF="376">
religion, which they them&s;elves perceive, and according to a rational e&s;timate of con&s;e|quences, and, above all, according to the ju&s;t effect of tho&s;e principles of gratitude and de|votion, which even the view of nature ge|nerates in a well-ordered mind, <HI>&s;eldom fail of proceeding farther.</HI> This al&s;o may have been exactly what was de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Whereas may it not be &s;aid, that irre&s;i&s;t|ible evidence would confound all characters, and all di&s;po&s;itions? would &s;ubvert, rather than promote, the true purpo&s;e of the divine councils, which is not to produce <HI>obedience</HI> by a force little &s;hort of mechanical con|&s;traint (which obedience would be regula|rity not virtue, and would hardly perhaps differ from that which inanimate bodies pay to the laws impre&s;&s;ed upon their nature), but to treat moral agents agreeably to what they are; which is done, when light and mo|tives are of &s;uch kinds, and are imparted in &s;uch mea&s;ures, that the influence of them depends upon the recipients them&s;elves? "It is not meet to govern rational free agents

That &s;piritual vi&s;ion and fruition is our &s;tate in patri&acirc;." (Baxter's Rea&s;ons, p. 357.) There may be truth in this thought, though roughly expre&s;&s;ed. Few things are more improbable than that we (the human &s;pecies) &s;hould be the high|e&s;t order of beings in the univer&s;e; that ani|mated nature &s;hould a&s;cend from the lowe&s;t reptile to us, and all at once &s;top there. If there be cla&s;&s;es above us of rational intelli|gences, clearer manife&s;tations may belong to them. This may be one of the di&s;tinc|tions.

<P N="3">III. But thirdly; may it not al&s;o be a&s;ked, whether the perfect di&s;play of a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence would be compatible with the activity of civil life, and with the &s;ucce&s;s of human affairs? I can ea&s;ily conceive that this impre&s;&s;ion may be overdone; that it may &s;o &s;eize and fill the thoughts, as to
<PB N="373" REF="378">
leave no place for the cares and offices of men's &s;everal &s;tations, no anxiety for world|ly pro&s;perity, or even for a worldly provi|&s;ion, and, by con&s;equence, no &s;ufficient &s;ti|mulus to &s;ecular indu&s;try. Of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians we read, "that all that believed were together, and had all things common; and &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need; and, continuing daily with one ac|cord in the temple, and breaking bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, did eat their meat with glad|ne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 44&mdash;46.</NOTE>." This was extremely natural, and ju&s;t what might be expected, from miraculous evidence coming with full force upon the &s;en&s;es of mankind: but I much doubt, whether, if this &s;tate of mind had been univer&s;al, or long continued, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world could have gone on. The nece&s;&s;ary arts of &s;ocial life would have been little cultivated. The plough and the loom would have &s;tood &s;till. Agri|culture, manufactures, trade, and navigation,
<PB N="374" REF="379">
would not, I think, have flouri&s;hed, if they could have been exerci&s;ed at all. Men would have addicted them&s;elves to contem|plative and a&s;cetic lives, in&s;tead of lives of bu&s;ine&s;s and of u&s;eful indu&s;try. We ob|&s;erve that St. Paul found it nece&s;&s;ary, fre|quently to recall his converts to the ordi|nary labours and dome&s;tic duties of their condition; and to give them, in his own example, a le&s;&s;on of contented application to their worldly employments.</P>
<P>By the manner in which the religion is now propo&s;ed, a great portion of the hu|man &s;pecies is enabled, and of the&s;e, multi|tudes of every generation are induced, to &s;eek and to effectuate their &s;alvation through the medium of Chri&s;tianity, without inter|ruption of the pro&s;perity, or of the regular cour&s;e of human affairs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The &s;uppo&s;ed Effects of Chri&s;tianity.</HEAD>
<P>THAT a religion, which, under every form in which it is taught, holds forth the final reward of virtue, and puni&s;hment of vice, and propo&s;es tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of vir|tue and vice, which the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t cul|tivated part of mankind confe&s;s to be ju&s;t, &s;hould not be believed, is very po&s;&s;ible; but that, &s;o far as it is believed, it &s;hould not produce any good, but rather a bad effect upon public happine&s;s, is a propo&s;ition, which it requires very &s;trong evidence to render credible. Yet many have been found to contend for this paradox, and very confi|dent appeals have been made to hi&s;tory, and to ob&s;ervation, for the truth of it.</P>
<P>In the conclu&s;ions, however, which the&s;e writers draw, from what they call experience,
<PB N="376" REF="381">
two &s;ources, I think, of mi&s;take, may be perceived.</P>
<P>One is, that they look for the influence of religion in the wrong place:</P>
<P>The other, that they charge Chri&s;tianity with many con&s;equences, for which it is not re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P N="1">1. The influence of religion is not to be &s;ought for in the councils of princes, in the debates or re&s;olutions of popular a&s;&s;emblies, in the conduct of governments towards their &s;ubjects, or of &s;tates and &s;overeigns towards one another; of conquerors at the head of their armies, or of parties intriguing for power at home (topics, which alone almo&s;t occupy the attention, and fill the pages of hi&s;tory); but mu&s;t be perceived, if perceived at all, in the &s;ilent cour&s;e of private and do|me&s;tic life. Nay more; even <HI>there</HI> its in|fluence may not be very obvious to ob&s;er|vation. If it check, in &s;ome degree, per|&s;onal di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, if it beget a general probity
<PB N="377" REF="382">
in the tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s, if it pro|duce &s;oft and humane manners in the ma&s;s of the community, and occa&s;ional exertions of laborious or expen&s;ive benevolence in a few individuals, it is all the effect which can offer it&s;elf to external notice. The king|dom of Heaven is within us. That which is the &s;ub&s;tance of the religion, its hopes and con&s;olations, its intermixture with the thoughts by day and by night, the devotion of the heart, the control of appetite, the &s;tea|dy direction of the will to the commands of God, is nece&s;&s;arily invi&s;ible. Yet upon the&s;e depend the virtue and the happine&s;s of millions. This cau&s;e renders the repre&s;en|tations of hi&s;tory, with re&s;pect to religion, defective and fallacious, in a greater degree than they are upon any other &s;ubject. Re|ligion operates mo&s;t upon tho&s;e of whom hi&s;tory knows the lea&s;t; upon fathers and mothers in their families, upon men &s;ervants and maid &s;ervants, upon the orderly trade&s;|man, the quiet villager, the manufacturer at his loom, the hu&s;bandman in his fields. Among&s;t &s;uch its influence collectively may
<PB N="378" REF="383">
be of ine&s;timable value, yet its effects in the mean time little, upon tho&s;e who figure up|on the &s;tage of the world. <HI>They</HI> may know nothing of it; they may believe nothing of it; they may be actuated by motives more impetuous than tho&s;e which religion is able to excite. It cannot, therefore, be thought &s;trange, that this influence &s;hould elude the gra&s;p and touch of public hi&s;tory; for what is public hi&s;tory, but a regi&s;ter of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, the vices, the follies, and the quarrels, of tho&s;e who en|gage in contentions for power?</P>
<P>I will add, that much of this influence may be felt in times of public di&s;tre&s;s, and little of it in times of public wealth and &s;e|curity. This al&s;o increa&s;es the uncertainty of any opinions that we draw from hi&s;torical repre&s;entations. The influence of Chri&s;ti|anity is commen&s;urate with no effects which hi&s;tory &s;tates. We do not pretend, that it has any &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary and irre&s;i&s;tible power over the affairs of nations, as to &s;urmount the force of other cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="384">
The Chri&s;tian religion al&s;o acts upon pub|lic u&s;ages and in&s;titutions, by an operation which is only &s;econdary and indirect. Chri&s;|tianity is not a code of civil law. It can only reach public in&s;titutions through pri|vate character. Now its influence upon private character may be con&s;iderable, yet many public u&s;ages and in&s;titutions, repug|nant to its principles, may remain. To get rid of the&s;e, the reigning part of the com|munity mu&s;t act, and act together. But it may be long before the per&s;ons who com|po&s;e this body, be &s;ufficiently touched with the Chri&s;tian character, to join in the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of practices, to which they and the public have been reconciled, by cau&s;es which will reconcile the human mind to any thing, by habit and intere&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, the ef|fects of Chri&s;tianity, even in this view, have been important. It has mitigated the con|duct of war, and the treatment of captives. It has &s;oftened the admini&s;tration of de&s;po|tic, or of nominally de&s;potic governments. It has aboli&s;hed polygamy. It has re&s;train|ed the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of divorces. It has put
<PB N="380" REF="385">
an end to the expo&s;ure of children, and the immolation of &s;laves. It has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the combats of gladiators <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lip&s;ius affirms, (Sat. b. i. c. 12) that the gladiato|rial &s;hows &s;ometimes co&s;t Europe twenty or thirty thou&s;and lives in a month; and that not only the men, but even the women of all ranks, were pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the&s;e &s;hows. See Bi&s;hop Porteus's Sermon XIII.</NOTE>, and the impu|rities of religious rites. It has bani&s;hed, if not unnatural vices, at lea&s;t the toleration of them. It has greatly meliorated the con|dition of the laborious part, that is to &s;ay, of the ma&s;s of every community, by pro|curing for them a day of weekly re&s;t. In all countries, in which it is profe&s;&s;ed, it has produced numerous e&s;tabli&s;hments for the relief of &s;ickne&s;s and poverty; and, in &s;ome, a regular and general provi&s;ion by law. It has triumphed over the &s;lavery e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Roman empire: it is contending, and, I tru&s;t, will one day prevail, again&s;t the wor&s;e &s;lavery of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian writer <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Barde&s;anes ap. Eu&s;eb. Praep. Evang. vi. 10.</NOTE>, &s;o early as in the

&s;econd century, has te&s;tified the re&s;i&s;tance which Chri&s;tianity made to wicked and li|centious practices, though e&s;tabli&s;hed by law and by public u&s;age. "Neither in Parthia, do the Chri&s;tians, though Parthians, u&s;e po|lygamy; nor in Per&s;ia, though Per&s;ians, do they marry their own daughters; nor, among the Bactri or Galli, do they violate the &s;anc|tity of marriage; nor, wherever they are, do they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be overcome by ill-con&s;tituted laws and manners."</P>
<P>Socrates did not de&s;troy the idolatry of Athens, or produce the &s;lighte&s;t revolution in the manners of his country.</P>
<P>But the argument to which I recur is, that the benefit of religion being felt chiefly in the ob&s;curity of private &s;tations, nece&s;&s;a|rily e&s;capes the ob&s;ervation of hi&s;tory. From the fir&s;t general notification of Chri&s;tianity to the pre&s;ent day, there have been in every age many millions, who&s;e names were never heard of, made better by it, not only in their conduct, but in their di&s;po&s;ition; and happier,
<PB N="382" REF="387">
not &s;o much in their external circum|&s;tances, as in that which is <HI>inter praecordia,</HI> in that which alone de&s;erves the name of happine&s;s, the tranquillity and con&s;olation of their thoughts. It has been, &s;ince its commencement, the author of happine&s;s and virtue to millions and millions of the hu|man race. Who is there that would not wi&s;h his &s;on to be a Chri&s;tian?</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity al&s;o, in every country in which it is profe&s;&s;ed, hath obtained a &s;en&s;i|ble, although not a complete influence, up|on the public judgment of morals. And this is very important. For without the oc|ca&s;ional correction which public opinion re|ceives, by referring to &s;ome fixed &s;tandard of morality, no man can foretell into what extravagancies it might wander. A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion might become as honourable as duel|ling; unnatural crimes be accounted as venial, as fornication is wont to be account|ed. In this way it is po&s;&s;ible, that many may be kept in order by Chri&s;tianity, who are not them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. They may
<PB N="383" REF="388">
be guided by the rectitude which it com|municates to public opinion. Their con|&s;ciences may &s;ugge&s;t their duty truly, and they may a&s;cribe the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions to a mo|ral &s;en&s;e, or to the native capacity of the human intellect, when in fact they are no|thing more, than the public opinion reflect|ed from their own minds; an opinion, in a con&s;iderable degree, modified by the le&s;&s;ons of Chri&s;tianity. "Certain it is, and this is a great deal to &s;ay, that the generality, even of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t vulgar and igno|rant people, have truer and worthier notions of God, more ju&s;t and right apprehen&s;ions concerning his attributes and perfections, a deeper &s;en&s;e of the difference of good and evil, a greater regard to moral obligations and to the plain and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary duties of life, and a more firm and univer&s;al ex|pectation of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, than, in any heathen country, any con&s;iderable number of men were found to have had <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clark, Ev. Nat. Rev. p. 208, ed. v.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="389">
After all, the value of Chri&s;tianity is not to be appreciated by its <HI>temporal</HI> effects. The object of revelation, is to influence hu|man conduct in this life; but what is gained to happine&s;s by that influence, can only be e&s;timated by taking in the whole of human exi&s;teiice. Then, as hath already been ob|&s;erved, there may be al&s;o great con&s;equences of Chri&s;tianity, which do not belong to it as a revelation. The effects upon human &s;alvation, of the mi&s;&s;ion, of the death, of the pre&s;ent, of the future agency of Chri&s;t, may be univer&s;al, though the religion be not univer&s;ally known.</P>
<P>Secondly, I a&s;&s;ert that Chri&s;tianity is charged with many con&s;equences for which it is not re&s;pon&s;ible. I believe that religi|ous motives have had no more to do, in the formation of nine-tenths of the intolerant and per&s;ecuting laws, which in different countries have been e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the &s;ubject of religion, than they have had to do in England with the making of the game laws. The&s;e mea&s;ures, although they have
<PB N="385" REF="390">
the Chri&s;tian religion for their &s;ubject, are re&s;olvable into a principle which Chri&s;ti|anity certainly did not plant (and which Chri&s;tianity could not univer&s;ally condemn, becau&s;e it is not univer&s;ally wrong), which principle is no other than this, that they who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power do what they can to keep it. Chri&s;tianity is an&s;wer|able for no part of the mi&s;chief which has been brought upon the world by per&s;ecu|tion, except that which has ari&s;en from <HI>con|&s;cientious</HI> per&s;ecutors. Now the&s;e perhaps have never been, either numerous, or pow|erful. Nor is it to Chri&s;tianity that even <HI>their</HI> mi&s;take can fairly be imputed. They have been mi&s;led by an error, not properly Chri&s;tian or religious, but by an error in their moral philo&s;ophy. They pur&s;ued the particular, without adverting to the general con&s;equence. Believing certain articles of faith, or a certain mode of wor&s;hip, to be highly conducive, or perhaps e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, they thought them&s;elves bound to bring all they could, by every means, into them. And this they thought, without
<PB N="386" REF="391">
con&s;idering what would be the effect of &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, when adopted among&s;t mankind as a general rule of conduct. Had there been in the New Te&s;tament, what there are in the Koran, precepts authorizing coercion in the propagation of the religion, and the u&s;e of violence towards unbeliev|ers, the ca&s;e would have been different. This di&s;tinction could not have been taken, or this defence made.</P>
<P>I apologize for no &s;pecies nor degree of per&s;ecution, but I think that even the fact has been exaggerated. The &s;lave trade de|&s;troys more in a year, than the inqui&s;ition does in a hundred, or perhaps hath done &s;ince its foundation.</P>
<P>If it be objected, as I apprehend it will be, that Chri&s;tianity is chargeable with every mi&s;chief, of which it has been the <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> though not the motive; I an&s;wer, that, if the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions be there, the world will never want occa&s;ions. The noxious element will always &s;ind a conductor. Any

point will produce an explo&s;ion. Did the applauded intercommunity of the Pagan theology pre&s;erve the peace of the Roman world? Did it prevent oppre&s;&s;ions, pro|&s;criptions, ma&s;&s;acres, deva&s;tations? Was it bigotry that carried Alexander into the Ea&s;t, or brought Cae&s;ar into Gaul? Are the nations of the world, into which Chri&s;|tianity hath not found its way, or from which it hath been bani&s;hed, free from con|tentions? Are their contentions le&s;s ruinous and &s;anguinary? Is it owing to Chri&s;tianity, or to the want of it, that the fine&s;t regions of the Ea&s;t, the countries <HI>inter quatuor maria,</HI> the penin&s;ula of Greece, together with a great part of the Mediteranean coa&s;t, are at this day a de&s;art? or that the banks of the Nile, who&s;e con&s;tantly renewed fertility is not to be impaired by neglect, or de&s;troyed by the ravages of war, &s;erve only for the &s;cene of a ferocious anarchy, or the &s;upply of uncea&s;ing ho&s;tilities? Europe it&s;elf has known no religious wars for &s;ome centu|ries, yet has hardly ever been without war. Are the calamities, which at this day afflict

it, to be imputed to Chri&s;tianity? Hath Po|land fallen by a Chri&s;tian cru&s;ade? Hath the overthrow in France, of civil order and &s;ecurity, been effected by the votaries of our religion, or by the foes? Among&s;t the awful le&s;&s;ons, which the crimes and the mi|&s;eries of that country afford to mankind, this is one, that, in order to be a per&s;ecutor, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be a bigot: that in rage and cruelty, in mi&s;chief and de&s;truc|tion, fanatici&s;m it&s;elf can be outdone by in|fidelity.</P>
<P>Finally, if war, as it is now carried on between nations, produce le&s;s mi&s;ery and ruin than formerly, we are indebted per|haps to Chri&s;tianity for the change, more than to any other cau&s;e. Viewed therefore even in its relation to this &s;ubject, it appears to have been of advantage to the world. It hath humani&s;ed the conduct of wars; it hath cea&s;ed to excite them.</P>
<P>The differences of opinion, that have in all ages prevailed among&s;t Chri&s;tians, fall
<PB N="389" REF="394">
very much within the alternative which has been &s;tated. If we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the di&s;po&s;ition, which Chri&s;tianity labours, above all other qualities, to inculcate, the&s;e differences would do little harm. If that di&s;po&s;ition be want|ing, other cau&s;es, even were the&s;e ab&s;ent, would continually ri&s;e up, to call forth the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions into action. Differ|ences of opinion, when accompanied with mutual charity, which Chri&s;tianity forbids them to violate, are for the mo&s;t part inno|cent, and for &s;ome purpo&s;es u&s;eful. They promote enquiry, di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and knowledge. They help to keep up an attention to reli|gious &s;ubjects, and a concern about them, which might be apt to die away in the calm and &s;ilence of univer&s;al agreement. I do not know that it is in any degree true, that the influence of religion is the greate&s;t, where there are the fewe&s;t di&s;&s;enters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>IN religion, as in every other &s;ubject of human rea&s;oning, much depends upon the <HI>order</HI> in which we di&s;po&s;e our enquiries. A man who takes up a &s;y&s;tem of divinity with a previous opinion that either every part mu&s;t be true, or the whole fal&s;e, ap|proaches the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with great di&s;advan|tage. No other &s;y&s;tem, which is founded upon moral evidence, would bear to be treat|ed in the &s;ame manner. Neverthele&s;s, in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious &s;tudies under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakne&s;s of the human judgment in the early part of youth, yet its extreme &s;u&s;ceptibility of im|pre&s;&s;ion, renders it nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h it with &s;ome opinions, and with &s;ome princi|ples, or other. Or indeed, without much
<PB N="391" REF="396">
expre&s;s care, or much endeavour for this purpo&s;e, the tendency of the mind of man, to a&s;&s;imilate it&s;elf to the habits of thinking and &s;peaking which prevail around him, pro|duces the &s;ame effect. That indifferency and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, that waiting and equilibrium of the judgment, which &s;ome require in re|ligious matters, and which &s;ome would wi&s;h to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impo&s;&s;ible to be pre&s;erved. They are not given to the condition of human life.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;equence of this &s;ituation that the doctrines of religion come to us before the proofs; and come to us with that mix|ture of explications and inferences from which no public creed is, or can be, free. And the effect which too frequently follows, from Chri&s;tianity being pre&s;ented to the un|der&s;tanding in this form, is, that when any articles, which appear as parts of it, contra|dict the apprehen&s;ion of the per&s;ons to whom it is propo&s;ed, men of ra&s;h and con|fident tempers ha&s;tily and indi&s;criminately reject the whole. But is this to do ju&s;tice,
<PB N="392" REF="397">
either to them&s;elves, or to the religion? The rational way of treating a &s;ubject of &s;uch acknowledged importance is to attend, in the fir&s;t place, to the general and &s;ub&s;tan|tial truth of its principles, and to that alone. When we once feel a foundation; when we once perceive a ground of credibility in its hi&s;tory, we &s;hall proceed with &s;afety to en|quire into the interpretation of its records, and into the doctrines which have been de|duced from them. Nor will it either endan|ger our faith, or dimini&s;h or alter our mo|tives for obedience, if we &s;hould di&s;cover that the&s;e conclu&s;ions are formed with very diffe|rent degrees of probability, and po&s;&s;e&s;s very different degrees of importance.</P>
<P>This conduct of the under&s;tanding, dictat|ed by every rule of right rea&s;oning, will up|hold per&s;onal Chri&s;tianity, even in tho&s;e countries in which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed under forms, the mo&s;t liable to difficulty and objec|tion. It will al&s;o have the further effect of guarding us again&s;t the prejudices which are wont to ari&s;e in our minds to the di&s;advantage
<PB N="393" REF="398">
of religion, from ob&s;erving the nume|rous controver&s;ies which are carried on among&s;t its profe&s;&s;ors; and likewi&s;e of indu|cing a &s;pirit of lenity and moderation in our judgment, as well as in our treatment, of tho&s;e who &s;tand, in &s;uch controver&s;ies, upon &s;ides oppo&s;ite to ours. What is clear in Chri&s;tianity we &s;hall find to be &s;ufficient, and to be infinitely valuable; what is dubious, unnece&s;&s;ary to be decided, or of very &s;ubor|dinate importance; and what is mo&s;t ob|&s;cure, will teach us to bear with the opinions which others may have formed upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. We &s;hall &s;ay to tho&s;e who the mo&s;t widely di&s;&s;ent from us, what Au|gu&s;tine &s;aid to the wor&s;t heretics of his age; "Illi in vos &s;aeviant, qui ne&s;ciunt, cum quo labore verum inveniatur, et quam difficile caveantur errores&mdash;qui ne&s;ciunt, cum quant&acirc; difficultate &s;anetur oculus interioris hominis&mdash;qui ne&s;ciunt, quibus &s;u&s;piriis et gemitibus fiat, ut ex quantulacunque parte po&s;&s;it intelligi Deus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aug. contr. Ep. Fund. cap. ii. n. 2, 3.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="399">
A judgment, moreover, which is once pretty well &s;atisfied of the general truth of the religion, will not only thus di&s;criminate in its doctrines, but will po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient &s;trength to overcome the reluctance of the imagination to admit articles of faith which are attended with difficulty of apprehen&s;ion, if &s;uch articles of faith appear to be truly parts of the revelation. It was to be expect|ed beforehand, that what related to the oeco|nomy, and to the per&s;ons, of the invi&s;ible world, which revelation profe&s;&s;es to do, and which, if true, it actually does, &s;hould con|tain &s;ome points remote from our analogies, and from the comprehen&s;ion of a mind which hath acquired all its ideas from &s;en&s;e and from experience.</P>
<P>It hath been my care, in the preceding work, to pre&s;erve the &s;eparation between evidences and doctrines as inviolable as I could; to remove from the primary que&s;|tion all con&s;iderations which have been unnece&s;&s;arily joined with it: and to offer a defence of Chri&s;tianity, which every Chri&s;tian
<PB N="395" REF="400">
might read, without &s;eeing the tenets in which he had been brought up attacked or decried: and it always afforded a &s;atisfaction to my mind to ob&s;erve that this was practi|cable; that few or none of our many con|trover&s;ies with one another affect or relate to the proofs of our religion; that the rent never de&s;cends to the foundation.</P>
<P>The truth of Chri&s;tianity depends upon its leading facts, and upon them alone. Now of the&s;e we have evidence which ought to &s;atisfy us, at lea&s;t until it appear that man|kind have ever been deceived by the &s;ame. We have &s;ome unconte&s;ted and inconte&s;ti|ble points, to which the hi&s;tory of the human &s;pecies hath nothing &s;imilar to offer. A Jewi&s;h pea&s;ant changed the religion of the world, and that, without force, without power, without &s;upport; without one natural &s;ource or circum&s;tance of attraction, influ|ence, or &s;ucce&s;s. Such a thing hath not happened in any other in&s;tance. The com|panions of this per&s;on, after he him&s;elf had been put to death for his attempt, a&s;&s;erted
<PB N="396" REF="401">
his &s;upernatural character, founded upon his &s;upernatural operations; and, in te&s;timony of the truth of their a&s;&s;ertions, <HI>i. e.</HI> in con&s;e|quence of their own belief of that truth, and in order to communicate the knowledge of it to others, voluntarily entered upon lives of toil and hard&s;hip, and, with a full expe|rience of their danger, committed them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremities of per&s;ecution. This hath not a parallel. More particularly, a very few days after this per&s;on had been publicly executed, and in the very city in which he was buried, the&s;e his companions declared with one voice that his body was re&s;tored to life; that they had &s;een him, handled him, eat with him, conver&s;ed with him; and, in pur&s;uance of their per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of what they told, preached his religion, with this &s;trange fact as the foundation of it, in the face of tho&s;e who had killed him, who were armed with the power of the country, and nece&s;&s;arily and naturally di&s;po&s;ed to treat his followers as they had treated him&s;elf; and having done this upon the &s;pot where the event took
<PB N="397" REF="402">
place, carried the intelligence of it abroad, in de&s;pite of difficulties and oppo&s;ition, and where the nature of their errand gave them nothing to expect but deri&s;ion, in&s;ult, and outrage. This is without example. The&s;e three facts, I think, are certain, and would have been nearly &s;o, if the Go&s;pels had never been written. The Chri&s;tian &s;tory, as to the&s;e points, hath never varied. No other hath been &s;et up again&s;t it. Every letter, every di&s;cour&s;e, every controver&s;y, among&s;t the followers of the religion; every book written by them, from the age of its com|mencement to the pre&s;ent time, in every part of the world in which it hath been profe&s;&s;ed, and with every &s;ect into which it hath been divided (and we have letters and di&s;cour&s;es written by contemporaries, by witne&s;&s;es of the tran&s;action, by per&s;ons them&s;elves bear|ing a &s;hare in it, and other writings follow|ing that age in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion), <HI>concur</HI> in repre&s;enting the&s;e facts in this manner. A religion, which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the greate&s;t part of the civili&s;ed world, unque&s;tionably &s;prang up at Jeru&s;alem at this time. Some account
<PB N="398" REF="403">
mu&s;t be given of its origin; &s;ome cau&s;e a&s;|&s;igned for its ri&s;e. All the accounts of this origin, all the explications of this cau&s;e, whether taken from the writings of the early followers of the religion (in which, and in which perhaps alone, it could be expected that they &s;hould be di&s;tinctly unfolded) or from occa&s;ional notices in other writings of that or the adjoining age, either expre&s;sly alledge the facts above &s;tated as the means by which the religion was &s;et up, or advert to its commencement in a manner which agrees with the &s;uppo&s;ition of the&s;e facts being true, and which te&s;tifies their operation and effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions alone lay a foundation for our faith; for they prove the exi&s;tence of a tran&s;action, which cannot even in its mo&s;t <HI>general</HI> parts be accounted for, upon any rea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition, except that of the truth of the mi&s;&s;ion. But the particulars, the <HI>detail</HI> of the miracles or miraculous pre|tences (for &s;uch there nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t have been) upon which this unexampled tran&s;action
<PB N="399" REF="404">
re&s;ted, and <HI>for</HI> which the&s;e men acted and &s;uffered as they did act and &s;uffer, it is undoubtedly of great importance to us to know. We <HI>have</HI> this detail from the foun|tain head, from the per&s;ons them&s;elves; in accounts written by eye-witne&s;&s;es of the &s;cene, by contemporaries and companions of tho&s;e who were &s;o; not in one book, but four, each containing enough for the verifi|cation of the religion, all agreeing in the fundamental parts of the hi&s;tory. We have the authenticity of the&s;e books e&s;tabli&s;hed by more and &s;tronger proofs than belong to almo&s;t any other ancient book whatever, and by proofs which widely di&s;tingui&s;h them from any others claiming a &s;imilar au|thority to theirs. If there were any good rea&s;on for doubt concerning the names to which the&s;e books are a&s;cribed (which there is not, for they were never a&s;cribed to any other, and we have evidence not long after their publication of their bearing the names which they now bear), their antiquity, of which there is no que&s;tion, their reputation and authority among&s;t the early di&s;ciples of
<PB N="400" REF="405">
the religion, of which there is as little, form a valid proof that they mu&s;t, in the main at lea&s;t, have agreed with what the fir&s;t teachers of the religion delivered.</P>
<P>When we open the&s;e ancient volumes, we di&s;cover in them marks of truth, whether we con&s;ider each in it&s;elf, or collate them with one another. The writers certainly knew &s;omething of what they were writing about, for they manife&s;t an acquaintance with local circum&s;tances, with the hi&s;tory and u&s;ages of the times, which could only belong to an inhabitant of that country, living in that age. In every narrative we perceive &s;implicity and unde&s;ignedne&s;s; the air and the language of reality. When we compare the different narratives together, we find them &s;o varying as to repel all &s;u&s;picion of confederacy; &s;o agreeing under this variety, as to &s;hew that the accounts had one real tran&s;action for their common foundation; often attributing different actions and di&s;cour&s;es, to the per|&s;on who&s;e hi&s;tory, or rather memoirs of who&s;e hi&s;tory, they profe&s;s to relate, yet
<PB N="401" REF="406">
actions and di&s;cour&s;es &s;o &s;imilar, as very much to be&s;peak the &s;ame character; which is a coincidence, that, in &s;uch writers as they were, could only be the con&s;equence of their writing from fact, and not from imagination.</P>
<P>The&s;e four narratives are confined to the hi&s;tory of the founder of the religion, and end with <HI>his</HI> mini&s;try. Since however it is certain that the affair went on, we cannot help being anxious to know <HI>how</HI> it pro|ceeded. This intelligence hath come down to us in a work purporting to be written by a per&s;on, him&s;elf connected with the bu&s;i|ne&s;s during the fir&s;t &s;tages of its progre&s;s, taking up the &s;tory where the former hi&s;to|ries had left it, carrying on the narrative, oftentimes with great particularity, and throughout with the appearance of good &s;en&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Peter's &s;peech upon curing the cripple (Acts iii. 18.), the council of the apo&s;tles (xv.), Paul's di&s;cour&s;e at Athens (xvii. 22.), before Agrippa (xxvi.).

all along the origin, and the only probable origin, of effects which unque&s;tionably were produced, together with the natural con&s;e|quences of &s;ituations which unque&s;tionably did exi&s;t; and <HI>confirmed,</HI> in the &s;ub&s;tance at lea&s;t of the account, by the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible acce&s;&s;ion of te&s;timony which a hi&s;tory can receive, <HI>original letters,</HI> written by the per|&s;on who is the principal &s;ubject of the hi&s;|tory, written upon the bu&s;ine&s;s to which the hi&s;tory relates, and during the period, or &s;oon after the period, which the hi&s;tory compri&s;es. No man can &s;ay that this alto|gether is not a body of &s;trong hi&s;torical evidence.</P>
<P>When we reflect that &s;ome of tho&s;e, from whom the books proceeded, are related to have them&s;elves wrought miracles, to have been the &s;ubject of miracles, or of &s;uperna|tural a&s;&s;i&s;tance in propagating the religion, we may perhaps be led to think, that more credit, or a different kind of credit, is due to the&s;e accounts, than what can be claimed by merely human te&s;timony. But this is an
<PB N="403" REF="408">
argument which cannot be addre&s;&s;ed to &s;ceptics or unbelievers. A man mu&s;t be a Chri&s;tian before he can receive it. The in|&s;piration of the hi&s;torical &s;criptures, the na|ture, degree, and extent of that in&s;piration, are que&s;tions undoubtedly of &s;erious di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, but they are que&s;tions among&s;t Chri&s;|tians them&s;elves, and not between them and others. The doctrine it&s;elf is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to the belief of Chri&s;tianity, which mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance at lea&s;t, depend upon the ordinary maxims of hi&s;torical cre|dibility <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Powell's Di&s;cour&s;es. Di&s;c. xv. p. 245.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In viewing the detail of miracles recorded in the&s;e books, we find every &s;uppo&s;ition negatived, by which they can be re&s;olved into fraud or delu&s;ion. They were not &s;e|cret, nor momentary, nor tentative, nor ambiguous; nor performed under the &s;anc|tion of authority, with the &s;pectators on their &s;ide, or in affirmance of tenets and practices already e&s;tabli&s;hed. We find al&s;o
<PB N="404" REF="409">
the evidence alledged for them, and which evidence was by great numbers received, different from that upon which other mira|culous accounts re&s;t. It was contemporary, it was publi&s;hed upon the &s;pot, it continued; it involved intere&s;ts and que&s;tions of the greate&s;t magnitude; it contradicted the mo&s;t fixed per&s;ua&s;ions and prejudices of the per|&s;ons to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed; it required from tho&s;e who accepted it, not a &s;imple indolent a&s;&s;ent, but a change, from thence|forward, of principles and conduct, a fub|mi&s;&s;ion to con&s;equences the mo&s;t &s;erious and the mo&s;t deterring, to lo&s;s and danger, to in&s;ult, outrage, and per&s;ecution. How &s;uch a &s;tory &s;hould be fal&s;e, or, if fal&s;e, how un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances it &s;hould make its way, I think impo&s;&s;ible to be explained: yet &s;uch the Chri&s;tian &s;tory was, &s;uch were the circum&s;tances under which it came forth, and in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch difficulties did it prevail.</P>
<P>An event &s;o connected with the religion, and with the fortunes, of the Jewi&s;h people,
<PB N="405" REF="410">
as one of their race, one born among&s;t them, e&s;tabli&s;hing his authority and his law throughout a great portion of the civilized world, it was perhaps to be expected, &s;hould be noticed in the prophetic writings of that nation; e&s;pecially when this per&s;on, together with his own mi&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed al&s;o to be ac|knowledged, the divine original of their in|&s;titution, and by tho&s;e who before had al|together rejected it. Accordingly we per|ceive in the&s;e writings, various intimations <HI>concurring</HI> in the per&s;on and hi&s;tory of Je&s;us, in a manner, and in a degree, in which pa&s;&s;ages taken from the&s;e books could not be made to concur, in any per&s;on arbitrarily a&s;&s;umed, or in any per&s;on, except him, who has been the author of great changes in the affairs and opinions of mankind. Of &s;ome of the&s;e predictions the weight depends a good deal upon the concurrence. Others po&s;&s;e&s;s great &s;eparate &s;trength: one in parti|cular does this in an eminent degree. It is an entire de&s;cription, manife&s;tly directed to one character and to one &s;cene of things: it is extant in a writing, or collection of
<PB N="406" REF="411">
writings, declaredly prophetic; and it applies to Chri&s;t's character, and to the circum|&s;tances of his life and death, with con&s;ider|able preci&s;ion, and in a way which no di|ver&s;ity of interpretation hath, in my opi|nion, been able to confound. That the ad|vent of Chri&s;t, and the con&s;equences of it, &s;hould not have been more di&s;tinctly reveal|ed in the Jewi&s;h &s;acred books, is, I think, in &s;ome mea&s;ure accounted for by the con&s;ide|ration, that for the Jews to have fore&s;een the fall of their in&s;titution, and that it was to merge at length into a more perfect and comprehen&s;ive di&s;pen&s;ation, would have cooled too much, and relaxed, their zeal for it, and their adherence to it, upon which zeal and adherence the pre&s;ervation in the world of any remains, for many ages, of religious truth, might in a great mea&s;ure depend.</P>
<P>Of what a revelation di&s;clo&s;es to man|kind, one, and only one, que&s;tion can pro|perly be a&s;ked, "Was it of importance to mankind to know, or to be better a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="407" REF="412">
of?" In this que&s;tion, when we turn our thoughts to the great Chri&s;tian doctrine of the re&s;urrection of the dead, and of a future judgment, no doubt can po&s;&s;ibly be enter|tained. He who gives me riches or ho|nours does nothing; he who even gives me health does little, in compari&s;on with that which lays before me ju&s;t grounds for ex|pecting a re&s;toration to life, and a day of account and retribution: which thing Chri&s;|tianity hath done for millions.</P>
<P>Other articles of the Chri&s;tian faith, al|though of infinite importance when placed be&s;ide any other topic of human enquiry, are only the adjuncts and circum&s;tances of this. They are however &s;uch as appear worthy of the original to which we a&s;cribe them. The morality of the religion, whe|ther taken from the precepts or the example of its founder, or from the le&s;&s;ons of its primitive teachers, derived, as it &s;hould &s;eem, from what had been inculcated by their ma&s;ter, is, in all its parts, wi&s;e and pure; neither adapted to vulgar prejudices,
<PB N="408" REF="413">
nor flattering popular notions, nor excu&s;ing e&s;tabli&s;hed practices, but calculated, in the matter of its in&s;truction, truly to promote human happine&s;s, and, in the form in which it was conveyed, to produce impre&s;&s;ion and effect; a morality which, let it have pro|ceeded from any per&s;on whatever, would have been &s;atisfactory evidence of his good &s;en&s;e and integrity, of the &s;oundne&s;s of his under&s;tanding and the probity of his de|&s;igns; a morality, in every view of it, much more perfect than could have been expect|ed from the natural circum&s;tances and cha|racter of the per&s;on who delivered it; a mo|rality, in a word, which is, and hath been, mo&s;t beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P>Upon the greate&s;t therefore of all po&s;&s;ible occa&s;ions, and for a purpo&s;e of ine&s;timable value, it plea&s;ed the Deity to vouch&s;afe a miraculous atte&s;tation. Having done this for the in&s;titution, when this alone could fix its authority, or give to it a beginning, he committed its future progre&s;s to the natural means of human communication, and to the
<PB N="409" REF="414">
influence of tho&s;e cau&s;es by which human conduct and human affairs are governed. The &s;eed being &s;own, was left to vegetate; the leaven being in&s;erted, was left to fer|ment; and both according to the laws of nature: laws, neverthele&s;s, di&s;po&s;ed and controlled by that Providence which con|ducts the affairs of the univer&s;e, though by an influence in&s;crutable, and generally un|di&s;tingui&s;hable by us. And in this, Chri&s;|tianity is analogous to mo&s;t other provi&s;ions for happine&s;s. The provi&s;ion is made; and being made, is left to act according to laws, which, forming part of a more general &s;y&s;|tem, regulate this particular &s;ubject, in com|mon with many others.</P>
<P>LET the con&s;tant recurrence to our ob&s;er|vation, of contrivance, de&s;ign, and wi&s;dom in the works of nature, once fix upon our minds the belief of a God, and after that all is ea&s;y. In the councils of a Being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power and di&s;po&s;ition which the Creator of the univer&s;e mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, it is not improbable that there &s;hould be a
<PB N="410" REF="415">
future &s;tate; it is not improbable that we &s;hould be acquainted with it. A future &s;tate rectifies every thing; becau&s;e if moral agents be made, in the la&s;t event, happy or mi&s;erable, according to their conduct in the &s;tation, and under the circum&s;tances in which they are placed, it &s;eems not very material by the operation of what cau&s;es, according to what rules, or even, if you plea&s;e to call it &s;o, by what chance or ca|price, the&s;e &s;tations are a&s;&s;igned, or the&s;e circum&s;tances determined. This hypothe&s;is, therefore, &s;olves all that objection to the divine care and goodne&s;s, which the promi&s;|cuous di&s;tribution of good and evil (I do not mean in the doubtful advantages of riches and grandeur, but in the unque&s;tion|ably important di&s;tinctions of health and &s;ickne&s;s, &s;trength and infirmity, bodily ea&s;e and pain, mental alacrity and depre&s;&s;ion) is apt on &s;o many occa&s;ions to create. This one truth changes the nature of things: gives order to confu&s;ion: makes the moral world of a piece with the natural.</P>

Neverthele&s;s, a higher degree of a&s;&s;ur|ance than that to which it is po&s;&s;ible to ad|vance this, or any argument drawn from the light of nature, was nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially to overcome the &s;hock, which the imagina|tion and the &s;en&s;es receive, from the effects and the appearances of death; and the ob|&s;truction which from thence ari&s;es to the expectation of either a continued or a fu|ture exi&s;tence. This difficulty, although of a nature, no doubt, to act very forcibly, will be found, I think, upon reflection, to re&s;ide more in our habits of apprehen&s;ion, than in the &s;ubject; and that the giving way to it, when we have any rea&s;onable grounds for the contrary, is rather an indulging of the imagination, than any thing el&s;e. Ab&s;tract|edly con&s;idered, that is, con&s;idered without relation to the difference, which habit, and merely habit, produces in our faculties and modes of apprehen&s;ion, I do not &s;ee any thing more in the re&s;urrection of a dead man, than in the conception of a child; ex|cept it be this, that the one comes into his world with a &s;y&s;tem of prior con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;&s;es

about him, which the other does not: and no per&s;on will &s;ay, that he knows enough of either &s;ubject to perceive, that this cir|cum&s;tance makes &s;uch a difference in the two ca&s;es, that the one &s;hould be ea&s;y, and the other impo&s;&s;ible; the one natural, the other not &s;o. To the fir&s;t man the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of the &s;pecies would be as incompre|hen&s;ible, as the re&s;urrection of the dead is to us.</P>
<P>Thought is different from motion, per|ception from impact: the individuality of a mind is hardly con&s;i&s;tent with the divi&s;ibi|lity of an extended &s;ub&s;tance; or its voli|tion, that is, its power of originating mo|tion, with the inertne&s;s which cleaves to every portion of matter, which our ob&s;erva|tion or our experiments can reach. The&s;e di&s;tinctions lead us to an <HI>immaterial</HI> prin|ciple: at lea&s;t, they do this; they &s;o nega|tive the mechanical properties of matter, in the con&s;titution of a &s;entient, &s;till more of a rational being, that no argument, drawn from the&s;e properties, can be of any great
<PB N="413" REF="418">
weight in oppo&s;ition to other rea&s;ons, when the que&s;tion re&s;pects the changes of which &s;uch a nature is capable, or the manner in which the&s;e changes are effected. Whatever thought be, or whatever it depend upon, the regular experience of <HI>&s;leep</HI> makes one thing concerning it certain, that it can be completely &s;u&s;pended, and completely re|&s;tored.</P>
<P>If any one find it too great a &s;train upon his thoughts, to admit the notion of a &s;ub|&s;tance &s;trictly immaterial, that is, from which exten&s;ion and &s;olidity are excluded, he can find no difficulty in allowing, that a particle as &s;mall as a particle of light, minuter than all conceiveable dimen&s;ions, may ju&s;t as ea&s;ily be the depo&s;itary, the organ, and the vehicle of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as the congeries of animal &s;ub&s;tance, which forms a human body, or the human brain; that, being &s;o, it may transfer a proper identity to whatever &s;hall hereafter be united to it; may be &s;afe amid&s;t the de&s;truction of its integuments; may connect the natural with the &s;piritual,
<PB N="414" REF="419">
the corruptible with the glorified body. If it be &s;aid, that the mode and means of all this is imperceptible by our &s;en&s;es, it is only what is true of the mo&s;t important agencies and operations. The great powers of na|ture are all invi&s;ible. Gravitation, electri|city, magneti&s;m, though con&s;tantly pre&s;ent, and con&s;tantly exerting their influence; though within us, near us, and about us; though diffu&s;ed throughout all &s;pace, over|&s;preading the &s;urface, or penetrating the contexture of all bodies with which we are acquainted, depend upon &s;ub&s;tances and ac|tions, which are totally concealed from our &s;en&s;es. The Supreme Intelligence is &s;o him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But whether the&s;e, or any other attempts to &s;atisfy the imagination, bear any re&s;em|blance to the truth, or whether the imagi|nation, which, as I have &s;aid before, is the mere &s;lave of habit, <HI>can</HI> be &s;atisfied, or not; when a future &s;tate, and the revelation of a future &s;tate, is not only perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the attributes of the Being who governs

the univer&s;e; but when it is more; when it alone removes the appearances of contra|riety, which attend the operations of his will towards creatures capable of comparative merit and demerit, of reward and puni&s;h|ment; when a &s;trong body of hi&s;torical evi|dence, confirmed by many internal tokens of truth and authenticity, gives us ju&s;t rea|&s;on to believe that &s;uch a revelation hath actually been made; we ought to &s;et our minds at re&s;t with the a&s;&s;urance, that, in the re&s;ources of creative wi&s;dom, expedients cannot be wanted to carry into effect what the Deity hath purpo&s;ed: that either a new and mighty influence will de&s;cend upon the human world, to re&s;u&s;citate extingui&s;hed con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; or that, amid&s;t the other wonderful contrivances with which the uni|ver&s;e abounds, and by &s;ome of which we &s;ee animal life, in many in&s;tances, a&s;&s;uming improved forms of exi&s;tence, acquiring new organs, new perceptions, and new &s;ources of enjoyment, provi&s;ion is al&s;o made, though by methods &s;ecret to us (as all the great proce&s;&s;es of nature are), for conducting the
