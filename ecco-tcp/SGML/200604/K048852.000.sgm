<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM lxxvi. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>Surely, the wrath of man &s;hall praise thee: the
remainder of wrath shalt thou re&s;train.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this P&s;alm &s;ome remarkable Victory
and Deliverance is celebrated, which the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation had obtained: A Delive|rance
in which the Hand of God vi&s;i|bly
appeared, re&s;cuing his People from immi|nent
Danger. Very probably it was written
in <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Reign, on Occa&s;ion of their
being delivered from the formidable Inva&s;ion
of <HI>Sennacherib</HI> and the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Army;
when the Angel of the Lord, in one Night,
di&s;comfited all their Ho&s;t, and &s;mote them
with &s;udden De&s;truction<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 King xix. 35.</NOTE>
. To this &s;ignal
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Interpo&s;ition of the Divine Arm, the&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
in the Context may be naturally ap|plied;
<HI>There brake, he the arrows of the bow,
the &s;hield, the &s;word, and the battle&mdash;the
&s;tout-hearted are &s;poiled: they have &s;lept their
&s;leep; and none of the men of might have
found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Ja|cob,
both the chariot and the hor&s;e are ca&s;t in|to
a dead sleep.</HI> In the Words of our Text,
we have the P&s;almi&s;t's religious and wi&s;e Re|flection
upon all the&s;e Events; upon the vio|lent
De&s;igns of their Enemies, and the I&s;&s;ue
to which Providence brought the&s;e De&s;igns;
<HI>Surely, the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee:
the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The wrath of man;</HI> that is, all the Rage,
and the impetuous Pa&s;&s;ion of wicked Men;
with the violent Effects of War, Per&s;ecution,
Oppre&s;&s;ion, and other Di&s;orders it produces
in the World. All the&s;e the P&s;almi&s;t tells us,
<HI>&s;hall prai&s;e God:</HI> Not indeed, by the Intenti|on
and De&s;ign, nor by the native Tendency,
of the <HI>wrath of man:</HI> But by the&s;e wi&s;e and
good Purpo&s;es, which the Providence of God
cau&s;es it to <HI>accompli&s;h;</HI> from this Poi&s;on <HI>ex|tracting</HI>
Health; and of Things, mo&s;t unwil|ling
and unapt in them&s;elves to yield him Glo|ry,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<HI>forming</HI> In&s;truments of Good. So that,
tho' the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI>
&s;peaks, <HI>worketh not,</HI> of it&s;elf, <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of
God (a),</HI> it is neverthele&s;s, <HI>forced</HI> and <HI>compelled</HI>
to mini&s;ter to his <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t adds,
<HI>the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train:</HI>
That is, GOD will give Way to the Wrath of
Man, and allow it Scope, <HI>&s;o far</HI> as it an&s;wers
his good Purpo&s;es, and works his Prai&s;e; the
re&s;t of it &s;hall be curb'd and bound up: When
it would attempt to go beyond its pre&s;crib'd
Limit, he &s;ays to it, as to the Waters of the
Sea, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, but no fur|ther;
and here &s;hall thy proud waves be &s;tay|ed</HI>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 20.</NOTE>. All this, the la&s;t I&s;&s;ue of Things &s;hall
fully verify and declare: When we &s;hall be
able more clearly to trace the divine Admini|&s;tration
through its &s;everal Steps, by &s;eeing the
Con&s;ummation of the whole. In &s;ome Ca&s;es,
it may be re&s;erved for this Period only, to
di&s;clo&s;e and unfold the my&s;terious Wi&s;dom of
Heaven. But in general, as much of the di|vine
Conduct and Wi&s;dom, is at pre&s;ent ma|nife&s;t,
as gives ju&s;t Ground for this Ob&s;ervati|on,
that the <HI>wrath of man prai&s;es God,</HI> now,
before the whole World.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job xxxviii. 11.</NOTE> This was the Me|ditation
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of the P&s;almi&s;t after Victory and Con|que&s;t.
As we, my Brethren, like him, have
lately &s;een the <HI>wrath of man</HI> raging around us,
in all its Violence; and in the mid&s;t of its
Fury have &s;een it re&s;train'd and check'd by
the powerful Hand of GOD; &s;uch a Medita|tion,
mu&s;t be acknowledged very &s;uitable and
becoming now: That by &s;erious Contempla|tion
of the Ways of Providence, we may
learn to view the&s;e Revolutions which befal
Mankind, with the devout Sentiments of our
P&s;almi&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>IN pro&s;ecuting this Subject,</HI> I &s;hall endea|vour
to illu&s;trate and confirm the Ob&s;ervation
in my Text; by &s;howing in what Manner the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to <HI>prai&s;e God.</HI> And
then I &s;hall lead your Thoughts to the Im|provement
we ought to make of &s;uch a Me|ditation.</P>
<P>THE different Ways, in which the <HI>wrath
of man</HI> turns out to the <HI>prai&s;e of God,</HI> are re|ducible
chiefly to the&s;e three. I. As it <HI>mani|fe&s;ts</HI> mo&s;t brightly the glorious <HI>Perfections</HI>
of GOD in the Government of the Univer&s;e.
II. As it <HI>illu&s;trates</HI> and <HI>improves</HI> the <HI>Virtues</HI> of good Men; and thus <HI>beautifies</HI> his Church
and People. And, III. As it is made the
<PB N="5" REF="7">
Means of <HI>working</HI> out their greater <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>
and <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> upon the whole.</P>
<P>I. I &s;ay, the <HI>wrath of man prai&s;es God,</HI> as it gives Occa&s;ion for the brighter and more
illu&s;trious <HI>Di&s;covery of his Perfections,</HI> in the
<HI>Government</HI> of the World.&mdash;The <HI>Beauty</HI> and
<HI>Order</HI> of the Univer&s;e is much heighten'd, by
its being &s;o complicated a Sy&s;tem: In which,
there are &s;uch a Variety of Springs to be ad|ju&s;ted;
and &s;o many different Movements
to be regulated and kept in Order: Inter|fering
Intere&s;ts and jarring Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>ballanc'd,</HI>
in &s;uch Manner, again&s;t one another; violent
and unruly Men kept under &s;uch a wi&s;e and
regular <HI>Controul;</HI> and the <HI>wrath of man</HI> made
&s;o to know its <HI>Place;</HI> that, how oppo&s;ite &s;o|ever
the &s;everal Motions &s;eem to be, yet they
<HI>concur</HI> and meet at la&s;t in one End. This
renders a Divine Hand <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trious:</HI> This opens a more wonderful Pro&s;pect of the
Divine Government, than if all its Subjects
were loyal, and willingly obedient; and makes
that Power and Wi&s;dom, which can render
&s;uch <HI>intractable</HI> Things &s;ub&s;ervient to the Ends
of Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s, appear &s;o much the
more worthy of everla&s;ting Admiration and
Prai&s;e. More particularly,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
1. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> redounds to the
Prai&s;e of GOD's <HI>almighty Power;</HI> as this is
di&s;play'd in his re&s;training and baffling at Plea&s;ure
all its Fury and Wickedne&s;s.&mdash;To reign
with &s;overeign Command, amid&s;t the mo&s;t
di&s;order'd and turbulent State of Things, is
the peculiar Glory of Omnipotence. Hence
we find GOD de&s;crib'd in Scripture <HI>&s;itting
on the flood, riding on the wings of the wind,
dwelling in the darkne&s;s and the tempe&s;t.</HI> As
<HI>he &s;tills the raging of the &s;eas, and the noi&s;e of
their waves,</HI> &s;o, <HI>he &s;tills the tumults of the
people.</HI> When the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men are mo&s;t
<HI>agitated</HI> and <HI>inflamed,</HI> and their violent De|&s;igns
ju&s;t ripe for bur&s;ting into Execution;
how oft by &s;ome unfore&s;een. Turn of Provi|dence,
hath he call'd upon Mankind to ob|&s;erve,
that there is one <HI>higher than the highe&s;t
on Earth,</HI> who can baffle all their Devices
with the Breath of his Mouth; and com|mand
the Earth <HI>to be &s;till before him?</HI> When
proud Fleets cover the Ocean, he blows with
his Wind, and they are &s;cattered. When
mighty Armies go forth to Battle, in all the
Glory of human Strength, with what <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>
does an omnipotent Arm &s;ometimes appear?
&mdash;As in the Ca&s;e of haughty <HI>Sennacherib,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and that boa&s;ted Tempe&s;t of Wrath he threat|ned
to pour upon all the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation:
<HI>I will put my hook,</HI> &s;ays GOD, <HI>in thy no&s;e, and
my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou came&s;t</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xix. 23.</NOTE>. In that
Night the de&s;troying Angel &s;mote the Ho&s;t:
And he departed, we are told, with <HI>&s;hame of
face to his own land. When the heathen rage,
and the people imagine a vain thing; when the
kings of the earth &s;et them&s;elves, and its rulers
take coun&s;el together; he that &s;itteth in the
heavens &s;hall laugh: the Lord &s;hall hold them
in deri&s;ion: then &s;hall he &s;peak to them in
wrath, and vex them in his &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. ii. 1, 2, 4, 5.</NOTE>.
Again,</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to prai&s;e the <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> as well as the Power of GOD; when
he makes the unruly Pa&s;&s;ions of bad Men,
<HI>work</HI> in a &s;ecret Way, towards Ends, by them
altogether unfore&s;een. This mo&s;t eminently
di&s;plays the un&s;earchable Depths of the Di|vine
Coun&s;el, when we &s;ee them render'd the
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of Providence, to forward De&s;igns
which they intended to de&s;troy.&mdash;Thus, how
&s;urpri&s;ing is it, in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> that
the Cruelty of his Brethren, the Lewdne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="10">
and Re&s;entment of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the Wrath
of <HI>Potiphar,</HI> &s;hould all <HI>con&s;pire</HI> to his Ad|vancement,
and prove the <HI>Steps,</HI> by which
this per&s;ecuted and friendle&s;s Man ro&s;e, till he
became the Saviour of all his Kindred? How
remarkably did the <HI>wrath of man</HI> prai&s;e GOD
in the ca&s;e of <HI>Daniel?</HI> The Malice of his E|nemies
had thrown him into the Den of Li|ons
for wor&s;hipping GOD; they pre&s;umed
his De&s;truction accompli&s;h'd; and them|&s;elves
completely delivered from &s;o formi|dable
a Rival; yet this very Event prov'd not
only the Occa&s;ion of <HI>Daniel's</HI> greater Honour,
and their utter Ruin, but of a Decree through
all the Kingdom of the <HI>Medes,</HI> that all Men
&s;hould wor&s;hip and fear before the GOD of
<HI>Daniel</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dan vi. 25.</NOTE>. Thus GOD <HI>&s;nareth the wicked
in the works of their hands</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;l. ix. 16.</NOTE>: And <HI>erects</HI>
his own Coun&s;el upon the Ruin of theirs.
The&s;e Things which, view'd apart, appear to
us <HI>Spots</HI> in the divine Admini&s;tration, when
con&s;idered in their <HI>Connection</HI> with all the Train
of &s;ucceeding Events, often add a great <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI>
and <HI>Beauty</HI> to it. Were our Views exten&s;ive
enough, we &s;hould di&s;cern it always to be thus.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
3. I might ob&s;erve further, that the <HI>wrath
of man</HI> prai&s;es the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of GOD; in all
the&s;e Purpo&s;es of general <HI>Benefit,</HI> both <HI>tem|poral</HI>
and <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> to which his Providence
renders it &s;ub&s;ervient. But the&s;e will fall
to be afterwards con&s;idered; I therefore pro|ceed
to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>4. THAT the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to
prai&s;e the Divine <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI>&mdash;In many Ca&s;es it
is &s;ufficient for this End, that GOD let loo&s;e
upon bad Men, for their own <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI>
the&s;e angry Pa&s;&s;ions, which make them the
Di&s;turbers of others. By giving them up to
the Workings of the&s;e, he opens a Source of
re&s;tle&s;s Pain within their Brea&s;ts; and delivers
them over to them&s;elves, to be their own
<HI>Tormentors.</HI> In thus <HI>connecting</HI> the Puni&s;h|ment
with the Crime, cau&s;ing their <HI>own
wickedne&s;s to reprove them, and their back|&s;lidings
to correct them,</HI> the Hand of Ju&s;tice
is plainly &s;een. And tho' the Sinner that
<HI>feels</HI> it, may affect to di&s;gui&s;e his Suffering,
yet every one knows that no Puni&s;hment is
more <HI>real,</HI> or more <HI>inten&s;e,</HI> than the <HI>inward
Mi&s;ery</HI> of a Mind, wrought and torn with
De&s;pite, Revenge, or wrathful Pa&s;&s;ion. In
&s;uch a Ca&s;e, we may under&s;tand that Say|ing
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of the P&s;almi&s;t to receive its Accompli&s;h|ment;
<HI>The wicked have drawn out their
&s;word, and bent their bow, to ca&s;t down the
poor and needy;&mdash;but the &s;word which they
have drawn &s;hall enter into their own heart</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;l. xxxvii. 14, 15.</NOTE>.
&mdash;The <HI>wrath of man</HI> prai&s;es al&s;o the Divine
Ju&s;tice, by being the <HI>In&s;trutment</HI> of puni&s;h|ing
<HI>other</HI> ambitious and violent Men. They
are let loo&s;e upon one another to fulfil the
Vengeance of Heaven. One corrupt Nation
is rai&s;ed up again&s;t another; that <HI>both</HI> may
&s;uffer for their Sins. And as there can be no
&s;oild nor la&s;ting Bond of Union among&s;t wicked
Men, (tho' they may be occa&s;ionally cement|ed
by Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Good) their con|tinually
interfering Views and Intere&s;ts, ren|der
them, in the ju&s;t <HI>Judgment</HI> of Provi|dence,
a Prey to mutual Jealou&s;y, Strife and
Fraud.&mdash;Finally, the Ju&s;tice of GOD is
prai&s;ed in the <HI>Vengeance,</HI> which, &s;ooner or
later, he executes again&s;t the Wrath and Vio|lence
of Sinners. They may go on for a
Time, and appear to pro&s;per: The Ju&s;tice of
Heaven may &s;eem to &s;lumber: but it is <HI>awake:</HI>
and only waits till the <HI>mea&s;ure of their iniquity
be full.</HI> How oft has the World been a|wakened
to the Ob&s;ervation of the awful Go|vernment
<PB N="11" REF="13">
of GOD, by the &s;udden Fall and
De&s;truction of Tyrants? GOD repre&s;ents him|&s;elf
in Scripture, as permitting Wickedne&s;s
&s;ometimes to ari&s;e to an over-grown Height,
on Purpo&s;e that its Ruin may be the <HI>greater,</HI> and the more <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing. For this cau&s;e</HI> he
tells that wicked Prince <HI>Pharaoh, he had rai&s;ed
him up,</HI> that is, allowed him to pro&s;per and
be exalted, <HI>that he might &s;hew in him his
power; and that his name might be declared
throughout all the earth</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Exod, ix. 16.</NOTE>. The Divine Ad|mini&s;tration
is glorified as well in the <HI>&s;trange
Puni&s;hment</HI> he hath decreed for the Workers
of Iniquity, as in the <HI>Reward</HI> he hath pre|pared
for the Righteous. This is <HI>the purpo&s;e
which the Lord hath purpo&s;ed upon all the
earth: and this is the hand that &s;tretched
forth over all the nations</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xiv, 26.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to <HI>prai&s;e
God,</HI> by giving Mankind <HI>deep Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> of that
infinite <HI>Power, Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> that governs
the World. Such Impre&s;&s;ions it is nece&s;&s;ary
for Mankind to have; and, in their pre&s;ent
imperfect State, they can only receive them
from &s;omething that is <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>&s;triking.</HI> The Commotions and Di&s;orders of the World,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
open a Field for <HI>&s;ignalizing</HI> the Divine Ad|mini&s;tration
more, than if all Things went on
in a <HI>quiet undi&s;turbed</HI> Tenor. The Waters
mu&s;t be &s;ometimes <HI>troubled,</HI> that we may <HI>at|tend</HI>
to that Hand which &s;tills their Raging:
and <HI>Clouds</HI> mu&s;t ari&s;e, that the heavenly
Light which di&s;pels them, may <HI>&s;trike</HI> our
Eye with the more &s;en&s;ible <HI>Brightne&s;s.</HI> We
further ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>II. THAT the <HI>wrath of man</HI> may be ju&s;tly
&s;aid to prai&s;e GOD, by that Tendency which
he gives it to <HI>improve</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trate</HI> the <HI>Virtues</HI>
of good Men; and thereby to <HI>beautify</HI> his
Church and People. Now it hath this Effect,</P>
<P>1. As it is employed by GOD to be the
Means of <HI>correcting</HI> good Men for their Faults.
The&s;e <HI>Storms,</HI> which Ambition and Pride rai&s;e
among Mankind, he permits, with the &s;ame
Intention, that he &s;ends forth <HI>Tempe&s;ts</HI> and
<HI>Hurricanes</HI> among&s;t the Elements; to clear
the Atmo&s;phere of noxious Vapours, and pu|rify
it from that <HI>Corruption</HI> which all Things
contract by too much Re&s;t. Bad Men appear
&s;ometimes to have obtained entire Power o|ver
the Ju&s;t: they exerci&s;e their Tyranny,
perhaps, with a very heavy and oppre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Hand: the Ju&s;t complain and groan; and in the
Bitterne&s;s of their Soul, can hardly for|bear
to exclaim; "<HI>Where</HI> is the Lord? And
where the <HI>Sceptre</HI> of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and
<HI>Truth? Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</HI>
Or doth he indeed <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and <HI>is there know|ledge
in the Mo&s;t High?</HI>"&mdash;Their Oppre&s;|&s;ors
are really no more than the In&s;truments
of GOD to them for <HI>Good:</HI> He &s;ees they &s;tand
in <HI>Need</HI> of &s;uch Correction; and therefore
rai&s;es them up Enemies, to cure the Intempe|rance
of Pro&s;perity; And by that Seriou&s;ne&s;s
which Affliction is fitted to introduce into the
Mind, to lead them to think of them&s;elves,
of their Duty, and their pa&s;t Errors. In this
Way the Di&s;turbers of the Earth are often re|pre&s;ented
to us in Scripture; as <HI>Scourges</HI> in the
Hand of GOD, &s;ent forth to do his Work up|on
a degenerating People: They are employed
in the Execution of righteous and wi&s;e Purpo|&s;es,
<HI>concealed</HI> from them&s;elves; and, when
their Commi&s;&s;ion is fulfilled, recalled and de|stroyed.
Of this we have a remarkable Ex|ample
in the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria. I will &s;end him,
&s;ays</HI> GOD, <HI>against an hypocritical nation, and
again&s;t the people of my wrath, will I give him
a charge, to take the &s;poil and to take the prey:
<PB N="14" REF="16">
&mdash;howbeit he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his

the Famine, the Pe&s;tilence, and the Flood:
their <HI>Triumphs</HI> are no more than the Ac|compli&s;hment
of GOD's Correction: And <HI>the
remainder of their wrath &s;hall he re&s;train.</HI></P>
<P>2. GOD makes the <HI>wrath of man</HI> to prai&s;e
him, not only by employing it in Cha&s;ti&s;e|ment,
but as the In&s;trument of <HI>improving</HI> and
<HI>&s;ignalizing</HI> the Graces of good Men; and
<PB N="15" REF="17">
thereby rai&s;ing them to higher <HI>Honour</HI> and
<HI>Glory.</HI>&mdash;Had there been no Per&s;ecutors and
Tyrants, no Oppre&s;&s;ors of Liberty, no wrath|ful
and furious Men in the World, what a
Number of <HI>great</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> Actions had ne|ver
been heard of? What &s;hining Examples
of Fortitude, Con&s;tancy and Patience, had
been lo&s;t to the World? What a Field of Vir|tues,
<HI>peculiar</HI> to a State of Improvement and
Di&s;cipline, had lain uncultivated?&mdash;Spirits
of a higher Order po&s;&s;e&s;s a State of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI>
Virtue, that &s;tands in Need of no &s;uch <HI>Improve|ments</HI>
and <HI>Trials.</HI> But to <HI>us,</HI> who are only
under Education for &s;uch a State, it <HI>belongs</HI> to
pa&s;s through the Furnace, that our Souls may
be <HI>tried, refined,</HI> and <HI>brightened.</HI> We mu&s;t
&s;tand the <HI>Conflict,</HI> that we may be graced and
crowned as <HI>Conquerors.</HI> The <HI>wrath of man</HI> gives
the Occa&s;ion, and the Field;&mdash;calls us forth
to the mo&s;t con&s;picuous and di&s;tingui&s;hed Ex|erci&s;e
of <HI>active</HI> Virtue,&mdash;and forms us to all
tho&s;e <HI>&s;uffering</HI> Graces which are among&s;t the
brighte&s;t Ornaments of the human Soul. When
unju&s;t Attempts are carried on again&s;t our pub|lick
Intere&s;ts, the&s;e give us the Means of di&s;co|vering
true publick Spirit, and Love to our Coun|try.
When we &s;uffer in our private Concerns,
<PB N="16" REF="18">
there our Enemies put it into our Power
to gain the noble&s;t Conque&s;t, by overcoming
the World; and to make our&s;elves greater than
the greate&s;t Man who injures us by forgiving
him. When we &s;uffer for the Sake of Truth
and a good Con&s;cience, there we have the de|&s;irable
Opportunity afforded us, of gaining Ho|nour
truly immortal, by being Witne&s;&s;es for
GOD, and maintaining an exemplary and he|roic
Fidelity. In all this <HI>the wrath of man
prai&s;es God.</HI>&mdash;Every &s;ingle In&s;tance, in which
our Souls are improv'd, or &s;ome Action of
di&s;tingui&s;hed Goodne&s;s is produced, by Means
of <HI>the wrath of man,</HI> redounds mo&s;t highly,
both to our <HI>own Good,</HI> and to <HI>his Prai&s;e,</HI> who
hath <HI>order'd</HI> Things in this Manner for our
<HI>Improvement.</HI>&mdash;'Tis thus, the illu&s;trious Band
of Patriots and Heroes, of Confe&s;&s;ors and Mar|tyrs,
have been &s;et forth to the Admiration of
all Ages, as <HI>the lights of the world:</HI> Whil&s;t the
Violence and Fury of Enemies, in&s;tead of
bearing them down, has only &s;erv'd to exalt
and dignify them the more.&mdash;We proceed
now to the</P>
<P>III. VIEW we propo&s;ed to give of the <HI>wrath
of man prai&s;ing God;</HI> when Providence makes
<PB N="17" REF="19">
it the Mean of <HI>working</HI> out greater <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>
and <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> upon the whole, to his People
and Church.&mdash;I &s;ay, the Violence of <HI>Enemies,</HI>
the Rage of <HI>Per&s;ecutors,</HI> and the Oppre&s;&s;ion
of <HI>Tyrants,</HI> not only tend, in the Way of mo|ral
and religious Improvement to the <HI>better|ing</HI>
of our Souls; but al&s;o are often made,
in their Con&s;equences, to produce other un|look'd
for Ble&s;&s;ings to good Men <HI>in this State.</HI>
As this is no rare nor unfrequent Thing, we
&s;hall point out &s;ome In&s;tances in which it ap|pears.
Thus,</P>
<P>THE Hard&s;hips which good Men &s;uffer
from others in their <HI>private</HI> Concerns, are of|ten
&s;een to <HI>give Birth</HI> to their &s;ucceeding Pro&s;|perity.
Many Exemplifications of this we
find in Hi&s;tory. The unfortunate Circum|&s;tances
of <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> Birth, thro' the Cruelty of
an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tyrant, were the Means of this
expo&s;ed Infant's being bred up as a King's Son,
and of his being <HI>accompli&s;h'd</HI> for his future
great Atchievements, with all the Wi&s;dom
and Learning of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Court. The
In&s;olence and proud Re&s;entment of <HI>Haman</HI>
pav'd the Way for the Advancement of <HI>Mor|decai</HI>
his Enemy, at the very critical Time
When he thought his De&s;igns ripe for &s;inking
<PB N="18" REF="20">
him into Ruin: And his cruel Scheme for
the De&s;truction of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s whole Nation,
prov'd the Occa&s;ion of their being rai&s;ed above
<HI>all</HI> their Enemies. <HI>There are many devices in
the heart of a man, but the coun&s;el of the Lord
&s;hall &s;tand</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix. 21.</NOTE>. He, <HI>connecting</HI> together each
Link in the Chain of Events that fill up our
Life, by an unexpected <HI>Contexture</HI> of Cau&s;es,
makes tho&s;e Things which we mo&s;t deplore
<HI>bring on</HI> our better Days: And, in the dark
Bo&s;om of Misfortune, gradually <HI>ripens</HI> the la|tent
Seeds of future Pro&s;perity.&mdash;How fre|quently
have the Attempts of Enemies to run
down and <HI>blacken</HI> good Men by all the Arts
of Malice, made their Character &s;hine the
<HI>fairer</HI> in the Eye of the impartial World?
How frequently have the <HI>Extremities</HI> to which
they have been driven by Inju&s;tice and Vio|lence,
prov'd the Occa&s;ion of calling forth
their <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Activity,</HI> and of putting
them upon &s;uch <HI>Efforts</HI> to do them&s;elves Ju|&s;tice,
as have rai&s;ed them higher than ever
they fell? How many, in the Cour&s;e of their
Life, have had Rea&s;on to be <HI>thankful</HI> for be|ing
di&s;appointed by the Wrath of their Ene|mies,
in De&s;igns, which, perhaps, they very
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<HI>earne&s;tly</HI> pur&s;ued; but which, if they had
<HI>&s;uccce&s;sfully</HI> accompli&s;h'd, they have afterwards
&s;een would have prov'd their <HI>Ruin? Who&s;o is
wi&s;e and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even he &s;hall
understand the loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cvii. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if thus, in <HI>private</HI> Life, the <HI>wrath of
man</HI> is often made to prai&s;e GOD, by becom|ing
the Occa&s;ion of greater Good; &s;till more
is the Hand of GOD apparent, in the Ends of
<HI>publick Benefit</HI> it is made to &s;erve, to <HI>Nations</HI>
and <HI>Societies.</HI>&mdash;The Rage of Civil Wars, the
Oppre&s;&s;ion of Tyrants, and all the other di&s;|mal
Effects of the Ambition and Wrath of
Man, have often &s;ung the Prai&s;e of GOD to
many &s;ucceeding Generations. Thence have
been made to &s;pring, publick <HI>Liberty</HI> to a
People, wi&s;e <HI>Government,</HI> good <HI>Order,</HI> and
la&s;ting <HI>Peace.</HI> Nations have been thereby a|waken'd
to &s;ee their <HI>true Intere&s;ts;</HI> and taught
more effectually to <HI>&s;ecure</HI> them. Publick Af|fairs
being once thrown into a <HI>Ferment,</HI> the
Corruptions of Government, like bad Hu|mours
in the Body, have been purg'd and
wrought off. The Feeling of grievous Op|pre&s;&s;ion
has frequently been the fir&s;t Thing
that made Nations <HI>&s;hake off</HI> the <HI>Yoke;</HI> and
<PB N="20" REF="22">
led them to a&s;&s;ert their own <HI>ju&s;t Rights</HI> again&s;t
tyrannical Governors; <HI>which,</HI> had their Ty|ranny
been le&s;s in&s;olent, the&s;e Nations would
have remain'd longer, perhaps for ever, <HI>de|priv'd
of.</HI> Of this we have a memorable Ex|ample
in the late glorious and happy <HI>Revolu|tion</HI>
in our own Country. Our Con&s;titution,
and its Liberties, might have been <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly
undermined,</HI> and <HI>ruined,</HI> had it not been for
the glaring and open Violation of Laws with
a high Hand; which proclaiming all to be <HI>then</HI>
at Stake, rouz'd up the Spirits of Men to
rnake a determin'd Stand again&s;t incroaching
<HI>Tyranny:</HI> and thus gave Birth to that <HI>free</HI>
and <HI>legal Establi&s;hment,</HI> with which we at
this Day are ble&s;&s;ed; and for which, we hope,
late Po&s;terity after us, &s;hall continue to ble&s;s
the Providence of GOD. Had it not been for
the <HI>avow'd</HI> Attempts then made again&s;t our
Religion. and our fundamental Rights <HI>Britain</HI>
might have been now under a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Sove|reign:
and, in&s;tead of that mild and tempe|rate
Admini&s;tration we have enjoyed, under a
Series of Princes who have always made the
Law their Rule, we would have been the
Subjects, or rather <HI>Slaves,</HI> of tho&s;e who arro|gantly
claim us as their <HI>Property</HI> by <HI>Divine
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Right.</HI> In like Manner, the Tyranny and
Violence of <HI>Tarquin,</HI> produced the illu&s;trious
and victorious Commonwealth of <HI>Rome.</HI> The
Oppre&s;&s;ion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> laid the
Foundation of the Liberty of the <HI>United Pro|vinces;</HI>
and Liberty, from a few incon&s;ide|rable
Fi&s;her-towns, has rai&s;ed them to the
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Height of Trade and Opu|lence.
&mdash;As to the fir&s;t <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of Free|dom,
&s;o to the further <HI>Security</HI> of a publick
Intere&s;t, unju&s;t and violent De&s;igns have been
often &s;ub&s;ervient. Attempts to <HI>overthrow</HI> a
good Government, have generally <HI>&s;trength|ned</HI>
it more. By the&s;e its fal&s;e Friends are
<HI>unmasked</HI> and brought to Light; its &s;ecret
Foes &s;uffer for their Treachery: the <HI>Zeal</HI> of
its Well-wi&s;hers is awakened and increa&s;ed;
and, from what is felt of the <HI>Violence</HI> and
<HI>Outrage</HI> of its Enemies, People are more con|firm'd
in <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of their De&s;igns, and
made more ju&s;tly to prize the Ble&s;&s;ings of
<HI>Tranquillity</HI> and <HI>legal Protection.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER, the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> in the <HI>Per|&s;ecution</HI>
of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> &s;ignally prai&s;es
GOD, when it is made to turn to the greater
<HI>Advancement</HI> of Religion, and further Propa|gation
of Truth.&mdash;The Church of GOD, &s;ince
<PB N="22" REF="24">
the Days of its Infancy, hath never been free
from the World's Wrath; and yet, in the&s;e
Ages in which it was mo&s;t <HI>per&s;ecuted,</HI> it hath
mo&s;t <HI>flouri&s;hed.</HI> In vain, the Policy and the
Rage of the World united their Strength, to
extingui&s;h this Divine Light. Tho' all the
four Winds blew again&s;t it, it only &s;hone the
brighter; and flam'd the higher: <HI>Many wa|ters
could not quench it, nor all the floods drown
it:</HI> and the Blood of the Martyrs, as has
been often and ju&s;tly &s;aid, was the Seed of
the Church. The <HI>Zeal</HI> of the primitive Chri|&s;tians,
their <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> and <HI>Fortitude</HI> in gi|ving
Te&s;timony to Truth, and their chearful
<HI>Patience</HI> in &s;uffering for it, did much more
to <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the Number of Converts to true
Religion, than all the <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Cruelty</HI> of
Per&s;ecutors could ever do to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> it. The At|tempts
that were u&s;ed to bear down Religion,
only enlarg'd its Triumphs, by di&s;playing the
victorious Force of Truth. By this Means
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> was made to turn <HI>again&s;t it|&s;elf,</HI>
to the De&s;truction of its own Purpo&s;e;&mdash;
like Waves, that, a&s;&s;aulting a Rock with im|potent
Fury, di&s;cover its immoveable Stabi|lity,
whil&s;t they da&s;h them&s;elves in Pieces at
its Feet. Pro&s;perity, Greatne&s;s, and worldly
<PB N="23" REF="25">
Favour may have corrupted Religion, and
&s;ullied the Purity of the Church: But, never
did the <HI>wrath of man</HI> try to overthrow it, but
in the I&s;&s;ue it made its own Weakne&s;s appear;
and rais'd the <HI>prai&s;e of God,</HI> by purifying the
Church, and advancing Religion more.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add one In&s;tance more of
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> prai&s;ing GOD, by accom|pli&s;hing
Ends of mo&s;t exten&s;ive Benefit: and
that is, <HI>the Death of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;Ne|ver
did Malice, Rage and Envy plea&s;e them|&s;elves
with the Thoughts of having obtain'd
a more complete Triumph, than in this Ca&s;e.
JESUS was now put to Death; the Revenge
of his Enemies gratified; his Name, and his
Honour, they believ'd, rooted out from a|mong&s;t
Men;&mdash;yet, behold how vain the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> is! all that they intended to
<HI>overthrow,</HI> they mo&s;t effectually <HI>confirm'd.</HI>
The <HI>Ignominy</HI> of the Cro&s;s became the
Standard of <HI>eternal Honour</HI> to CHRIST, and
his Religion: and his <HI>Death,</HI> perpetrated by
them as a wicked Murder, was, in the Coun|&s;el
of GOD, the Spring of <HI>everla&s;ting Life</HI> to
all his Followers. He, who <HI>re&s;trains the
Remainder of Wrath</HI> at his Plea&s;ure, &s;uffer'd
their Rage to &s;ugge&s;t no <HI>other</HI> Things to them,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
than what him&s;elf had long before determin'd,
and his Prophets foretold, &s;hould be &s;o done.
So that they all <HI>con&s;pir'd</HI> to render the whole
mo&s;t exactly conformable to his <HI>original Plan</HI>
of Mercy and Goodne&s;s; and each contri|buted
his <HI>Share,</HI> to fini&s;h that great Work,
which none of them <HI>knew</HI> any thing of, nor
in the lea&s;t <HI>intended.</HI>&mdash;So <HI>glorious</HI> an In&s;tance
as this, fully <HI>a&s;certain'd</HI> and laid out to us in
Scripture, of the <HI>wrath of man</HI> mini&s;tring to
the gracious De&s;igns of Heaven, ought to
have the greate&s;t Weight; as an <HI>Exemplifica|tion</HI>
of the Conduct of Providence in ma|ny
<HI>other Ca&s;es,</HI> where we have not &s;o much
Light afforded us for the Di&s;covery of its
Ways.</P>
<P>AND now, by this Induction of Particulars,
you &s;ee, upon the whole, how much Ground
there is for a&s;&s;erting, that the <HI>wrath of man
&s;hall prai&s;e God;</HI> that all the Di&s;orders
which the Pa&s;&s;ion and Pride of Men occa&s;ion
in the World, tho' they take their fir&s;t <HI>Ri&s;e</HI>
from the Corruption of human Nature, are &s;o
<HI>order'd,</HI> as to become Parts of a wi&s;e and
good Con&s;titution, redounding to his Honour
and Glory, who hath order'd all.&mdash;Either illu&s;trating
before the World, his <HI>Divine Per|fections,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="27">
in the Government of Things;&mdash;or
&s;erving the Purpo&s;es of <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>religious
Improvement</HI> to the Souls of Men;&mdash;or by
&s;ome &s;ecret Tendency, <HI>working out Pro&s;perity
and Happine&s;s</HI> to tho&s;e whom they &s;eem mo&s;t
to threaten with Suffering and Evil.&mdash;<HI>Surely,
O GOD, the wrath of man. &s;hall prai&s;e thee!
the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train!</HI>
"In thy Hand it is; and thou never lets it
forth but in <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ure.</HI> It is
<HI>wild</HI> and <HI>intractable</HI> in its Nature; but thou
<HI>tame&s;t</HI> it: <HI>blind</HI> and <HI>headlong</HI> in its Im|pul&s;e;
but thou <HI>directe&s;t</HI> it: ever <HI>&s;truggling</HI>
to break its Chain, knowing no Bounds; but
thou <HI>confine&s;t</HI> it: Thou <HI>retrenche&s;t</HI> all the
<HI>Superfluity of its Fury!"</HI>&mdash;Let us now
con&s;ider, what is the Improvement to be made
of this Meditation on the Ways of Providence.</P>
<P>1. Let it lead us to a religious Contempla|tion
of the <HI>Hand of God,</HI> in all the Occurren|ces
and Tran&s;actions of the World. We be|hold
a very mixed and bu&s;y Scene of Things
pa&s;&s;ing before us: the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men vari|ou&s;ly
agitated and new Changes daily brought
forth upon this Stage of Time. We behold
Peace and War taking their Turns: the
<PB N="26" REF="28">
Fortunes of private Men ri&s;ing and falling:
and Nations and Kingdoms partaking in the
&s;ame Fluctuation and Vici&s;&s;itude. In all this,
if we look no farther than to the Operation
of external Cau&s;es, and the mere Rotation of,
Events, we behold only the dead Side of Na|ture;
&mdash;&s;top at the Surface of Things;&mdash;
contemplate them not like rational and religi|ous
Beings. The <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> of the U|niver&s;e
ari&s;es from the View of that Wi&s;dom
and Goodne&s;s, which <HI>animates</HI> and <HI>conducts</HI>
the whole; and <HI>unites</HI> all the Parts in one
great De&s;ign. There is an eternal Mind that
puts all the&s;e Wheels in Motion; him&s;elf re|maining
for ever at Re&s;t. Of him we are to
conceive not as removed from this World;
&s;itting, a mere Spectator of his Creatures, in
his high Abode: but as an omnipre&s;ent Spi|rit,
<HI>pervading, directing,</HI> and <HI>regulating</HI> all;
ever bu&s;y without <HI>Toil,</HI> and working without
<HI>Wearine&s;s!</HI> Nothing is void of him: even in
the Pa&s;&s;ions and Ragings of Men, GOD is to
be found: and when they think they guide
them&s;elves, his Hand controuls and guides
them &s;till.&mdash;To what &s;erious and &s;olemn
Thoughts are we led by &s;uch a View as this;
when we attend not merely to the Actings of
<PB N="27" REF="29">
Men, but to the Ways of GOD; deeply im|pre&s;s'd
with the Belief, that we and all our
Concerns are Parts of his great Admini|&s;tration!</P>
<P>2. FROM what has been &s;aid we &s;ee, that
we ought not to be &s;haken in our Minds,
by any pre&s;ent <HI>&s;eeming Di&s;orders</HI> of the
World, &s;o as on Account of them to think ill
of Providence. Many Things, doubtle&s;s, there
are, which appear as <HI>Blemi&s;hes</HI> in the general
Order, to a &s;uperficial View; and which, if
we were to regulate the World, we think
&s;hould have <HI>no Place</HI> in it. And yet, the&s;e
various In&s;tances, which we <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and can clear|ly
<HI>trace,</HI> of the Workings of Pa&s;&s;ion and Wic|kedne&s;s,
render'd &s;ub&s;ervient to worthy and
good Ends, give us the highe&s;t Rea&s;on to con|clude,
that, in all other Ca&s;es of &s;eeming Evil,
the like Ends are promoted. This ought to &s;a|tisfy
our Minds, even where the Pro&s;pect is mo&s;t
<HI>di&s;couraging,</HI> and the State of human Affairs
mo&s;t <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>embroil'd.</HI> The Schemes of Di|vine
Wi&s;dom are too <HI>large</HI> and <HI>comprehen&s;ive,</HI>
to be di&s;cerned by us, in all their Extent, at
one View; and, where we &s;ee only by <HI>Parts,</HI>
we mu&s;t be often at a Lo&s;s to judge of the
<HI>Whole. The way of God is in the &s;ea, and
<PB N="28" REF="30">
his path in the great waters: his foot&s;teps are
not known<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxvii. 19.</NOTE>. Although thou &s;aye&s;t thou
can&s;t not &s;ee him, yet judgment is &s;till before
him, therefore tru&s;t thou in him</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE>. His it
is, to educe Good from Ill, Order from Con|fui&s;ion,
his own ju&s;t Prai&s;e from Man's Wrath.
As in the natural World, there is no <HI>real</HI> De|formity;
nothing but what has either its own
Ornament or U&s;e: &s;o, the mo&s;t irregular and
deformed <HI>Appearances</HI> in the moral World,
&s;hall be made to <HI>heighten</HI> the Beauty of the
whole: And, in the End, <HI>all</HI> the Works of
GOD &s;hall appear to be perfect. GOD <HI>binds</HI>
together the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite and di&s;agreeing
Principles in the Laws of univer&s;al <HI>Concord:</HI>
and <HI>adapts,</HI> even the mo&s;t har&s;h and di&s;cor|dant
Notes, to the <HI>Harmony</HI> of his Goodne&s;s.
As he hath rear'd the goodly Frame of Na|ture,
from <HI>various</HI> and <HI>jarring</HI> Elements, and
hath &s;ettled it in Peace; &s;o he hath formed
&s;uch an <HI>Union,</HI> by his Providence, of the <HI>more
various</HI> Intere&s;ts, and <HI>more jarring</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions of
Men, that they all <HI>con&s;pire</HI> to his Glory, and
<HI>co-operate</HI> for the general Good.&mdash;How a|mazing
is that Wi&s;dom, which comprehends
&s;uch infinite <HI>Diver&s;ities,</HI> and <HI>Contrarieties,</HI> with|in

its Scheme! How powerful that Hand,
which <HI>bends</HI> to its own Purpo&s;e, the Good and

whil&s;t they all move them&s;elves at their <HI>own
Freedom,</HI> yet, by a &s;ecret Influence, winds
and turns them at <HI>his Will! O the depth of
the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of
God! how un&s;earchable are his judgments,
and his ways pa&s;t finding out</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 33.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>3. From what has been &s;aid, we &s;ee the
greate&s;t Rea&s;on for <HI>entire Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the
Will of Heaven, amid&s;t all Sufferings from
the <HI>Wrath</HI> and Violence of Men. The&s;e be|fal
us not <HI>in vain:</HI> they are not to be con|&s;idered
as mere Effects of the arbitrary <HI>Plea|&s;ure</HI>
and <HI>Will of Men:</HI> nor are we to believe
our&s;elves the <HI>Sport</HI> of <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI>
But, good De&s;igns are <HI>going on:</HI> GOD is al|ways
carrying forward his <HI>own Ends:</HI> And if
we are certainly a&s;&s;ured that all is tending to
<HI>his Glory,</HI> which is ever the &s;ame with the
<HI>general Good,</HI> is not this a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for
<PB N="30" REF="32">
the mo&s;t peaceable <HI>Acquie&s;cence</HI> on our Part?
Ought not we, as <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Whole,</HI> chear|fully
to re&s;ign our <HI>private</HI> Intere&s;t, to the
Advancement of a <HI>higher</HI> and more <HI>general
Good?</HI>&mdash;But moreover, by this Re&s;ignation,
our <HI>own Intere&s;t</HI> &s;hall &s;uffer nothing in the I&s;|&s;ue.
For the greatest Happine&s;s of <HI>every</HI> good
Man, of <HI>each Individual,</HI> as well as of <HI>the
whole,</HI> is comprehended in that <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> which
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is decreed to yield to GOD.
&mdash;Hence ought to ari&s;e, not unreluctant <HI>Sub|mi&s;&s;ion</HI>
only, but the mo&s;t exalted <HI>Joy</HI> in the
Divine Admini&s;tration, to all who are pious
and virtuous. In <HI>all Events,</HI> their Intere&s;t is
&s;ecur'd; and the &s;evere&s;t Trials of Life are to
them Matter even of <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Grati|tude,</HI>
when view'd in their ju&s;t Light. For,
in the&s;e very Trials, their Advantage is <HI>con&s;ult|ed;</HI>
by them is their Good <HI>promoted;</HI> and the
mo&s;t hurtful De&s;igns of the Wrath of Man are
<HI>converted</HI> into <HI>Benefits</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI>&mdash;Let this
be enough to reconcile our Minds to every
Part of our Lot; and to e&s;tabli&s;h them in the
mo&s;t comforting <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> and <HI>Confidence,</HI> in
GOD, in the Way of our Duty.&mdash;<HI>If God be
for us who,</HI> or what, <HI>can be again&s;t us?</HI> He
who can defeat all the Purpo&s;es of our <HI>Enemies,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="33">
and transform their <HI>intended Evil</HI> unto <HI>real
Good,</HI> is certainly the mo&s;t powerful <HI>Friend:</HI>
And if <HI>his Wrath</HI> be once, appeas'd, there is
no <HI>other Wrath</HI> from which we have ought
to fear.</P>
<P>4. FROM all that has been &s;aid of the Con|duct
of Providence, let us ob&s;erve, how much
Rea&s;on there is for acknowledging with Thank|fulne&s;s
the Hand of GOD, in all the&s;e <HI>Delive|rances,</HI>
which we obtain from the <HI>wrath of
man.</HI> As we ought never to forget, when we
&s;uffer by human Violence, that it is his Hand
which <HI>corrects</HI> us; &s;o, when that Violence re|ceives
a Check, we ought to remember, it is
his Hand which <HI>re&s;trains</HI> it. In <HI>both</HI> the&s;e,
the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> either <HI>permitted,</HI> or <HI>re|&s;train'd,</HI>
prai&s;es GOD: and we have &s;een him
remarkably prais'd <HI>in both.</HI>&mdash;Through all the
Steps of our late <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and our pre&s;ent
happy <HI>Deliverance,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Series</HI> of Divine
Wi&s;dom hath appear'd, as mu&s;t pre&s;ent, to the
Ob&s;ervation of every <HI>con&s;idering</HI> Spectator, a ve|ry
<HI>beautiful Scene</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of Providence.
&mdash;GOD beheld a Nation, whom he had fa|voured
with long Tranquillity and Peace, &s;unk,
by that Peace and Tranquillity, into <HI>Luxury</HI>
and <HI>Corruption of Manners.</HI> He had ble&s;s'd
<PB N="32" REF="34">
them with a happy Con&s;titution, a mild Go|vernment,
and equal Laws; but long Enjoy|ment
had <HI>deaden'd</HI> their <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of &s;o invaluable
a Ble&s;&s;ing, and fed a <HI>giddy</HI> and <HI>factious Spi|rit.</HI>
He had di&s;tingui&s;h'd them with the
pure&s;t Enjoyment of pure Religion above mo&s;t
Nations of the Earth; but their religious Pri|vileges,
<HI>once</HI> &s;truggled for with Zeal, began
to be <HI>contemn'd</HI> and their <HI>fir&s;t Love to cool.</HI>&mdash;
Behold, how <HI>opportunely</HI> GOD &s;ent forth the
<HI>wrath of man,</HI> to work a Cure for all the&s;e
Evils;&mdash;to &s;hake <HI>that Peace</HI> which had fo&s;ter|ed
<HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Impiety</HI> under its Wings; to
threaten <HI>that Religion,</HI> and <HI>that Government,</HI>
to the Ble&s;&s;ings of which we had beenin&s;en|&s;ible;
and to di&s;play before us the&s;e Terrors
of <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive Power,</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecuting Religion,</HI>
to the Danger of which we had been laid
a&s;leep:&mdash;He made us <HI>feel</HI> the Value of all we
&s;hould have lo&s;t;&mdash;he made the Evil to grow
<HI>&s;udden</HI> and <HI>unexpected,</HI> from among&s;t our&s;elves,
and allowing it to proceed &s;o far, as might be
&s;ufficient to <HI>awaken</HI> the Nation, and to ren|der
us <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> he then gave a &s;ignal
Check to the <HI>wrath of man;</HI> and <HI>re&s;train'd the
remainder of it,</HI> after it had gone the Length
which he &s;aw meet. Our Enemies boa&s;ted
<PB N="33" REF="35">
of the <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Countenance</HI> of Heaven:
<HI>Countenanced</HI> they were by Heaven, but not
for their <HI>own Sakes;</HI> and the Succe&s;s permit|ted
them for a Time, was meant for the <HI>Im|provement</HI>
and <HI>Benefit</HI> of <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> whom they in|tended
to <HI>de&s;troy.</HI> When the proper <HI>Sea&s;on</HI>
was come, for GOD to a&s;&s;ert his own Cau&s;e,
then he rais'd up an illu&s;trious <HI>Deliverer,</HI>
whom, for a Ble&s;&s;ing to his Country, he had
prepared again&s;t this <HI>Time of Need.</HI> HIM, he
crowned with the Graces of his <HI>Right-hand:</HI>
to the con&s;picuous <HI>Bravery</HI> of early <HI>Youth,</HI> he
added that <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which, in
others, is the Fruit only of <HI>long Experience;</HI>
and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Him with all tho&s;e <HI>Qualities</HI>
which render the <HI>Man,</HI> amiable; as well, as the
HERO, Great: He &s;ent him forth to be the
<HI>Terror</HI> of his Foes, the <HI>Confidence</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of
his Friends; and, in the Day of Danger and
Death, commanded the <HI>Shields of Angels</HI> to be
&s;pread around him!&mdash;What Heart, in which
the Love of BRITISH Liberty remains, <HI>warms</HI>
not at the Mention of his Name?&mdash;Who&s;e
Bo&s;om overflows not with <HI>Gratitude,</HI> when
he looks back upon the late dark and melan|choly
Scenes of <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> and
&s;urveys the fair Pro&s;pect now open'd, by this
<PB N="34" REF="36">
cho&s;en <HI>In&s;trument</HI> of our Deliverance, of <HI>Peace</HI>
re&s;tored, <HI>Liberty</HI> flouri&s;hing, and <HI>Religion</HI>
&s;afe?&mdash;Let us lift up our Eyes to Heaven,
and &s;ay, <HI>This is the doing of the Lord, and it
is marvellous in our eyes</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxviii. 23.</NOTE>!&mdash;HIM, the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> hath indeed &s;ignally <HI>prais'd,</HI> in
our Land: <HI>Prais'd</HI> him, when it rag'd; and
<HI>prais'd</HI> him, when it fell!&mdash;<HI>When he aro&s;e, his
enemies were &s;cattered; as &s;moke is driven a|way,
