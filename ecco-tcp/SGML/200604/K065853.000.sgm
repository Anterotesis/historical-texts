EDWARD GIBBON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO performance is, in my
opinion, more contempt|ible,
than a Dedication of the
common &s;ort; when &s;ome great
man is pre&s;ented with a book,
which, if Science be the &s;ubject,
he is incapable of under&s;tand|ing;
if polite Literature, inca|pable
of ta&s;ting: and this ho|nor
<PB REF="3">
is done him, as a reward
for virtues, which he neither
does, nor de&s;ires to, po&s;&s;e&s;s.
I know but two kinds of dedi|cations,
which can do honor
either to the patron or author.
The fir&s;t is, when an unexpe|rienced
writer addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf
to a ma&s;ter of the art, in which
he endeavours to excel; who&s;e
example he is ambitious of imi|tating;
by who&s;e advice he has
been directed, or who&s;e appro|bation
he is anxious to de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The other &s;ort is yet more
honourable. It is dictated by
the heart, and offered to &s;ome
per&s;on who is dear to us, becau&s;e
he ought to be &s;o. It is an
opportunity we embrace with
plea&s;ure of making public tho&s;e
&s;entiments of e&s;teem, of friend|&s;hip,
of gratitude, or of all to|gether,
which we really feel, and
which therefore we de&s;ire &s;hould
be known.</P>
<P>I hope, dear Sir, my pa&s;t
conduct will ea&s;ily lead you
<PB REF="5">
to di&s;cover to what principle
you &s;hould attribute this epi&s;tle,
which, if it &s;urprizes, will, I
hope, not di&s;plea&s;e you. If I
am capable of producing any
thing worthy the attention of
the public, it is to you that I
owe it; to that truly paternal
care, which, from the fir&s;t dawn|ings
of my rea&s;on, has always
watched over my education, and
afforded me every opportunity
of Improvement. Permit me
here to expre&s;s my grateful &s;en&s;e
<PB REF="6">
of your tenderne&s;s to me, and to
a&s;&s;ure you, that the &s;tudy of my
whole life &s;hall be to acquit my|&s;elf,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of obli|gations
I can never fully repay.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am,
dear Sir,
with the &s;incere&s;t
affection and regard,
your mo&s;t dutiful &s;on,
and faithful &s;ervant,

ESSAY
ON THE
Study of Literature.</HEAD>
<P>I. THE hi&s;tory of empires is that
of the mi&s;eries of humankind:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idea of li|terary Hi&s;|tory.</NOTE>
the hi&s;tory of the &s;ciences is that of their
&s;plendour and happine&s;s. If a thou&s;and
other con&s;iderations render the &s;tudy of
the latter intere&s;ting to the philo&s;opher,
this reflection alone is &s;ufficient to recom|mend
it to every friend of mankind.</P>
<P>II. How ardently do I wi&s;h a truth &s;o
con&s;olatory admitted of no exception!
<PB N="2" REF="8">
But alas! the man too often intrudes on
the retirement of the &s;tudent: and hence
even in his clo&s;et, that a&s;ylum of contem|plative
wi&s;dom, he is &s;till mi&s;led by his
prejudices, agitated by his pa&s;&s;ions, or de|ba&s;ed
by his follies.</P>
<P>The influence of fa&s;hion is founded
on the incon&s;tancy of man; the cau&s;es of
its de&s;poti&s;m being as frivolous as the
effects of its tyranny are fatal. Men of
letters are neverthele&s;s afraid to ca&s;t off
its yoke, and, tho' reflection cau&s;es &s;ome
delay in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it &s;erves to ren|der
it but the more di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>All ages and countries have given a
preference, not &s;eldom unju&s;tly, to &s;ome
particular &s;cience, while they permitted
others to langui&s;h and &s;ink into a con|tempt
equally unrea&s;onable. Thus Logic

and Metaphy&s;ics under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of
Alexander<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This age was that of tho&s;e philo&s;ophical &s;ects, who battled for the &s;y&s;tems of their re&s;pective ma&s;|ters, with all the ob&s;tinacy of polemical divines.</P>
<P>A fondne&s;s for &s;y&s;tems nece&s;&s;arily produces an at|tachment to general principles, and this of cour&s;e brings on a contempt for an attention to parti|culars.</P>
<P><Q>The fondne&s;s for &s;y&s;tems (&s;ays Mr. Freret) which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Ari&s;totle, made the Greeks abandon the &s;tudy of nature, and &s;topped the progre&s;s of their philo&s;ophical di&s;|coveries. Subtlety of argument took place of experiment; the accurate &s;ciences, Geometry, A&s;tronomy, and the true Philo&s;ophy di&s;appeared almo&s;t entirely. None gave them&s;elves the trouble to acquire new principles; but all were employed in ranging, combining, and modelling tho&s;e, they imagined they knew, into &s;y&s;tems. Hence aro&s;e &s;o many different &s;ects. The great|e&s;t geniu&s;es lo&s;t them&s;elves in the ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s and ob&s;curity of Metaphy&s;ics, wherein words gene|rally &s;upplied the place of things; and thus Lo|gic, denominated by Ari&s;totle an implement of the under&s;tanding, became among his followers the principal, and almo&s;t the &s;ole, object of their attention. Their whole lives were &s;pent in &s;tudying the art of rea&s;oning, without ever rea&s;oning at all; or at lea&s;t without rea&s;oning on any other than trivial and unimportant &s;ubjects.</Q></P>

the times of our fathers, have all in their
turns &s;hared the admiration and contempt
of mankind.</P>
<P>Natural Philo&s;ophy and the Mathema|tics

abilities, to trace that revolution in reli|gion,

&s;ucce&s;&s;ively bewildered, wa&s;ted, and cor|rupted
mankind. It were prudent for
him therein not to &s;eek hypothe&s;es, but
much more &s;o not to avoid them.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="12">
him&s;elf, while Homer and Cicero became
familiar to climes unknown to Alexander,
and Nations unconquered by Rome. In
tho&s;e days it was thought a fine accom|pli&s;hment
to &s;tudy and admire the An|cients
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By turning over the Latin Bibliotheque of Fa|bricius, the be&s;t of mere compilers, we &s;hall &s;ee that in the &s;pace of forty years after the invention of printing, almo&s;t all the Latin authors i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s, &s;ome of them more than once. It is true, the ta&s;te of the editors was by no means equal to their zeal. The writers of the Augu&s;tan hi&s;tory appeared before Livy; and an edition of Aulus-Gellius was given before any body thought of Virgil.</NOTE>; in ours, it is judged more ea&s;y
and polite to neglect and de&s;pi&s;e them.
I am apt to think there is &s;ome rea&s;on on
both &s;ides. The &s;oldier then read them in
his tent; the &s;tate&s;man &s;tudied them in
his clo&s;et. Even the fair &s;ex, u&s;ually con|tent

willing to re&s;ign &s;uperior knowledge to
ours, were &s;ubject to the contagion; and
every Delia wi&s;hed to find a Tibullus in
the per&s;on of her lover. It was from He|rodotus
that Elizabeth (a &s;overeign who&s;e

Ae&s;chylus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ae&s;chylus has written a tragedy, wherein he has painted, in the mo&s;t lively colours, the triumph of the Greeks and the con&s;ternation of the Per&s;ians, af|ter that fatal battle.

knowlege to the government of a
kingdom; for which the politician may
de&s;pi&s;e, and the philo&s;opher will proba|bly
blame her. The man of letters, how|ever,
cannot fail to cheri&s;h the memory
of that Prince&s;s, who not only &s;tudied the
Ancients her&s;elf, but even rewarded their
commentators. It was by her that Sau|mai&s;e
was honoured with marks of di&s;|tinction;
who, tho' he did not de&s;erve the
admiration in which his cotemporaries held
<PB N="9" REF="15">
him, was above that contempt thrown
upon him by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>IV. This Prince&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That ta&s;te carried too far.</NOTE> without doubt, car|ried
her regard for &s;uch writers too far.
For my part, tho' &s;ometimes their advo|cate,
never their parti&s;an, I will freely con|fe&s;s
I think them as coar&s;e in their manners,
as they were minute and trifling in their
works. A pedantic erudition cramping the
efforts of their imagination, they were rather
dull compilers than ingenious Scholia&s;ts.
The age was ju&s;t enlightened enough to per|ceive
the utility of their re&s;earches, but nei|ther
&s;en&s;ible, nor poli&s;hed &s;ufficiently to
know what advantages they might have
reaped, by the light of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>V. At length the day appeared.<NOTE PLACE="marg">When it became more rea|&s;onable.</NOTE> De&s;|cartes
indeed was not eminent in letters:
polite literature however is extremely ob|liged
<PB N="10" REF="16">
to him. An acute philo&s;opher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Le Clerc, in his excellent treati&s;e on the art of critici&s;m, and in many other of his works.</NOTE>,
who inherited his manner, inve&s;tigated the
true elements of critici&s;m. Bo&s;&s;u, Boi|leau,
Rapin and Brumoy informed the
public al&s;o of the value of tho&s;e trea&s;ures
it had in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. One of tho&s;e &s;o|cieties,
that have better immortalized the
name of Lewis XIV. than all the per|nicious
triumphs of his ambition, had
already begun its re&s;earches; &s;ocieties, in
which we &s;ee erudition, preci&s;ion of &s;en|timent
and politene&s;s united; in which
we meet with &s;o many important di&s;co|veries,
and &s;ometimes, what hardly yields
to di&s;coveries, a mode&s;t and learned igno|rance.</P>
<P>If men employed their rea&s;on as much
in their actions as in their conver&s;ation,
<PB N="11" REF="17">
the Belles-Lettres would not only engage
the e&s;teem of the wi&s;e, but become equal|ly
the object of vulgar admiration.</P>
<P>VI. It is from this aera we may date
the commencement of their decline.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de|cline of the Belles Lettres.</NOTE> Le
Clerc, to whom both freedom and &s;cience
are indebted, complained of it above &s;ixty
years ago. But it was in the famous di&s;|pute,
concerning the ancients and the mo|derns,
that Letters received the mortal
blow. Never &s;ure was carried on &s;o un|equal
a combat! The &s;trict logic of
Tera&s;&s;on; the refined philo&s;ophy of Fon|tenelle;
the elegant and happy manner of
De la Motte; the &s;prightly raillery of St.
Hyacinthe; all joined in concert to re|duce
Homer to a level with Chapelain.
The adver&s;aries of this formidable band
an&s;wered them only by an attention to
trifles; with I know not what preten&s;ions
<PB N="12" REF="18">
to natural &s;uperiority in the ancients; with
prejudice, abu&s;e and quotations. The
laugh was entirely again&s;t them; while
the ancients, who were the &s;ubject of the
di&s;pute, came in for a &s;hare of the ridi|cule
that bur&s;t on their defenders: that
agreeable nation, which had unthinking|ly
adopted the principle of Lord Shafte&s;|bury,
not making any di&s;tinction between
the Fal&s;e and the Ridiculous.</P>
<P>Our Philo&s;ophers have ever &s;ince affect|ed
to be a&s;toni&s;hed, that men can pa&s;s
their whole lives, in acquiring the know|lege
of mere words and facts, in bur|thening
the memory without improving
the under&s;tanding. At the &s;ame time,
our men of wit are &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of
the advantages they derive from the ig|norance
of their readers, and therefore
<PB N="13" REF="19">
load the ancients with contempt, as well
as tho&s;e who make them their &s;tudy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Fontenelle in his digre&s;&s;ion concerning the an|cients and moderns, and el&s;ewhere.</P>

<P>VII. To this picture let me &s;ubjoin a
few reflections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greatmen men of letters.</NOTE> which may fix a ju&s;t e&s;ti|mation
on the Belles Lettres.</P>
<P>The examples of great men prove no|thing.
Ca&s;&s;ini, before he acquired a
name for his a&s;tronomical di&s;coveries, had
bu&s;ied him&s;elf with judicial a&s;trology<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Fontenelle dans &s;on Eloge.</P>
<P>Voltaire, tom. xvii. p. 79.</P></NOTE>.
When &s;uch examples, however, are nu|merous,
they prejudice the mind in fa|vour
of an enquiry, the event of which
they &s;erv <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fterwards to confirm. One
mu&s;t immediately conceive that a mind
capable of thinking for it&s;elf, a lively and
<PB N="14" REF="20">
brilliant imagination, can never reli&s;h a
&s;cience that depends &s;olely on the memo|ry.
Yet of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;uperior talents
have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in&s;tructed mankind, ma|ny
have applied them&s;elves entirely to
the &s;tudy of the Belles Lettres; &s;till more
have encouraged and in a le&s;s degree cul|tivated
them; but not one, at lea&s;t hard|ly
one, of them all, ever held them in
contempt. All antiquity was known to
Grotius; a knowledge that enabled him
to unfold the Sacred Oracles, to combat
ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, to &s;often the
calamities and mitigate the horrors of
war.</P>
<P>If De&s;cartes, devoted entirely to his
Philo&s;ophy, de&s;pi&s;ed every kind of &s;tudy
that had not an immediate affinity with
<PB N="15" REF="21">
it, Newton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newton di&s;covered mi&s;takes of 5 or 6 hundred years in the common Chronology and reformed it accordingly. See my critical remarks on that Chro|nology.</NOTE> did not di&s;dain to form a
&s;y&s;tem of Chronology which has had both
its advocates and admirers: Ga&s;&s;endi, the
greate&s;t Philo&s;opher among the men of
letters, and the greate&s;t man of letters
among the Philo&s;ophers, not only defend|ed
the doctrines of Epicurus, but critical|ly
explained his writings: Leibnitz laid
a&s;ide his profound re&s;earches into hi&s;tory,
to employ him&s;elf in the more ab&s;tru&s;e
re&s;earches of the Mathematics. Had his
edition of the Capella appeared, his ex|ample
alone in that valuable acqui&s;ition
to the literary world, had ju&s;tified the con|duct
of all tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves to
letters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the life of Leibnitz, by de Neufville, pre|fixed to his Theodocea.</NOTE>. An eternal monument exi&s;ts,
<PB N="16" REF="22">
however, of the united efforts of erudi|tion
and genius, in the Dictionary of Mr.
Bayle.</P>
<P>VIII. If we confine our&s;elves to &s;uch
as have devoted almo&s;t all their time and
&s;tudy to literature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men of letters great men.</NOTE> the reader of ta&s;te
will always know how to di&s;tingui&s;h the
&s;ubtle and exten&s;ive wit of Era&s;mus; the
accuracy of Ca&s;aubon and Gerard Vo&s;&s;ius;
the readine&s;s of Ju&s;tus-Lip&s;ius; the ta&s;te
and delicacy of Taneguy-le-Febvre; the
re&s;ources and fertility of I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius; the
daring penetration of Bentley; the agree|able
manner of Ma&s;&s;ieu and de Fraguier;
the &s;olid and ingenious critici&s;m of Sallier;
and the profound philo&s;ophical genius of
Le Clerc and Freret. He will never con|found
the&s;e truly-great men with &s;uch mere
compilers as Gruter, Saumai&s;e, Ma&s;&s;on,
and many others, who&s;e works, tho' not
<PB N="17" REF="23">
altogether u&s;ele&s;s, &s;eldom gratify ta&s;te, ne|ver
excite admiration, and in general only
lay claim to the lowe&s;t kind of approba|tion.</P>
<P>IX. The ancients have left models for
&s;uch writers as dare to copy after them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TASTE. Three &s;ources of beauty.</NOTE>
and lectures to others, from which they may
deduce the principles of true ta&s;te, and
learn to employ their lei&s;ure in the &s;tudy
of tho&s;e valuable productions, wherein
truth appears embelli&s;hed with all the
graces of the imagination.</P>
<P>It is the province of Poets and Orators
to paint the beauties of nature. The whole
univer&s;e &s;upplies them with tints: of that
infinite variety, however, which on every
&s;ide pre&s;ents it&s;elf, the images they em|ploy
may be ranged in three cla&s;&s;es; tho&s;e
relating to man, to nature, and to art. The
<PB N="18" REF="24">
images of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, or tho&s;e which
compo&s;e the picture of man, his great|ne&s;s,
his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">anne&s;s, his pa&s;&s;ions, his ca|prices;
the&s;e are they which conduct the
writer in the &s;ure&s;t path to immortality.
Every time one reads Euripides or Te|rence,
one di&s;covers new beauties. It is
not, however, to the di&s;po&s;ition or con|duct
of their performances, which are in
this re&s;pect often defective; nor is it to
their delicacy or &s;implicity of &s;tile, that
the&s;e Poets owe their reputation. No,
the heart beholds the picture of it&s;elf in
their ju&s;t and lively de&s;criptions, and con|fe&s;&s;es
it with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Nature, va&s;t and exten&s;ive as it is, hath
furni&s;hed the Poets with but few images.
Confined by the nature of the object,
or the prejudices of mankind, to the ex|terior
of things, they have &s;ucceeded only
in painting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive variety of the
<PB N="19" REF="25">
&s;ea&s;ons; a &s;ea agitated by &s;torms; the Ze|phyrs,
wafting love and plea&s;ure on the
breeze, and the like. A few writers of
genius were enow to exhau&s;t the&s;e images.</P>
<P>X. Tho&s;e of art remained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial images.</NOTE> By the
images of art I mean all tho&s;e things,
by which men have embelli&s;hed, defaced,
or diver&s;ified nature, religion, laws or cu&s;|tom.
The Poets have univer&s;ally made
free with all the&s;e, and it mu&s;t be owned
they were in the right. Their fellow-coun|trymen
under&s;tood them with ea&s;e, and
peru&s;ed them with plea&s;ure. They were
plea&s;ed to &s;ee the genius of their great
men exerci&s;ed on things which had made
their ance&s;tors re&s;pectable, on &s;ubjects they
revered as &s;acred, or practi&s;ed as u&s;eful.</P>

more favourable to Poetry than ours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ners of the ancients favourable to poetry.</NOTE>

<P>Are the battles, however, which are de|&s;cribed
by the French Poet, diver&s;ified like
tho&s;e of the Greek? Are his heroes equal|ly
intere&s;ting? The &s;ingle combats of the
chiefs, the long conver&s;ations held with
the dying, the unexpected rencounters
we meet with; all betray the imperfection
of the military art; but furni&s;h the Poet
with the means of making us acquainted
with his heroes, and intere&s;ting us in their
good or ill fortune. At pre&s;ent, armies

of their General. The mu&s;e denies her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the de&s;cription of their evo|lutions:

<P>XII. The ancient republics of Greece
were ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of good
policy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In govern|ment.</NOTE> The people met in tumultuous

Their factions were impetuous

in&s;titutions, which, projected in the
cabinet of a Sovereign or his council, dif|fu&s;e
happine&s;s over a whole nation, excite
only the Poet's admiration, the colde&s;t of
all the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>XIII. The ancient mythology,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In reli|gion.</NOTE> which
attributed life and intelligence to all nature,
extended its influence to the pen of the
Poet. In&s;pired by the mu&s;e, he &s;ung the
attributes, the adventures and misfortunes
of his fabulous deities. That Infinite Be|ing,
which religion and philo&s;ophy have
made known to us, is above &s;uch de&s;crip|tion:
the &s;ublime&s;t flights become puerile
on &s;uch a &s;ubject. The almighty <HI>Fiat</HI> of
Mo&s;es &s;trikes us with admiration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the pieces of Huet and De&s;preaux, in the 3d vol. of the works of the latter.</NOTE>; but
<PB N="24" REF="30">
rea&s;on cannot comprehend, nor imagina|tion
de&s;cribe, the operations of a deity,
at who&s;e command alone millions of

read with any &s;atisfactory plea&s;ure of the
devil, in Milton, warring for two whole

Omnipotent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The golden compa&s;&s;es, with which the Creator, in Milton, mea&s;ures the univer&s;e, excite &s;urprize. Perhaps, however, it is puerile in him; tho' &s;uch an image had been truly &s;ublime in Homer. Our philo&s;ophical ideas of the Deity are injurious to the Poet. The &s;ame attributes deba&s;e our Divinity which would have extolled the Jupiter of the Greeks. The &s;ublime genius of Milton was cramped by the &s;y&s;tem of our religion, and never appeared to &s;o great an advantage as when he &s;hook it a little off; while on the contrary, Propertius, a cold and in&s;ipid declaimer, owes all his reputation to the agreeable pictures of his Mythology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31">
The ancients knew their advantages, and
profited by them accordingly. Of this
the ma&s;terly performances we &s;till admire
are the be&s;t proofs.</P>
<P>XIV. But we,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The means of perceiving their beau|ties.</NOTE> who are placed in another
clime, and born in another age, are nece&s;&s;a|rily
at a lo&s;s to &s;ee tho&s;e beauties, for want
of being able to place our&s;elves in the &s;ame
point of view with the Greeks and Ro|mans.
A circum&s;tantial knowlege of their
&s;ituation and manners can only enable us
to do this. The &s;uperficial ideas, the poor
information we glean from a commentary,
a&s;&s;i&s;t us only to &s;eize the more palpable
and apparent beauties: all the graces, all
the delicacies of their writings e&s;cape us;
and we are apt to abu&s;e their contempo|raries
for want of ta&s;te, in lavi&s;hing &s;uch
encomiums on tho&s;e merits we are too ig|norant
to di&s;cover. An acquaintance with
<PB N="26" REF="32">
antiquity is the only true comment on the
writings of the ancients: but what is &s;till
more nece&s;&s;ary, is a certain turn of mind,
which is generally the re&s;ult of it; a &s;en|timent
not only making things known,
but familiarizing them to our ideas, and
inducing us to regard them with the eyes
of ancients. The famous example of Per|rault
may &s;erve to illu&s;trate my meaning.
The rudene&s;s of the heroic ages &s;hocked
the delicacy of the Pari&s;ian. It was in vain
that Boileau remon&s;trated to him, that
Homer de&s;igned and ought to de&s;cribe
Greeks and not Frenchmen: his judgment
was convinced it was right, but he could
not be per&s;uaded to be plea&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See De&s;preaux's remarks on Longinus.</NOTE>. A &s;mall
portion of antique ta&s;te, if I may &s;o call

<P><PB N="27" REF="33">
XV. I have &s;aid that the Poets were
in the right to make u&s;e of artificial ima|ges;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial images depend on love of fame.</NOTE>
but I know not whether at the tri|bunal
of fame it will be allowed me. We
are all fond of reputation; but nothing is
more different than the nature and de|gree
of our pa&s;&s;ion for fame. Every man
has different notions in his de&s;ire of re|putation.
One writer, for in&s;tance, &s;eeks
only the prai&s;e of his contemporaries. Death
puts an end to his hopes and fears of cen|&s;ure
or applau&s;e; he cares not, if in the
tomb that enclo&s;es his body be buried al&s;o
his name. Such a man may, without
&s;cruple, employ familiar and temporary
images, in writing for tho&s;e whom only
he de&s;ires to plea&s;e. Another, on the
contrary, bequeaths his name to late&s;t po&s;|terity
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mallet's life of Bacon, p. 27.</NOTE>; and plea&s;es him&s;elf in thinking
that a thou&s;and years after his death, the
<PB N="28" REF="34">
Indian on the banks of the Ganges, and
the Laplander on his hills of &s;now, will
read his works, and envy the happy clime
and aera that produced &s;o extraordinary a
genius.</P>
<P>The&s;e who are ambitious to plea&s;e uni|ver&s;ally,
mu&s;t deduce their images from
the common re&s;ources of mankind, from
the human heart and the repre&s;entations
of nature. Pride only can induce writers
to exceed the&s;e bounds. They may pre|&s;ume,
indeed, that the occult beauties of
their writings will always &s;ecure a family of
Burmans, to labour in their explication,
and to admire the text the more becau&s;e
they them&s;elves have written the comment.</P>
<P>XVI. It is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And on the nature of the &s;ubject.</NOTE> however, the charac|ter
of the author altogether, but that of
his work, which influences him in this
<PB N="29" REF="35">
particular. The &s;ublimer &s;pecies of Poe|try,
the epopeia, the tragedy, the ode,
&s;eldom employ the &s;ame images as come|dy
and &s;atire; becau&s;e the former are
chiefly de&s;criptive of the pa&s;&s;ions, and the
latter of manners. Horace and Plautus
are almo&s;t unintelligible to tho&s;e who have
not learnt to live and think as the Ro|mans.
The rival of the latter, the ele|gant
Terence, is better under&s;tood, be|cau&s;e
he has &s;acrificed plea&s;antry to ta&s;te;
whereas Plautus has even pro&s;tituted de|cency
to mirth. Terence, one is apt to
think, imagined he was de&s;cribing the
Athenians: his pieces are all over Greek,
excepting the language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Teren. Eunuch. act ii. &s;c. 2. Heauton, act i. &s;c. 1. The <HI>Cupedinarii</HI> Terence &s;peaks of, di&s;prove not the truth of this reflection.

It is impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend the

ancient Italy; the character of Augu&s;tus;
and of that particular and &s;ingular rela|tion

he bore to the &s;enate and the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Di&s;&s;ertations of Mr. de la Bleterie on the authority of the Emperors, in the Memoirs of the academy of the Belles-Lettres. Vol. xix. p. 357. Vol. xxi. p. 299, &amp;c. Vol. xxiv. p. 261, &amp;c. p. 297, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
Nothing could be more &s;triking, or inter|e&s;ting
to this people, than the contra&s;t
between Rome, with its three thou&s;and
citizens living in hovels thatched with
&s;traw<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Varro de lingua Latina, lib. iv.&mdash;Diony&s;ius Ha|licarna&s;. lib. xi. p. 76. Plutarch. in Rom.</NOTE>, and the &s;ame Rome the metro|polis
of the univer&s;e, who&s;e hou&s;es were
palaces, who&s;e citizens Princes, and who&s;e
provinces were exten&s;ive empires. As
Florus has remarked this contra&s;t, it is
not to be thought Virgil was regardle&s;s
of it. He has &s;truck it off in a mo&s;t ma&s;|terly
manner. Evander conducts his gue&s;t
thro' that village, where every thing, even
<PB N="32" REF="38">
its monarch, was all ru&s;ticity. He ex|plains
its antiquities; while the Poet gives

<P>XVIII. The better one is acquainted
with antiquity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad|dre&s;s of Virgil.</NOTE> the more one admires the
art and addre&s;s of the Poet. His &s;ubject,
<PB N="33" REF="39">
it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was flat enough.
The flight of a band of refugees; their
&s;quabbles with a few villagers, and the
&s;ettling of a paltry town; the&s;e were the
boa&s;ted labours, the great exploits of the
pious Aeneas. But the Poet has dignified
them, and in &s;o doing has had art enough
to render them intere&s;ting. By an illu|&s;ion,
too refined not to have e&s;caped the
generality of readers, and too excellent to
di&s;plea&s;e the critic, he hath embelli&s;hed
the rude manners of the heroic ages, but
has done it without di&s;gui&s;ing them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing is more difficult for a writer, educated in &s;cenes of luxury, than to de&s;cribe &s;implicity with|out meanne&s;s. Read the epi&s;tle of Penelope, in Ovid, and you will be di&s;gu&s;ted with that ru&s;ticity which gives &s;o much delight, in Homer. In the writings of Madam Scudery, you will be as di&s;agreeably &s;ur|prized to find, in the court of Tomyris, the &s;plen|dour of that of Louis the XIVth. One mu&s;t be form|ed for &s;uch manners to hit off their genuine &s;impli|city. Reflection has &s;upplied the place of experi|ence in Virgil, and perhaps in Fenelon. They knew it was nece&s;&s;ary to elevate them a little, in conformity to the delicacy of their age and country; but they knew that delicacy would be &s;hocked at too taudry embelli&s;hments.</NOTE>.
<PB N="34" REF="40">
The herd&s;man Latinus, and the quarrel|&s;ome
Turnus, are indeed elevated into
great monarchs. All Italy trembles for
the cau&s;e of liberty: and Aeneas triumphs
over gods and men. Virgil knew how to
reflect all the glory of the Romans on their
Trojan ance&s;tors. The founder of Rome
eclip&s;es that of Lavinium. It is a fire that
kindles, and pre&s;ently blazes over the face
of the earth. Aeneas, if I may &s;o venture
to expre&s;s my&s;elf, contained the germe of
all his de&s;cendants. When be&s;ieged in
his camp, he naturally calls to mind a
<PB N="35" REF="41">
Cae&s;ar and an Alexis. We cannot divide
our admiration between them.</P>
<P>But Virgil never di&s;played greater ad|dre&s;s
than when, de&s;cended with his hero,
to the &s;hades, his imagination &s;eemed at
full liberty. Yet here he neither created
new nor imaginary beings. Romulus and
Brutus, Scipio and Cae&s;ar appeared, &s;uch
as they had been in life, the admiration or
terrour of Rome.</P>
<P>XIX. One reads the Georgics with that
lively ta&s;te the beautiful excites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Georgics.</NOTE> and that
exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure the charms of the &s;ub|ject

It is ea&s;y to conceive, however, that our
admiration would be increa&s;ed, by di&s;co|vering
in the Poet a de&s;ign equally noble
and elevated, as the execution of it is
highly fini&s;hed. I con&s;tantly draw my
<PB N="36" REF="42">
examples from Virgil. His fine ver&s;es,
and the precepts of his friend Horace,
fixed the &s;tandard of ta&s;te among the Ro|mans,
and may &s;erve to convey in&s;truc|tion
to the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity. But
to explain my &s;entiments more clearly,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to trace things a little far|ther.</P>

critici&s;m. Time, who&s;e ju&s;tice, &s;low yet

of the critic. De&s;titute of ob&s;erva|tions,
he hath advanced chimeras in&s;tead
of facts. Formed in the &s;chool of Plato,
<PB N="46" REF="52">
and by the writings of Homer, Sophocles,
Euripides and Thucidides, he hath drawn
his rules from the nature of things, and a
knowlege of the human heart; illu&s;trating
them by examples from the greate&s;t models
of antiquity.</P>
<P>It is now two thou&s;and years &s;ince the
days of Ari&s;totle. The critics have &s;ince
improved their art; they are not, how|ever,
as yet agreed concerning the object
of their pur&s;uit. Le Clerc, Cou&s;in, Des-Mai&s;eaux,
St. Martha<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clerici ars critica, lib. i. c. 1.</NOTE>, have all defined
it differently. For my part, I think eve|ry
one of them too partial or too po&s;itive.
Critici&s;m is, in my opinion, the art of
forming a judgment of writings and writ|ers;
of what they have &s;aid; of what they
have &s;aid well, and what they have &s;aid
<PB N="47" REF="53">
truly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torically &s;o; the truth of their evidence, not of their opinions; the latter is in the province of logic rather than of critici&s;m.</NOTE>. Under the fir&s;t head are compre|hended
grammar, a knowledge of langua|ges,

&s;uppo&s;ed from genuine perfor|mances,
and of re&s;toring the true reading
of corrupted pa&s;&s;ages. Under the &s;econd,
is included the whole theory of elocution

field, the enquiry into the circum&s;tances
and truth of facts. Thus the whole ge|neration
of critics may be di&s;tingui&s;hed
under three kinds, grammarians, rhetori|cians

fine ta&s;te, acute penetration, are all nece&s;|&s;ary
to form a good critic. Follow the

XXX. The people of Ardea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Roman &s;ubjects.</NOTE> Antium
and Terra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">inia, were not then &s;ubjects of

exi&s;ting in the time of Brutus; and
we &s;hall deduce, from the politics of
the Romans, a definition of the term Ally,
very different from what we &s;hould lay
down at pre&s;ent. Rome, altho' the la&s;t
colony of the Latins, begun very early to
form the project of &s;ubjecting the whole
nation to its laws. Its di&s;cipline and po|lice,
its heroes, its victories, &s;oon mani|fe&s;ted
its inconte&s;tible &s;uperi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rity. The
Romans, not le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> politic than bold, made

knew well that cities ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;ubjected would
&s;top the progre&s;s of their arms, would
<PB N="57" REF="63">
wa&s;te the trea&s;ures, and corrupt the man|ners
of the republic. Under the more
&s;pecious name, therefore, of allies, they
reconciled the vanqui&s;hed to the yoke of
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; while the latter con&s;ented with
plea&s;ure to acknowlege Rome as the ca|pital
of the Latin nation, and to furni&s;h it
with a quota of troops in its wars. The
republic, in return, afforded them only
bare protection, the mark of that &s;ove|reignty
which co&s;t its va&s;&s;als &s;o dear.
The&s;e people were indeed denominated al|lies
to Rome; but they &s;oon found them|&s;elves
no better than her &s;laves.</P>
<P>XXXI. This explication, it may be
&s;aid, dimini&s;hes the difficulty, but does
not remove it. <GAP DESC="foreign">, the word Poly|bius

not di&s;pute it. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
we have only a tran&s;lation of this treaty;
and though we &s;hould conditionally admit
the copie&s;ts to be depended on, as to the
main &s;ub&s;tance and tenour of it, their ex|pre&s;&s;ions
ought not to be &s;trictly taken

&s;o different and changeable, that
the mo&s;t able tran&s;lator may long look
for equivalent expre&s;&s;ions, and find at la&s;t

language of this treaty was antique. Po|lybius

&s;ubject. <HI>Foederati,</HI> &s;aid they, does not di|rectly

XXXII. Again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ma|rine.</NOTE> the Roman marine is
an object of no little embarra&s;&s;ment to the
critics. Polybius him&s;elf however a&s;&s;ures
us, that the fleet of Duillius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polybius, lib. i. c. 20.</NOTE> was their fir&s;t
e&s;&s;ay of this kind. Polybius therefore mu&s;t
be in one ca&s;e or the other mi&s;taken, &s;ince
he contradicts him&s;elf; which is all the
conclu&s;ion I &s;hall draw from the matter.
But even admitting the truth of his rela|tion,
the Roman hi&s;tory does not therefore
fall to the ground. The following hy|pothe&s;is
affords a probable &s;olution of this
paradox; and that is as much as can be
rea&s;onably expected of an hypothe&s;is. Tar|quin
oppre&s;&s;ed both his &s;ubjects and the
army. He &s;eized, and appropriated to
him&s;elf, their plunder; which gave them
a di&s;gu&s;t to military expeditions. They
fitted out, therefore, &s;mall &s;loops, and
<PB N="60" REF="66">
went to cruize at &s;ea. The infant repub|lic
protected them, but, by this treaty,
laid a re&s;traint on their depredations.
The continual wars, in which it was af|terwards
engaged, and wherein the land
forces were well paid, made this marine ne|glected;
and, in an age or two, it was even
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> that it had ever exi&s;ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the fleet that appeared be|fore Tarentum; as I imagine tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els belonged to the inhabitants of Thuricum.</P>

The writer who knows the&s;e only

<P>The&s;e are the expre&s;&s;ions Virgil has put in the mouth of Jupiter. But our chronologi&s;ts give them|&s;elves no concern to make the Thunderer keep his word. They repre&s;ent the city of Alba as de&s;troyed by Tullus Ho&s;tilius almo&s;t 500 years after its foun|dation, and about 100 years after that of Rome<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">See les Tables Chronolog. d'Helvicus.</NOTE>. The &s;y&s;tem of Sir I&s;aac Newton, however, makes all ea&s;y. The de&s;truction of Troy, placed in the year 904, and followed by an interval of 337 years, brings us down to 567, 60 years after the Palilia, an epoch that agrees much better with the reign of the third &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Romulus<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">Newton's Chronology, p. 52, &amp;c.</NOTE>. There is an an|cient tradition, pre&s;erved by Plutarch<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot">See Plutarch. in Numa.</NOTE>, which exactly coincides. The books of Nama were found ann. ante Chr. 181. four hundred years after the death of that King, and the commencement of the reign of Ho&s;tilius. Numa died then 581 years be|fore the Chri&s;tian aera. How artful was it in the Poet to lay hold of the time Aeneas arrives at Car|thage, to reply to his critics, in the only manner the rapidity of his cour&s;e, and the greatne&s;s of his &s;ub|ject would permit him! He makes it appear, that, according to his theory, this rencounter of Dido and Aeneas is not a poetic licence. Virgil is not the only one who hath called in que&s;tion the vulgar chro|nology of the Latin Kings. I imagine I can trace the &s;ame ideas in his contemporary Pompeius. That hi&s;torian, the rival of Livy and Sallu&s;t<NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot">Flav. Vopi&s;c. in proem. Aurelian.</NOTE>, attributes the &s;ame period of duration, 300 years, to the king|dom of Alba. Had not his univer&s;al hi&s;tory been lo&s;t, we &s;hould probably have there found particular and circum&s;tantial proofs of this opinion. As it is, we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with the &s;imple expo&s;ition of his abbreviator. "Albam longam condidit quae trecen|tis annis caput regni fuit<NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot"> Ju&s;|tin. lib. xliii. c. 1.</NOTE>." Livy him&s;elf, that father of Roman hi&s;tory, who &s;ometimes &s;hews &s;o great an attachment to the vulgar chronology, but generally runs over the difficult pa&s;&s;ages in a manner that betrays his credulity and ignorance, &s;eems to di&s;tru&s;t his guides in tho&s;e early ages<NOTE N="(13)" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. lib. i. c. 18. and el&s;ewhere.</NOTE>. Nothing was more natural than for him to take notice how long tho&s;e Kings reigned, whom he mentions<NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot">Livy, lib. i. c. 9.</NOTE>. Yet is he entirely &s;ilent on this head. Nothing was more nece&s;&s;ary than to a&s;certain, at lea&s;t, the inter|val between Aeneas and Romulus; which he has not|with&s;tanding neglected.

"The de|&s;truction of Alba, he &s;ays, happened 400 years af|ter it was founded<NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot">Idem. lib. i. c. 29.</NOTE>." In retrenching an 100 years for the reigns of Romulus and of Numa, and for the half of that of Ho&s;tilius, there remain ju&s;t 300, in&s;tead of 400, as is given by the chronology of Erato&s;thenes. Livy therefore nearly agrees with Vir|gil, the little difference between them &s;erving rather to confirm than di&s;&s;olve their agreement.&mdash;I fore&s;ee an objection, but as it is one of the mo&s;t trivial, to reply to it would be only to form mon&s;ters for the &s;ake of &s;ubduing them: I &s;hall therefore fini&s;h this digre&s;&s;ion, already too long.</P></NOTE>.</P>

will leave us in great doubt concern|ing
the nature of this talent; and this may
not unrea&s;onably lead us to doubt al&s;o,
whether it has fallen to their lot. With
&s;ome it con&s;i&s;ts in a humour for &s;triking

every e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, whether that
of a Socrates, or a Spani&s;h inqui&s;itor, for
no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e it is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed.
With others again, it is the &s;ame
thing as a talent for Geometry, that haugh|ty
and imperious &s;cience, which, not con|tent

that enterprizing &s;pirit, who&s;e errours have
&s;ometimes led the way to truth, and who&s;e
very extravagancies, like the rebellion of
a people, have in&s;pired a &s;alutary indigna|tion

<P>A philo&s;ophical genius con&s;i&s;ts in the
capacity of recurring to the mo&s;t &s;imple

ideas; in di&s;covering and combining the
fir&s;t principles of things. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of
this di&s;tingui&s;hing faculty has a view as
piercing as exten&s;ive. Situated on an emi|nence,
he takes in a wide exten&s;ive field,
of which he forms a preci&s;e and exact idea;
while a genius of an inferiour ca&s;t, tho'
what he &s;ees he di&s;tingui&s;hes with equal
preci&s;ion, is more contracted in his views,
and di&s;covers only a part of the whole.
A philo&s;opher may be a mathematician, a
mu&s;ician, an antiquary; but in every thing
he is &s;till the philo&s;opher; and, in con&s;e|quence
of his abilities, to comprehend the
fir&s;t principles of his art, he ri&s;es &s;uperi|our
to every other arti&s;t. Placed among
that &s;mall number of geniu&s;es, formed for
&s;o arduous a ta&s;k, he labours to compleat
that elementary &s;cience, to which, if once
brought to perfection, every other mu&s;t

<PB N="91" REF="97">
genius is very uncommon. There
are many men capable of forming particu|lar
ideas with preci&s;ion; but there are few
who can comprehend, in one ab&s;tract idea,
a numerous a&s;&s;ociation of others, le&s;s ge|neral.</P>

<P>It will appear unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve to
tho&s;e, who&s;e judgment is &s;uperiour to their

&s;uch as one may di&s;cover in con&s;equence

exactly the &s;ame thing with an age, or a
nation, as with the individual. Alexander
di&s;plays his character more in the tent of
Darius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quintus Curtius de Reb. Ge&s;t. Alexandri, lib. iii. c. 32.</NOTE> than in the field of battle. I di&s;|cover
as much the ferocity of the Roman
people in their condemnation of an unhap|py
criminal, to be torn to pieces in the
amphitheatre, as in their &s;trangling a cap|tive
King before the capitol. There is no
preparatory di&s;gui&s;e to trivial actions. We

I undertake to determine, whether virtue
<PB N="103" REF="109">

actions rather than their di&s;cour&s;e. In or|der
to condemn them as vicious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dif|ference between virtue and vice.</NOTE> I &s;hould
attend rather to their words than their ac|tions.
Virtue is prai&s;ed without being
known; known without being felt; and
felt without being practi&s;ed; but the
ca&s;e is different with vice. We are led to
vice by our pa&s;&s;ions, and defend it by
&s;ubtlety of rea&s;oning. There are be&s;ides
bad men in all ages and countries: but, if
the depravation be not too general, even
the&s;e will &s;hew &s;ome re&s;pect to the times.
If the age it&s;elf is vicious, (and they are
apt enough to di&s;cern this) they hold it in
contempt, &s;hew them&s;elves openly what
they are, and laugh at penalties, which
they flatter them&s;elves will fall but lightly.
In this al&s;o they are never deceived. The

the force of rhetoric only to di&s;play the

the reader by &s;en&s;ible and profound

united &s;ufficient to cru&s;h a new pretender.</P>
<P>LXXX.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;es of it.</NOTE> Tho&s;e fortunate circum&s;tances
of the debauchery of Anthony, the weak|ne&s;s
of Lepidus, and the credulity of
Cicero, operated in concert with the ge|neral
di&s;po&s;ition, in his favour: but it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that tho' he did not
give birth to the&s;e circum&s;tances, he em|ployed
them with great art and policy.
The va&s;t variety of objects, that pre&s;ent
them&s;elves, will not permit to di&s;play the
nature of that refined government; to de|&s;cribe
<PB N="158" REF="164">
the yoke that was borne without
being felt, the Prince undi&s;tingui&s;hed
from the citizens, or the &s;enate re&s;pected
by its ma&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is with impatience I expect the continuation of tho&s;e di&s;&s;ertations on this &s;ubject, which M. de la Bleterie hath promi&s;ed us. The &s;y&s;tem of Augu&s;|tus, &s;o often mi&s;under&s;tood, will be laid down with the utmo&s;t minutene&s;s. This author hath a peculiar delicacy, and an amiable freedom, of &s;entiment. He is argumentative without dryne&s;s, and expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf with all the graces of a clear and elegant &s;tile. Perhaps, however, this De&s;cartes of hi&s;tory rea|&s;ons a little too much <HI>a priori,</HI> and founds his con|clu&s;ions le&s;s upon authority of particular facts, than on general induction: but this is the fault only of men of great genius.</NOTE>. We will &s;elect, however,
one circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tus, ma&s;ter of the revenues of the

public. By which means he di&s;played his
moderation, in having bequeathed to his
heirs effects of le&s;s value than the fortunes
of many of his &s;ubjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;tus bequeathed to Tiberius and Livia only millies quingenties, thirty millions of livres. The augur Lentulus died in his reign, worth qua|ter millies, four&s;core millions. Sueton. lib. ii. c. 101.&mdash;Seneca de Benefic. lib. ii.</NOTE>; and his love to
his country, in having given up to the &s;er|vice
of the &s;tate two entire patrimonies;
together with an immen&s;e &s;um, ari&s;ing from
the legacies of his decea&s;ed friends.</P>
<P>LXXXI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame action both cau&s;e and effect.</NOTE> An ordinary degree of pene|tration
is &s;ufficient to di&s;cover when an
action is at once both cau&s;e and effect.
In the moral world there are many &s;uch;
or rather, there are but few, which do not,
<PB N="160" REF="166">
more or le&s;s, partake of both the one
and the other.</P>
<P>The corruption of all orders of men
among the Romans, was owing to the ex|tent
of their empire, and was it&s;elf pro|ductive
of the greatne&s;s of the republic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;q. Con&s;id. &s;ur la Grandeur des Romains.
I di&s;tingui&s;h the greatne&s;s of the Roman em|pire from that of the republic: the one con&s;i&s;ted in the number of provinces, the other in that of its citizens.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But it requires an uncommon &s;hare of
judgment, when two things are con&s;tantly
united, and &s;eem intimately connected, to
di&s;cern that they are neither effect nor
cau&s;e to one another.</P>

LXXXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ci|ences do not ari&s;e from luxu|ry.</NOTE> The &s;ciences, it is &s;aid, take
their ri&s;e from luxury; an enlightened
mu&s;t be always a vicious people. For
my part, I cannot be of this opinion.
The &s;ciences are not the daughters of
luxury, but both the one and the other
owe their birth to indu&s;try. The arts,
in their rude&s;t &s;tate, &s;atisfied the primi|tive
wants of men. In their &s;tate of per|fection
they &s;ugge&s;t new ones, even from
Vitellius's &s;hield of Pallas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vitellius &s;ent his gal'ies as far as the pillars of Hercules, in order to catch the uncommon and delicate fi&s;h, of which this luxurious di&s;h was com|po&s;ed.

<P>Thus have I thrown together a few re|flections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu|&s;ion.</NOTE>
which appeared to me ju&s;t and
rational, on the utility of the Belles-Lettres.
Happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf, if, by &s;o
doing, I &s;hould in&s;pire a ta&s;te for them
in others. I &s;hould entertain too good
an opinion of my&s;elf, if I did not &s;ee the
imperfections of this E&s;&s;ay; and &s;hould
have too bad a one if I did not hope,
at an age le&s;s premature, and with a more
exten&s;ive knowlege, to be able to correct
<PB N="163" REF="169">
them. It may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aid, the&s;e re|flections
are ju&s;t, but hackneyed and trite,
or that they are new, but paradoxical.
Where is the author who loves the critics?
The former imputation, however, will
di&s;plea&s;e me lea&s;t; the advantage of the
art being more dear to me than the repu|tation
of the arti&s;t.</P>
