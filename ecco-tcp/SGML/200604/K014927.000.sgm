<P>THE Editor of Mr. SHERIDAN'S
Speech, which has been collected with
great diligence, and corrected with great
attention, will make no apology for giving to
the world the celebrated Oration, which all the
world could not po&s;&s;ibly hear. For arrange|ment
of matter, acutene&s;s of ob&s;ervation, point|edne&s;s
of &s;arca&s;m, and pathos of expre&s;&s;ion, this
Speech, which excited expectation without di&s;|appointment,
has been &s;eldom &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, and
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
&s;eldomer equalled. It is, however, fair for
Mr. Ha&s;tings's friends to reque&s;t, that judg|ment
may be &s;u&s;pended till the other &s;ide &s;hall
be heard; &s;ince brilliancy of eloquence, and
cogency of proof have very different effects on
judicious minds.</P>

SPEECH
IN
WESTMINSTER HALL,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>TUESDAY, JUNE THE 3d, 1788.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE Court being &s;eated preci&s;ely at twelve o'clock,
MR. SHERIDAN aro&s;e.&mdash;It would be &s;uperfluous,
he ob&s;erved, for him to call the attention of their
Lord&s;hips to the magnitude and importance of the &s;ubject
before them; to advert to the parties who were engaged in
the bu&s;ine&s;s; or to depict the &s;ituation of tho&s;e multitudes
who were ultimately to be affected. All this had already
been done by the Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Burke) who opened
the pro&s;ecution;&mdash;by him, who, alone, was equal to the
ta&s;k;&mdash;by him, to whom mankind was indebted for the em|bodied
&s;tand, which was now made in defence of the general
rights of humanity.&mdash;Neither was it his intention to enter
into any detail which might be deemed foreign to the quef|tion
immediately before the Court:&mdash;he would only indulge
him&s;elf in a few words re&s;pecting &s;ome in&s;inuations which
had been thrown out again&s;t the per&s;ons concerned in this
pro&s;ecution. It had been whi&s;pered, by whom he could not
&s;ay, that there was &s;omething malicious, and &s;omething,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
perhaps, too violent in the manner in which it had been con|ducted.
Speaking for him&s;elf, and as far as the heart of
man could be known, for the other managers appointed by
the Commons, he would boldly a&s;&s;ert, that they had acted
&s;olely from conviction; not a conviction born in error, and
nur&s;ed by prejudice; but a conviction founded on deliberate
and well-grounded enquiry;&mdash;that they had proceeded, not as
rejoicing in puni&s;hment, but impelled by a &s;anguine hope of
remedy.&mdash;Per&s;onal malice! God forbid that they &s;hould
indulge &s;uch a &s;en&s;ation again&s;t the unfortunate gentleman
at the bar; but how, when they were to &s;peak of Rapine,
of Cruelty, and of Extortion, could &s;uch ideas be conveyed
but in con&s;onant language? There was undoubtedly a diffe|rence
between Impeachment for capital Crimes, and tho&s;e
for Mi&s;demeanours only. In proceedings on the former,
every latitude had been indulged by u&s;age, every aggrava|tion
was employed, and every act of the Pri&s;oner tortured
into Criminality. No &s;uch privilege was claimed by the
managers on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; but yet it &s;hould be con|&s;idered
by tho&s;e, who&s;e pity &s;eemed to ri&s;e in proportion
with the guilt of its object;&mdash;that if &s;uch a mode of proceed|ing
was admi&s;&s;ible in the former Ca&s;e, where the life of the
Pri&s;oner was affected, it was &s;till more ju&s;tifiable on an Im|peachment
like the pre&s;ent; where the utmo&s;t con&s;equences
of guilt, when proved, would be but a <HI>&s;plendid exclu&s;ion</HI> of
the Criminal from that Society which he had injured, or a
<HI>trifling deduction</HI> from the &s;poils of a long continued Extor|tion.</P>
<P>It had been ob&s;erved what was undoubtedly true, that no
complaint from the natives of India had been pre&s;ented in
the cour&s;e of the&s;e proceedings. Tho&s;e, however, who were
fir&s;t to make this ob&s;ervation, were fully convinced that
meekne&s;s in &s;uffering was there a part of the national cha|racter,
and that their terrors had been too deeply impre&s;&s;ed,
not to be long remembered. But though a de&s;pair of Briti&s;h
Ju&s;tice had prevailed through that Penin&s;ula;&mdash;though their
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;ubdued hearts could not even hope for relief;&mdash;yet their
claims on the Ju&s;tice and Humanity of their Lord&s;hips were
not thereby dimini&s;hed, but recommended. He would not
mention this De&s;pair, without accompanying the ob&s;ervation
by proof; he therefore read Extracts from two Letters, the
fir&s;t, lately received from Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI>; the &s;econd, en|clo&s;ed
from Captain Kirkpatrick to his Lord&s;hip: from both
which it appeared, that &s;uch was the prevailing &s;en&s;e through
India, of the injuries inflicted by the Engli&s;h, and of their
repeated violations of every compact, that it would be long
indeed before their confidence in Engli&s;h faith, or their re|liance
on Engli&s;h ju&s;tice, could again be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>To the&s;e complaints their Lord&s;hips were now to an&s;wer,
not by profe&s;&s;ions, but by facts;&mdash;not by remedial acts di|rected
to the future, but by an exemplary puni&s;hment in|flicted
on pa&s;t delinquency. It was incumbent on them to
&s;hew to the oppre&s;&s;ed natives of India, and to future Go|vernors
and Judges, that there could be no authority &s;o high,
no office &s;o &s;acred, as not to be &s;ubject to the paramount
power of Briti&s;h Ju&s;tice.&mdash;He did not, however, mean to
&s;ay, that the Example &s;hould be made, unle&s;s the Guilt was
fir&s;t fully proved: No, God forbid, that in this free and
ju&s;t land, legal proof and legal guilt &s;hould ever be &s;epa|rated!
&mdash;Though the greater part of the Evidence on this
occa&s;ion had been, with a few exceptions, wrung from the
unrelenting accomplices of the pri&s;oner&mdash;from men who had
partook of the &s;poils, and were involved in the guilt; yet
had he therefore no indulgence to demand, nor had he to
reque&s;t that the Court &s;hould take that as evidence on this
occa&s;ion, which on any other they might deem them&s;elves
bound to refu&s;e. He, on the contrary, was now to bring
forward to their Lord&s;hips a Ma&s;s of Evidence, as full, as
&s;trong, as competent, and as conclu&s;ive, as ever e&s;tabli&s;hed
the guilt of a criminal, or ever brought conviction home to
the brea&s;ts of con&s;cientious Judges. In the performance of
this ta&s;k, he ob&s;erved, he &s;hould have the le&s;s difficulty, as
<PB N="8" REF="7">
their Lord&s;hips had attended to the whole, voluminous and
complicated as it appeared, with a diligence which did
honor to their feelings, and &s;hewed their individual &s;en&s;e of
the dignity of that high Tribunal, which they collectively
formed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this Evidence, to which he &s;hould call
the attention of the Court, was the Defences delivered in
by Mr. Ha&s;tings to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and to their
Lord&s;hips. On the&s;e, as being the voluntary admi&s;&s;ions of
the Pri&s;oner, unextorted by any threat, and unbia&s;&s;ed by
any per&s;ua&s;ion, much &s;tre&s;s had undoubtedly been laid. To
a part of the&s;e, however, an objection had been made, the
mo&s;t extraordinary, perhaps, that had ever been advanced in
a Court of Criminal Ju&s;tice:&mdash;an objection which, when
Mr. Ha&s;tings was well advi&s;ed, as he undoubtedly was&mdash;
when he was &s;aved from his own <HI>ra&s;h Guidance,</HI> the Ma|nagers
could &s;carcely have expected. This objection was,
that a Part of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Defence in particular, not having
been written by Mr. Ha&s;tings, but by &s;ome of his friends,
that Gentleman was not bound by any admi&s;&s;ions therein
contained. Mr. Ha&s;tings, on appearing at the Bar of the
Hou&s;e of Commons, had pleaded the ha&s;te in which he had
written, in palliation of his inaccuracies; he had even made
a merit of doing that him&s;elf, which would be le&s;s dangerous
if he had committed it to another!&mdash;But now, &s;aid Mr.
Sheridan, that he finds that there is &s;omething more than
inaccuracy&mdash;&s;omething fraught with that actual danger
which he had apprehended&mdash;he reverts to that plea which he
had abandoned, and declares that he had committed the
tru&s;t to others!&mdash;He di&s;claims all his former merits, and
avers that, in making up his tale, he had not tru&s;ted &s;olely
to his own powers,&mdash;that he had put his <HI>Memory</HI> into <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ion,</HI>
and <HI>parcelled</HI> out his <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> into different depart|ments.
The &s;tructure, it appeared, went on, whil&s;t Mr.
Ha&s;tings was content with over&s;eeing and cheering his La|bourers.
&mdash;"Mr. Shore, &s;aid he, you will take care to make
<PB N="9" REF="8">
me appear a good <HI>Financier</HI>! Major Scott, my <HI>Judgment</HI> is
repo&s;ed in your hands! Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> my HUMANITY is
your's!!!&mdash;The work being thus done, Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;ur|veyed
it with a carele&s;s glance, and adopted it as his own.
But now that its defects appear, the Child of his Adoption
becomes the object of his aver&s;ion, his approbation cea&s;es,
and his language is totally changed.&mdash;The Defence is, in
general, made up of general denials of the Charges, inter|mixed
with encomiums on his own conduct; yet Mr. Ha&s;tings
exclaims, "Subject me to all the other evidence again&s;t me;
&mdash;I know I can tru&s;t to their want of Recollection, and their
force of Attachment.&mdash;Bare my bo&s;om to every &s;haft of En|mity,
but &s;ave me from the <HI>Perils</HI> of my own <HI>Panegyric!</HI>"&mdash;
The <HI>ha&s;te</HI> in which the&s;e productions were written, was al&s;o
alledged by Mr. Ha&s;tings as an apology for every error; but
did it follow, that, becau&s;e a man wrote rapidly, he &s;hould
al&s;o write fal&s;ely? or was it, that the truth and candour of
Mr. Ha&s;tings were &s;o deeply buried in his bo&s;om, that long
&s;tudy alone could bring them upwards, whil&s;t the natural
fal&s;hood, floating on the &s;urface, could be transferred with
extemporaneous readine&s;s to every topic, whether to be
written, or to be uttered?&mdash;The&s;e were the apologies offered
for the variations, the admi&s;&s;ions, and the incon&s;i&s;tency, of
Mr. Ha&s;tings's Defences; but the&s;e, it was to be hoped, for
the &s;ake of propriety and good &s;en&s;e, would never again be
repeated.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, on quitting this &s;ubject, entered into a very
full and happy delineation of the &s;ituation of the Prince&s;&s;es
of <HI>Oude.</HI> No peru&s;al of the Turki&s;h Hi&s;tory, he ob&s;erved,
nor attention to the precepts of the Mahometan religion, could
give their Lord&s;hips any idea of the manners of the women
of high <HI>ca&s;ts</HI> in Hindo&s;tan. Educated in a profound re&s;pect
to the cu&s;toms of their Per&s;ian ance&s;tors, they maintained a
purer &s;tyle of Prejudice, and a loftier degree of Super&s;tition;
dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their Zenanas,
the Simplicity of their &s;entiments was equalled only by the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Purity of their conduct. In tho&s;e innocent retreats, they
were circum&s;cribed, not immured; for &s;uch was the force of
Prejudice, that Liberty would be looked on as a cur&s;e to
tho&s;e, to whom the common gaze of men would be regarded
as an unexpiable violation. However mi&s;taken their ideas,
they were placed there by the hand of Piety, and could not
be di&s;turbed but by a &s;acrilege. They were as Relics on an
altar, which, though depo&s;ited by Super&s;tition, none but the
impious would di&s;turb.</P>
<P>In addition to tho&s;e claims, Mr. Ha&s;tings him&s;elf had
borne te&s;timony to the Duty which Children owed to Parents
in Hindo&s;tan: yet the Bhow Begum, or mother of the
reigning Nabob, had &s;till &s;tronger demands on the affection
of her &s;on.&mdash;In the year 1764, when <HI>Sujah Dowlah,</HI> after
the battle of Buxar, was driven from that territory by the
Engli&s;h&mdash;which their politic Genero&s;ity afterwards re&s;tored&mdash;
&s;he bore her private trea&s;ures to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was re|warded
by the re&s;pectful attachment of his future life, with
the devi&s;e of all his territories to her &s;on. she had al&s;o
interfered in a quarrel between her &s;on and her hu&s;band,
and, when the &s;avage father was about to &s;trike down his
&s;on with a &s;abre, at the expence of her blood, pre&s;erved
that life which &s;he gave.&mdash;The&s;e were pleas in her favor,
which would have exacted the reverence of any man&mdash;<HI>but
one!</HI> But the&s;e pleas, the &s;ex, the age, and character of
the Begums; and what was yet more, the death-bed recom|mendation
of Sujah Dowlah, were all of no weight with
Mr. Ha&s;tings. This was therefore the object of the pre&s;ent
charge;&mdash;that where he owed protection, he had been the
&s;evere&s;t oppre&s;&s;or; that the weakne&s;s which &s;hould have
claimed his aid, but excited his violence; that he had &s;ub|jected
the &s;on thus, to make him the ungracious in&s;trument
of his tyranny over the parent, and had fir&s;t made him a <HI>&s;lave,</HI>
in order that he might become&mdash;a <HI>mon&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>The interference of Mr. <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> in 1775, in the diffe|rences
between the Begums and the Nabob, in con&s;equence
<PB N="11" REF="10">
of the claims of the latter, was the next ground of Mr.
SHERIDAN'S ob&s;ervations.&mdash;Mr. Bri&s;tow had then, in a con|ver&s;ation
with the &s;uperior or elder Begum, thrown out an
in&s;inuation, that the trea&s;ures which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were the
trea&s;ures of the State,&mdash;and on this in&s;inuation, &s;o termed
by Mr. Bri&s;tow him&s;elf, had Mr. Ha&s;tings founded all his
arguments on that head, and on which he lately appeared to
place &s;o much reliance.&mdash;The Begums at that time gave up
to the <HI>A&s;oph ul Dowla</HI> &s;ums amounting to five hundred and
fifty thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;Of this a part was to be paid in
goods, which as they con&s;i&s;ted of arms, elephants, &amp;c. the
Nabob alledged to be his property, and refu&s;ed to accept as
payment. This occa&s;ioned a di&s;pute which was referred to
the Board of <HI>Calcutta.</HI> Mr. Ha&s;tings then vindicated the
right of the Begums to all the goods in the Zenana, and
brought over the majority of the Council to his opinion.
The ideas then placed on record, he had &s;ince found it con|venient
to di&s;own, as belonging not to him, but to the majo|rity
of the Council!&mdash;How the&s;e opinions could be trans|ferred,
it might be difficult for their Lord&s;hips, though well
informed of the effects of <HI>Majorities</HI> and <HI>Minorities,</HI> to deter|mine.
As well might Mr. BURKE, on a future day deliver
an encomium on that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> man, Mr. <HI>Ha&s;tings!</HI> and
if reminded of his &s;hare in the pro&s;ecution, alledge, that he
was not accountable for &s;o <HI>nefarious</HI> a proceeding; that his
opinions when once delivered, were no longer his own; that
at the time, he had con&s;tantly acted in a <HI>Minority.</HI></P>
<P>The claims, however, it was ob&s;ervable, of the Nabob,
as to the trea&s;ure of the Begums, were at this time the only
plea alledged for the &s;eizure. The&s;e were always founded
on a pa&s;&s;age of that <HI>Koran</HI> which was perpetually quoted,
but never proved.&mdash;Not a word was then mentioned of the
&s;trange rebellion which was afterwards conjured up, and of
which the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> and the <HI>notoriety</HI> were equally a &s;ecret.&mdash;
A di&s;affection which was at its height, at the very time when
the Begums were di&s;pen&s;ing their liberality to the Nabob,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
and exerci&s;ing the greate&s;t genero&s;ity to the Engli&s;h Officers
in di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;a di&s;turbance, in &s;hort, without its parallel in
hi&s;tory, which was rai&s;ed by two <HI>Women,</HI>&mdash;carried on by two
<HI>Eunuchs,</HI>&mdash;and finally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by an <HI>Affidavit!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then adverted to the negociations of Mr.
Middleton with the Begums in 1778, when the di&s;contents
of the &s;uperior Begum would have induced her to leave the
country, unle&s;s her authority was &s;anctioned, and her pro|perty
&s;ecured by the Guarantee of the Company.&mdash;This
Guarantee, the Council, or Mr. Ha&s;tings, had thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to deny, as knowing that if the agreements with
the Elder Begum were proved, it would affix to Mr. Ha&s;t|ings
the guilt of all the &s;ufferings of the Women of the
Khord Mahal, the revenues for who&s;e &s;upport were &s;ecured
by the &s;ame engagement. In treating this part of the &s;ub|ject,
the principal difficulty aro&s;e from the <HI>uncertain</HI> evidence
of Mr. Middleton, who though concerned in the negociation
of <HI>four</HI> treaties, could not recollect affixing his &s;ignature
to <HI>three</HI> out of that number. Mr. Sheridan proved, how|ever,
from the evidence even of Mr. Middleton, that a
Treaty had been &s;igned in October, 1778, wherein the rights
of the Elder Begum were fully recognized; a provi&s;ion
&s;ecured for the Women and Children of the late Vizier in
the Khord Mahal; and that tho&s;e engagements had received
the fulle&s;t &s;anction of Mr. Ha&s;tings. The&s;e facts were con|firmed
by the evidence of Mr. Purling, a gentleman, who,
Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, had delivered him&s;elf fairly, and as
having no <HI>foul &s;ecrets</HI> to conceal. He had tran&s;mitted copies
of the&s;e engagements in 1780 to Mr. Ha&s;tings at Calcutta;
the an&s;wer returned was, that in arranging the taxes on the
other di&s;tricts, he &s;hould pa&s;s over the Jaghires of the Be|gums.
No notice was then taken of any impropriety in the
tran&s;actions in 1778, nor any notice given of an intended
revocation of tho&s;e engagements.</P>
<P>But in June 1781, when General Clavering, and Colonel
Mon&s;on, being no more, and Mr. Francis having returned
<PB N="13" REF="12">
to Europe, all the <HI>hoard</HI> and <HI>arrear</HI> of collected evil bur&s;t
forth without re&s;traint, and Mr. Ha&s;tings determined on his
Journey to the Upper Provinces;&mdash;it was then that, without
adverting to intermediate tran&s;actions, he met with the Na|bob
A&s;oph ul Dowlah, at Chunar, and received from him
the my&s;terious pre&s;ent of 100,000l.&mdash;To form a proper idea
of this tran&s;action, it was only nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the re|&s;pective
&s;ituation of him who gave, and him who received,
this pre&s;ent.&mdash;It was not given by the Nabob from the &s;uper|flux
of his wealth, nor in the abundance of his e&s;teem for
the man to whom it was given: it was, on the contrary, a
prodigal bounty, drawn from a country depopulated,&mdash;no
matter whether by natural cau&s;es, or by the grinding of
Oppre&s;&s;ion. It was rai&s;ed by an exaction, which took what
Calamity had &s;pared, and Rapine overlooked;&mdash;and pur&s;ued
tho&s;e angry di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, when a <HI>prophetic</HI>
cha&s;ti&s;ement had been inflicted on a <HI>fated</HI> realm.&mdash;The &s;e|crecy
which had marked this tran&s;action, was not the &s;malle&s;t
proof of its criminality. When <HI>Benaram Pundit</HI> had, a
&s;hort time before, made a pre&s;ent to the Company of a lack
of rupees, Mr. Ha&s;tings, in his own language, deemed it
"worthy the prai&s;e of being recorded." But in this in|&s;tance,
when ten times that &s;um was given, neither Mr.
Middleton nor the Council were acquainted with the tran&s;|action,
until Mr. Ha&s;tings, four months after, felt him&s;elf
compelled to write an account to England, and the intelli|gence
returned thus circuitou&s;ly to his friends in India!&mdash;It
was peculiarly ob&s;ervable in this tran&s;action, how much the
<HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> of the different parties were at variance. Mr.
Ha&s;tings travels to the Nabob, to &s;ee, no doubt, and enquire
into his <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> but immediately takes from him 130,000l.
to be applied to the nece&s;&s;ities of the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> Ea&s;t-India
Company. But, on farther deliberation, the&s;e con&s;idera|tions
vani&s;h: a <HI>third</HI> object ari&s;es, more worthy than either
of the former, and the money is taken from the one, and
<PB N="14" REF="13">
demanded from the other, to be applied to the u&s;e of&mdash;the
<HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> Mr. Ha&s;tings.</P>
<P>The money, it was alledged by Mr. Ha&s;tings, had been
originally taken to di&s;charge the Arrear of the Army. It
had not been applied to that u&s;e, becau&s;e it was received in
bills on Gopal Dos, a rich Banker, of Benares, who was
then kept a pri&s;oner by Cheit Sing.&mdash;Major Scott being
que&s;tioned on the &s;ubject, declared, that bills on Gopal Dos
were as good as ca&s;h; for that, though the principal of the
hou&s;e was a pri&s;oner, that circum&s;tance made no difference
what&s;oever with the other partners. Thus Mr. Ha&s;tings was
incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, by alledging an objection which
&s;hould have prevented his taking the money, in the fir&s;t
in&s;tance, for the purpo&s;e he had &s;tated; and Major Scott
contradicting Mr. Ha&s;tings, removed the objection, and
re&s;tored the bu&s;ine&s;s to its original footing.&mdash;But, through
all tho&s;e windings of my&s;terious Hypocri&s;y, and of artificial
Concealment, it was ea&s;y to mark the &s;en&s;e of hidden Guilt.
Mr. Ha&s;tings him&s;elf, being driven from every other hold,
advanced the &s;tale plea of <HI>State Nece&s;&s;ity:</HI> but of this nece&s;&s;ity
he had brought no proof; it was a nece&s;&s;ity which li&s;tened to
whi&s;pers, for the purpo&s;e of crimination, and dealt in ru|mour
to prove its own exi&s;tence.&mdash;To a General leading the
armies of Britain; to an Admiral bearing her thunders over
the &s;eas,&mdash;the plea of Nece&s;&s;ity might be indulged, if the
wants of tho&s;e were to be &s;upplied who&s;e blood had been
&s;pilt in the &s;ervice of their country; but then, like the im|perial
eagle de&s;cending from its ne&s;t, though it de&s;olated
the &s;kirts of the rock, the Motive and the Conduct would be
equally con&s;picuous. No concealment would then be nece&s;|&s;ary,
and they would di&s;dain the veil which covered the dark
mean arts of bu&s;y Peculation.</P>
<P>On the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Treaty of Chunar, which &s;ucceeded
the acceptance of this bribe, Mr. Sheridan was equally per|&s;picuous
and equally &s;evere. It was a proceeding, he ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
which, as it had its beginning in Corruption, had
its continuance in Fraud, and its end in Violence. The fir&s;t
propo&s;ition of the Nabob after his recent liberality, was,
that the army &s;hould be removed, and all the Engli&s;h re|called
from his dominions. The Bribe which he had given
was the obvious price of their removal. He felt the weight
of their oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;he knew, to &s;peak his own language,
"that, when the Engli&s;h &s;taid, they &s;taid to a&s;k for &s;ome|thing."
Though their predece&s;&s;ors had exhau&s;ted the reve|nue
&mdash;though they had &s;haken the tree until nothing remained
upon its <HI>leafle&s;s</HI> branches, yet a new flight was on the wing
to watch the fir&s;t <HI>buddings</HI> of its pro&s;perity, and to nip every
promi&s;e of future luxuriance.</P>
<P>To this demand Mr. Ha&s;tings had promi&s;ed to accede,
and to recal every Engli&s;hman from the province; but by an
eva&s;ion, which Mr. Middleton di&s;clo&s;ed with &s;o much diffi|culty
to their Lord&s;hips, on the la&s;t day of his appearance,
the promi&s;e was virtually recalled. No <HI>orders</HI> were afterwards
given for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Engli&s;hmen in the province,
but <HI>recommendations</HI> of the &s;ame effect, with Mr. Middleton
and the Vizier, were &s;ent, and the practice continued.&mdash;In
the agreement re&s;pecting the Refumption of the Jaghires,
the Nabob had been duped by a &s;imilar deception. He had
demanded and obtained leave to re&s;ume tho&s;e of certain indi|viduals:
Mr. Ha&s;tings, however, defeated the permi&s;&s;ion,
by making the order general; knowing that there were &s;ome
favourites of the Nabob whom he could be by no means
brought to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s.&mdash;Such was the conduct of Mr. Ha&s;tings,
not in the moment of cold or crafty policy, but in the hour
of confidence, and the efferve&s;cence of his gratitude for the
favour he had ju&s;t received. Soaring above every common
feeling, he could deceive the man to who&s;e liberality he
&s;tood indebted&mdash;even his <HI>Gratitude</HI> was <HI>perilous</HI>&mdash;and a <HI>danger</HI>
actually awaited on the return which he was to make to an
effu&s;ion of genero&s;ity!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
The tran&s;actions in which Sir <HI>Elijah Impey</HI> bore a &s;hare,
and the tenor of his evidence, were the next objects of Mr.
Sheridan's animadver&s;ion.&mdash;The late Chief Ju&s;tice of Bengal,
he remarked, had repeatedly &s;tated, that Mr. Ha&s;tings left
Calcutta with <HI>two</HI> Re&s;ources in his view,&mdash;tho&s;e of <HI>Benares</HI>
and of <HI>Oude.</HI> It appeared, however, from every circum|&s;tance,
that the latter re&s;ource was never in his contempla|tion,
until the in&s;urrections in Benar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">, terminating in the
capture of Bedjeygur, had de&s;troyed all his hopes in that
province. At that in&s;tant the min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of Mr. Ha&s;tings, fertile
in re&s;ources, fixed it&s;elf on the Trea&s;ures of the Begums,
and Sir Elijah Impey was di&s;patched to collect materials for
their crimination. "But I have ever thought," &s;aid Mr.
Sheridan, "the &s;election of &s;uch a per&s;onage, for &s;uch a
purpo&s;e, one of the greate&s;t aggravations of the guilt of
Mr. Ha&s;tings."&mdash;That he, the purity of who&s;e character
&s;hould have influenced his conduct, even in his mo&s;t dome&s;tic
retirements; that he, who, if con&s;ulting the dignity of
Briti&s;h Ju&s;tice, &s;hould have remained as &s;tationary as his
Court in Calcutta;&mdash;that &s;uch a man &s;hould be called to
travel <HI>Five Hundred</HI> miles, for the tran&s;action of &s;uch a bu|&s;ine&s;s,
was a deviation without a plea, and a degradation
without example.&mdash;This, however, was in &s;ome degree a
que&s;tion to be ab&s;tracted for the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who
adorned and illumined the &s;eats of Ju&s;tice in Britain, and
the purity of who&s;e character precluded the nece&s;&s;ity of any
further ob&s;ervations on &s;o different a conduct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the manner in which Sir Elijah Impey
had delivered his evidence, it required &s;ome ob&s;ervation,
though made without imputing to that gentleman the &s;malle&s;t
culpability. Sir Elijah had admitted, that in giving his
evidence he had never an&s;wered without looking equally to
the probability, and the con&s;equences of the fact in que&s;tion.
Sometimes he had even admitted circum&s;tances of which he
had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they
<PB N="17" REF="16">
had taken place. By con&s;ulting in this manner what was
<HI>probable,</HI> and the contrary, he might certainly have corrected
his memory at times, and Mr. Sheridan &s;aid he would
accept that mode of giving his te&s;timony, provided that the
inver&s;e of the propo&s;ition might al&s;o have place, and that
where a circum&s;tance was <HI>improbable,</HI> a &s;imilar degree of
credit might be &s;ubtracted from the te&s;timony of the witne&s;s.
<HI>Five</HI> times in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and <HI>twice</HI> in that
Court, for in&s;tance, had Sir Elijah Impey borne te&s;timony,
that a rebellion was raging at Fyzabad, at the time of his
journey to Lucknow. Yet on the <HI>eighth</HI> examination, he
had contradicted all the former, and declared, that what he
meant was that the rebellion <HI>had</HI> been raging, and the
country was then in &s;ome degree re&s;tored to quiet.&mdash;The
rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for the former errors were, that he had for|gotten
a letter received from Mr. Ha&s;tings, informing him
that the rebellion was quelled, and that he had al&s;o forgot|ten
his own propo&s;ition of travelling through Fyzabad to
Lucknow. With re&s;pect to the letter, nothing could be
&s;aid, as it was not in evidence; but the other ob&s;ervation
would &s;carcely be admitted, when it was recollected that in
the Hou&s;e of Commons Sir Elijah Impey had declared that
it was his propo&s;al to travel through Fyzabad, which had
originally brought forth the information that the way was
ob&s;tructed by the rebellion!&mdash;From this information Sir
Elijah Impey had gone by the way of Illyabad,&mdash;but what
was yet more &s;ingular, was, that on his return he would
again have returned by the way of Fyzabad, if he had not
been again informed of the danger;&mdash;&s;o that had it not been
for the&s;e friendly informations, the Chief Ju&s;tice would have
run plump into the very <HI>focus</HI> of the rebellion!&mdash;There were
two circum&s;tances, however, worthy of remark;&mdash;the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
was, that Sir <HI>Elijah Impey</HI> &s;hould, when charged with &s;o
dangerous a commi&s;&s;ion as that of procuring evidence, to
prove that the <HI>Begums</HI> had meditated the expul&s;ion of their
&s;on from the Throne, and of the Engli&s;h from Bengal,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;hould twice intend to pa&s;s through the city of their re&s;i|denc;
and that he, as he alledged, from mere motives of
&s;choolboy corio&s;ity, &s;hould choo&s;e the <HI>primro&s;e</HI> path&mdash;and
with, when engaged in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s, to loiter in the way,
and idle in the &s;un-&s;hine.&mdash;The &s;econd circum&s;tance worthy
of ob&s;ervation, was, that if a conclu&s;ion could be made
from a cloud of circum&s;tances, the inference on this occa&s;ion
would undoubtedly be, that Sir Elijah Impey was di&s;&s;uaded
by Mr. Ha&s;tings, and Mr. Middleton from pa&s;&s;ing by the
way of Fyzabad, as well knowing, that if, as a friend to
Mr. Ha&s;tings, he were to approach the Begums, he would
be convinced by his reception, that nothing could be more
foreign from the truth than the idea of their &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;af|fection.
&mdash;It was al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that Sir Elijah Impey, at
Lucknow, taking evidence in the face of day in &s;upport of
this charge of rebellion again&s;t the Begums, when conver&s;ing
with the Nabob and his Mini&s;ter, heard not a &s;ingle word
from either of a rebellion, by which it was propo&s;ed to de|throne
the Nabob, and to change the Government of his
dominions!&mdash;And equally unaccountable it appeared that
Sir Elijah Impey, who had advi&s;ed the taking of tho&s;e affi|davits
for the &s;afety of Mr. Ha&s;tings, had never read them
at the time, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing whether they were &s;uf|ficient
for the purpo&s;e, or the contrary!&mdash;After &s;o long a
re&s;erve, however, and after declaring on oath that he thought
it unnece&s;&s;ary, the next &s;tep taken by Sir Elijah Impey, was
to read the affidavits, as, however late, they might contribute
&s;omething to his information. He had been led to this
&s;tudy by his own allegation, from having been mi&s;ted by
Mr. SHERIDAN, one of the managers on the part of the
Commons, who by looking at a book which he held in his
hand, had per&s;uaded him to declare that a &s;worn interpreter
was pre&s;ent on the receiving of tho&s;e-affidavits; that Major
Davy was pre&s;ent for that purpo&s;e&mdash;and that whoever it was,
he was perfectly &s;atisfied with his conduct on the occa&s;ion;
when it was actually in evidence that no interpreter what&s;o|ever
<PB N="19" REF="18">
was pre&s;ent.&mdash;Now, &s;aid Mr. Sheridan, how I, by
merely looking into a book, could <HI>intimate</HI> the pre&s;ence of
an interpreter, could <HI>inculcate</HI> the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Major Davy,
and could al&s;o <HI>look</HI> the &s;atisfaction conceived by Sir Elijah
Impey, are que&s;tions which I believe that Gentleman alone
is able to determine!</P>
<P>He &s;hould admit, however, he &s;aid, that Sir Elijah Impey
had not &s;trictly attended to forms on the occa&s;ion of taking
tho&s;e affidavits; that he had merely directed the bible to be
given to the Whites, and the Koran to the Blacks, and had
packed up in his wallet the returns of both without any
further enquiry; or that he had glanced over them in India,
having previou&s;ly cut off all communication between his <HI>eye</HI>
and his <HI>mind,</HI> &s;o that no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s was transferred from
the former to the latter; and that he had read them in Eng|land,
if po&s;&s;ible, with le&s;s information:&mdash;however &s;trange
the&s;e circum&s;tances might be, he would admit them all;&mdash;
he would even admit, that the affidavits were legally and
properly taken&mdash;and yet would prove that tho&s;e affidavits
were not &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain any one point of criminality
again&s;t tho&s;e who were the &s;ubjects of the pre&s;ent Charge.</P>

<P>MR. SHERIDAN then re&s;umed his &s;peech, where he
had left off on Tue&s;day la&s;t, with a &s;hort preface
to the following effect:</P>
<P>In obedience to the commands of the Honourable Ma|nagers,
he &s;aid, he ro&s;e to continue the ob&s;ervations which
he had to make, in &s;umming up the evidence on the &s;econd
Charge again&s;t Warren Ha&s;tings, E&s;q.&mdash;In doing this, he
tru&s;ted it would be believed that he had been, and would
continue to be, mo&s;t guarded in quoting the evidence on
which he might have to animadvert, correctly and accurately,
and that for this purpo&s;e he had left off where he did, a part
of what he wi&s;hed to ob&s;erve on not being in the way. He
left off at the affidavits, and here it was that he meant to re|&s;ume
his &s;peech: he con&s;idered their Lord&s;hips as in fact
<PB N="22" REF="20">
employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d in trying the truth of the matter of tho&s;e affida|vits,
and the allegations therein contained, upon which he
would have no objection to re&s;t the whole truth of the charge
brought again&s;t the pri&s;oner. It was in this view, and for
this purpo&s;e, that he wi&s;hed to take up &s;ome part of their
Lord&s;hips time; but, before he entered into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of
the affidavits, there were two or three matters on which he
was de&s;irous of &s;aying a few words. In the out&s;et of this
bu&s;ine&s;s, it had been held forth as an allegation on the part
of the pri&s;oner at the bar, and as an excu&s;e of the atrocious
proceeding again&s;t the Begums, that they had been guilty
of various acts of ho&s;tility, as well as of a wi&s;h to dethrone
the Nabob; and it was a&s;&s;orted that the affidavits taken at
Lucknow all tended to prove the&s;e facts. Of the fir&s;t of
the&s;e two allegations, he challenged the Coun&s;el for the pri|&s;oner
to produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance drawn from tho&s;e affidavits.
There was not a &s;ingle in&s;tance,&mdash;nay, the allegation was
even abandoned by them&s;elves;&mdash;a pretty &s;trong proof that
it had been taken up lightly. When a charge con&s;i&s;ted of
two parts, and one of them was abandoned, it was very na|tural
for a man to di&s;tru&s;t the other. It certainly was not a
proof that the other was fal&s;e al&s;o, nor did he mean to a&s;&s;ume
any &s;uch argument; he &s;aid only, that it would influence the
mind &s;o far as to make it curious and particular in the en|quiry,
and to make it at lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t the truth of the other
branch of the charge al&s;o. But their Lord&s;hips, in this par|ticular
ca&s;e, would have additional rea&s;on for jealou&s;y and
di&s;tru&s;t: they would recollect from whom the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions and
charges again&s;t the Begums came, and by whom they were
made: they were made by Mr. Ha&s;tings, who went forth
from Calcutta in the year 1781, for the avowed purpo&s;e of
collecting a large &s;um of money, and who acknowledged
that he had but two re&s;ources. Here then we had, in the
&s;ame per&s;on, the accu&s;er and the judge&mdash;nay more, we had
a judge corruptly intere&s;ted in the accu&s;ation he was to
make, and who intended to draw a profit, and reap an ad|vantage,
<PB N="23" REF="21">
from deciding on the accu&s;ation which he him&s;elf
made. He would not take up their Lord&s;hips time, in &s;ay|inga
word on the gro&s;s turpitude of &s;uch a double character,
nor on the frontle&s;s di&s;regard of all the feelings which ought
to actuate the human heart, in thus mixing characters that
ought never to be joined. What did he de&s;ire from all this?
Only that an accu&s;ation, made under &s;uch circum&s;tances,
&s;hould not meet with implicit belief, and that their Lord|&s;hips,
remembering that it was &s;o made, would accompany
him through the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the affidavits, free and unin|fluenced
by tho&s;e prefatory and general a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>The next matter that he was anxious to pro&s;s on their
con&s;ideration, previous to his taking up the affidavits, was
the infinite improbability of &s;uch an intention being true,
from the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of executing the de&s;ign. E&s;ti|mating
the power of the Begums at the mo&s;t &s;anguine &s;tand|ard,
it could not evidently be in their reach to accompli&s;h
any overthrow, deci&s;ive or momentary, of the Nabob, much
le&s;s of the Engli&s;h. He was not, however, &s;o weak as to
a&s;&s;ert a doctrine, that becau&s;e a thing was improbable, it
was not therefore attempted; or that, becau&s;e they had no
intere&s;t in the accompli&s;hment of the object, they there|fore
did not undertake it. He could not look to Mr.
Ha&s;tings without knowing, and being forced to acknowledge,
that there were people with &s;uch a perver&s;e turn of mind as
to pro&s;ecute mi&s;chief without intere&s;t; and that there were
pa&s;&s;ions in the human &s;oul, which lead to turpitude without
a motive.</P>
<P>He now came to the con&s;ideration of the affidavits&mdash;that
ma&s;s of legal evidence on which the pri&s;oner meant to re&s;t
his defence, and which he con&s;idered of &s;o much con&s;equence
to his acquittal on this charge. He had &s;aid, that when the
Honourable Mover of the Impeachment came to this charge,
he treated the affidavits in his peculiar manner, and loaded
them with terms of opprobrious reproach. What the pecu|liar
manner of his Honourable Friend was, as hinted in this
<PB N="24" REF="22">
manner, he could not tell; but he, for his own part, would
&s;ay, that if they were treated otherways than with di&s;dain,
they had not their de&s;ert. It was a&s;&s;erted, that they were
taken in the de&s;ire of procuring the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible evidence of
the &s;tate of the country, and of the circum&s;tances of the
in&s;urrection. This was a direct fal&s;hood;&mdash;they were taken
for no other purpo&s;e but that of ju&s;tifying Mr. Ha&s;tings in
his plunder of the Begums; that no other intention was in
the minds of any of the per&s;ons concerned, and that the
de&s;ign was not formed, until, by the failure of one of his
re&s;ources, this only remained for the plunderer.</P>
<P>He left off with the crippled te&s;timony of his friend Dewen
Sing. Here then he began, and he entered into a minute
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the affidavits, reading, comparing, and
commenting on the pa&s;&s;ages. To enumerate all the&s;e would
require much &s;pace; nor, unle&s;s the reader was well ac|quainted
with all the facts, would it be po&s;&s;ible for us to
make him ta&s;te and feel the &s;trength of Mr. Sheridan's rea|&s;oning,
which was as clo&s;e, connected, and convincing, as
any &s;peech we ever heard on any occa&s;ion. He particularly
animadverted on the affidavits of Hyder Beg Cawn, who,
though the Mini&s;ter of the Nabob, and the man of all others
the be&s;t acquainted with the tran&s;actions then pa&s;&s;ing in the
country, did not &s;ay one &s;yllable on the &s;ubject of the pre|tended
rebellion, nor hint any thing of the kind; and this,
though the affidavit was made in November, 1781, and the
rebellion was pretended to have been at lea&s;t previous to that
time:&mdash;on that of Mr. Middleton, which al&s;o was taken on
the 27th of November, and that after he knew the plea&s;ure
of Mr. Ha&s;tings as to the plunder of the Begums. The
only pa&s;&s;age which his affidavit contained re&s;pecting the in|&s;urrection,
was, that he had heard from rumour that they
had given much encouragement, and &s;ome aid, to the Jag|hiredars,
in re&s;i&s;ting the re&s;umption; and that he heard
there had been a good di&s;po&s;ition in them towards the Rajah
Cheit Sing. The whole of his evidence went on mere hear|&s;ay
<PB N="25" REF="23">
and rumour, and it amounted to much encouragemet
and &s;ome aid&mdash;on which circum&s;tance it was that he made
up his con&s;cience to the plunder, and probably to the de|&s;truction
of the ladies. He knew nothing of it him&s;elf,
though he was the Re&s;ident. He &s;aw no in&s;urrection; he
met with no indi&s;po&s;itions; he knew nothing of it him&s;elf,
but he had heard that they had encouraged the Jaghiredars
to re&s;i&s;t, and on this, and no more, was this con&s;cientious
&s;ervant of Mr. Ha&s;tings ready to execute any &s;cheme of
plunder that he &s;hould devi&s;e.&mdash;The Hon. Manager al&s;o
particularly adverted to the affidavit of Major M 'Donald, of
Captain Gordon, and of a Frenchman, who&s;e depo&s;ition was
quite in the French &s;tyle, magnificent and glittering: it
talked of his having penetrated the de&s;arts&mdash;of his having
&s;een tygers&mdash;of his having kept the be&s;t company&mdash;and
heard a va&s;t number of important rumours, but not one
word about the rebellion of the Begums.&mdash;He went through
the affidavits of Colonel Hannay, and, among others, to
that &s;tating that three Zemindars, on the 31&s;t of December,
had &s;aid, that they were credibly informed that there was a
de&s;ign in the Begums again&s;t the Nabob. But the&s;e con&s;ci|entious
Serjeants would not &s;uffer their names to be men|tioned:
all the reward that they expected was to be con|cealed
&mdash;although they were thus rendering &s;ervice to their
Sovereign, and that that Sovereign was now in entire po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of power, and free from all po&s;&s;ible effects of any me|ditated
ho&s;tility from the quarter alledged to have de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated the contents of the &s;everal affidavits, he
&s;aid, he knew that in a Court of Law, if the trial were de|pending
merely on the truth and validity of the&s;e affidavits,
he &s;hould be &s;topt, if he attempted to begin any an&s;wer to,
and ob&s;ervation upon them. He &s;hould be told from the
Bench&mdash;What do you mean to an&s;wer? There is nothing
contained in the&s;e affidavits upon which we can &s;uffer you to
take up the time of the Court one minute. There is not,
from the beginning to the end, one particle of legal, &s;ub|&s;tantial,
<PB N="26" REF="24">
or even a defen&s;ible proof. Nothing but hear&s;ay
and rumour. Such he knew would be the admonition
which he &s;hould receive in any Court of Law; but meaning
and wi&s;hing to meet every thing at their Lord&s;hip's bar, on
which the pri&s;oner could build the &s;malle&s;t degree of depend|ance,
it was his wi&s;h to examine &s;eparately the points which
it was the aim of the pri&s;oner to &s;et up by the&s;e affidavits.
They were three in number, and he &s;hould treat of each
&s;ingly.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Begums gave a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Rajah Cheyt
Sing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they encouraged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Jaghiredars to
re&s;i&s;t the re&s;umptions of the Jaghires.</ITEM>
<ITEM>And, 3. That they were the principal movers of all the
commotions in Oude.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e were the three allegations, which it was meant to
in&s;inuate the&s;e affidavits contained&mdash;and all the&s;e were ac|companied
with a general charge, that the Begums were in
rebellion. He declared, that in regard to the la&s;t in&s;inua|tion,
he had &s;earched with all the indefatigable indu&s;try of
an antiquary, hunting for a precious ve&s;tige that was to
decide &s;ome important point in hi&s;tory, for this rebellion.&mdash;
But of this rebellion, which in the mouth of Mr. Ha&s;tings
was &s;poken of with as much certainty as that of 1745 was
mentioned in England, no trace nor appearance could he
find.&mdash;He could neither find the place where it raged, nor
time when. No battle had been fought&mdash;no army had
marched&mdash;no blood had been &s;pilt&mdash;not one &s;ingle thing had
happened, by which any one creature in the country where
it was &s;aid to happen could po&s;&s;ibly have di&s;covered that a
rebellion was there. It was a rebellion that never &s;truck a
blow, and that never was &s;truck.&mdash;It was a rebellion, the
object of which was unnatural, but which died a natural
death. If rebellions of &s;uch a kind could be, there was no
&s;aying where a rebellion might not exi&s;t. Perhaps, at the
very moment that he was &s;peaking, there might be a rebel|lion
<PB N="27" REF="25">
raging in the heart of London. Perhaps it might be at
this moment lying perdue in &s;ome of the adjacent villages;
or like the o&s;tentatious encampment that had given celebrity
to Brentford and Ealing, it might have taken up its head
quarters at Hammer&s;mith, or I&s;tington, ready to pour down
its violence on the approach of night. He was very eager
to a&s;certain the time of this horrid rebellion. There was
nothing &s;o clear and manife&s;t as this fact&mdash;that there was
none in the beginning of Augu&s;t 1781. On the 29th of
that month there were confidential letters from Col. Morgan
the commanding officer, and there was not one &s;yllable in
the&s;e letters of any &s;uch thing. He afterwards detache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> troops
from Cawn Poote; and on the 27th of September he
gives an account of &s;ome in&s;urrection at Lucknow; but of
none at Fyzabad, nor of any thing like it. There was a
letter from Major Hannay, then at the Rajah's Court, dated
the 10th of September, in which there is an account of the
&s;tate of the Rajah's affairs; but not one &s;yllable of any de|&s;ign
of his being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Begums. There was after
this a letter from the &s;ame Court, communicating the re|fources
of the Rajah. In this letter he was advi&s;ed to apply
to the Nabob him&s;elf, from whom there was a probability of
his receiving &s;uccour; but not to apply to Hyder Beg, who
was &s;tated to be intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h. During all
this time, therefore, there was no rebellion. The Nabob
went to &s;ee his mother, the very lady who was &s;aid to have
ri&s;en in rebellion again&s;t him. But Mr. Middleton &s;tated,
that he was accompanied by 2000 hor&s;e, having no martial
memory on common occa&s;ions. Mr. Middleton could exactly
tell that the&s;e troops kept pace with the Nabob, who tra|velled
very fa&s;t, &s;o much &s;o that he could hardly keep up
with him; but the Nabob having, according to Mr. Mid|dleton,
taken 2000 hor&s;e with him, he ob&s;erved the Coun|&s;el
&s;eized on the 2000 hor&s;e, and certainly meant to a&s;&s;ert
that the&s;e 2000 hor&s;e were taken for no other purpo&s;e than
to quell the in&s;urrection; unfortunately, however, for the
<PB N="28" REF="26">
martial memory of Mr. Middleton, Captain Edwards, who
was rather more of a military man, and who&s;e duty it was to
accompany the Nabob, &s;tated that he had but five or &s;ix
hundred hor&s;e, and tho&s;e &s;o mi&s;erably equipped, and &s;o bad
that they were not able to keep up with him, and but a few
indeed were near his per&s;on, or within the reach of any com|mand,
&s;o as to be applied to any &s;ervice; for of the&s;e few,
the mo&s;t were di&s;affected and mutinous from being ill paid;
&s;o that the hor&s;e that he had with him were rather di&s;po&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t than to quell any in&s;urrections. Still more unfortu|nately,
the memory of Mr. Middleton had unexpectedly
cleared up, and informed the Court that it was a con&s;tant
thing for the Princes of India to travel with a great equi|page,
and that it was con&s;idered as a di&s;re&s;pect to the per&s;on
whom they vi&s;ited, to come unattended. But the Coun&s;el
&s;hould have the whole of the hor&s;e, camels, elephants, and
all, and they &s;hould all gallop as fa&s;t as they might plea&s;e to
wi&s;h.&mdash;What did they mean, or wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h from this
fact? It never was their intention to in&s;inuate that the Na|bob
went to pay his re&s;pects to his mother unattended by his
retinue. He could not mean to go <HI>incog.</HI> unle&s;s he wi&s;hed
to keep pace with the rebellion.&mdash;That hearing of a rebellion
of two old women without an army, he thought that it
&s;hould be quelled by a Prince in di&s;gui&s;e, without his
guards. They did not mean to &s;ay that the Indian Princes
travelled like the Princes of Europe, who &s;ometimes from
one motive, and &s;ometimes from another&mdash;at times from
political views, and at times from curio&s;ity&mdash;travelling &s;ome
to France to learn manners, others to England to learn
liberty&mdash;cho&s;e to be relieved from the pomps of &s;tate, and
from the drudgery of equipage.&mdash;It was not &s;o in India&mdash;
where the manners required o&s;tentation, and where it would
be con&s;idered as an in&s;ult for one Prince to vi&s;it another
without maintaining his &s;tate.</P>
<P>He then, as he &s;aid, would put to the route a thou&s;and
audges, who were &s;aid to be di&s;patched by the Begums, for
<PB N="29" REF="27">
the purpo&s;e of promoting an in&s;urrection. He detected all
the contradictory accounts that had been given of the&s;e
matchlock-men, and having &s;hewn the complete fallacy at|tempted
to be impo&s;ed on the credulity of the world in this
in&s;tance, he a&s;ked why the younger &s;on of the Bhow Begum
had not been &s;u&s;pected of having any concern or intere&s;t in
this rebellion? This particularly had been very thoroughly
explained. Sir Elijah Impey had been a&s;ked whether this
Prince had any wealth?&mdash;No, none&mdash;he was mi&s;erably poor,
and was a pen&s;ioner&mdash;there was the &s;olution of the difficulty.
There never was in the mind of Mr. Ha&s;tings a &s;u&s;picion
of <HI>trea&s;on</HI> where there was not <HI>trea&s;ure.</HI> Penury was a com|plete
and &s;atisfactory proof that he could not be di&s;affected&mdash;
opulence on the contrary was a manife&s;t indication of di&s;loy|alty.
Mr. Ha&s;tings, in his political &s;agacity, took the con|ver&s;e
of the doctrine that the experience of hi&s;tory had
e&s;tabli&s;hed; that opulence and wealth, as they attached a
man to the country where they lay, made him cautious and
circum&s;pect how he hazarded any enterprize that might
draw on him&s;elf the jealou&s;y of Government. Poverty on
the other hand made a man giddy and de&s;perate; having no
permanent &s;take, he was ea&s;ily &s;educed into commotion.
Mr. Ha&s;tings, on the contrary, never failed to find a con|vincing
and &s;elf-evident proof of attachment in penury, and
an unan&s;werable evidence of rebellion in wealth.</P>
<P>In enumerating the various &s;trong in&s;tances of the &s;teady
friend&s;hip and good di&s;po&s;ition of the Begums to the Engli&s;h
intere&s;ts, Mr. Sheridan particularly animadverted on the
repre&s;entation they had made in favour of Captain&mdash;,
who&s;e life they had &s;aved at the very moment when, if they
had meant to &s;trike any blow again&s;t the Engli&s;h intere&s;ts,
the blow would have been felt.&mdash;This gentleman, who&s;e
life the Bhow Begum had &s;aved, and who in the fir&s;t and
natural feelings of the &s;oul, had repeatedly poured forth his
grateful acknowledgements of the obligation, had afterwards
been made the in&s;trument of the de&s;truction of his faviour.
<PB N="30" REF="28">
It had been a&s;ked why the Managers had not called Captain
&mdash;to the bar.&mdash;Why call him to the bar!&mdash;He never
hoped to &s;ee him at the bar till he came there with fervent
contrition and penitentiary zeal, to make atonement to the
Prince&s;s, who was to him his &s;econd creator, and whom,
with the breath of life, the gift of the Begum, he had
accu&s;ed; and in the pre&s;ence of their common God; had
&s;olemnly poured forth a part of that breath in an affidavit,
by which her ruin was to be accompli&s;hed! He would not
believe it po&s;&s;ible, that after having repeatedly acknowledged
that he owed his life and liberty to the beneficent hand of
this Lady, he could &s;o far forget all that he owed, as of his
own mere motion to come forward and make this affidavit.
His knowledge of human feelings would not permit him to
believe that it could be po&s;&s;ible for any human creature to be
guilty of an act &s;o atrocious.&mdash;He mu&s;t imagine that the
Gentleman had been deluded and impo&s;ed upon&mdash;that he
had been fal&s;ely and &s;candalou&s;ly deceived&mdash;and that at the
moment when he made that affidavit, he was ignorant of the
u&s;e to which it was to be applied.&mdash;He hoped, and tru&s;ted,
that &s;eeing that he was made the in&s;trument of the ruin, and
overthrow of his benefactre&s;s, he would come forward and
&s;tate the impo&s;ition that had been practi&s;ed upon him&mdash;for
he could not be per&s;uaded that any human creature could be
capable of &s;tanding up in the pre&s;ence of God, and exclaim|ing
&mdash;To this woman I owe my life, and my gratitude &s;hall
be her de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan continued in a &s;train of eloquence more
lofty and commanding than any thing we ever heard, to
&s;tate the circum&s;tance of the book, the leaves of which were
torn out, and which was mutilated for the purpo&s;e of con|cealment.
After &s;tating all the circum&s;tances of this fact,
and the manner in which the fact had been accounted for,
he called it a black perjury.&mdash;Then ri&s;ing in his eloquence
to a flight beyond our power to trace him, he &s;aid, that
the&s;e letters, though thus torn and mangled, were brought
<PB N="31" REF="29">
light.&mdash;That power which gives to the arms of infant inno|cence
the &s;trength of Hercules&mdash;which controuls the mighty,
and aba&s;hes the confident&mdash;which gives to truth per&s;ua&s;ion
beyond the reach of eloquence&mdash;the look that appalls&mdash;the
&s;upplicating tear that &s;oftens&mdash;the tone tender, but con|firmed,
which at once foothes and convinces the &s;oul&mdash;that
power, which in all the turns and windings of hypocritical
and impudent fal&s;ehood ever ranges on the &s;ide of &s;imple and
unobtruding truth, leads the mind through all the mazes of
craft and wickedne&s;s, with which this my&s;terious villainy is
covered, and arou&s;ing all the indignation of ju&s;tice, points
its puni&s;hment, Heaven-directed, to the head of the dete&s;ted
but unrepenting author.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan proceeded to &s;hew in how many in&s;tances,
and at what critical times the &s;incere friend&s;hip of the Be|gums
had di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf, and been exerted in our
favour. In that critical moment, when after the affair of
Captain Gordon, the intere&s;ts of Mr. Ha&s;tings were, ac|cording
to his own account, almo&s;t de&s;perate; during the
whole time, from the 22d of Augu&s;t to the 22d of Septem|ber,
when with a prodigality of truth he truly confe&s;&s;ed that
the &s;ituation of him&s;elf and his &s;mall party was de&s;perate;&mdash;
when the hoarded vengeance of Heaven was about to bur&s;t,
and &s;eemed to wait only for the completion of his guilt in
the attempt on Cheit Sing, to break on his head, and pre|cipitate
him to ruin&mdash;what did they do? In&s;tead of &s;eizing
on the cri&s;is to carry into effect any &s;cheme they might have
engendered again&s;t him&mdash;in&s;tead of accompli&s;hing his over|throw,
which with their aid would at that moment have
been certain, the&s;e women, with a noblene&s;s worthy of the
&s;ex, though ill applied as to the object, came forward to
&s;hare in, not to contribute to his fall.</P>
<P>So much as to the fir&s;t head of charge again&s;t the Begums.
&mdash;The &s;econd charge, that of their a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Jaghiredars,
he &s;hould &s;ay but little on. We learned in February 1782,
of the Begums having countenanced the re&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;True&mdash;
<PB N="32" REF="30">
And they now gave this pre&s;umed countenance di&s;covered in
February 1782, as a rea&s;on which operated to the ruin of
the Prince&s;&s;es in November 1781. He took notice al&s;o of
the curious circum&s;tance of Mr. Middleton's &s;ending back
the troops at the de&s;ire of the Nabob; but &s;tating that
having done &s;o, the Nabob mu&s;t pay an extraordinary price
in future, as the&s;e troops might be employed again&s;t his
own Aumeels.</P>
<P>He now came to the third charge, &s;aid to be e&s;tabli&s;hed
by tho&s;e affidavits.&mdash;That the Begums had been the prin|cipal
movers of all the commotions in Oude; and here he
confe&s;&s;ed he thought there was &s;uch a body of damning evi|dence
as required only to be &s;tated, and which would render
all elucidation unnece&s;&s;ary. The commotions in Oude were
&s;imply and &s;olely to be attributed to the Engli&s;h gentlemen.
The Nabob's de&s;cription of their rapacity and violence was
it&s;elf a full extention of all that was now to be attributed to
the poor old women. He gave a very particular account of
their depredations. They had but one argument, con&s;i&s;ting
of two words. They wanted all the money that could po&s;|&s;ibly
be rai&s;ed in the country, by violence, by extortion, by
rapine, or by &s;tealth, but for two purpo&s;es, to pay the army,
and fee the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. He &s;tated the various
&s;teps which had been taken by the Nabob, to deliver his
devoted country from their violence, and particularly from
the vulture gra&s;p of Colonel Hannay, until at length, as
Major Naylor wrote, a gentleman, who&s;e &s;oul po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the
qualities of his &s;pecies, "the inhabitants, who&s;e meek natures
no irritation had been theretofore able to provoke, were at
length goaded into tumult; and in their de&s;pair, that meek|ne&s;s,
that yielding, and womani&s;h &s;oftne&s;s which charac|terized
every action, changed to a per&s;evering ob&s;tinacy that
was not to be &s;ubdued."&mdash;So that on the banks of the Ganges
where the in&s;urrection happened, the routed would not fly,
the wounded would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be cured.&mdash;Here
again we had opened to us another vein of the riche&s;t and
<PB N="33" REF="31">
pure&s;t eloquence, and which in daring to touch, we are &s;en|&s;ible
we &s;hall deba&s;e.</P>
<P>If, exclaims Mr. Sheridan, if a &s;tranger had at this tim
(in 1782) gone into the kingdom of Oude, ignorant of what
had happened &s;ince the death of Sujah Dowla, that man
who with a &s;avage heart had &s;till great lines of character,
and who with all his ferocity in war, had &s;till with a culti|vating
hand pre&s;erved to his country the riches which it
derived from benignant &s;kies, and a prolific &s;oil&mdash;if this
&s;tranger, ignorant of all that had happened in the &s;hort in|terval,
and ob&s;erving the wide and general deva&s;tation, and
all the horrors of the &s;cene&mdash;of plains uncloathed and brown
&mdash;of vegetation burnt up and extingui&s;hed&mdash;of villages depo|pulated
and in ruin&mdash;of temples unroofed and peri&s;hing&mdash;of
re&s;ervoirs broken down and dry&mdash;he would naturally en|quire,
what war has thus laid wa&s;te the fertile fields of this
once beautiful and opulent country&mdash;what civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions
have happened thus to tear a&s;under, and &s;eparate the happy
&s;ocieties that once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e villages&mdash;What di&s;puted
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion&mdash;What religious rage has, with unholy violence,
demoli&s;hed tho&s;e temples, and di&s;turbed &s;ervent, but unob|truding
piety, in the exerci&s;e of its duties&mdash;What mercile&s;s
enemy has thus &s;pread the horrors of fire and &s;word&mdash;What
&s;evere vi&s;itation of Providence has thus dried up the foun|tains,
and taken from the face of the earth every ve&s;tige of
green?&mdash;Or rather, what mon&s;ters have &s;talked over the
country, tainting and poi&s;oning with pe&s;tiferous breath,
what the voracious appetite could not devour?&mdash;To &s;uch
que&s;tion, what mu&s;t be the an&s;wer? No wars have ravaged
the&s;e lands and depopulated the&s;e villages&mdash;No civil di&s;cords
have been felt&mdash;No di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion&mdash;No religious rage&mdash;
No mercile&s;s enemy&mdash;No affliction of Providence, which,
while it &s;courged for the moment, cut off the &s;ources of re|&s;u&s;citation
&mdash;No voracious and poi&s;oning mon&s;ters&mdash;No&mdash;All
this has been accompli&s;hed by the <HI>friend&s;hip, genero&s;ity,</HI> and
<HI>kindne&s;s</HI> of the Engli&s;h nation&mdash;They have embraced us with
<PB N="34" REF="32">
their protecting arms&mdash;and, lo, the&s;e are the fruits of their
allian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">. What then, &s;hall we be told, that under &s;uch
circum&s;tances, the exa&s;perated feelings of a whole people,
thus goaded and &s;purred on to clamour and re&s;i&s;tance, were
excited by the poor and feeble influence of the Begums!
When we hear from Capt. Naylor the de&s;cription that he
gives of the paroxi&s;m, fever, and delirium, into which de&s;|pair
had thrown the natives, when on the banks of the
polluted Ganges, panting for death, they tore more widely
open the lips of their gaping wounds, to accelerate their
di&s;&s;olution, and while their blood was i&s;&s;uing, pre&s;ented their
gha&s;tly eyes to Heaven, breathing their la&s;t and fervent
prayer that the dry earth might not be &s;uffered to drink their
blood, but that it might ri&s;e up to the throne of God, and
rou&s;e the eternal Providence to avenge the wrongs of their
country. Will it be &s;aid that all this was brought about by
the incantations of the&s;e Begums in their &s;ecluded Zenana?
or that they could in&s;pire this enthu&s;ia&s;m and this de&s;pair
into the brea&s;ts of a people who felt no grievance, and had
&s;uffered no torture? What motive then could have &s;uch
influence in their bo&s;oms? What motive! That which Na|ture,
the common parent, plants in the bo&s;om of man, and
which, though it may be le&s;s active in the Indian than in
the Engli&s;hman, is &s;till congenial with, and makes a part of
his being.&mdash;That feeling which tells him, that man was
never made to be the property of man; but that when in
the pride and in&s;olence of power, one human creature dares
to tyrannize over another, it is a power u&s;urped, and re&s;i&s;t|ance
is a duty.&mdash;That feeling which tells him that all
power is delegated for the good, not for the injury of the
people, and that when it is converted from the original pur|po&s;e,
the compact is broken, and the power is to be re|&s;umed.
&mdash;That principle which tells him that re&s;i&s;tance to
power u&s;urped is not merely a duty which he owes to him|&s;elf,
and to his neighbour, but a duty which he owes to his
God in a&s;&s;erting and maintaining the rank which he gave
<PB N="35" REF="33">
him in his creation!&mdash;To that common God, who, where
he gives the <HI>form</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> whatever may be the complexion,
gives al&s;o the <HI>feelings</HI> and the <HI>rights</HI> of <HI>man.</HI>&mdash;That principle,
which neither the rudene&s;s of ignorance can &s;tifle, nor the
enervation of re&s;inement extingui&s;h!&mdash;That principle which
makes it ba&s;e for a man to &s;uffer when he ought to act;
which tending to pre&s;erve to the &s;pecies the original de&s;igna|tions
of Providence, &s;purns at the arrogant di&s;tinctions of
man, and vindicates the independent quality of his race.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, after this, proceeded to &s;ay, that he thought
an attentive peru&s;al of all the circum&s;tances, as he had en|deavoured
to exhibit them to the view of their Lord&s;hips, would
&s;atisfy them of the innocence of the Begums. But he was
&s;en&s;ible that the proof of their innocence carried with it no
conclu&s;ive proof of the guilt of the pri&s;oner; and this was
the next object of his &s;peech. In a clo&s;e chain of argument,
he proved that the rebellion was not projected&mdash;was not even
in the imagination of Mr. Ha&s;tings, until their ruin
had been determined; that the rebellion was an after|thought,
and was taken up as a means of ju&s;tification, in
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that ju&s;tification was nece&s;&s;ary. To prove
this, he &s;hewed, that he never wrote to the Council until
the month of February; that though he wrote letters to
Mr. Wheeler, and though, in his famous narrative, he called
the God of Truth to witne&s;s that he had made no conceal|ment,
he concealed every particle, both of the rebellion and
of the plunder, until he had been able to make up the body
of rant and craft, rhap&s;ody and enigma, which he produced
under the title of "A Narrative of the Tran&s;actions." He
&s;hewed, that his pretended rea&s;ons for the concealment of
five months, were direct fallacies; and having taken pains
to elucidate the&s;e points, he &s;aid, that it had been a practice
with Mr. Ha&s;tings to hold him&s;elf out as a preternatural
being, gifted with good fortune, or el&s;e the peculiar favou|rite
of Heaven, and that Providence never failed to take up
and carry, by wi&s;e but hidden means, every project of his
<PB N="36" REF="34">
to its de&s;tined end. In this bla&s;phemous way did the pri&s;oner
at the bar libel the cour&s;e of Providence. Thus, according
to him, when his corruptions and briberies were on the eve
of expo&s;ure, Providence in&s;pired the heart of Nundcomar to
commit a low ba&s;e crime, in order to &s;ave Mr. Ha&s;tings from
ruin. Thus al&s;o, when in his attempts on Cheyt `Sing, and
his plunder of the Begums, Providence &s;tepped in, and in|&s;pired
the one with re&s;i&s;tance, and the other with rebellion,
to forward his purpo&s;es. Thus did he arrogantly hold him|&s;elf
forth as a man, not only the favourite of Providence,
but as one for who&s;e &s;ake Providence departed from the
eternal cour&s;e of its own wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations. Thus did he
pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that he was honoured and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the
admini&s;tration of office by in&s;pired felonies, heaven born
armies, and providential trea&s;ons! arraigning that Provi|dence
who&s;e works are goodne&s;s, and who&s;e ways are
right.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed, through the whole of his defence upon this
charge, that Mr. Ha&s;tings, &s;en&s;ible that truth would undo
him, thought that fal&s;hood of any nature would &s;erve his
turn. In this view he had drawn together a &s;et of fal&s;e|hoods,
without con&s;i&s;tency, and without connection, not
knowing, or not remembering, that there is nothing which
requires &s;o much care in the fabrication as a &s;y&s;tem of lies.
The &s;eries mu&s;t be regular and unbroken; but his fal&s;hoods
were eternally at variance, and demoli&s;hed one another.
Indeed, in all his conduct he &s;eemed to be actuated but by
one principle&mdash;to do things contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed form.
This architecture militated again&s;t the fir&s;t principles of the
art. He begun with the frieze and the capital, and laid the
ba&s;e of the column at the top. Thus having his hou&s;e
turned up-&s;ide down, he plumed him&s;elf on the novelty of
his idea, till it came trembling about his ears. His fortifi|cation
was equal to his architecture. He rai&s;ed a rampart
on a &s;pot which the enemy might command: he meant to
&s;urround him&s;elf with a fo&s;&s;e, but left an opening for the
<PB N="37" REF="35">
a&s;&s;ailant. He built on a precipice, and encamped on a
mine.</P>
<P>Perhaps it might be &s;aid, that that guilt could not be
great, where the veil with which it was covered was &s;o thin.
He was not of this opinion. His honourable and exalted
friend, who had opened generally to their Lord&s;hips the
articles of Impeachment, and who&s;e name he never could
mention but with the re&s;pect and admiration due to his virtue
and his talents; who&s;e proud di&s;dain of vice could only be
equalled by the ability with which he corrected it; who&s;e
eloquence was not tran&s;itory, as happily there were portions
of it that would be felt and admired, when all of the a&s;&s;embly
then pre&s;ent would be mute, and mo&s;t of them forgotten&mdash;
his honourable friend had &s;aid, in opening the charges,
"that there was &s;omething in the nature and conformation
of vice, which made it incon&s;i&s;tent with prudence." He
could not agree implicitly with his honourable friend in this
&s;entiment. If the true definition of prudence were the di&s;|crete
management and conduct of a purpo&s;e to its &s;ucce&s;sful
end, he thought he could imagine to him&s;elf in&s;tances in
which this &s;pecies of prudence might be di&s;covered in minds
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the atrocity of their acts. When he ob|&s;erved
the actions of a Philip of Macedon, of a Cae&s;ar, of a
Cromwell, he could perceive great guilt &s;ucce&s;sfully con|ducted
to its end, if not by legitimate prudence, at lea&s;t by
con&s;ummate craft. It was therefore his opinion, that the
doctrine of his honourable friend held true only in tho&s;e
minds which could not be &s;atisfied with the indulgence of a
&s;ingle crime; where, in&s;tead of one ba&s;e ma&s;ter-pa&s;&s;ion hav|ing
the complete &s;way, to which all the faculties were &s;ubject,
and on which alone the mind was bent, there was a combu&s;|tion
and rivalry among a number of bad pa&s;&s;ions; where
pride, vanity, avarice, lu&s;t of power, cruelty, and &s;o forth,
all at once actuated the human &s;oul, and di&s;tracted its func|tions,
&mdash;all of them clamouring for de&s;truction, and each in
it own barbarous jargon preferring its claim,&mdash;all di&s;&s;onant
<PB N="38" REF="36">
and tumultuous,&mdash;all of them &s;truggling for pre-eminence
and each counteracting the other. In &s;uch a mind, undoubt|edly,
great crimes could never be accompanied by prudence.
There was a fortunate di&s;ability, occa&s;ioned by the conten|tion,
that re&s;cued the human &s;pecies from the villainy of the
intention. Such was the original denunciation of Nature.&mdash;
Not &s;o was it with the pure pa&s;&s;ions: in the brea&s;t where
they re&s;ided, the harmony was never interrupted by the
number; a perfect and &s;ub&s;tantial agreement gave an acce&s;&s;ion
of vigour to each, and &s;preading their influence in every
direction, like the divine intelligence and benignity from
which they flowed, all of them filling their &s;everal &s;paces,
&s;ome in their larger, &s;ome in their more contracted orbits,
moving by &s;weet con&s;ent in their allotted place,&mdash;they &s;e|cured
true glory and happine&s;s to the individual by whom
they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and extended it to the community of
which he was a member.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan was then proceeding to &s;hew, that the Nabob
had violated the covenant of Nature, in ri&s;ing up again&s;t
his mother; but that to this &s;hamele&s;s outrage he was
driven by the tyranny of the pri&s;oner, who, as he had be|fore
&s;aid, had made him a <HI>&s;lave,</HI> to compel him to become
&mdash;a <HI>mon&s;ter!</HI></P>

<HEAD>MR. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>TUESDAY, JUNE THE 10th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN began without any other preface
than this, that relying on the indulgence with which
he had been hitherto &s;o largely honored, he would re&s;ume his
&s;peech, he &s;aid, where he had &s;topped on the preceding day,
without taking up any of their Lord&s;hips time in preliminary
matter. He had left off with that part of the body of evi|dence
which proved the abject &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage in which
the Nabob was held, and by which it was, in his opinion,
rendered manife&s;t, that every act of his, particularly tho&s;e
&s;trong acts in which he violated every obligation of a &s;on,
were done not merely at the in&s;tigation, but ab&s;olutely at
the command of the pri&s;oner. It would not be difficult to
prove, that if he had been independent he certainly would
not have committed tho&s;e acts, and this he &s;hould be able to
demon&s;trate to their Lord&s;hips. But fir&s;t he begged leave to
&s;ay, that in the perpetration of tho&s;e &s;hameful and atrocious
crimes which made the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent charge, there
were three principal, and three &s;ubordinate actors. The
three principal, or rather the one great and leading princi|pal,
with his two chief coadjutors, were Mr. Ha&s;tings,
Mr. Middleton, and Sir Elijah Impey.&mdash;The three &s;ubordi|nate
actors were Colonel Hannay, Hyder Beg Cawn, and
Ali Abram Cawn. Before he proceeded to &s;hew that every
<PB N="40" REF="38">
one of the acts were forcibly impo&s;ed on the Nabob, he
made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on part of the evidence of Sir Elijah
Impey. He had given as a rea&s;on for not having at any
time after he took the affidavits, conver&s;ed with Mr. Ha&s;tings
on the &s;ubject to which they alluded, that he quitted Chunar
the next day, and that therefore he had not had an oppor|tunity
of &s;eeing, in order to conver&s;e with him on that or
any &s;ubject. Mr. Sheridan &s;hewed, from letters written by
Sir Elijah and Mr. Ha&s;tings, that they had quitted Chunar
in company, and had continued together for &s;ome time. Sir
Elijah had &s;tated al&s;o, that he had delivered the affidavits
into the hands of Mr. Ha&s;tings, and knew nothing of them
afterwards. Mr. Sheridan &s;hewed that Major Davie had
received the Per&s;ian affidavits from Sir Elijah to tran&s;late on
the 12th of December, although Sir Elijah had &s;aid that he
gave them to Mr. Ha&s;tings previous to his quitting Chunar,
which was on the 1&s;t of December. Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, he
took notice of the&s;e facts ju&s;t to &s;hew the re&s;pect that was to
be paid to the te&s;timony of Sir Elijah.</P>
<P>With regard to the affidavits as a body of evidence, the
whole was mere hear&s;ay and rumour. Captain Scott, who
by being in the country where the &s;cene of the rebellion was
&s;aid to lye, had had a good opportunity of knowing the
facts, was not examined, and the te&s;timony of Hoolas Roy,
who of all others was the be&s;t informed on the &s;ubject, was
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed. That his affidavit was taken was manife&s;t, and
he called on the pri&s;oner to &s;ay where this affidavit was con|cealed,
and why it was withheld. Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, that
in the celebrated letter written by Mr. Ha&s;tings, dated the
19th of December, his own knowledge of the tran&s;actions
was the mo&s;t confu&s;ed and contradictory that could be ima|gined.
He enumerated the various contradictions of that
letter.&mdash;He &s;aid that Mr. Ha&s;tings had made a number of
curious a&s;&s;ertions in regard to the plunder of the trea&s;ures,
and re&s;umption of the jaghires.&mdash;The propo&s;ition was fir&s;t
made to him, that the trea&s;ures &s;hould be taken as an alter|native
<PB N="41" REF="39">
for the jaghires, but in making that propo&s;ition it
was &s;aid, that they belonged of right to the Nabob.&mdash;Mr.
Ha&s;tings took it in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, as he called it; that was,
he determined to &s;eize on the trea&s;ures, not as an alternative
for the jaghires, but to take them fir&s;t becau&s;e the propo&s;i|tion
was made, and to take the jaghires afterwards. He
was very anxious to have it believed that the propo&s;ition
came from the Nabob, although, by the whole tenor of Mr.
Middleton's letters, confidential as well as public, it was
demon&s;trated with what difficulty they were able to extort
from him his con&s;ent to the violence. Mr. Sheridan adverted
to the curious letter written by Mr. Ha&s;tings to Mr. Middle|ton
and Mr. John&s;on, &s;aying that the treaty made by him
with the Nabob at Chunar, from its favourable tendency,
had given ri&s;e to &s;u&s;picions that money had been taken to
procure it, and calling on them to exculpate them&s;elves.&mdash;
Upon which they with great formality declared on their
honours, and before God, that they had neither received
any bribe, nor had an idea of any; which declaration,
made with &s;o much &s;olemnity, &s;atisfied Mr. Ha&s;tings, ari|&s;ing
a little perhaps from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he had the
money in his pocket. Mr. Sheridan proceeded to &s;hew,
that &s;o far from the&s;e acts being done at the in&s;tigation of
the Nabob, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that they could
receive from him a formal &s;anction, and on this &s;ubject
&s;everal letters were read by Mr. Adam, and in particular he
reconciled the letters written by Middleton on the 1&s;t and
6th of December, by &s;aying that in regard to the &s;eizure of
the trea&s;ure of the Begums he only required a hint from Mr.
Ha&s;tings, but as the re&s;umption of the jaghires was likely to
be a &s;ervice of danger, there nothing le&s;s than a public order
would &s;atisfy Mr. Middleton. After arguing this point
with dexterity, Mr. Sheridan came to the extraordinary
letters of Mr. Middleton, dated on the 30th of December,
wherein they are intended for the confidential and private
u&s;e of Mr. Ha&s;tings; he denied the truth of what he had
<PB N="42" REF="40">
&s;aid in his public di&s;patch, which was to be &s;ubmitted to the
Council, and &s;aying at the &s;ame time that if Mr. Ha&s;tings
wi&s;hed him to &s;ay any thing, or to give any other colour to
the proceedings, he was ready to do it. Mr. Sheridan,
after placing this di&s;graceful &s;ub&s;erviency in &s;o glaring a
point of view, reque&s;ted Mr. Adam to read other letters
nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate this part of the charge, and to &s;hew
the anxious pains and &s;olicitude of Mr. Ha&s;tings to e&s;tabli&s;h
&s;omething like an excu&s;e for the turpitude of his conduct.</P>
<P>&dtristar;While the&s;e letters were reading, Mr. Sheridan, who
was &s;eized with a &s;udden, though flight indi&s;po&s;ition,
retired to the Managers room. He was, after &s;ome
refre&s;hment, de&s;irous of proceeding; but his friends
per&s;uaded him to the contrary; and Mr. Fox came
into the Court, and &s;aid, that Mr. Sheridan being by
his indi&s;po&s;ition prevented from doing that ju&s;tice to
the charge which it was his wi&s;h to do, the Managers
reque&s;ted that their Lord&s;hips would be plea&s;ed to
adjourn, and appoint another day on which he might
proceed.</P>
<P>Their Lord&s;hips accordingly withdrew, and &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age
to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the Court will &s;it
again on Friday the 13th.</P>

<HEAD>MR. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH CONTINUED,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, JUNE THE 13th, 1788.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN ro&s;e, and being in a great mea&s;ure
recovered from the indi&s;po&s;ition which prevented him
from proceeding on Tue&s;day, re&s;umed his &s;peech, by thank|ing
their Lord&s;hips for the indulgence they had &s;hewn him,
and a&s;&s;ured them that nothing but po&s;itive inability to pro|ceed,
on Tue&s;day, in a manner worthy of the importance,
and the dignity of his cau&s;e, could have induced him to
give them the trouble of &s;itting another day.</P>
<P>He then reminded their Lord&s;hips, that in commenting
on the evidence re&s;pecting the re&s;umption of the jaghires,
and the plunder of the Begums, he had left off with the
public and private corre&s;pondence between Mr. Ha&s;tings
and Mr. Middleton. This corre&s;pondence demanded the
mo&s;t minute attention, for it contained all the facts of that
foul and unmanly con&s;piracy; it contained a true account of
the cau&s;e of that con&s;piracy, and al&s;o the quibbles, the
tricks, the mean &s;hifts and eva&s;ions, by which it had been
attempted to conceal it.</P>
<P>On the public corre&s;pondence, as contra&s;ted with the
private, he animadverted with the mo&s;t penetrating acute|ne&s;s;
and expo&s;ed the gro&s;s contradictions, the laboured
fallacies, and &s;tudied mi&s;repre&s;entations that pervaded the
whole.&mdash;Their Lord&s;hips would naturally enquire with &s;ome
<PB N="44" REF="42">
degree of &s;urpri&s;e, how the private letters that were thus to
e&s;tabli&s;h the guilt of their authors had come to light.&mdash;In
the middle of December, 1782, a coldne&s;s had taken place
between Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Middleton. Mr. Ha&s;tings had
been hurt at the tardine&s;s with which Middleton proceeded,
and had charged him with the heinous offence of per|mitting
two days forbearance from the Nabob to his mother.
&mdash;From this moment &s;hyne&s;s and &s;u&s;picion between the
principal and the agent took place. Mr. Middleton he&s;i|tated
about the expediency of the mea&s;ure, and began to
doubt whether the advantage would be equal to the ri&s;k.
Mr. Ha&s;tings, whether he apprehended that Middleton was
retarded by any return of humanity or &s;entiments of ju&s;tice,
by any &s;ecret combination with the Begum and her &s;on, or
a wi&s;h to take the lion's &s;hare of the plunder to him&s;elf, was
incen&s;ed at the delay. Mr. Middleton repre&s;ented the unwil|lingne&s;s
of the Nabob to put in execution the re&s;umption of
the jaghires; the low &s;tate of his finances; that his troops
were mutinous for want of pay; and that his life had been
in danger from an in&s;urrection among them. That in this
moment of di&s;tre&s;s he had offered one hundred thou&s;and
pounds, in addition to a like &s;um paid before, as an equiva|lent
for the re&s;umption which was demanded of him. Of
this offer, however, it appeared the Nabob knew nothing.
In conferring an obligation, it was &s;ometimes contrived,
from motives of delicacy, that the name of the donor &s;hould
be concealed from the per&s;on obliged; but here was delicacy
of a new &s;ort&mdash;the per&s;on conferring the favour was to be
kept ignorant that he had conferred it. Yet, after the re|turn
of Middleton in 1783, there was the &s;ame friendly col|lu&s;ion,
the &s;ame fraudulent familiarity, between him and
Mr. Ha&s;tings, that had exi&s;ted before this difference took
place. He was brought down in December, 1782, and no
charge was brought again&s;t him till April following. Then
it was that Mr. Ha&s;tings, in a &s;udden fit of ju&s;tice, preferred
the charge again&s;t him, and threw down his letters on the
<PB N="45" REF="43">
Council-table. Whatever was the meaning of this charge,
whether it was a juggle to elude enquiry, or whether it was
intended to make an impre&s;&s;ion at Fyzabad; whether Mr.
Ha&s;tings drew up the charge, and in&s;tructed Mr. Middleton
to draw up an ea&s;y defence; or whether Middleton drew up
the charge, and Mr. Ha&s;tings the defence, there appeared in
the whole tran&s;action the &s;ame habitual collu&s;ion in which
they lived&mdash;and it ended in a rhap&s;ody, a repartee, and a
poetical quotation. By this act of providential folly, the
private letters were produced, and the production of them
was conclu&s;ive proof of the con&s;piracy. The private letters
were the only part of the corre&s;pondence to be looked to.
They were written in the confidence of private communica|tion,
without any of the motives to palliate and colour
facts, to confound and mi&s;lead the judgment, which ap|peared
on the very face of the public corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then referred to a letter from Lucknow,
written under &s;uch particular circum&s;tances, and at &s;uch a
particular period, that had the alledged rebellion of the
Begums ever exi&s;ted, but in imagination, it mu&s;t have been
mentioned in that letter. Where then was the proof of the
rebellion? Not where it ought naturally to be found, but in
the affidavits collected by Sir Elijah Impey&mdash;In the fabri|cated
public corre&s;pondence between him, Mr. Ha&s;tings,
and Mr. Middleton. In that letter there was no mention of
rebellion. It was indeed &s;aid, that if &s;uch mea&s;ures were
rigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued as had been &s;et on foot, the people might
be driven from murmur to re&s;i&s;tance, and ri&s;e up in arms
again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors. Then indeed a little providential
&s;laughter would &s;ub&s;tantiate the rebellion which they wi&s;hed
to find, and afford a pretext for premeditated plunder. But
there was a clum&s;ine&s;s in the fraud, a coar&s;ene&s;s in the exe|cution
which defeated its purpo&s;e, and expo&s;ed it to detec|tion.</P>
<P>He animadverted with much &s;everity on the conduct of
Sir Elijah Impey, in collecting the affidavits. At one mo|ment
<PB N="46" REF="44">
he appeared in Oude, at another in Chunar, at a third
in Benares, collecting affidavits. The gravity of his bu&s;ine&s;s
and the vivacity, the rapidity, the celerity of his move|ments,
made a &s;ingular contra&s;t. To him might have been
applied the words of Hamlet to the gho&s;t, "What, True|penny!
are you there?" Like the gho&s;t he was heard in
every quarter crying aloud, <HI>&s;wear!</HI> But the &s;imilitude
went no farther; he was never heard to give the injunction,
<Q><L>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy &s;oul contrive</L>
<L>Again&s;t thy mother ought.</L></Q>
In the memorable private letter from Mr. Middleton of
the 28th of December, 1781, in which he acknowledged
the receipt of a private letter from Mr. Ha&s;tings, although
no private letters from the pri&s;oner had been produced&mdash;a
circum&s;tance which could only be accounted for, and ari&s;e
from the habitual awe in which Middleton was kept by the
domineering power and fa&s;cinating influence of his ma&s;ter.
In this letter, Middleton told him, that in the pre&s;ent fer|mented
&s;tate of the country, the re&s;umption could not be
accompli&s;hed but with infinite hazard&mdash;At the &s;ame time
Mr. John&s;on wrote him to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The words of
his letter were memorable. He thought it would require a
<HI>campaign</HI> to carry into execution the orders for the re&s;ump|tion
of the Jaghires. A campaign again&s;t whom! Again&s;t
the officers and army of their ally, the Nabob, who had given
the order. This re&s;umption was &s;tated to be for his good,
and for the good of his country, and it was only to be ac|compli&s;hed
by a campaign. Such was the manner in which
the Engli&s;h, under the au&s;pices of Mr. Ha&s;tings, protected
their allies in India. The protection of the Engli&s;h was the
mi&s;ery and ruin of the protected. It was the protection of
the vulture to the lamb, which covers while it devours its
prey&mdash;which &s;tretching its baleful pinions, and hovering in
mid air, di&s;per&s;es the kites and le&s;&s;er birds of prey, and
&s;aves the innocent and helple&s;s victim from all talons but its
own.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45">
It was curious to remark, that in the corre&s;pondence of
the&s;e creatures of Mr. Ha&s;tings, and in their earne&s;t endea|vours
to di&s;&s;uade him from the re&s;umption of the Jaghires,
not a word is mentioned of the mea&s;ure's being contrary to
honour, to faith, derogatory to national character, unmanly
or unprincipled.&mdash;No &s;uch thing&mdash;They knew the man to
whom they were writing, and their only arguments were,
that it was contrary to policy, to expediency&mdash;and that the
event was not likely to pro&s;per in the only way in which it
could be worth the attempt&mdash;in the accumulation of money.
Not one word did they mention of the ju&s;t claims which the
Nabob had to the gratitude and friend&s;hip of the Engli&s;h&mdash;
Not one &s;yllable of the treaty by which we were bound to
protect him&mdash;Not one &s;yllable of the relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
between him and the ladies they were about to plunder&mdash;
Not one &s;yllable was hinted about ju&s;tice or mercy&mdash;nothing
was ever addre&s;&s;ed to him but the apprehen&s;ion that the
money to be procured would not be worth the danger and
labour with which it mu&s;t be attended. Such was the &s;ource
and origin of all his actions, and it was that ba&s;e and profli|gate
motive that, urging him to every &s;pecies of meanne&s;s
and of cruelty, did give &s;uch a &s;tamp and impre&s;&s;ion to his
acts as made them unparalleled in ancient or modern hi&s;tory.
He would be bold to &s;ay, that nothing could be found in the
hi&s;tory of human turpitude, nothing in the nervous delinea|tions
and penetrating brevity of Tacitus, nothing in the
luminous and luxuriant pages of Gibbon, or of any other
hi&s;torian, dead or living, who, &s;earching into mea&s;ures and
characters with the rigour of truth, pre&s;ented to our abhor|rence
depravity in its blacke&s;t &s;hapes, could equal, in the
gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the guilt, in the hardne&s;s of heart with which
it was conducted, or in the low and groveling motive, the
acts and character of Mr. Ha&s;tings&mdash;He, who in the ba&s;e
de&s;ire of &s;tripping two helple&s;s women, could &s;tir the &s;on to
ri&s;e up in vengeance again&s;t them&mdash;who when that &s;on had
certain touches of nature in his brea&s;t&mdash;certain feelings of
<PB N="48" REF="46">
an awakened con&s;cience to indicate that he was a man&mdash;ac|cu&s;ed
that &s;on of entertaining peevi&s;h objections to the plun|der
and &s;acrifice of his mother&mdash;Who having de&s;troyed in
his bo&s;om all thought&mdash;all reflection&mdash;all memory&mdash;all con|&s;cience&mdash;all
tenderne&s;s and duty as a &s;on&mdash;all dignity as a
monarch&mdash;having de&s;troyed his character, and depopulated
his country, at length brought him to violate the deare&s;t ties
of nature, and countenance the de&s;truction of his parents&mdash;
and who having thus debauched this poor and mi&s;erable in|&s;trument
of his crimes to his purpo&s;e, deceived and ruined
him in turn. He&mdash;this inhuman violator of all ties, &s;acred
and profane, had in this &s;ingle crime, he would be bold to
&s;ay, no parallel nor prototype in the old world, or the new,
from the day of original &s;in to the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>And yet when in this climax he thought he had got to the
&s;ummit and pinnacle of his guilt, he found &s;omething &s;till
more tran&s;cendently flagitious. He particularly alluded to
his famous letter, fal&s;ely dated the 15th of February, 1782,
in which, at the very moment that he had given the order
for the entire de&s;truction of the Begums, and for the re&s;ump|tion
of the jaghires, expre&s;&s;ed to the Nabob the warm and
lively intere&s;t which he took in his welfare&mdash;the &s;incerity and
ardour of his friend&s;hip&mdash;and that though his pre&s;ence was
imminently wanted at Calcutta, he could not re&s;t a moment
without coming to the Nabob's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in the mean
time, he had &s;ent four regiments to his aid.&mdash;So deliberate
and cool&mdash;&s;o hypocritical and in&s;inuating was the villainy of
this man! The heart was exa&s;perated by the malignity of
this arch trea&s;on&mdash;But at length the Nabob was on his guard
&mdash;He could not be deceived by this ma&s;k&mdash;The offer of the
four regiments developed the object of Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;He
perceived the dagger bunglingly concealed in the hand that
was held out with a &s;mile to meet him&mdash;and we accordingly
heard no more from the Nabob of reliance on the friend&s;hip
of Mr. Ha&s;tings.&mdash;This letter was &s;ent at the very time when
the troops had &s;urrounded the walls of Fyzabad, and now
<PB N="49" REF="47">
began the &s;cene of horrors, which, if he merely wi&s;hed to
rou&s;e their Lord&s;hips feelings, he &s;hould only have occa&s;ion
minutely to de&s;cribe. To &s;tate the violence committed on
that palace, which the piety of the kingdom had rai&s;ed for
the retreat and &s;eclu&s;ion of the objects of its pride and vene|ration.
He thought he &s;aw innocence repo&s;ing in tho&s;e &s;hades,
rendered &s;acred by &s;uper&s;tition.&mdash;Venerable age and helple&s;s
infancy here found an a&s;ylum, and to the violation of this
&s;cene were &s;ent an Impey to invigorate the flagging con&s;ci|ence
of a Middleton;&mdash;and an Ali Khan a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;touter
villainy of a Hyder Beg. Rapine, outrage, and violence
followed in the train, while Ha&s;tings, though &s;tanding aloof,
was in fact the ma&s;ter general of the war, and through the
whole of the dreadful &s;cene of horror their Lord&s;hips &s;aw
him&mdash;"ride in the whirlwind, and direct the &s;torm."</P>
<P>He now with an admirable accuracy and force of rea&s;oning
went over the corre&s;pondence, which then pa&s;&s;ed between
Middleton and the Begums; he particularly alluded to the
letter &s;ent by the Begum to Middleton, with his an&s;wer, in
which he declared him&s;elf equally the friend of the Nabob
and the Begum, although he had previou&s;ly &s;worn in the pre|&s;ence
of God, that he thought &s;he had ho&s;tile de&s;igns again&s;t
her &s;on and the Engli&s;h, and had made up his con&s;cience to
&s;trip her of every thing &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He execrated the &s;hame|le&s;s
&s;ycophancy of this conduct, that like &s;ome of the mon|&s;ters
of India, cringed to its prey, and fawned on the objects
of its vengeance. In going over the&s;e private letters, he came
to that from Mr. Middleton, which the Council for the pri|&s;oner
had been anxious to have read to the end, in order to
publi&s;h an anecdote which they thought would do &s;omething
towards &s;upporting the character of Mr. Middleton. It con|tained
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of earne&s;t and anxious &s;olicitude for
the recovery of a beloved &s;on&mdash;and which they meant to in|&s;inuate,
were indications of feeling, and of his &s;en&s;e of the
nature of the relative duty and affection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
the parent and the child. How fortunate they had
<PB N="50" REF="48">
been in their de&s;ire of having this anecdote heard, he knew
not&mdash;He confe&s;&s;ed he thought it did not tend to rai&s;e the cha|racter
of Mr. Middleton&mdash;but on the contrary, it operated
very much to his prejudice. It would not be imputed to
him, that &s;peaking ab&s;tractedly, he con&s;idered the trait of
parental tenderne&s;s as a degrading feature in the human heart.
Their Lord&s;hips knew well the force of the &s;oft and endear|ing
relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between parent and child; but
&s;urely it would not be &s;aid, that the circum&s;tance brought
to their Lord&s;hips view by the Coun&s;el, of the fact of Mr.
Middleton's having this &s;entiment and feeling in his bo&s;om
was therefore intitled to commendation, when with the feel|ing
in his own bo&s;om he was outraging it in others. Was it
not an aggravation of his guilt, that he who felt the ardent
&s;olicitude of a parent, and who con&s;equently mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible
of the reciprocal feelings of a child, could bring him&s;elf to
tear a&s;under, and to violate all tho&s;e dear and &s;acred bonds!
Did it not enhance his guilt, that his cruelty was not the re|&s;ult
of ideotic ignorance, or of &s;avage barbarity?&mdash;That he
who&s;e &s;oul was thus &s;en&s;ible to the impre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s
and love, &s;hould be &s;o abandoned as to &s;acrifice tho&s;e feelings
to the inhuman will of the tyrant whom he &s;erved. He aver|red
that it increa&s;ed and magnified his guilt. He would have
been le&s;s criminal had he been in&s;en&s;ible of tenderne&s;s&mdash;le&s;s
criminal if he had not been &s;o thoroughly acquainted with
the true quality of parental love and filial duty. [Here Mr.
Sheridan gave a picture of filial duty, which, as a piece of
cha&s;te and beautiful painting in language, we know not where
to equal, and which we are utterly unable to copy.]</P>
<P>Filial duty, he &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible by words to de&s;cribe,
but de&s;cription by words was unnece&s;&s;ary. It was that duty
which they all felt and under&s;tood, and which required not
the powers of language to explain. It was in truth more
properly to be called a principle than a duty. It required
not the aid of memory&mdash;it needed not the exerci&s;e of the un|der&s;tanding
&mdash;it awaited not the &s;low deliberations of rea&s;on|ing.
<PB N="51" REF="49">
&mdash;It flowed &s;pontaneou&s;ly from the fountain of our feel|ings.
&mdash;It was involuntary in our natures.&mdash;It was a quality
of our being, innate, and coeval with life, which though af|terwards
cheri&s;hed as a pa&s;&s;ion was independent of our men|tal
powers.&mdash;It was earlier than all intelligence in our &s;ouls.
&mdash;It di&s;played it&s;elf in the earlie&s;t impul&s;es of the heart, and
was an emotion of fondne&s;s that returned in &s;miles of grati|tude
the affectionate &s;olicitude&mdash;the tender anxieties&mdash;the
endearing attentions experienced before memory began, but
which were not le&s;s dear for not being remembered.&mdash;It was
the &s;acrament of nature in our hearts, by which the union
of parent and child was &s;ealed and rendered perfect in the
community of love, and which, &s;trengthening and ripening
with life, acquired vigour from the under&s;tanding, and was
mo&s;t lively and active when mo&s;t wanted&mdash;when tho&s;e who
had &s;upported infancy were &s;inking into age, and when in|firmity
and decrepitude found their be&s;t &s;olace in the affecti|ons
of the children they had reared&mdash;But he was a&s;hamed to
take up &s;o much of their Lord&s;hips time in attempting to
give a cold picture of filial duty, when he &s;aw &s;o many
breathing te&s;timonies in the a&s;&s;embly that &s;urrounded him&mdash;
and when he &s;aw every feature of that a&s;&s;embly beaming and
erecting it&s;elf in confe&s;&s;ion of the univer&s;al principle.</P>
<P>The manner of di&s;po&s;ing of the goods violently &s;eized from
the unfortunate Prince&s;&s;es, their jewels; their wearing appa|rel,
their furniture even to their table uten&s;ils, though in &s;ig|nificant
objects when compared with other circum&s;tances of
their unhappy &s;ituation, was marked with inju&s;tice and op|pre&s;&s;ion.
&mdash;They were &s;old, or at lea&s;t put up to &s;ale, by auc|tion
&mdash;a pretended &s;ale, where there were no bidders, who
had not previou&s;ly agreed on what they &s;hould purcha&s;e, and
how much they &s;hould pay for dividing the &s;poil. This the
Begum her&s;elf lamented in very affecting terms, in a repre|&s;entation
to Mr. Middleton, when &s;he &s;ays that &s;he finds,
from woeful experience, that even bullion, gold, and jewels,
lo&s;e their value the moment it is known they come from her.
<PB N="52" REF="50">
But the rapacity of Middleton did not &s;top there, for after
having thus fraudulently di&s;po&s;ed of the goods, a new claim
was made for the deficiency, and new cruelties were perpe|trated
to enforce the payment of a &s;um which did not con|&s;titute
a part of the original fine. Attempts were made to
find out new crimes and new debts due by the Nabob to the
Company, though he had already offended to the amount of
600,000l. Mr. Ha&s;tings writes to Mr. Middleton not to
come to a final &s;ettlement with the Nabob till he &s;hould con|&s;ult
his CASH-BOOK, which was the faithful record of the
crimes of their allies, and in which he had already di&s;covered
260,000l. worth of trea&s;on, that no per&s;on had ever before
dreamed of. He accu&s;es by the <HI>Multiplication Table,</HI> tries
by the <HI>Rule of Three,</HI> and condemns, not by the &s;ublime
in&s;titute of Timur, or the &s;imple maxims of Engli&s;h juri&s;|prudence,
but by the unerring rules of <HI>Cocker's Arithmetic.</HI>
&mdash;He then proceeded to animadvert on the te&s;timony of
Major Scott, whom he called the incomparable agent of
Mr. Ha&s;tings. He had come to the bar, and &s;aid, that
though the Defence of Mr. Ha&s;tings had not been drawn up
by him&s;elf, yet there was one paragraph which he (Mr.
Ha&s;tings) had written with his own <HI>proper</HI> hand. That pa|ragraph
was avowing the re&s;umption of the Jaghires, and
averring it to be con&s;i&s;tent with the dictates of humanity,
policy, and ju&s;tice. "Give me the pen, &s;aid Mr. Ha&s;tings;
"I will defend the mea&s;ure as ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. Do you
find <HI>memory,</HI> I will find <HI>character!</HI>" And thus the <HI>twin
warriors</HI> came into the field, each in his proper &s;phere of
action, and armed for either purpo&s;e. Such had been the
daring and unblu&s;hing defence of Mr. Ha&s;tings, for the
commi&s;&s;ion of an act, on which their Lord&s;hips could have
but one opinion. That it was not con&s;i&s;tent with the dic|tates
of ju&s;tice, he appealed to tho&s;e who&s;e peculiar province
it was to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e of your Lord&s;hips, &s;aid
be, who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed as State&s;men, will &s;purn at
the idea of its being a mea&s;ure that can be ju&s;tified on the
<PB N="53" REF="51">
principles of good policy; and that it is not to be defended
by the laws of humanity, he would appeal to that venerable
part of the augu&s;t tribunal who heard him&mdash;they who had
ever proved them&s;elves the di&s;tingui&s;hed advocates of reli|gion
and truth.</P>
<P>He now came to the recital of the cruelties perpetrated by
the agents of Mr. Ha&s;tings, which he pledged him&s;elf to
bring home to the bold culprit at the bar. The fir&s;t act of
their tyranny was the impri&s;onment of the Mini&s;ters of the
Begums, who were per&s;ons of con&s;iderable eminence and
di&s;tinction in that country, and who had enjoyed much of
the confidence and favour of the late Nabob. Not &s;atisfied
with this, they were loaded with irons, and &s;uffered the
combined horrors of want, impri&s;onment, and ignominy;
but what aggravated the &s;candalous inju&s;tice of this mea&s;ure
was, that they had &s;uffered without even the formality of an
enquiry, while that <HI>arch traitor,</HI> Shum&s;haw Cawn, though
accu&s;ed of di&s;affection to the Engli&s;h Government, was &s;uf|fered
to go about without notice; he had been &s;o much
neglected by tho&s;e in power that he had not even been com|plimented
with <HI>fetters,</HI> the u&s;ual badge of di&s;tinction, which
it was the practice to be&s;tow on opulent traitors.&mdash;To his
poverty he owed his protection.&mdash;The unfortunate Mini&s;ters
of the Begums not having yet &s;atisfied the rapacity of the&s;e
plunderers, were ordered to Chunar, where the Engli&s;h flag
was flying as the &s;ignal of oppre&s;&s;ion, there to have corporal
puni&s;hment inflicted on them, and one of them actually &s;uf|fered
it, to the di&s;grace of the honour, the ju&s;tice, and hu|manity
of the Briti&s;h nation. What mu&s;t have been the
feelings of the Briti&s;h officers upon that occa&s;ion, he mu&s;t
leave tho&s;e to &s;ay who were pre&s;ent. To Major Gilpin he
gave much prai&s;e, not only for the candid evidence he gave
at the bar; but for his humane endeavour to alleviate the
&s;ufferings of the unhappy women, for they were the next
objects of Mr. Middleton's <HI>humanity.</HI> The conduct of Mr.
John&s;on was of a different kind, though he certainly had
<PB N="54" REF="52">
&s;ome claim to prai&s;e from his <HI>forbearance</HI>&mdash;he very <HI>humanely</HI>
writes to Middleton that he did not think it would be <HI>worth
while</HI> to put to death 2000 women and children for the pur|po&s;e
of enforcing prompt payment of their demands; but
actuated by the fear of the dreadful re&s;pon&s;ibility under
which Mr. Ha&s;tings had placed all his agents, they pro|ceeded
to carry his orders into execution, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Palace. The &s;ufferings of the women were patheti|cally
de&s;cribed by Major Gilpin. In a letter dated the 30th
October, 1782, he writes as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">La&s;t night, about
eight o'clock, the women in the Khord Mohul, (Le&s;&s;er
Palace) or Zenana, (womens apartment under the charge
of Latafut Ally Khan) a&s;&s;embled on the tops of the build|ings,
crying in a mo&s;t lamentable manner for food; that
for the la&s;t four days they had got but a very &s;canty allow|ance,
and that ye&s;terday they had got none. The melan|choly
cries of famine are more ea&s;ily imagined than
de&s;cribed.&mdash;</Q>After &s;uch a de&s;cription of calamity, he
&s;aid, he would not tre&s;pa&s;s on the feelings of their Lord&s;hips
by any comments on it. Their indignation again&s;t the
author of tho&s;e calamities rendered any further ob&s;ervations
on that &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary. It was now for him to prove
that Mr. Ha&s;tings was re&s;pon&s;ible for the actions of his
agents. That he was re&s;pon&s;ible for the Treaty of Chunar,
he believed, would &s;carcely be di&s;puted&mdash;though Mr. Mid|dleton
had on the la&s;t day of his examination refu&s;ed to
an&s;wer &s;ome que&s;tions on that &s;ubject, le&s;t it might criminate
him&s;elf. With an avarice for infamy, and an anxious
de&s;ire of monopolizing guilt, Mr. Middleton, when que&s;|tioned
about his conduct at Fyzabad, had an&s;wered that he
alone was to blame, for Mr. Ha&s;tings had written an angry
letter to him, di&s;approving of what he had done; but what,
&s;aid he, will be your Lord&s;hips a&s;toni&s;hment, when you are
told that this letter from Mr. Ha&s;tings contained a gentle
reproach to Mr. Middleton, not for his want of humanity,
but for his lenity! Such was his anxiety to court infamy,
<PB N="55" REF="53">
and to &s;olicit guilt, that he &s;crupled not to encounter igno|miny
when he might have claimed prai&s;e!</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings had urged in his defence, that as he was
not privy to the actions, he could not be re&s;pon&s;ible for the
guilt. This was not true. Mr. Ha&s;tings well knew what
was going forward, though, perhaps, he might be unac|quainted
with the mi&s;erable detail. When a per&s;on in
authority de&s;ires another to do an illegal act, he certainly is,
to all intents and purpo&s;es, an&s;werable for the con&s;equences.
He becomes the principal in the crime, though he might not
be the actual perpetrator of it, and is con&s;idered, by every
principle of natural law and natural rea&s;on, as the fir&s;t object
of puni&s;hment. What were the orders given by Mr. Ha&s;t|ings?
They were peremptory&mdash;and it is proved by Middleton
him&s;elf, that he could not have carried them into execution
by any other means than tho&s;e which had been adopted.
Would any man then be hardy enough to a&s;&s;ert, that Mr.
Ha&s;tings was not in this in&s;tance an&s;werable for the act of his
agent? The communications of Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Mid|dleton
had been frequent and uninterrupted; though he mu&s;t
&s;ay they were more like the &s;ecret machinations of a banditti
in a cavern, plotting the de&s;truction of &s;ome innocent family.
than the deliberations of Briti&s;h Repre&s;entatives in India.</P>
<P>Mr. Middleton, however, had at lea&s;t &s;ome regard to
decorum on particular occa&s;ions, for, in an&s;wer to Mr.
Ha&s;tings's letter, accu&s;ing him of lenity and forbearance in
the execution of his orders, he an&s;wers, "That the Nabob
was <HI>&s;on</HI> to the Begum whom we were to proceed again&s;t;
&mdash;a <HI>&s;on</HI> again&s;t his <HI>mother</HI> mu&s;t at lea&s;t &s;ave <HI>appearances</HI> in
his mode of proceeding." But Mr. Ha&s;tings all along
pretends complete ignorance of the cruelties that were perpe|trated,
that is, he was ignorant of the exact number of
la&s;hes which were inflected, and the preci&s;e weight of the
iron which formed the fetters.&mdash;Such was the mi&s;erable
&s;ophi&s;try by which he defended him&s;elf, though his guilt
<PB N="56" REF="54">
was the &s;ame as if he had with his own hand inflicted the
puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>He then took notice of that part of Mr. Ha&s;tings's defence,
the object of which was to criminate the re&s;t of the Board,
or at lea&s;t to prove that they were equally guilty with him.
Had Sir John Macpher&s;on then (of who&s;e character he
thought highly) no friend that would call him to the bar,
to vindicate him&s;elf from &s;o foul an a&s;per&s;ion? Was there
nobody to do ju&s;tice to the memory of Mr. Wheeler? For
his own part, he was ready to acquit the Members of the
Board from any &s;hare in the guilt of the black catalogue of
Mr. Ha&s;tings's crimes, though their agreeing to &s;ign the
di&s;patch to the Court of Directors, not one paragraph of
which was true, was a very inexcu&s;able, and even a criminal
credulity. After commenting with great ingenuity and force
of rea&s;oning on the different paragraphs of the letter to the
Court of Directors, with a view to prove that the whole was
a fabrication, calculated &s;olely to promote the views of
Mr. Ha&s;tings, he &s;aid, he was convinced that Sir John
Macpher&s;on was now a&s;hamed of his credulity, and would
be glad of an opportunity of vindicating him&s;elf from the
imputed guilt, of which Mr. Ha&s;tings had been anxious to
give to the Board more than fell to their &s;hare.</P>
<P>The tyranny of Mr. Ha&s;tings, he &s;aid, was not to be
reconciled to the common rules, nor could it be judged of
by the common &s;tandard of tyrants. The atrocious cruelties
of a Nero and a Caligula might be a&s;cribed to the impetu|o&s;ity
of pa&s;&s;ions inflamed to madne&s;s, which knew no check,
and which felt no correction. In their delirious career, they
&s;uffered no reflection to intervene, and they knew of no re|&s;pon&s;ibility
&mdash;they had no interval of remor&s;e, no feeling of
equality&mdash;they were born to rule, and they con&s;idered their
&s;ubjects as creatures over whom they had a right to domineer.
That &s;uch men, with turbulent, head-&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hould
be tyrants, was not &s;o wonderful as it was melancholy. But
how different was the ca&s;e of Mr. Ha&s;tings. He was a cool-thinking,
<PB N="57" REF="55">
deliberate tyrant. Born to no rule&mdash;entitled to
no &s;uperiority&mdash;accu&s;tomed to conver&s;e, to act, and to live
with his equals&mdash;bred in mercantile habits, which forced
him to e&s;timate on every mea&s;ure&mdash;and entru&s;ted by a mer|cantile
Company with a government which was to be carried
on by mercantile principles&mdash;Bound to give a faithful ac|count
of every tran&s;action&mdash;and to expo&s;e not only the mea|&s;ure
it&s;elf, but the motives that led to it&mdash;Who could never
go to bed without di&s;charging this duty&mdash;without balancing
the tran&s;actions of the day&mdash;and reconciling his acts to ju&s;tice
and policy&mdash;Who held up, as it were, a gla&s;s rightly to his
own con&s;cience, and was bound to purge it. That &s;uch a
man &s;hould become a tyrant, militated again&s;t every rational
principle of man.&mdash;Yet here we &s;aw the mon&s;ter&mdash;a philo&s;o|phical
tyrant&mdash;a cool, deliberate, rea&s;oning tyrant&mdash;who
violated the rights of man, with a perfect con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
what tho&s;e rights were&mdash;and who, endowed with the know|ledge
of the equal rank, as to freedom, granted by the Deity
to human kind, arraigned the wi&s;dom of Providence, by
oppo&s;ing its di&s;pen&s;ations in favour of his &s;pecies. A tyrant
again&s;t man was a libeller of God&mdash;and the Court beheld in
the pri&s;oner a creature who had pre&s;umed to deface and di&s;|order
the beauty and harmony of that &s;y&s;tem which was
originally granted by Heaven for the happine&s;s of the
earth.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan now drew to his conclu&s;ion. He &s;aid, their
Lord&s;hips would not be &s;urprized, if, after all that they had
heard, he &s;hould think the cau&s;e for which he &s;tood up per|fectly
&s;afe, if he called on them to di&s;charge from their
minds all that they had heard of mere language, and only
to attend to facts. A &s;trict examination of the evidence
would &s;o fully and thoroughly convince them of the turpi|tude
of the pri&s;oner, that he wi&s;hed to place the whole cau&s;e
on that &s;ingle ground, unornamented by eloquence, and
una&s;&s;i&s;ted by rea&s;oning. One only pa&s;&s;age more he &s;hould
take notice of.&mdash;Mr. Ha&s;tings, in the moment when he
<PB N="58" REF="56">
&s;tifled the pretended enquiry into the atrocious acts com|mitted
under his own authority, entered a minute of the
mo&s;t remarkable kind:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">If we cannot heal, let us not
inflame the wounds which have been inflicted. If the
Begums think them&s;elves aggrieved to &s;uch a degree as
to ju&s;tify them in an appeal to a foreign juri&s;diction,&mdash;</Q>
&s;peaking of wounds inflicted by his own po&s;itive orders&mdash;and
talking of a foreign juri&s;diction, as if Sir Elijah Impey's
Court at Lucknow had not been a foreign juri&s;diction,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">let us at lea&s;t permit them to be the judges of their own
feelings, and prefer their complaints before we offer to
redre&s;s them.&mdash;</Q>But now came the magnificent paragraph,
to which he reque&s;ted their Lord&s;hips attention:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">I hope
I &s;hall not depart from the &s;implicity of official language,
in &s;aying, the maje&s;ty of Ju&s;tice ought to be approached
with &s;olicitation, not de&s;cend to provoke or invite it,
much le&s;s to deba&s;e it&s;elf by the &s;ugge&s;tion of wrongs,
and the promi&s;e of redre&s;s, with the denunciation of pu|ni&s;hments,
before trial, and even before accu&s;ation.&mdash;</Q>
This &s;trutting and pompous apology for not li&s;tening to the
voice of real ju&s;tice and mercy, he was very much &s;urpri&s;ed
to find had met the approbation of Sir John Macpher&s;on, of
who&s;e good &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding he had heard a good
report, but who, by the minute which he added, proved
that he had not &s;tudied and corrected his ta&s;te for the &s;ub|lime
and beautiful from the immortal leader of this pro&s;e|cution.
If he dad done &s;o, he would have felt and treated
this pa&s;&s;age as it de&s;erved&mdash;as a piece of bomba&s;tic jargon,
unworthy of the &s;ober approbation of the under&s;tanding.
The Maje&s;ty of Ju&s;tice, in the eyes of Mr. Ha&s;tings, was a
being of terrific horror&mdash;a dreadful idol placed in the gloom
of graves, acce&s;&s;ible only to cringing &s;upplication, and
which mu&s;t be approached with offerings, and wor&s;hipped
by &s;acrifice. The maje&s;ty of Mr. Ha&s;tings was a being
who&s;e decrees were written with blood, and who&s;e oracles
were at once ob&s;cure and terrible. From &s;uch an idol (ex|claims
<PB N="59" REF="57">
Mr. Sheridan) I turn my eyes with horror&mdash;I turn
them here to this dignified and high tribunal, where the
Maje&s;ty of Ju&s;tice really &s;its enthroned.&mdash;Here I perceive
the Maje&s;ty of Ju&s;tice in her proper robes of truth and
mercy&mdash;cha&s;te and &s;imple&mdash;acce&s;&s;ible and patient&mdash;awful
without &s;everity&mdash;inqui&s;itive without meanne&s;s.&mdash;I &s;ee her
enthroned and &s;itting in judgment on a great and momentous
cau&s;e, in which the happine&s;s of millions is involved.&mdash;
Pardon me, my Lords, if I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that in the de|ci&s;ion
of this great cau&s;e you are to be envied, as well as
venerated. You po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t di&s;tinction of the human
character; for when you render your ultimate voice on this
cau&s;e, illu&s;trating the dignity of the ance&s;tors from whom
you &s;pring&mdash;ju&s;tifying the &s;olemn a&s;&s;everation which you
make&mdash;vindicating the people of whom you are a part&mdash;and
manife&s;ting the intelligence of the times in which you live&mdash;
you will do &s;uch an act of mercy and ble&s;&s;ing to man, as no
men but your&s;elves are able to grant.</P>
