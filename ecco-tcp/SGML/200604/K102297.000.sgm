<HEAD>A TRUE CHARACTER of Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Have read over the <HI>Libel,</HI> which I received from you the Day before Ye&s;terday. Ye&s;ter|day I received the &s;ame from another Hand, with this Character of the Secret Author of &s;o much &s;tupid Calumny.</P>
<P>That he is one, whom God and Nature have mark'd for want of Common Hone&s;ty, and his own Contemptible Rhimes for want of Common Sen&s;e, that tho&s;e Rhimes have found great Succe&s;s with the Rabble, which is a Word almo&s;t as comprehen&s;ive as Mankind; but that the Town, which &s;up|ports him, will do by him, as the Dolphin did by the Ship|wrack'd <HI>Monkey,</HI> drop him as &s;oon as it finds him out to be a Bea&s;t, whom it fondly now mi&s;takes for a Human Creature. 'Tis, &s;ays he, a very little, but very comprehen&s;ive Creature, in whom all Contradictions meet, and all Contrarieties are reconcil'd; when at one and the &s;ame time, like the Ancient <HI>Centaurs,</HI> he is a Bea&s;t and a Man, a Whig and a Tory, a vi|rulent <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and yet for&s;ooth, a Pillar of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> a Writer at one and the &s;ame time, of GUARDIANS and of EXAMINERS, an a&s;&s;ertor of Liberty and of the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power of Kings; a Rhime&s;ter without Judgment or Rea&s;on, and a Critick without Common Sen&s;e; a Je&s;uiti|cal
<PB N="2" REF="2">
Profe&s;&s;or of Truth, a ba&s;e and foul Pretender to Candour; a Barbarous Wretch, who is perpetually boa&s;ting of Huma|nity and Good Nature, a lurking way-laying Coward, and a Stabber in the Dark; who is always pretending to Magnani|mity, and to &s;um up all Villains in one, a Traytor-Friend, one who has betrayed all Mankind, and &s;eems to have taken his great Rule of Life from the following Lines of <HI>Hudibras.</HI></P>
<Q><L>For 'tis ea&s;ier to <HI>Betray</HI></L>
<L>Than Ruin any other way,</L>
<L>As the Earth is &s;oone&s;t undermin'd,</L>
<L>By vermin Impotent and Blind.</L></Q>
<P>He is a Profe&s;&s;or of the wor&s;t Religion, which he laughs at, and yet has mo&s;t inviolably ob&s;erv'd the mo&s;t execrable Maxim in it, <HI>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks.</HI> A Wretch, who&s;e true Religion is his Intere&s;t, and yet &s;o &s;tu|pidly blind to that Intere&s;t, that he often meets her, without knowing her, and very gro&s;ly Affronts her. His Villainy is but the natural Effect of his want of Under&s;tanding, as the &s;owerne&s;s of Vinegar proceeds from its want of Spirit; and yet, <HI>&s;ays my Friend,</HI> notwith&s;tanding that Shape and that Mind of his, &s;ome Men of good Under&s;tanding, value him for his Rhimes, as they would be fond of an <HI>A&s;&s;einego,</HI> that could &s;ing his part in a Catch, or of a <HI>Baboon</HI> that could whi&s;tle <HI>Wal&s;ingham.</HI> The gro&s;&s;er part of his gentle Readers be+lieve the Bea&s;t to be more than Man; as Ancient Ru&s;ticks took his Ance&s;tors for tho&s;e Demy Gods they call <HI>Fauns</HI> and <HI>Satyrs.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Character, which my Friend gave of the Au|thor of this mi&s;erable Libel, which immediately made me ap|prehend that it was the very &s;ame Per&s;on, who endeavour'd to expo&s;e you in a <HI>Billin&s;gate</HI> Libel, at the very time that you were doing him a Favour at his own earne&s;t De&s;ire, who attempted to undermine Mr. <HI>PHILIPS</HI> in one of his <HI>Guardians,</HI> at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Crocodile</HI> &s;mil'd on him, embrac'd him, and called him Friend, who wrote a Prologue in prai&s;e of <HI>CATO,</HI> and teas'd <HI>Lintott</HI> to publi&s;h Remarks upon it; who at the &s;ame time, that he openly extoll'd Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> in the highe&s;t manner, &s;ecretly publi&s;h'd the Infamous Libel of Dr. <HI>Andrew Tripe</HI> upon him; who, as he is in Shape a <HI>Monkey,</HI> is &s;o in his every Action; in his &s;en&s;ele&s;s Chattering, and his merry
<PB N="3" REF="3">
Grimaces, in his doing hourly Mi&s;chief and hiding him&s;elf in the variety of his Ridiculous Po&s;tures, and his continual Shiftings, from Place to Place, from Per&s;ons to Per&s;ons, from Thing to Thing. But whenever he Scribbles, he is emphatically a <HI>Monkey,</HI> in his awkard &s;ervile Imitations. For in all his Productions, he has been an <HI>Imitator,</HI> from his Imitation of VIRGILS <HI>Bucolicks,</HI> to this pre&s;ent Imitation of HORACE.&mdash;His <HI>Pa&s;torals</HI> were writ in Imitation of VIR|GIL,&mdash;His <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> of BOILEAU,&mdash;His <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Cri|tici&s;m,</HI> of the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and of my Lord <HI>Rofcommon.</HI>&mdash;His <HI>Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t</HI> of Sir <HI>John Denham,</HI>&mdash;His <HI>Ode upon St. Caecilia</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> and&mdash;His <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> of CHAUCER.</P>
<P>Thus for fifteen Years together this Ludicrous Animal has been a con&s;tant <HI>Imitator.</HI> Yet he has rather mimick'd the&s;e great Genius's, than he has Imitated them. He has given a Fal&s;e and a Ridiculous Turn to all their good and their great Qualities, and has, as far as in him lies, Burle&s;qu'd them with|out knowing it. But after having been for fifteen Years as it were an <HI>Imitator,</HI> he has made no Proficiency. His fir&s;t Imita|tions, tho' bad, are rather better than the Succeeding, and this la&s;t Imitation of HORACE, the mo&s;t execrable of them all.</P>
<Q><L>For as a Dog that turns the Spit,</L>
<L>Be&s;tirs him&s;elf and plies his Feet</L>
<L>To climb the Wheel, but all in vain,</L>
<L>His own Weight brings him down again,</L>
<L>And &s;till he's in the &s;elf &s;ame place,</L>
<L>Where at his &s;etting out he was,</L>
<L>So in the Circle of the Arts,</L>
<L>Does he Advance his natural Parts.</L>
<BIBL>Hud.</BIBL></Q>
<P>If you &s;hould chance, Sir, to &s;hew this LETTER to any of your Acquaintance who have perus'd his Sen&s;ele&s;s Calum|nies, they may think perhaps that we follow his Example, and retort Slander upon him. I de&s;ire that you would have the Goodne&s;s to a&s;&s;ure &s;uch, that in the Moral part of his Character, and all that relates to matter of Fact, there is no manner of Rhetorick us'd, all is exactly and literally true,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
for which we appeal to tho&s;e Poetical Per&s;ons, with whom we have been mo&s;t conver&s;ant in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> We have always been of Opinion that he who invents, or pretends, or fal&s;ifies Matter of Fact, in order to &s;lander any one, de&s;erves an In|famous Puni&s;hment, and we have always had before our Eyes the following Ver&s;es out of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Ab&s;entem qui rodit amicum,</L>
<L>Qui non de&s;endit alio culpante, &s;olutos</L>
<L>Qui captat ri&s;us Hominum, famamque dicacis,</L>
<L>Fingere qui non vi&s;a pote&s;t, commi&s;&s;a tacere,</L>
<L>Qui nequit, hic niger e&s;t, hunc tu Romani.</L>
<BIBL>Caveto, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>As to what relates to the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of this wretched Libeller, if in that there may be &s;ome trifling Exaggerations, yet even that is not de&s;ign'd to Deceive or Impo&s;e upon any to whom you mey happen to &s;hew it, but is intended to lead them to an exact Knowledge of the Truth by a very little enlarging upon it.</P>
<P>But if any one appears to be concern'd at our upbraiding him with his Natural Deformity, which did not come by his own Fault, but &s;eems to be the Cur&s;e of God upon him; we de&s;ire that Per&s;on to con&s;ider, that this little Mon&s;ter has up|braided People with their Calamities and their Di&s;ea&s;es which are either fal&s;e or pa&s;t, or which he him&s;elf gave them by admini&s;tring Poi&s;on to them; we de&s;ire that Per&s;on to con&s;ider that Calamities and Di&s;ea&s;es, if they are neither fal&s;e nor pa&s;t, are common to all Men; that a Man can no more help his Calamities and his Di&s;ea&s;es, than a Mon&s;ter can his De|formity; that there is no Misfortune, but what the Genera|lity of Mankind are liable too; and that there is no one Di&s;|ea&s;e, but what all the re&s;t of Men are &s;ubject too; whereas the Deformity of this Libeller is Vi&s;ible, Pre&s;ent, La&s;ting, Unalterable, and Peculiar to him&s;elf. 'Tis the mark of God and Nature upon him, to give us warning that we &s;hould hold no Society with him, as a Creature not of our Original, nor of our Species. And they who have refus'd to take this Warning which God and Nature have given them, and have in &s;pight of it, by a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Pre&s;umption, ventur'd to be fa|miliar
<PB N="5" REF="5">
with him, have &s;everely &s;uffer'd for it, by his Perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s. They tell me, he has been lately pleas'd to &s;ay, <HI>That 'tis Doubtful if the Race of Men are the offspring of</HI> Adam <HI>or of the</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The WORMS a Satire, Stanza 4.</NOTE> Devil. But if 'tis doubtful as to the Race of Men, 'tis cer|tain at lea&s;t, that his Original is not from <HI>Adam,</HI> but from the <HI>Devil.</HI> By his con&s;tant and malicious Lying, and by that Angel Face and Form of his, 'tis plain that he wants nothing but Horns and Tail, to be the exact Re&s;emblance, both in Shape and Mind, of his Infernal Father. Thus, Sir, I return you Truth for Slander, and a ju&s;t Satire for an Extravagant Libel, which is therefore ridiculou&s;ly called an Imitation of <HI>Horace,</HI> you know very well, Sir, that the Difference between <HI>Horace,</HI> and &s;uch an Imitation of him, is almo&s;t Infinite; and I leave you to con&s;ider what Influence &s;uch an Imita|tion mu&s;t have upon his Readers of both Kinds, both upon tho&s;e who are acquainted with that Great Poet, and with tho&s;e that know him not; how contemptible it mu&s;t render <HI>Horace</HI> to the latter, and his Imitator to the former, who when they &s;hall behold the Gho&s;t of their old and their valu|ed Friend, rai&s;ed up before them, by this awkard Conjurer, in a Manner &s;o ridiculou&s;ly frightful, when they behold him thus mi&s;erably mangled, and reflect at once with Contempt and Horrour, upon this Barbarous U&s;age of him, will not be able to refrain from exclaiming in the mo&s;t vehement Manner.</P>
<Q><L>Qualis ade&s;t, Quantum mutatus ab illo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>They mu&s;t think that their old and valued Friend had a Prophetick Spirit, and &s;eem'd to foretel the U&s;age, which he has lately received from this Barbarian and his Brethren, when in the fourth Ode of his Third Book he cryed,</P>
<Q><L>Vi&s;am Britannos Ho&s;pitibus feros.</L></Q>
<P>But as for the other &s;orts of Readers, the Readers who have no knowledge of <HI>Horace,</HI> but from this contemptible Imitati|on; what mu&s;t they think, Sir, of tho&s;e great Men, who ex|tol him, for the &s;econd Genius of the <HI>Roman-Empire,</HI> Illu&s;tri|ous for &s;o many great Qualities which are to be &s;ound in him
<PB N="6" REF="6">
alone. Mu&s;t they not look upon all his Admirers, as &s;o ma|ny Learned Ideots, and upon the <HI>Roman-Empire</HI> it &s;elf, as a va&s;t Nation of Fools.</P>
<P>You know very well, Sir, that as <HI>Horace</HI> had a firmne&s;s of Judgment, and a &s;urene&s;s and truth of Ta&s;te; he never once form'd a wrong Judgment to him&s;elf, either of the Actions of Men in general, or of the particular Worth and Merit of Authors; he had an Honour and a Rectitude of Soul, that would have oblig'd him to die a thou&s;and times rather than to Write any thing again&s;t his Con&s;cience.</P>
<Q><L>Pejuque letho flagitium timet.</L></Q>
<P>He was capable indeed of being provok'd to expo&s;e either a Fool or a Knave, whom otherwi&s;e he might have &s;uffer'd to have remain'd in Ob&s;curity; but the mo&s;t barbarous U&s;age of his mo&s;t Malicious Enemy, could never urge him to &s;lan|der that Enemy. From this Force and Clearne&s;s of his Un|der&s;tanding, and this Noble Rectitude of his Will, it has pro|ceeded that all his Cen&s;ures are like &s;o many <HI>Decrees,</HI> that have been all affirm'd by Po&s;terity, the only Supream Court of Judicature, for the Di&s;tribution of Fame and Infamy, from which Mankind can have no Appeal. That Supream, Impartial, Incorruptible Judicature, has the &s;ame Opinions of Per&s;ons and Things, and e&s;pecially of Authors that he had. The &s;ame high Value for <HI>Tibullus,</HI> for <HI>Pollio,</HI> for <HI>Varius,</HI> for <HI>Virgil</HI>; and the &s;ame Contempt for <HI>Bavius,</HI> for <HI>Maevius,</HI> for <HI>Cri|&s;pinus,</HI> for <HI>Alpinus,</HI> for <HI>Fannius,</HI> and for a Thou&s;and more.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ju&s;tne&s;s and Finene&s;s of Di&s;cernment and the &s;ame noble Rectitude of will, appear in the <HI>French Satiri&s;t,</HI> which make the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Share of his Merit, and the mo&s;t Di&s;tingui&s;hing part of his Character, if we will believe what he &s;ays of him&s;elf, in his Admirable Epi&s;tle to <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> SEIGNELEY. You know, Sir, that what <HI>Boileau</HI> &s;ays there of him&s;elf is exactly true in Fact. The Per&s;ons whom he has attack'd in his Writings have been for the mo&s;t part Authors and mo&s;t of tho&s;e Authors Poets. The Cen&s;ures which he has pa&s;s'd on them have been confirm'd by all <HI>Europe.</HI> But at the &s;ame time that judicious Poet, has been as liberal of his Prai&s;e to his Contemporaries, who were excellent in their Kinds, as <HI>Corneille, Racine, Moliere,</HI> and <HI>La Fontaine</HI>; Nay, he
<PB N="7" REF="7">
was generous enough to defend <HI>Racine,</HI> and to &s;upport and &s;trengthen him, when a Clamorous croud of mi&s;erable Au|thors endeavoured to oppre&s;s him, as appears by his Admirable Epi&s;tle addre&s;t to that Tragick Poet.</P>
<P>You, and I, both know very well, Sir, that there has been never wanting a Floud of &s;uch Authors, neither in <HI>England</HI> nor <HI>France,</HI> who being like this Imitator, in ev'ry Re&s;pect, the rever&s;e of <HI>Horace,</HI> in Honour, in Di&s;cernment, in Genius; have always combin'd to atack any thing that has apear'd above their own dull Level, while they have hug'd and admir'd each other, Authors who have thought to be too hard for their Adver&s;aries by oppo&s;ing <HI>Billin&s;gate</HI> to Rea&s;on, and Dogmatical A&s;&s;ertion to Moral Demon&s;tration; and who have been Ideots enough to belive that their Noi&s;e and Impudence could alter the Nature of Things, and the Notions of Men of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e Libellers, the pre&s;ent Imitator is the mo&s;t Im|pudent, and the mo&s;t Incorrigible, who has lately pe&s;ter'd and plagued the World with Five or Six Scandalous Libels in Pro&s;e, that are all of them at once &s;o &s;tupid and &s;o Ma|licious, that Men of Sence are Doubtful, if they &s;hould at|tribute them to the Libellers Native Idioti&s;m or to Acci|dental Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Libels, the chief Objects of his Scandal and Malice, have been Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;h'd Merit and among the&s;e he has fallen upon none &s;o foully as his Friends and Benefactors. Among the&s;e latter, he has attack'd no one &s;o often, or with &s;o much ridiculous, impotent Mallice, as Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>; who is E&s;timable for a thou&s;and good and great Qualities. And what time has he cho&s;en to do this. Why ju&s;t after that Gentelman had laid very great Oblega|tions on him; and ju&s;t after he had oblig'd the World with, &s;o many Editions of his Excellent <HI>Poem</HI> upon CREATION, which <HI>Poem</HI> alone is worth all the <HI>Folios,</HI> that this Libeller will ever write and which will render its Author the Delight and Admiration of Po&s;terity. So that 'tis hard to deter|mine whether this Libeller is more remarkable for his Judg|ment or his Gratitude.</P>
<P>I dare venture to affirm, that there is not an Author living &s;o little Qualified for a Cen&s;urer as him&s;elf. I know nothing for which he is &s;o ill Qualified as he is for Judg|ing
<PB N="8" REF="8">
unle&s;s it be for Tran&s;lating HOMER. He has neither Ta&s;te nor judgment, but is, if you will pardon a Quibble, the very nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI>; for he has none of the Poetical Laws; or if he has the Letter of any, He has it without the Spirit. Whenever he pretends to Critici&s;e, I fancy I &s;ee <HI>Sham|well</HI> or <HI>Cheatly</HI> in the Squire of <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> cutting a Sham or Banter to abu&s;e &s;ome Bubble. The <HI>Pre&s;ace</HI> is full of gro&s;s Er|rours, and he has &s;hewn him&s;elf in it, a Dogmatical, Ignorant Impudent Second Hand Critick. As for the <HI>Poem,</HI> however he may cry up HOMER for being every where a <HI>Graecian</HI>&mdash;<HI>Trumpeter</HI> in the Original, I can &s;ee no <HI>Trumpeter</HI> in the <HI>Tran&s;lator,</HI> but the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s. But &s;ince his Friends will alledge 'tis ea&s;ie to &s;ay this, I de&s;ire it may go for nothing till I have &s;o plainly prov'd it, that the mo&s;t Fooli&s;h, and the mo&s;t Partial of them &s;hall not be able to deny it.</P>
<P>As for what they call his <HI>Ver&s;es,</HI> he has, like Mr. <HI>Bayes,</HI> got a notable knack of Rhiming and Writing &s;mooth ver&s;e, but without either Genius or Good Sen&s;e, or any tolerable Knowledge of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as I believe I &s;hall &s;hew plainly, when I come to the re&s;t of his Imitations. As for his Tran&s;lation of <HI>HOMER,</HI> I could never borrow it till this very Day, and de|&s;ign to read it over to Morrow; &s;o that &s;hortly you may ex|pect to hear more of it. I will only tell you beforehand, that <HI>HOMER</HI> &s;eems to me to be untran&s;latable in any Modern Language. That great Poet is ju&s;t in his De&s;ings, admirable in his Characters, and for the mo&s;t part exact in his Rea|&s;oning and correct in his Noble Sentiments; but the&s;e are Ex|cellencies, which may be already &s;een in the Pro&s;e Tran&s;lati|ons of Him.</P>
<P>The Qualities which &s;o admirably di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>HOMER</HI> from mo&s;t other Writers, and which therefore a Tran&s;lator in Ver&s;e is particularly oblig'd to &s;how, becau&s;e they cannot be &s;hown in Pro&s;e, are the Beauty of his Diction, and the va|rious Harmony of his Ver&s;ification. But 'tis as Ridiculous to pretend to make the&s;e Shine out in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rhimes, as it would be to Emulate upon a <HI>Bag-pipe,</HI> the Solemn and Ma|je&s;tick Thorough Ba&s;&s;e of an <HI>Organ.</HI></P>
<P>But you may &s;uddenly expect more of this, if what I have already &s;aid, happens to entertain you.</P>
