<P>BE not &s;tartled, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> to find your&s;elves addre&s;&s;ed to by one of a different Communion. We are indeed (to our Shame be it &s;poken) more inclined to hate for tho&s;e Articles, wherein we differ, than to love one an|other for tho&s;e wherein we agree. But if we cannot extingui&s;h, let us at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend our Animo&s;ities, and forgetting our religious Feuds, con&s;ider our&s;elves in the amiable Light of Countrymen and Neighbours. Let us for once turn our Eyes on tho&s;e Things, in which we have one common Intere&s;t. Why &s;hould Di&s;putes about Faith interrupt the Du|ties of civil Life? or the different Roads we take to Heaven prevent our taking the &s;ame Steps on Earth? do we not inhabit the &s;ame Spot of Ground, breath the &s;ame Air, and live under the &s;ame Go|vernment?
<PB N="4" REF="3">
why then &s;hould we not con&s;pire in one and the &s;ame De&s;ign, to promote the common Good of our Country?</P>
<P>We are all agreed about the U&s;eful|ne&s;s of Meat, Drink, and Clothes, and without Doubt, we all &s;incerely wi&s;h our poor Neighbours were better &s;up|plied with them. Providence and Na|ture have done their Part; no Country is better qualified to furni&s;h the Nece&s;&s;a|ries of Life, and yet no People are wor&s;e provided. In vain is the Earth fertile, and the Climate benign, if hu|man Labour be wanting. Nature &s;up|plies the Materials, which Art and In|du&s;try improve to the U&s;e of Man, and it is the Want of this Indu&s;try that oc|ca&s;ions all our other Wants.</P>
<P>The Public hath endeavoured to ex|cite and encourage this mo&s;t u&s;eful Vir|tue. Much hath been done; but whe|ther it be from the Heavine&s;s of the Cli|mate, or from the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Scythian</HI> Blood that runs in their Veins, or what|ever el&s;e may be the Cau&s;e, there &s;till re|mains

in the Natives of this I&s;land a re|markable Antipathy to Labour. You, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> can alone conquer their innate hereditary Sloth. Do you then, as you love your Country exert your&s;elves.</P>
<P>You are known to have great In|fluence on the Minds of your People, be &s;o good as to u&s;e this Influence for their Benefit. Since other Methods fail, try what <HI>you</HI> can do. <HI>Be in&s;tant in Sea|&s;on, out of Sea&s;on, reprove, rebuke, ex|hort.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. <HI>ch.</HI> iv. <HI>ver.</HI> 2.</NOTE> Make them thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the Sin and Folly of Sloth.

Give me Leave to tell you, that no Set of Men upon Earth have it in their Power to do good on ea&s;ier Terms, with more Advantage to others, and le&s;s Pains or Lo&s;s to them&s;elves.

They are encouraged in this vagabond Life by the mi&s;erable Ho&s;pitality they meet with in every Cottage, who&s;e In|habitants expect the &s;ame kind Recep|tion in their Turn, when they become Beggars them&s;elves; Beggary being the

<P>But whatever is &s;aid mu&s;t be &s;o taken, as not to reflect on Per&s;ons of Rank and Education, who are no Way inferior to their Neighbours; nor yet to include all even of the lowe&s;t Sort, though it may well extend to the Generality, of tho&s;e e&s;pecially in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Parts of the Kingdom, where the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Manners have le&s;s prevailed.

Having long ob&s;erved and bewailed this wretched State of my Countrymen, and the In&s;ufficiency of &s;everal Methods &s;et on Foot to reclaim them; I have re|cour&s;e to <HI>your Reverences,</HI> as the <HI>dernier Re&s;ort.</HI> Make them to under&s;tand that you have their Intere&s;t at Heart, that you per&s;uade them to work for their own Sakes, and that GOD hath ordered Matters &s;o as that, they who will not work for them&s;elves, mu&s;t work for others.

<P>A &s;lothful Man's Imagination is apt to dre&s;s up Labour in a horrible Ma&s;que; but, horrible as it is, Idlene&s;s is more to be dreaded, and a Life of Poverty (its nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence) is far more painful. It was the Advice of <HI>Pythago|ras, to chu&s;e the be&s;t Kind of Life,</HI> for that U&s;e would render it agreeable, re|conciling Men even to the roughe&s;t Ex|erci&s;e. By Practice, Pains become at fir&s;t ea&s;ie, and in the Progre&s;s plea&s;ant; and this is &s;o true, that whoever exa|mines Things will find, there can be no &s;uch Thing as a happy Life without La|bour, and that whoever doth not labour with his Hands, mu&s;t in his own Defence labour with his Brains.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
Certainly, planting and tilling the Earth is an Exerci&s;e not le&s;s plea&s;ing than u&s;eful; it takes the Pea&s;ant from his &s;moaky Cabin into the fre&s;h Air and the open Field, rendering his Lot far more de&s;irable than that of the Slug|gard, who lies in the Straw, or &s;its whole Days by the Fire.</P>
<P>Convince your People that not only Plea&s;ure invites, but Nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o drives them to labour. If you have any Compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e poor Creatures, put them in Mind how many of them peri&s;hed in a late memorable Di&s;tre&s;s, through Want of that provident Care again&s;t a hard Sea&s;on, ob&s;ervable not only in all other Men, but even in irra|tional Animals. Set before their Eyes in lively Colours, their own indigent and &s;ordid Lives, compared with tho&s;e of other People, who&s;e Indu&s;try hath procured them hearty Food, warm Clothes, and decent Dwellings. Make them &s;en&s;ible what a Reproach it is, that a Nation which makes &s;o great Preten|&s;ions
<PB N="13" REF="12">
to Antiquity, and is &s;aid to have flouri&s;hed many Ages &aacute;go in Arts and Learning, &s;hould in the&s;e our Days turn out a lazy, de&s;titute, and degenerate Race.</P>
<P>Rai&s;e your Voices, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> exert your Influence, &s;hew your Autho|rity over the Multitude, by engaging them to the Practice of an hone&s;t In|du&s;try, a Duty nece&s;&s;ary to all, and required in all, whether <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> whether <HI>Chri&s;tians, Jews,</HI> or <HI>Pagans.</HI> Be &s;o good among other Points to find Room for <HI>This,</HI> than which none is of more Concern to the Souls and Bodies of your Hearers, nor con&s;equently de&s;erves to be more am|ply, or frequently in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>Many and obvious are the Motives that recommend this Duty. Upon a Subject &s;o copious you can never be at a Lo&s;s for &s;omething to &s;ay. And while by the&s;e Means you re&s;cue your Coun|trymen from Want and Mi&s;ery, you will have the Satisfaction to behold your
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Country it&s;elf improved. What Plea|&s;ure mu&s;t it give you to &s;ee the&s;e wa&s;te and wild Scenes, the&s;e naked Ditches and mi&s;erable Hovels exchanged for fine Plantations, rich Meadows, well tilled Fields, and neat Dwellings; to &s;ee People well fed and well clad, in|&s;tead of fami&s;hed, ragged Scarecrows; and tho&s;e very Per&s;ons tilling the Fields that u&s;ed to beg in the Streets.</P>
<P>Neither ought the Difficulty of the Enterpri&s;e to frighten you from attempt|ing it. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed a Habit of Indu&s;try is not at once introduced; Neighbour neverthele&s;s will emulate Neighbour, and the Contagion of good Example will &s;pread as &s;urely as of bad, though perhaps not &s;o &s;peedily. It may be hoped, there are many that would be allured by a plentiful and decent Manner of Life to take Pains, e&s;pecially when they ob&s;erve it to be attained by the Indu&s;try of their Neighbours, in no Sort better qualified than them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
If the &s;ame gentle Spirit of Sloth did not &s;ooth our Squires as well as Pea&s;ants, one would imagine there &s;hould be no idle Hands among us. Alas! how many Incentives to Indu&s;try offer them&s;elves in this I&s;land, crying aloud to the Inhabitants for Work? Roads to be repaired, Rivers made na|vigable, Fi&s;heries on the Coa&s;ts, Mines to be wrought, Plantations to be rai&s;ed, Manufactures improved, and, above all, Lands to be tilled and &s;owed with all Sorts of Grain.</P>
<P>When &s;o many Circum&s;tances pro|voke and animate your People to La|bour, when their private Wants, and the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Public, when the Laws, the Magi&s;trates, and the very Country calls upon them, you cannot think it becomes you alone to be &s;ilent, or hindmo&s;t in every Project for pro|moting the public Good. Why &s;hould you, who&s;e Influence is greate&s;t, be lea&s;t active? why &s;hould you, who&s;e Words
<PB N="16" REF="15">
are mo&s;t likely to prevail, &s;ay lea&s;t in the common Cau&s;e?</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be &s;aid, the Di&s;cou|ragements attending tho&s;e of your Com|munion are a Bar again&s;t all Endeavours for exciting them to a laudable Indu&s;|try. Men are &s;tirred up to Labour by the Pro&s;pect of bettering their Fortunes, by getting E&s;tates, or Employments; but tho&s;e who are limited in the Pur|cha&s;e of E&s;tates, and excluded from all civil Employments, are deprived of tho&s;e Spurs to Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered, that ad|mitting the&s;e Con&s;iderations do, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, damp Indu&s;try and Ambition in Per&s;ons of a certain Rank, yet they can be no Let to the Indu&s;try of poor People, or &s;upply an Argument again&s;t endeavouring to procure Meat, Drink, and Clothes. It is not propo&s;ed, that you &s;hould per&s;uade the better Sort to acquire E&s;tates, or qualify them&s;elves for becoming Magi&s;trates; but only that you &s;hould &s;et the lowe&s;t of the
<PB N="17" REF="16">
People at Work, to provide them&s;elves with Nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;upply the Wants of Nature.</P>
<P>It will be alledged in Excu&s;e of their Idlene&s;s, that the Country People want Encouragement to labour, as not have|ing a Property in the Lands. There is &s;mall Encouragement, &s;ay you, for them to build, or plant upon another's Land, wherein they have only a temporary In|tere&s;t. To which I an&s;wer, that Life it&s;elf is but temporary; that all Tenures are not of the &s;ame Kind; that the Ca&s;e of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the original <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> is equal in this Re&s;pect; and that the true <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or natural <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are noted for Want of Indu&s;try in Improving even on their own Lands, whereof they have both Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Property.</P>
<P>How many indu&s;trious Per&s;ons are there in all civilized Countries, without any Property in Lands, or any Pro&s;pect of E&s;tates, or Employments? Indu&s;try never fails to reward her Votaries.
<PB N="18" REF="17">
There is no one but can earn a little, and little added to little makes a Heap. In this fertile and plentiful I&s;land, none can peri&s;h for Want but the Idle and Improvident. None who have Indu&s;try, Frugality, and Fore&s;ight but may get into tolerable, if not wealthy Circum|&s;tances. Are not all Trades and Manu|factures open to tho&s;e of your Commu|nion? have you not the &s;ame free U&s;e, and may you not make the &s;ame Advan|tage of Fairs and Markets as other Men? do you pay higher Duties, or are you liable to greater Impo&s;itions than your fellow Subjects? and are not the public Praemiums and Encouragements given indifferently to Arti&s;ts of all Commu|nions? have not, in Fact, tho&s;e of your Communion a very great Share of the Commerce of this Kingdom in their Hands? and is not more to be got by this than by purcha&s;ing E&s;tates, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing civil Employments, who&s;e Incomes are often attended with large Expences?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
A tight Hou&s;e, warm Apparel, and whole&s;ome Food are &s;ufficient Motives to labour. If all had them, we &s;hould be a flouri&s;hing Nation. And if tho&s;e who take Pains may have them, tho&s;e who will not take Pains are not to be pitied; they are to be looked on and treated as Drones, the Pe&s;t and Di&s;|grace of Society.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, the Hardne&s;s of the Landlord cramps the Indu&s;try of the Tenant. But if Rent be high, and the Landlord rigorous, there is more need of Indu&s;try in the Tenant. It is well known that in <HI>Holland,</HI> Taxes are much higher, and Rent both of Land and Hou&s;es far dearer than in <HI>Ireland.</HI> But this is no Objection or Impediment to the Indu&s;try of the People, who are ra|ther animated and &s;purred on to earn a Livelihood by Labour, that is not to be got without it.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, it is an ea&s;y Matter to make a plau&s;ible Di&s;cour&s;e on Indu&s;try,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and its Advantages; but what can be expected from poor Creatures, who are de&s;titute of all Conveniences for exerting their Indu&s;try, who have nothing to improve upon, nothing to begin the World with? I an&s;wer they have their four Quarters, and five Sen&s;es. Is it nothing to po&s;&s;e&s;s the bodily Organs &s;ound and entire? That wonderful Machine the Hand, was it formed to be idle?</P>
<P>Was there but Will to work, there are not wanting in this I&s;land either Op|portunities, or Encouragements. Spin|ning alone might employ all idle Hands, (Children as well as Parents) being &s;oon learned, ea&s;ily performed, and never failing of a Market, requiring neither Wit nor Strength, but &s;uited to all Ages and Capacities. The Public provides Uten&s;ils, and Per&s;ons for teaching the U&s;e of them; but the Public cannot provide a Heart and Will to be indu&s;tri|ous. The&s;e, I will not deny, may be found in &s;everal Per&s;ons in &s;ome other
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Parts of the Kingdom, and where-ever they are found, the comfortable Effects &s;hew them&s;elves. But &s;eldom, very &s;eldom are they found in the&s;e <HI>Southern</HI> People, who&s;e Indolence figureth a Lion in the Way, and is Proof again&s;t all En|couragement.</P>
<P>But you will in&s;i&s;t, how can a poor Man, who&s;e daily Labour goes for the Payment of his Rent, be able to provide pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;aries for his Family, much le&s;s to lay up a Store for the Future. It mu&s;t be owned, a con&s;iderable Share of the poor Man's Time and Labour goes towards paying his Rent. But how are his Wife and Children employed, or how doth he employ him&s;elf the re&s;t of his Time? the &s;ame Work tires, but different Works relieve. Where there is a true Spirit of Indu&s;try, there will never be wanting &s;omething to do, with|out Doors, or within, by Candle-light, if not by Day-light. <HI>Labor ip&s;e Volup|tas,</HI> &s;aith the Poet, and this is verified in Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
In <HI>England,</HI> when the Labour of the Field is over, it is u&s;ual for Men to be|take them&s;elves to &s;ome other Labour of a different Kind. In the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of that indu&s;trious Land, the Inhabitants meet, a jolly Crew, at one anothers Hou&s;es, where they merrily and frugally pa&s;s the long and dark Winter Evenings; &s;everal Families by the &s;ame Light, and the &s;ame Fire, working at their different Manufactures of Wool, Flax, or Hemp; Company mean while mutually cheering and provoking to labour. In certain o|ther <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">e. g. <HI>Newport Pagnel</HI> in <HI>Bucking|ham&s;hire.</HI></NOTE> Parts you may &s;ee, on a Sum|mer's Evening, the common Labourers &s;itting along the Street of a Town, or Village, each at his own Door, with a Cu&s;hion before him making Bone-lace, and earning more in an Evening's Pa&s;|time than an <HI>Iri&s;h Family</HI> would in a whole Day. Tho&s;e People in&s;tead of clo&s;ing the Day with a Game on grea&s;y Cards, or lying &s;tretched before the Fire,

<P>But admitting, for the various Rea|&s;ons above alledged, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for our Cottagers to be rich, yet it is certain they may be clean. Now bring them to be cleanly, and your Work is half done. A little wa&s;hing, &s;crubbing, and rubbing, be&s;towed on their Per&s;ons and Hou&s;es, would introduce a &s;ort of Indu&s;try, and Indu&s;try in any one Kind is apt to beget it in another.</P>
<P>Indolence in Dirt is a terrible Symp|tom, which &s;hews it&s;elf in our lower <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> more, perhaps, than in any Peo|ple on this Side the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> I will venture to add, that look through|out the Kingdom, and you &s;hall not find a clean Hou&s;e inhabited by clean Peo|ple, and yet wanting Nece&s;&s;aries; the &s;ame Spirit of Indu&s;try that keeps Folk clean, being &s;ufficient to keep them al&s;o in Food and Rayment.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
But alas! our poor <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are wedded to Dirt upon Principle. It is with &s;ome of them a Maxim, that the Way to make Children thrive is to keep them dirty. And I do verily believe, that the Familiarity with Dirt, contracted and nouri&s;hed from their Infancy, is one great Cau&s;e of that Sloth which attends them in every Stage of Life. Were Children but brought up in an Abhorrence of Dirt, and obliged to keep them&s;elves clean, they would have &s;omething to do, whereas they now do nothing.</P>
<P>It is pa&s;t all Doubt, that tho&s;e who are educated in a &s;upine Neglect of all Things, either profitable, or decent, mu&s;t needs contract a Sleepine&s;s and In|dolence, which doth nece&s;&s;arily lead to Poverty, and every other Di&s;tre&s;s that attends it. <HI>Love not Sleep,</HI> cries <HI>Solomon, le&s;t thou come to Poverty</HI>; <HI>open thine Eyes and thou &s;halt be &s;atisfied with Bread.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. <HI>ch.</HI> xx. <HI>ver.</HI> 13.</NOTE> It is therefore greatly to be wi&s;hed, that you would per&s;uade Parents, to inure their
<PB N="25" REF="24">
betimes to a Habit of Indu&s;try, as the &s;ure&s;t Way to &s;hun the Mi&s;eries that mu&s;t otherwi&s;e befal them.</P>
<P>An early Habit, whether of Sloth, or Diligence, will not fail to &s;hew it&s;elf throughout the whole Cour&s;e of a Man's Life. <HI>Train up a Child,</HI> &s;aith the <HI>Wi&s;e|man, in the Way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xxii. ver. 6.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t Tincture often leaves &s;o deep a Stain as no After-thought or Endeavour can wa&s;h out. Hence Sloth in &s;ome Minds is Proof again&s;t all Arguments and Ex|amples what&s;oever, all Motives of Inte|re&s;t and Duty, all Impre&s;&s;ions even of Cold and Hunger. This Habit rooted in the Child, grows up and adheres to the Man, producing a general Li&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s, and Aver&s;ion from Labour. This I take to be our great Calamity.</P>
<P>For admitting, that &s;ome of our Squires and Landlords are Vultures with Iron Bowels, and that their Hardne&s;s and Severity is a great Di&s;couragement
<PB N="26" REF="25">
to the Tenant who will naturally pre|fer Want and Ea&s;e, before Want and Toil; it mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time be ad|mitted, that neither is the Landlord, ge|nerally &s;peaking, &s;o hard, nor the Cli|mate &s;o &s;evere, nor the Soil &s;o ungrate|ful, as not to an&s;wer the Hu&s;bandman's Labour, where there is a Spirit of In|du&s;try; the Want of which is the true Cau&s;e of our national Di&s;tre&s;s. Of this there are many evident Proofs.</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf known a Man, from the lowe&s;t Condition of Life, without Friends or Education, not knowing &s;o much as to write or read, bred to no Trade or Calling, by pure dint of Day|labour, Frugality, and Fore&s;ight, to have grown wealthy, even in this I&s;land, and under all the abovementioned Di&s;|advantages. And what is done by one, is po&s;&s;ible to another.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland</HI> a Child five Years old is maintained by its own Labour; in <HI>Ire|land</HI> many Children of twice that Age do nothing but &s;teal, or encumber the
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Hearth and Dunghill. This &s;hameful Neglect of Education &s;hews it&s;elf through the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives, in a matchle&s;s Sloth bred in the very Bone, and not to be accounted for by any outward Hard&s;hip, or Di&s;cou|ragement whatever. It is the native Colour, if we may &s;o &s;peak, and Com|plexion of the People. <HI>Dutch, Engli&s;h, French,</HI> or <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> cannot match them.</P>
<P>Mark an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> at Work in the Field; if a Coach, or Hor&s;eman go by, he is &s;ure to &s;u&s;pend his Labour, and &s;tand &s;taring till they are out of Sight. A Neighbour of mine made it his Re|mark in a Journey from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> that all the Labourers, of whom he enquired the Road, con&s;tantly an&s;wered without looking up, or interrupting their Work, except one who &s;tood &s;taring and leaning on his Spade, and him he found to be an <HI>Iri&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>It is a &s;hameful Thing and peculiar to this Nation, to &s;ee lu&s;ty Vagabonds &s;trolling about the Country, and beg|ging
<PB N="28" REF="27">
without any Pretence to beg. A&s;k them why they do not labour to earn their own Livelihood, they will tell you, They want Employment; offer to em|ploy them, and they &s;hall refu&s;e your Offer; or, if you get them to work one Day, you may be &s;ure not to &s;ee them the next. I have known them decline even the lighte&s;t Labour, that of Hay|making, having at the &s;ame Time nei|ther Clothes for their Backs, nor Food for their Bellies.</P>
<P>A &s;ore Leg is an E&s;tate to &s;uch a Fel|low, and this may be ea&s;ily got, and continued with &s;mall Trouble. Such is their Lazine&s;s, that rather than work they will cheri&s;h a Di&s;temper. This I know to be true, having &s;een more than one In&s;tance, wherein the &s;econd Na|ture &s;o far prevailed over the fir&s;t, that Sloth was preferred to Health. To the&s;e Beggars who make much of their Sores, and prolong their Di&s;ea&s;es, you cannot do a more thankle&s;s Office than cure them, except it be to &s;have their
<PB N="29" REF="28">
Beards, which conciliate a Sort of Re|verence to that Order of Men.</P>
<P>It is indeed a difficult Ta&s;k to re|claim &s;uch Fellows from their &s;lothful and brutal Manner of Life, to which they &s;eem wedded with an Attachment that no temporal Motives can conquer; nor is there, humanly &s;peaking, any Hopes they will mend, except their Re|&s;pect for your Le&s;&s;ons, and Fear of Something beyond the Grave be able to work a Change in them.</P>
<P>Certainly, if I may advi&s;e, you &s;hould in Return for the Lenity and Indulgence of the Government, endeavour to make your&s;elves u&s;eful to the Public; and this will be&s;t be performed, by rou&s;ing your poor Countrymen from their beloved Sloth. I &s;hall not now di&s;pute the Truth or Importance of other Points, but will venture to &s;ay, that you may &s;till find Time to inculcate this Doctrine of an <HI>hone&s;t Indu&s;try,</HI> and that this would by no Means be Time thrown away, if promoting your Country's Intere&s;t, and
<PB N="30" REF="29">
re&s;cuing &s;o many unhappy Wretches of your Communion from Beggary, or the Gallows, be thought worth your Pains.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem you cannot in your Sermons do better than inveigh again&s;t Idlene&s;s, that exten&s;ive Parent of many Mi&s;eries and many Sins; Idlene&s;s the Mother of Hunger and Si&s;ter of Theft; <HI>Idlene&s;s which,</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Sirach</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>teacheth many Vices.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Doctrine is often preached from the Gallows. And indeed the Po|verty, Nakedne&s;s, and Famine which Idlene&s;s entaileth on her Votaries, do make Men &s;o wretched, that they may well think it better to dye than to live &s;uch Lives. Hence a Courage for all villainous Undertakings, which bringing Men to a &s;hameful Death, do then open their Eyes when they are going to be clo&s;ed for ever.</P>
<P>If you have any Regard (as it is not to be doubted) either for the Souls, or
<PB N="31" REF="30">
Bodies of your People, or even for your own Intere&s;t and Credit, you cannot fail to inveigh again&s;t this crying Sin of your Country. Seeing you are obnoxi|ous to the Laws, &s;hould you not in Pru|dence try to reconcile your&s;elves to the Favour of the Public; and can you do this more effectually, than by co-ope|rating with the public Spirit of the Le|gi&s;lature, and Men in Power?</P>
<P>Were this but done heartily, would you but <HI>be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on, reprove, rebuke, exhort</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 2.</NOTE>, &s;uch is the A&s;cendent you have gained over the People, that we might &s;oon expect to &s;ee the good Effects thereof. We might hope <HI>that our Garners would be &s;oon full, affording all Manner of Store, that our Sheep would bring forth thou&s;ands, that our Oxen would be &s;trong to labour, that there would be no breaking in, nor going out,</HI> (no Robbery, nor Migration for Bread) <HI>and that there would be no Com|plaining in our Streets</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cxliv. ver. 13, 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
It &s;tands you upon to act with Vigour in this Cau&s;e, and &s;hake off the Shackles of Sloth from your Countrymen, the rather, becau&s;e there be &s;ome who &s;ur|mi&s;e, that your&s;elves have put them on. Right, or wrong, Men will be apt to judge of your Doctrines by their Fruits. It will reflect &s;mall Honour on their Teachers, if in&s;tead of Hone&s;ty and In|du&s;try tho&s;e of your Communion are peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the contrary Qualities, or if the Nation converted by the great and glorious <HI>Saint Patrick</HI> &s;hould, above all other Nations, be &s;tig|mati&s;ed and marked out as good for no|thing.</P>
<P>I can never &s;uppo&s;e you &s;o much your own Enemies, as to be Friends to this odious Sloth. But were this once abo|li&s;hed, and a laudable Indu&s;try intro|duced in its Stead, it may perhaps be a&s;ked, who are to be Gainers? I an|&s;wer, <HI>your Reverences</HI> are like to be great Gainers; for every Penny you now gain, you would gain a Shilling: you would
<PB N="33" REF="32">
gain al&s;o in your Credit: and your Lives would be more comfortable.</P>
<P>You need not be told, how hard it is to rake from Rags and Penury a tolera|ble Sub&s;i&s;tence; or how offen&s;ive to per|form the Duties of your Function, a|mid&s;t Stench and Na&s;tine&s;s; or how much Things would change for the bet|ter, in Proportion to the Indu&s;try and Wealth of your Flocks. Duty as well as Intere&s;t calls upon you to clothe the Naked, and feed the Hungry, by per|&s;uading them to <HI>eat</HI> (in the Apo&s;tle's Phra&s;e) <HI>their own Bread,</HI> or, as the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>the Labour of their own Hands.</HI> By in&s;piring your Flocks with a Love of Indu&s;try, you will at once &s;trike at the Root of many Vices, and di&s;po&s;e them to practi&s;e many Virtues. This therefore is the readie&s;t Way to improve them.</P>
<P>Con&s;ult your Superiors. They &s;hall tell you the Doctrine here delivered is a &s;ound Catholic Doctrine, not limited to <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> but extending to all, and
<PB N="34" REF="33">
admitted by all, whether <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholics, Chri&s;tians</HI> or <HI>Mahome|tans, Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And as it is of the greate&s;t Extent, &s;o it is al&s;o of the highe&s;t Importance. <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> ex|pre&s;ly &s;aith, <HI>That if any provide not for his own, and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e, he hath denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ch. v. ver. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In vain then do you endeavour to make Men Orthodox in Points of Faith, if at the &s;ame Time in the Eyes of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> you &s;uffer them to be wor&s;e than Infidels, than tho&s;e who have no Faith at all. There is &s;ome|thing it &s;eems wor&s;e than even Infidelity; and to incite and &s;timulate you to put away that cur&s;ed Thing from among you, is the De&s;ign and Aim of this <HI>Ad|dre&s;s.</HI> The Doctrine we recommend is an evident Branch of the Law of Na|ture; it was taught by Prophets, incul|cated by Apo&s;tles, encouraged and en|forced by Philo&s;ophers, Legi&s;lators, and
<PB N="35" REF="34">
all wi&s;e States, in all Ages, and in all Parts of the World. Let me therefore intreat you to exert your&s;elves, <HI>to be in|&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on, rebuke, reprove, exhort.</HI> Take all Opportunities to drive the Lion out of the Way; rai&s;e your Voices, omit no Occa&s;ion, public or private, of awakening your wretched Countrymen from their &s;weet Dream of Sloth.</P>
<P>Many &s;u&s;pect your Religion to be the Cau&s;e of that notorious Idlene&s;s, which prevails &s;o generally among the Natives of this I&s;land, as if the <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Faith was incon&s;i&s;tent with an hone&s;t Diligence in a Man's Calling. But who|ever con&s;iders the great Spirit of Indu&s;|try that reigns in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and even beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> mu&s;t acknow|ledge this to be a groundle&s;s Su&s;picion. In <HI>Piedmont</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> in the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Venetian State,</HI> and indeed throughout all <HI>Lombardy,</HI> how well is the Soil cultivated, and what Manufac|tures of Silk, Velvet, Paper, and other Commodities flouri&s;h? The King of
<PB N="36" REF="35">
<HI>Sardinia</HI> will &s;uffer no idle Hands in his Territories, no Beggar to live by the Sweat of another's Brow; it has even been made penal at <HI>Turin,</HI> to relieve a &s;trolling Beggar. To which I might add, that the Per&s;on who&s;e Authority will be of greate&s;t Weight with you, even the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf, is at this Day en|deavouring to put new Life into the Trade and Manufactures of his Country.</P>
<P>Though I am in no Secret of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet I will venture to affirm, that neither <HI>Pope,</HI> nor <HI>Cardinals,</HI> will be plea&s;ed to hear, that tho&s;e of their Communion are di&s;tingui&s;hed above all others, by Sloth, Dirt, and Beggary; or be di&s;plea&s;ed at your endeavouring to re&s;cue them from the Reproach of &s;uch an infamous Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is as clear as the Sun; what we urge is enforced by every Motive that can work on a rea&s;onable Mind. The Good of your Country, your own private Intere&s;t, the Duty of your Func|tion, the Cries and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Poor
<PB N="37" REF="36">
do with one Voice call for your A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. And if it is on all Hands allowed to be right and ju&s;t, if agreeable both to Rea&s;on and Religion, if coincident with the Views both of your temporal and &s;piritual Superiors, it is to be hoped, <HI>this Addre&s;s</HI> may find a favourable Re|ception, and that a Zeal for di&s;puted Points, will not hinder your concurring to propagate &s;o plain and u&s;eful a Doc|trine, wherein we are all agreed.</P>
<P>When a Leak is to be &s;topped, or a Fire extingui&s;hed, do not all Hands co|operate without Di&s;tinction of Sect or Party? Or if I am fallen into a Ditch, &s;hall I not &s;uffer a Man to help me out, till I have fir&s;t examined his Creed? Or when I am &s;ick, &s;hall I refu&s;e the Phy|&s;ic, becau&s;e my Phy&s;ician doth, or doth not believe the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Supremacy?</P>
<P><HI>Fas e&s;t et ab Ho&s;te doceri.</HI> But in Truth, I am no Enemy to your Per|&s;ons, whatever I may think of your Tenets. On the contrary, I am your &s;incere Well-wi&s;her. I con&s;ider you as
<PB N="38" REF="37">
my Countrymen, as Fellow-Subjects, as profe&s;&s;ing Belief in the &s;ame <HI>Christ.</HI> And I do mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h, there was no other Conte&s;t between us but <HI>Who &s;hall mo&s;t compleatly practi&s;e the Precepts of Him by who&s;e Name we are called, and who&s;e Di&s;ciples we all profe&s;s to be.</HI></P>
