<L>IN former Times, when fierce religious Rage,</L>

<L>All manly Wit, all u&s;eful Learning lay</L>
<L>In Darkne&s;s lo&s;t, nor hop'd returning Day.</L>
<L>Religion then was &s;tain'd by cruel Deeds:</L>
<L>And free-born Rea&s;on &s;toop'd to Craft and Creeds.</L>
<L>But happier We!&mdash;And tho' to-night we &s;how</L>
<L>What fatal Ills from blind Devotion flow,</L>
<L>'Tis not that we &s;uch Rage renew'd can fear,</L>
<L>Or dread the Hand of Per&s;ecution here&mdash;</L>
<L>Our Scene would wide Humanity impart;</L>
<L>Would breathe exten&s;ive Candour thro' the Heart;</L>
<L>Show true Religion even to Error kind,</L>
<L>And claim the perfect Freedom of the Mind.</L>

<L>If too the Poet paints a noble Strife</L>
<L>'Twixt the fond Hu&s;band and the generous Wife;</L>
<L>If all the Father in <HI>his</HI> Voice complains,</L>
<L>And all the Mother in <HI>her</HI> tender Strains;</L>
<L>If the&s;e be&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions prompt the plea&s;ing Woe,</L>

<L>The cur&s;ed Wretch who did a&s;&s;ail thy Life,</L>
<L>O King of <HI>England,</HI> was indeed an Envoy</L>
<L>Sent by the Prince of <HI>Jaffa:</HI> This we own.</L>
<L>But then he was an execrable Bigot,</L>
<L>Who, for &s;uch horrid Purpo&s;es, had crept</L>
<L>Into the cheated Sultan's Court and Service;</L>
<L>As by the Traltor's Papers we have learn'd.</L>
<L>For know, there lives, upon the craggy Cliffs</L>
<L>Of wild <HI>Phenician</HI> Mountains, a dire Race,</L>
<L>A Nation of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Dreadful Zeal,</L>
<L>Fierce and intollerant of all Religion</L>
<L>That differs from their own, is the black Soul</L>
<L>Of that infernal State. Soon as their Chief,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="64">
The Old Man (&s;o they &s;tile him) of the Mountains,</L>

<L>However wicked and abhorr'd it be,</L>

<L>They, &s;wift and &s;ilent, glide thro' every Land,</L>
<L>As fly the gloomy Mini&s;ters of Vengeance,</L>

<L>Make light of Oaths, nay, &s;ometimes change Religion,</L>
