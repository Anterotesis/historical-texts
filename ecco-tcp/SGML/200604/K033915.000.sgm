<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot in the Beginning of this Pre|face be&s;peak the Reader's good Opinion, by infor|ming him that I was put upon the following Work by the Command of &s;ome great Man, who has Pow'r and Intere&s;t. My Friends can bear me witne&s;s that I wanted no &s;uch Incitement: That as &s;oon as ever I heard of the Victory I re&s;olv'd upon writing the Ver&s;es; And though my Intere&s;t at that time, as all who know me know very well, extreamly requir'd that I &s;hould do &s;omething el&s;e, yet it was enough for me that I look'd upon my &s;elf to be oblig'd to do this, by the Duty which I owe to the Publick; which I have al|ways preferr'd before my Intere&s;t. Thus I quickly came to a Re&s;olution of writing the following Ver&s;es, but as to the Form and the Manner of them I re|main'd &s;omething doubtful, till I was determined by her Maje&s;ty's Proclamation for a general Thanks|giving. And that joyn'd to the Con&s;ideration of re|ducing &s;ome former critical Speculations into Pra|ctice, made me re&s;olve as far I was able to make the following Ver&s;es turn upon Religion. My De&s;ign,
<PB REF="4">
when I began them, was to publi&s;h them upon the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> but be&s;ides that ill Health interve|ning caus'd Delay, I &s;oon found to my Sorrow that a Poem is not &s;o ea&s;ily compos'd as a Prayer.</P>
<P>If the following Poem has any Degree of Force or Elevation in it, the judicious Reader will ea&s;ily di&s;|cern that it owes them in a great mea&s;ure to the Reli|gion which is mingled with it; for Religion, as I have formerly prov'd, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid Foun|dation of a great and lofty Spirit in Poetry.</P>
<P>If any one objects that the Religion is double in the following Poem, he will find upon a more &s;trict Enquiry that he is mi&s;taken. For tho' I have made the <HI>Danube</HI> a Per&s;on, that is not making him a Hea|then God. <HI>David</HI> has done the &s;ame thing by <HI>Jor|dan,</HI> and <HI>Deborah</HI> by <HI>Ki&s;hon.</HI></P>
<P>I re&s;olv'd to make the Religion that is mingled with the following Ver&s;es, as Poetical as I could with|out making it Pagan. Though <HI>Fame</HI> is call'd a God|de&s;s there; I by no means de&s;ign the Godde&s;s of the Ancient Poets; but an Angel or Cele&s;tial Spirit: For which I have the Authority of <HI>Milton,</HI> who in the &s;eventh Book of his Poem, by <HI>Urania</HI> does not mean the Heathen Mu&s;e, tho' he calls her Godde&s;s, but an Angel or Cele&s;tial Spirit. And he there makes a &s;econd Invocation which is addre&s;t to her, after he has invok'd God him&s;elf in the Beginning of his Poem. 'Tis true indeed Angels have been always painted Ma&s;culine, but without either any &s;ufficient Rea&s;on or divine Authority. If they have Bodies I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why they mayn't be of both Sexes. If they have none, I cannot imagine how they can be of
<PB REF="5">
either. But a Poet who mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity give them Bodies before they can be proper Machines for him; &s;ince he gives them the Beauty of Women may very well give them the Sex too.</P>
<P>The following Ver&s;es were written without Rime, which I have a long time believed to be below the Ma|je&s;ty of the greater Poetry; for which I have the Au|thority of three eminent Poets, Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> The Reader may &s;ee Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Sentiments in the Preface to his Paradi&s;e lo&s;t, and Mr. <HI>Drydens,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI>'s before the Beginning and at the End of the E&s;&s;ay on tran&s;lated Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>But only the Humble or the Weak will yield to meet Human Authority. They who are conceited of their own Under&s;tandings will &s;ubmit to Rea&s;on alone; And yet methinks the former Authorities carry Rea|&s;on along with them: For they who be&s;t under&s;tand a Controver&s;y, if they have Sincerity, are fitte&s;t to decide it. Now the Sincerity of the three foremen|tioned Writers in relation to Rime ought never to be call'd in que&s;tion; for Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> and my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> are known to have exploded it, at the very time that they wrote in it; and Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> was very well known to be one who would not deceive either him&s;elf or his Reader. It therefore follows that tho&s;e three Gentlemen had le&s;s Under&s;tanding of the Efficacy of Poetry, and the Power of Numbers, than our vulgar Readers who are fond of Rime, or that Rime was very ju&s;tly condemned by them.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now with as much Brevity as we can, give &s;ome Rea&s;ons that are independant of Authority, why
<PB REF="6">
Rime mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity deba&s;e the Maje&s;ty and weaken the Spirit of the greater Poetry, which, bceau&s;e the Arguments are entirely new, may not perhaps be di&s;|agreeable to tho&s;e who have a ta&s;t of Poetry.</P>
<P>The Sentiments in Poetry ereate the Spirit, or the Pa&s;&s;ion, which are but two Words for the &s;ame thing; and the Spirit or Pa&s;&s;ion produces the Expre&s;&s;ion, and begets the Harmony. Now 'tis the Expre&s;&s;ion which &s;hews the Spirit, and 'tis the Harmony which cau&s;es it to make its utmo&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion. And when all the&s;e things are adju&s;ted, when the Sentiments are adapted to the Subject, the Spirit or Pa&s;&s;ion in a ju&s;t Degree to the Sentiments, and the Harmony and the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion to the particular Kind and Degree of Spirit or Pa&s;&s;ion, why then the Re&s;ult of all this is what the Men of Art call Perfection or the Truth of Na|ture. I know indeed very well, that Expre&s;&s;ion and Harmony go together, becau&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion includes the Harmony; yet for the better clearing of the Mat|ter we &s;hall di&s;tinctly treat of them.</P>
<P>This then is certain, that ev'ry Sentiment or Thought has a Degree of Spirit, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Fire, call it what you plea&s;e, which is proper to it, and every thing above or below that Degree is utterly wrong. Now this is as certain that there is but ju&s;t one Expre&s;&s;ion which can convey that Spirit or Pa&s;&s;ion in its true Proportion. And every thing that is not that one Expre&s;&s;ion is fal&s;e, and weakens the Spirit, and ob&s;cures the Sentiment. Now Nature who&s;e Sa|gacity is mo&s;t admirable, and her Operations of Cele|rity almo&s;t infinite, and who goes the &s;horte&s;t way to her Works, very often dictates that Expre&s;&s;ion at
<PB REF="7">
fir&s;t, e&s;pecially in the greater Poetry, where the Ima|gination is always warm, and the Thoughts are al|ways flowing.</P>
<P>But this is plain from common Experience, that the Expre&s;&s;ion, which Nature dictates at fir&s;t, and whieh is powerful, &s;ounding, &s;ignificant, and in &s;hort the true one, is very often alter'd upon the Ac|count of the Rhime. And a Word or two are chang'd, which de&s;troys its Beauty, and the greater part of its Force; makes it le&s;s &s;trong, le&s;s &s;ounding, le&s;s &s;igni|ficant, and weakens the Spirit, and &s;ets the Senti|ment in a fal&s;e Light: From whence it follows that Rime in the greater Poetry running counter to Nature mu&s;t be again&s;t Art.</P>
<P>But as every Sentiment has but one particular Ex|pre&s;&s;ion which of Right belongs to it, &s;o that Expre&s;|&s;ion has but one particular Harmony which is adapted to that peculiar Degree of Spirit which naturally at|tends on the Sentiment. Now Nature, who, as we ob&s;erved before, is wonderful in her Operations, very often in the greater Poetry dictates that Harmony together with the Expre&s;&s;ion. Every Poet mu&s;t know by Experience that the Harmony which we naturally &s;lide into in the greater Poetry is that of Blank Ver&s;e, which whenever we are oblig'd to alter to in|troduce the Rime, we for the mo&s;t part impair the Harmony, infeeble the Expre&s;&s;ion, deba&s;e the Spirit, and &s;et the Sentiment in a wrong View.</P>
<P>There can be no nearer Relation between any two things in the World, than there is, in writing, be|tween Pa&s;&s;ion and Harmony. Harmony may be &s;aid to be both the Father and the Child of Pa&s;&s;ion: 'tis
<PB REF="8">
produced by it, and begets it; and the more pathetick any Di&s;cour&s;e is, the more harmoni|ous it mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be. Even of Di&s;cour&s;es in Pro&s;e, tho&s;e are the mo&s;t mu&s;ical which are the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate. The Orations of <HI>Cicero</HI> have more harmonious Periods than his philo&s;ophical Di&s;|cour&s;es. And therefore Poetry is more harmonious than Pro&s;e becau&s;e it is more pathetick. And the more pathetick Poetry is, the greater mu&s;t be its Har|mony. And therefore the Spirit, the Pa&s;&s;ion, the Fire, or the Flame, being very great in the greater Poetry, and &s;ometimes very violent, have as it were a natural Tendency to the producing perfect Har|mony.</P>
<P>But Rime being utterly fal&s;e in Harmony, as we &s;hall &s;hew immediately, mu&s;t be contrary to true Pa&s;|&s;ion, and to the greater Poetry. Rime is the &s;ame thing in Relation to Harmony that a Pun is in Re|lation to Wit; as a Pun is fal&s;e Wit, or a fooli&s;h Affectation of Wit, Rime is fal&s;e Harmony, or an Affectation of Harmony. Rime may not &s;o ab&s;urdly be &s;aid to be the Pun of Harmony.</P>
<P>There are in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry four things which have been thought to cndouce to Harmony; which are Number, Mea&s;ure, Cadence, and Rime. Of the&s;e the three fir&s;t con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal different Sounds which are dependant one of another.</P>
<P>Rime is wholly independant of the other three; and con&s;i&s;ts in the greater Poetry but of two Sounds, which are Uni&s;ons. Now I appeal to all the Ma&s;ters of Mu&s;ick if Uni&s;ons can make any Harmony. Har|mony is the Agreement of different Sounds, and the
<PB REF="9">
Perfection of Harmony is the Agreement of di&s;cord|ant Sound by the Mediation of others. And there is a great deal of Chromatick Harmony in Poetry as well as in Mu&s;ick. And &s;uch particularly is a great deal of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Harmony. Well then! Rime con&s;i&s;ting of Uni&s;ons can have no Harmony in it &s;elf, and be|ing independant of Numbers, Cadence and Mea&s;ure can never promote the Harmony which they produce. And a Poet's con&s;tant Application to rime, diverts his Application, in a great Degree, from Numbers, Mea&s;ure, and Cadence, and con&s;equently is a &s;evere Re&s;traint upon the three Producers of Harmony. And as it diverts the Application of the Writer, &s;o by al|luring the Attention of vulgar Readers, it diverts them from the other three.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides that, Rime, by the Con&s;traint that it puts upon the Writer, impairs the Beauty and the natural Force of the Expre&s;&s;ion, and the Power of true Harmony; it has &s;omething effeminate in its jingling Nature, and ema&s;culates our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e, and con&s;equently is utterly un&s;it for the greater Poetry. <HI>Engli&s;h Tragedies</HI> that have been writ in Rime mo&s;t of them rowl upon Love. The Soul of a Tragick Poet, who has giv'n him&s;elf up to Rime, has &s;eldom been capable of Terror or Maje&s;ty, or the In|&s;truction of the noble&s;t Philo&s;ophy, or any thing that is truly great.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Rime has in its Nature &s;omething that is low and comical, and the more of Rime there is in a Ver&s;e, the nearer it comes to the Comick. Double Rimes are more comical than the Single, and Treble Ones than Either. A Rime alone is very often a Je&s;t,
<PB REF="10">
as all who are acquainted with <HI>Hudibras</HI> very well know; but never any one was extravagant enough to affirm that there was any thing great and noble in Rime alone.</P>
<P>But the la&s;t Con&s;ideration but one, <HI>viz.</HI> The Effemi|nacy of Rime, and the Influence which it had upon Tragedy, brings me to enquire further into the Mat|ter of Fact; and to add the Proof of Experience to tho&s;e which we have drawn from Authority and Rea|&s;on. For Men of Sen&s;e are too proud to yield to Au|thority, and Fools are too weak to &s;ubmit to Rea&s;on, but Experience, which never deceived any one, carries Conviction both for the one and the other.</P>
<P>The Matter of Fact then is, that mo&s;t of our Plays that have been writ in Rime, have been mo&s;t abominably out of Nature. And where in Rime we have one tolerable Tragedy, in Blank Ver&s;e we have ten. So that tho&s;e very numerical Per&s;ons who de|clare for Rime in other kinds of Poetry, are utterly again&s;t it in Tragedy. But not only the Tragedies in Blank Ver&s;e are the be&s;t, but the very be&s;t of our Epick Poems is writ in the &s;ame Ver&s;e. And that is the Paradi&s;e lo&s;t of <HI>Milton.</HI> And though this may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure be attributed to the admirable and ex|traordinary Choice of the Subject, yet I am &s;atisfied that &s;omething of its Excellence is owing to the Blank Ver&s;e. For Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has handled the very &s;ame Subject in Rime, but has faln &s;o infinitely &s;hort of the Sublimity, the Maje&s;ty, the Vehemence, and the other great Qualities of <HI>Milton,</HI> that they are never to be nam'd together.</P>
<P><PB REF="11">
Well! But &s;ince it is manife&s;t from what has been &s;aid, that Rime is prejudicial both to Poetry and to true Harmony. The Reader may very naturally enquire how it came at fir&s;t to be introduced into our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e? Why, <HI>Milton</HI> has given a very good Account of that; It was, &s;ays he, the Invention of a barbarous Age, to &s;et of wretched Matter and lame Meeter. When Rime was fir&s;t introduced into this I&s;land, the Language was without Harmony, and the Writers were without Genius. And Rime after all that has been &s;aid again&s;t it, mu&s;t be allowed to be an admirable Invention to conceal the want of Spi|rit, and the want of Harmony. Ver&s;e with Rime &s;eems to me to be like the Mu&s;ick of a Bagpipe, where the Drone, by continually &s;tunning your Ears, hinders you from nicely enquiring into the Notes. And what a dexterous Expedient Rime is to conceal the want of Genius, may appear abundantly from mo&s;t of the Riming Plays that were writ and acted in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Time. In mo&s;t of which it is very plain that Rime made extravagant Simile pa&s;s for Nature, abominable Fu&s;tan for fine Language, ri|diculous Rant for great Spirit, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Whining for true Pa&s;&s;ion. Well! But is our Language now without Harmony? So far from that that it is the mo&s;t mu&s;ical perhaps of the <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> Are now our Writers without Genius! No certainly; not all of them. But why does Rime continue then? Why is it writ? Why does it plea&s;e! Why, in the fir&s;t place, there are Thou&s;ands who read Rime, who never &s;o much as heard of Blank Ver&s;e; and when we con&s;i|der tho&s;e who have heard of it, we have little Rea&s;on
<PB REF="12">
to wonder that a great many of them can by no means ta&s;t it, if we reflect upon the Prevalence of Prejudice, and the Force of Cu&s;tom. They who read Poetry, have been us'd to Rime from their Infancy; and what cannot long Habititude render agreeable? Let us in&s;tance particularly in Sounds. Enquire of the Inhabitants of <HI>London</HI> Bridge, if the Fall of the Water there is not grown as it were natural to them by long u&s;e? Ask them if it be not nece&s;&s;ary either to compo&s;e their Spirits, or to keep them up? If they do not &s;leep with the more Soundne&s;s for it, and wake with the more Chearfulne&s;s? Examine a Fellow who has liv'd all his Life in a Paper-mill, and he &s;hall a&s;&s;ure you, that not only the Running round of the Wheels, and the hurrying Noi&s;e of the Mill, but even the in&s;upportable Jangling of the Cogs, is a thing that &s;ooths him, is a thing that plea&s;es him; that he is melancholly when he is long out of the Hearing of it; and even weary and &s;ick of le&s;s tumultuons Sounds. Nay ask even a Fellow that has been bred to &s;awing of Marble, and he &s;hall tell you that the Sound which it makes is Mu&s;ick to him. And &s;aw|ing of Marble, is next to Riming, the mo&s;t imperti|nent Noi&s;e in Nature.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, no Man will wonder if Readers, who have all their Life Time been u&s;ed to Rime, &s;oon grow weary and &s;ick of true Harmony un|le&s;s in Ca&s;e of a delicate Ear, which is &s;o rare a Gift of Nature, that it has been ob&s;erved in every Nation that Harmony has been the very la&s;t thing that has been improved in Poetry, and as &s;oon as in any Na|tion the Poetical Harmony has grown perfect, there the whole Art of Poetry has been accompli&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
But to come from the Readers of Poetry to the Writers: The&s;e la&s;t are of two Sorts; the good and the bad. The bad will certainly endeavour to main|tain Rime, becau&s;e Rime does in &s;ome mea&s;ure con|ceal their want of Ear, and their want of Genius, and is perhaps as nece&s;&s;ary to the giving them a &s;ort of a dull Mettle, and to the keeping them jogging on with their Burden of Dulne&s;s, as Bells are requi&s;ite to a Cart-hor&s;e or to a Pack-hor&s;e; which very Bells upon the Cour&s;e at <HI>New-Market,</HI> would but render the Racer ridiculous, and would but &s;top his Speed. Rime has the la&s;t of the&s;e Effects upon a good Writer, and would have the fir&s;t, if it were not for the Force of Cu&s;tom. And 'tis the Prevalence of Cu|&s;tom alone, that keeps good Writers fa&s;t to it. Some great Men who have writ well in &s;pight of it, &s;erve to keep them in Countenance: for they little con&s;ider that tho&s;e great Men would have writ much better, if they had writ without it. Be&s;ides the Bu&s;ine&s;s of mo&s;t even good Writers is to make them&s;elves popular, there are but few, very few of them who are capable of &s;acrificing their Intere&s;t ro their Reputations, and to the Service which they do to the Publick by improving a noble Art; and they are rather vain than ambiti|ous, and had rather have a pre&s;ent general Applau&s;e, than a Reputation in time to come la&s;ting and univer|&s;al.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al u&s;e of Blank Ver&s;e in Tragedy, and be &s;preading Fame of <HI>Milton</HI> is a &s;ure Progno&s;tick of he decaying Reputation of Rime. A Man may ven|ure to foretell without incurring the Cen&s;ure of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> or vi&s;ionary; that before this Century is half expir'd
<PB REF="14">
Rime will be wholly bani&s;hed from our greater Poetry. A Cu&s;tom that has been a long time generally received, cannot be broke at once; but nothing that is fal&s;e can remain always. 'Tis true indeed, Pre|judice, and Opinion, and Intere&s;t, and Vanity are frequent Friends to Fal&s;hood; but Time, the mo&s;t &s;agacious of all Criticks, will &s;urely be a Friend to Truth.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire that the Reader would take notice that it is only in the greater Poetry that I have been condemning Rime. It may do well enough in Amorous Ver&s;es, and it may be nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome &s;orts of Satyr. For the following Ver&s;es, I do not pretend that becau&s;e they are without Rime they are without all Defects; If I had had more time they &s;hould have been le&s;s numerous, and &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould not have been repeated. Not but that there are &s;everal Repetitions in the follow|ing Poem which were &s;tudied and &s;ought for upon the acc ount ofGrace and Ornament, but there is here and there one which &s;hould have been omitted.</P>
