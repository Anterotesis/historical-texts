E&s;&s;ays. By the Author of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> and
<HI>Argus.</HI> 2 vols. 6s. &s;ewed.</P>
<P><Q>The&s;e E&s;&s;ays are intitled to much commend|ation;
&mdash;they pre&s;ent us with excellent le&s;&s;ons
in virtue and morality, joined to the mo&s;t
lively and ingenious remarks. We have not
room for further extracts, and mu&s;t therefore
conclude our account of this entertaining pub|lication
with ob&s;erving, that, as the &s;ubjects
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in it are, for the mo&s;t part &s;uch as
may well be &s;aid 'to come home to mens' bu|&s;ine&s;s

the book may be peru&s;ed with plea&s;ure and
profit by all.&mdash;<BIBL>Monthly Review.</BIBL></Q></P>

Cron&s;tadt. By Clara Reeve, Author of the Old
Engli&s;h Baron; Two Mentors; and the Progre&s;s of
Romance. 3 vols. 9s. &s;ewed.</P>
<P><Q>An intere&s;ting well conducted &s;tory. The fatal
effects of indulging the tender pa&s;&s;ions, at the
expence of rea&s;on, and in oppo&s;ition to every
worldly con&s;ideration and advantage, are &s;et
in a particular &s;triking point of view. The
principle incidents appear to be borrowed
from a novel of the ju&s;tly admired M. D' Ar|naud.<BIBL>Monthly Review.</BIBL></Q></P>

prove equally agreeable and in&s;tructive to the
children who are a few years older than
the readers of the former work. The pretty
fronti&s;piece to each volume will, we do not
doubt contribute to the entertainment which
this publication will afford to young readers.

<P>8. Hi&s;tory of Henrietta Mortimer, or the Force
of Filial Affection, a Novel; by a Lady. 2 vols.
5s. &s;ewed.</P>
<P><Q>There is a complication in the arrangement
of the &s;everal incidents in this novel which
fixes the attention; and the manners of the
different per&s;onages intere&s;t the reader. The
&s;tory is conducted with art, and unfolded with
&s;kill. The incidents are numerous and well-conducted;
<PB REF="5">
and the work, on the whole, will
afford amu&s;ement for an idle hour, being much
&s;uperior to many novels of the pre&s;ent annual
crop.&mdash;<BIBL>New Lady's Magazine.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>9. Child of Chance, or the Adventures of Harry
Hazard, a Novel; by J. H. Wynn. 2 vols. 6s.
&s;ewed.</P>
<P><Q>The reader is here pre&s;ented with the adven|tures
of a hero, who is a gambler and fortune
hunter; and who at la&s;t, after experiencing the
vici&s;&s;itude to which people of that &s;tamp are
u&s;ually expo&s;ed, reforms, and becomes a re&s;|pectable
character. The work is not ill-writ|ten,
and di&s;plays a fertile imagination.<BIBL>Monthly Review.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>10. Con&s;tance, a Novel; the fir&s;t literary attempt
of a Young Lady. 4 vols. 12s. &s;ewed.</P>
<P><Q>In this artle&s;s narrative, the incidents are nu|merous
and &s;triking, the &s;ituations intere&s;ting
and pathetic, the morality unexceptionable.
The &s;tory is intricate without confu&s;ion, and
the mi&s;takes are explained without violence.
We have felt, in the peru&s;al, the author's
power to harrow up the &s;oul, or, in turn, to
expand it by the warme&s;t, the mo&s;t benevolent
and &s;ocial feelings: in many of the&s;e re&s;pects
our "Young Lady" does not yield to female
novelli&s;ts of the highe&s;t rank. It is, however,
from incidents and &s;ituations that our greate&s;t
intere&s;t and entertainment are derived. In|deed,
we think, the author of Con&s;tance might
make every literary Quidnunc a&s;hamed of his
eagerne&s;s after novelty.<BIBL>Monthly Review.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>11. Emma; or the Unfortunate Attachment. A
new Edition, with beautiful Engravings, 2 vols.
6s. &s;ewed.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
<Q>This plea&s;ing novel, evidently written with a
view to improve as well as to entertain, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es
&s;trong intere&s;t&mdash;the &s;entiments are ju&s;t,
and no where affected&mdash;the incidents are natu|ral,
and many of them deeply affecting; we
are, therefore, induced to recommend the worthy
Emma to the notice of her fair coun|try

<P>Sub&s;cribers are entitled to much greater Advantages
than will be found in any other public Library
in England, and particularly tho&s;e who re&s;ide in

per Year have every new Pamphlet, as well as
new Book as &s;oon as publi&s;hed; the Number of
Books allowed, are twelve in Town, and twenty
in the Country; and will have every Book in
quarto, octavo, and duodecimo, bought for them,
that may not be in the Catalogue:&mdash;To tho&s;e at
One Guinea, the Number is &s;ix in town and ten in
the Country:&mdash;To tho&s;e at Sixteen Shillings per
Year, or Five Shillings per Quarter, two Books
at a Time, and to depo&s;it the Value.</P>
<P>WHEREAS Sub&s;cribers to Circulating Libraries
frequently complain of not having the Books
they want; to obviate this, the Proprietor enga|ges
to purcha&s;e a &s;ufficient quantity of Books,
and to con&s;ult the Convenience and Plea&s;ure of
the Sub&s;cribers in every Re&s;pect: but as a quick
Circulation is one great means to accompli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o de&s;irable an Object, the Proprietor finds it ne|ce&s;&s;ary

<P>This work, which appears every month, contains,
a faithful extract of whatever is valuable in the

&s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to &s;imi|lar

chief, proud, oppre&s;&s;ive, re|vengeful;
and &s;till re&s;iding in all the
pomp of feudal greatne&s;s, within a few
miles of the ca&s;tle of Athlin. Encroach|ment
on the domain of Athlin, was
the occa&s;ion of the animo&s;ity which
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the chiefs. Frequent
broils had happened between their
clans, in which that of Athlin had
generally been victorious. Malcolm,
who&s;e pride was touched by the defeat
of his people; who&s;e ambition was
curbed by the authority, and who&s;e
greatne&s;s was rivalled by the power of
the Earl, conceived for him, that deadly
hatred which oppo&s;ition to its favourite
pa&s;&s;ions naturally excites in a mind
like his, haughty and unaccu&s;tomed to
controul; and he meditated his de&s;truc|tion.
He planned his purpo&s;e with
all that addre&s;s which &s;o eminently
marked his character, and in a battle
<PB N="3" REF="17">
which was attended by the chiefs of
each party in per&s;on, he contrived by
a curious fine&s;&s;e, to entrap the Earl,
accompanied by a &s;mall detachment, in
his wiles, and there &s;lew him. A gene|ral
route of his clan en&s;ued, which
was followed by a dreadful &s;laughter;
and a few only e&s;caped to tell the horrid
cata&s;trophe to Matilda. Matilda, over|whelmed
by the news, and deprived of
tho&s;e numbers which would make re|venge
&s;ucce&s;sful, forbore to &s;acrifice
the lives of her few remaining people
to a feeble attempt at retaliation, and
&s;he was con&s;trained to endure in &s;ilence
her &s;orrows and her injuries.</P>
<P>Incon&s;olable for his death, Matilda
had withdrawn from the public eye,
into this ancient &s;eat of feudal govern|ment,
and there, in the bo&s;om of her
people and her family, had devoted
her&s;elf to the education of her chil|dren.
One &s;on and one daughter were
<PB N="4" REF="18">
all that &s;urvived to her care, and their
growing virtues promi&s;ed to repay all
her tenderne&s;s. O&s;bert was in his nine|teenth
year: nature had given him a
mind ardent and &s;u&s;ceptible, to which
education had added refinement and
expan&s;ion. The vi&s;ions of genius were
bright in his imagination, and his heart,
unchilled by the touch of di&s;appoint|ment,
glowed with all the warmth of
benevolence.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t we enter on the theatre of
the world, and begin to notice the ob|jects
that &s;urround us, young imagina|tion
heightens every &s;cene, and the
warm heart expands to all around it.
The happy benevolence of our feelings
prompts us to believe that every body
is good, and excites our wonder why
every body is not happy. We are fired
with indig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ation at the recital of an act
of inju&s;tice, and at the unfeeling vices
of which we are told. At a tale of
<PB N="5" REF="19">
di&s;tre&s;s our tears flow a full tribute
to pity. At a deed of virtue our heart
unfolds, our &s;oul a&s;pires, we ble&s;s the
action, and feel our&s;elves the doer.
As we advance in life, imagination is
compelled to relinqui&s;h a part of her
&s;weet delirium; we are led reluctantly
to truth through the paths of expe|rience;
and the objects of our fond
attention are viewed with a &s;everer eye.
Here an altered &s;cene appears;&mdash;frowns
where late were &s;miles; deep &s;hades
where &s;ate was &s;un&s;hine: mean pa&s;&s;ions,
or di&s;gu&s;ting apathy &s;tain the features of
the principal figures. We turn indig|nant
from a pro&s;pect &s;o mi&s;erable, and
court again the &s;weet illu&s;ions of our
early days, but ah! they are fled for
ever! Con&s;trained, therefore, to behold
objects in their more genuine forms,
their deformity is by degrees le&s;s pain|ful
to us. The fine touch of moral
&s;u&s;ceptibility, by frequent irritation,
becomes callous, and too frequently
<PB N="6" REF="20">
we mingle with the world, till we are
added to the number of its votaries.</P>
<P>Mary, who was ju&s;t &s;eventeen, had
the accompli&s;hments of riper years,
with the touching &s;implicity of youth.
The graces of her per&s;on were inferior
only to tho&s;e of her mind, which illu|mined
her countenance with inimitable
expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Twelve years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince
the death of the Earl, and time had
blunted the keen edge of &s;orrow. Ma|tilda's
grief had declined into a gentle,
and not unplea&s;ing melancholy, which
gave a &s;oft and intere&s;ting &s;hade to the
natural dignity of her character. Hi|therto
her attention had been &s;olely
directed towards rearing tho&s;e virtues
which nature had planted with &s;o libe|ral
a hand in her children, and which
under the genial influence of her eye,
had flouri&s;hed and expanded into beauty
<PB N="7" REF="21">
and &s;trength. A new hope, and new
&s;olicitudes, now aro&s;e in her brea&s;t:
the&s;e dear children were arrived at an
age, dangerous from its tender &s;u&s;cep|tibility,
and from the influence which
imagination has at that time over the
pa&s;&s;ions. Impre&s;&s;ions would &s;oon be
formed which would &s;tamp their de&s;tiny
for life. The anxious mother lived
but in her children, and &s;he had yet
another cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>When O&s;bert learned the &s;tory of his
father's death, his young heart glowed
to avenge the deed. The late Earl,
who had governed with the real dignity
of power, was adored by his clan; they
were eager to revenge his injuries;
but oppre&s;&s;ed by the generous com|pa&s;&s;ion
of the Counter&s;, their murmurs
&s;unk into &s;ilence: yet they fondly che|ri&s;hed
the hope that their young Lord
would one day lead them on to conque&s;t
and revenge. The time was now come
<PB N="8" REF="22">
when they looked to &s;ee this hope, the
&s;olace of many a cruel moment, realized.
The tender fears of a mother would not
&s;uffer Matilda to ri&s;que the chief of her
la&s;t remaining comforts. She forbade
O&s;bert to engage. He &s;ubmitted in
silence, and endeavoured by application
to his favourite &s;tudies, to &s;tifle the
emotions which rou&s;ed him to arms.
He excelled in the various accompli&s;h|ments
of his rank, but chiefly in the
martial exerci&s;es, for they were conge|nial
to the nobility of his &s;oul, and he
had a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in believing, that
they would one time a&s;&s;i&s;t him to do
ju&s;tice to the memory of his dead father.
His warm imagination directed him to
poetry, and he followed where &s;he led.
He loved to wander among the roman|tic
&s;cenes of the Highlands, where the
wild variety of nature in&s;pired him with
all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of his favourite art.
He delighted in the terrible and in the
grand, more than in the &s;ofter land&s;cape;
<PB N="9" REF="23">
and wrapt in the bright vi&s;ions of
fancy, would often lo&s;e him&s;elf in
awful &s;olitudes.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e rambles, that
having &s;trayed for &s;ome miles over hills
covered with heath, from whence the
eye was pre&s;ented with only the bold
outlines of uncultivated nature, rocks
piled on rocks, cataracts and va&s;t moors
unmarked by the foot of traveller, he
lo&s;t the path which he had him&s;elf
made; he looked in vain for the ob|jects
which had directed him, and his
heart, for the fir&s;t time, felt the repul&s;e
of fear. No ve&s;tige of a human being
was to be &s;een, and the dreadful &s;ilence
of the place was interrupted only by the
roar of di&s;tant torrents, and by the
&s;creams of the birds which flew over his
head. He &s;houted, and his voice was
an&s;wered only by deep echos from the
mountains. He remained for &s;ome time
in a &s;ilent dread not wholly unplea&s;ing,
<PB N="10" REF="24">
but which was &s;oon heightened to a
degree of terror not to be endured; and
he turned his &s;teps backward, forlorn,
and almo&s;t without hope. His memory
gave him back no image of the pa&s;t;
and having wandered &s;ome time, he
came to a narrow pa&s;s, which he entered,
overcome with fatigue and fruitle&s;s
&s;earch: he had not advanced far, when
an abrupt opening in the rock &s;uddenly
pre&s;ented him with a view of the mo&s;t
beautifully romantic &s;pot he had ever
&s;een. It was a valley almo&s;t &s;urrounded
by a barrier of wild rocks, who&s;e ba&s;e
was &s;haded with thick woods of pine
and fir. A torrent which tumbled from
the heights, and was &s;een through the
woods, ru&s;hed with amazing impetu|o&s;ity
into a fine lake which flowed
through the vale, and was lo&s;t in the
deep rece&s;&s;es of the mountains. Herds
of cattle grazed in the bottom, and
the delighted eyes of O&s;bert were once
more ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of human
<PB N="11" REF="25">
dwellings. Far on the margin of the
&s;tream were &s;cattered a few neat cot|tages.
His heart was &s;o gladdened at
the pro&s;pect, that he forgot he had yet
the way to find which led to this Ely|&s;ian
vale. He was ju&s;t awakened to this
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing reality, when his attention
was once more engaged by the manly
figure of a young Highland pea&s;ant,
who advanced towards him with an air
of benevolence, and, having learned his
di&s;tre&s;s, offered to contact him to his
cottage. O&s;bert accepted the invita|tion,
and they wound down the hill,
through an ob&s;cure and intricate path,
together. They arrived at one of the
cottages which the Earl had ob&s;erved
from the height; they entered, and the
pea&s;ant pre&s;ented his gue&s;t to a venera|ble
old Highlander, his father. Refre&s;h|ments
were &s;pread on the table by
a pretty young girl, and O&s;bert after
having partook of them and re&s;ted
awhile, departed, accompanied by Al|leyn,
<PB N="12" REF="26">
the young pea&s;ant, who had offered
to be his guide. The length of the
walk was beguiled by conver&s;ation.
O&s;bert was intere&s;ted by di&s;covering in
his companion a dignity of thought, and
a cour&s;e of &s;entiment &s;imilar to his
own. On their way, they pa&s;&s;ed at
&s;ome di&s;tance the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne.
This object gave to O&s;bert a bitter
reflection, and drew from him a deep
&s;igh. Alleyn made ob&s;ervations on the
bad policy of oppre&s;&s;ion in a chief,
and produced as an in&s;tance the Baron
Malcolm. The&s;e lands, &s;aid he, are
his, and they are &s;carcely &s;ufficient
to &s;upport his wretched people, who,
&s;inking under &s;evere exactions, &s;uffer
to lie uncultivated, tracts which would
otherwi&s;e yield riches to their Lord.
His clan, oppre&s;&s;ed by their burdens,
threaten to ri&s;e and do ju&s;tice to them|&s;elves
by force of arms. The Baron,
in haughty confidence, laughs at their
defiance, and is in&s;en&s;ible to his dan|ger;
<PB N="13" REF="27">
for &s;hould an in&s;urrection hap|pen,
there are other clans who would
eagerly join in his de&s;truction, and
puni&s;h with the &s;ame weapon the tyrant
and the murderer. Surpri&s;ed at the
bold independence of the&s;e words, de|livered
with uncommon energy, the
heart of O&s;bert beat quick, and "O
God! my father!" bur&s;t from his lips.
Alleyn &s;tood agha&s;t! uncertain of the
effect which his &s;peech had produced;
in an in&s;tant the whole truth fla&s;hed into
his mind: He beheld the &s;on of the
Lord whom he had been taught to love,
and who&s;e &s;ad &s;tory had been impre&s;&s;ed
upon his heart in the early days of child|hood;
he &s;unk at his feet, and em|braced
his knees with a romantic ardor.
The young Earl rai&s;ed him from the
ground, and the following words relieved
him from his a&s;toni&s;hment, and
filled his eyes with tears of mingled joy
and &s;orrow. "There are other clans
as ready as your own to avenge the
<PB N="14" REF="28">
wrongs of the noble Earl of Athlin;
the Fitz-Henrys were ever friends to
virtue." The countenance of the youth,
while he &s;poke, was over&s;pread with
the glow of con&s;cious dignity, and his
eyes were animated with the pride of
virtue. The brea&s;t of O&s;bert kindled
with the noble purpo&s;e, but the image
of his weeping mother cro&s;&s;ed his mind,
and checked the ardor of the impul&s;e.
"A time may come, my friend," &s;aid
he, "when your generous zeal will be
accepted with the warmth of gratitude
it de&s;erves. Particular circum&s;tances
will not &s;uffer me, at pre&s;ent, to &s;ay
more." The warm attachment of Al|leyn
to his father &s;unk deep in his
heart.</P>
<P>It was evening ere they reached the
ca&s;tle, and Alleyn remained the Earl's
gue&s;t for that night.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="15" REF="29">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE following day was appointed
for the celebration of an annual
fe&s;tival given by the Earl to his people,
and he would not &s;uffer Alleyn to de|part.
The hall was &s;pread with tables;
and dance and merriment re&s;ounded
through the ca&s;tle. It was u&s;ual on
that day for the clan to a&s;&s;emble in
arms, on account of an attempt, the
memory of which it was meant to per|petuate,
made, two centuries before, by
an ho&s;tile clan to &s;urprize them in their
fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>In the morning were performed the
martial exerci&s;es, in which emulation
was excited by the honorary rewards
be&s;towed on excellence. The Counte&s;s
and her lovely daughter, beheld from
the ramparts of the ca&s;tle, the feats
performed on the plains below. Their
<PB N="16" REF="30">
attention was engaged, and their cu|rio&s;ity
excited by the appearance of a
&s;tranger, who managed the lance and
the bow with &s;uch exqui&s;ite dexterity,
as to bear off each prize of chivalry. It
was Alleyn. He received the palm of
victory, as was u&s;ual, from the hands
of the Earl; and the mode&s;t dignity
with which he accepted it, charmed
the beholders.</P>
<P>The Earl honoured the fea&s;t with his
pre&s;ence, at the conclu&s;ion of which,
each gue&s;t aro&s;e, and &s;eizing his goblet
with his left hand, and with his right
&s;triking his &s;word, drank to the memory
of their departed Lord. The hall
echoed with the general voice. O&s;bert
felt it &s;trike upon his heart the alarum
of war. The people then joined hands,
and drank to the honour of the &s;on
of their late ma&s;ter. O&s;bert under&s;tood
the &s;ignal, and overcome with
emotion, every con&s;ideration yielded to
<PB N="17" REF="31">
that of avenging his father. He aro&s;e,
and harangued the clan with all the fire
of youth and of indignant virtue. As he
&s;poke, the countenance of his people
fla&s;hed with impatient joy; a deep mur|mur
of applau&s;e ran through the a&s;&s;em|bly;
and when he was &s;ilent, each man,
cro&s;&s;ing his &s;word with that of his
neighbour, &s;wore by that &s;acred pledge
of union, never to quit the cau&s;e in
which they now engaged, till the life
of their enemy had paid the debt of
ju&s;tice and of revenge.</P>
<P>In the evening, the wives and daugh|ters
of the pea&s;antry came to the ca&s;tle,
and joined in the fe&s;tivity. It was u&s;ual
for the Counte&s;s and her ladies to
ob&s;erve from a gallery of the hall, the
various performances of dance and &s;ong;
and it had been a cu&s;tom of old for the
daughter of the ca&s;tle to grace the oc|ca&s;ion
by performing a Scotch dance
with the victor of the morning. This
<PB N="18" REF="32">
victor now was Alleyn, who beheld
the lovely Mary led by the Earl into
the hall, and pre&s;ented to him as his
partner in the dance. She received his
homage with a &s;weet grace. She was
dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a Highland la&s;s,
and her fine auburn tre&s;&s;es, which waved
in her neck, were ornamented only with
a wreath of ro&s;es. She moved in the
dance with the light &s;teps of the Graces.
Profound &s;ilence reigned through the
hall during the performance, and a &s;oft
murmur of applau&s;e aro&s;e on its conclu|&s;ion.
The admiration of the &s;pectators
was divided between Mary and the vic|torious
&s;tranger. She retired to the
gallery, and the night concluded in
joy to all but the Earl, and to Alleyn;
but very different was the &s;ource and
the complexion of their inquietude.
The mind of O&s;bert revolved the chief
occurrences of the day, and his &s;oul
burned with impatience to accompli&s;h
the purpo&s;es of filial piety; yet he
<PB N="19" REF="33">
dreaded the effect which the communi|cation
of his de&s;igns might have on the
tender heart of Matilda: on the mor|row,
however, he re&s;olved to acquaint
her with them, and in a few days to
ri&s;e and pro&s;ecute his cau&s;e with arms.</P>
<P>Alleyn, who&s;e bo&s;om till now, had
felt only for others' pains, began to be
con&s;cious of his own. His mind unea&s;y
and re&s;tle&s;s, gave him only the image
of the high-born Mary; he endea|voured
to exclude her idea, but with
an effort &s;o faint, that it would &s;till
intrude! Plea&s;ed, yet &s;ad, he would
not acknowledge even to him&s;elf, that
he loved; &s;o ingenious are we to con|ceal
every appearance of evil from our|&s;elves.
He aro&s;e with the dawn, and
departed from the ca&s;tle full of grati|tude
and &s;ecret love, to prepare his
friends for the approaching war.</P>
<P>The Earl awoke from broken &s;lum|bers,
<PB N="20" REF="34">
and &s;ummoned all his fortitude to
encounter the tender oppo&s;ition of his
mother. He entered her apartment
with faultering &s;teps, and his counte|nance
betrayed the emotions of his &s;oul.
Matilda was &s;oon informed of what
her heart had foreboded, and overcome
with dreadful &s;en&s;ation, &s;unk lifele&s;s
in her chair. O&s;bert flew to her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Mary and the attendants
&s;oon recovered her to &s;en&s;e and wretch|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>The mind of O&s;bert was torn by
the mo&s;t cruel con&s;tict: filial duty, ho|nour,
revenge commanded him to go;
filial love, regret, and pity, entreated
him to &s;tay. Mary fell at his feet, and
cla&s;ping his knees with all the wild
energy of woe, be&s;ought him to relin|qui&s;h
his fatal purpo&s;e, and &s;ave his
la&s;t &s;urviving parent. Her tears, her
&s;ighs, and the &s;oft &s;implicity of her
air, &s;poke a yet &s;tronger language than
<PB N="21" REF="35">
her tongue: but the &s;ilent grief of the
Counte&s;s was &s;till more touching, and
in his endeavours to &s;ooth her, he was
on the point of yielding his re&s;olution,
when the figure of his dying father
aro&s;e to his imagination, and &s;tamped
his purpo&s;e irrevocably. The anxiety of
a fond mother, pre&s;ented Matilda with
the image of her &s;on bleeding and
gha&s;tly; and the death of her Lord was
revived in her memory with all the
agonizing grief that &s;ad event had im|pre&s;&s;ed
upon her heart, the har&s;her
characters of which, the lenient hand
of time had almo&s;t obliterated. So
lovely is Pity in all her attitudes, that
fondne&s;s prompts us to believe &s;he can
never tran&s;gre&s;s; but the changes into a
vice, when &s;he overcomes the purpo&s;es
of &s;tronger virtue. Sterner principles
now nerved the brea&s;t of O&s;bert again&s;t
her influence, and impelled him on to
deeds of arms. He &s;ummoned a few of
the mo&s;t able and tru&s;ty of the clan, and
<PB N="22" REF="36">
held a council of war; in which it
was re&s;olved that Malcolm &s;hould be
attacked with all the force they could
a&s;&s;emble, and with all the &s;peed which
the importance of the preparation would
allow. To prevent &s;u&s;picion and alarm
to the Baron, it was agreed it &s;hould be
given out, that the&s;e preparations were
intended for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a Chief of a
di&s;tant part. That, when they &s;et out
on the expedition, they &s;hould pur&s;ue,
for &s;ome time, a contrary way, but
under favour of the night &s;hould &s;ud|denly
change their route, and turn upon
the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alleyn was &s;tre|nuous
in exciting his friends to the
cau&s;e, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the under|taking,
as to have collected, in a few
days, a number of no incon&s;iderable
con&s;equence. To the warm enthu&s;ia&s;m
of virtue, was now added a new motive
of exertion. It was no longer &s;imply
<PB N="23" REF="37">
an attachment to the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice,
which rou&s;ed him to action; the pride
of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in the eyes
of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and of de&s;erving her
e&s;teem by his zealous &s;ervices, gave
combined force to the fir&s;t impul&s;e
of benevolence. The &s;weet thought of
de&s;erving her thanks, operated &s;ecretly
on his &s;oul, for he was yet ignorant
of its influence there. In this &s;tate he
again appeared at the ca&s;tle, and told the
Earl, that him&s;elf and his friends were
ready to follow him whenever the &s;ignal
&s;hould be given. His offer was accepted
with the warmth of kindne&s;s it claimed,
and he was de&s;ired to hold him&s;elf in
readine&s;s for the on&s;et.</P>
<P>In a few days the preparations were
completed, Alleyn and his friends were
&s;ummoned, the clan a&s;&s;embled in arms,
and with the young Earl at their head,
departed on their expedition. The
parting between O&s;bert and his family
<PB N="24" REF="38">
may be ea&s;ily conceived; nor could
all the pride of expected conque&s;t &s;up|pre&s;s
a &s;igh which e&s;caped from Alleyn
when his eyes bade adieu to Mary,
who, with the Counte&s;s, &s;tood on the
terrace of the ca&s;tle, pur&s;uing with
aching &s;ight the march of her beloved
brother, till di&s;tance veiled him from
her view; &s;he then turned into the ca&s;tle
weeping, and foreboding future cala|mity.
She endeavoured, however, to
to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of tranquil|lity,
that &s;he might deceive the fears of
Matilda, and &s;ooth her &s;orrow. Ma|tilda,
who&s;e mind was &s;trong as her
heart was tender, &s;ince &s;he could not
prevent this hazardous undertaking,
&s;ummoned all her fortitude to re&s;i&s;t
the impre&s;&s;ions of fruitle&s;s grief, and
to &s;earch for the good which the occa|&s;ion
might pre&s;ent. Her efforts were
not vain; &s;he found it in the pro&s;pect
which the enterprize afforded of honour
to the memory of her murdered Lord,
<PB N="25" REF="39">
and of retribution on the head of
the murderer.</P>
<P>It was evening when the Earl de|parted
from the ca&s;tle; he pur&s;ued a
contrary route till night favoured his
de&s;igns, when he wheeled towards the
ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. The extreme
darkne&s;s of the night a&s;&s;i&s;ted their plan,
which was to &s;cale the walls, &s;urprize
the centinels, bur&s;t their way into the
inner courts &s;word in hand, and force
the murderer from his retreat. They
had trod for many miles the dreary
wilds, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lea&s;t gleam
of light, when &s;uddenly their ears were
&s;truck with the di&s;mal note of a watch|bell,
which chimed the hour of the
night. Every heart beat to the &s;ound.
They knew they were near the abode
of the Baron. They halted to con&s;ult
concerning their proceedings, when it
was agreed, that the Earl with Al|leyn
and a chofen few, &s;hould proceed

to reconnoitre the ca&s;tle, while the re&s;t
&s;hould remain at a &s;mall di&s;tance await|ing
the &s;ignal of approach. The Earl
and his party pur&s;ued their march with
&s;ilent &s;teps; they perceived a faint light
which they gue&s;&s;ed to proceed from
the watch-tower of the ca&s;tle, and
they were now almo&s;t under its walls.
They pau&s;ed awhile in &s;ilence to give
breath to expectation, and to listen if
any thing was &s;tirring. All was in|volved
in the gloom of night, and
the &s;ilence of death prevailed. They
had now time to examine, as well as
the darkne&s;s would permit, the &s;itua|tion
of the ca&s;tle, and the height of
the walls; and to prepare for the a&s;&s;ault.
The edifice was built with gothic mag|nificence
upon a high and dangerous
rock. Its lofty towers &s;till frowned in
proud &s;ublimity, and the immen&s;ity of
the pile stood a record of the ancient
con&s;equence of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The rock
was &s;urrounded by a ditch, broad, but
<PB N="27" REF="41">
not deep, over which were two draw|bridges,
one on the north &s;ide, the
other on the ea&s;t; they were both
up, but they &s;eparated in the center,
one half of the bridge remaining on
the &s;ide of the plains. The bridge on
the north led to the grand gateway of
the ca&s;tle; that on the ea&s;t to a &s;mall
watch-tower: the&s;e were all the en|trances.
The rock was almo&s;t per|pendicular
with the walls, which were
&s;trong and lofty. After &s;urveying the
&s;ituation, they pitched upon a &s;pot where
the rock appeared mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible, and
which was contiguous to the principal
gate, and gave &s;ignal to the clan. They
approached in &s;ilence, and gently
throwing down the bundles of fag|got,
which they had brought for the
purpo&s;e, into the ditch, made them|&s;elves
a bridge over which they pa&s;&s;ed
in &s;afety, and prepared to a&s;cend the
heights. It had been re&s;olved that a
party, of which Alleyn was one, &s;hould
<PB N="28" REF="42">
&s;cale the walls, &s;urprize the centinels,
and open the gates to the re&s;t of the
clan, which with the Earl, were to
remain without. Alleyn was the fir&s;t
who fixed his ladder and mounted;
he was in&s;tantly followed by the re&s;t of
his party, and with much difficulty,
and &s;ome hazard, they gained the ram|parts
in &s;afety. They traver&s;ed a part
of the platform without hearing the
&s;ound of a voice or a &s;tep; profound
&s;leep &s;eemed to bury all. A number
of the party approached &s;ome centinels
who were a&s;leep on their po&s;t; them
they &s;eized; while Alleyn, with a few
others, flew to open the neare&s;t gate,
and to let down the drawbridge. This
they accompli&s;hed; but in the mean
time the &s;ignal of &s;urprize was given,
and in&s;tantly the alarm bell rang out,
and the castle re&s;ounded with the clang
of arms. All was tumult and confu|&s;ion.
The Earl with part of his peo|ple
<PB N="29" REF="43">
entered the gate; the re&s;t were fol|lowing,
when &s;uddenly the portcullis
was dropped, the bridge drawn up, and
the Earl and his people found them|&s;elves
&s;urrounded by an armed multi|tude
which poured in torrents from
every rece&s;s of the ca&s;tle. Surprized,
but not daunted, the Earl ru&s;hed for|ward
&s;word in hand, and fought with
a de&s;perate valour. The &s;oul of Alleyn
&s;eemed to acquire new vigour from the
conflict; he fought like a man panting
for honour and certain of victory;
wherever he ru&s;hed, conque&s;t flew before
him. He, with the Earl, forced his
way into the inner courts in &s;earch of
the Baron, and hoped to have &s;atisfied
a ju&s;t revenge, and to have concluded
the conflict with the death of the
murderer; but the moment in which
they entered the courts, the gates were
clo&s;ed upon them; they were environed
by a band of guards; and after a &s;hort
<PB N="30" REF="44">
re&s;i&s;tance, in which Alleyn received a
&s;light wound, they were &s;eized as pri|&s;oners
of war. The &s;laughter without
was great and dreadful: the people of
the Baron in&s;pired with fury, were
in&s;atiate for death; many were killed
in the courts, and on the platform;
many, in attempting to e&s;cape, were
thrown from the ramparts; and many
were de&s;troyed by the &s;udden rai&s;ing of
the bridge. A &s;mall part, only, of
the brave and adventurous band who
had engaged in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, and
who were driven back from the walls,
&s;urvived to carry the dreadful tidings to
the Counte&s;s. The fate of the Earl
remained unknown. The con&s;ternation
among the friends of the &s;lain is not
to be de&s;cribed, and it was heightened
by the unaccountable manner in which
the victory had been obtained; for it was
well known that Malcolm had never,
but when war made it nece&s;&s;ary, more
<PB N="31" REF="45">
&s;oldiers in his garri&s;on than feudal
pomp demanded; yet on this occa&s;ion,
a number of armed men ru&s;hed from
the rece&s;&s;es of his ca&s;tle, &s;ufficient to
overpower the force of a whole clan.
But they knew not the &s;ecret means of
intelligence which the Baron po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed;
the jealou&s;y of con&s;cience had armed
him with apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety;
and for &s;ome years he had planted &s;pies
near the ca&s;tle of Athlin, to ob&s;erve all
that pa&s;&s;ed within it, and to give him
immediate intelligence of every warlike
preparation. A tran&s;action &s;o &s;triking,
and &s;o public as that which had oc|curred
on the day of the fe&s;tival, when
the whole people &s;wore to avenge the
murder of their Chief, it was not pro|bable
would e&s;cape the vigilant eye of
his mercenaries: the incident had been
communicated to him with all the
aggravations of fear and wonder, and
had given him the &s;ignal for defence.
<PB N="32" REF="46">
The accounts &s;ent him of the military
preparations which were forming, con|vinced
him that this defence would
soon be called for; and, laughing at the
idle tales which were told him of di&s;tant
wars, he ha&s;tened to &s;tore his garri&s;on
with arms and with men, and held him|&s;elf
in readine&s;s to receive the a&s;&s;ailants.
The Baron had conducted his plans with
all that power of contrivance which the
&s;ecrecy of the bu&s;ine&s;s demanded; and
it was his de&s;ign to &s;uffer the enemy to
mount his walls, and to put them to
the &s;word, when the purpo&s;e of this
deep-laid &s;tratagem had been nearly
defeated by the drow&s;ine&s;s of the cen|tinels
who were po&s;ted to give &s;ignal of
their approach.</P>
<P>The fortitude of Matilda fainted
under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o heavy a cala|mity;
&s;he was attacked with a violent
illness, which had nearly terminated
<PB N="33" REF="47">
her &s;orrows and her life; and had ren|dered
unavailing all the tender cares of
her daughter. The&s;e tender cares, how|ever,
were not ineffectual; &s;he revived,
and they a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;upport her in the
&s;evere hours of affliction, which the
unknown fate of the Earl occasioned.
Mary, who felt all the horrors of the
late event, was ill qualified for the
po&s;t of a comforter; but her generous
heart, &s;u&s;ceptible of the deep &s;ufferings
of Matilda, almo&s;t forgot its own di&s;|tre&s;s
in the remembrance of her mo|ther's.
Yet the idea of her brother,
&s;urrounded with the horrors of im|pri&s;onment
and death, would often
obtrude it&s;elf on her imagination,
with an empha&s;is which almo&s;t over-came
her rea&s;on. She had al&s;o a &s;trong
degree of pity for the fate of the
brave young Highlander who had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s &s;o no|ble,
in the cau&s;e of her hou&s;e; &s;he
<PB N="34" REF="48">
wi&s;hed to learn his further de&s;tiny,
and her heart often melted in com|pa&s;&s;ion
at the picture which her fancy
drew of his &s;ufferings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>The Earl, after being loaded with
fetters, was conducted to the chief
pri&s;on of the ca&s;tle, and left alone
to the bitter reflections of defeat and
uncertain de&s;tiny; but misfortune,
though it might &s;hake, could not over-come
his firmne&s;s; and hope had not
yet entirely for&s;aken him. It is the
peculiar attribute of great minds, to
bear up with increa&s;ing force again&s;t
the &s;hock of misfortune; with them
the nerves of re&s;i&s;tance &s;trengthen with
attack; and they may be &s;aid to &s;ub|due
adver&s;ity with her own weapons.</P>
<P>Reflection, at length, afforded him
time to examine his pri&s;on: it was a
&s;quare room, which formed the &s;ummit
of a tower built on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the
ca&s;tle, round which the bleak winds
howled mournfully; the in&s;ide of the
<PB N="36" REF="50">
apartment was old and falling to decay:
a &s;mall mattra&s;s, which lay in one cor|ner
of the room, a broken matted chair,
and a tottering table, compo&s;ed its fur|niture;
two &s;mall and &s;trongly grated
windows, which admitted a &s;ufficient
degree of light and air, afforded him
on one &s;ide a view into an inner court,
and on the other a dreary pro&s;pect of
the wild and barren Highlands.</P>
<P>Alleyn was conveyed through dark
and winding pa&s;&s;ages to a di&s;tant part
of the ca&s;tle, where at length a &s;mall
door, barred with iron, opened, and
di&s;clo&s;ed to him an abode, whence light
and hope were equally excluded. He
&s;huddered as he entered, and the door
was clo&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>The mind of the Baron, in the mean
time, was agitated with all the direful
pa&s;&s;ions of hate, revenge, and exulting
pride. He racked imagination for the
<PB N="37" REF="51">
invention of tortures equal to the force
of his feelings; and he at length di&s;co|verod
that the &s;ufferings of &s;u&s;pen&s;e are
&s;uperior to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t terrible
evils, when once a&s;certained, of which
the contemplation gradually affords to
&s;trong minds the means of endurance.
He determined, therefore, that the Earl
&s;hould remain confined in the tower,
ignorant of his future de&s;tiny; and in
the mean while &s;hould be allowed food
only &s;ufficient to keep him &s;en&s;ible of
his wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>O&s;bert was immer&s;ed in thought,
when he heard the door of his pri&s;on
unbarred, and the Baron Malcolm &s;tood
before him. The heart of O&s;bert
&s;welled high with indignation, and de|fiance
fla&s;hed in his eyes. "I am come,"
&s;aid the in&s;ulting victor, "to welcome
the Earl of Athlin to my ca&s;tle; and to
&s;hew that I can receive my friends with
the ho&s;pitality they de&s;erve; but I am
<PB N="38" REF="52">
yet undetermined what kind of fe&s;tival
I &s;hall be&s;tow on his arrival."</P>
<P>"Weak tyrant," returned O&s;bert,
his countenance impre&s;&s;ed with the firm
dignity of virtue, "to in&s;ult the van|qui&s;hed,
is congenial to die cruel mean|ne&s;s
of the murderer; nor do I expect,
that the man who &s;lew the father, will
&s;pare the &s;on; but know, that &s;on is
nerved again&s;t your wrath, and wel|comes
all that your fears or your cruelty
can impo&s;e."</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h youth," replied the Baron,
"your words are air; they fade from
&s;en&s;e, and &s;oon your boa&s;ted &s;trength
&s;hall &s;ink beneath my power. I go to
meditate your de&s;tiny." With the&s;e
words he quitted the pri&s;on, enraged at
the unbending virtue of the Earl.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of the Baron, rou&s;ed in the
&s;oul of O&s;bert, all tho&s;e oppo&s;ite emo|tions
<PB N="39" REF="53">
of furious indignation and tender
pity, which the glowing image of his
&s;ather could excite, and produced a
moment of perfect mi&s;ery. The dread|ful
energy of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations exa&s;pe|rated
his brain almo&s;t to madne&s;s; the
cool fortitude in which he had &s;o lately
gloried, di&s;appeared; and he was on the
point of re&s;igning his virtue and his
life, by means of a &s;hort dagger, which
he wore concealed under his ve&s;t, when
the &s;oft notes of a lute &s;urpri&s;ed his
attention. It was accompanied by a
voice &s;o enchantingly tender and me|lodious,
that its &s;ounds fell on the heart
of O&s;bert, in balmy comfort: it &s;eemed
&s;ent by Heaven to arre&s;t his fate:&mdash;the
&s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion was hu&s;hed within
him, and he di&s;&s;olved in kind tears of
pity and contrition. The mournful
tenderne&s;s of the air, declared the per|son
from whom it came to be a &s;ufferer;
and O&s;bert &s;u&s;pected it to proceed from
a pri&s;oner like him&s;elf. The mu&s;ic
<PB N="40" REF="54">
cea&s;ed. Ab&s;orbed in wonder, he went to
the grates in que&s;t of the &s;weet mu&s;i|cian,
but no one was to be &s;een; and
he was uncertain whether the &s;ounds
aro&s;e from within or from without the
ca&s;tle. Of the guard, who brought
him his &s;mall allowance of food, he
enquired concerning what he had heard;
but from him he could not obtain the
information he &s;ought, and he was con|&s;trained
to remain in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ca&s;tle of Ath|lin,
and its neighbourhood was over|whelmed
with di&s;tre&s;s. The news of the
Earl's impri&s;onment at length reached
the ears of the Counte&s;s, and hope once
more illumined her mind. She imme|diately
&s;ent offers of immen&s;e ran&s;om
to the Baron, for the re&s;toration of her
&s;on, and the other pri&s;oners; but the
ferocity of his nature di&s;dained an in|complete
triumph. Revenge &s;ubdued
<PB N="41" REF="55">
his avarice; and the offers were rejected
with the &s;purn of contempt. An addi|tional
motive, however, operated in his
mind, and confirmed his purpo&s;e. The
beauty of Mary had been often reporte
to him in terms which excited his curi|o&s;ity;
and an accidental view he once
obtained of her, rai&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion in his
&s;oul, which the turbulence of his cha|racter
would not &s;uffer to be extin|gui&s;hed.
Various were the &s;chemes he
had projected to obtain her, none of
which had ever been executed; the
po&s;&s;e&s;ion of the Earl, was a circum|&s;tance
the mo&s;t favourable to his wi&s;hes;
and he re&s;olved to obtain Mary, as the
future ran&s;om of her brother. He con|cealed,
for the pre&s;ent, his purpo&s;e,
that the tortures of anxiety and de&s;pair
might operate on the mind of the Coun|tess,
to grant him an ea&s;y con&s;ent to the
exchange, and to re&s;ign the victim the
wife of her enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="56">
The &s;mall remains of the clan, un|&s;ubdued
by misfortune, were eager to
a&s;&s;emble; and, hazardous as was the
enterprize, to attempt the re&s;cue of
their Chief. The hope which this un|dertaking
afforded, once more revived
the Counte&s;s; but alas! a new &s;ource
of &s;orrow was now opened for her: the
health of Mary vi&s;ibly declined; &s;he
was &s;ilent and pen&s;ive; her tender
frame was but too &s;u&s;ceptible of the
&s;ufferings of her mind; and the&s;e &s;uffer|ings
were heightened by concealment.
She was ordered amu&s;ement and gen|tle
exerci&s;e, as the be&s;t re&s;toratives of
peace and health. One day, as &s;he was
&s;eeking on hor&s;eback the&s;e lo&s;t trea|&s;ures,
&s;he was tempted by the fine|ne&s;s
of the evening to prolong her
ride beyond its u&s;ual limits; the &s;un
was declining when &s;he entered a wood,
who&s;e awful glooms &s;o well accorded
with the pen&s;ive tone of her mind. The
&s;oft &s;erenity of evening, and the &s;till
<PB N="43" REF="57">
&s;olemity of the &s;cene, con&s;pired to lull
her mind into a plea&s;ing forgetfulne&s;s of
its troubles; from which &s;he was, ere
long, awakened, by the approaching
&s;ound of hor&s;es' feet. The thickne&s;s of
the &s;oliage limited her view; but look|ing
onward, &s;he thought &s;he perceived
through the trees, a glittering of arms;
&s;he turned her palfrey, and &s;ought the
entrance of the wood. The clattering
of hoofs advanced in the breeze; her
heart mi&s;gave her, and &s;he quickened
her pace. Her fears were &s;oon ju&s;tified;
&s;he looked back, and beheld three
hor&s;emen, armed and di&s;gui&s;ed, ad|vancing
with the &s;peed of pur&s;uit.
Almo&s;t fainting, &s;he flew on the wings
of terror; all her efforts were vain; the
villains came up; one &s;eized her hor&s;e,
the others fell upon her two attendants:
a &s;tout &s;cuffle en&s;ued, but the &s;trength of
her &s;ervants &s;oon yielded to the weapons
of their adver&s;aries; they were brought to the
ground, dragged into the wood, and
<PB N="44" REF="58">
there left bound to the trees. In the
mean time, Mary, who had fainted in the
arms of the villain who &s;eized her, was
borne away through the intricate mazes
of the woods; and her terrors may be
ea&s;ily imagined, when &s;he revived, and
found her&s;elf in the hands of unknown
men. Her dreadful &s;creams, her tears,
her &s;upplications, were ineffectual; the
wretches were deaf alike to pity and to
enquiry; they pre&s;erved an in&s;lexible
&s;ilence, and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf conveying
towards the mouth of a horrible cavern,
when de&s;pair &s;eized her mind, and &s;he
lo&s;t all &s;igns of exi&s;tence: in this &s;tate
&s;he remained &s;ome time; but it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to de&s;cribe her &s;ituation, when
&s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, and beheld Al|leyn,
who was watching with the mo&s;t
trembling anxiety her return to life,
and who&s;e eyes, on &s;eeing her revive,
&s;wam in joy and tenderne&s;s. Wonder,
fearful joy, and the various &s;hades of
mingled emotions, pa&s;&s;ed in quick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="45" REF="59">
over her countenance; her &s;ur|prize
was increa&s;ed, when &s;he ob&s;erved
her own &s;ervants &s;tanding by, and could
di&s;cover no one but friends. She
&s;carcely dared to tru&s;t her &s;en&s;es, but
the voice of Alleyn, tremulous with
tenderne&s;s, di&s;&s;olved in a moment the
illu&s;ions of fear, and confirmed her in
the &s;urpri&s;ing reality. When &s;he was
&s;ufficiently recovered, they quitted this
&s;cene of gloom; they travelled on in a
&s;low pace, and the &s;hades of night were
fallen long before they reached the
ca&s;tle; there di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion ap|peared.
The Counte&s;s, alarmed with
the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions, had
di&s;patched her &s;ervants various ways in
&s;earch of her child, and her tran&s;ports
on again beholding her in &s;afety, pre|vented
her ob&s;erving immediately that
it was Alleyn who accompanied her.
Joy, however, &s;oon yielded to its equal
wonder, when &s;he perceived him, and
in the tumult of contending emotions,
<PB N="46" REF="60">
&s;he &s;carce knew which fir&s;t to interro|gate.
When &s;he had been told the
e&s;cape of her daughter, and by whom
effected, &s;he prepared to hear with im|patient
&s;olicitude, news of her beloved
&s;on, and the means by which the brave
young Highlander had eluded the vigi|lance
of the Baron. Of the Earl, Al|leyn
could only inform the Counte&s;s,
that he was taken pri&s;oner with him&s;elf,
within the walls of the fortre&s;s, as they
fought &s;ide by &s;ide; that he was con|ducted,
unwounded, to a tower, &s;ituated
on the ea&s;t angle of the ca&s;tle, where he
was &s;till confined. Him&s;elf had been
impri&s;oned in a di&s;tant part of the pile,
and had been able to collect no other
particulars of the Earl's &s;ituation, than
tho&s;e he had related. Of him&s;elf, he
gave a brief relation of the following
circum&s;tances:</P>
<P>After having lain &s;ome weeks in the
horrible dungeon allotted him, his
<PB N="47" REF="61">
mind involved in the gloom of de&s;pair,
and filled with the momentary expecta|tion
of death, de&s;peration furni&s;hed him
with invention, and he concerted the
following plan of e&s;cape:&mdash;He had ob|&s;erved,
that the guard who brought
him his allowance of food, on quitting
the dungeon, con&s;tantly &s;ounded his
&s;pear again&s;t: the pavement near the en|trance.
This circum&s;tance excited his
&s;urprize and curio&s;ity. A ray of hope
beamed through the gloom of his dun|geon.
He examined the &s;pot, as well
as the ob&s;curity of the place would per|mit;
it was paved with flag &s;tones like
the other parts of the cell, and the
paving was every where equally firm.
He, however, became certain, that &s;ome
means of e&s;cape was concealed beneath
that part, for the guard was con&s;tant in
examining it by &s;triking that &s;pot, and
treading more firmly on it; and this he
endeavoured to do without being ob|&s;erved.
One day, immediately after
<PB N="48" REF="62">
the departure of the guard, Alleyn &s;et
him&s;elf to unfa&s;ten the pavement; this,
with much patience and indu&s;try, he
effected, by means of a &s;mall knife which
had e&s;caped the &s;earch of the &s;oldiers.
He found the earth beneath hard, and
without any &s;ymtoms of being lately
di&s;turbed; but after digging a few feet,
he arrived at a trap door; he trembled
with eagerne&s;s. It was now almo&s;t night,
and he was overcome with wearine&s;s;
he doubted whether he &s;hould be able
to penetrate through the door, and
what other ob&s;tructions were behind it,
before the next day. He therefore,
threw the earth again into the hole, and
endeavoured to clo&s;e the pavement;
with much difficulty, he trod the earth
into the opening, but the pavement he
was unable exactly to replace. It was
too dark to examine the &s;tones; and he
found, that even if he &s;hould be able to
make them fit, the pavement could not
be made firm. His mind and body
<PB N="49" REF="63">
were now overcome, and he threw him|&s;elf
on the ground in an agony of de|&s;pair.
It was midnight, when the re|turn
of his &s;trength and &s;pirits produced
another effort. He tore the earth up
with ha&s;ty violence, cut round the lock
of the trap door, and railing it, unwil|ling
to he&s;itate or con&s;ider, &s;prung
through the aperture. The vault was
of con&s;iderable depth, and he was
thrown down by the violence of the
fall: an hollow echo, which &s;eemed to
murmur at a di&s;tance, convinced him
that the place was of con&s;iderable ex|tent.
He had no light to direct him,
and was therefore, obliged to walk with
his arms extended, in &s;ilent and fearful
examination. After having wandered
through the void a con&s;iderable time, he
came to a wall, along which he groped
with anxious care; it conducted him
onward for a length of way; it turned;
he followed, and his hand touched the
cold iron work of a barred window.
<PB N="50" REF="64">
He felt the gentle undulation of the air
upon his face; and to him who had been
&s;o long confined among the damp va|pours
of a dungeon, this was a moment
of luxury. The air gave him &s;trength;
and the means of e&s;cape, which now
&s;eemed pre&s;ented to him, renewed his
courage. He &s;et his foot again&s;t the
wall, and gra&s;ping a bar with his hand,
found it gradually yield to his &s;trength,
and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive efforts, he entirely di&s;|placed
it. He attempted another, but
it was more firmly fixed, and every
effort to loo&s;en it was ineffectual; he
found that it was fa&s;tened in a large
&s;tone of the wall, and that to remove
this &s;tone, was his only means of di&s;|placing
the bar; he &s;et him&s;elf, there|fore,
again to work with his knife, and
with much patience, loo&s;ened the mor|tar
&s;ufficiently to effect his purpo&s;e.
After &s;ome hours, for the darkne&s;s made
his labour tedious, and &s;ometimes inef|fectual,
he had removed &s;everal of the
<PB N="51" REF="65">
bars, and had made an opening almo&s;t
&s;ufficient to permit his e&s;cape, when the
dawn of light appeared; he now di&s;|covered,
with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, that
the grate opened into an inner court of
the ca&s;tle, and even while he he&s;itated,
he could perceive &s;oldiers de&s;cending
&s;lowly into the court, from the narrow
&s;tairca&s;es which led to their apartments.
His heart &s;ickened at the &s;ight. He
re&s;ted again&s;t the wall in a pau&s;e of
de&s;pair, and was on the point of &s;pring|ing
into the court, to make a de&s;perate
effort at e&s;cape, or die in the attempt,
when he perceived by the increa&s;ing
light which fell acro&s;s the vault, a ma&s;&s;y
door in the oppo&s;ite wall; he ran to|wards
it, and endeavoured to open it; it
was fa&s;tened by a lock and &s;everal bolts.
He &s;truck again&s;t it with his foot, and
the hollow &s;ound which was returned,
convinced him that there were vaults
beyond; and by the direction of the&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="66">
vaults, he was certain that they mu&s;t
extend to the outer walls of the ca&s;tle;
if he could gain the&s;e vaults, and pene|trate
beyond them in the darkne&s;s of
the en&s;uing night, it would be ea&s;y to
leap the wall, and cro&s;s the ditch; but
it was impo&s;&s;ible to cut away the lock,
before the return of his guard, who re|gularly
vi&s;ited the cell &s;oon after the
dawn of day. After &s;ome con&s;ideration,
therefore, he determined to &s;ecrete him|&s;elf
in a dark part of the vault, and
there await the entrance of the guard,
who on ob&s;erving the deranged bars of
the grate, would conclude, that he had
e&s;caped through the aperture. He had
&s;carcely placed him&s;elf according to his
plan, when he heard the door of the
dungeon unbolted; this was in&s;tantly fol|lowed
by a loud voice, which &s;ounded
down the opening, and "Alleyn" was
&s;houted in a tone of fright and con&s;ter|nation.
After repeating the call, a man
jumped into the vault. Alleyn, though
<PB N="53" REF="67">
him&s;elf concealed in darkne&s;s, could
perceive, by the faint light which fell
upon the &s;pot, a &s;oldier with a drawn
&s;word in his hand. He approached the
grate with execrations, examined it,
and proceeded to the door; it was fa&s;t;
he returned to the grate, and then pro|ceeded
along the walls, tracing them
with the point of his &s;word. He at
length approached the &s;pot where Al|leyn
was concealed, who felt the &s;word
&s;trike upon his arm, and in&s;tantly gra&s;p|ing
the hand which held it, the weapon
fell to the ground. A &s;hort &s;cuffle en|&s;ued;
Alleyn threw down his adver&s;ary,
and &s;tanding over him, &s;eized the &s;word,
and pre&s;ented it to his brea&s;t; the &s;oldier
called for mercy. Alleyn, always unwil|ling
to take the life of another, and con|&s;idering
that if the &s;oldier was &s;lain, his
comrades would certainly follow to the
vault, returned him his &s;word. "Take
your life," &s;aid he, "your death can
avail me nothing;&mdash;take it, and if you
<PB N="54" REF="68">
can, go tell Malcolm, that an innocent
man has endeavoured to e&s;cape de&s;truc|tion."
The guard, &s;truck with his con|duct,
aro&s;e from the ground in &s;ilence,
he received his &s;word, and followed Al|leyn
to the trap door. They returned
into the dungeon, where Alleyn was
once more left alone. The &s;oldier, un|determined
how to act, went to find his
comrades; on the way he met Malcolm,
who, ever re&s;tle&s;s and vigilant, fre|quently
walked the ramparts at an early
hour. He enquired if all was well.
The &s;oldier, fearful of di&s;covery, and
unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;&s;emble, he&s;itated at
the que&s;tion; and the &s;tern air a&s;&s;umed
by Malcolm, compelled him to relate
what had happened. The Baron, with
much har&s;hne&s;s, reprobated his neglect,
and immediately followed him to the
dungeon, where he loaded Alleyn with
in&s;ult. He examined the cell, de&s;cended
into the vault, and returning to the
dungeon, &s;tood by, while a chain, which
<PB N="55" REF="69">
had been fetched from a di&s;tant part of
the ca&s;tle, was fixed into the wall;&mdash;to
this Alleyn was fa&s;tened. "We will
not long confine you thus," &s;aid Mal|colm,
as he quitted the cell, "a &s;ew
days &s;hall re&s;tore you to the liberty you
are &s;o fond of; but as a conqueror
ought to have &s;pectators of his triumph,
you mu&s;t wait till a number is collected
&s;ufficient to witne&s;s the death of &s;o great
an hero." "I di&s;dain your in&s;ults,"
returned Alleyn, "and am equally able
to &s;upport misfortune, and to de&s;pi&s;e a
tyrant." Malcolm retired, enraged at
the boldne&s;s of his pri&s;oner, and utter|ing
menaces on the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the
guard, who vainly endeavoured to ju&s;|tify
him&s;elf. "His &s;afety be upon
your head," &s;aid the Baron. The &s;oldier
was &s;hocked, and turned away in &s;ullen
&s;ilence. Dread of his pri&s;oners eftect|ing
an e&s;cape, now &s;eized his mind;
the words of Malcolm filled him with
re&s;entment, while gratitude towards
<PB N="56" REF="70">
Alleyn, for the life he had &s;pared, ope|rated
with the&s;e &s;entiments, and he he|&s;itated
whether he &s;hould obey the Ba|ron,
or deliver Alleyn, and fly his op|pre&s;&s;or.
At noon, he carried him his
cu&s;tomary food; Alleyn was not &s;o lo&s;t
in mi&s;ery, but that he ob&s;erved the
gloom which hung upon his features;
his heart foreboded impending evil:
the &s;oldier bore on his tongue the &s;en|tence
of death. He told Alleyn, that
the Baron had appointed the following
day for his execution; and his people
were ordered to attend. Death, how|ever
long contemplated, mu&s;t he dread|ful
when it arrives; this was no more
than what Alleyn had expected, and on
what he had brought his mind to gaze
without terror; but his fortitude now
&s;unk before its immediate pre&s;ence, and
every nerve of his frame thrilled with
agony. "Be comforted," &s;aid the &s;ol|dier,
in a tone of pity, "I, too, am no
&s;tranger to mi&s;ery; and if you are wil|ling
<PB N="57" REF="71">
to ri&s;que the danger of double
torture, I will attempt to relea&s;e both
you and my&s;elf from the hands of a
tyrant." At the&s;e words, Alleyn &s;tarted
from the ground in a tran&s;port of de|lightful
wonder: "Tell me not of
torture," cried he, "all tortures are
equal if death is the end, and from
death 1 may now e&s;cape; lead me but
beyond the&s;e walls, and the &s;mall po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
I have, &s;hall be your's for ever."
"I want them not," replied the gene|rous
&s;oldier, "it is enough for me, that
I &s;ave a fellow-creature from de&s;truc|tion."
The&s;e words overpowered the
heart of Alleyn, and tears of gratitude
&s;welled in his eyes. Edric told him, that
the door he had &s;een in the vault below,
opened into a chain of vaults, which
&s;tretched beyond the wall of the ca&s;tle,
and communicated with a &s;ubterraneous
way, anciently formed as a retreat from
the fortre&s;s, and which terminated in
the cavern of a fore&s;t at &s;ome di&s;tance.
<PB N="58" REF="72">
If this door could be opened, their
e&s;cape was almo&s;t certain. They con|&s;ulted
on the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to be
taken. The &s;oldier gave Alleyn a
knife larger than the one he had, and
directed him to cut round the lock,
which was all that with-held their pa&s;|&s;age.
Edric's office of centinel, was
propitious to their &s;cheme, and it was
agreed that at midnight they &s;hould
de&s;cend the vaults. Edric, after hav|ing
unfa&s;tened the chain, left the cell,
and Alleyn &s;et him&s;elf again to remove
the pavement, which had been already
re-placed by order of the Baron. The
near pro&s;pect of deliverance now glad|dened
his &s;pirits; his knife was better
formed for his purpo&s;e; and he worked
with alacrity and ea&s;e. He arrived at
the trap door, and once more leaped into
the vault. He applied him&s;elf to the
lock of the door, which was extremely
thick, and it was with difficulty he &s;epa|rated
them; with trembling hands he
<PB N="59" REF="73">
the bolts, the door unclo&s;ed, and di&s;co|vered
to him the vaults. It was even|ing
when he fini&s;hed his work: He
was but ju&s;t returned to the dungeon,
and had thrown him&s;elf on the ground
to re&s;t, when the &s;ound of a di&s;tant &s;tep-caught
his ear; he li&s;tened to its ad|vance
with trembling eagerne&s;s. At
length the door was unbolted; Alleyn
breathle&s;s with expectation, &s;tarted up,
and beheld not his &s;oldier, but another;
the opening was again di&s;covered, and
all was now over. The &s;oldier brought
a pitcher of water, and ca&s;ting round
the place a look, of &s;ullen &s;crutiny, de|parted
in &s;ilence. The &s;tretch of human
endurance was now exceeded, and Al|leyn
&s;unk dawn in a &s;tate of torpidity.
On recovering, he found him&s;elf again
enveloped in the horrors of darkne&s;s,
&s;ilence, and de&s;pair. Yet amid all his
&s;ufferings, he di&s;dained to doubt the in|tegrity
of his &s;oldier: we naturally re|coil
from painful &s;en&s;ations, and it is
<PB N="60" REF="74">
one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures of a
noble mind, to doubt the &s;incerity of
tho&s;e in whom it has confided. Alleyn
concluded, that the conver&s;ation of the
morning had been overheard, and that
this guard had been &s;ent to examine the
cell, and to watch his movements. He
believed that Edric was now, by his
own genero&s;ity, involved in de&s;truction;
and in the energy of this thought, he
forgot for a moment his own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Midnight came, but Edric did not
appear; his doubts were now con|firmed
into certainty, and he re&s;igned
him&s;elf to the horrid tranquillity of
mute de&s;pair. He heard from a di&s;|tance,
the clock of the ca&s;tle &s;trike one;
it &s;eemed to &s;ound the knell of death;
it rou&s;ed his benumbed &s;en&s;es, and he
ro&s;e from the ground in an agony of
acute&s;t recollection. Suddenly he heard
the &s;teps of two per&s;ons advancing
down the avenue; he &s;tarted, and li&s;|tened.
<PB N="61" REF="75">
Malcolm and murder, aro&s;e to
his mind; he doubted not that the
&s;oldier had reported what he had &s;een in
the evening, and that the per&s;ons whom
he now heard, were coming to execute
the final orders of the Baron. They
now drew near the dungeon, when &s;ud|denly
he remembered the door in the
vault. His &s;en&s;es had been &s;o &s;tunned
by the appearance of the &s;tranger, and
his mind &s;o occupied with a feeling of
de&s;pair, as to exclude every idea of
e&s;cape; and in the energy of his &s;uffer|ings
he had forgot this la&s;t re&s;ource; it
now fla&s;hed like lightning upon his
mind; he &s;prung to the trap door, and
his feet had &s;carcely touched the bot|tom
of the vault, when he heard the
bolts of the dungeon undraw; he had
ju&s;t reached the entrance of the inner
vault, when a voice founded from above;
he pau&s;ed, and knew it to be Edric's;
apprehen&s;ion &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his
mind, that he he&s;itated whether he
<PB N="62" REF="76">
&s;hould di&s;cover him&s;elf, but a moment
of recollection di&s;&s;ipated every ignoble
&s;u&s;picion of Edric's fidelity, and he an|&s;wered
the call. Immediately Edric
de&s;cended, followed by the &s;oldier
who&s;e former appearance had filled Al|leyn
with de&s;pair, and whom Edric
now introduced as his faithful friend
and comrade, who like him&s;elf, was
weary of the oppre&s;&s;ion of Malcolm,
and who had re&s;olved to fly with them,
and e&s;cape his rigour. This was a mo|ment
of happine&s;s too great for thought!
Alleyn, in the confu&s;ion of his joy,
and in his impatience to &s;eize the mo|ment
of deliverance, &s;carcely heard the
words of Edric. Edric having returned
to fa&s;ten the door of the dungeon, to
delay pur&s;uit, and given Alleyn a &s;word
which he had brought for him, led the
way through the vaults. The profound
&s;ilence of the place, was interrupted
only by the echoes of their foot&s;teps,
which running through the dreary
<PB N="63" REF="77">
cha&s;ms in confu&s;ed whi&s;perings, filled
their imaginations with terror. In tra|ver&s;ing
the&s;e gloomy and de&s;olate re|ce&s;&s;es,
they often pau&s;ed to li&s;ten, and
often did their fears give them the di&s;|tant
&s;ounds of pur&s;uit. On quitting
the vaults, they entered an avenue,
winding, and of con&s;iderable length,
from whence branched &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages
into the rock; it was clo&s;ed by a low
and narrow door, which opened upon a
flight of &s;teps, that led to the &s;ubterra|neous
way under the ditch of the ca&s;tle.
Edric knew the intricacies of the place:
they entered, and clo&s;ing the door, be|gan
to de&s;cend, when the lamp which
Edric carried in his hand was blown
out by the current of the wind, and
they were left in total darkne&s;s. Their
feelings may be more ea&s;ily imagined
than expre&s;&s;ed; they had, however, no
way but to proceed, and grope with
cautious &s;teps the dark aby&s;s. Having
continued to de&s;cend for &s;ome time,
<PB N="64" REF="78">
their feet reached the bottom, and they
found them&s;elves once more on even
ground; but Edric knew they had yet
another flight to encounter, before they
could gain the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age
under the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, and for which it re|quired
their utmo&s;t caution to &s;earch.
They were proceeding with flow and
wary &s;teps, when the foot of Alleyn
&s;tumbled upon &s;omething which clat|tered
like broken armour, and endea|vouring
to throw it from him, he felt
the weight re&s;i&s;t his effort: he &s;tooped
to di&s;cover what it was, and found in
his gra&s;p the cold hand of a dead per|&s;on.
Every nerve thrilled with horror
at the touch, and he &s;tarted back in an
agony of terror. They remained for
&s;ome time in &s;ilent di&s;may, unable to
return, yet fearful to proceed, when a
faint light which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from
the bottom of the la&s;t: de&s;cent, gleamed
upon the walls, and di&s;covered to them
the &s;econd &s;tairca&s;e, and at their feet
<PB N="65" REF="79">
the pale and disfigured corp&s;e of a man
in armour, while at a di&s;tance they
could di&s;tingui&s;h the figures of men.
At this &s;ight their hearts died within
them, and they gave them&s;elves up for
lo&s;t. They doubted not but the men
whom they &s;aw were the murderers;
that they belonged to the Baron; and
were in &s;earch of &s;ome fugitives from
the ca&s;tle. Their only chance of con|cealment
was to remain where they
were; but the light appeared to ad|vance,
and the faces of the men to turn
towards them. Winged with terror,
they &s;ought the fir&s;t a&s;cent, and flying
up the &s;teps, reached the door, which
they endeavoured to open, that they
might hide them&s;elves from pur&s;uit
among the intricacies of the rock; their
efforts, however, were vain, for the
door was fa&s;tened by a &s;pring lock, and
the key was on the other &s;ide; com|pelled
to give breath to their fears, they
ventured to look back, and found them|&s;elves
<PB N="66" REF="80">
again in total darkne&s;s; they
pau&s;ed upon the &s;teps, and li&s;tening, all
was &s;ilent. They re&s;ted here a con&s;i|derable
time; no foot&s;teps &s;tartled
them; no ray of light darted through
the gloom; everything &s;eemed hu&s;hed
in the &s;ilence of death: they re&s;olved
once more to venture forward; they
gained again the bottom of the fir&s;t de|&s;cent,
and &s;huddering as they ap|proached
the &s;pot where they knew the
corp&s;e was laid, they groped to avoid
its horrid touch, when &s;uddenly the
light again appeared, and in the &s;ame
place wnere they had fir&s;t &s;een it. They
&s;tood petrified with de&s;pair. The light,
however, moved &s;lowly onward, and
di&s;appeared in the windings of the ave|nue.
After remaining a long time in
&s;ilent &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and finding no further
ob&s;tacle, they ventured to proceed. The
light had di&s;covered to them their &s;itu|ation,
and the &s;tairca&s;e, and they now
moved with greater certainty. They
<PB N="67" REF="81">
reached the bottom in &s;afety, and with|out
any fearful interruption; they li&s;|tened,
and again the &s;ilence of the
place was undi&s;turbed. Edric knew
they were now under the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, their
way was plain before them, and their
hopes were renewed in the belief, that
the light and the people they had &s;een,
had taken a different direction, Ed|ric
knowing there were various pa&s;|&s;ages
branching from the main avenue
which led to different openings in the
rock. They now &s;tepped on with ala|crity,
the pro&s;pect of deliverance was
near, for Edric judged they were now not
far from the cavern; an abrupt
turning in the pa&s;&s;age confirmed at
once this &s;uppo&s;ition, and extingui&s;hed
the hope which had attended it; for the
light of a lamp bur&s;t &s;uddenly upon
them, and exhibited to their &s;ickening
eyes, the figures of four men in an atti|tude
of menace, with their &s;words
pointed ready to receive them. Alleyn
<PB N="68" REF="82">
drew his &s;word and advanced, "We will
die hardly," cried he. At the &s;ound
of his voice, the weapons in&s;tantly
dropped from the hands of his adver&s;a|ries,
and they advanced to meet hin in
a tran&s;port of joy. Alleyn recognized
with a&s;toni&s;hment, in the faces of the
three &s;trangers, his faithful friends and
followers; and Edric in that of the
fourth, a fellow &s;oldier. The &s;ame pur|po&s;e
had a&s;&s;embled them all in the
&s;ame &s;pot. They quitted the cave to|gether;
and Alleyn in the joyful expe|rience
of unexpected deliverance, re|&s;olved
never more to admit de&s;pair.
They concluded, that the body which
they had pa&s;&s;ed in the avenue, was that
of &s;ome per&s;on who had peri&s;hed either
by hunger or by the &s;word in tho&s;e &s;ub|terranean
labyrinths.</P>
<P>They marched in company till they
came within a few miles of the ca&s;tle of
Athlin, when Alleyn made known his
<PB N="69" REF="83">
de&s;ign of collecting his friends, and
joining the clan in an attempt to re|lea&s;e
the Earl; Edric, and the other
&s;oldier, having &s;olemnly inli&s;ted in the
cau&s;e, they parted; Alleyn and Edric
pur&s;uing the road to the ca&s;tle, and the
others &s;triking off to a different part of
the country. Alleyn and Edric had not
proceeded far, when the groans of the
wounded &s;ervants of Matilda drew them
to the wood, in which the preceding
dreadful &s;cene had been acted. The
&s;urprize of Alleyn was extreme, when
he di&s;covered the &s;ervants of the Earl
in this &s;ituation; but &s;urprize &s;oon
yielded to a more poignant &s;en&s;ation,
when he heard that Mary had been car|ried
off by armed men. He &s;carcely
waited to relea&s;e the &s;ervants, but &s;eiz|ing
one of their hor&s;es which was graz|ing
near, in&s;tantly mounted, ordering
the re&s;t to follow, and took the way
which had been pointed as the cour&s;e of
the ravi&s;hers. Fortunately it was the
<PB N="70" REF="84">
right direction; and Alleyn and the
&s;oldier came up with them as they were
ha&s;tening to the mouth of that cavern,
who&s;e frightful a&s;pect had chilled the
heart of Mary with a temporary death.
Their endeavours to fly were vain; they
were overtaken at the entrance; a &s;harp
conflict en&s;ued, in which one of the
ruffians was wounded and &s;led; his com|rades
&s;eeing the &s;ervants of the Earl ap|proaching,
relinqui&s;hed their prize, and
e&s;caped through the rece&s;&s;es of the cave.
The eyes of Alleyn were now fixed in
horror on the lifele&s;s form of Mary,
who had remained in&s;en&s;ible during the
whole of the affray; he was exerting
every effort for her recovery, when &s;he
unclo&s;ed her eyes, and joy once move
illumined his &s;oul.</P>
<P>During the recital of the&s;e particu|lars,
which Alleyn delivered with a mo|de&s;t
brevity, the mind of Mary had &s;uf|fered
a variety of emotions &s;ympathetic
<PB N="71" REF="85">
to all the vici&s;&s;itudes of his &s;ituation.
She endeavoured to conceal from her&s;elf
the particular intere&s;t &s;he felt in his ad|ventures,
but &s;o unequal were her ef|forts
to the &s;trength of her emotions,
that when Alleyn related the &s;cene of
Dunbayne cavern, her cheek grew pale,
and &s;he relap&s;ed into a fainting fit.
This circum&s;tance alarmed the penetra|tion
of the Counte&s;s; but the known
weakne&s;s of her daughter's frame ap|peared
a probable cau&s;e of the di&s;order,
and repre&s;&s;ed her fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion. It
gave to Alleyn a mixed delight of hope
and fear, &s;uch as he had never known
before; for the fir&s;t time he dared to
acknowledge to his own heart that he
loved, and that heart for the fir&s;t time
thrilled with the hope of being loved again.</P>
<P>He received from the Counte&s;s, the
warm over-flowings of a heart grateful
for the pre&s;ervation of its child, and
<PB N="72" REF="86">
from Mary a blu&s;h which &s;poke more
than her tongue could utter. But the
minds of all were involved in the ut|mo&s;t
perplexity concerning the rank
and the identity of the author of the
plan, nor could they di&s;cover any clue
which would lead them through this in|tricate
maze of wonder, to the villain
who had fabricated &s;o diabolical a
&s;cheme. Their &s;u&s;picions, at length,
re&s;ted upon the Baron Malcolm, and
this &s;uppo&s;ition was confirmed by the
appearance of the hor&s;emen, who evi|dently
acted only as the agents of &s;upe|rior
power. Their conjectures were
indeed ju&s;t. Malcolm was the author
of the &s;cheme. It had been planned,
and he had given orders to his people to
execute it long before the Earl fell into
his hands. They had, however, found
no opportunity of accompli&s;hing the
de&s;ign when the ca&s;tle was &s;urprized,
and in the con&s;equent tumult of his
<PB N="73" REF="87">
mind, the Baron had forgot to with|draw
his orders.</P>
<P>Alleyn expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign of col|lecting
the &s;mall remnant of his friends,
and uniting with the clan in attempting
the re&s;cue of the Earl. "Noble youth,"
exclaimed the Counte&s;s, unable longer
to repre&s;s her admiration, "how can I
ever repay your generous &s;ervices! Am
I then to receive both my children at
your hands? Go&mdash;my clan are now col|lecting
for a &s;econd attempt upon the
walls of Dunbayne,&mdash;go! lead them to
conque&s;t, and re&s;tore to me my &s;on."
The languid eyes of Mary re-kindled
at the&s;e words, &s;he glowed with the
hope of cla&s;ping once more to her bo|&s;om
her long lo&s;t brother; but the &s;uf|fu&s;ions
of hope were &s;oon chaced by the
chilly touch of fear, for it was Alleyn
who was to lead the enterprize, and it
was Alleyn who might fall in the at|tempt.
The&s;e contrary emotions un|veiled
<PB N="74" REF="88">
to her at once the &s;tate of her
affections, and &s;he &s;aw in the eye of
fancy, the long train of inquietudes and
&s;orrows which were likely to en&s;ue.
She &s;ought to obliterate from her mind
every remembrance of the pa&s;t, and of
the fatal knowledge which was now
di&s;clo&s;ed to her, but &s;he &s;ought in vain,
for the monitor in her brea&s;t con&s;tantly
pre&s;ented to her mind the image of Al|leyn,
adorned with tho&s;e brave and man|ly
virtues which had &s;o eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed
his conduct; the in&s;ignifi|cance
of the pea&s;ant was lo&s;t in the no|bility
of the character, and every effort
at forgetfulne&s;s was baffled.</P>
<P>Alleyn pa&s;&s;ed that night at the ca&s;tle,
and the next morning, after taking leave
of the Counte&s;s and her daughter, to
whom his eyes bade a re&s;pectful and
mournful adieu, he departed with Edric,
for his father's cottage, impatient to
acquaint the good old man with his
<PB N="75" REF="89">
&s;afety, and to rou&s;e to arms his &s;lum|bering
friends. The breath of love
had now rai&s;ed into flame tho&s;e
&s;parks of ambition which had &s;o long
been kindling in his brea&s;t; he was
not only eager to avenge the cau&s;e of
injured virtue, and to re&s;cue from mi|&s;ery
and death, the &s;on of the Chief
whom he had been ever taught to reve|rence,
but he panted to avenge the
in&s;ult offered to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and to
atchieve &s;ome deed of valour worthy
her admiration and her thanks.</P>
<P>Alleyn found his father at break|fa&s;t,
with his niece at his &s;ide; his
face was darkened with &s;orrow, and
he did not perceive Alleyn when he
entered. The joy of the old man
almo&s;t overcame him, when he be|held
his &s;on in &s;afety, for he was the
&s;olace of his declining years; and Edric
was welcomed with the heartine&s;s of
an old friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>MEANWHILE the Earl remained
a &s;olitary pri&s;oner in the tower;
uncertain fate was yet &s;u&s;pended over
him; he had, however, a magnanimity
in his nature which baffled much of the
cruel effort of the Baron. He had pre|pared
his mind by habitual contempla|tion
for the wor&s;t, and although that
wor&s;t was death, he could now look to
it even with &s;erenity. Tho&s;e violent
tran&s;ports which had a&s;&s;ailed him on
&s;ight of the Baron, were, &s;ince he was
no longer &s;ubject to his pre&s;ence, re|duced
within their proper limits; yet
he anxiou&s;ly avoided dwelling on the
memory of his father, left tho&s;e dread|ful
&s;en&s;ations &s;hould threaten him with
returning torture. Whenever he per|mitted
him&s;elf to think of the &s;ufferings
of the Counte&s;s and his &s;i&s;ter, his heart
<PB N="77" REF="91">
melted with a &s;orrow that almo&s;t un|nerved
him; much he wi&s;hed to know
how they &s;upported this trial, and much
he wi&s;hed that he could convey to them
intelligence of his &s;tate. He endea|voured
to ab&s;tract his mind from his
&s;ituation, and &s;ought to make him&s;elf
artificial comforts even from the barren
objects around him; his chief amu&s;e|ment
was in ob&s;erving the manners and
cu&s;toms of the birds of prey which
lodged them&s;elves in the battlements of
his tower, and the rapacity of their na|ture
furni&s;hed him with too ju&s;t a paral|lel
to the habits of men.</P>
<P>As he was one day &s;tanding at the
grate which looked upon the ca&s;tle,
ob&s;erving the progre&s;s of the&s;e birds,
his ear caught the &s;ound of that &s;weet
lute who&s;e notes had once &s;aved him
from destruction; it was accompanied
by the &s;ame melodious voice he had
formerly heard, and which now &s;ung
<PB N="78" REF="92">
with impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s the follow|ing
air:</P>
<LG>
<L>When fir&s;t the vernal morn of life,</L>
<L>Beam'd on ray infant eye,</L>
<L>Fond I &s;urvey'd the &s;miling &s;cene,</L>
<L>Nor &s;aw the tempe&s;t nigh.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>My guilele&s;s heart expanded wide,</L>
<L>With filial fondne&s;s fraught;</L>
<L>Paternal love that heart &s;upplied</L>
<L>With all its fondne&s;s &s;ought.</L>

<L>Pale Grief Hope's trembling rays di&s;pers'd,</L>
<L>And Fancy's dreams di&s;&s;olv'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>Lo&s;t in &s;urprize, O&s;bert &s;tood for
&s;ome time looking down upon an inner
court, whence the &s;ounds &s;eemed to
ari&s;e; after a few minutes he ob&s;erved
<PB N="79" REF="93">
a young lady enter from that &s;ide on
which the tower aro&s;e, on her arm re&s;ted
an elder one, in who&s;e face might be
traced the lines of decaying beauty, but
it was vi&s;ible from the melancholy
which clouded her features, that the
finger of affliction had there anticipated
the ravages of time. She was dre&s;&s;ed
in the habit of a widow, and the black
veil which &s;haded her forehead, and
gave a fine expre&s;&s;ion to her counte|tenance,
devolved upon the ground in a
length of train, and heightened the na|tural
maje&s;ty of her figure; &s;he moved
with &s;low &s;teps, and was &s;upported by
the young lady who&s;e veil half di&s;clo&s;ed
a countenance where beauty was touched
with &s;orrow and inimitable expre&s;&s;ion;
the elegance of her form, and the dig|nity
of her air, proclaimed her to be of
di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. On her arm was
hung that lute, who&s;e melody had ju&s;t
charmed the attention of the Earl, who
was now fixed in wonder at what he
<PB N="80" REF="94">
beheld, that was equalled only by his
admiration. They retired through a
gate on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the court,
and were &s;een no more. O&s;bert fol|lowed
them with his eyes, which for
&s;ome time remained fixed upon the
door through which they had di&s;ap|peared,
almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of their de|parture.
When he returned to him&s;elf,
he di&s;covered, as if for the fir&s;t time,
that he was in &s;olitude. He conjectured
that the&s;e &s;trangers were confined by
the oppre&s;&s;ive power of the Baron, and
his eyes were &s;uffu&s;ed with tears of pity.
When he con&s;idered that &s;o much beau|ty
and dignity were the unre&s;i&s;ting vic|tims
of a tyrant, his heart &s;welled high
with indignation, his pri&s;on became in|tolerable
to him, and he longed to be|come
at once the champion of virtue,
and the deliverer of oppre&s;&s;ed innocence.
The character of Malcolm aro&s;e to his
mind black with accumulated guilt,
and aggravated the dete&s;tation with
<PB N="81" REF="95">
which he had ever contemplated it:
the hateful idea nerved his &s;oul with a
confidence of revenge. Of the guard,
who entered, he enquired concerning
the &s;trangers, but could obtain no po&s;i|tive
an&s;wer; he came to impart other
news; to prepare the Earl for death;
for the morrow was appointed for his
execution. He received the intelli|gence
with the firm hardihood of indig|nant
virtue, di&s;daining to &s;olicit, and
di&s;daining to repine; and his mind yet
gra&s;ped the idea of revenge. He drove
from his thoughts with precipitation,
the tender idea of his mother and &s;i&s;ter;
remembrances which would &s;ubdue his
fortitude, without effecting any benefi|cial
purpo&s;e. He was told of the e&s;cape
of Alleyn; this intelligence gave him
inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, and he knew this
faithful youth would undertake to
avenge his death.</P>
<P>When the news of Alleyn's flight
<PB N="82" REF="96">
had reached the Baron, his &s;oul was
&s;tung with rage, and he called for the
guards of the dungeon; they were no
where to be found; and after a long
&s;earch it was known that they were &s;led
with their pri&s;oner: the flight of the
other captives was al&s;o di&s;covered. This
circum&s;tance exa&s;perated the pa&s;&s;ion of
Malcolm to the utmo&s;t, and he gave
orders that the life of the remaining
centinel &s;hould be forfeited for the
treachery of his comrades, and his own
negligence; when recollecting the Earl,
whom in the heat of his re&s;entment he
had forgot, his heart exulted in the op|portunity
he afforded of complete re|venge;
and in the fullne&s;s of joy with
which he pronounced his &s;entence, he
retracted the condemnation of the trem|bling
guard. The moment after he had
di&s;patched the me&s;&s;enger with his re|&s;olve
to the Earl, his heart faultered
from its purpo&s;e. Such is the alter|nate
violence of evil pa&s;&s;ions, that they
<PB N="83" REF="97">
never &s;uffer their &s;ubjects to act with
con&s;i&s;tency, but torn by conflicting
energies, the gratification of one pro|pen&s;ity
is de&s;truction to the enjoyment
of another; and the moment in which
they imagine happine&s;s in their gra&s;p,
is to them the moment of di&s;appoint|ment.
Thus it was with the Baron;
his &s;oul &s;eemed to attain its full enjoy|ment
in the contemplation of revenge,
till the idea of Mary inflamed his heart
with an oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ion; his wi&s;hes had
caught new ardor from di&s;appoint|ment,
for he had heard that Mary had
been once in the power of his emi&s;&s;aries;
and perhaps the pain which recoils,
upon the mind from every fruitle&s;s effort
of wickedne&s;s, &s;erved to encrea&s;e the
energies of his de&s;ires. He &s;purned
the thought of relinqui&s;hing the pur&s;uit,
yet there appeared to he no method of
obtaining its object but by &s;acrificing
his favourite pa&s;&s;ion; for he had little
doubt of obtaining Mary, when it &s;hould
<PB N="84" REF="98">
be known that he re&s;olved not to grant
the life of the Earl upon any other ran|&s;om.
The balance of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions
hung in his mind in &s;uch nice equili|brium,
that it was for &s;ome time uncer|tain
which would preponderate; re|venge,
at length, yielded to love; but
he re&s;olved to pre&s;erve the torture of
expected death, by keeping the Earl
ignorant of his reprieve till the la&s;t
moment.</P>
<P>The Earl awaited death with the &s;ame
&s;tern fortitude with which he received
its &s;entence, and was led from the tower
to the platform of the ca&s;tle, &s;ilent and
unmoved. He beheld the preparations
for his execution, the in&s;truments of
death, the guards arranged in files, with
an eye undaunted. The glare of exter|nals
had no longer power over his ima|gination.
He beheld every object with
indifference, but that on which his eye
now re&s;ted; it was on the murderer,
<PB N="85" REF="99">
who exhibited him&s;elf in all the pride
of exulting conque&s;t: he &s;tarted at the
&s;ight, and his &s;oul &s;hrunk back upon
it&s;elf. Di&s;daining, however, to appear
di&s;concerted, he endeavoured to re&s;ume
his dignity, when the remembrance of
his mother, overwhelmed with &s;orrow,
ru&s;hed upon his mind, and quite un|manned
him; the tears &s;tarted in his
eyes, and he &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the
ground.</P>
<P>On recovering, he found him&s;elf in
his pri&s;on, and he was informed that the
Baron had granted him a re&s;pite. Mal|colm
mi&s;taking the cau&s;e of di&s;order in
the Earl, thought he had &s;tretched his
&s;ufferings to their utmo&s;t limits; he
therefore had ordered him to be recon|veyed
to the tower.</P>
<P>A &s;cene &s;o &s;triking and &s;o public as
that which had ju&s;t been performed at
the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, was a &s;ubject of
<PB N="86" REF="100">
di&s;cour&s;e to the whole country; it was
&s;oon reported to the Counte&s;s with a va|riety
of additional circum&s;tances, among
which it was affirmed that the Earl had
been really executed. Overwhelmed
with this intelligence, Matilda relap&s;ed
into her former di&s;order. Sickne&s;s had
rendered Mary le&s;s able to &s;upport the
&s;hock, and to apply that comfort to the
afflictions of her mother, which had
once been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully admini&s;tered.
The phy&s;ician pronounced the malady
of the Counte&s;s to be &s;eated in the
mind, and beyond the reach of human
&s;kill, when one day a letter was brought
to her, the &s;uper&s;cription of which
was written in the hand of O&s;bert; &s;he
knew the characters, and bur&s;ting the
&s;eal, read that her &s;on was yet alive,
and did not de&s;pair of throwing him&s;elf
once more at her feet. He reque&s;ted
that the remains of his clan might im|mediately
attempt his relea&s;e. He de|&s;cribed
in what part of the ca&s;tle his
<PB N="87" REF="101">
pri&s;on was &s;ituated, and thought that by
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of long &s;caling ladders and
ropes, contrived in the manner he
directed, he might be able to effect his
e&s;cape through the grate. This letter
was a reviving cordial to the Counte&s;s
and to Mary.</P>
<P>Alleyn was indefatigable in collect|ing
followers for the enterprize he had
engaged in. On receiving intelligence
of the &s;afety of the Earl, he vi&s;ited the
clan, and was &s;trenuous in exhorting
them to immediate action. They re|quired
little incitement to a cau&s;e in
which every heart was &s;o much inte|re&s;ted,
and for which every hand was
already bu&s;ied in preparation. The&s;e
preparations were at length completed;
Alleyn, at the head of his party, joined
the a&s;&s;embled clan. The Counte&s;s for
a &s;econd time beheld from the ramparts
the departure of her people upon the
&s;ame hazardous enterprize; the pre&s;ent
<PB N="88" REF="102">
&s;cene revived in her mind a &s;ad remem|brance
of the pa&s;t; the &s;ame tender
fears, and the &s;ame prayers for &s;ucce&s;s
&s;he now gave to their departure; and
when they faded in di&s;tance from her
fight, &s;he returned into the ca&s;tle di&s;|&s;olved
in tears. The heart of Mary
was torn by a complex &s;orrow, and
incapable of longer concealing from
her&s;elf the intere&s;t &s;he took in the de|parture
of Alleyn, her agitation became
more apparent. The Counte&s;s in vain
endeavoured to compo&s;e her mind.
Mary, affected by her tender concern,
and prompted by the natural ingenu|ou&s;ne&s;s
of her di&s;po&s;ition, longed to
make her the confidant of her weakne&s;s,
if weakne&s;s that can be termed which
ari&s;es from gratitude, and from the ad|miration
of great and generous qualities;
but delicacy and timidity arre&s;ted the
half formed &s;entence, and clo&s;ed her
lips in &s;ilence. Her health gradually
declined under the &s;ecret agitation of
<PB N="89" REF="103">
her mind; her phy&s;ician knew her di&s;|order
to originate in &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;orrow,
and advi&s;ed, as the be&s;t cordial, a confi|dential
friend. Matilda now perceived
the cau&s;e of her grief; her former
pa&s;&s;ing ob&s;ervations recurred to her me|mory,
and ju&s;tified her di&s;cernment.
She &s;trove by every &s;oothing effort to win
her to her confidence. Mary, oppre&s;&s;ed
by the idea of ungenerous concealment,
re&s;olved at length to unveil her heart
to a mother &s;o tender of her happine&s;s.
She told her all her &s;entiments. The
Counte&s;s &s;uffered a di&s;tre&s;s almo&s;t equal
to that of her daughter; her affectionate
heart &s;welled with equal wi&s;hes for her
happine&s;s; &s;he admired with warme&s;t
gratitude the noble and a&s;piring vir|tues
of the young Highlander; but the
proud nobility of her &s;oul repelled with
quick vivacity every idea of union
with a youth of &s;uch ignoble birth: &s;he
regarded the pre&s;ent attachment as the
pa&s;&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion of youthful fancy,
<PB N="90" REF="104">
and believed that gentle rea&s;oning, aided
by time and endeavour, would conquer
the enthu&s;ia&s;m of love. Mary li&s;tened
with attention to the rea&s;onings of the
Counte&s;s; her judgment acknowledged
their ju&s;tne&s;s, while her heart regretted
their force. She re&s;olved, however, to
overcome an attachment which would
produce &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s to her family
and to her&s;elf. Notwith&s;tanding her
endeavours to exclude Alleyn from her
thoughts, the generous and heroic qua|lities
of his mind bur&s;t upon her me|mory
in all their &s;plendor; &s;he could
not but be con&s;cious that he loved her;
&s;he &s;aw the &s;truggles of his &s;oul, and
the delicacy of his pa&s;&s;ion, which made
him ever retire in the mo&s;t profound
and re&s;pectful &s;ilence from its object.
She &s;olicited her mother to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ex|pelling
the de&s;tructive image from her
mind. The Counte&s;s exerted every ef|fort
to amu&s;e her-to forgetfulne&s;s; every
hour except tho&s;e which were given to
<PB N="91" REF="105">
exerci&s;es nece&s;&s;ary for her health, was
devoted to the cultivation of her mind,
and the improvement of her various
accompli&s;hments. The&s;e endeavours
were not un&s;ucce&s;sful; the Counte&s;s
with joy ob&s;erved the returning health
and tranquillity of her daughter; and
Mary almo&s;t believed &s;he had taught
her&s;elf to forget. The&s;e engagements
&s;erved al&s;o to beguile the tedious mo|ments
which mu&s;t intervene, ere news
could arrive from Alleyn concerning
the probable &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize.</P>
<P>Mi&s;ery yet dwelt in the ca&s;tle of
Dunbayne; for there the virtues were
captive, while the vices reigned de&s;po|tic.
The mind of the Baron, ardent
and re&s;tle&s;s, knew no peace: torn by
conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, he was him&s;elf the
victim of their power.</P>
<P>The Earl knew that his life hung up|on
the caprice of a tyrant; his mind
<PB N="92" REF="106">
was nerved for the wor&s;t; yet the letter
which the compa&s;&s;ion of one of his
guards, at the ri&s;que of his life, had un|dertaken
to convey to the Counte&s;s,
afforded him a faint hope that his peo|ple
might yet effect his e&s;cape. In this
expectation, he &s;pent hour after hour
at his grate, wi&s;hing with trembling
anxiety to behold his clan advancing
over the di&s;tant hills. The&s;e hills be|came
at length, in a &s;ituation &s;o barren
of real comforts, a &s;ource of ideal plea|&s;ure
to him. He was always at the grate,
and often in the fine evenings of &s;ummer,
&s;aw the ladies, who&s;e appearance had &s;o
&s;trongly excited his admiration and pi|ty,
walk on a terrace below the tower.
One very fine evening, under the plea&s;|ing
impre&s;&s;ions of hope for him&s;elf, and
compa&s;&s;ion for them, his &s;ufferings for
a time lo&s;t their acutene&s;s. He longed
to awaken their &s;ympathy, and make
known to them that they had a fellow-pri&s;oner.
The parting &s;un trembled
<PB N="93" REF="107">
on the tops of the mountains, and a
&s;ofter &s;hade fell upon the di&s;tant land|&s;cape.
The &s;weet tranquillity of even|ing
threw an air of tender melancholy
over his mind; his &s;orrows for a while
were hu&s;hed; and under the enthu&s;ia&s;m
of the hour, he compo&s;ed the following
&s;onnet, which, having committed it to
paper, he the next evening dropped up|on
the terrace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>ONE morning early, the Earl di&s;|cerned
a martial band emerging
from the verge of the horizon; his
heart welcomed his hopes, which were
&s;oon confirmed into certainty. It was
his faithful people, led on by Alleyn.
It was their de&s;ign to &s;urround and attack
the ca&s;tle; and though their numbers
gave them but little hopes of conque&s;t,
they yet believed that in the tumult
of the engagement they might pro|cure
the deliverance of the Earl. With
this view they advanced to the walls.
The centinels had de&s;cried them at di&s;|tance;
the alarm was given; the trum|pets
&s;ounded, and the walls of the ca&s;tle
were filled with men. The Baron was
pre&s;ent, and directed the preparations.
The &s;ecret purpo&s;e of his &s;oul was fixed.
The clan &s;urrounded the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, into
<PB N="96" REF="110">
which they threw bundles of faggots,
and gave the &s;ignal of attack. Scaling
ladders were thrown up to the window
of the tower. The Earl, invigorated
with hope and joy, had by the force of
his arm, almo&s;t wrenched from its fa&s;|tening,
one of the iron bars of the grate;
his foot was lifted to the &s;tanchion,
ready to aid him in e&s;caping through
the opening, when he was &s;eized by the
guards of the Baron, and conveyed pre|cipitately
from the pri&s;on. He was led,
indignant and de&s;perate, to the lofty
ramparts of the ca&s;tle, from whence he
beheld Alleyn and his clan, who&s;e eager
eyes were once more ble&s;&s;ed with the
&s;ight of their Chief;&mdash;they were ble&s;&s;ed
but for a moment; they beheld their
Lord in chains, &s;urrounded with guards,
and with the in&s;truments of death. Ani|mated,
however, with a la&s;t hope, they
renewed the attack with redoubled fury,
when the trumpets of the Baron &s;ounded
a parley, and they &s;u&s;pended their arms.
<PB N="97" REF="111">
The Baron appeared on the ramparts;
Alleyn advanced to hear him. "The
moment of attack," cried the Baron,
"is the moment of death to your Chief.
If you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve his life, de&s;i&s;t
from the a&s;&s;ault,' and depart in peace;
and bear this me&s;&s;age to the Counte&s;s,
your mi&s;tre&s;s:&mdash;the Baron Malcolm
will accept no other ran&s;om for the life
and the liberty of the Earl, than her
beauteous daughter, whom he now &s;ues
to become his wife. If &s;he accedes to
the&s;e terms, the Earl is in&s;tantly libera|ted,
&mdash;if &s;he refu&s;es,&mdash;he dies." The
emotions of the Earl, and of Alleyn, on
hearing the&s;e words, were inexpre&s;&s;ible.
The Earl &s;purned with haughty virtue,
the ba&s;e conce&s;&s;ion. "Give me death,"
cried he with loud impatience; "the
hou&s;e of Athlin &s;hall not be di&s;honoured
by alliance with a murderer: renew the
attack my brave people; &s;ince you can|not
&s;ave the life, revenge the death of
your Chief; he dies contented, &s;ince his
<PB N="98" REF="112">
death pre&s;erves his family from di&s;ho|nour."
The guards in&s;tantly &s;urrounded
the Earl.</P>
<P>Alleyn, who&s;e heart, torn by con|tending
emotions, was yet true to the
impul&s;e of honour, on ob&s;erving this,
in&s;tantly threw down his arms, refu&s;ing
to obey the commands of the Earl; a
ho&s;tage for who&s;e life he demanded,
while he ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle of Athlin
with the conditions of the Baron. The
clan, following the example of Alleyn,
re&s;ted on their arms, while a few pre|pared
to depart with him on the em|ba&s;&s;y.
In vain were the remon&s;trances
and the commands of the Earl, his peo|ple
loved him too well to obey them,
and his heart was filled with angui&s;h
when he &s;aw Alleyn depart from the
walls.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Alleyn was highly
pitiable; all the firm virtues of his &s;oul
<PB N="99" REF="113">
were called upon to &s;upport it. He was
commi&s;&s;ioned on an emba&s;&s;y, the alter|nate
conditions of which, would bring
de&s;truction on the woman he adored, or
death to the friend whom he loved.</P>
<P>When the arrival of Alleyn was an|nounced
to the Counte&s;s, impatient joy
thrilled in her bo&s;om; for &s;he had no
doubt that he brought offers of accom|modation;
and no ran&s;om was pre|&s;ented
to her imagination, which &s;he
would not willingly give for the resto|ration
of her &s;on. At the &s;ound of Al|leyn's
voice, tho&s;e tumults which had
began to &s;ub&s;ide in the heart of Mary,
were again revived, and &s;he awoke to
the mournful certainty of hopele&s;s en|deavour.
Yet &s;he could not repre&s;s a
&s;trong emotion of joy on again behold|ing
him. The &s;oft blu&s;h of her cheek
&s;hewed the colours of her mind, while
in endeavouring to &s;hade her feelings
&s;he impelled them into &s;tronger light.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="114">
The agitations of Alleyn almo&s;t &s;ub|dued
his &s;trength, when he entered the
pre&s;ence of the Counte&s;s; and his vi|&s;age,
on which was impre&s;&s;ed deep di&s;|tre&s;s,
and the palene&s;s of fear, betrayed
the inward workings of his &s;oul. Ma|tilda
was in&s;tantly &s;eized with appre|hen&s;ion
for the &s;afety of her &s;on, and
in a tremulous voice, enquired his
fate. Alleyn told her he was well, pro|ceeding
with tender caution to acquaint
her with the bu&s;ine&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y,
and with the &s;cene to which he had
lately been witne&s;s. The &s;entence of
the Baron fell like the &s;troke of death
upon the heart of Mary, who fainted at
the words. Alleyn flew to &s;upport her.
In endeavouring to revive her daugh|ter,
the Counte&s;s was diverted for a
time from the angui&s;h which this intel|ligence
mu&s;t naturally impart. It was
long ere Mary returned to life, and &s;he
returned only to a &s;en&s;e of wretched|ne&s;s.
The critical &s;ituation of Matilda
<PB N="101" REF="115">
can &s;carcely be felt in its full extent.
Torn by the conflict of oppo&s;ite inte|re&s;ts,
her brain was the &s;eat of tumult,
and wild di&s;may. Which ever way &s;he
looked, de&s;truction clo&s;ed the view. The
murderer of the hu&s;band, now &s;ought
to murder the happine&s;s of the daugh|ter.
On the &s;entence of the mother,
hung the final fate of the &s;on. In re|jecting
the&s;e terms, &s;he would give him
in&s;tant death; in accepting them, her
conduct would be repugnant to the
feelings of indignant virtue, and to the
tender injured memory of her mur|dered
Lord. She would de&s;troy for
ever the peace of her daughter, and the
honour of her hou&s;e. To effect his de|liverance
by force of arms was uttterly
impracticable, &s;ince the Baron had de|clared,
that "the moment of attack
&s;hould be the moment of death to the
Earl." Honour, humanity, parental
tenderne&s;s, bade her &s;ave her &s;on; yet
by a &s;trange contrariety of intere&s;ts, the
<PB N="102" REF="116">
&s;ame virtues pleaded with a voice equal|ly
powerful, for the rever&s;e of the &s;en|tence.
Hitherto hope had &s;till illu|mined
her mind with a di&s;tant ray; &s;he
now found her&s;elf &s;uddenly involved in
the darkne&s;s of de&s;pair, who&s;e glooms
were interrupted only by the gleams of
horror which aro&s;e from the altar, on
which was to be &s;acrificed one of her
beloved children. Her mind &s;hrunk
from the idea of uniting her daughter
to the murderer of her father. The
ferocious character of Malcolm was
alone &s;ufficient to blight for ever the
happine&s;s of the woman who&s;e fate
&s;hould be connected with his. To give
to the murderer the child of the mur|dered,
was a thought too horrid to re&s;t
upon. The Counte&s;s rejected with
force the Baron's offer of exchange,
when the bleeding figure of her be|loved
&s;on, pale and convul&s;ed in death,
&s;tarted on her imagination, and &s;tretched
her brain almo&s;t to frenzy.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="117">
Meanwhile Mary &s;uffered a conflict
equally dreadful. Nature had be&s;towed
on her a heart &s;u&s;ceptible of all the fine
emotions of delicate pa&s;&s;ion; a heart
which vibrated in uni&s;on with the
&s;weete&s;t feelings of humanity; a mind,
quick in perceiving the nice&s;t lines of
moral rectitude, and &s;trenuous in en|deavouring
to act up to its perceptions.
The&s;e gi&s;ts were unnece&s;&s;ary to make
her &s;en&s;ible of the wretchedne&s;s of her
pre&s;ent &s;ituation; of which a common
mind would have felt the mi&s;ery; they
&s;erved, however, to &s;harpen the points
of affliction, to encrea&s;e their force, and
to di&s;clo&s;e in &s;tronger light, the various
horrors of her &s;ituation. Fraternal love
and pity called loudly upon her to re&s;ign
her&s;elf into the power of the man, whom
from the earlie&s;t dawn of perception,
&s;he had contemplated with trembling
aver&s;ion and horror. The memory of
her murdered parent, every feeling dear
to virtue, the tremulous, but forceful
<PB N="104" REF="118">
voice of love awakened her heart, and
each oppo&s;ed with wild impetuo&s;ity,
every other &s;entiment. Her &s;oul &s;hrunk
back with terror from the idea of union
with the Baron. Could &s;he bear to re|ceive
in marriage, that hand which was
&s;tained with the blood of her father?&mdash;The
polluted touch would freeze her
heart in horror!&mdash;Could &s;he bear to pa&s;s
her life with the man, who had for ever
bla&s;ted the &s;miling days of him who
gave her being?&mdash;With the man who
would &s;tand before her eyes a perpetual
monument of mi&s;ery to her&s;elf, and of
di&s;honour to her family? who&s;e chilling
a&s;pect would repel every amiable and
generous affection, and &s;trike them back
upon her heart only to wound it? To
cheri&s;h the love of the noble virtues,
would be to cheri&s;h the remembrance of
her dead father, and of her living lover.
How wretched mud be her &s;ituation,
when to obliterate from her memory
the image of virtue, could alone afford
<PB N="105" REF="119">
her a chance of obtaining a horrid tran|quillity;
virtue, which is &s;o dear to the
human heart, that when her form for|&s;akes
us, we pur&s;ue her &s;hadow. Where|ever
in &s;earch of comfort &s;he directed
her aching &s;ight, Mi&s;ery's haggard
countenance obtruded on her view.
Here &s;he beheld her&s;elf entombed in the
arms of the murderer;&mdash;there, the &s;pec|tacle
of her beloved brother, encircled
with chains, and awaiting the &s;troke of
death, aro&s;e to her imagination; the
&s;cene was too affecting; fancy gave her
the horrors of reality. The reflection,
that through her, he &s;uffered, that
&s;he yet might &s;ave him from de&s;truction,
broke with irre&s;i&s;tible force upon her
mind, and in&s;tantly bore, away every op|po&s;ing
feeling. She re&s;olved, that &s;ince
&s;he mu&s;t be wretched, &s;he would be no|bly
wretched; &s;ince mi&s;ery demanded
one &s;acrifice, &s;he would devote her&s;elf
the victim.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="120">
With the&s;e thoughts, &s;he entered the
apartment of the Counte&s;s, who&s;e con|currence
was nece&s;&s;ary to ratify her
re&s;olves, and, having declared them,
awaited in trembling expectation her
deci&s;ion. Matilda had &s;uffered a di&s;trac|tion
of mind, which the nature of no
former trial had occa&s;ioned her. On
the unfortunate death of a hu&s;band ten|derly
beloved, &s;he had &s;uffered all the
&s;orrow which tenderne&s;s, and all the
&s;hock which the manner of his death
could in&s;pire. The event, however,
&s;hocking as it was, did not hang upon
circum&s;tances over which &s;he had an
influence; it was decided by an higher
power;&mdash;it was decided, and never could
be recalled; &s;he had there no dreadful
choice of horrors, no evil ratified by her
own voice, to taint with deadly recol|lections
her declining days. This
choice, though forced upon her by the
power of a tyrant, &s;he would &s;till con&s;i|der
as in part her own, and the thought
<PB N="107" REF="121">
that &s;he was compelled to doom to de|&s;truction
one of her children, harrowed
up her foul almo&s;t to frenzy.</P>
<P>Her mind at length exhau&s;ted with
exce&s;s of feeling, was now fallen into a
&s;tate of cold and &s;ilent de&s;pair; &s;he be
came in&s;en&s;ible to the objects around her,
almo&s;t to the &s;en&s;e of her own &s;ufferings,
and the voice, and the propo&s;al of her
daughter, &s;carcely awakened her powers
of perception. "He &s;hall live," &s;aid
Mary, in a voice broken and tender;
"he &s;hall live, I am ready to become
the &s;acrifice." Tears prevented her pro|ceeding.
At the word "live," the
Counte&s;s rai&s;ed her eyes, and threw
round her a look of wildne&s;s, which &s;et|tling
on the features of Mary, &s;oftened
into an expre&s;&s;ion of ineffable tender|ne&s;s,
&s;he waved her head, and turned to
the window. A few tears bedewed her
cheek; they fell like the drops of Hea|ven
upon the withered plant, reviving
<PB N="108" REF="122">
and expanding its dying foliage; they
were the fir&s;t her eyes had known &s;ince
the fatal news had reached her. Reco|vering
her&s;elf a little, &s;he &s;ent for Al|leyn,
who was &s;till in the ca&s;tle. She
wi&s;hed to con&s;ult with him whether
there was not yet a po&s;&s;ibility of effect|ing
the e&s;cape of the Earl. In afflicti|ons
of whatever degree, where death
has not already fixed the events in cer|tainty,
the mind &s;hoots almo&s;t beyond
the &s;phere of po&s;&s;ibility in &s;earch of
hope, and &s;eldom relinqui&s;hes the fond
illu&s;ion, till the &s;troke of reality di&s;&s;olves
the enchantment. Thus it was with
Matilda; after the grief produced by
the fir&s;t &s;troke of this di&s;a&s;ter was &s;ome|what
abated, &s;he was inclined to think
that her &s;ituation might not prove &s;o
de&s;perate as &s;he imagined; and her
heart was warmed by a remote hope,
that there might yet be devi&s;ed &s;ome
method of procuring the e&s;cape of the
Earl. Alleyn came; he came in the
<PB N="109" REF="123">
trembling expectation of receiving the
deci&s;ion of the Counte&s;s, and in the in|tention
of offering to engage in any en|terprize,
however hazardous, for the
enlargement of the Earl. He repelled
with in&s;tant force, every idea of Mary's
becoming the wife of Malcolm; the
thought was too full of agony to be en|dured,
and he threw the &s;en&s;ation from
his heart as a poi&s;on which would de&s;troy
the pul&s;e of life. To pre&s;erve Mary
from a mi&s;ery &s;o exqui&s;ite, and to &s;ave
the life of the Earl, he was willing to
encounter any hazard; to meet death
it&s;elf as an evil which appeared. le&s;s
dreadful than either of the former. He
came prepared with this re&s;olution, and
it &s;erved to &s;upport that fortitude which
affliction had di&s;turbed, though it could
not &s;ubdue. When he came again to
the Counte&s;s, his di&s;tre&s;s was heightened
by the &s;cene before him; he beheld her
leaning on a &s;ofa, pale and &s;ilent; her
uncon&s;cious eyes were fixed on an op|po&s;ite
<PB N="110" REF="124">
window; her countenance was
touched with a wildne&s;s expre&s;&s;ive of
the di&s;order of her mind, and &s;he re|mained
for &s;ome time in&s;en&s;ible of his
approach. Such is the fluctuation of a
mind overcome by di&s;tre&s;s, that if for a
moment a ray of hope chears its dark|ne&s;s,
it vani&s;hes at the touch of recollec|tion.
Mary was &s;tanding near the Coun|te&s;s,
who&s;e hand &s;he held to her bo&s;om.
Her pre&s;ent &s;orrow had heightened the
natural pen&s;ivene&s;s of her countenance,
and &s;haded her features with an intere&s;t|ing
langour, more enchanting than the
vivacity of blooming health; her eyes
&s;ought to avoid Alleyn, as an object
dangerous to the re&s;olution &s;he had
formed. Matilda remained ab&s;orbed in
thought. Mary wi&s;hed to repeat the
purpo&s;e of her &s;oul, but her voice trem|bled,
and the half formed &s;entence died
away on her lips. Alleyn enquired the
commands of the Counte&s;s. "I am
ready," &s;aid Mary, at length, in a low
<PB N="111" REF="125">
and tremulous voice, "to give my&s;elf
the victim to the Baron's revenge.&mdash;I
will &s;ave my brother." At the&s;e words,
the heart of Alleyn grew cold. Mary,
overcome by the effort which they had
occa&s;ioned her, &s;carcely fini&s;hed the &s;en|tence;
her nerves &s;hook, a mi&s;t fell
over her eye, and &s;he &s;unk on the &s;ofa
by which &s;he &s;tood. Alleyn hung over
the couch in &s;ilent agony, watching her
return to life. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e
about her, &s;he &s;oon revived. Alleyn, in
the joy which he felt at her recovery,
forgot for a moment his &s;ituation, and
pre&s;&s;ed with ardor her hand to his
bo&s;om. Mary, who&s;e &s;en&s;es were yet
&s;carcely recollected, yielded uncon&s;ci|ou&s;ly
to the &s;oftne&s;s of her heart, and
betrayed its &s;ituation by a &s;mile &s;o ten|der
as to thrill the brea&s;t of Alleyn with
the &s;weet certainty of being loved. Hi|therto
his pa&s;&s;ion had been chilled by
the de&s;pair which the va&s;t &s;uperiority
of her birth occa&s;ioned, and by the mo|de&s;ty
<PB N="112" REF="126">
which forbad him to imagine that
he had merit &s;ufficient to arre&s;t the eye
of the accompli&s;hed Mary. Perhaps,
too, the diffidence natural to genuine
love, might contribute to deceive him.
It was not till this moment, that he ex|perienced
that certainty which awaken|ed
in his heart, a &s;en&s;e of delight hither|to
unknown to him. For a moment he
forgot the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the ca&s;tle, and his
own &s;ituation; every idea faded from
his mind, but the one he had &s;o lately
acquired; and in that moment he
&s;eemed to ta&s;te perfect felicity. Re|collection,
however, with all its train
of black dependencies &s;oon returned,
and plunged him in a mi&s;ery as poig|nant
as the joy from which he was now precipitated.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was now &s;ufficiently
compo&s;ed to enter on the &s;ubject neare&s;t
her heart. Alleyn caught with eager|ne&s;s,
her mention of attempting the
<PB N="113" REF="127">
deliverance of the Earl, for the po&s;&s;i|bility
of accompli&s;hing which, he de|clared
him&s;elf willing to encounter any
danger: he &s;econded &s;o warmly the
de&s;ign, and &s;poke with &s;uch flattering
probability of &s;ucce&s;s, that the &s;pirits
of Matilda began once more to revive;
yet &s;he trembled to encourage hopes
which hung on &s;uch perilous uncer|tainty.
It was agreed, that Alleyn
&s;hould con&s;ult with the mo&s;t able and
tru&s;ty of the clan, whom age or infir|mity
had detained from battle, on the
means mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure. &s;ucce&s;s,
and then proceed immediately on the
expedition: having fir&s;t delivered to
the Baron a me&s;&s;age from the Counte&s;s,
requiring time for deliberation upon a
choice &s;o important, and importing that
an an&s;wer &s;hould be returned at the ex|piration
of a fortnight.</P>
<P>Alleyn accordingly a&s;&s;embled tho&s;e
whom he judged mo&s;t worthy of the
<PB N="114" REF="128">
council: various &s;chemes were pro|po&s;ed,
none of which appeared likely to
&s;ucceed; when it was recollected that
the Earl might po&s;&s;ibly have been re|moved
from the tower to &s;ome new
place of confinement, which it would
be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to di&s;cover, that the
plan might be adapted to the &s;ituation.
It was therefore concluded to &s;u&s;pend
further con&s;ultation till Alleyn had ob|tained
the requi&s;ite information; and
that in the mean time he &s;hould deliver
to Malcolm, the me&s;&s;age of the Coun|te&s;s:
for the&s;e purpo&s;es Alleyn imme|diately
&s;et out for the ca&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;tle of Dunbayne was &s;till
the &s;cene of triumph, and of
wretchedne&s;s. Malcolm, exulting in
his &s;cheme, already beheld Mary at his
feet, and the Earl retiring in an angui&s;h
more poignant than that of death. He
was &s;urprized that his invention had
not before &s;upplied him with this means
of torture: for the fir&s;t time he wel|comed
love, as the in&s;trument of his
revenge; and the charms of Mary were
heightened to his imagination by the
ardent colours of this pa&s;&s;ion. He was
confirmed in his re&s;olves, never to re|linqui&s;h
the Earl, but on the conditions
he had offered; and thus for ever would
he pre&s;erve the hou&s;e of Athlin a monu|ment
of his triumph.</P>
<P>O&s;bert, for greater &s;ecurity, was con|veyed
from the tower into a more cen|trical
<PB N="116" REF="130">
part of the ca&s;tle, to an apartment
&s;pacious but gloomy, who&s;e gothic win|dows
partly excluding light, threw a
&s;olemnity around, which chilled the
heart alrno&s;t to horror. He heeded not
this; his heart was occupied with hor|rors
of its own. He was now involved
in a mi&s;ery more intricate, and more
dreadful, than his imagination had yet
painted. To die, was to him, who had
&s;o long contemplated the near approach
of death, a familiar and tran&s;ient evil;
but to &s;ee, even in idea, his family in|volved
in infamy, and in union; with the
murderer, was the &s;troke which pierced
his heart to its center. He feared that
the cruel tenderne&s;s of the mother,
would tempt Matilda to accept the
offers of the Baron; and he &s;carcely
doubted, that the noble Mary would
re&s;ign her&s;elf the price of his life. He
would have written to the Counte&s;s to
have forbidden her acceptance of the
terms, and to have declared his fixed
<PB N="117" REF="131">
re&s;olution to die, but that he had no
means of conveying to her a letter; the
&s;oldier who had &s;o generou&s;ly under|taken
the conveyance of his former one,
having &s;oon after di&s;appeared from his
&s;tation. The manly fortitude which
had &s;upported him through his former
trials, did not de&s;ert him in this hour
of darkne&s;s; habituated &s;o long to &s;trug|gle
with oppo&s;ing feelings, he had ac|quired
the art of managing them; his
mind attained a confidence in its pow|ers
re&s;i&s;tance &s;erved only to increa&s;e
its &s;trength, and to confirm the magna|nimity
of its nature.</P>
<P>Alleyn had now joined the clan, and
was ardent in pur&s;uit of the nece&s;&s;ary
intelligence. He learned that the Earl
had been removed from the tower, but
in what part of the ca&s;tle he was now
confined he could not di&s;cover; on this
point all was vague conjecture. That
he was alive, was only judged from the
<PB N="118" REF="132">
policy of the Baron, who&s;e ardent pa&s;|&s;ion
for Mary, was now well under|&s;tood.
Alleyn employed every &s;trata|gem
his invention could &s;ugge&s;t, to di&s;|cover
the pri&s;on of the Earl, but with|out
&s;ucce&s;s: at length, compelled to
deliver to Malcolm the me&s;&s;age of the
Counte&s;s, he demanded, as a prelimi|nary,
that the Earl &s;hould be &s;hewn to
his people from the ramparts, that they
might be certain he was &s;till alive. Al|leyn
hoped that his appearance would
lead to a di&s;covery of the place of his
impri&s;onment, purpo&s;ing to ob&s;erve nar|rowly
the way by which he &s;hould re|tire.</P>
<P>The Earl appeared in &s;afety on the
ramparts, amid the &s;houts and acclama|tions
of his people; the Baron, frown|ing
defiance, was &s;een at his &s;ide. Al|leyn
advanced to the walls, and deli|vered
the me&s;&s;age of Matilda. O&s;bert
&s;tarted at its purpo&s;e; he fore&s;aw that
<PB N="119" REF="133">
deliberation portended compliance:&mdash;&s;tung
with the thought, he &s;wore aloud
he never would &s;urvive the infamy of
the conce&s;&s;ion; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
to Alleyn, commanded him in&s;tantly to
return to the Counte&s;s, and bid her
&s;purn the ba&s;e compliance, as &s;he feared
to &s;acrifice both the children to the
murderer of the father. At the&s;e words,
a &s;mile of haughty triumph marked the
features of the Baron, and he turned
from O&s;bert in &s;ilent exultation. The
Earl was led off by the guards. Alleyn
endeavoured in vain to mark the way
they took; the lofty walls &s;oon con|cealed
them from his view.</P>
<P>Alleyn now experienced how &s;trenu|ou&s;ly
a vigorous mind protects its fa|vourite
hope; wayward circum&s;tances
may &s;hock, di&s;appointment may check
it; but it ri&s;es &s;uperior to oppo&s;ition,
and traver&s;es the &s;phere of po&s;&s;ibility to
accompli&s;h its purpo&s;e. Alleyn did not
<PB N="120" REF="134">
yet de&s;pair, but he was perplexed in
what manner to proceed.</P>
<P>In his way from the ramparts, O&s;bert
was &s;urprized by the appearance of two
ladies at a window near which he
pa&s;&s;ed: the agitation of his mind did
not prevent his recognizing them as the
&s;ame he had ob&s;erved from the grates of
the tower, with &s;uch lively admiration,
and who had excited in his mind &s;o
much of pity and of curio&s;ity. In the
mid&s;t of his di&s;tre&s;s, his thoughts had
often dwelt on the &s;weet graces of the
younger, and had &s;ighed to obtain the
&s;tory of her &s;orrows; for the melan|choly
which hung upon her features
proclaimed her to be unfortunate. They
now &s;tood ob&s;erving O&s;bert as he pa&s;&s;ed,
and their eyes expre&s;&s;ed the pity which
his &s;ituation in&s;pired. He gazed ear|ne&s;tly
and mournfully upon them, and
when he entered his pri&s;on, again en|quired
concerning them, but the &s;ame
<PB N="121" REF="135">
inflexible &s;ilence was pre&s;erved on the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>As the Earl &s;at one day mu&s;ing in
his pri&s;on, his eyes involuntarily fixed
upon a pannel in the oppo&s;ite wain&s;cot;
&mdash;he ob&s;erved that it was differently
formed from the re&s;t, and that its pro|jection
was &s;omewhat greater; a hope
&s;tarted into his mind, and he quitted his
&s;eat to examine it. He perceived that
it was &s;urrounded by a &s;mall crack, and
on pu&s;hing it with his hands it &s;hook
under them. Certain that it was &s;ome|thing
more than a pannel, he exerted
all his &s;trength again&s;t it, but without
producing any new effect. Having
tried various means to move it without
&s;ucce&s;s, he gave up the experiment, and
returned to his &s;eat melancholy and di&s;|appointed.
Several days pa&s;&s;ed with|out
any further notice being taken of
the wain&s;cot; unwilling, however, to
relinqui&s;h a la&s;t hope he returned to
<PB N="122" REF="136">
the examination, when in endeavouring
to remove the pannel, his foot acci|dentally
hit again&s;t one corner, and it
&s;uddenly flew open. It had been con|trived
that a &s;pring which was concealed
within, and which fa&s;tened the partition,
&s;hould receive its impul&s;e from the
pre&s;&s;ure of a certain part of the pannel,
which was now touched by the foot of
the Earl. His joy on the di&s;covery
cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. An apartment
wide and forlorn, like that which formed
his pri&s;on, now lay before him; the
windows, which were high and arched,
were decorated with painted gla&s;s; the
floor was paved with marble; and it
&s;eemed to be the de&s;erted remains of a
place of wor&s;hip. O&s;bert traver&s;ed,
with he&s;itating &s;teps, its dreary length,
towards a pair of folding doors, large
and of oak, which clo&s;ed the apartment:
the&s;e he opened; a gallery gloomy and
va&s;t, appeared beyond; the windows,
which were in the &s;ame &s;tyle of Gothic
<PB N="123" REF="137">
architecture with the former, were
&s;haded by thick ivy that almo&s;t ex|cluded
the light. O&s;bert &s;tood at the
entrance, uncertain whether to pro|ceed;
he li&s;tened, but heard no foot|&s;tep
in his pri&s;on, and determined to go
on. The gallery terminated on the left
in a large winding flair-ca&s;e, old and
apparently neglected, which led to a
hall below; on the right was a door,
low, and rather ob&s;cure. O&s;bert, ap|prehen&s;ive
of di&s;covery, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tair|ca&s;e,
and opened the door, when a &s;uite
of noble apartments, magnificently fur|ni&s;hed,
was di&s;clo&s;ed to his wondering
eyes. He proceeded onward without
perceiving any per&s;on, but having
pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd room, heard the faint
&s;obs of a per&s;on weeping; he flood for
a moment, undetermined whether to
proceed, but an irre&s;i&s;tible curio&s;ity im|pelled
him forward, and he entered an
apartment, in which were &s;eated the
beautiful &s;trangers, who&s;e appearance
<PB N="124" REF="138">
had &s;o much intere&s;ted his feelings.
The elder of the ladies was di&s;&s;olved in
tears, and a ca&s;ket and &s;ome papers lay
open on a table be&s;ide her. The younger
was &s;o intent upon a drawing, which &s;he
&s;eemed to be fini&s;hing, as not to ob&s;erve
the entrance of the Earl. The elder
lady on perceiving him, aro&s;e in &s;ome
confu&s;ion, and the &s;urprize in her eyes
&s;eemed to demand an explanation of &s;o
unaccountable a vi&s;it. The Earl &s;ur|prized
at what he beheld, &s;tepped back
with an intention of retiring; but recol|lecting
that the intru&s;ion demanded an
apology, he returned. The grace with
which he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, confirmed
the impre&s;&s;ion which his figure had al|ready
made on the mind of Laura,
which was the name of the younger
lady; who on looking up, di&s;covered a
countenance in which dignity and &s;weet|ne&s;s
were happily blended. She ap|peared
to be about twenty, her per&s;on
was of the middle &s;tature, extremely
<PB N="125" REF="139">
delicate, and very elegantly formed.
The bloom of her youth was &s;haded by
a &s;oft and pen&s;ive melancholy, which
communicated an expre&s;&s;ion to her fine
blue eyes, extremely intere&s;ting. Her
features were partly concealed by the
beautiful luxuriance of her auburn hair,
which curling round her face, de&s;cended
in tre&s;&s;es on her bo&s;om; every feminine
grace played around her; and the &s;imple
dignity of her air declared the purity and
the nobility of her mind. On perceiving
the Earl, a faint blu&s;h animated her
cheek, and &s;he involuntarily quitted the
drawing upon which &s;he had been
engaged.</P>
<P>If the former imperfect view he had
caught of Laura had given an impre&s;|&s;ion
to the heart of O&s;bert, it now re|ceived
a &s;tronger character from the op|portunity
afforded him of contemplat|ing
her beauty. He concluded that
the Baron, attracted by her charms, had
<PB N="126" REF="140">
entrapped her into his power, and de|tained
her in the ca&s;tle an unwilling
pri&s;oner. In this conjecture he was
confirmed by the mournful ca&s;t of her
countenance, and by the my&s;tery which
appeared to &s;urround her. Fired by
this idea, he melted in compa&s;&s;ion for
her &s;ufferings; which compa&s;&s;ion was
tinctured and encrea&s;ed by the pa&s;&s;ion
which now glowed in his heart. At
that moment he forgot the danger of his
pre&s;ent &s;ituation; he forgot even that
he was a pri&s;oner; and awake only to
the wi&s;h of alleviating her &s;orrows, he
rejected cold and u&s;ele&s;s delicacy, and
re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to learn the cau&s;e
of her misfortunes. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
to the Barone&s;s, "if Madam," &s;aid he,
"I could by any means &s;often the af|fliction
which I cannot affect not to per|ceive,
and which has &s;o warmly inte|re&s;ted
my feelings, I &s;hould regard this
as one of the mo&s;t happy moments of
my life; a life marked, alas! too &s;trong|ly
<PB N="127" REF="141">
with mi&s;ery! but mi&s;ery has not been
u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince it has taught me &s;ympa|thy."
The Barone&s;s was no &s;tranger to
the character and the misfortunes of the
Earl. Her&s;elf the victim of oppre&s;&s;ion,
&s;he knew how to commi&s;erate the &s;uffer|ings
of others. She had ever felt a tender
compa&s;&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of O&s;bert,
and did not now with-hold &s;incere ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of &s;ympathy, and of gratitude,
for the intere&s;t which he felt in her &s;or|row.
She expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize at
&s;eeing him thus at liberty; but ob&s;erving
the chains which encircled his hands,
&s;he &s;huddered, and gue&s;&s;ed a part of the
truth. He explained to her the di&s;co|very
of the pannel, by which ciircum|&s;tance
he had found his way into that
apartment. The idea of aiding him to
e&s;cape, ru&s;hed upon the mind of the
Barone&s;s, but was repre&s;&s;ed by the con|&s;ideration
of her own confined &s;ituation;
and &s;he was compelled with mournful
reluctance; to re&s;ign that thought which
<PB N="128" REF="142">
reverence for the character of the late
Earl, and compa&s;&s;ion for the misfortunes
of the pre&s;ent, had in&s;pired. She la|mented
her inability to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and
informed him that her&s;elf and her
daughter were alike pri&s;oners with him|&s;elf;
that the walls of the ca&s;tle were
the limits of their liberty; and that they
had &s;uffered the pre&s;&s;ure of tyranny for
fifteen years. The Earl expre&s;&s;ed the
indignation which he felt at this reci|tal,
and &s;olicited the Barone&s;s to con&s;ide
in his integrity; and, if the relation
would not be too painful to her, to ho|nour
him &s;o far as to acquaint him by
what cruel means &s;he fell into the power
of Malcolm. The Barone&s;s, apprehen|&s;ive
for his &s;afety, reminded him of the
ri&s;k of di&s;covery by a longer ab&s;ence
from his pri&s;on; and, thanking him
again for the intere&s;t he took in her &s;uf|ferings,
a&s;&s;ured him of her warme&s;t
wi&s;hes for his deliverance, and that if
an opportunity ever offered, &s;he would
<PB N="129" REF="143">
acquaint him with the &s;ad particulars or
her &s;tory. The eyes of O&s;bert made
known that gratitude which it was diffi|cult
for his tongue to utter. Tremu|lou&s;ly
he &s;olicited the con&s;olation of
&s;ometimes re-vi&s;iting the apartments of
the Barone&s;s; a permi&s;&s;ion which would
give him &s;ome intervals of comfort
amid the many hours of torment to
which he was condemned. The Ba|rone&s;s,
in compa&s;&s;ion to his &s;ufferings,
granted the reque&s;t. The Earl de|parted,
gazing on Laura with eyes of
mournful tenderne&s;s; yet he was plea&s;ed
with what had pa&s;&s;ed, and retired to his
pri&s;on in one of tho&s;e peaceful inter|vals
which are known even to the
wretched. He found all quiet, and
clo&s;ing the pannel in &s;afety, &s;at down to
con&s;ider the pa&s;t, and anticipate the fu|ture.
He was flattered with hopes, that
the di&s;covery of the pannel might aid
him to e&s;cape; the glooms of de&s;pond|ence
which had lately enveloped his
<PB N="130" REF="144">
mind, gradually di&s;appeared, and joy
once more illumined his pro&s;pects; but
it was the &s;un&s;hine of an April morn,
deceitful and momentary. He recol|lected
that the ca&s;tle was be&s;et with
guards, who&s;e vigilance was in&s;ured by
the &s;everity of the Baron; he remem|bered
that the &s;trangers, who had took
&s;o kind an intere&s;t in his fate, were pri|&s;oners
like him&s;elf; and that he had no
generous &s;oldier to teach him the &s;ecret
windings of the ca&s;tle, and to accompa|pany
him in flight. His imagination
was haunted by the image of Laura;
vainly he &s;trove to di&s;gui&s;e from him|&s;elf
the truth; his heart con&s;tantly be|lied
the &s;ophi&s;try of his rea&s;onings. Un|warily
he had drank the draught of
love, and he was compelled to acknow|ledge
the fatal indi&s;cretion. He could
not, however, re&s;olve to throw from his
heart the delicious poi&s;on; he could
not re&s;olve to &s;ee her no more. The
painful apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety,
<PB N="131" REF="145">
which his forbearing to renew the vi&s;it
he had &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicited, would oc|ca&s;ion
the Barone&s;s; the apparent di&s;|re&s;pect
it would convey; the ardent
curio&s;ity with which he longed to ob|tain
the hi&s;tory of her misfortunes; the
lively intere&s;t he felt in learning the
&s;ituation of Laura, with re&s;pect to the
Baron; and the hope,&mdash;the wild hope,
with which he deluded his rea&s;on, that
he might be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, deter|mined
him to repeat the vi&s;it. Under
the&s;e illu&s;ions, the motive which princi|pally
impelled him to the interview
was concealed.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alleyn had re|turned
to the ca&s;tle of Athlin with the
re&s;olutions of the Earl; who&s;e re&s;olves
&s;erved only to aggravate the di&s;tre&s;s of
its fair inhabitants. Alleyn, however,
unwilling to cru&s;h a la&s;t hope, tenderly
concealed from them the circum&s;tance
of the Earl's removal from the tower;
<PB N="132" REF="146">
&s;ilently and almo&s;t hopele&s;sly meditating
to di&s;cover his pri&s;on; and admini|&s;tered
that comfort to the Counte&s;s and
to Mary, which his own expectation
would not &s;uffer him to participate. He
retired in ha&s;te to the veterans whom
he had before a&s;&s;embled, and acquaint|ed
them with the removal of the Earl;
which circum&s;tance mu&s;t for the pre|&s;ent
&s;u&s;pend their con&s;ultations. He
left them, therefore, and in&s;tantly re|turned
to the clan: there to pro&s;ecute
his enquiries. Every po&s;&s;ible exertion
was made to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary intel|ligence,
but without &s;ucce&s;s. The
moment in which the Baron would de|mand
the an&s;wer of the Counte&s;s, was
now fa&s;t approaching, and every heart
&s;unk in de&s;pair, when one night the cen|tinels
of the camp were alarmed by the
approach of men, who hailed them in
unknown voices; fearful of &s;urprize,
they &s;urrounded the &s;trangers, and led
them to Alleyn; to whom they related,
<PB N="133" REF="147">
that they fled from the capricious tyran|ny
of Malcolm, and &s;ought refuge in
the camp of his enemy; who&s;e misfor|tunes
they bewailed, and in who&s;e cau&s;e
they enli&s;ted. Rejoiced at the circum|&s;tance,
yet doubtful of its truth, Alleyn
interrogated the &s;oldiers concerning the
pri&s;on of the Earl. From them he
learned, that O&s;bert was confined in a
part of the ca&s;tle extremely difficult of
acce&s;s; and that any plan of e&s;cape
mu&s;t be utterly impracticable without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one well acquainted
with the various intricacies of the pile.
An opportunity of &s;ucce&s;s was now pre|&s;ented,
with which the mo&s;t &s;anguine
hopes of Alleyn had never flattered
him. He received from the &s;oldiers
&s;trong a&s;&s;urances of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; from
them, likewi&s;e, he learned, that di&s;con|tent
reigned among the people of the
Baron; who, impatient of the yoke of
tyranny, only waited a favourable op|portunity
to throw it off, and re&s;ume
<PB N="134" REF="148">
the rights of nature. That the vigilant
&s;u&s;picions of Malcolm excited him to
puni&s;h with the har&s;he&s;t &s;everity every
appearance of inattention; that being
condemned to &s;uffer a very heavy pu|ni&s;hment
for a &s;light offence, they had
eluded the impending mi&s;ery, and the
future oppre&s;&s;ion of their Chief, by
de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Alleyn immediately convened a coun|cil,
before whom the &s;oldiers were
brought; they repeated their former
a&s;&s;ertions; and one of the fugitives
added, that he had a brother, who&s;e
place of guard over the per&s;on of the
Earl on that night, had made it difficult
to elude ob&s;ervation, and had prevented
his e&s;caping with them; that on the
night of the morrow he &s;tood guard at
the gate of the le&s;&s;er draw-bridge, where
the centinels were few; that he was
him&s;elf willing to ri&s;que the danger of
conver&s;ing with him; and had litttle
<PB N="135" REF="149">
doubt of gaining him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the de|liverance
of the Earl. At the&s;e words,
the heart of Alleyn throbbed with joy.
He promi&s;ed large rewards to the brave
&s;oldier and to his brother, if they un|dertook
the enterprize. His companion
was well acquainted with the &s;ubter|raneous
pa&s;&s;ages of the rock, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf de&s;irous of being u&s;eful.
The hopes of Alleyn every in&s;tant grew
&s;tronger; and he vainly wi&s;hed at that
moment to communicate to the Earl's
unhappy family, the joy which dilated
his heart.</P>
<P>The eve of the following day was
fixed upon to commence their de&s;igns;
when James &s;hould endeavour to gain
his brother to their purpo&s;e. Having
adju&s;ted the&s;e matters, they retired to
re&s;t for the remainder of the night; but
&s;leep had fled the eyes of Alleyn; anx|ious
expectation filled his mind; and
he &s;aw in the waking vi&s;ions of fancy,
<PB N="136" REF="150">
the meeting of the Earl with his family;
he anticipated the thanks he &s;hould re|ceive
from the lovely Mary; and he
&s;ighed at the recollection, that thanks
were all for which he could ever dare to
hope.</P>
<P>At length the dawn appeared, and
waked the clan to hopes and pro&s;pects
far different from tho&s;e of the preceding
morn. The hours hung heavily on the
expectation of Alleyn, who&s;e mind was
filled with &s;olicitude for the event of the
meeting between the brothers. Night
at length came to his wi&s;hes. The
darkne&s;s was interrupted only by the
faint light of the moon moving through
the watry and broken clouds, which en|veloped
the horizon. Tumultuous gu&s;ts
of wind broke at intervals the &s;ilence of
the hour. Alleyn watched the move|ments
of the ca&s;tle; he ob&s;erved the
lights gradually di&s;appear. The bell
from the watch-tower chimed one; all
<PB N="137" REF="151">
was &s;till within the walls; and James
ventured forth to the draw-bridge. The
draw-bridge divided in the center, and
the half next the plains was down; he
mounted it, and in a low yet firm voice,
called on Edmund. No an&s;wer was re|turned;
and he began to fear that his
brother had already quitted the ca&s;tle.
He remained &s;ome time in &s;ilent &s;u&s;|pen&s;e
before he repeated the call, when
he heard the gate of the draw-bridge
gently unbarred, and Edmund appeared.
He was &s;urprized to &s;ee James, and
bade him in&s;tantly fly the danger that
&s;urrounded him. The Baron, incen&s;ed
at the frequent de&s;ertion of his &s;oldiers,
had &s;ent out people in pur&s;uit, and had
promi&s;ed con&s;iderable rewards for the
apprehen&s;ion of the fugitives. James,
undaunted by what he heard, kept his
ground, re&s;olved to urge his purpo&s;e to
the point. Happily, the centinels who
&s;tood guard with Edmund, overcome
with the effect of a potion he had admi|ni&s;tered
<PB N="138" REF="152">
to favour his e&s;cape, were &s;unk
in &s;leep, and the &s;oldiers conducted their
di&s;cour&s;e in a low voice, without inter|ruption.</P>
<P>Edmund was unwilling to defer his
flight, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not re&s;olution &s;uffi|cient
to encounter the hazard of the en|terprize,
till the proffered reward con|&s;oled
his &s;elf-denial, and rou&s;ed his
&s;lumbering courage. He was well ac|quainted
with the &s;ubterraneous avenues
of the ca&s;tle; the only remaining diffi|culty
was that of deceiving the vigi|lance
of his fellow-centinels, who&s;e
watchfulne&s;s made it impo&s;&s;ible for the
Earl to quit his pri&s;on unperceived.
The &s;oldiers who were to mount guard
with him on the following night, were
&s;tationed in a di&s;tant part of the ca&s;tle,
till the hour of their removal to the
door of the pri&s;on; it was, therefore,
difficult to admini&s;ter to them that
draught which had &s;teeped in forget|fulne&s;s
<PB N="139" REF="153">
the &s;en&s;es of his pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociates.
To confide to their integrity, and endea|vour
to win them to his purpo&s;e, was
certainly to give his life into their hands,
and probably to aggravate the di&s;a&s;trous
fate of the Earl. This &s;cheme was be|&s;et
too thick with dangers to be ha|zarded,
and their invention could fur|ni&s;h
them with none more promi&s;ing.
It was, however, agreed, that on the
following night, Edmund &s;hould &s;eize
the moment of opportunity to impart to
the Earl the de&s;igns of his friends, and
to con&s;ult on the means of accompli&s;h|ing
them. Thus concluding, James
returned in &s;afety to the tent of Alleyn,
where the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the clan
were a&s;&s;embled, there awaiting with im|patient
&s;olicitude, his arrival. The
hopes of Alleyn were &s;omewhat chilled
by the report of the &s;oldier; from the
vigilance which be&s;et the doors of the
pri&s;on, e&s;cape from thence appeared im|practicable.
He was condemned, how|ever,
<PB N="140" REF="154">
to linger in &s;u&s;pen&s;e till the third
night from the pre&s;ent, when the return
of Edmund to his &s;tation at the bridge
would enable him again to commune
with his brother. But Alleyn was un&s;u&s;|picious
of a circum&s;tance which would
utterly have defeated his hopes, and
who&s;e con&s;equence threatened de&s;truc|tion
to all their &s;chemes. A centinel
on duty upon that part of the rampart
which &s;urmounted the draw-bridge, had
been alarmed by hearing the gate unbar,
and approaching the wall, had perceived
a man &s;tanding on the half of the bridge
which was dropped, and in conver&s;e
with &s;ome per&s;on on the ca&s;tle walls.
He drew as near as the wall would per|mit,
and endeavoured to li&s;ten to their
di&s;cour&s;e. The gloom of night pre|vented
his recognizing the per&s;on on the
bridge; but he could clearly di&s;tingui&s;h
the voice of Edmund, in that of the
man to whom he addre&s;&s;d him&s;elf.
Excited by new wonder, he gave all his
<PB N="141" REF="155">
attention to di&s;cover the &s;ubject of their
conver&s;ation. The di&s;tance occa&s;ioned
between the brothers by the &s;u&s;pended
half of the bridge, obliged them to &s;peak
in a &s;omewhat higher tone than they
would otherwi&s;e have done; and the
centinel gathered &s;ufficient from their
di&s;cour&s;e, to learn that they were con|certing
the re&s;cue of the Earl; that the
night of Edmund's watch at the pri&s;on,
was to be the night of enterprize; and
that &s;ome friends of the Earl were to
await him in the environs of the ca&s;tle.
All this he carefully trea&s;ured up, and
the next morning communicated it to
his comrades.</P>
<P>On the following evening the Earl,
yielding to the impul&s;e of his heart,
once more unclo&s;ed his partition, and
&s;ought the apartments of the Barone&s;s.
She received him with expre&s;&s;ions of
&s;atisfaction; while the artle&s;s plea&s;ure
which lighted up the countenance of
<PB N="142" REF="156">
Laura, awakened the pul&s;e of rapture in
that heart which had long throbbed only
to mi&s;ery. The Earl reminded the Ba|rone&s;s
of her former promi&s;e, which the
de&s;ire of exciting &s;ympathy in tho&s;e we
e&s;teem, and the melancholy plea&s;ure
which the heart finds in lingering in the
&s;cenes of former happine&s;s, had induced
her to give. She endeavoured to com|po&s;e
her &s;pirits, which were agitated by
the remembrance of pa&s;t &s;ufferings, and
gave him a relation of the following
circum&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>LOUISA, Barone&s;s Malcolm, was
the de&s;cendant of an ancient and
honourable hou&s;e in Switzerland. Her
father, the Marquis de St. Claire, inhe|rited
all tho&s;e brave qualities and that
&s;tern virtue which had &s;o eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed
his ance&s;tors. Early in life
he lo&s;t a wife whom he tenderly loved,
and he &s;eemed to derive his &s;ole con&s;o|lation
from the education of the dear
children &s;he had left behind. His &s;on,
whom he had brought up to the arms
him&s;elf &s;o honourably bore, fell before
he reached his nineteenth year, in the
&s;ervice of his country; an elder daugh|ter
died in infancy; Loui&s;a was his &s;ole
&s;urviving child. His chateau was &s;itu|ated
in one of tho&s;e delightful vallies of
the Swi&s;s cantons, in which the beauti|ful
and the &s;ublime are &s;o happily uni|ted;
where the magnificent features of
<PB N="144" REF="158">
the &s;cenery are contra&s;ted, and their ef|fect
heightened by the blooming luxu|riance
of woods and pa&s;turage, by the
gentle windings of the &s;tream, and the
peaceful a&s;pect of the cottage. The
Marquis was now retired from the &s;er|vice,
for grey age had overtaken him.
His re&s;idence was the re&s;ort of foreign|ers
of di&s;tinction, who attracted by the
united talents of the &s;oldier and the
philo&s;opher, under his roof partook of
the ho&s;pitality &s;o characteri&s;tic of his
country. Among the vi&s;itors of this
de&s;cription, was the late Baron Mal|colm,
brother to the pre&s;ent Chief, who
then travelled through Switzerland.
The beauty of Loui&s;a, embelli&s;hed by
the elegance of a mind highly culti|vated,
touched his heart, and he &s;oli|cited
her hand in marriage. The manly
&s;en&s;e of the Baron, and the excellencies
of his di&s;po&s;ition, had not pa&s;&s;ed unob|&s;erved,
or unapproved by the Marquis;
while the graces of his per&s;on, and of
<PB N="145" REF="159">
his mind, had anticipated for him in the
heart of Loui&s;a, a pre-eminence over
every other &s;uitor. The Marquis had
but one objection to the marriage; this
was likewi&s;e the objection of Loui&s;a:
neither the one nor the other could en|dure
the idea of the di&s;tance which was
to &s;eparate them. Loui&s;a was to the
Marquis the la&s;t prop of his declining
years; the Marquis was to Loui&s;a the
father and the friend to whom her heart
had hitherto been &s;olely devoted, and
from whom it could not now be torn
but with an angui&s;h equal to its attach|ment.
This remained an in&s;urmount|able
ob&s;tacle, till it was removed by the
tenderne&s;s of the Baron, who entreated
the Marquis to quit Switzerland, and
re&s;ide with his daughter in Scotland.
The attachment of the Marquis to his
natal land, and the pride of hereditary
dominion, was too powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uffer him
to acquie&s;ce in the propo&s;al without
much &s;truggle of contending feelings.
<PB N="146" REF="160">
The de&s;ire of &s;ecuring the happine&s;s of
his child by a union with a character &s;o
excellent as the Baron's, and of &s;eeing
her &s;ettled before death &s;hould deprive
her of the protection of a father, at
length &s;ubdued every other con&s;idera|tion,
and he re&s;igned the hand of his
daughter to the Baron Malcolm. The
Marquis adju&s;ted his affairs, and con|&s;igning
his e&s;tates to the care of tru&s;ty
agents, bade a la&s;t adieu to his beloved
country;&mdash;that country, which during
&s;ixty years, had been the principal
&s;cene of his happine&s;s, and of his re|grets.
The cour&s;e of years had not ob|literated
from his heart the early affec|tions
of his youth; he took a &s;ad fare|well
of that grave which enclo&s;ed the
reliques of his wife, from which it was
not his lea&s;t effort to depart, and whi|ther
he ordered that his remains &s;hould
be conveyed. Loui&s;a quitted Switzer|land
with a concern &s;carcely le&s;s acute
than that of her father; the poignancy
<PB N="147" REF="161">
of which, however, was greatly &s;oftened
by the tender a&s;&s;iduities of her Lord,
who&s;e affectionate attentions hourly
heightened her e&s;teem, and encrea&s;ed
her love.</P>
<P>They arrived at Scotland without any
accident, where the Baron welcomed
Loui&s;a as the mi&s;tre&s;s of his domains.
The Marquis de St. Claire had apart|ments
in the cattle, where the evening
of his days declined in peaceful hap|pine&s;s.
Before his death he had the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his race renewed in
the children of the Barone&s;s, in a &s;on
who was called by the name of the Mar|quis,
and in a daughter who now &s;hares
with her mother the &s;orrows of confine|ment.
On the death of the Marquis it
was nece&s;&s;ary for the Baron to vi&s;it
Switzerland, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his e&s;tates, and to adju&s;t &s;ome affairs
which a long ab&s;ence had deranged. He
attended the remains of the Marquis to
<PB N="148" REF="162">
their la&s;t abode. The Barone&s;s, de&s;irous
of once more beholding her native coun|try,
and anxious to pay a la&s;t re&s;pect to
the memory of her father, entru&s;ted her
children to the care of a faithful old &s;er|vant,
whom &s;he had brought with her
from the Vallois, and who had been the
nur&s;e of her early childhood, and accom|panied
the Baron to the continent.
Having depo&s;ited the remains of the
Marquis according to his wi&s;h in the
tomb of his wife, and arranged their
affairs, they returned to Scotland, where
the fir&s;t intelligence they received on
their arrival at the ca&s;tle, was the death
of their &s;on, and of the old nur&s;e his at|tendant.
The &s;ervant had died &s;oon
after their departure; the child only a
fortnight before their return. This di&s;|a&s;trous
event affected equally the Baron
and his lady, who never cea&s;ed to con|demn
her&s;elf for having entru&s;ted her
&s;on to the care of &s;ervants. Time, how|ever,
&s;ubdued the poignancy of this
<PB N="149" REF="163">
affliction, but came fraught with another
yet more acute; this was the death of
the Baron, who in the pride of youth,
con&s;tituting the felicity of his family,
and of his people, was killed by a fall
from his hor&s;e, which he received in
hunting. He left the Barone&s;s and an
only daughter to bewail with uncea&s;ing
&s;orrow his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The paternal e&s;tates devolved of
cour&s;e to his only brother, the pre&s;ent
Baron, who&s;e character formed a mourn|ful
and &s;triking contra&s;t to that of the
decea&s;ed Lord. All his per&s;onal pro|perty,
which was con&s;iderable, with the
e&s;tates in Switzerland, he bequeathed to
his beloved wife and daughter. The
new Baron, immediately on the demi&s;e
of his brother, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
ca&s;tle, but allowed the Barone&s;s, with a
part of her &s;uit, to remain its inhabi|tant
till the expiration of the year. The
Barone&s;s ab&s;orbed in grief, &s;till loved to
<PB N="150" REF="164">
recall in the &s;cenes of her late felicity,
the image of her Lord, and to linger in
his former haunts. This motive, toge|ther
with the nece&s;&s;ity of preparation for
a journey to Switzerland, induced her to
accept the offer of the Baron.</P>
<P>The memory of his brother had
quickly faded from the mind of Mal|colm,
who&s;e attention appeared to be
wholly occupied by &s;chemes of ava|rice
and ambition. His arrogance;
and boundle&s;s love of power, em|broiled
him with the neighbouring
Chiefs, and engaged him in continual
ho&s;tility. He &s;eldom vi&s;ited the Ba|rone&s;s;
when he did, his manner was
cold, and even haughty. The Barone&s;s,
&s;hocked to receive &s;uch treatment from
the brother of her decea&s;ed Lord, and
reduced to feel her&s;elf an unwelcome
gue&s;t in that ca&s;tle which &s;he had been
accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as her own, de|termined
to &s;et off for the continent im|mediately,
<PB N="151" REF="165">
and &s;eek in the &s;olitudes of
her native mountains, an a&s;ylum from
the frown of in&s;ulting power. The con|tra&s;t
of character between the brothers
drew many a &s;igh of bitter recollection
from her heart, and added weight to the
&s;orrows which already oppre&s;&s;ed it. She
gave orders, therefore, to her dome&s;tics,
to prepare for immediate departure;
but was &s;oon after told that the Baron
had forbad them to obey the command.
A&s;toni&s;hed at this circum&s;tance, &s;he had
not time to demand an explanation, ere
a me&s;&s;age from Malcolm required a few
moments private conver&s;ation. The
me&s;&s;enger was followed almo&s;t in&s;tantly
by the Baron, who entered the apart|ment
with hurried &s;teps, his counte|nance
over&s;pread with the dark purpo&s;es
of his &s;oul. "I come, Madam," &s;aid
he, in a voice &s;tern and determined,
"to inform you, that you quit not this
ca&s;tle. The e&s;tates which you call yours,
are mine; and think not that I &s;hall
<PB N="152" REF="166">
neglect to pro&s;ecute my claim. The
frequent and ill-timed genero&s;ities of
my brother, have dimini&s;hed the value
of tho&s;e lands which are mine by inhe|ritance;
and I have, therefore, an indi&s;|pen&s;able
right to re-pay my&s;elf from
tho&s;e e&s;tates which he acquired with
you. In point of ju&s;tice, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
not the right of devi&s;ing the&s;e e&s;tates,
and I &s;hall not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be de|ceived
by the eva&s;ions of the law; re|&s;ign,
therefore, the will, which remains
only a record of unju&s;t withes, and inef|fectual
claims. When the receipts from
your e&s;tates have &s;atisfied my demands,
they &s;hall again be yours. The apart|ments
you now inhabit &s;hall remain your
own; but beyond the wall of this ca&s;tle
you &s;hall not pa&s;s; for I &s;hall not, by
&s;uffering your departure, afford you an
opportunity of conte&s;ting tho&s;e rights
which I can enforce without oppo|&s;ition."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="167">
Overcome with a&s;toni&s;hment and
dread, the Barone&s;s was for &s;ome time
deprived of all power of reply. At
length, rou&s;ed by the &s;pirit of indigna|tion;
"I am too well informed, my
Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "of my ju&s;t claims to
the lands in que&s;tion; and know al&s;o
too well the value of that integrity
which is now no more, to credit your
bold a&s;&s;ertions; they &s;erve only to un|veil
to me the darkne&s;s of a character,
cruel and rapacious; who&s;e boundle&s;s
avarice trampling on the barriers of ju&s;|tice
and humanity, &s;eizes on the right
of the defencele&s;s widow, and on the
portion of the unre&s;i&s;ting orphan. This,
my Lord, you are permitted to do;
they have no means of re&s;i&s;tance; but
think not to impo&s;e on me by a &s;ophi&s;ti|cal
a&s;&s;ertion of right, or to glo&s;s the vil|lainy
of your conduct with the colours
of ju&s;tice; the artifice is beneath the
de&s;perate force of your character, and is
not &s;ufficiently &s;pecious to deceive the
<PB N="154" REF="168">
di&s;cernment of virtue. From being
your pri&s;oner I have no means of e&s;cap|ing;
but never, my Lord, will I re&s;ign
into your hands that will which is the
efficient bond of my rights, and the la&s;t
&s;ad record of the affection of my de|parted
Lord." Grief clo&s;ed her lips.
The Baron denouncing vengeance on
her re&s;i&s;tance, his features inflamed with
rage, quitted the apartment. The Ba|rone&s;s
was left to lament with deepning
angui&s;h, the &s;troke which had deprived
her of a beloved hu&s;band; and reflection
gave her the wretchedne&s;s of her &s;itua|ation
in yet more lively colours. She
was now a &s;tranger in a foreign land,
deprived by him of whom &s;he had a
right to demand protection, of all her
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; a pri&s;oner in his ca&s;tle,
without one friend to vindicate her
cau&s;e, and far remote from any means
of appeal to the laws of the country.
She wept over the youthful Laura, and
while the pre&s;&s;ed her with mournful
<PB N="155" REF="169">
fondne&s;s to her bo&s;om, &s;he was con|firmed
in her re&s;olve never to relinquish
that will, by which alone the rights of
her injured child could ever be a&s;cer|tained.</P>
<P>The Baron, bold in iniquity, obtained
by forged powers, the revenues of the
foreign e&s;tates; and by this means, ef|fectually
kept the Barone&s;s in his power,
and deprived her of her la&s;t re&s;ource.
Secure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates,
and of the Barone&s;s, he no longer re|garded
the will as an object of import|ance;
and as &s;he did not attempt any
means of e&s;cape, or the recovery of her
rights, he &s;uffered her to remain un|di&s;turbed,
and in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
will.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s now pa&s;&s;ed her days in
unvaried &s;orrow, except in tho&s;e inter|vals
when &s;he forced her mind from its
melancholy &s;ubject, and devoted her&s;elf
<PB N="156" REF="170">
to the education of her daughter. The
artle&s;s efforts of Laura, to a&s;&s;uage the
&s;orrows of her mother, only fixed them
in her heart in deeper impre&s;&s;ion, &s;ince
they gave to her mind in &s;tronger tints,
the cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion to which her
tender years were condemned. The
progre&s;s which &s;he made in mu&s;ic and
drawing, and in the lighter &s;ubjects of
literature, while it plea&s;ed the Barone&s;s,
who was her &s;ole in&s;tructre&s;s, brought
with it the bitter apprehen&s;ion, that
the&s;e accompli&s;hments would probably
be buried in the ob&s;curity of a pri&s;on;
&s;till however, they were not u&s;ele&s;s,
&s;ince they &s;erved at pre&s;ent to cheat af|fliction
of many a weary moment, and
would in future delude the melancholy
hours of &s;olitude. Laura was particu|larly
fond of the lute, which &s;he touched
with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and who&s;e ten|der
notes were &s;o &s;weetly in uni&s;on with
the chords of &s;orrow, and with tho&s;e
plaintive tones with which &s;he loved to
<PB N="157" REF="171">
accompany it. While &s;he &s;ung, the
Barone&s;s would &s;it ab&s;orbed in recollec|tion,
the tears fa&s;t falling from her eyes,
and &s;he might be &s;aid to ta&s;te in tho&s;e
moments the luxury of woe.</P>
<P>Malcolm, &s;tung with a &s;en&s;e of guilt,
avoided the pre&s;ence of his injured cap|tive,
and &s;ought an a&s;ylum from con|&s;cience
in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of war.</P>
<P>Eighteen years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince
the death of the Baron, and the confine|ment
of Loui&s;a. Time had blunted the
point of affliction, though it &s;till re|tained
its venom; but &s;he &s;eldom dared
to hope for that which for eighteen years
had been with-held. She derived her
only con&s;olation from the improvement
and the tender &s;ympathy of her daugh|ter,
who endeavoured by every &s;oothing
attention to alleviate the &s;orrows of her
parent.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="172">
It was at this period that the Barone&s;s
communicated to the Earl the &s;tory of
her calamities.</P>
<P>The Earl li&s;tened with deep attention
to the recital. His &s;oul burned with
indignation again&s;t the Baron, while
his heart gave to the &s;ufferings of the
fair mourners, all that &s;ympathy could
a&s;k. Yet he was relieved from a very
painful &s;en&s;ation, when he learned that
the beauty of Laura had not influenced
the conduct of the Baron. Her op|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;ituation &s;truck upon his heart
the fine&s;t touch of pity; and the pa&s;&s;ion
which her beauty and her &s;implicity
had in&s;pired, was &s;trengthened and me|liorated
by her misfortunes. The fate
of his father, and the idea of his own
injuries, ru&s;hed upon his mind; and,
combining with the &s;ufferings of the
victims now before him, rou&s;ed in his
&s;oul a &s;torm of indignation, little inferior
<PB N="159" REF="173">
to that he had &s;uffered in his fir&s;t inter|view
with the Baron. Every con&s;ider|ation
&s;unk before the impul&s;e of a ju&s;t
revenge; his mind, occupied with the
hateful image of the murderer alone,
was hardened again&s;t danger, and in
the fir&s;t energies of his re&s;entment he
would have ru&s;hed to the apartment
of Malcolm, and &s;triking the &s;word of
ju&s;tice in his heart, have delivered the
earth from a mon&s;ter, and have re&s;igned
him&s;elf the willing &s;acrifice of the ac|tion.
"Shall the mon&s;ter live?" cried
he, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat. His &s;tep was
hurried, and his countenance was
&s;tamped with a &s;tern virtue. The Ba|rone&s;s
was alarmed, and following him
to the door of her apartment, which
he had half opened, conjured him to
pau&s;e for a moment on the dangers
that &s;urrounded him. The voice of
rea&s;on in the accents of the Barone&s;s,
interrupted the hurried tumult of his
<PB N="160" REF="174">
&s;oul; the illu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion di&s;ap|peared;
he recollected that he was ig|norant
of the apartment of the Baron,
and that he had no weapon to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
purpo&s;e; and he found him&s;elf as a
traveller on enchanted ground, when
the wand of the magician &s;uddenly
di&s;&s;olves the airy &s;cene, and leaves him
environed with the horrors of &s;olitude
and of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Earl returned to his &s;eat hopele&s;s
and dejected, and lo&s;t to every thing but
to the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointment. He
forgot where he was, and the latene&s;s of
the hour, till reminded by the Barone&s;s
of the dangers of a longer &s;tay, when he
mournfully bad her good night; and
advancing to Laura with timid re&s;pect,
pre&s;&s;ed her hand tenderly to his lips, and
retired to his pri&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>HE had now opened the partition,
and was entering the room, when
by the faint gleam which the fire threw
acro&s;s the apartment, he perceived indi&s;|tinctly
the figure of a man, and in the
&s;ame in&s;tant heard the &s;ound of ap|proaching
armour. Surprize and horror
thrilled through every nerve; he re|mained
fixed to the &s;pot, and for &s;ome
moments he&s;itated whether to retire. A
fearful &s;ilence en&s;ued; the per&s;on whom
he thought he had &s;een, di&s;appeared in
the darkne&s;s of the room; the noi&s;e of
armour was heard no more; and he
began to think that the figure he had
&s;een, and the &s;ound he had heard, were
the phantoms of a &s;ick imagination,
which the agitation of his &s;pirits, the
&s;olemnity of the hour, and the wide de|solation
of the place had conjured up.
<PB N="162" REF="176">
The low &s;ounds of an unknown voice
now &s;tarted upon his ear; it &s;eemed to
be almo&s;t clo&s;e be&s;ide him; he &s;prung
onward, and his hand gra&s;ped the &s;teely
coldne&s;s of armour, while the arm it
enclo&s;ed &s;truggled to get free. "Speak!
what wretch art thou?" cried O&s;bert,
when a &s;udden blaze of light from the
fire di&s;covered to him a &s;oldier of the
Baron. His agitation for &s;ome time
prevented his ob&s;erving that there was
more of alarm than of de&s;ign expre&s;&s;ed
in the countenance of the man; but the
apprehen&s;ion of the Earl was quickly
lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment, when he beheld
the guard at his feet. It was Edmund
who had entered the pri&s;on under pre|tence
of carrying fuel to the fire, but
&s;ecretly for the purpo&s;e of conferring
with O&s;bert. When the Earl under|&s;tood
he came from Alleyn, his bo&s;om
glowed with gratitude towards the ge|nerous
youth, who&s;e &s;teady and active
zeal had never relaxed &s;ince the hour in
<PB N="163" REF="177">
which he fir&s;t engaged in his cau&s;e.
The tran&s;port of his heart may be ea&s;ily
imagined, when he learned the &s;chemes
that were planning for his deliverance.
The circum&s;tance which had nearly de|feated
the warm hopes of his friends,
was by him di&s;regarded, &s;ince the
knowledge of the &s;ecret door opened to
him, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a guide
through the intricacies of the ca&s;tle, a
certain means of e&s;cape. Edmund was
well acquainted with all the&s;e. The
Earl told him of the di&s;covery of
the fal&s;e pannel; bade him return
to Alleyn with the joyful intelligence,
and on his next night of watch
prepare to aid him in e&s;cape. Ed|mund
knew well the apartments which
O&s;bert de&s;cribed, and the great &s;tair|ca&s;e
which led into a part of the ca&s;tle
that had long been totally for&s;aken, and
from whence it was ea&s;y to pa&s;s unob|&s;erved
into the vaults which communi|cated
<PB N="164" REF="178">
with the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages in
the rock.</P>
<P>Alleyn heard the report of James with
a warm and generous joy, which impelled
him to ha&s;ten immediately to the ca&s;tle of
Athlin, and di&s;pel the &s;orrows that in|habited
there; but the con&s;ideration
that his &s;udden ab&s;ence from the camp
might create &s;u&s;picion, and invite dis|covery,
checked the impul&s;e; and he
yielded with reluctance to the nece&s;&s;ity
which condemned the Counte&s;s and
Mary to the horrors of a lengthened
&s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, meanwhile, who&s;e de|&s;igns,
&s;trengthened by the &s;teady deter|mination
of Mary, were un&s;haken by the
me&s;&s;age of the Earl, which &s;he con&s;idered
as only the effect of a momentary im|pul&s;e,
watched the gradual departure of
tho&s;e days which led to that which enve|loped
the fate of her children, with ago|ny
<PB N="165" REF="179">
and fainting hope. She received no
news from the camp; no words of com|fort
from Alleyn; and &s;he &s;aw the confi|dence
which had nouri&s;hed her exi&s;tence
&s;lowly &s;inking in de&s;pair. Mary &s;ought
to administer that comfort to the afflic|tions
of her mother, which her own
equally demanded; &s;he &s;trove by the
fortitude with which &s;he endeavoured to
re&s;ign her&s;elf, to &s;often the a&s;perity of
the &s;ufferings which threatened the
Counte&s;s; and &s;he contemplated the
approaching &s;torm with the determined
coolne&s;s of a mind a&s;piring to virtue as
the chief good. But &s;he &s;edulou&s;ly
&s;ought to exclude Alleyn from her
mind; his di&s;intere&s;ted and noble con|duct
excited emotions dangerous to her
fortitude, and which rendered yet more
poignant the tortures of the approaching
&s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Anxious to inform the Barone&s;s of
his approaching deliverance, to a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="166" REF="180">
her of his be&s;t &s;ervices, to bid adieu to
Laura, and to &s;eize the la&s;t opportunity
he might ever po&s;&s;e&s;s of di&s;clo&s;ing to her
his admiration and his love, die Earl re|vi&s;ited
the apartments of the Barone&s;s.
She felt a lively plea&s;ure on the pro&s;pect
of his e&s;cape; and Laura, in the joy
which animated her on hearing this in|telligence,
forgot the &s;orrows of her own
&s;ituation; forgot that of which her heart
&s;oon reminded her&mdash;that O&s;bert was
leaving the place of her confinement,
and that she &s;hould probably &s;ee him no
more. This thought ca&s;t a &s;udden
&s;hade over her features, and from the
enlivening expre&s;&s;ion of joy, they re|&s;umed
their wonted melancholy. O&s;bert
marked the momentary change, and his
heart &s;poke to him the occa&s;ion. "My
cup of joy is dashed with bitterne&s;s,"
said he, "for amid the happine&s;s of ap|proaching
deliverance, I quit not my
pri&s;on without &s;ome pangs of keen re|gret;&mdash;pangs
which it were probably
<PB N="167" REF="181">
u&s;ele&s;s to make known, yet which my
feelings will not &s;uffer me at this mo|ment
to conceal. Within the&s;e walls,
from whence I fly with eagerne&s;s, I
leave a heart fraught with the mo&s;t ten|der
pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;a heart, which while it
beats with life, mu&s;t ever unite the
image of Laura with the fondne&s;s of
love. Could I hope that &s;he were not
in&s;en&s;ible to my attachment I &s;hould de|part
in peace, and would defy the ob&s;ta|cles
which bid me de&s;pair. Were I
even certain that &s;he would repel my
love with cold indifference, I would
yet if &s;he accept my &s;ervices, effect her
re&s;cue or give my life the forfeiture."
Laura was &s;ilent; &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak
her gratitude, yet feared to tell her love;
but the &s;oft timidity of her eye, and the
tender glow of her cheek, revealed the
&s;ecret that trembled on her lips. The
Barone&s;s ob&s;erved her confu&s;ion, and
thanking the Earl for the noble &s;ervice
he offered, declined accepting it; &s;he
<PB N="168" REF="182">
be&s;ought him to involve no further the
peace of his family and of him&s;elf, by
attempting an enterprize &s;o crowded
with dangers, and which might proba|bly
co&s;t him his life. The arguments
of the Barone&s;s fell forcele&s;s when op|po&s;ed
to the feelings of the Earl; &s;o
warmly he urged his &s;uit, and dwelt &s;o
forcibly on his approaching departure,
that the Barone&s;s cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e, and
the &s;ilence of Laura yielded acqui|e&s;cence.
After a tender farewell, with
many earne&s;t wi&s;hes for his &s;afety, the
Earl quitted the apartment elated with
hope. But the Baron had been in|formed
of his projected e&s;cape, and had
&s;tudied the means of counteracting it.
The centinel had communicated his
di&s;covery to &s;ome of his comrades, who
without virtue or courage &s;ufficient to
quit the &s;ervice of the Baron, were de|&s;irous
of obtaining his favour, and failed
not to &s;eize on an opportunity &s;o flat|tering
as the pre&s;ent, to accomplish
<PB N="169" REF="183">
their purpo&s;e. They communicated to
their Chief the intelligence they had
received.</P>
<P>Malcolm, careful to conceal his know|ledge
of the &s;cheme, from a de&s;ign to
entrap tho&s;e of the clan who were to
meet the Earl, had &s;uffered Edmund to
return to his &s;tation at the pri&s;on, where
he had placed the informers as &s;ecret
guards, and had taken &s;uch other pre|cautions
as were nece&s;&s;ary to intercept
their flight, &s;hould they elude the vigi|lance
of the &s;oldiers, and likewi&s;e to &s;e|cure
tho&s;e of his people who &s;hould be
drawn toward the ca&s;tle in expectation of
their Chief. Having done this, he
prided him&s;elf in &s;ecurity, and in the
certainty of exulting over his enemies,
thus entangled in their own &s;tratagem.</P>
<P>After many weary moments of impa|tience
to Alleyn, and of expectation to
the Earl, the night at length arrived on
<PB N="170" REF="184">
which hung the event of all their hopes.
It was agreed that Alleyn, with a cho&s;en
few, &s;hould await the arrival of the
Earl in the cavern where terminated
the &s;ubterraneous avenue. Alleyn parted
from James with extreme agitation, and
returned to his tent to compo&s;e his
mind.</P>
<P>It was now the dead of night; pro|found
&s;leep reigned through the ca&s;tle
of Dunbayne, when Edmund gently
unbolted the pri&s;on door, and hailed the
Earl. He &s;prung forward, and in&s;tantly
unclo&s;ed the pannel, which they fa&s;|tened
after them to prevent di&s;covery,
and pa&s;&s;ing with fearful &s;teps the cold
and &s;ilent apartments, de&s;cended the
great &s;tair-ca&s;e into the hall, who&s;e
wide and dark de&s;olation was rendered
vi&s;ible only by the dim light of the
taper which Edmund carried in his
hand, and who&s;e vaulted ceiling re|echoed
their &s;teps. After various wind|ings
<PB N="171" REF="185">
they de&s;cended into the vaults; in
pa&s;&s;ing their dreary length they often
pau&s;ed in fearful &s;ilence, li&s;tening to the
hollow bla&s;ts which bur&s;t &s;uddenly
through the pa&s;&s;ages, and which &s;eemed
to bear in the &s;ound the foot&s;teps of
pur&s;uit. At length they reached the
extremity of the vaults, where Edmund
&s;earched for a trap-door which lay al|most
concealed in the dirt and darkne&s;s;
after &s;ome time they found, and with
difficulty rai&s;ed it, for it was long &s;ince
it had been opened; and it was be&s;ides
heavy with iron work. They entered,
and letting the door fall after them,
de&s;cended a narrow &s;light of &s;teps
which conducted them to a winding
pa&s;&s;age clo&s;ed by a door that opened in|to
the main avenue whence Alleyn had
before made his e&s;cape. Having gained
this, they &s;tepped on with confidence,
for they were now not far from the ca|vern
where Alleyn and his companions
were awaiting their arrival. The heart
<PB N="172" REF="186">
of Alleyn now &s;welled with joy, for he
perceived a gleam of di&s;tant light break
upon the walls of the avenue, and at the
&s;ame time thought he heard the faint
&s;ound of approaching foot&s;teps. Im|patient
to throw him&s;elf at the feet of
the Earl, he entered the avenue. The
light grew &s;tronger upon the walls; but
a point of rock who&s;e projection cau&s;ed
a winding in the pa&s;&s;age, concealed from
his view the per&s;on his eyes &s;o eagerly
&s;ought. The &s;ound of &s;teps was now
fa&s;t approaching, and Alleyn gaining
the rock, &s;uddenly turned upon three
&s;oldiers of the Baron. They in&s;tantly
&s;eized him their pri&s;oner. A&s;toni&s;h|ment
for a while overcome every other
&s;en&s;ation; but as they led him along, the
horrid rever&s;e of the moment &s;truck
upon his heart with all its con&s;equences,
and he had no doubt that the Earl had
been &s;eized and carried back to his pri|&s;on.
As he marched along ab&s;orbed in
this reflection, a light appeared at
<PB N="173" REF="187">
&s;ome di&s;tance, from a door that opened
upon the avenue, and di&s;covered the
figures of two men, who on perceiving
the party, retreated with precipitation,
and clo&s;ed the door after them. Alleyn
knew the Earl in the per&s;on of one of
them. Two of the &s;oldiers quitting
Alleyn, pur&s;ued the fugitives, and
quickly di&s;appeared through a door.
Alleyn finding him&s;elf alone with the
guard, &s;eized the moment of opportu|nity,
and made a de&s;perate effort to re|gain
his &s;word. He &s;ucceeded; and in
the &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack, obtained
al&s;o the weapon of his adver&s;ary, who,
unarmed, fell at his feet, and called for
mercy. Alleyn gave him his life. The
&s;oldier, grateful for the gift, and fearful
of the Baron's vengeance, de&s;ired to fly
with him, and enli&s;t in his &s;ervice.
They quitted the &s;ubterraneous way to|gether.
On entering the cavern, Alleyn
found it vacated by his friends, who on
hearing the cla&s;h of armour, and the
<PB N="174" REF="188">
loud and menacing voices of the &s;ol|diers,
under&s;tood his fate, and appre|hen&s;ive
of numbers, had fled to avoid a
&s;imilar di&s;a&s;ter. Alleyn returned to his
tent, &s;hocked with di&s;appointment, and
lo&s;t in de&s;pair. Every effort which he
had made for the deliverance of the
Earl, had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful; and this
&s;cheme, on which was &s;u&s;pended his
la&s;t hope, had been defeated at the very
moment in which he exulted in its com|pletion.
He threw him&s;elf on the
ground, and lo&s;t in bitter thought, ob|&s;erved
not the curtain of his tent un|draw,
till recalled by a &s;udden noi&s;e, he
looked up, and beheld the Earl. Ter|ror
fixed him to the &s;pot, and for a mo|ment
he involuntarily acknowledged the
traditionary vi&s;ions of his nation. The
well-known voice of O&s;bert, however,
awakened him to truth, and the ardor
with which he embraced his knees,
immediately convinced him that he
cla&s;ped reality.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="189">
The &s;oldiers, in the eagerne&s;s of pur|&s;uit,
had mi&s;taken the door by which
O&s;bert had retired, and had entered one
below it, which after engaging them in
a fruitle&s;s &s;earch through various intri|cate
pa&s;&s;ages, had conducted them to a
remote part of the ca&s;tle, from whence
after much perplexity and lo&s;s of time,
they were at length extricated. The
Earl, who had retreated on &s;ight of the
&s;oldiers, had fled in the mean time to
regain the trap-door; but the united
&s;trength of him&s;elf and of Edmund was
in vain exerted to open it. Compelled
to encounter the approaching evil, the
Earl took the &s;word of his companion,
re&s;olving to meet the approach of his
adver&s;aries, and to effect his deliver|ance
or yield his life and his misfor|tunes
to the attempt. With this de&s;ign
he advanced deliberately along the pa&s;|&s;age,
and arriving at the door, &s;topped
to di&s;cover the motions of his pur&s;uers:
all was profoundly &s;ilent. After re|maining
<PB N="176" REF="190">
&s;ome time in this &s;ituation, he
opened the door, and examining the
avenue with a firm yet anxious eye as
far as the light of his taper threw its
beams, di&s;covered no human being.
He proceeded with cautious firmne&s;s
towards the cavern, every in&s;tant ex|pecting
the &s;oldiers to &s;tart &s;uddenly
upon him from &s;ome dark rece&s;s.&mdash;With
a&s;toni&s;hment he reached the cave
without interruption; and unable to ac|count
for his unexpected deliverance,
ha&s;tened with Edmund to join his faith|ful
people.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers who watched the pri&s;on,
being ignorant of any other way by
which the Earl could e&s;cape, than the
door which they guarded, had &s;uffered
Edmund to enter the apartment without
fear. It was &s;ome time before they
di&s;covered their error; &s;urprized at the
length of his &s;tay, they opened the door
of the pri&s;on, which to their utter a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
<PB N="177" REF="191">
they found empty. The
grates were examined; they remained
as u&s;ual; every corner was explored;
but the fal&s;e pannel remained unknown;
and having fini&s;hed their examination
without di&s;covering any vi&s;ible means
by which the Earl had quitted the pri|&s;on,
they were &s;eized with terror, con|cluding
it to be the work of a &s;uper|natural
power, and immediately alarmed
the ca&s;tle. The Baron, rou&s;ed by the
tumult, was informed of the fact, and
dubious of the integrity of his guards,
a&s;cended to the apartment; which hav|ing
him&s;elf examined without di&s;cover|ing
any means of e&s;cape, he no longer
he&s;itated to pronounce the centinels ac|ce&s;&s;ary
to the Earl's enlargement. The
unfeigned terror which they exhibited
was mi&s;taken for artifice, and their
&s;uppo&s;ed treachery was admitted and
puni&s;hed in the &s;ame moment. They
were thrown into the dungeon of the
ca&s;tle. Soldiers were immediately di&s;|patched
in pur&s;uit, but the time
<PB N="178" REF="192">
which had elap&s;ed ere the guards had
entered the pri&s;on, had given the Earl
an opportunity of e&s;cape. When the
certainty of this was communicated to
the Baron, every pa&s;&s;ion who&s;e &s;ingle
force is mi&s;ery, united in his brea&s;t to
torture him; and his brain exa&s;perated
almo&s;t to madne&s;s, gave him only dire|ful
images of revenge.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s and Laura awakened by
the tumult, had been filled with appre|hen&s;ion
for the Earl, till they were in|formed
of the cau&s;e of the general con|fu&s;ion;
and hope and dubious joy were
ere long confirmed into certainty, for
they were told of the fruitle&s;s &s;earch of
the pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>It was now the la&s;t day of the term
in which the Counte&s;s had &s;tipulated to
return her an&s;wer; &s;he had yet heard
nothing from Alleyn; for Alleyn had
been bu&s;ied in &s;chemes, of the event of
<PB N="179" REF="193">
which he could &s;end no account, for
their &s;ucce&s;s had been yet undetermined.
Every hope of the Earl's deliverance was
now expired, and in the angui&s;h of her
heart, the Counte&s;s prepared to give that
an&s;wer which would &s;end the devoted
Mary to the arms of the murderer.</P>
<P>Mary, who a&s;&s;umed a fortitude not her
own, &s;trove to abate the rigor of her
mother's &s;ufferings, but vainly &s;trove;
they were of a nature which defied con|&s;olation.
She wrote the fatal agree|ment,
but delayed till the la&s;t moment
delivering it into the hands of the me&s;|&s;enger.
It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that
the Baron &s;hould receive it on the fol|lowing
morn, le&s;t the impatience of re|venge
&s;hould urge him to &s;eize on the
life of the Earl as the forfeiture of delay.
She &s;ent, therefore, for the me&s;&s;enger,
who was a veteran of the clan, and with
extreme agitation delivered to him her
an&s;wer; grief interrupted her voice; &s;he
was unable to &s;peak to him; and he was
<PB N="180" REF="194">
awaiting her orders, when the door of
the apartment was thrown open, and
the Earl, followed by Alleyn, threw
him&s;elf at her feet. A faint &s;cream was
uttered by the Counte&s;s, and &s;he &s;unk,
in her chair. Mary not daring to tru&s;t
her&s;elf with the delightful vi&s;ion, endea|voured
to re&s;train the tide of joy which
hurried to her heart, and threatened to
overwhelm her.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Athlin refounded with
tumultuous joy on this happy event;
the courts were filled with tho&s;e of the
clan who had been di&s;abled from attend|ing
the field, and whom the report of
the Earl's return, which had circulated
with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, had brought
thither. The hall re-echoed with voices;
and the people could &s;carcely be re|&s;trained
from ru&s;hing into the pre&s;ence
of their Chief, to congratulate him on
his e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="195">
When the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of the meet|ing
were &s;ub&s;ided, the Earl pre&s;ented
Alleyn to his family as his friend and
deliverer; who&s;e &s;teady attachment he
could never forget, and who&s;e zealous
&s;ervices he could never repay. The
cheek of Mary glowed with plea&s;ure and
gratitude at this tribute to the worth
of Alleyn; and the &s;miling approation of
her eyes rewarded him for his noble
deeds. The Counte&s;s received him
as the deliverer of both her children,
and related to O&s;bert the adventure
in the wood. The Earl embraced
Alleyn, who received the united ac|knowledgements
of the family with
unaffected mode&s;ty. O&s;bert he&s;itated
not to pronounce the Baron the author
of the plot; his heart &s;welled to avenge
the repeated injuries of his family, and
he &s;ecretly re&s;olved to challenge his
enemy to &s;ingle combat. To renew the
&s;iege he con&s;idered as a vain project;
and this challenge, though a very ina|dequate
mode of revenge, was the only
<PB N="182" REF="196">
honourable one that remained for him.
He forbore to mention his de&s;ign to the
Counte&s;s, well knowing that her tender|ne&s;s
would oppo&s;e the mea&s;ure, and
throw difficulties in his way which
would embara&s;s, without preventing
his purpo&s;e. He mentioned the mis|fortunes
of the Barone&s;s, and the love|line&s;s
of her daughter, and excited the
e&s;teem and the commi&s;&s;eration of his
hearers.</P>
<P>The clamours of the people to be|hold
their Lord, now aro&s;e to the
apartment of the Counte&s;s, and he de|&s;cended
into the hall, accompanied by
Alleyn, to gratify their zeal. An uni|ver&s;al
&s;hout of joy re&s;ounded through
the walls on his appearance. A noble
plea&s;ure glowed on the countenance
of the Earl at &s;ight of his faithful peo|ple;
and in the delight of that moment
his heart bore te&s;timony to the &s;uperior
advantages of an equitable government.
<PB N="183" REF="197">
The Earl impatient to te&s;tify his grati|tude,
introduced Alleyn to the clan as
his friend and deliverer, and immedi|ately
pre&s;ented his father with a lot of
land, where he might end his days in
peace and plenty. Old Alleyn thanked
the Earl for his offered kindne&s;s, but
declined accepting it; alledging, that
he was attached to his old cottage, and
that he had already &s;ufficient for the
comforts of his age.</P>
<P>On the following morning a me&s;&s;en|ger
was privately di&s;patched to the Ba|ron,
with the challenge of the Earl.
The challenge was couched in terms of
haughty indignation, and expre&s;&s;ed that
nothing but the failure of all other
means could have urged him to the
conde&s;cen&s;ion of meeting the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of
his father, on terms of equal combat.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s was once more re&s;tored to
Athlin. The Counte&s;s, in the unex|pected
<PB N="184" REF="198">
pre&s;ervation of her children,
&s;eemed to be alive only to joy. The
Earl was now for a time &s;ecure in the
bo&s;om of his family, and though his
impatience to avenge the injuries of
tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to him, and to &s;natch
from the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, the fair
&s;ufferers at Dunbayne, would not allow
him to be tranquil, yet he a&s;&s;umed a
gaiety unknown to his heart, and the
days were &s;pent in fe&s;tivals and joy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>IT was at this period, that one &s;tormy
evening, the Counte&s;s was &s;itting
with her family in a room, the windows
of which looked upon the &s;ea. The
winds bur&s;t in &s;udden &s;qualls over the
deep, and da&s;hed the foaming waves
again&s;t the rocks with inconceivable
fury. The &s;pray, notwithstanding the
high &s;ituation of the ca&s;tle, flew up with
violence again&s;t the windows. The
Earl went out upon the terrace beneath
to contemplate the &s;torm. The moon
&s;hone faintly by intervals, through bro|ken
clouds upon the waters, illumining
the white foam which bur&s;t around, and
enlightening the &s;cene &s;ufficiently to ren|der
it vi&s;ible. The &s;urges broke on the
di&s;tant &s;hores in deep re&s;ounding mur|murs,
and the &s;olemn pau&s;es between
the &s;tormy gu&s;ts filled the mind with
<PB N="186" REF="200">
enthu&s;ia&s;tic awe. As the Earl &s;tood
wrapt in the &s;ublimity of the &s;cene, the
moon &s;uddenly emerging from a heavy
cloud, &s;hewed him at &s;ome di&s;tance, a
ve&s;&s;el driven by the fury of the bla&s;t to|wards
the coa&s;t. He pre&s;ently heard
the &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; and &s;oon after
&s;hrieks of terror, and a confu&s;ed uproar
of voices were borne on the wind. He
ha&s;tened from the terrace to order his
people to go out with boats to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of the crew, for he doubted not
that the ve&s;&s;el was wrecked; but the &s;ea
ran &s;o high as to make the adventure
impracticable. The &s;ound of voices
cea&s;ed, and he concluded the wretched
mariners were lo&s;t, when the &s;creams of
di&s;tre&s;s again &s;truck his ear, and again
were lo&s;t in the tumult of the &s;torm; in
a moment after the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck upon
the rock beneath the ca&s;tle; an univer|&s;al
&s;hriek en&s;ued. The Earl, with his
people, ha&s;tened to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
crew; the fury of the gu&s;t was now
<PB N="187" REF="201">
abated, and the Earl jumping into a
boat with Alleyn and &s;ome others, rowed
to the &s;hip, where they re&s;cued a part
of the drowning people. They were
conducted to the ca&s;tle, and every com|fort
was liberally admini&s;tered to them.
Among tho&s;e whom the Earl had re|ceived
into his boat, was a &s;tranger,
who&s;e dignified a&s;pect and manners be|&s;poke
him to be of rank; he had &s;eve|ral
people belonging to him, but they
were foreigners, and ignorant of the
language of the country. He thanked
his deliverer with a noble frankne&s;s that
charmed him. In the hall they were
met by the Counte&s;s and her daughter,
who received the &s;tranger with the warm
welcome which compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;itu|ation
had in&s;pired. He was conducted
to the &s;upper room, where the magnifi|cence
of the board exhibited only the
u&s;ual ho&s;pitality of his ho&s;t. The &s;tran|ger
&s;poke Engli&s;h fluently, and di&s;|played
in his conver&s;ation a manly and
<PB N="188" REF="202">
vigorous mind, acquainted with the
&s;ciences, and with life; and the ca&s;t of
his ob&s;ervations &s;eemed to characterize
the benevolence of his heart. The
Earl was &s;o much plea&s;ed with his gue&s;t,
that he pre&s;&s;ed him to remain at his
ca&s;tle till another ve&s;&s;el could be pro|cured;
his gue&s;t equally plea&s;ed with
the Earl, and a &s;tranger to the country,
accepted the invitation.</P>
<P>New di&s;tre&s;s now broke upon the
peace of Athlin; &s;everal days had ex|pired,
and the me&s;&s;enger who had been
&s;ent to Malcolm, did not appear. It
was almo&s;t evident that the Baron, di&s;|appointed
and enraged at the e&s;cape of
his pri&s;oner, and eager for a &s;acrifice,
had &s;eized this man as the &s;ubject of a
paltry revenge. The Earl, however,
re&s;olved to wait a few days, and watch
the event.</P>
<P>The &s;truggles of latent tenderne&s;s
<PB N="189" REF="203">
and a&s;&s;umed indifference, bani&s;hed tran|quillity
from the bo&s;om of Mary, and
pierced it with many &s;orrows. The
friendship and honours be&s;towed by the
Earl on Alleyn, who now re&s;ided &s;olely
at the ca&s;tle, touched her heart with a
&s;weet pride; but alas! the&s;e di&s;tincti|ons
&s;erved only to confirm her admira|tion
of that worth which had already
attached her affections, and afforded
him opportunities of exhibiting in
brighter colours the various excellen|cies
of a heart noble and expan&s;ive, and
of a mind who&s;e native elegance melio|rated
and adorned the bold vigour of its
flights. The langour of melancholy,
notwith&s;tanding the efforts of Mary,
would at intervals &s;teal from beneath the
di&s;gui&s;e of cheerfulne&s;s, and diffu&s;e over
her beautiful features an expre&s;&s;ion ex|tremely
interesting. The &s;tranger was
not in&s;en&s;ible to its charms, and it
&s;erved to heighten the admiration with
which he had fir&s;t beheld her into &s;ome|thing
<PB N="190" REF="204">
more tender and more powerful.
The mode&s;t dignity with which &s;he de|livered
her &s;entiments, which breathed
the pure&s;t delicacy and benevolence,
touched his heart, and he felt an intere&s;t
concerning her which he had never be|fore
experienced.</P>
<P>Alleyn, who&s;e heart amid the anxieties
and tumults of the pa&s;t &s;cenes, had &s;till
&s;ighed to the image of Mary;&mdash;that
image which fancy had pictured in all
the charms of the original, and who&s;e
glowing tints were yet softened and ren|dered
more intere&s;ting by the &s;hade of
melancholy with which ab&s;ence and
a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion had &s;urrounded
them, found amid the lei&s;ure of peace,
and the frequent opportunities which
were afforded him of beholding the ob|ject
of his attachment, his &s;ighs re|double,
and the glooms of &s;orrow thick|en.
In the pre&s;ence of Mary, a &s;oft
&s;adne&s;s clouded his brow; he endea|voured
<PB N="191" REF="205">
to a&s;&s;ume a cheerfulne&s;s foreign
to his heart; but endeavoured in vain.
Mary perceived the change in his
manners; and the ob&s;ervation did not
contribute to enliven her own. The
Earl, too, ob&s;erved that Alleyn had
lo&s;t much of his wonted &s;pirits, and
bantered him on the change, but thought
not of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Alleyn wi&s;hed to quit a place &s;o de|&s;tructive
to his peace as the ca&s;tle of
Athlin; he formed repeated re&s;olutions
of withdrawing him&s;elf from tho&s;e walls
which held him in a &s;ort of fa&s;cination,
and rendered ineffectual every half-formed
wi&s;h, and every weak endea|vour.
When he could no longer be|hold
Mary, he would frequently retire
to the terrace, which was overlooked by
the windows of her apartment, and
&s;pend half the night in traver&s;ing with
&s;ilent mournful &s;teps, that &s;pot which
afforded him the melancholy plea&s;ure
of being near the object of his love.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="206">
Matilda wi&s;hed to que&s;tion Alleyn
concerning &s;ome circum&s;tances of the
late events, and for this purpo&s;e or|dered
him one day to attend her in her
clo&s;et. As he pa&s;&s;ed the outer apart|ment
of the Counte&s;s, he perceived
&s;omething lying near the door through
which &s;he had before gone, and examin|ing
it, di&s;covered a bracelet, to which
was attached a miniature of Mary. His
heart beat quick at the &s;ight; the
temptation was too powerful to be re|&s;i&s;ted;
he concealed it in his bo&s;om, and
pa&s;&s;ed on. On quitting the clo&s;et, he
&s;ought with breathle&s;s impatience, a &s;pot
where he might contemplate at lei&s;ure
that precious portrait which chance had
&s;o kindly thrown in his way. He drew
it trembling from his bo&s;om, and beheld
again that countenance who&s;e &s;weet ex|pre&s;&s;ion
had touched his heart with all
the delightful agonies of love. As he
pre&s;&s;ed it with impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s
to his lips, the tear of rapture trembled
<PB N="193" REF="207">
in his eye, and the romantic ardor of the
moment was &s;carcely heightened by the
actual pre&s;ence of the beloved object,
who&s;e light &s;tep now &s;tole upon his ear,
and half turning, he beheld not the
picture, but the reality!&mdash;Surprized!&mdash;Confu&s;ed!&mdash;The
picture fell from
his hand. Mary, who had accidentally
&s;trolled to that &s;pot, on ob&s;erving the
agitation of Alleyn, was retiring, when
he, in who&s;e heart had been awakened
every tender &s;en&s;ation, lo&s;ing in the
temptation of the moment the fear of
di&s;dain, and forgetting the re&s;olution
which he had formed of eternal &s;ilence,
threw him&s;elf at her feet, and pre&s;&s;ed
her hand to his trembling lips. His
tongue would have told her that he
loved, but his emotion, and the repul|&s;ive
look of Mary, prevented him. She
in&s;tantly di&s;engaged her&s;elf with an air
of offended dignity, and ca&s;ting on him
a look of mingled anger and concern,
withdrew in &s;ilence. Alleyn remained
<PB N="194" REF="208">
fixed to the &s;pot; his eyes pur&s;uing her
retiring &s;teps, in&s;en&s;ible to every feeling
but love and de&s;pair. So ab&s;orbed was
he in the tran&s;ition of the moment, that
he almo&s;t doubted whether a vi&s;ionary
illu&s;ion had not cro&s;&s;ed his &s;ight to bla&s;t
his only remaining comfort&mdash;the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of de&s;erving, and of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
the e&s;teem of her he loved. He left
the place with angui&s;h in his heart,
and in the perturbation of his mind for|got
the picture.</P>
<P>Mary had ob&s;erved her mother's
bracelet fall from his hand, and was no
longer in perplexity concerning her mi|niature;
but in the confu&s;ion which his
behaviour occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ioned her, &s;he forgot to
demand it of him. The Counte&s;s had
mi&s;&s;ed it almo&s;t immediately after his
departure from the clo&s;et, and had
caused a &s;earch to be made, which
proving fruitle&s;s, her &s;u&s;picions wavered
upon him. The Earl, who &s;oon after
<PB N="195" REF="209">
pa&s;&s;ed the &s;pot whence Alleyn had ju&s;t
departed, found the miniature. It was
not long ere Alleyn recollected the
trea&s;ure he had dropped, and returned
in &s;earch of it. In&s;tead of the picture,
he found the Earl: a con&s;cious blu&s;h
cro&s;&s;ed his cheek; the confu&s;ion of his
countenance informed O&s;bert of a part
of the truth; who, anxious to know by
what means he had obtained it, pre|&s;ented
him the picture, and demanded
if he knew it. The &s;oul of Alleyn
knew not to di&s;&s;emble; he acknow|ledged
that he had found, and concealed
it; prompted by that pa&s;&s;ion, the con|fe&s;&s;ion
of which, no other circum&s;tance
than the pre&s;ent could have wrung from
his heart. The Earl li&s;tened to him
with a mixture of concern and pity;
but hereditary pride chilled the warm
feelings of friend&s;hip and of gratitude,
and extingui&s;hed the faint &s;park of hope
which the di&s;covery had kindled in the
bo&s;om of Alleyn. "Fear not, my
<PB N="196" REF="210">
Lord," &s;aid he, "the degradation of
your hou&s;e from one who would &s;acri|fice
his life in its defence; never more
&s;hall the pa&s;&s;ion which glows in my
heart e&s;cape from my lips. I will re|tire
from the &s;pot where I have buried
my tranquillity." "No," replied the
Earl, "you &s;hall remain here; I can
confide in your honour. O! that the
only reward which is adequate to your
worth and to your &s;ervices, &s;hould be
impo&s;&s;ible for me to be&s;tow." His
voice faultered, and he turned away to
conceal his emotion, with a &s;uffering
little inferior to that of Alleyn.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery which Mary had made,
did not contribute to re&s;tore peace to
her mind. Every circum&s;tance con|&s;pired
to a&s;&s;ure her of that ardent pa&s;&s;ion
which filled the bo&s;om of him whom all
her endeavours could not teach her to
forget; and this conviction &s;erved only
<PB N="197" REF="211">
to heighten her malady, and con&s;e|quently
her wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t which the &s;tranger di&s;|covered,
and the attention he paid to
Mary, had not pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved by
Alleyn. Love pointed to him the pas|&s;ion
which was ri&s;ing in his heart, and
whi&s;pered that the vows of his rival
would be propitious. The words of
O&s;bert confirmed him in the torturing
apprehen&s;ion; for though his humble
birth had never &s;uffered him to hope,
yet he thought he di&s;covered in the
&s;peech of the Earl, &s;omething more
than mere hereditary pride.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger had contemplated the
lovely form of Mary with increa&s;ing
admiration &s;ince the fir&s;t hour he
beheld her; this admiration was now
confirmed into love;&mdash;and he re|&s;olved
to acquaint the Earl with his
birth, and with his pa&s;&s;ion. For this
<PB N="198" REF="212">
purpo&s;e, he one morning drew him
a&s;ide to the terrace of the ca&s;tle, where
they could conver&s;e without interrup|tion;
and pointing to the ocean, over
which he had &s;o lately been borne,
thanked the Earl, who had thus &s;oftened
the horrors of &s;hipwreck, and the de&s;o|lation
of a foreign land, by the kind|ne&s;s
of his ho&s;pitality. He informed
him that he was a native of Switzer|land,
where he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed considerable
e&s;tates, from which he bore the title of
Count de Santmorin; that enquiry of
much moment to his intere&s;ts had
brought him to Scotland, to a neigh|bouring
port of which he was bound,
when the di&s;a&s;ter from which he had
been &s;o happily re&s;cued, arre&s;ted the
progre&s;s of his de&s;igns. He then related
to the Earl, that his voyage was under|taken
upon a report of the death of &s;ome
relations, at who&s;e demi&s;e con&s;iderable
e&s;tates in Switzerland became his inhe|ritance.
That the income of the&s;e e&s;tates
<PB N="199" REF="213">
had been hitherto received upon the
authority of powers, which, if the report
was true, were become invalid.</P>
<P>The Earl li&s;tened to this narrative in
&s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, and enquired with
much emotion, the name of the Count's
relations. "The Barone&s;s Malcolm,"
returned he. The Earl cla&s;ped his hands
in exta&s;y. The Count, &s;urprized at his
agitation, began to fear that the Earl
was di&s;agreeably interested in the welfare
of his adver&s;aries, and regretted that he
had di&s;clo&s;ed the affair, till he ob&s;erved
the plea&s;ure which was diffu&s;ed through
his features. O&s;bert explained the cau&s;e
of his emotion, by relating his know|ledge
of the Barone&s;s; in the progre&s;s
of who&s;e &s;tory, the character of Mal|colm
was &s;ufficiently elucidated. He
di&s;covered the cau&s;e of his hatred to|wards
the Baron, and the hi&s;tory of his
impri&s;onment; and al&s;o confided to his
honour the &s;ecret of his challenge.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="214">
The indignation of the Count was
&s;trongly excited; he was, however,
prevailed on by O&s;bert to forego any
immediate effort of revenge, awaiting
for a while the movements of Malcolm.</P>
<P>The Count was &s;o ab&s;orbed in won|der
and in new &s;en&s;ations, that he had
almo&s;t forgot the chief object of the in|terview.
Recollecting him&s;elf, he di&s;|covered
his pa&s;&s;ion, and reque&s;ted per|mi&s;&s;ion
of the Earl to throw him&s;elf at
the feet of Mary. The Earl li&s;tened to
the declaration with a mixture of plea|&s;ure
and concern; the remembrance of
Alleyn &s;addened his mind; but the wi&s;h
of an equal connection, made him wel|come
the offers of the Count, who&s;e alli|ance,
he told him, would do honour to
the fir&s;t nobility of his nation. If he
&s;ound the &s;entiments of his &s;i&s;ter in
&s;ympathy with his own on this point,
he would welcome him to his family
with the affection of a brother; but he
<PB N="201" REF="215">
wi&s;hed to di&s;cover the &s;ituation of her
heart, ere his noble friend di&s;clo&s;ed to
her his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Earl, on his return to the ca&s;tle,
enquired for Mary, whom he found in
the apartment of her mother. He
opened to them the hi&s;tory of the Count;
his relation&s;hip with the Barone&s;s Mal|colm,
with the object of his expedition;
and clo&s;ed the narrative with di&s;cover|ing
the attachment of his friend to
Mary, and his offers of alliance with his
family. Mary grew pale at this decla|ration;
there was a pang in her heart
which would not &s;uffer her to &s;peak;
&s;he threw her eyes on the ground, and
bur&s;t into tears. The Earl took her
hand tenderly in his; "my beloved
&s;i&s;ter," &s;aid he, "knows me too well to
doubt my affection, or to &s;uppo&s;e I can
wi&s;h to influence her upon a &s;ubject &s;o
material to her future happine&s;s, and
where her heart ought to be the princi|pal
<PB N="202" REF="216">
directre&s;s. Do me the ju&s;tice to be|lieve,
that I make known to you the
offers of the Count as a friend, not as a
director. He is a man, who from the
&s;hort period of our acquaintance, I have
judged to be de&s;erving of particular
e&s;teem. His mind appears to be noble;
his heart expan&s;ive; his rank is equal
with your own; and he loves you with
an attachment warm and &s;incere. But
with all the&s;e advantages, I would not
have my &s;i&s;ter give her&s;elf to the man
who does not meet an intere&s;t in her
heart to plead his cau&s;e."</P>
<P>The gentle &s;oul of Mary &s;welled with
gratitude towards her brother; &s;he
would have thanked him for the ten|derne&s;s
of the&s;e &s;entiments, but a variety
of emotions were &s;truggling at her
heart, and &s;topped her utterance; tears,
and a &s;mile &s;oftly clouded with &s;orrow,
were all &s;he could give him in reply.
He could not but perceive that &s;ome &s;e|cret
<PB N="203" REF="217">
cau&s;e of grief preyed upon her
mind, and he &s;olicited to know, and to
remove it. "My dear brother will
believe the gratitude which his kind|ne&s;s&mdash;."
She would have fini&s;hed
the &s;entence, but the words died away
upon her lips, and &s;he threw her&s;elf on
the bo&s;om of her mother, concealing her
di&s;tre&s;s, and wept in &s;ilence. The
Counte&s;s too well under&s;tood the grief
of her daughter; &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed the
&s;ecret &s;truggles of her heart, which all
her endeavours were not able to era&s;e,
and which rendered the offers of the
Count di&s;gu&s;ting, and dreadful to her
imagination. Matilda knew how to
feel for her &s;ufferings, but the affection
of the mother extended her views be|yond
the pre&s;ent temporary evil, to the
future welfare of her child; and in the
long per&s;pective of &s;ucceeding years, &s;he
beheld her united to the Count, who&s;e
character diffu&s;ed happine&s;s, and the
mild dignity of virtue to all around him;
<PB N="204" REF="218">
&s;he received the thanks of Mary for her
gentle guidance to the good &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed;
the artle&s;s looks of the little
ones around her, &s;miled their thanks;
and the luxury of that &s;cene recalled the
memory of times for ever pa&s;&s;ed, and
mingled with the tear of rapture, the
&s;igh of fond regret. The &s;ure&s;t method
of era&s;ing that affection which threat|ened
&s;erious evil to the peace of her
child if &s;uffered to continue, and to
&s;ecure her permanent felicity, was to
unite her to the Count; who&s;e amiable
di&s;po&s;itions would &s;oon win her affecti|ons,
and obliterate from her heart every
improper remembrance of Alleyn. She
determined, therefore, to employ argu|ment
and gentle per&s;ua&s;ion, to guide
her to her purpo&s;e. She knew the mind
of Mary to be delicate and candid;
ea&s;y of conviction, and firm to pur&s;ue
what her judgment approved; and &s;he
did not de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="219">
The Earl &s;till pre&s;&s;ed to know the
cau&s;e of that emotion which afflicted
her. "I am unworthy of your &s;oli|citude,"
&s;aid Mary, "I cannot teach
my heart to &s;ubmit." "To &s;ubmit!&mdash;Can
you &s;uppo&s;e your friends can
wi&s;h your heart to &s;ubmit on a point &s;o
material to its happine&s;s, to ought that
is repugnant to its feelings? If the
offers of the Count are di&s;plea&s;ing to
you, tell me &s;o; and I will return him his
an&s;wer. Believe that my fir&s;t wi&s;h is to
&s;ee you happy." "Generous O&s;bert!
How can I repay the goodne&s;s of &s;uch
a brother! I would accept in gratitude
the hand of the Count, did not my feel|ings
a&s;&s;ure me I &s;hould be mi&s;erable.
I admire his character, and e&s;teem his
goodne&s;s; but alas!&mdash;why &s;hould I
conceal it from you?&mdash;My heart is
another's&mdash;is another's, who&s;e noble
deeds have won its involuntary regards;
one who is yet uncon&s;cious of my di&s;|tinction,
and who &s;hall for ever remain
<PB N="206" REF="220">
in ignorance of it." The idea of Alleyn
fla&s;hed into the mind of the Earl, and
he no longer doubted to whom her
heart was engaged. "My own &s;enti|ments,"
&s;aid he, "&s;ufficiently inform
me of the object of your admiration.
You do well to remember the dignity
of your &s;ex and of your rank; though I
mu&s;t lament with you, that worth like
Alleyn's is not impowered by fortune to
take its &s;tandard with nobility." At
Alleyn's name, the blu&s;hes of Mary con|firmed
O&s;bert in his di&s;covery. "My
child," &s;aid the Counte&s;s, "will not
re&s;ign her tranquillity to a vain and
ignoble attachment. She may e&s;teem
merit wherever it is found, but &s;he will
remember the duty which &s;he owes to
her family and to her&s;elf, in contracting
an alliance which is to &s;upport or dimi|ni&s;h
the ancient con&s;equence of her
hou&s;e. The offers of a man endowed
with &s;o much apparent excellence as
the Count, and who&s;e birth is equal to
<PB N="207" REF="221">
your own, affords a pro&s;pect too pro|mi&s;ing
of felicity, to be ha&s;tily re|jected.
We will hereafter conver&s;e
more largely on this &s;ubject." "Ne|ver
&s;hall you have rea&s;on to blu&s;h
for your daughter," &s;aid Mary, with
a mode&s;t pride; "but pardon me,
Madam, if I entreat that we no more
renew a &s;ubject &s;o painful to my fee|lings,
and which cannot be productive
of good;&mdash;for never will I give my
hand where my heart does not ac|company
it." This was not a time
to pre&s;s the topic; the Counte&s;s for
the pre&s;ent de&s;i&s;ted, and the Earl left
the apartment with an heart divided be|tween
pity and di&s;appointment. Hope,
however, whi&s;pered to his wi&s;hes, that
Mary might in time be induced to admit
the addre&s;&s;es of the Count, and he de|termined
not wholly to de&s;troy his hopes.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THE Count was walking on the
ramparts of the ca&s;tle, involved
in thought, when O&s;bert approached;
who&s;e lingering &s;tep and di&s;appointed
air, &s;poke to his heart the rejection of
his &s;uit. He told the Count that Mary
did not at pre&s;ent feel for him tho&s;e
&s;entiments of affection which would
ju&s;tify her in accepting his propo&s;als.
This information, though it &s;hocked
the hopes of the Count, did not entirely
de&s;troy them; for he yet believed that
time and a&s;&s;iduity might befriend his
wi&s;hes. While the&s;e Noblemen were
leaning on the walls of the ca&s;tle, en|gaged
in earne&s;t conver&s;ation, they ob|&s;erved
on a di&s;tant hill a cloud emerging
from the verge of the horizon, who&s;e
du&s;ky hue glittered with &s;udden light;
<PB N="209" REF="223">
in an in&s;tant they de&s;cried the glance of
arms, and a troop of armed men poured
in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion over the hill, and
hurried down its &s;ide to the plains be|low.
The Earl thought he recognized
the clan of the Baron. It was the Baron
him&s;elf who now advanced at the head
of his people, in &s;earch of that revenge
which had been hitherto denied him;
and who, determined on conque&s;t, had
brought with him an ho&s;t which he
thought more than &s;ufficient to over|whelm
the ca&s;tle of his enemy.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger who had been &s;ent
with the challenge, had been detained a
pri&s;oner by Malcolm; who, in the mean
time, had ha&s;tened his preparations to
&s;urprize the ca&s;tle of Athlin. The de|tention
of his &s;ervant had awakened
the &s;u&s;picions of the Earl, and he had
taken precautions to guard again&s;t the
de&s;igns of his enemy. He had &s;um|moned
his clan to hold them&s;elves in
<PB N="210" REF="224">
readine&s;s for a &s;udden attack, and had
prepared his ca&s;tle for the wor&s;t emer|gency.
He now &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to
the clan with &s;uch orders as he judged
expedient, arranged his plans within the
walls, and took his &s;tation on the ram|parts
to ob&s;erve the movements of his
enemy. The Count, clad in arms, &s;tood
by his &s;ide. Alleyn was po&s;ted with a
party within the great gate of the
ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Baron advanced with his people,
and quickly &s;urrounded the walls. With|in
all was &s;ilent; the ca&s;tle &s;eemed to
repo&s;e in &s;ecurity; and the Baron, certain
of victory, congratulated him&s;elf on the
&s;ucce&s;&s; of the enterprize, when ob&s;erv|ing
the Earl, who&s;e per&s;on was concealed
in armour, he called to him to &s;urrender
him&s;elf and his Chief to the arms of
Malcolm. The Earl an&s;wered the &s;um|mons
with an arrow from his bow,
which, mi&s;&s;ing the Baron, pierced one of
<PB N="211" REF="225">
his attendants. The archers who had been
planted behind the walls, now di&s;covered
them&s;elves, and di&s;charged a &s;hower of
arrows; at the &s;ame time every part of
the ca&s;tle appeared thronged with the
&s;oldiers of the Earl, who hurled on the
heads of the a&s;tonished be&s;iegers, launces
and other mi&s;&s;il weapons with uncea&s;ing
rapidity. The alarum bell now rung
out the &s;ignal to that part of the clan
without the walls, and they immedi|ately
poured upon the enemy, who,
confounded by this unexpected attack,
had &s;carcely time to defend them&s;elves.
The clang of arms re&s;ounded through
the air, with the &s;houts of the victors
and the groans of the dying. The fear
of the Baron, which had principally
operated on the minds of his people,
was now overcome by &s;urprize, and the
fear of death; and on the fir&s;t repul&s;e,
they de&s;erted from the ranks in great
numbers, and fled to the di&s;tant hills.
In vain the Baron endeavoured to rally
<PB N="212" REF="226">
his &s;oldiers, and keep them to the
charge; they yielded to a &s;tronger im|pul&s;e
than the menaces of their Chief,
who was now left with le&s;s than half his
numbers at the foot of the walls. The
Baron, to whom cowardice was un|known,
di&s;daining to retreat, continued
the attack. At length the gates of the
ca&s;tle were thrown open, and a party
i&s;&s;ued upon the a&s;&s;ailants, headed by the
Earl and the Count, who divided in
que&s;t of Malcolm. The Count &s;ought
in vain, and the &s;earch of O&s;bert was
equally fruitle&s;s; their adver&s;ary was
no where to be found. O&s;bert, appre|hen&s;ive
of his gaining admittance to the
ca&s;tle by &s;tratagem, was returning in
ha&s;te to the gates, when he received the
&s;troke of a &s;word upon his &s;houlder;
his armour had broke the force of the
blow, and the wound it had given was
&s;light. He turned his &s;word, and facing
his enemy, di&s;covered a &s;oldier of Mal|colm's,
who attacked him with a de&s;pe|rate
<PB N="213" REF="227">
courage. The encounter was fu|rious
and long; dexterity and equal
valour &s;eemed to animate both the com|batants.
Alleyn, who ob&s;erved from
his po&s;t the danger of the Earl, flew in|&s;tantly
to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the cri&s;is
of the &s;cene was pa&s;t ere he arrived;
the weapon of O&s;bert had pierced the
&s;ide of his adver&s;ary, and he fell to the
ground. The Earl di&s;armed him, and
holding over him his &s;word, bade him
a&s;k his life. "I have no life to a&s;k,"
&s;aid Malcolm, who&s;e fainting voice the
Earl now di&s;covered, "if I had, 'tis
death only I would accept from you.
O! cur&s;ed!&mdash;." He would have
fini&s;hed the &s;entence, but his wound
flowed apace, and he fainted with lo&s;s
of blood. The Earl threw down his
&s;word, and calling a party of his people,
he committed to them the care of the
Baron, and ordered them to proceed and
&s;eize the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. Under|&s;tanding
their Chief was mortally
<PB N="214" REF="228">
wounded, the remains of Malcolm's
army had fled from the walls. The peo|ple
of the Earl proceeded without inter|ruption,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The wounds of the Baron were
examined when he reached Dunbayne,
and a dubious &s;entence of the event
was pronounced. His countenance
marked the powerful workings of
his mind, which &s;eemed labouring
with an unknown evil; he threw his
eyes eagerly round the apartment, as if
in &s;earch of &s;ome object which was not
pre&s;ent. After &s;everal attempts to &s;peak,
"Flatter me not," &s;aid he, "with hopes
of life; it is flitting fa&s;t away; but
while I have breath to &s;peak, let me &s;ee
the Barone&s;s." She came, and hanging
over his couch in &s;ilent horror, received
his words. "I have injured you,
Madam, I fear beyond reparation. In
the&s;e la&s;t few moments let me endea|vour
to relieve my con&s;cience by di&s;co|vering
<PB N="215" REF="229">
to you my guilt and my re|mor&s;e."
The Barone&s;s &s;tarted, &s;earful
of the coming &s;entence. "You had a
&s;on." "What of my &s;on?" "You
had a &s;on whom my boundle&s;s ambition
doomed to exile from his parents and
his heritage, and who I cau&s;ed you to
believe had died in your ab&s;ence."
"Where is my child?" exclaimed the
Barone&s;s. "I know not," re&s;umed
Malcolm, "I committed him to the
care of a man and woman who then
lived on a remote part of my lands, but
a few years after they di&s;appeared, and
I have never heard of them &s;ince. The
boy pa&s;&s;ed for a foundling whom I had
&s;aved from peri&s;hing. One &s;ervant only
I entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret; the re&s;t
were impo&s;ed upon. Thus far I tell
you, Madam, to prompt you to enqui|ry,
and to a&s;&s;uage the agonies of a bleed|ing
con&s;cience. I have other deeds
&mdash;." The Barone&s;s could hear no
more; she was carried in&s;en&s;ible &s;rom
<PB N="216" REF="230">
the apartment. Laura, &s;hocked at her
condition, was informed of its cau&s;e,
and filial tenderne&s;s watched over her
with unwearied attention.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Earl, on quit|ting
Malcolm, had returned immediate|ly
to the ca&s;tle, and was the fir&s;t me&s;&s;en|ger
of that event which would probably
avenge the memory of his father, and
terminate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his family.
The &s;ight of O&s;bert, and the news he
brought, revived the Counte&s;s and Ma|ry,
who had retired during the a&s;&s;ault
into an inner apartment of the ca&s;tle for
greater &s;ecurity, and who had &s;uffered
during that period all the terrors which
their &s;ituation could in&s;pire. They
were &s;oon after joined by the Count and
by Alleyn, who&s;e conduct did not pa&s;s
unnoticed by the Earl. The cheek of
Mary glowed at the relation of this
New in&s;tance of his worth; and it
was Alleyn's &s;weet reward to ob&s;erve
<PB N="217" REF="231">
her emotion. There was a &s;entiment
in the heart of O&s;bert which &s;truggled
again&s;t the pride of birth; he wi&s;hed to
reward the &s;ervices and the noble &s;pirit
of the youth, with the virtues of Mary;
but the authority of early prejudice
&s;ilenced the grateful impul&s;e, and &s;wept
from his heart the characters of truth.</P>
<P>The Earl, accompanied by the Count,
now ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne,
to cheer the Barone&s;s and her daughter
with their pre&s;ence. As they approached
the ca&s;tle, the &s;tillne&s;s and de&s;olation of
the &s;cene be&s;poke the &s;ituation of its
lord; his people were entirely di&s;per&s;ed,
a few only of his centinels wandered
before the ea&s;tern gate; who, having
made no oppo&s;ition, were &s;uffered by
the Earl's people to remain. Few of
the Baron's people were to be &s;een;
tho&s;e few were unarmed, and appeared
the effigies of fallen greatne&s;s. As the
Earl cro&s;&s;ed the platform, the remem|brance
of the pa&s;t crowded upon his
<PB N="218" REF="232">
mind. The agonies which he had there
&s;uffered,&mdash;the image of death which
glared upon his &s;ight, aggravated by
the bitter and ignominious circum|&s;tances
which attended his fate; the
figure of Malcolm, mighty in inju&s;tice,
and cruel in power; who&s;e counte|nance,
&s;miling horribly in triumphant
revenge, &s;ent to his heart the &s;troke of
angui&s;h;&mdash;each circum&s;tance of tor|ture
aro&s;e to his imagination in the
glowing colours of truth; he &s;huddered
as he pa&s;&s;ed; and the contra&s;t of the
pre&s;ent &s;cene touched his heart with the
mo&s;t affecting &s;entiments. He &s;aw the
innate and active power of ju&s;tice, which
pervades all the circum&s;tances even of
this lifelike vital principle, and &s;hines
through the ob&s;curity of human acti|ons
to the virtuous, the pure ray of
Heaven;&mdash;to the guilty, the de&s;truc|tive
glare of lightning.</P>
<P>On enquiring for the Barone&s;s, they
<PB N="219" REF="233">
were told &s;he was in the apartment of
Malcolm, who&s;e moment of di&s;&s;olution
was now approaching. The name of
the Count was delivered to the Barone&s;s,
and overheard by the Baron, who de&s;ired
to &s;ee him. Loui&s;a went out to receive
her noble relation with all the joy
which a meeting &s;o de&s;irable and &s;o un-looked
for, could in&s;pire. On &s;eeing
O&s;bert, her tears flowed fa&s;t; and &s;he
thanked him for his generous care, in a
manner that declared a deep &s;en&s;e of his
&s;ervices. Leaving him, &s;he conducted
the Count to Malcolm, who lay on his
couch &s;urrounded with the &s;tillne&s;s and
horrors of death. He rai&s;ed his languid
head, and di&s;covered a countenance wild
and terrific, who&s;e gha&s;tly a&s;pect was
over&s;pread with the palene&s;s of death.
The beauteous Laura, overcome by the
&s;cene, hung like a drooping lilly over
his couch, dropping fa&s;t her tears.
"My lord," &s;aid Malcolm, in a low
tone, "you &s;ee before you a wretch,
<PB N="220" REF="234">
anxious to relieve the agony of a guilty
mind. My vices have de&s;troyed the
peace of this lady,&mdash;have robbed her of
a &s;on&mdash;but &s;he will di&s;clo&s;e to you the
&s;ecret guilt, which I have now no time
to tell. I have for &s;ome years received,
as you now well know, the income of
tho&s;e foreign lands which are her due;
as a &s;mall reparation for the injuries &s;he
has &s;u&s;tained, I bequeath to her all the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which I lawfully inherit, and
re&s;ign her into your protection. To
a&s;k oblivion of the pa&s;t of you, Madam,
and of you, my Lord, is what I dare not
do; yet it would be &s;ome con&s;olation
to my departing &s;pirit, to be a&s;&s;ured of
your forgivene&s;s." The Barone&s;s was
too much affected to reply but by a look
of a&s;&s;ent; the Count a&s;&s;ured him of
forgivene&s;s, and be&s;ought him to com|po&s;e
his mind for his approaching fate.
"Compo&s;ure, my Lord, is not for me;
my life has been marked with vice, and
my death with the bitterne&s;s of fruitle&s;s
<PB N="221" REF="235">
remor&s;e. I have under&s;tood virtue, but
I have loved vice. I do not now lament
that I am puni&s;hed, but that I have de|&s;erved
puni&s;hment." The Baron &s;unk
on his couch, and in a few moments af|ter
expired in a &s;trong &s;igh. Thus ter|minated
the life of a man, who&s;e un|der&s;tanding
might have reached the hap|pine&s;s
of virtue, but who&s;e actions di&s;|played
the features of vice.</P>
<P>From this melancholy &s;cene, the Ba|rone&s;s,
with the Count and Laura, re|tired
to her apartment, where the Earl
awaited their return with anxious &s;oli|citude.
The &s;ternne&s;s of ju&s;tice for a
moment relaxed when he heard of Mal|colm's
death; his heart would have
&s;ighed with compa&s;&s;ion, had not the re|membrance
of his father cro&s;&s;ed his
mind, and checked the impul&s;e. "I
can now, Madam," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing
the Barone&s;s, "re&s;tore you a part of
tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which were once your
<PB N="222" REF="236">
Lord's, and which ought to have been
the inheritance of your &s;on; this ca&s;tle
from henceforth is your's; I re&s;ign it to
its lawful owner." The Barone&s;s was
overcome with the remembrance of his
&s;ervices, and could &s;carcely thank him
but with her tears. The &s;ervant whom
the Baron had mentioned as the confi|dant
of his iniquities, was &s;ent for, and
interrogated concerning the infant he
had charge of. From him, however,
little comfort was received; for he could
only tell, that he had conveyed the
child, by the orders of his ma&s;ter, to a
cottage on the furthe&s;t borders of his
e&s;tates, where he had delivered it to the
care of a woman, who there lived with
her hu&s;band. The&s;e people received at
the &s;ame time, a &s;um of money for its
&s;upport, with a promi&s;e of future &s;up|plies.
That for &s;ome years he had been
punctual in the payment of the &s;ums
entru&s;ted to him by the Baron, but at
length he yielded to the temptation of
<PB N="223" REF="237">
with-holding them for his own u&s;e; and
on enquiring for the people &s;ome years
after, he found they were gone from the
place. The conditions of the Ba|rone&s;s's
pardon to the man, depended
on his endeavours to repair the injury
he had promoted, by a &s;trict &s;earch for
the people to whom he had committed
her child. She now con&s;ulted with her
friends on the be&s;t means to be pur&s;ued
in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and immediately &s;ent off
me&s;&s;engers to different parts of the
country to gather information.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s was now relea&s;ed from
oppre&s;&s;ion and impri&s;onment; &s;he was
re-in&s;tated in her ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to
which were added all the hereditary
lands of Malcolm, together with his
per&s;onal fortune: &s;he was &s;urrounded
by tho&s;e whom &s;he mo&s;t loved, and in
the mid&s;t of a people who loved her;
yet the con&s;equence of the Baron's
guilt had left in her heart one drop of
<PB N="224" REF="238">
gall which embittered each &s;ource of
happine&s;s, and made her life melancholy
and painful.</P>
<P>The Count was now her vi&s;itor; &s;he
was much con&s;oled by his pre&s;ence;
and Laura's hours were often enlivened
by the conver&s;ation of the Earl, to whom
her heart was tenderly attached, and
who&s;e frequent vi&s;its to the ca&s;tle, were
devoted to love and her.</P>
<P>The felicity of Matilda now appeared
as perfect and as permanent as is con&s;i&s;t|ent
with the nature of &s;ublunary beings.
Ju&s;tice was done to the memory of her
Lord, and her beloved &s;on was &s;pared to
ble&s;s the evening of her days. The father
of Laura had ever been friendly to the
hou&s;e of Athlin, and her delicacy felt
no repugnance to the union which
O&s;bert &s;olicited. But her happine&s;s,
whatever it might appear, was incom|plete;
&s;he &s;aw the &s;ettled melancholy of
<PB N="225" REF="239">
Mary, for love &s;till corroded her heart,
and notwith&s;tanding her efforts, &s;haded
her a&s;pect. The Counte&s;s wi&s;hed to
produce tho&s;e nuptials with the Count,
which &s;he thought would re-e&s;tabli&s;h
the peace of her child, and in&s;ure her
future felicity. She omitted no oppor|tunity
of pre&s;&s;ing his &s;uit, which &s;he
managed with a delicacy that rendered
it le&s;s painful to Mary; who&s;e words,
however, were few in reply, and who
could &s;eldom bear the &s;ubject to be long
continued. Her &s;ettled aver&s;ion to the
addre&s;&s;es of the Count, at length baffled
the expectations of Matilda, and &s;hewed
her the fallacy of her efforts. She
thought it improper to &s;uffer the Count
any longer to nouri&s;h in his heart a vain
hope; and &s;he reluctantly commi&s;&s;ioned
the Earl to undeceive him on this
point.</P>
<P>With the Barone&s;s, month after
month &s;till elap&s;ed in fruitle&s;s &s;earch of
<PB N="226" REF="240">
her &s;on; the people with whom he had
been placed were no where to be found,
and no track was di&s;covered which
might lead to the truth. The di&s;tre&s;s
of the Barone&s;s can only be imagined;
&s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf in calm de&s;pair to
mourn in &s;ilence, the ea&s;y confidence
which had entru&s;ted her child to the care
of tho&s;e who had betrayed him. Though
happine&s;s was denied her, &s;he was un|willing
to with-hold it from tho&s;e whom
it awaited; and at length yielded to
the entreaties of the Earl, and became
his advocate with Laura, for the nup|tials
which were to unite their fate.</P>
<P>The Earl introduced the Counte&s;s
and Mary to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne.
Similarity of &s;entiment and di&s;po&s;ition
united Matilda and the Barone&s;s in a
la&s;ting friend&s;hip. Mary and Laura
were not le&s;s plea&s;ed with each other.
The dejection of the Count at &s;ight of
Mary, declared the ardor of his pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="227" REF="241">
and would have awakened in her brea&s;t
&s;omething more than compa&s;&s;ion, had
not her heart been pre-occupied. Al|leyn,
who could think of Mary only,
wandered through the ca&s;tle of Athlin a
&s;olitary being, who fondly haunts the
&s;pot where his happine&s;s lies buried.
His prudence formed re&s;olutions which
his pa&s;&s;ion as quickly broke; and cheat|ed
by love, though followed by de&s;pair,
he delayed his departure from day to
day, and the illu&s;ion of ye&s;terday conti|nued
to be the illu&s;ion of the morrow.
The Earl, attached to his virtues, and
grateful for his &s;ervices, would have
be&s;towed on him every honour but that
alone which could give him happine&s;s,
and which his pride would have &s;uffered
him to accept. Yet the honours which
he refu&s;ed&mdash;he refu&s;ed with a grace &s;o
mode&s;t, as to conciliate kindne&s;s rather
than wound genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>In a gallery on the North &s;ide of the
<PB N="228" REF="242">
ca&s;tle, which was filled with pictures of
the family, hung a portrait of Mary.
She was drawn in the dre&s;s which &s;he
wore on the day of the fe&s;tival, when
&s;he was led by the Earl into the hall,
and pre&s;ented as the partner of Alleyn.
The likene&s;s was &s;triking, and expre&s;|&s;ive
of all the winning grace of the ori|ginal.
As often as Alleyn could &s;teal
from ob&s;ervation, he retired to this gal|lery
to contemplate the portrait of her
who was ever pre&s;ent to his imagina|tion:
here he could breathe that &s;igh
which her pre&s;ence re&s;trained, and &s;hed
tho&s;e tears which her pre&s;ence forbade
to flow. As he &s;tood one day in this
place, wrapt in melancholy mu&s;ing, his
ear was &s;truck with the notes of sweet
mu&s;ic; they &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the
bottom of the gallery. The in&s;trument
was touched with an exqui&s;ite expre&s;&s;i|on,
and in a voice who&s;e tones floated
on the air in &s;oft undulations; he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the following words, which he
<PB N="229" REF="243">
remembered to be an ode compo&s;ed
by the Earl, and pre&s;ented to Mary,
who had &s;et it to mu&s;ic the day before.</P>

<P>Entranced in the &s;weet &s;ounds, he
had proceeded &s;ome &s;teps down the
gallery, when the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. He
&s;topped. After a &s;hort pau&s;e it re|turned,
and as he advanced he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the&s;e words, &s;ung in a low voice
mournfully &s;weet:
<Q><L>In &s;olitude I mourn thy reign,</L>
<L>Ah! youth belov'd&mdash;but lov'd in vain!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="245">
The voice was broken, and lo&s;t in
&s;obs; the chords of the lute were wildly
&s;truck: and in a few moments &s;ilence
en&s;ued. He &s;tepped on towards the
&s;pot whence the &s;ounds had proceeded,
and through a door which was left open,
he di&s;covered Mary hanging over her
lute di&s;&s;olved in tears. He &s;tood for
&s;ome moments ab&s;orbed in mute admi|ration,
and unob&s;erved by Mary, who
was lo&s;t in her tears, till a &s;igh which
e&s;caped him, recalled her to reality; &s;he
rai&s;ed her eyes, and beheld the object
of her &s;ecret &s;orrows. She aro&s;e in con|fu&s;ion;
the blu&s;h on her cheek betrayed
her heart; &s;he was retiring in ha&s;te from
Alleyn, who remained at the entrance
of the room the &s;tatue of de&s;pair, when
&s;he was intercepted by the Earl, who
entered by the door &s;he was opening;
her eyes were red with weeping; he
glanced on her a look of &s;urprize and
di&s;plea&s;ure, and pa&s;&s;ed on to the gallery
followed by Alleyn, who was now awak|ened
<PB N="232" REF="246">
from his trance. "From you,
Alleyn," &s;aid the Earl, in a tone of di&s;|plea&s;ure,
"I expected other conduct;
on your word I relied, and your word
has deceived me." "Hear me,
my Lord," returned the youth, "your
confidence I have never abu&s;ed; hear
me." "I have now no time for parley,"
replied O&s;bert, "my moments are pre|cious;
&s;ome future hour of lei&s;ure may
&s;uffice." So &s;aying, he walked away
with an abrupt haughtine&s;s, which
touched the &s;oul of Alleyn, who di&s;|dained
to pur&s;ue him with further ex|planation.
He was now completely
wretched. The &s;ame accident which
had unveiled to him the heart of Mary,
and the full extent of that happine&s;s
which fate with-held, confirmed him in
de&s;pair. The &s;ame accident had ex|po&s;ed
the delicacy of her he loved to a

to &s;u&s;picion; and to a &s;evere re|buke
from him, by whom it was his
<PB N="233" REF="247">
pride to be re&s;pected, and for who&s;e
&s;afety he had &s;uffered impri&s;onment, and
encountered death.</P>
<P>Mary had quitted the clo&s;et di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
and perplexed. She perceived the mi&s;|take
of the Earl, and it &s;hocked her.
She wi&s;hed to undeceive him, but he
was gone to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, to
pay one of tho&s;e vi&s;its which were &s;oon
to conclude in the nuptials, and whence
he did not return till evening. The
&s;cene which he had witne&s;&s;ed in the
morning, involved him in a tumult of
di&s;tre&s;s. He con&s;idered the mutual pa&s;|&s;ion
which filled the bo&s;om of his &s;i&s;ter
and Alleyn; he had &s;urprized them in a
&s;olitary apartment; he had ob&s;erved
the tender and melancholy air of Alleyn,
and the tears and confu&s;ion of Mary;
and he at fir&s;t did not he&s;itate to believe
that the interview had been appointed. In
the heat of his di&s;plea&s;ure he had reject|ed
the explanation of Alleyn with a
<PB N="234" REF="248">
haughty re&s;entment, which the late &s;cene
alone could have excited, and which the
delu&s;ion it had occa&s;ioned alone could
excu&s;e. Cooler con&s;ideration, however,
brought to his mind the delicacy and the
amiable pride of Mary, and the integrity
of Alleyn; and he accu&s;ed him&s;elf of a
too ha&s;ty deci&s;ion. The zealous &s;ervices
of Alleyn came to his heart; he repented
that he had treated him &s;o rigorou&s;ly;
and on his return enquired for him, that
he might hear an explanation, and that
he might &s;often the a&s;perity of his for|mer
behaviour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>ALLEYN was no where to be
found. The Earl went him&s;elf in
que&s;t of him, but without &s;ucce&s;s. As
he returned from the terrace, chagrined
and di&s;appointed, he ob&s;erved two per|&s;ons
cro&s;s the platform at &s;ome di&s;tance
before him; and he could perceive by
the dim moon-light which fell upon the
&s;pot, that they were not of the ca&s;tle.
He called to them; no an&s;wer was re|turned;
but at the &s;ound of his voice
they quickened their pace, and almo&s;t
in&s;tantly di&s;appeared in the darkne&s;s of
the ramparts. Surprized at this phoe|nomenon,
the Earl followed with ha&s;ty
&s;teps, and endeavoured to pur&s;ue the
way they had taken. He walked on
&s;ilently, but there was no &s;ound to di|rect
<PB N="236" REF="250">
his &s;teps. When he came to the
extremity of the rampart, which formed
the North angle of the ca&s;tle, he &s;topped
to examine the &s;pot, and to li&s;ten if any
thing was &s;tirring. No per&s;on was to be
&s;een, and all was hu&s;hed. After he had
&s;tood &s;ome time &s;urveying the rampart,
he heard the low re&s;trained voice of a
per&s;on unknown, but the di&s;tance pre|vented
his di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;ubject of
the conver&s;ation. The voice &s;eemed to
approach the place where he &s;tood. He
drew his &s;word, and watched in &s;ilence
their motions. They continued to ad|vance,
till &s;uddenly &s;topping, they
turned, and took a long &s;urvey of the
fabric. Their di&s;cour&s;e was conducted
in a low tone; but the Earl could di&s;|cover
by the vehemence of their ge&s;ture,
and the caution of their &s;teps, that they
were upon &s;ome de&s;ign dangerous to the
peace of the ca&s;tle. Having fini&s;hed
their examination, they turned again to|wards
the place where the Earl &s;till re|mained;
<PB N="237" REF="251">
the &s;hade of a high turret con|cealed
him from their view, and they
continued to approach till they arrived
within a &s;hort &s;pace of him, when they
turned through a ruined arch-way of
the ca&s;tle, and were lo&s;t in the dark re|ce&s;&s;es
of the pile. A&s;toni&s;hed at what he
had &s;een, O&s;bert ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle,
whence he di&s;patched &s;ome of his peo|ple
in &s;earch of the unknown fugitives;
he accompanied &s;ome of his dome&s;tics
to the &s;pot where they had la&s;t di&s;ap|peared.
They entered the arch-way,
which led to a decayed part of the ca&s;|tle;
they followed over broken pave|ment
the remains of a pa&s;&s;age, which was
clo&s;ed by a low ob&s;cure door almo&s;t
concealed from &s;ight by the thick ivy
which over&s;hadowed it. On opening
this door, they de&s;cended a flight of
&s;teps which led under the pile, &s;o ex|tremely
narrow and broken as to make
the de&s;cent both difficult and dangerous.
The powerful damps of long pent-up
<PB N="238" REF="252">
vapours extingui&s;hed their light, and
the Earl and his attendants were com|pelled
to remain in utter darkne&s;s
while one of them went round to the
habitable part of the ca&s;tle to relume
the lamp. While they awaited in &s;ilence
the return of light, a &s;hort breathing
was di&s;tinctly heard at intervals, near the
place where they &s;tood. The &s;ervants
&s;hook with fear, and the Earl was not
wholly unmoved. They remained en|tirely
&s;ilent, li&s;tening its return, when a
&s;ound of foot&s;teps &s;lowly &s;tealing
through the vault, &s;tartled them. The
Earl demanded who pa&s;&s;ed;&mdash;he was
an&s;wered only by the deep echoes of his
voice. They cla&s;hed their &s;words and
had advanced, when the &s;teps ha&s;tily
retired before them. The Earl ru&s;hed
forward, pur&s;uing the &s;ound, till over|taking
the per&s;on who fled, he &s;eized
him; a &s;hort &s;cuffle en&s;ued; the &s;trength
of O&s;bert was too powerful for his anta|goni&s;t,
who was nearly overcome, when
<PB N="239" REF="253">
the point of a &s;word from an unknown
hand pierced his &s;ide, he relinqui&s;h|ed
his gra&s;p, and fell to the ground.
His dome&s;tics, whom the activity of
their ma&s;ter had outran, now came up;
but the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, whoever they were,
had accomplished their e&s;cape, for the
&s;ound of their &s;teps was quickly lo&s;t in
the di&s;tance of the vaults. They endea|voured
to rai&s;e the Earl, who lay &s;peech|le&s;s
on the ground; but they knew not
how to convey him from that place of
horror, for they were yet in total dark|ne&s;s,
and unacquainted with the place.
In this &s;ituation, every moment of delay
appeared an age. Some of them tried
to grope their way to the entrance, but
their efforts were defeated by the dark|ne&s;s,
and the ruinous &s;ituation of the
place. The light at length appeared,
and di&s;covered the Earl in&s;en&s;ible, and
weltering in his blood. He was con|veyed
into the ca&s;tle, where the horror
of the Counte&s;s on &s;eeing him borne in|to
<PB N="240" REF="254">
the hall, may be ea&s;ily imagined.
By the help of proper applications he
was re&s;tored to life; his wound was ex|amined,
and found to be dangerous; and
he was carried to bed in a &s;tate which
gave very faint hopes of recovery. The
a&s;toni&s;hment of the Counte&s;s on hearing
the adventure, was equalled only by her
di&s;tre&s;s. All her conjectures concern|ing
the de&s;igns and the identity of the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, were vague and uncertain. She
knew not on whom to fix the &s;tigma;
nor could di&s;cover any means by which
to penetrate this my&s;terious affair. The
people who had remained in the vaults
to pur&s;ue the &s;earch, now returned to
Matilda. Every rece&s;s of the ca&s;tle, and
every part of the ramparts had been
explored, yet no one could be found;
and the my&s;tery of the proceeding was
heightened by the manner in which the
men had effected their e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Mary watched over her brother in
<PB N="241" REF="255">
&s;ilent angui&s;h, yet &s;he &s;trove to conceal
her di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he might encourage
the Counte&s;s to hope. The Counte&s;s
endeavoured to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the
event with a kind of de&s;perate fortitude.
There is a certain point of mi&s;ery, be|yond
which the mind becomes callous,
and acquires a &s;ort of artificial calm.
Exce&s;s of mi&s;ery may be &s;aid to bla&s;t
the vital powers of feeling, and by a
natural con&s;equence con&s;umes its own
principle. Thus it was with Matilda:
a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of trials had reduced
her to a &s;tate of horrid tranquillity,
which followed the fir&s;t &s;hock of the
pre&s;ent event. It was not &s;o with Lau|ra;
young in misfortune, and gay in
hope, &s;he &s;aw happine&s;s fade from her
gra&s;p with a warmth of feeling un|touched
by the chill of di&s;appointment.
When the news of the Earl's &s;ituation
reached her, &s;he was overcome with
affliction, and pined in &s;ilent angui&s;h.
The Count ha&s;tened to O&s;bert, but grief
<PB N="242" REF="256">
fat heavy at his heart, and he had no
power to offer to others the comfort
which he wanted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A fever, which was the con&s;equence
of his wounds, added to the danger of
the Earl, and to the de&s;pair of his fam|ily.
During this period, Alleyn had
not been &s;een at the ca&s;tle; and his ab|&s;ence
at this time, rai&s;ed in Mary a va|riety
of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing apprehen&s;ions. Of|bert
enquired for him, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee
him. The &s;ervant who had been &s;ent
to his father's cottage, brought word
that it was &s;ome days &s;ince he had been
there, and that nobody knew whither he
was gone. The &s;urprize was univer&s;al,
but the effect it produced was various
and oppo&s;ite. A collection of &s;trange and
concomitant circum&s;tances, now forced
a &s;u&s;picion on the mind of the Counte&s;s,
which her heart, and her remembrance
of the former conduct of Alleyn, at
<PB N="243" REF="257">
once condemned. She had heard of
what pa&s;&s;ed between the Earl and him in
the gallery; his immediate ab&s;ence; the
event which followed, and his &s;ub&s;e|quent
flight, formed a chain of evidence
which compelled her with the utmo&s;t
reluctance, to believe him concerned in
the affair which had once more involved
her hou&s;e in mi&s;ery. Mary had too
much confidence in her knowledge of
his character, to admit a &s;u&s;picion of
this nature. She rejected with in&s;tant
di&s;dain, the idea of uniting Alleyn with
di&s;honour; and that he &s;hould be guilty
of an action &s;o ba&s;e as the pre&s;ent, &s;oared
beyond all the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility.
Yet &s;he felt a &s;trange &s;olicitude concern|ing
him, and apprehen&s;ions for his &s;afe|ty
tormented her ince&s;&s;antly. The an|gui&s;h
in which he had quitted the apart|ment,
her brother's injurious treatment,
and his con&s;equent ab&s;ence, all con&s;pired
to make her fear that de&s;pair had driven
<PB N="244" REF="258">
him to commit &s;ome act of violence on
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Earl, in the delirium of the
fever, raved continually of Laura and
of Alleyn; they were the &s;ole &s;ubjects of
his ramblings. Seizing one day the
hand of Mary, who fat mournfully by
his bed-&s;ide, and looking for &s;ome time
pen&s;ively in her face, "weep not, my
Laura," &s;aid he, "Malcolm, nor all the
powers on earth &s;hall tear you from
me; his walls&mdash;his guards&mdash;what
are they? I'll wre&s;t you from his hold
or peri&s;h. I have a friend who&s;e valour
will do much for us;&mdash;a friend&mdash;O!
name him not; the&s;e are &s;trange times;
beware of tru&s;ting. I could have given
him my very life&mdash;but not&mdash;I will
not name him." Then &s;tarting to the
other &s;ide of the bed, and looking
earne&s;tly towards the door with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of &s;orrow not to be de&s;cribed,
<PB N="245" REF="259">
"not all the mi&s;eries which my wor&s;t
enemy has heaped upon me; not all the
horrors of impri&s;onment and death, have
ever touched my &s;oul with a &s;ting &s;o
&s;harp as thy unfaithfulne&s;s." Mary
was &s;o much &s;hocked by this &s;cene, that
&s;he left the room, and retired to her own
apartment to indulge the agony of grief
it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Earl grew daily
more alarming; and the fever, which had
not yet reached its cri&s;is, kept the hopes
and fears of his family &s;u&s;pended. In one
of his lucid intervals, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
to the Counte&s;s in the mo&s;t pathetic
manner, he reque&s;ted, that as death
might probably &s;oon &s;eparate him for
ever from her he mo&s;t loved, he might
&s;ee Laura once again before he died. She
came, and weeping over him, a &s;cene of
angui&s;h en&s;ued too poignant for de&s;crip|tion.
He gave her his la&s;t vows; &s;he
<PB N="246" REF="260">
took of him a la&s;t look; and with a
breaking heart tearing her&s;elf away, was
carried to Dunbayne in a &s;tate of danger
little inferior to his.</P>
<P>The agitation he had &s;uffered during
this interview, cau&s;ed a return of phren|zy
more violent than any fit he had yet
&s;uffered; exhau&s;ted by it, he at length
&s;unk into a &s;leep, which continued with|out
interruption for near four and twenty
hours. During this time his repo&s;e
was quiet and profound, and afforded
the Counte&s;s and Mary, who watched
over him alternately, the con&s;olations
of hope. When he awoke he was per|fectly
&s;en&s;ible, and in a very altered
&s;tate from that he had been in a few
hours before. The cri&s;is of the di&s;or|der
was now pa&s;t, and from that time it
rapidly declined till he was re&s;tored to
perfect health.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="261">
The joy of Laura, who&s;e health gra|dually
returned with returning peace,
and that of his family, was &s;uch as the
merits of the Earl de&s;erved. This joy,
however, &s;uffered a &s;hort interruption
from the Count of Santmorin, who, en|tering
one morning, the apartment of
the Barone&s;s, with letters in his hand,
came to acquaint her that he had ju&s;t
received news of the death of a di&s;tant
relation, who had bequeathed him &s;ome
e&s;tates of value, to which it was nece&s;|&s;ary
he &s;hould immediately lay claim;
and that he was, therefore, obliged, how|ever
reluctantly, to &s;et off for Switzer|land
without delay. Though the Ba|rone&s;s
rejoiced with all his friends, at
his good fortune, &s;he regretted with
them, the nece&s;&s;ity of his abrupt depar|ture.
He took leave of them, and par|ticularly
of Mary, for whom his pa&s;&s;ion
was &s;till the &s;ame, with much emotion;
and it was &s;ome time ere the &s;pace he
<PB N="248" REF="262">
had left in their &s;ociety was filled up,
and ere they re&s;umed their wonted
cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Preparations were now making for
the approaching nuptials, and the day
of their celebration was at length fixed.
The ceremony was to be performed
in a chapel belonging to the ca&s;tle of
Dunbayne, by the chaplain of the Ba|rone&s;s.
Mary only was to attend as
bride-maid; and the Counte&s;s al&s;o,
with the Barone&s;s, was to be pre&s;ent.
The ab&s;ence of the Count was uni|ver&s;ally
regretted; for from his hand,
the Earl was to have received his bride.
The office was now to be &s;upplied by
a neighbouring Laird, whom the fa|mily
of the Barone&s;s had long e&s;teemed.
At the earne&s;t reque&s;t of Laura, Mary
con&s;ented to &s;pend the night preceding
the day of marriage, at the ca&s;tle of
Dunbayne. The day &s;o long and &s;o
<PB N="249" REF="263">
anxiou&s;ly expected by the Earl, at
length arrived. The morning was ex|tremely
fine, and the joy which glowed
in his heart gave additional &s;plendor
to the &s;cene around him. He &s;et off,
accompanied by the Counte&s;s, for the
ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. He anticipated
the joy with which he &s;hould &s;oon re|trace
the way he then travelled, with
Laura by his &s;ide, whom death alone
could then &s;eparate from him. On
their arrival they were received by
the Barone&s;s, who enquired for Mary;
and the Counte&s;s and O&s;bert were
thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation,
when they learned that &s;he had not been
&s;een at the ca&s;tle. The nuptials were
again deferred; the ca&s;tle was a &s;cene
of univer&s;al confu&s;ion. The Earl re|turned
home in&s;tantly to di&s;patch his
people in &s;earch of Mary. On en|quiry,
he learned that the &s;ervants
who had attended her, had not been
<PB N="250" REF="264">
heard of &s;ince their departure with
their lady. Still more alarmed by
this intelligence, he rode him&s;elf in
pur&s;uit, yet not knowing which cour&s;e
to take. Several days were employed
in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch; no foot&s;tep of her
flight could be traced.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>MARY, in the mean time, &s;uffered
all the terror which her &s;ituation
could excite. On her way to Dun|bayne,
&s;he had been overtaken by a
party of armed men, who &s;eized her bri|dle,
and after engaging her &s;ervants in
a feigned re&s;i&s;tance, carried her off
&s;en&s;ele&s;s. On recovering, &s;he found her|&s;elf
travelling through a fore&s;t, who&s;e
glooms were deepened by the &s;hades of
night. The moon, which was now up,
glancing through the trees, &s;erved to
&s;hew the dreary a&s;pect of the place, and
the number of men who &s;urrounded her;
and &s;he was &s;eized with a terror that al|mo&s;t
deprived her of rea&s;on. They
travelled all night, during which a pro|found
&s;ilence was ob&s;erved. At the
dawn of day &s;he found her&s;elf on the
<PB N="252" REF="266">
&s;kirts of a heath, to who&s;e wide de&s;ola|tion
her eye could di&s;cover no limits.
Before they entered on the wa&s;te, they
halted at the entrance of a cave, formed
in a rock, which was overhung with
pine and fir; where, &s;preading their
breakfa&s;t on the gra&s;s, they offered re|fre&s;hments
to Mary, who&s;e mind was
too much di&s;tracted to &s;uffer her to par|take
of them. She implored them in the
mo&s;t moving accents, to tell her from
whom they came, and whither they
were carrying her; but they were in|&s;en&s;ible
to her tears and her entreaties,
and &s;he was compelled to await in &s;ilent
terror, the extremity of her fate. They
pur&s;ued their journey over the wilds,
and towards the clo&s;e of day approached
the ruins of an abbey, who&s;e broken
arches and lonely towers aro&s;e in
gloomy grandeur through the ob&s;curity
of evening. It &s;tood the &s;olitary inha|bitant
of the wa&s;tes,&mdash;a monument of
mortality and of ancient &s;uper&s;tititton,
<PB N="253" REF="267">
and the frowning maje&s;ty of its a&s;pect
&s;eemed to command &s;ilence and vene|ration.
The chilly dews fell thick, and
Mary fatigued in body, and hara&s;&s;ed
in mind, lay almo&s;t expiring on her
hor&s;e, when they &s;topped under an arch
of the ruin. She was not &s;o ill as to be
in&s;en&s;ible to the objects around her;
the awful &s;olitude of the place, and the
&s;olemn a&s;pect of the fabric, who&s;e effect
was heightened by the falling glooms
of evening, chilled her heart with hor|ror;
and when they took her from the
hor&s;e, &s;he &s;hrieked in the agonies of a
la&s;t de&s;pair. They bore her over loo&s;e
&s;tones to a part of the building, which
had been formerly the cloi&s;ters of the
abbey, but which was now fallen to
decay, and overgrown with ivy. There
was, however, at the extremity of the&s;e
cloi&s;ters a nook, which had with&s;tood
with hardier &s;trength the ravages of
time; the roof was here entire, and the
&s;hattered &s;tanchions of the ca&s;ements
<PB N="254" REF="268">
&s;till remained. Hither they carried
Mary, and laid her almo&s;t lifele&s;s on the
gra&s;&s;y pavement, while &s;ome of the ruf|fians
ha&s;tened to light a fire of the
heath and &s;ticks they could pick up.
They took out their provi&s;ions, and
placed them&s;elves round the fire, where
they had not long been &s;eated, when
the &s;ound of di&s;tant thunder foretold
an approaching &s;torm. A violent &s;torm,
accompanied with peals which &s;hook
the pile, came on. They were &s;hel|tered
from the heavine&s;s of the rain;
but the long and vivid fla&s;hes of light|ning
which glanced through the ca&s;e|ments,
alarmed them all. The &s;hrieks
of Mary were loud and continued;
and the fears of the ruffians did not pre|vent
their uttering dreadful impreca|tions
at her di&s;tre&s;s. One of them, in
the fury of his re&s;entment, &s;wore &s;he
&s;hould be gagged; and &s;eizing her re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s
hands to execute the purpo&s;e,
her cries redoubled. The &s;ervants who
<PB N="255" REF="269">
had betrayed her, were not yet &s;o en|tirely
lo&s;t to the feelings of humanity,
as to &s;tand regardle&s;s of her pre&s;ent di&s;|tre&s;s;
though they could not re&s;i&s;t the
temptations of a bribe, they were un|willing
their lady &s;hould be loaded with
unnece&s;&s;ary mi&s;ery. They oppo&s;ed the
ruffians; a di&s;pute en&s;ued; and the
violence of the conte&s;t aro&s;e &s;o high,
that they determined to fight for the
deci&s;ion. Amid the peals of thunder,
the oaths and execrations of the com|batants,
added terror to the &s;cene. The
&s;trength of the ruffians were &s;uperior to
that of their opponents; and Mary be|holding
victory deciding again&s;t her&s;elf,
uttered a loud &s;cream, when the atten|tion
of the whole party was &s;urprized
by the &s;ound of a foot&s;tep in the cloi&s;ter.
Immediately after, a man ru&s;hed into
the place, and drawing his &s;word, de|manded
the cau&s;e of the tumult. Mary,
who lay almo&s;t expiring on the ground,
now rai&s;ed her eyes; but what were
<PB N="256" REF="270">
her &s;en&s;ations, when &s;he rai&s;ed them to
Alleyn!&mdash;who now &s;tood before her
petrified with horror! Before he could
fly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the attacks of the
ruffians obliged him to defend him&s;elf;
he parried their blows for &s;ome time,
but he mu&s;t inevitably have yielded to
the force of numbers, had not the
trampling of feet, which fa&s;t approach|ed,
called off for a moment their atten|tion.
In an in&s;tant the place was filled
with men. The a&s;toni&s;hment of Alleyn,
was, if po&s;&s;ible, now encrea&s;ed; for the
Earl, followed by a party, now en|tered.
The Earl, when he perceived
Alleyn, &s;tood at the entrance, agha&s;t!
&mdash;But re&s;uming his firmne&s;s, he bade
him defend him&s;elf. The loud voice
of O&s;bert re-called Mary, and ob&s;erving
their menacing attitudes, &s;he collected
ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to throw her&s;elf
between them. Alleyn dropped his
&s;word, and rai&s;ed her from the ground;
when the Earl rudely pu&s;hed him away,
<PB N="257" REF="271">
and &s;natched her to his heart. "Hear
me, O&s;bert," was all &s;he could &s;ay.
"Declare who brought her hither,"
&s;aid the Earl &s;ternly to Alleyn. "I
know not," replied he, "you mu&s;t a&s;k
tho&s;e men whom your people have &s;e|cured.
If my life is hateful to you,
&s;trike! and &s;pare me the angui&s;h of de|fending
it again&s;t the brother of Mary."
The Earl he&s;itated in &s;urprize, and the
genero&s;ity of Alleyn called a blu&s;h into
his face. He was going to have replied,
but was interrupted by &s;ome of his
men, who had been engaged in a &s;harp
conte&s;t with the ruffians, two of whom
they had &s;ecured, and now brought
to their lord; the re&s;t were fled. In
the per&s;on of one of them, the Earl di&s;|covered
his own &s;ervant, who &s;inking in
his pre&s;ence with con&s;cious guilt, fell on
his knees imploring mercy. "Wretch,"
&s;aid the Earl, &s;eizing him, and holding
his &s;word over his head, "declare by
who&s;e authority you have acted, and all
<PB N="258" REF="272">
you know of the affair;&mdash;remember
your life depends on the truth of your
a&s;&s;ertions. "I'll tell the truth, my
lord," replied the trembling wretch,
"and nothing el&s;e, as I hope for mercy.
About three weeks ago,&mdash;no, it is not
&s;o much; about a fortnight ago, when
I was &s;ent on a me&s;&s;age to the lady Mal|colm,
the Count de Santmorin's gentle|man
&mdash;" "The Count de Sant|morin!"
re-echoed the whole company.
"But proceed," &s;aid O&s;bert. "The
Count de Santmorin's gentleman called
me into a private room, where he told
me to wait of his ma&s;ter who would
soon be there." "Be quick," &s;aid the
Earl, "proceed to facts." "I will,
my lord; the Count came, and &s;aid to
me, "Robert, I have ob&s;erved you, and
I think you can be faithful,"&mdash;he &s;aid
&s;o, my lord,&mdash;God forgive me!"
"Well&mdash;well, proceed." "Where
was I?"&mdash;"Oh!" he &s;aid, "I think you
can be faithful."&mdash;"Good God! this
<PB N="259" REF="273">
is beyond endurance; you tri&s;le, ralcal,
with my patience, to give your a&s;&s;oci|ates
time for e&s;cape; be brief, or you
die." "I will, my lord, as I hope for
life. He took from his pocket a hand|ful
of gold, which he gave me;&mdash;'can
you be &s;ecret, Robert?' &s;aid he,&mdash;yes,
my lord Count, &s;aid I, God forgive me!
&mdash;'Then ob&s;erve what I &s;ay to you.
You often attend your young lady in
her rides to Dunbayne."&mdash;"What, then
it was the Count de Santmorin, who
commi&s;&s;ioned you to undertake this
&s;cheme!" "Not me only, my lord."
"An&s;wer my que&s;tion; was the Count
the author of this plot?" "He was,
my lord." "And where is he?" &s;aid
O&s;bert, in a &s;tern voice. "I know not,
my lord." "You know not! Wretch!
remember&mdash;your life." "I know not,
as I am a living creature. He em|barked,
as you know, my lord, not far
from the ca&s;sttle of Dunbayne, and we
were travelling to a di&s;tant part of the
<PB N="260" REF="274">
coa&s;t to meet him, when we were all to
have &s;et &s;ail for Switzerland." "You
cannot be ignorant of the place of your
de&s;tination," &s;aid the Earl, turning to
the other pri&s;oner; "where is your em|ployer?"
"That is not for me to tell,"
&s;aid he, in a &s;ullen tone. "Reveal the
truth," &s;aid the Earl, "turning towards
him the point of his &s;word" "or we
will find a way to make you." "The
place where we were to meet the Count,
had no name." "You know the way
to it." "I do." "Then lead me thi|ther."
"Never!" "Never! Your life
&s;hall an&s;wer the refu&s;al," &s;aid O&s;bert,
pointing the &s;word to his brea&s;t.
"Strike!" &s;aid the Count, throwing off
the cloak which had concealed him;
"&s;trike! and rid me of a being which
pa&s;&s;ion has made hateful to me;&mdash;&s;trike!&mdash;and
make the fir&s;t moment of
my entering this place, the la&s;t of my
guilt." A faint &s;cream was uttered by
Mary; the &s;mall remains of her &s;trength
<PB N="261" REF="275">
for&s;ook her, and &s;he &s;unk on the pave|ment.
The Earl &s;tarted a few &s;teps
back, and &s;tood &s;u&s;pended in wonder.
The looks of the whole group defy
de&s;cription. "Take a &s;word," &s;aid the
Earl, recovering him&s;elf, "and defend
your life." "Never, my lord, never!
Though I have been hurried by the
force of pa&s;&s;ion, to rob you of a &s;i&s;ter,
I will not aggravate my guilt by the
murder of the brother. Your life has
already been once endangered through
my means, though not by my de&s;ign;
Heaven knows the angui&s;h which that
accident co&s;t me. The impetuo&s;ity of
pa&s;&s;ion impelled me onward with irre|&s;i&s;tible
fury; it urged me to violate the
&s;acred duties of gratitude&mdash;of friend|&s;hip
&mdash;and of humanity. To live in
&s;hame, and in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt,
is a living death. With your &s;word do
ju&s;tice to your&s;elf and virtue; and &s;pare
me the mi&s;ery of long comparing what
I am, with what I was." "Away&mdash;
<PB N="262" REF="276">
you trifle," &s;aid the Earl, "defend
your&s;elf." The Count repeated his re|fu&s;al.
"And you, villain," &s;aid O&s;bert,
turning to the man who had confe&s;&s;ed
the plot, "your pretended ignorance of
the pre&s;ence of the Count; your per|fidy
&s;hall be rewarded." "As I now
plead for mercy, my lord, I knew not
he was here." "The fellow &s;peaks
truth," &s;aid the Count, "he was igno|rant
of the place where he was to meet
me. I was approaching this &s;pot to
di&s;cover my&s;elf to the dear object of my
pa&s;&s;ion, when your people &s;urprized and
took me." Mary confirmed the te&s;ti|mony
of the Count, by declaring that
&s;he had not till that moment &s;een him
&s;ince &s;he quitted the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne.
She pleaded for his life, and al&s;o for the
&s;ervants, who had oppo&s;ed the cruelty
of their comrades. "I am no a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,"
&s;aid the Earl, "let the Count take a
&s;word, and fight me on equal terms."
&mdash;"Shall virtue be reduced to an
<PB N="263" REF="277">
equality with vice?" &s;aid the Count,
"No, my lord,&mdash;plunge your
&s;word in my heart, and expiate my
guilt." The Earl &s;till urged him to
defence; and the Count &s;till per&s;i&s;ted
in refu&s;al. Touched by the recollection
of pa&s;t friend&s;hip, and grieved that a
&s;oul like the Count's &s;hould ever be
under the dominion of vice, O&s;bert
threw down his &s;word, and overcome
with a &s;ort of tenderne&s;s&mdash;" Go, my
lord, your per&s;on is &s;afe; and if it
is nece&s;&s;ary to your peace,&mdash;&s;tretching
forth his hand,&mdash;take my forgivene&s;s."
The Count, overcome by his genero&s;ity,
and by a &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s,
&s;hrunk back: "Forbear, my lord, to
wound by your goodne&s;s, a mind alrea|dy
too &s;en&s;ible of its own deba&s;ement;
nor excite by your genero&s;ity, a remor&s;e
too keen to be endured. Your re|proaches
I can bear,&mdash;your vengeance
I &s;olicit,&mdash;but your kindne&s;s inflicts
a torture too exqui&s;ite for my &s;oul."
"Never, my Lord," continued he, the
<PB N="264" REF="278">
big tear &s;welling in his eye,&mdash;"never
more &s;hall your friend&s;hip be polluted
by my unworthine&s;s. Since you will
not &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, by taking my life, I
go to lo&s;e it in the ob&s;curity of di&s;tant
regions. Yet, ere I go, &s;uffer me to
make one la&s;t reque&s;t to you, and to that
dear lady whom I have thus injured,
and on whom my eyes now gaze for the
la&s;t time,&mdash;&s;uffer me to hope that you
will blot from your memory the exi&s;t|ence
of Santmorin." He concluded the
&s;entence with a groan, which vibrated
upon the hearts of all pre&s;ent; and
without waiting for a reply, hurried
from the &s;cene. The Earl had turned
away his head in pity, and when he
again looked round to reply, perceived
that the Count was departed; he fol|lowed
his &s;teps through the cloi&s;ter,&mdash;he
called&mdash;but he was gone.</P>
<P>Alleyn had ob&s;erved the Count with
a mixture of pity and admiration; and
<PB N="265" REF="279">
he &s;ighed for the weakne&s;s of human
nature. "How," &s;aid the Earl, return|ing
eagerly to Alleyn,&mdash;"how can I
rccompen&s;e you for my injurious &s;u&s;pi|cions,
and my injurious treatment?&mdash;How
can you forgive, or I forget my
inju&s;tice? But the my&s;tery of this affair,
and the doubtful appearance of circum|&s;tances,
mu&s;t &s;peak for me." "O!
let us talk no more of this, my lord,"
replied Alleyn, with emotion; "let us
only rejoice at the &s;afety of our dear
lady, and offer her the comfort &s;he is &s;o
much in want of." The fire was re|kindled,
and the Earl's &s;ervants laid
before him &s;ome wine, and other provi|&s;ions.
Mary, who had not ta&s;ted any
food &s;ince &s;he left the ca&s;tle, now took
&s;ome wine; it revived her, and enabled her
to take other nouri&s;hment. She en|quired,
what happy circum&s;tance had
enabled the Earl to trace her route.
"Ever &s;ince I di&s;covered your &s;light,"
&s;aid he, "I have been in pur&s;uit of you.
<PB N="266" REF="280">
Chance directed me over the&s;e wilds,
when I was driven by the &s;torm to
&s;eek &s;helter among the&s;e ruins. The
light, and an uproar of voices, drew me
to the cloi&s;ter, where, to my unutter|able
a&s;toni&s;hment, I di&s;covered you and
Alleyn: Spare me the remembrance of
what followed." Mary wi&s;hed to en|quire
what brought Alleyn to the place,
but delicacy kept her &s;ilent. O&s;bert,
however, who&s;e anxiety for his &s;i&s;ter,
had hitherto allowed him to attend only
to her, now relieved her from the pain
of lengthened &s;u&s;pen&s;e. "By what
&s;trange accident was you brought hi|ther?"
&s;aid he to Alleyn, "and what
motive has induced you &s;o long to ab|&s;ent
your&s;elf from thn ca&s;tle?" At the
la&s;t que&s;tion, Alleyn blu&s;hed, and an
involuntary &s;igh e&s;caped him. Mary
under&s;tood the blu&s;h and the &s;igh, and
awaited his reply in trembling emotion.
"I fled, my lord, from your di&s;plea|&s;ure,
and to tear my&s;elf from an object
<PB N="267" REF="281">
too dangerous, alas! for my peace. I
&s;ought to wear away in ab&s;ence, a pa&s;|&s;ion
which mu&s;t ever be hopele&s;s, but
which I now perceive, is interwoven
with my exi&s;tence.&mdash;But forgive, my
lord, the intrusion of a &s;ubject which is
painful to us all. With &s;ome money,
and a few provi&s;ions, I left my father's
cottage; and &s;ince that time, have wan|dered
over the country a forlorn and
mi&s;erable being, pa&s;&s;ing my nights in
the huts which chance threw in my way,
and de&s;igning to travel onward, and to
enli&s;t my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of my coun|try.
Night overtook me on the&s;e wa&s;tes,
and as I walked on comfortle&s;s and be|wildered,
I was alarmed by di&s;tant cries
of di&s;tre&s;s. I quickened my pace; but
the &s;ound which &s;hould have directed
my &s;teps was cea&s;ed, and a chilling
&s;ilence en&s;ued. As I &s;tood mu&s;ing, and
uncertain which cour&s;e to take, I ob|&s;erved
a feeble light break through the
gloom; I endeavoured to follow its
<PB N="268" REF="282">
rays; it led me to the&s;e ruins, who&s;e
&s;olemn appearance &s;truck with a mo|mentary
dread. A confu&s;ed murmur
of voices from within, &s;truck my ear;
as I &s;tood he&s;itating whether to enter, I
again heard tho&s;e &s;hrieks which had
alarmed me. I followed the &s;ound; it led
me to the entrance of the cloi&s;ter, at the
extremity of which I di&s;covered a party of
men engaged in fight; I drew my &s;word
and ru&s;hed forward; and the &s;en&s;ations
which I felt, on perceiving the lady
Mary, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed!" "Still,
&mdash;&s;till Heaven de&s;tines you the deliverer
of Mary!" &s;aid the Earl, gratitude
&s;welling in his eyes; "O! that I could
remove that ob&s;tacle which with-holds
you from your ju&s;t reward!" A re&s;pon|&s;ive
&s;igh &s;tole from Alleyn, and he re|mained
&s;ilent. Never was the &s;truggle
of oppo&s;ing feelings more violent, than
that which now agitated the bo&s;om of
the Earl. The worth of Alleyn aro&s;e
more con&s;picuou&s;ly bright from every
<PB N="269" REF="283">
&s;hade with which misfortune veiled it.
His noble and di&s;intere&s;ted enthu&s;ia&s;m
in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, had attached
him to the Earl, and had engaged him
in a cour&s;e of enterprizes and of dangers,
which it required valour to undertake,
and &s;kill and per&s;everance to perform;
and which had produced &s;ervices, for
which no adequate reward could be
found. He had re&s;cued the Earl from
captivity and death; and had twice pre|&s;erved
Mary in dangers. All the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
aro&s;e in &s;trong reflection to
the mind of O&s;bert; but the darkne&s;s of
prejudice and ancient pride, oppo&s;ed
their influence, and weakened their
effect.</P>
<P>The joy which Mary felt on &s;eeing
Alleyn in &s;afety, and &s;till worthy of the
e&s;teem &s;he had ever bore him, was
da&s;hed by the bitterne&s;s of reflection;
and reflection imparted a melancholy
which added to the langour of illne&s;s.
<PB N="270" REF="284">
At the dawn of day they quitted the ab|bey,
and &s;et forward on their return to
the ca&s;tle; the Earl in&s;i&s;ting upon Al|leyn's
accompanying them. On the way,
the minds of the party were variou&s;ly
and &s;ilently engaged. The Earl rumi|nated
on the conduct of Alleyn, and the
late &s;cene. Mary dwelt chiefly on the vir|tues
of her lover, and on the dangers &s;he
had e&s;caped; and Alleyn mu&s;ed on his
defeated purpo&s;es, and anticipated fu|ture
trials. The Earl's thoughts, how|ever,
were not &s;o wholly occupied, as to
prevent his que&s;tioning the &s;ervant who
had been employed by the Count, con|cerning
the further particulars of his
&s;cheme. The words of the Count, import|ing
that he had once already endangered
his life, had not e&s;caped the notice of
the Earl; though they were uttered in a
moment of too much di&s;traction to &s;uf|fer
him to demand an explanation. He
now enquired of the man, concerning
the my&s;terious &s;cene of the vaults.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="285">
"You, I &s;uppo&s;e, are not ignorant who
were the per&s;ons from whom I received
my wound." "I, my lord, had no
concern in that affair; wicked as I am,
I could not rai&s;e my hands again&s;t your
life." "But you know who did." "I
&mdash;I&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, my lord, I was after|wards
told.&mdash;But they did not mean to
hurt your lord&s;hip." "Not mean to
hurt me!&mdash;What then were their de|&s;igns,
and who were the people?"
"That accident happened long before
the Count ever &s;poke to me of his pur|po&s;e.
Indeed, my lord, I had no hand
in it; and Heaven knows how I grieved
for your lord&s;hip; and&mdash;" "Well
&mdash;well, inform me, who were the per|&s;ons
in the vaults, and what were their
de&s;ign." "I was told by a fellow &s;er|vant;
but he made me promi&s;e to be
&s;ecret; but it is proper your lord&s;hip
&s;hould know all; and I hope your
lord&s;hip will forgive me for having
li&s;tened to it.&mdash;'Robert,' &s;aid he, as
<PB N="272" REF="286">
we were talking one day of what had
happened;&mdash;'Robert,' &s;aid he, 'there
is more in this matter than you, or any
body thinks; but it is not for me to
tell all I know.' With that, I begged
he would tell me what he knew; but
he &s;till kept refu&s;ing. I promi&s;ed him
faithfully I would not tell; and &s;o at
la&s;t he told me&mdash;'Why, there is my
lord Count there, he is in love with our
young lady; and to be &s;ure as &s;weet a
lady &s;he is, as ever eyes looked upon;
but &s;he don't like him; and &s;o finding
him&s;elf refu&s;ed, he is determined to
marry her at any rate; and means &s;ome
night to get into the ca&s;tle, and carry
her off.' "What, then!&mdash;was it the
Count who wounded me?&mdash;Be quick
in your relation." "No, my lord, it
was not the Count him&s;elf&mdash;but two
of his people, whom he had &s;ent to
examine the ca&s;tle; and particularly
the windows of my young lady's apart|ment,
from whence he de&s;igned to have
<PB N="273" REF="287">
carried her, when every thing was ready
for execution. The&s;e men were let
within the walls through a way under
ground, which leads into the vaults,
by my fellow &s;ervant, as I afterwards
was told; and they e&s;caped through the
&s;ame way. Their meeting with your
lord&s;hip was accidental, and they fought
only in &s;elf-defence; for they had no
orders to attack any body." "And
who is the villain that connived at this
&s;cheme?" "It was my fellow &s;ervant,
who fled with the Count's people, whom
he him&s;elf let within the ramparts.
Forgive me, my lord; but I did not
dare tell; he threatened my life, if I
betrayed the &s;ecret."</P>
<P>After a journey of fatigue, and un|plea&s;ant
reflections, they arrived on the
&s;econd morning at the ca&s;tle of Athlin.
The Counte&s;s, during the ab&s;ence of her
&s;on, had endured a &s;tate of dreadful
&s;u&s;pen&s;e The Barone&s;s, in her friend|ship,
<PB N="274" REF="288">
had endeavoured to &s;oothe her
di&s;tre&s;s, by her con&s;tant pre&s;ence; &s;he
was engaged in this amiable office,
when the trampling of hor&s;es in the
court, reached the ears of Matilda.
"It is my &s;on," &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing from
her chair;&mdash;"it is my &s;on; he brings
me life or death!" She &s;aid no more,
but ru&s;hed into the hall, and in a mo|ment
after cla&s;ped her almo&s;t expiring
daughter to her bo&s;om. The tran&s;port
of the &s;cene repelled utterrance; &s;obs
and tears were all that could be given.
The general joy, however, was &s;uddenly
interrupted by the Barone&s;s, who had
followed Matilda into the hall; and
who now fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground;
delight yielded to &s;urprize, and to the
bu&s;ine&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the object of it. On
recovering, the Barone&s;s looked wildly
round her;&mdash;"Was it a vi&s;ion that I
&s;aw, or a reality?" The whole com|pany
moved their eyes round the hall,
but could di&s;cover nothing extraordi|nary.
<PB N="275" REF="289">
"It was him&s;elf; his very air,
his features; that benign countenance
which I have &s;o often contemplated in
imagination!" Her eyes &s;tiil &s;eemed
in &s;earch of &s;ome ideal object; and
they began to doubt whether a &s;udden
phrenzy had not &s;eized her brain.
"Ah! again! &s;aid &s;he, and in&s;tantly
relap&s;ed. Their eyes were now turned
towards the door, on which &s;he had
gazed; it was Alleyn who entered, with
water which he had fetched for the
Counte&s;s, and on whom the attention
of all pre&s;ent was now centered. He
approached, ignorant of what had hap|pened;
and his &s;urprize was great,
when the Barone&s;s reviving, fixed her
eyes mournfully upon him, and a&s;ked
him to uncover his arm.&mdash;"It is,&mdash;it
is my Philip!" &s;aid &s;he, with &s;trong
emotion; I have, indeed, found my
long lo&s;t child; that &s;trawberry on his
arm, confirms the deci&s;ion. Send for
the man who calls him&s;elf your father,
<PB N="276" REF="290">
and for my &s;ervant Patrick." The &s;en|&s;ations
of the mother and the &s;on may
be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed;
tho&s;e of Mary were little inferior to
theirs; and the whole company awaited
with trembling eagerne&s;s the arrival of
the two per&s;ons who&s;e te&s;timony was
to decide this intere&s;ting affair. They
came. "This young man you call
your &s;on?" &s;aid the Barone&s;s. "I do,
an' plea&s;e your lady&s;hip," he replied,
with a degree of confu&s;ion which belied
his words. When Patrick came, his
in&s;tant &s;urprize on &s;eeing the old man,
declared the truth. "Do you know
this per&s;on?" &s;aid the Barone&s;s to
Patrick. "Yes, my lady, I know him
too well; it was to him I gave your
in&s;ant &s;on." The old man &s;tarted with
&s;urprize&mdash;"Is that youth the &s;on of
your lady&s;hip?" "Yes!" "Then
God forgive me for having thus long
detained him from you! but I was ig|norant
of his birth, and received him
<PB N="277" REF="291">
into my cottage as a foundling, &s;uc|coured
by lord Malcolm's compa&s;&s;ion."
The whole company crowded round
them. Alleyn fell at the feet of his
mother, and bathed her hand with his
tears.&mdash;"Gracious God! for what ha&s;t
thou re&s;erved me!" He could &s;ay no
more. The Barone&s;s rai&s;ed him, and
again pre&s;&s;ed him in tran&s;port to her
heart. It was &s;ome time before either
of them could &s;peak; and all pre&s;ent
were too much affected to interrupt the
&s;ilence. At length, the Barone&s;s pre|&s;ented
Laura to her brother. "Such a
mother! and have I &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter!"
&s;aid he. Laura wept &s;ilently upon his
neck the joy of her heart. The Earl
was the fir&s;t who recovered compo&s;ure
&s;ufficient to congratulate Alleyn; and
embracing him&mdash;O! happy moment,
when I can indeed embrace you as my
brother! The whole company now
poured forth their joy and their con|gratulations;&mdash;all
but Mary, who&s;e
<PB N="278" REF="292">
emotions almo&s;t overcame her, and were
too powerful for utterance.</P>
<P>The company now adjourned to the
drawing-room; and Mary withdrew to
take that repo&s;e &s;he &s;o much required.
She was &s;ufficiently recovered in a few
hours to join her friends in the ban|quetting-room.</P>
<P>After the tran&s;ports of the &s;cene were
&s;ub&s;ided&mdash;"I have yet much to hope,
and much to fear," &s;aid Philip Mal|colm,
who was yet Alleyn in every
thing but in name. "You, madam,"
addre&s;&s;ing the Barone&s;s,&mdash;"you will
willingly become my advocate with her
whom I have &s;o long and &s;o ardently
loved." "May I hope," continued he,
taking tenderly the hand of Mary, who
&s;tood trembling by,&mdash;"that you have
not been in&s;en&s;ible to my long attach|ment,
and that you will confirm the
happine&s;s which is now offered me?"

A &s;mile of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s broke
through the melancholy which had long
clouded her features, and which even
the pre&s;ent di&s;covery had not been able
entirely to di&s;&s;ipate, and her eye gave
the con&s;ent which her tongue refu&s;ed to
utter.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, for the remainder
of the day, was occupied by the &s;ubject
of the di&s;covery, and with a recital of
Mary's adventure. It was determined,
that on the morrow the marriage of the
Earl &s;hould be concluded.</P>
<P>On this happy di&s;covery, the Earl
ordered the gates of the ca&s;tle to be
thrown open; mirth and fe&s;tivity re|&s;ounded
through the walls, and the
evening clo&s;ed in univer&s;al rejoicings.</P>
<P>On the following morn, the chapel
of the ca&s;tle was decorated for the mar|riage
of the Earl; who, with Laura,
came attended by Philip, now Baron
Malcolm, by Mary, and the whole fa|mily.
When they approached the al|tar,
the Earl addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his
<PB N="280" REF="294">
bride,&mdash;"Now, my Laura," &s;aid he,
"we may celebrate tho&s;e nuptials which
have twice been &s;o painfully interrupt|ed,
and which are to crown me with
felicity. This day &s;hall unite our fami|lies
in a double marriage, and reward
the worth of my friend. It is now &s;een,
that tho&s;e virtues which &s;timulated him
to pro&s;ecute for another the cau&s;e of
ju&s;tice, my&s;teriou&s;ly urged him to
the recovery of his rights. Virtue may
for a time be pur&s;ued by misfortune,&mdash;and
ju&s;tice be ob&s;cured by the tran&s;ient
triumphs of vice,&mdash;but the power who&s;e
peculiar attributes they are, clears away
the clouds of error, and even in this world
e&s;tabli&s;hes his THRONE OF JUSTICE."</P>
<P>The Earl &s;tepped forward, and join|ing
the hands of Philip and Mary,&mdash;"Surely,
&s;aid he, this is a moment of
perfect happine&s;s!&mdash;I can now reward
tho&s;e virtues which I have ever loved;
and tho&s;e &s;ervices to which every gift
mu&s;t be inadequate, but this I now
be&s;tow.</P>
