<P>WHEN we undertake to clear up the hi&s;|tory of an animal, our fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is to examine, with a critical eye, the various names which it has received in different lan|guages, and at different times; and to endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;everal &s;pe|cies to which the&s;e have been applied. This is the only way of reaping benefit from the know|ledge acquired by the ancients, and of con|necting it u&s;efully with the di&s;coveries of the moderns; and con&s;equently, the only way of
<PB N="2" REF="9">
making real progre&s;s in Natural Hi&s;tory. For how could, I &s;hall not &s;ay one man, but a whole generation, or even a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, complete the hi&s;tory of a &s;ingle animal? Al|mo&s;t all animals fear man and fly from him. The character of &s;upremacy, which the Mo&s;t High has &s;tamped on his brow, in&s;pires them with terror rather than re&s;pect. They &s;hrink from his eye; they &s;u&s;pect his &s;nares, and they dread his arms. Even tho&s;e that are able to defend them&s;elves by their &s;trength, or re&s;i&s;t an attack by their bulk, retire in|to de&s;erts for which we di&s;dain to contend, or entrench in the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of impenetrable fore&s;ts. The &s;mall animals, &s;ecure in e&s;caping our vigilance by their diminutive &s;ize, and em|boldened by their weakne&s;s it&s;elf, live in the mid&s;t of us, in &s;pite of our endeavours to extir|pate them, feed at our expence, and &s;ometimes even prey on our own &s;ub&s;tance, though not on that account better known. Among the great number of intermediate cla&s;&s;es included between the&s;e two extremes, &s;ome dig for them&s;elves &s;ubterraneous retreats, &s;ome plunge into the depths of the ocean, others di&s;appear in the a&euml;rial expan&s;e, but all of them fly from the tyrant of Nature. How then is it po&s;&s;ible, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time to view all the animals in all the &s;ituations nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;covering com|pletely their in&s;tincts, their di&s;po&s;itions, their habits, and in a word, the principal facts of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
their hi&s;tory. It is well to collect at great ex|pence numerous &s;eries of the&s;e animals, to pre|&s;erve carefully their external coat, to add their &s;keletons artfully combined, to give each indi|vidual its proper attitude and native air, but all this only repre&s;ents the &s;urface of nature dead and inanimate. If &s;ome monarch would adopt the truly grand idea, of contributing to the ad|vancement of this beautiful part of &s;cience, by forming va&s;t collections, and a&s;&s;embling, under the eyes of ob&s;ervers, a great number of living &s;pecies, we &s;hould &s;till acquire but imperfect ideas. Mo&s;t animals, intimidated by the pre|&s;ence of man, tea&s;ed with his ob&s;ervations, and further tormented by the unea&s;ine&s;s in&s;eparable from captivity, would exhibit manners that are altered, con&s;trained, and hardly worthy the at|tention of a philo&s;opher, who admires Nature only when free, independent, or even wild.</P>
<P>To &s;tudy animals with accuracy then, we ought to ob&s;erve them in the &s;avage &s;tate, to ac|company them into the retreats which they have cho&s;en for them&s;elves, to follow them into the deep caverns, to attend them on the frightful precipices, where they enjoy unbounded liberty. Nor &s;hould we be perceived by them while we contemplate their habits; for the eye of an ob&s;erver, if not concealed from their view, would, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, di&s;concert their motions. But there are few animals, e&s;pecially of the winged tribe, that
<PB N="4" REF="11">
can be thus &s;urveyed: it requires a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, and innumerable fortunate occurrences, to a&s;certain all the nece&s;&s;ary facts; and it needs the clo&s;e&s;t attention to refer each ob&s;ervation to its proper &s;ubject, and con&s;equently to avoid the confu&s;ion of names. Without the&s;e precautions the mo&s;t profound ignorance &s;hould be preferred to a pretended &s;cience, which at bottom is but a web of uncertainty and error. The Great Bu&s;|tard is a &s;triking in&s;tance. The Greeks named it <HI>Otis</HI>; and Ari&s;totle mentions it by this name in three places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. ii. 17.; lib. v. 6.; lib. ix. 33.</BIBL></NOTE>; and his de&s;cription perfectly agrees with our Great Bu&s;tard. But the Latins, deceived probably by the re&s;emblance of the words, confounded it with <HI>otus,</HI> which is a noc|turnal bird. Pliny, after properly &s;aying that the bird named <HI>otis</HI> by the Greeks, is called <HI>avis tarda</HI> in Spain, which character applies to the Great Bu&s;tard, &s;ubjoins, that its fle&s;h has a rank ta&s;te<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pliny's words are: <Q REND="inline">Proximae eis &s;unt, quas Hi&s;pania aves tardas appellat, Graecia otidas, damnatas cibis. Emi&s;&s;a enim o&s;&s;ibus medulla, odoris taedium &s;equitur.</Q> Next to the&s;e (he was &s;peaking of the black grous) we may rank what are termed in Spain the <HI>&s;low birds,</HI> and in Greece, the <HI>otides,</HI> which are re|jected as food; for as &s;oon as the marrow is detached from the bones, a loath&s;ome &s;mell is exhaled. <BIBL>Lib. x. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>, which agrees with the <HI>otus,</HI> ac|cording to Ari&s;totle and
to fact, but has no reference to the Great Bu&s;tard; and this mi&s;|take can
be the more ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ince <PB N="5" REF="12"> Pliny, in the
following chapter, evidently con|founds the <HI>otis</HI> with the
<HI>otus</HI>; that is, the Great Bu&s;tard with the Eared Owl.</P>
<P>Alexander the Myndian, as quoted by Athe|naeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>, falls into the &s;ame error, a&s;cribing to the <HI>otus</HI> or <HI>otis,</HI> which he takes for the &s;ame individual bird, the circum&s;tance of having hairy feet; which is true of the <HI>otus,</HI> or eared owl; in which, as in mo&s;t of the nocturnal birds, the legs and feet are covered with hair, or rather clothed to the nails with feathers, that are parted into threads; and not to the <HI>otis,</HI> which is our Great Bu&s;tard; and in which, not only the foot, but the lower part of the leg, immediately over the tar&s;us, is quite bare.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mundus Gelenius, having found in He&s;y|chius the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, the meaning of which was not a&s;certained, has be&s;towed it, from mere fancy, on the Great Bu&s;tard<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Lexico Symphono.</NOTE>; and &s;ince his time, Maehring and Bri&s;&s;on have, without a&s;&s;igning their rea&s;ons, applied it to the Dodo.</P>
<P>The modern Jews have arbitrarily taken the Hebrew word <HI>anapha,</HI> which denoted a kind of kite, to &s;ignify the Great Bu&s;tard<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Paul Faugius, <HI>apud Ge&s;nerum.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on gives the word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> for the Greek name of the Great Bu&s;tard, according to Belon; but afterwards adopts <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from Aldrovandus. He does not advert that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is the accu&s;ative
<PB N="6" REF="13">
of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and con&s;equently is the &s;ame individual name. It is ju&s;t as if he had &s;aid, that &s;ome call it <HI>tarda,</HI> and others <HI>tardam.</HI></P>
<P>Schwenckfeld pretends that the <HI>tetrix,</HI> noticed by Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. vi. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>, and which was the <HI>ourax</HI> of the Athenians, is al&s;o our Great Bu&s;tard. But what little Ari&s;totle mentions with re&s;pect to the <HI>te|trix,</HI> does not apply to the Great Bu&s;tard. The <HI>tetrix</HI> builds its ne&s;t among low plants, and the Great Bu&s;tard among growing corn; which Ari&s;totle probably did not mean to include in the general expre&s;&s;ion, "low plants." Secondly, This great philo&s;opher explains him&s;elf in this manner: <Q REND="inline">The birds which fly little, as the partridges and quails, do not con&s;truct ne&s;ts, but lay their eggs on the ground, on &s;mall heaps of leaves which they gather; the lark and <HI>tetrix</HI> do the &s;ame.</Q> The lea&s;t attention to this pa&s;&s;age will convince us, that it alludes to tho&s;e tardy birds which fly little; and that the lark and <HI>tetrix</HI> are mentioned, becau&s;e they ne&s;tle on the ground like the&s;e, though apparently more agile, &s;ince the lark is of the number. If Ari&s;totle had meant our Great Bu&s;tard by the name <HI>tetrix,</HI> he would certainly have ranged it as a &s;luggi&s;h bird with the partridges and quails, and not with the larks, which, from their lofty flight, have merited, according to Schwenckfeld him&s;elf, the epithet of <HI>coelipetes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14">
Longolius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dialog. de Avibus.</BIBL></NOTE> and Ge&s;ner<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Avibus, lib. iii.</BIBL></NOTE> are both of opi|nion, that the <HI>tetrax</HI> of the poet Neme&s;ianus is nothing but the Great Bu&s;tard; and it mu&s;t be allowed that the&s;e nearly re&s;emble each other in &s;ize<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>" Tarpeiae e&s;t cu&s;tos arcis non corpore major.&mdash;</L></Q>The &s;entinel of the Tarpeian rock (the goo&s;e) is not larger.</NOTE> and in plumage<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>" Per&s;imiles cineri dor&s;um maculo&s;aque terga</L>

the &s;pe|cies; and the le&s;s &s;o, as I find, by comparing what Neme&s;ianus
relates of his <HI>tetrax,</HI> with what we know of our Great Bu&s;tard, two
di&s;|tinct differences: 1. The <HI>tetrax</HI> appears tame from &s;tupidity,
and heedle&s;sly falls into the very &s;nare which has been laid for it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q> 
<L>" Cum pedicas necti &s;ibi contemplaverit ad&s;tans</L>
<L>" Immemor ip&s;e &s;ui tamen in di&s;pendia currit.</L></Q></NOTE>; but the Great Bu&s;tard is intimidated at the approach of man, and
quickly flies out of his view<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Neque hominem ad &s;e appropinquantem &s;u&s;tinent, &s;ed cum eum longinquo cernunt &s;tatim fugam cape&s;&s;unt.</Q> <BIBL>WILLOUGHBY.</BIBL> </NOTE>. 2. The <HI>tetrax</HI> built its ne&s;t at the foot of the
Apennines; whereas Aldrovandus, who was an Italian, a&s;&s;ures us
po&s;itively, that the Great Bu&s;|tards are never &s;een in Italy, except when
they are driven thither by a gu&s;t of wind<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Italia no&s;tra has aves ni&s;i forte ventorum turbine advectas non habet.</Q> <BIBL>ALDROV. tom. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is <PB N="8" REF="15"> true, indeed, that Willoughby
&s;u&s;pects they are not rare in that country; becau&s;e, when he pa&s;&s;ed
through Modena, he &s;aw one in the mar|ket. But I &s;hould conceive that a
&s;ingle Great Bu&s;tard brought to market in &s;uch a city as Mo|dena, agrees
better with the a&s;&s;ertion of Aldro|vandus than with the conjecture of
Willoughby.</P>
<P>Perrault imputes to Ari&s;totle the &s;tory that the <HI>otis</HI> of Scythia does not &s;it on its eggs like other birds, but covers them with a hare's or fox's &s;kin, concealing them at the root of a tree, on who&s;e top it is perched. Yet Ari&s;totle does not apply this at all to the Great Bu&s;tard, but only to a certain Scythian bird, probably a bird of prey, which could tear off the &s;kins of hares and foxes, and which was only of the &s;ize of a Bu&s;tard, as Pliny and Gaza<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Scythis avis magnitudine <HI>otidis</HI> binos parit, in leporina pelle &s;emper in cacuminibus ramorum &s;u&s;pen&s;a. <BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Nat.</HI> lib. x. 33.</BIBL></NOTE> tran&s;late it; be&s;ides, however little Ari&s;totle was
acquainted with the Bu&s;tard, he could not fail to know that it never
perches.</P>
<P>The compounded name <HI>trapp-gantz,</HI> which the Germans have be&s;towed on this bird, has given ri&s;e to other mi&s;takes. <HI>Trappen</HI> &s;ignifies to walk; and cu&s;tom has connected to its derivatives the acce&s;&s;ory idea of tardine&s;s, in the &s;ame manner as in the ca&s;e of the Latin word <HI>gradatim</HI> and the Italian <HI>andante</HI>; and hence the epithet <HI>trapp</HI> can, with propriety, be applied to the Bu&s;tard, which, when not pur&s;ued, walks &s;low|ly

and heavily. The application would &s;till be ju&s;t, though we did not affix the notion of &s;lug|gi&s;hne&s;s; &s;ince to de&s;cribe a bird with the habit of walking, contains an implication that it &s;eldom flies.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the word <HI>gantz,</HI> it may admit of a double acceptation. Here it ought perhaps to be written, as I have done, with a final <HI>z</HI>; and then it &s;ignifies <HI>much,</HI> and marks the &s;uper|lative: but if it be written <HI>gans</HI> with an <HI>s,</HI> it means a <HI>goo&s;e.</HI> Some authors, taking the word in the la&s;t &s;en&s;e, have tran&s;lated it by the Latin <HI>an&s;er trappus,</HI> and mi&s;led by this interpretation, have alleged that the Great Bu&s;tard is an aqua|tic bird which delights in mar&s;hes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sylvaticus <HI>apud Ge&s;nerum.</HI></NOTE>. Aldro|vandus him&s;elf, though informed by a Dutch phy|&s;ician of the ambiguity of the word, and though inclined to give it the &s;ame meaning that I do, has yet made Belon &s;ay, in his Latin tran&s;lation of the pa&s;&s;age, that the Great Bu&s;tard is fond of wet &s;ituations; and yet that naturali&s;t affirms di|rectly the contrary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The nature of the Bu&s;tard is to live in &s;pacious plains, like the o&s;trich, avoiding water above all things.

<P>Belon pretends that the <HI>tetras alter</HI> of Pliny<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. x. 22.</BIBL></NOTE> was the Great Bu&s;tard; but there is no founda|tion for this opinion, &s;ince Pliny mentions the

<HI>avis tarda</HI> in the &s;ame place.

But he ought to have prov|ed: 1. That the Great Bu&s;tard inhabits lofty moun|tains, as Pliny affirms of the <HI>tetras alter, (gignunt eos Alpes,)</HI> which contradicts the a&s;&s;ertions of all the naturali&s;ts with re&s;pect to this bird, ex|cept Barrere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barrere admits two &s;orts of Bu&s;tards in Europe; but he is the only per&s;on that has repre&s;ented them as inhabitants of the Pyrennees.

That the owl, and not the Great Bu&s;tard, has really been known in Spain by the name of <HI>avis tarda,</HI> and in Greek by that of <HI>otis</HI>; but this is totally inadmi&s;&s;ible, as it is contrary to the te&s;timony of almo&s;t all writers. What may have deceived Belon is, that Pliny mentions his &s;econd <HI>tetras</HI> as one of the large&s;t birds after the o&s;trich, which, according to Be|lon, is true only of the Great Bu&s;tard. But we &s;hall find in the &s;equel, that the wood grous &s;ome|times exceeds in bulk the Great Bu&s;tard; and &s;ince Pliny &s;ubjoins, that the fle&s;h of this <HI>avis tarda</HI> has a rank ta&s;te, which corre&s;ponds much better with the <HI>otus,</HI> the long-eared owl, than with the <HI>otis,</HI> the Great Bu&s;tard, Belon &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected that the naturali&s;t confounds here the <HI>otis</HI> with the <HI>otus,</HI> as I have before remarked; and that he a&s;cribes to the &s;ame &s;pecies the qua|lities of two &s;pecies widely different from each

other, though expre&s;&s;ed in his compilation by nearly &s;imilar names; but he was not entitled to conclude that the <HI>avis tarda</HI> was really the long-eared owl.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Belon would believe, that his <HI>aedic|nemus</HI> was an <HI>o&s;tardeau,</HI> or <HI>&s;tone-curlew</HI>; and in|deed this bird has only three toes, all of them an|terior, like the Great Bu&s;tard; but its bill is widely different, the tar&s;us thicker, the neck &s;horter, and it &s;eems to have more analogy to the plover than to the Great Bu&s;tard.

<P>From the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions we may conclude, that the <HI>otis</HI> of the Greeks, and not <HI>otus,</HI> is our Great Bu&s;tard; that the name <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> has been applied to it from inattention, as it has afterwards been to the dodo; that that of <HI>anapha,</HI> given by the modern Jews, belonged formerly to the kite; that the <HI>avis tarda</HI> of Pliny, or rather of the Spaniards in the time of Pliny, was &s;o called on account of its &s;lowne&s;s, and not as Nyphus would have it, becau&s;e it was late before it was known at Rome <HI>(tardus)</HI>; that it is neither the <HI>tetrix</HI> of Ari&s;totle, nor the <HI>tetrax</HI> of the poet Neme|&s;ianus, nor the Scythian bird mentioned by

<P>To perceive the importance of this inve&s;tiga|tion, we need only figure in our imaginations the &s;trange and ridiculous idea which a beginner would form of the Great Bu&s;tard, who had col|lected indi&s;criminately and with blind confidence all that has been a&s;cribed to this bird by authors, or rather to the different names by which it is
<PB N="14" REF="21">
di&s;tingui&s;hed in their works: at one time a diur|nal bird, at another a nocturnal; &s;ometimes an inhabitant of the mountains, at other times an inhabitant of the plains; &s;ometimes a native of Europe, at other times a native of America; now a land bird, then an aquatic one; &s;ome|times granivorous, at other times carnivorous; &s;ometimes extremely large, at other times very &s;mall: in a word, a mon&s;ter and a chimaera. But, to di&s;criminate the true qualities, it is nece&s;&s;ary, as we have done, to draw a critical compari&s;on between the de&s;criptions of former naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>But we have dwelt long enough on words; it is now time to proceed to things. Ge&s;ner exults in being the fir&s;t who perceived that the Great Bu&s;tard might be referred to the gallinaceous cla&s;s. It is true indeed, that it re&s;embles this cla&s;s in its bill and its weight; but it differs in its thick|ne&s;s; in its legs, which have three toes; in the &s;hape of its tail; in the lower part of its legs be|ing naked; in the great aperture of its ears; in the beards of feathers which hang under its chin, in place of tho&s;e fle&s;hy membranes with which the gallinaceous tribes are furni&s;hed; not to men|tion the difference of the internal &s;tructure.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus is not more fortunate in his con|jectures, when he takes the frugivorous eagle, mentioned by Aelian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. x. According to Aelian, this eagle was called the <HI>Eagle of Jupiter.</HI> It was &s;till more a frugivorous bird than the Bu&s;tard, which eats earth-worms; for the eagle de&s;troyed no living creature.</NOTE>, for a Bu&s;tard, becau&s;e of
<PB N="15" REF="22">
its &s;ize: as if the attribute of magnitude were alone &s;ufficient to con&s;titute the idea of an eagle. It appears to me much more probable, that Aelian+meant the great vulture, which is a bird of prey, as well as the eagle, and even &s;tronger than the common eagle, and which feeds on grain in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. I opened one of the&s;e birds which had been wounded by a &s;hot, and which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days in fields of growing corn, and I found nothing in the &s;tomach but a green liquor, which was evidently half-dige&s;ted herb|age.</P>
<P>We can more ea&s;ily trace the characters of the Great Bu&s;tard in the <HI>tetrax</HI> of Athenaeus, which is larger than the bigge&s;t cocks, (and we know that &s;ome of the&s;e are of a prodigious &s;ize in A&s;ia,) has only three toes on the feet, has beards hang|ing on each &s;ide of the bill, a mailed plumage, a deep cry, and who&s;e fle&s;h has the ta&s;te like that of the o&s;trich, which re&s;embles the Great Bu&s;tard in many other re&s;pects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Otis avis fidipes e&s;t, tribus in&s;i&s;tens digitis, magnitudine gallinacei majoris, capite oblongo, oculis amplis, ro&s;tro acuto, lingu&acirc; o&s;&s;e&acirc;, gracili collo.</Q> <BIBL>GESNER. </BIBL></NOTE>. But this <HI>tetrax</HI> can|not be the Great Bu&s;tard, &s;ince,
according to Athenaeus, it is a bird nowhere mentioned in the writings of
Ari&s;totle; whereas this philo&s;opher &s;peaks of the Great Bu&s;tard in
&s;everal places.</P>
<P>We might al&s;o &s;u&s;pect with Perrault, that tho&s;e partridges of India mentioned by Strabo as equal to the goo&s;e in &s;ize, are a &s;pecies of Bu&s;tards.
<PB N="16" REF="23">
The male is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the female by the colours of its plumage, which are differently di&s;tributed and more vivid; by tho&s;e beards of feathers which hang from both &s;ides of the neck, which it is &s;urpri&s;ing that Perrault has not men|tioned, and with which Albin has improperly ornamented the figure of the male; by its &s;ize, which is almo&s;t double that of the female, a greater di&s;proportion than has been remarked in any other &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Belon, and &s;ome others who were not acquaint|ed with the ca&s;&s;owary, the touyon, the dodo, or perhaps the great vulture, con&s;idered the Great Bu&s;tard as a bird of the &s;econd magnitude, and as the large&s;t next to the o&s;trich. But the peli|lican, which was not known to them, is much larger, according to Perrault. Perhaps, however, Belon only &s;aw a large Bu&s;tard and a &s;mall pelican; and in that ca&s;e, his mi&s;take will be the &s;ame with that of many others, the a&s;&s;erting with re&s;pect to &s;pecies, what is true but of an indi|vidual.</P>
<P>Edwards accu&s;es Willoughby of being gro&s;sly deceived, and of drawing Albin, who copied him, into the &s;ame error, in a&s;&s;erting that the Great Bu&s;tard is &s;ixty inches in length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail. In fact, tho&s;e which I have mea&s;ured were only three feet and a half; and &s;uch was that of Bri&s;&s;on. The one examined by Edwards, was three feet and a half long, or three feet nine inches from the point
<PB N="17" REF="24">
of the bill to the extremity of the tail. In the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology,</HI> it is &s;tated at four Engli&s;h feet. The expan&s;ion of the wings varies more than one half in different &s;ubjects. It is reckoned &s;even feet four inches by Edwards, nine feet by the authors of the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology,</HI> and four French feet by Perrault, who declares that he never ex|amined the males, which are always larger than the females.</P>
<P>The weight of this bird admits of con&s;iderable variations; &s;ome are only ten pounds, others twenty-&s;even or even thirty. But it al&s;o varies in its proportions; and the individuals of the &s;pecies &s;eem not all formed after the &s;ame model. Per|rault ob&s;erved &s;ome who&s;e neck was longer, and others where it was &s;horter, than the legs; &s;ome who&s;e bill was more pointed, others who&s;e ears were &s;haded with longer feathers; and all of them had a much longer neck and legs than tho&s;e examined by Ge&s;ner and Aldrovandus. In the &s;ubjects de&s;cribed by Edwards, there were on each &s;ide of the neck two naked &s;pots, of a violet colour, but which appeared covered with fea|thers, when the neck was much extended; a circum&s;tance that has been remarked by no other ob&s;ervers. Finally, Klein mentions that the Great Bu&s;tards in Poland are not exactly like to tho&s;e in France and in England; and indeed we find, by comparing the de&s;criptions, &s;ome dif|ferences in the colours of the plumage, in the bill, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25">
In general, the Great Bu&s;tard is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the o&s;trich, the ca&s;&s;owary, the touyon, and the dodo, by the circum&s;tance, that its wings, though little proportioned to its ma&s;s, are yet able to rai&s;e it from the ground, and &s;upport it for &s;ome time in the air; whereas the&s;e four birds are totally incapable of flying. It is al&s;o di&s;criminated from all the others by its &s;ize; its feet, which are furni&s;hed with three toes, that are parted and without membranes; its bill re|fembling that of the dodo; its ro&s;e-coloured down, and the nakedne&s;s of the lower part of the feet; not indeed by any one of the&s;e cha|racters, but by the conjunction of them all.</P>
<P>The wing con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;ix quills, ac|cording to Bri&s;&s;on; and of thirty-two or thirty|three, according to Edwards, who perhaps in|cludes tho&s;e of the fal&s;e wing. The only thing I have to remark on the&s;e quills, and which can hardly be perceived from the in&s;pecting of the figure, is that, at the third, fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth feathers of each wing, the exterior webs become at once &s;horter, and con&s;equently the&s;e quills are narrower, where they project from un|der the coverts.</P>
<P>The quills of the tail amount to twenty, and the two middle ones differ from all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Perrault<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour &s;ervir a l'Hi&s;toire des Animaux.</BIBL></NOTE> imputes to Belon the a&s;&s;erting that the upper part of the wings of the Great Bu&s;tard
<PB N="19" REF="26">
is white, contrary to the ob&s;ervations of the aca|demicians, and to what is commonly remarked in the&s;e birds, in which there is more white on the belly and the under part of the body, and more brown and other colours on the back and wings. But I am inclined to think, that Belon may be ea&s;ily ju&s;tified on this head; for he &s;ays exactly what the academicians do, that <HI>the Great Bu&s;tard is white under the belly and below the wings</HI>; and when he de&s;cribes the upper part of the wings as black, he undoubtedly means tho&s;e quills of the wing which are next the body, and which are really over the wing when it is clo&s;ed and the bird in an erect po&s;ture. But in this &s;en&s;e the a&s;&s;ertion is true, and conformable to the de&s;cription of Edwards, where the twenty|&s;ixth quill, and tho&s;e that follow, inclu&s;ive to the thirtieth, are perfectly white.</P>
<P>Perrault has made a more accurate ob&s;ervation. It is, that &s;ome feathers of the Great Bu&s;tard are covered with down, not only at their ba&s;e, but even at their extremity; &s;o that the middle of the feather, which con&s;i&s;ts of clo&s;e connected webs, is &s;ituated between two parts, where there is no down. But what is very remarkable, the down at the origin of all the&s;e feathers, except the quills at the end of the wing, is of a bright red, approaching to ro&s;e colour, which is a character common to the Great and the Small Bu&s;tard. The end of the quill is al&s;o of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27">
The foot, or rather the <HI>tar&s;us,</HI> and the lower part of the foot, which articulates with the tar|&s;us, are covered with very &s;mall &s;cales, tho&s;e of the toes being long narrow tablets; they are all of a grey colour, and &s;heathed with a cuticle, which it ca&s;ts like the &s;lough of a &s;erpent.</P>
<P>The nails are &s;hort and convex, both above and below, like tho&s;e of the eagle, termed <HI>Ha|liaetos</HI> by Belon; &s;o that a &s;ection perpendicular to their axis, would be nearly circular.</P>
<P>Salerne was mi&s;taken, in a&s;&s;erting, that the Great Bu&s;tard, on the contrary, had nails con|cave below.</P>
<P>Under the feet, we can perceive behind a callous prominence, which &s;erves in&s;tead of a heel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon and Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The brea&s;t is thick and round<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; the width of the aperture of the ears is probably &s;ubject to variations; for Belon found, that it was larger in the Great Bu&s;tard than in any other land bird<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">One may ea&s;ily put the tip of the finger in the pa&s;&s;age.</Q> <BIBL>BELON.</BIBL></NOTE>, while the academicians could perceive nothing unu&s;ual.

apertures are concealed under the feathers; and internally we di&s;cover two

<P>The Great Bu&s;tard is a granivorous bird; it lives on herbs, grain, and every kind of &s;eed; on the leaves of coleworts, of dandelions, of turnips, of mou&s;e-ear, of vetches, of &s;mallage, of carrots, and even on hay, and on tho&s;e large worms which, during the &s;ummer, &s;warm be|fore &s;un-ri&s;e on downs. In the depth of winter, and when the ground is covered with &s;now, they feed on the bark of trees; and at all times, they &s;wallow &s;mall &s;tones, or even bits of metal, like the o&s;trich. The academicians, on open|ing the &s;tomach of one of the Great Bu&s;tards which they ob&s;erved, found it filled partly with &s;tones, &s;ome of which were of the &s;ize of a nut, and partly with <HI>doubloons,</HI> to the number of ninety, all worn and poli&s;hed where they were expo&s;ed to the attrition, but without the lea&s;t appearance of ero&s;ion.</P>
<P>Willoughby found in the &s;tomach of the&s;e birds, which were killed in the harve&s;t &s;ea&s;on,

<P>The liver is very large; the gall-bladder, the pancreas, the number of pancreatic ducts, their in&s;ertion, and that of the hepatic and cy&s;tic ducts, are liable to &s;ome variation in different &s;ubjects.</P>

This bird does not build any ne&s;t, but only &s;crapes a hole in the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, and drops into it two eggs, which it hatches for thirty days, as u&s;ual with large birds, according to Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t.

But this a&s;&s;ertion agrees neither with the general opinion of naturali&s;ts, nor with the in&s;tinct of the Great Bu&s;tard, which, as it is wild and timid, mu&s;t &s;eek for &s;afety rather by concealing it&s;elf in tall corn, than by over-topping it, in or|der to ob&s;erve the &s;port&s;men at a di&s;tance, and incur the danger of being it&s;elf di&s;covered.</P>

authors, is a bird of pa&s;&s;age, it would &s;eem that it has never migrated
into America by the north; for though the accounts of travellers are filled
with Bu&s;tards found in the New Continent, it is ea&s;y to perceive that
the&s;e pretended Bu&s;tards are aquatic birds, as I have before remarked, and
entirely dif|ferent from that which we at pre&s;ent con&s;ider. Barrere
mentions, indeed, in his E&s;&s;ay on Ornithology, a cinereous Bu&s;tard of
America, which he &s;ays he ob&s;erved; but in the fir&s;t place, it does not
appear that he had &s;een it in America, &s;ince he takes no notice of it in
his ac|count of Equinoctial France; in the &s;econd place, he is the only one,
except Klein, who &s;peaks of an American Bu&s;tard; and that of Klein, the 
<PB N="32" REF="39"> <HI>macucagua</HI> of Marcgrave, has not the characters
that belong to the genus, &s;ince there are four toes on each foot, and the
lower part of the leg is feathered to its articulation with the
<HI>tar&s;us</HI>; it wants the tail, and bears &s;carcely any relation to the
Great Bu&s;tard, unle&s;s that it is heavy, and never flies or perches. With
re&s;pect to Barrere, his authority is not &s;o great in natural hi&s;tory,
that his te&s;timony can outweigh that of all others. And, finally, his
cinereous Ame|rican Bu&s;tard is probably the female of the African Bu&s;tard,
which, according to Linnaeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Otis Afra</HI> of
Linnaeus.</NOTE>, is of an a&s;h-colour.</P>
<P>It will be perhaps a&s;ked, how a bird, which, though bulky, is furni&s;hed with wings, and &s;ometimes makes u&s;e of them, has never mi|grated into America by the &s;traits on the north, as many quadrupeds have done? I would an&s;wer, that though it flies, this is only when it is pur&s;ued; that it never makes a di&s;tant ex|cur&s;ion, and, according to the remark of Belon, has an aver&s;ion to water, and therefore could never venture to cro&s;s the wide expan&s;e of the ocean; for, though the continents approach each other towards the north, the interval is &s;till prodigious, compared with the &s;hort and tardy flight of the Bu&s;tard.</P>
<P>The Great Bu&s;tard may then be con&s;idered as a bird appropriated to the ancient continent,
<PB N="33" REF="40">
but attached to no particular climate; it inhabits the burning &s;ands of Lybia, and the frozen &s;hores of the Baltic, and occurs in all the inter|mediate countries.</P>
<P>Its fle&s;h is excellent. That of the young ones, after being kept a &s;hort time, is remark|ably delicate; and if &s;ome writers have main|tained the contrary, this ari&s;es from their con|founding <HI>otis</HI> with <HI>otus,</HI> as I have before ob|&s;erved. I know not why Hippocrates forbids per&s;ons &s;ubject to the falling &s;ickne&s;s to ta&s;te it. Pliny recommends the fat of the Bu&s;tard to allay the pain in the brea&s;ts after child-birth. The quills of this bird, like tho&s;e of the goo&s;e and the &s;wan, are u&s;ed for writing; and anglers are eager to fix them to their hooks, becau&s;e they believe that the little black &s;pots with which they are mottled, will appear to the fi&s;h as &s;o many little flies, and attract them by this deception. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The &s;pecific character of the Great Bu&s;tard, <HI>Otis-tarda:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">The head and neck of the male is tufted on both &s;ides.</Q> It is ranged in the order of the <HI>Gallinae.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS bird is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Great Bu&s;tard only by &s;ome variations in the co|lours of its plumage, and in being much &s;maller. Like the Great Bu&s;tard, al&s;o, it has received the epithet of duck <HI>(cane),</HI> though it has no ana|logy to that aquatic bird, and is never found near &s;treams or mar&s;hes. Belon pretends that this name has been applied, becau&s;e it &s;quats on the ground as the ducks do in the water<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cane-terre,</HI> changed into <HI>canepetiere.</HI></NOTE>; and Salerne imagines that it is on account of its re|&s;embling in &s;ome mea&s;ure the wild duck, and flying in the &s;ame manner. But the&s;e etymo|logical conjectures are vague and uncertain; they re&s;t on a &s;ingle point of analogy, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; and the name is therefore apt to convey a fal&s;e idea. The epi|thet
<PB N="35" REF="42">
which we have adopted is not liable to the &s;ame objections.</P>
<P>Belon &s;uppo&s;es that this bird is the <HI>tetrax</HI> of Athenaeus; re&s;ting his opinion on a pa&s;&s;age of the ancient, where it is compared, in point of &s;ize, to the <HI>&s;permologus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The <HI>tetrax,</HI></Q> &s;ays Alexander Myndius, <Q REND="inline">is a bird of the bulk of the <HI>&s;permologus,</HI> of the colour of potters clay, variegated with &s;ome dirty &s;pots and great white lines: it lives on fruits, and after it has young, it utters a cry that con&s;i&s;ts of four parts.</Q> <BIBL>ATHENAEUS, lib. ix. </BIBL></NOTE>, which he takes for the <HI>freux,</HI> a kind of large crow; but
Aldrovandus affirms, on the contrary, that the <HI>&s;permologus</HI> is a
&s;pecies of &s;parrow, and con&s;equently cannot &s;ignify the Little
Bu&s;tard: and Willoughby even a&s;&s;erts that this bird had no name among the
ancients.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus too informs us, that the fi&s;hers at Rome gave the name of <HI>&s;tella,</HI> for what rea|&s;on he does not know, to a bird which at fir&s;t he took for the Little Bu&s;tard, but afterwards, on more minute in&s;pection, he di&s;covered to be different. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this expre&s;s de|claration, Ray and Salerne &s;ay, that the Little Bu&s;tard and the <HI>&s;tella avis</HI> of Aldrovandus appear to be the &s;ame &s;pecies, and Bri&s;&s;on places it without he&s;itation among the &s;ynonyms; he &s;eems even to allege that Charleton and Wil|loughby had the &s;ame idea, though the&s;e authors have been very attentive not to confound the

Willoughby keeps the names of <HI>&s;tella</HI> and <HI>canepetiere</HI> en|tirely di&s;tinct.</NOTE>. On the other hand, Barrere, cla&s;&s;ing it with the rail, be&s;tows on it the name of <HI>ortygometra melina,</HI> and gives it a fourth toe to each foot; &s;o true is it, that the multiplicity of &s;y&s;tems, without increa&s;ing our real knowledge, only &s;erves to give birth to new errors.</P>

This mea&s;ure will &s;erve as a &s;tandard of compari&s;on, from which all the other dimen&s;ions may be deduced; but we mu&s;t not conclude with Ray, that its bulk is to that of the Great Bu&s;tard as one to two; it is as the cubes of the&s;e numbers, or as one to eight.

foot. The lower part of its leg is naked, the bill is &s;imilar to that of the

ones &s;tretch almo&s;t as far as the fir&s;t, or tho&s;e mo&s;t remote from
the body. Further, the male has not tho&s;e beards of feathers as the male of
the great &s;pecies; and Klein adds, that its plumage is not &s;o beautiful as
that of the female, contrary to what is mo&s;t u&s;ually remarked in other
birds. Excepting the&s;e &s;light differences, the two &s;pecies are per|fectly
analogous; they have the &s;ame &s;hape, the &s;ame internal di&s;po&s;ition of
parts, the &s;ame in|&s;tincts, the &s;ame habits; and it would &s;eem that the
&s;mall one was produced from the egg of the large, when it had not force
&s;ufficient to effect a complete developement.</P>
<P>The male is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the female by a double white collar, and by &s;ome other va|rieties in point of colour; but the plumage on the upper part of the body is almo&s;t the &s;ame in both &s;exes, and, as Belon has remarked, is much le&s;s liable to vary in different individuals.</P>
<P>According to Salerne, they have a particular call in the love &s;ea&s;on, which begins in May. It is the &s;ound, <HI>broo</HI> or <HI>proo,</HI> which they repeat the whole night, and are heard at a great di&s;tance. The males fight ob&s;tinately, and contend for the dominion of a certain tract; one male takes a number of females under his protection, and the
<PB N="38" REF="45">
place of their amours is trodden like a barn floor.</P>
<P>The female lays, in the month of June, three, four, or even five eggs, which are extremely beautiful, and of a &s;hining green. When the young are hatched, &s;he leads them as a hen does her chickens. They begin to fly about the middle of Augu&s;t; and when they hear a noi&s;e, they lie flat on the ground, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be cru&s;hed, rather than &s;tir from the &s;pot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne. That writer does not quote his authorities. There is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he confounds the <HI>tetrix,</HI> or wood|cock, with the <HI>tetrax,</HI> or Little Bu&s;tard; e&s;pecially as he is the only naturali&s;t who de&s;cribes minutely the amours of the Little Bu&s;tard.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The males are caught in &s;nares, into which they are decoyed by a &s;tuffed female, who&s;e cry is imitated. They are often hunted by means of the falcon; but in general it is difficult to get near them, for they are always on the watch on &s;ome ri&s;ing &s;pot in fields of oats; though never, it is &s;aid, among tho&s;e of rye or wheat. To|wards the clo&s;e of the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on they pre|pare to quit the country, and are then ob&s;erved to a&s;&s;emble in flocks, and the young ones are no longer di&s;tingui&s;hable now from the old<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>According to Belon, they feed like tho&s;e of the great &s;pecies on herbs and grain, and al&s;o on ants, beetles, and &s;mall flies; but Salerne main|tains that they live chiefly on in&s;ects, and only
<PB N="39" REF="46">
eat &s;ometimes in the &s;pring the mo&s;t tender leaves of the &s;ow-thi&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Little Bu&s;tard is not di&s;per&s;ed through &s;o wide a range as the large &s;pecies. Linnaeus &s;ays, that it is found in Europe, and particularly in France. This a&s;&s;ertion is rather vague; &s;ince there are &s;ome exten&s;ive countries in Europe, and even large provinces in France, where it is un|known. We may refer the climates of Sweden and Poland to the number of &s;uch as are unfa|vourable to its nature; for Linnaeus takes no notice of it in his <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> nor Rzaczynzki in his Natural Hi&s;tory of Poland; and Klein ne|ver &s;aw more than one at Dantzic, and it came from the <HI>menagerie</HI> of the Margrave of Ba|reith.</P>
<P>Nor can it be more common in Germany; &s;ince Fri&s;ch, who undertakes to de&s;cribe and figure the birds in that country, and who is minute on the &s;ubject of the Great Bu&s;tard, never mentions a word of this &s;pecies; and Scwenckfield never names it.</P>
<P>Ge&s;ner only in&s;erts its name in the li&s;t of tho&s;e birds which he had never &s;een; and what in|deed &s;hews this is, that he &s;uppo&s;es its feet are hairy as tho&s;e of Attagas, which affords a &s;u&s;picion that it is at lea&s;t very rare in Switzerland.</P>
<P>The authors of the Briti&s;h Zoology, who&s;e view it was to take notice of no animal but what was Briti&s;h, or at lea&s;t of Briti&s;h origin, con|ceive, that they would not have conformed to
<PB N="40" REF="47">
their plan, if they had de&s;cribed a Little Bu&s;tard that was killed in Cornwall; but which they con|&s;ider as a &s;tray bird, and by no means a native of Great Britain. So totally unknown is it in that country, that a &s;pecimen being pre&s;ented to the Royal Society, none of the members then pre&s;ent could recogni&s;e it, and they were obliged to apply to Edwards to di&s;cover its &s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Edwards' Gleanings.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Belon informs us, that, in his time, neither the amba&s;&s;adors from Venice, Ferrara, and the Pope's dominions, to whom he &s;hewed one, nor any in their train, could decide what it was, and that &s;ome of them even took it for a phea&s;ant. From this circum&s;tance he pro|perly infers that it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t very uncom|mon in Italy; and the conclu&s;ion is &s;till very probable, though Ray, in pa&s;&s;ing through Mo|dena, &s;aw one in the market. We may there|fore reckon Poland, Sweden, Great Britain, Ger|many, Switzerland, and Italy, as countries where the Little Bu&s;tard is not found. It is even likely that the range is confined with in narrower limits, and that France is the region peculiar to this bird, and the only climate &s;uited to its nature; for the French naturali&s;ts de&s;cribe it the be&s;t, and all the others, except Klein, who &s;aw one, mere|ly copy Belon. Nor mu&s;t we conclude that the Little Bu&s;tard is equally common in every part of France; there are large provinces in the King|dom where it is never &s;een. Salerne informs us,
<PB N="41" REF="48">
that it is pretty common in Beauce (where it is only a bird of pa&s;&s;age); that it arrives about the middle of April, and retires on the approach of winter: he &s;ubjoins, that it delights in poor &s;toney lands, and from this circum&s;tance it de|rives the epithet of <HI>canepetrace,</HI> or <HI>rock duck.</HI> It al&s;o occurs in Berri, where it receives a &s;imilar name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Canepetrotte.</HI></NOTE>. It mu&s;t be common in Maine and Nor|mandy; &s;ince Belon, judging of the other pro|vinces from the&s;e with which he was be&s;t ac|quainted, a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>there is not a pea&s;ant in the country who does not know its name.</HI></P>
<P>The Little Bu&s;tard is naturally cunning and &s;u&s;|picious; in&s;omuch that it has given ri&s;e to a proverb. When it is apprehen&s;ive of danger, it immediately quits the &s;pot, and, keeping clo&s;e to the ground, flies &s;wiftly 200 or 300 paces forward, and then runs &s;o fa&s;t that a man can hardly overtake it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Little Bu&s;tard is black, and is excellent food. Klein a&s;&s;ures us, that the eggs of the female in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were very palat|able, and that the fle&s;h was better than that of the female of the black grous.</P>
<P>Its internal &s;tructure is nearly the &s;ame, ac|cording to Belon, as that of the common grani|vorous birds. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>Specific character of the Little Bu&s;tard, <HI>otis-tetrax:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its head and throat &s;mooth.</Q> Latham adds, that <Q REND="inline">it is variegated with black rufous and white, and the under &s;urface white.</Q></P>

<P>THE bird which the Arabians call <HI>Lohong,</HI> and which Edwards fir&s;t figured and de&s;cribed, is nearly the &s;ize of our Great Bu&s;tard, and, like it, has three toes on each foot, turned the &s;ame way, only rather &s;horter; the feet, the bill, and the neck are longer; and, on the whole, it is ra|ther more taper-&s;haped.</P>
<P>The plumage on the upper part of the body is browner, and &s;imilar to that of the wood|cock; or it is tawny and radiated with deep brown with white &s;pots, in the form of a cre&s;cent, on its wings. The lower part of the body is white, as al&s;o the margin of the upper part of the wing. The crown of the head, the throat,
<PB N="43" REF="50">
and the fore &s;ide of the neck, are marked with tran&s;ver&s;e bars of a dull brown on a cincreous ground. The lower part of the leg, the bill, and the feet, are of a bright brown, and yel|lowi&s;h; the tail droops like that of the partridge, and is &s;tained with a cro&s;s black bar; the great quills of the wing and the cre&s;t are al&s;o of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>This cre&s;t forms a remarkable character in the Arabian Bu&s;tard; it is pointed, directed back|wards, and much inclined to the horizon: from its ba&s;e it &s;ends off two black lines, of which the longer one pa&s;&s;es over the eye, and makes a kind of eye-lid; the other, which is much &s;horter, &s;tretches under the eye, but does not reach it; the eye is black, and placed in a white &s;pace.</P>
<P>When we take a profile view of this cre&s;t at a little di&s;tance, we might fancy that we &s;ee ears pretty clo&s;e to the head, and leaning backwards; and as the Arabian Bu&s;tard was undoubtedly bet|ter known to the Greeks than ours, it is pro|bable that they named it <HI>otis,</HI> on account of the&s;e kind of ears, in the &s;ame way that they have called the long-eared owl <HI>otus</HI> or <HI>otos,</HI> by rea&s;on of two &s;imilar tufts which di&s;tingui&s;h that &s;pecies of nocturnal birds.</P>
<P>An individual of this kind, which was brought from Moka, lived &s;everal years at London, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir Hans Sloane; but Edwards, who has given us a coloured figure of it, has pre&s;erved no account of its di&s;po&s;itions, its

habits, or even of its manner of feeding; he ought at lea&s;t to have not confounded it with the gallinaceous tribes, from which it differs &s;o widely, as I have &s;hewn in the article of the Great Bu&s;tard. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus characteri&s;es the Arabian Bu&s;tard <HI>Otis Arabs,</HI> by its <Q REND="inline">erect tufted ears.</Q> It inhabits Arabia Felix, and penetrates in A&s;ia as far as the Ca&s;pian Sea.</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS is what Linnaeus makes his fourth &s;pe|cies; it differs from the Arabian Bu&s;tard by the colours of its plumage, the black predo|minating; but the back is cinereous, and the ears white.</P>
<P>In the male the bill and feet are yellow, the crown of the head a&s;h-coloured, and the exterior margin of the wings white; but the female is en|tirely cinereous, except the belly and thighs, which are black, as in the Indian Bu&s;tard.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Ethiopia, according to Linnaeus; and it is extremely probable that the
<PB N="45" REF="52">
one mentioned by the navigator Le Maire, by the name of <HI>flying o&s;trich</HI> of Senegal, is the &s;ame; for though the account given by him be &s;hort, it partly coincides and is entirely con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;cription of the naturali&s;t. Its plumage is grey and black, its fle&s;h delicious, and its &s;ize is nearly the &s;ame with that of the &s;wan. Our conjecture receives additional force from the te&s;ti|mony of Adan&s;on; that intelligent naturali&s;t hav|ing killed one of the&s;e flying o&s;triches at Senegal, and examined it narrowly, a&s;&s;ures us, that, in many re&s;pects, it is analogous to the European Bu&s;tard, but differs in the colour of its plumage, which is generally of a grey-a&s;h in the greater length of its neck, and al&s;o by a kind of cre&s;t on the back of the head.</P>
<P>This cre&s;t is evidently what Linnaeus calls the <HI>ears,</HI> and the grey-a&s;h colour is exactly that of the female; and as the&s;e are the principal cha|racters by which the African Bu&s;tard of Linnaeus and the flying o&s;trich of Senegal are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from the European Bu&s;tard, it would &s;eem that we may conclude that they have a great analogy: and for the &s;ame rea&s;on we may apply to both what is ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to each individual; for example, that they are nearly as large as our bu&s;tard, and have a longer neck. The la&s;t men|tioned circum&s;tance, noticed by Adan&s;on, is a point of re&s;emblance to the Arabian Bu&s;tard, which inhabits almo&s;t the &s;ame climate; and no|thing to the contrary can be inferred from the
<PB N="46" REF="53">
&s;ilence of Linnaeus, &s;ince he gives no mea&s;ure|ment at all of the African Bu&s;tard. With regard to bulk, Le Maire makes that of the flying o&s;trich equal to that of the &s;wan; and Adan&s;on repre&s;ents it as the &s;ame with that of the Euro|pean Bu&s;tard: &s;ince, while he mentions that the re&s;emblance is complete in many re&s;pects, and &s;tates the principal differences, he omits that of the &s;ize; and al&s;o as Ethiopia or Aby&s;&s;inia, which is the native region of the African Bu&s;tard, and Senegal, which is that of the flying o&s;trich, though widely differing in longitude, are of the &s;ame climate; I conceive that there is great pro|bability that the&s;e two birds belong to the &s;ame identical &s;pecies. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The &s;pecific character of the African Bu&s;tard, <HI>Otis Afra,</HI> is:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">That it is black, its back cinereous, its ears white.</Q> It is call|ed <HI>korr-haen</HI> by the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope.

<P>THIS Bu&s;tard is not only &s;maller than the European, the African, or the Arabian &s;pecies, but it is taller and more &s;lender. It is twenty inches high, from the crown of the head to the plane on which it &s;tands; its neck &s;eems to be &s;horter in proportion to its feet; but in other re&s;pects it is entirely analogous to the Common Bu&s;tard. It has three &s;eparate toes on each foot; the lower part of the leg is not fea|thered; the bill is &s;omewhat hooked, though more elongated. I am at a lo&s;s to conceive why Bri&s;&s;on referred it to the genus of plovers.</P>
<P>The di&s;tingui&s;hing character between the plovers and the bu&s;tards con&s;i&s;ts, according to that naturali&s;t, in the form of the bill; which, in the latter, is an arched cone, and in the for|mer it is &s;traight, and enlarged near the extre|mity. But in the Indian plover the bill is curved rather than &s;traight, and not at all &s;wel|ling near the point as in the plovers; at lea&s;t &s;o
<PB N="48" REF="55">
it is repre&s;ented in a figure of Edwards, which Bri&s;&s;on allows to be exact. I may add, that this property is more remarkable than in the Arabian Bu&s;tard of Edwards, the accuracy of which figure is al&s;o admitted by Bri&s;&s;on; and yet he has not he&s;itated to cla&s;s it with the bu&s;tards.</P>
<P>We need only ca&s;t a glance on the figure of the Indian Bu&s;tard, and compare it with tho&s;e of the plovers, to be convinced that it differs totally in its appearance and proportions: its neck is longer, its wings &s;horter, and its &s;hape more expanded; and be&s;ides, it is four times the bulk of the large&s;t plover, who&s;e extreme length is only &s;ixteen inches, while that of the Indian Bu&s;tard is twenty-&s;ix<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is con&s;i&s;tent with the mea&s;ure I have &s;tated above, that it is twenty inches from the crown of the head to the plane on which it &s;tands; for the bill and toes are not then taken into ac|count.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Black, fulvous, white, and grey, are the pre|dominant colours of its plumage, as in the Eu|ropean Bu&s;tard; but they are differently di&s;tri|buted. The black is &s;pread on the crown of the head, on the neck, the thighs, and the lower part of the body; a bright yellow occupies the &s;ides of the head and the circuit of the eyes; a browner yellow, and one more &s;haded with black, &s;tains the back, the tail, that part of the wings next the back, and the top of the brea&s;t, where it forms a broad belt on a dark
<PB N="49" REF="56">
ground; the white appears on the coverts of the wings farthe&s;t from the back, and white mixed with black on the intermediate &s;pace; the deepe&s;t gray is laid on the eye-lids, the extremity of the longe&s;t quills of the wing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As in &s;ome of the European Bu&s;tards. <BIBL>PERRAULT.</BIBL></NOTE>, of &s;ome of the middle and &s;horte&s;t ones, and on &s;ome of their coverts; la&s;tly, the brighte&s;t gray, which verges on white, is &s;pread on the bill and the feet.</P>

<P>THIS bird, though a dome&s;tic, and the mo&s;t common of all, is &s;till, perhaps, not &s;uffi|ciently known. Mo&s;t per&s;ons, if we except the few who be&s;tow particular attention on the pro|ductions of Nature, need &s;ome information with re&s;pect to the peculiarities of its external form, and of its internal &s;tructure; its habits, original and acquired; the differences occa&s;ioned by &s;ex, climate, or food; and concerning the various races which &s;ooner or later have branched from the primitive &s;tock.</P>
<P>But if the Cock be too little known by the bulk of men, what embarra&s;&s;ment mu&s;t it give to the methodical naturali&s;t, who is never &s;atisfied till he refer every object to his cla&s;&s;es and ge|nera? If he adopts the number of toes as the foundation of his &s;y&s;tem, he will range it with the birds that have four. But what place will

<HEAD>N^o. 31 THE DOMESTIC COCK.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="55" REF="63"> he a&s;&s;ign to the hen with five toes, which
is undoubtedly of the gallinaceous tribe, and of an ancient family; &s;ince it
can be traced to the time of Columella, who mentions it as a gene|rous
breed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> <Q REND="inline">They are reckoned the mo&s;t noble which have
five toes.</Q> <BIBL>COLUMELLA, lib. viii. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>? If he forms the Cock into a
&s;epa|rate genus, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ingular &s;hape of its tail,
where will he place the Cock that has no rump, and con&s;equently no tail, but
which &s;till belongs to the &s;ame family? If he admits that the legs clothed
with plumage to the heels, is a generic character, will he not be puzzled in
cla&s;&s;ing the rough-footed Cock, which is fea|thered to the origin of the
toes, and the Japa|ne&s;e Cock, which is feathered as far as the nails?
La&s;tly, If he would refer the gallinaceous birds to the granivorous tribe,
and infer, from the number and &s;tructure of their &s;tomachs and
inte&s;tines, that they were de&s;tined to feed on grain and vegetable
&s;ub&s;tances, how will he ac|count for the fondne&s;s which they di&s;cover
for earth-worms and minced-meat, whether raw or cooked? But perhaps, while he
imagines that the long inte&s;tines and double &s;tomachs in poul|try prove
that they are granivorous birds, he would al&s;o conclude, from the hooked
&s;hape of their bill, they are al&s;o vermivorous, or even carnivorous. What
ab&s;urdities and contradic|tions! Such are the feeble efforts of a little 
<PB N="56" REF="64"> mind, which being unable to comprehend the exten&s;ion and
grandeur of the univer&s;e, endea|vours to confine it within the tramels of
&s;y&s;tem! And to what trifling and vague &s;peculations do the&s;e attempts
give ri&s;e? For our parts, we &s;hall not attempt to connect the birds by a
&s;cien|tific chain; we &s;hall only join tho&s;e together that &s;eem the
mo&s;t analogous; but we &s;hall endeavour to mark their characteristic
features, and note particularly the leading facts in their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Cock is a heavy bird, who&s;e gait is com|po&s;ed and &s;low. His wings are very &s;hort, and hence he flies &s;eldom, and &s;ometimes his &s;creams indicate the violence of the effort. He crows either in the night or day, but not regularly at certain hours; and his note differs widely from that of the female. Some hens make a kind of crowing, though fainter and not &s;o di&s;tinctly articulated. He &s;crapes the ground to &s;eek his food, and &s;wallows, with the grains, little peb|bles, which rather a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion. He drinks, by taking a little water into his bill, and rai&s;ing his head at each draught. He &s;leeps oftene&s;t with one foot in the air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The thigh on which the body re&s;ts is commonly more fle&s;hy than the other; and our epicures know well how to di&s;tingui&s;h them.</NOTE>, and his head covered by the wing on the &s;ame &s;ide. In its natural &s;ituation, the body is nearly parallel to the
<PB N="57" REF="65">
ground, and &s;o is the bill; the neck ri&s;es verti|cally, the forehead is ornamented with a red fle&s;hy comb, and the under-part of the bill with a double pendant of the &s;ame colour and &s;ub|&s;tance; this however is neither fle&s;h nor mem|brane, but of a peculiar nature, different from every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>In both &s;exes the no&s;trils are &s;ituated on either &s;ide of the upper mandible, and the ears on either &s;ide of the head, and below each ear a white piece of &s;kin is &s;pread. The feet have commonly four toes, &s;ometimes five, but always three of them placed behind. The feathers ri&s;e two and two from each &s;haft; a remarkable character, which has been noticed by few na|turali&s;ts. The tail is nearly &s;traight, but admits of a &s;mall elevation and depre&s;&s;ion. In tho&s;e gallinaceous tribes where it is &s;ingle, it con|&s;i&s;ts of fourteen feathers, which are parted into two unequal planes that join at their upper mar|gin, making an angle more or le&s;s acute. But what di&s;tingui&s;hes the male is, that the two fea|thers in the middle of the tail are much longer than the re&s;t, and are bent into an arch; that the feathers of the tail and rump are long and narrow, and that the feet are armed with &s;purs. It is in|deed true, that &s;ome hens al&s;o have &s;purs, but this rarely occurs; and in &s;uch hens there are many other points of re&s;emblance to the male; their comb and tail are arched the &s;ame way; they imitate the crowing of the cock, and would even
<PB N="58" REF="66">
attempt to perform his office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. ix. 49.</BIBL></NOTE>. But we &s;hould be mi&s;taken, were we to infer that they are hermaphrodites; they are unfit for procreation, and aver&s;e to the male embrace; we mu&s;t re|gard them as imperfect degenerate individuals, wherein the &s;exual character is obliterated.</P>
<P>A good Cock is one who&s;e eyes &s;parkle with fire, who has boldne&s;s in his demeanour, and freedom in his motions, and all who&s;e proportions di&s;play force. Such a bird would not indeed &s;trike terror into a lion, as has often been &s;aid and written, but would command the love of the females, and place him&s;elf at the head of a numerous flock of hens. To &s;pare him, he ought not to be allowed more than twelve or fifteen. Columella recommends that the&s;e &s;hould not exceed five; but, though the Cock &s;hould have fifty a-day, it is &s;aid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE> that he would not neglect one. Yet no one can be certain that all his embraces are efficatious, and &s;uffici|ent to fecundate the eggs of the female. His lu&s;t &s;eems to be as fiery as his gratifications are frequent. In the morning, the fir&s;t thing he does, after he is let out from his roo&s;t, is to tread his hens. Food &s;eems to him only a &s;e|condary want; and if he is deprived for &s;ome time of the company of his family, he makes his addre&s;&s;es to the fir&s;t female that he meets,
<PB N="59" REF="67">
though of a very different &s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A cro&s;s-breed is produced between a Cock and the hen-partridge, which through time grows like the female. <BIBL>ARISTOTLE, lib. ix. 49.</BIBL></NOTE>, and even courts the fir&s;t male that occurs. The fir&s;t fact is mentioned by Ari&s;totle; the &s;econd is proved by an ob&s;ervation of Edwards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Having &s;hut up three or four Cocks in a place where they could have no commerce with any hen, they &s;oon laid a&s;ide the&iuml;r former animo&s;ity; and, in&s;tead of fighting, each tried the other, though none &s;eemed willing to &s;ubmit. <BIBL><HI>Preface to the Gleanings.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; and by a law mentioned by Plutarch, in which it was enacted, that a Cock convicted of this unnatural act, &s;hould be burnt alive<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In his treati&s;e on the que&s;tion, "Whether brutes rea&s;on?"</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hens mu&s;t be &s;elected for the Cock, if we would have a genuine race; but if we want to vary and improve the &s;pecies, the breed mu&s;t be cro&s;&s;ed. This ob&s;ervation did not e&s;cape the an|cients: Columella expre&s;sly mentions, that the be&s;t poultry is produced by the union of a Cock of a foreign family with the ordinary hens; and we find in Athenaeus, that this idea was im|proved, a cock-phea&s;ant being given to the com|mon hens<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Re Ru&s;tica,</HI> lib. viii. 2.</BIBL> Longolius de&s;cribes the method of a&s;&s;ociating the cock-phea&s;ant with common hens. <BIBL>GESNER <HI>de Avibus.</HI></BIBL> I am a&s;&s;ured that the Guinea Cock al&s;o treads the hens, if educated together, but that the breed are rather barren.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e we ought to chu&s;e tho&s;e hens which have a lively eye, a flowing red comb, and
<PB N="60" REF="68">
have no &s;purs. The proportions of their body are in general more &s;lender than the males; yet their feathers are broader, and their legs &s;horter. Sagacious farmers prefer black hens, becau&s;e they are more prolific than the white, and more ea&s;ily e&s;cape the piercing &s;ight of the birds of rapine which hover near the farm-yard.</P>
<P>The Cock is extremely watchful of his fe|males, and even filled with inquietude and anxie|ty; he hardly ever lo&s;es &s;ight of them; he leads them, defends them, and threatens them with his menaces; collects them together when they &s;traggle, and never eats till he has the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them feeding around him. To judge from the different inflexions of his voice, and the various &s;ignificant ge&s;tures which he makes, we cannot doubt but the&s;e are a &s;pecies of lan|guage that &s;erves to communicate his &s;entiments. When he lo&s;es them, he utters his griefs. Though as jealous as he is amorous, he abu&s;es not his wives, but turns his rage again&s;t his rivals. When another Cock is pre&s;ented, he allows no time for feduction; he in&s;tantly ru&s;hes forward, his eyes fla&s;hing fire, and his feathers bri&s;tled, and makes a furious attack on his rival, and fights ob&s;tinately till one or the other fall, or the interloper leave the field. The de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, ever exce&s;&s;ive, not only prompts him to drive away every rival, but to remove the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive ob&s;tacles; he beats off and &s;ometimes kills the chickens, that he may enjoy the mother more at his ea&s;e. Is
<PB N="61" REF="69">
this appetite the &s;ole cau&s;e of his furious jea|lou&s;y? In the mid&s;t of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;eraglio, how can he apprehend any bounds to his gratifica|tion? But how ardent &s;oever be his pa&s;&s;ions, he &s;eems to be more aver&s;e to &s;hare the plea&s;ures than eager to ta&s;te them; and as his powers are greater, &s;o his jealou&s;y is more excu&s;able and better founded than that of other &s;ultans. Like them al&s;o, he has his favourite female, whom he courts with greater a&s;&s;iduity, and on whom he be&s;tows his favours as often nearly as on all the re&s;t together.</P>
<P>What proves that in Cocks jealou&s;y is a pa&s;|&s;ion founded on reflection is, that many of them are perpetually fighting with each other in the court-yard, while they never attack the capons, at lea&s;t if the&s;e are not in the habit of following the hens.</P>
<P>Man, who is dexterous in drawing amu&s;e|ment from every quarter, has learnt to &s;et into action that invincible antipathy which Nature has implanted in one Cock to another. So much have they fo&s;tered this native hatred, that the battles of two dome&s;tic birds have become &s;pec|tacles fit to attract the curio&s;ity of people even in poli&s;hed &s;ociety; and at the &s;ame time, the&s;e have been con&s;idered as the means of calling forth or maintaining that precious ferocity, which is, they &s;ay, the &s;ource of heroi&s;m. Formerly, and even at pre&s;ent in more than one country, men of all ranks crowd to the&s;e grote&s;que com|bats,
<PB N="62" REF="70">
divide into parties, grow heated for the for|tune of their favourite Cock, heighten the in|tere&s;t of the exhibition by the mo&s;t extravagant bets; and the fate of families is decided by the la&s;t &s;troke of the victorious bird. Such was an|ciently the madne&s;s of the Rhodians, the Tan|grians, and the people of Pergamus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pliny, lib. x. 21.</BIBL></NOTE>; and &s;uch at pre&s;ent is that of the Chine&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gemelli Careri, Ancient Accounts of India and China.</BIBL></NOTE>, of the in|habitants of the Philippine i&s;lands, of Java, of the i&s;thmus of America, and of &s;ome other na|tions in both continents<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Navarette, <HI>De&s;cription de la Chine.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But Cocks are not the only birds that have been thus abu&s;ed: the Athenians, who allotted one day in the year<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">When Themi&s;tocles was about to give battle to the Per&s;ians, ob&s;erving his troops di&s;pirited, he pointed to two Cocks that were fighting: <Q REND="inline">See,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">the un&s;haken courage of the&s;e ani|mals; yet they have no other motive than the love of victory.

varies according to the dif|ferent &s;chools where they are formed, and the
different weapons, offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, with which they are armed; but
it is curious that <PB N="63" REF="71"> the Rhodian Cocks, though larger,
&s;tronger, and better fighters than the others, were not &s;o ar|dent for the
females, and had only three hens, in&s;tead of fifteen or twenty; whether
becau&s;e their fire was extingui&s;hed in the con&s;trained &s;o|litude in
which they were accu&s;tomed to live, or becau&s;e their rage, being too often
rou&s;ed, had &s;tifled in them the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, which, however, were
at fir&s;t the principle of their cou|rage and the &s;ource of their ho&s;tile
di&s;po&s;ition. The males of that breed were therefore le&s;s vi|gorous, and
the females le&s;s prolific and more in|dolent, both in laying eggs and
watching their chickens.&mdash;So &s;ucce&s;sful has Art been in degrading
Nature! and &s;o unfavourable are the talents for war to the bu&s;ine&s;s of

<P>Hens need not the embrace of the Cock to pro|cure eggs; the&s;e are continually detached from the bunch in the ovarium, which grows independent of the union with the male. As they enlarge, they acquire maturity, &s;eparate from their calyx and pedicle, pa&s;s through the whole length of the <HI>oviductus,</HI> and in their road a&s;&s;imilate, by a cer|tain power that they po&s;&s;e&s;s, the lymph with which the duct is filled, and form it into their white, their coats, and their &s;hell. There they remain till the &s;en&s;ible and ela&s;tic fibres being &s;tretched and &s;timulated by the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which have now become foreign, contract and extrude them, the large end being foremo&s;t according to Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="72">
The&s;e eggs are all that the prolific quality of the female can produce alone and una&s;&s;i&s;ted; &s;he exudes an organized body, indeed, &s;u&s;ceptible of a kind of life, but not a living animal &s;imilar to the mother, and in its turn capable of con|tinuing the race. This requires the union of the male, and intimate mixture of the &s;eminal li|quors of both &s;exes; but when once this has taken place, its effects are durable. Dr. Harvey ob&s;erved, that the egg of a hen, which had been &s;eparated twenty days from the Cock, was not le&s;s prolific than one laid newly after treading, and that the embryo was not on that account more advanced, and required the &s;ame length of incubation; a certain proof that heat alone can|not produce or promote the developement of the chick, but that the egg mu&s;t be formed, or at lea&s;t placed where it can per&s;pire, in order that the embryo inclo&s;ed may be &s;u&s;ceptible of in|cubation, otherwi&s;e all the eggs which remain in the oviduct twenty-one days after fecunda|tion would hatch, &s;ince they would have the proper time and heat; and, in this ca&s;e, hens would be &s;ometimes oviparous, &s;ometimes vivi|parous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know of no per&s;on, except Dr. Michael Lyzeruts, who &s;aw a viviparous hen.

<P>The mean weight of the egg of an ordinary hen is one ounce &s;ix grains. If we open it care|fully,
<PB N="65" REF="73">
we may perceive, immediately under the &s;hell, a common membrane which lines the whole of the inner cavity; then, the external white, which has the form of this cavity; next, the in|ternal white, which is rounder than the preced|ing; and la&s;tly, in the centre of this white, we find the yolk, which is &s;pherical.

for from the hi&s;tory of the egg it&s;elf and its formation.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to find two yolks included in the &s;ame &s;hell.

<P>Hens lay through the whole year, except the time of moulting, which generally la&s;ts &s;ix weeks or two months, about the end of autumn and the beginning of the winter. This moulting is nothing but the &s;hedding of the old feathers, which are detached like the old leaves of trees and the antlers of &s;tags, being excluded by the growth of the new. The Cocks al&s;o &s;uffer this renovation; but it is remarkable that the new feathers &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ume a different colour. One of our ob&s;ervers has noticed this fact in a hen and a cock, and every per&s;on may remark it in many other kinds of birds, particularly in tho&s;e that are brought from Bengal, which change their tints at almo&s;t every moulting; and, in ge|neral, the colours of the fir&s;t feathers, in by far the greate&s;t number of birds, are different from what they afterwards become.</P>
<P>The ordinary fecundity of hens is limited to the laying an egg each day. There are &s;ome, it is &s;aid, in Samogitia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rzacyn&s;ki, <HI>Nat. Hi&s;t. Poland.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, Malacca<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL> Bontekoe, <HI>Voyage aux Indes Orientales.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, and other places, that lay twice a-day. Ari&s;totle mentions certain hens of Illyria, which laid &s;o often as thrice a-day;
<PB N="69" REF="77">
and it is probable that the&s;e were the &s;ame with the Adrian or Adriatic hens, of which he &s;peaks in another place, and which were noted for their prolific quality. Some add, that there is a peculiar mode of feeding common hens, which gives them this prodigious fecundity.

of ardent de&s;ire; that he darts upon the hen, who receives him, bending her legs, &s;quatting on the ground, and laying a&s;ide the two fans of feathers which compo&s;e her tail; that then he &s;eizes with his bill the cre&s;t or tuft on the head of the female, either by way of care&s;&s;ing her, or of keeping his balance; that he bends the hind part of his body, where his double yard is lodg|ed, and applies it bri&s;kly where the corre&s;pond|ing orifice is placed; that this copulation la&s;ts the &s;horter time the oftener it is repeated, and that the Cock &s;eems to boa&s;t of his performance by clapping his wings, and by a kind of crowing of joy or victory; that he has te&s;ticles, and that his &s;eminal liquor is contained, like that of the quadrupeds, in &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els.

<P>Its fir&s;t known effect is the dilation of the <HI>cicatricula,</HI> and the formation of the chick in its cavity; for it is this <HI>cicatricula</HI> which contains the true germ, and occurs in eggs whether fer|tile or not, and even in tho&s;e pretended Cocks eggs which I have already &s;poken of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De la Peyronie ob&s;erved in one of the&s;e eggs a round yellow &s;pot, of a line in diameter, but without any &s;en&s;ible thickne&s;s, &s;ituated on the membrane that adheres to the &s;hell.

She has entru&s;ted this charge chiefly to the mother, by in&s;piring the in&s;tinct of cover|ing the eggs. In mo&s;t hens this propen&s;ity is felt as &s;trongly, and marked by as &s;ignificant &s;igns as copulation, to which it &s;ucceeds in the order of nature, and even though it is not ex|cited by the pre&s;ence of an egg. A hen that has ju&s;t laid, is kindled with tran&s;ports that are communicated to others which are only mere &s;pectators, and they all join in the repeated clamorous bur&s;ts of joy; either becau&s;e the &s;ud|den ce&s;&s;ation of the pains of delivery is always accompanied with a lively plea&s;ure, or that the mother then anticipates all the delights of pro|geny. Whatever be the cau&s;e, certain it is, that when &s;he has laid twenty-five or thirty eggs, &s;he deliberately prepares to &s;it on them.

<P>The effect of incubation is confined merely to the development of the embryo of the
<PB N="75" REF="83">
chick, which, as we have already &s;aid, exi&s;ts al|ready formed in the <HI>cicatricula</HI> of the fecundated egg. The following is nearly the order in which this developement is made, or rather as it appears to the ob&s;erver; and as I have el&s;ewhere given a pretty full account of the facts relating to this &s;ubject, I &s;hall only repeat the more important circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>At the end of five or &s;ix hours, the head of the chick is di&s;tinctly &s;een joined to the dor&s;al &s;pine, &s;wimming in the liquor, with which the &s;peck in the centre of the <HI>cicatricula</HI> is filled; and to|wards the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t day, the head is al|ready bent back by its enlargement.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day are perceived the fir&s;t traces of the <HI>vertebrae,</HI> which are like &s;mall globules di&s;po&s;ed on the two &s;ides of the middle of the &s;pine; the wings and umbilical ve&s;&s;els al&s;o begin to appear, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their dull colour; the neck and brea&s;t are unfolded, and the head con&s;tantly increa&s;es; the outlines of the eyes, and the three encircling coats, as well as the &s;pine and membranes, are now &s;een. The life of the foetus is decided; the heart beats, and the blood circulates.</P>
<P>On the third day, the whole is more di&s;tinct and expanded. It is remarkable, that the heart hangs out of the brea&s;t, and beats three times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; once, in receiving from the auricle the blood contained in the veins; a &s;econd time, in di&s;charging it into the arteries; and a third
<PB N="76" REF="84">
time, in forcing it into the umbilical ve&s;&s;els; and this motion continues for twenty-four hours after the embryo has been &s;eparated from the white of its egg. We al&s;o di&s;cover the veins and arteries on the ve&s;icles of the brain, and the rudiments of the &s;pinal marrow beginning to extend along the <HI>vertebrae.</HI> La&s;tly, we &s;ee the whole foetus enveloped in a part of the &s;ur|rounding liquor which has acquired a greater con&s;i&s;tence than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>On the fourth day the eyes are con&s;iderably advanced; we can di&s;tingui&s;h the pupil, the cry&s;talline lens, and the vitreous humour. We al&s;o perceive in the head five ve&s;icles filled with a fluid which, approaching each other, and gradually coale&s;cing on the following days, form at la&s;t the brain inve&s;ted with its coats. The wings grow, the thighs begin to appear, and the body to acquire bulk. On the fifth day the whole body is covered with an unctu|ous fle&s;h; the heart is confined by a very thin membrane, which &s;preads over the che&s;t; and the umbilical ve&s;&s;els ri&s;e out of the abdo|men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ve&s;&s;els which &s;pread in the yolk of the egg, and which are con&s;equently without the abdomen, &s;oon retire into the cavity, according to the remark of Steno. <BIBL><HI>Collection Academique.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day the &s;pinal marrow, being di|vided into two parts, continues to &s;tretch along the trunk; the liver, which was before whiti&s;h,
<PB N="77" REF="85">
is now become of a du&s;ky colour; the heart beats with its two ventricles; the body of the chick is covered with a &s;kin, and even the feathers begin to &s;prout.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y, on the &s;eventh day, to di&s;tingui&s;h the bill; the brain, the wings, the thighs, and the legs, have acquired their perfect &s;hape; the two ventricles of the heart appear like two bubbles, contiguous and joined above to the &s;ub&s;tance of the auricles. Two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mo|tions are ob&s;erved in the ventricles, as well as in the auricles, which re&s;emble two &s;eparate hearts.</P>
<P>About the end of the ninth day the lungs appear, and are of a whiti&s;h colour. On the tenth day the mu&s;cles of the wings are com|pletely formed, and the feathers continue to &s;hoot. It is not till the eleventh day that we per|ceive the arteries, which were before at a di&s;tance from the heart, cohere to it; and this organ is now perfect and united into two ventricles.</P>
<P>The following days are &s;pent in the farther expan&s;ion of the parts, which continues till the chick breaks its &s;hell; and this happens com|monly the twenty-fir&s;t day, &s;ometimes the eighteenth, and at others, the twenty-&s;eventh.</P>
<P>All this train of phaenomena, which pre|&s;ents &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;pectacle to the ob&s;erver, is the effect of incubation by a hen; and hu|man indu&s;try has found it not beneath its no|tice to imitate the proce&s;s. Formerly, the rude
<PB N="78" REF="86">
pea&s;ants of Egypt, and in our own times phi|lo&s;ophers, have &s;ucceeded in hatching eggs, as well as the mo&s;t careful &s;itter, and have given birth to amazing numbers at once. The whole &s;ecret con&s;i&s;ts in keeping the eggs at a tempera|ture which nearly corre&s;ponds to the warmth of the hen, and in preventing every kind of humi|dity and pernicious exhalations, &s;uch as tho&s;e of charcoal, burning fuel, and even that of tainted eggs. By ob&s;erving the&s;e two conditions, and being attentive in repeatedly &s;hifting the eggs, and varying the place of the oven or &s;tove where the ba&s;kets are placed, &s;o that not only each egg, but every part of it may enjoy alike the requi&s;ite heat, we &s;hall &s;ucceed in hatching mil|lions of chickens.</P>
<P>Every kind of heat is favourable; nor is the warmth of the hen better than that of any other animal, not even excepting man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Livia was pregnant, &s;he cheri&s;hed an egg in her bo&s;om, with a view of foretelling the &s;ex of her expected child from that of the chicken which would be hatched. It was a cock, and &s;he had a boy. The augurs turned the accident to their advantage, and endeavoured to convince the incredulous of the reality of their art. But what was better proved is, that the heat of the human body is &s;ufficient for the incubation of eggs.</NOTE>, nor than the &s;olar or terre&s;trial fires, or the heat of a bed of oak-bark or dung. The e&s;&s;ential point is to be able to regulate the heat; to increa&s;e or dimi|ni&s;h at plea&s;ure. We can always know the degree by means of good thermometers placed in different parts within the oven or &s;tove; we
<PB N="79" REF="87">
can pre&s;erve the heat, by &s;topping the openings and &s;hutting the regi&s;ters of the lid; we can augment it with warm a&s;hes, if it be an oven, or by adding wood, if a &s;tove; or u&s;ing chafing|di&s;hes, if it be a bed; and we can dimini&s;h it, by opening the regi&s;ters to give acce&s;s to the external air, or at lea&s;t by introducing into the oven cold bodies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But, whatever attention be be&s;towed in regu|lating the furnace, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to main|tain con&s;tantly, and without interruption, the 32d<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">104&deg;, Farenheit.</NOTE> degree of heat, which is that of the hen. Fortunately, this limit is not very determined; and a heat varying from the 38th<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">117&deg;&frac12;, F.</NOTE> to the 24th<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">86&deg;, F.</NOTE> degree, is found to occa&s;ion no incon|venience. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that the exce&s;s is more to be dreaded than the defect, and that a few hours at the 38th degree, or even the 36&deg;<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">113&deg;, F.</NOTE>, is more injurious than &s;ome days at 24&deg;. And a proof that a &s;till le&s;s heat would occa&s;ion no inconvenience is, that a par|tridge's ne&s;t being di&s;covered in a meadow that was mowing, they were kept in the &s;hade for thirty-&s;ix hours, (no hen being found during that time to cover them,) and yet they all hatched at the end of three days, except tho&s;e which were opened to perceive what condition they were in. They were indeed very far ad|vanced,
<PB N="80" REF="88">
and it undoubtedly required a greater degree of heat at the beginning than near the clo&s;e of the incubation, when the heat of the little chick was almo&s;t alone &s;ufficient for its de|velopment.</P>
<P>With regard to humidity, as it is very hurt|ful to the progre&s;s of incubation, we mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with certain means of di&s;covering whether it has penetrated into the oven, and be able to expel it, if it has penetrated, and pre|vent its return.</P>
<P>The hygrometer, which is the &s;imple&s;t and fitte&s;t for e&s;timating the humidity of the air in the&s;e &s;orts of ovens, is a cold egg introduced and kept &s;ome time, till it acquire a proper heat. If, at the end of a quarter of an hour or more, the egg is covered with a light dew, &s;uch as that formed by the breath on poli&s;hed gla&s;s, or what falls on the out&s;ide of a tumbler in which a freez|ing mixture is made, this is a proof that the air of the oven is too humid; and the more &s;o, the longer time the moi&s;ture takes to di&s;&s;ipate. This happens chiefly in a tan-bed, and in dung com|po&s;ts inclo&s;ed in a confined place. The be&s;t way to remedy this inconvenience is to renew the air, where it is clo&s;e, by means of currents produced by oppo&s;ite windows; or, in&s;tead of the&s;e, by fixing ventilators proportioned to the &s;pace. Sometimes the mere per&s;piration of the immen&s;e number of eggs occa&s;ions an exce&s;s of humidity in the oven it&s;elf: in this ca&s;e
<PB N="81" REF="89">
the ba&s;kets with the eggs ought to be taken out, for a few minutes, every two or three days, and fanned with a hat, waving it in different di|rections.</P>
<P>But it is not enough that the moi&s;ture which collects within the oven be expelled; we mu&s;t prevent the entrance of humidity from without, by lining the in&s;ide with &s;heet-lead, good ce|ment, pla&s;ter, a proper mixture of pitch and tar, or at lea&s;t by &s;preading it over with &s;everal coats of oil, and allowing this to dry, and glu|ing on the interior &s;urface &s;tripes of bladder or of grey paper.</P>
<P>To the&s;e few ea&s;y practical operations is re|duced the whole art of artificial incubation; and hence are deduced the &s;tructure and dimen|&s;ions of the ovens or &s;toves, the number, &s;hape, and di&s;tribution of the ba&s;kets, and all the little manoeuvres which the circum&s;tances require, or the occa&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ts, which have been de&s;cribed with a profu&s;ion of words, but which we &s;hall compri&s;e in a few lines, without omitting any thing e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>The &s;imple&s;t oven is a ca&s;k lined within with glued paper, and &s;topped at the head with a cover which joins into it, and which is perforated in the middle by a large opening, that &s;huts with a grooved lid, to allow an opportunity of exa|mining the oven. There are &s;everal other &s;mall holes round this, which &s;erve as regi&s;ters to re|gulate the heat, and which can al&s;o be &s;topped
<PB N="82" REF="90">
with grooved covers. This ca&s;k is buried three|fourths of its height in warm dung. In the in&s;ide there are placed, one above another, at proper di&s;tances, two or three wide-ribbed ba&s;|kets, in each of which two rows of eggs are piled, taking care that the upper layer be thinner than the lower, &s;o that this may be ea&s;ily &s;een through the other. Small holes may be made, if we chu&s;e, in the centre of each ba&s;ket; and well-graduated thermometers &s;u&s;pended there, and others placed in different parts of the circumference. Thus the requi&s;ite heat may be maintained, and the chickens u&s;hered into life.</P>
<P>If we would be oeconomical of heat, and draw utility from what is commonly loft, we may employ, for artificial incubation, that of the ovens for bakers and pa&s;try-cooks, of forges, and gla&s;s-hou&s;es, and even that of a chamber-&s;tove, or a kitchen-grate, con&s;tantly keeping in mind that the &s;ucce&s;s will depend chiefly on the equal di&s;tribution of heat, and the total exclu|&s;ion of humidity.</P>
<P>When the ovens are large and well-managed, they exclude thou&s;ands of chickens at a time. This profu&s;ion would be rather inconvenient in a climate like ours, if we had not as well di&s;|covered a method of rearing the brood indepen|dently of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the hen, as of hatch|ing them without her incubation. This con&s;i&s;ts in a more or le&s;s perfect imitation of the man|ner
<PB N="83" REF="91">
in which the mother treats her young after they have emerged from the &s;hell.</P>
<P>We &s;hall ea&s;ily conceive, that the mother which &s;hews &s;o &s;trong an inclination to cover her eggs, &s;its on them with &s;uch unre|mitting a&s;&s;iduity, and takes &s;o lively a con|cern for embryos that have yet no being, will not cool in her attachment after her chickens are hatched. Her affection is heightened by the &s;ight of the&s;e little creatures, that owe to her their exi&s;tence; it is every day increa&s;ed by the repetition of cares which their feeblene&s;s re|quires. Continually employed in watching over them, &s;he &s;eeks food, merely to &s;atisfy their craving wants. If &s;he cannot find it, &s;he &s;crapes the earth with her nails to extract the nouri&s;hment concealed in its bo&s;om, and freely be&s;tows it on her young. She recals them when they wander, &s;preads her wings over them to defend them again&s;t the inclemency of the wea|ther, and broods a &s;econd time. She enters into the&s;e tender concerns with &s;o much ardour and anxiety, that her health is vi&s;ibly impaired, and &s;he can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other hen by her ruffled feathers, her trailing wings: and the hoar&s;ene&s;s of her voice, and the different inflections, are all expre&s;&s;ive of her &s;ituation, and mark &s;olicitude and maternal affection.</P>
<P>But if &s;he neglects her&s;elf in pre&s;erving her young, &s;he expo&s;es her&s;elf to every danger in their defence. If a &s;parrow-hawk appear in the
<PB N="84" REF="92">
air, this mother, &s;o feeble, &s;o timid, and which in every other circum&s;tance would con&s;ult her &s;afety by flight, becomes intrepid, from the warmth of attachment, darts before the dreaded talon, and by her repeated cries, the clapping her wings, and her undaunted re&s;olution, &s;he often intimidates the rapacious bird, which, re|pul&s;ed by the unexpected re&s;i&s;tance, retires to &s;eek ea&s;ier prey. She then &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qualities of a generous mind; but what re|flects no le&s;s honour on her in&s;tinct is, that if &s;he has been made to &s;it on ducks eggs, or tho&s;e of any other water-foul, her affection is no le&s;s ardent for the&s;e &s;trangers than for her own progeny. She does not perceive that &s;he is only their nur&s;e, and not their mother; and when, directed by nature, they plunge into the neighbouring &s;tream, it is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve the a&s;toni&s;hment, unea&s;ine&s;s, and vexation of the poor nur&s;e, who fancies &s;he is &s;till a mo|ther; impelled on the one hand by the de&s;ire of following them into the mid&s;t of the water, checked on the other by the invincible repug|nance to that element, tea&s;ing her&s;elf with fruitle&s;s bu&s;tling along the margin, trembling, forlorn, beholding her family in imminent dan|ger, and not daring to afford them help.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upply all the a&s;&s;i|duities of the hen in rai&s;ing her young, if the &s;ame degree of attention were required, and an equal affection with that of the mother. We
<PB N="85" REF="93">
&s;hall &s;ucceed by noticing the principal circum|&s;tances in the conduct of the hen to her pro|geny, and by imitating them as much as we can. For example, it being ob&s;erved, that the chief object of the mother's attention is to lead the chickens where they can find food, and to guard them again&s;t cold and the inclemency of the weather; a plan has been formed to effect this, and with even more advantage than from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the hen her&s;elf. If they be hatched in winter, they are kept a month or &s;ix weeks in a &s;tove, heated to the &s;ame degree with the ovens for incubation, and only let out five or &s;ix times a-day to eat in open air, and e&s;pecially to enjoy the &s;un. The warmth of the &s;tove pro|motes their growth, and the expo&s;ure to the air &s;trengthens and braces them. Crumbs of bread, yolks of eggs, and millet &s;eeds, are their fir&s;t food. If the incubation be performed in &s;um|mer, they are kept in the &s;tove only three or four days; and in all &s;ea&s;ons they are brought out of the &s;tove only to be put into the crib, which is a kind of &s;quare cage, &s;hut with a front of grating made of iron wire, or &s;imple netting, and clo&s;ed above with a hinged lid. In this cage the chickens are fed; but after they have eaten enough, and taken &s;ufficient exerci&s;e, they mu&s;t be &s;heltered &s;o as to allow them to enjoy warmth and repo&s;e. Hence the chickens that are led by their mother are accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;emble under the covert of her wings. For this purpo&s;e Rea|mur
<PB N="86" REF="94">
contrived an <HI>artificial mother</HI>; this is a box formed of &s;heeps &s;kin, the bottom of which is &s;quare, and the upper part &s;loped like the top of a de&s;k. He places this box on one of the ends of the crib, in &s;uch a &s;ituation that the chickens may enter ea&s;ily, and walk round the three &s;ides at lea&s;t; he warms it below by means of a foot|&s;tove, which he refre&s;hes occa&s;ionally. The in|clination of the cover of this kind of de&s;k allows the chickens to place them&s;elves according to their different &s;izes; but as they have a practice, e&s;pecially when they are cold, of pre&s;&s;ing toge|ther, and even climbing on each other, and in this crowd the weak and &s;mall ones run the ri&s;k of being &s;mothered, this <HI>artificial mother</HI> is kept open at both ends, or rather both ends are co|vered with a net which the lea&s;t chicken can remove, &s;o as ea&s;ily to e&s;cape when it feels it&s;elf too much &s;queezed; and it can then, by going round to the other hole, chu&s;e a le&s;s dangerous place. Reamur endeavours to avoid even this inconvenience by another precaution, which is to keep the cover &s;loped &s;o low as to prevent the chickens from climbing on each other; and he rai&s;es it gradually as they grow. He improves &s;till on this idea, by dividing his large&s;t cribs into two, by means of a tran&s;ver&s;e partition, &s;o as to be able to &s;eparate the chickens of different &s;izes. He even places the cribs on wheels, that they may be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported; for they mu&s;t be brought into a chamber always in the even|ings,
<PB N="87" REF="95">
and even during the day-time when the weather is bad; and in winter this chamber mu&s;t be warmed. But when it is neither cold nor rainy, the cribs ought to be expo&s;ed to the open air and the &s;un, only taking the precau|tion of &s;heltering them from the wind. The doors may even be left open, and the chickens will &s;oon learn to come out to &s;crape the dung, or peck the tender gra&s;s, and return to their food, or to recover their warmth under their artificial mother. If we would not hazard their &s;auntering at will, we may place at the end of their crib an ordinary hen-crib, which, com|municating with the fir&s;t, will allow them a con|&s;iderable &s;pace to roam in, and at the &s;ame time prevent accidents.</P>
<P>But the more we confine them, the more re|gular we ought to be in giving them food. Be|&s;ides millet-&s;eeds, yolks of eggs, &s;oup, and crumbs of bread, young poultry are fond of rape-&s;eed, hemp-&s;eed, and other &s;mall grains of that kind; pea&s;e, beans, lentils, rice, &s;helled barley and oats, chopped turkey beans, and buck-wheat. It is proper, and even oeconomical, to bur&s;t mo&s;t of the&s;e in boiling water, before we offer them; the &s;aving amounts to a fifth on the wheat, two fifths on the barley, one half on the turkey beans, but is nothing on the oats and buck-wheat. It would even be a lo&s;s to &s;oak the barley; but this grain is what the chickens &s;hew the mo&s;t indif|ference for. La&s;tly, after they have grown, we

may give them every thing that we eat our&s;elves, except bitter almonds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ephemerides des Curieux de la Nature, Dec. 1. an. 8. ob&s;. 99.</BIBL></NOTE> and coffee-beans<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Two chickens being fed, the one on burnt coffee from the i&s;lands, the other on fre&s;h coffee, they both grew con&s;umptive and died, the one on the eighth day, and the other on the tenth, after having eaten three ounces of coffee.

bill and claws, to con&s;titute them real birds of prey.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be admitted, that poultry differ from birds of prey, no le&s;s by their mode of dige&s;tion and the &s;tructure of their &s;tomach, than by their bill and their nails. In the&s;e the &s;tomach is membranous, and dige&s;tion is effected by means of a &s;olvent, which varies in different &s;pecies, but the action of which is well a&s;cer|tained<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memories de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, an. 1752, p. 266.</BIBL></NOTE>; whereas the gallinaceous tribe may be con&s;idered as having three &s;tomachs; <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The craw, which is a kind of membranous bag, where the grains are fir&s;t macerated and be|gin to be reduced to a pap: 2. The wide&s;t part of the canal, lying between the craw and the gizzard, but neare&s;t the la&s;t; it is lined with a
<PB N="89" REF="97">
number of &s;mall glands, which furni&s;h a liquor that the food imbibes in its pa&s;&s;age: 3. La&s;tly, The gizzard, which yields a liquor that is mani|fe&s;tly acid, &s;ince the internal coat, being &s;oaked in water, becomes an excellent runnet for curd|ling milk. This third &s;tomach completes, by the powerful action of its mu&s;cles, what had only been begun in the two fir&s;t. The force of its fibres is greater than could be conceived; in le&s;s than four hours a ball of gla&s;s, which could &s;u&s;tain a pre&s;&s;ure of four pounds, is reduced to an im|palpable powder. In forty-eight hours, &s;everal tubes of gla&s;s, four lines in diameter and one line thick, were divided longitudinally into two kinds of rents; and, at the end of that time, all the &s;harp edges were ground down, and the po|li&s;h de&s;troyed, particularly on the convex part. The gizzard was al&s;o able to flatten tubes of tinned iron, and, in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, to cru&s;h &s;eventeen nuts; and this was effected by repeated compre&s;&s;ions and alternate attrition, the mechani&s;m of which it is difficult to perceive. Reaumur, who made &s;everal trials to di&s;cover it, never could di&s;tingui&s;h but once any con&s;iderable motions in that part. He &s;aw in a capon the gizzard, of which he had brought into view portions, contracting and &s;ink|ing, and again &s;welling; he ob&s;erved a kind of fle&s;hy chords which formed on the &s;urface, or ra|ther appeared to be forming, becau&s;e he made in|ci&s;ions between them which &s;eparated them; and
<PB N="90" REF="98">
all the&s;e motions appeared to be propagated in waves, and very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>What proves that, in gallinaceous birds, di|ge&s;tion is performed chiefly by the action of the mu&s;cles of the gizzard, and not by the power of any &s;olvent, is, that if one of the&s;e be made to &s;wallow a &s;mall lead tube, open at both ends, but &s;o thick as to re&s;i&s;t the compre&s;&s;ion of the giz|gard, and into which a grain of barley be intro|duced, the tube will be found in the &s;pace of two days to have lo&s;t con&s;iderably of its weight; but the grain inclo&s;ed, though it were boiled and &s;helled, will then be di&s;covered to be &s;omewhat &s;welled, but as little altered as if it had been left the &s;ame time in another place equally humid; whereas the &s;ame grain, and others that are much harder, if not protected by a tube, would be di|ge&s;ted in much le&s;s time.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance which may a&s;&s;i&s;t the action of the gizzard is, that birds keep the cavity as full as po&s;&s;ible, and thus the four mu&s;cles of which it con&s;i&s;ts are thrown into play. When grain is wanting, they cramb it with herbage, and even &s;mall flints, the hardne&s;s and rough|ne&s;s of which contribute to brui&s;e the grain again&s;t which they are ince&s;&s;antly rubbed. I &s;ay by their roughne&s;s; for, when they are poli&s;h|ed, they quickly pa&s;s through the body, and tho&s;e with rugged &s;urfaces only remain. They are the more numerous in the gizzard the &s;carcer the food is, and they continue in it a longer
<PB N="91" REF="99">
time than any other &s;ub&s;tance, whether dige&s;t|ible or indige&s;tible.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed that the inner coat of this &s;tomach is &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t the re|action of &s;o many hard bodies on which it con|&s;tantly grinds, if we con&s;ider that it is really very thick, and of a &s;ub&s;tance analogous to horn. Be|&s;ides, we know that bits of wood and leather, which are rubbed with an extremely hard pow|der to poli&s;h bodies, la&s;t for a very long time.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e that this membrane is renewed in the &s;ame manner as the callous &s;kin of labourers hands.</P>
<P>But though the &s;mall &s;tones may a&s;&s;i&s;t di|ge&s;tion, it is not a&s;&s;erted that the granivorous birds have a decided view in &s;wallowing them. Redi having &s;hut up two capons, with water and little pebbles for their food; they drank much water, and died; the one in twenty days, the other in twenty-four, and both of them with|out having &s;wallowed a &s;ingle &s;tone.

<P>The organs that are de&s;tined for re&s;piration, con&s;i&s;t of lungs, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the land ani|mals, with ten air cells, eight of which are with|in the brea&s;t, and communicate directly with the lungs; and two larger ones in the lower belly, and which communicate with the eight preced|ing. When in in&s;piration the thorax is dilated, the air enters by the larynx into the lungs, thence

into the eight upper air cells, which dilating in|hale that al&s;o of the two cells of the lower belly, and the&s;e &s;uffer a proportional collap&s;e.

But this is not the proper place to explain the mechani&s;m; it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that in tho&s;e birds which never fly, as the ca&s;&s;owary, the o&s;trich, &amp;c. and in tho&s;e that fly tardily, &s;uch as the gallinaceous tribe, the fourth cell on each &s;ide is the &s;malle&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour &s;ervir a l'Hi&s;toire les Animaux.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the&s;e differences in the &s;tructure nece&s;&s;ari|ly imply many others, not to &s;peak of the mem|branous tubes that are ob&s;erved in &s;ome birds. Duverney has &s;hewn, from an experiment made on a living cock, that the voice in the&s;e birds is formed not near the larynx, as in the quadru|peds, but below the <HI>trachea arteria,</HI> near the forking, at which place Perrault perceived an in|ternal larynx. Heri&s;&s;ant ob&s;erved, in the prin|cipal bronchial ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, &s;emilunar membranes placed tran&s;ver&s;ely one above ano|ther, in &s;uch a manner that they only occupied the half of the cavity of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and allow|ed
<PB N="93" REF="101">
the air a free pa&s;&s;age through the other half; and he ju&s;tly concludes, that the&s;e membranes mu&s;t contribute to the formation of the voice, though their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not &s;o e&s;&s;ential as that of the o&s;&s;eous coat of the cre&s;cent, which ter|minates a con&s;iderable cavity above the &s;uperior and internal part of the brea&s;t, and which has al&s;o &s;ome communication with the upper air cells. This anatomi&s;t affirms, that he has a&s;certained, by repeated trials, that if this coat be perforated, the voice is immediately impaired, and can be re&s;tored only by clo&s;ing the hole accurately to vent the e&s;cape of the air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, <HI>ann&eacute;e</HI> 1753, page 191.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving &s;uch wide differences in the conformation of the organs of the voice, will it not appear &s;ingular, that birds, with a tongue of cartilage, and lips of horn, &s;hould imitate our &s;ongs, and even our &s;peech, more ea&s;ily than tho&s;e among the quadrupeds that re&s;emble man the mo&s;t? So difficult it is to judge of the u&s;e of the parts from their mere &s;tructure, and &s;o true, that the modification of the voice and of &s;ounds depends almo&s;t entirely on the &s;en&s;ibility of the ear.</P>
<P>The inte&s;tinal canal is very long in the gal|linaceous tribe, and exceeds about five times that of the animal, reckoning from the point of the bill to the <HI>anus.</HI> We find two <HI>caeca,</HI> about &s;ix inches in length, which take their ri&s;e where the
<PB N="94" REF="102">
<HI>colon</HI> joins the <HI>ileon</HI>; the <HI>rectum</HI> widens towards its extremity, and forms a common receptacle, into which the &s;olid and fluid excrements are &s;eparately di&s;charged, and from which they are ejected together, though not intimately mixed. The organs characteri&s;tic of the &s;exes are al&s;o perceived; viz. in hens, the <HI>vulva</HI> or ori&s;ice of the <HI>oviductus,</HI> and in Cocks the two yards, that is, the paps of the two &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els.

<P>It was known in the time of Ari&s;totle, that the Cock had te&s;ticles concealed within its body. The ancients even a&s;cribed to this &s;ituation the fiery pa&s;&s;ion of the male for the female, who is le&s;s ardent, they alleged, becau&s;e the ovarium be|ing placed near the diaphragm, is more apt to be cooled by the acce&s;&s;ion of the air re&s;pired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;totle <HI>de Partibus Animalium,</HI> lib. iv. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>. But the te&s;ticles are not &s;o exclu&s;ively appro|priated to the male as not to be found in the fe|males of &s;ome &s;pecies of birds, as in the little bu&s;tard, and perhaps in the great bu&s;tard<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;toire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, <HI>ann&eacute;e</HI> 1756, p. 44.</BIBL></NOTE>. Sometimes the male has only one, but generally two; the bulk of the&s;e kinds of glands is far from being proportioned to that of the bird. In the eagle, they are only of the &s;ize of peas; in
<PB N="95" REF="103">
a Cock of four months old, they are as large as olives. The bulk varies not only between one &s;pecies and another, but between different indi|viduals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and is mo&s;t expanded in the &s;ea&s;on of love. But how diminutive &s;oever be their &s;ize, they produce mighty effects in the animal oeconomy, as is evinced by the wonder|ful changes effected by their extirpation. This operation is commonly performed when the bird is three or four months old. After ema&s;culation it grows plumper, and its fle&s;h becomes more juicy and delicate; and when &s;ubjected to a che|mical analy&s;is, yields different products from what it would have given before ca&s;tration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The extract of the lean of a capon is &s;omewhat le&s;s than the fortieth part of its total weight; whereas it amounts to one twelfth in a pullet, and rather more than one &s;eventh in a Cock.

Cocks, with di&s;dain by the females, deprived of all the appe|tites related to
generation, it is not only ex|cluded from the &s;ociety of its equals, but
ex|truded, as it were, from its &s;pecies. It is an idle &s;olitary out-ca&s;t,
all who&s;e powers are directed on it&s;elf, and who&s;e &s;ole object is its
individual <PB N="96" REF="104"> pre&s;ervation: to eat, to &s;leep, to fatten,
are its principal employments, and con&s;titute the &s;um of its wants. But, by
a little attention, we can draw advantage from its weakne&s;s, and even its
con&s;equent docility, by giving it u&s;eful habits. For in&s;tance, we can
teach it to rear and tend young chickens. For this purpo&s;e it mu&s;t be kept
&s;ome days in a dark place, only bringing it out at regular hours to feed, and
accu&s;toming it gradually to the &s;ight and company of a few chickens that
are pretty &s;tout; it will &s;oon con|tract a fondne&s;s for them, and will
lead them with as much affection and a&s;&s;iduity as their mother. It will
even conduct a greater number than a hen; for its wings &s;pread and afford
more &s;hel|ter; and the hen, freed from its toil and &s;oli|citude, will
&s;oon begin again to lay; and thus the capon, though condemned to &s;terility,
will &s;till contribute indirectly to the pre&s;ervation and multiplication of
its &s;pecies.</P>
<P>So great a change produced in the character of the capon, by a cau&s;e &s;o weak and apparently &s;o inadequate to the effect, is the more remark|able, as it is confirmed by an immen&s;e number of trials which men have made on other &s;pecies, and have even dared to extend to their brethren of the human race.</P>

<P>This is a kind of animal engrafting, the &s;uc|ce&s;s of which would appear very doubtful when fir&s;t tried, but from which, &s;ince the &s;ucce&s;s is known, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that no practical in|formation has been derived. In general, the de|&s;tructive experiments have been more &s;tudied, and pur&s;ued with more ardour, than tho&s;e which are directed to pre&s;ervation; becau&s;e man is fonder of plea&s;ure and expence, than the acqui|&s;ition of knowledge and the exerci&s;e of bene|ficence. Chickens are not hatched with that cre&s;t and tho&s;e reddi&s;h membranes which di&s;|tingui&s;h them from other birds. It is a month after they have left the &s;hell before the&s;e parts begin to unfold; at two months old, the young

Cocks crow, and fight with one another. They feel that they mu&s;t hate each other, though the &s;ource of their di&s;like has yet no exi&s;tence. It is commonly five or &s;ix months before they &s;hew any pa&s;&s;ion for the hens, and that the&s;e begin to lay. In both &s;exes, the complete term of their growth is a year, or fifteen months. The young hens, it is &s;aid, lay more; but the old ones are better &s;itters. This period of their growth would imply that the ordinary extent of their life does not exceed &s;even or eight years, if the &s;ame proportion &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in birds as in quadrupeds. But we have &s;een that this is much longer; a Cock will live twenty years in the dome&s;tic condition, and perhaps thirty years in the &s;tate of liberty. Unfortunately for them, we have no intere&s;t in &s;uffering them to reach to a great age. The hens and capons that are de&s;tined for the table, never enjoy above one year's exi&s;tence; and mo&s;t of them have only one &s;ea&s;on.

Aco&s;ta indeed maintains the oppo&s;ite opinion, that hens exi&s;ted in Peru before the arrival of the Spaniards; and alleges as a proof, that the natives call the bird, in their language, <HI>gualpa,</HI> and its egg <HI>ponto.</HI> But the antiquity of the word is not &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h that of the thing denoted; for it is ea&s;y to con|ceive, that &s;avages, the fir&s;t time they &s;aw a &s;trange bird, would naturally give it a name, either from its re&s;emblance to &s;ome bird with which they were acquainted, or from &s;ome other analogy. What would determine me in favour of the fir&s;t opinion is, the conformity to the law of the climate. This law, though it cannot be applied in general to birds, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are vigorous on the wing, and to which all countries are open, yet regulates tho&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="109">
which, like the poultry, being bulky and hav|ing an aver&s;ion to water, can neither waft their cour&s;e through the air like the birds that &s;oar, nor cro&s;s the &s;eas, nor even the large rivers, like the quadrupeds that &s;wim, and would therefore be for ever excluded, but for the inter|ference of man, from tho&s;e countries which are &s;eparated by an immen&s;e ocean. The Cock is then an animal which belongs peculiarly to the Ancient Continent, and ought to be added to the li&s;t that I have given, of all tho&s;e animals which exi&s;ted not in the New World before it was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In proportion as hens are removed from their native region, and accu&s;tomed to another cli|mate and different food, they mu&s;t &s;uffer &s;ome alteration in their &s;hape, or rather in the parts mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of change. Hence undoubt|edly tho&s;e varieties that con&s;titute the different breeds which I am to de&s;cribe; varieties which are con&s;tantly perpetuated in each climate, whe|ther from the continued action of the &s;ame cau&s;es that produced them at fir&s;t, or from the attention that is paid in matching the individuals &s;elected for propagation.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that we could here form, as in the ca&s;e of the dog, a kind of genealogical tree of all families of the Cock, which would point out the primitive &s;tock, and its different branches, and repre&s;ent the various orders of alterations and changes corre&s;ponding to its dif|ferent
<PB N="102" REF="110">
&s;tates. But this would require more ac|curate and more minute accounts than tho&s;e in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with giving my opinion in regard to the hen of our own climate, and &s;hall endeavour to exa|mine into it's origin; but previous to this inquiry, I &s;hall enumerate the foreign breeds that have been de&s;cribed by naturali&s;ts, or only mentioned by travellers.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Common Cock.</HI> That of our own climate.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Cre&s;ted Cock.</HI> It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Common Cock by a tuft of feathers ri&s;ing on the head, and by its comb, which is gene|rally &s;maller; probably becau&s;e the food, in|&s;tead of being &s;pent on the comb alone, is partly di&s;tributed to nouri&s;h the feathers. Some tra|vellers a&s;&s;ert that the Mexican poultry are cre&s;ted; the&s;e, as well as all the re&s;t on the con|tinent of America, have been introduced from the ancient continent. The breed of the cre&s;ted hens is that which the curious have mo&s;t culti|vated, and what generally happens when things are clo&s;ely examined, they have ob&s;erved a great number of differences, particularly in the co|lours of their plumage; which &s;erve to di&s;tin|gui&s;h a multitude of races, that are the more e&s;teemed in proportion to the beauty and rare|ne&s;s of their tints. Such are the gold and &s;ilver ones; the black-cre&s;ted white ones; the white|cre&s;ted black ones; the agate, the chamois, and
<PB N="103" REF="111">
the &s;laty; tho&s;e with fi&s;h-&s;cales, and the er|mined; the widow-hen, which has &s;mall white tears &s;prinkled on a &s;allow ground; the flame|coloured; the &s;tony &s;ort, who&s;e plumage has a white ground &s;potted with black, chamois, &s;laty, or golden, &amp;c. But I &s;u&s;pect that the&s;e differences are not &s;o invariable, or &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed, as to con&s;titute real di&s;tinct &s;pecies, as &s;ome curious people pretend, who a&s;&s;ert that many of the above breeds never intermix.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Wild Cock of A&s;ia.</HI> This is undoubt|edly what approaches the neare&s;t to the original &s;tock of our common kind; for never being fet|tered by man, or thwarted in the choice of its food or mode of life, what could ever alter its native purity? It is neither the large&s;t nor the &s;malle&s;t of its &s;pecies, but is intermediate between the extremes. It is found, as we have already ob&s;erved, in many countries of A&s;ia, in Africa, and in the Cape de Verd i&s;lands. We have no de&s;cription of it &s;o complete as to enable us to compare it with our Cock. I mu&s;t here recom|mend to travellers who have an opportunity of &s;eeing this wild breed, to inquire if they con|&s;truct ne&s;ts, and in what manner. Lottinger, phy&s;ician of Stra&s;burg, who has made many important ob&s;ervations on birds, informs me, that our hens, when left to them&s;elves, build ne&s;ts, and with as much care as the par|tridges.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="104" REF="112">
4. <HI>The Acoho,</HI> or <HI>Madaga&s;car Cock.</HI> This &s;pecies is very &s;mall, and the eggs &s;till le&s;s in proportion, for the birds can hatch thirty at a time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;toire Generale des Voyages, tom. viii.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Dwarf Hen of Java.</HI> It is of the &s;ize of a pigeon<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Collection Academique, partie etrangere, tom. iii.</BIBL></NOTE>; probably the Little Engli&s;h Hen, which is &s;till &s;maller than the Dwarf Hen of France, is of the &s;ame kind. We may, per|haps, add the Small Hen of Pegu, which tra|vellers de&s;cribe as not larger than a middle-&s;ized turtle; its feet &s;caly, and its plumage beau|tiful.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Hen of the I&s;thmus of Darien.</HI> It is &s;maller than the common &s;ort; has a circle of feathers round its legs, an exceeding thick tail, which it carries erect, and it crows before break|of-day.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Cambogia Hens.</HI> Carried by the Spaniards from that kingdom into the Philippines. Their feet are &s;o &s;hort that their wings trail on the ground. It is very like the Dwarf Hen of France, or perhaps that Dwarf Hen that is reared in Britanny, on account of its fecundity, and which con&s;tantly hops in its gait.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>The Bantam Cock.</HI> It has much re&s;em|blance to the Rough-footed Cock of France. Its feet are covered with feathers, but only on the
<PB N="105" REF="113">
out&s;ide. The plumage of the legs is very long, and forms a &s;ort of boots which reach a con&s;i|derable way beyond the claws. It is courageous, and re&s;olutely fights with one &s;tronger than it&s;elf. Its iris is red. I have been informed that mo&s;t of this breed have no tuft. There is a large kind of rough-footed Cocks that comes from England, and another &s;maller, termed the <HI>Engli&s;h Dwarf Cock</HI>; which is of a fine gold colour, with a double comb.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another &s;ort of dwarfs, which exceeds not the &s;ize of a common pigeon, and who&s;e plumage is &s;ometimes white, &s;ometimes mixed with white and gold colour.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Dutch &s;peak of another kind of Cocks peculiar to the i&s;land of Java, where they are &s;eldom reated but for fighting; they call it the <HI>Half-Hen of Java.</HI> According to Willoughby, it carries its tail nearly like the turkey. To this family we mu&s;t refer tho&s;e &s;ingular hens of Java, mentioned by Mande&s;lo, which re&s;emble the common and Indian kinds, and that fight de&s;|perately with each other like cocks. The Sieur Fournier informs me, that one of this &s;pecies is &s;till living at Paris; it has, according to him, neither comb nor ruff; the head is &s;imple like that of the phea&s;ant. This hen is very high on its legs; its tail is long and pointed, and the feathers of unequal length; and in general, the colour of the feathers is auburn, like tho&s;e of the vulture.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="106" REF="114">
10. <HI>The Engli&s;h Cock</HI> is not larger than the Dwarf Cock, but is much taller than our Common Cock, and this is what principally di&s;tingui&s;hes it. We may al&s;o cla&s;s with it the <HI>Xolo</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gemelli Carreri.</NOTE>, a kind of Philippine Cock, which has very long legs. Be&s;ides the Engli&s;h Cock excels the French in fighting; it has rather a tuft than a cre&s;t; its neck and bill are more &s;lender; and above the no&s;trils there are two fle&s;hy protuberances, which are red like the comb.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>The Turki&s;h Cock</HI> is remarkable only for its fine plumage.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>The Hamburgh Cock,</HI> named al&s;o <HI>the Vel|vet Breeches,</HI> becau&s;e its thighs and belly are of a &s;oft black. Its demeanour is grave and &s;tate|ly; its iris is yellow, and its eyes are encircled with a ring of brown feathers, from which ri&s;es a black tuft that covers the ears. There are other feathers nearly like the&s;e behind the comb and beneath the barbils, and broad round black &s;pots on the brea&s;t. His legs and feet are of a lead colour, excepting the &s;ole of the foot, which is yellowi&s;h.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>The Frizzled Cock,</HI> who&s;e feathers have a rever&s;ed po&s;ition. They are found in Java, Japan, and the whole of the &s;outh of A&s;ia. This bird belongs more peculiarly to the warm coun|tries; for chickens of this breed are extremely &s;en&s;ible to cold, and can hardly &s;upport that
<PB N="107" REF="115">
of our climate. The Sieur Fournier a&s;&s;ures me, that their plumage a&s;&s;umes all &s;orts of colours, white, black, &s;ilvery, golden, and &s;late tints.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>The Silky Hen of Japan.</HI> The feathers are white, and their webs are parted, and pretty much re&s;emble hair. Its feet are clothed with plumage on the out&s;ide, as far as the nail of the outer toe. This breed is found in Japan, China, and in &s;ome other countries of A&s;ia. To propagate it in all its purity, requires that both the parents be covered with down.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>The Negro Cock</HI> has its comb, barbils, epi|dermis, and perio&s;teum ab&s;olutely black. Its plumage al&s;o is generally black, but &s;ometimes white. It is found in the Philippines, in Java, Delhi, and at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands. Becman affirms that mo&s;t of the birds in the la&s;t mentioned place have bones as black as jet, and a &s;kin black like that of a negroe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier.</NOTE>. If this fact be true, we mu&s;t impute it to the tinging quality of their food. We know the effects of madder, and other plants of that genus, and we are informed, that in England the veal is whiten|ed by feeding the calves with grain and other &s;oft aliments, mixed with a certain earth or chalk found in the county of Bedford<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Journal Economique, <HI>Mai</HI> 1754.</BIBL></NOTE>. It would therefore be curious to di&s;cover at St. Jago, among the different &s;ub&s;tances which the&s;e birds eat, that which tinges the <HI>perio&s;teum</HI> black. This negroe hen is al&s;o known in France, and pro|pagates
<PB N="108" REF="116">
there; but as its fle&s;h, after being dre&s;&s;ed, is black and unpalatable, it is not likely that the race will be multiplied. When it cro&s;&s;es the breed with others, varieties of different colours are produced, but which commonly retain the comb and the ruffs, or black barbils; and even the membrane that forms the little ear is tinged with a blacki&s;h hue on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>The Rumple&s;s Cock,</HI> or <HI>the Per&s;ian Cock</HI> of &s;ome authors. Mo&s;t of the hens and Cocks in Virginia have no rump, and yet they are un|doubtedly of the Engli&s;h breed. The inhabi|tants of that colony affirm, that when the&s;e birds are imported, they &s;oon lo&s;e the rump<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for 1693, No. 206.</BIBL></NOTE>. If this be admitted as a fact, the variety in que&s;tion ought to be called <HI>Virginian,</HI> and not <HI>Per&s;ian Cocks</HI>; e&s;pecially as they were unknown to the ancients, and the moderns have not noticed them till after the di&s;covery of America. We have mentioned that the European dogs, which have pendulous ears, lo&s;e their voice, and that their ears become erect, when they are carried into tropical climates. This &s;ingular change, pro|duced by the exce&s;&s;ive heat of tho&s;e torrid re|gions, is not however &s;o great as the lo&s;s of the rump and tail in the gallinaceous tribe. But it appears to me much more curious, that as the&s;e two tribes of animals are the mo&s;t dome&s;tic of all, and therefore the wide&s;t removed from their
<PB N="109" REF="117">
natural condition, &s;o there is breed of dogs with|out a tail, as there is of Cocks without a rump. Several years ago, I was &s;hewn one of the&s;e dogs that had been whelped without a tail, but which I then conceived to be a degraded individual, a mon&s;ter; and for that rea&s;on I took no notice of it in the hi&s;tory of the canine genus. I have again con&s;idered the &s;ubject, and I am now con|fident that it is a con&s;tant and invariable race, like that of the Rumple&s;s Cock. This breed of Cocks has a blue bill and feet; a &s;ingle or double comb, but no cre&s;t; the plumage is variegated with all the colours; and the Sieur Fournier a&s;&s;ures me, that when it couples with the ordinary kind, a half-rumped &s;ort are produced, with &s;ix feathers in the tail in&s;tead of twelve.&mdash;This may be true, but I can hardly believe it.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>The Hen with five toes</HI> is, as we have &s;aid, a powerful objection to the &s;y&s;tem of cla&s;&s;ifica|tion founded on the number of toes. This kind has five on each foot, three before and two be|hind; there are even &s;ome individuals that have &s;ix.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>The Hens of San&s;evara.</HI> The eggs of this &s;ort are &s;old in Per&s;ia for three or four crowns a-piece; and the Per&s;ians amu&s;e them&s;elves in &s;triking them again&s;t one another, as a kind of play. In that country there are al&s;o Cocks much more beautiful and larger, which are &s;old &s;o high as 300 crowns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tavernier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="110" REF="118">
19. <HI>The Cock of Caux,</HI> or of <HI>Padua.</HI> Its di&s;tin|gui&s;hing character is its magnitude. Its comb is often double, and in the &s;hape of a crown; and there is a kind of tuft, which is more con&s;picu|ous in the hens. Their voice is &s;trong, hollow, raucous, and their weight is from eight to ten pounds. To this fine breed we may refer the large Cocks of Rhodes, Per&s;ia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chardin.</NOTE>, Pegu<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Recueil des Voyages qui ont &s;ervi &agrave; l'Etabli&s;&s;ement de la Com|pagnie des Indes, <HI>tome</HI> iii. p. 71.</BIBL></NOTE>, the bulky hens of Bahia, which do not begin to be covered with feathers till they have attained half their &s;ize<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dampier's New Voyage.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that a great number of birds, mentioned by travellers by the names of Cock and Hen, are of a quite different &s;pecies.

the hen of Damietta, which has a red bill and feet, a &s;mall &s;pot on the head of the &s;ame colour, and plumage of a violet blue, and which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a great water-fowl; the hen of the Delta, the rich colours of who&s;e plumage Thevenot extols, but which differs from the common &s;ort, not only by the &s;hape of its bill and tail, but by its natural habits, &s;ince it is fond of mar&s;hes; the Pharaoh hen, which the &s;ame traveller affirms is not inferior to a fat hazel grous; the hens of Corea, which have a tail three feet long, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the immen&s;e number of different breeds of the gallinaceous tribe, how &s;hall we deter|mine the original &s;tock? So many circum&s;tances have operated, &s;o many accidents have con|curred; the attention, and even the whim of man have &s;o much multiplied the varieties, that it appears extremely difficult to trace them to their &s;ource. The Wild Cocks found in the warm countries of A&s;ia may indeed be con&s;idered as the primeval &s;tem in tho&s;e regions. But as in our temperate climates there is no wild bird that perfectly re&s;embles the Dome&s;tic Cock, we are at a lo&s;s on which of the varieties to confer the priority. The phea&s;ant, the grous, the wood|hen, are the only birds in the &s;tate of nature which are analogous to our poultry; but it is uncertain if they would ever intermix, and have prolific progeny; and they have con&s;ti|tuted di&s;tinct and &s;eparate &s;pecies from the mo&s;t
<PB N="112" REF="120">
remote times. Be&s;ides, they want the combs, the &s;purs, and the pendulous membranes of the gallinaceous tribe. If we exclude all the fo|reign and wild kinds, we &s;hall greatly dimini&s;h the number of varieties, and the differences will be found to be &s;light. The hens of Caux are al|mo&s;t double the bulk of the ordinary &s;ort; the Engli&s;h Cock, though exactly like the French, has much longer legs and feet; others differ on|ly in the length of their feathers; others in the number of their toes; others are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the beauty and &s;ingularity of their colours, as the Turki&s;h and Hamburgh hen: and of the&s;e &s;ix varieties, to which the common breed may be reduced, three are to be a&s;cribed to the in|fluence of the climate; that of Hamburgh, that of Turkey, and that of England; perhaps al&s;o the fourth and fifth, for the hen of Caux mo&s;t probably came from Italy, &s;ince it is al&s;o called the <HI>hen of Padua,</HI> and the hen with five toes was known in Italy in the time of Columella. Thus there only remain the Common Cock and the Cre&s;ted Cock as the natural breed of our country, and even in the&s;e the two &s;exes admit of all the variety of colour. The con&s;tant cha|racter of the tuft &s;eems to mark an improved &s;pecies; that is, one better kept and better fed; and con&s;equently the common breed, which has no tuft, mu&s;t be the true parent of our poultry. It would appear that the primitive colour was white, and that all the intermediate &s;hades be|tween
<PB N="113" REF="121">
it and black were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a&s;&s;umed. What &s;eems to corroborate this conjecture is, an analogy which no per&s;on has yet remarked, that the colour of the egg generally re&s;embles that of the plumage of the bird. Thus a raven's eggs are of a green brown, &s;potted with black; tho&s;e of the ke&s;tril are red; tho&s;e of the ca&s;&s;owary dark green; tho&s;e of the black crow are of a &s;till duller brown than tho&s;e of the raven; tho&s;e of the variegated magpie are al&s;o variegated and &s;potted; tho&s;e of the great cinereous &s;hrike, &s;pot|ted with grey; tho&s;e of the woodchat, &s;potted with red; tho&s;e of the goat&s;ucker, mottled with blui&s;h and brown &s;pots on a cloudy whiti&s;h ground; tho&s;e of the &s;parrow, cinereous entire|ly, covered with che&s;nut &s;pots on a grey ground; tho&s;e of the blackbird, blacki&s;h blue; tho&s;e of the grous, whiti&s;h &s;potted with yellow; tho&s;e of the pintados, &s;peckled like their plumage, with white round &s;pots, &amp;c. In &s;hort, there &s;eems to be an invariable relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the colour of the egg and that of the plumage. The tints are indeed much more dilute on the eggs, and in mo&s;t of them the white predomi|nates; but white is al&s;o in mo&s;t ca&s;es the pre|vailing colour of the plumage, e&s;pecially in fe|males: and &s;ince hens of all colours, white, black, grey, tawney, and mottled, have white eggs, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that if they had remained in the &s;tate of nature, white would at lea&s;t have predominated in their plumage.

<PB N="116" REF="125">
loo&s;ely over a third part of the neck, which at fir&s;t &s;ight appears &s;ingle; but when examined is found to be compo&s;ed of a double membrane. A fle&s;hy protuberance, of a conical &s;hape and furrowed with deep tran&s;ver&s;e wrinkles, ri&s;es from the bottom of the upper mandible. This protuberance is &s;carcely more than an inch long in its natural &s;tate of contraction; that is, when the Turkey, &s;eeing no objects but tho&s;e to which it is accu&s;tomed, and feeling no inward agita|tion, walks calmly &s;eeking its food. But, on any unu&s;ual appearance, e&s;pecially in the &s;ea&s;on of love, this bird, which in its ordinary &s;tate is humble and tame, &s;wells with in&s;tant rage; its head and neck become inflated, the conical pro|tuberance expands, and de&s;cends two or three inches lower than the bill, which it entirely co|vers. All the&s;e fle&s;hy parts a&s;&s;ume at the &s;ame time a deeper red; it bri&s;tles up the feathers on its neck and back, &s;preads its tail like a fan, while its wings drop and even trail on the ground. In this attitude, he &s;ometimes &s;truts around his fe|male, making a dull &s;ound, produced by the air e&s;caping from the brea&s;t through the bill, and followed by a long gabbling noi&s;e. Sometimes he leaves his female to attack tho&s;e who di&s;turb him. In both the&s;e ca&s;es, his motions are compo&s;ed; but they become rapid the in&s;tant he utters the dull &s;ound which we have mention|ed. He vents a &s;hrill &s;cream, which every body knows, which intermits from time to time, and
<PB N="117" REF="126">
which he may be made to repeat as often as one choo&s;es, by whi&s;tling, or by forming any &s;harp tones. He then begins again to wheel round, which action, according as it is directed to his fe|male, or pointed at the object that has provoked his di&s;plea&s;ure, expre&s;&s;es attachment or marks rage: and it is ob&s;erved, that his fits are the mo&s;t vio|lent at the &s;ight of red clothes; he is then in|flamed and becomes furious; ru&s;hes on the per|&s;on, &s;trikes with his bill, and exerts him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to remove an object who&s;e pre&s;ence he cannot endure.</P>
<P>It is a curious and very &s;ingular fact, that the conical caruncle, which lengthens and is relaxed when the bird is agitated by the violence of pa&s;|&s;ion, is relaxed in the &s;ame manner after death.</P>
<P>Some Turkies are white, others variegated with black and white, others with white and ru&s;ty yellow, others are of an uniform grey, which are the mo&s;t uncommon of all. But in the greater number the plumage verges on black, with a little white near the ends of the feathers: tho&s;e which cover the back and the upper &s;ur|face of the wings are &s;quare at the extremities; and among tho&s;e of the rump, and even of the brea&s;t, there are &s;ome with rainbow colours, oc|ca&s;ioned by the different rays being reflected according to the various degrees of incidence. As they grow older the tints become more glo&s;&s;y, and the reflections more diver&s;ified. Many people imagine that white Turkies are the hardi|e&s;t;
<PB N="118" REF="127">
and, for this rea&s;on, that breed is preferred in &s;ome provinces: there are numerous flocks in Pertois in Champaign.</P>
<P>The naturali&s;ts have reckoned twenty-eight quills in each wing, and eighteen in the tail. But what is much more &s;triking, and what will readily di&s;tingui&s;h this &s;pecies from any other yet known, is a lock of hard black hair, five or &s;ix inches long, which, in our temperate cli|mates, ri&s;es from the lower part of the neck in the grown male Turkey on the &s;econd year, and &s;ometimes about the end of the fir&s;t; and before it appears, the place where it emerges is marked by a fle&s;hy prominence. Linnaeus &s;ays, that this hair does not &s;prout till the third year in the Turkeys bred in Sweden. If the fact be certain, it would follow that this production is the &s;lower in proportion to the rigour of the climate; and indeed one of the principal effects of cold is, to check every &s;ort of growth. This lock of hair is the foundation of the epithet of bearded, <HI>(pectore barbato,)</HI> which has been ap|plied to the Turkey; an expre&s;&s;ion in every re&s;pect improper, for it does not grow from the brea&s;t, but from the lower part of the neck; and, be&s;ides, it is not &s;ufficient that there are hairs; they ought never to receive the name of beard, unle&s;s they ri&s;e from the chin, as in Edwards's bearded vulture.</P>
<P>We &s;hould form an inaccurate idea of the tail of the Turkey-cock, if we imagined that all the
<PB N="119" REF="128">
feathers of which it is compo&s;ed can equally be &s;pread like a fan. In fact, he has two tails, an upper and an under one; the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen broad feathers in&s;erted round the rump, and which are erected when the bird &s;truts about; the &s;econd, or lower one, is formed of others which are not &s;o broad, and remains always in a horizontal po&s;ition. The male is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;pur on each foot, which is of various lengths, but always &s;horter and &s;ofter than in common cocks.</P>
<P>IN the female, not only the &s;purs, and the lock of hair hanging from the lower part of the neck, are wanting, but al&s;o the conical caruncle is &s;horter, and admits of no exten&s;ion; both this caruncle barbil, and the glandulous fle&s;h that &s;heaths the head, are of a paler red; &s;he is &s;maller al&s;o, and has le&s;s expre&s;&s;ion, le&s;s re&s;olution, and le&s;s vigour of action; her cry is only a plaintive accent; &s;he never &s;tirs but to &s;eek food or to fly before danger: finally, &s;he cannot perform the &s;trutting evolutions, not becau&s;e &s;he has not the double tail of the male, but on account of the want of the <HI>elevator</HI> mu&s;cles which erect the very large feathers that compo&s;e the upper fan.</P>
<P>In the male, as in the female, the no&s;trils are &s;ituated in the upper mandible; the ears are placed behind the eyes, thickly covered, and, as it were, darkened by a multitude of little divided feathers, pointed in different directions.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="129">
It will readily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the be&s;t Cock is the &s;tronge&s;t, the livelie&s;t, and the mo&s;t vigorous in all his movements. Five or &s;ix females may be entru&s;ted to his care. If there are &s;everal males, they will fight with each other, but not with the furious ob&s;tinacy of or|dinary cocks; the&s;e even attack Turkies which are double their &s;ize, and kill them in the com|bat. The &s;ubjects of the contention are equally compliant to the males of both &s;pecies, if, as Sperling &s;ays, the Turkey-cock, when deprived of his females, pays his addre&s;&s;es to the com|mon hens; and the Turkey-hens, in the ab|&s;ence of their males, offer their favours to the ordinary cock, and eagerly &s;olicit his potent embrace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Zoologia Phy&s;ica, p. 367.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The battles which the Turkey-cocks fight among them&s;elves are far le&s;s vigorous; the van|qui&s;hed does not always fly from the field of battle, and &s;ometimes he is even preferred by the females. It has been ob&s;erved, that though a white Turkey was beat by a black one, all the chickens were white.</P>
<P>The Turkies perform copulation nearly in the &s;ame way as ordinary cocks, only it la&s;ts longer. Hence, perhaps, the rea&s;on that the male is not equal to &s;o many females, and is &s;ooner worn out. I have already mentioned, on the authority of Sperling, that he &s;ometimes
<PB N="121" REF="130">
mixes with common hens; the &s;ame author a&s;&s;erts, that when his females are taken from him, he not only couples with the pea-hen (which may happen), but al&s;o with the ducks (which &s;eems to me to be le&s;s probable).</P>
<P>The Turkey-hen is not &s;o prolific as the com|mon hen. She mu&s;t, from time to time, be fed with hemp-&s;eed, oats, and buck-wheat, to make her lay: and after all, &s;he &s;eldom has more than one hatch of fifteen eggs a-year. When &s;he has two, which is very uncommon, the fir&s;t is about the end of winter, and the &s;econd in the month of Augu&s;t. The eggs are white, with &s;ome &s;mall &s;pots of reddi&s;h-yellow; and their &s;tructure is nearly the &s;ame as in tho&s;e of the common hen. The Turkey-hen will al&s;o hatch the eggs of all &s;orts of birds. We may know when &s;he wants to &s;it, for &s;he remains in the ne&s;t; and in order to fix her attachment, the place mu&s;t be dry, with a good a&s;pect, ac|cording to the &s;ea&s;on, and not too much ex|po&s;ed; for in&s;tinct leads her to conceal her&s;elf with the greate&s;t care when &s;he covers.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of a year old are generally the be&s;t &s;itters, and they are &s;o intent, that they would die upon their eggs from mere inanition, if we were not at pains to remove them once a-day, and give them food and drink. This pa&s;&s;ion for hatching is &s;o powerful and &s;o du|rable, that they &s;ometimes have two ne&s;ts in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, without the lea&s;t interruption; but, in
<PB N="122" REF="131">
&s;uch ca&s;es, they mu&s;t be &s;upported by richer food. The cock has a very oppo&s;ite in&s;tinct; for if he &s;ees the female covering, he breaks the eggs, which he regards, probably, as an ob|&s;tacle to his plea&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sperling. <HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; and for this rea&s;on it is, perhaps, that the female is &s;o indu&s;trious in concealing her ne&s;t.</P>
<P>After the full time, when the young Turkies are about to bur&s;t into day, they pierce with their bill the &s;hell of the egg in which they are inclo&s;ed; but it is &s;ometimes &s;o hard, that they would peri&s;h if not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by cru&s;hing it; and this mu&s;t be effected with great caution, following as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible the natural proce&s;s. If roughly handled in their tender moments, if &s;uffered to endure hunger, or if expo&s;ed to in|clement weather, though they may &s;urvive for the time, they will pine away and &s;oon peri&s;h. Cold, rain, and even dew, occa&s;ions lingering &s;ickne&s;s; the rays of a bright &s;un &s;trike them with in&s;tant death; and &s;ometimes they are cru&s;hed even under the feet of their mother: &s;uch are the dangers which threaten the life of this delicate bird. This cau&s;e, joined to the inferior fecundity of the Turkey-hens in Eu|rope, is the rea&s;on why this &s;pecies is much le&s;s numerous than that of the common poultry.</P>
<P>After their extrication from the &s;hell, the young Turkies ought to be kept in a warm and
<PB N="123" REF="132">
dry place, where there is &s;pread a broad layer of dung well trodden; and when we would bring them out into the open air, we &s;hould do it by degrees, and chu&s;e the fine&s;t days.</P>
<P>The young Turkies in&s;tinctively prefer pick|ing out of the hand, to feeding in any other way. We judge by their chirping when they want to eat, which is frequent. They ought to be pre&s;ented with food four or five times a-day; their fir&s;t nouri&s;hment &s;hould be wine and water, which mu&s;t be blown into their bill, and afterwards a few crumbs of bread may be mixed with it. On the fourth day, eggs &s;poiled in hatching may be given, beat up with bits of bread; and the&s;e addled eggs, whether they be hens or Turkies, are found to afford a &s;alutary nouri&s;hment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Journal Economique, <HI>A&ocirc;ut</HI> 1757, p. 69-73.</BIBL></NOTE>. Towards the tenth or twelfth day, the eggs are omitted, and in their &s;tead are u&s;ed chopped nettles mixed with millet, or with the flour of Turkey beans, of barley, of wheat, or of buck-wheat; or at lea&s;t, if we would &s;ave the grain without hurting the brood, with curdled milk, burdock, a little &s;tinking camomile, nettle-&s;eed, and bran. Afterwards, it will be &s;ufficient to give them all &s;orts of decayed fruits cut into bits<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Id. ibidem.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, e&s;pecially the berries of brambles and of white mulberries, &amp;c. When we perceive them having a langui&s;hing appear|ance,
<PB N="124" REF="133">
we mu&s;t dip their bills into wine, to make them drink a little, and at the &s;ame time oblige them to &s;wallow a grain of pepper. Sometimes they appear benumbed and motionle&s;s, when they have been overtaken by a cold rain; and they would infallibly die, if we were not careful to wrap them in warm rags, and blow repeatedly into them warm air through their bill. They mu&s;t be vi&s;ited from time to time to pierce the &s;mall bladders that collect under the tongue and about the rump, and to give them ru&s;t-water; it is even recommended to bathe their head with this water, to prevent certain di&s;ea&s;es to which they are &s;ubject; but in that ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be wiped and dried very carefully; for it is well known that humidity of every kind is hurtful to Turkies in their tender age.</P>
<P>The mother leads them with the &s;ame &s;olici|tude that the hen leads her chickens; &s;he warms them under her wings with the &s;ame affection, and protects them with the &s;ame courage. It would &s;eem that tenderne&s;s for her offspring gives quickne&s;s to her &s;ight; &s;he de&s;cries a bird of prey at a prodigious di&s;tance, when it is yet invi&s;ible to every other eye. As &s;oon as &s;he perceives her dreaded enemy, &s;he vents her fears by a &s;cream that &s;preads terror through the whole brood; each little Turkey &s;eeks refuge under a bu&s;h, or &s;quats in the herbage, and the mother keeps them in that &s;ituation by her cries
<PB N="125" REF="134">
&s;o long as danger is impending; but when her apprehen&s;ions are removed, &s;he informs them by a different note, and calls them from their concealments to a&s;&s;emble round her.</P>
<P>When the Turkies are newly hatched their head is &s;haded with a kind of down, but they have &s;till no glandulous fle&s;h or barbils. It requires &s;ix weeks or two months till the&s;e parts develope, or, as it is vulgarly &s;aid, before the Turkies <HI>put forth the red</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pou&s;&s;er le rouge.</HI></NOTE>. This is as critical a period with them as that of dentition is with children; and then e&s;pecially wine ought to be mixed with their ordinary food to &s;trengthen them. A &s;hort while before this they have begun to perch.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom that Turkies are &s;ubjected to ca&s;tration as ordinary cocks are; they fatten very well without &s;uffering that operation, and their fle&s;h is no le&s;s delicate: another proof that their temperament is not &s;o hot as that of com|mon poultry.</P>
<P>When they have grown hardy, they leave their mother, or rather they are abandoned by her. The more tender and delicate they were in their infancy, they become in time the more robu&s;t and the more capable of &s;upporting the inclemency of the weather. They are fond of perching in open air, and thus pa&s;s whole nights in the rigours of winter; &s;ometimes re&s;ting on
<PB N="126" REF="135">
one foot and drawing up the other to keep it warm, as it were, under the ventral feathers; at other times, on the contrary, crouching on the branch, and keeping their bodies in equi|librium. They lay their head under the wing when they go to &s;leep, and, during their re|po&s;e, the motion of re&s;piration is very percep|tible.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way of training Turkies after they are grown &s;tout is, to allow them to ramble in the fields where nettles, and other plants which they are fond of, are plentiful, or to admit them into the orchards when the fruit begins to drop, &amp;c. But we mu&s;t be attentive to re&s;train them from tho&s;e pa&s;tures that bear plants hurtful to them, &s;uch as the great fox|glove with red flowers; this plant is a real poi&s;on to Turkies; tho&s;e that eat it are thrown into a kind of intoxication, vertigoes, and con|vul&s;ions, and when the quantity is large they langui&s;h and die. We cannot therefore be too careful in extirpating this noxious plant from tho&s;e places where Turkies are rai&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;toire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences des Paris, <HI>ann&eacute;e</HI> 1748, p. 84.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>We &s;hould al&s;o be careful, e&s;pecially in their early infancy, not to &s;uffer them to go abroad in the morning till the &s;un has dried the dew, and to &s;hut them up before the fall of the evening damps; they mu&s;t likewi&s;e be confined
<PB N="127" REF="136">
in the &s;hade during the violent heats of the &s;um|mer's day. Each evening, when they return to roo&s;t, they mu&s;t be fed on pa&s;te of grain, or on &s;ome other food, except in harve&s;t, when they have gathered enough in the fields. As they are extremely timid, they are ea&s;ily led: the very &s;hadow of a &s;witch is &s;ufficient to drive large flocks, and they will often run from an animal that is much &s;maller and much weaker than them&s;elves. There are occa&s;ions, how|ever, when they di&s;cover courage, e&s;pecially in their defence again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of pole-cats, and other foes of the poultry. Sometimes even they &s;urround a hare in his &s;eat, and &s;trive to kill him by &s;triking with their bill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They have different tones, and different in|flexions of voice, according to their age, their &s;ex, and the various pa&s;&s;ions by which they are influenced; their pace is &s;low, their flight tardy; they drink, eat, and &s;wallow &s;mall pebbles nearly as the cocks do, and have al&s;o a double &s;tomach, that is, a craw and a gizzard; but, as they are much larger, the mu&s;cles of the gizzard are al&s;o much &s;tronger.</P>
<P>The length of the inte&s;tines is nearly qua|druple that of the bird, reckoning from the tip of the bill to the end of the rump; they have two <HI>caeca,</HI> both turned forwards, and which, taken together, con&s;titute more than a fourth of

the whole alimentary canal; the&s;e take their ri&s;e near the extremity, and the excrements contained in their cavity differ but little from tho&s;e included within the <HI>colon</HI> and <HI>rectum</HI>; the&s;e excrements do not remain at all in the common <HI>cloaca,</HI> as the urine, and that white &s;ediment which is always found where the urine pa&s;&s;es, and they have con&s;i&s;tence enough to receive &s;hape in their extru&s;ion from the <HI>anus.</HI></P>
<P>The parts of generation are nearly the &s;ame in Turkies as in common cocks; but they &s;eem to be much le&s;s vigorous in their performance. The males are not &s;o ardent for the females; their embraces are le&s;s frequent and le&s;s expedi|tious; and the females, at lea&s;t in our climate, lay much later, and have much fewer eggs.</P>
<P>As the eyes of birds have in &s;ome re&s;pects a different organization from tho&s;e of man and of quadrupeds, it may be proper to mention the chief di&s;tinctions. Be&s;ides the upper and under eye-lids, the Turkies, as well as mo&s;t other birds, have &s;till a third, called the internal eye-lid, <HI>membrana nictitans,</HI> which draws it&s;elf back into the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent in the large angle of the eye, and who&s;e quick and frequent twink|lings are effected by a curious mu&s;cular con|trivance. The upper eye-lid is almo&s;t entirely immoveable, but the lower can &s;hut the eye by ri&s;ing to the upper, which &s;carcely ever hap|pens, except when the animal is a&s;leep. The&s;e two eye-lids have each a lachrymal point, but

no cartilaginous margins; the <HI>cornea</HI> is tran&s;|parent, encircled by an o&s;&s;eous ring, con&s;i&s;ting of about fifteen &s;cales over-lapping each other like the tiles of a roof.

However this may be, certain it is, that the organ of &s;ight is more complex in birds than in quadrupeds; and as we have before &s;hewn that this &s;en&s;e is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the feathered race in a higher degree than what obtains in other animals, we mu&s;t

<P>If we compare the relations of travellers, we cannot he&s;itate to conclude, that Turkies are na|tives of America and of the adjacent i&s;lands; and that before the di&s;covery of the New Conti|nent, there exi&s;ted none in the Old.</P>

<P>I will not di&s;&s;emble, that Aldrovandus, Ge&s;|ner, Belon, and Ray, have affirmed that Turkies were natives of Africa or of the Ea&s;t Indies; and though their opinion on this &s;ubject is at pre&s;ent little regarded, I conceive that it is a duty which I owe to the&s;e great names not to reject it with|out &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">
Aldrovandus has attempted to prove at great length, that Turkies are the <HI>Meleagrides</HI> of the ancients, or the African or Numidian Hens, who&s;e plumage was covered with round &s;pots, like drops <HI>(Gallinae Numidicae guttatae)</HI>; but it is evi|dent, and every body is now agreed on the &s;ub|ject, that the&s;e are really our <HI>pintados,</HI> which in|deed come from-Africa, but which are quite different from Turkies. It would therefore be needle&s;s to dwell more particularly on the opi|nion of Aldrovandus, which in fact carries its refutation along with it; and yet Linnaeus &s;eems inclined to perpetuate or renew the error, by applying to the Turkey the name of <HI>Meleagris.</HI></P>
<P>Ray, who maintains that Turkies have derived their origin from Africa or the Ea&s;t Indies, &s;eems to have &s;uffered him&s;elf to be deceived by names. That of the bird of <HI>Numidia,</HI> which he adopts, implies an African de&s;cent; that of <HI>Turkey</HI> and the <HI>Bird of Calecut,</HI> denotes an A&s;iatic extraction. But no proof can be drawn from the name be&s;towed by ill-informed people, or even the &s;cientific term impo&s;ed by philo&s;ophers, who are not al|ways exempted from prejudices. Be&s;ides, Ray him&s;elf admits with Dr. Sloane, that the&s;e birds delight in the warm countries of America, and there multiply prodigiou&s;ly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Synop&s;is Avium, Append. p. 182.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to Ge&s;ner, he admits indeed that mo&s;t of the ancients, and among others Ari&s;totle
<PB N="134" REF="143">
and Pliny, were totally unacquainted with Tur|kies; but he &s;uppo&s;es that in the following quo|tation Aelian had them in view: <Q REND="inline">India,</Q> &s;ays this ancient, <Q REND="inline">produces a &s;ort of very large cocks, who&s;e comb is not red like that of ours, but &s;o rich and variegated as to re&s;emble a crown of flowers; the feathers of the tail are not arched nor bent into circles, but flat, and when they are not erected, they trail like tho&s;e of the peacock; their plumage is of an emerald colour.</Q></P>
<P>But it does not appear that this pa&s;&s;age relates to Turkey Cocks; for, 1. The &s;ize does not prove the point, it being well known that in A&s;ia, and e&s;pecially in Per&s;ia and at Pegu, the common cocks are exceedingly large.</P>
<P N="2">2. This comb, compo&s;ed of various colours, is alone &s;ufficient to overturn the opinion, &s;ince Turkies have never any comb; and what is here de&s;cribed is not a tuft of feathers, but a real comb, &s;imilar to that of the ordinary cock, though of a different colour.</P>
<P N="3">3. The manner it holds its tail, re&s;embling the peacock, is equally inconclu&s;ive; for Aelian po|&s;itively &s;ays, that the bird which he is de&s;cribing carries its tail like the peacock, <HI>when it does not erect it</HI>; and if there had been an erection, ac|companied with a wheeling motion, Aelian would not have omitted a character &s;o &s;ingular, and which forms &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance to the pea|cock,
<PB N="135" REF="144">
with which he was at the &s;ame in&s;tant drawing a compari&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly, The emerald colour of the plumage is not &s;ufficient to decide whether the de&s;cription refers to the Turkey, though &s;ome of its feathers have that tinge, and in certain &s;ituations reflect that &s;ort of light, &s;ince many other birds have the &s;ame properties.</P>
<P>Nor does Belon &s;eem to re&s;t his opinion on better foundation, when he attempts to di&s;cover Turkies in the writings of the ancients. Colu|mella had &s;aid in his treati&s;e <HI>De re ru&s;tica: Afri|cana e&s;t meleagridi &s;imilis, ni&s;i quod rutilam ga|leam et cri&s;tam capite gerit, quae utraque in me|leagrida &s;unt coerulea</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. viii. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">The African hen is like the meleagris, only its tuft and comb are red, but in the other both are coerulean.</Q> Belon takes this <HI>African hen</HI> for the pintado, and the meleagris for the Turkey; but it is evident from the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf, that Columella &s;peaks here only of two varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies; &s;ince the two birds mentioned are perfectly alike, except in colour, which is liable to vary in the &s;ame &s;pecies, e&s;pecially in that of the pintado, of which in the males the membranous appendices that hang on both &s;ides of the cheeks are of a blue colour, while in the female the &s;ame parts are red. Be&s;ides, is it likely that Columella, wi&s;hing to di&s;tingui&s;h two &s;pecies &s;o remote from each other as the pintado and the Turkey,
<PB N="136" REF="145">
would be contented in &s;electing a &s;light differ|ence of colour, in&s;tead of marking obvious and &s;triking characters?</P>
<P>But if the attempts of Belon to be&s;tow on Turkies, from the authority of Columella, an African origin, are without foundation, his &s;ucce&s;s is not greater, when he &s;eeks, from the following pa&s;&s;age of Ptolemy, to give them an A&s;iatic origin:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Trigliphon Regia, where the common cocks are &s;aid to be bearded.</Q> This Trigliphon is &s;ituated indeed beyond the Ganges; but there is no rea&s;on to be|lieve that the&s;e bearded cocks are Turkies; for, 1. The very exi&s;tence of the&s;e cocks is uncertain, re&s;ting merely on hear&s;ay. 2. This de&s;cription cannot refer to Turkies, &s;ince, as I have before ob&s;erved, the word <HI>beard,</HI> applied to a bird, can mean only a tuft of feathers, or hairs, placed under the bill, not the lock of &s;tiff hair which the Turkies have on the under part of the neck. 3. Ptolemy was an a&s;tronomer and geographer, and not a naturali&s;t; and it is evident that he wi&s;hed to render his charts more intere&s;ting, by introducing, and not always with judgment, accounts of the peculiarities of each country. In the very &s;ame page he &s;peaks of three i&s;lands of &s;atyrs, who&s;e inhabitants had tails; and he tells us, that the Manioles are ten i&s;lands &s;ituated nearly in the &s;ame climate, where load&s;tone abounds &s;o much, that iron cannot be employed in the con&s;truction of &s;hips,
<PB N="137" REF="146">
becau&s;e of the danger of their being attracted and held by the magnetic force. But the&s;e human tails, though a&s;&s;erted by &s;everal tra|vellers, and by the Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries, ac|cording to Gemelli Careri, are at lea&s;t very doubtful; and the mountains of load&s;tone, or rather their effects on the iron of ve&s;&s;els, are no le&s;s &s;o: &s;o that little confidence can be put in facts mingled with &s;uch uncertain rela|tions. 4. La&s;tly, Ptolemy, in the place above quoted, &s;peaks expre&s;sly of ordinary cocks, which cannot be confounded with Turkey|cocks, neither in their external form, their plumage, their cry, their natural habits, the colour of their eggs, nor the time of incuba|tion, &amp;c. It is true that Scaliger, while he admits that the meleagris of Athenaeus, or ra|ther of Clytus, who is quoted by Athenaeus, was an Aetolian bird that loved wet &s;ituations, which was aver&s;e to hatching, and who&s;e fle&s;h had a mar&s;hy ta&s;te, none of which characters belong to the Turkey; which is not an inha|bitant of Aetolia, which avoids watery &s;pots, which has the greate&s;t affection to its young, and who&s;e fle&s;h has a delicate flavour; yet &s;till maintains that the meleagris is the Turkey. But the anatomi&s;ts of the Academy of Sciences, who were at fir&s;t of the &s;ame opinion, have, after examining the &s;ubject with more attention, a&s;certained and proved that the pintado was the real <HI>meleagris</HI> of the ancients. In &s;hort, we
<PB N="138" REF="147">
mu&s;t con&s;ider it as an e&s;tabli&s;hed point, that Athenaeus, or Clytus, Aelian, Columella, and Ptolemy, have no more &s;poken of Turkies than Ari&s;totle or Pliny; and that the&s;e birds were totally unknown to the ancients.</P>
<P>Nor can we find the lea&s;t mention of the Turkey in any modern work, written prior to the di&s;covery of America. A popular tradition refers the period of its fir&s;t introduction into France to the &s;ixteenth century, in the reign of Francis I.; for this was the time when Ad|miral Chabot lived. The authors of the Briti&s;h Zoology &s;tate it as a well-known fact, that they were introduced into England in the time of Henry VIII. the contemporary of Francis I.; which agrees exactly with our opinion. For America having been di&s;covered by Chri&s;to|pher Columbus towards the end of the fifteenth century, and the&s;e &s;overeigns having a&s;cended the throne about the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Turkies brought from the New World would under their reigns be regarded as novelties in France and England. This is confirmed too by the expre&s;s te&s;timony of J. Sperling, who wrote before 1660; he affirms, that they had been in|troduced from the New Indies into Europe more than a century prior to his time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Zoologia Phy&s;ica, p. 366.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Every thing, therefore, concurs to prove that the Turkies are natives of America. As they are

heavy birds, and cannot ri&s;e on the wing, or &s;wim, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to cro&s;s the ocean which &s;eparates the two continents. They are in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the qua|drupeds, which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man, would not have been di&s;per&s;ed through the Old and New Worlds. This reflection gives addi|tional weight to the te&s;timony of travellers, who a&s;&s;ure us, that they have never &s;een Wild Turkies either in Africa or A&s;ia, and that none are found there but &s;uch as are dome&s;tic, and brought from other parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Honourable Daines Barrington has publi&s;hed an E&s;&s;ay, in which he attempts to prove, that the Turkey was known before the di&s;covery of America. He examines the Comte de Buffon's arguments, and endeavours to invalidate or refute them; but his objections are entirely inconclu&s;ive. If the Turkey had been in|troduced into Spain by Columbus, it would have been called, &s;ays Mr. Barrington, <HI>the Mexican bird,</HI> and not <HI>pago,</HI> or <HI>pavo.</HI> Car|dinal Perron, who died in 1620, relates, that the Indian Cocks had prodigiou&s;ly multiplied, and were driven like flocks of &s;heep from Languedoc into Spain: therefore, &s;ays Mr. B. the Turkey mu&s;t have been introduced fir&s;t into France. The&s;e conjectures are &s;o vague as to merit no particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and when Mr. B. a&s;&s;erts, that Sperling means one hundred and one years, by the expre&s;&s;ion <Q REND="inline">Ante centum, &amp; <HI>quod excurrit</HI> annos,</Q> he &s;eems not to have attended to grammar. That phra&s;e is cla&s;&s;ical, and means indefinitely &s;ome time more than a century: nor will the word <HI>excurrit</HI> admit of any other interpretation.</P> 
<P>Mr. Barrington proceeds: <Q REND="inline">The Spani&s;h term is not <HI>pavon de las Indias,</HI> as M.

<P>I mu&s;t add, that the opinion of the Comte de Buffon concern|ing the native climate of the Turkey, is admitted by the inge|nious and re&s;pectable naturali&s;t Mr. Pennant, who has adduced &s;everal new arguments in &s;upport of it. Linnaeus, Gmelin, and Latham, entertain the &s;ame idea.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="149">
This determination of the natal region of the Turkey leads to the deci&s;ion of another que&s;tion, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eems to have no connec|tion with it. J. Sperling affirms, in his <HI>Zoo|logica Phy&s;ica,</HI> p. 369, that the Turkey is a mon&s;ter (he means an hybrid) produced by the union of the two &s;pecies, that of the peacock and of the ordinary cock; but as it is a&s;cer|tained that the Turkey is of American ex|traction, it could not be bred by the inter|cour&s;e of two A&s;iatic &s;pecies; and what com|pletely decides the point is, that no Wild Turkies are found through the whole extent of A&s;ia, though they abound in the fore&s;ts of America. But it will be &s;aid, what means the term <HI>gallo|pavus,</HI> which has &s;o long been applied to the Turkey? Nothing is &s;impler: the Turkey was a foreign bird which had no name in any of the European languages; and as it bore &s;everal &s;triking re&s;emblances to the common cock and the peacock, a compound word was formed expre&s;&s;ive of the&s;e analogies. Sperling and others would have us believe that it is really the cro&s;s-breed of the&s;e two &s;pecies; yet the inter|mixture
<PB N="141" REF="150">
con&s;i&s;ts entirely in the names.&mdash;So dangerous it is to be&s;tow upon animals com|pounded epithets, which are always ambi|guous.</P>
<P>Edwards mentions another hybrid produced between the Turkey and the phea&s;ant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gleanings.</BIBL></NOTE>. The individual which he de&s;cribes was &s;hot in the woods near Hanford in Dor&s;et&s;hire, where it was &s;een in the month of October 1759, with two or three other birds of the &s;ame kind. It was of a middle-&s;ize between the phea&s;ant and the Turkey, its wings extending thirty-two inches; a &s;mall tuft of pretty long black feathers ro&s;e on the ba&s;e of the upper mandible; the head was not bare like that of the Turkey, but covered with little &s;hort fea|thers; the eyes were &s;urrounded with a circle of red &s;kin, but not &s;o broad as in the phea&s;ant. It is not &s;aid whether this bird could &s;pread the large feathers of the tail into the wheel-&s;hape; it only appears from the figure, that it carried the tail in the &s;ame way as the Turkey generally does. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that this tail is compo&s;ed of &s;ixteen quills, as in the grous; while that of the Turkey and of the phea&s;ant con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen; al&s;o each feather on the body &s;hot double from the &s;ame root, the one branch &s;tiff and broad, the other &s;mall and co|vered with down, a character which belongs
<PB N="142" REF="151">
neither to the phea&s;ant nor the Turkey. If this bird was really a hybrid, it ought to have had, like other hybrids, 1&s;t, The characters common to the two primitive &s;pecies; 2dly, The qualities intermediate between the extremes; a circum|&s;tance that in this ca&s;e does not take place, &s;ince this individual had a character not to be found in either (the double feathers), and wanted others that occur in both (the eighteen quills of the tail). Indeed, if it be in&s;i&s;ted that it was hybridous, we &s;hould more rea&s;onably infer, that it was produced by the union of the Turkey with the grous; which, as I have remarked, has no more than &s;ixteen feathers in the tail, but has the double feathers.</P>
<P>The Wild Turkies differ not from the do|me&s;tic &s;ort, except that they are much larger and blacker; they have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions, the &s;ame natural habits, and the &s;ame &s;tupidity. They perch in the woods on the dry branches, and when one falls by a &s;hot, the re&s;t are not intimidated by the report, but all continue &s;ecure in the &s;ame po&s;ition. According to Fernandes, their fle&s;h, though plea&s;ant to eat, is harder and not &s;o delicate as that of the Tame Turkies; but they are twice as large. The Mexican name of the male is <HI>hucxolotl,</HI> and that of the female <HI>cihuatotolin.</HI> Albin tells us, that many Engli&s;h gentlemen amu&s;e them&s;elves in breeding Wild Turkies, and that the&s;e birds thrive very well in &s;mall woods, parks, or other inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="152">
The Cre&s;ted Turkey is only a variety of the common kind, &s;imilar to what occurs among the ordinary cocks. It is &s;ometimes black, &s;ometimes white. That de&s;cribed by Albin was of the u&s;ual &s;ize; its feet fle&s;h-coloured, the upper part of the body deep brown; the brea&s;t, belly, thighs, and tail, white; and al&s;o the feathers that form the tuft. In other re&s;pects it re&s;embled exactly the ordinary kind; it had the &s;pongy and glandulous fle&s;h which covers the head and arch of the neck, and the lock of hard hair ri&s;ing (apparently) from the brea&s;t, and the &s;hort &s;purs on each foot; it al&s;o bore the &s;ame &s;ingular antipathy to &s;carlet, &amp;c. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Turkey, <HI>Meleagris Gallopavo:</HI> <Q REND="inline">The caruncle of the head is extended to the forehead and the throat; the brea&s;t of the male is bearded.</Q> The Wild Tur|kies are of a dingy uniform colour; and &s;eldom weigh more than thirty pounds.

<P>Dampier informs us, that in the i&s;land of May, one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, there are Pintados, of which the fle&s;h is of an uncom|mon whitene&s;s; and others, of which it is black; but that in all of them it is tender and delicate. Father Labat gives the &s;ame account. This difference, if the fact be true, would ap|pear to be the more con&s;iderable, as it cannot be imputed to the change of climate; &s;ince the Pintados on this i&s;land, which is near the Afri|can &s;hore, may be con&s;idered as in their native re&s;idence; at lea&s;t unle&s;s we a&s;&s;ert that the &s;ame cau&s;es which tinge with black the &s;kin and <HI>perio&s;teum</HI> of mo&s;t of the birds in the i&s;lands of St. Jago, darken al&s;o the fle&s;h of the Pintados in the neighbouring i&s;land of May.</P>

<P>La&s;tly, the academicians found in &s;ome indi|viduals the&s;e filaments on the <HI>occiput</HI> ri&s;ing an inch, &s;o that they formed a kind of tuft behind the head.</P>
<P>It would be difficult, from all the&s;e varieties, to &s;elect tho&s;e that are &s;o deeply and &s;o per|manently &s;tamped, as to con&s;titute di&s;tinct races; and as we cannot doubt but that they are very recent, it will perhaps be &s;afe&s;t to regard them as the effects produced by dome&s;tication, change of climate, nature of the food, &amp;c.; and with|out introducing them into the de&s;cription, to mark the limits of the variations to which cer|tain qualities of the Pintado are &s;ubject, and to
<PB N="152" REF="162">
endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to a&s;cend to tho&s;e cau&s;es, of which the continued operation has at la&s;t imprinted con&s;tant characters, and formed di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In one circum&s;tance, the Pintado bears a &s;triking re&s;emblance to the turkey; viz. it has no feathers on the head, nor on the arch of the neck. This has induced &s;everal ornithologi&s;ts, as Belon, Ge&s;ner, Aldrovandus, and Klein, to take the turkey for the Meleagris of the ancients. But not to mention the numberle&s;s points of dif|ference between the&s;e two &s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Meleagris was, according to the ancients, as large as a good hen, and it had a fle&s;hy tubercle on the head; its plumage was marked with white &s;pots like lentils, but larger; there were two barbils attached to the upper mandible, the tail was pendulous, the back round, there were membranes between the toes, and no &s;purs at the feet: it delighted in mar&s;hes, had no tenderne&s;s for its young. The&s;e characters are entirely different from tho&s;e of the turkey, which, on the other hand, has many properties not to be found in the de&s;cription of the Meleagris; particularly the bunch of hairs that hangs under the neck, and his manner of di&s;|playing his tail, and of pacing around his female.</NOTE>, we need only refer to the proofs by which it was decided that the turkey was peculiar to America, and could never migrate into the ancient con|tinent.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on &s;eems al&s;o to have mi&s;taken, when, from a quotation of Kolben<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">A bird which belongs properly to the Cape,</Q> &s;ays this traveller, <Q REND="inline">is the <HI>Knor-hahn,</HI> or <HI>Coq-knor.</HI> It is the centinel of the other birds; it informs them, when it &s;ees a man approach, by a &s;cream re&s;embling the &s;ound of the word <HI>crac,</HI> and which it repeats very loud. It is as large as a common hen; its bill is &s;hort and black, like the feathers on its crown; the plumage of the wings and body is mixed with red, white, and cine|reous; the legs are yellow, and the wings &s;mall. It frequents &s;olitary places, and builds its ne&s;t in the bu&s;hes; it lays two eggs; its fle&s;h is not much e&s;teemed, though it is very good.</Q></NOTE>, he in&s;erted <HI>Knor|haan</HI> <PB N="153" REF="163"> in the
li&s;t of the names of the Pintado. I agree with Bri&s;&s;on, that the figure
given by this traveller is only copied from that of the African Hen of
Marcgrave; he mu&s;t al&s;o allow that it would be hard to admit a bird
peculiar to the Cape of Good Hope to be the Pintado, which is &s;pread through
the whole of Africa, and le&s;s common at that promontory than in other parts
of the country; &s;till more difficult will it be to reconcile the &s;hort
black bill, the crown of feathers, the red which is intermixed with the colours
of the wings and of the body, and the quality which Kolben a&s;cribes to his
<HI>Knor-haan,</HI> that it lays only two eggs.</P>
<P>The plumage of the Pintado, though not decorated with rich and dazzling colours, is re|markably beautiful. It is of a blui&s;h-grey ground, &s;prinkled with con&s;iderable regularity, with white roundi&s;h &s;peckles, re&s;embling pearls. Hence &s;ome of the moderns have be&s;towed on this bird the name of <HI>Pearled Hen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>; and the ancients applied the epithets <HI>varia</HI> and <HI>guttata</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Martial's Epigrams.</BIBL></NOTE>. Such, at lea&s;t, was the plumage in its native climate; but &s;ince it has been carried into other
<PB N="154" REF="164">
countries, it has a&s;&s;umed more of the white. Thus the Pintados at Jamaica and St. Do|mingo are white on the brea&s;t; and Edwards mentions &s;ome entirely white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gleanings, <HI>Part Third.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The white|ne&s;s of the brea&s;t, therefore, which Bri&s;&s;on con&s;iders as the character of a variety, is only an alteration begun in the natural colour, or rather it is the &s;hade between that colour and complete whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>The feathers on the middle part of the neck are very &s;hort near its arch, where they are entirely wanting. From that part they gra|dually lengthen unto the brea&s;t, and there they are three inches long<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour &s;ervir l'Hi&s;toire des Animaux, <HI>Partie</HI> II. p. 81.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e feathers are of a downy texture from their root to near their middle, and this part is covered by the tips of the feathers in the pre|ceding row, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;tiff webs interwoven with each other.</P>
<P>It has &s;hort wings and a pendulous tail, like that of the partridge, which, joined to the arrangement of its feathers, makes it look as if it were hunch-backed <HI>(Genus Gibberum,</HI> PLIN.); but this appearance is fal&s;e, and no ve&s;tige re|mains when the bird is plucked<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lettres Edifiantes, <HI>Receuil</HI> xx.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ize is nearly that of an ordinary hen, but the &s;hape is like that of the partridge; hence
<PB N="155" REF="165">
it has been called the Newfoundland Partridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. But it is of a taller form, and its neck longer, and more &s;lender near the arch.</P>
<P>The barbils which ri&s;e from the upper man|dible have no invariable form, being oval in &s;ome, and &s;quare or triangular in others; they are red in the female, and blui&s;h in the male; and, according to the academicians and Bri&s;&s;on, it is this circum&s;tance alone which di&s;tingui&s;hes the two &s;exes. But other authors, as we have already &s;een, have a&s;&s;igned different marks drawn from the colours of the plumage<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Caius <HI>apud Ge&s;nerum.</HI></NOTE>, of the barbils<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Columella, Fri&s;ch, Dampier, &amp;c.</NOTE>, the callous tubercle on the head<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus, Roberts, Barrere, Dalechamp, &amp;c.</NOTE>, the caruncles of the no&s;trils<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Barrere, Labat, Dampier, &amp;c.</NOTE>, the &s;ize of the body<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>, the &s;ilky threads of the <HI>occiput,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch, Barrere, &amp;c.</NOTE>; whether the&s;e differences really re&s;ult from the &s;ex, or by a logical error, which is but too com|mon, the accidental properties of the individual have been regarded as &s;exual.</P>
<P>Behind the barbils, we perceive on the &s;ides of the head the very &s;mall orifice of the ears, which in mo&s;t birds is concealed by feathers, but in this is expo&s;ed. But what is peculiar to the Pintado is, a callous bump, or a kind of ca&s;que, which ri&s;es on its head, and which Belon improperly compares to the tubercle, or
<PB N="156" REF="166">
rather to the horn of the <HI>giraffe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was on account of this tubercle that Linnaeus termed the Pintado, in the &s;ixth edition, <HI>Hen with a</HI> HORNY <HI>top</HI>; and in his tenth edition, <HI>Phea&s;ant with a</HI> CALLOUS <HI>top.</HI></NOTE>. It re&s;embles in &s;hape the rever&s;e of the ducal cap of the Doge of Venice, or this cap placed with its back towards the front. Its colour varies in different &s;ubjects, from white to reddi&s;h, pa&s;&s;|ing through the intermediate &s;hades of yellow and brown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is whiti&s;h in Fri&s;ch; wax-coloured, according to Belon; brown, according to Marcgrave; tawny brown, according to Perrault; and reddi&s;h in the <BIBL><HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Its interior &s;urface is like that of hard callous fle&s;h, and it is covered with a dry wrinkled &s;kin, which extends over the <HI>occiput,</HI> and on the &s;ides of the head, but is fur|rowed where the eyes are placed. Tho&s;e natu|rali&s;ts who deal in final cau&s;es, have a&s;&s;erted, that this is a real helmet, be&s;towed on the Pin|tados as a defen&s;ive armour, to protect them again&s;t the attacks which they make on each other, becau&s;e they are quarrel&s;ome birds, and have a &s;trong bill and a delicate &s;kull.</P>
<P>The eyes are large and covered; the upper eye-lid has long black hairs bent upwards, and the cry&s;talline lens is more convex at the ante|rior than at the po&s;terior &s;urface.</P>
<P>Perrault affirms, that the bill is like that of the common hen; the Jefuit Margat makes it thrice as large, very hard, and pointed; the claws are al&s;o &s;harper, according to Labat. But
<PB N="157" REF="167">
all agree, both ancients and moderns, in &s;aying that the feet have no &s;purs.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable difference which oc|curs between the ordinary hen and the Pintado; that the inte&s;tines of the latter are much &s;horter in proportion, not exceeding three feet, ac|cording to the academicians, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>caeca,</HI> which are each &s;ix inches, and widen as they extend from their origin, and receive, like the other inte&s;tines, ve&s;&s;els from the me&s;entery. The large&s;t of all is the <HI>duodenum,</HI> which is eight lines in diameter. The gizzard is like that of the common hen; and al&s;o contains numbers of &s;mall pebbles, and &s;ometimes even nothing el&s;e; probably when the animal, dying of a lan|gui&s;hing di&s;temper, has pa&s;&s;ed the clo&s;e of its life without eating at all.</P>
<P>The inner membrane of the gizzard is full of wrinkles; it adheres loo&s;ely to the nervous coat, and is of a &s;ub&s;tance analogous to horn.</P>
<P>The craw, when inflated, is about the &s;ize of a tennis ball; the duct, which joins it to the gizzard, is of a harder and whiter &s;ub&s;tance than what precedes the craw, and does not pre|&s;ent near &s;o many di&s;tinct ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The <HI>ae&s;ophagus</HI> de&s;cends along the neck, to the right of the <HI>trachea-arteria</HI>; becau&s;e, no doubt, the neck, which, as I have already &s;aid, is very long, bending oftener forwards than &s;ide|wi&s;e, the <HI>ae&s;ophagus</HI> pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>trachea|arteria,</HI> who&s;e rings are entirely o&s;&s;eous, has

<P>The&s;e birds are &s;ubject to &s;chirrous concre|tions in the liver, and even in the kidney. Some have been found without any gall-bladder; but in this ca&s;e the hepatic branch was very thick. Others have occurred with only one te&s;ticle; in general, it &s;eems that the internal parts are no le&s;s liable to changes than the exterior and &s;u|perficial parts.</P>
<P>The heart is more pointed than common in birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour &s;ervir a l'Hi&s;t. Nat. des Animaux.</BIBL></NOTE>; the lungs are of the ordinary &s;hape.

<P>I &s;hall add another anatomical remark, which has perhaps &s;ome connection with the habit of crying and the clamorous notes of the Pintado; it is, that the <HI>trachea-arteria</HI> receives in the cavity of the thorax two &s;mall mu&s;cular chords of an inch long, and two-thirds of a line broad, which are in&s;erted on each &s;ide<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour &s;ervir a l'Hi&s;t.

<P>The Pintado is an exceedingly noi&s;y bird, and for this rea&s;on Brown has termed it <HI>Gallus clamo&s;us</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Natural Hi&s;tory of Jamaica.</BIBL></NOTE>. Its cry is &s;harp, and by its con|tinuance,

<P>The Greeks had a word appropriated to de|note the &s;creaming of the Pintado<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, according to Pollux. <HI>Ge&s;ner.</HI>&mdash;That word &s;ignifies al&s;o <HI>to laugh loud.</HI></NOTE>.

Belon tells us, that it is analo|gous to the chirping of young chickens lately hatched; but at the &s;ame time he po&s;itively affirms, that it is unlike that of ordinary hens. I cannot conceive why Aldrovandus and Salerne a&s;&s;ert the contrary.</P>
<P>The Pintado is a lively, re&s;tle&s;s, and turbulent bird, that di&s;likes to remain in the &s;ame place, and contrives to become ma&s;ter of the poultry|yard. It can intimidate even the turkies; for, though much &s;maller, it gains the a&s;cendency over them by the mere dint of petulance. <Q REND="inline">The Pintado,</Q> &s;ays Father Margat, <Q REND="inline">wheels &s;ometimes round, gives twenty &s;trokes with his bill, before the&s;e heavy birds are rou&s;ed to defence.</Q> The Hens of Numidia &s;eem to have the &s;ame mode of fighting which the hi&s;torian Sallu&s;t imputes to the cavalry of that country. <Q REND="inline">Their charge is &s;udden and irre|gular;

<P>Aelian relates, that in a certain i&s;land the Meleagris is re&s;pected by the birds of prey<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;toria Animalium,</HI> lib. v. 27.</BIBL></NOTE>; but I pre&s;ume that in every country of the world, the&s;e would rather attack other fowls, who&s;e bill is not &s;o &s;trong, who&s;e head is not protected by a ca&s;que, and who are not &s;o well acquainted with the art of defence.</P>
<P>The Pintado is one of tho&s;e birds which &s;eek, by weltering in the du&s;t, to rid them&s;elves of in&s;ects. They al&s;o &s;crape the ground like com|mon hens, and roam in numerous flocks.

They are at great pains, Belon adds, in providing their food; and, indeed, con&s;ider|ing the length of their inte&s;tines, they mu&s;t con&s;ume more than ordinary fowls, and be &s;ub|ject to more frequent calls of hunger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Seve ob&s;erved, in throwing &s;ome bread to Pintados, that when one of them happened to take a bit larger than it could im|mediately &s;wallow, it hurried away with it out of the reach of the other fowls, and hid it in the dunghill, or in the earth, and &s;ome|time afterwards returned and ate it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears from the concurrence of the an|cients<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pliny, <HI>Hi&s;toria Naturalis,</HI> lib. xxxvii. 2.</BIBL> and Clitus of Mile|tus, in Athenaeus.</NOTE> and moderns<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, Fri&s;ch,&mdash;<BIBL>Lettres Edifiantes.</BIBL></NOTE>, which is al&s;o corrobo|rated by the &s;emi-membranes which connect the toes, that the Pintado is partly an aquatic bird.

<P>If they be trained when young, they &s;oon become tame. Brue relates, that when he was at the coa&s;t of Senegal, he received, as a pre|&s;ent from a prince&s;s of that country, two Pin|tados, a male and a female, both of which were &s;o familiar that they would come to eat on his

Moore &s;ays, that they are as wild as the phea|&s;ants are in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages,</HI> tome iii. p. 310.</BIBL></NOTE>; but I &s;u&s;pect he never &s;aw phea&s;ants &s;o tame as Brue's Pintados. And what proves that the Pintados are not very wild is, that they receive the food which is offered them the moment after they are caught.</P>
<P>The Pintado lays and hatches nearly like the ordinary hen; but its fecundity appears to be not the &s;ame in different climates, or at lea&s;t that this is much greater in the dome&s;tic condi|tion, where food is more abundant, than in the &s;avage &s;tate, which affords but a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. I have been informed that it is wild in the I&s;le of France, and there lays ten or twelve eggs on the ground in the woods; whereas tho&s;e that are dome&s;tic in St. Domingo, and &s;eek the hedges and bu&s;hes to depo&s;ite their eggs, lay 100, or 150, provided that one be left con&s;tantly in the ne&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e eggs are &s;maller in proportion than tho&s;e of an ordinary hen, and their &s;hell is much harder. But there is a remarkable dif|ference between tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic Pintados and tho&s;e of the wild &s;ort; the latter are marked with &s;mall round &s;pots like tho&s;e on their plum|age;
<PB N="163" REF="173">
and this circum&s;tance has not been over|looked by Ari&s;totle; but tho&s;e of the former are at fir&s;t of a pretty bright red, which after|wards fades, and at la&s;t runs into the faint colour of a dried ro&s;e. If this fact be true, as I have been a&s;&s;ured by Fournier, who has rai&s;ed many of the&s;e birds, we mu&s;t conclude that the influence of dome&s;tication penetrates here &s;o deeply, as to change not only the colours of the plumage, as we have already &s;een, but even tho&s;e of the matter which forms the &s;hell of the eggs; and as this does not happen in other &s;pecies, there is rea&s;on to conclude that the na|ture of the Pintado is not &s;o fixed and invariable as that of other birds.</P>
<P>Is the Pintado watchful or not of its brood? This is a problem that has not yet been &s;olved. Belon replies without qualification in the affirma|tive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">They are very prolific, and careful in rearing their young.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Hi&s;tory of Birds.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Fri&s;ch is of the &s;ame opinion with re|gard to his great
&s;pecies, which delights in dry &s;ituations, but affirms that the contrary is
true of the &s;mall &s;pecies, which prefers mar&s;hes. But mo&s;t authors
impute to them a degree of indifference for their offspring; the Je&s;uit
Mar|gat informs us, that at St. Domingo they are not &s;uffered to cover their
eggs, becau&s;e they di&s;cover &s;o little attachment, and &s;o often aban|don
their young<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lettres Edifiantes.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
planters give their <PB N="164" REF="174"> eggs to be hatched, he &s;ays, under
turkies or common hens.</P>
<P>I can find nothing with re&s;pect to the time of incubation; but if we judge from the &s;ize of the bird, and from our knowledge of other &s;pecies to which it is mo&s;t analogous, we may allow three weeks, more or le&s;s, according to the heat of the &s;ea&s;on or climate, and the a&s;&s;i|duity of the &s;itter, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In their fir&s;t infancy, the young Pintados have neither the barbles nor the ca&s;que; they re|&s;emble the red partridges in their plumage, and the colour of their feet and bill, and it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the young males from the old fe|males<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have this fact from Fournier, who was mentioned above.</NOTE>; for in all the&s;e &s;pecies, the maturity of the females corre&s;ponds to the infancy of the males.</P>
<P>The young Pintados are very tender, and being natives of the burning climates of Africa, are with difficulty reared in our northern coun|tries. According to Father Margat, they feed at St. Domingo, as well as the old ones, on millet. At the I&s;le of May, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the gra&s;shoppers and worms, which they find them|&s;elves by &s;craping the ground with their nails<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dampier and Labat.</NOTE>; and Fri&s;ch &s;ays, that they live on all &s;orts of grain and in&s;ects.</P>
<P>The Pintado cock breeds al&s;o with the com|mon hen. But it is a kind of artificial union,
<PB N="165" REF="175">
which requires attention to bring about. They mu&s;t be bred together from their infancy; and the hybridous intercour&s;e gives birth to a ba&s;|tard progeny of an imperfect &s;tructure, and di&s;avowed, as it were, by nature. Their eggs are de&s;titute of the prolific power, and the race is extingui&s;hed in the death of the indi|viduals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fournier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Pintados that are rai&s;ed in our poultry|yards have an excellent flavour, in no re&s;pect inferior to that of partridges; but the wild or che&s;nut &s;ort of St. Domingo have the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite reli&s;h, and exceed the delicacy of the phea&s;ant. The eggs of the Pintado too are a very agreeable food.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that the Pintado is of African origin; and hence all the names that have been be&s;towed on it: hen of Africa, of Numidia, the foreign hen, that of Barbary, of Tunis, of Mauritania, of Lybia, of Guinea, of Egypt, of Pharaoh, and even of Jeru&s;alem.

they were dome&s;tic, and car|ried from Africa to A&s;ia, as they have been
tran&s;ported from Europe to America. But as the&s;e birds were accu&s;tomed to
a hot climate, they could not &s;upport the inten&s;e cold that reigns on the

<P>Varro &s;ays, that in his time the African hens, (it is thus he names the Pintados,) were &s;old for a high price at Rome, on account of their &s;carcity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Re Ru&s;tic&acirc;, lib. iii. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>. They were much more com|mon in Greece in the age of Pau&s;anias; &s;ince this author po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that the melea|gris, with the common goo&s;e, was what per|&s;ons who were not in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, ge|nerally pre&s;ented at an offering in the &s;olemn my&s;teries of I&s;is. But we mu&s;t not therefore infer, that the Pintados were natives of Greece; for, according to Athenaeus, the Aeolians were the fir&s;t Greeks who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e birds. Yet I conceive that &s;ome trace of a regular migration may be di&s;covered from the battles that were annually fought with the&s;e birds in Boeotia, on the tomb of Meleager; which are mentioned both by the naturali&s;ts and my|thologi&s;ts<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pliny, lib. x. 26.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>IF we were to judge of things by their names only, we &s;hould take this bird for a wild cock or a phea&s;ant; for in many countries, par|ticularly in Italy, it is called Wild Cock<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Albin de&s;cribes the male and female under the name of the <HI>Black Cock and Hen</HI> of the Mu&s;covy mountains.</NOTE>, <HI>gallo alpe&s;tre, &s;elvatico</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> Mountain Cock, Wood Cock.</NOTE>. In other places, it is termed the <HI>Noi&s;y Phea&s;ant,</HI> and the <HI>Wild Phea|&s;ant.</HI> But it differs from the phea&s;ant in its tail, which is of another &s;hape, and only half the length; in the number of great feathers that compo&s;e it; in the extent of its wings compared
<PB N="170" REF="181">
with its other dimen&s;ions; and in the form of its feet, which are rough and without &s;purs, &amp;c. Be&s;ides, though both the&s;e &s;pecies of birds de|light in fore&s;ts, they are &s;eldom found in the &s;ame &s;pots; the phea&s;ant, which &s;huns cold, fixes its re&s;idence in the woods that grow in the plains; while the Grous prefers the chill ex|po&s;ure of the woods which crown the &s;ummits of lofty mountains. Hence the names of <HI>Cock of the Mountain,</HI> and <HI>Cock of the Wood.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who, with Ge&s;ner, and &s;ome others, would con&s;ider it as the original cock, can in|deed found their conjecture on &s;ome analogies; the general &s;hape of its body; the particular configuration of its bill; the red projecting &s;kin above the eyes, the &s;ingular nature of its fea|thers, which are mo&s;tly double, and ri&s;e in pairs from the &s;ame root, a property which, ac|cording to Belon, is peculiar to the ordinary cock; and la&s;tly, they have the &s;ame common habits, one male &s;upplying &s;everal females, and the&s;e not building any ne&s;ts, but &s;itting on their eggs with much a&s;&s;iduity, and &s;howing a &s;trong affection to their young after they are hatched. But if we con&s;ider that the Grous has no mem|branes under its bill, and no &s;purs on its feet; that its feet are clothed with plumage, and its toes are edged with a kind of indenting; that there are two quills more in the tail; that this tail is not divided into two planes as in the ordinary cock, but can be di&s;played like a fan
<PB N="171" REF="182">
as in the turkey; that its bulk is quadruple that of the ordinary cock; that it is fond of cold countries, while the dome&s;tic fowls thrive be&s;t in temperate climates; that no in&s;tance was ever adduced of the intermixture of the breeds; and that their eggs are of a different colour: If to all the&s;e we add the proofs already given, that the ordinary cock is a native of the genial regions of A&s;ia, where travellers have hardly ever &s;een the Grous; we certainly cannot admit that the&s;e are the primitive &s;tock, and we mu&s;t impute it to an error occa&s;ioned, like many others, by the deceitful glo&s;s of names.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle merely mentions a bird which he terms <HI>tetrix,</HI> and which the Athenians called <HI>ourax,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">); it is a bird, he &s;ays, which does not ne&s;tle on trees or on the ground, but among low creeping plants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. <BIBL>Lib. vi. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>. A little afterwards, he adds, that the <HI>tetrix</HI> does not make any ne&s;t, but drops its eggs on the ground like all the heavy birds, and covers them with &s;tiff herbs. This &s;hort de&s;cription manife&s;tly applies to the Grous, the female of which con&s;tructs no ne&s;t, but drops her eggs on mo&s;s, and when obliged to leave them, covers them carefully with leaves. Be|&s;ides, the Latin word <HI>tetrao,</HI> which Pliny employs to &s;ignify the Grous, has an evident analogy to the Greek <HI>tetrix,</HI> not to mention the re&s;emblance which the Athenian <HI>ourax</HI> bears to the com|pound
<PB N="172" REF="183">
term <HI>ourh-hahn</HI> be&s;towed by the Ger|mans, a coincidence which cannot with pro|priety be a&s;cribed to chance.</P>
<P>But there is a circum&s;tance which &s;eems to &s;hed &s;ome doubts on the identity of the&s;e birds. Pliny, de&s;cribing his <HI>tetrao</HI> at &s;ome length, never takes notice of what Ari&s;totle had &s;aid of the <HI>tetrix,</HI> which it is likely he would have done, if he had conceived the&s;e to be the &s;ame; unle&s;s the &s;light mention made by Ari&s;totle had e&s;caped the Roman naturali&s;t.</P>
<P>With regard to the great <HI>tetrax</HI> of which Athe|naeus &s;peaks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>, it is certainly not our Grous, &s;ince it has fle&s;hy barbles like tho&s;e of the cock, ri&s;ing near the ears and de&s;cending below the bill; a character quite foreign to the Grous, and which applies much better to the Meleagris or Numidian hen, which is our Pintado.</P>
<P>The little <HI>tetrax</HI> mentioned by the &s;ame author, is, according to him, an exceeding &s;mall bird; and this excludes all compari&s;on with our Wood Grous, which is one of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the <HI>tetrax</HI> of the poet Neme|&s;ianus, who dwells on its &s;tupidity, Ge&s;ner con&s;iders it as a &s;pecies of bu&s;tard. But I di&s;|cover a di&s;criminating mark of re&s;emblance to the meleagris in the colours of its plumage; the
<PB N="173" REF="184">
ground is of an a&s;h-gray, &s;prinkled with &s;pots in the &s;hape of drops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fragments of Books on Bird-catching</HI>; a&s;cribed by &s;ome to the Poet Neme&s;ianus, who lived in the third century of the Chri&s;tian aera.</NOTE>; a circum&s;tance which has given the pintado the name of <HI>Gallina Guttata</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Et picta perdix, Numidicaeque guttatae.</HI> <Q REND="inline">And the painted partridge, and the &s;peckled Numidian hens.</Q> <BIBL>MARTIAL.</BIBL> This is exactly the plumage of the two hens belonging to the Duke of Ferrara, of which Ge&s;ner &s;ays, in his account of the Pintado: <Q REND="inline">That they were entirely of a cinereous colour, with a whiti&s;h ca&s;t, and with black and round &s;pots.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But whatever be the force of the&s;e conjec|tures, it appears inconte&s;tably proved, that the two &s;pecies of the <HI>tetrao</HI> of Pliny are really tho&s;e of our Grous: the fine &s;hining black of their plumage; the flame-colour of their eye|brows; their re&s;idence in cold mountainous countries<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">A glo&s;&s;y jet black becomes the <HI>tetraones,</HI> and a &s;carlet on the eye-brows.&mdash;They inhabit the Alps, and the region of the North.</Q>&mdash;<BIBL>PLINY, lib. x. 22.</BIBL> The <HI>tetrao</HI> &s;een by Belon on the lofty mountains of Crete, corre&s;ponds well to Pliny's de|&s;cription.</NOTE>; the delicacy of their fle&s;h; the&s;e are properties that belong
both to the Wood and Black Grous. We can even di&s;tingui&s;h in Pliny's
de&s;cription, the traces of a peculiarity that has been remarked by few
moderns; <HI>Moriuntur contumaci&acirc;,</HI> &s;ays this author, <HI>&s;piritu
revocato</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> They die through
ob&s;tinacy, recalling their breath.</NOTE>. This refers to a curious
ob&s;ervation which Fri&s;ch has in&s;erted in his hi&s;tory of this bird. That
naturali&s;t, not being able to find <PB N="174" REF="185"> the tongue in a
dead Grous, opened the gizzard, and di&s;covered that it retreated there with
all its ligaments; and this mu&s;t commonly hap|pen, &s;ince it is the general
opinion of &s;port&s;men that the Grous has no tongue. The &s;ame, per|haps,
might be &s;aid of the Black Eagle men|tioned by Pliny, and the Brazil bird of
which Scaliger &s;peaks, which was reckoned to have not tongue. This opinion
might take its ri&s;e with credulous travellers, or unob&s;ervant hunters, who
never viewed this bird except when ex|piring, or after death, and no per&s;on
in&s;pecting their gizzard.</P>
<P>The other &s;pecies of <HI>tetrao,</HI> which Pliny de|&s;cribes at the &s;ame place, is much larger; &s;ince it exceeds the bu&s;tard, and even the vulture, which it re&s;embles in plumage, and in point of &s;ize is inferior to the o&s;trich alone: be&s;ides, it is &s;o unwieldy a bird, that it can be caught by the hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is literally true of the Little Grous, as we &s;hall find in the following article.</NOTE>. Belon a&s;&s;erts, that this &s;pecies of <HI>tetrao</HI> is unknown to the moderns, who, ac|cording to him, have never &s;een any Wood Grous larger, or even &s;o large as the bu&s;tard; and there is room to doubt, whether the bird mentioned in this pa&s;&s;age of Pliny by the names <HI>Otis</HI> and <HI>Avis tarda,</HI> was really our bu&s;tard, who&s;e fle&s;h has an excellent flavour, while the <HI>avis tarda</HI> of Pliny was very unpa|latable.
<PB N="175" REF="186">
But we mu&s;t not, on this account, infer with Belon, that the great <HI>tetrao</HI> was no other than the <HI>avis tarda</HI>; &s;ince the Roman na|turali&s;t names both the <HI>tetrao</HI> and the <HI>avis tarda</HI> in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, and compares them together as birds of different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>After a mature con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, I &s;hould rather conclude: 1. That the fir&s;t <HI>tetrao</HI> of which Pliny &s;peaks, is the &s;mall &s;pecies of Grous, to which what is here &s;aid more di|rectly refers; 2. That his great <HI>tetrao</HI> is our Wood Grous, which, without exaggeration, exceeds the bulk of the bu&s;tard. I my&s;elf weighed a large bu&s;tard, who&s;e extreme length was three feet three inches, and the extent of who&s;e wings was &s;ix feet and an half, and found it twelve pounds; but it is well known, and we &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to take notice of it, that &s;ome of the Wood Grous weigh more.</P>
<P>The Wood Grous has near four feet of alar extent. Its weight is generally twelve or fifteen pounds: Aldrovandus affirms, that he has &s;een &s;ome that were twenty-three pounds; but the&s;e were Bologna pounds, which contain each only ten ounces, and therefore twenty-three are not quite equal to fifteen pounds of &s;ixteen ounces. The Black Cock of the Moun|tains of Mu&s;covy, de&s;cribed by Albin, and which is really the Wood Grous, weighed ten pounds without the feathers or entrails; and the

&s;ame author informs us, that the <HI>lieures</HI> of Norway, which is really the &s;ame bird, is as large as a bu&s;tard.</P>

The feet are al&s;o firm, and clothed before with plumage; the craw is extremely wide, but, in other re&s;pects, both it and the gizzard are con&s;tructed as in the dome&s;tic cock: the coat of the gizzard has a velvet &s;oftne&s;s where the mu&s;cles are attached.</P>
<P>The Wood Grous feeds on the leaves or tops of the pine, of the juniper, of the cedar, of the willow, of the white poplar, of the hazel, of the myrtle, of the bramble; on thi&s;tles, fir-cones, the leaves and flowers of buck-wheat; on chichling vetch, millfoil, dandelion, trefoil, the vetch, and the choke-weed; e&s;pe|cially when the&s;e plants are young and tender. When the &s;eed begins to be formed, they leave the flowers, and only eat the leaves. They feed too, e&s;pecially in their fir&s;t year, on black-berries, beech-ma&s;t, and ants eggs.

<P>On opening the gizzard of the Wood Grous, &s;mall pebbles have been found, &s;imilar to tho&s;e in common poultry; a certain proof that they do not confine them&s;elves to the leaves and flow|ers which they pluck from the trees, but al&s;o feed on grains which they &s;eek by &s;craping the ground. When they eat too many juniper-berries, their fle&s;h, which otherwi&s;e is excellent, contracts an unplea&s;ant ta&s;te; and according to the remark of Pliny, it lo&s;es its delicate flavour, if kept in cages or coops, where it is &s;ometimes fed for curio&s;ity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. x. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The female differs from the male only in its &s;ize and plumage, being &s;maller and not &s;o black; be&s;ides, it excels the male in the beauty and variety of its colours; a circum&s;tance which is uncommon in birds, and even in other animals. From not at|tending to this fact, Ge&s;ner has made the female another &s;pecies of Grous, by the name of <HI>grygallus major,</HI> formed from the German term <HI>grugel-hahn</HI>; for the &s;ame rea&s;on, he has made the fe|male of the Black Grous another &s;pecies, which he calls <HI>grygallus minor.</HI> Yet he pretends that he did not fix the&s;e &s;pecies till he had carefully examined all the individuals, except the <HI>gry|gallus minor,</HI> and was confident that he could
<PB N="178" REF="189">
perceive characteri&s;tical differences. On the other hand, Schwenckfeld, who&s;e re&s;idence was among mountains, and who ob&s;erved the <HI>gry|gallus</HI> often and carefully, a&s;&s;ures us, that it was the female Grous; but it mu&s;t be admitted that in this &s;pecies, and perhaps in many others, the plumage is &s;ubject to great diver&s;ity, ari&s;ing from the age, the &s;ex, the climate, and other cir|cum&s;tances. The one which we have cau&s;ed to be engraved is &s;omewhat cre&s;ted. Bri&s;&s;on takes no notice of a cre&s;t in his de&s;cription; and of the two figures given by Aldrovandus, the one is cre&s;ted, the other not. Some pretend that the Grous, when young, has much white in its plumage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the bird di&s;plays its tail, the white forms a circle around it.</NOTE>, which dimini&s;hes, as the bird grows old, and &s;o regularly as to &s;erve as a mark for di&s;tingui&s;hing the age. It would even appear that the number of quills in the tail is not con|&s;tant; for Linnaeus makes it eighteen in his <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> and Bri&s;&s;on only &s;ixteen in his <HI>Ornithology</HI>; and what is more extraordinary, Schwenckfeld, who &s;aw and examined many of the&s;e birds, a&s;&s;erts that, both in the large and in the &s;mall &s;pecies, the females have eighteen tail-feathers, and the male only twelve. It therefore follows, that every &s;y&s;tem which a&s;|&s;umes, for its &s;pecific characters, differences &s;o variable as are the colours and even the number of the feathers, will be liable to the great incon|venience
<PB N="179" REF="190">
of multiplying the &s;pecies, (I &s;hould rather &s;ay, nominal &s;pecies, or more properly new terms,) of oppre&s;&s;ing the memory of begin|ners, and of giving them fal&s;e ideas of things, and con&s;equently that &s;uch a plan increa&s;es the difficulties in the &s;tudy of nature.</P>
<P>It is fal&s;e, what Encelius relates, that the male Grous &s;itting on a tree, calls the females to him with loud cries, emits <HI>&s;emen</HI> from his bill, which they &s;wallow, and again di&s;charge, and thus be|come impregnated. Nor is it true, that the part of the <HI>&s;emen</HI> which is not gathered up by the females, forms &s;erpents, precious &s;tones, and pearls. It is mortifying to our pride to &s;ee the human mind inflicted with grovelling errors, or hurried into &s;uch extravagant follies. The Grous couple like other birds; nor was Encelius un|acquainted with the fact; but he in&s;i&s;ts that the embrace is mere dalliance, and that the degluti|tion of the <HI>&s;emen</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to propagation!</P>
<P>The male Grous begins to be in &s;ea&s;on about the fir&s;t of February; the fiery appetite is mo&s;t inten&s;e towards the latter end of March, and continues till the leaves are expanded. During that period of love, each cock fixes his re&s;idence in a certain quarter, out of which he never re|moves. In the morning and evening he is ob|&s;erved walking backwards and forwards on the trunk of a large pine or other tree, his tail di&s;|played, his wings trailing, his neck projecting, his head ruffled, and a&s;&s;uming all &s;orts of un|common
<PB N="180" REF="191">
po&s;tures; with &s;uch force is he im|pelled by the burning de&s;ires! He has a certain note with which he calls his females, who run under the tree where he lodges, from which he &s;oon de&s;cends to ta&s;te the joys of love. This &s;ingular cry, which is very loud, and can be heard at a great di&s;tance, is perhaps the rea&s;on of the name which has been applied, of <HI>noi&s;y phea&s;ant.</HI> It begins with a kind of explo&s;ion, and expires in a &s;harp &s;hrill note, re&s;embling the &s;ound produced by whetting a &s;eythe.

<P>The Wood Grous, which at other times is very &s;hy, can ea&s;ily be &s;urpri&s;ed in the &s;ea&s;on of love, e&s;pecially when it is occupied with its call: it is then &s;tunned with its own noi&s;e, or, if we chu&s;e, &s;o intoxicated, that it is neither &s;cared by the &s;ight of man, nor rou&s;ed by the report of a fowling-piece. It &s;ees nothing, it hears no|thing, it is di&s;&s;olved into extacy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">It is &s;o overgrown that it may be caught motionle&s;s on the ground.</Q> <BIBL>PLINY.</BIBL> What that naturali&s;t imputes to its bulk, may be referred with greater probability to heat, and intoxication of its pa&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>; hence it has been &s;aid and even written, that the Grous is deaf
and blind. But almo&s;t all animals, not ex|cepting man, are, in &s;imilar
&s;ituations, ab&s;orbed in delight: all feel, in a certain degree, the
rap|tures <PB N="181" REF="192"> of maddening joys. But probably the Wood Grous
is more under the dominion of lu&s;t; for in Germany, the term
<HI>auerhahn</HI> is be|&s;towed on the lover, who neglects every other
concern, and devotes him&s;elf entirely to the ob|ject of his pa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>, and even applied to every per&s;on who
di&s;covers a &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility to his mo&s;t important
intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>It will be readily conceived that the &s;ea&s;on when the Grous is wholly occupied by the amorous pa&s;&s;ions, is the proper time for &s;etting gins, or for hunting it. When I come to treat of the Small Black Grous, I &s;hall de&s;cribe more particularly the precautions ob&s;erved in this &s;port; I &s;hall here only ob&s;erve, that people are attentive in extirpating the old cocks, becau&s;e the&s;e appropriate an exten&s;ive tract, and &s;uffer no rivals to enter the region of their plea&s;ures; and thus many females are deprived of the male influence, and produce addle eggs.</P>
<P>Some bird-catchers pretend, that before the Wood Grous couple, they provide a clean even &s;pot<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>. That &s;uch may occur I have no doubt, but I &s;u&s;pect that the Grous &s;how no fore&s;ight in choice. It is much more natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e &s;pots have been the habitual re&s;ort of the hen and her young, and that after two or three months they become more trodden and flat than the re&s;t of the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="193">
The lea&s;t number of eggs which the female Wood Grous commonly lays, is five or &s;ix; the greate&s;t number, eight or nine. Schwenckfeld a&s;&s;erts, that their fir&s;t hatch is eight, and the &s;ub&s;equent ones amount to twelve, fifteen, or even &s;ixteen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gradation is conformable to the general ob&s;ervation of Ari&s;totle; I &s;u&s;pect only that the number is over-rated.</NOTE>. The&s;e eggs are white, &s;potted with yellow; and, according to the &s;ame author, they are larger than tho&s;e of common hens. The female drops them in a dry &s;pot on the mo&s;s, where it hatches them alone, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the male<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have &s;omewhere read that the time of incubation is twenty-eight days, which is probable, con&s;idering the bulk of the bird.</NOTE>. When it is obliged to leave the eggs, it carefully &s;trews them with leaves; and though it inherits a &s;avage in&s;tinct, the love of progeny &s;eems to blunt the &s;en&s;e of immediate danger, and it continues to &s;it after we have approached it, and can hardly be forced to for&s;ake its eggs.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the young are hatched, they run nimbly, and even before the &s;hell is completely detached. The mother leads them in the mo&s;t careful and attentive manner; &s;he goes with them into the woods, where &s;he feeds them with ants eggs, black-berries, &amp;c. They continue united through the re&s;t of the year, till the return of the &s;ea&s;on of love, in&s;piring them with new ap|petites and inclinations, di&s;per&s;es the family; the males are the wide&s;t &s;eparated, never a&s;&s;ociating
<PB N="183" REF="194">
with their own &s;ex, and &s;eldom mixing with the females but to &s;atiate their lu&s;t.</P>
<P>The Wood Grous delights, as we have already ob&s;erved, in lofty mountains. But this is the ca&s;e only in the milder latitudes; for in coun|tries that are inten&s;ely cold, as Hud&s;on's Bay, they prefer the plains and &s;heltered places; and in &s;uch &s;ituations, they enjoy, in tho&s;e inclement regions, perhaps the &s;ame temperature as on the mo&s;t elevated &s;ummits in the genial climes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t.

<P>It is &s;aid that birds of prey are very de&s;truc|tive to them; either becau&s;e they direct their a&s;&s;aults when the Wood Grous is intoxicated with love, or growing fond of the &s;uperior de|licacy of their fle&s;h, they &s;elect them for their prey. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Wood Grous, <HI>Tetrao-Urogallus:</HI> <Q REND="inline">Its tail is rounded, its axillary feathers white.</Q> Mr. Pennant, who&s;e authority on this &s;ubject is unque&s;tionable, a&s;&s;ures us, that this bird is not found in America.

<HEAD>N^o. 35 THE BLACK GROUS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="185" REF="197"> re&s;embles that of the partridge, but on
account of the colour of the male, which is black, a&s;cribes to it a red
fle&s;h comb, with two barbils of the &s;ame colour and &s;ub&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>. In this a&s;&s;ertion Willughby
in&s;i&s;ts that he was mi&s;taken. But it is difficult to conceive that Turner
could fall into an error with re&s;pect to this bird, which inhabits his own
country, and concerning a character that would be &s;o ea&s;ily noticed. On the
other hand, admitting what Turner &s;ays, I &s;hould re|fer his Moori&s;h hen
to another &s;pecies; or, if we chu&s;e, to another &s;ort of the Black Grous,
analo|gous to the fir&s;t in its general &s;tructure and habits, but
di&s;tingui&s;hed by its undivided tail and its fle&s;h barbils; and what
confirms me in this opinion is, that I find in Ge&s;ner, a bird by the name of
<HI>gallus &s;ylve&s;tris,</HI> which has the&s;e pro|perties; &s;o that we may
con&s;ider it as an indi|vidual of the &s;ame &s;pecies with Turner's Moori&s;h
hen; e&s;pecially, as in this &s;pecies, the male is called the <HI>black
cock</HI> in Scotland, (whence Ge&s;ner received his figure,) and the female
<HI>grey hen</HI>; a circum&s;tance which marks di&s;tinctly the differ|ence of
the plumage of the two &s;exes in this &s;pecies of the Grous.</P>
<P>The Black Grous weighs three or four pounds. It bears a great re&s;emblance to the Wood Grous; it has red eye-lids, rough feet without &s;purs, indented toes, white &s;pot on the wing, &amp;c. But it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by two obvious characters; it
<PB N="186" REF="198">
is much &s;maller, and its tail is forked, the outer feathers being longer, the middle ones bent back|wards. Be&s;ides, the male of the &s;mall &s;pecies is of a deeper and more di&s;tinct black; the red glan|dulous &s;kin above the eyes is broader, but &s;ub|ject to &s;ome variations in the &s;ame individuals at different times, as we &s;hall find in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The female is only two thirds of the &s;ize of the male<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. Its tail is le&s;s forked, and the co|lours of its plumage are &s;o different, that Ge&s;ner was induced to refer it to a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, by the name of <HI>grygallus minor.</HI> This change in the colours of the plumage does not take place till after a certain age; the young males at fir&s;t re&s;emble their mother, and pre&s;erve the &s;ame appearance till the end of the autumn. Towards the clo&s;e of that &s;ea&s;on, and during the winter, the plumage gradually acquires a deeper colour, till it becomes a blui&s;h-black, which is permanent thenceforth, except the &s;light changes which I &s;hall mention. 1. The blue increa&s;es &s;omewhat with age: 2. At the end of three years, and not &s;ooner, a white &s;pot appears under the bill: 3. When they are very old, another &s;pot of a variegated black &s;preads under the tail, where the feathers are all white<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts of Bre&s;lau, Nov. 1725.</BIBL></NOTE>. Charleton, and &s;ome others add, that the number of white &s;pecks on the tail dimini&s;hes regularly with the age of the bird, &s;o as to &s;erve for a mark to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="199">
The naturali&s;ts who unanimou&s;ly reckon twenty-&s;ix quills in the wing of the Black Grous, do not agree &s;o well with re&s;pect to the number of quills in the tail: Schwenckfeld allows eighteen to the female, and only twelve to the male. Willoughby, Albin, and Bri&s;&s;on, be&s;tow &s;ixteen on either &s;ex. The two males pre&s;erved in the Royal Cabinet have each eighteen; viz. &s;even large ones on each &s;ide, and four in the middle much &s;horter.

<P>In both &s;exes the orifice of the ears is wide, the toes are connected by a membrane as high as the fir&s;t articulation, and edged with indent|ing; their fle&s;h is white, and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; the tongue &s;oft, be&s;et with &s;mall points, and not parted; under the tongue is a glandulous &s;ub|&s;tance; in the palate, a cavity corre&s;ponding ex|actly to the dimen&s;ions of the tongue; the craw is very large, the inte&s;tinal tube fifty-one inches long, and the appendices or <HI>caeca</HI> twenty-four; the&s;e fluted with &s;ix <HI>&s;triae</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>.</P>

It is then that the males are ob|&s;erved to a&s;&s;emble by day-break, to the number of a hundred or more, in &s;ome place which is elevated, &s;olitary, &s;urrounded with mar&s;hes, or covered with heath, and this is the field of con|tinual contention; they fight bitterly with each other, till the vanqui&s;hed are driven to flight. The victors then &s;eat them&s;elves on the trunk of a tree, or on a ri&s;ing &s;pot of ground, their eyes fla&s;hing fire, their eye-brows &s;welled, their fea|thers bri&s;tled, their tail expanded like a fan; beating their wings and fri&s;king with wild de|&s;ire<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.&mdash;<BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, they invite their females by a call, which may be heard at half-a-mile's di&s;tance; the na|tural note which re&s;embles the &s;ound of the German word <HI>frau</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>, ri&s;es at this time one third, and is joined with another &s;ingular cry,

The females in the neighbourhood an&s;wer to the voice of the males, by a cry peculiar to them, flock around their mates, and in the following days re&s;ort to the preci&s;e &s;pot. According to Dr. Waygand, each cock has two or three hens, to which he is more particularly attached.</P>
<P>When the females are impregnated, they re|tire to lay their eggs in cop&s;es, which are thick and tall. They drop them on the ground, and, like all the large birds, are at little pains in con|&s;tructing a ne&s;t. They lay &s;ix or &s;even eggs according to &s;ome<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>; from twelve to &s;ixteen<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>; and even from twelve to twenty, according to others<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts of Bre&s;law.</BIBL></NOTE>; the&s;e are not &s;o large as tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic hens, but are &s;omewhat longer &s;haped. Linnaeus a&s;&s;erts, that the female Black Grous lo&s;es its delicate flavour in the time of incuba|tion. Schwenckfeld &s;eems to in&s;inuate that their &s;ea&s;on for laying is now deranged, &s;ince they have been mole&s;ted by the &s;port&s;men, and &s;cared by the reports of the fowling-piece; and to the &s;ame cau&s;es he a&s;cribes the extinction in Germany of many other beautiful &s;pecies of birds.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the chickens are twelve or fifteen days old, they flap their wings, and e&s;&s;ay to fly; but it is five or &s;ix weeks before they are able to ri&s;e from the ground, and then they perch on the
<PB N="192" REF="204">
trees with their mothers. This is the time to decoy them with a call<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This call is made of a bone of the Go&s;hawk, which is filled with wax, and proper holes bored in it. <BIBL>BRESLAW's <HI>Acts.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, to catch them in the net, or to &s;hoot them. The mother mi&s;taking this call for the chirping of her &s;trayed young, runs to the place, and invites them by a particu|lar cry, which &s;he often repeats, like the dome&s;tic fowls in the &s;ame circum&s;tances; &s;he thus col|lects the whole covey, and all become devoted to the mercy of the &s;port&s;men.</P>
<P>As they grow bigger, their plumage gradually a&s;&s;umes a black ca&s;t, and then they are not &s;o ea&s;ily decoyed; but when they have attained half their growth, the falcon is flown at them; and the proper time is about the clo&s;e of autumn, when the trees have &s;hed their leaves. In that &s;ea&s;on, the males &s;elect &s;ome &s;pot, whither they repair every morning at &s;un-ri&s;e, and by a cer|tain cry (e&s;pecially when it is likely to be fro&s;t, or fine weather), they invite all other birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies, of every age and of either &s;ex. When a&s;&s;embled, they fly in flocks to the bu&s;hes; or if there is no &s;now on the ground, they di&s;|per&s;e over the &s;tubble fields, where barley, oats, or other &s;uch grain has been reaped. Then it is that birds of prey trained on purpo&s;e afford ex|cellent &s;port.</P>
<P>Another method of catching this game is prac|ti&s;ed in Courland, Livonia, and Lithuania. They u&s;e a &s;tuffed grous, or an artificial bird made of
<PB N="193" REF="205">
cloth of the proper colour, and &s;tuffed with hay or tow, and this is termed in tho&s;e countries, <HI>balvane.</HI> They fa&s;ten this <HI>balvane</HI> to the end of a &s;tick, and place it on &s;ome birch-tree near the &s;cene of their amours: the time for this &s;port is in the month of April. The birds gather round the <HI>balvane,</HI> and fight with each other in play; at la&s;t they engage in earne&s;t, and are &s;o much occupied in the violence of their contentions, that the &s;port&s;man, who is concealed near the &s;pot in his hut, &s;urpri&s;es them, and catches them, without being obliged to aim a &s;ingle blow. Tho&s;e caught in this way, he tames in the &s;pace of five or &s;ix days; &s;o that they will come to eat out of his hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this re&s;pect the Little Grous differs widely from the Great Grous, which, far from &s;ubmitting to dome&s;tication, con&s;tantly re|jects what is offered it to eat.</NOTE>. On the following year in the &s;pring, they make u&s;e of tho&s;e tame birds, in|&s;tead of <HI>balvanes,</HI> to decoy the wild Black Grous, which fall upon them, and fight with &s;uch fury as not to be &s;cared by the report of a fowling-piece. Each morning they repair by day-break to the common rendezvous, and re|main there till &s;un-ri&s;e, when they fly away and di&s;per&s;e through the fore&s;ts and heaths in &s;earch of food. About three o'clock in the afternoon, they return to the &s;ame &s;pot. and continue there till late in the evening. This is their regular cour&s;e of life, e&s;pecially in fair weather, during the &s;ea&s;on of love, which la&s;ts three or four
<PB N="194" REF="206">
weeks; but when it is rainy or cold, they are rather more retired.</P>
<P>The young Black Grous have al&s;o their fa|vourite &s;pot of re&s;ort, where they a&s;&s;emble in flocks of forty or fifty at a time, and devote them&s;elves to nearly the &s;ame amu&s;ements or occupations; their voice however is hoar&s;er, and broken; and they do not leap with equal agility. Their meeting la&s;ts only eight days, after which they join the old ones.</P>
<P>When the &s;ea&s;on of love is over, and con&s;e|quently their a&s;&s;emblies le&s;s regular, new &s;tra|tagems mu&s;t be employed to decoy them near the hut where is the <HI>balvane.</HI> Several &s;port&s;men on hor&s;eback enclo&s;e a circuit of variable extent, having the hut for its centre, and cracking their whips, they drive the Grous from bu&s;h to bu&s;h, and &s;o gradually contract the bounds, and, by means of a whi&s;tle, they inform the per&s;on who manages the <HI>balvane</HI> of their approach. The Grous, when they &s;hift from one bu&s;h to an|other, di&s;tingui&s;h accurately tho&s;e branches which are able to &s;upport them, not even ex|cepting the vertical &s;hoots, which bend with their weight into an horizontal &s;ituation; after alight|ing they li&s;ten attentively, &s;tretching out their neck to learn if they are in a place of &s;afety, and as &s;oon as they have allayed their fears, they begin to pluck the tender buds. The dexterous &s;port&s;man then &s;eizes the opportunity of placing his <HI>balvane</HI> on the neighbouring twigs, and
<PB N="195" REF="207">
fixing a cord, he pulls it from time to time, &s;o as to imitate the waving motions of the Grous, &s;itting on a flexible branch. Experience al&s;o in&s;tructs him to turn the head of the <HI>balvanes</HI> again&s;t the wind when it blows violently; but in &s;till wea|ther, he finds it be&s;t to place them oppo&s;ite to each other. If the Grous are driven &s;traight towards his hut, he can di&s;cover by an ea&s;y ob|&s;ervation, whether they will perch within his reach. If their flight is irregular, if they &s;ome|times approach and &s;ometimes retire, flapping their wings, he concludes, that perhaps the whole flock, or at lea&s;t part of them, will alight near him. On the other hand, if they &s;pring not far from his hut, and &s;hoot in a rapid &s;teady cour&s;e, he is certain that they will pu&s;h on to a di&s;tance. When the Grous &s;ettle near the hut, the fowler is informed at lea&s;t thrice by their repeated cries; he is then cautious not to fire upon them too &s;uddenly; he remains &s;till in his hut, and with|out making the lea&s;t noi&s;e, allowing the birds time to examine their &s;ituation, and to quiet their apprehen&s;ions. When they are &s;ettled and begin to feed, he takes his aim &s;teadily, and fires. But however numerous the flock be, though it even amount to fifty or a hundred, he can hardly ex|pect to kill more than one or two at each &s;hot; for the&s;e birds do not group together, but com|monly perch on a &s;eparate tree, and hence &s;traggling bu&s;hes are better for the &s;port than a thick fore&s;t. However, when there is no &s;now
<PB N="196" REF="208">
lying on the ground, this amu&s;ement is &s;ometimes taken in open &s;tubble fields, the crops of oats, barley, buck-wheat, being led, the hut is covered with &s;traw; there the &s;port is tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful, except in &s;evere weather, when the&s;e birds are di&s;per&s;ed and concealed. But the fir&s;t fine day that &s;ucceeds makes them more ea&s;ily caught; and a &s;hooter, who has taken his &s;tation properly, can, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of hor&s;emen, and with bird-calls alone, entice them to his hut with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted that, when the&s;e birds fly in flocks, they are led by an old cock, who con|ducts them like an experienced chief, and teaches them to &s;hun the decoys of the &s;port&s;men; &s;o that in this ca&s;e it is exceedingly difficult to drive them to the <HI>balvane,</HI> and all that can be then expected is to intercept a few of the &s;tragglers.</P>
<P>The proper time for the &s;port is from &s;un-ri&s;e to ten o'clock in the forenoon; and from one o'clock in the afternoon to four. But in autumn, when the air is &s;till and clo&s;e, it may be continued without interruption through the whole day; for the Grous then &s;eldom &s;hift their place. And in this way, they may be cha&s;ed from tree to tree, till near the winter &s;ol&s;tice; about that time they grow more wild, &s;hy, and cunning; they even change their accu&s;tomed haunt, unle&s;s they are confined by the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="209">
It is &s;aid to be a &s;ign of fair weather, when the Grous &s;it on the tops of the trees, and upon the young &s;hoots; but if they de&s;cend to the lower branches, and &s;quat, it forebodes an approaching &s;torm. I &s;hould not take notice of the&s;e remarks of the &s;port&s;men, if they did not corre&s;pond with the in&s;tincts of the&s;e birds, which, from what we have already &s;een, mu&s;t be very &s;u&s;ceptible of the impre&s;&s;ions made by the varying &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, and who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility in this re&s;pect may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o great, con&s;i&s;tently with pro|bability, as to be affected by the change which decides the nature of the following day.</P>
<P>When the weather is exce&s;&s;ively rainy, they retire for &s;helter into the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t bu&s;hy fore&s;ts, and as they are tardy and laborious in their flight, they can &s;ometimes be hunted down with dogs, which exhau&s;t them, and catch them by &s;peed of foot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bre&s;law's Acts for 1725.</BIBL> This unwieldine&s;s has been re|marked by Pliny; and was meant to apply both perhaps to the Great and the Small Grous.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In other countries, the Black Grous is, ac|cording to Aldrovandus, caught with a noo&s;e; a net is al&s;o u&s;ed, as has been already ob&s;erved; but it would be curious to know the &s;hape, dimen|&s;ions, and con&s;truction of the one with which the Poli&s;h nobleman, of whom Rzaczyn&s;ki &s;peaks, caught two hundred and &s;ixty at one time. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Black Grous, <HI>Tetrao-Tetrix:</HI> <Q REND="inline">Its Stail is forked, its &s;econd wing-quills white near the ba&s;e.</Q> Its egg is yellowi&s;h, &s;potted with dark red.

They lay a number of poles horizontally on forked &s;ticks in the open birch fore&s;ts, and &s;et &s;mall bundles of corn on them. At a &s;hort di&s;tance they plant tall ba&s;kets &s;haped like an invented cone, and place in the mouth of the&s;e a little wheel that turns freely on its axis. The Black Grous are attracted by the corn, alight on the poles, and after a ha&s;ty repa&s;t, fly to the ba&s;kets, perch upon the rim of the wheel, which, giving way, precipitates them into the trap.</NOTE><PB N="198" REF="210"></P>

<P>I HAVE, in the preceding article, &s;tated the rea&s;ons which have induced me to refer this bird to a di&s;tinct family. Ge&s;ner &s;peaks of it by the name of <HI>Wood-cock, (gallus &s;ylve&s;tris),</HI> as a bird having red barbils, and a broad undi|vided tail. He adds, that the male is called <HI>Wood-cock</HI> in Scotland, and the female <HI>Grey-hen.</HI> It is true indeed, that this author, conceiving that the two &s;exes cannot differ much in the co|lour of their plumage, tran&s;lates Grey-hen by <HI>gallina fu&s;ca</HI> or <HI>Du&s;ky-hen,</HI> in order to bring them to a nearer conformity; and re&s;ting on this erroneous ver&s;ion, he concludes that this &s;pecies is quite di&s;tinct from the Moori&s;h hen of Turner, becau&s;e he imagines this bird is too widely removed, by the colour of its plumage, from the male to belong to the &s;ame family. But the fact is, that the male is almo&s;t always en|tirely black, and the female is nearly the &s;ame colour with the gray partridge; and this circum|&s;tance completely decides its identity with the Black Cock of Scotland; for even Ge&s;ner admits, that in other re&s;pects they are perfectly alike. The only difference that I can perceive is, that
<PB N="200" REF="212">
the Scotch Black Cock has &s;mall red &s;pots under the brea&s;t, the wings, and the thighs; but we have &s;een in the preceding article, that the young males which in the end become black, are at fir&s;t of the colour of the mother, and perhaps the &s;mall red &s;pots mentioned by Ge&s;ner, are only the traces of their infant plumage before they have acquired the deep jet.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on why Bri&s;&s;on &s;hould confound this tribe or variety, as he calls it, with the <HI>tetrao,</HI> dotted with white, of Linnaeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> No. 167.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;ince one of the characters of this bird, which is termed by the Swedes <HI>rackle-hane,</HI> is its having a forked|tail. Be&s;ides, Linnaeus gives it no barbils, which, according to the figure and de&s;cription of Ge&s;ner, belong to the other birds.</P>
<P>Nor can I &s;ee why Bri&s;&s;on, though he cla&s;&s;es the&s;e two tribes together, makes only one variety of the forked-tail Black Grous; &s;ince, be&s;ides the differences that have been ju&s;t noticed, Lin|naeus expre&s;sly mentions, that his Grous &s;prin|kled with white, is more &s;hy and wild, and has a quite different cry; which implies, I &s;hould imagine, characters deeply impre&s;&s;ed, and more permanent than what con&s;titute a mere variety.</P>
<P>It would appear therefore more con&s;i&s;tent to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e into two &s;pecies of Black Grous; the one including the Scotch Black Cock, and Tur|ner's Moori&s;h Hen; and the other, characterized by the &s;mall white &s;pots under the brea&s;t, and
<PB N="201" REF="213">
its different cry, would comprehend the Swedi&s;h <HI>rackle-hane.</HI> Thus we might reckon four &s;pecies of the genus of Grous. 1. The Wood Grous: 2. The Forked-tail Black Grous: 3. The <HI>Rack|lan,</HI> or <HI>Racklehane,</HI> of Sweden, de&s;cribed by Lin|naeus: 4. The Moori&s;h Hen of Turner, or the Black Cock of Scotland; with fle&s;h barbils on both &s;ides of the bill, and with an uniform tail.&mdash;The&s;e four &s;pecies are all natives of the northern climates, and re&s;ide either in fore&s;ts of pine or of birch. The third only, or the Swedi&s;h <HI>rackle-hane,</HI> is the only one that might be con&s;idered as a variety of the Black Grous, if Linnaeus had not a&s;certained its having a different note.</P>

<P>THE Wood Grous are common in Lapland, e&s;pecially when the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, or the exce&s;&s;ive multiplication of their numbers, compels them to leave the fore&s;ts of Sweden and Scandinavia, and advance into the polar tracts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>. Yet they have never been found white in tho&s;e frozen regions; the colour of their plumage &s;eems to be fixed and permanent, and to re&s;i&s;t the operation of cold. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the Little or Black Grous, which are fre|quent in Courland, and the north of Poland; but Dr. Weigandt, the Je&s;uit Rzaczyn&s;ki, and Klein, affirm that there is in Courland another kind of the &s;ame, termed <HI>White Grous,</HI> which, however, become white only in winter, and by the return of &s;ummer, acquire a reddi&s;h-brown colour, according to Dr. Weigandt; but a blui&s;h-grey, according to Rzaczyn&s;ki. The&s;e variations take place generally in both &s;exes; &s;o that at all times the individuals have preci&s;ely
<PB N="203" REF="215">
the &s;ame colours. They do not perch on trees like the other Grous, but delight in thick bru&s;h|wood and heath; and generally &s;elect each year a certain &s;pot, to which they commonly re&s;ort when di&s;per&s;ed by &s;port&s;men, by birds of prey, or by the violence of a &s;torm. If we hunt them, we ought, when they are fir&s;t &s;prung, to ob&s;erve carefully their place of &s;helter, &s;ince this will certainly be their rendezvous through|out the year; and it will be more difficult to &s;pring them a &s;econd time, for they will ra|ther &s;quat on the ground, and endeavour to con|ceal them&s;elves, in which ca&s;e it will be ea&s;y to &s;hoot them.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that they differ from the Black Grous, not only by their colour, and by the uniformity which obtains between the male and female, but in their habits, &s;ince they never perch. They are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ptarmigans, becau&s;e they inhabit not the lofty mountains, but re&s;ide in the woods and among the heaths; nor are their legs clothed to the toes with feathers. I mu&s;t indeed con|fe&s;s, that I would rather have ranked it with the Red Grous, did I not &s;ubmit to the opinion of the&s;e three intelligent writers, who &s;peak of a bird that is a native of their own country.</P>

<P>WHAT Varro has &s;aid concerning the Ru&s;tic or Wild Hen, applies &s;o accurately to the Hazel Grous, that Belon does not he&s;itate to conclude that they were the &s;ame. It was, according to Varro, a bird uncommonly rare at Rome; and &s;o difficult to tame, that it could only be rai&s;ed in cages, and &s;eldom or never laid eggs in this &s;tate of captivity.

number of tail quills. The tail is marked near its extremity by a broad
blacki&s;h bar, in|terrupted only by the two middle quills. I &s;hould not take

that in mo&s;t birds the two middle quills do not follow the di&s;tance of the
lateral ones, but &s;ometimes project beyond them, and &s;ometimes extend not
&s;o far; &s;o that in this ca&s;e, the interruption of colour appears to
de|pend on the difference of their po&s;ition.&mdash;Like the other Grous,
their orbits are red; the toes indented on the &s;ides, though more &s;lightly;

We find in their &s;tomach, in the &s;ummer, the berries of the &s;ervice-tree, of the bilberry, the bramble, and the heath; the &s;eeds of the Alpine elder, the pods of the <HI>&s;al|tarella,</HI> the catkins of the birch and of the hazel, &amp;c.; and in winter, we meet with juniper berries, the buds of the birch, the tops of heath, fir, juniper, and of &s;ome other ever|greens<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ray, Schwenckfeld, and Rzaczyn&s;ki.</NOTE>. When the Hazel Grous is kept in confinement, it may be fed with wheat, barley,
<PB N="207" REF="220">
and other grain; but, like the Common Grous, it does not long &s;urvive the lo&s;s of its liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner and Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>; whether becau&s;e it is &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;ely as to affect its health, or that its &s;avage, or rather generous nature, will not brook the &s;lighte&s;t encroachment on its freedom.</P>
<P>The time of &s;port returns twice a-year, in &s;pring and in autumn; but the latter &s;ea&s;on is the mo&s;t favourable. They are attracted by the &s;ound of bird-calls which imitate their note, and hor&s;es are led into the field, becau&s;e it is a vulgar opinion, that the Hazel Grous are fond of the&s;e animals<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>. It has al&s;o been re|marked by the &s;port&s;men, that if the cock be fir&s;t caught, the hen &s;eeks her mate with anxious &s;olicitude, and returns &s;everal times to vi&s;it the &s;pot, with other males in her train; but if the hen be fir&s;t en&s;nared, the cock joins another family, and totally forgets his former attachments<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Certain it is, that when one of the&s;e birds is &s;urpri&s;ed and rou&s;ed, it &s;prings, making a loud noi&s;e, and, perching on a tree, it &s;its motionle&s;s and unconcerned, while the &s;port&s;man meditates its de&s;truction. Common|ly they &s;ettle on the centre of the tree, where the boughs part from the trunk.</P>
<P>As much has been &s;aid of the Hazel Grous, many fables have been told: the mo&s;t ab&s;urd
<PB N="208" REF="221">
are tho&s;e concerning its manner of propagating. Encelius, and others, a&s;&s;ert that they copulate with their bills, that the cocks them&s;elves lay when they grow old, and that their eggs being hatched by the toads, produce wild ba&s;ili&s;ks, in the &s;ame manner as the eggs of the common cocks, if hatched by toads, give birth to the do|me&s;tic ba&s;ili&s;ks. And le&s;t we &s;hould entertain &s;u&s;picions with regard to the&s;e ba&s;ili&s;ks, En|celius de&s;cribes one that he &s;aw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>; but un|fortunately he neither tells us whether he be|held it emerge from the egg, or beheld this egg excluded by the male. Mo&s;t of the&s;e ab|&s;urdities take their ri&s;e from the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion of facts; and it is probable that the Hazel Grous bill like the turtle doves, and toy with each other to rai&s;e the &s;well of love.</P>
<P>According to the opinion of &s;port&s;men, the Hazel Grous comes in &s;ea&s;on in the months of October and November; and at that time the males only are killed, being decoyed by a kind of whi&s;tling analogous to the &s;hrill note of the females; they ha&s;ten to the &s;pot, making a loud ru&s;tling noi&s;e with their wings, and are &s;hot as &s;oon as they alight.</P>
<P>The females, like other large birds, form their ne&s;t on the ground, and commonly con|ceal it under hazels, or below the &s;hade of a
<PB N="209" REF="222">
broad mountain fern. They commonly lay twelve or fifteen eggs, and &s;ometimes even twenty, and the&s;e are &s;omewhat larger than pigeons eggs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. They &s;it three weeks, and have &s;eldom more than &s;even or eight young<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>, which run as &s;oon as they are hatched, as u&s;ual in mo&s;t of the &s;hort-winged birds. As &s;oon as the young are able to fly, the parents remove from the tract where they bred; and being thus for&s;aken, they pair and di&s;per&s;e, to form new &s;ettlements, and in their turn to &s;end off other colonies<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Hazel Grous delight in fore&s;ts, where they can find their proper &s;u&s;tenance, and con|ceal them&s;elves from the rapacious birds, which they dread exceedingly, and perch, for &s;helter, on the low branches<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

<P>IF this bird be the &s;ame with the <HI>Gallus palu&s;tris</HI> of Ge&s;ner, as Bri&s;&s;on thinks, the figure which the German naturali&s;t gives, mu&s;t undoubtedly be very inaccurate, &s;ince no feathers are repre&s;ented on the legs; and, on the other hand, red barbils appear under the bill. Is it not natural then to &s;u&s;pect that this figure be|longs to a different bird? However, the <HI>Wood|cock,</HI> or <HI>Cock of the Mar&s;h,</HI> is excellent meat; and all that we know of its hi&s;tory is, that it delights in wet &s;ituations, as its name denotes. The Authors of the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, that what Bri&s;&s;on takes for the <HI>Scotch Hazel Grous,</HI> is really the <HI>Ptarmigan</HI> in its &s;ummer garb, and that its plumage becomes almo&s;t always white in winter. But if this were the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t al&s;o lo&s;e the feathers which cover the toes; for Bri&s;&s;on expre&s;sly notices, that it is only clothed to the origin of the toes, and the ptarmigan in the Briti&s;h Zoology is feathered even to the nails; be&s;ides, the&s;e two birds, as they are re|pre&s;ented in the Zoology, and in Bri&s;&s;on's work, re&s;emble each other neither in appear|ance nor &s;tructure.

I need take no notice of the colours of the plumage, the figure will convey a clearer idea than any de&s;cription; and be&s;ides, nothing is more un|certain, &s;ince they vary con&s;iderably in the &s;ame individual at different &s;ea&s;ons.</P>

<P>THOUGH there is a wide difference between words and things, it often happens in na|tural hi&s;tory, that the mi&s;application of terms is the &s;ource of multiplied mi&s;takes; we have therefore made it an invariable rule, to di&s;co|ver, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the true meaning of names.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on, con&s;idering the Dama&s;cus or Syrian Partridge of Belon, as the &s;ame &s;pecies with his Pyrenean Hazel Grous, ranges it among the appellations be&s;towed in different languages on that tribe, and quotes Belon as his authority for the Greek name <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. But he is mi&s;|taken in two points: Fir&s;t, Belon tells us him&s;elf, that the bird which he calls <HI>the Dama&s;cus Par|tridge,</HI> is a different &s;pecies from what authors term <HI>Syroperdrix,</HI> which has a black plumage and a
<PB N="214" REF="228">
red bill. Secondly, Bri&s;&s;on, writing the word in Greek characters, &s;eems to in&s;inuate that it is de|rived from that language, while Belon po&s;itively mentions that it is originally Latin. La&s;tly, it is difficult to conceive what led Bri&s;&s;on to con&s;ider the <HI>aenas</HI> of Ari&s;totle as the &s;ame &s;pecies with his Pyrenean Hazel Grous; for Ari&s;totle cla&s;&s;es his <HI>aenas,</HI> which is the <HI>vinago</HI> of Gaza, with the pigeons, the turtles, and the ring-doves, (in which he is followed by all the Arabians,) and he expre&s;sly mentions that, like the&s;e birds, it only lays two eggs at a time. But we have already &s;een that the Hazel Grous lays a much greater number; and con&s;equently the <HI>aenas</HI> of Ari&s;totle cannot be con&s;idered as the Pyrenean Hazel Grous, and ought therefore to be referred to a different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Rondelet conceived, that the Greek word was not <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, but ought to be read <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, who&s;e pri|mitive &s;ignifies a <HI>fibre</HI> or <HI>thread</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>; becau&s;e the fle&s;h is &s;o fibrous and hard that it mu&s;t be flead before it can be eaten. But if it were really the &s;ame bird with the Pyrenean Hazel Grous, we might adopt the correction of Ron|delet, and yet give to the word <HI>inas</HI> a more happy explanation, and more con&s;i&s;tent with the genius of the Greek language, which paints whatever it would expre&s;s; if we conceive it to denote the two threads or narrow feathers of the
<PB N="215" REF="229">
tail of the Pyrenean Hazel Grous, and which is their characteri&s;tical di&s;tinction. But unfor|tunately Ari&s;totle does not &s;ay a word concern|ing the&s;e threads, which had e&s;caped his ob&s;erva|tion; nor does Belon take any notice of this circum&s;tance in his de&s;cription of the Dama&s;cus partridge. Be&s;ides, the name <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, wine.</NOTE>, or <HI>vinago,</HI> is more &s;uitable to this bird, as it arrives in Greece about the beginning of autumn, which is the &s;ea&s;on of vintage; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that in Burgundy a certain kind of thru&s;hes are called by the people in that county <HI>vinettes.</HI></P>
<P>It follows from what has been &s;aid, that the <HI>&s;yroperdrix</HI> of Belon, and the <HI>oenas</HI> of Ari&s;totle, are not the Pyrenean Hazel or Pin-tailed Grous, any more than the <HI>alchata, alfuachat,</HI> and the <HI>filacotona,</HI> which appear to be Arabian names, and certainly denote a bird of the pigeon kind.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Syrian bird, which Edwards terms <HI>the little heath-cock, with two thread-like feathers in the tail,</HI> and which the Turks call <HI>kata,</HI> is really the &s;ame with the Pyrenean Hazel-Grous. This author tells us, that Dr. Shaw names it <HI>kittawiah,</HI> and that he only gives three toes to each foot; but he alleges that the traveller has committed this over&s;ight in not attending to the hind toe, which is hid under the plumage of the legs. Yet he had a little before mentioned, (and we readily
<PB N="216" REF="230">
perceive it from the figure,) that the fore-part only of the leg is covered with white feathers like hairs; and it is difficult to conceive how the hind toe could be concealed under the an|terior plumage. It would be more natural to &s;ay, that it e&s;caped Dr. Shaw's ob&s;ervation, by its diminutive &s;ize, for it is only two lines long. The two lateral toes are al&s;o very &s;hort com|pared with the middle one, and in them all, the edges are marked with &s;mall indentings, as in the common Grous. The Pin-tailed or Pyre|nean Hazel Grous, &s;eems therefore to be quite a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the true Hazel Grous. For, 1. its wings are much broader in propor|tion to the re&s;t of its body, and con&s;equently it mu&s;t fly &s;moothly and rapidly, and have habits different from tho&s;e of tardy birds. 2. We learn from the ob&s;ervations of Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, quoted by Edwards, that it flies in numerous flocks, and &s;pends the greate&s;t part of the year in the de&s;erts of Syria, and does not venture near the city of Aleppo, except in the months of May and June, when it is obliged to re&s;ort to places where it can get water. We know too that the Hazel Grous is a timorous bird, and never deems it&s;elf &s;ecure from the vultures talons, unle&s;s concealed in the mo&s;t &s;hady trees. The Pin-tailed Grous, which the inhabitants of Catalonia call the <HI>partridge of Garrira</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Barrere, <HI>Ornithologia.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, is nearly the bulk of the gray partridge;
<PB N="217" REF="231">
the orbits are black, nor are the eye-brows red or flame coloured; the bill is almo&s;t &s;traight; the no&s;trils are placed at the ba&s;e of the upper mandible, and joining the feathers which cover the face; the fore-part of the leg is feathered to the origin of the toes; the wings are of con&s;iderable length, and the &s;hafts of the quills are black; the two quills in the middle of the tail are twice as long as the re&s;t, and very narrow where they project; the lateral quills grow &s;horter and &s;horter until the la&s;t one. We may remark that of all the&s;e properties which characteri&s;e the pretended Ha|zel Grous of the Pyrenees, there is not one which exactly agrees with the Hazel Grous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards and Bri&s;&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The female is of the &s;ame &s;ize with the male, but differs by its plumage, the colours of which are fainter, and by the filaments in the tail, which are not &s;o long. It appears that the male has a black &s;pot under its throat, and that the female, in&s;tead of this, has three rings of the &s;ame colour, which encircle its neck like a collar.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe the colours of the plumage; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that they have a great affinity to tho&s;e of the bird known at Montpelier by the name of <HI>angel,</HI> of which John Culmann communicated a de&s;cription to Ge&s;ner<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">The feathers are of a du&s;ky colour inclining to black and yellowi&s;h, verging on rufous,</Q> &s;ays Ge&s;ner, &s;peaking of the <HI>angel.</HI></P>

&s;eem to be omitted in this de&s;cription, and al&s;o in the figure &s;ent by
Rondelet to Ge&s;ner, of this &s;ame bird, which he had taken for the
<HI>oenas</HI> of Ari&s;totle. In &s;hort, there &s;eems to be rea&s;on to
doubt the identity of the&s;e two &s;pecies, notwith|&s;tanding their
corre&s;pondence in the plumage and in the place of re&s;idence; unle&s;s we
&s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ubjects de&s;cribed by Culmann and de&s;igned by
Rondelet were females, in which the threads of the tail were much &s;horter,
and con&s;equently le&s;s remarkable.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies is found in mo&s;t of the warm countries in the ancient continent; in Spain, in the &s;outh of France, in Italy, in Syria, in Turkey and Arabia, in Barbary, and even at Senegal; for the bird figured in the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es</HI> by the name of the Senegal Hazel Grous, is only a variety, and &s;omewhat &s;maller, but has the &s;ame long feathers or threads in the tail, the lateral quills become gradually &s;horter the farther they are placed from the middle, the wings are very long, the legs covered before with a white down, the mid-toe much longer than tho&s;e near the &s;ides, and the hind one ex|ceedingly &s;hort; la&s;tly, it has no red &s;kin over the eyes, and differs from the Pin-tailed Grous only in being rather &s;maller, and its plumage deeper tinged with reddi&s;h. It is therefore only
<PB N="219" REF="233">
a variety of the &s;ame &s;pecies, produced by the influence of climate; and what ought to &s;hew that this bird is different from the Hazel Grous, and &s;hould therefore be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a dif|frent name, is, that be&s;ides the di&s;parity of figure, it always inhabits the warm countries, and never occurs in the cold or even the tem|perate climates; whereas the Hazel Grous are rare except in chilly tracts.</P>
<P>It may be proper in this place to tran&s;cribe what Dr. Shaw informs us with re&s;pect to the <HI>Kittawiah,</HI> or Barbary Hazel Grous, and which is all we know on the &s;ubject, that the reader may compare it with the Pin-tailed Grous, or the Pyrenean Hazel Grous, and judge if they are really two individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>

<P>THIS is Belon's <HI>francolin,</HI> which we mu&s;t not confound, as &s;ome ornithologi&s;ts have done, with the <HI>francolin</HI> de&s;cribed by Olina. The&s;e are two birds widely different both in their form and in their habits: the la&s;t delights in plains and low &s;ituations; it has not the beau|tiful flame-coloured orbits, that give the other &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed an appearance; its neck is &s;horter and its body thicker; the feet reddi&s;h, furni&s;hed with &s;purs, and not feathered, as its toes are not indented; in &s;hort, it bears no re&s;emblance at all to the bird which we at pre&s;ent con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The ancients have &s;aid a great deal about the <HI>attagas,</HI> or <HI>attagen</HI> (for they u&s;e both names in|differently). Alexander the Myndian tells us in his commentary on Athenaeus, that it was rather larger than a partridge, and its plumage, which was of a reddi&s;h ground, was mottled with &s;e|veral
<PB N="222" REF="236">
colours. Ari&s;tophanes had &s;aid nearly the &s;ame thing; but Ari&s;totle, according to his commendable cu&s;tom of marking the analogy between unknown objects and &s;uch as are com|mon, compares its plumage to that of the wood|cock (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">). Alexander the Myndian &s;ubjoins, that its wings are &s;hort, and its flight tardy; and Theophra&s;tus remarks that, like the other heavy birds, as the partridge, the cock, the phea&s;ant, &amp;c. it is hatched without feathers, and can run as &s;oon as it quits the &s;hell. Like the&s;e al&s;o, it welters in the du&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancients called the&s;e birds <HI>Pulveratrices,</HI> which roll in du&s;t to rid them&s;elves of the in&s;ects that torment them; in the &s;ame manner as the aquatic fowls &s;eek to remove them by &s;prink|ling water on their wings.</NOTE>, and feeds on fruits, devour|ing the berries and grain which it finds, &s;ome|times eating the plants them&s;elves, &s;ometimes &s;craping the earth with its nails; and as it runs more than it flies, it was cu&s;tomary to hunt it with dogs, and this cha&s;e was &s;ucce&s;sful<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Oppian <HI>in Ixeuticis.</HI></BIBL> This author adds, that they are fond of &s;tags, and, on the contrary, have an aver&s;ion to cocks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Pliny, Aelian, and others &s;ay, that the&s;e birds lo&s;e their cry with their liberty; and that, owing to the depre&s;&s;ion of their native faculties, they are very difficult to tame. Varro, however, in|&s;tructs us how to breed them, and the mode is nearly the &s;ame with that of rai&s;ing peacocks, phea&s;ants, Guinea fowls, partridges, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Pliny informs us, that this bird, which had been very rare, was become more common in
<PB N="223" REF="237">
his time; that it was found in Spain, in Gaul, and on the Alps; but that tho&s;e from Ionia were the mo&s;t e&s;teemed. In another place, he tells us, that there were none in the i&s;land of Crete. Ari&s;tophanes &s;peaks of tho&s;e found in the vicinity of Megara in Achaia. Clement of Alexandria &s;ays, that tho&s;e from Egypt were reckoned the mo&s;t delicious by the epicures. Some there were al&s;o in Phrygia, according to Aulus Gellius, who de&s;cribes it as an A&s;iatic bird.

<P>It appears that the word <HI>attagen,</HI> though with various corruptions, has generally been u&s;ed by the modern authors who have written in Latin, as the name of this bird<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Attago, Actago, Atago, Atchemigi, Atacuigi, Tagenarios, Tagi|nari,</HI> are all words corrupted from <HI>Attagen.</HI> Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>.

idea, is it likely that this great naturali&s;t, who had treated at great length on the <HI>attagen</HI> in the &s;ame chapter, would &s;ay a few words of it afterwards under another name, and without giving notice? This reflection is alone &s;ufficient, in my opinion, to prove that the <HI>attagen</HI> of Pliny and his <HI>lagopus altera</HI> were different birds; and we &s;hall afterwards know what they really were.</P>
<P>Ge&s;ner was told, that this bird is commonly called <HI>franguello</HI> at Bologna; but Aldrovan|dus, who was a native of that place, tells us, that the name <HI>franguello </HI>(<HI>hinguello,</HI> according to Olina), was given commonly to the chaf|finch, and which is evidently derived from the Latin <HI>fringilla.</HI> Olina &s;ubjoins, that in Italy, his <HI>francolin,</HI> which we have &s;aid is a bird different from ours, was generally named <HI>franguellina</HI>; a word corrupted from <HI>frangolino,</HI> and to which a feminine termination was added, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>fringuello.</HI></P>
<P>I know not why Albin, who has copied the de&s;cription that Willughby gives of the <HI>lagopus altera</HI> of Pliny, has changed the name into <HI>Cock of the Mar&s;h</HI>; unle&s;s becau&s;e Tournefort &s;ays, that the Samian <HI>francolin</HI> haunts mar&s;hes. But if we compare the de&s;criptions with the figures, we &s;hall readily perceive that the Samian <HI>fran|colin</HI> is entirely different from the bird which Albin, or his tran&s;lator, has been plea&s;ed to term
<PB N="225" REF="239">
<HI>Cock of the Mar&s;h,</HI> &s;ince he had before applied the name of <HI>francolin</HI> to this Forked-tail Black Grous.

But the female has le&s;s of the red, and more of the white, than the male; the membrane of the orbits not &s;o prominent, much le&s;s pared, and of a fainter red; in general, the colours of its plumage are more dilute<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>; be&s;ides, it has not tho&s;e black feathers dotted with white, which in the male form the tuft on the head, and a kind of beard under the bill<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>.</P>

Belon tells us, that in his time <HI>francolins</HI> (that is Red Grous) were brought from Venice, &s;ome of which had the plumage we have de&s;cribed, and others were entirely white, and were called in Italy by the &s;ame name.

<P>The Red Grous is indeed an inhabitant of the elevated tracts. Willughby informs us, that it &s;eldom ventures into the low country, nor even de&s;cends to the &s;loping &s;ides of the mountain, but prefers to re&s;ide on the loftie&s;t &s;ummits.

<P>Although this bird is naturally very &s;hy, the &s;ecret of breeding them in cages has been di&s;|covered in the i&s;land of Cyprus, as formerly at Rome; at lea&s;t, if the bird &s;poken of by Alexander Benedictus is the Red Grous.

<P>THIS bird has been called the <HI>White Par|tridge,</HI> very improperly; &s;ince it is not a partridge, and is white only in winter, on ac|count of the inten&s;e cold to which it is expo&s;ed during that &s;ea&s;on on the lofty mountains of the North, which it commonly inhabits. Ari&s;totle, who was unacquainted with the Ptarmigan, knew that partridges, quails, &s;wallows, &s;par|rows, ravens, and even hares, &s;tags, and bears, &s;uffer, in &s;imilar &s;ituations, the &s;ame change of colour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De coloribus,</HI> cap. vi.</BIBL> and <BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t.

Attagas, according to Belon, are liable to the &s;ame va|riations of colour. It
is a&s;toni&s;hing that Fri&s;ch was not informed, that his <HI>White Mountain
Francolin,</HI> which is the Ptarmigan, is &s;ubject to this influence of cold;
for if he was acquainted with this fact, it is equally &s;trange that he has
omitted to mention it. He only &s;ays, that he was told that no White
Francolins could be met with in &s;ummer; and therefore he tells us, that they
were &s;ometimes found (in &s;ummer no doubt) with their wings and back brown,
but which he had never &s;een. This was the place, therefore, where he ought to
have added, that they are white only in winter, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle, as I have already &s;aid, was unac|quainted with the Ptarmigan; what demon|&s;trates the a&s;&s;ertion, is a pa&s;&s;age in his Natural Hi&s;tory, where he &s;ays, that the hare is the only animal who&s;e feet are covered with fur on the &s;ole; but, if he had known the fact, he would certainly not have omitted, in a place where he draws general compari&s;ons, to mention a bird that is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame property.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="249">
The name <HI>Lagopus</HI> is that which Pliny and other writers of antiquity have be&s;towed on this &s;pecies of birds. The moderns have there|fore committed an impropriety, when they have applied a word which marks the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the Ptarmigan to the nocturnal birds, who&s;e feet are feathered above and not below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, Willughby, and Klein.</NOTE>. Pliny adds, that it is as large as a pigeon, that it is white, that it is excellent, and that it re&s;ides on the &s;ummits of the Alps; la&s;tly, that it is &s;o wild that it can hardly be reduced to the dome&s;tic &s;tate; and he concludes with telling us, that its fle&s;h &s;oon runs into putre|faction.</P>
<P>The laborious accuracy of the moderns has completed this &s;ketch of antiquity. They have noticed that glandulous &s;kin which forms a &s;ort of red eye-brows, but of a brighter colour in the male than in the female; it is al&s;o &s;maller in the latter, and the two black &s;treaks are want|ing on the head, which in the male &s;tretch from the bottom of the bill to the eyes, and even extend near the ears. Except in this cir|cum&s;tance, the male and female are perfectly alike in their external form; and all that I &s;hall afterwards mention on this &s;ubject will apply to both equally.</P>
<P>The &s;nowy colour of the Ptarmigan is not &s;pread over its whole body, but is &s;tained even
<PB N="235" REF="250">
in winter. This exception obtains e&s;pecially in the quills of the tail, which are black, with a little white at the point; nor does it appear from the de&s;cription, that this colour tinges con|tinually the &s;ame quills. Linnaeus, in his <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> de&s;cribes the middle ones as black; and in his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> he &s;ays, with Bri&s;&s;on and Willughby, that the&s;e are white, and the lateral quills black. The&s;e naturali&s;ts &s;eem not to have examined their &s;pecimens with &s;ufficient accuracy. In the individual which I have cau&s;ed to be figured, and in others which I have viewed, I found the tail compo&s;ed of two rows of feathers, one over the other, the upper one entirely white, and the under one black, and each con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen feathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e cannot be counted exactly without plucking, as we have done, above and below the rump; it was in this way that we a&s;certained that there were fourteen white above, and as many black below.</NOTE>. Klein takes notice of a bird, which he received from Pru&s;&s;ia on the 20th of January 1747, and which was perfectly white, except the bill, the lower part of the tail, and the &s;hafts of &s;ix quills of the wings. The Lapland prie&s;t, Samuel Rheen, whom he quotes, &s;ays, that the Snow Fowl, or Ptarmigan, has not a &s;ingle black feather, except the female, which has one of that colour in each wing. And the white partridge, of which Ge&s;ner &s;peaks, was indeed entirely white, except round the ears, where
<PB N="236" REF="251">
there were &s;ome black marks; the coverts of the tail, which are white, and extending its whole length, conceal the black feathers, are what have occa&s;ioned mo&s;t of the&s;e mi&s;takes. Bri&s;&s;on reckons eighteen quills in the tail, while Wil|lughby, and &s;ome other ornithologi&s;ts, reckon only &s;ixteen; and there are really only four|teen. It would &s;eem, that the plumage of this bird, how variable &s;oever, is more uniform than the naturali&s;ts repre&s;ent it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that authors differ about the white or black colour of the lateral tail-feathers of this bird; for in &s;pread|ing out the tail with the hand, it is ea&s;y to terminate the &s;ides either by the black or the white feathers. Daubenton the younger has well remarked, that there is another method of &s;ettling the contradiction of authors, and of &s;hewing clearly that the tail con&s;i&s;ts only of fourteen quills all black, except the outer one, which is edged with white near its origin, and the tip, which is white in them all; becau&s;e the &s;hafts of the&s;e fourteen black quills are twice as thick as the &s;hafts of the four|teen white quills, and do not project &s;o far, not over-lapping entirely the &s;hafts of the black quills; &s;o that we may regard the&s;e white feathers as only coverts, though the four middle ones are as large as the black ones, which are all very nearly equal in length.</NOTE>. There are twenty|four quills in the wings, the third one, reckon|ing from the outer &s;ide, is the longe&s;t, and the fir&s;t &s;ix have black &s;hafts, though the webs are white: the down which &s;hade the feet and toes as far as the nails, is very thick and &s;oft; and it has been &s;aid, that this is a kind of fur-gloves which nature has given to the&s;e birds, to defend them from the inten&s;e cold of their native cli|mates. The nails are very long, even that of
<PB N="237" REF="252">
the little hind toe; that of the mid-toe is &s;cooped lengthwi&s;e, and its edges are &s;harp, which enables it to form holes in the &s;now with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ptarmigan is at lea&s;t as large as a tame pigeon, according to Willughby; its length is fourteen or fifteen inches, the extent of its wings twenty-two inches, and its weight four|teen ounces: ours is rather &s;maller. But Lin|naeus remarks, that they are of different &s;izes, and that the &s;malle&s;t inhabits the Alps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fauna Suecica.</BIBL></NOTE>. He &s;ubjoins, indeed, that the &s;ame bird is found in the fore&s;ts of the northern countries, and e&s;pe|cially in Lapland; which gives room to &s;u&s;pect, that this &s;pecies is different from our Alpine Ptarmigan, which has different habits, and pre|fers the lofty mountains: unle&s;s perhaps we &s;ay, that the cold which prevails on the &s;ummits of the Alps is nearly the &s;ame with what is experi|enced in the vallies and fore&s;ts of Lapland. But the di&s;agreement of writers with re&s;pect to the cry of the Ptarmigan &s;eems to prove decidedly, that there is a confu&s;ion of &s;pecies.

There is rea&s;on then for the divi&s;ion which I have drawn be|tween the Ptarmigans of the Alps, the Pyren|nees, and &s;uch other mountains, and the birds of the &s;ame genus that occur in the fore&s;ts, and even in the plains of the northern regions.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, that in winter the Ptarmigan is robed in white; in &s;ummer, it is covered with brown &s;pots, which are &s;cat|tered irregularly on a white ground. It may be &s;aid, however, never to enjoy the &s;ol&s;titial warmth, and to be determined by its &s;ingular &s;tructure to prefer the chilling fro&s;t; for as the &s;now melts on the &s;ides of the mountains, the bird con&s;tantly a&s;cends, till it gains the &s;ummits, where reigns eternal winter. It would &s;eem to be oppre&s;&s;ed by the dazzle of the &s;olar rays; it withdraws from the lu&s;tre of day, and forms holes and burrows under the &s;now.

<P>THE authors of the Briti&s;h Zoology ju&s;tly blame Bri&s;&s;on for cla&s;&s;ing the Ptarmigan with Edwards's White Partridge, &s;ince they are di&s;tinct &s;pecies; for the latter is thrice as large as the Ptarmigan, and the colours of their &s;um|mer garb are al&s;o very different, the White Par|tridge having broad &s;pots of white and deep orange, and the Ptarmigan &s;treaks of a du&s;ky brown on a light brown. The &s;ame authors admit, that in winter both birds are alike, al|mo&s;t entirely white. Edwards &s;ays, that the lateral quills of the tail are black even in winter, and only tipt with white; and yet he afterwards &s;ubjoins, that one of the&s;e which had been killed in that &s;ea&s;on, and brought from Hud&s;on's-bay by Light, was of a &s;nowy white, which &s;till more &s;hews that in this &s;pecies the colours of the plumage are variable.</P>
<P>The White Grous is of a middle &s;ize, between the partridge and the phea&s;ant, and its &s;hape would re&s;emble that of the former, if its tail
<PB N="243" REF="258">
were &s;omewhat &s;horter. The one repre&s;ented in Edwards, Pl. LXXII. is a cock, &s;uch as it is in &s;pring, when it begins to drop its winter's robe, and feel the influence of the &s;ea&s;on of love; its eyebrows are red and more prominent, and in &s;hort, like tho&s;e of the Red Grous; it has al&s;o &s;mall white feathers round the eyes, and others at the bottom of the bill, which cover the no&s;trils; the two middle feathers are variegated like tho&s;e of the neck, the two &s;ucceeding are white, and all the re&s;t blacki&s;h, tipt with white, both in &s;um|mer and winter.</P>
<P>The livery of &s;ummer extends only over the upper part of the body; the belly continues al|ways white, the feet and toes are entirely cover|ed with feathers, or rather with white hairs; the nails are le&s;s curved than u&s;ual in birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have &s;een two birds brought from Siberia under the name of <HI>Ptarmigans,</HI> which were probably the &s;ame &s;pecies with that of Hud&s;on's Bay, and who&s;e nails were &s;o flat, that they re&s;emble more the nails of Apes than the claws of birds.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The White Grous re&s;ides the whole year in Hud&s;on's-bay; it pa&s;&s;es the night in holes that it makes in the &s;now, which, in the&s;e arctic countries, re&s;embles fine &s;and. In the morning it emerges from its retreat, and flies directly up|wards, &s;haking the &s;now from off its wings. It feeds in the morning and evening, and does not &s;eem to dread the &s;un, like the Ptarmigan of the Alps; &s;ince it &s;pends whole days expo&s;ed to his rays, even in the middle of the day, when they

are mo&s;t forcible. Edwards received this &s;ame bird from Norway, which appears to me to form the &s;hade between the Ptarmigan and the Red Grous; having the feet of the one, and the large eyebrows of the other. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the White Grous, <HI>Tetrao-Albus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It is orange, variegated with black &s;tripes and white da&s;hes; its toes &s;haggy; its tail-quills black, and white at the tip; the in|termediate ones entirely white.</Q> The White Grous are amazingly numerous about Hud&s;on's Bay; where they breed all along the coa&s;t, and lay about ten eggs, &s;prinkled with black.

They are e&s;teemed excellent meat, and much &s;ought for by the &s;ervants of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company.

<P>IT would &s;eem that the Hazel Grous of Canada, and the Hazel Grous of Hud&s;on's Bay, as de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on and de&s;igned by Edwards, are the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It is frequent through the whole year in the country bordering on Hud&s;on's Bay, and prefers the plains and low grounds; whereas, in another climate, the &s;ame bird, &s;ays Ellis, is found in the highe&s;t tracts, and even on the &s;ummit of moun|tains. In Canada, it is called the Partridge.</P>
<P>The male is &s;maller than the common Hazel Grous; its eyebrows red; its no&s;trils covered with &s;mall black feathers; the wings &s;hort; the feet clothed below the tar&s;us; the toes and nails gray; the bill black. In general its colour is very du&s;ky, and is brightened only by a few white

<P>The female is &s;maller than the male, and the colours of its plumage lighter and more varie|gated; in other re&s;pects it is preci&s;ely alike.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds feed on pine cones, juniper-berries, &amp;c. They are numerous in the northern coun|tries of America, and are &s;tored up for winter's provi&s;ions; the fro&s;t pre&s;erves them from prutre|faction, and they are thawed in cold water, when they are to be u&s;ed. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Tetrao Canaden&s;is:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its tail-quills are black, fulvous at the tip; two white da&s;hes at the eyes.</Q> By the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers at Hud&s;on's Bay it is called the <HI>Wood Par|tridge,</HI> becau&s;e it u&s;ually lives among the pines.

<P>Though Bri&s;&s;on conceives this bird al&s;o as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the ruffed Hazel Grous of Penn&s;ylvania, it is highly probable that they are
<PB N="247" REF="262">
really the &s;ame: and to this &s;pecies mu&s;t we re|fer too the ruffed Heath-cock of Edwards. If we con&s;ider that Edwards's figure was taken from a living bird in love-&s;ea&s;on, and that Bri&s;&s;on's was copied from a dead &s;ubject; if we make allow|ance for the liberties which are &s;ugge&s;ted by the fancy of the de&s;igner, we may di&s;regard the minute di&s;parities.</P>
<P>It is rather larger than the ordinary Hazel Grous, and like it, the wings are &s;hort, and the feathers that cover the feet reach not to the toes; but it has neither the red eyebrows, nor the ring of that colour which encircles the eyes. What di&s;tingui&s;h it, are the two tufts of feathers which ri&s;e from the upper part of the brea&s;t, one on each &s;ide, and project beyond the re&s;t, and bend downwards; the feathers which form the&s;e are of a fine black, the edges beaming with different reflections of gold green. The bird can expand at plea&s;ure the&s;e fal&s;e wings, which when clo&s;ed fall on both &s;ides on the upper part of the true; the bill, toes, and nails, are of a reddi&s;h brown.</P>
<P>This bird is, according to Edwards, very com|mon in Maryland and Penn&s;ylvania, where it is called the <HI>phea&s;ant.</HI> But its in&s;tincts and habits are much nearer tho&s;e of the Grous. It is of a middle &s;ize between that of the phea&s;ant and the partridge; its feet are feathered, and its toes in|dented on the edges like tho&s;e of the Grous; its bill is &s;imilar to that of a common cock; its
<PB N="248" REF="263">
no&s;trils are &s;haded with &s;mall feathers, which ri&s;e from the bottom of the bill, and point for|ward; the whole upper part of the body, in|cluding the head, the tail, and the wings, are mailed with different brown colours, more or le&s;s brightened with the mixture of orange and black; the throat is of a brilliant orange, though rather deep; the &s;tomach, the belly and the thighs, are marked with black &s;pots, in the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent, and &s;trewed with regularity on a white ground; it is furni&s;hed with long feathers round the head and neck, which it can erect at will, and form a cre&s;t or ruff, and this it gene|rally does in the &s;ea&s;on of its amours; it al&s;o &s;preads the tail-quills like a fan, inflates its craw, trails its wings, and ru&s;tles with a whirring noi&s;e like a turkey-cock; it &s;ummons its females al&s;o by a very odd &s;ort of clapping the wings, which is &s;o loud as to be heard at half-a-mile's di&s;tance in calm weather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bartram &s;ays, that the people of Penn&s;ylvania call this the <HI>thumping</HI> of the ruffed Grous.</NOTE>. It takes this kind of exer|ci&s;e in &s;pring and autumn, which are the &s;ea&s;ons of breeding, and repeats it every day at &s;tated hours, viz. at nine o'clock in the morning, and four o'clock in the afternoon, and this always &s;itting on a dead trunk. At fir&s;t, it &s;trikes &s;low|ly, allowing an interval of two &s;econds between each beat; but it gradually quickens the &s;trokes, which at la&s;t become &s;o rapid as to appear a
<PB N="249" REF="264">
continued &s;ound, re&s;embling the noi&s;e of a drum, or, according to &s;ome, the muttering of di&s;tant thunder. This noi&s;e la&s;ts about a minute, and, after a repo&s;e of &s;even or eight minutes, it again renews and pa&s;&s;es through the &s;ame gradations. Such is the call which invites the female to the fea&s;t of love; but what an|nounces a future generation, is often the &s;ignal for the de&s;truction of the pre&s;ent. The &s;port&s;|man, led by the noi&s;e, approaches the bird unper|ceived, and when the male is di&s;&s;olved in con|vul&s;ions of plea&s;ure, he takes the fatal aim. If the bird however ob&s;erve the per&s;on, it &s;tops its motions, and flies off three or four hundred paces.&mdash;The&s;e are really the in&s;tincts and habits of the European Grous, though the &s;ingularities are rather heightened.</P>
<P>The common food of tho&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania is grain, fruits, wild grapes, and above all ivy berries, which is the more extraordinary, as the&s;e prove fatal to other animals.</P>
<P>They hatch only twice a year, probably in &s;pring and autumn, which are the two &s;ea&s;ons when the male beats his wings. They make their ne&s;ts on the ground with leaves, or by the &s;ide of a fallen trunk, or at the foot of a tree; all which habits indicate a heavy bird. They lay from twelve to &s;ixteen eggs, and &s;it about three weeks. The mother has the &s;afety of her young much at heart; &s;he ri&s;ks every thing in their defence, and expo&s;es her&s;elf to all the
<PB N="250" REF="265">
dangers that menace their de&s;truction. The tender brood are them&s;elves dexterous in &s;earch|ing for a concealment beneath the leaves. But all the&s;e precautions are in&s;ufficient to elude the dreaded a&s;&s;aults of the birds of prey. The little family continues united, till the glow of the fol|lowing &s;pring in&s;pires new appetites, and di&s;|per&s;es its members.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are exceedingly wild, and can never be tamed. If they are hatched under common hens, they fly almo&s;t as &s;oon as they bur&s;t from the &s;hell, and hide them&s;elves in the fore&s;ts. The fle&s;h is white, and an excel|lent meat; and may not this be the rea&s;on why the rapacious birds cha&s;e them with &s;uch per&s;everance? We have already mentioned the conjecture in treating of the European Grous; if it were confirmed by a &s;ufficient num|ber of ob&s;ervations, we might infer that vora|city does not always exclude predilection, but that the birds of prey have nearly the &s;ame ta&s;te as man: and this would afford another analogy between tho&s;e two &s;pecies. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Ruffed Grous, <HI>Tetrao-Umbellus:</HI> <Q REND="inline">It has a ruff about its neck.</Q> Its fle&s;h is lean, dry, clo&s;e, and exceedingly white; yet if well cooked, it is excellent food.

The individual repre&s;ented in Edwards, Plate CXVII, is a female, with the &s;ize, colour, and long tail of the phea&s;ant; the plumage of the male is of a deeper &s;hining brown, with various reflections near the neck: and he &s;tands very erect, with a bold a&s;pect; differences which are invariable between the male and female in all birds of this kind.

<P>IF empire belonged to beauty and not to &s;trength, the Peacock would undoubtedly be king of the birds; for upon none of them has Nature poured her trea&s;ures with &s;uch profu&s;ion. Dignity of appearance, noblene&s;s of demeanour, elegance of form, &s;weetne&s;s and delicacy of pro|portions, whatever marks di&s;tinction and com|mands re&s;pect, have been be&s;towed. A light waving tuft, painted with the riche&s;t colours, adorns its head, and rai&s;es without oppre&s;&s;ing it. Its matchle&s;s plumage &s;eems to combine all that delights the eye in the &s;oft delicate tints of the fine&s;t flowers; all that dazzles it in the &s;parkling lu&s;tre of the gems; and all that a&s;to|ni&s;hes it in the grand di&s;play of the rainbow. But not only has Nature united, in the plumage
<PB N="254" REF="270">
of the Peacock, to form a ma&s;ter-piece of mag|nificence, all the colours of heaven and earth; &s;he has &s;elected, mingled, &s;haded, melted them with her inimitable pencil, and formed an un|rivalled picture, where they derive from their mixture and their contra&s;t new brilliancy, and effects of light &s;o &s;ublime, that our art can nei|ther imitate nor de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>Such appears the plumage of the Peacock, when at ea&s;e he &s;aunters alone in a fine vernal day. But if a female is pre&s;ented &s;uddenly to his view; if the fires of love, joined to the &s;ecret influence of the &s;ea&s;on, rou&s;e him from his tranquillity, and in&s;pire him with new ardour and new de&s;ires; his beauties open and expand, his eyes become animated and expre&s;|&s;ive, his tuft flutters on his head, and expre&s;&s;es the warmth that &s;tirs within; the long feathers of the tail, ri&s;ing, di&s;play their dazzling rich|ne&s;s; the head and neck bending nobly back|wards, trace their &s;hadow gracefully on that &s;hining ground, where the &s;un-beams play in a thou&s;and ways, continually extingui&s;hed and renewed, and &s;eem to lend new lu&s;tre, more delicious and more enchanting; new colours, more variegated and more harmonious; each movement of the bird produces new &s;hades, numberle&s;s clu&s;ters of waving, fugitive reflec|tions, which ever vary and ever plea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is then that the Peacock &s;eems to &s;pread out all his beauties, only to delight his female, who,

though denied the rich attire, is captivated with its di&s;play; the liveline&s;s which the ardor of love mingles with his ge&s;tures, adds new grace to his movements, which are naturally noble and dignified, and which, at this time, are ac|companied with a &s;trong hollow murmur ex|pre&s;&s;ive of de&s;ire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Running forward with a creeking noi&s;e.</Q> <BIBL>PALLADIUS.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

before the clo&s;e of his reign, they were become common; for we learn from the

<P>The pea-hens are al&s;o of an amorous mould, and when deprived of the males, they toy with each other, and welter in the du&s;t; but the eggs which they lay are then void of the principle of life.

agree that the age of three years is the term when the Pea|cock has acquired
his full growth, and is fit to perform the office of the male; and that the

<P>The female lays her eggs &s;oon after fecunda|tion; &s;he does not exclude one every day, but only once in three or four days, and according to Ari&s;totle &s;he has but one hatch in the year, which con&s;i&s;ts in the fir&s;t of eight eggs, and in the following years of twelve. But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of tho&s;e pea-hens that both lay their eggs and rear their young; for if the eggs be re|moved as fa&s;t as they are laid, and are placed under a common hen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle &s;ays, that an ordinary hen cannot hatch more than two pea-hens' eggs; but Columella allows five of the&s;e eggs in addition to four common eggs. He advi&s;es to remove the eggs the tenth day, and &s;ub&s;titute an equal number of the &s;ame kind recently laid, in order that they may be hatched along with the pea-hen's eggs, which require ten days longer incubation. La&s;tly, he directs that the&s;e be turned every day, if the &s;itter be un|able to do it on account of their bulk, which it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover by marking the eggs on one &s;ide.</NOTE>, they will, according to Columella, have three hatches in the cour&s;e of the year; the fir&s;t of five eggs, the &s;econd of four, and the third of two or three. It would &s;eem that in this country they are not &s;o prolific, &s;ince they lay &s;carcely four or five eggs in the year. On the other hand, they appear to be far more prolific in India, where, according to Peter Mar|tyr, they lay twenty or thirty, as I have already noticed. The temperature of a climate has a mighty influence on whatever relates to genera|tion,
<PB N="267" REF="283">
and this is the key to tho&s;e apparent con|tradictions which are found between the writings of the ancients and our own ob&s;ervations. In a warm country, the males are more ardent, fight with each other, require more females, and the&s;e lay a greater number of eggs; but in a cold country the latter are not &s;o prolific, and the former are calm and indifferent.</P>
<P>If the pea-hen be &s;uffered to follow the bent of in&s;tinct, &s;he will lay her eggs in a &s;ecret re|tired &s;pot; the eggs are white, and &s;peckled like tho&s;e of the turkey-hen, and nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize. It is a&s;&s;erted that &s;he is very apt to lay in the night, or rather carele&s;sly drop the eggs from the roo&s;t on which &s;he is perched; and for this rea&s;on, it is advi&s;ed to &s;pread &s;traw under|neath, to prevent their being broken by the fall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Columella, lib. viii. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the whole time of incubation, the pea-hen anxiou&s;ly &s;huns the male, and is par|ticularly careful to conceal her track, when &s;he returns from the ne&s;t: for in this &s;pecies, as in the gallinaceous tribe and many others<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;totle Hi&s;t.

If he di&s;covers his mate &s;itting on her eggs, he breaks them; probably to re|move an ob&s;tacle to the gratification of his pa&s;|&s;ions.

Some have imagined that it was from the de&s;ire of covering them him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, which would be a very different motive.

<P>It is &s;aid that the pea-hen never hatches all her eggs at once, but as &s;oon as a few chickens emerge, &s;he leaves the ne&s;t to lead them about.

<P>As the young Peacocks grow &s;trong, they begin to fight, (e&s;pecially in warm countries,) and for this rea&s;on the ancients, who &s;eem to have be&s;towed more attention than we in training the&s;e birds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Id. ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, kept them in &s;mall &s;eparate huts<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varro, <HI>De Re Ru&s;tica,</HI> lib. iii. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>.

Such a &s;pot indeed allowed them to follow freely the bent of nature, without danger of e&s;caping, &s;ince they are unable to fly to a di&s;tance, and cannot &s;wim; and at the &s;ame time they had nothing to apprehend from ra|pacious animals, which were entirely extirpated from the little i&s;land. They lived there at ea&s;e, without con&s;taint, and without di&s;quietude; they thrived better, and (what was not over|looked by the Romans) their fle&s;h acquired a finer reli&s;h; and to have them under their eye, and to examine whether their numbers increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, they accu&s;tomed them every day at a &s;tated hour, on the di&s;play of a certain &s;ignal,
<PB N="272" REF="288">

<P>When the brood are a month old, or a little more, the cre&s;t begins to &s;hoot, and then they are &s;ubject to &s;ickne&s;s, as the young turkies in &s;imilar circum&s;tances. At this time the parent cock adopts them as his offspring; for before the growth of the cre&s;t, he drives them away as &s;up|po&s;ititious<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Palladius, <HI>De Re Ru&s;tica,</HI> lib. i. 28.</BIBL></NOTE>. They ought not however to be tru&s;ted with the old ones before the age of &s;even months, and they mu&s;t be accu&s;tomed to perch on the roo&s;t, that they may not &s;uffer from lying on the ground, on account of the cold damps<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Columella.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The cre&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall feathers, of which the &s;haft is not furni&s;hed with webs, but be&s;et with little &s;lender detached threads; the top is formed by a bunch of ordinary feathers united together, and painted with the riche&s;t colours.</P>
<P>The number of the&s;e &s;mall feathers is variable; I have counted twenty-five in a male, and thirty in a female; but I have not examined enough to decide accurately.</P>
<P>The cre&s;t is not an inverted cone, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed; its ba&s;e, which is uppermo&s;t, forms a very exten&s;ive ellip&s;e, who&s;e greater axis is in the direction of the head; all the feathers that compo&s;e it, have a particular and perceptible
<PB N="273" REF="289">
motion, by which they approach each other, or recede, at will, and al&s;o a general motion, by which the whole cre&s;t is &s;ometimes erected, &s;ometimes reclined.</P>
<P>The waving &s;ummits of this cre&s;t, as well as all the re&s;t of the plumage, are decorated with much more &s;plendid colours in the male than in the female. Be&s;ides this circum&s;tance, the cock is di&s;criminated from the hen when three months old, by a little yellow which appears on the tip of the wing; he is afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;ize, by the &s;pur on each leg, by the length of his tail, and the power of expanding it like a fan. Willughby fancies that the Peacock &s;hares that remarkable property with the turkey alone; but in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory we have &s;een that it belongs al&s;o to &s;ome grous, to &s;ome pigeons, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The tail-feathers, or rather tho&s;e long coverts that are in&s;erted in the back near the rump, are on a great &s;cale what tho&s;e of the cre&s;t are on a &s;mall one. The &s;haft is equally furni&s;hed from its origin to its extremity, with parted filaments of a varying colour, and it ends in a flat vane, decorated with what is called the <HI>eye,</HI> or the <HI>mir|ror.</HI> This is a brilliant &s;pot, enamelled with the mo&s;t enchanting colours; yellow, gilded with many &s;hades, green running into blue and bright violet, according to the different po&s;itions, and the whole receives additional lu&s;tre from the colour of the centre, which is a fine velvet black.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="290">
The two feathers in the middle are each four feet and a half long, and extend beyond the re&s;t, the others gradually dimini&s;hing as they ap|proach the &s;ides. The cre&s;t is permanent, but the tail is ca&s;t every year, either entirely or in part, about the end of July, and &s;hoots again in the &s;pring; during which interval the bird is di&s;pirited and &s;eeks retirement.</P>
<P>The predominant colour of the head, throat, neck, and brea&s;t is blue, with different reflections of violet, yellow, and lucid green; and by means of the&s;e waving &s;hades, nature can &s;pread a greater variety of colouring on the &s;ame &s;pace.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the head, there is a protube|rance formed by &s;mall feathers, which cover the perforation of the external ear.</P>
<P>Peacocks &s;eem to toy with each other by the bill; but on examining them clo&s;ely, I find that they &s;cratch the head, which is &s;ubject to a very nimble &s;ort of lice. The&s;e may be &s;een running over the white &s;kin that encircles the eyes, which mu&s;t occa&s;ion an unea&s;y feeling. Accordingly, the birds remain very tame and &s;eem plea&s;ed when another &s;cratches them.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds a&s;&s;ume the rule in the yard, and will not &s;uffer the other poultry to feed till they have &s;atisfied their hunger. They eat nearly the &s;ame way with the gallinaceous tribe, laying hold of the grain by the point of the bill, and &s;wallowing it whole.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="291">
When they drink, they plunge their bill into the water, and make five or &s;ix quick motions with the lower jaw; then rai&s;ing their head and holding it horizontal, they &s;wallow the water, with which their mouth is filled, and without moving the bill.</P>
<P>Their food is received into the <HI>oe&s;ophagus,</HI> where a little above the anterior orifice of the &s;tomach, is placed a glandulous &s;welling filled with &s;mall tubes, which pour out much limpid liquor.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach is clothed on the out&s;ide with a great number of mu&s;cular fibres.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e birds, which was di&s;&s;ected by Ga&s;par Bartholin, there were two biliary ducts; but he found only one pancreatic duct, though there are generally two in the feathered tribes.</P>
<P>The <HI>coecum</HI> was double, and pointing from be|hind forwards; its length was equal to that of all the other inte&s;tines together, and was more capa|cious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acta Hafnien&s;ia, 1673.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rump is very thick, becau&s;e in it are in&s;erted all the mu&s;cles de&s;tined to elevate and expand the tail.</P>
<P>The excrements are commonly figured, and mixed with a little of that white matter which is common to the gallinaceous tribes, and many other birds.</P>
<P>I am informed that they &s;leep, &s;ometimes hid|ing their head under their wing, &s;ometimes co|vering their neck, and leaving the bill expo&s;ed.</P>

and even our vices, when we &s;uppo&s;e that their cry is only a groan extorted by their va|nity, as often as they view the clum&s;ine&s;s of their feet.</P>
<P>Theophra&s;tus maintains, that their cries if often reiterated, forebode rain; others, that they foretell it when they &s;cramble higher than ordi|nary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Natur&acirc; Rerum.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>Be&s;ides the different cries which I have men|tioned, the male and female emit a certain dull &s;ound, or &s;mothered cracking, which &s;eems to be formed internally, and which they often repeat, whether they are di&s;turbed or in a &s;tate of tran|quillity and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Pliny &s;ays, that a &s;ympathy has been ob&s;erved between the pigeons and the Peacocks<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. Hi&s;t.

But a more natural and better founded friend&s;hip is ob&s;erved between the turkey and Peacock. The&s;e two birds are of the number that rai&s;e and di&s;play their tail; a circum&s;tance which implies many common pro|perties.
<PB N="278" REF="294">
Accordingly, they agree better than with the other fowls. It is even &s;aid that a Peacock has been &s;een to copulate with a turkey-hen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; which would &s;hew a great analogy between the two &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The term of the life of the Peacock is twenty|five years, according to the ancients<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;totle, Hi&s;t. Anim. vi. 9.</BIBL>&mdash;<BIBL>Pliny, x. 20.</BIBL></NOTE>; and this determination &s;eems to be well-founded, &s;ince the bird is full grown before the end of three years, and the feathered race attain to a greater age than quadrupeds, becau&s;e their bones are more pliant. But I am &s;urpri&s;ed that Willugh|by imagines, on the authority of Aelian, that the Peacock lived a complete century, e&s;pecially as the account of that relator is mingled with many circum&s;tances evidently fabulous<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aelian de Nat. Anim. xi. 33.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that the Peacock feeds on all &s;orts of grain, like the gallinaceous tribe. The ancients generally gave it a monthly allowance of a bu&s;hel of wheat, weighing about twenty pounds. It is proper to notice that the flower of the elder is hurtful to them<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>, and that the leaf of the nettle is, according to Franzius, a mortal poi&s;on to the young Peacocks.</P>
<P>As in India the Peacocks live in the &s;tate of nature, it is u&s;ual in that country to hunt them. They can hardly be approached in the day-time, though they are &s;cattered over the
<PB N="279" REF="295">
fields in numerous flocks; becau&s;e, as &s;oon as they de&s;cry a &s;port&s;man, they fly away more &s;peedily than partridges, and conceal them&s;elves in the thickets, where they cannot be pur&s;ued. The night therefore is the only proper time for the cha&s;e, which, in the vicinity of Cambaya is conducted in the following manner:</P>
<P>The &s;port&s;men get clo&s;e to the tree where the Peacocks are perched, and pre&s;ent a kind of banner, which &s;upports two burning candles, and is painted with the figures of Peacocks. The Peacock dazzled by the glare, or engaged in ad|miring the painting, &s;tretches out its neck re|peatedly, and again draws it back, and when its head is ob&s;erved to be entangled in a running knot, placed for the purpo&s;e, the hunters immediately draw the cord and &s;ecure the bird<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tavernier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that the Greeks much admired the Peacock, but this was only for the beauty of the plumage. The Romans, who carried every luxury to exce&s;s, actually fea&s;ted on Pea|cocks fle&s;h. The orator Horten&s;ius was the fir&s;t who ordered it to be &s;erved up at his table<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varro, <HI>De Re Ru&s;tica,</HI> lib. iii. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>, and his example being followed, this bird came to be &s;old at a very high price at Rome. The Emperors refined on the luxury of their &s;ub|jects; and Vitellius and Heliogabalus gloried in filling enormous chargers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Among others that called by Vitellius the Aegis of Minerva.</NOTE> with the brains of

Peacocks, the tongues of the <HI>phoenicopterus,</HI> and the livers of the <HI>&s;carus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suetonius.</NOTE>, forming in&s;ipid di&s;hes, who&s;e whole merit con&s;i&s;ted in their de|&s;tructive expence.&mdash;In tho&s;e times, a flock of an hundred Peacocks could bring a revenue of 60,000 &s;e&s;terces, three Peacocks being only re|quired of the keeper for each hatch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varro, <HI>De Re Ru&s;tic&acirc;,</HI> lib. iii. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>. This &s;um, according to the e&s;timation of Ga&s;&s;endi, amounts to 10 or 12,000 livres. Among the Greeks, the cock and hen together co&s;t a thou&s;and <HI>drachmae,</HI> which corre&s;ponds to eighty-&s;even livres ten &s;ous on the highe&s;t valuation, twenty|four livres on the lowe&s;t.

<P>Linnaeus affirms in general, as I have before &s;aid, that Peacocks are aver&s;e to re&s;ide in Swe|den, and he excepts not even the white &s;ort.</P>
<P>It required a long period of time, and a &s;in|gular concurrence of circum&s;tances, to reconcile a bird, bred in the delicious climates of A&s;ia and India, to the rigours of the northern tracts.

Phea&s;ants in Ireland<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Linnaeus
takes no notice of them in the enumeration he has given of the Swedi&s;h birds.
In the time of Schwenckfeld, they were very rare in Sile&s;ia; and it is only

and pro|hibited their being caught or killed. Ge&s;ner, who travelled through

indeed, that Stumpfius a&s;&s;erts the contrary; but it is probable that they
may be found in &s;ome di&s;tricts which Ge&s;ner had not examined, as in that
part which borders on the Milane&s;e terri|tories, where Olina &s;ays they are
very common. <PB N="289" REF="306"> Phea&s;ants are far from being plentiful in
France. In the northern provinces they are &s;eldom &s;een, and would perhaps
&s;oon die away but for the attention be&s;towed on the pre&s;ervation of the
royal game. Even in Brie, where &s;ome are continually making their e&s;cape
from their keepers, and where their ne&s;ts, with eggs, have been found in the
exten&s;ive fore&s;ts of that pro|vince, &s;o unfavourable is the climate that
the number of the wild Phea&s;ants is never ob&s;erved to increa&s;e. We knew
an opulent per&s;on in Burgundy, who was at the utmo&s;t pains and &s;pared no
expence in &s;tocking his e&s;tate, which lay in Auxois, but without
&s;ucce&s;s. I &s;hould therefore &s;u&s;pect that Regnard mu&s;t have been
mi&s;taken when he tells us, that he killed two Phea&s;ants in Bothnia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Regnard, <HI>Voyage de Lapponie.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; and Olaus
Magnus, who &s;ays that they are found in Scan|dinavia, where they lie under

to the grous than to the Phea&s;ants; and the name <HI>Gallae
&s;ylve&s;tres,</HI> which Olaus applies, &s;uits better that genus of birds.
My conjecture has the more foundation, &s;ince neither Linnaeus, nor any other
accurate ob&s;erver, mentions &s;eeing real Phea&s;ants in the northern
countries. In &s;hort, we may &s;uppo&s;e, that the name Phea&s;ant has fir&s;t
been given by <PB N="290" REF="307"> the natives to the grous, which are very
nu|merous in the boreal tracts, and afterwards adopted blindly by travellers,
and even by compilers, who are equally inattentive in di&s;cri|minating
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>Since the wings of the Phea&s;ant are &s;hort, con&s;equently its flight low and laborious, we may readily conclude, that it could not traver&s;e the immen&s;e ocean that divides America from the temperate countries in the Ancient Conti|nent. Accordingly, none have been found in the New World, but only &s;ome birds a-kin to them. I &s;peak not of the true Phea&s;ants which are at pre&s;ent common in the plantations of St. Do|mingo; for the&s;e, as well as the peacocks and pintados, were introduced by the Europeans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;toire de l'I&s;le E&s;pagnole de St. Domingue.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Phea&s;ant is of the &s;ize of the common cock<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus, who has carefully ob&s;erved and de&s;cribed this bird, &s;ays, that he examined one which weighed three pounds of twelve ounces, <HI>libras tres duodecim unciarum,</HI> which &s;ome have ig|norantly tran&s;lated, three pounds twelve ounces.</NOTE>, and in &s;ome re&s;pects rivals the peacock in beauty. His figure is as dignified, his de|portment as bold, and his plumage almo&s;t as re&s;plendent. The colours of the Chine&s;e Phea|&s;ant are even brighter; but he has not, like the peacock, the power of di&s;playing his rich plumage, and of elevating the long feathers of his tail. Be&s;ides, the Phea&s;ant has neither the cre&s;t of the peacock, nor the double tail; of

<P>Palladius alleges, that the cocks need only be a year old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Journal Economique, Sept. 1753.</BIBL></NOTE>, and all naturali&s;ts agree, that hens are proper for breeding the third year. Some|times when Phea&s;ants are numerous, it is &s;uf|ficient to lodge the females in the inclo&s;ures, and leave them to the embraces of the wild cocks.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds feed on all &s;orts of grain and herbs. It is even recommended to throw part of the park into a kitchen garden, in which to rai&s;e beans, carrots, potatoes, onions, lettuces, par|&s;nips, and e&s;pecially the two la&s;t, of which they are remarkably fond. It is al&s;o &s;aid that they love acorns, the berries of the white thorn, and &s;eed of wormwood<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gerbillon, <HI>Voyage de la Chine &amp; de la Tartarie.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; but the food be&s;t adapted to them is wheat mixed with ants eggs. Some advi&s;e not to mix ants them&s;elves, le&s;t they take a di&s;like to the eggs; but Edmond King recom|mends the ants them&s;elves, and affirms that the&s;e in&s;ects afford them the mo&s;t &s;alutary nouri&s;hment, and can even re&s;tore them when they are &s;ickly and drooping; and that in&s;tead of the&s;e, we may &s;ub&s;titute even gra&s;hoppers, ear-wigs, and millepedes. The Engli&s;h author, whom I have ju&s;t quoted, a&s;&s;ures us, that he lo&s;t many Phea|&s;ants

before he learnt this fact, but that after he attended to that circum&s;tance, not one died of tho&s;e which he was breeding<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. But whatever &s;ort of food we give them, it mu&s;t be offered &s;paringly, not to make them too fat; for corpu|lence blunts the ardor of the cock, weakens the prolific powers of the hen, and makes her lay eggs with &s;oft &s;hells and ea&s;ily broken.</P>
<P>The time of incubation is from twenty to twenty-five days, according to mo&s;t authors and my own ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, Schwenckfeld.&mdash;<BIBL>Journal Economique</BIBL>, &amp; le Roi.</NOTE>.

<P>We ought to keep the &s;itting-hen in a place remote from noi&s;e and &s;omewhat under ground, &s;o as not to be affected by the variations of the weather, or expo&s;ed to the &s;troke of thunder.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the young Phea&s;ants leave the &s;hell, they begin to run like all the gallinaceous tribe. For the fir&s;t twenty-four hours, food is generally withheld from them; after that, they are put with the mother into a crib, and carried out every day to the fields, into the pa&s;ture grounds where ant-hills abounds. This ought
<PB N="299" REF="316">
to be covered with deals, which may be re|moved or replaced as occa&s;ion requires. It ought al&s;o to have a divi&s;ion near one of the ends, where the mother &s;hould be confined with bars &s;o wide a&s;under however as to allow the chickens to go out and return as often as they chu&s;e. The clucking of the impri&s;oned mother, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being frequently warmed, will con&s;tantly bring them back and prevent them from &s;auntering too far. It is u&s;ual to join to|gether three or four hatches of nearly the &s;ame age, &s;o as to form a &s;ingle family, which may be reared by the &s;ame mother.</P>
<P>They are fed at fir&s;t, like all young chicks, with a mixture of hard eggs, crumbs of bread, and lettuce leaves mixed together, and with an addition of the eggs of meadow ants. But at this tender age two precautions mu&s;t be carefully ob&s;erved. They mu&s;t not be allowed to drink at all, nor be carried abroad till the dew is entirely gone, for humidity of every kind is hurtful to them. We may notice by the way, that this is one of the rea&s;ons why hatches of wild Phea&s;ants &s;eldom &s;ucceed in France; for, as I have already remarked, the&s;e birds prefer the fre&s;h verdant places, and in &s;uch &s;ituations the young can hardly &s;urvive the damps. The &s;econd point to be attended to is, that their food &s;hould be given frequently and in &s;mall quantities, beginning as &s;oon as day break, and always mixing with it ants eggs.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="317">
In the &s;econd month, more &s;ub&s;tantial nouri&s;hment may be given; eggs of the wood ants, turkey beans, wheat, barley, millet, ground beans; and the intervals between the meals may be gradually enlarged.</P>
<P>At this time they begin to be &s;ubject to ver|min. To prevent that di&s;order, mo&s;t modern writers advi&s;e us to clean the crib, or even to lay it a&s;ide altogether, except the &s;mall roof which &s;erves to &s;helter them. Olina recom|mends a plan propo&s;ed by Ari&s;totle, which &s;eems to me better contrived and more &s;uitable to the nature of the&s;e birds. They are in the number of tho&s;e that welter in the du&s;t, and when that gratification is withheld, they langui&s;h and die<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARIST. Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. v. 31.</BIBL></NOTE>. Olina directs &s;mall heaps of dry earth or very fine &s;and to be laid near them, in which they may tumble and rid them&s;elves of the painful itching occa&s;ioned by the in&s;ects.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o be very attentive in giving them clean water, and in often renewing it, el&s;e they will be in danger of contracting the pip, of which there is &s;carcely any remedy, according to the moderns; though Palladius advi&s;es to remove it as in common chickens, and to rub the bill with garlick brui&s;ed with tar.</P>
<P>The third month is attended with new di&s;ea&s;es. The tail feathers then drop and others appear, which is a &s;ort of cri&s;is to them, as well as to
<PB N="301" REF="318">
the Peacocks. But ants eggs are &s;till a re&s;ource; they ha&s;ten the trying moment, and le&s;&s;en the danger, provided we do not give them too much, for the exce&s;s is pernicious. In proportion as the young Phea&s;ants grow up, their regimen becomes the more like that of the adults; and at the end of the third month, they may be let loo&s;e in the place intended to be &s;tocked. But &s;uch is the effect of dome&s;tication on animals that have lived &s;ome time in that &s;tate, that even tho&s;e which, like the Phea&s;ants, have an invincible attachment to liberty, cannot be re&s;tored to it but by imperceptible degrees; in the &s;ame manner as a good &s;tomach that has been weak|ened with watery elements, cannot at once re|cover its tone, &s;o as to dige&s;t rich food. We mu&s;t fir&s;t carry the crib which contains the brood to the field where the colony is to be di&s;per&s;ed; we mu&s;t give them what food they like be&s;t, but never in the &s;ame &s;pot; and we mu&s;t dimini&s;h the quantity every day, and thus by degrees con&s;train them to provide for them&s;elves, and to become acquainted with the country. When they are able to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they &s;hould be re&s;igned to liberty and nature. They will &s;oon grow as wild as tho&s;e bred in the woods; except only that they will &s;till retain a &s;ort of affection for tho&s;e &s;pots where they were fo&s;ter|ed in their infancy.</P>

I owe this, among many other ob&s;erva|tions, to M. Le Roi, Lieutenant des Cha&s;&s;es at Ver&s;ailles.</NOTE>. A young Cock Phea&s;ant which had never copulated, was &s;hut in a clo&s;e place where but a faint light glimmered through the roof: &s;ome young pul|lets were &s;elected, who&s;e plumage re&s;embled the mo&s;t that of the Phea&s;ant, and were put in a crib adjoining that of the Cock Phea&s;ant, and &s;epa|rated from it only by a grate, of which the ribs were &s;o clo&s;e as to admit no more than the head and neck of the&s;e birds. The Cock Phea&s;ant was thus accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the&s;e females, and even to live with them, becau&s;e the food was thrown into the crib only. When they had grown familiar and the &s;ea&s;on of love ap|proached, both the cock and hens were fed on heating aliments, to provoke their de&s;ires; and after they di&s;covered an inclination to couple, the grate which parts them was removed. It &s;ome|times happened, that the Cock Phea&s;ant, faithful to nature and indignant at the in&s;ult offered him, abu&s;ed the hens, and even killed the fir&s;t he met with: but if his rage did not &s;ub&s;ide, he was on the one hand mollified by touching his bill
<PB N="303" REF="320">
with a red-hot iron, and on the other, &s;timulated by the application of proper fomentations. At la&s;t his appetites however growing every day more fiery, and nature con&s;tantly counteract|ing her&s;elf, he at la&s;t copulated with the hens, which in con&s;equence laid eggs dotted with black, like tho&s;e of the Phea&s;ant, but much larger; and they produced hybrids partaking the properties of both &s;pecies, and, according to &s;ome, more delicate, and even better flavoured than the true &s;ort, but incapable, it is &s;aid, of propagating their kind: yet Longolius a&s;&s;erts, that the females of this kind which couple with their &s;ire, produce real Phea&s;ants. Care has al&s;o been taken to give the Cock Phea&s;ant only virgin hens; whether the more to incite the males, (for man judges of all creatures from him&s;elf,) or becau&s;e the repetition of the experiment on the &s;ame &s;ubjects is &s;aid to occa&s;ion the breed to degenerate.</P>
<P>It is pretended that the Phea&s;ant is a &s;tupid bird, and imagines it&s;elf &s;afe when its head is concealed; which has been alleged of many other birds that heedle&s;sly fall into all &s;orts of &s;nares. When hunted by a pointer, and met, it &s;tands &s;till, and looks &s;teadily at the dog, &s;o that the &s;port&s;man can take his aim at lei&s;ure.

<P>A fat young Phea&s;ant is a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mor|&s;el, and at the &s;ame time very whole&s;ome food.

<P>Some authors, who have applied to this bird the name of <HI>Red Phea&s;ant,</HI> would have had equal rea&s;on to have called it the <HI>Blue Phea&s;ant,</HI> and the term <HI>Golden Phea&s;ant</HI> is equally inadequate to denote the plumage, which is enriched by the lu&s;tre of all the&s;e three colours.</P>
<P>It may be con&s;idered as a variety of the or|dinary &s;pecies, who&s;e garb &s;parkles with the de|corations of a happier clime. They are two branches of the &s;ame family, which, though long &s;eparated, recal their common de&s;cent, and can &s;till intermingle, and breed with each other. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that their progeny par|takes &s;omewhat of the &s;terility of Hybrids; which
<PB N="309" REF="327">
proves the antiquity of the partition of the pa|ternal hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Painted Phea&s;ant is &s;maller than the or|dinary Phea&s;ant. The remarkable beauty of this bird has occa&s;ioned its being &s;o much bred in our phea&s;ant walks. The predominant co|lours of its plumage are red, gold, yellow, and blue; it has long beautiful feathers on the head, which can be erected at plea&s;ure; its iris, bill, legs, and nails, are yellow; the tail is propor|tionally longer than that of the common Phea|&s;ant, more mottled, and in general of a brighter plumage; above the feathers of the tail others are &s;pread long and narrow, and of a &s;carlet co|lour, with a yellow &s;haft; the eyes are not en|circled with red &s;kin, like the European Phea&s;ant: in a word it appears to have been deeply marked by the impre&s;&s;ion of the climate.</P>
<P>The female of the Painted Phea&s;ant is &s;ome|what &s;maller than the male, and its tail is not &s;o long; the colours of its plumage are very or|dinary, and even inferior to tho&s;e of the com|mon kind; but &s;ometimes they acquire in time the beauty of the male. In England, one be|longing to Lady E&s;&s;ex changed, in the &s;pace of &s;ix years, its mean du&s;ky colour into the rich lu&s;tre of the male; &s;o as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, except by the appearance of the eyes and the length of the tail. Intelligent per&s;ons who have had opportunities of ob&s;erving the&s;e birds, in|form
<PB N="310" REF="328">
me, that this change of colour takes place in mo&s;t females, and begins at four years old, when males take a di&s;like to them and treat them har&s;hly. That then tho&s;e long narrow fea|thers, which in the male lie over the tail, begin to appear. And in a word, as they grow older, they become the more like the males, which in a certain degree happens in all animals.</P>
<P>Edwards tells us, that he &s;aw at the Duke of Leeds's, a common Hen Phea&s;ant, who&s;e plu|mage had in the &s;ame manner become like that of the male. He adds, that &s;uch changes of co|lours &s;eldom take place except among birds that live in the dome&s;tic &s;tate.</P>
<P>The eggs of the Painted Phea&s;ant are very like tho&s;e of the Pintado; they are proportion|ally &s;maller than tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic Hen, and more reddi&s;h than tho&s;e of the common Phea|&s;ant.</P>
<P>Sir Hans Sloane kept a male about fifteen years: it would therefore &s;eem that this bird is hardy, &s;ince it lived &s;o long out of its native abode. It is &s;oon reconciled to our climate, and multiplies fa&s;t; it breeds even with the European Phea&s;ant. Le Roi, Lieutenant of the Rangers at Ver&s;ailles, put one of them to a Cock Phea|&s;ant of this country, and obtained two Cock Phea&s;ants very like the common kind, but the plumage had a dirty ca&s;t, and only a few yellow feathers on the head like tho&s;e of the Painted
<PB N="311" REF="329">
Phea&s;ant: and the&s;e two young males being pair|ed with European hen-phea&s;ants, one &s;ucceeded the &s;econd year, and a hen-phea&s;ant was hatched, which could never be made to breed. The two Cocks produced no more, and the fourth year made their elopement.</P>
<P>It is probable that the Painted Phea&s;ant is that elegant phea&s;ant who&s;e plumes &s;ell higher in China than the phea&s;ant it&s;elf; and al&s;o the &s;ame with what <HI>Marco Polo</HI> admired in one of his travels to China, who&s;e tail was two or three feet long. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Painted Phea&s;ant, <HI>Pha&s;ianus Pictus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its cre&s;t is yellow, its brea&s;t &s;affron, its &s;econdary wing-quills blue, its tail wedge-&s;haped.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, from the bare in&s;pection of the figure, that it is a variety of the Phea&s;ant, having the general proportions of the Painted Chine&s;e Phea&s;ant, but larger, and exceeding even the European kind. It re&s;embles the la&s;t in a remarkable property, having a red border round the eyes, which is even broader and of greater extent; for it falls on each &s;ide below the under mandible, and at the &s;ame time ri&s;es like a double comb above the upper man|dible.</P>
<P>The female is rather &s;maller than the male, and differs much in colour. It has neither the upper-&s;ide of the body white, nor under-&s;ide of a fine black, with purple reflexions. In no part of its plumage is there any white, except a &s;ingle &s;peck below its eyes; the re&s;t is of a brown red, more or le&s;s deep, except under the belly and on the lateral feathers of the tail, where there are black tran&s;ver&s;e bars on a gray ground. In every other re&s;pect there is le&s;s difference between the &s;exes in this than in any other Phea&s;ant: the female has, like the male, a tuft on its head, its eyes are encircled with a red border, and its legs are of the &s;ame colour.</P>

<P>Edwards, to whom we are indebted for our acquaintance with this uncommon bird, ranges it among the turkies, on account of the fle&s;hy excre&s;cences on the head, and yet he has given it the name of Horned Phea&s;ant. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that it is more like the phea&s;ant than the turkey: for the&s;e protuberances are by no means peculiar to the turkey; they belong al&s;o to the cock, the pintado, the royal bird, the ca&s;&s;owary, and many others in both continents; nor are they even withheld from the phea&s;ant, &s;ince we may regard the broad circle of red &s;kin that &s;urrounds the eyes, as nearly of the &s;ame nature; and in the Pencilled Phea&s;ant of China, this really forms the double comb on the bill, and the barbils under it. If we add, that the Napaul is an inhabitant of the congenial climate of phea&s;ants, &s;ince it was &s;ent to Dr. Mead from Bengal; that in its bill, its feet, its &s;purs, its wings, and its general form, it was like the phea&s;ant; we &s;hall be convinced
<PB N="316" REF="334">
that it is more natural to cla&s;s it with the phea|&s;ants, than with an American bird &s;uch as the turkey.</P>
<P>The Napaul, or Horned Phea&s;ant, is &s;o called becau&s;e of two protuberances which grow from its head like horns, are of a blue colour, a cylin|drical &s;hape, blunt at their ends, reclined back|wards, and con&s;i&s;t of a &s;ub&s;tance re&s;embling callous fle&s;h. It has not that round circle about its eyes which occurs in the phea&s;ants, and is &s;ometimes dotted with black; the &s;pace which &s;urrounds the eyes, is &s;haded with black hairs, like feathers. Under this-&s;pace, and from the bottom of the lower mandible, grows a kind of gorget con&s;i&s;ting of loo&s;e &s;kin, which falls down and floats freely on the throat and the upper part of the neck: this gorget is black in the middle, and is &s;prinkled with a few &s;traggling hairs of the &s;ame colour. It is marked with wrinkles; &s;o that it appears to ad|mit of exten&s;ion in the living animal, and there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it can be inflated or contracted at plea&s;ure. The lateral parts are blue, with &s;ome &s;pots of orange, and without any hair on the outer &s;urface; but the in&s;ide, which applies to the neck, is &s;haded with little black feathers, as well as that part of the neck which it covers. The crown of the head is red, the fore-part of the body reddi&s;h, and the hind|part of a du&s;ky colour. Over the whole bird, including even the tail and the wings, we per|ceive

The wings &s;carcely reach beyond the origin of the tail; from which we may conclude that it is a heavy bird. The length of the tail could not be determined by Edwards, for in the original drawing it is repre&s;ented as being partly worn off. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Horned Phea&s;ant, <HI>Penelope Satyra</HI>&mdash; <Q REND="inline">It has a pair of horns on its head; its body is red, with &s;pang|ling points.</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<P>It has a &s;pike-&s;haped tuft on its head; for which rea&s;on I term it <HI>&s;picifere.</HI> This tuft is about four inches high, and appears enamelled with green and blue; the bill is of an a&s;h-colour, longer and more &s;lender than that of the Peacock; the iris is yellow, and the orbits red, as in the Phea&s;ant; the tail-feathers are fewer, their colour deeper, and their &s;pangles broader, but glowing with the &s;ame tints as in the Euro|pean Peacock. The di&s;tribution of the colours forms on the brea&s;t, the back, and that part of the wings next the back, a kind of &s;cales which give different reflexions in different places; blue on the part of the wings next the back; blue and green on the back; blue, green, and gold-colour on the brea&s;t: the other quills of the wing are green in the middle through their whole length, then yellowi&s;h, and run into black at their extremity: the crown of the head, and the arch of the neck, are covered with blue &s;pots mixed with white on a greeni&s;h ground.</P>
<P>Such is nearly the de&s;cription which Aldro|vandus has given of the male, from a painted figure &s;ent by the Emperor of Japan to the Pope. He does not inform us whether it di&s;|plays its tail like our Peacock: but it is certainly

And &s;ome naturali&s;ts, abiding by the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, have ranged it with the Phea&s;ants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein and Bri&s;&s;on.</NOTE>. But though from the con&s;idera|tion of the&s;e exterior appearances, Edwards has been induced to retain the name of Peacock-Phea&s;ant, he was convinced, on a clo&s;er in&s;pec|tion, that it did not belong to the Phea&s;ant kind: becau&s;e, 1. The long feathers of the tail are round, and not pointed at the end; 2. They are &s;traight throughout, and not arched back; 3. They do not make an inverted gutter by the bending back of their webs as in the Phea|&s;ant;
<PB N="324" REF="342">
4. It does not walk with its tail rai&s;ed and recurved as in that bird.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s does it belong to the Peacock kind, from which it differs in the carriage of its tail, in the di&s;po&s;ition and number of the quills that compo&s;e it. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed too by other pro|perties; its head and neck are thick, its tail does not ri&s;e and &s;pread like the Peacock's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards never &s;ays that this bird di&s;plays its tail: I may therefore infer the negative, &s;ince if the expan&s;ion had taken place, that intelligent naturali&s;t would have ob&s;erved it and have mentioned it.</NOTE>, and in&s;tead of a tuft, it has only a &s;ort of flat cre&s;t formed by the feathers on the top of the head, which bri&s;tle and &s;tretch towards a point &s;ome|what projecting; and la&s;tly, it has a double &s;pur on each leg, a &s;ingular character, from which I have denominated the bird<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eperonnier,</HI> from <HI>Eperon,</HI> a &s;pur.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e external differences, which undoubt|edly involve many others which are more con|cealed, would &s;eem a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to every &s;en&s;ible man, who is not prejudiced by &s;y&s;tems, for excluding it from the Peacocks and Phea|&s;ants; though like the&s;e, its toes are parted, its feet naked, its legs covered with feathers as far as the heel, the bill fa&s;hioned into a curved cone, the tail long, and the head without comb or membrane. A per&s;on who &s;ticks rigidly to a &s;y&s;tem, could not fail to range it with the Pea|cock or the Phea&s;ant, &s;ince it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the at|tributes
<PB N="325" REF="343">
of that genus; but mu&s;t the hi&s;torian, exempt from prejudice and unfettered by forms, recogni&s;e it as the Peacock of Nature?</P>
<P>In vain it will be urged, that &s;ince the prin|cipal characters of this bird are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Phea&s;ant, the little variations ought not to &s;eclude it from that arrangement; for I may &s;till a&s;k, who has a right to fix the&s;e prin|cipal characters? to decide, for in&s;tance, that the negative attribute of having neither cre&s;t nor membrane is more e&s;&s;ential than the &s;hape or the &s;ize? and to pronounce that all birds which re&s;emble each other in characters arbitrarily &s;e|lected, mu&s;t al&s;o agree in their true proper|ties?</P>
<P>In laying a&s;ide the name of Chine&s;e Peacock, I have acted conformably to the te&s;timony of travellers, who a&s;&s;ure us, that through the whole extent of that va&s;t country there are no Peacocks but &s;uch as have been introduced from abroad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Navarette, <HI>De&s;cription de la China.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this bird the iris is yellow, and al&s;o the &s;pace between the bottom of the bill and the eye; the upper mandible red; the lower mandible of a deep brown, and the feet of a dirty brown; its plumage is exceedingly beautiful; the tail, as I have already &s;aid, is &s;prinkled with oval &s;pangles, and is of a fine purple colour with reflections of blue, green, and gold. The effect of the&s;e &s;pangles, or mirrors, is the more &s;triking, as they
<PB N="326" REF="344">
are defined and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ground by a double circle, the one black and the other dull orange. Each quill of the tail has two of the&s;e mirrors clu&s;tered together, the &s;haft pa&s;&s;|ing between them. However, as the tail con|tains much fewer quills than that of the Peacock, it is much le&s;s loaded with &s;pangles; but to com|pen&s;ate this, it has a very great number on its back and wings, where the Peacock has none: tho&s;e on the wings are round; and as the ground colour of the plumage is brown, it re&s;embles a &s;able richly &s;trewed with &s;apphires, opals, eme|ralds, and topazes. The greater quills of the wing are not decorated with &s;pangles, all the re&s;t have each only one; and their colours, whether in the wings or in the tail, do not penetrate to the other &s;urface, which is of an uniform dull ca&s;t.</P>
<P>The male exceeds the &s;ize of an ordinary Phea&s;ant; and the female is a third &s;maller, and appears more lively and active. As in the male, its iris is yellow; but there is no red on its bill, and its tail is much &s;maller. And though in the female of this bird the colours are more like tho&s;e of the male, than in the Peacocks or Phea&s;ants, they are more faint and dull, and have not that lu&s;tre and tho&s;e luminous undulations which pro|duce &s;o charming an effect in the &s;pangles of the male.</P>

The Academicians had heard that their In|dian cock was brought from Africa, where it was called <HI>Ano</HI>; but as Marcgrave and &s;everal other ob&s;ervers inform us that it is a native of Brazil, and &s;ince we learn from a compari|&s;on of the mo&s;t accurate de&s;criptions and figures, that its wings are &s;hort and its flight laborious, we can hardly be per&s;uaded that it could traver&s;e the immen&s;e &s;tretch of ocean that divides the &s;hores of Africa and Brazil. It is much more natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ubjects di&s;&s;ected by the Academicians, if they were really brought from Africa, had been previou&s;ly carried thither either from Brazil or from &s;ome other &s;ettle|ment in the New World. The &s;ame rea&s;on will enable us to judge of the propriety of the appellation of the Per&s;ian Cock, be&s;towed by John&s;ton on this bird.</P>
<P>The Hocco is nearly as large as a turkey. One of its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing properties is a cre&s;t, which is black, or &s;ometimes black mixed with white, about two or three inches high, and which extends from the origin of the bill to the back of the head. The bird can rai&s;e or depre&s;s it at plea&s;ure, and according as it is differently af|fected. This cre&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of narrow tapering fea|thers &s;omewhat reclined, but the point is reflect|ed and bent forwards. Of the&s;e feathers, the Academicians ob&s;erved many who&s;e webs were inclo&s;ed half the length of their &s;haft, in a kind of membranous ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="349">
The prevailing colour of the plumage is black, which is for the mo&s;t part uniform and like vel|vet on the head and neck, and &s;ometimes &s;prinkled with white &s;peckles; the re&s;t of the body has greeni&s;h reflections, and in &s;ome &s;ub|jects it changes into a deep che&s;nut, as in that of No. 125. of the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es.</HI> The bird figured in that plate has no white under the belly or on the tail; in which re&s;pect it differs from that of No. 86. La&s;tly, Others are white below the belly and not at the tail, and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI>; and we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the&s;e co|lours are liable to vary both in their tints and in di&s;po&s;ition, according to the &s;ex.</P>
<P>The bill is &s;haped like that of the gallinaceous tribe, but is rather &s;tronger: in &s;ome, it is of a fle&s;h colour and whiti&s;h near the point, as in the Brazilian Hocco of Bri&s;&s;on: in others, the end of the upper mandible is grooved on both &s;ides, which makes it look as if it were armed with three points, the principal one in the middle, and the two lateral, formed by furrows, &s;omewhat farther back, as in the Indian Cocks of the Aca|demicians: in others, the ba&s;e is covered with a yellow &s;kin, in which are placed the no&s;trils; as in the Guiana of Bri&s;&s;on: in others, this yellow &s;kin, extending on both &s;ides of the head, forms a circle of the &s;ame colour round the eyes; as in the <HI>Mitou-poranga</HI> of Marcgrave: in others, this &s;kin &s;wells on the ba&s;e of the upper man|dible into a kind of tubercle or round bump,

&s;mall nut. It is commonly believed that the females have not this
protuberance; and Edwards adds, that it does not grow on the males till after
the fir&s;t year; which appears to be the more probable, &s;ince Fernandez
ob&s;erved in his <HI>Tepe|tototl</HI> a kind of tumor begun to form on the
bill. Some individuals, as the <HI>Mitou</HI> of Marcgrave, have a white &s;kin
behind the ear like the common hens. The legs would re&s;emble in &s;hape
tho&s;e of the gallinaceous tribe, if they had &s;purs and were not
proportionally thicker: they vary too in their colour, from a darki&s;h brown
to a car|nation.</P>
<P>Some naturali&s;ts would refer the Hocco to the genus of the turkey; but it is ea&s;y, from the foregoing de&s;cription, and from the figure, to collect numerous and deci&s;ive differences which di&s;criminate the&s;e kinds. In the turkey the head is &s;mall and not feathered, which is al&s;o the ca&s;e with the top of the neck; the bill bears a conical mu&s;cular protuberance, capable of be|ing dilated and contracted; the legs are armed with &s;purs; the tail feathers can be &s;pread like a fan, &amp;c. whereas in the Hocco, the head is large, the neck &s;unk, and both are clothed with feathers; on the bill is a round, hard, and almo&s;t bony &s;welling; and on the crown of the head a moveable cre&s;t, which &s;eems to be peculiar to this bird, and which is rai&s;ed and depre&s;&s;ed at
<PB N="332" REF="352">
plea&s;ure; but no per&s;on has ever a&s;&s;erted that it can expand its tail feathers like a fan.</P>
<P>To the&s;e exterior differences, add the more intimate e&s;&s;ential di&s;parities, which appear from di&s;&s;ection to be as numerous.</P>
<P>The inte&s;tinal canal is much longer, and the two <HI>coeca</HI> much &s;horter, than in the turkey; its craw is al&s;o much le&s;s capacious, being only four inches round; but I have &s;een a crop taken out of a turkey, that &s;eemed to have nothing unu&s;ual in its &s;tructure, that could contain half a Paris pint dry mea&s;ure. Be&s;ides, in the Hocco, the fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance of the gizzard is for the mo&s;t part very thin, and its inner coat, on the contrary, very thick, and &s;o hard as even to be apt to crack. La&s;tly, The <HI>trachea arteria</HI> dilates and makes an inflexure near where it forks; as happens in &s;ome aquatic birds, quite con|trary to what is ob&s;erved in the turkey.</P>
<P>But if the Hocco be not a turkey, the modern nomenclators had &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it a Phea&s;ant; for be&s;ides tho&s;e differences, which will readily be perceived externally and inter|nally, there is a deci&s;ive one in the in&s;tincts of the&s;e birds. The Phea&s;ant is always wild; though bred from its infancy, though treated kindly and fed with great attention, it never be|comes reconciled to the dome&s;tic &s;tate; it is ever a re&s;tle&s;s pri&s;oner, ever &s;eeking the means of e&s;cape: it even abu&s;es the companions of its &s;lavery, and never a&s;&s;ociates with them. When
<PB N="333" REF="353">
it recovers its liberty, and is re&s;tored to the &s;avage &s;tate, for which it &s;eems to be formed, nothing can be more timorous or mi&s;tru&s;tful; every new object is viewed with a &s;u&s;picious a&s;pect; the lea&s;t noi&s;e &s;cares it, and the &s;lighte&s;t motion di&s;turbs its quiet; even the &s;hadow of a branch &s;haken by the wind is &s;ufficient to make it take wing. On the contrary, the Hocco is a calm bird, &s;ecure and even &s;tupid; which perceives no danger, or at lea&s;t makes no exertion to &s;hun it: it &s;eems to forget it&s;elf, and to be carele&s;s of its own exi&s;tence. Aublet &s;hot nine of them in the &s;ame flock with the &s;ame piece, which he loaded as often as required. Such was their patient tranquillity. We may &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a bird mu&s;t be &s;ociable; that it will readily accommodate it&s;elf to the other dome&s;tic fowls; and that it can be ea&s;ily tamed. And though trained, it roams to a great di&s;tance during the day, but always returns again in the evening; as Aublet tells me him&s;elf. It becomes &s;o tame as to rub with its bill on the door to gain ad|mi&s;&s;ion; to pull the &s;ervants by the clothes when they neglect it; to follow its ma&s;ter every where; or, if not allowed, it waits anxiou&s;ly for his return, and, on &s;eeing him again, &s;hews every &s;ign of joy and affection.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive habits more oppo&s;ite; and I &s;hould imagine that no naturali&s;t, or even nomenclator, if he had been acquainted with
<PB N="334" REF="354">
them, would have ventured to refer the&s;e two birds to the &s;ame genus.</P>
<P>The Hocco loves to inhabit the mountains, if we may infer this from the import of the name <HI>Tepetototl,</HI> which, in the Mexican language, &s;ig|nifies <HI>mountain-bird.</HI> When kept in cages it is fed on bread, pa&s;te, and other &s;uch things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez.</NOTE>.

<P>Sir Hans Sloane &s;ays, that its tail is only two inches long, which Edwards conceives to be printed by mi&s;take for ten. But I &s;hould imagine that this correction is too general and unlimited; for I ob&s;erve that Aldrovandus a&s;&s;erts, from a drawing of a bird of this &s;ort, that it has no tail. And on the other hand, Barrere relates, from his own ob&s;ervations which he made on the &s;pot, that the female of his Amazon Hocco, which is the Cura&s;&s;ow-Hocco of Bri&s;&s;on, has a &s;hort tail. Whence it appears that what Sir Hans Sloane has affirmed with regard to the Hocco in general, mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to the female only, at lea&s;t in certain tribes. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Crax-Alector:</HI> <Q REND="inline">Its cere is yel|low, its body black, its belly white.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>We have figured this bird in the <HI>Planches En|lumin&eacute;es</HI> under the name of <HI>Stone of Cayenne,</HI> which is really what it bears in the <HI>Royal Me|nagerie,</HI> where the drawing was made after the life.

<P>This bird re&s;embles the preceding in many re&s;pects; but it differs in &s;ome particulars. Its head is not tufted like the other; the &s;welling on the bill is larger, of the &s;hape of a pear, and of a blue colour. Fernandez &s;ays, that this tubercle is as hard as a &s;tone; and this is the rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, why it was called fir&s;t the <HI>Stone-bird,</HI> and then the <HI>Stone</HI>; for the &s;ame cau&s;e that it was fir&s;t named <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> or <HI>Cu&s;hew-bird,</HI> and <HI>Numidian-hen,</HI> from this bump, which &s;ome have conceived to re&s;emble the American nut, called <HI>cu&s;co</HI> or <HI>cu&s;hew</HI>; and others have imagined that it is like the ca&s;que of the Pin|tado.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="356">
But the&s;e are not the only differences which di&s;tingui&s;h the Pauxi from the preceding Hoccos: it is &s;maller, its bill is &s;tronger, more hooked, and almo&s;t as much &s;o as that of the parrot. Be&s;ides, it is much more &s;eldom brought to Europe than the Hocco. Edwards, who &s;aw the Hocco in almo&s;t every collection, could not meet with a &s;ingle Ca&s;hew or Pauxi in the cour&s;e of his inquiries.</P>
<P>The elegant black of its plumage has blue and purple reflections, which cannot be repre&s;ented in the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This bird perches on trees; but it lays on the ground like the phea&s;ants, leads its young, and even calls them together. The brood live fir&s;t on infects, and afterwards, when they are grown up, they feed on fruits, &s;eeds, and whatever is proper for poultry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aublet and Fernandez.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Pauxi is as gentle, or, if we chu&s;e, as &s;tupid, as the other Hoccos; for it will &s;it &s;till though fired at &s;ix times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; yet, ac|cording to Fernandez, it will not &s;uffer it&s;elf to be caught or handled; and M. Aublet informs me, that it is found in uninhabited places, which is probably one of the cau&s;es why it is &s;o rarely brought to Europe.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on &s;ays, that the male differs from the female only by the colours, having brown where the other is black; but that they are in other re&s;pects alike. Aldrovandus, however, admit|ting

that the plumage is in general brown, ob|&s;erves that its wings and tail are cinereous; that the bill is le&s;s hooked, and that it has no tail; which would be a feature of coincidence with the Amazon Hocco of Barrere, in which, as we have already noticed, the tail of the female is much &s;horter than that of the male: and the&s;e are not the only American birds which want the tail; in a certain part of that continent, the poultry tran&s;ported from Europe lo&s;e their tail and rump, as we have already ob&s;erved in the hi&s;tory of the cock. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Crax Pauxi:</HI> <Q REND="inline">Its cere is blue; a cre&s;ted bunch on its no&s;trils; its body blacki&s;h; its belly and the tip of its tail, white.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="338" REF="358">
According to that author, the Hoazin is not quite &s;o large as a turkey-hen; its bill is hooked; its brea&s;t of a yellowi&s;h white; the wings and tail marked with &s;pots or white rays an inch a&s;under; the back, the upper &s;ide of the neck, the &s;ides of the head, are of a tawny brown; the legs are of a dirty colour. It has a cre&s;t com|po&s;ed of feathers that are whiti&s;h on one &s;ide and black on the other; this cre&s;t is taller and differently &s;haped from that of the Hoccos; and it does not appear that they can rai&s;e and depre&s;s it at plea&s;ure: its head al&s;o is &s;maller and its neck more &s;lender.</P>
<P>Its voice is very &s;trong, and more like a bray|ing than a cry. It is &s;aid that it calls its own name, probably in a &s;ad frightful tone. Nothing more was wanted among &s;avage tribes to place it in the cla&s;s of inau&s;picious birds; and as the human mind is naturally prone to imagine the object of dread endowed with va&s;t power, the&s;e rude people draw from it remedies for the mo&s;t inveterate and alarming di&s;orders. They do not appear, however, to feed on it: they ab&s;tain per|haps through fear, which it in&s;pires; or per|haps from an aver&s;ion, becau&s;e it lives common|ly on &s;erpents. It inhabits generally exten|&s;ive fore&s;ts, where it perches on trees be&s;ide water, to watch and &s;urpri&s;e the&s;e reptiles. It is found in the warme&s;t parts of Mexico.

<P>This bird has named it&s;elf; for its cry is, ac|cording to Marcgrave, <HI>Yacou</HI>; whence is derived the name <HI>Iacupema.</HI> I have preferred that of Yacou as the ea&s;ie&s;t, and the be&s;t adapted.</P>
<P>Marcgrave is the fir&s;t who has &s;poken of this bird. Some naturali&s;ts, copying him, have ranged it with the phea&s;ants; others, &s;uch as Bri&s;&s;on and Edwards, have cla&s;&s;ed it with the turkies. But it is neither the one nor the other:&mdash;it is not a turkey, though it has a red &s;kin under the neck; for it differs in many re|&s;pects; in its &s;ize, which is &s;carcely equal to that of a common hen; its head is partly co|vered with feathers, and its cre&s;t is much more like that of the Hoccos than that of the cre&s;ted turkey; and its legs have no &s;purs:&mdash;be&s;ides, it has not the bunch of hard hair under the neck, nor the mu&s;cular caruncle on the bill, as in the turkey-cock, nor does it expand the feathers of its tail. On the other hand, it is not a phea&s;ant; for it has the long and &s;lender bill and the cre&s;t of
<PB N="341" REF="361">
the Hoccos; its neck is &s;lender; it has a fle&s;hy membrane under the throat; its tail-feathers are all of an equal length; and its di&s;po&s;itions are mild and gentle: all which characters di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from the phea&s;ants, and its cry differs from both that of the phea&s;ant and of the tur|key. But what &s;hall we then make it? It &s;hall be a Yacou, having &s;ome analogies with the turkey (the fle&s;hy membrane under the throat and the tail compo&s;ed of equal quills); with the phea&s;ants (the eye encircled with black &s;kin, the wings &s;hort, and the tail long); with the Hocco (the long tail, the cre&s;t, and mild di&s;po&s;ition); but which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the&s;e by numerous and marked differences, and therefore con&s;titutes a &s;eparate &s;pecies.</P>
<P>We can hardly doubt that the <HI>Guan</HI> or <HI>Quan</HI> of Edwards, &s;o called, according to him, in the We&s;t Indies, probably by &s;ome other tribe of Savages, is at lea&s;t a variety of the Yacou, from which it differs only in being not &s;o tall, and its eyes of another colour; but &s;uch differences may take place in the &s;ame &s;pecies, e&s;pecially &s;ince it is dome&s;ticated.</P>
<P>Black mixed with brown is the prevailing co|lour of its plumage, but with different reflections, and &s;ome white &s;treaks on the neck, brea&s;t, belly, &amp;c.; the legs are of a bright red.</P>

Ray con&s;iders it as of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the coxolitli of Fernandez; but that bird is much larger, and has not under its throat that fle&s;hy membrane which characterizes the Yacou; and for this rea&s;on I have cla&s;&s;ed it with the Hoccos properly &s;o called. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Penelope Cri&s;tata:</HI> <Q REND="inline">Its head is cre&s;ted with erect feathers, its temples violet.</Q></NOTE></P>

<PB N="343" REF="363">

I mu&s;t own that I have al&s;o perceived &s;ome differences; the quills of the tail are like organ pipes, as in the phea&s;ant, and not equal, as in the Guan of Edwards; and the no&s;trils are not &s;o near the origin of the bill: but it would not be difficult to in&s;tance a number of &s;pecies in which the female differs &s;till more from the male, and in which there are varieties that are more remote from each other.</P>
<P>M. Aublet, who &s;aw this bird in its native coun|try, tells me, that it is ea&s;ily tamed, and that its fle&s;h is delicate, and richer and &s;uperior in &s;uc|culency to that of the phea&s;ant. He adds, that it is a real turkey, only &s;maller than what is naturalized in Europe: and this is &s;till another point of re&s;emblance to the Yacou, its having been taken for a turkey.</P>
<P>This bird is not only found in Cayenne; but, if we may judge from the identity of the name, it inhabits the country which is watered by the maje&s;tic &s;tream of the Amazons; for Barrere &s;peaks of the Marail of the Amazons, as a bird who&s;e plumage is black, its bill green, and no

<P>I give this name, which is expre&s;&s;ive of its cry, to that beautiful bird of the Antilles de|&s;cribed by Father du Tertre.</P>
<P>If all the American birds that have been taken for phea&s;ants mu&s;t be referred to the Hocco tribe, the Caracara ought to be ranged with the&s;e; for the French inhabitants of the Antilles, and Father du Tertre after them, have applied to it the name of <HI>Phea&s;ant.</HI> <Q REND="inline">This Phea&s;ant is,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">a very beautiful bird, about the &s;ize of a capon, taller, and with legs like tho&s;e of the peacock.

We have al|ready been more than once embarra&s;&s;ed in this chaos of terms; and I am afraid that the article of the Partridge will not be the la&s;t which re|quires a critical examination.</P>
<P>I take the Common Partridge for the ba&s;is and fir&s;t &s;pecies of the genus, as being the be&s;t known, and therefore the fitte&s;t &s;ubject for compa|ri&s;on.&mdash;I &s;hall admit one variety and three per|manent breeds.</P>
<P>The&s;e permanent breeds are, 1. The <HI>Common Gray Partridge</HI>; and, as a variety of it, the <HI>White Gray Partridge</HI> of Bri&s;&s;on. 2. The <HI>Da|ma&s;cus Partridge,</HI> not that of Belon, which is the Hazel Grous, but that of Aldrovandus, which is &s;maller than our Gray Partridge, and which
<PB N="350" REF="370">
appears to be the &s;ame with the Little Partridge, a bird of pa&s;&s;age well known to our &s;port&s;men. 3. The <HI>Mountain Partridge,</HI> which is figured in No. 136. of the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es,</HI> and which &s;eems to form the &s;hade between the Gray and the Red Partridges.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd &s;pecies I range the Red Par|tridge, into which I admit two permanent breeds in France, and one variety, and two foreign breeds.</P>
<P>The two permanent Red Partridges which are found in France are, 1. No. 150. <HI>Planches Enlu|min&eacute;es.</HI> 2. The <HI>Greek Partridge,</HI> Pl. 231.</P>
<P>The two foreign &s;pecies are, 1. The <HI>Red Bar|bary Partridge</HI> of Edwards, Pl. 70. 2. The <HI>Rufous-brea&s;ted Partridge,</HI> which is found on the banks of the Gambra.</P>
<P>As the plumage of the Red Partridge is liable to a&s;&s;ume &s;hades of white like that of the Gray Partridge, thence re&s;ults a variety exactly &s;imi|lar to that in the latter.</P>
<P>From this genus I exclude &s;everal &s;pecies which have been improperly referred to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Francolin, which we have removed from the Partridges, becau&s;e it differs from them not only by its general &s;hape, but by &s;ome par|ticular characters, as in the &s;purs, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. The bird called by Bri&s;&s;on the <HI>Senegal Partridge,</HI> and which he makes his eighth &s;pecies. This bird appears to me to be more a-kin to the Francolins than to the Partridges;
<PB N="351" REF="371">
and as it has two &s;purs on each leg, I &s;hall give it the epithet of <HI>Double Spur.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The African Red Partridge.</P>
<P N="4">4. The third foreign &s;pecies, called by Bri&s;&s;on the <HI>Great Partridge of Brazil,</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the <HI>Macucagua</HI> of Marcgrave, from whom he copies the de&s;cription, and confounds it with the <HI>Agamia</HI> from Cayenne, which is a bird wholly different from both.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Yambou</HI> of Marcgrave, which is the Brazilian Partridge of Bri&s;&s;on, and which has neither the &s;hape, the habits, nor the charac|ters of the Partridge; &s;ince, according to Bri&s;|&s;on him&s;elf, it has a long bill, perches upon trees, and lays blue eggs.</P>
<P N="6">6. The American Partridge of Cate&s;by and Bri&s;&s;on, which al&s;o perches, and prefers the woods to the cleared grounds; a character which does not belong to the Partridge.</P>
<P N="7">7. A multitude of American birds, which the herd of travellers have called Partridges from &s;ome &s;light re&s;emblance inaccurately ob&s;erved. Such are the birds known at Guadeloupe under the names of <HI>Red Partridges, Gray Partridges,</HI> and <HI>Black Partridges</HI>; though, according to the accounts of per&s;ons better informed, they are pigeons or turtles; &s;ince they have neither the bill nor the fle&s;h of the Partridge, perch on trees, where they build their ne&s;ts, lay only two eggs, and &s;ince the young do not run as &s;oon as they quit the &s;hell, but are fed by the parents in the
<PB N="352" REF="372">
ne&s;t like turtles. Such too are mo&s;t probably tho&s;e Partridges which Carreri &s;aw on the mountains of the Havannah; &s;uch the <HI>Man|bouris,</HI> the <HI>Pega&s;&s;ous,</HI> and the <HI>Pegacans</HI> of Lery; and &s;uch perhaps are &s;ome American birds which I have ranked in the cla&s;s of Partridges on the authority of writers, when their relations &s;eemed not contradicted by facts; though I mu&s;t own, that it is not likely birds &s;o heavy could cro&s;s the intervening ocean.</P>

<P>Though Aldrovandus, judging of other coun|tries from his own, a&s;&s;erts that Gray Par|tridges abound in every part of the globe; it is certain that there are none in the i&s;land of Crete; and it is probable that they never inha|bited Greece; for Athenaeus remarks with &s;ur|prize, that all the Italian Partridges had not a red bill like tho&s;e of Greece. Nor are they
<PB N="353" REF="373">
equally &s;pread through Europe: they &s;eem to avoid the extremes both of heat and cold, and are found neither in Africa nor in Lapland. They thrive mo&s;t in the temperate parts of France and Germany. It is true, indeed, that Boterius &s;ays that they do not inhabit Ireland; but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the Red Partridges, which are not found even in England, (accord|ing to the be&s;t authors of that country,) and which have not penetrated in that direction be|yond the i&s;lands of Guern&s;ey and Jer&s;ey. The Common Partridge is frequent in Sweden, where Linnaeus tells us it winters under the &s;now in a kind of burrow, which has a double entrance. This manner of lodging during the &s;evere &s;ea|&s;on, is very like that of the Ptarmigan, which we have already de&s;cribed; and if this fact were not averred by a man of &s;o high reputation as Linnaeus, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;take; e&s;pe|cially as in France the long winters, with great falls of &s;now, prove fatal to numbers of Par|tridges. La&s;tly, as it is a bird of laborious flight, I am much inclined to &s;u&s;pect that it has never migrated into America; and I &s;hould imagine, that tho&s;e birds of the New World which are referred to this genus, would be &s;epa|rated from it if they were better known.</P>
<P>The Gray Partridge differs in many re&s;pects from the Red; but what makes me con&s;ider them as di&s;tinct kinds, is that, according to the
<PB N="354" REF="374">
remark of the few &s;port&s;men who can make ob|&s;ervations, though they &s;ometimes inhabit the &s;ame &s;pot, they never a&s;&s;ociate together. A vacant male of the one &s;pecies will &s;ometimes, indeed, con&s;ort with a pair of the other, follow them, and even di&s;cover &s;ymptoms of jealou&s;y; yet it never copulates with the female, though it is reduced to ab&s;tinence, and beholds conti|nually the &s;weets of conjugal felicity, and feels the enlivening influence of &s;pring.</P>
<P>The Gray Partridge is al&s;o of a gentler na|ture than the Red, and not difficult to tame; and when not teazed, it &s;oon becomes fami|liar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray a&s;&s;erts the contrary; but as he confe&s;&s;es that the Red Partridges are never &s;een in England, his authority will not in this in&s;tance weigh again&s;t actual ob&s;ervers.</NOTE>. However, they never could be form|ed into flocks that would be driven, as has been done with the Red Partridges: for the Red Partridges are tho&s;e which travellers, as Olina remarks, de&s;cribe as being bred in nu|merous flocks on &s;ome i&s;lands of the Medi|terranean. The Gray Partridges have al&s;o a more &s;ocial turn, &s;ince each family continues in a &s;ingle body, or covey, till the pairing of love. If a hatch, from &s;ome accident, does not com|pletely &s;ucceed, the families recruit their &s;trength by uniting with others, and adopting the feeble remnants of &s;uch as have &s;uffered mo&s;t &s;everely from the &s;port&s;men: &s;o that about the end of
<PB N="355" REF="375">
&s;ummer they often compo&s;e new coveys more numerous than at fir&s;t, and which continue a&s;&s;ociated till next year.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are fond of corn countries, e&s;pe|cially where the fields are in high cultivation, and manured with marl; no doubt becau&s;e they find there abundance of food, both grain and in&s;ects; and perhaps the &s;aline quality of the marl, which contributes &s;o much to the fer|tility of the &s;oil, is al&s;o &s;uited to their con&s;ti|tution or ta&s;te. Gray Partridges prefer the open country, and never re&s;ort to cop&s;es or vineyards, but when they are pur&s;ued by the fowler, or by the bird of prey: yet they do not lodge in the depths of the fore&s;ts; and I have been frequently told that they never pa&s;s the night among bu&s;hes or thickets: however, a Partridge's ne&s;t was found in a bu&s;h at the root of a vine. They begin about the end of winter, after the inten&s;e fro&s;ts, to pair: that is, each male &s;elects his female companion, and retires. But this new arrangement is not effected without violent di&s;putes among the males, and &s;ometimes even among the females. War and love are in mo&s;t animals in&s;eparable, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e which, like the Par|tridges, are &s;timulated by an ardent appetite. The females of this &s;pecies, like the common hens, lay without having had intercour&s;e with the male. When the Partridges are once paired, they never part, but live in the clo&s;e&s;t and the
<PB N="356" REF="376">
mo&s;t faithful union. Sometimes, after they are paired, the weather grows &s;evere, and then they all gather together, and again form the covey.</P>
<P>Gray Partridges &s;eldom breed, at lea&s;t in France, before the end of March, above a month after they have begun to pair; and they do not lay before May, or even June, if the winter has la&s;ted long. They make their ne&s;t, in general, with little care or preparation: &s;ome gra&s;s or &s;traw, &s;trewed roughly in the print of an ox or a hor&s;e's foot, is all they require. It is ob&s;erved, however, that the older and more experienced females take greater pains with their ne&s;ts than young ones, and are more careful both in guarding again&s;t inundation, and in chu&s;ing a &s;pot &s;omewhat elevated and pro|tected naturally by bru&s;h-wood. They gene|rally lay from fifteen to twenty eggs, and &s;ome|times twenty-five; but the number is much &s;maller when the bird is either very young or very old: &s;uch too is the &s;econd hatch made by Partridges of the proper age, when the fir&s;t has been de&s;troyed. The eggs are nearly of the &s;ame colour with tho&s;e of pigeons: Pliny &s;ays that they are white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. x. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>. The incubation la&s;ts about three weeks, more or le&s;s according to the degree of heat of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The female takes upon her&s;elf the whole ta&s;k of covering, and, during that time, &s;he under|goes
<PB N="357" REF="377">
a con&s;iderable moult; for all the feathers of the belly drop. She &s;its with great a&s;&s;iduity; and, it is &s;aid, that &s;he never leaves her eggs without &s;trewing them with leaves. The male, attentive to his mate, generally &s;ettles near the ne&s;t, ready to accompany her when &s;he ri&s;es in que&s;t of food; and his attachment is &s;o faithful and &s;teady, that he prefers this laborious office to the free plea&s;ures which the calls of other Partridges &s;olicit him to enjoy: to the&s;e he &s;ometimes replies, but never quits his &s;tation to indulge his appetite. At the expiration of the regular time, if the &s;ea&s;on be favourable and the incubation &s;ucceed, the chicks pierce the &s;hell with great ea&s;e, and as &s;oon as they have extri|cated them&s;elves, they begin to run, carrying &s;ometimes a part of the &s;hell with them. It happens &s;ometimes, however, that they are un|able to bur&s;t from their pri&s;on, and that they die in the &s;truggle. In this ca&s;e, the feathers of the young bird are found glued to the inner &s;urface of the &s;hell, which mu&s;t happen when|ever the egg is expo&s;ed to too great heat. To remedy this malady, dip the eggs five or &s;ix minutes in water, &s;o that the moi&s;ture may &s;oak through the &s;hell and loo&s;en the feathers. This kind of bathing may al&s;o perhaps refre&s;h the young bird, and give it additional &s;trength to force a pa&s;&s;age. The &s;ame happens with regard to pigeons, and many other u&s;eful birds, which
<PB N="358" REF="378">
might be &s;aved by the method I have de&s;cribed, or &s;ome analogous experiment.</P>
<P>The male, though it has no &s;hare in the in|cubation, a&s;&s;i&s;ts the mother in rai&s;ing the young. They lead them in common, continually call them together, point out to them their proper food, and teach them to find it by &s;cratching the ground with their nails. It is not uncom|mon to di&s;cover them &s;quatted be&s;ide each other, covering the chickens with their wings, who&s;e heads project on all &s;ides, pre&s;enting very lively eyes. In &s;uch ca&s;e, the parents are not ea&s;ily flu&s;hed; and the &s;port&s;man, who is attentive to the pre&s;ervation of his game, avoids di&s;turbing &s;o intere&s;ting an office. But if the pointer comes too near, or runs in upon them, the male is always the fir&s;t that &s;prings, venting his angui&s;h in a peculiar cry, and appropriated to this emergence. He &s;tops thirty or forty paces di&s;tant, and &s;ometimes even he returns upon the dog and beats it with his wings,&mdash;to &s;uch a degree does parental affection in|&s;pire courage in the mo&s;t timid animals! Sometimes that tender &s;entiment in&s;pires in the&s;e birds a &s;ort of prudence, and &s;ugge&s;ts ex|pedients for &s;aving the brood. When the male &s;prings in &s;uch ca&s;es, he has been ob&s;erved to fly &s;lowly, and hanging his wing, as if to decoy the enemy into a pur&s;uit, in the expectation of an ea&s;y prey; while the bird keeps always be|fore him, but at &s;uch a &s;hort di&s;tance as con|tinually
<PB N="359" REF="379">
to afford hopes, till the &s;port&s;man is carried away from the covey. On the other hand, the female &s;prings &s;hortly after the male, and &s;hoots to a much greater di&s;tance, and in|variably in a different direction. Immediately after &s;he has alighted, &s;he returns back running along the furrow, and finds her chickens &s;cat|tered and &s;quatted among the gra&s;s and the leaves; ha&s;tily collects them, and before the dog has returned from the eager pur&s;uit of the male, &s;he has led them to a di&s;tant &s;pot, with|out giving the &s;lighte&s;t notice to the &s;port&s;man by the noi&s;e in retreating. It is an ob&s;ervation with re&s;pect to animals which holds very gene|rally, that the ardor for copulation is the mea|&s;ure of the &s;olicitude for their progeny. The Partridge is an in&s;tance: few birds are &s;o amorous, and few di&s;cover &s;uch an a&s;&s;iduous or &s;uch bold vigilance for their young. This &s;trength of affection &s;ometimes degenerates into rancour, which the mother di&s;covers to other coveys, pur&s;uing them and tearing them with her bill.</P>
<P>The legs of the young Partridges are at fir&s;t yellow, which colour grows lighter, running into white, and afterwards turns brown, and at la&s;t, when the bird is three or four years old, it deepens into black. This is a method of di&s;|covering their age: another is drawn from the appearance of the la&s;t feather of the wing,
<PB N="360" REF="380">
which is pointed after the fir&s;t moult, but in the following year is quite round.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t food of young Partridges is ants eggs, and the &s;mall in&s;ects which they find on the ground and among the herbage. Tho&s;e which are fed within doors refu&s;e grain for a long time, and probably this is not their proper aliment till they are grown up. They always prefer lettuce, &s;uccory, chickweed, &s;ow-thi&s;|tle, ground&s;el, and even the &s;hoots of &s;pring|ing corn. In the month of November their &s;tomach is found filled with that &s;ub&s;tance, and during the winter they learn to &s;earch for the tender herbage beneath the &s;now. But when the ground is &s;tiff with fro&s;t, they re&s;ort to the mild &s;prings, and crop the herbs on their mar|gins, though not &s;uited to their con&s;titution.&mdash;In &s;ummer, they are never ob&s;erved to drink.</P>
<P>Partridges are three months old when the red tint di&s;covers it&s;elf; for the Gray Partridges al&s;o have red on the &s;ide of the temples between the eye and the ear, and its appearance is a critical period with the&s;e birds, as with all others in like ca&s;es, &s;ince it advances the adult &s;tate. Previous to this they are delicate, their wing feeble, and they dread the damps; but after they have re|covered from the &s;hock, they become hardy, and begin to ply their wings, to &s;pring together and con&s;tantly keep company; and though the co|vey be di&s;per&s;ed, they learn to a&s;&s;emble again, in &s;pite of the precautions of the &s;port&s;man.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="381">
They a&s;&s;emble by a call; every body knows the cry of the Partridge, which is not very plea|&s;ant; it is rather a &s;harp grating noi&s;e like that of a &s;cythe, than a warble. The mythologi&s;ts, &s;truck with this re&s;emblance, metamorpho&s;ed the inventor of that in&s;trument into a Partridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es, Book viii.</BIBL></NOTE>. The note of the male differs not from the female, except in being louder and more drawling. The male is be&s;ides di&s;tingui&s;hed from the female by a blunt &s;pur on each leg, and a black mark like a hor&s;e-hoe under the belly, which is not found in the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>In this &s;pecies, as in many others, there are more males hatched than females<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">About a third more, according to Ray.</NOTE>; and it is a matter of &s;ome con&s;equence to de&s;troy the &s;u|pernumerary males, which di&s;turb the pairs al|ready formed and check multiplication. The common method of catching them is to call them in the pairing &s;ea&s;on by means of a female, and the be&s;t for this purpo&s;e is one that has been taken old. The males flock to the female's voice, and fall into the fowler's &s;nares. So head-long they ru&s;h into danger, as &s;ometimes to alight on hou&s;es, or even on the &s;houlder of the bird-catcher. The mo&s;t proper &s;ort of &s;nares, and what are the lea&s;t liable to accidents, are a kind of large weel nets of a tunnel &s;hape, into which the Partridges are driven by a per&s;on di&s;|gui&s;ed
<PB N="362" REF="382">
like a cow, who, to aid the deception, holds in his hand one of the bells u&s;ually fa&s;tened to the necks of cattle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>. After they are entangled in the lines, the &s;upernumerary males are &s;elected, and &s;ometimes even all the males are taken, and the females are &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>The Gray Partridges are &s;edentary birds, which not only continue in the &s;ame country, but which &s;tray as little as po&s;&s;ible from the neighbourhood where they are bred, and they always return again. They fear much the bird of prey; when they perceive him, they crowd clo&s;e one upon another, but their formidable enemy di&s;covers them from a di&s;tance, approaches them glancing along the ground, in order to &s;pring one of which he may catch on the wing. Surrounded by &s;o many enemies, and expo&s;ed to &s;o many dangers, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e that few will reach a great age. Some fix the period of their life at &s;even years, and a&s;&s;ert that, in their &s;econd year, they have attained their full vigour, and give over laying in the &s;ixth. Olina &s;ays, that they live twelve or fifteen years.</P>
<P>It has been tried to breed Partridges in parks, for the purpo&s;e of &s;tocking grounds not inha|bited by them. The experiment has &s;ucceeded, and it has been found that they may be rai&s;ed nearly the &s;ame way as Phea&s;ants, only no de|pendence mu&s;t be had on the eggs of dome&s;tic
<PB N="363" REF="383">
Partridges. Seldom do they lay, when reduced to that &s;tate, and &s;till &s;eldomer do they pair and co|pulate; and they never have been ob&s;erved to hatch in tho&s;e inclo&s;ures where the Phea&s;ants &s;o readily breed. We mu&s;t therefore &s;earch in the fields for the eggs of free Partridges, and &s;et them under common hens. A &s;ingle hen can hatch about two dozen and rear that number of young, which will follow this &s;tranger as well as they would do their natural mother, but they are not &s;o well acquainted with her voice. They become however familiarized to it in a certain degree, and the Partridge thus bred, retains through the re&s;t of its life the habit of calling when &s;he hears the clucking of hens.</P>
<P>The Gray Partridges are much le&s;s delicate to rai&s;e than the Red &s;ort, and not &s;o &s;ubject to di&s;|ea&s;es, at lea&s;t in France, which it would &s;eem is their congenial climate. It is unnece&s;&s;ary even to give them ants eggs, and they may be fed like the common poultry on bread crumbs, hard eggs, &amp;c. When they have grown &s;tout and begin to &s;eek their food, they may be let loo&s;e where they are bred, and from which place they never, as I have already noticed, remove to any great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Common Partridge has long been e&s;teemed delicious and whole&s;ome food. It has two properties which are &s;eldom com|bined; it is juicy, and yet not fat. The&s;e birds have twenty-two quills in each wing, and

eighteen in the tail, of which the four mid-ones are of the &s;ame colour with the back<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The no&s;trils, which are at the origin of the bill, are more than half covered with a &s;creen of the &s;ame colour with the bill, but of a &s;ofter &s;ub&s;tance, as in the common hens. The naked &s;pace between the eye and the ear is of a brighter red in the male than the female.</P>

<P>The Grayi&s;h White Partridge is by no means &s;o white as the Ptarmigan; the ground only is of that colour, and is &s;ullied with the &s;ame &s;pecks as in the Common Partridge, di&s;tributed in the &s;ame manner. But what fully proves that the difference in the colour of the plumage is only accidental, and forms a variety of the Gray Par|tridge, is, that, according to naturali&s;ts and even according to &s;port&s;men, it mingles and a&s;&s;ociates with that &s;pecies. One of my friends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Le Roi, <HI>Lieutenant des Cha&s;&s;es</HI></BIBL> at Ver&s;ailles.</NOTE> &s;aw a covey of ten or twelve Partridges which were entirely white, and was witne&s;s to their pairing with the common &s;ort in the breeding &s;ea&s;on.

<P>This Partridge, de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus, is probably the &s;mall migratory &s;pecies, which has been ob&s;erved at different times in &s;everal pro|vinces of France.</P>
<P>It differs from the Gray Partridge not only in its &s;ize, which is always inferior, but by its bill, which is longer, by the yellow colour of its legs, and above all, the habit of changing its re&s;idence. It has been &s;een in Brie, and in other places, pa&s;&s;ing in numerous flocks, and pur&s;uing its journey without halting. A game-keeper in the neighbourhood of Montbard &s;aw la&s;t March (1770), a flight of one hundred and fifty or two hundred, which &s;eemed to turn a&s;ide and &s;u&s;|pend their progre&s;s at the noi&s;e of the call, but were entirely gone the next day. This &s;imple fact, which is undoubted, points out the analogy
<PB N="367" REF="387">
and the difference between this &s;pecies and the common &s;ort. Their being drawn by the call &s;hewed their affinity; their rapid flight through a country equally &s;uited to the Gray and Red Partridges, which both re&s;ide in it the whole year, denotes another in&s;tinct, and con&s;equently another organization, and at lea&s;t another fa|mily.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not confound this Dama&s;cus or Syrian Partridge with the <HI>Syroperdix</HI> of Aelian, found in the vicinity of Antioch; who&s;e plu|mage was black, the bill fulvous, the fle&s;h firmer and better flavoured, and the di&s;po&s;ition more &s;avage than that of other Partridges: for the colours we &s;ee do not corre&s;pond, and Aelian does not tell us that this <HI>Syroperdix</HI> is a bird of pa&s;&s;age. He adds, as a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that it &s;wallows &s;tones; which however is very common in the granivorous tribes. Scaliger mentions a remarkable fact, to which he was witne&s;s, and which bears &s;ome relation to the pre&s;ent; it is that in Ga&s;cony, where the land is very &s;andy, their fle&s;h was mixed with minute particles, which was very di&s;agreeable. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Dama&s;cus Partridge, <HI>Tetrao Dama&s;cenus:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">It has a naked &s;affron &s;pot under its eyes, its tail is ferruginous, its brea&s;t brown, its feet yellow.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>I make this Partridge a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, &s;ince it re&s;embles neither the Gray nor the Red &s;ort. It would be difficult to decide to which of the&s;e kinds we ought to refer it; for if, on the one hand, it be certain they &s;ometimes breed with Gray Partridges; on the other, their ordinary re&s;idence is on mountains; and the red colour of their bill and legs, al&s;o &s;hews a clo&s;e relation to the Gray Partridge, and I am &s;trongly in|clined to &s;u&s;pect that they &s;ometimes even con&s;ort with the&s;e.

<P>Whatever the ancients have &s;aid on the &s;ub|ject of Partridges, we mu&s;t refer to the Red kinds, and e&s;pecially to the <HI>Bartavelle.</HI> Ari&s;totle was undoubtedly be&s;t acquainted with the Greek Partridge, nor is it probable that he knew any but the Red Partridges; &s;ince the&s;e are the only Par|tridges that are found in Greece, or in the i&s;lands of the Mediterranean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, and in all probability in the part of A&s;ia conquered by Alexander, &s;ituated in nearly the &s;ame latitude with Greece and the Mediterranean<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It appears that only the Red Partridge was known to the Jews, &s;ince they repre&s;ent it as an inhabitant of the mountains: <Q REND="inline">The king of I&s;rael is come out to &s;eek a flea, <HI>as one would hunt a Partridge on the mountains.</HI></Q> <BIBL>1 Samuel, chap. 26. ver. 20.</BIBL></NOTE>, and which was probably the &s;ource of Ari&s;totle's principal
information. With re&s;pect to the &s;ucceeding naturali&s;ts, &s;uch as Pliny,
Athenaeus, &amp;c. we plainly &s;ee that though they were acquainted with other
Partridges in Italy be&s;ides the Red, they were contented with barely copying
what Ari&s;totle had &s;aid. It is <PB N="370" REF="390"> indeed true that the

Par|tridges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some

infer any real di&s;tinction of &s;pecies: for this diver&s;ity often
re|&s;ults from the age or &s;ex, has place even in the &s;ame individual, and
may be the effect of &s;ome local cau&s;e or of the influence of climate; which
the ancients them&s;elves admitted, &s;ince Athenaeus a&s;&s;erts that the
Partridges which pa&s;&s;ed from Attica into Boeotia were known to change their
cry<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, Theophra&s;tus,
who al&s;o remarks &s;ome varieties in the notes of the Partridges, ac|cording
to the countries which they inhabit, certainly &s;uppo&s;es them not to be all
of different &s;pecies; for he de&s;cribes the different voices in his
treati&s;e "<HI>On the various Notes of Birds of the &s;ame kind.</HI>"</P>
<P>On examining the accounts which the ancients have given re&s;pecting this bird, I di&s;cover many accurate facts and ob&s;ervations disfigured by a heap of exaggerations and fables; on which &s;ome moderns<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE> have &s;hewn their plea&s;antry, though it required no great talents to ridicule. I &s;hall endeavour to trace the origin of the&s;e tales from the nature and in&s;tincts of the Partridge.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle relates that this bird is fond of rolling in the du&s;t, has a craw, a gizzard, and very &s;mall <HI>caeca</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. ii. cap. ult. and lib. vi. 4.</BIBL></NOTE>; that it lives fifteen years and
<PB N="371" REF="391">
more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. ix. 7.</BIBL> Ge&s;ner has inadvertently put twenty-five years in his ver&s;ion, which error has been copied by Aldrovandus. Athenaeus makes Ari&s;totle &s;ay that the female lives longer than the male, as u&s;ual in birds.</NOTE>; that, like all other birds of a laborious flight, it builds no ne&s;t, but lays its eggs on the open ground, on a little herbage or leaves &s;trewed carele&s;sly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. vi. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>, though in a &s;pot of good a&s;pect, and &s;heltered from the attacks of rapacious birds; that in this &s;pecies, which is of a very amorous di&s;po&s;ition, the males fight ob&s;tinately with each other in love &s;ea&s;on, and that at that time their te&s;ticles are di&s;tinctly &s;een, though in winter<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. iii. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> they are hardly vi&s;ible; that the females can lay eggs without any intercour&s;e with the male<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Id. ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>; that both &s;exes copulate by opening the mouth and darting out the tongue<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. v. 5</BIBL>. Avicenna has thence been led to &s;ay, that the Partridges work up their pa&s;&s;ion by the clo&s;e&s;t ki&s;&s;es and care&s;&s;es, like the pigeons; but this is a mi&s;take.</NOTE>; that their hatch commonly con&s;i&s;ts of twelve or fifteen eggs; that &s;ometimes they cannot retain their eggs, but drop them wherever they happen to be<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. ix. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>. But after mentioning the&s;e facts, which are in|conte&s;tible, and which are confirmed by the ob|&s;ervations of the moderns, Ari&s;totle adds many circum&s;tances where the truth is di&s;gui&s;ed, and which mu&s;t be anali&s;ed, in order to extract what is valuable from the mixture.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, 1. That the female Partridges lay mo&s;t of their eggs in a concealed &s;pot, to &s;ave
<PB N="372" REF="392">
them from the male, who &s;eeks to de&s;troy them, as impeding his plea&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Id. ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This is reckoned ridiculous by Willughby; but I am inclined to think that he has been too ha&s;ty in pa&s;&s;ing judg|ment, for if we di&s;tingui&s;h between the fact ob|&s;erved and the intention implied, the a&s;&s;ertion of Ari&s;totle is literally true, and is nothing more than that the Partridge, like all the other females of the feathered race, is indu&s;trious to conceal her ne&s;t; le&s;t the males, e&s;pecially the &s;upernu|merary ones, &s;eeking to copulate in the time of incubation, di&s;turb the function by the gratifica|tion of their appetites. For this rea&s;on it has always been recommended to de&s;troy the &s;uper|fluous males, as one of the mo&s;t efficacious means of advancing the multiplication of the breed, not only of Partridges, but of other birds in the &s;avage &s;tate.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle adds, 2dly, That the female Par|tridge divides her eggs into two hatches, one of which &s;he entru&s;ts to the male, until the young are educated<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. vi. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>. This is ab&s;olutely incompatible with the propen&s;ity to break the eggs, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be implanted in the male. But if we would reconcile Ari&s;totle with him&s;elf and with truth, we may &s;ay, that as the female does not lay all her eggs in the &s;ame &s;pot; &s;ince &s;he cannot retain them, but allows them &s;ometimes to drop wherever &s;he happens to &s;it; and as the male &s;eems in this &s;pecies, or at lea&s;t in &s;ome
<PB N="373" REF="393">
families of this &s;pecies, as in the gray &s;ort, to &s;hare in the education of the young, it is not impro|bable but he al&s;o participates in the drudgery of incubation, and may cover a part of the eggs which were not under the hen.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle &s;ays, 3dly, That the males tread one another, and even their young as &s;oon as they are able to walk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. ix. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>; and this a&s;&s;ertion has been con&s;idered as fabulous and ab&s;urd. I have how|ever more than once had occa&s;ion to mention undoubted in&s;tances of this perver&s;ion of in|&s;tinct; and, among the Partridges, nature is &s;o purient, that the male cannot hear the cry of the female without &s;hedding <HI>&s;emen</HI>; and &s;o intoxi|cated is he with plea&s;ure in the &s;ea&s;on of love, that though commonly extremely &s;hy, he ven|tures then to alight on the bird-catcher. How much more therefore would their ardour be ex|alted in the warm climate of Greece, and when they had long been denied the company of their mates, as during the time of incubation?</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle a&s;&s;erts, 4thly, That female Partridges conceive and produce eggs, when they happen to be fanned by wind from the males, or when the&s;e fly over them, or even when they hear their notes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. v. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>. The&s;e words of the Grecian phi|lo&s;opher have given occa&s;ion to much ridicule; as if a current of air impregnated with the foecun|dating particles of the male, or the mere vibra|tion
<PB N="374" REF="394">
impre&s;&s;ed by his voice, were really &s;ufficient to impregnate the female. All that is in&s;inuated is, that in &s;uch circum&s;tances the natural fire of their con&s;titution blazes with new force; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, weltering in the du&s;t for|wards the laying<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle adds a fact which evinces their &s;alacious temperament; <Q REND="inline">they al&s;o lay <HI>zephyrian</HI> or addle eggs, if the genital parts be &s;troked by the finger.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts it is ea&s;y to conceive, that the Hen Partridge, though &s;trongly &s;et on co|vering, will &s;ometimes prefer the indulgence of appetite to the tedious duty of incubation. It may even happen that, when &s;he perceives her mate wavering in his fidelity, and about to yield to the allurements of other females, &s;he will offer the embrace, to &s;ecure the dome&s;tic har|mony, and provide for the pro&s;perity of the ex|pected progeny<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Often the female ri&s;es from her ne&s;t when &s;he perceives her mate attending to a &s;auntering female, and throwing her&s;elf into his embrace, &s;atiates his appetite. <BIBL>Ari&s;t. lib. ix. 18.</BIBL>&mdash;So that lu&s;t overcomes even the attachment to their brood. <BIBL>Lib. x. 33.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Aelian has &s;aid, that the males fight always with greater ob&s;tinacy in pre&s;ence of the females; be|cau&s;e, he adds, when thus circum&s;tanced, they will rather die, than &s;hew cowardice, or appear after being vanqui&s;hed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. iv. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>. We mu&s;t here too di&s;tingui&s;h between the fact and the intention. It is certain that the &s;ight of the females adds fuel to their quarrels; not however becau&s;e it
<PB N="375" REF="395">
piques their honour, but becau&s;e it inflames their appetite for enjoyment.</P>
<P>It is thus by di&s;tingui&s;hing between actions and intentions, and rejecting crude &s;uppo&s;itions which disfigure important facts, that we can often extract the truth from relations of animals, which have &s;o much been deformed by the fictions of man, and the folly of a&s;cribing to all other beings his own character, his own feelings, and his own apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Bartavelles</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s many properties in common with the Gray Partridges, we need only remark the chief differences. Belon, who had vi&s;ited their native climate, tells us, that they are double the &s;ize of our Partridges: that they are very plentiful, and even more common than any other bird in Greece, in the Archipelago i&s;lands, and particularly on the coa&s;ts of the i&s;land of Crete (now Candia): that they call in the love &s;ea&s;on, uttering a &s;ound like that of the word <HI>chacabis</HI>; whence the Latins have undoubtedly formed the term <HI>cacabare</HI> to denote that cry; and the &s;ame analogy might perhaps have had &s;ome &s;hare in the con&s;truction of the <HI>cubeth, cubata, cubeji,</HI> &amp;c. the names of the Red Partridge in the ea&s;tern languages.</P>
<P>Belon relates al&s;o, that the <HI>Bartavelles</HI> generally lodge in rocks, but that they come down into the plains to build their ne&s;t, in order that their young may procure food with ea&s;e: that they lay from eight to &s;ixteen eggs, of the &s;ize of &s;mall
<PB N="376" REF="396">
hen eggs, white and &s;prinkled with reddi&s;h points, and the yolk of which cannot be made hard. La&s;tly, what he imagines &s;hews the Greek Partridge to be of a different kind from our Red Partridge, is this, that in Italy, where both are known, they have each a di&s;tinct name, the Grecian &s;ort being called <HI>Cothurno,</HI> and the other <HI>Perdice</HI>; as if the vulgar who be&s;tow names could not be mi&s;taken, or even apply two different denominations to the &s;ame &s;pecies. He con|jectures al&s;o, and not without probability, that it is this large Partridge, which, according to Ari&s;totle, cro&s;&s;es with the ordinary hen and breeds prolific hybrids; a circum&s;tance which, as the Greek philo&s;opher remarks, rarely happens, and never but between the mo&s;t &s;alacious kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Generatione Animalium,</HI> lib. ii. 4.</BIBL></NOTE>. It bears &s;till another analogy to the common hen, that it &s;its on other eggs when robbed of its own:&mdash;This ob&s;ervation is very ancient, for it occurs in &s;cripture<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">As the Partridge gathereth the young which &s;he has not brought forth; &s;o he that getteth riches, and not by right, &s;hall leave them in the middle of his days, and in the end be a fool.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves, that the male Partridges &s;ing or cry chiefly in the love &s;ea&s;on, when they fight with each other, or even before they begin to quarrel<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. iv. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>The Red Partridges &s;ettle in mountains which abound with heath and bu&s;hes, and &s;ometimes in the &s;ame mountains which are inhabited by the game improperly termed <HI>White Partridges</HI>; yet they prefer the lower and more ho&s;pitable tracts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stump&s;ius <HI>apud Ge&s;n.</HI></NOTE>. In winter, they confine the range of their excur&s;ions, and lodge under the &s;helter of rocks with a &s;outhern a&s;pect. During the re&s;t of the year they continue in the bu&s;hes, and the &s;port&s;men can hardly drive them from their re|treats. I am well informed that they can, better than the common Partridge, &s;upport the rigours of winter, and are much more ea&s;ily caught by gins or &s;nares. They re&s;ort every &s;pring in nearly the &s;ame numbers to their favourite haunts. They feed on grain, herbs, &s;lugs, caterpillars, ants' eggs, and other in&s;ects; but their fle&s;h is often tainted with the &s;mell of their aliments. Aelian relates that the Partridge of Cyrrha, a maritime town in Phocis, had a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, becau&s;e of their living on garlick.</P>
<P>They fly heavily and laboriou&s;ly, like the gray &s;ort; and without &s;eeing them, we may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h them by the noi&s;e merely which they make with their wings when they are flu&s;hed. When they are &s;urpri&s;ed on the moun|tains, they &s;eek &s;helter among the precipices, and
<PB N="380" REF="401">
when they are di&s;lodged, they regain the &s;ummit. In the plains, they &s;hoot &s;wiftly forward. When they are hotly pur&s;ued, they fly into the woods, and perch upon the trees, and &s;ometimes even burrow in the ground, which the Gray Par|tridge never does.</P>
<P>The Red Partridges are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Gray al&s;o by their natural habits and di&s;po|&s;itions; they are not &s;o &s;ocial: they form them|&s;elves indeed into coveys, but the union is not &s;o complete or harmonious.

<P>Ours &s;eems to differ from the&s;e three la&s;t, and even from that of Bri&s;&s;on, not only in the colour of its plumage, and even of its bill, but by the &s;ize and form of its tail, which is longer in Bri&s;|&s;on's figure, more &s;pread in ours, and hanging in tho&s;e of Edwards and Olina. But notwith|&s;tanding this, I believe that the Francolin of Olina, that of Tournefort, that of Edwards, that of Bri&s;&s;on, and my own, are all of the &s;ame &s;pecies; &s;ince they have many common pro|perties, and their &s;mall differences are not &s;uffi|cient to con&s;titute different races, but may be referred to the age, the &s;ex, the climate, and other local or accidental circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Francolin is undoubtedly, in many re|&s;pects, like the Partridges, and for this rea|&s;on, Olina, Linnaeus, and Bri&s;&s;on, have ranged it with them. For my own part, I am con|vinced, from a clo&s;e examination and compari|&s;on of the&s;e two birds, that they ought to be &s;eparated: for the Francolin differs from the Partridge not only in the colours of its plumage, its general &s;hape, the figure of its tail, and its cry; but is di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o by a &s;pur on each leg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of Olina had none; but it was probably a female.</NOTE>; whereas the male Partridge has only a callous tubercule.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="407">
The Francolin is al&s;o much le&s;s diffu&s;ed than the Partridge; it can hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t but in the warm climates.

In all the&s;e places, both Fran|colins and Partridges occur; but they have each their appropriated name, and form di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>As the&s;e birds are very rare in Europe, and their fle&s;h is excellent food, the killing them has been forbidden in many countries under &s;evere penalties; and hence, it is &s;aid, they derive the name <HI>Francolin</HI>; becau&s;e they enjoy a &s;ort of freedom under the protection of the&s;e pro|hibitions.</P>
<P>Little more can be &s;aid of this bird than what the figure &s;ugge&s;ts: its plumage is very beautiful; it has a con&s;picuous collar of an orange colour. It is rather larger than the Common Partridge; the female is &s;maller than the male; the colours of its plumage fainter and le&s;s variegated.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds feed on grain; and they may be bred in aviaries, though care mu&s;t be taken to give each a &s;mall &s;eparate crib, where it may

<P>Linnaeus takes the Dama&s;cus Partridge of Willughby for the Francolin<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tenth edition of the <BIBL><HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. But we may ob&s;erve, 1&s;t, That this Dama&s;cus Partridge is rather Belon's, who fir&s;t took notice of it, and whom Willughby only copied. 2dly, This bird differs from the Francolin, both in the &s;ize, which is inferior to that of the Common Par|tridge, according to Belon; and in its plumage, as will ea&s;ily be perceived by comparing the figures; and be&s;ides, its legs are feathered, which prevented Belon from cla&s;&s;ing it with the plovers. Linnaeus &s;hould al&s;o have admitted the Francolin of Tournefort as the &s;ame with that of Olina, which Willughby mentions. La&s;tly, the Swedi&s;h naturali&s;t is mi&s;taken in fix|ing exclu&s;ively on the Ea&s;t as the climate of the Francolin; for, as I have already ob&s;erved, it is found in Sicily, Italy, Spain, and Barbary, and in many other countries to which the epithet of oriental cannot be applied.</P>

di&s;po|&s;itions are not &s;o gentle; it is extremely rare to &s;ee them
tamed, and though confined from their infancy, they can hardly be trained to
obey the voice. They are not of &s;uch a &s;ocial temper; for they &s;eldom
form them&s;elves into coveys, except when their wants unite the feeble family
to their mother, or &s;ome common and powerful cau&s;e urges at once the whole
&s;pecies <PB N="398" REF="420"> to a&s;&s;emble together, and traver&s;e the
extent of the ocean, holding their cour&s;e to the &s;ame di&s;tant land. But
this forced a&s;&s;o|ciation &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no longer than nece&s;&s;ity
re|quires; and after they have alighted, and find in their adopted country that
they can live at will, their union di&s;&s;olves. The appetite of love is the
only tie that binds them together, and even this connection is un&s;table and
mo|mentary; for though the male &s;eeks the female with the greate&s;t ardour,
he di&s;covers no choice or predilection; the matches are formed ha&s;tily, and
as quickly broken. As &s;oon as pa&s;&s;ion has &s;pent its force, the male
treats his mate with in|difference and cruelty, and abandons her to the labour
and care of rai&s;ing the family. The young are hardly grown up when they
&s;eparate, or if they are kept together, they fight ob&s;ti|nately with each
other; their quarrels are ter|minated only by their mutual de&s;truction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancients were well acquainted with this fact, for they &s;aid

<P>The propen&s;ity of the Quails to migrate at certain &s;ea&s;ons, is one of their mo&s;t powerful in&s;tincts.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this de&s;ire mu&s;t be very gene|ral, for it acts not only on the whole &s;pecies, but al&s;o on individuals kept in confinement and debarred from communication with their kind. Some young Quails, bred in cages from their
<PB N="399" REF="421">
earlie&s;t infancy, which had never enjoyed liberty, and therefore could not feel its lo&s;s, were yet ob&s;erved, for the &s;pace of four years, to &s;hew a degree of re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and to flutter with unu&s;ual agitations, regularly at the &s;ea&s;on of migration, which returns twice annually, in April and in September. This unea&s;ine&s;s la&s;ted thirty days each time, and began con&s;tantly an hour before &s;un-ri&s;e. The pri&s;oners moved backward and forward from one end of the cage to the other, and darted again&s;t the net which covered it, and often with &s;uch violence, that they dropped down &s;tunned by the blow. They pa&s;&s;ed the night in the&s;e fruitle&s;s &s;truggles, and the following day they appeared dejected, exhau&s;ted, and torpid. We know al&s;o that, in the &s;tate of liberty, Quails &s;leep the greater part of the day: and if to this we add, that they are &s;eldom ob&s;erved to arrive in the day-time, we may infer, that they perform their journies by night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon and Pliny expre&s;s the &s;ame opinion.</NOTE>, and that the di&s;po&s;ition to migrate is innate: whether that avoiding the extremes of heat and cold, they remove to the north in &s;ummer, and advance to the &s;outh in winter; or what is more probable, that they direct their cour&s;e to tho&s;e countries where the harve&s;t is making, and thus change their abode to pro|cure the proper &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves and for their young.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="422">
This la&s;t rea&s;on, I &s;ay, is the mo&s;t probable; for, on the one hand, it is proved by experi|ence, that Quails can well &s;upport cold; &s;ince Horrebow informs us that they have been found in Iceland; and they have been kept for years together in a room without fire, and having even a northern a&s;pect, and yet &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t affected by the &s;evere&s;t winters. On the other hand, it appears, that one circum|&s;tance which determines them to abide in a country, is the plenty of herbage; for it is well known by &s;port&s;men, that when the &s;pring is dry, and con&s;equently gra&s;s &s;carce, there are few Quails the re&s;t of the year. Be&s;ides, the &s;pur of actual want is a more powerful cau&s;e, is more con&s;i&s;tent with the limited in&s;tinct of the&s;e ani|mals, and implies le&s;s fore&s;ight, which philo&s;o|phers have rather been too liberal in be&s;towing on brutes. When they cannot procure &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence in one country, it is very natural to &s;uppo&s;e that they will &s;eek it in another. This &s;carcity of food intimates to them their &s;itua|tion, and rou&s;es all their faculties into action. They leave the exhau&s;ted tract, ri&s;e into the regions of air, and pu&s;h forward to di&s;cover countries which may pre&s;ent them with abund|ance. Habit joining it&s;elf to the in&s;tinct com|mon to all animals, but mo&s;t remarkable in the winged tribes, of &s;centing their food from a
<PB N="401" REF="423">
di&s;tance, gives birth to a di&s;po&s;ition which is as it were innate; it is not therefore &s;urpri&s;ing that the &s;ame Quails &s;hould return annually to the &s;ame haunts. But we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e with Ari&s;totle, that it is from an attentive ob|&s;ervation of the &s;ea&s;ons, and that they change their climate twice a-year, like the ancient kings of Per&s;ia. It will be &s;till more difficult to ad|mit, with Cate&s;by and Belon, and &s;ome others, that when they &s;hift their re&s;idence, they wing their cour&s;e without interruption to the Anti|podes, there to find exactly the &s;ame latitude, and to enjoy the &s;ame temperature; which would imply &s;cientific knowledge, or rather error, to which brute in&s;tinct is much le&s;s &s;ub|ject than cultivated rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But whatever &s;peculations we may form with re&s;pect to the migration of the Quails, certain it is, that when they enjoy their natural liberty they depart and return at &s;tated times. They left Greece according to Ari&s;totle, in the month <HI>Boedromion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t.

April. Olina fixes the time of their arrival in the <HI>Campagna di Roma</HI> in the beginning of April. But almo&s;t all agree that they depart after the fir&s;t autumnal fro&s;t, which &s;poils the gra&s;s and de&s;troys the in&s;ects; and &s;ince the colds of May do not drive them back to the &s;outh, we are furni&s;hed with another proof that warmth is not what they &s;eek, but that their real object is food, and of which the &s;pring fro&s;ts cannot deprive them. We mu&s;t not however con&s;ider the&s;e terms as invariably fixed. They will vary within certain limits in different coun|tries according to the nature of the climate; and even in the &s;ame region, they will be affected by the latene&s;s or earline&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, which will advance or retard the harve&s;t, and will promote or check the multiplication of the in&s;ects which &s;upport the Quails.</P>
<P>Both the ancients and the moderns have been bu&s;y in forming theories with regard to the migration of the Quail and other birds of pa&s;&s;age; &s;ome have heightened it by the addition of the marvellous; while others, &s;truck with the difficulty of conceiving that &s;o &s;mall a bird, and which flies tardily and laboriou&s;ly, could perform di&s;tant journies, have he&s;itated to ad|mit the fact, and have had recour&s;e to hypothe&s;es &s;till more extraordinary to account for their re|gular di&s;appearance at certain &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons. None of the ancients ever entertained indeed the &s;lighte&s;t doubt on the &s;ubject: and yet they
<PB N="403" REF="425">
well knew that the Quail is inactive, flies little and with reluctance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. viii. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>; and that though ex|tremely ardent in its pa&s;&s;ions, it employs not its wings to tran&s;port it&s;elf to the invitation of the female, but often travels more than a quarter of a league through the clo&s;e&s;t herbage to meet her, and never ri&s;es into the air except when clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by dogs or hunters: with all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, the ancients were acquainted; but they never dreamt that, on the approach of the cold &s;ea&s;on, the&s;e birds crept into holes to re|main in a dormant &s;tate during the winter, like the dormice, the hedge-hogs, the marmots, the bats, &amp;c. This ab&s;urdity was re&s;erved for &s;ome moderns, who certainly did not know that the internal heat of animals &s;ubject to become torpid, being generally inferior to that of other qua|drupeds, and &s;till more to that of birds, requires a con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ion of warmth from the air, as I have &s;hewn in another work: when this &s;ource fails, the vital action is &s;u&s;pended; and, if they were expo&s;ed to a greater cold, they would in a &s;hort time peri&s;h. But this certainly is not ap|plicable to the Quails, which are generally e&s;teemed of a hotter con&s;titution than the other birds; &s;o that in France it has given ri&s;e to a proverb<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is a common &s;aying, <HI>Chaud comme un Caille,</HI> warm as a Quail.</NOTE>; and in China, it is cu&s;tomary to carry this bird alive in one's hands to keep them

warm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>O&s;born's Travels.</BIBL></NOTE>. Be&s;ides, I have di&s;covered from ob&s;er|vations continued for &s;everal years, that they never grow torpid, though &s;hut during the whole winter in rooms without a fire, and expo&s;ed to the north, as I have formerly mentioned: and many per&s;ons of the mo&s;t undoubted veracity, who had &s;imilar opportunities, have a&s;&s;ured me of the &s;ame fact. But, if the Quails neither conceal them&s;elves nor remain torpid through the winter, and always di&s;appear in that &s;ea&s;on, we may certainly conclude that they migrate into other countries.&mdash;And this fact is demon&s;trat|ed by a great number of other authorities.</P>
<P>Belon, happening in autumn to be on board a ve&s;&s;el, in his pa&s;&s;age from Rhodes to Alexandria, &s;aw Quails flying from the north towards the &s;outh.

<PB N="405" REF="427">
that they have often, in the fine nights during &s;pring, heard them arrive, and could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h their cry, though at a great height in the air.

Almo&s;t all tho&s;e of the Archipelago and even the &s;helves, are, according to Tournefort, covered with them, in certain times of the year; and more than one of tho&s;e i&s;lands has been named <HI>Ortygia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which &s;ignifies a Quail.

<P>But it will &s;till be replied, how can a bird &s;o &s;mall, &s;o weak, who&s;e flight is &s;o &s;low and labo|rious, how can it, though urged by hunger, tra|ver&s;e the great extent of &s;ea?

<P>M.

<P>Sailors whom I have con&s;ulted on this &s;ub|ject inform me, that when the Quails are &s;ur|pri&s;ed in their pa&s;&s;age by a contrary wind, they alight on the neare&s;t ve&s;&s;els, as Pliny has re|marked<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">They arrive not without danger to navigators who have ap|proached near the land; for they alight on the &s;ails, and this al|ways at night, and &s;ink the ve&s;&s;els.</Q> <BIBL>PLINY <HI>Hi&s;t.

them one after another, when they have cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea. This is nothing
more than bits of gravel which the Quails, like other granivorous birds,
&s;wallow with their food. In general, &s;uch a degree of de&s;ign, &s;agacity,
and di&s;cernment, is a&s;cribed to them, as would <PB N="409" REF="431"> give
room to doubt if tho&s;e who are &s;o liberal in be&s;towing the&s;e qualities,
really po&s;&s;e&s;s a large &s;hare them&s;elves. They have remark|ed that
other migratory birds, as the Land Rail, accompany the Quails, and that the
Falcon was &s;ure to catch &s;ome one on its arrival; hence they have concluded
that the Quails choo&s;e out from another &s;pecies a guide or chief, which
they call <HI>The King of the Quails (ortygrometra)</HI>; for as the foremo&s;t
of the body falls a victim to the hawk, the Quails &s;hrewdly contrive to
ca&s;t the danger upon the fated individual of a foreign race.</P>
<P>But the Quails do not all migrate; there are a few which, being unable to follow the re&s;t, remain behind; either having received a wound in their wings, or, being the product of the &s;econd hatch, they are too young and feeble to perform the journey. The&s;e &s;tragglers &s;eek to find a proper &s;ituation in the country where they are obliged to abide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aldrovandus, lib. viii. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. In France the number of the&s;e is very incon&s;iderable; but the Author of the Briti&s;h Zoology a&s;&s;ures us, that in Eng|land a part only of the Quails are ob&s;erved to quit the i&s;land entirely, while tho&s;e which re|main &s;hift their quarters, removing from the in|terior counties to the &s;ea coa&s;t, and particularly to the hundreds of E&s;&s;ex, where they continue through the winter: if the fro&s;t or &s;now drive
<PB N="410" REF="432">
them from the &s;tubble fields or mar&s;hes, they retreat to the beach, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the marine plants, which they can pick up between high and low water mark. The &s;ame Author &s;ub|joins, that the time of their appearance in E&s;&s;ex corre&s;ponds exactly to that of their leaving the inland country. It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that a great number of them remain in Spain and in the &s;outh of Italy, when the winter is not &s;o &s;evere as entirely to de&s;troy the &s;eeds and in&s;ects that &s;erve for their food.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;uch as venture to cro&s;s the &s;eas, tho&s;e only perform a fortunate voyage that are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a fair wind; and if in the pre|ceding &s;ea&s;on it has &s;eldom blown from a favour|able quarter, much fewer arrive in the countries where they &s;pend their &s;ummer. And, in ge|neral, we may judge with tolerable accuracy of the place whence they have come, by the direc|tion of the breeze which wafts them along.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Quails arrive, they &s;et about lay|ing. They do not pair, as I have already re|marked; and if the number of males, as I am informed, exceeds much that of the females, monogamy would have been inconvenient. Fide|lity, confidence, per&s;onal attachment, qualities &s;o de&s;irable in the individual, would have been hurtful in the &s;pecies. The multitude of males reduced to a &s;tate of celibacy, would di&s;turb the marriages that are formed, and render them un|prolific.
<PB N="411" REF="433">
But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the unbounded liberty of union blunts and extingui&s;hes the jealou&s;y and the rival&s;hip of their loves. The male has been ob&s;erved to repeat a dozen times a-day his embraces with &s;everal females in|di&s;criminately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus and Schwenckfeld,</NOTE>; and while nature tolerates this kind of libertini&s;m, &s;he provides for the mul|tiplication of the &s;pecies. Each female drops fifteen or twenty eggs into a ne&s;t, which &s;he hollows in the ground with her claws, lines with gra&s;s and leaves, and conceals as much as po&s;|&s;ible from the piercing eye of the hawks. The&s;e eggs are greyi&s;h, &s;peckled with brown. She &s;its about three weeks. The ardor of the males effectually fecundates them, and they are &s;eldom found addle.</P>
<P>The Authors of the Briti&s;h Zoology &s;ay, that in England the Quails &s;eldom lay more than &s;ix or &s;even eggs. If this fact be uniform, we may conclude that they are le&s;s prolific in that i&s;land than in France, Italy, &amp;c.; and it remains to be inquired whether this diminution of the genial powers ought to be attributed to the cold, or &s;ome other quality of the climate.</P>
<P>The young Quails are able to run almo&s;t as &s;oon as they leave the &s;hell, like the young Par|tridges; but they are in many re&s;pects more hardy, &s;ince in the &s;tate of liberty they quit their mother much earlier, and even venture to de|pend

The Quail, like the Partridge and many other animals, never multiplies its kind, except when it enjoys the liberty of nature. In vain have the forlorn pri&s;oners been furni&s;hed with the ma|terials for con&s;tructing their ne&s;ts; the tendere&s;t concerns are &s;tifled in their brea&s;t, and their eggs are allowed to drop unheeded.</P>
<P>Many fooli&s;h &s;tories have been told with re|&s;pect to the generation of Quails.

It has been alleged that they are bred from the tunnies, which the troubled ocean &s;ometimes ca&s;ts on the &s;hores of Lybia; that they appear at fir&s;t like worms, then a&s;&s;ume the form of flies, and gradually growing larger, they become gra&s;shoppers, and at la&s;t Quails<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>: that is, the vulgar &s;eeing the Quails &s;earching among the carca&s;es of the tunnies rejected by the waves for &s;ome in&s;ects that are hatched in them, and having &s;ome vague idea of the metamorpho&s;es which in&s;ects undergo, fancied that a gra&s;shopper could be transformed into a Quail, as a worm is changed into a fly. La&s;tly, it has been &s;aid, that the male copulates with the female toad<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phanodemus <HI>apud Ge&s;nerum.</HI></NOTE>; a &s;tory which has not even the &s;lighte&s;t appear|ance of probability.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="439">
The Quails feed on wheat, millet, hemp-&s;eed, green herbage, in&s;ects, and all &s;orts of &s;eed, even that of the hellebore; which gave the antients an antipathy to its fle&s;h, augmented &s;till further by the reflection that the&s;e were the only animals be&s;ides man that are &s;ubject to the epilep&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pliny, lib. x. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. But experience has de&s;troyed this prejudice.</P>
<P>In Holland, where the&s;e birds are frequent, e&s;pecially along the coa&s;ts, it is u&s;ual to call the berries of Bryony Quail-berries; which &s;hews that they prefer that &s;ort of food<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hadrian. Jun. <HI>Nomenclat.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It would appear that they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without drink; for &s;port&s;men have a&s;&s;ured me, that they are never ob&s;erved to &s;eek water; and others, that they have fed them a whole year on dry grain without any drink, though they frequently drank when it was in their power. To with|draw every kind of drink, is even the only way to cure them when they <HI>ca&s;t out their water</HI>; that is, when they are attacked by a certain di&s;|temper, in which they have always a drop at the point of their bill.</P>
<P>Some have imagined, that they always trouble the water before they drink, and they have not failed to a&s;cribe it to envy; for naturali&s;ts are never &s;atisfied till they a&s;&s;ign to brutes the mo|tives of action. They inhabit the fields, the pa&s;ture grounds, and the vineyards; but &s;eldom

re&s;ort to the woods, and never perch upon trees. They grow much fatter than Partridges. What is &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute to this, is their re|maining &s;till during the greate&s;t part of the heat of the day; then they conceal them&s;elves in the talle&s;t gra&s;s, and &s;ometimes continue in the &s;ame &s;pot for the &s;pace of four hours, lying on their &s;ide, with their legs extended; and &s;o much are they overcome with the drow&s;y indolence, that a dog mu&s;t ab&s;olutely run upon them before they are flu&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that they live only four or five years, and Olina attributes the &s;hortne&s;s of the term to their di&s;po&s;ition to corpulency. Artemidorus imputes it to their unhappy quarrel&s;ome temper; and &s;uch is really their character, for they have been made to fight in public to entertain the rabble. Solon even directed that &s;uch combats &s;hould be exhibited to the youth, with the view to inflame their courage. And this &s;pecies of gymna&s;tic exerci&s;e, which would appear to us &s;o puerile, mu&s;t have been held in high e&s;timation by the Romans, and con&s;idered as an affair of the &s;tate, &s;ince we are told that Augu&s;tus puni&s;h|ed a prefect of Egypt with death, for buying and bringing to table one of the&s;e birds that had acquired celebrity by its victories.

At fir&s;t they &s;hew a threatening a&s;pect, and then ru&s;h on like light|ning, &s;trike with their bills, erecting the head and ri&s;ing upon their &s;purs, and fight till one yields the field of battle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. Formerly, the&s;e combats were performed between a Quail and a man: the Quail was put into a large box, and &s;et in the middle of a circle traced on the floor; the man &s;truck it on the head with one finger, or plucked &s;ome feathers from it: if the Quail, in defending it&s;elf, did not pa&s;s the limits of the circle, its ma&s;ter gained the wager; but if in its fury it tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds, its worthy antagoni&s;t was declared victor; and &s;uch Quails as often won the prize &s;old very dear<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Julius Pollux <HI>de Ludis,</HI> lib. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>Since the Quail is accu&s;tomed to migrate, and travels to immen&s;e di&s;tances by the aid of the wind, it is ea&s;y to conceive that it mu&s;t be &s;pread through a wide extent.

<P>THE Colins are Mexican birds, which have rather been mentioned than de&s;cribed by Fernandez<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;toria Avium Novae Hi&s;paniae,</HI> cap. xxiv, xxv. xxxix. lxxxv. and cxxxiv.</BIBL></NOTE>; and tho&s;e who have copied that author on this &s;ubject have committed &s;ome mi&s;takes, which it will be proper to correct.</P>

Nirembergi Hi&s;toria Naturae maxime Peregrinae,</HI> lib. x. cap. lxxii. p. 232.</BIBL></NOTE>, who profe&s;&s;es to take his accounts entirely from others, and who in this place borrows from Fernandez, takes no notice of the <HI>Cacacolin</HI> of chap. cxxxiv. though that bird is of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the Colins.</P>
<P>Secondly, Fernandez &s;peaks of two <HI>Acolins,</HI> or Water-Quails, in chap. x. and cxxxi.; Nie|remberg mentions the former, and very improper|ly, after the Colins; &s;ince it is a water-bird, as well as the one of chap. cxxxi. which he totally omits.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="451">
Thirdly, He takes notice of the <HI>Occolin</HI> of chap. lxxxv. of Fernandez, which is a Mexican Partridge, and con&s;equently nearly related to the Colins, which are al&s;o Partridges, as we &s;hall &s;ee.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Ray &s;till copying Nieremberg, on the &s;ubject of the <HI>Coyolcozque</HI> varies the expre&s;&s;ion, and in my opinion alters the meaning of the pa&s;&s;age; for Nieremberg &s;ays, that this Coyol|cozque is like the Quails &s;o called by us <HI>Spaniards,</HI> (which are certainly the Colins,) and concludes with telling that this is a &s;pecies of the Spani&s;h Partridge. But Ray makes him &s;ay that it is like the European Quails, and &s;uppre&s;&s;es the words <HI>e&s;t enim &s;pecies perdicis Hi&s;panicae</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>For it is a &s;pecies of Spani&s;h Partridge.</HI></NOTE>; yet the&s;e la&s;t words are e&s;&s;ential, and contain the real notion of Fernandez with regard to the &s;pecies to which the&s;e birds mu&s;t be referred; &s;ince, in chap. xxxix. which is occupied entirely on the Colins, he &s;ays that the Spaniards call them <HI>Quails,</HI> becau&s;e they re&s;emble the European Quails, though they certainly belong to the genus of Partridges. It is true, that he repeats in the &s;ame chapter, that all the Colins are referred to the Quails; but, in &s;pite of this confu&s;ion, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that when the author be&s;tows on the Colins the name of <HI>Quails,</HI> he &s;peaks after the vulgar, who are guided in applying epithets by the general appearances, and that his more ac|curate
<PB N="428" REF="452">
opinion was, that they are &s;pecies of the Partridge. I &s;hould therefore have had rea&s;on, from the authority of Fernandez, the only ob|&s;erver who has had an opportunity of viewing the&s;e birds, to place the Colins next the Par|tridges; but I have rather cho&s;en to yield as much as po&s;&s;ible to the common opinion, which is not altogether groundle&s;s, of ranging them after the Quails, as being related to both the&s;e kinds of birds.</P>
<P>According to Fernandez, the Colins are very common in New Spain; their mu&s;ic re&s;embles much that of our Quails; their fle&s;h is excellent, and proper even for &s;ick people when kept &s;ome days. They feed on grain, and are commonly kept in a cage; which would make one believe that they are different from our Quails, and even our Partridges.&mdash;We &s;hall in the following articles take notice of their &s;everal kinds.</P>

the Wood Grous in its bill, legs, and general form; its legs however are not feathered, nor are its toes edged with indentings, nor its eyes decorated with red orbits, as we may &s;ee from the figure. Bri&s;&s;on, who conceives this bird to be the &s;ame with the <HI>Colenicuiltic</HI> of Fernandez, has ranged it among the Quails, by the name of <HI>Loui&s;iana Quail,</HI> and gives a figure of it. But comparing the figures or the de&s;criptions of Bri&s;&s;on, Fri&s;ch, and Fernandez, I find greater differences than could occur in the &s;ame bird; for not to mention the colours of the plumage, &s;o difficult to paint in de&s;cription, and &s;till le&s;s the attitude, which is but too arbitrary, I ob&s;erve that the bill and the legs are large and yellowi&s;h, according to Fri&s;ch; red and moderate &s;ized, according to Bri&s;&s;on; and that the legs are blue, according to Fer|nandez.</P>
<P>But if I attend to the different lights in which naturali&s;ts have viewed it, the embarra&s;&s;ment will be increa&s;ed; for Fri&s;ch fancied that it was a Hen of the Wood, Bri&s;&s;on a Quail, and Fernan|dez a Partridge. That this was the opinion of the la&s;t manife&s;tly appears, for though he &s;ays, in the beginning of chap. xxv. that it is a Quail, he evidently conforms to the common language; &s;ince he concludes the chapter with &s;aying, that the <HI>Colenicuiltic,</HI> in its bulk, in its cry, in its habits, and in every other particular, is analogous to the bird of chap. xxiv; but that bird is the Coyolcozque, a kind of Colin; and Fernandez,

<P>IT was ea&s;y to dome&s;ticate the heavy and in|active birds, &s;uch as the common hen, the turkey, and the peacock; but to tame tho&s;e which are nimble and &s;hoot on rapid wings, required attention and art. A low hut, rudely con&s;tructed on a confined &s;pot, is &s;ufficient for lodging and rai&s;ing our poultry; to induce the Pigeons to &s;ettle, we mu&s;t erect a lofty building, well co|vered without and fitted up with numerous cells. They really are not dome&s;tics, like dogs or hor&s;es; or pri&s;oners like the fowls; they are rather voluntary captives, tran&s;ient gue&s;ts, who continue to re&s;ide in the dwelling a&s;&s;igned them, only becau&s;e they like it, and are plea&s;ed with a &s;ituation which affords them abundance of food, and all the conveniencies and comforts of life. On the &s;lighte&s;t di&s;appointment or di&s;gu&s;t, they abandon their man&s;ion, and di&s;per&s;e; and &s;ome of them even will always prefer the mouldering holes of ancient walls to the neate&s;t apartments in Pigeon-hou&s;es; others take their abode in the clefts and hollows of trees; others &s;eem to fly the habitations of men, and cannot be pre|vailed to enter their precincts; others again never

roam from human dwellings, but mu&s;t be fed near their volery, to which they are inflexibly at|tached. The&s;e various and even oppo&s;ite habits &s;hew, that under the Pigeon are included many different &s;pecies. This opinion is confirmed by the modern nomenclators, who, be&s;ides a great number of varieties, reckon five &s;pecies of Pigeons, without including the Ring-dove and Turtle. We &s;hall remove the&s;e two la&s;t &s;pecies from tho&s;e of the Pigeon, and con&s;ider each &s;eparately.</P>
<P>The five &s;pecies of Pigeons noticed by our no|menclators are, 1. The Dome&s;tic Pigeon; 2. The Roman Pigeon, which includes &s;ixteen varieties; 3. The Brown Pigeon; 4. The Rock Pigeon, with one variety; 5. The Wild Pigeon; but the&s;e five &s;pecies are in my opinion the &s;ame. My rea&s;on is this. The Dome&s;tic Pigeon and the Roman Pigeon, with all their varieties, though differing in &s;ize and colours, are certainly the &s;ame &s;pecies; &s;ince they breed together, and their progeny are capable of procreating. We can|not con&s;ider the great and little Dome&s;tic Pigeons as two different &s;pecies; we can only &s;ay that they are different branches of the &s;ame kind, the one of which has been reduced to a more per|fect dome&s;tication than the other. In the &s;ame manner, the Brown Pigeon, the Rock Pigeon, and the Wild Pigeon, are three nominal &s;pecies which may be compri&s;ed in one, which is the Brown Pigeon, and of which the Rock Pigeon and the Wild Pigeon are only minute varieties;
<PB N="437" REF="461">
&s;ince the nomenclators them&s;elves admit that the&s;e three are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, that they migrate, perch, and have all the &s;ame in&s;tincts, differing only in their &s;hades of colour.</P>
<P>Thus the five nominal &s;pecies are compri&s;ed under two; viz. the Brown Pigeon and the Common Pigeon; and in the&s;e no real difference exi&s;ts, except that the fir&s;t is wild, and the &s;econd dome&s;tic. I con&s;ider the Brown Pigeon as the parent of all the re&s;t, and from which they differ more or le&s;s according as they have been handled by men. Though I cannot prove it, I am con|fident that the Stock Pigeon and the Common Pigeon would breed together if they were paired: for the difference is not &s;o great be|tween our little Dome&s;tic Pigeon and the Stock Pigeon, as between it and the large rough-footed or Roman Pigeon, with which however it breeds. Be&s;ides, in this &s;pecies we can trace all the gradations between the wild and the dome&s;tic &s;tate, as they occur in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; in the order of genealogy, or rather of degeneracy. The Stock Pigeon is imitated, in a way that cannot be mi&s;|under&s;tood, by tho&s;e de&s;erters which leave our pigeon-hou&s;es; they perch on trees, which is the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t &s;hade in their return to the &s;tate of nature: the&s;e Pigeons, though bred do|me&s;tics, and apparently reconciled, like the re&s;t, to a fixed abode and to common habits, abandon their dwelling, renounce &s;ociety, and &s;eek a &s;et|tlement in the woods; and thus, impelled by in|&s;tinct
<PB N="438" REF="462">
alone, they re&s;ume their native manners. Others, &s;eemingly le&s;s courageous and le&s;s intre|pid, but equally fond of liberty, fly from our pigeon-hou&s;es, and &s;eek a &s;olitary lodgment in the holes of old walls, or, forming a &s;mall body, they haunt &s;ome unfrequented towers; and in &s;pite of the hard&s;hips to which their &s;ituation expo&s;es them, and the multiplied dangers that a&s;&s;ail them from all &s;ides, they &s;till prefer the&s;e uncomfort|able dwellings to the convenience and plenty of their former man&s;ion: this is the &s;econd grada|tion to the &s;tate of nature. The Wall Pigeons do not completely adopt their native habits, and do not perch like the former, yet they enjoy a much larger &s;hare of freedom than tho&s;e which remain in the dome&s;tic condition. The third gradation is the inhabitants of our pigeon-hou&s;es, which never leave their dwelling but to &s;ettle in one more comfortable, and which roam abroad only to &s;eek amu&s;ement, or to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. And as even among the&s;e there are &s;ome de&s;erters, it would &s;eem that the traces of their primaeval in&s;tincts are not entirely effaced. The fourth and fifth gradations have totally changed their nature. Their tribes, varieties, and inter|mixtures are innumerable, being completely do|me&s;tic from the earlie&s;t ages; and man, while he has improved their external forms, has changed their internal qualities, and extingui&s;hed in them every &s;entiment of freedom. The&s;e birds are for the mo&s;t part larger and more beautiful than
<PB N="439" REF="463">
the Common Pigeons; are more prolific, fatter and finer flavoured, and on all the&s;e accounts more pains have been be&s;towed upon them. They are inactive helple&s;s creatures, that require the con&s;tant attention of man; and the mo&s;t cruel hunger cannot in them call forth tho&s;e little arts in which animals are u&s;ually &s;o prompt. They are therefore completely dome&s;ticated, and entirely dependent on man, who has degraded them from their original condition.</P>
<P>If we &s;uppo&s;e, that after our dove-cots were &s;tocked, we &s;elected tho&s;e of the young which were mo&s;t remarkable for their beauty, and rai&s;ed them apart with greater care and attention, and &s;till continued to choo&s;e the mo&s;t gaudy of their de&s;cendants; we &s;hould at la&s;t obtain tho&s;e painted varieties which at pre&s;ent exi&s;t. To give a complete hi&s;tory of the&s;e would therefore be to detail the effects of art, rather than to de|&s;cribe the productions of nature. For this rea|&s;on, we &s;hall content our&s;elves with the bare enumeration of them.</P>

Dome&s;tic Pigeon, but of a browner colour.

We may &s;uppo&s;e that this variety has ari&s;en from tho&s;e individuals which de&s;ert our pigeon-hou&s;es, and relap&s;e into the &s;tate of nature; for the dark blue Wild Pigeons ne&s;tle not only in the clefts of trees, but in the holes of ruins and precipices which they find in the fore&s;ts.

If it has lo&s;t that na|tive courage which is founded on the feeling of independence, it has acquired more of the agree|able and u&s;eful qualities. It often hatches thrice a-year, and, if &s;till more dome&s;ticated, even ten or twelve times; whereas the Brown Pigeons breeds only once, or at mo&s;t twice, annually. They lay, at intervals of two days, almo&s;t always two eggs and &s;eldom three, and never rai&s;e more than two young, which are commonly a male and female. Many, and the&s;e are of the younger &s;ort, lay only once a-year, and the &s;pring hatch is always the mo&s;t numerous. The be&s;t pigeon-hou&s;es are tho&s;e built facing the ea&s;t, on &s;ome ri&s;ing ground &s;everal hundred paces di&s;tant from the farm-yard; where the in|habitants can enjoy quiet, have the advantage of an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, and receive the cheering influence of the morning &s;un.

alight to ba&s;k on a pigeon-hou&s;e that was &s;eated on a hill, and drive away or even di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the lodgers; and this happens oftene&s;t in &s;pring and autumn. I &s;hall add another remark, that lofty and &s;olitary pigeon-hou&s;es are the mo&s;t productive. From one of mine, I had u&s;ually 400 pairs of young Pigeons; while I got only 100 or 130 from others that were &s;ituated 200 feet lower. The only danger is, le&s;t the rapacious birds that hover about the elevated tracts di&s;turb the Pigeons and check their breeding, for they cannot much dimini&s;h their numbers, as they prey on tho&s;e only which &s;tray from the flock.</P>
<P>After the Common Pigeon, which is half do|me&s;tic, we &s;hall place tho&s;e varieties to the pro|duction of which man has &s;o much contributed; but the number is &s;o immen&s;e, that it would ex|ceed the limits of our work to de&s;cribe each particularly, and we &s;hall therefore be contented with a general &s;urvey.</P>
<P>The curious in this line apply the name of Bi&s;et to all Pigeons that live in the fields, or are bred in large pigeon-hou&s;es, and call tho&s;e <HI>do|me&s;tic</HI> which are lodged in &s;mall pigeon-hou&s;es, or voleries, and do not venture to roam abroad.

<P N="2">2. The Painted Chamois Pouter Pigeon; the female has not that rich a&s;&s;emblage of colours.

<P N="12"><PB N="446" REF="472">
12. The Dark Pouter Pigeon of a fine vel|vet black, with ten wing-quills white, as in the Che&s;nut Pouter Pigeon. Both have the bib or kerchief under the neck white; and the females are like the males. Of all the Pouter Pigeons of a pure breed, that is, which have an uniform plumage, the ten quills are all white as far as the middle of the wing, and this may be re|garded as a general character.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Slaty Pouter Pigeon, which has the under-&s;urface of the wings white, and a white cravat; the female is like the male.&mdash;The&s;e are the principal breeds of the Pouter Pigeons, but there are others of inferior beauty, &s;uch as the red, the olive, the &s;able, &amp;c</P>
<P>All Pigeons have more or le&s;s the power of inflating their craw by in&s;piring air; and the &s;ame effect may be produced by blowing into the gullet. But this breed of Pouter Pigeons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property in &s;o &s;uperior a degree as can re&s;ult only from &s;ome peculiar conformation of its organs. The craw, almo&s;t as large as the re&s;t of the body, and kept con&s;tantly inflated, obliges them to draw back their head, and pre|vents them from looking forward: and thus while they &s;well with conceit, the falcon &s;eizes them unawares. Hence they are rai&s;ed more for curio&s;ity than utility.</P>
<P>Another breed is the Proud Pigeons; they are the mo&s;t common, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t e&s;teemed, on account of their prolific quality.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="473">
The Proud Pigeon is nearly one half larger than the Bi&s;et, and the female pretty much re|&s;embles the male. They breed almo&s;t every month in the year, provided that only a &s;mall number are put into the &s;ame volery, and to each there be allowed three or four ba&s;kets or rather holes, formed into pretty deep ca&s;ements with &s;helves, to prevent them from &s;eeing one another while &s;itting; for each Pigeon not only defends its own hole, and fights the others that come near it, but contends for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the next row. For example, eight pairs are &s;ufficient to &s;tock a &s;pace eight feet &s;quare, and people who have bred them affirm that &s;ix pair would be equally productive. The more their number be increa&s;ed in a given &s;pace, the more there will be of brawling and fighting and of broken eggs. In this breed there are often impotent males, and barren females, which never lay.</P>
<P>They are fit to breed in the eighth or ninth month, but do not attain maturity till three years old. Their prolific powers are vigorous for &s;ix or &s;even years; after which the number of eggs they lay dimini&s;hes gradually; though there are in&s;tances of their breeding at the age of twelve. They lay their two eggs &s;ometimes in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, and during winter in that of two days; &s;o that the interval varies according to the &s;ea&s;on. The female keeps her fir&s;t egg warm, without covering it a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly, nor does &s;he begin to &s;it clo&s;ely till after
<PB N="448" REF="474">
the &s;econd is laid. The period of incubation is commonly eighteen days; &s;ometimes only &s;even|teen, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, and nineteen or twenty in winter. The attachment of the fe|male to her eggs is &s;o ardent and &s;teady, that &s;he will forego every comfort, and &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t cruel hard&s;hips, rather than for&s;ake them. A Hen Pigeon, who&s;e toes froze and dropt off, per&s;i&s;ted to &s;it till her young were hatched: her toes were fro&s;t-bitten, becau&s;e her hole chanced to be clo&s;e to the window of the dove-cot.</P>
<P>While the female is employed in hatching, the male places him&s;elf in the next hole; and the moment &s;he is compelled by hunger to leave her eggs and go to the trough, he ob&s;erves her feeble murmur of intimation, takes her place, covers the eggs and &s;its two or three hours. This incu|bation of the male is commonly repeated twice in the cour&s;e of the twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>The varieties of the Proud Pigeon may be reduced to three with re&s;pect to &s;ize, which have all the common character of a red filet round the eyes.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e heavy birds that are nearly as large as &s;mall pullets; their bulk alone recommends them, for they are not good breeders.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Bagadais</HI> are large Proud Pigeons, with a tubercle over the bill in the form of a &s;mall morel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morel</HI> is a little red mu&s;hroom.</NOTE>, and a broad red ribbon round the
<PB N="449" REF="475">
eyes, that is, a &s;econd eyelid, fle&s;hy and reddi&s;h, which even falls upon the eyes when they are old, and prevents them from &s;eeing.&mdash;The&s;e Pigeons are not productive.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bagadais</HI> have a curved and hooked bill, and exhibit many varieties; white, black, red, tawny, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spani&s;h Pigeon; which is as large as a hen, and exceedingly beautiful. It differs from the <HI>Bagadais</HI> in not having the <HI>morel</HI> above its bill, and its &s;econd fle&s;hy eyelid being le&s;s protuberant, and its bill &s;traight in&s;tead of curv|ed. It cro&s;&s;es with the <HI>Bagadais,</HI> and produces a very thick and large breed.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Turki&s;h Pigeon; which, like the <HI>Ba|gadais,</HI> has a thick excre&s;cence above the bill, with a red bar extending from the bill round the eyes. This bird is very thick, cre&s;ted, low legged, with a broad body and wings: &s;ome are of a tawny colour, or a brown bordering on black, &s;uch as repre&s;ented in Pl. CXLIX. of Fri&s;ch; others are of an iron-gray, lint|gray, chamois, and wine-&s;op. The&s;e Pigeons are very inactive, and never roam from their volery.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Roman Pigeons; which are not quite &s;o large as the Turki&s;h, but have the &s;ame extent of wings, but no cre&s;t; they are black, tawny, or &s;potted.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the large&s;t of the Dome&s;tic Pigeons; there are &s;ome of a middle &s;ize, and others
<PB N="450" REF="476">
&s;maller. Among the rough-legged Pigeons, which are feathered as low as the nails, we may di&s;tingui&s;h the one without a cre&s;t, figured by Fri&s;ch, Pl.

The cre&s;ted rough-legged Pigeon is al&s;o called the <HI>Month Pigeon,</HI> becau&s;e it hatches every month, and does not wait till its young are able to pro|vide for them&s;elves. Its breed is very profitable, though we mu&s;t not reckon upon twelve hatches annually; the u&s;ual number is eight or nine, which is &s;till very great.</P>
<P>In the intermediate and &s;mall breed of Do|me&s;tic Pigeons, we may di&s;tingui&s;h the Jacobine Pigeon<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pigeon Nonain,</HI> i. e.

Pigeon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pigeon Maurin.</NOTE>; which is entirely
black, except the head and the tips of its wings, which are white: to this we
may re|fer the Pigeon of Pl. CL. of Fri&s;ch, which he names in German
<HI>Schleyer,</HI> or <HI>Parruquen-taube</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>The veiled</HI> or <HI>perruked Pigeon.</HI></NOTE>, and
in Latin <HI>Columba-galerita,</HI> that is, Hooded Pigeon. But in general all
of the Jacobines are hooded, or rather have a half-cowl on the head, which
de&s;cends along the neck, and extends along the brea&s;t like a cravat of
ruffled feathers: this variety is nearly allied to the Pouter Pigeon, for its
&s;ize is the &s;ame, it al&s;o &s;omewhat inflates its craw, nor is it &s;o
prolific as the other Jaco|bines, of which the mo&s;t perfect are entirely
white. In all of them, the bill is very &s;hort; the latter breed often, but
their young is very &s;mall.</P>
<P>The Shaker or Peacock Pigeon is &s;omewhat larger than the Jacobine. The fine&s;t of this breed have thirty-two feathers in the tail, while the common &s;ort have only twelve. After they have rai&s;ed their tail, they bend it forwards, and at the &s;ame time draw back the head &s;o as to make it meet the tail. They &s;hake al&s;o during the whole of this movement; either from the violent contraction of the mu&s;cles, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, for there is more than one breed of Shaker Pigeons<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a Shaker Pigeon different from the Peacock Pigeon, its tail not being near &s;o broad. The Peacock Pigeon has been denominated by Willughby and Ray, <HI>Columba tremula laticauda</HI> (broad-tailed Shaker Pigeon); and the Shaker Pigeon <HI>Columba tremula angu&s;ticauda &s;eu acuticauda</HI> (narrow-tailed or &s;harp-tailed Shaker Pigeon): the latter, though it does not rai&s;e or di&s;play its tail, trembles, they &s;ay, almo&s;t continually.</NOTE>. They make this di&s;play of the tail
<PB N="452" REF="480">
commonly in the love &s;ea&s;on; though &s;ome|times al&s;o upon other occa&s;ions. The female rai&s;es and di&s;plays her tail al&s;o like the male, and is quite as beautiful; &s;ome kinds are entirely white, others white with the head and tail black. To this &s;econd variety we mu&s;t refer the Pigeon figured in Pl. CLI. of Fri&s;ch, which he calls in German, <HI>Pfau-taube,</HI> or <HI>Huner&s;chwantz</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>Peacock</HI> or <HI>Hen-tailed Pigeon.</HI></NOTE>, and in Latin, <HI>Columba caudata.</HI> That Author re|marks at the &s;ame time, that the Shaker Pigeon di&s;plays its tail, and works eagerly and con&s;tant|ly with its head and tail, nearly in the &s;ame way as the <HI>wryneck.</HI> The&s;e Pigeons do not fly &s;o well as the others; their broad tail catches the wind, and they often fall to the ground; for this rea&s;on they are bred chiefly from curio&s;ity. However, the&s;e Pigeons, though by them&s;elves they could perform no di&s;tant journies, have been carried into remote countries: in the Philippine i&s;lands, &s;ays Gemelli Carreri, are Pigeons that elevate and &s;pread their tail like the peacock.</P>
<P>The Poli&s;h Pigeons are larger than the Shaker Pigeons. Their di&s;tingui&s;hing character is a very thick and &s;hort bill, their eyes bordered
<PB REF="481">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>N^o. 49 THE POLISH PIGEON.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="453" REF="482"> with a red circle, their legs very low. They
are of different colours, many black, others rufous, chamois, dotted with gray,
or entirely white.</P>
<P>The Turbet Pigeon is one of the &s;malle&s;t, being &s;carcely larger than a turtle, with which it breeds. The Turbet Pigeon is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Jacobine, the former not having the half cowl on the head and neck, but only a tuft of feathers that appear to ruffle on the brea&s;t and under the throat. The&s;e Pigeons are very hand|&s;ome, well-made, and have a neat air; &s;ome are of the colour of wine-&s;op, others chamois, painted, rufous, gray, entirely white or black, and others white with black mantles. The la&s;t variety is what Fri&s;ch repre&s;ents in his CXLVII. Plate, under the German name <HI>Mowchen,</HI> and the Latin de&s;ignation <HI>Columba collo hir&s;uto</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pigeon with &s;haggy neck.</NOTE>. This Pigeon has an aver&s;ion to pairing with other Pigeons, and is not very prolific: it is be&s;ides very &s;mall, and ea&s;ily falls a prey to the rapa|cious tribes. Upon all the&s;e accounts it is &s;carcely ever rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Pigeons called Dutch-&s;hell Pigeons, be|cau&s;e on the back of the head are rever&s;ed feathers forming a &s;ort of &s;hell, are al&s;o &s;mall. Their head is black, the end of the tail and the tip of the wings are al&s;o black; but all the re&s;t of the body is white. Some are red-headed, blue-headed, or the head and tail yellow;
<PB N="454" REF="483">
the tail is u&s;ually of the &s;ame colour with the head, but the wings are always white. The fir&s;t variety which has a black head, re&s;embles &s;o much the Sea-&s;wallow, that &s;ome per&s;ons have applied to it that name; and with the more appearance of analogy, as this Pigeon has not its body round like mo&s;t of the re&s;t, but long and very &s;lender.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Shell Pigeon which we have ju&s;t mentioned, there are other Pigeons which have the head and tail blue; others where the&s;e parts are black; others where they are red; others where they are yellow: but in all the four the extremity of the tail is of the &s;ame colour with the head. They are nearly as large as the Peacock Pigeons, and their plumage is very neat and &s;ingular.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome named Swallow Pigeons, that are not larger than turtles, and like them are &s;lender &s;haped and of very nimble flight: the whole of the under-&s;ide of their body is white, and the upper-&s;ide, as well as the neck, the head and the tail, black, or red, or blue, or yellow, with a &s;mall ca&s;que of the &s;ame colours on the head, but the under-&s;ide of the head is always white, and &s;o is that of the neck. To this va|riety we mu&s;t refer the <HI>Galeated Pigeon</HI> of John|&s;ton and Willughby, of which the principal character is, that the feathers of the head and tho&s;e of the tail and the quills of the wings are always of the &s;ame colour, and the body of a different colour; for example, the body white,
<PB REF="484">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>N^o. 52 THE TURBET PIGEON.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="455" REF="485"> and the head, the tail, and the wings black,
or of &s;ome other colour, whatever it be.</P>
<P>The Carmelite Pigeon, which forms a differ|ent breed, is perhaps the lowe&s;t and the &s;malle&s;t of all our Pigeons; it appears &s;quatted like the goat-&s;ucker; it is al&s;o very rough-legged, the feathers on its thighs being exceeding long, and its legs remarkably &s;hort. The males and females re&s;emble each other, as in mo&s;t of the other breeds. It includes four varieties, which like tho&s;e of the preceding &s;orts, are al&s;o of an iron-gray, chamois, wine-&s;op, and &s;oft gray: but in them all, the under-&s;ide of the body and of the wings is white, all the upper-&s;ide of the body being of the colours we have mentioned. Their bill is &s;maller than that of a turtle, and they have a little tuft behind the head, which draws to a point as in the cre&s;ted lark.</P>
<P>The Drum Pigeon or <HI>glou-glou,</HI> of which we have &s;poken, is al&s;o very low and rough-legged, but larger than the Carmelite Pigeon, and nearly of the &s;ize of the Poli&s;h Pigeon.</P>
<P>The Da&s;hed Pigeon, which is marked by a daub, as it were, of a black, a yellow, or a red pencil, above the bill only, and as far as the middle of the head, with the tail of the &s;ame colour, and all the re&s;t of the body white, is highly valued by the curious. It is not rough-legged; it is of the &s;ize of the ordinary Proud Pigeons.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="486">
The Swi&s;s Pigeons are &s;maller than the Com|mon Pigeons, and not larger than the Bi&s;ets; they even fly as nimbly. There are &s;everal kinds of them; viz. tho&s;e garni&s;hed with red, with blue, and with yellow, on a &s;ilky white ground with a collar, which forms a hor&s;e-&s;hoe on the brea&s;t, and is of an embroidered red. They have often two bars on the wings, of the &s;ame colour with that of the hor&s;e-&s;hoe.</P>
<P>There are other Swi&s;s Pigeons not garni&s;h|ed with intermingled tints, &s;haded over the whole body with an uniform &s;late colour, and without any collar or hor&s;e-&s;hoe. Others are called <HI>ja&s;pered yellow collars, mailed yellow collars,</HI> and others <HI>very mailed yellow collars,</HI> &amp;c. becau&s;e they have collars of that colour.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another variety of the Swi&s;s Pigeons, called the <HI>Azure Pigeon,</HI> becau&s;e its plumage inclines more to blue than the pre|ceding.</P>
<P>The Tumbler Pigeon is one of the &s;malle&s;t kind; that which Fri&s;ch has figured, Pl. CXLVIII. under the names <HI>Tummel-taube, tumler, Columba ge&s;tuo&s;a &s;eu ge&s;ticularia,</HI> is of a rufous brown; but &s;ome are gray, and variegated with rufous and gray. It whirls round in its flight, like a body thrown in the air; for this rea&s;on it has received its appellation. All the&s;e motions &s;eem to im|ply vertigoes, which, as I have ob&s;erved, may be a&s;cribed to the effect of dome&s;tication. It flies very

&s;wiftly, and &s;oars higher than any; but its movements are precipitate and very irregular. Fri&s;ch &s;ays, that its fluttering re&s;embles in &s;ome mea&s;ure the capers of a rope-dancer; it has been called the Harlequin Pigeon <HI>(Columba ge&s;tuo&s;a).</HI> Its &s;hape is pretty much like that of the Bi&s;et; it is commonly employed to attract Pigeons from other dove-cots, becau&s;e it flies higher and far|ther, and continues longer on the wing than the re&s;t, and more ea&s;ily e&s;capes the hawk.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the Wheeler Pigeon, which Bri&s;&s;on has called after Willughby, the <HI>Smiter Pigeon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columba Percu&s;&s;or, <HI>Will.</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>; it turns round in its flight, and flaps &s;o vigorou&s;ly with its wings, as to make as much noi&s;e as a mill-clapper; and often in the violence of its exertions, which &s;eem to be almo&s;t convul&s;ive, it breaks &s;ome of its wing-quills. The&s;e Wheeler or Smiter Pigeons are common|ly gray, with black &s;pots on the wings.</P>

<P>The&s;e five families of Pigeons are only, we &s;ee, &s;econdary varieties of the fir&s;t, which we have de&s;cribed from the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome curious people, who have pa&s;&s;ed their lives in breeding Pigeons, and particularly the Sieur Fournier, who has for &s;everal years had the charge of the voleries and poultry-yards of his Highne&s;s the Count of Clermont. That prince, who di&s;covered an early ta&s;te for the arts, di|rected all &s;orts of dome&s;tic fowls to be collected from every quarter, and continually intermixed.

<P>AS this bird is much larger than the Bi&s;et, and as both are nearly related to the Dome&s;tic Pigeon, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;mall breeds of our hou&s;e-pigeons have proceeded from the Bi&s;ets, and the large breeds from the Ring Pigeons: and this conjecture is the more pro|bable, as the ancients were in the practice of rearing and fattening the Ring Pigeons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Perrottus, <HI>apud Ge&s;nerum.</HI></NOTE>. The only circum&s;tance that &s;eems to oppo&s;e this idea is, that the &s;mall dome&s;tic Pigeons cro&s;s with the large &s;orts, while the Ring Pigeon &s;eems not to intermix with the Bi&s;et, and, though they inhabit the &s;ame tracts, do not mix together. The turtle, as it is &s;till more ea&s;ily rai&s;ed and kept
<PB N="470" REF="502">
in hou&s;es, might equally be regarded as the &s;ource of &s;ome of our dome&s;tic breeds, were it not, like the Ring Pigeon, of a peculiar &s;pecies, that intermingles not with the Wild Pigeons. But though in their native fore&s;ts, where each can po&s;&s;e&s;s its proper female, the&s;e birds are never ob&s;erved to a&s;&s;ociate together, yet when they are deprived of their liberty, and have no longer the opportunity of &s;election, the force of pa&s;&s;ion may obliterate the principle of choice, and may impel them to unite with the females of their kindred &s;pecies, and give birth to a progeny of hybrids. Nor will the offspring, like the males, be bla&s;ted with &s;terility, but may, like the breed between the he-goat and the &s;heep, be capable of reproduction. To judge from analogy, the Pigeon tribe con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tate of nature of three prin|cipal &s;pecies, as we have ob&s;erved, and of two that may be regarded as intermediate. On the&s;e the Greeks be&s;towed five different names: the fir&s;t and large&s;t is the <HI>Pha&s;&s;a</HI> or <HI>Phatta,</HI> which is our Ring Pigeon: the &s;econd is <HI>Peleias,</HI> which is our Wild Pigeon: the third is the <HI>Trugon</HI> or the Turtle: the fourth, which is the fir&s;t of the intermediate kinds, is the <HI>Oinas,</HI> which being rather larger than the Wild Pigeon, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as relap&s;ed from the &s;tate of dome&s;tica|tion: the fifth is the <HI>Phaps,</HI> which is a Ring Pigeon &s;maller than the <HI>Pha&s;&s;a,</HI> and for that rea&s;on called the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Pigeon,</HI> but which ap|pears to us to be only a variety of the &s;pecies of
<PB N="471" REF="503">
the Ring Pigeon; for it has been ob&s;erved that the Ring Pigeons are of different &s;izes, according to the nature of the climate.&mdash;Thus all the no|minal &s;pecies, ancient or modern, may be re|duced to three, viz. the Wild Pigeon, the Ring Pigeon, and the Turtle, which have all perhaps contributed to the endle&s;s varieties of our do|me&s;tic Pigeons.</P>
<P>The Ring Pigeons arrive in our provinces in the &s;pring, rather earlier than the Bi&s;ets, and re|tire in autumn &s;omewhat later. The month of Augu&s;t is the time in France when the young are the mo&s;t numerous; and it appears that they i&s;&s;ue from the &s;econd hatch, which is made to|wards the end of the &s;ummer; for the fir&s;t hatch being very early in the &s;pring, the ne&s;t is not covered with leaves, and is therefore too much expo&s;ed and often de&s;troyed. Some Ring Pigeons remain in mo&s;t of our provinces during winter; they perch like the Bi&s;ets, but do not like them con&s;truct their ne&s;ts in holes of trees; they place them on the tops, and build them neatly with &s;ticks: the ne&s;t is flat and &s;o wide as to admit at once both the male and female. I have a&s;certained that very early in the &s;pring, they lay two and often three eggs; for &s;everal ne&s;ts have been brought to me containing two and &s;ometimes three young ones already &s;trong in the beginning of April<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne &s;ays, that the poulterers of Orleans buy, in the &s;ea&s;on of the ne&s;ts, a con&s;iderable number of Turtles, which they blow with the mouth and fatten with millet, &s;o that in le&s;s than a fort|night they are fit to be carried to Paris. That in the &s;ame manner they fatten the Ring Pigeons, and al&s;o carry thither Bi&s;ets and other Pigeons, which they call <HI>Po&s;tes,</HI> and which are, according to them, Pigeons that have for&s;aken dove-cots, and roam at will, ne&s;tling &s;ometimes in one place, and &s;ometimes in another, in churches, in towers, in the walls of old ca&s;tles, or in rocks.&mdash;This fact proves that the Ring Pigeon, like all the Pigeons and Turtles, can be reared like other dome&s;tic birds, and con&s;e|quently that they may have given birth to the mo&s;t beautiful and the large&s;t dove-cot Pigeons. M. Le Roy, Lieutenant of the chaces, and in&s;pector of the park at Ver&s;ailles, a&s;&s;ures me, that the young Ring Pigeons taken from the ne&s;t, tamed and fattened very well, and that even the old Ring Pigeons caught by a net, were ea&s;ily reconciled to live in the voleries, where in a very &s;hort time by blowing they grow fat.</NOTE>. Some per&s;ons have
<PB N="472" REF="504">
a&s;&s;erted that in our climate they breed only once a-year, unle&s;s they are robbed of their eggs or young, which, it is well known, obliges all birds to a &s;econd hatch.

undoubtedly takes place, and very probably the ca&s;e is nearly the &s;ame in cold countries. The Ring Pigeon has a louder &s;ort of cooing than the Common Pigeon, but is never heard except in the love &s;ea&s;on, and in fine weather; for when it rains, the&s;e birds are &s;ilent, and &s;eldom does their &s;ong cheer the gloom of winter. They live upon wild fruits, acorns, beech-ma&s;t, &s;traw|berries, of which they are very fond, and al&s;o beans and grain of all kinds. They make great havoc among the corn when it is &s;hed or lodg|ed, and if the&s;e &s;orts of food fail them, they have recour&s;e to herbage. They drink like other Pigeons, that is at one draught, without rai&s;ing their head, till they have &s;wallowed as much water as they have occa&s;ion for. As their fle&s;h, e&s;pecially when they are young, is excellent meat, their ne&s;ts are much &s;ought for, and great numbers are robbed. This deva&s;tation, joined to their &s;low multiplication, much reduces every where the &s;pecies.

and re&s;embled the Turtle more than the Pigeon; it was re&s;tle&s;s, and
mole&s;ted the other birds of the volery. The father Pigeon was of a very
&s;mall kind, perfectly white, with black wings.</Q> It has not been ob&s;erved
whether the&s;e hybrids are prolific; but the general fact proves at lea&s;t
the great analogy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the&s;e two birds. It is
therefore not unlikely, as we have before remarked, that all the varieties of

<P>What &s;eems to confirm our opinion with re|gard to the&s;e unions, which may be conceived to be illegitimate, as being out of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, is, that exce&s;&s;ive ardor which the&s;e birds feel in the &s;ea&s;on of love.

<P>I &s;hall cite only one fact which manife&s;ts the ardour of the&s;e birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Turtle, M. Roy writes me, differs from the Ring Pigeon and the Common Pigeon, by its di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and incon&s;tancy, notwith&s;tanding its reputation for the contrary qualities. Not only females that are &s;hut up in voleries receive promi&s;cuou&s;ly all the males; but I have &s;een wild ones, which were neither con|&s;trained nor corrupted by dome&s;tication, give favours to two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively on the &s;ame branch.</NOTE>: if the males be put in one cage and the females in another, they will copulate together as if they were of different &s;exes: the males indeed burn &s;ooner and with more inten&s;ity than the females.

female Collared Turtle, and re&s;embled more the father than the mother. I have
no doubt but the&s;e are prolific. The Collared Tur|tle is only &s;omewhat

analogous in their di&s;po&s;i|tions than in their figure. They eat and drink
in the &s;ame manner, without lifting their head till they have &s;wallowed as
much as they want; they fly in flocks; their voice is a loud mur|mur, or a
plaintive moan, rather than an ar|ticulated &s;ong; they lay only two eggs,
&s;ome|times three; all of them hatch &s;everal times in the year in warm
countries, or when kept in voleries.
