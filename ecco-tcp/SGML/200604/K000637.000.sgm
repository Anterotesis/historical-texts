<HEAD>The Publi&s;her's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE World is much indebted to the famous Sir
<HI>Humphry Pole&s;worth,</HI> for his ingenious and im|partial
Account of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Law-Suit; yet
there is ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint again&s;t him,
in that he retails it only by Parcels, and won't give
us the whole Work; This forces me, who am only the
Publi&s;her, to be&s;peak the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Friends and
Acquaintance, to engage him to lay a&s;ide that &s;tingy
Humour, and gratify the Curio&s;ity of the Publick, at
once. He pleads in excu&s;e, that they are only private
Memoirs, wrote for his own U&s;e, in a loo&s;e Style, to
&s;erve as a help to his ordinary Conver&s;ation. I repre|&s;ented
to him the good Reception the two fir&s;t Parts
had met, that tho' they had been calculated by him,
only for the Meridian of <HI>Grub&s;treet,</HI> yet they were ta|ken
Notice of by the better &s;ort; that the World was
now &s;ufficiently acquainted with <HI>John Bull,</HI> and intere|&s;ted
it &s;elf in his little Concerns. He An&s;wer'd with
a Smile, that he had indeed &s;ome trifling Things to
impart that concerned <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Relations and Do|me&s;tick
Affairs; if the&s;e would &s;atisfy me, he gave
me free leave to make u&s;e of them, becau&s;e they would
&s;erve to make the Hi&s;tory of the Law-Suit more intel|ligible.
When I had look'd over the Manu&s;cript, I
found likewi&s;e &s;ome further Account of the Compo&s;i|tion,
which perhaps may not be unacceptable to &s;uch
as have read the two former Parts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Character of <HI>John Bull's</HI> Mother.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> had a Mother, whom he Lov'd and Honour'd
extremely, a Di&s;creet, Grave, Sober Good Con|dition'd,
Cleanly Old Gentlewoman, as ever
liv'd; &s;he was none of your Cro&s;s-grain'd termagant
<PB REF="5">
&s;colding Jades, that one had as good be hang'd as
live in the Hou&s;e with, &s;uch as are always cen&s;uring
the Conduct, and telling &s;candalous Stories of their
Neighbours, extolling their own good Qualities, and
undervaluing tho&s;e of others. On the contrary, &s;he
was of a Meek Spirit, and as &s;he was &s;trictly Virtuous
her &s;elf, &s;o &s;he always put the be&s;t Con&s;truction upon
the Words and Actions of her Neighbours, except
where they were irreconcileable to the Rules of Hone&s;ty
and Decency. She was neither one of your preci&s;e
<HI>Prudes,</HI> nor one of your phanta&s;tical old <HI>Belles,</HI> that
Dre&s;s them&s;elves like Girls of Fifteen; as &s;he neither
wore a Ruff, Fore-head Cloth, nor High-crown'd
Hat, &s;o &s;he had laid a&s;ide Feathers, Flowers, and
crimpt Ribons in her Head-dre&s;s, Furbulow Scarfs and
Hoop'd Petticoats. She &s;corn'd to Patch and Paint,
yet &s;he lov'd to keep her Hands and her Face Clean.
Tho' &s;he wore no flaunting lac'd Ruffles, &s;he would
not keep her &s;elf in a con&s;tant Sweat with grea&s;y Flan|nel:
Tho' her Hair was not &s;tuck with Jewels, &s;he
was not a&s;ham'd of a Diamond Cro&s;s; &s;he was not
like &s;ome Ladies, hung about with Toys and Trinkets,
Twi&s;er Ca&s;es, Pocket-Gla&s;&s;es and E&s;&s;ence Bottles; &s;he
us'd only a Gold Watch and an Almanack, to mark
the Hours and the Holy-Days. Her Furniture was
neat and genteel, well fancy'd with <HI>a bon Gou&s;t.</HI> As
&s;he affected not the Grandeur of a State with a Cano|py,
&s;he thought there was no Offence in an Elbow
Chair; &s;he had laid a&s;ide your Carving, Gilding and
Japan Work, as being too apt to gather Dirt, but
&s;he never could be prevail'd upon to part with plain
Wain&s;cot and clean Hangings. There are &s;ome La|dies
that affect to &s;mell a &s;tink in every Thing; they
are always highly perfum'd, and continually burning
Frankincen&s;e in their Rooms; &s;he was above &s;uch Af|fectation,
yet &s;he never would lay a&s;ide the U&s;e of
Brooms and &s;crubbing Bru&s;hes, and &s;crupl'd not to lay
her Linnen in fre&s;h Lavender: She was no le&s;s genteel
in her Behaviour, well-bred without Affectation, in
the due mean between one of your affected Cur&s;ying
<PB REF="6">
pieces of Formality, and your Romps that have
no regard to the common Rules of Civility. There
are &s;ome Ladies that affect a Mighty regard for their
Relations; <HI>We mu&s;t not Eat to Day, for my Uncle</HI> Tom<HI>,
or my Cou&s;in</HI> Betty <HI>dy'd this time ten Years</HI>; <HI>Let's have
a Ball to Night, it is my Neighbour &s;uch a ones Birth-day</HI>;
&s;he look'd upon all this as Grimace; yet &s;he con&s;tant|ly
ob&s;erv'd her Husband's Birth-day, her Wedding-day,
and &s;ome few more. Tho' &s;he was a truly good
Woman, and had a &s;incere Motherly Love for her Son
<HI>John,</HI> yet there wanted not tho&s;e who endeavour'd to
create a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between them, and they
had &s;o far prevail'd with him once, that he turn'd her
out of Doors to his geeat Sorrow, as he found after|wards,
for his Affairs went all at &s;ixes and &s;evens. She
was no le&s;s Judicious in the turn of her Conver&s;ation
and Choice of her Studies, in which &s;he far exceeded
all her Sex; your Rakes that hate the Company of all
&s;ober, grave Gentlewomen, would bear hers, and &s;he
would by her hand&s;ome manner of proceeding &s;ooner
reclaim than &s;ome that were more &s;ower and re&s;erv'd;
&s;he was a zealous Preacher up of Cha&s;tity, and Con|jugal
Fidelity in Wives, and by no means a Friend to
the new-fangl'd Doctrine of the <HI>Indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of
Cuckoldom:</HI> Tho &s;he advanc'd her Opinions with a
becoming A&s;&s;urance, yet &s;he never u&s;her'd them in,
as &s;ome po&s;itive Creatures will do, with dogmatical
A&s;&s;ertions, <HI>This is infallible; I cannot be mi&s;taken;
none but a Rogue can deny it.</HI> It has been ob&s;erv'd that
&s;uch People are oftner in the Wrong than any Body;
tho' &s;he had a thou&s;and good Qualities, &s;he was not
without her Faults, among&s;t which one might perhaps
reckon too great Lenity to her Servants, to whom
&s;he always gave good Coun&s;el, but often too gentle
Correction. I thought I could not &s;ay le&s;s of <HI>John
Bull</HI>'s Mother, becau&s;e &s;he bears a part in the following
Tran&s;actions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Character of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Si&s;ter <HI>Peg,</HI> with the Quarrels
that happen'd between Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s, in their Child|hood.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> had a Si&s;ter a poor Girl that had been &s;tarv'd
at Nur&s;e; any Body would have gue&s;s'd Mi&s;s to
have been bred up under the Influence of a cruel
Step-Dame, and <HI>John</HI> to be the Fondling of a tender
Mother. <HI>John</HI> look'd ruddy and plump, with a pair
of Cheeks like a Trumpeter; Mi&s;s look'd pale and
wan, as if &s;he had the Green-Sickne&s;s; and no wonder
for <HI>John</HI> was the Darling, he had all the good Bits,
was cramm'd with good Pullet, Chicken, Pig, Goo&s;e
and Capon; while Mi&s;s had only a little Oatmeal and
Water, or a dry Cru&s;t without Butter. <HI>John</HI> had his
golden Pippens, Peaches and Nectarnes; poor Mi&s;s
a Crap Apple, Sloe or Blackberry. Ma&s;ter lay in the
be&s;t Apartment, with his Bed Chamber toward the
South Sun. Mi&s;s lodg'd in a Garret, expos'd to the
North Wind, which &s;hrevel'd her Countenance;
however, this U&s;age tho it &s;tunted the poor Girl in
her Growth, gave her a hardy Con&s;titution; &s;he had
Life and Spirit in abundance, and knew when &s;he was
ill u&s;ed; Now and then &s;he would &s;eize upon <HI>John</HI>'s
Commons, &s;natch a Leg of a Pullet, or a bit of good
Beef, for which they were &s;ure to go to Fi&s;ticuffs.
Ma&s;ter was indeed too &s;trong for her, but Mi&s;s would
not yield in the lea&s;t Point, but ev'n when Ma&s;ter
had got her down, &s;he would &s;cratch and bite like a
Tyger; when he gave her a Cuff on the Ear, &s;he
would prick him with her Knitting-Needle. <HI>John</HI>
brought a great Chain one Day to tye her to the Bed
Po&s;t, for which Affront Mi&s;s aim'd a Pen-knife at his
Heart: In &s;hort, the&s;e Quarrels grew up to rooted
Aver&s;ions, they gave one another Nicknames, &s;he
call'd him <HI>Gundyguts,</HI> and he call'd her Lou&s;y <HI>Peg:</HI>
Tho' the Girl was a right clever Wench as any was,
and thro' her pale Looks, you might di&s;cern Spirit and
Vivacity, which made her not indeed a perfect Beauty,
but &s;omething that was agreeable. It was barbarous
<PB REF="8">
in Parents not to take Notice of the&s;e early Quarrels,
and make them live better together, &s;uch Dome&s;tick
Fewds proving afterwards the occa&s;ion of Misfortunes
to them both. <HI>Peg</HI> had indeed &s;ome odd Humours and
comical Antipathy, for which <HI>John</HI> would jeer her.
<HI>What think you of my Si&s;ter</HI> Peg (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) <HI>that faints at
the Sound of an Organ, and yet will dance and frisk at the
Noi&s;e of a Bagpipe? What's that to you,</HI> Gundy-guts<HI>,
(quoth</HI> Peg<HI>) every Body's to chu&s;e their own Mu&s;ick.</HI>' Then
Peg had taken a Fancy not to &s;ay her <HI>Pater-no&s;ter,</HI>
which made People imagine &s;trange things of her. Of
the three Brothers that have made &s;uch a Clutter in
the World, Lord <HI>Peter, Martin</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI>; <HI>Jack</HI> had of
late been her Inclinations; Lord <HI>Peter</HI> &s;he dete&s;ted;
nor did <HI>Martin</HI> &s;tand much better in her good Graces,
but <HI>Jack</HI> had found the way to her Heart. I have
often admir'd what Charms &s;he di&s;cover'd in that
aukward Booby, till I talk'd with a Per&s;on that was
acquainted with the Intrigue, who gave me the follow|ing
Account of it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Jack</HI>'s Charms, or the Method by which he gain'd <HI>Peg</HI>'s
Heart.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, <HI>Jack</HI> was a very young Fellow, by
much the younge&s;t of the three Brothers, and Peo|ple
indeed wonder'd how &s;uch a young up&s;tart Jack|anapes
&s;hou'd grow &s;o pert and &s;aucy, and take &s;o
much upon him. (2.) <HI>Jack</HI> brag'd of greater Abilities
than other Men; he was well gifted, as he pretended;
I need not tell you what &s;ecret Influence that has upon
the Ladies. (3.) <HI>Jack</HI> had a mo&s;t &s;candalous Tongue,
and per&s;uaded <HI>Peg</HI> that all Mankind be&s;ides him&s;elf
were pox'd by that &s;carletfac'd Whore <HI>Signiora Bubo|nia.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">As for his Brother Lord <HI>Peter,</HI> the Tokens
were evident in him Blotches, Scabs, and the Co|rona:
His Brother <HI>Martin</HI> though he was not quite
&s;o bad, had &s;ome nocturnal Pains, which his Friends
pretended were only Scorbutical; but, he was &s;ure,
proceeded from a wor&s;e Cau&s;e.</Q> By &s;uch malicious
In&s;inuations, he had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Lady, that he was
<PB REF="9">
the only Man in the World, of a &s;ound, pure, and
untainted Con&s;titution: Tho' there were &s;ome that
&s;tuck not to &s;ay, that <HI>Signiora Bubonia</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> rail'd
at one another, only the better to hide an Intrigue;
and, that <HI>Jack</HI> had been found with <HI>Signiora</HI> under
his Cloak, carrying her home in a dark &s;tormy Night.
(4.) <HI>Jack</HI> was a prodigious Ogler; he would Ogle
you the out&s;ide of his Eye inward, and the White up|ward.
(5.) <HI>Jack</HI> gave him&s;elf out for a Man of great
E&s;tate in the Fortunate I&s;lands, of which the &s;ole Pro|perty
was ve&s;ted in his Per&s;on; by this Trick he chea|ted
abundance of poor People of &s;mall Sums, pre|tending
to make over Plantations in the &s;aid I&s;lands;
but, when the poor Wretches came there with <HI>Jack</HI>'s
Grant, they were beat, mock'd, and turn'd out of
Doors. (6.) I told you that <HI>Peg</HI> was whim&s;ical, and
lov'd any thing that was particular: In that way <HI>Jack</HI>
was her Man; for he neither thought, &s;poke, dre&s;s'd,
nor acted like other Mortals: He was for your bold
Strokes; he rail'd at Fops, tho' him&s;elf the mo&s;t af|fected
in the World; in&s;tead of the common Fa&s;hion,
he would vi&s;it his Mi&s;tre&s;s in a Mourning Cloak, Band,
&s;hort Cuffs, and a peaked Beard. He invented a way
of coming into a Room backwards, which he &s;aid &s;hew'd
more Humility, and le&s;s Affectation: where other
People &s;tood, he &s;at; where they &s;at, he &s;tood; when
he went to Court, he us'd to kick away the State, and
&s;it down by his Prince Cheek by Choul, <HI>Confound the&s;e
States</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>they are a modern Invention</HI>; when he
&s;poke to his Prince he always turn'd his Br<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ch
upon him; if he was advis'd to fa&s;t for his Health he
would eat Roa&s;t beef; if he was allow'd a more plen|tiful
Diet, then he would be &s;ure that Day to live
upon Watergruel; he would cry at a Wedding, laugh
and make Je&s;ts at a Funeral. He was no le&s;s &s;ingular
in his Opinions; you would have bur&s;t your &s;ides to
hear him talk Politicks: <Q REND="inline">All Governments (&s;ays
he) is founded upon the right Di&s;tribution of Pu|ni&s;hments;
decent Executions keep the World in
awe; for that Rea&s;on the Majority of Mankind
<PB REF="10">
ought to be hang'd every Year; for Example, I
&s;uppo&s;e, the Magi&s;trate ought to pa&s;s an irrever&s;ible
Sentence upon all blue-ey'd Children from the Cra|dle;
but that there may be &s;ome &s;hew of Ju&s;tice in
his proceeding, the&s;e Children ought to be Train'd
up, by Ma&s;ters appointed for that purpo&s;e, to all
&s;orts of Villany, that they may de&s;erve their Fate,
and the Execution of them may &s;erve as an Object
of Terror to the re&s;t of Mankind.</Q> As to the giving
of Pardons he had this &s;ingular Method, That when
the&s;e Wretches had the Ropes about their Necks, it
&s;hould be enquired, who believ'd they &s;hould be
hanged, and who not? The fir&s;t were to be Pardon'd,
the la&s;t hang'd out-right: Such as were once par|don'd,
were never to be hang'd afterwards, for any
Crime what&s;oever. He had &s;uch Skill in Phy&s;iogno|my,
that he would pronounce peremptorily upon a
Mans Face, That Fellow (&s;ays he) do what he will,
can&punc;t avoid Hanging; he has a hanging Look. By
the &s;ame Art, he would progno&s;ticate a Principality
to a Scoundrel. He was no le&s;s particular in the
Choice of his Studies; they were generally bent to|wards
exploded Chimera's, the <HI>perpetum Mobile,</HI> the
circular Shot, Philo&s;opher's Stone, and &s;ilent Gun|powder,
making Chains for Flea's, Nets for Flies,
and In&s;truments to unrevel Cobwebs, and &s;plit Hairs.
Thus, I think, I have given you a di&s;tinct Account of
the Methods he practis'd upon <HI>Peg.</HI> Her Brother would
now and then ask her. <Q REND="inline">What a Devil do&s;t thou &s;ee
in that pragmatical Coxcomb, to make thee &s;o in
Love with him? He is a fit Match for a Tailor or a
Shoemaker's Daughter, but not for you that are a
Gentlewoman. Fancy is free (quoth <HI>Peg</HI>) I'll take
my awn way, do you take yours; I do no care for
your flaunting Beaus, that gang with their Brea&s;ts
open, and their Sarks over their Wai&s;tcoats, that
acco&s;t me with &s;et Speeches out of <HI>Sidney</HI>'s <HI>Arcadia,</HI>
or, <HI>The Academy of Compliments. Jack</HI> is a &s;ober grave
Youngman; tho' he has none of your &s;tudy'd Ha|rangues,
his Meaning is &s;incere: He has a great Re|gard
<PB REF="11">
to his Father's Will; and he that &s;hews him&s;elf
a good Son, will make a good Husband; be&s;ides, I
know he has the Original Deed of Conveyance to
the Fortunate I&s;lands; the others are Counterfeits.</Q>
There is nothing &s;o ob&s;tinate as young Ladies in their
Amours; the more you Cro&s;s them, the Wor&s;e they
are.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. How the Relations reconcil'd <HI>John</HI> and his Si&s;ter <HI>Peg,</HI> and
what return <HI>Peg</HI> made to <HI>John's</HI> Me&s;&s;age.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN BULL,</HI> otherwi&s;e a good natur'd Man,
was very hard-hearted to his Si&s;ter <HI>Peg,</HI> chiefly
from an Aver&s;ion he had conceived in his Infancy.
While he flouri&s;h'd, kept a warm Hou&s;e, and drove a
plentiful Trade, poor <HI>Peg</HI> was forc'd to go hawking
and pedling about the Streets, &s;elling Knives, Sci&s;&s;ars
and Shoe-buckles; now and then carry'd a Basket of
Fi&s;h to the Market; &s;ow'd, &s;pun and knit for a poor
Livelihood, till her Fingers-end were &s;ore; and when
&s;he could not get Bread for her Family, &s;he was forc'd
to hire 'em out at Journey-work to her Neighbours;
Yet in the&s;e her poor Circum&s;tances, &s;he &s;till pre&s;erv'd
the Air and Mien of a Gentlewoman; a certain decent
Pride, that extorted Re&s;pect from the haughtie&s;t of
her Neighbours; when &s;he came into any full A&s;&s;em|bly,
&s;he would not yield the <HI>pas</HI> to the be&s;t of them.
If one ask'd her, Are not you related to <HI>John Bull</HI>?
Yes (&s;ays &s;he) he has the Honour to be my Brother.
So <HI>Peg</HI>'s Affairs went, till all the Relations cry'd out
&s;hame upon <HI>John,</HI> for his barbarous U&s;age of his own
Fle&s;h and Blood; that it was an ea&s;ie matter for him
to put her in a credible way of living, not only with|out
Hurt, but with Advantage to him&s;elf, being &s;he
was an indu&s;trious Per&s;on, and might be &s;erviceable
to him in his way of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Hang her, Jade, (quoth
<HI>John</HI>) I can't endure her, as long as &s;he keeps that
Ra&s;cal <HI>Jack</HI>'s Company. They told him, the way to
reclaim her was to take her into his Hou&s;e; that by
Conver&s;ation, the childi&s;h Humours of their younger
days might be worn out. The&s;e Arguments were en|forc'd
<PB REF="12">
by a certain Incident. It happen'd that <HI>John</HI>
was at that time about making his Will, and entailing
his E&s;tate, the very &s;ame in which <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> is nam&punc;d
Executor. Now his Si&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI>'s Name being in the
Entail, he could not make a thorough Settlement
without her Con&s;ent. There was indeed a malicious
Story went about as if <HI>John</HI>'s la&s;t Wife had fall'n in
love with <HI>Jack,</HI> as he was eating Cu&s;tard a Hor&s;eback;
that &s;he per&s;waded <HI>John</HI> to take his Si&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI> into
the Hou&s;e the better to drive on her Intrigue with
<HI>Jack,</HI> concluding he would follow his Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Peg.</HI> All
I can infer from this Story is, that when one has got
a bad Character in the World, People will report
and believe any thing of them, true or fal&s;e. But to
return to my Story; when <HI>Peg</HI> receiv'd <HI>John</HI>'s Me&s;&s;age,
&s;he huff'd and &s;torm'd like the Devil: <Q REND="inline">My Brother
<HI>John</HI> (quoth &s;he) is grown wondrous kind hearted
all of a &s;uddain, but I meikle doubt, whether it be
not mair for his awn Conveniency than my good; he
draws up his Weits and his Deeds for&s;ooth, and I
mun &s;et my Hand to them, un&s;ight un&s;een. I like
the young Man he has &s;ettled upon well enough, but
I think I ought to have a valuable Con&s;ideration

becau&s;e it makes a Nook in his Park Wall; ye may
e'en tell him, he has mair than he makes good u&s;e
of; he gangs up and down drinking, roaring and
quarrelling through all the Countrey Merkats ma|king
fooli&s;h Bargins in his Cups, which he repents
when he is &s;ober; like a thriftle&s;s Wretch, &s;pending
the Goods and Gear that his Fore-Fathers won with
the Sweat of their Brows; light come, light go&punc; he
cares not a Farthing: But why &s;hould I &s;tand Surety
for his &s;illy contracts? the little I have is free, and
I can call it my own; Hame's hame be it never &s;o
hamely; I ken him well enough, he could never a|bide
me, and when he has his ends he'll e'en u&s;e me
as he did before; I'm &s;ure I &s;hall be treated like a

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of &s;ome Quarrels that happen'd after <HI>Peg</HI> was taken into
the Family.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an old Ob&s;ervation, that the Qnarrels of Rela|tions
are harder to reconcile than any other; Inju|ries
from Friends fret and gall more and the Memo|ry
of them is not &s;o ea&s;ily obliterated: This is cunning|ly
repre&s;ented by one of your old Sages, called <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> in
the Story of the Bird, that was griev'd extremely,
for being wounded with an Arrow feather'd with his
own Wing; as al&s;o of the Oak that let many a heavy
Groan, when he was cleft with a Wedge of his own
Timber. There was no Man in the World le&s;s &s;ub|ject
to Rancour than <HI>John Bull,</HI> con&s;idering how often
his good Nature had been Abus'd; yet I don't know,
but he was too apt to hearken to tatling People, that
carried Tales between him and his Si&s;ter <HI>Peg,</HI> on pur|po&s;e
to &s;ow Jealou&s;ies, and &s;et them together by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ars: They &s;ay that there were &s;ome Hard&s;hips put
upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> that had been better let alone; but it was
the Bu&s;ine&s;s of good People to re&s;train the Injuries on
<PB REF="14">
one &s;ide, and moderate the Re&s;entments on the other;
a good Friend acts both parts, the one without the
other will not do. The Purcha&s;e-Money of <HI>Peg</HI>'s Farm
was ill paid; then <HI>Peg</HI> lov'd a little good Liquor, and
the Servants &s;hut up the Wine-Cellar, but for that <HI>Peg</HI>
found a Trick, for &s;he made a fal&s;e Key; <HI>Peg's</HI> Ser|vants
complain'd that they were debar'd from all man|ner
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and never &s;uffer'd to touch the lea&s;t
thing within the Hou&s;e; if they offered to come into
the Warehou&s;e, then &s;trait went the Yard &s;lap over
their Noddle; if they ventur'd into the Counting-Room,
a Fellow would throw an Ink bottle at their
Head; if they came into the be&s;t Apartment, to &s;et
any thing there in order, they were &s;aluted with a
Broom; if they meddl'd with any thing in the Kit|chen,
it was odds but the Cook laid them over the
Pate with a Ladle; one that would have got into the
Stables, was met by two Ra&s;cals, who fell to work
with him with a Bru&s;h and a Curry-comb; &s;ome climb|ing
up into the Coach box, were told, that one of
their Companions had been there before that could
not drive, then &s;lap went the long Whip about their
Ears: On the other Hand it was complain'd, that <HI>Peg</HI>'s
Servants were always asking for Drink-Money, that they
had more than their &s;hare of the <HI>Chri&s;tmas-box</HI>; to &s;ay
the Truth, <HI>Peg</HI>'s Lads bu&s;tl'd pretty hard for that, for
when they were endeavouring to Lock it up, they got
in their great Fi&s;ts, and pull'd out Handfuls of Half-Crowns,
&s;ome Shillings and Six-pences, others in the
Scramble pick'd up Guineas and Broad-pieces. But
there happen'd a wor&s;e thing than all this, it was com|plain'd
that <HI>Peg</HI>'s Servants had great Stomachs, and
brought too many of their Friends and Acquaintance
to the Table; that <HI>John</HI>'s Family was like to be Eat
out of Hou&s;e and Home. In&s;tead of regulating this
Matter as it ought to be, <HI>Peg</HI>'s young Men were thru&s;t
away from the Table; then there was the Devil and
all to do, Spoons, Plates and Di&s;hes, flew about the
Room like mad, and Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> who was now <HI>Major
Domo,</HI> had enough to do to quiet them. <HI>Peg</HI> &s;aid this
<PB REF="15">
was contrary to Agreement, whereby &s;he was in all
things to be treated like a Child of the Family; then
&s;he call'd upon tho&s;e that had made her &s;uch fair Pro|mi&s;es,
and undertook for her Brother <HI>John</HI>'s good Be+haviour;
but alas! to her Co&s;t, &s;he found that they
were the fir&s;t and readie&s;t to do her the Injury. <HI>John</HI>
at la&s;t agreed to this Regulation, that <HI>Peg</HI>'s Footme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
might &s;it with his Book-keeper, Journey-men and Ap|prentices;
and <HI>Peg</HI>&punc;s better &s;ort of Servants might &s;it
with his Footmen, if they pleas'd.</P>
<P>Then they began to order-Plumb Porridge and
Minc'd Pies for <HI>Peg</HI>'s Dinner: <HI>Peg</HI> told them &s;he had
an Aver&s;ion to that &s;ort of Food; that upon forcing
down a Me&s;s of it &s;ome Years ago, it threw her into
a Fit, 'till &s;he brought it up again: Some alledg'd it
was nothing but Humour, that the &s;ame Me&s;s &s;hould
be &s;erv&punc;d up again for Supper, and Breakfa&s;t next
Morning; others would have made u&s;e of a Horn,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>After we had come back to the Tavern, and
taken t'other Bottle of <HI>Champaigne,</HI> we quarrell'd a
little about the Divi&s;ion of the E&s;tate; <HI>Lewis</HI> hall'd
and pull'd the Map on one &s;ide, and <HI>Frog</HI> and I on t'o|ther,
till we had like to have tore the Parchment to
pieces. At la&s;t <HI>Lewis</HI> pull'd out a pair of great Tay|lor's
Shears and clip'd off a Corner for him&s;elf, which
he &s;aid was a Mannor that lay convenient for him,
and left <HI>Frog</HI> and me the re&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of, as we pleas'd.
We were over-joy'd, to think <HI>Lewis</HI> was contented with
&s;o little, not &s;melling what was at the bottom of the
Plot. There happen'd, indeed, an Incident, that
gave us &s;ome Di&s;turbance; A Cunning Fellow, one
of my Servants, two Days after, peeping through the
Key-hole, ob&s;erv'd that Old <HI>Lewis</HI> had &s;tole away
our part of the Map, and &s;aw him fiddling and turn|ing
the Map from one Corner to the other, trying to
join the two pieces together again: He was mutte|ring
&s;omething to him&s;elf, which he did not well hear,
only the&s;e Words, <HI>'Tis great Pity, 'tis great Pity</HI>! My
Servant added, that he believ'd this had &s;ome ill-meaning;
I told him he was a Coxcomb, always pre|tending
to be Wi&s;er than his Companions; <HI>Lewis</HI> and
I are good Friends, he's an hone&s;t Fellow, and, I dare
&s;ay, will &s;tand to his Bargain. The Sequel of the
Story prov'd this Fellow's Su&s;picion to be too well-grounded;
for <HI>Lewis</HI> reveal&punc;d our whole Secret to the
Deceas'd Lord <HI>Strutt,</HI> who, in Reward to his Trea|chery,
and Revenge to <HI>Frog</HI> and me, &s;ettled his whole

<P>Why, truly Wife, it was not ea&s;ily recon|ciled
to the common Methods, but then it was the
Fa&s;hion to do &s;uch things: I have read of your Golden
Age, your Silver Age, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one might ju&s;tly call this
the Age of the Lawyers. There was hardly a Man
of Sub&s;tance in all the Country, but had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Counterfeit
that pretended to his E&s;tate: As the Philo&s;ophers
&s;ay, that there is a Duplicate of every Terre&s;trial A|nimal
at Sea, &s;o it was in this Age of the Lawyers,
there was at lea&s;t two of every thing; nay, o' my
Con&s;cience, I think there were three E&s;quire <HI>Hackums</HI>
at one time. <HI>Lewis Baboon</HI> entertain&punc;d a Fellow that
call'd him&s;elf <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Heir; I knew him no more
than the Child unborn, yet he brought me into &s;ome
Trouble and Expence. There was another that pre|tended
to be E&s;q. <HI>South</HI>; and two Lord <HI>Strutts,</HI> you
know. In &s;hort, it was u&s;ual for a parcel of Fellows
to meet, and di&s;po&s;e of the whole E&s;tates in the Coun|try:
<HI>This lies convenient for me</HI> Tom; <HI>Thou would do
more good with that</HI> Dick, <HI>than the Old Fellow that has it</HI>&punc;
So to Law they went with the true Owners; the
Lawyers got well by it, every Body el&s;e was undone.
It was a common thing for an hone&s;t Man, when he
came Home at Night, to find another Fellow domi|neering
in his Family, hectoring his Servants, calling
for Supper, and pretending to go to Bed to his Wife.
In every Hou&s;e you might ob&s;erve two <HI>Sofia</HI>'s quar|relling

<P>IT is a mo&s;t &s;ad Life we lead, my Dear
to be &s;o teaz'd paying Intere&s;t for Old
Debts, and &s;till contracting new Ones.
However I don't blame you for vindicating your Ho|nour
and cha&s;tizing old <HI>Lewis</HI>; to curb the In&s;olent,
protect the Oppre&s;t, recover ones own, and defend
what one has, are good Effects of the Law: The only
thing I want to know is how you came to make an End
of your Money before you fini&s;h'd your Law Suit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was told by the Learned in the Law,
that my Suit &s;tood upon three firm Pillars: <HI>More Mo|ny
for more Law, more Law for more Mony, and no</HI>
<PB REF="22">
<HI>Compo&s;ition.</HI> More Money for more Law was plain
Demon&s;tration, for who can go to Law without Mony?
and it was as plain, that any Man that has Mony,
may have Law for it. The third was as Evident as
the other two; for what Compo&s;ition could be made
with a Rogue that never kept a Word he &s;aid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are mo&s;t likely to get out of
this Labyrinth by the &s;econd Door, by want of ready
Money to purcha&s;e this precious Commodity: But you
&s;eem not only to have bought too much of it, but have
paid too dear for what you have bought; el&s;e how was
it po&s;&s;ible to run &s;o much in Debt, when, at this very
time the yearly Income of what is Mortgag'd to tho&s;e
U&s;urers would di&s;charge <HI>Hocus</HI>'s Bills, and give you
your Belly full of Law, or all your Life, without run|ning
one Six Pence in Debt? You have been bred up
to Bu&s;ine&s;s; I &s;uppo&s;e you can Cypher, I wonder you
never us'd your Pen and Ink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you urge me too far; prithee, dear
Wife, hold thy Tongue. Suppo&s;e a young Heir,
heedle&s;s, raw, and unexperienced, full of Spirit and
Vigour, with a favourite Pa&s;&s;ion, in the Hands of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Scriveners: Such Fellows are like your Wire

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Blood and Guts out of him. When I
wanted Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, half a dozen of the&s;e Fellows were al|ways
waiting in my Antichamber, with their Securi|ties
ready drawn. I was tempted with the Ready,
&s;ome Farm or other went to Pot. I receiv'd with one
Hand, and paid it away with the other, to Lawyers;
that, like &s;o many Hell hounds, were ready to devour
me. Then the Rogues would plead Poverty, and
Scarcity of Money, that always ended in receiving
Ninety for the Hundred After they had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
of my be&s;t Rents, they were able to &s;upply me with
my own Mony. But what was wor&s;e, when I look'd
into the Securities, there was no Clau&s;e of Redemp|tion.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bull.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No Clau&s;e of Redemption, &s;ay you; that's
hard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="23">
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>No great matter, for I cannot pay them.
They had got a wor&s;e Trick than that; the &s;ame
Man bought and Sold to him&s;elf, paid the Mony, and
gave the Acquittance: The &s;ame Man was Butcher
and Gra&s;ier, Brewer and Butler, Cook and Poulterer.
There is &s;omething &s;till wor&s;e than all this; there came
twenty Bills upon me at once, which I had given Mo|ny
to di&s;charge; I was like to be pull'd to Pieces, by
Brewer, Butcher, and Baker, even my Herb-Woman
dun'd me as I went along the Streets (thanks to my
Friend Sir <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ger,</HI> el&s;e I mu&s;t have gone to Goal). When
I askd the meaning of this, I was told, the Mony went
<HI>to the Lawyers</HI>; Coun&s;el won't tick, Sir; <HI>Hocus</HI> was
urging; my Book-keeper &s;at Sotting all Day, playing
at Purt, and All-fours: In &s;hort, by griping U&s;urers,
devouring Lawyers, and negligent Servants, I am
brought to this pa&s;s.</P>

<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, yet con&s;ider my Circum&s;tances, my
Honour was engag'd, and I did not know how to get out;
be&s;ides, I was for Five Years often Drunk, always mud|dled,
they carried me from Tavern to Tavern, to Ale|hou&s;es
and Brandy-&s;hops, brought me acquainted with
&s;uch &s;trange Dogs: <HI>There goes the prittie&s;t Fellow in the

There's another can pick you up Witne&s;&s;es. Serjeant &s;uch a

I &s;hould have retain'd every &s;ingle Per&s;on within the
Inns of Court. The Night after a Trial, I treated
the Lawyers, their Wives and Daughters, with Fid|dles,
Hautboys, Drums and Trumpets. I was always
hot-headed; then they plac&punc;d me in the middle, the
Attorneys and their Clerks dancing about me, hoop|ing
and hallowing, <HI>Long live</HI> John Bull, <HI>the Glory and
Support of the Law!</HI></P>

<P>Really, Husband, you went through a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the things that fir&s;t alarm'd me
was, that they &s;hew'd a Spite again&s;t my poor Old
Mother; <Q REND="inline">Lord (quoth I) what makes you &s;o Jealous
<PB REF="24">
of a poor, old, innocent Gentlewoman, that minds
only her Prayers, and her Practice of Piety, &s;he
never meddles in any of your Concerns? Foh (&s;ay
they) to &s;ee a hand&s;ome&punc; brisk, genteel&punc; young Fel|low,
&s;o much govern'd by a doating old Woman;
why don't yo and &s;uck the Bubby? Do you con&s;ider
&s;he keeps you of a good Jointure? &s;he has the be&s;t of
your E&s;tate &s;ettled upon her for Rent-Charge: Hang
her, old Thief, turn her out of Doors, &s;eize her Lands,
and let her go to Law if &s;he dares. Soft and fair,
Gentlemen (quoth I) my Mother's my Mother, our
Family are not of an unnatural Temper. Tho I
don't take all her Advice, I won't &s;eize her Jointure;
long may &s;he enjoy it, good Woman, I don't grudge
it her: She allows me now and then a Brace of Hun|dreds
for my Law-Suit; that's pretty fair.</Q> About
this time the old Gentlewoman fell ill of an odd &s;ort
of a Di&s;temper; it began with a Coldne&s;s and Numb|ne&s;s
in her Limbs, which by degrees affected the Nerves
(I think the Phy&s;icians call them) &s;eiz'd the Brain,
and at la&s;t ended in a Lethargy. It betray'd it &s;elf
at fir&s;t in a &s;ort of Indifference and Carele&s;ne&s;s in all
her Actions, Coldne&s;s to her be&s;t Friends, and an A|ver&s;ion
to &s;tir or go about the common Offices of Life.
She that was the cleanlie&s;t Creature in the World, ne|ver
&s;hrunk now if you &s;et a Clo&s;e-&s;tool under her No&s;e.
She that would &s;ometimes rattle off her Servants pretty
&s;harply, now if &s;he &s;aw them drink, or heard them talk
profanely, never took any notice of it. In&s;tead of her
u&s;ual Charities to de&s;erving Per&s;ons, &s;he threw away
her Money upon roaring &s;wearing Bullies, and randy
Beggars, that went about the Streets. <HI>What is the mat|ter

knew little of the Matter, for when I enquir'd about

call'd in; but, as u&s;ual upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, they
differ'd &s;trangely at the Con&s;ultation. At la&s;t they
divided into two Parties, one &s;ided with <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th,</HI>

&s;o far as to &s;ay the Old Woman was mad, and nothing
would do better than a little Corporal Correction.

came into the Room with a good deal of Concern, and
ask'd them what they thought of my Mother? <HI>In no

of the Phy&s;icians de&s;ir'd I would take my Si&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI>
into the Hou&s;e to Nur&s;e her, but the Old Gentlewoman
would not hear of that. At la&s;t one Phy&s;ician ask'd
if the Lady had ever been us'd to take <HI>Laudanum</HI>; her
Maid an&s;wer'd, not that &s;he knew; that indeed there
was a <HI>High German</HI> Livery-Man of hers, one <HI>Van Pt&s;|chirn&s;ooker,</HI>
that gave her a &s;ort of a Quack Powder.

<P>I did indeed, and di&s;cover'd a great My|&s;tery
of Iniquity. The Witne&s;&s;es made Oath, That they
had heard &s;ome of the Livery-men frequently railing at
their Mi&s;tre&s;s. <Q REND="inline">They &s;aid, She was a trouble&s;ome
fiddle faddle old Woman, and &s;o ceremonious that
there was no bearing of her. They were &s;o plagu'd
with bowing and cringing as they went in and out of
the Room, that their Backs ach'd; &s;he us'd to &s;cold
at one for his dirty Shoes, at another for his grea&s;ie
Hair, and not combing his Head: Then &s;he was &s;o
pa&s;&s;ionate and fiery in her Temper, that there was no
living with her; &s;he wanted &s;omething to &s;weeten
her Blood; that they never had a quiet Night's re&s;t,

were often overheard among the Livery-men,

one time he pretended to be &s;eized with the
Gout in his right Knee; then he got a great Cold

Water, for fear of catching an Ague. <HI>John</HI> would take

When they were come to the Salutation, <HI>John</HI> conclu|ded
all was &s;ure then, and that he &s;hou'd be troubled

&s;peak. <HI>John Bull.</HI> Shall I &s;erve <HI>Philip Baboon</HI> with
<PB REF="30">
Broad cloth, and accept of the Compo&s;ition that he
offers, with the Liberty of his Parks and Fi&s;hponds?
Then <HI>Nic.</HI> roar'd like a Bull, O, o, o, o! If thou wilt not let me have them, wilt thou take
them thy &s;elf? Then <HI>Nic.</HI> grin'd, cackled and laugh'd,
till he was like to kill him&s;elf, and &s;eem'd to be &s;o
pleas'd, that he fell a frisking and dancing about the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">oom. <HI>John Bull. Shall I leave all this Matter to thy
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">anagement,</HI> Nic. <HI>and go about my Bu&s;ine&s;s?</HI> Then <HI>Nic.</HI>
got up a Gla&s;s, and drank to <HI>John,</HI> &s;haking him by the
Hand till he had like to have &s;hook his &s;houlder out of
Joint. <HI>John Bull. I under&s;tand thee,</HI> Nic. <HI>but I &s;hall
make thee &s;peak before I go.</HI> Then <HI>Nic.</HI> put his Finger in
his Cheek, and made him cry <HI>Buck,</HI> which was as much
as to &s;ay, I care not a Farthing for thee. <HI>John Bull.
I have done</HI> Nic. <HI>If thou wilt not &s;peak, I'll make my own
Terms with old</HI> Lewis <HI>here.</HI> Then <HI>Nic</HI> loll&punc;d out his
Tongue, and turn'd up his Bumm to him; which was
as much as to &s;ay, Ki&s;s <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>John</HI> perceiving that <HI>Frog</HI>
would not &s;peak, turns to old <HI>Lewis: Since we cannot
make this obstinate Fellow &s;peak,</HI> Lewis <HI>pray conde&s;cend a
little to his Humour, and &s;et down thy meaning upon Paper,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> may an&s;wer it in another Scrap. I am infinitely
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (quoth <HI>Lewis</HI>) <HI>that it happens &s;o unfortunately; for
playing a little at Cudgels t'other Day, a Fellow has given
me &s;uch a Rap over the Right Arm, that I am quite Lame:
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> have lo&s;t the U&s;e of my Forefinger and Thumb, &s;o that I

what you can do with your Left Hand.</HI> Lewis. <HI>That's
impo&s;&s;ible; it will make &s;uch a Scrawl, that it will not be
legible.</HI> As they were talking of this Matter, in came
E&s;quire <HI>South</HI> all dre&s;t up in Feathers and Ribbons,
&s;tark &s;taring mad, brandi&s;hing his Sword, as if he

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> for the grand E&s;quire of the World! the Flower of

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was pretty &s;trong fi&s;ted, gave him &s;uch a Squeeze,
<PB REF="31">
as made his Eyes Water. He went on &s;till in his mad
Pranks; <HI>When I am Lord of the Univer&s;e, the sun &s;hall
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and adore me! Thou,</HI> Frog, <HI>&s;halt be my Bailiff;
Lewis my Taylor, and thou,</HI> John Bull<HI>, &s;halt be my Fool!</HI>
All this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Frog</HI> laugh&punc;d in his Sleeve, gave the
E&s;quire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Noggan of Brandy, and clap&punc;d him on
the Back which made him ten times madder. Poor
<HI>John</HI> &s;tood in amaze, talking thus to him&s;elf: <HI>Well</HI>
John thou art got into rare Company! One has a dumb De|vil&punc;
t'other a mad Devil, and the third a Spirit of Infir|mity.
An hone&s;t Man has a fine time on&punc;t among&s;t &s;uch
Rogues. What art thou asking of them after all? Some
mighty Boon one would think! Only to &s;it quietly at thy own
Fire&s;ide. 'Sdeath, what have I to do with &s;uch Fellows!
John Bull <HI>after all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Lo&s;&s;es and Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es can live better
without them, than they can without him. Would to God
I liv'd a thou&s;and Leagues off them: But the Devil's in't:</HI>
John Bull <HI>is in, and</HI> John Bull <HI>mu&s;t get out as well as be
can.</HI> As he was talking to him&s;elf, he ob&s;erv&punc;d <HI>Frog</HI>
and <HI>Old Lewis</HI> edgng towards one another to Whi&s;per;
&s;o that <HI>John</HI> was forced to &s;it with his Arms a-kimbo,
to keep them a&s;under. Some People advis'd <HI>John</HI> to
Blood <HI>Frog</HI> under the Ton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">ue, or take away his Bread
and Butter, which would certainly make him &s;peak;
to give E&s;quire <HI>South</HI> Hellebore; as for <HI>Lewis,</HI> &s;ome
were for emollient Poltass, others for opening his
Arm with an Inci&s;ion knife.</P>
<P>I could not obtain from Sir <HI>Humphry,</HI> at this time,
a Copy of <HI>John</HI>&punc;s Letter, which he &s;ent to his Nephew
by the young <HI>Necromancer</HI>; wherein he advi&s;es him
not to eat Butter, Ham, and drink Old Hock in a
Morning, with the E&s;quire and <HI>Frog,</HI> for fear of giving
him a &s;our Breath.</P>
