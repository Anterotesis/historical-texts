<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN fir&s;t Willoughby arrived in
London, he had endeavoured to bring him|&s;elf
to a re&s;olution of &s;eeing Cele&s;tina; but
her ab&s;ence at that time on a tour of plea|&s;ure,
and the a&s;&s;urances he received that
&s;he was engaged to Montague Thorold,
not only diverted him from that intention,
but gave his &s;i&s;ter both time and opportu|nity
to repre&s;ent her as neither wanting or
wi&s;hing for that attention, which he thought
he &s;hould, as a friend, &s;hew her. The&s;e
in&s;inuations had gradually their effect: not
however in curing that invincible tender|ness
<PB N="2" REF="4">
he always felt for her, but in mingling
with it &s;o much bitterne&s;s that his life be|came
more than ever wretched. The acci|dentally
meeting Cele&s;tina at an a&s;&s;embly,
gay, unconcerned, and, as he believed,
forgetting her former attachment to him in
her new preference to Montague Thorold;
the &s;econd meeting, which happened at the
opera; and ev&eacute;ry thing that he heard both
from his &s;i&s;ter and in general conver&s;ation
where Cele&s;tina was mentioned, all &s;erved
to confirm this idea; while the letter which
would have undeceived him, never reached
his hands. It was left with Lady Moly|neux;
who, determined as &s;he was to im|pede
every advance towards a reconciliation
between her brother and Cele&s;tina, made
no &s;cruple, on hearing from whom it came,
to open, read, and, after &s;ome con&s;ideration,
to deftroy it.</P>
<P>Of the apparent neglect, therefore, which
Cele&s;tina imputed to Willoughby, he had
accu&s;ed <HI>ber;</HI> and thought, that if &s;he had
not determined to connect her&s;elf with
<PB N="3" REF="5">
Montague Thorold without any attention
to his wi&s;hes or reliance on his regard, &s;he
would have written to or &s;ent to him: while
his neglect of a letter by which &s;he thought
&s;he &s;hould awaken all the tenderne&s;s of
friend&s;hip which &s;he hoped he &s;till retained
for her, and the angry and di&s;dainful looks
with which he had twice met her, wounded
both her affection and her pride. Thus,
by the treachery of Lady Molyneux, all
commerce even of civility was at an end
between them; and &s;uch was the &s;ituation
of Willoughby, when the Ca&s;tlenorths ar|rived
in London from Italy.</P>
<P>Embarra&s;&s;ed more and more in his af|fairs,
and on the point of being over|whelmed
with pecuniary di&s;tre&s;s, it was more
than time that he &s;hould determine what to
do; and this determination, the return of
the Ca&s;tlenorths to England was intended
to ha&s;ten.</P>
<P>Always believing that to the artifices of
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth he had owed his being
compelled to quit Cele&s;tina, and &s;till hoping
<PB N="4" REF="6">
to detect tho&s;e artifices, he had, by fre|quent
vi&s;its at his uncle's, and by a &s;ort of
tacit and reluctant acquie&s;cence in many of
his plans, given Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman great
rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he intended fulfilling
his original engagement with her: yet now
that he &s;aw he mu&s;t either continue to act
what he could not but feel was a di&s;ho|nourable
and di&s;ingenuous part, or break
with his uncle entirely, his unea&s;ine&s;s be|came
more in&s;upportable. The tortures
which he had felt in ob&s;erving the favour
Cele&s;tina had &s;hewn to Montague Thorold,
by whi&s;pering and laughing with him, gave
him a cruel foreta&s;te of what he &s;hould &s;uf|fer
were he to &s;ee her married to him; yet
his rea&s;on, whenever he was calm enough
to li&s;ten to it, told him how ab&s;urd, how
improper it was, to indulge &s;uch &s;en&s;ations
of angui&s;h and regret; &s;ince, if the relation|&s;hip
which had been hinted at did really
&s;ub&s;i&s;t between them, he could never take
any other part in regard to her than a
friendly and fraternal concern in her happi|ne&s;s;
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and &s;ince the age, family, and circum|&s;tances
of Montague Thorold were all with|out
objection, he ought, if &s;he believed
&s;uch an alliance would make her happy,
not only to rejoice in it but promote it.</P>
<P>From this, however, his heart ab&s;olutely
revolted; and all he could prevail upon
him&s;elf to think of was, to make for Cele&s;|tina
&s;ome more ample provi&s;ion if he was
once convinced of their relation&s;hip, and to
wi&s;h her happy: for to &s;ee her happy, when
another was to be the object of her love,
he found would be to him the cruelle&s;t pu|ni&s;hment
that Fate could inflict.</P>
<P>Sometimes he thought, that &s;ince every
other woman on earth was indifferent to
him, he ought to learn to approve of Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, of who&s;e apparently en|crea&s;ing
affection towards him he could not
be in&s;en&s;ible. But love was never yet the
effect of effort; and while he compared her,
with all her laboured accompli&s;hments, to
Cele&s;tina, he found too certainly that he
never could love her, and that with &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="8">
&s;entiments to promi&s;e it, was an unworthy
pro&s;titution of his honour.</P>
<P>His coldne&s;s, however, and vi&s;ible re|luctance,
di&s;couraged none of the other
parties who de&s;ired this marriage: and
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, with all that pride
which her birth, her fortune, and the exalted
idea of her own merit, gave her, &s;eemed to
be, either from her affection to Willough|by
or &s;ome other cau&s;e, content to receive
his hand with the hope of afterwards win|ning
his heart. Convinced that he had no
attachment but to Cele&s;tina, and certain
that the impediments between them mu&s;t
effectually prevent his ever again thinking
of her with the fond partiality he had done,
&s;he &s;eemed very ea&s;y as to his indifference
towards her&s;elf; fore&s;eeing, perhaps, that
their lives would be &s;uch after they were
married as would very &s;oon produce it, if
they did not &s;et out with it: or, to judge
more candidly, &s;he might think with pride
and plea&s;ure of conquering, as his wife, that
<PB N="7" REF="9">
coldne&s;s to which, as his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he could
not be in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Lord Ca&s;tlenorth had &s;o determined a
predilection for the match, which the diffi|culties
he had met with had by no means
abated, that he would not &s;ee any thing that
appeared inimical to this his darling &s;cheme.
His great object was&mdash;and he forgot his
infirmities as he pur&s;ued it&mdash;to procure for
Willoughby the rever&s;ion of all his titles,
and, to change his name to Fitz-Hayman.
This he found would be attended with no
great difficulty; and now, whenever he &s;aw
his nephew, he enumerated all the &s;pecies
of &s;atisfaction which in his opinion would
attend the&s;e acquirements, dwelling with
great delight on the circum&s;tance of the
family arms remaining unchanged; though
he offered to quarter tho&s;e of Willoughby,
if their owner found any reluctance in
parting with them entirely.</P>
<P>From the&s;e harangues, which nothing
could for a moment render intere&s;ting to
Willoughby, <HI>his</HI> imagination was often quite
<PB N="8" REF="10">
ab&s;ent, and &s;led after Cele&s;tina, whom it
repre&s;ented as making the felicity of Mon|tague
Thorold, and enjoying with him that
life of elegant and literary retirement, which
he had him&s;elf fondly hoped to &s;hare with
her. Frequently, when his uncle was
talking to him of his ance&s;tor, Reginald
Fitz-Hayman, who in the reign of Hen|ry
IV. was &s;lain by the celebrated Hot&s;pur,
then in rebellion, after having twice un|hor&s;ed
him, de&s;cribing the circum&s;tances
of the combat, and &s;till more minutely
the bearings thereupon granted in addition
to their former coat, Willoughby, far from
attending to him, was meditating on &s;ome
walk he had taken with Cele&s;tina during their
&s;hort happine&s;s at Alve&s;tone the preceding
&s;pring; on the remarks &s;he had made, and
the improvements &s;he had &s;ugge&s;ted; and
having no idea of what his uncle was talk|ing
about, only under &s;tanding by his tone
when he ended a period, he &s;aid&mdash;"To be
&s;ure"&mdash;"Oh certainly"&mdash;"Very great"&mdash;"Undoubtedly"&mdash;without
knowing or car|ing
<PB N="9" REF="11">
whether the&s;e words were well placed:
while Lord Ca&s;tlenorth was too much de|lighted
with the plea&s;ure of hearing him&s;elf
talk on his favourite topic, to remark, that
Willoughby knew not a &s;yllable of what he
was &s;aying; and the latter had really ac|quired
&s;uch a habit of inattention to tho&s;e
&s;ubjects about which his uncle paraded,
that he not unfrequently had, in appear|ance,
a&s;&s;ented to plans relative to his for|tune,
and his re&s;idence after his marriage,
when in reality he had not, on the di&s;cour&s;e
to which he &s;eemed to li&s;ten, formed any
one idea.</P>
<P>A few days only pa&s;&s;ed in this manner
after the return of the Ca&s;tlenorths to Eng|land,
before the extreme pain he felt, the
&s;econd time of &s;eeing Cele&s;tina in public,
made him &s;en&s;ible of his inability to conti|nue
long in this undecided and wretched
&s;tate. From mere acquie&s;cence in mi&s;ery,
or rather from an hope to e&s;cape from it by
detecting Lady Ca&s;tlenorth's &s;chemes, he
had become in&s;en&s;ibly more deeply entan|gled
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in them: and he now began to accu&s;e
him&s;elf of very unju&s;tifiable conduct; &s;ince
not all the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances of his
fortune, not the certainty of Cele&s;tina's be|ing
lo&s;t to him, nor the plea&s;ure of &s;aving
his paternal e&s;tate, and particularly Alve&s;|tone,
which, after Cele&s;tina, had always
been his fir&s;t object, could, on a &s;trict ex|amination
of his own heart, lead him to
form a &s;erious wi&s;h of becoming the hu&s;|band
of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman: and he was
con&s;cious that every part of his behaviour
that had rai&s;ed contrary expectations, was
owing rather to his de&s;pair of obtaining one
woman than to his wi&s;h of being united to
another.</P>
<P>His mind was now in &s;uch a &s;tate of con|tinual
debate and perplexity, that nothing
had the power a moment to amu&s;e or plea&s;e
him. His &s;i&s;ter, without an heart her&s;elf,
had no notion of the corro&s;ive &s;en&s;ations
that preyed on his; his health, though far
from being re&s;tored, was &s;uch as no longer
offered her any pro&s;pect of becoming the
<PB N="11" REF="13">
heire&s;s to what family property was left;
and &s;ince her brother did live, her wi&s;h was
to have him live in &s;plendour, graced with
the happine&s;s of nobility, and reflecting
honour on her by his affluence and pro&s;|perity.
Her di&s;like of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth
and her daughter was long &s;ince loft in the
more inveterate di&s;like &s;he had conceived
again&s;t Cele&s;tina, &s;ince &s;he had been &s;o
much &s;een in good company in London,
and &s;o much celebrated for her beauty:
&s;he always therefore affected to con&s;ider his
marriage with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman as a &s;et|tled
thing; and from the moment of the
Ca&s;tlenorths return to England, &s;he joined,
with more zeal than her &s;elfi&s;h indolence
u&s;ually permitted her to feel for any thing,
in promoting it.</P>
<P>Thus be&s;et by his family, and on the
other hand harra&s;&s;ed by the encrea&s;ing cla|mours
of his creditors, who offered him only
the fad alternative of felling Alve&s;tone, and
who&s;e impatience was fomented by the
artful management of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
Willoughby for &s;ome litle time lingered
and he&s;itated: now thought that he ought
to marry, when &s;uch advantages were to
be acquired by it, now recoiled from the
dreadful idea of pa&s;&s;ing his life with a wo|man
who was indifferent to him, and whom
he doubted whether he could ever learn to
love. Even in the &s;ymptoms of her regard
for him, which were unequivocal enough,
there was &s;omething which rather di&s;gu&s;ted
than flattered him; and when he thought
how different were their minds, their tim|pers,
and their pur&s;uits, no earthly con&s;i|deration
&s;eemed to have &s;ufficient weight
with, him, to make him re&s;olve on putting
on a yoke &s;o unea&s;y to his imagination.</P>
<P>The repeated &s;ight of Cele&s;tina made all
his wounds bleed afre&s;h. He found, that
neither the &s;u&s;picions of their relation&s;hip,
or what he thought the certainty of her
alienation from him, were &s;trong enough
to counteract the effect of the long rooted
affection he felt for her: but he believed
that if those &s;u&s;picions once amounted to a
<PB N="13" REF="15">
certainty&mdash;if once he was thoroughly con|vinced
Cele&s;tina was his &s;i&s;ter, he &s;hould
learn to conquer every other &s;entiment in
regard to her but what he might with ho|nour
indulge.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, and becau&s;e he found
&s;ome &s;atisfaction in the delay this journey
would give him a pretence for, and thought
that mere change of place would afford
him &s;ome relief, he determined to &s;et out
in &s;earch of that &s;ervant, Hannah Bi&s;coe,
to whom he had obtained a direction in
Italy, and whom he had been detained
from vi&s;iting partly by his ill &s;tate of health
and partly by the artifices of Lady Moly|neux.</P>
<P>After &s;he and Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had met,
however, her oppo&s;ition to this journey
was withdrawn; and he &s;et out on hor&s;e|back,
attended only by his old &s;ervant
Farnham, intending to reach the village to
which he was directed, and which was on the
borders of Lanca&s;hire, by ea&s;y journies.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, to whom he had
&s;aid that every con&s;ideration urged him to
a complete developement of the my&s;tery
now that it &s;eemed to be in his power, &s;aw
him depart with an appearance of reluc|tance;
but Willoughby had &s;een her, ever
&s;ince her arrival in England, making par|ties
for public places without him, if he
happened not to be able or di&s;po&s;ed to go;
and found, that during his ab&s;ence &s;he
would proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;e of amu&s;ement;
and that &s;he and her mother would
find no inconvenience for want of an e&s;cort,
as they had brought over with them an Iri&s;h
officer, who had been in the &s;ervice of
France,- with whom Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had
contracted an intimacy a few years before
in Italy, which in their la&s;t journey to the
Continent had been renewed and encrea&s;ed:
in con&s;equence of which, Captain Cava|naugh
had accompanied them to London,
where he had apartments in the hou&s;e, and
was become one of the family. At all
places of public re&s;ort he attended on Lady
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Ca&s;tlenorth; &s;at by her at the upper end of
the table to carve for her; and acted as a
&s;ort of gentleman u&s;her to the mother,
while he treated the daughter with the mo&s;t
profound reverence and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>This gentleman was three or four and
thirty. His face was hand&s;ome, and his
figure, though large, uncommonly fine.
He had &s;een a great deal of &s;ervice and of
the world; &s;poke all European languages
except Engli&s;h, well, and with all the ani|mation
of a Frenchman, had enough of the
national character &s;till about him, to mark
him for an Iri&s;hman.</P>
<P>He was, indeed, &s;ufficiently proud of
his country, and piqued him&s;elf on being
de&s;cended from the kings of Lein&s;ter; and
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, to whom he contrived to
render him&s;elf agreeable by a patient at|tention
to long &s;tories, by his knowledge
of genealogy, by picking up for him old
books of heraldry, and under&s;tanding the
difference between a pale lozengy, and a
pale engrailed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Terms u&s;ed in heraldry.</NOTE>; and affixing &s;ome impor|tance
<PB N="16" REF="18">
to the enquiry, whether one of the
quarterings of the arms of Fitz-Hayman,
&s;hould in &s;trictne&s;s be on field argent, a
boar's head, couped gules, or couped Or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Terms u&s;ed in heraldry.</NOTE>.
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, among other doubts on
this and equally important &s;ubjects with
which he amu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;ometimes con|&s;idered
whether the genealogy of Captain
Cavanaugh might not be traced back in
Ireland a generation or two beyond his own
in Normandy, a circum&s;tance which ex|cited
his re&s;pect, and gave, in his opinion,
weight and value to tho&s;e qualities by which
the Captain contrived to render him&s;elf,
throughout the family, &s;o very acceptable.</P>
<P>Willoughby had &s;een him with them
once or twice abroad, but had not then
particularly noticed him among that croud
of all nations and de&s;criptions which Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth contrived to collect around her
there. He now &s;aw him, not without a
&s;light degree of &s;urpri&s;e, dome&s;ticated in
the family; but his whole attention &s;eemed
to be given to the elder members of it; and
<PB N="17" REF="19">
he hardly ever &s;poke to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
who, when Willoughby one day took oc|ca&s;ion
to remark that he was on a footing
of greater intimacy than formerly, an&s;wered,
with &s;omething like a carele&s;s &s;neer&mdash;"Oh
you know that Cavanaugh has long been
my mother's great favourite."</P>
<P>In the &s;ocieties of London, however,
this intimacy became the &s;ubject of &s;ome
malicious comments; and Lady Moly|neux,
who &s;eldom let any thing of that
&s;ort e&s;cape her, could not forbear indulg|ing
her&s;elf in &s;ome remarks on Lady Ca&s;|tlenorth's
friend&s;hip, even before her bro|ther,
who gave, however, &s;o little atten|tion
to what he heard, that before he reached
the end of his fir&s;t day's journey he had
forgot that &s;uch a per&s;on as the Captain
exi&s;ted, as he would probably have forgot|ten
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth her&s;elf, had not the
purpo&s;e of his pre&s;ent journey, and all the
tran&s;actions of the la&s;t twelve months of his
life, brought her and the con&s;equences of
<PB N="18" REF="20">
tho&s;e tran&s;actions too forcibly to his me|mory.</P>
<P>While Willoughby was thus on his jour|ney,
the di&s;quiet and unhappine&s;s of Cele&s;|tina,
though &s;he was compelled to appear
to conquer them, were but little abated.</P>
<P>Nothing, in the opinion of Lady Hora|tia,
contributed &s;o much to wean the mind
from indulging &s;orrow or encouraging
weakne&s;s, as variety of company and con|tinual
di&s;&s;ipation; and in the&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding
her reluctance, Cele&s;tina was con|tinually
engaged. She now more than ever
regretted that &s;he had relinqui&s;hed that
plan of life which &s;he had fixed upon when
fir&s;t left, by the death of Mrs. Willoughby,
to &s;eek a new one. The quiet farm hou&s;e
in Devon&s;hire where Cathcatt and Je&s;&s;y
lived, the tender attention &s;he &s;hould be
there &s;ure to meet with, the not unplea&s;ing
melancholy of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, and the
perfect &s;eclu&s;ion &s;he might there enjoy from
a world where nothing gave her any real
plea&s;ure, were ideas which were now al|ways
<PB N="19" REF="21">
returning to her mind with new
power. There, &s;he thought her &s;ad heart
might be laid open to the pitying &s;ympa|thy
of her fir&s;t and mo&s;t beloved friend,
and find &s;ome &s;atisfaction amid&s;t it's own
di&s;appointments in witne&s;&s;ing the happine&s;s
of that friend, to which &s;he had been &s;o,
greatly in&s;trumental; and there &s;he might
wander whole days among the fields and
cop&s;es, indulging her&s;elf in repeating the
name of Willoughby, in thinking of him,
in reading again tho&s;e books they had read
together, painting the plants he admired,
and compo&s;ing melancholy ver&s;es, which
above every other occupation &s;oothed her
mind. But when &s;he had repre&s;ented to
her&s;elf all the mournful plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould
in &s;uch a &s;ituation enjoy, and half determined
to gratify her&s;elf, the ingratitude of which
&s;he &s;hould be guilty towards Lady Horatia
de&s;troyed her re&s;olves; and alas! &s;he recol|lected
too, that at the farm of Je&s;&s;y &s;he &s;aw
from almo&s;t every field, and from &s;ome of
the windows of the hou&s;e, Alve&s;tone Park,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
where Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman would &s;oon be
mi&s;tre&s;s; the &s;ight &s;he thought &s;he could
not bear; and her mind turned with terror
from the idea of it. There were al&s;o very
&s;trong objections again&s;t her going into the
immediate neighbourhood of Montague
Thorold, if &s;he meant not to give him en|couragement;
and the&s;e con&s;iderations
adding to the impracticability of her quit|ting,
without better rea&s;ons than a mere wi&s;h
of retirement, &s;uch a generous protectre&s;s
as Lady Horatia, determined her to wean
her mind from an inclination &s;he could not
properly indulge, and to move on as well
as &s;he could in the weari&s;ome circle; till
the time arrived when Lady Horatia &s;et out
on her &s;ummer tour, which was to begin
by going to Matlock, from whence &s;he
was to go into Wales, and then end the
&s;ummer at Cheltenham.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our had been &s;o long ab&s;ent, that
Cele&s;tina began to hope his pride and re|&s;entment
had &s;ubdued every wi&s;h to pur&s;ue
her. In this, however, &s;he was mi&s;taken:
<PB N="21" REF="23">
a few days after the departure of Willough|by
he called, and was admitted. Lady
Horatia and Cele&s;tina, though neither of
them were plea&s;ed to &s;ee him, yet received
him with civility, and entered on common
topics, &s;uch as the occurrences of the day
afford; to the&s;e he appeared very inatten|tive,
and turning abruptly to Cele&s;tina, he
&s;aid&mdash;"Mi&s;s De Mornay, cannot I &s;peak
to you alone?"</P>
<P>She he&s;itated a moment, and then &s;aid&mdash;"I
believe, Mr. Vava&s;our, there is nothing
you can have to communicate to me, that
ought to be a &s;ecret to Lady Horatia How|ard."</P>
<P>"There is, Madam," returned he with
quickne&s;s, and appearing much di&s;plea&s;ed
with her apparent di&s;inclination to oblige

Lady Horatia now ro&s;e, and &s;aid&mdash;"My

left the room.</P>
<P>"Now, Madam," &s;aid Vava&s;our, as
&s;oon as &s;he had &s;hut the door&mdash;"now you
have no longer an excu&s;e to repul&s;e or deny
me: Willoughby a&s;&s;uredly quits you for
ever: and nothing ought, nothing &s;hall im|pede
my preten&s;ions. Emily&mdash;my poor
Emily her&s;elf&mdash;on who&s;e account I own to
you I have he&s;itated more than once, wi&s;hes
my &s;ucce&s;s, and bids me &s;ay, that convinced
my happine&s;s depends upon you, &s;he with|draws
every claim which &s;he had on my
heart, and be&s;eeches you to believe it is not
unworthy your acceptance."</P>
<P>"Emily, Sir?" cried Cele&s;tina in &s;ome
&s;urpri&s;e: "of whom do you &s;peak? and
how can a per&s;on to who&s;e very name I am
a &s;tranger, be likely in &s;uch a ca&s;e to influ|ence
me?"</P>
<P>"Don't affect," &s;aid he, "the ridiculous
prudery of di&s;claiming any knowledge of
<PB N="23" REF="25">
her, becau&s;e &s;he does not rank among tho&s;e
who are fal&s;ely called virtuous women: by
heaven &s;he has virtues that might redeem
the vices of half her &s;ex; not one in a thou|&s;and
of whom po&s;&s;e&s;s a twentieth part of
her worth."</P>
<P>"I mean not," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina,
mildly, "to di&s;pute her value, but only
to a&s;k on what preten&s;ion you urge to me
either the re&s;ignation or opinions of a per|&s;on
with whom I have no acquaintance."</P>
<P>"Why will you pretend not to know
her," re&s;umed he with redoubled impe|tuo&s;ity&mdash;"why
affect not to know that
Emily, who has lived with me almo&s;t twelve
months, is the &s;i&s;ter of your Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
and of that Cathcart whom Willough|by
picked up and placed as his &s;teward at
Alve&s;tone."</P>
<P>"I have heard there is &s;uch a per&s;on,"
&s;aid Cele&s;tina: "but I did not know &s;he
lived with you."</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;he has lived with me &s;ome time,
though I did not till lately know her fa|mily.
<PB N="24" REF="26">
Unworthy and di&s;graced as you may
think her, &s;he &s;hould at this moment have
been mi&s;tre&s;s of my hou&s;e and my fortune,
by what you would call legal claims, if I
had not, like a cur&s;ed fool as I am, taken
up a pa&s;&s;ion for you which I cannot get rid
of, and which my generous little girl not
only knows, but with di&s;intere&s;ted affection,
in&s;tead of trying to di&s;&s;uade me from it,
wi&s;hes me to &s;ucceed in. I have &s;ome|times
fancied, that your knowledge of my
attachment to her was in my way; and that
circum&s;tance, together with the eternal
my&s;tery that always hung over Willough|by's
intentions&mdash;in &s;hort, my hopes of be|ing
cured of a damned folly, by rea&s;on and
ab&s;ence, in&s;tead of matrimony, have alto|gether
made me refrain from vi&s;iting you
lately. But now I think, &s;ince George is
gone out of town and returns only to be
married to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, there is an
end of that; and for my experiment&mdash;cur&s;e
me if I believe it will do; and &s;o here
I am again, more in love and a greater

blockhead than ever. Don't, however,
mi&s;take me, Cele&s;tina: I will not, I can|not
bear to be tri&s;led with; nor will I &s;a|crifice
one hour, either to your coquetry or
to the ab&s;urd partiality which I &s;ometimes
u&s;ed to believe you had, for that whining,
&s;nivelling Montague Thorold. If there are
no other preten&s;ions than his in the way, I
&s;hall &s;oon know how to &s;ettle the matter."</P>
<P>"Really, Mr. Vava&s;our," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
as &s;oon as he would give her an opportunity
of &s;peaking, "your conduct and manners
are &s;o eccentric, that it is difficult to know
what to &s;ay to you, which you will not call
either prudery or coquetry, or impute to a
partiality for &s;ome other per&s;on. Permit
me, however, to tell you, with that &s;in|cerity
with which I have always &s;poke on
this &s;ubject, that I am &s;en&s;ible of the ho|nour
you do me, but that I never can ac|cept
it, even though my &s;ituation were to
be more humble than it is, and though
&s;uch a man as Mr. Montague Thorold had
never exi&s;ted."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">
"Oh! very well, Madam," cried Va|va&s;our,
impatiently interrupting her&mdash;"You
mu&s;t, however, allow me to a&s;k your ob|jections:
are they to my per&s;on? my fa|mily?
my fortune?"</P>
<P>"I have already &s;aid, Sir, that they are
all unexceptionable."</P>
<P>"Well, Madam, I mu&s;t then infer from
your refu&s;al, that you are engaged."</P>
<P>"No, Sir, that inference by no means
follows. Pardon me if I &s;ay, that notwith|&s;tanding
all the advantages you po&s;&s;e&s;s, it
is po&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on to decline the ho|nour
of your addre&s;&s;es without being en|gaged."</P>
<P>"However, Madam, do you or do
you not deny that &s;uch an engagement does
exi&s;t? Of that, I think, I have a right to
enquire."</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Sir, if I an&s;wer that it
does not &s;eem to me that you have any
right in the world to a&s;k that que&s;tion of
me."</P>
<P>"Well then, I &s;hall a&s;k it el&s;ewhere."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
"Where you have, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till le&s;s
right," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, alarmed at his vehe|mence.</P>
<P>"You are, however, very quick at un|der&s;tanding
to whom I allude."</P>
<P>"Certainly, after what you have ju&s;t
&s;aid, I cannot mi&s;take your meaning. You
allude to Mr. Montague Thorold."</P>
<P>"Damn him," cried Vava&s;our, ri&s;ing,
and &s;peaking with vehemence that made
her &s;hudder, "that puppy cro&s;&s;es me like
my evil genius. By any man at all worthy
of you, I might perhaps bear to be &s;up|planted;
but by &s;uch a &s;illy fellow as that&mdash;no,
damn it, there is no enduring it&mdash;cur&s;e
me if it does not make me frantic."</P>
<P>"Hear me then, Mr. Vava&s;our&mdash;hear
me for the la&s;t time&mdash;for I never will again
willingly expo&s;e my&s;elf to this &s;ort of treat|ment.
<HI>I am not</HI> engaged to Mr. Thorold:
it is not likely I ever &s;hall be engaged to
him; and farther, I again prote&s;t to you,
that did no &s;uch per&s;on exi&s;t it would make
no difference in the re&s;olution I have made
<PB N="28" REF="30">
never to li&s;ten to the offers with which you
honour me."</P>
<P>This declaration, repeated &s;o &s;trongly,
&s;erved but to inflame tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which
Cele&s;tina hoped it would repre&s;s, and piqued
his pride, without de&s;troying what he called
love. He walked backwards and forwards
in the room a moment or two, and &s;eemed
to be rea&s;oning with that extravagant
warmth of temper &s;he had complained of:
but his eyes and his manner expre&s;&s;ed
plainly what he forbore to utter. After a
while, he appeared to have conquered the
inclination he felt to give way to the rage
that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him; and &s;itting down by
her, he &s;oftened his voice as much as he
could, though it trembled through the va|riety
of emotions he felt, and endeavoured
to &s;peak calmly while he &s;aid&mdash;"Cele&s;tina,
if this be really the ca&s;e&mdash;if I may venture
to believe you, you will not &s;urely refu&s;e
to &s;atisfy me a little farther. I am not a
vain coxcomb: but I know that neither
my figure or my under&s;tanding are con|temptible;
<PB N="29" REF="31">
temptible; I have a very affluent fortune;
and I have an heart that, as you well know,
adores you. Willoughby cannot or will
not marry you; of that I think you can no
longer doubt. You &s;ay, that you are not
engaged to the young Doctor Thorold;
tell me then, what there is, that overba|lancing
&s;o many points in my favour, ren|ders
them all ineffectual."</P>
<P>"And I will tell you candidly, Mr.
Vava&s;our. My objections then are, to your
morals&mdash;to your principles: they may not
be, and I dare &s;ay are not, wor&s;e than tho&s;e
of other young men of fortune who have
equal opportunities of following their own
inclinations: but however that may be,
they are &s;uch as would inevitably make me
unhappy; and knowing that, it would be
extreme folly were any advantages which
affluence can offer to induce me to ri&s;k it."</P>
<P>"My morals!" cried Vava&s;our&mdash;"again
my morals!&mdash;and pray what part of what
you are plea&s;ed to call my morals is it that
gives you &s;o much offence?"</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
"All," an&s;wered &s;he. "Your manner
of life&mdash;your attachments&mdash;your connec|tions,
which you have ju&s;t acknowledged
you could not, without he&s;itation and re|luctance,
quit."</P>
<P>"Still you will mi&s;under&s;tand me. What
I &s;aid in regard to Emily &s;urely went to a
very different meaning. I told you, that
you are the only woman upon earth for
whom I would quit her; and the greater
my regard has been for her, &s;urely the
greater it makes out my attachment to you,
for whom I would relinqui&s;h her. By hea|ven!
I cannot tell how far my affection for
her might have carried me, if my pa&s;&s;ion
for you had not taken &s;o deep root in my
heart; and cur&s;e me, if amid&s;t it all I do
not &s;till love her dearly, and would give
half my e&s;tate to make her happy and re|e&s;tabli&s;h
her health; but poor dear girl&mdash;&s;he
will never, I am afraid, recover."</P>
<P>"If her illne&s;s is occa&s;ioned by her fears
of lo&s;ing you, Sir," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "re|move
at once the cau&s;e of it by thinking of
<PB N="31" REF="33">
me no more. If you love her as much as
you expre&s;s, &s;urely this cannot be difficult;
and why, feeling this attachment to a per|&s;on
whom you think &s;o de&s;erving of it,
&s;hould you, contrary to the dictates of rea|&s;on,
pur&s;ue one who never can return the
good opinion you entertain of her."</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e of my morals! Ridiculous
cant and fal&s;ehood. Don't I know that
women all like the very libertini&s;m they are
plea&s;ed outwardly to condemn? Don't I
know that the proude&s;t, the mo&s;t prudi&s;h
among ye, are flattered by the attention of
tho&s;e men who are called the greate&s;t rakes,
and that if any queer fellow &s;ets up to be a
moral man, ye all laugh at and de&s;pi&s;e
him. This &s;ort of &s;tuff about morals, you
have learned, I &s;uppo&s;e, either from old par|&s;on
Thorold, or this good motherly gentle|woman
you live with: but you, who have
&s;o much &s;en&s;e, cannot &s;eriou&s;ly per&s;i&s;t in
&s;uch methodi&s;tical cant; and as to any ob|jections
about Emily&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">
"Don't mi&s;take me, Mr. Vava&s;our. I
made no mention of her in the way of ob|jection."</P>
<P>"Well then," cried he, interrupting her,
"as to my morals in every other re&s;pect
they are really exemplary. I play, com|paratively,
very little; I don't drink a fifth
part &s;o much as half the people I live with;
and I reckon my&s;elf, upon the whole, a very
orderly, &s;ober fellow."</P>
<P>"By compari&s;on only," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
half &s;miling at his way of making out the account.</P>
<P>"Aye, by compari&s;on. Every thing in
this world is, you know, good or bad only
by compari&s;on. Come, come, Cele&s;tina, I
was willing enough to allow for your pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
in favour of George Willoughby,
but to any other I cannot, I will not &s;ub|mit;
nor will I allow any thing to this
damned prudery. I know my&s;elf worthy
of you, highly as I think of you. Yes, I
de&s;erve you, if it be only for my per&s;evering
<PB N="33" REF="35">
love; and by all that's good I will not be
denied."</P>
<P>"You really will, Sir," replied Cele&s;tina;
who, more and more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by his per&s;e|verance,
de&s;ired to put an end to it for ever
if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;"you really will; for I prote&s;t
to you that I never can give any other an|&s;wer
than I have already given, and I beg,
I entreat that you will de&s;i&s;t from a pur&s;uit
that can produce for you only mortification."</P>
<P>"May perdition &s;eize me if I do!" re|turned
he with renewed vehemence. "No!
if I peri&s;h in the attempt, I will per&s;evere!"
He was proceeding in this &s;train, when Lady
Horatia &s;ent to let Cele&s;tina know &s;he waited
for her to go out; and &s;he took the oppor|tunity
of ha&s;tening away, glad to be relieved
from a conver&s;ation &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; while
Vava&s;our, finding all attempts to detain her
ineffectual, left the hou&s;e in one of tho&s;e
paroxy&s;ms of pa&s;&s;ion, which di&s;appointment,
from his having never been u&s;ed to &s;ubmit
to it, always produced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be difficult to &s;ay, whether
Willoughby, wandering and &s;olitary among
the remote villages of York&s;hire, or Cele&s;|tina,
&s;urrounded in London by what the
world calls plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement, was the
mo&s;t internally wretched. Cele&s;tina's
la&s;t dialogue with Vava&s;our, had convinced
her that Willoughby no longer thought of
her even with that degree of friend&s;hip and
tenderne&s;s which he had &s;o often a&s;&s;ured
her nothing &s;hould de&s;troy: he was gone
out of town merely to prepare for his mar|riage;
and gone without deigning either
to &s;ee her or an&s;wer the letter &s;he had writ|ten
to him. There was, in &s;uch conduct,
&s;o much unkindne&s;s and inhumanity, that
&s;he began to hope her reflections on it would
<PB N="35" REF="37">
by degrees abate the angui&s;h &s;he now felt:
and &s;he li&s;tened to Lady Horatia, who con|tinually
&s;poke of it as an unequivocal proof
of Willoughby's want of an heart capable
of a generous and &s;teady attachment. To
Montague Thorold, however, (who now
again returned to town after an ab&s;ence on
bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome little time), &s;he could not
li&s;ten with &s;o much complacency as her
friend wi&s;hed; and &s;he repeatedly told him,
that the greate&s;t obligation he could confer
upon her would be to de&s;i&s;t from talking to
her of love. The certainty, however, there now
&s;eemed to be that Willoughby no
longer con&s;idered him&s;elf as intere&s;ted about
her; her po&s;itive rejection of Mr. Vava|&s;our,
and the encouragement given him by
Lady Horatia to per&s;evere, brought him
continually to the hou&s;e; where their morn|ing
parties of reading re-commenced; and
whenever they went out of an evening,
Montague Thorold was their attendant:
thus drinking intoxicating draughts of love,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
and indulging hope that it would finally be
&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Willoughby now found without difficulty
the per&s;on he &s;ought: and whether it was
that &s;he had her le&s;&s;on more completely, or
was permitted to &s;peak plainer of what &s;he
knew, &s;he an&s;wered all his enquiries in &s;uch
a way as &s;erved to perplex but not entirely
to affirm the que&s;tion, whether Cele&s;tina
was his mother's daughter. The woman
was, in her mind and ideas, one of the
lowe&s;t of the vulgar: yet her &s;implicity
&s;eemed to be affected; and all the proofs
which had been talked of did not amount
to her declaring that &s;he was pre&s;ent at the
birth of Cele&s;tina or could produce any po|&s;itive
evidence of it. She &s;poke principally
to the time when &s;he &s;aid the little girl was
at nur&s;e at Ken&s;ington; of, which &s;he related
a great many particulars that &s;taggered
Willoughby more than ever, without con|vincing
him: yet all the woman &s;aid, though
it was con&s;i&s;tent, had the air of having been
learned by rote; and there was about her a
<PB N="37" REF="39">
&s;ort of guarded cunning which &s;eemed to
have been acquired, or at lea&s;t improved
by long practice. Willoughby attempted
to di&s;cover whether &s;he had not received
money from Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, and to find
what were her pre&s;ent means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence:
but for the&s;e enquiries al&s;o &s;he &s;eemed pre|pared;
and gave at lea&s;t a plau&s;ible account
of a legacy left her by a great uncle, that
enabled her to live without &s;ervitude in her
native country, where &s;he boarded with a re|lation,
and affected great piety and &s;anctity.
She ble&s;&s;ed God, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he &s;corned
for the lucre of gain to belye any one, dead
or alive, much more her good mi&s;tre&s;s
who was gone: but truth was truth and &s;he
hoped, by the help of God, always to &s;peak
it plain and direct, without fee or reward:
"and as for Lady Ca&s;tlenorth," added &s;he,
"whom your honour thinks has paid me
for &s;peaking of this thing, pray con&s;ider,
your honour, wherein it could be u&s;eful to
my lady to put me upon &s;aying a fal&s;ity.
If I was ba&s;e enough to take money of my
<PB N="38" REF="40">
Lady for it, which to be certain I never
did, for what would that be, as your ho|nour
well knows, but &s;elling my immortal
&s;oul? and what good, as I may &s;ay, would
all the gold and diamonds in the world do
me, if my precious &s;oul was to peri&s;h be|cau&s;e
of them."</P>
<P>This cant, to which Willoughby li&s;tened
with continued patience, made him hope
that he &s;hould, in &s;ome in&s;tance or other,
detect her of incon&s;i&s;tency. But though he
&s;aw her repeatedly, and &s;et Farnham to
watch her &s;till more narrowly and to talk
the matter over with her as if in confidence,
&s;he was always &s;o guarded that no contra|diction
could be di&s;covered; and after wait|ing
near a week at the village, Willoughby
was compelled to give up every idea of cer|tainly
coming at the truth, and to return
towards London without being po&s;itively
&s;ure that Cele&s;tina was &s;o nearly related to
him; yet forced to allow that he could not,
in contradiction to all he had heard of a
child nur&s;ed in &s;ecret at Ken&s;ington, bring
<PB N="39" REF="41">
any &s;ort of evidence on which he ought to
rely that &s;he was not &s;o.</P>
<P>Sick at heart, and feeling too &s;en&s;ibly
that all his future life mu&s;t be unhappy, his
mind &s;unk in total de&s;pondence. Too cer|tain
it was, that under &s;uch circum&s;tances
he could not think of marrying Cele&s;tina:
yet he was unhappily con&s;cious that he
could not bear to think of her marrying
another. It was in vain he accu&s;ed him&s;elf
of &s;omething wor&s;e than folly. The mo|ment
his mind dwelt on that &s;ubject, he
found that folly irre&s;i&s;tible: and while he
determined that one of the fir&s;t things he
would do on his return &s;hould be to make a
provi&s;ion for Cele&s;tina out of his remaining
fortune, he &s;ickened in recollecting that
&s;uch a provi&s;ion would probably but facili|tate
her marriage with Montague Tho|rold&mdash;and
of Montague Thorold he could
not think with patience.</P>
<P>Of his own &s;ituation in regard to the fa|mily
of Fitz-Hayman, he thought with
equal bitterne&s;s. He was but too con&s;cious,
<PB N="40" REF="42">
that to obtain the information he wanted
from Hannah Bi&s;coe, which he had flattered
him&s;elf would turn out very differently, he
had renewed his attendance at the hou&s;e of
his uncle, and acted di&s;ingenuou&s;ly and un|like,
him&s;elf. However indifferent or aver&s;e
he was to his cou&s;in, his honour forbade
him any longer to trifle with tho&s;e &s;enti|ments
which &s;he evidently entertained in
his favour. What then &s;hould he do?
This que&s;tion came continually before him;
and was continually debated without his
being able to form any re&s;olution on which
he could for a moment re&s;t without pain.</P>
<P>He &s;ometimes thought, that &s;ince in
lo&s;ing the only woman whom he could
love, he had lo&s;t all that could render his
life happy, it was immaterial what became
of him; and that &s;ince he mu&s;t be mi&s;era|ble,
it might as well be in following as in
flying from what he &s;till thought was in
&s;ome degree a duty&mdash;completing the en|gagement
he had made to his mother on
her death bed. In doing this, he &s;hould
<PB N="41" REF="43">
gratify all his &s;urviving relations, and re|trieve
his e&s;tate, which he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e
&s;ell, as the mortgages upon it were ra|pidly
devouring it: and to do this was, as
he &s;ometimes tried to per&s;uade him&s;elf, to
pay a debt he owed his ance&s;tors. He had
been educated by his mother in high ideas
of the con&s;equence and re&s;pectability, not
only of her family but of that of his father;
but of the&s;e prejudices his natural good &s;en&s;e
had &s;uffered very little to remain; &s;o that
if he now endeavoured to recall them in
&s;upport of tho&s;e arguments which he ran
over in favour of his marriage, his under|&s;tanding
immediately revolted again&s;t them.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not-only retrieve," &s;aid he,
"but augment my fortune: not only &s;ave
Alve&s;tone, but add to my pre&s;ent e&s;tates
the family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of my mother, which
will otherwi&s;e become the property of &s;tran|gers:
the honours too &s;o long inherited by
her ance&s;tors will be mine."</P>
<P>He frequently made efforts to fix his
mind on the&s;e advantages; but the mo|ment
<PB N="42" REF="44">
he began &s;eriou&s;ly to inve&s;tigate their
value, he beheld them with contempt.</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried he. "My ance&s;|tors!
What is this fooli&s;h family pride, for
which I am meditating to &s;ell my freedom,
in acquie&s;cence with narrow prejudice? I
&s;hall have a large e&s;tate: but will it make
me happier in my&s;elf, or more re&s;pected by
tho&s;e who&s;e re&s;pect can afford me any plea|&s;ure?
I &s;hall be called "my Lord"&mdash;a
mighty &s;atisfaction truly! The vulgar&mdash;for
with &s;uch empty &s;ounds the vulgar only
are delighted&mdash;will bow low to my Lord|&s;hip,
and I &s;hall take place at county
meetings above the neighbouring E&s;quires
who are now my equals. I &s;hall have
a bauble called a coronet painted on my
coach doors and my hall chairs, and
&s;hall become one of the legi&s;lature,
qualified for it only by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
that bauble. Perhaps half a dozen or half
a hundred men and women of poor ambi|tion,
may court the notice and boa&s;t of the
acquaintance of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, who
would have let Mr. Willoughby remain
<PB N="43" REF="45">
unmole&s;ted by their kindne&s;s, and by &s;uch
friends my hou&s;e will be infe&s;ted and my
lei&s;ure de&s;troyed. But I &s;hall go to Court,
and be named as having appeared at the
drawing room; that will be very delectable
certainly: and my wife's fine cloaths will
be de&s;cribed at full length, and the ta&s;te of
my equipage be commended in all the
new&s;papers. It will be there told of me,
that I am gone to this or that of my coun|try
hou&s;es; and my &s;ix bays, or greys, or
blacks, will be celebrated in Hyde Park, or
be con&s;picuous in the roads within twenty
miles of London; while a thou&s;and in&s;ig|nificant
in&s;ipid beings, whom I neither
know nor de&s;ire to know, &s;hall &s;ay "what
a beautiful carriage, what a well appointed
equipage is that of my Lord Ca&s;tlenorth."
All this felicity in the aggregate, and I
know of no more that belongs to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a title, is certainly well worth the
&s;acrifice I &s;hall make to obtain it; and my
ance&s;tors, "from their airy clouds," will be
<PB N="44" REF="46">
infinitely delighted by the glory of their de|&s;cendant.</P>
<P>But what will that de&s;cendant be in
reality? a mercenary, a mi&s;erable wretch:
condemned to pa&s;s his life with a woman,
whom, if he does not loath, he does not
love; to feel him&s;elf a purcha&s;ed hu&s;band;
and to have &s;old, in &s;ad exchange, man's
be&s;t birth right, freedom, for a me&s;s of
pottage.</P>
<P>To &s;uch &s;oliloquies as the&s;e, &s;ucceeded
determinations to carry no farther any &s;em|blance
of attention to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman;
but to go even from his pre&s;ent journey and
without pa&s;&s;ing through London, imme|diately
abroad.</P>
<P>To a mind unable to re&s;i&s;t mi&s;ery, there
frequently appears a po&s;&s;ibility of flying
from it; and while Willoughby dreaded
the thoughts of returning to London, he
fancied that if he could cro&s;s over from Hull
to the north of Europe, he &s;hould leave
&s;ome part of his pre&s;ent unhappine&s;s be|hind
him. Un&s;ettled and unhappy as he
<PB N="45" REF="47">
was, the&s;e debates with him&s;elf, the&s;e vague
plans of quitting every thing and becoming
a wanderer on earth, became more u&s;ual with him:
but &s;till he decided on nothing.
The idea of being compelled to &s;ell Alve&s;|tone
was the only one, however, that had
great weight with him. To think that the
place to which he had been &s;o fondly at|tached
&s;hould become the property of &s;ome
up&s;tart man of &s;udden fortune, was accom|panied
by a &s;en&s;ation of acute unea&s;ine&s;s.
He imagined, tho&s;e beautiful woods, the
growth of centuries, fallen in compliance
with the improving ta&s;te of a broker or a
warehou&s;eman; the park ploughed up to
be converted into farms; and the elegant
&s;implicity of his hou&s;e and his grounds, de|&s;troyed
by gothic windows or Chine&s;e orna|ments;
the &s;hrubberies where he had wan|dered
with Cele&s;tina, that turf, where he
had ran by her &s;ide when &s;he was learning
to ride, and where they u&s;ed to walk arm
in arm together; that hou&s;e, where he had
hoped &s;he would pre&s;ide, and grace &s;o
<PB N="46" REF="48">
lovely a &s;cene with a mi&s;tre&s;s yet more
lovely; all, all were to become the pro|perty
of another! and the very name of
Willoughby, and what was yet more pain|ful,
the name of Cele&s;tina, &s;hould never
more, in tho&s;e &s;cenes, be remembered.
Yet in a moment the cruel truth occurred to
him, that whether this place belonged to
him or to another, Cele&s;tina would never
again vi&s;it it; that he &s;hould never again
hear her voice calling him among the beech
woods, or trace her foot&s;teps on the turf;
never li&s;ten to her as &s;he read in his mo|ther's
dre&s;&s;ing room, or hold her hand
within his as they &s;at together on the woody
banks of the water-fall, and marked it's
&s;parkling current leap from rock to rock.
And without her, what would Alve&s;tone be
but a place where every &s;pot would be
haunted by melancholy images of departed
happine&s;s. How little the indulgence of
the&s;e painful contemplations would be in|terrupted,
or put an end to, by any &s;atisfac|tion
he could derive from the conver&s;ation
<PB N="47" REF="49">
of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, his &s;ick and reluc|tant
heart too plainly told him: and then he
again believed him&s;elf determined to &s;ell all
his e&s;tatesand quit England; if not for ever,
at lea&s;t till time, ab&s;ence, and the impo&s;&s;i|bility
of his changing it, had better recon|ciled
him to that de&s;tiny which condemned
him to give up Cele&s;tina, and to &s;ee her in
the arms of another.</P>
<P>A de&s;ultory and un&s;ettled life, had within
the la&s;t year become habitual to him; and
while he was actually moving from one
place to another, his &s;pirits preyed le&s;s
corro&s;ively on them&s;elves. Since to live as
he wi&s;hed to have lived in his own country
was impo&s;&s;ible, he thought he &s;hould re|gret
it le&s;s while he was wandering over
others: and &s;ince he could not now con|template
the face and character he &s;o fondly
loved, he hoped that variety of characters
and variety of faces would divert his regret
if they could not cure his attachment.
There was too an idea of freedom and in|dependence,
which accompanied his thus
<PB N="48" REF="50">
&s;haking off at once every incumbrance,
that was not without it's charms; and in
this di&s;po&s;ition he thought contemptuou&s;ly
of mere local preference as unworthy a
&s;trong mind, and determined to become a
citizen of the world; and when in his ima|gination
he had &s;ettled his rout, through
Holland and France to Sicily, which he
had long wi&s;hed to &s;ee, and from thence
to the Archipelago, he breathed freer, and
felt him&s;elf more reconciled to exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>He journeyed, however, &s;lowly towards
London while the&s;e debates were carrying
on: and at York, whither he had ordered
his letters to be directed, he found one
from Cathcart which related &s;ome circum|&s;tances
in regard to his affairs that con|vinced
him he could not, unle&s;s to the
material injury of &s;ome per&s;ons who were
connected with him, quit England without
&s;ome regulation of tho&s;e pecuniary con|cerns
which he had &s;o long neglected and
would now willingly have e&s;caped from.
This letter determined him to return to
<PB N="49" REF="51">
London; though another letter from his
&s;i&s;ter, in which &s;he mentioned, as an article
of news, that Cele&s;tina was either actually
married to Montague Thorold or on the
point of being &s;o, threw him into a &s;tate
of mind bordering on di&s;traction: rea&s;on,
which had long fruitle&s;sly contended
again&s;t this fatal, and perhaps guilty attach|ment,
now &s;eemed tired of a contention &s;o
hopele&s;s, and his mind became a chaos of
conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, all equally de&s;tructive
to his mental and bodily health.</P>
<P>To return to London, however, was be|come
nece&s;&s;ary; and Farnham, his old
faithful &s;ervant, per&s;uaded him to take
po&s;t chai&s;es for the re&s;t of his journey. He
arrived, after an ab&s;ence of above three
weeks, at the hou&s;e of Lady Molyneux;
and there heard, that a few days before,
Lady Horatia Howard had publicly &s;poken
of Cele&s;tina's marriage with the young di|vine
as a &s;ettled thing; that his father had
bought for him a con&s;iderable living in
Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, where they were to re&s;ide,
<PB N="50" REF="52">
and where a curate was &s;ettled till he was
him&s;elf qualified to take it; and thither,
as there was a very good hou&s;e upon it,
they were going immediately after their
marriage. Willoughby heard all this with|out
being able to make any reply, and then
ha&s;tened to his own lodgings, from whence
he di&s;patched Farnham for intelligence
from the &s;ervants of Lady Horatia. The
coachman, with whom he had &s;ome time
before made an acquaintance and who was
a very talkative fellow, immediately in|formed
him of all he knew, and much that
he imagined. He &s;aid it was very true,
that Mr. Thorold lived almo&s;t always at
their hou&s;e, "and my Lady," &s;aid the
man&mdash;"my Lady loves him for all the
world as if he was her own &s;on. There they
are all morning reading play books and,
&s;uch together, as my fellow &s;ervants tell
me, that is, my Lady and Mi&s;s and this
here young divine as is to be; and then
they goes out in my coach, all's one as if
they belonged to the &s;ame family; and I
<PB N="51" REF="53">
do under&s;tand as how my Lady is to give
her a portion and they be to be married
out of hand, that is in a little time, and I
believe that's the very truth of the thing,
for my Lady have bought another coach
hor&s;e within the&s;e ten days, and told me&mdash;"Abraham,"
&s;ays &s;he, "I &s;hall go early next
month into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, in&s;tead of go|ing
to Matlock as I talked of, and I &s;hall
go in the coach in&s;tead of the po&s;t chai&s;e,
becau&s;e I have &s;ome friends with me."</P>
<P>This account, which Farnham faithfully
repeated to Willoughby, confirmed almo&s;t
beyond a doubt all Lady Molyneux had
related to him. Some more recent intelli|gence
that he had received from Cathcart as
to the embroiled &s;tate of his affairs in the
country, combined to render him de&s;pe|rate:
and he had been &s;o long harra&s;&s;ed be|tween
his love and his intere&s;t, his honour
and his reluctance, that he &s;uddenly took
the re&s;olution of putting it out of his own
power to undergo again &s;uch variety of
torments: like a wretch who leaps from a
<PB N="52" REF="54">
&s;hip on fire into the &s;ea, though certain of
meeting death in another &s;hape, he formed
the determination of making him&s;elf, &s;ince
he mu&s;t be wretched, as completely
wretched as po&s;&s;ible. He thought of Cele&s;|tina
as his relation in vain; it abated no|thing
of that angui&s;h with which he con&s;i|dered
her as the wife of Montague Thorold;
and &s;o hideous were the images that forced
them&s;elves upon him, that he found his rea|&s;on
had no power to &s;ubdue them, and
thought that nothing could &s;o decidedly
oblige him to check them as his marriage;
and without giving him&s;elf time to con&s;ider
how de&s;perate was the remedy, he went
immediately to the hou&s;e of Lord Ca&s;tle|north,
declared to him that he was &s;atisfied
as to the object of his journey, and took
the mo&s;t immediate opportunity after his
return of expre&s;&s;ing his &s;olicitude to avail
him&s;elf of his cou&s;in's generous predilection
in his favour, and to fulfil the wi&s;hes of his
decea&s;ed mother and his &s;urviving family.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">
The eager and tremulous manner in which
lie uttered all this, and which was in reality
the effect of de&s;pair and angui&s;h, Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth mi&s;took for the anxiety and im|patience
of love. His nephew had never
&s;poke thus deci&s;ively before; and &s;eeing
thus what he had &s;o long fondly wi&s;hed for
out of doubt, his fir&s;t idea was, to proceed
in&s;tantly in &s;ecuring to Willoughby the
rever&s;ion of tho&s;e titles on which he &s;et &s;o
high a value him&s;elf. While, therefore, he
&s;at out in his chariot, &s;upported by Mrs.
Calder, who always attended him, to &s;olicit
the completion of a bu&s;ine&s;s which had hi|ther
proceeded but &s;lowly, and fancied the
happine&s;s of all parties would be wonder|fully
advanced by his &s;ucce&s;s, Willoughby,
with &s;uch &s;en&s;ations as a determined &s;uicide
alone could envy, was making to Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth the &s;ame declaration; and was
immediately afterwards allowed, or rather
de&s;ired, to pre&s;ent him&s;elf at the feet of her
fair daughter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>TO play the lover is not difficult to mo&s;t
men, even where their hearts are not really
intere&s;ted. A few fine &s;peeches, a little
common place declamation, are ea&s;ily pro|duced
and generally accepted: but Wil|loughby,
always a very poor di&s;&s;embler,
and who felt, in de&s;pite of every effort to
repre&s;s them, &s;entiments towards Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
bordering on antipathy, was very
con&s;cious that he &s;hould ill an&s;wer her ideas
of a pa&s;&s;ionate lover, and this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
deprived him of the little power he might
otherwi&s;e have had to di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>He now, with encrea&s;ed confu&s;ion of
thought, repented that he had gone &s;o far;
but to recede was impo&s;&s;ible; and with a
countenance expre&s;&s;ive rather of perturba|tion
<PB N="55" REF="57">
and wretchedne&s;s than of the plea&s;ura|ble
&s;en&s;ations in&s;pired by &s;ucce&s;sful love,
he entered the apartment where Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
had been prepared by Lady Ca&s;tle|north
to receive his tender profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>He approached her, and took her hand;
muttered &s;omething about the final ecclair|ci&s;&s;ement
of his doubts as to another per|&s;on,
(for he dared not tru&s;t his voice with
the name of Cele&s;tina), and &s;omething
about being, in con&s;equence of that ecclair|ci&s;&s;ement,
relea&s;ed from his former engage|ments:
then in a &s;till more tremulous and
uncertain tone, he &s;olicited her permi&s;&s;ion
to dedicate his life to her &s;ervice, and to
ha&s;ten tho&s;e preparations for his happine&s;s,
which his former uncertainties and embar|ra&s;&s;ments
had put it out of his power to &s;o|licit
with that ardour which he &s;hould un|der
other circum&s;tances have evinced.</P>
<P>The fal&s;ehood he was uttering died away
almo&s;t inarticulately on his lips, and his re|volting
heart reproached him for it, faint and
reluctantas it was. As he fini&s;hed his &s;peech,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman turned her large black
eyes, which had till then been mode&s;tly
ca&s;t down, full upon him. She &s;eemed to
have been trying to make them &s;peak ten|derne&s;s;
but to him they expre&s;&s;ed nothing
but an imperious enquiry into the truth of
his profe&s;&s;ions, from which he &s;hrunk. In
a moment, however, tho&s;e eyes, &s;o little
calculated for the &s;oft parley of affection,
contrived to overflow with tears. She gave
him the hand he had ju&s;t before let go, and
inclining her head tenderly towards him,
&s;aid, in terms as gentle as &s;he could com|mand&mdash;"Oh!
Willoughby! you know
too well, you have long known my unfor|tunate
partiality towards you&mdash;a partiality,
which, with reluctance and with regret I
own, not all your too evident coldne&s;s has
conquered. Alas! could I now believe
you &s;incere!&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Believe it I conjure you," cried he in
a hurried voice, and ha&s;tening to put an
end to a dialogue which he found he could
&s;o ill &s;upport&mdash;"Believe it, dear Madam!
<PB N="57" REF="59">
and believe, (what is true al&s;o)&mdash;that I
have now no other engagement&mdash;no other
attachment&mdash;and cannot but be&mdash;be truly
&s;en&s;ible of your extraordinary merit."</P>
<P>"I will believe it," an&s;wered &s;he: "I
will endeavour to believe it, for I find, that
even if I am deceived, the deceit is dear to
me."</P>
<P>Willoughby then ki&s;&s;ed her hand with
as much warmth as he could affect; and
running over, in the breathle&s;s tremor which
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his di&s;ingenuous conduct
occa&s;ioned, a few common place &s;entences
about eternal gratitude and unalterable
love; &s;peeches which have probably been
repeated ten million of times with as little
&s;incerity but &s;eldom with &s;o much &s;elf re|proof,
he led her to talk of preparations,
and equipages, and jewels; &s;ubjects on which
&s;he entered with &s;uch ea&s;e as &s;hewed that
her mind had been familiarized to con&s;ider
them, and that they were not without im|portance
in her opinion. Poor Willough|by,
who now felt his fate irretrievable, had
<PB N="58" REF="60">
very different &s;en&s;ations. Oppre&s;&s;ed and
bewildered by a variety of &s;ufferings, yet
compelled, by the part he had thus ra&s;hly
determined to act, to &s;tifle them all, his
prevailing idea was, that &s;ince the Rubicon
was now pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;ooner this dreaded
marriage was over the better for him; &s;ince
his mind mu&s;t then combat, with more force
than it could now do, tho&s;e wild eccentri|cities,
the offspring of de&s;pair, which were
crouding fa&s;t upon him. He therefore
pre&s;&s;ed for an early day; not with the vehe|mence
of love, but with that of a wretch
who knowing he mu&s;t die, wi&s;hes to hear
his phy&s;ician fix the period when his tor|ments
are likely to end. Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
however, either could not or would
not di&s;cover this; and though his inflamed
eyes, his &s;hort &s;ighs, un&s;ettled manner, and
broken &s;entences, gave him altogether the
appearance rather of a man &s;uffering under
&s;ome recent calamity than of a favoured and
fortunate lover on the point of obtaining his
happine&s;s, the lady, either from her confi|dence
<PB N="59" REF="61">
in her own charms, or from &s;ome
other cau&s;e, was perfectly &s;atisfied with his
behaviour; and before he left her, pro|mi&s;ed
that &s;he would not oppo&s;e the ar|rangement
which &s;he under&s;tood to have
been made by her father&mdash;that in three
weeks he &s;hould receive her hand.</P>
<P>This then was determined without po&s;&s;i|bility
of recall; and Willoughby, too &s;en&s;i|ble
already of the weight of tho&s;e chains
which he had thus ha&s;tily forged for him|&s;elf,
now di&s;engaged him&s;elf as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible, and ran out of the hou&s;e, impa|tient
to be alone, and to contemplate in
the &s;tillne&s;s of his own room the pro&s;pect of
mi&s;ery into which he had thus ra&s;hly bound
him&s;elf to ru&s;h. He walked very fa&s;t, and
as if he was flying from him&s;elf, towards
his lodgings in Bond-&s;treet, where, as he
pa&s;&s;ed along it, a croud of pa&s;&s;engers near
one of the cro&s;&s;ings impeded his pa&s;&s;age.
He regarded them not; but made his way
eagerly among them, till he was imme|diately
between a footman who waited at
<PB N="60" REF="62">
the door of a coach, and a young lady who
was coming out of a &s;hop to &s;tep into it.
On his pre&s;&s;ing rather ha&s;tily before her,
the &s;ervant put him back with his hand.
Willoughby, out of humour at that mo|ment
with him&s;elf and with all the world,
and fancying the action of the footman
impertinent, &s;poke to him very har&s;hly and
was almo&s;t provoked to &s;trike him, when
the lady, who had her foot on the &s;tep, ap|peared
a good deal alarmed, and no &s;ooner
heard the &s;ound of his voice thus menacing,
than &s;he caught the &s;ervant's arm for &s;up|port;
and at the &s;ame moment Willough|by,
who had not till then &s;een her face, be|held
the lovely but pale and terrified coun|tenance
of Cele&s;tina!</P>
<P>Thrown entirely off his guard, and not
knowing what he did, he took the hand
with which &s;he had &s;upported her&s;elf again&s;t
the &s;ervant. "Cele&s;tina!" cried he&mdash;"Oh
God! is it you, Cele&s;tina?"</P>
<P>She looked at him with eyes where &s;ur|pri&s;e
was &s;oftened by tenderne&s;s, and tried
<PB N="61" REF="63">
to recover voice enough to utter more
than&mdash;"Willoughby!" which the imme|diate
emotion drew from her: but he gave
her not time; for fixing his eyes on her's,
all that &s;he had been to him, all that he be|lieved
&s;he was now to another, and all
that he had ju&s;t agreed to be him&s;elf,
ru&s;hed upon his recollection at once,
and in an agony of grief, remor&s;e, and de|&s;pair,
he threw her hand from him, and
turning away, he walked, or rather ran
towards his lodgings as if he had been pur|&s;ued
by the furies, where, without giving
his &s;ervant time to open it, he rapped at
the door with violence enough to break it
down; &s;o fearful he &s;eemed of again &s;eeing
Cele&s;tina as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in the coach, which,
by the hor&s;es being in that direction, would,
he thought, come that way.</P>
<P>Farnham, his &s;ervant, who opened the
door, was amazed at his impatience &s;o un|like
his u&s;ual manner, and with &s;till more
&s;urpri&s;e &s;aw him, in&s;tead of &s;peaking and
enquiring for letters, as he always did when
<PB N="62" REF="64">
he came in, and was particularly likely now
to do after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, ru&s;h by him
as if he had not &s;een him; and hurrying up
&s;tairs by two &s;teps at a time, &s;hut the door
of the dining room with a violence that
&s;hook the whole hou&s;e, and turn the key.</P>
<P>This faithful &s;ervant had lived with him
from the time of his leaving &s;chool, and
was more attached to his ma&s;ter than to any
other per&s;on on earth. He had &s;een with
deep concern the &s;ad change that had hap|pened
in his health and in his temper, &s;ince
that unfortunate night when he &s;o &s;uddenly
left Alve&s;tone the year before, and had, in
all his journies and all his illne&s;s, watched
over him with a&s;&s;iduous and attentive care.
He had often known him dejected, and al|mo&s;t
&s;inking under his uncertainties and his
di&s;appointments, but had never till now ob|&s;erved
&s;uch fury in his eyes and marks of
de&s;peration in his manner; and alarmed at
the circum&s;tance of his having locked the
door of his room, Farnham was immediately
be&s;et with numberle&s;s fearful conjectures.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">
He was aware that his ma&s;ter's affairs were
far from being pro&s;perous, and imagined it
po&s;&s;ible that he might be pur&s;ued for debt:
and as he knew his pride would render &s;uch
a thing almo&s;t in&s;upportable, he feared lea&s;t
in the &s;udden agony to which it might &s;ub|ject
him, he might commit &s;ome violence
on him&s;elf. Willoughby's temper was na|turally
very mild, and not ea&s;ily inflamed
to anger; but when that did happen, his
anger was dreadful; and though Farnham
had only once or twice &s;een it excited dur|ing
his long &s;ervice, he knew how terrible
it was when thoroughly rou&s;ed.</P>
<P>The conjectures that Farnham enter|tained
were not to be &s;upported calmly;
and though he had always received &s;trict
orders never to enter the room where his
ma&s;ter was bu&s;y, till he rang or called for
him, he was now &s;trongly tempted, yet
dared not determine to di&s;obey his com|mands.
He could not, however, forbear
going to the door and li&s;tening. He heard
his ma&s;ter utter deep and convul&s;ive &s;ighs:
<PB N="64" REF="66">
he heard him walking by &s;tarts in the room;
but, by the key's being left in the lock, he
could &s;ee nothing. He then went &s;oftly
into the bed chamber; and from thence a
defect in the door, which opened from it
into the dining room, enabled him to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
that Willoughby now &s;at by a table
on which his arms were thrown, and on
them he re&s;ted his head; while his hair, all
in di&s;order, concealed every part of his
face: then in a moment &s;tarting up, he
traver&s;ed the room with quick and uncer|tain
&s;teps, now cla&s;ping his hands together,
now throwing them wildly abroad. At
length he &s;topped, and &s;triking his fore|head,
&s;aid, in a voice rather re&s;embling
groaning than &s;peaking&mdash;"Oh accur&s;ed,
accur&s;ed wretch!&mdash;what ha&s;t thou done!"</P>
<P>Still more alarmed by the&s;e words, and
by beholding the frantic ge&s;tures with which
his ma&s;ter now leaned again&s;t the &s;ide of
the chimney, now flew to the other &s;ide of
the room, and now threw him&s;elf on a &s;o|pha,
Farnham again debated with him&s;elf
<PB N="65" REF="67">
whether he &s;hould not go in at any event.
There was a <HI>couteau de cha&s;&s;e</HI> and a &s;word
hung up in the room, and two brace of
pi&s;tols in their ca&s;es, which Farnham had
ju&s;t put there, loaded as they were when his
ma&s;ter travelled; and the poor fellow fan|cied
that on the&s;e, whenever he pa&s;&s;ed
them, his ma&s;ter looked wildly eager.
This might be &s;ome time fancy: but at
length, either from accident or from his
feeling at that in&s;tant &s;ome horrible tempta|tion
to e&s;cape from the evils that ju&s;t then
appeared quite intolerable, Willoughby
&s;topped with folded arms oppo&s;ite to the&s;e
in&s;truments of de&s;truction, and while his
expre&s;&s;ive countenance was marked with
the &s;evere&s;t angui&s;h, he murmured inarti|culately
&s;ome words which Farnham inter|preted
as a determination to put an end to
his &s;ufferings. Bent at any hazard to pre|vent
his executing this fearful threat, the
affrighted &s;ervant now &s;earched with trem|bling
hands for the lock, which he forgot
he could not open. His ma&s;ter demanded,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
in a voice which &s;truck him with terror,
who was there? when luckily for him a
thundering rap at the &s;treet door gave him
hopes that &s;ome vi&s;itors might be coming
who might more properly and effectually
interfere, and he flew down to let them in,
regardle&s;s of Willoughby, who, coming
out to the top of the &s;tairs, called to him,
and peremptorily ordered him to admit no|body.</P>
<P>It was Sir Philip Molyneux; who hav|ing
ju&s;t met Lord Ca&s;tlenorth at the Mini&s;|ter's
levee, had heard from him that Wil|loughby,
immediately on his arrival in
town, had agreed to the conclu&s;ion of his
marriage; and that in con&s;equence of it he
had him&s;elf been attending the levee to ha&s;|ten
the affair of the rever&s;ionary titles, which,
affair was likely to be &s;peedily concluded.
Sir Philip, therefore, having received this
intelligence, called as he went home to
congratulate his brother in law, and to take
him to dinner in Portman-&s;quare.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">
Little accu&s;tomed as Sir Philip was to
make remarks on any body's appearance,
and particularly on that of his inferiors, he
was not with&s;tanding &s;truck with the coun|tenance
of Farnham, as, pale and agha&s;t,
he opened the door to him; and as he went
before him up &s;tairs, he enquired what ailed
him. "I hardly know indeed Sir," replied
Farnham: "but my ma&s;ter, who came
from Barnet only early this morning as you
know I &s;uppo&s;e Sir, off his York&s;hire jour|ney,
has been out &s;omewhere &s;ince, and is
come home in &s;uch a humour as I am &s;ure
I have never &s;een him in in all the years I
have lived with him: be &s;o good, Sir,
however, as not to take notice that I &s;poke
about it."</P>
<P>Sir Philip had no time to promi&s;e he
would not, before they were at the door of
the dining room, where Willoughby &s;tood
and &s;ternly &s;aid to his &s;ervant&mdash;"How dare
you, Sir, di&s;obey me in this manner? did
I not tell you, &s;tupid hound, that I would
not be at home?"</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">
"Lord, Sir," cried Farmham in great
di&s;tre&s;s, for he was little accu&s;tomed and
could hardly bear to be thus har&s;hly re|proved&mdash;"Lord,
Sir&mdash;it is only Sir Phi|lip&mdash;and
I am &s;ure I thought&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Cur&s;e on your thoughts!" cried Wil|loughby.
"Blockhead&mdash;are you to think
for me?"</P>
<P>"Hey day!" &s;aid Sir Philip, "what's
all this? Don't be angry with poor Farn|ham.
I would come in, for I was impatient
to wi&s;h you joy."</P>
<P>"Joy, Sir?&mdash;of what?"</P>
<P>"Why I have this moment &s;een Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth, who has told me that every thing
is &s;ettled at la&s;t. Come, I'm very glad to
hear it, for it mu&s;t be owned that this bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
George, has advanced but &s;lowly.
Well! &s;o now 'tis to be done directly?
The old peer was quite fri&s;ky upon it, and
forgot his a&s;thma and his gout to &s;tand till
I was tired of hearing him, telling me of
the regulation he had made as to your
name: he becomes Earl and Vi&s;count Ca&s;|tlenorth;
<PB N="69" REF="71">
and you take, as your title, that
of Baron Raven&s;burgh. I heard the hi&s;tory
too of how that came into the family.
Well, but George, you'll go dine with us.
Lady Molyneux will be glad, perhaps, to
hear about it, and to wi&s;h you joy."</P>
<P>"Joy&mdash;damnation rather!" muttered
Willoughby, as, &s;natching away his hand,
he fled to the other end of the room: then
by an effort recovering him&s;elf a little, he
returned towards Sir Philip, and &s;aid, with
forced calmne&s;s&mdash;"Prythee don't teize me
with the&s;e hateful common place congratu|lations.
Surely it is bad enough for a fellow
to be forced to hear them afterwards, and
indeed bad enough to be married, without
having them rung in his ears for a month
before hand."</P>
<P>Sir Philip, who now &s;aw very plainly that
his reluctance was by no means &s;ubdued,
had no inclination to argue the matter with
him. He had no idea why he might not be
happy with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman or any other
woman of equal fortune: but whether he
<PB N="70" REF="72">
was &s;o or no, his own &s;olicitude went no
further than that his brother in law might
not be reduced either to a &s;tate of indigence
&s;uch as might di&s;grace his alliance or com|pel
him to borrow money of his relations;
and as Willoughby's marriage with Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman would preclude the po&s;&s;ibility
of any &s;uch awkward circum&s;tances, he
heartily wi&s;hed it, and had of late forgot
his u&s;ual apathy to join with his wife in pro|moting
it.</P>
<P>There was, he thought, no occa&s;ion for
argument in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;ince the af|fair
was now, whether Willoughby liked it
or no, irrevocably fixed upon. He there|fore
&s;pared him&s;elf the fatigue of remarks or
remon&s;trance on Willoughby's behaviour,
and only &s;aid&mdash;"But you'll dine with us,
George, to-day&mdash;will you not?"</P>
<P>"No, I cannot," replied Willoughby.</P>
<P>"To-morrow then. We &s;hall have a
large party, and dine exactly at &s;even o'clock.</P>
<P>"I will if I can. But I can engage for
nothing. I hate to be fettered by engage|ments:
<PB N="71" REF="73">
but if I can come I will. Shall I
ring for your &s;ervants?"</P>
<P>"They are at the door," &s;aid Sir Philip,
who immediately went away, without hav|ing
any great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the
politene&s;s of his brother in law. Of that,
however, he thought not; and if the beha|viour
of Willoughby afterwards occurred to
him at all, it only created a momentary
&s;urpri&s;e, mingled with &s;ome degree of pity,
which his ab&s;urdity, and not his evident
unhappine&s;s, excited.</P>
<P>His vi&s;it, however, had the effect of
rou&s;ing Willoughby from that dreadful con|dition
of mind into which the &s;tep he had
taken that morning in regard to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
and the &s;udden &s;ight of Cele&s;tina,
had thrown him. He now became able to
collect his thoughts; and was at once con|&s;cious
of the general folly of his conduct,
and of his cruel behaviour to Farnham,
who was &s;o hurt by having &s;een his ma&s;ter
in &s;uch a &s;tate, and by the unkind and un|u&s;ual
way in which he had &s;poke to him,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
that when the poor fellow came up to en|quire
if he would plea&s;e to dre&s;s, the tears
were in his eyes, and he was hardly able to
&s;peak.</P>
<P>Willoughby was of too noble a nature
not to apologi&s;e for his fault the moment
he felt it. He an&s;wered mildly that he
&s;hould dre&s;s directly, and then &s;aid&mdash;"Farnham,
I &s;poke angrily to you ju&s;t
now, and I am &s;orry for it. I was vexed,
and could not command my temper. You
were wrong too in letting in Sir Philip
Molyneux. Another time remember, that
when I give orders to be denied I except
nobody unle&s;s I particularly name them."</P>
<P>Poor Farnham dared not &s;ay why he
then ventured to di&s;obey him; but in the
mo&s;t humble terms begged his pardon and
&s;aid he was very &s;orry. "Well, well," cried
Willoughby, with a deep &s;igh, "and I
am very &s;orry, Farnham, that I was &s;o
fooli&s;hly pa&s;&s;ionate. Let us think no more
of it." He then bade him get his things to
dre&s;s, and tried, by taking up a book, to
<PB N="73" REF="75">
divert his thoughts from him&s;elf, and ob|tain
at lea&s;t a re&s;pite from the corro&s;ive re|flections
that pur&s;ued him; but it would not
do: he threw the book away, and felt, not|with&s;tanding
all his efforts, his wretched|ne&s;s
and impatience returning: while Farn|ham,
who as he dre&s;&s;ed his hair watched
every turn of his countenance, &s;aw but too
plainly that his ma&s;ter was half di&s;tracted
by &s;omething into which he dared not en|quire.
This gave a &s;ort of unquiet flow|ne&s;s
to his manner, which Willoughby ob|&s;erving,
was on the point of relap&s;ing into
that &s;ort of behaviour for which he had but
the moment before expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow,
and impetuou&s;ly bade him mind what he
was about and make ha&s;te: then hardly
&s;uffering him to fini&s;h his hair, he &s;tarted
up, and putting on his cloaths in the ha&s;te
that denoted the unquietne&s;s of his mind,
he &s;ent for a hackney coach, and ordered it
to &s;et him down at the hotel in Soho-&s;quare.
Farnham &s;till apprehending that &s;ome fatal
event might follow all the agitation of
<PB N="74" REF="76">
mind which he had witne&s;&s;ed, now ap|proached
again, and a&s;ked if he &s;hould be
at home in the evening, or &s;up at home?
To which Willoughby, no longer able to
check him&s;elf, an&s;wered&mdash;"no!" as he
drew up the gla&s;s, in an accent that terrified
poor Farnham; who, more and more con|firmed
in his notion that &s;omething was
about to befall his ma&s;ter, now concluded
that &s;omething was a duel. The pi&s;tols
and the &s;word indeed were &s;till hanging up
in the dining room: but yet he could not
be ea&s;y; and, after &s;ome con&s;ideration, he
determined to go and enquire among the
&s;ervants at Sir Philip Molyneux's and at
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth's if they could at all
gue&s;s what was the matter; and with mo&s;t
of the latter he was particularly acquainted,
by having been much with them at Flo|rence
and Naples when his ma&s;ter was la&s;t
abroad.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IF Willoughby was &s;o deeply affected
by the &s;ight of Cele&s;tina, the &s;udden &s;hock
&s;he had received from their abrupt meeting,
and from his &s;trange behaviour, had on her
an equally painful though a different ef|fect.
That the impul&s;e of the moment had
urged him to take her hand, made her hope
that &s;ome remains of affection for her yet
lingered in his bo&s;om, and that his former
regard was rather &s;tifled by anger than an|nihilated
by indifference. She knew that
the fir&s;t might be removed, and that &s;he
might be re&s;tored to his friend&s;hip; but
that if his heart had once become quite cold
towards her, nothing could ever renew even
that &s;hare of tenderne&s;s with which &s;he could
<PB N="76" REF="78">
learn, if not to be happy, at lea&s;t to be con|tent.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before &s;he could reco|ver
from the agitation of &s;pirits into which
this unexpected interview had thrown her:
but when &s;he at length became calm
enough to reflect on it, &s;he determined to
&s;ay nothing of having &s;een Willoughby to
Lady Horatia, as &s;he knew it would ap|pear
to her only a fre&s;h in&s;tance of his un|worthy
treatment of her; on which, how
&s;everely &s;oever &s;he felt it, &s;he did not love
to hear any comments even from her be&s;t
friends. With all the re&s;olution &s;he could
collect, therefore, &s;tifling her internal an|gui&s;h,
&s;he prepared to go with a large
party in the evening to Ranelagh.</P>
<P>While &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing for this purpo&s;e,
a &s;ervant brought up to her the following
letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>That a &s;tranger, and a &s;tranger in my
&s;ituation of life, &s;hould addre&s;s you,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
would po&s;&s;ibly appear, to any le&s;s gene|rous
mind than your's, a liberty that
&s;hould be repul&s;ed with di&s;dain and re|&s;ented
by contempt: but I am per&s;uaded
that from you <HI>I</HI> may expect that liberal
candour with which true virtue and un|affected
goodne&s;s con&s;iders even tho&s;e
whom the generality of the world agree
to condemn and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>You know, Madam, what I have
been and what I am. From Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
you have probably learned
what were the circum&s;tances of my
early life; and Mr. Vava&s;our, with that
&s;incerity which de&s;erves to be &s;o highly
valued, has told you how long I have
been under his protection.</P>
<P>He has &s;ince, Madam, expre&s;&s;ed
&s;omefears that this information may have
been prejudicial to his intere&s;t with you,
and lea&s;t it &s;hould be &s;o, allow me to
declare to you, that I know my&s;elf too
well to believe for a moment that I ought
to be in que&s;tion where you are beloved
<PB N="78" REF="80">
&mdash;too well to he&s;itate in declaring, that
attached as I am to Mr. Vava&s;our, <HI>I</HI> can
never make him as happy as he de&s;erves
to be.</P>
<P>No, Madam; that happine&s;s depends
entirely on you. Such a pa&s;&s;ion as he
feels for you, I believe no other per&s;on
can de&s;erve; and I know him to have
&s;o good a heart, I de&s;ire his felicity &s;o
&s;incerely, that I hazard this &s;tep in the
hope of promoting it.</P>
<P>Mr. Vava&s;our's genero&s;ity has left me
nothing to fear for the re&s;t of my life,
were it even to be a long one: but I feel
that a very few months will bring it to
an end; and I feel it without concern;
for, thoughtle&s;s and unworthy as my con|duct
has been, I have never found in
its mo&s;t brilliant periods, that the glitter|ing
trappings be&s;towed by mercenary
love, could quiet the throbbing heart
that beat beneath them: and now my
only wi&s;h is, to be forgiven and re|ceived
by my family, and to pa&s;s the
<PB N="79" REF="81">
&s;hort remainder of my days with them.
You can intercede with them &s;ucce&s;s|fully,
for they can refu&s;e you nothing.
Deign then, Madam, to intere&s;t your|&s;elf
for me, and at the &s;ame time be a&s;|&s;ured
that it is my purpo&s;e to withdraw
my&s;elf for ever from Mr. Vava&s;our,
whenever he will &s;uffer me to go, which
&s;hall, he &s;ays, be whenever you will give
him hopes of li&s;tening to him.</P>
<P>If genero&s;ity, &s;incerity, good nature,
and under&s;tanding, may be &s;ufficient re|commendations
to your good opinion,
Mr. Vava&s;our eminently de&s;erves it;
and whatever faults he may have, your
virtues will correct. He knows no|thing
of my writing to you; but I am
con&s;cious that I owe <HI>him</HI> &s;uch an effort
where the felicity of his future days is
concerned, and I feel that in addre&s;&s;ing
<HI>you,</HI> my pre&s;umption if not &s;ucce&s;sful
will be forgiven.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">
Cele&s;tina could not peru&s;e &s;uch a letter
without a mixture of admiration and pity
for the amiable unhappy writer. Though
her re&s;olution in regard to Vava&s;our could
not be changed, &s;he thought that &s;he &s;hould
no longer delay acquainting Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone
and Cathcart with the information &s;he
had obtained relative to their &s;i&s;ter; but it
required &s;ome con&s;ideration, at lea&s;t in re|gard
to Cathcart. The circum&s;tance of
Emily's letter added to the flutter of &s;pirits
which the meeting in the morning had
given her. Montague Thorold, who dined
with Lady Horatia, and was to be one of
their party at Ranelagh, contrived to be
more than u&s;ually importunate with her
for more pity and favour than &s;he had lately
&s;hewn him: while the ladies, and Mr.How|ard,
who joined them in the evening, com|pleted
her angui&s;h and confu&s;ion, by talk|ing.
of the marriage which was in a few days
to take place between Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
and Mr. Willoughby. One of the&s;e was
<PB N="81" REF="83">
acquainted with Mrs. Calder, and had
heard from her that morning that every
thing was &s;ettled, the title arranged, the
equipages and liveries be&s;poke, and the
jewels and cloaths concluded upon, all of
which &s;he detailed at great length; while
another &s;aid, that <HI>&s;he</HI> under&s;tood that the
marriage was to take place at Ca&s;tlenorth,
and that from thence all the family were to
proceed together to Italy, where they were
to pa&s;s a twelvemonth. All, however,
agreed that it was certainly to be concluded
immediately, and Cele&s;tina could not any
longer entertain a doubt of it.</P>
<P>Though her heart had always revolted
from the idea of Willoughby's union with
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, &s;he had been now &s;o
long accu&s;tomed to think of it, that &s;he
felt le&s;s poignant concern on that account,
but if po&s;&s;ible more than ever from his
continued coldne&s;s, and the cruel neg|lect
he had been guilty of in not an&s;wer|ing
her letter. "That he marries ano|ther,"
cried &s;he, as &s;he reflected on it, "I
<PB N="82" REF="84">
might learn to &s;ubmit to without murmur|ing,
if it can contribute to his ea&s;e or hap|pine&s;s
in any way; but that he &s;hould quite
de&s;ert and for&s;ake me after &s;o many a&s;&s;ur|ances
of e&s;teem and regard, even when
love was no longer in que&s;tion; that he
&s;hould di&s;dain to own that connection by
blood, if he is &s;ure that it is &s;o, which made
him, with &s;o much apparent reluctance,
relinqui&s;h every other, that he &s;hould with|out
pity leave me to a de&s;tiny which owes
its unhappine&s;s to him, &s;eems &s;o &s;trange,
&s;o unnatural, &s;o unlike him!&mdash;If I could
once &s;ee him, hear him talk to me with
friendly calmne&s;s, and tell me that he felt
for me fraternal affection, or even the re|gard
of long acquaintance, even what his
mother's ward might claim from him, I
think I &s;hould be comparatively happy, and
&s;hould have no farther wi&s;h than to hear
&s;ometimes from him&s;elf that he was happy
too. But to be thrown from him in this
unfeeling and unfriendly way, to be for|gotten
and abandoned as if I had been
<PB N="83" REF="85">
found unworthy not only of his affection
but of his remembrance&mdash;oh! it is too
much."</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections, and the unintere&s;ting
conver&s;ation of the company &s;he was with,
to which &s;he was compelled to attend in
order to e&s;cape the more irk&s;ome importu|nity
of Montague Thorold, &s;erved but lit|tle
to rai&s;e her &s;pirits. They did not reach
Ranelagh till a late hour: but on their en|trance,
the fir&s;t party they met was Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth, her daughter, and Lady Mo|lyneux.
Captain Cavanaugh was on one
&s;ide between the two former; and in deep
conference with the latter was Captain Tho|rold.</P>
<P>The ladies, who could not avoid &s;eeing
Cele&s;tina, pa&s;&s;ed her with averted and
haughty looks. Cavanaugh fixed his eyes
on her with a look of bold enquiry, and
Captain Thorold, as he pa&s;&s;ed his brother,
&s;aid&mdash;"Ho! Montague, are you there? I
did not know you were in town my boy!"
He then gave a &s;ignificant nod, as much
<PB N="84" REF="86">
as to &s;ay&mdash;"Aye, aye, I &s;ee how you are
engaged," and pa&s;&s;ed on, renewing with
great &s;eeming earne&s;tne&s;s his conver&s;ation
with Lady Molyneux.</P>
<P>Though there was not in the world ano|ther
&s;et of people whom Cele&s;tina could be
&s;o little plea&s;ed to meet, and though &s;he
heard throughout the room, and from every
group that pa&s;&s;ed them, the report of Wil|loughby's
marriage, with various comments
and circum&s;tances, &s;uch as every body
thought them&s;elves at liberty to adorn it
with, &s;he felt a &s;ort of &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing
that he was not with them; and while there
was not any thing &s;he really &s;o ardently de|&s;ired
as his happine&s;s, yet &s;o contradictory
is the human heart, that &s;he wi&s;hed to be|lieve
he married Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman reluc|tantly,
though a marriage under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances
mu&s;t above all other things ren|der
him mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, elated more than
ever by hope, and encouraged to per&s;evere
by Lady Horatia, having now too, in con|&s;equence
<PB N="85" REF="87">
of the purcha&s;e his father had
made for him, more preten&s;ions to a&s;pire to
her than his un&s;ettled fortune had before
given him; and &s;anguinely interpreting her
gentle refu&s;als, her friendly admonitions to
de&s;i&s;t, as giving him all the encouragement
&s;he could do, while her fate in regard to
Willoughby was not ab&s;olutely decided;
was on this evening particularly pre&s;&s;ing
and earne&s;t; while her languor and weari|ne&s;s,
the encouragement which &s;he was
con&s;cious &s;he &s;eemed to have given him,
her pity and even her regard for him, with
the certainty of his ardent love for her, gave
her altogether the air of li&s;tening to him fa|vourably;
and while her mind was fre|quently
fixed on Willoughby, and &s;he
hardly recollected that Montague Thorold
was talking to her, &s;he &s;eemed to be hear|ing
the latter with complacency, and ap|proving
of conver&s;ation which it was not
nece&s;&s;ary for her to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>At length the &s;hort time Lady Horatia
meant to pa&s;s at Ranelagh was over. She
<PB N="86" REF="88">
was fatigued, and Cele&s;tina rejoiced to
hear her &s;ay &s;he &s;hould go home. As
Montague Thorold and Mr. Howard were
with them, the other gentlemen remained
with the ladies who intended to &s;tay longer;
and Lady Horatia taking the arm of her
relation, left Cele&s;tina to the care of Mon|tague
Thorold; and they were in this order
proceeding towards the entrance, when
&s;tanding near one of the niches, his hat
over his eyes, and his head leaning again&s;t
the wall, they &s;aw them&s;elves clo&s;e to Wil|loughby,
who was, in that attitude, li&s;tening
to &s;ome very earne&s;t conver&s;ation from Va|va&s;our,
who &s;tood by him.</P>
<P>The croud about the entrance was con|&s;iderable;
and Cele&s;tina, holding by the
arm of Montague Thorold, was &s;o near
them, that they both at the &s;ame moment
&s;aw her. Willoughby &s;tarted as if he had
been cro&s;&s;ed by a &s;pectre; and without
waiting to look a &s;econd time, he pu&s;hed
through the croud and di&s;appeared; but
Vava&s;our came up to Cele&s;tina, and &s;aid
<PB N="87" REF="89">
in his u&s;ual way, taking abruptly the hand
that was at liberty&mdash;"You mu&s;t give <HI>me</HI>
leave, Mi&s;s De Mornay, to &s;ee you to your
carriage."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, dreading to give occa&s;ion to
any thing like altercation between him and
Thorold, an&s;wered coldly but civilly, that
&s;he thanked him; but Thorold, who had
not forgotten or forgiven the mortification
&s;he received from him at York and on
other occa&s;ions, could not now help re&s;ent|ing
what &s;eemed to be a repetition of &s;uch
in&s;ulting behaviour. He therefore, walk|ing
very ha&s;tily on with Cele&s;tina, &s;aid&mdash;"No,
Sir, there is no occa&s;ion for you to
give your&s;elf that trouble; for Mi&s;s De
Mornay is under my care."</P>
<P>"I did not mean, Sir," replied Vava|&s;our
fiercely, "to a&s;k your leave to wait on
this lady; and I beg you will not take the
liberty to addre&s;s your&s;elf to me."</P>
<P>"Pray, Mr. Vava&s;our," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
trembling, "do not per&s;ecute and terrify
me with this &s;ort of behaviour." She then
<PB N="88" REF="90">
&s;aw by his countenance, and by the eager
way in which he gra&s;ped the hand he held,
that he was very far from being &s;ober, and
her terror encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I did not mean to per&s;ecute or terrify
you," cried he: "no, by heaven! But
damme if I can with any temper &s;ee that fel|low
always at your ear, and affecting to be
favoured. Come, come, leave the pedant
to his meditations, and don't for&s;ake your
old friends. The petticoats that he is to
wear are his protection."</P>
<P>"And this lady's pre&s;ence, Sir," &s;aid
Thorold, "is your's, or be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hould
an&s;wer you in a very different way."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, now alarmed even to agony by
the menacing look of Vava&s;our, who quitted
her hand and &s;tepped before Thorold,
&s;creamed out to Mr. Howard and Lady
Horatia; but the croud had &s;o far divided
them from her, that neither heard her, and
before &s;he could effectually interfere to pre|vent
it, &s;uch words had pa&s;&s;ed between
Vava&s;our and Thorold, as nothing but blood
<PB N="89" REF="91">
is, by the laws of honour, &s;upppo&s;ed to
atone for. Cele&s;tina, who heard them in
affright not to be de&s;cribed, now di&s;engaged
her&s;elf from both of them, and not know|ing
what &s;he did, only having &s;ome con|fu&s;ed
idea that &s;he might meet Captain
Thorold in the room, &s;he ran back thither
alone.</P>
<P>Her beauty and her terror, whether it
was thought real or affected, gave her, in
the opinion of the fir&s;t groups &s;he met, the
appearance of &s;ome young creature de&s;irous
to attract attention. Three or four young
men &s;urrounded her, and enquired what
&s;ervice they could do her. Breathle&s;s and
ready to faint, &s;he an&s;wered that &s;he was in
&s;earch of Captain Thorold.</P>
<P>"Egad," cried one of them, "Captain
Thorold is a devili&s;h lucky fellow."</P>
<P>"And a very ta&s;tele&s;s one," &s;aid ano|ther,
"to leave &s;uch a lovely creature to
&s;eek for him."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina now under&s;tood how entirely
they mi&s;took her; and collecting &s;ome pre|&s;ence
<PB N="90" REF="92">
of mind, &s;aid&mdash;"For heaven's &s;ake,
gentlemen, a&s;&s;i&s;t me to find him. His
brother is engaged in a quarrel: a quarrel,
I fear, on my account&mdash;and&mdash;"</P>
<P>She would have gone on, but unhappily
for her the party of men who &s;urrounded
her were all of that de&s;cription which are
called bucks, who fancy they di&s;tingui&s;h
them&s;elves by &s;hewing how little they de|&s;erve
the character of men. One or two of
the&s;e hearing of a quarrel, found they had
no di&s;po&s;ition to engage where there might
be trouble or danger, and therefore walked
away; but three others had now time to
con&s;ider the eminent beauty of Cele&s;tina,
and to have &s;ettled in their own minds that
&s;he was a girl without character, which her
being alone, and even what &s;he had told
them of a quarrel on her account, &s;eemed
to authori&s;e: they were therefore all deter|mined
not to let her go; and far from
thinking of relieving the terror in which
they &s;aw her, and which they indeed be|lieved
to be a mere piece of acting, two
<PB N="91" REF="93">
of them took her arms within theirs, and
held with her &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e as encrea&s;ed
her alarm almo&s;t to di&s;traction. She now
knew not what &s;he &s;aid. Terror for her&s;elf
had &s;o mingled it&s;elf with her fears of what
might happen between Vava&s;our and Tho|rold,
that &s;he &s;ometimes angrily entreated
her per&s;ecutors to relea&s;e her, then humbly
be&s;ought them to &s;ee for Captain Thorold,
till at length, as they led her again towards
the door, her fears were become in&s;up|portable,
and &s;hrieking, &s;he entreated them
rather to kill her than expo&s;e her to &s;uch
horror as &s;he felt. At this moment, how|ever,
by a &s;udden &s;pring, &s;he di&s;engaged
her&s;elf: Willoughby was returning alone
along the pa&s;&s;age: &s;he &s;aw him, and threw
her&s;elf into his arms.</P>
<P>"Save me, &s;ave me, Willoughby!" was
all &s;he could utter, before, quite overcome
with variety of terrors, &s;he became almo&s;t
&s;en&s;ele&s;s; her head re&s;ting on his &s;houlder,
and his arms &s;upporting her.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">
He looked &s;ternly on the young men,
and demanded the occa&s;ion of the lady's
alarm. They replied that they knew no|thing
more than that &s;he had run into the
room alone, enquiring for a Captain &s;ome|body,
and that they had endeavoured to
find the cau&s;e of her fright and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.
Willoughby, who did not believe this, but
who was more &s;olicitous to recover the
fainting Cele&s;tina than to puni&s;h the&s;e idle
boys, waved with his hand for them to be
gone, and they immediately obeyed; for
it was the defencele&s;s only they had courage
to in&s;ult. Willoughby then, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of a gentleman whom he happened to
know, led Cele&s;tina, who was ju&s;t &s;en&s;ible,
into the room where the ladies cloaks are
received; and while his friend ran to get
her a gla&s;s of water, Willoughby placed
him&s;elf by her, and with one hand round
her wai&s;t, &s;upported her with the other;
nor could he forbear, as he gazed on her
pale but &s;till lovely countenance, pre&s;&s;ing
her to that heart which had been &s;o long
<PB N="93" REF="95">
fondly devoted to her. In a very &s;hort
time &s;he drew a deep &s;igh; and recovering
recollection, begged his pardon, in a voice
hardly articulate, for the trouble &s;he had
given him. She remembered that to the
hu&s;band, the lover of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
it mu&s;t be trouble, and &s;he withdrew her|&s;elf
from his arms before he could a&s;k her,
(&s;o ab&s;orbed was he in the mingled &s;en&s;a|tions
of pain and plea&s;ure,) what had occa|&s;ioned
the alarm in which he had &s;een her.
With a &s;igh &s;till deeper than her's, he now
made this enquiry. She an&s;wered, but not
very di&s;tinctly, that high words had ari&s;en
between Mr. Vava&s;our and Mr. Montague
Thorold, and that not able to check their
impetuo&s;ity, nor to overtake Lady Horatia
and Mr. Howard, who were gone on be|fore,
&s;he had fooli&s;hly run back into the
room to find &s;omebody who might part
them, when tho&s;e young men had &s;ur|rounded
and in&s;ulted her, till in her fear &s;he
knew not what &s;he did.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">
"And all this terror&mdash;all this exce&s;&s;ive
apprehen&s;ion, was for Mr. Montague Tho|rold?"
&s;aid Willoughby, in a faultering
but not a tender voice: then, as if he had
di&s;covered nothing but what he had before
known enough of to be ea&s;y under, he
&s;eemed at once to repre&s;s all appearance of
intere&s;t as far as it related to Cele&s;tina, and
&s;aid, with forced coldne&s;s&mdash;"I dare &s;ay,
Madam, you have nothing to apprehend
for his precious life. However, I will &s;eek
my friend Vava&s;our, and take care at lea&s;t
for to-night that it goes no farther, if you
will tell me where I can find him, and whi|ther
I &s;hall have the honour of conducting you."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was heart &s;truck by the manner
in which this was uttered. She turned her
expre&s;&s;ive eyes on his, to enquire whether
he could really behave thus cruelly towards
her; his eyes met her's; but as if he could
not bear her looks he turned them away
towards the door, where his friend now en|tered,
with the water, and almo&s;t at the
<PB N="95" REF="97">
&s;ame moment Mr. Howard came in, and
told her that Lady Horatia had been in
great alarm at her not following her to the
coach, where &s;he now waited for her. She
did not give him time to fini&s;h the &s;entence,
before &s;he eagerly a&s;ked if he had &s;een Mr.
Montague Thorold.</P>
<P>"Seen him," cried Mr. Howard; "no
certainly. Is he not with you?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina would then have related what
had happened; but her returning appre|hen&s;ions
that &s;omething fatal might have
already been the con&s;equence, and the look
with which Willoughby &s;urveyed her, en|tirely
deprived her of the power of &s;peech;
and Willoughby him&s;elf in a few words re|lated
to Mr. Howard what &s;he had told
him. "I do not know," added he, "what
ground Mi&s;s de Mornay has had for the
alarm &s;he has been in; but I know Vava&s;our
was not &s;ober, and po&s;&s;ibly may have been
wrong headed: it will therefore be nece&s;|&s;ary
perhaps for me to enquire after him;
and as you Madam, &s;eem to be now re|covered,
<PB N="96" REF="98">
and are &s;afe in the protection of
Mr. Howard, I will wi&s;h you good night."
Having hurried over the&s;e words, he bowed
to Mr. Howard, then with equal coolne&s;s
to Cele&s;tina, and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>A &s;hower of tears, the fir&s;t &s;he had been
able to &s;hed, fell from the eyes of Cele&s;tina
as &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of him. The&s;e tears how|ever,
and the water &s;he had drank, a little
relieved her; and Mr. Howard again re|pre&s;enting
the unea&s;ine&s;s in which he had
left Lady Horatia, &s;he collected &s;trength
enough to avail her&s;elf of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he
offered her; and leaning on his arm,
reached the coach, where &s;he was compelled,
however unequal to the recital, to relate to
Lady Horatia what had happened within
the twenty minutes, (for more had not
elap&s;ed,) that &s;he had lo&s;t &s;ight of her.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen|&s;ions
for Montague Thorold; and thought,
with great appearance of truth, that unle&s;s
he had gone immediately away with Vava|&s;our
to decide their difference that evening,
<PB N="97" REF="99">
he would have &s;ought them again, and have
relieved them from the extreme apprehen|&s;ions
which he mu&s;t imagine they mu&s;t be
under on his account.&mdash;The&s;e conjectures,
which were but too well founded, and which
they had no means of &s;atisfying, kept Lady
Horatia and Cele&s;tina awake the whole night:
towards morning, the former, who was le&s;s
deeply intere&s;ted; and more accu&s;tomed to
the painful events of life than Cele&s;tina,
found &s;ome repo&s;e; but Cele&s;tina her&s;elf
was up by break of day, li&s;tening to every
noi&s;e in the &s;treet, and trembling every mo|ment
lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould hear of &s;ome fatal acci|dent:
and her reflections, which no longer
offered her any thing to hope, were bu&s;y in
repre&s;enting and magnifying all the evils
which &s;he had to apprehend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e as to the extraordi|nary
di&s;appearance of Montague Thorold
with Vava&s;our the evening before, la&s;ted till
near ten o'clock; when, as Lady Horatia
and Cele&s;tina were &s;itting at a breakfa&s;t|table,
where the unea&s;ine&s;s they were both
under did not allow them to eat, a &s;er|vant
announced Captain Thorold.&mdash;Cele&s;|tina
turned pale as death at the name; but
there was no time to expre&s;s any part of the
fear &s;he felt before he entered.</P>
<P>His air was a&s;&s;uming, confident, and what
the French call <HI>glorieux.</HI> But from that Ce|le&s;tina
could judge nothing; for &s;he knew
he had too little regard for his brother to have
been much affected at any thing that might
have befallen him. He paid his compliments
in the common form to Lady Horatia, who
<PB N="99" REF="101">
was too much concerned to be able to an&s;wer
them; and then turning to the &s;ilent, trem|bling
Cele&s;tina, he &s;aid, with an unfeeling
&s;mile, "Well, Madam, your young cham|pion
is living."</P>
<P>"Good God," cried Cele&s;tina, "has he
ever then been in danger?" "Yes," replied
the Captain, "he has been in all the danger
that a man can be who has a brace of pi&s;tols
fired at him; and is now in as much as is
u&s;ual to a man who has a ball lodged in his
&s;houlder."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina could not &s;peak; &s;he could with
difficulty breathe: but Lady Horatia now
eagerly enquired the particulars, and learned,
that in con&s;equence of violent language
that pa&s;&s;ed between Vava&s;our and Montague
Thorold, after Cele&s;tina left them the pre|ceding
evening, a challenge had pa&s;&s;ed, and
a meeting been appointed in Chel&s;ea Fields, at
&s;even o'clock in the morning;&mdash;that Thorold,
after quitting Vava&s;our, had in vain endea|voured
to find out Lady Horatia and Ce|le&s;tina,
and meeting his brother, and relating
to him what had happened, was by him di&s;|&s;uaded
from attempting it, as he could not
<PB N="100" REF="102">
&s;ee them without informing them of what
had pa&s;&s;ed, and was yet to happen; that he
had therefore gone home with Captain Tho|rold,
who had, at the appointed time, attended
him to the field, where Vava&s;our was with a
friend; and where, the preliminaries being
&s;oon &s;ettled, each fired without effect; but
neither declaring them&s;elves &s;atisfied, they
fired again, and Montague Thorold received
a ball in his &s;houlder, which was not extracted
when his brother left him at his lodgings,
whither he was immediately conveyed, and
where he was attended by an eminent &s;urgeon.
"And is he in danger, Sir," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
with all that tremulous tenderne&s;s in her
voice that her extreme &s;en&s;ibility gave her&mdash;"Is
he in danger? is he in pain?"</P>
<P>Captain Thorold gave her a look which
&s;eemed to &s;ay "Humph"&mdash;it <HI>is</HI> true, then, that
you are violently in love with this, brother of
mine: and then, an&s;wered&mdash;"The &s;urgeon,
on who&s;e &s;kill I have great rea&s;on to rely,
does not &s;eem to think him in danger; but
till the ball is extracted, which will be attend|ed
with pain enough, it is not, I fancy, ea&s;y
to &s;peak very po&s;itively.&mdash;However, Mi&s;s de
<PB N="101" REF="103">
Mornay, Montague wont complain of the
pain, let it be as &s;evere as it will, while he
recollects that he &s;uffers in your defence, and
hears, what I &s;hall not fail to relate, how
dearly you are intere&s;ted for him."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina could not &s;ay that this unlucky
affair did not originate about her; indeed,
&s;he had not at that moment &s;trength to enter
on any explanation; nor could &s;he deny, that
&s;he was extremely concerned, or make Cap|tain
Thorold comprehend that for a &s;tranger,
under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, &s;he &s;hould have
been greatly, if not equally &s;orry:&mdash;As to
Lady Horatia, who hoped that this accident
would operate deci&s;ively on behalf of Mon|tague,
&s;he rather encouraged than contra|dicted
the idea that his brother &s;eemed to
entertain of Cele&s;tina's partiality towards him:
And now the Captain, with as much uncon|cern
as if nothing had happened, &s;eemed only
de&s;irous of di&s;playing his own con&s;equence
and his own perfections: as if to convince
them both, that for a woman, who had ever
&s;een him and his brother together, to prefer
the latter, was an in&s;tance of mo&s;t terrible want
of di&s;cernment. Several times was Cele&s;tina,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
who could hardly &s;upport her&s;elf, on the point
of withdrawing; but &s;he thought, that were
&s;he to quit the room, it would look &s;till more
as if &s;he was &s;inking under her apprehen&s;ions;
and &s;he be&s;ides feared, that were &s;he ab&s;ent,
the zeal of Lady Horatia would induce her
to explain to Captain Thorold more of her
wi&s;hes and projects in regard to her and his
brother than, feeling as &s;he did the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity
of their ever taking place, ought in di&s;|cretion
or in ju&s;tice to be talked of.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, wretched and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
as &s;he was, &s;he had yet re&s;olution enough to
remain in her place; till at length Captain
Thorold, having paraded about him&s;elf for
near half an hour, withdrew.</P>
<P>Then it was, that, from the conver&s;ation
of her friend, Cele&s;tina under&s;tood how much
&s;uch an event would be expected to affect her
&s;entiments in favour of Montague Thorold;
and how impo&s;&s;ible Lady Horatia con&s;idered it
for her, after all the &s;ufferings he mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain
on her account, to delay rewarding tho&s;e &s;uf|ferings
and his long and ardent attachment to
her longer than till his recovery: of which,
notwith&s;tanding what Captain Thorold had
<PB N="103" REF="105">
&s;aid of the po&s;&s;ibility of danger, &s;he &s;eemed
not to doubt; though &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great
concern for the pain he mu&s;t endure, and
great anxiety to be informed of his actual &s;i|tuation.
To all that &s;he &s;aid, Cele&s;tina hard|ly
an&s;wered a word&mdash;her heart was too much
oppre&s;&s;ed; and &s;he could &s;ay nothing that
would not appear either like in&s;en&s;ibility, in|gratitude,
or like the anxious &s;olicitude of
love. She wi&s;hed to avoid either: &s;he wi&s;hed
to be alone; and though the determination
Lady Horatia almo&s;t immediately formed to
vi&s;it Montague Thorold her&s;elf, was a mea|&s;ure
which mu&s;t &s;trongly confirm all the re|ports
that &s;he wi&s;hed to di&s;courage, yet it
relea&s;ed her to her own reflections, and &s;he
was glad at that moment to &s;ee her friend
depart.</P>
<P>Her own reflections, to which &s;he was now
left, were mo&s;t unea&s;y&mdash;She knew that &s;uch
an affair mu&s;t unavoidably be much and im|mediately
talked of: &s;he knew how much it
would be mi&s;repre&s;ented, and what conclu|&s;ions
would be made upon it. The expre&s;&s;ion
u&s;ed by Willoughby the evening before &s;till
vibrated in her ears: "What! and is all this
<PB N="104" REF="106">
terror, all this apprehen&s;ion, for Montague
Thorold." It was di&s;plea&s;ing then to him
that &s;he &s;hould feel an intere&s;t for Montague
Thorold&mdash;and the little tenderne&s;s he had ap|peared
to &s;hew her, was repre&s;&s;ed the moment
he under&s;tood who was the &s;ubject of her
alarm&mdash;con&s;cious that hopele&s;s as &s;he had long
been of his affection, and &s;ubmitting to the
nece&s;&s;ity of their &s;eparation, &s;he had yet never
be&s;towed on another the heart he had re&s;igned,
&s;he could not bear to think how much every
circum&s;tance had contributed to make him
think, that &s;he had lightly given it to the
fir&s;t candidate; nor could her mind dwell
without extreme concern, on the pain this
affair would give the elder Mr. Thorold,
who&s;e hopes were, &s;he well knew, centered in
his younge&s;t &s;on, and who would not only
be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ickne&s;s and danger to
which he had thus expo&s;ed him&s;elf, but he hurt
at his having acted &s;o contrary to tho&s;e prin|ciples
he had always endeavoured to incul|cate,
as to giving or receiving a challenge.&mdash;Nor
were the &s;ufferings of Montague Thorold
him&s;elf the lea&s;t part of her concern: &s;he
apprehended he might be long confined in
<PB N="105" REF="107">
great pain; he might perhaps lo&s;e his arm,
or even his life: and while &s;he regretted the
ra&s;hne&s;s which had been the occa&s;ion of this
hazard, &s;he could not but acknowledge, that
it was impo&s;&s;ible a young man of &s;pirit could
otherwi&s;e have an&s;wered the unprovoked fe|rocity
of Vava&s;our.</P>
<P>Of him &s;he thought with terror; and
knowing that he was capable of any impro|priety
in the humour he was now in, &s;he gave
immediate orders, that if he came &s;he &s;hould
be denied.</P>
<P>All the circum&s;tances of the preceding
evening, which the fear that had be&s;et her
during the latter part of it had for a while
driven from her recollection, now returned to
it; and the repeated intelligence &s;he had re|ceived
throughout the day of Willoughby's
marriage, all the particulars with which it had
been related, the happy looks of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
the proud triumph that &s;at on the
features of her mother, and the forced friend|&s;hip
with which Lady Molyneux &s;eemed to
have connected her&s;elf with per&s;ons who were
&s;o lately the objects of her aver&s;ion, all con|firmed
<PB N="106" REF="108">
the reports that were in circulation, &s;o
as to put their truth beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>In a few days &s;he was to hear of their actually
being married: to li&s;ten again to the detail of
their nuptial &s;plendor, perhaps to witne&s;s them:
&s;he was to be &s;urrounded by a thou&s;and im|pertinent
people who would enquire and talk to
her about the duel; and, with an heart &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ed,
mu&s;t attend to them with patience,
and an&s;wer them with civility. The whole
pro&s;pect before her was too unplea&s;ant; &s;he
fancied it impo&s;&s;ible to be endured; and re|&s;olved
to attempt, though at the hazard of
appearing ungrateful, perhaps of di&s;obliging
her be&s;t and almo&s;t her only friend, to &s;o|licit
leave to go down to Je&s;&s;y, at lea&s;t till the
public conver&s;ation &s;hould have been turned
to &s;ome other topic, and the public curio&s;ity
no longer excited by the marriage of Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, or the rencontre of Vava&s;our
and Thorold.</P>
<P>The natural &s;oftne&s;s of her heart made her,
among all the&s;e &s;ources of peculiar unea&s;ine&s;s,
really and tenderly intere&s;ted for Montague
Thorold: and &s;he awaited the return of Lady
Horatia with as much &s;olicitude as &s;he could
<PB N="107" REF="109">
have felt if a beloved brother had been in
&s;uch a &s;ituation: perhaps &s;he would have felt
more for nobody but Willoughby him&s;elf.
It was, therefore, a great relief to her hara&s;&s;ed
&s;pirits, when &s;he heard, that while Captain
Thorold had been in Park-&s;treet, the bullet
had been extracted; that no bone had been
injured by it, and that he was in as good a
way as could be expected; his &s;urgeon de|claring,
that from the nature of the wound,
and the good con&s;titution of his patient, he.
thought him in no danger, and &s;hould pro|bably,
at the end of a fortnight, di&s;mi&s;s him
with his arm in a &s;ling.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction Cele&s;tina expre&s;&s;ed on this
account, was not however increa&s;ed, when
Lady Horatia added, that far from complain|ing
of his &s;ufferings, he exulted and rejoiced
in them; flattering him&s;elf that &s;he for whom
he could willingly have ri&s;ked an hundred
lives if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, would feel
&s;ome pity for him; and knowing how much
power, in &s;uch a heart as hers, that &s;enti|ment
had to produce others &s;till more fa|vourable.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110">
Lady Horatia then went on to &s;ay very
&s;eriou&s;ly to Cele&s;tina, that &s;he ought no longer
to trifle with &s;uch a man, but re&s;olve imme|diately
to give him her hand: not only as the
reward of his merit, but to preclude the dan|gerous
preten&s;ions of Vava&s;our: "to who&s;e
per&s;everance," &s;aid &s;he, "no refu&s;al, no re|pul&s;e
&s;eems to put an end."</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t Madam," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, <HI>did</HI> I
ever trifle with Mr. Thorold&mdash;&s;urely I never
meant it&mdash;&s;o far from it, I have an hundred
times regretted that your Lady&s;hip's partia|lity
towards him, and the influence you have
and ought to have over me, have combined
to keep him in an error, which all my candid
dealing with him has not had the power to
refute. I have told him, whenever he has
urged the &s;ubject, that he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
my e&s;teem and of my friend&s;hip, but that
for my love I have it not to be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"But he is content, my dear, with your
e&s;teem, with your friend&s;hip; and knows
that, in &s;uch a heart as yours, love will follow
his attachment to you; e&s;pecially as you <HI>now</HI>
&s;urely cannot alledge that any other per&s;on
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it."</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">
Cele&s;tina, too con&s;cious of all the&s;e circum|&s;tances
that ought long &s;ince to have induced
her to withdraw it from Willoughby, yet
equally con&s;cious that &s;he could never feel for
another that degree of affection of which
&s;he had been &s;en&s;ible for him, was &s;ilent a
moment or two, and then &s;aid, "Dear Lady
Horatia, why mu&s;t I marry at all? while
you afford me your protection can I be
happier; and &s;hould I be unhappy enough
to lo&s;e it, &s;hould I not be more likely to meet
content even with my &s;mall and humble for|tune,
if I remained &s;ingle, than if I gave my
hand where I have no power to be&s;tow my
heart."</P>
<P>"I am amazed," replied Lady Horatia,
"that with &s;uch very good &s;en&s;e as you po&s;|&s;e&s;s,
you would accu&s;ton your&s;elf to cheri&s;h
the&s;e childi&s;h and girli&s;h notions: what is this
love, without feeling all the violence of which,
you &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;ible to be happy?"</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," cried Cele&s;tina, inter|rupting
her, "have I not heard you &s;ay, that
you once was &s;en&s;ible of it your&s;elf; and that
having been compelled to quit the man of
your choice, you con&s;idered &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="110" REF="112">
as a heavy affliction, and that it rendered mo&s;t
of the occurrences of your &s;ub&s;equent life
indifferent to you?"</P>
<P>Yes, you have heard me &s;ay &s;o&mdash;I merely
acknowledged a folly, a weakne&s;s, which I
pretended not to defend in my&s;elf, and cer|tainly
not to encourage in you.&mdash;What has
been the life of this man, whom I called, in
the romantic &s;implicity of &s;ixteen, my fir&s;t
love? When my father parted us, and I was
compelled by his authority to give my hand
to General Howard, he was a younger bro|ther,
with very little fortune. In a twelve-month
afterwards, the death of his elder bro|ther
and an uncle gave him a very large for|tune;
and he quitted the navy, where he had,
for &s;o young a man, highly di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf, and with his profe&s;&s;ion he &s;eemed to
re&s;ign his virtues. He married a woman to|wards
whom he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf indifferent;
and who&s;e only recommendation was a for|tune
nearly as large as his own. To her he
behaved with neglect, which &s;he repaid with
&s;corn and infidelity. They &s;eemed to agree
in nothing but mutual extravagance; till at
length they parted, and he now lives in
<PB N="111" REF="113">
France the greate&s;t part of the year; at other
times wanders about the world, to gratify his
ta&s;te for variety, and fly from tho&s;e corro&s;ive
reflections which mu&s;t pur&s;ue him who has
ruined his health and his fortune by de|bauchery.
Can I, when I con&s;ider all this, help
de&s;pi&s;ing my&s;elf for the pain I felt at being
&s;eparated from &s;uch a man; and ought I not
rather to rejoice at what once appeared an
in&s;upportable misfortune?</P>
<P>"Ah, Madam," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "it is well
if by the&s;e reflections you have been enabled
to conquer tho&s;e remains of u&s;ele&s;s regret
which might otherwi&s;e have embittered your
life: but give me leave to a&s;k, &s;ince there is
now no danger of renewing them, give me
leave to a&s;k, whether you &s;incerely believe
that this gentleman, had he married you,
would have pa&s;&s;ed a life as blameable? You
have told me that he was pa&s;&s;ionately
attached to you: you now &s;ay, that to the
lady he married he was indifferent: &s;urely to
that may be imputed all his errors.&mdash;His
mind became unhinged when he lo&s;t her to
whom it was devoted, and he aggravated
him&s;elf the cruelty of his de&s;tiny. To you
<PB N="112" REF="114">
he might have been an excellent hu&s;band,
becau&s;e he loved you; but lo&s;ing the po&s;&s;|ibility
of being happy, he lo&s;t the wi&s;h to be
re&s;pectable; and &s;ince he could not live with
you, cared not with whom or how he
lived."</P>
<P>"There may be &s;ome truth," &s;aid Lady
Horatia, "in your remarks; but to be tole|rably
ea&s;y, Cele&s;tina, in this world, you
mu&s;t learn to be more of an Optimi&s;t; and to
believe, that whatever happens, could not, nor
ought not to have been otherwi&s;e. Thus the
interference of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, whatever
might have been her motives, has &s;aved you
from a marriage that might have been a hide|ous
crime; thus, not to enumerate other in|&s;tances
that mu&s;t occur to your recollection;
thus, the wild brutality of Vava&s;our, and
even the wound of Montague, will all contri|bute
finally to good, and produce that hap|pine&s;s
for you with him, which I do not be|lieve
you would have found with any other
per&s;on."</P>
<P>To this doctrine Cele&s;tina could not agree.
But the fear and fatigue &s;he had within the la&s;t
twenty-four hours undergone, di&s;qualified her
<PB N="113" REF="115">
for any farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject at pre|&s;ent,
or for the attempt &s;he meant to make to
prevail on Lady Horatia to allow her to go
down to Je&s;&s;y for a few weeks; her eyes were
indeed &s;o heavy, her complexion &s;o pale in
con&s;equence of her long agitation, that now
the immediate fears for Montague Thorold's
life were over, Lady Horatia advi&s;ed her to
take &s;ome repo&s;e; a propo&s;al which &s;he glad|ly
accepted; and in de&s;pite of the variety of
unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;till laboured under, exhau&s;ted
nature obtained for her a few hours re&s;pite in
&s;leep: though &s;he was, in her previous con|templations,
&s;o far from a&s;&s;enting heartily to
the re&s;igned philo&s;ophy of Lady Horatia,
that &s;he thought with angui&s;h of the fate of
Willoughby, who might, &s;he feared, by the
&s;ame di&s;appointments in the early part of his
life, become quite unlike what he once was;
and from his cruel neglect of her &s;ince he
had been in London, &s;he already fancied &s;he
&s;aw that this change had begun.</P>
<P>But could &s;he for one moment have &s;een
the real &s;tate of that mind who&s;e virtues &s;he
believed to be tarni&s;hed, &s;he would have found
it as worthy as ever of her tenderne&s;s, and
<PB N="114" REF="116">
entitled to all her pity. Tormented by an
affection which he could not indulge for one
woman, and entangled by a &s;eries of perver&s;e
events in an engagement with another; em|barra&s;&s;ed
in his circum&s;tances, and di&s;content|ed
with him&s;elf; his whole life pa&s;&s;ed in a
continual tumult of contending pa&s;&s;ions; and
whatever means he took to calm and mitigate
them &s;eemed only to irritate his &s;ufferings.&mdash;Thus,
when he left his own lodgings on the
day of his interview with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
and his meeting Cele&s;tina, he went to the
hotel where Vava&s;our u&s;ually lived when he
was in town; and where it happened that a
party of their mutual acquaintance that day
dined: this prevented his having any con|ver&s;ation
with Vava&s;our, which, though it
might have contributed but little to relieve
his vexation as to Montague Thorold, would
have ea&s;ed his heart by unburthening it to
his friend; and Vava&s;our drank &s;o much, that
there was afterwards no hopes of his hearing
him rationally. With him he was prevailed
upon, at a late hour, to go to Ranelagh;&mdash;where
he &s;aw Cele&s;tina again with the very
man to whom he had been &s;o repeatedly told
<PB N="115" REF="117">
&s;he had engaged her&s;elf; and there, though
Cele&s;tina happened not to &s;ee them together,
he was compelled to take &s;everal turns with
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, her daughter, and his
&s;i&s;ter; thus confirming, by his appearance in
public with the two former, what it was in|deed
too late to retract, though he had already
mo&s;t bitterly repented it.</P>
<P>The quarrel between Vava&s;our and Mon|tague
Thorold, of which his &s;uddenly quitting
the place where he met Cele&s;tina was partly
the occa&s;ion (for had he &s;taid he might have
prevented it), added to the conviction he
now had that Thorold was very &s;oon to be her
hu&s;band; and increa&s;ed his vexation, in de|&s;pite
of all that rea&s;on could &s;ay to counteract
the effect of it. That rea&s;on repeatedly a&s;ked
him&mdash;if Cele&s;tina had really been brought
up and acknowledged as his &s;i&s;ter, and had
with &s;o &s;mall a fortune been addre&s;&s;ed by Tho|rold,
and her&s;elf approved him, whether he
could in &s;uch a ca&s;e have made any rea&s;onable
objection? He was compelled to an&s;wer no!
yet his heart revolted again&s;t the a&s;&s;ent which
common &s;en&s;e urged him to give to a mar|riage
which differed in nothing from what
<PB N="116" REF="118">
would then have been the ca&s;e, but in early
prejudice. He never could learn to con&s;ider
Cele&s;tina as related to him by blood; nor did
all the pains he had taken to learn the truth
convince him of it; though he dared not act
as if he wholly di&s;believed it. Yet &s;o per|ver&s;e
is an heart under the influence of &s;uch
pa&s;&s;ion as he felt, that while he had relin|qui&s;hed
her, and agreed to marry another, left
that relation&s;hip &s;hould really exi&s;t, he dete&s;t|ed
Thorold for having, as he believed, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf of tho&s;e affections, which, other|wi&s;e
than as her brother, he had owned he
dared not claim.</P>
<P>When he left Cele&s;tina under the care of
Mr. Howard at Ranelagh the preceding even|ing,
he had gone, as he promi&s;ed, in &s;earch
of Vava&s;our; but not finding him any where
about the room, or in the avenues to the Ro|tunda,
he had gone to his lodgings, and
waited there till near four in the morning.&mdash;He
then left orders with his &s;ervant to &s;end
for him the moment his ma&s;ter came; but
Vava&s;our, in&s;tead of returning to his lodg|ings
at all that evening, &s;lept &s;omewhere el&s;e;
and only called there in a hackney-coach at
<PB N="117" REF="119">
half pa&s;t five o'clock to take his pi&s;tols; and
his &s;ervant being ordered to attend him,
with the &s;urgeon, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of
his man giving Willoughby notice; and of
cour&s;e he could do nothing to &s;top a ren|contre
of which he did not hear till after it
was over.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, who then came to him, was not
&s;ober: and Willoughby &s;aw, with more con|cern
than &s;urpri&s;e, that the habits his friend
had acquired &s;ince his la&s;t ab&s;ence were be|coming
inveterate, and were ruining alike his
con&s;titution, his fortune, and his under&s;tand|ing.
Though he him&s;elf dete&s;ted Montague
Thorold, and cur&s;ed the hour when he had
put Cele&s;tina under the protection of his fa|ther,
and by that means thrown him in her
way; he was; too generous, even to an enemy,
not to feel that Vava&s;our had behaved
with unwarrantable brutality; and notwith|&s;tanding
his long friend&s;hip for him, he felt
too, that had he been as &s;ucce&s;sful as he be|lieved.
Thorold to be, all that friend&s;hip
would have been cancelled.</P>
<P>He was vexed, however, at the conver&s;a|tion
which this fooli&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t occa&s;ion;
<PB N="118" REF="120">
and in which he knew the name of Cele&s;tina
mu&s;t be joined with that of Montague Tho|rold:
and when Vava&s;our &s;poke with &s;ome
triumph of his having cha&s;ti&s;ed the young
pedant, Willoughby, with a peevi&s;hne&s;s very
unu&s;ual with him, &s;aid, he heartily wi&s;hed he
had let it alone.</P>
<P>From the little conver&s;ation he had with
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth the evening before, he
found &s;he expected him to wait on them the
next day. Reluctantly, and with an aching
heart, he had then given a &s;ort of promi&s;e, and
with &s;till more regret he recollected it. The
&s;un now never ro&s;e for him but to bring him
a renewal of mi&s;ery; and his dejection never
left him, but to give place to paroxy&s;ms of
pa&s;&s;ion and fits of fruitle&s;s de&s;pair.</P>
<P>As the hour approached when he knew
he was expected at the hou&s;e of his uncle,
his unwillingne&s;s to go increa&s;ed. Farn|ham,
who now anxiou&s;ly watched all his
looks, &s;aw a deeper gloom come upon him:
he &s;aw him take out &s;everal letters, read them,
replace them, then &s;natch up a pen, write a
few lines, and hurry a-cro&s;s the room as if
undecided what to do. At length he wrote
<PB N="119" REF="121">
a few lines, &s;ealed the note, and put it in his
pocket. Farnham had heard a great deal of
the duel that had happened the evening be|fore,
and knew it was about Mi&s;s de Mornay,
and that a gentleman had been wounded dan|gerou&s;ly.
He had heard conver&s;ation be|tween
his ma&s;ter and Vava&s;our, and &s;uppo&s;ed,
from their manner, that they parted in anger.
This circum&s;tance put it in his head, which
was rather an hone&s;t than a clear one, that
&s;ome other affair of honour, in which his
ma&s;ter was concerned, was &s;till in agitation;
and he &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded him&s;elf of
this, that he determined to ob&s;erve narrowly
every thing that happened, and to take all
po&s;&s;ible precautions again&s;t his ma&s;ter's hav|ing
&s;uch an accident be&s;al him as had hap|pened
to Mr. Montague Thorold,</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he attached him&s;elf very
clo&s;ely to the hole in the door between the
dining-room and the bed-chamber; and when
he was &s;ummoned, by a furious ring, to at|tend
him, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of fir&s;t
&s;lipping &s;oftly down &s;tairs, and then running
up to a&s;k his commands.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">
Willoughby gave him two notes, and a&s;k|ed
if the groom was within. On hearing he
he was not: "Then go your&s;elf," &s;aid he,
"with the&s;e two notes: no an&s;wer is required
to either: return as &s;oon as you can."&mdash;Farnham
promi&s;ing to be expeditious, left
him; and reading the directions, found one to
be, to Mi&s;s de Mornay, the other to Mr.
Vava&s;our. This, with all he knew of his
ma&s;ter's former attachment and embarra&s;&s;ing
doubts about Cele&s;tina, and all that had hap|pened
that evening before, and that morn|ing,
convinced him beyond a doubt, that
another duel would happen, which he ima|gined
it to be his peculiar duty to prevent.&mdash;He
was not very fertile in expedients: but it
occurred to him that the be&s;t way would be
to carry both the&s;e letters, and at the &s;ame
time communicate his fears, to Sir Philip and
Lady Molyneux.</P>
<P>Sir Philip was not at home; but Lady
Molyneux, on hearing he wanted to &s;peak to
her; ordered him up.</P>
<P>He opened his bu&s;ine&s;s with great gravity;
detailed all the cau&s;e he had for apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="121" REF="123">
from his ma&s;ter's behaviour, and produced
the two notes.</P>
<P>Lady Molyneux affected to agree with him
as to the ju&s;tice of his fears, and to com|mend
his prudence and fidelity; &s;he then told
him &s;he thought it would be the be&s;t way to
open the letters, which, as &s;he happened to
have a &s;eal with the Willoughby arms, the
&s;ame as her brother's, &s;he could ea&s;ily re|&s;eal;
and &s;end, if they contained nothing of
what they &s;u&s;pected; and if they did, that it
would be proper to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>Poor Farnham, trembling as he &s;poke, a&s;|&s;ented
to all this, only entreating her to take
care that his ma&s;ter might never know it. This
&s;he readily promi&s;ed; and, taking all the
blame upon her&s;elf, bade him retire while
&s;he opened the letters, and come up again
when &s;he rang.</P>
<P>She then read them.&mdash;That to Vava&s;our
was merely to put off an appointment for the
evening, which Willoughby found him&s;elf
unable to attend.&mdash;That to Cele&s;tina ran thus:</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125">
This letter, cold and unlike his former
&s;tyle to Cele&s;tina as it was, his &s;i&s;ter imme|diately
re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s. Her hatred to
Cele&s;tina was increa&s;ed to a degree of inve|terate
malignity of which it was difficult to
conceive her haughty <HI>indolence</HI> was capable;
and this aro&s;e chie&s;ly from the admiration &s;he
every where &s;aw her beauty excited, which
was a point in which &s;he could not bear to be
excelled. Convinced as &s;he internally was,
that Cele&s;tina was an orphan &s;tranger, brought
up on her mother's charity, &s;he cho&s;e rather to
leave the report of their relation&s;hip uncontra|dicted,
than to &s;ee her united to her brother,
and put on a footing with her&s;elf, to which
that equivocal relation&s;hip could give her no
claim: and &s;ince the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of her letter to
Willoughby, which an interview now would
explain, &s;he was doubly &s;olicitous to prevent
it&mdash;Her pride could not bear that her brother
&s;hould become the humble and reduced coun|try
gentleman that he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be if he
married a woman without fortune; and her
avarice repre&s;ented the po&s;&s;ibility of his being,
in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a burthen on his affluent rela|tions.
<PB N="124" REF="126">
All the&s;e con&s;iderations determined
her to &s;tifle it, and the &s;entence with which
the letter concluded, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he might do
it with impunity. She therefore called up
Farnham, on who&s;e &s;implicity it was very ea&s;y
to impo&s;e, and told him that the letter to
Mr. Vava&s;our was very immaterial, and that
he might carry that; but that the other to
Mi&s;s de Mornay, was of a nature to involve
his ma&s;ter in great difficulties, and that there|fore
&s;he would de&s;troy it. She then put it
in the fire; and bide him carry the other,
which &s;he had carefully re-&s;ealed. This
Farnham immediately did; but being un|willing
to be guilty of a greater fal&s;ehood
than there &s;eemed to be occa&s;ion for, he ac|tually
went to Park-&s;treet that he might tell
his ma&s;ter he had been there.</P>
<P>On his return, Willoughby que&s;tioned him
who he &s;aw at Lady Horatia's.&mdash;For this
que&s;tion the poor fellow was not prepared.&mdash;However
he an&s;wered&mdash;"I &s;aw John, Sir,
my Lady's own footman."</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;and was Mi&s;s de Mornay at
home?"</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127">
"No, Sir," replied Farnham, who had
now acquired courage; "but you know you
bade me not wait for an an&s;wer."</P>
<P>"Well, but had you not the &s;en&s;e to a&s;k
where &s;he was?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir; to be &s;ure I did not think of
that: but, however, I fancy &s;he was vi&s;iting,
Sir, the wounded gentleman in Oxford-&s;treet."</P>
<P>Willoughby knew that Montague Thorold
lodged there, and that it mu&s;t be him alone
who was de&s;cribed as the wounded gentleman.</P>
<P>"And why do you think &s;o, Sir," &s;aid he,
fiercely, as if poor Farnham had been acce&s;|&s;ary
to it&mdash;"and what the devil have you
to do to think about it?"</P>
<P>"Lord, Sir," cried Farnham, "only be|cau&s;e
as I came along I &s;aw my lady's coach
at the door where I knew young Mr. Thorold
lodges, and ju&s;t nodded to Sam, who was
upon the box."</P>
<P>"Cur&s;ed fool!" exclaimed Willoughby&mdash;"could
you not have a&s;ked whether &s;he was
there or no: yet why &s;hould I de&s;ire to know;"
added he, ri&s;ing and walking about with his
hands clenched together&mdash;"what is it to me?
<PB N="126" REF="128">
and why do I torment my&s;elf?&mdash;Go, Sir, and
fetch my powdering gown and my things to
dre&s;s." Poor Farnham, convinced that Lady
Molyneux was right in what &s;he had done, yet
rendered doubly timid by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of having committed a &s;ort of fraud on his
ma&s;ter, ha&s;tily obeyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ituation of Cele&s;tina was rendered
infinitely more unea&s;y to her by the tran&s;ac|tions
of the la&s;t two or three days; and her
&s;pirits could no longer &s;upport her&mdash;The cer|tainty
of meeting Willoughby wherever &s;he
went, and of meeting him only to be more
and more convinced that he had cea&s;ed to
feel any degree of affection for her, made the
thoughts of continuing her pre&s;ent mode of
life, which had any charms in her opinion,
quite in&s;upportable to her. The conver&s;a|tion
about the duel&mdash;the que&s;tions &s;he &s;hould
be a&s;ked, and the impertinence &s;he mu&s;t at|tend
to, encrea&s;ed the aver&s;ion with which &s;he
thought of appearing again in public; and
&s;he determined, at any hazard, to propo&s;e to
Lady Horatia, that &s;he might go into the
<PB N="128" REF="130">
country, and there wait, wherever &s;he plea&s;ed,
till &s;he &s;hould her&s;elf quit London.</P>
<P>She took, therefore, the fir&s;t moment they
were alone together, to prefer and urge this
reque&s;t: and after making &s;ome objections,
which, however, the altered looks and de|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;pirits of Cele&s;tina very forcibly com|bated,
Lady Horatia con&s;ented to her going;
but as the hou&s;e of Je&s;&s;y was too near Al|ve&s;tone,
where it was &s;uppo&s;ed Willoughby and
his bride were immediately to go after their
marriage&mdash;it was &s;ettled that &s;he &s;hould, with a
maid to attend her, go to Cheltenham, and wait
there till Lady Horatia could leave London,
which &s;he propo&s;ed doing in a fortnight or
three weeks at farthe&s;t. This plan being
once arranged, Cele&s;tina was impatient till it
was executed; and &s;o effectually &s;et about the
little preparations &s;he had to make, that the
next day &s;he left London&mdash;and for the fir&s;t
time &s;ince her quitting the Hebrides, enjoyed
the calm &s;olitude &s;he loved.</P>
<P>Wretched in the mean time was the &s;tate of
Willoughby; he went to dine at Lord Ca&s;tle|norths,
as he had been obliged to promi&s;e&mdash;where
a large company were a&s;&s;embled, as if
<PB N="129" REF="131">
to receive him, for the fir&s;t time, as the heir
and acknowledged &s;on-in-law of Lord Ca&s;tle|north.
He had, however, no power to con|ceal,
under the common forms of life, the
mi&s;ery of his internal. feelings; his counte|nance
refu&s;ed to wear the forced &s;mile of
complai&s;ance; his emotion when the duel was
talked of, and the name of Cele&s;tina was in|troduced,
was evident enough to all but tho&s;e
who did not chu&s;e to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Lord Ca&s;tlenorth was, indeed, never very
much celebrated for di&s;cernment; but his
Lady, who highly piqued her&s;elf on her &s;a|gacity&mdash;on
the facility with which &s;he read
characters, and penetrated the views of tho&s;e
with whom &s;he conver&s;ed&mdash;her blindne&s;s there|fore
was evidently wilful&mdash;and that of her
daughter, unle&s;s her love or her vanity inter|cepted
her right, was equally &s;trange&mdash;cer|tain
it was, that they either could not, or
would not, attend to the reluctant melancholy
of Willoughby, under which he with difficulty
concealed the bitter agonies of de&s;pair; and
they appeared perfectly &s;atisfied with him and
with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There was one face, however, in the circle
<PB N="130" REF="132">
that, though it wore looks of fe&s;tivity, yet was
now and then &s;een to &s;urvey Willoughby with
indignant &s;corn; and then, as if checked for
indulging it, to re&s;ume the &s;mile of approba|tion
and complacency. Captain Cavanaugh
indeed did not very frequently addre&s;s him&s;elf
to him; but conver&s;ed chiefly with the
Ladies. But whenever he did &s;peak to him,
Willoughby him&s;elf, who had till now very
little noticed him, could not help remarking
that there was &s;omething peculiar in his man|ner.</P>
<P>When the Gentlemen were left together,
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, who could not drink, and
who&s;e health obliged him to retire early,
called to his nephew, and bade him take his
place. This Willoughby, who had been all
day meditating how he might make an early
e&s;cape, was compelled to do, though he ob|&s;erved,
"that as Captain Cavanaugh u&s;ually
took that &s;eat when his Lord&s;hip retired, he
wi&s;hed him then to a&s;&s;ume it." Lord Ca&s;tle|north,
however, per&s;i&s;ted; and Willoughby,
willing to get rid of an irk&s;ome ta&s;k as &s;oon
as po&s;&s;ible, made the wine circulate &s;o quick|ly,
that, as he was never in habits of drinking,
<PB N="131" REF="133">
he &s;oon began to find him&s;elf loo&s;ing his de|jection
in a kind of bewildering &s;tupor: any
thing &s;eemed better to him than the ta&s;k of
entertaining Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman for the re&s;t of
the evening; and as he felt he by degrees
cea&s;ed to think of her, he found &s;ome &s;atisfac|tion
in drinking, and was very &s;oon complete|ly
intoxicated.</P>
<P>He was no longer capable of judging for
him&s;elf, or he would not have gone up &s;tairs
in &s;uch a &s;ituation&mdash;he had ju&s;t recollection
enough left to &s;tay, without committing any
great extravagance, while tea was &s;erved; and
then gladly followed a &s;ervant who whi&s;pered
to him that Lord Ca&s;tlenorth de&s;ired the fa|vour
of &s;eeing him in his own apartment.</P>
<P>Thither he &s;taggered with very little con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s;
and being &s;eated where his uncle
&s;at oppo&s;ite to him, in a great chair, while
&s;everal parchments lay open on a table, he
heard, but without the lea&s;t comprehen&s;ion of
what was &s;aid, a long harangue&mdash;on for|tune
and family, heraldry and genealogy,
titles and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions;&mdash;the whole of which con|cluded,
by his informing him that the money
was ready to pay off all the incumbrances on
<PB N="132" REF="134">
his e&s;tate, which was to be immediately done;
that the &s;ettlements were in hand, and to be
fini&s;hed in a week; and that, that day fort|night
was fixed for the marriage. Willoughby,
between the verbo&s;e confu&s;ion of his uncle's
mode of delivery and his own incapacity of at|tention,
heard it all, but under&s;tood nothing;
he was not, however, &s;o uncon&s;cious of pain
and &s;ickne&s;s. Mrs. Calder, who for the
greater part of this conver&s;ation had &s;at read|ing
a treati&s;e on bilious concretions, on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room, with her &s;pectacles
on, now finding Lord Ca&s;tlenorth had done,
and that Willoughby looked very likely to
&s;ink out of his chair, very wi&s;ely ended this
conver&s;ation, by &s;ending up Farnham to his
ma&s;ter, who had him conveyed home in a
chair.</P>
<P>The next morning he was awakened to a
perfect recollection of all that had pa&s;&s;ed the
evening before; and became too certain, that
the means he had taken to obtain a temporary
relea&s;e from his fetters, had &s;erved only to
rivet them more clo&s;ely. Alas! he remem|bered
too&mdash;with poignant angui&s;h remem|bered,
that &s;o many hours had elap&s;ed &s;ince he
<PB N="133" REF="135">
had written to Cele&s;tina; and that it was now
too certain &s;he would not an&s;wer his letter,
and wholly declined &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>Though he had &s;o often determined never
to meet her again; &s;o often per&s;uaded him&s;elf
not wi&s;h it; this cruel conviction of her total
e&s;trangement from him, &s;eemed to fall as
heavily as if he had never dreamed of their
&s;eparation&mdash;&s;he might, however, be out of
town; &s;he might be engaged; &s;omething
might have prevented her writing. To this
&s;lender hope he clung for &s;ome hours of the
morning; but it in&s;en&s;ibly became fainter as
his impatience encrea&s;ed, and at length he
ordered Farnham to find the coachman of
Lady Horatia, with whom he was acquainted,
and try to di&s;cover any particulars he could.</P>
<P>Farnham, dreading le&s;t his ma&s;ter &s;hould
di&s;cover the impo&s;ition he had ventured to
practice, dared not di&s;obey him&mdash;he &s;at out
therefore for the &s;tables, where, at that time
in the morning, he was &s;ure of finding his ac|quaintance;
he found him indeed very bu&s;y
in cleaning, with the aid of a po&s;tillion and a
helper, two of his hor&s;es, which had been,
"poor things!" he &s;aid, "the fir&s;t &s;tage to Chel|tenham
<PB N="134" REF="136">
ham, with Mi&s;s de Mornay and Rebecca the
maid, that my Lady &s;ent with her."&mdash;Farn|ham
made him repeat this intelligence; to
which he added, "Why, my Lady and all of
us be going down to Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, in about
a fortnight; that is, as &s;oon as young Mr.
Thorold is well enough to be moved, which,
the Doctor as tends him &s;ays, will be in that
time or le&s;s. My Lady takes his illne&s;s &s;adly to
heart, and &s;o does Mi&s;s&mdash;and went out of
town &s;adly down in the mouth; but, how&s;o|ever,
'tis well 'twas no wor&s;e, you know;
and as he is like to do well&mdash;why there's no
great harm&mdash;and Mi&s;s will be married all
one."</P>
<P>The minute&s;t article, of this account was
remembered by Farnham, and punctually re|lated
by him to his ma&s;ter&mdash;who now tho|roughly
convinced that all hope was at an end
of Cele&s;tina's retaining for him any affection;
and a certainty &s;o dreadful; the a&s;&s;urance of
his being irrevocably engaged, and having
gone into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, there to wait the
recovery of Montague Thorold; the a&s;&s;ur|ance
that he &s;hould never &s;ee her more&mdash;all
contributed, with his exce&s;s of the evening be|fore,
<PB N="135" REF="137">
to inflame his blood&mdash;and by four o'clock
he was in an high fever.</P>
<P>His indi&s;po&s;ition was encrea&s;ed by a vi&s;it
from Vava&s;our, who laughed at the vexation
and di&s;gu&s;t he expre&s;&s;ed at what had hap|pened
in regard to Montague Thorold; but
grew graver when he heard that, far from its
having put an end to his preten&s;ions to Cele&s;|tina,
it had &s;erved only to ha&s;ten their mar|riage.&mdash;The
wild and ill founded projects of
Vava&s;our to prevent this, and to &s;ucceed him|&s;elf,
which to Willoughby would have been
equally hateful, were but little calculated to
appea&s;e his agitation, and quiet his boiling
blood; before Vava&s;our went away, he be|came
delirious&mdash;and Farnham, in a terrible
fright, went for Lady Molyneux and a phy|&s;ician&mdash;Lady
Molyneux was ju&s;t &s;tepping in|to
her coach, when the affrighted face of Farn|ham
appeared before her&mdash;&s;he chid him for
the needle&s;s alarm he had given her; and &s;aid,
that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it was nothing but a little
return of the fever her brother was &s;ubject
to&mdash;"I cannot," &s;aid &s;he, "call now; but as
I come home this evening, I will &s;ee him."&mdash;The
phy&s;ician, for whom Farnham then went,
<PB N="136" REF="138">
directly attended; and found his patient,
though not in &s;o high a fever as he had &s;een
him before, ill enough to require his immedi|ate
a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;which he ordered with &s;o happy
an effect, that in a few hours the delirium en|tirely
&s;ub&s;ided, and Willoughby, though ex|tremely
languid, was at night almo&s;t free
from his fever.&mdash;Lady Molyneux who called
on him, &s;oon after midnight, for a few mo|ments,
again blamed Farnham for his offici|ous
apprehen&s;ions; and being well convinced
that Willoughby would be glad of any excu&s;e
to keep back the preparations which were now
going on, &s;he endeavoured to per&s;uade him
that his illne&s;s was very tri&s;ling; and taking
occa&s;ion to talk over what happened at Rane|lagh,
told her brother, laughingly,&mdash;that &s;he
hoped he was now convinced of the attach|ment
between young Thorold and Mi&s;s de
Mornay&mdash;adding, "his brother, Captain Tho|rold,
who is really an elegant and fa&s;hionable
man, tells me they are to be married the mo|ment
Montague is able to leave London."</P>
<P>"Well, well," cried Willoughby, peevi&s;h|ly&mdash;"I
know it; and I do not de&s;ire to hear
any more about it.&mdash;I thank you for calling
<PB N="137" REF="139">
on me; but it is very late, and my phy&s;ician
de&s;ires I will keep my&s;elf quiet."</P>
<P>Lady Molyneux then withdrew, and poor
Willoughby, to whom &s;he had admini&s;tered a
poi&s;on in&s;tead of a cordial, tried to find that
repo&s;e which he &s;o greatly wanted: but to
him his e&s;tranged, his lo&s;t Cele&s;tina, on one
hand, and on the other his intended bride,
&s;eemed to cry&mdash;"&s;leep no more."</P>
<P>Farnham, who &s;at up by him to admini&s;ter
the medicines he was to take, heard him &s;igh
the greate&s;t part of the night without cea&s;ing;
and whenever he thought he might venture,
a&s;ked him how he did.&mdash;"Pr'ythee, Farnham,"
&s;aid he, after two or three of the&s;e que&s;tions,
"do not a&s;k me how I do&mdash;how &s;hould a man
do, who is in a &s;ituation to envy every body
but the fellow ju&s;t going to be hanged&mdash;you
know, that I am at this moment the mo&s;t
mi&s;erable fellow upon earth."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure I am very &s;orry to hear it
an&s;wered his &s;ervant: but if I might be &s;o
bold as to &s;peak, I &s;hould &s;ay that I cannot
think what cau&s;e you can have to be mi&s;er|able&mdash;nor....."</P>
<P>He was going on, when Willoughby, eager|ly
<PB N="138" REF="140">
catching a&s;ide the curtain, &s;aid, "What cau&s;e!&mdash;Have
I not lo&s;t an angel&mdash;and am I not, have
I not condemned my&s;elf to marry&mdash;a woman
I cannot love&mdash;no, never; never, by Heaven."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure, Sir," &s;aid Farnham, "to be
cro&s;&s;ed in love, as I may &s;ay, is very bad&mdash;as
I have heard tell&mdash;but in this here matter&mdash;all
things con&s;idered, I hope your honour's
mind will be &s;ettled about it; and as for the
two ladies, to be &s;ure beauty is all fancy&mdash;Mi&s;s
Cele&s;tina, for certain, is a fine young
lady, and &s;o good and gentle to &s;ervants,
that it was always a plea&s;ure to me to hear her
&s;peak to me, and to wait upon her; but then,
for certain, Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, though &s;he is
higher and more &s;tately, as &s;he ought to be,
being as &s;he is a lady of title and quality&mdash;is
a fine young lady too, and a very maje&s;tic
grand per&s;on&mdash;and then her great riches&mdash;"Cur&s;e
on her riches," exclaimed Willoughby.
 "Aye, Sir;" &s;aid Farnham, who was not a
little &s;lattered by his confidence, and was now
got into one of his pro&s;ing humours&mdash;"Aye
Sir, it is very well for young, gentlemen to
cry cur&s;e on this, and that, and t'other&mdash;but
as for riches&mdash;what can they do without them?
<PB N="139" REF="141">
Nobody is not re&s;pected the lea&s;t in the world,
if they don't make a &s;hew, and a figure, and
the like of that&mdash;and can it be done without
money?&mdash;No&mdash;nor not without a pretty deal
on't&mdash;and, for my part, I own&mdash;I don't love
to &s;ee <HI>my</HI> ma&s;ter not able to vie with the be&s;t
lord of the land&mdash;as to be &s;ure he ought."</P>
<P>"Thou art a fool, Farnham," cried Wil|loughby&mdash;"Do
have done with thy Lords of
the land, and give me twenty drops more of
the opiate"&mdash;"Yes, Sir," &s;aid Farnham; and
prepared to obey him&mdash;but while he was
counting out the drops, he could not forbear
going on&mdash;"One, two&mdash;there are other peo|ple,
Sir,&mdash;three, four&mdash;about my Lord's
hou&s;e, who, it's my notion&mdash;five, &s;ix, &s;even&mdash;are
not &s;o apt to cry, cur&s;e money&mdash;eight,
nine, ten&mdash;there is Captain Cavanaugh&mdash;eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen"&mdash;"Cap|tain
Cavanaugh," interrupts Willoughby&mdash;"What
of Captain Cavanaugh?" "Nay, Sir,&mdash;only
the Captain&mdash;as far as I can find&mdash;do'nt
hate money, nor cry, cur&s;e it and damn
it&mdash;he has been long enough living about the
world, to know that nothing can be had with|out
it, and&mdash;that is all, Sir."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="142">
"But that &s;eems to me not to be all, Sir&mdash;pray,
tell me what Captain Cavanaugh has to
do with what we were talking of&mdash;with Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman?"</P>
<P>"Lord, nothing, Sir, I am &s;ure, that I know
of&mdash;only, if the young Lady was not engaged,
and in love with you, perhaps&mdash;the Cap|tain,
Sir, is reckoned, by the women, a very
hand&s;ome man, Sir&mdash;and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
may think &s;o, as well as another." "Why
he is married&mdash;you booby&mdash;what &s;tuff have
you got into your head; and who has been
talking to you of him and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman;
let him be reckoned as hand&s;ome as he will
by the women&mdash;he can be nothing to Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman&mdash;for I know he has been mar|ried
&s;ome years."</P>
<P>"Aye, Sir, I dare &s;ay that may be&mdash;but
there is &s;uch a thing as being un-married
again;&mdash;not that I ever heard, I am &s;ure, much
about the Captain; only Ju&s;tina was laughing
one day, and laying, in her broken Engli&s;h&mdash;&s;o
that I can't &s;ay I quite right under&s;tand
her&mdash;that if my Lord &s;hould die, and the Cap|tain
&s;hould ever be able to get rid of his wife&mdash;&s;he
&s;hould not be much &s;urpri&s;ed if he and
<PB N="141" REF="143">
my Lady was to make a match of it; for that
never was &s;uch a favourite as the Captain."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould not be much &s;urpri&s;ed at that
my&s;elf," an&s;wered Willoughby, "for I believe
the Captain <HI>has</HI> a good deal of intere&s;t there&mdash;&s;o,
then, he has been trying to get rid of his
wife?"</P>
<P>"Ju&s;tina told me, Sir, one day, as a great
&s;ecret, that my Lord had helped him to money,
to try at it.&mdash;But, Sir, if Ju&s;tina &s;hould know
I ever mentioned it, I &s;hould never be able to
get a word out of her again." "I promi&s;e
thee, &s;he never &s;hall&mdash;&s;o tell me, Farnham, all
thou ha&s;t heard from her about Lady Ca&s;tle|north
and the Captain."</P>
<P>"Why, Sir, it was not much&mdash;but only
Ju&s;tina was laughing t'other day about my
Lady's having &s;uch a great friend&s;hip for him,
and there's no &s;topping her tongue when &s;he
begins&mdash;&s;o &s;he told me&mdash;Lord, Sir! a great
many things that were odd enough to be &s;ure&mdash;but
only Ladies of quality, I reckon, don't
much care what people &s;ays of them.&mdash;She
&s;aid, that my Lady knew well enough, that
my Lord could not hold it long&mdash;and that
&s;he was providing her&s;elf with a hand&s;ome
<PB N="142" REF="144">
young hu&s;band, and making &s;ure of him, as
&s;he thought, before the old one hobbled off&mdash;but
let her take care, &s;aid Ju&s;tina, that &s;he
marries her daughter fir&s;t, or I know what
will happen.&mdash;The Captain knows well
enough, that a young woman is better than
an old one; and be&s;ides, that &s;uch a great for|tune
as my young lady will have, is better,
twenty to one, than her mother's jointure."</P>
<P>This &s;peech at once opened Willoughby's
eyes, as to Lady Ca&s;tlenorth's motives for the
extreme ha&s;te and earne&s;tne&s;s &s;he had &s;hewn
to conclude her daughter's marriage; feeling
as he did, in regard to Mi&s;s Hayman, he was
&s;en&s;ible neither of jealou&s;y or mortification,
at the idea of any preference &s;he might enter|tain
for Cavanaugh; but a hope, that, from this
circum&s;tance, &s;omething might happen to
break off the connection for ever between him
and his cou&s;in involuntarily aro&s;e in his mind.&mdash;In
any event, it ought to be attended to; he
bade Farnham therefore go the next day,
and &s;ee if he could &s;et Ju&s;tina go&s;&s;ipping
again&mdash;"I have a notion, Farnham," &s;aid he
"that you are very much in the good graces
of the little Neapolitan."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">
"Oh, no, Sir; finer fellows than I am have
all the chance there&mdash;and for my part, Sir, I
don't much fancy her, though &s;he is lively
and &s;mart, and when I get her by her&s;elf will
tell the &s;ecrets of all the family."</P>
<P>"Which thou love&s;t to hear; therefore get
her by her&s;elf as &s;oon as thou can&s;t, and make
her tell thee all &s;he knows."</P>
<P>Willoughby then again tried to compo&s;e
him&s;elf&mdash;and by the help of the medicines he
had taken, obtained four or five hours &s;leep.&mdash;He
was a great deal better in the morning;
as he breakfa&s;ted, a note was brought him
from Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, informing him that
his uncle had been &s;eized in the night with a
violent return of that a&s;thmatic complaint
which &s;o frequently had rendered his &s;tay in
England impo&s;&s;ible: that the &s;pring, though
far advanced, was &s;o cold and wet, that there
was no chance of his being better while he
remained there now; and that therefore he had,
by the advice of his phy&s;icians, and by his own
inclination, determined to &s;et out that very
day for the continent. She added, "You
will come to us, of cour&s;e, in&s;tantly, and if you
cannot go with us, &s;ettle when you will follow
<PB N="144" REF="146">
us; but your uncle wi&s;hes you to accom|pany
us."</P>
<P>This intelligence was to Willoughby like
a reprieve from what to him was wor&s;e than
death; &s;ince the longer he con&s;idered of his
marriage, the more di&s;honourable now, and
the more certainly mi&s;erable hereafter, it ap|peared
to him. He wrote an ha&s;ty note,
&s;aying how ill he had been the whole night,
and how impo&s;&s;ible he feared it would be for
him to &s;ee his uncle that day; but that, if his
phy&s;ician, whom he every moment expected,
gave him leave to go out, he would certainly
wait upon him.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer had not been di&s;patched above
an hour, and his medical friend had ju&s;t left
him, with a &s;trict injunction not to &s;tir out
that day, when Lady Ca&s;tlenorth and Mrs.
Calder entered his room.</P>
<P>"So, my dear Sir," cried the former&mdash;"what
is to be done! Lord Ca&s;tlenorth will
be wretched to leave you behind&mdash;and my
poor girl too!&mdash;What is this &s;udden fever&mdash;you
really look ill&mdash;I cannot imagine what is
to be done&mdash;For my Lord to &s;tay, he thinks
it death."</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
Willoughby muttered &s;omething which he
meant &s;hould expre&s;s concern at his uncle's
illne&s;s: but Mrs. Calder fortunately precluded
the nece&s;&s;ity of his being very di&s;tinct in his
hypocri&s;y, by &s;tepping up to him, and taking
his hand, "Come, come," &s;aid &s;he, "let me
feel your pul&s;e." She then, gravely counting
its vibrations as &s;he held her &s;top-watch, &s;aid,
"Why, really now, here is much le&s;s fever
than I expected from your appearance&mdash;let us
&s;ee your tongue.&mdash;Humph&mdash;'tis white to be
&s;ure&mdash;Where are your medicines&mdash;I &s;hould
think, if you were well wrapped up and put
into a chair, you might go to your uncle with|out
any danger&mdash;on &s;uch an emergency, you
know, a little may be hazarded."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, "by no
means; nothing mu&s;t be hazarded&mdash;And af|ter
all, my Lord may make him&s;elf ea&s;y, as I
dare &s;ay you will be able to overtake us be|fore
we get to Paris; where, if my Lord is
better, and finds that relief he generally does
from a change of air, we will &s;top till you
join us: I think you will be perfectly re&s;tored
in a week: but, however, I will go my&s;elf to
Dr. B&mdash;, and hear what he &s;ays."</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148">
"Oh, I can tell you," interrupted Mrs.
Calder, "that he'll be well, perfectly well, in
le&s;s than a week.&mdash;I have been ta&s;ting his
medicines, and under&s;tand clearly from them
what Dr. B&mdash;thinks of his fever&mdash;I was
a mere ephemeris&mdash;of that be a&s;&s;ured.&hellip;"</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, "my dear
Willoughby, what &s;hall we &s;ay?"</P>
<P>Willoughby was ready to an&s;wer&mdash;"No|thing
more, good Madam:" but &s;ighing from
a &s;en&s;e of pain and re&s;traint, he only replied,
"that he could only &s;ay that he was very
&s;orry for his uncle's illne&s;s&mdash;and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"That you will ha&s;ten after us?&mdash;that, I
think, I may venture to a&s;&s;ure your uncle.&mdash;He
was &s;ettling this morning that you &s;hould
be married in the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador's chapel
at Paris; and I really don't &s;ee my&s;elf that,
upon the whole, the&s;e unlucky illne&s;&s;es of my
Lord's and of your's need impede the affair a
&s;ingle hour; all the difference will be, that
you will be married at Paris, in&s;tead of at Lon|don,
and we will pa&s;s the re&s;t of the year in
Italy in&s;tead of Ca&s;tlenorth."</P>
<P>"But the dear young Lady," cried Mrs.
<PB N="147" REF="149">
Calder, "our &s;weet and lovely child, how
will &s;he bear even this tran&s;ient &s;eparation!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, I don't know," &s;aid Lady Ca&s;tle|north,
affecting to be quite &s;ympathetic&mdash;"but
&s;he &s;hall come, and bring the letter
my Lord will have directed to be written with
his la&s;t directions about the deeds and car|riages;
which our dear George mu&s;t bring
with him: and" added &s;he, &s;miling, "I fancy,
upon the footing they are now, there will be
no great indecorum in her coming to his
lodgings."</P>
<P>Willoughby found immediately his fever
returning, and that he &s;hould have a terrible
headach: he put up his hand to his temples&mdash;"I am obliged to your Lady&s;hip," &s;aid he
in a languid voice; "and I wi&s;h this mo&s;t
oppre&s;&s;ive head-ach of mine would&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What it aches now, does it?" &s;aid Mrs.
Calder, "I wi&s;h Dr. B&mdash;was here, I am
&s;ure I could give him a hint or two on this
ca&s;e which might be of u&s;e to him."</P>
<P>"Let us go to him," interrupted Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth, "and talk to him about this
ugly fever; and when we have found him, it
will be time to return to my Lord, and to &s;end
<PB N="148" REF="150">
my daughter hither; for we think to &s;leep at
Roche&s;ter to-night."</P>
<P>Willoughby now ble&s;&s;ing her for her ha&s;te,
made his compliments in a low voice; and &s;till
complaining of his head&mdash;the Ladies de|parted.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner gone, than he tried to
di&s;cover by what means he might be&s;t avoid
receiving the favour of the vi&s;it Lady Ca&s;tle|north
had promi&s;ed him from her daughter.
He was a&s;hamed of the part he was acting,
however ill and reluctantly he performed it.
For the fir&s;t time in his life his conduct was
contrary to his &s;en&s;e of honour, and, he was
con&s;cious, altogether unworthy of him; and
while he had thus betrayed him&s;elf, he was
become the dupe of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, and
perhaps was meant to be the dupe of Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman and their mutual favourite.&mdash;His
pride, as well as his rectitude, revolted
from the idea of carrying on this odious farce,
which he now wondered what demon had
tempted him, in the moment of pa&s;&s;ion and
de&s;pair, to begin&mdash;and which he, however
late, thought he &s;hould now act more ho|nourably
in ending at once, than in &s;uffering it
<PB N="149" REF="151">
it to proceed another day&mdash;He was, however,
by no means able to determine, at once, how
he &s;hould do this; and what he had mo&s;t im|mediately
to con&s;ider was, how he &s;hould
e&s;cape the enquiry and adieu of the heire&s;s,
which he might now every moment expect.</P>
<P>He at length determined to go to bed&mdash;and
&s;ending again for his phy&s;ician, who was
very much his friend, acknowledged the truth
to him, and got an ab&s;olute prohibition again&s;t
his &s;eeing any body&mdash;He told Farnham,
therefore, that he again felt him&s;elf extreme|ly
ill; and bade him immediately run for Dr.
B&mdash;. Fortunately he met him in the next
&s;treet; and in le&s;s than ten minutes he had
received Willoughby's confe&s;&s;ion, that all his
illne&s;s, both before and &s;ince his return from
abroad, had been owing to di&s;tre&s;s of mind,
which he could now no longer hope would
abate, by the nece&s;&s;ity he had thought of
putting him&s;elf under to conceal it&mdash;In &s;hort,
he owned that his di&s;like to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
as a wife, was unconquerable; and that
as he was determined at all events to break
the treaty off, however far it had gone, and
therefore entreated his friend to find &s;ome rea|&s;on
<PB N="150" REF="152">
for his evading an interview &s;o u&s;ele&s;s and
&s;o irk&s;ome, when it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to
continue acting a moment longer the part he
had &s;o ra&s;hly undertaken; and yet did not
mean, and e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent condition
of his uncle's health, abruptly and rudely to
end it; but to &s;often, at lea&s;t to him, a di&s;|appointment
which he had thus rendered
doubly heavy.</P>
<P>Dr. B&mdash;entered at once into his meaning,&mdash;and,
&s;miling, &s;aid, "It is a little unu&s;ual,
my friend, for me to contrive an illne&s;s to
&s;eparate a lady from her lover, though I have
been often a&s;ked to make pretences for bring|ing
them together.&mdash;However, the fact is,
that you really are unfit to entertain the lady,
for your fever is con&s;iderably increa&s;ed &s;ince I
&s;aw you in the morning; and we &s;ee very
plainly that any agitation is hazardous while
you continue in this irritable &s;tate:&mdash;I will
therefore wait here and &s;ee Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
my&s;elf; and &s;o contrive as to bring you off
this time, and for the future you mu&s;t ma|nage
it your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure you de&s;pi&s;e me, Doctor,"&mdash;cried
Willoughby, "for the part I have acted
in this cur&s;ed affair."</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153">
"No," an&s;wered he, "not exactly &s;o&mdash;But
I own I think you wrong, ina&s;much as any
kind of di&s;&s;imulation is unworthy of you; and
above all, that which goes to rob a young
woman of her heart under fal&s;e pretences."</P>
<P>"But I hope I have not done that&mdash;for,
upon my honour, I &s;hould never forgive my|&s;elf,
if I had."</P>
<P>It looks very like it though, my friend,
from your own account of the matter&mdash;And
if it is &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>"You think I ought, at all events, to
marry her?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I do."</P>
<P>"Alas, my dear Sir," &s;aid Willoughby,
"it is &s;urely better for me&mdash;even more ho|nourable,
to decline her hand now, than to
accept it and make her mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>"I don't believe you could make any wo|man
mi&s;erable," an&s;wered Dr. B&mdash;, "be|cau&s;e
you have good nature, honour, and ge|nero&s;ity&mdash;but,
my dear Sir, I did not mean to
play the ca&s;ui&s;t in &s;uch an affair&mdash;and here&mdash;if
I am not mi&s;taken, is the lady her&s;elf at
the door."</P>
<P>"Dear Doctor," cried Willoughby, "have
<PB N="152" REF="154">
the goodne&s;s to go down directly." He im|mediately
obeyed&mdash;and returning in a few
moments, &s;aid, "Well, I have &s;ent away the
di&s;con&s;olate fair one&mdash;broken-hearted&mdash;for
fear of lo&s;ing her love."</P>
<P>"Don't rally me, my friend,"&mdash;an&s;wered
Willoughby&mdash;"But, tell me, did my cou&s;in
appear very much concerned?"</P>
<P>"She endeavoured at lea&s;t to appear &s;o."</P>
<P>"Do you think then it was merely en|deavour?"</P>
<P>"Would you not be mortified, now, if I
&s;aid it &s;eemed &s;o to me?"</P>
<P>"No, upon my honour&mdash;I might perhaps
be mortified to find that I was believed to be
an ea&s;y &s;ubject of impo&s;ition&mdash;but for the re&s;t&mdash;nothing
would be a greater relief to me, than to
be well a&s;&s;ured that the partiality my cou&s;in
&s;hewed for me was either never real, or, having
been &s;o, exi&s;ts no longer."</P>
<P>"I don't know her enough," replied Dr.
B&mdash;, "nor have I been long enough talk|ing
to her now to be a very good judge.&mdash;The
hone&s;te&s;t of them, my friend, are not
ea&s;ily under&s;tood&mdash;and I am much mi&s;taken
if your fair relation comes under that de&s;crip|tion.&mdash;
<PB N="153" REF="155">
I mean, when I &s;ay hone&s;te&s;t&mdash;the mo&s;t
candid&mdash;the mo&s;t &s;incere."</P>
<P>"Well! but what do you judge, from her
behaviour ju&s;t now, are Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman's
&s;entiments towards me?"</P>
<P>"She would have me believe, I think,
that they are tho&s;e of great attachment and
trembling apprehen&s;ion for your health&mdash;But,
&s;omehow, it was, I fancied, a &s;ort of concern
that had more &s;tage effect for its object, than
real concern ever thinks about&mdash;and I do be|lieve,
that if you <HI>do</HI> prove a perjured &s;wain
after all, the heire&s;s of Ca&s;tlenorth will not
add to the &s;orrowful catalogue of dam&s;els who
have died for love."</P>
<P>Willoughby, glad to hear this, now rea|dily
promi&s;ed a ready acquie&s;cence with his
friend's orders, which were to keep his mind
as quiet as he could, and to &s;ee nobody till
he had quite conquered his remaining indi&s;po|&s;ition;
and the Doctor then took his leave.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than two hours, a large pacquet came
to him from Lord Ca&s;tlenorth&mdash;which Wil|loughby
&s;ent word down to the man who
brought it, that he was then too ill to open&mdash;On
Farnham's delivering this me&s;&s;age, the
<PB N="154" REF="156">
&s;ervant &s;aid, that no an&s;wer then was requir|ed,
for that his lord and lady, their daugh|ter,
Mrs. Calder, and Captain Cavanaugh,
had all departed, with the &s;ervants who were
immediately about them, the very moment he
came away, and were then, in two po&s;t coaches
and four, on their way to Roche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Willoughby felt for a moment as much re|lieved
by this intelligence, as if half his trou|bles
had been removed by their departure.&mdash;Too
&s;oon, however, this temporary re&s;pite
ended, by his recollecting how much he mu&s;t
yet encounter before he could feel him&s;elf
free; and that whatever freedom he might
regain, Cele&s;tina would be another's.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="155" REF="157">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time Cele&s;tina was alone at
Cheltenham, indulging that regret which
aro&s;e from the certain lo&s;s of Willoughby's
friend&s;hip, and the a&s;&s;urance that &s;he &s;hould
&s;ee him no more.&mdash;Every day &s;he expected to
&s;ee in the new&s;papers, or to hear from Lady
Horatia, that he was married&mdash;and though
&s;he tried to rea&s;on her&s;elf into a calm acqui|e&s;cence
with what was unavoidable, &s;he never
opened a paper or a letter without trembling.</P>
<P>But her own unhappine&s;s prevented her not
from feeling for the unhappine&s;s of her friends.
The letter &s;he had received from Emily Cath|cart
had made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon her&mdash;though
&s;he knew not how it would be proper
to act to an&s;wer the views of the writer.&mdash;At
<PB N="156" REF="158">
length &s;he determined to write to Mrs. El|phin&s;tone,
and enclo&s;e the letter it&s;elf&mdash;and
this &s;he did a few days after &s;he was &s;ettled at
Cheltenham.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every po&s;t brought her accounts of
the amendment of Montague Thorold, from
Lady Horatia, who vi&s;ited him con&s;tantly&mdash;and
in almo&s;t every letter &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, either
plainly or by implication, her expectations
that Cele&s;tina would attend to the wi&s;hes of
all her friends, and give him her hand imme|diately
on his recovery.&mdash;This repeated im|portunity
from a per&s;on to who&s;e wi&s;hes,
and for who&s;e opinion &s;he felt &s;o much de|ference
to be due, was infinitely painful to
her; but how to e&s;cape from it &s;he knew
not.&mdash;If &s;he quitted Lady Horatia &s;he had
no proper protection&mdash;no home to receive
her&mdash;and though her little income had hi|therto
more than &s;ufficed to &s;upport her
while with &s;uch a friend, and though &s;he had
received about an hundred pounds from
Cathcart, paid her by the direction of Wil|loughby
while he was abroad, which yet re|mained
almo&s;t untouched, yet on &s;uch a &s;um,
and on the intere&s;t of fifteen hundred pounds,
<PB N="157" REF="159">
&s;he could not with any degree of prudence
adopt the plan on which her imagination had
lately dwelt with peculiar plea&s;ure&mdash;that of
&s;etting out alone, or with only a female &s;er|vant,
and travelling through France. She
fancied that there &s;he might be enabled,
though &s;he had yet no clue to guide her, to
find &s;ome traces of her family.&mdash;An invincible
inclination, which &s;he &s;ometimes took for the
in&s;piration of heaven, had been for &s;ome weeks
gaining on her imagination&mdash;and every thing
&s;eemed to encourage it; but rea&s;on and pru|dence,
both of which were perhaps decidedly
in favour of her accepting the proper e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
offered her, by a man who had
not only given &s;o many proofs of his &s;incere
and tender affection for her, but who was
the &s;on of one of her be&s;t friends, and avow|edly
recommended to her by another&mdash;a man
too whom &s;he preferred to every other per&s;on
except Willoughby, and whom &s;he would
have cho&s;en had Willoughby never been in
que&s;tion.</P>
<P>For her it was very certain that he was in
que&s;tion no longer; he was in fact dead to
her&mdash;and no probability remained of his ever
<PB N="158" REF="160">
feeling for her even the regret that the lo&s;s of
an agreeable acquaintance might have given
him.&mdash;But &s;till her heart and her imagina|tion
had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider
him as their fir&s;t object, that &s;he found it im|po&s;&s;ible
for her to transfer to another the
&s;ame attachment; and without being &s;en&s;ible
of love &s;he could not promi&s;e it&mdash;&s;he de&s;ired
nothing but to be permitted to live &s;ingle;
and be mi&s;tre&s;s of her time and her&s;elf&mdash;and
not to be importuned to undertake duties
which her heart told her &s;he could not con|&s;cientiou&s;ly
fulfil.</P>
<P>But &s;he fore&s;aw too evidently, that while
&s;he remained in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and
Lady Horatia continued &s;o eager for the
match, her life mu&s;t pa&s;s in a continual con|flict
between her wi&s;h to gratify her friend,
and her di&s;inclination to marriage. At her
time of life, profe&s;&s;ions of a re&s;olution to re|main
&s;ingle were merely laughed at, and
never believed; and Montague Thorold had
never hitherto con&s;idered her gentle refu&s;als
and friendly admonitions to de&s;i&s;t, but as be|ing
in reality as much encouragement as &s;he
could give him, while her &s;ituation in regard
<PB N="159" REF="161">
to Willoughby remained &s;oaukwardly undecid|ed&mdash;that
while he might renounce the name
of lover, he might &s;till a&s;&s;ume that of a near re|lation,
and have the power of controuling, or
at lea&s;t of directing her.</P>
<P>Now that it was decided, beyond a doubt,
that he neither meant to avail him&s;elf of either
the one or the other, &s;he &s;aw that &s;he had no|thing
to urge in &s;upport of her refu&s;al which
would be li&s;tened to; and while her mind
dwelt on all the friendly but &s;till irk&s;ome
controver&s;y in which &s;he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be
engaged when Lady Horatia and Thorold
came down, it of cour&s;e adverted to the means
of relief, which could, &s;he thought, be obtain|ed
only by her quitting England&mdash;and for
her doing &s;o, her natural de&s;ire to di&s;cover
her parents was, &s;he thought, a &s;ufficient ex|cu&s;e.</P>
<P>In her pre&s;ent &s;olitude &s;he found &s;o much to
&s;oothe and con&s;ole her, that &s;he longed for no|thing
&s;o much as the power of enjoying it, and
at the &s;ame time wandering through various
countries, and particularly through that which
&s;he had been taught to con&s;ider as her own. The
longer &s;he thought of this plan, the more agree|able
<PB N="160" REF="162">
it became to her imagination; and &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed many hours every day in reading travels
through France, Italy, and Switzerland, &s;till
humouring this vi&s;ionary idea till it had ac|quired
the force of a <HI>pre&s;entiment;</HI> a per&s;ua|&s;ion
that could &s;he go to the South of France
&s;he &s;hould find her family.</P>
<P>Of this &s;he continually thought: of this &s;he
continually dreamed; and though one great
motive that would haveurged her to attempt it,
the po&s;&s;ibility of being re&s;tored to Willoughby,
was at an end, &s;he &s;till determined to execute
this plan before the &s;ummer elap&s;ed.</P>
<P>She had indeed nothing but her gratitude
and attachment to Lady Horatia to detain
her in England&mdash;&s;he could not go to Je&s;&s;y,
becau&s;e it was &s;o near Alve&s;tone; nor enjoy
the friendly and in&s;tructive conver&s;ation of
Mr. Thorold, becau&s;e of the unfortunate par|tiality
of his &s;on.&mdash;The &s;ole remaining friend
of her childhood, Lady Molyneux, was not
merely e&s;tranged from her, but had invariably
treated her with negligence, &s;corn, and con|tempt.&mdash;To
England therefore &s;he had at lea&s;t
no friends who attached her&mdash;the whole world
was her country; and with that re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="161" REF="163">
to which the unhappy are &s;ubject, &s;he fancied
that in any part of it &s;he &s;hould find more
&s;atisfaction than in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>By her wandering continually alone in the
plea&s;ant country that &s;urrounded the town
where &s;he re&s;ided, at a &s;ea&s;on too when the
face of nature was every day growing more
lovely, her talent for poetry, which &s;ometimes
remained for whole months unexerci&s;ed, was
again called forth; but whatever were the ob|jects
really before her, whatever were pre&s;ent|ed
to her mind by books, Willoughby was
ever the principal figure in the land&s;cape.&mdash;If
&s;he &s;at on the green hill, as &s;he often did for
hours together, lo&s;t in mournful yet not un|plea&s;ing
reverie, it was only to recollect &s;cenes
that were pa&s;&s;ed; which the &s;ame &s;ounds &s;he
had then heard, the &s;imple &s;heep-bell, the
early &s;ong of birds; the &s;ame &s;cents of fre&s;h
turf and wild flowers, brought again mo&s;t
forcibly to her recollection.</P>
<P>If in her reading, &s;he was by the traveller's
lively de&s;cription of the countries he had
pa&s;&s;ed through, to fancy her&s;elf there, &s;he re|verted
in&s;tantly to the delight &s;he &s;hould have
<PB N="162" REF="164">
felt could &s;he in a progre&s;s through &s;uch ro|mantic
&s;cenes have been the companion of
Willoughby; and it was in this di&s;po&s;ition of
mind, that after peru&s;ing an account of a
cottage and its inhabitants overwhelmed by
the fall of an avalanche, a great body of &s;now
from the mountain above, &s;he compo&s;ed the
following little lyric poem.</P>
<Q><LG>

<P>While Cele&s;tina was thus, with more tender|ne&s;s
than di&s;cretion, cheri&s;hing the memory
of the friend &s;he had lo&s;t, Willoughby was
very differently occupied from what her ima|gination
&s;ugge&s;ted.&mdash;In&s;tead of being the gay
and fortunate lover, on the eve of marrying
one of the greate&s;t heire&s;&s;es in England, he
was &s;uffering in his per&s;onal health, from the
anxiety of a mind at war with it&s;elf&mdash;and cer|tain
of nothing but that for him the world no
longer contained any happine&s;s.&mdash;The intel|ligence,
however vague, and like the com|mon
go&s;&s;ipping &s;tories &s;o u&s;ual among &s;ervants,
that he had received from Farnham, had made
<PB N="165" REF="167">
a great impre&s;&s;ion, which what he afterwards
gathered from the &s;ame quarter had increa&s;ed.
Ju&s;tina had told Farnham, as a &s;ecret however
of the fir&s;t importance, that Captain Cava|naugh
had been of late in the habit of being
admitted to her young lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room
after Lady Ca&s;tlenorth and the family were
retired, however late the hour might be&mdash;that
her young lady was obliged to entru&s;t
her with the&s;e vi&s;its, that they might be more
&s;ecurely concealed from the re&s;t of the family;
but that &s;ometimes &s;he had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to
bed, and &s;ometimes ordered to wait till he re|tired.&mdash;That
on &s;ome of tho&s;e occa&s;ions &s;he
ob&s;erved her young lady had been crying, by
the redne&s;s of her eyes; and that then the
Captain had always left her with the air of a
man much offended.&mdash;That &s;he had &s;ome|times
heard them talk in voices as if they
were arguing upon &s;omething, but could ne|ver
di&s;tinctly under&s;tand what their conver&s;a|tion
was about.&mdash;"They were in &s;ad fright
always," &s;aid Ju&s;tina, "that Miladi hear
them.&mdash;Miladi knows not at all what goes on
in this hou&s;e."&mdash;"And my lady, I &s;uppo&s;e,"
<PB N="166" REF="168">
&s;aid Farnham, "would be in a horrible pa&s;|&s;ion
if &s;he heard of it?" "Oh, for me," re|plied
&s;he, "I could not &s;tay if &s;he did find
it out."&mdash;"But why," enquired Farnham,
"why, if your young lady likes the Captain
&s;o as to have him keep company with her in
this manner, what does &s;he mean by marry|ing
my ma&s;ter?" Ju&s;tina then, with an arch
look, an&s;wered, "Oh, my good friend, the
Captain has one wife already; and why &s;hould
not my young lady have one hu&s;band?&mdash;The
Captain will be her Ceci&s;beo&mdash;cavalier
&s;ervante."&mdash;"I don't under&s;tand your French
out-of-the-way names," replied Farnham;
"but I am &s;ure, that if your lady marries
my ma&s;ter only to play &s;uch pranks as &s;ome
other fine ladies do, &s;he will get into a bad
&s;crape&mdash;for he is not a man to be quiet when
&s;uch fort of doings are a-going on, that I can
tell her&mdash;and if &s;he don't love him better than
any other man, I think &s;he had much better
&s;ay &s;o."&mdash;"Oh, &s;illy man,"&mdash;an&s;wered Ju&s;|tina&mdash;"as
if my young lady could not have
a regard for both of them!"&mdash;"Aye, aye,"
replied Farnham, "that may do well enough
in your country&mdash;but it will never do here."&mdash;
<PB N="167" REF="169">
Ju&s;tina now, afraid that Farnham's zeal for
his ma&s;ter would perhaps urge him to reveal
the dangerous &s;ecret with which &s;he had thus
entru&s;ted him, began to &s;often the har&s;he&s;t
features of it; by &s;aying, that &s;he believed
there was no harm at all in the friend&s;hip be|tween
her young lady and Captain Cava|naugh&mdash;that
to be &s;ure, the Captain was a
&s;weet hand&s;ome man, and very agreeable&mdash;and
therefore her young lady liked to talk with
him, which &s;he never could do when her mo|ther
was by; as &s;he never &s;uffered him to
&s;peak hardly to any body el&s;e&mdash;and that it
was natural enough for her lady to like the
Captain, and have a regard for him, becau&s;e
&s;he had known him &s;o long.&mdash;She ended her
conver&s;ation with exacting from Farnham a
promi&s;e that he would never mention a &s;yl|lable
to any body of what &s;he had told him;
a promi&s;e which he kept, however, only till
he could reveal it all to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Willoughby had, after receiving this in|formation,
no longer a doubt as to breaking
off in&s;tantly his propo&s;ed alliance; but how,
without plunging a dagger in the heart of his
<PB N="168" REF="170">
uncle, to do this, required &s;ome con&s;idera|tion.&mdash;Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth had &s;ent him full di|rections
as to paying off all the incumbrances
upon his e&s;tate, and depo&s;ited the money at
a banker's, where he had al&s;o left a large &s;um
for his own u&s;e; and expecting him to join
the family at Paris, if he did not overtake
them &s;ooner; and was now plea&s;ing him&s;elf
with the idea, that in a very few days the fa|vourite
project of his life would be com|pleted;
and that in adopting the &s;on of his
&s;i&s;ter, and uniting him with his daughter, he
&s;hould tran&s;mit his name and his honours to
po&s;terity with little variation from lineal de|&s;cent&mdash;It
was this hope, that &s;eemed to have
&s;u&s;tained his feeble exi&s;tence to its pre&s;ent pe|riod,
in &s;pite of the numerous infirmities he
laboured under, and even of the pre&s;criptions
and nur&s;ing of Mrs. Calder&mdash;And though it
was impo&s;&s;ible for Willoughby either to love
or e&s;teem &s;uch a man as Lord Ca&s;tlenorth,
yet he felt for him &s;ome regard, as his mo|ther's
brother, and &s;ome pity not only for his
real but his imaginary &s;ufferings, which he
knew mu&s;t be dreadfully increa&s;ed, and per|haps
<PB N="169" REF="171">
become fatal, from &s;o heavy a di&s;ap|pointment
of all his expectations.</P>
<P>He he&s;itated, then, how to act; whether to
write or go to him&mdash;or whether he &s;hould not
rather addre&s;s him&s;elf to Lady Ca&s;tlenorth or
her daughter; and for two days after their
departure, had been unable to re&s;olve on any
thing, when a porter, who immediately di&s;|appeared,
gave to the &s;ervant of the hou&s;e a
letter for him.&mdash;It was evidently written in a
foreign hand, and in a foreign idiom&mdash;though
pains &s;eemed to have been taken to di&s;gui&s;e
both&mdash;The contents were the&s;e:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>One who is and will be always a &s;tranger
to you, takes the liberty to approach you
with this advice &s;o important to you&mdash;and
fearing it may be &s;oon too late&mdash;</P>
<P>You are, Sir, on the point of being
married, as the report goes, to the daughter
of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
your relation&mdash;I have cau&s;e to know that her
heart is belonging to another per&s;on, and only
chagrin and inquietude will be the effect, if
you execute this marriage, whatever may have
<PB N="170" REF="172">
&s;eemed to the contrary.&mdash;If there is any doubt
of the truth of this, a little ob&s;ervation, or
making enquiry among tho&s;e near her, will
explain what I would &s;ay: and if there is
que&s;tion of the per&s;on &s;he has a great friend|&s;hip
for, you have only to think of tho&s;e
who are always with her. A word they &s;ay
to the wi&s;e is enough for them to under&s;tand&mdash;I
have the honour to be,</P>
<CLOSER>With profound re&s;pect,
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your devoted &s;ervant,
Unknown.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Willoughby had no &s;ooner read this letter,
than it &s;truck him that it was written, either
by Cavanaugh him&s;elf, or by &s;ome per&s;on
employed by him&mdash;and his motive evidently
was to prevent a marriage he now &s;aw &s;o
nearly concluded, and which would de&s;troy
all his hopes of &s;ecuring to him&s;elf this opu|lent
heire&s;s&mdash;rather than her mother, who&s;e
lavi&s;h fondne&s;s for him had enabled him&mdash;by
&s;ome means or other&mdash;it was probable they
were not very ju&s;tifiable means, to relea&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="173">
him&s;elf from his former engagements&mdash;en|gagements
which, with far other views, &s;he had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>Many concurring circum&s;tances &s;trength|ened
the per&s;ua&s;ion that this letter was fa|bricated,
if not written, by Cavanaugh.&mdash;It
&s;eemed to be the tran&s;lation of a letter fir&s;t writ|ten
in French, and Willoughby heard that Ca|vanaugh
could not write Engli&s;h with facility
from long di&s;u&s;e.&mdash;It was certainly Cava|naugh's
intere&s;t, by any means, to &s;top the
marriage between him and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
which perhaps no means could have
done more effectually; &s;ince from the tears
&s;he had frequently been ob&s;erved by Ju&s;tina
to &s;hed in their long conferences, it was
probable his arguments had failed of their
effect.</P>
<P>If Willoughby had before felt &s;omething
like antipathy towards Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
which he never could wholly conquer, he
now found it amounting to abhorrence and
dete&s;tation.&mdash;The love &s;he had &s;hewn towards
him mu&s;t either have been the effect of art or
of vice&mdash;and both were to him equally odious.
That &s;he could hope to impo&s;e upon him by
<PB N="172" REF="174">
the one, or think him a proper object for the
indulgence of the other, were ideas equally
hateful and equally humiliating; and under
the fir&s;t impul&s;e of indignation, he was tempt|ed
to write to her, and, inclo&s;ing the letter
from his anonymous corre&s;pondent, add to it
all the circum&s;tances Farnham had learned of
Ju&s;tina, as rea&s;ons why he renounced her with
contempt.</P>
<P>But after a little reflection, his manly and
generous &s;pirit in&s;pired him with far other
de&s;igns.&mdash;It was po&s;&s;ible, that his cou&s;in,
whom he now con&s;idered with as much di&s;|like,
but with more compa&s;&s;ion, might yet
be &s;aved from the artifices of a villain&mdash;and
he thought him&s;elf bound to attempt it by
every exertion, except the &s;acrifice of him|&s;elf
in marriage. It was po&s;&s;ible that his
uncle, though he could not make that &s;a|crifice
to gratify him, might yet be in &s;ome
degree pre&s;erved from the dreadful &s;hock
which his daughter's conduct mu&s;t give him,
were it de&s;cribed to him in the horrid light he
him&s;elf now &s;aw it in; or revealed to him by
any one le&s;s cautious than him&s;elf. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing,
therefore, as the &s;cenes mu&s;t be that he &s;hould
<PB N="173" REF="175">
have to go through, when, in&s;tead of joining
the family, to complete his marriage, he &s;hould
meet them with tho&s;e charges which put an
end to it for ever; he determined to follow
them immediately; and writing to Cathcart
&s;uch in&s;tructions as were mo&s;t requi&s;ite, as to
the management of his affairs, and without
hinting how different the purpo&s;e of his jour|ney
was from what it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be,
he departed as &s;oon as his phy&s;ician di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
him, for the Continent; which was in &s;ome|thing
more than a week after the Ca&s;tlenorths
had left London.</P>
<P>Every body concluded that he was gone to
his bride; and every body's conjectures remain|ed
uncontradicted&mdash;Lady Horatia, in her letters
to Cele&s;tina, told her that Lord Ca&s;tlenorth's
illne&s;s having obliged him to quit England,
on a very &s;hort notice, Willoughby and Mi&s;s
Fitz&mdash;Hayman had been privately warned the
day before they &s;et out; that &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s,
as to his e&s;tates, detained him afterwards five
or &s;ix days in London; but that he was now
gone to the Ca&s;tlenorth family at Paris, and
was to proceed with them to pa&s;s the &s;ummer in
Italy. The &s;ame account found its way into the
<PB N="174" REF="176">
public prints, and was received without any
doubt.&mdash;Cele&s;tina &s;hed many tears over the
fir&s;t information &s;he received, and then ac|cu&s;ing
her&s;elf of folly, tried to dry them, and
to detach her mind from thinking of Wil|loughby&mdash;but
this no effort enabled her to
do; and though all anxiety was now lo&s;t in
the mo&s;t painful certainty, &s;he &s;unk from
fruitle&s;s &s;olicitude into hopele&s;s dejection.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a frame of mind Lady Horatia
found her&mdash;when after a &s;eparation of about
three weeks, &s;he rejoined her at Cheltenham.
With her arrived Montague Thorold, quite
recovered of his wound, deriving from it,
and from thus being allowed to attend Ce|le&s;tina,
more hope than ever; while his love
&s;eemed to have increa&s;ed, if to increa&s;e
were po&s;&s;ible; and while his &s;ufferings and
his merit certainly rendered him intere&s;ting
to Cele&s;tina, and combined to entitle him
to her friend&s;hip, her pity, and e&s;teem;
&s;he felt, and felt with regret, that, decided
as &s;he believed her fate now to be in regard
to Willoughby&mdash;friend&s;hip, e&s;teem, and pity,
were yet all &s;he could give to Montague Tho|rold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WlLLOUGHBY, with every &s;en&s;ation that
could render &s;uch a journey unplea&s;ant, pro|ceeded
to Paris, where he learned that his
uncle impatiently waited for him;&mdash;had he
gone immediately to him, he mu&s;t have
cru&s;h'd at once, all the expectations his appear|ance
raifed: and the &s;hock mu&s;t have been
too great and too cruel. He determined at
fir&s;t, therefore, to write to Lady Ca&s;tlenorth&mdash;yet
after &s;ome reflection, doubted whether it
would not be better to give the letter he had
received to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman; and leave it
to her to find the means of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him,
without his being compelled to a&s;&s;ign the true
rea&s;on. It was &s;till po&s;&s;ible that the charges
again&s;t her might be unfounded or exaggerat|ed.
<PB N="176" REF="178">
It is po&s;&s;ible, that were they neither, he
might re&s;cue her from the aby&s;s to which &s;he
&s;eemeed to be devoting her&s;elf.&mdash;But, from
the pride and violence of her temper, and
from that imperious &s;pirit, which had never
yet borne to be told of an error, he not only
felt great unea&s;ine&s;s from the idea of the &s;cene
that was before him, but doubted whether
the per&s;on for who&s;e &s;ake he was willing to
encounter it, would not baffle all his endea|vours
to re&s;cue her from evil, or conceal her
errors by clamour and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>After &s;ome deliberation, however, as it was
nece&s;&s;ary to fix on &s;omething, he wrote a &s;hort
note to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, de&s;iring &s;he would
favour him with a few moments conver&s;ation;
and entreating her, for rea&s;ons which he would
then explain to her, not to inform Lord or
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth of his arrival at Paris, till
after he had &s;een her.</P>
<P>This note he &s;ent by Farnham to Ju&s;tina,
to be delivered to her mi&s;tre&s;s; and received
in a &s;hort time an an&s;wer, that &s;he &s;hould be
alone that evening at ten o'clock, and that
Ju&s;tina &s;hould conduct him to her, in her own
dre&s;&s;ing room.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">
He found, her &s;itting alone; and, under
the appearance of receiving him with plea&s;ure,
there was, he thought, a lurking apprehen&s;ion
of the occa&s;ion of this my&s;terious vi&s;it.&mdash;He
felt him&s;elf extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how to open
&s;uch a conver&s;ation; but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
rectitude, and &s;ome degree of indignant re&s;ent|ment,
immediately re&s;tored that calmne&s;s and
re&s;olution, which on his fir&s;t entrance he feared
he might fail of commanding.</P>
<P>He began by apologizing for the liberty he
had taken in thus &s;oliciting an interview with
her, before he &s;aw the other parts of the
family. "But, I am per&s;uaded, Madam," con|tinued
he, advancing towards her, with the
letter open in his hand, "that whatever
foundation there may befor the a&s;&s;ertion which
this letter contains, it will be le&s;s unea&s;y to
you to read it your&s;elf&mdash;than to have any ap|peal
made on it to Lord and Lady Ca&s;tle|north."&mdash;She
took the letter with an air of
mingled a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation; but
Willoughby &s;aw it tremble in her hand&mdash;"a
letter, Sir, in which mention is made of me!&mdash;I
am really quite at a lo&s;s to know what
there can be in it, that I &s;hould, in your
<PB N="178" REF="180">
opinion, wi&s;h to have it concealed"&mdash;"It is not
long, Madam," &s;aid Willoughby, fixing his
eyes on her face; "and if you will have the
goodne&s;s to read it"&mdash;"Oh, certainly, Sir"&mdash;She
ran her eyes over it, and as he atten|tively
watched her countenance, he &s;aw pride
&s;truggling to conquer fear and &s;hame, and
with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s; for having read
it, &s;he pau&s;ed a moment, and then a&s;&s;uming
an air of haughty re&s;entment, &s;he threw the
letter on the table that was between her and
Willoughby&mdash;and &s;aid, contemptuou&s;ly, "I
know not whether mo&s;t to de&s;pi&s;e, the Author
of &s;uch a letter, or the man who&mdash;if indeed
he is not included in both de&s;criptions&mdash;can
poorly make it a pretence for in&s;ulting a
per&s;on, who has already been too much his
victim."&mdash;"Pardon me, Madam," &s;aid Wil|loughby,
"for interrupting you; but I mu&s;t
take leave to &s;ay, that I am included in nei|ther&mdash;a
moment's reflection will convince you
that I am incapable of the latter; and had the
former been my object, I &s;hould not have
cho&s;en this method of &s;hewing this extraordi|nary
billet to you; nor thus put it in your
power to detect the author, without any ha|zard
<PB N="179" REF="181">
to your&s;elf of having his charges be|lieved.
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, I will be very
ingenuous with you:&mdash;the per&s;on here alluded
to, is Captain Cavanaugh&mdash;I know it: I know
that the partiality, whether real or affected,
with which you have appeared to favor me,
has been &s;uper&s;eded by his more eminent merit;
and, though I am very willing to relinqui&s;h all
pro&s;pect of an honor of which I am unworthy,&mdash;I
cannot feel much &s;atisfaction, in reflect|ing
on the idea you &s;eemed to have enter|tained
of my facility or blindne&s;s;&mdash;nor, in|deed,
can I, without regret, &s;ee you likely
to&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Say, rather, Sir," interrupted Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman&mdash;"Say,
rather, that you rejoice in
having found, or made, an excu&s;e to break
through the promi&s;es you have given&mdash;from
which, however, Sir, you would have been
relea&s;ed without degrading your&s;elf, by this
poor and unmanly artifice.&mdash;The daughter of
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth need not, &s;urely, &s;olicit the
hand of any man." Pride and anger now choak|ed
her utterance; and Willoughby, taking ad|vantage
of her want of words, again &s;eized the
opportunity to &s;peak; he took her hand
<PB N="180" REF="182">
which &s;he would have &s;natched from him,
but he continued to detain it, while, in the
gentle&s;t accents of friendly remon&s;trance, he
&s;aid, "Come, come, my dear cou&s;in&mdash;if I
am not your lover&mdash;at lea&s;t, I can never be
your enemy.&mdash;For Heaven's &s;ake, be not your
own; confide in me, and believe that I will
rather take the blame and inconvenience of
our &s;eparation on my&s;elf, than &s;uffer you to in|cur
either with your father&mdash;you cannot &s;up|po&s;e,
I tru&s;t you do not even wi&s;h, I &s;hould
proceed farther in forming the alliance that
brought me hither, knowing what I know."</P>
<P>"And what do you know, Sir; and from
whom have you obtained this knowledge."</P>
<P>"From &s;ources, which render it impo&s;&s;ible
that I &s;hould be mi&s;taken&mdash;Captain Cava|naugh."</P>
<P>He was proceeding; but, either from the
tone in which he &s;poke, or &s;ome other circum|&s;tance
which at that moment &s;truck her, &s;he
was &s;uddenly impre&s;&s;ed with a fear that he had
been calling Cavanaugh him&s;elf to an account;
who, as it happened, had not that day dined
with them.&mdash;This idea threw her in&s;tantly
off her guard&mdash;&s;he turned pale, and a&s;ked in
<PB N="181" REF="183">
an altered and tremulous tone&mdash;"what he
meant by the&s;e &s;ources of information?"</P>
<P>Willoughby &s;aw immediately what &s;he be|lieved;
and the truth of the information he
had received from Ju&s;tina was evident beyond
a doubt. Her fears for her own reputation,
or of the anger of her father, &s;he could con|quer;
but the moment &s;he apprehended that
the life of Cavanaugh either had been, or
might be hazarded, her fortitude failed her.
It was now the moment to pur&s;ue the truth,
which Willoughby, by &s;oothing her, while he
kept the idea of her lover's danger in view,
at length, with great difficulty, obtained, by
her half indignant, half contrite avowal&mdash;that
Cavanaugh had been a too &s;ucce&s;sful candi|date
for her heart&mdash;and that her father and
her mother's eager wi&s;hes, together with &s;ome
other motives, which Willoughby di&s;cerned,
through the confu&s;ion and agitation with
which &s;he attempted to palliate or conceal
them, had prompted her to affect for him a
pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had not felt &s;ince &s;he had been in
the habits of li&s;tening to Cavanaugh.</P>
<P>Willoughby looked back with terror to the
danger he had e&s;caped&mdash;and with infinite pity,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
mingled with le&s;s gentle emotions, ca&s;t his eyes
again on his cou&s;in; he found her &s;o deeply
entangled by the art of Cavanaugh, that to
&s;ave her from him, was no longer in his
power; but it was po&s;&s;ible perhaps to take
upon him&s;elf the anger and indignation of
Lord and Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, and give her time
to arrange her own plans, by immediately
withdrawing in &s;ilence; though, how any com|fortable
arrangement could be made for her,
with a man who was under&s;tood to be already
married, he knew not; nor how Lady Ca&s;tle|north
would bear &s;o cruel a blow, as the
preference thus given to her daughter by a
man whom &s;he certainly had intended as &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
to her pre&s;ent hu&s;band, whenever his in|firmities
&s;hould relea&s;e her. When the fir&s;t
tumult of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which fear, &s;hame,
and love, had excited in the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, &s;ub&s;ided, by the kind and con|&s;iderate
arguments of Willoughby, &s;he be|came
able to talk with &s;ome degree of calm|ne&s;s
on the &s;ubject; and he found that from
the la&s;t renewal of their acquaintance with Cap|tain
Cavanaugh, this de&s;ign had been certainly
entertained by Lady Ca&s;tlenorth; but that, on
<PB N="183" REF="185">
his part, no other advantage had been taken
of her extreme partiality towards him, than
to obtain, by her means, money to enable
him to pro&s;ecute a divorce from his wife&mdash;a
young woman whom he had married &s;ome
years before for the &s;ake of &s;ome fortune, and
a great deal of beauty, which &s;he then po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Having
in two or three years di&s;&s;i|pated
the former, he left her to make what
advantage &s;he could of the latter; and had
never troubled him&s;elf about her &s;ince, till
his reception in the family of Lord Ca&s;tle|north
opened to him pro&s;pects of carrying off
the rich heire&s;s&mdash;and made him de&s;irous of ob|taining
a di&s;&s;olution of his marriage, for which
his wife's ill conduct, though entirely owing
to his de&s;ertion of her, gave him a very
good pretence. Much of this Willoughby
learned from various little circum&s;tances
which e&s;caped Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman in this
long conver&s;ation; for her repre&s;entation of
him was, that of the mo&s;t amiable and un|fortunate
of men; married early in life to a
woman in&s;en&s;ible of his merit; and now ren|dered
unhappy by a pa&s;&s;ion for another ob|ject,
whom he had long &s;een on the point of
<PB N="184" REF="186">
being given to a rival, who &s;aw her with very
different eyes.</P>
<P>Willoughby could not, without a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
ob&s;erve the blind infatuation of a wo|man,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rather a good under&s;tand|ing:
but he found that the art of Cavanaugh,
to the &s;ucce&s;s of which his very hand&s;ome
figure had undoubtedly contributed, had &s;o
completely attained the government of Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman's mind, that &s;he no longer &s;aw
but with his eyes; and that while, to prevent
any &s;u&s;picion on the part of her mother, &s;he
had been &s;uffered to affect a degree of affec|tion
for Willoughby, which had long &s;ince
cea&s;ed&mdash;Cavanaugh tru&s;ted to his reluctance
to delay a marriage, which it was ea&s;y to &s;ee he
dreaded; and hoped that the divorce would be
obtained before that reluctance would be con|quered&mdash;he
found, however, that Willoughby
&s;uddenly agreed to ha&s;ten it; and then it was
that, in his conference with her, after the re&s;t of
the family were in bed, he urged her to find
delays; and to procra&s;tinate, her&s;elf, a period,
to the arrival of which Willoughby no longer
&s;eemed aver&s;e.&mdash;Her tears, and the alarm in
which Ju&s;tina had ob&s;erved her, were the effects
<PB N="185" REF="187">
of the earne&s;tne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity with which
Cavanaugh now pre&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of her
doing this; and the alternative he &s;ometimes
offered her, of declaring to Willoughby him|&s;elf,
the footing upon which he was with her.&mdash;Her
father's illne&s;s, fortunately for her, inter|vened;
and now Cavanaugh was every hour in
hopes that he &s;hould be &s;et free from his ma|trimonial
engagements&mdash;and po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf
of the prize &s;o long the object of his ambi|tion,
and the end of all his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman and Willoughby now
were to di&s;cu&s;s the means by which, with
the lea&s;t prejudice to her, their intended
union could then be broken off.&mdash;The lady,
though &s;he did not ingenuou&s;ly own it, had
many rea&s;ons for accepting, unconditionally,
her cou&s;in's generous offer, to take the whole
burthen of their di&s;plea&s;ure upon him&s;elf.&mdash;She
knew, hot only the extravagant and furi|ous
pa&s;&s;ions which any &s;u&s;picion of its real
cau&s;e would excite in her mother, but &s;he
was aware of the increa&s;ing fondne&s;s of her
father for his nephew; and apprehended,
that if he appeared the injured and for&s;aken
per&s;on, that fondne&s;s might urge him to make
<PB N="186" REF="188">
him amends, by giving him a part of the
great &s;ums and e&s;tates that were in his own
power&mdash;and this, rich as &s;he would &s;till have
been, &s;he had not any di&s;po&s;ition to pro|mote.</P>
<P>After &s;ome debate, then, in what way
Willoughby &s;hould excu&s;e him&s;elf, and his
rejection (on account of their fal&s;ehood) of
&s;ome method which Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman pro|po&s;ed;
he at length determined to write to
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, &s;tating &s;imply, that he
had changed his mind, and found it impo&s;&s;i|ble
to fulfil his engagements: and leave it to
her to break it to her Lord as &s;he thought
proper; for he imagined any letter from him|&s;elf
might be a &s;till &s;everer &s;hock, unle&s;s he
could a&s;&s;ign better rea&s;ons than any it was
po&s;&s;ible for him to offer.</P>
<P>This point being &s;ettled, Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man
retired to recover her&s;elf from the effects
of the &s;cene &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed through; and to
&s;tudy her part in tho&s;e that were to come.&mdash;Willoughby
returned, un&s;een by all but Ju&s;|tina,
to his hotel; where he compo&s;ed a &s;hort
note to the purport they had agreed Upon;
and early the next morning he &s;et out on
<PB N="187" REF="189">
hor&s;eback for Lyons, from whence he intend|ed
to proceed, along the coa&s;t of the Medi|terranean,
to the Pyrenees, and to pa&s;s &s;ome
weeks among tho&s;e mountains which he had
never yet &s;een.</P>
<P>The recent and extraordinary events that
had befallen him, gave his mind &s;ufficient
&s;ubject for contemplation, during the fir&s;t
part of his journey.&mdash;It was now very certain
that he was for ever relea&s;ed, and that by
means which left him nothing to reproach
him&s;elf with, from his engagements with Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, and of cour&s;e from that pro|mi&s;e
to his mother, in con&s;equence of which
tho&s;e engagements were made.&mdash;One great
objection, then, to his union with Cele&s;tina
was thus removed; and never did her image
more tenderly occupy his thoughts than at
this moment: but, alas! it was no longer
cheri&s;hed with delight. The my&s;tery that
clouded her birth, and which he de&s;paired of
ever removing, empoi&s;oned the plea&s;ure with
which he would have thought of her; and
with yet greater bitterne&s;s, he adverted to the
probability there was that &s;he was now the
wife of another.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
Very certain that he &s;hould now never find
that happine&s;s of which her lo&s;s had deprived
him, the le&s;&s;er evils&mdash;evils from which, a few
years before, he would have &s;hrunk with di&s;|may,
&s;eemed to have lo&s;t their effect.&mdash;It was
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him, without inju&s;tice
to others and unea&s;ine&s;s to him&s;elf, to keep &s;uch
a place as Alve&s;tone, in the pre&s;ent &s;hattered
&s;tate of his fortune; and re&s;olving to di&s;em|barra&s;s
him&s;elf from the nece&s;&s;ity of returning
to England, for &s;ome years, he wrote from
Lyons, to Cathcart, giving him directions to
put the e&s;tate to &s;ale: and at the &s;ame time
informed the banker, in who&s;e hands Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth had left money for the di&s;charge
of all his incumbrances, that he &s;hould not
avail him&s;elf of it; but that it mu&s;t be re|placed
to his uncle's account.</P>
<P>Having thus loo&s;ened almo&s;t every tie that
connected him with England, from which he
did not wi&s;h even to hear, left the inform|ation
of Cele&s;tina's marriage &s;hould reach
him,
<Q>The World was all before him where to chu&s;e;</Q>
<PB N="189" REF="191">
and his utmo&s;t hope was, to obtain, by change
of place, &s;o much tranquillity of mind, as to
allow him to feel &s;ome &s;atisfaction in the va|riety
of the &s;cenes it offered.</P>
<P>He journeyed from Lyons to Avignon;
and then proceeded along the coa&s;t, by Be|zieres
and Mirepoix, into Rou&s;&s;illon: intere&s;ted
by the grandeur and beauty of the&s;e remains
of Roman antiquity which he &s;aw in his way;
&s;till more charmed by the &s;ublime views,
which, in this romantic line of country, every
where offered them&s;elves to his &s;ight; and
hearing, and <HI>but</HI> hearing, at a di&s;tance, the
tumults, with which a noble &s;truggle for free|dom
at this time (the &s;ummer of 1789) agi|tated
the capital, and many of the great
towns of France, till, among the wild and
&s;tupendous &s;cenes which he at length reached,
even this faint murmur died away.</P>
<P>In one of the cottages &s;cattered at the foot
of Montlouis, he found a young mountaineer,
acquainted with all the pa&s;&s;es of the Pyrenees:
he was there only for a few days, on his way
back from Perpignan to his home, in the
Vallei de Douron; and on Willoughby pro|po&s;ing
<PB N="190" REF="192">
it to him, he mo&s;t willingly undertook
to be his guide through the mountains.</P>
<P>Willoughby had left his hor&s;es at Perpig|nan,
and his pre&s;ent equipage con&s;i&s;ted only
of Farnham, carrying a light portmanteau,
and a &s;ort of havre&s;ac for provi&s;ions, which
he took him&s;elf, &s;trapped over his &s;houlders.</P>
<P>On the morning of his departure from the
foot of Montlouis, he travelled towards the
&s;outh-ea&s;t, always a&s;cending, and was &s;oon
in the very heart of the Pyrenees. In &s;cenes
which had hardly ever been traver&s;ed but by
the &s;hepherds and goat-herds, and where no
ve&s;tiges of man were &s;een, but here and there
a &s;olitary cabin, &s;erving them for &s;helter,
during a few weeks of &s;ummer, built of the
rough branches of pine or che&s;nut, covered
with turf, and lined with mo&s;s.&mdash;In the&s;e huts,
which were now &s;ome of them inhabited,
Willoughby found a wild, but &s;imple and
benevolent people; always ready to &s;upply
him with &s;uch food as their flocks, among
tho&s;e de&s;ert regions, afforded to them&s;elves;
and in one of them, on a temporary bed,
made of the &s;kins of their &s;heep, whom acci|dent
had de&s;troyed, after a deep &s;igh, which
<PB N="191" REF="193">
was drawn from him by the memory of Ce|le&s;tina,
and with which every day concluded,
he obtained a few hours of refre&s;hing &s;leep,
and with the dawn of the next day pur&s;ued
his journey towards the &s;ummit of the moun|tain.</P>
<P>Amid the&s;e paths that wound among the
almo&s;t perpendicular points of the cliffs, he
often &s;at down; &s;urveying with awe and ad|miration
the &s;tupendous works of the Divine
Architect, before who&s;e &s;imple&s;t creation, the
laboured productions of the mo&s;t intelligent
of his, creatures &s;ink into in&s;ignificance.&mdash;Huge
ma&s;&s;es of grey marble, or a dark gra|nite,
frowned above his head; who&s;e crevices,
here and there, afforded a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
to lickens and mo&s;s campion; while the de&s;o|late
barrenne&s;s of other parts, added to that
threatening a&s;pect with which they &s;eemed
to hang over the wandering traveller, and to
bid him to fear, left even the light &s;teps of
the Izard (the Chamois of the Pyrenees),
or the wild goats, who now and then ap|appeared
&s;u&s;pended amid the craggy fi&s;&s;ures,
&s;houldd i&s;unite them from the mountain it|&s;elf,
<PB N="192" REF="194">
and bury him beneath their thundering
ruins.</P>
<P>Da&s;hing down among&s;t the&s;e immen&s;e piles
of &s;tone, the cataracts, formed by the melting
of the &s;nows, and the ice of the glacieres, in
the bo&s;om of the mountains, fell roaring into
dark and aby&s;s-like cha&s;ms, whither the eye
feared to follow them&mdash;yet, frequently, amid&s;t
the wilde&s;t horrors of the&s;e great objects, ap|peared
&s;ome little green rece&s;s, &s;haded by im|men&s;e
pines, cedars, or mountain-a&s;h; and
the &s;hort turf beneath them appeared &s;pangled
with the Soldinella and fringed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dianthus &s;uperbus.</NOTE> pink, or
blu&s;hing with the &s;cented wreaths of the
Daphne Cneorum&mdash;while through the cracks
and hollows of the &s;urrounding wall of rock,
were filtered &s;mall and clear &s;treams, that crept
away among the tufts of juniper, ro&s;emary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rhododendron Alpina; dwarf ro&s;ehay. This plant &s;upplies firing to the &s;hepherds of the Pyrenees.</NOTE>,
and the Rhododendron of the Alps, that
clothed the le&s;s-abrupt declivity; where, un|interrupted
by intervening crags, the moun|tain
&s;helving gradually to its ba&s;e, opened a
<PB N="193" REF="195">
bo&s;om more &s;miling and fertile; through
which the collected waters, no longer foaming
from their fall, found their way towards the
Mediterranean &s;ea; their banks feathered with
woods of cork trees, che&s;nuts, and evergreen
oaks&mdash;while the eye, carried beyond them,
was lo&s;t in the wide and luxuriant plains of
Languedoc.</P>
<P>Never did &s;uch a &s;pot offer it&s;elf to the
eyes of Willoughby, but the figure of Cele&s;|tina
was in&s;tantly pre&s;ent to his imagination&mdash;he
&s;aw her &s;itting by him, enjoying the beau|tiful
and romantic &s;cenery; he heard her, in
tho&s;e accents which had, long &s;uch power to
enchant him, expatiate on its charms, with
all that exqui&s;ite ta&s;te and feeling he knew
her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and remembering a charm|ing
de&s;cription given by Rou&s;&s;eau, in his
Julie, of a &s;pot of this &s;ort among the rocks
of Meillerie.&mdash;"II &s;embloit que ce lieu d&eacute;|&s;ert,
d&ucirc;t &ecirc;tre l'a&s;yle de deux amants; &eacute;chapp&eacute;s
&s;euls au boulever&s;ement de la nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eemed that this de&s;art &s;pot was de&s;igned as an a&s;ylum for two lovers, who had e&s;caped the general wreck of nature.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">
For a moment or two he indulged &s;uch a
delicious reverie, till the &s;udden recollection
of the truth cruelly de&s;troyed it.&mdash;Cele&s;tina
was not, never could be his&mdash;never could
&s;hare with him the &s;imple and &s;ublime de|light
offered by the &s;uperb &s;pectacle of na|ture&mdash;"with
all her great works about her."
Whether he was among the rude mountains
that &s;he has rai&s;ed as a barrier, to divide two
powerful nations; or gratified with the more
mild beauties of his native country, never
could &s;he &s;hare in his &s;atisfaction, or heighten
his enjoyment&mdash;but her hours and her talents
were all de&s;tined to make the happine&s;s of
Montague Thorold.&mdash;At that idea he &s;tarted
up, and hardly con&s;cious of the rugged pre|cipices
beneath him, renewed his wandering
re&s;earches; and &s;ought, by activity of body,
to cha&s;e the fearful phantoms of lo&s;t happi|ne&s;s
that haunted his mind.</P>
<P>He had now pa&s;&s;ed three weeks among the
Pyrenees; had traver&s;ed &s;everal Glaciers, and
de&s;cended on the Spani&s;h &s;ide, and looked
over part of Catalonia.&mdash;Again he took his
way to their &s;ummits; again cro&s;&s;ed deep
<PB N="195" REF="197">
vallies of ice, and wandered over regions
where winter reigns in all its rigour, though
under a &s;ky of the deepe&s;t blue, illuminated by
the ardent &s;un of July; a &s;ky &s;o clear, that
not even a fleeting &s;ummer cloud, for a mo|ment,
diver&s;ifies its radiance.&mdash;One of the
talle&s;t of the&s;e &s;tupendous points is, Le pie du
midi de Bagneus, which &s;eems to be the &s;o|vereign
of the inferior points around it:&mdash;from
its tall head he de&s;cended to Bagniers;
and there meaning to clo&s;e his re&s;earches, he
re&s;ted &s;ome days, and then, by another route,
returned towards the country of Rou&s;&s;illon,
from whence he had fir&s;t begun his journey.</P>
<P>But when he arrived there, he had nothing
to do but to form &s;ome &s;cheme of farther pro|gre&s;s;
and therefore, plea&s;ed as he was with
the variety and novelty offered him by this
long chain of immen&s;e mountains, he deter|mined
to lengthen his &s;tay among&s;t them.&mdash;His
guide, who had by this time acquired an
affection for him, delighted to carry him to
every place that he thought might offer either
novelty or amu&s;ement&mdash;and he now conver&s;ed
with the &s;muggler, who conveyed, at the ex|treme&s;t
peril, prohibited articles of commerce
<PB N="196" REF="198">
between France and Spain; now joined the
&s;olitary hunter of the Izard, or &s;maller Cha|mois;
and now &s;hared the more dangerous
toils of tho&s;e who &s;ought the bear, the wild
boar, or the wolf, among the deep woods that
clothed the &s;ides of the mountains.</P>
<P>It was in an excur&s;ion with an hunter of
the Izard, that, Farnham having been left be|hind
at the cabin of a &s;hepherd where Wil|loughby
intended to pa&s;s the night, he and
Ga&s;ton, his guide, were, by an accident, &s;e|parated;
and he found him&s;elf alone&mdash;on one
of the mo&s;t &s;avage &s;pots of the whole chain&mdash;above
him aro&s;e a point covered by eternal
&s;now; beyond which a Glacier &s;pread its de&s;olate
and frozen &s;urface for &s;ome miles, &s;urrounded
every way by &s;harp and barren rocks: on one
&s;ide, fed by this magazine of ice and &s;now, a
broad and thundering torrent threw it&s;elf; fall|ing,
with deafening noi&s;e, into a rocky cauldron,
&s;o far below that the eye could not fathom it.&mdash;A
dark and apparently inacce&s;&s;ible wood of
firs was on the other &s;ide, where no tree or
plant could find its abode, that was not equally
able to endure the &s;everity of tho&s;e cold winds,
that, pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e immen&s;e magazines of
<PB N="197" REF="199">
ice, carry with them fro&s;t and de&s;olation, even
into the rich vineyards and luxuriant pa&s;|tures
of Ga&s;cony and Languedoc, and there
a&s;&s;ume the name of the Bize-wind.</P>
<P>Willoughby had lingered &s;o long among
the&s;e mountains, that it was now the &s;econd
week of Augu&s;t.&mdash;The evenings were, of
cour&s;e, &s;omewhat &s;hortening; and the &s;un was
vi&s;ible only by reflection from the &s;nowy point
above him, when he found him&s;elf lo&s;t on a
place where he knew not his way to any hu|man
habitation, or was likely to hear the
&s;ound of a human voice.&mdash;Little accu&s;tomed,
however, to fear of any kind, he &s;at him&s;elf
down on a piece of broken rock, to con&s;ider
if, by any of tho&s;e remarks which Ga&s;ton had
taught him to make, he could find his way
before, night-fall to rejoin his &s;ervant and his
guide, or to find at lea&s;t &s;ome place of &s;helter.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, however, were impeded
by the clouds that &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the
exten&s;ive plains below him, and to gather
round the ba&s;e of the mountains.&mdash;The&s;e in|crea&s;ed
every moment, and at length &s;ur|rounded
him like waves; &s;o that he no longer
di&s;tingui&s;hed the objects beneath him, while
<PB N="198" REF="200">
immen&s;e volumes of white vapour were
poured like a &s;ea between him and the neigh|bouring
precipices.&mdash;He heard louder than
ever, but he no longer &s;aw the torrent that
threw it&s;elf down within a few yards of
him; and had apprehen&s;ion ever been, under
any circum&s;tances, trouble&s;ome to him, he now
might well have feared that, lo&s;t in this chaos
of mi&s;t, he &s;hould at lea&s;t remain all night
where he was, and perhaps never regain his
companions at all.</P>
<P>Life, however, had &s;o few charms for him
at this moment, that his indifference for it,
added to his natural courage, when only him|&s;elf
was in que&s;tion, made him perfectly calm
and collected&mdash;though the thick clouds of
mi&s;t continued to gather and darken round
the &s;pot where he was now compelled to re|main.</P>
<P>For a few moments the &s;ighing of the wind
which bore this floating vapour, the increa&s;ed
hollow murmurs of the ru&s;hing waters of the
cataract, were interrupted only by the &s;cream|ing
vulture, and the deep hoar&s;e raven, who
&s;eemed by their cries, as they failed above the
grey aby&s;s of mi&s;t, to be warning their com|panions
<PB N="199" REF="201">
of &s;ome approaching danger: thunder
was in fact gathered in the bo&s;om of the&s;e
clouds, and Willoughby, as he &s;at on his &s;o|litary
rock, heard it muttering at his feet;
and after &s;ome tremendous bur&s;ts, which
&s;eemed to &s;hake the mountains to their foun|dations,
accompanied by blue and vivid
lightning, a violent wind aro&s;e, and di&s;per&s;|ing
the foggy clouds, drove them, with the
&s;torm generated in their bo&s;om, to the coun|try
beneath.</P>
<P>The la&s;t rays of the departed &s;un were now
reflected from the &s;ummits of &s;now, the air
became perfectly &s;erene and Willoughby &s;aw
di&s;tinctly every object around him. He ob|&s;erved
at &s;ome di&s;tance to the left a cro&s;s, in
an elevated &s;ituation, but far below the ex|treme&s;t
point of the cliffs; and he recollected,
that the day before Ga&s;ton had &s;hewn him
that cro&s;s, and had told him that near it
was the re&s;idence of a &s;hepherd; and that not
far from it a convent, near the foot of the
mountain.&mdash;Towards this, therefore, he now
endeavoured to find his way; and by the help
of a &s;tick, with an iron fixed at the end of it,
<PB N="200" REF="202">
and by his own activity, he at length pa&s;&s;ed
difficulties that to many people would have
&s;eemed in&s;urmountable; and, attended only
by a terrier which had followed him from
England, and which had been the faithful
companion of all his wanderings, he reached
the pointed rock where the cro&s;s was erected.</P>
<P>It was now, however, &s;o late, that he began
to de&s;pair of finding the hut which Ga&s;ton had
told him was &s;ituated &s;omething lower down.
The moon, indeed, was ri&s;ing in maje&s;tic
beauty behind him; but her light, he feared,
would hardly be &s;ufficient to guide him
among the woods and crags with which he
was &s;urrounded, to an object, perhaps, entirely
concealed within them, and with which he
was wholly unacquainted.&mdash;He fat down,
however, till &s;he &s;hould afford him more be|nefit,
and to con&s;ider what he &s;hould do&mdash;when,
amid&s;t the &s;ilence of the night, the
&s;ound of a human voice, in &s;low cadence, ac|companied
by &s;ome mu&s;ical in&s;trument, was
borne on the faint breeze that aro&s;e from
the low-lands.&mdash;He li&s;tened&mdash;it was not
the iilu&s;ion of fancy, as he had for a mo|ment
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;uppo&s;ed; and he involuntarily ex|claimed&mdash;
<Q><L>O, it came o'er mine ear, like the &s;weet &s;outh,</L>
<L>That breathes upon a bank of violets&mdash;</L>
<L>Stealing and giving odour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
His dog, too, gave evident &s;igns of hearing
&s;omething unu&s;ual&mdash;ran from his ma&s;ter to
the brink of the precipice&mdash;then returned
jumping towards him, and &s;eemed rejoiced
that they were once more within reach of a
human habitation.&mdash;His &s;agacity a&s;&s;i&s;ted his
ma&s;ter to follow the &s;ound; and de&s;cending
the, mountain, by an entangled and almo&s;t
overgrown &s;heep-path, that led from one
pointed rock to another, he at length entered
one of tho&s;e woods of larch, pine, and che&s;|nut,
that fill many of the hollow bo&s;oms of
the Pyrenees; and though the trees rendered
it entirely dark, the mu&s;ic, which &s;till con|tinued
at &s;hort intervals to float in the air,
led him on, till, in a &s;mall glade, over&s;hadow|ed
by rocks clothed with bru&s;h-wood, he &s;aw
<PB N="202" REF="204">
a &s;mall cabin, or rather cottage, where he
had no doubt of finding an a&s;ylum for the
night: his terrier now run gaily before him,
and was pre&s;ently &s;aluted by the loud barking
of tho&s;e dogs which guard the Pyrenean flocks&mdash;but
on meeting, the animals courteou&s;ly &s;a|luted
each other, and the &s;hepherds dog &s;eem|ed
glad to &s;hew the &s;trangers to his ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>THE moon, though not yet ri&s;en above
the trees, which on every &s;ide &s;haded the
rocks &s;urrounding this &s;olitary glen, yet af|forded
general light enough for Willoughby
to perceive a groupe of pea&s;ants a&s;&s;embled
round the door of a cottage, &s;uperior in &s;ize
to any of the cabins of the &s;hepherds which
he had yet vi&s;ited.&mdash;As he approached, the
founds which had guided him towards it
cea&s;ed; and a man advanced to meet him,
who&s;e air and manner were very different
from the native, mountaineers whom he had
been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee, though his dre&s;s was
nearly the &s;ame. Willoughby acco&s;ted him
in French, told him he was a &s;tranger who
had lo&s;t his guide, and de&s;ired to be permitted
to remain in his cottage till the morning
<PB N="204" REF="206">
enabled him to find his companions.&mdash;The
man to whom he &s;poke hardly allowed him
to fini&s;h the &s;entence, before, in language un|adulterated
with the Patois which is &s;poken in
that country, and is a coar&s;e mixture of Spa|ni&s;h
and French, he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;o|licitude
for his accommodation&mdash;and leading
him to the door of the cottage, pre&s;ented
him to his wife, to an old man her father,
and to &s;everal young people whom his mu&s;ic
had a&s;&s;embled round the cabin&mdash;and who
were inhabitants of a little group of cottages
di&s;per&s;ed at &s;hort intervals among the woods
on this part of the Vall&eacute;e de Lou&s;on.</P>
<P>Every individual of this &s;imple party was
eager to &s;hew civility and attention to the
&s;tranger.&mdash;"Loui&s;on," &s;aid he, who appeared
to be the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and who had
met Willoughby&mdash;"Loui&s;on, go and pre|pare
what our cottage affords, to refre&s;h this
gentleman, who may well have occa&s;ion for
it, after &s;uch fatigue as he has gone through."
Willoughby owned he was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted&mdash;and
in a moment, milk, bread, and &s;uch other
&s;imple food as they them&s;elves lived upon,
were before him.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="207">
With the &s;ame ho&s;pitable &s;implicity, Loui|&s;on
went again, at her hu&s;band's reque&s;t, to
prepare him a bed, which one of the younger
brothers of his ho&s;t relinqui&s;hed to him; &s;ay|ing,
he could find a lodging that night at a
neighbouring cottage.&mdash;Le Laurier, which he
found was the name of his ho&s;t, then pre&s;&s;ed
him to retire to his bed&mdash;but Willoughby,
refre&s;hed by what he had eaten, found his
curio&s;ity &s;o &s;trongly excited, by the manners
and language of this man, that it became more
powerful than fatigue&mdash;and he could not help
expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h, to know how a man, who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch mu&s;ical talents, and who&s;e con|ver&s;ation
was certainly not that of a moun|taineer,
&s;hould be found inhabiting a feque&s;|tered
nook, in the bo&s;om of the Pyrenees.</P>
<P>"I inhabit it, Sir," replied Le Laurier,
"becau&s;e I was born in it; but it is true,
that I have al&s;o &s;een a great deal of other
parts of the world&mdash;and that it is not yet a
a month &s;ince I quitted the capital of France,
to return hither, after a very long ab&s;ence."&mdash;"Long,
indeed," &s;aid his wife, who had now
rejoined them&mdash;"Alas! &s;o long"&mdash;and &s;he
<PB N="206" REF="208">
&s;ighed deeply&mdash;"that I never expected, Sir,
to have &s;een him again."</P>
<P>Let me hear", &s;aid Willoughby, "not
only what you have to relate of your&s;elf,
but what is now pa&s;&s;ing at Paris, which you
&s;ay you have &s;o lately left&mdash;I have been
&s;o long, wandering among the&s;e mountains,
that I am wholly ignorant of the con&s;equencs
of that fermentation which was evident there
among all ranks of men when I pa&s;&s;ed through
it?"</P>
<P>"And I was in the mid&s;t of it all, Sir,"
replied Le Laurier&mdash;"for my ma&s;ter, Cheva|lier
de Bellegarde, was among the pri&s;oners
who were relea&s;ed from the ca&s;tle of Mount
St. Michell&mdash;but our hi&s;tory is too long for
this evening:"&mdash;he gave, however, a brief
detail to. Willoughby, of what had pa&s;&s;ed at
Paris the preceding July&mdash;and then, gaily
turning the conver&s;ation, &s;aid&mdash;"Well, Sir,
but here am I, after all this, returned to my
cottage in the Pyrenees, and here is Loui&s;on
and my family&mdash;we are all happy together&mdash;and
what is yet better, my dear ma&s;ter is re|&s;tored
to his home here below us."&mdash;"And
where is his home?" "Oh, Sir, the Chateau
<PB N="207" REF="209">
of Rochemarte, where his family have lived
&s;ince the beginning of the world, I believe,
is ju&s;t down in the valley&mdash;have you never
&s;een it?&mdash;to-morrow, plea&s;e Heaven, you
&s;hall&mdash;and you &s;hall &s;ee my ma&s;ter&mdash;who is
now indeed the Count of Bellegarde&mdash;for his
father and brother are dead&mdash;you &s;hall &s;ee him,
Sir; and &s;ee how a man enjoys liberty that
has been a pri&s;oner &s;o many years,&mdash;Not, in|deed,
that he is &s;o happy as &s;ome people would
be, becau&s;e of the misfortunes in the beginning
of his life&mdash;which always hang upon his
mind&mdash;but now, I hope, in time, he will get
over them.&mdash;For my part, I think it folly to
lament what we cannot help, or regret what
cannot be recalled&mdash;and I wi&s;h the Cheva|lier
was of my di&s;po&s;ition."</P>
<P>"'Tis a very fortunate one, at lea&s;t for
your&s;elf," replied Willoughby&mdash;"and has
undoubtedly helped you gaily through the
world." "No, Sir, not gaily&mdash;but tole|rably;
amid&s;t the &s;evere&s;t of tho&s;e misfor|tunes,
which I &s;hared with the Chevalier, I
had always a per&s;ua&s;ion that I &s;hould revi&s;it
my cottage, and my Loui&s;on."&mdash;"Ah, thank
Heaven, your per&s;ua&s;ion was a ju&s;t one, my
<PB N="208" REF="210">
friend," replied his wife&mdash;and now that we
may not part with melancholy impre&s;&s;ions
on our minds, let us have a little more
mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>Le Laurier then began to play on the in|&s;trument
Willoughby had before heard, and
which was &s;omething between a lute and a
Spani&s;h guitar&mdash;he touched it with uncom|mon
ta&s;te, and &s;ang a &s;imple ru&s;tic air; the
cadence was &s;olemn and pathetic, and at every
clo&s;e, the female part of his auditory joined
their voices in uni&s;on.&mdash;Willoughby had now
time to ob&s;erve the groupe before him by the
clear light of the moon, which ca&s;t a mild
and unclouded radience around them&mdash;The
&s;cene was &s;imple and affecting&mdash;Le Laurier,
a fine manly figure, &s;at on a feat of turf by
the &s;ide, of his door&mdash;His wife, a very hand|&s;ome
woman, &s;tood leaning again&s;t the &s;ide of
it, her head inclined towards him; a girl,
twelve or thirteen years old, who was his
elde&s;t daughter, leaned on the turf, and looked
up towards him, with a fort of innocent and
affectionate admiration; while a boy of &s;even,
the younge&s;t of his children, had fallen a&s;leep
as he &s;at at her feet, and re&s;ted his head on
<PB N="209" REF="211">
her lap;&mdash;two or three young pea&s;ants were
behind, li&s;tening to the mu&s;ic, and gazing at
the &s;tranger; and, in a chair, before the door,
the venerable father of the family, &s;at, con|templating
the felicity &s;o lately re&s;tored to
them all, by the return of Le Laurier&mdash;with
the mild re&s;ignation of repo&s;ing age.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and fragrant &s;mells floated in the
air, after the rain; and the lighte&s;t wind
whi&s;pered among the woods by which they
were every way &s;urrounded.&mdash;Not a &s;ound
interrupted the plaintive pa&s;toral air, which
the performer now began to play, while
his wife and daughter alternately &s;ung a
&s;tanza.&mdash;It was a kind of romance in Pa|tois&mdash;but
Willoughby under&s;tood it to
be the complaint of a mountain &s;hepherd,
who&s;e mi&s;tre&s;s had for&s;aken him for a richer
e&s;tabli&s;hment.&mdash;There was nothing new in it,
but it was the language of nature, and brought
forcibly to the mind of Willoughby his own
misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212">
The &s;oothing melancholy which every ob|ject
around him &s;eemed to breathe; the light
of the moon trembling among the waving
branches, of which Cele&s;tina had &s;o often re|marked
the effect when they were wandering
together; the &s;imple cadence of ru&s;tic mu&s;ic,
even the happine&s;s which he &s;aw on the coun|tenances
of his ho&s;t and his family, combined
to rai&s;e in his mind regret and languor.&mdash;Never
could he now hope to enjoy &s;uch a
&s;cene with Cele&s;tina; never was he likely to
ta&s;te the delight of being re&s;tored to all he
loved&mdash;Oh, no!&mdash;Cele&s;tina was the wife of
another&mdash;and the world had no happine&s;s for
him.&mdash;As he indulged the&s;e melancholy
thoughts, he &s;at almo&s;t motionle&s;s, and ap|peared
to be attending to the mu&s;ic of Le
Laurier&mdash;but on a &s;udden they quite over|came
him, and &s;triking his hands together,
he &s;tarted up, and walked &s;uddenly away
from the little a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213">
His ho&s;t immediately cea&s;ed to play, and
following him, enquired with unaffected &s;oli|citude,
if he was ill.&mdash;Willoughby immedi|ately
recovering him&s;elf, thanked him for his
kindne&s;s; and a&s;&s;ured him, that his emotion
was occa&s;ioned merely by the &s;ong he had
heard, which had brought &s;ome unplea&s;ing
recollections to his mind.&mdash;The man, in&s;tead
of attempting to con&s;ole him by common|place
&s;peeches, &s;aid, he would then leave him
a moment; and hoped he would &s;oon rejoin
them, and allow them to wi&s;h him a good|night.&mdash;Willoughby
walked on a little far|ther
towards the wood&mdash;he looked up to the
moon&mdash;"Even at this moment," &s;aid he,
"perhaps the eyes of Cele&s;tina are fixed on
thee, mild and beautiful planet.&mdash;Tho&s;e fine
and expre&s;&s;ive eyes, which I have &s;een fill
with tears of admiration and delight, as they
have contemplated the beauty of the univer&s;e,
and the wi&s;dom of its Creator&mdash;Ah, Cele&s;tina!&mdash;our
hearts were made for each other&mdash;but
yours&mdash;yours is perhaps changed, and to me
is lo&s;t as well as your per&s;on."&mdash;he dared not
tru&s;t him&s;elf with this train of thought; but
turning, walked &s;lowly back towards the
<PB N="212" REF="214">
cottage door, where only Le Laurier, and his
Loui&s;on, now waited to &s;hew him to his bed.
As he walked &s;ilently along, the bells of a
convent below &s;eemed to be calling its inha|bitants
to their evening prayers; and from
an higher part of the mountain, which aro&s;e
very &s;uddenly beyond the woods, a &s;mall bell
an&s;wered, and was re-echoed among the rocks.&mdash;On
his reaching Le Laurier, he enquired
what the&s;e &s;ounds meant&mdash;"The bells, be|low,"
&s;aid he," "are tho&s;e of the convent
of St. Benoit, about half a mile below us;
and the &s;maller one is that of Father Antho|ny,
a hermit, who inhabits one of the rocks
above&mdash;he has lived there many years.</P>
<P>"And where is the ca&s;tle of Rochemarte?"
enquired Willoughby.</P>
<P>"It is almo&s;t clo&s;e to the convent," re|plied
Le Laurier&mdash;"and if you wi&s;h to &s;ee
them both I will wait upon you thither to|morrow."</P>
<P>Willoughby now repeated his acknowledg|ments
for the courte&s;y he had received; and
retired to his ru&s;tic bed&mdash;where fatigue, in
de&s;pite of the depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, which his
<PB N="213" REF="215">
la&s;t reverie had brought upon him, gave him
up to repo&s;e; and he, for a while, enjoyed
that
<Q>Sweet forgetfulne&s;s of human care,</Q>
without which the wretched would lo&s;e the
power of enduring their wretchedne&s;s; and
the happy, that of enjoying their good for|tune.</P>

<P>BY the break of day, the following morn|ing,
Willoughby had left his ru&s;tic couch,
and joining his ho&s;t and his family, partook
of their &s;imple meal.&mdash;He felt &s;ome concern,
on reflecting on the panic poor Farnham mu&s;t
have been in, when the guide returned with|out
him to the place of rendezvous, the preced|ing
evening.&mdash;He expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s on
this head to Le Laurier, who &s;aid, he knew
the place de&s;cribed, perfectly; and would im|mediately
&s;end thither the &s;on of a neigh|bouring
&s;hepherd, who was then employed
about his cottage, and bring his &s;ervant and
the guide to him: in the mean time, he pro|po&s;e
to &s;hew Willoughby the chateau of his
ma&s;ter; a propo&s;al which his gue&s;t readily
accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="217">
Loui&s;on, however, on their being about to
depart, had, in her very expre&s;&s;ive face, a
look of concern; and in her manner, an ap|pearance
of inquietude, for which Willoughby
wi&s;hed to account.&mdash;He was not long left in
&s;u&s;pence: &s;he took her hu&s;band's hand, and
&s;aid, "My friend, you will not leave me
long."&mdash;"No, &s;impleton," replied he&mdash;and
then turning to Willoughby, he gaily ex|claimed&mdash;"Here
is a woman, who is afraid of
tru&s;ting her hu&s;band to go half a mile!"</P>
<P>"Ah, Mon&s;ieur,"&mdash;&s;aid Loui&s;on&mdash;"you
would not blame me, if you knew how he
once left me&mdash;he went away only for a few
days, and he &s;taid near three years."</P>
<P>"But not voluntarily, indeed," an&s;wer|ed
Le Laurier&mdash;"I met my ma&s;ter, my
dear ma&s;ter, who had been &s;o kind to me&mdash;in
pri&s;on&mdash;in di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;in a &s;tate of mind bor|dering
on in&s;anity&mdash;and I could not leave
him."</P>
<P>"I do not blame you for that, my friend,"
&s;aid Loui&s;on; "but I own I am afraid of its
happening again."</P>
<P>"How happen again?&mdash;the Chevalier&mdash;
<PB N="216" REF="218">
or rather the Count, my ma&s;ter, is not now
as he was then?"</P>
<P>"Ah, no!&mdash;But you have owned your&s;elf,
that he is re&s;tle&s;s and unhappy; and though
he appears at times delighted with being re|&s;tored
to his liberty, his e&s;tate, and his daugh|ter,
yet, that at times his mind is un&s;ettled, and
his &s;chemes wild and uncertain&mdash;and if he
&s;hould take it into his head to travel again!"</P>
<P>"You fear that I may be tempted to travel
with him."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid his wife&mdash;"indeed I do."&mdash;Le
Laurier then tried to laugh away her appre|hen&s;ions,
and they left her; while Willoughby
felt his dialogue give new force to the curio|&s;ity
he had to &s;ee the Count de Bellegarde.</P>
<P>As their way was down through the woody
&s;ide of the mountain, they &s;oon reached the
domain of the chateau; in which, the fir&s;t
object that &s;truck Willoughby, in a &s;pot which
had once been cleared of trees, but where the
underwood, and a &s;maller growth of wood
again, almo&s;t concealed it, was a pavilion, which
had once been magnificent, but was now in
ruins.&mdash;It was built of various-coloured mar|bles,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
found in the Pyrenees; was of Grecian
architecture, and &s;eemed to have been a work
of ta&s;te. The pillars of the portico, though
broken, yet &s;upported its roof; and behind
it were three apartments, that had once been
richly furni&s;hed: one, as a banqueting room;
the other two as rooms, for the <HI>Sie&s;ta</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sie&s;ta</HI>&mdash;repo&s;ing for an hour or two after dinner, during the extreme heat; as was u&s;ual in Spain, Por|tugal, Italy, and the We&s;t Indies.</NOTE>, which
is u&s;ually taken here as in Spain.&mdash;The cano|pies
of yellow dama&s;k, were fallen, and the
hangings of the rooms devoured by the moths,
and decayed by the damps from the windows;
which, having never been glazed, the &s;hutters
had long &s;ince dropped down.&mdash;There was
&s;omething particularly melancholy to the
mind of Willoughby in contemplating this
building, once the &s;eat of gaiety, &s;plendour,
and luxurious repo&s;e, thus de&s;erted&mdash;and he
enquired of Le Laurier, if the pre&s;ent Count
never intended to repair it.&mdash;"Sir," replied
he, "My Lord, the Count, has hardly had
time to think about that yet; for he has been
&s;o little a while at his ca&s;tle, that every thing
<PB N="218" REF="220">
there remains as it was&mdash;ruinous enough.&mdash;But,
as for this pavilion, I que&s;tion if ever it
will be put in order, though my lord has
&s;uch an odd &s;ort of a liking to it, that the mo|ment
almo&s;t he got home, he came down to
look at it.&mdash;It was quite late in the evening;
but it was not dark&mdash;and he looked in at the
window, for that night I could not open the
door&mdash;the key was lo&s;t&mdash;and the locks were
all ru&s;ty&mdash;and by what he &s;aid, I am &s;ure there
is &s;ome &s;tory belongs to this place.&mdash;The peo|ple
of the ca&s;tle, indeed, always had a notion
of its being haunted ever &s;ince the death of my
lord's &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e heart, they &s;ay, was broke by
her father's ill u&s;age.&mdash;Certain it is, that the
old Count cau&s;ed this place to be &s;hut up,
and took away the fine gla&s;&s;es and pictures
that were in it once&mdash;but what you fee now
he left to fall to pieces.&mdash;There u&s;ed to be
large trees all around it; and all manner of
flowers; and the &s;tream, that now almo&s;t &s;tag|nates
among tho&s;e reeds and ru&s;hes, and with
difficulty finds its way to the moat of the
ca&s;tle, was then brought into a bath, behind
the banqueting-hou&s;e, and. into a ba&s;on,
<PB N="219" REF="221">
which is now grown over with weeds and
gra&s;s, &s;o that it can hardly be traced.</P>
<P>Willoughby left this de&s;olate &s;pot with a
&s;igh, and as his companion led him through
the ob&s;cure paths of the woods that &s;urround|ed
it, he enquired whether the ca&s;tle it&s;elf had
equally &s;uffered from time.&mdash;"Oh, yes, Sir,'
replied Le Laurier, "from time; and from
war, too.&mdash;It was formerly a place of great
&s;trength, and of great importance, as a pa&s;s
into France, from the Spani&s;h &s;ide of the
the Pyrenees; and held out a long &s;iege
when the famous Count of Bellegarde, my
lord's ance&s;tor, defended it for Henry the
Fourth, <HI>our</HI> king; again&s;t the army of the
League."&mdash;"Perhaps," &s;aid Willoughby,
"your Lord may not like the intru&s;ion of a
&s;tranger into his retirement?"&mdash;"Oh," re|plied
his conductor, "we may not happen
to meet him; or, if we &s;hould, it will be a
&s;ufficient introduction and recommendation,
for you, Sir, that you are an Engli&s;hman, for
he loves the Engli&s;h."</P>
<P>Encouraged by this a&s;&s;urance, Willoughby
proceeded, and in a few moments, the woods
a&s;cending a little, as they reached the extreme
<PB N="220" REF="222">
ba&s;e of the mountain, opened into what could
only be called a plain, when oppo&s;ed to the
&s;urrounding hills, for the ground was rugged
and uneven, &s;cattered with ma&s;&s;es of ruined
buildings, that had formerly been part of the
outward fortifications; but of which &s;ome
were fallen into the fo&s;&s;e, and others over|grown
with alder, a&s;h, and arbeal. The gate
of the ca&s;tle, and all beyond the moat, how|ever,
was yet entire, as were the walls within its
circumference, bearing every where the marks
of great antiquity, but of &s;uch ponderous
&s;trength, as time alone had not been able to
de&s;troy.&mdash;Where breaches had been made by
cannon, the walls had been repaired; but
this work being of le&s;s durability than the
original &s;tructure, had gone to decay; and
the depredations of war were &s;till very vi&s;ible.
The whole was compo&s;ed of grey &s;tone; the
towers, at each end, ro&s;e in frowning, gran|deur,
above the re&s;t of the building; and
having only loops, and no windows, impre&s;&s;|ed
ideas of darkne&s;s and impri&s;onment, while
the mo&s;s and wall-flowers filled the inter&s;tices
of the broken &s;tones; and an infinite number
of birds, made their ne&s;ts among the &s;hat|tered
<PB N="221" REF="223">
cornices, and half-fallen battlements,
filling the air with their &s;hrill cries.</P>
<P>Over the moat, which was broad and deep,
but now only half-full of water, which was
almo&s;t hidden by aquatic plants, &s;heltering
&s;everal &s;orts of water-fowls, that now lived
there unmole&s;ted; a draw-bridge, with ma&s;|&s;ive
chains, led to the gate of the fir&s;t court,
under an high arched gate-way, defended
by a double port-cullis: this court was where
the ca&s;tle guard were, u&s;ed to parade&mdash;It was
&s;pacious, and the buildings that &s;urrounded
it were gloomily magnificent; but now, no
warlike foot&s;teps wore away the gra&s;s which
grew over the pavement; no martial mu&s;ic
echoed among the arches and colonades&mdash;one
&s;olitary figure alone, appeared &s;lowly walking
with his arms cro&s;&s;ed, on the terrace that led
to the &s;econd court.&mdash;"There is my Lord, the
Count," &s;aid Le Laurier&mdash;"Speak to him,
then," replied Willoughby, "and apologize
for my intru&s;ion." Le Laurier advanced,
with his hat in his hand, and at the &s;ame mo|ment,
the Count, who then fir&s;t perceived him
and Willoughby, came towards them.&mdash;His
<PB N="222" REF="224">
military air, and dignified figure, were tem|pered
by the mild and courteous manner with
which he moved forward to receive the
&s;tranger whom Le Laurier announced to him.
He was greatly above the common height,
thin, and a little bent, as if from depre&s;&s;ion
of &s;pirit&mdash;but his face pale, &s;allow, and ema|ciated,
as it was, was marked with &s;uch pe|culiar
expre&s;&s;ion, that all the adventures of
his life &s;eemed to have been written there.&mdash;When
he &s;poke, his dark eyes were full of
fire and vivacity, yet at times they were wild;
and at others, heavy and glazed&mdash;his brows
were a little contracted, and hollowne&s;s about
his temples and cheeks, and the &s;trong mu&s;|cular
lines of his whole face, &s;eemed to bear
the har&s;h impre&s;&s;ions of the hand of adver&s;ity,
rather than of time: for though his hair was
grey, and he looked much older than he really
was, Willoughby did hot think him above
four or five-and-forty: at his brea&s;t was the
cro&s;s of the order of St. E&s;prit; and his dre&s;s,
that of a captain of cavalry, was not modern,
and apparently neglected&mdash;his whole appear|ance
in&s;tantly announced him to be a man of high rank.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225">
If Willoughby was plea&s;ed with his man|ner
and addre&s;s, he &s;eemed equally, or even
more gratified by the curio&s;ity expre&s;&s;ed by
an Engli&s;hman, to vi&s;it him. "You &s;ee me
here, Sir," &s;aid he, "relea&s;ed only a few
weeks ago from a long impri&s;onment, won|dering
at my freedom, and a &s;tranger in my
own hou&s;e. To tho&s;e only, who have been
the victims of de&s;poti&s;m, it would be ea&s;y to
comprehend my &s;en&s;ations on &s;uch a &s;udden
emancipation; and the triumph with which
I reflect that I owe it to the &s;ame noble efforts
which have given liberty to France&mdash;to my
country."</P>
<P>"Ah!" continued he, pau&s;ing&mdash;and lo&s;ing
at once all the vivacity with which he had, a
moment before, &s;poken&mdash;"ah! what &s;en&s;a|tions
of concern are mingled with this exulta|tion&mdash;I
regain my freedom&mdash;but where &s;hall
I regain my happine&s;s?"</P>
<P>He now fell into a deep mu&s;ing, which
la&s;ted only a moment&mdash;while Willoughby
walked by his &s;ide, on the terrace&mdash;then &s;ud|denly
awaking from it, he cried&mdash;"But it is
too &s;oon to trouble you with this &s;ort of con|ver&s;ation&mdash;we
&s;hall have time enough&mdash;for I
<PB N="224" REF="226">
flatter my&s;elf, Sir, with a hope of your &s;tay|ing
with me, as long as you remain in this
country&mdash;you mu&s;t have no other home.&mdash;If
you knew the plea&s;ure I have in conver&s;ing
with the Engli&s;h!"&mdash;he pau&s;ed again, as if
forgetting what he meant to &s;ay&mdash;and then
added&mdash;"I will introduce you to my daugh|ter&mdash;to
my little Anzoletta&mdash;for I have &s;aved
her&mdash;that one little gem is re&s;tored to me in
all its lu&s;tre, amid the wreck of every thing
el&s;e that was dear to me&mdash;we will find her
now." He then entered through another
arched way, the &s;econd court of the ca&s;tle,
and Willoughby accompanied him in &s;ilence,
while Le Laurier, with his hat in his hand,
followed, as the Count bade him.</P>
<P>They entered an immen&s;e hall; barbarou&s;ly
magnificent; it was roofed with beams of oak,
and the &s;ides covered with &s;tandards, and tro|phies
of armour, the peri&s;hable parts of which
were dropping to pieces.&mdash;The narrow Go|thic
windows were filled, not with gla&s;s, that
admitted the light, but with gla&s;s, painted
with the atchievements of the family; mingled
with the heads of &s;aints and martyrs, who&s;e
names were now, no where to be found, but
<PB N="225" REF="227">
in the archives of the neighbouring convent.
But, in contemplating the innumerable coats
of arms that were blazoned on the windows,
and on the banner that hung in faded maje&s;|ty,
between them, Willoughby could not
help recollecting what food they would afford
for the favourite &s;peculations of his uncle&mdash;and
his thoughts dwelt a moment on the
&s;cene that might have pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence
of his ab&s;ence, in the family of Ca&s;tle|north.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections, however, he had neither
inclination nor time to indulge&mdash;for the Count
a&s;cending a broad, but &s;teep &s;tair-ca&s;e of &s;tone,
that led out of the hall, and wound within
one of the turrets, entered a gallery, and at
the end of it was his daughter's apartment,
the door of which was open, and Willoughby
was immediately introduced to a young per|&s;on,
who &s;at before a frame, working on a
piece of embroidery: a woman between fifty
and &s;ixty, who &s;eemed to be a kind of go|verne&s;s,
was with her.</P>
<P>Willoughby was plea&s;ed by the graceful
&s;implicity of her figure, and the beauty of
<PB N="226" REF="228">
her face&mdash;but when &s;he &s;poke, in an&s;wer to
the compliment he made her, this plea&s;ure
was converted into amazement&mdash;he fancied
he heard the voice of Cele&s;tina!</P>
<P>So &s;trikingly did its tones re&s;emble tho&s;e to
which his heart had been always tremblingly
re&s;pon&s;ive, that had he not &s;een who &s;poke,
he &s;hould not have doubted of its being Ce|le&s;tina
her&s;elf.&mdash;He &s;tarted&mdash;and felt the
blood ru&s;h into his cheeks&mdash;nor could he im|mediately
recollect him&s;elf enough to reply to
what Anzoletta &s;aid; and again call forth
tho&s;e &s;ounds, to which, the &s;econd time &s;he
&s;poke, he li&s;tened with increa&s;ed a&s;toni&s;hment
and more painful delight; for, not only the
&s;imilarity of her voice, to that of Cele&s;tina,
was more evident, but he &s;aw a re&s;emblance
to her in the air and manner of Anzoletta,
that a&s;&s;i&s;ted the delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Anzoletta &s;eemed to be about the age of
Cele&s;tina, but her figure was le&s;s: her hair
and eyes were much darker, nor had &s;he that
dazzling and radiant complexion which made
it always difficult to believe of Cele&s;tina, that
&s;he was a native of the South of Europe&mdash;the
features of Anzoletta were, perhaps, more
<PB N="227" REF="229">
regular, and were not turned like Cele&s;tina&mdash;&s;o
that the re&s;emblance con&s;i&s;ted in that &s;ort
of air of family, which we &s;ometimes ob&s;erve
among relations&mdash;a kind of flying likene&s;s,
which we now detect, and now lo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Count &s;eemed highly gratified by the
notice Willoughby took of his daughter&mdash;to
whom he now &s;poke, and bade her prepare
her&s;elf for dinner, for that his gue&s;t was to
remain with them&mdash;He then led Willoughby
back to the room where he u&s;ually &s;at him|&s;elf;
and as they went, he &s;aid&mdash;"Is not my
Anzoletta charming?"&mdash;"She is indeed," re|plied
Willoughby.&mdash;"Perhaps," added the
Count, "perhaps you would not believe that
&s;he is the child of the daughter of a man of
inferior rank, one of my father's va&s;&s;als."&mdash;"Is
&s;he not <HI>your</HI> daughter, my Lord?" en|quired
Willoughby.&mdash;"Yes," replied the
Count, "&s;he is my legitimate daughter; and
as &s;uch, I glory to acknowledge her&mdash;but
her mother was <HI>rolurier</HI>&mdash;and, to my marrying
her, &s;he owed all her misfortunes; and I,
many of mine.&mdash;But if ever you think it
worth while to hear the incidents of a life,
<PB N="228" REF="230">
that has, I think, been marked with &s;ome
&s;ingular occurrences, I &s;hall have a melan|choly
plea&s;ure in relating them.</P>
<P>"Nothing would oblige me &s;o much,"
&s;aid Willoughby, who&s;e curio&s;ity had been
every in&s;tant increa&s;ing&mdash;e&s;pecially &s;ince he
had &s;een Anzoletta.&mdash;"May I, till I can be
&s;o gratified, enquire where is the mother of
your lovely daughter?" "Yes," replied the
Count; "and you will hear a fre&s;h in&s;tance
of the barbarous policy which de&s;poti&s;m en|courages
and protects. Her mother! &s;he was
compelled by my father, the la&s;t Count of
Bellegarde, to enter into a convent of Carme|lites,
at Bayonne, and there to take the vows.
She was my wife, by the laws of God and
man&mdash;but I was ab&s;ent with my regiment&mdash;I
was unable to protect her&mdash;and the power of
the governor of the province, and of an en|raged
and tyrannic father, were united to tear
her from me.&mdash;Would to heaven, we had been
theonly victims&mdash;but there was yet another!&mdash;another,
who is gone whence there is no re|turn."&mdash;Here
he &s;ell into one of tho&s;e fits
of &s;ilent mu&s;ing, to which Willoughby had
<PB N="229" REF="231">
even during their &s;hort acquaintance, ob&s;erv|ed
him to be &s;ubject.&mdash;It la&s;ted, however,
only a moment, and then recovering from it,
he cla&s;ped his hands eagerly together, and
cried, with energy&mdash;"But, for my wife&mdash;my
Jaquelina&mdash;Thanks to the generous, the glo|rious
&s;pirit of my country&mdash;I &s;hall retrieve
her&mdash;&s;he yet lives&mdash;I have &s;een her through
the iron bars of her cloi&s;ter&mdash;I have &s;poke to
her!&mdash;I have, in my bo&s;om, a handkerchief
which &s;he gave me, bathed in her tears!&mdash;She
told me where to find our child&mdash;our
little Anzoletta&mdash;and I go to Paris to demand
and obtain her liberty: to claim her as my wife,
and to be enabled to bring her hither, to a
hu&s;band, who, changed as &s;he is, by con&s;ine|ment,
and affliction, &s;till adores her&mdash;to a
daughter, who&s;e early excellence promi&s;es to
reward us both for many, many years of &s;e|paration
and &s;orrow."</P>
<P>The eyes of the Count were filled with
tears, as he cea&s;ed &s;peaking; and Willoughby,&mdash;who&s;e
heart was as tender as it was manly,
was deeply affected.&mdash;"Heaven grant you all
your wi&s;hes, Sir!" cried he&mdash;"and that
<PB N="230" REF="232">
your private happine&s;s may be one of the in|numerable
ble&s;&s;ings attending on public feli|city."&mdash;The
Count wrung his hands&mdash;and
cried, with yet increa&s;ed vivacity, "It will&mdash;it
will, my friend!"&mdash;There, was in his man|ner
a &s;omething bordering on wildne&s;s, as
he continued this di&s;cour&s;e, which Willough|by
remarked with &s;ome concern&mdash;he was not,
therefore, &s;orry, when it was interrupted by
the entrance of Le Laurier, who told him,
that the me&s;&s;enger he had di&s;patched, had
found his &s;ervant and the guide; and, reliev|ing
them from their fears, for his &s;afety,
which had been cruelly &s;evere upon poor
Farnham, had brought them both to the
ca&s;tle, whither his wife had directed them.</P>
<P>Willoughby had been under a good deal
of concern for Farnham, who, he knew, mu&s;t
have been dreadfully alarmed for the &s;afety
of his ma&s;ter; his arrival, therefore, was
particularly welcome, and he was glad to
change his clothes; for which purpo&s;e, he
now begged leave to retire&mdash;The Count or|dered
Le Laurier to &s;hew them to an apart|ment,
and to take care he had every accom|modation
<PB N="231" REF="233">
he de&s;ired.&mdash;Willoughby, as he
marched gravely along, through the long gal|leries,
and acro&s;s the gloomy hall, fancied him|&s;elf
a knight of romance; and, that &s;ome of
the &s;tories of enchanted ca&s;tles, and wandering
adventurers, of which he had been &s;o fond,
in his early youth, were here realized.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a repa&s;t, rather ho&s;pitable than
&s;plendid, during which the looks of paternal
admiration, and tenderne&s;s with which the
Count ob&s;erved every action of Anzoletta,
and her innocent and agreeable vivacity, ren|dered
them both more attractive to Willough|by:
Mon&s;ieur de Bellegarde, finding that
Willoughby rather wi&s;hed to li&s;ten to the
hi&s;tory he had promi&s;ed, than to take any
repo&s;e, during the heat of the day, propo&s;ed
retiring to the north gallery, and there begin|ning
this intere&s;ting account. Willoughby
mo&s;t readily agreed to the plan&mdash;and the
Count, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his daughter and her go|verne&s;s,
led him hither.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235">
This room extended far on the north &s;ide
of the building&mdash;and looked over the moat to
a wood of fir and cypre&s;s, fringing the abrupt
a&s;cent of the mountain, which ro&s;e almo&s;t
perpendicularly from the. plain. As this ac|clivity
commanded the ca&s;tle, two &s;trong re|doubts
were built on it, where, in ho&s;tile
times, parties were &s;tationed to keep the ene|my
from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing po&s;ts, whence the ca&s;tle
might be annoyed. In the port-holes of the&s;e
fortre&s;&s;es, now fa&s;t approaching to decay,
the cannon yet remained, though ru&s;ty and
u&s;ele&s;s&mdash;and the &s;trong but tre&s;&s;es, and circular
towers, mantled with ivy, were &s;een to a&s;pire
above the dark trees, on every &s;ide encom|pa&s;&s;ing
them&mdash;while, a little to the we&s;t, from
a fractured rock, of yellow granite, which
&s;tarted out amid the trees, a, boiling and ra|pid
&s;tream ru&s;hed with violence, and pouring
down among the trees, was &s;een only at in|tervals,
as they either crowded over it, or, re|ceding,
left its foaming current to fla&s;h in the
&s;ays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>It was altogether one of the mo&s;t &s;ublimely
beautiful land&s;capes Willoughby had ever
<PB N="234" REF="236">
&s;een; and he contemplated the &s;cenery with
pen&s;ive plea&s;ure, while the ma&s;ter of it thus
addre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P>Perhaps you are &s;o well read in the hi&s;tory
of France, as to make it unnece&s;&s;ary for me
to remark&mdash;that my family is ancient and il|lu&s;trious.&mdash;My
father, the Count of Belle|garde,
was educated with every prejudice that
could make him tenacious of his rank, and
anxious to &s;upport it.&mdash;He was married early
by my grandfather to the heire&s;s of the hou&s;e
of Ermenonville; and his elde&s;t &s;on, the
only i&s;&s;ue of that marriage, inherited from his
mother the great property of that family.</P>
<P>But ambition, which my father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
a great &s;hare, both from his temper and his
education, &s;aved him not entirely from the in|fluence
of &s;o&s;ter pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;During the life of
his fir&s;t wife, an indigent relation of his own,
was received into the family of one of his
&s;i&s;ters, as a dependant&mdash;&s;he was beautiful and
intere&s;ting, and my father being relea&s;ed, by
death, from an engagement, in which his
heart had never any &s;hare, married her&mdash;and
<PB N="235" REF="237">
thought him&s;elf overpaid, by the felicity of
his &s;econd marriage, for the little &s;atisfaction
he had found in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But though he had in one in&s;tance, &s;uffered
his inclinations to conquer that a&s;piring tem|per,
which, under le&s;s-powerful influence,
would have led him to &s;eek for a &s;econd great
heire&s;s, he &s;eemed determined to apply him|&s;elf
with more a&s;&s;iduity to the attainment of
power and honour, by other means&mdash;He had
&s;ome capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s; was daring in
forming &s;chemes, and ob&s;tinate in adhering to
them&mdash;proud, vindictive, and violent; with
&s;uch a portion of national pride, as made him
hold every other nation but his own in the
utmo&s;t contempt&mdash;and, whenever they &s;eemed
likely to di&s;pute the &s;uperiority of France, he
was tempted to wi&s;h, like Caligula, that the
people &s;o pre&s;umptuous, had but one neck,
than he might de&s;troy them at a blow.</P>
<P>With this di&s;po&s;ition, you will ea&s;ily ima|gine,
the inveteracy with which he regarded
the Engli&s;h.&mdash;He held a high po&s;t in the
war-department of France, in 1755, when
tho&s;e ho&s;tilities commenced, in which, for a
&s;eries of years, the Engli&s;h had almo&s;t always
<PB N="236" REF="238">
the advantage&mdash;events that added to national
hatred, or a kind of per&s;onal and peculiar
malignity&mdash;for of many of the operations in
which his country failed of &s;ucce&s;s, the Count
of Bellegarde was the projector.</P>
<P>By a long cour&s;e of defeat, however, his
ma&s;ter, Louis the Fifteenth, and his co-adju|tors,
grew weary of his influence; and, in
1759, after the lo&s;s of Quebec, he was &s;ud|denly
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Nor was this mortification the only one he
was at that period fated to &s;u&s;tain.&mdash;A violent
and infectious fever at the &s;ame time deprived
him of his wife&mdash;and, wounded thus deeply,
by public and dome&s;tic misfortune, he took
the &s;udden re&s;olution of quitting the world,
and retiring to this ca&s;tle, with my brother,
my &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hither, then, he came&mdash;leaving, at Paris,
his elde&s;t &s;on, who had been &s;ome time in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mother's fortune, and had
lived entirely independent of. his father, and
on no very friendly terms with him. To
the young, gay, and di&s;&s;ipated D'Ermenon|ville
(for he took the name of his mother)
the au&s;terity of a &s;tate&s;man, and conver&s;ation
<PB N="237" REF="239">
of a politician, were alike repul&s;ive; and he
had no feelings about him that di&s;po&s;ed him
to &s;ubmit to the authority of a parent, from
whom he had nothing to expect&mdash;for it was
well under&s;tood, that of all the Count de
Bellegarde either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed from his ance&s;tors,
or acquired from his political advantages,
D'Ermenonville would inherit only that &s;hare
which, by its being entailed, his father could
not deprive him.</P>
<P>The error of which the Count thought he
had been guilty, in allowing to this elde&s;t
&s;on early independence, and boundle&s;s ex|pence,
made him determine to adopt, in re|gard
to me and my brother, a conduct alto|gether
contrary.&mdash;On his retirement from the
world, my brother, who was the elde&s;t of the
two, and called the Baron de Rochemarte,
was near fifteen, and I was only fourteen
months younger&mdash;yet, though at that age,
we &s;hould have been either pur&s;uing our
&s;tudies, or with the army, in which we had
both commi&s;&s;ions, my father took us away
with him: and, with a governor whom he en|gaged,
becau&s;e he was the mo&s;t rigid pedant he
could find, he fixed us both in what we then
<PB N="238" REF="240">
thought the de&s;olate &s;olitude of Rochemarte&mdash;a
place which he had fixed upon for his
own re&s;idence; not only becau&s;e it was &s;o far
from the &s;cene of his former elevation; but
becau&s;e it was the only one of his capital
hou&s;es that was not entailed on D'Ermenon|ville.!</P>
<P>The gloomy &s;olitude in which he lived&mdash;the
power of life and death which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in his domain, and the pronene&s;s of his mind
to &s;uper&s;tition, which was encouraged by the
Monks of the neighbouring convent, who
&s;oon. found the advantage of having &s;o liberal
a benefactor&mdash;at once darkened and &s;oured a
temper, never very good. Accu&s;tomed to dic|tate
and command, he could not now dive&s;t
him&s;elf of the habit: and his va&s;&s;als, and his
&s;ons, being the only per&s;ons over whom
he could now exert it, were the victims of
his har&s;h and imperious &s;pirit&mdash;for in them
he delighted to di&s;cover, or to fancy faults,
only for the &s;atisfaction of impo&s;ing puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily imagined, that to two lads
of our ages, and who had from temper and
con&s;titution a keen reli&s;h for plea&s;ures of
<PB N="239" REF="241">
every kind, the life we led was in&s;upportable.
The mild and &s;oft-tempered Genevieve, our
&s;i&s;ter, who was then not more than twelve
years old, though from her &s;ex and di&s;po&s;i|tion,
more accu&s;tomed to, and able to endure
&s;olitude and confinement, began to feel the
weight of tho&s;e chains, of which, however,
&s;he did not complain; but endeavoured, by
her &s;oothing &s;weetne&s;s, to make ours &s;it more
ea&s;y.&mdash;She was my father's favourite, and her
influence had, for &s;ome time, the power to
a&s;&s;uage the har&s;hne&s;s of his temper&mdash;but, by
degrees, even that failed of its effect, and
his mortified pride, his lo&s;t happine&s;s, and
his gloomy notions of religion, combined to
increa&s;e this ferocity, and irritate his a&s;perity,
till, at length, his children, though the chil|dren
of a woman he &s;o fondly loved, &s;eemed
to afford him nothing but objects of anger
and tyranny, and he was left alone to the
influence of Father Ignatius, a Je&s;uit, whom
he took into his hou&s;e as the director of his
con&s;cience; and who&s;e purpo&s;e, it &s;eemed to
be, to e&s;trange him from his family en|tirely.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242">
There is a point, beyond which, the en|durance
of the mo&s;t patient &s;ufferer, cannot
go&mdash;Genevieve, indeed, Was not yet arrived
at this point, but the Baron and I had long
&s;ince pa&s;&s;ed it, and determined to break the
&s;etters, which, in their pre&s;ent form, we did
not think even paternal authority had a right
to impo&s;e. The Baron, therefore, wrote to
D'Ermenonville, repre&s;enting our &s;ituation,
and entreating his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to deliver us
from it.</P>
<P>The Marquis D'Ermenonville had, per|haps,
no great affection for us; he could not
be totally indifferent to the repre&s;entation of
the Baron; and felt, perhaps, &s;ome plea&s;ure,
in being able to thwart his father, where it
&s;eemed to be a &s;ort of duty to act in oppo&s;i|tion
to him. For this purpo&s;e, he immedi|ately,
and by a way which we had pointed
out to him, &s;ent us a con&s;iderable &s;upply of
money, and directed us both to quit the ca&s;tle
in the night, and find our way to Perpignan,
where his &s;ervant and hor&s;es &s;hould attend to
conduct us to Paris.&mdash;He urged, not only the
cruelty the Count de Bellegarde was guitly of,
<PB N="241" REF="243">
in thus obliging us to wa&s;te the be&s;t of our days
in a de&s;art; but the appearance it mu&s;t have
to the world, that when a war was carrying
on, two young men, enli&s;ted in their coun|try's
&s;ervice, &s;ubmitted to be confined, like
monks, in a cloi&s;ter.&mdash;This remark would
have been enough to have fired us with am|bition
and military ardor; but to the incite|ments
of honour, he added the allurements of
plea&s;ure&mdash;and every &s;cruple that remained
(for I had &s;till &s;ome as to leaving my father
without his permi&s;&s;ion) gave way before their
united influence.</P>
<P>I could not, however, with equal &s;ucce&s;s,
conquer the regret I felt at leaving my be|loved
Genevieve, to whom, from our earlie&s;t
infancy, I had been particularly attached.&mdash;She
would, we were well a&s;&s;ured, be com|pelled
to encounter all the fury and indigna|tion
of the Count, when our departure &s;hould
be known; and when we &s;aw her trem|ble
with the mere apprehen&s;ion of it, we
would very fain have obviated every difficulty
that &s;eemed. to forbid our taking her with us:
but, child as &s;he was, &s;he an&s;wered with firm|ne&s;s
and re&s;olution, of which her gentle tem|per
<PB N="242" REF="244">
&s;eemed little capable; "No, my dear
brothers," &s;aid &s;he, "it is fit you &s;hould
go&mdash;but that I &s;hould &s;tay&mdash;no point of ho|nour,
no military duty calls me; and I will
not de&s;ert my father&mdash;he is unhappy&mdash;and
has need of me&mdash;he mu&s;t not be depriv|ed
at once of all his children&mdash;and, if he
treats me with rigour, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
not having de&s;erved it, will enable me to &s;u&s;|tain
it with patience."</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that &s;he &s;hould
appear wholly ignorant of our flight&mdash;and
we dreaded that her re&s;olution would give
way, when &s;he was charged with having been
acquainted with it; in&s;omuch, that we &s;hould
now have repented having made her a party
in our &s;ecret, could we have borne the
thoughts of leaving, abruptly and unkindly,
a &s;i&s;ter, whom we both &s;o fondly loved.</P>
<P>At length, the hour came for this cruel
parting.&mdash;My father, who &s;ince his re&s;idence
here, had affected all the &s;tate of a feudal ba|ron,
and even many of the precautions of a
be&s;ieged chief, though he had no enemies to
apprehend, but the wolves and bears of the
Pyrenees; not only had the draw-bridge
<PB N="243" REF="245">
taken up every night, but had a &s;ort of guard
parade, at &s;tated hours, the courts of the
ca&s;tle. Our de&s;ire of liberty, however, &s;ur|mounted
all the difficulties by which our
e&s;cape &s;eemed to be impeded; and, by means
of our &s;i&s;ter, and our own re&s;olution, we de|&s;cended
in &s;afety, from one of the lower win|dows;
cro&s;&s;ed the moat, which was then full,
in our drawers, by &s;wimming, and dre&s;&s;ing
our&s;elves on the oppo&s;ite bank, we proceeded
on foot to Perpignan; and with hearts ex|ulting
in our &s;ucce&s;s, and the joy it gave
us, allayed only by our apprehen&s;ions for
Genevieve.</P>
<P>Our tutor had taken a fancy to wine, and
we took care liberally to &s;upply him&mdash;in con|&s;equence
of which, and of the increa&s;e of
plea&s;ure he found, from this ea&s;y indulgence
of his favourite pa&s;&s;ion, he had in&s;en&s;ibly
abated of his former &s;trictne&s;s; &s;uffered us
every evening to go to the apartment of Ge|nevieve;
and frequently took, in our ab&s;ence,
&s;uch plentiful potations, that he was in bed,
and a&s;leep, before we returned to our apart|ments,
which were within his. Thus, we
<PB N="244" REF="246">
were not mi&s;&s;ed till the morning; and, as we
left no traces on our way, and had not even
entru&s;ted a &s;ervant with our &s;ecret, the pur|&s;uit
that was then made for us, was quite in|effectual.
We arrived &s;afely at Perpignan;
in &s;pirits too elevated to be affected with the
fatigue of our long walk.&mdash;We found that
D'Ermenonville had punctually adhered to
his promi&s;e; and, on his hor&s;es, and attend|ed
by his &s;ervants, we proceeded gaily to
Paris.</P>
<P>D'Ermenonville received us with more cor|dial
friend&s;hip than I believed to be in his na|ture&mdash;he
furni&s;hed us with money to equip
us for joining our re&s;pective regiments, as
became the &s;ons of the Count of Bellegarde&mdash;and
a&s;&s;ured us of his continued a&s;&s;i&s;tance, till
my father could be brought to rea&s;on&mdash;it is
not, therefore, wonderful, that his friend&s;hips
made us blind to his faults; and, that we &s;aw
not the di&s;&s;olute libertine, in the kind and
generous brother.&mdash;In fact, he had many
virtues; and it was to him we owed our &s;up|port
after the peace of 1763 re&s;tored us to the
plea&s;ures of Paris. Then, however, the Count
of Bellegarde, though he re&s;i&s;ted every argu|ment
<PB N="245" REF="247">
which could be brought by the other
parts of our family, to induce him to receive,
and forgive us; yet was &s;o far aver&s;e to our
owing any farther obligation to D'Ermenon|ville,
whom he held in abhorrence, and no
longer acknowledged as his &s;on, that he
agreed to make us each an hand&s;ome allow|ance.</P>
<P>Peace being made, my brother, the Baron
de Rochemarte, went into Germany, where,
during the war, he had formed &s;ome attach|ments;
and I was for &s;everal years in gar|ri&s;on
with my regiment, hearing nothing of
my family but what I learned from the let|ters
my &s;i&s;ter contrived, by &s;tealth, to &s;end
me. After our elopement, &s;he had been, for
&s;ome years, more rigorou&s;ly con&s;ined&mdash;and
had &s;uffered inconceivable har&s;hne&s;s and cruel|ty
from her father&mdash;but at the end of &s;ix
years, though his temper was far from being
&s;oftened by age, the death of the Je&s;uit, who
had been his confe&s;&s;or, &s;eemed to have pro|cured
&s;ome little alleviation to her &s;ufferings.
A younger, and le&s;s-au&s;tere director, of the
&s;ame order, had &s;ucceeded to the government
of his con&s;cience; and Genevieve now in|formed
<PB N="246" REF="248">
me that, accu&s;tomed as &s;he had been,
almo&s;t from her infancy, to confinement, the
moderate &s;everity of that in which &s;he now
lived, was comparatively ea&s;y to her&mdash;that
her father admitted of her &s;ervices with more
plea&s;ure than he u&s;ed to do; &s;poke to her with
greater kindne&s;s; &s;ometimes allowed her to
walk out, and had promi&s;ed that the daugh|ter
of one of his va&s;&s;als, for whom &s;he had
conceived a friend&s;hip, &s;hould be allowed to
re&s;ide with her at the ca&s;tle, as her compa|nion:
&s;he always added her vexation, that this
execution of his promi&s;e was, &s;he knew not
why, always delayed from time to time;
though her old governe&s;s was become quite
u&s;ele&s;s as a companion&mdash;but her greate&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s
&s;eemed to ari&s;e from our long, and
as &s;he began to fear, endle&s;s &s;eparation.</P>
<P>This regret &s;he repeatedly dwelt upon, with
&s;o much pathetic tenderne&s;s, that I at length
determined to go in &s;ecret, and in di&s;gui&s;e, to
Rochemarte, and embrace once more, this
beloved &s;i&s;ter; for whom, long as we had
been parted, I &s;till felt the warme&s;t af|fection.&mdash;I
was at Paris when I made this re|&s;olution,
where, a &s;hort time before, I had
<PB N="247" REF="249">
formed an intimate acquaintance with a young
Engli&s;hman, the &s;econd &s;on of a nobleman&mdash;he
was two or three years younger than I was;
in per&s;on, remarkably hand&s;ome; and in man|ners,
the mo&s;t engaging man I ever met with.&mdash;Our
acquaintance &s;oon became the &s;incere&s;t
friend&s;hip&mdash;and as he communicated to me
every intere&s;ting circum&s;tance that be&s;el him&mdash;&s;o
my &s;ituation in regard to my father, and
my increa&s;ing de&s;ire to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter, were no
&s;ecrets to him.&mdash;He entered into all my &s;oli|citude,
and encouraged me to indulge the in|clination
I had to vi&s;it Rochemarte in di&s;|gui&s;e,
for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Genevieve.</P>
<P>A letter I at that period received from her,
determined me, to he&s;itate no longer.&mdash;She
intimated, that her &s;ituation was become ex|tremely
unplea&s;ant, from the extraordinary
behaviour of the Spani&s;h Je&s;uit, who had
&s;ucceeded old Ignatius&mdash;that this man &s;eemed
to have de&s;igns of the mo&s;t improper nature,
in regard to her; and, that it was he, who
had hitherto oppo&s;ed her having Jacquelina,
the young per&s;on to whom &s;he was attached,
with her; becau&s;e he fore&s;aw, he &s;hould then
have le&s;s frequent opportunities of entertain|ing
<PB N="248" REF="250">
her alone: finding, however, the Count
di&s;po&s;ed to indulge her, and being unable to
form any longer pretences to prevent it, he
had at la&s;t told her, that he would immediate|ly
influence the Count to oblige her, if &s;he
would con&s;ent to a&s;k for the addition of an|other
member to the family, and receive, as
if at her own de&s;ire, a &s;i&s;ter of his, who mu&s;t
be a &s;uperintendant over both her and her
friend, and replace the &s;uperannuated go|verne&s;s,
who was no longer capable of her
charge.&mdash;To this, my poor Genevieve told
me &s;he had con&s;ented, rather than not have
the company of Jacquelina, to cheer her &s;oli|tude&mdash;that
Jacquelina was con&s;equently ar|rived,
and the other expected every day&mdash;but
that, notwith&s;tanding &s;he now had a com|panion,
the Je&s;uit continued to find but too
many opportunities to entertain her with
conver&s;ation which &s;he could not mi&s;under|&s;tand.</P>
<P>My blood boiled with indignation, while I
read this letter, and I in&s;tantly communicated
the contents of it to my friend, Ormond.&mdash;"It
is not po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid he, "that you can
he&s;itate, my dear Chevalier, how to act&mdash;let us
<PB N="249" REF="251">
&s;et out in&s;tantly for Rochemarte&mdash;you &s;ee a
friend ready, not only to attend you, but to
lo&s;e his life in your &s;ervice." We departed
the next day, followed only by two &s;ervants,
and arriving at Perpignan, began to con&s;ult
on the means of meeting Genevieve, without
the knowledge of my father, or the inhabi|tants
of the ca&s;tle&mdash;and the propere&s;t expedi|ent
that occurred to us was, to di&s;gui&s;e our|&s;elves
and our &s;ervants, as hunters, and to
watch, in that dre&s;s, till chance &s;hould throw
my &s;i&s;ter in our way.</P>
<P>I &s;ometimes thought of going openly to my
father, and making one effort to awaken his
paternal feelings; to obtain my own pardon, and
my &s;i&s;ter's liberty; but after con&s;ulting with
Ormond, we agreed, that it was better to en|deavour
to &s;ee her fir&s;t; for a failure in the
&s;ucce&s;s of this &s;cheme would probably occa|&s;ion
her to be &s;o clo&s;ely confined, that we
might never have an opportunity of &s;eeing her
at all.</P>
<P>Equipped, therefore, as Izard hunters, we
reached this ca&s;tle&mdash;and wandered about a
whole day in its neighbourhood without any
<PB N="250" REF="252">
&s;ucce&s;s&mdash;the weather was &s;o inten&s;ely warm, for
it was now autumn, that I believed my &s;i&s;ter
came out only early in the morning, or late in
the evening&mdash;and that the be&s;t probability of
meeting her, was at tho&s;e hours&mdash;to take up
our abode near the ca&s;tle, therefore, was mate|rial,
and I recollected the banqueting-hou&s;e
in the wood, which had then, I imagined, been
long neglected, and where our re&s;idence could
not be &s;u&s;pected. But, on entering, I was
&s;urpri&s;ed to find it newly fitted up, and &s;ump|tuou&s;ly
furni&s;hed with every article that could
contribute to luxury and repo&s;e&mdash;this had
been done by the Je&s;uit's directions, and here
he now and then made little entertainments
for &s;ome favourite fathers of the convent
and their female penitents, which Apicius
or Marc Anthony might have beheld with
envy.</P>
<P>Dread of the Count's power and &s;everity,
effectually &s;ecured every part of his domain
from the intru&s;ion of any of the neighbouring
pea&s;ants. The pavilion, therefore, furni&s;hed as
it was, was never locked&mdash;and, as I imagined
nobody had &s;o good a right to it as my&s;elf, I
<PB N="251" REF="253">
took up my abode in it without much appre|hen&s;ion
of being di&s;lodged.&mdash;My friend oc|cupied
the other room, and our &s;ervants
found a lodging in the de&s;erted cabin of a
&s;hepherd, on the other &s;ide of the ca&s;tle;
from whence they were ordered to watch for
the appearance of the ladies we de&s;ired to &s;ee;
and immediately, on perceiving them, to ac|quaint
us.</P>
<P>The whole of the &s;econd day pa&s;&s;ed as the
fir&s;t had done; we wandered about the woods
that &s;kirt the ca&s;tle&mdash;but all about it appear|ed
the de&s;olate abode of &s;ullen de&s;poti&s;m.&mdash;At
night, when we had no longer any thing
to fear from the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e who
might belong to it, we approached its walls
more nearly, and watched the lights at the
windows, hoping that Genevieve might pa&s;s
with a candle; though even then it would
have been very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to
have apprized her of our being &s;o near.</P>
<P>If my friend had been eager for the expe|dition,
he was now more earne&s;t for its &s;uc|ce&s;s.&mdash;The
wild and mountainous country,
around a ca&s;tle &s;uch as is de&s;cribed as the ha|bitation
of enchanters, and mon&s;ters of fable,
<PB N="252" REF="254">
was exactly &s;uited to inflame his ardent and
romantic imagination&mdash;and when, to the&s;e
circum&s;tances, was added our purpo&s;e, to
&s;ave a young woman from the har&s;h &s;everity
of a father, and the wicked hypocri&s;y of a
Je&s;uit, he became an ab&s;olute enthu&s;ia&s;t; and
vowed, like a true knight errant, never to
leave the &s;pot till our adventure was &s;ucce&s;s|fully
accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd night, however, we were &s;lowly
retiring to our pavilion, and had almo&s;t
reached it, when we fancied that among the
trees, on one &s;ide of us, which were then cut
into alleys, we heard female voices talking low
and plaintively.&mdash;The evening was &s;o pro|foundly
&s;till that we heard every leaf that
quivered in the &s;carcely-perceptible air; and
the&s;e voices we now lo&s;t, now heard more
di&s;tinctly&mdash;till at length I was &s;ure that one
of them was the voice of Genevieve, though
it was &s;o long &s;ince I had heard it. I would
have flown into her arms&mdash;but Ormond, for
once more con&s;iderate than I was, withheld me,
by repre&s;enting to me, that if the per&s;on with
her &s;hould be the Je&s;uit's &s;i&s;ter, we &s;hould be
ruined by our ra&s;hne&s;s. In&s;tead, therefore, of
<PB N="253" REF="255">
&s;hewing our&s;elves abruptly, we glided along
on the other &s;ide of a treillage of beech, which
entirely concealed us, and, li&s;tening attentive|ly,
heard di&s;tinctly, that it was to her friend
Jacquelina, that my &s;i&s;ter addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I knew not whether my voice or the &s;ight
of me could alarm her lea&s;t; but at length
determined to walk from the banqueting|hou&s;e,
and meet her. We both, therefore,
proceeded &s;lowly down the walk in which &s;he
was, leaning on the arm of Jacquelina; but
neither of them immediately perceived us&mdash;and
I had time (for though it was evening,
every object was yet di&s;tinct) to ob&s;erve the
wonderful alteration that time had made in
the per&s;on of my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I had left her, a beautiful girl, of twelve
years old; her fine hair hanging loo&s;e over
her face and neck; and her features, though
then lovely and expre&s;&s;ive, not yet formed.&mdash;She
was now in her nineteenth year&mdash;with the
figure of a nymph, and a countenance beam|ing
with &s;en&s;ibility and &s;weetne&s;s&mdash;with a &s;en|&s;ibility
that &s;eemed to have no object, and
with &s;weetne&s;s that had &s;omething of patient
acquie&s;cence infinitely intere&s;ting. Her com|panion
<PB N="254" REF="256">
was &s;o beautiful a woman, that at
any other time, I &s;hould have been immedi|ately
&s;truck with her charms; but at this
moment, I had no eyes but for Genevieve&mdash;and
Ormond, who&s;e heart had been prepared
for any impre&s;&s;ion, was &s;o fa&s;cinated, that
forgetting my injunctions of &s;ilence, he ex|claimed,
"Heavens! Chevalier&mdash;you never
told me that your &s;i&s;ter was an angel!"</P>
<P>At this exclamation, though not uttered in
a loud voice, Genevieve, who&s;e eyes were be|fore
fixed on the ground, rai&s;ed them, when
&s;eeing two men approach, &s;he was extremely
alarmed, and taking Jacquelina by the arm,
&s;he cried&mdash;"Here are &s;trangers, my friend&mdash;let
us ha&s;ten back to the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>"No," cried I&mdash;"No, Genevieve, it is
no &s;tranger, but your brother, who comes to
defend and protect you." "My brother!
my dear brother!" &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"what, both!
is it po&s;&s;ible; can you be both &s;o good?"</P>
<P>I held her in my arms, for &s;he was unable
to &s;upport her&s;elf&mdash;while Ormond pa&s;&s;ionate|ly
exclaimed, "Oh, would to Heaven I were
your brother! but accept me, lovelie&s;t of
<PB N="255" REF="257">
women, as your friend; and be a&s;&s;ured, that
I will defend &s;o glorious a title with my
life."</P>
<P>She was &s;oon &s;o well recovered as to li&s;ten
to what I related to her, and her beautiful
eyes were turned towards Ormond, full of
&s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as charmed his very &s;oul&mdash;while
&s;he thanked him for having accompa|nied
her dear Chevalier. From her conver|&s;ation,
and from that of her amiable compa|nion,
I learned, that my infatuated father,
was not only entirely governed by his con|fe&s;&s;or,
but had lately &s;hewn &s;o much attach|ment
to the &s;i&s;ter whom he had introduced,
that there was every rea&s;on to apprehend the
con&s;equence of the increa&s;ing influence of
both. Genevieve, however, &s;poke of her fa|ther's
failings, and even of his unrea&s;onable
har&s;hne&s;s towards her, with reluctant &s;weet|ne&s;s
that was bewitchingly intere&s;ting; and
Ormond, in this &s;hort conver&s;ation, was gone
whole ages in love.&mdash;His eyes watched every
turn of her countenance&mdash;his ears drank the
&s;oft &s;ounds of her plaintive voice.</P>
<P>I &s;aw that the beauty, the &s;implicity of Ge|nevieve,
aided by the &s;ingularity of her &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="256" REF="258">
and the &s;cene in which he &s;aw her, had
effected an in&s;tance of what has often been
denied, and often ridiculed&mdash;love at fir&s;t &s;ight.
Neither Ormond, nor my &s;i&s;ter, nor I, were
con&s;cious of the cour&s;e of time; but Jacquelina
at length reminded her, that it would be ha|zardous
to be longer ab&s;ent from the ca&s;tle.
She in&s;tantly recollected her&s;elf, and &s;aid with
a &s;igh&mdash;"My Chevalier&mdash;we mu&s;t part&mdash;when
&s;hall we meet again?" It was agreed, that
by the earlie&s;t dawn of the following morn|ning,
we would wait for them in the wood,
near the pavilion: we attended them as far as
we dared, towards the approach to the ca&s;tle,
and then &s;lowly and unwillingly bade them
good-night.</P>
<P>Ormond &s;tood watching my &s;i&s;ter as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed among the trees, and when he could
&s;ee her no longer, he hinted to me, and &s;aid,
with an energy peculiarly his own, "Belle|garde,
I am in love with your &s;i&s;ter to di&s;|traction!"
"I am &s;orry for it, my friend,"
&s;aid I; "and why &s;orry?" interrupted he&mdash;with
an air of di&s;plea&s;ure; "becau&s;e," replied
I, "this attachment, if it indeed becomes
permanent, though very honourable to her,
<PB N="257" REF="259">
may be a &s;ource of mi&s;ery to you both.&mdash;My
father has &s;o great an antipathy to an Engli&s;h-man
and a Prote&s;tant, that were a man, who is
both, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the world, I am convinced he
would refu&s;e him his daughter."&mdash;"Refu&s;e,"
cried Ormond: "Do you think I would a&s;k
him? or do you, Chevalier, mean to leave
your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;&s;uch a &s;i&s;ter&mdash;here in his power?"&mdash;"I
hardly know what I mean yet, my dear
friend. Let us, however, do nothing ra&s;hly,
le&s;t we injure the objects we wi&s;h to &s;erve."&mdash;Alas!
at that time, I was cool and collected,
and could argue with the romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m
of my friend; but in a few days I was as
madly in love with Jacquelina, as Ormond was
with my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The impediments between us, were as great
as tho&s;e between my friend and Genevieve&mdash;Jacquelina
was of inferior birth, the daughter
of one of my father's va&s;&s;als; and to the &s;ul|len
pride of the Count of Bellegarde nothing
could be &s;o repugnant as &s;uch an alliance.
I was not yet of the age when &s;ons were al|lowed
to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves; and my al|lowance
from my father would, I was well
a&s;&s;ured, be in&s;tantly withdrawn, if I offended
<PB N="258" REF="260">
him anew&mdash;All the&s;e con&s;iderations, however,
weighed nothing again&s;t the violence of my
pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and determined as I was to marry
Jacquelina, and to give Genevieve to my
friend, the only difficulty &s;eemed to be to find
a Prie&s;t on whom we might depend; for, &s;en|&s;ible
of our affection as were the objects of our
love, they refu&s;ed to leave their home unle&s;s
under the protection of their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>While I was &s;tudying how to find and &s;e|cure
the fidelity of &s;uch a man as we had oc|ca&s;ion
for, Genevieve endured from the in&s;o|&s;ence
of the Je&s;uit, and the encroaching au|thority
of Mademoi&s;elle D'Aucheterre, his
&s;i&s;ter, in&s;ults which &s;he dared not avow to us
in all their extent. But Jacquelina, when &s;he
was alone with me, &s;pake with le&s;s re&s;erve,
and told me &s;he had no doubt but that it was
the plan of D'Aucheterre, the Je&s;uit, to marry
his &s;i&s;ter to the Count: and that &s;o entirely
was he governed by him, that there was no
doubt of his falling into the &s;nare. This was
very unplea&s;ant intelligence; but I forgot it
when &s;he added, that &s;he dreaded every day
le&s;t the walks Genevieve was now allowed to
take &s;hould be prohibited.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261">
It was nece&s;&s;ary immediately to hazard
&s;omething. I contrived to make an acquaint|ance
with one of the younger Monks of the
convent&mdash;he had never &s;een me as the Cheva|lier
de Bellegarde, and believed, for &s;ome time,
that I was an hunter, from Pau in Berne. At
length, when I believed my&s;elf tolerably ac|quainted
with him, I told him who I was, and
with what view I had &s;o long lingered about
my father's abode, from whence I had been
many years exiled. From the manner of his
receiving this intelligence, I believed I could
tru&s;t him&mdash;It was very hazardous; for the
Fathers of the Convent were for the mo&s;t part
decidedly in the intere&s;t of the Je&s;uit&mdash;But I
offered to this Monk the means of gratifying
&s;ome of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which his poverty and
mode of life afforded him little opportunity of
indulging&mdash;and he agreed to do whatever I
plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The ri&s;ing &s;un of the following morning
&s;aw my friend Ormond the enraptured hu&s;|band
of the lovely Genevieve; and gave
me, in Jacquelina, the only woman who
&s;eemed to me worthy to be her friend.&mdash;Trembling
at every breath of air, at every
<PB N="260" REF="262">
whi&s;per of the falling leaves, they hurried
back to the ca&s;tle&mdash;where an unu&s;ual degree
of tranquillity &s;eemed on that day to reign.&mdash;The
Count &s;pake kindly to his daughter&mdash;and
&s;he, encouraged by the certainty of now be|longing
to the man &s;he loved, put a re&s;traint
upon her&s;elf, and behaved with more civility
to D'Auchterre and his &s;i&s;ter than &s;he could
generally command. In the evening they
met us as u&s;ual; but our felicity was embit|tered
by the apprehen&s;ions for our &s;afety that
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Jacquelina.&mdash;"Though
there is not a pea&s;ant, or a &s;hepherd, round
the domains of the ca&s;tle," &s;aid &s;he, "that
loves the Count well enough to do him any
kindne&s;s on his own account, yet fear may
have the influence which affection and grati|tude
have not. Some of them have been tell|ing
the &s;ervants that two &s;trangers have been
&s;een for many days among the mountains,
who call them&s;elves Izard hunters, though
they have no dogs with them; that nobody
knows where they &s;leep, or how they live;
and that they are &s;u&s;pected to belong to a
banditti who have for &s;ome time infe&s;ted the
Vall&eacute;e d'Aran, about the &s;ource of the Ga|ronne.
<PB N="261" REF="263">
This whi&s;per," continued Jacquelina,
"terrifies me. It was only to-day I heard it,
and I have never had a tranquil moment &s;ince:
I figure to my&s;elf that your lodging in the
banqueting-hou&s;e may be di&s;covered; that
you may be taken up&mdash;impri&s;oned&mdash;puni&s;hed."&mdash;I
endeavoured to appea&s;e the fears of my
angelic wife, though I felt that they were too
well founded. Ormond, intoxicated by love,
and knowing le&s;s of the manners of the people
than I did, treated them &s;lightly&mdash;"Let them
come," &s;aid he;&mdash;"are we not armed?" The
following day, however, Genevieve and Jac|quelina
met us in increa&s;ed alarm. The re|ports
among the &s;ervants gained ground&mdash;the
Je&s;uit had heard of them, and had &s;aid to
Genevieve and her friend, that if &s;uch men
were lurking about the confines of the ca&s;tle,
their early and late walks would become very
un&s;afe, and that he mu&s;t &s;peak to the Count
to forbid them.</P>
<P>To remain another night in the pavilion
was not &s;afe. Our little council deliberated
what to do, and Love was the pre&s;ident.
Under his au&s;pices, the timid Genevieve
learned courage to propo&s;e what appeared a
<PB N="262" REF="264">
more hazardous mea&s;ure than to remain where
we were. "The ea&s;tern &s;ide of the ca&s;tle," &s;aid
&s;he, "is never inhabited on that &s;ide: the
guard-room, and the rooms above and under
it, have not been opened for many years:&mdash;in
that quarter, you, my Chevalier, may recol|lect
there was a con&s;iderable breach made in
one of the &s;ieges, and the windows are di&s;|mantled
and broken &s;till&mdash;as nobody ever
goes near that range of rooms, would there be
much danger in your remaining in them till
we can depart?"</P>
<P>"The danger," cried Ormond; "is no
con&s;ideration, but why &s;hould we not depart
immediately? why &s;hould you and Jacquelina
ever return to the ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>To this my &s;i&s;ter an&s;wered, that unle&s;s pre|cautions
were taken, &s;uch as &s;he feared we had
not thought of, our flight would undo us&mdash;"My
father," &s;aid &s;he, "by the death of that
nobleman, who was the mo&s;t powerful among
his enemies, has obtained the government of
Rou&s;&s;illon, and has even had offers of other
advantages which may awaken his dormant
and di&s;appointed ambition. Thus armed with
powers to detect our flight, con&s;ider what
<PB N="263" REF="265">
would be the con&s;equence of our being mi&s;&s;ing,
if we are not &s;ure of getting out of his reach
before he can exert that power. Secure, if
po&s;&s;ible, the means of an e&s;cape, and we will
fly: in the mean time, you mu&s;t think of your
own &s;afety till that can be done."</P>
<P>We were too much in love to rai&s;e any dif|ficulties
to a plan which brought us nearer the
objects of our affections; and the remark
Genevieve made as to the difficulty of our
carrying her and Jacquelina with us, without
&s;ome quicker means of conveyance than their
delicate limbs afforded them, was perfectly
ju&s;t. How to procure &s;uch conveyance was
a matter that required more deliberation than
the pre&s;ent moment afforded, and it was there|fore
agreed that at night, when all about the
ca&s;tle was quiet, Genevieve and Jacquelina
&s;hould be at one of the lowe&s;t windows on the
ea&s;tern &s;ide; and that we &s;hould cro&s;s the
moat, and by their aid a&s;cend to that window,
which we con&s;idered as a very ea&s;y under|taking.</P>
<P>As it was now late in the autumn, and
there was no moon, it was dark enough for
our purpo&s;e. We cro&s;&s;ed the moat with ea&s;e,
<PB N="264" REF="266">
and found our lovely conductre&s;&s;es waiting
for us; with almo&s;t equal ea&s;e a&s;cended the
broken wall, and I was thus in my father's
hou&s;e, unknown to him, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the paternal man&s;ion of my ance&s;tors as if
I had been a robber and an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>Here, however, under &s;uch circum&s;tances,
I pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t fortunate period of my life&mdash;Ah!
&s;hort and fleeting felicity&mdash;which never,
never can return again!</P>
<P>We were not, however, &s;o intoxicated with
our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, as to neglect the means
of its continuance; but nothing was &s;o diffi|cult
as to carry them into execution. It was
only of a night I could get out, for with &s;uch
a commi&s;&s;ion I was unwilling to entru&s;t the
daring and impetuous Ormond; and the ap|plication
I made for hor&s;es at two or three
villages at hours &s;o unrea&s;onable, rai&s;ed
&s;uch &s;u&s;picion of my intention, that I twice
narrowly e&s;caped being &s;eized by the pea&s;ants
as one of the banditti; and once, on my return
to the ca&s;tle, was watched and compelled, in|&s;tead
of entering it by the window, as u&s;ual,
to plunge into the woods, and conceal my&s;elf
till the following evening: while my wife, my
<PB N="265" REF="267">
&s;i&s;ter, and Ormond &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel
anxiety and were almo&s;t dead with apprehen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>After this un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;ally, they entreated
me not to venture out again, and we continued
to live on &s;ome time longer in &s;ecurity. The
immen&s;e extent of the ca&s;tle made our abode
in this uninhabited part of it attended with
very little ri&s;h; for the pa&s;&s;ages were all &s;tone,
and our foot&s;teps could not be heard, even if
we had not taken all precautions again&s;t noi&s;e.
The appearance of complai&s;ance which Gene|vieve
was compelled to a&s;&s;ume towards
D'Aucheterre, obtained for her any little fa|vour
&s;he cho&s;e to a&s;k of him: and he allowed
her frequently to dine in her own apartment,
while his &s;i&s;ter was thus enabled to carry on,
with more &s;ucce&s;s, her plan of operations
again&s;t the heart of the Count, in which in|deed
&s;he had made a much greater progre&s;s
than we apprehended. Thus we were &s;upplied
with food without rai&s;ing any &s;u&s;picion, and
were &s;o well content with our con&s;inement,
&s;ince it was the impri&s;onment of love, that
could we have been &s;ure of its continuance
with &s;afety to the objects of that love, we
<PB N="266" REF="268">
&s;hould never have regretted our lo&s;s of li|berty.</P>
<P>To this moment I am ignorant of the
means by which we were di&s;covered, though
I can impute it only to the treachery of the
Monk who married us. It was after mid|night,
near five weeks after our re&s;idence in
the ca&s;tle, that I was awaked by a loud &s;hriek
from Jacquelina, who at the &s;ame moment
threw her arms about me.&mdash;I &s;tarted up, and
flew to a cutla&s;s which I u&s;ually placed in a
chair near the bed; and with which I defended
Jacquelina for &s;ome moments, till I was &s;tunned
by a blow which one of the ruffians who &s;ur|rounded
me aimed at the back of my head,
and I recovered not my &s;en&s;es till many hours
afterwards, when I awoke in a kind of litter,
in which two hideous figures guarded me, with
their &s;words drawn. I was confined by heavy
chains; and when I enquired why I was thus
fettered like a malefactor, I was &s;hewn a Lettre
de Cachet, which directed me to be conveyed to
the Ba&s;tile&mdash;and thither I was now travelling.
Oh, Sir, if you have ever loved! you may be
enabled to judge what were my feelings!&mdash;Yet,
who was ever &s;o cruelly outraged&mdash;who
<PB N="267" REF="269">
was ever torn from &s;uch a woman, unle&s;s it
was my unhappy friend, Ormond!&mdash;who&s;e
fate I had rea&s;on to fear was yet &s;everer than
my own&mdash;becau&s;e I doubted whether my fa|ther,
&s;avage and inhuman as he was, could
exerci&s;e on me exactly the &s;ame degree of
cruelty, which he would feel him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed
to inflict on one who, in addition to his being
the hu&s;band of Genevieve, was an Engli&s;hman,
and an heretic. The anxiety I felt for his
fate, and for that of my &s;i&s;ter, and the dread
of what might have befallen Jacquelina, who&s;e
&s;hrieks, as they endeavoured to tear her from
me, yet vibrated in my ears, made me in&s;en|&s;ible
of my own &s;ufferings, notwith&s;tanding
my wounds and the inconveniences of my con|finement.
But my guards were ob&s;tinately
&s;ilent, and neither threats nor entreaties could
procure for me the lea&s;t intelligence of what
was to be the fate of the beloved friends from
whom they had divided me.</P>
<P>While any hope remained, I retained &s;ome
degree of compo&s;ure and recollection: but at
length de&s;pair took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me&mdash;I be|came
delirious&mdash;Furious, frantic, I was only
prevented by my chains from de&s;troying, fir&s;t
<PB N="268" REF="270">
my keepers, and then my&s;elf.&mdash;I knew nothing
of what happened for many days, during the
di&s;order of my &s;en&s;es: when I recovered them,
I was in a room in one of the towers of the
Ba&s;tile, &s;o much weakened with the lo&s;s of
blood that they had taken from me during my
frenzy, that I could not leave my bed. My
head had been &s;haved, and I was under the
regimen appointed for tho&s;e who are decidedly
in&s;ane.&mdash;Pardon me, if I here a&s;k your pa|tience
till to-morrow&mdash;the recollection of what
I then &s;uffered is too painful for me to dwell
upon longer; and when I think that the&s;e &s;uf|ferings
were inflicted by a father!&mdash;Here
the Count put his hand on his heart, and
&s;ighed deeply. Willoughby remarked in
his eyes that un&s;ettled expre&s;&s;ion that &s;till
bore te&s;timony of the &s;tate of mind into which
the &s;ufferings he had been relating had thrown
him; and extremely affected him&s;elf by the
Count's narrative, he was glad, powerfully as
his curio&s;ity was excited, to delay hearing the
melancholy cata&s;trophe, for melancholy he
feared it mu&s;t be, till the next day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Count de Bellegarde and Wil|loughby
met the next morning, the former
&s;eemed perfectly compo&s;ed, but pen&s;ive and
melancholy. It was early&mdash;he propo&s;ed walk|ing
towards the convent; "and as we go,"
&s;aid he, "I will conclude, as briefly as I can,
my mournful hi&s;tory. I will not dwell upon
the nature of my &s;ufferings in the Ba&s;tile: of
much of the time I pa&s;&s;ed there I have no per|fect
recollection; and, for the re&s;t, &s;uffice it
to &s;ay that, by the orders of my inflexible
father, I endured all the rigours of im|pri&s;onment,
in its mo&s;t hideous form for
&s;everal months, during which I made &s;ome
attempts to e&s;cape&mdash;Attempts, the failure of
which only &s;erved to convince me of the im|po&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="270" REF="272">
of effecting it; and, in the impo|tency
of rage, I cur&s;ed my exi&s;tence, and,
I fear, reproached Heaven it&s;elf for permitting
&s;uch horrors on earth. The idea of Jacque|lina,
abandoned to the inhuman vengeance
of a man capable of acting with &s;uch malig|nity
towards his own &s;on; the thoughts of the
mi&s;ery in which I had probably been the
means of involving Ormond and Genevieve,
hardly &s;uffered me to attend to my own wretch|edue&s;s,
when I was capable of feeling it; but
many weeks pa&s;t in wild ravings about <HI>them,</HI>
and then for my&s;elf I felt nothing.</P>
<P>"I thus lo&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e mi&s;erable days, the
cau&s;e of which, when I was &s;en&s;ible, I marked
on the wall of my pri&s;on. I had now, though
my reckoning was thus rendered defective,
pa&s;t near two years in my pri&s;on; when my
barbarous father, at the interce&s;&s;ion of my
brother the Baron, &s;ent a prie&s;t to offer me
my relea&s;e on certain conditions: one of
which was, that I &s;hould immediately, on leav|ing
my confinement, be conducted to my re|giment,
which was then in garri&s;on at Li&s;le,
and give my parole that I would not quit it
without the permi&s;&s;ion of the commanding
<PB N="271" REF="273">
officer. Though I &s;aw that this re&s;triction was
intended to prevent my gaining any intelli|gence
of Jacquelina, of Ormond, or of my
&s;i&s;ter, I gave the promi&s;ed de&s;ire, as being re|lea&s;ed
from my dete&s;ted pri&s;on always &s;eemed
a &s;tep towards them; and two days afterwards
the governor of the Ba&s;tile delivered me to the
per&s;ons whom my father had &s;ent for me; and
I was thus conducted, like a pri&s;oner, to join
the regiment, where the colonel, a friend of
the Count's, took care to take the parole in
the &s;tronge&s;t manner; and believing, perhaps,
that under &s;uch circum&s;tances I &s;hould not
feel my&s;elf bound in honour to keep it, he
continued to have me watched &s;o &s;trictly that
I was &s;till in fact a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>"And thus, at the age of twenty-nine, was I
treated; my &s;oul revolting again&s;t the tyranny,
without the means of e&s;caping from it, and
con&s;uming it&s;elf in vain projects, to &s;ee or to
hear from the wife &s;o adored&mdash;from friends
&s;o tenderly beloved.</P>
<P>"A few days, however, after my arrival at
Li&s;le, my brothers, D'Ermenonville and the
Baron De Rochemarte, came in di&s;gui&s;e to find
me. They hardly knew me, &s;o greatly was
<PB N="272" REF="274">
I changed by de&s;pair and confinement; but
without giving them time to expre&s;s their
concern, I enquired for Jacquelina&mdash;for Or|mond,
for our &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"Their countenances, particularly that of
the Baron, told me that I had only tidings
of &s;orrow to expect; and knowing the &s;tate
in which my mind had been, he &s;tudied a
moment how to &s;often them; but the impa|tience
of my fear would not give him time&mdash;"Tell
me," cried I, "tell me, where is Jac|quelina,
where is Genevieve, where is my
friend Ormond? They are dead, I know they
are; that inhuman man, who calls him&s;elf
my father, has de&s;troyed them all."</P>
<P>"No," replied the Baron, "Ormond lives,
and is long &s;ince returned to England&mdash;Jac|quelina
lives; but lives not for you; &s;he has
taken the veil.&mdash;As for our unfortunate &s;i&s;ter,
&s;he is, perhaps, happier; &s;he has been dead
&s;ome months."&mdash;This cruel intelligence&mdash;that
of the three beings deare&s;t to me on earth I
&s;hould never again &s;ee either, was too much
for me.&mdash;Again I lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of my mi&s;ery
in delirium; and it was many days before I
could attend to the con&s;olation offered me by
<PB N="273" REF="275">
the Baron, or the lighter arguments by which
D'Ermenonville attempted to wean me from
reflections which it could an&s;wer, he &s;aid, no
purpo&s;e to indulge. The &s;tate I then fell into
was only another &s;pecies of madne&s;s. I no
longer raved or vented my &s;ury in cries and
execrations; but I became &s;ilent and &s;ullen:
never &s;poke but to the Baron, who &s;till at|tended
me with paternal pity, and got leave
of the commandant to do &s;o; and whatever I
&s;aid to him was only enquiries after &s;ome par|ticulars
relative to Jacquelina and my &s;i&s;ter, in
which he could not &s;atisfy me&mdash;all that he
knew being from my father, or Madame de
Bellegarde; for the &s;i&s;ter of the Je&s;uit, D'Au|cheterre
had long &s;ince been rai&s;ed to that
title, and had brought the Count to Paris,
where he was again admitted to &s;uch a &s;hare
of power as had enabled him to execute more
&s;ecurely his unnatural vengeance.</P>
<P>"As I was no longer capable of duty, and
my malady &s;eemed to be incurably fixed:&mdash;as
Jacquelina had taken the vows, and was for
ever out of my reach, the Baron obtained
leave for me to go with him to a hou&s;e he
had in Normandy; where the patient pity
with which he watched over me, gradually re|&s;tored
<PB N="274" REF="276">
me to my &s;en&s;es! but I regained them
only to feel with keener angui&s;h all the hor|rors
of my de&s;tiny. The Count de Bellegarde,
now far advanced in life, and repenting, per|haps,
whenever his new wife gave him leave
to think, of his cruel treatment of his daugh|ter,
expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome inclination to &s;ee and to
forgive me; but I felt that it was <HI>I</HI> who had
much to forgive: and, alas! I felt, too, that
though he was my father I could not forgive
him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t moment in which I enjoyed
both rea&s;on and liberty, I &s;hould have u&s;ed in
flying to Perpignan, where, with difficulty, I
learned that Jacquelina was confined; but I
had promi&s;ed the Baron, that I could not yet
attempt it, and to him I held my word to be
&s;acred, whatever it co&s;t me to keep it. All
my pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction was in traver&s;ing the
&s;ea coa&s;t, near which my brother's hou&s;e was
&s;ituated, and looking towards England, whence
I every day expected to hear of Ormond, to
whom I had written. Impatiently I waited
month after month for an an&s;wer. I wrote
again; but &s;till I heard nothing. At length
I recollected the name of an Engli&s;h gentle|man,
with whom Ormond lived in habits of
<PB N="275" REF="277">
intimacy while he was in France. I wrote to
him, and my letter was immediately an&s;wered.
He informed me, that Captain Ormond, who
had returned to England about ten months
before in a very bad &s;tate of health, had been
ordered very &s;oon afterwards to America, with
his regiment, which was &s;ent thither to quell
the troubles which about that time broke out
in the Engli&s;h colonies. Thus I had no
longer any hope of &s;eeing my dear friend, who
was of a di&s;po&s;ition to have joined me in my
attempt, however hazardous, for the recovery
of Jacquelina, which I was at all events deter|mined
to try at.</P>
<P>"Wild and impo&s;&s;ible as the project was, it
had taken &s;uch forcible hold of my imagina|tion,
that rea&s;on was no longer heard. I
concealed my intentions, however, carefully
from my brother&mdash;affected compo&s;ure, I was
far from feeling; and, as he began to be|lieve
me reconciled to my de&s;tiny, he no
longer refu&s;ed to talk of Jacquelina, when I
calmly led the di&s;cour&s;e to that &s;ubject: and
by degrees he told me all he knew, which was,
indeed, little more than the name of the con|vent,
where &s;he had taken the veil, at Per|pignan.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278">
"Having gained all the in&s;truction I could,
I left a letter to the Baron, who had long
cea&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon any parole; and telling
him that being now well enough to return to
my duty, I &s;hould merely &s;ee Jacquelina, take
an eternal adieu, and then rejoin my regiment.
I &s;at out alone in the night, and, taking bye|roads,
arrived at Perpignan.</P>
<P>"I found a brother of Jacquelina's, who was
&s;ettled there: he confirmed all I had heard
of the compul&s;ion that had been u&s;ed by the
Count to force my unhappy wife to take the
veil. He had threatened the de&s;truction of
her whole family: he had impri&s;oned her fa|ther,
and a&s;&s;ured her that I was dead. If I
&s;huddered at this relation, judge how my ten|derne&s;s,
my regret, my rage was encrea&s;ed
when this brother of my Jacquelina went on
to &s;peak of what he thought I had known.
That &s;he became a mother during this inhuman
per&s;ecution; and that an infant daughter then
exi&s;ted. My &s;i&s;ter, too, had given birth to a
daughter; and died in con&s;equence of the
angui&s;h of mind &s;he &s;uffered at having her
child taken from her. "Where are the&s;e chil|dren?"
cried I, in an agony it is impo&s;&s;ible to
de&s;cribe;&mdash;"Oh, carry me in&s;tantly where I
<PB N="277" REF="279">
may claim them!" "Alas, Sir!" replied my
wife's brother, "my &s;i&s;ter's child was taken
by my mother, who, ill as &s;he could afford it,
would never part with it to the Count, who,
offered to provide for it; becau&s;e &s;he doubted
what were his de&s;igns. She doubted, indeed,
with rea&s;on, for the other baby was &s;ent away
to Bayonne, as was then &s;aid; but every
thing relative to it was &s;o &s;ecretly managed,
that nobody knew for a long time what was
become of it: and it was not till &s;ome time
afterwards that my &s;i&s;ter, who from her ten|der
affection for Mademoi&s;elle Bellegarde, was
as anxious for it as for her own, per&s;uaded me
to enquire about it; for we all dreaded to
hear that the Count, under the influence of the
D'Aucheterres, had been very cruel indeed
to it!</P>
<P>"Oh! Sir, reflect a moment on my feel|ings
at this detail. In the &s;ame breath, I
bade my informer go on with the account of
all he knew of Ormond's child, and carry me
to my own. The wildne&s;s of my impatience
frightened him; he endeavoured to &s;oothe me
with a&s;&s;urances that my infant was living,
and well, and then told me as gently as
he could, that he had been guilty of a
<PB N="278" REF="280">
breach of promi&s;e in naming it, for that
the Count had made the whole family enter
into an agreement never to let me know any
thing about the child.&mdash;Irritated by this new
in&s;tance of barbarity, I &s;wore, in a tran&s;port of
pa&s;&s;ion, that I would have my daughter re|&s;tored
to me, or peri&s;h in the attempt; and
that I would find the child of my murdered
&s;i&s;ter if I traver&s;ed the world."&mdash;"Alas! my
dear Chevalier," &s;aid my wife's brother, "there
will be danger enough for you even in at|tempting
to &s;ee your own daughter; for the
Count has never cea&s;ed to have it watched: but
for that of your &s;i&s;ter, you will certainly never
recover it. All my re&s;earches, which I a&s;|&s;ure
you were not indolently nor feebly made,
traced it no farther than into the hou&s;e of a cer|tain
Madame de Pellatier at Bayonne, a friend
of the pre&s;ent Madame de Bellegarde, who
undertook"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Madame de Pellatier!" cried Willoughby,
"Oh! eternal Heaven, are you &s;ure&mdash;Merci|ful
God!&mdash;are you &s;ure it was Madame de
Pellatier?"</P>
<P>Amazed at the vehemence and &s;ingular
manner of Willoughby, for which he could
&s;o little account&mdash;the Count looked at him a
<PB N="279" REF="281">
moment, and then &s;aid&mdash;"Am I &s;ure? Yes,
very &s;ure&mdash;Have you then any knowledge
of Madame de Pellatier?"&mdash;"Oh! if I could
tell you," cried Willoughby, in agitation that
deprived him of his breath&mdash;"but I cannot&mdash;'tis
impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;yet thus much&mdash;Did you re|cover
the daughter of your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;was &s;he
ever re&s;tored to you?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"No, never," an&s;wered the Count, "all the
intelligence I was long afterwards to obtain was,
that Madame de Pellatier had placed her in a
convent at Hiers; but her name was changed,
and before I could obtain, after my la&s;t re|turn
to France, even this information, the
people who had received her were dead, and
I could only gue&s;s from &s;ome memorandums
kept in the convent, 'that a child, whom I
gue&s;&s;ed to have been the &s;ame, was taken from
thence by an Engli&s;h lady."&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is Cele&s;tina," cried Willoughby, in the
wilde&s;t tran&s;port, "it is my own Cele&s;tina.
She is mine again&mdash;without a doubt, without
any impediment, mine!"&mdash;He was con&s;cious,
that at that moment he was not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his &s;en&s;es, &s;o extravagant was his joy. The
Count, accu&s;tomed as he had been to the im|pul&s;e
of violent pa&s;&s;ions him&s;elf, was a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="280" REF="282">
at this phrenzy, becau&s;e he compre|hended
not what had produced it, nor could
Willoughby, for &s;ome moments, command
him&s;elf enough to explain it; till at length,
from this paroxy&s;m of agonizing joy he &s;unk
at once with as deep dejection, for the proba|bility
had occurred to him, that, at the very
moment when he was exulting in having &s;o
wonderfully and &s;o unexpectedly di&s;covered
the birth of Cele&s;tina, and thus recovered all
his lo&s;&s;es&mdash;&s;he was, perhaps, married&mdash;and no
longer intere&s;ted for him&mdash;nor &s;olicitous to
enquire on his account to whom &s;he belonged.</P>
<P>Then as every hour's delay might be fatal
if this had not already happened, he deter|mined
to &s;et out in&s;tantly for England. The
wonder, however, with which he &s;aw the Count
&s;urvey him recalled his wandering and bewil|dered
&s;en&s;es; and as well as he could, though
very incoherently and inarticulately, he re|lated
his hi&s;tory to the Count&mdash;</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Bellegarde had not a doubt
but that Cele&s;tina of Willoughby was his
niece; every circum&s;tance, as they became
cool enough to compare them, an&s;wered ex|actly.
Convinced of this, and becoming every
in&s;tant more partial to his gue&s;t, the Count
<PB N="281" REF="283">
now entered with the warme&s;t intere&s;t into all
his apprehen&s;ions le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e her; and
approved of his ha&s;tening in&s;tantly back to
England&mdash;Willoughby now intreated him to
return to the ca&s;tle, that he might not wa&s;te a
moment&mdash;for on the event of a moment, per|haps,
&s;aid he, my life depends. As they re|turned,
however, the Count concluded his own
hi&s;tory, and Willoughby, &s;ince Cele&s;tina was
concerned in it, commanded that portion of
attention which, perhaps, no other &s;ubject,
however otherwi&s;e intere&s;ting, could at that
moment have commanded.</P>
<P>"I was not deterred," &s;aid the Count de
Bellegarde, "by any of the threats that my
father had uttered; but I flew to the convent
where Jacquelina was. It was gue&s;&s;ed by
my impatience and ardour who I was&mdash;and I
was refu&s;ed admittance to the grate. I then
had recour&s;e to the di&s;gui&s;e of a female dre&s;s;
and, in de&s;pite of all the menaces that had
been thrown out again&s;t their family, I pre|vailed
on one of her &s;i&s;ters to accompany me."</P>
<P>"I &s;aw her!&mdash;but &s;he did not know me.&mdash;Her
eyes were ca&s;t down; &s;he was pale and
thin&mdash;re&s;ignation and patience &s;eemed to have
<PB N="282" REF="284">
&s;oftened the horrors of her de&s;tiny&mdash;but they
gave to her faded beauty an intere&s;t &s;o power|ful,
that I never loved her &s;o ardently as that
moment&mdash;I would have forced my&s;elf through
the grate, which was one of tho&s;e that are &s;o
narrow as &s;carcely to admit an hand.&mdash;I threw
my&s;elf again&s;t it&mdash;I &s;poke to her&mdash;&s;he then
knew me, and caught hold of the bars to &s;ave
her&s;elf from falling&mdash;I ki&s;&s;ed her hand in the
wilde&s;t tran&s; orts&mdash;I be&s;ought her to remem|ber,
that her vows were not&mdash;could not be bind|ing,
either in the &s;ight of God or man!&mdash;that &s;he
was my wife; and that again&s;t the infamousty.
ranny that had divided us, all nature revolted."
Thus I raved, while tears, &s;uch as angels &s;hed,
fell from her lovely eyes&mdash;"Oh! Bellegarde,"
&s;aid &s;he, when &s;he was able to &s;peak, "This
is all vain and frantic rage!&mdash;learn, my dear,
dear friend, to &s;ubmit, as I do, to a fate,
which, cruel as it is, is inevitable&mdash;I am
dead to you!&mdash;for from hence, no power, no
force, can now relea&s;e me&mdash;ah! they told me
you were no more&mdash;or never, never would I
have taken tho&s;e vows, which my heart re|fu&s;ed!&mdash;But
it is done!&mdash;and this &s;hort mo|ment
is the la&s;t we &s;hall ever have!"&mdash;At this
<PB N="283" REF="285">
in&s;tant the &s;uperior of the convent, and &s;everal
nuns appeared, and &s;everely reproaching her,
forced her from the grate&mdash;"Inhuman,"
&s;aid &s;he,&mdash;"even this la&s;t moment is denied
me!&mdash;farewell, my dear Bellegarde&mdash;farewell
for ever&mdash;believe I am dead; and transfer
the tenderne&s;s you felt for your Jacquelina&mdash;to
her little Anzoletta&mdash;in her I &s;till live."
This &s;entence was hardly articulate, amid the
efforts her per&s;ecutors made to force her away&mdash;when
I lo&s;t &s;ight of her, again I threw my|&s;elf
frantically again&s;t the grate that divided,
I beat my head again&s;t it&mdash;fury and de&s;pair
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me anew&mdash;and I became, for &s;ome
days, again in&s;en&s;ible&mdash;or &s;en&s;ible to nothing
but the &s;ight of my little girl, who&s;e innocent
&s;miles appea&s;ed my rage, and made me recol|lect
that there was yet a being in the world for
whom I ought to live.</P>
<P>"Every calm interval was employed in pro|jects,
more wild, perhaps, than my wilde&s;t
ravings; to force Jacquelina from her ac|cur&s;ed
impri&s;onment. I talked about it con|tinually
to her brothers, and per&s;uaded my|&s;elf
that nothing was impo&s;&s;ible to a man &s;o
injured, and &s;o attached as I was. My fa|ther,
<PB N="284" REF="286">
however, was too powerful in a province,
where he was governor, and in a community
into which he had influence to get Jacquelina
received, notwith&s;tanding her re&s;i&s;tance, and
even her marriage. At this time, power did
every thing in France, and nature and ju&s;tice
were &s;ilenced&mdash;thank God it is &s;o no longer!"</P>
<P>In this ejaculation, Willoughby mo&s;t &s;in|cerely
joined, and the Count proceeded:&mdash;</P>
<P>"My father, as I was about to ob&s;erve, was
too well &s;erved to leave me any probability of
&s;ucce&s;s in this mad project; far from being
able to procure the liberty of my wife, I could
Rot pre&s;erve my own&mdash;but was, under pre|tence
of my in&s;anity, carried away a pri&s;oner
from Perpignan; and the only favor the Ba|ron
could obtain for me was, that I might be
confined in his hou&s;e in Normandy.&mdash;Here I
remained only a &s;hort time, &s;unk again into
the impotent fullenne&s;s of de&s;pair, when the
regiment, to which I belonged, was ordered to
America, and my father de&s;ired I might go.
I wi&s;hed for death&mdash;and had I had any mo|tives
to de&s;ire life, my honour compelled me
not to he&s;itate. For America then I em|barked;
and on my arrival, my fir&s;t care was
<PB N="285" REF="287">
to enquire for the Engli&s;h regiment, in which
my friend Ormond had a company. I heard,
from de&s;erters, that it had &s;uffered greatly in
the beginning of the war, and was ordered
back to England. Even the mournful &s;atis|faction
which I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf in em|bracing
my friend, the hu&s;band of my beloved
unfortunate Genevieve, &s;eemed thus to be de|nied
me; and every circum&s;tance contributed
to promote that de&s;peration, that impatience
of life, which is the effect of incurable cala|mity.</P>
<P>"Before I left France, I had recommended
my infant Anzoletta to the care of the Baron,
in ca&s;e of my death, and &s;ecured to her all the
property that would be at my di&s;po&s;al, on the
death of my father. I thought, that were
Jacquelina dead, I &s;hould think of her with
le&s;s painful regret, than I did now; langui&s;h|ing
within the walls of a mona&s;tery; of my
natural friends, only the Baron, and D'Erme|nonville,
affected to feel any intere&s;t in my
fate: the former was now deeply engaged in
the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion as a &s;oldier; and for
the latter, he was decidedly a di&s;ciple of Epi|curus&mdash;and
made it a rule of his life to enjoy
<PB N="286" REF="288">
every po&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, and avoid every po&s;&s;i|ble
pain&mdash;of cour&s;e, my lo&s;s would be but
&s;lightly felt by either of my brothers&mdash;and
my father&mdash;for &s;o many years my per&s;ecutor
and tyrant, would rejoice at it. I continually
&s;ought death as my only refuge again&s;t the evils
he had inflicted upon me; and what was
called bravery, was, in fact, de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"In one of the rencontres which our troops
and the revolted Americans had with the
Engli&s;h army, it was my chance to be &s;tationed
to defend a &s;mall po&s;t on the borders of an
immen&s;e wood, with a &s;mall detachment of
French. The engagement was warm between
the main bodies; but the troops, under my
command, were not called into the action.
Impatient to be thus idle, I &s;ent one of my
aid-de-camps to the general, repre&s;enting,
that we were ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s where we were,
and entreating his leave to advance; when he
returned and told me, that the battle was
over with di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;s; that the Engli&s;h
had &s;uffered greatly, particularly in their of|ficers;
while the Americans and French,
hardly in a better condition, were making
their retreat, which I was directed to cover
<PB N="287" REF="289">
with my fre&s;h troops. I advanced, therefore,
through the wood by the way I was directed;
and after proceeding half a mile, I met a party
of Indians, in the intere&s;t of the coloni&s;ts, car|rying
with them an Engli&s;h officer, who was,
they &s;aid, mortally wounded. By his uni|form,
he appeared to be of rank&mdash;I approached
him, and &s;poke to him in French. Judge of
my &s;en&s;ations, when I &s;aw in this dying pri|&s;oner
my friend, my Ormond!&mdash;Not even the
calls of duty were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing as tho&s;e of friend|&s;hip.&mdash;I
even deliberated a moment, whether
I &s;hould not hazard every thing to attend him
my&s;elf&mdash;but when I expre&s;&s;ed this, though he
could hardly &s;peak, he conjured me to go on,
and merely to take him out of the hands of
the Indians.&mdash;"I know I mu&s;t die," &s;aid the
gallant fellow, "but I would die in your hands&mdash;if
you can, without injury to your honour,
grant me &s;uch an indulgence." I ordered a
guard to convey him, with the utmo&s;t care,
to the neare&s;t French quarters; and then
ha&s;tening to obey the orders I had received, I
had the happine&s;s, &s;ucce&s;sfully, to execute
them; and having done &s;o, hurried to my
friend.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290">
"I found he had received every a&s;&s;i&s;tance
which in the &s;ituation we then were, could be
given him: he was ea&s;y, and though his
wounds were mortal, his death was not likely
to happen immediately.</P>
<P>"He thanked me, as &s;oon as he again &s;aw
me, for my attention to him&mdash;and then eagerly
a&s;ked me after his wife&mdash;and his child&mdash;"but
&s;he is dead," cried he&mdash;"my Genevieve is
dead; I was but too certain of that before
I left Europe."&mdash;My &s;ilence, my tears, con|firmed
the &s;ad truth. "Well, my dear
Chevalier," cried he, clinging my hand, "I
am following her fa&s;t&mdash;I knew what you would
tell me of my infant&mdash;of that dear pledge
of my Genevieve's affection. Your inhuman
father has eluded your &s;earch, as he did mine.
Oh! I could cur&s;e him!&mdash;but I will not, be|cau&s;e
he is your father. If ever your friendly
&s;olicitude for the offspring of your &s;i&s;ter, and
your friend, &s;hould enable you to di&s;cover
her, give her the&s;e pictures&mdash;they are tho&s;e of
her father&mdash;of his favourite &s;i&s;ter;&mdash;of her
mother&mdash;&s;ee," added he,&mdash;"this re&s;emblance
of Genevieve which &s;he gave me, when I re|ceived
the dear avowal of her love; never till
<PB N="289" REF="291">
now has it left my bo&s;om&mdash;and I conjure
you, Bellegarde, never to part with it, till
you place it on that of my daughter.</P>
<P>"My noble friend lingered a few days longer&mdash;not
in great pain, however, and perfectly
&s;en&s;ible&mdash;and then, in my arms, he re&s;igned
his gallant &s;pirit to his God.</P>
<P>"This lo&s;s added &s;trength to the gloomy re|&s;olution
I had before made to die. Among
my friend's papers, which, by his order, his
&s;ervant delivered to me, after his death, I
found a narrative of all he had done, after his
relea&s;e from impri&s;onment in the Ba&s;tile, at
the demand of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador (for
he was there part of the time that I was,
though we never &s;aw each other,) to gain ad|mittance
to his wife, and to have his child
re&s;tored to him&mdash;and &s;uch an abhorrence did
this add to that I had already conceived
again&s;t my father, that I could not bear the
name of Bellegarde; nor endure to think of
returning to breathe the &s;ame air with a man
whom I con&s;idered as a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>"To France, however, I returned&mdash;without
even a wound in all the hazards to which I had
<PB N="290" REF="292">
voluntarily expo&s;ed my&s;elf. This inhuman
father was &s;till living&mdash;but my brother, the
Baron de Rochemarte, had fallen at the head
of his regiment, at the attack made on the
i&s;land of Jer&s;ey&mdash;and I &s;ucceeded to his for|tune&mdash;a
fortune, which, ample as it was,
could make me no amends for the excellent
kind brother I had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"Alas! I had lo&s;t two brothers&mdash;and two
friends equally dear to me&mdash;they were not to
be recalled&mdash;but I &s;till found a gloomy kind
of &s;atisfaction in complying with their la&s;t re|que&s;ts.
That of my brother de Rochemarte
was, that I would take his name; and mo&s;t
willingly I quitted that of Bellegarde&mdash;the
dying reque&s;t of my beloved friend I endea|voured&mdash;ah!
how vainly endeavoured to ful|fil&mdash;I
never could di&s;cover his daughter till
this fortunate day!</P>
<P>"But my re&s;idence among the Americans,
had awakened in my mind a &s;pirit of freedom.
The mi&s;eries, the irreparable injuries I had re|ceived
from ill-placed and exorbitant power,
prompted me to a&s;&s;ert it. I was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of con&s;iderable property&mdash;u&s;ele&s;s to me, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="291" REF="293">
Jacquelina could not &s;hare it&mdash;though
comparatively free my&s;elf, I was wretched.
In this di&s;po&s;ition, it may ea&s;ily be ima|gined,
that if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power, I was not
without inclination to add fewel to that fire,
which immediately after the end of the war in
America, was kindled, though it yet burnt
but feebly in France. I wrote&mdash;I acted upon
my newly-acquired principles, with the energy
of a &s;ufferer, and with the re&s;olution of a mar|tyr.
I <HI>was</HI> already the martyr of de&s;poti&s;m,
and ruined in my happine&s;s for ever. I knew
that all the vengeance I could excite could
injure me no farther.</P>
<P>"I now &s;aw Jacquelina&mdash;but &s;he was &s;till
pining within her convent.&mdash;I &s;aw my child&mdash;I
held her to the grate while her mother be|dewed
her little hands with tears, which I
ki&s;&s;ed off!&mdash;It was a &s;cene to move every heart
but &s;uch as inhabited the brea&s;t of my father!
Again, the hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of re&s;cuing my wife
from her cruel bonds, gave him occa&s;ion to
put other fetters on me. In the ra&s;hne&s;s of
my de&s;peration, I &s;aid, I wrote, I acted &s;uch
things as made me be con&s;idered by govern|ment
<PB N="292" REF="294">
as a dangerous per&s;on. My father took
advantage of my ra&s;hne&s;s&mdash;he repre&s;ented me
as being di&s;ordered in my &s;en&s;es, and obtained
an order for &s;hutting me up in the fortre&s;s of
Mont St. Michel.</P>
<P>"Between four and five years had I been a
captive in that gloomy pri&s;on, when the glo|rious
flame of liberty, of which I only &s;aw the
fir&s;t feeble rays, bur&s;t forth&mdash;I regained my
per&s;onal fredom, when my country became
free&mdash;I found my father dead!&mdash;Every thing
he could give away, his wife po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but
this, and &s;ome other of his e&s;tates, were mine&mdash;and
D'Ermenonville gave me, with the
hands which then gave the title of Bellegarde,
the name, which I abhor; and which, though
it is yet given me by the people, who have
been accu&s;tomed to give it to the head of my
family, I will not keep&mdash;but take that of
Montignac, which is my <HI>untitled</HI> name, the
original de&s;ignation of our family.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t u&s;e I made now of the general and
particular freedom, in which I rejoiced, was
to fly to Perpignan&mdash;but the moment is not
yet come, when I can deliver my impri&s;oned
<PB N="293" REF="295">
Jacquelina. I am, however, a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he
will very &s;oon be re&s;tored to me; in that hope
I came hither to attend to my long-neglected
affairs, and to enjoy the &s;ociety of my daugh|ter.
Even greater happine&s;s has been the
con&s;equence of my abode here than I dared to
hope; for by you, my friend, towards whom,
the moment I &s;aw you, I was impelled by an
invincible propen&s;ity, I &s;hall, I tru&s;t, recover
the dear orphan child of Genevieve and Or|mond.</P>
<P>"In a few days I &s;hall go back to Perpignan;
leave Anzoletta again in the care of her mo|ther's
family, and then ha&s;ten to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the
glorious bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ecuring the liberty of
France&mdash;yes!&mdash;the immortal work of defend|ing
myriads yet unborn from ever &s;uffering
the oppre&s;&s;ions, under which I have groaned."</P>
<P>Here the Count de Bellegarde ended his nar|rative;
and Willoughby, with an inexpre&s;&s;i|ble
contrariety of &s;en&s;ations&mdash;joy and hope&mdash;fear
and apprehen&s;ion&mdash;being furni&s;hed with
every a&s;&s;urance he could wi&s;h, of the real pa|rents
of Cele&s;tina, took a tender leave of the
Count and Anzoletta, who&s;e voice was to him
as the voice of a &s;eraph, promi&s;ing him feli|city
<PB N="294" REF="296">
to come, and he then departed, as had
been agreed upon between him and the Count,
for Perpignan: where he delivered, at the
grate, a letter to Jacquelina&mdash;of whom the
Count had de&s;ired that &s;he would de&s;cribe to
Willoughby any particulars of the per&s;on of
his wife, which &s;he recollected&mdash;for in her
care, the infant Cele&s;tina had been left a few
weeks.</P>
<P>With trembling impatience Willoughby
waited while the intere&s;ting, and &s;till lovely
nun peru&s;ed this letter&mdash;and heard her, while
his heart &s;unk with apprehen&s;ion, thus de|&s;cribe
the child of her unfortunate friend&mdash;</P>
<P>"She was," &s;aid Jacquelina, "fairer than
my child, and her features greatly re&s;embled
tho&s;e of her father.&mdash;On her neck, a little on
the left &s;ide, were three remarkable, though
diminutive, moles."&mdash;"It is enough," &s;aid
Willoughby&mdash;"tho&s;e moles are on the lovely
neck of Cele&s;tina&mdash;a thou&s;and times have I
ki&s;&s;ed them as we played together in our in|fancy&mdash;and
here on this portrait of her, drawn
when &s;he was about twelve years old, they are
de&s;cribed."</P>
<P>Jacquelina ki&s;&s;ed the picture,&mdash;"Little as
<PB N="295" REF="297">
can be judged from a likene&s;s done &s;o many
years afterwards, I feel an a&s;&s;urance," &s;aid
&s;he, "that this is the picture of my Gene|vieve's
child. May heaven grant her tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings
which, in its un&s;earchable decrees, it re|fu&s;ed
to my lovely, luckle&s;s friend." Wil|loughby,
who would not have been a moment
d&eacute;tained by any interview le&s;s intere&s;ting, or
le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, now took his leave, and with
the utmo&s;t expedition, though all he could
make, an&s;wered but ill to his impatience, he
ha&s;tened on towards England.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed at Roche|marte,
Cele&s;tina, no longer doubting of Wil|loughby's
marriage, and entire de&s;ertion of
her, was trying to acquire once more that
calm re&s;ignation, which &s;he had &s;o often de|termined
to adopt, and &s;o often lo&s;t.&mdash;Mon|tague
Thorold accompanied Lady Horatia
to Cheltenham; where, as Cele&s;tina fore&s;aw,
his ardent entreaties, and the wi&s;hes of her
friend, &s;o &s;trongly enforcing them, gave her
&s;o much pain, that &s;he grew, hourly more
fond of the &s;chcme &s;he had adopted, of
travelling. If &s;he found it difficult to evade
the importunities of her lover, and her bene|factre&s;s,
&s;he dreaded yet more the arrival of
<PB N="297" REF="299">
the elder Mr. Thorold; who, about &s;ix|weeks
after Montague's recovery, came with
him (after a &s;hort vi&s;it he had paid at home)
to Cheltenham.</P>
<P>He &s;oon found an opportunity of &s;peaking
to Cele&s;tina, alone, and then &s;he became more
than ever con&s;cious of the influence that
his &s;olid under&s;tanding, his excellent prin|ciples,
and his tender regard for her, gave
him over her ingenuous mind.&mdash;Though he
never complained, &s;he well knew, that he
was not happy in the other branches of his
family, and that his hopes were particularly
fixed on his younger &s;on, who&s;e attachment
to Cele&s;tina, which, had it been &s;ucce&s;sful,
might have &s;ecured, in one point, the felicity
of his father, had hither to produced for him
only anxiety and &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>He had &s;een his life once more in immi|nent
hazard, from the fierce and impetuous
Vava&s;our, and from his own ra&s;hne&s;s, which
he could not but condemn; he had &s;een,
for many months, all his talents, and almo&s;t
all his affections, lo&s;t and ab&s;orbed in this
one predominant pa&s;&s;ion, and he knew not
what the effect might be on his intellects,
<PB N="298" REF="300">
and on his health, &s;hould he finally be refu&s;|ed:
yet, while Willoughby was uncertain as
to his own &s;ituation, or unmarried, the elder
Mr. Thorold had been withheld from making
any efforts with Cele&s;tina, on behalf of his
&s;on: now, tho&s;e impediments were removed,
he no longer thought him&s;elf re&s;trained from
applying to her him&s;elf. So mildly and
rationally, however, he entered on this conver|&s;ation,
that Cele&s;tina retained more courage,
while &s;he heard him, than &s;he, at its com|mencement,
had dared to expect; and when
he had recapitulated all the advantages which
might, he thought, be derived, from her
union with a man &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to
her, of &s;uitable age; of ea&s;y fortune&mdash;one
who&s;e ta&s;te was congenial to her own; who&s;e
temper was remarkably good, and who had
a heart uncorrupted by vice, and unexhau&s;t|ed
by a long cour&s;e of intrigue; and a fa|mily
who would con&s;ider her admi&s;&s;ion into it,
as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that they could receive;
Cele&s;tina acknowledged it was all very true.
"I own too, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "that to many
people, and perhaps to you, I may have ap|peared
to give your &s;on &s;uch encouragement,
<PB N="299" REF="301">
as never ought to be given, unle&s;s it is meant
to end in marriage.&mdash;I have felt, without
having it in my power to avoid this &s;eeming
impropriety&mdash;yet he will do me the ju&s;tice
to &s;ay, I have always told him, that whatever
were my &s;entiments in his favour, and how|ever
I wi&s;hed to encourage tho&s;e &s;entiments,
becau&s;e I was per&s;uaded he de&s;erved them,
yet, that my heart never felt for him that
decided preference, without which, I cannot
believe, he could be happy, were I to give
him my hand&mdash;I was too &s;ure, that from an
unfortunate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in favour of another,
it never could feel this preference; and that,
therefore, though I &s;hould always be happy
to be con&s;idered as his friend, I never would
be his wife. Allow me, dear Sir, to repeat
to you, a re&s;olution from which I do not be|lieve
I &s;hall ever recede&mdash;you know how true
a love and veneration I have for you&mdash;there
is not on earth, a man whom I would &s;o &s;oon
chu&s;e to &s;upply to me that &s;acred and tender
relation&s;hip I have never known! and to call
by the endearing name of father! but I can|not&mdash;indeed
I cannot marry. I know not
why, but &s;ome invincible per&s;ua&s;ion hangs
<PB N="300" REF="302">
over me, that if I do, I &s;hall be mi&s;erable,
and render my hu&s;band mi&s;erable, whatever
may be his merit or affection&mdash;and can I,
ought I, under &s;uch a conviction, to wi&s;h it?
Be a&s;&s;ured, that if time and rea&s;on conquer
this weakne&s;s&mdash;for perhaps it may be only
weakne&s;s&mdash;if ever I feel that I can give to
your &s;on a heart, weaned from every other at|tachment,
and worthy of his, I will &s;ay &s;o&mdash;as
candidly, as I declare the impo&s;&s;ibility of
my doing &s;o now&mdash;and you are &s;o liberal, that
you will forgive my weakne&s;s, and &s;ave me,
I am &s;ure, from importunity, which is the
more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as it comes from tho&s;e I &s;o
much e&s;teem, and who&s;e wi&s;hes it would be,
on any other &s;ubject, my pride and my plea&s;ure
obey."</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold, after this conver&s;ation, and
&s;ome other of the &s;ame nature, was convinc|ed,
that Cele&s;tina acted from motives of the
mo&s;t delicate honour&mdash;the more he &s;aw of her
heart and di&s;po&s;ition, the more fondly he be|came
attached to her; and the more ardently
de&s;ired that &s;he might become the wife of his
&s;on. He &s;aw, that though her ideas were
what would be generally called romantic, they
were not cheri&s;hed merely becau&s;e they were
<PB N="301" REF="303">
&s;o; but that a high &s;en&s;e of the tender duty
&s;he wi&s;hed to pay to the man with whom &s;he
was to pa&s;s her life, made it impo&s;&s;ible for
her to enter into &s;uch engagements till &s;he
was &s;ure of fulfilling them according to her
own ideas&mdash;and he hoped, that her entire &s;e|paration
from Willoughby; his unkindne&s;s
and neglect on one hand; and on the other,
the acknowledged merit of his &s;on, would,
though almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, yet not &s;lowly, pro|duce
that change which &s;he allowed her&s;elf to
be po&s;&s;ible, though at pre&s;ent it did not &s;eem
probable. In this hope he was contented to
re&s;t; and promi&s;ing Cele&s;tina, that if &s;he
would &s;till allow Montague to &s;ee her fre|quently,
he &s;hould not teize her by importu|nity&mdash;he
threw him&s;elf entirely on her gene|ro&s;ity
and &s;incerity; and after a vi&s;it of near a
week, he left Montague at Cheltenham, by the
de&s;ire of Lady Horatia, and returned home.</P>
<P>In a few days after his departure, Cele&s;tina
had another and more painful &s;cene to en|counter.
Cathcart arrived early one morn|ing,
and eagerly a&s;ked to &s;peak to her&mdash;&s;he
went down to him immediately&mdash;but when
&s;he &s;aw him, &s;he dared not a&s;k the purpo&s;e of
<PB N="302" REF="304">
a vi&s;it &s;o little expected. He was pale&mdash;he
trembled and he&s;itated&mdash;he looked fatigued
and dejected.&mdash;Willoughby in&s;tantly recurred
to her&mdash;for he was always the fir&s;t object of
her thoughts&mdash;"Is any thing the matter, dear
Cathcart," &s;aid &s;he "with Willoughby?"&mdash;"Oh,
no," replied he; "nothing new&mdash;I
have not heard of him &s;ince he went, which
I think &s;trange."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina &s;ighed, and thought &s;he was able
too well to account for it&mdash;"but is Je&s;&s;y"
well? "Yes, thank Heaven," replied he:
"but my &s;i&s;ter"&mdash;"what, Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone?"
"no my other&mdash;my unfortunate
&s;i&s;ter Emily&mdash;I have been &s;ent for to her at
Bri&s;tol, where, you know I went to her &s;ome
time &s;ince, at your entreaty: &s;he has now, I
think, only a few days to live&mdash;my &s;i&s;ter
Elphin&s;tone is with her&mdash;poor Emily wi&s;hes
to &s;ee you&mdash;I know not how to a&s;k &s;uch a fa|vour
of you; but you are <HI>&s;o</HI> good&mdash;will you&mdash;can
you oblige a family&mdash;who already owe
to you all the happine&s;s they po&s;&s;e&s;s?"</P>
<P>"What will I not do to give any part of
it &s;atisfaction," &s;aid Cele&s;tina&mdash;"but do you,
can you gue&s;s the rea&s;on of your &s;i&s;ter's wi&s;hes
<PB N="303" REF="305">
to &s;ee me? &s;urely Vava&s;our is not there?&mdash;"He
was not, when I left her; but a few
days before, he had been at Bri&s;tol, raving
like a madman at the fatal intelligence he had
then had confirmed&mdash;that Emily could not
live. If, however, he &s;hould come, you can
have nothing to fear, for I will not leave you
a moment; and I know you &s;o well, that I
am per&s;uaded, there are few di&s;agreeable cir|cum&s;tances,
which would not, to you, be
compen&s;ated, by the reflection of having given
comfort to the la&s;t moments of my dying
Emily."</P>
<P>This plea Cele&s;tina could not re&s;i&s;t: &s;he
went, therefore, by the con&s;ent of Lady Ho|ratia,
with Cathcart, to Bri&s;tol; where a &s;cene
awaited her, that for &s;ome time almo&s;t &s;u&s;|pended
even her thoughts of Willoughby
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The lovely, unhappy victim, to early &s;e|duction,
was in the la&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;ump|tion&mdash;and,
unlike tho&s;e who are cut off by that
di&s;temper, was perfectly aware, and perfectly
reconciled to her fate&mdash;her earne&s;t wi&s;hes had
been to be forgiven by Cathcart, and to die
in the arms of her &s;i&s;ter; they both now at|tended
<PB N="304" REF="306">
her with the tendere&s;t affection, and
had even yielded to her reque&s;t, to be allowed
to &s;ee Vava&s;our, towards whom all her anxie|ty
was now turned, and for his happine&s;s &s;he
felt that concern, which &s;he no longer was
&s;en&s;ible of for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Her exhau&s;ted heart was, from gratitude
and habit attached to Vava&s;our; and &s;he &s;aw
that her death would take away the only tie
that had been &s;ome re&s;traint on his ungovern|able
licentiou&s;ne&s;s: that his di&s;appointment
in regard to Cele&s;tina, had embittered his
temper; and given him a &s;ort of excu&s;e for
the libertini&s;m in which he &s;eemed re&s;olute to
per&s;evere; and while his good qualities, his
genero&s;ity, and his candour, as well as his
attentive tenderne&s;s towards her, had made
her affection for him the la&s;t &s;entiment &s;he was
capable of feeling: &s;he fancied it yet po&s;&s;ible,
young as &s;he was, Cele&s;tina might be induced
to &s;ave a man who appeared &s;o well worth the
attempt: and that, intere&s;ting as he appeared
to her, he could not fail of having &s;ome in|tere&s;t
with others, and particularly with one
who had learned from Willoughby an early
prejudice in his favour, which &s;he hoped all
<PB N="305" REF="307">
his &s;ub&s;equent ra&s;hne&s;s had not yet wholly
de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Such were the views of Emily Cathcart, in
reque&s;ting this vi&s;it; and her beautiful eyes,
lit up with the fire that was con&s;uming her,
became yet more dazzlingly bright when her
lovely vi&s;itor was led into the room by her
brother.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina entered trembling; and fearing
the &s;ight of Vava&s;our, whom &s;he had never
met &s;ince the terrifying night at Ranelagh;
but the moment &s;he beheld Emily, &s;he no
longer thought of any thing but the affecting
object before her.</P>
<P>Emily &s;at in a great chair, &s;upported by
pillows&mdash;the extreme beauty that had been
&s;o fatal to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, &s;till remained, though
its lu&s;tre was gone&mdash;Emaciated, and of a de|licate
fairne&s;s, her hands and her face had a
tran&s;parency that gave an idea of an unembo|died
&s;pirit, and her dre&s;s was &s;uch as favour|ed
the deception. The blood might almo&s;t
be &s;een to circulate in her veins, &s;o plainly did
they appear; and her eyes had the dazzling ra|diance
of ethereal fire, to which the hectic heat
of her glowing, though wafted countenance,
<PB N="306" REF="308">
&s;till added.&mdash;A few locks of her fine light
hair had e&s;caped from her head-dre&s;s; and
played like broken rays from a receding planet,
round a face, which only tho&s;e who had hearts
unhappily rigid, could behold, without feel|ing
the &s;en&s;e of her errors &s;u&s;pended or over|whelmed
by &s;trong emotions of the tendere&s;t
pity.</P>
<P>She held out her hand to Cele&s;tina, as &s;he
entered, and in a voice faint and interrupted,
from the difficulty with which &s;he breathed,
&s;aid&mdash;"Ah! deare&s;t madam, how good this
is; how worthy that tender and &s;en&s;ible heart,
of which I have heard &s;o much"&mdash;&s;he &s;topped;
as if unable to &s;peak more at that moment,
and re&s;ted her head again&s;t the chair&mdash;Cele&s;|tina
affected to tears, &s;at &s;ilently down near
her&mdash;Cathcart left the room.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e, &s;he recovered &s;trength
to &s;ay, "but a moment will be allowed
me, perhaps; let me then ha&s;ten to thank
you for this conde&s;cen&s;ion, and to &s;ay,
how earne&s;tly it is my hope, that it will not
be made in vain; but that it will afford me
an opportunity of &s;ucce&s;sfully pleading&mdash;for
another penitent&mdash;for poor Vava&s;our."</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309">
"I forgive him mo&s;t willingly," cried Ce|le&s;tina&mdash;"and
mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h him
happy."</P>
<P>"Ah, Madam!" &s;aid Emily&mdash;"You mu&s;t
then carry your genero&s;ity farther&mdash;for you
only can make him &s;o&mdash;I dared to repre&s;ent
this in a letter to you&mdash;I now repeat it&mdash;vic|tim,
as I am, even in the morning of my days,
I &s;hould, however, die in peace, for I hope
my peace is made with Heaven&mdash;if I could
&s;ee any pro&s;pect of Vava&s;our's being happy;
reclaimed from that wild career where he is
now wa&s;ting his time, his fortune, and his
life. I owe him &s;o many obligations! I know
him to have &s;o good a heart! that it is terri|ble
to me to &s;ee him devoted as he is, and
plunging into an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery, from whence
it will &s;oon be no longer in his power to re|turn.&mdash;It
has been a great con&s;olation to me,
that I have had &s;ome little influence in &s;tem|ming
the progre&s;s of the evil; but it is you
only who can &s;ave him from him&s;elf effectu|ally;
and how worthy would it be of good|ne&s;s,
of compa&s;&s;ion like yours?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina knew not what to an&s;wer.&mdash;To
promi&s;e what &s;he never, could perform, was
<PB N="308" REF="310">
little in her nature: yet did &s;he not love to
check the di&s;intere&s;ted hope that thus ani|mated
the &s;oft heart of the fair pleader. "I
believe," &s;aid &s;he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, "I be|lieve
you are mi&s;taken: and that I have no
&s;uch power as you impute to me; be a&s;&s;ured
that, though Mr. Vava&s;our's conduct has
been to me a &s;ource of the mo&s;t poignant
unea&s;ine&s;s, I not only will forget it, but &s;hall
rejoice in &s;eeing him happy&mdash;for his own
&s;ake&mdash;and for the &s;ake of that dear friend
through who&s;e means we fir&s;t became ac|quainted:
a friend"&mdash;her voice trembled, and
&s;he dared not attempt to name Willoughby,
le&s;t it &s;hould wholly fail her&mdash;"a friend who
is &s;till, and who I dare believe will ever be
truly attached to him: and who, on his re|turn
to England, will, I am &s;ure, u&s;e all the
influence that friend&s;hip gives him over Mr.
Vava&s;our, to recal him from a way of life
you &s;o much apprehend." She was proceed|ing
to evade, as tenderly as &s;he could, the pa|thetic
prayer &s;he had ju&s;t heard, when Emily
was &s;eized with one of tho&s;e &s;pa&s;ms which
announced her approaching death. Cele&s;tina,
terrified, called for Mrs. Elphin&s;tone; and,
<PB N="309" REF="311">
unable to bear a &s;cene in which &s;he could be
of no u&s;e, &s;he retired to another room, where
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed with Cathcart, two melancholy
hours, at the end of which, they heard that
the fair unhappy Emily was no more.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, who was in another lodging at
the Hot-wells, no &s;ooner heard of this &s;ad
event, than the wilde&s;t frenzy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him:
nor did his having &s;o long expected it, at all
mitigate the blow.&mdash;He ran to the hou&s;e, and
regardle&s;s of Cathcart and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
who would have oppo&s;ed the&s;e frantic ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of u&s;ele&s;s regret, he threw him&s;elf on
his knees by the bed&s;ide&mdash;called to her, as
if &s;he were &s;till living&mdash;was &s;ure &s;he &s;hould
not die&mdash;and now reproached Heaven that
&s;he was dead. From this &s;tate of temporary
in&s;anity, nothing had the power to recal him&mdash;till
Cathcart, reproaching him very warm|ly,
for the impropriety of his conduct, a&s;ked
him, whether it was thus he meant to pro|mote
the la&s;t wi&s;hes of his &s;i&s;ter, and obtain
the pardon of Mi&s;s De Mornay? That name
had &s;till all its influence on the heart of Va|va&s;our:
by a &s;trange, though, perhaps, not
uncommon divi&s;ion of his affections, at once
<PB N="310" REF="312">
vehemently loved the woman he had lo&s;t, and
the woman he hoped to gain.&mdash;Starting from
his knees, he a&s;ked where Cele&s;tina was? for
Cathcart had not yet told him of her arrival,
and had promi&s;ed to prevent his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing her.&mdash;"Mi&s;s
De Mornay is below, Sir; but you
mu&s;t not go to her." "Not go to her! who
&s;hall prevent it?" was his an&s;wer&mdash;and he
ha&s;tily went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>When he entered the room where Cele&s;tina
&s;at weeping with Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, he had
every appearance of a man out of his &s;en&s;es:
but, at the &s;ight of her, he &s;eemed &s;ubdued in
a moment; and while &s;he dreaded &s;ome wild
and frantic &s;peech, he threw him&s;elf on his
knees before her, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>His convul&s;ive &s;obs, as he eagerly caught
her hands, and pre&s;&s;ed them to his heart; and
the broken voice in which he attempted to
&s;peak, di&s;armed her at once of all the re&s;ent|ment
which &s;he had, till then, felt for his un|warrantable
behaviour, when they la&s;t met&mdash;and
&s;o tenderly, in a voice of &s;uch &s;oothing
pity did &s;he &s;peak to him, that he &s;oon be|came
rea&s;onable&mdash;thanked her for her gene|rous
attention; even ble&s;&s;ing her, and calling
<PB N="311" REF="313">
her the re&s;torer of his rea&s;on&mdash;while Cele&s;tina
availed her&s;elf of this di&s;po&s;ition of his mind,
to prevail on him to retire; which he did, on
her promi&s;e, that &s;he would &s;ee him again the
next day.</P>
<P>After a mournful night, of which more
was pa&s;&s;ed in comforting and con&s;oling Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone than in &s;leep, that day arrived,
on which Cele&s;tina was not only bound by
the promi&s;e which in the agitation of mind
&s;he was in the night before, &s;he had made to
Vava&s;our, to &s;ee him; but induced to declare
to him again, how totally he was mi&s;taken
in &s;uppo&s;ing her engaged to Montague Tho|rold.
Again he cheri&s;hed the hope which
&s;he never meant to revive; and at once to do,
what he knew would gratify her, while he
acquitted him&s;elf of the promi&s;e he had given
to his regretted Emily, he had a deed drawn
up and executed, by which he gave to Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, and her children, two hundred
a year; and &s;ettled them at the hou&s;e he had
in Devon&s;hire. On the moment of her de|parture,
he gave this deed to Cele&s;tina, be|&s;eeching
her not to open it till her arrival at
Cheltenham. "And whither are you going,
<PB N="312" REF="314">
Mr. Vava&s;our?" &s;aid Cele&s;tina, who felt her
pity revive for him, now that &s;he &s;aw him &s;o
dejected and &s;ubdued. "Ah," replied he, "I
am carele&s;s whither&mdash;I cannot, however, go
back to my Stafford&s;hire hou&s;e in the &s;tate of
mind I am in now; for I &s;hould infallibly
hang my&s;elf;&mdash;I believe I &s;hall go to Lon|don&mdash;for,
even at this time of year, a wretch|ed
dog, &s;uch as I am, may find &s;omebody or
other to help them to get rid of them&s;elves;
and the gaming hou&s;es are always open.&mdash;"The
gaming hou&s;es!" &s;aid Cele&s;tina.&mdash;"Aye,"
replied he, "I have been there al|ways
of late when I have been cur&s;edly mi|&s;erable&mdash;and
play has a momentary effect on
me, in making me forget other things. Per|haps,
in wandering about London, I may
meet with &s;ome un&s;ettled, unhappy fellow,
like my&s;elf, who may like to go abroad for
&s;ix or eight months: we may go find Wil|loughby,
perhaps, and my return may be the
more welcome to <HI>you,</HI> if I bring you an ac|count
of <HI>him.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Alas!" thought Cele&s;tina, "what ac|count
of <HI>him</HI> can I now hear with plea&s;ure;
unle&s;s indeed that he is well; that I always
<PB N="313" REF="315">
wi&s;h to hear! and I <HI>think,</HI>" added &s;he, her
heart &s;welling as &s;he &s;aid it&mdash;"I think I &s;hould
<HI>&s;incerely</HI> rejoice to hear, that in his new &s;itua|tion&mdash;he
is happy with his <HI>wife!</HI>"</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, again feeling the renewal of that
hope which had almo&s;t e&s;caped him, &s;aw Ce|le&s;tina
depart with more calmne&s;s than he ex|pected.
Cathcart &s;aw her &s;afe in the pro|tection
of Lady Horatia, at Cheltenham; and
then returned to Bri&s;tol, to perform the la&s;t &s;ad
offices to his lo&s;t Emily; Vava&s;our, at his
and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone's reque&s;t, leaving the
place before her remains were con&s;igned to
their early grave.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes which, during this period, pa&s;&s;ed
in the family of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, were more
turbulent, and to &s;ome of the parties equally
melancholy.</P>
<P>The anxious peer, who&s;e health was, as
u&s;ual, a little amended by change of country,
waited at Paris the promi&s;ed arrival of Wil|loughby,
with extreme impatience: impatience
which had &s;uch an effect upon his feeble frame,
that death, which had &s;o long been laying in
wait for him, now &s;eized him, and at a period,
when the blow &s;aved him from knowing what
<PB N="314" REF="316">
could not have been concealed from him many
hours. Lady Ca&s;tlenorth having enacted with
great dignity all that a mournful relict <HI>mu&s;t</HI>
do on &s;uch an occa&s;ion: and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
having al&s;o performed her part ad|mirably,
the will was opened in due form,
of which Lady Ca&s;tlenorth thought her&s;elf
perfectly &s;ure of the contents; and &s;he had
indeed &s;ecured to her&s;elf a great deal of mo|ney,
and a &s;plendid income, be&s;ides her &s;et|tlement.
The property de&s;cending to Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, immediately, was about eight
thou&s;and a year; but, in a codicil (made in
the immediate plea&s;ure he received when
Willoughby fir&s;t declared him&s;elf re&s;olved to
marry his cou&s;in) he had given him an e&s;tate
of five-and-twenty hundred a year; and ten
thou&s;and pounds in money, as a nuptial pre|&s;ent;
without, however, affixing any condi|tions
to the gift.</P>
<P>The &s;hort ceremony of reading the will be|ing
over, another was to be gone through
le&s;s ea&s;y to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman; which was,
announcing to her mother her actual marriage
with Captain Cavanaugh&mdash;which &s;he thought
<PB N="315" REF="317">
mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be revealed by &s;omebody
el&s;e.</P>
<P>The dialogue was &s;hort, but deci&s;ive&mdash;Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, or rather Mrs. Cavanaugh,
had more courage than tenderne&s;s; and hav|ing
now nothing to fear from her mother's
influence with her father; and &s;ecure of her
fortune, both at pre&s;ent and in rever&s;ion, &s;he
a&s;&s;umed rather an air of triumph than of con|trition.
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth would be but
faintly de&s;cribed by the &s;tronge&s;t of tho&s;e re|pre&s;entations
that have been given of an en|raged
woman, when &s;he has been compared
to a tygre&s;s robbed of her young.&mdash;Cava|naugh
had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art to make her be|lieve,
that his admiration of her mental per|fections
was the foundation of that attach|ment
he felt for her; yet, that while he ador|ed
her beautiful mind, her fine per&s;on was an
object of tender admiration. To find that he
cared for neither the one nor the other; but
had availed him&s;elf of her credulity to obtain
a footing in the family; and money to get his
matrimonial fetters broken, that he might
marry her daughter, were convictions &s;o ex|tremely
<PB N="316" REF="318">
mortifying to her pride, that they,
for a while, &s;u&s;pended the power of expre&s;&s;ing
her rage&mdash;When, however, that power return|ed,
&s;he raved like a lunatic&mdash;gave way to the
mo&s;t extravagant &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and,
though her Lord was yet unburied, prote&s;ted
that the &s;ame hou&s;e &s;hould no longer hold her
and her "pelican daughter." Mrs. Cavanaugh
was more calm, and retired to her room:
where Mrs. Calder, at length, per&s;uaded Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth to let her &s;tay till after the re|mains
of her father were &s;ent forward to Eng|land,
which they were in a few days; and
then Mrs. Cavanaugh &s;et out, by the way of
Rouen, to England al&s;o, with her hu&s;band,
who was impatient to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
great acqui&s;itions, the price of &s;o much pa|tient
perfidy.&mdash;Though he would willingly
have been excu&s;ed giving to Willoughby even
the &s;mall &s;hare of the ample property which
his uncle had a&s;&s;igned to him; yet he knew
he mu&s;t &s;ee the will, and finally obtain it. He
thought it better, therefore, to continue with
him the appearance of honour; and therefore
wrote to him, informing him of Lord Ca&s;tle|north's
death; of his own marriage; and the
<PB N="317" REF="319">
codicil in favour of Mr. Willoughby. But
not knowing whither to direct this letter; for
Willoughby had left no intimation of the
route he meant to pur&s;ue, when he quitted
Paris; he addre&s;&s;ed it to Alve&s;tone; where,
with one on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s from Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth, it lay, while Willoughby was
wandering among the Pyrenian mountains,
and while he pur&s;ued his impatient way to|wards
England.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>UNCONSCIOUS of the good that awaited
him, and dreading the evil that might be irre|parable,
Willoughby landed at Brighthelm|&s;tone
from Dieppe. Though it was eleven
o'clock when he got on &s;hore, he ordered
po&s;t-hor&s;es to be in&s;tantly ready; and u&s;ed
the moment he waited for them to take a &s;light
refre&s;hment. On the table of the room he
was in, a new&s;paper lay&mdash;it was long &s;ince he
had &s;een an Engli&s;h new&s;paper&mdash;and he took
it up, where the fir&s;t article that &s;truck him
was an account of the funeral of Lord Ca&s;tle|north,
after his having lain in &s;tate at his
hou&s;e in town.</P>
<P>Willoughby felt an immediate impre&s;&s;ion
of concern for his uncle, and feared le&s;t di&s;|appointment
&s;hould have ha&s;tened his death.
<PB N="319" REF="321">
On him&s;elf. or any advantage he might derive
from the event, he never be&s;towed a thought;
but as the mind, under the influence of any
predominant pa&s;&s;ion, returns immediately to
its bias, however temporally diverted from it,
it almo&s;t in&s;tantly occurred to him, that if his
uncle had been &s;o long dead without his
knowing it, Cele&s;tina might po&s;&s;ibly have
been as long married. Trembling, he looked
among the marriages, but there were no
names there at all re&s;embling tho&s;e which he
dreaded to &s;ee united.&mdash;His chai&s;e was ready,
and he departed for London; for it was there
only that he was likely to gain intelligence of
Lady Horatia Howard, and he knew of no
other clue to guide him to Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had left Cheltenham with her
friend, and was now at Exmouth, where Mon|tague
Thorold was continually with them.&mdash;Whether
he was pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, Cele&s;tina
was equally pen&s;ive and melancholy; but it
was only in the latter ca&s;e, that &s;he attempted
to indulge tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations in the &s;olitary walks
which the &s;ea-&s;hore afforded her: for &s;he
avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible being quite alone
with him, becau&s;e her heart every day con|firmed
<PB N="320" REF="322">
her in the opinion that &s;he never could
love another man as &s;he had loved Willough|by,
and it was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to her to be fre|quently
under the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating, what
it inflicted &s;uch pain on her impa&s;&s;ioned and
indefatigable lover to hear. It was now late
in September: the evenings &s;oon &s;hut in; and,
when there happened not to be a &s;upply of
new books, Lady Horatia often engaged
Montague Thorold at piquet, while Cele&s;tina
&s;at by them at work; or, if &s;he could be &s;ure
he was &s;o occupied as not to be able to fol|low
her, &s;he walked out alone, and as the
moon trembled on the waves, recollected the
nights when, with Willoughby and Matilda, in
the early days of their innocent friend&s;hip,
they u&s;ed to mark and admire together this
beautiful appearance of the &s;ea illuminated by
the moon.&mdash;Here, on this very &s;pot, &s;he had
with him beheld it&mdash;The waves had now the
&s;ame trembling brilliancy; the &s;urrounding
objects were the &s;ame; but Willoughby was
changed: and happine&s;s and Cele&s;tina were,
&s;he thought, parted for ever.</P>
<P>Such were her contemplations one evening&punc;
when, towards the end of the month, and of
<PB N="321" REF="323">
Lady Horatia's intended &s;tay at the place, &s;he
left the company who were a&s;&s;embled at the
lodgings; and who happened to be the elder
Mr. Thorold, his wife, their &s;on Montague,
and Mr. and Mrs. Betten&s;on, who being on a
vi&s;it to the elder Mr. Thorold, when he was
ordered to the &s;ea for his health, had accom|panied
him all together to Exmouth, and were
&s;hewn every attention by Lady Horatia, as the
relations of her favourite Montague.</P>
<P>They were at cards; and Cele&s;tina, who
never played, took the opportunity of her ad|mirer's
being engaged at a whi&s;t table, from
which &s;he knew he could not immediately
e&s;cape, to go out&mdash;The wind was high, and
the &s;ea boi&s;terous; it was growing dark, and
&s;he fancied a particular gloom hung over every
object&mdash;&s;till, however, it was luxury to her
to be alone; &s;he was particularly wearied by
the conver&s;ation of Mr. Thorold; and found
nothing in that of Mrs. Betten&s;on to make her
amends: Betten&s;on was ignorant in&s;ipidity it|&s;elf;
and time, in&s;tead of adding to the num|ber
of his ideas, &s;eemed to have rendered him,
if po&s;&s;ible, more &s;tupid&mdash;Amid &s;uch &s;ociety,
&s;he could derive no plea&s;ure from the con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="322" REF="324">
of Mr. Thorold and Lady Horatia;
and the unu&s;ual weight &s;he felt on her &s;pirits
&s;eemed le&s;&s;ened, when &s;he could &s;igh at liberty&mdash;and
hear nothing around her but the wind,
or the &s;ea breaking again&s;t the &s;hore.</P>
<P>She had not, however, been out long, be|fore
the chill and gloomy appearance in|crea&s;ed;
and darkne&s;s coming on, &s;he &s;lowly
and reluctantly returned to the hou&s;e&mdash;She
heard, a little before &s;he quitted the road,
hor&s;es behind her; but not attending to them,
&s;he did not even di&s;tingui&s;h whether they were
the hor&s;es of the people of the place, or tho&s;e
of travellers. She entered the parlour, and
&s;at down by the card table, where Montague
Thorold, having performed his evening's ta&s;k,
had ju&s;t re&s;igned his place to Mr. Betten&s;on.
Suddenly a voice was heard in the pa&s;&s;age,
enquiring for Lady Horatia Howard of her
&s;ervant&mdash;"My lady is within, Sir," replied the
man&mdash;"And who are with her"&mdash;"Mr. and
Mrs. Thorold, and"&mdash;The &s;ervant was
going on&mdash;when the enquirer &s;aid vehemently&mdash;"It
is enough&mdash;let me however &s;ee them."
Cele&s;tina, at the fir&s;t &s;ound of this voice, had
&s;tarted from her chair&mdash;The &s;econd &s;entence
<PB N="323" REF="325">
it uttered affected her &s;till more; but &s;he had
no time to an&s;wer the eager enquiry of Mon|tague
Thorold&mdash;"What is the matter?"&mdash;before
the parlour door opened; and pale,
breathle&s;s&mdash;with an expre&s;&s;ion to which only
the pencil can do ju&s;tice, &s;he &s;aw before her
the figure of Willoughby.</P>
<P>There was agony and de&s;peration in his
looks. He ga&s;ped&mdash;he would have &s;poken,
but could not. The company all ro&s;e in &s;i|lence.
Lady Horatia, who hardly knew him
even by &s;ight, looked at Cele&s;tina for an ex|planation,
which &s;he was unable to give&mdash;At
length Willoughby, as if by an effort of pa&s;|&s;ionate
phrenzy, approached Cele&s;tina&mdash;and
&s;aid, in a hurried and inarticulate way, "I
would &s;peak to you, Madam&mdash;though&mdash;to&mdash;this
gentleman, I &s;uppo&s;e," and he turned to
Montague Thorold, "I mu&s;t apply for per|mi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>His manner, his look, as wildly he ca&s;t his
eyes around and &s;aw all the family of the
Thorolds a&s;&s;embled, which confirmed his idea
of her being married, contributed to over|whelm
Cele&s;tina with terror and amazement.
She no more doubted of his marriage with his
<PB N="324" REF="326">
cou&s;in, than he did of hers; and could not
conjecture why he came, or why he looked
&s;o little in his &s;en&s;es&mdash;She &s;at down&mdash;for her
limbs refu&s;ed to &s;upport her&mdash;and faintly
&s;aid, or rather tried to &s;ay, "I hope I &s;ee Mr.
Willoughby well."</P>
<P>Lady Horatia then addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to him&mdash;de&s;ired
him to take a chair, and to do her
the honour of &s;taying &s;upper with her.&mdash;He
heard or heeded her not&mdash;but, with fixed eyes,
gazing on Cele&s;tina, he &s;truck his hands to|gether,
and cried&mdash;while the violence of his
emotion choaked him.&mdash;"It is all over then&mdash;I
have lo&s;t her&mdash;and have nothing to do
here&mdash;No, by heaven, I cannot bear it"&mdash;He
then turned away, and left the room as ha&s;tily
as lie had entered it.</P>
<P>"My dear Cele&s;tina," cried Lady Hora|tia,
"what does all this mean? Do, Mr.
Montague&mdash;for Mi&s;s De Mornay is, I &s;ee,
much alarmed&mdash;Do, &s;peak to Mr. Willoughby&mdash;I
am really concerned to &s;ee him in &s;uch
a &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"No;" &s;aid Cele&s;tina, who would not for
the world have had Montague Thorold follow
him&mdash;"No; I will go my&s;elf after him"&mdash;
<PB N="325" REF="327">
Her fears now gave her re&s;olution, and with|out
heeding Montague Thorold, who would
have prevented her, &s;he hurried after Wil|loughby,
and overtook him ju&s;t as he was
quitting the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"Dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "dear Willoughby!"&mdash;At
tho&s;e well known &s;ounds, once &s;o pre|cious
to him, he turned round&mdash;She took his
hand&mdash;"I am very &s;orry to &s;ee you," continu|ed
&s;he, "in &s;uch agitations of &s;pirits&mdash;I greatly
fear&mdash;perhaps&mdash;" &s;ome mi&s;ery between him
and his &s;uppo&s;ed wife occurred to her&mdash;"I
am afraid &s;omething is wrong&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Wrong!" cried he; "Wrong!&mdash;and
do you, Cele&s;tina, inhuman Cele&s;tina, in&s;ult me
with &s;uch an enquiry?&mdash;Wrong!&mdash;am I not
the mo&s;t cur&s;ed of human beings?&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I hope not," interrupted &s;he&mdash;"for your
happine&s;s"&mdash;She knew no longer what &s;he
meant to &s;ay; nor did he give her time to re|collect;
for, eagerly rivetting his eyes on her
face, and gra&s;ping her hands between his&mdash;he
cried&mdash;"My happine&s;s!&mdash;and what of
my happine&s;s? Is it not gone, lo&s;t, for ever&mdash;Have
you not de&s;troyed it?&mdash;Damnation and
di&s;traction&mdash;Why do I linger here?" He
<PB N="326" REF="328">
then plunged away, and ru&s;hed out of the
door, where Farnham waited with two po&s;t|hor&s;es&mdash;Cele&s;tina,
trembling, and attempting
to &s;top him, followed.</P>
<P>He tried, however, to mount his hor&s;e, but
could not: he de&s;i&s;ted, leaned again&s;t it, with
his arm over the &s;addle, and re&s;ting his head
on his arm: Farnham &s;poke, and Cele&s;tina
immediately recollected him. "What is the
matter with your ma&s;ter, Farnham?" &s;aid &s;he,
"indeed he terrifies me to death!"&mdash;"Oh,
Ma'am," replied the hone&s;t fellow, &s;orrowfully,
"my poor ma&s;ter! Come, Sir," added he,
interrupted by a look of angui&s;h and horror
from Willoughby&mdash;"Come, dear Sir!&mdash;you
cannot ride any farther, I am per&s;uaded, to|night;
let me lead you to the inn." Wil|loughby,
without re&s;i&s;tance, &s;uffered Farnham
to lead him a &s;tep or two; but he waved with
his hand for Cele&s;tina to leave him, and faintly
&s;aid&mdash;"Go! go, Madam!&mdash;I wi&s;h you well!&mdash;I
wi&s;h you well!"&mdash;"Which is the way to
the inn?" cried Farnham.</P>
<P>"Not to the inn&mdash;do not go to the inn,"
exclaimed Cele&s;tina; "you are very ill, dear
Willoughby; let us take care of you here;
<PB N="327" REF="329">
Lady Horatia reque&s;ts it." Farnham led him
towards the door again; he leaned upon him,
and &s;ighed loudly and deeply. At length
he &s;aid, "I am a fool!&mdash;I came hither know|ing
all I know <HI>now,</HI> and ought to have been
better prepared for it. But I am better: let
me then execute my la&s;t re&s;olution, and bid
her one long, one eternal adieu."</P>
<P>There was a little vacant parlour near the
door; there Willoughby &s;at down. The &s;er|vants,
who were a&s;&s;embled, brought candles:
Cele&s;tina &s;tood &s;ilently by the table on which
they were placed; and Willoughby bid Farn|ham
leave the room.</P>
<P>A &s;hort &s;ilence en&s;ued. Willoughby &s;eemed
to be a&s;hamed of his weakne&s;s, and trying to
collect fortitude to bear like a man the cruelle&s;t
moment he had ever pa&s;t, he aro&s;e and ap|proached
Cele&s;tina, &s;aying in a low, grave,
and tremulous tone, "I have no right, Ma|dam,
to di&s;tre&s;s you&mdash;I have no ju&s;t cau&s;e of
complaint again&s;t you&mdash;I am very mi&s;erable&mdash;I
de&s;erve your pity&mdash;your prayers&mdash;I have
been deceived&mdash;you, I hope, will never have &s;o
much cau&s;e to regret it, as I mu&s;t have&mdash;you,
<PB N="328" REF="330">
I hope, are happy&mdash;will be happy."&mdash;He
could &s;ay no more, but put his hand on his
heart, and looked at Cele&s;tina with eyes &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of de&s;pair and grief, that all the ex|qui&s;ite
tenderne&s;s &s;he had ever felt for him re|turned
at once; &s;he forgot that he was (as
&s;he believed) the hu&s;band of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man;
but he was in a moment the beloved
Willoughby, the fir&s;t and only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of
her heart. She threw her arms around him,
and, &s;obbing on his bo&s;om, became almo&s;t
&s;en&s;ele&s;s from the violence and variety of emo|tions
that overwhelmed her.</P>
<P>He &s;hrunk, however, from her "Who is
it," &s;aid he, "gracious Heaven! that I thus
hold in my arms?&mdash;Not my Cele&s;tina, my own
Cele&s;tina; but the wife of another&mdash;Go, Ma|dam&mdash;I
entreat you leave me&mdash;Go, or phren|zy
may overtake me, and I may attempt im|po&s;&s;ibilities&mdash;to
tear you from your hu&s;band."
"Hu&s;band!" cried Cele&s;tina&mdash;"I have no
hu&s;band."&mdash;"Are you not married then?&mdash;not
married to Montague Thorold?"&mdash;"No
indeed&mdash;indeed, I am not."&mdash;"Not married&mdash;nor
intending to be married?"&mdash;"Neither, in|deed."&mdash;"And
you are at liberty, then, to be
<PB N="329" REF="331">
mine."&mdash;"I am, if you know that we ought
not to be divided."</P>
<P>Tho&s;e only who have loved like Willough|by,
and who, by a &s;udden tran&s;ition, are rai&s;ed
from the aby&s;s of de&s;pair to the height of fe|licity,
can imagine what he felt at that mo|ment.
If the fear of Cele&s;tina's being mar|ried,
had, for a moment, bereft him of rea|&s;on;
the certainty of her being not only free,
but as pa&s;&s;ionately attached to him as ever,
had, for a little time, an equally violent ef|fect.
Amid&s;t her own tran&s;ports, the extrava|gance
of his terrified her. There was a wild|ne&s;s
in his joy which made her tremble for his
intellects. But, after a moment, her &s;oft and
melting voice; the tender a&s;&s;urances &s;he gave
him, that &s;he lived only for him; that her
heart had never been e&s;tranged from him,
&s;oothed and &s;ubdued the tumult of his beating
heart. As his arms fondly encompa&s;&s;ed her;
as he re&s;ted his head on her bo&s;om, he &s;hed
tears of tender gratitude; his &s;pirits became
calmer, and the native &s;erene dignity of his
mind returned.</P>
<P>He was not, however, quite tranquil enough
to relate that night to Cele&s;tina the extraor|dinary
<PB N="330" REF="332">
&s;eries of events, which had led to the
enchanting certainty he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed&mdash;that
&s;he was not his &s;i&s;ter, but the daughter of
Lady Horatia's brother; that regretted bro|ther,
to who&s;e picture &s;he had &s;o great a re|&s;emblance.
The information, however, &s;uch
as in his pre&s;ent agitated &s;tate he was able to
give, convinced her, not only that the fatal
&s;uppo&s;ition of her being too nearly related to
Willoughby was for ever removed; but, that
&s;he was born of parents to whom it was ho|nourable
to belong: and that &s;he was nearly
allied by blood to her kind protectre&s;s.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired Lady Horatia might, be ac|quainted
with this. "Not to night," &s;aid
Willoughby&mdash;"I would to night &s;ee nobody
but you, my Cele&s;tina; hear no voice but
yours&mdash;to-morrow I will explain it all. But
now I <HI>feel</HI> my unexpected felicity too forcibly
to be able to talk about it."</P>
<P>He could not, however, determine to quit
Cele&s;tina; nor were either of them con&s;cious
of the cour&s;e of time, till Lady Horatia &s;ent to
let Cele&s;tina know &s;upper was ready, and to
beg the honour of Mr. Willoughby's com|pany.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="333">
It was then that Cele&s;tina prevailed upon
him to go from her, promi&s;ing to be ready to
walk with him by the dawn of the next morn|ing.
"And you mu&s;t go with me," &s;aid he,
"immediately to Alve&s;tone; for I will not
live another week without you." He then
recollected that Alve&s;tone might be &s;old; for
he had never heard from Cathcart &s;ince he
had given directions to have it di&s;po&s;ed of
He pau&s;ed a moment, and felt &s;ome unea&s;i|ne&s;s
in the reflection: but the happine&s;s he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was too great to allow him to feel
any concern long. He &s;miled, and added,
"If indeed Alve&s;tone is &s;till mine; and, if
it is not, my Cele&s;tina will <HI>create</HI> for me a pa|radi&s;e
wherever &s;he is."</P>
<P>"And wherever you are," replied &s;he,
while tears of tenderne&s;s filled her eyes, "Ce|le&s;tina
will <HI>find</HI> a paradi&s;e."</P>
<P>He then once more bade her good night&mdash;again
returned&mdash;and again bade her adieu.
"You are going now to rejoin the company,"
&s;aid he, "and there is Montague Thorold, of
whom, I know it is a weakne&s;s, I do not love
to think"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="334">
"It is indeed, Willoughby, a weakne&s;s un|worthy
of your generous heart; and, I hope,
what I can never have de&s;erved that you
&s;hould indulge."&mdash;"Well, well, my angel
I will not indulge it. But mu&s;t you &s;up with
them? They will fatigue you with que&s;tions&mdash;they
will di&s;tre&s;s you by enquiries." "No;
I had determined to &s;end an excu&s;e; for, in|deed,
my heart, yet wondering at its unex|pected
felicity, beats fearfully, and my trem|bling
nerves have unfitted me for conver|&s;ation."</P>
<P>At length Willoughby withdrew; and Ce|le&s;tina,
with a pencil, told Lady Horatia, who
waited the event of this extraordinary inter|view
in the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;u&s;pen&s;e, that &s;ome
extraordinary conver&s;ation with Mr. Wil|loughby
had agitated her &s;o much, that &s;he
could not return to the company, but mu&s;t
retire to her bed.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who was the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ted
of the party, had &s;uffered all the tor|tures
of anxious jealou&s;y while Cele&s;tina was
ab&s;ent. Every noi&s;e he heard in the pa&s;&s;age,
every time the door opened, he hoped &s;he was
<PB N="333" REF="335">
coming. She came not. He went out, not
to li&s;ten, but in hopes of meeting her. He
heard a low murmur of voices&mdash;the tones
were tho&s;e of tenderne&s;s&mdash;Willoughby then
was come to claim her: he was forgiven&mdash;and
he him&s;elf had lo&s;t all hope.&mdash;He return|ed
to the parlour, pale and dejected&mdash;his lips
trembled; his eyes were &s;till eagerly turned to
the door. He heard nothing that was &s;aid to
him; but unable to remain in his &s;eat, again
aro&s;e, went out, and returned. At length he
he heard the door of the parlour open, where
Willoughby and Cele&s;tina were&mdash;he li&s;tened
attentively&mdash;he heard her &s;ay, "Good night,
dear Willoughby." Willoughby &s;eemed, as
he an&s;wered, to ki&s;s her hand. Poor Thorold
could not bear it; but became more re&s;tle&s;s&mdash;again
went to the door&mdash;came back&mdash;opened
it to &s;ee if Cele&s;tina was coming&mdash;then helped
the &s;ervant to put the chairs round the &s;upper
table, without knowing what he was doing&mdash;and
&s;at down him&s;elf in one next to that
which he had placed for her. The &s;upper was
announced, but no Cele&s;tina appeared. At
length the &s;ervant brought in the note &s;he had
written. Lady Horatia read it, while poor
<PB N="334" REF="336">
Montague anxiou&s;ly followed her eyes. She
gave it to him acro&s;s the table: he ran it
over, and his &s;olicitude becoming in&s;upport|able:
he complained of being ill with the head|ach,
and de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to go to his
lodgings.</P>
<P>The eyes of his father were turned mourn|fully
towards him, as he went out of the room.
Mr. Thorold, however, did not &s;peak, but he
&s;ighed&mdash;and Lady Horatia under&s;tood him.
As for his wife, though &s;he had been extremely
aver&s;e to the thoughts of her &s;on's marrying
Cele&s;tina, while Cele&s;tina &s;eemed to be no
more than a rejected dependent on the Wil|loughby
family; yet now, &s;ince Lady Horatia
Howard had adopted her, &s;he appeared to be
altogether as fond of the connection&mdash;&s;o
ea&s;ily are minds like her's changed by adven|titious
circum&s;tances, and influenced by &s;ounds.
The notice Lady Horatia took of her, and her
daughter Betten&s;on, delighted and elated
her; rendering her &s;o di&s;gu&s;tingly civil, that
only the regard Lady Horatia felt for Mr.
Thorold and Montague, would have induced
her to &s;upport the awkward and offen&s;ive
adulation of Mrs. Thorold.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="337">
The lady of the hou&s;e was &s;o anxious about
Cele&s;tina, that only her general politene&s;s, or
what is u&s;ually termed, l'u&s;age du monde, en|abled
her to acquit her&s;elf in the u&s;ual forms
towards her gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;upper was &s;hort and dull&mdash;the con|ver&s;ation
being divided between Captain Bet|ten&s;on,
who related a long &s;tory of a duel be|tween
Jack Mar&s;ham, of his regiment, and
one Mr. Abber&s;ley, an en&s;ign in the &s;even|teenth;
the merits of which nobody under|&s;tood&mdash;and
for the event of which, nobody
cared&mdash;and Mrs. Thorold, who de&s;cribed a
dinner and ball given at Exeter, the week be|fore,
by a banker of that place, on occa&s;ion of
his daughter's marriage. With the termina|tion
of the&s;e di&s;&s;ertations, the &s;upper ended;
and Mr. Thorold, who had long been unea&s;y
and impatient, withdrew with his family.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia then ha&s;tened to the chamber
of Cele&s;tina; &s;he was ju&s;t in bed&mdash;but knowing
who it was tapped at the door, begged her to
Come in:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, my dear child," &s;aid Lady Horatia,
"and what is all this? I am impatient to
know."&mdash;"And I, Madam, impatient to re|late,
<PB N="336" REF="338">
though this evening I am quite unable to
undertake it, all the extraordinary circum|&s;tances
recounted to me by Willoughby."
"You are then related to him?" "No, thank
Heaven, I am not&mdash;I thank Heaven too, that
I am related to you." "To me?" Cele&s;tina
then gave a brief account of her birth, and the
way by which Willoughby had learnt tho&s;e
particulars he had recounted: Lady Horatia
embraced her with tears of rapture. Every
circum&s;tance &s;he recollected of her brother's
vi&s;its to France, confirmed the truth of Wil|loughby's
&s;tory; and &s;he very perfectly recol|lected
the de&s;ponding &s;tate of mind in which
he went to America, after his la&s;t return from
thence. His impri&s;onment for a few weeks in
the Ba&s;tile, which was imputed to &s;ome indi&s;cretion,
and that he him&s;elf never otherwi&s;e
explained&mdash;exactly corre&s;ponded with what
the Count de Bellegarde had related. But
while every concurrent, te&s;timony evinced
the truth of that narrative, Lady Horatia
could not account for her brother's never
having mentioned his marriage, or his daugh|ter.&mdash;"Perhaps,
however," &s;aid &s;he, "he
might have rea&s;ons for this, which I cannot
<PB N="337" REF="339">
penetrate. My father was har&s;h, ob&s;tinate,
and avaricious; and always expected Ormond
would marry as his elder brother did, to ag|grandize
his family&mdash;this he u&s;ed frequently
to be teazed to do, but always refu&s;ed&mdash;and
for &s;ome years, his di&s;po&s;ition retained nothing
of its former vivacity, but an ardour for war,
in which he &s;eemed, I often told him, de&s;irous
rather of death than of promotion: and he
an&s;wered me more than once, "That I gue&s;&s;ed
right&mdash;for that he was weary of life." I own,
I not unfrequently &s;u&s;pected, that &s;ome unfor|tunate
attachment had &s;o &s;haded his natural
gay and vigorous mind, with gloomy depre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I
have told him &s;o&mdash;and he has replied,
"That whatever might have been the ca&s;e, he
had no attachment then."</P>
<P>At length, as Cele&s;tina extremely needed
repo&s;e, Lady Horatia left her, reflecting, with
infinite delight, on the kindne&s;s &s;he had &s;hewn
her, as an orphan and a &s;tranger, while &s;he
had, in fact, been protecting the daughter of
her beloved brother. With plea&s;ure too &s;he
now thought of Willoughby, &s;ince Cele&s;tina's
happine&s;s was to be re&s;tored by her union with
him. But poor Montague Thorold, de|jected
<PB N="338" REF="340">
and in de&s;pair, relinqui&s;hing all tho&s;e
charming hopes, which, with more pity than
prudence, &s;he had her&s;elf encouraged him to
cheri&s;h pre&s;ented him&s;elf to her imagination,
and greatly abated the &s;atisfaction, with which
&s;he thought of the approaching felicity of
Willoughby and her neice.</P>
<P>She determined, however, to mitigate, as
much as &s;he could, the force of this cruel blow&mdash;and,
early the next morning, while Cele&s;|tina
was walking with the happy and enrap|tured
Willoughby, &s;he &s;ent for the elder Mr.
Thorold, and related to him all &s;he had learned
from Cele&s;tina the evening before.</P>
<P>"I now blame my&s;elf, my good friend,"
&s;aid &s;he, "for the part I have taken&mdash;but who
could fore&s;ee this?&mdash;Yet, I own, I fear the
con&s;equences, and heartily wi&s;h I had never
given &s;o many opportunities to your &s;on, of
contemplating tho&s;e perfections of mind and
per&s;on, which he will never, I fear, be able to
forget."</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold knew too well that this ob|&s;ervation
was ju&s;t&mdash;and dreaded, le&s;t the: lo&s;s
even of rea&s;on it&s;elf &s;hould be the con&s;equence
of Cele&s;tina's marriage&mdash;he returned home,
<PB N="339" REF="341">
however, immediately, to relate to Montague
the probability there was, that this event would
immediately happen. But, however tenderly
he communicated &s;uch fatal intelligence, he
found his &s;on more affected by it, than even
his paternal fears had repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>A &s;ilent and heavy de&s;pondence took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of him. He neither complained of,
nor reproached any one&mdash;but per&s;i&s;ted in &s;ay|ing,
that he would fee Cele&s;tina&mdash;take a la&s;t
leave of her, and then try to reconcile him&s;elf
to his fate.</P>
<P>But in his manner of &s;aying this, there, was
&s;omething more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to his father, than
he would have felt from the wilde&s;t ravings of
de&s;pair&mdash;he entreated him to relinqui&s;h his
project of &s;eeing Cele&s;tina.&mdash;"Why &s;hould
you &s;ee her, Montague," &s;aid he; "to what
purpo&s;e?&mdash;You own, that while Willoughby
was in que&s;tion, you entertained no hope&mdash;That
Cele&s;tina has never afforded you any
&s;ince; but that in &s;pite of her a&s;&s;urances that
&s;he could never feel a &s;econd attachment&mdash;that
you have per&s;evered, and <HI>taken</HI> that hope
which &s;he refu&s;ed to give&mdash;you have no one,
therefore, to blame; and if you have &s;ought
<PB N="340" REF="342">
pain, you mu&s;t learn to bear it. But after all that
has pa&s;&s;ed, I cannot con&s;ent to your inflicting
it on Cele&s;tina, or hazarding the po&s;&s;ibility of
giving unea&s;ine&s;s to her hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;band!" cried Montague Thorold&mdash;"he
is not her hu&s;band yet&mdash;but if he were&mdash;can
my humble adoration offend him&mdash;when I
mean to bid her an everla&s;tingadieu?&mdash;She will
con&s;ole my &s;ick heart by tender pity&mdash;She will
bid me be at peace&mdash;and I may try then to
obey her&mdash;The &s;ound of her voice is to me &s;o
&s;oothing&mdash;that if &s;he does not refu&s;e it, I mu&s;t
hear it once more &s;peak to me in accents of
kindne&s;s."</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold, finding every thing he could
&s;ay to di&s;&s;uade Montague from indulging this
unhappy inclination quite ineffectual, became
extremely unea&s;y; and dreaded, le&s;t &s;ome
alarming con&s;equence &s;hould ari&s;e from an in|terview,
which he thought Willoughby could
not approve, even if it were rea&s;onable or
proper in his &s;on to a&s;k it.</P>
<P>But Willoughby, now perfectly &s;ecure of
the affections of Cele&s;tina, was too generous,
and too noble-minded, not to feel pity for his
unfortunate rival. His own happine&s;s, great
<PB N="341" REF="343">
as it was, would have been more complete, if
he could have believed Montague Thorold le&s;s
unhappy.&mdash;"Would to Heaven," &s;aid he,
as he &s;poke of him to Cele&s;tina, "Would to
Heaven that he could &s;ee Anzoletta, and
transfer to her that affection, which, while it
is fixed on you, can &s;erve only to render him
mi&s;erable."&mdash;Cele&s;tina joined mo&s;t cordially
in this wi&s;h.&mdash;"He de&s;erves to be happy, I
believe," &s;aid &s;he; "and the de&s;ire you ex|pre&s;s
to &s;ee him &s;o, is worthy of the heart of
my Willoughby."</P>
<P>But however liberal and rea&s;onable Wil|loughby
was in regard to a competitor, from
whom, though he had &s;uffered much, he had
now nothing to fear; he was not &s;o patient
under any circum&s;tance that was likely to
impede his union with Cele&s;tina.&mdash;All that
&s;he or Lady Horatia could urge to him on the
propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;hort delay, for
preparations and forms, he treated as ridicu|lous&mdash;and
&s;o vehemently in&s;i&s;ted on the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of fulfilling the promi&s;e he had made
to the Count de Bellegarde, at parting with
him, to return to him immediately with Ce|le&s;tina
as his wife&mdash;that their oppo&s;ition was
<PB N="342" REF="344">
to little purpo&s;e.&mdash;So totally engro&s;&s;ed, how|ever,
had Willoughby been by his fears le&s;t
Cele&s;tina might be lo&s;t to him, that he did not
even know whether he had a hou&s;e to take her
to&mdash;but, as with him, all places were alike to
her, he &s;ent an expre&s;s that morning to Cath|cart,
informing him, that he &s;hould be at
Exeter the next day with Cele&s;tina, de&s;iring
him to meet him there with Je&s;&s;y, and to go
with them to Alve&s;tone, if Alve&s;tone was yet
in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He di&s;patched another me&s;&s;enger to Lon|don
for a &s;pecial licence to be married at Al|ve&s;tone,
or Exeter; and obviating every re|maining
&s;eruple, he prevailed on Cele&s;tina to
&s;et out with him that evening for the latter
place, with the con&s;ent of Lady Horatia, who
promi&s;ed to follow them in a few days.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance was &s;o &s;hort, that though it
was late in the day, after Willoughby's arri|val
at Exmouth, before this was determined
upon, they were at Exeter by &s;even in the
evening; and in an hour afterwards, Cathcart
and Je&s;&s;y arrived al&s;o.</P>
<P>Cathcart not only informed Willoughby
that his e&s;tate was &s;till his, but put into hands
<PB N="343" REF="345">
tho&s;e letters that brought the intelligence of
that acqui&s;ition of fortune which came by the
death of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth.&mdash;The &s;atisfaction
of this intelligence, the plea&s;ure of meeting
Cathcart and Je&s;&s;y, who were overwhelmed
with joy to &s;ee them&mdash;the certainty of return|ing
together to a place they both &s;o fondly
loved, &s;eemed to complete the happine&s;s of
the long divided lovers.&mdash;Early the next
morning they reached Alve&s;tone, where, in
the ab&s;ence of Mr. Thorold, his curate joined
the hands of Willoughby and Cele&s;tina, above
eighteen months after that period, when they
believed them&s;elves &s;eparated for ever.</P>
<P>In three days Lady Horatia arrived at Al|ve&s;tone;
and the additional plea&s;ure her com|pany
gave them, was checked only by the ac|count
&s;he gave of the &s;ituation of Montague
Thorold&mdash;who not having been allowed to &s;ee
Cele&s;tina, the time of who&s;e departure from
Exmouth had been indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed
from him, had &s;unk into &s;uch a &s;tate of de&s;|pondence,
as made his father tremble for his
rea&s;on, if not for his life.</P>
<P>For Vava&s;our too, whom Willoughby had
always loved, he could not help feeling con|cern.
<PB N="344" REF="346">
&mdash;He knew not whither to direct to him;
but from all the accounts he was able to gain,
he feared that all the good qualities of his
heart and under&s;tanding were ob&s;cured, if not
de&s;troyed, by the di&s;&s;olute &s;tile of life into
which he had plunged with &s;uch avidity,
&s;ince their la&s;t parting.&mdash;He endeavoured,
however, to counteract the impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e
only alloys to &s;upreme happine&s;s, by reflecting
on the probable felicity of other friends, and
particularly of the Count of Bellegarde; from
whom, ten days after his marriage, he re|ceived
a letter, informing him, that he was
then going to Perpignan; empowered to re|lea&s;e
his wife from her convent&mdash;and that they
&s;hould go, together with their Anzoletta, im|mediately
to Rochemarte&mdash;where he be&s;ought
Willoughby to rejoin him, with Cele&s;tina&mdash;promi&s;ing,
that if he would do &s;o, they would
return with him, and pa&s;s the winter all toge|ther
in England.</P>
<P>Though it was now late in the year, and
though Cele&s;tina would have preferred re|maining
at Alve&s;tone, where &s;he had fixed all
her ideas of happine&s;s, yet the wi&s;hes of her
uncle, and the melancholy &s;atisfaction of vi|&s;iting
<PB N="345" REF="347">
the place where her mother had lived&mdash;and
where &s;he died a victim to parental har&s;h|ne&s;s,
and maternal grief; together with the
inclination Willoughby &s;hewed to gratify the
Count, and introduce his wife to him and
Anzoletta, determined her to make no ob|jection
to their immediate departure.&mdash;There
was, indeed, no time to lo&s;e; as the winter
was &s;o near.&mdash;Lady Horatia too, who waited
impatiently an interview with Mon&s;ieur de
Bellegarde, though &s;he had not health to un|dertake
&s;uch a journey, ha&s;tened them as
much as po&s;&s;ible; and in &s;omething le&s;s than a
month after Willoughby called Cele&s;tina his,
he pre&s;ented her, at Rochemarte, to her uncle
de Bellegarde, to Jacquelina, and Anzoletta.
To the two former &s;he appeared the precious
repre&s;entative of their two beloved and re|gretted
friends; the tender recollection of
of whom, added to her own merit, made her
to them an object almo&s;t of adoration&mdash;while
Anzoletta loved her as a &s;i&s;ter, to whom &s;he
became more tenderly attached, from ta&s;te
and affection, than even that near tie of blood
alone could have attached her.</P>
<P>With what melancholy plea&s;ure did the
<PB N="346" REF="348">
Count tie round the neck of Cele&s;tina that
picture of her mother, which her father, as he
was dying, had taken from his own bo&s;om&mdash;with
an injunction, never to part with it, but
to his daughter.&mdash;And how many tears did
Cele&s;tina &s;hed, as, leaning on the arm of Wil|loughby,
he pointed out to her the &s;pot,
which the Count had &s;hewn him, as the grave
of Genevieve.&mdash;Willoughby ki&s;&s;ed tho&s;e tears
away, as they filled her eyes&mdash;and bade her
turn from the too frequent recollection of the
pa&s;t, to tho&s;e &s;cenes of future happine&s;s, which
love, friend&s;hip, and fortune, &s;eemed to be pre|paring
for them.</P>
<P>In the romantic and magnificent &s;cenes
round the ca&s;tle the poetical ta&s;te of Cele&s;tina
Was highly gratified. Willoughby took her
the &s;pot where he had been lo&s;t in the fortu|nate
night that eventually led him to the re|&s;idence
of the Count of Bellegarde. They
vi&s;ited together the humble cottage of Le
Laurier, who&s;e family they loaded with kind|ne&s;s;
and traced with her the &s;cenes which
were &s;o many years before witne&s;&s;es to the
clande&s;tine marriages of Genevieve and Jac|quelina.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349">
Winter, however, put an end to the&s;e ex|cur&s;ions
in the mountains; and the Count
de Bellegarde, having completed the &s;ettle|ment
of his affairs, agreed, at the earne&s;t re|que&s;t
of Willoughby and Cele&s;tina, to go with
his wife and daughter to England.</P>
<P>On their journey thither, they met at Paris
Captain and Mrs. Cavanaugh. They found
the former become a man of the utmo&s;t im|portance,
and arrogantly enjoying the &s;plen|dour
of his new &s;ituation, in a country where
he had appeared in one &s;o very different.
Mrs. Cavanaugh &s;eemed to affect being happy&mdash;and
to di&s;dain all &s;he had relinqui&s;hed to
obtain that happine&s;s her own way. But,
from &s;ome &s;trange caprice, &s;he now appeared
&s;o fond of Willoughby, that had Cele&s;tina
been liable to jealou&s;y&mdash;or had Cavanaugh
really cared for his wife, they might both, in
her manner, have found &s;ufficient cau&s;e of
di&s;content. Mrs. Cavanaugh related to Wil|loughby
all the artifices her mother had u&s;ed
to break off his marriage with Cele&s;tina; and
when he expre&s;&s;ed his wonder that Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth &s;hould go &s;uch lengths in an affair
in which her intere&s;t did not appear to be im|mediately
<PB N="348" REF="350">
or particularly concerned, &s;he an|&s;wered,
in her u&s;ual &s;neering way&mdash;"If you
could know my mother &s;o well as I do&mdash;but
it is impo&s;&s;ible by words to do her ju&s;tice&mdash;you
would no longer wonder. Her &s;cheme
lay much deeper than you were aware of."</P>
<P>Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, to con&s;ole her&s;elf for the
defection of Captain Cavanaugh, had taken,
as her travelling companion, a young Abb&eacute;,
who, di&s;contented with the prevailing politics
of his country, found in her at once an ad|mirer
of his per&s;on and character, and a &s;tre|nuous
&s;upporter of his ari&s;tocratic principles&mdash;and,
what was yet better than either, he found
him&s;elf &s;haring a fortune beyond what he had
ever dreamed of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. This well a&s;&s;orted
pair were at Bru&s;&s;eis&mdash;and Mrs. Cavanaugh
diverted her&s;elf with &s;ome &s;arca&s;tic remarks
on the Director cho&s;en by her mother&mdash;of
whom &s;he always &s;poke with a degree of ran|cour
which made Cele&s;tina tremble, while
Willoughby &s;huddered to recollect how near
he once was becoming the hu&s;band of one
who could thus expre&s;s her&s;elf towards her
mother.</P>
<P>Captain and Mrs. Cavanaugh were going
<PB N="349" REF="351">
to Italy.&mdash;The happy party, who took leave
of them, ha&s;tened to England, where, on their
arrival in London, Lady Horatia joined them,
and they were &s;oon fixed at Alve&s;tone, in &s;uch
perfect felicity as is &s;eldom enjoyed, and &s;till
more rarely de&s;erved.&mdash;The fir&s;t enquiry of
Cele&s;tina was for Mr. Thorold and his family.
She learned that Captain Thorold was the
great friend and favourite of Lady Molyneux,
with whom he was gone to Ireland to the di&s;|plea&s;ure
of his father, who had however no
influence over him, and who&s;e di&s;appointment
in his elde&s;t &s;on was embittered by the condi|tion
into which a hopele&s;s and incurable
pa&s;&s;ion had thrown the younge&s;t.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who could not reflect, without
great pain, on the unhappine&s;s with which
the days of her excellent friend were thus
over-clouded, took an early opportunity, after
her being &s;ettled at Alve&s;tone, to de&s;ire an
interview with the elder Mr. Thorold. He
came&mdash;and &s;he &s;aw with redoubled concern,
the ravage which anxiety had made on his
manly face and figure, even in a few &s;hort
months. He related to her, hardly refraining
from tears, the &s;ad change that had happened
<PB N="350" REF="352">
in the temper and talents of his &s;on&mdash;"I have
&s;ometimes thought," &s;aid he, "that you, my
dear Madam, and you only, can rou&s;e him
from the&s;e alienations of mind&mdash;I was aver&s;e
to his &s;eeing you before you went abroad&mdash;but
now I wi&s;h it: your rea&s;on may reconcile
him to his fate&mdash;you pity, &s;oothe him&mdash;or, be
the event of your meeting what it may, no
change can, I think, be for the wor&s;e." Ce|le&s;tina
promi&s;ed to &s;ee him&mdash;and his father
contrived, with her, the means of procuring
this interview; for Montague now &s;hunned
every body, and very frequently would not
appear, even to his own family.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina did not, however, mean to meet
him alone; but to &s;hew him, in Anzoletta,
beauty, under&s;tanding, and &s;weetne&s;s, with a
heart untouched by any former pa&s;&s;ion, and
worthy of his. Her generous intentions, &s;uc|ceeded.&mdash;Montague
Thorold, &s;truck with the
re&s;emblance between them, and particularly
with the voice of Anzoletta, was &s;oon as pa&s;|&s;ionately
attached to her, as a man could be,
who had once loved Cele&s;tina her&s;elf. The
Count of Bellegarde, who intended to be&s;tow
her, with her ample fortune, on an Engli&s;h|man,
<PB N="351" REF="353">
and a Prote&s;tant, he&s;itated not a moment,
in con&s;enting to an union which would, he
found, make his daughter happy; and, eight
months after the marriage of Willoughby and
Cele&s;tina, Anzoletta gave her hand, in the
chapel of Alve&s;tone, to Montague Thorold.</P>
<P>Willoughby had now but one wi&s;h unful|filled&mdash;for
every pecuniary difficulty, the mu|nificence
of the Count de Bellegarde, and the
legacy of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, had removed&mdash;and
this one wi&s;h was, to &s;ee Vava&s;our &s;uch
as a rea&s;onable being, with every rea&s;onable
means of happine&s;s in his power, ought to be.
But in this, as he had no &s;econd Anzoletta to
give him, and &s;hould have feared his want of
&s;teadine&s;s if he had, he almo&s;t de&s;paired of
being gratified.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, however, &s;ometimes vi&s;ited at
Alve&s;tone; and, unlike Montague Thorold,
he &s;eemed to have conquered his extravagant
pa&s;&s;ion for Cele&s;tina, &s;ince it was become
hopele&s;s. He had, unluckily for him, taken
up no permanent affection in its place; but
lo&s;t his health, and his fortune in pur&s;uits
which could not afford him even a temporary
<PB N="352" REF="354">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that happine&s;s for which he &s;till
declared him&s;elf to be in &s;earch.</P>
<P>When Cele&s;tina reflected on his kindne&s;s to
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and her children, who now
lived in comfort on the provi&s;ion he had made
for them; and on many other generous and
noble actions; &s;he could not but lament, with
Willoughby, that infelicity of which he con|tinually
complained, even amid his wilde&s;t and
mo&s;t determined per&s;everance in the career of
di&s;&s;olute plea&s;ure. But for this &s;ource of regret,
as there &s;eemed to be no remedy within her
power, &s;he did not &s;uffer it to embitter the
&s;atisfaction &s;he derived from almo&s;t every
other friend.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia no longer complained of that
tedium which, at the beginning of their ac|quaintance,
&s;eemed to have rendered life indif|ferent
to her. She had now, in Willoughby,
and his lovely wife, objects of her affection;
and hoped to grow old amid&s;t their children.
Mon&s;ieur and Madam de Bellegarde, were
more acutely &s;en&s;ible of their pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s,
from the poignancy of their pa&s;t afflic|tions;
and their daughter, the object of their
tender &s;olicitude, made the felicity of a worthy
<PB N="353" REF="355">
man, who de&s;erved the affection &s;he felt for
him. In Cathcart and Je&s;&s;y, Cele&s;tina beheld
the earlie&s;t objects of her beneficence&mdash;enjoy|ing
all that affluence and mutual tenderne&s;s
could be&s;tow&mdash;And the widowed heart of Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone was at ea&s;e, not only by her
own pre&s;ent independence, but from the a&s;|&s;urances
Willoughby had given her, of pro|viding
for her boys, as &s;oon as they were of
the age when they could be put to profe&s;&s;ions.
The elder Mr. Thorold, too, her venerable
and re&s;pectable friend, was re&s;tored to happi|ne&s;s,
in contemplating that of his &s;on: and
above all, Cele&s;tina beheld in Willoughby,
the be&s;t and mo&s;t affectionate of hu&s;bands&mdash;who&s;e
whole life was dedicated to the pur|po&s;e
of making her happy&mdash;and who&s;e only
apprehen&s;ion &s;eemed to be, that with all he
could do, he mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort of that
degree of merit towards either heaven or
earth, which that fortunate being ought to
po&s;&s;e&s;s, who was ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o lovely and
perfect a creature as Cele&s;tina.</P>
