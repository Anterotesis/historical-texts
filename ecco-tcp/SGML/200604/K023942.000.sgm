<P>_ONE of tho&s;e great Effects, which length of Time is &s;een to bring along with it, is the Alteration of the Meaning annexed to certain Sounds. The Signification of a Word, well known and under&s;tood by Tho&s;e who fir&s;t made u&s;e of it, is very in&s;en&s;ibly varied, by pa&s;&s;ing thr&ocirc; many Mouths, and by being taken and given by Multitudes, in common Di&s;cour&s;e; till it often comes to &s;tand for a Complication of Notions, as di&s;tant from the original Inten|tion of it, nay, as contradictory to it, as Darkne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="3">
is to Light. The Ignorance and Weak|ne&s;s of Some, and the Pa&s;&s;ions and Bad De&s;igns of Others, are the great In&s;truments of this Evil: which, even when it &s;eems to affect only indifferent Matters, ought in rea&s;on to be op|po&s;ed, as it tends in it's nature to confound Men's Notions in weightier Points; but, when it hath once invaded the mo&s;t Sacred and Im|portant Subjects, ought, in Duty, to be re&s;i&s;ted with a more open and undi&s;gui&s;ed Zeal, as what toucheth the very Vitals of all that is good, and is ju&s;t going to take from Men's Eyes the Boundaries of Right and Wrong.</P>
<P>The only Cure for this <HI>Evil,</HI> in Ca&s;es of &s;o great Concern, is to have recour&s;e to the Ori|ginals of Things: to the Law of Rea&s;on, in tho&s;e Points which can be traced back thither; and to the Declarations of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and his immediate Followers, in &s;uch Matters, as took their Ri&s;e &s;olely from tho&s;e Declarations. For the Ca&s;e is plainly this, that Words and Sounds have had &s;uch an Effect, (not upon the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Nature of Things, which is unmoveable, but) upon the Minds of Men in thinking of them; that the very &s;ame Word remaining, (which at fir&s;t truly repre&s;ented One certain Thing,) by having Multitudes of new incon&s;i&s;tent Ideas, in every Age, and every Year, added to it, becomes it &s;elf the greate&s;t Hindrance to the true under&s;tanding of the Nature of the Thing fir&s;t intended by it.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, <HI>Religion,</HI> in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Days, was Virtue and Integrity, as to our &s;elves, and Charity and Beneficence to others; before <HI>God,</HI> even the <HI>Father. Ja.</HI> i. 27. By Degrees, it is come to &s;ignify, in mo&s;t of the Countries throughout the whole World, the Performance of every thing almo&s;t, except Virtue and Charity; and particularly, a punctual Exactne&s;s in a Regard to particular <HI>Times, Places, Forms,</HI> and <HI>Modes,</HI> diver&s;ified according to the various Humours of Men; recommended and practi&s;ed under the avowed Name of <HI>External Religion: Two Words,</HI> which, in the Sen&s;e fix'd upon them by many Chri&s;tians, <HI>God hath put a&s;under</HI>; and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
which therefore, <HI>no Man &s;hould join together.</HI> And accordingly, the Notion of a <HI>Religious Man</HI> differs in every Country, ju&s;t as much as <HI>Times, Places, Ceremonies, Imaginary Au&s;terities,</HI> and all other <HI>Outward Circum&s;tances,</HI> are diffe|rent and various: Whereas in truth, th&ocirc; a Man, truly <HI>Religious</HI> in other Re&s;pects, may make u&s;e of &s;uch Things; yet, they can|not be the lea&s;t part of his <HI>Religion,</HI> properly &s;o call'd, any more than his Food, or his Rai|ment, or any other Circum&s;tance of his Life.</P>
<P>Thus likewi&s;e, the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> to be paid by Chri&s;tians, was, in <HI>our Saviour's</HI> time, and in his own plain Words, the Wor&s;hip of the Father <HI>in Spirit and Truth</HI>; and this de|clared to be one great End propo&s;ed in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation: The Hour cometh, and now is, when the true Wor&s;hippers &s;hall Wor&s;hip the Father in Spirit and in Truth: for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI> John iv. 23. But the <HI>Notion</HI> of it is become quite another thing: and in many <HI>Chri&s;tian Countries,</HI> that which
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;till retains the Name of the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> is indeed the Neglect, and the Diminution of the Father; and the Wor&s;hip of other Beings be&s;ides, and more than, the <HI>Father.</HI> And this, performed in &s;uch a manner, as that any <HI>indif|ferent Spectator</HI> would conclude, that neither the Con&s;ciences nor Under&s;tandings of Men, neither <HI>Spirit</HI> nor <HI>Truth</HI> were at all concerned in the Matter; or rather, that they had been bani&s;h'd from it by an expre&s;s Command. In the mean time the <HI>Word,</HI> or <HI>Sound,</HI> &s;till remains the &s;ame in Di&s;cour&s;e. The whole Lump of indige&s;ted, and incon&s;i&s;tent Notions and Pra|ctices; Every thing that is &s;olemnly &s;aid, or done, when the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is profe&s;s'd, is equally cover'd under that <HI>general Name</HI>; and, by the help of u&s;ing the &s;ame <HI>Original Word,</HI> pa&s;&s;eth ea&s;ily for the <HI>Thing</HI> it &s;elf. Again,</P>
<P><HI>Prayer,</HI> in all our <HI>Lord</HI>'s Directions about it, and particularly in that <HI>Form,</HI> which He him&s;elf taught his Followers, was a calm, un|di&s;turbed, <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> under the Notion of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
a <HI>Father,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Sentiments and Wi&s;hes before Him, which every &s;incere Mind ought to have. But the &s;ame <HI>Word,</HI> by the help of Men, and voluminous Rules of Art, is come to &s;ignify <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Flame,</HI> in &s;uch a manner, and to &s;uch a degree, that a Man may be in the <HI>be&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> in the World, and yet not be <HI>devout</HI> enough to <HI>Pray:</HI> and many an hone&s;t Per&s;on hat been perplex'd, by this Means, with Doubts and Fears of being uncapable of <HI>Praying,</HI> for want of an <HI>inten&s;ene&s;s</HI> of <HI>Heat,</HI> which hath no more relation to the Duty, than a Man's being in a <HI>Fever</HI> hath, to the Sincerity of his Profe&s;&s;ions, or Addre&s;&s;es to any <HI>Earthly Prince.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, the <HI>Love of God,</HI> and of <HI>our Saviour,</HI> was at fir&s;t, in his own Words, and tho&s;e of St. <HI>John,</HI> many times repeated, the <HI>keeping his Commandments, or doing his Will.</HI> Joh. 14. 15, 21, 23. <HI>ch.</HI> 15. 10. I Joh. 2. 5. <HI>ch.</HI> 5. 3. II <HI>Joh.</HI> 6. But the <HI>Notion</HI> of it was, it &s;eems, left very jejune; and &s;o hath been improved
<PB N="9" REF="8">
by his <HI>later Followers,</HI> till the &s;ame <HI>Name,</HI> &s;till kept up in the Language of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> is far re|moved from the <HI>Thing</HI> principally and fir&s;t in|tended; and is come by degrees to &s;ignify a violent <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion, Commotion,</HI> and <HI>Ec&s;ta&s;y,</HI> vent|ing it &s;elf in &s;uch &s;ort of Expre&s;&s;ions and Di&s;|orders, as other <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> do: and this regulated and defined, by &s;uch a Variety of Imaginati|ons, that an ordinary <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> with the ut|mo&s;t Sincerity in his Heart, is filled with no|thing but eternal Su&s;picions, Doubts, and Perplexities, whether he hath any thing of the true <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or not.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the&s;e <HI>Particulars,</HI> not only to &s;hew the Evil it &s;elf; and to how great a Degree the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things hath &s;uffered in the Opinions of Men, by the Alteration of the Sen&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Sounds:</HI> but to give you Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that there can be no Cure for it, in <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but to go back to the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> it &s;elf; becau&s;e <HI>there</HI> alone we &s;hall find the Original Intention of &s;uch Words;
<PB N="10" REF="9">
or the Nature of the Things de&s;ign'd to be &s;ig|nified by them, declared and fixed by our <HI>Lord,</HI> or his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> from him, by &s;ome &s;uch Marks, as may, if we will attend to them, guide and guard us in our Notions of tho&s;e Matters, in which we are mo&s;t of all concern'd.</P>
<P>It is with this View, that I have cho&s;en tho&s;e <HI>Words,</HI> in which our <HI>Lord</HI> him&s;elf decla|red the Nature of <HI>his own Kingdom.</HI> This <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is the &s;ame with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> And the <HI>Notion</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which, at fir&s;t, was only the Number, &s;mall or great, of Tho&s;e who believed <HI>Him</HI> to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; or of Tho&s;e who &s;ubjected them&s;elves to <HI>Him,</HI> as their <HI>King,</HI> in the Affair of <HI>Religion</HI>; having &s;ince that Time been &s;o diver&s;ified by the various <HI>Alterations</HI> it hath undergone, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible &s;o much as to number up the many <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent Images</HI> that have come, by daily Additions, to be united together in it: nothing, I think, can be more u&s;eful, than to con&s;ider the &s;ame thing,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
under &s;ome other <HI>Image,</HI> which hath not been &s;o much u&s;ed; nor con&s;equently &s;o much defa|ced. And &s;ince the <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>His Kingdom,</HI> is <HI>That</HI> under which our Lord him&s;elf cho&s;e to repre|&s;ent it: We may be &s;ure that, if we &s;incerely examine our Notion of his <HI>Church,</HI> by what He &s;aith of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> that <HI>it is not of this World,</HI> we &s;hall exclude out of it, every thing that he would have excluded; and then, what remains will be true, pure, and uncorrupted. And what I have to &s;ay, in order to this, will be comprehended under Two <HI>General Heads.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. As the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t, He</HI> him&s;elf is <HI>King:</HI> and in this; it is implied, that <HI>He</HI> is him&s;elf the &s;ole <HI>Law-giver</HI> to his <HI>Subjects,</HI> and him&s;elf the &s;ole <HI>Judge</HI> of their <HI>Behaviour,</HI> in the Affairs of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Eternal Salvation.</HI> And in this Sen&s;e therefore, <HI>His Kingdom is not of this World</HI>; that He hath, in tho&s;e Points, left behind Him, no vi&s;ible, humane <HI>Authority</HI>; no <HI>Vicegerents,</HI> who can be &s;aid pro|perly to &s;upply his Place; no <HI>Interpreters,</HI> upon
<PB N="12" REF="11">
whom his Subjects are ab&s;olutely to depend; no <HI>Judges</HI> over the Con&s;ciences or Religion of his People. For if this were &s;o, that any &s;uch ab&s;o|lute <HI>Vicegerent Authority,</HI> either for the making <HI>new Laws,</HI> or interpreting <HI>Old</HI> Ones, or <HI>judging</HI> his <HI>Subjects,</HI> in <HI>Religious</HI> Matters, were lodged in any Men upon Earth; the Con&s;equence would be, that what &s;till retains the Name of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> would not be the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> but the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of tho&s;e Men, ve&s;ted with &s;uch <HI>Authority.</HI> For, whoever hath &s;uch an <HI>Authority</HI> of making Laws, is &s;o far a <HI>King:</HI> and whoever can add new Laws to tho&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> equally obligatory, is as truly a <HI>King,</HI> as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf is: Nay, whoever hath an <HI>ab&s;o|lute Authority</HI> to <HI>interpret</HI> any written, or &s;poken Laws; it is <HI>He,</HI> who is truly the <HI>Law-giver,</HI> to all Intents and Purpo&s;es; and not the Per&s;on who fir&s;t wrote, or &s;poke them.</P>
<P>In humane Society, the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of <HI>Laws</HI> may, of nece&s;&s;ity, be lodged, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, in the Hands of Tho&s;e who were not originally
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the <HI>Legi&s;lators.</HI> But this is not <HI>ab&s;olute</HI>; (nor of bad Con&s;equence to <HI>Society:</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Le|gi&s;lators</HI> can re&s;ume the <HI>Interpretation</HI> into their own Hands, as they are Witne&s;&s;es to what pa&s;&s;es in the World; and as They can, and will, &s;en&s;ibly interpo&s;e in all tho&s;e Ca&s;es, in which their Interpo&s;ition becomes nece&s;&s;ary. And therefore, They are &s;till properly the <HI>Legi&s;lators.</HI> But it is otherwi&s;e in <HI>Religion,</HI> or the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> He him&s;elf never interpo&s;eth, &s;ince his fir&s;t Promulgation of his <HI>Law,</HI> either to convey <HI>Infallibility</HI> to Such as pretend to handle it over again; or to a&s;&s;ert the true <HI>Interpretation</HI> of it, amid&s;t the various and contradictory Opi|nions of Men about it. If <HI>He</HI> did certainly thus interpo&s;e, He him&s;elf would &s;till be the <HI>Legi&s;la|tor.</HI> But, as <HI>He</HI> doth not; if &s;uch an ab&s;olute <HI>Authority</HI> be once lodged with Men, under the Notion of <HI>Interpreters, They</HI> then become the <HI>Legi&s;lators,</HI> and not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and <HI>They</HI> rule in their own <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and not in <HI>His.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
It is the &s;ame thing, as to Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments, to carry forward the great End of his <HI>Kingdom.</HI> If any Men upon Earth have a <HI>Right</HI> to add to the <HI>Sanctions</HI> of his <HI>Laws</HI>; that is, to increa&s;e the Number, or alter the Nature, of the <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> of his Subjects, in Matters of Con&s;cience, or Sal|vation: They are &s;o far <HI>Kings</HI> in his &s;tead; and Reign in <HI>their own</HI> Kingdom, and not in <HI>His.</HI> So it is, whenever They erect <HI>Tribunals,</HI> and exerci&s;e a <HI>Judgment</HI> over the Con&s;ciences of Men; and a&s;&s;ume to Them&s;elves the Determination of &s;uch Points, as cannot be determined, but by <HI>One</HI> who knows the Hearts; or, when They make any of their own Declarations, or Deci&s;ions, to concern and affect the State of Chri&s;t's Sub|jects, with regard to the Favour of God: this is &s;o far, the taking <HI>Chri&s;t's Kingdom</HI> out of <HI>His</HI> Hands, and placing it in their own.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Nor is this matter at all made better by their declaring Them&s;elves to be <HI>Vice-gerents,</HI> or <HI>Law-makers,</HI> or <HI>Judges,</HI> under <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in order to carry on the Ends of his Kingdom. For it comes to this at la&s;t, &s;ince it doth not &s;eem fit to Chri&s;t him&s;elf to interpo&s;e &s;o as to prevent or remedy all their mi&s;takes and contradictions, that, if They have this power of interpreting, or adding, Laws, and judging Men, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;hall be indi&s;pen&s;ably and ab&s;olutely obliged to obey tho&s;e <HI>Laws,</HI> and to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e <HI>Deci&s;ions</HI>; I &s;ay, if They have this power lodged with them, then the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in which They rule, is not the Kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but of <HI>Them&s;elves</HI>; <HI>He</HI> doth not rule in it, but <HI>They:</HI> And, whether They hap|pen to agree with Him, or to differ from Him, as long as They are the <HI>Law-givers,</HI> and <HI>Jud|ges,</HI> without any Interpo&s;ition from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> either to guide or correct their <HI>Deci&s;ions, They</HI> are <HI>Kings</HI> of this <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and not <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>If therefore, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be the <HI>King|dom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> it is e&s;&s;ential to it, That <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf
<PB N="16" REF="15">
be the Sole <HI>Law-giver,</HI> and Sole <HI>Judge</HI> of his Subjects, in all points relating to the favour or di&s;plea&s;ure of <HI>Almighty God</HI>; and that All His <HI>Subjects,</HI> in what Station &s;oever They may be, are equally <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>Him</HI>; and that No One of them, any more than Another, hath <HI>Authority,</HI> either to make <HI>New Laws</HI> for <HI>Christ's</HI> Subjects; or to impo&s;e a &s;en&s;e upon the <HI>Old</HI> Ones, which is the &s;ame thing; or to <HI>Judge,</HI> Cen&s;ure, or Puni&s;h, the Servants of <HI>Another Master,</HI> in matters relating purely to <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> or <HI>Salvation.</HI> If any Per&s;on hath any other Notion, either thro' a long U&s;e of Words with Incon&s;i&s;tent Meanings, or thro' a neg|ligence of Thought; let Him but ask Him&s;elf, whether the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> be the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> or not: And, if it be, whether this Notion of it doth not ab&s;olutely exclude All other <HI>Legi&s;la|tors</HI> and <HI>Judges,</HI> in matters relating to Con&s;cience, or the favour of God; or, whether it can be <HI>His</HI> Kingdom, if any Mortal Men have &s;uch a Power of <HI>Legi&s;lation</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> in it. This <HI>En|quiry</HI> will bring Us back to the fir&s;t, which is the only True, Account of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> or
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in the mouth of a Chri|&s;tain: That it is the Number of Men, whether Small or Great, whether Di&s;per&s;ed or united, who truly and &s;incerely are Subjects to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> alone, as their <HI>Law-giver</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> in matters relating to the Favour of God, and their <HI>Eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The next principal point is, that, if the <HI>Church</HI> be the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and this <HI>King|dom be not of this World:</HI> this mu&s;t appear from the Nature and End of the <HI>Laws</HI> of Chri&s;t; and of tho&s;e Rewards and Puni&s;hments, which are the <HI>Sanctions</HI> of his <HI>Laws.</HI> Now his <HI>Laws</HI> are De|clarations, relating to the Favour of God in ano|ther State after this. They are Declarations of tho&s;e Conditions to be perform'd, in this World, on our part, without which God will not make us Happy in that to come. And they are almo&s;t All general Appeals to the <HI>Will</HI> of that God; to his <HI>Nature,</HI> known by the Common Rea&s;on of Man|kind; and to the imitation of that <HI>Nature,</HI> which mu&s;t be our <HI>Perfection.</HI> The <HI>Keeping his Com|mandments</HI> is declared the <HI>Way</HI> to Life; and
<PB N="18" REF="17">
the <HI>doing his Will,</HI> the Entrance into the <HI>King|dom of Heaven.</HI> The being <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is to this very End, that We may the better and more effectually perform the <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> The <HI>Laws</HI> of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> therefore, as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> left them, have nothing of <HI>this</HI> World in their view; no Tendency, either to the Exaltation of <HI>Some,</HI> in worldly pomp and dignity; or to their ab&s;o|lute Dominion, over the Faith and Religious conduct of <HI>Others</HI> of his Subjects; or to the ere|cting of any &s;ort of <HI>Temporal Kingdom,</HI> under the Covert and Name of a <HI>Spiritual</HI> one.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sanctions</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's Law</HI> are <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments.</HI> But of what &s;ort? Not the Re|wards of this World; not the Offices, or Glo|ries, of this State; not the pains of <HI>Pri&s;ons, Ba|ni&s;hments, Fines,</HI> or any le&s;&s;er and more <HI>Mode|rate Penalties</HI>; nay, not the much le&s;&s;er <HI>Nega|tive Di&s;couragements</HI> that belong to <HI>Humane So|ciety. He</HI> was far from thinking that <HI>The&s;e</HI> could be the In&s;truments of &s;uch a <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> as He thought acceptable to God. But, as the
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Great End of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> was to guide Men to Happine&s;s, after the &s;hort Images of it were over here below; &s;o, He took his <HI>Motives</HI> from that place, where His <HI>Kingdom</HI> fir&s;t began, and where it was at la&s;t to end; from tho&s;e <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> in a future State, which had no relation to this World: And, to &s;hew that his <HI>Kingdom was not of this World,</HI> all the <HI>San|ctions</HI> which He thought fit to give to <HI>His Laws,</HI> were <HI>not of this World</HI> at all.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> under&s;tood this &s;o well, that He gives an Account of His own Conduct, and that of Others in the &s;ame Station, in the&s;e words, <HI>Knowing the terrors of the Lord, we per|&s;wade men:</HI> whereas, in too many <HI>Chri&s;tian Coun|tries,</HI> &s;ince his days, if Some, who profe&s;s to &s;uc|ceed <HI>Him,</HI> were to give an Account of their own Conduct, it mu&s;t be in a quite contrary &s;train; <HI>Knowing the terrors of this World, and having them in our power, We do, not per&s;wade men, but force their outward Profe&s;&s;ion again&s;t their inward Per&s;wa&s;ion.</HI></P>

Now, wherever <HI>this</HI> is practis'd, whether in a great degree, or a &s;mall, in <HI>that</HI> place there is &s;o far a Change, from a <HI>Kingdom</HI> which is <HI>not of this world,</HI> to a <HI>Kingdom</HI> which <HI>is of this world.</HI> As &s;oon as ever you hear of any of the <HI>Engines</HI> of <HI>this world,</HI> whether of the greater, or the le&s;&s;er &s;ort, you mu&s;t imme|diately think that then, and &s;o far, the <HI>King|dom of this world</HI> takes place. For, if the ve|ry E&s;&s;ence of <HI>God's</HI> wor&s;hip be Spirit and Truth; If <HI>Religion</HI> be <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> un|der the <HI>Belief</HI> of a Supreme Governour and Judge; if True Real <HI>Faith</HI> cannot be the effect of <HI>Force</HI>; and, if there can be no <HI>Reward</HI> where there is no <HI>Willing Choice:</HI> then, in all, or any of the&s;e Ca&s;es, to apply Force or Flat|tery, Worldly plea&s;ure or pain; is to act contrary to the Intere&s;ts of True <HI>Religion,</HI> as it is plainly oppo&s;ite to the Maxims upon which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> founded his Kingdom; who cho&s;e the <HI>Motives</HI> which are <HI>not of this world,</HI> to &s;up|port a <HI>Kingdom</HI> which <HI>is not of this world.</HI> And indeed, it is too vi&s;ible to be hid, that
<PB N="21" REF="20">
wherever the <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> are changed, from future to pre&s;ent, from the World to come, to the World now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on; there, the <HI>Kingdom</HI> founded by our <HI>Sa|viour</HI> is, in the Nature of it, &s;o far changed, that it is become in &s;uch a degree, what He profe&s;&s;ed, <HI>His Kingdom was not:</HI> that is, <HI>of this world</HI>; of the &s;ame &s;ort, with other Common <HI>Earthly</HI> Kingdoms, in which the <HI>Rewards</HI> are, Worldly Honours, Po&s;ts, Of|fices, Pomp, Attendance, Dominion; and the Puni&s;hments are, Pri&s;ons, Fines, Bani&s;h|ments, Gallies and Racks; or &s;omething Le&s;s, of the &s;ame &s;ort.</P>
<P>If <HI>the&s;e</HI> can be the true &s;upports of a <HI>King|dom</HI> which is <HI>not of this World</HI>; then Sincerity, and Hypocri&s;y; Religion, and No Religion; Force, and Per&s;wa&s;ion; A Willing Choice, and a Terrified Heart; are become the &s;ame things: Truth and Fal&s;hood &s;tand in need of the &s;ame methods, to propagate and &s;upport them; and our <HI>Saviour</HI> him&s;elf was little acquainted with
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the <HI>Right</HI> way of increa&s;ing the Number of &s;uch <HI>Subjects,</HI> as He wi&s;hed for. If He had but at fir&s;t enlighten'd the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> as He did St. <HI>Paul</HI>; and employed the <HI>Sword</HI> which They bore, and the <HI>Favours</HI> They had in their hands, to bring <HI>Subjects</HI> into his <HI>King|dom</HI>; this had been an Expeditious and an ef|fectual way, according to the Conduct of &s;ome of his profe&s;&s;ed Followers, to have had a Glorious and Exten&s;ive <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>Church.</HI> But this was not his De&s;ign; unle&s;s it could be compa&s;|&s;ed in quite a different way.</P>
<P>And therefore, when You &s;ee <HI>Our Lord,</HI> in <HI>his</HI> methods, &s;o far removed from Tho&s;e of Many of his Di&s;ciples; when You read Nothing, in his Doctrine about his own <HI>Kingdom,</HI> of ta|king in the Concerns of this World, and mix|ing them with tho&s;e of Eternity; no Commands that the Frowns and Di&s;couragements of this pre&s;ent State &s;hould in any Ca&s;e attend upon Con&s;cience and Religion; No Rules again&s;t the Enquiry of All His Subjects into his <HI>Original</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<HI>Me&s;&s;age</HI> from Heaven; no Orders for the kind and charitable force of <HI>Penalties,</HI> or <HI>Capital Puni&s;hments,</HI> to make Men think and chu&s;e aright; no Calling upon the <HI>&s;ecular Arm,</HI> when|ever the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> &s;hould become <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> to inforce his Doctrines, or to back his <HI>Spiritual Authority</HI>; but, on the contrary, as plain a De|claration as a few Words can make, that <HI>His Kingdom is not of this World:</HI> I &s;ay, when You &s;ee this, from the whole Tenor of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;o va&s;tly oppo&s;ite to Many who take his Name into their Mouths, the Que&s;tion with you ought to be, Whether He did not know the Nature of his own <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>Church,</HI> better than Any &s;ince his Time? whether you can &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>He</HI> left any &s;uch matters to be decided again&s;t <HI>Him|&s;elf,</HI> and his own Expre&s;s profe&s;&s;ions; and, whe|ther if an <HI>Angel from Heaven</HI> &s;hould give you any Account of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> contrary to what He him&s;elf hath done, it can be of any Weight, or Authority, with Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I have now made &s;ome &s;uch ob&s;ervations,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
drawn from the <HI>Church</HI> being the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and not of any <HI>Men</HI> in that <HI>Kingdom</HI>; from the <HI>Nature</HI> of his <HI>Laws,</HI> and from tho&s;e <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> which are the San|ctions of tho&s;e Laws; as lead us naturally into the true <HI>Notion</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> or <HI>Kingdom,</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by excluding out of it every <HI>thing</HI> in|con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>His</HI> being <HI>King, Law-giver</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI>; as well as with the Nature of His <HI>Laws,</HI> and of His promi&s;es and Threatnings. I will on|ly make <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> Ob&s;ervations, grounded upon this: And &s;o conclude. And</P>
<P N="1">1. From what hath been &s;aid it is very plain, in general, that the Gro&s;&s;e&s;t Mi&s;takes in Judg|ment, about the Nature of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> s <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>Church,</HI> have ari&s;en from hence, that Men have argued from Other vi&s;ible <HI>Societies,</HI> and Other Vi&s;ible <HI>Kingdoms of this World,</HI> to what ought to be Vi&s;ible, and Sen&s;ible, in <HI>His Kingdom:</HI> Con&s;tantly leaving out of their <HI>Notion,</HI> the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential Part of it, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>King</HI> in his own <HI>Kingdom</HI>; forgetting this <HI>King</HI> him&s;elf, becau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="24">
He is not now &s;een by mortal Eyes; and Sub|&s;tituting <HI>Others</HI> in his Place, as <HI>Law-givers</HI> and <HI>Judges,</HI> in the &s;ame Points, in which <HI>He</HI> mu&s;t either <HI>Alone,</HI> or not at all, be <HI>Law-giver</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI>; not contented with &s;uch a <HI>Kingdom</HI> as He e&s;tabli&s;hed, and de&s;ires to reign in; but ur|ging and contending, that <HI>His Kingdom</HI> mu&s;t be like <HI>Other Kingdoms.</HI> Whereas He hath po&s;itive|ly warn'd them again&s;t any &s;uch Arguings, by a&s;&s;uring Them that this <HI>Kingdom</HI> is <HI>His Kingdom,</HI> and that it is <HI>not of this World</HI>; and therefore that No <HI>one</HI> of <HI>His Subjects</HI> is <HI>Law-giver</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> over <HI>Others</HI> of them, in matters relating to <HI>Salvation,</HI> but <HI>He</HI> alone; and that We mu&s;t not Frame our Ideas from the <HI>Kingdoms of this World,</HI> of what ought to be, in a vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible manner, in <HI>His Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. From what hath been &s;aid it appears that the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which is the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is the <HI>Number</HI> of Per&s;ons who are Sincere|ly, and Willingly, <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>Him,</HI> as <HI>Law-giver</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> in all matters truly relating to
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Con&s;cience, or Eternal Salvation. And the more clo&s;e and immediate this Regard to <HI>Him</HI> is, the more certainly and the more evidently true it is, that They are of his <HI>Kingdom.</HI> This may appear fully to their own Satisfaction, if They have recour&s;e to <HI>Him</HI> him&s;elf, in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>; if They think it a &s;ufficient Authority that He hath declared the <HI>Conditions</HI> of their <HI>Salvation,</HI> and that No Man upon Earth hath any Authority to declare any other, or to add one tittle to them; if They re&s;olve to perform what They &s;ee, He laith a &s;tre&s;s upon; and if They tru&s;t no mortal, with the ab&s;olute direction of their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> the pardon of their Sins, or the de|termining of their Intere&s;t in God's favour; but wait for their <HI>Judge,</HI> who alone can bring to light <HI>the hidden things of darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>If They feel them&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed and re&s;olved to receive the Words of <HI>Eternal Life</HI> from <HI>Him|&s;elf</HI>; to take their <HI>Faith</HI> from what He him&s;elf <HI>once delivered,</HI> who knew better than All the re&s;t of the World what He required of his own <HI>Subjects</HI>;
<PB N="27" REF="26">
to direct their <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> by his Rule, and their whole practice by the General Law which He laid down: If They feel them&s;elves in this di&s;po&s;ition, They may be very certain that They are truly his <HI>Subjects,</HI> and Members of his <HI>King|dom.</HI> Nor need They envy the Happine&s;s of <HI>Others,</HI> who may think it a much more evident Mark of their belonging to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that They have <HI>other</HI> Law-givers, and Judges, in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Religion,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; that They have recour&s;e not to <HI>his own</HI> Words, but the Words of <HI>Others</HI> who profe&s;s to interpret them; that They are ready to Submit to this <HI>In|terpretation,</HI> let it, be what it will, that They have &s;et up to Them&s;elves the <HI>Idol</HI> of an unin|telligible <HI>Authority,</HI> both in <HI>Belief,</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI>; in Words, <HI>under</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but in deed and in truth <HI>over</HI> Him; as it removes the minds of his <HI>Subjects</HI> from <HI>Him&s;elf,</HI> to Weak, and pa&s;&s;ionate Men; and as it claims the &s;ame Rule and Power in <HI>his Kingdom,</HI> which He him|&s;elf <HI>alone</HI> can have. But,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="28" REF="27">
3. This will be <HI>Another ob&s;ervation,</HI> that it evidently de&s;troys the <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as <HI>King,</HI> to &s;et up any Other <HI>Authority</HI> in <HI>His Kingdom,</HI> to which His Subjects are indi&s;pen&s;ably and ab&s;olutely obliged to Submit their Con&s;cien|ces, or their Conduct, in what is properly cal|led Religion. There are <HI>&s;ome</HI> Profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;ti|ans, who contend openly for &s;uch an <HI>Authority,</HI> as indi&s;pen&s;ably obliges All around Them to <HI>Unity</HI> of Profe&s;&s;ion; that is, to Profe&s;s even what They do not, what They cannot, believe to be true. This &s;ounds &s;o gro&s;sly, that <HI>Others,</HI> who think They act a glorious part in oppo&s;ing &s;uch an Enormity, are very willing, for their own &s;akes, to retain &s;uch an <HI>Authority</HI> as &s;hall oblige Men, whatever They them&s;elves think, though not to profe&s;s what They do not believe, yet, to forbear the <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>publication</HI> of what They do believe, let them believe it of never &s;o great Importance.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e <HI>Preten&s;ions</HI> are founded upon the mi&s;taken <HI>Notion</HI> of the <HI>Peace,</HI> as well as <HI>Authority</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> that is the <HI>Church,</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Which of them is the mo&s;t in&s;upporta|ble to an hone&s;t and a Chri&s;tian mind, I am not able to &s;ay: becau&s;e They both equally found the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> upon the ruines of Sincerity and Common Hone&s;ty; and mi&s;take <HI>Stupidity</HI> and <HI>Sleep,</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI>; becau&s;e They would both equally have prevented <HI>All Reformation</HI> where it hath been, and will for ever prevent it where it is not already; and, in a word, becau&s;e both equally deve&s;t <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> of his <HI>Empire</HI> in <HI>his own</HI> Kingdom; &s;et the obedience of his <HI>Subjects</HI> loo&s;e from <HI>Him|&s;elf</HI>; and teach them to pro&s;titute their <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> at the feet of <HI>Others,</HI> who have no right in &s;uch a manner to trample upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's Kingdom</HI> is a manly and Rea&s;onable <HI>Peace</HI>; built upon Charity, and Love, and mutual forbearance, and receiving one ano|ther, as God receives us. As for any other <HI>Peace</HI>; founded upon a Submi&s;&s;ion of our <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> as well as our <HI>Under&s;tandings</HI>; it is fal&s;ely &s;o
<PB N="30" REF="29">
called. It is not the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; but the <HI>Lethargy</HI> of it: and a <HI>Sleep unto Death,</HI> when his <HI>Subjects</HI> &s;hall throw off their relation to <HI>Him</HI>; fix their &s;ubjection to <HI>Others</HI>; and even in Ca&s;es, where They have a right to &s;ee, and where They think They &s;ee, his Will otherwi&s;e, &s;hall &s;hut their Eyes and go blind|fold at the Command of <HI>Others</HI>; becau&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Others</HI> are not pleas'd with their Enquiries into the Will of their great Lord and Judge.</P>
<P>To conclude, The <HI>Church of Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</HI> He is <HI>King</HI> in his own King|dom. He is Sole <HI>Law-giver</HI> to his Subjects, and Sole <HI>Judge,</HI> in matters relating to Salvation. His <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Sanctions</HI> are plainly fixed: and re|late to the Favour of God; and not at all to the Rewards, or Penalties, of <HI>this World.</HI> All his Subjects are <HI>equally</HI> his Subjects; and, as &s;uch, <HI>equally</HI> without Authority to alter, to add to, or to <HI>interpret,</HI> his <HI>Laws</HI> &s;o, as to claim the ab&s;o|lute Submi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Others</HI> to &s;uch <HI>Interpretation.</HI> And All are <HI>His Subjects,</HI> and in his Kingdom,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
who are ruled and governed by <HI>Him.</HI> Their <HI>Faith</HI> was <HI>once</HI> delivered by <HI>Him.</HI> The Condi|tions of their Happine&s;s were <HI>once</HI> laid down by <HI>Him.</HI> The Nature of <HI>God's Wor&s;hip</HI> was <HI>once</HI> de|clared by <HI>Him.</HI> And it is ea&s;y to judge, whe|ther of the Two is mo&s;t becoming a <HI>Subject</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> that is, a <HI>Member</HI> of his <HI>Church</HI>; to &s;eek all the&s;e particulars in tho&s;e plain and &s;hort Declarations of their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Law-giver</HI> him&s;elf: or to hunt after Them thro' the infinite contradictions, the numberle&s;s per|plexities, the endle&s;s di&s;putes, of <HI>Weak Men,</HI> in &s;everal Ages, till the Enquirer him&s;elf is lo&s;t in the Labyrinth, and perhaps &s;its down in De|&s;pair, or Infidelity. If <HI>Christ</HI> be our <HI>King</HI>; let us &s;hew our &s;elves <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> alone, in the great affair of Con&s;cience and Eternal Salvation: and, without fear of Man's judgment, live and act as becomes Tho&s;e who wait for the appear|ance of an All-knowing and Impartial Judge; even <HI>that King,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Kingdom is not of this World.</HI></P>
