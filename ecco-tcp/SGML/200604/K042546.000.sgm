<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Doctrines which the <HI>Clergy</HI> preach to the Peo|ple, and the Examples they give them, have an extraordinary Influ|ence upon their Thoughts and Actions, is evident from Experience, and from the very Rea&s;on of the In&s;titution of the Order. That the Examples which too many of the Clergy have lately given them, and the Doctrines which they have preach'd to them, have been nei|ther Chri&s;tian nor Moral, is too evi|dent from the di&s;mal Con&s;equences of them; from the Divi&s;ions which they have caus'd in their Hearers; from their groundle&s;s Fears and Jealou&s;ies; from their Malice and their implaca|ble Fury; from their Hatred and their Enmity, not only to each other, but to their Native Country, to their very Rights and Liberties; from the unfor|tunate
<PB REF="3">
Event of the late War, in &s;pight of Succe&s;s, and an unparallell'd Series of Victories; from a Peace more calamitous than the mo&s;t fatal War, and more de&s;tructive of Commerce; from the dreadful and horrible Dangers which we have &s;o narrowly e&s;caped by the immediate Hand of God, without any Thanks to our own Prudence and Ver|tue; and la&s;tly, from the Dangers and the Calamities which &s;till threaten us, and &s;till hang over us, and over all the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>To remove the Cau&s;es of all the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs, that the Effects may cea&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay down a plain and certain Rule, by which the very mean|e&s;t of the People may be able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h a <HI>Zealot</HI> from an <HI>Incendiary,</HI> a Prie&s;t of <HI>God</HI> from a Prie&s;t of <HI>Baal,</HI> and the Precepts of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> from <HI>Human Traditions</HI> and the Doctrines of <HI>Devils.</HI></P>
<P>That I have di&s;cover'd and reprov'd the Vices of &s;ome of the Clergy by the
<PB REF="4">
very &s;ame Method by which They have caus'd our Mi&s;eries; that I have done this by a Sermon, by a cho&s;en Text, and by &s;evere, but too ju&s;t Re|proaches, is, I hope, excu&s;able in me, or They are altogether inexcu&s;able: For whereas They have made u&s;e of Calumny and Defamation; I have kept &s;trictly within the Bounds of a mode&s;t Satyre, which &s;pares the Per&s;ons and attacks the Vices, and never cen&s;ures the De&s;erving, nor condemns the Inno|cent; and whereas They have had re|cour&s;e to Calumny and ungenerous Slan|ders, only in order to cau&s;e Divi&s;ions, and to inflame Animo&s;ities, I have en|deavour'd by ju&s;t Reproaches to revive and re&s;tore Charity.</P>
<P>The Author of the following Di&s;|cour&s;e was born and bred in the Com|munion of the <HI>Church of England</HI>; and nothing in the following Sheets is in the lea&s;t de&s;ign'd by him to reflect on that Pious, Learned, and Numerous Body, who are truly <HI>Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts</HI>
<PB REF="5">
of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> But then he declares, that he cannot apprehend how any one can be a truly Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t, who makes it the entire Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of his Life to root Charity out from the Souls of Men, and by that Means to drive from the Face of the Earth the very Life and Soul of Chri&s;tianity. And as he cannot conceive that any thing can be a Part or a Member of a Body, which has not a Communication with, and a Subordination to, the Head of that Body; as he cannot conceive that any one can be a Prie&s;t of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> who di&s;owns the <HI>Papal</HI> Supremacy, &s;o he cannot believe that any one can be truly a Prie&s;t of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> but he, who be|ing united to the Faithful and Obedient Part of the Clergy, does with them ac|knowledge King <HI>GEORGE</HI> alone, for his Rightful Head, and his Su|pream Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Governour.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE UPON THE Fir&s;t EPISTLE General OF St. <HI>JOHN, Chap.</HI> 2. and part of the 18th <HI>Ver&s;e. Even now there are many Antichri&s;ts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THERE have been &s;everal wild and extravagant Ex|plications, or rather Appli|cations of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> by tho&s;e who have had a mind to fix it upon &s;ome parti|cular Per&s;on, as upon the <HI>Pope,</HI> or <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;piritual or &s;ecular Tyrants, according as they who apply'd it were corrupted or mi&s;guided by Intere&s;t, or Malice, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Fanatick Enthu&s;i|a&s;m; but by Antichri&s;t, in the genuine

Signification of the Word, may be meant every one who is thoroughly and entirely oppo&s;ed to the Lord's Anointed, <HI>i. e.</HI> to Chri&s;t: But becau&s;e there are no Creatures &s;o oppos'd, and &s;o contrary to him, as the Devil and his Angels, they are mo&s;t pro|perly the Antichri&s;ts of whom the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, who appear in &s;undry Shapes upon this Earthly Globe, and make u&s;e of hu|mane In&s;truments and humane Organs to accompli&s;h their infernal De&s;igns. And as we may find, by the Words of our Text, that many of them appeared in the World, even in the mo&s;t pure and primitive Times, who is &s;o ea&s;y as to believe that they are not more numerous in our Days? In order then to the de&s;cribing and di&s;tingui&s;hing them, &s;o that they may be clearly known and di&s;cover'd, we intend in the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e to handle the&s;e three Points.</P>

for you (Brethren) to make the Applica|tion your &s;elves, and to point out the&s;e to one another; of whom it may be &s;aid, in the Words of the Text, <HI>viz. Even now there are many Antichri&s;ts.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, As our Saviour was a Prie&s;t, and the be&s;t and holie&s;t of Prie&s;ts; Anti|chri&s;t mu&s;t be likewi&s;e a Prie&s;t, acting by the Sugge&s;tion of the Devil; for no one can be thoroughly and entirely oppo&s;ed to the be&s;t and the holie&s;t, but the mo&s;t pro|fligate and the vile&s;t of Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As Chri&s;t is a King who is perfectly good and gracious; Antichri&s;t mu&s;t be the wor&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;upportable of Tyrants.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As our Saviour was a Prophet, and an infallible Prophet, becau&s;e he could not but foretel the Events which he him|&s;elf had decreed; Antichri&s;t, in Oppo&s;ition to him, mu&s;t be a Prophet, and for this rea&s;on a fal&s;e and deluding Prophet, be|cau&s;e he has neither him&s;elf any Power over the Future, nor is influenc'd and en|lighten'd by him who has. But now we come,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To con&s;ider the De&s;igns, the Doctrines, the Examples, and the Influen|ces of Chri&s;t and Antichri&s;t in their Prie&s;t|hood, their Prophecies, and their Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We &s;hall begin with their Empire, becau&s;e Chri&s;t was a Prophet, and a Prie&s;t, only to advance his Kingdom; and Anti|chri&s;t too is a Prophet, and a Prie&s;t, only to promote his Tyranny. Let us now &s;ee what &s;ort of Kingdom the one, and what &s;ort of Tyranny the other, came into the World to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>Since then the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, or of the Me&s;&s;iah, is a Spiritual Kingdom, or the Kingdom of Heaven, the Tyranny of An|tichri&s;t mu&s;t be a Spiritual Tyranny, or the Tyranny of the Prince of Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us now enquire what this Kingdom of Heaven is, and in what it con&s;i&s;ts; how it began and flouri&s;h'd; how it came to be impair'd, and how far our Saviour came to re&s;tore it; and we &s;hall &s;ee, by making this Enquiry, what &s;ort of Tyranny the Tyranny of the Devil is; how it began, how it increa&s;ed, how it came to be im|pair'd; and how far Antichri&s;t has a de&s;ign to re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of Heaven then, is a Kingdom who&s;e King propo&s;es the Hap|pine&s;s of his Subjects, as the ultimate End of his Reigning over them; for God is perfectly happy in him&s;elf, and wants not our Obedience, nor our Service. A King|dom who&s;e King propo&s;es to make his Sub|jects ea&s;y and happy here, to prepare them
<PB N="5" REF="14">
for eternal Happine&s;s hereafter. <HI>Matt.</HI> 11. 28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> His Empire then mu&s;t be an Empire of Rea|&s;on and Law, and, by Con&s;equence, an Empire of Liberty. St. <HI>James</HI> 1. 5. <HI>But who&s;o looketh into the perfect law of liberty, that man &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his deed.</HI> 'Tis this Law of Liberty which e&s;tabli&s;hes the Rule of Rea&s;on, to re&s;tore the Kingdom of God, his Empire over the Soul and Con&s;cience, and frees Man from the Slavery into which he was brought by his Pa&s;&s;ions, which is the Empire and Tyranny of the Devil, and of Antichri&s;t his Son.</P>
<P>For this Tyranny of Antichri&s;t, being in every thing oppo&s;ite to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t de&s;ign both the Temporal and Eternal Mi&s;ery of his Subjects; mu&s;t de&s;ign to make them unhappy here, in order to the making them eternally mi&s;e|rable hereafter, and mu&s;t not be a Rule of Rea&s;on and Law, but an Empire of Pa&s;&s;ion and Will; and mu&s;t tend in every thing to &s;ubvert the Empire which Chri&s;t hath e&s;tabli&s;hed upon Earth, and to re&s;tore the Tyranny of the Devil, who&s;e Kingdom, as it began at fir&s;t, &s;o it hath ever &s;ince conti|nued, in Oppo&s;ition to, the Kingdom of Heaven. And as our Saviour teaches his Di&s;ciples to renounce the World, the Fle&s;h,
<PB N="6" REF="15">
and the Devil, in order to advance his Kingdom upon Earth, Antichri&s;t obliges his to make u&s;e of all three, to promote his &s;piritual Tyranny.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of Heaven began with the Creation of Angels. God reign'd over tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, who are entirely hap|py in their Obedience; and their great and comprehen&s;ible Law was Love, the Love of God and their Fellow Creatures. They loved God, becau&s;e they &s;aw him as he is, all Beauty and all Attraction; and they lo|ved their Fellow Creatures, becau&s;e they &s;aw them the Objects of their Creator's Love. Go&s;p. of St. <HI>John,</HI> Ch. 15. Ver. 12. <HI>This is my commandment, That ye love one a|nother, as I have loved you.</HI> 1 Epi&s;t. of St. <HI>John,</HI> Ch. 4. Ver. 11. <HI>If God &s;o loved us, we ought al&s;o to love one another.</HI> And this Love was at once their Duty and their Happi|ne&s;s; a Love attended with perfect Plea|&s;ure, and with Joy un&s;peakable</P>
<P>But when afterwards the impious A&s;pi|rer, <HI>Lucifer,</HI> drew off his Love from his Creator and his Fellow Creatures, and placed it upon him&s;elf, that Self-love was immediately attended with Pride, and Rage, and Envy, and Hatred, and Malice; Pa&s;&s;ions till then unknown in Heaven, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with perfect Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">
Thus fell <HI>Lucifer</HI>; but alone he fell not; Millions of immortal Spirits he drew after him into Perdition. By his Lies he &s;edu|ced their Souls, defaced in their Minds the Love of their Creator, and of their Fellow Creatures for their Creator's &s;ake, and planted the Love of them&s;elves there. With Divine Love away went all their Happine&s;s. Self-love was immediately fol|lowed in them, as in their Seducer before, by Pride, and Rage, and Envy, and Ha|tred and Malice; and they who while they were united to God by Love, were Angels, divided from him by Pride and Hate, became immediately Devils; and from the mo&s;t glorious, mo&s;t happy, mo&s;t beautiful part of the Creation, became all on a &s;udden the mo&s;t execrable and the mo&s;t horrible: And as before they fell, that Divine Love by which they were united to God, was at one and the &s;ame time their &s;overeign Law, and their &s;upreme Felicity; &s;o when by Pride and Hatred, and the re&s;t of their Diabolical Pa&s;&s;ions, they broke that Divine Union, their Pride, their Hatred, and the re&s;t of their tormenting Pa&s;&s;ions, became at once their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and their Hell.</P>
<P>'Twas after this that God created Man, to &s;upply the Room of the fallen Angels, and to plant the &s;ame Kingdom upon Earth which remained among the ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="8" REF="17">
Spirits in Heaven. He created them little lower than the Angels; enlightned, inno|cent, happy, immortal. The Empire of his Maker was the &s;ame in him, that it was in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, an Empire of Rea&s;on and Law; and the &s;ame Law was given to him which made the Angels hap|py. That great and comprehen&s;ive Law was Love; the Love of his Maker and of his Fellow Creatures, for his Creator's &s;ake; <HI>which</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles tells us) <HI>is the fulfilling of all Law</HI>; and which our Saviour had told us before, Go&s;p. of St. <HI>John,</HI> Chap 14. Ver. 23. <HI>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</HI> And as long as this charming Law remained in the Heart of Man inviolated, it was always attended with Peace, and Joy, and inexpre&s;&s;ible Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But Satan, who in every thing by Di|vine Permi&s;&s;ion oppo&s;es the De&s;igns of God, attempted to de&s;troy that Kingdom upon Earth, which he had before impair'd in Heaven. And what Wonder if the Sedu|cer of Angels &s;ucceeded in his Attempts upon Man; if he extingui&s;h'd Divine Love in his Heart, and inflam'd it with Self|love; if he di&s;&s;olved that Union which Man had with God, and overturn'd his
<PB N="9" REF="18">
Dependance on him; de&s;troy'd the Em|pire which Heaven had &s;et up in his Soul, which was an Empire of Rea&s;on and Law, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd his own Tyranny there; an Empire of Will and Pa&s;&s;ion, of Pride, and Rage, and Hatred, and Malice, and all tho&s;e accur&s;ed and damnable Pa&s;&s;ions, by which the Tormentor is him&s;elf tormen|ted, to which the Tyrant is him&s;elf a Slave?</P>
<P>Thus Satan brought Sin, and Mi&s;ery, and Death upon Mankind; who was cre|ated innocent, happy, immortal: And the Kingdom which he e&s;tabli&s;hed here upon Earth, in oppo&s;ition to the Kingdom of Heaven, encreas'd &s;o fa&s;t, and extended &s;o wide, that Charity, which is the Love of God and our Neighbour, was almo&s;t ex|tingui&s;h'd upon Earth; that Men were mi&s;erably divided from God, and from one another; and that all Mankind, to the re&s;erve of a &s;mall Remnant, were become abandoned Slaves to the Devil, and to De|villi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to re&s;tore the Kingdom of his Father, and to de&s;troy the Tyranny of the Devil.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;ted, <HI>That he might de&s;troy the works of the Devil,</HI> 1 Epi&s;t. of St. <HI>John,</HI> Chap. 3. Ver. 8.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19">
When the Son of God came into the World to de&s;troy the Tyranny of the De|vil; and to re&s;tore his own and his Father's Kingdom; that Kingdom of Love, and Peace, and Joy, which was by the Divine Permi&s;&s;ion impair'd upon Earth by the Devil, at the Fall of Man, and under which the ble&s;&s;ed Spirits are for ever happy in Heaven; in order to re&s;tore that King|dom, he a&s;&s;umed the Prie&s;thood. Not only becau&s;e there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for a Prie&s;t, who could make a propitiatory and &s;ati&s;|factory Sacrifice for the Sins of the World; but becau&s;e al&s;o there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for a Doctrine, which might incline and recti|fie the Wills of Men, by enlight'ning and convincing their Under&s;tandings; that as Man fell from Perfection freely and of his own choice, he might likewi&s;e be re&s;tor'd freely and of his own choice; &s;ince if the Change in him &s;hould be wrought wholly by Grace, his Conver&s;ion would proceed from a Force as it were upon his Mind, and would not be the Action of a free Agent.</P>
<P>The Kingdom then that our Saviour came to re&s;tore, was the Empire of Cha|rity, the Love of God, and of our Neigh|bour for the &s;ake of God. For where-ever that Divine Love reigns, there is the King|dom of Heaven; and where-ever that Love
<PB N="11" REF="20">
is wanting, is Hell and outer Darkne&s;s&punc; <HI>Beloved,</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>John</HI>) <HI>Let us love one ano+ther. Every one that loveth is born of God' and knoweth God. He that loveth not, know|eth not God: for God is love,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s fir&s;t Epi&s;t. Chap. 4. Ver. 7, 8. But here, by the way, we are to take notice, that this Love of our Neighbour is to be extended to all Mankind, even to our mo&s;t cruel Enemies: But it ought to be more inten&s;e or remi&s;s, according to the different Re|lations in which Men &s;tand to each other. We ought to love Chri&s;tians more than Infidels; our Parents and Kindred more than our Acquaintance; our Acquaintance more than Strangers, and our Country Men more than Foreigners.</P>
<P>As the Law of Divine Love, in the Ob&s;ervation of which lay the Happine&s;s of the fir&s;t Man, and the Perfection of his Nature, was &s;ubverted by Self-love, upon the Sugge&s;tion of the Devil; our Saviour, that he might re-e&s;tabli&s;h that Divine Love, endeavour'd to root out the Love of one's Self, by a Doctrine that was be&s;t adapted to the rea&s;onable Nature of corrupted Man. He attack'd it therefore in all the &s;everal Branches of it, Pride, Avarice and Luxury; or in the Words of St. <HI>John, The la&s;t of the fle&s;h, the la&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life:</HI> to which he oppo&s;ed a pro|found
<PB N="12" REF="21">
Humility, a rigid Mortification, and a &s;incere Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. Not that fanta|&s;tick Scorn of the World, which proceeds from a Stoical Pride; but that which is foun|ded upon the mo&s;t &s;olid Foundation, the Intere&s;t that one has in God: For he to him&s;elf being &s;elf-&s;ufficient, he who has him, has all Things.</P>
<P>But as Pride is the mo&s;t dangerous of the three foremention'd Sins, (for that is the continual Feaver of the Mind; whereas the other attack it but by irregular Ac|ce&s;&s;es, Pride in&s;olently intruding at the very Altar, where the others never dare to approach,) there is no Vertue that our Saviour recommends more throughout the whole Go&s;pel, than Humility: nay, almo&s;t every Vertue which he recommends to his Di&s;ciples, appears to be founded on that; as Poorne&s;s of Spirit, Meekne&s;s, Gentlene&s;s, Patience, Forbearance, Peace-making, Long|&s;uffering, Mercy, Forgivene&s;s: for nothing is more u&s;ual than for the Proud to be &s;woln and drunk with Vanity; to be pro|voking, di&s;dainful, in&s;olent, fiery, impa|tient, intractable, cruel, revengeful, im|placable. That Sorrow and Remor&s;e which is nece&s;&s;ary to Repentance, implies a &s;evere Mortification, upon a View of the Turpitude of Sin, and the Vilene&s;s of our own Natures. Even the three Cardinal
<PB N="13" REF="22">
Vertues of the Chri&s;tian Religion are founded upon Humility. Not only Cha|rity, to which the other two are &s;ubor|dinate; for as Pride is the Effect of Self|love, Self-love is augmented by Pride: but Faith, which is an A&s;&s;ent to Truths above our Under&s;tanding, becau&s;e they are re|vealed by God to us, is an owning of the Weakne&s;s and Blindne&s;s of our Rea&s;on, as the Hope of Salvation by the Merits of Chri&s;t is a manife&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion of the De|pravity, and Corruption, and Impotence of our Wills.</P>
<P>As true Humility is the &s;olid Founda|tion of every Chri&s;tian Vertue; a Founda|tion which extending as low as Hell, is the Ba&s;is of a Fabrick which reaches to the very Heaven of Heavens; our Saviour's Doctrine attack'd Pride in all its numerous Offsprings, Anger, Envy, Hatred, Malice, and in all their unrighteous Effects, <HI>viz.</HI> bitter and barbarous Invectives, pre&s;um|ptuous and damnable Judgments, Debate, Contention, Strife, Revenge, and Murder; and oppo&s;ed to them the contrary Vertues, Gentlene&s;s, Meekne&s;s, Patience, Forbear|ance, Peace-making, Mercy, Long&s;uffering, and Forgivene&s;s; nay more, real and un|feigned Love to our mo&s;t cruel Enemies. Tho&s;e who had the foremention'd Graces, our Saviour pronounced Ble&s;&s;ed, and left
<PB N="14" REF="23">
it to be demon&s;trated by Experience, how much accur&s;ed they were, who were tor|mented by the Pa&s;&s;ions and the Sins.</P>
<P>Thus our Saviour taught the Will of his Father, which de&s;cended from Heaven to Earth with him; and being for ever an High Prie&s;t after the Order of <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> the Prince of Peace, an Order which is in|finitely &s;uperiour to the <HI>Aaronical</HI> Order, infu&s;ed into the Hearts of his Di&s;ciples, not a windy, contentious Zeal, for the Ob&s;er|vation of Forms and Ceremonies, and the Political Government of an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church; but Vertues and Graces which no Philo&s;ophy, and no Religion had ever taught before; to wit, a profound Humi|lity, and a Love Divine.</P>
<P>But tho' this Doctrine was never &s;o conformable to the rea&s;onable Nature of corrupted Man, and tho' it was confirm'd by Signs and Wonders, that manife&s;ted a Power which commanded Nature, and which made the very Devils obey; it would never have prevailed over the Minds of Men, which are influenc'd &s;o forcibly and con&s;tantly by their Sen&s;es, if it had not been enforced by the Example of him who taught it. His Life and his Doctrine were all of a Piece: And as the De&s;ign of his coming down from Heaven was, by the means of Humility, to re&s;tore Charity,
<PB N="15" REF="24">
to re-unite Mankind to God, and to one a|nother; his Life and his Death, his In|carnation, his Birth, his Bapti&s;m, his Choice of the mo&s;t abject of Men for his Di&s;ciples, and his Submi&s;&s;ion to the Death of the Cro&s;s, were each of them &s;o many eternal Le&s;&s;ons of Humility, are all of them &s;o many amazing Miracles of unparallell'd Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and of Love Divine.</P>
<P>His very Miracles were of a Piece with the re&s;t of his Life, and were &s;o many Ex|amples to that Doctrine of Charity which they confirm'd by their Power; as different in this from tho&s;e which were wrought by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as their De&s;igns were different. For as the De&s;ign of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was to &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;h one Nation from another, and to e&s;tabli&s;h one by the Extirpation of many; the Wonders which he wrought were an&s;werable to that De&s;ign, attended by Terrour, and followed by De&s;truction, wrought in favour of a few, comparative|ly &s;peaking, to the Plague, and Mi&s;ery, and De&s;truction of many.</P>
<P>But as the De&s;ign of our Saviour's de|&s;cending from Heaven was to remove all Separation, and all Di&s;tinction, and to heal all Divi&s;ions among&s;t Men; as his Doctrine was adapted to all Nations, and to all Men, contrary in that to the Rites and Cere|monies of the Judaick Law; as it was
<PB N="16" REF="25">
framed to comprehend all, to unite all, and to make all its Followers ea&s;ie here, and eternally happy hereafter: So like|wi&s;e his Miracles, without Partiality and without Di&s;tinction, brought Help and Comfort to all. The <HI>Roman</HI> and the <HI>Sama|ritan,</HI> as well as the <HI>Jew,</HI> had nothing of Terrour, had nothing of De&s;truction in them; but were peaceful and gentle all of them, as the Dove that de&s;cended from Heaven upon him who wrought them.</P>
<P>If Men were hungry in de&s;art Places, he was at the Expence of a New Creation to feed them; if they were langui&s;hing under Di&s;ea&s;es, by a &s;upernatural Power he healed them: he healed them by that gentle and peaceful Power which calm'd the Winds and Seas that were about to de&s;troy them; that Power that controul'd and rebuk'd the Devils that were bu&s;ied in tormenting them.</P>
<P>As our Saviour's Miracles were all of a Piece with his Doctrine, his Delivery of that Doctrine was worthy of them both. It was with Power that penetrated to the inmo&s;t Souls, and a&s;toni&s;h'd and confound|ed his mo&s;t obdurate Hearers. St. <HI>Luke</HI> Chap. 4. Ver. 32. <HI>And they were a&s;toni&s;hed at his doctrine; for his word was with power.</HI> And St. <HI>Matth.</HI> Chap. 7. Ver. 29. <HI>For he taught them as one having authority, and not</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="26">
<HI>as the Scribes.</HI> His Delivery of his divine Doctrine, was not like that of the cold, unconcern'd and flegmatick Teachers of the Law: No, there was no le&s;s than God in his Voice, in his Mien, and in his eve|ry Action.</P>
<P>As Religion &s;o far re&s;embles Civil Go|vernment, that it mu&s;t be carried on by the &s;ame Methods by which it fir&s;t began; the Apo&s;tles, after our Saviour's A&s;cen&s;ion, con|tinued to preach the very &s;ame Doctrine that he had taught before, confirm'd it by Miracles of the &s;ame Kind, enforc'd it by an Imitation of their Ma&s;ter's Life, and by their own wonderful Delivery of it. When the Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> preached to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> his manner of &s;peaking appear'd as new to them as the Doctrine he taught: And as he &s;poke of Things to them, which neither Eye had &s;een, nor Ear had heard, nor had it entred into their Hearts to con|ceive; &s;o he &s;poke to them in &s;uch a man|ner, as never Man had &s;poke to them. And there was &s;omething in his Delivery, as far above the Thunder of their <HI>Pericles</HI> and their <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> as the Things which he had &s;aid to them, were of infinitely more Importance, and more Concern to his Hearers. And he, who when he &s;poke of the Things of this World, was &s;o very cold, and &s;o unconcerned, that his Bodily
<PB N="18" REF="27">
Pre&s;ence was weak, and his Speech con|temptible; even this cold and unconcern'd Apo&s;tle, when he di&s;cours'd of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, of Temperance, and of Judgment to come, was &s;o &s;trangely animated, &s;o won|derfully penetrated with the Heavenly Truths which he utter'd, that the very Tyrant who came to Judge him and to Condemn him, trembled at what his Pri|&s;oner &s;poke. <HI>Acts</HI> 24. 25.</P>
<P>Which naturally brings me to the Effect and Influence, which &s;o Divine a Doctrine, thus enforced, and thus delivered, had up|on the Minds of its Hearers. Which is as much greater than the Impre&s;&s;ions which the Di&s;cour&s;es of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Orators had upon their A&s;&s;emblies, as Heaven is great|er and higher than Earth. And whereas tho&s;e Orators thought they effected a migh|ty matter, if they changed the Opinions of their A&s;&s;emblies, in relation to their own, their Friends, or their Countries Reputa|tion and Intere&s;ts; our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles prevailed upon tho&s;e who heard them, to contemn all earthly Reputation and Intere&s;ts; to de&s;pi&s;e Riches, and Pow|er, and Glory, and even Life it &s;elf. And the working this Change in the Heart of corrupted Man, was a greater Miracle, than the changing the Elements, the heal|ing Di&s;ea&s;es, or the driving out Devils.
<PB N="19" REF="28">
Behold Thou&s;ands of Souls flaming with Charity, and loving their Creator with all their Might, and their Neighbours as them|&s;elves. Behold them parting with all they have, and willing and contented to &s;uffer Want, to relieve the Nece&s;&s;ities of others. <HI>Acts,</HI> Chap. 4. Ver. 31. to the end. Be|hold Thou&s;ands of Souls gladly choo&s;ing, and joyfully embracing Poverty, and Infa|my, and Sorrow, and Pain, and Death, to render them&s;elves acceptable to him whom they love. So much was the Kingdom of God re&s;tored, and the Tyranny of the Devil impaired, in the Hearts of Men.</P>
<P>Such were the Effects of our Saviour's Doctrine, &s;uch was the Influence which it had on the Minds of Men; at which Sa|tan, alarm'd, contriv'd by a Ma&s;ter-piece of infernal Malice, to make this very Re|ligion, by which Chri&s;t de&s;ign'd to unite Men to God and to one another, the Occa|&s;ion of introducing a more dangerous and de&s;perate Divi&s;ion between them, than e|ver had appear'd upon any worldly Ac|count; of making Self-love to take a deep|er Root, and &s;pread with more luxuriant Branches; of kindling in Mens Hearts a &s;piritual Pride, more fierce and more fiery than had ever appear'd before; a Pride attended with a more implacable Anger, a more inveterate Malice, and a more ir|reconcilable

Hatred. And in order to &s;uc|ceed in this Devili&s;h De&s;ign, he who knows by him&s;elf, who ruines Man by &s;oothing and by plea&s;ing him, that there is no Ene|my like the Traytor-Friend, and that &s;o Divine a Doctrine could not be re&s;i&s;ted effectually, if it were oppo&s;ed openly; at|tempts to de&s;troy it, by a Pretence to pro|pagate it; delegates his &s;piritual Tyranny to &s;ome Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts, and prevails up|on them, in order to extend it and e&s;tabli&s;h it, to divide, and weaken, and ruine the Church, by a pretended, impudent, ob&s;tre|perous Zeal for its Unity; to teach his Will for the Will of the Mo&s;t High, and by a Height of Wickedne&s;s, which would be incredible if we had not &s;o often &s;een it, to prove the Doctrine of the Devil by the Word of God, mi&s;erably wre&s;ted to the Perdition of the perfidious Teachers, and the credulous Hearers. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 1. <HI>Now the Spirit &s;peaketh expre&s;ly, That in the latter times &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith, giving heed to &s;educing Spirits, and to doctrines of Devils.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Antichri&s;ts mention'd in the Text; who to promote their own and the Devil's &s;piritual Tyranny, preach not the Doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but the De|vil's and their own. 'Tis not their Bu&s;ine&s;s to preach up Charity, or to teach Humili|ty,
<PB N="21" REF="30">
or any of the Vertues that produce or maintain Charity, as Gentlene&s;s, Meekne&s;s, Patience, Forbearance, Peace making, Mer|cy, Long &s;uffering, and Forgivene&s;s. If at any time they take Notice of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, in order to mingle it with their own, and make the latter pa&s;s un&s;u&s;pected, they do it after &s;uch a manner, as &s;hews very plainly, that it is not that they e|&s;pou&s;e; as &s;hall be further ob&s;erved in its proper Place. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to preach Divi&s;ion and Di&s;&s;ention, a Spirit of Party and of Faction, and to incite and inflame tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions that create or nouri&s;h Divi|&s;ion; as Anger, Envy, Hatred, Malice, evil Speaking, evil Surmizings, impudent and opprobrious Invectives, pre&s;umptuous and damnable Judgments, pretended Di|&s;tru&s;ts and ungrounded Jealou&s;ies, audaci|ous and provoking Threatnings, Debate, Contention, Strife, Revenge, Confu&s;ion, Riot, Murder. 'Tis their Bu&s;ine&s;s to in|cen&s;e and exa&s;perate their Di&s;ciples again&s;t all who contradict their Opinions; not what they pretend to believe as to the <HI>Cre|denda</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, but the Faith they profe&s;s as to their own Traditions, and the Doctrines of Devils. And therefore 'tis their Bu&s;ine&s;s to inflame their Di&s;ciples, not again&s;t Infidels (whether Jews or Turks,) or again&s;t Pagans, but again&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="31">
tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Faith; nor again&s;t tho&s;e, who while they have only the Name of Chri&s;tians, are either Dei&s;ts or down|right Athei&s;ts by an open avowed Profe&s;|&s;ion, or are thought to be &s;uch at lea&s;t in their Hearts, by the horrible Sins in which they live impenitent; but again&s;t true and &s;incere Believers; again&s;t tho&s;e who are under the Fear of God, and the &s;acred Power of Con&s;cience. The&s;e they account their mortal Enemies, again&s;t whom they exa&s;perate and inflame their Di&s;ciples, ex|horting them both by Voice and Example, &s;ometimes to laugh, &s;ometimes to rail with unmanner'd frontle&s;s Invectives, at all the mo&s;t venerable Chri&s;tian Vertues which &s;hine &s;o bright in the others, as Humility, Meekne&s;s, Moderation, Union, Charity; to hate them with an irreconcilable Ha|tred, to keep no Faith with them, to hold no Tru&s;t inviolable, to be bound by nei|ther Vows nor Oaths, but as often as they find Opportunity, to pur&s;ue them to the De&s;truction of their Reputation, Liberty, Goods, and Life it &s;elf; and to break thro' all Bonds, both Divine and Humane, to oppre&s;s them and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>And as the Power of this World is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upporting their &s;piritual Tyranny, they never fail to in&s;inuate into their Di&s;ciples, that 'tis their Duty to throw
<PB N="23" REF="32">
as much of into their Hands, as they are able to gra&s;p; to per&s;uade them, that they are bound to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e temporal Tyrants, with whom They their Pa&s;tors have made an implicit Contract for the mutual en&s;laving of Mankind. And the more the&s;e temporal Tyrants are the Devil's Vicegerents, the more they tram|ple upon Law, and Rea&s;on, and Equity, which are Bonds of Peace and Union to Mankind; that 'tis &s;till more their Duty to extol them, to obey them, to &s;erve them, and to adore them. And if the&s;e Tyrants are the Rulers of the native Countries of the&s;e Antichri&s;ts and their Di&s;ciples, the&s;e Teachers indu&s;triou&s;ly inform their Hear|ers, that they are ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen|&s;ably bound to obey them, whatever exor|bitant Things they enjoin, or to &s;uffer whatever they are graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to in|flict; and this, contrary to Nature's origi|nal Law, (the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Precept of which is Self-pre&s;ervation, and in order to it Self-defence,) that Law which our Saviour came to re&s;tore and to fulfil, and which none but the Devil and his Di&s;ci|ples can ever come to de&s;troy. And to induce them to this blind and impious O|bedience, they endeavour to prove, that the&s;e Tyrants are their Lords by Virtue of Fatherhood, and their Sovereign by Right
<PB N="24" REF="33">
Divine; tho' as good, as wi&s;e, and as for|cible Arguments may be brought to prove, that the Devil is a Lord by Virtue of Fa|therhood, and a Monarch by Right Di|vine, and con&s;equently, that he ought al|ways to be obeyed, and never to be re|&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e Antichri&s;ts teach their Di|&s;ciples to hate and per&s;ecute tho&s;e Chri&s;ti|ans mo&s;t, who are under the Fear of God, and the Power of Con&s;cience; of all their Country Men and Fellow Subjects, they in&s;truct them to hate and malign them mo&s;t, who are the mo&s;t Zealous for the Maintenance of their native Rights, and the Validity and Power of Law.</P>
<P>But if the foremention'd &s;ecular Tyrants are the Rulers of foreign Nations, and are mortal Enemies to the native Countries of the&s;e Antichri&s;tian Teachers, and of their Di&s;ciples; they are &s;o far from being di&s;|couraged by this, that they are animated and encouraged the more to prevail upon their Hearers to e&s;pou&s;e them and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, to rejoice at their Succe&s;&s;es, and to mourn at their Calamities, and to declare them&s;elves Enemies to their native Coun|try, and their native Rights, and Traytors to their lawful Prince, and to their very God, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t &s;acred and bind|ing Oaths which they have taken to the
<PB N="25" REF="34">
contrary. Nay, they exhort and prevail upon tho&s;e Di&s;ciples, to take the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn and binding Oaths to be true to their Prince, their Country, their Religion, and their Liberty, only that they may oppre&s;s them with the greater Security, and betray them more effectually.</P>
<P>Nor is the Doctrine of Antichri&s;t more remov'd from Charity, than his Life, which is the mo&s;t contrary to it that po&s;&s;ibly can be imagined. He divides from his Bre|thren of the Prie&s;thood, as &s;oon as he finds that they are obliged to profe&s;s peaceful and Chri&s;tian Vertues, and that he cannot with them compa&s;s his &s;piritual Tyranny. And St. <HI>John,</HI> in the Words of the Context, makes this very Divi&s;ion one di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of Antichri&s;t. 1 Epi&s;t. of St. <HI>John,</HI> Chap. 2. Ver. 18, 19. <HI>Little children, it is the la&s;t time: and as ye have heard that Anti|chri&s;t &s;hall come, even now are there many An|tichri&s;ts; whereby ye may know that it is the la&s;t time.</HI> Ver. 19. <HI>They went out from us, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey were not of us: for if they had been of us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey would no doubt have continued with us: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ut they went out that they might be made ma|nife&s;t, that they were not at all of us.</HI> He lives, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">onver&s;es with none, preaches to none, but &s;uch as profe&s;s Divi&s;ions; divides from all who are under the Power of the Go&s;pel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the Power of Law; is a Foe, not

only to good Subjects, but to good Princes, and a Friend to Tyrants alone: A Tray|tor not only to his Prince, but to his Coun|try, who&s;e Con&s;titution he attacks by his en&s;laving Doctrines, and his more wretch|ed abject Politicks of ab&s;olute Non-re&s;i&s;t|ance, unconditional Obedience, the mo&s;t in&s;ufferable kind of High Trea&s;on. For if he &s;o ju&s;tly &s;uffers Death, who only at|tempts the Executive Power, what may he not de&s;erve, who audaciou&s;ly attacks, not only all the Legi&s;lative (which includes the Executive,) but the very Law? He not on|ly hates both Princes and Subjects, who govern by, and declare for Law, but hates them with a more envenom'd Hatred, a more felonious Rancour, than ever has been known, upon a mere &s;ecular Account: Re|viles, reproaches, mi&s;repre&s;ents, calumni|ates them, and, as far as lies in his Power, oppre&s;&s;es, ruines, cur&s;es, kills, and damns them.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a profound and a Chri&s;tian Hu|mility, he manife&s;ts a more than Humane Pride; exalts him&s;elf above all that the World calls Great, with his independent Power, his uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion, his indelible Character, and his Right Divine. And that Pride is attended, again&s;t all who oppo&s;e it, with a Rage, an Envy, a Ha|tred, a Malice Inhuman and Diabolical.
<PB N="27" REF="36">
But above all, a di&s;dainful, ridiculous Fury, and an unheard of Cruelty; a Cruelty that &s;pares no Age, no Sex, and no Degree; that has de&s;troy'd entire Nations, the People and their Kings together.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the abject contemptible Con|dition of our Saviour and his Di&s;ciples, be|hold his Oppo&s;ite with pompous Titles, and pompous Equipages, and an Ambition &s;till un&s;atiable. In&s;tead of their Poverty, and their Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, behold him loaded with Benefices, Sinecures, Pluralities, Dig|nities; flowing with Wealth, yet pining &s;till with Avarice.

<P>As his Doctrine is confirmed by his Ex|ample, it is extremely enforced by his man|ner of Delivering it.

And that Doctrine com|prehends, Fir&s;t, the Duties, and, Secondly, the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e Duties likewi&s;e are either, Fir&s;t, purely Moral, or, Secondly, Chri&s;tian. For tho&s;e that are purely Moral, he preaches them coldly, enforces them feebly, dehorts from the con|trary Vices faintly; &s;carce ever mentions tho&s;e which are mo&s;t raging and mo&s;t epi|demical; or if at any time he does mention them, he has nothing in his Air, in his Tone, in his Action, that &s;hews an ardent Concern for the Glory of God, for the Pro|&s;perity of the State that he lives in, or for the Salvation of the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>For the Chri&s;tian Vertues, and e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e of Charity and Humility, his Hearers can never have any Notion of 'em from him. Charity, in his Mouth, dwin|dles to mere giving of Alms, which is but a poor and incon&s;iderable Branch of that Divine Vertue. He &s;eems to be afraid to let his Di&s;ciples &s;o much as hear of the Love of God, and of all Mankind for the &s;ake of God; or if he does at at any time mention it, even that ardent Vertue grows cold in his Mouth, and expires upon his Antichri|&s;tian
<PB N="29" REF="38">
Tongue, &s;carce ever reaching the Ears of his Hearers, much le&s;s piercing their Hearts. His Soul is an utter Stranger to the&s;e Heavenly Emotions, tho&s;e Divine Raptures that inflame the Hearts of the ra|vi&s;h'd Hearers with Seraphick Love. He never &s;o much as preaches one Sermon, never &s;o much as writes one Treati&s;e of that attractive Vertue Humility, the &s;oft and tender Nur&s;e of Charity. He either &s;ays nothing of Patience, Submi&s;&s;ion, For|bearance, Long-&s;uffering, or he preaches them after &s;uch a manner, that in his Mouth they produce Tumult, Fury, Faction, Ri|ot, and Rebellion, and all tho&s;e Diabolical Pa&s;&s;ions and Diabolical Vices, which are &s;o de&s;tructive to the Temporal and Eternal Happine&s;s of Men.</P>
<P>And all the&s;e Duties, both Moral and Chr&s;tian, are but feebly and faintly enfor|ced by the My&s;teries, even tho&s;e &s;tupen|dous My&s;teries, that are capable of &s;upply|ing him with the mo&s;t moving and &s;ubli|me&s;t Eloquence, with a more than humane Force and Fire, and with a Vehemence ir|re&s;i&s;table; tho&s;e My&s;teries &s;o wonderfully important to him&s;elf and to his Hearers, which no Man can believe and &s;peak of as he ought to do, but he mu&s;t alarm and alter Na|ture in the Hearts of all who li&s;ten to him; rai&s;e the mo&s;t tran&s;porting Joy on the one

How does the Dei&s;t &s;mile, and the Athei&s;t laugh, to &s;ee this Preacher di&s;cour&s;e of Death and Judgment, of Heaven and Hell, calmly and without Emotion, who the Moment after|wards, falls into a Flame upon an empty Di&s;pute, of turning to the Ea&s;t, or bowing to an in&s;en&s;ate Altar!</P>
<P>But he who is &s;o unconcerned for the Salvation of the Souls of Men, for the Ho|nour of God, and the Intere&s;t of Religion, comes immediately to be warm and eager, when his own Reputation and his own Intere&s;t are never &s;o little concern'd. And he who daily with Phlegm and Temper hears the Name of his Maker profan'd, his My&s;teries revil'd, his Threatnings defy'd, his Protection renounc'd, nay, and his very Being deny'd, contends warmly and eager|ly for Humane Traditions and Humane In|ventions; for Forms, and Rites, and Ha|bits, and Ceremonies, and whatever &s;erves to nouri&s;h his &s;piritual Pride, and indulge his Lu&s;t of Power.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="40">
But when in order to extingui&s;h Chari|ty, to divide Mankind, and to increa&s;e his own and his Father's &s;piritual Tyranny, he preaches the Doctrine of Devils, preach|es Rage, and Hatred, and Envy, and Ma|lice, then is his Delivery becoming of his Doctrine; then you may behold him burn|ing with Fury, and di&s;torted with Con|vul&s;ions, and both Body and Soul entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the &s;ame infernal Pa&s;&s;ions, which he would excite in his Hearers.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the Influence which &s;uch Doctrines, &s;uch Examples, and &s;uch a Delivery has upon the Minds of Men. We have already hinted, that the De&s;ign of the Devil by Antichri&s;t, is, to take Oc|ca&s;ion from the Chri&s;tian Religion, by which our Saviour de&s;ign'd to unite Mens Affections to him&s;elf and to one another, to introduce a more dangerous and de&s;pe|rate Divi&s;ion among them, than ever had been known before: And now we &s;hall &s;hew, that he &s;o far obtain'd his De&s;ign, that there was a more general Vertue a|mong Men in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Times of Paga|ni&s;m, than there has been &s;ince our Savi|our came into the World, excepting the fir&s;t and mo&s;t primitive Times of Chri&s;tia|nity; that is, tho&s;e Times when the Supreme Magi&s;trate was not as yet Chri&s;tian, and Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts were yet undebauch'd by
<PB N="32" REF="41">
worldly Power and Greatne&s;s; and <HI>Second|ly,</HI> that there is at this time a more gene|ral Vertue in other Places, than there is in the Chri&s;tian World; and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that this Deficiency, and the&s;e Corruptions a|mong Chri&s;tians, have proceeded, and do proceed, from the Antichri&s;tian Lives and Doctrines of &s;everal among their Clergy.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There was a more general Vertue in the Times of Pagani&s;m, than ever there has been &s;ince our Saviour came into the World. In tho&s;e Times of Idolatry, there were more free Nations in the World, than ever there have been &s;ince the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Chri&s;tian Religion. And &s;ince there was more Liberty then, there was more Union, more Ju&s;tice, more Fortitude, more Publick Spirit. For Antichri&s;t, in order to extingui&s;h Charity, and to rai&s;e Divi&s;ions among Men, makes it his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, with all his Might, every where to e&s;tabli&s;h Tyranny. For as Civil Liberty is founded upon Vertue, and Rea&s;on, and Law; Tyranny is e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon Will, and Pa&s;&s;ion, and Vice: And as Mankind is united by Rea&s;on, and Vertue, and Law, they are divided by Humour, and Pa&s;&s;ion, and Vice. Among tho&s;e free States that flouri&s;hed in the Times of Pagani&s;m, there were two more illu&s;trious than the re&s;t, who before Corruption crept in among&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="42">
them, had the Moral Vertues in &s;o high a Degree, as no Chri&s;tian Nation has ever been able to boa&s;t of. There was a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Race of Heroes among them, who had not only a Temperance and Ju&s;tice, a Va|lour, but even a Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and Mag|nanimity, and an Height of Heroic Forti|tude, which made them as much &s;uperiour to other Men, as other Men are to Bea&s;ts. Nay, without being taught Charity by Divine Revelation, or &s;u&s;tained in it by the Greatne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Hope, they practi&s;ed a very good Degree of it, either by the Force of Rea&s;on and Nature, or by &s;ome &s;ecret In&s;piration. For they had a Publick Vertue and Publick Spirit, which the Chri&s;tian World has thought more pro|per for its Wonder, than Imitation. They loved Liberty and their Country more than Life, hated Slavery more than Death, look|ed upon all who favour'd Tyrants, as &s;o many Mon&s;ters and Parricides, and pur&s;u|ed Tyranny with extreme Vengeance, even in their neare&s;t Friends and their deare&s;t Relations. They laid down their Lives with the greate&s;t Alacrity, for their Coun|try and the Publick Liberty, and never u&s;ed their Valour again&s;t either. They never had any Faction or Divi&s;ion upon a Religious Account, had but few Civil Wars among them, and not one Religious, ex|cept

the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who had degenerated into &s;o Be&s;tial a Fanatici&s;m, as made them contemptible to the re&s;t of the World, which ea&s;ily under&s;tood by the Force of Rea&s;on, that Religion was de&s;ign'd to u|nite and compo&s;e, and not to divide and embroil the World.</P>
<P>If from ancient <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> we turn our Eyes upon our own Nation, and upon our own Times, where &s;hall we find the lea&s;t Foot&s;teps of their general publick, or private Vertue? That we have not &s;o much as the Shadow of their general pub|lick Vertues, is plain, even to Sen&s;e; for we &s;ee Thou&s;ands among us di&s;claiming all Pretence to it. We &s;ee Thou&s;ands that &s;peak and act with Impunity again&s;t their Sovereign, their Country, their Liberty, and their Laws; Per&s;ons again&s;t whom tho&s;e Laws have made no Provi&s;ion, be|cau&s;e that our Ance&s;tors never believed that there could be &s;uch Mon&s;ters and Parricides in Nature. We &s;ee Thou&s;ands openly threatning De&s;truction to their Country, their Friends, their Relations, and to every thing that ought to be mo&s;t dear to them; and contriving Succe&s;s to the Mortal Enemy, of all that ought to be valuable, of all that ought to be &s;acred to to them. Since then we have not the ge|neral publick Vertue, nor publick Spirit,
<PB N="35" REF="44">
whieh rendred tho&s;e ancient States &s;o illu|&s;trious; it follows, that we have not their general private Vertues. For publick Spi|rit is founded upon private Vertue, and is the nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of that; &s;o that thro' whatever Nation publick Spirit is &s;pread, through that Nation private Vertue mu&s;t be generally diffu&s;ed. And therefore, if we daily &s;ee &s;o many attempting the Ruine of their Country, 'tis becau&s;e their Pride, their Avarice, their Nece&s;&s;ity, and their Luxu|ry, have made their pre&s;ent Condition in|&s;upportable, and any Change de&s;irable. But if any one thinks tho&s;e ancient States ow'd their general Vertue to the Forms of their Government, which were both Republicks, to him we an&s;wer, that no modern Re|publick either hath, or has had, the Vertue which tho&s;e ancient States had: Be&s;ides, that <HI>Rome</HI> was vertuous under its Kings, and &s;o was <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Macedon</HI> among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> as likewi&s;e <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in the Times of its fir&s;t Monarchs.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> If we con&s;ider only our own Times we &s;hall find a more general Vertue, both publick and private, in any Civiliz'd Nation upon the Globe, than in tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tian World. Ca&s;t your Eyes, for Example, among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> you &s;hall find among them le&s;s Ambition, le&s;s Avarice, le&s;s Luxury, le&s;s Fraud, le&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="45">
Inju&s;tice, le&s;s Perjury, le&s;s Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, than you &s;hall meet with among Chri&s;ti|ans. You &s;hall find, that while every Chri|&s;tian State is at pre&s;ent engaged again&s;t &s;ome other Chri&s;tian Nation, in a de&s;perate bloody Contention, that the&s;e Infidels at the &s;ame time have no Wars with tho&s;e of their own Religion; but that <HI>Mahometans</HI> with <HI>Mahometans,</HI> the <HI>Ottoman</HI> with the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> with the <HI>Mogul,</HI> living in Friend&s;hip and a profound Peace, li&s;ten with a&s;toni&s;h'd Ears to the numberle&s;s, endle&s;s Quarrels of the Sons of Charity. What Opinion mu&s;t they conceive of our Religion, when they find, that the only Per&s;ons who profe&s;s the Practice of Chari|ty, are they who live in endle&s;s Wars with tho&s;e of their own Faith? That they are not only eternally engaged in Civil Wars, which are &s;o rare among them&s;elves, but even in Wars unheard of among the Infi|dels, and which they cannot think of with|out Horrour, I mean in Wars of Religion? What Opinion mu&s;t they conceive of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and of the Faith of tho&s;e who pretend to teach others Charity, when they find that our very Prie&s;ts, tho&s;e Dove-like Me&s;&s;engers of the Prince of Peace, have been the Cau&s;es, the Abettors, and the Incendiaries of all tho&s;e Eoreign, and Dome&s;tick, and Religious Wars a|mong

Name of the ble&s;&s;ed Founder of our Reli|gion, as the mo&s;t profligate Lay Man that ever was upon the Earth is entituled the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But <HI>Thirdly,</HI> if we con&s;ider only our own Nation, and our own Times, compared with tho&s;e of our Ance&s;tors, we &s;hall find that there was among them a more general publick and private Vertue, than we our &s;elves can boa&s;t of; and that Prie&s;tcraft and Athei&s;m, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hypocri&s;y and Laical Dei&s;m, Right Divine and Socinia|ni&s;m, Non-Re&s;i&s;tance and Publick Trea&s;on, Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and unnatural prodigi|ous Luxury, have grown up and increas'd together.</P>
<P>Since then there neither is, nor has been, among Chri&s;tians, the general publick and private Vertue, that there was in the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t Times of Pagani&s;m; nor is there now in the Chri&s;tian World the &s;ame degree of Vertue that is to be found in &s;ome other Parts of the Globe; nor have we, in our own Nation, as much general publick and private Vertue as our Ance&s;tors formerly had; and we yet profe&s;s a Religion more pure than our Ance&s;tors formerly knew; a Religion that teaches a more perfect and exalted Vertue, than the Religion, or the Philo&s;ophy of the <HI>Graecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> taught, or than is taught by any Reli|gion
<PB N="39" REF="48">
that is at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h'd out of the Chri&s;tian World: It follows, that the want of general Vertue among Modern Chri&s;tians, mu&s;t proceed from the Hear|ers, or the Teachers, of Chri&s;tianity. But from the Hearers it cannot proceed; for Men are by Nature the &s;ame that they were formerly; have the &s;ame Force of Under&s;tanding; the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ionate and ardent De&s;ire to be rightly in&s;tructed, and to be truly happy; and are the more a|dapted and prepared for In&s;truction and for Happine&s;s by a greater Light of Know|ledge, and a greater Experience of Things.</P>
<P>The Fault being neither in the Doctrine, nor in the Hearers, it follows, that the want of general Vertue mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome of the Teachers, who contaminate the Doctrine of Chri&s;t by their own In|ventions, and the Doctrines of Devils. But that the want of general Vertue among us, and our deplorable Corruption of Manners, does principally proceed from the fore&s;aid Cau&s;e, is evident from that which follows.</P>
<P>A general Vertue depends upon Reli|gion; for all Vertue proceeds from good Sen&s;e, or is the Re&s;ult of Religion: But not one Man in fifty having good Sen&s;e, a general Vertue mu&s;t be the Re&s;ult of Re|ligion; which is likewi&s;e proved by Ex|perience: For all States thro' which a ge|neral
<PB N="40" REF="49">
Vertue has been &s;pread, have been at the &s;ame time Religious.</P>
<P>But here we ought to ob&s;erve, that the Religion upon which a general Vertue de|pends, mu&s;t be a revealed Religion: For natural Religion &s;peaks to cultivate Rea|&s;on, which is &s;o rarely found among us; but Revelation &s;peaks to Sen&s;e, which is common to all Men.</P>
<P>But of all Revelations, the Chri&s;tian Religion is mo&s;t proper, even without the help of &s;upernatural A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to e&s;tabli&s;h a general (both publick and private) Ver|tue: The publick, becau&s;e 'tis the only Religion that teaches Charity; which Di|vine Vertue is the very Height and Perfe|ction of publick Spirit: The private, be|cau&s;e every Vertue is comprehended in Charity, and becau&s;e the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion has provided the mo&s;t effectual Re|medies for the three chief Cau&s;es of the Corruption of Manners; which are, in the Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life.</HI></P>
<P>Now every Religion, like every Go|vernment, is, humanly &s;peaking, main|tain'd by the very &s;ame Methods by which that particular Religion was at fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd; as that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which began by the Sword, was maintained and carried on by the Sword; and the Modern <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="50">
Religion is maintain'd by the &s;ame Force and the &s;ame Fraud to which it owed its Origin. And every Religion lo&s;es its Force by the contrary Methods to the&s;e which at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed it.</P>
<P>As then the Chri&s;tian Religion was at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Doctrine of Charity, and by the great Examples of Charity, which our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles gave through the whole cour&s;e of their Lives, as it was maintain'd by the &s;ame Metho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s; So Chri&s;tian Piety cannot only decay, by the Antichri&s;tian Lives, and Antichri|&s;tian Doctrines, of tho&s;e who pretend to teach it.</P>
<P>Since then a general Vertue in every Nation depends upon the Revelation e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd there, whether true or pretended; and the Revelation e&s;tabli&s;hed in every Nation is maintained by the &s;ame Methods to which it owed its Origin, and lo&s;es its Force by the contrary Methods as far as it can humanly lo&s;e it: And &s;ince the Chri&s;tian Revelation owes its E&s;tabli&s;h|ment to the Doctrine and Examples of Cha|rity, which &s;hone in its fir&s;t Teachers; it follows, that the want of a general Vertue, and that deplorable Corruption of Man|ners that reigns among us, are owing to the uncharitable Doctrines and Examples
<PB N="42" REF="51">
of &s;ome of the Modern Teachers of Chri|&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Thus we have done our Endeavour to &s;hew how Antichri&s;t &s;tands oppo&s;ed to Chri&s;t in his Prie&s;thood, and in his Ty|ranny. We &s;hall only &s;ay one Word of his Oppo&s;ition to him as a Prophet. And becau&s;e we have rea&s;on to fear that we have been already tedious, we &s;hall pa&s;s by the other Prophetical Functions, which are &s;o nearly ally'd to tho&s;e of the Prie&s;thood, and only ju&s;t &s;ay &s;omething of his Predi|ctions. Our Saviour foretold the De&s;tru|ction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and of the Second Tem|ple, to confirm the Faith of Chri&s;tians, and to augment their Charity, by &s;hewing how little Dependance is to be had upon the Pomp and Glories of this World, and up|on outward and appearing Sanctity. An|tichri&s;t foretells the Fall of the Third Tem|ple, which our Saviour has a&s;&s;ur'd us &s;hall never fall, only that he may divide and embroil the World, and extingui&s;h Cha|rity. For the Danger of the Church has now for &s;ome time been the general Out|cry. But may we not have Leave to ask tho&s;e many Antichri&s;ts, when they &s;ay the Church is in Danger, What they mean by the Church, and of whom it is com|pos'd? What the Danger is with which it is threatned? Or, from whom or whence
<PB N="43" REF="52">
it mu&s;t come? May we not have Leave to ask them one plain Que&s;tion? Are the Souls of Men to whom they preach in dan|ger? If they are not, why do they preach to them? But if they are, is that the Dan|ger they &s;peak of when they &s;ay the Church is in Danger? Or, is it another Danger? If they &s;ay 'tis another Danger, can any thing be more ridiculous? Can any thing be more ab&s;urd, when the grand Concern, nay, the only Concern, the very All of tho&s;e to whom they &s;peak lies at Stake, to allarm them with Trifles? For what com|par'd to that is not a Trifle? There is not one of them that preaches to a very nu|merous Congregation, but every Sermon which he preaches is the la&s;t to &s;ome of them, to one of them at lea&s;t. And who knows when they are a&s;&s;embled, who that one may be? Who knows how near he him&s;elf is to Death and final Judgment? How near to a Danger horrible even to conceive? And can this fooli&s;h, this tri|fling, this impudent Preacher pretend to allarm them with another Danger, a Peril of &s;omething more remote, a Peril perhaps in Fancy or in Fiction only; a Danger, be it what it will, that is not worth a Mo|ment's Thought, compared to this &s;tupen|dious Danger? Is not this like putting a Man in mind, who is about to peri&s;h in a

Storm, a thou&s;and Leagues off from Shore, ju&s;t in the Moment that the Ocean opens her dreadful Aby&s;s to &s;wallow him, of put|ting him in mind of &s;ome trifling Lo&s;s that he is like to &s;u&s;tain on Shore? Would not this be a barbarous, would not this be a mon&s;trous mocking of him, ju&s;t in the terrible Moment that he is about to pe|ri&s;h? Would it not be, by &s;o much the more barbarous, by &s;o much the more mon|&s;trous, in that it &s;hould come from one who mu&s;t be about to peri&s;h with him?</P>
<P>But if by this Danger, he means the Danger of Damnation, which the Souls are in to whom he preaches; from what or whence is this Danger fear'd? Is it from the actual and habitual Sins of his Hearers? Or, have they &s;o few of both, that they are at lei&s;ure to apprehend Dam|nation from &s;omething more foreign and more remote? If 'tis from their actual and habitual Sins, and that extream Corrup|tion which reigns in the Congregation to which he preaches; for in what Congre|gations at pre&s;ent does not extream Cor|ruption reign? Is not this a fooli&s;h, is not this an impudent in&s;ulting of them? Have &s;ome certain Preachers brought them into this Danger? And is it in their Power to help them out of it? And are they con|tented with barely threatning it? Has it
<PB N="45" REF="54">
not been made clear and mo&s;t per&s;picuous, that the extream Corruption of the Laity, proceeds from the Antichri&s;tian Doctrines, proceeds from the Antichri&s;tian Practices of &s;ome certain Preachers? Let but tho&s;e Preachers reform their Doctrines, and re|form their Practices, and I'll engage that the wretched Laity &s;hall reform immedi|ately.</P>
<P>But alas! the Danger that tho&s;e Preach|ers threaten, is not from the Sins of the People to whom they preach; is not from the extream Corruption of Manners that reigns in their Congregations. For when have the&s;e Prophets ever inveighed again&s;t their mo&s;t predominant Vices? By what Sermons have they ever &s;ignaliz'd them|&s;elves again&s;t their Ambition, again&s;t their Avarice, again&s;t their Oppre&s;&s;ions, their publick and private Rapines, again&s;t their new, their unheard of, their unnatural Luxuries? Did they ever threaten them with Danger from the&s;e? Are they really in no Danger from the&s;e? Are they not in a thou&s;and times more Danger from the&s;e, than they can be from any thing el&s;e in the World? if they are, why are they not told &s;o? if they are not, from what wonderful, what unconceivable thing is it from which they are more in Danger?</P>

From what has been &s;aid, 'tis plain that by the Danger of the Church, the&s;e Preach|ers mean not the Danger of Damnation which their Hearers are in from their nu|merous and crying Sins. It follows then, that they mean &s;omething that is of no Con|cern to their Hearers: for if they would &s;peak of things that are of any Concern to them, why not their main, their whole, their tremendous Concern? Why do they omit that, and threaten them with Trifles? Why do they either not mention it, or while they mention, &s;peak of it &s;o very coldly; they who while they &s;peak of the Danger of the Church, declaim &s;o very warmly? Is it not &s;hrewdly to be &s;u&s;pe|cted, that by the Church they mean them|&s;elves, mean their own Intere&s;ts and their own Power? O fooli&s;h and mi&s;erable Lai|ty! to be &s;o much allarm'd, and deluded, and divided by the&s;e, who are &s;o cool, &s;o unconcern'd for you; &s;o very warm, and &s;o very much concern'd for them&s;elves! who not only neglect your real Dangers, but by fal&s;ly allarming you with imaginary ones, bring you into the only real, the only dreadful Danger. For let me ask you once more, What is this pretended Dan|ger of the Church? Is it the Danger of the Catholick Church, again&s;t the which our Saviour has told us, that <HI>the gates of</HI>

<HI>Hell &s;hall not prevail?</HI> Is not this A&s;&s;urance enough, that it &s;hall not fall? Or are &s;ome Prie&s;ts more dangerous than the Devil? Or, by the Danger of the Church, do they mean the Di&s;cipline and the Government of &s;ome particular Church? As for Exam|ple, the Di&s;cipline and the Government of the National Church of <HI>England?</HI> Are the&s;e in Danger to be alter'd? Suppo&s;ing they were: The&s;e are Things, by the Confe&s;&s;ion of all, of no Nece&s;&s;ity to Salvation; and Things, by the Confe&s;&s;ion of all but them|&s;elves, at liberty to be alter'd in every Na|tion, at the Will of their Legi&s;lators. And con&s;equently, if this Danger were real, it would be of no Significancy to their Hear|ers. But this Danger is not real; and no Shadow of Proof has been brought to &s;hew, that the Di&s;cipline and Government of the Church are in any manner of Perils; nay, unan&s;werable Arguments have been brought to prove, that they are not in Danger. O fooli&s;h and wretched People! to be thus in|cen&s;ed and exa&s;perated again&s;t each other, by the vain fear of a fictitious Danger; which, were in true, would be Ten thou|&s;and times le&s;s than the Danger into which it brings you; a Danger, which, by the Confe&s;&s;ion of all, is the mo&s;t real, and mo&s;t horrible of all Dangers; the Danger of Eter|nal Damnation from your want of Charity.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="57">
The exacte&s;t Di&s;cipline of the mo&s;t Per|fect Church is only in order to the &s;aving of Souls. The De&s;ign of our Saviour's coming into the World, was to &s;ave Souls, and not to e&s;tabli&s;h Di&s;cipline: For where is the Di&s;cipline which our Saviour e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd? Can any thinking Man believe, that our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who came to pull down the Partition Wall that was between the <HI>Jews</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by a|boli&s;hing the Ceremonial Law, and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Na|tion, could ever de&s;ign another certain Di&s;|cipline, and other certain Ceremonies, which he could not but fore&s;ee would create a Divi&s;ion among his future Di&s;ci|ples? But Antichri&s;t de&s;igns, by de&s;troying Charity, to damn Souls, that he may pre|&s;erve Di&s;cipline. 'Tis the Danger that Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline is in, at which he is con&s;tantly allarm'd. O vain and impudent Pretence! For &s;uppo&s;e the Danger true, as it is certainly mo&s;t fal&s;e, how very fooli&s;h mu&s;t that Preacher be, who pretends to be allarm'd at any thing more, than the Dan|ger of tho&s;e Souls which alone he prea|ches to &s;ave, than the Danger of tho&s;e Souls for which alone our Saviour di|ed? How many of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Souls have been for ever lo&s;t, while they have been hearkning to the Danger of the

Church, and dying impenitent in Hatred and in devili&s;h Malice, by the In&s;tigation of the&s;e their Pa&s;tors again&s;t their innocent Brethren; have, to their Everla&s;ting Con|fu&s;ion, found in Hell that the Church is not in Danger!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Thus I have given you the Marks by which Antichri&s;t &s;tands oppos'd to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a King, a Prie&s;t, and a Prophet. I &s;hall now &s;um up all tho&s;e Marks in one grand Characteri&s;tical Mark, that as we have &s;hewn above that Anti|chri&s;t is a Prie&s;t, &s;o it may be plain to the meane&s;t Capacity who the&s;e Prie&s;ts are of whom it may be &s;aid, in the Words of the Text, <HI>Even now there are many Anti|chri&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Every Prie&s;t then, who, when he prea|ches, does apparently and maliciou&s;ly wre&s;t the Go&s;pel, or the Epi&s;tles which explain the Go&s;pel, to &s;ay &s;omething that is quite contrary to the great De&s;ign of our Savi|viour, that Prie&s;t is Antichri&s;t. Now the great De&s;ign of our Saviour in preaching the Go&s;pel of his Kingdom, was to do principally two Things; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to re&s;tore the Law of Nature; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> to re|vive and re&s;tore Charity.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The great De&s;ign of our Saviour's coming into the World, was to re&s;tore and fulfil the Law of Nature. <HI>Matt.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 17.
<PB N="50" REF="59">
<HI>Think not that I came to de&s;troy the Law and the Prophets, I am not come to de&s;troy but to fulfil.</HI> And Ver. 18. <HI>For verily I &s;ay unto you, till heaven and earth pa&s;s, one jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law, till all be fulfilled.</HI> Now, what was the Law that our Saviour came to fulfil? Not the Ceremonial Law; for that he came to di&s;annul. Epi&s;t. to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Chap. 6. Ver. 18. <HI>For there is verily a di&s;annulling of the commandment going before for the weak|ne&s;s and unprofitablene&s;s thereof.</HI> Ver. 19. <HI>For the law made nothing perfect.</HI> And what Law is it which our Saviour &s;ays mu&s;t re|main to the End of the World? Not the Ceremonial Law, for that is already abo|li&s;h'd. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. Ver. 8, 9. <HI>Above, when he &s;aid, &s;acrifice and offering, and burnt-offering, thou would&s;t not, neither had&s;t plea&s;ure therein, which are offered by the law. Then he &s;aid, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the fir&s;t, that he may e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd.</HI> Now, what is this Second Law which our Saviour came to e&s;tabli&s;h? What but the Law of Nature, or the Moral Law; as ap|pears by the foremention'd Chapter, Ver. 16. <HI>This is the covenant that I will make with them, after tho&s;e days, faith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.</HI> Since then the great De&s;ign of our Saviour's Doctrine was
<PB N="51" REF="60">
to re&s;tore the Law of Nature, every Prie&s;t who wre&s;ts the Go&s;pel, or the Epi&s;tles which explain the Go&s;pel, to &s;ay any thing which offends again&s;t the Law of Nature, that Prie&s;t is Antichri&s;t. Now the elde&s;t of Nature's Laws, and that which Man is the harde&s;t brought to violate, by the una|nimous Confe&s;&s;ion of all who have treated of it, is Self-Pre&s;ervation. But this is mo&s;t evident, that without Self-Defence the Law of Self-Pre&s;ervation cannot be kept invio|lated; and that without Re&s;i&s;tance there can be no Self-Defence. Whatever Prie&s;t then pretends to make the Scripture &s;ay any thing again&s;t any manner of Re&s;i&s;t|ance of unju&s;t Violence, that is nece&s;&s;ary to Self-Pre&s;ervation, the elde&s;t Law of Na|ture, this Law which God has put in our Hearts, and has writ in our Minds, and which only the Devil and his Di&s;ciples can ever de&s;ign to deface; that Prie&s;t is as much oppo&s;ed to our Saviour, as any thing po&s;&s;ibly can be oppo&s;ed; and is therefore one of the many of whom we may &s;ay in the Words of the Text, <HI>Even now there are many Antichri&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> The other great De&s;ign of our Saviour's Doctrine was to re&s;tore Cha|rity. Go&s;p. of St <HI>John,</HI> Chap. 15. Ver. 12. <HI>This is my commandment, that ye love one another.</HI> And this great De&s;ign compre|hends
<PB N="52" REF="61">
the other, <HI>viz.</HI> the re&s;toring of the Law of Nature, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. Ver. 15. <HI>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> And <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. Ver. 8, 9, 10. <HI>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth ano|ther hath fulfilled the law.</HI> v. 9. <HI>For this, thou &s;halt not commit adultery, thou &s;halt not kill, thou &s;halt not &s;teal, thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e wit|ne&s;s, thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> v. 10. <HI>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</HI> Thus Charity includes the Law of Nature. But it likewi&s;e includes a great deal more. For by the Law of Nature, as it &s;tands now, is meant only that which can be gathered by the Light of Rea&s;on: but the Law of Charity includes more than what can be gather'd from the Light of corrupted Rea&s;on, and is the fir&s;t Law of Nature which was given to <HI>Adam</HI> in his State of Perfection, 1 Epi&s;t. of St. <HI>John,</HI> Chap. 3. ver&s;. 11. <HI>For this is the me&s;&s;age that ye have heard from the beginning, that we &s;hould love one another.</HI> Charity is the great|e&s;t of all the Chri&s;tian Vertues; by which alone our Saviour tells us, <HI>Matt.</HI> 25. <HI>that men will be &s;aved at the la&s;t day</HI>; and for want of which alone he tells us, <HI>they will be damned</HI>;
<PB N="53" REF="62">
than which nothing can be more rea&s;onable and more ju&s;t: For all other Vertues are but in order to, and as it were the &s;caffolding of that; and are included in that. When that is perfect, the re&s;t &s;hall cea&s;e to be; and all &s;hall at la&s;t be &s;wallow'd up in Charity: which &s;hall make the Felicity of the Ble&s;|&s;ed Ten thou&s;and Ages, after Temperance, Prudence, and Fortitude, nay, after Faith and Hope them&s;elves &s;hall have been no more. Now Charity being the only Vertue that reigns in Heaven, he who has not been habituated to it on Earth, would go thi|ther like a Stranger to a remote Country, who&s;e Language and Cu&s;toms are both unknown to him, and entirely different from his own; and where, by Con&s;equence, he could neither keep any Company, nor find any Plea&s;ure. The Advancement of Charity then was the great De&s;ign of our Saviour's coming into the World; for the Advancement of Charity is the Salvation of Souls: And therefore, that Prie&s;t who wre&s;ts the Scripture to &s;ay any thing de|&s;tructive of that, is emphatically Anti|chri&s;t.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul,</HI> by what he has &s;aid of Cha|rity in the 13th Chapter of the 1&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> has &s;et before us &s;everal Marks to know when the Scripture is
<PB N="54" REF="63">
wre&s;ted to the De&s;truction of that Divine Vertue.</P>
<P><HI>Charity,</HI> &s;ays he, Ver. 4. <HI>&s;uffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it &s;elf, is not puffed up,</HI> v. 5. <HI>Doth not behave it &s;elf un&s;eemly; &s;eeketh not her own; is not ea&s;ily provoked; thinketh no evil</HI>; v. 6. <HI>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth</HI>; v. 7. <HI>Beareth all things, belie|veth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</HI> From which it is plain, that what|ever Prie&s;t makes u&s;e of the Scripture to &s;tir up Divi&s;ion among&s;t Men, to nouri&s;h their Malice, their Envy, their Pride; to rai&s;e groundle&s;s Fears and Jealou&s;ies among them, and to de&s;troy the Confidence which Members of Societies mutually have in each other, and to compa&s;s all this by impudent ill manner'd Invectives, and a &s;ort of Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI>; that Prie&s;t wre&s;ts the Scripture to &s;ay &s;omething that is ve|ry de&s;tructive of Charity, and is empha|tically Antichri&s;t.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more &s;ea&s;onable, than here to con&s;ider, what the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>James</HI> &s;ays of the Tongues of &s;uch Men, and them&s;elves, <HI>Jam.</HI> 3. ver. 6. <HI>The tongue is a fire; a world of iniquity: So is the tongue among the members, that it defileth the whole body, and &s;etteth on fire the cour&s;e of nature, and is &s;et on fire of hell.</HI> v. 7. <HI>For</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="64">
<HI>every kind of bea&s;ts, and of birds, and of &s;er|pents, and of things in the &s;ea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind.</HI> v. 8. <HI>But the tongue can no man tame: it is abundantly evil: full of deadly poi&s;on.</HI> v. 9. <HI>Therewith ble&s;s we God, even the Father, and therewith cur&s;e we men, which are made after the &s;imilitude of God.</HI> v. 10. <HI>Out of the &s;ame mouth proceedeth ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing. My brethren, the&s;e things ought not &s;o to be.</HI> v. 11. <HI>Doth a fountain &s;end forth at the &s;ame time &s;weet water and bitter.</HI> v. 12. <HI>Can the Fig-tree, my brethren, bear Olive-berries? either a Vine Figs? So can no fountain yield both &s;alt water and fre&s;h.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle declares in the following Ver&s;es, that the&s;e Church-Incendiaries who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to cur&s;e, when 'tis their Duty to ble&s;s, who are agitated with Rage, and Envy, and Malice, have a Spirit in them that is directly contrary to the Spirit of the Go&s;pel; ver. 13. <HI>Who is a wi&s;e man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him &s;hew, out of a good conver&s;ation, his works, with meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom.</HI> v. 14. <HI>But if ye have bitter envying and &s;trife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not again&s;t the truth.</HI> v. 15. <HI>This wi&s;dom de&s;cendeth not from above, but is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h.</HI> v. 16. <HI>For where envying and &s;trife is, there is confu&s;ion, and every evil work.</HI> After that the Apo&s;tle has, in &s;everal of the fore&s;aid Ver&s;es, &s;hewn
<PB N="56" REF="65">
you the Spirit of Antichri&s;t; in the fol|lowing Ver&s;es he de&s;cribes the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, ver. 17. <HI>But the wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle and ea&s;ie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;ie.</HI> And in the next Ver&s;e he tells us the Effects of it; v. 18. <HI>And the fruit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;own in peace of them that make peace.</HI> But alas! how little is there of this Wi&s;dom, this Spirit, and this Fruit among &s;ome Modern Preachers!</P>
<P>Thus St. <HI>James</HI> declares Railing to be con|trary to the Spirit of Charity, and con&s;e|quently of Chri&s;tianity. And this is the una|nimous Sen&s;e both of the Apo&s;tles, and of the Evangeli&s;ts: and that it is never to be al|low'd of again&s;t any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, upon any Pretence or Occa&s;ion whatever, let the Crime be never &s;o great, or &s;o horrible. The greate&s;t Crime that ever was committed, was the fir&s;t; the Apo|&s;tacy of <HI>Lucifer</HI> from his Creator; the greate&s;t of Sins, excepting the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and equal even to that: like that &s;o great, that it was never to be attoned for by any Repentance, and never to be forgiven. Yet <HI>Michael</HI> the Archan|gel, when contending with the Devil, he di&s;puted about the Body of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> dur&s;t not bring again&s;t him a railing Accu&s;a|tion,
<PB N="57" REF="66">
but &s;aid, <HI>the Lord rebuke thee.</HI> The great|e&s;t Crime next to the&s;e, was the murdering of the Lord of Life: And yet we find not in any of the Apo&s;tles, or in any one of the Evangeli&s;ts, the lea&s;t Invective, or the lea&s;t Bitterne&s;s, again&s;t <HI>Judas</HI> who betray'd him, or the High Prie&s;t who condemn'd him, or <HI>Pilate</HI> who deliver d him to the Soldiers, or the Soldiers who mock'd and &s;courg'd and crucify'd him. And will our Mo|dern Antichri&s;ts after this pretend to take Occa|&s;ion from the Go&s;pel of Peace to rail? Will they yet further defend their Railing, by wre&s;ting the Scriptures &s;till more to their own De&s;truction, and the De&s;truction of their credulous Hearers? Shall the 4th Chapter of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to <HI>Ti|tus</HI> be brought to ju&s;tifie this Spirit of Antichri&s;t: <HI>I charge thee therefore before God</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Ti|tus,</HI> Chap. 4. Ver. 1.) <HI>and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing, and his kingdom,</HI> ver. 2. <HI>Preach the word, be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-&s;uffering and doctrine.</HI> To what is it that the Apo&s;tle in this Chapter exhorts <HI>Titus?</HI> Why to preach the Word in Sea&s;on and out of Sea&s;on, that is, to preach the Son of God, and the Do|ctrine of Charity. And &s;hall this be made u&s;e of to ju&s;tifie preaching up Divi&s;ion, Di&s;&s;ention, Sedition, and the Doctrines of Devils? Shall the Apo&s;tle's Exhortation to reprove, and to rebuke, be made u&s;e of to vindicate want of Manners, and &s;uch Rudene&s;s as better becomes a drunken Bully than a &s;ober Divine, and a midnight Tavern
<PB N="58" REF="67">
than a Pulpit? e&s;pecially when St. <HI>Jude</HI> in the 9th Ver&s;e of his Epi&s;tle mention'd above, has as it were oppos'd Rebuking to Railing, telling us, that the Archangel <HI>Michael</HI> dur&s;t not bring a rail|ing Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Devil, but only &s;aid, <HI>The Lord rebuke thee.</HI> And St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells <HI>Titus</HI> in this very Ver&s;e, <HI>that his rebuking, and reproving, and exhorting, mu&s;t be with all long-&s;uffering, and with doctrine,</HI> that is, with Charity. The true Chri&s;ti|an is certainly the be&s;t well-manner'd Man in the World, if that be the true&s;t good Breeding, which makes a Man mo&s;t ea&s;ie, both to him&s;elf and o|thers: and no Man who calls him&s;elf a Chri&s;ti|an ever wanted Manners, but that Man at the &s;ame time wanted both Faith and Charity. But if no manner of Railing, in order to excite Envy and Hatred, and Rage, and Malice, is allow'd of by the Chri&s;tian Religion, then certainly the mo&s;t Criminal of all Railings mu&s;t be that which is pretended to be drawn from this very Religion, which by its principal Commands, a Command comprehen&s;ive of all its Commands, obliges us to hare no Man, and to rail at no Man. But as the Railing of our Modern Preachers can by no means be ju&s;tified by St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s exhorting, rebuking and reproving; can the grievous Sufferings of that A|po&s;tle for the &s;ake of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the preaching of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, be compared to a ju&s;t and a moderate Puni&s;hment inflicted by an offended Legi&s;lature, for the preaching Divi&s;ion and Sedition, and the Doctrine of Devils? e&s;pe|cially when this very Apo&s;tle has told us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="68">
13. ver. 3. <HI>Tho' I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profitteth me nothing.</HI> From which we may conclude, that many a Martyr has gone to Hell, and pa&s;s'd from one Flame to another. Is there no difference between a light Suffering and a heavy one, a nominal one and a real one, a ju&s;t one and an unju&s;t one? Is there no difference be|tween doing the Work of Chri&s;t, and the Work of the Devil and his Angels? With whom I will not &s;ay, according to their own charitable Chri|&s;tian way of dealing, that I will leave the&s;e well|natur'd Preachers, tho' 'tis with the Company they have always kept, as, I believe, has been made pretty plain; but I humbly pray to Al|mighty God to deliver them out of the Hands of their old Acquaintance, who fir&s;t &s;educed them and debauched them, and whom, as is manife&s;t by their Works, they &s;till frequent continually; and of who&s;e Hou&s;e and Family they may mo&s;t properly be &s;aid to be; 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. ver. 10. <HI>In this the children of God are manife&s;ted, and the children of the devil: who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God, nor be who loveth not his brother.</HI> We pray to God to deliver them from the&s;e wicked Spirits by a &s;incere Repentance, for all the Mi&s;chief which they have done them&s;elves, and for all which they have been the Occa&s;ion of in others&punc; for all the Antichri&s;tian Hatred, that is, for all the Murder of which they have been guilty them|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and of which &s;o many Thou&s;ands have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> guilty by the Sugge&s;tion of them and the Devil. For St. <HI>John</HI> tells us in the 15th Ver&s;e of
<PB N="60" REF="69">
the foremention'd Chapter, <HI>Who&s;o hateth his bro|ther is a murderer.</HI> The Rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e whoever hates another would kill him, if he were not re&s;train'd by the fear of Corporal Puni&s;hment. For this is evident, that he is not re&s;train'd by the Law of Nature, nor by the po&s;itive Law of God; not by the Law of Nature, becau&s;e that obliges him not to hate him, by its great and comprehen|&s;ive Rule of doing as one would be done by; for no Man is willing to be hated by another: nor is he re&s;trained by the po&s;itive Law of God, becau&s;e that obliges him not to hate him. It follows then, that he is only aw'd by the fear of Corporal Pu|ni&s;hment. And how often has this Religious Ha|tred, this Hatred excited by Antichri&s;t and the Devil, broke out in Wars, in Murders, in Burn|ings, and in Ma&s;&s;acres? How near did it come to the&s;e Confu&s;ions and the&s;e Horrours lately! How &s;oon would it yet come to them, if it were not re|&s;train'd by the Wi&s;dom of our Legi&s;lators.
