<P>_THE notice, Your MAJESTY has conde&s;cended to take of the following <HI>Tragedy,</HI> emboldens me to lay it, in the humble&s;t manner, at Your MAJESTY'S Feet. And to whom can this illu&s;trious <HI>Carthaginian</HI> &s;o properly fly for protection, as to a QUEEN, who commands the hearts of a <HI>People,</HI> more powerful at &s;ea than <HI>Carthage?</HI> more flouri&s;hing in <HI>com|merce</HI> than tho&s;e <HI>fir&s;t Merchants?</HI> more &s;ecure again&s;t conque&s;t? and, under a
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Monarchy,</HI> more free than a <HI>Common|wealth</HI> it&s;elf?</P>
<P>I dare not, nor indeed need I, here attempt a character, where both the great and the amiable Qualities &s;hine forth in full perfection. All words are faint to &s;peak what is univer&s;ally felt, and acknowledged, by a happy people. Permit me therefore only to &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf, with the true&s;t zeal and vene|ration,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is not my intention, in this preface, to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece. I am afraid there are too many: But tho&s;e who are be&s;t able to di&s;cover, will be mo&s;t ready to pardon them. They alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is: and this is a fir&s;t attempt.</P>
<P>I beg leave only to mention the rea&s;on that determined me to make choice of this &s;ubject. What plea&s;ed me par|ticularly, tho' perhaps it will not be lea&s;t liable to ob|jection with ordinary readers, was the great &s;implicity of the &s;tory. It is one, regular, and uniform, not charged with a multiplicity of incidents, and yet afford|ing &s;everal revolutions of fortune; by which the pa&s;&s;ions may be excited, varied, and driven to their full tu|mult of emotion</P>
<P>This unity of de&s;ign was always &s;ought after, and admired by the antients: and the mo&s;t eminent among the moderns, who under&s;tood their writings, have cho|&s;en to imitate them in this, from an intire conviction that the rea&s;on of it mu&s;t hold good in all ages. And here al|low me to tran&s;late a pa&s;&s;age from the celebrated <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Racine,</HI> which contains all that I have to &s;ay on this head.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">We mu&s;t not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of tho&s;e who made it. No|thing can touch us in tragedy, but what is probable. And what probability is there, that, in one Day, &s;hould happen a multitude of things, which could &s;carce happen in &s;everal Weeks? There are &s;ome wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> think that this &s;implicity is a mark of barrenne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> invention. But they do not con&s;ider, that, on the
<PB REF="5">
contrary, invention con&s;i&s;ts in making &s;omething out of nothing: and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets, who did not find in their genius either richne&s;s or force enough to engage their &s;pectators, for five acts together, by a &s;imple action, &s;upported by the violence of pa&s;&s;ions, the beauty of &s;entiments, and the noblene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion.</Q>&mdash;I would not be under&s;tood to mean that all the&s;e things are to be found in my performance: I only &s;hew the reader what I aimed at, and how I would have plea&s;ed him, had it been in my power.</P>
<P>As to the character of <HI>Sophoni&s;ba</HI>; in drawing it, I have confined my&s;elf to the truth of hi&s;tory. It were an affront to the age, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a character out of nature; e&s;pecially in a country which has produced &s;o many great examples of public &s;pirit and heroic virtues, even in the &s;ofter &s;ex: and I had de&s;troyed her character intirely, had I not marked it with that &s;trong love to her country, di&s;dain of &s;ervitude, and inborn aver&s;ion to the <HI>Romans,</HI> by which all hi&s;torians have di&s;tingui&s;hed her. Nor ought her marrying <HI>Ma&s;ini&s;&s;a,</HI> while her former hu&s;band was &s;till alive, to be reckoned a blemi&s;h in her character. For, by the laws both of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage,</HI> the captivity of the hu&s;band di&s;&s;olved the marriage of cour&s;e; as among us impotence, or adultery: not to mention the rea&s;ons of a moral and public nature, which I have put into her own mouth in the &s;cene be|twixt her and <HI>Syphax.</HI></P>
<P>This is all I have to &s;ay of the play it&s;elf. But I cannot conclude without owning my obligations to tho&s;e concerned in the repre&s;entation. They have indeed done me more than ju&s;tice. Whatever was de&s;igned as amia|ble and engaging in <HI>Ma&s;ini&s;&s;a</HI> &s;hines out in Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s action. Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> in the character of <HI>Sophoni&s;ba,</HI> has excelled what, even in the fondne&s;s of an author, I could either wi&s;h or imagine. The grace, dignity, and happy variety of her action have been univer&s;ally applaud|ed, and are truly admirable.</P>

<L>WHEN learning, after the long <HI>Gothic</HI> night,</L>
<L>Fair, o'er the we&s;tern world, renew'd his light,</L>
<L>With arts ari&s;ing <HI>Sophoni&s;ba</HI> ro&s;e:</L>
<L>The tragic mu&s;e, returning, wept her woes.</L>
<L>With her th' <HI>Italian</HI> &s;cene fir&s;t learnt to glow;</L>
<L>And the fir&s;t tears for her were taught to flow.</L>
<L>Her charms the <HI>Gallic</HI> mu&s;es next in&s;pir'd:</L>
<L><HI>Corneille</HI> him&s;elf &s;aw, wonder'd, and was fir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What foreign theatres with pride have &s;hewn,</L>
<L><HI>Britain,</HI> by ju&s;ter title, makes her own.</L>
<L>When freedom is the cau&s;e, 'tis hers to fight;</L>
<L>And hers, wken freedom is the theme, to write.</L>
<L>For this, a <HI>Briti&s;h Author</HI> bids again</L>
<L>The heroine ri&s;e, to grace the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;cene.</L>
<L>Here, as in life, &s;he breathes her genuine flame:</L>
<L>She a&s;ks what bo&s;om has not felt the &s;ame?</L>
<L>A&s;ks of the <HI>Briti&s;h Youth</HI>&mdash;Is &s;ilence there?</L>
<L>She dares to a&s;k it of the <HI>Briti&s;h Fair.</HI></L>

<L>To night, our home-&s;pun author would be true,</L>
<L>At once, to nature, hi&s;tory, and you.</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd to give our neighbours due applau&s;e,</L>
<L>He owns their learning, but di&s;dains their laws.</L>
<L>Not to his patient touch, or happy flame,</L>
<L>'Tis to his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> heart he tru&s;ts for fame.</L>
<L>If <HI>France</HI> excel him in one free-born thought,</L>
<L>The man, as well as poet, is in fault.</L>

<L>Who&s;e force alone can rai&s;e or melt the heart,</L>
<L>Thou art his guide; each pa&s;&s;ion, every line,</L>
<L>Whate'er he draws to plea&s;e, mu&s;t all be thine.</L>

And jealous <HI>Carthage</HI> driven, he with a few</L>

<L>With mountain-herbs, and on his hor&s;es fed:</L>

<LG>
<L>COME, gentle <HI>Venus!</HI> and a&s;&s;wage</L>
<L>A warring world, a bleeding age.</L>
<L>For nature lives beneath thy ray,</L>
<L>The wintry tempe&s;ts ha&s;te away,</L>
<L>A lucid calm inve&s;ts the &s;ea,</L>
<L>Thy native deep is full of thee;</L>
<L>And flowering earth, where'er you fly,</L>
<L>Is all o'er &s;pring, all &s;un the &s;ky.</L>
<L>A genial &s;pirit warms the breeze;</L>
<L>Un&s;een, among the blooming trees,</L>
<L>The feather'd lovers tune their throat,</L>

<L>Glad o'er the meads the cattle bound,</L>
<L>And love and harmony go round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But chief, into the human heart</L>
<L>You &s;trike the dear delicious dart;</L>
<L>You teach us plea&s;ing pangs to know,</L>
<L>To langui&s;h in luxurious woe,</L>
<L>To feel the generous pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Grow good by gazing, mild by &s;ighs;</L>
<L>Each happy moment to improve,</L>
<L>And fill the perfect year with love.</L>

<LG>
<L>Come, thou delight of heaven and earth!</L>
<L>To whom all creatures owe their birth;</L>
<L>Oh come, red-&s;miling! tender, come!</L>
<L>And yet prevent our final doom.</L>
<L>For long the furious god of war</L>
<L>Has cru&s;h'd us with his iron car,</L>
<L>Has rag'd along our ruin'd plains,</L>
<L>Has curs'd them with his cruel &s;tains,</L>
<L>Has clos'd our youth in endle&s;s &s;leep,</L>
<L>And made the widow'd virgin weep.</L>

Now let him feel thy wonted charms;</L>
<L>Oh take him to thy twining arms!</L>

<L>Ah then! his &s;tormy heart controul,</L>
