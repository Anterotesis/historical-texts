<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cou'd not, without do|ing Violence to my Self, forbear upon this Occa|&s;ion, to give &s;ome publick Te&s;timony of the Great and Well-grounded E&s;teem
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
I have conceiv'd for You, e|ver &s;ince I had the Honour and Happine&s;s of Your Ac|quaintance. The outward Advantages of Fortune, and the early Honours with which You are Adorn'd, to|gether with the Reputation You are known to have, among&s;t the Be&s;t and mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Men, may well imprint Veneration and E|&s;teem, on the Minds of tho&s;e who behold You from a Di&s;tance. But the&s;e are not the chief Motives, that In&s;pire me with the Re|&s;pect I bear You. A nearer Approach has given me the View of &s;omething in Your Per&s;on, infinitely beyond
<PB N="v" REF="4">
the External Ornaments of Honour and E&s;tate. I mean, an Intrin&s;ic Stock of Ver|tue and good Sen&s;e, a True Concern for Religion, and di&s;intere&s;ted Love of Your Country. Add to the&s;e an uncommon proficiency in the be&s;t, and mo&s;t u&s;eful Parts of Knowledge; toge|ther with (what in my Mind is a Perfection of the fir&s;t Rank) a &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Good|ne&s;s of Nature. All which I have Collected, not from the uncertain Reports of Fame but, from my own Ex|perience. Within the&s;e few Months, that I have the Ho|nour to be known unto You, the many delightful Hours
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
I have pa&s;s'd in Your Agree|able and Improving Con|ver&s;ation, have afforded me the opportunity of Di&s;co|vering in You many Excel|lent Qualities, which at once fill me with Admiration and E&s;teem. That one at tho&s;e Years, and in tho&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances of Wealth and Greatne&s;s, &s;hou'd continue Proof again&s;t the Charms of Luxury, and tho&s;e Cri|minal Plea&s;ures, &s;o fa&s;hion|able and predominant in the Age we live in. That He &s;hou'd pre&s;erve a &s;weet and mode&s;t Behaviour, free from that in&s;olent and a&s;&s;u|ming Air, &s;o familiar to tho&s;e who are placed above
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
the ordinary Rank of Men. That He &s;hou'd manage a great Fortune with that Pru|dence and In&s;pection, and at the &s;ame time, expend it with that Genero&s;ity and Noblene&s;s of Mind, as to &s;hew Him&s;elf equally re|mote, from a &s;ordid Par&s;i|mony, and a lavi&s;h, incon|&s;iderate Profu&s;ion of the good Things He is intru&s;ted with. This, &s;urely, were Ad|mirable and Prai&s;e worthy. But that He &s;hou'd moreo|ver by an impartial Exerci&s;e of His Rea&s;on, and con&s;tant Peru&s;al of the Sacred Scrip|tures, endeavour to attain a right Notion of the Princi|ples of Natural and Reveal|ed
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
Religion. That He &s;hou'd with the Concern of a true Pa|triot have the Intere&s;t of the Publick at Heart, and omit no means of Informing Him&s;elf what may be Prejudicial, or Advantageous to his Country, in order to prevent the one, and promote the other. In fine, that by a con&s;tant Appli|cation to the mo&s;t &s;evere and u&s;eful Studies, by a &s;trict Ob&s;ervation of the Rules of Honour and Vertue, by fre|quent and &s;erious Reflections on the mi&s;taken Mea&s;ures of the World, and the true End and Happine&s;s of Mankind, He &s;hou'd in all re&s;pects qua|lify Him&s;elf, bravely to run the Race that is &s;et before Him, to
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
de&s;erve the Character of <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> in this Life, and be ever Happy hereafter. This were amazing, and almo&s;t in|credible. Yet all this, and more than this, SIR, might I ju&s;tly &s;ay of you; did either your Mode&s;ty permit, or your Character &s;tand in Need of it. I know it might de&s;er|vedly be thought a Vanity in me, to imagine that any thing coming from &s;o ob&s;cure a Hand as mine, cou'd add a lu&s;tre to your Reputation. But I am withal &s;en&s;ible, How far I advance the Intere&s;t of my own, by laying hold on this Opportunity to make it known, that I am admitted into &s;ome degree of Intimacy, with a Per|&s;on
<PB N="x" REF="9">
of Your Exqui&s;ite Judg|ment. And with that View, I have ventur'd to make You an Addre&s;s of this Na|ture, which, the Goodne&s;s I have ever experienced in You inclines me to hope, will meet with a favour|able Reception at Your Hands. Tho' I mu&s;t own, I have Your Pardon to ask, for touching on what may, po&s;&s;ibly, be Offen&s;ive to a Vertue You are po&s;&s;e&s;t of in a very di&s;tingui&s;hing Degree. Excu&s;e me, SIR, if it was out of my Pow|er, to mention the Name of SIR JOHN PERCIVALE, without paying &s;ome Tri|bute to that Extraordina|ry

and &s;urpri&s;ing Merit, whereof I have &s;o lively and affecting an <HI>Idea,</HI> and which, I am &s;ure, cannot be expos'd in too full a light for the Imitation of Others. Of late, I have been agreeably imploy'd in con&s;idering the mo&s;t No|ble, Plea&s;ant, and Com|prehen&s;ive of all the Sen|&s;es. The fruit of that (La|bour &s;hall I call it or) Di|ver&s;ion is what I now Pre|&s;ent You with, in Hopes it may give &s;ome Entertain|ment to one who, in the mid&s;t of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Vul|gar Enjoyments, pre&s;erves a Reli&s;h for the more Refin'd

Plea&s;ures of Thought and Reflexion.

Add to this, that You are no le&s;s di&s;|pos'd to Forgive, than qua|lify'd

to di&s;cern, whatever Faults may occur in it. Nor do I think You defective in any one Point nece&s;|&s;ary to form an Exact Judg|ment on the mo&s;t ab&s;tract and difficult Things, &s;o much as in a ju&s;t Con|fidence of Your own A|bilities. And in this one In&s;tance, give me leave to &s;ay, You &s;hew a mani|fe&s;t weakne&s;s of Judgment. With Relation to the fol|lowing <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> I &s;hall only add, that I beg Your Par|don for laying a Trifle of that Nature in your Way, at a time when you are engag'd in the Impor|tant

<HEAD>I. De&s;ign.</HEAD>
<P>MY De&s;ign is to &s;hew the man|ner, wherein we perceive by Sight the Di&s;tance, Magm|tude, and Situation of <HI>Objects.</HI> Al&s;o to con&s;ider the Difference there is be|twixt the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight and Touch, and whether there be any <HI>Idea</HI> com|mon to both Sen&s;es. In treating of all which, it &s;eems to me, the Writers of <HI>Optics</HI> have proceeded on wrong Principles.</P>

<HEAD>II. Di&s;tance of it &s;elf In|vi&s;ible.</HEAD>
<P>It is, I think, agreed by all that <HI>Di|&s;tance</HI> of it &s;elf, and immediately can|not be &s;een. For <HI>Di&s;tance</HI> being a Line directed end-wi&s;e to the Eye, it projects only one Point in the Fund of the Eye. Which Point remains invaria|bly the &s;ame, whether the Di&s;tance be longer or &s;horter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. Remote Di|&s;tance per|ceiv'd ra|ther by Ex|perience, than by Sen&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>I find it al&s;o acknowledg'd, that the E&s;timate we make of the Di&s;tance of <HI>Objects</HI> con&s;iderably remote, is ra|ther an Act of Judgment grounded on <HI>Experience,</HI> than of <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI> For Exam|ple, When I perceive a great number of intermediate <HI>Objects,</HI> &s;uch as Hou&s;es, Fields, Rivers, and the like, which I have experienced to take up a con&s;i|derable Space; I thence form a Judg|ment or Conclu&s;ion, that the <HI>Object</HI> I &s;ee beyond them is at a great Di&s;tance. Again, when an <HI>Object</HI> appears Faint and Small, which at a near Di&s;tance I have experienced to make a vigorous and large Appearance; I in&s;tantly con|clude it to be far off. And this, 'tis
<PB N="3" REF="26">
evident, is the re&s;ult of <HI>Experience</HI>; without which, from the Faintne&s;s and Littlene&s;s, I &s;hould not have in|fer'd any thing concerning the Di|&s;tance of <HI>Objects.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. Near Di|&s;tance thought to be percei|ved by the <HI>Angle</HI> of the <HI>Optic Axes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But when an <HI>Object</HI> is placed at &s;o near a Di&s;tance, as that the Interval between the Eyes bears any &s;en&s;ible Proportion to it. It is the receiv'd Opinion that the two <HI>Optic Axes</HI> (the Fancy that we &s;ee only with one Eye at once being exploded) concurring at the <HI>Object</HI> do there make an <HI>Angle,</HI> by means of which, according as it is Greater or Le&s;&s;er, the <HI>Object</HI> is per|ceiv'd to be nearer or farther off.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>V. Difference between this and the former manner of perceiving Di&s;tance.</HEAD>
<P>Betwixt which, and the foregoing manner of E&s;timating Di&s;tance, there is this remarkable Difference. That whereas, there was no apparent, ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connexion between &s;mall Di|&s;tance and a large and &s;trong Ap|pearance, or between great Di&s;tance, and a little and faint Appearance. Yet there appears a very nece&s;&s;ary Con|nexion
<PB N="4" REF="27">
between an obtu&s;e Angle and near Di&s;tance, and an acute Angle and farther Di&s;tance. It does not in the lea&s;t depend upon Experience, but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienc'd it, that the nearer the Concurrence of the <HI>Optic Axes,</HI> the greater the <HI>Angle,</HI> and the remoter their Concurrence is, the le&s;&s;er will be the <HI>Angle</HI> comprehended by them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VI. Al&s;o by Di|verging Rays.</HEAD>
<P>There is another way, mention'd by the <HI>Optic Writers,</HI> whereby they will have us judge of tho&s;e Di&s;tan|ces, in re&s;pect of which, the breadth of the <HI>Pupil</HI> hath any &s;en&s;ible bigne&s;s. And that is the greater or le&s;&s;er Di|vergency of the Rays, which i&s;&s;uing from the vi&s;ible Point, do fall on the <HI>Pupil:</HI> That Point being judged near|e&s;t, which is &s;een by mo&s;t diverging Rays; and that remoter, which is &s;een by le&s;s diverging Rays. And &s;o on, the apparent Di&s;tance &s;till increa&s;ing, as the Divergency of the Rays decrea&s;es, till at length it becomes infinite, when the Rays that fall on the <HI>Pupil</HI> are to
<PB N="5" REF="28">
Sen&s;e Parallel. And after this manner it is &s;aid we perceive Di&s;tances when we look only with one Eye.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VII. This de|pends not on Experi|ence.</HEAD>
<P>In this Ca&s;e al&s;o, 'tis plain we are not beholding to Experience: It be|ing a certain, nece&s;&s;ary Truth, that the nearer the direct Rays falling on the Eye approach to a <HI>Paralleli&s;m,</HI> the farther off is the Point of their In|ter&s;ection, or the vi&s;ible Point from whence they flow.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VIII. The&s;e the common Accounts, but not &s;a|tisfactory.</HEAD>
<P>I have here &s;et down the common, current Accounts that are given of our perceiving near Di&s;tances by Sight, which, tho' they are unque&s;tionably receiv'd for true by <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> and accordingly made u&s;e of by them in determining the apparent Places of <HI>Objects,</HI> do neverthele&s;s &s;eem to me very un&s;atisfactory: And that for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IX. Some <HI>Ideas</HI> perceived by the me|diation of others.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is evident that when the Mind perceives any <HI>Idea,</HI> not imme|diately and of it &s;elf, it mu&s;t be by
<PB N="6" REF="29">
the means of &s;ome other <HI>Idea.</HI> Thus, for In&s;tance, the Pa&s;&s;ions which are in the Mind of another, are of them|&s;elves, to me invi&s;ible. I may never|thele&s;s perceive them by Sight, tho' not immediately yet, by means of the Colours they produce in the Counte|nance. We do often &s;ee Shame or Fear in the Looks of a Man, by per|ceiving the Changes of his Counte|nance to Red or Pale.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>X. No <HI>Idea</HI> which is not it &s;elf per|ceived, can be the means of perceiving another.</HEAD>
<P>Moreover it is evident, that no <HI>I|dea</HI> which is not it &s;elf perceiv'd, can be to me the means of perceiving any other <HI>Idea.</HI> If I do not perceive the Redne&s;s or Palene&s;s of a Man's Face them&s;elves, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hou'd perceive by them the Pa&s;&s;ions which are in his Mind.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XI. Di&s;tance perceived by means of &s;ome other <HI>Idea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Now from <HI>Sect.</HI> II. 'Tis plain that Di|&s;tance is in it's own nature impercei|vable, and yet it is perceiv'd by Sight. It remains therefore, that it be brought into view by means of &s;ome other <HI>Idea,</HI> that is it &s;elf immediately per|ceiv'd in the Act of <HI>Vi&s;ion.</HI></P>

<HEAD>XII. Tho&s;e Lines and Angles mentioned in <HI>Optics,</HI> are not them&s;elves perceiv'd.</HEAD>
<P>But tho&s;e <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Angles,</HI> by means whereof <HI>Mathematicians</HI> pretend to explain the Perception of Di&s;tance, are them&s;elves not at all perceiv'd, nor are they in Truth, ever thought of by tho&s;e unskilful in <HI>Optics.</HI> I appeal to any ones Experience, whether up|on Sight of an <HI>Object,</HI> he compute it's Di&s;tance by the bigne&s;s of the <HI>An|gle,</HI> made by the meeting of the two <HI>Optic Axes?</HI> Or whether he ever think of the greater or le&s;&s;er Divergency of the Rays, which arrive from any Point to his <HI>Pupil.</HI> Nay, whether it be not perfectly impo&s;&s;ible for him to per|ceive by Sen&s;e, the various Angles wherewith the Rays according to their greater, or le&s;&s;er Divergence do fall on his Eye.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<PB N="8" REF="31">
<HEAD>XIII, Hence the Mind doth not perceive Di&s;tance by Lines and Angles</HEAD>
<P>Since therefore tho&s;e <HI>Angles</HI> and <HI>Lines</HI> are not them&s;elves perceiv'd by Sight, it follows from <HI>Sect.</HI> X. that the Mind does not by them judge of the Di&s;tance of <HI>Objects.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Third</HI> and La&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall give for my Rejecting that Doctrine, is, that tho' we &s;hould grant the real Exi&s;tence of tho&s;e <HI>Optic Angles,</HI> &amp;c. and that it was po&s;&s;ible for the Mind to perceive them; yet the&s;e Princi|ples wou'd not be found &s;ufficient to explain the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of <HI>Di&s;tance.</HI> As &s;hall be &s;hewn hereafter.</P>

<P>Now, It being already &s;hewn that Di&s;tance is &s;ugge&s;ted to the Mind, by the Mediation of &s;ome other <HI>Idea</HI> which is it &s;elf perceiv'd in the Act of Seeing. It remains that we enquire what <HI>Idea,</HI> or <HI>Sen&s;ations</HI> there be that attend <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> unto which we may &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Di&s;tance are connected, and by which they are introduced into the Mind. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is certain by Experience, that when we look at a near <HI>Object</HI> with both Eyes, according as it approaches, or recedes from us, we alter the Di&s;po|&s;ition of our Eyes, by le&s;&s;ening or widening the Interval between the <HI>Pupils.</HI> This Di&s;po&s;ition or Turn of the Eyes is attended with a Sen|&s;ation, which &s;eems to me, to be that which in this Ca&s;e brings the <HI>Idea</HI> of greater, or le&s;&s;er Di&s;tance into the Mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XVII. Betwixt which and Di&s;tance there is no nece&s;&s;ary Connexion.</HEAD>
<P>Not, that their is any natural or nece&s;&s;ary Connexion between the
<PB N="10" REF="33">
Sen&s;ation we perceive by the Turn of the Eyes, and greater or le&s;&s;er Di&s;tance. But becau&s;e the Mind has by con&s;tant <HI>Experience,</HI> found the dif|ferent Sen&s;ations corre&s;ponding to the different Di&s;po&s;itions of the Eyes, to be attended each, with a Different Degree of Di&s;tance in the <HI>Object:</HI> There has grown an Habitual or Cu|&s;tomary Connexion, between tho&s;e two &s;orts of <HI>Ideas.</HI> So that the Mind no &s;ooner perceives the Sen&s;ation a|ri&s;ing from the different Turn it gives the Eyes, in order to bring the <HI>Pu|pils</HI> nearer, or farther a&s;under; but it withal perceives the different <HI>Idea</HI> of Di&s;tance which was wont to be connected with that Sen&s;ation. Ju&s;t as upon hearing a certain Sound, the <HI>Idea</HI> is immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to the Under&s;tanding, which Cu&s;tom had united with it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XVIII. Scarce room for Mi&s;take in this mat|ter.</HEAD>
<P>Nor do I &s;ee, how I can ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken in this Matter. I know evidently that Di&s;tance is not per|ceived
<PB N="11" REF="34">
of it &s;elf. That by con&s;equence, it mu&s;t be perceived by means of &s;ome other <HI>Idea</HI> which is immediate|ly perceiv'd, and varies with the dif|ferent Degrees of Di&s;tance. I know al&s;o that the Sen&s;ation ari&s;ing from the Turn of the Eyes is of it &s;elf, im|mediately perceiv'd, and various De|grees thereof are connected with dif|ferent Di&s;tances; which never fail to accompany them into my Mind, when I view an <HI>Object</HI> di&s;tinctly with both Eyes, who&s;e Di&s;tance is &s;o &s;mall that in re&s;pect of it, the Interval between the Eyes has any con&s;iderable Mag|nitude.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XIX. No regard had to the Angle of the <HI>Optic Axes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I know it is a receiv'd Opinion, that by altering the di&s;po&s;ition of the Eyes, the Mind perceives whether the Angle of the <HI>Optic Axes</HI> is made greater or le&s;&s;er. And that accord|ingly by a kind of <HI>Natural Geometry,</HI> it judges the Point of their Inter&s;ecti|on to be nearer, or farther off. But that this is not true, I am convinc'd
<PB N="12" REF="35">
by my own Experience. Since I am not con&s;cious, that I make any &s;uch u&s;e of the Perception I have by the Turn of my Eyes. And for me to make tho&s;e Judgments, and draw tho&s;e Conclu&s;ions from it, without knowing that I do &s;o, &s;eems altogether incomprehen|&s;ible.</P>

<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XX. Judgment of Di&s;tance made with both Eyes, the Re&s;ult of <HI>Experi|ence.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From all which it plainly fol|lows, that the Judgment we make of the Di&s;tance of an <HI>Object,</HI> view'd with both Eyes, is entirely the <HI>Re|&s;ult of Experience.</HI> If we had not con&s;tantly found certain Sen&s;ations ari&s;ing from the various Di&s;po&s;iti|on of the Eyes, attended with cer|tain degrees of Di&s;tance.

And the nearer it is brought, the more confu&s;ed Appearance it makes. And this being found con|&s;tantly to be &s;o, there ari&s;es in the Mind an <HI>Habitual</HI> Connexion be|tween the &s;everal Degrees of Confu|&s;ion and Di&s;tance.

Man, I believe, will pretend to &s;ee or feel tho&s;e imaginary Angles, that the Rays are &s;uppo&s;ed to form accor|ding to their various Inclinations on his Eye.

<P>What &s;eems to have mi&s;led the Writers of <HI>Optics</HI> in this Matter is, that they imagine Men judge of Di|&s;tance, as they do of a Conclu&s;ion in <HI>Mathematics</HI>; betwixt which and the Premi&s;es, it is indeed ab&s;olute|ly requi&s;ite there be an apparent, nece&s;&s;ary Connexion.

Having of a long time, expe|rienced certain <HI>Ideas,</HI> perceivable by Touch, as Di&s;tance, Tangible Figure, and Solidity to have been con|nected with certain <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, I do upon perceiving the&s;e <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, forthwith conclude what Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> are, by the won|ted, ordinary cour&s;e of Nature like to follow.

This I am per&s;waded of, as to what concerns my &s;elf. And I believe whoever will look narrowly into his own Thoughts, and examin what he means by &s;aying, he &s;ees this, or that thing at a Di&s;tance, will agree with me that, what he &s;ees only &s;ugge&s;ts to his Under|&s;tanding, that after having pa&s;&s;ed a certain Di&s;tance, to be mea&s;ur'd by the Motion of his Body, which is perceivable by Touch, he &s;hall come to perceive &s;uch, and &s;uch Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> which have been u&s;ually connected with &s;uch and &s;uch Vi&s;ible <HI>Ideas.</HI> But that one might be deceived by the&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions of Sen&s;e, and that there is no nece&s;&s;ary Connexion, between Vi&s;ible, and Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted by them, we need go no farther than the next Looking-Gla&s;s or Pi|cture,

And ob&s;erve what tho&s;e things be, which in|troduce the <HI>Ideas</HI> of <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>le&s;|&s;er</HI> into my Thoughts, when I look on any <HI>Object.</HI> And the&s;e I find to be, Fir&s;t, the Magnitude or Ex|ten&s;ion of the Vi&s;ible <HI>Object,</HI> which being immediately perceived by Sight, is connected with that other which is Tangible, and placed at a Di&s;tance. Secondly, The Confu|&s;ion or Di&s;tinctne&s;s. And, Thirdly, The Vigorou&s;ne&s;s or Faintne&s;s of the afore&s;aid Vi&s;ible Appearance. <HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> by how much the greater or le&s;|&s;er, do I conclude the Tangible <HI>Object</HI> to be. But, be the <HI>Idea</HI> im|mediately perceived by Sight never &s;o large, yet if it be withal Con|fu&s;ed,
<PB N="62" REF="85">
I judge the Magnitude of the thing to be but &s;mall. If it be Di&s;tinct and Clear, I judge it greater. And if it be Faint, I ap|prehend it to be yet greater. What is here meant, by Confu&s;ion and Faintne&s;s, has been Explain'd in <HI>Sect.</HI> XXXV.</P>

&s;traight Line <HI>C c</HI> from the lower End of the <HI>Object</HI>; and the Stroak or Impul&s;e on <HI>a,</HI> as coming in the Line <HI>Aa</HI> from the upper End of the <HI>Object,</HI> is directed to make a right Judgement of the Situa|tion of the <HI>Object ABC,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding the Picture of it be in|verted. Moreover, this is illu&s;tra|ted by conceiving a Blind Man, who holding in his Hands two Sticks that cro&s;s each other, doth with them touch the extremities of an <HI>Object,</HI> placed in a perpen|dicular Situation. It is certain, this Man will judge that to be the upper part of the <HI>Object,</HI> which he touches with the Stick held in the undermo&s;t Hand, and that to be the lower part of the <HI>Ob|ject,</HI> which he touches with the Stick in his uppermo&s;t Hand.

<P>Farther, What greatly contributes to make us mi&s;take in this Mat|ter is, that when we think of the Pictures in the Fund of the Eye, we imagine our &s;elves looking on the Fund of another's Eye, or a|nother looking on the Fund of our own Eye, and beholding the Pictures Painted thereon.
