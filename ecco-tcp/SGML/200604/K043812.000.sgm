<HEAD>A
LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are many undeni|able
and irrefragable argu|ments
to &s;upport my nega|tive;
but, as <HI>Vellum</HI> &s;ays, Out of &s;e|veral,
I &s;hall only mention a few.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="5">
I need not, in this ca&s;e, beg a
que&s;tion, which will readily be granted,
and therefore I &s;hall take it for granted,
that all per&s;ons, who go to the thea|tre,
go there for Entertainment, in
order to hear and &s;ee every thing and
every body. If I read Mr. <HI>Palmer's</HI>
name in the bill of the <HI>way of the
world</HI> for <HI>Mirabel,</HI> I go with a con|viction
that I &s;hall &s;ee and hear him
with entire &s;atisfaction, and &s;o of Mr.
<HI>King,</HI> in the part of <HI>Atall,</HI> in the <HI>Dou|ble
Gallant</HI>; now in neither of the&s;e
plays, nor in many others does Mr.
<HI>Garrick</HI> intrude upon my entertain|ment,
nor ob&s;truct my &s;atisfaction,
becau&s;e he does not play in them:
But when I go to &s;ee the <HI>Su&s;picious
Husband,</HI> there I &s;ee Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> in
the part of <HI>Ranger</HI>; and &s;ure no man
will deny, but that he plays that part,
<PB N="11" REF="6">
better than any other man in the world;
But will any per&s;on be &s;o hardy as
to tell me, I &s;hall part with my money,
to &s;ee <HI>hone&s;t Ranger</HI> only; I want to
&s;ee <HI>Frankly</HI> and <HI>Bellamy</HI> and ratling
<HI>Jack Meggot</HI>; I would willingly &s;ee
Mr. <HI>Strictland</HI>; the character, who gives
title to the Comedy, yet am I herein
debarred, by Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s in&s;tru&s;ion,
for when he appears on the &s;tage, I
am &s;o blinded, either by prejudice or
admiration, that I can &s;ee no body
el&s;e; I can hear no body el&s;e; I can
bear no body el&s;e; for in&s;tance, the
other day, I wanted to hear <HI>Jacky
Meggot</HI> invite <HI>Ranger</HI> and his friend
in the <HI>Italian</HI> ta&s;te, to his hou&s;e, but
I never heard a &s;yllable of it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Ranger</HI> is with his two friends,
<HI>Bellamy</HI> and <HI>Frankly,</HI> I hear him indeed
<PB N="12" REF="7">
&s;peak of them, and I am as much &s;ur|pized
to find him &s;peaking <HI>to</HI> them,
but I can never &s;et my eyes on them,
while he is by: Before he came in,
I could &s;ee and hear them, as di&s;|tinctly,
and as clearly, as vi&s;ibly and
audibly as ever I &s;aw or heard any thing
in all my life, but when he comes in,
whether it is, that he clouds my eyes,
or fills my &s;ight, I cannot for my &s;oul de|termine,
but I &s;ee no more of <HI>Bellamy</HI>
and <HI>Frankly.</HI> If they <HI>are</HI> there, I
do not hear them, and though I u&s;e
my gla&s;s I cannot &s;ee them, till he goes
out again.</P>
<P>I hear him &s;ay (plain enough)
<HI>Now it is, dear boy, and hone&s;t Ranger,</HI>
and <HI>ju&s;t now you would have cut my
throat</HI>; but I never heard that they &s;aid
any &s;uch words, but from his report,
<PB N="13" REF="8">
I &s;u&s;pected my own hearing, nor I
would not believe my own eyes, till
I a&s;ked a gentleman who &s;at by me,
whether <HI>Frankly</HI> or <HI>Bellamy</HI> were on
the Stage, and he &s;aid that he could
not &s;ee any &s;uch per&s;ons.&mdash;Then,
&s;aid I, who the devil is he &s;peaking to?&mdash;By my &s;oul, replied the gen|tleman,
I can't tell, for I &s;ee neither
of them, nor do I believe either of
them to be on the &s;tage: if they are, it
is more than I can &s;ay, and I am as
unea&s;y as you can be to &s;ee one man
play the whole comedy by him&s;elf;
it is really too hard upon him, and I
can't find the rea&s;on why he keeps &s;o
many people in &s;allary to &s;o little pur|po&s;e,
and almo&s;t for doing nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="9">
I came here the other night, when
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> did not play, and I &s;aw
every body, and heard every thing to
my entire &s;atisfaction; but when this
confounded <HI>Garrick</HI> comes on the
&s;tage, he confounds my eyes and ears
in &s;uch a manner, that I am de|prived
of both organs, which are en|tirely
engro&s;&s;ed by his appearance and
voice.</P>
<P>When my &s;ide's-man had done &s;peak|ing,
I a&s;ked a lady, who &s;at by me,
Who Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> was &s;peaking to? She
&s;aid, She could not tell.&mdash;When he
&s;ays, <HI>any letters,</HI> or <HI>me&s;&s;age?</HI> does he
&s;peak to the &s;cene? for by the lord, I
&s;ee no &s;ervant! She &s;aid, She thought
her eyes pretty good, and that &s;he was
as blind as my&s;elf in that re&s;pect&mdash;and indeed &s;he had the highe&s;t pair of
<PB N="15" REF="10">
eyes that ever my eyes beheld; yet clear
as her vi&s;ion was, &s;he could &s;ee no &s;er|vant,
nor any thing el&s;e, but this in|dividual,
<HI>Garrick</HI>&mdash;He is not of &s;o
gigantic a &s;tature, nor do I think he
ever will exceed &s;ix feet in height; he
is not &s;o fat as Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff,</HI> and
how the devil, does this manager ma|nage
to cover every body and every
thing from our &s;ight.&mdash;He mu&s;t
deal in magic, thus to interpo&s;e between
the &s;pectators and every body el&s;e, in &s;uch
a <HI>black art</HI> manner, as render them invi|&s;ible.</P>
<P>He is the rever&s;e of a dark-lanthorn
which hides the bearer, and throws light
upon every body el&s;e; he is like the
focus of a gla&s;s, which attracts all the
rays of light; he is like a &s;un-dial, which
interprets time by light and &s;hade&mdash;him|&s;elf
<PB N="16" REF="11">
all <HI>light,</HI> every body el&s;e all
<HI>&s;hade.</HI></P>
<P>Now a repre&s;entation may be called a
picture, but no good picture was ever
all light, and all &s;hade, but both &s;hould
be happily compounded and mixed to
make a picture agreeable and &s;triking.</P>
<P>I, like a fool, the other night, went
to &s;ee the <HI>Alchymi&s;t:</HI> I &s;aw <HI>Burton</HI> and
<HI>Palmer</HI> plain enough, till <HI>Abel Drugger</HI>
came on, fiddling with his &s;hop-keeper's
apron. He no &s;ooner came on than
away went <HI>Subtle,</HI> and captain <HI>Face</HI>:
&s;ays I, to one near me, is not this mon|&s;trous,
that <HI>Subtle</HI> and <HI>Face</HI> &s;hould go off
the &s;tage, at the time when <HI>Nab</HI> wants
them He an&s;wered, that he thought
it unaccountable, and that he was &s;erved
&s;o once before the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on; and that
if he had recollected him&s;elf in that par|ticular,
<PB N="17" REF="12">
he would not have come to &s;ee
<HI>Abel Drugger</HI> alone.</P>
<P>You know the plot, &s;ays he, is mixt,
and has a variety of per&s;ons in the drama,
but the devil a one per&s;on here, but
<HI>Abel Drugger.</HI>&mdash;You &s;hall &s;ee him fight
a parcel of <HI>Shadows,</HI> and beat them off
pre&s;ently: He is excellent at <HI>Skiomachy.</HI>
He did &s;o, in a very &s;hort time, beating
the air, with as much dexterity, as if
there had been a dozen people on the
&s;tage: Well, &s;aid I, to the gentleman
near me, I don't like this egoti&s;m, for as
<HI>Young</HI> the &s;atyri&s;t expre&s;&s;es it,<Q><HI>and I's</HI> the little hero of each tale.</Q></P>
<P>Another cogent rea&s;on, I &s;hall offer to
the public, and you, &s;ir, why Mr. <HI>Gar|tick</HI>
&s;hould <HI>not</HI> appear on the &s;tage is
<PB N="18" REF="13">
that be&s;ides blind-folding people, by his
fa&s;cination, he impo&s;es upon our hearing,
rendering us deaf to every other per&s;on,
but him&s;elf.&mdash;This is an intolerable <HI>mono|pily,</HI>
thus to &s;eize upon, and captivate our
two &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I have &s;poken to that of &s;ight already,
and now I &s;hall enter upon that of
hearing.</P>
<P>We have had occular proofs &s;ufficient
to convince all rea&s;onable people, that is,
all people that will believe their eyes,
that Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> &s;hould not appear upon
the &s;tage. Had he happened to be an
actor in <HI>Paris,</HI> he would long &s;ince, have
been put into the Ba&s;tile, but as he lives
under &s;o mild a government as that of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI>; the be&s;t we can do, is to
put him under the puni&s;hment of pro|&s;cription,
<PB N="19" REF="14">
or in other words to bani&s;h
him the &s;tage, the &s;cene of his delinquency,
nor is it indeed rea&s;onable in the nature
of things to permit him to reign any
longer in &s;o unlimited a tyranny, a ty|ranny
for which &s;ome men, would long
&s;ince have been brought to the &s;caf|fold.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t wonder, why his own com|pany
have not entered into a formal pro|&s;ecution
again&s;t him, and brought their
<HI>habeas corpus,</HI> for rendering them invi|&s;ible
and inaudible: they permit their
names to be printed, which is a kind
of bond, or promi&s;&s;ary note, payable to
the public, that they will enact &s;uch,
and &s;uch characters; now if Mr. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>
or Mr. <HI>Burton,</HI> or any of the players,
engages thus in print to perform this or
that part, and does not appear, when
<PB N="20" REF="15">
<HI>Garrick</HI> comes on, have not I my writ
of in&s;olvency again&s;t him; what can they
plead why I &s;hould not oblige them to
appear, when Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> comes on.&mdash;Why do they go off that in&s;tant.&mdash;There's no body in the galleries, find
any fault with them; they, and every
other actor or actre&s;s in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> have
their peculiar merits in their own particu|lar
ca&s;t. Each has his proper walk, and
&s;hines in his own department; and the
next time I &s;ee them di&s;appear on <HI>Gar|rick's</HI>
entering, I &s;hall &s;ay with the witches
in <HI>Macbeth, appear, appear.</HI> So I give
them this fair warning.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> &s;ays in <HI>Hamlet</HI>&mdash;<HI>I am too much in the Sun</HI>; he &s;peaks an
evident truth, and if I may be allowed
the Expre&s;&s;ion, a <HI>palpable</HI> one. It is
downright demon&s;tration.&mdash;He is
<PB N="21" REF="16">
<HI>too much in the &s;un</HI>; what he &s;ays needs
no illu&s;tration, for he is <HI>&s;o much in the
&s;un,</HI> that he takes all the light to him|&s;elf,
and like a ray of glory, or an <HI>infula</HI>
of beams, eclip&s;es all others.</P>
<P>The moon her&s;elf, and mo&s;t of the
&s;tars, who borrow their light from the
&s;un, have not &s;o much rea&s;on to com|plain:
If they have not light of their
own, they &s;hine in borrowed robes, but
they would take it very ill of <HI>Dan Phoe|bus,</HI>
<HI>that wandering knight &s;o fair,</HI> if he
&s;hould, like <HI>Garrick,</HI> get up of a fro&s;ty
night, put on his dama&s;k night-gown,
and then put them all out.&mdash;It would
be as cruel in the <HI>&s;un</HI> to do &s;o, as it is
in <HI>Othello,</HI> when he <HI>puts out the light,
and then puts out the light.</HI> And I
think, with deference to the judgment
of the public, that it is as in&s;uffera|ble
in Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> to extingui&s;h all
<PB N="22" REF="17">
other lights but his own: and I hope
they will take proper cognizance, and
jointly agree to put him out by the con|curring
votes of o&s;traci&s;m.</P>
<P>I will only a&s;k the company of <HI>Drury|lane</HI>-hou&s;e,
has the manager, (as <HI>Pytha|goras</HI>
did of old to his di&s;ciples) enjoin
them &s;ilence for any term of years. If
he has done this in his wi&s;dom, 'tis but
rea&s;onable, he &s;hould &s;et them an exam|ple.&mdash;He &s;hould, like a good father,
enforce by his <HI>precedent,</HI> what he preaches
in doctrine, and not like an incendiary, <HI>&s;et
us all by the ears</HI>; and like the &s;entence
of perjury, impo&s;e the <HI>pillory</HI> upon his
audience. I mu&s;t own, that I am &s;o
great a lover of mu&s;ic, that I could &s;it
a whole hour to hear a good <HI>&s;olo</HI>
performed by a good hand, but by the
blood of the <HI>Mirables,</HI> I do not &s;ee
why Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> &s;hould every night for
<PB N="23" REF="18">
the&s;e many &s;ea&s;ons, play nothing but <HI>&s;olos.</HI>
This is rehear&s;al upon rehear&s;al, and repeti|tion
upon the back of repetition. Are we
never to have a concert, becau&s;e truly
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> loves nothing but <HI>&s;olos.</HI> I
think Mr. <HI>Holland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Bransby,</HI> and indeed every Mr. and
Mrs. in the hou&s;e have a ju&s;t title to per|form
their particular parts in the theatri|cal
concert.</P>
<P>They are paid for doing &s;o; we
the public pay them, and we in&s;i&s;t
on their playing for the future, or we
will pay them, and repay them.&mdash;Had
we found fault with their perform|ance
at any one time, had we con|demned
their theatrical merit, whether
natural or acquired, if we had refu&s;ed
to give them, what is their undoubted
right, our ju&s;t applau&s;e, they might offer
<PB N="24" REF="19">
&s;ome plea, for not di&s;charging their duty,
but as matters &s;tand, we think this time
as &s;ea&s;onable as well as un&s;ea&s;onable;
&s;ilence is in&s;en&s;ible, and we hope to
&s;ee a reformation in due time, which yet
we think cannot well be made, except
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> begins it by a &s;olemn de|parture
from the &s;tage, &s;ince we may ap|ply
<HI>Horace</HI>'s &s;aying to him,<Q><L>Lu&s;i&s;ti Satis&mdash;</L>
<L>Tempus abire tibi.</L></Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall now &s;tate &s;ome matters
of fact, in order to &s;upport our argu|ments.</P>
<P>One matter of fact is, that when he
played <HI>Hamlet,</HI> no body el&s;e appeared,
when he was on. Our attention was
&s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by <HI>Hamlet,</HI> that
<PB N="25" REF="20">
we took no notice of any other per|&s;on;
I neither &s;aw <HI>Bernardo</HI> nor <HI>Mar|cellus,</HI>
nor heard one &s;yllable of either
<HI>Ro&s;enerans</HI> or <HI>Guilder&s;tern,</HI> while <HI>Ham|let</HI>
was on.&mdash;When <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>&mdash;The play's the thing.</Q>
With which I'll catch the con&s;cience of
the thing we expected; there would
have been a play, but if there was any
&s;uch thing, I did not &s;ee it or hear
it; it might have been play'd for any
thing I know, but certain it is, it e&s;|caped
me. Po&s;&s;ibly, I was gazing too
attentively on <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;itting at the feet
of <HI>Ophelia,</HI> and looking at &s;omething
through her fan.&mdash;I knew that the
object of his intuition was to have been
the <HI>King,</HI> but the devil a king was there,
or if there was it, was a king of Ham|let's
<PB N="26" REF="21">
own making; like that, when
he &s;ays,
<Q><HI>A</HI> King of &s;hreds and patches.</Q>As in like manner, in the <HI>Alchymi&s;t,</HI> is
it fitting, that <HI>Abel Dugger,</HI> &s;hould play
the whole play him&s;elf, and let no one
el&s;e be &s;een or heard, while he's on?
If monopoly in trade be an injury to
the public, then it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,
with re&s;pect to our entertainments, a
theatrical monopoly, is an unfair mono|poly,
an embargo on our ta&s;te, a kind
of an inqui&s;ition, a very &s;tar-chamber on
our under&s;tanding; and if trade in ge|neral
&s;uffers by &s;uch monopolies, &s;o is
ta&s;te in general utterly depraved by &s;uch
unju&s;t engro&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="22">
Why &s;hould not the witches be &s;een
or heard, when <HI>Macbeth</HI> comes in, when
he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Ye black confederate midnight hags,</L>
<L>What are ye doing?</L></Q>
In&s;tead of an&s;wering him, <HI>a deed, &amp;c.</HI> as
they &s;hould do, they in&s;tantly di&s;appear,
they vani&s;h, and are no more &s;een; he
bewitches the very witches, rendering
them, and all their diabolical proceed|ings
invi&s;ible.&mdash;The cauldron is no
more, he extingui&s;hes their infernal flames,
and plays hell with hell it&s;elf, &s;ending
the very devil, as the &s;entence does the
condemned criminal, to the place from
whence he came.&mdash;And is this &s;ufferable?
Will any man be &s;o hardy as to &s;ay, this
is to be borne,&mdash;it is not to be borne,&mdash;
<PB N="28" REF="23">
I think the witches have as great a right
to an&s;wer, as <HI>Macbeth</HI> to a&s;k a que&s;tion;
at lea&s;t, I think it is &s;o in your hou&s;e,
&s;ir; and what is &s;auce for the goo&s;e,
&s;hould be &s;au&s;e for the gander, as the
&s;aying is; now at your hou&s;e, there are
no &s;uch proceedings, no &s;uch indecorum.
He does not &s;wallow up the witches,
and devour them at a mouthful. He
does not like the famous <HI>fire-eater,</HI> feed
upon brim&s;tone and other combu&s;tibles,
which reminds me of a &s;tory I have
&s;omewhere read, applicable to Mr. <HI>Gar|rick</HI>'s
thus eating up the <HI>devil</HI> without
a grain of &s;alt: I &s;ay, applicable to him
for one very good rea&s;on, and that is, if
I do not in&s;ert it here, I &s;hall forget to
in&s;ert it any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="24">
A certain nobleman to divert him&s;elf,
carried a young Blackamoor ju&s;t imported
to one of the Papi&s;h chapels in the
city, and when the prie&s;t was eating the
wafer, the blackamoor asked his ma&s;ter,
What that man was eating? Who an|&s;wered,
that he was eating his God.&mdash;I wi&s;h we had him in our country,
&s;ays the blackamoor, for he would eat
the devil purely.</P>
<P>This &s;tory needs no comment, and
therefore we &s;hall make none; we hope
therefore from what we have advanced
that the&s;e irrefragable arguments will
have &s;ome weight with Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI>
and you are at liberty to &s;hew this let|ter
to him: if he is able to an&s;wer all,
or any one of them, to our &s;atisfaction,
we &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive acknow|ledgment
<PB N="30" REF="25">
of our fault in the daily ad|verti&s;er,
with the hopes of forgivene&s;s
and promi&s;e that we &s;hall never be
again guilty in this particular, if not, we
&s;hall &s;ay as the King in the Mourning
bride expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>Take away his face</Q>For we mu&s;t acknowledge that it daz|zles
our &s;ight, in &s;uch a manner, that
we can &s;ee nothing el&s;e. Nor indeed is
any thing herein written, &s;ir, in the lea&s;t
to in&s;inuate any thing to the prejudice of
your hou&s;e, which we honour and re|&s;pect
as we &s;hould do, and we &s;hould
want ta&s;te did we &s;ay any other. Your
performers have merit enough to extort
prai&s;e from the be&s;t judges or the nice&s;t
criticks, and perhaps one of the be&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="26">
low comedians in the world is in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is any thing herein written
intended to depreciate or run down the
Actors of <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> but the rever&s;e is
the intention of this letter; for if we
were hardy enough to &s;ay, that all and
every of them has not theatrical merit in
an eminent degree, it were to give our
own judgments the lie, and the fal&s;e|hood,
like du&s;t thrown in the wind,
would fly in our faces&mdash;it were a &s;hal|low
artifice, becau&s;e we run down this
mo&s;t <HI>unrea&s;onable man,</HI> thereby to traduce
or le&s;&s;en that good e&s;teem, which they
have learned by their good quallities,
or becau&s;e they are not &s;een, or heard
when Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> appears, that therefore
they are not <HI>fit to be &s;een, or that they
&s;hould not be.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="27">
The rever&s;e of all this is meant and
intended by the whole tenour, of
which however tortured to confe&s;s, will
never be made to confe&s;s what it never
intended; I &s;ay, it is fitting they &s;hould be
&s;een or heard, and that in order thereto, we
have given this our &s;afe advice to <HI>David
Garrick</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>
play-hou&s;e, that he will appear no
more on the &s;tage, which advice we
&s;hould not have given in &s;o peremptory
a manner if he did not eclip&s;e tho&s;e
who play with him. Our advice is
candid, free, and di&s;intere&s;ted, &s;ince
it will be allowed, that as there cannot
be two &s;uns, neither can there be two
<HI>Garricks,</HI> &s;ince he like his own <HI>Richard,</HI>
<HI>has no brother,</HI> is <HI>like no brother.</HI><Q><PB N="33" REF="28">He is him&s;elf alone.</Q></P>
<P>If then no &s;imilarity appears, no cor|re&s;ponding
features are &s;een, upon a
compari&s;on, that &s;uperiority of light
which, we allow him, (and which if
we did not allow him, the world would
do it for us) has rai&s;ed him to an emi|nence
above all in the theatrical walk;
and, as a witty orange-woman &s;aid to
a gentleman, who asked, Where was
his Fellow (meaning his &s;ervant) By
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &s;ir, not in Chri&s;tendom; &s;o we
may &s;ay of <HI>Garrick</HI>&mdash;not in the uni|ver&s;e;
and for this one material, migh|ty,
and &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on, we exclude
him from the &s;tage, that other people
may have their turn to &s;hine; for if we
did with him, as <HI>Juliet</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Romeo,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="29">
Take him, and cut him out in little
&s;tars, and he will make the face of
heaven &s;o fine, that all the world would
be in love with night, and pay no wor|&s;hip
to the garni&s;h &s;un.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> would po&s;&s;ibly glitter
every atom and particle of him; and
like a looking - gla&s;s, broke into ten
thou&s;and &s;hatters, each brittle &s;hatter
would glitter, and &s;parkle &s;till.</P>
<P>So that if the other actors, eminent
as they are, each in his own walk,
will conde&s;cend to allow this &s;uperi|ority
in Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> we think they
will join with us in expelling him the
hou&s;e, as an unruly member, who takes
up &s;o much box, that he elbows off
every body el&s;e; one who&s;e voice is
<PB N="35" REF="30">
&s;o loud, that like that of <HI>Sentor</HI> the
herald, it draws ten thou&s;and voices,
who&s;e tongues &s;o voluble, that he will
not even allow the very women to in|dulge
their favourite faculty of talk|ing.
And &s;ure, when one man can im|po&s;e
&s;ilence upon &s;o many women, a
ta&s;k above the power of all the husbands
in England, or in the world, to perform,
what mu&s;t we think of &s;uch a &s;way?
&s;uch a di&s;potic &s;overeign, arbitrary rule,
&s;hould not be ve&s;ted in any &s;ubject;
and it is more than the Grand Mo|narque,
Lewis him&s;elf would dare to
do in France, where his motto is,
Sic <HI>volo, &s;ic Jubeo,</HI> nay, his favourites
Pompadour would not obey &s;o unrea|&s;onable
a command; and if he had
the confidence to proclaim &s;ilence in a
printed edict, or declaration of his will,
<PB N="36" REF="31">
he would in all human, all moral pro|bability,
rai&s;e an army of female in&s;ur|gents,
to rebel again&s;t his throne, and
like Samp&s;on, pull an old hou&s;e over
his ears; we are delighted with the
&s;weetne&s;s of the female voice, as they
are the mo&s;t harmonious; and &s;hall
Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Pritchard,</HI> Mrs.
<HI>Clive,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Macklin,</HI> and the other ac|tre&s;&s;es,
give up a privilege they have a
right to enjoy, a perogative they have
maintained &s;ince the days of old mother
Eve, who, no doubt, enjoyed it in its
full extent; nor &s;hall we join with
Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> or any other man, or &s;et
of man in the kingdom, to impo&s;e
this unrea&s;onable injunction on women,
who have given us &s;uch uncommon plea|&s;ure,
either in the tender or the ele|vated
tones of their voices.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="32">
It would be an act more cruel than
ca&s;tration to men, by which the Ita|lians
equip their children for the opera,
and I will &s;peak for any of the above
actre&s;&s;es, and promi&s;e this in their name,
that they would think &s;uch <HI>dilapidation</HI>
for procuring men, a voice would be
le&s;s cruel, than to take the voice of
women by any means; nay, I will
vouch for them all, that they would
rather be martyrs, and &s;uffer them&s;elves
to be <HI>&s;toned to death,</HI> as the Italians are
<HI>&s;toned for life,</HI> than to &s;uffer the for|feiture
of &s;o rich a trea&s;ure, or to cede,
by what treaty &s;oever, upon any terms
or conditions, clau&s;e or clau&s;es, that
high and mighty female right, the u&s;e
of their tongues; and therefore we &s;till
continue to affirm, as we have &s;uffici|ently
proved our a&s;&s;ertion, by many &s;o|lid
<PB N="38" REF="33">
rea&s;ons, that this unrea&s;onable man,
<HI>David Garrick,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;hould Not ap|pear
on the &s;tage; and we hope you
will &s;hew him this letter; nay, we re|que&s;t
it of you, and his abdicating
the throne of his ance&s;tors, and re&s;ign|ing
his theatrical authority (we don't
mean management) will for ever oblige,</P>

<P>SOMETHING I intended to
&s;ay when I fir&s;t &s;at down to write
this epi&s;tle, but it &s;lipt my memory, occa|&s;ioned
by the zeal I entertain for exter|pating
Garrick, and has again this mo|ment
occured to me.</P>
<P>In the name of common-&s;en&s;e are
we to have nothing new at your hou&s;e,
is variety never to plea&s;e our ima|gination,
<PB N="40" REF="35">
&s;hall we neither have a new
play, nor a new performer, but will
you per&s;i&s;t, and again lead us through
that beaten path we have all the&s;e ten
years walked in?</P>
<P>If we have not &s;omething new form
you within this mouth, I &s;hall be ne|ce&s;&s;itated
to give my vote, for keep|ing
Garrick at Drury-lane.</P>
<P>Now Sir after having reque&s;ted of
you &s;omething new, I would recom|mend
to your memory &s;ome account of
Mademoi&s;elle de Clairon, a celebrated
actre&s;s at Paris, of whom you doubtle&s;s
have heard; I mean by giving you this
account of her, that you may in&s;truct
the novices that may offer.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="36">
Her fir&s;t appearance is exce&s;&s;ively en|gaging;
&s;he never comes in &s;taring round
upon the company, as if &s;he intended to
count of benefits of the hou&s;e, or at
lea&s;t to &s;ee, as well as be &s;een. Her
eyes are always, at fir&s;t, intently fixed
upon the per&s;ons of the drama, and
&s;he lifts them by degrees, with enchant|ing
diffidence, upon the &s;pectators. Her
fir&s;t &s;peech, or at lea&s;t the fir&s;t part of
it, is delivered with &s;carce any motion
of the arm; her hands and her tongue
never &s;et out together; but the one pre|pares
us for the other. She &s;ome|times
begins with a mute, eloquent
attitude; but never goes forward all at
once with hands, eyes, head, and voice.
This ob&s;ervation, though it may appear
<PB N="42" REF="37">
of no importance &s;hould certainly be
adverted to.</P>
<P>By this &s;imple beginning &s;he gives
her&s;elf a power of ri&s;ing in the &s;cene.
As &s;he proceeds, every ge&s;ture, every
look acquires new violence, till at la&s;t
tran&s;ported, &s;he fills the whole vehe|mence
of the part, and all the idea of
the poet.</P>
<P>Her hands are not alternately &s;tretched
out, and then drawn in again, as with
the &s;inging women at Sadler's-wells; they
are employed with graceful variety, and
every moment plea&s;e with new and un|expected
eloquence.</P>
