<P>Fal&s;e, prevaricating Urganda! Love was your inducement. Have you not &s;tolen the prince from his royal father, and detained him here by your power while a hundred knights are in &s;earch after him?&mdash;Does not every thing about you prove the con&s;equence of your want of honour and faith to me? Were you not plac'd on this happy &s;pot of Arcadia, to be the guardian of its peace and inno|cence? and have not the Arcadians liv'd for ages the envy of le&s;s happy, becau&s;e le&s;s virtuous people?</P>

<P>Why, look ye, Si&s;ter, I am as little inclin'd to bear the&s;e things as your&s;elf; and if my &s;wain had been faithle&s;s too, I &s;hould have been vex'd at it, to be &s;ure; but how can you help your|&s;elf?</P>

<SPEAKER>2d. Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet folks &s;ay, &s;he has no power in love-matters; you know, notwith&s;tanding her charms, and her &s;pirits, &s;he is in love with a fool, and has not wit enough to make him return it.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>1&s;t Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that; if I could not make folks love me, I would make them mi&s;erable and that's the next plea&s;ure to it.</P>

<P>May be &s;o, nor can I help hating and dete&s;ting her, becau&s;e they do fall in love with her.&mdash;Sylvia's good qualities cannot excu&s;e her to me; my quarrel to her is, that all the young fellows fol|low her, not becau&s;e &s;he does not follow the young fellows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but really now, &s;i&s;ter, 'tis a little hard, that a girl, who has beauty to get lovers, or merit enough to keep 'em, &s;hould be hated for her good qualities. <STAGE>(Affectedly.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Marry come up, my in&s;ulting &s;i&s;ter; becau&s;e you think your &s;hepherd con&s;tant, you have no feeling for the fal&s;e-heartedne&s;s of mine.&mdash;But don't be too vain with your &s;ucce&s;s; my Dorilas is made of the &s;ame &s;tuff as your Damon; and I can't for the life of me &s;ee that you have any particular &s;ecurity for your fool, more than I had for mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are you &s;o angry, my dear &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;I am not Sylvia, and to oblige you, I will abu&s;e her wherever I go, and whenever you plea&s;e; I think &s;he is a mo&s;t provoking creature, and I wi&s;h &s;he was out of the country with all my &s;oul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1&s;t Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o &s;he ought to be. She has no bu&s;ine&s;s here with her good qualities. Nobody knows who &s;he is, or whence &s;he came.&mdash;She was left here with old Dorcas, but how, or by whom, or for what, except to make mi&s;chief among us, I know not&mdash;There is &s;ome my&s;tery about her, and I'll find it out.</P>

<STAGE>(Enter peeping in at the &s;tage-door.)</STAGE>

<L>IS the &s;tage clear?&mdash;ble&s;s me!&mdash;I've &s;uch a dread!</L>
<L>It &s;eems enchanted ground, where'er I tread! <STAGE>(Coming forward.</STAGE></L>
<L>What noi&s;e was that!&mdash;hu&s;h!&mdash;'twas a fal&s;e alarm.&mdash;</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure there's no one here will do me harm.</L>
<L>Among&s;t you can't be found a &s;ingle knight,</L>
<L>Who would not do an injur'd dam&s;el right.&mdash;</L>
<L>Well&mdash;heav'n be prais'd, I'm out of magic reach,</L>
<L>And have once more regain'd the pow'r of &s;peech:</L>
<L>Aye, and I'll u&s;e it&mdash;for it mu&s;t appear,</L>
<L>That my poor tongue is greatly in arrear.&mdash;</L>
<L>There's not a female here but &s;har'd my woe,</L>
<L>Ty'd down to YES, or &s;till more hateful NO,</L>
<L>No is expre&s;&s;ive&mdash;but I mu&s;t confe&s;s,</L>
<L>If rightly que&s;tion'd, I'd u&s;e only YES.</L>

<L>In MERLIN's walk this broken wand I found, <STAGE>(Shewing a broken wand.</STAGE></L>
<L>Which to <HI>two words</HI> my &s;peaking organs bound.</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e upon the town I try his &s;pell&mdash;</L>
<L>Ladies, don't &s;tir&mdash;You u&s;e your tongues too well!&mdash;</L>
<L>How tranquil ev'ry place, when, by my &s;kill,</L>
<L>FOLLY is mute, and even SLANDER &s;till!</L>
<L>Old go&s;&s;ips &s;peechle&s;s&mdash;<HI>bloods</HI> would breed no riot,</L>
<L>And all the tongues at JONATHAN's lie quiet!</L>
<L>Each <HI>grave profe&s;&s;ion</HI> mu&s;t new bu&s;h the wig;</L>
<L>Nothing to &s;ay, 'twere needful they look big!</L>
<L>The <HI>reverend doctor</HI> might the change endure,</L>
<L>He would &s;it &s;till, and have his <HI>&s;ine cure!</HI></L>
<L>Nor could <HI>great folks</HI> much hard&s;hip undergo;</L>
<L>They do their busine&s;s with an AYE or NO!&mdash;</L>
<L>But, come, I only jok'd&mdash;di&s;mi&s;s your fear;</L>
<L>Tho' I've the pow'r, I will not u&s;e it here.</L>
<L>I'll only keep my magic, as a guard,</L>
<L>To awe each critic, who attacks our bard.</L>
<L>I &s;ee &s;ome malecontents their &s;ingers biting,</L>
<L>Snarling, " The ancients never knew &s;uch writing&mdash;</L>
<L>" The drama's lo&s;t!&mdash;the managers exhau&s;t us</L>

<L>Dread Sirs, a word!&mdash;the public ta&s;te is fickle;</L>
<L>All palates in their turn we &s;trive to tickle;</L>
<L>Our cat'rers <HI>vary,</HI> and you'll own at lea&s;t,</L>
<L>It is <HI>variety</HI> that makes the fea&s;t.</L>
<L>If this fair circle &s;mile&mdash;and the <HI>gods</HI> thunder,</L>
<L>I with this wand will heep the critics under.</L>
