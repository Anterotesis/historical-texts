<P>ON the plea&s;ant banks of the Garonne,
in the province of Ga&s;cony, &s;tood, in the
year 1584, the chateau of Mon&s;ieur St.
Aubert. From its windows were &s;een
the pa&s;toral land&s;capes of Guienne and
Ga&s;cony, &s;tretching along the river, gay
with luxuriant woods and vines, and
plantations of olives. To the &s;outh, the
view was bounded by the maje&s;tic Pyre|n&eacute;es,
who&s;e &s;ummits, veiled in clouds, or
<PB N="2" REF="4">
exhibiting awful forms, &s;een, and lo&s;t
again, as the partial vapours rolled along,
were &s;ometimes barren, and gleamed
through the blue tinge of air, and &s;ome|times
frowned with fore&s;ts of gloomy
pine, that &s;wept downward to their
ba&s;e. The&s;e tremendous precipices were
contra&s;ted by the &s;oft green of the pa&s;|tures
and woods that hung upon their
&s;kirts; among who&s;e flocks, and herds,
and &s;imple cottages, the eye, after having
&s;caled the cliffs above, delighted to re|po&s;e.
To the north, and to the ea&s;t, the
plains of Guienne and Languedoc were
lo&s;t in the mi&s;t of di&s;tance; on the we&s;t,
Ga&s;cony was bounded by the waters of
Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with
his wife and daughter, on the margin of
the Garonne, and to li&s;ten to the mu&s;ic
that floated on its waves. He had known
life in other forms than tho&s;e of pa&s;to|ral
&s;implicity, having mingled in the gay
and in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the world; but
<PB N="3" REF="5">
the flattering portrait of mankind, which
his heart had delineated in early youth,
his experience had too &s;orrowfully cor|rected.
Yet, amid&s;t the changing vi&s;ions
of life, his principles remained un&s;haken,
his benevolence unchilled; and he retir|ed
from the multitude "more in <HI>pity</HI>
than in anger," to &s;cenes of &s;imple na|ture,
to the pure delights of literature,
and to the exerci&s;e of dome&s;tic virtues.</P>
<P>He was a de&s;cendant from the younger
branch of an illu&s;trious family, and
it was de&s;igned, that the deficiency of
his patrimonial wealth &s;hould be &s;upplied
either by a &s;plendid alliance in marriage,
or by &s;ucce&s;s in the intrigues of public
affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a
&s;en&s;e of honour to fulfil the latter hope,
and too &s;mall a portion of ambition to
&s;acrifice what he called happine&s;s, to the
attainment of wealth. After the death
of his father he married a very amiable
woman, his equal in birth, and not his
&s;uperior in fortune. The late Mon&s;ieur
<PB N="4" REF="6">
St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance,
had &s;o much involved his affairs, that his
&s;on found it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e of a part
of the family domain, and, &s;ome years
after his marriage, he &s;old it to Mon&s;ieur
Que&s;nel, the brother of his wife, and re|tired
to a &s;mall e&s;tate in Ga&s;cony, where
conjugal felicity, and parental duties, di|vided
his attention with the trea&s;ures of
knowledge and the illuminations of ge|nius.</P>
<P>To this &s;pot he had been attached from
his infancy. He had often made excur|&s;ions
to it when a boy, and the impre&s;|&s;ions
of delight given to his mind by the
homely kindne&s;s of the grey-headed pea|&s;ant,
to whom it was intru&s;ted, and
who&s;e fruit and cream never failed, had
not been obliterated by &s;ucceeding cir|cum&s;tances.
The green pa&s;tures along
which he had &s;o often bounded in the
exultation of health, and youthful free|dom&mdash;the
woods, under who&s;e refreshing
&s;hade he had fir&s;t indulged that pen&s;ive
<PB N="5" REF="7">
melancholy, which afterwards made a
&s;trong feature of his character&mdash;the wild
walks of the mountains, the river, on
who&s;e wav&eacute;s he had floated, and the di&s;|tant
plains, which &s;eemed boundle&s;s as
his early hopes&mdash;were never after re|membered
by St. Aubert but with enthu|&s;ia&s;m
and regret. At length he di&s;en|gaged
him&s;elf from the world, and re|tired
hither, to realize the wi&s;hes of
many years.</P>
<P>The building, as it then &s;tood, was
merely a &s;ummer cottage, rendered inte|re&s;ting
to a &s;tranger by its neat &s;impli|city,
or the beauty of the &s;urrounding
&s;cene; and con&s;iderable additions were
nece&s;&s;ary to make it a comfortable fami|ly
re&s;idence. St. Aubert felt a kind of
affection for every part of the fabric,
which he remembered in his youth, and
would not &s;uffer a &s;tone of it to be re|moved,
&s;o that the new building, adapt|ed
to the &s;tyle of the old one, formed
with it only a &s;imple and elegant re&s;i|dence.
<PB N="6" REF="8">
The ta&s;te of Madame St. Aubert
was con&s;picuous in its internal fini&s;h|ing,
where the &s;ame cha&s;te &s;implicity
was ob&s;ervable in the furniture, and in
the few ornaments of the apartments,
that characteri&s;ed the manners of its in|habitants.</P>
<P>The library occupied the we&s;t &s;ide of
the chateau, and was enriched by a col|lection
of the be&s;t books in the ancient and
modern languages. This room opened
upon a grove, which &s;tood on the brow
of a gentle declivity, that fell towards the
river, and the tall trees gave it a melan|choly
and plea&s;ing &s;hade; while from
the windows the eye caught, beneath the
&s;preading branches, the gay and luxu|riant
land&s;cape &s;tretching to the we&s;t,
and overlooked on the left by the bold
precipices of the Pyren&eacute;es. Adjoining
the library was a green-hou&s;e, &s;tored with
&s;carce and beautiful plants; for one of
the amu&s;ements of St. Aubert was the
&s;tudy of botany, and among the neigh|bouring
<PB N="7" REF="9">
mountains, which afforded a lux|urious
fea&s;t to the mind of the naturali&s;t,
he often pa&s;&s;ed the day in the pur&s;uits
of his favourite &s;cience. He was &s;ome|times
accompanied in the&s;e little excur|&s;ions
by Madame St. Aubert, and fre|quently
by his daughter; when, with a
&s;mall o&s;ier ba&s;ket to receive plants, and
another filled with cold refre&s;hments,
&s;uch as the cabin of the &s;hepherd did
not afford, they wandered away among
the mo&s;t romantic and magnificent &s;cenes,
nor &s;uffered the charms of Nature's low|ly
children to ab&s;tract them from the ob|&s;ervance
of her &s;tupendous works. When
weary of &s;auntering among cliffs that
&s;eemed &s;carcely acce&s;&s;ible but to the
&s;teps of the enthu&s;ia&s;t, and where no
track appeared on the vegetation, but
what the foot of the izard had left; they
would &s;eek one of tho&s;e green rece&s;&s;es,
which &s;o beauti&s;ully adorn the bo&s;om of
the&s;e mountains, where, under the &s;hade
of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed
<PB N="8" REF="10">
their &s;imple repa&s;t, made &s;weeter by the
waters of the cool &s;tream, that crept
along the turf, and by the breath of wild
flowers and aromatic plants, that fringed
the rocks, and inlaid the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Adjoining the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the green|hou&s;e,
looking towards the plains of Lan|guedoc,
was a room, which Emily called
hers, and which contained her books, her
drawings, her mu&s;ical in&s;truments, with
&s;ome favourite birds and plants. Here &s;he
u&s;ually exerci&s;ed her&s;elf in elegant arts,
cultivated only becau&s;e they were conge|nial
to her ta&s;te, and in which native ge|nius,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the in&s;tructions of Mon|&s;ieur
and Madame St. Aubert, made her
an early pro&s;icient. The windows of
this room were particularly plea&s;ant;
they de&s;cended to the floor, and, opening
upon the little lawn that &s;urrounded the
hou&s;e, the eye was led between groves of
almond, palm-trees, flowering-a&s;h, and
myrtle, to the di&s;tant land&s;cape, where
the Garonne wandered.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
The pea&s;ants of this gay climate were
often &s;een on an evening, when the day's
labour was done, dancing in groups on
the margin of the river. Their &s;prightly
melodies, <HI>debonnaire</HI> &s;teps, the fanciful
figure of their dances, with the ta&s;teful
and capricious manner in which the girls
adju&s;ted their &s;imple dre&s;s, gave a charac|ter
to the &s;cene entirely French.</P>
<P>The front of the chateau, which, having
a &s;outhern a&s;pect, opened upon the gran|deur
of the mountains, was occupied on
the ground floor by a ru&s;tic hall, and two
excellent &s;itting rooms. The fir&s;t floor, for
the cottage had no &s;econd &s;tory, was laid
out in bed-chambers, except one apartment
that opened to a balcony, and which was
generally u&s;ed for a breakfa&s;t-room.</P>
<P>In the &s;urrounding ground, St. Au|bert
had made very ta&s;teful improve|ments;
yet, &s;uch was his attachment to
objects he had remembered from his boy|i&s;h
days, that he had in &s;ome in&s;tances
&s;acrificed ta&s;te to &s;entiment. There were
<PB N="10" REF="12">
two old larches that &s;haded the building,
and interrupted the pro&s;pect; St. Aubert
had &s;ometimes declared that he believed
he &s;hould have been weak enough to have
wept at their fall. In addition to the&s;e
larches he planted a little grove of beech,
pine, and mountain-a&s;h. On a lofty terrace,
formed by the &s;welling bank of the river,
ro&s;e a plantation of orange, lemon and
palm-trees, who&s;e fruit, in the coolne&s;s
of evening, breathed delicious fragrance.
With the&s;e were mingled a few trees of
other &s;pecies. Here, under the ample
&s;hade of a plane-tree, that &s;pread its ma|je&s;tic
canopy towards the river, St. Au|bert
loved to &s;it in the fine evenings of
&s;ummer, with his wife and children,
watching, beneath its foliage, the &s;etting|&s;un,
the mild &s;plendour of its light, fad|ing
from the di&s;tant land&s;cape, till the
&s;hadows of twilight melted its various
features into one tint of &s;ober gray. Here,
too, he loved to read, and to conver&s;e
with Madame St. Aubert; or to play
<PB N="11" REF="13">
with his children, re&s;igning him&s;elf to
the influence of tho&s;e &s;weet affections,
which are ever attendant on &s;implicity
and nature. He has often &s;aid, while
tears of plea&s;ure trembled in his eyes, that
the&s;e were moments infinitely more delight|ful
than any pa&s;&s;ed amid the brilliant and
tumultuous &s;cenes that are courted by the
world. His heart was occupied; it had,
what can be &s;o rarely &s;aid, no wi&s;h for a
happine&s;s beyond what it experienced.
The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting right diffu&s;ed
a &s;erenity over his manners, which no|thing
el&s;e could impart to a man of mo|ral
perceptions like his, and which refin|ed
his &s;en&s;e of every &s;urrounding ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The deepe&s;t &s;hade of twilight did not
&s;end him from his favourite plane-tree.
He loved the &s;oothing hour, when the
la&s;t tints of light die away; when the
&s;tars, one by one, tremble through aether,
and are reflected on the dark mirror of
the waters; that hour, which, of all
others, in&s;pires the mind with pen&s;ive ten|derne&s;s,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and often elevates it to &s;ublime
contemplation. When the moon &s;hed
her &s;oft rays among the foliage, he &s;till
lingered, and his pa&s;toral &s;upper of cream
and fruits was often &s;pread beneath it.
Then, on the &s;tillne&s;s of night, came the
&s;ong of the nightingale, breathing &s;weet|ne&s;s,
and awakening melancholy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t interruptions to the happine&s;s
he had known &s;ince his retirement, were
occa&s;ioned by the death of his two &s;ons.
He lo&s;t them at that age when infantine
&s;implicity is &s;o fa&s;cinating; and though,
in con&s;ideration of Madame St. Aubert's
di&s;tre&s;s, he re&s;trained the expre&s;&s;ion of
his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as
he meant, with philo&s;ophy, he had, in
truth, no philo&s;ophy that could render
him calm to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es. One daughter was
now his only &s;urviving child; and, while he
watched the unfolding of her infant cha|racter,
with anxious fondne&s;s, he endeavour|ed,
with unremitting effort, to counteract
tho&s;e traits in her di&s;po&s;ition, which might
<PB N="13" REF="15">
hereafter lead her from happine&s;s. She had
di&s;covered in her early years uncommon de|licacy
of mind, warm affections, and ready
benevolence; but with the&s;e was ob&s;erv|able
a degree of &s;u&s;ceptibility too exqui|&s;ite
to admit of la&s;ting peace. As &s;he
advanced in youth, this &s;en&s;ibility gave a
pen&s;ive tone to her &s;pirits, and a &s;oftne&s;s
to her manner, which added grace to
beauty, and rendered her a very intere&s;t|ing
object to per&s;ons of a congenial di&s;|po&s;ition.
But St. Aubert had too much
good &s;en&s;e to prefer a charm to a virtue;
and had penetration enough to &s;ee, that
this charm was too dangerous to its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or
to be allowed the character of a
ble&s;&s;ing. He endeavoured, therefore, to
&s;trengthen her mind; to enure her to ha|bits
of &s;elf-command; to teach her to
reject the fir&s;t impul&s;e of her feelings, and
to look, with cool examination, upon the
di&s;appointments he &s;ometimes threw in
her way. While he in&s;tructed her to re|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="16">
fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and to acquire that
&s;teady dignity of mind, that can alone
counterbalance the pa&s;&s;ions, and bear us,
as far as is compatible with our nature,
above the reach of circum&s;tances, he
taught him&s;elf a le&s;&s;on of fortitude; for
he was often obliged to witne&s;s, with
&s;eeming indifference, the tears and &s;trug|gles
which his caution occa&s;ioned her.</P>
<P>In per&s;on, Emily re&s;embled her mo|ther;
having the &s;ame elegant &s;ymmetry
of form, the &s;ame delicacy of features,
and the &s;ame blue eyes, full of tender
&s;weetne&s;s. But, lovely as was her per&s;on,
it was the varied expre&s;&s;ion of her coun|tenance,
as conver&s;ation awakened the
nicer emotions of her mind, that threw
&s;uch a captivating grace around her:</P>
<Q><L>Tho&s;e tend'rer tints, that &s;hun the carele&s;s eye,</L>
<L>And, in the world's contagious circle, die.</L></Q>
<P>St. Aubert cultivated her under&s;tand|ing
with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care. He
<PB N="15" REF="17">
gave her a general view of the &s;ciences,
and an exact acquaintance with every
part of elegant literature. He taught
her Latin and Engli&s;h, chiefly that &s;he
might under&s;tand the &s;ublimity of their
be&s;t poets. She di&s;covered in her early
years a ta&s;te for works of genius; and it
was St. Aubert's principle, as well as his
inclination, to promote every innocent
means of happine&s;s. "A well-inform|ed
mind," he would &s;ay, "is the be&s;t &s;e|curity
again&s;t the contagion of folly and
of vice. The vacant mind is ever on the
watch for relief, and ready to plunge in|to
error, to e&s;cape from the languor of
idlene&s;s. Store it with ideas, teach it the
plea&s;ure of thinking; and the tempta|tions
of the world without, will be coun|teracted
by the gratifications derived
from the world within. Thought, and
cultivation, are nece&s;&s;ary equally to the
happine&s;s of a country and a city life;
in the fir&s;t they prevent the unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions
of indolence, and afford a &s;ublime
<PB N="16" REF="18">
plea&s;ure in the ta&s;te they create for the
beautiful, and the grand; in the latter,
they make di&s;&s;ipation le&s;s an object of
nece&s;&s;ity, and con&s;equently of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It was one of Emily's earlie&s;t plea&s;ures
to ramble among the &s;cenes of nature;
nor was it in the &s;oft and glowing land|&s;cape
that &s;he mo&s;t delighted; &s;he loved
more the wild wood-walks, that &s;kirted
the mountain; and &s;till more the moun|tain's
&s;tupendous rece&s;&s;es, where the &s;i|lence
and grandeur of &s;olitude impre&s;&s;ed
a &s;acred awe upon her heart, and lifted
her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN
AND EARTH. In &s;cenes like the&s;e &s;he
would often linger alone, wrapt in a me|lancholy
charm, till the la&s;t gleam of day
faded from the we&s;t; till the lonely &s;ound
of a &s;heep-bell, or the di&s;tant bark of a
watch-dog, were all that broke on the
&s;tillne&s;s of the evening. Then, the gloom
of the woods; the trembling of their
leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat,
flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
now &s;een, and now lo&s;t&mdash;were circum|&s;tances
that awakened her mind into ef|fort,
and led to enthu&s;ia&s;m and poetry.</P>
<P>Her favourite walk was to a little fi&s;h|ing-hou&s;e,
belonging to St. Aubert, in a
woody glen, on the margin of a rivulet
that de&s;cended from the Pyren&eacute;es, and,
after foaming among their rocks, wound
its &s;ilent way beneath the &s;hades it re|flected.
Above the woods, that &s;creened
this glen, ro&s;e the lofty &s;ummits of the
Pyren&eacute;es, which often bur&s;t boldly on
the eye through the glades below. Some|times
the &s;hattered face of a rock only was
&s;een, crowned with wild &s;hrubs; or a
&s;hepherd's cabin &s;eated on a cliff, over|&s;hadowed
by dark cypre&s;s, or waving a&s;h.
Emerging from the deep rece&s;&s;es of the
woods, the glade opened to the di&s;tant
land&s;cape, where the rich pa&s;tures and
vine covered &s;lopes of Ga&s;cony gradually
declined to the plains; and there, on the
winding &s;hores of the Garonne, groves,
and hamlets, and villas,&mdash;their outlines
<PB N="18" REF="20">
&s;oftened by di&s;tance, melted from the
eye into one rich harmonious tint.</P>
<P>This, too, was the favourite retreat of
St. Aubert, to which he frequently with|drew
from the fervour of noon, with his
wife, his daughter, and his books; or
came at the &s;weet evening hour to wel|come
the &s;ilent du&s;k, or to li&s;ten for
the mu&s;ic of the nightingale. Sometimes,
too, he brought mu&s;ic of his own, and
awakened every fairy echo with the ten|der
accents of his oboe; and often have
the tones of Emily's voice drawn &s;weet|ne&s;s
from the waves, over which they
trembled.</P>
<P>It was in one of her excur&s;ions to this
&s;pot, that &s;he ob&s;erved the following lines
written with a pencil on a part of the
wain&s;cot:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Go, pencil! faithful to thy ma&s;ter's &s;ighs!</L>
<L>Go&mdash;tell the Godde&s;s of this fairy &s;cene,</L>
<L>When next her light &s;teps wind the&s;e wood-walks
green,</L>
<L>Whence all his tears, his tender &s;orrows, ri&s;e:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21">
Ah! paint her form, her &s;oul-illumin'd eyes,</L>
<L>The &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion of her pen&s;ive face,</L>
<L>The light'ning &s;mile, the animated grace&mdash;</L>
<L>The portrait well the lover's voice &s;upplies;</L>
<L>Speaks all his heart mu&s;t feel, his tongue would
&s;ay:</L>
<L>Yet ah! not all his heart mu&s;t &s;adly feel!</L>
<L>How oft the flow'ret's &s;ilken leaves conceal</L>
<L>The drag that &s;teals the vital &s;park away!</L>
<L>And who that gazes on that angel-&s;mile,</L>
<L>Would fear its charm, or think it could be|guile!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The&s;e lines were not in&s;cribed to any
per&s;on; Emily therefore could not apply
them to her&s;elf, though &s;he was undoubt|edly
the nymph of the&s;e &s;hades. Having
glanced round the little circle of her ac|quaintance
without being detained by a
&s;u&s;picion as to whom they could be ad|dre&s;&s;ed,
&s;he was compelled to re&s;t in un|certainty;
an uncertainty which would
have been more painful to an idle mind
than it was to hers. She had no lei&s;ure
to &s;uffer this circum&s;tance, trifling at fir&s;t,
to &s;well into importance by frequent re|membrance
<PB N="20" REF="22">
The little vanity it had ex|cited
(for the incertitude which forbade
her to pre&s;ume upon having in&s;pired the
&s;onnet, forbade her al&s;o to di&s;believe it)
pa&s;&s;ed away, and the incident was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
from her thoughts amid her books, her &s;tu|dies,
and the exerci&s;e of &s;ocial charities.</P>
<P>Soon after this period, her anxiety was
awakened by the indi&s;po&s;ition of her fa|ther,
who was attacked with a fever;
which, though not thought to be of a
dangerous kind, gave a &s;evere &s;hock to
his con&s;titution. Madame St. Aubert
and Emily attended him with unremitting
care; but his recovery was very &s;low,
and, as he advanced towards health, Ma|dame
&s;eemed to decline.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene he vi&s;ited, after he was
well enough to take the air, was his fa|vourite
fi&s;hing-hou&s;e. A ba&s;ket of provi|&s;ions
was &s;ent thither, with books, and
Emily's lute; for fi&s;hing-tackle he had
to u&s;e, for he never could find amu&s;e|ment
in torturing or de&s;troying.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
After employing him&s;elf, for about an
hour, in botanizing, dinner was &s;erved.
It was a repa&s;t, to which gratitude, for
being again permitted to vi&s;it this &s;pot,
gave &s;weetne&s;s; and family happine&s;s once
more &s;miled beneath the&s;e &s;hades. Mon|&s;ieur
St. Aubert conver&s;ed with unu&s;ual
cheerfulne&s;s; every object delighted his
&s;en&s;es. The refre&s;hing plea&s;ure from the
fir&s;t view of nature, after the pain of ill|ne&s;s,
and the confinement of a &s;ick-cham|ber,
is above the conceptions, as well as
the de&s;criptions, of tho&s;e in health. The
green woods and pa&s;tures; the flowery
turf; the blue concave of the heavens;
the balmy air; the murmur of the limpid
&s;tream; and even the hum of every little
in&s;ect of the &s;hade, &s;eem to revivify the
&s;oul, and make mere exi&s;tence bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Madame St. Aubert, reanimated by
the cheerfulne&s;s and recovery of her hu&s;|band,
was no longer &s;en&s;ible of the in|di&s;po&s;ition
which had lately oppre&s;&s;ed
her; and, as &s;he &s;auntered along the
<PB N="22" REF="24">
wood walks of this romantic glen, and
conver&s;ed with him, and with her daugh|ter,
&s;he often looked at them alternately
with a degree of tenderne&s;s, that filled her
eyes with tears. St. Aubert ob&s;erved
this more than once, and gently reproved
her for the emotion; but &s;he could only
&s;mile, cla&s;p his hand, and that of Emi|ly,
and weep the more. He felt the ten|der
enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;tealing upon him&s;elf in a
degree that became almo&s;t painful; his
features a&s;&s;umed a &s;erious air, and he
could not forbear &s;ecretly &s;ighing&mdash;"Perhaps
I &s;hall &s;ome time look back to
the&s;e moments, as to the &s;ummit of my
happine&s;s, with hopele&s;s regret. But let
me not mi&s;u&s;e them by u&s;ele&s;s anticipa|tion;
let me hope I &s;hall not live to
mourn the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who are dearer
to me than life."</P>
<P>To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the
pen&s;ive temper of his mind, hebade Emily
fetch the lute &s;he knew how to touch with
&s;uch &s;weet pathos. As &s;he drew near the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear
the tones of the in&s;trument, which were
awakened by the hand of ta&s;te, and ut|tered
a plaintive air, who&s;e exqui&s;ite me|lody
engaged all her attention. She li&s;ten|ed
in profound &s;ilence, afraid to move
from the &s;pot, le&s;t the &s;ound of her &s;teps
&s;hould occa&s;ion her to lo&s;e a note of the
mu&s;ic, or &s;hould di&s;turb the mu&s;ician.
Every thing without the building was
&s;till, and no per&s;on appeared. She conti|nued
to li&s;ten, till timidity &s;ucceeded to
&s;urpri&s;e and delight; a timidity, increa&s;ed
by a remembrance of the pencilled lines
&s;he had formerly &s;een, and &s;he he&s;itated
whether to proceed, or to return.</P>
<P>While &s;he pau&s;ed, the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed;
and, after a momentary he&s;itation, &s;he re|collected
courage to advance to the fi&s;h|ing-hou&s;e,
which &s;he entered with falter|ing
&s;teps, and found unoccupied! Her lute
lay on the table; every thing &s;eemed un|di&s;turbed,
and &s;he began to believe it was
another in&s;trument &s;he had heard, till &s;he
<PB N="24" REF="26">
remembered, that, when &s;he followed M.
and Madame St. Aubert from this &s;pot,
her lute was left on a window &s;eat. She
felt alarmed, yet knew not wherefore;
the melancholy gloom of evening, and
the profound &s;tillne&s;s of the place, inter|rupted
only by the light trembling of
leaves, heightened her fanciful apprehen|&s;ions,
and &s;he was de&s;irous of quitting
the building, but perceived her&s;elf grow
faint, and &s;at down. As &s;he tried to re|cover
her&s;elf, the pencilled lines on the
wain&s;cot met her eye; &s;he &s;tarted, as if
&s;he had &s;een a &s;tranger; but, endeavour|ing
to conquer the tremour of her &s;pi|rits,
ro&s;e, and went to the window. To
the lines before noticed &s;he now perceived
that others were added, in which her name
appeared.</P>
<P>Though no longer &s;uffered to doubt
that they were addre&s;&s;ed to her&s;elf, &s;he
was as ignorant, as before, by whom
they could be written. While &s;he mu&s;ed,
&s;he thought &s;he heard the found of a
<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;tep without the building, and again
alarmed, &s;he caught up her lute, and hur|ried
away. Mon&s;ieur and Madame St.
Aubert &s;he found in a little path that
wound along the &s;ides of the glen.</P>
<P>Having reached a green &s;ummit, &s;ha|dowed
by palm-trees, and overlooking
the vallies and plains of Ga&s;cony, they
&s;eated them&s;elves on the turf; and while
their eyes wandered over the glorious
&s;cene, and they inhaled the &s;weet breath
of flowers and herbs that enriched the
gra&s;s, Emily played and &s;ung &s;everal of
their favourite airs, with the delicacy of
expre&s;&s;ion in which &s;he &s;o much excelled.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic and conver&s;ation detained them
in this enchanting &s;pot, till the &s;un's la&s;t
light &s;tept upon the plains; till the white
&s;ails that glided beneath the mountains,
where the Garonne wandered, became
dim, and the gloom of evening &s;tole over
the land&s;cape. It was a melancholy but
not unplea&s;ing gloom. St. Aubert and
his family ro&s;e, and left the place with
<PB N="26" REF="28">
regret; alas! Madame St. Aubert knew
not that &s;he left it for ever.</P>
<P>When they reached the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e
&s;he mi&s;&s;ed her bracelet, and recollected
that &s;he had taken it from her arm after
dinner, and had left it on the table when
&s;he went to walk. After a long &s;earch,
in which Emily was very active, &s;he was
compelled to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the lo&s;s of
it. What made this bracelet valuable
to her was a miniature of her daughter
to which it was attached, e&s;teemed a
&s;triking re&s;emblance, and which had been
painted only a few months before. When
Emily was convinced that the bracelet
was really gone, &s;he blu&s;hed, and became
thoughtful. That &s;ome &s;tranger had
been in the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, during her ab|&s;ence,
her lute, and the additional lines of
a pencil, had already informed her: from
the purport of the&s;e lines it was not un|rea&s;onable
to believe, that the poet, the
mu&s;ician, and the thief were the &s;ame per|&s;on.
But though the mu&s;ic &s;he had heard
<PB N="27" REF="29">
the written lines &s;he had &s;een, and the di&s;|appearance
of the picture, formed a com|bination
of circum&s;tances very remarkable,
&s;he was irre&s;i&s;tibly re&s;trained from men|tioning
them; &s;ecretly determining, how|ever,
never again to vi&s;it the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e
without Mon&s;ieur or Madame St. Aubert.</P>
<P>They returned pen&s;ively to the chateau,
Emily mu&s;ing on the incident which had
ju&s;t occurred; St. Aubert reflecting, with
placid gratitude, on the ble&s;&s;ings he po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed;
and Madame St. Aubert &s;omewhat
di&s;turbed, and perplexed, by the lo&s;s of
her daughter's picture. As they drew
near the hou&s;e, they ob&s;erved an
unu&s;ual bu&s;tle about it; the &s;ound of
voices was di&s;tinctly heard, &s;ervants and
hor&s;es were &s;een pa&s;&s;ing between the trees,
and, at length, the wheels of a carriage
rolled along. Having come within view of
the front of the chateau, a landau, with
&s;moking hor&s;es, appeared on the little
lawn before it. St. Aubert perceived the
liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the
<PB N="28" REF="30">
parlour he found Mon&s;ieur and Madame
Que&s;nel already entered. They had left
Paris &s;ome days before, and were on the
way to their e&s;tate, only ten leagues di&s;|tant
from La Vall&eacute;e, and which Mon|&s;ieur
Que&s;nel had purcha&s;ed &s;everal years
before of St. Aubert. This gentleman
was the only brother of Madame St. Au|bert;
but the ties of relation&s;hip having
never been &s;trengthened by congeniality
of character, the intercour&s;e between them
had not been frequent. M. Que&s;nel had
lived altogether in the world; his aim
had been con&s;equence; &s;plendour was
the object of his ta&s;te; and his addre&s;s and
knowledge of character had carried him
forward to the attainment of almo&s;t all
that he had courted. By a man of &s;uch
a di&s;po&s;ition, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the
virtues of St. Aubert &s;hould be overlook|ed;
or that his pure ta&s;te, &s;implicity, and
moderated wi&s;hes, were con&s;idered as
marks of a weak intellect, and of con|fined
views. The marriage of his &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="29" REF="31">
with St. Aubert had been mortifying to
his ambition, for he had de&s;igned that
the matrimonial connection &s;he form|ed
&s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him to attain the con&s;e|quence
which he &s;o much de&s;ired; and
&s;ome offers were made her by per&s;ons
who&s;e rank and fortune flattered his
warme&s;t hope. But his &s;i&s;ter, who was
then addre&s;&s;ed al&s;o by St. Aubert, per|ceived,
or thought &s;he perceived, that
happine&s;s and &s;plendour were not the
&s;ame, and &s;he did not he&s;itate to forego
the la&s;t for the attainment of the former.
Whether Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel thought them
the &s;ame, or not, he would readily have &s;a|crificed
his &s;i&s;ter's peace to the gratifica|tion
of his own ambition; and, on her
marriage with St. Aubert, expre&s;&s;ed in
private his contempt of her &s;piritle&s;s con|duct,
and of the connection which it per|mitted.
Madame St. Aubert, though &s;he
concealed this in&s;ult from her hu&s;band,
felt, perhaps, for the fir&s;t time, re&s;entment
lighted in her heart; and, though a re|gard
<PB N="30" REF="32">
for her own dignity, united with
con&s;iderations of prudence, re&s;trained her
expre&s;&s;ion of this re&s;entment, there was
ever after a mild re&s;erve in her manner
towards M. Que&s;nel, which he both un|der&s;tood
and felt.</P>
<P>In his own marriage he did not follow
his &s;i&s;ter's example. His lady was an
Italian, and an heire&s;s by birth; and, by
nature and education, was a vain and fri|volous
woman.</P>
<P>They now determined to pa&s;s the
night with St. Aubert; and as the cha|teau
was not large enough to accommo|date
their &s;ervants, the latter were di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed
to the neighbouring village. When
the fir&s;t compliments were over, and the
arrangements for the night made, M.
Que&s;nel began the di&s;play of his intelli|gence
and his connections; while St.
Aubert, who had been long enough in
retirement to find the&s;e topics recom|mended
by their novelty, li&s;tened, with
a degree of patience and attention, which
<PB N="31" REF="33">
his gue&s;t mi&s;took for the humility of
wonder. The latter, indeed, de&s;cribed
the few fe&s;tivities which the turbulence
of that period permitted to the court of
Henry the Third, with a minutene&s;s, that
&s;omewhat recompen&s;ed for his o&s;tenta|tion;
but, when he came to &s;peak of the
character of the Duke de Joyeu&s;e, of a
&s;ecret treaty, which he knew to be nego|ciating
with the Porte, and of the light
in which Henry of Navarre was received,
M. St. Aubert recollected enough of
his former experience to be a&s;&s;ured, that
his gue&s;t could be only of an inferior
cla&s;s of politicians; and that, from the
importance of the &s;ubjects upon which he
committed him&s;elf, he could not be of
the rank to which he pretended to be|long.
The opinions delivered by M.
Que&s;nel, were &s;uch as St. Aubert forbore
to reply to, for he knew that his gue&s;t
had neither humanity to feel, nor di&s;cern|ment
to perceive, what is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Madame Que&s;nel, meanwhile, was ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="32" REF="34">
to Madame St. Aubert her a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
that &s;he could bear to pa&s;s her life
in this remote corner of the world, as &s;he
called it, and de&s;cribing, from a wi&s;h, pro|bably,
of exciting envy, the &s;plendour of
the balls, banquets, and proce&s;&s;ions which
had ju&s;t been given by the court, in ho|nour
of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeu&s;e
with Margaretta of Lorrain, the &s;i&s;ter of
the Queen. She de&s;cribed with equal mi|nutene&s;s
the magnificence &s;he had &s;een,
and that from which &s;he had been ex|cluded;
while Emily's vivid fancy, as
&s;he li&s;tened with the ardent curio&s;ity of
youth, heightened the &s;cenes &s;he heard of;
and Madame St. Aubert, looking on her
family, felt, as a tear &s;tole to her eye,
that though &s;plendour may grace happi|ne&s;s,
virtue only can be&s;tow it.</P>
<P>"It is now twelve years, St. Aubert," &s;aid
M. Que&s;nel, "&s;ince I purcha&s;ed your fa|mily
e&s;tate."&mdash;"Somewhere thereabout,"
replied St. Aubert, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh. "It
is near five years &s;ince I have been there,"
<PB N="33" REF="35">
re&s;umed Que&s;nel; "for Paris and its neigh|bourhood
is the only place in the world
to live in, and I am &s;o immer&s;ed in politics,
and have &s;o many affairs of moment on
my hands, that I find it difficult to &s;teal
away even for a month or two." St.
Aubert remaining &s;ilent, M. Que&s;nel pro|ceeded:
"I have &s;ometimes wondered
how you, who have, lived in the capital,
and have been accu&s;tomed to company,
can exi&s;t el&s;ewhere;&mdash;e&s;pecially in &s;o re|mote
a country as this, where you can
neither hear nor fee any thing, and can in
&s;hort be &s;carcely con&s;cious of life."</P>
<P>"I live for my family and my&s;elf," &s;aid:
St. Aubert; "I am now contented to know
only happine&s;s;&mdash;formerly I knew life."</P>
<P>"I mean to expend thirty or forty
thou&s;and livres on improvements," &s;aid.
M. Que&s;nel, without &s;eeming to notice
the words of St. Aubert; "for I de&s;ign,
next &s;ummer, to bring here my friends,
the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis
Ramont, to pa&s;s a month or two with
<PB N="34" REF="36">
me." To St. Aubert's enquiry, as to
the&s;e intended improvements, he replied,
that he &s;hould take down the old ea&s;t wing
of the chateau, and rai&s;e upon the &s;ite a
&s;et of &s;tables. "Then I &s;hall build," &s;aid
he, "<HI>a &s;alle &agrave; manger,</HI> a <HI>&s;alon,</HI> a <HI>&s;alle au
commune,</HI> and a number of rooms for &s;er|vants;
for at pre&s;ent there is not accom|modation
for a third part of my own
people."</P>
<P>"It accommodated our father's hou&s;e-hold,"
&s;aid St. Aubert, grieved that the
old man&s;ion was to be thus improved,
"and that was not a &s;mall one."</P>
<P>"Our notions are &s;omewhat enlarged
&s;ince tho&s;e days," &s;aid M. Que&s;nel;&mdash;"what
was then thought a decent &s;tyle of
living would not now be endured." Even
the calm St. Aubert blu&s;hed at the&s;e
words, but his anger &s;oon yielded to con|tempt.
"The ground about the chateau
is encumbered with trees; I mean to cut
&s;ome of them down."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
"Cut down the trees too!" &s;aid St.
Aubert.</P>
<P>"Certainly. Why &s;hould I not? they
interrupt my pro&s;pects. There is a
che&s;hut which &s;preads its branches be|fore
the whole &s;outh &s;ide of the cha|teau,
and which is &s;o ancient that they
tell me the hollow of its trunk will
hold a dozen men. Your enthu&s;ia&s;m will
&s;carcely contend that there can be either
u&s;e, or beauty, in &s;uch a &s;aple&s;s old tree
as this."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed St. Aubert,
"you &s;urely will not de&s;troy that noble
che&s;nut, which has flouri&s;hed for centuries,
the glory of the e&s;tate! It was in its ma|turity
when the pre&s;ent man&s;ion was
built. How often, in my youth, I have
climbed among its broad branches, and
&s;at embowered amid&s;t a world of leaves,
while the heavy &s;hower has pattered above,
and not a rain drop reached me! How
often I have &s;at with a book in my hand,
&s;ometimes reading, and &s;ometimes look|ing
<PB N="36" REF="38">
out between the branches upon the
wide land&s;cape, and the &s;etting &s;un, till twi|light
came, and brought the birds home
to their little ne&s;ts among the leaves!
How often&mdash;but pardon me," added St.
Aubert, recollecting that he was &s;peaking
to a man who could neither comprehend,
nor allow for his feelings, "I am talking of
times and feelings as old-fa&s;hioned as the
ta&s;te that would &s;pare that venerable tree."</P>
<P>"It will certainly come down," &s;aid
M. Que&s;nel; "I believe I &s;hall plant
&s;ome Lombardy poplars among the
clumps of che&s;nut, that I &s;hall leave of
the avenue; Madame Que&s;nel is partial to
the poplar, and tells me how much it
adorns a villa of her uncle, not far from
Venice."</P>
<P>"On the banks of the Brenta, indeed,"
continued St. Aubert, "where its &s;piry
form is intermingled with the pine, and
the cypre&s;s, and where it plays over light
and elegant porticos and colonnades, it,
unque&s;tionably, adorns the &s;cene; but
<PB N="37" REF="39">
among the giants of the fore&s;t, and near
a heavy gothic man&s;ion&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, my good &s;ir," &s;aid M. Que&s;|nel,
"I will not di&s;pute with you. You
mu&s;t return to Paris before our ideas can&punc;
at all agree. But <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> of Venice; I
have &s;ome thoughts of going thither, next
&s;ummer; events may call me to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that &s;ame villa, too, which they
tell me is the mo&s;t charming that can be
imagined. In that ca&s;e I &s;hall leave the
improvements&punc; I mention to another
year, and I may, perhaps, be tempted to
&s;tay &s;ome time, in Italy."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to hear
him talk of being tempted to remain
abroad, after he had mentioned his pre|&s;ence
to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at Paris, that it
was with difficulty he could &s;teal away
for a month or two; but St. Aubert un|der&s;tood
the &s;elf-importance of the man
too well to wonder at this trait; and the
po&s;&s;ibility, that the&s;e projected improve|ments
might be deferred, gave him
<PB N="38" REF="40">
a hope, that they might never take
place.</P>
<P>Before they &s;eparated for the night, M.
Que&s;nel de&s;ired to &s;peak with St. Aubert
alone, and they retired to another room,
where they remained a con&s;iderable time.
The &s;ubject of this conver&s;ation was not
known; but, whatever it might be, St.
Aubert, when he returned to the &s;upper|room,
&s;eemed much di&s;turbed, and a
&s;hade of &s;orrow &s;ometimes fell upon his
features, that alarmed Madame St. Au|bert.
When they were alone &s;he was
tempted to enquire the occa&s;ion of it,
but the delicacy of mind, which had ever
appeared in his conduct, re&s;trained her:
&s;he con&s;idered that, if St. Aubert wi&s;hed
her to be acquainted with the &s;ubject of his
concern, he would not wait for her enquiries.</P>
<P>On the following day, before M. Que&s;|nel
departed, he had a &s;econd conference
with, St. Aubert.</P>
<P>The gue&s;ts, after dining at &s;he chateau,
&s;et out in the cool of the day for Epourville,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
whither they gave him and Madame St.
Aubert a pre&s;&s;ing invitation, prompted
rather by the vanity of di&s;playing their
&s;plendour, than by a wi&s;h to make their
friends happy.</P>
<P>Emily returned, with delight, to the li|berty
which their pre&s;ence had re&s;train|ed,
to her books, her walks, and the ra|tional
conver&s;ation of M. and Madame St.
Aubert, who &s;eemed to rejoice, no le&s;s,
that they were delivered from the &s;hackles,
which arrogance and frivolity had im|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Madame St. Aubert excu&s;ed her&s;elf
from &s;haring their u&s;ual evening walk,
complaining that &s;he was not quite
well, and St. Aubert and Emily went
out together.</P>
<P>They cho&s;e a walk towards the moun|tains,
intending to vi&s;it &s;ome old pen&s;ioners
of St. Aubert, which, from his very mo|derate
income, he contrived to &s;upport,
though it is probable M. Que&s;nel, with
<PB N="40" REF="42">
his very large one, could not have afforded
this.</P>
<P>After di&s;tributing to his pen&s;ioners
their weekly &s;tipends, li&s;tening patiently
to the complaints of &s;ome, redre&s;&s;ing the
grievances of others, and &s;oftening the
di&s;contents of all, by the look of &s;ympathy,
and the &s;mile of benevolence, St. Aubert
returned home through the woods,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;where</L>
<L>At fall of eve the fairy-people throng,</L>
<L>In various games and revelry to pa&s;s</L>
<L>The &s;ummer night, as village &s;tories tell,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THOMPSON.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>"The evening gloom of woods was
always delightful to me," &s;aid St. Aubert,
who&s;e mind now experienced the &s;weet
calm, which re&s;ults from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of having done a beneficent action, and
which di&s;po&s;es it to receive plea&s;ure from
every &s;urrounding object. "I remember
that in my youth this gloom u&s;ed to call
forth to my fancy a thou&s;and fairy vi&s;ions,
and romantic images; and, I own, I am not
yet wholly in&s;en&s;ible of that high enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
which wakes the poet's dream. I can

&s;hades, &s;end forward a transforming eye
into the di&s;tant ob&s;curity, and li&s;ten with
thrilling delight to the my&s;tic murmuring
of the woods."</P>
<P>"O my dear father," &s;aid Emily, while
a &s;udden tear &s;tarted to her eye, "how
exactly you de&s;cribe what I have felt &s;o
often, and which I thought nobody had
ever felt but my&s;elf! But hark! here
comes the &s;weeping &s;ound over the wood|tops;&mdash;now
it dies away;&mdash;how &s;olemn
the &s;tillne&s;s that &s;ucceeds! Now the
breeze &s;wells again. It is like the
voice of &s;ome &s;upernatural being&mdash;the
voice of the &s;pirit of the woods, that
watches over them by night. Ah! what
light is yonder? But it is gone. And
now it gleams again, near the root of that
large che&s;nut: look, &s;ir!"</P>
<P>"Are you &s;uch an admirer of nature,"
&s;aid St. Aubert, "and &s;o little acquainted
with her appearances as not to know that
<PB N="42" REF="44">
for the glow-worm? But come," added
he gaily, "&s;tep a little further, and we
&s;hall &s;ee fairies, perhaps; they are often
companions. The glow-worm lends his
light, and they in return charm him with
mu&s;ic, and the dance. Do you &s;ee no|thing
tripping yonder?"</P>
<P>Emily laughed. "Well, my dear &s;ir,"
&s;aid &s;he, "&s;ince you allow of this alliance,
I may venture to own I have anticipated
you; and almo&s;t dare venture to repeat
&s;ome ver&s;es I made one evening in the&s;e
very woods."</P>
<P>"Nay," replied St. Aubert, "di&s;mi&s;s
the <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> and venture quite; let us hear
what vagaries fancy has been playing in
your mind. If fhe has given you one of
her &s;pells, you need not envy tho&s;e of the
fairies."</P>
<P>"If it is &s;trong enough to enchant
your judgment, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, "while
I di&s;clo&s;e her images, I need <HI>not</HI> envy
them. The lines go in a &s;ort of trip|ping

<P>St. Aubert continued &s;ilent till he
reached the chateau, where his wife had
retired to her chamber. The languor and
dejection, that had lately oppre&s;&s;ed her,
and which the exertion called forth by the
arrival of her gue&s;ts had &s;u&s;pended, now
returned with increa&s;ed effect. On the fol|lowing
day, &s;ymptoms of fever appeared,
and St. Aubert, having &s;ent for medical
advice, learned, that her di&s;order was a
<PB N="47" REF="49">
fever of the &s;ame nature as that, from
which he had lately recovered. She had,
indeed, taken the infection, during her
attendance upon him, and, her con&s;titu|tion
being too weak to throw out the
di&s;ea&s;e immediately, it had lurked in her
veins, and occa&s;ioned the heavy languor
of which &s;he had complained. St. Au|bert,
who&s;e anxiety for his wife overcame
every other con&s;ideration, detained the
phy&s;ician in his hou&s;e. He remembered
the feelings and the reflections that had
called a momentary gloom upon his mind,
on the day when he had la&s;t vi&s;ited the
fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, in company with Madame
St. Aubert, and he now admitted a pre|&s;entiment,
that this illne&s;s would be a
fatal one. But he effectually concealed
this from her, and from his daughter,
whom he endeavoured to re-animate wit
hopes that her con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduities woul
not be unavailing. The phy&s;ician, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
a&s;ked by St. Aubert for his opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">
the di&s;order, replied, that the event of
<PB N="48" REF="50">
depended upon circum&s;tances which he
could not a&s;certain. Madame St. Aubert
&s;eemed to have formed a more decided
one; but her eyes only gave hints of
this. She frequently fixed them upon
her anxious friends with an expre&s;&s;ion
of pity, and of tenderne&s;s, as if &s;he an|ticipated
the &s;orrow that awaited them,
and that &s;eemed to &s;ay, it was for their
&s;akes only, for their &s;ufferings, that &s;he
regretted life. On the &s;eventh day, the
di&s;order was at its cri&s;is. The phy&s;ician
a&s;&s;umed a graver manner, which &s;he ob|&s;erved,
and took occa&s;ion, when her
family had once quitted the chamber, to
tell him, that &s;he perceived her death was
approaching. "Do not attempt to de|ceive
me," &s;aid &s;he, "I feel that I can|not
long &s;urvive. I am prepared for
the event, I have long, I hope, been pre|paring
for it. Since I have not long
to live, do not &s;uffer a mi&s;taken com|pa&s;&s;ion
to induce you to flatter my
family with fal&s;e hopes, If you do, their
<PB N="49" REF="51">
affliction will only be the heavier when it
arrives: I will endeavour to teach them re|&s;ignation
by my example."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician was affected; he pro|mi&s;ed
to obey her, and told St. Aubert, &s;ome|what
abruptly, that there was nothing to
expect. The latter was not philo&s;opher
enough to re&s;train his feelings when he re|ceived
this information; but a con&s;ideration
of the increa&s;ed affliction which the ob&s;er|vance
of his grief would occa&s;ion his wife,
enabled him, after &s;ome time, to command
him&s;elf in her pre&s;ence. Emily was at fir&s;t
overwhelmed with the intelligence; then,
deluded by the &s;trength of her wi&s;hes, a
hope &s;prung up in her mind that her mother
would yet recover, and to this &s;he perti|naciou&s;ly
adhered almo&s;t to the la&s;t hour.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of this di&s;order was marked,
on the &s;ide of Madame St. Aubert, by
patient &s;uffering, and &s;ubjected wi&s;hes. The
compo&s;ure, with which &s;he awaited her
death, could be derived only from the re|tro&s;pect
of a life governed, as far as human
<PB N="50" REF="52">
frailty permits, by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being
always in the pre&s;ence of the Deity, and by
the hope of an higher world. But her piety
could not entirely &s;ubdue the grief of part|ing
from tho&s;e whom &s;he &s;o dearly loved.
During the&s;e her la&s;t hours, &s;he conver&s;ed
much with St. Aubert and Emily, on the
pro&s;pect of futurity, and on other religious
topics. The re&s;ignation &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, with
the firm hope of meeting in a future world
the friends &s;he left in this, and the effort
which &s;ometimes appeared to conceal her &s;or|row
at this temporary &s;eparation, frequent|ly
affected St. Aubert &s;o much as to oblige
him to leave the room. Having indulged
his tears awhile, he would dry them and
return to the chamber with a countenance
compo&s;ed by an endeavour which did but
increa&s;e his grief.</P>
<P>Never had Emily felt the importance of
the le&s;&s;ons, which had taught her to re&s;train
her &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o much as in the&s;e moments,
and never had &s;he practi&s;ed them with a
triumph &s;o complete. But when the la&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="53">
was over, &s;he &s;unk at once under the pre&s;&s;ure
of her &s;orrow, and then perceived that it was
hope, as well as fortitude, which had hither|to
&s;upported her. St. Aubert was for a time
too devoid of comfort him&s;elf to be&s;tow any
on his daughter.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MADAME St. Aubert was interred in
the neighbouring village church; her hu&s;|band
and daughter attended her to the
grave, followed by a long train of the pea|&s;antry,
who were &s;incere mourners of this
excellent woman.</P>
<P>On his return from the funeral, St. Aubert
&s;hut him&s;elf in his chamber. When he
came forth, it was with a &s;erene countenance,
though pale in &s;orrow. He gave orders that
his family &s;hould attend him. Emily only
was ab&s;ent; who, overcome with the &s;cene
&s;he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, had retired to her
clo&s;et to weep alone. St. Aubert followed her
thither: he took her hand in &s;ilence, while &s;he
continued to weep; and it was &s;ome moments
before he could &s;o far command his voice as
to &s;peak. It trembled while he &s;aid, "My
<PB N="53" REF="55">
Emily, I am going to prayers with my fa|mily;
you will join us. We mu&s;t a&s;k &s;up|port
from above. Where el&s;e ought we to
&s;eek it&mdash;where el&s;e can we find it?"</P>
<P>Emily checked her tears, and followed
her father to the parlour, where, the &s;ervants
being a&s;&s;embled, St. Aubert read, in a low
and &s;olemn voice, the evening &s;ervice, and
added a prayer for the &s;oul of the departed.
During this, his voice often faltered, his
tears fell upon the book, and at length he
pau&s;ed. But the &s;ublime emotions of pure
devotion gradually elevated his views above
this world, and finally brought comfort to
his heart.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice was ended, and the &s;er|vants
were withdrawn, he tenderly ki&s;&s;ed
Emily, and &s;aid, "I have endeavoured to
teach you, from your earlie&s;t youth, the duty
of &s;elf-command; I have pointed out to you
the great importance of it through life,
not only as it pre&s;erves us in the various
and dangerous temptations that call us from
rectitude and virtue, but as it limits the
<PB N="54" REF="56">
indulgences which are termed virtuous, yet
which, extended beyond a certain boundary,
are vicious, for their con&s;equence is evil.
All exce&s;s is vicious; even that &s;orrow, which
is amiable in its origin, becomes a &s;elfi&s;h and
unju&s;t, pa&s;&s;ion, if indulged at the expence of
our duties&mdash;by our duties I mean what we
owe to our&s;elves, as well as to others. The
indulgence of exce&s;&s;ive grief enervates the
mind, and almo&s;t incapacitates it for again
partaking of tho&s;e various innocent enjoy|ments
which a benevolent God de&s;igned to
be the &s;un-&s;hine of our lives. My dear
Emily, recollect and practi&s;e the precepts I
have &s;o often given you, and which your
own experience has &s;o often &s;hewn you to
be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>"Your &s;orrow is u&s;ele&s;s. Do not receive
this as merely a common-place remark, but
let rea&s;on <HI>therefore</HI> re&s;train &s;orrow. I would
not annihilate your feelings, my child, I
would only teach you to command them;
for whatever may be the evils re&s;ulting from
a too &s;u&s;ceptible heart, nothing can be hoped
<PB N="55" REF="57">
from an in&s;en&s;ible one; that, on the other
hand, is all vice&mdash;vice, of which the de|formity
is not &s;oftened, or the effect con|&s;oled
for, by any &s;emblance or po&s;&s;ibility
of good. You know my &s;ufferings, and
are, therefore, convinced that mine are not
the light words which, on the&s;e occa&s;ions,
are &s;o often repeated to de&s;troy even the
&s;ources of hone&s;t emotion, or which merely
di&s;play the &s;elfi&s;h o&s;tentation of a fal&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy.
I will &s;hew my Emily, that I can
practi&s;e what I advi&s;e. I have &s;aid thus
much, becau&s;e I cannot bear to &s;ee you wa&s;t|ing
in u&s;ele&s;s &s;orrow, for want of that re&s;i&s;t|ance
which is due from mind; and I have
not &s;aid, it till now, becau&s;e there is a period
when all rea&s;oning mu&s;t yield to nature;
that is pa&s;t: and another, when exce&s;&s;ive in|dulgence,
having &s;unk into habit, weighs
down the ela&s;ticity of the &s;pirits &s;o as to
render conque&s;t nearly impo&s;&s;ible; this is
to come. You, my Emily, will &s;hew that
you are willing to avoid it."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled through her tears upon her
<PB N="56" REF="58">
father: "Dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he, and her voice
trembled; &s;he would have added, "I will
&s;hew my&s;elf worthy of being your daugh|ter;"
but a mingled emotion of gratitude,
affection, and grief overcame her. St.
Aubert &s;uffered her to weep without inter|ruption,
and then began to talk on com|mon
topics.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on who came to condole
with St. Aubert was an M. Barreaux, an
au&s;tere and &s;eemingly unfeeling man. A
ta&s;te for botany had introduced them to each
other, for they had frequently met in their
wanderings among the mountains. M. Bar|reaux
had retired from the world, and almo&s;t
from &s;ociety, to live in a plea&s;ant chateau,
on the &s;kirts of the woods, near La Vall&eacute;e.
He al&s;o had been di&s;appointed in his opi|nion
of mankind; but he did not, like St.
Aubert, pity and mourn for them; he felt
more indignation at their vices, than com|pa&s;&s;ion
for their weakne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee
him; for, though he had often pre&s;&s;ed him
<PB N="57" REF="59">
to come to the chateau, he had never till
now accepted the invitation; and now he
came without ceremony or re&s;erve, entering
the parlour as an old friend. The claims
of misfortune appeared to have &s;oftened
down all the ruggedne&s;s and prejudices of
his heart. St. Aubert unhappy, &s;eemed to
be the &s;ole idea that occupied his mind. It
was in manners, more than in words, that he
appeared to &s;ympathize with his friends: he
&s;poke little on the &s;ubject of their grief; but
the minute attention he gave them, and the
modulated voice, and &s;oftened look that
accompanied it, came from his heart, and
&s;poke to theirs.</P>
<P>At this melancholy period, St. Aubert
was likewi&s;e vi&s;ited by Madame Cheron, his
only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ome
years a widow, and now re&s;ided on her own
e&s;tate near Tholou&s;e. The intercour&s;e be|tween
them had not been very frequent. In
her condolements, words were not wanting;
&s;he under&s;tood not the magic of the look
that &s;peaks at once to the &s;oul, or the voice
<PB N="58" REF="60">
that &s;inks like balm to the heart: but &s;he
a&s;&s;ured St. Aubert that &s;he &s;incerely &s;ym|pathized
with him, prai&s;ed the virtues of
his late wife, and then offered what &s;he con|&s;idered
to be con&s;olation. Emily wept un|cea&s;ingly
while &s;he &s;poke; St. Aubert was
tranquil, li&s;tened to what &s;he &s;aid in &s;ilence,
and then turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon another
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>At parting &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him and her niece
to make her an early vi&s;it. "Change of
place will amu&s;e you," &s;aid &s;he, "and it is
wrong to give way to grief." St. Aubert
acknowledged the truth of the&s;e words of
cour&s;e; but, at the &s;ame time, felt more
reluctant than ever to quit the &s;pot which
his pa&s;t happine&s;s had con&s;ecrated. The
pre&s;ence of his wife had &s;anctified every &s;ur|rounding
&s;cene, and, each day, as it gra|dually
&s;oftened the acutene&s;s of his &s;uffer|ing,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted the tender enchantment that
bound him to home.</P>
<P>But there were calls which mu&s;t be com|plied
with, and of this kind was the vi&s;it he
<PB N="59" REF="61">
paid to his brother-in-law M. Que&s;nel. An
affair of an intere&s;ting nature made it nece&s;|&s;ary
that he &s;hould delay this vi&s;it no longer,
and, wi&s;hing to rou&s;e Emily from her dejec|tion,
he took her with him to Epourville.</P>
<P>As the carriage entered upon the fore&s;t
that adjoined his paternal domain, his eyes
once more caught, between the che&s;nut
avenue, the turreted corners of the chateau.
He &s;ighed to think of what had pa&s;&s;ed
&s;ince he was la&s;t there, and that it was now
the property of a man who neither revered
nor valued it. At length he entered the
avenue, who&s;e lofty trees had &s;o often de|lighted
him when a boy, and who&s;e melan|choly
&s;hade was now &s;o congenial with the
tone of his &s;pirits. Every feature of the edifice,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by an air of heavy grandeur,
appeared &s;ucce&s;&s;ively between the branches
of the trees&mdash;the broad turret, the arched
gate-way that led into the courts, the draw|bridge,
and the dry fo&s;&s;e which &s;urrounded
the whole.</P>
<P>The found of carriage wheels brought a
<PB N="60" REF="62">
troop of &s;ervants to the great gate, where St.
Aubert alighted, and from which he led
Emily into the gothic halsl, now no longer
hung with the arms and ancient banners of
the family. The&s;e were di&s;placed, and the
oak wain&s;cotting, and beams that cro&s;&s;ed the
roof, were painted white. The large table,
too, that u&s;ed to &s;tretch along the upper
end of the hall, where the ma&s;ter of the
man&s;ion loved to di&s;play his ho&s;pitality, and
whence the peal of laughter, and the &s;ong of
conviviality, had &s;o often re&s;ounded, was
now removed; even the benches that had
&s;urrounded the hall were no longer there.
The heavy walls were hung with frivolous
ornaments, and every thing that appeared
denoted the fal&s;e ta&s;te and corrupted &s;enti|ments
of the pre&s;ent owner.</P>
<P>St. Aubert followed a gay Pari&s;ian &s;ervant
to a parlour, where sat Mon&s;. and Madame
Que&s;nel, who received him with a &s;tately
politene&s;s, and, after a few formal words of
condolement, &s;eemed to have forgotten that
they ever had a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">
Emily felt tears &s;well into her eyes, and
then re&s;entment checked them. St. Aubert,
calm and deliberate, pre&s;erved his dig|nity
without a&s;&s;uming importance, and
Que&s;nel was depre&s;&s;ed by his pre&s;ence
without exactly knowing wherefore.</P>
<P>After &s;ome general conversation, St. Aubert
reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him alone; and
Emily, being left with Madame Que&s;nel,
&s;oon learned that a large party was invited
to dine at the chateau, and was compelled
to hear that nothing which was pa&s;t and ir|remediable
ought to prevent the fe&s;tivity of
the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, when he was told that com|pany
were expected, felt a mixed emotion
of di&s;gu&s;t and indignation again&s;t the in&s;en|&s;ibility
of Que&s;nel, which prompted him to
return home immediately. But he was in|formed,
that Madame Cheron had been a&s;k|ed
to meet him; and, when he looked at
Emily, and con&s;idered that a time might
come when the enmity of her uncle would
be prejudicial to her, he determined not to
<PB N="62" REF="64">
incur it him&s;elf, by conduct which would be
re&s;ented as indecorous, by the very per&s;ons
who now &s;hewed &s;o little &s;en&s;e of decorum.</P>
<P>Among the vi&s;itors a&s;&s;embled at dinner
were two Italian gentlemen, of whom one
was named Montoni, a di&s;tant relation of
Madame Que&s;nel, a man about forty, of an
uncommonly hand&s;ome per&s;on, with fea|tures
manly and expre&s;&s;ive, but who&s;e coun|tenance
exhibited, upon the whole, more of
the haughtine&s;s of command, and the quick|ne&s;s
of discernment, than of any other cha|racter.</P>
<P>Signor Cavigni, his friend, appeared to
be about thirty&mdash;his inferior indignity, but
equal to him in penetration of countenance,
and &s;uperior in in&s;inuation of manner.</P>
<P>Emily was &s;hocked by the &s;alutation with
which Madame Cheron met her father&mdash;"Dear
brother," &s;aid &s;he, "I am concerned
to &s;ee you look &s;o very ill; do, pray, have
advice!" St. Aubert an&s;wered, with a me|lancholy
&s;mile, that he felt him&s;elf much as
u&s;ual; but Emily's fears made her now fancy
<PB N="63" REF="65">
that her father looked wor&s;e than he really
did.</P>
<P>Emily would have been amu&s;ed by the
new characters &s;he &s;aw, and the varied
conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed during dinner,
which was &s;erved in a &s;tyle of &s;plen|dour
&s;he had &s;eldom &s;een before, had her
&s;pirits been le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed. Of the gue&s;ts,
Signor Montoni was lately come from
Italy, and he &s;poke of the commotions
which at that period agitated the country;
talked of party differences with warmth, and
then lamented the probable con&s;equences
of the tumults. His friend &s;poke with
equal ardour, of the politics of his country;
prai&s;ed the government and pro&s;perity of
Venice, and boa&s;ted of its decided &s;uperio|rity
over all the other Italian &s;tates. He
then turned to the ladies, and talked with
the &s;ame eloquence, of Pari&s;ian fa&s;hions, the
French opera, and French manners; and on
the latter &s;ubject he did not fail to mingle
what is &s;o particularly agreeable to French
ta&s;te. The flattery was not detected by
<PB N="64" REF="66">
tho&s;e to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, though its
effect, in producing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive attention, did
not e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation. When he could
di&s;engage him&s;elf from the a&s;&s;iduities of the
other ladies, he &s;ometimes addre&s;&s;ed Emily:
but &s;he knew nothing of Pari&s;ian fa&s;hions,
or Pari&s;ian operas; and her mode&s;ty, &s;impli|city,
and correct manners formed a decided
contra&s;t to tho&s;e of her female companions.</P>
<P>After dinner, St. Aubert &s;tole from the
room to view once more the old che&s;nut
which Que&s;nel talked of cutting down. As
he &s;tood under its &s;hade, and looked up
among its branches, &s;till luxuriant, and &s;aw
here and there the blue &s;ky trembling be|tween
them; the pur&s;uits and events of his
early days crowded fa&s;t to his mind, with
the figures and characters of friends&mdash;long
&s;ince gone from the earth; and he now felt
him&s;elf to be almo&s;t an in&s;ulated being,
with nobody but his Emily for his heart to
turn to.</P>
<P>He &s;tood lo&s;t amid the &s;cenes of years
which fancy called up, till the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="65" REF="67">
clo&s;ed with the picture of his dying wife,
and he &s;tarted away, to forget it, if po&s;&s;ible,
at the &s;ocial board.</P>
<P>St. Aubert ordered his carriage at an early
hour, and Emily ob&s;erved, that he was more
than unu&s;ually &s;ilent and dejected on the way
home; but &s;he con&s;idered this to be the
effect of his vi&s;it to a place which &s;poke &s;o
eloquently of former times, nor &s;u&s;pected
that he had a cau&s;e of grief which he con|cealed
from her.</P>
<P>On entering the chateau &s;he felt more
depre&s;&s;ed than ever, for &s;he more than ever
mi&s;&s;ed the pre&s;ence of that dear parent, who,
whenever &s;he had been from home, u&s;ed to
welcome her return with &s;miles and fond|ne&s;s;
now, all was &s;ilent and for&s;aken.</P>
<P>But what rea&s;on and effort may fail to
do, time effects. Week after week pa&s;&s;ed
away, and each, as it pa&s;&s;ed, &s;tole &s;omething
from the har&s;hne&s;s of her affliction, till it was
mellowed to that tenderne&s;s which the feel|ing
heart cheri&s;hes as &s;acred. St. Aubert,
on the contrary, vi&s;ibly declined in health;
<PB N="66" REF="68">
though Emily, who had been &s;o constantly
with him, was almo&s;t the la&s;t per&s;on who ob|&s;erved
it. His con&s;titution had never reco|vered
from the late attack of the fever, and
the &s;ucceeding &s;hock it had received from
Madame St. Aubert's death had produced
its pre&s;ent infirmity. His phy&s;ician now
ordered him to travel; for it was percepti|ble
that &s;orrow had &s;eized upon his nerves,
weakened as they had been by the preced|ing
illne&s;s; and variety of &s;cene, it was pro|bable,
would, by amu&s;ing his mind, re&s;tore
them to their proper tone.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days Emily was occupied in
preparations to attend him; and he, by
endeavours to dimini&s;h his expences at
home during the journey&mdash;a purpo&s;e which
determined him at length to di&s;mi&s;s his do|me&s;tics.
Emily &s;eldom oppo&s;ed her father's
wi&s;hes by que&s;tions or remon&s;trances, or
&s;he would now have a&s;ked why he did not
take a &s;ervant, and have repre&s;ented that his
infirm health made one almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.
But when, on the eve of their departure, &s;he
<PB N="67" REF="69">
found that he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Jacques, Fran|cis,
and Mary, and detained only There&s;a
the old hou&s;ekeeper, &s;he was extremely &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
and ventured to a&s;k his rea&s;on for
having done &s;o. "To &s;ave expences, my
dear," he replied&mdash;"we are going on an
expen&s;ive excur&s;ion."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician had pre&s;cribed the air of
Languedoc and Provence; and St. Aubert
determined, therefore, to travel lei&s;urely
along the &s;hores of the Mediterranean, to|wards
Provence.</P>
<P>They retired early to their chamber on
the night before their departure; but Emily
had a few books and other things to col|lect,
and the clock had &s;truck twelve before
&s;he had fini&s;hed, or had remembered that
&s;ome of her drawing in&s;truments, which &s;he
meant to take with her, were in the par|lour
below. As &s;he went to fetch the&s;e,
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed her father's room, and, perceiv|ing
the door half open, concluded that he
was in his &s;tudy&mdash;for, &s;ince the death of
Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently
<PB N="68" REF="70">
his cu&s;tom to ri&s;e from his re&s;tle&s;s bed, and
go thither to compo&s;e his mind. When &s;he
was below &s;tairs &s;he looked into this room,
but without finding him; and as &s;he returned
to her chamber, &s;he tapped at his door, and
receiving no an&s;wer, &s;tepped &s;oftly in, to be
certain whether he was there.</P>
<P>The room was dark, but a light glim|mered
through &s;ome panes of gla&s;s that
were placed in the upper part of a clo&s;et|door.
Emily believed her father to be in
the clo&s;et, and, &s;urpri&s;ed that he was up at
&s;o late an hour, apprehended he was unwell,
and was going to enquire; but, con&s;idering
that her &s;udden appearance at this hour
might alarm him, &s;he removed her light to
the &s;tair-cafe, and then &s;tepped &s;oftly to the
clo&s;et. On looking through the panes of
gla&s;s, &s;he &s;aw him &s;eated at a &s;mall table, with
papers before him, &s;ome of which he was
reading with deep attention and intere&s;t,
during which he often wept, and &s;obbed
aloud. Emily, who had come to the door
to learn whether her father was ill, was
<PB N="69" REF="71">
now detained there by a mixture of curio&s;ity
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nd tenderne&s;s. She could not witne&s;s his
sorrow, without being anxious to know the
subject of it; and &s;he therefore continued
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">o ob&s;erve him in &s;ilence, concluding that
tho&s;e papers were letters of her late mo|ther.
Pre&s;ently he knelt down, and with
look &s;o &s;olemn as &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een him
a&s;&s;ume, and which was mingled with a cer|tain
wild expre&s;&s;ion, that partook more of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">orror than of any other character, he pray|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">d
&s;ilently for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>When he ro&s;e, a gha&s;tly palene&s;s was on
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">is countenance. Emily was ha&s;tily retir|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">g;
but &s;he &s;aw him turn again to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">apers, and &s;he &s;topped. He took from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">mong them a &s;mall ca&s;e, and from thence
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> miniature picture. The rays of light fell
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rongly upon it, and &s;he perceived it to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">at of a lady, but not of her mother.</P>
<P>St. Aubert gazed earne&s;tly and tenderly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">pon this portrait, put it to his lips, and then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> his heart, and &s;ighed with a convul&s;ive
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">rce. Emily could &s;carcely believe what
<PB N="70" REF="72">
&s;he &s;aw to be real. She never knew till now
that he had a picture of any other lady than
her mother, much le&s;s that he had one which
he evidently valued &s;o highly; but having
looked repeatedly, to be certain that it was
not the re&s;emblance of Madame St. Au|bert,
&s;he became entirely convinced that
it was de&s;igned for that of &s;ome other
per&s;on.</P>
<P>At length St. Aubert returned the pic|ture
into its ca&s;e; and Emily, recollecting
that &s;he was intruding upon his private &s;or|rows,
&s;oftly withdrew from the chamber.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. Aubert, in&s;tead of taking the more
direct road, that ran along the feet of the
Pyren&eacute;es to Languedoc, cho&s;e one that,
winding over the heights, afforded more ex|ten&s;ive
views and greater variety of romantic
&s;cenery. He turned a little out of his way
to take leave of M. Barreaux, whom he
found botanizing in the wood near his cha|teau,
and who, when he was told the purpo&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="74">
of St. Aubert's vi&s;it, expre&s;&s;ed a degree of
concern, &s;uch as his friend had thought it
was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for him to feel on any
&s;imilar occa&s;ion. They parted with mutual
regret.</P>
<P>"If any thing could have tempted me
from my retirement," &s;aid M. Barreaux, "it
would have been the plea&s;ure of accompa|nying
you on this little tour. I do not often
offer compliments; you may, therefore, be|lieve
me, when I &s;ay, that I &s;hall look for
your return with impatience."</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded on their journey.
As they a&s;cended the heights, St. Aubert
often looked back upon his chateau, in the
plain below; tender images crowded to his
mind; his melancholy imagination &s;ug|ge&s;ted
that he &s;hould return no more; and
though he checked this wandering thought,
&s;till he continued to look, till the hazine&s;s
of di&s;tance blended his home with the gene|ral
land&s;cape, and St. Aubert &s;eemed to
"Drag at each remove a lengthening chain."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">
He and Emily continued &s;unk in mu&s;ing
&s;ilence for &s;ome leagues, from which melan|choly
reverie Emily fir&s;t awoke, and her
young fancy, &s;truck with the grandeur of
the objects around, gradually yielded to de|lightful
impre&s;&s;ions. The road now de|&s;cended
into glens, confined by &s;tupendous
walls of rock, grey and barren, except
where &s;hrubs fringed their &s;ummits, or
patches of meagre vegetation tinted their
rece&s;&s;es, in which the wild goat was fre|quently
brow&s;ing. And now, the way led
to the lofty cliffs, from whence the land&s;cape
was &s;een extending in all its magnificence.</P>
<P>Emily could not re&s;train her tran&s;port as
&s;he looked over the pine fore&s;ts of the moun|tains
upon the va&s;t plains, that, enriched with
woods, towns, blu&s;hing vines, and planta|tions
of almonds, palms and olives, &s;tretched
along, till their various colours melted in
di&s;tance into one harmonious hue, that
&s;eemed to unite earth with heaven. Through
the whole of this glorious &s;cene the maje&s;tic
Garonne wandered; de&s;cending from its
<PB N="74" REF="76">
&s;ource among the Pyren&eacute;es, and winding its
blue waves towards the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>The ruggedne&s;s of the unfrequented road
often obliged the wanderers to alight from
their little carriage, but they thought them|&s;elves
amply repaid for this inconvenience
by the grandeur of the &s;cenes; and, while
the muleteer led his animals &s;lowly over the
broken ground, the travellers had lei&s;ure to
linger and the&s;e &s;olitudes, and to indulge
the &s;ublime reflections, which &s;often, while
they elevate, the heart, and fill it with the
certainty of a pre&s;ent God! Still the enjoy|ment
of St. Aubert was touched with that
pen&s;ive melancholy, which gives to every
object a mellower tint, and breathes a &s;acred
charm over all around.</P>
<P>They had provided again&s;t part of
the evil to be encountered from a want
of convenient inns, by carrying a &s;tock of
provi&s;ions in the carriage, &s;o that they
might take refre&s;hment on any plea&s;ant &s;pot,
in the open air, and pa&s;s the nights where|ever
they &s;hould happen to meet with a
<PB N="75" REF="77">
comfortable cottage. For the mind, al&s;o,
they had provided, by a work on botany,
written by M. Barreaux, and by &s;everal of
the Latin and Italian poets; while Emily's
pencil enabled her to pre&s;erve &s;ome of
tho&s;e combinations of forms, which charm|ed
her at every &s;tep.</P>
<P>The loneline&s;s of the road, where, only
now and then, a pea&s;ant was &s;een driving his
mule, or &s;ome mountaineer-children at play
among the rocks, heightened the effect of
the &s;cenery. St. Aubert was &s;o much &s;truck
with it, that he determined, if he could
hear of a road, to penetrate further among
the mountains, and, bending his way rather
more to the &s;outh, to emerge into Rou&s;illon,
and coa&s;t the Mediterranean along part of
that country to Languedoc.</P>
<P>Soon after mid-day, they reached the
&s;ummit of one of tho&s;e cliffs, which, bright
with the verdure of palm trees, adorn,
like gems, the tremendous walls of the
rocks, and which overlooked the greater
part of Ga&s;cony, and part of Languedoc.
<PB N="76" REF="78">
Here was &s;hade, and the fre&s;h water of a
&s;pring, that, gliding among the turf, under
the trees, thence precipitated it&s;elf from
rock to rock, till its da&s;hing murmurs were
lo&s;t in the aby&s;s, though its white foam
was long &s;een amid the darkne&s;s of the
pines below.</P>
<P>This was a &s;pot well &s;uited for re&s;t, and
the travellers alighted to dine, while the
mules were unharne&s;&s;ed to brow&s;e on the
&s;avoury herbs that enriched this &s;ummit.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before St. Aubert or
Emily could withdraw their attention from
the &s;urrounding objects, &s;o as to partake of
their little repa&s;t. Seated in the &s;hade of
the palms, St. Aubert pointed out to her
ob&s;ervation the cour&s;e of the rivers, the &s;itua|tion
of great towns, and the boundaries of
provinces, which &s;cience, rather than the eye,
enabled him to de&s;cribe. Notwith&s;tanding
this occupation, when he had talked awhile
he &s;uddenly became &s;ilent, thoughtful, and
tears often &s;welled to his eyes, which Emily
ob&s;erved, and the &s;ympathy of her own
<PB N="77" REF="79">
heart told her their cau&s;e. The &s;cene
before them bore &s;ome re&s;emblance, though
it was on a much grander &s;cale, to a fa|vourite
one of the late Madame St. Aubert,
within view of the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e. They
both ob&s;erved this, and thought how de|lighted
&s;he would have been with the pre|&s;ent
land&s;cape, while they knew that her eyes
mu&s;t never, never more open upon this
world. St. Aubert remembered the la&s;t
time of his vi&s;iting that &s;pot in company
with her, and al&s;o the mournfully pre&s;aging
thoughts which had then ari&s;en in his mind,
and were now, even thus &s;oon, realized!
The recollections &s;ubdued him, and he
abruptly ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and walked
away to where no eye could ob&s;erve his grief.</P>
<P>When he returned, his countenance had
recovered its u&s;ual &s;erenity; he took Emi|ly's
hand, pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately, without
&s;peaking, and &s;oon after called to the mu|leteer,
who &s;at at a little di&s;tance, concern|ing
a road among the mountains towards
<PB N="78" REF="80">
Rou&s;illon. Michael &s;aid, there were &s;everal
that way, but he did not know how far they
extended, or even whether they were pa&s;&s;|able;
and St. Aubert, who did not intend
to travel after &s;un &s;et, a&s;ked what village
they could reach about that time. The mule|teer
calculated, that they could ea&s;ily reach
Mateau, which was in their pre&s;ent road; but
that, if they took a road that &s;loped more to
the &s;outh, towards Rou&s;illon, there was a
hamlet, which he thought they could gain
before the evening &s;hut in.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, after &s;ome he&s;itation, deter|mined
to take the latter cour&s;e, and Michael,
having fini&s;hed his meal, and harne&s;&s;ed his
mules, again &s;et forward, but &s;oon &s;topped;
and St. Aubert &s;aw him doing homage to a
cro&s;s, that &s;tood on a rock impending over
their way. Having concluded his devo|tions,
he &s;macked his whip in the air, and,
in &s;pite of the rough road, and the pain of his
poor mules, which he had been lately lament|ing,
rattled, in a full gallop, along the edge
of a precipice, which it made the eye dizzy
<PB N="79" REF="81">
to look down. Emily was terrified almo&s;t
to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending
&s;till greater danger from &s;uddenly &s;topping
the driver, was compelled to &s;it quietly, and
tru&s;t his fate to the &s;trength and di&s;cretion
of the mules, who &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater
portion of the latter quality than their ma&s;|ter;
for they carried the travellers &s;afely in|to
the valley, and there &s;topped upon the
brink of the rivulet that watered it.</P>
<P>Leaving the &s;plendour of exten&s;ive pro|&s;pects,
they now entered this narrow valley
&s;creened by</P>
<Q><L>Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic &s;pell,</L>
<L>Here &s;corch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;cene of barrenne&s;s was here and
there interrupted by the &s;preading branches
of the larch and cedar, which threw their
gloom over the cliff, or a hwart the torrent
that rolled in the vale. No living creature
appeared, except the izard, &s;crambling
among the rocks, and often hanging upon
points &s;o dangerous, that fancy &s;hrunk from
<PB N="80" REF="82">
the view of them. This was &s;uch a &s;cene
as <HI>Salvator</HI> would have cho&s;en, had he then
exi&s;ted, for his canva&s;s; St. Aubert, im|pre&s;&s;ed
by the romantic character of the
place, almo&s;t expected to &s;ee banditti &s;tart
from behind &s;ome projecting rock, and be
kept his hand upon the arms with which
he always travelled.</P>
<P>As they advanced, the valley opened; its
&s;avage features gradually &s;oftened, and, to|wards
evening, they were among heathy
mountains, &s;tretched in far per&s;pective,
along which the &s;olitary &s;heep-bell was
heard, and the voice of the &s;hepherd calling
his wandering flocks to the nightly fold.
His cabin, partly &s;hadowed by the cork-tree
and the ilex, which St. Aubert ob&s;erved to
flouri&s;h in higher regions of the air than any
other trees, except the fir, was all the hu|man
habitation that yet appeared. Along
the bottom of this valley the mo&s;t vivid
verdure was &s;pread; and, in the little hol|low
rece&s;&s;es of the mountains, under the
&s;hade of the oak and che&s;nut, herds of cat|tle
<PB N="81" REF="83">
were grazing. Groups of them, too,
were often &s;een repo&s;ing on the banks of
the rivulet, or laving their &s;ides in the
cool &s;tream, and &s;ipping its wave.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now &s;etting upon the val|ley;
its la&s;t light gleamed upon the water,
and heightened the rich yellow and purple
tints of the heath and broom, that over|&s;pread
the mountains. St. Aubert enquired
of Michael the di&s;tance to the hamlet he had
mentioned, but the man could not with cer|tainty
tell; and Emily began to fear that
he had mi&s;taken the road. Here was no
human being to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or direct them; they
had left the &s;hepherd and his cabin far be|hind,
and the &s;cene became &s;o ob&s;cured in
twilight, that the eye could not follow the
di&s;tant per&s;pective of the valley in &s;earch of a
cottage or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon
&s;till marked the we&s;t, and this was of &s;ome
little use to the travellers. Michael &s;eemed en|deavouring
to keep up his courage by &s;ing|ing;
his mu&s;ic, however, was not of a kind
to di&s;per&s;e melancholy; he &s;ung, in a &s;ort of
<PB N="82" REF="84">
chant, one of the mo&s;t di&s;mal ditties his
pre&s;ent auditors had ever heard, and St.
Aubert at length di&s;covered it to be a ve&s;|per-hymn
to his favourite &s;aint.</P>
<P>They travelled on, &s;unk in that thoughtful
melancholy, with which twilight and &s;olitude
impre&s;s the mind. Michael had now ended
his ditty, and nothing was heard but the
drow&s;y murmur of the breeze among the
woods, and its light flutter, as it blew fre&s;h|ly
into the carriage. They were at length
rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of fire-arms. St. Au|bert
called to the muleteer to &s;top, and
they li&s;tened. The noi&s;e was not repeated;
but pre&s;ently they heard a ru&s;tling among
the brakes. St. Aubert drew forth a pi&s;tol,
and ordered Michael to proceed as fa&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible; who had not long obeyed, before
a horn &s;ounded, that made the mountains
ring. He looked again from the window,
and then &s;aw a young man &s;pring from the
bu&s;hes into the road, followed by a couple
of dogs. The &s;tranger was in a hunter's
dre&s;s. His gun was &s;lung acro&s;s his &s;houl|ders,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
the hunter's horn hung from his belt,
and in his hand was a &s;mall pike, which, as
he held it, added to the manly grace of his
figure, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the agility of his &s;teps.</P>
<P>After a moment's he&s;itation, St. Aubert
again &s;topped the carriage, and waited till
he came up, that they might enquire con|cerning
the hamlet they were in &s;earch of.
The &s;tranger informed him, that it was on|ly
half a league di&s;tant, that he was going
thither him&s;elf, and would readily &s;hew the
way. St. Aubert thanked him for the of|fer,
and, plea&s;ed with his chevalier-like air
and open countenance, a&s;ked him to take a
&s;eat in the carriage; which the &s;tranger, with
an acknowledgment, declined, adding that
he would keep pace with the mules. "But
I fear you will be wretchedly accommo|dated,"
&s;aid he: "the inhabitants of the&s;e
mountains are a &s;imple people, who are not
only without the luxuries of life, but al|mo&s;t
de&s;titute of what in other places are
held to be its nece&s;&s;aries."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">
"I perceive you are not one of its inha|bitants,
&s;ir," &s;aid St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir, I am only a wanderer here."</P>
<P>The carriage drove on, and the increa&s;ing
du&s;k made the travellers very thankful that
they had a guide; the frequent glens, too,
that now opened among the mountains, would
likewi&s;e have added to their perplexity. Emi|ly,
as &s;he looked up one of the&s;e, &s;aw &s;ome|thing
at a great di&s;tance like a bright cloud
in the air. "What light is yonder, &s;ir?"
&s;aid &s;he. St. Aubert looked, and perceived
that it was the &s;nowy &s;ummit of a mountain,
&s;o much higher than any around it, that it
&s;till reflected the &s;un's rays, while tho&s;e be|low
lay in deep &s;hade.</P>
<P>At length, village lights were &s;een to
twinkle through the du&s;k, and, &s;oon after,
&s;ome cottages were di&s;covered in the valley,
or rather were &s;een by reflection in the &s;tream,
on who&s;e margin they &s;tood, and which &s;till
gleamed with the evening light.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger now came up, and St. Au|bert,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
on further enquiry, found not only
that there was no inn in the place, but not
any &s;ort of hou&s;e of public reception. The
&s;tranger, however, offered to walk on, and
enquire for a cottage to accommodate them;
for which further civility St. Aubert return|ed
his thanks, and &s;aid, that, as the village
was &s;o near, he would alight, and walk with
him. Emily followed &s;lowly in the car|riage.</P>
<P>On the way, St. Aubert a&s;ked his companion
what &s;ucce&s;s he had had in the cha&s;e. "Not
much, &s;ir," he replied, "nor do I aim at it.
I am plea&s;ed with the country, and mean to
&s;aunter away a few weeks among its &s;cenes.
My dogs I take with me more for compa|nion&s;hip
than for game. This dre&s;s, too,
gives me an osten&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s, and procures
me that re&s;pect from the people, which
would, perhaps, be refu&s;ed to a lonely &s;tran|ger,
who had no vi&s;ible motive for coming
among them."</P>
<P>"I admire your ta&s;te," &s;aid St. Aubert,
"and, if I was a younger man, &s;hould like to
<PB N="86" REF="88">
pa&s;s a few weeks in your way exceedingly.
I, too, am a wanderer, but neither my plan
nor pur&s;uits are exactly like yours&mdash;I go in
&s;earch of health, as much as of amu&s;ement."
St. Aubert &s;ighed, and pau&s;ed; and then,
&s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he re&s;umed:
"If I can hear of a tolerable road, that &s;hall
afford decent accommodation, it is my inten|tion
to pa&s;s into Rou&s;illon, and along the
&s;ea-&s;hore to Languedoc. You, &s;ir, &s;eem to
be acquainted with the country, and can,
perhaps, give me information on the &s;ub|ject."</P>
<P>The &s;tranger &s;aid, that what information
he could give was entirely at his &s;ervice;
and then mentioned a road rather more to
the ea&s;t, which led to a town, whence it
would be ea&s;y to proceed into Rou&s;illon.</P>
<P>They now arrived at the village, and com|menced
their &s;earch for a cottage, that would
afford a night's lodging. In &s;everal, which
they entered, ignorance, poverty, and mirth
&s;eemed equally to prevail; and the owners
eyed St. Aubert with a mixture of curio&s;ity
<PB N="87" REF="89">
and timidity. Nothing like a bed could be
found, and he had cea&s;ed to enquire for one,
when Emily joined him, who ob&s;erved the
languor of her father's countenance, and la|mented,
that he had taken a road &s;o ill pro|vided
with the comforts nece&s;&s;ary for an in|valid.
Other cottages, which they examin|ed,
&s;eemed &s;omewhat le&s;s &s;avage than the
former, con&s;i&s;ting of two rooms, if &s;uch they
could be called; the fir&s;t of the&s;e occupied
by mules and pigs, the &s;econd by the fa|mily,
which generally con&s;i&s;ted of fix or
eight children, with their parents, who &s;lept
on beds of &s;kins and dried beech leaves,
&s;pread upon a mud floor. Here, light was
admitted, and &s;moke di&s;charged, through
an aperture in the roof; and here the &s;cent
of &s;pirits (for the travelling &s;mugglers, who
haunted the Pyren&eacute;es, had made this rude
people familiar with the u&s;e of liquors)
was generally perceptible enough. Emi|ly
turned from &s;uch &s;cenes, and looked
at her father with anxious tenderne&s;s, which
the young &s;tranger &s;eemed to ob&s;erve; for,
<PB N="88" REF="90"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="89" REF="91"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="86" REF="92"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="87" REF="93"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="88" REF="94">
drawing St. Aubert a&s;ide, he made him an
offer of his own bed. "It is a decent
one," &s;aid he, "when compared with what
we have ju&s;t &s;een, yet &s;uch as in other cir|cum&s;tances.
I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to offer
you." St. Aubert acknowledged how much
he felt him&s;elf obliged by this kindne&s;s, but
refu&s;ed to accept it, till the young &s;tranger
would take no denial. "Do not give me
the pain of knowing, &s;ir," &s;aid he, "that
an invalid, like you, lies on hard &s;kins,
while I &s;leep in a bed. Be&s;ides, &s;ir, your
refu&s;al wounds my pride; I mu&s;t believe
you think my offer unworthy your accept|ance.
Let me &s;hew you the way. I have
no doubt my landlady can accommodate this
young lady al&s;o."</P>
<P>St. Aubert, at length, confented, that, if
this could be done, he would accept his
kindne&s;s, though he felt rather &s;urpri&s;ed,
that the &s;tranger had proved him&s;elf &s;o de|ficient
in gallantry, as to admini&s;ter to the
repo&s;e of an infirm man, rather than to that
of a very lovely young woman, for he had
<PB N="89" REF="95">
not once offered the room for Emily. But
&s;he thought nor of her&s;elf, and the animated
&s;mile &s;he gave him, told how much &s;he felt
her&s;elf obliged for the preference of her
father.</P>
<P>On their way, the &s;tranger, who&s;e name
was Valancourt, &s;tepped on fir&s;t to &s;peak to
his ho&s;te&s;s, and &s;he came out to welcome St.
Aubert into a cottage, much &s;uperior to any
he had &s;een. This good woman &s;eemed
very willing to accommodate the &s;trangers,
who were &s;oon compelled to accept the
only two beds in the place. Eggs and milk
were the only food the cottage afforded;
but again&s;t &s;carcity of provi&s;ions St. Aubert
had provided and he reque&s;ted Valancourt
to &s;tay, and partake with him of le&s;s home|ly
fare; an invitation, which was readily ac|cepted,
and they pa&s;&s;ed an hour in intelligent
conver&s;ation. St. Aubert was much plea&s;ed
with the manly frankne&s;s, and
keen &s;u&s;ceptibillty to the grrandeur of nature,
which his new acquaintance di&s;covered;
and, indeed, he had often been heared to &s;ay,








<PB N="90" REF="96">
that, without a certain &s;implicity of heart,
this ta&s;te could not exi&s;t in any &s;trong de|gree.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was interrupted by a
violent uproar without, in which the voice
of the muleteer was heard above every other
&s;ound. Valancourt &s;tarted from his &s;eat,
and went to enquire the occa&s;ion; but the
di&s;pute continued &s;o long afterwards, that
St. Aubert went him&s;elf, and found Michael
quarrelling with the ho&s;te&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he had
refu&s;ed to let his mules lie in a little room
where he and three of her &s;ons were to pa&s;s
the night. The place was wretched enough,
but there was no other for the&s;e people to
&s;leep in; and, with &s;omewhat more of deli|cacy
than was u&s;ual among the inhabitants
of this wild tract of country, &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in
refu&s;ing to let the animals have the &s;ame
<HI>bed-chamber</HI> with her children. This was a
tender point with the muleteer; his honour
was wounded when his mules were treated
with di&s;re&s;pect, and he would have received
a blow, perhaps, with more meekne&s;s. He
<PB N="91" REF="97">
declared that his bea&s;ts were as hone&s;t bea&s;ts,
and as good bea&s;ts, as any in the whole pro|vince;
and that they had a right to be well
treated wherever they went. "They are
as harmle&s;s as lambs," &s;aid he, "if people
don't affront them. I never knew them be|have
them&s;elves ami&s;s above once or twice
in my life, and then they had good rea&s;on
for doing &s;o. Once, indeed, they kicked
at a boy's leg that lay a&s;leep in the &s;table,
and broke it; but I told them they were out
there, and by Saint Anthony! I believe
they under&s;tood me, for they never did &s;o
again."</P>
<P>He concluded this eloquent harangue
with prote&s;ting, that they &s;hould &s;hare with
him, go where he would.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute was at length &s;ettled by Va|lancourt,
who drew the ho&s;te&s;s a&s;ide, and
de&s;ired &s;he would let the muleteer and his
bea&s;ts have the place in que&s;tion to them|&s;elves,
while her &s;ons &s;hould have the bed
of &s;kins de&s;igned for him, for that he would
wrap him&s;elf in his cloak, and &s;leep on the
<PB N="92" REF="98">
bench by the cottage door. But this &s;he
thought it her duty to oppo&s;e, and &s;he felt
it to be her inclination to di&s;appoint the
muleteer. Valancourt, however, was po&s;i|tive,
and the tedious affair was at length &s;et|tled.</P>
<P>It was late when St. Aubert and Emily
retired to their rooms, and Valancourt to his
&s;tation at the door, which, at this mild &s;ea|&s;on,
he preferred to a clo&s;e cabin and a bed
of &s;kins. St. Aubert was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;|ed
to find in his room volumes of Homer,
Horace, and Petrarch; but the name of Va|lancourt,
written in them, told him to whom
they belonged.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. Aubert awoke at an early hour, re|fre&s;hed
by &s;leep, and de&s;irous to &s;et for|ward.
He invited the &s;tranger to break|fa&s;t
with him; and, talking again of the
road, Valancourt &s;aid, that, &s;ome months
pa&s;t, he had travelled as far as Beaujeu,
which was a town of &s;ome con&s;equence on
the way to Rou&s;illon. He recommended
it to St. Aubert to take that route, and the
latter determined to do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="100">
"The road from this hamlet," &s;aid Va|lancourt,
"and that to Beaujeu, part at the
di&s;tance of about a league and an half from
hence; if you will give me leave, I will di|rect
your muleteer &s;o far. I mu&s;t wander
&s;omewhere, and your company would make
this a plea&s;anter ramble than any other I
could take."</P>
<P>St. Aubert thankfully accepted his of|fer,
and they &s;et out together, the young
&s;tranger on foot, for he refu&s;ed the invita|tion
of St. Aubert to take a &s;eat in his lit|tle
carriage.</P>
<P>The road wound along the feet of the
mountains through a pa&s;toral valley, bright
with verdure, and varied with groves of
dwarf oak, beech, and &s;ycamore, under
who&s;e branches herds of cattle repo&s;ed.
The mountain-a&s;h too, and the weeping
birch, often threw their pendant foliage
over the &s;teeps above, where the &s;canty &s;oil
&s;carcely concealed their roots, and where
their light branches waved to every breeze
that fluttered from the mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101">
The travellers were frequently met at
this early hour, for the &s;un had not yet ri&s;en
upon the valley, by &s;hepherds driving im|men&s;e
flocks from their folds to feed upon
the hills. St. Aubert had &s;et out thus
early, not only that he might enjoy the fir&s;t
appearance of &s;un-ri&s;e, but that he might
inhale the fir&s;t pure breath of morning,
which above all things is refre&s;hing to the
&s;pirits of the invalid. In the&s;e regions it
was particularly &s;o, where an abundance of
wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed
forth their e&s;&s;ence on the air.</P>
<P>The dawn, which &s;oftened the &s;cenery
with its peculiar grey tint, now di&s;per&s;ed,
and Emily watched the progre&s;s of the
day, fir&s;t trembling on the tops of the
highe&s;t cliffs, then touching them with &s;plen|did
light, while their &s;ides and the vale be|low
were &s;till wrapt in dewy mi&s;t. Mean|while,
the &s;ullen grey of the ea&s;tern clouds
began to blu&s;h, then to redden, and then to
glow with a thou&s;and colours, till the
golden light darted over all the air, touched
<PB N="96" REF="102">
the lower points of the mountain's brow,
and glanced in long &s;loping beams upon
the valley and its &s;tream. All nature
&s;eemed to have awakened from death into
life; the &s;pirit of St. Aubert was reno|vated.
His heart was full; hewept, and his
thoughts a&s;cended to the Great Creator.</P>
<P>Emily wi&s;hed to trip along the turf, &s;o
green and bright with dew, and to ta&s;te the
full delight of that liberty, which the
izard &s;eemed to enjoy as he bounded along
the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt
often &s;topped to &s;peak with the travellers,
and with &s;ocial feeling to point out to them
the peculiar objects of his admiration. St.
Aubert was plea&s;ed with him: "Here is
the real ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and ardour of
youth," &s;aid he to him&s;elf; "this young
man has never been at Paris."</P>
<P>He was &s;orry when they came to the &s;pot
where the roads parted, and his heart took
a more affectionate leave of him than is
u&s;ual after &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. Va|lancourt
talked long by the &s;ide of the car|riage;
<PB N="97" REF="103">
&s;eemed more than once to be
going, but &s;till lingered, and appeared to
&s;earch anxiou&s;ly for topics of conver&s;ation
to account for his delay. At length he
took leave. As he went, St. Aubert ob|&s;erved
him look with an earne&s;t and pen&s;ive
eye at Emily, who bowed to him with a
countenance full of timid &s;weetne&s;s, while
the carriage drove on. St. Aubert, for what|ever
rea&s;on, &s;oon after looked from the
window, and &s;aw Valancourt &s;tanding upon
the bank of the road, re&s;ting on his pike
with folded arms, and following the car|riage
with his eyes. He waved his hand,
and Valancourt, &s;eeming to awake from
his reverie, returned the &s;alute, and &s;tarted
away.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the country now began
to change, and the travellers &s;oon found
them&s;elves among mountains covered from
their ba&s;e nearly to their &s;ummits with
fore&s;ts of gloomy pine, except where a
rock of granite &s;hot up from the vale, and
lo&s;t its &s;nowy top in the clouds. The ri|vulte,
<PB N="98" REF="104">
which had hitherto accompanied
them, now expanded into a river; and,
flowing deeply and &s;ilently along, reflected,
as in a mirror, the blackne&s;s of the im|pending
&s;hades. Sometimes a cliff was
&s;een lifting its bold head above the woods
and the vapours, that floated mid-way down
the mountains; and &s;ometimes a face of
perpendicular marble ro&s;e from the water's
edge, over which the larch threw his gigan|tic
arms, here &s;cathed with lightning, and
there floating in luxuriant foliage.</P>
<P>They continued to travel over a rough
and unfrequented road, &s;eeing now and
then at a di&s;tance the &s;olitary &s;hepherd,
with his dog, &s;talking along the valley,
and hearing only the da&s;hing of torrents,
which the woods concealed from the eye,
the long &s;ullen murmur of the breeze, as it
&s;wept over the pines, or the notes of the ea|gle
and the vulture, which were &s;een tow|ering
round the beetling cliff.</P>
<P>Often, as the carriage moved &s;lowly
over uneven ground, St. Aubert alighted,
<PB N="99" REF="105">
and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with examining the
curious plants that grew on the banks
of the road, and with which the&s;e re|gions
abound; while Emily, wrapt in
high enthu&s;ia&s;m, wandered away under the
&s;hades, li&s;tening in deep &s;ilence to the
lonely murmur of the woods.</P>
<P>Neither village nor hamlet was &s;een for
many leagues; the goat-herd's or the
hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of
the rocks, were the only human habitations
that appeared.</P>
<P>The travellers again took their dinner in
the open air, on a plea&s;ant &s;pot in the val|ley,
under the &s;preading &s;hade of cedars;
and then &s;et forward towards Beaujeu.</P>
<P>The road now began to a&s;cend, and,
leaving the pine fore&s;ts behind, wound
among rocky precipices. The evening
twilight again fell over the &s;cene, and
the travellers were ignorant how far they
might yet be from Beaujeu. St. Au|bert,
however, conjectured that the di&s;tance
could not be very great, and comforted
<PB N="100" REF="106">
him&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of travelling on a
more frequented road after reaching that
town, where he de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night.
Mingled woods, and rocks, and heathy
mountains were now &s;een ob&s;curely through
the du&s;k; but &s;oon even the&s;e imperfect
images faded in darkne&s;s. Michael pro|ceeded
with caution, for he could &s;carcely
di&s;tingui&s;h the road; his mules, however,
&s;eemed to have more &s;agacity, and their
&s;teps were &s;ure.</P>
<P>On turning the angle of a mountain, a
light appeared at a di&s;tance, that illumi|ned
the rocks, and the horizon to a great
extent. It was evidently a large fire, but
whether accidental, or otherwi&s;e, there
were no means of knowing. St. Aubert
thought it was probably kindled by &s;ome of
the numerous banditti, that infe&s;ted the Py|ren&eacute;es,
and he became watchful and anxious
to know whether the road pa&s;&s;ed near this
fire. He had arms with him, which, on an
emergency, might afford &s;ome protection,
though certainly a very unequal one, again&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="107">
a band of robbers, &s;o de&s;perate too as tho&s;e
u&s;ually were who haunted the&s;e wild re|gions.
While many reflections ro&s;e upon
his mind, he heard a voice &s;houting
from the road behind, and ordering the
muleteer to &s;top. St. Aubert bade him
proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; but either Mi|chael,
or his mules were ob&s;tinate, for they
did not quit the old pace. Hor&s;es' feet were
now heard; a man rode up to the car|riage,
&s;till ordering the driver to &s;top; and
St. Aubert, who could no longer doubt
his purpo&s;e, was with difficulty able to
prepare a pi&s;tol for his defence, when his
hand was upon the door of the chai&s;e.
The man &s;taggered on his hor&s;e, the re|port
of the pi&s;tol was followed by a groan,
and St. Aubert's horror may be imagined,
when in the next in&s;tant he thought he
heard the faint voice of Valancourt. He
now him&s;elf bade the muleteer &s;top; and,
pronouncing the name of Valancourt, was
an&s;wered in a voice, that no longer &s;uffered
him to doubt. St. Aubert, who in&s;tantly
<PB N="102" REF="108">
alighted and went to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, found
him &s;till &s;itting on his hor&s;e, but bleeding
profu&s;ely, and appearing to be in great
pain, though he endeavoured to &s;often the
terror of St. Aubert by a&s;&s;urances that he
was not materially hurt, the wound being
only in his arm. St. Aubert, with the
muleteer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to di&s;mount, and he
&s;at down on the bank of the road, where
St. Aubert tried to bind up his arm, but his
hands trembled &s;o exce&s;&s;ively that he could
not accompli&s;h it; and, Michael being now
gone in pur&s;uit of the hor&s;e, which, on be|ing
di&s;engaged from his rider, had gal|loped
off, he called Emily to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
Receiving no an&s;wer, he went to the car|riage,
and found her &s;unk on the &s;eat in a
fainting fit. Between the di&s;tre&s;s of this
circum&s;tance and that of leaving Valan|court
bleeding, he &s;carcely knew what he
did; he endeavoured, however, to rai&s;e
her, and called to Michael to fetch water
from the rivulet that flowed by the road,
but Michael was gone beyond the reach of
<PB N="103" REF="109">
his voice. Valancourt, who heard the&s;e
calls, and al&s;o the repeated name of Emily,
in&s;tantly under&s;tood the &s;ubject of his di&s;|tre&s;s
and, almo&s;t forgetting his own con|dition,
he ha&s;tened to her relief. She was
reviving when he reached the carriage; and
then, under&s;tanding that anxiety for him had
occa&s;ioned her indi&s;po&s;ition, he a&s;&s;ured her,
in a voice that trembled, but not from an|gui&s;h,
that his wound was of no con&s;e|quence.
While he &s;aid this St. Aubert
turned round, and perceiving that he was
&s;till bleeding, the &s;ubject of his alarm
changed again, and he ha&s;tily formed &s;ome
handkerchiefs into a bandage. This &s;top|ped
the effusion of the blood; but St. Au|bert,
dreading the con&s;equence of the
wound, enquired repeatedly how far they
were from Beaujeu; when, learning that it
was at two leagues di&s;tance, his di&s;tre&s;s in|crea&s;ed,
&s;ince he knew not how Valancourt,
in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, would bear the motion
of the carriage, and perceived that he was
already faint from lo&s;s of blood. When he
<PB N="104" REF="110">
mentioned the &s;ubject of his anxiety, Va|lancourt
entreated that he would not &s;uffer
him&s;elf to be thus alarmed on his account,
for that he had no doubt he &s;hould be able
to &s;upport him&s;elf very well; and then he
talked of the accident as a &s;light one. The
muleteer being now returned with Valan|court's
hor&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him into the chai&s;e;
and, as Emily was now revived, they moved
&s;lowly on towards Beaujeu.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, when he had recovered from
the terror occa&s;ioned him by this accident,
expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e on &s;eeing Valancourt,
who explained his unexpected appearance
by &s;aying, "You, Sir, renewed my ta&s;te
for &s;ociety; when you had left the hamlet,
it did indeed appear a &s;olitude. I deter|mined,
therefore, &s;ince my object was merely
amu&s;ement, to change the &s;cene; and I took
this road, becau&s;e I knew it led through a
more romantic tract of mountains than the
&s;pot I have left. Be&s;ides," added he, he&s;i|tating
for an in&s;tant, "I will own, and
<PB N="105" REF="111">
why &s;hould I not? that I had &s;ome hope of
overtaking you."</P>
<P>"And I have made you a very unexpected
return for the compliment," &s;aid St. Au|bert,
who lamented again the ra&s;hne&s;s
which had produced the accident, and ex|plained
the cau&s;e of his late alarm. But
Valancourt &s;eemed anxious only to remove
from the minds of his companions every un|plea&s;ant
feeling relative to him&s;elf; and, for
that purpo&s;e, &s;till &s;truggled again&s;t a &s;en&s;e
of pain, and tried to conver&s;e with gaiety.
Emily meanwhile was &s;ilent, except when
Valancourt particularly addre&s;&s;ed her, and
there was at tho&s;e times a tremulous tone
in his voice that &s;poke much.</P>
<P>They were now &s;o near the fire, which had
long flamed at a di&s;tance on the blackne&s;s
of night, that it gleamed upon the road,
and they could di&s;tingui&s;h figures moving
about the blaze. The way winding &s;till
nearer, they perceived in the valley one of
tho&s;e numerous bands of gip&s;ies, which
at that period particularly haunted the
<PB N="106" REF="112">
wilds of the Pyren&eacute;es, and lived partly by
plundering the traveller. Emily looked
with &s;ome degree of terror on the &s;avage
countenances of the&s;e people, &s;hewn by the
&s;ire, which heightened the romantic effect
of the &s;cenery, as it threw a red du&s;ky gleam
upon the rocks and on the foliage of the
trees, leaving heavy ma&s;&s;es of &s;hade and
regions of ob&s;curity, which the eye feared
to penetrate.</P>
<P>They were preparing their &s;upper; a
large pot &s;tood by the fire, over which &s;e|veral
figures were bu&s;y. The blaze di&s;co|vered
a rude kind of tent, round which
many children and dogs were playing, and
the whole formed a picture highly gro|te&s;que.
The travellers &s;aw plainly their
danger. Valancourt was &s;ilent, but laid
his hand on one of St. Aubert's pi&s;tols;
St. Aubert drew forth another, and Mi|chael
was ordered to proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible.
They pa&s;&s;ed the place, however,
without being attacked; the rovers being
<PB N="107" REF="113">
probably unprepared for the opportunity,
and too bu&s;y about their &s;upper to feel
much intere&s;t, at the moment, in any thing
be&s;ides.</P>
<P>After a league and a half more, pa&s;&s;ed
in darkne&s;s, the travellers arrived at Beaujeu,
and drove up to the only inn the place af|forded;
which, though &s;uperior to any they
had &s;een &s;ince they entered the mountains,
was bad enough.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon of the town was immedi|ately
&s;ent for, if a &s;urgeon he could be
called, who pre&s;cribed for hor&s;es as well as
for men, and &s;haved faces at lea&s;t as dexte|rou&s;ly
as he &s;et bones. After examining
Valancourt's arm, and perceiving that the
bullet had pa&s;&s;ed through the fle&s;h without
touching the bone, he dre&s;&s;ed it, and left
him with a &s;olemn pre&s;cription of quiet,
which his patient was not inclined to obey
The delight of ea&s;e had now &s;ucceeded to
pain; for ea&s;e may be allowed to a&s;&s;ume
a po&s;itive quality when contra&s;ted with
angui&s;h; and, his &s;pirits thus re-animated,

he wi&s;hed to partake of the conver&s;ation of
St. Aubert and Emily, who, relea&s;ed from
&s;o many apprehen&s;ions, were uncommonly
cheerful. Late as it was, however, St.
Aubert was obliged to go out with the
landlord to buy meat for &s;upper; and
Emily, who, during this interval, had been
ab&s;ent as long as &s;he could, upon excu&s;es of
looking to their accommodation, which &s;he
found rather better than &s;he expected, was
compelled to return, and conver&s;e with
Valancourt alone. They talked of the
character of the &s;cenes they had pa&s;&s;ed, of
the natural hi&s;tory of the country, of poetry,
and of St. Aubert; a &s;ubject on which
Emily always &s;poke and li&s;tened to with
peculiar plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The travellers pa&s;&s;ed an agreeable even|ing,
but St. Aubert was fatigued with his
journey; and, as Valancourt &s;eemed again
&s;en&s;ible of pain, they &s;eparated &s;oon after
&s;upper.</P>
<P>In the morning St. Aubert found that
Valancourt had pa&s;&s;ed, a re&s;tle&s;s night;
<PB N="109" REF="119">
that he was feveri&s;h, and his wound very
painful. The &s;urgeon, when he dre&s;&s;ed it,
advi&s;ed him to remain quietly at Beaujeu;
advice which was too rea&s;onable to be re|jected.
St. Aubert, however, had no fa|vourable
opinion of this practitioner, and
was anxious to commit Valancourt into
more &s;kilful hands; but learning, upon en|quiry,
that there was no town within &s;everal
leagues which &s;eemed more likely to afford
better advice, he altered the plan of, his
journey, and determined to await the reco|very
of Valancourt, who, with &s;omewhat
more ceremony than, &s;incerity, made, many
objections to this delay.</P>
<P>By order of his furgeon, Valancourt did
not go out of the hou&s;e that day; but St.
Aubert and Emily &s;urveyed with delight
the environs of the town, &s;ituated at the feet
of the Pyrenean Alps, that ro&s;e, &s;ome in
abrupt precipices, and others &s;welling with,
woods of cedar, &s;ir, and cypre&s;s, which
&s;tretched nearly to their, highe&s;t &s;ummits.
The cheerful green of the beech and
<PB N="110" REF="120">
mountain-a&s;h was &s;ometimes &s;een, like a
gleam of light, amid&s;t the dark verdure of
the fore&s;t; and &s;ometimes a torrent poured
its &s;parkling flood, high among the woods.</P>
<P>Valancourt's indi&s;po&s;ition detained the
travellers at Beaujeu &s;everal days, during
which interval St. Aubert had ob&s;erved his
di&s;po&s;ition and his talents with the philo&s;o|phic
enquiry &s;o natural to him. He &s;aw a
frank and generous nature, full of ardour,
highly &s;u&s;ceptible of whatever is grand and
beautiful, but impetuous, wild, and &s;ome|what
romantic. Valancourt had known
little of the world. His perceptions were
clear, and his feelings ju&s;t; his indigna|nation
of an unworthy, or his admiration of
a generous action, were expre&s;&s;ed in terms
of equal vehemence. St. Aubert &s;ometimes
&s;miled at his warmth, but &s;eldom checked it,
and often repeated to him&s;elf, "This young
man has never been at Paris." A &s;igh &s;ome|times
followed this &s;ilent ejaculation. He
determined not to leave Valancourt till he
&s;hould be perfectly recovered; and, as he was
<PB N="111" REF="121">
now well enough to travel, though not able
to manage his hor&s;e, St. Aubert invited
him to accompany him for a few days in the
carriage. This he the more readily did,
&s;ince he had di&s;covered that Valancourt
was of a family of the &s;ame name in Ga&s;|cony,
with who&s;e re&s;pectability he was well
acquainted. The latter accepted the offer
with great plea&s;ure, and they again &s;et
forward among the&s;e romantic wilds to|wards
Rou&s;illon.</P>
<P>They travelled lei&s;urely; &s;topping where|ever
a &s;cene uncommonly grand appeared;
frequently alighting to walk to an emi|nence,
whither the mules could not go,
from which the pro&s;pect opened in greater
magnificence; and often &s;auntering over
hillocks covered with lavender, wild thyme,
juniper, and tamari&s;c; and under the
&s;hades of woods, between who&s;e boles they
caught the long mountain-vi&s;ta, &s;ublime
beyond any thing that Emily had ever ima|gined.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="122">
St. Aubert &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf
with botanizing, while Valancourt and
Emily &s;trolled on; he pointing out to her
notice the objects that particularly charmed
him, and reciting beautiful pa&s;&s;ages from
&s;uch of the Latin and Italian poets as he
had heard her admire. In the pau&s;es of
conver&s;ation, when he thought him&s;elf not
ob&s;erved, he frequently fixed his eyes pen|&s;ively
on her countenance, which expre&s;&s;ed
with &s;o much animation the ta&s;te and energy
of her mind; and when he &s;poke again,
there was a peculiar tenderne&s;s in the tone
of his voice, that defeated any attempt to
conceal his &s;entiments. By degrees the&s;e
&s;ilent pau&s;es became more frequent; till
Emily, only, betrayed an anxiety to inter|rupt
them; and &s;he, who had been hitherto
re&s;erved, would now talk again, and again,
of the woods and the vallies and the
mountains, to avoid the danger of &s;ympa|thy
and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>From Beaujeu the road had con&s;tantly
a&s;cended, conducting the travellers into the
<PB N="113" REF="123">
higher regions of the air, where immen&s;e
glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors, and
eternal &s;now whitened the &s;ummits of the
mountains. They often pau&s;ed to contem|plate
the&s;e &s;tupendous &s;cenes, and, &s;eated on
&s;ome wild cliff, where only the ilex or the
larch could flouri&s;h, looked over dark
fore&s;ts of fir, and precipices where human
foot had never wandered, into the glen&mdash;&s;o
deep, that the thunder of the torrent,
which was &s;een to foam along the bottom,
was &s;carcely heard to murmur. Over the&s;e
crags ro&s;e others of &s;tupendous height,
and fanta&s;tic &s;hape; &s;ome &s;hooting into
cones; others impending far over their
ba&s;e, in huge ma&s;&s;es of granite, along
who&s;e broken ridges was often lodged a
weight of &s;now, that, trembling even to the
vibration of a found, threatened to bear de|&s;truction
in its cour&s;e to the vale. Around,
on every &s;ide, far as the eye could penetrate,
were &s;een only forms of grandeur&mdash;the
long per&s;pective of mountain tops, tinged
with ethereal blue, or white with &s;now;
<PB N="114" REF="124">
vallies of ice, and fore&s;ts of gloomy fir.
The &s;erenity and clearne&s;s of the air in
The&s;e high regions were particularly de|lightful
to the travellers; it &s;eemed to in|&s;pire
them with a finer &s;pirit, and diffu&s;ed
an inde&s;cribable complacency over their
minds. They had no words to ex|pre&s;s
the &s;ublime emotions they felt. A so|lemn
expre&s;&s;ion characterized the feelings of
St. Aubert; tears often came to his eyes,
and he frequently walked away from his
companions. Valancourt now and then
&s;poke, to point to Emily's notice &s;ome fea|ture
of the &s;cene. The thinne&s;s of the at|mo&s;phere,
through which every object
came &s;o di&s;tinctly to the eye, &s;urpri&s;ed and
deluded her; who could &s;carcely believe
that objects, which appeared &s;o near, were,
in reality, &s;o di&s;tant. The deep &s;ilence of
the&s;e &s;olitudes was broken only at intervals
by the &s;cream of the vultures, &s;een cowering
round &s;ome cliff below, or by the cry of
the eagle &s;ailing high in the air; except
when the travellers li&s;tened to the hollow
<PB N="115" REF="125">
thunder that &s;ometimes muttered at their
feet. While, above, the deep blue of the
heavens was unob&s;cured by the lighte&s;t
cloud, half way down the mountains, long
billows of vapour were frequently &s;een roll|ing,
now wholly excluding the country be|low,
and now opening, and partially reveal|ing
its features. Emily delighted to ob&s;erve
the grandeur of the&s;e clouds as they
changed in &s;hape and tints, and to watch
their various effect on the lower world,
who&s;e features, partly veiled, were continu|ally
a&s;&s;uming new forms of &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>After traver&s;ing the&s;e regions for many
leagues, they began to de&s;cend towards
Rou&s;illon, and features of beauty then min|gled
with the &s;cene. Yet the travellers did
not look back without &s;ome regret to the
&s;ublime objects they had quitted; though
the eye, fatigued with the exten&s;ion of its
powers, was glad to repo&s;e on the verdure
of woods and pa&s;tures, that now hung on
the margin of the river below; to view
again the humble cottage &s;haded by cedars,
<PB N="116" REF="126">
the playful group of mountaineer-children,
and the flowery nooks that appeared among
the hills.</P>
<P>As they de&s;cended, they &s;aw at a di&s;tance,
on the right, one of the grand pa&s;&s;es of the
Pyrene&aacute;es into Spain, gleaming with its bat|tlements
and towers to the &s;plendour of the
&s;etting rays, yellow tops of woods colouring
the &s;teeps below, while far above a&s;pired the
&s;nowy points of the mountains, &s;till reflect|ing
a ro&s;y hue.</P>
<P>St. Aubert began to look out for the lit|tle
town he had been directed to by the
people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to
pa&s;s the night; but no habitation yet ap|peared.
Of its di&s;tance Valancourt could
not a&s;&s;i&s;t him to judge, for he had never
been &s;o far along this chain of Alps before.
There was, however, a road to guide them;
and there could be little doubt that it was
the right one; for, &s;ince they had left
Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks
to perplex or mi&s;lead.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="127">
The &s;un now gave his la&s;t light, and St.
Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with all
Po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. He found, indeed, the
la&s;&s;itude of iline&s;s return upon him, af|ter
a day of uncommon fatigue, both of
body and mind, and he longed for re|po&s;e.
His anxiety was not &s;oothed by
Ob&s;erving a numerous train, con&s;i&s;ting of
men, hor&s;es, and loaded mules, winding
down the &s;teeps of an oppo&s;ite mountain,
appearing and di&s;appearing at intervals
among the woods, &s;o that its numbers could
not be judged of. Something bright, like
arms, glanced in the &s;etting ray, and the
military dre&s;s was di&s;tingui&s;hable upon the
men who were in the van, and on others
&s;cattered among the troop that followed.
As the&s;e wound into the vale, the rear of
the party emerged from the woods, and ex|habited
a band of &s;oldiers. St. Aubert's
apprehend&s;ions now &s;ub&s;ided; he had no
doubt that the train before him con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;mugglers, who, in conveying prohibited
<PB N="118" REF="128">
goods over the Pyren&eacute;es, had been encoun|tered,
and conquered by a party of troops.</P>
<P>The travellers had lingered &s;o long among
the &s;ublimer &s;cenes of the&s;e mountains,
that they found them&s;elves entirely mi&s;ta|ken
in their calculation that they could reach
Montigny at &s;un-&s;et; but, as they wound
along the valley, they &s;aw, on a rude
Alpine bridge, that united two lofty crags
of the glen, a group of mountaineer-children,
amu&s;ing them&s;elves with dropping
pebbles into a torrent below, and watching
the &s;tones plunge into the water, that threw
up its white &s;pray high in the air as it received
them, and returned a &s;ullen found, which
the echoes of the mountains prolonged.
Under the bridge was &s;een a per&s;pective of
the valley, with its cataract de&s;cending
among the rocks, and a cottage on a cliff,
over&s;hadowed with pines. It appeared,
that they could not be far from &s;ome &s;mall
town. St. Aubert bade the muleteer &s;top,
and then called to the children to enquire
<PB N="119" REF="129">
if he was near Montigny; but the di&s;tance,
and the roaring of the waters, would not
&s;uffer his voice to be heard; and the crags,
adjoining the bridge, were of &s;uch tremen|dous
height and &s;teepne&s;s, that to have
climbed either would have been &s;carcely
practicable to a per&s;on unacquainted with
the a&s;cent. St. Aubert, therefore, did not
wa&s;te more moments in delay. They con|tinued
to travel long after twilight had ob|&s;cured
the road, which was &s;o broken, that,
now thinking it &s;afer to walk than to ride,
they all alighted. The moon was ri&s;ing, but
her light was yet too feeble to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.
While they &s;tepped carefully on, they heard
the ve&s;per-bell of a convent. The twilight
would not permit them to di&s;tingui&s;h any
thing like a building, but the &s;ounds &s;eemed
to come from &s;ome woods, that overhung
an acclivity to the right. Valancourt pro|po&s;ed
to go in &s;earch of this convent. "If
they will not accommodate us with a night's
lodging," &s;aid he, "they may certainly
<PB N="120" REF="130">
inform us how far we are from Montigny,
and direct us towards it." He was bound|ing
forward, without waiting St. Aubert's
reply, when the latter &s;topped him. "I
am very weary," &s;aid St. Aubert, "and
wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as for immediate
re&s;t. We will all go to the convent; your
good looks would defeat our purpo&s;e; but
when they &s;ee mine and Emily's exhau&s;ted
countenances, they will &s;carcely deny us
repo&s;e."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he took Emily's arm
within his, and, telling Michael to wait a
while in the road with the carriage, they be|gan
to a&s;cend towards the woods, guided
by the bell of the convent. His &s;teps
were feeble, and Valancourt offered him his
arm, which he accepted. The moon now
threw a faint light over their path, and,
&s;oon after, enabled them to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome
towers ri&s;ing above the tops of the woods.
Still following the note of the bell, they en|tered
the &s;hade of tho&s;e woods, lighted
only by the moon-beams, that glided down
<PB N="121" REF="131">
between the leaves, and threw a tremulous
uncertain gleam upon the &s;teep track they
were winding. The gloom and the &s;ilence
that prevailed, except when the bell re|turned
upon the air, together with the wild|ne&s;s
of the &s;urrounding &s;cene, &s;truck Emily
with a degree of fear, which, however, the
voice and conver&s;ation of Valancourt &s;ome|what
repre&s;&s;ed. When they had been &s;ome
time a&s;cending, St. Aubert complained of
wearin&s;s, and they &s;topped to re&s;t upon a
little green &s;ummit, where the trees opened,
and admitted the moon-light. He fat down
upon the turf, between Emily and Valan|court.
The bell had now cea&s;ed, and the
deep repo&s;e of the &s;cene was undi&s;turbed
by any found, for the low dull murmur
of &s;ome di&s;tant torrents might be &s;aid to
&s;ooth, rather than to interrupt, the &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>Before them, extended the valley they
had quitted; its rocks, and woods to the
left, ju&s;t &s;ilvered by the rays, formed a con|tra&s;t
to the deep &s;hadow, that involved the
<PB N="122" REF="132">
oppo&s;ite cliffs, who&s;e fringed &s;ummits only
were tipped with light; while the di&s;tant
per&s;pective of the valley was lo&s;t in the yel|low
mi&s;t of moon-light. The travellers &s;at
for &s;ome time wrapt in the complacency
which &s;uch &s;cenes in&s;pire.</P>
<P>"Thefe &s;cenes," &s;aid Valancourt, at length,
"&s;often the heart, like the notes of &s;weet
mu&s;ic, and in&s;pire that delicious melancholy
which no per&s;on, who had felt it once, would
re&s;ign for the gaye&s;t plea&s;ures. They waken
our be&s;t and pure&s;t feelings, di&s;po&s;ing us to
benevolence, pity, and friend&s;hip. Tho&s;e
whom I love&mdash;I always &s;eem to love more
in &s;uch an hour as this." His voice trem|bled,
and he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was &s;ilent; Emily perceived a
warm tear fall upon the hand he held; &s;he
knew the object of his thoughts; hers too
had, for &s;ome time, been occupied by the
remembrance of her mother. He &s;eemed
by an effort to rou&s;e himfelf. "Yes," &s;aid
he, with an half-&s;upper&s;&s;ed &s;igh, "the me|mory
of tho&s;e we love&mdash;of times for ever
<PB N="123" REF="133">
pa&s;t! in &s;uch an hour as this &s;teals upon
the mind, like a &s;train of di&s;tant mu&s;ic in
the &s;tillne&s;s of night;&mdash;all tender and har|monious
as this land&s;cape, &s;leeping in the
mellow moon-light." After the pau&s;e of
a moment, St. Aubert added, "I have al|ways
fancied, that I thought with more
clearne&s;s, and preci&s;ion, at &s;uch an hour than
at any other, and that heart mu&s;t be in&s;en|&s;ible
in a great degree, that does not &s;often
to its influence. But many &s;uch there are."</P>
<P>Valancourt &s;ighed.</P>
<P>"Are there, indeed, many &s;uch?" &s;aid
Emily.</P>
<P>"A few years hence, my Emily," re|plied
St. Aubert, "and you may &s;mile at
the recollection of that que&s;tion&mdash;if you do
not weep to it. But come, I am &s;omewhat
refre&s;hed, let us proceed."</P>
<P>Having emerged from the woods, they
few, upon a turfy hillock above, the con|vent
of which they were in &s;earch. An high
wall, that &s;urrounded it, led them to an an|cient
gate, at which they knocked; and the
<PB N="124" REF="134">
poor monk, who opened it, conduced them
into a &s;mall adjoining room, where he de|&s;ired
they would wait while he informed the
&s;uperior of their reque&s;t. In this interval,
&s;everal friars came in &s;eparately to look at
them; and at length the fir&s;t monk return|ed,
and they followed him to a room, where
the &s;uperior was &s;itting in an arm chair,
with a large folio volume, printed in black
letter, open on a de&s;k before him. He re|ceived
them with courte&s;y, though he did
not ri&s;e from his feat; and, having a&s;ked
them a few que&s;tions, grafted their reque&s;t.
After a &s;hort conver&s;ation, formal and so|lemn
on the part of the &s;uperior, they with|drew
to the apartment where they were to
&s;up, and Valancourt, whom one of the in|ferior
friars civilly de&s;ired to accompany,
went to &s;eek Michael and his mules. They
had not de&s;cended half way down the cliffs,
before they heard the voice of the muleteer
echoing far and wide. Sometimes he called
on St. Aubert, and &s;ometimes on Valan|court,
who having, at length, convinced him
<PB N="125" REF="135">
that he had nothing to fear either for him|&s;elf,
or his ma&s;ter; and having di&s;po&s;ed of
him, for the night, in a cottage on the &s;kirt
of the woods, returned to &s;up with his friends,
on &s;uch &s;ober fare as the monks thought it
prudent to &s;et before them. While St. Au|bert
was too much indi&s;po&s;ed to &s;hare it,
Emily, in her anxiety for her father, forgot
her&s;elf; and Valancourt, &s;ilent and thought|ful,
yet never inattentive to them, appear|ed
particularly &s;olicitous to accommodate
and relieve St. Aubert, who often ob&s;erv|ed,
while his daughter was pre&s;&s;ing him to
eat, or adju&s;ting the pillow &s;he had placed
in the back of his arm-chair, that Valan|court
fixed on her a look of pen&s;ive tender|ne&s;s,
which he was not di&s;plea&s;ed to under|&s;tand.</P>
<P>They &s;eparated at an early hour, and re|tired
to their re&s;pective apartments. Emi|ly
was &s;hown to hers by a nun of the con|vent,
whom &s;he was glad to di&s;mi&s;s, for
her heart was melancholy, and her attention
&s;o much ab&s;tracted, that conver&s;ation with
<PB N="126" REF="136">
a &s;tranger was painful. She thought her
father daily declining, and attributed his
pre&s;ent fatigue more to the feeble &s;tate of
his frame, than to the difficulty of the jour|ney.
A train of gloomy ideas haunted her
mind, till &s;he fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>In about two hours after, &s;he was awaken|ed
by the chiming of a bell, and then heard
quick &s;teps pa&s;s along the gallery, into
which her chamber opened. She was &s;o lit|tle
accu&s;tomed to the manners of a convent,
as to be alarmed by this circum&s;tance; her
fears, ever alive for her father, &s;ugge&s;ted
that he was very ill, and &s;he ro&s;e in ha&s;te
to go to him. Having pau&s;ed, however, to
let the per&s;ons in the gallery pa&s;s before
&s;he opened her door, her thoughts, in the
mean time, recovered from the confu&s;ion
of &s;leep, and &s;he under&s;tood that the bell
was the call of the monks to prayers. It
had now cea&s;ed, and, all being again &s;till, &s;he
forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Her
mind was not di&s;po&s;ed for immediate &s;leep,
and the moon-light, that &s;hone into her
<PB N="127" REF="137">
chamber, invited her to open the ca&s;ement,
and look out upon the country.</P>
<P>It was a &s;till and beautiful night, the &s;ky
was unob&s;cured by any cloud, and &s;carce a
leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the
air. As &s;he li&s;tened, the mid-night hymn
of the monks ro&s;e &s;oftly from a chapel,
that &s;tood on one of the lower cliffs, an
holy &s;train, that &s;eemed to a&s;cend through
the &s;ilence of night to heaven, and her
thoughts a&s;cended with it. From the con|&s;ideration
of his works, her mind aro&s;e to
the adoration of the Deity, in his goodne&s;s
and power; wherever &s;he turned her view,
whether on the &s;leeping earth, or to the va&s;t
regions of &s;pace, glowing with worlds be|yond
the reach of human thought, the &s;ublimity
of God, and the maje&s;ty of his pre&s;ence
appeared. Her eyes were filled with tears
of awful love and admiration; and &s;he felt
that pure devotion, &s;uperior to all the di&s;|tinctions
of human &s;y&s;tem, which lifts the
&s;oul above this world, and &s;eems to expand
it into a nobler nature; &s;uch devotion as
<PB N="128" REF="138">
can, perhaps, only be experienced, when
the mind, re&s;cued, for a moment, from the
humblene&s;s of earthly con&s;iderations, a&s;|pires
to contemplate His power in the &s;ubli|mity
of His works, and His goodne&s;s in the
infinity of His ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Is it not now the hour,</L>

<P>The midnight chant of the monks &s;oon
after dropped into &s;ilence; but Emily re|mained
at the ca&s;ement, watching the &s;et|ting
moon, and the valley &s;inking into deep
&s;hade, and willing to prolong her pre&s;ent
&s;tate of mind. At length &s;he retired to
her matter&s;s, and &s;unk into tranquil &s;lumber.</P>

<P>St. AUBERT, &s;ufficiently re&s;tored by a
night's repo&s;e to pur&s;ue his journey, &s;et out
in the morning, with his family and Valan|court,
for Rou&s;illon, which he hoped to
reach before night-fall. The &s;cenes, through
which they now pa&s;&s;ed, were as wild and
romantic, as any they had yet ob&s;erved, with
this difference, that beauty, every now and
then, &s;oftened the land&s;cape into &s;miles.
Little woody rece&s;&s;es appeared among the
mountains, covered with bright verdure
and flowers; or a pa&s;toral valley, opened its
gra&s;&s;y bo&s;om in the &s;hade of the cliffs, with
flocks and herds loitering along the banks
<PB N="130" REF="140">
of a rivulet, that refre&s;hed it with perpetual
green. St. Aubert could not repent the
having taken this fatiguing road, though
he was this day, al&s;o, frequently obliged to
alight, to walk along the rugged precipice,
and to climb the &s;teep and flinty mountain.
The wonderful &s;ublimity and variety of the
Pro&s;pects repaid him for all this, and the en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
with which they were viewed by
his young companions, heightened his own,
and awakened a remembrance of all the de|lightful
emotions of his early days, when
the &s;ublime charms of nature were fir&s;t un|veiled
to him. He found great plea&s;ure in
conver&s;ing with Valancourt, and in li&s;tening
to his ingenuous remarks. The fire and
&s;implicity of his manners &s;eemed to render
him a characteri&s;tic figure in the &s;cenes
around them; and St. Aubert di&s;covered in
his &s;entiments the ju&s;tne&s;s and the dignity
of an elevated mind, unbia&s;&s;ed by inter|cour&s;e
with the world. He perceived, that
his opinions were formed, rather than im|bibed;
were more the re&s;ult of thought,
<PB N="131" REF="141">
than of learning. Of the world he &s;eemed
to know nothing; for he believed well of
all mankind, and this opinion gave him the
reflected image of his own heart.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, as he &s;ometimes lingered
to examine the wild plants in his path, often
looked forward with plea&s;ure to Emily and
Valancourt, as they &s;trolled on together; he,
with a countenance of animated delight,
pointing to her attention &s;ome grand &s;ea|ture
of the &s;cene; and &s;he, li&s;tening and ob|&s;erving
with a look of tender &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s,
that &s;poke the elevation of her mind. They
appeared like two lovers who had never
&s;trayed beyond the&s;e their native mountains;
who&s;e &s;ituation had &s;ecluded them from the
frivolities of common life, who&s;e ideas were
&s;imple and grand, like the land&s;capes among
which they moved, and who knew no other
happine&s;s, than in the union of pure and af|fectionate
hearts. St. Aubert &s;miled, and
&s;ighed at the romantic picture of felicity his
fancy drew; and &s;ighed again to think, that
nature and &s;implicity were &s;o little known
<PB N="132" REF="142">
to the world, as that their plea&s;ures were
thought romantic.</P>
<P>"The world," &s;aid he, pur&s;uing this train
of thought, "ridicules a pa&s;&s;ion which it
&s;eldom feels; its &s;cenes, and its intere&s;ts, di&s;|tract
the mind, deprave the ta&s;te, corrupt
the heart, and love cannot exi&s;t in a heart
that has lo&s;t the meek dignity of innocence,
Virtue and ta&s;te are nearly the lame, for
virtue is little more than active ta&s;te, and
the mo&s;t delicate affections of each com|bine
in real love. How then are we to look
for love in great cities, where &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,
di&s;&s;ipation, and in&s;incerity &s;upply the place
of tenderne&s;s, &s;implicity and truth?"</P>
<P>It was near noon, when the travellers,
having arrived at a piece of &s;teep and dan|gerous
road, alighted to walk. The road
wound up an a&s;cent, that was clothed with
wood, and, in&s;tead of following the carriage,
they entered the refre&s;hing. &s;hade. A dewy
coolne&s;s was diffu&s;ed upon the air, which,
with the bright verdure of turf, that grew
under the trees, the mingled fragrance of
<PB N="133" REF="143">
flowers and of balm, thyme, and lavender,
that enriched it, and the grandeur of the
pines, beech, and che&s;nuts, that over&s;hadow|ed
them, rendered this amo&s;t delicious re|treat.
Sometimes, the thick foliage exclud|ed
all view of the country; at others, it ad|mitted
&s;ome partial catches of the di&s;tant
&s;eenery, which gave hints to the imagina|tion
to picture, land&s;capes more interesting,
more impre&s;&s;ive, than any that had been
pre&s;ented to the eye. The wanderers often
lingered to indulge in the&s;e reveries of fancy.</P>
<P>The pau&s;es of &s;ilence, &s;uch as had former|ly
interrupted the conver&s;ations of Valan|court
and Emily, were more frequent to|day
than ever. Valancourt often dropped
&s;uddenly from the mo&s;t animating vivacity
into fits of deep mu&s;ing, and there was,
&s;ometimes, an unaffected melancholy in his
&s;mile, which Emily could not avoid under|&s;tanding,
for her heart was intere&s;ted in the
&s;entiment it &s;poke.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was refre&s;hed by the &s;hades,
and they continued to &s;aunter under them,
<PB N="134" REF="144">
following, as nearly as they could gue&s;s,
the direction of the road, till they perceived
that they had totally lo&s;t it. They had con|tinue
I near the brow of the precipice, allur|ed
by the &s;cenery it exhibited, while the road
wound far away over the cliff above. Va|lancourt
called loudly to Michael, but heard
no voice, except his own, echoing among
the rocks, and his various efforts to re|gain
the road were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful.
While they were thus circum&s;tanced, they
perceived a &s;hepherd's cabin, between the
boles of the trees at &s;ome di&s;tance, and Va|lancourt
bounded on fir&s;t to a&s;k a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
When he reached it, he &s;aw only two little
children, at play, on the turf before the door.
He looked into the hut, but no per&s;on was
there, and the, elde&s;t of the boys told him
that their father was with his &s;locks, and
their mother was gone down into the vale,
but would be back pre&s;ently. As he &s;tood,
considering what was further to be done, on
a &s;udden he heard Michael's voice roaring
forth mo&s;t manfully among the cliffs above,
<PB N="135" REF="145">
till he made their echoes ring. Valancourt
immediately an&s;wered the call, and endea|voured
to make his way through the thicket
that clothed the &s;teeps, following the di|rection
of the &s;ound. After much &s;truggle
over brambles and precipices, he reached
Michael, and at length prevailed with him
to be &s;ilent, and to li&s;ten to him. The road
was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;pot
where St. Aubert and Emily were; the car|riage
could not ea&s;ily return to the entrance
of the wood, and, &s;ince it would be very fa|tiguing
for St. Aubert to climb the long
and &s;teep road to the place where it now
&s;tood, Valancourt was anxious to find a
more ea&s;y a&s;cent, by the way he had him|&s;elf
pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily ap|proached
the cottage, and re&s;ted them&s;elves
on a ru&s;tic bench, &s;a&s;tened between two
pines, which over&s;hadowed it, till Valan|court,
who&s;e &s;teps they had ob&s;erved, &s;hould
return.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the children de&s;i&s;ted from
<PB N="136" REF="146">
his play, and &s;tood &s;till to ob&s;erve the
&s;trangers, while the younger continued his
little gambols, and tea&s;ed his brother to join
in them. St. Aubert looked with plea&s;ure
upon this picture of infantine &s;implicity,
till it brought to his remembrance his own
boys, whom he had lo&s;t about the age of
the&s;e, and their lamented, mother; and he
&s;unk into a thoughtfulne&s;s, which Emily
ob&s;erving, &s;he immediately began to &s;ing
one of tho&s;e &s;imple and lively airs he was &s;o
fond of, and which &s;he knew how to give
with the mo&s;t captivating &s;weetne&s;s St.
Aubert &s;miled on her through his tears,
took her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately,
and then tried to di&s;&s;ipate the melancholy
reflections that lingered in his mind.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;ung, Valancourt approached,
who was unwilling to interrupt her, and
pau&s;ed at a little di&s;tance to li&s;ten. When
&s;he had concluded, he joined the party, and
told them, that he had found Michael, as
well as a way, by which he thought they
could a&s;cend the cliff to the carriage. He
<PB N="137" REF="147">
pointed to the woody &s;teeps above, which
St. Aubert &s;urveyed with an anxious eye.
He was already wearied by his walk, and
this a&s;cent was formidable to him. He
thought, however, it would be le&s;s toil&s;ome
than the long and broken road, and he de|termined
to attempt it; but Emily, ever
watchful of his ea&s;e, propo&s;ing that he &s;hould
re&s;t, and dine before they proceeded further,
Valancourt went to the carriage for the re|fre&s;hments
depo&s;ited there.</P>
<P>On his return, he propo&s;ed removing a
little higher up the mountain, to where the
woods opened upon a grand and exten&s;ive
pro&s;pect; and thither they were preparing to
go, when they &s;aw a young woman join the
children, and care&s;s and weep over them.</P>
<P>The travellers, intere&s;ted by her di&s;tre&s;s,
&s;topped to ob&s;erve her. She took the young|e&s;t
of the children in her arms, and, perceiv|ing
the &s;trangers, ha&s;tily dried her tears, and
proceeded to the cottage, St. Aubert, on en|quiring
the occa&s;ion of her &s;orrow, learned
that her hu&s;band, who was &s;hepherd, and
<PB N="138" REF="148">
lived here in the &s;ummer months to watch
over the flocks he led to feed upon the&s;e
mountains, had lo&s;t, on the preceding
night, his little all. A gang of gip&s;ies,
who had for &s;ome time infe&s;ted the neigh|bourhood,
had driven away &s;everal of his
matter's &s;heep. "Jacques," added the &s;hep|herd's
wife, "had &s;aved a little money, and
had bought a few &s;heep with it, and now
they mu&s;t go to his ma&s;ter for tho&s;e that are
&s;tolen; and what is wor&s;e than all, his ma&s;|ter,
when he comes to know how it is, will
tru&s;t him no longer with the care of his
flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what
is to become of our children!"</P>
<P>The innocent countenance of the woman,
and the &s;implicity of her manner in relating
her grievance, inclined St. Aubert to believe
her &s;tory; and Valancourt, convinced that
it was true, a&s;ked eagerly what was the va|lue
of the &s;tolen &s;heep, on hearing which he
turned away with a look of di&s;appointment,
St. Aubert put &s;ome money into her hand,
Emily too gave &s;omething from her little
<PB N="139" REF="149">
pur&s;e, and they walked towards the cliff;
but Valancourt lingered behind, and &s;poke
to the &s;hepherd's wife, who was now weep|ing
with gratitude and &s;urpri&s;e. He en|quired
how much money was yet wanting
to replace the &s;tolen &s;heep, and found, that
it was a &s;um very little &s;hort of all he had
about him. He was perplexed and di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed.
"This &s;um then," &s;aid he to him&s;elf,
"would make this poor family completely
happy&mdash;it is in my power to give it&mdash;to
make them completely happy! But what
is to become of me?&mdash;how &s;hall I contrive
to reach home with the little money that
will remain?" For a moment he &s;tood,
unwilling to forego the luxury of rai&s;ing a
family from ruin to happine&s;s, yet con|&s;idering
the difficulties of pur&s;uing his
journey with &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as would be
left.</P>
<P>While he was in this &s;tate of perplexity,
the &s;hepherd him&s;elf appeared: his children
ran to meet him; he took one of them in
his arms, and, with the other clinging to
<PB N="140" REF="150">
his coat, came forward with a loitering &s;tep.
His forlorn and melancholy look determin|ed
Valancourt at once; he threw down all
the money he had, except a very few louis,
and bounded away after St. Aubert and
Emily, who were proceeding &s;lowly up the
&s;teep. Valancourt had &s;eldom felt his heart
&s;o light as at this moment; his gay &s;pirits
danced with plea&s;ure; every object around
him appeared more intere&s;ting, or beautiful,
than before. St. Aubert ob&s;erved the un|common
vivacity of his countenance:
"What has plea&s;ed you &s;o much?" &s;aid he.
"O what a lovely day," replied Valancourt,
"how brightly the &s;un &s;hines, how pure is
this air, what enchanting &s;cenery!" "It
is indeed enchanting," &s;aid St. Aubert,
whom early experience had taught to under|&s;tand
the nature of Valancourt's pre&s;ent
feelings. "What pity that the wealthy,
who can command &s;uch &s;un&s;hine, &s;hould
ever pa&s;s their days in gloom&mdash;in the cold
&s;hade of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s! For you, my young
friend, may the &s;un always &s;hine as bright|ly
<PB N="141" REF="151">
as at this moment; may your own con|duct
always give you the &s;un&s;hine of bene|volence
and rea&s;on united!"</P>
<P>Valanc&oacute;urt, highly flattered by this com|pliment,
could make no reply but by a &s;mile
of gratitude.</P>
<P>They continued to wind under the woods,
between the gra&s;&s;y knolls of the mountain, and,
as they reached the &s;hady &s;ummit, which he
had pointed out, the whole party bur&s;t in|to
an exclamation. Behind the &s;pot where
they &s;tood, the rock ro&s;e perpendicularly in
a ma&s;&s;y wall to a con&s;iderable height, and
then branched out into overhanging crags.
Their grey tints were well contra&s;ted by the
bright hues of the plants and wild flowers,
that grew in their fractured &s;ides, and were
deepened by the gloom of the pines and cedars,
that waved above. The &s;teeps below, over
which the eye pa&s;&s;ed abruptly to the valley,
were fringed with thickets of alpine &s;hrubs;
and, lower &s;till, appeared the tufted tops of
the che&s;nut woods, that clothed their ba&s;e,
among which peeped forth the &s;hepherd's
<PB N="142" REF="152">
cottage, ju&s;t left by the travellers, with its
bluei&s;h &s;moke curling high in the air. On
every &s;ide appeared the maje&s;tic &s;ummits
of the Pyren&eacute;es, &s;ome exhibiting tremen|dous
crags of marble, who&s;e appearance was
changing every in&s;tant, as the varying lights
fell upon their &s;urface; others, &s;till high|er,
di&s;playing only &s;nowy points, while
their lower &s;teeps were covered almo&s;t in|variably
with fore&s;ts of pine, larch, and oak,
that &s;tretched down to the vale. This was
one of the narrow vallies, that open from the
Pyren&eacute;es into the country of Rou&s;illon, and
who&s;e green pa&s;tures, and cultivated beauty,
form a decided and wonderful contra&s;t to
the romantic grandeur that environs it.
Through a vi&s;ta of the mountains appear|ed
the lowlands of Rou&s;illon, tinted with
the blue haze of di&s;tance, as they united with
the waters of the Mediterranean; where, on
a promontory, which marked the boundary
of the &s;hore, &s;tood a lonely beacon, over
which were &s;een circling flights of &s;ea-fowl.
Beyond, appeared, now and then, a &s;tealing
<PB N="143" REF="153">
&s;ail, white with the &s;un-beam, and who&s;e
progre&s;s was perceivable by its approach to
the light-hou&s;e. Sometimes, too, was &s;een
a &s;ail &s;o di&s;tant, that it &s;erved only to mark
the line of &s;eparation between the &s;ky and
the waves.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the valley, imme|diately,
oppo&s;ite to the &s;pot where the tra|vellers
re&s;ted, a rocky pa&s;s opened toward
Ga&s;cony. Here no &s;ign of cultivation ap|peared.
The rocks of granite, that &s;creen|ed
the glen, ro&s;e abruptly from their ba&s;e,
and &s;tretched their barren points to the
clouds, unvaried with woods, and uncheered
even by a hunter's cabin. Sometimes, indeed,
a gigantic larch threw its long &s;hade over the
precipice, and here and there a cliff rear|ed
on its brow a monumental cro&s;s, to tell
the traveller the fate of him who had ventur|ed
thither before. This &s;pot &s;eemed the very
haunt of banditti; and Emily, as &s;he look|ed
down upon it, almo&s;t expected to &s;ee them
&s;tealing out from &s;ome hollow cave to look
for their prey. Soon after an object not le&s;s
<PB N="144" REF="154">
terrific &s;truck her,&mdash;a gibbet &s;tanding on a
point of rock near the entrance of the pa&s;s,
and immediately over one of the cro&s;&s;es &s;he
had before ob&s;erved. The&s;e were hiero|glyphics
that told a plain arid dreadful
&s;tory. She forbore to point it out to St.
Aubert, but it threw a gloom over her &s;pi|rits,
and made her anxious to ha&s;ten for|ward,
that they might with certainty
reach Rou&s;illon before night-fall. It was
nece&s;&s;ary, however, that St. Aubert &s;hould
take &s;ome refre&s;hment, and, &s;eating them|&s;elves
on the &s;hort dry turf, they opened the
ba&s;ket of provi&s;ions, while</P>

<P>St. Aubert was revived by re&s;t, and by
the &s;erene air of this &s;ummit; and Valan|court
<PB N="145" REF="155">
was &s;o charmed with all around, and
with the conver&s;ation of his companions,
that he &s;eemed to have forgotten he had
any further to go. Having concluded their
&s;imple repa&s;t, they gave a long farewell look
to the &s;cene, and again began to a&s;cend.
St. Aubert rejoiced when he reached the
carriage, which Emily entered with him;
but Valancourt, willing to take a more ex|ten&s;ive
view of the enchanting country, in|to
which they were about to de&s;cend, than
he could do from a carriage, loo&s;ened his
dogs, and once more bounded with them
along the banks of the road. He often
quitted it for points that promi&s;ed a wider
pro&s;pect, and the &s;low pace, at which the
mules travelled, allowed him to overtake
them with ea&s;e. Whenever a &s;cene of un|common
magnificence appeared, he ha&s;ten|ed
to inform St. Aubert, who, though he
was too much tired to walk him&s;elf, &s;ome|times
made the chai&s;e wait, while Emily
went to the neighbouring cliff.</P>
<P>It was evening when they de&s;cended the
<PB N="146" REF="156">
lower alps, that bind Rou&s;illon, and form a
maje&s;tic barrier round that charming coun|try,
leaving it open only on the ea&s;t to the
Mediterranean. The gay tints of cultiva|tion
once more beautified the land&s;cape;
for the lowlands were coloured with the
riche&s;t hues, which a luxuriant climate, and
an indu&s;trious people can awaken into life.
Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the
air, their ripe fruit glowing among the fo|liage;
while, &s;loping to the plains, exten|&s;ive
vineyards &s;pread their trea&s;ures. Be|yond
the&s;e, woods and pa&s;tures, and min|gled
towns and hamlets &s;tretched towards
the &s;ea, on who&s;e bright &s;urface gleamed
many a di&s;tant &s;ail; while, over the whole
&s;cene, was diffu&s;ed the purple glow of even|ing.
This land&s;cape with the &s;urrounding
alps did, indeed, pre&s;ent a perfect picture
of the lovely and the &s;ublime, of "beauty
&s;leeping in the lap of horror."</P>
<P>The travellers, having reached the plains,
proceeded, between hedges of flowering
myrtle and pomegranate, to the town of
<PB N="147" REF="157">
Arles, where they purpo&s;ed to re&s;t for the
night. They met with &s;imple, but neat ac|commodation,
and would have pa&s;&s;ed an
happy evening, after the toils and the de|lights
of this day, had not the approaching
&s;eparation thrown a gloom over their &s;pi|rits.
It was St. Aubert's plan to proceed,
on the morrow, to the borders of the Me|diterranean,
and travel along its &s;hores
into Languedoc; and Valancourt, &s;ince he
was now nearly recovered, and had no longer
a pretence for continuing with his new
friends, re&s;olved to leave them here. St.
Aubert, who was much plea&s;ed with him,
invited him to go further, but did not re|peat
the invitation, and Valancourt had re|&s;olution
enough to forego the temptation
of accepting it, that he might prove him|&s;elf
not unworthy of the favour. On the
following morning, therefore, they were to
part, St. Aubert to pur&s;ue his way to Lan|guedoc,
and Valancourt to explore new
&s;cenes among the mountains, on his return
home. During this evening he was often
<PB N="148" REF="158">
&s;ilent and thoughtful; St. Aubert's manner
towards him was affectionate, though grave,
and Emily was &s;erious, though &s;he made
frequent efforts to appear cheerful. After
one of the mo&s;t melancholy evenings they
had yet pa&s;&s;ed together, they &s;eparated for
the night.</P>

<P>IN the morning, Valancourt breakfa&s;ted
with St. Aubert and Emily, neither of
whom &s;eemed much refre&s;hed by &s;leep.
The languor of illne&s;s &s;till hung over St.
Aubert, and to Emily's fears his di&s;order
appeared to be increa&s;ing fa&s;t upon him.
She watched his looks with anxious affect|tion,
and their expre&s;&s;ion was always faith|fully
reflected in her own.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="160">
At the commencement of their acquaint|ance,
Valancourt had made known his
name and family. St. Aubert was not a
&s;tranger to either, for the family e&s;tates,
which were now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an elder
brother of Valancourt, were little more than
twenty miles di&s;tant from La Vall&eacute;e, and
he had &s;ometimes met the elder Valancourt
on vi&s;its in the neighbourhood. This
knowledge had made him more willingly re|ceive
his pre&s;ent companion; for, though his
countenance and manners would have won
him the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who
was very apt to tru&s;t to the intelligence of
his own eyes, with re&s;pect to countenances,
he would not have accepted the&s;e, as &s;uffi|cient
introductions to that of his daughter.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t was almo&s;t as &s;ilent as the
&s;upper of the preceding night; but their
mu&s;ing was at length interrupted by the
&s;ound of the carriage-wheels, which were to
bear away St. Aubert and Emily. Valan|court
&s;tarted from his chair, and went to the
window; it was indeed the carriage, and
<PB N="151" REF="161">
he returned to, his &s;eat without &s;peaking.
The moment was now come when they
mu&s;t part. St. Aubert told Valancourt,
that he hoped he would never pa&s;s La Val|l&eacute;e
without favouring him with a vi&s;it;
and Valancourt, eagerly thanking him, a&s;|&s;ured
him that he never would; as he &s;aid
which he looked timidly at Emily, who
tried to &s;mile away the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of her
&s;pirits. They pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes in in|tere&s;ting
conver&s;ation, and St. Aubert then
led the way to the carriage, Emily and Va|lancourt
following in &s;ilence. The latter
lingered at the door &s;everal minutes after
they were &s;eated, and none of the party &s;eemed
to have courage enough to &s;ay&mdash;Farewell. At
length, St. Aubert pronounced the melan|choly
word, which Emily pa&s;&s;ed to Valan|court,
who returned it, with a dejected
&s;mile, and the carriage drove on.</P>
<P>The travellers remained, for &s;ome time,
in a &s;tate of tranquil pen&s;ivene&s;s, which is
not unplea&s;ing. St. Aubert interrupted it
by ob&s;erving, "This is a very promi&s;ing
<PB N="152" REF="162">
young man; it is many years &s;ince I have
been &s;o much plea&s;ed with any per&s;on, on
&s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. He brings back
to my memory the days of my youth, when
every &s;cene was new and delightful!" St.
Aubert &s;ighed, and &s;unk again into a reve|rie;
and, as Emily looked back upon the
road they had pa&s;&s;ed, Valancourt was &s;een,
at the door of the little inn, following them
with his eyes. He perceived her, and
waved his hand; and &s;he returned the
adieu, till the winding road &s;hut her from,
his &s;ight.</P>
<P>"I remember when I was about his age,"
re&s;umed St. Aubert, "and I thought, and
felt exactly as he does. The world was
opening upon me then, now&mdash;it is clo&s;ing."</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir, do not think &s;o gloomily,"
&s;aid Emily in a trembling voice, "I hope
you have many, many years to live&mdash;for
your own &s;ake&mdash;for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake."</P>
<P>"Ah, my Emily!" replied St. Aubert,
"for thy &s;ake! Well&mdash;I hope it is &s;o."
He wiped away a tear, that was &s;tealing
<PB N="153" REF="163">
down his cheek, threw a &s;mile upon his
countenance, and &s;aid in a cheering voice,
"There is &s;omething in the ardour and in|genuou&s;ne&s;s
of youth, which is particularly
plea&s;ing to the contemplation of an old
man, if his feelings have not been entirely
corroded by the world. It is cheering and
reviving, like the view of &s;pring to a &s;ick
per&s;on; his mind catches &s;omewhat of the
&s;pirit of the &s;ea&s;on, and his eyes are lighted
up with a tran&s;ient &s;un&s;hine. Valancourt
is this &s;pring to me."</P>
<P>Emily, who pre&s;&s;ed her father's hand af|fectionately,
had never before li&s;tened with
&s;o much plea&s;ure to the prai&s;es he be&s;tow|ed;
no, not even when he had be&s;towed
them on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>They travelled on, among vineyards,
woods, and pa&s;tures, delighted with the
romantic beauty of the land&s;cape, which
was bounded, on one &s;ide, by the grandeur
of the Pyren&eacute;es, and, on the other, by the
ocean; and, &s;oon after noon, they reached,
the town of Colioure, &s;ituated on the Me|diterranean.
<PB N="154" REF="164">
Here they dined, and re&s;ted
till towards the cool of day, when they
pur&s;ued their way along the &s;hores&mdash;tho&s;e
enchanting &s;hores! which extend to Lan|guedoc.
Emily gazed with enthu&s;ia&s;m on
the va&s;tne&s;s of the &s;ea, its &s;urface varying,
as the lights and &s;hadows fell, and on its
woody banks, mellowed with autumnal
tints.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was impatient to reach Per|pignan,
where he expected letters from M.
Que&s;nel; and it was the expectation of
the&s;e letters, that had induced him to leave
Colioure, for his feeble frame had required
immediate re&s;t. After travelling a few
miles, he fell a&s;leep; and Emily, who had
put two or three books into the carriage, on
leaving La Vall&eacute;e, had now the lei&s;ure
for looking into them. She &s;ought for one,
in which Valancourt had been reading the
day before, and hoped for the plea&s;ure of
re-tracing a page, over which the eyes of a
beloved friend had lately pa&s;&s;ed, of dwell|ing
on the pa&s;&s;ages, which he had admired,
<PB N="155" REF="165">
and of permitting them to &s;peak to her in
the language of his own mind, and to bring
him&s;elf to her pre&s;ence. On &s;earching for
the book, &s;he could find it no where, but in
its &s;tead perceived a volume of Petrarch's
poems, that had belonged to Valancourt,
who&s;e name was written in it, and from
which he had frequently read pa&s;&s;ages to
her, with all the pathetic expre&s;&s;ion, that
characterized the feelings of the author.
She he&s;itated in believing, what would have
been &s;ufficiently apparent to almo&s;t any
other per&s;on, that he had purpo&s;ely left,
this book, in&s;tead of the one &s;he had lo&s;t,
and that love had prompted the exchange;
but, having opened it with impatient plea|&s;ure,
and ob&s;erved the lines of his pencil
drawn along the various pa&s;&s;ages he had
read aloud, and under others more de&s;crip|tive
of delicate tenderne&s;s than he had dared
to tru&s;t his voice with, the conviction came,
at length, to her mind. For &s;ome moments
&s;he was con&s;cious only of being beloved;
then, a recollection of all the variations of
<PB N="156" REF="166">
tone and countenance, with which he had
recited the&s;e &s;onnets, and of the &s;oul, which
&s;poke in their expree&s;&s;ion, pre&s;&s;ed to her me|mory,
and &s;he wept over the memorial of
his affection.</P>
<P>They arrived at Perpignan &s;oon after &s;un|&s;et,
where St. Aubert found, as he had ex|pected,
letters from M. Que&s;nel, the contents
of which &s;o evidently and grievou&s;ly affected
him, that Emily was alarmed, and pre&s;&s;ed
him, as far as her delicacy would permit, to
di&s;clo&s;e the occa&s;ion of his concern; but he
an&s;wered her only by tears, and immedi|ately
began to talk on other topics. Emily,
though &s;he forbore to pre&s;s the one mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting
to her, was greatly affected by her
father's manner, and pa&s;&s;ed a night of &s;leep|le&s;s
&s;olicitude.</P>
<P>In the morning they pur&s;ued their jour|ney
along the coa&s;t towards Leucate, ano|ther
town on the Mediterranean, &s;ituated
on the borders of Languedoc and Rou|&s;illon.
On the way, Emily renewed the
&s;ubject of the preceding night, and ap|peared
<PB N="157" REF="167">
&s;o deeply affected by St. Aubert's
&s;ilence and dejection, that he relaxed from
his re&s;erve. "I was unwilling, my dear
Emily," &s;aid he, "to throw a cloud over
the plea&s;ure you receive from the&s;e &s;cenes,
and meant, therefore, to conceal, for the
pre&s;ent, &s;ome circum&s;tances, with which,
however, you mu&s;t at length have been
made acquainted. But your anxiety has
defeated my purpo&s;e; you &s;uffer as much
from this, perhaps, as you will do from a
knowledge of the facts I have to relate.
M. Que&s;nel's vi&s;it proved an unhappy one
to me; he came to tell me a part of the
news he has now confirmed. You may
have heard me mention an M. Motteville,
of Paris, but you did not know that the
chief of my per&s;onal property was inve&s;ted
in his hands. I had great confidence in
him, and I am yet willing to believe, that
he is not wholly unworthy of my e&s;teem.
A variety of circum&s;tances have concurred
to ruin him, and&mdash;I am ruined with him."</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="168">
St. Aubert pau&s;ed, to conceal his emo|tion.</P>
<P>"The letters I have ju&s;t received from
M. Que&s;nel," re&s;umed he, &s;truggling to
&s;peak with firmne&s;s "enclo&s;ed others
from Motteville, which confirmed all I
dreaded."</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t we then quit La Vall&eacute;e?" &s;aid
Emily, after a long pau&s;e of &s;ilence. "That
is yet uncertain," replied St. Aubert, "it
will depend upon the compromi&s;e Motte|ville
is able to make with his creditors.
My income, you know, was never large,
and now it will be reduced to little indeed!
It is for you, Emily, for you, my child,
that I am mo&s;t afflicted." His la&s;t words
faltered; Emily &s;miled tenderly upon him
through her tears, and then, endeavouring
to overcome her emotion, "My dear fa|ther,"
&s;aid &s;he, "do not grieve for me, or
for your&s;elf; we may yet be happy;&mdash;if
La Vall&eacute;e remains for us, we mu&s;t be
happy. We will retain only one &s;ervant,
and you &s;hall &s;carcely perceive the change
<PB N="159" REF="169">
in your income. Be comforted, my dear
&s;ir; we &s;hall not-feel the want of tho&s;e
luxuries, which others value &s;o highly,
&s;ince we never had a ta&s;te for them; and
poverty cannot deprive us of many con&s;o|lations.
It cannot rob us of the affection
we have for each other, or degrade us in
our own opinion, or in that of any per&s;on,
who&s;e opinion we ought to value."</P>
<P>St. Aubert concealed his face with his
handkerchief, and was unable to &s;peak;
but Emily continued to urge to her father
the truths, which him&s;elf had impre&s;&s;ed
upon her mind.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, my dear &s;ir, poverty cannot
deprive us of intellectual delights. It can|not
deprive you of the comfort of affording
me examples of fortitude and benevolence;
nor me of the delight of con&s;oling a beloved
parent. It cannot deaden our ta&s;te for the
grand, and the beautiful, or deny us the
means of indulging it; for the &s;cenes of na|ture&mdash;tho&s;e
&s;ublime &s;pectacles, &s;o infinitely
&s;uperior to all artificial luxuries! are open
<PB N="160" REF="170">
for the enjoyment of the poor, as well as of
the rich. Of what, then, have we to complain,
&s;o long as we are not in want of nece&s;&s;aries?
Plea&s;ures, &s;uch as wealth cannot buy, will
&s;till be ours. We retain, then, the &s;ublime
luxuries of nature, and lo&s;e only the frivo|lous
ones of art."</P>
<P>St. Aubert could not reply: he caught
Emily to his bo&s;om, their tears flowed to|gether,
but&mdash;they were not tears of &s;orrow.
After this language of the heart, all other
would have been feeble, and they remained
&s;ilent for &s;ome time. Then, St. Aubert
conver&s;ed as before; for, if his mind had
not recovered its natural tranquillity, it at
lea&s;t a&s;&s;umed the appearance of it.</P>
<P>They reached the romantic town of Leu|cate
early in the day, but St. Aubert was
weary, and they determined to pa&s;s the
night there. In the evening, he exerted him|&s;elf
&s;o far as to walk with his daughter to
view the environs that overlook the lake of
Leucate, the Mediterranean, part of Rou|&s;illon,
<PB N="161" REF="171">
with the Pyren&eacute;es, and a wide extent
of the luxuriant province of Languedoc,
now blu&s;hing with the ripened vintage,
which the pea&s;ants were beginning to ga|ther.
St. Aubert and Emily &s;aw the bu&s;y
groups, caught the joyous &s;ong, that was
wa&s;ted on the breeze, and anticipated, with
apparent plea&s;ure, their next day's journey
over this gay region. He de&s;igned, howe|ver,
&s;till to wind along the &s;ea-&s;hore. To
return home immediately was partly his
wi&s;h, but from this he was with-held by a
de&s;ire to lengthen the plea&s;ure, which the
journey gave his daughter, and to try the
effect of the &s;ea air on his own di&s;order.</P>
<P>On the following day, therefore, they re|commenced
their journey through Lan|guedoc,
winding the &s;hores of the Mediter|ranean;
the Pyren&eacute;es &s;till forming the mag|nificent
back-ground of their pro&s;pects,
while on their right was the ocean, and, on
their left, wide extended plains melting
into the blue horizon. St. Aubert was
plea&s;ed, and conver&s;ed much with Emily,
<PB N="162" REF="172">
yet his cheerfulne&s;s was &s;ometimes artificial,
and &s;ometimes a &s;hade of melancholy would
&s;teal upon his countenance, and betray him.
This was &s;oon cha&s;ed away by Emily's
&s;mile, who &s;miled, however, with an aching
heart, for &s;he &s;aw that his misfortunes preyed
upon his mind, and upon his enfeebled
frame.</P>
<P>It was evening when they reached a &s;mall
village of Upper Languedoc, where they
meant to pa&s;&s; the night, but the place could
not afford them beds; for here, too, it was
the time of the vintage, and they were
obliged to proceed to the next po&s;t. The
languor of illne&s;s and of fatigue, which re|turned
upon St. Aubert, required imme|diate
repo&s;e, and the evening was now far
advanced; but from nece&s;&s;ity there was no
appeal, and he ordered Michael to pro|ceed.</P>
<P>The rich plains of Languedoc, which ex|hibited
all the glories of the vintage, with
the gaieties of a French fe&s;tival, no longer
awakened St. Aubert to plea&s;ure, who&s;e
<PB N="163" REF="173">
condition formed a mournful contra&s;t to the
hilarity and youthful beauty which &s;ur|rounded
him. As his languid eyes moved
over the &s;cene, he con&s;idered, that they
would &s;oon, perhaps, be clo&s;ed for ever on
this world. "Tho&s;e di&s;tant and &s;ublime
mountains," &s;aid he &s;ecretly, as he gazed
on a chain of the Pyren&eacute;es that &s;tretched
towards the we&s;t, "the&s;e luxuriant plains,
this blue vault, the cheerful light of day,
will be &s;hut from my eyes! The &s;ong
of the pea&s;ant, the cheering voice of man&mdash;will
no longer &s;ound for me!"</P>
<P>The intelligent eyes of Emily &s;eemed to
read what pa&s;&s;ed in the mind of her father,
and &s;he fixed them on his face, with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch tender pity, as recalled
his thoughts from every de&s;ultory object of
regret, and he remembered only, that he
mu&s;t leave his daughter without protection.
This reflection changed regret to agony;
he &s;ighed deeply, and remained &s;ilent, while
&s;he &s;eemed to under&s;tand that &s;igh, for &s;he
<PB N="164" REF="174">
pre&s;&s;ed his hand affectionately, and then
turned to the window to conceal her tears.
The &s;un now threw a la&s;t yellow gleam on the
waves of the Mediterranean, and the gloom
of twilight &s;pread fa&s;t over the &s;cene, till
only a melancholy ray appeared on the
we&s;tern horizon, marking the point where
the &s;un had &s;et amid the vapours of an au|tumnal
evening. A cool breeze now came
from the &s;nore, and Emily let down the
gla&s;s; but the air, which was refre&s;hing
to health, was as chilling to &s;ickne&s;s, and
St. Aubert de&s;ired, that the window might
be drawn up. Increa&s;ing illne&s;s made him
now more anxious than ever to fini&s;h the
day's journey, and he &s;topped the muleteer
to enquire how far they had yet to go to the
next po&s;t. He replied, Nine miles. "I
feel I am unable to proceed much further,"
&s;aid St. Aubert; "enquire, as you go, if
there is any hou&s;e on the road that would ac|commodate
us for the night." He &s;unk
back in the carriage, and Michael, crack|ing
his whip in the air, &s;et off, and continued
<PB N="165" REF="175">
on the full gallop, till St. Aubert, almo&s;t
fainting, called to him to &s;top. Emily looked
anxiou&s;ly from the window, and &s;aw a pea|&s;ant
walking at &s;ome little di&s;tance on the
road, for whom they waited, till he came
up, when he was a&s;ked, if there was any
hou&s;e in the neighbourhood that accommo|dated
travellers. He replied, that he knew
of none. "There is a chateau, indeed,
among tho&s;e woods on the right," added
he, "but I believe it receives nobody, and
I cannot &s;hew you the way, for I am almo&s;t
a &s;tranger here." St. Aubert was going
to a&s;k him &s;ome further que&s;tion concern|ing
the chateau, but the man abruptly pa&s;&s;ed
on. After &s;ome con&s;ideration, he ordered
Michael to proceed &s;lowly to the woods.
Every moment now deepened the twilight,
and increa&s;ed the difficulty of finding the
road. Another pea&s;ant &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed.
"Which is the way to the chateau in the
woods?" cried Michael.</P>
<P>"The chateau in the woods!" exclaimed
<PB N="166" REF="176">
the pea&s;ant, "Do you mean that, with the
turret, yonder?"</P>
<P>"I don't know as for the turret, as you
call it," &s;aid Michael, "I mean that white
piece of a building, that we &s;ee at a di&s;tance
there, among the trees."</P>
<P>"Yes, that is the turret; why, who are
you, that you are going thither?" &s;aid the
man with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, on hearing this odd que&s;tion,
and ob&s;erving the peculiar tone in which it
was delivered, looked out from the car|riage.
"We are travellers," &s;aid he, "who
are in &s;earch of a hou&s;e of accommodation
for the night; is there any hereabout?"</P>
<P>"None, Mon&s;ieur, unle&s;s you have a
mind to try your luck yonder," replied the
pea&s;ant, pointing to the woods, "but I
would not advi&s;e you to go there."</P>
<P>"To whom does the chateau belong?"</P>
<P>"I &s;carcely know my&s;elf, Mon&s;ieur."</P>
<P>"It is uninhabited, then." "No, not
uninhabited; the &s;teward and hou&s;ekeeper
are there, I believe."</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="177">
On hearing this, St. Aubert determined
to proceed to the chateau, and ri&s;que the re|fu&s;al
of being accommodated for the night;
he therefore de&s;ired the countryman would
&s;hew Michael the way, and bade him expert
reward for his trouble. The man was for
a moment &s;ilent, and then &s;aid, that he was
going on other bu&s;ine&s;s, but that the road
could not be mi&s;&s;ed, if they went up an
avenue to the right, to which he pointed.
St. Aubert was going to &s;peak, but the
pea&s;ant wi&s;hed him good night, and walked
on.</P>
<P>The carriage now moved towards the
avenue, which was guarded by a gate, and
Michael having di&s;mounted to open it,
they entered between rows of antient oak
and che&s;nut, who&s;e intermingled branches
formed a lofty arch above. There was
&s;omething &s;o gloomy and de&s;olate in the
appearance of this avenue, and its lonely
&s;ilence, that Emily almo&s;t &s;huddered as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed along; and, recollecting the manner
in which the pea&s;ant had mentioned the
<PB N="168" REF="178">
chateau, &s;he gave a my&s;terious meaning to
his words, &s;uch as &s;he had not &s;u&s;pected
when he uttered them. The&s;e apprehen|&s;ions,
however, &s;he tried to check, con&s;i|dering
that they were probably the effect of
a melancholy imagination, which her fa|ther's
&s;ituation, and a con&s;ederation of her
own circum&s;tances, had made &s;en&s;ible to
every impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly on, for they were now
almo&s;t in darkne&s;s, which, together with the
unevenne&s;s of the ground, and the frequent
roots of old trees, that &s;hot up above the
&s;oil, made it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with cau|tion.
On a &s;udden Michael &s;topped the
carriage; and, as St. Aubert looked from
the window to enquire the cau&s;e, he per|ceived
a figure at &s;ome di&s;tance moving up
the avenue. The du&s;k would not permit
him to di&s;tingui&s;h what it was, but he bade
Michael go on.</P>
<P>"This &s;eems a &s;trange wild place," &s;aid
Michael; "there is no hou&s;e hereabout,
<PB N="169" REF="179">
don't your honour think we had better turn
back?"</P>
<P>"Go a little further, and if we &s;ee no
hou&s;e then, we will return to the road,"
replied St. Aubert.</P>
<P>Michael proceeded with reluctance,
and the extreme &s;lowne&s;s of his pace made
St. Aubert look again from the window to
ha&s;ten him, when again he &s;aw the &s;ame
figure. He was &s;omewhat &s;tartled: proba|bly
the gloomine&s;s of the &s;pot made him
more liable to alarm than u&s;ual; however
this might be, he now &s;topped Michael, and
bade him call to the per&s;on in the avenue.</P>
<P>"Plea&s;e your honour, he may be a rob|ber,"
&s;aid Michael. "It does not plea&s;e
me," replied St. Aubert, who could not for|bear
&s;miling at the &s;implicity of his phra&s;e,
"and we will, therefore, return to the road,
for I &s;ee no probability of meeting here
with what we &s;eek."</P>
<P>Michael turned about immediately, and
was retracing his way with alacrity, when a
voice was heard from among the trees on
<PB N="170" REF="180">
the left. It was not the voice of command,
or di&s;tre&s;s, but a deep hollow tone, which
&s;eemed to be &s;carcely human. The man
whipped his mules till they went as fa&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible, regardle&s;s of the darkne&s;s, the
broken ground, and the necks of the whole
party, nor once &s;topped till he reached the
gate, which opened from the avenue into
the high-road, where he went into a more
moderate pace.</P>
<P>"I am very ill," &s;aid St. Aubert, taking
his daughter's hand. "You are wor&s;e,
then, &s;ir!" &s;aid Emily, extremely alarmed
by his manner, "you are wor&s;e, and here is
no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Good God! what is to be
done!" He leaned his head on her
&s;houlder, while &s;he endeavoured to &s;upport
him with her arm, and Michael was again
ordered to &s;top. When the rattling of the
wheels had cea&s;ed, mu&s;ic was heard on the
air; it was to Emily the voice of Hope.
"Oh! we are near &s;ome human habitation!"
&s;aid &s;he, "help may &s;oon be had."</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="181">
She li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly; the &s;ounds were
di&s;tant, and &s;eemed to come from a remote
part of the woods that bordered the road;
and, as &s;he looked towards the &s;pot whence
they i&s;&s;ued, &s;he perceived in the faint
moon-light &s;omething like a chateau. It
was difficult, however, to reach this; St.
Aubert was now too ill to bear the mo|tion
of the carriage; Michael could not
quit his mules; and Emily, who &s;till &s;up|ported
her father, feared to leave him, and
al&s;o feared to venture alone to &s;uch a di&s;|tance,
&s;he knew not whither, or to whom.
Something, however, it was nece&s;&s;ary to de|termine
upon immediately; St. Aubert,
therefore, told Michael to proceed &s;lowly;
but they, had not gone far, when he fainted,
and the carriage was again &s;topped. He
lay quite &s;en&s;ele&s;s.&mdash;"My dear, dear fa|ther,"
cried Emily in great agony, and who
began to fear that he was dying, "&s;peak,
if it is only one word to let me hear the
&s;ound of your voice!" But no voice &s;poke
in reply. In an agony of terror &s;he bade
<PB N="172" REF="182">
Michael bring water from the rivulet, that
flowed along the road; and, having received
&s;ome in the man's hat, with trembling hands
&s;he &s;prinkled it over her father's face, which,
as the moon's rays now fell upon it, &s;eemed
to bear the impre&s;&s;ion of death. Every emo|tion
of &s;elfi&s;h fear now gave way to a &s;trong|er
influence, and, committing St. Aubert to
the care of Michael, who refu&s;ed to go far
from his mules, &s;he &s;tepped from the car|riage
in &s;earch of the chateau &s;he had &s;een
at a di&s;tance. It was a &s;till moon-light
night, and the mu&s;ic, which yet &s;ounded on
the air, directed her &s;teps from the high
road, up a &s;hadowy lane, that led to the
woods. Her mind was for &s;ome time &s;o en|tirely
occupied by anxiety and terror for
her father, that &s;he felt none for her&s;elf, till
the deepening gloom of the overhanging fo|liage,
which now wholly excluded the moon|light,
and the wildne&s;s of the place, re|called
her to a &s;en&s;e of her adventurous
&s;ituation. The mu&s;ic had cea&s;ed, and &s;he
had no guide but chance. For a moment
<PB N="173" REF="183">
&s;he pau&s;ed in terrified perplexity, till a &s;en&s;e
of her father's condition again overcoming
every consideration for her&s;elf, &s;he proceed|ed.
The lane terminated in the woods, but
&s;he looked round in vain for a hou&s;e, or a
human being, and as vainly li&s;tened for a
&s;ound to guide her. She hurried on, how|ever,
not knowing whither, avoiding the
rece&s;&s;es of the woods, and endeavouring to
keep along their margin, till a rude kind of
avenue, which opened upon a moon-light
&s;pot, arre&s;ted her attention. The wildne&s;s
of this avenue brought to her recollection
the one leading to the turreted chateau, and
&s;he was inclined to believe, that this was a
part of the &s;ame domain, and probably led to
the &s;ame point. While &s;he he&s;itated, whether
to follow it or not, a &s;ound of many voices in
loud merriment bur&s;t upon her ear. It &s;eemed
not the laugh of cheerfulne&s;s, but of riot,
and &s;he &s;tood appalled. While &s;he pau&s;ed,
&s;he heard a di&s;tant voice, calling from the
way &s;he had come, and, not doubting but
it was that of Michael, her fir&s;t impul&s;e
<PB N="174" REF="184">
was to ha&s;ten back; but a &s;econd thought
changed her purpo&s;e; &s;he believed that no|thing
le&s;s than the la&s;t extremity could have
prevailed with Michael to quit his mules, and
fearing that her father was now dying, &s;he
ru&s;hed forward, with a feeble hope of ob|taining
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the people in the
woods. Her heart beat with fearful expecta|tion,
as &s;he drew near the &s;pot whence the
voices i&s;&s;ued, and &s;he often &s;tartled when
her &s;teps di&s;turbed the fallen leaves. The
&s;ounds led her towards the moon-light glade
&s;he had before noticed; at a little di&s;tance
from which &s;he &s;topped, and &s;aw, between
the boles of the trees, a &s;mall circular level
of green turf, &s;urrounded by the woods,
on which appeared a group of figures.
On drawing nearer, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e,
by their dre&s;s, to be pea&s;ants, and perceived
&s;everal cottages &s;cattered round the edge of
the woods, which waved loftily over this
&s;pot. While &s;he gazed, and endeavoured
to overcome the apprehen&s;ions that with|held
her &s;teps, &s;everal pea&s;ant girls came
<PB N="175" REF="185">
out of a cottage; mu&s;ic in&s;tantly &s;truck up,
and the dance began. It was the joyous
mu&s;ic of the vintage! the &s;ame &s;he had be|fore
heard upon the air. Her heart, occu|pied
with terror for her father, could not
feel the contra&s;t, which this gay &s;cene offer|ed
to her own di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he &s;tepped ha&s;tily
forward towards a group of elder pea&s;ants,
who were &s;eated at the door of a cottage,
and, having explained her &s;ituation, entreat|ed
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Several of them ro&s;e
with alacrity, and, offering any &s;ervice in
their power, followed Emily, who &s;eemed
to move on the wind, as fa&s;t as they could
towards the road.</P>
<P>When &s;he reached the carriage, &s;he found
St. Aubert re&s;tored to animation. On the
recovery of his &s;en&s;es, having heard from
Michael whither his daughter was gone,
anxiety for her overcame every regard for
him&s;elf, and he had &s;ent him in &s;earch of
her. He was, however, &s;till languid, and,
perceiving him&s;elf unable to travel much
further, he renewed his enquiries for an
<PB N="176" REF="186">
inn, and concerning the chateau in the
woods. "The chateau cannot accommo|date
you, &s;ir," &s;aid a venerable pea&s;ant who
had followed Emily from the woods, "it is
&s;carcely inhabited; but, if you will do me
the honour to vi&s;it my cottage, you &s;hall
be welcome to the be&s;t bed it affords."</P>
<P>St. Aubert was him&s;elf a Frenchman;
he, therefore, was not &s;urpri&s;ed at French
courte&s;y; but, ill as he was, he felt the va|lue
of the offer enhanced by the manner
which accompanied it. He had too much
delicacy to apologize, or to appear to he&s;itate
about availing him&s;elf of the pea&s;ant's ho&s;|pitality,
but immediately accepted it with
the &s;ame frankne&s;s with which it was of|fered.</P>
<P>The carriage again moved &s;lowly on;
Michael following the pea&s;ants up the lane,
which Emily had ju&s;t quitted, till they came
to the moon light glade. St. Aubert's &s;pirits
were &s;o far re&s;tored by the courte&s;y of his
ho&s;t, and the near pro&s;pect of repo&s;e, that
he looked with a &s;weet complacency upon
<PB N="177" REF="187">
the moon-light &s;cene, &s;urrounded by the
&s;hadowy woods, through which, here and
there, an opening admitted the &s;treaming
&s;plendour, di&s;covering a cottage, or a &s;park|ling
rivulet. He li&s;tened, with no painful
emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar
and tamborine; and, though tears came
to his eyes, when he &s;aw the <HI>debonnaire</HI>
dance of the pea&s;ants, they were not merely
tears of mournful regret. With Emily it
was otherwi&s;e; immediate terror for her fa|ther
had now &s;ub&s;ided into a gentle melan|choly,
which every note of joy, by awaken|ing
compari&s;on, &s;erved to heighten.</P>
<P>The dance cea&s;ed on the approach of the
carriage, which was a phenomenon in the&s;e
&s;eque&s;tered woods, and the pea&s;antry flock|ed
round it with eager curio&s;ity. On learn|ing
that it brought a &s;ick &s;tranger, &s;everal
girls ran acro&s;s the turf, and returned with
wine and ba&s;kets of grapes, which they pre|&s;ented
to the travellers, each with kind con|tention
pre&s;&s;ing for a preference. At length,
the carriage &s;topped at a neat cottage, and
<PB N="178" REF="188">
his venerable conductor, having a&s;&s;i&s;led St.
Aubert to alight, led him and Emily to
a &s;mall inner room, illumined only by
moon-beams, which the open ca&s;ement ad|mitted.
St. Aubert, rejoicing in re&s;t, &s;eat|ed
him&s;elf in an arm-chair, and his &s;en&s;es
were refre&s;hed by the cool and balmy air,
that lightly waved the embowering honey|&s;uckles,
and wafted their &s;weet breath into
the apartment. His ho&s;t, who was called
La Voi&s;in, quitted the room, but &s;oon re|turned
with fruits, cream, and all the pa&s;to|ral
luxury his cottage afforded; having &s;et
down which, with a &s;mile of unfeigned
welcome, he retired behind the chair of his
gue&s;t. St. Aubert in&s;i&s;ted on his taking
a &s;eat at the table, and, when the fruit
had allayed the fever of his palate, and he
found him&s;elf &s;omewhat revived, he began
to conver&s;e with his ho&s;t, who communica|ted
&s;everal particulars concerning him&s;elf
and his family, which were intere&s;ting, be|cau&s;e
they were &s;poken from the heart, and
delineated a picture of the &s;weet courte&s;ies
<PB N="179" REF="189">
of family kindne&s;s. Emily &s;at by her father,
holding his hand, and, while &s;he li&s;tened to
the old man, her heart &s;welled with the af|fectionate
&s;ympathy he de&s;cribed, and her
tears fell to the mournful con&s;ideration, that
death would probably &s;oon deprive her of
the deare&s;t ble&s;&s;ing &s;he then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The
&s;oft moon-light of an autumnal evening,
and the di&s;tant mu&s;ic, which now &s;ounded
a plaintive &s;train, aided the melancholy of
her mind. The old man continued to talk
of his family, and St. Aubert remained
&s;ilent. "I have only one daughter living,"
&s;aid La Voi&s;in, "but &s;he is happily mar|ried,
and is every thing to me. When I
lo&s;t my wife," he added with a &s;igh, "I
came to live with Agnes, and her fami|ly;
&s;he has &s;everal children, who are all
dancing on the green yonder, as merry as
gra&s;shoppers&mdash;and long may they be &s;o!
I hope to die among them, mon&s;ieur. I
am old now, and cannot expect to live
long, but there is &s;ome comfort in dying
&s;urrounded by one's children."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="190">
"My good friend," &s;aid St. Aubert,
while his voice trembled, "I hope you will
long live &s;urrounded by them."</P>
<P>"Ah, &s;ir! at my age I mu&s;t not expect
that!" replied the old man, and he pau&s;ed:
"I can &s;carcely wi&s;h it," he re&s;umed, "for
I tru&s;t that whenever I die I &s;hall go to
heaven, where my poor wife is gone before
me. I can &s;ometimes almo&s;t fancy I &s;ee her
of a &s;till moon-light night, walking among
the&s;e &s;hades &s;he loved &s;o well. Do you be|lieve,
mon&s;ieur, that we &s;hall be permitted
to revi&s;it the earth, after we have quitted
the body?"</P>
<P>Emily could no longer &s;tifle the angui&s;h
of her heart; her tears fell fa&s;t upon her
father's hand, which &s;he yet held. He
made an effort to &s;peak, and at length &s;aid
in a low voice, "I hope we &s;hall be per|mitted
to look down on tho&s;e we have left
on the earth, but I can only hope it. Fu|turity
is much veiled from our eyes, and
faith and hope are our only guides concern|ing
it. We are not enjoined to believe, that
<PB N="181" REF="191">
di&s;embodied &s;pirits watch over the friends
they have loved, but we may innocently
hope it. It is a hope which I will never
re&s;ign," continued he, while he wiped the
tears from his daughter's eyes, "it will &s;weet|en
the bitter moments of death!" Tears
fell &s;lowly on his cheeks; La Voi&s;in wept
too, and there was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence. Then,
La Voi&s;in, renewing the &s;ubject, &s;aid, "But
you believe, &s;ir, that we &s;hall meet in another
world the relations we have loved in this; I
mu&s;t believe this." "Then do believe it,"
replied St. Aubert, "&s;evere, indeed, would
be the pangs of &s;eparation, if we believed it
to be eternal. Look up, my dear Emily,
we &s;hall meet again!" He lifted his eyes
towards heaven, and a gleam of moon-light,
which fell upon his countenance, di&s;cover|ed
peace and re&s;ignation, &s;tealing on the
lines of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>La Voi&s;in felt that he had pur&s;ued the
&s;ubject too far, and he dropped it, &s;aying,
"We are in darkne&s;s, I forgot to bring a
light"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid St. Aubert, "this is a light
<PB N="182" REF="192">
I love. Sit down, my good friend. Emi|ly,
my love, I find my&s;elf better than I
have been all day; this air refre&s;hes me.
I can enjoy this tranquil hour, and that
mu&s;ic, which floats &s;o &s;weetly at a di&s;tance.
Let me &s;ee you &s;mile. "Who touches that
guitar &s;o ta&s;tefully? are there two in&s;tru|ments,
or is it an echo I hear?"</P>
<P>"It is an echo, mon&s;ieur, I fancy. That
guitar is often heard at night, when all
is &s;till, but nobody knows who touches it,
and it is &s;ometimes accompanied by a voice
&s;o &s;weet, and &s;o &s;ad, one would almo&s;t
think the woods were haunted." "They
certainly are haunted," &s;aid St. Aubert with
a &s;mile, "but I believe it is by mortals."
"I have &s;ometimes heard it at midnight,
when I could not &s;leep," rejoined La
Voi&s;in, not &s;eeming to notice this re|mark,
"almo&s;t under my window, and
I never heard any mu&s;ic like it. It has
often made me think of my poor wife till I
cried. I have &s;ometimes got up to the win|dow
to look if I could &s;ee any body, but
<PB N="183" REF="193">
as &s;oon as I opened the ca&s;ement all was
hu&s;hed, and nobody to be &s;een; and I have
li&s;tened, and li&s;tened till I have been &s;o ti|morous,
that even the trembling of the
leaves in the breeze has made me &s;tart.
They &s;ay it often comes to warn people of
their death, but I have heard it the&s;e many
years, and outlived the warning."</P>
<P>Emily, though &s;he &s;miled at the mention
of this ridiculous &s;uper&s;tition, could not, in
the pre&s;ent tone of her &s;pirits, wholly re&s;i&s;t
its contagion.</P>
<P>"Well, but, my good friend," &s;aid St.
Aubert, "has nobody had courage to follow
the &s;ounds? If they had, they would probably
have di&s;covered who is the mu&s;ician." "Yes,
&s;ir, they have followed them &s;ome way into
the woods, but the mu&s;ic has &s;till retreated,
and &s;eemed as di&s;tant as ever, and the peo|ple
have at la&s;t been afraid of being led in|to
harm, and would go no further. It is
very &s;eldom that I have heard the&s;e &s;ounds
&s;o early in the evening. They u&s;ually come
about midnight, when that bright planet,
<PB N="184" REF="194">
which is ri&s;ing above the turret yonder, &s;ets
below the woods on the left."</P>
<P>"What turret?" a&s;ked St. Aubert with
quickne&s;s, "I &s;ee none."</P>
<P>"Your pardon, mon&s;ieur, you do &s;ee
one indeed, for the moon &s;hines full upon
it;&mdash;up the avenue yonder, a long way off;
the chateau it belongs to is hid among the
trees."</P>
<P>"Yes, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid Emily pointing,
"don't you &s;ee &s;omething glitter above the
dark woods? It is a fane, I fancy, which
the rays fall upon."</P>
<P>"O yes, I &s;ee what you mean; and who
does the chateau belong to?"</P>
<P>"The Marquis de Villeroi was its own|er,"
replied La Voi&s;in, emphatically.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid St. Aubert with a deep &s;igh,
"are we then &s;o near Le-Blanc!" He ap|peared
much agitated.</P>
<P>"It u&s;ed to be the Marquis's favourite
re&s;idence," re&s;umed La Voi&s;in, "but he
took a di&s;like to the place, and has not been
there for many years. We have heard
<PB N="185" REF="195">
lately that he is dead, and that it is fallen
into other hands." St. Aubert, who had
&s;at in deep mu&s;ing, was rou&s;ed by the la&s;t
words. "Dead!" he exclaimed, "Good
God! when did he die?"</P>
<P>"He is reported to have died about five
weeks &s;ince," replied La Voi&s;in. "Did you
know the Marquis, &s;ir?"</P>
<P>"This is very extraordinary!" &s;aid St.
Aubert without attending to the que&s;tion.
"Why is it &s;o, my dear &s;ir?" &s;aid Emily,
in a voice" of timid curio&s;ity. He made no
reply, but &s;unk again into a reverie; and
in a few moments, when he &s;eemed to have
recovered him&s;elf, a&s;ked who had &s;ucceeded
to the e&s;tates. "I have forgot his title,
mon&s;ieur," &s;aid La Voi&s;in; "but my lord
re&s;ides at Paris chiefly; I hear no talk of
his coming hither."</P>
<P>"The chateau is &s;hut up then, &s;till?"</P>
<P>"Why, little better, &s;ir; the old hou&s;e|keeper,
and her hu&s;band the &s;teward, have
the care of it, but they live generally in a
cottage hard by."</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="196">
"The chateau is &s;pacious, I &s;uppo&s;e,"
&s;aid Emily, "and mu&s;t be de&s;olate for the
te&s;idence of only two per&s;ons."</P>
<P>De&s;olate enough, mademoi&s;elle," re|plied
La Voi&s;in, "I would not pa&s;s one
night in the chateau, for the value of the
whole domain."</P>
<P>"What is that?" &s;aid St. Aubert, rou&s;ed
again from thoughtfulne&s;s. As his ho&s;t
repeated his la&s;t &s;entence, a groan e&s;caped
from St. Aubert, and then, as if anxious
to prevent it from being noticed, he ha&s;tily
a&s;ked La Voi&s;in how long he had lived

childhood, &s;ir," replied his ho&s;t.</P>
<P>"You remember the late marchione&s;s,
then?" &s;aid St. Aubert in an altered voice.</P>
<P>"Ah, mon&s;ieur!&mdash;that I do well. There
are many be&s;ide me who remember her."</P>
<P>"Yes&mdash;" &s;aid St. Aubert, "and I am
one of tho&s;e."</P>
<P>"Alas, &s;ir! you remember, then, a mo&s;t
beautiful and excellent lady. She de&s;erved
a better fate."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="197">
Tears &s;tood in St. Aubert's eyes;
"Enough," &s;aid he, in a voice almo&s;t &s;tifled
by the violence of his emotions,&mdash;"it is
enough, my friend."</P>
<P>Emily, though extremely &s;urpri&s;ed by
her father's manner, forbore to expre&s;s her
feelings by any que&s;tion. La Voi&s;in began
to apologize, but St. Aubert interrupted
him; "Apology is quite unnece&s;&s;ary,"
&s;aid he, "let us change the topic. You
was &s;peaking of the mu&s;ic we ju&s;t now
heard."</P>
<P>"I was, mon&s;ieur,&mdash;but hark!&mdash;it comes

<P>In a few moments the voice died into air,
and the in&s;trument, which had been heard
<PB N="188" REF="198">
before, &s;ounded in low &s;ymphony. St. Au|bert
now ob&s;erved, that it produced a tone
much more full and melodious than that of
a guitar, and &s;till more melancholy and &s;oft
than the lute. They continued to li&s;ten, but the
&s;ounds returned no more. "This is &s;trange!"
&s;aid St. Aubert, at length interrupting the
&s;ilence. "Very &s;trange!" &s;aid Emily. "It
is &s;o," rejoined La Voi&s;in, and they were
again &s;ilent.</P>
<P>After a long pau&s;e, "It is now about
eighteen years &s;ince I fir&s;t heard that mu|&s;ic,"
&s;aid La Voi&s;in; "I remember it was
on a fine &s;ummer's night, much like this,
but later, that I was walking in the woods,
and alone. I remember, too, that my &s;pirits
were very low, for one of my boys was ill,
and we feared we mould lo&s;e him. I had
been watching at his bed-&s;ide all the even|ing
while his mother &s;lept; for &s;he had &s;at
up with him the night before. I had been
watching, and went out for a little fre&s;h air,
the day had been very &s;ultry. As I walk|ed
under the &s;hades and mu&s;ed, I heard mu|&s;ic
<PB N="189" REF="199">
at a di&s;tance, and thought it was Claude
playing upon his flute, as he often did of a
fine evening, at the cottage door. But,
when I came to a place, where the trees
opened, (I &s;hall never forget it!) and &s;tood
looking up at the north-lights, which &s;hot
up the heaven to a great height, I heard all
of a &s;udden &s;uch &s;ounds!&mdash;they came &s;o as
I cannot de&s;cribe. It was like the mu&s;ic of
angels, and I looked up again almo&s;t ex|pecting
to &s;ee them in the &s;ky. When I
came home, I told what I had heard, but
they laughed at me, and &s;aid it mu&s;t be &s;ome
of the &s;hepherds playing on their pipes, and
I could not per&s;uade them to the contrary.
A few nights after, however, my wife her|&s;elf
heard the &s;ame &s;ounds, and was as much
&s;urpri&s;ed as I was, and father Denis fright|ened
her &s;adly by &s;aying, that it was mu&s;ic
come to warn her of her child's death, and
that mu&s;ic often came to hou&s;es where there
was a dying per&s;on."</P>
<P>Emily, on hearing this, &s;hrunk with a
&s;uper&s;titious dread entirely new to her, and
<PB N="190" REF="200">
could &s;carcely conceal her agitation from
St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"But the boy lived, mon&s;ieur, in &s;pite
of father Denis."</P>
<P>"Father Denis!" &s;aid St. Aubert, who
had li&s;tened to "narrative old age" with
patient attention, "are we near a convent,
then?"</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir, the convent of St. Clair &s;tands
at no great di&s;tance, on the &s;ea &s;hore
yonder."</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid St. Aubert, as if &s;truck
with &s;ome &s;udden remembrance, "the con|vent of St. Clair!" Emily ob&s;erved the
clouds of grief, mingled with a faint ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of horror, gathering on his brow;
his countenance became fixed, and, touched
as it now was by the &s;ilver whitene&s;s of the
moon light, he re&s;embled one of tho&s;e mar|ble

"But, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, anxious
to di&s;&s;ipate his thoughts, "you forget that
repo&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to you. If our kind
ho&s;t will give me leave, I will prepare your
bed, for I know how you like it to be
made." St. Aubert, recollecting him&s;elf,
and &s;miling affectionately, de&s;ired &s;he would
not add to her fatigue by that attention;
and La Voi&s;in, who&s;e con&s;ideration for his
gue&s;t had been &s;u&s;pended by the intere&s;ts,
which his own narrative had recalled, now
&s;tarted from his &s;eat, and, apologizing for
not having called Agnes from the green,
hurried out of the room.</P>
<P>In a few moments he returned with his
daughter, a young woman of a plea&s;ing
countenance, and Emily learned from her,
what &s;he had not before &s;u&s;pected, that, for
their accommodation, it was nece&s;&s;ary part
of La Voi&s;in's family &s;hould leave their
beds; &s;he lamented this circum&s;tance, but
Agnes, by her reply, fully proved that &s;he
inherited, at lea&s;t, a &s;hare of her father's
courteous ho&s;pitality. It was &s;ettled, that
<PB N="192" REF="202">
&s;ome of her children and Michael &s;hould
&s;leep in the neighbouring cottage.</P>
<P>"If I am better, to-morrow, my dear,"
&s;aid St. Aubert when Emily returned to
him, "I mean to &s;et out at an early hour,
that we may re&s;t, during the heat of the
day, and will travel towards home. In the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of my health and &s;pirits, I can|not
look on a longer journey with plea&s;ure,
and I am al&s;o very anxious to reach La
Vall&eacute;e." Emily, though &s;he al&s;o de&s;ired
to return, was grieved at her father's &s;udden
wi&s;h to do &s;o, which &s;he thought indicated
a greater degree of indi&s;po&s;ition than he
would acknowledge. St. Aubert now re|tired
to re&s;t, and Emily to her little cham|ber,
but not to immediate repo&s;e. Her
thoughts returned to the late conver&s;ation,
concerning the &s;tate of departed &s;pirits; a
&s;ubject, at this time, particularly affecting
to her, when &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe,
that her dear father would ere long be num|bered
with them. She leaned pen&s;ively on
the little open ca&s;ement, and in deep thought
<PB N="193" REF="203">
fixed her eyes on the heaven, who&s;e blue
unclouded concave was &s;tudded thick with
&s;tars, the worlds, perhaps, of &s;pirits, un|&s;phered
of mortal mould. As her eyes
wandered along the boundle&s;s aether, her
thoughts ro&s;e, as before, towards the &s;ubli|mity
of the Deity, and to the contemplation
of futurity. No bu&s;y note of this world
interrupted the cour&s;e of her mind; the
merry dance had cea&s;ed, and every cottager
had retired to his home. The &s;till air &s;eemed
&s;carcely to breathe upon the woods, and,
now and then, the di&s;tant &s;ound of a &s;oli|tary
&s;heep-bell, or of a clo&s;ing ca&s;ement, was
all that broke on &s;ilence. At length, even
this hint of human being was heard no
more. Elevated and enwrapt, while her
eyes were often wet with tears of &s;ublime
devotion and &s;olemn awe, &s;he continued at
the ca&s;ement, till the gloom of mid-night
hung over the earth, and the planet, which
La Voi&s;in had pointed out, &s;unk below the
woods. She then recollected what he had
&s;aid concerning this planet, and the my&s;te|rious
<PB N="194" REF="204">
mu&s;ic; and, as &s;he lingered at the
window, half hoping and half fearing that
it would return, her mind was led to the
remembrance of the extreme emotion her
father had &s;hewn on mention of the Marquis
La Villeroi's death, and of the fate of the
Marchione&s;s, and &s;he felt &s;trongly intere&s;ted
concerning the remote cau&s;e of this emotion.
Her &s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity were indeed the
greater, becau&s;e &s;he did not recollect ever
to have heard him mention the name of
Villeroi.</P>
<P>No mu&s;ic, however, &s;tole on the &s;ilence of
the night, and Emily, perceiving the latene&s;s
of the hour, returned to a &s;cene of fatigue,
remembered that &s;he was to ri&s;e early in the
morning, and withdrew from the window to
repo&s;e.</P>

<P>EMILY, called, as &s;he had reque&s;ted, at
an early hour, awoke, little refre&s;hed by
&s;leep, for unea&s;y dreams had pur&s;ued her, and
marred the kinde&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of the unhappy.
But, when &s;he opened her ca&s;ement, looked
out upon the woods, bright with the morn|ing
&s;un, and in&s;pired the pure air, her
mind was &s;oothed. The &s;cene was filled
with that cheering fre&s;hne&s;s, which &s;eems to
breathe the very &s;pirit of health, and &s;he heard

of a di&s;tant convent, the faint murmur
of the &s;ea-waves, the &s;ong of birds, and
the far-off low of cattle, which &s;he &s;aw
coming &s;lowly on between the trunks of the
trees. Struck with the circum&s;tances of
imagery around her, &s;he indulged the pen|&s;ive
tranquillity which they in&s;pired; and
while &s;he leaned on her window, waiting

<P>Emily now heard per&s;ons moving below
in the cottage, and pre&s;ently the voice of
Michael, who was talking to his mules, as
he led them forth from a hut adjoining.
As &s;he left her room, St. Aubert, who was
now ri&s;en, met her at the door, apparently
as little re&s;tored by &s;leep as her&s;elf. She
led him down &s;tairs to the little parlour,
in which they had &s;upped on the preceding
night, where they found a neat breakfa&s;t
&s;et out, while the ho&s;t and his daughter
waited to bid them good morrow.</P>
<P>"I envy you this cottage, my good
friends," &s;aid St. Aubert, as he met them,
<PB N="198" REF="208">
"it is &s;o plea&s;ant, &s;o quiet, and &s;o neat;
and this air, that one breathes&mdash;if any thing
could re&s;tore lo&s;t health, it would &s;urely be
this air."</P>
<P>La Voi&s;in bowed gratefully, and replied,
with the gallantry of a Frenchman, "Our
cottage may be envied, &s;ir, &s;ince you and
Mademoi&s;elle have honoured it with your
pre&s;ence." St. Aubert gave him a friendly
&s;mile for his compliment, and &s;at down to
a table, &s;pread with cream, fruit, new
chee&s;e, butter, and coffee. Emily, who
had ob&s;erved her father with attention, and
thought he looked very ill, endeavoured to
per&s;uade him to defer travelling till the af|ternoon;
but he &s;eemed very anxious to be
at home, and his anxiety he expre&s;&s;ed re|peatedly,
and with an earne&s;tne&s;s that was
unu&s;ual with him. He now &s;aid, he found
him&s;elf as well as he had been of late, and
that he could bear travelling better in the
cool hour of the morning, than at any other
time. But, while he was talking with his
venerable ho&s;t, and thanking him for his
kind attentions, Emily ob&s;erved his coun|tenance
<PB N="199" REF="209">
change, and, before &s;he could reach
him, he fell back in his chair. In a few
moments he recovered from the &s;udden
faintne&s;s that had come over him, but felt
&s;o ill, that he perceived him&s;elf unable to
&s;et out, and, having remained a little while,
&s;truggling again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of
indi&s;po&s;i|tion,
he begged he might be helped up
&s;tairs to bed. This reque&s;t renewed all the
terror which Emily had &s;uffered on the pre|ceding
evening; but, though &s;carcely able
to &s;upport her&s;elf, under the &s;udden &s;hock
it gave her, &s;he tried to conceal her appre|hen&s;ions
from St. Aubert, and gave her
trembling arm to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to the door of
his chamber.</P>
<P>When he was once more in bed, he de|&s;ired
that Emily, who was then weeping
in her own room, might be called; and, as
&s;he came, he waved his hand for every
other per&s;on to quit the apartment. When
they were alone, he held out his hand to
her, and fixed his eyes upon her counte|nance,
with an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o full of tender|ne&s;s
and grief, that all her fortitude for&s;ook
<PB N="200" REF="210">
her, and &s;he bur&s;t into an agony of tears.
St. Aubert &s;eemed &s;truggling to acquire
firmne&s;s, but was &s;till unable to &s;peak; he
could only pre&s;s her hand, and check the tears
that &s;tood trembling in his eyes. At length,
he commanded his voice, "My dear child,"
&s;aid he, trying to &s;mile through his angui&s;h,
"my dear Emily!"&mdash;and pau&s;ed again.
He rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven, as if in prayer,
and then, in a firmer tone, and with a look,
in which the tenderne&s;s of the father was
dignified by the pious &s;olemnity of the &s;aint,
he &s;aid, "My dear child, I would &s;often
the painful truth I have to tell you, but I
find my&s;elf quite unequal to the art. Alas!
I would, at this moment, conceal it from
you, but that it would be mo&s;t cruel to de|ceive
you. It cannot be long before we
mu&s;t part; let us talk of it, that our
thoughts and our prayers may prepare us
to bear it." His voice faltered, while
Emily, &s;till weeping, pre&s;&s;ed his hand clo&s;e
to her heart, which &s;welled with a convul|&s;ive
&s;igh, but &s;he could not look up.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="211">
"Let me not wa&s;te the&s;e moments," &s;aid
St. Aubert, recovering him&s;elf, "I have
much to &s;ay. There is a circum&s;tance of &s;o|lemn
con&s;equence, which I have to mention,
and a &s;olemn promi&s;e to obtain from you;
when this is done I &s;hall be ea&s;ier. You
have ob&s;erved, my dear, how anxious I am
to reach home, but know not all my rea&s;ons
for this. Li&s;ten to what I am going to &s;ay.&mdash;Yet
&s;tay&mdash;before I &s;ay more give me
this promi&s;e, a promi&s;e made to your dying
father!"&mdash;St. Aubert was interrupted;
Emily, &s;truck by his la&s;t words, as if for
the fir&s;t time, with a conviction of his im|mediate
danger, rai&s;ed her head; her tears
&s;topped, and, gazing at him for a moment
with an expre&s;&s;ion of unutterable angui&s;h,
a &s;light convul&s;ion &s;eized her, and &s;he &s;unk
&s;en&s;ele&s;s in her chair. St. Aubert's cries
brought La Voi&s;in and his daughter to the
room, and they admini&s;tered every means
in their power to re&s;tore her, but, for a
con&s;iderable time, without effect. When
&s;he recovered, St. Aubert was &s;o exhau&s;ted
by the &s;cene he had witne&s;&s;ed, that it was
<PB N="202" REF="212">
many minutes before he had &s;trength to
&s;peak; he was, however, &s;omewhat revived
by a cordial, which Emily gave him; and,
being again alone with her, he exerted him|&s;elf
to tranquillize her &s;pirits, and to offer
her all the comfort of which her &s;ituation
admitted. She threw her&s;elf into his arms,
wept on his neck, and grief made her &s;o in|&s;en&s;ible
to all he &s;aid, that he cea&s;ed to offer
the alleviations, which he him&s;elf could not,
at this moment, feel, and mingled his &s;ilent
tears with hers. Recalled, at length, to a,
&s;en&s;e of duty, &s;he tried to &s;pare her father
from farther view of her &s;uffering; and,
quitting his embrace, dried her tears, and
&s;aid &s;omething, which &s;he meant for con|&s;olation.
"My dear Emily," replied St.
Aubert, "my dear child, we mu&s;t look up
with humble confidence to that Being, who
has protected and comforted us in every
danger, and in every affliction we have
known; to who&s;e eye every moment of our
lives has been expo&s;ed; he will not, he does
not, for&s;ake us now; I feel his con&s;olations
in my heart. I &s;hall leave you, my child,
<PB N="203" REF="213">
&s;till in his care; and, though I depart from
this world, I &s;hall be &s;till in his pre&s;ence.
Nay, weep not again, my Emily. In
death there is nothing new, or &s;urpri&s;ing,
&s;ince we all know, that we are born to die;
and nothing terrible to tho&s;e, who can con|&s;ide
in an all-powerful God. Had my life
been &s;pared now, after a very few years, in
the cour&s;e of nature, I mu&s;t have re&s;igned
it; old age, with all its train of infirmity,
its privations and its &s;orrows, would have
been mine; and then, at la&s;t, death would
have come, and called, forth the tears you
now &s;hed. Rather, my child, rejoice, that
I am &s;aved from &s;uch &s;uffering, and that I
am permitted to die with a mind unim|paired,
and &s;en&s;ible of the comforts of faith
and of re&s;ignation." St. Aubert pau&s;ed,
fatigued, with &s;peaking. Emily again en|deavoured
to a&s;&s;ume an air of compo&s;ure;
and, in replying to what he had &s;aid, tried
to &s;ooth him with a belief, that he had not
&s;poken in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="214">
When he had repo&s;ed a while, he re&s;umed
the conver&s;ation. "Let me return," &s;aid
he, "to a &s;ubject, which is very near
my heart. I &s;aid I had a &s;olemn promi&s;e
to receive from you; let me receive it now,
before I explain the chief circum&s;tance
which it concerns; there are others, of
which your peace requires that you &s;hould
re&s;t in ignorance. Promi&s;e, then, that you
will perform exactly what I &s;hall enjoin."</P>
<P>Emily, awed by the earne&s;t &s;olemnity of
his manner, dried her tears, that had be|gun
again to flow, in &s;pite of her efforts to
&s;uppre&s;s them; and, looking eloquently
at St. Aubert, bound her&s;elf to do what|ever
he &s;hould require by a vow, at which
&s;he &s;huddered, yet knew not why.</P>
<P>He proceeded: "I know you too well,
my Emily, to believe, that you would break
any promi&s;e, much le&s;s one thus &s;olemnly
given; your a&s;&s;urance gives me peace, and
the ob&s;ervance of it is of the utmo&s;t im|portance
to your tranquillity. Hear, then,
what I am going to tell you. The clo&s;et,
<PB N="205" REF="215">
which adjoins my chamber at La Vall&eacute;e,
has a &s;liding board in the floor. You will
know it by a remarkable knot in the wood,
and by its being the next board, except
one, to the wain&s;cot, which fronts the door.
At the di&s;tance of about a yard from that
end, nearer the window, you will perceive a
line acro&s;s it, as if the plank had been
joined;&mdash;the way to open it is this:&mdash;Pre&s;s
your foot upon the line, the end of the
board will then &s;ink, and you may &s;lide it
with ea&s;e beneath the other. Below, you
will &s;ee a hollow place." St. Aubert
pau&s;ed for breath, and Emily &s;at fixed in
deep attention. "Do you under&s;tand the&s;e
directions, my dear?" &s;aid he. Emily,
though &s;carcely able to &s;peak, a&s;&s;ured him,
that &s;he did.</P>
<P>"When you return home, then," he
added with a deep &s;igh&mdash;</P>
<P>At the mention of her return home, all
the melancholy circum&s;tances, that mu&s;t
attend this return, ru&s;hed upon her fancy;
&s;he bur&s;t into convul&s;ive grief, and St. Aubert
<PB N="206" REF="216">
him&s;elf, affected beyond the re&s;i&s;tance of
the fortitude which he had, at fir&s;t, &s;um|moned,
wept with her. After &s;ome mo|ments,
he compo&s;ed him&s;elf. "My dear
child," &s;aid he, "be comforted. "When I
am gone, you will not be for&s;aken&mdash;I leave
you only in the more immediate care of
that Providence, which has never yet for|&s;aken
me. Do not afflict me with this ex|ce&s;s
of grief; rather teach me by your ex|ample
to bear my own." He &s;topped
again, and Emily, the more &s;he endeavoured
to re&s;train her emotion, found it the le&s;s
po&s;&s;ible to do &s;o.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, who now &s;poke with pain,
re&s;umed the &s;ubject. "That clo&s;et, my
dear,&mdash;when you return home, go to it;
and, beneath the board I have de&s;cribed,
you will find a packet of written papers.
Attend to me now, for the promi&s;e you
have given particularly relates, to what I
&s;hall direct. The&s;e papers you mu&s;t burn&mdash;and,
&s;olemnly I command you, <HI>without exa|mining
them.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="217">
Emily's &s;urpri&s;e, for a moment, over|came
her grief, and &s;he ventured to a&s;k,
why this mu&s;t be? St. Aubert replied,
that, if it had been right for him to explain
his rea&s;ons, her late promi&s;e would have
been unnece&s;&s;arily exacted. It is &s;ufficient
for you, my love, to have a deep &s;en&s;e of
the importance of ob&s;erving me in this in|&s;tance."
Sr. Aubert proceeded. "Un|der
that board you will al&s;o find about
two hundred louis d'ors, wrapped in a &s;ilk
pur&s;e; indeed, it was to &s;ecure whatever
money might be in the chateau, that this &s;e|cret
place was contrived, at a time when
the province was over-run by troops of
men, who took advantage of the tumults,
and became plunderers.</P>
<P>"But I have yet another promi&s;e to re|ceive
froms you, which is&mdash;that you will
never, whatever may be your future cir|cum&s;tances,
<HI>&s;ell</HI> the chateau." St. Aubert
even enjoined her, whenever &s;he might
marry, to make it an article in the contract,
that the chateau &s;hould always be hers.
<PB N="208" REF="218">
He then gave her a more minute account of
his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances than he had yet
done, adding, "The two hundred louis,
with what money you will now find in my
pur&s;e, is all the ready money I have to
leave you. I have told you how I am cir|cum&s;tanced
with M. Motteville, at Paris.
Ah, my child! I leave you poor&mdash;but not
de&s;titute," he added, after a long pau&s;e.
Emily could make no reply to any thing he
now &s;aid, but knelt at the bed-&s;ide, with
her face upon the quilt, weeping over the
hand &s;he held there.</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation, the mind of St.
Aubert appeared to be much more at ea&s;e;
but, exhau&s;ted by the effort of &s;peaking, he
&s;unk into a kind of doze, and Emily conti|nued
to watch and weep be&s;ide him, till a
gentle tap at the chamber-door rou&s;ed her.
It was La Voi&s;in, come to &s;ay, that a con|fe&s;&s;or
from the neighbouring convent was
below, ready to attend St. Aubert. Emily
would not &s;uffer her father to be di&s;turbed,
but de&s;ired, that the prie&s;t might hot leave
<PB N="209" REF="219">
the cottage. When St. Aubert awoke
from this doze, his &s;en&s;es were confu&s;ed,
and it was &s;ome moments before he reco|vered
them &s;ufficiently to know, that it was
Emily who &s;at be&s;ide him. He then moved
his lips, and &s;tretched forth his hand to
her; as &s;he received which, &s;he &s;unk back
in her chair, overcome by the impre&s;&s;ion of
death on his countenance. In a few mi|nutes
he recovered his voice, and Emily
then a&s;ked, if he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the confe&s;&s;or,
he replied, that he did; and, when the holy
father appeared, &s;he withdrew. They re|mained
alone together above half an hour;
when Emily was called in, &s;he found St.
Aubert more agitated than when &s;he had
left him, and &s;he gazed, with a &s;light de|gree
of re&s;entment, at the friar, as the cau&s;e
of this; who, however, looked mildly and
mournfully at her, and turned away. St.
Aubert, in a tremulous voice, &s;aid, he
wi&s;hed her to join in prayer with him, and
a&s;ked if La Voi&s;in would do &s;o too. The
old man and his daughter came; they both
<PB N="210" REF="220">
wept, and knelt with Emily round the bed,
while the holy father read in a &s;olemn voice
the &s;ervice for the dying. St. Aubert lay
with a &s;erene countenance, and &s;eemed to
join fervently in the devotion, while tears
often &s;tole from beneath his clo&s;ed eye-lids,
and Emily's &s;obs more than once inter|rupted
the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When it was concluded, and extreme
unction had been admini&s;tered, the friar
withdrew. St. Aubert then made a &s;ign
for La Voi&s;in to come nearer. He gave
him his hand, and was, for a moment,
&s;ilent. At length, he &s;aid, in a trembling
voice, "My good friend, our acquaintance
has been &s;hort, but long enough to give
you an opportunity of &s;hewing me much
kind attention. I cannot doubt, that you
will extend this kindne&s;s to my daughter,
when I am gone; &s;he will have need of it.
I entru&s;t her to your care during the few
days &s;he will remain here. I need &s;ay no
more&mdash;you know the feelings of a father,
for you have children; mine would be, in|deed,
<PB N="211" REF="221">
deed, &s;evere if I had le&s;s confidence in you."
He pau&s;ed. La Voi&s;in a&s;&s;ured him, and
his tears bore te&s;timony to his &s;incerity,
that he would do all he could to &s;often her
affliction, and that, if St. Aubert wi&s;hed it,
he would even attend her into Ga&s;cony; an
offer &s;o plea&s;ing to St. Aubert, that he had
&s;carcely words to acknowledge his &s;en&s;e of
the old man's kindne&s;s, or to tell him, that
he accepted it. The &s;cene, that followed
between St. Aubert and Emily, affected
La Voi&s;in &s;o much, that he quitted the
chamber, and &s;he was again left alone with
her father, who&s;e &s;pirits &s;eemed fainting fa&s;t,
but neither his &s;en&s;es, or his voice, yet failed
him; and, at intervals, he employed much
of the&s;e la&s;t awful moments in advi&s;ing his
daughter, as to her future conduct. Per|haps,
he never had thought more ju&s;tly, or
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf more clearly, than he did
now.</P>
<P>"Above all, my dear Emily," &s;aid he, "do
not indulge in the pride of fine feeling, the
romantic error of amiable minds. Tho&s;e,
<PB N="212" REF="222">
who really po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, ought early to
be taught, that it is a dangerous quality,
which is continually extracting the exce&s;s of
mi&s;ery, or delight, from every &s;urrounding
circum&s;tance. And, &s;ince, in our pa&s;&s;age
through this world, painful circum&s;tances
occur more frequently than plea&s;ing ones,
and &s;ince our &s;en&s;e of evil is, I fear, more
acute than our &s;en&s;e of good, we become
the victims of our feelings, unle&s;s we can
in &s;ome degree command them. I know you
will &s;ay, (for you are young, my Emily)
I know you will &s;ay, that you are contented
&s;ometimes to &s;uffer, rather than to give up
your refined &s;en&s;e of happine&s;s, at others;
but, when your mind has been long ha|ra&s;&s;ed by vici&s;&s;itude, you will be content to
re&s;t, and you will then recover from your
delu&s;ion. You will perceive, that the
phantom of happine&s;s is exchanged for the
&s;ub&s;tance; for happine&s;s ari&s;es in a &s;tate of
peace, not of tumult. It is of a temperate
and uniform nature, and can no more exi&s;t
in a heart, that is continually alive to mi|nute
<PB N="213" REF="223">
circum&s;tances, than in one that is dead
to feeling. You &s;ee, my dear, that, though
I would guard you again&s;t the dangers of
&s;en&s;ibility, I am not an advocate for apa|thy.
At your age I &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>that</HI> is
a vice more hateful than all the errors of
&s;en&s;ibility, and I &s;ay &s;o &s;till. I call it a
<HI>vice,</HI> becau&s;e it leads to po&s;itive evil; in
this, however, it does no more than an ill|governed
&s;en&s;ibility, which, by &s;uch a rule,
might al&s;o be called a vice; but the evil of
the former is of more general con&s;equence.
I have exhau&s;ted my&s;elf" &s;aid St. Aubert,
feebly, "and have wearied you, my Emily;
but, on a &s;ubject &s;o important to your fu|ture
comfort, I am anxious to be perfectly
under&s;tood."</P>
<P>Emily a&s;&s;ured him, that his advice was
mo&s;t precious to her, and that &s;he would
never forget it, or cea&s;e from endeavouring
to profit by it. St. Aubert &s;miled affec|tionately
and &s;orrowfully upon her. "I
repeat it," &s;aid he, "I would not teach you
to become in&s;en&s;ible, if I could; I would
<PB N="214" REF="224">
only warn you of the evils of &s;u&s;ceptibility,
and point out how you may avoid them.
Beware, my love, I conjure you, of that &s;elf|delu&s;ion,
which has been fatal to the peace of
&s;o many per&s;ons; beware of priding your&s;elf
on the gracefulne&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility; if you
yield to this vanity, your happine&s;s is lo&s;t
for ever. Always remember how much
more valuable is the &s;trength of fortitude,
than the grace of &s;en&s;ibility. Do not,
however, confound fortitude with apathy;
apathy cannot know the virtue. Remem|ber,
too, that one act of beneficence, one
act of real u&s;efulne&s;s, is worth all the ab|&s;tract
&s;entiment in the world. Sentiment
is a di&s;grace, in&s;tead of an ornament, unle&s;s
it lead us to good actions. The mi&s;er,
who thinks him&s;elf re&s;pectable, merely be|cau&s;e
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es wealth, and thus mi&s;takes
the means of doing good, for the actual ac|compli&s;hment
of it, is not more blameable
than the man of &s;entiment, without active
virtue. You may have ob&s;erved per&s;ons,
who delight &s;o much in this sort of &s;en&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="215" REF="225">
to &s;entiment, which excludes that to the
calls of any practical virtue, that they turn
from the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and, becau&s;e their &s;uf|ferings
are painful to be contemplated, do
not endeavour to relieve them. How de|&s;picable
is that humanity, which can be
contented to pity, where it might a&s;&s;uage!"</P>
<P>St. Aubert, &s;ome time after, &s;poke of
Madame Cheron, his &s;i&s;ter. "Let me in|form
you of a circum&s;tance, that nearly
affects, your welfare," he added. "We
have, you know, had little intercour&s;e for
&s;ome years; but, as &s;he is now your only
female relation, I have thought it proper to
con&s;ign you to her care, as you will &s;ee in my
will, till yon are of age, and to recommend
you to her protection afterwards. She is
not exactly the per&s;on, to whom I would
have committed my Emily, but I had no
alternative, and I believe her to be upon
the whole&mdash;a good kind of woman. I
need not recommend it to your prudence,
my love, to endeavour to conciliate her
<PB N="216" REF="226">
kindne&s;s; you will do this for his &s;ake, who
has often wi&s;hed to do &s;o for yours."</P>
<P>Emily a&s;&s;ured him, that, whatever he re|que&s;ted
&s;he would religiou&s;ly perform to
the utmo&s;t of her ability. "Alas!" added
&s;he, in a voice interrupted by &s;ighs, "that
will &s;oon be all which remains for me; it will
be almo&s;t my only con&s;olation to fulfil your
wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>St. Aubert looked up &s;ilently in her face,
as if he would have &s;poken, but his &s;pirit
&s;unk a while, and his eyes became heavy
and dull. She felt that look at her heart.
"My dear father!" &s;he exclaimed; and
then, checking her&s;elf, pre&s;&s;ed his hand
clo&s;er, and hid her face with her handker|chief.
Her tears were concealed, but St.
Aubert heard her convul&s;ive &s;obs. His
&s;pirits returned. "O my child!" &s;aid
he, faintly, "let my con&s;olations be yours.
I die in peace; for I know, that I am about
to return to the bo&s;om of my Father, who
will &s;till be your Father, when I am gone.
<PB N="217" REF="227">
Always tru&s;t in him, my love, and he will
&s;upport you in the&s;e moments, as he &s;up|ports
me."</P>
<P>Emily could only li&s;ten, and weep; but;
the extreme compo&s;ure of his manner, and
the faith and hope he expre&s;&s;ed, &s;omewhat
&s;oothed her angui&s;h. Yet, whenever &s;he
looked upon his emaciated countenance,
and &s;aw the lines of death beginning to
prevail over it&mdash;&s;aw his &s;unk eyes, &s;till bent
on her, and their heavy lids pre&s;&s;ing to a
clo&s;e, there was a pang in her heart, &s;uch as
defied expre&s;&s;ion, though it required filial
virtue, like hers, to forbear the attempt.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired once more to ble&s;s her;
"Where are you, my dear?" &s;aid he, as he
&s;tretched forth his hands. Emily had
turned to the window, that he might not
perceive her angui&s;h; &s;he now under&s;tood,
that his &s;ight had failed him. When he
had given her his ble&s;&s;ing, and it &s;eemed to
be the la&s;t effort of expiring life, he &s;unk
back on his pillow. She ki&s;&s;ed his fore|head;
the damps of death had &s;ettled there,
<PB N="218" REF="228">
and, forgetting her fortitude for a moment,
her tears mingled with them. St. Aubert
lifted up his eyes; the &s;pirit of a father re|turned
to them, but it quickly vani&s;hed,
and he &s;poke no more.</P>
<P>St. Aubert lingered till about three
o'clock in the afternoon, and, thus gradu|ally
&s;inking into death, he expired without
a &s;truggle, or a &s;igh.</P>
<P>Emily was led from the chamber by La
Voi&s;in and his daughter, who did what they
could to comfort her. The old man &s;at
and wept with her. Agnes was more erro|neou&s;ly
officious.</P>

<P>THE monk, who had before appeared,
returned in the evening to offer con&s;olation
to Emily, and brought a kind me&s;&s;age from
the lady abbe&s;s, inviting her to the convent.
Emily, though &s;he did not accept the offer,
returned an an&s;wer expre&s;&s;ive of her grati|tude.
The holy conver&s;ation of the friar,
who&s;e mild benevolence of manners bore
&s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of St. Aubert,
&s;oothed the violence of her grief, and lifted
her heart to the Being, who, extending
through all place and all eternity, looks
on the events of this little world as on
the &s;hadows of a moment, and beholds
equally, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant, the &s;oul
<PB N="220" REF="230">
that has pa&s;&s;ed the gates of death, and that,
which &s;till lingers in the body. "In the &s;ight
of God," &s;aid Emily, "my dear father now
exi&s;ts, as truly as he ye&s;terday exi&s;ted to
me; it is to me only that he is dead; to God
and to him&s;elf he yet lives!"</P>
<P>The good monk left her more tranquil
than &s;he had been &s;ince St. Aubert died;
and, before &s;he retired to her little cabin for
the night, &s;he tru&s;ted her&s;elf &s;o far as to
vi&s;it the corp&s;e. Silent, and without weep|ing,
&s;he &s;tood by its &s;ide. The features,
placid and &s;erene, told the nature of the la&s;t
&s;en&s;ations, that had lingered in the now de|&s;erted
frame. For a moment &s;he turned
away, in horror of the &s;tillne&s;s in which
death had fixed that countenance, never till
now &s;een otherwi&s;e than animated; then
gazed on it with a mixture of doubt and
awful a&s;toni&s;hment. Her rea&s;on could
&s;carcely overcome an involuntary and un|accountable
expectation of &s;eeing that be|loved
countenance &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible. She con|tinued
to gaze wildly; took up the cold
<PB N="221" REF="231">
hand; &s;poke; &s;till gazed, and then bur&s;t
into a tran&s;port of grief. La Voi&s;in, hear|ing
her &s;obs, came into the room to lead
her away, but &s;he heard nothing, and only
begged that he would leave her.</P>
<P>Again alone, &s;he indulged her tears, and,
when the gloom of evening ob&s;cured the
chamber, and almo&s;t veiled from her eyes
the object of her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;till hung over
the body; till her &s;pirits, at length, were
exhau&s;ted, and &s;he became tranquil. La
Voi&s;in again knocked at the door, and en|treated
that &s;he would come to the common
apartment. Before &s;he went, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the
lips of St. Aubert, as &s;he was wont to do
when &s;he bade him good night. Again &s;he
ki&s;&s;ed them; her heart felt as if it would
break, a few tears of agony &s;tarted to her
eyes, &s;he looked up to heaven, then at St.
Aubert, and left the room.</P>
<P>Retired to her lonely cabin, her melan|choly
thoughts &s;till hovered round the body
of her decea&s;ed parent; and, when &s;he &s;unk
into a kind of &s;lumber, the images of her
<PB N="222" REF="232">
waking mind &s;till haunted her fancy. She
thought &s;he &s;aw her father approaching her
with a benign countenance; then, &s;miling
mournfully and pointing upwards, his lips
moved, but, in&s;tead of words, &s;he heard
&s;weet mu&s;ic borne on the di&s;tant air, and
pre&s;ently &s;aw his features glow with the
mild rapture of a &s;uperior being. The
&s;train &s;eemed to &s;well louder, and &s;he awoke.
The vi&s;ion was gone, but mu&s;ic yet came
to her ear in &s;trains &s;uch as angels might
breathe. She doubted, li&s;tened, rai&s;ed her|&s;elf
in the bed, and again li&s;tened. It was
mu&s;ic, and not an illu&s;ion of her imagina|tion.
After a &s;olemn &s;teady harmony, it
pau&s;ed; then ro&s;e again, in mournful &s;weet|ne&s;s,
and then died, in a cadence, that &s;eem|ed
to bear away the li&s;tening &s;oul to heaven.
She in&s;tantly remembered the mu&s;ic of the
preceding night, with the &s;trange circum|&s;tances,
related by La Voi&s;in, and the affect|ing
conver&s;ation it had led to, concerning
the &s;tate of departed &s;pirits. All that St.
Aubert had &s;aid, on that &s;ubject, now pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="223" REF="233">
upon her heart, and overwhelmed it. What
a change in a few hours! He, who then
could only conjecture, was now made ac|quainted
with truth; was him&s;elf become
one of the departed! As the li&s;tened, &s;he
was chilled with &s;uper&s;titious awe, her tears
&s;topped; and &s;he ro&s;e, and went to the win|dow.
All without was ob&s;cured in &s;hade;
but Emily, turning her eyes from the ma&s;&s;y
darkne&s;s of the woods, who&s;e waving out|line
appeared on the horizon, &s;aw, on the
left, that effulgent planet, which the old
man had pointed out, &s;etting over the woods.
She remembered what he had &s;aid concern|ing
it, and, the mu&s;ic now coming at inter|vals
on the air, &s;he unclo&s;ed the ca&s;ement to
li&s;ten to the &s;trains, that &s;oon gradually
&s;unk to a greater di&s;tance, and tried to di&s;|cover
whence they came. The ob&s;curity
prevented her from di&s;tingui&s;hing any ob|ject
on the green platform below; and the
&s;ounds became fainter and fainter, till they
&s;oftened into &s;ilence. She li&s;tened, but they
returned no more. Soon after, &s;he ob&s;erved
<PB N="224" REF="234">
the planet trembling between the fringed
tops of the woods, and, in the next moment,
&s;ink behind them. Chilled with a melan|choly
awe, &s;he retired once more to her bed,
and, at length, forgot for a while her &s;orrows
in &s;leep.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he was vi&s;ited
by a &s;i&s;ter of the convent, who came, with
kind offices and a &s;econd invitation from
the lady abbe&s;s; and Emily, though &s;he
could not for&s;ake the cottage, while the re|mains
of her father were in it, con&s;ented,
however painful &s;uch a vi&s;it mu&s;t be, in the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits, to pay her re|&s;pects
to the abbe&s;s, in the evening.</P>
<P>About an hour before &s;un-&s;et, La Voi&s;in
&s;hewed her the way through the woods to
the convent, which &s;tood in a &s;mall bay of
the Mediterranean, crowned by a woody
amphitheatre; and Emily, had &s;he been le&s;s
unhappy, would have admired the exten&s;ive
&s;ea view, that appeared from the green &s;lope,
in front of the edifice, and the rich &s;hores,
hung with woods and pa&s;tures, that extended
<PB N="225" REF="235">
on either hand. But her thoughts were now
occupied by one &s;ad idea, and the features
of nature were to her colourle&s;s and without
form. The bell for ve&s;pers &s;truck, as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed the ancient gate of the convent, and
&s;eemed the funereal note for St. Aubert.
Little incidents affect a mind, enervated,
by &s;orrow; Emily, &s;truggled again&s;t the
&s;ickening faintne&s;s, that came over her,
and was led into the pre&s;ence of the abbe&s;s,
who received her with an air of maternal,
tenderne&s;s; an air of &s;uch gentle &s;olici|tude
and con&s;ideration, as touched her with
an in&s;tantaneous gratitude; her eyes were
filled with tears, and the words &s;he' would
have &s;poken faltered on her lips. The
abbe&s;s led her to a &s;eat, and &s;at down beside
her, &s;till holding her hand and regarding
her in &s;ilence, as Emily dried her tears and
attempted to &s;peak. "Be compo&s;ed, my
daughter," &s;aid the abbe&s;s in a &s;oothing
voice, "do not &s;peak yet; I know all you
would &s;ay. Your &s;pirits mu&s;t be &s;oothed.
We are going to prayers;&mdash;will you attend:

our evening &s;ervice? It is comfortable, my
child, to look up in our afflictions to a fa|ther,
who &s;ees and pities us, and who cha&s;|tens
in his mercy."</P>
<P>Emily's tears flowed again, but a thou&s;and
&s;weet emotions mingled with them. The
abbe&s;s &s;uffered her to weep without in|terruption,
and watched over her with a look
of benignity, that might have characterized
the countenance of a guardian angel. Emi|ly,
when &s;he became tranquil, was en|couraged
to &s;peak without re&s;erve, and to
mention the motive, that made her unwill|ing
to quit the cottage, which the abbe&s;s
did not oppo&s;e even by a hint; but prai&s;ed
the filial piety of her conduct, and added a
hope, that &s;he would pa&s;s a few days at the
convent, before &s;he returned to La Vall&eacute;e.
"You mu&s;t allow your&s;elf a little time to
recover from your fir&s;t &s;hock, my daughter,
before you encounter a &s;econd; I will not
affect to conceal from you how much I know
your heart mu&s;t &s;uffer, on returning to the
&s;cene of your former happine&s;s. Here, you
<PB N="227" REF="237">
will have all, that quiet and &s;ympathy and
religion can give, to re&s;tore your &s;pirits. But
come," added &s;he, ob&s;erving the tears &s;well
in Emily's eyes, "we will go to the chapel."</P>
<P>Emily followed to the parlour, where the
nuns were a&s;&s;embled, to whom the abbe&s;s
committed her, &s;aying, "This is a daugh|ter,
for whom I have much e&s;teem; be &s;i&s;ters
to her."</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed on in a train to the chapel,
where the &s;olemn devotion, with which the
&s;ervice was performed, elevated her mind,
and brought to it the comforts of faith and
re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Twilight came on, before the abbe&s;s's
kindne&s;s would &s;uffer Emily to depart, when
&s;he left the convent, with a heart much
lighter than &s;he had entered it, and was re|conducted
by La Voi&s;in through the woods,
the pen&s;ive gloom of which was in uni&s;on
with the temper of her mind; and &s;he pur|&s;ued
the little wild path, in mu&s;ing &s;ilence,
till her guide &s;uddenly &s;topped, looked
round, and then &s;truck out of the path into
<PB N="228" REF="238">
the high gra&s;s, &s;aying he had mi&s;taken the
road. He now walked on quickly, and
Emily, proceeding with difficulty over the
ob&s;cured and uneven ground, was left at
&s;ome di&s;tance, till her voice arre&s;ted him,
who &s;eemed unwilling to &s;top, and &s;till hur|ried
on. "If you are in doubt about the
way," &s;aid Emily, "had we not better en|quire
it at the chateau yonder, between the
trees?"</P>
<P>"No," replied La Voi&s;in, "there is no
occa&s;ion. When we reach that brook,
ma'am&s;elle, (you &s;ee the light upon the wa|ter
there, beyond the woods) when we
reach that brook, we &s;hall be at home pre|&s;ently.
I don't know how I happened to
mi&s;take the path; I &s;eldom come this way
after &s;un-&s;et."</P>
<P>"It is &s;olitary enough." &s;aid Emily, "but
you have no banditti here." "No, ma' am|&s;elle&mdash;no
banditti."</P>
<P>"What are you afraid of then, my good
friend? you are not &s;uper&s;titious?" "No,
not &s;uper&s;titious; but, to tell you the truth,
<PB N="229" REF="239">
lady, nobody likes to go near that chateau,
after du&s;k." "By whom is it inhabited,"
&s;aid Emily, "that it is &s;o formidable?"
"Why, ma'am&s;elle, it is &s;carcely inhabited,
for our lord the Marquis, and the lord of
all the&s;e fine woods, too, is dead. He had
not once been in it, for the&s;e many years,
and his people, who have the care of it, live
in a cottage clo&s;e by." Emily now under|&s;tood
this to be the chateau, which La
Voi&s;in had formerly pointed out, as having
belonged to the Marquis Villeroi, on the
mention of which her father had appeared
&s;o much affected.</P>
<P>"Ah! it is a de&s;olate place now," con|tinued
La Voi&s;in, "and &s;uch a grand, fine
place, as I remember it!" Emily enquired
what had occa&s;ioned this lamentable change;
but the old man was &s;ilent, and Emily,
who&s;e intere&s;t was awakened by the fear he
had expre&s;&s;ed, and above all by a recollec|tion
of her father's agitation, repeated the
que&s;tion, and added, "If you are neither
afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend,
<PB N="230" REF="240">
nor are &s;uper&s;titious, how happens it, that
you dread to pa&s;s near that chateau in the
dark?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps, then, I am a little &s;uper&s;titious,
ma'am&s;elle; and, if you knew what I do,
you might be &s;o too. Strange things have
happened there. Mon&s;ieur, your good fa|ther,
appeared to have known the late Mar|chione&s;s."
"Pray inform me what did
happen?" &s;aid Emily, with much emotion.</P>
<P>"Alas! ma'am&s;elle," an&s;wered La Voi&s;in,
"enquire no further: it is not for me to lay
open the dome&s;tic &s;ecrets of my lord."&mdash;Emily,
&s;urpri&s;ed by the old man's words,
and his manner of delivering them, forbore
to repeat her que&s;tion; a nearer intere&s;t, the
remembrance of St. Aubert, occupied her
thoughts, and &s;he was led to recollect the
mu&s;ic &s;he heard on the preceding night,
which &s;he mentioned to La Voi&s;in. "You
was not alone, ma'am&s;elle, in this," he re|plied,
"I heard it too; but I have &s;o often
heard it, at the &s;ame hour, that I was &s;carcely
&s;urpri&s;ed."</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="241">
"You doubtle&s;s believe this mu&s;ic to
have &s;ome connection with the chateau,"
&s;aid Emily &s;uddenly," and are, therefore,
&s;uper&s;titious." "It may be &s;o, ma'am&s;elle,
but there are other circum&s;tances, belonging
to that chateau, which I remember, and &s;ad|ly
too." A heavy &s;igh followed: but Emi|ly's
delicacy re&s;trained the curio&s;ity the&s;e
words revived, and &s;he enquired no further.</P>
<P>On reaching the cottage, all the violence
of her grief returned; it &s;eemed as if &s;he had
e&s;caped its heavy pre&s;&s;ure only while &s;he was
removed from the object of it. She pa&s;&s;ed
immediately to the chamber, where the re|mains
of her father were laid, and yielded to
all the angui&s;h of hopele&s;s grief. La Voi&s;in,
at length, per&s;uaded her to leave the room,
and &s;he returned to her own, where, ex|hau&s;ted
by the &s;ufferings of the day, &s;he &s;oon
fell into deep &s;leep, and awoke con&s;iderably
refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the dreadful hour arrived, in which
the remains of St. Aubert were to be taken
from her for ever, &s;he went alone to the
<PB N="232" REF="242">
chamber to look upon his countenance yet
once again, and La Voi&s;in, who had waited
patiently below &s;tairs, till her de&s;pair &s;hould
&s;ub&s;ide, with the re&s;pect due to grief, forbore
to interrupt the indulgence of it, till &s;urpri&s;e,
at the length of her &s;tay, and then appre|hen&s;ion
overcame his delicacy, and he went
to lead her from the chamber. Having tap|ped
gently at the door, without receiving an
an&s;wer, he li&s;tened attentively, but all was
&s;till; no &s;igh, no &s;ob of angui&s;h was heard.
Yet more alarmed by this &s;ilence, he opened
the door, and found Emily lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s|acro&s;s
the foot of the bed, near which &s;tood
the coffin. His calls procured a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and &s;he was carried to her room, where pro|per
applications, at length, re&s;tored her.</P>
<P>During her &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, La Voi&s;in
had given directions for the coffin to be
clo&s;ed, and he &s;ucceeded in per&s;uading
Emily to forbear revi&s;iting the chamber.
She, indeed, felt her&s;elf unequal to this, and
al&s;o perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;paring her
&s;pirits, and recollecting fortitude &s;ufficient to
<PB N="233" REF="243">
bear her through the approaching &s;cene. St.
Aubert had given a particular injunction,
that his remains &s;hould be interred in the
church of the convent of St. Clair, and,
in mentioning the north chancel, near the
ancient tomb of the Villerois, had pointed
out the exact &s;pot, where he wi&s;hed to be
laid. The &s;uperior had granted this place for
the interment, and thither, therefore, the &s;ad
proce&s;&s;ion now moved, which was met, at the
gates, by the venerable pri&egrave;&s;t, followed by a
train of friars. Every per&s;on, who heard the
&s;olemn chant of the anthem, and the peal of
the organ, that &s;truck up, when the body
entered the church, and &s;aw al&s;o the feeble
&s;teps, and the a&s;&s;umed tranquillity of Emily,
gave her involuntary tears. She &s;hed none,
but walked, her face partly &s;haded by a thin
black veil, between two per&s;ons, who &s;up|ported
her, preceded by the abbe&s;s, and
followed by nuns, who&s;e plaintive voices
mellowed the &s;welling harmony of the dirge.
When the proce&s;&s;ion came to the grave the
mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. Emily drew the veil entirely
<PB N="234" REF="244">
over her face, and, in a momentary pau&s;e,
between the anthem and the re&s;t of the &s;er|vice,
her &s;obs were di&s;tinctly audible. The
holy father began the &s;ervice, and Emily
again commanded her feelings, till the coffin
was let down, and &s;he heard the earth rattle
on its lid. Then, as &s;he &s;huddered, a groan
bur&s;t from her heart, and &s;he leaned for
&s;upport on the per&s;on who &s;tood next to
her. In a few moments &s;he recovered; and,
when &s;he heard tho&s;e affecting and &s;ublime
words: "His body is buried in peace, and
his &s;oul returns to Him that gave it," her
angui&s;h &s;oftened into tears.</P>
<P>The abbe&s;s led her from the church into
her own parlour, and there admini&s;tered all
the con&s;olations, that religion and gentle
&s;ympathy can give. Emily &s;truggled again&s;t
the pre&s;&s;ure of grief; but the abbe&s;s, ob|&s;erving
her attentively, ordered a bed to be
prepared, and recommended her to retire to
repo&s;e. She al&s;o kindly claimed her promi&s;e
to remain a few days at the convent, and Emi|ly,
who had no wi&s;h to return to the cottage,
<PB N="235" REF="245">
the &s;cene of all her &s;ufferings, had lei&s;ure,
now that no immediate care pre&s;&s;ed upon her
attention, to feel the indi&s;po&s;ition, which
di&s;abled her from immediately travelling.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the maternal kindne&s;s of the
abbe&s;s, and the gentle attentions of the nuns
did all, that was po&s;&s;ible, towards &s;oothing
her &s;pirits and re&s;toring her health. But the
latter was too deeply wounded, through the
medium of her mind, to be quickly revived.
She lingered for &s;ome weeks at the convent,
under the in&s;luence of a &s;low fever, wi&s;hing
to return home, yet unable to go thither;
often even reluctant to leave the &s;pot where
her father's relics were depo&s;ited, and &s;ome|times
&s;oothing her&s;elf with the con&s;ideration,
that, if &s;he died here, her remains would re|po&s;e
be&s;ide tho&s;e of St. Aubert. In the mean|while,
&s;he &s;ent letters to Madame Cheron
and to the old hou&s;ekeeper, informing them
of the &s;ad event, that had taken place, and
of her own &s;ituation. From her aunt &s;he
received an an&s;wer, abounding more in com|mon-place
condolement, than in traits of
<PB N="236" REF="246">
real &s;orrow, which a&s;&s;ured her, that a &s;ervant
&s;hould be &s;ent to conduct her to La Vall&egrave;e,
for that her own time was &s;o much occupied
by company, that &s;he had no lei&s;ure to under|take
&s;o long a journey. However Emily
might prefer La Vall&egrave;e to Tholou&s;e, &s;he
could not be in&s;en&s;ible of the indecorous
and unkind conduct of her aunt, in &s;uffer|ing
her to return thither, where &s;he had no
longer a relation to con&s;ole and protect her; a
conduct, which was the more culpable, &s;ince
St. Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron
the guardian of his orphan daughter.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron's &s;ervant made the at|tendance
of the good La Voi&s;in unnece&s;&s;ary;
and Emily, who felt &s;en&s;ibly her obligations
to him, for all his kind attention to her late
father, as well as to her&s;elf, was glad to &s;pare
him a long, and what, at his time of life,
mu&s;t have been a trouble&s;ome journey.</P>
<P>During her &s;tay at the convent, the peace
and &s;anctity that reigned within, the tranquil
beauty of the &s;cenery without, and the de|licate
<PB N="237" REF="247">
attentions of the abbe&s;s and the nuns,
were circum&s;tances &s;o &s;oothing to her mind,
that they almo&s;t tempted her to leave a
world, where &s;he had lo&s;t her deare&s;t friends,
and devote her&s;elf to the cloi&s;ter, in a &s;pot,
rendered &s;acred to her by containing the tomb
of St. Aubert. The pen&s;ive enthu&s;ia&s;m, too,
&s;o natural to her temper, had &s;pread a beau|tiful
illu&s;ion over the &s;anctified retirement of
a nun, that almo&s;t hid from her view the
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of its &s;ecurity. But the touches,
which a melancholy fancy, &s;lightly tinctured
with &s;uper&s;tition, gave to the mona&s;tic &s;cene,
began to fade, as her &s;pirits revived, and
brought once more to her heart an image,
which had only tran&s;iently been bani&s;hed
thence. By this &s;he was &s;ilently awakened
to hope and comfort and &s;weet affections;
vi&s;ions of happine&s;s gleamed faintly at a
di&s;tance, and, though &s;he knew them to be
illu&s;ions, &s;he could not re&s;olve to &s;hut them
out for ever. It was the remembrance of
Valancourt, of his ta&s;te, his genius, and of
the countenance which glowed with both,
<PB N="238" REF="248">
that, perhaps, alone determined her to return
to the world. The grandeur and &s;ublimity
of the &s;cenes, amid&s;t which they had fir&s;t met,
had fa&s;cinated her fancy, and had imper|ceptibly
contributed to render Valancourt
more intere&s;ting by &s;eeming to communicate
to him &s;omewhat of their own character.
The e&s;teem, too, which St. Aubert had re|peatedly
expre&s;&s;ed for him, &s;anctioned this
kindne&s;s; but, though his countenance and
manner had continually expre&s;&s;ed his admi|ration
of her, he had no otherwi&s;e declared
it; and even the hope of &s;eeing him again
was &s;o di&s;tant, that &s;he was &s;carcely con|&s;cious
of it, &s;till le&s;s that it influenced her
conduct on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was &s;everal days after the arrival of
Madame Cheron's &s;ervant before Emily was
&s;ufficiently recovered to undertake the jour|ney
to La Vall&eacute;e. On the evening pre|ceding
her departure, &s;he went to the cot|tage
to take leave of La Voi&s;in and his fa|mily,
and to make them a return for their
kindne&s;s. The old man &s;he found &s;itting
<PB N="239" REF="249">
on a bench at his door, between his daugh|ter,
and his &s;on-in-law, who was ju&s;t return|ed
from his daily labour, and who was play|ing
upon a pipe, that, in tone, re&s;embled
an oboe. A fla&s;k of wine &s;tood be&s;ide the
old man, and, before him, a &s;mall table with
fruit and bread, round which &s;tood &s;everal
of his grand&s;ons, fine ro&s;y children, who
were taking their &s;upper, as their mother
di&s;tributed it. On the edge of the little
green, that &s;pread before the cottage, were
cattle and a few &s;heep repo&s;ing under the
trees. The land&s;cape was touched with the
mellow light of the evening &s;un, who&s;e long
&s;lanting beams played through a vi&s;ta of
the woods, and lighted up the di&s;tant turrets
of the chateau. She pau&s;ed a moment, be|fore
&s;he emerged from the &s;hade, to gaze
upon the happy group before her&mdash;on the
complacency and ea&s;e of healthy age, de|pictured
on the countenance of La Voi&s;in;
the maternal tenderne&s;s of Agnes, as &s;he
looked upon her children, and the inno|cency
of infantine plea&s;ures, reflected in their
<PB N="240" REF="250">
&s;miles. Emily looked again at the venc|rable
old man, and at the cottage; the, me|mory
of her father ro&s;e with full force upon
her mind, and &s;he ha&s;tily &s;tepped forward,
afraid to tru&s;t her&s;elf with a longer pau&s;e.
She took an affectionate and affecting leave of
La Voi&s;in and his family; he &s;eemed to love
her as his daughter, and &s;hed tears; Emily
&s;hed many. She avoided going into the cot|tage,
&s;ince &s;he knew it would revive emo|tions,
&s;uch as &s;he could not now endure.</P>
<P>One painful &s;cene yet awaited her, for
&s;he determined to vi&s;it again her father's
grave; and that &s;he might not be interrupted,
or ob&s;erved in the indulgence of her melan|choly
tenderne&s;s, &s;he deferred her vi&s;it, till
every inhabitant of the convent, except the
nun who promi&s;ed to bring her the key of
the church, &s;hould be retired to re&s;t. Emily
remained in her chamber, till &s;he heard the
convent bell &s;trike twelve, when the nun
came, as &s;he had appointed, with the key of
a private door, that opened into the church,
and they de&s;cended together the narrow
<PB N="241" REF="251">
winding &s;tair-ca&s;e, that led thither. The
nun offered to accompany Emily to the
grave, adding, "It is melancholy to go
alone at this hour;" but the former, thank|ing
her for the con&s;ideration, could not con|&s;ent
to have any witne&s;s of her &s;orrow; and
the &s;i&s;ter, having unlocked the door, gave
her the lamp. "You will remember, &s;i&s;ter,"
&s;aid &s;he, "that in the ea&s;t ai&s;le, which you
mu&s;t pa&s;s, is a newly opened grave; hold
the light to the ground, that you may not
&s;tumble over the loo&s;e earth." Emily,
thanking her again, took the lamp, and,
&s;tepping into the church, &s;i&s;ter Mariette de|parted.
But Emily pau&s;ed a moment at
the door; a &s;udden fear came over her, and
&s;he returned to the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e,
where, as &s;he heard the &s;teps of the nun a&s;|cending,
and, while &s;he held up the lamp, &s;aw
her black veil waving over the &s;piral balu&s;|ters,
&s;he was tempted to call her back. While
&s;he he&s;itated, the veil di&s;appeared, and, in
the next moment, a&s;hamed of her fears, &s;he
returned to the church. The cold air of the
<PB N="242" REF="252">
ai&s;les chilled her, and their deep &s;ilence and
extent, feebly &s;hone upon by the moon-light,
that &s;treamed through a di&s;tant gothic win|dow,
would at any other time have awed her
into &s;uper&s;tition; now, grief occupied all her
attention. She &s;carcely heard the whi&s;per|ing
echoes of her own &s;teps, or thought of
the open grave, till &s;he found her&s;elf almo&s;t
on its brink. A friar of the convent had
been buried there on the preceding evening,
and, as &s;he had &s;at alone in her chamber at
twilight, &s;he heard, at di&s;tance, the monks
chanting the requiem for his &s;oul. This
brought fre&s;hly to her memory the circum|stances
of her father's death; and, as the
voices, mingling with a low querulous peal of
the organ, &s;welled faintly, gloomy and affect|ing
vi&s;ions had ari&s;en upon her mind. Now
&s;he remembered them, and, turning a&s;ide to
avoid the broken ground, the&s;e recollections
made her pa&s;s on with quicker &s;teps to the
grave of St. Aubert, when in the moon|light,
that fell athwart a remote part of the
ai&s;le, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw a &s;hadow gliding
<PB N="243" REF="253">
between the pillars. She &s;topped to li&s;ten,
and, not hearing any foot&s;tep, believed
that her fancy had deceived her, and, no
longer apprehen&s;ive of being ob&s;erved, pro|ceeded.
St. Aubert was buried beneath a
plain marble, bearing little more than his
name and the date of his birth and death,
near the foot of the &s;tately monument of the
Villerois. Emily remained at his grave,
till a chime, that called the monks to early
prayers, warned her to retire; then, &s;he wept
over it a la&s;t farewel, and forced her&s;elf
from the &s;pot. After this hour of melan|choly
indulgence, &s;he was refreshed by a
deeper &s;leep, than &s;he had experienced for a
long time, and, on awakening, her mind was
more tranquil and re&s;igned, than it had been
&s;ince St. Aubert's death.</P>
<P>But, when the moment of her departure
from the convent arrived, all her grief re|turned;
the memory of the dead, and the
kindne&s;s of the living attached her to the
place; and for the &s;acred &s;pot, where her
father's remains were interred, &s;he &s;eemed to
<PB N="244" REF="254">
feel all tho&s;e tender affections which we con|ceive
for home. The abbe&s;s repeated many
kind a&s;&s;urances of regard at their parting,
and pre&s;&s;ed her to return, if ever &s;he &s;hould
find her condition el&s;ewhere unplea&s;ant;
many of the nuns al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed unaffected
regret at her departure, and Emily left the
convent with many tears, and followed by
&s;incere wi&s;hes for her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She had travelled &s;everal leagues, before
the &s;cenes of the country, through which
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed, had power to rou&s;e her for a mo|ment
from the deep melancholy, into which
&s;he was &s;unk, and, when they did, it was only
to remind her, that, on her la&s;t view of them,
St. Aubert was at her &s;ide, and to call up to
herremembrance the remarks he had delivered
on &s;imilar &s;cenery. Thus, without any parti|cular
occurrence, pa&s;&s;ed the day in languor
and dejection. She &s;lept that night at a
town on the &s;kirts of Languedoc, and, on
the following morning, entered Ga&s;cony.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of this day, Emily
came within view of the plains in the neigh|bourhood
<PB N="245" REF="255">
of La Vall&eacute;e, and the well-known
objects of former times began to pre&s;s upon
her notice, and with them recollections,
that awakened all her tenderne&s;s and grief.
Often, while &s;he looked through her tears
upon the wild grandeur of the Pyren&eacute;es,
now varied with the rich lights and &s;hadows
of evening, &s;he remembered, that, when la&s;t
&s;he &s;aw them, her father partook with her
of the plea&s;ure they in&s;pired. Suddenly
&s;ome &s;cene, which he had particularly
pointed out to her, would pre&s;ent it&s;elf,
and the &s;ick languor of de&s;pair would &s;teal
upon her heart. "There!" &s;he would ex|claim,
"there are the very cliffs, there the
wood of pines, which he looked at with &s;uch
delight, as we pa&s;&s;ed this road together for
the la&s;t time. There, too, under the crag
of that mountain, is the cottage, peeping
from among the cedars, which he bade me
remember, and copy with my pencil. O
my father, &s;hall I never &s;ee you more!"</P>
<P>As &s;he drew near the chateau, the&s;e me|lancholy
memorials of pa&s;t times multiplied.
<PB N="246" REF="256">
At length, the chateau it&s;elf appeared amid
the glowing beauty of St. Aubert's fa|vourite
land&s;cape. This was an object,
which called for fortitude, not for tears;
Emily dried hers, and prepared to meet
with calmne&s;s the trying moment of her re|turn
to that home, where there was no
longer a parent to welcome her. "Yes,"
&s;aid &s;he, "let me not forget the le&s;&s;ons he
has taught me! How often he has pointed
out the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;ting even virtuous
&s;orrow; how often we have admired toge|ther
the greatne&s;s of a mind, that can at
once &s;uffer and rea&s;on! O my father! if
you are permitted to look down upon, your
child, it will plea&s;e you to &s;ee, that &s;he re|members,
and endeavours to practi&s;e, the
precepts you have given her."</P>
<P>A turn on the road now allowed a nearer
view of the chateau, the chimneys, tipped
with light, ri&s;ing from, behind St. Aubert's
favourite oaks, who&s;e foliage partly con|cealed
the lower part of the building. Emily
could not &s;uppre&s;s a heavy &s;igh. "This,
<PB N="247" REF="257">
too, was his favourite hour," &s;aid &s;he, as
&s;he gazed upon the long evening &s;hadows,
&s;tretched athwart the land&s;cape. "How
deep the repo&s;e, how lovely the &s;cene!
lovely and tranquil as in former days!"</P>
<P>Again &s;he re&s;i&s;ted the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;or|row,
till her ear caught the gay melody of
the dance, which &s;he had &s;o often li&s;tened
to, as &s;he walked with St. Aubert, on the
margin of the Garonne, when all her forti|tude
for&s;ook her, and &s;he continued to
weep, till the carriage &s;topped at the little
gate, that opened upon what was now her
own territory. She rai&s;ed her eyes on the
&s;udden &s;topping of the carriage, and &s;aw
her father's old hou&s;ekeeper coming to open
the gate. Manchon al&s;o came running,
and barking before her; and, when his
young mi&s;tre&s;s alighted, fawned, and played
round her, ga&s;ping with joy."</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid There&s;a, and
pau&s;ed, and looked as i&s; &s;he would have of|fered
&s;omething of condolement to Emily,
who&s;e tears now prevented reply. The dog
<PB N="246" REF="258">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="247" REF="259">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="248" REF="260">
&s;till fawned and ran round her, and then
flew towards the carriage, with a &s;hort
quick bark. "Ah, ma'am&s;lle!&mdash;my poor
ma&s;ter!" &s;aid There&s;a, who&s;e feelings were
more awakened than her delicacy, "Man|chon's
gone to look for him." Emily
&s;obbed aloud; and, on looking towards
the carriage, which &s;till &s;tood with the door
open, &s;aw the animal &s;pring into it, and in|&s;tantly
leap out, and then with his no&s;e on
the ground run round the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>"Don't cry &s;o, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid The|re&s;a,
"it breaks my heart to &s;ee you." The
dog now came running to Emily, then re|turned
to the carriage, and then back again
to her, whining and di&s;contented. "Poor
rogue!" &s;aid There&s;a, "thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy
ma&s;ter, thou may&s;t well cry! But come,
my dear young lady, be comforted. What
&s;hall I get to refre&s;h you?" Emily gave
her hand to the old &s;ervant, and tried to re|&s;train
her grief, while &s;he made &s;ome kind
enquiries concerning her health. But &s;he
&s;till lingered in the walk which led to the
<PB N="249" REF="261">
chateau, for within was no per&s;on to meet her
with the ki&s;s of affection; her own heart no
longer palpitated with impatient joy to
meet again the well-known &s;mile, and &s;he
dreaded to &s;ee objects, which would recall
the full remembrance of her &s;ormer happi|ne&s;s.
She moved &s;lowly towards the door,
pau&s;ed, went on, and pau&s;ed again. How
&s;ilent, how for&s;aken, how forlorn did the
chateau appear! Trembling to enter it, yet
blaming her&s;elf for delaying what &s;he could
not avoid, she, at length, patted into the
hall; cro&s;&s;ed it with a hurried &s;tep, as if
afraid to look round, and opened the door
of that room, which &s;he was wont to call
her own. The gloom of evening gave &s;o|lemnity
to its &s;ilent and de&s;erted air. The
chairs, the tables, every article of furniture,
&s;o familiar to her in happier times, &s;poke
eloquently to her heart. She &s;eated her&s;elf,
without immediately ob&s;erving it, in a win|dow,
which opened upon the garden, and
where St. Aubert had often &s;at with her,
watching the &s;un retire from the rich and
<PB N="250" REF="262">
exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, that appeared beyond
the groves.</P>
<P>Having indulged her tears for &s;ome time,
&s;he became more compo&s;ed; and, when
There&s;a, after &s;eeing the baggage depo&s;ited
in her lady's room, again appeared, &s;he had
&s;o far recovered her &s;pirits, as to be able to
conver&s;e with her.</P>
<P>"I have made up the green bed for you,
ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid There&s;a, as &s;he &s;et the cof|fee
upon the table. "I thought you would
like it better than your own now; but I
little thought this day month, that you
would come back alone. A-well-a-day!
the news almo&s;t broke my heart, when
it did come. Who would have believed,
that my poor ma&s;ter, when he went from,
home, would never return again!" Emily
hid her face with her handkerchief, and
waved her hand.</P>
<P>"Do ta&s;te the coffee, &s;aid There&s;a.
"My dear young lady, be comforted&mdash;we
mu&s;t all die. My dear ma&s;ter is a &s;aint
above." Emily took the handkerchief
<PB N="251" REF="263">
from her face, and rai&s;ed her eyes full of
tears towards heaven; &s;oon after &s;he dried
them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice,
began to enquire concerning &s;ome of her
late father's pen&s;ioners.</P>
<P>"Alas-a-day!" &s;aid There&s;a, as &s;he
poured out the co&s;&s;ee, and handed it to her
mi&s;tre&s;s, "all that could come, have been
here every day to enquire after you and my
ma&s;ter." She then proceeded to tell, that
&s;ome were dead whom they had left well;
and others, who were ill, had recovered.
"And &s;ee, ma'am&s;elle," added There&s;a,
"there is old Mary coming up the garden
now; &s;he has looked every day the&s;e three
years as if &s;he would die, yet &s;he is alive &s;till.
She has &s;een the chai&s;e at the door, and
knows you are come home."</P>
<P>The &s;ight of this poor old woman would
have been too much for Emily, and &s;he beg|ged
There&s;a would go and tell her, that &s;he
was too ill to &s;ee any per&s;on that night.
"To-morrow I &s;hall be better, perhaps;
<PB N="252" REF="264">
but give her this token of my remem|brance."</P>
<P>Emily &s;at for &s;ome time, given up to &s;or|row.
Not an object, on which her eye
glanced, but awakened &s;ome remembrance,
that led immediately to the &s;ubject of her
grief. Her favourite plants, which St. Au|bert
had taught her to nur&s;e; the little
drawings, that adorned the room, which
his ta&s;te had in&s;tructed her to execute; the
books, that he had &s;elected for her u&s;e, and
which they had read together; her mu&s;ical
in&s;truments, whose &s;ounds he loved &s;o well,
and which he &s;ometimes awakened him&s;elf&mdash;every
object gave new force to &s;orrow.
At length, &s;he rou&s;ed her&s;elf from this me|lancholy
indulgence, and, &s;ummoning all
her re&s;olution, &s;tepped forward to go into
tho&s;e forlorn rooms, which, though &s;he
dreaded to enter, &s;he knew would yet more
powerfully affect her, if &s;he delayed to vi&s;it
them.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through the green-hou&s;e,
her courage for a moment for&s;ook her, when
<PB N="253" REF="265">
&s;he opened the door of the library; and, per|haps,
the &s;hade, which evening and the fo|liage
of the trees near the windows threw
acro&s;s the room, heightened the &s;olemnity of
her feelings on entering that apartment, where
every thing &s;poke of her father. There
was an arm-chair, in which he u&s;ed to
&s;it; &s;he &s;hrunk when &s;he ob&s;erved it, for &s;he
had &s;o often &s;een him &s;eated there, and the
idea of him ro&s;e &s;o di&s;tinctly to her mind,
that &s;he almo&s;t fancied &s;he &s;aw him before
her. But &s;he checked the illu&s;ions of a
di&s;tempered imagination, though &s;he could
not &s;ubdue a certain degree of awe, which
now mingled with her emotions. She
walked &s;lowly to the chair, and &s;eated her|&s;elf
in it; there was a reading-de&s;k before
it, on which lay a book open, as it had been
left by her father. It was &s;ome moments
before &s;he recovered courage enough to ex|amine
it; and, when &s;he looked at the open
page, &s;he immediately recollected, that St.
Aubert, on the evening before his departure
from the chateau, had read to her &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages
<PB N="254" REF="266">
from this his favourite author. The
circum&s;tance now affected her extremely;
&s;he looked at the page, wept, and looked
again. To her the book appeared &s;acred
and invaluable, and &s;he would not have
moved it, or clo&s;ed the page, which he had
left open, for the trea&s;ures of the Indies.
Still &s;he &s;at before the de&s;k, and could not
re&s;olve to quit it, though the increa&s;ing
gloom, and the profound &s;ilence of the
apartment, revived a degree of painful awe.
Her thoughts dwelt on the probable &s;tate
of departed &s;pirits, and &s;he remembered the
affecting conver&s;ation, which had pa&s;&s;ed
between St. Aubert and La Voi&s;in, on the
night preceding his death.</P>
<P>As &s;he mu&s;ed &s;he &s;aw the door &s;lowly
open, and a ru&s;tling &s;ound in a remote part
of the room &s;tartled her. Through the
du&s;k &s;he thought &s;he perceived &s;omething
move. The &s;ubject &s;he had been con&s;ider|ing,
and the pre&s;ent tone of her &s;pirits,
which made her imagination re&s;pond to
every impre&s;&s;ion of her &s;en&s;es, gave her a
<PB N="255" REF="267">
&s;udden terror of &s;omething &s;upernatural.
She &s;at for a moment motionle&s;s, and then,
her di&s;&s;ipated rea&s;on returning, "What
&s;hould I fear?" &s;aid &s;he. "It the &s;pirits
of tho&s;e we love ever return to us, it is in
kindne&s;s."</P>
<P>The &s;ilence, which again reigned, made
her a&s;hamed of her late fears, and &s;he be|lieved,
that her imagination had deluded
her, or that &s;he had heard one of tho&s;e unac|countable
noi&s;es, which &s;ometimes occur in
old hou&s;es. The &s;ame &s;ound, however, re|turned;
and, di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;omething mov|ing
towards her, and in the next in&s;tant
pre&s;s be&s;ide her into the chair, &s;he &s;hrieked;
but her fleeting &s;en&s;es were in&s;tantly re|called,
on perceiving that it was Manchon
who &s;at by her, and who now licked her
hands affectionately.</P>
<P>Perceiving her &s;pirits unequal to the talk
&s;he had a&s;&s;igned her&s;elf of vi&s;iting the de|&s;erted
rooms of the chateau, this night,
when &s;he left the library, &s;he walked into the
garden, and down to the terrace, that over|hung
<PB N="256" REF="268">
the river. The &s;un was now &s;et; but,
under the dark branches of the almond
trees, was &s;een the &s;affron glow of the we&s;t,
&s;preading beyond the twilight of middle
air. The bat &s;litted &s;ilently by; and, now
and then, the mourning note of the nightin|gale
was heard. The circum&s;tances of the
hour brought to her recolle&s;tion &s;ome lines,
which &s;he had once heard St. Aubert recite
on this very &s;pot, and &s;he had now a melan|choly
ple&s;ure in repeating them.</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Now the bat circles on the breeze of evc,</L>
<L>That creeps, in &s;hudd'riag &s;its, along the wave,</L>
<L>And trembles 'mid the woods, and through the cave</L>
<L>Who&s;e lonely &s;ighs the wanderer deceive;</L>
<L>For o&s;t, when melancholy charms his mind,</L>
<L>He thinks the Spirit of the rock he hears,</L>
<L>Nor li&s;tens, but with &s;weetly-thrilling fears,</L>
<L>To the low, my&s;tic murmurs of the wind!</L>
<L>Now the bat circles, and the twilight-dew</L>
<L>Falls &s;ilent round, and, o'er the mountain-cliff,</L>
<L>The gleaming wave and far-di&s;cover'd &s;kiff</L>
<L>Spreads the gray veil of &s;oft, harmonious hue.</L>
<L>So falls o'er Grief the dew of pity's tear</L>
<L>Dimming her lonely vi&s;ions of de&s;pair.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="257" REF="269">
Emily, wandering on, came to St. Au|bert's
favourite plane-tree, where &s;o often,
at this hour, they had &s;at beneath the &s;hade
together, and with her dear mother &s;o
often had conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject of a &s;u|ture
&s;tate. How often, too, had her father
expre&s;&s;ed the comfort he derived from be|lieving,
that they &s;hould meet in another
world! Emily, overcome by the&s;e recollec|tions,
left the plane-tree, and, as &s;he leaned
pen&s;ively on the wall of the terrace, &s;he
ob&s;erved a group of pea&s;ants dancing gaily
on the banks of the Garonne, which &s;pread
in broad expan&s;e below, and reflected
the evening light. What a contra&s;t they
formed to the de&s;olate, unhappy Emily!
They were gay and <HI>debonnaire,</HI> as they were
wont to be when &s;he, too, was gay&mdash;when
St. Aubert u&s;ed to li&s;ten to their merry mu|&s;ic,
with a countenance beaming plea&s;ure
and benevolence. Emily, having looked
for a moment on this &s;prightly band, turned
away, unable to bear the remembrances it
excited; but where, alas! could &s;he turn,
<PB N="258" REF="270">
and not meet new objects to give acutene&s;s
to grief?</P>
<P>As &s;he walked &s;lowly towards the hou&s;e,
&s;he was met by There&s;a. "Dear ma'am|&s;elle,"
&s;aid &s;he, "I have been &s;eeking you
up and down this half hour, and was afraid
&s;ome accident had happened to you. How
can you like to wander about &s;o in this
night air! Do come into the hou&s;e. Think
what my poor ma&s;ter would have &s;aid, if
he could &s;ee you. I am &s;ure, when my
dear lady died, no gentleman could take it
more to heart than he did, yet you know he
&s;eldom &s;hed a tear."</P>
<P>"Pray, There&s;a, cea&s;e," &s;aid Emily, wi&s;h|ing
to interrupt this ill-judged, but well-mean|ing
harangue; There&s;a's loquacity, however,
was not to be &s;ilenced &s;o ea&s;ily. "And
when you u&s;ed to grieve &s;o," &s;he added,
"he often told you how wrong it was&mdash;for
that my mi&s;tre&s;s was happy. And, if &s;he
was happy, I am &s;ure he is &s;o too; for the
prayers of the poor, they &s;ay, reach hea|ven."
During this &s;peech, Emily had
<PB N="259" REF="271">
walked &s;ilently into the chateau, and The|re&s;a
lighted her acro&s;s the hall into the com|mon
&s;itting parlour, where &s;he had laid the
cloth, with one &s;olitary knife and fork, for
&s;upper. Emily was in the room before &s;he
perceived that it was not her own apartment,
but &s;he checked the emotion which inclined
her to leave it, and &s;eated her&s;elf quietly by
the little &s;upper table. Her father's hat
hung upon the oppo&s;ite wall; while &s;he
gazed at it, a faintne&s;s came over her.
There&s;a looked at her, and then at the ob|ject,
on which her eyes were &s;ettled, and
went to remove it; but Emily waved her
hand&mdash;"No," &s;aid &s;he, "let it remain. I
am going to my chamber." "Nay, ma'am|&s;elle,
&s;upper is ready." "I cannot take
it," replied Emily, "I will go to my room,
and try to &s;leep. To-morrow I &s;hall be
better."</P>
<P>"This is poor doings!" &s;aid There&s;a.
"Dear lady! do take &s;ome food! I have
dre&s;&s;ed a phea&s;ant, and a fine one it is. Old

<P>"Did he?" &s;aid Emily, in a tender voice,
while &s;he felt her poor heart warmed for a
moment by a ray of &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>At length, her &s;pirits were entirely over|come,
and &s;he retired to her room.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY, &s;ome time after her return to
La Vall&eacute;e, received letters from her aunt,
Madame Cheron, in which, after &s;ome com|mon-place
condolement and advice, &s;he in|vited
her to Tholou&s;e, and added, that, as
her late brother had entru&s;ted Emily's <HI>edu|cation</HI>
to her, &s;he &s;hould con&s;ider her&s;elf
bound to overlook her conduct. Emily, at
this time, wi&s;hed only to remain at La Val|l&eacute;e,
<PB N="262" REF="274">
in the &s;cenes of her early happine&s;s
now rendered infinitely dear to her, as the
late re&s;idence of tho&s;e, whom &s;he had lo&s;t
for ever, where &s;he could weep unob&s;erved,
retrace their &s;teps, and remember each mi|nute
particular of their manners. But &s;he
was equally anxious to avoid the di&s;plea&s;ure
of Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>Though her affection would not &s;uffer her
to que&s;tion, even a moment, the propriety
of St. Aubert's conduct in appointing Ma|dame
for her guardian, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, that
this &s;tep had made her happine&s;s depend,
in a great degree, on the humour of her aunt.
In her reply, &s;he begged permi&s;&s;ion to re|main,
at pre&s;ent, at La Vall&eacute;e, mentioning
the extreme dejection of her &s;pirits, and the
nece&s;&s;ity &s;he felt for quiet and retirement to
re&s;tore them. The&s;e &s;he knew were not to
be found at Madame Cheron's, who&s;e in|clinations
led her into a life of di&s;&s;ipation,
which her ample fortune encouraged; and,
having given her an&s;wer, &s;he felt &s;omewhat
more at ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="275">
In the fir&s;t days of her affliction, &s;he was
vi&s;ited by Mon&s;ieur Barreaux, a &s;incere
mourner for St. Aubert. "I may well la|ment
my friend," &s;aid he, "for I &s;hall never
meet with his re&s;emblance. If I could have
found &s;uch a man in what is called &s;ociety,
I &s;hould not have left it."</P>
<P>M. Barreaux's admiration of her father
endeared him extremely to Emily, who&s;e
heart found almo&s;t its fir&s;t relief in conver|&s;ing
of her parents, with a man, whom &s;he
&s;o much revered, and who, though with
&s;uch an ungracious appearance, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o
much goodne&s;s of heart and delicacy of
mind.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in quiet retire|ment,
and Emily's affliction began to &s;often
into melancholy. She could bear to read
the books &s;he had before read with her
father; to &s;it in his chair in the library&mdash;to
watch the flowers his hand had planted&mdash;to
awaken the tones of that in&s;trument his fin|gers
had pre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes even to play
his favourite air.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="276">
When her mind had recovered from the
fir&s;t &s;hock of affliction, perceiving the dan|ger
of yielding to indolence, and that activity
alone could re&s;tore its tone, &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly
endeavoured to pa&s;s all her hours in em|ployment.
And it was now that &s;he under|&s;tood
the full value of the education &s;he had
received from St. Aubert, for in cultivating
her under&s;tanding he had &s;ecured her an
a&s;ylum from indolence, without recour&s;e to
di&s;&s;ipation, and rich and varied amu&s;ement
and information, independent of the &s;ociety,
from which her &s;ituation &s;ecluded her. Nor
were the good effects of this education con|fined
to &s;elfi&s;h advantages, &s;ince, St. Aubert
having nouri&s;hed every amiable quality of
her heart, it now expanded in benevolence
to all around her, and taught her, when &s;he
could not remove the misfortunes of others,
at lead to &s;often them by &s;ympathy and ten|derne&s;s;&mdash;a
benevolence that taught her to
feel for all, that could &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron returned no an&s;wer to
Emily's letter, who began to hope, that &s;he
<PB N="265" REF="277">
&s;hould be permitted to remain &s;ome time
longer in her retirement, and her mind had
now &s;o far recovered its &s;trength, that &s;he
ventured to view the &s;cenes, which mo&s;t
powerfully recalled the images of part times.
Among the&s;e was the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e; and,
to indulge &s;till more the affectionate melan|choly
of the vi&s;it, &s;he took thither her lute,
that &s;he might again hear there the tones, to
which St. Aubert and her mother had &s;o
often delighted to li&s;ten. She went alone,
and at that &s;till hour of the evening, which
is &s;o &s;oothing to fancy and to grief. The
la&s;t time &s;he had been here &s;he was in com|pany
with Mon&s;ieur and Madame St. Aubert,
a few days preceding that, on which
the latter was &s;eized with a fatal illne&s;s.
Now, when Emily again entered the woods,
that &s;urrounded the building, they awakened
&s;o forcibly the memory of former times,
that her re&s;olution yielded for a moment to
exce&s;s of grief. She &s;topped, leaned for
&s;upport again&s;t a tree, and wept for &s;ome
minutes, before &s;he had recovered her&s;elf
<PB N="266" REF="278">
&s;ufficiently to proceed. The little path, that
led to the building, was overgrown with
gra&s;s, and the flowers which St. Aubert had
&s;cattered carele&s;sly along the border were al|mo&s;t
choked with weeds&mdash;the tall thi&s;tle&mdash;the
fox-glove, and the nettle. She often
pau&s;ed to look on the de&s;olate &s;pot, now &s;o
&s;ilent and for&s;aken, and when, with a trem|bling
hand, &s;he opened the door of the fi&s;h|ing-hou&s;e,
"Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, "every thing&mdash;every
thing remains as when I left it la&s;t&mdash;left
it with tho&s;e who never mu&s;t return!"
She went to a window, that overhung the
rivulet, and, leaning over it, with her eyes
fixed on the current, was &s;oon lo&s;t in melan|choly
reverie. The lute &s;he had brought
lay forgotten be&s;ide her; the mournful &s;igh|ing
of the breeze, as it waved the high pines
above, and its &s;ofter whi&s;pers among the
o&s;iers, that bowed upon the banks below,
was a kind of mu&s;ic more in uni&s;on with
her feelings. It did not vibrate on the
chords of unhappy memory, but was &s;ooth|ing
to the heart as the voice of Pity. She
<PB N="267" REF="279">
continued to mu&s;e, uncon&s;cious of the gloom
of evening, and that the &s;un's la&s;t light
trembled on the heights above, and would
probably have remained &s;o much longer, if
a &s;udden foot&s;tep, without the building, had
not alarmed her attention, and fir&s;t made
her recollect that &s;he was unprotected. In
the next moment, a door opened, and a
&s;tranger appeared, who &s;topped on perceive|ing
Emily, and then began to apologize for
his intru&s;ion. But Emily, at the &s;ound of
his voice, lo&s;t her fear in a &s;tronger emo|tion;
its tones were familiar to her ear, and,
though &s;he could not readily di&s;tingui&s;h
through the du&s;k the features of the per&s;on
who &s;poke, &s;he felt a remembrance too
&s;trong to be di&s;tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>He repeated his apology, and Emily then &s;aid
&s;omething in reply, when the &s;tranger,
eagerly advancing, exclaimed, "Good God!
can it be&mdash;&s;urely I am not mi&s;taken&mdash;ma'am&s;elle
St. Aubert&mdash;is it not?"</P>
<P>"It is indeed," &s;aid Emily, who was
confirmed in her fir&s;t conjecture, for &s;he
<PB N="268" REF="280">
now di&s;tingui&s;hed the countenance of Va|lancourt,
lighted up with &s;till more than its
u&s;ual animation. A thou&s;and painful re|collections
crowded to her mind, and the
effort, which &s;he made to &s;upport her&s;elf,
only &s;erved to increa&s;e her agitation. Va|lancourt,
meanwhile, having enquired anxi|ou&s;ly
after her health, and expre&s;&s;ed his
hopes, that M. St. Aubert had found benefit
from travelling, learned from the flood of
tears, which &s;he could no longer repre&s;s,
the fatal truth. He led her to a &s;eat, and
&s;at down by her, while Emily continued to
weep, and Valancourt to hold the hand,
which &s;he was uncon&s;cious he had taken,
till it was wet with the tears, which grief for
St. Aubert and &s;ympathy for her&s;elf had
called forth.</P>
<P>"I feel," &s;aid he at length, "I feel how
in&s;ufficient all attempt at con&s;olation mu&s;t
be on this &s;ubject. I can only mourn with
you, for I cannot doubt the &s;ource of your tears.
Would to God I were mi&s;taken!"</P>
<P>Emily could &s;till an&s;wer only by tears,
<PB N="269" REF="281">
till &s;he ro&s;e, and begged they might leave
the melancholy &s;pot, when Valancourt,
though he &s;aw her feeblene&s;s, could not
offer to detain her, but took her arm with|in
his, and led her from the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e.
They walked &s;ilently through the woods,
Valancourt anxious to know, yet fearing to
a&s;k any particulars concerning St. Aubert;
and Emily too much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to conver&s;e.
After &s;ome time, however, &s;he acquired for|titude
enough to &s;peak of her father, and to
give a brief account of the manner of his
death; during which recital Valancourt's
countenance betrayed &s;trong emotion, and,
when he heard that St. Aubert had died on
the road, and that Emily had been left
among &s;trangers, he pre&s;&s;ed her hand be|tween
his, and involuntarily exclaimed,
"Why was I not there!" but in the next
moment recollected him&s;elf, for he imme|diately
returned to the mention of her fa|ther;
till, perceiving that her &s;pirits were
exhau&s;ted, he gradually changed the &s;ubject,
and &s;poke of him&s;elf. Emily thus learned,
<PB N="270" REF="282">
that, after they had parted, he had wan|dered,
for &s;ome time, along the &s;hores of
the Mediterranean, and had then returned
through Languedoc into Ga&s;cony, which
was his native province, and where he u&s;ually
re&s;ided.</P>
<P>When he had concluded his little narra|tive,
he &s;unk into a &s;ilence, which Emily was
not di&s;po&s;ed to interrupt, and it continued,
till they reached the gate of the chateau,
when he &s;topped, as if he had known
this to be the limit of his walk. Here, &s;aying,
that it was his intention to return to E&s;tu|viere
on the following day, he a&s;ked her if
&s;he would permit him to take leave of her
in the morning; and Emily, perceiving that
&s;he could not reject an ordinary civility,
without expre&s;&s;ing by her refu&s;al an expec|tation
of &s;omething more, was compelled to
an&s;wer, that &s;he &s;hould be at home.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed a melancholy evening, during
which the retro&s;pect of all that had hap|pened,
&s;ince &s;he had &s;een Valancourt, would
ri&s;e to her imagination; and the &s;cene of her
<PB N="271" REF="283">
father's death appeared in tints as fre&s;h, as
if it had pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding day. She
remembered particularly the earne&s;t and &s;o|lemn
manner, in which he had required her
to de&s;troy the manu&s;cript papers, and, awa|kening
from the lethargy, in which &s;orrow
had held her, &s;he was &s;hocked to think &s;he
had not yet obeyed him, and determined,
that another day &s;hould not reproach her
with the neglect.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the next morning, Emily ordered a
fire to be lighted in the &s;tove of the cham|ber,
where St. Aubert u&s;ed to &s;leep; and,
as &s;oon as &s;he had breakfa&s;ted, went thi|ther
to burn the papers. Having fa&s;tened
the door to prevent interruption, &s;he opened
the clo&s;et where they were concealed, as
&s;he entered which, &s;he felt an emotion of
unu&s;ual awe, and &s;tood for &s;ome moments
&s;urveying it, trembling, and almo&s;t afraid
to remove the board. There was a great
chair in one corner of the clo&s;et, and, op|po&s;ite
to it, &s;tood the table, at which &s;he
had &s;een her father &s;it, on the evening
that preceded his departure, looking over,
<PB N="273" REF="285">
with &s;o much emotion, what &s;he believed
to be the&s;e very papers.</P>
<P>The &s;olitary life, which Emily had led
of late, and the melancholy &s;ubjects, on
which &s;he had &s;uffered her thoughts to dwell,
had rendered her at times &s;en&s;ible to the
"thick-coming fancies" of a mind greatly
enervated. It was lamentable, that her ex|cellent
under&s;tanding &s;hould have yielded,
even for a moment, to the reveries of &s;u|per&s;tition,
or rather to tho&s;e &s;tarts of ima|gination,
which deceive the &s;en&s;es into what
can be called nothing le&s;s than momentary
madne&s;s. In&s;tances of this temporary failure
of mind had more than once occurred &s;ince
her return home; particularly when, wan|dering
through this lonely man&s;ion in the
evening twilight, &s;he had been alarmed by
appearances, which would have been un|&s;een
in her more cheerful days. To this in|firm
&s;tate of her nerves may be attributed,
what, &s;he imagined, when, her eyes glancing
a &s;econd time on the arm-chair, which
&s;tood in an ob&s;cure part of the clo&s;et, the
<PB N="274" REF="286">
countenance of her dead father appeared
there. Emily &s;tood fixed for a moment to
the floor, after which &s;he left the clo&s;et. Her
&s;pirits, however, &s;oon returned; &s;he re|proached
her&s;elf with the weakne&s;s of thus
&s;uffering interruption in an act of &s;erious
importance, and again opened the door.
By the directions which St. Aubert had
given her, &s;he readily found the board he
had de&s;cribed in an oppo&s;ite corner of the
clo&s;et, near the window; &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
al&s;o the line he had mentioned, and, pre&s;|&s;ing
it as he had bade her, it &s;lid down,
and di&s;clo&s;ed the bundle of papers, together
with &s;ome &s;cattered ones, and the pur&s;e of
louis. With a trembling hand &s;he re|moved
them, replaced the board, pau&s;ed a
moment, and was ri&s;ing from the floor,
when, on looking up, there appeared to
her alarmed fancy the &s;ame countenance in
the chair. The illu&s;ion, another in&s;tance
of the unhappy effect which &s;olitude and
grief had gradually produced upon her
mind, &s;ubdued her &s;pirits; &s;he ru&s;hed for|ward
<PB N="275" REF="287">
into the chamber, and &s;unk almo&s;t
&s;en&s;ele&s;s into a chair. Returning rea&s;on
&s;oon overcame the dreadful, but pitiable at|tack
of imagination, and &s;he turned to the
papers, though &s;till with &s;o little recollect|tion,
that her eyes involuntarily &s;ettled on
the writing of &s;ome loo&s;e &s;heets, which lay
open; and &s;he was uncon&s;cious, that &s;he
was tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing her father's &s;trict injunc|tion,
till a &s;entence of dreadful import
awakened her attention and her memory to|gether.
She ha&s;tily put the papers from
her; but the words, which had rou&s;ed
equally her curio&s;ity and terror, &s;he could not
di&s;mi&s;s from her thoughts. So powerfully
had they affected her, that &s;he even could
not re&s;olve to de&s;troy the papers immedi|ately;
and the more &s;he dwelt on the cir|cum&s;tance,
the more it inflamed her imagi|nation.
Urged by the mo&s;t forcible, and
apparently the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, curio&s;ity to
enquire farther, concerning the terrible and
my&s;terious &s;ubject, to which &s;he had &s;een
an allu&s;ion, &s;he began to lament her pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="276" REF="288">
to de&s;troy the papers. For a moment,
&s;he even doubted, whether it could ju&s;tly
be obeyed, in contradiction to &s;uch rea&s;ons
as there appeared to be for further informa|tion.
But the delu&s;ion was momentary.</P>
<P>"I have given a &s;olemn promi&s;e," &s;aid
&s;he, "to ob&s;erve a &s;olemn injunction, and
it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to argue, but to obey.
Let me ha&s;ten to remove the temptation,
that would de&s;troy my innocence, and em|bitter
my life with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of irre|mediable
guilt, while I have, &s;trength to, re|ject
it."</P>
<P>Thus re-animated with a &s;en&s;e of her
duty, &s;he completed the triumph of inte|grity
over temptation, more forcible than
any &s;he had ever known, and con&s;igned the
papers to the flames. Her eyes watched
them as they &s;lowly con&s;umed, &s;he &s;hud|dered
at the recollection of the &s;entence &s;he
had ju&s;t &s;een, and at the certainty, that the
only opportunity of explaining it was then
pa&s;&s;ing away for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="289">
It was long after this, that &s;he recollected
the pur&s;e; and as &s;he was depo&s;iting it, un|opened,
in a cabinet, perceiving that it con|tained
&s;omething of a &s;ize larger than coin,
&s;he examined it. "His hand depo&s;ited
them here," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he ki&s;&s;ed &s;ome
pieces of the coin, and wetted them with
her tears, "his hand&mdash;which is now du&s;t!"
At the bottom of the pur&s;e was a &s;mall
packet, having taken out which, and un|folded
paper after paper, &s;he found to be an
ivory ca&s;e, containing, the miniature of a&mdash;lady!
She &s;tarted&mdash;"The &s;ame," &s;aid
&s;he, "my father, wept over!" On exa|mining
the countenance &s;he could recollect
no per&s;on that it re&s;embled. It was of un|common
beauty, and was characterized by
an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s, &s;haded with, &s;or|row,
and tempered by re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>St. Aubert had given no directions con|cerning
this picture, nor had even named
it; &s;he, therefore, thought her&s;elf ju&s;tified
in pre&s;erving it. More than once remem|bering
his manner, when he had &s;poken of
<PB N="278" REF="290">
the Marchione&s;s of Villeroi, &s;he felt inclined
to believe that this was her re&s;emblance;
yet there appeared no rea&s;on why he &s;hould
have pre&s;erved a picture of that lady, or,
having pre&s;erved it, why he &s;hould lament
over it in a manner &s;o &s;triking and affecting
as &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed on the night preceding
his departure.</P>
<P>Emily &s;till gazed on the countenance,
examining its features, but &s;he knew not
where to detect the charm that captivated
her attention, and in&s;pired &s;entiments of
&s;uch love and pity. Dark brown hair
played carele&s;sly along the open forehead;
the no&s;e was rather inclined to aquiline;
the lips &s;poke in a &s;mile, but it was a melan|choly
one; the eyes were blue, and were di|rected
upwards with an expre&s;&s;ion of pecu|liar
meekne&s;s, while the &s;oft cloud of the
brow &s;poke the fine &s;en&s;ibility of the temper.</P>
<P>Emily was rou&s;ed from the mu&s;ing mood
into which the picture had thrown her, by
the clo&s;ing of the garden gate; and, on
turning her eyes to the window, &s;he &s;aw
Valancourt coming towards the chateau.
<PB N="279" REF="291">
Her &s;pirits agitated by the &s;ubjects that
had lately occupied her mind, &s;he felt un|prepared
to &s;ee him, and remained a few
moments in the chamber to recover her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>When &s;he met him in the parlour, &s;he was
&s;truck with the change that appeared in his
air and countenance &s;ince they had parted
in Rou&s;illon, which twilight and the di&s;tre&s;s
&s;he &s;uffered on the preceding evening had
prevented her from ob&s;erving. But de|jection
and languor di&s;appeared, for a mo|ment,
in the &s;mile that now enlightened his
countenance, on perceiving her. "You
&s;ee," &s;aid he, "I have availed my&s;elf of the
permi&s;&s;ion with which you honoured me&mdash;of
bidding <HI>you</HI> farewell, whom I had
the happine&s;s of meeting only ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled faintly, and, anxious to &s;ay
&s;omething, a&s;ked if he had been long in Ga&s;|cony.
"A few days only," replied Valan|court,
while a blu&s;h pa&s;&s;ed over his cheek
"I engaged in a long ramble after I
had the misfortune of parting with the
<PB N="280" REF="292">
friends who had made my wanderings
among the Pyrenees &s;o delightful."</P>
<P>A tear came to Emily's eye, as Valan|court
&s;aid this, which he ob&s;erved; and,
anxious to draw off her attention from the
remembrance that had occa&s;ioned it, as
well as &s;hocked at his own thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
he began to &s;peak on other &s;ubjects; ex|pre&s;&s;ing
his admiration of the chateau, and
its pro&s;pects. Emily, who felt &s;omewhat
embarra&s;&s;ed how to &s;upport a conver&s;ation,
was glad of &s;uch an opportunity to conti|nue
it on indifferent topics. They walked
down to the terrace, where Valancourt was
charmed with the river &s;cenery, and the
views over the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of Guienne.</P>
<P>As he leaned on the wall of the terrace,
watching the rapid current of the Garonne,
"I was a few weeks ago," &s;aid he, "at the
&s;ource of this noble river; I had not then
the happine&s;s of knowing you, or I &s;hould
have regretted your ab&s;ence&mdash;it was a &s;cene
&s;o exactly &s;uited to your ta&s;te. It ri&s;es in a
part of the Pyren&eacute;es, &s;till wilder and more
<PB N="281" REF="293">
&s;ublime I think, than any we pa&s;&s;ed in the
way to Rou&s;illon." He then de&s;cribed its
fall among th&eacute; precipices of the mountains,
where its waters, augmented by the &s;treams
that de&s;cend from the &s;nowy &s;ummits
around, ru&s;h into the Vall&eacute;e d'Aran, be|tween
who&s;e romantic heights it foams
along, pur&s;uing its way to the north we&s;t
till it emerges upon the plains of Langue|doc.
Then, wa&s;hing the walls of Tholou&s;e,
and turning again to the north we&s;t, it a&s;|&s;umes
a milder character, as it fertilizes the
pa&s;tures of Ga&s;cony and Guienne, in its pro|gre&s;s
to the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>Emily and Valancourt talked of the &s;cenes
they had pa&s;&s;ed among the Pyrenean Alps;
as he &s;poke of which there was often a tremu|lous
tenderne&s;s in his voice, and &s;ometimes
he expatiated on them with all the fire of
genius, &s;ometimes would appear &s;carcely
con&s;cious of the topic, though he continued
to &s;peak. This &s;ubject recalled forcibly to
Emily the idea of her father, who&s;e image
appeared in every land&s;cape which Valan|court
<PB N="282" REF="294">
particularized, who&s;e remarks dwelt
upon her memory, and who&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;m
&s;till glowed in her heart. Her &s;ilence, at
length, reminded Valancourt how nearly
his conver&s;ation approached to the occa&s;ion
of her grief, and he changed the &s;ubject,
though for one &s;carcely le&s;s affecting to
Emily. When he admired the grandeur of
the plane-tree, that &s;pread its wide branches
over the terrace, and under who&s;e &s;hade they
now &s;at, &s;he remembered how often &s;he had
&s;at thus with St. Aubert, and heard him ex|pre&s;s
the &s;ame admiration.</P>
<P>"This was a favourite tree with my dear
father," &s;aid &s;he; "he u&s;ed to love to &s;it
under its foliage with his family about him,
in the fine evenings of &s;ummer."</P>
<P>Valancourt under&s;tood her feelings, and
was &s;ilent; had &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes from the
ground &s;he would have &s;een tears in his.
He ro&s;e, and leaned on the wall of the ter|race,
from which, in a few moments, he re|turned
to his &s;eat, then ro&s;e again, and ap|peared
to be greatly agitated; while Emily
<PB N="283" REF="295">
found her &s;pirits &s;o much depre&s;&s;ed, that &s;eve|ral
of her attempts to renew the conver&s;ation
were ineffectual. Valancourt again &s;at down,
but was &s;till &s;ilent, and trembled. At length
he &s;aid, with a he&s;itating voice, "This lovely
&s;cene!&mdash;I am going to leave&mdash;to leave you&mdash;perhaps
for ever! The&s;e moments may never
return; I cannot re&s;olve to neglect, though
I &s;carcely dare to avail my&s;elf of them. Let
me, however, without offending the delicacy
of your &s;orrow, venture to declare the admi|ration
I mu&s;t always feel of your goodne&s;s,&mdash;O!
that at &s;ome future period I might be
permitted to call it love!"</P>
<P>Emily's emotion would not &s;uffer her to
reply; and Valancourt, who now ventured
to look up, ob&s;erving her countenance
change, expected to &s;ee her faint, and made
an involuntary effort to &s;upport her, which
recalled Emily to a &s;en&s;e of her &s;ituation,
and to an exertion of her &s;pirits. Valan|court
did not appear to notice her indi&s;po|&s;ition,
but, when he &s;poke again, his voice
told the tendere&s;t love. "I will not pre|&s;ume,"
<PB N="284" REF="296">
he added, "to intrude this &s;ubject
longer upon your attention at this time, but I
may, perhaps, be permitted to mention, that
the&s;e parting moments would lo&s;e much of
their bitterne&s;s if I might be allowed to hope
the declaration I have made would not ex|clude
me from your pre&s;ence in future."</P>
<P>Emily made another effort to overcome
the confu&s;ion of her thoughts, and to &s;peak.
She feared to tru&s;t the preference her heart
acknowledged towards Valancourt, and to
give him any encouragement for hope, on
&s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. For though in
this narrow period &s;he had ob&s;erved much
that was admirable in his ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;i|tion,
and though the&s;e ob&s;ervations had been
&s;anctioned by the opinion of her father, they
were not &s;ufficient te&s;timonies of his general
worth to determine her upon a &s;ubject &s;o in|finitely
important to her future happine&s;s
as that, which now &s;olicited her attention.
Yet, though the thought of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Va|lancourt
was &s;o very painful to her, that
&s;he could &s;carcely endure to pau&s;e upon it,
<PB N="285" REF="297">
the con&s;iou&s;ne&s;s of this made her fear the
partiality of her judgment, and he&s;itate &s;till
more to encourage that &s;uit, for which her
own heart too tenderly pleaded. The fa|mily
of Valancourt, if not his circum&s;tances,
had been known to her father, and known to
be unexceptionable. Of his circum&s;tances,
Valancourt him&s;elf hinted as far as de|licacy
would permit, when he &s;aid he had at
pre&s;ent little el&s;e to offer but an heart, that
adored her. He had &s;olicited only for a
di&s;tant hope, and &s;he could not re&s;olve to
forbid, though &s;he &s;carcely dared to permit
it; at length, &s;he acquired courage to &s;ay,
that &s;he mu&s;t think her&s;elf honoured by the
good opinion of any per&s;on, whom her father
had e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>"And was I, then, thought worthy of
his e&s;teem?" &s;aid Valancourt, in a voice
trembling with anxiety; then checking him|&s;elf,
he added, "But pardon the que&s;tion; I
&s;carcely know what I &s;ay. If I might dare to
hope, that you think me not unworthy &s;uch
honour, and might be permitted &s;ometimes
<PB N="286" REF="298">
to enquire after your health, I &s;hould now
leave you with comparative tranquillity."</P>
<P>Emily, after a moment's &s;ilence, &s;aid, "I
will be ingenuous with you, for I know you
will under&s;tand, and allow for my &s;ituation;
you will con&s;ider it as a proof of my&mdash;my
e&s;teem that I am &s;o. Though I live here
in what was my father's hou&s;e, I live here
alone. I have, alas! no longer a parent&mdash;a
parent, who&s;e pre&s;ence might &s;anction
your vi&s;its. It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to
point out the impropriety of my receiving
them."</P>
<P>"Nor will I affect to be in&s;en&s;ible of
this," replied Valancourt, adding mourn|fully&mdash;"but
what is to con&s;ole me for my
candour? I di&s;tre&s;s you, and would now
leave the &s;ubject, if I might carry with me
a hope of being &s;ome time permitted to re|new
it, of being allowed to make my&s;elf
known to your family."</P>
<P>Emily was again confu&s;ed, and again he|&s;itated
what to reply; &s;he felt mo&s;t acutely
the difficulty&mdash;the forlornne&s;s of her &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="287" REF="299">
which did not allow her a &s;ingle rela|tive,
or friend, to whom me could turn for
even a look, that might &s;upport and guide
her in the pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ing circum|&s;tances.
Madame Cheron, who was her only
relative, and ought to have been this friend,
was either occupied by her / own amu&s;ements,
or &s;o re&s;entful of the reluctance her niece
had &s;hewn to quit La Vall&eacute;e, that &s;he &s;eemed
totally to have abandoned her.</P>
<P>"Ah! I &s;ee," &s;aid Valancourt, after a
long pau&s;e, during which Emily had begun,
and left unfini&s;hed two three &s;entences, "I
&s;ee that I have nothing to hope; my fears
were too ju&s;t, you think me unworthy of
your e&s;teem. That fatal journey! which I
con&s;idered as the happie&s;t period of my life&mdash;tho&s;e
delightful days were to embitter all
my future ones. How often I have looked
back to them with hope and fear&mdash;yet never
till this moment could I prevail with my&s;elf
to regret their enchanting influence."</P>
<P>His voice faltered, and he abruptly quit|ted
his &s;eat and walked on the terrace.
<PB N="288" REF="300">
There was an expre&s;&s;ion of de&s;pair on his
countenance, that affected Emily. The
pleadings of her heart overcame, in &s;ome
degree, her extreme timidity, and, when he
re&s;umed his &s;eat, &s;he &s;aid, in an accent that
betrayed her tenderne&s;s, "You do both
your&s;elf and me inju&s;tice when you &s;ay I
think you unworthy of my e&s;teem; I will
acknowledge that you have long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
it, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</P>
<P>Valancourt waited impatiently for the
conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, but the words
died on her lips. Her eyes, however, re|flected
all the emotions of her heart. Va|lancourt
pa&s;&s;ed, in an in&s;tant, from the im|patience
of de&s;pair, to that of joy and tender|ne&s;s.
"O Emily!" he exclaimed, "my own
Emily&mdash;teach me to &s;u&s;tain this moment!
Let me &s;eal it as the mo&s;t &s;acred of my life!"</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips, it was
cold and trembling; and, rai&s;ing his eyes,
he &s;aw the palene&s;s of her countenance.
Tears came to her relief, and Valancourt
watched in anxious &s;ilence over her. In a
<PB N="289" REF="301">
few moments, &s;he recovered her&s;elf, and
&s;miling faintly through her tears, &s;aid,
"Can you excu&s;e this weakne&s;s? My &s;pi|rits
have not yet, I believe, recovered from
the &s;hock they lately received."</P>
<P>"I cannot excu&s;e my&s;elf," &s;aid Valan|court,
"but I will forbear to renew the
&s;ubject;, which may have contributed to agi|tate
them, now that I can leave you, with
the &s;weet certainty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing your e&s;|teem.</P>
<P>Then, forgetting his re&s;olution, he again
&s;poke of him&s;elf. "You know not," &s;aid
he, "the many anxious hours I have pa&s;&s;ed
near you lately, when you believed me, if
indeed you honoured me with a thought, far
away. I have wandered, near the chateau, in
the &s;till hours of the night, when no eye could
ob&s;erve me. It was delightful to know I was
&s;o near you, and there was &s;omething particu|larly
&s;oothing in the thought, that I watched
round your habitation, while you &s;lept.
The&s;e grounds are not entirely new to me.
Once I ventured within the &s;ence, and &s;pent
<PB N="290" REF="302">
one of the happie&s;t, and yet mo&s;t melancholy
hours of my life in walking under what I be|lieved
to be your window."</P>
<P>Emily enquired how, long Valancourt had
been in the neighbourhood. "Several days,"
he replied. "It was my de&s;ign to avail
my&s;elf of the permi&s;&s;ion M. St. Aubert had
given me. I &s;carcely know how to account
for it; but, though I anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed to do
this, my re&s;olution always failed, when the
moment approached, and I con&s;tantly de|ferred
my vi&s;it. I lodged in a village at
&s;ome di&s;tance, and wandered with my dogs,
among the &s;cenes of this charming country,
wi&s;hing continually to meet you, yet not
daring to vi&s;it you."</P>
<P>Having thus continued to conver&s;e, with|out
perceiving the flight of time, Valan|court,
at length, &s;eemed to recollect him&s;elf.
"I mu&s;t go," &s;aid he mourn&s;ully, "but it
is with the hope of &s;eeing you again, of being
permitted to pay my respects to your family,
let me hear this hope confirmed by your
voice." "My family will be happy to &s;ee
<PB N="291" REF="303">
any friend of my dear father," &s;aid Emily.
Valancourt ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and &s;till lin|gered,
unable to depart, while Emily &s;at
&s;ilently with her eyes bent on the ground;
and Valancourt, as he gazed on her, con&s;i|dered
that it would &s;oon be impo&s;&s;ible for
him to recall, even to his memory, the exact
re&s;emblance of the beautiful countenance he
then beheld; at this moment an ha&s;ty foot|&s;tep
approached from behind the plane-tree,
and, turning her eyes, Emily &s;aw Madame
Cheron. She felt a blu&s;h &s;teal upon her
cheek, and her frame trembled with the
emotion of her mind; but &s;he in&s;tantly ro&s;e
to meet her vi&s;itor. "So niece," &s;aid Ma|dame
Cheron, ca&s;ting a look of &s;urpri&s;e and
enquiry on Valancourt, "&s;o niece, how do
you do? But I need not a&s;k, your looks tell
me you have already recovered your lo&s;s."</P>
<P>"My looks do me inju&s;tice then, Ma|dam,
my lo&s;s I know can never be reco|vered."</P>
<P>"Well!&mdash;I will not argue with
you; I &s;ee you have exactly your father's
<PB N="292" REF="304">
di&s;po&s;ition; and let me tell you it would
have been much happier for him, poor
man! if it had been a different one."</P>
<P>A look of dignified di&s;plea&s;ure, with
which Emily regarded Madame Cheron,
while &s;he &s;poke, would have touched almo&s;t
any other heart: &s;he made no other reply, but
introduced Valancourt, who could &s;carcely
&s;tifle the re&s;entment he &s;elt, and who&s;e bow
Madame Cheron returned with a &s;light
curte&s;y, and a look of &s;upercilious exami|nation.
After a few moments he took leave
of Emily, in a manner, that ha&s;tily expre&s;&s;ed
his pain both at his own departure, and at
leaving her to the &s;ociety of Madame Che|ron.</P>
<P>"Who is that young man?" &s;aid her
aunt, in an accent, which equally implied
inqui&s;itivene&s;s and cen&s;ure. "Some idle
admirer of yours I &s;uppo&s;e; but I believed
niece you had a greater &s;en&s;e of propriety,
than to have received the vi&s;its of any young
man in your pre&s;ent unfriended &s;ituation.
Let me tell you the world will ob&s;erve tho&s;e
<PB N="293" REF="305">
things, and it will talk, aye and very freely
too."</P>
<P>Emily, extremely &s;hocked at this coar&s;e
&s;peech, attempted to interrupt it; but Ma|dame
Cheron would proceed, with all the
&s;elf-importance of a per&s;on, to whom power
is new.</P>
<P>"It is very nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be under
the eye of &s;ome per&s;on more able to guide
you than your&s;elf. I, indeed, have not much
lei&s;ure for &s;uch a ta&s;k; however, &s;ince your
poor father made it his la&s;t reque&s;t, that I
&s;hould overlook your conduct&mdash;I mu&s;t even
take you "under my care. But this let me
tell you niece, that, unle&s;s you will deter|mine
to be very conformable to my direc|tion,
I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf longer about
you."</P>
<P>Emily made no attempt to interrupt Ma|dame
Cheron a &s;econd time, grief and the
pride of con&s;cious innocence kept her &s;ilent,
till her aunt &s;aid, "I am now come to
take you with me to Thoulou&s;e; I am &s;orry
to find, that your poor father died, after all,
<PB N="294" REF="306">
in &s;uch indifferent circum&s;tances; however,
I &s;hall take you home with me. Ah! poor
man, he was always more generous than pro|vident,
or he would not have left his daugh|ter
dependent on his relations."</P>
<P>"Nor has he done &s;o, I hope, madam,"
&s;aid Emily calmly, "nor did his pecuniary
misfortunes ari&s;e from that noble genero&s;ity,
which always di&s;tingui&s;hed him. The affairs
of M. de Motteville may, I tru&s;t, yet
be &s;ettled without deeply injuring his credi|tors,
and in the mean time I &s;hould be very
happy to remain at La Vall&eacute;e."</P>
<P>"No doubt you would," replied Ma|dame
Cheron, with a &s;mile of irony, "and
I &s;hall no doubt con&s;ent to this, &s;ince I &s;ee
how nece&s;&s;ary tranquillity and retirement
are to re&s;tore your &s;pirits. I did not think
you capable of &s;o much duplicity, niece;
when you pleaded this excu&s;e for re|maining
here, I fooli&s;hly believed it to be
a ju&s;t one, nor expected to have found with
you &s;o agreeable a companion as this M.
La Val&mdash;, I forget his name."</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="307">
Emily could no longer endure the&s;e cruel
indignities. "It was a ju&s;t one, madam,"
&s;aid &s;he; "and now, indeed, I feel more than
ever the value of the retirement I then &s;o|licited;
and, if the purport of your vi&s;it is
only to add in&s;ult to the &s;orrows of your
brother's child, &s;he could well have &s;pared
it."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee that I have undertaken a very
trouble&s;ome ta&s;k," &s;aid Madame Cheron,
colouring highly. "I am &s;ure, madam,"
&s;aid Emily mildly, and endeavouring to re|&s;train
her tears, "I am &s;ure my father did
not mean it &s;hould be &s;uch. I have the
happine&s;s to reflect, that my conduct under
his eye was &s;uch as he often delighted to ap|prove.
It would be very painful to me to
di&s;obey the &s;i&s;ter of &s;uch a parent, and, if
you believe the ta&s;k will really be &s;o trouble|&s;ome,
I mu&s;t lament, that it is yours."</P>
<P>"Well! niece, fine &s;peaking &s;ignifies little.
I am willing, in con&s;ideration of my poor
brother, to overlook the impropriety of your
<PB N="296" REF="308">
late conduct, and to try what your future
will be."</P>
<P>Emily interrupted her, to beg &s;he would
explain what was the impropriety &s;he al|luded
to.</P>
<P>"What impropriety! why that of re|ceiving
the vi&s;its of a lover unknown to
your family," replied Madame Cheron, not
con&s;idering the impropriety of which &s;he
had her&s;elf been guilty, in expo&s;ing her niece
to the po&s;&s;ibility of conduct &s;o erroneous.</P>
<P>A faint blu&s;h pa&s;&s;ed over Emily's counte|nance;
pride and anxiety &s;truggled in her
brea&s;t; and, till &s;he recollected, that appear|ances
did, in &s;ome degree, ju&s;tify her aunt's
&s;u&s;picions, &s;he could not re&s;olve to humble
her&s;elf &s;o far as to enter into the defence
of a conduct, which had been &s;o innocent
and unde&s;igning on her part. She men|tioned
the manner of Valancourt's introduc|tion
to her father; the circum&s;tance of his
receiving the pi&s;tol-&s;hot, and of their after|wards
travelling together; with the acci|dental
way, in which &s;he had met him, on
<PB N="297" REF="309">
the preceding evening. She owned he had
declared a partiality for her, and that he
had a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to addre&s;s her family.</P>
<P>"And who is this young adventurer,
pray?" &s;aid Madame Cheron, "and what
are his preten&s;ions?" "The&s;e he mu&s;t
him&s;elf explain, madam," replied Emily.
"Of his family my father was not igno|rant,
and I believe it is unexceptionable."
She then proceeded to mention what &s;he
knew concerning it.</P>
<P>"O, then, this it &s;eems is a younger bro|ther,"
exclaimed her aunt, "and of cour&s;e
a beggar. A very &s;ine tale indeed! And
&s;o my brother took a fancy to this young
man after only a few days acquaintance!&mdash;but
that was &s;o like him! In his youth
he was always taking the&s;e likes and di&s;|likes,
when no other per&s;on &s;aw any rea&s;on
for them at all; nay, indeed, I have often
thought the people he di&s;approved were
much more agreeable than tho&s;e he ad|mired;&mdash;but
there is no accounting for
ta&s;tes. He was always &s;o much influenced
<PB N="298" REF="310">
by people's countenances; now I, for my
part, have no notion of this, it is all ridicu|lous
enthu&s;ia&s;m. What has a man's face to
do with his character? Can a man of good
character help having a di&s;agreeable face?"&mdash;which
la&s;t &s;entence Madame Cheron de|livered
with the deci&s;ive air of a per&s;on who
congratulates her&s;elf on having made a
grand di&s;covery, and believes the que&s;tion
to be unan&s;werably &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Emily, de&s;irous of concluding the con|ver&s;ation,
enquired if her aunt would accept
&s;ome re&s;re&s;hment, and Madame Cheron ac|companied
her to the chateau, but without
de&s;i&s;ting from a topic, which &s;he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed
with &s;o much complacency to" her&s;elf, and
&s;everity to her niece.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry to perceive, niece," &s;aid &s;he,
in allu&s;ion to &s;omewhat that Emily had &s;aid,
concerning phy&s;iognomy, "that you have
a great many of your father's prejudices,
and among them are tho&s;e &s;udden predilec|tions
for people from their looks. I can
perceive, that you imagine your&s;elf to be
<PB N="299" REF="311">
violently in love with this young adventurer,
after an acquaintance of only a few days.
There was &s;omething, too, &s;o charmingly
romantic in the manner of your meeting!"</P>
<P>Emily checked the tears, that trembled in
her eyes, while &s;he &s;aid, "When my con|duct
mall de&s;erve this &s;everity, madam, you
will do well to exerci&s;e it; till then ju&s;tice,
if not tenderne&s;s, &s;hould &s;urely re&s;train it. I
have never willingly offended you; now I
have loft my parents, you are the only per&s;on
to whom I can look, for kindne&s;s. Let me
not lament more than ever the lo&s;s of &s;uch
parents." The la&s;t words were almo&s;t &s;tifled
by her emotions, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears.
Remembering the delicacy and the tender|ne&s;s
of St. Aubert, the happy, happy days
&s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e &s;cenes, and contra&s;t|ing
them with the coar&s;e and unfeeling be|haviour
of Madame Cheron, and with the
future hours of mortification &s;he mu&s;t &s;ub|mit
to in her pre&s;ence&mdash;a degree of grief
&s;eized her, that almo&s;t reached de&s;pair. Ma|dame
Cheron, more offended by the reproof,
<PB N="300" REF="312">
which Emily's words conveyed, than touch|ed
by the &s;orrow they expre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid nothing,
that might &s;often her grief; but, notwith|&s;tanding
an apparent reluctance to receive
her niece, &s;he de&s;ired her company. The
love of &s;way was her ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he
knew it would be highly gratified by taking
into her hou&s;e a young orphan, who had no
appeal from her deci&s;ions, and on whom &s;he
could exerci&s;e without controul the caprici|ous
humour of the moment.</P>
<P>On entering the chateau, Madame Cheron
expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, that &s;he would put up
what &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to take to Tho|lou&s;e,
as &s;he meant to &s;et off immediately.
Emily now tried to per&s;uade her to defer
the journey, at lea&s;t, till the next day, and,
at length, with much difficulty, prevailed.</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed in the exerci&s;e of petty
tyranny on the part of Madame Cheron,
and in mournful regret and melancholy an|ticipation
on that of Emily, who, when
her aunt retired to her apartment for the
night, went, to take leave of every other
<PB N="301" REF="313">
room in this her dear native home, which
&s;he was now quitting for &s;he knew not how
long, and for a world, to which &s;he was
wholly a &s;tranger. She could not conquer
a pre&s;entiment, which frequently occurred
to her, this night&mdash;that &s;he &s;hould never
more return to La Vall&eacute;e. Having pa&s;&s;ed
a considerable time in what had been her fa|ther's
&s;tudy, having &s;elected &s;ome of his fa|vourite
authors, to put up with her clothes,
and &s;hed many tears, as &s;he wiped the du&s;t
from their covers, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf in his
chair before the reading de&s;k, and &s;at lo&s;t
in melancholy reflection, till There&s;a opened
the door to examine, as was her cu&s;tom be|fore
&s;he went to bed, if all was &s;afe. She
&s;tarted, on ob&s;erving her young lady, who
bade her come in, and then gave her &s;ome
directions for keeping the chateau in readi|ne&s;s
for her reception at all times.</P>
<P>"Alas-a day! that you &s;hould leave it!"
&s;aid There&s;a, "I think you would be hap|pier
here than where you are going, if one
may judge." Emily made no reply to this
<PB N="302" REF="314">
remark; he &s;orrow There&s;a proceeded to
expre&s;s at her departure a&s;&s;ected her, but
&s;he &s;ound &s;ome comfort in the &s;imple affect|tion
of this poor old &s;ervant, to whom &s;he
gave &s;uch directions as might be&s;t conduce
to her comfort, during her own ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed There&s;a to bed, Emily
wandered through every lonely apartment of
the chateau, lingering long in what had been
her father's bed-room, indulging melan|choly,
yet not unplea&s;ing, emotions, and,
having often returned, within the door to
take another look at it, &s;he withdrew to her
own chamber. From her window &s;he gazed
upon the garden below, &s;hewn faintly by the
moon, ri&s;ing over the tops of the palm-trees,
and, at length, the calm, beauty, of the night
increa&s;ed a de&s;ire of indulging the mournful
&s;weetness of bidding farewel to the beloved
&s;hades of her childhood, till &s;he was tempted
to de&s;cend. Throwing over her the light
veil, in which &s;he u&s;ually walked, &s;he &s;ilently
pa&s;&s;ed into the garden, and, ha&s;tening to|wards
the di&s;tant groves, was glad to breathe
<PB N="303" REF="315">
once more the air of liberty, and to &s;igh un|ob&s;erved.
The deep repo&s;e of the &s;cene,
the rich &s;cents, that floated on the breeze,
the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the
clear blue arch, &s;oothed and gradually ele|vated
her mind to that &s;ublime compla|cency,
which renders the vexations of this
world &s;o in&s;ignificant and mean in our eyes,
that we wonder they have had power for a
moment to di&s;turb us. Emily forgot Ma|dame
Cheron and all the circum&s;tances of
her conduct, while her thoughts a&s;cended
to the contemplation, of tho&s;e unnumbered
worlds, that lie &s;cattered in the depths of
aether, thau&s;ands of them hid from human
eyes, and almo&s;t beyond the &s;light of human
fancy. As her imagination &s;oared through
the regions of &s;pace, and a&s;pired to that
Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, which pervades and go|verns
all being, the idea of her father &s;carcely
ever le&s;t her; but it was a plea&s;ing idea,
&s;ince &s;he re&s;igned him to God in the full
confidence of a pure and holy faith. She
pur&s;ued her way through the groves to the
<PB N="304" REF="316">
terrace, often pau&s;ing as memory awakened
the pang of affection, and as rea&s;on antici|pated
the exile, into which &s;he was going.</P>
<P>And now the moon was high over the
woods, touching their &s;ummits with yellow
light, and darting between the foliage long
level beams; while on the rapid Garonne
below the trembling radiance was faintly
ob&s;cured by the lighte&s;t vapour. Emily
long watched the playing lu&s;tre, li&s;tened to
the &s;oothing murmur of the current, and
the yet lighter &s;ounds of the air, as it &s;tirred,
at intervals, the lofty palm-trees. "How
delightful is the &s;weet breath of the&s;e
groves," &s;aid &s;he. "This lovely &s;cene!&mdash;how
often &s;hall I remember and regret it,
when I am far away. Alas! What events
may occur before I &s;ee it again! O, peace|ful,
happy &s;hades!&mdash;&s;cenes of my infant
delights, of parental tenderne&s;s now lo&s;t for
ever!&mdash;why must I leave ye!&mdash;In your re|treats
I &s;hould &s;till &s;ind &s;afety and repo&s;e.
Sweet hours of my childhood&mdash;I am now
to leave even your la&s;t memorials! No ob|jects,
<PB N="305" REF="317">
that would revive your impre&s;&s;ions,
will remain for me!"</P>
<P>Then drying her tears and looking up,
her thoughts ro&s;e again to the &s;ublime &s;ub|ject
&s;he had contemplated, the &s;ame divine
complacency &s;tole over her heart, and, hu&s;h|ing
its throbs, in&s;pired hope and confidence
and re&s;ignation to the will of the Deity,
who&s;e works filled her mind with adora|tion.</P>
<P>Emily gazed long on the plane-tree, and
then &s;eated her&s;elf, for the la&s;t time, on the
bench under its &s;hade, where &s;he had &s;o
often &s;at with her parents, and where, only
a few hours before, &s;he had conver&s;ed with
Valancourt, at the remembrance of whom,
thus revived, a mingled &s;en&s;ation of e&s;teem,
tenderne&s;s and anxiety ro&s;e in her brea&s;t.
With this remembrance occurred a recol|lection
of his late confession&mdash;that he had
often wandered near her habitation in the
night, having even pa&s;&s;ed the boundary of
the garden, and it immediately occurred to
her, that he might be at this moment in the
<PB N="306" REF="318">
grounds. The fear of meeting him, parti|cularly
after the declaration he had made,
and of incurring a cen&s;ure, which her aunt
might &s;o rea&s;onably be&s;tow, if it was known,
that &s;he was met by her lover, at this hour,
made her in&s;tantly leave her beloved plane|tree,
and walk towards the chateau. She
ca&s;t an anxious eye around, and often &s;top|ped
for a moment to examine the &s;hadowy
&s;cene before &s;he ventured to proceed, but
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed on without perceiving any per|&s;on,
till, having reached a clump of almond
trees, not far from the hou&s;e, &s;he re&s;ted
to take a retro&s;pect of the garden, and to|&s;igh
forth another adieu: As her eyes wan|dered
over the land&s;cape &s;he thought &s;he
perceived a per&s;on emerge from the groves,
and pa&s;s &s;lowly along a moon-light alley
that led between them, but the di&s;tance,
and the imperfect light would not &s;uffer her
to judge with any degree of certainty whe|ther
this was fancy or reality. She con|tinued
to gaze for &s;ome time on the &s;pot,
till an the dead &s;tillne&s;s of the air &s;he heard
<PB N="307" REF="319">
a &s;udden &s;ound, and in the next in&s;tant
fancied &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed foot&s;teps near her.
Wa&s;ting not another moment in conjecture,
&s;he hurried to the chateau, and, having
reached it, retired to her chamber, where, as
&s;he clo&s;ed her window &s;he looked upon the
garden, and then again thought &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
a figure, gliding between the almond
trees &s;he had ju&s;t left. She immediately
withdrew from the ca&s;ement, and, though
much agitated, &s;ought in &s;leep the refre&s;h|ment
of a &s;hort oblivion.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT an early hour, the carriage, which
was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to
Tholou&s;e, appeared at the door of the cha|teau,
and Madame was already in the break|fast-room,
when her niece entered it. The
repa&s;t was &s;ilent and melancholy on the
part of Emily; and Madame Cheron,
who&s;e vanity was piqued on ob&s;erving her
dejection, reproved her in a manner that
did not contribute to remove it. It was
with much reluctance, that Emily's reque&s;t
to take with her the dog, which had been a
<PB N="309" REF="321">
favourite of her father, was granted. Her
aunt, impatient to be gone, ordered the car|riage
to draw up; and, while &s;he pa&s;&s;ed to
the hall door, Emily gave another look
into the library, and another farewell glance
over the garden, and then followed. Old
There&s;a &s;tood at the door to take leave of
her young lady. "God for ever keep you,
ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid &s;he, while Emily gave
her hand in &s;ilence, and could an&s;wer only
with a pre&s;&s;ure of her hand, and a forced
&s;mile.</P>
<P>At the gate, which led out of the grounds,
&s;everal of her father's pen&s;ioners were a&s;|&s;embled
to bid her farewell, to whom &s;he
would have &s;poken, if her aunt would have
&s;uffered the driver to &s;top; and, having
di&s;tributed to them almo&s;t all the money &s;he
had about her, &s;he &s;unk back in the car|riage,
yielding to the melancholy of her
heart. Soon after, &s;he caught, between
the &s;teep-banks of the road, another view
of the chateau, peeping from among the
high trees, and &s;urrounded by green &s;lopes
<PB N="310" REF="322">
and tufted groves, the Garonne winding its
way beneath their &s;hades, &s;ometimes lo&s;t
among the vineyards, and then ri&s;ing in
greater maje&s;ty in the di&s;tant pa&s;tures. The
towering precipices of the Pyren&eacute;es, that ro&s;e
to the &s;outh, gave Emily a thou&s;and intere&s;t|ing
recollections of her late journey; and
the&s;e objects of her former enthu&s;ia&s;tic admi|ration,
now excited only &s;orrow and regret.
Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely
&s;cenery, till the banks again clo&s;ed upon
them, her mind became too much occupied
by mournful reflections, to permit her to at|tend
to the conver&s;ation, which Madame
Cheron had begun on &s;ome trivial topic,
&s;o that they &s;oon travelled in profound &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>Valancourt, mean while, was returned to
E&s;tuviere, his heart occupied with the image
of Emily; &s;ometimes indulging in reveries
of future happine&s;s, but more frequently
&s;hrinking with dread of the oppo&s;ition he
might encounter from her family. He was
the younger &s;on of an ancient family of
<PB N="311" REF="323">
Ga&s;cony; and, having lo&s;t his parents at an
early period of his life, the care of his edu|cation
and of his &s;mall portion had devolved,
to his brother, the Count de Duvarney, his
&s;enior by nearly twenty years. Valancourt
had been educated in all the accompli&s;h|ments
of his age, and had an ardour of &s;pi|rit,
and a certain grandeur of mind, that
gave him particular excellence in the exer|ci&s;es
then thought heroic. His little for|tune
had been dimini&s;hed by the nece&s;&s;ary
expences of his education; but M. La Va|lancourt,
the elder, &s;eemed to think, that
his genius and accompli&s;hments would am|ply
&s;upply the deficiency of his inheritance.
They offered flattering hopes of promotion
in the military profe&s;&s;ion, in tho&s;e times al|mo&s;t
the only one in which a gentleman
could engage without incurring a &s;tain on
his name; and La Valancourt was of cour&s;e
enrolled in the army. The general genius
of his mind was but little under&s;tood by
his brother. That ardour for whatever is
great and good in the moral world, as well as
<PB N="312" REF="324">
in the natural one, di&s;played it&s;elf in his
infant years; and the &s;trong indignation,
which he felt and expre&s;&s;ed at a criminal,
or a mean action, &s;ometimes drew upon him
the di&s;plea&s;ure of his tutor; who reprobated
it under the general term of violence of
temper; and who, when haranguing on the
virtues of mildne&s;s and moderation, &s;eemed
to forget the gentlene&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion,
which always appeared in his pupil towards
objects of misfortune.</P>
<P>He had now obtained leave of ab&s;ence
from his regiment when he made the excur|&s;ion
into the Pyren&eacute;es, which was the means
of introducing him to St. Aubert; and, as
this permi&s;&s;ion was nearly expired, he was
the more anxious to declare him&s;elf to
Emily's family, from whom he rea&s;onably
apprehended oppo&s;ition, &s;ince his fortune,
though, with a moderate addition from hers,
it would be &s;ufficient to &s;upport them,
would not &s;atisfy the views, either of vanity,
or ambition. Valancourt was not without
the latter, but he &s;aw golden vi&s;ions of pro|motion
<PB N="313" REF="325">
in the army; and believed, that with
Emily he could, in the mean time, be de|lighted
to live within the limits of his hum|ble
income. His thoughts were now oc|cupied
in con&s;idering the means of making
him&s;elf known to her family, to whom,
however, he had yet no addre&s;s, for he was
entirely ignorant of Emily's precipitate de|parture
from La Vall&eacute;e, of whom he hoped
to obtain it.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the travelers pur&s;ued their
journey; Emily making frequent efforts to
appear chearful, and too often relap&s;ing
into &s;ilence and dejection. Madame Che|ron,
attributing her melancholy &s;olely to the
circum&s;tance of her being removed to a
di&s;tance from her lover, and believing, that
the &s;orrow, which her niece &s;till expre&s;&s;ed
for the lo&s;s of St. Aubert, proceeded partly
from an affectation of &s;en&s;ibility, endea|voured
to make it appear ridiculous to her,
that &s;uch deep regret mould continue to be
felt &s;o long after the period u&s;ually allowed
for grief.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="326">
At length, the&s;e unplea&s;ant lectures were
interrupted by the arrival of the travellers
at Tholou&s;e; and Emily, who had not
been there for many years, and had only a,
very faint recollection of it, was &s;urpri&s;ed
at the o&s;tentatious &s;tyle exhibited in her
aunt's hou&s;e and furniture; the more &s;o,
perhaps, becau&s;e it was &s;o totally different
from the mode&s;t elegance, to which &s;he had
been accu&s;tomed. She followed Madame
Cheron through a large hall, where &s;everal
&s;ervants in rich liveries appeared, to a kind
of &s;aloon, fitted up with more &s;hew than
ta&s;te; and her aunt, complaining of fa|tigue,
ordered &s;upper immediately. "I
am glad to find my&s;elf in my own hou&s;e
again," &s;aid &s;he, throwing her&s;elf on a large
&s;ettee, "and to have my own people about
me. I dete&s;t travelling; though, indeed, I
ought to like it, for what I &s;ee abroad al|ways
makes me delighted to return to my
own chateau. What makes you &s;o &s;ilent,
child?&mdash;What is it that difturbs you now?"</P>
<P>Emily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;tarting tear, and
<PB N="315" REF="327">
tried to &s;mile away the expre&s;&s;ion of an op|pre&s;&s;ed
heart; &s;he was thinking of <HI>her</HI>
home, and felt too &s;en&s;ibly the arrogance
and o&s;tentatious vanity of Madame Che|ron's
conver&s;ation. "Can this be my fa|ther's
&s;i&s;ter!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; and then
the conviction that &s;he was &s;o, warming her
heart with &s;omething like kindne&s;s towards
her, &s;he felt anxious to &s;often the har&s;h im|pre&s;&s;ion
her mind had received of her aunt's
character, and to &s;hew a willingne&s;s to
oblige her. The effort did not entirely
fail; &s;he li&s;tened with apparent chearfulne&s;s,
while Madame Cheron expatiated on the
&s;plendour of her hou&s;e, told of the nume|rous
parties &s;he entertained, and what &s;he
&s;hould expect of Emily, who&s;e diffidence a&s;|&s;umed
the air of a re&s;erve, which her aunt, be|lieving
it to be that of pride and ignorance
united, now took occa&s;ion to reprehend.
She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind,
that fears to tru&s;t its own powers; which,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a nice judgment, and inclining to
believe, that every other per&s;on perceives
<PB N="316" REF="328">
&s;till more critically, fears to commit it&s;elf to
cen&s;ure, and &s;eeks &s;helter in the ob&s;curity
of &s;ilence. Emily had frequently blu&s;hed
at the fearle&s;s manners, which &s;he had &s;een
admired, and the brilliant nothings, which
&s;he had heard applauded; yet this applau&s;e,
&s;o far from encouraging her to imitate the
conduct that had won it, rather made her
&s;hrink into the re&s;erve, that would protect
her from &s;uch ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron looked on her niece's
diffidence with a feeling very near to con|tempt,
and endeavoured to overcome it by
reproof, rather than to encourage it by gen|tlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The entrance of &s;upper &s;omewhat inter|rupted
the complacent di&s;cour&s;e of Ma|dame
Cheron and the painful con&s;iderations,
which it had forced upon Emily. When
the repa&s;t, which was rendered o&s;tentatious
by the attendance of a great number of &s;er|vants,
and by a profu&s;ion of plate, was over,
Madame Cheron retired to her chamber,
and a female &s;ervant came to &s;hew Emily
<PB N="317" REF="329">
to hers. Having pa&s;&s;ed up a large &s;tair
ca&s;e, and through &s;everal galleries, they
came to a flight of back &s;tairs, which led
into a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age in a remote part of the
chateau, and there the &s;ervant opened the
door of a &s;mall chamber, which &s;he &s;aid
was Ma'am&s;elle Emily's, who, once more
alone, indulged the tears &s;he had long
tried to re&s;train.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who know, from experience, how
much the heart becomes attached even to
inanimate objects, to which it has been
long accu&s;tomed, how unwillingly it re|&s;igns
them; how with the &s;en&s;ations of an
old friend it meets them, after temporary
ab&s;ence, will under&s;tand the forlornne&s;s of
Emily's feelings, of Emily &s;hut out from
the only home &s;he had known from her in|fancy,
and thrown upon a &s;cene, and among
per&s;ons, di&s;agreeable for more qualities
than their novelty. Her father's favourite
dog, now in the chamber, thus &s;eemed to
acquire the character and importance of a
friend; and, as the animal fawned over her
<PB N="318" REF="330">
when &s;he wept, and licked her hands,
"Ah, poor Manchon!" &s;aid &s;he, "I have
nobody now to love me&mdash;but you!" and
&s;he wept the more. After &s;ome time, her
thoughts returning to her father's injunc|tions,
&s;he remembered how often he had
blamed her for indulging u&s;ele&s;s &s;orrow;
how often he had pointed out to her the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of fortitude and patience, a&s;&s;uring
her, that the faculties of the mind &s;trengthen
by exertion, till they finally unnerve afflic|tion,
and triumph over it. The&s;e recollec|tions
dried her tears, gradually &s;oothed her
&s;pirits, and in&s;pired her with the &s;weet emu|lation
of practi&s;ing precepts, which her fa|ther
had &s;o frequently inculcated.</P>

<P>MADAME Cheron's hou&s;e &s;tood at a
little di&s;tance from the city of Tholou&s;e,
and was &s;urrounded by exten&s;ive gardens,
in which Emily, who had ari&s;en early,
amu&s;ed her&s;elf with wandering before
breakfa&s;t, From a terrace, that extended
along the highe&s;t part of them, was a wide
view over Languedoc. On the di&s;taht ho|rizon
to the &s;outh, &s;he di&s;covered the wild
&s;ummits of the Pyren&eacute;es, and her fancy im|mediately
painted the green pa&s;tures of
Ga&s;cony at their feet. Her heart pointed
to her peaceful home&mdash;to the neighbour|hood
where Valancourt was&mdash;where St.
<PB N="320" REF="332">
Aubert had been; and her imagination,
piercing the veil of di&s;tance, brought that
home to her eyes in all its intere&s;ting and
romantic beauty. She experienced an in|expre&s;&s;ible
plea&s;ure in believing, that &s;he
beheld the country around it, though no
feature could be di&s;tingui&s;hed, except the
retiring chain of the Pyren&eacute;es; and, inat|tentive
to the &s;cene immediately before
her, and to the flight of time, &s;he continued
to lean on the window of a pavilion, that
terminated the terrace, with her eyes fixed
on Ga&s;cony, and her mind occupied with
the intere&s;ting ideas which the view of it
awakened, till a &s;ervant came to tell her
breakfa&s;t was ready. Her thoughts thus
recalled to the &s;urrounding objects, the
&s;traight walks, &s;quare parterres, and artifi|cial
fountains of the garden, could not fail,
as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through it, to appear the
wor&s;e, oppo&s;ed to the negligent graces, and
natural beauties of the grounds at La Val|l&eacute;e,
upon which her recollection had been
&s;o inten&s;ely employed.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="333">
"Whither have you been rambling &s;o
early?" &s;aid Madame Cheron, as her niece
entered the breakfa&s;t-room. "I don't ap|prove
of the&s;e &s;olitary walks," and Emily
was &s;urpri&s;ed, when, having informed her
aunt, that &s;he had been no further than the
gardens, &s;he under&s;tood the&s;e to be included
in the reproof. "I de&s;ire you will not
walk there again at &s;o early an hour unat|tended,"
&s;aid Madame Cheron; "my gar|dens
are very exten&s;ive; and a young wo|man,
who can make a&s;&s;ignations by moon|light,
at La Vall&eacute;e, is not to be tru&s;ted to
her own inclinations el&s;ewhere."</P>
<P>Emily, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked,
had &s;carcely power to beg an explanation of
the&s;e words, and, when &s;he did, her aunt
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give it, though, by her
&s;evere looks, and half &s;entences, &s;he ap|peared
anxious to impre&s;s Emily with a be|lief,
that &s;he was well informed of &s;ome de|grading
circum&s;tances of her conduct. Con|&s;cious
innocence could not prevent a blu&s;h
from &s;tealing over Emily's cheek; &s;he trem|bled,
<PB N="322" REF="334">
and looked confu&s;edly under the bold
eye of Madame Cheron, who blu&s;hed al&s;o;
but hers was the blu&s;h of triumph, &s;uch as
&s;ometimes &s;tains the countenance of a per|&s;on,
congratulating him&s;elf on the penetra|tion
which had taught him to &s;u&s;pect ano|ther,
and who lo&s;es both pity for the &s;up|po&s;ed
criminal, and indignation of his guilt,
in the gratification of his own vanity.</P>
<P>Emily, not doubting that her aunt's mi&s;|take
aro&s;e from the having ob&s;erved her
ramble in the garden on the night preced|ing
her departure from La Vall&eacute;e, now
mentioned the motive of it, at which Ma|dame
Cheron &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly, re|fu&s;ing
either to accept this explanation, or
to give her rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing it; and,
&s;oon after, &s;he concluded the &s;ubject by &s;ay|ing,
"I never tru&s;t people's a&s;&s;ertions, I
always judge of them by their actions; but
I am willing to try what will be your beha|viour
in future."</P>
<P>Emily, le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed by her aunt's mo|deration
and my&s;terious &s;ilence, than by the
<PB N="323" REF="335">
accu&s;ation &s;he had received, deeply con&s;i|dered
the latter, and &s;carcely doubted, that
it was Valancourt whom &s;he had &s;een at
night in the gardens of La Vall&eacute;e, and that
he had been ob&s;erved there by Madame
Cheron; who now pa&s;&s;ing from one painful
topic only to revive another almo&s;t equally
&s;o, &s;poke of the &s;ituation of her niece's pro|perty,
in the hands of M. Motteville. While
&s;he thus talked with oftentatious pity of
Emily's misfortunes, &s;he failed not to incul|cate
the duties of humility and gratitude, or
to render Emily fully &s;en&s;ible of every cruel
mortification, who &s;oon perceived, that &s;he
was to be con&s;idered as a dependent, not
only by her aunt, but by her aunt's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>She was now informed, that a large party
were expected to dinner, on which account
Madame Cheron repeated the le&s;&s;on of the
preceding night, concerning her conduct in
company, and Emily wi&s;hed, that &s;he might
have courage enough to practi&s;e it. Her
aunt then proceeded to examine the &s;impli|city
of her dre&s;s, adding, that &s;he expected
<PB N="324" REF="336">
to &s;ee her attired with gaiety and ta&s;te;
after which me conde&s;cended to &s;hew Emily
the &s;plendour of her chateau, and to point
out the particular beauty, or elegance,
which &s;he thought di&s;tingui&s;hed each of her
numerous &s;uites of apartments. She then
withdrew to her toilet, the throne of her
homage, and Emily to her chamber, to un|pack
her books, and to try to charm her
mind by reading, till the hour of dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>When the company arrived, Emily en|tered
the &s;aloon with an air of timidity,
which all her efforts could not overcome,
and which was increa&s;ed by the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of Madame Cheron's &s;evere ob&s;ervation.
Her mourning dre&s;s, the mild dejection of
her beautiful countenance, and the retiring
diffidence of her manner, rendered her a
very intere&s;ting object to many of the
company, among whom &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
Signor Montoni, and his friend Cavigni,
the late vi&s;itors at M. Que&s;nel's, who now
&s;eemed to conver&s;e with Madame Cheron
with the familiarity of old acquaintance,
<PB N="325" REF="337">
and &s;he to attend to them with particular
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This Signor Montoni had an air of con|&s;cious
&s;uperiority, animated by &s;pirit, and
&s;trengthened by talents, to which every per|&s;on
&s;eemed involuntarily to yield. The
quickne&s;s of his perceptions was &s;trikingly
expre&s;&s;ed on his countenance, yet that
countenance could &s;ubmit implicitly to oc|ca&s;ion;
and, more than once in this day,
the triumph of art over nature might have
been di&s;cerned in it. His vi&s;age was
long, and rather narrow, yet he was called
hand&s;ome; and it was, perhaps, the &s;pirit
and vigour of his &s;oul, &s;parkling through
his features, that triumphed for him. Emily
felt admiration, but not the admiration
that leads to e&s;teem; for it was mixed
with a degree of fear &s;he knew not exactly
wherefore.</P>
<P>Cavigni was gay and in&s;inuating as for|merly;
and, though he paid almo&s;t ince&s;|&s;ant
attention to Madame Cheron, he found
&s;ome opportunities of conver&s;ing with
<PB N="326" REF="338">
Emily, to whom he directed, at fir&s;t, the
fallies of his wit, but now and then a&s;&s;umed
an air of tenderne&s;s, which &s;he ob&s;erved,
and &s;hrunk from. Though &s;he replied but
little, the gentlene&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of her
manners encouraged him to talk, and &s;he
felt relieved when a young lady of the
party, who &s;poke ince&s;&s;antly, obtruded her|&s;elf
on his notice. This lady, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
all the &s;prightline&s;s of a French|woman,
with all her coquetry, affected to
under&s;tand every &s;ubject, or rather there
was no affectation in the ca&s;e; for, never
looking beyond the limits of her own ig|norance,
&s;he believed &s;he had nothing
to learn. She attracted notice from all;
amu&s;ed &s;ome, di&s;gu&s;ted others for a mo|ment,
and was then forgotten.</P>
<P>This day pa&s;&s;ed without any material oc|currence;
and Emily, though amu&s;ed by the
characters &s;he had &s;een, was glad when &s;he
could retire to the recollections, which had
acquired with her the character of duties.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="339">
A fortnight pa&s;&s;ed in a round of di&s;&s;ipa|tion
and company, and Emily, who at|tended
Madame Cheron in all her vi&s;its,
was &s;ometimes entertained, but oftener
wearied. She was &s;truck by the apparent
talents and knowledge di&s;played in the va|rious
conver&s;ations &s;he li&s;tened to, and it
was long before &s;he di&s;covered, that the ta|lents
were for the mo&s;t part tho&s;e of impo&s;|ture,
and the knowledge nothing more than
was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. But what de|ceived
her mo&s;t, was the air of con&s;tant
gaiety and good &s;pirits, di&s;played by every
vi&s;itor, and which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from
content as con&s;tant, and from benevolence
as ready. At length, from the over-acting
of &s;ome, le&s;s accompli&s;hed than the others,
&s;he could perceive, that, though content|ment
and benevolence are the only &s;ure
&s;ources of cheerfulne&s;s, the immoderate and
feveri&s;h animation, u&s;ually exhibited in
large parties, re&s;ults partly from an in&s;en&s;i|bility
to the cares, which benevolence mu&s;t
&s;ometimes derive from the &s;ufferings of
<PB N="328" REF="340">
others, and partly from a de&s;ire to di&s;play
the appearance of that pro&s;perity, which
they know will command &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and
attention to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Emily's plea&s;ante&s;t hours were pa&s;&s;ed in
the pavilion of the terrace, to which &s;he re|tired,
when &s;he could &s;teal from ob&s;ervation,
with a book to overcome, or a lute to in|dulge,
her melancholy. There, as &s;he &s;at
with her eyes fixed on the far-di&s;tant Pyre|n&eacute;es,
and her thoughts on Valancourt and
the beloved &s;cenes of Ga&s;cony, &s;he would
play the &s;weet and melancholy &s;ongs of her
native province&mdash;the popular &s;ongs &s;he had
li&s;tened to from her childhood.</P>
<P>One evening, having excu&s;ed her&s;elf from
accompanying her aunt abroad, &s;he thus
withdrew to the pavilion, with books and
her lute. It was the mild and beautiful
evening of a &s;ultry day, and the windows,
which fronted the we&s;t, opened upon all
the glory of a &s;etting &s;un. Its rays illumi|nated,
with &s;trong &s;plendour, the cliffs of
the Pyren&eacute;es, and touched their &s;nowy tops
<PB N="329" REF="341">
with a ro&s;eate hue, that remained, long after
the &s;un had &s;unk below the horizon, and
the &s;hades of twilight had &s;tolen over the
land&s;cape. Emily touched her lute with
that fine melancholy expre&s;&s;ion, which came
from her heart. The pen&s;ive hour and the
&s;cene, the evening light on the Garonne,
that flowed at no great di&s;tance, and who&s;e
waves, as they pa&s;&s;ed towards La Vall&eacute;e,
&s;he often viewed with a &s;igh,&mdash;the&s;e united
circum&s;tances di&s;po&s;ed her mind to tender|ne&s;s,
and her thoughts were with Valan|court;
of whom &s;he had heard nothing &s;ince
her arrival at Tholou&s;e, and now that &s;he
was removed from him, and in uncertainty,
&s;he perceived all the intere&s;t he held in her
heart. Before &s;he &s;aw Valancourt &s;he had
never met a mind and ta&s;te &s;o accordant
with her own, and, though Madame Che|ron
told her much of the arts of di&s;&s;imula|tion,
and that the elegance and propriety of
thought, which &s;he &s;o much admired in
her lover, were a&s;&s;umed for the purpo&s;e of
plea&s;ing her, &s;he could &s;carcely doubt their
<PB N="330" REF="342">
truth. This po&s;&s;ibility, however, faint as it
was, was &s;ufficient to hara&s;s her mind with
anxiety, and &s;he found, that few conditions
are more painful than that of uncertainty,
as to the merit of a beloved object; an
uncertainty, which &s;he would not have &s;uf|fered,
had her confidence in her own opi|nions
been greater.</P>
<P>She was awakened from her mu&s;ing by
the &s;ound of hor&s;es' feet along a road, that
wound under the windows of the pavilion,
and a gentleman pa&s;&s;ed on hor&s;eback, who&s;e
re&s;emblance to Valancourt, in air and figure,
for the twilight did not permit a view of
his features, immediately &s;truck her. She
retired ha&s;tily from the lattice, fearing to
be &s;een, yet wi&s;hing to ob&s;erve further,
while the &s;tranger pa&s;&s;ed on without look|ing
up, and, when &s;he returned to the lattice,
&s;he &s;aw him faintly through the twilight,
winding under the high trees, that led to
Tholou&s;e. This little incident &s;o much di&s;|turbed
her &s;pirits, that the temple and its
&s;cenery were no longer intere&s;ting to her,
<PB N="331" REF="343">
and, after walking a while on the terrace, &s;he
returned to the chateau.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron, whether &s;he had &s;een a
rival admired, had lo&s;t at play, or had wit|ne&s;&s;ed
an entertainment more &s;plendid than
her own, was returned from her vi&s;it with
a temper more than u&s;ually di&s;compo&s;ed;
and Emily was glad, when the hour arrived,
in which &s;he could retire to the &s;olitude of
her own apartment.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he was &s;um|moned
to Madame Cheron, who&s;e counte|nance
was inflamed with re&s;entment, and,
as Emily advanced, &s;he held out a letter to
her.</P>
<P>"Do you know this hand?" &s;aid &s;he, in
a &s;evere tone, and with a look that was in|tended,
to &s;earch her heart, while Emily ex|amined
the letter attentively, and a&s;&s;ured
her, that &s;he did not.</P>
<P>"Do not provoke me," &s;aid her aunt;
"you do know it, confe&s;s the truth imme|diately.
I in&s;i&s;t upon your confe&s;&s;ing the
truth in&s;tantly."</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="344">
Emily was &s;ilent, and turned to leave the
room, but Madame called her back. "O
you are guilty then," &s;aid &s;he, "you do
know the hand." "If you was before in
doubt of this, madam," replied Emily calm|ly,
"why did you accu&s;e me of having
told a fal&s;ehood." Madame Cheron did not
blu&s;h; but her niece did, a moment after,
when &s;he heard the name of Valancourt. It
was not, however, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
de&s;erving reproof, for, if &s;he ever had &s;een
his hand-writing, the pre&s;ent characters did
not bring it to her recollection.</P>
<P>"It is u&s;ele&s;s to deny it," &s;aid Madame
Cheron, "I &s;ee in your countenance, that
you are no &s;tranger to this letter; and, I
dare &s;ay, you have received many &s;uch from
this impertinent young man, without my
knowledge, in my own hou&s;e."</P>
<P>Emily, &s;hocked at the indelicacy of this
accu&s;ation, &s;till more than by the vulgarity
of the former, in&s;tantly forgot the pride, that
had impo&s;ed &s;ilence, and endeavoured to
<PB N="333" REF="345">
vindicate her&s;elf from the a&s;per&s;ion, but Ma|dame
Cheron was not to be convinced.</P>
<P>"I cannot &s;uppo&s;e," &s;he re&s;umed, "that
this young man would have taken the liberty
of writing to me, if you had not encouraged
him to do &s;o, and I mu&s;t now"&mdash;"You
will allow me to remind you, madam," &s;aid
Emily timidly, "of &s;ome particulars of a
conver&s;ation we had at La Vall&eacute;e. I then
told you truly, that I had only not forbade
Mon&s;ieur Valancourt from addre&s;&s;ing my
family."</P>
<P>"I will not be interrupted," &s;aid Madame
Cheron, interrupting her niece, "I was go|ing
to &s;ay&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have forgot what I was
going to &s;ay. But how happened it that you
did not forbid him?" Emily was &s;ilent.
"How happened it that you encouraged
him to trouble me with this letter?&mdash;A
young man that nobody knows;&mdash;an utter
&s;tranger in the place,&mdash;a young adventurer,
no doubt, who is looking out for a good
fortune. However, on that point he has
mi&s;taken his aim."</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="346">
"His family was known to my father,"
&s;aid Emily mode&s;tly; and without appear|ing
to be &s;en&s;ible of the la&s;t &s;entence.</P>
<P>"O! that is no recommendation at all,"
replied her aunt, with her u&s;ual readine&s;s
upon this topic; "he took &s;uch &s;trange
fanci&egrave;s to people! He was always judging
per&s;ons by their countenances, and was con|tinually
deceived." "Yet it was but now,
madam, that you judged me guilty by my
countenance," &s;aid Emily, with a de&s;ign of
reproving Madame Cheron, to which &s;he
was induced by this di&s;re&s;pectful mention of
her father.</P>
<P>"I called you here," re&s;umed her aunt,
colouring, "to tell you, that I will not be
di&s;turbed in my own hou&s;e by any letters, or
vi&s;its from young men, who may take a
fancy to flatter you. This M. de Valantine&mdash;I
think you call him, has the imperti|nence
to beg I will permit him to pay his
re&s;pects to me! I &s;hall &s;end him a proper
an&s;wer. And for you, Emily, I repeat it
once for all&mdash;if you are not contented to
<PB N="335" REF="347">
conform to my directions, and to my way
of life, I &s;hall give up the ta&s;k of overlook|ing
your conduct&mdash;I &s;hall no longer trouble
my&s;elf with your education, but &s;hall &s;end
you to board in a convent."</P>
<P>"Dear madam," &s;aid Emily, bur&s;ting
into tears, and overcome by the rude &s;u&s;|picions
her aunt had expre&s;&s;ed, "how have
I de&s;erved the&s;e reproofs!" She could &s;ay
no more; and &s;o very fearful was &s;he of
acting with any degree of impropriety in the
affair it&s;elf, that, at the pre&s;ent moment,
Madame Cheron might perhaps have pre|vailed
with her to bind her&s;elf by a promi&s;e
to renounce Valancourt for ever. Her mind,
weakened by her terrors, would no longer
&s;uffer her to view him as &s;he had formerly
done; &s;he feared the error of her own judg|ment,
not that of Madame Cheron, and
feared al&s;o, that, in her former conver&s;ation
with him, at La Vall&eacute;e, &s;he had not con|ducted
her&s;elf with &s;ufficient re&s;erve. She
knew, that &s;he did not de&s;erve the coar&s;e
&s;u&s;picions, which her aunt had thrown out,
<PB N="336" REF="348">
but a thou&s;and &s;cruples ro&s;e to torment her,
&s;uch as would never have di&s;turbed the
peace of Madame Cheron. Thus rendered
anxious to avoid every opportunity of er|ring,
and willing to &s;ubmit to any re&s;tric|tions,
that her aunt &s;hould think proper,
&s;he expre&s;&s;ed an obedience, to which Ma|dame
Cheron did not give much confidence,
and which &s;he &s;eemed to con&s;ider as the
con&s;equence of either fear, or artifice.</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid &s;he, "promi&s;e me
that you will neither &s;ee this young man,
nor write to him without my con&s;ent."&mdash;"Dear,
madam," replied Emily, "can you
&s;uppo&s;e I would do either, unknown to
you!" "I don't know what to &s;uppo&s;e;
there is no knowing how young women will
act. It is difficult to place any confidence
in them, for they have &s;eldom &s;en&s;e enough
to wi&s;h for the re&s;pect of the world."</P>
<P>"Alas, madam!" &s;aid Emily, "I am
anxious for my own re&s;pect; my father
taught me the value of that; he &s;aid if I de|&s;erved
<PB N="337" REF="349">
my own e&s;teem, that of the world
would follow of cour&s;e."</P>
<P>"My brother was a good kind of a man,"
replied Madame Cheron, "but he did not
know the world. I am &s;ure I have always
felt a proper re&s;pect for my&s;elf, yet&mdash;"
She &s;topped, but &s;he might have added, that
the world had not always &s;hewn re&s;pect to
her, and this without impeaching its judg|ment.</P>
<P>"Well!" re&s;umed Madame Cheron,
"you have not given me the promi&s;e,
though, that I demand." Emily readily
gave it, and, being then &s;uffered to with|draw,
&s;he walked in the garden; tried to
compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and, at length, arrived
at her favourite pavilion at the end of the
terrace, where, &s;eating her&s;elf at one of the
embowered windows, that opened upon a
balcony, the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;eclu&s;ion of the
&s;cene allowed her to recollect her thoughts,
and to arrange them &s;o as to form a clearer
judgment of her former conduct. She en|deavoured
to review with exactne&s;s all the
<PB N="338" REF="350">
particulars of her conver&s;ation with Valan|court
at La Vall&eacute;e, had the &s;atisfaction to
ob&s;erve nothing, that could alarm her deli|cate
pride, and thus to be confirmed in the
&s;elf-e&s;teem, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to her
peace. Her mind then became tranquil,
and &s;he &s;aw Valancourt amiable and intelli|gent,
as he had formerly appeared, and Ma|dame
Cheron neither the one, or the other.
The remembrance of her lover, however,
brought with it many very painful emo|tions,
for it by no means reconciled her to
the thought of re&s;igning him; and, Madame
Cheron having already &s;hewn how highly
&s;he di&s;approved of the attachment, &s;he fore|&s;aw
much &s;uffering from the oppo&s;ition of
intere&s;ts; yet with all this was mingled a
degree of delight, which, in &s;pite of rea&s;on,
partook of hope. She determined, however,
that no con&s;ideration &s;hould induce her to
permit a ciande&s;tine corre&s;pondence, and to
ob&s;erve in her conver&s;ation with Valancourt,
&s;hould they ever meet again, the &s;ame nicety
of re&s;erve, which had hitherto marked her
<PB N="339" REF="351">
conduct. As &s;he repeated the words&mdash;"&s;hould
we ever meet again!" &s;he &s;hrunk
as if this was a circum&s;tance, which had
never before occurred to her, and tears came
to her eyes, which &s;he ha&s;tily dried, for &s;he
heard foot&s;teps approaching, and then the
door of the pavilion open, and, on turning,
&s;he &s;aw&mdash;Valancourt. An emotion of mingled
plea&s;ure, &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion pre&s;&s;ed
&s;o &s;uddenly upon her heart as almo&s;t to
overcome her &s;pirits; the colour left her
cheeks, then returned brighter than before,
and &s;he was for a moment unable to &s;peak,
or to ri&s;e from her chair. His countenance
was the mirror, in which &s;he &s;aw her own
emotions reflected, and it rou&s;ed her to self-command.
The joy, which had animated
his features, when he entered the pavilion,
was &s;uddenly repre&s;&s;ed, as, approaching, he
perceived her agitation, and, in a tremulous
voice, enquired after her health. Recovered
from her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he an&s;wered him
with a tempered &s;mile; but a variety of op|po&s;ite
emotions &s;till a&s;&s;ailed her heart, and
<PB N="340" REF="352">
&s;truggled to &s;ubdue the mild dignity of her
manner. It was difficult to tell which pre|dominated&mdash;the
joy of &s;eeing Valancourt, or
the terror of her aunt's di&s;plea&s;ure, when &s;he
&s;hould hear of this meeting. After &s;ome
&s;hort and embarra&s;&s;ed conver&s;ation, &s;he led
him into the gardens, and enquired if he
had &s;een Madame Cheron." "No," &s;aid
he, "I have not yet &s;een her, for they told
me &s;he was engaged, and as &s;oon as I
learned that you were in the gardens, I came
hither." He pau&s;ed a moment, in great agi|tation,
and then added, "May I venture to
tell you the purport of my vi&s;it, without
incurring your di&s;plea&s;ure, and to hope,
that you will not accu&s;e me of precipitation
in now availing my&s;elf of the permi&s;&s;ion
you once gave me of addre&s;&s;ing your fa|mily?"
Emily, who knew not what to re|ply,
was &s;pared from further perplexity, and
was &s;en&s;ible only of fear, when, on rai&s;ing
her eyes, &s;he &s;aw Madame Cheron turn into
the avenue. As the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inno|cence
returned, this fear was &s;o far di&s;&s;ipated
<PB N="341" REF="353">
as to permit her to appear tranquil, and,
in&s;tead of avoiding her aunt, &s;he advanced
with Valancourt to meet her. The look of
haughty and impatient di&s;plea&s;ure, with which
Madame Cheron regarded them, made Emily
&s;hrink, who under&s;tood from a &s;ingle glance,
that this meeting was believed to have been
more than accidental: having mentioned
Valancourt's name, &s;he became again too
much agitated to remain with them, and
returned into the chateau; where &s;he
awaited long, in a &s;tate of trembling anxiety,
the conclu&s;ion of the conference. She
knew not how to account for Valancourt's
vi&s;it to her aunt, before he had received the
permi&s;&s;ion he &s;olicited, &s;ince &s;he was ignorant
of a circum&s;tance, which would have rendered
the reque&s;t u&s;ele&s;s, even if Madame Cheron
had been inclined to grant it. Valancourt,
in the agitation of his &s;pirits, had forgotten
to date his letter, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible
for Madame Cheron to return an an&s;wer;
and, when he recollected this circum&s;tance,
he was, perhaps, not &s;o &s;orry for the omi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="342" REF="354">
as glad of the excu&s;e it allowed him
for waiting on her before &s;he could &s;end a
refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron had a long conver&s;ation
with Valancourt, and, when &s;he returned to
the chateau, her countenance expre&s;&s;ed ill
humour, but not the degree of &s;everity,
which Emily had apprehended. "I have
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed this young man, at la&s;t," &s;aid &s;he,
"and I hope my hou&s;e will never again
be di&s;turbed with &s;imilar vi&s;its. He a&s;|&s;ures
me, that your interview was not pre|concerted."</P>
<P>"Dear madam!" &s;aid Emily in extreme
emotion, "you &s;urely did not a&s;k him the
que&s;tion!" "Mo&s;t certainly I did; you
could not &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould be &s;o imprudent
as to neglect it."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what
an opinion mu&s;t he form of me, &s;ince you,
Madam, could expre&s;s a &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch
ill conduct!"</P>
<P>"It is of very little con&s;equence what
opinion he may form of you," replied her
<PB N="343" REF="355">
aunt, "for I have put an end to the affair;
but I believe he will not form a wor&s;e opi|nion
of me for my prudent conduct. I let
him &s;ee, that I was not to be trifled with;
and that I had more delicacy, than to permit
any clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence to be carried
on in my hou&s;e."</P>
<P>Emily had frequently heard Madame Che|ron
u&s;e the word delicacy, but &s;he was now
more than u&s;ually perplexed to under&s;tand
how &s;he meant to apply it in this in&s;tance,
in which her whole conduct appeared to
merit the very rever&s;e of the term.</P>
<P>"It was very incon&s;iderate of my bro|ther,"
re&s;umed Madame Cheron, "to leave
the trouble of overlooking your conduct to
me; I wi&s;h you was well &s;ettled in life. But if
I find, that I am to be further troubled with
&s;uch vi&s;itors as this M. Valancourt, I &s;hall
place you in a convent at once;&mdash;&s;o remember
the alternative. This young man has the im|pertinence
to own to me,&mdash;he owns it! that
his fortune is very &s;mall, and that he is
chiefly dependent on an elder brother and
<PB N="344" REF="356">
on the profe&s;&s;ion he has cho&s;en! He &s;hould
have concealed the&s;e circum&s;tances, at lea&s;t,
if he expected to &s;ucceed with me. Had he
the pre&s;umption to &s;uppo&s;e I would marry
my niece to a per&s;on &s;uch as he de&s;cribes
him&s;elf!"</P>
<P>Emily dried her tears when &s;he heard of
the candid confe&s;&s;ion of Valancourt; and,
though the circum&s;tances it di&s;covered were
afflicting to her hopes, his artle&s;s conduct
gave her a degree of plea&s;ure, that overcame
every other emotion. But &s;he was compelled,
even thus early in life, to ob&s;erve, that good
&s;en&s;e and noble integrity are not always &s;uf|ficient
to cope with folly and narrow cun|ning;
and her heart was pure enough to al|low
her, even at this trying moment, to look
with more pride on the defeat of the former,
than with mortification on the conque&s;ts of
the latter.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron pur&s;ued her triumph.&mdash;"He
has al&s;o thought proper to tell me,
that he will receive his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from no
per&s;on but your&s;elf; this favour, however,
<PB N="345" REF="357">
I have ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed him. He &s;hall
learn, that it is quite &s;ufficient, that I di&s;ap|prove
him. And I take this opportunity of
repeating,&mdash;that if you concert any means of
interview unknown to me, you &s;hall leave
my hou&s;e immediately."</P>
<P>"How little do you know me, madam,
that you &s;hould think &s;uch an injunction
nece&s;&s;ary!" &s;aid Emily, trying to &s;uppre&s;s
her emotion, "how little of the dear pa|rents,
who educated me!"</P>
<P>Madame Cheron now went to dre&s;s for an
engagement, which &s;he had made for the
evening; and Emily, who would gladly
have been excu&s;ed from attending her aunt,
did not a&s;k to remain at home le&s;t her reque&s;t
&s;hould be attributed to an improper motive.
When &s;he retired to her own room, the little
fortitude, which had &s;upported her in the
pre&s;ence of her relation, for&s;ook her; &s;he re|membered
only that Valancourt, who&s;e cha|racter
appeared more amiable from every
circum&s;tance, that unfolded it, was bani&s;hed
from her pre&s;ence, perhaps, for ever, and
<PB N="346" REF="358">
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed the time in weeping, which, ac|cording
to her aunt's direction, &s;he ought to
have employed in dre&s;&s;ing. This important
duty was, however, quickly di&s;patched;
though, when &s;he joined Madame Cheron
at table, her eyes betrayed, that &s;he had been
in tears, and drew upon her a &s;evere re|proof.</P>
<P>Her efforts to appear cheerful did not en|tirely
fail when &s;he joined the company at the
hou&s;e of Madame Clairval, an elderly widow
lady, who had lately come to re&s;ide at Tho|louse,
on an e&s;tate of her late hu&s;band. She had
lived many years at Paris in a &s;plendid &s;tyle;
had naturally a gay temper, and, &s;ince her
re&s;idence at Tholou&s;e, had given &s;ome of the
mo&s;t magnificent entertainments, that had
been &s;een in that neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The&s;e excited not only the envy, but the
trifling ambition of Madame Cheron, who,
&s;ince &s;he could not rival the &s;plendour of
her fe&s;tivities, was de&s;irous of being ranked
in the number of her mo&s;t intimate friends.
For this purpo&s;e &s;he paid her the mo&s;t ob|&s;equious
<PB N="347" REF="359">
&s;equious attention, and made a point of being
di&s;engaged, whenever &s;he received an invi|tation
from Madame Clairval, of whom &s;he
talked, wherever &s;he went, and derived much
&s;elf-con&s;equence from impre&s;&s;ing a belief
on her general acquaintance, that they were
on the mo&s;t familiar footing.</P>
<P>The entertainments of this evening con|&s;i&s;ted
of a ball and &s;upper; it was a fancy
ball, and the company danced in groups in
the gardens, which were very exten&s;ive.
The high and luxuriant trees, under which
the groups a&s;&s;embled, were illuminated with
a profu&s;ion of lamps, di&s;po&s;ed with ta&s;te and
fancy. The gay and various dre&s;&s;es of the
company, &s;ome of whom were &s;eated on the
turf, conver&s;ing at their ea&s;e, ob&s;erving
the cotillons, taking refre&s;hments, and &s;ome|times
touching &s;portively a guitar; the
gallant manners of the gentlemen, the ex|qui&s;itely
capricious air of the ladies; the
light fanta&s;tic &s;teps of their dances; the mu|&s;icians,
with the lute, the hautboy, and the
tabor, &s;eated at the foot of an elm, and the
<PB N="348" REF="360">
&s;ylvan &s;cenery of woods around were cir|cumstances,
that unitedly formed a charac|teri&s;tic
and &s;triking picture of French fe&s;ti|vity.
Emily &s;urveyed the gaiety of the &s;cene
with a melancholy kind of plea&s;ure, and her
emotion may be imagined when, as &s;he &s;tood
with her aunt, looking at one of the groups,
&s;he perceived Valancourt; &s;aw him dancing
with a young and beautiful lady, &s;aw him
conver&s;ing with her with a mixture of at|tention
and familiarity, &s;uch as &s;he had &s;el|dom
ob&s;erved in his manner. She turned
ha&s;tily from the &s;cene, and attempted to
draw away Madame Cheron, who was con|versing
with Signor Cavigni, and neither
perceived Valancourt, or was willing to
be interrupted. A faintne&s;s &s;uddenly came
over Emily, and, unable to &s;upport her&s;elf,
&s;he &s;at down on a turf bank beneath the
trees, where &s;everal other per&s;ons were
&s;eated. One of the&s;e, ob&s;erving the ex|treme
palene&s;s of her countenance, enquired
if &s;he was ill, and begged &s;he would allow
him to fetch her a gla&s;s of water, for which
<PB N="349" REF="361">
politene&s;s &s;he thanked him, but did not
accept it. Her apprehen&s;ion le&s;t Valan|court
&s;hould ob&s;erve her emotion made her
anxious to overcome it, and &s;he &s;ucceeded
&s;o far as to re-compo&s;e her countenance.
Madame Cheron was &s;till conversing with
Cavigni; and the Count Bauvillers, who
had addre&s;&s;ed Emily, made &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions
upon the &s;cene; to which &s;he an&s;wered
almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, for her mind was &s;till
occupied with the idea of Valancourt, to
whom it was with extreme unea&s;ine&s;s that
&s;he remained &s;o near. Some remarks, how|ever,
which the Count made upon the dance
obliged her to turn her eyes towards it, and,
at that moment, Valancourt's met hers. Her
colour faded again, &s;he felt, that &s;he was re|lapsing
into faintne&s;s, and in&s;tantly averted
her looks, but not before &s;he had ob&s;erved
the altered countenance of Valancourt, on
perceiving her. She would have left the
&s;pot immediately, had &s;he not been con&s;ci|ous,
that this conduct would have &s;hewn
him more obviou&s;ly the intere&s;t he held in
<PB N="350" REF="362">
her heart; and, having tried to attend to
the Count's conver&s;ation and to join in it,
&s;he, at length, recovered her &s;pirits. But,
when he made &s;ome ob&s;ervation on Valan|court's
partner, the fear of &s;hewing, that &s;he
was intere&s;ted in the remark, would have
betrayed it to him, had not the Count,
while he &s;poke, looked towards the per&s;on
of whom he was &s;peaking. "The lady,"
&s;aid he, "dancing with that young cheva|lier,
who appears to be accompli&s;hed in
every thing, but in dancing, is ranked
among the beauties of Tholou&s;e. She is
hand&s;ome, and her fortune will be very
large, I hope &s;he will make a better choice
in a partner for life than &s;he has done in a
partner for the dance, for I ob&s;erve he has
ju&s;t put the &s;et into great confu&s;ion; he does
nothing but commit blunders. I am &s;urpri&s;ed,
that, with his air and figure, he has
not taken more care to accompli&s;h him&s;elf
in dancing."</P>
<P>Emily, who&s;e heart trembled at every
word, that was now uttered, endeavoured to
<PB N="351" REF="363">
turn the conver&s;ation from Valancourt, by
enquiring the name of the lady, with whom
he danced; but, before the Count could re|ply,
the dance concluded, and Emily, per|ceiving
that Valancourt was coming towards
her, ro&s;e and joined Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"Here is the Chevalier Valancourt, ma|dam,"
&s;aid &s;he in a whi&s;per, "pray let us
go." Her aunt immediately moved on, but
not before Valancourt had reached them, who
bowed lowly to Madame Cheron, and with
an earne&s;t and dejected look to Emily, with
whom, notwith&s;tanding all her effort, an air
of more than common re&s;erve prevailed.
The pre&s;ence of Madame Cheron prevented
Valancourt from remaining, and he pa&s;&s;ed
on with a countenance, who&s;e melancholy
reproached her for having increa&s;ed it.
Emily was called from the mu&s;ing fit, into
which he had fallen, by the Count Bauvil|lers,
who was known to her aunt.</P>
<P>"I have your pardon to beg, ma'am&s;elle,"
&s;aid he, "for a rudene&s;s, which you will
readily believe was quite, unintentional. I
<PB N="352" REF="364">
did not know, that the Chevalier was your
acquaintance, when I &s;o freely critici&s;ed his
dancing." Emily blu&s;hed and &s;miled, and
Madame Cheron &s;pared her the difficulty of
replying. "If you mean the per&s;on, who
has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed us," &s;aid &s;he, "I can a&s;&s;ure
you he is no acquaintance of either mine, or
ma'am&s;elle St. Aubert's: I know nothing
of him."</P>
<P>"O! that is the chevalier Valancourt,"
&s;aid Cavigni carele&s;sly, and looking back.
"You know him then?" &s;aid Madame Che|ron.
"I am not acquainted with him," re|plied
Cavigni. "You don't know, then, the
rea&s;on I have to call him impertinent;&mdash;he
as had the pre&s;umption to admire my niece!"</P>
<P>"If every man de&s;erves the title of im|pertinent,
who admires ma'am&s;elle St. Au|bert,
"replied Cavigni, "I fear there are
a great many impertinents, and I am will|ing
to acknowledge my&s;elf one of the num|ber."</P>
<P>"O &s;ignor!" &s;aid Madame Cheron, with
an affected &s;mile, "I perceive you have
<PB N="353" REF="365">
learnt the art of complimenting, &s;ince you
came into France. But it is cruel to com|pliment
children, &s;ince they mi&s;take flattery
for truth."</P>
<P>Cavigni turned away his face for a mo|ment,
and then &s;aid with a &s;tudied air,
"Whom then are we to compliment, madam?
for it would be ab&s;urd to compliment a wo|man
of refined under&s;tanding; <HI>&s;he</HI> is above
all prai&s;e." As he fini&s;hed the &s;entence
he gave Emily a &s;ly look, and the &s;mile, that
had lurked in his eye, &s;tole forth. She per|fectly
under&s;tood it, and blu&s;hed for Ma|dame
Cheron, who replied, "You are per|fectly
right, &s;ignor, no woman of under|&s;tanding
can endure compliment."</P>
<P>"I have heard &s;ignor Montoni &s;ay," re|joined
Cavigni, "that he never knew but
one woman who de&s;erved it."</P>
<P>"Well!" exclaimed Madame Cheron,
with a &s;hort laugh, and a &s;mile of unutterable
complacency, "and who could &s;he be?"</P>
<P>"O!" replied Cavigni, "it is impo&s;&s;ible
to mi&s;take her, for certainly there is not
<PB N="354" REF="366">
more than one woman in the world, who
has both the merit to de&s;erve compliment
and the wit to refu&s;e it. Mo&s;t women re|ver&s;e
the ca&s;e entirely." He looked again
at Emily, who blu&s;hed deeper than before
for her aunt, and turned from him with di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Well, &s;ignor!" &s;aid Madame Cheron,
"I prote&s;t you are a Frenchman; I never
heard a foreigner &s;ay any thing half &s;o gal|lant
as that!"</P>
<P>"True, madam," &s;aid the Count, who
had been &s;ome time &s;ilent, and with a low
bow, "but the gallantry of the compliment
had been utterly lo&s;t, but for the ingenuity
that di&s;covered the application."</P>
<P>Madame Cheron did not perceive the
meaning of this too &s;atirical &s;entence, and
&s;he, therefore, e&s;caped the pain, which Emi|ly
felt on her account. "O! here comes
&s;ignor Montoni him&s;elf," &s;aid her aunt, "I
prote&s;t I will tell him all the fine things
you have been &s;aying to me." The &s;ignor,
however, pa&s;&s;ed at this moment into another
<PB N="355" REF="367">
walk. "Pray, who is it, that has &s;o much
engaged your friend this evening?" a&s;ked
Madame Cheron, with an air of chagrin,
"I have not &s;een him once."</P>
<P>"He hid a very particular engagement
with the Marquis I a Rivi&egrave;re," replied Ca|vigni,
"which has detained him, I per|ceive,
till this moment, or he would have
done him&s;elf the honour of paying his re|spects
to you, madam, &s;ooner, as he com|mi&s;&s;ioned
me to &s;ay. But, I know not how
it is&mdash;your conver&s;ation is &s;o fa&s;cinating&mdash;that
it can charm even memory, I think, or
I &s;hould certainly have delivered my friend's
apology before."</P>
<P>"The apology, fir, would have been more
&s;atisfactory from him&s;elf," &s;aid Madame
Cheron, who&s;e vanity was more mortified by
Montoni's neglect, than flattered by Ca|vigni's
compliment. Her manner, at this
moment, and Cavigni's late conver&s;ation,
now awakened a &s;u&s;picion inEmily's mind,
which, notwith&s;tanding that &s;ome recol|lections
&s;erved to confirm it appeared prepo|&s;terous.
<PB N="356" REF="368">
She thought &s;he perceived, that
Montoni was paying &s;erious addre&s;&s;es to
her aunt, and that &s;he not only accepted
them, but was jealou&s;ly watchful of any
appearance of neglect on his part.&mdash;That
Madame Cheron at her years &s;hould
elect a &s;econd hu&s;band was ridiculous,
though her vanity made it not impo&s;&s;ible;
but that Montoni, with his di&s;cernment,
his figure, and preten&s;ions, &s;hould make a
choice of Madame Cheron&mdash;appeared mo&s;t
wonderful. Her thoughts, however, did
not dwell long on the &s;ubject; nearer inte|re&s;ts
pre&s;&s;ed upon them; Valancourt, re|jected
of her aunt, and Valancourt dancing
with a gay and beautiful partner, alternately
tormented her mind. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along
the gardens &s;he looked timidly forward, half
fearing and half hoping that he might
appear in the crowd; and the di&s;appoint|ment
&s;he felt on not &s;eeing him, told her,
that &s;he had hoped more than &s;he had feared.</P>
<P>Montoni &s;oon after joined the party.
He muttered over &s;ome &s;hort &s;peech about
<PB N="357" REF="369">
regret for having been &s;o long detained
el&s;ewhere, when he knew he &s;hould have the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Madame Cheron here; and
&s;he, receiving the apology with the air of a
petti&s;h girl, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf entirely to Ca|vigni,
who looked archly at Montoni, as if
he would have &s;aid, "I will not triumph
over you too much; I will have the good|ne&s;s
to bear my honours meekly; but look
&s;harp, &s;ignor, or I &s;hall certainly run away
with your prize."</P>
<P>The &s;upper was &s;erved in different pavi|lions
in the gardens, as well as in one large
&s;aloon of the chateau, and with more of
ta&s;te, than either of &s;plendour, or even of
plenty. Madame Cheron and her party
&s;upped with Madame Clairval in the sa|loon,
and Emily, with difficulty, di&s;gui&s;ed
her emotion, when &s;he &s;aw Valancourt placed
at the &s;ame table with her&s;elf. There, Ma|dame
Cheron having &s;urveyed him with
high di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid to &s;ome per&s;on who
&s;at next to her, "Pray, who <HI>is</HI> that young
man?" "It is the Chevalier Valancourt,"
was the an&s;wer. "Yes, I am not ignorant
<PB N="358" REF="370">
of his name, but who is this Chevalier Va|lancourt
that thus intrudes him&s;elf at this
table?" The attention of the per&s;on, to
whom &s;he &s;poke, was called off before &s;he
received a &s;econd reply. The table, at
which they &s;at, was very long, and, Valan|court
being &s;eated, with his partner, near
the bottom, and Emily near the top, the
di&s;tance between them may account for his
not immediately perceiving her. She avoid|ed
looking to that end of the table, but,
whenever her eyes happened to glance to|wards
it, &s;he ob&s;erved him conver&s;ing
with his beautiful companion, and the ob|&s;ervation
did not contribute to re&s;tore her
peace, any more than the accounts &s;he
heard of the fortune and accompli&s;hments of
this &s;ame lady.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron, to whom the&s;e remarks
were &s;ometimes addre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they &s;up|ported
topics for trivial conver&s;ation, &s;eemed
indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate
Valancourt, towards whom &s;he felt all the
petty re&s;entment of a narrow pride, "I
<PB N="359" REF="371">
admire the lady," &s;aid &s;he, "but I mu&s;t
condemn her choice of a partner." "Oh,
the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed young men we have," replied
the lady, to whom this remark was ad|dre&s;&s;ed;
"it is whi&s;pered, that Mademoi|&s;elle
D'Emery, and her very large fortune,
are to be his."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" exclaimed Madame Che|ron,
reddening with vexation," it is impo&s;&s;i|ble
that &s;he can be &s;o de&s;titute of ta&s;te; he
has &s;o little the air of a per&s;on of condition,
that, if I did not &s;ee him at the table of
Madame Clairval, I &s;hould never have &s;u&s;|pected
him to be one. I have be&s;ides par|ticular
rea&s;ons for believing the report to
be erroneous."</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt the truth of it," replied
the lady gravely, di&s;gu&s;ted by the abrupt
contradiction &s;he had received, concerning
her opinion of Valancourt's merit. "You
will, perhaps, doubt it," &s;aid Madame
Cheron, "when I a&s;&s;ure you, that it was
only this morning that I rejected his &s;uit."
<PB N="360" REF="372">
This was &s;aid without any intention of im|po&s;ing
the meaning it conveyed, but &s;imply
from a habit of con&s;idering her&s;elf to be the
mo&s;t important per&s;on in every affair that
concerned her niece, and becau&s;e literally
&s;he had rejected Valancourt. "Your rea|&s;ons
are indeed &s;uch as cannot be doubted,"
replied the lady, with an ironical &s;mile.&mdash;"Any
more than the di&s;cernment of the
Chevalier Valancourt," added Cavigni,
who &s;tood by the chair of Madame Che|ron,
and had heard her arrogate to her&s;elf,
as he thought, a di&s;tinction which had been
paid to her niece. "His di&s;cernment <HI>may</HI>
be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, &s;ignor," &s;aid Madame
Cheron, who was not flattered by what &s;he
under&s;tood to be an encomium upon Emily.</P>
<P>"Alas!" exclaimed Cavigni, &s;urveying
Madame Cheron with affected ec&s;ta&s;y,
"how vain is that a&s;&s;ertion, while that face&mdash;that
&s;hape&mdash;that air&mdash;combine to refute
it! Unhappy Valancourt! his di&s;cernment
has been his de&s;truction."</P>
<P>Emily looked &s;urpri&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed;
the lady, who had lately &s;poken, a&s;toni&s;hed,
<PB N="361" REF="373">
and Madame Cheron, who, though &s;he
did not perfectly under&s;tand this &s;peech,
was very ready to believe her&s;elf compli|mented
by it, &s;aid &s;milingly, "O Signor!
you are very gallant; but tho&s;e, who hear
you vindicate the chevalier's di&s;cernment,
will &s;uppo&s;e that I am the object of it."</P>
<P>"They cannot doubt it," replied Ca|vigni,
bowing low.</P>
<P>"And would not that be very mortify|ing,
Signor?"</P>
<P>"Unque&s;tionably it would," &s;aid Ca|vigni.</P>
<P>"I cannot endure the thought," &s;aid
Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"It is not to be endured," replied Ca|vigni.</P>
<P>"What can be done to prevent &s;o humi|liating a mi&s;take?" rejoined Madame Che|ron.</P>
<P>"Alas! I cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t you," replied Ca|vigni, with a deliberating air. "Your only
chance of refuting the calumny, and of
making people under&s;tand what you wi&s;h
<PB N="362" REF="374">
them to believe, is to per&s;i&s;t in your fir&s;t
a&s;&s;ertion; for, when they are told of the
chevalier's want of di&s;cernment, it is po&s;&s;i|ble
they may &s;uppo&s;e he never pre&s;umed to
di&s;tre&s;s you with his admiration.&mdash;But then
again&mdash;that diffidence, which renders you
&s;o in&s;en&s;ible to your own perfections&mdash;they
will con&s;ider this, and Valancourt's ta&s;te
will not be doubted, though you arraign it.
In &s;hort, they will, in &s;pite of your endea|vours,
continue to believe, what might very
naturally have occurred to them without
any hint of mine&mdash;that the chevalier has
ta&s;te enough to admire a beautiful woman."</P>
<P>"All this is very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing!" &s;aid Ma|dame
Cheron, with a profound &s;igh.</P>
<P>"May I be allowed to a&s;k what is &s;o
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing?" &s;aid Madame Clairval, who
was &s;truck with the rueful countenance and
doleful accent, with which this was deli|vered.</P>
<P>"It is a delicate &s;ubject," replied Madame
Cheron, "a very mortifying one to me."
"I am concerned to hear it," &s;aid Ma|dame
<PB N="363" REF="375">
dame Clairval, "I hope nothing has oc|curred,
this evening, particularly to di|&s;tre&s;s you?"
"Alas, yes! within this half
hour; and I know not where the report
may end;&mdash;my pride was never &s;o &s;hocked
before, but I a&s;&s;ure yon the report is to|tally
void of foundation." "Good God!"
exclaimed Madame Clairval, "what can be
done? Can you point out any way, by
which I can a&s;&s;i&s;t, or con&s;ole you?"</P>
<P>"The only way, by which you can do
either," replied Madame Cheron, "is to
contradict the report wherever you go."</P>
<P>"Well! but pray inform me what I am
to contradict."</P>
<P>"It is &s;o very humiliating, that I know
not how to mention it," continued Madame
Cheron, "but you &s;hall judge. Do you
ob&s;erve that young man &s;eated near the bot|tom
of the table, who is conver&s;ing with
Mademoi&s;elle D'Emery?" "Yes, I per|ceive
whom you mean." "You ob&s;erve
how little he has the air of a per&s;on of con|dition;
I was &s;aying ju&s;t now, that I &s;hould
<PB N="364" REF="376">
not have thought him a gentleman, if I
had not &s;een him at this table." "Well!
but the report," &s;aid Madame Clairva,
"let me under&s;tand the &s;ubject of your di|&s;tre&s;s."
"Ah! the &s;ubject of my di&s;tre&s;s,"
replied Madame Cheron; "this per&s;on,
whom nobody knows&mdash;(I beg pardon, ma|dam,
I did not con&s;ider what I &s;aid)&mdash;this
impertinent young man, having had the
pre&s;umption to addre&s;s my niece, has, I
fear, given ri&s;e to a report, that he had de|clared
him&s;elf my admirer. Now only con|&s;ider
how very mortifying &s;uch a report mu&s;t
be! You, I know, will feel for my &s;itu|ation.
A woman of my condition!&mdash;think
how degrading even the rumour of &s;uch
an alliance mu&s;t be."</P>
<P>"Degrading indeed, my poor friend!"
&s;aid Madame Clairval. "You may rely upon
it I will contradict the report wherever I
go;"
as &s;he &s;aid which, &s;he turned her at|tention
upon another part of the company;
and Cavigni, who had hitherto appeared a
grave &s;pectator of the &s;cene, now fearing
<PB N="365" REF="377">
he &s;hould be unable to &s;mother the laugh,
that convul&s;ed him, walked abruptly away.</P>
<P>"I perceive you do not know," &s;aid the
lady who &s;at near Madame Cheron, "that
the gentleman you have been &s;peaking of is
Madame Clairval's nephew!" "Impo&s;&s;i|ble!"
exclaimed Madame Cheron, who now
began to perceive, that &s;he had been totally
mi&s;taken in her judgment of Valancourt,
and to prai&s;e him aloud with as much &s;er|vility,
as &s;he had before cen&s;ured him with
frivolous malignity.</P>
<P>Emily, who, during the greater part of
this conver&s;ation, had been &s;o ab&s;orbed in
thought as to be &s;pared the pain of hearing
it, was now extremely &s;urpri&s;ed by her
aunt's prai&s;e of Valancourt, with who&s;e
relation&s;hip to Madame Clairval &s;he was
unacquainted; but &s;he was not &s;orry when
Madame Cheron, who, though &s;he now
tried to appear unconcerned, was really much
embarra&s;&s;ed, prepared to withdraw imme|diately
after &s;upper. Montoni then came to
hand Madame Cheron to her carriage, and
Cavigni, with an arch &s;olemnity of counte|nance,
<PB N="366" REF="378">
nance, followed with Emily, who, as she
wi&s;hed them good night, and drew up the
gla&s;s, &s;aw Valancourt among the crowd at
the gates. Before the carriage drove off,
he di&s;appeared. Madame Cheron forbore
to mention him to Emily, and, as &s;oon as
they reached the chateau, they &s;eparated for
the night.</P>
<P>On the following morning, as Emily &s;at
at breakfa&s;t with her aunt, a letter was
brought to her, of which &s;he knew the
hand-writing upon the cover; and, as &s;he
received it with a trembling hand, Madame
Cheron ha&s;tily enquired from whom it
came. Emily, with her leave, broke the
&s;eal, and, ob&s;erving the &s;ignature of Valan|court,
gave it unread to her aunt, who re|ceived
it with impatience; and, as &s;he
looked it over, Emily endeavoured to
read on her countenance its contents. Hav|ing
returned the letter to her niece, who&s;e
eyes a&s;ked if &s;he might examine it, "Yes,
read it, child," &s;aid Madame Cheron, in
a manner le&s;s &s;evere than &s;he had expected,
<PB N="367" REF="379">
and Emily had, perhaps, never before &s;o
willingly obeyed her aunt. In this letter
Valancourt &s;aid little of the interview of
the preceding day, but concluded with de|claring,
that he would accept his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion
from Emily only, and with entreating, that
&s;he would allow him to wait upon her, on
the approaching evening. When &s;he read
this, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the moderation of
Madame Cheron, and looked at her with
timid expectation, as &s;he &s;aid &s;orrowfully&mdash;"What
am I to &s;ay, madam?"</P>
<P>"Why&mdash;we mu&s;t &s;ee the young man, I
believe," replied her aunt, "and hear what
he has further to &s;ay for him&s;elf. You
may tell him he may come." Emily dared
&s;carcely credit what &s;he heard. "Yet, &s;tay,"
added Madame Cheron, "I will tell him &s;o
my&s;elf." She called for pen and ink;
Emily &s;till not daring to tru&s;t the emotions
&s;he felt, and almo&s;t &s;inking beneath them.
Her &s;urpri&s;e would have been le&s;s had &s;he
overheard, on the preceding evening, what
Madame Cheron had not forgotten&mdash;that
<PB N="368" REF="380">
Valancourt was the nephew of Madame
Clairval.</P>
<P>"What were the "particulars of her aunt's
note Emily did not learn, but the re&s;ult was
a vi&s;it from Valancourt in the evening,
whom Madame Cheron received alone,
and they had a long conver&s;ation before
Emily was called down. When &s;he en|tered
the room, her aunt was conver&s;ing
with complacency, and &s;he &s;aw the eyes of
Valancourt, as he impatiently ro&s;e, ani|mated
with hope.</P>
<P>"We have been talking over this affair,"
&s;aid Madame Cheron," the chevalier has
been telling me, that the late Mon&s;ieur
Clairval was the brother of the Counte&s;s de
Duvarney, his mother. I only wi&s;h he had
mentioned his relation&s;hip to Madame
Clairval before, I certainly &s;hould have
con&s;idered that circum&s;tance as a &s;ufficient
introduction to my hou&s;e." Valancourt
bowed, and was going to addre&s;s Emily,
but her aunt prevented him. "I have,
therefore, con&s;ented, that you &s;hall receive
his vi&s;its; and, though I will not bind
<PB N="369" REF="381">
my&s;elf by any promi&s;e, or &s;ay, that I &s;hall
con&s;ider him as my nephew, yet I &s;hall per|mit
the intercour&s;e, and &s;hall look forward
to any further connection as an event,
which may po&s;&s;ibly take place in a cour&s;e
of years, provided the chevalier ri&s;es in his
profe&s;&s;ion, or any circum&s;tance occurs,
which may make it prudent for him to
take a wife. But Mon&s;. Valancourt will
ob&s;erve, and you too, Emily, that, till that
happens, I po&s;itively forbid any thoughts
of marrying."</P>
<P>Emily's countenance, during this coar&s;e
&s;peech, varied every in&s;tant, and, towards
its conclu&s;ion, her di&s;tre&s;s had &s;o much in|crea&s;ed,
that &s;he was on the point of leaving
the room. Valancourt, meanwhile, &s;carcely
le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed, did not dare to look at
her, for whom he was thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but,
when Madame Cheron was &s;ilent, he &s;aid,
"Flattering, madam, as your approbation
is to me&mdash;highly as I am honoured by it&mdash;I
have yet &s;o much to fear, that I &s;carcely
dare to hope." "Pray, &s;ir, explain your-&s;elf,"
<PB N="370" REF="382">
&s;elf," &s;aid Madame Cheron; an unexpected
requi&s;ition, which embarra&s;&s;ed Valancourt
again, and almo&s;t overcame him with confu|&s;ion,
at circum&s;tances, on which, had he been
only a &s;pectator of the &s;cene, he would have
&s;miled.</P>
<P>"Till I receive Mademoi&s;elle St. Au|bert's
permi&s;&s;ion to accept your indul|gence,"
&s;aid he, falteringly&mdash;" till &s;he al|lows
me to hope&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O! is that all?" interrupted Madame
Cheron. "Well, I will take upon me to
an&s;wer for her. But at the &s;ame time, &s;ir,
give me leave to ob&s;erve to you, that I am
her guardian, and that I expect, in every
in&s;tance, that my will is hers."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he ro&s;e and quitted the
room, leaving Emily and Valancourt in a
&s;tate of mutual embarra&s;&s;ment; and, when
Valancourt's hopes enabled him to over|come
his fears, and to addre&s;s her with the
zeal and &s;incerity &s;o natural to him, it was
a con&s;iderable time before &s;he was &s;u&s;fici|ently
<PB N="371" REF="383">
recovered to hear with di&s;tinctne&s;s his
&s;olicitations and enquiries.</P>
<P>The conduct of Madame Cheron in this
affair had been entirely governed by &s;elfi&s;h
vanity. Valancourt, in his fir&s;t interview,
had with great candour laid open to her
the true &s;tate of his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances,
and his future expectancies, and &s;he, with
more prudence than humanity, had ab&s;o|lutely
and abruptly rejected his &s;uit. She
wi&s;hed her niece to marry ambitiou&s;ly, not
becau&s;e &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee her in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the happine&s;s, which rank and
wealth are u&s;ually believed to be&s;tow, but
becau&s;e &s;he de&s;ired to partake the import|ance,
which &s;uch an alliance would give,
When, therefore, &s;he di&s;covered that Va|lancourt
was the nephew of a per&s;on of &s;o
much con&s;equence as Madame Clairval, &s;he
became anxious for the connection, &s;ince
the pro&s;pect it afforded of future fortune
and di&s;tinction for Emily, promi&s;ed the ex|altation
&s;he coveted for her&s;elf. Her cal|culations
concerning fortune in this alli|ance
<PB N="372" REF="384">
were guided rather by her wi&s;hes,
than by any hint of Valancourt or &s;trong
appearance of probability; and, when &s;he
re&s;ted her expectation on the wealth of
Madame Clairval, &s;he &s;eemed totally to have
forgotten, that the latter had a daughter.
Valancourt, however, had not forgotten this
circum&s;tance, and the con&s;ideration of it
had made him &s;o mode&s;t in his expectations
from Madame Clairval, that he had not even
named the relation&s;hip in his fir&s;t conver&s;a|tion
with Madame Cheron. But, whatever
might be the future fortune of Emily, the
pre&s;ent di&s;tinction, which the connection
would afford for her&s;elf; was certain, &s;ince
the &s;plendour of Madame Clairval's e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
was &s;uch as to excite the general
envy and partial imitation of the neigh|bourhood.
Thus had &s;he con&s;ented to
involve her niece in an engagement, to
which &s;he &s;aw only a di&s;tant and uncertain
conclu&s;ion, with as little con&s;ideration of her
happine&s;s, as when &s;he had &s;o precipitately
forbade it: for though &s;he her&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="373" REF="385">
the means of rendering this union not
only certain, but prudent, yet to do &s;o was
no part of her pre&s;ent intention.</P>
<P>From this period Valancourt made fre|quent
vi&s;its to Madame Cheron, and Emily
pa&s;&s;ed in his &s;ociety the happie&s;t hours &s;he
had known &s;ince the death of her father.
They were both too much engaged by the
pre&s;ent moments to give &s;erious con&s;idera|tion
to the future. They loved and were
beloved, and &s;aw not, that the very attach|ment,
which formed the delight of their pre|&s;ent days, might po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion the &s;uf|ferings
of years. Meanwhile, Madame
Cheron's intercour&s;e with Madame Clair|val
became more frequent than before, and
her vanity was already gratified by the op|portunity
of proclaiming, wherever &s;he
went, the attachment that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
their nephew and niece.</P>
<P>Montoni was now al&s;o become a daily
gue&s;t at the chateau, and Emily was com|pelled
to ob&s;erve, that he really was a fui|tor,
and a favoured &s;uitor, to her aunt.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="386">
Thus pa&s;&s;ed the winter months, not only
in peace, but in happine&s;s, to Valancourt
and Emily; the &s;tation of his regiment be|ing
&s;o near Tholou&s;e, as to allow this fre|quent
intercour&s;e. The pavilion on the
terrace was the favourite &s;cene of their in|terviews,
and there Emily, with Madame
Cheron, would work, while Valancourt
read aloud works of genius and ta&s;te, li&s;|tened
to her enthu&s;ia&s;m, expre&s;&s;ed his own,
and caught new opportunities of ob&s;erving,
that their minds were formed to con&s;titute
the happine&s;s of each other, the &s;ame ta&s;te,
the &s;ame noble and benevolent &s;entiments
animating each.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MADAME Cheron's avarice at length
yielded to her vanity. Some very &s;plendid
entertainments, which Madame Clairval had
given, and the general adulation, which was
paid her, made the former more anxious
than before to &s;ecure an alliance, that would
&s;o much exalt her in her own opinion and
in that of the world. She propo&s;ed terms
for the immediate marriage of her niece,
<PB N="376" REF="388">
and offered to give Emily a dower, provided
Madame Clairval ob&s;erved equal terms, on
the part of her nephew. Madame Clairval
li&s;tened to the propo&s;al, and, con&s;idering
that Emily was the apparent heire&s;s of her
aunt's wealth, accepted it. Meanwhile,
Emily knew nothing of the tran&s;action, till
Madame Cheron informed her, that &s;he mu&s;t
make preparation for the nuptials, which
would be celebrated without further delay,
then, a&s;toni&s;hed and wholly unable to ac|count
for this &s;udden conclu&s;ion, which Va|lancourt
had not &s;olicited (for he was igno|rant
of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the elder
ladies and had not dared to hope &s;uch good
fortune), &s;he deci&s;ively objected to it. Ma|dame
Cheron, however, quite as jealous of
contradiction now, as &s;he had been formerly,
contended for a &s;peedy marriage with as
much vehemence as &s;he had formerly op|po&s;ed
whatever had the mo&s;t remote po&s;&s;i|bility
of leading to it; and Emily's &s;cruples
di&s;appeared, when &s;he again &s;aw Valancourt,
who was now informed of the happine&s;s, de|&s;igned
<PB N="377" REF="389">
&s;igned for him, and came to claim a pro|mi&s;e
of it from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>While preparations were making for the&s;e
nuptials, Montoni became the acknowledged
lover of Madame Cheron; and, though
Madame Clairval was much di&s;plea&s;ed,
when &s;he heard of the approaching connec|tion,
and was willing to prevent that of Va|lancourt
with Emily, her con&s;cience told
her, that &s;he had no right thus to trifle with
their peace, and Madame Clairval, though a
woman of fa&s;hion, was far le&s;s advanced
than her friend in the art of deriving &s;atis|faction
from di&s;tinction and admiration, ra|ther
than from con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Emily ob&s;erved with concern the a&s;cen|dancy,
which Montoni had acquired over
Madame Cheron, as well as the increa&s;ing
frequency of his vi&s;its; and her own opinion
of this Italian was confirmed by that of Va|lancourt,
who had always expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;like
of him. As &s;he was, one morning, &s;itting
at work in the pavilion, enjoying the plea|&s;ant
fre&s;hne&s;s of &s;pring, who&s;e colours were
<PB N="378" REF="390">
now &s;pread upon the land&s;cape, and li&s;ten|ing
to Valancourt, who was reading, but
who often laid a&s;ide the book to conver&s;e,
&s;he received a &s;ummons to attend Madame
Cheron immediately, and had &s;carcely en|tered
the dre&s;&s;ing-room, when &s;he ob&s;erved
with &s;urpri&s;e the dejection of her aunt's
countenance, and the contra&s;ted gaiety of
her dre&s;s. "So, niece!"&mdash;&s;aid Madame,
and &s;he &s;topped under &s;ome degree of embar|ra&s;&s;ment.&mdash;"I
&s;ent for you,&mdash;I&mdash;I wi&s;hed
to &s;ee you; I have news to tell you. From
this hour you mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;ignor
Montoni as your uncle&mdash;we were married
this morning."</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;not &s;o much at the marriage,
as at the &s;ecrecy with which it had been con|cluded,
and the agitation with which it was
announced, Emily, at length, attributed
the privacy to the wi&s;h of Montoni, rather
than of her aunt. His wife, however, in|tended,
that the contrary &s;hould be believed,
and therefore added, "You &s;ee I wi&s;hed to
avoid a bu&s;tle; but now the ceremony is
<PB N="379" REF="391">
over I &s;hall do &s;o no longer; and I wi&s;h
to announce to my &s;ervants, that they mu&s;t
receive the &s;ignor Montoni for their ma&s;ter."
Emily made a feeble attempt to congratu|late
her on the&s;e apparently imprudent nup|tials.
"I &s;hall now celebrate my marriage
with &s;ome &s;plendour," continued Madame
Montoni, "and to &s;ave time I &s;hall avail
my&s;elf of the preparation that has been made
for yours, which will, of cour&s;e, be delayed
a little while. Such of your wedding clothes
as are ready I &s;hall expect you will appear
in, to do honour to this fe&s;tival. I al&s;o
wi&s;h you to inform Mon&s;ieur Valancourt,
that I have changed my name, and he will
acquaint Madame Clairval. In a few days
I &s;hall give a grand entertainment, at which
I &s;hall reque&s;t their pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;o lo&s;t in &s;urpri&s;e and various
thought, that &s;he made Madame Montoni
&s;carcely any reply, but, at her de&s;ire, &s;he
returned to inform Valancourt of what had
pa&s;&s;ed. Surpri&s;e was not his predominant
emotion on hearing of the&s;e ha&s;ty nuptials;
<PB N="380" REF="392">
and, when he learned, that they were to be
the means of delaying his own, and that the
very ornaments of the chateau, which had
been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his
Emily, were to be degraded to the celebra|tion
of Madame Montoni's, grief and indig|nation
agitated him alternately. He could
conceal neither from the ob&s;ervation of Emi|ly,
who&s;e efforts to ab&s;tract him from the&s;e
&s;erious emotions, and to laugh at the appre|hen&s;ive
con&s;iderations, that a&s;&s;ailed him,
were ineffectual; and, when, at length, he
took leave, there was an earne&s;t tenderne&s;s
in his manner, that extremely affected her;
&s;he even &s;hed tears, when he di&s;appeared at
the end of the terrace, yet knew not exactly
why &s;he &s;hould do &s;o.</P>
<P>Montoni now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cha|teau
and the command of its inhabitants,
with the ea&s;e of a man, who had long con&s;i|dered
it to be his own. His friend Cavigni,
who had been extremely &s;erviceable, in hav|ing
paid Madame Cheron the attention and
flattery, which &s;he required, but from which
<PB N="381" REF="393">
Montoni too often revolted, had apartments
a&s;&s;igned to him, and received from the do|me&s;tics
an equal degree of obedience with
the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Within a few days, Madame Montoni, as
&s;he had promi&s;ed, gave a magnificent enter|tainment
to a very numerous company,
among whom was Valancourt; but at which
Madame Clairval excu&s;ed her&s;elf from at|tending.
There was a concert, ball and
&s;upper. Valancourt was, of cour&s;e, Emily's
partner, and though, when he gave a look
to the decorations of the apartments, he
could not but remember, that they were de|&s;igned
for other fe&s;tivities, than tho&s;e they
now contributed to celebrate, he endea|voured
to check his concern by con&s;idering,
that a little while only would elap&s;e before
they would be given to their original de&s;ti|nation.
During this evening, Madame Mon|toni
danced, laughed and talked ince&s;&s;antly;
while Montoni, &s;ilent, re&s;erved and &s;ome|what
haughty, &s;eemed weary of the parade,
<PB N="382" REF="394">
and of the frivolous company it had drawn
together.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t and the la&s;t entertain|ment,
given in celebration of their nuptials.
Montoni, though the &s;everity of his temper
and the gloomine&s;s of his pride prevented
him from enjoying &s;uch fe&s;tivities, was ex|tremely
willing to promote them. It was
&s;eldom, that he could meet in any company
a man of more addre&s;s, and &s;till &s;eldomer
one of more under&s;tanding, than him&s;elf;
the balance of advantage in &s;uch parties, or
in the connections, which might ari&s;e from
them, mu&s;t, therefore, be on his &s;ide; and,
knowing, as he did, the &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, for
which they are generally frequented, he had
no objection to mea&s;ure his talents of di&s;&s;i|mulation
with tho&s;e of any other competitor
for di&s;tinction and plunder. But his wife,
who, when her own intere&s;t was immediately
concerned, had &s;ometimes more di&s;cernment
than vanity, acquired a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her
inferiority to other women, in per&s;onal at|tractions,
which, uniting with the jealou&s;y
<PB N="383" REF="395">
natural to the di&s;covery, counteracted his
readine&s;s for mingling with all the parties
Tholou&s;e could afford. Till &s;he had, as
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, the affections of an hu&s;band to
lo&s;e, &s;he had no motive for di&s;covering the
unwelcome truth, and it had never obtruded
it&s;elf upon her; but, now that it influenced
her policy, &s;he oppo&s;ed her hu&s;band's in|clination
for company, with the more eager|ne&s;s,
becau&s;e &s;he believed him to be really as
well received in the female &s;ociety of the
place, as, during his addre&s;&s;es to her, he had
affected to be.</P>
<P>A few weeks only had elap&s;ed, &s;ince the
marriage, when Madame Montoni informed
Emily, that the &s;ignor intended to return to
Italy, as soon as the nece&s;&s;ary preparation
could be made for &s;o long a journey. "We
&s;hall go to Venice," &s;aid &s;he, "where the
&s;ignor has a fine man&s;ion, and from thence
to his e&s;tate in Tu&s;cany. Why do you
look &s;o grave, child?&mdash;You, who are &s;o fond
of a romantic country and fine views, will
doubtle&s;s be delighted with this journey."</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="396">
"Am I then to be of the party, ma|dam?"
&s;aid Emily, with extreme &s;urpri&s;e
and emotion. "Mo&s;t certainly," replied
her aunt, "how could you imagine we
&s;hould leave you behind? But I &s;ee you are
thinking of the Chevalier; he is not yet, I
believe, informed of the journey, but he very
&s;oon will be &s;o. Signor Montoni is gone to
acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey,
and to &s;ay, that the propo&s;ed connection be|tween
the families mu&s;t from this time be
thought of no more."</P>
<P>The unfeeling manner, in which Madame
Montoni thus informed her niece, that &s;he
mu&s;t be &s;eparated, perhaps for ever, from
the man, with whom &s;he was on the point of
being united for life, added to the di&s;may,
which &s;he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have &s;uffered at
&s;uch intelligence. When &s;he could &s;peak
&s;he a&s;ked the cau&s;e of the &s;udden change in
Madame's &s;entiments towards Valancourt,
but the only reply &s;he could obtain was,
that the Signor had forbade the connection,
<PB N="385" REF="397">
con&s;idering it to be greatly inferior to what
Emily might rea&s;onably expect.</P>
<P>"I now leave the affair entirely to the Sig|nor,"
added Madame Montoni, "but I mu&s;t
&s;ay, that M. Valancourt never was a favourite
with me, and I was overper&s;uaded, or I
&s;hould not have given my con&s;ent to the
connection. I was weak enough&mdash;I am &s;o
fooli&s;h &s;ometimes!&mdash;to &s;uffer other people's
unea&s;ine&s;s to affect me, and &s;o my better
judgment yielded to your affliction. But
the Signor has very properly pointed out
the folly of this, and he &s;hall not have to
reprove me a &s;econd time. I am determined,
that you &s;hall &s;ubmit to tho&s;e, who know
how to guide you better than your&s;elf&mdash;I am
determined, that you &s;hall be conformable."</P>
<P>Emily would have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the
a&s;&s;ertions of this eloquent &s;peech, had not
her mind been &s;o overwhelmed by the &s;ud|den
&s;hock it had received, that &s;he &s;carcely
heard a word of what was latterly addre&s;&s;ed
to her. Whatever were the weakne&s;&s;es of
Madame Montoni, &s;he might have avoided
<PB N="386" REF="398">
to accu&s;e her&s;elf with tho&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion
and tenderne&s;s to the feelings of others, and
e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of Emily. It was the
&s;ame ambition, that lately prevailed upon
her to &s;olicit an alliance with Madame
Clairval's family, which induced her to
withdraw from it, now that her marriage
with Montoni had exalted her &s;elf-con|&s;equence,
and, with it, her views for her
niece.</P>
<P>Emily was, at this time, too much affec|ted
to employ either remon&s;trance, or en|treaty
on this topic; and when, at length,
&s;he attempted the latter, her emotion over|came
her &s;peech, and &s;he retired to her apart|ment,
to think, if in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her
mind to think was po&s;&s;ible, upon this &s;ud|den
and overwhelming &s;ubject. It was very
long, before her &s;pirits were &s;ufficiently com|po&s;ed
to permit the reflection, which, when
it came, was dark and even terrible. She
&s;aw, that Montoni sought to aggrandi&s;e him|&s;elf
in his di&s;po&s;al of her, and it occurred,
that his friend Cavigni was the per&s;on, for
<PB N="387" REF="399">
whom he was intere&s;ted. The pro&s;pect of
going to Italy was &s;till rendered darker,
when &s;he con&s;idered the tumultuous &s;itua|tion
of that country, then torn by civil com|motion,
where every petty &s;tate was at war
with its neighbour, and even every ca&s;tle
liable to the attack of an invader. She con&s;i|dered
the per&s;on, to who&s;e immediate guid|ance
&s;he would be committed, and the va&s;t
di&s;tance, that was to &s;eparate her from Valan|court,
and, at the recollection of him, every
other image vani&s;hed from her mind, and
every thought was again ob&s;cured by grief.</P>
<P>In this perturbed &s;tate &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome
hours, and, when &s;he was &s;ummoned to din|ner,
&s;he entreated permi&s;&s;ion to remain
in her own apartment; but Madame Mon|toni
was alone, and the reque&s;t was refu&s;ed.
Emily and her aunt &s;aid little during the
repa&s;t; the one occupied by her griefs, the
otherengro&s;&s;ed by the di&s;appointment, which
the unexpected ab&s;ence of Montoni occa|&s;ioned;
for not only was her vanity piqued
by the neglect, but her jealou&s;y alarmed by
<PB N="388" REF="400">
what &s;he con&s;idered as a my&s;terious engage|ment.
When the cloth was drawn and they
were alone, Emily renewed the mention of
Valancourt; but her aunt, neither &s;oftened
to pity, or awakened to remor&s;e, became
enraged, that her will &s;hould be oppo&s;ed,
and the authority of Montoni que&s;tioned,
though this was done by Emily with her
u&s;ual gentlene&s;s, who, after a long, and tor|turing
conver&s;ation, retired in tears.</P>
<P>As &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the hall, a per&s;on entered
it by the great door, whom, as her eyes
ha&s;tily glanced that way, &s;he imagined to be
Montoni, and &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing on with quicker
&s;teps, when &s;he heard the well-known voice
of Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Emily, O! my Emily!" cried he in a tone
faltering with impatience, while &s;he turned,
and, as he advanced, was alarmed at the
expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance and the eager
de&s;peration of his air. "In tears, Emily!
I would &s;peak with you," &s;aid he, "I
have much to &s;ay; conduct me where we
<PB N="389" REF="401">
may conver&s;e. But you tremble&mdash;you are
ill! Let me lead you to a &s;eat."</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved the open door of an apart|ment,
and ha&s;tily took her hand to lead
her thither; but &s;he attempted to withdraw
it, and &s;aid, with a languid &s;mile, "I am
better already; if you wi&s;h to &s;ee my aunt
&s;he is in the dining-parlour." "I mu&s;t
&s;peak with <HI>you,</HI> my Emily," replied Valan|court,
"Good God! is it already come to
this? Are you indeed &s;o willing to re&s;ign
me? But this is an improper place&mdash;I am
overheard. Let me entreat your attention,
if only for a few minutes." "When you
have &s;een my aunt," &s;aid Emily. "I was
wretched enough when I came hither," ex|claimed
Valancourt, "do not increa&s;e my
mi&s;ery by this coldne&s;s&mdash;this cruel refu|&s;al."</P>
<P>The de&s;pondency, with which he &s;poke
this, affected her almo&s;t to tears, but &s;he
per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to hear him, till he had
conver&s;ed with Madame Montoni. "Where
is her hu&s;band, where, then, is Montoni?"
<PB N="390" REF="402">
&s;aid Valancourt, in an altered tone, "it is
he, to whom I mu&s;t &s;peak."</P>
<P>Emily, terrified for the con&s;equence of
the indignation, that fla&s;hed in his eyes,
tremblingly a&s;&s;ured him, that Montoni was
at home, and entreated he would endeavour
to moderate his re&s;entment. At the tremu|lous
accents of her voice, his eyes &s;oftened
in&s;tantly from wildne&s;s into tenderne&s;s.
"You are ill, Emily," &s;aid he, "they will
de&s;troy us both! Forgive me, that I dared
to doubt your affection."</P>
<P>Emily no longer oppo&s;ed him, as he led
her into an adjoining parlour; the manner,
in which he had named Montoni, had &s;o
much alarmed, her for his own &s;afety, that
&s;he was now only anxious to "prevent the con|&s;equences
of his ju&s;t re&s;entment. He li&s;tened
to her entreaties, with attention, but replied
to them only with looks of despondency and
tenderne&s;s, concealing, as much as po&s;&s;ible,
the &s;entiments he felt toward Morrtoni, that
he might &s;ooth the apprehen&s;ions, which di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
her. But &s;he &s;aw the veil he had
<PB N="391" REF="403">
&s;pread over his re&s;entment, and, his a&s;&s;umed
tranquillity only alarming her more, &s;he
urged, at length, the impolicy of forcing
an interview with Montoni, and of taking
any mea&s;ure, which might render their &s;epa|ration
irremediable. Valancourt yielded
to the&s;e remon&s;trances, and her affecting
entreaties drew from him a promi&s;e, that,
however Montoni might per&s;i&s;t in his de&s;ign
of di&s;uniting them, he would not &s;eek to
redre&s;s his wrongs by violence. "For my
&s;ake," &s;aid Emily, "let the con&s;ideration
of what I &s;hould &s;uffer deter you from &s;uch
a mode of revenge!" "For your &s;ake,
Emily," replied Valancourt, his eyes filling
with tears of tenderne&s;s and grief, while he
gazed upon her. "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I &s;hall &s;ub|due
my&s;elf. But, though I have given you
my &s;olemn promi&s;e to do this, do not expect,
that I can tamely &s;ubmit to the authority or
Montoni; if I could, I &s;hould be unworthy
of you. Yet, O Emily! how long may
he condemn me to live without you,&mdash;
<PB N="392" REF="404">
how long may it be before you return to
France!"</P>
<P>Emily endeavoured to &s;ooth him with
a&s;&s;urances of her unalterable affection, and by
repre&s;enting, that, in little more than a year,
&s;he &s;hould be her own mi&s;tre&s;s, as far as re|lated
to her aunt, from who&s;e guardian&s;hip
her age would then relea&s;e her; a&s;&s;urances,
which gave little con&s;olation to Valancourt,
who con&s;idered, that &s;he would then be in
Italy and in the power of tho&s;e, who&s;e
dominion over her would not cea&s;e with
their rights; but he affected to be con&s;oled
by them. Emily, comforted by the promi&s;e
&s;he had obtained, and by his apparent com|po&s;ure,
was about to leave him, when her
aunt entered the room. She threw a glance
of &s;harp reproof upon her niece; who im|mediately
withdrew, and of haughty di&s;|plea&s;ure
upon Valancourt.</P>
<P>"This is not the conduct I &s;hould have
expected from you, &s;ir;" &s;aid &s;he, "I did
not expect to &s;ee you in my hou&s;e, after
you had been informed, that your vi&s;its
<PB N="393" REF="405">
were no longer agreeable, much le&s;s, that
you would &s;eek a clande&s;tine interview with
my niece, and that &s;he would grant one."</P>
<P>Valancourt, perceiving it nece&s;&s;ary to vin|dicate
Emily from &s;uch a de&s;ign, explained,
that the purpo&s;e of his own vi&s;it had been
to reque&s;t an interview with Montoni, and
he then entered upon the &s;ubject of it, with
the tempered &s;pirit which the &s;ex, rather
than the re&s;pectability, of Madame Mon|toni,
demanded.</P>
<P>His expo&s;tulations were an&s;wered with
&s;evere rebuke &s;he lamented again, that her
prudence had ever yielded to what &s;he termed
compa&s;&s;ion, and added, that &s;he was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible
of the folly of her former con&s;ent, that,
to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of a repetition, &s;he
had committed the affair entirely to the con|duct
of Signor Montoni.</P>
<P>The feeling eloquence of Valancourt, how|ever,
at length, made her &s;en&s;ible in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
of her unworthy conduct, and &s;he became
&s;u&s;ceptible to &s;hame, but not to remor&s;e: &s;he
hated Valancourt, who awakened her to this
painful &s;en&s;ation, and, in proportion as &s;he
<PB N="394" REF="406">
grew di&s;&s;atisfied with her&s;elf, her abhorrence
of him increa&s;ed. This was al&s;o the more
inveterate, becau&s;e his tempered words and
manner were &s;uch as, without accu&s;ing her,
compelled her to accu&s;e her&s;elf, and neither
left her a hope, that the odious portrait was
the caricature of his prejudice, or afforded
her an excu&s;e for expre&s;&s;ing the violent re|&s;entment,
with which &s;he contemplated it.
At length, her anger ro&s;e to &s;uch an height,
that Valancourt was compelled to leave the
hou&s;e abruptly, le&s;t he &s;hould forfeit his
own e&s;teem by an intemperate reply. He
was then convinced, that from Madame
Montoni he had nothing to hope, for what of
either pity, or ju&s;tice could be expected from
a per&s;on, who could feel the pain of guilt,
without the humility of repentance?</P>
<P>To Montoni he looked with equal de|&s;pondency,
&s;ince it was nearly evident, that
this plan of &s;eparation originated with him,
and it was not probable, that he would re|linqui&s;h
his own views to entreaties, or re|mon&s;trances,
which he mu&s;t have fore&s;een
<PB N="395" REF="407">
and have been prepared to re&s;i&s;t. Yet,
remembering his promi&s;e to Emily, and
more &s;olicitous, concerning his love, than
jealous of his con&s;equence, Valancourt was
careful to do nothing that might unnece&s;|&s;arily
irritate Montoni; he wrote to him,
therefore, not to demand an interview, but
to &s;olicit one, and, having done this, he
endeavoured to await with calmne&s;s his re|ply.</P>
<P>Madame Clairval was pa&s;&s;ive in the af|fair.
When &s;he gave her approbation to
Valancourt's marriage, it was in the belief,
that Emily would be the heire&s;s of Madame
Montoni's fortune, and, though, upon the
nuptials of the latter, when &s;he perceived the
fallacy of this expectation, her con&s;cience
had withheld her from adopting any mea|&s;ure
to prevent the union, her benevolence
was not &s;ufficiently active to impel her to|wards
any &s;tep, that might now promote it.
She was, on the contrary, &s;ecretly plea&s;ed,
that Valancourt was relea&s;ed from an en|gagement,
which &s;he con&s;idered to be as in|ferior,
<PB N="396" REF="408">
in point of fortune, to his merit, as
his alliance was thought by Montoni to be
humiliating to the beauty of Emily; and,
though her pride was wounded by this re|jection
of a member of her family, &s;he di&s;|dained
to &s;hew re&s;entment otherwi&s;e, than
by &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Montoni, in his reply to Valancourt,
&s;aid, that as an interview could neither re|move
the objections of the one, or overcome
the wi&s;hes of the other, it would &s;erve only
to produce u&s;ele&s;s altercation between them.
He, therefore, thought proper to refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of the policy, &s;ugge&s;ted
by Emily, and of his promi&s;e to her, Valan|court
re&s;trained the impul&s;e, that urged
him to the hou&s;e of Montoni, to demand
what had been denied to his entreaties.
He only repeated his &s;olicitations to &s;ee
him; &s;econding them with all the argu|ments
his &s;ituation could &s;ugge&s;t. Thus
&s;everal days pa&s;&s;ed, in remon&s;trance, on one
&s;ide, and inflexible denial, on the other;
for, whether it was fear, or &s;hame, or the
<PB N="397" REF="409">
hatred, which re&s;ults from both, that made
Montoni &s;hun the man he had injured, he
was peremptory in his refu&s;al, and was
neither &s;oftened to pity by the agony, which
Valancourt's letters pourtrayed, or awakened
to a repentance of his own inju&s;tice by the
&s;trong remon&s;trances he employed. At length,
Valancourt's letters were returned unopened,
and then, in the fir&s;t moments of pa&s;&s;ionate
de&s;pair, he forgot every promi&s;e to Emily,
except the &s;olemn one, which bound him to
avoid violence, and ha&s;tened to Montoni's
chateau, determined to &s;ee him by whatever
other means might be nece&s;&s;ary. Montoni
was denied, and Valancourt, when he after|wards
enquired for Madame, and Ma'am|&s;elle
St. Aubert, was ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed ad|mittance
by the &s;ervants. Not choo&s;ing to
&s;ubmit him&s;elf to a conte&s;t with the&s;e, he,
at length, departed, and, returning home in
a &s;tate of mind approaching to frenzy,
wrote to Emily of what had pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;|&s;ed
without restraint all the agony of his
heart, and entreated, that, &s;ince he mu&s;t not
<PB N="398" REF="410">
otherwi&s;e hope to &s;ee her immediately, &s;he
would allow him an interview unknown to
Montoni. Soon after he had di&s;patched this,
his pa&s;&s;ions becoming more temperate, he
was &s;en&s;ible of the error he had committed
in having given Emily new &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s
in the &s;trong mention of his own &s;uffering,
and would have given half the world, had
it been his, to recover the letter. Emily,
however, was &s;pared the pain &s;he mu&s;t have
received from it by the &s;u&s;picious policy of
Madame Montoni, who had ordered, that
all letters, addre&s;&s;ed to her niece, &s;hould be
delivered to her&s;elf, and who, after having
peru&s;ed this and indulged the expre&s;&s;ions of
re&s;entment, which Valancourt's mention of
Montoni provoked, had con&s;igned it to the
flames.</P>
<P>Montoni, meanwhile, every day more
impatient to leave France, gave repeated
orders for di&s;patch to the &s;ervants employed
in preparations for the journey, and to the
per&s;ons, with whom he was tran&s;acting &s;ome
particular bu&s;ine&s;s. He pre&s;erved a &s;teady
<PB N="399" REF="411">
&s;ilence to the letters in which Valancourt,
de&s;pairing of greater good, and having &s;ub|dued
the pa&s;&s;ion, that had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed
again&s;t his policy, &s;olicited only the indul|gence
of being allowed to bid Emily fare|well.
But, when the latter learned, that &s;he
was really to &s;et out in a very few days,
and that it was de&s;igned he &s;hould &s;ee her
no more, forgetting every con&s;ideration of
prudence, he dared, in a &s;econd letter to
Emily, to propo&s;e a clande&s;tine marriage.
This al&s;o was tran&s;mitted to Madame Mon|toni,
and the la&s;t day of Emily's &s;tay at
Tholou&s;e arrived, without affording Valan|court
even a line to &s;ooth his &s;ufferings, or
a hope, that he &s;hould be allowed a parting
interview.</P>
<P>During this period of torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e
to Valancourt, Emily was &s;unk into that
kind of &s;tupor, with which &s;udden and
irremediable misfortune &s;ometimes over|whelms
the mind. Loving him with the
tendere&s;t affection, and having long been
accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider him as the friend
<PB N="400" REF="412">
and companion of all her future days, &s;he
had no ideas of happine&s;s, that were not con|nected
with him. What, then, mu&s;t have
been her &s;uffering, when thus &s;uddenly they
were to be &s;eparated, perhaps, for ever, cer|tainly
to be thrown into di&s;tant parts of the
world, where they could &s;carcely hear of
each other's exi&s;tence; and all this in obe|dience
to the will of a &s;tranger, for &s;uch
was Montoni, and of a per&s;on, who had
but lately been anxious to ha&s;ten their nup|tials!
It was in vain, that &s;he endeavoured
to &s;ubdue her grief, and re&s;ign her&s;elf to
an event, which &s;he could not avoid. The
&s;ilence of Valancourt afflicted more than
it &s;urpri&s;ed her, &s;ince &s;he attributed it to its
ju&s;t occa&s;ion; but, when the day, preceding
that, on which &s;he was to quit Tholou&s;e,
arrived, and &s;he heard no mention of his
being permitted to take leave of her, grief
overcame every con&s;ideration, that had made
her reluctant to &s;peak of him, and &s;he en|quired
of Madame Montoni, whether this
con&s;olation had been refu&s;ed. Her aunt
<PB N="401" REF="413">
informed her that it had, adding, that, after
the provocation &s;he had her&s;elf received from
Valancourt, in their la&s;t interview, and the
per&s;ecution, which the Signor had &s;uffered
from his letters, no entreaties &s;hould avail
to procure it.</P>
<P>"If the Chevalier expected this favour
from us," &s;aid &s;he, "he &s;hould have con|ducted
him&s;elf in a very different manner;
he &s;hould have waited patiently, till he knew
whether we were di&s;po&s;ed to grant it, and
not have come and reproved me, becau&s;e
I did not think proper to be&s;tow my niece
upon him,&mdash;and then have per&s;i&s;ted in
troubling the Signor, becau&s;e he did not
think proper to enter into any di&s;pute
about &s;o childi&s;h an affair. His behaviour
throughout has been extremely pre&s;ump|tuous
and impertinent, and I de&s;ire, that I
may never hear his name repeated, and
that you will get the better of tho&s;e fooli&s;h
&s;orrows and whims, and look like other peo|ple,
and not appear with that di&s;mal coun|tenance,
as if you were ready to cry. For,
<PB N="402" REF="414">
though you &s;ay nothing, you cannot conceal
your grief from my penetration. I can &s;ee
you are ready to cry at this moment, though
I am reproving you for it; aye, even now,
in &s;pite of my commands."</P>
<P>Emily, having turned away to hide her
tears, quitted the room to indulge them,
and the day was pa&s;&s;ed in an inten&s;ity of an|gui&s;h,
&s;uch as &s;he had, perhaps, never
known before. When &s;he withdrew to
her chamber for the night, &s;he remained in
the chair where &s;he had placed her&s;elf, on
entering the room, ab&s;orbed in her grief,
till long after every member of the family,
except her&s;elf, was retired to re&s;t. She
could not dive&s;t her&s;elf of a belief, that &s;he
had parted with Valancourt to meet no
more; a belief, which did not ari&s;e merely
from fore&s;een circum&s;tances, for, though
the length of the journey &s;he was about to
commence, the uncertainty as to the period
of her return, together with the prohibitions
&s;he had received, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify it, &s;he
yielded al&s;o to an impre&s;&s;ion, which &s;he mi&s;|took
<PB N="403" REF="415">
for a pre-&s;entiment, that &s;he was going
from Valancourt for ever. How dreadful
to her imagination, too, was the di&s;tance
that would &s;eparate them&mdash;the Alps, tho&s;e
tremendous barriers! would ri&s;e, and whole
countries extend between the regions where
each mu&s;t exi&s;t! To live in adjoining pro|vinces,
to live even in the &s;ame country,
though without &s;eeing him, was compara|tive
happine&s;s to the conviction of this
dreadful length of di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Her mind was, at length, &s;o much agi|tated
by the con&s;ideration of her &s;tate, and
the belief, that &s;he had &s;een Valancourt for
the la&s;t time, that &s;he &s;uddenly became very
faint, and, looking round the chamber for
&s;omething, that might revive her, &s;he ob|&s;erved
the ca&s;ements, and had ju&s;t &s;trength
to throw one open, near which &s;he &s;eated
her&s;elf. The air recalled her &s;pirits, and
the &s;till moon-light, that fell upon the elms
of a long avenue, fronting the window,
&s;omewhat &s;oothed them, and determined
her to try whether exerci&s;e and the open air
<PB N="404" REF="416">
would not relieve the inten&s;e pain that
bound her temples. In the chateau all was
&s;till; and, pa&s;&s;ing down the great &s;tair-ca&s;e
into the hall, from whence a pa&s;&s;age led im|mediately
to the garden, &s;he &s;o&s;tly and un|heard,
as &s;he thought, unlocked the door,
and entered the avenue. Emily pa&s;&s;ed on
with &s;teps now hurried, and now faltering,
as, deceived by the &s;hadows among the trees,
&s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;ome per&s;on move in
the di&s;tant per&s;pective, and feared, that it
was a &s;py of Madame Montoni. Her de&s;ire,
however, to re-vi&s;it the pavilion, where &s;he
had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many happy hours with Valan|court,
and had admired with him the exten|&s;ive
pro&s;pect over Languedoc and her na|tive
Ga&s;cony, overcame her apprehen&s;ion
of being ob&s;erved, and &s;he moved on to|wards
the terrace, which, running along
the upper garden, commanded the whole of
the lower one, and communicated with it
by a flight of marble &s;teps, that terminated
the avenue.</P>
<P>Having reached the&s;e &s;teps, &s;he pau&s;ed a
<PB N="405" REF="417">
moment to look round, for her di&s;tance
from the chateau now increa&s;ed the fear,
which the &s;tillne&s;s and ob&s;curity of the
hour had awakened. But, perceiving no|thing
that could ju&s;tify it, &s;he a&s;cended to
the terrace, where the moon-light &s;hewed
the long broad walk, with the pavilion at
its extremity, while the rays &s;ilvered the fo|liage
of the high trees and &s;hrubs, that bor|dered
it on the right, and the tufted &s;um|mits
of tho&s;e, that ro&s;e to a level with the
balu&s;trade on the left, from the garden
below. Her di&s;tance from the chateau
again alarming her, &s;he pau&s;ed to li&s;ten; the
night was &s;o calm, that no &s;ound could
have e&s;caped her, but &s;he heard only the
plaintive &s;weetne&s;s of the nightingale, with
the light &s;hiver of the leaves, and &s;he pur|&s;ued
her way towards the pavilion, having
reached which, its ob&s;curity did not prevent
the emotion, that a fuller view of its well|known
&s;cene would have excited. The
lattices were thrown back, and &s;hewed be|yond
their embowered arch the moon-light
<PB N="406" REF="418">
land&s;cape, &s;hadowy and &s;oft; its groves,
and plains extending gradually and indi&s;|tinctly
to the eye, its di&s;tant mountains
catching a &s;tronger gleam, and the nearer
river reflecting the moon, and trembling to
her rays.</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he approached the lattice,
was &s;en&s;ible of the features of this &s;cene
only as they &s;erved to bring Valancourt
more immediately to her fancy. "Ah!"
&s;aid &s;he, with a heavy &s;igh, as &s;he threw her|&s;elf
into a chair by the window, "how of|ten
have we &s;at together in this &s;pot&mdash;often
have looked upon that land&s;cape! Never,
never more &s;hall we view it together&mdash;never&mdash;never
more, perhaps, &s;hall we look upon
each other!"</P>
<P>Her tears were &s;uddenly &s;topped by ter|ror&mdash;a
voice &s;poke near her in the pavilion;
&s;he &s;hrieked&mdash;it &s;poke again, and &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the well known tones of Valan|court.
It was indeed Valancourt who &s;up|ported
her in his arms! For &s;ome moments
their emotion would not &s;uffer either to
<PB N="407" REF="419">
&s;peak. "Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt at
length, as he pre&s;&s;ed her hand in his,
"Emily!" and he was again &s;ilent, but the
accent, in which he had pronounced her
name, expre&s;&s;ed all his tenderne&s;s and &s;or|row.</P>
<P>"O my Emily!" he re&s;umed, after a
long pau&s;e, "I do then &s;ee you once again,
and hear again the &s;ound of that voice! I
have haunted this place&mdash;the&s;e gardens, for
many&mdash;many nights, with a faint, very
faint hope of &s;eeing you. This was the
only chance that remained for me, and,
thank heaven! it has at length &s;ucceeded&mdash;I
am not condemned to ab&s;olute de&s;pair!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;aid &s;omething, &s;he &s;carcely knew
what, expre&s;&s;ive of her unalterable affec|tion,
and endeavoured to-calm the agitation
of his mind; but Valancourt could for
&s;ome time only utter incoherent expre&s;&s;ions
of his emotions; and, when he was &s;ome|what
more compo&s;ed, he &s;aid, "I came hi|ther,
&s;oon after &s;un-&s;et, and have been
watching in the gardens, and in this pavi|lion
<PB N="408" REF="420">
ever &s;ince; for, though I had now gi|ven
up all hope of &s;eeing you, I could not
re&s;olve to tear my&s;elf from a place &s;o near to
you, and &s;hould probably have lingered
about the chateau till morning dawned.
O how heavily the moments have pa&s;&s;ed,
yet with what various emotion have they
been marked, as I &s;ometimes thought I
heard foot&s;teps, and fancied you were ap|proaching,
and then again&mdash;perceived only
a dead and dreary &s;ilence! But, when you
opened the door of the pavilion, and the
darkne&s;s prevented my di&s;tingui&s;hing with
certainty, whether it was ray love&mdash;my
heart beat &s;o &s;trongly with hopes and fears,
that I could not &s;peak. The in&s;tant I
heard the plaintive accents of your voice,
my doubts vani&s;hed, but not my fears, till
you &s;poke of me; then, lo&s;ing the appre|hen&s;ion
of alarming you in the exce&s; of
my emotion, I could no longer be &s;ilent.
O Emily! the&s;e are moments, in which
joy and grief &s;truggle &s;o powerfully for
<PB N="409" REF="421">
pre-eminence, that the heart can &s;carcely
&s;upport the conte&s;t!"</P>
<P>Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of
this a&s;&s;ertion, but the joy &s;he felt on thus
meeting Valancourt, at the very moment
when &s;he was lamenting, that they mu&s;t
probably meet no more, &s;oon melted into
grief, as reflection &s;tole over her thoughts,
and imagination prompted vi&s;ions of the
future. She &s;truggled to recover the calm
dignity of mind, which was nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;upport her through this la&s;t interview, and
which Valancourt found it utterly impo&s;&s;ible
to attain, for the tran&s;ports of his joy
changed abruptly into tho&s;e of &s;uffering,
and he expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned
language his horror of this &s;eparation, and
his de&s;pair of their ever meeting again.
Emily wept &s;ilently as &s;he li&s;tened to him,
and then, trying to command her own di&s;|tre&s;s,
and to &s;ooth his, &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted every
circum&s;tance that could lead to hope. But
the energy of his fears led him in&s;tantly to
detect the friendly fallacies, which &s;he endea|voured
<PB N="410" REF="422">
to impo&s;e on her&s;elf and him, and
al&s;o to conjure up illu&s;ions too powerful
for his rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"You are going from me," &s;aid he, "to
a di&s;tant country, O how di&s;tant!&mdash;to new
&s;ociety, new friends, new admirers, with
people too, who will try to make you forget
me, and to promote new connections! How
can I know this, and not know, that you
will never return for me&mdash;never can be
mine." His voice was &s;tifled by &s;ighs.</P>
<P>"You believe, then," &s;aid Emily, "that
the pangs I &s;uffer proceed from a trivial
and temporary intere&s;t; you believe&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Suffer!" interrupted Valancourt, "&s;uf|fer
for me! O Emily&mdash;how &s;weet&mdash;how
bitter are tho&s;e words; what comfort, what
angui&s;h do they give! I ought not to doubt
the &s;teadine&s;s of your affection, yet &s;uch is
the incon&s;i&s;tency of real love, that it is always
awake to &s;u&s;picion, however unrea&s;onable;
always requiring new a&s;&s;urances from the ob|ject
of its intere&s;t, and thus it is, that I always
feel revived, as by a new conviction, when
<PB N="411" REF="423">
your words tell me I am dear to you; and,
wanting the&s;e, I relap&s;e into doubt, and too
often into de&s;pondency. "Then &s;eeming to
recollect him|&s;elf, he exclaimed, "But what
a wretch am I, thus to torture you, and in
the&s;e moments, too! I, who ought to &s;up|port
and comfort you!"</P>
<P>This reflection overcame Valancourt with
tenderne&s;s, but, relap&s;ing into de&s;pondency,
he again felt only for him&s;elf, and lamented
again this cruel &s;eparation, in a voice and
words &s;o impa&s;&s;ioned, that Emily, could no
longer &s;truggle to repre&s;s her own grief, or
to &s;ooth his. Valancourt, between the&s;e
emotions of love and pity, lo&s;t the power,
and almo&s;t the wi&s;h, of repre&s;&s;ing his agi|tation;
and, in the intervals of convul&s;ive
&s;obs, he, at one moment, ki&s;&s;ed away her
tears, then told her cruelly, that po&s;&s;ibly &s;he
might never again weep for him, and then
tried to &s;peak more calmly, but only ex|claimed,
"O Emily&mdash;my heart will break!&mdash;I
cannot&mdash;cannot leave you! Now&mdash;I
gaze upon that countenance, now I hold
<PB N="412" REF="424">
you in my arms! a little while, and all this
will appear a dream. I &s;hall look, and can|not
&s;ee you; &s;hall try to recollect your fea|tures&mdash;and
the impre&s;&s;ion will be fled from
my imagination;&mdash;to hear the tones of your
voice, and even memory will be &s;ilent!&mdash;I
cannot, cannot leave you! Why &s;hould
we confide the happine&s;s of our whole lives
to the will of people, who have no right
to interrupt, and, except in giving you to
me, have no power to promote it? O
Emily! venture to tru&s;t your own heart,
venture to be mine forever!" His voice
trembled, and he was &s;ilent; Emily conti|nued
to weep, and was &s;ilent al&s;o, when
Valancourt proceeded to propo&s;e an imme|diate
marriage, and that, at an early hour
on the following morning, &s;he &s;hould quit
Madame Montoni's hou&s;e, and be con|ducted
by him to the church of the Au|gu&s;tines,
where a friar &s;hould await to
unite them.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence, with which &s;he li&s;tened to a
propo&s;al, dictated by love and de&s;pair, and
<PB N="413" REF="425">
enforced at a moment, when it &s;eemed
&s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for her to oppo&s;e it;&mdash;when
her heart was &s;oftened by the &s;orrows
of a &s;eparation, that might be eternal, and
her rea&s;on ob&s;cured by the illu&s;ions of love
and terror, encouraged him to hope, that
it would not be rejected. "Speak, my
Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt eagerly, "let me
hear your voice, let me hear you confirm
my fate." She &s;poke not; her cheek was
cold, and her &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to fail her, but
&s;he did not faint. To Valancourt's terri|fied
imagination &s;he appeared to be dying;
he called upon her name, ro&s;e to go to the
chateau for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and then, recollect|ing
her &s;ituation, feared to go, or to leave
her for a moment.</P>
<P>After a few minutes, &s;he drew a deep
&s;igh, and began to revive. The conflict
&s;he had &s;uffered, between love and the duty
&s;he at pre&s;ent owed to her father's &s;i&s;ter;
her repugnance to a clande&s;tine marriage, her
fear of emerging on the world with embar|ra&s;&s;ments,
&s;uch as might ultimately involve
<PB N="414" REF="426">
the object of her affection in mi&s;ery and re|pentance;&mdash;all
this various intere&s;t was too
powerful for a mind, already enervated by
&s;orrow, and her rea&s;on had &s;uffered a tran|&s;ient
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion. But duty, and good &s;en&s;e,
however hard the conflict, at length, tri|umphed
over affection and mournful pre|&s;entiment;
above all, &s;he dreaded to in|volve
Valancourt in ob&s;curity and vain
regret, which &s;he &s;aw, or thought &s;he &s;aw,
mu&s;t be the too certain con&s;equence of a
marriage in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; and
&s;he acted, perhaps, with &s;omewhat more than
female fortitude, when &s;he re&s;olved to endure
a pre&s;ent, rather than provoke a di&s;tant
misfortune.</P>
<P>With a candour, that proved how truly
&s;he e&s;teemed and loved him, and which en|deared
her to him, if po&s;&s;ible, more than
ever, &s;he told Valancourt all her rea&s;ons for
rejecting his propo&s;als. Tho&s;e, which in|fluenced
her concerning his future welfare,
he in&s;tantly re&s;uted, or rather contradicted;
but they awakened tender con&s;iderations
for her, which the frenzy of pa&s;&s;ion and
<PB N="415" REF="427">
de&s;pair had concealed before, and love,
which had but lately prompted him to pro|po&s;e
a clande&s;tine and immediate marriage,
now induced him to renounce it. The
triumph was almo&s;t too much for his heart;
for Emily's &s;ake, he endeavoured to &s;tifle
his grief, but the &s;welling angui&s;h would
not be re&s;trained. "O Emily!" &s;aid he,
"I mu&s;t leave you&mdash;I <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> leave you, and
I know it is for ever."</P>
<P>Convul&s;ive &s;obs again interrupted his
words, and they wept together in &s;ilence,
till Emily, recollecting the danger of being
di&s;covered, and the impropriety of pro|longing
an interview, which might &s;ubject
her to cen&s;ure, &s;ummoned all her fortitude
to utter a la&s;t farewell.</P>
<P>"Stay!" &s;aid Valancourt, "I conjure you
&s;tay, for I have much to tell you. The
agitation of my mind has hitherto &s;uffered
me to &s;peak only on the &s;ubject that occu|pied
it;&mdash;I have forborne to mention a doubt
of much importance, partly, le&s;t it &s;hould
appear as if I told it with an ungenerous
<PB N="416" REF="428">
view of alarming you into a compliance
with my late propo&s;al."</P>
<P>Emily, much agitated, did not leave Va|lancourt,
but &s;he led him from the pavi|lion,
and, as they walked upon the terrace,
he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>"This Montoni: I have heard &s;ome
&s;trange hints concerning him. Are you
certain he is of Madame Que&s;nel's family,
and that his fortune is what it appears to
be?"</P>
<P>"I have no rea&s;on to doubt either," re|plied
Emily, in a voice of alarm. "Of the
fir&s;t, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have no
certain means of judging of the latter, and
I entreat you will tell me all you have
heard."</P>
<P>"That I certainly will, but it is very im|perfect,
and un&s;atisfacotory information. I
gathered it by accident from an Italian,
who was &s;peaking to another per&s;on of this
Montoni. They were talking of his mar|riage;
the Italian &s;aid, that if he was the
per&s;on he meant, he was not likely to make
<PB N="417" REF="429">
Madame Cheron happy. He proceeded to
&s;peak of him in general terms of di&s;like,
and then gave &s;ome particular hints, con|cerning
his character, that excited my curi|o&s;ity,
and I ventured to a&s;k him a few que&s;|tions.
He was re&s;erved in his replies,
but, after he&s;itating for &s;ome time, he
owned, that he had under&s;tood abroad, that
Montoni was a man of de&s;perate fortune
and character. He &s;aid &s;omething of a
ca&s;tle of Montoni's, &s;ituated among the
Apennines, and of &s;ome &s;trange circum|&s;tances,
that might be mentioned, as to his
former mode of life. I pre&s;&s;ed him to in|form
me further, but I believe the &s;trong
intere&s;t I felt was vi&s;ible in my manner,
and alarmed him; for no entreaties could
prevail with him to give any explanation of
the circum&s;tances he had alluded to, or to
mention any thing further concerning Mon|toni.
I ob&s;erved to him, that, if Montoni
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ca&s;tle in the Apennines,
it appeared from &s;uch a circum&s;tance, that
he was of &s;ome family, and al&s;o &s;eemed to
<PB N="418" REF="430">
contradict the report, that he was a man of
entirely broken fortunes. He &s;hook his
head, and looked as if he could have &s;aid a
great deal, but made no reply.</P>
<P>"A hope of learning &s;omething more &s;a|tisfactory,
or more po&s;itive, detained me in
his company a con&s;iderable time, and I re|newed
the &s;ubject repeatedly, but the Italian
wrapped him&s;elf up in re&s;erve, &s;aid&mdash;that
what he had mentioned he had caught only
from a floating report, and that reports fre|quently
aro&s;e from per&s;onal malice, and
were very little to be depended upon. I
forbore to pre&s;s the &s;ubject farther, &s;ince it
was obvious that he was alarmed for the
con&s;equence of what he had already &s;aid,
and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty
on a point where &s;u&s;pen&s;e is almo&s;t intole|rable.
Think, Emily, what I mu&s;t &s;uffer
to &s;ee you depart for a foreign country,
committed to the power of a man of &s;uch
doubtful character as is this Montoni! But
I will not alarm you unnece&s;&s;arily;&mdash;it is
po&s;&s;ible, as the Italian &s;aid, at fir&s;t, that
<PB N="419" REF="431">
this is not the Montoni he alluded to. Yet,
Emily, con&s;ider well before you re&s;olve to
commit your&s;elf to him. O! I mu&s;t not
tru&s;t my&s;elf to &s;peak&mdash;or I &s;hall renounce
all the motives, which &s;o lately influenced
me to re&s;ign the hope of your becoming
mine immediately."</P>
<P>Valancourt walked upon the terrace with
hurried &s;teps, while Emily remained lean|ing
on the balu&s;trade in deep thought.
The information &s;he had ju&s;t received ex|cited,
perhaps, more alarm than it could
ju&s;tify, and rai&s;ed once more the conflict of
contra&s;ted intere&s;ts. She had never liked
Montoni. The fire and keenne&s;s of his
eye, its proud exultation, its bold fierce|ne&s;s,
its &s;ullen watchfulne&s;s, as occa&s;ion,
and even &s;light occa&s;ion, had called forth the
latent &s;oul, &s;he had often ob&s;erved with emo|tion;
while from the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion of his
countenance &s;he had always &s;hrunk. From
&s;uch ob&s;ervations &s;he was the more inclined
to believe, that it was this Montoni, of
whom the Italian had uttered his &s;u&s;picious
<PB N="420" REF="432">
hints. The thought of being &s;olely in his
power, in a foreign land, was terrifying to
her, but it was not by terror alone that &s;he
was urged to an immediate marriage with
Valancourt. The tendere&s;t love had already
pleaded his cau&s;e, but had been unable to
overcome her opinion, as to her duty, her
di&s;intere&s;ted con&s;iderations for Valancourt,
and the delicacy, which made her revolt from
a clande&s;tine union. It was not to be ex|pected,
that a vague terror would be more
powerful, than the united influence of love
and grief. But it recalled all their energy,
and rendered a &s;econd conque&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>With Valancourt, who&s;e imagination was
now awake to the &s;ugge&s;tion of every pa&s;&s;ion;
who&s;e apprehen&s;ions for Emily had acquired
&s;trength by the mere mention of them, and be|came
every in&s;tant more powerful, as his mind
brooded over them&mdash;with Valancourt no &s;e|cond
conque&s;t was attainable. He thought
he &s;aw in the cleare&s;t light, and love a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
the fear, that this journey to Italy
would involve Emily in mi&s;ery; he deter|minded,
<PB N="421" REF="433">
therefore, to per&s;evere in oppo&s;ing
it, and in conjuring her to be&s;tow upon
him the title of her lawful protector.</P>
<P>"Emily!" &s;aid he, with &s;olemn earne&s;t|ne&s;s,
"this is no time for &s;erupulous di&s;|tinctions,
for weighing the dubious and
comparatively trifling circum&s;tances, that
may affect our future comfort. I now &s;ee.,
much more clearly than before, the train of
&s;erious dangers you are going to encounter
with a man of Montoni's character. Tho&s;e
dark hints of the Italian &s;poke much, but
not more than the idea I have of Montoni's
di&s;po&s;ition, as exhibited even in his counte|nance.
I think I &s;ee at this moment all that
could have been hinted, written there. He is
the Italian, whom I fear, and I conjure you
for your own &s;ake, as well as for mine, to
prevent the evils I &s;hudder to fore&s;ee. O
Emily! let my tenderne&s;s, my arms with|hold
you from them&mdash;give me the right to
defend you!"</P>
<P>Emily only &s;ighed, while Valancourt pro|ceeded
to remon&s;trate and to entreat with
<PB N="422" REF="434">
all the energy that love and apprehen&s;ion
could in&s;pire. But, as his imagination
magnified to her the po&s;&s;ible evils &s;he was
going to meet, the mi&s;ts of her own fancy
began to di&s;&s;ipate, and allowed her to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the exaggerated images, which im|po&s;ed
on his rea&s;on. She con&s;idered, that
there was no proof of Montoni being the
per&s;on, whom the &s;tranger had meant;
that, even if he was &s;o, the Italian had no|ticed
his character and broken fortunes
merely from report; and that, though the
countenance of Montoni &s;eemed to give pro|bability
to a part of the rumour, it was.
not by &s;uch circum&s;tances that an implicit
belief of it could be ju&s;tified. The&s;e con|&s;iderations
would probably not have ari&s;en
&s;o di&s;tinctly to her mind, at this time, had
not the terrors of Valancourt pre&s;ented to
her &s;uch obvious exaggerations of her dan|ger,
as incited her to di&s;tru&s;t the fallacies of
pa&s;&s;ion. But, while &s;he endeavoured in
the gentle&s;t manner to convince him of his
error, &s;he plunged him into a new one.
<PB N="423" REF="435">
His voice and countenance changed to an
expre&s;&s;ion of dark de&s;pair. "Emily!"
&s;aid he, "this, this moment is the bittere&s;t
that is yet come to me. You do not&mdash;cannot
love me!&mdash;It would be impo&s;&s;ible for you to
rea&s;on thus coolly, thus deliberately, if you
did. I, <HI>I</HI> am torn with angui&s;h at the pro|&s;pect
of our &s;eparation, and of the evils that
may await you in con&s;equence of it; I would
encounter any hazards to prevent it&mdash;to
&s;ave you. No! Emily, no!&mdash;you cannot
love me."</P>
<P>"We have now little time to wa&s;te in ex|clamation,
or a&s;&s;ertion," &s;aid Emily, endea|vouring
to conceal her emotion: "if you
are yet to learn how dear you are, and ever
mu&s;t be, to my heart, no a&s;&s;urances of mine
can give you conviction."</P>
<P>The la&s;t words faltered on her lips, and
her tears flowed fa&s;t. Tho&s;e words and
tears brought, once more, and with in&s;tan|taneous
force, conviction of her love to Va|lancourt.
He could only exclaim, "Emi|ly!
Emily!" and weep over the hand he
<PB N="424" REF="436">
pre&s;&s;ed to his lips; but &s;he, after &s;ome mo|ments,
again rou&s;ed her&s;elf from the indul|gence
of &s;orrow, and &s;aid, "I mu&s;t leave
you; it is late, and my ab&s;ence from the
chateau may be di&s;covered. Think of me&mdash;love
me&mdash;when I am far away; the be|lief
of this will be my comfort!"</P>
<P>"Think of you!&mdash;love you!" exclaimed
Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Try to moderate the&s;e tran&s;ports," &s;aid
Emily, "for my &s;ake, try."</P>
<P>"For your &s;ake!"</P>
<P>"Yes, for my &s;ake," replied Emily, in a
tremulous voice, "I cannot leave you
thus!"</P>
<P>"Then do not leave me!" &s;aid Valancourt,
with quickne&s;s. "Why &s;hould we part,
or part for longer than till to-morrow?"</P>
<P>"I am, indeed I am, unequal to the&s;e
moments," replied Emily, "you tear my
heart, but I never can con&s;ent to this ha&s;ty,
imprudent propo&s;al!"</P>
<P>"If we could command our time, my
<PB N="425" REF="437">
Emily, it &s;hould not be thus ha&s;ty; we
mu&s;t &s;ubmit to circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t, indeed! I have already told
you all my heart&mdash;my &s;pirits are gone.
You allowed the force of my objections, till
your tenderne&s;s called up vague terrors,
which have given us both unnece&s;&s;ary an|gui&s;h.
Spare me! do not oblige me to re|peat
the rea&s;ons I have already urged."</P>
<P>"Spare you!" cried Valancourt, "I am
a wretch&mdash;a very wretch, that have felt
only for my&s;elf!&mdash;I! who ought to have
&s;hewn the fortitude of man, who ought
to have &s;upported you, l! have increa&s;ed
your &s;ufferings by the conduct of a child!
Forgive me, Emily! think of the di&s;trac|tion
of my mind now that I am about to
part with, all that is dear to me&mdash;and forgive
me! When you are gone, I &s;hall recollect!
with bitter remor&s;e what I have made you
&s;uffer, and &s;hall wi&s;h in vain that I could
&s;ee you, if only for a moment, that I might
&s;ooth your grief."</P>
<P>Tears again interrupted his voice, and
Emily wept with him. "I will &s;hew my
<PB N="426" REF="438">
&s;elf more worthy of your love," &s;aid Va|lancourt,
at length; "I will not prolong
the&s;e moments. My Emily&mdash;my own
Emily! never forget me! God knows
when we &s;hall meet again! I re&s;ign you to
his care&mdash;. O God!&mdash;O God!&mdash;protect
and ble&s;s her!"</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his heart. Emily
&s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s on his bo&s;om; and nei|ther
wept, nor &s;poke. Valancourt, now
commanding his own di&s;tre&s;s, tried to com|fort
and re-a&s;&s;ure her, but &s;he appeared to|tally
unaffected by what he &s;aid, and a &s;igh,
which &s;he uttered, now and then, was all
that proved &s;he had not fainted.</P>
<P>He &s;upported her &s;lowly towards the cha|teau,
weeping and &s;peaking to her; but &s;he
an&s;wered only in &s;ighs, till, having reached
the gate, that terminated the avenue, &s;he
&s;eemed to have recovered her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s,
and, looking round, perceived how near
they were to the chateau. "We mu&s;t part
here," &s;aid &s;he, &s;topping, "Why prolong
the&s;e moments? Teach me the fortitude
I have forgot."</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="439">
Valancourt &s;truggled to a&s;&s;ume a com|po&s;ed
air. "Farewell, my love!" &s;aid he,
in a voice of &s;olemn tenderne&s;s&mdash;"tru&s;t me
we &s;hall meet again&mdash;meet for each other&mdash;meet
to part no more!" His voice fal|tered,
but, recovering it, he proceeded in a
firmer tone. "You know not what I
&s;hall &s;uffer, till I hear from you; I &s;hall
omit no opportunity of conveying to you
my letters, yet I tremble to think how few
may occur. And tru&s;t me, love, for your
dear &s;ake, I will try to bear this ab&s;ence
with fortitude. O how little I have &s;hewn
to-night!"</P>
<P>"Farewell!" &s;aid Emily faintly. "When
you are gone, I &s;hall think of many things I
would have &s;aid to you." "And I of many&mdash;many!"
&s;aid Valancourt; "I never left
you yet, that I did not immediately remem|ber
&s;ome que&s;tion, or &s;ome entreaty, or &s;ome
circum&s;tance, concerning my love, that I ear|ne&s;tly
wi&s;hed to mention, and feel wretched
becau&s;e I could not. O Emily! this counte|nance,
on which I now gaze&mdash;will, in a
moment, be gone from my eyes, and not
<PB N="428" REF="440">
all the efforts of fancy will be able to recall
it with exactne&s;s. O! what an infinite
difference between this moment and, the
next! <HI>Now,</HI> I am in your pre&s;ence, can be|hold
you! <HI>then,</HI> all will be a dreary blank&mdash;and
I &s;hall be a wanderer, exiled from my
only home!"</P>
<P>Valancourt again pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart,
and held her there in &s;ilence, weeping.
Tears once again calmed her oppre&s;&s;ed mind.
They again bade each other farewell, lin|gered
a moment, and then parted, Valan|court
&s;eemed to force him&s;elf from the &s;pot;
he pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily up the avenue, and Emily,
as &s;he moved &s;lowly towards the chateau,
heard his di&s;tant &s;teps. She li&s;tened to the
&s;ounds, as they &s;unk fainter and fainter,
till the melancholy &s;tillne&s;s of night alone
remained; and then hurried to her cham|ber,
to &s;eek repo&s;e, which, alas! was fled
from her wretchedne&s;s.</P>
