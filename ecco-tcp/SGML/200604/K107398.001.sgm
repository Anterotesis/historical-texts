<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Here pre&s;ent the Reader with a Volume of Letters writ up|on very different Occa&s;ions, at very different Times. They are far from being all of them equal, but I hope their Variety will make amends for their Inequality. I make no doubt but that upon peru&s;al of the Cri|tical part of them, the old Accu&s;ation will be brought again&s;t me, and there will be a fre&s;h Outcry among Thought|le&s;s People, that I am an Ill-natur'd Man. 'Tis very odd that I &s;hould have that Character only from Per&s;ons who never knew me, and who never were once in my Company. But there are People in the World who imagine that Critici&s;m mu&s;t be the Effect of Ill na|ture. The&s;e Per&s;ons know not what is meant by either of the Terms, either
<PB REF="5">
Critici&s;m or Ill-nature; otherwi&s;e they would be convinced that a good Criti|ci&s;m is the be&s;t-natur'd thing in the World. For by Goodne&s;s of Nature mu&s;t be meant &s;omething that comes up to the true Nature of Man; el&s;e it would be a Term of Reproach, in&s;tead of Commendation. But the true Na|ture of Man is a Rea&s;onable and a Social Nature. And a good Critici&s;m, is both Rea&s;onable and Social. It detects Er|ror, illu&s;trates Truth, advances Art, and con&s;equently has a direct Tendency to the Advancement of the national Ho|nour. If this la&s;t is true of good Criti|ci&s;m in general, it mu&s;t be mo&s;t true of a ju&s;t Critici&s;m upon the Tragedy of <HI>Cato.</HI> That Tragedy met with Succe&s;s which never any other did. It was act|ed for a Month together. It has been tran&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and into <HI>Italian,</HI> which never happen'd to any of our Dramatick Poems before. And 'tis plain to all the Judges of Poetry, that it has a Thou&s;and &s;hameful Faults, and very
<PB REF="6">
few natural Beauties. What mu&s;t the Knowers in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> &s;ay, upon reading the&s;e Tran&s;lations? Mu&s;t they not Di&s;cour&s;e after this Manner? The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation boa&s;t much of their Poe|try; they extol to the Skies, their <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> their <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> their <HI>Mil|ton</HI>: But yet they applaud nothing &s;o loudly as this Tragedy of <HI>Cato.</HI> They have got it tran&s;lated both into <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> and have &s;ent it to us as a Ma&s;ter-Piece to In&s;ult us. El&s;e why has this Tragedy only been tran&s;lated? And yet this Tragedy, at the &s;ame time that it has a Thou&s;and Faults, and mo&s;t of them very gro&s;s ones; has very few Beauties, and tho&s;e which it has are perhaps not of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Growth, but are deriv'd from <HI>Lu|can</HI> and <HI>Seneca.</HI> What then mu&s;t we think of tho&s;e other Poets, their <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> their <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> their <HI>Milton,</HI> whom they formerly &s;o much extol'd, but not half &s;o much as <HI>Cato?</HI> Mu&s;t we not conclude, that the&s;e I&s;landers are
<PB REF="7">
very indifferent Poets, and more indiffe|rent Judges?</P>
<P>I appeal to the rea&s;onable and im|partial Reader, if this mu&s;t not be the Sen&s;e of all the knowing <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> who have &s;een the&s;e Tran&s;lati|ons. Let the rea&s;onable and impartial Reader judge then, if a ju&s;t Critici&s;m upon <HI>Cato</HI> was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, both for the Advantage of Dramatick Poetry, to which the unde&s;erv'd Succe&s;s of this Tragedy has done infinite Harm, and for the Vindication of the National Honour; let the Reader judge, if it was not nece&s;&s;ary, that a Man who owns that he admires the noble Genius of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> admires the unparallell'd Sublimity of the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> of <HI>Mil|ton,</HI> that he is infinitely pleas'd with the Ma&s;ter-Pieces of <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> and exceed|ingly delighted with &s;everal of our other Comick Poets, &s;hould give his Rea&s;ons to all the World why he has no E&s;teem for <HI>Cato?</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="8">
If what I have &s;aid is not &s;ufficient to appea&s;e the Fury of a Headlong Cabal; but they will &s;till cry out that the Criti|cal Letters in this Volume upon the Tra|gedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> are the Effects of Ill-na|ture, I mu&s;t beg leave to exclaim in my turn, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, let them be who they will, &s;hew a deplorable want of publick Spirit, who can prefer the Reputation of one Man, and a Reputati|on which he does not de&s;erve to po&s;&s;e&s;s, before the Advantage of a noble Art, and the Honour of their Country.</P>
<P>But perhaps 'tis not the Author of <HI>Cato</HI> that the&s;e Per&s;ons are &s;o much concern'd for, 'tis them&s;elves. 'Tis them&s;elves and their own Satisfaction, which they prefer to the Pro&s;perity of the Commonwealth of Learning, and to the Good and Ho|nour of their Country. There are in the World very vain Per&s;ons, who are re&s;olv'd to maintain the good Opinion which they have of them&s;elves, at the Expence of every thing, and utterly de|te&s;t
<PB REF="9">
the Man who &s;hall dare to di&s;turb them in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, by &s;hewing them that they have pa&s;s'd a very fooli&s;h Judgment.</P>
<P>If any are di&s;gu&s;ted that the&s;e Ob&s;er|vations are publi&s;h'd after the Death of the Author of that Tragedy, I can a&s;&s;ure them, that they were writ in two long Letters to a Friend immediately after the REMARKS which were printed. By what Artifice tho&s;e two Letters were got out of my Hands, by what Fortune I re|covered the Sub&s;tance of them, and how it came to take the form which it now has, I &s;hall not here declare; not the fir&s;t, thro' regard to the Memory of the Dead; nor the two latter, thro' Re&s;pect to the precious Time of the Living.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave of this Subject I think my &s;elf oblig'd to do Ju&s;tice to the Memory of Mr. ADDISON, who was certainly a Learned and very Ingeni|ous Man: And &s;everal of the <HI>Tatlers</HI>
<PB REF="10">
and <HI>Spectators</HI> which were writ by him de|&s;erv'd the Applau&s;e which they met with.</P>
<P>I hope that what I have &s;aid will &s;uf|fice to &s;atisfy every rea&s;onable Impartial Reader, who is a true Lover of His Country. For the re&s;t, I have long &s;ince learnt to e&s;teem their Cen&s;ures according to their ju&s;t Value.</P>

<HEAD>TO Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Moral and Conclu&s;ion of an <HI>Epick Poem.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN I &s;ent you my Ob&s;ervations, upon the Two fir&s;t Acts of the Play, I &s;ent you &s;o many Rea&s;ons which oblig'd me to differ from you, with re&s;pect to the Encomium, which you give to that Tragedy, in your <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> upon <HI>Epick Poetry.</HI> And whenever you think fit to lay your Com|mands upon me, I &s;hall lay before you the Rea|&s;ons, for which I di&s;&s;ent from you, with regard to the Commendation which you give to a <HI>late Tran&s;lation.</HI> At pre&s;ent I &s;hall pa&s;s to Things more general, and con&s;equently of far great Importance.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="16">
IN the Chapter which treats of the Moral, you are plea&s;ed to affirm two Things; The fir&s;t is, That one who writes an Epick Poem, need not in his fir&s;t Intention, pitch upon &s;ome con|&s;iderable Moral, and then contrive his Fable &s;uit|able to that De&s;ign; The Second Thing is, That there is no occa&s;ion that an Epick Poem &s;hould end Fortunately with regard to the Principal Cha|racter.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, before I give my Rea&s;ons for di&s;|&s;enting from you, with regard to the&s;e Two Points; the fir&s;t of which is of Con&s;equence, and the Second of the utmo&s;t Importance: I de&s;ire that you would give me leave to enumerate &s;ome Things, in which we perfectly Agree; that by this Method, we may facilitate an Agreement in Things in which we Differ.</P>
<P>We agree then, Sir, in the following Points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there mu&s;t be a Fable. <HI>E&s;&s;ay.</HI> p. 37.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there mu&s;t be an Action. <HI>E&s;&s;.</HI> p. 47.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Action mu&s;t be one. p. <HI>ibid.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That there mu&s;t be a Moral. p. 76.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the Fable and the Action mu&s;t be only for the Moral. <HI>Ibid.</HI> &amp; p. 34.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That the Moral mu&s;t be the genuine Re|&s;ult of the Fable and the Action. p. 77.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That Admiration ought to be the predo|minant Pa&s;&s;ion in the narration of the Action. p. 33.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Nothing that is common or ordinary, can excite Admiration. p. 34 &amp; 35.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That there ought to be an Allegory. p. 41.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="3" REF="17">
THESE, Sir, are Things in which we agree ex|pre&s;ly: There are other Things in which we agree implicitly, becau&s;e if the&s;e la&s;t are fal&s;e, they de|&s;troy the Truth even of tho&s;e in which we agree expre&s;ly; as that</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Moral mu&s;t contain an undeniable Truth, or el&s;e it cannot be a Moral: For Fal&s;hood may delude, but only Truth can in&s;truct.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the In&s;truction which the Poem gives, mu&s;t be general; Moral Philo&s;ophy being the Law of Nature, and con&s;equently, in&s;tructive to Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Poetick Action mu&s;t remain ge|neral, even after the Impo&s;ition of Names; for if the Action is particular, there can be no ge|neral In&s;truction deduced from it; the Conclu|&s;ion being fal&s;e to generals from particulars.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the Characters at the bottom mu&s;t be general likewi&s;e, even after the Impo&s;ition of Names.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the Action and Characters being both general, even after the Impo&s;ition of Names, they mu&s;t be, con&s;equently, both Allegorical.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>LET us come now, Sir, to the two foremen|tion'd Particulars.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay, That an Epick Poet is not oblig'd to have the Moral fir&s;t in his Mind: For, &s;ay you, no Author can form the Narration of any great and memorable Action, but &s;ome Moral
<PB N="4" REF="18">
will ari&s;e from it, whether the Writer intends it or not. Suppo&s;e this were true, a Poet is to In|&s;truct by his Art and not by Chance. But the very contrary of this is true, a Poet may form the Narration, of a Hundred great and memorable Actions, if the&s;e Actions are Particular and Hi|&s;torical, and not one Moral &s;hall ari&s;e from them all; as the Battle of <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> the Death of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> the Death of <HI>Cato,</HI> the Death of King <HI>Lear,</HI> the Death of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> the Death of <HI>Harry</HI> the Fourth: And I defie any Poet to form a general Action, and general Cha|racters, but he mu&s;t form them upon a Moral, and con&s;equently that Moral mu&s;t be fir&s;t in his Head. Can any one believe, that <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> fir&s;t told a Story of a Cock and a Bull, and afterwards made a Moral to it? Or is it rea&s;onable to be|lieve, that he made his Moral fir&s;t, and after|wards to prove it, contriv'd his Fable? Now I know no difference that there is, between one of <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s Fables, and the Fable of an Epick Poem, as to their Natures, tho' there be many and great ones, as to their Circum&s;tances. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Poet to form any Fable, unle&s;s the Moral be fir&s;t in his Head.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay that &s;ince <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> does not expre&s;ly draw any Doctrine from their Fables, it is not certain whether they de&s;ign'd any; and it is &s;till more uncertain, you &s;ay, whether they intended tho&s;e particular Morals, which are ge|nerally a&s;crib'd to them; which is as much as to &s;ay, that, tho' we can &s;ee a De&s;ign, a good, a ju&s;t, and a great De&s;ign in tho&s;e admirable Poems,
<PB N="5" REF="19">
yet the Authors of them &s;aw none, and that, per|haps that is not their De&s;ign, which appears to us and others, but &s;omething, which after &s;o many Ages, has appeared to no Man. Could <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> if they had &s;tudied a Thou&s;and Years, have contrived Morals, which would have been more the genuine re&s;ult of all the Parts of their Fables and of their Actions, than tho&s;e which are generally a&s;cribed to them? Or can tho&s;e Morals be made to appear the genuine re&s;ult of any other Poetick Actions, unle&s;s they are Copies of tho&s;e?</P>
<P>YOU continue to &s;ay, That as from Pulpit Di&s;cour&s;es on Divine Subjects, many u&s;eful In|ferences may be deduc'd by the Preacher; &s;o in the&s;e &s;uperior Poems, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But here, Sir, you ap|pear not to con&s;ider, that the grand Moral of every Sermon is the Text, which certainly is, or ought to be, fir&s;t in the Mind of every Preacher.</P>
<P>TO conclude my Remarks on this fir&s;t Point; it appears to me evident, that every Man who undertakes any great Action, has the chief De|&s;ign which he propo&s;es by it, fir&s;t of all in his Head; but you your&s;elf are plea&s;ed to own, p. 34. <HI>That the principal End of an Epick Poet, is to give Plea&s;ure and In&s;truction</HI>; and p. 76. <HI>That the Plea&s;ure is only in order to the In&s;tru|ction</HI>; and p. 77. <HI>That the mo&s;t important part of the In&s;truction ought to ari&s;e from the whole Fable, becau&s;e the In&s;truction that ari&s;es from the whole, mu&s;t be more important than that which ari&s;es from the Parts.</HI> By owning all
<PB N="6" REF="20">
which, it is clear to me that you implicitly own, That the Moral of an Epick Poem mu&s;t be fir&s;t in the Head of the Poet.</P>
<P>I now, Sir, come to the Second Point, con|cerning which we differ. You are pleas'd to affirm, That it is not nece&s;&s;ary, that an Epick Poem &s;hould end happily, with relation to the Principal Character, but that the Poets and mere Criticks have laid down this Rule, without con|&s;ulting Rea&s;on in the Ca&s;e, being led into it by the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the <HI>Aeneis</HI> of <HI>Virgil:</HI> And here you deplore that &s;ervile Sub|mi&s;&s;ion which the Poets and Commentators have made to naked Anthority, by which they have advanc'd Maxims out of Reverence to great Names, without any Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Subject, or entering upon any Enquiry which &s;upports their A&s;&s;ertion; becau&s;e, &s;ay you, the End of the Epick Poet may be equally attain'd, tho' the Event &s;hould be Unfortunate; into which we are now to Enquire.</P>
<P>THE principal Character of an Epick Poem, mu&s;t be either morally good or morally vicious; if he is morally good, the making him end un|fortunately, will de&s;troy all Poetical Ju&s;tice, and con&s;equently, all In&s;truction: Such a Poem can have no Moral, and con&s;equently no Fable, no ju&s;t and regular Poetical Action, but mu&s;t be a vain Fiction and an empty Amu&s;ement. Oh, but there is a Retribution in Futurity! But I thought that the Reader of an Epick Poem was to owe his In&s;truction to the Poet, and not to
<PB N="7" REF="21">
him&s;elf: Well then, the Poet may tell him &s;o at the latter end of his Poem: Ay, would to God I could &s;ee &s;uch a latter End of an Epick Poem, where the Poet &s;hould tell the Reader, that he has cut an hone&s;t Man's Throat, only that he may have an Opportunity to &s;end him to Heaven; and that tho' this would be but an indifferent Plea upon an Indictment for Murder at the Old-Baily, yet that he hopes the good-natur'd Reader will have Compa&s;&s;ion on him, as the Gods have on his Hero. But Raillery apart, Sir, What occa|&s;ion is there for having recour&s;e to an Epick Poet to tell our &s;elves by the bye, and by occa&s;ional Re|flection, that there will be a Retribution in Futu|rity, when the Chri&s;tian has this in his Heart con&s;tantly and directly, and the Athei&s;t and Free|thinker will make no &s;uch Reflection? Tell me truly, Sir, would not &s;uch a Poet appear to you or me, not to have &s;ufficiently con&s;ider'd what a Poetical Moral is? And &s;hould not you, or I Sir, be oblig'd, in order to make him comprehend the Nature of it, to lay before him that univer&s;al Moral, which is the Foundation of all Morals, both Epick and Dramatick, and is inclu&s;ive of them all, and that is, That He who does good, and per&s;everes in it, &s;hall always be Rewarded, and he who does ill and per&s;everes in it, &s;hall always be puni&s;h'd? Should we not de&s;ire him to ob&s;erve, That the fore&s;aid Reward mu&s;t always attend and crown good Actions, not &s;ometimes only, for then it would follow, that &s;ometimes a per&s;everance in good Actions has no Reward, which would take away all Poetical In&s;truction,
<PB N="8" REF="22">
and indeed every &s;ort of Moral In&s;truction, re|&s;olving Providence into Chance or Fate. Should we not, Sir, farther put him in Mind, that &s;ince whoever per&s;everes in good Actions, is &s;ure to be Rewarded at the la&s;t, it follows, that a Poet does not a&s;&s;ert by his Moral, that he is always &s;ure to be Rewarded in this World, becau&s;e that would be fal&s;e, as you have very ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, <HI>p.</HI> 60. and therefore never can be the Moral of an Epick Poem, becau&s;e what is fal&s;e may De|lude, but only Truth can In&s;truct. Should we not let him know, Sir, that this univer&s;al Moral only teaches us, That whoever per&s;everes in good Actions, &s;hall be always &s;ure to be Rewarded ei|ther here or hereafter; and that the Truth of this Moral is prov'd by the Poet, by making the principal Character of his Poem, like all the re&s;t of his Characters, and like the Poetical Action, at the bottom, Univer&s;al and Allegorical, even after di&s;tingui&s;hing it by a particular Name, by making this principal Character at the bottom, a meer Poetical Phantom, of a very &s;hort du|ration, thro' the whole extent of which duration we can &s;ee at once, which continues no longer than the reading of the Poem, and that being over, the Phantom is to us nothing, &s;o that unle&s;s our Sen&s;e is &s;atisfy'd of the Re|ward that is given to this Poetical Phantome, who&s;e whole duration we &s;ee thro' from the very beginning to the end; in&s;tead of a whol&s;ome Moral, there would be a pernicious In&s;truction, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Man may per&s;evere in good Actions and not be Rewarded for it thro' the whole ex|tent
<PB N="9" REF="23">
of his duration, that is neither in this World nor in the World to come.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the principal Character of an Epick Poem is morally vicious, yet the Poem ought not to end unfortunately with relation to that principal Character. But here, Sir, I think my &s;elf oblig'd to explain my &s;elf: By a Character morally vicious, I by no means mean a Villain|ous Character: Becau&s;e a Villain can never have greatne&s;s of Mind nor greatne&s;s of Capacity &s;uf|ficient to perform Things de&s;erving to be admir'd. But Admiration is, as it were, the In&s;trument by which the Poet works his End, which is In&s;tru|ction, as has been acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>BY a Character morally vicious then, I mean &s;uch a Character as is compounded of good and bad Qualities, the good at the &s;ame time over|coming the bad, and Hiding them as the Sun does Mercury, by the greatne&s;s of their Neigh|bouring Lu&s;tre: Now a Poet is not to make an Heroick Poem end Unfortunately, with relation to &s;uch a Character, becau&s;e &s;uch an end would weaken and de&s;troy that Admiration which is re|qui&s;ite for the Poet's attaining his End, and de|&s;troy or weaken it in the very place where its In|fluence is mo&s;t requi&s;ite. For as the greate&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ion that a Poem is to make, ought to be made at the end of it, the reigning Pa&s;&s;ion of that Poem ought to predominate mo&s;t there. As therefore Terrour and Compa&s;&s;ion ought to be mo&s;t violently mov'd, at the Cata&s;trophe of a Tragedy, and Laughter at that of a Comedy, Admiration ought to be rais'd to its utmo&s;t height,
<PB N="10" REF="24">
at the end of an Epick Poem. But if that Poem &s;hould end unfortunately, with relation to &s;uch a compounded Character, as we have ju&s;t mention'd above, it would cau&s;e great Indignation in &s;ome, and great Compa&s;&s;ion in others: Now as great Indignation and great Compa&s;&s;ion are always at|tended with Grief, Admiration is con&s;tantly ac|companied with Joy. An Epick Poet therefore, by exciting Compa&s;&s;ion or Indignation at the latter end of his Poem, in&s;tead of Admiration, would make that Poem throw off its Nature and a&s;&s;ume that of Tragedy, which is as directly con|trary to its own, as Grief is to Joy, or as Light is to Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOR would &s;uch a pro&s;perous End, in rela|tion to &s;uch a Character, be in the lea&s;t a viola|tion of Poetick Ju&s;tice, tho' for the mo&s;t part in Tragedy, it would be a very great one; be|cau&s;e the Hero of an Epick Poem always carries on &s;ome good and great De&s;ign, for the Advan|tage of that Society, of which he is the chief, or an illu&s;trious Member, at lea&s;t, it has been &s;o, in all the Epick Poems I have yet &s;een; tho' this is far from being always the Ca&s;e in Tragedy; now that publick Virtue makes Compen&s;ation for all Faults but Crimes, and he who has this publick Virtue is not capable of Crimes. The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Athenians,</HI> while Liberty flouri&s;h'd among them, would have look'd very coldly upon a Poet, who &s;hould have &s;hewn a great Patriot unfortunate, only for being a great Patriot. In order to encourage publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and the Love of their Coun|trey,
<PB N="11" REF="25">
they oblig'd their Epick Poets, to &s;hew tho&s;e Virtues crown'd with Glory and Felicity. Nay, the Ancients made the very future Happi|ne&s;s of their Heroes depend upon the Succe&s;s of their good and great De&s;igns for the Welfare of their Country: Witne&s;s that famous pa&s;&s;age in the Fragment of <HI>Cicero, De &s;omnio Ciceronis Sed, quo &s;is, Africane, alacrior. ad Tutandam Rem|publicam, &s;ic Habeto: Oomnibus, qui patriam con&s;ervaverint, adjuverint, auxerint, certum e&s;&s;e in caelo, ac Definitum locum, ubi Beati aevo &s;empiterno fruantur.</HI></P>
<P>FOR my part, I have no Notion, that a &s;uf|fering Hero can be proper for Epick Poetry. <HI>Milton</HI> could make but very little, even of a Suffering God, who makes quite another Im|pre&s;&s;ion with his Lightning and his Thunder in <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> than with his Meckne&s;s and his Stoici&s;m in <HI>Paradi&s;e Regain'd</HI>: That great Spirit which Heroick Poetry requires, flows from great Pa&s;&s;ions and from great Actions: If the &s;uffering Hero remains in&s;en&s;ible the generality of Readers will not be much concern'd for one, who is &s;o little concern'd for him&s;elf. The Greatne&s;s of his Mind may, perhaps, be admir'd by a few, who are them&s;elves magnanimous, but the Au|thor of an Epick Poem ought to write to Man|kind, and not only to the Age wherein he lives, but to remote&s;t Po&s;terity. If the Hero of an Epick Poem &s;hould not appear in&s;en&s;ible in his Sufferings, his Sen&s;ibility will be attended with Pa&s;&s;ions, which are not only incompatible with that Admiration, which ought to be mov'd thro
<PB N="12" REF="26">
the Poem, but which will &s;ink its Spirit, and deba&s;e its Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>LET us then, Sir, leave the Virtues of Pati|ence and long Suffering to be taught by Prie&s;ts: They will not fail to inculcate &s;uch Doctrines fre|quently, as being at once con&s;i&s;tent with their Duty and their Craft: But never fear that they will intrench upon your Province, and recom|mend publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and the Love of their Country, to a People, whom they have &s;hewn too clearly, that 'tis their De&s;ign to en&s;lave. But for your part, Sir, that you may de&s;erve more and more of your Country and of Mankind, make Choice of a Hero, who&s;e every Action may flow from tho&s;e noble Principles, and Reform a degenerate Age, which &s;eems &s;o fond of Slavery. Let his great Actions be crown'd with Glory and Victory, with the Joy|ful Acclamations of the People, whom he has made happy by his Heroick Conduct and Virtue, and with &s;uch tran&s;cendent Felicity, as may rai&s;e the highe&s;t Admiration in the Brea&s;t of every Reader, inflame every one of them with the love of his Country, and with a burning Zeal to imi|tate what he admires.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the <HI>Vis Comica.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the favour of a Vi&s;it from you the other Day, I was in a great deal of Pain, and had been &s;o for a Day and a Night before you &s;aw me, and con|tinued &s;o for the &s;ame &s;pace of Time after you left me, and then I voided a Stone about the big|ne&s;s of a Pea, and &s;o thanks be to God, have been ever &s;ince at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT what perhaps may &s;urprize you, is this, That in the mid&s;t of all this Mi&s;ery, I read over four Comedies of <HI>Terence, viz.</HI> The <HI>Eunuch,</HI> the <HI>Heautontimorumenos,</HI> the <HI>Adelphi,</HI> and the <HI>Phormio.</HI> The&s;e I read over in the two Evenings ofmy Ill|ne&s;s, in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Quarto Edition, a very convenient one for a Per&s;on of my gravity, in a Winter's Evening, tho' he who had the Care of the Edition, under&s;tood nothing of the Stage. In
<PB N="14" REF="28">
the two Mornings of my Illne&s;s, I read over Mrs <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Comment upon the Four Comedies, and upon the Life of <HI>Terence</HI> writ by <HI>Suetonius.</HI> I have told you more than once, that when the Commentators had &s;ometimes led me into a Bog, my own Common Sen&s;e had help'd to guide me out again. You may gue&s;s what a de|ference I pay to the Herd of Commentators, when you will &s;ee by what follows, that I have the A&s;&s;urance to contradict Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Fevre</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> his Daughter, for who&s;e Learn|ing, Judgment, and fine Di&s;cernment I have al|ways had a &s;ingular Regard and E&s;teem.</P>
<P>YOU know very well, Sir, that <HI>Suetonius</HI> in the latter end of his Life of <HI>Terence,</HI> has men|tion'd &s;ome Ver&s;es of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> in which that Emperor calls <HI>Terence</HI> a Demy <HI>Menander,</HI> and complains that the <HI>Vis Comica</HI> was wanting to that Comick Poet.</P>
<Q><L>Tu quoque, Tu in &s;ummis, O dimidiate Menander</L>
<L>Poneris, &amp; merito, puri Sermonis Amat&ocirc;r;</L>
<L>Lenibus at&abque; utinam &s;criptis adjuncta foret vis</L>
<L>Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret Honore</L>
<L>Cum Graecis, ne&abque; in hac de&s;pectus parte jaceres</L>
<L>Unum hoc maceror, &amp; Doleo tibi dee&s;&s;e Terenti.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> in her Remarks upon that part of the Life, &s;ays, That it was the Opinion of her Father Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Fevre,</HI> that by the <HI>Vis Co|mica, Cae&s;ar</HI> meant the Pa&s;&s;ions, from which Opinion the Daughter di&s;&s;ents for the two fol|lowing
<PB N="15" REF="29">
Rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions are natural and e&s;&s;ential to Tragedy, and but inci|dental to Comedy. Secondly, Becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve the Characters, as <HI>Terence</HI> has admirably done, without making them Speak upon occa&s;ion with as much Pa&s;&s;ion as that oc|ca&s;ion requires; which is not only ju&s;tly, but very finely ob&s;erv'd. And, Indeed we find that the Pa&s;&s;ions in <HI>Terence,</HI> upon great &s;urprizes are ex|tream lively and &s;trong. And when <HI>Horace</HI> tells us in his Art of Poetry, that Comedy &s;ometimes u&s;urps upon Tragedy, and has Pa&s;&s;ions which are next to Tragical, He brings his Example from the <HI>Heautontimorumenos</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Interdum tamen, &amp; vocem Comoedia tellit,</L>
<L>Iratusque Chremes tumido Delitigat ore.</L></Q>
<P>But the Explication which Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> her Self, gives of the Words of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> is not a jot better than her Father's. For by <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> meant the Vivacity of the Acti|on, and the tying and &s;olving the Knot of the In|trigue; which is wrong, for two Rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the&s;e both belong to Tragedy as nearly as they do to Comedy. And, Secondly, Becau&s;e, if <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had under&s;tood by his <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> what Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> thinks he did, he could never have call'd <HI>Terence</HI> a Demy <HI>Menander.</HI> For <HI>Te|rence,</HI> having the Bu&s;ine&s;s of two of <HI>Menander's</HI> Comedies in one of his, and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Comedy being of as great a length as the <HI>Roman</HI>; <HI>Terence</HI> mu&s;t con&s;equently have more Intrigue, and a
<PB N="16" REF="30">
greater Vivacity of Action than <HI>Menander,</HI> and con&s;equently, if <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> by his <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> had meant the Intrigue, and the vivacity of Action, He would have nominated <HI>Terence,</HI> a Double, in|&s;tead of a Demy <HI>Menander.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince I have Declared my &s;elf not at all &s;atis|fied with either the Father's or the Daughter's Expli|cation, you may perhaps expect that I &s;hould give my own. I &s;hall do it with Submi&s;&s;ion, but upon this Condition, that if I am in the wrong, you and your Commentators &s;hall &s;et me right.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe both from the Terms, and the Rea&s;on of the Thing, that by the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> mu&s;t be meant &s;omething Comical and peculiar to Comedy. For the chief Force of any kind of Poem, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in that which makes the Characteri&s;tick of it, and which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all other Poems. As the chief Force of Tragedy mu&s;t proceed from the moving Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror &s;trongly, and the Chief Force of Epick Poetry from the exciting Admi|ration, Powerfully, &s;o the chief Force of Comedy mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in exciting Laughter. By the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> then can never be meant the bare Vivacity of the Action, and the tying and &s;olving the Knot of the Intrigue, which is com|mon to both kinds of Dramatick Poetry, as has been ob&s;erv'd above, but the lively Ridicule re|&s;ulting from the Intrigue; the Ridicule of the In|cidents, and e&s;pecially of the Cata&s;trophe, which yet is but a part of the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> for there is likewi&s;e the Ridicule of the Characters proceed|ing from their &s;everal Humours, and the Plea|&s;antry
<PB N="17" REF="31">
of the Sentiments and of the Dialogue. When <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> therefore &s;ays, that <HI>Terence</HI> is but a Demy <HI>Menander,</HI> what does he &s;ay, but that <HI>Terence</HI> had turn'd four or five of <HI>Menander</HI>'s Comedies into Latin, and lo&s;t half the Ridi|cule and the Plea&s;antry of that <HI>Athenian</HI> Poet, in Tran&s;lating him. That this was <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Meaning is plain to me, not only from the Rea&s;on and the Nature of the Thing, which has been &s;hewn above, but from the great De|light which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> took in the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> and the great Encouragement which he gave to the <HI>Mimes</HI> of <HI>Laberius</HI> and <HI>Publius Syrus,</HI> which were low Farces, compos'd on purpo&s;e only to make People Laugh; as likewi&s;e from the Me|thod which <HI>Terence</HI> took in his Ver&s;ions: For taking two of <HI>Menander</HI>'s Plays into one of his, he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity leave a great part of his Dialogue behind him, and by con&s;equence, a great part of his Plea&s;antry: So that the &s;ame thing happen'd to <HI>Menander</HI> formerly, which has befallen <HI>Moliere</HI> in our Days. Several <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Authors have tran&s;lated Parts of him, but not one of them has enter'd into that <HI>naiuet&eacute;</HI> which is the pure&s;t Source of his Plea&s;antry, (as indeed it is of Plea&s;antry in general) for what the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>naiuet&eacute;,</HI> which is a charming Simplicity, dictated by pure Nature, is almo&s;t always Original: For there is &s;omething in it &s;o ea&s;ie, &s;o free, &s;o flowing and &s;o natural, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ies the re&s;traint of a Copy. I do not pretend to &s;ay, that there was none of the <HI>naiuet&eacute;</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="32">
<HI>Menander</HI> in <HI>Terence</HI>; but I may venture to &s;ay after <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> that there is not above half of it, and con&s;equently, not above half his Plea|&s;antry; tho' at the &s;ame time, I believe that there is more of this Quality in <HI>Terence,</HI> than ever there was in a Copy; and if the God of Laughter does not always attend upon <HI>Terence, Venus</HI> and the <HI>Graces</HI> never leave him. 'Tis my humble Opinion, that there is no Dialogue extant in any Language, which has half the Charms of the <HI>Terentian</HI> Dialogue; what comes neare&s;t to it, is that of <HI>Etherege</HI> in Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter.</HI> I, who have been acquainted with <HI>Te|rence</HI> above forty Years, am now more delight|ed with him than ever: And &s;ure that Beauty mu&s;t be no common Charmer, in whom Time &s;hall di&s;cover new Graces, and whom long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, renders more de&s;ireable.</P>
<P>THUS have I given you my Sentiments: If what I take to be the Sen&s;e of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> be not your own, I de&s;ire you would &s;et me right.</P>

But the Part that I have been forc'd to act to the Life, and almo&s;t to the Death, has had &s;o much Tragedy in it, that the Spectators thought more than once, that I would have gone quite off the Stage in an ill Humour.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="36">
I have, may it plea&s;e your Grace, pa&s;s'd the beginning of this Winter in <HI>Southwark,</HI> as my old Patron, and your Grace's old Friend <HI>Phoebus,</HI> pa&s;s'd it in <HI>Greenland.</HI> I have never Ri&s;en 'till Twelve, and after I have been up little more than an Hour, have been forc'd to go to Bed again; have, like him, look'd very Pale and Wan, all the Time I have been up, and have been for the mo&s;t part of that Time, as I may &s;ay, under a Cloud; and it has been con&s;tantly expected, when like my old Pa|tron, I &s;hould have gone under the Horizon for a long time before I ro&s;e again.</P>
<P>BUT while I was thus between Life and Death, and in &s;ore Tribulation, my old Pa|tron came to me by Night, at the Time when he di&s;appeared to all the other Mortals of this Hemi&s;phere? and giving me a &s;winging lug by the Ear, that has made one &s;ide of my Head Sore ever &s;ince, <HI>Pinky</HI> quoth he, be of good Cheer, I have found a way to free thee from all thy Troubles.

<P>But quoth I, to my old Patron, may I put his Grace in Mind of this, and will not he take it ill? Thou may&s;t put him in Mind of it, an&s;wered he, and I will pawn my Divinity on it, that he will not take it ill.</P>
<P>THUS, my Lord, depending on his Divinity, and on your Grace's Humanity, I have pre|&s;um'd to &s;end you this; and if your Grace takes it otherwi&s;e than it was meant, which was to be&s;peak your Favour, and to Entertain you, I will never for the future believe in <HI>Phoebus,</HI> and will have no more dependance on him, than has a &s;mall Poet, who tires &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively four Pair of Hor&s;es, to engage Per&s;ons of Quality to come to his third Night.</P>

<P>I Sent a Letter on the 28th to your Hou&s;e, Directed to Captain <HI>Steele,</HI> and de&s;iring to &s;ee himthat Night, that I might have his Advice upon a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance, &s;oftly intimating at the &s;ame Time, that it was not in my Power to wait upon him. But having neither &s;een him nor heard from him, I fancy that my old Friend is departed, and &s;ome Gentleman has &s;ucceeded him in the old Hou&s;e, with the &s;ame Name, and the &s;ame Martial Title; a Chance that happens oftener in the World than &s;ome People ima|gine. How &s;hould I have been &s;urpriz'd, in Ca&s;e I had gone my &s;elf, expecting from the Similitude of Name and Title, to have &s;een my old Acquaintance? How &s;hould I have been &s;urpriz'd to have found a Man with quite another Mind, and quite another Countenance? My old Friend, as I thought at lea&s;t, had Ci|vility, had Humanity, had a good and enga|ging

Officiou&s;ne&s;s, and as I did not take him to want good Nature, &s;o he had what the <HI>French</HI> call a good Countenance, that is, the Countenance of one who is pleas'd with him who talks to him.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Upon the Pro&s;pect from LEITH-HILL in <HI>Surrey.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have ever &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t, been either in Motion, or in Places where Ink is a Liquor more precious than <HI>Tockay.</HI> But tho' I have ever &s;ince the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> been in the Country, I have enjoy'd &s;mall Satisfa|ction, if you except what the &s;ight of the Country it&s;elf affords me, which is indeed an Entertainment, of which I can never be weary.</P>
<P>I never in all my Life time left it without Regret, and always return'd to it with Joy. The Sight of a Mountain is to me more agree|able than that of the mo&s;t pompous Edifice; and Meadows and natural winding Streams, plea&s;e me before the mo&s;t beautiful Gardens, and the mo&s;t co&s;tly Canals: So much does Art appear to me to be &s;urpa&s;s'd by Nature, and the Works of Men by the Works of God. But
<PB N="31" REF="45">
here I de&s;ire you to believe, that I &s;peak of the Mechanick Works of Men. For as to the Productions of Human Mind, the more Art &s;ome of them have, as particularly &s;ome &s;orts of Poetry, the more lovely they are, and more e&s;timable; becau&s;e, the more they have in them of true Art, the more they have of Nature; whereas, in the Mechanick Works of Men, the contrary of this is &s;een; for the more con|&s;ummate an Art appears in them, the more they recede from plain and &s;imple Nature.</P>
<P>BUT thither to return from whence I di|gre&s;s'd; as the Sight of the Country has been always more plea&s;ing to me than that of the Town, &s;o, in a late Journey which I took in|to the Wild of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> I pa&s;s'd over a Hill which &s;hew'd me a more tran&s;porting Sight than ever the Country had &s;hewn me before, either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI> The Pro&s;pects, which in <HI>Italy</HI> pleas'd me mo&s;t, were that of the <HI>Valdarno</HI> from the <HI>Apennins,</HI> that of <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> from the Mountain of <HI>Viterbo</HI>; of <HI>Rome</HI> at Forty, and of the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI> at Fifty Miles di&s;tance from it, and that of the <HI>Campagne</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Tiuoli</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI>; from which two Places, you &s;ee every Foot of that famous Campaigne, even from the Bottom of <HI>Tiuoli</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;cati,</HI> to the very Foot of the Mountain of <HI>Viterbo</HI> with|out any thing to intercept your Sight. But from a Hill which I pa&s;s'd in my late Journey into <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> I had a Pro&s;pect more exten&s;ive
<PB N="32" REF="46">
than any of the&s;e, and which &s;urpa&s;s'd them at once in Rural Charms, in Pomp and in Magnificence. The Hill which I &s;peak of is call'd <HI>Leith Hill,</HI> and is about five Miles <HI>Southward</HI> from <HI>Darking</HI>; about &s;ix from <HI>Box-Hill,</HI> and near twelve from <HI>Ep&s;om.</HI> It juts its &s;elf out about two Miles beyond that Range of Hills which terminates the <HI>North Downs</HI> to the <HI>South.</HI> When I &s;aw from one of tho&s;e Hills, at about two Miles di&s;tance, that &s;ide of <HI>Leith Hill</HI> which faces the <HI>Nor|thern Downs</HI>; it appeared the beautifulle&s;t Pro&s;pect to me I had ever &s;een. But after we had conquered the Hill it &s;elf, I &s;aw a Sight that would tran&s;port a Stoick, a Sight that look'd like Enchantment and Vi&s;ion, but Vi|&s;ion Beatifick. Beneath us, lay open to our View, all the Wilds of <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and a great Part of that of <HI>Kent,</HI> admirably Diver|&s;ifyed in every Part of them, with Woods, and Fields of Corn, and Pa&s;tures; tho&s;e Fields of Corn and Pa&s;tures, being every where adorn'd with &s;tately Rows of Trees.</P>
<P>This beautiful Vale, is about thirty Miles in Breadth, and about &s;ixty in Length, and is terminated to the <HI>South,</HI> by the Maje&s;tick Range of the <HI>Southern</HI> Hills and the Sea. And 'tis no ea&s;ie matter to decide, whether the&s;e Hills which appear at thirty, Forty, Fifty, Miles di&s;tance, with their Tops in the Sky, appear more Awful and Venerable, or the Delicious Vale between you and them
<PB N="33" REF="47">
more inviting. About Noon in a &s;erene Day, you may at thirty Miles Di&s;tance &s;ee the very Water of the Sea thro' a Cha&s;m of the Mountains. And that which above all makes it a noble and a wonderful Pro|&s;pect, is, that at the &s;ame time that at chirty Miles Di&s;tance you behold the very Water of the Sea; at the &s;ame time that you be|hold to the <HI>South</HI> the mo&s;t delicious Rural Pro&s;pect in the World; at that very time, by a little turn of your Head towards the <HI>North,</HI> you look full over <HI>Box Hill,</HI> and &s;ee the Country beyond it between that and <HI>London</HI>; and over the very Stomacher of it, &s;ee St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s at five and twenty Miles Di&s;tance, and <HI>London</HI> beneath it, and <HI>High|gate</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> beyond it. It may perhaps appear incredible to &s;ome, that a Place which affords &s;o great and &s;o &s;urpri|&s;ing a Pro&s;pect, &s;hould have remain'd &s;o long in Ob&s;curity; in &s;o great Ob&s;curity, that 'tis unknown to the very Frequenters of <HI>Ep|&s;om</HI> and <HI>Box Hill.</HI> But, alas! we live in a Country more fertile of Great Things, than of Men to admire them. Who ever talked of <HI>Cooper</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI> till Sir <HI>John Den|ham</HI> made it Illu&s;trious? How long did <HI>Mil|ton</HI> remain in Ob&s;curity, while twenty pal|try Authors, little and vile if compared to him, were talk'd of and admir'd? But here in <HI>England</HI> nineteen in twenty like by o|ther Peoples Opinions, and not by their
<PB N="34" REF="48">
own. That Fools by their Approbation &s;hould draw in Fools, as Sheep leap after Sheep, is no great matter of Wonder: But that Fools by their Numbers &s;hould prove &s;o powerful as to influence Men of Sen&s;e, and engage them to approve of what they would otherwi&s;e utterly have contemned, is what I have often wonder'd at, but ne|ver could yet account for; but &s;uch unna|tural mon&s;trous Things as the&s;e, make the Town more odious and the Country more agreeable.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Deceitfulne&s;s of RUMOUR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was always my Opinion, that Judg|ment is a cool and a &s;low Faculty, and no more con&s;tantly attends a Man in the warmth of Wine and of Conver&s;ation, than in the Fury and Rapture of a Poetical Compo&s;ition. If I had in the lea&s;t doubted of this, what pa&s;t at your Hou&s;e, on the fir&s;t of this Month, would have perfectly convinced me of it; where, for want of Coolne&s;s to con&s;ider Things, I betray'd my own Cau&s;e and that of my departed Friend Mr. <HI>Wycherly.</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay but a Word or two of my own, but I de&s;ire to be a little longer about his.</P>
<P>I then declared it to be my Opinion, that <HI>Free-thinking</HI> would at one time or other
<PB N="36" REF="50">
endanger our Con&s;titution; That it invali|dates the very Things which are the great|e&s;t Security both of Princes and People, and tho&s;e are the Oaths which the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI> take either as Subjects or Witne&s;&s;es. To which a Gentleman in the Company an&s;wer'd, that the Oaths derived their binding Force from the very Law of Nature, as well as from the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion; with which An&s;wer, for want of Coolne&s;s and Time to con&s;ider, I remain'd at that in&s;tant &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as I bad Coolne&s;s and Time to con&s;ider, I found that a double Reply might ju&s;tly be made to that An&s;wer of your Friend. For in the fir&s;t Place, the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> are divided into <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts.</HI> Now the former of the&s;e cannot be at all influenced by the Law of Nature. For to them to whom there is no God, there can be no Law of Nature. And as for the latter, tho' <HI>Thei&s;ts</HI> are influenced by the Law of Nature, yet we ought to con|&s;ider, that the Oath which an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is oblig'd to take as a Subject or a Witne&s;s, derives its mo&s;t binding Force, and its mo&s;t &s;acred Solemnity, from that which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it from all other Oaths, and that is the laying Hands upon the Bible and ki&s;|&s;ing it; which Ceremonies are certainly not deduceable from the Law of Nature, but are wholly derived from that Revelation
<PB N="37" REF="51">
which the <HI>Thei&s;ts</HI> do not believe. <HI>Free|thinking</HI> then is the Cau&s;e, why both <HI>A|thei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Thei&s;ts,</HI> by contemning tho&s;e Ceremonies, and disbelieving the Revela|tion from whence they are derived, are come &s;lightly to regard the very Oath it &s;elf: Yes, <HI>Free-thinking</HI> is the Cau&s;e that at this time of day we have &s;o many brave Knights-Errant of the Po&s;t, both Spiritual and Secular,</P>
<Q><L>That eat perfidiou&s;ly their Words,</L>
<L>And &s;wear their Ears thro' two-inch Boards;</L>
<L>Can own the &s;ame thing and di&s;own,</L>
<L>And perjure booty <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI>;</L>
<L>Can make the Go&s;pel &s;erve their turn,</L>
<L>And help them out to be for&s;worn,</L>
<L>When 'tis laid Hands upon and ki&s;s'd,</L>
<L>To be betray'd and &s;old like Chri&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>Thus have I &s;poke to my own Cau&s;e in as few Words as I could. I de&s;ire to dwell a little longer upon my late Friend Mr. <HI>Wycherly</HI>'s. A Gentleman in the Compa|ny was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that the Comedy of the <HI>Country Wife</HI> had not a ju&s;t Foundation, be|cau&s;e, &s;aid he, it was not practicable for <HI>Horner</HI> to make him&s;elf pa&s;s for an Eu|nuch. How! not practicable, when he him&s;elf was at the bottom of the De&s;ign, and had taken &s;o many Precautions to make
<PB N="38" REF="52">
it &s;ucceed? I am &s;o far from being of your Friend's Opinion, that I would lay fifty to one, if I were but capable of &s;uborning half a dozen Ra&s;cals, who &s;hould warmly and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread the Report, that I would make either you or your Friend pa&s;s for <HI>Free-thinkers,</HI> with a con&s;iderable part of the Town, in &s;pight of your utmo&s;t At|tempts to undeceive them. How can that be, you'll &s;ay, when there would be neither Truth nor Probability in &s;uch a Report? But have Truth or Probability any thing to do with the Entertainments of publick Ru|mour? When my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;aid,
<Q><L>There's not a Thing on Earth that I can name</L>
<L>So Fooli&s;h and &s;o Fal&s;e as Common Fame;</L></Q>
did he banter, do you think? or &s;peak it from a thorough Knowledge of the World and of Mankind? There is another of our Poets, who knew Mankind perfectly well, who will tell you the &s;ame thing in Terms that are &s;omething &s;tronger.</P>
<Q><L>The World is naturally aver&s;e</L>
<L>To all the Truth it &s;ees or hears;</L>
<L>But &s;wallows Non&s;en&s;e and a Lie,</L>
<L>With Greedine&s;s and Gluttony.</L>

<P><PB N="39" REF="53">
'Tis true indeed, if the Rabble and Scum of Mankind, of who&s;e Voices pub|lick Rumour is compos'd, had but &s;o much true Sen&s;e as a &s;ober Bea&s;t, why then the Rule that <HI>Horace</HI> has laid down for the Tragick Stage, might do pretty well for the Stage of the World.</P>

<P>But &s;ince the ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e, and &s;o many Ideots will believe that they See what they only Hear; (where as no Dog, no Hor&s;e, nay no A&s;s is Fool enough to let his external Sen&s;e be impos'd upon by his bea&s;tly Imagination;) <HI>Butler</HI> has been &s;o far from thinking that <HI>Horace</HI>'s Rule for the Tragick Stage is proper for the Stage of the World, that he has laid down for the Latter, one which is the very Rever&s;e of the other.</P>
<Q><L>For, like the World, Mens Jobber-noles</L>
<L>Turn round upon their Ears, the Poles;</L>
<L>And what they're confidently told</L>
<L>By no Sen&s;e el&s;e can be controul'd.</L></Q>
<P>What my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and the Author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> have declar'd in their Ver&s;es,
<PB N="40" REF="54">
our Dramatick Poets have endeavour'd to &s;hew upon the Stage, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Eyes of the Rabble of Mankind are downright Cullies to their Ears, and that they ea&s;ily believe that they actually See what they are only impudently Told of: Witne&s;s what pa&s;&s;es between <HI>Vindicius</HI> and old <HI>Brutus,</HI> in the <HI>Junius Brutus</HI> of <HI>Lee</HI>; and between <HI>Hamlet</HI> and <HI>Polonius,</HI> in the <HI>Hamlet</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> which &s;eems to be the original of the other. And has not <HI>Ben,</HI> Learned <HI>Ben,</HI> who is &s;o great a Ma&s;ter of his Art, and con&s;equently of Human life and nature, &s;hewn us the very rever&s;e of this in the Ca|ta&s;trophe of his admirable Alchimi&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;hewn us Per&s;ons who what before they had actually &s;een, are made to believe that they only vainly imagin'd, and for no other Rea|&s;on but becau&s;e they are impudently told that they only vainly imagin'd it.</P>
<P>I tell you then again and again, that I would undertake, if I could but be brought to u&s;e the Means, to make both you and your Friend pa&s;s for Eunuchs, in &s;pight of the Te&s;timony of Twenty Females, who might cry out in Mrs. <HI>Pinchwife</HI>'s Language, they won't &s;ee poor Mr. <HI>Horner</HI> abus'd, for to their certain knowledge&mdash;For tho' that perhaps might undeceive a few, the general Opinion would &s;till remain.

Have they more Under&s;tanding to di&s;cern their true Intere&s;t, and to know that no Man can live happily without living reputably?

<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which are &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of the LIFE of Mr. JOHN CROWN, Author of Sir <HI>Courtly Nice.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now, in compliance with the repeated Reque&s;ts you have made to me, &s;ay &s;omething concerning the E|ducation of Mr. JOHN CROWN, and the mo&s;t remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages of his Life. Mr. CROWN was bred under his Father, an Independant Mini&s;ter, in that part of <HI>Nor|thern America,</HI> which is called <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> But the Vivacity of his Genius made him &s;oon grow impatient of that &s;ullen and gloomy Education, and &s;oon oblig'd him to get loo&s;e from it, and &s;eek his Fortune in <HI>England.</HI> But it was his Fate, at his fir&s;t Arrival here, to happen on an Employment more formal, if po&s;&s;ible, than his <HI>American</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="63">
Education. His Nece&s;&s;ity, upon his fir&s;t Ar|rival here, oblig'd him to become a Gen|tleman-U&s;her to an old Independant Lady. But he &s;oon grew as weary of that pre|ci&s;e Office, as he had been before of the Di&s;cipline of <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> One would think that the&s;e were but indifferent Pre|paratives to the commencing polite Author. But neither the&s;e nor his Poverty, which was great, could oppre&s;s his a&s;piring Spi|rit, a&s;piring to Reputation and Di&s;tinction, rather than to Fortune and Power. His Writings &s;oon made him known to the Court and Town: Yet it was neither to the Favour of the Court, nor of <HI>Wilmot</HI> Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> one of the &s;hining Orna|ments of it, that he was indebted for the Nomination which the King made of him for the writing the Mask of <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> but to the Malice of that noble Lord, who de|&s;ign'd by that Preference to mortify Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> Upon the breaking out of the two Parties, after the Di&s;covery of the Po|pi&s;h Plot, the Favour that he was in at Court, the Gayety of his Youth, and his being unacquainted with true political Prin|ciples, engaged him to embrace the Party of the Tories. About that time he writ <HI>The City Politicks,</HI> on purpo&s;e to Satyrize and expo&s;e the Whigs; a Comedy &s;o agree|able, that it de&s;erv'd to be writ in a much better Cau&s;e: But after he had writ
<PB N="50" REF="64">
it, he met with very great Difficulties in the getting it acted. <HI>Bennet</HI> Lord <HI>Arling|ton,</HI> who was then Lord Chamberlain of the King's Hou&s;hold, and who had &s;ecret|ly e&s;pous'd the Whigs, who were at that time powerful in Parliament, in order to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t the Favour and Power of the Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Danby,</HI> who was his declared Enemy, us'd all his Au|thority to &s;uppre&s;s it. One while it was prohibited on the account of its being Dangerous, another while it was laid a&s;ide on the pretence of its being Flat and In&s;i|pid; till Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> at la&s;t was forc'd to have Recour&s;e to the King him&s;elf, and to engage him to give his ab&s;olute Command to the Lord Chamberlain for the acting of it; which Command the King was pleas'd to give in his own Per&s;on. For that Mo|narch lov'd a Comedy above all Things, (excepting one Thing) and had no mean Opinion of Mr. <HI>Crown</HI>'s Qualifications to &s;ucceed in it. While he was thus in Fa|vour with the King and the Court, I have more than once heard him &s;ay, that tho' he had a &s;incere Affection for the King, he had yet a mortal Aver&s;ion to the Court. The Promi&s;e of a Sum of Money made him &s;ometimes appear there to &s;olicit the Pay|ment of it: But as &s;oon as he had got it, he vani&s;h'd, and continued a long time ab|&s;ent from it, of which, he told me, the
<PB N="51" REF="65">
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> took once Occa|&s;ion to complain to the King; who&s;e way of an&s;wering that Complaint, puts me in mind of a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Boileau</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to <HI>La|moignon.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Hier de vous on parla chez le Roy,</L>
<L>Et d' attentat Horrible on traita la Satire,</L>
<L>Et le Roy que dit il. Le Roy &s;e prit a rire.</L></Q>
<P>It was at the very latter End of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign, that Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> being tyr'd with the Fatigue of Writing, and &s;hock'd by the Uncertainty of Theatrical Succe&s;s, and de&s;irous to &s;helter him&s;elf from the Re&s;entments of tho&s;e numerous Enemies which he had made by his <HI>City Politicks,</HI> made his Application immediately to the King him&s;elf; and de&s;ir'd his Maje&s;ty to e&s;tabli&s;h him in &s;ome Office, that might be a Security to him for Life. The King had the Goodne&s;s to a&s;&s;ure him, he &s;hould have an Office, but added that he would fir&s;t &s;ee another Comedy. Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> endeavour|ing to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by telling the King, that he plotted &s;lowly and awkwardly; the King replyed, that he would help him to a Plot, and &s;o put into his Hands the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Comedy called <HI>Non pued E&s;&s;er.</HI> Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> was oblig'd immediately to go to work upon it; but, after he had writ three Acts of it, found to his Surpri&s;e, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="66">
Play had &s;ome time before been tran&s;lated, and acted, and damn'd, under the Title of <HI>Tarugo</HI>'s <HI>Wiles, or the Coffee-hou&s;e.</HI> Yet, &s;upported by the King's Command, he went boldly on and fini&s;h'd it; and here &s;ee the Influence of a Royal Encourage|ment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Crown,</HI> who had once before ob|lig'd the Commonwealth of Learning with a very agreeable Comedy in his <HI>City Poli|ticks,</HI> yet in Sir <HI>Courtly Nice</HI> went far be|yond it, and infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. For tho' there is &s;omething in the part of <HI>Crack</HI> which borders upon Farce, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Au|thor alone mu&s;t an&s;wer for that. For Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> could not omit the Part of <HI>Crack,</HI> that is of <HI>Tarugo,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Farce depending upon it, without a downright Affront to the King, who had given him that Play for his Ground-work. But all that is of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Growth in Sir <HI>Courtly Nice</HI> is admirable; for tho' we find in it neither the fine De&s;igning of <HI>Ben. John&s;on</HI>; nor the general and ma&s;culine Satyr of <HI>Wy|cherly</HI>; nor that Grace, that Delicacy, nor that Courtly Air which make the Charms of <HI>Etherege</HI>; yet is the Dialogue &s;o lively and &s;o &s;pirited, and &s;o attractively diver&s;i|fied and adapted to the &s;everal Characters; four of tho&s;e Characters are &s;o entirely new, yet &s;o general and &s;o important, are drawn &s;o truly and &s;o graphically, and oppos'd to
<PB N="53" REF="67">
each other, <HI>Surly</HI> to Sir <HI>Courtly</HI> and <HI>Hot|head</HI> to <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> with &s;uch a &s;trong and entire Oppo&s;ition; tho&s;e Extremes of Be|haviour, the one of which is the Grievance, and the other the Plague of Society and Conver&s;ation; exce&s;&s;ive Ceremony on one &s;ide, and on the other &s;ide Rudene&s;s and Brutality, are &s;o finely expos'd in <HI>Surly</HI> and Sir <HI>Courtly</HI>; and tho&s;e Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;ities in the two great Parties of <HI>England,</HI> which have &s;o long di&s;turb'd the publick Quiet, and undermined the pub|lick Intere&s;t, are &s;o happily repre&s;ented and ridicul'd in <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> and <HI>Hothead,</HI> that tho' I have more than twenty times read over this charming Comedy, yet I have al|ways read it, not only with Delight but Rapture. And 'tis my Opinion, that the greate&s;t Comick Poet that ever liv'd in any Age, might have been proud to have been the Author of it.</P>
<P>The Play was now ju&s;t ready to appear to the World; and as every one that had &s;een it rehears'd was highly pleas'd with it; every one who had heard of it was big with the Expectation of it; and Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> was delighted with the flattering Hope of being made happy for the re&s;t of his Life, by the Performance of the King's Promi&s;e; when, upon the very la&s;t Day of the Re|hear&s;al, he met <HI>Cave Underhill</HI> coming from the Play-Hou&s;e as he him&s;elf was go|ing
<PB N="54" REF="68">
towards it: Upon which the Poet re|primanding the Player for neglecting &s;o con&s;iderable a Part as he had in the Co|medy, and neglecting it on a Day of &s;o much Con&s;equence, as the very la&s;t Day of Rehear&s;al: Oh Lord, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Under|hill,</HI> we are all undone. Wherefore, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Crown,</HI> is the Play-Hou&s;e on Fire? The whole Nation, replys the Player, will quickly be &s;o, for the King is dead. At the hearing which di&s;mal Words, the Au|thor was little better; for he who but the Moment before was ravi&s;h'd with the Thought of the Plea&s;ure, which he was about to give to his King, and of the Favours which he was afterwards to re|ceive from him, this Moment found, to his un&s;peakable Sorrow, that his Roy|al Patron was gone for ever, and with him all his Hopes. The King indeed reviv'd from his Apoplectick Fit, but three Days after dyed, and Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> by his Death was replung'd in the deepe&s;t Melancholy.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I given you a &s;hort Ac|count of the Education of Mr. <HI>John Crown,</HI> and of the mo&s;t remarkable Circum&s;tances of his Life, to the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.

<P>BUT, my Lord, as I would not be thought to do a Barbarous thing, I de&s;ire your Grace to believe, that I had powerful
<PB N="56" REF="70">
Motives to engage me to write the&s;e Re|marks. I was attack'd in the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, in the very &s;econd or third, and in &s;everal others. Since your Grace is of opinion that the Au|thor of the Tragedy did not write tho&s;e particular Papers, I am very willing to be|lieve it. But he was in Partner&s;hip with tho&s;e who did. He went &s;hare in the Pro|fits, and more than &s;hare in the Reputa|tion. And Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> dur&s;t not have pro|vok'd me, without his Approbation, or at lea&s;t his Con&s;ent. My Lord, with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to your Grace's Judgment, I am apt to believe, that what Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> did in this Ca&s;e was the Action of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; If a Man who is in Partner&s;hip wrongs me in Trade, all the Partners are involv'd in the Guilt, unle&s;s they di&s;claim it, and &s;ig|nify their Abhorrence of it to the Per&s;on injur'd.

<PB N="57" REF="71">
I may add to this, that it was done at a time when they ba&s;ely took advantage of the great Misfortunes I lay under. My Lord, I appeal to your Grace, if mine is not a more generous Proceeding.

<P>Yet, after all, my Lord, the Satyr of this Critici&s;m (for Rea&s;on is the &s;evere&s;t Satyr in the World, when it is terribly a|gain&s;t a Man) does not fall mo&s;t heavily upon the Author of the Tragedy, it falls mo&s;t &s;everely upon this partial and ta&s;tle&s;s Town.

Now will your Friend Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> murmur, at our Sexes enjoying that Privilege, which you have always claim'd your &s;elves? We have already depos'd one Popi&s;h King for breaking this originnl Contract, and can &s;he expect that we will &s;et up another, who we know is not able to keep it? Would &s;he accept of one for a Husband, whom &s;he knew beforehand to be in a State of Impotence? How then can &s;he pretend that we &s;hould accept of &s;uch a Gover|nour? Is not a Popi&s;h Pretender as much unqualify'd to govern a free-born Prote|&s;tant People, as one in a natural State of Impotence is to give due Benevolence? Are not both Pretenders equally impotent as to what they pretend to?

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the pre&s;ent State of the Stage.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been about to write to you every Po&s;t for the&s;e ten Days, but one Acci|dent or other has &s;till diverted me; but I &s;hall now make more than amends, for <HI>In|gentem tibi Epi&s;tolam Impingam.</HI></P>
<P>If I had had the greate&s;t Inclination imagi|nable to accept of the Invitation which you &s;ent me by your Familiar; yet &s;omething has happen'd which would have been a Ju&s;t, tho' a Ridiculous Impediment. For I had given my word to go another way, in or|der to pull a certain Bea&s;t out of a Ditch, who had fal'n into it, thro' a more than Be&s;tial Stupidity, which engag'd him to look upon things above him, in&s;tead of grazing and following the In&s;tinct of Nature. But
<PB N="62" REF="76">
to &s;peak plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and return to your Invitation; who could have expected any &s;uch thing, from one who had &s;o barba|rou&s;ly abandon'd his old Acquaintance, who had never &s;o much as once in Twenty Years mi&s;s'd an opportunity of &s;erving him, and abandon'd him contrary both to Friend|&s;hip and Politicks. For a Man who de|&s;erts his Friend in an Affair in which 'tis rea|&s;onable that he &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e him, does two Things at once to his own Di&s;advan|tage. For fir&s;t, he &s;hews the World that he has no Body's Intere&s;t at heart but his own, which Indifference the World, as &s;oon as it perceives it, will be &s;ure to return in Kind: Secondly, he gives a pretty convin|cing Proof, that he has not Capacity e|nough to under&s;tand his own Intere&s;t; for he who in any Point that is rea&s;onable is deaf to his Friend's Intere&s;t, is cer|tainly blind to his own. Now what Depen|dance can I have on a Per&s;on who makes it evident to me, that he neither cares for my Intere&s;t, nor under&s;tands his own? If you had laid a&s;ide the Alteration of <HI>Cori|olanus</HI> for better Plays, there had been a plau&s;ible Apology for your Breach of Pro|mi&s;e. But to &s;acrifice me to Fools, was Impudent as 'twas Barbarous. I have read the noble Stuff which you have acted this Winter, all but <HI>Bu&s;iris,</HI> which was not publi&s;h'd when I left the Town. But &s;ome
<PB N="63" REF="77">
Per&s;ons, whom I have &s;een in this place, tell me there is a Rape in it. If that is true, it has a Fault in it for which nothing can make Atonement. A Rape is the peculiar Barbarity of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage. Neither <HI>Greecians</HI> nor <HI>Romans</HI> would &s;uffer it, nor can the <HI>French</HI> at pre&s;ent bear it. The very Apprehen&s;ion of a Rape, tho' the thing did not follow it, damn'd the <HI>Theodore</HI> of <HI>Corneille</HI>; which, if you will believe Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hedelin,</HI> is one of his be&s;t Tra|gedies. I would fain know from you, who have had a twenty Years Experience of the Stage, for what Rea&s;on the Women, who will &s;it as quietly and pa&s;&s;ively at the Re|lation of a Rape in a Tragedy, as if they thought that Ravi&s;hing gave them a Plea|&s;ure, for which they have a ju&s;t Apology, will &s;tart and flinch like unback'd Fillies, at the lea&s;t Approach of <HI>Rem</HI> to <HI>Re</HI> in Co|medy, unle&s;s that Approach happens to be made in the Hou&s;e of Bondage. I have been &s;ometimes apt to entertain a Su&s;picion, that 'tis not the lu&s;cious Matter which di|&s;turbs them in Comedy, but the &s;ecret im|plicite Satire upon the Sex. For a Woman in Comedy never grants the la&s;t Favour to one to whom &s;he is not marry'd, but it proclains the Man's Triumph and her Shame. It always &s;hews her Weakne&s;s and often her Incon&s;tancy, and &s;ometimes her Fraud and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s. But a Rape in
<PB N="64" REF="78">
Tragedy is a Panegyrick upon the Sex: For there the Woman has all the Advantage of the Man. For &s;he is &s;uppos'd to remain innocent, and to be pleas'd without her Con&s;ent; while the Man, who is accounted a damn'd Villain, proclaims the Power of Female Charms, which have the Force to drive him to &s;o horrid a Violence. But to return to the other Plays, which you acted this la&s;t Winter. I have read two Come|dies without one Je&s;t in them. But you will &s;ay, perhaps, that the Play-Hou&s;e was throng'd for eight or ten Days together at the Repre&s;entation of the&s;e Comedies; per|haps &s;o. But then, if it was &s;o throng'd at the Repre&s;entation of damn'd Plays, I hope my Ears will no more be &s;tunn'd with the Noi&s;e of the Improvement of a general Ta&s;te, and that for the future no Con&s;e|quence will be drawn from the Numbers of an Audience to their Capacity. For the very &s;ame Rea&s;on that the Builder's Trade, the Carpenters and the Joyners are &s;o very much improv'd; for the very &s;ame Rea|&s;on that &s;o many fine Hou&s;es, &s;o many beautiful Streets, &s;o many &s;tately Squares, and, as it were, whole Towns are building in your North-We&s;t Suburbs; for that very &s;ame Rea&s;on is your Theatre crowded. A Penetration that comes far &s;hort of Conju|ration, may &s;uffice to &s;hew, that the Num|bers of the Nobility and Gentry of the
<PB N="65" REF="79">
Town, and con&s;equently of their Depend|ants, are exceedingly augmented by &s;ome great Events which have happen'd of late Years, <HI>viz.</HI> the Revolution, the Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Return of our Armies from the Continent, and the King's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown. But as for the Improvement of a general Ta&s;te, 'tis &s;o great a Blunder, that it could never be thought of among con&s;iderate People. 'Tis improv'd in|deed with a vengeance, 'tis refin'd in a glorious manner! improv'd as the Ta&s;te of a Green-&s;ickne&s;s Girl, who leaves pa|latable Meat for Charcoal; refin'd as the Ta&s;te of an Hy&s;terick Woman, who is cheri&s;h'd by a Stink, and &s;ickens at a Per|fume; or as the Ta&s;te of a modern Letcher, who, like a Swine, prefers a Sirreverence to the fine&s;t thing in the World. The in|genious Diver&s;ions, which they follow'd this Winter, their Ma&s;querades, their <HI>Italian</HI> Farces, and their <HI>French</HI> Tumblings, can|not chu&s;e but &s;hew the great Refinement of their Ta&s;te. If the general Ta&s;te were improv'd, two things would certainly fol|low, good Plays would be writ, and damn'd ones would not be endured. But <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plays you will &s;ay were crowded, and <HI>Tom. D'Urfey</HI>'s neglect|ed this Winter. Be it &s;o. I &s;hall &s;hew you in my next, that the Generality of

an Audience, in &s;pight of their Practice, have it both in their Heads and their Hearts, to value <HI>Tom. D'Urfey,</HI> and to de&s;pi&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER written in behalf of one who was lately ruin'd by <HI>Stock-Jobbing,</HI> to his Fa|ther-in-Law who would not &s;ee him.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the third Letter which I have writ to you, without the Satisfaction of receiving an An&s;wer, which has been a great Acce&s;&s;ion to the Calamity which I labour'd under before; and I have felt the Frowns of Fortune the more &s;everely, be|cau&s;e they have been attended with yours. 'Tis hard, that it &s;hou'd be in her Power to alienate not only our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but even the Hearts and Souls of our deare&s;t and mo&s;t valued Friends. As we learn from her hourly Incon&s;tancy, that there is no Man &s;ecure from her Power, methinks it &s;hould be the common Intere&s;t of Man|kind to alleviate her Strokes by u&s;ing their Fellow-Creatures gently, while they are un|der her Di&s;grace; e&s;pecially &s;ince long Ex|perience has taught us, that &s;he is often the
<PB N="68" REF="82">
mo&s;t barbarous to tho&s;e who de&s;erve her Cruelty the lea&s;t; &s;o that her Per&s;ecution be|ing for the mo&s;t part directly contrary to Rea&s;on, &s;hould lea&s;t of all be abetted by rea&s;onable Men like you. My Intentions have been very good, tho' the Event has not been an&s;werable to them; and methinks when we pa&s;s a Judgment upon our Neigh|bours, not by their Intentions, but by E|vents, we pa&s;s a &s;evere Law again&s;t our+&s;elves, becau&s;e our Intentions are in our Power, but Events are not; and no Man can fore&s;ee the future. My very Enemies mu&s;t confe&s;s, that my Calamity has pro|ceeded not from any Extravagance of Tem|per, or a luxurious Life, but only from the too eager De&s;ire of Getting; which, if it be a Fault, who at pre&s;ent is guiltle&s;s? Sure no Man ever was ju&s;tly blam'd for catching a Di&s;temper, who&s;e Infection was epidemi|cal. And yet that very eager De&s;ire of Getting has not proceeded from any &s;or|did Avarice, but only from my Exce&s;s of Love to your Daughter, and an earne&s;t Zeal to &s;ecure her Happine&s;s before I &s;hould be prevented by Sickne&s;s or Death, or that u&s;ual Change which attends on Hu|man Affairs. So that my Eagerne&s;s to make your Daughter happy, has been the very thing that has made her mi&s;erable by bring|ing under her Father's Di&s;plea&s;ure one for whom &s;he believes it her Duty to be concern'd
<PB N="89" REF="83">
So that what &s;he &s;uffers by your Di&s;plea&s;ure cau&s;es it to be more grievous to me, and makes me more pa&s;&s;ionately and impatiently de&s;ire that you would be reconcil'd to me. My Fault has been my Error and not my Crime, and I have Youth, and Health, and Vigour of Mind enough to retrieve my Fortune. And when I have retriev'd her, I have Rea&s;on to believe, that &s;he will then be con&s;tant to me, becau&s;e I have &s;een and experienc'd the only Error which could have oblig'd her to leave me; and therefore as &s;oon as I am re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd, I &s;hall be more happy becau&s;e more &s;ecure than if I had never falln. In the mean while, Sir, to give you a convincing Proof, that I prefer your Daughter's Happine&s;s to my own, I am willing to do any thing to &s;ecure her a Competency while my own Condi|tion is doubtful. I am willing to put it as much out of my Power, as it is contrary to my Inclinations, to touch the other two thou&s;and Pounds.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Degeneracy of the Publick Ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABout the middle of the la&s;t Month I &s;ent you a long Letter, in which I endeavour'd to &s;hew the Extravagance of that Opinion, that there is at this time a|mong us an Improvement of the general Ta&s;te, with relation to Poetry and the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> And I promis'd in my next to &s;hew the Error or the Falacy of tho&s;e, who pretend to maintain that Opinion from the crowded Audiences at the Repre&s;en|tation of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plays, and the thin ones at tho&s;e which were writ by Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y.</HI> I promis'd to &s;hew that notwith|&s;tanding this Practice of the pre&s;ent Fre|quenters of the Play-Hou&s;e, they have it both in their Heads and their Hearts to value Mr. <HI>D'Urfey</HI> and to de&s;pi&s;e <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> that neither their Approbation nor their Contempt is their own, but a&s;&s;umed and borrowed, and that they approve by
<PB N="71" REF="85">
Vogue and by Fa&s;hion, as a late noble Poet has told us.</P>
<Q><L>Their private Wi&s;h obey the publick Voice,</L>
<L>'Twixt Good and Bad Whim&s;ey decides, not Choice;</L>
<L>Fa&s;hions grow up for Ta&s;te, at Forms they &s;trike,</L>
<L>They know what they would have, not what they like.</L></Q>
<P>I promis'd to &s;hew, that the one of the&s;e Authors has been e&s;teem'd, and the other contemn'd by Men of Sen&s;e &s;o long, that the Approbation of the one, and the Contempt of the other, is come at la&s;t to make an Impre&s;&s;ion on the Rabble; when I mention that Word, I do not mean &s;uch a Rabble as you have &s;ometimes on the Stage at <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> or at <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> but &s;uch a Rabble as is but too often be|held in your Pit and Side-Boxes.</P>
<P>A very great Part of tho&s;e who pretend to be in Love with <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> if he were now living, and his mo&s;t celebrated Plays were to be acted <HI>De novo,</HI> without a Cabal, without Character or Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, wou'd Hi&s;s and Damn the very Things of which they are now the fa&s;hionable Admirers, which &s;eems plain to me from this very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the modern Plays which they mo&s;t approve of, are the very Rever&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="86">
of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, with re&s;pect either to his Excellencies or his Faults.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is very ju&s;tly celebrated for the Truth and Ju&s;tne&s;s of his Cha|racters, for the Beauty of his Sentiments, for the Simplicity and Dignity of his Dia|logue, and for his moving the Pa&s;&s;ions pow|erfully by the meer force of Nature. But the pre&s;ent Spectators of Tragedies ap|prove of tho&s;e mo&s;t, in which the Pa&s;&s;ions are mov'd lea&s;t. They will endure no Mo|dern Tragedy, in who&s;e principal Chara|cter Love is not the predominant Quality. Now Love predominating in the principal Character, too often fal&s;ifies and confounds tho&s;e Characters, and by Con&s;equence but too often de&s;troys the Beauty of the Sen|timents, becau&s;e no Sentiment can be beau|tiful, which is improper in him who &s;peaks it. Be&s;ides, there are not three of our mo|dern Tragedies, which have any thing like tho&s;e Sentiments which abound in <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>; Sentiments, which, at the &s;ame time that they &s;hew Sagacity and Penetration, are ea&s;ie, ju&s;t, and natural.</P>
<P>The modern Readers and Spectators of Tragedies will endure no Tragedy which has the Simplicity and <HI>naivet&eacute;</HI> of <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s Dialogue; a Simplicity, wherever the occa&s;ion requires it, attended with Force, and Dignity, and Pomp, and Solem|nity: In&s;tead of that noble and natural Di|alogue,
<PB N="73" REF="87">
they are for a flatulant Style, in which the Poet puts the Change upon him|&s;elf, and &s;peaks almo&s;t always him&s;elf, in|&s;tead of making his Characters &s;peak.</P>
<P>But as the Readers and Spectators of Modern Tragedies approve of tho&s;e mo&s;t, which are the very rever&s;e of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s with re&s;pect to his Beauties and Excellen|cies, &s;o they declare very loudly again&s;t his Faults. The Faults of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> which are rather tho&s;e of the Age in which he liv'd, are his perpetual Rambles, and his apparent Duplicity in &s;ome of his Plays, or Triplicity of Action, and the frequent breaking the Continuity of the Scenes. The pre&s;ent Spectators declare again&s;t this, in appearance, but at the &s;ame time ap|prove of this Multiplicity of Action in &s;ome Modern Plays, concealed by a Jumble and a Confu&s;ion which is incomprehen&s;ible and altogether unintelligible. Another of <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s Faults is the Length of Time em|ploy'd in the carrying on his Dramatick Action. The pre&s;ent Spectators are ex|treamly &s;hock'd at this in a modern Trage|dy, but at the &s;ame time approve of tho&s;e in which the Unity of Time is pre&s;erved by offending all Common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>If a Modern Poet in one of his Trage|dies &s;hould &s;hew any Thing like <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Rambles, &s;hould introduce a Tragedy up|on the Stage, which &s;hould begin in <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="88">
and end in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> like the Moor of <HI>Venice,</HI> that Play would be exploded and damn'd with very great Damnation. But the Modern Spectators of Tragedies great|ly e&s;teem and are fond of tho&s;e, in which the Unity of Place is pre&s;erv'd, &s;ometimes by whim&s;ical comick Ab&s;urdities, and &s;ometimes by dreadful and prodigious Ex|travagancies.</P>
<P>From all this I conclude, as I &s;aid be|fore, that the Spectators of modern Tra|gedies, having the greate&s;t E&s;teem for tho&s;e, which have lea&s;t of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Excellen|cies, and declaring loudly again&s;t his Faults, would damn <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> if living.</P>
<P>Nor can I believe that &s;everal who pre|tend to be pa&s;&s;ionate Admirers of <HI>Milton,</HI> would treat him if living in any other man|ner for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e they are &s;o fond of nothing as of that &s;oft and effeminate Rhyme, which makes the very Rever&s;e of the Harmony, and of the manly, and powerful, and noble Enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>Becau&s;e the Generality of Poets and Wits his Contemporaries did not e&s;teem him, tho' they were by no means inferior in Under&s;tanding to his pretended living Admirers. <HI>Willmot</HI> Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> ne|ver &s;o much as mention'd him, in his Imi|tation of the Tenth Satyr of the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Horace.</HI> When he came to imitate that
<PB N="75" REF="89">
Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Forte epos Acer, ut nemo Varius du|cit,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Milton</HI> he names <HI>Waller.</HI> And when that noble Peer was &s;ome Years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">erwards ask'd by Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> &s;ince Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> for which of the Mo|dern Poets he had mo&s;t E&s;teem, he an|&s;wer'd without the lea&s;t He&s;itation, for <HI>Boileau</HI> among the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Cowley</HI> a|mong the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets. Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> in his fir&s;t Book of Critici&s;m treated the <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> with Contempt, and the gene|rality of the Readers of Poetry, for twen|ty Years after it was publi&s;hed, knew no more of that exalted Poem, than if it had been writ in <HI>Arabick:</HI> Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in his Preface before <HI>the State of Innocence,</HI> ap|pears to have been the fir&s;t, tho&s;e Gentle|men excepted who&s;e Ver&s;es are before <HI>Mil|ton</HI>'s Poem, who di&s;cover'd in &s;o publick a Manner an extraordinary Opinion of <HI>Milton</HI>'s extraordinary Merit. And yet Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> at that time knew not half the Extent of his Excellence, as more than twenty Years afterwards he confe&s;s'd to me, and as is pretty plain from his writing <HI>the State of Innocence.</HI> For Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> in that Poem, which is founded on the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> falls &s;o infinitely &s;hort of tho&s;e wonderful Qualities, by which <HI>Milton</HI> has di&s;tingui&s;h'd that noble Poem from all other Poems, that one of the&s;e two Things mu&s;t be granted; either that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> knew
<PB N="76" REF="90">
not the Extent of <HI>Milton</HI>'s great Qualities, or that he de&s;ign'd to be a Foil to him. But they who knew Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> know very well, that he was not of a Temper to de|&s;ign to be a Foil to any one.</P>
<P>I hope I have &s;aid enough to convince you that the Approbations and Cen&s;ures of the Generality of an Audience are deriv'd from Sentiments which are not their own, and which are the Effects of Authority, and not of Rea&s;on. When Men who are, and are e&s;teem'd, Per&s;ons of more than or|dinary Judgment, have declar'd them&s;elves from time to time, during a Century, or half a Century, concerning Poems Dra|matick or others, tho&s;e Declarations are the Cau&s;e, that other Per&s;ons at length, being guided by the Light which is held out to them, fondly imagine that it was kindled by that Particle of Heav'nly Fire which they fancy to be within them. But the numerous and violent Cabals, which are form'd to &s;upport or decry Dramatick Wri|tings, may &s;erve in&s;tead of a thou&s;and Ar|guments to convince the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, that there is no &s;uch thing as a general Ta&s;te among us. It being ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that great Numbers of Per&s;ons of a fine Di&s;cernment and a true Ta&s;te &s;hould con|&s;pire to extol a Blockhead at the Expence of a noble Art, at the Expence of their own Reputation and the Reputation of their

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Declaring the Rea&s;ons for which I pub|li&s;h'd the two Volumes of SELECT WORKS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here &s;end you by the Bearer, &s;everal Pieces in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, writ for|merly by me, and lately printed in two Volumes; but I &s;end them not without a double De&s;ign on you. For fir&s;t, I de&s;ire that you wou'd have the Goodne&s;s to oblige your Managers to make me &s;ome Recom|pence this Winter for the Wrong which they did me the la&s;t. Secondly, I de&s;ire that you will give me leave to &s;ay &s;omething concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Pieces contain'd in the&s;e two Volumes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd more particularly concerning the Mo|tive which oblig'd me to write the chief of them at the fir&s;t, and to publi&s;h them lately together; which I &s;hall do with Plea|&s;ure
<PB N="82" REF="96">
to one who has done &s;o much Good in the &s;ame Cau&s;e in which mo&s;t of them were writ.</P>
<P>Several of the Pieces in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, and three of the Plays, were writ in the Cau&s;e of Liberty. The narrative Poems of greater Length were all of them written upon Great and Publick Occa&s;ions, and were de&s;ign'd as &s;o many Panegyricks upon tho&s;e Illu&s;trious Per&s;ons who&s;eGreat and Heroick Actions had made them Benefactors to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and Liberty.</P>
<P>It has always been my Opinion, that a free Nation can never be too zealous in maintaining their Liberties, becau&s;e we have been taught by too many fatal Events, that they have at la&s;t been often lo&s;t by the Security and Corruptions of tho&s;e who had for &s;everal Centuries enjoy'd them. Wit|ne&s;s the ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> and the ancient and modern <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> But whenever the Liberties of a great Nation are in manife&s;t Danger, there all the &s;everal Members of it, who are not abjectly ba&s;e, will u&s;e their utmo&s;t Efforts in defending them. The Liberties of <HI>Great Britain</HI> have in our own Memory been in &s;o much Danger, that they have been twice in thirty Years retrieved from immediate Ruin, fir&s;t by the Revolution, and &s;econd|ly by the Acce&s;&s;ion of King <HI>George</HI> to the Imperial Crown of this I&s;land, but even
<PB N="83" REF="97">
now they by no Means appear to me to be entirely &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P>Since the Revolution, things appear to have been &s;trangely rever&s;t in <HI>Great Britain</HI> with regard to Liberty. In four or five Reigns immediately preceding the Arrival of King <HI>William</HI> of Immortal Memory, the Court was for Arbitrary Power, and the People appear'd &s;trenuous for Liberty. But &s;ince that time, the Court has for the mo&s;t part contended for Liberty, and the People, I mean too great a Part of them, have declar'd for Slavery. Now, if ever we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hould come to be under a King, who wou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">acrifice his Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting Subjects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the High-Church Clergy, we &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uickly &s;ee whether the Liberties of a Na|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">on are mo&s;t &s;ecure, when a con&s;iderable Part of the People (who are their natural Guardians) are re&s;ov'd to defend, or deter|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">in'd to re&s;ign them. In the mean time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, to the im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ortal Honour of the pre&s;ent King, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavouring to &s;ecure the Di&s;&s;enters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">om &s;uch a Treatment in time to come, he taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t effectual Method to im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ortalize Liberty.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I acquainted you with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> only Motive of writing the chief of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;e Poems, which was the Apprehen&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">had of the Danger, which the Liberties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> my Country were in, and con&s;equently
<PB N="84" REF="98">
the Liberties of the Chri&s;tian World, of which ours are the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwark. I wrote them not then as one who e&s;pous'd a Party, but as a Lover of my Country, and one zealous to promote the Happine&s;s of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I have been &s;o far from having any ambitious Aims or any &s;ordid Views of Intere&s;t, that I have been con|tented to &s;ee &s;everal of the publick Rewards engro&s;s'd by &s;ome who are luke-warm, and by others who are <HI>Jacobites</HI> in Whig Cloathing, while I have remain'd very poor in a very advanc'd Age. But one Thing indeed I have &s;ometimes been apt to think exceeding hard, and that is, that the&s;e lukewarm Per&s;ons, and the&s;e <HI>Jacobites</HI> in Whig Cloathing, &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to make u&s;e of the Power which they have acquir'd by their Fal&s;hood, to the utter Ruin of one who has behav'd him&s;elf all along with the utmo&s;t Sincerity in the noble&s;t Cau&s;e of Li|berty.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I laid before you the Motive which engag'd me to write the greater part of the Pieces which are con|tain'd in the two Volumes. I &s;hall now &s;hew you, how the &s;ame Motive oblig'd me to u&s;e my Endeavours to pre&s;erve them&punc; if they &s;hould appear worthy of it, and con|&s;equently to publi&s;h them in the two fore+mention'd Volumes. It was in <HI>October</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="99">
1716, that I de&s;ir'd a Book&s;eller to collect them for me. I thought that after &s;o much Time had pa&s;s'd &s;ince the writing them, I &s;hould be capable of forming as true a Judg|ment my &s;elf of them, as any other Per&s;on what&s;oever, who has no better Judgment in Poetical Matters than I have, or that the Precept of <HI>Horace, nonum prematur in annum,</HI> mu&s;t be fal&s;e and vain.</P>
<P>Upon a very &s;low and deliberate Peru&s;al of them, I could not but conclude, that with all their Faults they were not altoge|ther depriv'd of that noble Fire, which a|lone can make them plea&s;ing; nor of that Ju&s;tne&s;s and Solidity which alone can make them la&s;ting. I believ'd that if they were publi&s;h'd together, they might be able one Day to do &s;ome Good to the publick, and no Di&s;credit to me.</P>
<P>And I was the more encourag'd to ven|ture on this Publication, becau&s;e, Sir, you may be pleas'd to remember, that they had been favourably receiv'd by the mo&s;t illu|&s;trious Per&s;ons of both Parties for their Judgment in Poetry, and their Knowledge of the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> by the late Earls of <HI>Godolphin</HI> and <HI>Halifax,</HI> Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> and others among the Whigs, and by the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and my Lord <HI>Lan&s;down</HI> among the Tories. And if any Temptation could make me vain, it would
<PB N="86" REF="100">
be the favourable Opinions of the la&s;t two Noble Per&s;ons, becau&s;e as their Judgments in matters of Poetry are unque&s;tion'd, they can never be &s;uppos'd to be partial to one, who has all his Life-time appear'd very zealous in contrary Principles to tho&s;e of a Party, which they by &s;ome have been &s;up|pos'd to favour. My Lord <HI>Lan&s;down,</HI> by making me a Pre&s;ent &s;o noble, as never has been made by a Subject to any Author now living, &s;ufficiently declar'd that what I had writ had not been altogether di&s;plea&s;ing to him. And 'tis to the warm Approbation which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave to the Poem on the Battel of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> that I owe the Honour of being fir&s;t known to the late illu&s;trious Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> who&s;e good and great Qualities, and the Benefits which <HI>Great Britain</HI> receiv'd from his good and his wi&s;e Admini&s;tration, make me proud to own for the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of my Benefactors.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I found Encouragement to pre&s;erve the&s;e Pieces, and e&s;pecially the Poems writ in the Cau&s;e of Liberty. But I was convinc'd at the &s;ame time, that the only way to pre&s;erve them would be to publi&s;h them together. They were in a great many different Hands, and &s;ome of them in the Hands of &s;uch who were mor|tal Enemies to the Cau&s;e in which they
<PB N="87" REF="101">
were written. Some of them had been very incorrectly printed. The very Subject which ought to recommend them to all <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> as well as the Harmony with|out Rhyme in &s;everal of the Poems, made &s;ome of them for the pre&s;ent le&s;s plea&s;ing to above half the Readers of Poetry. Some of them that had once appear'd with Applau&s;e &s;eem'd to have been forgot. For all things of late Days have been manag'd by Cabal and Party; and there &s;eems to have been a Con&s;piracy in the Commonwealth of Learning, among Fools of all Sorts, to ex|alt Folly at the Expence of Common-&s;en&s;e, and make Stupidity triumph over Me|rit in the very Dominions of Wit, which has been one of the Cau&s;es why Things are reduced to that deplorable State upon our <HI>Briti&s;h Parna&s;&s;us. Apollo</HI> and the Mu&s;es &s;eem to have abandon'd it; di&s;daining that their Divinities &s;hould honour a Place with their Songs, where Fools and Pedants, Buffoons, Eunuchs and Tumblers have &s;o often met with Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Who could have thought, if he had been told twenty Years ago, that he &s;hould out|live Tragedy and Comedy, that he had been promis'd a Life of not quite twenty Years? Yet 'tis very plain that the Pro|mi&s;e had extended no further: &s;uch is the Power of Cabal and Party.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="102">
I have all along had a great Aver&s;ion to the making a Party, or the entring into a Cabal, and have &s;ometimes look'd upon it with Horrour and &s;ometimes with Con|tempt. Who that has Common-&s;en&s;e can forbear laughing, when he &s;ees a Parcel of Fellows, who call them&s;elves Wits, &s;it in Combination round a Coffee Table, as Sharpers do round a Hazard Table, to trick hone&s;t Gentlemen into an Approba|tion of their Works, and bubble them of their Under&s;tandings?</P>
<P>And yet I have all along known, that no|thing in the greater Poetry can grow im|mediately popular without a Cabal or Party. I have a long time been convinced, that the more &s;ublimely any thing is writ in Poetry, and the nearer it comes to Perfe|ction, the longer it will be before it grows popular, without &s;uch a Cabal; becau&s;e the more &s;ublimely it is writ, and the nearer it comes to Perfection, the more it is rais'd above the Apprehen&s;ions of the Vulgar. And yet notwith&s;tanding this Knowledge, I have all along re&s;olv'd to have no Repu|tation, or to owe it to my Writings.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you &s;ee the Rea&s;ons, why the Writings that make up the&s;e two Vo|lumes, or at lea&s;t the greater Part of them, had been in danger of being lo&s;t, if I had not taken Pains during my Life-time to correct and publi&s;h them together. There
<PB N="89" REF="103">
is one more Rea&s;on remaining, and that is, the Malice of tho&s;e People whom the World calls Poets, who&s;e Hatred I have been proud to incur, by &s;peaking bold and nece&s;&s;ary Truths in the behalf of a noble Art, which they have mi&s;erably abus'd by their vile Poems, and their more vile Cri|tici&s;ms. And yet 'tis from the&s;e People that the fooli&s;h Readers of Poetry, which are nine Parts in ten, take their Opinions of Poets and their Works, little believing, or once imagining, that the&s;e Per&s;ons are of all Mankind the very wor&s;t qualify'd to judge of their own Art; as having nei|ther the Capacity, nor the Impartiality which are requi&s;ite for the judging truly. For it will be found, generally &s;peaking, that Poets, Painters, and Mu&s;icians, are capacitated le&s;s than other Men to judge of Poetry, Painting and Mu&s;ick. This, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, may appear to &s;ome to be &s;o bold a Paradox, that I &s;hall endeavour to make it out both by Rea&s;on and Authority, tho' I know very well at the &s;ame time, that You can make no Doubt of it. The Generality of Poets, Painters and Mu&s;ici|ans, are &s;uch by the meer Power of a warm Imagination. And 'tis very rarely that a &s;trong Imagination and a penetrating Judg|ment are found in the &s;ame Subject. We need go no further than <HI>Boileau</HI> to hear
<PB N="90" REF="104">
that a celebrated Poet is often a contemp|tible Judge.</P>
<Q><L>Tel excelle a Rimer qui Juge &s;ottement,</L>
<L>Et tel s'e&s;t fait par &s;es Vers di&s;tinguer par la ville,</L>
<L>Qui jamais du Lucain n'a di&s;tingue Virgile.</L></Q>
<P>As for what relates to Painters, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with the Citation of a Re|mark from the ingenious and judicious Author of the Ob&s;ervations upon <HI>Fre&s;noy</HI>'s Art of Painting, tran&s;lated by Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> 'Tis the Fiftieth Remark, upon the&s;e Words of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Tran&s;lation, 'As being the 'Sovereign Judge of his own Art.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">This Word, Sovereign Judge or Arbiter of his own Art, pre-&s;uppo&s;es a Painter to be fully in&s;tructed in all the Parts of Paint|ing, &s;o that being &s;et as it were above his Art, he may be the Ma&s;ter and Sovereign of it, which is no ea&s;ie Matter. Tho&s;e of that Profe&s;&s;ion are &s;o &s;eldom endow'd with that &s;upream Capacity, that few of them arrive to be good Judges of Painting: And I &s;hould many times make more account of their Judgment who are Men of Sen&s;e, and yet have never touch'd a Pencil, than of the Opinion which is given by the greate&s;t part of Painters. All Painters therefore may be call'd Arbiters of their own Art, but to
<PB N="91" REF="105">
be Sovereign Arbiters belongs only to know|ing Painters.</Q></P>
<P>What is &s;aid by this ingenious Gentle|man of Painters, is exactly true of Mu&s;ici|ans. For which I have the Opinion of more than one Ma&s;ter among them; and as to the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation with relati|on to Poets, I have &s;aid enough above.</P>
<P>But as Poets are not capable, &s;o neither are they impartial Judges. I &s;peak of tho&s;e who are only Rhime&s;ters. For a great Ma&s;ter is for the mo&s;t part as impartial as he is knowing; but for the re&s;t, the Readers of Poetry would do well to con&s;ider, that if a Mi&s;tre&s;s who is courted by a great ma|ny pa&s;&s;ionate Rivals, &s;hould ask any one of them his Opinion of the re&s;t, 'tis ten to one that he would prefer him mo&s;t, whom he e&s;teem'd lea&s;t, and whom he believ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t capable of getting that Mi&s;tre&s;s from him.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I acquainted you with the Motive which oblig'd me to write the greater Part of the&s;e Treati&s;es, and which afterwards engag'd me to publi&s;h them in the two Volumes, which you will receive with this. I hope I &s;hall not be thought trouble&s;ome, if in a &s;econd Letter I &s;ay &s;omething in particular of the Pieces both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e. However the&s;e two Letters will at lea&s;t convince you of the

<P>I Had &s;ooner returned you my Thanks for the favour of your la&s;t, and the good Advice in it, if I had not entertain'd &s;ome Thoughts of waiting on you; which I had certainly done before now, if it had not been for the Reflection, that here of late you are &s;carce any where to be found but in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>; and what good Chri&s;ti|an would go to a Place where he is &s;ure to meet the Devil at every Turn that he takes there? not indeed with his Infernal Equi|page, his Brow-antlers, his Saucer Eyes, his long Tail, and his cloven Feet: He wears nothing of all this in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> except &s;ometimes his Horns.

You know, &s;aid he, that there are two con&s;tant Ha|zard Tables or Wheels of Fortune that are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Authority in this wicked Town, not to mention a third, which is &s;ometimes at <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> but tran&s;itory and occa&s;ional; that one of the&s;e two is in the neighbourhood of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Authority of the Court, and the other near the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd by a|nother Authority. Now the Table in the Neighbourhood of <HI>White-Hall</HI> is a fair and impartial one, at which only Men of Ho|nour
<PB N="95" REF="109">
play; at lea&s;t they are Men of Ho|nour while they are there, whatever they may be when they are in other Places. But the Hazard Table near the <HI>Exchange</HI> is frequented by the greate&s;t Sharpers about this tricking Town. There are Bullies to be &s;een every Day in Crowds with their Boxes and their fal&s;e Dice: &s;ometimes they make u&s;e of High Runners, &s;ometimes of Low Runners, and &s;ometimes of Doctors. And this their Sharping and their Cheat|ing is Chri&s;ten'd for&s;ooth their Being in the Secret. So that Being in the Secret will &s;hortly come to &s;ignifie &s;omething more &s;candalous even than open Infamy.</P>
<P>Well but, &s;aid I, even at that tricking Table, my Friend plays upon the Square, and is in no Secret. But then, &s;aid he, let me ask you another Que&s;tion, Is your Friend a Lover of his Country? That is a &s;tranger Que&s;tion than the other, &s;aid I. Every one is a Lover of his Country, or at lea&s;t every one pretends to be &s;o. But, replyed he, can any one who would be &s;o much as thought to love his Country ap|prove &s;o heartily of a Method, which if 'tis practi&s;ed much longer will infallibly ruin it? For be&s;ides that Strangers run away with va&s;t Sums of our Money, who came in at Seventy perhaps, and go out at Seven Hundred; is not our Trade by this Stock-Jobbing brought to a narrower Com|pa&s;s?
<PB N="96" REF="110">
They who are ruin'd by it are un|able to carry on their Commerce; and they who have gain'd va&s;t Sums by it, have been apt to think them&s;elves above their Pro|fe&s;&s;ions, and laugh at the getting ten or twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> by a long Voyage, when in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> they can propo&s;e to gain fifty <HI>per Cent.</HI> in a Morning. Now as our Trade decrea&s;es, continued he, our Seamen mu&s;t decrea&s;e proportionably, &s;o that at la&s;t perhaps it will be impo&s;&s;ible upon an exigence to Man our Royal Navy: And then we may happen to become a Prey to the fir&s;t Invader. So that this Lover of his Country is heartily approving of a Method, which may one Day bring this I&s;land to be a conquered Province, and his own Po&s;terity to be wretched Slaves. As &s;oon as I perceived that he paus'd, I told him that this would have been more <HI>a pro|pos,</HI> if he had &s;poke it before the late Act of Parliament for the putting down of the Bub|bles. But he an&s;wer'd they being put down by the Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature, for this very Rea&s;on, lea&s;t any Prejudice &s;hould acrue to Trade from them, and <HI>Ram</HI>'s and <HI>On&s;low</HI>'s Bubbles being e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the &s;ame Wi&s;dom, have not the Legi&s;lature plainly declared, that Trade could receive no Damage from them; and that we may deliver to the Winds our fears of Conque&s;t and of Slavery? Ought not every one to
<PB N="97" REF="111">
acquie&s;ce in what they have done, and can any one be extravagant enough to believe, that they would e&s;tabli&s;h two Bubbles again&s;t the Publick Good, only for the &s;ake of a little tran&s;itory Pelf, which is to come in|to particular Hands? Very good, &s;aid my Friend but are not tho&s;e Gentle|men who con&s;tantly frequent <HI>Exchange-Ally</HI> actually Slaves already, as errant, as vile, as mi&s;erable Slaves as tho&s;e who rowe in the Galleys? Say'&s;t thou &s;o, my dear Friend? &s;aid I: do but make that out, and thou &s;halt to me be <HI>Apollo</HI> and all the Mu&s;es. But this is a new Paradox. Not &s;o new neither, &s;aid he. The whole Sect of the Stoicks embraced it. The Stoicks, I told him, were fanta&s;tical People. In &s;ome things he allow'd they were &s;o; but that, for the mo&s;t part, their Morality was more &s;ound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">han that of any other Sect among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Heathens. <HI>Horace,</HI> who was of no Sect, but who took from each of them what he thought was ju&s;t and &s;olid, (and by the way he wanted no Judgment, no Di&s;cernment that could enable him to make a right Choice,) made this Opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">is own, as you may &s;ee by the Sixteenth Epi&s;tle of his Fir&s;t Book.</P>

<P>But my dear Friend, &s;aid I, the Autho|rity of a <HI>Roman</HI> Poet will hardly bring the Gentlemen in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> off from their Stock-Jobbing. This is an Authori|ty, he reply'd, which carries Rea&s;on along with it. For thus he argues. The Cove|tous Man de&s;ires; he who de&s;ires, of con|&s;equence fears; but he who lives in conti|nual Fear, mu&s;t, in my Opinion, be always an errant Slave. But, continued he, I will add my own Rea&s;ons to tho&s;e of <HI>Horace.</HI> There are two &s;orts of Liberties, &s;aid he, a Civil and a Philo&s;ophical Liberty. What we call Civil Liberty gives us the com|mand of our own Actions: What we call Philo&s;ophical Liberty gives us the com|mand of our own Thoughts. Now nei|ther the Galley-&s;lave nor the Stock-Job|be can be &s;aid to enjoy Civil Liberty, that is, neither the one nor the other has the free|dom of his own Actions: For a Galley|Slave mu&s;t Row, and a Stock-Jobber mu&s;t Stock-Jobb. And it &s;ignifies nothing to the purpo&s;e, that the one, upon his Refu&s;al or upon his Neglect, is corrected by a Cat of Nine-tayls, and the other by the Stings of his own ba&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ince they are both
<PB N="99" REF="113">
equally under Compul&s;ion; and the Stock-Jobber, though never &s;o wealthy, is as much afraid of mi&s;&s;ing the Hours of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s or of <HI>Garroway</HI>'s, as the poor Galley-&s;lave is of being wanting to his turn at the Oar. But now to come to Philo&s;ophical Liber|ty, in that the Galley-&s;lave has infinitely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Advantage of the Stock-Jobber. For while the former is chain'd to his Oar, his Thoughts may be as free as the Air, his Thoughts may wander o'er the Uni|ver&s;e, may wander through Eternity, and while his Body is in the utmo&s;t Agitation, his Mind may be calm and compos'd. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e Stock-Jobber's Thoughts are more con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">in'd than the other's Body, confin'd to Dirt, and the &s;ordid means of accumula|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng it, and his Mind is often plagu'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he mo&s;t tormentiug Pa&s;&s;ions.

his Po&s;t, the noble Po&s;t of Virtue where his General placed him, and which it was his Duty to maintain at the Expence of Life it &s;elf. He has lo&s;t it, he has been beaten out of it, by his ba&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions and by his abject Vices, by his Fraud, his De|&s;ire, his Hope, his Fear and his Rage. The Galley-&s;lave may have it firmly in his Mind and in his Will to do all the Duties of the be&s;t of Men; to be a faithful Lover of his Country and to &s;erve it to the utmo&s;t of his power; to be a good Father, a good Son, a good Husband, a good Bro|ther, he may be dear to all his Friends and Relations, and have the heartie&s;t kinde&s;t Wi&s;hes of all. But as the mi&s;erable Stock-Jobber cares only for him&s;elf, he is dear to him&s;elf alone, and contemptible and hateful to all be&s;ides; and one may &s;ay to him, in the Words of <HI>Horace,</HI></P>

<P>For a true Stock-Jobber will &s;acrifice Wife, Father, Child, Brother, and his Coun|try it &s;elf, for Gain. He who &s;acrifice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="101" REF="115">
the latter will &s;acrifice the re&s;t. And have we not a thou&s;and In&s;tances every Day that a Stock-Jobber will &s;acrifice his Country?</P>
<P>But there is &s;till another thing in which the Galley-&s;lave has by much the Advan|tage of the Stock-Jobber. The former is a redeemable Slave, but the latter is in Chains for his Life. Fortune or Time may relea&s;e the Slaves who are at <HI>Algiers</HI> or <HI>Tripoli,</HI> but Fortune and Time are both the Stock-Jobbers Foes. Length of Days will certainly augment his Avarice and make his Captivity ruder. And the more Wealth there &s;hall chance to flow in upon him, the more will he de&s;ire, the le&s;s will he enjoy, and &s;till the more abject a Slave will he be to the ba&s;e Lu&s;t of Gold. But, my dear Friend, &s;aid I, who had heard him hitherto with Patience, Thou certain|ly believ'&s;t that thou art in a Pulpit, for it is there that, right or wrong, a Man has the Pri|viledge of talking for an Hour without be|ing interrupted. Sir, &s;aid he, I &s;tand cor|rected, but I did not de&s;erve this Remon|&s;trance only for complying with your own De&s;ire. You know very well that 'tis not my cu&s;tom to talk all, and that I have more than once &s;uffered you to Preach in your turn. No Man, he continued, has a wor&s;e Opinion than I have of an eternal Talker. That which makes him &s;o in&s;uf|ferable,
<PB N="102" REF="116">
is, that tho' he is for the mo&s;t part a very empty Coxcomb, yet he implicitely declares that, into what Company &s;oever he lights, he alone has more Under&s;tand|ing than all the re&s;t of the Company to|gether; that Nature has qualified him to pre&s;cribe to others, and that God who made him created him perpetual Dictator. But as I know you, continued he, to be &s;ometimes an errant Wag, with a very grave Countenance, I am perhaps very much in the wrong to take what you &s;ay &s;eriou&s;ly. I leave you to ruminate on what I have told you, and &s;hall expect to know your Opinion of it the next time I &s;ee you. So we parted. But before I give him my O|pinion I de&s;ire to know yours.</P>

<HEAD>TO Sir RICHARD STEELE,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Patentee of the Theatre in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' at the time of writing this, I am almo&s;t overwhelm'd both with Sickne&s;s and Grief, yet I cannot forbear making a ju&s;t Complaint to you for your being the Occa&s;ion of both the&s;e, either by actually breaking your Word with me, or being perfectly pa&s;&s;ive while your Ma|nagers broke it; which, if it has not reduc'd me to immediate Nece&s;&s;ity, yet has brought me within the Danger of it, and con&s;e|quently within the Apprehen&s;ion of it, which is as grievous almo&s;t as the Thing. And that this Complaint is but too ju&s;tly ground|ed, you your &s;elf will acknowledge, when I have laid my Ca&s;e before you, which I &s;hall do in as few Words as I can.</P>
<P>It was upon the 27th of <HI>February,</HI> 1717/8, that I receiv'd a Letter from Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> by your Direction, and the Direction of the Managers under you, de&s;iring me to dine
<PB N="104" REF="118">
at your Hou&s;e on the 28th, and after Din|ner to read the Tragedy of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> to you, which I had alter'd from <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI> You cannot but remember, Sir, that upon reading it, the Play with the Alterations was approv'd of, nay and warmly approv'd of, by your &s;elf, Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> (the other Manager was not there) and that Re&s;olutions were taken for the acting it in the beginning of this Winter. Now I ap|peal to your &s;elf, if any Dramatick Per|formance could be more &s;ea&s;onable in the beginning of a Winter, when we were threatned with an Inva&s;ion from <HI>Sweden</HI> on the North, and from <HI>Spain</HI> on the We&s;t, than a Tragedy who&s;e Moral is thus ex|pre&s;t in the la&s;t Lines of the Play.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;They who thro' Ambition or Revenge,</L>
<L>Or impious Intere&s;t join with Foreign Foes,</L>
<L>T' oppre&s;s or to de&s;troy their native Country,</L>
<L>Shall find, like <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> &s;oon or late</L>
<L>From their perfidious Foreign Friends their Fate.</L></Q>
<P>I am &s;ure, Sir, I need not tell one of your Under&s;tanding, that this Moral is &s;o apparently the Foundation of the Drama|tick Action, and mu&s;t appear to every Spe|ctator and Reader to be &s;o truly the genu|ine Re&s;ult of it, that if I had not &s;aid one Word of it, every Reader and Spectator
<PB N="105" REF="119">
would have been able to have &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o much to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Well, Sir! when the Winter came on, what was done by your Deputies? Why, in|&s;tead of keeping their Word with me, they &s;pent above two Months of the Sea&s;on in getting up <HI>All for Love, or the World well lo&s;t,</HI> a Play which has indeed a noble fir&s;t Act, an Act which ends with a Scene be|coming of the Dignity of the Tragick Stage. But if <HI>Horace</HI> had been now alive, and been either a Reader or Spectator of that En|tertainment, he would have pa&s;&s;ed his old Sentence upon the Author.</P>
<Q><L>Infelix operis &s;umm&acirc; quia ponere totum </L><L>Ne&s;ciet.</L></Q>
<P>For was ever any thing &s;o pernicious, &s;o immoral, &s;o criminal, as the De&s;ign of that Play? I have mention'd the Title of it, give me leave to &s;et before you the two la&s;t Lines:</P>
<Q><L>And Fame to late Po&s;terity &s;hall tell,</L>
<L>No Lovers liv'd &s;o great, or dy'd &s;o well.</L></Q>
<P>And this Encomium of the Conduct and the Death of <HI>Anthony</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> a Con|duct &s;o immoral, and a Self-murder &s;o cri|minal, is, to give it more Force, put into the Mouth of the High-Prie&s;t of <HI>I&s;is</HI>; tho'
<PB N="106" REF="120">
that Prie&s;t could not but know, that what he thus commended, would cau&s;e immedi|ately the utter De&s;truction of his Country, and make it become a Conquer'd and a <HI>Roman</HI> Province. Certainly never could the De&s;ign of an Author &s;quare more ex|actly with the De&s;ign of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> at the time when it was written, which was by debauching the People ab&s;olutely to en|&s;lave them.</P>
<P>For, pray Sir, what do the Title and the two la&s;t Lines of this Play amount to in plain <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> Why to this, that if any Per&s;on of Quality or other &s;hall turn away his Wife, his young, affectionate, virtuous, charming Wife (for all the&s;e <HI>Octavia</HI> was) to take to his Bed a loo&s;e abandon'd Pro|&s;titute, and &s;hall in her Arms exhau&s;t his Patrimony, de&s;troy his Health, ema&s;culate his Mind, and lo&s;e his Reputation and all his Friends, why all this is well and greatly done, his Ruine is his Commendation. And if afterwards in De&s;pair, he either hangs or drowns him&s;elf, or goes out of the World like a Rat, with a Do&s;e of Ar&s;enick or Sub|limate, why 'tis a great and an envied Fate, he dies nobly and heroically. It is, Sir, with extream Reluctance that I have &s;aid all this. For I would not be thought to affront the Memory of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> for who&s;e extraordinary Qualities no Man has a greater Veneration than my &s;elf. But
<PB N="107" REF="121">
that all Con&s;iderations ought to give Place to the Publick Good, is a Truth of which you, of all Men, I am &s;ure, can never doubt.</P>
<P>And can you believe then, after having recommended Virtue and Publick Spirit for &s;o many Years to the World, that you can give your Subalterns Authority to preach up Adultery to a Town, which &s;tands &s;o little in need of their Doctrine? Is not the Cha&s;tity of the Marriage Bed one of the chief Incendiaries of Publick Spirit, and the Frequency of Adulteries one of the chief Extingui&s;hers of it; according to that of <HI>Horace</HI></P>
<Q><L>Foecunda culpae &s;ecula, nuptias</L>
<L>Primum inquinavere, &amp; Genus, &amp; Domos,</L>
<L>Hoc Fonte derivata clades</L>
<L>In patriam populumque fluxit.</L></Q>
<P>For when Adultery's become &s;o frequent, e&s;pecially among Per&s;ons of Condition, up|on who&s;e Sentiments all Publick Spirit chiefly depends, that a great many Hu&s;|bands begin to believe, or perhaps but to &s;u&s;|pect, that they who are called their Chil|dren are not their own; I appeal to you, Sir, if that Belief or that Su&s;picion mu&s;t not exceedingly cool their Zeal for the Wel|fare of tho&s;e Children, and con&s;equently for the Welfare of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>As I had infinitely the Advantage of <HI>All</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="122">
<HI>for Love</HI> in the Moral of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> I had it by Con&s;equence in the whole Tragedy; for the <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> as I have alter'd it, ha|ving a ju&s;t Moral, and by Con&s;equence at the Bottom a general and allegorical Acti|on, and univer&s;al and allegorical Characters, and for that very rea&s;on a Fable, is there|fore a true Tragedy, if it be not a ju&s;t and a regular one; but 'tis as ju&s;t and as regular as I could make it, upon &s;o irregular a Plan as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s: Whereas <HI>All for Love</HI> having no Moral, and con&s;equently no ge|neral and allegorical Action, nor general and allegorical Characters, can for that Rea|&s;on have no Fable, and therefore can be no Tragedy. 'Tis indeed only a particular Account of what happen'd formerly to <HI>An|thony</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and a mo&s;t pernicious Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>And as I had the Advantage in the Merit of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> I had it likewi&s;e in the World's Opinion of the Merit and Reputation of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in Tragedy above that of Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> For let Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Genius for Tragedy be what it will, he has more than once publickly own'd, that it was much in|ferior to <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, and particularly in tho&s;e two remarkable Lines in his Prologue to <HI>Aurenge-Zebe.</HI></P>
<Q><L>And when he hears his Godlike <HI>Romans</HI> rage, </L><L>He in a ju&s;t De&s;pair would quit the Stage.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="109" REF="123">And in the Ver&s;es to Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> thyGift, I place before my Sight;</L>
<L>With Awe, I ask his Ble&s;&s;ing ere I write;</L>
<L>With Reverence look on his maje&s;tick Face,</L>
<L>Proud to be le&s;s, but of his Godlike Race.</L></Q>
<P>And the &s;ame Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has more than once declar'd to me, that there was &s;ome|thing in this very Tragedy of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> as it was writ by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that is truly great and truly <HI>Roman</HI>; and I more than once an&s;wer'd him, that it had always been my own Opinion. Now I appeal to you and your Managers, if it has lo&s;t any thing under my Hands.</P>
<P>But what is more con&s;iderable than all this, your Deputy Lieutenants for the Stage have ten times the Opinion of the Advan|tage which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has over Mr. <HI>Dry|den</HI> in Tragedy, than either I or the re&s;t of the World have. Ever &s;ince I was capa|ble of reading <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> I have always had and have always expre&s;t that Veneration for him, which is ju&s;tly his due; of which I believe no one can doubt, who has read the E&s;&s;ay which I publi&s;h'd &s;ome Years ago upon his Genius and Writings. But what they ex|pre&s;s upon all Occa&s;ions, is not E&s;teem, is not Admiration, but flat Idolatry.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, I had the Advantage of the very Opinion which tho&s;e People had of
<PB N="110" REF="124">
their own Intere&s;t in the Ca&s;e. They knew very well that it was but twelve Years &s;ince <HI>All for Love</HI> had been acted. And they were likewi&s;e &s;atisfied, that from its fir&s;t Run, as they call, to the beginning of this la&s;t Winter, it had never brought four Au|diences together. At the &s;ame time there was no Occa&s;ion to tell them, that the <HI>Co|riolanus</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had not been acted in twenty Years, and that when it was brought upon the Stage twenty Years a|go, it was acted twenty Nights together.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I &s;hall be oblig'd to you, if you will acquaint me, for what mighty and unknown Rea&s;on, the <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> not|with&s;tanding yours and their warm Approba|tion of it, notwith&s;tanding your Words &s;o|lemnly given to act it, as &s;oon as it could conve+niently be brought upon the Stage this Win|ter, notwith&s;tanding the Merit of the Play it &s;elf, I &s;peak of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s part of it, not|with&s;tanding the World's and their own O|pinion of the &s;uperior Merit of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in Tragedy; and their very Opinion of their own Intere&s;t in the Ca&s;e, nay notwith&s;tanding the exact Sea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Moral for the Service of King <HI>George</HI> and of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which above all things ought to have been con&s;ider'd by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the King's Ser|vants, and who act under his Authority: I &s;ay, Sir, I &s;hould be extremely oblig'd to

Thou wilt tell me perhaps that thou art not qualified. For that very Rea&s;on thou &s;halt write one, becau&s;e for that very Rea&s;on thou wilt certainly &s;uc|ceed. But perhaps thou wilt tell me that thou &s;halt write a very damn'd Play indeed. A &s;tronger Rea&s;on &s;till for thy Writing. For the more damnable thy Play happens to be,
<PB N="113" REF="127">
the greater and more flaming will thy Suc|ce&s;s be. And &s;o, like a modern Author, or a modern Female Beggar, thou &s;halt &s;upply thy own infinite Wants, by the in|finite Wants of thy Offspring. But why art thou not qualified, Friend <HI>Pinky</HI>? There are now-a-days but three Qualifications re|qui&s;ite for the &s;ucceeding upon the Stage. The fir&s;t is the want of that &s;ame. For thou know'&s;t the Belly is <HI>Ingenii largitor.</HI> The &s;econd Qualification is, that as modern Criticks when they come to a new Play are never without a Cat-call, a modern Poet who writes &s;uch a Play &s;hould never be without a Fool-call. He mu&s;t have the knack of jugging Fools into a Pit, as a Country Squire does Partridges into a Trammel. The third Qualification, and which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the inforcing the other two, is what they call a Stock, a very great Stock; not a Stock of Silver, nor yet of Gold, but of a Metal more powerful than either, and which commands them both. Now upon the Foot of the&s;e three Qualifications, who the Devil is half &s;o well qualified for the writing a Comedy as thou art? Is it Pro|ctor <HI>John Little-wit,</HI> or <HI>Scribble Da&s;h</HI> the Inns of <HI>Chancery</HI> Bard? Or the Czar's old Soldier? Friend <HI>Pinky,</HI> thou art never mo|de&s;t but in the wrong Place. Why none of the&s;e are worthy to carry thy Cloak after thee, and hardly worthy to

carry thy Friend <HI>Tom</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s. For where as thou art a living breathing Come|dy, they are a lea&s;h of dull Devils who are Tragedy all over. Their very Je&s;ts are deep Tragedy. They never endeavour to make us laugh but they move Terror and Compa&s;&s;ion. Their very Offer at a Je&s;t moves Terror, and 'tis no &s;ooner out, but it moves Compa&s;&s;ion. But as for thee, thou ha&s;t nothing to do but to write a long Part for thy &s;elf, and then, if thou ha&s;t no Je&s;t in thy <HI>Chit Chat,</HI> thou wilt have a per|petual one in thy Per&s;on, and that will do thy Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have here the Honour to &s;end Your Lord&s;hip the Ab&s;tract of that Propo&s;al, which I laid before you about the middle of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament. I did not think fit to remind Your Lord&s;hip of it before, becau&s;e tho' you might have ap|prov'd of it, it was then too late for the Parliament to go through it, and be&s;ides I had &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion that that Parlia|ment would not enter into it.</P>
<P>My Lord, at pre&s;ent I humbly conceive, with all imaginable Submi&s;&s;ion to your Lord&s;hip's Judgment, that the bringing this Propo&s;al to Practice would be highly con|venient, and perhaps nece&s;&s;ary; ab&s;olute|ly
<PB N="120" REF="134">
nece&s;&s;ary, if the War is like to be of any long continuance, and highly conveni|ent though it &s;hould be like to have a &s;pee|dy end: Becau&s;e in this la&s;t Ca&s;e, I hum|bly conceive that we &s;hould have a better and more &s;olid Peace than we &s;hould have without it. For nothing, with Submi&s;&s;ion to your Lord&s;hip's Judgment, would more alarm the <HI>French</HI> than the reducing this Propo&s;al to Practice. For &s;ince they have but two ways of &s;ucceeding in their De&s;igns again&s;t the&s;e Nations, which are the Dividing us at Home, and the ruining our Commerce Abroad; they would lo&s;e the very Hope of Succe&s;s, if they &s;hould &s;ee them&s;elves pre|vented in both, to which the bringing this Propo&s;al to Practice would contribute not a little.

My Lord, I humbly conceive that it would have &s;ome Advantages above all other Taxes. For as far as I am able to make a Judgment upon a four Years &s;crutiny, 'tis a Tax that is very much de&s;ir'd even after &s;o long a War, and which is remarkable, it is mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd by tho&s;e who are to pay the Money, becau&s;e by this Tax &s;omething would be done for them preferably to the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Preface to a Comedy call'd the MASQUERADE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have lately read over the Preface to a certain comical Rhap&s;ody, with an odd mixture of Laughter and Indignation, upon which I &s;hall here &s;end you &s;ome Remarks that were made in a cur&s;ory manner. He pretends to turn your own Canon upon you, but he has done it to &s;o fine a purpo&s;e that it has recoil'd with violence upon him&s;elf, and quite demoli&s;h'd the paltry Works he has rais'd. For what confounded Sot will read any thing of an Author who is capa|ble of writing &s;uch a Preface? Mr. <HI>Dry|den</HI> tells us in his Preface to the <HI>Medal,</HI> that upon his writing <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> he met with ju&s;t &s;uch Adver&s;aries. What Reflections he makes upon that notable way of proceeding, you will find in the
<PB N="123" REF="137">
fore&s;aid Preface. But to return to that of our Author.</P>
<P>He has very little Inclination, he &s;ays, to write Prefaces; becau&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, 'tis not &s;o ea&s;ie to &s;teal Prefaces as Plays. However, as difficult as 'tis, he has brought it about. He has boldly &s;eiz'd upon yours, and boa&s;ts of it as Plunder in&s;tead of Theft.</P>
<P>He neither commends nor defends the Play; which would be to wa&s;te his Breath, in commending <HI>Shirly</HI> and <HI>Taverner</HI>: But he &s;pends his borrow'd Preface in com|mending the Actors, who vouch&s;af'd to be the Receivers and Venders of his &s;tolen Goods. His <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> he &s;ays, owes all his Succe&s;s to them. And here the Pa|negyrick which others be&s;tow upon &s;ome one &s;ub&s;tantial Patron, he is for retailing among a Company of Actors, which he di|&s;tributes among them at &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a rate, that not a Mortal of them can pretend to any Share of it. For fir&s;t, the Succe&s;s of this Play is owing to the ju&s;t Performance of the Players in general; then 'tis parti|cularly owing to the Grace, which, with her u&s;ual Excellence, Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> gave to her Part. Indeed no one who has had the Happine&s;s to know Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> can in the lea&s;t doubt of her being qualified when|ever &s;he plea&s;es to give extraordinary Plea|&s;ure by her Parts. But now to &s;hew that Fools as well as Children are for Boys Play,
<PB N="124" REF="138">
this Per&s;on the very next Moment re&s;umes the Commendation which he &s;o very ge|nerou&s;ly granted to the Company in gene|ral, and &s;o very ju&s;tly to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> in particular; and to &s;hew his old Inclination to Arbitrary Power, pretends to make a fre&s;h Grant of it for the &s;ole u&s;e of Ma&s;ter <HI>Robert Wilks. The Succe&s;s of this Come|dy,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is owing entirely to Ma&s;ter</HI> Robert. Well! I have read many a gro&s;s, ful&s;ome, flattering Fool, but I never read any one before, who was Fool enough to own, that he flatter'd gro&s;sly and ful&s;omly. For when he tells Mr. <HI>Robert Wilks,</HI> that the Succe&s;s of the Play is entirely due to him, and in the &s;ame Breath tells the whole Company 'tis due to them, and in the &s;ame Breath tells Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> that 'tis very particularly due to her; what does he do but laugh in Ma&s;ter <HI>Robert</HI>'s Face, and tell him, that he takes him for the errante&s;t Ba|by that ever was bit at Bob-cherry. But now to &s;hew that this Fellow is more Fool than Knave, and that he does not flatter on this Occa&s;ion &s;o much as he thinks he does, and owns that he does, I will venture to bring him off a little; nay I will venture to &s;hew, that when he &s;ays the Succe&s;s of the Play is entirely due to Mr. <HI>Robert Wilks,</HI> he does not flatter at all. For I have heard a grave Bird &s;ing, that if it had not been for him alone, the <HI>Ma&s;querade</HI> had never

Be&s;ides, I con&s;ider'd that Authors as well as Petti|foggers ought to have long Vacation, and that it was but rea&s;onable that the World &s;hould once a Year enjoy an Interval from being plagu'd with either; that it was highly expedient, that Minds &s;ometimes &s;hould lye

<P>That is, I have been for the&s;e three Weeks at Gra&s;s with meer white Cattle, and have not &s;o much as &s;een three rea&s;onable Crea|tures, &s;ince I left the neighbourhood of <HI>Whitehall.</HI> When I arriv'd at this Place, I had the Mortification to find that of my two Landlords in who&s;e Hou&s;es I had here formerly pa&s;s'd &s;o many delicious Hours, the one was gone to live at <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> and the other was run quite away. Upon enqui|ry, I found that there were but two Hou&s;es to lodge at, a common boarding Hou&s;e, or my Barber's. I con&s;ider'd that by going to the common boarding Hou&s;e, I &s;hould give up a good part of my Liber|ty, which is the principal Thing that makes the Country &s;o charming. For there might be Women at that Hou&s;e, or they might come the very Day after me, who, tho' old and ugly, might expect as much Cere|mony

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote to you this Morning for your more deliberate Opinion concerning the Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Phaedrus.</HI> I now &s;end this to you to con&s;ult you about an Expre&s;&s;ion in the <HI>Othello</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> long ago occa&s;ioned a great Di&s;pute at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Coffee-Hou&s;e, between the Wits there and the Manager of the Play-Hou&s;e who acts the Part of <HI>Othello.</HI> The Wits asked the Player how he lik'd this Expre&s;&s;ion in his own Part, <HI>Excellent Wretch!</HI> to which the latter an&s;wer'd, that he lik'd it &s;o ill, that he always left it out. Upon which they immediately extoll'd it to the Skies, and look'd upon the Player with great Con|tempt. Tho' that Tragedian has no more Judgment in Tragedy than an A&s;s has in Mu&s;ick, I am apt to believe that he was

this once in the right. I know indeed very well, that <HI>mi&s;er</HI> and <HI>mi&s;ellus</HI> were &s;ome|times among the <HI>Romans</HI> Terms of Ten|derne&s;s. I find that <HI>mi&s;er</HI> is in that Sen&s;e in the Eunuch of <HI>Terence,</HI> Act the third Scene the la&s;t, where <HI>Chaerea</HI> gives <HI>Anti|pho</HI> an Account of his enjoying <HI>Pamphila.</HI></P>

<P>Which Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has tran&s;lated <HI>pau|vre Gar&ccedil;on!</HI> But are there not two &s;orts of Tenderne&s;s, a Comick and a Tragick Ten|derne&s;s? Now tho' <HI>mi&s;er</HI> was &s;ometimes us'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> to expre&s;s both the one and the other Tenderne&s;s, yet, in my Opinion, it can never be tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by the Word <HI>Wretch</HI> in any but the Comick way; <HI>Wretch</HI> in a &s;erious Sen&s;e being al|ways, if I am not mi&s;taken, a Term of Re|proach or Contempt: And con&s;equently the Terms <HI>Excellent Wretch,</HI> being incon|&s;i&s;tent and contradictory, make the mean|ing ab&s;urd, and the Expre&s;&s;ion Non&s;en&s;e. This is my Opinion at pre&s;ent, but I know not how long it will be &s;o, becau&s;e I have not as yet heard yours.</P>
<P>But that is not the only Point in which I de&s;ire it. I am told lately by one of my
<PB N="140" REF="154">
Acquaintance, that I have been too &s;evere upon the Under&s;tanding of another of the Managers, and that is of <HI>Cibber.</HI> And the Rea&s;on that was given me was, that <HI>Cibber</HI> writ <HI>the Fool in Fa&s;hion,</HI> which, &s;ays my Friend, you have often &s;aid is a good Co|medy. To which I an&s;wer, that 'tis true, I have often &s;aid 'tis a good Comedy, but I had always much ado to believe that <HI>Cib|ber</HI> writ it, and that &s;ince I have &s;een the <HI>Nonjuror</HI> and the <HI>Heroick Daughter</HI> I do not believe it at all. For which I &s;hall give my Rea&s;ons, and afterwards de&s;ire to know from you how convincing they appear to you.</P>
<P>When <HI>the Fool in Fa&s;hion</HI> was fir&s;t act|ed, <HI>Cibber</HI> was hardly twenty Years of Age. Now could he at the Age of twenty write a Comedy with a ju&s;t De&s;ign, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Characters, and a proper Dia|logue, who now at forty treats us with <HI>Hibernian</HI> Sen&s;e and <HI>Hibernian Engli&s;h?</HI> Could he, when he was an arrant Boy, draw a good Comedy, from his own raw uncultivated Head, who is now at forty able to do nothing but what is poor and mean, when he is &s;upported by two &s;uch Ma&s;ters as <HI>Moliere</HI> and <HI>Corneille?</HI></P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erv'd to you, that there is not in his <HI>Heroick Daughter</HI> one Spark of the Force and noble Spirit of <HI>Corneille.</HI> As for <HI>Moliere,</HI> I am &s;atisfied that he knows
<PB N="141" REF="155">
nothing of him, but that he built his <HI>Non|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uror</HI> upon &s;ome &s;piritle&s;s dull Tran&s;lation of him. When I heard that a Play with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Title was to be acted, I wi&s;h'd it as much Succe&s;s as <HI>Cibber</HI> did, upon account of the Cau&s;e in which it was writ. But I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">efus'd to &s;ee it acted, becau&s;e knowing <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Play to be a Ma&s;ter-piece, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fraid I &s;hould be ask'd &s;ome Que&s;tions by my Friends which I &s;hould not care to an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">wer. I heard an advantagious Character of it, from &s;ome with whom I conver&s;ed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd what I heard I imparted to others, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> coming from my Friends and not from my &s;elf. After the Play was printed, I wou'd not read it till it had been publi&s;h'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Month, during which time I was ask'd a hundred Que&s;tions about it. When I &s;aw that the Curio&s;ity of the World was pretty well over, I &s;ent for the Play and read it. Upon the reading it, I was &s;oon confirm'd in &s;ome of my former Thoughts, that Per|&s;ons of a very good Under&s;tanding might be impos'd upon at a Repre&s;entation by the Liveline&s;s and Grace of Action, and that the Excellence of the Actor often makes amends for the Imperfections of the Author. I &s;oon found that there was little in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedy of the Beauties of <HI>Moliere.</HI> For <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Characters in his <HI>Tartuffe</HI> are Ma&s;ter-pieces, mark'd, di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd, glowing, bold, touch'd with a fine
<PB N="142" REF="156">
yet a daring Hand; all of them &s;tamp'd with a double Stamp, the one from Art and the other from Nature: No Phantoms but real Per&s;ons, &s;uch as Nature produces in all Ages, and Cu&s;tom fa&s;hions in ours. His Dialogue too is lively, natural, graceful, ea&s;ie, &s;trong, adapted to the Occa&s;ion, adapted to the Characters. In &s;hort, 'tis by this Comedy and by the <HI>Mi&s;antrope</HI> that <HI>Moliere</HI> perhaps has born away the Prize of Comedy from all Per&s;ons in all Ages, ex|cept <HI>Ben. John&s;on</HI> alone. But the Chara|cters of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedy are mo&s;t of them daub'd and bungled, and the Dia|logue nothing but meer Fribble. Now is it barely po&s;&s;ible that this bungling Imita|tor can be the Author of <HI>the Fool in Fa|&s;hion?</HI> Is it barely po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have known Mankind and the Stage, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue when he was an errant Boy, who is gro&s;sly ignorant of them all at forty? But <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Name is prefix'd to <HI>the Fool in Fa&s;hion.</HI> They know nothing of Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who in the lea&s;t wonder at that. He who, now he is turn'd of Forty, &s;ets his Name, without any manner of Scru|ple or Ceremony, to what all the World knows was writ by <HI>Fletcher</HI> and <HI>Dryden,</HI> could not his Vanity, when he was a Boy, prevail upon him to own what an unknown tho' a very ingenious Gentleman writ?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I De&s;ir'd in my la&s;t that you wou'd be Arbitrator in a Di&s;pute, which I lately had with Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> concerning &s;ome Ver&s;es of <HI>Virgil.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age is in the 3d Eclogue.</P>

<L>Et fugit ad &s;alices, &amp; &s;e cupit ant&egrave; videri.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> affirm'd that the Nymph in acting and the Shepherd in rela|ting, meant nothing but Boys and Girls Play. My Opinion is, that &s;uch an Interpre|tation renders the Pa&s;&s;age wholly flat and in&s;ipid, and fit to plea&s;e none but Children; that the Nymph by throwing the Apple, and then running away to the Willows, but at the &s;ame time taking care that the
<PB N="155" REF="169">
Shepherd &s;hould &s;ee her before &s;he got to them, de&s;ign'd Mans and Womans Play. Now, Sir, you are left to judge which of the Explications is mo&s;t worthy of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and which comes neare&s;t up to that <HI>Molle</HI> and that <HI>Facetum</HI> which at that time of Day compos'd the Character of <HI>Virgil,</HI> if we will take the Opinion of a very judi|cious Critick, and that was his Friend <HI>Ho|race</HI>;</P>
<Q><L>Molle atque Facetum</L>

<P>For where is the <HI>Molle</HI> and the <HI>Facetum</HI> in the&s;e Ver&s;es, if the Nymph and the Shep|herd, like Boys and Girls, were only at hide and &s;eek? I could as &s;oon believe that when <HI>Silenus</HI> in the Sixth Eclogue &s;ays, &s;peaking of <HI>Aegle, Huic aliud mercedis erit,</HI> he only in|tended to pre&s;ent her with a Pair of Gloves. I know indeed very well, that <HI>Ruaeus</HI> in|terprets <HI>La&s;civa</HI> by <HI>Joco&s;a Puella.</HI> But it ought to be con&s;ider'd, that <HI>Ruaeus</HI> was a Prie&s;t and that the Dauphin was young, and that it was the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Duty of the Je&s;uit to conceal from his young Pu|pil the Lubricity of the Poet's meaning. Nor is <HI>La&s;civa</HI> us'd upon this occa&s;ion, tho' 'tis taken in the common Sen&s;e &s;o very different from <HI>Joco&s;a Puella,</HI> if we con&s;ider that <HI>Homer,</HI> whenever he has occa&s;ion to mention <HI>Venus,</HI> calls her the Laughter|loving

<P>Now when we con&s;ider all the&s;e Things, can we believe that <HI>Virgil,</HI> who was &s;o ju|dicious, &s;o wi&s;e, and who follow'd Na|ture &s;o clo&s;ely, meant nothing but <HI>Hide and Seek</HI> by his <HI>&s;e cupit ant&egrave; videri.</HI> That which makes this one of the beautifulle&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages of all the Eclogues, is, that there is a very wanton Meaning expre&s;s'd in very mode&s;t Words, and con&s;equently occa|&s;ion given to the Reader to &s;hew his Di&s;|cernment by piercing the Veil which the Poet has thrown over the Nudity; which puts me in mind of a fine Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Mon|taigne.

<P>Now is there any thing that has the lea&s;t Air of a Je&s;t? On the other &s;ide, do you think that the Author could be capable of meaning and thinking what he pretends to affirm here? Is it not plain by the la&s;t Words which I have quoted, <HI>viz. the Mind of Man,</HI> that he intended a Fallacy? For to affirm this of the Mind of Man, as 'tis cultivated and in&s;tructed, is not only ab&s;urd and ri|diculous, but contradictory of him&s;elf.

I have known a Country Fidler who has been the Delight of three Counties, tho' he could never play the Truth of one Tune; and a Sign-Po&s;t Painter, who has been the Ad|miration not only of the Rabble, but even of mo&s;t of the Squires of the North of <HI>Eng|land.</HI>

I appeal to the Book&s;ellers, who in this Ca&s;e ought to be Judges without Appeal, whether more of the common People do not approve of <HI>Quarles</HI> and <HI>Bunyan</HI> than e&s;teem <HI>Chevy Cha&s;e.</HI> Therefore 'tis plain that Au|thor could not de&s;ign that the Period a|bove-mentioned &s;hould run thus,</P>

So that the Author, by <HI>the Mind of Man,</HI> meaning neither the Mind of Man as it is rude and untaught, nor the Mind of Man as 'tis cultivated and in&s;tructed, can mean nothing in the World but to try how far he can impo&s;e upon his Reader.

<P><Q REND="inline">Human Nature is the &s;ame in all rea|&s;onable Creatures, and whatever falls in with it, will meet with Admirers among Readers of all Qualities and Conditions. <HI>Moliere,</HI> as we are told by <HI>Boileau,</HI> us'd

For he tells us the Au|dience always follow'd the old Woman, and never failed to laugh in the &s;ame Place.</Q></P>
<P>Now can you, Sir, or any Man of good Sen&s;e believe that the Author does not know better what belongs to a Je&s;t, than to take fal&s;e Rea&s;oning for one; and that he does not know better what belongs to fal&s;e Rea&s;oning than to mean what he &s;ays here?

mo&s;t injudicious and fooli&s;h part of the Rab|ble?</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>Horace</HI> was &s;o far from being of Opinion, that the univer&s;al Approbation of the Multitude was the Ta&s;te and Touch|&s;tone of good Poetry, that in the la&s;t Satyr of his fir&s;t Book, he advi&s;es the Poet of his Formation to take no manner of Care about plea&s;ing them.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">I know nothing that more &s;hews the e&s;|&s;ential and inherent Perfection of Simpli|city of Thought, above that which I call the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner in writing, than this, that the fir&s;t plea&s;es all kinds of Palates, and the latter only &s;uch as have formed to them&s;elves a wrong artificial Ta&s;te upon little fanciful Authors and Writers of Epi|grams. <HI>Homer, Virgil,</HI> or <HI>Milton,</HI> &s;o far as the Language of their Poems is under|&s;tood, will plea&s;e a Reader of plain com|mon Sen&s;e, that would neither reli&s;h nor comprehend an Epigram of <HI>Martial,</HI> or a Poem of <HI>Cowley</HI>; &s;o on the contrary, an or|dinary

<P>Now, Sir, can any thing be more plain, than that the <HI>Spectator</HI> here cannot mean what he &s;ays? Becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Man of common Sen&s;e, much le&s;s for one of his notable Parts, to be guilty of &s;o many Ab&s;urdities as there are in this little Para|graph. I will make no Objection at pre|&s;ent about the <HI>Gothick</HI> Ta&s;te. I think I have call'd it &s;omewhere &s;o my &s;elf, tho' tis certain that the pointed conceited way of Wit was in Fa&s;hion long before the <HI>Goths</HI> were either a Name or a Nation. For you find it not only in <HI>Florus,</HI> in <HI>Martial,</HI> in <HI>Seneca,</HI> in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> but even in &s;ome of the Writers of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Age, as <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Paterculus.</HI> But here are more Im|portant Errors to be taken Notice of. For fir&s;t, the <HI>Spectator</HI> would make us believe that all People are Judges of Simplicity of Thought, and that the Rabble are better Judges of it, than they who have had a gene|rous Education. That more People compre|hend the Excellency of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> than the Beauties of <HI>Martial</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="188">
and <HI>Cowley,</HI> tho' perhaps there are not ten Per&s;ons living who know all the Merit of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> had been printed forty Years before it was known to the greate&s;t Part of <HI>England,</HI> that there barely was &s;uch a Book.

The Rea&s;on which he gives for this, and which he &s;ays is plain, is, becau&s;e the &s;ame Paintings of Nature which recommend it to the mo&s;t ordinary Reader, will appear beautiful to the mo&s;t refin'd; as if &s;ome faint and imperfect Touches of Nature might not recommend a thing to tho&s;e by rea&s;on of their Igno|rance or their Stupidity, know not how far an Author ought to go in &s;uch a Ca&s;e to expre&s;s the Truth of Nature, which faint and imperfect Strokes would by no means &s;atisfy tho&s;e who are able to judge of that Truth.</P>
<P>Sir, the <HI>Spectator</HI> imagines here, that there is nothing contrary to Simplicity of Thought, but that pointed conceited way
<PB N="175" REF="189">
of writing which we mention'd above, whereas Simplicity of Thought, is Thought which naturally ari&s;es from the Subject, Ideas which bear a ju&s;t Proportion to the Things they repre&s;ent, and which the Sub|ject &s;eems of it &s;elf as it were to offer to us, in&s;tead of our obtruding them upon that. If we truly con&s;ider what Simplicity of Thought in Poetry is, we &s;hall find that there are three things which are equally di&s;tant from it, and tho&s;e are, Imbecility, Affectation and Extravagance; Imbecility, when a Man wants Force to come up to the Truth of Nature; Affectation, when a Man goes be&s;ide it, thro' Error, Luxury and Wantonne&s;s of Soul; and Extravagance, when a Man goes beyond it, thro' a fal&s;e and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ll-tim'd Effort to &s;hew his Strength and Excellence. We &s;hall find too that Sim|plicity of Thought is not &s;ufficient to make what we call Metre Poetry; that there mu&s;t be likewi&s;e a Simplicity of Expre&s;&s;ion; that a Simplicity of Expre&s;&s;ion is an Expre&s;&s;i|on which is according to Nature, that is an Expre&s;&s;ion proportion'd to the Ideas, as they are to the Things, and that con&s;equently then the Expre&s;&s;ion in great Subjects, and in great Thoughts is &s;imple, when it is pa&s;&s;ionate, figurative, &s;ounding and har|monious; and that an Author, who in great Subjects and in great Thoughts &s;hews an Expre&s;&s;ion, which comes &s;hort of this,
<PB N="176" REF="190">
&s;hews not a Simplicity but an Imbecility of Expre&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, as all the Heroick Virtues are compatible with Simplicity of Heart, &s;o all the Magnificence of the mo&s;t pompous Eloquence is on &s;ome Occa&s;ions con&s;i&s;tent with Simplicity of Style. But now let us &s;ee a little how the <HI>Specta|tor</HI> goes on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">The old Song of <HI>Chevy Cha&s;e, &s;ays he,</HI> is the favourite Ballad of the common Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI>; and <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> us'd to &s;ay, he had rather have been the Author of it, than of all his Works. Sir <HI>Philip Sid|ney,</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e of Poetry, &s;peaks of it in the following Words. I never heard the old Song of <HI>Piercy</HI> and <HI>Douglas,</HI> that I found not my Heart more mov'd than with a Trumpet, and yet it was &s;ung by &s;ome blind Crowder with a Voice as rough as his Style, which being &s;o evil apparrel|led in the Du&s;t aad Cobweb of that un|civil Age, what would it work trimm'd in the gorgeous Eloquence of <HI>Pindar</HI>? For my own part, <HI>&s;ays the <HI>Spectator</HI>,</HI> I am &s;o pro|fe&s;&s;ed an Admirer of this antiquated Song, that I &s;hall give my Reader a Critick upon it, without any further Apology for &s;o do|ing.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, as I &s;hew'd you before by his Sophi&s;try, that the <HI>Spectator</HI> is not in ear|ne&s;t; &s;o here it may appear by the Autho|rities he brings that he is not in Je&s;t. I am

&s;o very well convinced of the &s;olid Judg|ment of <HI>Ben.

As for Sir <HI>Philip Sid|ney,</HI> do but ob&s;erve the Expre&s;&s;ion which that noble Gentleman u&s;es; he tells us not that his Heart was moved by the Song of <HI>Piercy</HI> and <HI>Douglas</HI> as often as he read it, or heard it read, but as often as he heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ung, nay, tho' it was &s;ung by an old Crowder.

con&s;titutes the Difference between that and Pro&s;e, &s;hall make it appear that the Writer of this old Song, in &s;pight of the Applau&s;e of &s;o many Ages, never knew what Poetry was. In order to which, let us give very near the &s;ame Account of it that we for|merly did in the <HI>Grounds of Critici&s;m in Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>Poetry then is an Art, by which a Poet excites Pa&s;&s;ion, (and to that very end en|tertains Sen&s;e) by a bold and figurative Language, and by mea&s;ur'd harmonious Pe|riods, in order to &s;atisfy and improve, to delight and reform the Mind, and &s;o to make Mankind happier and better.</P>
<P>Poetry therefore is Poetry, becau&s;e 'tis more pa&s;&s;ionate and &s;en&s;ual than Pro&s;e. A Poet has two ways of exciting Pa&s;&s;ion. The one by the Figurativene&s;s, and the other by the Harmony of his Expre&s;&s;ion; but the Figures contribute more to the exciting of Pa&s;&s;ion than Harmony. A Di&s;cour&s;e that is writ in &s;mooth and tolerable Num|bers, if 'tis not figurative can be but mea|&s;ur'd Pro&s;e; but a Di&s;cour&s;e that is every where bold and figurative, and con&s;equent|ly every where extremely pathetick, is cer|tainly Poetry without Numbers. Be&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> this alone is a convincing Proof that a Fi+gurative Expre&s;&s;ion is more e&s;&s;ential <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Poetry than Harmony, <HI>viz.</HI> that Harmony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;elf, if 'tis any thing perfect, depends up+on

a figurative Expre&s;&s;ion; there being no Example among the Antients them&s;elves of a Ravi&s;hing Poetical Mu&s;ick, without figu|rative Language.

The fourth Quality of the Diction is, that it be exalted and &s;onorous. For every thing that is vulgar in the Expre&s;&s;ion is below it. It requires Words which have nothing that is ba&s;e and common in them, a Diction that is noble and magnificent, Expre&s;&s;ions that are &s;trong, and Colours that are lively, and daring and audacious Strokes. It requires, to &s;ay all, a Di&s;cour&s;e that is able to come up to the Greatne&s;s of that Workman's Ideas, who ought to be the Maker and Creator of his own Works. The fifth
<PB N="185" REF="199">
Quality of the Diction is that it be harmo|nious, that it may maintain that great and maje&s;tick Air, with which Poetry is wont to adorn it &s;elf, and may expre&s;s all the Force and the utmo&s;t Dignity of the great Things which it utters. It ought to reject all Terms but tho&s;e that are proper to fill the Mouth and content the Ear, that it may attain to that Sublime and that Won|derful, which it always and every where aims at. But 'tis not &s;ufficient that there be Greatne&s;s and Magnificence in the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, there ought to be likewi&s;e Ardor and Vehemence, and there ought e&s;pecially to reign throughout the Di&s;cour&s;e, a fine, a graceful, and a delicate Air, which ought to appear its principal Ornament, and its mo&s;t univer&s;al Beauty.</P>
<P>Now what one of the&s;e great Qualities has the old Ballad of <HI>Chevy Cha&s;e?</HI> Of all the Lines which the Captain has quoted, 'tis remarkable, that there is but one which has any thing like a Figure in it. Now tho' the Subject of that Song is noble, yet there being nothing figurative in it, 'tis plain by con&s;equence that there is nothing great, nothing noble in it; no Magnificence, no Vehemence, no Painting, no Poetry. To compare any of the Pa&s;&s;ages in it to <HI>Virgil</HI> is ridiculous, and a Man may as well com|pare a dead Man to a living. For Exam|ple,

Who has taken more delight in prai&s;ing her Benefactor, or in branding and defaming her avowed and mortal E|nemies? In &s;hort, Sir, Liberty has been the continual Theme of my Pen, and the con&s;tant Employment of my Life. And have I taken all this Pains for my &s;elf? No. I wanted not common Sen&s;e to di&s;cern that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberties would be of longer continuance than my Life.

For you who have now been ab&s;ent twen|ty Years, will find here a Town entirely new; new Buildings, new Men, new Manners; Avarice, and Luxury, and Profu&s;ion joyn|ed in a Triple League, and Liberty, Pro|perty and Religion engag'd in a Battel Roy|al. You will find here entirely new Setts of all Sorts of Men; new Players at Che&s;s, who never could yet &s;ee two Removes be|fore them; new Whigs without one Dram of Publick Spirit; and new Wits and Poets without one Grain of Common Sen&s;e.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing &s;ome remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. WYCHERLEY's Life.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have lately had the Satisfaction to read over your Memoirs of Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> which I had la&s;t Week from Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> and found the Relation very entertaining and the Reflections ju&s;t and pathetick.

<P>And now, Sir, to enter upon the Sub|ject, without any more Ceremony. I ne|ver
<PB N="215" REF="231">
could learn, either from Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> him&s;elf, or from Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> or Sir <HI>Har|ry Sheer,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Walkeden,</HI> or from any of tho&s;e who had been longe&s;t acquainted with Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> that he had ever re|&s;ided at either of our Univer&s;ities. About the Age of Fifteen he was &s;ent for Education to the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>France,</HI> either to <HI>Saintonge</HI> or the <HI>Angoumois.</HI> His Abode there was either upon the Banks of the <HI>Charante,</HI> or very little remov'd from it. And he had there the Happine&s;s to be in the Neighbourhood of one of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;h'd Ladies of the Court of <HI>France, Madame de Montau&s;ier,</HI> whom <HI>Voiture</HI> has made famous by &s;everal very ingenious Let|ters, the mo&s;t of which were writ to her when &s;he was a Maid, and call'd <HI>Mada|moi&s;elle de Rambouillet.</HI> I have heard Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> &s;ay, that he was often admitted to the Conver&s;ation of that Lady, who us'd to call him the Little <HI>Hugenot</HI>; and that young as he was, he was equally pleas'd with the Beauty of her Mind, and with the Graces of her Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon the writing his fir&s;t Play, which was <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> he became acquainted with &s;everal of the mo&s;t celebrated Wits both of the Court and Town. The writing of that Play was likewi&s;e the Occa&s;ion of his becom|ing acquainted with one of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Mi&s;te&s;&s;es after a very particular manner.
<PB N="216" REF="232">
As Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was going thro' <HI>Pall-mall</HI> towards St. <HI>James</HI>'s in his Chariot, he met the fore&s;aid Lady in hers, who, thru&s;ting half her Body out of the Chariot, cry'd out aloud to him, <HI>You,</HI> Wycherley, <HI>you are a Son of a Whore,</HI> at the &s;ame time laugh|ing aloud and heartily. Perhaps, Sir, if you never heard of this Pa&s;&s;age before, you may be &s;urpris'd at &s;o &s;trange a Greet|ing from one of the mo&s;t beautiful and be&s;t bred Ladies in the World. Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was certainly very much &s;urpris'd at it, yet not &s;o much but he &s;oon apprehended it was &s;poke with Allu&s;ion to the latter End of a Song in the foremention'd Play.</P>
<Q><L>When Parents are Slaves</L>
<L>Their Brats cannot be any other,</L>
<L>Great Wits and great Braves</L>
<L>Have always a Punk to their Mother.</L></Q>
<P>As, during Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Surpri&s;e, the Chariots drove different ways, they were &s;oon at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from each other, when Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> recovering from his Surpri&s;e, ordered his Coachman to drive back, and to overtake the Lady. As &s;oon as he got over-again&s;t her, he &s;aid to her, <HI>Ma|dam, you have been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a Title on me which generally belongs to the For|tunate. Will your Lady&s;hip be at the Play to Night? Well,</HI> &s;he reply'd, <HI>what if I am</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="233">
<HI>there? Why then I will be there to wait on your Lady&s;hip, tho' I di&s;appoint a very fine Woman who has made me an A&s;&s;ignati|on. So,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>you are &s;ure to di&s;appoint a Woman who has favour'd you for one who has not. Yes,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>if &s;he who has not favour'd me is the finer Woman of the two. But he who will be con&s;tant to your Lady&s;hip, till he can find a finer Woman, is &s;ure to die your Captive.</HI> The Lady blu&s;h'd, and bade her Coachman drive away. As &s;he was then in all her Bloom, and the mo&s;t celebrated Beauty that was then in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or perhaps that has been in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince, &s;he was touch'd with the Gallantry of that Compliment. In &s;hort, &s;he was that Night in the fir&s;t Row of the King's Box in <HI>Drury Lane,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the Pit under her, where he entertained her during the whole Play. And this, Sir, was the beginning of a Corre&s;pondence between the&s;e two Per&s;ons, which afterwards made a great Noi&s;e in the Town.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, I &s;hall proceed to remind you of &s;omething more extraordinary, and that is, that the Corre&s;pondence between Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and the fore&s;aid Lady was the Occa&s;ion of bringing Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in|to favour with <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> who was pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with that Lady, who was ill treated by her, and who believed Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> his happy Ri|val.
<PB N="218" REF="234">
After the Duke had long &s;ollicited her without obtaining any thing, whether the Relation between them &s;hock'd her, for &s;he was his Cou&s;in-Germain, or whe|ther &s;he apprehended that an Intrigue with a Per&s;on of his Rank and Character, a Per|&s;on upon whom the Eyes of all Men were fix'd, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity in a little time come to the King's Ears, whatever was the Cau&s;e, &s;he refus'd to admit of his Vi&s;its &s;o long, that at la&s;t Indignation, Rage and Di&s;dain took Place of his Love, and he re|&s;olv'd to ruin her. When he had taken this Re&s;olution, he had her &s;o narrowly watch'd by his Spies, that he &s;oon came to the Know|ledge of tho&s;e whom he had rea&s;on to be|lieve his Rivals. And after he knew them, he never fail'd to name them aloud, in or|der to expo&s;e the Lady, to all tho&s;e who frequented him, and among others he us'd to name Mr. <HI>Wycherley.</HI> As &s;oon as it came to the Knowledge of the latter, who had all his Expectations from the Court, he apprehended the Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Report, if it &s;hould reach the King. He applied him&s;elf therefore to <HI>Wilmot</HI> Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and to Sir <HI>Charles Sedley,</HI> and entreated them to remon&s;trate to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> the Mi&s;chief which he was about to do to one who had not the Ho|nour to be known to him, and who had never offended him. Upon their opening
<PB N="219" REF="235">
the Matter to the Duke, he cry'd out im|mediately, <HI>that he did not blame</HI> Wycherley, <HI>he only accus'd his Cou&s;in. Ay, but,</HI> they reply'd, <HI>by rendring him &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch an Intrigue, you are about to ruine him, that is, your Grace is about to ruine a Man with who&s;e Conver&s;ation you would be pleas'd above all things.</HI> Upon this Occa&s;i|on they &s;aid &s;o much of the &s;hining Quali|ties of Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> and of the Charms of his Conver&s;ation, that the Duke, who was as much in love with Wit, as he was with his Kin&s;woman, was impatient till he was brought to &s;up with him, which was in two or three Nights. After Supper Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> who was then in the Height of his Vigor both of Body and Mind, thought him&s;elf oblig'd to exert him&s;elf, and the Duke was charm'd to that degree, that he cry'd out in a Tran&s;port, <HI>By G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> my Cou&s;in is in the right of it</HI>; and from that very Moment made a Friend of a Man whom he believ'd his happy Rival.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave him &s;o|lid &s;en&s;ible Proofs of his E&s;teem and Affe|ction. For as he was at the &s;ame time Ma|&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and Co|lonel of a Regiment; as Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e he made him one of his Equeries, and as Colonel of a Regiment he made him Cap|tain Lieutenant of his own Company, re|&s;igning to him at the &s;ame time his own
<PB N="220" REF="236">
Pay as Captain, and all other Advantages that could be ju&s;tly made of the Company I remember that about that time I, who was come up from the Univer&s;ity to &s;ee my Friends in Town, happen'd to be one Night at the Fountain Tavern in the <HI>Strand,</HI> with the late Dr. <HI>Duke, David Loggen</HI> the Painter, and Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> of whom <HI>Otway</HI> has made honourable Mention in <HI>Ton&s;on</HI>'s fir&s;t Mi&s;cellany, and that after Supper we drank Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Health by the Name of Captain <HI>Wycherley.</HI></P>
<P>He was not long after this in &s;uch high Favour with the King, that that Monarch gave him a Proof of his E&s;teem and Affe|ction, which never any Sovereign Prince before had given to an Author who was only a private Gentleman. Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> happen'd to fall &s;ick of a Feaver at his Lodgings in <HI>Bow-&s;treet, Covent Garden,</HI> during which Sickne&s;s the King did him the Honour to vi&s;it him, when finding his Feaver indeed abated, but his Body ex|tremely weaken'd, and his Spirits mi&s;er|ably &s;hatter'd, he commanded him, as &s;oon as he was able to take a Journey, to go to the South of <HI>France,</HI> believing that nothing would contribute more to the re&s;toring his former Vigour, than the gentle &s;alutiferous Air of <HI>Montpelier</HI> during the Winter Sea|&s;on. At the &s;ame time the King was pleas'd to a&s;&s;ure him, <HI>that as &s;oon as he was ca|pable</HI>

<HI>of taking that Journey, he would or|der five hundred Pounds to be paid him to defray the Expence of it.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> accordingly went into <HI>France</HI> in the beginning of the Winter of 1678, if I am not mi&s;taken, and returned into <HI>England</HI> in the latter end of the Spring of 1679, entirely re&s;tor'd to his former Vigor both of Body and Mind. The King re|ceiv'd him with the utmo&s;t Marks of Fa|vour, and &s;hortly after his Arrival told him that he had a Son, who he was re&s;olv'd &s;hould be educated like the Son of a King, and that he could make Choice of no Man &s;o proper to be his Governor as Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley</HI>; that for that Service he &s;hould have fifteen hundred Pounds a Year paid him, for the Payment of which he &s;hould have an A&s;&s;ignment upon three &s;everal Offices, who&s;e Names I have forgot, to which the King added, <HI>that when the Time came that his Office was to cea&s;e, he would take care to make &s;uch a Provi&s;ion for him as &s;hould &s;et him above the Malice of the World and Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Sir, is it not matter of Won|der, that one of Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s extraordi|nary Merit, who was e&s;teem'd by all the mo&s;t de&s;erving Per&s;ons of the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and in high Fa|vour with the King him&s;elf, &s;hould in a little time, after he had received the&s;e gra|cious
<PB N="222" REF="238">
Offers which &s;eem to have made and to have fix'd his Fortune, be thrown into Pri&s;on for bare &s;even hundred Pounds, and be &s;uffer'd to langui&s;h there during the la&s;t four Years of that Monarch's Reign; for&s;aken by all his Friends at Court and quite aban|don'd by the King? 'Tis no ea&s;ie matter, Sir, to find a more extraordinary In&s;tance of the Vici&s;&s;itude of Human Affairs, and if the Cau&s;e of &s;o &s;trange an Alteration is unknown to you, I dare promi&s;e my &s;elf that you are very de&s;irous to hear it.</P>
<P>It was immediately after Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> had received the&s;e gracious Offers from the King, that the Water-drinking Sea&s;on coming on, he went down to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> to take either the Benefit of the Waters or the Diver&s;ions of the Place, when walking one Day upon the Wells Walk with his Friend Mr. <HI>Fairbeard</HI> of <HI>Grey's-Inn,</HI> ju&s;t as he came up to the Book&s;eller's, my Lady <HI>Drog|heda,</HI> a young Widow, rich, noble, and beautiful, came to the Book&s;eller and en|quir'd for <HI>the Plain Dealer. Madam,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fairbeard, &s;ince you are for the</HI> Plain Dealer, <HI>there he is for you,</HI> pu&s;hing Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> towards her. <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley, this Lady can bear plain Dealing, for &s;he appears to be &s;o accompli&s;h'd, that what would be Compliment &s;aid to others, &s;poke to her would be plain Dealing. No, truly, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Lady, <HI>I am not with|out</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="239">
<HI>my Faults any more than the re&s;t of my Sex, and yet notwith&s;tanding all my Faults, I love plain Dealing, and never am more fond of it than when it tells me of my Faults. Then, Madam,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fairbeard, you and the</HI> Plain Dealer <HI>&s;eem de&s;ign'd by Heaven for each other.</HI> In &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> walk'd with her upon the Walks, waited upon her home, vi&s;ited her daily at her Lodgings, while &s;he &s;taid at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and after &s;he went to <HI>London,</HI> at her Lodgings in <HI>Hatton Garden,</HI> where in a little time he got her Con&s;ent to marry her, which he did, by his Father's Command, without acquaint|ing the King; for it was rea&s;onably &s;up|pos'd, that the Lady having a great Inde|pendant E&s;tate, and noble and powerful Re|lations, the acquainting the King with the intended Marriage might be the likelie&s;t way to prevent it. As &s;oon as the News of it came to Court it was look'd upon as an Affront to the King, and a Contempt of his Maje&s;ty's Offers. And Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Conduct after his Marriage made this be re&s;ented more heinou&s;ly. For &s;eldom or never coming near the Court, he was thought downright ungrateful. But the true Cau&s;e of his Ab&s;ence was not known, and the Court was at that time too much a|larm'd, and in too much Di&s;quiet to enquire into it. In &s;hort, Sir, the Lady was jea|lous of him to Di&s;traction, jealous to that
<PB N="224" REF="240">
degree, that &s;he could not endure that he &s;hould be one Moment out of her Sight. Their Lodgings were in <HI>Bow-&s;treet, Co|vent-Garden,</HI> over-again&s;t the <HI>Cock,</HI> whi|ther if he at any time went with his Friends, he was oblig'd to leave the Windows o|pen, that the Lady might &s;ee there was no Woman in Company, or &s;he would be im|mediately in a downright raving Condition. Whether this outragious Jealou&s;y proceeded from the exce&s;s of her Pa&s;&s;ion, for &s;he lov'd her Husband with the &s;ame Violence with which &s;he had done her Lover, or from the great Things which &s;he had heard reported of his manly Prowe&s;s, which were not an|&s;wer'd by her Experience, or from them both together, Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> thought that he was oblig'd to humour it, and that he could not be too indulgent to a Lady who had be&s;tow'd both her Per&s;on and her For|tune on him. This, Sir, was the Cau&s;e that brought Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> all at once in|to the utmo&s;t Di&s;grace with the Court, who&s;e Favour and Affection but ju&s;t before he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the highe&s;t Degree. And the&s;e, Sir, are the Particulars of Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley</HI>'s Life, which &s;eem either to have &s;lipt from your Memory, or to have e&s;ca|ped your Knowledge.</P>
