<P>THAT an Ab&s;olute Pa&s;&s;ive Obedi|ence ought not to be paid any Civil Power: But that Submi&s;&s;ion to Govern|ment &s;hou'd be Mea&s;ured and Limited by the Public Good of the Society; and that therefore Subjects may Lawfully Re&s;i&s;t the Supreme Authority, in tho&s;e Ca&s;es where the Public Good &s;hall plainly &s;eem to re|quire it: Nay, that it is their Duty to do &s;o, ina&s;much as they are all under an indi|&s;pen&s;able Obligation to promote the Common Intere&s;t: The&s;e and the like Notions, which I cannot help thinking Pernicious to Man|kind and Repugnant to <HI>Right Rea&s;on,</HI> ha|ving of late Years been Indu&s;triou&s;ly Culti|vated, and &s;et in the mo&s;t Advantageous Lights by Men of Parts and Learning, it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to Arm the Youth of our Univer&s;ity again&s;t them, and take care they go into the World well Principled; I do not mean Ob&s;tinately Prejudic'd in favour of
<PB REF="3">
a Party, but from an early Acquaintance with their Duty, and the clear Rational Grounds of it, Determin'd to &s;uch Practi|ces as may &s;peak them <HI>Good Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Loyal Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>In this View, I made three Di&s;cour&s;es not many Months &s;ince in the <HI>College-Chapel,</HI> which &s;ome who heard them thought it might be of U&s;e to make more Public: And indeed, the fal&s;e Accounts that are gone abroad concerning them, have made it nece&s;&s;ary. Accordingly I now &s;end them into the World under the Form of one entire Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To Conclude; As in Writing the&s;e Thoughts it was my Endeavour to Pre&s;erve that Cool and Impartial Temper which be|comes every &s;incere Enquirer after Truth, &s;o I heartily wi&s;h they may be Read with the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P N="1">I. IT is not my De&s;ign to enquire into the particular Nature of the Government and Con&s;titution of the&s;e Kingdoms; much le&s;s to pretend to determine con|cerning the Merits of the different Parties now reigning in the State. Tho&s;e Topicks I profe&s;s to lie out of my Sphere, and they will probably be thought by mo&s;t Men, improper to be Treated of in an Audience almo&s;t wholly made up of young Per&s;ons, &s;et apart from the bu&s;ine&s;s and noi&s;e of the World, for their more convenient in&s;truction in Learning and Piety. But &s;urely it is in no re|&s;pect un&s;uitable to the circum&s;tances of this place to inculcate and explain every branch of the Law of Nature; or tho&s;e Virtues and Duties which are equally binding in every Kingdom or Society of Men under Heaven; and of this kind I take to be that Chri&s;tian Duty of not Re&s;i&s;ting the Supreme Power implied in my Text. <HI>Who&s;oever Re&s;i&s;teth the Power, Re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God.</HI> In Treating on which Words I &s;hall ob&s;erve the following Method.</P>
<P N="2">II. Fir&s;t, I &s;hall endeavour to prove, That there is an ab&s;olute unlimited Non-Re&s;i&s;tance or Pa&s;&s;ive
<PB N="2" REF="5">
Obedience due to the Supreme Civil Power, where|ever placed in any Nation. Secondly, I &s;hall en|quire into the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of the contra|ry Opinion. Thirdly, I &s;hall con&s;ider the Obje|ctions drawn from the pretended con&s;equences of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance to the Supreme Power. In hand|ling the&s;e Points, I intend not to build on the Au|thority of Holy Scripture, but altogether on the Principles of Rea&s;on common to all mankind; and that, becau&s;e there are &s;ome very rational and learned Men, who being verily per&s;waded, an ab|&s;olute pa&s;&s;ive Subjection to any earthly Power, is repugnant to right Rea&s;on, can never bring them|&s;elves to admit &s;uch an Interpretation of Holy Scripture (however natural and obvious from the words) as &s;hall make that a part of Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, which &s;eems to them in it &s;elf manife&s;tly ab&s;urd, and de&s;tructive of the Original inherent Rights of humane Nature.</P>
<P N="3">III. I do not mean to Treat of that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which Men are either in Duty or Prudence obliged to pay inferior or executive Powers; neither &s;hall I con&s;ider where, or in what Per&s;ons the Supreme or Legi&s;lative Power is lodged in this or that Go|vernment. Only thus much I &s;hall take for gran|ted, That there is in every Civil Community, &s;ome where or other, placed a Supreme Power of making Laws, and enforcing the Ob&s;ervation of them. The fulfilling of tho&s;e Laws, either by a punctual performance of what is enjoyned in them, or, if that be incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on or Con|&s;cience, by a patient Submi&s;&s;ion to whatever Pe|nalties the Supreme Power hath annexed to the Neglect or Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of them, is termed <HI>Loyal|ty</HI>; as on the other hand, the making U&s;e of Force and open Violence, either to with&s;tand the exe|cution
<PB N="3" REF="6">
of the Laws, or ward off the Penalties ap|pointed by the Supreme Power, is properly Named <HI>Rebellion.</HI> Now to make it evident, that every de|gree of Rebellion is Criminal in the Subject; I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place endeavour to prove that Loy|alty is a natural or moral Duty; and Di&s;loyalty or Rebellion in the mo&s;t &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e, ae Vice or Breach of the Law of Nature. And Se|condly, I propo&s;e to &s;hew that the Prohibitions of Vice, or Negative Precepts of the Law of Nature, as, Thou &s;halt not commit Adultery, Thou &s;halt not For&s;wear thy &s;elf, Thou &s;halt not Re&s;i&s;t the Su|preme Power, and the like, ought to be taken in a mo&s;t ab&s;olute, nece&s;&s;ary, and immutable Sen&s;e: In&s;omuch, that the attainment of the greate&s;t Good, or deliverance from the greate&s;t Evil, that can be|fal any Man or number of Men in this Life, may not ju&s;tifie the lea&s;t Violation of them. Fir&s;t then I am to &s;hew that Loyalty is a Moral Duty, and Di&s;loyalty or Rebellion in the mo&s;t &s;trict and pro|per Sen&s;e a Vice, or breach of the Law of Nature.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Tho' it be a Point agreed among&s;t all Wi&s;e Men, that there are certain Moral Rules or Laws of Nature, which carry with them an eternal and indi&s;pen&s;able Obligation; yet concerning the pro|per Methods for di&s;covering tho&s;e Laws, and di|&s;tingui&s;hing them from others dependent on the Humour and Di&s;cretion of Men, there are various Opinions; &s;ome direct us to look for them in the Divine Ideas, others in the natural In&s;criptions on the Mind; &s;ome derive them from the Authority of Learned Men, and the Univer&s;al Agreement and Con&s;ent of Nations. La&s;tly, others hold that they are only to be di&s;covered by the deductions of Rea&s;on. The three fir&s;t Methods mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd to labour under great Difficulties, and the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
la&s;t has not, that I know, been any where di&s;tinct|ly explained, or treated of &s;o fully as the impor|tance of the Subject doth de&s;erve. I hope there|fore it will be Pardon'd, if in a Di&s;cour&s;e of Pa&s;|&s;ive Obedience, in order to lay the Foundation of that Duty the deeper, we make &s;ome Enquiry into the Origine, Nature, and Obligation of Moral Duties in general, and the <HI>Criterions</HI> whereby they are to be known.</P>
<P N="5">V. Self-Love being a Principle of all others the mo&s;t Univer&s;al, and the mo&s;t deeply engraven in our Hearts, it is natural for us to regard things, as they are fitted to augment or impair our own Hap|pine&s;s; and accordingly we denominate them <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil.</HI> Our Judgment is ever employ'd in di|&s;tingui&s;hing between the&s;e two, and it is the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of our Lives, to endeavour, by a proper application of our Faculties, to procure the one and avoid the other. At our fir&s;t coming into the World, we are entirely guided by the Impre&s;&s;ions of Sen&s;e, &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure being the infallible Cha|racteri&s;tic of pre&s;ent Good, as Pain is of Evil. But by degrees, as we grow up in our acquaintance with the Nature of Things, experience informs us that pre&s;ent Good is afterwards oft attended with a greater Evil; and on the other &s;ide, that pre&s;ent Evil is not le&s;s frequently the occa&s;ion of procuring to us a greater future Good. Be&s;ides, as the No|bler Faculties of the human Soul begin to di&s;play them&s;elves, they di&s;cover to us Goods far more excellent than tho&s;e which affect the Sen&s;es. Hence an alteration is wrought in our Judgments, we no longer comply with the fir&s;t &s;olicitations of Sen&s;e, but &s;tay to con&s;ider the remote con&s;equences of an Action, what Good may be hoped, or what Evil feared from it, according to the wonted Cour&s;e of
<PB N="5" REF="8">
things. This obliges us frequently to overlook pre&s;ent momentary Enjoyments, when they come in competition with greater and more la&s;ting Goods, tho' too far off, or of too refin'd a Nature to affect our Sen&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">VI. But as the whole Earth, and the entire du|ration of tho&s;e peri&s;hing Things contained in it, is altogether incon&s;iderable, or in the Prophet's ex|pre&s;&s;ive Stile, <HI>le&s;s than nothing</HI> in re&s;pect of Eternity, who &s;ees not that every rea&s;onable Man ought &s;o to frame his Actions, as that they may mo&s;t effe|ctually contribute to promote his Eternal Intere&s;t? And &s;ince it is a Truth evident by the Light of Na|ture, that there is a Sovereign Omni&s;cient Spirit, who alone can make us for ever Happy, or for ever Mi&s;erable; it plainly follows, that a Confor|mity to his Will, and not any Pro&s;pect of Tem|poral Advantage, is the &s;ole Rule whereby every Man who acts up to the Principles of Rea&s;on, mu&s;t Govern and Square his Actions. The &s;ame Conclu&s;ion doth likewi&s;e evidently Re&s;ult from the Relation which God bears to his Creatures. God alone is Maker and Pre&s;erver of all Things. He is therefore with the mo&s;t undoubted Right the great Legi&s;lator of the World; and Mankind are by all the Ties of Duty, no le&s;s than Intere&s;t, bound to Obey his Laws.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Hence we &s;hould above all things endea|vour to trace out the Divine Will, or the general de&s;ign of Providence with regard to Mankind, and the Methods mo&s;t directly tending to the accom|pli&s;hment of that de&s;ign, and this &s;eems the ge|nuine and proper way for di&s;covering the Laws of Nature. For Laws being Rules directive of our Actions to the end intended by the Legi&s;lator, in
<PB N="6" REF="9">
order to attain the Knowledge of God's Laws, we ought fir&s;t to enquire what that end is, which he de&s;igns &s;hould be carried on by human Actions. Now, as God is a Being of Infinite Goodne&s;s, it is plain the end he propo&s;es is <HI>Good.</HI> But God en|joying in him&s;elf all po&s;&s;ible Perfection, it fol|lows that it is not his own Good, but that of his Creatures. Again, the Moral Actions of Men are entirely terminated within them&s;elves, &s;o as to have no influence on the other orders of Intelli|gences or rea&s;onable Creatures: The end there|fore to be procured by them, can be no other than the good of Men. But as nothing in a natural State can entitle one Man more than another to the favour of God, except only Moral Goodne&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ting in a Conformity to the Laws of God, doth pre&s;uppo&s;e the being of &s;uch Laws, and Law ever &s;uppo&s;ing an end, to which it guides our Actions, it follows that Antecedent to the end propo&s;ed by God, no di&s;tinction can be conceived between Men; that end therefore it &s;elf or general de&s;ign of Providence is not determined or limited by any Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons: It is not therefore the private Good of this or that Man, Nation or Age, but the general well-being of all Men, of all Nations, of all Ages of the World, which God de&s;igns &s;hould be procured by the con|curring Actions of each individual. Having thus di&s;cover'd the great end, to which all Moral Obli|gations are Subordinate; it remains, that we en|quire what Methods are nece&s;&s;ary for the obtain|ing that End.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The well-being of Mankind mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be carried on one of the&s;e two ways: Either fir&s;t, without the injunction of any certain uni|ver&s;al Rules of Morality, only by obliging every
<PB N="7" REF="10">
one upon each particular Occa&s;ion, to con&s;ult the publick Good, and always to do that, which to him &s;hall &s;eem in the pre&s;ent time and circum&s;tan|ces, mo&s;t to conduce to it. Or Secondly, by en|joining the Ob&s;ervation of &s;ome determinate, e|&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws, which, if Univer&s;ally practis'd, have from the Nature of things an E&s;&s;ential fit|ne&s;s to procure the well-being of Mankind; tho' in their particular Application, they are &s;ome|times through untoward accidents, and the per|ver&s;e irregularity of human Wills, the occa&s;ions of great Sufferings, and Misfortunes, it may be, to very many good Men. Again&s;t the former of the&s;e Methods there lie &s;everal &s;trong Objections. For brevity I &s;hall mention only two.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Fir&s;t, it will thence follow, that the Be&s;t Men for want of Judgment, and the Wi&s;e&s;t for want of knowing all the hidden circum&s;tances and con&s;equences of an Action, may very often be at a lo&s;s how to behave them&s;elves; which they would not be, in ca&s;e they judged of each Action, by comparing it with &s;ome particular Precept, rather than by examining the Good or Evil which in that &s;ingle in&s;tance it tends to pro|cure: It being far more ea&s;y to Judge with cer|tainty, whether &s;uch or &s;uch an Action be a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of this or that Precept, than whether it will be attended with more good or ill Con&s;e|quences. In &s;hort, to calculate the events of each particular Action is impo&s;&s;ible, and tho' it were not, would yet take up too much time to be of U&s;e in the affairs of Life. Secondly, if that Me|thod be ob&s;erv'd, it will follow that we can have no &s;ure Standard, to which comparing the Acti|ons of another, we may pronounce them good or bad, Virtues or Vices. For &s;ince the mea&s;ure and
<PB N="8" REF="11">
rule of every good Man's Actions is &s;uppo&s;ed to be nothing el&s;e, but his own private di&s;intere&s;ted Opinion, of what makes mo&s;t for the publick Good at that juncture: And &s;ince this Opinion mu&s;t unavoidably in different Men, from their parti|cular Views and Circum&s;tances, be very different: It is impo&s;&s;ible to know, whether any one in&s;tance of Parricide or Perjury, for example, be Criminal. The Man may have had his Rea&s;ons for it, and that which in me would have been a heinous Sin, may be in him a Duty. Every Man's particular Rule is buried in his own Brea&s;t, invi&s;ible to all but him&s;elf, who therefore can only tell whether he Ob&s;erves it or no. And &s;ince that Rule is fitted to particular Occa&s;ions, it mu&s;t ever change as they do: Hence it is not only various in different Men, but in one and the &s;ame Man at different times.</P>
<P N="10">X. From all which it follows, there can be no Harmony or Agreement between the Actions of good Men: No apparent Steddine&s;s or Con&s;i&s;ten|cy of one Man with him&s;elf, no adhering to Principles: The be&s;t Actions may be Condemn'd, and the mo&s;t Villanous meet with Applau&s;e. In a Word, there en&s;ues the mo&s;t horrible confu&s;ion of Vice and Virtue, Sin and Duty, that can po&s;|&s;ibly be imagined. It follows therefore that the great end, to which God requires the concurrence of human Actions, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be carried on by the &s;econd Method propo&s;ed, namely, the ob&s;ervation of certain, univer&s;al, determinate Rules or Moral Precepts, which, in their own Nature, have a nece&s;&s;ity tendency to promote the Well being of the Sum of Mankind, taking in all Nations and Ages, from the beginning to the end of the World.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="9" REF="12">
XI. Hence upon an equal comprehen&s;ive Sur|vey of the general Nature, the Pa&s;&s;ions, Intere&s;ts, and mutual Re&s;pects of Mankind; what&s;oever practical Propo&s;ition doth to right Rea&s;on evi|dently appear to have a nece&s;&s;ary connexion with the univer&s;al Well-being included in it, is to be look'd upon as enjoined by the Will of God. For he that willeth the end, doth will the nece&s;&s;ary means conducive to that end; but it hath been &s;hewn, that God willeth the Univer&s;al Well-be|ing of Mankind &s;hould be promoted by the con|currence of each particular Per&s;on; therefore e|very &s;uch practical Propo&s;ition, nece&s;&s;arily tend|ing thereto, is to be e&s;teemed a Decree of God, and is con&s;equently a Law to Man.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The&s;e Propo&s;itions are called <HI>Laws of Na|ture,</HI> becau&s;e they are univer&s;al, and do not de|rive their Obligation from any Civil Sanction, but immediately from the Author of Nature him|&s;elf. They are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;tamped on the Mind,</HI> to be <HI>engraven on the Tables of the Heart,</HI> becau&s;e they are well known to Mankind, and &s;ugge&s;ted and inculcated by Con&s;cience. La&s;tly, they are term|ed <HI>Eternal Rules of Rea&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e they nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the Nature of Things, and may be demon&s;trated by the infallible deductions of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. And notwith&s;tanding that the&s;e Rules are too often, either by the unhappy concurrence of events, or more e&s;pecially by the wickedne&s;s of perver&s;e Men, who will not Conform to them, made accidental cau&s;es of Mi&s;ery to tho&s;e good Men, who do; yet this doth not vacate their Ob|ligation, they are ever to be e&s;teemed the fixed
<PB N="10" REF="13">
unalterable Standards of Moral Good and Evil; no private Intere&s;t, no Love of Friends, no Re|gard to the publick Good, &s;hould make us depart from them. Hence, when any doubt ari&s;es con|cerning the Morality of an Action, 'tis plain, this cannot be determined by computing the publick Good, which in that particular Ca&s;e it is attend|ed with, but only by comparing it with the Eter|nal Law of Rea&s;on. He who &s;quares his actions by this Rule, can never do ami&s;s, tho' thereby he &s;hould bring him&s;elf to Poverty, Death, or Di&s;|grace: No, not tho' he &s;hould involve his Fami|ly, his Friends, his Country in all tho&s;e Evils, which are accounted the Greate&s;t, and mo&s;t in&s;up|portable to human Nature. Tenderne&s;s and Be|nevolence of Temper are often motives to the be&s;t and greate&s;t Actions; but we mu&s;t not make them the &s;ole Rule of our Actions; they are Pa&s;|&s;ions rooted in our nature, and like all other Pa&s;|&s;ions mu&s;t be re&s;train'd and kept under, other|wi&s;e they may po&s;&s;ibly betray us into as great Enor|mities, as any other unbridled Lu&s;t. Nay, they are more dangerous than other Pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;omuch as they are more plau&s;ible, and apt to dazzle, and corrupt the Mind, with the appearance of Good|ne&s;s and Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. For the Illu&s;tration of what has been &s;aid, it will not be ami&s;s, if from the Moral we turn our Eyes on the Natural World. <HI>Homo ortus e&s;t</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Balbus</HI> in <HI>Cicero</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Natura Deorum,</HI> Lib. 2.</NOTE>) <HI>ad Mundum contem|plandum, &amp; imitandum</HI>: And &s;urely, it is not po&s;|&s;ible for free intellectual Agents to propo&s;e a no|bler Pattern for their imitation than Nature, which
<PB N="11" REF="14">
is nothing el&s;e but a &s;eries of free Actions produced by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Agent. But it is evident that tho&s;e Actions are not adapted to particular Views, but all conformed to certain general Rules, which being collected from Ob&s;ervation, are by Philo&s;ophers termed Laws of Nature. And the&s;e indeed are excellently &s;uited to promote the gene|ral well-being of the Creation: But what from ca&s;ual combinations of events, and what from the voluntary motions of Animals, it often falls out, that the natural good not only of private Men, but of entire Cities and Nations, wou'd be better pro|moted by a particular Su&s;pen&s;ion, or Contradicti|on, than an exact Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e Laws. Yet for all that, Nature &s;till takes its cour&s;e; nay, it is plain that Plagues, Famines, Inundations, Earth|quakes, with an infinite variety of Pains and Sor|rows; in a word all kinds of Calamities publick and private do ari&s;e from a uniform &s;teddy ob&s;er|vation of tho&s;e general Laws, which are once e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by the Author of Nature, and which he will not change or deviate from upon any of tho&s;e Ac|counts, how wi&s;e or benevolent &s;oever it may be thought by fooli&s;h Men to do &s;o. As for the Mi|racles Recorded in Scripture, they were always wrought for Confirmation of &s;ome Doctrine or Mi&s;&s;ion from God, and not for the &s;ake of the particular natural goods, as Health or Life, which &s;ome Men might have reaped from them. From all which it &s;eems &s;ufficiently plain, that we can|not be at a lo&s;s, which way to determine, in ca&s;e we think God's own Methods the propere&s;t to ob|tain his ends, and that it is our Duty to Copy af|ter them, &s;o far as the frailty of our Nature will permit.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="12" REF="15">
XV. Thus far in general, of the nature and ne|ce&s;&s;ity of moral Rules, and the <HI>Criterion</HI> or Mark whereby they may be known. As for the particu|lars, from the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, the principal of them may without much difficulty be deduced. It hath been &s;hewn that the Law of Nature is a Sy&s;tem of &s;uch Rules or Precepts, as that if they be all of them, at all times, in all places, and by all Men ob&s;erved, they will nece&s;&s;arily promote the well-being of Mankind, &s;o far as it is attainable by human Actions. Now, let any one who hath the u&s;e of Rea&s;on, take but an impartial Survey of the general frame and circum&s;tances of human Na|ture, and it will appear plainly to him, that the con&s;tant ob&s;ervation of Truth, for in&s;tance, of Ju&s;tice, and Cha&s;tity, hath a nece&s;&s;ary connexion with their univer&s;al well-being, that therefore they are to be e&s;teemed Virtues or Duties, and that, <HI>Thou &s;halt not For&s;wear thy &s;elf, Thou &s;halt not Commit Adultery, Thou &s;halt not Steal,</HI> are &s;o many unaltera|ble Moral Rules, which to violate in the lea&s;t de|gree is Vice or Sin. I &s;ay, the agreement of the&s;e particular practical Propo&s;itions, with the Defini|tion, or <HI>Criterion</HI> premi&s;ed, doth &s;o clearly re&s;ult from the nature of Things, that it were a needle&s;s digre&s;&s;ion, in this place to enlarge upon it. And from the &s;ame Principle, by the very &s;ame Rea|&s;oning, it follows that Loyalty is a moral Virtue, and, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Re&s;i&s;t the Supreme Power,</HI> a Rule or Law of Nature, the lea&s;t breach whereof hath the inherent &s;tain of Moral Turpitude.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The Mi&s;eries in&s;eparable from a State of Anarchy are ea&s;ily imagined. So in&s;ufficient is the Wit or Strength of any &s;ingle Man, either to avert the Evils, or procure the Ble&s;&s;ings of Life, and &s;o

apt are the Wills of different Per&s;ons to contradict and thwart each other, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry, &s;everal independent Powers be combin'd toge|ther, under the Direction (if I may &s;o &s;peak) of one and the &s;ame Will, I mean the Law of the Society. Without this there is no Politene&s;s, no Order, no Peace among Men, but the World is one great heap of Mi&s;ery and Confu&s;ion; the Strong as well as the Weak, the Wi&s;e as well as the Fooli&s;h, &s;tanding on all &s;ides expo&s;ed to all tho&s;e Calamities, which Man can be liable to in a State where he has no other Security, than the not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any thing which may rai&s;e Envy or De&s;ire in another. A State! by &s;o much more in|eligible than that of Brutes, as a rea&s;onable Crea|ture hath a greater reflexion and fore&s;ight of Mi|&s;eries than they. From all which it plainly fol|lows, that Loyalty or Submi&s;&s;ion to the Supreme Civil Authority, hath, if univer&s;ally practis'd in conjunction with all other Virtues, a nece&s;&s;ary con|nexion with the well-being of the whole Sum of Mankind; and by con&s;equence, if the <HI>Criterion</HI> we have laid down, be True, it is, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, a Moral Duty, or branch of Natural Reli|gion. And therefore, the lea&s;t degree of Rebel|lion is with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s and propriety, a <HI>Sin</HI>: Not only in Chri&s;tians, but al&s;o in tho&s;e who haxe the Light of Rea&s;on alone for their Guide. Nay, upon a thorough and impartial View, this Submi&s;&s;ion will, I think, appear one of the very fir&s;t and fundamental Laws of Nature, ina&s;much as it is Civil Government which ordains and marks out the various Relations between Men, and regulates Property, thereby giving Scope and lay|ing a foundation for the exerci&s;e of all other Du|ties. And in Truth, whoever con&s;iders the Con|dition of Man, will &s;carce conceive it po&s;&s;ible that
<PB N="14" REF="17">
the practice of any one Moral Virtue &s;hou'd Ob|tain, in the naked, forlorn State of Nature.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. But &s;ince it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that in all Ca&s;es our Actions come not within the Direction of certain fixed Moral Rules, it may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;till que&s;tioned, whether Obedience to the Su|preme Power be not one of tho&s;e exempted Ca&s;es, and con&s;equently to be regulated by the Prudence and Di&s;cretion of every &s;ingle Per&s;on, rather than adju&s;ted to the Rule of ab&s;olute Non-Re&s;i&s;tance. I &s;hall therefore endeavour to make it yet more plain, that, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Re&s;i&s;t the Supreme Power,</HI> is an undoubted Precept of Morality; as will appear from the following Con&s;iderations. Fir&s;t then, Submi&s;&s;ion to Government is a Point <HI>important</HI> enough to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Moral Rule. Things of in&s;ignificant and trifling Concern are, for that very Rea&s;on, exempted from the Rules of Mora|lity. But Government, on which &s;o much depend the Peace, Order, and Well-being of Mankind, cannot &s;urely be thought of too &s;mall Importance to be Secur'd and Guarded by a Moral Rule. Go|vernment, I &s;ay, which is it &s;elf the principal Source under Heaven, of tho&s;e particular Advan|tages, for the procurement and con&s;ervation whereof, &s;everal unque&s;tionable Moral Rules were pre&s;cribed to Men.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Secondly, Obedience to Government is a Ca&s;e <HI>Univer&s;al</HI> enough to fall under the Di|rection of a Law of Nature. Numberle&s;s Rules there may be for regulating Affairs of great Con|cernment, at certain Junctures, and to &s;ome parti|cular Per&s;ons or Societies, which notwith&s;tanding are not to be e&s;teemed Moral or Natural Laws, but may be either totally abrogated or di&s;pen&s;ed with;
<PB N="15" REF="18">
becau&s;e the private Ends they were intended to promote, re&s;pect only &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, as engaged in Relations not founded in the general Nature of Man, who on various Occa&s;ions, and in different Po&s;tures of Things, may pro&s;ecute their own De&s;igns by different Mea&s;ures, as in Humane Prudence &s;hall &s;eem convenient. But what rela|tion is there more exten&s;ive and univer&s;al than that of Subject and Law? This is confin'd to no particular Age or Climate, but univer&s;ally obtains at all Times, and in all Places, wherever Men live in a &s;tate exalted above that of Brutes. It is there|fore evident, that the Rule forbidding Re&s;i&s;tance to the Law or Supreme Power, is not upon pre|tence of any defect in point of <HI>Univer&s;ality,</HI> to be excluded from the Number of the Laws of Nature.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. Thirdly, There is another Con&s;ideration, which confirms the Nece&s;&s;ity of admitting this Rule for a Moral or Natural Law; namely, becau&s;e the Ca&s;e it regards is of too <HI>Nice</HI> and <HI>Difficult</HI> a Na|ture to be left to the Judgment and Determination of each private Per&s;on. Some Ca&s;es there are &s;o plain and obvious to judge of, that they may &s;afely be tru&s;ted to the Prudence of every rea&s;onable Man; but in all In&s;tances, to determine, whether a Civil Law is fitted to promote the Publick Intere&s;t; or whether Submi&s;&s;ion or Re&s;i&s;tance will prove mo&s;t advantageous in the Con&s;equence; or when it is, that the general Good of a Nation may require an Alteration of Government, either in its Form, or in the Hands which Admini&s;ter it: the&s;e are Points too arduous and intricate, and which require too great a degree of Parts, Lei&s;ure, and liberal Edu|cation, as well as Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and thorough Knowledge in the particular State of a Kingdom, for every Subject to take upon him the Determi|nation
<PB N="16" REF="19">
of them. From which it follows, that up|on this account al&s;o, Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, which, in the main, no body can deny to be a mo&s;t profita|ble and whol&s;ome Duty, ought not to be limited by the Judgment of private Per&s;ons to particular Occa&s;ions, but e&s;teemed a mo&s;t Sacred Law of Nature.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The foregoing Arguments do, I think, make it manife&s;t, that the Precept again&s;t Rebel|lion is on a Level with other Moral Rules. Which will yet farther appear from this fourth and la&s;t Con&s;ideration. It cannot be denied, that Right Rea&s;on doth require &s;ome common &s;tated Rule or Mea&s;ure, whereby Subjects ought to &s;hape their Submi&s;&s;ion to the Supreme Power. Since any cla&s;hing or di&s;agreement in this Point mu&s;t una|voidably tend to weaken, and di&s;&s;olve the Society And it is unavoidable, that there &s;hou'd be great cla&s;hing, where it is left to the brea&s;t of each In|dividual to &s;uit his Fancy with a different mea&s;ure of Obedience. But this common &s;tated Mea&s;ure mu&s;t be either the general Precept forbidding Re|&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e the publick Good of the whole Nation: Which la&s;t, tho' it is allowed to be in it &s;elf &s;omething certain and determinate; yet, for|a&s;much as Men can regulate their Conduct only by what appears to them, whether in Truth it be what it appears or no; and &s;ince the Pro&s;pects Men form to them&s;elves of a Country's publick Good, are commonly as various as its Land&s;chapes which meet the Eye in &s;everal Situations: It clear|ly follows, that to make the publick Good the Rule of Obedience, is in effect, not to e&s;tabli&s;h any de|terminate, agreed, common Mea&s;ure of Loyalty, but to leave every Subject to the Guidance of his own particular mutable Fancy.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="17" REF="20">
XXI. From all which Arguments and Con&s;ide|rations it is a mo&s;t evident Conclu&s;ion, That the Law prohibiting Rebellion is in &s;trict Truth a Law of Nature, Univer&s;al Rea&s;on, and Morality. But to this, it will perhaps be objected by &s;ome, that whatever may be concluded with regard to Re&s;i|&s;tance, from the tedious Deductions of Rea&s;on, yet there is I know not what turpitude and de|formity in &s;ome Actions, which at fir&s;t Blu&s;h, &s;hews them to be vicious; but they, not finding them|&s;elves &s;truck with &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible and immediate Horror at the thought of Rebellion, cannot think it on a level with other Crimes again&s;t Nature. To which I an&s;wer, that it is True, there are cer|tain natural Antipathies implanted in the Soul, which are ever the mo&s;t la&s;ting and in&s;urmounta|ble; but as Cu&s;tom is a &s;econd Nature, whatever Aver&s;ions are from our early Childhood continu|ally infu&s;ed into the Mind, give it &s;o deep a &s;tain as is &s;carce to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural Com|plexion. And as it doth hence follow, that to make all the inward horrors of Soul, pa&s;s for in|fallible marks of Sin, were the way to e&s;tabli&s;h Error and Super&s;tition in the World: So, on the other hand, to &s;uppo&s;e all Actions lawful, which are unattended with tho&s;e &s;tarts of Nature, wou'd prove of the la&s;t dangerous con&s;equence to Vir|tue and Morality. For the&s;e pertaining to us as Men, we mu&s;t not be directed in re&s;pect of them, by any emotions in our Blood and Spirits, but by the dictates of &s;ober and impartial Rea&s;on. And if there be any, who find they have a le&s;s Abhor|rence of Rebellion than of other Villanies, all that can be inferred from it, is, that this part of their Duty was not &s;o much reflected on, or &s;o early and frequently inculcated into their Hearts, as it ought
<PB N="18" REF="21">
to have been. Since without que&s;tion there are other Men who have as thorough an Aver&s;ion for that, as for any other Crime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Il di&s;oit ordinairement qu'il avoit un au&s;&s;i grand eloignement pour ce pech&eacute; la que pour a&s;&s;a&s;&s;iner le mond, ou pour voler &s;ur les grands chemins, &amp; qu'enfin il ny avoit rien qui fut plus contraire a &s;on naturel.</HI> He (<HI>Mr. Pa&s;cal</HI>) u&s;ed to &s;ay he had as great an Ab|horrence of Rebellion as of Murder, or Robbing on the Way, and that there was nothing more Shocking to his Nature. <HI>Vie de Mr. Pa&s;cal,</HI> pag. 44</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. Again, it will probably be objected, that Submi&s;&s;ion to Government differs from moral Du|ties, in that it is founded in a Contract, which up|on the Violation of its Conditions doth of cour&s;e become void, and in &s;uch Ca&s;e Rebellion is law|ful; it hath not therefore the Nature of a Sin or Crime, which is in it &s;elf ab&s;olutely unlawful, and mu&s;t be committed on no Pretext what&s;oever. Now, pa&s;&s;ing over all Enquiry and Di&s;pute con|cerning the fir&s;t ob&s;cure Ri&s;e of Government, I ob&s;erve its being founded on a Contract, may be under&s;tood in a twofold Sen&s;e, either, fir&s;t, that &s;everal independent Per&s;ons finding the un&s;uffera|ble Inconvenience of a State of Anarchy, where every one was governed by his own Will, con&s;ent|ed and agreed together to pay an ab&s;olute Submi&s;|&s;ion, to the Decrees of &s;ome certain Legi&s;lative; which, tho &s;ometimes they may bear hard on the Subject, yet, mu&s;t &s;urely prove ea&s;ier to be go|verned by, than the violent Humours, and un&s;ted|dy oppo&s;ite Wills of a multitude of Savages. And in ca&s;e we admit &s;uch a Compact to have been the original Foundation of Civil Government; it mu&s;t even on that Suppo&s;ition be held Sacred and Invi|olable.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="19" REF="22">
XXIII. Or Secondly, it is meant that Subjects have contracted with their re&s;pective Sovereigns or Legi&s;lators, to pay, not an ab&s;olute, but conditi|onal and limited Submi&s;&s;ion to their Laws, that is, upon Condition, and &s;o far forth, as the Ob&s;erva|tion of them &s;hall contribute to the publick Good: Re&s;erving &s;till to them&s;elves a Right of Superin|tending the Laws, and Judging whether they are fitted to promote the publick Good or no. And (in ca&s;e they or any of them think it needful) of Re|&s;i&s;ting the higher Powers, and changing the whole Frame of Government by Force; which is a Right that all Mankind, whether &s;ingle Per&s;ons or Socie|ties, have over tho&s;e that are deputed by them. But in this Sen&s;e a Contract cannot be admitted for the Ground and Mea&s;ure of civil Obedience, except one of the&s;e two Things be clearly &s;hewn: Either, Fir&s;t, That &s;uch a Contract is an expre&s;s known Part of the Fundamental Con&s;titution of a Nati|on, equally allowed and unque&s;tioned by all as the common Law of the Land. Or, Secondly, If it be not expre&s;s, that it is at lea&s;t nece&s;&s;arily im|plied in the very Nature or Notion of Civil Poli|ty, which &s;uppo&s;es it is a thing manife&s;tly ab&s;urd, that a Number of Men &s;hou'd be oblig'd to live under an unlimited Subjection to Civil Law, rather than continue wild and independent of each other. But to me it &s;eems mo&s;t evident, that neither of tho&s;e Points will ever be proved.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. And till they are proved beyond all Contradiction, the Doctrine built upon them, ought to be rejected with Dete&s;tation. Since to repre&s;ent the Higher Powers as Deputies of the People, manife&s;tly tends to dimini&s;h that Awe and Reverence, which all good Men &s;hould have for
<PB N="20" REF="23">
the Laws and Government of their Countrey. And to &s;peak of a conditioned, limited Loyalty, and I know not what vague and undetermined Contracts, is a mo&s;t effectual Means to loo&s;en the Bands of Civil Society; than which nothing can be of more mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence to Mankind. But after all, if there be any Man, who either cannot or will not &s;ee the Ab&s;urdity and pernici|ou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e Notions, he wou'd, I doubt not, be convinced with a Witne&s;s, in ca&s;e they &s;hould once become current, and every private Man take it in his Head to believe them true, and put them in practice.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. But there &s;till remains an Objection, which hath the Appearance of &s;ome Strength again&s;t what has been &s;aid. Namely, That where|as Civil Polity is a thing entirely of human In&s;ti|tution, it &s;eems contrary to Rea&s;on, to make Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to it part of the Law of Nature, and not rather of the Civil Law. For how can it be ima|gin'd that Nature &s;hou'd dictate or pre&s;cribe a na|tural Law about a thing, which depends on the Arbitrary Humour of Men, not only as to its Kind or Form, which is very various and mutable, but even as to its Exi&s;tence; there being no where to be found a Civil Government &s;et up by Nature. In an&s;wer to this, I ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that mo&s;t Moral Precepts do pre&s;uppo&s;e &s;ome voluntary Actions, or Pacts of Men, and are neverthele&s;s e&s;teemed Laws of Nature. Property is a&s;&s;igned, the Signification of Words a&s;certained, and Matrimony contracted by the Agreement and Con&s;ent of Mankind; and for all that it is not doubted, whether Theft, Fal&s;e|hood and Adultery be prohibited by the Law of Nature. Loyalty, therefore, tho it &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e and be the Re&s;ult of human In&s;titutions, may,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
for all that, be of natural Obligation. I &s;ay, Se|condly, that, notwith&s;tanding particular Societies are formed by Men, and are not in all Places alike, as Things e&s;teemed natural are wont to be, yet there is implanted in Mankind a natural Tendency or Di&s;po&s;ition to a &s;ocial Life. I call it <HI>natural,</HI> be|cau&s;e it is univer&s;al, and becau&s;e it nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;ults from the Differences which di&s;tingui&s;h Man from Bea&s;t: The peculiar Wants, Appetites, Fa|culties, and Capacities of Man, being exactly cal|culated, and framed for &s;uch a State, in&s;omuch that without it, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould live in a Condition in any Degree &s;uitable to his Nature. And &s;ince the Bond and Cement of Society is a Submi&s;&s;ion to its Laws, it plainly follows, that this Duty hath an equal Right with any other to be thought a Law of Nature. And, &s;urely that Pre|cept which enjoyns Obedience to Civil Laws, cannot it &s;elf with any Propriety be accounted a Civil Law; it mu&s;t therefore either have no Obli|gation at all on the Con&s;cience, or if it hath, it mu&s;t be derived from the univer&s;al Voice of Na|ture and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. And thus the fir&s;t Point propo&s;ed &s;eems clearly made out. Namely, That Loyalty is a Virtue or Moral Duty; and Di&s;loyalty or Rebelli|on, in the mo&s;t &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e, a Vice or Crime again&s;t the Law of Nature. We are now come to the Second Point, which was to &s;hew, that the Prohibitions of Vice, or negative Precepts of Morality, are to be taken in a mo&s;t ab&s;olute, nece&s;&s;ary, and immutable Sen&s;e; in&s;omuch that the Attainment of the greate&s;t Good, or Delive|rance from the greate&s;t Evil, that can befal any Man or Number of Men in this Life, may not ju|&s;tify the lea&s;t Violation of them. But in the fir&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="25">
place, I &s;hall explain the Rea&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hing between Po&s;itive and Negative Precepts, the lat|ter only being included in this general Propo&s;ition. Now the Ground of that Di&s;tinction may be re|&s;olved into this; namely, that very often, either through the Difficulty or Number of Moral Acti|ons, or their Incon&s;i&s;tence with each other, it is not po&s;&s;ible for one Man to perform &s;everal of them at the &s;ame time; whereas it is plainly con|&s;i&s;tent and po&s;&s;ible, that any Man &s;hou'd, at the &s;ame time, ab&s;tain from all manner of po&s;itive Actions what&s;oever. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that Prohibitions or Negative Precepts mu&s;t by every one, in all Times and Places, be all actually ob&s;er|ved: Whereas tho&s;e which enjoin the Doing of an Action, allow room for Human Prudence and Di&s;cretion, in the Execution of them: it for the mo&s;t part depending on various accidental Circum|&s;tances; all which ought to be con&s;ider'd, and Care taken that Duties of le&s;s Moment do not in|terfere with, and hinder the fulfilling of tho&s;e which are more important. And for this Rea&s;on, if not the Po&s;itive Laws them&s;elves, at lea&s;t the Exerci&s;e of them admits of Su&s;pen&s;ion, Limitati|on, and Diver&s;ity of Degrees. As to the Indi&s;pen|&s;iblene&s;s of the Negative Precepts of the Law of Nature, I &s;hall in its Proof offer Two Arguments, the Fir&s;t from the Nature of the Thing, and the Second from the Imitation of God in his Govern|ment of the World.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Fir&s;t then, from the Nature of the Thing, it hath been already &s;hewn, that the great End of Morality can never be carried on, by leaving each particular Per&s;on to promote the Pub|lick Good, in &s;uch a manner as he &s;hall think mo&s;t convenient, without pre&s;cribing certain determi|nate,
<PB N="23" REF="26">
univer&s;al Rules to be the common Mea&s;ure of Moral Actions; and, if we allow the Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e, and at the &s;ame time think it lawful to tran&s;gre&s;s them, whenever the Publick Good &s;hall &s;eem to require it, what is this, but in Words in|deed to enjoin the Ob&s;ervation of Moral Rules, but in effect to leave every one to be guided by his own Judgment; than which nothing can be ima|gined more pernicious and de&s;tructive to Mankind, as hath been already proved. Secondly, This &s;ame Point may be collected from the Example &s;et us by the Author of Nature, who, as we have above ob&s;erved, acts according to certain fixed Laws, which he will not tran&s;gre&s;s upon the Ac|count of Accidental Evils ari&s;ing from them. Suppo&s;e a Prince, on who&s;e Life the Welfare of a Kingdom depends, to fall down a Precipice, we have no Rea&s;on to think, that the Univer&s;al Law of Gravitation wou'd be &s;u&s;pended in that Ca&s;e. The like may be &s;aid of all other Laws of Nature, which we do not find to admit of Exceptions on particular Accounts.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. And, as without &s;uch a Steddine&s;s in Nature, we &s;hou'd &s;oon, in&s;tead of this beautiful Frame, &s;ee nothing but a di&s;orderly, and confu&s;ed Chaos: So if once it become current, that the Moral Actions of Men are not to be guided by certain definite inviolable Rules, there will be no longer found that Beauty, Order, and Agreement, in the Sy&s;tem of Rational Beings, or Moral World, which will then be all cover'd over with Darkne&s;s and Violence. It is true, he who &s;tands clo&s;e to a Palace, can hardly make a right Judgment of the Architecture and Symmetry of its &s;everal Parts, the nearer ever appearing di&s;proportionably great. And if we have a mind to take a fair Pro&s;pect of
<PB N="24" REF="27">
the Order and general Well-being, which the in|flexible Laws of Nature and Morality derive on the World, we mu&s;t, if I may &s;o &s;ay, go out of it, and imagine our &s;elves to be di&s;tant Spectators of all that is tran&s;acted and contained in it; other|wi&s;e we are &s;ure to be deceived, by the too near View of the little pre&s;ent Intere&s;ts of our Selves, our Friends, or our Country. The right Under|&s;tanding of what hath been &s;aid, will, I think, af|ford a clear Solution to the following Difficulties.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. Fir&s;t, it may perhaps &s;eem to &s;ome, that in Con&s;equence of the foregoing Doctrine, Men will be left to their own private Judgments as much as ever. For, Fir&s;t, the very being of the Laws of Nature; Secondly, the <HI>Criterion</HI> whereby to know them; and, Thirdly, the Agreement of any particular Precept with that <HI>Criterion,</HI> are all to be di&s;covered by Rea&s;on and Argumentation, in which every Man doth nece&s;&s;arily judge for him&s;elf; hence upon that Suppo&s;ition, there is Place for as great Confu&s;ion, Un&s;teddine&s;s, and Contrariety of Opinions and Actions, as upon any other. I an&s;wer, that however Men may dif|fer, as to what were mo&s;t proper and beneficial to the Publick to be done or omitted on particular Occa&s;ions, when they have for the mo&s;t part nar|row and intere&s;ted Views; yet in general Conclu|&s;ions, drawn from an equal and enlarged View of Things, it is not po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be &s;o great, if any Di&s;agreement at all among&s;t Candid, Ra|tional Enquirers after Truth.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Secondly, The mo&s;t plau&s;ible Pretence of all, again&s;t the Doctrine we have premi&s;ed concerning a rigid indi&s;pen&s;ible Ob&s;ervation of Moral Rules, is that which is founded on the Con|&s;ideration
<PB N="25" REF="28">
of the Publick Weal; for &s;ince the com|mon Good of Mankind is confe&s;&s;edly the End which God requires &s;hou'd be promoted by the free Actions of Men, it may &s;eem to follow, that all good Men ought ever to have this in View, as the great Mark to which all their Endeavours &s;hould be directed; if therefore in any particular Ca&s;e, a &s;trict keeping to the Moral Rule &s;hall prove mani|fe&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Publick Good, it may be thought agreeable to the Will of God, that in that Ca&s;e the Rule does not re&s;train an hone&s;t di&s;in|tere&s;ted Per&s;on, from acting for that End to which the Rule it &s;elf was Ordained. For it is an Axiom, that <HI>the End is more Excellent than the Means,</HI> which deriving their Goodne&s;s from the End, may not come in Competition with it.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. In An&s;wer to this, let it be ob&s;erv'd, that nothing is a <HI>Law</HI> merely becau&s;e it conduceth to the Publick Good, but becau&s;e it is decreed by the Will of God, which alone can give the San|ction of a <HI>Law of Nature</HI> to any Precept; neither is any thing, how expedient or plau&s;ible &s;oever, to be e&s;teemed lawful on any other Account, than its being coincident with, or not repugnant to the Laws promulgated by the Voice of Nature and Rea&s;on. It mu&s;t indeed be allowed, that the ra|tional Deduction of tho&s;e Laws is founded in the intrin&s;ick Tendency they have to promote the Well-being of Mankind, on Condition they are univer&s;ally and con&s;tantly ob&s;erved. But tho' it afterwards comes to pa&s;s, that they accidentally fail of that End, or even promote the contrary, they are neverthele&s;s binding, as hath been already proved. In &s;hort, that whole Difficulty may be re&s;olved by the following Di&s;tinction. In framing the general Laws of Nature, it is granted, we mu&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="29">
be entirely guided by the Publick Good of Man|kind, but not in the ordinary Moral Actions of our Lives. Such a Rule, if univer&s;ally ob&s;erv'd, hath from the Nature of Things, a nece&s;&s;ary Fit|ne&s;s to promote the general Well-being of Man|kind; therefore it is a Law of Nature: This is good Rea&s;oning. But if we &s;hou'd &s;ay &s;uch an Action doth in this In&s;tance produce much Good, and no Harm to Mankind; therefore it is lawful: This were wrong. The Rule is framed with re|&s;pect to the Good of Mankind, but our Practice mu&s;t be always &s;haped immediately by the Rule. They who think the Publick Good of a Nation to be the &s;ole Mea&s;ure of the Obedience due to the Civil Power, &s;eem not to have con&s;idered this Di|&s;tinction.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. If it be &s;aid that &s;ome Negative Pre|cepts, <HI>e. g. Thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> do admit of Limita|tion, &s;ince otherwi&s;e it were unlawful for the Ma|gi&s;trate, for a Soldier in a Battel, or a Man in his own Defence to kill another: I an&s;wer, when a Duty is expre&s;&s;ed in too general Terms, as in this In&s;tance, in Order to a di&s;tinct Declaration of it, either tho&s;e Terms may be changed for others of a more limited Sen&s;e, as <HI>Kill</HI> for <HI>Murder,</HI> or el&s;e from the general Propo&s;ition remaining in its full Latitude, Exceptions may be made of tho&s;e preci&s;e Ca&s;es, which not agreeing with the Notion of Murder, are not prohibited by the Law of Nature. In the former Ca&s;e there is a Limitation, but it is only of the Signification of a &s;ingle Term too ge|neral and improper, by &s;ub&s;tituting another more proper and particular in its Place. In the latter Ca&s;e there are Exceptions, but then they are not from the Law of Nature, but from a more general Propo&s;ition, which be&s;ides that Law, includes &s;ome|what
<PB N="27" REF="30">
more, which mu&s;t be taken away in order to eave the Law by it &s;elf clear and determinate. From neither of which Conce&s;&s;ions will it follow, that any Negative Law of Nature is limited to tho&s;e Ca&s;es only where its particular Application promotes the Publick Good, or admits all other Ca&s;es to be excepted from it, wherein its being actually ob&s;erved produceth Harm to the Publick. But of this I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay more in the Sequel. I have now done with the fir&s;t Head, which was to &s;hew, that there is an Ab&s;olute, Un|limited Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience due to the Supreme Power, where-ever placed in any Nation; and come to enquire into the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of the contrary Opinion; which was the Second Thing propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. One great Principle, which the Plead|ers for Re&s;i&s;tance make the Ground-Work of their Doctrine, is, that the Law of Self-Pre&s;ervation is <HI>Prior</HI> to all other Engagement, being the very fir&s;t and fundamental Law of Nature. Hence, &s;ay they, Subjects are obliged by Nature, and it is their Duty, to re&s;i&s;t the cruel Attempts of Tyrants, however authorized by unju&s;t and Bloody Laws, which are nothing el&s;e but the Decrees of Men, and con&s;equently mu&s;t give way to tho&s;e of God, or Nature. But, perhaps, if we narrowly examine this Notion, it will not be found &s;o ju&s;t and clear as &s;ome Men may imagine, or, indeed, as at fir&s;t Sight it &s;eems to be. For we ought to di&s;tingui&s;h between a Two-fold Signification of the Terms <HI>Law of Nature</HI>; which Words do either denote ae Rule or Precept for the Direction of the voluntary Actions of rea&s;onable Agents, and in that Sen&s;e they imply a Duty; or el&s;e they are u&s;ed to &s;ignify any general Rule, which we ob&s;erve to obtain in
<PB N="28" REF="31">
the Works of Nature, independent of the Wills of Men; in which Sen&s;e no Duty is implied. And in this la&s;t Acceptation, I grant it is a general Law of Nature, that in every Animal there be implan|ted a De&s;ire of Self-Pre&s;ervation, which, tho' it is the earlie&s;t, the deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t la&s;ting of all, whether Natural or Acquired Appetites, yet can|not with any Propriety be termed a Moral Duty. But if in the former Sen&s;e of the Words, they mean that Self-Pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t fundamental Law of Nature, which therefore mu&s;t take place of all other Natural or Moral Duties: I think that A&s;&s;ertion to be manife&s;tly fal&s;e, for this plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it wou'd thence follow, a Man may lawfully commit any Sin what&s;oever to pre&s;erve his Life, than which nothing can be more ab&s;urd.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. It cannot indeed be denied, that the Law of Nature re&s;trains us from doing tho&s;e Things which may injure the Life of any Man, and con&s;equently our own. But, notwith&s;tanding all that is &s;aid of the Obligativene&s;s and Priority of the Law of Self-Pre&s;ervation, yet, for ought I can &s;ee, there is no particular Law, which oblige; any Man to prefer his own Temporal Good, not even Life it &s;elf, to that of another Man, much le&s;s to the Ob&s;ervation of any one Moral Duty. This is what we are too ready to perform of our own Accord; and there is more Need of a Law to curb and re&s;train, than there is of one to excite and inflame our Self-Love.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. But, Secondly, tho' we &s;hou'd grant the Duty of Self-Pre&s;ervation to be the fir&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of all the Po&s;itive or Affirmative Laws of Nature; yet, fora&s;much as it is a Maxim
<PB N="29" REF="32">
allowed by all Morali&s;ts, that <HI>Evil is never to be committed, to the end Good may come of it,</HI> it will thence plainly follow, that no Negative Precept ought to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed for the &s;ake of ob&s;erving a Po&s;itive one; and therefore, &s;ince we have &s;hewn, <HI>Thou &s;halt not re&s;i&s;t the Supreme Power,</HI> to be a Nega|tive Law of Nature, it is a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, that it may not be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed under pretence of fulfilling the Po&s;itive Duty of Self-Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. A &s;econd erroneous Ground of our Adver&s;aries, whereon they lay a main Stre&s;s, is that they hold the Publick Good of a particular Nation to be the Mea&s;ure of the Obedience due from the Subject to the Civil Power, which there|fore may be re&s;i&s;ted when&s;oever the Publick Good &s;hall verily &s;eem to require it. But this Point hath been already con&s;ider'd, and in Truth it can give &s;mall Difficulty to whoever under&s;tands Loyalty to be on the &s;ame Foot with other Moral Duties en|joyned in negative Precepts, all which tho' equally calculated to promote the general Well-being, may not neverthele&s;s be limited or &s;u&s;pended un|der pretext of giving way to the end, as is plain from what hath been premi&s;ed on that Subject.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. A Third Rea&s;on which they in&s;i&s;t on, is to this Effect. All Civil Authority or Right is derived originally from the People; but no Body can transfer that to another, which he hath not him&s;elf; therefore &s;ince no Man hath an ab&s;olute unlimited Right over his own Life, the Subject cannot transfer &s;uch a Right to the Prince (or Su|preme Power) who con&s;equently hath no &s;uch un|limited Right to di&s;po&s;e of the Lives of his Sub|jects. In ca&s;e therefore a Subject re&s;i&s;t his Prince, who acting according to Law, maketh an unju&s;t,
<PB N="30" REF="33">
tho' legal, Attempt on his Life, he does him no Wrong, &s;ince Wrong it is not, to prevent another from &s;eizing what he hath no Right to; whence it &s;hou'd &s;eem to follow, that agreeably to Rea&s;on, the Prince or Supreme Power where&s;oever placed may be re&s;i&s;ted. Having thus endeavoured to &s;tate their Argument in its cleare&s;t Light, I make this An&s;wer. Fir&s;t, it is granted, no Civil Power hath an unlimited Right to di&s;po&s;e of the Life of any Man. Secondly, in ca&s;e one Man re&s;i&s;t another invading that which he hath no Right to, it is granted he doth him no Wrong. But in the Third Place, I deny that it doth thence follow, the Su|preme Power may con&s;onantly to Rea&s;on be re|&s;i&s;ted, becau&s;e that altho' &s;uch Re&s;i&s;tance wronged not the Prince or Supreme Power where&s;oever placed, yet it were injurious to the Author of Na|ture, and a Violation of his Law, which Rea&s;on obligeth us to Tran&s;gre&s;s upon no Account what|&s;oever, as hath been demon&s;trated.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. A Fourth Mi&s;take or Prejudice which influenceth the Impugners of Non-Re&s;i|&s;tance, ari&s;es from the natural Dread of Slavery, Chains, and Fetters which in&s;pires them with an Aver&s;ion for any thing, which even metaphorical|ly comes under tho&s;e Denominations. Hence they cry out again&s;t us that we wou'd deprive them of their natural Freedom, that we are making Chains for Mankind, that we are for en&s;laving them, and the like. But how har&s;h &s;oever the Sentence may appear, yet it is mo&s;t true, that our Appetites, even the mo&s;t natural, as of Ea&s;e, Plenty, or Life it &s;elf, mu&s;t be chain'd and fetter'd by the Laws of Nature and Rea&s;on. This Slavery, if they will call it &s;o, or Subjection of our Pa&s;&s;ions to the im|mutable Decrees of Rea&s;on, though it may be
<PB N="31" REF="34">
Galling to the &s;en&s;ual Part or the Bea&s;t, yet &s;ure I am, it addeth much to the Dignity of that which is peculiarly Human in our Compo&s;ition. This leads me to the Fifth fundamental Error:</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. Namely, the mi&s;taking the Object of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience. We &s;hou'd con&s;ider, that when a Subject endures the In&s;olence and Oppre&s;&s;ion of one or more Magi&s;trates, armed with the Supreme Civil Power, the Object of his Submi&s;&s;ion is, in &s;trict Truth, nothing el&s;e but right Rea&s;on, which is the Voice of the Author of Nature. Think not we are &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s, as to imagine Ty|rants ca&s;t in a better Mould than other Men: No, they are the wor&s;t and vile&s;t of Men, and for their own Sakes, have not the lea&s;t Right to our Obe|dience. But the Laws of God and Nature mu&s;t be obey'd, and our Obedience to them is never more acceptable and &s;incere, than when it expo|&s;eth us to Temporal Calamities.</P>
<P N="40">XL. A Sixth fal&s;e Ground of Per&s;ua&s;ion to tho&s;e we argue again&s;t, is their not di&s;tingui&s;hing be|tween the Natures of Po&s;itive and Negative Du|ties. For, &s;ay they, &s;ince our active Obedience to the Supreme Civil Power is acknowledged to be limited, why may not our Duty of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance be thought &s;o too? The An&s;wer is plain; becau&s;e Po&s;itive and Negative Moral Precepts are not of the &s;ame Nature, the former admitting &s;uch Limitati|ons and Exceptions as the latter are on no Account liable to, as hath been already proved. It is very po&s;&s;ible that a Man in obeying the Commands of his lawful Governors, might tran&s;gre&s;s &s;ome Law of God contrary to them; which it is not po&s;&s;ible for him to do, meerly by a patient Suffering and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance for Con&s;cience &s;ake. And this
<PB N="32" REF="35">
furni&s;hes &s;uch a Satisfactory and obvious Solution of the forementioned Difficulty, that I am not a little &s;urprized to &s;ee it in&s;i&s;ted on, by Men, other|wi&s;e, of good Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on. And &s;o much for the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of the Adver&s;aries of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance. I now proceed to the third and la&s;t Thing propo&s;ed, Namely, the Con&s;ideration of the Objections drawn from the pretended Con|&s;equences of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. Fir&s;t then it will be objected, that in Con|&s;equence of that Notion, we mu&s;t believe that God hath, in &s;everal In&s;tances, laid the innocent Part of Mankind under an unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity of enduring the greate&s;t Sufferings and Hard&s;hips without any Remedy; which is plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, and there|fore the Principle from whence that Con&s;equence flows, ought not to be admitted as a Law of God of Nature. In An&s;wer to which I ob&s;erve, we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the nece&s;&s;ary and accidental Con&s;equences of a Moral Law. The former Kind are tho&s;e which the Law is in its own Nature calculated to produce, and which have an in&s;eparable Connexion with the Ob&s;ervation of it; and indeed if the&s;e are bad, we may ju&s;tly conclude the Law to be &s;o too, and con&s;equently not from God. But the accidental Con&s;equences of a Law, have no intrin&s;ic natural Connexion with, nor do they &s;trictly &s;peaking flow from its Ob&s;ervation, but are the genuine Re&s;ult of &s;ome|thing foreign and circum&s;tantial, which happens to be joyned with it. And the&s;e accidental Con&s;e|quences of a very good Law, may neverthele&s;s be very bad; which Badne&s;s of theirs is to be char|ged on their own proper and nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;e, and not on the Law, which hath no E&s;&s;ential Tenden|cy
<PB N="33" REF="36">
to produce them. Now though it mu&s;t be granted, that a Lawgiver infinitely wi&s;e and good will con&s;titute &s;uch Laws for the Regulation of human Actions, as have in their own Nature a ne|ce&s;&s;ary inherent Aptne&s;s to promote the common Good of all Mankind, and that in the greate&s;t De|gree that the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances and Capacities of human Nature will admit; yet we deny that the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the Lawgiver are concerned, or may be called in Que&s;tion, on Ac|count of the particular Evils which ari&s;e, nece&s;&s;a|rily and properly, from the <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;ome one or more good Laws, and but accidentally from the <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> of others. But it is plain that the &s;everal Calamities and Deva&s;tations, which oppre&s;|&s;ive Governments bring on the World, are not the genuine nece&s;&s;ary Effects of the Law, that enjoin|eth a Pa&s;&s;ive Subjection to the Supreme Power, neither are they included in the primary Intention thereof, but &s;pring from Avarice, Ambition, Cru|elty, Revenge, and the like inordinate Affections and Vices raging in the Brea&s;ts of Governors. They may not therefore argue a defect of Wi&s;dom or Goodne&s;s in God's Law, but of Righteou&s;ne&s;s in Men.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. Such is the pre&s;ent State of Things, &s;o irregular are the Wills, and &s;o unre&s;trained the Pa&s;|&s;ions of Men, that we every Day &s;ee manife&s;t Breaches and Violations of the Laws of Nature, which being always committed in Favour of the Wicked, mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;ometimes attended with heavy Di&s;advantages and Mi&s;eries, on the Part of tho&s;e who by a firm Adhe&s;ion to his Laws endea|vour to approve them&s;elves in the Eyes of their Creator. There are in &s;hort, no Rules of Mora|lity, not excepting the be&s;t, but what may &s;ubject
<PB N="34" REF="37">
good Men to great Sufferings and Hard&s;hips, which nece&s;&s;arily follows from the Wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e they have to deal with, and but accidentally from tho&s;e good Rules. And as on the one Hand it were incon&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom of God, by &s;uffering a retaliation of Fraud, Perjury, or the like on the Head of Offenders, to puni&s;h one Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion by another: So on the other Hand, it were incon&s;i&s;tent with his Ju&s;tice, to leave the Good and Innocent a hopele&s;s Sacrifice to the Wicked. God therefore hath appointed a Day of Retribution in another Life, and in this we have his Grace and a good Con&s;cience for our Support. We &s;hou'd not therefore repine at the Divine Laws, or &s;hew a frowardne&s;s or impatience of tho&s;e tran&s;ient Sufferings they accidentally expo&s;e us to, which however grating to Fle&s;h and Blood, will yet &s;eem of &s;mall moment, if we compare the littlene&s;s and fleetingne&s;s of this pre&s;ent World with the Glory and Eternity of the next.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. From what hath been &s;aid I think it is plain, that the premi&s;ed Doctrine of Non-Re&s;i|&s;tance were &s;afe, tho' the Evils incurred thereby &s;hou'd be allowed never &s;o great. But perhaps upon a &s;trict examination, they will be found much le&s;s than by many they are thought to be. The mi&s;chievous effects which are charged on that Doctrine may be reduced to the&s;e two Points. Fir&s;t, that it is an encouragement for all Gover|nors to become Tyrants, by the pro&s;pect it gives them of Impunity or Non-Re&s;i&s;tance. Secondly, that it renders the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty of tho&s;e who are Tyrants, more in&s;upportable and violent, by cutting off all Oppo&s;ition, and con&s;equently all means of Redre&s;s. I &s;hall con&s;ider each of the&s;e di&s;tinctly. As to the fir&s;t Point, either you'll &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="38">
the Governors to be good or ill Men. If they are Good, there is no fear of their becoming Ty|rants. And if they are ill Men, that is, &s;uch as po&s;tpone the Ob&s;ervation of God's Laws to the &s;atisfying of their own Lu&s;ts, then it can be no Security to them, that others will rigidly ob&s;erve tho&s;e Moral Precepts, which they find them&s;elves &s;o prone to Tran&s;gre&s;s.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. It is indeed a Breach of the Law of Na|ture for a Subject, tho' under the greate&s;t and mo&s;t unju&s;t Sufferings, to lift up his Hand again&s;t the Supreme Power. But it is a more heinous and in|excu&s;able Violation of it, for the Per&s;ons inve&s;ted with the Supreme Power, to u&s;e that Power to the Ruin and De&s;truction of the People commit|ted to their Charge. What encouragement there|fore can any Man have, to think that others will not be pu&s;h'd on by the &s;trong implanted Appe|tite of Self-Pre&s;ervation, to commit a Crime, when he him&s;elf commits a more bruti&s;h and un|natural Crime, perhaps without any provocation at all? Or is it to be imagined that they who daily break God's Laws, for the &s;ake of &s;ome little Profit or tran&s;ient Plea&s;ure, will not be tempted by the love of Property, Liberty, or Life it &s;elf, to Tran&s;gre&s;s that &s;ingle Precept which forbids Re|&s;i&s;tance to the Supreme Power?</P>
<P N="45">XLV. But it will be demanded, to what pur|po&s;e then is this Duty of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance Preached and Proved, and Recommended to our Practice, if in all likelihood, when things come to an ex|tremity, Men will never ob&s;erve it? I An&s;wer, to the very &s;ame purpo&s;e that any other Duty is Preached. For what Duty is there which many, too many, upon &s;ome con&s;ideration or other may
<PB N="36" REF="39">
not be prevail'd on to Tran&s;gre&s;s? Morali&s;ts and Divines do not Preach the Duties of Nature and Religion, with the View of Gaining Mankind to a perfect Ob&s;ervation of them; that they know is not to be done. But, however, our Pains are An|&s;wered, if we can make Men le&s;s Sinners than otherwi&s;e they wou'd be; if by oppo&s;ing the force of Duty to that of pre&s;ent Intere&s;t and Pa&s;&s;ion, we can get the better of &s;ome Temptations, and Balance others, while the greate&s;t &s;till remain In|vincible.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. But granting tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with the Supreme Power to have all imaginable Security, that no cruel and barbarous Treatment whatever cou'd provoke their Subjects to Rebel|lion: Yet I believe it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether &s;uch Security would tempt them to more or greater Acts of Cruelty, than Jealou&s;ie, Di|&s;tru&s;t, Su&s;picion and Revenge may do in a State le&s;s Secure. And &s;o far in con&s;ideration of the fir&s;t Point, Namely, that the Doctrine of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance is an encouragement for Governors to become Tyrants.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. The &s;econd Mi&s;chievous Effect it was Charged with, is, that it renders the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty of tho&s;e who are Tyrants more in|&s;upportable and violent, by cutting off all Oppo|&s;ition, and con&s;equently all means of Redre&s;s. But, if things are rightly con&s;ider'd, it will appear, that Redre&s;&s;ing the Evils of Government by Force, is at be&s;t, a very hazardous Attempt, and what often puts the Publick in a wor&s;e State than it was before. For either you &s;uppo&s;e the Power of the Rebels to be but &s;mall, and ea&s;ily Cru&s;hed, and then this is apt to in&s;pire the Governors with Con|fidence
<PB N="37" REF="40">
and Cruelty. Or, in ca&s;e you &s;uppo&s;e it more con&s;iderable, &s;o as to be a Match for the Su|preme Power &s;upported by the Publick Trea&s;ure, Forts and Armies, and that the whole Nation is engaged in a Civil War; the certain effects of this are Rapine, Blood&s;hed, Mi&s;ery, and Confu&s;ion to all Orders and Parties of Men, greater and more in&s;upportable by far, than are known under any the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and &s;evere Tyranny upon Earth. And it may be that after much mutual Slaughter, the Rebellious Party will prevail. And if they do prevail to De&s;troy the Government in Being, it may be they will Sub&s;titute a better in its Place, or change it into better Hands. And may not this come to pa&s;s without the expence, and toil, and blood of War? Is not the Heart of a Prince in the Hand of God? May he not therefore give him a right Sen&s;e of his Duty, or may he not call him out of the World by Sickne&s;s, Accident, or the Hand of &s;ome de&s;perate Ruffian, and &s;end a better in his Stead. When I &s;peak as of a Monarchy, I would be under&s;tood to mean all &s;orts of Govern|ment, where&s;oever the Supreme Power is Lodged. Upon the whole, I think we may clo&s;e with the Heathen Philo&s;opher, who thought it the part of a Wi&s;e Man, never to attempt the Change of Go|vernment by Force, when it cou'd not be mended without the Slaughter and Bani&s;hment of his Countrymen: But to Sit &s;till, and Pray for bet|ter Times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plato <HI>in Epi&s;t</HI> 7.</NOTE>. For this way may do, and the other may not do; there is uncertainty in both Cour&s;es. The difference is, that in the way of Rebellion, we are &s;ure to increa&s;e the Publick Calamities, for a time at lea&s;t, tho' we are not &s;ure of le&s;&s;ening them for the future.</P>
<P N="48"><PB N="38" REF="41">
XLVIII. But tho' it &s;hould be acknowledged, that in the main, Submi&s;&s;ion and Patience ought to be recommended; yet, Men will be &s;till apt to demand, whether extraordinary Ca&s;es may not require extraordinary Mea&s;ures; and therefore in ca&s;e the Oppre&s;&s;ion be in&s;upportable, and the Pro|&s;pect of Deliverance &s;ure, whether Rebellion may not be allowed of? I An&s;wer, By no means. Per|jury, or Breach of Faith, may, in &s;ome po&s;&s;ible Ca&s;es, bring great Advantage to a Nation, by free|ing it from Conditions incon&s;i&s;tent with its Liber|ty and Publick Welfare. So likewi&s;e, may Adul|tery, by procuring a Dome&s;tick Heir, prevent a Kingdom's falling into the Hands of a Foreign Power, which wou'd in all probability prove its Ruin. Yet will any Man &s;ay, the extraordinary Nature of tho&s;e Ca&s;es can take away the Guilt of Perjury and Adultery? This is what I will not &s;uppo&s;e. But it hath been &s;hewn, that Rebellion is as truly a Crime again&s;t Nature and Rea&s;on as either of the foregoing, it may not therefore be Ju&s;tified upon any Account whatever, any more than they.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. What! Mu&s;t we then Submit our Necks to the Sword? And is there no Help, no Refuge again&s;t extream Tyranny e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law? In An&s;wer to this, I &s;ay in the fir&s;t place, it is not to be feared that Men in their Wits &s;hou'd &s;eek the De&s;truction of their People, by &s;uch cruel and un|natural Decrees as &s;ome are forward to &s;uppo&s;e. I &s;ay, Secondly, that in ca&s;e they &s;hou'd, yet mo&s;t certainly the Subordinate Magi&s;trates may not, nay, they ought not, in Obedience to tho&s;e De|crees to act any thing contrary to the expre&s;s Laws of God. And perhaps all things con&s;idered, it
<PB N="39" REF="42">
will be thought, that repre&s;enting this Limitation of their active Obedience by the Laws of God or Nature, as a Duty to the Mini&s;ters of the Supreme Power, may prove in tho&s;e extravagant &s;uppo&s;ed Ca&s;es no le&s;s effectual for the Peace and Safety of a Nation, than Preaching up the Power of Re&s;i|&s;tance to the People.</P>
<P N="50">L. Further, It will probably be Objected as an Ab&s;urdity in the Doctrine of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, that it enjoyneth Subjects a blind implicit Submi&s;|&s;ion to the Decrees of other Men; which is un|becoming the Dignity and Freedom of rea&s;onable Agents; who indeed ought to pay Obedience to their Superiors, but it &s;hou'd be a rational Obedi|ence, &s;uch as ari&s;es from a knowledge of the Equi|ty of their Laws, and the Tendency they have to promote the Public Good. To which I An&s;wer, That it is not likely a Government &s;hou'd &s;uffer much for want of having its Laws in&s;pected and amended, by tho&s;e who are not legally intitled to a &s;hare in the management of Affairs of that Na|ture. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the Bulk of Man|kind are by their Circum&s;tances and Occupations, &s;o far unqualified to judge of &s;uch Matters, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pay an implicit deference to &s;ome or other, and to whom &s;o properly as to tho&s;e inve&s;ted with the Supreme Power?</P>
<P N="51">LI. There is another Objection again&s;t ab&s;o|lute Submi&s;&s;ion, which I &s;hou'd not have mentio|ned, but that I find it in&s;i&s;ted on by Men of &s;o great Note, as <HI>Grotius</HI> and <HI>Pufendorf</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grotius de jure Belli &amp; Pacis, l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 4. <HI>&s;.</HI> 7. <HI>&amp; Pufendorf de jure naturae &amp; gentium, l</HI> 7 <HI>c.</HI> 8. <HI>&s;.</HI> 7.</NOTE>, who think our Non-Re&s;i&s;tance &s;hou'd be mea&s;ured by the in|tention
<PB N="40" REF="43">
of tho&s;e who fir&s;t framed the Society. Now, &s;ay they, if we &s;uppo&s;e the que&s;tion put to them, Whether they meant to lay every Subject under a Nece&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing Death, rather than in any Ca&s;e to Re&s;i&s;t the Cruelty of his Superiors, it cannot be imagined, they wou'd An&s;wer in the Affirmative. For this were to put them&s;elves in a wor&s;e Condition, than that which they endea|voured to avoid by entring into Society. For al|tho' they were obnoxious to the Injuries of many, they had neverthele&s;s the Power of Re&s;i&s;ting them. But now they are bound, without any Oppo&s;ition at all, to endure the greate&s;t Injuries from tho&s;e whom they have Armed with their own Strength. Which is by &s;o much wor&s;e than the former State, as the undergoing an Execution is wor&s;e than the hazard of a Battle. But (pa&s;&s;ing by all other Ex|ceptions which this Method of arguing may be li|able to) it is evident, that a Man had better be ex|po&s;ed to the ab&s;olute irre&s;i&s;tible Decrees, even of one &s;ingle Per&s;on, who&s;e own and Po&s;terities true Intere&s;t it is to pre&s;erve him in Peace and Plenty, and Protect him from the Injuries of all Mankind be&s;ide, than remain an open Prey to the Rage and Avarice of every Wicked Man upon Earth, who either exceeds him in Strength, or takes him at an Advantage. The Truth of this is confirmed, as well by the con&s;tant Experience of the far greater Part of the World, as by what we have already ob&s;erv'd concerning Anarchy, and the Incon&s;i|&s;tence of &s;uch a State, with that manner of Life which Human Nature requires. Hence it is plain, the Objection la&s;t mentioned is Built on a fal&s;e Suppo&s;ition; <HI>Viz.</HI> That Men, by quitting the Na|tural State of Anarchy for that of ab&s;olute Non-Re&s;i&s;ting Obedience to Government, wou'd put them&s;elves in a wor&s;e Condition than they were in before.</P>
<P N="52"><PB N="41" REF="44">
LII. The la&s;t Objection I &s;hall take Notice of is, that in pur&s;uance of the premi&s;ed Doctrine, where no Exceptions, no Limitations are to be al|lowed of, it &s;hou'd &s;eem to follow, Men were bound to &s;ubmit without making any Oppo&s;ition to U&s;urpers, or even Madmen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Su|preme Authority. Which is a Notion &s;o ab&s;urd and repugnant to common Sen&s;e, that the Founda|tion on which it is Built, may ju&s;tly be called in Que&s;tion. Now, in order to clear this Point, I ob&s;erve the Limitation of Moral Duties may be under&s;tood in a Twofold Sen&s;e, either fir&s;t as a Di&s;tinction applied to the Terms of a Propo&s;ition, whereby that which was expre&s;&s;ed before too ge|nerally is limited to a particular Acceptation; and this, in truth, is not &s;o properly limiting the Du|ty as defining it. Or, Secondly, it may be under|&s;tood as a Su&s;pending the Ob&s;ervation of a Duty for avoiding &s;ome extraordinary Inconvenience, and thereby confining it to certain Occa&s;ions. And in this la&s;t Sen&s;e only, We have &s;hewn Ne|gative Duties not to admit of Limitation. Name|ly, that by Vertue of the Duty of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> We are not obliged to Submit the Di&s;po&s;al of our Lives and Fortunes to the Di&s;cretion either of Mad|men, or of all tho&s;e who by Craft or Violence in|vade the Supreme Power. Becau&s;e the Object of the Submi&s;&s;ion enjoyned Subjects by the Law of Nature is, from the Rea&s;on of the thing, Mani|fe&s;tly limited &s;o as to exclude both the one and the other. Which I &s;hall not go about to prove, be|cau&s;e I believe no Body has denied it. Nor doth the Annexing &s;uch Limits to the Object of our Obedience, at all limit the Duty it &s;elf, in the Sen&s;e we except again&s;t.</P>
<P N="53"><PB N="42" REF="45">
LIII. In the Various Changes and Fluctuations of Government, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent that Controver&s;ies &s;hou'd &s;ometimes ari&s;e concerning the Seat of the Supreme Power. And in &s;uch Ca|&s;es Subjects cannot be Denied the Liberty of Judg|ing for Them&s;elves, or of taking part with &s;ome, and oppo&s;ing others, according to the be&s;t of their Judgments; all which is Con&s;i&s;tent with an exact Ob&s;ervation of their Duty, &s;o long as, when the Con&s;titution is clear in the Point, and the Object of their Submi&s;&s;ion undoubted, no Pretext of In|tere&s;t, Friends, or the Publick Good, can make them depart from it. In &s;hort, it is acknowledged, that the Precept enjoyning Non-Re&s;i&s;tance is Li|mited to particular Objects, but not to particular Occa&s;ions. And in this it is like all other Moral Negative Duties, which con&s;ider'd as general Pro|po&s;itions, do admit of Limitations and Re&s;tricti|ons, in order to a di&s;tinct Definition of the Duty; but what is once known to be a Duty of that &s;ort, can never become otherwi&s;e by any good or ill Effect, Circum&s;tance, or Event what&s;oever. And in Truth if it were not &s;o, if there were no Ge|neral Inflexible Rules, but all Negative as well as Po&s;itive Duties might be Di&s;pen&s;ed with, and Warpt to Serve particular Intere&s;ts and Occa&s;ions, there were an end of all Morality.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. It is therefore Evident, that as the Ob&s;er|vation of any other Negative Moral Law, is not to be limited to tho&s;e In&s;tances only, where it may produce good Effects; &s;o neither is the Ob&s;erva|tion of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance limited in &s;uch &s;ort, as that any Man may Lawfully Tran&s;gre&s;s it, when&s;oever in his Judgment, the Publick Good of his Particu|lar Country &s;hall require it. And it is with Re|gard
<PB N="43" REF="46">
to this Limitation by the Effects, that I &s;peak of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, as an ab&s;olute, unconditioned, unlimited Duty. Which mu&s;t inevitably be grant|ed, unle&s;s one of the&s;e three Things can be prov'd: Either, Fir&s;t, that <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> is no Moral Duty. Or, Secondly, that other Negative Moral Duties are limited by the Effects. Or, La&s;tly, that there is &s;omething peculiar in the Nature of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjects it to &s;uch a Limitation, as no other Negative Moral Duty can admit. The contrary to each of which Points, if I mi&s;take not, hath been clearly made out.</P>
<P N="55">LV. I have now briefly gone through the Ob|jections drawn from the Con&s;equences of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, which was the la&s;t General Head I propo&s;ed to Treat of. In handling this and the other Points, I have endeavour'd to be as full and clear, as the u&s;ual length of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es would permit, and throughout to con&s;ider the Argument with the &s;ame Indifference, as I &s;hou'd any other part of General Knowledge, being verily per&s;wa|ded that Men, as Chri&s;tians, are obliged to the Practice of no one Moral Duty, which may not abide the &s;evere&s;t Te&s;t of Rea&s;on.</P>
