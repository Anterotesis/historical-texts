<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I con|fe&s;s
I was &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the poets
of the la&s;t age, and &s;trove to imitate them. The
term, genteel comedy, was then unknown among&s;t
us, and little more was de&s;ired by an audience, than
nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they
were mo&s;t con&s;picuous. The author of the follow|ing
&s;cenes never imagined that more would be ex|pected
of him, and therefore to delineate character
has been his principal aim. Tho&s;e who know any
thing of compo&s;ition, are &s;en&s;ible, that in pur&s;uing
humour, it will &s;ometimes lead us into the rece&s;&s;es
of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in
the ma&s;ter of a &s;punging-hou&s;e: but in deference to
the public ta&s;te, grown of late, perhaps, too deli|cate,
the &s;cene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the
repre&s;entation. In deference al&s;o to the judgment
of a few friends, who think in a particular way, the
&s;cene is here re&s;tored. The author &s;ubmits it to the
<PB REF="6">
reader in his clo&s;et; and hopes that too much refine|ment
will not bani&s;h humour and character from
ours, as it has already done from the French theatre.
Indeed the French comedy is now become &s;o very
elevated and &s;entimental, that it has not only ba|ni&s;hed
humour and Moliere from the &s;tage, but it
has bani&s;hed all &s;pectators too.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to
the public for the favourable reception which the
Good-Natur'd Man has met with: and to Mr. Col|man
in particular, for his kindne&s;s to it. It may
not al&s;o be improper to a&s;&s;ure any, who &s;hall here|after
write for the theatre, that merit, or &s;uppo&s;ed.
merit, will ever be a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port to his
protection.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE, an apartment in Young HONEYWOOD'S

<STAGE>Enter Sir WILLIAM HONEYWOOD, JARVIS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Jarvis, make no apologies for this ho|ne&s;t
bluntne&s;s. Fidelity, like yours, is the be&s;t ex|cu&s;e
for every freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help being blunt, and being very angry
too, when I hear you talk of di&s;inheriting &s;o good,
&s;o worthy a young gentleman as your nephew, my
ma&s;ter. All the world loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather, that he loves all the world; that is
his fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm &s;ure there is no part of it more dear to him
than you are, though he has not &s;een you &s;ince he
was a child,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ignifies his affection to me; or how can I
be proud of a place in a heart where every &s;harper
and coxcomb find an ea&s;y entrance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you that he is rather too good-natur'd;
that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs
this minute with one, and cries the next with ano|ther:
but who&s;e in&s;tructions may he thank for all
this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not mine, &s;ure? My letters to him during my
employment in Italy, taught him only that philo&s;o|phy
which might prevent, not defend his errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm &s;orry
they taught him any philo&s;ophy at all; it has only
&s;erv'd to &s;poil him. This &s;ame philo&s;ophy is a good
hor&s;e in the &s;table, but an arrant jade on a journey.
For my own part, whenever I hear him mention the
name on't, I'm always &s;ure he's going to play the
fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let us a&s;cribe his faults to his philo&s;ophy,
I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature ari&s;es
rather from his fears of offending the importunate,
than his de&s;ire of making the de&s;erving happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What it ri&s;es from, I don't know. But, to be
&s;ure, every body has it, that a&s;ks it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or that does not a&s;k it. I have been now for
&s;ome time a concealed &s;pectator of his follies, and
find them as boundle&s;s as his di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, faith, he has &s;ome fine name or other
For them all. He calls his extravagance, genero&s;ity;
and his tru&s;ting every body, univer&s;al benevolence.
It was but la&s;t week he went &s;ecurity for a fellow
who&s;e face he &s;carce knew, and that he called an
act of exalted mu&mdash;mu&mdash;munificence; ay, that was
the name he gave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon that I proceed, as my la&s;t effort, though
with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very
fellow has ju&s;t ab&s;conded, and I have, taken up the
&s;ecurity. Now, my intention is to involve him in
fictitious di&s;tre&s;s, before he has plunged him&s;elf into
real calamity. To arre&s;t him for that very debt,
to clap an officer upon him, and then let him &s;ee
which of his friends will come to his relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I could but any way &s;ee him thoroughly
vexed, every groan of his would be mu&s;ic to me;
yet faith, I believe it impo&s;&s;ible. I have tried to
fret him my&s;elf every morning the&s;e three years;
but, in&s;tead of being angry, he &s;its as calmly to
hear me &s;cold, as he does to his hair-dre&s;&s;er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t try him once more, however, and I'll
go this in&s;tant to put my &s;cheme into execution; and
I don't de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding, as, by your means, I
can have frequent opportunities of being about him,
without being known. What a pity it is, Jarvis,
that any man's good-will to others &s;hould produce
&s;o much neglect of him&s;elf, as to require correction?
Yet, we mu&s;t touch his weakne&s;&s;es with a delicate
hand. There are &s;ome faults &s;o nearly allied to ex|cellence,
that we can &s;carce weed out the vice with|out
eradicating the virtue.</P>

<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go thy ways, Sir William Honeywood. It
is not without rea&s;on that the world allows thee to
be the be&s;t of men. But here comes his hopeful
nephew; the &s;trange, good-natur'd, fool&s;h, open|hearted&mdash;And
yet, all his faults are &s;uch that one
loves him &s;till the better for them.</P>

<P>May be not. Indeed what &s;ignifies whom they

<P>May be not. Indeed what &s;ignifies whether they

<P>Ah, Mr. Honeywood, a little of your fine &s;erious

has a very exalted opinion of your under&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, you know but little of my autho|rity
at home. People think, indeed, becau&s;e they
&s;ee me come out in a morning thus, with a plea&s;ant
face, and to make my friends merry, that all's well
within. But I have cares that would break an heart
of &s;tone. My wife has &s;o encroached upon every

mere lodger in my own hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="21">
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a little &s;pirit exerted on your &s;ide might per|haps

<P>No, though I had the &s;pirit of a lion! I do rouze

his wife is tired of lo&s;ing the victory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a melancholy con&s;ideration indeed, that our

<P>Ah, my dear friend, the&s;e were the very words of
poor Dick Doleful to me not a week before he made,

<P>My daughter, Olivia, privately contracted to a

My heart never foretold me of this. And yet, how

<P>Then why &s;hould we defer our &s;cheme of humble

<P>I have many rea&s;ons to believe it will. As his

I have &s;ounded him already at a di&s;tance, and
find all his an&s;wers exactly to our wi&s;h. Nay, by

induced to think he knows of this affair.</P>

Right, gentlemen, very right, upon my word, and

To cen&s;ure it, after what you have done, would
look like malice; and, to &s;peak favourably of a

We have indeed been long acquainted, Sir; very

were plea&s;ed to rally me upon my complexion
there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, madam: I pre&s;umed to reprove you

the company, that the colouring was all from
nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you only meant it, in your good-natured
way, to make me pay a compliment to my&s;elf. In
the &s;ame manner you danced that night with the

nobody el&s;e would take her out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes; and was rewarded the next night, by danc|ing

We generally &s;hew to mo&s;t advantage at

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, madam, did indeed deceive
me. I expected to find a woman with all the faults
of con&s;cious flattered beauty. I expected to find, her
vain and in&s;olent. But every day has &s;ince taught
me that it is po&s;&s;ible to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;e without pride,
and beauty without affectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is a &s;tyle very unu&s;ual with Mr. Ho|neywood;

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;k pardon, madam. Yet, from our long friend|&s;hip,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; it would be affectation any longer to pre|tend

Yes, Sir, you are &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me;

the right, had not courage to condemn the wrong.

took name from &s;ome neighbouring duty. Your
charity, that was but inju&s;tice; your benevolence,
that was but weakne&s;s; and your friend&s;hip, but
credulity. I &s;aw, with regret, great talents, and
exten&s;ive learning, only employed to add &s;prightli|ne&s;s

<P>Cea&s;e to upbraid me, Sir: I have for &s;ome time

But there is one way &s;till left me. Yes, Sir, I have
determined this very hour, to quit for ever a place
where I have made my&s;elf the voluntary &s;lave of all;
and to &s;eek among &s;trangers that fortitude which
may give &s;trength to the mind, and mar&s;hal all its
di&s;&s;ipated virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit me to
&s;olicit favour for this gentleman; who, notwith|&s;tanding
what has happened, has laid me under the
mo&s;t &s;ignal obligations. Mr. Lofty&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood, I'm re&s;olved upon a reforma|tion,
as well as you. I now begin to find, that the
man who fir&s;t invented the art of &s;peaking truth
was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him.
And, to prove that I de&s;ign to &s;peak truth for the
future, I mu&s;t now a&s;&s;ure you, that you owe your
late enlargement to another; as, upon my &s;oul, I
had no hand in the matter. So now if any of the

keep its own fools at home! In my time, the

follies of the town crept &s;lowly among us, but now

<P>No, Mr. Ha&s;tings; no. Prudence once more

<P><STAGE>(In her own natural manner)</STAGE> I believe the&s;e &s;uffer|ings
cannot be very great, Sir, which you can &s;o ea|&s;ily
remove. A day or two longer, perhaps, might

<P><STAGE>(A&s;ide)</STAGE> This girl every moment improves upon
me. <STAGE>(To her)</STAGE> It mu&s;t not be, madam. I have al|ready
trifled too long with my heart. My very
pride begins to &s;ubmit to my pa&s;&s;ion. The di&s;parity
of education and fortune, the anger of a parent, and
the contempt of my equals, begin to lo&s;e their
<PB N="259" REF="263">
weight; and nothing can re&s;tore me to my&s;elf, but
this pain&s;ul effort of re&s;olution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then go, Sir. I'll urge nothing more to detain
you. Though my family be as good as hers you
came down to vi&s;it, and my education, I hope, not
inferior, what are the&s;e advantages without equal
affluence? I mu&s;t remain contented with the &s;light
approbation of imputed merit; I mu&s;t have only the
mockery of your addre&s;&s;es, while all your &s;erious
aims are fixed on fortune.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heavens, madam, fortune was ever my &s;malle&s;t

for who could &s;ee that without emotion. But every
moment that I conver&s;e with you, &s;teals in &s;ome
new grace, heightens the picture, and gives it
&s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion. What at fir&s;t &s;eem'd ru&s;tic
plainne&s;s, now appears re&s;in'd &s;implicity. What
<PB N="260" REF="264">
&s;eem'd forward a&s;&s;urance, now &s;trikes me as the re|&s;ult
of courageous innocence, and con&s;cious virtue.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now determined to &s;tay, madam, and I have
too good an opinion of my father's di&s;cernment,
when he &s;ees you, to doubt his approbation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s HARDCASTLE.</P>
<P>No, Mr. Marlow, I will not, cannot detain you.
Do you think I could &s;uffer a connexion, in which
there is the &s;malle&s;t room for repentance? Do you
think I would take the mean advantage of a tran|&s;ient
pa&s;&s;ion, to load you with confu&s;ion? Do you
think I could ever reli&s;h that happine&s;s, which was
acquired by le&s;&s;ening yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all that's good, I can have no happine&s;s but
what's in your power to grant me. Nor &s;hall I ever
feel repentance, but in not having &s;een your merits
before. I will &s;tay, even contrary to your wi&s;hes;
and though you &s;hould per&s;i&s;t to &s;hun me, I will
make my re&s;pectful a&s;&s;iduities atone for the levity of
my pa&s;t condu&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I mu&s;t entreat you'll de&s;i&s;t. As our ac|quaintance
began, &s;o let it end, in indifference. I

might have given an hour or two to levity; but &s;e|riou&s;ly,
Mr. Marlow, do you think I could ever &s;ub|mit

and you imprudent? do you think I could
ever catch at the confident addre&s;&s;es of a &s;ecure ad|mirer?</P>
