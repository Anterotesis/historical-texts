<P>IN examining a Religion, which pretends to come from God, one of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> things which forceth it&s;elf upon our attention, is the <HI>Influence</HI> of its <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Precepts</HI> upon human <HI>Felicity.</HI> If the natural ten|dency of <HI>the&s;e,</HI> be to <HI>regulate</HI> the pa&s;&s;ions, and to <HI>promote</HI> the general Happine&s;s of Mankind; a &s;trong pre&s;umption ari&s;eth, that its preten&s;ions to a divine origin, <HI>may</HI> be well founded. But if a Religion obvi|ou&s;ly tendeth to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> human happine&s;s, or
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to <HI>di&s;turb the peace of Society</HI>; we may, with|out further examination, conclude with <HI>cer|tainty,</HI> that it cometh <HI>not</HI> from that great, and beneficent Being, who (far from de|lighting in the mi&s;ery of his creatures) would have <HI>all</HI> to be pious, and virtuous, <HI>only,</HI> that <HI>all</HI> may be finally, and com|pletely happy, in tho&s;e realms where Death hath no dominion.</P>
<P>Viewed in <HI>this</HI> light, Chri&s;tianity is <HI>emi|nently</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed above every other reli|gious In&s;titution, which hath hitherto pre|vailed in the world. It teacheth in per|fection, the duties of <HI>Man</HI> to <HI>Man</HI>; it affordeth <HI>divine</HI> aids to <HI>human</HI> weakne&s;s; and encourageth the practice of what it &s;heweth to be good, by motives the mo&s;t engaging, and the mo&s;t exalted.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian Religion exhorteth us to be mindful of <Q REND="inline">what&s;oever things are true, hone&s;t, ju&s;t, pure, lovely, or of good report</Q>&mdash;to forgive our enemies, to love our neighbours as our&s;elves, to do good, as
<PB N="3" REF="5">
we have opportunity, to every individual of the human race, and, as much as lieth in us, to live peaceably with all men.</P>
<P>In Society <HI>only</HI> are the&s;e duties <HI>practica|ble</HI>; and, without Government and Subor|dination, <HI>Society could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</HI> There|fore the divine Author, and Fini&s;her of our Faith, <HI>in order to give efficacy to his other commands,</HI> enforced obedience to the civil Magi&s;trate <HI>by an injunction of the Go&s;pel,</HI> requiring his followers to <Q REND="inline">render unto <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the things that were <HI>Cae&s;ar's,</HI></Q>  as well as <Q REND="inline">unto <HI>God</HI> the things that were <HI>God's.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ame</HI> cour&s;e of &s;alutary in&s;truction, was faithfully pur&s;ued by the Apo&s;tles, and others, the fir&s;t Preachers of Chri&s;tianity; who earne&s;tly exhorted their Converts to <Q REND="inline">render to <HI>all</HI> their dues; tribute to whom tribute was due; cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;|tom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour; to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&s;ake; whether to the King as &s;upreme, or to Magi&s;trates, as unto them, who are &s;ent by him for the Puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well.</Q></P>
<P>To <HI>the&s;e</HI> Precepts of <HI>Civil Obedience</HI> no objection of importance hath ever been made. They are (on the contrary) ap|plauded both by the believer, and by the unbeliever,&mdash;by him who reverenceth the Go&s;pel, as the power of God unto Salva|tion,&mdash;and by him who con&s;idereth it as a cunningly devi&s;ed fable, calculated <HI>merely</HI> to erect a Dominion over the con&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>But the Precept of my <HI>Text,</HI> hath fre|quently been viewed in a light <HI>le&s;s favour|able.</HI> It, <HI>certainly &s;uppo&s;eth</HI> an Authority different from that of the <HI>civil</HI> Magi&s;trate, <HI>who&s;e</HI> Duty is to watch, <HI>not</HI> for the <HI>Souls, but</HI> for the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> of his &s;ub|jects; and to <HI>that</HI> Authority St. Paul, here, enjoineth an <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the <Q REND="inline">chil|dren
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of this world</Q> are <HI>little willing to pay.</HI></P>
<P>It would be idle to rea&s;on in &s;upport of <HI>&s;piritual Authority</HI> with &s;uch as doubt, or deny the divine origin of the Go&s;pel; for THESE MEN mu&s;t be convinced that they HAVE SOULS, before they can be per&s;uaded to enquire WHO are appointed to <HI>watch</HI> for them; to WHOM, on <HI>that</HI> account, their obedience is due; or WHAT is the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the obedience required.</P>
<P>THEY are not, however, ALL infidels, who <HI>deny</HI> the reality of &s;piritual Powers;&mdash;for many &s;incere believers in Chri&s;tianity contend that, under the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;a|tion, there is nothing which bears the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to an exclu&s;ive Prie&s;t|hood; that the Authority which is &s;up|po&s;ed in my Text, either cea&s;ed with the Apo&s;tles; or that (if it &s;till continueth in the Church) it can be conferred on one cla&s;s of Chri&s;tians, <HI>only,</HI> by the <HI>Election</HI> of others; and that, <HI>therefore,</HI> we are bound
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to obey it, <HI>no farther,</HI> than is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> in the conduct of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>That, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord gave to none of his immediate followers Authority or Ju|ri&s;diction, of <HI>&s;uch a nature</HI> as, to interfere with the Rights of the Rulers of the Earth, is, indeed, an undoubted Truth,&mdash;for <HI>all &s;uch Authority</HI> was di&s;claimed by <HI>Him&s;elf</HI>; <Q REND="inline">My kingdom,</Q> &s;aid He to Pilate, <Q REND="inline">is not of this world</Q>&mdash;And, upon being a&s;ked by a certain per&s;on to decide a <HI>que&s;|tion of Property</HI> between him and his bro|ther, his Reply was, <Q REND="inline">Man&mdash;<HI>who</HI> made <HI>me</HI> a Judge, or a Divider over you?</Q> But when it is con&s;idered that, Chri&s;t came into the world to <Q REND="inline">turn men from Dark|ne&s;s unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God;</Q>  that, <Q REND="inline">He gave him|&s;elf for us, that He might redeem us from <HI>all</HI> Iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf a peculiar people <HI>zealous</HI> of good works</Q>&mdash;and that of <HI>the&s;e works very many</HI> are &s;uch
<PB N="7" REF="9">
as unregenerate humanity cannot perform; and that the <HI>Doctrines</HI> which he revealed, are &s;uch as <HI>human Rea&s;on</HI> could <HI>never</HI> have di&s;covered; it will be &s;een how <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> it was that, when he a&s;cended into Heaven, he &s;hould &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome <HI>Authority,</HI> on Earth, to <HI>illu&s;trate the Revelation</HI> which he had <HI>given,</HI> and to <HI>enforce obedience</HI> to the <HI>Laws</HI> which he had <HI>enacted.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing more &s;trictly required of Chri&s;tians, than that they &s;hould live together in <HI>Unity</HI>; profe&s;&s;ing the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Faith, joining in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Wor&s;hip, and practi&s;ing the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Virtues on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Principles. Now, as Men have <HI>different</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions, Prejudices, and Pur&s;uits, <HI>&s;uch Unity</HI> would be impo&s;&s;ible, were they <HI>not</HI> linked together in <HI>one</HI> Society; under the Government of Per&s;ons authori&s;ed to <HI>watch over the Faith,</HI> to <HI>pre&s;cribe the Forms of pub|lic Wor&s;hip,</HI> and to <HI>inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and <HI>explain the Nature</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>&s;everal Virtues.</HI></P>

In the Scriptures of the New Te&s;tament, the Society of Chri&s;tians is (on account of its unity and organization) compared to the human body; <Q REND="inline">for as we have <HI>many</HI> members in <HI>one</HI> body, and all members have not the <HI>&s;ame office</HI>; &s;o <HI>we,</HI> being many, are <HI>one Body</HI> in Chri&s;t, and every one <HI>members one of another.</HI></Q> (<BIBL>Rom. XII. 4. 5</BIBL>)&punc;   This Society of Believers, in our common Deliverer, is called the CHURCH, 'the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI>',&mdash;and 'the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI>'; and ITS affairs (like the affairs of every other Kingdom) are admini&s;tered by <HI>proper</HI> officers in &s;ubordination to <HI>the one Lord</HI>; who <Q REND="inline">when he a&s;cended on high, and led captivity captive, gave <HI>&s;ome</HI> Apo&s;tles, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> Prophets, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> Evangeli&s;ts, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> Pa&s;tors, and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying of the body of Chri&s;t; that, henceforth we &s;hould be <HI>no more</HI> children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried

about with <HI>every</HI> wind of Doctrine, by the &s;leight of men, and cunning crafti|ne&s;s whereby they lie in wait to de|ceive; but &s;peaking the truth in love, may grow up into <HI>Him</HI> in all things, which is the Head, even Chri&s;t, from <HI>whom</HI> the whole Body fitly joined toge|ther, and compacted by <HI>that</HI> which every joint &s;upplieth, according to the effec|tual working in the mea&s;ure of <HI>every</HI> part, maketh increa&s;e of the body unto the edifying of it&s;elf in love.</Q> (<BIBL>Ephe&s;. IV. 11. 12. 14. 15. 16.</BIBL>)</P>
<P>Now,&mdash;of <HI>this</HI> Society (as of a philo&s;ophi|cal Sect) it is <HI>not</HI> left to <HI>every</HI> man's choice, as a thing indifferent, whether or <HI>not</HI> he will become a Member. ALL who em|brace the Faith of the Redeemer of the world, are required to be <HI>baptized,</HI> under the pain of forfeiting the <HI>benefits of Redemp|tion.</HI> (St. Mark, XVI. 16.&mdash;St. John, III. 5.) But <HI>one great purpo&s;e</HI> propo&s;ed by the in&s;titution of Bapti&s;m, was the Initia|tion
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of Per&s;ons into the Church of Chri&s;t; <Q REND="inline">For <HI>by one Spirit</HI></Q>  (&s;aith St. Paul, <BIBL>1 Cor. XII. 13. 27. 28. 29.</BIBL>) <Q REND="inline">are we all bap|tized <HI>into one Body,</HI> whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.</Q></P>
<P>Of <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> (whatever be the Import|ance) it is evident that to receive it is, <HI>not</HI> (like moral Ju&s;tice, or the Veneration of the Supreme Being) a Duty re&s;ulting from the <HI>Nature of the Relations of Man</HI>; and that <HI>all</HI> its efficacy (which in Scripture is &s;aid to be <HI>nothing le&s;s than the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> Acts II. 38. and XXII. 16.) is derived from <HI>po|&s;itive In&s;titution,</HI> and can accompany the external Rite, <HI>only,</HI> when <HI>that</HI> Rite is ad|mini&s;tered in the <HI>manner pre&s;cribed,</HI> and by the <HI>per&s;ons authori&s;ed</HI> to admini&s;ter it.</P>
<P>That <HI>all Chri&s;tians,</HI> in common, are <HI>not</HI> ve&s;ted with this authority, is plain from the Commi&s;&s;ion, which (after his Re&s;ur|rection) the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us gave to his Apo&s;|tles. We are a&s;&s;ured that the number of
<PB N="11" REF="13">
his followers was then <HI>five hundred at lea&s;t</HI>; but it was ONLY to the ELEVEN DISCI|PLES that <Q REND="inline">He came and &s;pake &s;aying, All power is given unto me in Heaven, and Earth; Go YE therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> (<BIBL>St. Matthew, XXVIII. 16. 17. 18. 19.</BIBL>)  Now there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that there were not <HI>many</HI> of the five hundred well qualified to in&s;truct either a Jew, or a Gentile, in the doctrines of the the Go&s;pel; and it is certain, that <HI>any one</HI> of them could have wa&s;hed his Converts with water in the Name of the Holy Trinity, as well as St. Peter, or St. John: but then, &s;uch an <HI>unauthorized wa&s;hing</HI> would not have been <HI>Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m,</HI> or of equal Validity with <HI>it,</HI> any more than the <HI>Opinion</HI> of a <HI>Lawyer at the Bar,</HI> is the <HI>Judgement of a Court of Ju&s;tice,</HI> or of equal obligation: It is the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of the Sovereign</HI> which gives force to the <HI>Judgement of the Court</HI>; as it is

According to this Suppo&s;ition, the Apo&s;tolical Pre&s;byters mu&s;t have been inve&s;ted, as it is contended they were, with all the powers of modern Bi&s;hops&mdash;with the power of preaching, of admi|ni&s;tering the Sacraments, and of <HI>&s;ending</HI> Labourers into Chri&s;t's Vineyard: But it is notorious that, <HI>at the Reforma|tion,</HI> and in <HI>every prior period of the Church</HI> of which Hi&s;tory makes mention, there were <HI>three Orders of Mini&s;ters,</HI> of which the <HI>Second</HI> was authorized to preach the Go&s;pel, and to admini&s;ter the Sacraments, but <HI>not</HI> to <HI>&s;end</HI> La|bourers into Chri&s;t's Vineyard, which was the Prerogative of the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> alone: That <HI>&s;econd</HI> Order, being, therefore, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>unknown</HI> in the Apo&s;tolic Age, mu&s;t have been introduced into the Church, by <HI>no competent Au|thority.</HI> But it is from <HI>it</HI> that the Pre&s;byterians derive their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> which, therefore, upon their <HI>own</HI> Principles, MUST BE TOTALLY VOID. Hence it follows that &s;hould the Epi&s;copal Church be granted to have deviated from the Apo&s;tolic Model, which (if any Credit be due to the ob|vious <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and the unanimous <HI>Verdict</HI> of <HI>An|tiquity</HI>) <HI>&s;he has not done</HI>; &s;till <HI>&s;he</HI> is corrupted <HI>only</HI> in <HI>one</HI> part, whereas the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Sect</HI> re&s;ts <HI>wholly upon a hu|man foundation.</HI>&mdash;See this Argument &s;tated more fully, and maintained again&s;t much ingenious Sophi&s;try, in DR.
