<P>_NOTHING can more &s;trongly &s;econd the Plea&s;ure I feel, from

Other which I take in pre&s;uming to &s;helter it under Your Name. I bear &s;o

my greate&s;t Ambition that <PB REF="5"> this Piece &s;hould be received into
the Protection of &s;uch a Patron: And, I hope, Future Times, when they mean to
pay <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> the be&s;t Compliment, will remember to &s;ay, Mr.
DODINGTON was that Friend to his <HI>Remains,</HI> which his own SOUTHAMPTON
was to his <HI>living Merit.</HI></P>
<P>It is from the <HI>fine Di&s;cernment</HI> of our Patrons, that we
can ge|nerally be&s;t promi&s;e Our&s;elves the good Opinion of the Publick.
You are not only a di&s;tingui&s;h'd <HI>Friend</HI> of the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI>

think it impo&s;&s;ible a <PB REF="6"> Manu&s;cript of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>

Integrity, and Honour en|gages the warme&s;t Wi&s;hes of all good Men for your

<PB REF="8">
<HEAD>PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Succe&s;s, which this Play has met with from the Town in the
Repre&s;entation, (to &s;ay nothing of the Reception it found from tho&s;e
Great Judges, to whom I have had the Honour of communica|ting it in
Manu&s;cript;) has almo&s;t made the Pur|po&s;e of a Preface unnece&s;&s;ary:
And therefore what I have to &s;ay, is de&s;ign'd rather to wipe out a flying
Objection to two, than to labour at proving it the Production of
<HI>Shake|&s;peare.</HI> It has been alledg'd as incredible, that &s;uch a
Curio&s;ity &s;hould be &s;tifled and lo&s;t to the World for above a Century.
To This my An&s;wer is &s;hort; that tho' it never till now made its Appearance
on the Stage, yet one of the Manu&s;cript Copies, which I have, is of above
Sixty Years Standing, in the Hand|writing of Mr. <HI>Downes,</HI> the famous
Old Prompter; and, as I am credibly inform'd, was early in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cele|brated Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> and by Him
de&s;ign'd to have been u&s;her'd into the World. What Accident prevented This
Purpo&s;e of his, I do not pretend to know: Or thro' what hands it had
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively pa&s;s'd before that Period of Time. There is a Tra|dition
(which I have from the Noble Per&s;on, who &s;upply'd me with One of my Copies)
that it was given by our Author, as a Pre&s;ent of Value, to a Natural Daughter
of his, for who&s;e Sake he wrote it, in the Time of his Retirement from the
Stage. Two other Copies I have, (one of which I was glad to purcha&s;e
<PB REF="9"> at a very good Rate,) which may not, perhaps, be quite &s;o Old as
the Former; but One of Them is much more perfect, and has fewer Flaws and
Interruptions in the Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Another Objection has been &s;tarted, (which would carry much more
Weight with it, were it Fact;) that the Tale of this Play, being built upon a
Novel in <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> Chronology is again&s;t Us, and
<HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> could not be the Author. But it happens, that <HI>Don
Quixot</HI> was publi&s;h'd in the Year 1611, and <HI>Shake|&s;peare</HI> did
not dye till <HI>April</HI> 1616, a &s;ufficient Interval of Time for All that
We want granted.</P>
<P>Others again, to depreciate the Affair, as they thought, have been
plea&s;ed to urge, that tho' the Play may have &s;ome Re&s;em|blances of
<HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> yet the <HI>Colouring, Diction,</HI> and
<HI>Chara|cters,</HI> come nearer to the Style and Manner of FLETCHER. This, I
think, is far from de&s;erving any An&s;wer; I &s;ubmit it to the Determination
of better Judgments; tho' my Partiality for <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> makes me
wi&s;h, that Every Thing which is good, or plea&s;ing, in our Tongue, had been
owing to his Pen.</P>
<P>As to the Performance of the re&s;pective <HI>Actors</HI>
concern'd in this Play, my applauding It here would be altogether
&s;uper|fluous. The Publick has di&s;tingui&s;h'd and given them a Prai&s;e,
much beyond Any that can flow from my Pen. But I have &s;ome particular
Acknowledgments to make to the <HI>Managers</HI> of this Company, for which I
am glad to embrace &s;o fair an Op|portunity.</P>
<P>I came to Them at this Juncture as an <HI>Editor,</HI> not an
<HI>Au|thor,</HI> and have met with &s;o much Candour, and hand&s;ome Treatment
from Them, that I am willing to believe, the Complaint, which has &s;o commonly
obtain'd, of their Di&s;re|gard and ill Behaviour to Writers, has been more
&s;everely urg'd, than it is ju&s;tly grounded. They mu&s;t certainly be too
good Judges of their own Intere&s;t, not to know that a Theatre cannot always
&s;ub&s;i&s;t on old Stock, but that the Town requires Novelty at their Hands.
On the other Hand, they mu&s;t be &s;o far Judges of their own Art and
Profe&s;&s;ion, as to know that all the Compo&s;itions, which are offer'd them,
would never go down with Audiences of &s;o nice and deli|cate a Ta&s;te, as in
this Age frequent the Theatres. It would be very hard upon &s;uch a Community,
where &s;o many Intere&s;ts are concern'd, and &s;o much Merit in their
Bu&s;i|ne&s;s allow'd, if they had not a Priviledge of refu&s;ing &s;ome crude
Pieces, too imperfect for the Entertainment of the Pub|lick I would not be
thought to inferr, that they have ne|ver di&s;courag'd what They might,
perhaps, afterwards wi&s;h they had receiv'd. They do not, I believe, &s;et up
for &s;uch a Con&s;tant <PB REF="10"> Infallibility. But if We do but fairly
con&s;ider out of a|bove Four Thou&s;and Plays extant, how &s;mall a Number
will now &s;tand the Te&s;t: if We do but con&s;ider too, how often a raw
Performance has been extoll'd by the Partiality of private Friend&s;hip; and
what a Clamour of Injury has been rais'd from that Quarter, upon &s;uch
Performance meeting a Repul&s;e; we may pretty ea&s;ily account for the Grounds
upon which they proceeded in di&s;countenancing &s;ome Plays, and the har&s;h
Things that are thrown out upon their giving a Repul&s;e to others.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould beg Pardon for interfering in this Que&s;tion, in
which I am properly neither Party, nor Judge. I am only throwing out a private
Opinion, without Intere&s;t or Prejudice, and if I am right in the Notion,
<HI>Valeat quantum valere pote&s;t.</HI></P>
