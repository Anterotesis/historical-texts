<HEAD>REASONS For not Replying to Mr. <HI>WALTON</HI>'s FULL ANSWER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. _THERE are &s;ome Men that can neither give nor take an An&s;wer, but writing mere|ly for the &s;ake of writing multiply words to no pur|po&s;e. There are al&s;o cer|tain carele&s;s Writers, that in defiance of com|mon &s;en&s;e publi&s;h &s;uch things as, though they are not a&s;ham'd to utter, yet, other men may well be a&s;ham'd to an&s;wer. Whether there be
<PB N="4" REF="4">
any thing in Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s method of vindi|cating Fluxions, that might ju&s;tify my taking no further notice of him on the abovemention|ed con&s;iderations, I leave you and every other Reader to judge. But tho&s;e, Sir, are not the rea&s;ons I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign for not replying to Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s full An&s;wer. The true rea&s;on is, that he &s;eems at bottom a facetious man, who under the colour of an opponent writes on my &s;ide of the Que&s;tion, and really believes no more than I do of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Doctrine about Fluxions, which he expo&s;es, contradicts, and confutes with great skill and humour, under the ma&s;que of a grave vindication.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. AT fir&s;t I con&s;ider'd him in another light, as one who had good rea&s;on for keeping to the beaten Track, who had been u&s;ed to dictate, who had terms of art at will, but was indeed, at &s;mall trouble about putting them together, and perfectly ea&s;y about his Reader's under&s;tanding them. It mu&s;t be owned, in an Age of &s;o much ludicrous humour, it is not e|very one can at fir&s;t &s;ight di&s;cern a Writer's real de&s;ign. But, be a man's A&s;&s;ertions ever &s;o &s;trong in favour of a Doctrine, yet if his Rea|&s;onings
<PB N="5" REF="5">
are directly levelled again&s;t it, whate|ver Que&s;tion there may be about the matter in Di&s;pute, there can be none about the Intenti|on of the Writer. Should a Per&s;on, &s;o know|ing and di&s;creet as Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> thwart and contradict Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> under pretence of defending his Fluxions, and &s;hould he at eve|ry turn &s;ay &s;uch uncouth things of the&s;e &s;ame Fluxions, and place them in &s;uch odd lights, as mu&s;t &s;et all men in their Wits again&s;t them, could I hope for a better &s;econd in this Cau&s;e? or could there remain any doubt of his being a di&s;gui&s;ed Freethinker in Mathematics, who defended Fluxions ju&s;t as a certain Freethinker in Religion did the Rights of the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>III. MR. <HI>Walton</HI> indeed after his free man|ner calls my <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> a Libel. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Vindication,</HI> p. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> But this inge|nious Gentleman well knows a bad Vindicati|on is the bittere&s;t Libel. Had you a mind, Sir, to betray and ridicule any Cau&s;e under the No|tion of vindicating it, would you not think it the right way to be very &s;trong and dogmatical
<PB N="6" REF="6">
in the Affirmative, and very weak and puzzled in the argumentative Parts of your Perfor|mance? To utter Contradictions and Paradoxes without Remor&s;e, and to be at no pains about reconciling or explaining them? And with great good humour to be at perpetual vari|ance with your&s;elf and the Author you pre|tend to vindicate? How &s;ucce&s;sfully Mr. <HI>Wal|ton</HI> hath practi&s;ed the&s;e Arts, and how much to the honour of the great Client he would &s;eem to take under his protection, I &s;hall par|ticularly examine throughout every Article of his full An&s;wer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>IV. FIRST then, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> <Q REND="inline">I am to be asked, whether I can conceive Velocity without Motion, or Motion without Exten|&s;ion, or Exten&s;ion without Magnitude?</Q> To which he an&s;wereth in po&s;itive Terms, that he can conceive Velocity and Motion in a Point (<HI>P.</HI> 7). And to make out this, he un|dertakes to demon&s;trate, <Q REND="inline">that if a thing be moved by an Agent operating continually with the &s;ame force, the Velocity will not be the &s;ame in any two different Points of the de&s;cribed Space. But that it mu&s;t va|ry
<PB N="7" REF="7">
upon the lea&s;t change of Space.</Q> Now admitting thus much to be demon&s;trated, yet I am &s;till at a lo&s;s to perceive, how Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s Conclu&s;ion will follow, to wit, <Q REND="inline">that I am greatly mi&s;taken in imagining there can be no Motion, no Velocity in a Point of Space</Q> (<HI>P.</HI> 10). Pray, Sir, con&s;ider his Rea&s;oning. The &s;ame Velocity cannot be in two Points of Space; therefore Velocity can be in a Point of Space. Would it not be ju&s;t as good Rea|&s;oning to &s;ay, the &s;ame man cannot be in two Nut&s;hels; therefore a Man can be in a Nut|&s;hel? Again, Velocity mu&s;t vary upon the lea&s;t change of Space; therefore there may be Velocity without Space. Make Sen&s;e of this if you can. What have the&s;e Con&s;equences to do with their Premi&s;es? Who but Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> could have inferred them? Or how could even he have inferred them, had it not been in je&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>V. SUPPOSE the Center of a falling Bo|dy to de&s;cribe a Line, divide the time of its Fall into equal Parts, for in&s;tance into minutes. The Spaces de&s;cribed in tho&s;e equal parts of Time will be unequal. That is, from what|&s;oever
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Points of the de&s;cribed Line you mea|&s;ure a minute's de&s;cent, you will &s;till find it a different Space. This is true. But how or why from this plain truth a Man &s;hould infer, that Motion can be conceived in a Point, is to me as ob&s;cure as any the mo&s;t ob&s;cure my&s;te|ries that occur in this profound Author. Let the Reader make the be&s;t of it. For my Part, I can as ea&s;ily conceive Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> &s;hould walk without &s;tirring, as I can his Idea of Motion without Space. After all, the Que&s;ti|on was not whether Motion could be proved to exi&s;t in a Point, but only whether it could be conceived in a Point. For, as to the proof of things impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ome men have a way of proving that may equally prove any thing. But I much que&s;tion whether any Reader of common Sen&s;e will undertake to conceive what this plea&s;ant Man at Inference undertakes to prove.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>VI. IF Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> really meant to defend the Author of the Fluxionary Method, would he not have done it in a Way con&s;i&s;tent with this illu&s;trious Author's own Principles? Let us now &s;ee what may be Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Notion,
<PB N="9" REF="9">
about this matter. He di&s;tingui&s;heth two &s;orts of motion, ab&s;olute and relative. The former he defineth to be a Tran&s;lation from ab&s;olute place to ab&s;olute place, the latter from one re|lative place to another. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL><HI>Schol. def. viii. Philo&s;. Nat. Princip. Math.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s is plainly neither of the&s;e &s;orts of Motion, but &s;ome third kind, which what it is, I am at a lo&s;s to comprehend. But I can clearly com|prehend that, if we admit Motion without Space, then Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Account of it mu&s;t be wrong: For place by which he defines Motion is, according to him, a part of Space. And if &s;o, then this notable Defender hath cut out new Work for him&s;elf to defend and explain. But about this, if I mi&s;take not, he will be very ea&s;y. For, as I &s;aid before, he &s;eems at bottom a back Friend to that great Man; which Opinion you will &s;ee further con|firmed in the Sequel.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>VII. I SHALL no more ask Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> to explain any thing. For I can hone&s;tly &s;ay, the more he explains, the more I am puzzled. But I will ask his Readers to explain, by what Art a Man may conceive Motion without
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Space. And &s;uppo&s;ing this to be done, in the &s;econd place to explain, how it con&s;i&s;ts with Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Account of Motion. Is it not evident, that Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> hath de&s;erted from his old Ma&s;ter, and been at &s;ome pains to expo&s;e him, while he defends one Part of his Principles by overturning another? Let a|ny Reader tell me, what Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> means by Motion, or if he can gue&s;s, what this third kind is, which is neither ab&s;olute nor relative, which exi&s;ts in a Point, which may be con|ceiv'd without Space. This learned Profe&s;&s;or &s;aith, <Q REND="inline">I have no clear Conception of the Principles of Motion</Q> (<HI>P.</HI> 24). And in a|nother place (<HI>P.</HI> 7.) he &s;aith,  <Q REND="inline">I might have conceived Velocity in a Point, if I had un|der&s;tood and con&s;idered the nature of Moti|on.</Q> I believe I am not alone in not under|&s;tanding his Principles. For my&s;elf, I freely confe&s;s the Ca&s;e to be de&s;perate. I neither un|der&s;tand them, nor have any hopes of being e|ver able to under&s;tand them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<P>VIII. BEING now &s;atisfied, that Mr. <HI>Wal|ton</HI>'s aim is not to clear up or defend Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Principles, but rather to contradict and expo&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="11">
them, you will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, think it &s;trange, if in&s;tead of putting Que&s;tions to this intrepid An|&s;werer, who is never at a lo&s;s, how often &s;oe|ver his Readers may, I entreat you, or any o|ther Man of plain Sen&s;e, to read the following Pa&s;&s;age cited from the thirty fir&s;t Section of the Analy&s;t, and then try to apply Mr. <HI>Wal|ton</HI>'s An&s;wer to it: Whereby you will clearly perceive what a vein of Raillery that Gentle|man is Ma&s;ter of. <Q REND="inline">Velocity nece&s;&s;arily im|plies both Time and Space, and cannot be conceived without them. And if the Velo|cities of na&s;cent and evane&s;cent Quantities, <HI>i. e.</HI> ab&s;tracted from time and &s;pace, may not be comprehended, how can we comprehend and demon&s;trate their Proportions? or con|&s;ider their <HI>rationes primae &amp; ultimae.</HI> For to con&s;ider the Proportion or Ratio of Things implieth that &s;uch Things have Magnitude: That &s;uch their Magnitudes may be mea&s;ur|ed, and their Relations to each other known. But, as there is no mea&s;ure of Velocity ex|cept Time and Space, the proportion of Ve|locities being only compounded of the direct proportion of the Spaces and the reciprocal Proportion of the Times; doth it not follow,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
that to talk of inve&s;tigating, obtaining, and con&s;idering the proportions of Velocities, ex|clu&s;ively of Time and Space, is to talk un|intelligibly?</Q> Apply now, as I &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s full An&s;wer and you will &s;oon find how fully you are enlightened about the Na|ture of Fluxions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<P>IX. IN the following Article of Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s full An&s;wer, he &s;aith divers curious things, which, being derived from this &s;ame Principle, that motion may be conceived in a point, are altogether as incomprehen&s;ible as the Origine from whence they flow. It is obvious and na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Ab</HI> and <HI>Ba</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL><HI>Nat. Phil. Princip. Math. l.</HI> 2. <HI>lem.</HI> 2.</BIBL></NOTE> to be Rectan|gles produced from finite lines multiplied by Increments. Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> indeed &s;uppo&s;eth that when the Increments vani&s;h or become no|thing, the Velocities remain, which being mul|tiplied by finite lines produce tho&s;e Rectangles (<HI>P.</HI> 13.) But admitting the Velocities to re|main, yet how can any one conceive a Rect|angular
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Surface to be produced from a line mul|tiplied by Velocity, otherwi&s;e than by &s;uppo&s;|ing &s;uch line multiplied by a line or Increment, which &s;hall be exponent of or proportional to &s;uch Velocity? You may try to conceive it otherwi&s;e. I mu&s;t own I cannot. Is not the Increment of a Rectangle it &s;elf a Rectangle? mu&s;t not then <HI>Ab</HI> and <HI>Ba</HI> be Rectangles? and mu&s;t not the Coefficients or Sides of Rectangles be lines? con&s;equently are not <HI>b</HI> and <HI>a</HI> lines or (which is the &s;ame thing) Increments of lines? the&s;e Increments may indeed be con&s;idered as proportional to and exponents of Velocity. But exclu&s;ive of &s;uch exponents to talk of Rectan|gles under lines and velocities is, I conceive, to talk unintelligibly. And yet this is what Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> doth, when he maketh <HI>b</HI> and <HI>a</HI> in the Rectangles <HI>Ab</HI> and <HI>Ba</HI> to denote mere Velo|cities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<P>X. As to the Que&s;tion, whether nothing be not the Product of nothing multiplied by &s;ome|thing, Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> is plea&s;ed to an&s;wer in the affirmative. And neverthele&s;s when <HI>ab</HI> is no|thing, that is, when <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are nothing, he denies that <HI>Ab</HI> &plus; <HI>Ba</HI> is nothing. This is one
<PB N="14" REF="14">
of the&s;e many Incon&s;i&s;tencies which I leave the Reader to reconcile. But, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> the Sides of the given Rectangle &s;till remain, which two Sides according to him mu&s;t form the Increment of the flowing Rectangle. But in this he directly contradicts Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who a&s;&s;erts that <HI>Ab</HI> &plus; <HI>Ba</HI> and not <HI>A</HI> &plus; <HI>B</HI> is the Increment of the Rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> And, indeed, how is it po&s;&s;ible, a line &s;hould be the Increment of a Surface? <HI>Laterum Incrementis totis</HI> a <HI>et</HI> b <HI>generatur Rectanguli incrementum Ab</HI> &plus; <HI>Ba</HI> are the Words of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL><HI>Nat. Phil. Princip. Math. l.</HI> 2. <HI>lem.</HI> 2.</BIBL></NOTE>. which words &s;eem utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with Mr. <HI>Wal|ton</HI>'s Doctrine. But, no wonder that Gentle|man &s;hould not agree with Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;ince he cannot agree even with him&s;elf; but contradicts what he &s;aith el&s;ewhere as the Reader may &s;ee, even before he gets to the End of that &s;ame Section, wherein he hath told us that <Q REND="inline">the Gnomon and the Sum of the two Rectan|gles are turned into tho&s;e two Sides by a re|troverted Motion</Q> (<HI>P.</HI> 11 &amp; 12). which
<PB N="15" REF="15">
propo&s;ition if you or any other Per&s;on &s;hall try to make Sen&s;e of, you may po&s;&s;ibly be convin|ced, that this profound Author is as much at variance with common Sen&s;e, as he is with him&s;elf and Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI></P>

<P>XI. MR. <HI>Walton</HI> in the ninth Page of his Vindication, in order to explain the Nature of Fluxions, &s;aith that <Q REND="inline">to obtain the la&s;t ratio of &s;ynchronal Increments, the magnitude of tho&s;e Increments mu&s;t be infinitely dimini&s;h|ed.</Q> Notwith&s;tanding which, in the twenty third Page of his full An&s;wer he chargeth me as greatly mi&s;taken, in &s;uppo&s;ing that he ex|plained the Doctrine of Fluxions by the ratio of Magnitudes infinitely dimini&s;hed. It is an ea&s;y matter, for any Author to write &s;o, as to betray his Readers into Mi&s;takes about his meaning. But then it is not ea&s;y to conceive, what right he hath to upbraid them with &s;uch their Mi&s;takes. If I have mi&s;taken his Sen&s;e, let any one judge if he did not fairly lead me in|to the Mi&s;take.

<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<P>XII. IN the twentieth Page of his full An|&s;wer Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> tells us, that <Q REND="inline">Fluxions are mea&s;ured by the fir&s;t or la&s;t proportions of i&s;ochronal Increments generated or de&s;troy|ed by motion.</Q> A little after he &s;aith the&s;e Ratios &s;ub&s;i&s;t when i&s;ochronal Increments have no Magnitude. Now, I would fain know whether the i&s;ochronal Increments them&s;elves &s;ub&s;i&s;t when they have no Magnitude? whe|ther by i&s;ochronal Increments we are not to under&s;tand Increments generated in equal times? whether there can be an Increment where there is no increa&s;e, or increa&s;e where there is no Magnitude? whether if Magnitudes are not ge|nerated in tho&s;e equal times, what el&s;e is ge|nerated therein, or what el&s;e is it that Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> calls i&s;ochronal?

<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<P>XIII. We are told (<HI>P.</HI> 22.) <Q REND="inline">that the fir&s;t or la&s;t ratio of the i&s;ochronal Spaces hath a real exi&s;tence, fora&s;much as it is e|qual to the ratio of the two motions of two points; which motions, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting when the i&s;ochronal Spaces are nothing; pre&s;erve the exi&s;tence of the fir&s;t or la&s;t ratio of the&s;e Spaces, or keep it from being a ratio of no|things.</Q> In order to a&s;&s;i&s;t your under&s;tand|ing, it mu&s;t not be omitted that the &s;aid two points are &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t at the &s;ame time in one point, and to be moved different ways without &s;tirring from that point. Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> hath the Con&s;cience to call this Riddle a full and clear An&s;wer: to make &s;en&s;e of which you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it one of his Ironies.

<P>XIV. It will be allowed, that who ever &s;e|riou&s;ly undertook to explain the &s;econd, third, and fourth Fluxions of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> would

have done it in a way agreeable to that great Man's own Doctrine. What Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s preci&s;e notion is I will not petend to &s;ay. And yet I will venture to &s;ay, it is &s;omething that cannot be explained by the three dimen&s;ions of a Cube I frankly own, I do not under&s;tand Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Doctrine &s;o far as to frame a po&s;itive Idea of his Fluxions. I have, neverthele&s;s, a nega|tive conception thereof, &s;o far as to &s;ee that Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> is in je&s;t, or (if in earne&s;t) that he under&s;tands it no more than I do.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<P>XV. Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> tells us that he con&s;iders in|determinate quantities as flowing, or in other words, as increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing by a perpetu|al motion. Which quantities he denotes by the latter Letters of the Alphabet, and their Fluxions or Celerities of increa&s;ing by the &s;ame Letters pointed over head, and the Fluxions of Fluxions or &s;econd Fluxions, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Muta|tions more or le&s;s &s;wift of the fir&s;t Celerities by the &s;ame Letters pointed with double points; and the Mutations of tho&s;e Mutations of the fir&s;t Mutations or Fluxions or Celerities of in|crea&s;ing, which he calls Fluxions of Fluxions of Fluxions or third Fluxions, by three

Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> you &s;ee, &s;peaks of quantity in general. And in the Analy&s;t the Doctrine is exemplified and the Ca&s;e is put in lines. Now in lines, where there is only one Dimen&s;ion, how are we enabled to conceive &s;econd, third or fourth Fluxions by conceiving the generation of three dimen&s;ions in a Cube? Let any one but read what Sir <HI>I|&s;aac Newton</HI> or what I have &s;aid, and then ap|ply what Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> hath written about the three dimen&s;ions of a Cube, and &s;ee whether the difficulties are &s;olved or the Doctrine made one whit the clearer by this Explication.</P>

<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<P>XVI. That you may the better judge of the merit of this Part of Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s performance, I &s;hall beg leave to &s;et down a Pa&s;&s;age or two from the Analy&s;t. <Q REND="inline">As it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive Velocity without time or &s;pace, without either finite length or finite duration, it mu&s;t &s;eem above the Power of Man to comprehend even the fir&s;t Fluxions.

But mo&s;t Men, I believe, will find it impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand them in any &s;en&s;e what&s;oever. One would think that Men could not &s;peak too exactly on &s;o nice a &s;ub|ject. And yet we may often ob&s;erve, that the exponents of Fluxions or notes repre&s;ent|ing Fluxions are confounded with the Flux|ions them&s;elves. Is not this the Ca&s;e, when ju&s;t after the Fluxions of flowing quantities, were &s;aid to be celerities of their increa&s;ing and the &s;econd Fluxions to be the Mutati|ons of the fir&s;t Fluxions or celerities, we are told that <GAP DESC="math"> repre&s;ents a &s;eries of quantities whereof each &s;ub&s;equent quantity is the Fluxion of the preceding; and each foregoing is a fluent quantity having the following one for it's Fluxion.

<P>XVII. BUT it doth not become me to find fault with this learned Profe&s;&s;or, who at bot|tom militates on my Side, and in this very Section, makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s directly to over|throw Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Doctrine. For he &s;aith in plain Terms, that there can be no fourth Fluxion of a Cube (<HI>P.</HI> 25.) that is, there can be no &s;econd Fluxion of a line, and <HI>a fortiori,</HI> no third, fourth, fifth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In&s;o|much that with one &s;ingle da&s;h of his Pen Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> de&s;troys, to the great relief of the learned World, an indefinite rank of Fluxions
<PB N="22" REF="22">
of different Orders that might have reached from Pole to Pole. I had di&s;tinctly pointed out the difficulties in &s;everal Parts both of my Analy&s;t and Defence, and I leave you to judge whether he explains or even attempts to explain one of them. In&s;tead thereof he tells us of the true Dimen&s;ion of a Cube generated by Moti|on: Whence he takes occa&s;ion, as hath been ob&s;erved, to explode Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s own Doctrine, which is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s And can you now doubt the real de&s;ign of this egregious Vindicator.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<P>XVIII. BEFORE ever Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> thought of his Fluxions, every body knew there were three Dimen&s;ions in a Cube, and that a Solid might be generated by the motion of a Surface, a Surface by the motion of a Line, and a Line by the motion of a Point. And this in effect is all we know from Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s Explication. As for his dwelling &s;o minutely on the Gene&s;is of the &s;olid Parts of a Cube, a thing &s;o foreign from the Purpo&s;e, the only rational Account I can give of it is, that Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> by puzzling the Imagination of his vulgar Readers, hoped the better to di&s;|gui&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="23">
his betraying the Doctrine of his great Client, which to a di&s;cerning eye he manife&s;t|ly gives up; and in&s;tead thereof humourou&s;ly &s;ub&s;titutes, what all the World knew before Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was born, to wit, the three Dimen&s;i|ons of a Cube and the gene&s;is thereof by Mo|tion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="section">
<P>XIX. UPON the whole I appeal to you and every intelligent Reader, whether this thing, which <HI>Walton</HI> is plea&s;ed ironically to call a full An&s;wer, doth not carry through|out a fly In&s;inuation, that the profound Sci|ence of Fluxions cannot be maintained but by the help of mo&s;t unintelligible Paradoxes and Incon&s;i&s;tencies. So far, indeed, as Affirmati|ons go he &s;heweth him&s;elf an able Support of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> But then in his Rea|&s;onings he drops that great man upon the mo&s;t important Points, to wit, his Doctrine of Mo|tion and his Doctrine of Fluxions, not regard|ing how far the demon&s;tration of his famous Principia is intere&s;ted therein. To convince you &s;till more and more of the Truth hereof, do but reflect a little on Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s Conduct. Can you think it probable, that &s;o learned and
<PB N="24" REF="24" MS="y">
clear-headed a Writer would have laid down &s;uch a direct repugnancy to common Sen&s;e, as his Idea of Motion in a Point, for the ground work of his Explanation, had it been his real Intention to explain? Or can you &s;uppo&s;e, he would have been ab&s;olutely &s;ilent, on &s;o many Points urged home, both in the Analy&s;t and Defence, which it concerned a Vindicator of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> not to have overlooked? Can you ima|gine, that if he meant &s;eriou&s;ly to defend the Doctrine of Fluxions, he would have content|ed him&s;elf with barely a&s;&s;erting that <Q REND="inline">Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> in the Introduction to his Quadra|ture of Curves, in the &s;econd Lemma of the &s;econd Book, and in the Scholium to the fir&s;t Section of the fir&s;t Book of his Princi|ples of Philo&s;ophy, hath delivered his Doc|trine of Fluxions in &s;o clear and di&s;tinct a manner, without the lea&s;t Incon&s;i&s;tency in terms or Arguments, that one would have thought it impo&s;&s;ible for any Per&s;on not to have under&s;tood him</Q> (<HI>P.</HI> 30).</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="section">
<P>XX. IS it po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, that Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> could in earne&s;t hope we &s;hould take his bare Word, as &s;o much more credible that Sir <HI>I|&s;aac</HI>'s,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
and not rather have endeavoured to an|&s;wer the Que&s;tions and reconcile the Difficul|ties &s;et forth in my Defence of Free-thinking, for in&s;tance, in Sect xxxvi. Wherein I intreat my Antagoni&s;t to explain <Q REND="inline">whether Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Momentum be a finite Quantity or an In|finite&s;imal or a mere Limit, <HI>adding,</HI> if you &s;ay a finite Quantity, be plea&s;ed to reconcile this with what he &s;aith in the Scholium of the &s;econd Lemma of the fir&s;t Section of the fir&s;t Book of his Principles: <HI>Cave intelligas quantitates magnitudine determinatas, &s;ed cogita &s;emper diminuendas &s;ine limite.</HI> If you &s;ay an Infinite&s;imal: Reconcile this with what is &s;aid in the Introduction to his Qua|dratures: <HI>Volui o&s;tendere quod in methodo Fluxionum non opus &s;it figuras infinite parvas in Geometriam introducere.</HI> If you &s;hould &s;ay it is a mere Limit, be plea&s;ed to recon|cile this with what we find in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e of the &s;econd Lemma in the &s;econd Book of his Principles: <HI>Ubi de lateribus</HI> A &amp; B <HI>deerant momentorum dimidia,</HI> &amp;c. where the Moments are &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided.</Q> I &s;hall &s;carce think it worth my while to be&s;tow a &s;erious thought on any Writer who &s;hall pre|tend
<PB N="26" REF="26">
to maintain Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Doctrine, and yet leave this Pa&s;&s;age without a Reply. And the Reader, I believe, will think with me that, in an&s;wer to difficulties di&s;tinctly propo&s;ed and in|&s;i&s;ted on, to offer nothing but a magi&s;terial A&s;|&s;ertion is a mere grimace of one who made merry with Fluxions, under the Notion of de|fending them. And he will be further con|firmed in this way of thinking, when he ob|&s;erves that Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> hath not &s;aid one Syl|lable, in Reply to tho&s;e &s;everal Sections of my Defence, which I had particularly referred to, as containing a full an&s;wer to his Vindication. But it is no wonder if, with Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Doc|trine, he &s;hould drop al&s;o his own Arguments in favour thereof.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="section">
<P>XXI. I HAVE been at the Pains once for all to write this &s;hort Comment on Mr. <HI>Wal|ton,</HI> as the only way I could think of for mak|ing him intelligible, which will al&s;o &s;erve as a Key to his future Writings on this Subject. And I was the rather inclined to take this trou|ble, becau&s;e it &s;eemeth to me, there is no part of Learning that wants to be clear'd up more than this &s;ame Doctrine of Fluxions, which hath hi|therto
<PB N="27" REF="27">
walked about in a mi&s;t to the Stupefac|tion of the Literati of the pre&s;ent Age. To conclude, I accept this Profe&s;&s;or's Recantation, nor am at all di&s;plea&s;ed at the ingenious me|thod he takes to di&s;gui&s;e it. Some zealous Flu|xioni&s;t may perhaps an&s;wer him.</P>
