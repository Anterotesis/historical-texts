<P>COULD &s;ome gentlemen of approved ability have been prevailed
upon to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject of the following Ode, the pre&s;ent
apology would have been unnece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;but as it was requi&s;ite to
produce &s;omething of this kind upon the occa&s;ion, and the lot
having unluckily fallen on the per&s;on perhaps the lea&s;t qualified to
&s;ucceed in the attempt, it is hoped the candour of the public will
e&s;teem the performance rather as an act of duty, than vanity in the
author.</P>
<P>As &s;ome news-paper writers have illiberally endeavoured to &s;hake
the poetic character of our immortal bard (too deeply indeed rooted
in the heart to be affected by them) it is recommended to tho&s;e
who are not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed in their dramatic faith, to peru&s;e
a work lately publi&s;hed, called, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on the Writings and Genius
of</HI> SHAKESPEARE, by which they will with much &s;atisfaction be
convinced, that <HI>England</HI> may ju&s;tly boa&s;t the honour of producing
the greate&s;t dramatic poet in the world.</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen and ju&s;tify the general admiration of this a&s;toni&s;h|ing
Genius, it has been thought proper to &s;ubjoin to the Ode &s;ome
undeniable Te&s;timonies (both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e) of his unequalled
original talents.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall be found, that <HI>&s;peaking</HI> that part of the Ode, which
has u&s;ually been conveyed in recitative, produces a better effect,
the Author flatters him&s;elf he may lay claim to &s;ome little merit on
that account: As to the Ode it&s;elf, he pre&s;ents it to the public as
an object of their good-nature,&mdash;to his friends as an exerci&s;e of
their partiality,&mdash;to his enemies, as a lucky opportunity of venting
their wit, humour, critici&s;m, &s;pleen, or whatever el&s;e they plea&s;e,
&s;hould they think it worthy of their notice.</P>

Though there are many, many more poets who have &s;poken of
<HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI> with equal prai&s;e and admiration, yet the&s;e, which
fir&s;t occurred, were thought &s;ufficient.&mdash;Le&s;t any of our readers
&s;hould think with a certain gentleman, who, upon hearing <HI>Milton</HI>'s
ver&s;es in prai&s;e of <HI>SHAKESPEARE,</HI> &s;aid, He never regarded what
was &s;aid in poetry,&mdash;that the very nature of it was fiction, and
had no value without it,&mdash;there is added &s;ome undeniable te&s;ti|monies
in pro&s;e, of <HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI>'s unparalleled genius.</P>
<Q><P>&mdash;SHAKESPEARE was a man, who, of all modern, and
perhaps ancient poets, had the large&s;t and mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive
&s;oul. All the images of Nature were &s;till pre&s;ent to him, and he
drew them not labouriou&s;ly, but luckily: when he de&s;cribes any
thing, you more than &s;ee it, you feel it too. Tho&s;e who accu&s;e
him to have wanted learning, give him the greater commendation:
he was naturally learned: he needed not the &s;pectacles of books to
read Nature; he looked inwards, and found her there. I cannot
&s;ay he is every where alike; where he &s;o, I &s;hould do him injury
to compare him with the greate&s;t of mankind. But he is always
great, where &s;ome great occa&s;ion is pre&s;ented to him: No man
can &s;ay he ever had a fit &s;ubject for his wit, and did not then rai&s;e
him&s;elf as high above the re&s;t of poets,
<Q>Quantum lenta &s;olent inter viburna cupre&s;&s;i.</Q></P>
<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>Among the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> SHAKESPEARE has incomparably excelled
all others. That noble extravagance of fancy, which he had in
&s;o great perfection, thoroughly qualified him to touch this weak
&s;uper&s;titious part of his reader's imagination; and made him ca|pable
of &s;ucceeding, when he had nothing to &s;upport him be&s;ides
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the &s;trength of his own genius. There is &s;omething &s;o wild, and
yet &s;o &s;olemn, in the &s;peeches of his gho&s;ts, fairies, witches, and
the like imaginary per&s;ons, that we cannot forbear thinking them
natural, though we have no rule by which to judge of them, and
mu&s;t confe&s;s, if there are &s;uch beings in the world, it looks highly
probable they &s;hould talk and act as he has repre&s;ented them.</P>
<P>&mdash;Our inimitable SHAKSPEARE is a &s;tumbling-block to the
whole tribe of the&s;e rigid criticks: who would not rather read one
of his plays, when there is not a &s;ingle rule of the &s;tage ob&s;erved,
than any production of a modern critic, where there is not one of
them violated? SHAKESPEARE was indeed born with all the &s;eeds
of poetry, and may be compared to the &s;tone of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>'s ring,
which, as <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us, had the figure of Apollo and the nine
mu&s;es in the viens of it, produced by the &s;pontaneous hand of
Nature without any help from art.</P>
<BIBL>ADDISON.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>But certainly the greatne&s;s of this Author's genius does no where
&s;o much appear, as where he gives his imagination an entire loo&s;e,
and rai&s;es his fancy to a flight above mankind, and the limits of the
vi&s;ible world.</P>
<BIBL>ROWE.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>If ever any author de&s;erved the name of an original it was
SHAKESPEARE. Homer him&s;elf drew not his art &s;o immediately
from the fountains of Nature, it proceeded through Egyptian
&s;tainers and channels, and came to him not without &s;ome tincture
of the learning, or &s;ome ca&s;t of the models of tho&s;e before him.
The poetry of SHAKESPEARE was in&s;piration indeed: he is not &s;o
much an imitator, as an in&s;trument of Nature; and it is not &s;o ju&s;t
to &s;ay that he &s;peaks from her, as that &s;he &s;peaks through him.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
His characters are &s;o much Nature her&s;elf, that it is a &s;ort of in|jury
to call them by &s;o di&s;tant a name as copies of her. Tho&s;e of
other poets have a con&s;tant re&s;emblance, which &s;hews that they re|ceived
them from one another, and were but multipliers of the
&s;ame image: each picture, like a mock rainbow, is but the re|flection
of a reflection. But every &s;ingle character in SHAKESPEARE
is as much an individual, as tho&s;e in life it&s;elf; it is as impo&s;&s;ible to
find any two alike; and &s;uch as from their relation or affinity in any
re&s;pect appear mo&s;t to be twins, will, upon compari&s;on, be found
remarkably di&s;tinct. To this life and variety of character, we mu&s;t
add the wonderful pre&s;ervation of it; which is &s;uch throughout
his plays, that had all the &s;peeches been printed without the very
names of the per&s;ons, I believe one might have applied them with
certainty to every &s;peaker.</P>
<P>The power over our pa&s;&s;ions was never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a more eminent
degree, or di&s;played in &s;o different in&s;tances. Yet all along, there is
&s;een no labour, no pains to rai&s;e them; no preparation to guide
our gue&s;s to the effect, or to be perceived to lead toward it: but
the heart &s;wells, and the tears bur&s;t out, ju&s;t at the proper places:
we are &s;urprized the moment we weep; and yet upon reflection
find the pa&s;&s;ion &s;o ju&s;t, that we &s;hould be &s;urprized if we had not
wept, and wept at that very moment.</P>
<P>How a&s;toni&s;hing is it again, that the pa&s;&s;ions directly oppo&s;ite to
the&s;e, Laughter and Spleen, are no le&s;s at his command! That he
is not more a ma&s;ter of the great, than of the ridiculous, in human
nature; of our noble&s;t tenderne&s;&s;es, than of our vaine&s;t foibles;
of our &s;tronge&s;t emotions, than of our idle&s;t &s;en&s;ations!</P>
<P>Nor does he only excel in the pa&s;&s;ions; in the coolne&s;s of re|flection
and rea&s;oning, he is full as admirable. His &s;entiments are
not only in general the mo&s;t pertinent and judicious upon every
&s;ubject, but by a talent very peculiar, &s;omething between pene|tration
<PB N="29" REF="30">
and felicity, he hits upon that particular point on which the
bent of each argument turns, or the force of each moment de|pends.
This is perfectly amazing, from a man of no education
or experience in tho&s;e great and public &s;cenes of life, which are
u&s;ually the &s;ubject of his thoughts: &s;o that he &s;eems to have known
the world by intuition, to have looked through human nature at one
glance, and to be the only author that gives ground for a very new
opinion, That the philo&s;opher, and even the man of the world,
may be born as well as the poet.</P>

<P>In how many points of light mu&s;t we be obliged to gaze at

the force and greatne&s;s of his genius, the extent of his
knowledge and reading, the power and addre&s;s with which he
throws out and applies either Nature, or Learning, there is ample
&s;cope both for our wonder and plea&s;ure. If his diction, and the
cloathing of his thoughts attract us, how much more mu&s;t we be

images and ideas &s;teal into our &s;ouls, and &s;trike upon our fancy,
how much are they improved in price, when we come to reflect with
what propriety and ju&s;tne&s;s they are applied to character! If we

look into his characters, and how they are furni&s;hed and propor|tioned
to the employment he cuts out for them, how are we taken
up with the ma&s;tery of his portraits! What draughts of Nature!
What variety of originals, and how differing from each other! How

<Q><P>&mdash;If &s;uch another poet could ari&s;e, &s;hould I very vehemently
reproach him, that his fir&s;t act pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Venice,</HI> and his next at
<HI>Cyprus.</HI> Such violations of rules merely pa&s;&s;ive, becomes the com|prehen&s;ive
Genius of SHAKESPEARE, and &s;uch cen&s;ures are &s;uitable
to the minute and &s;lender critici&s;m of Voltaire:

<L>Serventur leges, malint a Cae&s;are telli.</L></Q></P>

This therefore is the prai&s;e of SHAKESPEARE, that his drama is
the mirrour of life; that he who has mazed his imagination, in fol|lowing
the phantoms which other writers rai&s;e up before him, may
here be cured of his delirious exta&s;ies, by reading human &s;enti|ments
in human language; by &s;cenes from which a hermit may
e&s;timate the tran&s;actions of the world, and a confe&s;&s;or predict the
progre&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

the world all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance or plea&s;ure it can receive from the mo&s;t

<Q><P>It is &s;aid of the o&s;trich, that &s;he drops her egg at random, to be

&s;uch, at lea&s;t, is the account which naturali&s;ts has given us
of this extraordinary bird; and admitting it for a truth, &s;he is in
this a fit emblem of almo&s;t every great genius; they conceive and
produce with ea&s;e tho&s;e noble i&s;&s;ues of human under&s;tanding; but
incubation, the dull work of putting them correctly upon paper,
and afterwards publi&s;hig, is a ta&s;k they cannot away with. If the
original &s;tate of all &s;uch author's writings, even from <HI>Homer</HI> down|ward,
could be inquired into and known, they would yield proof
in abundance of the ju&s;tne&s;s of what is here a&s;&s;erted: but the author
now before us &s;hall &s;uffice for them all; being at once the greate&s;t
in&s;tance of genius in producing noble things, and of negligence in
providing for them afterwards.</P>

<P>There was a time, when the art of John&s;on was &s;et above the
divine&s;t raptures of SHAKESPEARE. The pre&s;ent age is well con|vinced
of the mi&s;take. And now the Genius of SHAKESPEARE is
idolized in its turn. Happily for the public ta&s;te it can &s;carcely be
too much &s;o.</P>
<BIBL>HURD.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>SHAKESPEARE is a kind of e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in poetry, and
his bays will always flouri&s;h with undimini&s;hed verdure. When
I &s;ay this, I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions,
but for every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion he recompences his auditors
with beauties which no art will ever equal. That the notes
e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> are agreeable to nature, I am
ready to allow, and that inferior geniu&s;es may avail them&s;elves by
a &s;kilful conformity to them, I as freely a&s;&s;ent to. But fable is but
a &s;econdary beauty; the exhibition of character, and the excite|ment
of the pa&s;&s;ions, ju&s;tly claim the precedence in dramatic
poetry. It is in writing as in gardening, where nature does not
afford &s;pontaneous beauties, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ments
of &s;low and endeavouring art, to the regularity of uniform
vi&s;tas, the intricacy of elaborate mazes, and a &s;tudied in&s;ertion of
ever-greens; but when the cour&s;e of the country of it&s;elf pre&s;ents
attractive &s;cenes on every &s;ide, when the trees branch out with a
free expan&s;ion, and the bold pro&s;pect &s;urprizes with the heath, the
lawn, the hill, and valley in wild variety, the littlene&s;s of tedious
culture is unnece&s;&s;ary, and trifling ornaments are unlooked for.</P>

<P><HI>Voltaire</HI> is a genius, but not of SHAKESPEARE's magnitude
Without recurring to di&s;putable authority, I appeal from <HI>Voltaire</HI>
to him&s;elf. I &s;hall not avail my&s;elf of his former encomiums on
our mighty poet; though the <HI>French</HI> critic has twice tran&s;lated the
&s;ame &s;peech in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> &s;ome years ago in admiration, latterly in de|ri&s;ion;
and I am &s;orry to find that his judgment grows weaker,
when it ought to be further matured.</P>

<Q><P>Such is SHAKESPEARE's merit, that the more ju&s;t and refined the
ta&s;te of the nation has become, the more he has increa&s;ed in re|putation.
He was approved by his own age, admired by the next,
and is revered, and almo&s;t adored by the pre&s;ent. His merit is
di&s;puted by little wits, and his errors are the je&s;ts of little critics;
but there has not been a great poet, or great critic, &s;ince his time,
who has not &s;poken of him with the highe&s;t veneration, Mr. <HI>Vol|taire</HI>
excepted. His tran&s;lations often, his critici&s;ms &s;till oftener,
prove he did not perfectly under&s;tand the words of the author: and
therefore it is certain he could not enter into his meaning. He com|prehended
enough to perceive he was unob&s;ervant of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed
rules of compo&s;ition; the felicity with which he performs what no
rules can teach, e&s;capes him. Will not an intelligent &s;pectator ad|mire
the prodigious &s;tructures of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> becau&s;e he does not
know by what law of mechanics they were rai&s;ed? Like them our
author's works will remain for ever the greate&s;t monuments of the
amazing force of nature, which we ought to view as we do other
prodigies, with an attention to, and admiration of their &s;tupendous
parts, and proud irregularity of greatne&s;s.</P>
