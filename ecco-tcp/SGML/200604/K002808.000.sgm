<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE unfortunate have a &s;trong claim to every &s;ervice we can render them; and that man is the happie&s;t who has mo&s;t opportunities of lightening the load of wo with which the mo&s;t virtuous, as well as the mo&s;t profligate, are often oppre&s;&s;ed. If we cannot relieve, we &s;hould ever &s;ym|pathi&s;e with the &s;ons and daughters of af|fliction. But if we are ignorant of their &s;orrows till death has kindly placed them beyond the reach of per&s;ecution, the only attention we can then &s;how them, is to tran&s;mit their &s;ufferings and their virtues to po&s;terity;&mdash;who, though their &s;orrows
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
may long have cea&s;ed, will not refu&s;e to bedew the melancholy page with the tear of &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>Not having had the happine&s;s of know|ing the Marquis of Clerville or his Maria, I had it not in my power to attempt an al|leviation of their &s;orrows.&mdash;If I had, my attempt might not have been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. But many are the revolving years that have elap&s;ed &s;ince Clerville and Ma|ria cea&s;ed to &s;igh. The only attention I I can now pay the illu&s;trious pair, is to per|petuate their unhappy fate.</P>
<P>The Marquis of Clerville fell an early victim at the &s;hrine of hopele&s;s love. He
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
adored a woman who proved her&s;elf wor|thy of him; and who exhibited a fortitude of mind that mu&s;t excite the admiration, while her misfortunes claim the pity, of &s;ucceeding ages. She even preferred mi|&s;ery to peace, when the latter could only be purcha&s;ed by what &s;he thought the happine&s;s of her Clerville.</P>
<P>The Author is con&s;cious that the fol|lowing &s;heets may contain many errors; but tru&s;ts they will be pardoned, when it is con&s;idered that he wrote, not to immor|talize <HI>him&s;elf</HI> but MARIA.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>FIFTEEN years had ju&s;t elap&s;ed from the birth of the Marquis of Clerville, when he was deprived of
<PB N="12" REF="9">
his father. His mother had no &s;ooner paid the la&s;t rites to her lord's memo|ry, than &s;he removed from the family|&s;eat at Clerville to Paris, taking with her the young Marquis; who, more from nece&s;&s;ity than choice, plunged at once into all the di&s;&s;ipation of the capital. His mother's fir&s;t care, on her arrival, was to procure for her &s;on a commi&s;&s;ion in the guards, that he might have an opportunity of mix|ing with men of his own rank.&mdash;Here commenced his acquaintance with the Baron Fitzou. In him he found a true friend, who was willing to &s;acrifice even his life in his &s;er|vice; and who endeavoured, but
<PB N="13" REF="10">
in vain, to prevent the misfortunes which afterwards befel him. The Marquis continued in the guards till he was of age; when that good &s;en&s;e of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, led him to &s;ee the folly of a life &s;pent in a conti|nual round of di&s;&s;ipation and idle vi&s;its. He therefore determined to quit the &s;ervice, and retire to Clerville, where he hoped to &s;pend his time more to his own &s;atisfaction than he had hi|therto done. He imparted his de&s;ign to no one but his friend the Baron; who, however fooli&s;h he might think it, &s;eeing his friend determined, gave his approbation. The Marquis, de|lighted to find his plan approved by
<PB N="14" REF="11">
Fitzou, re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion; and without &s;taying to hear the cen&s;ures of his companions, &s;et out for Cler|ville, having fir&s;t reque&s;ted his mo|ther to pa&s;s the &s;ummer with him: With which reque&s;t &s;he complied, in hopes to reclaim her &s;on, whom &s;he now con&s;idered as mad. On his ar|rival at Clerville, he found the hou&s;e much out of order, and the grounds like a de&s;art; but he was too much determined with re&s;pect to his plan, to have his re&s;olution &s;haken by &s;o &s;light an ob&s;tacle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="15" REF="12">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marquis had &s;carcely reached Clerville, when he received let|ters from all his quondam companions, rallying him in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, on a re&s;olution which, they affirmed, was condemned by all Paris, and which had expo&s;ed him to the ridicule of all his friends and acquaintances. To the&s;e letters the Marquis returned no an&s;wer, but that he mu&s;t &s;ubmit
<PB N="16" REF="13">
with patience to their ridicule, as he was determined to per&s;evere in a plan which to him appeared to be highly rational. In a few days the Marchio|ne&s;s appeared, laden with epi&s;tolary admonitions from his uncles; which, bating that they were treated with more apparent re&s;pect, met with no better fate than did tho&s;e of his gay companions.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s attempted to rally her &s;on on his romantic plan; but finding he was not to be laughed out of it, &s;he endeavoured to prevail by rea&s;oning with him. Her arguments, however, produced no better effect
<PB N="17" REF="14">
than her railleries; and the Marquis remained fixed in his intention of &s;et|tling at Clerville. The &s;ummer was &s;pent in fruitle&s;s remon&s;trances on the part of the Marchione&s;s, and unheed|ed replies on that of the Marquis. When the &s;ea&s;on drew near when the Marchione&s;s was to return to the circle of her gay friends, &s;he became more urgent than ever that her &s;on &s;hould return with her to the honours of Ver&s;ailles and the amu&s;ements of Pa|ris. But having made one great ef|fort, and that proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, &s;he bid him adieu; hoping neverthe|le&s;s to reclaim him, after he &s;hould have &s;pent a &s;olitary winter in the
<PB N="18" REF="15">
rookery at Clerville. On her arrival at Paris, all his former companions flocked to her hou&s;e, not doubting that they &s;hould there find the Mar|quis, cured of all his romantic ideas. But on hearing that he had with&s;tood all his mother's intreaties, and their ridicule, they de&s;paired of &s;eeing him till next winter.</P>
<P>The Marquis, in the mean time, was pur&s;uing his &s;tudies and his im|provements with vigour. He &s;pent the morning in viewing his e&s;tate and improving his plea&s;ure-grounds; while his afternoons were either devoted to &s;tudy, or to vi&s;iting tho&s;e of his neigh|bours,
<PB N="19" REF="16">
the narrowne&s;s of who&s;e for|tunes prevented them from &s;hining in the beau monde.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="20" REF="17">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>IN this manner had the whole win|ter elap&s;ed, undi&s;tingui&s;hed by any remarkable event, when the Marquis received a vi&s;it from his old friend the Baron Fitzou, with whom he had kept up a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence; but who, till then, had been prevent|ed from vi&s;iting Clerville by his ab|&s;ence from France. The Marquis re|ceived
<PB N="21" REF="18">
him with all tho&s;e demon&s;tra|tions of joy which are natural at the &s;ight of one who is dear to us, and from whom we have been long &s;epa|rated. The Baron expre&s;&s;ed the ut|mo&s;t &s;atisfaction at finding his friend plea&s;ed with the plan which he had cho&s;en, and which he owned had not at fir&s;t appeared to him &s;o ra|tional as it now did.</P>
<P>A few days after the Baron's arri|val, as they were walking in the park, they ob&s;erved at &s;ome di&s;tance a car|riage; which, on a clo&s;er in&s;pection, proved to be that of the Marchione&s;s. On the &s;ight of her &s;on, &s;he alighted;
<PB N="22" REF="19">
was by him received with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and conducted to the ca&s;tle; where dinner being &s;erved up, pre|vented tho&s;e reflections on his mode of life, which he above all things dreaded.</P>
<P>The cloth was, however, no &s;ooner removed, than &s;he inquired, whe|ther he did not now &s;ee the folly of his conduct, in retiring from the world at a time when he was mo&s;t qualified for enjoying it? To this inquiry the Marquis made an&s;wer, That had his manner of life been honoured with her approbation, he &s;hould have been completely happy, as nothing but her
<PB N="23" REF="20">
di&s;like of it could render it di&s;agree|able. The Marchione&s;s, by no means edified with an an&s;wer &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to what &s;he wi&s;hed, after ha|ving &s;taid a few days at the ca&s;tle, re|turned to Ver&s;ailles, de&s;pairing of ever reclaiming her &s;on.</P>
<P>The Baron &s;oon after received a &s;ummons to attend the King; and the Marquis was left, by his depar|ture, in his u&s;ual &s;olitude. A &s;oli|tude, however, which was frequently and agreeably interrupted by the vi|&s;its of Mon&s;ieur Fenelon, the cur&eacute; of the pari&s;h: a man of exten&s;ive learn|ing, gentle manners, true piety, and
<PB N="24" REF="21">
liberal &s;entiments.&mdash;With &s;uch a neighbour, it was impo&s;&s;ible that the Marquis &s;hould ever feel <HI>ennui.</HI> By his a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had recovered his knowledge of the cla&s;&s;ics, and was be|come an excellent &s;cholar.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE godde&s;s of Content had hi|therto re&s;ided with her favour|ite votary at Clerville: but the melan|choly hour of her exile was at hand, and a le&s;s friendly deity was &s;oon to fix his abode there. The Marquis had not as yet burnt incen&s;e at the altar of Cytherea; but the little god, jealous of his own and his mother's
<PB N="26" REF="23">
honour, aimed a gall-&s;teeped arrow at his heart; and he who, till then, had never &s;acrificed, was doomed him&s;elf to fall an early victim at the &s;hrine of love.</P>
<P>The Marquis, one day as he was riding, being overtaken by a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, repaired for &s;helter to a neighbouring farm-hou&s;e; the beauty of who&s;e &s;ituation, as well as its vicinity, tempted him to vi&s;it it. On his entrance, he found the ma|&s;ter, his wife, and only daughter, &s;eated at a ru&s;tic board. He no &s;oon|er appeared, than he was invited to partake of the rural repa&s;t; an invi|tation
<PB N="27" REF="24">
which he accepted without he|&s;itation. But the lu&s;tre of Maria's eyes &s;o engaged his attention, that it was with difficulty he could comply with the pre&s;&s;ing invitations of the old people to eat. The &s;torm di&s;appear|ing, he with reluctance quitted the cottage; where, at that in&s;tant, he would have been glad to &s;pend his days, provided he might enjoy the company of Maria.</P>
<P>Maria's charms had made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of the Mar|quis to permit of his not &s;oon repeat|ing his vi&s;it. Accordingly, in a few days, on pretence of thanking them
<PB N="28" REF="25">
for their ho&s;pitality, he returned to the cottage (the inhabitants of which had now learnt the rank of their gue&s;t), that he might contemplate the charms of the fair ru&s;tic. As he ap|proached the hou&s;e, he perceived Maria &s;itting under the &s;hade of a large elm, with a book in her hand. He in&s;tantly alighted; and, advan|cing, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her. But Maria, di&s;concerted at his appearance, and reflecting on the ea&s;y manner in which they had formerly treated him, fled to the hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitation, dropping her book; which was eagerly &s;eized by the Marquis. He then proceeded to the cottage.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="26">
The old people, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t degree at the &s;ight of the Mar|quis, apologi&s;ed, in an aukward manner, for the treatment he had ex|perienced at his former vi&s;it; decla|ring, that nothing but their ignorance of his rank could excu&s;e their con|duct. The Marquis, who was ever amiable, was by no means inclined to be har&s;h to any thing connected with Maria. He received their ex|cu&s;es with politene&s;s; begged them to be compo&s;ed; thanked them for their ho&s;pitality; and, notifying to them his intention of dining with them, re&s;tored to the cottage its u&s;ual tranquillity.&mdash;The old people, de|fighted
<PB N="30" REF="27">
with the Marquis, prepared for dinner, whil&s;t the amu&s;ement of their noble gue&s;t was entru&s;ted to Ma|ria.&mdash;A ta&s;k plea&s;ing in it&s;elf; but for which &s;he was then but ill quali|fied, on account of her embarra&s;&s;ment and ne&s;cience of the world.</P>
<P>Dinner, however, &s;oon relea&s;ed Maria from her tete-a-tete with the Marquis; and the whole family &s;at down to a neat but frugal board. Dinner being ended, the Marquis re|que&s;ted Maria's leave to vi&s;it the dairy. With this reque&s;t &s;he could not re|fu&s;e to comply; and accordingly at|tended him to the &s;cene of his hap|pie&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="28">
hours. During their conver&s;a|tion, he was &s;o &s;truck with her mo|de&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e, that he a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to repeat his vi&s;it. Maria blu&s;hed con&s;ent; and the Marquis having taken leave of the old people, returned to Clerville, leaving Maria in a &s;tate of mind to which &s;he had been a &s;tranger previous to her ac|quaintance with him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="32" REF="29">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>BUT before I proceed farther in my narrative, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to give &s;ome de&s;cription of Ma|ria's mental accompli&s;hments; for as her per&s;onal charms beggared all de|&s;cription, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over in &s;i|lence. Her father, though not a man of much learning him&s;elf, had (by advice of the Cur&eacute;) &s;pared no pains
<PB N="33" REF="30">
on her education. Mu&s;ic, painting, &amp;c. were accompli&s;hments for which &s;he was indebted to the vicinage of a convent, where &s;he was placed from twelve to fifteen. The Cur&eacute; had early implanted in her brea&s;t tho&s;e &s;enti|ments of piety and virtue which, aid|ed by an uncommon &s;ortitude, &s;up|ported her in tho&s;e trying &s;ituations in which &s;he was afterwards placed.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered, that by a woman &s;o accompli&s;hed, and &s;o hand|&s;ome, a deep impre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be made on a &s;en&s;ible heart. The Mar|quis frequently repeated his vi&s;its; which at la&s;t alarming the old people,
<PB N="34" REF="31">
they now cautioned their daughter again&s;t him, as a man who, however amiable he might appear, would not, &s;hould opportunity offer, he&s;itate to ruin her. Maria, terrified by this admonition, received the Marquis at his next vi&s;it with a coldne&s;s that a&s;to|ni&s;hed him. He was not long at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of this altera|tion in her conduct, from whom he now dreaded an eternal &s;eparation. The mention of marriage was not to be thought of; and, from the check he had ju&s;t received, he had no great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s on any other ground.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="32">
In this dilemma, he applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to an aunt of Maria's; who rendered her&s;elf unworthy of &s;uch a niece, by concurring with the Mar|quis in his de&s;ign upon her virtue. She undertook to deliver to Maria the Marquis's propo&s;als; which were &s;uch as might be expected from a young man deeply enamoured, whom re&s;pect for the ab&s;urd maxims of the world prevented from matching him|&s;elf with one of inferior rank. They were received by Maria with de&s;erved contempt; and &s;he gave the Marquis to under&s;tand, that &s;he never more would &s;ee a man who had been ca|pable
<PB N="36" REF="33">
of offering her &s;uch an in|&s;ult.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="37" REF="34">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marquis &s;eeing all hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Maria at an end, gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair. The &s;olitary life which he led, &s;erved only to in|crea&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion. Maria's image was ever pre&s;ent to his mind; and the day was &s;pent cur&s;ing his unhappy fate, born to honours which were the only &s;ource of his misfortunes,
<PB N="38" REF="35">
and of which he wi&s;hed it po&s;&s;ible to di|ve&s;t him&s;elf; whil&s;t the night was pa&s;|&s;ed in dreaming of his happier hours, which were now pa&s;t recovery fled.</P>
<P>Maria in the mean time had at|tempted, but in vain, to efface from her mind the impre&s;&s;ion which the Marquis had made on it: for not|with&s;tanding his ungenerous offer, &s;he loved him &s;till. Her friends re|marked with grief, that her former ferenity and cheerfulne&s;s were gone. She who was once the gaye&s;t on the green, now &s;at drooping at the &s;ide of a brook, that &s;eemed to &s;ympa|thi&s;e with her wo; whil&s;t the hills,
<PB N="39" REF="36">
which once re-echoed her happy &s;trains, heard nothing but &s;ighs.&mdash;Thus did Maria &s;pend each &s;ad revol|ving day; doomed to love, yet for|bid to hope, and con&s;cious that her birth was the only ob&s;tacle to her hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this &s;ituation when the Marchione&s;s made her appear|ance at the ca&s;tle; for the news of the Marquis's amour had reached Paris, with this embelli&s;hment, that he was &s;oon to be united to Maria. On her arrival, &s;he found the Mar|quis plunged in the deepe&s;t melan|choly. She urged him with the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="37">
vehemence to return to Paris. To this, however, he would by no means con&s;ent, but promi&s;ed to vi&s;it England: a country for which he entertained a high re&s;pect; e&s;teeming the Engli&s;h a free, a noble, and a generous people.&mdash;The Marchio|ne&s;s, on receiving her &s;on's promi&s;e to leave Clerville in a few days, left the ca&s;tle without mentioning Ma|ria, having learnt that there was no probability of his marrying her.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ooner was the Marchione&s;s gone, than the Marquis &s;et out for Dunkirk, without venturing to bid adieu to Maria. A few days landed him at Dover; whence he pro|ceeded to Canterbury; where, tho' no bigot, he vi&s;ited the &s;hrine of the mitred martyr. This ceremony per|formed, he &s;et out for the capital,
<PB N="42" REF="39">
where his rank introduced him to the be&s;t company; and in which, had he not been &s;unk in the deepe&s;t melan|choly, he would have &s;hone with lu&s;tre: But he was &s;o much altered by his misfortunes, that that wit which had rendered him the idol of Paris was bani&s;hed, and he always appeared as if he was any where but where he was.</P>
<P>In compliance, however, with his mother's commands, the Marquis &s;pent two years in England; during which time he vi&s;ited Bath, Wind|&s;or, the environs of London, and South Wales; where he was much
<PB N="43" REF="40">
&s;truck with the beautiful &s;cenery which every where pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his view. Scenes &s;o romantic did not fail to in&s;pire the Marquis with tho&s;e ideas which he endeavoured to bani&s;h from his mind. During his re&s;idence in England, he con&s;tantly corre&s;ponded with the Baron; who had his po&s;itive orders to &s;end an ac|count of Maria in every letter.</P>
<P>The time of his bani&s;hment being now expired, the Marquis &s;et out on his return to France; and a few days landed him at Clerville.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS he was riding one evening &s;oon after his arrival, he ob&s;er|ved a female figure reclined by the &s;ide of a brook. He immediately jumped off his hor&s;e; and having fa|&s;tened him to a tree, advanced gently to contemplate the fair unknown.&mdash;The trees that over&s;hadowed the brook prevented her from &s;eeing the
<PB N="45" REF="42">
Marquis; who, on a nearer approach, di&s;covered it to be his loved Ma|ria.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of Maria, the Marquis thought him&s;elf completely happy; for as &s;he had declared &s;he would ne|ver receive another vi&s;it from him, he had lo&s;t all hopes of &s;eeing her again. He threw him&s;elf at her feet; and eagerly &s;eizing her hand, ki&s;&s;ed it be|fore &s;he was &s;ufficiently recovered from her &s;urpri&s;e to di&s;cover who he was. No &s;ooner, however, was this di&s;covery made, than Maria &s;wooned. The Marquis &s;lew in an agony to get &s;ome water from the brook. He
<PB N="46" REF="43">
all means to re&s;tore her; but in vain for &s;ome time. At la&s;t, however, &s;he opened her eyes; and ca&s;ting them on the Marquis, fainted once more. Shocked at her relap&s;e, he &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s with grief and de&s;pair, till he was rouzed by the arrival of one of his &s;ervants; who, happening to pa&s;s that way, and ob&s;erving his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e, had entered the grove in &s;earch of him, dreading le&s;t he had met with &s;ome accident. The &s;er|vant was no &s;ooner perceived by the Marquis, than he was di&s;patched to the ca&s;tle for &s;alts, &amp;c. but with or|ders to mention to no one the &s;itua|tion in which he had found his ma|&s;ter.
<PB N="47" REF="44">
The Marquis in the mean time endeavoured, by throwing cold wa|ter on her face, to recover Maria; and he was fortunate enough to &s;uc|ceed: for when the &s;ervant returned, he found her &s;eated on a bank, recli|ning on his ma&s;ter's arm, but very weak.</P>
<P>Maria had no &s;ooner recovered from her &s;econd fainting-fit, than the Marquis intreated her to be compo|&s;ed; a&s;&s;uring her that no violence &s;hould ever be offered her by him. A little comforted by the&s;e a&s;&s;uran|ces, &s;he entered into conver&s;ation with him, de&s;iring him to permit her
<PB N="48" REF="45">
to return home, and to promi&s;e ne|ver to di&s;turb her retreat. For tho' &s;he was not happy there, nor ever could be any where, yet &s;he there en|joyed a &s;ort of repo&s;e, which his pre|&s;ence would infallibly de&s;troy. She owned that &s;he had a great regard for him; a regard which would pre|vent her from ever being any one's but his. But as &s;he never could be his con&s;i&s;tently with her honour, &s;he was determined never to be his at all. Her happine&s;s was a &s;acrifice &s;he had not with-held; but her honour &s;hould ever remain &s;acred and inviolate.</P>
<P>The Marquis begged pardon for the
<PB N="49" REF="46">
offers he had made her through her aunt, and pleaded in excu&s;e the ex|ce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion; ob&s;erving, that the fooli&s;h maxims of the age in which they lived, had placed in&s;upe|rable ob&s;tacles between them and hap|pine&s;s. He a&s;&s;ured her, that it now gave him the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, to think that &s;he had treated his offers as they de&s;erved; and concluded with promi&s;ing never more to make at|tempts of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>Maria was by this time &s;ufficiently recovered to think of returning home: and accordingly, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Marquis, &s;he reached the dairy;
<PB N="50" REF="47">
the &s;cene of happy hours that were no more to return, and on which they reflected with plea&s;ure mixed with regret. Here Maria bid adieu to the Marquis, &s;trictly forbidding him to vi&s;it her on any pretence whatever, and returned to the cottage; where her pre&s;ence occa&s;ioned as much joy as had her ab&s;ence unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>THE Marquis, in the mean time, returned to Clerville more en|amoured than ever; and determined, that, as he could not confer the title of Marchione&s;s of Clerville on Maria, no other woman ever &s;hould enjoy it. As &s;oon as he found him&s;elf at the ca&s;tle, he retired to his dre&s;&s;ing|room, that he might be at lei&s;ure to
<PB N="52" REF="49">
indulge tho&s;e melancholy reflections that engro&s;&s;ed his mind. Here he &s;at meditating on his unhappy fate till midnight, when he was alarmed by the horn of an expre&s;s who rode into the court-yard. He immediately flew down; and &s;natching the letter from the bearer, opened it with the utmo&s;t anxiety. He no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes on the writing, than he knew it to be the Baron's, who reque&s;ted his immediate pre&s;ence at Paris on bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance. With this reque&s;t the Marquis he&s;itated not to comply; and three days after, he reached the capital.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="50">
On his arrival, the Baron informed him, that an uncle of his had died at Li&s;bon, and had left him a con&s;ider|able property; of which, however, he could not take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion but in per|&s;on; and he reque&s;ted the Marquis to accompany him thither. The Marquis wi&s;hed not to comply: at the &s;ame time, he could not refu&s;e any thing to the Baron; and &s;o he at length determined to bid adieu to Clerville ca&s;tle and to Maria for a few months.</P>
<P>Before he embarked, however, he wrote to Maria, regretting his being obliged to leave Clerville: For tho'
<PB N="54" REF="51">
he could not &s;ee her, as &s;he had not yet con&s;ented to receive his vi&s;its, he had the plea&s;ure of hearing of her every day. Of this plea&s;ure, how|ever, he was now to be deprived; and in a few days the two friends em|barked for Portugal.</P>

<P>THEIR voyage was pro&s;perous till they were within a few days fail of their de&s;tined port, when one morn|ing an Algerine cor&s;air was di&s;cover|ed bearing down upon them. The appearance of this worthy follower of Mahomet excited very di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations in the brea&s;ts of the crew, as their ve&s;&s;el was of force con&s;ider|ably
<PB N="56" REF="53">
inferior to that of the Cor&s;air. He was now, however, too near to admit of their e&s;caping; they there|fore determined to &s;ell their lives or their liberties dearly. The Marquis, though a &s;oldier, had never &s;een &s;er|vice. He embraced with ardour this opportunity of &s;howing that he had not re&s;igned his &s;word becau&s;e he knew not how to u&s;e it. A few mi|nutes brought them clo&s;e to each other, and a mutual di&s;charge of broad&s;ides took place. The action continued for twenty minutes, when the Marquis ordered out the grap|pling irons, and united the Cor&s;air
<PB N="57" REF="54">
to them by ties of not a very ductile nature. His ardour increa&s;ing every minute, he at la&s;t determined to board them. In this bold attempt he &s;ucceeded, and found him&s;elf in an in&s;tant on the deck of the Cor&s;air. Several of the crew attempted to fol|low the example of the Marquis, but peri&s;hed in the attempt. Some few &s;ucceeded, but were &s;oon &s;acrificed to the rage of the enemy; who find|ing them&s;elves boarded, fought with the utmo&s;t fury. The Marquis, how|ever, had penetrated unhurt into the middle of the deck, where he was made pri&s;oner; as the aim of the
<PB N="58" REF="55">
Algerine crui&s;ers is always to take as many pri&s;oners as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant the Cor&s;air lo&s;t her main-ma&s;t and con&s;iderable part of her rigging. This being ob&s;erved by the French, they quickly made off, notwith&s;tanding the threats and in|treaties of the Baron, who was wound|ed in attempting to follow his friend, and now &s;at upon the deck in a chair, to &s;ee if any thing could be done to re&s;cue him. But the French being &s;atisfied with the reception they had already met with, did not choo&s;e to hazard the event of a &s;econd en|gagement; and a fre&s;h gale &s;pring|ing

<P>THE Baron &s;till &s;at on the deck, beholding, with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, the pri&s;on of his friend; a pri&s;on into which he had been led by his friend&s;hip for him. While he was indulging tho&s;e melancholy reflec|tions, his wound had bled &s;o much that he was quite faint: but, faint as he was, he ordered out the pinnace,
<PB N="61" REF="58">
and determined to go and &s;hare the fortune of his friend. But not one of the crew would undertake to man it, expecting that as &s;oon as they &s;hould come within reach of the Cor|&s;air's guns they &s;hould all peri&s;h.&mdash;The Baron finding that neither threats nor intreaties would prevail on the crew to row him to the Cor&s;air, gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair. He was now &s;o weakened by his wound, that this new agitation threw him into a faint|ing fit; during which his &s;ervant, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the crew, carried him to the cabin; where the &s;urgeon dre&s;&s;ed his wound, and put him to bed. He &s;lept for &s;ome hours; but
<PB N="62" REF="59">
no &s;ooner awoke than it was evident he was delirious. He called on the Marquis; he offered to beggar him|&s;elf to procure his ran&s;om; and a&s;ked pardon of Maria for having deprived her of her Clerville.</P>
<P>In this manner he continued ra|ving for &s;ome hours. At length he fell a&s;leep; and having taken a com|po&s;ing draught, &s;lept &s;ound for &s;ome time. When he awoke he &s;eemed much better, and was &s;oon able to &s;it on the deck for the benefit of air. The winds had proved contrary ever &s;ince they had parted with the Cor|&s;air; but they were now favourable,
<PB N="63" REF="60">
and a few days landed the Baron in Li&s;bon; where his fir&s;t employment was to prepare for a voyage to Al|giers, which he determined to under|take as &s;oon as the &s;tate of his wound would permit him.</P>

<P>THE wi&s;hed-for hour at length came, and the Baron embarked for Algiers; where he arrived &s;afe after a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age. He thought, that if he was once landed he &s;hould have very little difficulty to procure the freedom of his friend, having brought an immen&s;e &s;um with him for that purpo&s;e. In this, however,
<PB N="65" REF="62">
he was di&s;appointed: for on his ar|rival at Algiers, he found that the captain of the Cor&s;air had &s;old his friend to he did not know whom. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t degree at this melancholy piece of intelligence, he inquired how long he had been &s;old. They informed him, &s;ome weeks; and that he was gone far up into the coun|try, but to what place they did not know. In this dilemma he determi|ned to &s;et out in &s;earch of his friend; having procured an order from the Dey that he &s;hould be delivered up to him, on paying the price which had been paid to the captain.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="63">
For a long while his &s;earches were un&s;ucce&s;sful: but after having expe|rienced nothing but di&s;appointment for &s;even months, he at la&s;t found the Marquis employed as a gardener in a retired part of the country. To attempt a de&s;cription of the feelings of the&s;e two friends on this joyful meeting, would be &s;uperfluous; and to execute &s;uch a de&s;cription, would be impracticable. I &s;hall therefore ha|&s;ten to inform the reader of what happened to the Marquis after he was taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>His treatment on board was not &s;o har&s;h as might have been expected;
<PB N="67" REF="64">
and the Cor&s;air's being much dama|ged put an early period to his con|finement, as the captain made for Algiers with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. His fir&s;t care, on his arrival, was to di&s;|po&s;e of the Marquis, le&s;t the Dey &s;hould put in his claim. The per&s;on who bought him re&s;ided in the mo&s;t remote part of the country; and find|ing him a good gardener (that ha|ving been one of the Marquis's amu&s;e|ments at Clerville), he committed to him the care of his garden. This tru&s;t the Marquis executed with &s;o much fidelity and ability, that he &s;oon became a great favourite with his new ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="65">
The old Mahometan was walking in his garden when the Baron en|tered. The Marquis and he flew in|to one another's arms; in which &s;i|tuation they remained for &s;ome mo|ments, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the mu&s;&s;ulman. At la&s;t, however, ad|vancing towards them, he received from the Baron the Dey's order for the liberty of the Marquis. He read it over two or three times with at|tention, as it contained a &s;hort ac|count of the Marquis's misfortunes. He then returned it, a&s;&s;uring them by their interpreter that it was totally u&s;ele&s;s; for that from that time the Marquis was his own ma&s;ter; but on
<PB N="69" REF="66">
one condition only, that he did not offer to pay for his liberty.</P>
<P>The two friends looked at each other with a&s;toni&s;hment. At length the Marquis broke &s;ilence; decla|ring, that if the&s;e were the only terms on which he could procure his freedom, he would end his days in &s;lavery. An intere&s;ting conte&s;t en|&s;ued between the Marquis and his ma&s;ter; in which the former at la&s;t proved victorious, and the generous Mahometan was con&s;trained to ac|cept of a thou&s;and pounds as an equivalent for the Marquis's free|dom,
<PB N="70" REF="67">
&mdash;a &s;um much greater than what he had given for him.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of the Turk, they deferred their departure for &s;ome days; during which time they wrote to France, informing their friends of the joyful event that had taken place. The hour at length arrived when they were to bid adieu to the gene|rous Mahometan; who, whatever his religious principles were, would have done honour to any religion. He embraced them at parting; and earne&s;tly recommending them to the protection of the prophet, bade them farewell. The Marquis could not
<PB N="71" REF="68">
refrain from tears, at leaving a man who&s;e conduct towards him had been &s;o noble and di&s;intere&s;ted. He bid adieu to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, with feelings not common on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion; and could he have forgotten his loved Maria, he would have felt &s;till more than he did at quitting the generous Mahometan.</P>

<P>THE two friends in a few days arrived at Algiers, whence the Marquis in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ailing to Li&s;|bon before they returned to France; declaring, that as the Baron had &s;a|crificed his own intere&s;ts to his hap|pine&s;s, he mu&s;t now accompany him to &s;ettle them. To this the Baron with reluctance con&s;ented; and the
<PB N="73" REF="70">
day for &s;ailing was fixed, when one evening as the Marquis and he were at &s;upper, a number of armed men &s;uddenly entered, and &s;eizing the Marquis, carried him off, notwith|&s;tanding all the re&s;i&s;tance the Baron could make.</P>
<P>Both the one and the other know|ing the violences that are daily com|mitted under that government, de|&s;paired of ever meeting more. But Clerville was doomed to &s;uffer un|numbered woes ere death &s;hould &s;ign his relea&s;e. He found him&s;elf con|veyed to a large hou&s;e about three miles from the town, which had all
<PB N="74" REF="71">
the appearance of a palace. Here he pa&s;&s;ed the night; and it would be &s;u|perfluous to add, a &s;leeple&s;s one. The morning having made its appearance, he looked out of his windows, and beheld him&s;elf &s;ituated in a delight|ful garden, which Nature &s;eemed to have formed in &s;ome lavi&s;h hour. Nor had art been le&s;s liberal. It was all perfection; and appeared calcula|ted for the abode of love and peace, if ever they had cho&s;en to re&s;ide to|gether.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Marquis was reflecting on his own &s;ituation, he was inter|rupted by the appearance of a female
<PB N="75" REF="72">
&s;lave, who acco&s;ting him in the lan|guage of the country, de&s;ired him to bani&s;h fear; for that he had been &s;ei|zed only to be conducted to bli&s;s: That a beautiful young widow had &s;een him as he pa&s;&s;ed the window the other day; and was &s;o much &s;truck with him, that &s;he determined to con|fer on him, her&s;elf and all her im|men&s;e riches: that as &s;oon as he had dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the Turki&s;h habit he was to repair to her, and that &s;he would be his conductre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Marquis determined to obey immediately; and having dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in a dre&s;s which was brought him
<PB N="76" REF="73">
by the &s;lave, he followed her into a large room, at the upper end of which he beheld, &s;eated on a &s;ofa, a fine female figure, mo&s;t richly adorned. She advanced a few &s;teps to meet him; and having &s;aluted him in the manner of the country, &s;he &s;eated him by her&s;elf on the &s;ofa, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P><Q>Chri&s;tian, my &s;lave has already informed you where I fir&s;t &s;aw you, and how much I was &s;truck with your appearance. If your mind be as beautiful as your per&s;on, I &s;hall have no rea&s;on to repent the &s;tep I have taken. Should that prove the
<PB N="77" REF="74">
ca&s;e, I will render your life com|pletely happy. If, on the other hand, I &s;hall have rea&s;on to regret my con|duct towards you, expect to feel the effects of my vengeance. On the death of my hu&s;band, I determined to become a Chri&s;tian, and to marry one of your faith; as with you the women are treated like women, and not like &s;laves; and one man is not, as I am told, allowed to have more than one wife. The&s;e rea&s;ons deter|mined me to marry a Chri&s;tian; and as I am much plea&s;ed with your ap|pearance, I will confer upon you my riches and my per&s;on. I have learn|ed from your attendants that you are
<PB N="78" REF="75">
not married; I therefore doubt not of your accepting my offer. There remains then nothing for us to do, but to celebrate the marriage accord|ing to your rites; and then we will embark for your country with my trea&s;ure, which will enable you to live in &s;plendor and magnificence.</Q></P>
<P>To this addre&s;s the Marquis li&s;ten|ed with the utmo&s;t attention, but was perfectly at a lo&s;s how to reply. At la&s;t, however, after having pau&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time, he an&s;wered in the following terms:</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="76">
<Q REND="inline">I am &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;tingui&s;hed honour you intend me, when you &s;e|lect me to be the partner of your riches and your bed. It is with re|luctance I deline an honour &s;o flat|tering and &s;o enviable: but vows which I have made,&mdash;vows of a mo&s;t &s;olemn nature,&mdash;vows that mu&s;t for ever remain &s;acred and inviolate&mdash;render it impo&s;&s;ible for me to accept that happine&s;s which you &s;o generou&s;ly offer. I &s;hall, however, remember with gratitude, and reflect with re|gret, on this day's adventure. I am &s;orry that my attachment to one who is now far di&s;tant, and who counts with anxiety the hours that inter|vene
<PB N="80" REF="77">
between this time and that of my expected return, precludes me from returning that affection you pro|fe&s;s for me. It is true we are not united by the rites of our faith; nay, we never may be &s;o: but we have exchanged the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows, if we do not marry each other, never to marry at all. From the&s;e mo&s;t &s;acred obligations, no power what|ever can relea&s;e me. You mu&s;t not therefore do me the inju&s;tice to at|tribute my refu&s;al of your offer to in|&s;en&s;ibility of your uncommon charms, but to the violence of an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, which will, I fear, one day prove my ruin.</Q></P>

During the Marquis's di&s;cour&s;e, Zara's eyes fla&s;hed fire; but when he had concluded it, &s;he gave no bounds to her re&s;entment. She felt her&s;elf injured, if not in&s;ulted, by this pre|ference given to another; and deter|mined from that in&s;tant to effect the ruin of the Marquis. He was by her &s;laves reconducted to his pri&s;on, where he waited with fortitude the event of a tran&s;action from which he had every thing to dread: for the Marquis well knew, that nothing is &s;o dangerous as a &s;lighted female.</P>
<P>He had not, however, been long in his confinement, before the Baron en|tered
<PB N="82" REF="79">
his apartment, and once more re&s;tored him to freedom. For, ha|ving obtained an order from the Dey for that purpo&s;e, he ea&s;ily di&s;covered the pri&s;on of his friend; and in a few minutes conducted him to the har|bour, where they embarked for Li&s;|bon; well knowing they had every thing to fear from the re&s;entment of Zara. After a good pa&s;&s;age, they landed in Portugal; where the Mar|quis found letters from all his friends, congratulating him on the recovery of his liberty. But the&s;e letters pro|ved un&s;atisfactory. They contained not the name of Maria; for whom his attachment was as great as ever,

<P>AFTER the Marquis's depart|ture, Maria relap&s;ed into her former melancholy. She generally &s;pent the whole day on that &s;pot which had witne&s;&s;ed the affecting interview between her and her lover, and which has been already de&s;cribed. Heaven, however, commi&s;erating her &s;orrows, &s;ent to her relief one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="82">
amiable women that ever lived. A|delaide now made her appearance at the cottage. As her hi&s;tory is &s;ome|thing &s;ingular, and as &s;he was the friend of Maria, the reader will, I hope, pardon my in&s;erting a &s;hort ac|count of it.</P>
<P>Adelaide was the only daughter of the Baron and Barone&s;s D'Aranda. Her father and mother lived in the greate&s;t &s;plendor and magnificence; and by the time Adelaide had reach|ed the age of &s;ixteen, found them|&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated to quit Paris, and retire to the family-feat at Cler|mont.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="83">
The Baron, to add to the many other bad qualities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was a game&s;ter; and &s;ome unlucky hit had almo&s;t ruined his affairs. The man who retires from the world only be|cau&s;e he can no longer afford to live in it, after he has ruined him&s;elf by vice, does not generally make the mo&s;t agreeable companion, becau&s;e he is never happy in him&s;elf&mdash;It is to the good man only that retirement is plea&s;ant. With &s;uch a companion as the Baron, however, was Adelaide doomed to &s;pend her days when in the bloom of life; &s;he was &s;uddenly torn from the admiration of Paris, and the friends of her youth, to lin|ger
<PB N="87" REF="84">
in a gloomy &s;olitude. But this &s;he could have borne, had it been the only &s;ource of her unhappine&s;s. But her father's temper, ever bad, was now &s;o &s;oured by his recent lo&s;&s;es, that he vented his &s;pleen on every one who came in his way.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s, his wife, was a mild amiable woman, who endeavoured to &s;often her own lot and that of her daughter, but to no purpo&s;e. The Baron was continually cur&s;ing that bad luck which had reduced him to his pre&s;ent unhappy &s;tate; and, in|&s;tead of being cured of his pa&s;&s;ion for gaming, he was con&s;tantly expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="88" REF="85">
his ardent wi&s;hes that he might &s;oon be in a condition to take the field once more.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had arrived at Clermont, the Barone&s;s and her daughter u&s;ed every means to render the Baron's life as plea&s;ant as po&s;|&s;ible. They invented little amu&s;e|ments for him; and tried, but in vain, to make him reli&s;h his new &s;i|tuation. He grew more moro&s;e than ever; and they remained &s;till un|happy.</P>
<P>Matters had continued in this &s;tate
<PB N="89" REF="86">
for near a year, when the Barone&s;s was taken ill. She found that &s;he was dying; and having &s;ent for A|delaide, &s;he gave her her will, in which &s;he had left her all &s;he had to di&s;po&s;e of, <HI>viz.</HI> three thou&s;and livres a-year; appointing her cou&s;in Mon|&s;ieur de V&acirc;tres her guardian. With tears in her eyes, &s;he recommended it to her to live with her father as long as &s;he could, and to do every thing in order to plea&s;e him. At the &s;ame time &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">If you find your&s;elf obliged to leave him, which I fear will &s;oon be the ca&s;e, retire to Mr de V&acirc;rtes, who will protect you;
<PB N="90" REF="87">

<P>She had &s;carce fini&s;hed this di&s;|cour&s;e, when the Baron entered the room. He was ju&s;t returned from a card-table at the next town, to which he went as often as he had money, in hopes of repairing his fortunes by &s;ome lucky &s;troke.

<P>ADELAIDE, upon the death of her mother, was &s;o much af|flicted, that &s;he was thrown into a vio|lent fever, and confined to her cham|ber for &s;even weeks.

had made was now totally effaced from his mind. He informed his daughter of his intention to marry her to the Duc d'Albeville, an old worn-out rake; and required her con&s;ent.

With this reque&s;t Mr de V&acirc;tres complied, and placed her with Maria's father, who was a tenant of his.

<P>AFFAIRS were in this &s;ituation when the Marquis and his friend returned from Li&s;bon. Im|mediately on his landing, he flew to Clerville. He was no &s;ooner there, than he repaired to the con&s;cious grove. But&mdash;ah&mdash;there was no Ma|ria there! To the cottage he dur&s;t not go till he had obtained her leave:
<PB N="98" REF="95">
For that leave he applied; but it was ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed. He petitioned for an interview; but to no purpo&s;e. De&s;pairing of ever &s;eeing her more, he returned to Clerville, where he was &s;eized with a fever, which la&s;ted thirty days; during which time the Baron never left his bed-&s;ide. When delirious, he called his Maria cruel; and begged her to vi&s;it him. Some|times he lamented her death, and &s;ometimes prayed heaven to accele|rate his own. The phy&s;icians, how|ever, at la&s;t gave the Baron hopes of his friend's recovery; and a few days verified their prediction. The Mar|quis's fever gradually abating, he
<PB N="99" REF="96">
&s;oon found him&s;elf able to walk in the park; but he was &s;till &s;o dejected, that the Baron feared, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;tep was taken for bani&s;hing his me|lancholy, he would &s;oon fall a victim to it.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Baron had entertained pre|judices again&s;t the Marquis's marrying Maria: but he was a&s;ha|med to think of &s;acrificing his friend to his prejudices; and well knowing that de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;pe|rate remedies, he propo&s;ed him&s;elf, that the Marquis &s;hould apply for his mother's con&s;ent to the marriage.
<PB N="101" REF="98">
He undertook to convey the Mar|quis's reque&s;t to the Marchione&s;s; and to a&s;&s;ure her, that nothing &s;hort of her con&s;ent could pre&s;erve the life of her &s;on.</P>
<P>To this propo&s;al the Marquis li|&s;tened with ec&s;ta&s;y. He had often de|termined within him&s;elf to marry Ma|ria; but he feared that even the Ba|ron would not &s;upport him in &s;o im|prudent a choice. No time, how|ever, was now to be lo&s;t; and the Baron &s;et out for Paris, leaving to his friend the delightful office of in|forming Maria of the &s;tep taken in her favour.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="99">
This office the Marquis &s;oon di&s;|charged. He flew to the cottage, ru&s;hed into her chamber, threw him|&s;elf at her feet, and vowed never to ri&s;e till &s;he promi&s;ed to ble&s;s him with her hand, provided he &s;hould obtain his mother's con&s;ent. The old peo|ple, who had followed him to the room, did not leave their daughter time to reply. They declared, that if the Marquis was in earne&s;t, he was the be&s;t, the mo&s;t generous of men. Maria &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s. Adelaide, who had never before &s;een the Mar|quis, was not at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s who he was, and expected with impa|tience the reply of her friend. Ma|ria,
<PB N="103" REF="100">
after recovering a little, a&s;&s;ured the Marquis that he was going to take a &s;tep of which he would re|pent when it was too late; but that &s;ince he declared his happine&s;s de|pended on her becoming his, &s;he &s;hould defer accepting the honour he now offered her, only till he &s;hould receive the Marchione&s;s's approba|tion.</P>
<P>Maria had no &s;ooner given her con&s;ent than the Marquis aro&s;e; and, &s;eating him&s;elf by her, reproached her for her cruelty in refu&s;ing to &s;ee him: but before &s;he could ju&s;tify her&s;elf, &s;he fainted, quite overcome
<PB N="104" REF="101">
with the &s;cene which had happened. Adelaide flew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her friend; and in a &s;hort time Maria recovered.</P>
<P>The Marquis, who till then had not ob&s;erved Adelaide, his attention having been wholly engro&s;&s;ed by Ma|ria, now turning to the former, ad|dre&s;&s;ed her in the following man|ner:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Madam, as you are the intimate friend of Maria, and are well ac|quainted with her misfortunes as well as with mine; my conduct will leave you no room to doubt that I am the
<PB N="105" REF="102">
unfortunate Marquis of Clerville. Permit me to embrace this opportu|nity of thanking you for your good|ne&s;s to Maria; for which I &s;hall be ever grateful. I have long wi&s;hed to commence an acquaintance with you; but Maria's injunctions forbidding me to vi&s;it her, has prevented it till now. I tru&s;t you will not refu&s;e me either your friend&s;hip or your pity.</Q> To this &s;peech Adelaide could make no reply, &s;he was &s;o much confu&s;ed; but after a little while &s;he retired and left the two lovers alone. The Mar|quis intreated Maria to delay her hap|pine&s;s no longer than the return of the Baron, whom he expected in a
<PB N="106" REF="103">
few days. With this reque&s;t &s;he pro|mi&s;ed to comply; and it being late, the Marquis, having bid adieu to Ma|ria, returned home to prepare the ca&s;tle for her reception.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>AT length the wi&s;hed-for hour arrived, when the Baron made his appearance at the ca&s;tle. The Marquis flew to meet him, and read his fate in the Baron's countenance; who delivered to him a letter from the Marchione&s;s, containing a po&s;i|tive refu&s;al of her con&s;ent, and a de|claration that &s;he would &s;ooner fol|low
<PB N="108" REF="105">
him to the grave than &s;ee him di&s;|grace him&s;elf by &s;o degrading a con|nection as that he now wi&s;hed to make.</P>
<P>This news had near proved fatal to the Marquis. After, however, ha|ving meditated for &s;ome time, he went to Maria; informed her of his mother's determination; but decla|red, that as &s;oon as ever the marriage &s;ettlements could be drawn up, he would marry her, be the con&s;equences what they would: That, as to the lo&s;s of his mother's e&s;tate, he &s;hould never feel it; for however &s;mall his own fortune might be, it was &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="109" REF="106">
for them. He had too good an opinion of her under&s;tanding, to &s;up|po&s;e that &s;he was ambitious of mo|ving in a higher &s;phere; that for his own part, he &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment to &s;ink into a lower one, provided he could but call her his.</P>
<P>Maria affected to be delighted with the thoughts of her approaching nup|tials. But no &s;ooner was the Mar|quis gone, than &s;he applied to her fa|ther for leave to go for two days to her uncle's, who lived at a few miles di&s;tance. This leave being obtained, &s;he &s;et out; but, in&s;tead of going to
<PB N="110" REF="107">
her uncle's, directed her &s;teps to a convent; the &s;afe&s;t retreat of the un|fortunate. It was &s;eventy miles from Clerville. There &s;he had a friend, through who&s;e intere&s;t &s;he was recei|ved by the Abbe&s;s, who approved of her intention of taking the veil, and promi&s;ed &s;he &s;hould be concealed there till it &s;hould be out of the power of man to take her thence. Being now &s;afe from all pur&s;uit, &s;he wrote the following letter to the Marquis:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

I &s;hould ill de&s;erve the affection of the Marquis of Clerville, if I could accept the generous offer you made me in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion.

<P>THE Marquis no &s;ooner received her letter than he flew to the cottage. The fir&s;t per&s;on he met was Adelaide, who was in tears for the lo&s;s of her friend. She endeavour|ed to comfort the Marquis, but to no purpo&s;e. He inquired for Maria's father; who no &s;ooner appeared, than he taxed him with being privy to his
<PB N="115" REF="112">
daughter's elopement. The old man replied only by crying, and tearing his hair, and cur&s;ing his fate in ha|ving a daughter who rejected ho|nour, and wealth, and happine&s;s, for the &s;ake of burying her&s;elf in a con|vent.</P>
<P>The Marquis finding that none of her letters were dated, vowed to &s;et out the next day in &s;earch of her. From this the Baron attempted to di&s;&s;uade him: but finding him determined to go, he re&s;olved at la&s;t to ac|company him on his journey; and the next day they &s;et out. Almo&s;t every convent in France was &s;earch|ed,
<PB N="116" REF="113">
but to no purpo&s;e. The Mar|quis's health was declining very fa&s;t, owing to the con&s;tant fatigues he un|derwent, and to the agitation of his &s;pirits. He continued his pur&s;uit, however, for near a year; during which time he had not been able to procure any intelligence of Maria. She con&s;tantly corre&s;ponded with A|delaide, who alone knew where &s;he was hid. This corre&s;pondence, in the end, proved the means of her re|&s;idence being di&s;covered by the Mar|quis.</P>
<P>Maria, hearing from Adelaide that the Marquis &s;till continued his pur|&s;uit,

wrote him the following let|ter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>THE Marquis received this letter late at night. He peru&s;ed it &s;everal times; and then retired to his room, where he continued walking up and down till morning in great agitation. As &s;oon as the Baron was up, he de&s;ired him to &s;et out and follow him, without informing him where they were going. After tra|velling
<PB N="120" REF="117">
a few miles, he &s;topped at a &s;mall inn, finding him&s;elf &s;o weak that he could proceed no farther. Here they breakfa&s;ted; and ju&s;t after breakfa&s;t &s;tepped into the kitchen, where the po&s;t was delivering out the letters for that di&s;trict. As he was thus employed, the Marquis ob&s;er|ved one directed by a well-known hand. He in&s;tantly &s;eized it; and before the po&s;t could prevent him, he broke it open. It proved to be from Maria to Adelaide; informing her, that on that very day &s;he was to take the veil, in a convent only &s;ix miles di&s;tant from where the Marquis then was. The Marquis threw down
<PB N="121" REF="118">
the letter; and running into the &s;table, &s;eized his hor&s;e, and &s;et out full &s;peed for the convent. The Ba|ron, who had caught up the letter, and perceived the contents, imme|diately followed him; and they pro|ceeded together to the convent.</P>
<P>When they entered the chapel, the ceremony was begun. The Baron trembled at the &s;ight; but the Mar|quis &s;eemed to acquire new &s;ortitude, and waited with heroic firmne&s;s the conclu&s;ion of the &s;atal rite. But no &s;ooner was it over, and Maria pre|paring to withdraw, than, exclaim|ing with agony, <Q REND="inline">Cruel Maria!</Q> he
<PB N="122" REF="119">
&s;unk motionle&s;s into the arms of the Baron, and expired.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion that &s;o melancholy an event occa&s;ioned in the chapel, attracted the eyes of every one. Ma|ria no &s;ooner ca&s;t her eyes on the fa|tal &s;pot where the Marquis lay, than &s;he &s;unk &s;peechle&s;s into the arms of tho&s;e who &s;tood next her. She was immediately conveyed into the con|vent; where &s;he remained in&s;en&s;ible for &s;ome time: But when &s;he was re|covered, they found that &s;he had lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es. She raved; and, addre&s;|&s;ing her&s;elf to the Marquis, promi&s;ed to marry him immediately; then a&s;k|ed
<PB N="123" REF="120">
his pardon for occa&s;ioning his death. In this &s;tate &s;he remained till evening, when &s;he was conveyed to bed, where &s;he got little &s;leep, and that very di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>The Baron, in the mean time, had conveyed the Marquis's body to a neighbouring hou&s;e; where all at|tempts to re&s;tore him to life proved ineffectual. The Baron was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and knew not what to do. Next day, however, he repaired to the convent (having, in the mean time, di&s;patched an expre&s;s to A|delaide, de&s;iring her immediate pre|&s;ence), and endeavoured to &s;ee Ma|ria.
<PB N="124" REF="121">
But &s;he was not in a condition to be &s;een by any one, for &s;he was &s;till delirious.</P>
<P>In this condition did the Baron remain till Adelaide's arrival. The meeting between them was &s;uch as one would expect between two peo|ple &s;o circum&s;tanced. After &s;ome conver&s;ation, the Baron and Adelaide repaired to the convent, where Ade|laide gained admi&s;&s;ion to her &s;till de|lirious friend. Maria did not take the lea&s;t notice of Adelaide, but con|tinued &s;till to addre&s;s her conver&s;a|tion to the Marquis. This melan|choly &s;pectacle proved too much for
<PB N="125" REF="122">
Adelaide. She was obliged to return to the inn, where &s;he found the Ba|ron preparing to accompany the re|mains of the amiable and unfortunate Marquis of Clerville to his &s;eat, where he was to be interred.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>ON his arrival at Clerville, the Baron found the Marchione&s;s walking in the Park, waiting the re|turn of her &s;on, who &s;he heard was expected at home that day. She no &s;ooner beheld the mournful caval|cade, and learned the fate of her a|miable &s;on, than &s;he bur&s;t into tears. The Baron proceeded to the hall,
<PB N="127" REF="124">
where he lodged the remains of his friend. They were no &s;ooner in the hall, than &s;urrounded by all his weeping dome&s;tics, who declared that they never could meet with &s;o kind a ma&s;ter. The Baron begged them to be comforted; a&s;&s;ured them he would retain every one of them in his &s;ervice as long as they plea&s;ed, and would endeavour to imitate the conduct of their late worthy ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s &s;ent for the Ba|ron to her room, and inquired the particulars of her &s;on's death. She &s;aid, that though &s;he could not but lament his fate, &s;he was happy he
<PB N="128" REF="125">
had not lived to di&s;grace his illu&s;tri|ous ance&s;tors. The Baron left her, incen&s;ed to the la&s;t degree by &s;o un|feeling a &s;peech, and prepared to ful|fil a promi&s;e he had made to his friend; which was to &s;end his heart inclo&s;ed in a &s;ilver urn to Maria. He accordingly &s;et out for the convent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>ON his arrival he found Maria &s;till delirious, but with lucid intervals. Adelaide, who during the Baron's ab&s;ence had re&s;ided in the convent, gave him hopes of her recovery. But the&s;e hopes &s;oon va|ni&s;hed. For no &s;ooner did Maria receive from the Baron the melan|choly legacy, than &s;he became wor&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="127">
than ever; and &s;natching up the urn, ran to the &s;oot of the altar, whence &s;he would &s;uffer none to remove her, but &s;pent the whole night in weeping over that heart which was her's in every &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>In the morning &s;he &s;uffered Ade|laide to lead her to her apartment, whence &s;he never &s;tirred for &s;ome weeks. The Baron in the mean time returned to Clerville; where, af|ter having celebrated the funeral of his friend, he proceeded to execute his will; in which he had left the e|&s;tate of Clerville to the Baron, &s;ub|ject to a pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and
<PB N="131" REF="128">
livres to Maria, and five hundred to each of her parents.</P>
<P>This affair being &s;ettled, he once more &s;et out for the convent. On his arrival, Maria appeared at the grate with her friend, which till now &s;he had not done &s;ince &s;he had re|ceived the fatal pre&s;ent. The meet|ing was affecting in the highe&s;t de|gree. The Baron and Adelaide wept in &s;ilence. Maria continued &s;till to rave, and addre&s;s her&s;elf to the Mar|quis. The Baron could bear this in|terview no longer; but retired from the grate, leaving Adelaide to con|duct her friend back to her apart|ment.
<PB N="132" REF="129">
At two in the morning Ma|ria aro&s;e, and taking with her the urn, repaired to the chapel, where &s;he continued weeping, till Adelaide wa|king, and mi&s;&s;ing her, went to the chapel in &s;earch of her, and with dif|ficulty prevailed on her to return.</P>
<P>Maria continued in this &s;tate for &s;ome time; but at length &s;he chan|ged her manner, and never &s;poke at all, but remained in a deep and fixed melancholy. She was now &s;o much emaciated by her con&s;tant grief, that the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of her life: But, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of every one, &s;he continued in this &s;ituation
<PB N="133" REF="130">
for two years; during which time Adelaide never left the convent. At the end of this time &s;he became &s;o feeble, that Adelaide, &s;eeing her di&s;|&s;olution approaching, &s;ent for the Baron. On his arrival Maria ap|peared at the grate, &s;upported by A|delaide and two nuns. She was now &s;o altered, that the Baron hardly knew her. He attempted to &s;peak to her; but was &s;o much affected, that he could not. She made &s;igns for them to bring her a chair, on which &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf; and, re&s;ting her hand on the urn, a&s;ked him if that con|tained her Clerville's heart. To this the Baron an&s;wered in the affirma|tive;
<PB N="134" REF="131">
on which &s;he exclaimed, Cler|ville is dead! and, &s;inking into the arms of Adelaide, cea&s;ed to &s;igh.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the feel|ings of the &s;pectators. Adelaide threw her&s;elf on the corp&s;e, and be|dewed it with her tears. The Ba|ron retired to the inn to give vent to his grief, whence he &s;tirred not till next day. He then waited on the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e and the lady abbe&s;s of the convent, who both con|&s;ented to his reque&s;t, and permitted him to remove Maria's body to Cler|ville, where it was interred in the &s;ame grave with that of her unfortu|nate
