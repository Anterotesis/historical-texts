<P>Right Jack, we'll argue in Platoons.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, let him have our grievances in a vol|ly,

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let me alone for that, I &s;erv'd three years wi|thin
a bit, under his honour, in the Royal Inni&s;killions,
and I never will &s;ee a &s;weeter tempered gentleman, nor
one more free with his pur&s;e. I put a great &s;hamrogue
in his hat this morning, and I'll be bound for him, he'll
wear it, was it as big as Steven's green.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4th Sol</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay again then you talk like young&s;ters,
like Militia &s;triplings, there is a di&s;cipline, look'ee, in
all things, whereof the &s;erjeant mu&s;t be our guide, he's
a gentleman of words, he under&s;tands your foreign lingo,
your figures, and &s;uch like auxiliaries in &s;coring.&mdash;Con|fe&s;s
now for a reckoning, whether in chalk or writing,
ben't he your only man.</P>

<P>Good &s;oldiers, and fellow gentlemen, if you

<P>So then, to order.&mdash;Put on your mutiny looks,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ahem! hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>So plea&s;e your honour, the very grievance of
the matter is this;&mdash;ever &s;ince your honour differed with
Ju&s;tice Credilous, our Inkeepers u&s;e us mo&s;t &s;curvily.&mdash;
By my halbert, their treatment is &s;uch, that if your
<HI>&s;pirit</HI> was willing to put up with it, fle&s;h and blood
could by no means agree, &s;o we humbly petition, that
your honour would make an end of the matter at once,
by running away with the Ju&s;tice's daughter, or el&s;e
get us fre&s;h quarters, hem! hem!</P>
</SP>

<P>There's the Red Lion ha'n't half the civility

<P>There's the White Hor&s;e, if he was'n't ca&s;e
hardened, ought to be a&s;hamed to &s;hew his face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, the Hor&s;e and the Lion &s;hall an|&s;wer
for it, at the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser</SPEAKER>
<P>The two Magpies are civil enough, but the An|gel
u&s;es us like devils, and the ri&s;ing &s;un refu&s;es us light
to go to bed by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then upon my word, I'll have the ri&s;ing &s;un
put down, and the Angel &s;hall give &s;ecurity for his good
behaviour, but are you &s;ure you do nothing to quit
&s;cores with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all your honour, unle&s;s now and
then we happen to fling a cartridge into the kitchen

fire, or put a &s;patterda&s;h or &s;o into the &s;oup&mdash;and &s;ome|times
Ned drums up and down &s;tairs a little of a night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh all that's fair, but hark'ee lads I mu&s;t have
no grumbling on St Patrick's day, &s;o here take this
and divide it among&s;t you. But ob&s;erve me now, &s;how
your&s;elves men of &s;pirit, and don't &s;pend &s;ix pence of it
in drink.</P>

<P>Nay hang it your honour, &s;oldiers &s;hould never

<P>Get along you thoughtle&s;s vagabonds, yet upon
my con&s;cience, 'tis very hard the&s;e poor fellows &s;hould
&s;carcely have bread from the &s;oil they would die to de|fend.</P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Doctor Ro&s;y.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Ah, my little Doctor Ro&s;y, my galen a-bridge, what's
the news?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>All things are as they were, my Alexander, the
Ju&s;tice is as violent as ever, I felt his pul&s;e on the mat|ter
again, and thinking his rage began to intermit, I
wanted to throw in the bark of good advice, but it would
not do. He &s;ays you and your cutthroats have a plot
upon his life, and &s;wears he had rather &s;ee his daughter
in a &s;carlet fever, than in the arms of a &s;oldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word the army is very much obliged
to him, well then, I mu&s;t marry the girl fir&s;t, and a&s;k
his con&s;ent afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, the ca&s;e of her fortune is de&s;perate, hey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>O hang fortune, let that take its chance, there
is a beauty in Lauretta's &s;implicity, &s;o pure a bloom
upon her charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>So there is, &s;o there is.&mdash;You are for beauty as
nature made her, hey! No artificial graces, no co&s;|metic
varni&s;h, no beauty in grain, hey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word Doctor, you are right, the Lon|don
ladies were always too hand&s;ome for me;&mdash;then they
are &s;o defended, &s;uch a circumvaluation of hoop, with
a brea&s;t work of whale bone, that would turn a pi&s;tol
bullet, much le&s;s Cupid's arrows, then turret on turret
on top, with &s;tores of concealed weapons, under pre|tence
of black pins, and above all, a &s;tandard of fea|thers,
that would do honour to a knight of the Bath.
Upon my con&s;cience I could as &s;oon embrace an Amo|&s;en
arm'd at all points.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, right my Alexander&mdash;my ta&s;te to a tit|tle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Doctor, though I admire mode&s;ty in
women, I like to &s;ee their faces. I am for the change|able
ro&s;e, but with one of the&s;e quality amazons, if
their midnight di&s;&s;ipations had left them blood enough
to rai&s;e a blu&s;h, they have not room enough in their
cheeks to &s;how it.&mdash;To be &s;ure, ba&s;hfulne&s;s is a very
pretty thing, but in my mind, there is nothing on
earth, &s;o impudent as an everla&s;ting blu&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>My ta&s;te, my ta&s;te&mdash;Well Lauretta is none of
the&s;e&mdash;Ah! I never &s;ee her, but &s;he puts me in mind of
my poor dear wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay faith, in my opinion &s;he can't do a wor&s;e
thing.&mdash;Now is he going to bother me about an old
hag that has been dead the&s;e &s;ix years. <STAGE>[A&s;ide.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh poor Dolly! I never &s;hall &s;ee her like again,
&s;uch an arm for a bandage&mdash;Veins that &s;eem'd to invite
the lancet. Then her &s;kin, &s;mooth and white as a gal|lipot
&mdash;her mouth as round and not larger than the
month of a penny phial. Her lips con&s;erve of ro&s;es&mdash;
and then her teeth&mdash;none of your &s;turdy fixtures&mdash;a&s;k
as they wou'd&mdash;it was but a &s;mall pull and out they
came. I believe I have drawn half a &s;core of her poor
dear pearls, <STAGE>(weeps)</STAGE> but what avails her beauty. Death
has no con&s;ideration&mdash;one mu&s;t die as well as another.</P>

<P>True, true my friend, grief can't mend the matter

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, for doubtle&s;s &s;he had mental ac|compli&s;hments
equal to her beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mental accompli&s;hments! &s;he would have &s;tuf|fed
an aligator, or pickled a lizard with any Apotheca|ry's
wife in the kingdom. Why &s;he could decypher a
pre&s;cription, and invent the ingredients, almo&s;t as well
as my&s;elf; then &s;he was &s;uch a hand at making foreign
waters for Setzer, Pyrmont, I&s;lington or Chaly beate
&s;he never had her equal&mdash;and her Bath and Bri&s;tol
&s;prings exceeded the originals&mdash;Ah! Poor Dolly, &s;he
fell a martyr to her own di&s;coveries.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor &s;oul, her illne&s;s was occa&s;ioned by her zeal
in trying an improvement on the Spa water, by an in|fu&s;ion
of rum and acid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, &s;pirits never agree with water drink|ers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you mi&s;take.&mdash;Rum agreed with her
well enough, it was not the rum that killed the poor
dear creature, for &s;he died of a drop&s;y. Well, &s;he is
gone never to return, and has left no pledge of our loves
behind&mdash;No little babe, to hang like a label round pa|pa's

<PB N="9" REF="9">

<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;ha! you know mama I hate militia officers,
a &s;et of dunghill cocks, with &s;purs on heroes &s;cratch'd
off a church door. Clowns in military ma&s;querade, wea|ring
the dre&s;s without &s;upporting the character. No,
give me the bold upright youth, who makes love to-day
