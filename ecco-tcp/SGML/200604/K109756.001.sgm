<HEAD>PREFACE, BY THE TRANSLATOR.</HEAD>
<P>FEW writers have been more ju&s;tly admired for originality, and grandeur of conception, than the celebrated Comte de Buffon. It was his lively eloquence that fir&s;t re&s;cued Natural Hi&s;tory from barbari&s;m, and rendered it an en|gaging and popular &s;tudy. With concern and indignation he beheld the faire&s;t of all the &s;ci|ences cramped by artificial &s;y&s;tems, encumbered by a coar&s;e and ob&s;cure jargon, and disfigured by credulity and ignorance. He was determin|ed to re&s;tore and decorate the fabric. Royal munificence happily &s;econded his views; and he was entru&s;ted with the direction of the fine&s;t cabinet in Europe. His lofty genius bur&s;t from the &s;hackles of method; he caught with ardour the varied magnificence of Nature's plan; and, with a ma&s;terly pencil, dipt in rich and glowing colours, he traced the animated picture. His
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
elegant and &s;pirited diction adorns whatever &s;ub|ject he treats; his various and exten&s;ive learn|ing at once plea&s;es and in&s;tructs. His graceful turn of &s;entiments engages our affections; the &s;ublimity of his de&s;criptions commands our ad|miration; and if the exuberance of his fancy has &s;ometimes laid him open to cen&s;ure, we are di&s;po&s;ed to overlook his errors for the brilliancy of his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>His Theory of the Earth was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1744; his Hi&s;tory of Man &s;oon followed; but that of Quadrupeds was not completed till 1767. The Hi&s;tory of Birds was next to be undertaken, a ta&s;k attended with peculiar diffi|culties. The &s;pecies of Birds are at lea&s;t ten times more numerous than tho&s;e of Quadru|peds, and are &s;ubject to endle&s;s varieties. Their mode of life expo&s;es them to the imme|diate influence of the &s;ea&s;ons; in a large pro|portion of them the migrations to remote cli|mates produce important alterations on their external appearance; and their hot tempera|ment &s;ometimes perverts their in&s;tincts, and gives birth to unnatural progeny that &s;erve to increa&s;e the confu&s;ion. The di&s;po&s;itions and oeconomy of Birds are in a great mea&s;ure re|moved from ob&s;ervation; and our knowledge, with regard to them, is nece&s;&s;arily &s;canty and imperfect. But M. de Buffon was not to be deterred by the difficulty and extent of the undertaking. The corre&s;pondents of the king's
<PB N="v" REF="4">
cabinet continued to tran&s;mit numerous com|munications, and &s;pecimens from all parts of the world. Above eighty arti&s;ts were under the direction of the younger M. Daubenton, employed five years in the drawing, engraving, and colouring, of upwards of a thou&s;and Birds. But the commencement of the work which the&s;e were intended to illu&s;trate was delayed two years, by rea&s;on of a &s;evere and tedious indi&s;po&s;ition, which during that &s;pace afflicted the excellent Naturali&s;t. And after he had re|covered his health, he reflected that at his ad|vanced period of life he could not rea&s;onably expect to be able to accompli&s;h the Hi&s;tory of Birds, and al&s;o that of Minerals, in which he had already made &s;ome advances. He judged it expedient therefore to have recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends; and he was peculiarly fortunate in the choice of the learned and elo|quent M. Gueneau de Montbeillard, who cheer|fully undertook the laborious ta&s;k, and compo&s;|ed the greate&s;t part of the two fir&s;t volumes of the Hi&s;tory of Birds, which appeared in 1771, under the name however of M. de Buffon. In his complexion of thought and mode of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, M. de Montbeillard followed &s;o clo&s;ely his illu&s;trious a&s;&s;ociate, that the Public could not perceive any change. It was now proper to throw off the ma&s;k; and in the publication of the four &s;ub&s;equent volumes, each author prefixed his name to his own articles. The
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
third volume was nearly printed when new a&s;|&s;i&s;tance was received from the communications of James Bruce, E&s;q. of Kinnaird. That ac|compli&s;hed and adventurous traveller in his return from Aby&s;&s;inia pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days with M. de Buffon at Paris. The Count was filled with admiration on &s;eeing the numerous and elegant drawings which Mr. Bruce had made of natural objects; and on &s;everal occa&s;ions he mentions the explorer of the &s;ource of the Nile in terms the mo&s;t flattering and re&s;pectful. Af|ter the publication of the &s;ixth volume in 1781, M. de Montbeillard was de&s;irous of devoting the whole of his lei&s;ure in compo&s;ing the Hi&s;tory of In&s;ects, which had become his favourite &s;tudy. The three remaining volumes were therefore written by M. de Buffon him&s;elf; though he acknowledges that the Abb&eacute; Bexon had collect|ed the nomenclature, formed mo&s;t of the de|&s;criptions, and communicated &s;everal important hints. The work was completed in 1783; and as only a few copies of the Illumined Plates were on &s;ale, and the&s;e extremely co&s;tly, a &s;mall &s;et of engravings were made to accommodate ordinary purcha&s;ers. M. de Buffon had about the &s;ame time fini&s;hed his Hi&s;tory of Minerals. He now entertained views of compo&s;ing the Hi&s;tory of Vegetables, in which delightful &s;ub|ject his ingenuity, his ta&s;te, and his erudition, eminently qualified him to &s;hine; but unfortu|nately for the Public the project was defeated
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
by the death of that great man on the 16th of April 1788.</P>
<P>To expatiate on the advantages ari&s;ing from an acquaintance with Natural Hi&s;tory might be deemed unnece&s;&s;ary. It affords an elegant and rational &s;pecies of entertainment; and as it re|quires no previous cour&s;e of &s;tudy, it &s;eems ad|mirably fitted to captivate the minds of youth, and to fix their attention. It di&s;pels many early prejudices, rai&s;es and warms their opening fancy, enlarges the circle of their ideas, and leads by ea&s;y and flowery &s;teps to the pur&s;uit of the ab|&s;tru&s;er &s;ciences. It conveys u&s;eful and intere&s;t|ing information re&s;pecting the &s;ituation of the va|rious countries, their climate, their productions, and the manners and oeconomy of the inhabit|ants. But above all, the contemplation of that order and de&s;ign, &s;o con&s;picuous in the works of Nature, allays the &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions, elevates the &s;oul to virtue and happine&s;s, and exhibits the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pects of that wi&s;dom and power which upholds and conducts the uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Books of Natural Hi&s;tory &s;eem, more than any others, to require tran&s;lation. They mu&s;t unavoidably abound with uncommon words and phra&s;es, which frequently create difficulties even to proficients in the language; the vivacity of the impre&s;&s;ion is at any rate weakened; and the reading, in&s;tead of fa&s;cinating by the plea&s;ure which it is calculated to afford, degenerates per|haps
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
into an irk&s;ome ta&s;k. The names of qua|drupeds, of birds, of fi&s;hes, of in&s;ects, and rep|tiles, of plants, and of minerals, are be&s;ides hard|ly ever explained accurately in dictionaries, and are frequently omitted altogether. There are many per&s;ons who might be deterred by the expence from purcha&s;ing the original, or who, from their &s;ituation and circum&s;tances in life, have not had lei&s;ure or opportunities of acquiring a compe|tent knowledge of the language in which it is compo&s;ed. To accommodate this numerous cla&s;s of readers, to increa&s;e the circulation of u&s;eful and popular works, is the chief object of tran&s;|lation. A diffu&s;ion of ta&s;te and information forms the di&s;tingui&s;hing feature of our own times. Men of a gloomy or &s;plenetic temper may de|claim again&s;t the frivolou&s;ne&s;s of the age: to decry the pre&s;ent and extol the pa&s;t, is indeed an inveterate, an incurable malady. Other periods have produced great and &s;hining cha|racters, who &s;oared above the prejudices and narrow views of their contemporaries. But a liberality of &s;entiment, unknown to our rude forefathers, now generally prevails; the &s;weete&s;t of all the virtues, and that which contributes the mo&s;t to alleviate the ills and heighten the joys of life, humanity and fellow-feeling, has &s;hed its lovely influence on all ranks; and never did the &s;un behold &s;uch a large portion of mankind &s;o enlightened, &s;o re&s;pectable, and &s;o happy.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8">
The great expence attending the publication of an exten&s;ive work, adorned with numerous plates, has long prevented Buffon's Natural Hi&s;|tory from appearing in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s. It is only a few years &s;ince a tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t part was given by Mr. Smellie of Edinburgh; and the favourable reception which this has met with, atte&s;ts &s;ufficiently its merit. But that gen|tleman has not cho&s;en to complete the ta&s;k. The Hi&s;tory of Minerals indeed, though replete with curious and often &s;olid information, is addre&s;&s;ed to a narrow circle of readers. But the Hi&s;tory of Birds po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every quality that could re|commend it to the public: it exhibits a clear and comprehen&s;ive view of the knowledge acquired in Ornithology, &s;cattered through a multiplicity of volumes and in various languages; it di&s;cu&s;&s;es and elucidates, with critical accuracy, the nu|merous controverted points; it reduces the whole to &s;implicity, order, and elegance; and, by large additions of valuable matter, it greatly extends the bounds of the &s;cience.</P>
<P>In tran&s;lating this work, I have &s;tudied to transfu&s;e the &s;pirit of the author into our language. I was aware of the tendency to adopt foreign idioms, and I was &s;olicitous to avoid that cen&s;ure. How far I have &s;uc|ceeded, the public will judge. Zoological de|&s;criptions aim not only at per&s;picuity, but re|quire the mo&s;t minute accuracy; in &s;uch parts, therefore, where the &s;ubject a&s;&s;umes a loftier
<PB N="x" REF="9">
tone, I have &s;tuck clo&s;e to the original. I have endeavoured to ob&s;erve a corre&s;ponding elevation of &s;tyle. There are &s;ome &s;prightly turns in the French which the ma&s;culine character of our lan|guage will not admit; but the&s;e inferior beauties are amply compen&s;ated by the &s;trength and dig|nity of its expre&s;&s;ion. The philo&s;ophy likewi&s;e of that ingenious people has a certain diffu&s;e &s;uperficial ca&s;t, not altogether &s;uited to the manly &s;en&s;e of the Briti&s;h nation. The tran&s;lator &s;hould have a regard to the ta&s;te of his countrymen whom he addre&s;&s;es; and, on proper occa&s;ions, he may, with advantage, be permitted to abridge and conden&s;e.</P>
<P>I have di&s;covered in the text a few inaccu|racies which I have taken the liberty to correct. A few notes which I have &s;ubjoined, will &s;erve to elucidate the pa&s;&s;ages. I have con&s;ulted the late&s;t authors who have either written expre&s;sly on Ornithology, or who have occa&s;ionally handled the &s;ubject; and the additions which I have thereby been enabled to make, will, I tru&s;t, prove not unacceptable. I have be&s;towed par|ticular attention to the nomenclature, which it is the principal aim of &s;y&s;tems to fix and a&s;cer|tain. The&s;e productions will, no doubt, rank very low in the e&s;timation of the philo&s;opher; yet they mu&s;t &s;till be regarded as u&s;eful helps to|wards the &s;tudy of Natural Hi&s;tory. It was the want of them that &s;o often occa&s;ions &s;uch ob|&s;curity and uncertainty in the writings of the
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
ancient naturali&s;ts. If to di&s;cover the name of an animal or a vegetable, we were obliged to &s;earch over and compare a whole &s;eries of de&s;criptions, the fatigue would be intolerable. No per&s;on objects to a dictionary, becau&s;e the words follow alphabetically, and not according to their gra|dation of meaning. If by means of arrange|ment, how artificial &s;oever, we can, from a few obvious characters, refer an object &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to its order, its genus, and its &s;pecies, we &s;hall trace out its name, and thence learn its properties with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure: and even though contiguous divi&s;ions always run into one another, the num|ber of po&s;&s;ible trials is at any rate much limited, and the labour of the inve&s;tigation abridged. To complete Natural Hi&s;tory requires the union of Buffon and Linnaeus. With this view there|fore, I have given an ab&s;tract of the Linnaean cla&s;&s;ification of Birds from the la&s;t edition of his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> by Gmelin, in 1788; and to each article of the work I have joined his names and &s;ynonyms, with a tran&s;lation of the &s;pecifie character. Mo&s;t of the other additions I owe to Mr. Latham, and particularly to Mr. Pennant: I &s;hould be ungrateful did I not acknowledge the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I have received from the vari|ous and entertaining works of this amiable na|turali&s;t.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the pains which I have be&s;towed to render this work complete, I deliver it to the public with the anxiety that naturally
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
accompanies a fir&s;t attempt. It is compo&s;ed at an early period of life, and in the retirement of the country. Some inaccuracies and blemi&s;hes may have eluded my attention. Motives of pru|dence will determine me to withhold my name: for hard is the lot of the tran&s;lator; his humble toil is commonly beheld with di&s;dain; and the utmo&s;t he can expect is to e&s;cape cen&s;ure. This &s;upercilious treatment has already occa&s;ioned pernicious effects. Men of &s;uperior talents have generally de&s;erted a path that leads neither to honour nor emolument. Hence the purity of our language has been violated by an inundation of vicious and foreign idioms, and tran&s;lations have often been written, that really merit con|tempt. Should the public al&s;o frown upon <HI>my</HI> labours, I &s;hall at lea&s;t con&s;ole my&s;elf with the hope, that the experience of maturer years may correct my errors. But if it will deign to re|ceive this work with indulgence (this is all that I intreat), the approbation will animate my exer|tions and heighten my enjoyments.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE NATURE OF BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE word Nature has in all languages two very different acceptations. It de|notes either that Being, to the operation of which we u&s;ually a&s;cribe the chain of effects that con&s;titute the phaenomena of the univer&s;e; or it &s;ignifies the aggregate of the qualities im|planted in man, or in the various quadrupeds, and birds, &amp;c. It is <HI>active</HI> nature that, &s;tamp|ing their peculiar characters, thus forms <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> nature; whence are derived the <HI>in&s;tincts</HI> of ani|mals, their <HI>habits,</HI> and their <HI>faculties.</HI> We have in a former work treated of the nature of Man and the Quadrupeds; that of Birds now de|mands our attention: and though the &s;ubject is, in many re&s;pects, more ob&s;cure, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;elect the di&s;criminating features, and to place them in the proper point of view.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="17">
Perception, or rather the faculty of feeling; in&s;tinct, which re&s;ults from it; and talent, which con&s;i&s;ts in the habitual exerci&s;e of the natural powers; are widely di&s;tingui&s;hed in different beings. The&s;e intimate qualities depend upon organization in general, and e&s;pecially upon that of the &s;en&s;es: they are not only propor|tioned to the degree of the perfection of the&s;e; they have al&s;o a relation to the order of &s;uperi|ority that is e&s;tabli&s;hed. In man, for in&s;tance, the &s;en&s;e of touch is more exqui&s;ite than in all other animals; in the&s;e, on the contrary, &s;mell is more perfect than in man: for touch is the foundation of knowledge, and &s;mell is only the &s;ource of perception. But, as few per&s;ons di&s;|tingui&s;h nicely the &s;hades that di&s;criminate be|tween ideas and &s;en&s;ations, knowledge and per|ception, rea&s;on and in&s;tinct, we &s;hall &s;et a&s;ide what are termed <HI>ratiocination, di&s;cernment,</HI> and <HI>judgment</HI>; and we &s;hall only con&s;ider the differ|ent combinations of &s;imple perception, and en|deavour to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of that diver|&s;ity of in&s;tinct, which, though infinitely varied in the immen&s;e number of &s;pecies, &s;eems more con&s;tant, more uniform, and more regular, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s &s;ubject to caprice and error, than rea&s;on in the &s;ingle &s;pecies which boa&s;ts the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>

In all birds the or|gan or &s;ight is furni&s;hed with two membranes, an external and internal, additional to tho&s;e which occur in man: the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This internal eye-lid <HI>(membrana nictitans)</HI> occurs in &s;everal quadrupeds; but in mo&s;t of them it is not moveable as in birds.</NOTE>, or external membrane, is placed in the large angle of the eye, and is a &s;econd and more tran&s;parent eye|lid, who&s;e motions too are directed at plea&s;ure, and who&s;e u&s;e is to clear and poli&s;h the cornea: it &s;erves al&s;o to temper the exce&s;s of light, and con&s;equently to adju&s;t the quantity admitted, to the extreme delicacy of the organ: the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">In the eyes of a turkey cock, the optic nerve, which was &s;ituated very near the &s;ide, after perforating the &s;clerotic and cho|roid coats, &s;pread into a round &s;pace, from the circumference of which a number of black filaments were &s;ent off to form by their union a membrane which is found <HI>in all birds.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">In the eyes of the o&s;trich, the optic nerve, after perforating the &s;clerotic and choroid coats, was dilated into a &s;ort of funnel of a &s;imilar &s;ub&s;tance: this funnel is not commonly round in birds, where we have almo&s;t always found the extremity of the optic nerve flattened and com|pre&s;&s;ed within the eye: from this funnel a folded membrane took its origin, forming a &s;ort of pur&s;e that drew to a point. This pur&s;e, which was &s;ix lines broad at the ba&s;e, where it grew out of the op|tic nerve, was black, and &s;eemed imbued, and quite penetrated by that colour, which on the choroid is only &s;pread, and may be rub|bed off with the fingers.</Q>  <BIBL><HI>Memoires pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'Hi&s;t. des Anim.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> other <PB N="4" REF="19"> is &s;ituated at the bottom of the eye,
and appears to be an expan&s;ion of the optic nerve, which, receiving more
immediately the impre&s;&s;ions of the rays, mu&s;t be much more &s;en&s;ible
than in other animals; and hence the &s;ight is in birds va&s;tly more perfect,
and embraces a wider range. A &s;parrow-hawk, while he hovers in the air,
e&s;pies a lark &s;itting on a clod, though at twenty times the di&s;tance at

&s;mall lizards, field-mice, birds, &amp;c. and from this lofty &s;tation he
&s;elects what he de&s;tines to be victims of his rapine. But this prodigious
extent of vi&s;ion is accompanied like|wi&s;e with an equal accuracy and
clearne&s;s; for the eye can dilate or contract, can be &s;haded or uncovered,
depre&s;&s;ed or made protuberant, and thus it will readily a&s;&s;ume the
preci&s;e form &s;uited to the quantity of light and the di&s;tance of the

<P>Sight has a reference al&s;o to motion and &s;pace; and, if birds trace the mo&s;t rapid cour&s;e, we might expect them to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a &s;uperior degree that &s;en&s;e which is proper to guide and direct their flight. If Nature, while &s;he endow|ed them with great agility and va&s;t mu&s;cular
<PB N="5" REF="20">
&s;trength, had formed them &s;hort-&s;ighted, their latent powers would have availed them no|thing; and the danger of da&s;hing again&s;t every intervening ob&s;tacle would have repre&s;&s;ed or ex|tingui&s;hed their ardour. Indeed, we may con|&s;ider the celerity with which an animal moves, as the ju&s;t indication of the perfection of its vi|&s;ion. A bird, for in&s;tance, that &s;hoots &s;wiftly through the air, mu&s;t undoubtedly &s;ee better than one which &s;lowly de&s;cribes a waving tract. Among the quadrupeds too, the <HI>&s;loths</HI> have their eyes enveloped, and their &s;ight is limited.</P>
<P>The idea of motion, and all the other ideas which accompany or flow from it, &s;uch as tho&s;e of relative velocities, of the extent of country, of the proportional height of eminences, and of the various inequalities that prevail on the &s;urface, are, therefore, more preci&s;e in birds, and occupy a larger &s;hare of their conceptions than in qua|drupeds. Nature would &s;eem to have pointed out this &s;uperiority of vi&s;ion by the more con|&s;picuous and more elaborate &s;tructure of its or|gan; for in birds the eye is larger in proportion to the bulk of the head than in quadrupeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">The ball of the eye in a female eagle was, at its greate&s;t width, an inch and half in diameter; that of the male was three lines le&s;s.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'Hi&s;t. des Animaux.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>Another cau&s;e of the difference between the in&s;tincts of birds and of quadrupeds, is the na|ture of the element in which they live. The birds know better than man, perhaps, all the de|grees of re&s;i&s;tance of the air, its temperature at different heights, its relative den&s;ity, &amp;c. They fore&s;ee more than us, they indicate better than our barometers or thermometers, the changes which happen in that voluble fluid. Often have they &s;truggled again&s;t the violence of the wind, and oftener have they borrowed its aid. The eagle, &s;oaring above the clouds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It can be proved that the eagle, and other birds of lofty flight, can ri&s;e perpendicularly above the clouds; for they frequently mount entirely out of our &s;ight. But in day-light an object cea&s;es to be vi&s;ible when it exceeds 3, 436 times its diameter; if, therefore, the extent of the bird be five feet, it will be &s;een at the height of 17, 180 feet, or above three miles.</NOTE>, can quickly e&s;cape from the &s;cene of the &s;torm to the region of calm, and there enjoy a &s;erene &s;ky and a bright &s;un, while the other animals below are involved in darkne&s;s, and expo&s;ed to all the fury of the tempe&s;t. In twenty-four hours it can change its climate, and &s;ailing over the dif|ferent countries, it will form a picture which exceeds the powers of our imagination. Our bird's-eye views, of which the accurate execution is &s;o tedious and &s;o difficult, give very imperfect
<PB N="7" REF="22">
notions of the relative inequality of the &s;urfaces which they repre&s;ent. But birds can chu&s;e the proper &s;tations, can &s;ucce&s;&s;ively traver&s;e the field in all directions, and with one glance compre|hend the whole. The quadruped knows only the &s;pot where it feeds; its valley, its moun|tain, or its plain: it has no conception of the expan&s;e of &s;urface, no idea of immen&s;e di&s;|tances, and no de&s;ire to pu&s;h forward its ex|cur&s;ions. Hence remote journies and migra|tions are as rare among the quadrupeds as they are frequent among the birds. It is this de&s;ire, founded on their acquaintance with foreign countries, on the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their expedi|tious cour&s;e, and on their fore&s;ight of the changes that will happen in the atmo&s;phere and of the revolution of &s;ea&s;ons, that prompt them to retire together, and by common con&s;ent. When their food begins to grow &s;carce, when, as the cold or the heat incommodes them, they re|&s;olve on their retreat, the parents collect their young, and the different families a&s;&s;emble and communicate their views to the unexperienced; and the whole body, &s;trengthened by their num|bers, and actuated by the &s;ame common mo|tives, wing their journey to &s;ome di&s;tant land.</P>
<P>This propen&s;ity to migration, which recurs every &s;pring and autumn, is a &s;ort of violent longing, which, even in captive birds, bur&s;ts out in &s;ymptoms of re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations. We &s;hall, at the article of the Quail, give a detail
<PB N="8" REF="23">
of ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject; from which it will appear, that this propen&s;ity is one of their mo&s;t powerful in&s;tincts; and that, though they u&s;ually remain tranquil in their pri&s;on, they make every exertion at tho&s;e periods to regain their liberty, and join their companions.&mdash;But the circum&s;tances which attend migration vary in different birds; and, before we enter into the full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which that &s;ubject merits, we &s;hall pur&s;ue our inve&s;tigation of the cau&s;es that form and modify their in&s;tincts.</P>
<P>Man is eminently &s;uperior to all the animals in the &s;en&s;e of touch, perhaps too in that of ta&s;te; but he is inferior to mo&s;t of them in the other three &s;en&s;es. When we compare the ani|mals with each other, we &s;oon perceive that &s;mell in general is more acute among the qua|drupeds than among the birds: for though we &s;peak of the &s;cent of the crow, of the vulture, &amp;c. it undoubtedly obtains in a much lower degree; and we might be convinced of this by merely examining the &s;tructure of the organ. In mo&s;t of the winged tribes, the external no&s;trils are wanting, and the effluvia, which excite the &s;en|&s;ation, have acce&s;s only to the duct leading from the palate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. des Sciences, tome i. p. 430.</BIBL></NOTE>: and even in tho&s;e where the or|gan is di&s;clo&s;ed, the nerves, which take their origin from it, are far from being &s;o numerous, &s;o large, or &s;o expanded, as in the quadruped.
<PB N="9" REF="24">
We may therefore regard touch in man, &s;mell in the quadruped, &s;ight in the bird, as the three mo&s;t perfect &s;en&s;es, and which influence the general character.</P>
<P>Next to &s;ight, the mo&s;t perfect of the &s;en&s;es in birds is hearing, which is even &s;uperior to that of the quadrupeds. We perceive with what facility they retain and repeat tones, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ions of notes, and even di&s;cour&s;e; we de|light to li&s;ten to their unwearied &s;ongs, to the ince&s;&s;ant warbling of their happy loves. Their ear and throat are more ductile and more power|ful than in other animals. Mo&s;t of the qua|drupeds are habitually &s;ilent; and their voice, which is &s;eldom heard, is almo&s;t always har&s;h and di&s;agreeable. In birds it is &s;weet, plea&s;ant, and melodious. There are &s;ome &s;pecies, indeed, in which the notes &s;eem un&s;upportable, e&s;peci|ally if compared with tho&s;e of others; but the&s;e are few in number, and comprehend the large kinds, which Nature, be&s;towing on them hoar&s;e loud cries, &s;uited to their bulk, would incline to treat like quadrupeds. A peacock, which is not the hundredth part of the &s;ize of an ox, may be heard farther; the nightingale could fill a wider &s;pace with its mu&s;ic than the human voice: this prodigious extent, and the great powers of their organs of &s;ound, depend entirely on the &s;tructure; but that their &s;ong &s;hould be continued and &s;upported, re&s;ults &s;olely from their
<PB N="10" REF="25">
internal emotions. The&s;e two circum&s;tances ought to be con&s;idered &s;eparately.</P>
<P>The pectoral mu&s;cles are more fle&s;hy and much &s;tronger in birds than in man or the quadrupeds, and their action is immen&s;ely greater. Their wings are broad and light, com|po&s;ed of thin hollow bones, and connected by powerful tendons. The ea&s;e with which birds fly, the celerity of their cour&s;e, and even their power of directing it upwards or downwards, depend on the proportion of the impelling &s;ur|face to the ma&s;s of the body. When they are ponderous, and the wings and tail at the &s;ame time &s;hort, like the bu&s;tard, the ca&s;&s;owary, or the o&s;trich, they can hardly ri&s;e from the ground.</P>
<P>The windpipe is wider and &s;tronger in birds than in quadrupeds, and u&s;ually terminates be|low in a large cavity that augments the &s;ound. The lungs too have greater extent, and &s;end off many appendices which form air-bags, that at once a&s;&s;i&s;t the motion, by rendering the body &s;pecifically lighter, and give additional force to the voice. A little production of the cartilage of the <HI>trachea</HI> in the howling baboon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Simia&mdash;Beelzebut. <HI>Linn.</HI></NOTE>, which is a quadruped of a middle &s;ize only, and of the or|dinary &s;tructure, has enabled it to &s;cream almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o loud, as to be heard at more than a league's di&s;tance: but in birds,

<P>There is another circum&s;tance which evinces that birds have a prodigious power of voice: the cries of many &s;pecies are uttered in the higher regions of the atmo&s;phere, where the rarity of the medium mu&s;t con&s;equently weaken the effect. That the rarefaction of the air di|mini&s;hes &s;ounds is well a&s;certained from pneu|matical experiments; and I can add, from my own ob&s;ervation, that, even in the open air, a &s;en&s;ible difference in this re&s;pect may be per|ceived. I have often &s;pent whole days in the fore&s;ts, where I was obliged to li&s;ten clo&s;ely to

the di&s;tant cries of the dogs, or &s;houts of the hunters; I uniformly found that the &s;ame noi&s;es were much le&s;s audible during the heat of the day, between ten and four o'clock, than in the evening, and particularly in the night, who&s;e &s;tillne&s;s would make hardly any alteration, &s;ince in the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered &s;cenes there is nothing to di&s;turb the harmony but the &s;light buzz of in|fects and the chirping of &s;ome birds. I have ob&s;erved a &s;imilar difference between the fro&s;ty days in winter and the heats of &s;ummer. This can be imputed only to the variation in the den&s;ity of the air. Indeed, the difference &s;eems to be &s;o great, that I have often been unable to di&s;tingui&s;h in mid-day, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix hundred paces, the &s;ame voice which I could, at &s;ix o'clock in the morning or evening, hear at that of twelve or fifteen hundred paces.&mdash;A bird may ri&s;e at lea&s;t to the height of &s;eventeen thou&s;and feet, for it is there ju&s;t vi&s;ible. A flock of &s;everal hundred &s;torks, gee&s;e, or ducks, mu&s;t mount &s;till higher, &s;ince, notwith&s;tanding the &s;pace which they occupy, they &s;oar almo&s;t out of &s;ight. If the cry of birds therefore may be heard from an altitude of above a league, we may reckon it at lea&s;t four times as power|ful as that of men or quadrupeds, which is not audible at more than half a league's di&s;tance on the &s;urface. But this e&s;timation is even too low: for, be&s;ide the di&s;&s;ipation of force to be attributed to the cau&s;e already a&s;&s;igned, the
<PB N="13" REF="30">
&s;ound is propagated in the higher regions as from a centre in all directions, and only a part of it reaches the ground; but, when made at the &s;urface, the aerial waves are reflected as they roll along, and the lateral and vertical effect is augmented. It is hence that a per&s;on on the top of a tower hears one better at the bottom, than the per&s;on below hears from above.</P>
<P>Sweetne&s;s of voice and melody of &s;ong are qualities which in birds are partly natural, part|ly acquired. Their great facility in catching and repeating &s;ounds enables them not only to borrow from each other, but often to copy the inflexions and tones of the human voice, and of our mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Is it not &s;ingular, that in all populous and civilized countries, mo&s;t of the birds chant delightful airs, while, in the exten&s;ive de&s;erts of Africa and America, inha|bited by roving &s;avages, the winged tribes utter only har&s;h and di&s;cordant cries, and but a few &s;pecies have any claim to melody? Mu&s;t this difference be imputed to the difference of cli|mate alone? The extremes of cold and heat operate indeed great changes on the nature of animals, and often form externally permanent characters and vivid colours. The quadrupeds of which the garb is variegated, &s;potted, or &s;triped, &s;uch as the panthers, the leopards, the zebras, and the civets, are all natives of the hotte&s;t climates. All the birds of the tropical regions &s;parkle with the mo&s;t glowing tints,
<PB N="14" REF="31">
while tho&s;e of the temperate countries are &s;tain|ed with lighter and &s;ofter &s;hades. Of the three hundred &s;pecies that may be reckoned belong|ing to our climates, the peacock, the common cock, the golden oriole, the king-fi&s;her, and the goldfinch, only can be celebrated for the va|riety of their colours; but Nature would &s;eem to have exhau&s;ted all the rich hues of the uni|ver&s;e on the plumage of the birds of America, of Africa, and of India. The&s;e quadrupeds, clothed in the mo&s;t &s;plendid robes, the&s;e birds attired in the riche&s;t plumage, utter at the &s;ame time hoar&s;e, grating, or even terrible cries. Climate has no doubt a principal &s;hare in this phaenomenon; but does not the influence of man contribute al&s;o to the effect? In all the do|me&s;ticated animals, the colours never heighten, but grow &s;ofter and fainter: many examples oc|cur among the quadrupeds; and cocks and pigeons are &s;till more variegated than dogs or hor&s;es. The real alteration which the human powers have produced on nature, exceeds our fonde&s;t imagination: the whole face of the globe is changed; the milder animals are tamed and &s;ubdued, and the more ferocious are re|pre&s;&s;ed and extirpated. They imitate our man|ners; they adopt our &s;entiments; and, under our tuition, their faculties expand. In the &s;tate of nature, the dog has the &s;ame qualities and di&s;po&s;itions, though in an inferior degree, with the tiger, the leopard, or the lion; for the
<PB N="15" REF="32">
character of the carnivorous tribe re&s;ults &s;olely from the acutene&s;s of their &s;mell and ta&s;te: but education has mollified his original ferocity, improved his &s;agacity, and rendered him the companion and a&s;&s;ociate of man.</P>
<P>Our influence is &s;maller on the birds than on the quadrupeds, becau&s;e their nature is more different from our own, and becau&s;e they are le&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of attachment. Tho&s;e we call <HI>dome&s;tic,</HI> are only pri&s;oners, which, but for propagating, are u&s;ele&s;s during their lives; they are victims, multiplied without trouble, and &s;acrificed without regret. As their in&s;tincts are totally unrelated to our own, we find it impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;til our &s;entiments; and their education is merely mechanical. A bird, who&s;e ear is delicate, and who&s;e voice is flex|ible, li&s;tens to di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;oon learns to re|peat the words, but without feeling their force. Some have indeed been taught to hunt and fetch game; &s;ome have been trained to fondle their in&s;tructor: but the&s;e &s;entiments are in|finitely below what we communicate &s;o readily to the quadrupeds. What compari&s;on between the attachment of a dog, and the familiarity of a canary bird; between the under&s;tanding of an elephant, and the &s;agacity of an o&s;trich?</P>
<P>The natural tones of birds, &s;etting a&s;ide tho&s;e derived from education, expre&s;s the vari|ous modifications of pa&s;&s;ion; they change even according to the different times or circum|&s;tances.
<PB N="16" REF="33">
The females are much more &s;ilent than the males; they have cries of pain or fear, mur|murs of inquietude or &s;olicitude, e&s;pecially for their young; but &s;ong is generally withheld from them. In the male it &s;prings from &s;weet emotion, from tender de&s;ire; the canary in his cage, the greenfinch in the fields, the oriole in the woods, chant their loves with a &s;onorous voice, and their mates reply in feeble notes of con&s;ent. The nightingale, when he fir&s;t ar|rives in the &s;pring, is &s;ilent; he begins in faultering unfrequent airs: it is not until the dam &s;its on her eggs, that he pours out the warm melody of his heart: then he relieves and foothes her tedious incubation; then he re|doubles his care&s;&s;es, and warbles more patheti|cally his amorous tale. And what proves that love is among birds the real &s;ource of their mu|&s;ic is, that, after the breeding &s;ea&s;on is over, it either cea&s;es entirely, or lo&s;es its &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>This melody, which is each year renewed, and which la&s;ts only two or three months during the &s;ea&s;on of love, and changes into har&s;h low notes on the &s;ub&s;idence of that pa&s;&s;ion, indicates a phy&s;ical relation between the organs of genera|tion and tho&s;e of voice, which is mo&s;t con&s;picu|ous in birds. It is well known that the articu|lation is never confirmed in the human &s;pecies before the age of puberty; and that the bellow|ing of quadrupeds becomes tremendous when they are actuated by their fiery lu&s;ts. The re|pletion
<PB N="17" REF="34">
of the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els irritates the parts of generation, and by &s;ympathy affects the throat. Hence the growth of the beard, the forming of the voice, and the exten&s;ion of the genital organ in the male; the &s;well of the brea&s;ts, and the expan&s;ion of the glandulous bo|dies in the female. In birds the changes are more con&s;iderable; not only are the&s;e parts &s;timulated or altered; after being in appearance entirely de|&s;troyed, they are even renovated by the opera|tion of the &s;ame cau&s;es. The te&s;ticles, which in man and mo&s;t of the quadrupeds remain nearly the &s;ame at all times, contract and wa&s;te almo&s;t entirely away in birds after the breeding &s;ea&s;on is over, and on its return they expand to a &s;ize that even appears di&s;proportioned. It would be curious to di&s;cover if there is not &s;ome new pro|duction in the organs of the voice, corre&s;ponding to this &s;well in the parts of generation.</P>
<P>Man &s;eems even to have given a direction to love, that appetite which Nature has the mo&s;t deeply implanted in the animal frame. The dome&s;tic quadrupeds and birds are almo&s;t con|&s;tantly in &s;ea&s;on, while tho&s;e which roam in perfect freedom are only at certain &s;tated times &s;timulated by the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. The cock, the pigeon, and the duck, have, equally with the hor&s;e, the ram, and the dog, undergone this im|portant change of con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But the birds excel the other animals in the powers of generation, and in their aptitude for
<PB N="18" REF="35">
motion. Many &s;pecies &s;carcely re&s;t a &s;ingle mo|ment, and the rapacious tribes pur&s;ue their prey without halting or turning a&s;ide, while the qua|drupeds need to be frequently recruited.&mdash;To give &s;ome idea of the rapidity and continuance of the flight of birds, let us compare it with the celerity of the fleete&s;t land-animals. The &s;tag, the rein-deer, and the elk, can travel forty leagues a-day; the rein-deer can draw its fledge at the rate of thirty leagues for &s;everal days. The camel can perform a journey of three hun|dred leagues in eight days. The choice&s;t race|hor&s;e can run a league in &s;ix or &s;even minutes; but he &s;oon &s;lackens his career, and could not long &s;upport &s;uch an exertion. I have el&s;ewhere mentioned the in&s;tance of an Engli&s;hman who rode &s;ixty-two leagues in eleven hours and thirty-two minutes, changing hor&s;es twenty-one times: &s;o that the be&s;t hor&s;e could not travel more than four leagues in an hour, or thirty leagues in a day. But the motion of birds is va&s;tly &s;wifter: an eagle, who&s;e diameter exceeds four feet, ri&s;es out of &s;ight in le&s;s than three minutes, and therefore mu&s;t fly more than 3,500 yards in one minute, or twenty leagues in an hour. At this rate, a bird would ea&s;ily perform a jour|ney of two hundred leagues in a day, &s;ince ten hours would be &s;ufficient, which would allow frequent halts, and the whole night for repo&s;e. Our &s;wallows, and other migratory birds, might therefore reach the equator in &s;even or eight

Taking all the&s;e facts together, I think we may conclude that a bird of vigorous wing could every day pa&s;s through four or five times more &s;pace than the fleete&s;t quadruped.</P>
<P>Every thing con&s;pires to the rapidity of a bird's motion: fir&s;t, the feathers are very light, have a broad &s;urface, and their &s;hafts are hol|low: &s;econdly, the wings are convex above and concave below; they are firm and wide &s;pread, and the mu&s;cles which act upon them are power|ful:
<PB N="20" REF="37">
thirdly, the body is proportionally light, for the flat bones are thinner than in the quadru|peds, and hollow bones have much larger cavi|ties. <Q REND="inline">The &s;keleton of the pelican,</Q> &s;ay the anatomi&s;ts of the Academy, <Q REND="inline">is extremely light, not weighing more than twenty-three ounces, though it is of con&s;iderable bulk.</Q> This quality dimini&s;hes the &s;pecific gravity of birds.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence which &s;eems to re&s;ult from the texture of the bones, is the longevity of birds. In man and the quadrupeds, the pe|riod of life &s;eems to be in general regulated by the time required to attain the full growth: but in birds it follows different proportions; their progre&s;s is rapid to maturity; &s;ome run as &s;oon as they quit the &s;hell, and fly &s;hortly afterwards: a cock can copulate when only four months old, and yet does not acquire his full &s;ize in le&s;s than a year. Land animals generally live &s;ix or &s;even times as long as they take to reach the age of puberty; but in birds the pro|portion is ten times greater, for I have &s;een lin|nets fourteen or fifteen years old, cocks twenty, and parrots above thirty, and they would pro|bably go beyond the&s;e limits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A per&s;on of veracity a&s;&s;ured me, that a parrot layed at about forty years of age, without commerce with any male, at lea&s;t of its own kind.&mdash;It is &s;aid, that a &s;wan has lived three hundred years; a goo&s;e eighty; and a pelican as many. The eagle and crow are famous for longevity. <BIBL>ENCYCLOPEDIE, article <HI>Oi&s;eau.</HI></BIBL>&mdash;Aldrovandus relates; that a pigeon lived twenty-two years, and cea&s;ed to breed only the la&s;t &s;ix years.&mdash;Willoughby &s;ays, that linnets live fourteen years, and goldfinches twenty-three, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This difference
<PB N="21" REF="38">
I &s;hould attribute to the &s;oft porous quality of the bones; for the general o&s;&s;ification and rigi|dity of the &s;y&s;tem to which animals perpetually tend, determine the boundary of life; that will therefore be prolonged, if the parts want &s;olidity and con&s;i&s;tence. It is thus that women arrive oftener at old age than men; that birds live longer than quadrupeds, and that fi&s;hes live longer than birds.</P>
<P>But a more particular inquiry will evince that uniformity of plan which prevails through nature. The birds, as well as the quadrupeds, are carnivorous, or granivorous. In the former cla&s;s, the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are proportion|ally &s;mall; but tho&s;e of the latter have a craw additional, corre&s;ponding to the fal&s;e belly in ruminating animals, and the capacity of the ventricle compen&s;ates for the un&s;ub&s;tantial qua|lity of their de&s;tined food. The granivorous birds have al&s;o two <HI>caeca,</HI> and a very &s;trong mu&s;cular &s;tomach, which &s;erves to triturate the hard &s;ub&s;tances which they &s;wallow.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;itions and habits of animals depend greatly on their original appetites. We may therefore compare the eagle, noble and gene|rous, to the lion; the vulture, cruel and in&s;a|tiable, to the tiger; the kite, the buzzard, the crow, which only prowl among carrion and garbage, to the hyaenas, the wolves, and jackals. The falcons, the &s;parrow-hawks, the gos-hawks, and the other birds trained for &s;port, are analo|gous
<PB N="22" REF="39">
to the dogs, the foxes, the ounces, and the lynxes; the owls, which prey in the night, re|pre&s;ent the cats; the herons, and the cormo|rants, which live upon fi&s;h, corre&s;pond to the beavers and otters; and, in their mode of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, the woodpeckers re&s;emble the ant|eaters. The common cock, the peacock, the turkey, and all the birds furni&s;hed with a craw, bear a relation to the ox, the &s;heep, the goat, and other ruminating animals. With regard to the article of food, birds have a more ample latitude than quadrupeds; fle&s;h, fi&s;h, the amphibious tribes, reptiles, in&s;ects, fruits, grain, &s;eeds, roots, herbs; in a word, whatever lives or vegetates. Nor are they very nice in their choice, but often catch indifferently at what they can mo&s;t ea&s;ily obtain. The &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te is much le&s;s acute in birds than in quadrupeds; for, if we except &s;uch as are carnivorous, their tongue and palate are in general hard, and almo&s;t cartilaginous. Smell can alone direct them, and this they po&s;|&s;e&s;s in an inferior degree. The greater number &s;wallow without ta&s;ting, and ma&s;tication, which con&s;titutes the chief plea&s;ure in eating, is en|tirely wanting to them. Hence, on all the&s;e accounts, they are &s;o little attentive to the &s;elec|tion of their food, that they often poi&s;on them|&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Par&s;ley, coffee, bitter almonds, &amp;c. prove poi&s;onous to hens, parrots, and many other birds, which eat the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances with avi|dity when pre&s;ented with other food.</NOTE>.</P>

As Nature has inve&s;ted the quadrupeds which haunt mar&s;hes, or inhabit cold countries, with a double fur, and with thick clo&s;e hair; &s;o has &s;he clothed the aquatic birds, and tho&s;e which live in the northern tracts, with abundance of plum|age, and a fine down; in&s;omuch that, from this circum&s;tance alone, we may judge of their pro|per element, or of their natal region. In all cli|mates, the birds which dwell in the water are nearly equally feathered, and have under the tail large glands, containing an oily &s;ub&s;tance for anointing their plumes, which, together with their thickne&s;s, prevents the moi&s;ture from in&s;i|nuating.

Wild ducks moult rather before that time.&mdash;I owe the&s;e remarks to M.

<P>We might deem it as e&s;&s;ential to the bird to fly, as it is to the fi&s;h to &s;wim, or to the qua|druped to walk; yet in all the&s;e tribes there are exceptions to the general property. Among
<PB N="27" REF="44">
quadrupeds the rufous, red and common bats, can only fly; the &s;eals, the &s;ea-hor&s;es, and &s;ea|cows, can only &s;wim; and the beavers and otters walk with more difficulty than &s;wim: and, la&s;tly, there are others, &s;uch as the &s;loth, which can hardly drag along their bodies. In the &s;ame manner, we find among birds the o&s;|trich, the ca&s;&s;owary, the dodo, the touyou, &amp;c. which are incapable of flying, and are obliged to walk; others, &s;uch as the penguins, the &s;ea|parrots, &amp;c. which fly and &s;wim, but never walk; and others, in fine, which, like the bird of paradi&s;e, can neither walk nor &s;wim, but are perpetually on the wing. It appears, however, that water is, on the whole, more &s;uited to the nature of birds than to that of quadrupeds: for, if we except a few &s;pecies, all the land animals &s;hun that element, and never &s;wim, unle&s;s they are urged by their fears or wants. Of the birds, on the contrary, a large tribe con&s;tantly dwell on the waters, and never go on &s;hore, but for particular purpo&s;es, &s;uch as to depo&s;ite their eggs, &amp;c. And what proves this po&s;ition, there are only three or four quadrupeds which have their toes connected by webs; whereas we may reckon above three hundred birds which are furni&s;hed with &s;uch membranes. The lightne&s;s of their feathers and of their bones, and even the &s;hape of their body, contribute greatly to the facility with which they &s;wim, and their feet &s;erve as oars to impel them along. Accord|ingly,
<PB N="28" REF="45">
certain birds di&s;cover an early propen&s;ity to the water; the ducklings &s;ail on the &s;urface of the pool long before they can u&s;e their wings.</P>
<P>In quadrupeds, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which have their feet terminated by hard hoofs or nails, the palate &s;eems to be the principal &s;eat of touch as well as of ta&s;te. Birds, on the other hand, oftener feel bodies with their toes; but the in|&s;ide of the&s;e is covered with a callous &s;kin, and their tongue and mouth are almo&s;t cartilagi|nous: &s;o that, on both accounts, their &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t be blunt.</P>
<P>Such then is the order of the &s;en&s;es which Nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed in the different beings. In man, touch is the fir&s;t, or the mo&s;t perfect; ta&s;te the &s;econd; &s;ight the third; hearing the fourth; and &s;mell the fifth and la&s;t. In quadru|peds, &s;mell is the fir&s;t; ta&s;te the &s;econd, or rather the&s;e two &s;en&s;es form only one; &s;ight the third; hearing the fourth; and touch the la&s;t. In birds, &s;ight is the fir&s;t; hearing the &s;econd; touch the third; and ta&s;te and &s;mell the la&s;t. The pre|dominating &s;en&s;ations will al&s;o follow the &s;ame order: man will be mo&s;t affected by touch; the quadrupeds by &s;mell; and the birds by &s;ight. The&s;e will likewi&s;e give a ca&s;t to the general character, &s;ince certain motives of ac|tion will acquire peculiar force, and gain the a&s;cendency. Thus, man will be more thought|ful and profound, as the &s;en&s;e of touch would
<PB N="29" REF="46">
appear to be more calm and intimate; the quadrupeds will have more vehement appetites; and the birds will have emotions as exten&s;ive and volatile as is the glance of &s;ight.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e, which, though it intermits, &s;eems, while it acts, to control all the others, and excites the mo&s;t powerful emo|tions, and awakens the mo&s;t ardent affections:&mdash;it is love. In quadrupeds, that appetite produces violent effects; they burn with maddening de|&s;ire; they &s;eek the female with &s;avage ardor; and they embrace with furious exta&s;y. In birds it is a &s;ofter, more tender, and more endearing pa&s;&s;ion; and, if we except tho&s;e which are de|graded by dome&s;tication, and a few other &s;pe|cies, conjugal fidelity and parental affection are among them alike con&s;picuous. The pair unite their labours in preparing for the accommodation of their expected progeny; and, during the time of incubation, their participation of the &s;ame cares and &s;olicitudes continually augments their mutual attachment. After the eggs are hatched, a new &s;ource of plea&s;ure opens to them, which further &s;trengthens the ties of affection; and the tender charge of rearing the infant brood requires the joint attention of both parents. The warmth of love is thus &s;ucceeded by calm and &s;teady attachment, which by degrees ex|tends, without &s;uffering any diminution, to the ri&s;ing branches of the family.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="47">
The quadrupeds are impelled by unbridled lu&s;t, which never &s;oftens into generous friend|&s;hip. The male abandons the female as &s;oon as the cravings of his appetite are cloyed; he re|tires to recruit his &s;trength, or ha&s;tens to the em|braces of another. The education of the young is devolved entirely on the female; and as they grow &s;lowly, and require her immediate pro|tection, the maternal tenderne&s;s is ripened into a &s;trong and durable attachment. In many &s;pe|cies the mother leads two or three litters at one time. There are &s;ome quadrupeds, however, in which the male and female a&s;&s;ociate together; &s;uch are the wolves and foxes: and the fallow|deer have been regarded as the patterns of conjugal fidelity. There are al&s;o &s;ome &s;pecies of birds where the cock &s;eparates after &s;atis|fying his pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;but &s;uch in&s;tances are rare, and do not affect the general law of na|ture.</P>
<P>That the pairing of birds is founded on the need of their mutual labours to the &s;upport of the young, appears clearly from the ca&s;e of the dome&s;tic fowls. The male ranges at will among a &s;eraglio of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive concubines; the &s;ea&s;on of love has hardly any bounds; the hatches are frequent and tedious; the eggs are often re|moved; and the female never &s;eeks to breed, until her prolific powers are deadened, and al|mo&s;t exhau&s;ted: be&s;ides, they be&s;tow little care
<PB N="31" REF="48">
in making their ne&s;t, they are abundantly &s;up|plied with provi&s;ions, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man they are freed from all tho&s;e toils and hard|&s;hips and &s;olicitudes which other birds feel and &s;hare in common. They contract the vices of luxury and opulence, <HI>indolence</HI> and <HI>de|bauchery.</HI></P>
<P>The ea&s;y comfortable condition of the do|me&s;tic fowls, and their generous food, mightily invigorate the powers of generation. A cock can tread twelve of fifteen hens, and each em|brace continues its influence for three weeks; &s;o that he may each day be the father of three hundred chickens. A good hen lays a hundred eggs between the &s;pring and autumn; but in the &s;avage &s;tate &s;he has only eighteen or twenty, and that only during a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on. The other birds indeed repeat oftener their incuba|tions, but they lay fewer eggs. The pigeons, the turtles, &amp;c. have only two; the great birds of prey three or four; and mo&s;t other birds five or &s;ix.</P>
<P>Want, anxiety, and hard labour, check in all animals the multiplication of the &s;pecies. This is particularly the ca&s;e with birds; they breed in proportion as they are well fed, and afforded ea&s;e and comfort. In the &s;tate of nature, they &s;eem even to hu&s;band their prolific powers, and to limit the number of their progeny to the pe|nury of their circum&s;tances. A bird lays five eggs, perhaps, and devotes her whole attention
<PB N="32" REF="49">
during the re&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on to the incubation and education of the young. But if the ne&s;t be de&s;troyed, &s;he &s;oon builds another, and lays three or foru eggs more; and if this be again plundered, &s;he will con&s;truct a third, and lay &s;till two or three eggs. During the fir&s;t hatch, therefore, tho&s;e internal emotions of love which occa&s;ion the growth and exclu&s;ion of the eggs, are repre&s;&s;ed. She thus &s;acrifices duty to pa&s;|&s;ion, amorous de&s;ire to parental attachment. But when her fond hopes are di&s;appointed, &s;he &s;oon cea&s;es to grieve; the procreative faculties, which were &s;u&s;pended, not extingui&s;hed, again re&s;ume their influence, and enable her in &s;ome mea&s;ure to repair her lo&s;s.</P>
<P>As love is a purer pa&s;&s;ion in birds than in quadrupeds, its mode of gratification is al&s;o &s;impler.

<P>ALL the birds almo&s;t might merit this ap|pellation, &s;ince by far the greater number &s;earch for in&s;ects, worms, and other &s;mall crea|tures; but I &s;hall confine it to tho&s;e which &s;ub|&s;i&s;t on fle&s;h, and wage perpetual war again&s;t the other winged tribes.

<PB N="38" REF="55">
which being too weak to attack other animals, prey on each other:&mdash;all the&s;e rapacious qua|dupeds exceed greatly in number the eagles, the vultures, the &s;parrow hawks, the falcons, the jer|falcons, the kites, the buzzards, the ke&s;trels, the merlins, the owls, the &s;hrikes, and the crows, which are prone to rapine: and many of the&s;e, &s;uch as the kites, the buzzards, and the crows, prefer carrion to fre&s;h prey. In &s;hort, there is only a fifteenth part of the birds carnivorous, while of the quadrupeds more than a third come under that de&s;ignation.</P>
<P>The birds of prey being much fewer and weaker than the rapacious quadrupeds, commit le&s;s depredation on land; but, as if tyranny never relinqui&s;hed its claims, whole tribes in|habit the ocean and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by their ravages. Of the quadrupeds, &s;carce any, except the beavers, the otters, the &s;eals, and the &s;ea-hor&s;es, live on fi&s;h; yet multitudes of birds derive their &s;upport entirely from that &s;ource. We have therefore to divide the birds of prey into two cla&s;&s;es, cor|re&s;ponding to the elements of air and water, which are the &s;cenes of their havocks. Tho&s;e which war again&s;t the finny race are provided with a &s;traight pointed bill; their nails are &s;lender, their toes webbed, and their legs bent backwards. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, which riot in carnage at land, and which are properly the &s;ubject of this article, are furni&s;hed with talons and with a &s;hort curved bill; their toes are parted, and
<PB N="39" REF="56">
without membranes; their legs are &s;trong, and generally covered by the feathers of the thighs; their nails large and hooked.</P>
<P>We &s;hall for the pre&s;ent &s;et a&s;ide al&s;o the noc|turnal birds of prey, and adopt what appears to be the mo&s;t natural order in treating of tho&s;e which commit their ravages during the day. We &s;hall begin with the eagles, the vultures, the kites, and the buzzards; then the hawks, the jerfalcons, and falcons; and clo&s;e with the merlins and the &s;hrikes. Many of the&s;e include a great number of &s;pecies and of permanent families produced by the influence of climate; and with each we &s;hall range the kindred foreign birds. In this way we &s;hall delineate not only tho&s;e of Europe, but al&s;o all tho&s;e which inhabit remote countries, whether de&s;cribed by authors, or procured by our corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ingular property common to all the birds of prey, but of which it would be difficult to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The final cau&s;e at lea&s;t is obvious. In the rapacious birds, the care of the brood is entru&s;ted &s;olely to the female; and Nature has wi&s;ely endowed her with greater force to enable her to provide both for her own wants and tho&s;e of her family.&mdash;Nothing but the too frequent and often puerile applications of &s;uch views of Nature could ever bring them into di&s;repute. T.</NOTE>; that the female is &s;tronger, and a third larger than the male; exactly the rever&s;e to what obtains in the quadrupeds, and even in other birds. In fi&s;hes and in&s;ects, the female is indeed larger than the male: this is
<PB N="40" REF="57">
owing to the immen&s;e number of eggs which &s;well their bodies. But this rea&s;on will not apply in the ca&s;e of birds.&mdash;In tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t prolific, &s;uch as the dome&s;tic poultry, the ducks, turkies, phea&s;ants, partridges, and quails, the hen lays eighteen or twenty eggs, and yet is &s;maller than the cock.</P>
<P>All the birds of rapine fly in a lofty cour&s;e, their wings and legs are &s;trong, their &s;ight ex|ceedingly quick, their head thick, their tongue fle&s;hy, their &s;tomach &s;ingle and membranous, their inte&s;tines narrower and &s;horter than in other birds; they prefer the &s;olitary tracts, the de&s;ert mountains, and they commonly breed in crags, or on the talle&s;t trees. Many &s;pecies in|habit both continents, and &s;ome appear to have no fixed abode. The general characters are, that their bill is hooked, and that they have four+toes on each foot, all of which are di&s;tinctly parted. But the eagle's head is covered with feathers, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from the vulture, who&s;e head is naked, and only &s;haded with &s;light down: And both the&s;e are di&s;criminated from the hawks, the buzzards, the kites, and the falcons, by an obvious property; for their bill continues &s;traight to a certain di&s;tance before it bends, but in the latter it a&s;&s;umes its curve at the origin.</P>
<P>The birds of prey are not &s;o prolific as other birds. It is &s;trange that Linnaeus &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that they lay about four eggs: for there are &s;ome, &s;uch as
<PB N="41" REF="58">
the common and &s;ea-eagles, which have only two; and others, as the ke&s;trel and merlin, that have &s;even. In birds, as in quadrupeds, the general law obtains, that the multiplication is inver&s;ely as the bulk. There are &s;ome apparent excep|tions to this rule, pigeons for in&s;tance; but the &s;mallne&s;s of the hatch will be found to be com|pen&s;ated by its frequent repetition.</P>
<P>The birds of prey are more obdurate and fe|rocious than other birds. They are not only intractable, but have the unnatural propen&s;ity to drive their tender brood from the ne&s;t. Accu&s;|tomed continually to &s;cenes of carnage, and torn by angry pa&s;&s;ions, they contract a &s;tern cruel di&s;po&s;ition; all the &s;ofter feelings are era|dicated, and maternal attachment it&s;elf is blunted. She regards not the imploring calls of her help|le&s;s young, but when &s;traitened for food, &s;he rudely thru&s;ts them upon the world, or murders them in a tran&s;port of fury.</P>
<P>This obdurate &s;elfi&s;h temper produces in the birds of prey, as well as the carnivorous qua|drupeds, another effect. They never a&s;&s;ociate together, but, like robbers, lead a roving &s;olitary life. Lu&s;t indeed draws together the male and female, and, as they can mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pur&s;uit of prey, they &s;eldom &s;eparate even after the breeding &s;ea&s;on. But the family never coale&s;ces; and the larger kinds, &s;uch as the eagle, will not &s;uffer their young to be rivals, but ex|pel them from their domain: Whereas, all birds
<PB N="42" REF="59">
and quadrupeds which &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the fruits of the earth, live in harmony with their offspring, or a&s;&s;emble joyou&s;ly in numerous troops.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to the detail of facts, we cannot avoid making &s;ome remarks on the com|mon methods of cla&s;&s;ification. The nomencla|tor &s;trives to de&s;cribe the colours of the plumage with minute preci&s;ion; he enumerates their di&s;|po&s;ition, all the &s;hades, the &s;pots, the bars, the &s;tripes, the lines; and if a bird does not come under the de&s;cription which he has thus formed he regards it as a different &s;pecies. But all ani|mals change their early garb and complexion; and the tints of the rapacious birds are won|derfully altered by the fir&s;t moulting. A &s;econd con&s;iderable one &s;ucceeds, and this is often fol|lowed by a third; &s;o that a per&s;on who &s;hould judge entirely from the colours, would imagine that a bird of &s;ix months old, another of the &s;ame kind of eighteen months, and another of two years and a half, belonged to three different &s;pecies. But the plumage is al&s;o affected by various other cau&s;es; by difference of &s;ex, of age, and of climate; and therefore the colours can never afford any permanent di&s;tinction.</P>

<HEAD>The EAGLES.</HEAD>
<P>MANY birds come under this de&s;ignation. Our nomenclators reckon eleven &s;pecies natives of Europe, be&s;ides four other, two of which are from Bra&s;il, one from Africa, and another from the Ea&s;t Indies. The&s;e eleven &s;pecies are: fir&s;t, the Common Eagle; &s;econd, the White-headed Eagle; third, the White Eagle; fourth, the Spotted Eagle; fifth, the White-tailed Eagle; &s;ixth, the Little White-tailed Eagle; &s;e|venth, the Golden Eagle; eighth, the Black Eagle; ninth, the Great Sea-eagle; tenth, the Sea-eagle; and, eleventh, the White John. Nothing is ea&s;ier than to &s;well the catalogue of names, and by a profu&s;ion of divi&s;ions and di&s;tinctions to dazzle the ignorant. We need only to wade through books, ran&s;ack cabinets, and adopt as &s;pecific characters all the differ|ences in &s;ize or colour that may occur. But the true object of the naturali&s;t is to weigh and reflect; to endeavour to &s;eize the general views, and to concentrate and arrange; and thus, by introducing order and preci&s;ion, to &s;mooth the progre&s;s of the &s;tudent.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="61">
Omitting therefore the four foreign &s;pecies of eagles, which we &s;hall con&s;ider in the &s;equel, and excluding from the li&s;t the <HI>White John,</HI> which is entirely a different bird, we may re|duce the eleven &s;pecies to &s;ix, of which there are three only that properly de&s;erve the name of Eagles. The&s;e three are: fir&s;t, the Golden Eagle; &s;econd, the Common Eagle; third, the Rough-footed Eagle. The remaining three are: fir&s;t, the <HI>Pygargue,</HI> or Bald Eagle; &s;econd, the O&s;prey; third, the Sea-eagle.</P>
<P>The Golden and Rough-footed Eagles form each an independent and unconnected &s;pecies; but the Common and Bald Eagles are &s;ubject to variety. The &s;pecies of the Common Eagle in|cludes the brown and the black. The Rough|footed Eagle contains three varieties, viz. the Great White-tailed Eagle, the Little White tailed Eagle, and the White-headed Eagle. I &s;hall not add the White Eagle, for I am confident that it owes its colour to the influence of exce&s;&s;ive cold.</P>
<P>I am induced to adopt this arrangement, both becau&s;e it was known even in the time of the ancients, that the different kinds of Eagles inter|mix, and becau&s;e it nearly coincides with the divi&s;ion marked by Ari&s;totle, who appears to have been better acquainted than any of our nomenclators with the real di&s;criminating cha|racters. He &s;ays, that there are &s;ix &s;pecies of Eagles; but among the&s;e he includes a bird, which he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es belongs rather to

It has the a&s;pect of a vulture, which has procured it the epithets of Half-eagle and Mountain Stork. This degenerate bird inhabits the fore&s;ts; it has all the bad qualities of the others, but inherits none of their generous di&s;po&s;itions, for it is beaten and driven to flight by the crow; it is lean, hungry, and gaunt; perpetually complain|ing, noi&s;y, and clamorous.</NOTE>, and which we mu&s;t therefore &s;et a&s;ide. Of the five remaining ones, the three fir&s;t are the &s;ame with tho&s;e on which I have fixed; and the fourth and fifth corre&s;pond to the Bald Eagle and the O&s;prey.

<P>THE fir&s;t &s;pecies is the Golden Eagle, which Belon named, after Athenaeus, the <HI>Royal Eagle,</HI> or the <HI>King of Birds.</HI> This is indeed an eagle of a noble family and of an indepen|dent race. Hence Ari&s;totle denominates it <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> (<HI>the Eagle of Birth</HI>), and our nomen|clators have named it the <HI>Golden Eagle:</HI> It is the large&s;t of the genus. The female mea&s;ures, from the point of the bill to the extremity of the feet, more than three feet and an half; the wings, when expanded, extend above eight feet, and it weighs &s;ixteen or eighteen pounds. The male is &s;maller and does not weigh more than twelve. In both, the bill is very &s;trong, and re&s;embles blui&s;h horn; the claws are black and pointed, and the one placed behind, which is the large&s;t, is &s;ometimes five inches long: the eyes are large, but &s;unk in a

the &s;uperior part of the orbit: the iris is of a fine bright yellow, and
&s;parkles with dazzling fire; the vitreous humour is of a topaz colour; the
cry&s;talline lens, which is dry and &s;olid, has the lu&s;tre and brilliancy
of the diamond: the oe&s;ophagus dilates into a large bag, which is capable of
containing a pint: the &s;tomach, which is under this, is not near &s;o large,
but is equally pliant and membranous. The bird is plump, e&s;pecially in
winter. The fat is white, and the fle&s;h, though hard and fibrous, has not
that wild flavour common to birds of prey.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies inhabits Greece, the mountains of Bugey in France, tho&s;e of Sile&s;ia in Germany, the fore&s;ts of Dantzic, the &s;ummits of the Car|pathian mountains, the Pyrenees, and the moun|tains of Ireland. It is found al&s;o in A&s;ia Minor, and in Per&s;ia; for the Per&s;ians had, before the Romans, a&s;&s;umed the eagle as the &s;tandard of war; and it was this great eagle, this golden eagle, <HI>aquila fulva,</HI> which was con&s;ecrated to Jupiter. The te&s;timony of travellers a&s;certains its exi&s;tence in Arabia, in Mauritania, and in many other provinces of Africa and A&s;ia, as far as Tartary; but it has not been di&s;covered in Siberia, or in any other part of the north of A&s;ia. The &s;ame remark may be extended to Europe. For this noble bird, which is every where rare, is more frequent in the warm re|gions than in the temperate countries, and it is
<PB N="48" REF="66">
&s;eldom ob&s;erved to penetrate farther north|wards than the latitude of fifty-five degrees. Nor is it found in North America, though the common eagle is an inhabitant of that part of the globe. The Golden Eagle &s;eems to have continued its ancient re&s;idence; like the other animals, which, being unable to &s;upport an in|ten&s;e cold, could not migrate into the new world.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal points, both phy&s;ical and moral, in which the eagle re&s;embles the lion. Both are alike di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;trength; and hence the eagle extends his dominion over the birds, as the lion over the quadrupeds. Magnanimity is equally con&s;picuous in both; they de&s;pi&s;e the &s;mall animals, and di&s;regard their in&s;ults. It is only after a &s;eries of provocations, after being teazed with the noi&s;y and har&s;h notes of the raven or magpie, that the eagle is deter|mined to puni&s;h their temerity or their in&s;olence with death. Be&s;ides, both di&s;dain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that property which is not the fruit of their own indu&s;try; and they reject with contempt the prey which is not procured by their own exertions. Both are remarkable for their tem|perance. The eagle &s;eldom devours the whole of his game, but, like the lion, leaves the frag|ments and offals to the other animals. Though fami&s;hed for want of prey, he di&s;dains to feed upon carrion. Like the lion al&s;o, he is &s;olitary, the inhabitant of a de&s;ert, over which he reigns

&s;upreme, and excludes all the other birds from his &s;ilent domain. It is more uncommon per|haps to &s;ee two pairs of eagles in the &s;ame tract of the mountain, than two families of lions in the &s;ame part of the fore&s;t. They &s;eparate from each other at &s;uch wide intervals, as to afford ample range for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and e&s;teem the value and extent of their kingdom to con&s;i&s;t in the abundance of the prey with which it is re|pleni&s;hed. The eyes of the eagle have the glare of tho&s;e of the lion, and are nearly of the &s;ame colour; the claws of the &s;ame &s;hape, the organs of &s;ound are equally powerful, and the cry is equally terrible. De&s;tined both of them for war and plunder, they are equally fierce, equally bold, and intractable. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tame them, unle&s;s they be caught when in their in|fancy. It requires much patience and art to train a young eagle for the chace; and, after he has attained to age and &s;trength, his caprices and momentary impul&s;es of pa&s;&s;ion are &s;ufficient to create &s;u&s;picions and fears in his ma&s;ter. Authors inform us, that the eagle was anciently u&s;ed in the ea&s;t for falconry, but this practice is now laid a&s;ide. He is too heavy to be carried on the hand without great fatigue, nor is he ever brought to be &s;o tame or &s;o gentle, as to remove all &s;u&s;picions of danger. His bill and claws are crooked and formidable: his figure corre&s;ponds to his in&s;tinct. His body is robu&s;t; his legs and wings &s;trong; his fle&s;h hard; his
<PB N="50" REF="68">
bones firm; his feathers &s;tiff; his attitude bold and erect; his movements quick; his flight rapid. He ri&s;es higher in the air than any of the winged race, and hence he was termed by the ancients the <HI>Cele&s;tial Bird,</HI> and regarded. in their auguries, as the me&s;&s;enger of Jupiter. He can di&s;tingui&s;h objects at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, but his &s;mell is inferior to that of the vulture. By means of his exqui&s;ite &s;ight, he pur&s;ues his prey, and, when he has &s;eized it, he checks his flight, and places it upon the ground, to examine its weight, before he carries it off. Though his wings be vigorous, yet his legs being &s;tiff, it is with difficulty that he can ri&s;e, e&s;pecially if he is loaded. He bears away gee&s;e and cranes with ea&s;e; he al&s;o carries off hares, young lambs and kids. When he attacks fawns or calves, he in&s;tantly gluts him&s;elf with their blood and fle&s;h, and afterwards tran&s;ports the mangled carca&s;es to his <HI>eyry</HI> or <HI>airy,</HI> (&s;o his ne&s;t is called,) which is quite flat, and not hollow like that of other birds. He commonly places it between two rocks, in a dry inacce&s;&s;ible place. The &s;ame ne&s;t, it is &s;aid, &s;erves the eagle for the whole cour&s;e of his life. It is indeed a work labori|ous enough not to be repeated, and &s;olid enough to la&s;t for a con&s;iderable time. It is con&s;tructed nearly like a floor, with &s;mall &s;ticks, five or &s;ix inches long, &s;upported at the extremities, and cro&s;&s;ed with pliant branches, covered with &s;everal layers of ru&s;hes and heath: the ne&s;t is &s;everal
<PB N="51" REF="69">
feet broad, and &s;o firm, as not only to receive the eagle, the female, and the young, but to bear the weight of a large quantity of provi&s;ions. It is not covered above, but is &s;heltered by the projection of the upper part of the rock. In the middle of this &s;tructure, the female depo&s;ites her eggs, which &s;eldom exceed two or three, and covers them, it is &s;aid, for thirty days; but &s;ome of the&s;e are commonly addle, and it is &s;eldom that three young eagles are found in a &s;ingle ne&s;t. It is even pretended, that after they have acquired &s;ome &s;trength, the mother de&s;troys the weake&s;t or the mo&s;t voracious of her infant brood. Exce&s;&s;ive &s;carcity of provi&s;ions alone can occa&s;ion this unnatural treatment. The parents, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ufficiency for their own &s;upport, endeavour to reduce the members of their family; and when the young are able to fly, and in &s;ome degree to provide for them&s;elves, they expel them from their natal abode, and never &s;uffer them to return.</P>
<P>The plumage is not of &s;o deep a ca&s;t in the young eagles as in tho&s;e that are full grown. At fir&s;t it is white, then a faint yellow, and afterwards it becomes a bright copper colour. Age, as well as gluttony, di&s;ea&s;e, and captivity, contributes to render them white. It is &s;aid they live above a century, and that their death is not occa&s;ioned &s;o much by extreme age, as by the inability to take food, the bill growing &s;o much
<PB N="52" REF="70">
curved as to become u&s;ele&s;s. However, it has been ob&s;erved, that eagles kept in confinement occa&s;ionally &s;harpen their bill, and that its in|crea&s;e is, for &s;everal years, imperceptible. It has al&s;o been remarked, that they feed upon every kind of fle&s;h, and even upon that of other eagles. When they cannot procure fle&s;h, they greedily devour bread, &s;erpents, lizards, &amp;c. If they be not &s;upplied with food, they bite cruelly the cats, dogs, and men that come within their reach. At intervals, they pour forth in an equable &s;train their &s;hrill, loud, and lamentable notes.&mdash;The eagle drinks &s;eldom, and perhaps not at all when in perfect liberty, becau&s;e the blood of his victims are &s;ufficient to quench his thir&s;t. His excrements are always &s;oft, and more watery than tho&s;e of the other birds, even tho&s;e which drink frequently.</P>
<P>To this great &s;pecies we mu&s;t refer the ac|count in the pa&s;&s;age of Leo Africanus which we have already quoted, and what travellers in Africa and A&s;ia relate, who agree in a&s;&s;erting that this bird not only carries off kids and young deer, but when taught, that it will even attack foxes and wolves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Emperor of Thibet has &s;everal tame eagles, which are &s;o keen and fierce, that they &s;eize hares, bucks, does, and foxes; and there are &s;ome &s;o extremely bold, that they ru&s;h impetuou&s;ly upon the wolf, and hara&s;s him &s;o much that he can be more ea&s;ily caught. <BIBL>MARCO POLO.</BIBL></NOTE>.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus refers the eagles to the genus of the falcon.

<P>THIS &s;pecies of eagle is not &s;o pure or ge|nerous as the Golden Eagle. It is com|po&s;ed of two varieties; the brown-eagle, and the black eagle. Ari&s;totle has not di&s;tingui&s;hed them by name; and it appears that he cla&s;&s;ed them under the denomination of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; that is, black or blacki&s;h eagle. He properly &s;eparates this &s;pecies from the preceding, becau&s;e it differs: 1. in &s;ize; the Ring-tail Eagle, whe|ther black or brown, being &s;maller than the Golden Eagle: 2. by the colours, which are con|&s;tant in the Golden Eagle, but vary in the Ring|tail Eagle: 3. by its cry, the Golden Eagle utter|ing often a doleful plaint, while the Ring-tail Eagle, black or brown, &s;eldom &s;creams: 4. by its natural di&s;po&s;itions; the Ring-tail Eagle feed|ing
<PB N="55" REF="73">
all its young in the ne&s;t, training them, and conducting them to prey after they are partly grown; while the Golden Eagle drives them out of its airy, and abandons them as &s;oon as they are able to fly.</P>
<P>It appears ea&s;y to prove that the Brown and Black Eagle, which I have cla&s;&s;ed together, do not really con&s;titute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies. We need only compare them together, even from the characters given by nomenclators with the view of di&s;tingui&s;hing them. They are both nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize; they are of the &s;ame brown colour, only &s;ometimes of a deeper &s;hade; in both, the upper part of the head and neck is tinged with ferruginous, and the ba&s;e of the large feathers marked with white; the legs and feet are alike clothed; in both, the iris is of a hazel colour, the cere of a bright yellow, the bill that of blui&s;h horn, the toes yellow, and the talons black: in &s;hort, the whole difference con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;hades and di&s;tribution of the colour of the feathers; which is by no means &s;ufficient to con|&s;titute two different &s;pecies, e&s;pecially when the number of the points of re&s;emblance &s;o evidently exceeds that of the difference. I have therefore without &s;cruple reduced the&s;e two &s;pecies to one. Ari&s;totle has done the &s;ame thing without men|tioning it; but it appears that his tran&s;lator, Theodore Gaza, perceived it; for he does not render <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> by <HI>Aquila nigra,</HI> but by <HI>Aquila nigricans, pulla fulvia,</HI> which includes the
<PB N="56" REF="74">
two varieties of this &s;pecies, both of which are blacki&s;h, but the one of which is more tinged with yellow than the other. Ari&s;totle, who&s;e accuracy I often admire, gives names and epi|thets to the animals which he mentions. The epithet of this bird is <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or the <HI>de&s;troyer of hares.</HI> In fact, though the other eagles al&s;o prey upon hares, this &s;pecies is a more fatal enemy to tho&s;e timid animals, which are the con&s;tant object of their &s;earch, and the prey which they prefer. The Latins, after Pliny, termed this eagle <HI>Valeria, qua&s;i valens viribus,</HI> becau&s;e of its &s;trength, which appears greater than that of the other eagles in proportion to the &s;ize.</P>
<P>The Ring-tail Eagle is more numerous and &s;pread than the Golden Eagle. The latter is found only in the warm and temperate countries of the ancient continent; the former prefers the cold tracts, and inhabitants of both continents. It occurs in France, Savoy, Switzerland, Ger|many, Poland, Scotland, and even in North America, at Hud&s;on's Bay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ellis tells us, that about Hud&s;on's Bay there are many other birds remarkable for their &s;hape and &s;trength: &s;uch as the White|tailed Eagle, which is nearly of the &s;ize of a turkey-cock; its crown flattened, its neck &s;hort, its brea&s;t large, its thighs &s;trong, and its wings very long and broad in proportion to its body; they are blacki&s;h behind, but al&s;o of a lighter colour on the &s;ides; the brea&s;t is marked with white, the wing feathers are black; the tail when clo&s;ed is white above and below, except the tips of the feathers, which are black or brown; the thighs are covered with blacki&s;h brown feathers, through which in &s;ome places the white down appears; the legs are covered to the feet with a brown, or &s;omewhat reddi&s;h plumage; each foot has four thick &s;trong toes, three before and one behind; they are covered with yellow &s;cales, and furni&s;hed with nails that are exceedingly &s;trong and &s;harp, and of a &s;hining black.</NOTE>.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;pecific character given by Linnaeus of the Ring-tail Eagle <HI>(Falco fulvus)</HI> is, <Q REND="inline">That its cere is yellow; its feet woolly and dull ru&s;t-coloured; and its tail marked with a white ring.</Q> The brown &s;ort was &s;tated in the roth edition of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae</HI> as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, by the name of <HI>Falco Canaden&s;is,</HI> and de&s;cribed as <Q REND="inline">having a yellow cere, its feet woolly, its body du&s;ky-coloured, its tail white, and tipt with brown.</Q> In the 12th and &s;ub&s;equent editions, however, it is con&s;idered as merely a variety. It builds its ne&s;t in the lofty cliffs. The &s;paces between its eyes and its ears are naked. Its brea&s;t is &s;prinkled with triangular &s;pots.</P> 
<P>We may remark, that both Linnaeus and Pennant conceive, that Marco Polo, in his De&s;cription of the U&s;ages of the Tartars, alludes to this &s;pecies, and not to the Golden Eagle, as Buffon &s;uppo&s;es.</P> 
<P>The Black Eagle, termed by Fri&s;ch, <HI>Schwartz-braune Adler</HI> (Black|brown Eagle), which Buffon ranges with the Ring-tail Eagle, is reckoned a different &s;pecies by Linnaeus, under the name of <HI>Falco Melanaeetus.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its cere is yellowi&s;h, its feet partly woolly, its body black-ferruginous, with yellow &s;treaks.</Q> It is two feet ten inches long.

<P>THE third &s;pecies is the Rough-footed Eagle, which Ari&s;totle de&s;cribes as a plaintive bird, with a &s;potted plumage, and &s;maller and weaker than the other eagles.

pre&s;ume that the bird called the Oronooko Eagle, which bears &s;ome
re&s;emblance to this in the variety of its plumage, is yet of a different
&s;pecies.&mdash;If this Rough-footed Eagle, which is much more docile, and
more ea&s;ily tamed than the other two, and which is al&s;o lighter on the
hand, and le&s;s dangerous to its ma&s;ter, were equally intrepid, it would
have been employed for the purpo&s;es of falconry. But it is as cow|ardly as it
is plaintive and noi&s;y. A well-trained &s;parrow-hawk can attack it, and come
off vic|torious. <PB N="60" REF="78"> Be&s;ides, our authors on the &s;ubject
of falconry inform us, that, in France at lea&s;t, the two fir&s;t &s;pecies of
eagles only have been trained for &s;port<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> To this
&s;pecies we may refer the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q REND="inline">There are eagles al&s;o in
the mountains near Tauris, in Per&s;ia; I have &s;een one &s;old for five
halfpence by the pea&s;ants. People of rank cha&s;e this bird with the
&s;parrow-hawk. This &s;port is &s;omewhat curious and extraordinary. The
&s;parrow-hawk flies high above the eagle, darts rapidly upon him, fixes its
talons in his &s;ides, and continuing to fly beats his head with its wings. It
&s;ometimes happens that both fall together.</Q></NOTE>. To &s;ucceed in teaching
them, they mu&s;t be taken when young, for an adult eagle is not only
&s;tubborn, but quite intractable. They mu&s;t be fed upon the fle&s;h of the
game which they are intended to pur&s;ue. Their education requires more
watchful attention than that of the other birds employed in falconry.&mdash;We
&s;hall give a &s;ketch of that art when we treat of the falcon. I &s;hall only
mention here &s;ome peculi|arities which have been ob&s;erved with regard to
eagles, whether in the &s;tate of liberty, or in that of dome&s;tication.</P>
<P>The female, which in the eagle as in all other birds of prey is larger than the male, and al&s;o &s;eems in the &s;tate of nature to be bolder, more intrepid, and more &s;ubtle, appears to lo&s;e its courage and &s;agacity when reduced to cap|tivity. The males are preferred for &s;port; and it is ob&s;erved that, in the &s;pring, when the &s;ea&s;on of love returns, they endeavour to e&s;cape to their females. And if we employ them dur|ing
<PB N="61" REF="79">
this critical period, we run a ri&s;k of lo&s;ing them, unle&s;s we cool the ardour of their pa&s;&s;ion by admini&s;tering violent purges. It has al&s;o been remarked, that when an eagle, after leaving the hand, &s;kims along the ground, and afterwards ri&s;es perpendicularly, he meditates an e&s;cape. He mu&s;t in&s;tantly be &s;olicited to return, by throw|ing him food. But if flies wheeling above his keeper, and does not &s;tretch to a di&s;tance, it is a &s;ign of his attachment and con&s;tancy. It has been ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that an eagle trained for &s;port, lo&s;ing its original in&s;tinct, often attacks and devours the gos-hawk and other &s;mall birds of prey; but in the &s;tate of nature, it only contends with them, or plunders them, as rivals.</P>
<P>In the &s;tate of nature, the eagle never en|gages in a &s;olitary chace but when the female is confined to her eggs or her young. This is the &s;ea&s;on when the return of the birds affords plenty of prey, and he can with ea&s;e provide for the &s;u&s;tenance of him&s;elf, and that of his mate. At other times, they unite their exertions, and they are always &s;een clo&s;e together, or at a &s;hort di&s;tance from each other. The inhabitants of the mountains, who have an opportunity of ob&s;erving their manoeuvres, pretend, that the one beats the bu&s;hes, while the other, perched on a tree or a rock, watches the e&s;cape of the prey. Often they &s;oar beyond the reach of human &s;ight, and notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="62" REF="80">
immen&s;e di&s;tance, their cry is &s;till heard, and then re&s;embles the barking of a &s;mall dog. Though a voracious bird, the eagle, e&s;pecially in captivity and deprived of exerci&s;e, can endure for a long time the want of &s;u&s;te|nance. I have been informed by a man of veracity, that a common eagle caught in a fox|trap, pa&s;&s;ed five whole weeks without the lea&s;t food, and that it did not appear &s;en&s;ibly weak|ened till towards the la&s;t week, after which they killed it, to put an end to its lingering pain.</P>
<P>Though the eagles in general prefer de&s;ert and mountainous tracts, they are &s;eldom found in narrow penin&s;ulas, or in i&s;lands of &s;mall extent. They inhabit the interior country in both continents, becau&s;e i&s;lands are commonly not &s;o well &s;tocked with animals. The antients remarked that eagles were never &s;een in the i&s;le of Rhodes, and con&s;idered it as a prodigy, that when the Emperor Tiberius vi&s;ited that famous &s;pot, an eagle perched upon the hou&s;e where he lodged. Eagles make excur&s;ions into i&s;lands, but do not fix their re&s;idence there, or lay their eggs; and when travellers &s;peak of eagles, who&s;e ne&s;ts they find on the &s;ea-&s;hore or in i&s;lands, they mean not tho&s;e which we have mentioned, but the O&s;preys, commonly termed <HI>Sea-eagles,</HI> which are birds of a different in&s;tinct, and which feed on fi&s;h rather than on game.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="81">
I ought here to relate the anatomical ob&s;erva|tions that have been made on the internal &s;truc|ture of eagles; and I cannot draw my informa|tion from a better &s;ource than the Memoirs of tho&s;e Gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences who di&s;&s;ected two eagles, a male and a female, of the common &s;pecies.

The difference between the Ernes and the Eagles con&s;i&s;ts, Fir&s;t, In the want of plumage on the legs; the Eagles are clothed as far as the pounces; but the Ernes are naked in all the lower part. Secondly, In the colour of the bill; in the Eagles, it is of a blui&s;h black; in the Ernes, it is yellow or white. Thirdly, In the whitene&s;s of the tail; which circum&s;tance has given ri&s;e to the name which the Erne has &s;ometimes received of <HI>White-tailed Eagle.</HI> In fact, the tail is white both in the upper and un|der &s;ide through its whole length. They differ from the Eagles al&s;o in their in&s;tincts and ha|bits. They fix their re&s;idence not in de&s;erts, or lofty mountains; they haunt the plains or woods that are near the habitations of men. The Erne appears to &s;hew, like the Common Eagle, a preference to cold countries. It is found in all the northern kingdoms of Europe. The Great Erne is of the &s;ame &s;ize and the &s;ame &s;trength, if not more vigorous, than the Common Eagle: it is at lea&s;t more bloody and ferocious, and le&s;s at|tached to its young; for it feeds them but a &s;hort time, drives them from its ne&s;t before they can procure &s;u&s;tenance; and it is pretended that, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the O&s;prey, which generally takes them under its protection, they would peri&s;h. It has commonly two or three young, and builds its ne&s;t upon large trees. A de&s;cription of one of the&s;e ne&s;ts occurs in Wil|loughby, and in &s;everal other authors who have
<PB N="67" REF="85">
copied it. It is an airy, or floor quite flat, like that of the Great Eagle, &s;heltered above by the foliage of trees, and formed with &s;mall &s;ticks and branches, which are covered with &s;everal alternate layers of broom, and other plants. That unnatural di&s;po&s;ition which in&s;tigates tho&s;e birds to expel their young before their feeble &s;trength is able to procure an ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and which is common to the Erne, the Golden Eagle, and the Spotted Rough-footed Eagle, proves that the&s;e three &s;pecies are more vora|cious, and more inactive in the pur&s;uit of their prey, than the Ring-tail Eagle, which watches and feeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The o&s;&s;ifraga feeds carefully both its own young and tho&s;e of the eagle; for when it ejects them from the ne&s;t, this bird re|ceives them, and breeds them.

In this forlorn &s;tate, the o&s;&s;ifraga li&s;tens to their complaints, and kindly takes them under its protec|tion.</Q> <BIBL>ARIST. <HI>Hi&s;t.

them to hunt, and does not de&s;ert them till their dexterity and vi|gour are
&s;ufficient for their &s;upport. The young al&s;o inherit the in&s;tinct of
their parents. The Eaglets of the common kind are gentle and peaceful; but
tho&s;e of the Golden Eagle and the Erne, as &s;oon as they have acquired
&s;ome &s;tature, are continually fighting and contending about their food, and
their place in the ne&s;t: &s;o that the father and mother, to terminate the
quarrel, often de&s;troy a mutinous &s;ubject. The Golden Eagle and the Erne
generally point <PB N="68" REF="86"> their attacks upon large animals; they
often &s;atiate them&s;elves upon the &s;pot, being unable to tran&s;port their
prey: hence their depre|dations are le&s;s frequent, and, not pre&s;erving
carrion in their ne&s;t, they are often reduced duced to want. On the other
hand, the Com|mon Eagle, which catches every day hares and birds, &s;upplies
more ea&s;ily and more plentifully the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to its
young. It has al&s;o been remarked, e&s;pecially with regard to the Ernes,
which chu&s;e their haunt near &s;ettled &s;pots, that they &s;earch for their
prey only du|ring a few hours in the middle of the day, and devote the morning,
the evening, and the night to &s;leep; whereas the Common Eagle <HI>(Aquila

habits are as different as its appetites; for it feeds chiefly on fi&s;h, which
it catches in the water, and even &s;everal feet below the &s;urface<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> Ari&s;totle, however, ranks the O&s;prey among the
eagles:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">The fifth &s;pecies of eagles is the <HI>Haliaetus</HI> or
<HI>Sea-Eagle</HI>; its neck large and thick, its wings curved, its tail broad.
It haunts the &s;hores. When it is unable to carry its prey, it often plunges
it into the water.</Q> We mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the Greeks cla&s;&s;ed the
rapacious birds into three kinds; the Eagle, the Vulture, and the Hawk. This
explains the arrangement which Ari&s;totle has here adopted. But it is
&s;omewhat &s;ingular, that Ray, who is otherwi&s;e an intelligent and accurate
writer, &s;hould affirm that the <HI>O&s;&s;ifraga</HI> and the
<HI>Haliaetus</HI> are the &s;ame; &s;ince Ari&s;totle di&s;tin|gui&s;hes them,
and treats of them in two &s;eparate chapters. The only rea&s;on which Ray
could urge, is the &s;mallne&s;s of the O&s;prey or Bald-Buzzard; but the
&s;ame rea&s;on would al&s;o exclude the <HI>Morph|nus</HI> from the
eagles.</NOTE>. And that this is its ordinary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence appears,
becau&s;e its fle&s;h has a &s;trong fi&s;hy flavour. I &s;ometimes ob&s;erved
this bird remain more than an hour perched upon a tree contiguous to a pool,
watching the appearance of a large fi&s;h, and ready to dart upon it and
tran&s;port the victim in its talons. Its legs are naked and commonly of a
blui&s;h colour; in &s;ome indivi|duals, however, the legs and feet are
yellowi&s;h, the claws large and &s;harp, the feet and toes &s;o &s;tiff that
they cannot be bent; the belly is entirely white, the tail broad, and the head
thick and bulky. It differs from the eagles, becau&s;e its feet and the lower
part of its legs are not feathered, and its hind pounce is the &s;horte&s;t; 
<PB N="72" REF="91"> while in the eagles, that is the longe&s;t of all. It is
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the eagle by another circum&s;tance; for its bill is of
a deeper black, and the feet, the toes, and the cere are commonly blue, while
tho&s;e of the eagle are yellow. The toes of the left foot are not connected by
&s;emi|membranes, as Linnaeus a&s;&s;erts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus has
omitted this account in the later editions [a].</NOTE>; for the toes of both
legs are alike parted and devoid of membranes. It is a popular error, that this
bird &s;wims with the one foot, and catches fi&s;h with the other; and this has
occa&s;ioned the mi&s;take of Linnaeus. Formerly Klein affirmed the &s;ame
thing of the Great Sea-eagle, but he was equally mi&s;taken; for neither of
the&s;e birds has mem|branes connecting the toes of the left foot. The common
&s;ource of the&s;e errors is Albertus Mag|nus, who writes, that this bird had
one foot like that of the &s;parrow-hawk, and the other re|&s;embling that of
the goo&s;e; an a&s;&s;ertion which is not only fal&s;e, but ab&s;urd and
incon&s;i&s;tent with every analogy. It is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing, that
Ge&s;ner, Aldrovandus, Klein, and Linnaeus, in&s;tead of rejecting this &s;illy
fable, have blindly adopted it; and that Aldrovandus tells us coolly, that it
is not improbable, &s;ince he po&s;itively adds, he knows there are &s;everal
water-fowls who&s;e feet are half-cloven, half-webbed; an a&s;|&s;ertion as
fal&s;e as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="92">
I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that Ari&s;totle called this bird <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Sea-Eagle; but I am a&s;toni&s;hed that all the naturali&s;ts, ancient or modern, have copied the name without &s;cruple, and I might &s;ay without reflexion; for this bird frequents the &s;ea-&s;hore not from any decided preference. It oftener haunts inland countries that are con|tiguous to rivers, lakes, and other fre&s;h waters; and it is even more common in Burgundy, which is the centre of France, than on any of our coa&s;ts. As Greece is a country which has few rivers, pools, or lakes, and which is much in|ter&s;ected and indented by the incroachment or retreat of the ocean, Ari&s;totle ob&s;erved that the&s;e bird-fi&s;hers &s;ought their prey on the beach, and for this rea&s;on he named them <HI>Sea-Eagles.</HI> But had this philo&s;opher lived in the heart of France, Germany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">This bird is exceedingly fat, and is entirely of a fi&s;hy odor.

&s;ea; and where the&s;e birds are common, he would probably have termed them
<HI>fre&s;h-water-eagles.</HI> Ari&s;totle affirms, that this bird has a keen
&s;ight; it compels its young, he &s;ays, to look at the &s;un, and kills
tho&s;e who&s;e eyes cannot &s;upport the glare. I cannot authen|ticate this
fact, which appears to me rather <PB N="74" REF="93"> improbable, though it has
been related or rather repeated by &s;everal authors; and though it has even
been generalized and attributed to all the eagles, which are &s;aid to force
their brood to look &s;teadily at the &s;un. This is an ob&s;ervation which it
would be difficult to make; and Ari&s;totle was be&s;ides not much acquainted
with the facts re|lating to the young of this bird. He alleges that they rear
only two, and kill that one who&s;e eyes cannot bear the dazzling rays of the
&s;un. But we are certain that they often lay four eggs, and &s;eldom three
only, and that they rai&s;e all which are hatched. In&s;tead of inhabiting
rocky precipices and lofty mountains, as do the eagles, it prefers the haunts
of low and mar&s;hy grounds, in the vicinity of pools and lakes that abound
with fi&s;h. It appears that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe to the <HI>O&s;prey,</HI> and
not to the <HI>Sea-Eagle,</HI> what Ari&s;totle mentions with regard to the
pur&s;uit of &s;ea-birds; for the Sea-eagle fi&s;hes rather than hunts; nor
have I heard that it &s;trays to a di&s;tance from the beach in the chace of
gulls and other &s;ea-birds: on the contrary, it &s;eems to &s;ub&s;i&s;t
entirely upon fi&s;h. Tho&s;e who have di&s;|&s;ected this bird, have found
nothing but fi&s;h in its &s;tomach; and its fle&s;h, which, as I have &s;aid,
has a very &s;trong &s;mell of fi&s;h, is a &s;ufficient proof that this
con&s;titutes its ordinary food. It is com|monly very fat, and can, like the
eagles, &s;upport for &s;everal days the want of &s;u&s;tenance, without
&s;uffering inconvenience or lo&s;s of &s;trength. It <PB N="75" REF="94"> is
not &s;o bold or &s;o ferocious as the eagle or erne; and it is pretended that
it could be as ea&s;ily in|&s;tructed for fi&s;hing, as the other birds are
trained for the &s;port.</P>
<P>After comparing authorities, I am of opinion that this &s;pecies is one of the mo&s;t numerous of the large birds of prey; and is &s;cattered over the extent of Europe, from Sweden to Greece; and that it is even found in warmer countries, as in Egypt and Nigritia.</P>
<P>The internal parts of this bird differ little from tho&s;e of the eagles. The academicians have per|ceived the mo&s;t con&s;iderable di&s;tinction in the liver, which in the Sea-eagle is very &s;mall. The <HI>caecum</HI> of the female al&s;o is not &s;o large; and the &s;pleen, which in the eagle is clo&s;ely attached to the right &s;ide of the &s;tomach, is in this bird placed under the right lobe of the liver.

<P>THIS bird has been called by our nomencla|tors, the <HI>Great Sea-Eagle.</HI> It is indeed nearly as large as the Golden Eagle; and its body &s;eems proportionally longer, though its wings be &s;horter. It mea&s;ures, from the end of the bill to the point of the nails, three feet and an half; but its expanded wings do not reach above &s;even feet: whereas the length of the Golden Eagle is generally only three feet two or three inches, and the exten&s;ion of its wings eight or nine feet.

By its legs, which are naked below, and covered with &s;mall yellow &s;cales. 3. By the beard of feathers which hangs from the chin, and which has occa&s;ioned its receiving the name of <HI>Bearded-Eagle.</HI> The Sea-Eagle loves to haunt the &s;ea-&s;hore, and often frequents inland
<PB REF="96">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>N^o 3. THE SEA EAGLE</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="77" REF="97"> tracts, nearlakes, mar&s;hes, or rivers that are
&s;tocked with fi&s;h. It catches the large&s;t of the finny tribe; but it
al&s;o attacks game, and, as it is large and &s;trong, it &s;eizes and carries
off gee&s;e and hares, and even lambs and kids. Ari&s;totle a&s;&s;ures us,
that the female Sea-Eagle not only watches her infant brood with the greate&s;t
affection, but extends her protection to the young eaglets, which have been
expelled by their unfeeling parents, and generally feeds and trains them as if
they were her own offspring. This &s;ingular fact has been repeated by all the
naturali&s;ts, but it does not appear to be authenticated. We have rea&s;on
however to admire the general ac|curacy of his Hi&s;tory of Animals. We have a
remarkable proof of this in point:&mdash;Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves, that the
&s;ight of the Sea-Eagle is weak, on account of a &s;hade which covers the eye;
and hence he was probably induced to &s;eparate it from the eagles, and cla&s;s
it with the owls and night birds. To judge of this fact by the con&s;equences,
we &s;hould infer, that it is not only doubtful, but fal&s;e; for all who have
watched the manoeuvres of the Sea-Eagle, have found that it &s;ees during the
night &s;o di&s;tinctly as to be able to catch game, and even fi&s;h; but they
have not ob&s;erved that its &s;ight was feeble during the day. On the
contrary, it perceives at a great di&s;tance, the fi&s;h upon which it is to
dart; it pur&s;ues with eagerne&s;s the birds on which it is to prey; and
though it flies with le&s;s rapidity <PB N="78" REF="98"> than the eagles, this
is owing to the &s;hortne&s;s of its wings, and not the indi&s;tinctne&s;s of
its vi|&s;ion. A re&s;pect for the great philo&s;opher of antiquity has induced
the celebrated Aldrovandus to examine the eye of the Sea-Eagle with mi|nute
attention; and he has di&s;covered that the aperture of the pupil, which is
commonly cover|ed only with the cornea, is in this bird lined be&s;ides with an
exceedingly delicate membrane, which has actually the appearance of a &s;mall
&s;pot. He al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the inconvenience of this &s;tructure is
compen&s;ated by the perfect tran&s;parency of the circular part &s;urrounding
the pupil, which ring in other birds is opaque and of a dull colour. Thus the
ob&s;ervation of Ari&s;totle is good, &s;ince he has remarked that the eye of
the Sea-Eagle is covered with a thin cloud; but it does not nece&s;&s;arily
follow, that its &s;ight is fainter than that of other birds, becau&s;e the
light can pa&s;s ea&s;ily and largely through the &s;mall circle which bounds
the pupil; all that can be inferred is, that the middle of the pic|ture mu&s;t
be marked with a &s;mall ob&s;cure &s;pot, and that the lateral vi&s;ion ought
to be more di&s;tinct than the direct. It is not however mani|fe&s;t from what
has been &s;aid, that it &s;ees wor&s;e than the other birds. It &s;oars not
indeed to the &s;ame height as the eagle, nor flies with equal rapidity; nor
does it de&s;cry or pur&s;ue its prey from &s;o remote di&s;tances. It is
probable, there|fore, that the &s;ight of the O&s;prey is not &s;o acute 
<PB N="79" REF="99"> or di&s;tinct as that of the eagle; at the &s;ame time it

informed by per&s;ons who ob&s;erved the fact, that the Sea-Eagle catches
fi&s;h during the night, and that the noi&s;e of its plunging into the water is
heard at a great di&s;tance. Salerne al&s;o remarks, that when it darts into a
pool to &s;eize its prey, the noi&s;e it occa&s;ions is terrible, e&s;pecially
in the night.</NOTE>, particularly in the mornings and evenings. Be&s;ides, if
we compare the eye of the Sea-Eagle with that of the owl and other nocturnal
birds, we &s;hall perceive a dif|ference of &s;tructure. In the day-time
the&s;e birds &s;ee faintly, if at all; their delicate organs being unable to
bear the &s;hock of a blaze of light; their pupil is entirely open, and not
lined with that membrane or &s;mall &s;pot, which is found in the eye of the
Sea-Eagle. The pupil in all nocturnal birds, cats, and &s;ome other quadrupeds,
which &s;ee in the dark, is round and large, when it receives the
impre&s;&s;ion of a faint light in the du&s;k of the evening. On the contrary,
it be|comes elongated in cats, but in the nocturnal birds, it retains its
globular figure, though it contracts its &s;ize, when the eye is expo&s;ed to a
&s;trong glare. This contraction evidently proves that the&s;e birds &s;ee
<HI>ill,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;ee too <HI>well</HI>; &s;ince their delicate
organs are &s;en&s;ible to the fainte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Wherefore,
<HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> the Sea-Eagle, with its &s;pot upon the pupil,
would require more light than any other, if this de|fect <PB N="80" REF="100">
were not compen&s;ated. But what forms a complete apology for Ari&s;totle's
arranging it among the nocturnal birds is, that the &s;ight of the Sea-eagle is
not &s;o acute as that of the Com|mon Eagle; and becau&s;e it commits its
ravages by night as well as by day.</P>
<P>If the facts related by Ari&s;totle in his Hi&s;tory of Animals, be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their accuracy, his treati&s;e <HI>De Mirabilibus</HI> is no le&s;s remark|able for its ab&s;urdities and errors. The author even makes a&s;&s;ertions in it which are totally in|con&s;i&s;tent with what he has delivered in his other works; and if we were to compare the opinions, but particularly the facts, with tho&s;e in his Hi&s;|tory of Animals, we never &s;hould a&s;cribe the treati&s;e <HI>De Mirabilibus</HI> to that enlightened phi|lo&s;opher. Pliny, who&s;e Natural Hi&s;tory is en|tirely extracted from Ari&s;totle, would not have related &s;o many things that are fal&s;e or equivocal, had he not borrowed indi&s;criminately from the different treati&s;es attributed to the Greek, and collected the opinions of &s;ub&s;equent authors which are tinctured con&s;tantly with popular pre|judices. We can give an example without de|viating from our pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Ari&s;totle di&s;|tingui&s;hes the &s;pecies of the O&s;prey in his Hi&s;tory of Animals, &s;ince he makes it the fifth &s;pecies of eagles, to which he gives accurate di&s;criminating characters. At the &s;ame time, the O&s;prey con&s;titutes not a di&s;tinct &s;pecies in the treati&s;e <HI>De Mirabilibus,</HI> or rather is only a
<PB N="81" REF="101">
variety. Pliny, enlarging on this idea, affirms not only that the O&s;preys form no &s;eparate race, and that they proceed from the intermixture of the different &s;pecies of eagles, but that the young are not O&s;preys, and only Sea-Eagles; <HI>which Sea-Eagles,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>breed &s;mall vultures, which engender great vultures, that have not the power of propagation.</HI> What a number of incredible circum&s;tances are grouped into this pa&s;&s;age? How many things that are ab&s;urd, and contrary to every analogy? Let us even extend, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the probable limits of the variations of Nature, and let us give this pa&s;&s;age the mo&s;t favourable explanation. Suppo&s;e for a moment, that the O&s;preys are really the hybriduous off|&s;pring of the union of two different &s;pecies of eagles; that they are prolific, like the cro&s;s-breed of &s;ome other birds, and produce between them a &s;econd mongrel, which approaches nearer the &s;pecies of Sea-Eagle than if the fir&s;t mixture were that of the Sea-Eagle with another eagle; &s;o far the laws of Nature are not entirely vio|lated: but to add, that the&s;e O&s;preys, after they become Sea-Eagles, breed &s;mall vultures, and the&s;e again the great, which are incapable of generation, is to join three facts that are ab&s;olutely incredible, to two that already can hardly be believed. And though Pliny has written many things ha&s;tily, I can hardly per|&s;uade my&s;elf that he is the author of the&s;e three a&s;&s;ertions; and I am rather inclined to &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="82" REF="102">
that the end of the &s;entence has been entirely altered. At any rate it is certain that the Sea-Eagles never breed &s;mall mongrel vultures, nor do the&s;e give birth to large hybriduous vultures, who&s;e prolific powers are extingui&s;hed. Every &s;pecies of vulture produces its like, and the &s;ame is the ca&s;e with each of the eagles, the O&s;prey and the Sea-Eagle; and the intermediate kinds, bred by the intermixture of the eagles, con&s;ti|tute independent tribes, and are perpetuated like the others by a generation. Particularly, we are well informed, that the male O&s;prey breeds with its female young O&s;preys; and that, if it ever begets Sea-Eagles, this is only in the union with the Sea-Eagle. The copulation of the male O&s;prey with the female Sea-Eagle is &s;imilar to that of the he-goat with the ewe: a lamb is the fruit of this commerce, becau&s;e the influence of the ewe predominates in the conception. A Sea-Eagle is al&s;o the product of the other inter|cour&s;e; for, in general, the character of the female preponderates, and the prolific mongrels approach to the &s;pecies of the mother; and even the true hybrids, or the barren mongrels, bear a greater re&s;emblance to the race of the female than to that of the male.</P>
<P>What renders the po&s;&s;ibility of the cro&s;s-breed of the Sea-Eagle and the O&s;prey credible, is the &s;imilarity of the in&s;tincts, the di&s;po&s;itions, and even the figure of the&s;e birds; for though
<PB N="83" REF="103">
they differ widely in point of &s;ize, the Sea-Eagle being near one half larger than the O&s;prey, they are yet very much alike in their propor|tions. Their wings and legs are &s;hort, com|pared with the length of their body; the lower part of their legs and feet are naked; they fly neither &s;o high nor &s;o rapidly as the eagles; they derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence more from the finny tribe than from the bea&s;ts of game; and they haunt places contiguous to lakes or fi&s;hy &s;treams; and both of them are common in France and other temperate countries. The Sea-Eagle, as it is larger, lays only two eggs, and the O&s;prey four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sea-Eagle builds on the loftie&s;t oaks a very broad ne&s;t, into which it drops two very large eggs, that are quite round, ex|ceedingly heavy, and of a dirty white colour. Some years ago one of the&s;e was found in the park of Chambord; I &s;ent the two eggs to Reaumur, but the ne&s;t could not be detached. La&s;t year a ne&s;t was di&s;covered at St. Laurent-des-eaux, in the wood of Briou, but there was only one eaglet, which the po&s;t-ma&s;ter of that place has rai&s;ed. At Bellegarde, in the fore&s;t of Orleans, a Sea-Eagle was killed, which during the night fi&s;hed the large&s;t pikes in a pond that belonged formerly to the Duc d'Antin. Another was killed lately at Seneley in Sologne, in the moment it was carrying off a large carp in broad day. The O&s;prey lodges among the reeds, along the margin of waters; it lays each hatch four white eggs of an elliptical &s;hape: it feeds on fi&s;h. <BIBL>SALERNE.</BIBL></NOTE>. The cere of the O&s;prey and the legs and feet are generally blue, but the &s;ame parts of the Sea-Eagle are of a bright deep yellow. There is al&s;o &s;ome difference in the di&s;tribution of the colours of the plumage, but this is too &s;light to prevent their intermixture; and ana|logical
<PB N="84" REF="104">
rea&s;ons induce me to &s;uppo&s;e that the union is prolific, and that the male O&s;prey, by coupling with the female Sea-Eagle, produces Sea-Eagles; but that the female O&s;prey, by pairing with the male Sea-Eagle, gives birth to O&s;preys; and that &s;uch hybrids, whether they be Sea-Eagles or O&s;preys, inherit almo&s;t entirely the nature of their mother, and retain but &s;light traces of the character of the father; which cir|cum&s;tance di&s;tingui&s;hes them from legitimate O&s;preys or Sea-Eagles. For example; O&s;preys &s;ometimes occur with yellow feet, and Sea-Eagles with blue feet, though the rever&s;e commonly takes place. This variation of colour mu&s;t ari&s;e from the mixture of the two &s;pecies. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, O&s;preys are found, &s;uch as what the members of the Academy have de&s;cribed, that are much larger than ordinary; and at the &s;ame time &s;ome Sea-Eagles are much &s;maller than common; and the diminutive &s;ize of the&s;e can be a&s;cribed neither to the &s;ex nor to the age, but mu&s;t ari&s;e from a mixture with the &s;maller &s;pecies; that is, of the O&s;prey with the Sea-Eagle.</P>
<P>As this bird is very large, and con&s;equently little prolific, laying only two eggs once a year, and often rai&s;ing but a &s;ingle young one, the &s;pecies is no where numerous. It is however widely diffu&s;ed; it is found in almo&s;t every part

<P>I HAD this bird alive, and kept it for &s;ome time. It was taken young in the month of Augu&s;t 1768, and it appeared in January 1769 to have attained its full &s;ize. Its length, from the point of the bill to the extremity of the tail, was two feet; and to the pounces one foot eight inches: the bill from the hook to the junction of the mandible &s;eventeen lines; the tail was ten inches long; its wings when expanded mea&s;ured five feet one inch, and when clo&s;ed they reached a little beyond the end of the tail. The head, the upper &s;urface of the neck, the back, and the rump, were of an a&s;h-brown; all the feathers which cover the&s;e parts were white at their origin, but the re&s;t of them brown; &s;o that the brown concealed the white, except the
<PB REF="107">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>N^o 4. THE WHITE JOHN.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="87" REF="108"> plumage was rai&s;ed. The throat, the brea&s;t,
the belly, and the &s;ides were white, variegated with long &s;pots of a brown
ru&s;ty colour; there were tran&s;ver&s;e bars of a deeper brown upon the tail;
the cere was of a pale blue, and in it were placed the no&s;trils. The iris was
of a beautiful yellow citron, or of the colour of the oriental topaz; the feet
were of a pale fle&s;h hue, which, as well as the cere, pa&s;&s;ed into yellow
as the bird grew older. The inter&s;tices of the &s;cales which covered the
&s;kin of the legs, appeared reddi&s;h; &s;o that the whole, &s;een at a
di&s;tance, appeared, even in its tender age, to be yellow. This bird weighed
three pounds &s;even ounces af|ter a meal, and three pounds four ounces when
its &s;tomach was empty.</P>
<P>The <HI>White John</HI> is more widely removed from the eagles than any of the preceding. It re&s;embles the <HI>Bald Eagle</HI> only by the want of plumage on the legs, and the whitene&s;s of the rump and tail; but its body is differently &s;hap|ed, and is much thicker, compared with its bulk; for its extreme length is only two feet, and the expan&s;ion of its wings &s;even feet; while the girth of its body is as great as that of the Ring-tail Eagle, the length of which is two feet and an half, and the alar extent more than &s;even. Hence the <HI>White John</HI> re&s;embles in its &s;hape the O&s;prey, who&s;e wings are al&s;o &s;hort in propor|tion to its body; but its feet are not, as in that
<PB N="88" REF="109">
bird, blue: its legs al&s;o appear to be more &s;len|der and tapered than any of the Eagles. Thus, though it bears &s;ome analogy to the Eagles, the O&s;prey, and the Sea-eagle, it is yet quite a di&s;|tinct &s;pecies. It has &s;ome re&s;emblance al&s;o to the Buzzard in the di&s;po&s;ition of its colours, of its plumage, and al&s;o in a circum&s;tance which has often &s;truck me, viz. that, in certain atti|tudes, and e&s;pecially in the front view, it ap|pears like an Eagle; and that, &s;een &s;ideways or in other attitudes, its figure is &s;imilar to that of the Buzzard. This remark was al&s;o made by my de&s;igner and others; and it is &s;ingular that this ambiguity of figure corre&s;ponds to its equi|vocal di&s;po&s;ition, which is really analogous both to that of the Eagle and that of the Buzzard; in&s;omuch that the White John may, in certain re&s;pects, be con&s;idered as forming the interme|diate &s;hade between the&s;e two birds.</P>
<P>It appeared to me that this bird &s;aw very di&s;tinctly in the day-time, and was not afraid of the &s;tronge&s;t light; for it &s;pontaneou&s;ly directed its eyes to the mo&s;t luminous quarter, and even to the &s;olar effulgence. It ran with con&s;iderable &s;wiftne&s;s when &s;cared, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted its motion by its wings. When confined to its chamber, it &s;ought to approach the fire; but cold did not &s;eem to be ab&s;olutely pernicious to it, for it pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal nights in open air in fro&s;ty wea|ther without appearing to &s;uffer inconvenience.
<PB N="89" REF="110">
It fed upon raw bloody fle&s;h; but, when pinch|ed with hunger, it ate meat that had been cook|ed. It tore the fle&s;h that was offered it with its bill, and &s;wallowed it in large mor&s;els. It never drank when any per&s;on was be&s;ide it, or was within its &s;ight; but when it was in a conceal|ed place, it was ob&s;erved to drink, and to u&s;e more precaution than might be expected. A ve&s;&s;el filled with water was left within its reach; it looked anxiou&s;ly on every &s;ide, to a&s;certain that it was quite alone; it then approached the ve&s;&s;el, but &s;till ca&s;t an attentive look around: at la&s;t, after many he&s;itations, it plunged its bill up to the eyes in the water, and repeated its draught. It is probable that other birds of prey conceal them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner when they want to drink; the rea&s;on probably is, that the&s;e birds can take no liquid but by immer&s;ing their head beyond the opening of the mandibles, and even as far as the eyes; in which ca&s;e, they are thrown off their guard, and have rea&s;on to entertain fears: however, this is the only cir|cum&s;tance in which the White John &s;hewed any mi&s;tru&s;t; and in other things he appeared indifferent, or rather &s;tupid. He was not at all mi&s;chievous, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be handled without di&s;covering re&s;entment. He uttered the &s;ound, <HI>co,</HI><HI> co,</HI> a &s;light expre&s;&s;ion of contentment when food was offered him; but he &s;hewed no particular attachment to any individual. He grew fat in the autumn, and got

more fle&s;h, and became plumper than mo&s;t other birds of prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following note re&s;pecting this bird was given to me by the per&s;on entru&s;ted with my volaries:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">I offered the White John &s;everal kinds of food; as bread, chee&s;e, grapes, apples, &amp;c. but he would ta&s;te none of them, though he had fa&s;ted twenty-four hours.

I gave him worms, but he con|&s;tantly rejected them; and though one was forced into his bill, and half &s;wallowed, he threw it out. He greedily &s;wallowed mice en|tire; and I ob&s;erved, that after &s;wallowing two or three, or even a &s;ingle large one, he &s;hewed unea&s;ine&s;s, and marks of pain, droop|ing and inactive, and &s;tupid with dige&s;tion. I pre&s;ented frogs and &s;mall fi&s;h; the latter he rejected, but ate the frogs by half|dozens, and &s;ometimes more; but he did not &s;wallow them whole as he did the mice; he fixed his talons, and tore them into pieces. I withheld food from him three days, and he &s;till refu&s;ed raw fi&s;h.

<P>The White John, though very common in France, is unfrequent in every other country; &s;ince none of the naturali&s;ts of Italy, England, Germany, or the North, mention it, except from the authority of Belon. For this rea&s;on I have dwelt more fully upon the facts relating to its hi&s;tory. I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that Salerne commits a great mi&s;take, when he &s;ays that this bird is the &s;ame with the <HI>Ringtail</HI> of the Eng|li&s;h,

<P>Birds of prey are divided into two orders: the fir&s;t of which includes the warlike, the noble, and the intrepid; &s;uch as Eagles, Fal|cons, Ger-falcons, Gos-hawks, Lanners, Spar|row-hawks, &amp;c.: the &s;econd comprehends tho&s;e that are indolent, cowardly, and voracious; &s;uch as, the Vultures, the Kites, the Buzzards, &amp;c.

<P>THE Eagles have been placed at the head of the birds of prey, not becau&s;e they are larger or &s;tronger than the Vultures, but becau&s;e they are more generous, that is, not &s;o meanly cruel; their di&s;po&s;itions are bolder, their con|duct more intrepid, and their courage nobler. They are &s;timulated to their attacks, as much from the glory of conque&s;t as the appetite for plunder: the Vultures, on the contrary, are in|cited by a low gormandizing in&s;tinct; and they &s;eldom attack living animals when they can &s;atiate their voracity on the carca&s;es of the dead ones. The Eagle makes a clo&s;e fight with his enemies or his victims; he pur&s;ues his prey alone and unaided, and &s;ingly ravi&s;hes the plun|der, contends with, and &s;ecures his prey. The Vultures, on the contrary, when they expect

flocks, like ba&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and are rather robbers than war|riors,
birds of carnage than birds of prey. This tribe alone collect in numbers to
pour upon the forlorn individual, and tearing the mangled carca&s;e to the
bones, they di&s;play the bitterne&s;s of unprovoked rage. Corruption and
infection, in&s;tead of driving them to a di&s;tance, are to them powerful
attractions. Sparrow-hawks, falcons, and even the &s;malle&s;t birds &s;hew
more courage; for they &s;eek their prey alone, and almo&s;t all of them reject
putrid fle&s;h, and &s;purn a dead car|ca&s;e. If we compare birds with the
quadrupeds, the Vulture &s;eems to unite the &s;trength and cruelty of the
tiger with the cowardice and voracity of the jackals, which gather in troops to
devour carrion, and dig up carca&s;es; while the Eagle po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as we
have &s;aid, the courage, the genero&s;ity, the magnanimity, and the
muni|&s;icence of the lion.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore &s;eparate the Vultures from the Eagles by this difference of in&s;tinct; and their external appearance &s;ufficiently marks the di&s;tinction. Their eyes are rai&s;ed, while tho&s;e of the Eagle are &s;unk in the orbit; the head is bare, the neck almo&s;t naked, or covered with a &s;light down, or &s;prinkled with a few &s;traggling hairs; while the Eagle is completely clothed with feathers: the nails of the Eagle are almo&s;t &s;emi|circular, &s;ince they &s;eldom re&s;t upon the ground; while tho&s;e of the Vulture are &s;horter and le&s;s
<PB N="106" REF="128">
curved: their po&s;ture is more inclined than that of the Eagle, which is boldly erect, and almo&s;t perpendicular upon its feet; while the Vulture, who&s;e &s;ituation is half horizontal, &s;eems to be|tray the ba&s;ene&s;s of its character by the inclined po&s;ition of its body. The Vultures can even be di&s;tingui&s;hed at a di&s;tance; becau&s;e they are the only birds of prey that fly in flocks, that is, more than two or three together: be&s;ides their flight is &s;low and laborious; it is painful for them to ri&s;e from the ground; and they are obliged to make three or four attempts before they can &s;ucceed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray, and Salerne, (who generally copies him word for word,) add another di&s;criminating difference between the Vultures and the Eagles, viz. the &s;hape of the bill, which is not curved immedi|ately at its origin, but continues &s;traight for two inches before it bends. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this character is not preci&s;e; for in the Eagles al&s;o, the bill does not immediately begin its arch; the real difference is, that the &s;traight part is longer in the Vultures than in the Eagles.

<P>THIS bird is &s;till larger than the Alpine Vul|ture; its wings extend eight feet; its body is thicker and longer than that of the Golden|eagle, the legs being more than a foot in length, and the neck &s;even inches. It has, like the Alpine Vulture, a ring of white feathers at the origin of the neck; the head is covered with &s;imilar feathers, which are collected into a tuft, under which can be perceived the perforations of the ears; the neck is entirely de&s;titute of plumage; the eyes are level with the head, with large eye-lids, which are moveable, and furni&s;hed with la&s;hes; the iris is of a beautiful orange colour; the bill long and hooked, black at its origin and termination, and blui&s;h in the middle. The bird is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by a re-entrant craw, or a large cavity above the &s;tomach, which cavity is covered with hairs, pointing to its centre, and occupying the place of the craw; it is neither prominent nor pendulous, as the Alpine Vulture. The &s;kin, which appears naked on the neck, round the eyes, ears, &amp;c. is of a brown grey,
<PB N="111" REF="133">
and blui&s;h; the large&s;t feathers of the wing are two feet long, and the quill is an inch in cir|cumference; the nails are blacki&s;h, but not &s;o large or &s;o crooked as tho&s;e of the eagles.</P>
<P>I believe, as the Members of the Academy of Sciences have &s;aid, that the Fulvous Vulture is really the Great Vulture of Ari&s;totle; but, as they give no rea&s;ons in &s;upport of their opi|nion, and as Ari&s;totle &s;eems to form only two &s;pecies, or rather genera of Vultures, the Little one being whiter than the Great, which differs al&s;o in its form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are two &s;orts of Vultures, the one &s;maller and whiter, the other larger and more variegated. <BIBL>ARIST. <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; it would appear that this genus of the Great Vulture includes more than one &s;pecies. For there is only the Alpine Vul|ture which he particularly mentions, and as he does not de&s;cribe any of the other Great Vultures, we may rea&s;onably doubt if the Fulvous Vulture was the &s;ame with his Great Vulture. The Com|mon Vulture, which is as large, and perhaps more common than the Fulvous Vulture, might be equally taken for this Great Vulture; &s;o that we may infer that the Members of the Academy of Sciences were ra&s;h in affirming as certain, a thing &s;o equivocal and &s;o doubtful, without even mentioning the rea&s;on or ground of their a&s;&s;er|tion; which may be perhaps true, but which mu&s;t be proved by reflections and compari&s;ons which they have not made. I &s;hall endeavour
<PB N="112" REF="134">
to perform this ta&s;k; and &s;hall here &s;tate the rea&s;ons which have convinced me that the Fulvous Vulture is really the Great Vulture of the ancients.</P>
<P>I am then of opinion, that the &s;pecies of Fulvous Vulture con&s;i&s;ts of two varieties; the fir&s;t called by naturali&s;ts the <HI>Tawny Vulture</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Le Vautour Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ve.</HI> Bri&s;&s;.</NOTE>, and the &s;econd the <HI>Golden Vulture</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vultur Aureus,</HI> Alberti Magni, Ge&s;nerii, Raii, Willoughbei, Klein. <HI>Vultur Boeticus, &s;ive Ca&s;taneus,</HI> Alb. <HI>Le Vautour Dor&eacute;,</HI> Bri&s;&s;.</NOTE>. The dif|ference between the&s;e two birds, of which the fir&s;t is the Fulvous Vulture, is not &s;o con&s;iderable as to con&s;titute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies, for both are of the &s;ame &s;ize, and nearly of the &s;ame colour; in both, the tail is comparatively &s;hort, and the wings very long<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on &s;tates the tail of his Golden Vulture as of two feet three inches long, and the large&s;t wing-feather three feet; which would make me &s;u&s;pect that it is a different bird from the Golden Vulture of the ancients, who&s;e tail was &s;horter compared with its wings.</NOTE>, and by this common cha|racter they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other Vultures. This clo&s;e re&s;emblance<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ray and Willoughby.</NOTE> has &s;truck &s;ome naturali&s;ts even before me, and has induced them to reckon the&s;e kindred &s;pecies. I am even inclined to believe that the bird mentioned by Belon, under the name of <HI>Black Vulture,</HI> is &s;till of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the Golden and Fulvous Vulture; for it is of the &s;ame bulk, and its
<PB N="113" REF="135">
back and wings have the &s;ame colour as in the Golden Vulture. But if we unite the&s;e three varieties into one &s;pecies, the Fulvous Vulture would be the lea&s;t unfrequent of all the Great Vultures, and con&s;equently that which Ari&s;totle would principally mention. And what adds probability to the pre&s;umption is, that, accord|ing to Belon, this Great Vulture is found in Egypt, Arabia, and the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and therefore common in Greece. At any rate I am confident that we may reduce the Great Vultures which appear in Europe into four &s;pe|cies:&mdash;the Alpine, the Fulvous, the Vulture properly &s;o called, of which we &s;hall treat in the following article, and the Cre&s;ted Vulture; which differ &s;ufficiently from each other to con|&s;titute &s;eparate and di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The Academicians, who di&s;&s;ected two female Fulvous Vultures, have well ob&s;erved, that the bill is longer, and le&s;s incurvated than in the Eagles; and that it is black only at the origin and the tip, the middle being of a blui&s;h grey; that the &s;uperior mandible is marked within with a groove on each &s;ide; that the&s;e receive the cutting edges of the inferior mandible when the bill is clo&s;ed; that towards the point of the beak there is a &s;mall round protuberance, on the &s;ides of which are two little perforations through which the &s;aliva is di&s;charged; that at the ba&s;e of the beak are placed the two no&s;trils, each
<PB N="114" REF="136">
&s;ix lines long and two broad, mea&s;uring down|wards, which gives an ample &s;pace for the external organs of &s;mell; that the tongue is hard and cartilaginous, &s;cooped near the tip, and the edges rai&s;ed; that the&s;e rai&s;ed edges are &s;till harder than the re&s;t of the tongue, and form a kind of &s;aw, the teeth of which are pointed towards the gullet; that the oe&s;ophagus dilates below, and forms a large &s;ac; that this &s;ac differs from the crop of fowls only becau&s;e it is inter&s;per&s;ed with the ramifications of a great number of ve&s;&s;els which are very di&s;tinct, the membrane being exceedingly white and tran&s;|parent; that the gizzard is neither &s;o hard nor &s;o thick as in the gallinaceous tribe, and that the fle&s;hy part is not &s;o red as in the gizzards of other birds, but white, like the ventricles; that the inte&s;tines and the <HI>caecum</HI> are &s;mall as in other rapacious birds; and that the <HI>ovarium</HI> is of the ordinary &s;hape and &s;ize, and the <HI>oviductus</HI> &s;ome|what &s;erpentine, as in the poultry, and does not form a &s;traight regular canal as in mo&s;t other birds.</P>
<P>If we compare the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the in|terior &s;tructure of Vultures with tho&s;e which the &s;ame anatomi&s;ts of the Academy made on Eagles, we &s;hall ea&s;ily perceive, that though the Vultures feed upon fle&s;h, as do the Eagles, they have not the &s;ame conformation in the organs of di|ge&s;tion; and that, in this re&s;pect, they approach
<PB N="115" REF="137">
much nearer to the poultry and other birds that live upon grain; &s;ince they have a craw and a &s;tomach which, from the thickne&s;s of its lower part, may be regarded as almo&s;t a gizzard; &s;o that the Vultures &s;eem de&s;tined by their &s;tructure, not only to be carnivorous, but gra|nivorous, and even omnivorous.</P>

<P>THIS Vulture, though &s;maller than the three fir&s;t, &s;till de&s;erves to be ranked among the Great Vultures. We cannot de&s;cribe it better than in the words of Ge&s;ner, who is the only naturali&s;t that has &s;een many of the&s;e birds. The Vulture, &s;ays he, which the Germans call <HI>Ha&s;engeier, (Hare Vulture,)</HI> has a black bill, hooked at the point, ugly eyes, a large and &s;trong body, broad wings, a long and &s;traight tail; a blacki&s;h ru&s;ty plumage, and yellow feet. When at re&s;t, whether on the ground or perched, it erects the feathers of the head, which then re&s;emble two horns, but which are not perceived when it flies. The expan&s;ion of its wings is near &s;ix feet; it walks well, advancing fifteen inches at each &s;tep; it pur&s;ues birds of every kind, and preys upon them; it al&s;o catches hares, rabbits, young foxes, and &s;mall fawns, nor does it &s;pare-even the fi&s;h. Its ferocity is &s;uch, that it cannot be tamed. Sometimes it &s;eizes its prey in its flight; at other times, it darts upon
<PB N="118" REF="140">
its victims from the top of a tree or elevated cliff; but always upon the wing. It makes much noi&s;e in its flight. It breeds in the thick and de&s;ert fore&s;ts on the talle&s;t trees. It eats fle&s;h, the entrails of living animals, and even carrion; and though extremely voracious, it can bear the want of food for fourteen days. Two of the&s;e birds were caught in Al&s;ace in the month of January 1513; and in the following year, more were found in a ne&s;t built on a thick lofty oak, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city of Mi&s;en.</P>

their ne&s;ts in places &s;o lofty and inacce&s;&s;ible, that they are &s;eldom
di&s;covered; they mu&s;t be &s;ought for only on the giddy heights of de&s;ert

that covers the &s;ummit of the rock, and that a man is let down by a long rope
fixed to it, and after putting into a ba&s;ket the eggs or young which he
finds, heis drawn up by his companions. [It is well known that this is

The Vultures prefer the gloomy haunts during the <PB N="119" REF="141"> whole

It appears to me that the Black Vulture, which Belon &s;ays is common in Egypt, is one of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the Cinereous Vulture, and that we ought not to &s;eparate them, as &s;ome naturali&s;ts have done; &s;ince Belon, who alone has mentioned them, does not di&s;tingui&s;h them, and &s;peaks of the Cinereous and the Black as compo&s;ing the &s;pecies of the Great Vulture.

Little White Vulture of the Ancients, which was common in Arabia, Egypt,
Greece, Germany, and even as far as Norway, whence it was &s;ent to us. We may
remark, that the head, and the under part of the neck, are naked, and of a

Of the other &s;pecies of the A&s;h-coloured Vul|ture, I am inclined to reject, or rather to &s;epa|rate, the &s;econd, which, from Belon's de&s;crip|tion, is not a Vulture, but a bird of another genus, which he calls the <HI>Egyptian Sacre.</HI> There remains therefore only the Brown Vul|ture; with regard to which I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that I cannot perceive the rea&s;ons which led Bri&s;&s;on to refer it to the <HI>Aquila Heteropos</HI> of Ge&s;ner. On the contrary, it appears to me, that in&s;tead of reckoning the Heteropede Eagle a Vulture, we ought to era&s;e it from the cata|logue of birds; for its exi&s;tence was never proved; no naturali&s;t has &s;een it; and Ge&s;ner, who is the only one that mentions it, and whom all the others have copied, had only a drawing of it, which he cau&s;ed to be engraved, and from the figure, referred it to the genus of Eagles, and not to that of Vultures; and the epithet of <HI>Heteropede</HI> alludes to the circum&s;tance that one of the legs was blue, and the other whiti&s;h brown. But a bird, figured by an un|known per&s;on, and named afterwards from an inaccurate drawing, and which the difference of colour of the legs is alone &s;ufficient to render &s;u&s;picious; a bird which has never been &s;een by tho&s;e who mention it; can we con&s;ider &s;uch as an Eagle or a Vulture? or has it any real ex|i&s;tence?

</FIGURE> <PB N="127" REF="150"> made relating to the &s;tructure and nature of
this bird. It is undoubtedly a Vulture; for its head and neck are naked, which
is the mo&s;t di&s;criminating character of the genus. But it is not large, the
extreme length of its body not exceeding two feet two or three inches; it is
not thicker than the female turkey; its wings are &s;horter in proportion to
the other Vultures; its bill is thick and &s;hort, and begins its curva|ture
only at the point; in &s;ome the bill is en|tirely red; in others only red at
the extremity, and black in the middle; the cere is of an orange-colour, broad,
and &s;tretching from each &s;ide to the crown of the head; in the cere are
placed the no&s;trils, of an oblong &s;hape, and be|tween which the &s;kin
projects like a loo&s;e jagg|ed comb, falling indifferently on either &s;ide,
ac|cording as the bird moves its head; the eyes are &s;urrounded by a red
&s;kin, and the iris has the colour and lu&s;tre of pearls; the head and neck
are naked, the crown covered with a fle&s;h-coloured &s;kin, which is of a
lively red behind, and darker before; below the hind part of the head ri&s;es a
&s;mall tuft of down, from which there extends, on each &s;ide under the
throat, a wrinkled &s;kin of a browni&s;h colour, and mixed with blue and red
near its termination; this &s;kin is marked with &s;mall lines of black down.
The cheeks, or &s;ides of the head, are covered with a black down; and between
the bill and the eyes, behind the in&s;ertion of the mandibles, 
<PB N="128" REF="151"> there is a brown purple &s;pot; on the upper part of the
arch of the neck there is on each &s;ide a &s;mall longitudinal line of black
down, and the &s;pace included between the&s;e two lines is of a dirty yellow;
the &s;ides of the arch of the neck are of a red colour, which, as it
de&s;cends, pa&s;&s;es by in&s;en&s;ible &s;hades into yellow; under the naked
part of the neck is a collar or ruff compo&s;ed of pretty long &s;oft feathers
of a deep a&s;h-colour; this collar, which entirely encircles the neck, and
de&s;cends upon the brea&s;t, is &s;o broad that, when the bird contracts
it&s;elf, it can conceal the neck and part of the head like a cowl; and this is
the rea&s;on why &s;ome natu|rali&s;ts have given it the name of <HI>Monk.</HI>
The feathers on the brea&s;t, the belly, the things, the legs, and the under
&s;urface of the tail, are white, &s;lightly tinged with yellow; tho&s;e of the
rump, and the upper &s;urface of the tail, vary, being black in &s;ome
individuals, and in others white: the other feathers of the tail are always
black, and &s;o are the great feathers of the wings, which are commonly edged
with grey. The colour of the feet and nails is not the &s;ame in all the&s;e
birds; in &s;ome the feet are of a dull white, or yellowi&s;h, and the nails
blacki&s;h; in others, the feet and nails are reddi&s;h; the nails are very
&s;hort, and but &s;lightly curved.</P>
<P>This bird is a native of South America, and not of the Ea&s;t Indies, as &s;ome authors have

it <HI>Regina Aurarum</HI>; but <HI>Aura</HI> is not derived from the Latin, it

delicately &s;en&s;ible of cold, and therefore could not pa&s;s by the way of
the North. I am at lea&s;t certain, that this bird is confined to its natal
region, and haunts the tracts between Brazil and New Spain.</P>
<P>The King Vulture is neither elegant, noble, nor generous; it attacks only weak victims, and feeds upon rats, lizards, &s;erpents, and even the excrements of animals and men. Hence it has a di&s;gu&s;ting &s;mell, and not even the &s;avages can eat its fle&s;h.</P>

<PB N="132" REF="155"> it is accordingly more cowardly, more filthy, and more
voracious than any of them, feeding rather upon carrion and filth than upon

pur&s;ue its prey, and only grovels among the dead carca&s;&s;es. If it
&s;ometimes &s;ummons re&s;olution to make an a&s;|&s;ault, it collects in
numerous flocks, and &s;ur|pri&s;es the helple&s;s &s;olitary animal while
drown|ed in &s;leep or di&s;armed by wounds.</P>
<P>The Carrion Vulture is the &s;ame bird with that which Kolben de&s;cribes under the name of the <HI>Eagle of the Cape.</HI> It is therefore found both on the continent of Africa and that of South America; and as it is not ob&s;erved in the coun|tries of the North, it mu&s;t have traver&s;ed the &s;ea between Brazil and Guinea. Hans Sloane, who &s;aw many of them in America, &s;ays, that they fly like kites, and are always lean. Hence it is very po&s;&s;ible, from their agility and the rapidity of their cour&s;e, that they could perform the di&s;tant journey acro&s;s the ocean which &s;eparates the two continents. Hernandes informs us, that they feed upon animal carca&s;&s;es, and even human excre|ments; that they a&s;&s;emble on the lofty trees, whence they de&s;cend in flocks to devour carrion; and he adds, their fle&s;h has an offen&s;ive &s;mell, ranker than that of the raven.

the inhabited &s;pots; that their &s;ight is very acute, and that they de&s;cry, from a towering height and an immen&s;e di&s;tance, the carca&s;&s;es on which they prey; that they maintain a gloomy &s;ilence, and never &s;cream or &s;ing, and are heard only by a &s;light murmur, which they &s;eldom utter; that they are very common on the plantations in South America, and that their young are white in their infancy, and become brown or blacki&s;h as they grow old. Marcgrave, in the de&s;crip|tion which he gives of this bird, &s;ays, that its feet are whiti&s;h, its eyes bright, and of a ruby colour; the tongue grooved, and &s;errated on the &s;ides. Ximenes a&s;&s;ures us, that the&s;e birds never fly but in large flocks, and are always very lofty in their cour&s;e; that they all alight together upon the &s;ame prey, and, without contention, devour it to the bones, and gorge them&s;elves to &s;uch a degree, that they are unable to re&s;ume their flight.

The Spaniards, who are &s;ettled upon the large i&s;lands, and upon the continent, as well as the Portugue&s;e, who inhabit tho&s;e tracts where they traffic in hides, receive great benefit from the&s;e birds, by their devouring the dead bodies and preventing infection; and therefore they impo&s;e a fine upon tho&s;e who de&s;troy them. This protection has extremely multiplied this di&s;gu&s;ting kind of turkey. It is found in many parts of Guiana as well as in Brazil, New Spain, and the large i&s;lands. It has the &s;mell of carrion, which nothing can

remove; the rump has been torn from it at the in&s;tant of its being killed, and the entrails extracted, but all to no effect; for the fle&s;h, which is hard, tough, and &s;tringy, &s;till re|tained an in&s;upportable odour.</Q>  <Q REND="inline">The&s;e birds,</Q> &s;ays Kolben, <Q REND="inline">feed upon dead animals: I my|&s;elf have often &s;een the &s;keletons of cows, oxen, and wild bea&s;ts, which they had de|voured.

One could hardly perceive that the carca&s;e is hollow till he is near it.&mdash;They perform it in this way: They fir&s;t make an opening in the belly of the animal and tear out the entrails, which they eat; they then enter the hollow and &s;e|parate the fle&s;h. The Dutch of the Cape call the&s;e Eagles <HI>Stront-vogels,</HI> or <HI>Stront-jagers</HI>; that is, <HI>dung birds.</HI> It often happens that an ox, after being unyoked from the plough, and allowed to return alone to its &s;tall; lies down by the way to re&s;t it&s;elf; and if the&s;e Eagles ob&s;erve its unguarded po&s;ture, they infallibly fall upon it and devour it.&mdash;When they want to attack a cow or an ox, they collect to the number of a hundred or more, and pour at once upon the unfortunate victim. They have &s;o quick a &s;ight, that they can di&s;cern

their prey at an amazing height, and when it would e&s;cape the mo&s;t acute eye; and, when they perceive the favourable moment, they de&s;cend directly upon the animal, which they watch. The&s;e Eagles are rather larger than wild gee&s;e, their feathers are partly black, partly light grey, but the black pre|dominates; their beak is thick, hooked, and pointed; their claws large and &s;harp.</Q>&mdash; <Q REND="inline">This bird,</Q> &s;ays Cate&s;by, <Q REND="inline">weighs four pounds and a half; the head and part of the neck is red, bald and fle&s;hy as in the turkey, be&s;et with &s;traggling bri&s;tles; the bill is two inches and an half long, partly covered with fle&s;h, and its tip, which is white, is hooked like that of the falcon, but it has no whi&s;kers at the &s;ides of the upper mandible; the no&s;trils are large and open, placed before at a remark|able di&s;tance from the eyes; the plumage through the whole of the body has a mixture of deep purple and green; its legs &s;hort and fle&s;h-coloured, its toes long as in the dome&s;tic cocks, and its nails, which are black, are not &s;o much hooked as tho&s;e of falcons.

habits which have a reference to the &s;tate of civil &s;ociety. We mu&s;t &s;tudy the di&s;po&s;itions of the Vultures in the &s;olitary tracts in America, to di&s;|cover what would be the manners of our own, if they were not mole&s;ted in their retreats, checked in their multiplication, and di&s;turbed in their operations by our crowded population.&mdash;The&s;e are their primitive characters.&mdash;In every part of the globe, they are voracious, &s;lothful, offen&s;ive, and hateful; and, like the wolves, are as noxious during their life, as u&s;ele&s;s after their death. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">We may add from Mr. Pennant, that the Carrion Vultures are not found in the northern regions of the Ancient Continent; but in the New they are common through its whole extent, from Nova Scotia to Terra del Fuego, and al&s;o in the We&s;t India i&s;lands, though they are &s;aid to be &s;maller there than on the main-land. They &s;warm in the torrid zone; and about Carthagena e&s;pecially, they haunt inhabited places, fit in numbers on the roofs of hou&s;es, or walk with &s;luggi&s;h pace along the &s;treets. They watch the female alligator as &s;he hides her eggs in the &s;and, and on her re|treat, they hurry to the &s;pot, and eagerly lay bare the depo&s;itory, and devour the whole contents.</NOTE></P>

Ge&s;ner relates, from the te&s;ti|mony of an author of credit (George
Fabricius) the following facts. Some pea&s;ants between Mie&s;en and Bri&s;a,
cities in Germany, lo&s;ing every day &s;ome of their cattle, which they in
vain &s;ought for in the fore&s;ts, ob&s;erved a very large ne&s;t re&s;ting on
three oaks, con&s;tructed with &s;ticks and branches of trees, and as wide as
would cover a cart. They found in this ne&s;t three young birds already &s;o
large, that their wings extended &s;even ells; their legs were as thick as
tho&s;e of a lion, the nails of the &s;ize of a man's fingers; and in the
ne&s;t, were &s;eve|ral &s;kins of calves and &s;heep. Valmont de Bo|mare and
Salerne have thought, as well as my|&s;elf, that the <HI>Laemmer Geyer</HI> of
the Alps mu&s;t be the Condur of Peru. Its &s;pread wings, &s;ays Bomare,
extend fourteen feet; it commits dread|ful <PB N="149" REF="172"> havoc among
the goats, the &s;heep, the cha|mois, the hares and the marmots. Salerne al&s;o
relates a deci&s;ive fact on this &s;ubject, which de|&s;erves to be quoted at
length. 
<Q REND="inline">In 1719, M. D&eacute;|radin, father-in-law to M. de Lac,
&s;hot at his ca&s;tle of Mylourdin, in the pari&s;h of Saint-Martind' Abat, a
bird which weighed eighteen pounds, and who&s;e wings mea&s;ured eighteen feet.
It flew for &s;ome days about a pond, and was pierced by two balls under the
wing. The upper part of its body was mottled with black, grey, and white; the
top of its belly red as &s;carlet; and its feathers were cri&s;ped. They ate of
it both at the ca&s;tle of Mylour|din and at Ch&acirc;teauneuf-&s;ur-Loire; the
fle&s;h was found tough and fibrous, and &s;melt of the mar&s;h. I &s;aw and
examined one of the &s;mall feathers of the wings, which was larger than the
quill-feather of the &s;wan. This &s;ingular bird &s;eemed to be the
Condur.</Q> In &s;hort, the enormous &s;ize mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a
deci&s;ive character; and though the <HI>Laem|mer Geyer</HI> of the Alps
differs from the Condur of Peru by the tints of its plumage, we cannot but
refer them to the &s;ame &s;pecies, at lea&s;t till we obtain a more accurate
de&s;cription of both.</P>
<P>It appears from the te&s;timonies of travellers, that the Condur of Peru has a plumage marked with black and white, like that of the magpie; and therefore the large bird killed in France at the ca&s;tle of Mylourdin re&s;embles it both in &s;ize
<PB N="150" REF="173">
and colour. We may therefore conclude, with great probability, that the&s;e exalted &s;ort of birds, though very rare, are &s;cattered over both con|tinents; and feeding upon every kind of prey, and dreading nothing but the human race, avoid the habitations of men, and confine their haunts to exten&s;ive de&s;erts, or lofty mountains.</P>

<P>THESE ignoble, filthy, and &s;lothful birds ought to follow the vultures, which they re&s;em|ble by their di&s;po&s;itions and habits. The vul|tures, though de&s;titute of every generous qua|lity, claim, by their &s;ize and &s;trength, a princi|pal rank among the feathered race. The Kites and Buzzards, inferior to the&s;e in force and magnitude, far exceed them in numbers. They are more trouble&s;ome; they oftener vi&s;it inha|bited &s;pots, and &s;ettle nearer the re&s;idence of men; they build their ne&s;ts in places more ac|ce&s;&s;ible; they &s;eldom remain in de&s;erts, but pre|fer the fertile hills and dales to the barren moun|tains. In &s;uch &s;ituations, Nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the forming indu&s;try of man, teems with vegetable and animal productions, and pre&s;ents an ea&s;y and abundant harve&s;t to the voracious tribe. The Kites and Buzzards are neither bold nor timid; they have a kind of &s;tupid ferocity, which gives them an air of cool intrepidity, and &s;eems to remove the &s;en&s;e of danger. It is ea&s;ier to approach and to kill them than the eagles or vultures; when detained in captivity, they are le&s;s capable of in&s;truction; and they have always
<PB N="152" REF="176">
been pro&s;cribed and era&s;ed from the catalogue of noble birds, and bani&s;hed from the &s;chool of falconry. In all ages, it has been common to compare a gro&s;s &s;hamele&s;s man to a Kite, and a di&s;gu&s;ting &s;tupid woman to a Buzzard.</P>

<P>This &s;ort of Kite is common in France, e&s;pe|cially in the provinces of Franche-compt&eacute;, Dau|phin&eacute;, Bugey, Auvergne, and in all the others which are in the vicinity of mountains.

<P>THE Buzzard is &s;o common and &s;o well known, that it requires no particular de|&s;cription. Its length is twenty or twenty|one inches; its alar extent four feet and an half; its tail is only eight inches, and the wings, when clo&s;ed, reach a little beyond its point; the iris is of a pale yellow, and al|mo&s;t whiti&s;h; the cere and feet are yellow, and the nails black.</P>
<P>This bird re&s;ides the whole year in our fore&s;ts; it appears &s;tupid, whether in the dome&s;tic &s;tate, or in that of liberty; it is &s;edentary, and even indolent; it often continues for &s;everal hours together perched upon the &s;ame tree; its ne&s;t is con&s;tructed with &s;mall branches lined in the in|&s;ide with wool, and other &s;oft, light materials; it lays two or three eggs, which are whiti&s;h,
<PB N="160" REF="185">
&s;potted with yellow. It feeds and tends its young longer than the other birds of prey, mo&s;t of which expel their brood before they are able to provide with ea&s;e for them&s;elves. Ray even af|firms that if the mother happen to be killed in the time of her tender charge, the male Buzzard patiently di&s;charges the tru&s;t.</P>
<P>This bird of rapine does not &s;eize its prey on the wing; it &s;its on a tree, a bu&s;h, or a hillock, and darts upon the humble game that comes within its reach. It catches young hares and young rabbits, as well as partridges and quails; it commits havoc upon the ne&s;ts of mo&s;t birds; and when more generous &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is &s;canty, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon frogs, lizards, &s;erpents, and gra&s;s-hoppers.</P>

<P>AS the Honey Buzzard differs but little from the Common Buzzard, they have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by tho&s;e only who have carefully com|pared them. They have indeed more analogous than di&s;criminating characters, but the difference of external appearance and of natural habits, is &s;ufficient to con&s;titute two &s;pecies; which, though allied, are yet &s;eparate and independent. The Honey Buzzard is as large as the Buzzard, and weighs near two pounds; its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail is twenty-two inches; its wings extend four feet two inches, and when clo&s;ed reach to three-fourths of the tail; its bill is rather longer than that of the Buzzard; the cere is yellow, thick, and un|equal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some naturali&s;ts have &s;aid that the bill is black; but we may pre&s;ume that this difference is owing to age, &s;ince it is fir&s;t white; perhaps it becomes &s;ucce&s;&s;ively yellow, brown, and black.</NOTE>; its no&s;trils are long and curved; when the bill opens, the mouth appears very large and of a yellow colour; the iris is of a bright yel|low; the legs and feet are of the &s;ame colour,
<PB N="162" REF="187">
and the nails, which are not much hooked, are &s;trong and blacki&s;h; the head is large and flat, and of a grey cinereous. A full de&s;cription of this bird occurs in the work of Bri&s;&s;on and in that of Albin; the la&s;t author, after de&s;cribing the ex|ternal parts of the Honey Buzzard, &s;ays, that its inte&s;tines are &s;horter than in the Common Buzzard; and he adds, that there are found in the &s;tomach of the Honey Buzzard &s;everal green caterpillars, as al&s;o &s;ome common caterpillars and other in&s;ects.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, as well as the Common Buzzards, build their ne&s;ts with &s;mall &s;ticks, and line them with wool; their eggs are of an a&s;h-colour, and marked with &s;mall brown &s;pots. Sometimes they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ne&s;ts of other birds; for they have been found in an old ne&s;t of the Kite. They feed their young with cry&s;alids, and particularly with tho&s;e of wa&s;ps. The heads and different portions of wa&s;ps have been di&s;|covered in a ne&s;t in which were two young Honey Buzzards. At that tender age, they are covered with a white down, &s;potted with black; the feet are of a pale yellow, and the cere white. In the &s;tomach of the&s;e birds, which is very large, there are al&s;o found entire frogs and lizards. The female is larger than the male, and both trip and run, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their wings, as fa&s;t as our dunghill cocks.</P>
<P>Though Belon &s;ays that there is not a young &s;hepherd in Limagne in Auvergne, who is not
<PB N="163" REF="188">
acquainted with the Honey Buzzard, and could not catch it with a &s;nare baited with frogs, or bird|lime, or even with a noo&s;e, it is certain that at pre&s;ent they are more rare in France than the Common Buzzard. Among twenty Buzzards brought to me at different times in Burgundy, there was not a &s;ingle Honey Buzzard; nor do I know from what province the &s;pecimen came which we have in the king's cabinet. Salerne &s;ays, that in the country of Orleans, the Com|mon Buzzard is named Honey Buzzard; but the&s;e may be different birds.</P>
<P>The Honey Buzzard generally &s;its upon low trees to &s;py its prey. It catches field mice, frogs, lizards, caterpillars, and other in&s;ects. It &s;carcely flies but from tree to tree, or from bu&s;h to bu&s;h, always low; nor does it &s;oar like the Kite, which it re&s;embles by its in&s;tincts, but from which it can be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed by its motions and the &s;hape of its tail. It is com|mon to place &s;nares for the Honey Buzzard, becau&s;e in winter it is very fat and delicate to eat.</P>

<P>THE modern naturali&s;ts have given this bird the name of <HI>Lanner Falcon</HI> or <HI>Cinereous Lanner</HI>; but it appears to be of a different genus from either the Fa&lacute;con or the Lanner. It is rather larger than the common crow, and its body is proportionally more delicate and flex|ible. Its legs are long and &s;lender: whereas tho&s;e of the Falcon are robu&s;t and &s;hort; and the Lanner is de&s;cribed by Belon to be &s;till lower on its legs than any Falcon; but in this character it re&s;embles the White John and the Ring-tail. The only analogy therefore which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts be|tween it and the Lanner, is founded in the habit of tearing with its bill all the &s;mall animals which it catches, and in not &s;wallowing them entire like the other large birds of prey. It ought, &s;ays Edwards, to be cla&s;&s;ed with the Long|tailed Falcons: in my opinion, it &s;hould be
<PB N="165" REF="190">
ranged with the Buzzards, or rather placed next the Ring-tail, to which it is &s;imilar in its in|&s;tincts, and in many of its properties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon does not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that it is of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the White John, and at the &s;ame time he admits, that it is much like the Kite. <Q REND="inline">There is &s;till another &s;pecies of the White John or St. Martin, called <HI>White-tail,</HI> of the &s;ame kind with the above&s;aid; but in colour it is much more like the Royal Kite, though more &s;lender&mdash;It re&s;embles the Royal Kite &s;o much, that we could not perceive the difference, were it not &s;maller and whiter under the belly, the feathers on the rump being white both above and below, and hence it is named <HI>White-tail.</HI></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This bird is pretty common in France, as well as Germany and England; the &s;pecimen which we have figured was killed in Burgundy. Fri&s;ch has given two plates of this &s;ame bird, N^o 79 and 80, which differ &s;o little from each other, that we cannot con&s;ider them, as he does, a different &s;pecies; for the varieties which he re|marks are &s;o light, that they mu&s;t be a&s;cribed &s;olely to age or &s;ex. Edwards, who al&s;o pre|&s;ents an engraving of this bird, &s;ays, that the &s;pecimen from which it was taken was killed near London; and he adds, that it was ob&s;erved to flutter about the foot of &s;ome old trees, and &s;ometimes to &s;trike the trunks with its bill and claws, and that the rea&s;on of the motion could not be perceived till after its death, when the body being opened, there were found in its &s;tomach twenty &s;mall lizzards, torn or cut into two or three portions.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="191">
When we compare this bird with what Belon &s;ays of this &s;econd Saint Martin, we cannot doubt of their identity; and be&s;ides the re&s;em|blance in point of &s;ize, &s;hape, and colour, their natural habits of flying low, and &s;earching eager|ly and ince&s;&s;antly for &s;mall reptiles, belong not &s;o much to the Falcons and other noble birds, as to the Buzzard, the Harpy, and others which partake of the groveling manners of the Kites. This bird, which is well de&s;cribed and figured by Edwards, is different from what the authors of the Briti&s;h Zoology name the <HI>Hen Harrier.</HI> The&s;e are di&s;tinct birds, of which the fir&s;t, what we call after Belon the <HI>Saint Martin,</HI> has, as I have &s;aid, been mentioned by Fri&s;ch and Bri&s;&s;on under the name of <HI>Lanner-Falcon</HI> or <HI>Cinereous Lanner</HI>; the &s;econd, which is the <HI>Subbuteo</HI> of Ge&s;ner; and which we term <HI>Soubu&s;e,</HI> has been named <HI>White-tail-Eagle</HI> by Al|bin, and <HI>Collared-Falcon</HI> by Bri&s;&s;on. Be&s;ides, the falconers call this bird Saint Martin, the <HI>Hawk Harpy.

<P>THIS bird re&s;embles the Saint Martin in its in&s;tincts and habits; both fly low to catch field-mice and reptiles; both enter the outer|court, and haunt the places where poultry is kept, to &s;eize young pigeons and chickens; both are ignoble birds, which attack only the weak and feeble, and therefore de&s;erve neither the name of Falcons nor that of Lanners.</P>
<P>The male, as in other rapacious birds, is much &s;maller than the female, and is be&s;ides di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the want of a collar, that is of &s;mall feathers bri&s;tled round the neck.

<P>HARPY is an ancient generic name which has been be&s;towed upon the Moor or Mar&s;h Buzzards, and &s;ome other kindred tribes; &s;uch as the Ringtail and the Hen-harrier, which has been termed the <HI>Hawk Harpy.</HI> We have con&s;idered the name as &s;pecific, and have ap|plied it to the bird which falconers at pre&s;ent call <HI>Red-harpy,</HI> and which our nomenclators term <HI>Red-buzzard</HI>; and Fri&s;ch, improperly, <HI>Middle Lanner Vulture,</HI> as he has al&s;o impro|perly termed the Mar&s;h Buzzard, <HI>Great Lanner Vulture.</HI> We have preferred the &s;imple name of <HI>Harpy,</HI> becau&s;e it is certain that this bird is neither a Vulture nor a Buzzard. Its habits are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the two birds which we have treated in the two preceding articles. It catches fi&s;h like the White John, and draws them alive out of the water. It &s;eems, &s;ays

Fri&s;ch, to have a more acute &s;ight than any of the other birds of rapine, its eye-brows being more projected. It is found both in France and in Germany, and loves to haunt the &s;ides of rivers and pools. In its in&s;tincts it re&s;embles the preceding, and therefore we &s;hall not be more particular.</P>

<P>THIS bird was formerly called the <HI>Ba&s;tard Partridge,</HI> and &s;ome falconers term it the <HI>White-headed Harpy.</HI> It is more voracious and le&s;s fluggi&s;h than the Common Buzzard; and this is perhaps the only rea&s;on that it appears not &s;o &s;tupid and more vicious. It commits dreadful havoc among the rabbits, and is equally de&s;tructive to the fi&s;h as to the game. In&s;tead of haunting, like the Common Buzzard, the mountain-fore&s;ts, it lodges only in the bu&s;hes, the hedges, and ru&s;hes near pools, mar&s;hes, and rivers that abound with fi&s;h. It builds its ne&s;t at
<PB REF="199">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>N^o 10. THE MOOR BUZZARD.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="173" REF="200"> a &s;mall height above the &s;urface of the
ground in the bu&s;hes, or even in hillocks covered with thick herbage. It lays
three eggs, &s;ometimes four; and though it appears to be more prolific than
the Common Buzzard, and, like it, is a &s;tationary bird, a native of France,
where it continues the whole year, it is however more rare, or at lea&s;t more
difficult to be found.</P>
<P>Though the Moor Buzzard re&s;embles the Black Kite in many re&s;pects, we mu&s;t take care not to confound them; for the Moor Buzzard has, like the Common Buzzard, the Honey Buzzard, &amp;c. a &s;hort thick neck; whereas the Kite has a much larger one. And the Moor Buzzard is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Common Buzzard: fir&s;t, by the places it haunts; &s;econdly, by its flight, which is more rapid and &s;teady; thirdly, be|cau&s;e it never perches upon large trees, but re&s;ts upon the ground, or in the bu&s;hes; fourthly, by the length of its legs, which, like tho&s;e of the Hen-harrier and Ringtail, are proportionally taller and &s;lenderer than tho&s;e of the other birds of rapine.</P>
<P>The Moor Buzzard prefers water-fowl; as divers, ducks, &amp;c. It catches fi&s;h alive, and tran&s;ports them in its talons; and when nobler prey fails, it feeds upon reptiles, toads, frogs, and aquatic in&s;ects. Though &s;maller than the Common Buzzard, it procures a more plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; probably becau&s;e it is more active and vigorous in its movements, and has a
<PB N="174" REF="201">
keener appetite: it is al&s;o more courageous. Belon a&s;&s;erts, that he has &s;een it trained to hunt and catch rabbits, partridges, and quails. It flies more heavily than the Kites; and, when it is pur&s;ued by the Falcons, it does not ri&s;e into the air, but flies in a horizontal direction. A &s;ingle Falcon is not able to get the better of it, and it would require two or three to be let loo&s;e at once; for, like the Kite, it meets its antago|ni&s;t, but makes a more vigorous and bold de|fence. The hobbies and the ke&s;trils are afraid of it, decline the conflict, and even fly its ap|proach.</P>

<P>The bird found in the tracts contiguous to Hud&s;on's-bay, which Edwards terms the <HI>A&s;h-coloured Buzzard,</HI> and which he de&s;cribes nearly in the following words:&mdash;This bird is of the bulk of a cock, or a middle-&s;ized hen; it re|&s;embles the Common Buzzard in its &s;hape and the di&s;po&s;ition of its colours; the bill and the cere are of a blui&s;h leaden-colour; the head and the upper part of the neck are covered with white feathers, &s;potted with deep brown in their middle; the brea&s;t is white, like the head, but it is mottled with larger brown &s;pots; the belly and &s;ides are covered with brown feathers, marked with white round or oval &s;pots; the legs are clothed with &s;oft white feathers, &s;pec|kled irregularly with brown; the coverts of the under part of the tail are radiated tran&s;ver&s;ely with black and white; all the upper parts of the neck, of the back, of the wings, and of the tail, are covered with feathers of a brown cine|reous colour, deeper in the middle, and lighter near the edges; the coverts of the lower parts of the wings are of a dark brown, with white &s;pots; the feathers of the tail are barred above with narrow lines of an ob&s;cure colour, and barred below with white lines; the legs and
<PB N="178" REF="205">
feet are cinereous blui&s;h; the nails are black, and the legs covered half their length with fea|thers of a dull colour. Edwards adds, that this bird, which is found about Hud&s;on's-bay, preys chiefly upon the white grous. After compar|ing this bird as thus de&s;cribed with the Com|mon Buzzards, the Ringtails, the Harpies, and the Moor-Buzzards, it appeared to us to differ from them all, by the &s;hape of its body, and the &s;hortne&s;s of its legs. It has the port of the Eagle; its legs are &s;hort like tho&s;e of the Fal|con, and blue like tho&s;e of the Lanner. We ought therefore to refer it to the genus of the Falcon or of the Lanner, rather than to that of the Buzzard. But as Edwards is one of the able&s;t ornithologi&s;ts, we have relinqui&s;hed our opinion and adopted his; and for this rea&s;on we have placed this bird after the Buzzards.</P>

<P>THOUGH nomenclators have reckoned &s;everal &s;pecies of Sparrow-hawks, we are of opi|nion that they may all be reduced to one. Bri&s;&s;on mentions four &s;pecies, or varieties; viz. the Common Sparrow-hawk, the Spotted Spar|row-hawk, the Small Sparrow-hawk, and the Lark Sparrow-hawk. But we have di&s;covered that this Lark Sparrow-hawk is only a female Ke&s;tril. We have al&s;o found that the Small Sparrow-hawk is but the Tiercel, or male of the Common Sparrow-hawk; &s;o that there remains only the Spotted Sparrow-hawk, which is mere|ly an accidental variety of the common &s;pecies of the Sparrow-hawk. Klein is the fir&s;t who has mentioned this variety; and he &s;ays, that it was &s;ent to him from the country of Marienbourg: we ought therefore to refer the Small Sparrow-hawk
<PB N="180" REF="208">
and the Spotted Sparrow-hawk to the common &s;pecies, and exclude the Lark Spar|row-hawk, which is only the female Ke&s;tril.</P>
<P>It appears that the Sorrel Tiercel of the Spar|row-hawk, N^o 466, pl. Eul. differs from the Haggard Tiercel, N^o 467, pl. Eul. the brea&s;t and belly of the former being much whiter, and with a much &s;maller mixture of ru&s;t-colour than in the latter, in which the&s;e parts are almo&s;t en|tirely ru&s;t, and cro&s;&s;ed with brown bars; in the former the brea&s;t is marked with &s;pots, or with much more irregular bars. The male Sparrow-hawk is called <HI>Ta&s;&s;el</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mouchet.</NOTE> by the falconers; its back receives more brown as it grows older, and the tran&s;ver&s;e bars on the brea&s;t are not very regular till it has undergone the fir&s;t or &s;econd moult: the &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the female, N^o 412, pl. Eul. To give a fuller idea of the changes in the di&s;tribution of the colours, we &s;hall remark that the &s;pots on the brea&s;t and belly of the Sor|rel Tiercel are almo&s;t all detached, and form ra|ther the figure of a heart, or rounded triangle, than a continued and uniform &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a brown colour, &s;uch as we perceive in the bars on the brea&s;t and belly of the Haggard Tiercel, that is of the Tiercel which has had two moult|ings: the &s;ame changes happen in the female, in which the brown tran&s;ver&s;e belts are in the fir&s;t year only unconnected &s;pots. It will be found in the following article that the Gos-hawk
<PB N="181" REF="209">
is &s;till more remarkable for the variations of colour. Nothing more clearly demon&s;trates that the characters which our nomenclators have drawn from the di&s;tribution of colours are in|&s;ufficient, than that the &s;ame bird has the fir&s;t year &s;pots or brown longitudinal bars extend|ing downwards; and the &s;econd year is marked with tran&s;ver&s;e belts of the &s;ame colour. This &s;ingular change is more &s;triking in the Gos-hawk, and in the Sparrow-hawks; but it occurs in a certain degree al&s;o in other &s;pecies of birds. In &s;hort, all the &s;y&s;tems that are founded upon difference of colour and di&s;tribution of &s;pots, are in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e entirely futile.</P>
<P>The Sparrow-hawk continues the whole year in our provinces. The &s;pecies is numerous; I have received many in the depth of winter that had been killed in the woods; at that time they were very lean, and weighed only &s;ix ounces. They are nearly of the &s;ize of a magpie. The female is much larger than the male; &s;he builds her ne&s;t on the loftie&s;t trees of the fore&s;t, and generally lays four or five eggs, which are &s;pot|ted with a yellow reddi&s;h near the ends. The Sparrow-hawk is docile, and can be ea&s;ily train|ed to hunt partridges and quails; it al&s;o catches pigeons that &s;tray from their flock, and commits prodigious deva&s;tation on the chaffinches, and other &s;mall birds which troop together in win|ter. It is probable that the Sparrow-hawk is more numerous than we &s;uppo&s;e; for be&s;ides
<PB N="182" REF="210">
tho&s;e that remain the whole year in our climate, it appears at certain &s;ea&s;ons to migrate in im|men&s;e bodies to other countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I mu&s;t here tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age of con&s;iderable length from Belon, which proves the migration of the&s;e birds, and even points out the time when they begin their flight:</P> 
<P><Q REND="inline">We were at the mouth of the Pontus Euxinus, where begins the &s;trait of the Propontis: we a&s;cended the highe&s;t mountain, and found a bird-catcher very &s;ucce&s;sfully employed; and, as it was about the end of April, when no birds can build their ne&s;ts, we thought it &s;trange that &s;o many Kites and Sparrow-hawks &s;hould flock thither. The bird-catcher was very a&s;&s;iduous, and &s;carcely allowed one to e&s;cape; he caught more than a dozen in an hour. He was concealed behind a bu&s;h, and in front, about two or three paces di&s;tant, he had con&s;tructed a clo&s;e &s;quare airy mea&s;uring two paces; round it were fixed &s;ix &s;taffs, three on each &s;ide, an inch thick, and about a man's height, and on the top of each a notch was cut; a very fine green net was fa&s;tened to the&s;e notches, and &s;pread a man's height from the ground; in the middle of the &s;pace was a &s;take of a cubit high, and to the top of which was attached a cord that led to the per&s;on concealed behind the bu&s;h; to this cord &s;everal birds were fa&s;tened, and fed on grain within the airy. When the bird-catcher perceived the Sparrow-hawk advancing from the &s;ea, he &s;cared the&s;e birds; and the Sparrow-hawk, who&s;e fight is &s;o keen as to de&s;cry them at the di&s;tance of half a league, &s;hot with expanded wings to &s;eize his prey, and in the eagerne&s;s and rapidity of his motion was entangled in the net. The per&s;on then took the bird, and &s;lipped it into a linen bandage ready &s;ewed, which con|fined the wings, thighs, and the tail, and threw it upon the ground, where it could not &s;tir. We could not conceive whence the Spar|row-hawks came, for during the two hours that we &s;taid, more than thirty were caught; &s;o that in a day one man might catch above a hundred.

<P>THE Gos-hawk is a beautiful bird, much larger than the Sparrow-hawk, which it however re&s;embles by its in&s;tincts, and by a common character, that, in the birds of rapine, is confined to them and the Butcher-birds: this is, that their wings are &s;o &s;hort as not to reach near the end of the tail. It re&s;embles the Spar|row-hawk al&s;o by another circum&s;tance;&mdash;the fir&s;t feather of the &s;hort wing is rounded at the tip, and the fourth feather of the wing is the longe&s;t of all. Falconers divide the&s;e birds of &s;port into two cla&s;&s;es; viz. tho&s;e of falconry, properly &s;o called, and tho&s;e of <HI>hawking</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De l'autour&s;erie.</NOTE>: and in this &s;econd cla&s;s they include not only the Gos-hawk, but the Sparrow-hawk, the Har|pies, the Buzzards, &amp;c.

<HEAD>N^o 12. THE GOSHAWK.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="185" REF="214"> The Gos-hawk, before it has &s;hed its
feathers, that is, in its fir&s;t year, is marked on the brea&s;t and belly
with longitudinal brown &s;pots ranged vertically; but after it has had two
moultings, the&s;e di&s;appear, and their place is occupied by tran&s;ver&s;e
bars, which continue during the re&s;t of its life. Hence we are apt to be
deceived with re&s;pect to this bird, from the change that hap|pens in the
di&s;po&s;ition of the colours of the plumage. N^o 461, pl. Eul. is a young
one; N^o 418, and old one.</P>
<P>The Gos-hawk is furni&s;hed with longer legs than other birds to which it bears a clo&s;e analogy; as the White Jer-Falcon, which is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize: the male is much &s;maller than the female: both are carried on the hand, and not u&s;ed as decoys; they &s;oar not &s;o high as tho&s;e who&s;e wings are longer in proportion to their body; they have many habits in common with the Sparrow-hawk, yet they do not dart directly downwards upon their prey, but catch it by a &s;ide &s;hoot. It appears by Belon's account that the Gos-hawk can be en&s;nared by a contriv|ance &s;imilar to what is practi&s;ed again&s;t the Spar|row-hawk. A white pigeon, which can be per|ceived at a great di&s;tance, is placed between four nets, nine or ten feet high, inclo&s;ing a &s;pace of nine or ten feet each way round the pigeon, which is in the centre, the Gos-hawk de&s;cends ob|liquely, (a proof that he makes only &s;ide attacks,) pu&s;hes the net to reach his prize, and though
<PB N="186" REF="215">
entangled, he devours it, and till &s;ated makes few attempts to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Gos-hawk is found in the mountains of Franche Compt&eacute;, of Dauphin&egrave;, of Bugey, and even in the fore&s;ts of the province of Burgundy, and in the neighbourhood of Paris; but it is &s;till more common in Germany than in France, and the &s;pecies &s;eems to penetrate in the countries of the north as far as Sweden, and advance in tho&s;e of the ea&s;t and &s;outh, to Per&s;ia and Bar|bary. Tho&s;e bred in Greece are, according to Belon, the be&s;t of all for falconry. <Q REND="inline">They have,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">a large head, a thick neck, and much plumage. Tho&s;e of Armenia,</Q> he adds, <Q REND="inline">have green eyes; in tho&s;e of Per&s;ia, they are light-coloured, hollow and &s;unk; in tho&s;e of Africa, which are le&s;s e&s;teemed, they are at fir&s;t black, and after moulting, become red.</Q> But this character is not peculiar to the Gos-hawks of Africa; tho&s;e of our own climate have eyes which a&s;&s;ume a deeper red as they advance in age. There is, in the Gos-hawks of France, a difference or variety even of plumage and colour, which has drawn naturali&s;ts into a &s;ort of mi&s;|take. They have applied the name of Moor Buzzard <HI>(Bu&s;ard)</HI> to a Gos-hawk, who&s;e plumage is light-coloured, and which is more indolent than the Brown Gos-hawk, and not &s;o ea&s;ily trained. It is, however, undoubtedly a Gos-hawk, though the falconers reject it. This light-coloured Gos-hawk admits even a &s;light

<P>I kept for a long time a male and a female of the Brown Gos-hawk: the female was at lea&s;t a third larger than the male, and its wings, when clo&s;ed, did not reach within &s;ix inches of the end of the tail: it was more bulky at four months old, which I conceive to be the term of the growth of the&s;e birds, than a large capon. During the fir&s;t five or &s;ix weeks, the&s;e birds were of a grey white; the back, the neck, and the wings, became gradually brown; the belly and the under-part of the throat did not change &s;o much, and were generally white or yellowi&s;h white, with longitudinal brown &s;pots the fir&s;t year, and tran&s;ver&s;e brown bars the following years. The bill is of a dirty blue, and the cere is of a leaden colour; the legs are featherle&s;s, and the toes of a deep yellow; the nails are blacki&s;h, and the feathers of the tail, which are brown, are marked with very broad bars of a dull grey colour. During the fir&s;t year, the feathers under the throat are in the male mottled with a reddi&s;h colour, by which circum&s;tance it differs from the female; though, if we except the &s;ize, it clo&s;ely re&s;embles it in other re|&s;pects.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that though the male was much &s;maller than the female, it was fiercer and
<PB N="188" REF="217">
more vicious; they were both difficult to tame; they fought often, but rather with their claws than with their bill, which they &s;eldom employ but to tear the birds or other &s;mall animals that they want to catch; they turn upon their back and defend them&s;elves with their &s;pread talons. Though confined in the &s;ame cage, they were never perceived to contract the lea&s;t affection for each other. They continued together a whole &s;ummer, from the beginning of May to the end of November, when the female in a violent fit of rage, murdered her mate, at nine or ten o'clock in the evening, when the &s;ilence of night had &s;oothed the re&s;t of the feathered race in profound repo&s;e. Their di&s;po&s;itions are &s;o bloody, that if a Gos-hawk be left with &s;everal Falcons, it butchers them all, one after another. It appears, however, to prefer the common and field mice and &s;mall birds, and eagerly devours raw fle&s;h, but con&s;tantly de|clines meat that has been cooked; however, by long fa&s;ting, it can be brought to overcome this natural aver&s;ion. It plucks the birds very neatly, and tears them into pieces before it feeds; but it &s;wallows the mice entire. Its excrements are whiti&s;h and watery; it often di&s;gorges the &s;kins of the mice rolled together.

<P>THE Jer-falcon, both in its figure and its di&s;po&s;itions, de&s;erves to be ranked the fir&s;t of all the birds of falconry. It exceeds them all in point of &s;ize, being at lea&s;t equal in bulk to the Gos-hawk. It differs from them by certain general and invariable characters which belong exclu&s;ively to tho&s;e peculiarly calculated for &s;port. The&s;e noble birds are, the Jer-falcons, the Falcons, the Sacres, the Lanners, the Hob|bies, the Merlins, and the Ke&s;trils; their wings are almo&s;t as long as their tail; the fir&s;t feather of the wing, called <HI>the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cerceau.</NOTE> <HI>hoop,</HI> is nearly as long as that in&s;erted next it, and about an inch of the extremity is &s;harpened into a figure re|&s;embling the blade of a knife. In the Gos-hawks, the Sparrow-hawks, the Kites, and the Buzzards, the tail is longer than the wings, and the fir&s;t feather of the wing is much &s;horter, and is rounded at the end. Be&s;ides, the longe&s;t feather in the&s;e is the fourth of the wing, but it is the &s;econd in the former. We may add, that the Jer-falcon differs from the Gos-hawk

blui&s;h, and by its plumage, which is brown on all the upper part of the body,
and white &s;potted with brown on the under, and its tail, which is gray, and
barred with du&s;ky lines. (N^o 210, Pl. Enl.) This bird is common in Iceland,
and it appears that there is a variety in the &s;pecies; for we have received
from Norway a Jer-falcon, which is found in all the arctic regions, (N^o 462,
Pl. Enl.) but differs &s;omewhat from the other by the &s;hades and
di&s;tribution of the colours, and which is more e&s;teemed by the falconers
than that of Iceland, on account of its greater courage, ac|tivity, and
docility. But there is another vari|ety, (Pl. Enl. N^o 446.) which is entirely
white, and which, if it were not found alike in all the dreary tracts of the
north, might be a&s;cribed to the influence of the climate. Intelligent
fal|coners inform me, that the young have the &s;ame colour, which they always
retain; we can neither attribute the change therefore to extreme age nor
exce&s;&s;ive cold. It is therefore probable, that there are three di&s;tinct
and permanent breeds of the Jer-falcons; viz. the Iceland Jer-falcon, the
Norwegian Jer-falcon, and the White Jer-falcon. The&s;e birds are natives of
the inho&s;|pitable arctic regions, both in Europe and in A&s;ia; they inhabit
Ru&s;&s;ia, Norway, Iceland, and Tartary, but are never found in the warm or
even temperate countries. Next to the Eagle it is the mo&s;t formidable, the
mo&s;t active, and the <PB N="194" REF="224"> mo&s;t intrepid of all the

comes from Mu&s;covy, whence it is tran&s;ported into Per&s;ia, and which is
almo&s;t as large as an Eagle. The&s;e birds are rare, and only the king is
permitted to keep them. As it is cu&s;tomary in Per&s;ia to e&s;timate all the
pre&s;ents without exception that are made to the king, the&s;e birds are rated
at one hundred <HI>tomans</HI> a-piece, which an&s;wers to one thou&s;and five
hundred crowns; and if any of them die on the road, the amba&s;&s;ador brings
the head and the wings to his maje&s;ty. It is &s;aid that this bird makes its
ne&s;t in the &s;now, which it melts to the ground by the heat of its body,
&s;ometimes to the depth of a fathom, &amp;c. <BIBL>CHARDIN.</BIBL></NOTE>; nor does the
heat of the&s;e climates appear to dimini&s;h its &s;trength or blunt its
vivacity. It boldly attacks the large&s;t of the feathered race; the &s;tork,
the heron, and the crane, are ea&s;y victims: it kills hares by darting
directly down upon them.&mdash;The female, as in the other birds of prey, is

<P>I HAVE removed this bird from the Falcons, and placed it after the Lanner; though &s;ome of our nomenclators con&s;ider it only as a variety of the &s;pecies of Falcons: becau&s;e, if we reckon it a mere variety, we ought to refer it to the Lan|ners rather than to the Falcons. Like the Lan|ner, the feet and bill of the Sacre are blue; while tho&s;e of the Falcons are yellow. This character, which appears &s;pecific, would incline us to conclude that the Sacre is but a variety of the Lanner; but they differ widely in their &s;ize and the colour of their plumage, and &s;eem rather to be two di&s;tinct though proximate kinds. It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular that Belon is the only one who has noticed the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of this bird, and, without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, naturali&s;ts would be &s;carcely, if at all, acquainted with the Sacre and the Lanner. Both have become very rare, and it is probable that their in&s;tincts are the &s;ame, and con&s;equently that they are kindred tribes. But as Belon examined the&s;e birds, and has de&s;cribed them really di&s;tinct, we &s;hall
<PB N="200" REF="231">
tran&s;cribe his account of the Sacre, as we have already done that of the Lanner:&mdash;The plumage of the Sacre is inferior in beauty to that of the other birds of falconry; being of a dirty fer|ruginous colour, like that of the Kite. It is low, its legs and toes blue, in &s;ome degree &s;imi|lar to the Lanner. It would be equal to the Falcon in bulk, were it not more compact and rounder &s;haped. It is a bird of intrepid courage, and comparable in &s;trength to the Pilgrim Falcon; it is al&s;o a bird of pa&s;&s;age, and it is rare to find a man who can boa&s;t that he has ever &s;een the place where it breeds. Some falconers are of opinion that it is a native of Tartary and Ru&s;&s;ia, and towards the Ca&s;pian Sea; that it mi|grates towards the &s;outh, where it lives part of the year; and that it is caught by the falconers who watch its pa&s;&s;age in the i&s;lands of the Ar|chipelago, Rhodes, Cyprus, &amp;c. And as the Sacre can be made to &s;oar after the Kite, it can al&s;o be trained for rural &s;port, to catch wild gee&s;e, <HI>bu&s;tards, olives,</HI> phea&s;ants, partridges, and every &s;ort of game. The <HI>Sacret</HI> is the male, and the <HI>Sacre</HI> the female; the only difference between which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ize.</P>
<P>If we compare this de&s;cription of the Sacre with what the &s;ame author has given of the Lanner, we &s;hall ea&s;ily perceive, fir&s;t, that the&s;e two birds are nearer related to each other than to any other &s;pecies: &s;econdly, that they are birds of pa&s;&s;age; though Belon &s;ays that, in his

time, the Lanner was a native of France, it is almo&s;t certain that it is not now found there: thirdly, that the&s;e two birds &s;eem to differ e&s;&s;entially from the Falcons, becau&s;e their body is rounder, the legs &s;horter, the bill and the feet blue, on which account we have &s;eparated them.</P>
<P>Some years have elap&s;ed &s;ince we cau&s;ed a bird of prey, which we were told was a Sacre, to be figured; but the de&s;cription which was then made has been mi&s;laid, and we cannot re|place it. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;pecific character of the Sacre, <HI>Falco-Sacer,</HI> LINN. is, <Q REND="inline">That its cere and feet are coerulean; the back, brea&s;t, and coverts of the wings, mottled with du&s;ky; the feathers of the tail marked with kidney-&s;haped &s;pots.</Q> It inhabits Europe and Tartary.

di&s;po&s;itions have not, in the lea&s;t, been altered by man; and, though
&s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ures, and flatter|ing to his vanity, they &s;till
retain the native &s;en&s;e of independence, and refu&s;e to multiply and
tran&s;mit po&s;terity under his dominion. The original ferocity of the&s;e
birds is indeed broken by careful attention and multiplied re&s;traints. They
are obliged to purcha&s;e their exi&s;tence by performing ta&s;ks that are
exacted; not a mor&s;el of food is granted but for a &s;ervice received; they
are fixed, pinioned, muffled; they are even excluded from light, and totally
denied &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to render them more dependent, more docile, and to
add to their natural viva|city the urgency of want. But they &s;erve from
nece&s;&s;ity and from habit, not from attachment; they remain captives, but
never become dome&s;|tics; the individual alone feels the weight of &s;lavery;
the &s;pecies pre&s;erves its liberty con&s;tantly untainted, and never owns

the young are adult about the fifteenth of May, and change their colour

<P>The Falcon is perhaps that bird who&s;e cou|rage, compared with its &s;trength, is the mo&s;t open and the mo&s;t con&s;picuous. It darts direct|ly downwards without deviating from the per|pendicular; while the Vulture, and mo&s;t of the other birds of rapine, &s;urpri&s;e their prey by an oblique de&s;cent. It alights vertically upon the feathered victim entangled in nets, kills it, and devours it upon the &s;pot; or, if not too large, it carries the carca&s;s aloft into the air. It prefers phea&s;ants for its prey; and if it di&s;covers a flock of them, it drops &s;uddenly among them as if it fell from the clouds, becau&s;e it de&s;cends from &s;uch an amazing height in &s;o &s;hort a time that its vi&s;it is always unexpected. It frequently at|tacks the Kite, either to amu&s;e its courage, or to

</FIGURE> <PB N="205" REF="238"> &s;eize its prey; but this is rather a
contemptuous in&s;ult than an ob&s;tinate combat. It treats its enemy as a
coward, pur&s;ues it, &s;trikes it with di&s;dain, and as it meets with but
feeble re&s;i&s;t|ance, it allows the Kite to e&s;cape with its life, being as
much di&s;gu&s;ted perhaps with the rank|ne&s;s of its carca&s;s, as
conciliated by the mean|ne&s;s of its conduct.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who inhabit the vicinity of our great mountains in Dauphiny, Bugey, and Auvergne, and the foot of the Alps, can a&s;certain the vera|city of all the&s;e facts. There have been &s;ent to the King's falconry from Geneva young Falcons that had been caught in the adjoining mountains in April, and which appeared to have acquired their full &s;ize and vigour before the month of June. When they are young they are called <HI>Sorrel Falcons,</HI> becau&s;e they are then browner than in the following year (Pl. Enl. N^o 470.); and the old Falcons, which are much whiter than the young, are termed <HI>Haggards</HI> (Pl. Enl. N^o 421.). The Falcon repre&s;ented in the la&s;t plate appears to be hardly two years old, and has &s;till a great number of brown &s;pots on the brea&s;t and belly; for in the third year the&s;e &s;pots dimini&s;h, and the quantity of white on the plumage increa&s;es (Pl. Enl. N^o 430.).</P>
<P>As the&s;e birds every where &s;eek the highe&s;t rocks, and as mo&s;t i&s;lands are but groups and points of mountaints, they abound in Rhodes,
<PB N="206" REF="239">
Cyprus, Malta, and in the other i&s;lands of the Mediterranean, and even in the Orkneys and Iceland: but, according to the different climates which they inhabit, they admit of varieties, which it will be proper to mention.</P>
<P>The Falcon which is a native in France is about the &s;ize of a hen; its extreme length is eighteen inches; its tail is five inches; and its wings when &s;pread are three feet and a half, and when clo&s;ed reach to the end of the tail. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to take notice of the colours of the plumage, becau&s;e they vary with the age. I &s;hall only remark, that the feet are commonly green, and that when the feet and the cere are yellow, they receive the name of <HI>Yellow-billed-Falcons</HI> (Pl. Enl. N^o 430.), and are con&s;idered as inferior to the others, and deemed unfit for the &s;port. The Tiercel is employed to catch par|tridges, magpies, jays, blackbirds, and others of that kind; but the female is engaged in the nobler chace of the hare, the kite, the crane, and other large birds.</P>
<P>It appears that this &s;pecies of Falcon, which is very common in France, is found al&s;o in Germany. Fri&s;ch has given a coloured figure of the Sorrel Falcon with yellow feet and cere, by the name of <HI>Enter-&s;to&s;&s;er,</HI> or <HI>Schwartz-braune Habicht</HI> (i. e. <HI>Plunderer of ducks,</HI> or <HI>Black-brown Hawk</HI>); but he is mi&s;taken in terming it <HI>Brown Gos-hawk (Autour)</HI>; for it differs from that bird
<PB N="207" REF="240">
by its &s;ize and in&s;tincts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This remark of Buffon's &s;eems to be groundle&s;s. The Ger|man word <HI>Habicht</HI> is generic, and &s;ignifies any kind of Hawk. It is probably the &s;ame with the Saxon <HI>Hafoc,</HI> from which the Engli&s;h term <HI>Hawk</HI> is derived. The Wel&s;h appellation <HI>Hoebeg</HI> is &s;till more analogous in regard to &s;ound. T.</NOTE>. It &s;eems that the&s;e occur al&s;o in Germany, and &s;ometimes in France; another &s;pecies, which is the Rough-footed Fal|con with a white head, and which Fri&s;ch impro|perly calls <HI>Vulture.</HI> <Q REND="inline">This Vulture is completely clothed with feathers on the feet, in which cir|cum&s;tance it differs from all the diurnal rapa|cious birds that have a hooked bill. The Rock|eagle is furni&s;hed with &s;imilar feathers, but they only reach half-way to the feet. The nocturnal birds of prey, &s;uch as the owls, are indeed co|vered to the nails; yet this is rather a &s;ort of down. This <HI>Vulture</HI> cha&s;es every kind of prey, though it never grovels among dead carca&s;&s;es.</Q> It feeds not upon carrion, becau&s;e it is not a Vulture but a Falcon; and &s;ome of our natura|li&s;ts have con&s;idered it as only a variety of the common &s;pecies in France. It bears indeed a clo&s;e re&s;emblance, and differs chiefly by the whitene&s;s of its head; but the character, that its feet are covered with feathers to the nails, &s;eems to be &s;pecific, or at lea&s;t to indicate a con&s;tant independent variety.</P>
<P>A &s;econd variety is the White Falcon, which occurs in Ru&s;&s;ia, and perhaps in other countries of the north. Some of this &s;ort are of an uni|form white, except at the ends of the great fea|thers
<PB N="208" REF="241">
of the wings, which are blacki&s;h; others are al&s;o entirely white, except a few brown &s;pots on the back and wings, and a few brown &s;tripes on the tail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on.</NOTE>. Since this Falcon differs from the common kind in nothing but the whitene&s;s of its plumage, we may con&s;ider it as merely a va|riety occa&s;ioned by the general influence of ex|treme cold. Yet in Iceland there are Falcons which have the &s;ame colour with ours, and are only &s;omewhat larger, and have their wings and tail longer: the&s;e then ought not to be &s;eparated from the common &s;pecies. The &s;ame remark may be made in regard to the <HI>Genteel Falcon,</HI> which mo&s;t naturali&s;ts have &s;tated as different; in fact, the epithet <HI>Genteel</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gentle,</HI> in old Engli&s;h.</NOTE> is applied when the bird is high bred, and of an elegant &s;hape. Accordingly the old writers on falconry reckon|ed only two kinds of Falcons; the Genteel Fal|con, which is bred in our climates, and the Pilgrim or Peregrine Falcon, which is of foreign extraction; and they regarded all the others as varieties of either of the&s;e. Some Falcons in|deed from foreign countries pay us tran&s;ient vi|&s;its; they appear mo&s;tly on the &s;outhern &s;hores, and are caught at Malta; they are for that rea|&s;on called the <HI>Pa&s;&s;enger Falcons,</HI> and are much blacker than the common kind. It would ap|pear that this Black Falcon enters into Germany as well as France; for it is the &s;ame with the <HI>Brown Falcon</HI> of Fri&s;ch. It even penetrates to
<PB N="209" REF="242">
more di&s;tant climates; and Edwards has figured and de&s;cribed it under the name of the <HI>Black Falcon of Hud&s;on's-bay.</HI></P>
<P>To the &s;ame &s;pecies we may al&s;o refer the Falcon of Tunis or Carthage, mentioned by Belon, <Q REND="inline">which,</Q> he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">is rather &s;maller than the Pilgrim Falcon, its head thicker and rounder, and in its bulk and plumage like the Lanner.</Q> The Tartary Falcon ought perhaps to have the &s;ame arrangement; which is on the contrary &s;omewhat larger than the Pilgrim Falcon, and is repre&s;ented by Belon to differ in another circum&s;tance, that the upper part of its wings is ru&s;ty, and its toes longer.</P>
<P>To give a conden&s;ed view of the facts which we have con&s;idered in detail: 1. There is in France only one &s;pecies of Falcon well known, and which con&s;tructs its aerie in the mountain|ous provinces: the &s;ame is found al&s;o in Ger|many, Poland, Sweden, and as far as Iceland, to the north; and in Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, Spain, the i&s;lands in the Mediterranean, and perhaps Egypt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;per Alpinus.</NOTE>, to the &s;outh. 2. The White Falcon is merely a variety of the &s;ame &s;pecies, produced by the influence of a northern climate. 3. The Genteel Falcon is of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the common kind<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John of Franchieres, who is one of our olde&s;t writers on fal|conry, and perhaps the be&s;t, reckons only &s;even &s;pecies of Falcons; viz. the Genteel Falcon, the Peregrine Falcon, the Tartarian Fal|con, the Jer-falcon, the Sacre, the Lanner, and the Tuni|&s;ian Falcon. If we omit the Jer-falcon, the Sacre, and the Lan|ner, which are not Falcons, there remain only the Genteel Falcon and the Peregrine Falcon, of which the Falcons of Tartary and Tunis are two varieties. This author knew only one &s;pecies of Falcon that was a native of France, which he calls the <HI>Genteel Falcon</HI>; and this circum&s;tance confirms what I have before &s;aid, that the Genteel and Common Falcons are really the &s;ame &s;pecies.</NOTE>. 4. The Pilgrim or Pa&s;&s;enger Falcon is
<PB N="210" REF="243">
of a different &s;pecies, and perhaps includes &s;ome varieties; &s;uch as the Barbary Falcon, the Tunis Falcon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Whatever then the &s;tatement of our nomen|clators may be, there are only two kinds of Fal|cons in Europe, the one native and the other to be regarded as foreign. If we &s;urvey the numerous catalogue which Bri&s;&s;on has given, we &s;hall find, 1. That his Sorrel Falcon is only the young of the common &s;pecies: 2. That his Haggard Falcon is an old one of the &s;ame: 3. That his Falcon with a white head and rough feet, is a permanent variety of the &s;ame kind: 4. That his White Falcon comprehends two, perhaps three, different &s;pecies of birds; the fir&s;t and third of which may derive their colour from the general influence of the arctic climates, but the &s;econd, which Bri&s;&s;on borrows from Fri&s;ch, is undoubtedly not a Falcon, and is only a bird of prey common in France, and named the <HI>Harpy:</HI> 5. That the Black Falcon is the true Pilgrim or Pa&s;&s;enger Falcon, which may be re|garded as foreign: 6. That the Spotted Falcon
<PB N="211" REF="244">
is only the young of the &s;ame: 7. That the Brown Falcon ought rather to be reckoned a Moor Buzzard: Fri&s;ch is the only one who has given a figure of it, and he ob&s;erves that it &s;ome|times &s;eizes wild pigeons in its flight; that it &s;oars high; that it is difficult to &s;hoot, and yet that it watches the aquatic birds near pools and mar&s;hes:&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances combined would &s;hew that it is only a variety of the Moor Buzzards, though its tail is not &s;o long as theirs: 8. That his Red Falcon is only a variety of the Common Falcon, which, Belon and the old writers on falconry &s;ay, frequents the fenny tracts: 9. That his Red Indian Falcon is a foreign bird, of which we &s;hall afterwards treat: 10. That his Ita|lian Falcon, the account of which he borrows from John&s;ton, may be regarded as a variety of the common &s;pecies of Falcon inhabiting the Alps: 11. That his Iceland Falcon is, as we have al|ready remarked, another variety of the Common Falcon, and only &s;omewhat larger: 12. That the Sacre is not a variety of the Falcon, but a different &s;pecies, which mu&s;t be treated of &s;e|parately: 13. That his Genteel Falcon is really the Common Falcon, only de&s;cribed at a different &s;ea&s;on of moulting: 14. That Bri&s;&s;on's Pilgrim Falcon is the &s;ame, only aged: 15. That the Barbary Falcon is but a variety of the Foreign or Pa&s;&s;enger Falcon: 16. And that &s;o is the Tartary Falcon: 17. That the Collared Falcon is a bird of a different genus, which we have
<PB N="212" REF="245">
termed <HI>Soubu&s;e</HI> (Ring tail): 18. That the Rock Falcon is not a Falcon, but is mo&s;t related to the Hobby and Ke&s;tril, and &s;hould therefore be con|&s;idered apart: 19. That the Mountain Falcon is only a variety of the Rock Falcon: 20. That the Cinereous Rock Falcon is only a variety of the common &s;pecies of Falcon: 21. That the Hud&s;on's Bay Falcon is of a different &s;pecies from the European: 22. That the Stellated Falcon is of a different genus: 23. That the Cre&s;ted Falcon of India, the Falcon of the An|tilles, the Fi&s;her Falcon of the Antilles, and the Fi&s;her Falcon of Carolina, are all foreign birds, of which we &s;hall treat in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Thus the Falcons are reduced to two &s;pecies; the Common or Genteel Falcon, and the Pa&s;|&s;enger or Pilgrim Falcon.&mdash;Let us now con|&s;ult our old writers on falconry in regard to the difference of their in&s;tincts, and in the pro|per mode of education. The Genteel Falcon drops its feathers in March, and even earlier; the Pilgrim Falcon does not moult until Augu&s;t. It is broader over the &s;houlders, its eyes are larger and deeper &s;unk, its bill thicker, its legs longer and better &s;et than in the Genteel Fal|con<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Artelouche's Falconry</BIBL>, printed along with the treati&s;es of Fouilloux, Franchieres, and Tardif. <HI>Paris</HI> 1614.</NOTE>: tho&s;e caught in the ne&s;t are called <HI>Ninny Falcons (Faucons-niais)</HI>; when taken too young, they are often noi&s;y and difficult to train; they ought not therefore to be di&s;turbed till they are
<PB N="213" REF="246">
con&s;iderably grown; and if they are to be re|moved from the ne&s;t, they mu&s;t not be handled, but put into another ne&s;t as like the original one as po&s;&s;ible, and fed with bears fle&s;h, which is common in the mountains where the&s;e birds are found, or in&s;tead of that, they may be nouri&s;hed with the fle&s;h of chickens: without the&s;e pre|cautions, their wings do not grow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catalogue of all the birds of prey employed in falconry, con|tained in the preceding collection.</NOTE>, and their legs are ea&s;ily broken or di&s;located. The Sorrel Falcons, which are the young ones, and which have been caught in September, October, and November, are the be&s;t, and the ea&s;ie&s;t bred: tho&s;e which are caught later, in winter or in the following &s;pring, and con&s;equently are nine or ten months old, have ta&s;ted too much of freedom to &s;ubmit patiently to captivity, and their fidelity or obedience can never be relied on; they often de&s;ert their ma&s;ter when he lea&s;t ex|pects it. The Pilgrim Falcons are caught in their pa&s;&s;age every year in September on the i&s;lands in the &s;ea, and the high beaches by the &s;hore. They are naturally quick and docile, and very ea&s;y to train; they may be flown all May and June; for they are late in moulting; but when it begins, they are &s;oon &s;tripped of their plumage. The Pilgrim Falcons are caught not only on the coa&s;ts of Barbary, but in all the i&s;lands of the Mediterranean, and particularly
<PB N="214" REF="247">
that of Candia, which formerly furni&s;hed our be&s;t Falcons.</P>
<P>The art of falconry does not belong to Natural Hi&s;tory; we &s;hall not therefore enter into details, but refer to the <HI>Encyclopedie</HI> for information on that &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline">A good Falcon,</Q> &s;ays Le Roi, author of the article of <HI>falconry,</HI> <Q REND="inline">ought to have a round head, a &s;hort thick bill, a very long neck, &s;inewy brea&s;t, broad long thighs, &s;hort legs, broad feet, &s;lender toes, that are lengthened and &s;inewy at the joints, &s;trong incurvated nails, long wings: the marks of &s;trength and courage are the &s;ame in the Jer-falcon and the Tiercel, which is the male in all the rapacious birds, and which is &s;o called, becau&s;e it is one third le&s;s than the female. A more certain indication of the goodne&s;s of the bird, is its riding <HI>(chevaucher)</HI> again&s;t the wind; that is, bri&s;tling again&s;t it, and &s;itting firm on the hand when expo&s;ed to it. The plumage of a Falcon &s;hould be brown and of an uniform colour: the proper ca&s;t of the &s;ole is &s;ea-green. Tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ole is yellow, and who&s;e plumage is &s;potted, are le&s;s e&s;teemed; the black ones are prized: but whatever be their plumage, the bolde&s;t are the be&s;t. . . . Some Falcons are lazy and cow|ardly; others are of &s;o fiery a temper, that they can bear no re&s;traint; both the&s;e kinds are to be rejected,</Q> &amp;c.</P>

The age of Falcons is marked very preci&s;ely in the &s;e|cond year, that is, at the fir&s;t moulting; but afterwards it is much more difficult to di&s;|tingui&s;h it.

<P>The Black Falcon is a bird of pa&s;&s;age at Malta, in France, and in Germany, which Fri&s;ch and Edwards have figured and de&s;cribed, and which appears to us of a different &s;pecies from our Common Falcon. I may ob&s;erve, that the ac|count given by Edwards is accurate, but that Fri&s;ch had no foundation for a&s;&s;erting that this Falcon is undoubtedly the &s;tronge&s;t of all the rapacious birds that are of an equal &s;ize, becau&s;e its upper mandible terminates in a &s;ort of &s;harp tooth; and that it has larger toes and nails than the other Falcons; for we found upon com|pari&s;on, that in regard to the toes and nails, it differed nothing from other Falcons; and in mo&s;t of the&s;e the upper mandible had a &s;imilar termina|tion; &s;o that the marks of di&s;tinction which Fri&s;ch a&s;&s;igns are fal&s;e or nugatory.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="252">
The Spotted Falcon, of which Edwards gives a figure and de&s;cription, and which he tells us came from the &s;ame country with the Black Fal|con, that is, from Hud&s;on's Bay, appears to be only the Sorrel Falcon, or the young of the &s;ame &s;pecies; it owes its colours therefore to the difference of age, and not to any ab&s;olute di&s;|tinction of kind. We have been a&s;&s;ured that mo&s;t of the Black Falcons arrive from the &s;outh; and yet we have &s;een one which was caught on the coa&s;t of North America, near the banks of Newfoundland. Edwards tells us, that it is found in the country about Hud&s;on's Bay. We may therefore conclude that the &s;pecies is widely &s;cat|tered, and that it vi&s;its alike the warm, the temperate, and the cold climates.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve, that in the bird which we &s;aw, the feet were of a di&s;tinct blue, while in tho&s;e figured by Fri&s;ch and Edwards, they are yellow; yet there is no doubt but the birds are the &s;ame. We have noticed &s;ome O&s;preys which had blue feet, and others which had them yel|low; this character is therefore not &s;o con&s;tant as generally &s;uppo&s;ed.

<P>The bird mentioned by Willoughby under the name of <HI>The cirrated Indian Falcon,</HI> which is larger than the Common Falcon, and near|ly of the &s;ize of the Gos-hawk; which has a cre&s;t divided at the extremity into two parts, that are pendent on the neck. It is black on all the upper parts of the head and body; but on the brea&s;t and belly, the uniformity of colour is interrupted by lines, which are alternately black and white; the feathers of the tail rayed with lines alternately black and cinereous; but the feet are feathered to the toes; the iris, the cere, and the feet, are yellow; the bill is of a blacki&s;h blue, and the nails are of a fine black.</P>
<P>In general it appears from the relations of travellers, that the genus of the Falcons is one of the mo&s;t univer&s;ally di&s;per&s;ed. We have already ob&s;erved that it is found through the whole extent of Europe, in the i&s;lands of the Mediterranean, and on the &s;hores of Barbary. Dr. Shaw, who&s;e narrative I find to be almo&s;t always faithful and accurate, tells us, that in the kingdom of Tunis there are Falcons and Sparrow-hawks in abundance, and that they form one of the principal amu&s;ements of the Arabs, and of the people of ea&s;ier circum&s;tances.

<P>The Per&s;ians are expert in training birds for the chace; and they generally in&s;truct the Falcons to fly at all &s;orts of birds; and for this purpo&s;e they take cranes and other birds, and putting out their eyes, they &s;et them at liberty, and immediately let loo&s;e the Falcon, which ea&s;ily catches them. . . . There are al&s;o Falcons for the chace of antelopes: they are trained in the following manner: They make the Falcons con&s;tantly eat off the no&s;e of &s;tuffed ante|lopes, and &s;uffer them to feed no where el&s;e. After the birds are thus bred, they carry them into the fields, and when they di&s;cover an antelope, they let loo&s;e two of them, one of which fa&s;tens on the face of the bea&s;t, and &s;trikes it before with the feet. The antelope &s;tops &s;hort, and endeavours to &s;hake off the Falcon, which claps its wings to keep its hold, and thus retards the flight of the antelope. When after much &s;truggling the Falcon is di&s;engaged, another &s;ucceeds; and thus the antelope is continually hara&s;&s;ed and detained, until the dogs have time to overtake it. The&s;e &s;ports are the more plea|&s;ant as the country is flat and open, and little interrupted by wood. <HI>Relation de Thevenot. . . . Voyage de Jean Ovington.</HI></P> 
<P>The way in which the Per&s;ians breed the Falcons to the cha&s;e of wild deer is, to &s;kin one and &s;tuff it with &s;traw, and to fa&s;ten the fle&s;h with which they feed Falcons always on the head of the &s;tuffed animal, which is moved along on a four-wheeled vehicle in order to accu&s;tom the bird. . . . If the bea&s;t is large, they fly &s;everal birds at it, which tea&s;e it one after another. . . . They al&s;o u&s;e the&s;e birds in rivers and mar&s;hes, into which they enter like dogs to hunt for the game. . . . As all the military people are &s;port&s;men, they u&s;ually carry at the pommel of the &s;addle a &s;mall tymbal of eight or nine inches in diameter, and by &s;triking it they recal the bird. <HI>Voyage de Chardin.</HI></P> 
<P>Per&s;ia has al&s;o birds of prey; there are many Falcons, Sparrow-hawks, and Lanners, with which the royal venery is provided, amounting to more than eight hundred. Some are flown at the wild boar, the wild a&s;s, and the antelope; others are intended again&s;t cranes, herons, gee&s;e, and partridges. A great part of the&s;e birds of &s;port are brought from Ru&s;&s;ia; but the large&s;t and be&s;t come from the mountains which &s;tretch towards the &s;outh from Schyras unto the Gulph of Per&s;ia. <HI>Dampier's Voyage.</HI></P></NOTE>, where it is &s;aid falconry <PB N="221" REF="256"> is &s;tudied

<P>THE Hobby is much &s;maller than the Falcon, and of a different di&s;po&s;ition. The fiery courage of the Falcon prompts him to attack birds that are far &s;uperior in &s;ize; but the cau|tious Hobby, unle&s;s it is trained to the chace, never a&s;pires beyond the prey of larks and quails. The want of boldne&s;s, however, is compen&s;ated by its indu&s;try. No &s;ooner does it e&s;py the &s;port&s;man and his dog than it hovers in the train, and endeavours to catch the &s;mall birds that are put up before them; and what e&s;capes the fowling-piece eludes not the Hobby. It &s;eems not intimidated by the noi&s;e of fire-arms, and ignorant of their fatal effects; for it con|tinues to keep clo&s;e to the per&s;on who &s;hoots. It frequents the champaign country near woods, e&s;pecially where the larks are numerous. It commits great havoc among them, and the&s;e are well apprized of their fatal enemy; they are alarmed when they de&s;cry it, and in&s;tantly dive into the bu&s;hes, or &s;eek concealment in the
<PB N="224" REF="260">
herbage. This is the only way in which the lark can effect its e&s;cape; for though it &s;oars to a great height, the Hobby can &s;till out&s;trip it. The Hobby lodges and breeds in the fore&s;ts, and perches upon the talle&s;t trees. In &s;ome of our provinces the name of <HI>Hobby</HI> is applied to the petty barons who tyrannize over their pea|&s;ants, and more particularly to gentlemen of the &s;port who chu&s;e to hunt on their neighbours' grounds without obtaining leave, and who hunt le&s;s for plea&s;ure than for profit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This application of the name <HI>Hobby</HI> to country gentlemen might al&s;o be owing to another circum&s;tance. Tho&s;e who were not rich enough to keep Falcons were contented with breeding Hobbies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve, that in this &s;pecies the plu|mage is blacker during the fir&s;t year than in the &s;ucceeding ones. In France there is a variety of the Hobby, which is repre&s;ented Pl. Enl. N^o 431. The difference con&s;i&s;ts in this; that the throat, the lower part of the neck, the brea&s;t, a part of the belly, and the great fea|thers of the wings, are cinereous and without &s;pots; whereas, in the Common Hobby, the throat and the lower part of the neck are white, the brea&s;t and the upper part of the belly are white al&s;o, with longitudinal brown &s;pots, and the great feathers of the wings are almo&s;t blac|ki&s;h. The tail, which in the common &s;pecies is whiti&s;h below, da&s;hed with brown, is in the va|riety entirely brown. But notwith&s;tanding &s;uch
<PB N="225" REF="261">
differences, the&s;e two birds are &s;till of the &s;ame kind; for their &s;ize and port are the &s;ame, and they are both natives of France; and be&s;ides, they have in common a &s;ingular character, that the lower part of the belly and the thighs are covered with feathers of a bright ru&s;t-colour, and which is &s;trongly contra&s;ted with the re&s;t of the plumage. It is even not unlikely that all this diver&s;ity of colours ari&s;es from the age or the &s;ea&s;on of moulting.&mdash;We have only to add, that the Hobby is carried on the hand without any cover or hood like the Merlin, the Spar|row-hawk, and Gos-hawk, and that it was for|merly much u&s;ed in hunting partridges and quails. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;pecific character of the Hobby, <HI>Falco Subbuteo:</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">The cere and feet yellow, the back du&s;ky, the nape of the neck white, the abdomen pale with du&s;ky oblong &s;pots, the under &s;ide of the rump and the thighs rufous.</Q></P> 
<P>The male weighs &s;even ounces; the length twelve inches; the alar extent two feet &s;even inches. It inhabits Europe and Siberia. In &s;ummer it is frequent in England, where it breeds, and migrates in October.</P> 
<P>It has been mentioned in the text, that the larks dread the &s;ight of the Hobby. They remain fixed to the ground through fear, which affords the fowler an opportunity of &s;preading his net over them. This was formerly practi&s;ed, and termed <HI>daring</HI> the larks.</P>

<P>THE Ke&s;trel is one of the mo&s;t common of the birds of prey in France, and e&s;pecially in Burgundy. There is &s;carcely an old ca&s;tle or de&s;erted tower, but is inhabited by it; and in the mornings and evenings particularly it is &s;een flying about the ruins. It is &s;till oftener heard; it con&s;tantly repeats, when on the wing, its quick <HI>pl&ibreve;, pl&ibreve;, pl&ibreve;,</HI> or <HI>pr&ibreve;, pr&ibreve;, pr&ibreve;,</HI> and terrifies all the &s;mall birds, on which it &s;hoots like an arrow,

</FIGURE> <PB N="227" REF="264"> and &s;eizes them with its talons; or if it
mi&s;&s;es the fir&s;t dart, it pur&s;ues them without fear even to the
hou&s;es: I have known my &s;ervants more than once catch the Ke&s;trel and its
little fugitive, by opening the window or the hall door, which was more than
one hundred fathoms from the old walls where the pur&s;uit commenced. After it
has &s;ecured its prey, it kills it, and plucks the feathers neatly; but it is
not at &s;uch pains with mice, for it &s;wallows the &s;mall ones entire, and
tears the large ones into pieces. The &s;oft parts of the carca&s;e are
dige&s;ted in the &s;tomach of the bird, but the &s;kin is rolled into a ball,
and re|jected at the bill. Its excrements are almo&s;t liquid, and whiti&s;h;
and the rolls that are thrown out are found, by &s;oaking in warm water, to be
the entire &s;kins of the mice. The Owls, Buz|zards, and perhaps many other
kinds of rapa|cious birds, reject al&s;o &s;imilar balls, which, be|&s;ides the
&s;kin, contain often the harde&s;t portions of the bones. The &s;ame is the
ca&s;e with Fi&s;her|birds; the bones and &s;cales of the fi&s;hes are
col|lected in the &s;tomach, and thrown out at the bill.</P>
<P>The Ke&s;trel is a pretty bird; its &s;ight is acute, its flight ea&s;y and well &s;upported: it has per&s;e|verance and courage, and re&s;embles in its in|&s;tinct the noble and generous birds; and per|haps it might be trained, like the Merlins, for falconry. The female is larger than the male: its head is ru&s;t-coloured, the upper &s;ide of its
<PB N="228" REF="265">
back, wings, and tail marked with cro&s;s bars of brown, and all the feathers of the tail are of a ru&s;ty brown variou&s;ly inten&s;e; but in the male, the head and tail are grey, and the upper parts of the back and wings are of a vinous ru&s;t colour, &s;prinkled with a few &s;mall black &s;pots.</P>
<P>We cannot omit to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome of our modern nomenclators have termed the female Ke&s;trel the <HI>Lark-hawk (epervier des alouettes),</HI> and have reckoned it a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the Ke&s;trel.</P>
<P>Though this bird habitually frequents old buildings, it breeds &s;eldomer in the&s;e than in the woods: and when it depo&s;its its eggs neither in the holes of walls nor in the cavities of trees, it con&s;tructs a very flim&s;y &s;ort of ne&s;t, compo&s;ed of &s;ticks and roots, pretty much like that of the jays, upon the talle&s;t trees of the fore&s;t; &s;ome|times it occupies the ne&s;ts de&s;erted by the crows. It lays four eggs, but oftener five, and &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even; of which the two ends have a reddi&s;h or yellowi&s;h tinge &s;imilar to the plumage. Its young are at fir&s;t covered with a white down, and fed with in&s;ects; they are afterwards &s;up|plied with plenty of field mice, which it de&s;cries from aloft, as it hovers or wheels &s;lowly round, and on which it in&s;tantly darts. Sometimes it carries off a red partridge, which is much heavier than it&s;elf, and often catches pigeons that &s;tray from the flock. But, be&s;ides field mice and reptiles, its ordinary prey are &s;parrows, chaffinches, and
<PB N="229" REF="266">
other &s;mall birds. As it is more prolific than mo&s;t of the rapacious tribe, the &s;pecies is more nu|merous and wider diffu&s;ed; it is found through the whole extent of Europe, from Sweden to Italy and Spain, and it occurs even in the more temperate parts of North America. Many Ke&s;trels continue the whole year in France; but I have ob&s;erved that they are much le&s;s fre|quent in winter than in &s;ummer, which induces me to think, that &s;everal migrate into other countries to pa&s;s the inclement &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have rai&s;ed numbers of the&s;e birds in large volaries: they are, as I have already ob&s;erved, of a very fine white during the fir&s;t month; after which the feathers on the back become ru&s;ty or brown in a few days: they are hardy, and ea&s;y to feed; they eat raw fle&s;h when it is offered to them, when they are a fortnight or three weeks old. They &s;oon become acquainted with the per&s;on who takes care of them, and grow &s;o tame as never to give offence: they early acquire their cry, and repeat the &s;ame in confinement as in the &s;tate of liberty.&mdash;I have often known them e&s;cape, and return of their own accord after a day or two's ab&s;ence, pro|bably compelled by hunger.</P>
<P>I am acquainted with no varieties of this &s;pe|cies, except a few, in which the head and the two feathers of the middle of the tail are gray, &s;uch as figured by Fri&s;ch; but Salerne mentions a yellow Ke&s;trel, which is found in Sologne,
<PB N="230" REF="267">
and of which the eggs are of the &s;ame yellow hue. <Q REND="inline">This Ke&s;trel,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">is rare, and fights nobly with the White John, which, though &s;tronger, is often forced to yield the conte&s;t; they have been &s;een,</Q> he adds, <Q REND="inline">to hook together in the air, and fall to the ground like a clod or a &s;tone.</Q> This appears to me very improbable; for not only is the White John much &s;uperior to the Ke&s;trel in &s;trength, but its movements are performed &s;o differently, that the birds could &s;carcely ever meet. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;pecific character of the Ke&s;trel, <HI>Falco Tinnunculus,</HI> LINN. is, <Q REND="inline">that the cere and feet are yellowi&s;h; the back rufous, with black points; the brea&s;t marked with du&s;ky &s;treaks; the tail rounded.</Q></P> 
<P>It was formerly trained in Great Britain, to catch &s;mall birds and young partridges, but laid a&s;ide when falconry fell into di&s;u&s;e.</P> 
<P>It is frequent in the de&s;erts of Tartary and Siberia, and breeds in the &s;mall trees &s;cattered through the open country. It appears in Sweden early in the &s;pring, and departs in September. It is uncertain whether it penetrates farther north.</P></NOTE></P>

The great inequality of &s;ize therefore ob&s;erved be|tween the &s;exes in birds of prey, cannot be at|tributed to the mode of life, or to any peculiar habit: it would &s;eem at fir&s;t to depend upon the magnitude; for, in the Butcher-birds, which are &s;till &s;maller than the Merlins, the males and
<PB N="234" REF="274">
females are of the &s;ame &s;ize; while, in the Eagles, the Vultures, the Jer-falcons, the Gos-hawks, the Falcons, and the Sparrow-hawks, the female is a third larger than the male. Upon con&s;ulting the accounts of the di&s;&s;ection of birds, I find that mo&s;t females have a large double <HI>caecum,</HI> while the males have only one <HI>caecum,</HI> and &s;ometimes none at all: this difference of the internal &s;tructure, which is much more frequent in the females than in the males, is per|haps the true phy&s;ical cau&s;e of this exuberant growth. I &s;hall leave it to anatomi&s;ts to a&s;certain the fact more accurately.</P>
<P>The Merlin flies low, though with great ce|lerity and ea&s;e: it frequents woods and bu&s;hes to &s;eize the &s;mall birds, and hunts alone una&s;|&s;i&s;ted by its female: it breeds in the mountain fore&s;ts, and lays five or &s;ix eggs.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the one we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed, there is another kind of Merlin better known by naturali&s;ts, which Fri&s;ch has figured and Bri&s;&s;on de&s;cribed from nature. This differs con|&s;iderably from the former, and &s;eems to re&s;em|ble more the Ke&s;trel; at lea&s;t, if we may judge from the figure, not being able to procure a &s;pe|cimen. But another circum&s;tance &s;eems to coun|tenance this opinion: the American birds, which we received by the name of the <HI>Cayenne Merlin</HI> (Pl. Enl. N^o 444), and the <HI>St. Domingo Merlin</HI> (Pl. Enl. N^o 465), appear to be varieties, or per|haps the male and female, of the &s;ame &s;pecies,
<PB N="235" REF="275">
and, when viewed attentively, di&s;cover more re|&s;emblance to the Ke&s;trel than to the Merlin of the falconers. This would imply, that the Ke&s;trel has migrated into the new continent; and ac|cordingly, as a further pre&s;umption, Linnaeus ranks it among the natives of Sweden, while he omits the Merlin. We may therefore di&s;tingui&s;h it by a particular name, and that given it in the Antilles may not be improper. <Q REND="inline">The Merlin,</Q> &s;ays Father Tertre, <Q REND="inline">which our &s;ettlers call <HI>gry-gry,</HI> from the cries which it makes in flying, is another &s;mall bird of prey that is &s;carcely larger than a thru&s;h: all the feathers on the upper &s;ide of the back and wings are ru&s;ty, &s;potted with black; the under &s;ide of the belly is white, &s;peckled with ermine: it is armed with a bill and talons proportioned to its &s;ize: it preys only on &s;mall lizards and gra&s;s-hoppers, and &s;ometimes on young chick|ens newly hatched: I have frequently re&s;cued them; the hen makes a &s;tout defence, and drives off its enemy.&mdash;The &s;ettlers eat it, but it is not very fat.</Q></P>

<P>THOUGH the&s;e birds are &s;mall and of a delicate make, yet their courage, their appetite for carnage, and their large hooked bill, entitle them to be ranked with the bolde&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;an|guinary of the rapacious tribe: it is a&s;toni&s;hing with what intrepidity the little Shrikes combat the Magpies, the Crows, and the Ke&s;trels, which are all much larger and &s;tronger than them&s;elves. Not only do they act on the defen&s;ive, but they &s;ometimes commence the attack; and they are ever &s;ucce&s;sful in the rencounter, e&s;pecially when the parents unite to drive the birds of prey to a di&s;tance from their ne&s;t. If they fly near their retreats, the Shrikes ru&s;h upon them with loud cries, inflict terrible wounds, and force them to retire with little inclination to repeat the vi&s;it. The more generous of the rapacious tribe regard them with re&s;pect, and the Kites, the Buzzards, and the Crows &s;eem rather intimidated at their appearance. Nothing in nature can give a bet|ter idea of the privileges annexed to courage,
<PB N="238" REF="278">
than to &s;ee the&s;e little birds, &s;carcely equal in &s;ize to the larks, flying with &s;ecurity among the Sparrow-hawks, the Falcons, and other tyrants of the air, and hunting in their domains with|out apprehending danger: for, though they commonly live upon in&s;ects, they prefer fle&s;h; they cha&s;e all the &s;mall birds upon wing, and they &s;ometimes catch partridges and young hares. Thru&s;hes, black-birds, and other birds caught in the noo&s;e, are their common prey; they fix on them with their talons, &s;plit the &s;kull with their bill, &s;queeze or cut the neck, and then pluck off the feathers, and feed at their lei&s;ure, and tran&s;|port the mangled fragments to their ne&s;ts.</P>

<P>THIS bird is very common in France, where it continues during the whole year. It in|habits the woods and mountains in &s;ummer, and re&s;orts to the plains and near our dwellings in winter. It breeds among the hills, either on the ground or on the loftie&s;t trees. Its ne&s;t is com|po&s;ed of white mo&s;s interwoven with long gra&s;s, and well lined with wool, and is commonly fa&s;tened to the triple cleft of a branch. The female, which differs not from the male in point of &s;ize, and is only di&s;tingui&s;hed by the lighter ca&s;t of its plumage, lays generally five or &s;ix eggs,
<PB N="240" REF="281">
&s;ometimes &s;even or even eight, as large as tho&s;e of a thru&s;h. She feeds her young at fir&s;t with cater|pillars and other in&s;ects, but &s;oon in&s;tructs them to eat bits of fle&s;h, which her mate brings with wonderful care and attention. Very different from the other birds of prey, which expel their helple&s;s brood, the Shrike treats its infant young with the mo&s;t tender affection, and even after they are grown &s;till retains its attachment. To|wards autumn the offspring a&s;&s;i&s;t the parents in providing for the common &s;upport; and the members of the family continue during winter to live in harmony, till the genial influence of &s;pring awakens the appetite for propagation, and forms other unions.</P>
<P>The Shrikes may be di&s;tingui&s;hed both by their flying in &s;mall troops after the breeding &s;ea&s;on, and by their zig-zag cour&s;e, which waves not &s;ideways, but bends with &s;udden flexures upwards and downwards. They are al&s;o di&s;covered by their &s;hrill cry <HI>tr&obreve;ui~, tr&obreve;ui~,</HI> which can be heard at a great di&s;tance, and which they ince&s;&s;antly repeat when perched on the &s;ummits of trees.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t &s;pecies there is a variety in the &s;ize, and another in the colour. We have re|ceived for the King's cabinet a Shrike from Italy, which differs from the common kind only by a ru&s;ty tinge on the brea&s;t and belly (Pl. Enl. N^o 32, Fig. 1.). Some are found entirely white on the

Alps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lanius Albus,</HI> ALDROV. This is the &s;econd variety of Lin|naeus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Its body white; its feet yellowi&s;h; the bill and nails blacki&s;h.</Q></NOTE>, which, as well as tho&s;e with a rufous tinge on the belly, are of

<HI>Groe&s;erer Neuntoeder</HI> of FRISCH. It is the third variety of
<HI>Lanius Excubitor,</HI> LINN. It is larger and thicker than the former; the
&s;capular feathers, and the &s;mall coverts of the upper &s;ide of the wing,
are ru&s;ty-coloured: But the&s;e differences are too minute to con&s;titute a
&s;eparate &s;pecies.</NOTE>. But others are found in Ger|many and Switzerland
which are &s;omewhat larger, and which &s;everal naturali&s;ts have rec|koned a
different &s;pecies; yet in other re&s;pects the&s;e birds are &s;imilar, and
their growth might be affected by the plenty or &s;carcity of
&s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence which the country affords. And if the Great Cinereous Shrike
varies &s;omewhat in Europe, we may expect it to vary &s;till more in remote
climates. That of Loui&s;iana (Fig. 2, N^o 476, Pl. Enl.) is the &s;ame with
the common kind, differing le&s;s than the Italian bird; only it is rather
&s;maller, and of a deeper ca&s;t on the upper parts of the body. Tho&s;e from
the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
To this &s;pecies we mu&s;t al&s;o refer the Ea&s;t-India bird which the Engli&s;h that vi&s;it the coa&s;ts of Bengal term the <HI>Dial-bird,</HI> and which is de&s;cribed by Albin with figures of the cock and hen. <Q REND="inline">This Shrike is very large, he &s;ays, and very &s;imilar to the Great Cinereous Shrike; its bill black, the corners of the mouth yellow, the iris of the &s;ame colour, the legs and feet brown.

The female is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the male by its fainter colours.</Q></NOTE> (Fig. 1, N^o 477), and Senegal <PB N="242" REF="283"> (Fig. 1. N^o
297), and the Blue Shrike from Ma|daga&s;car (Fig. 1, N^o 298), appear to be
three contiguous varieties, and equally related to the Great Cinereous Shrike
of Europe. The only differences are, that in the one from the Cape, the upper
parts of the body are of a blacki&s;h brown; in that from Senegal, they are of
a lighter brown; and in that from Madaga&s;car, they are of a fine blue: but
&s;uch differences of plumage may &s;till have place in the &s;ame &s;pecies,
for we &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to point out as great changes produced
in our own climates, and the variations ought to be &s;till greater in
di&s;tant regions. The Shrike from Loui&s;iana re|&s;embles that of Italy; and
the temperature of the&s;e countries are nearly alike. The others, from the
Cape, Senegal, and Madaga&s;car, bear le&s;s ana|logy; and the climates to
which they belong are al&s;o more different.&mdash;The Shrike from Cay|yenne is
variegated with long brown bars (Pl. Enl. N^o 297); but the &s;ize and other
properties being the &s;ame, we have ranged it likewi&s;e with the common kind.

<P>THIS bird is rather &s;maller than the preced|ing, and may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the tinge of its head, which is &s;ometimes red, and commonly bright ferruginous; its eyes al&s;o are whiti&s;h or yellowi&s;h, while in the Great Ci|nereous Shrike they are brown, and its bill and legs are blacker. Its in&s;tincts, however, are near|ly the &s;ame; both of them are bold and mi&s;|chievous, yet they are evidently of different &s;pe|cies; for the Great Cinereous Shrike is a per|manent &s;ettler, while the Woodchat quits the country in autumn, and returns not till &s;pring. The family, which does not di&s;per&s;e after the young are fledged, departs alone in the begin|ning of September; they flutter from tree to tree, and &s;upport not a continued flight even in their migrations. They re&s;ide during &s;ummer in the plains, and ne&s;tle on the bu&s;hy trees; in

<P>THE Red-backed Shrike is only a little &s;maller than the Woodchat; and its habits are &s;imilar. It departs with its family in Sep|tember, and returns in the &s;pring. It breeds in the trees or bu&s;hes in the open country, and not in the woods. It feeds its young commonly with in&s;ects, and preys upon the &s;mall birds. In &s;hort, the only material difference con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ize, and in the di&s;tribution and &s;hades of the colours, which &s;eem to be invariably di&s;cri|minated in both &s;pecies: but the difference is &s;till greater between the male and female in each &s;pecies. We may therefore with propriety regard the Woodchat, the Red-backed Shrike, and the variegated Red-backed Shrike, as varie|ties of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Some naturali&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collurionis parvi &s;ecundum genus.</HI> ALDROV, <HI>Collurio varius.</HI> BRISS.</NOTE> have indeed reckoned the la&s;t a di&s;tinct &s;pecies; but the compari&s;on of the figures &s;eems to prove that it is only the female of the Red-backed Shrike.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="288">
The&s;e two &s;pecies of Shrikes, with their va|rieties, breed in Sweden as well as in France. We may pre&s;ume therefore that they will be found in the new continent; and we may rec|kon the foreign kinds as only varieties of the Woodchat produced by the influence of climate.</P>
<P>Nothing can &s;hew better that birds migrate into warmer countries to pa&s;s the winter, than the Woodchat (N^o 477, Fig. 2, Pl. Enl.) &s;ent by Adan&s;on from Senegal, and which is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with the European Woodchat. There is another (N^o 279, Pl.

<P>EDWARDS &s;peaks of this bird in the following terms:&mdash;The &s;hape of its bill, the whi&s;kers at its ba&s;e, and the &s;trength of its legs, have in|duced me to range it with the Shrikes; though its tail is different, being forked, while that of the Shrike has the longe&s;t feathers in the mid|dle. Its bill is &s;trong, thick, and arched, nearly like that of a Sparrow-hawk, but longer in pro|portion to its thickne&s;s, le&s;s hooked, and with wide no&s;trils. The ba&s;e of the upper mandible is be&s;et with &s;tiff hairs. . . . The whole of the head, neck, back, and the coverts of the wings, are of a &s;hining black, with reflections of blue, purple, and green, varying according to its po|&s;ition. . . . The brea&s;t is of an a&s;h-colour, du&s;ky,

and blacki&s;h. All the belly, the legs, and the coverts of the under &s;ide of the tail, are white; the legs, the feet, and the nails, are blacki&s;h brown.&mdash;I am at a lo&s;s, &s;ubjoins Edwards, whe|ther I &s;hould cla&s;s this bird with the Shrikes or the magpies; for it appears to be equally re|lated to each of them; and I am even inclined to think that both con&s;titute only one &s;pecies.&mdash;This conformity &s;eems to have been ob&s;erved in France, where the name <HI>pie</HI> is applied equally to the Shrikes and magpies.</P>

<HEAD>The NOCTURNAL BIRDS of PREY.</HEAD>
<P>THE eyes of the&s;e birds are &s;o delicate, that they &s;eem to be dazzled by the &s;plendor of day, and entirely overpowered by the lu&s;tre of the &s;olar rays; they require a gentler light, &s;uch as prevails at the dawn, or in the evening &s;hades. They leave their retreats to hunt, or rather to &s;earch for their prey, and their ex|peditions are performed with great advantage; for in this &s;till &s;ea&s;on, the other birds and &s;mall animals feel the &s;oft influence of &s;leep, or are about to yield to its &s;oothing power. Tho&s;e nights that are cheered by the pre&s;ence of the moon, are to them the fine&s;t of days, days of plea&s;ure and of abundance, in which they &s;eek their prey for &s;everal hours together, and procure an ample &s;upply of provi&s;ions. When &s;he with|holds her &s;ilver beams, their nights are not for|tunate; and their ravages are confined to a &s;ingle hour in the morning and in the evening; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e birds, though they can di&s;tingui&s;h objects nicely in a weak light, are able to perform their motions when involved in total darkne&s;s. Their &s;ight fails when the
<PB N="258" REF="300">
gloom of night is completely &s;ettled; and in this re&s;pect they differ not from other animals, &s;uch as hares, wolves, and &s;tags, which leave the woods in the evening to feed or to hunt during the night: only, the&s;e animals &s;ee &s;till better in the day than in the night; whereas the organs of vi&s;ion in the nocturnal birds are &s;o much overpowered by the brightne&s;s of the day, that they are obliged to remain in the &s;ame &s;pot with|out &s;tirring; and when they are forced to leave their retreat, their flight is tardy and interrupted, being afraid of &s;triking again&s;t the intervening ob&s;tacles. The other birds, perceiving their fear, or their con&s;trained &s;ituation, delight to in&s;ult them: the tit-mou&s;e, the finch, the red-brea&s;t, the black-bird, the jay, the thru&s;h, &amp;c. a&s;&s;emble to enjoy the &s;port. The bird of night remains perched upon a branch, motionle&s;s and con|founded, hears their movements and their cries, which are ince&s;&s;antly repeated, becau&s;e it an&s;wers them only with in&s;ignificant ge&s;tures, turning round its head, its eyes, and its body with a fooli&s;h air. It even &s;uffers it&s;elf to be a&s;&s;aulted without making re&s;i&s;tance; the &s;malle&s;t, the weake&s;t of its enemies are the mo&s;t eager to torment it the mo&s;t, determined to turn it into ridicule. Upon this play of mockery, or of natural antipathy, is founded the pretty art of bird-calling. We have only to put an Owl, or even to imitate its notes, in the place where the limed twigs are &s;pread, in order to draw the other
<PB N="259" REF="301">
birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ort of &s;port was known to the antients; for Ari&s;totle di&s;tinctly mentions it in the following terms: <Q REND="inline">In the day all the other &s;mall birds flock round the Owl, to admire it, as it is called, and &s;trike it. Whence, if it is &s;et in a proper place, many &s;ort of &s;mall birds may be caught.</Q></NOTE>. The be&s;t time is about an hour before the clo&s;e of the day;
for if this diver&s;ion be deferred later, the &s;ame &s;mall birds which
a&s;|&s;emble in the day to in&s;ult over the bird of night with &s;o much
audacity and ob&s;tinacy, avoid the rencounter after the evening &s;hades have
re&s;tored his vigour, and encouraged his exertions.</P>
<P>All this mu&s;t be under&s;tood with certain re&s;trictions, which it will be proper to &s;tate here: 1. All the &s;pecies of Owls are not alike dazzled with the light; the Great-eared Owl &s;ees &s;o di&s;tinctly in open day, as to be able to fly to con&s;iderable di&s;tances; the Little Owl chaces and catches its prey long before the &s;etting, and after the ri&s;ing of the &s;un. Travellers inform us, that the Great-earned Owl or Eagle-Owl of North America catches the white grous in open day, and even when the reflection of the &s;now adds to the inten&s;ity of the light: Belon remarks, <Q REND="inline">that whoever will examine the &s;ight of the&s;e birds, will find it not &s;o weak as is commonly ima|gined.</Q> 2. It appears that the Long-eared Owl &s;ees wor&s;e than the Scops, and is the mo&s;t dazzled by the light of day, as are al&s;o the Tawny Owl, the White, and the Aluco; for the&s;e equally attract the &s;ame birds, and afford
<PB N="260" REF="302">
them &s;port. But before we relate the facts which apply to each particular &s;pecies, we mu&s;t men|tion the general di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>The Nocturnal Birds of Prey may be divided into two principal <HI>genera:</HI> the genus of the <HI>Hibou,</HI> (the Long-eared or Horned Owl,) and that of the <HI>Chouette,</HI> (the Earle&s;s or Little Owl,) each of which contains &s;everal different &s;pecies. The di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the&s;e two <HI>ge|nera</HI> is, that all the <HI>Hibous</HI> have two tufts of feathers in the &s;hape of ears erect on each &s;ide of the head; while, in the <HI>Chouettes,</HI> the head is round without tufts or prominent feathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny &s;eems to have remarked this di&s;tinction: <Q REND="inline">Of the fea|thered race, the <HI>Bubo</HI> and the <HI>Otus</HI> alone have feathers like ears.</Q> <BIBL>Lib. xi. 37.</BIBL> And again, <Q REND="inline">The <HI>Otis</HI> is &s;maller than the <HI>Bubo,</HI> larger than the <HI>Noctuae,</HI> and has feathers projecting from the ears, whence its name; &s;ome call it in Latin <HI>A&s;io.</HI></Q> <BIBL>Lib. x. 23.</BIBL> N. B. There are three &s;pecies with tufted ears: the Great-eared Owl <HI>(Bubo)</HI>; the Long-eared Owl <HI>(Otus)</HI>; and the Scops-eared Owl <HI>(A&s;io),</HI> which Pliny confounds with the <HI>Otus.</HI></NOTE>. We &s;hall reduce the &s;pecies contained in the genus of the
<HI>Hibou</HI> to three. The&s;e are, 1. The Great-eared Owl. 2. The
Long-eared. 3. The Scops. But the genus of <HI>Chouette</HI> in|cludes at
lea&s;t five &s;pecies: which are, 1. The Aluco. 2. The Tawny. 3. The White. 4.
The Brown. And 5. The Little Owl. The&s;e eight &s;pecies are all found in
Europe, and even in France; &s;ome are &s;ubject to varieties, which &s;eem to
depend on the difference of climates; others occur that re&s;emble them in the
New <PB N="261" REF="303"> World; and indeed, mo&s;t of the Owls of Ame|rica
differ &s;o little from tho&s;e of Europe, that we may refer them to the &s;ame
origin.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle mentions twelve &s;pecies of birds which &s;ee in the dark, and fly during the night; and as in the&s;e he includes the O&s;prey and Goat-&s;ucker, under the names of <HI>Phinis</HI> and <HI>Aegotilas</HI>; and three others, under the names of <HI>Capriceps, Chalcis,</HI> and <HI>Charadrios,</HI> which feed on fi&s;h, and inhabit mar&s;hes, or the margins of lakes and &s;treams, it appears that he has reduced all the Owls known in Greece in his time to &s;even &s;pecies: the Long eared, which he calls <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>otus,</HI> precedes and conducts the quails when they begin their migration, and for this rea&s;on it is named <HI>dux,</HI> or <HI>leader</HI>; the etymology &s;eems certain, but the fact mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pected. It is true that the quails, when they leave us in the autumn, are exce&s;&s;ively fat, and &s;carcely fly but in the night, and repo&s;e during the day in the &s;hade to avoid the heat; and hence the Long|eared Owl may &s;ometimes be ob&s;erved to ac|company or go before the&s;e flocks of quails; but it has never been ob&s;erved that the Long-eared Owl is, like the quail, a bird of pa&s;&s;age. The only fact which I have found in travellers that &s;eems to countenance this opinion, is in the Preface to Cate&s;by's Natural Hi&s;tory of Carolina. He &s;ays, that in the twenty-&s;ixth degree of north latitude, being nearly in the middle of the Atlantic, in his pa&s;&s;age to Carolina, he &s;aw an Owl over the
<PB N="262" REF="304">
ve&s;&s;el; and he was more &s;urpri&s;ed at this cir|cum&s;tance, as that bird has &s;hort wings, and is ea&s;ily fatigued. He adds, that after making &s;everal attempts to alight, it di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>It may be alleged in &s;upport of this fact, that the Owls have not all &s;hort wings, &s;ince in mo&s;t of the&s;e birds they &s;tretch beyond the point of the tail, and the Great-eared Owl and the Scops are the only &s;pecies who&s;e wings do not reach quite its length. Be&s;ides, we learn from their &s;creams, that all the&s;e birds perform long journies; whence it &s;eems that the power of flying to a di&s;tance during the night, belongs to them as well as to the others; but their &s;ight be|ing le&s;s perfect, and not being able to de&s;cry re|mote objects, they cannot form an idea of a great extent of country, and therefore have not, like mo&s;t other birds, the in&s;tinct of migration. At lea&s;t, it appears that our Owls are &s;tationary. I have received all the &s;pecies not only in &s;um|mer, in &s;pring, in autumn, but even in the mo&s;t piercing colds of winter. The Scops alone di&s;appears in this &s;ea&s;on; and I have actually been informed, that this &s;mall &s;pecies departs in the autumn, and arrives in the &s;pring: hence we ought to a&s;cribe to the Scops, rather than the Long eared Owl, the bu&s;ine&s;s of leading the quails. But this fact is not proved, and I know not the foundation of another fact advanced by Ari&s;totle, who &s;ays, that the Tawny Owl (<HI>Glaux Noctua,</HI> according to his tran&s;lator Gaza) con|ceals
<PB N="263" REF="305">
it&s;elf for &s;everal days together; for in the chille&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year I have received &s;ome that were caught in the woods: and if it be pretended that the words <HI>Glaux Noctua</HI> &s;ignifies the White Owl, the fact would be &s;till wider off the truth; for except in very dark and rainy evenings, it is con&s;tantly heard through the whole year to whi&s;tle and &s;cream about twilight.</P>

But at the &s;ame time it will be a&s;ked, why I tran&s;lated <HI>Glaux,</HI> by the Tawny Owl; <HI>Nycticorax,</HI> by <HI>Aluco</HI>; and the <HI>Aegolios,</HI> by the Brown Owl; while all the no|menclators and naturali&s;ts who have preceded me have rendered <HI>Aegolios</HI> by <HI>Hulotte (Aluco),</HI> and are obliged to confe&s;s that they know not to what bird to refer the <HI>Nycticorax,</HI> nor the <HI>Cha|radrios,</HI> the Chalcis, and the <HI>Capriceps.</HI> I &s;hall be blamed for transferring the name of <HI>Glaux</HI> to the Tawny Owl, &s;ince it has been applied, by the uni|form con&s;ent of all who have gone before me, to the Brown Owl, or even to the Little Owl.</P>
<P>I proceed to explain the rea&s;ons which have induced me to make the&s;e innovations, and to remove the ob&s;curity which attends their doubts and their fal&s;e interpretations. Among the Nocturnal birds, which we have enumerated, the Tawny Owl is the only one who&s;e eyes are bluei&s;h, the Aluco the only one who&s;e eyes are blacki&s;h; in all the re&s;t the iris is of a golden, or at lea&s;t of a &s;affron colour. But the Greeks, who&s;e accuracy and preci&s;ion of ideas I have often admired in the names which they have applied to the objects in nature, which always mark the characters in a &s;triking manner, would have had no foundation to be&s;tow the name of <HI>Glaux (glaucous, coerulean)</HI> upon birds which have
<PB N="265" REF="307">
none of the blue &s;hade, and who&s;e eyes are black, orange, or yellow; but they would have had the be&s;t rea&s;on to give this name to that &s;ingle &s;pecies which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t by the blue tinge of its eyes; nor would they have called tho&s;e birds who&s;e eyes are yellow or blue, and who&s;e plumage is white or grey, and bear no re&s;emblance to the Raven, by the term <HI>Nycticorax,</HI> or Raven of night; but they would with great propriety have be&s;towed this name on that Owl, which is the only one of the Nocturnal Birds who&s;e eyes are black, and who&s;e plumage is almo&s;t black, and which in its &s;ize bears a greater analogy than any other to the Raven.</P>
<P>The probability of this interpretation derives additional force from another con&s;ideration. The <HI>Nycticorax</HI> was a common and noted bird among the Greeks, and even among the Hebrews, &s;ince it is often the &s;ubject of their compari&s;ons <HI>(&s;icut nycticorax in domicilio).</HI> We cannot imagine with tho&s;e literati, that this bird was &s;o &s;olitary and &s;o rare, that it can be no longer found. The Aluco is common in every country, it is the large&s;t of the Earle&s;s Owls; the blacke&s;t and the like&s;t the Raven: it differs widely from every other &s;pecies; and this ob&s;ervation drawn from the fact it&s;elf, ought to have more weight than the authority of tho&s;e nomenclators, who are too little acquainted with nature to interpret with accuracy its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="308">
But admitting that the <HI>Glaux</HI> &s;ignifies Tawny Owl, the Earle&s;s Owl with blue eyes, and <HI>Nycticorax,</HI> Aluco, or Earle&s;s Owl with white eyes, the <HI>Aegolios</HI> mu&s;t be the Earle&s;s Owl with yellow eyes.&mdash;This requires &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Theodore Gaza renders the word <HI>Nycticorax,</HI> fir&s;t by <HI>Cicuma,</HI> then by <HI>Ulula,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Cicunia:</HI> this la&s;t is probably the mi&s;take of the tran&s;cribers, who have written <HI>Cicunia</HI> in|&s;tead of <HI>Cicuma</HI>; for Fe&s;tus, prior to Gaza, al&s;o tran&s;lated <HI>Nycticorax</HI> by <HI>Cicuma</HI>; and I&s;idorus by <HI>Cecuma</HI>; others by <HI>Cecua.</HI>&mdash;To the&s;e words we may even refer the etymology of <HI>Zueta</HI> in Italian, and <HI>Chouette</HI> in French. If Gaza had attended to the characters of the <HI>Nycticorax,</HI> he would have adhered to his fir&s;t interpretation, <HI>Ulula,</HI> and would not have made a double ap|plication of this term; for he would, in that ca&s;e, have tran&s;lated <HI>Aegolios</HI> by <HI>Cicuma.</HI> Upon the whole therefore we may conclude, that <HI>Glaux</HI> is the Tawny Owl, <HI>Nycticorax</HI> the Aluco Owl, and <HI>Aegolios</HI> the Brown Owl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charadrios,</HI> the <HI>Chalcis,</HI> and the <HI>Capriceps,</HI> &s;till remain to be con&s;idered: Gaza is contented with giving the Greek words a Latin termina|tion. But as the&s;e birds are different from tho&s;e of which we at pre&s;ent treat, and &s;eem to be the inhabitants of mar&s;hes and the margins of lakes; we &s;hall defer the con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject till we come to the hi&s;tory of the birds that fi&s;h in the twilight. The Little Owl is the only
<PB N="267" REF="309">
&s;pecies who&s;e name I cannot di&s;cover in the Greek language. Ari&s;totle never mentions it, and probably he confounded it with the Scops, which it indeed re&s;embles in its &s;ize, its &s;hape, and in the colour of its eyes; and the only e&s;|&s;ential difference con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;mall projecting feather which the Scops has on each &s;ide of its head.&mdash;But we &s;hall de&s;cribe the&s;e di&s;tinctions more minutely in the following articles.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus ju&s;tly remarks, that mo&s;t of the mi&s;takes in Natural Hi&s;tory ari&s;e from the con|fu&s;ion of names, and that the &s;ubject of Noc|turnal Birds is involved in the ob&s;curity and &s;hades of night. What we have now mentioned will, I hope, in a great mea&s;ure di&s;pel the cloud; and to throw greater light, we &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few remarks. The names <HI>Ule, Eule</HI> in German, <HI>Owl, Owlet</HI> in Engli&s;h, <HI>Huette, Hulote</HI> in French, are derived from the Latin <HI>Ulula,</HI> which imi|tates by its &s;ound the cry of the large kind of Nocturnal Birds. It is probable, as Fri&s;ch remarks, that this appellation was fir&s;t appropri|ated to the Great Earle&s;s Owl, but was after|wards applied to the &s;mall ones, from their re|&s;emblance in form and in&s;tinct; and at la&s;t be|came a general term, comprehending the whole genus. Hence proceeds that confu&s;ion which is but imperfectly remedied by annexing epi|thets that allude to their haunts, their &s;hape, or their cry. For example <HI>Stein-eule</HI> in German, Stone-owl, is the <HI>Chouette,</HI> or the Brown Owl;
<PB N="268" REF="310">
<HI>Kirch-eule</HI> in German, Church Owl, is the French <HI>Effraie,</HI> White Owl, which is al&s;o named <HI>Schleyer-eule,</HI> Winged Owl, <HI>Perl-eule,</HI> Pearl Owl. <HI>Ohr-eule</HI> in German, Horn Owl, is the <HI>Hibou</HI> of the French (Long-eared). <HI>Knapp-eule,</HI> Nut|cracker Owl, is a name which might have been applied to all the large Owls, which make a noi&s;e like that action with their bills. <HI>Bubo</HI> in Latin, the <HI>Eagle Owl,</HI> is derived from <HI>Bos,</HI> from the re&s;emblance of its note to the lowing of an ox. The Germans have imitated the &s;ound, <HI>uhu.</HI></P>
<P>The three &s;pecies of Earle&s;s Owls, and the five &s;pecies of Eared Owls, which we have now di&s;tingui&s;hed, include the whole genus of the Nocturnal Birds of Prey. They differ from the birds that commit their ravages in the day. 1. By the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight, which is delicate, and unable to &s;upport the glare of light. The pupil contracts in the day-time, but in a manner differ|ent from that of cats; for it retains its form, and contracts equally in every direction, while that of cats becomes narrow and extended vertically. 2. By the &s;en&s;e of hearing, which appears to be &s;uperior to that of other birds, and perhaps to that of every other animal; for the drum of the ear is proportionally larger than in the qua|drupeds, and be&s;ides they can open and &s;hut this organ at plea&s;ure, a power po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by no other animal. 3. By the bill, who&s;e ba&s;e is not, as in tho&s;e birds which prey in the day, covered with a thin naked &s;kin, but is &s;haded with fea|thers
<PB N="269" REF="311">
projecting forward; it is al&s;o &s;hort, and both mandibles are moveable like tho&s;e of the parrokeets, which is the rea&s;on that they &s;o often crack their bill, and can receive very large mor&s;els, which their wide throat admits to be &s;wallowed. 4. By their claws, which have an anterior mov|able toe, that can be turned backwards at plea&s;ure, and enables them to re&s;t on a &s;ingle foot more firmly and ea&s;ily than others. 5. By their mode of flying, which when they leave their hole, is a kind of tumbling, and is con&s;tantly &s;ideways, and without noi&s;e, as if they were wafted by the wind.&mdash;Such are the general di&s;tinctions between the Nocturnal and Diurnal Birds of Prey: they have nothing &s;imilar but their arms, nothing common but their appetite for fle&s;h and their in&s;tinct for plunder.</P>

&s;ituated near mountains; it &s;eldom ventures into the plains; it declines
the boughs of trees, but commonly perches upon &s;olitary churches and ancient
ca&s;tles. Its prey con&s;i&s;ts in general of young hares, rabbits, moles, and
mice, which it &s;wallows entire, dige&s;ts the fle&s;hy parts, and afterwards
throws up the hair, bones, and &s;kin, rolled into a ball<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> <Q REND="inline">I have twice,</Q> &s;ays Fri&s;ch, <Q REND="inline">had Great-eared Owls, and have

bones with their bill, then &s;wallowed them one after another, &s;ometimes to
the number of five. After &s;ome hours, the hair and bones are collected in the
&s;tomach, and rejected through the bill. When they can get nothing el&s;e,

&s;o active in the breed|ing &s;ea&s;on, that its ne&s;t is quite crammed with
provi&s;ions: it collects more than other birds of prey.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are &s;ometimes kept on account of their &s;ingular figure. The &s;pecies is not &s;o nu|merous in France as tho&s;e of the other Owls; and it is not certain whether they remain the whole year in the country. They however ne&s;tle &s;ometimes in hollow trees, and oftener in
<PB N="273" REF="316">
the crags of rocks, or in the holes of lofty old walls. Their ne&s;t is near three feet in diameter, compo&s;ed of &s;mall branches of dry wood inter|woven with pliant roots, and &s;trewed with leaves. They commonly lay one or two eggs, and but &s;eldom three; the&s;e re&s;emble &s;omewhat the colour of the plumage of the bird, and are larger than hens eggs. The young are very vo|racious; and the parents are vigilant in provid|ing &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which they procure in &s;ilence, and with much more agility than we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e from their extreme corpulence. They often fight with the buzzards, are victorious in the combat, and &s;eize the plunder. They &s;up|port more ea&s;ily the light of day than the other nocturnal birds; for they leave their haunts earlier in the evening, and later in the morning. Sometimes the Great-eared Owl is &s;een attacked by flocks of crows, which accompany his flight and &s;urround him by thou&s;ands; he with&s;tands their on&s;et<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>, drowns their hoar&s;e murmurs with his louder &s;creams, di&s;per&s;es them, and often when the light begins to fail he &s;eizes &s;ome fated victim. Though his wings are &s;horter than tho&s;e of mo&s;t of the birds that &s;oar, he can ri&s;e to a great height, e&s;pecially about twilight; but at other times he generally flies low, and to &s;hort di&s;tances. The Great-eared Owl is employed in falconry to attract the notice of the Kite, and
<PB N="274" REF="317">
he is furni&s;hed with a fox-tail to heighten the &s;ingularity of his figure. Thus equipped, he &s;kims along the &s;urface of the ground, and alights on the plain, without venturing to perch upon a tree. The Kite perceives him from a di&s;tance, and advances not to fight or attack him, but to admire his odd appearance, and ge|nerally hovers about unguarded, till he is &s;ur|pri&s;ed by the &s;port&s;man, or caught by the birds of prey that are flown at him. Mo&s;t of the breeders of phea&s;ants al&s;o keep a Great-eared Owl, which they place in a cage among the ru&s;hes in an open place, to draw together the ravens and the crows, which gives them an opportunity of &s;hooting and killing a greater number of the&s;e noi&s;y birds, &s;o alarming to the young phea&s;ants. To avoid &s;caring the phea|&s;ants, they &s;hoot at the crows with a cro&s;s-bow.</P>
<P>With regard to the internal &s;tructure of this bird, it has been remarked, that the tongue is &s;hort and broad, the &s;tomach capacious, the eye inclo&s;ed in a cartilaginous coat in the form of a cap&s;ule, the brain inve&s;ted with a &s;ingle coat thicker than that of other birds; and, as in the quadrupeds, there are two membranes which cover the <HI>cerebellum.</HI></P>
<P>It appears that in this &s;pecies there is a fir&s;t variety which includes a &s;econd; both are found in Italy, and have been mentioned by Aldro|vandus. The one may be called the <HI>Black|winged</HI>

<P>I &s;hall ob&s;erve that there is only one character which &s;eems to imply that this bird is a permanent variety of the Great-earned Owl, viz. that the tufts do not ri&s;e from the ears, but from the ba&s;e of the bill; and as the &s;ame bird is al&s;o found in Europe, we may re|gard it as compo&s;ing a di&s;tinct family in this &s;pecies.</P></NOTE> is, that the tufts ri&s;e from the bill, <PB N="277" REF="320"> and
not from the ears. But in the figures of the three Eagle-Owls given by
Aldrovandus, the tufts ri&s;e from the ears in the fir&s;t only, or the Common;
and in the others, which are but varieties that occur in Italy, the tuft
feathers are not in&s;erted at the ears, but at the ba&s;e of the bill, as in
the Eagle-Owl of Virginia de&s;cribed by Edwards. Klein was therefore ra&s;h in
a&s;&s;ert|ing, that the Eagle-Owl of Virginia was a &s;pe|cies entirely
different from that of Europe. If he had con&s;ulted the figures of Aldrovandus
and Edwards, he would have found that this di&s;tinc|tion, which only
con&s;titutes a variety, occurs in <PB N="278" REF="321"> Italy as well as in
Virginia, and that in general the tufts of the&s;e birds do not proceed exactly

<P>THE ears of this bird are very wide, like tho&s;e of the Great-eared Owl, and covered with a tuft formed of &s;ix feathers pointing for|wards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus &s;ays, that he ob&s;erved that each of the feathers in this cre&s;t is &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;eparate motion, and that the &s;kin which covers the cavity of the ears ari&s;es from the part of the in|&s;ide next to the eye.</NOTE>; but the&s;e tufts are much &s;horter than tho&s;e of the Great Owl, and hardly exceed an inch in length; they are however proportioned to its &s;ize, for it weighs only about ten ounces, and is not larger than a crow. It is therefore a &s;pecies evidently different from that of the Great-eared Owl, which is about the bulk of a goo&s;e; and from that of the Scops, which is not larger than a blackbird, and in which the tufts above the ears are very &s;hort. I make this re|mark,
<PB N="280" REF="324">
becau&s;e &s;ome naturali&s;ts have con&s;idered the&s;e as merely varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The Long-eared Owl mea&s;ures about a foot from the point of the bill to the claws; its wings extend three feet, and its tail is five or &s;ix inches. The upper part of its head, neck, back, and wings, are marked with rays of gray, ru&s;ty, and brown; the brea&s;t and belly are ru&s;ty, with irregular and narrow brown bars; the bill is &s;hort and blacki&s;h; the eyes of a fine yellow; the feet covered with ru&s;ty-coloured feathers as far as the origin of the claws, which are pretty broad, and of a blacki&s;h brown. We may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the tongue is fle&s;hy, and &s;omewhat forked, the nails very &s;harp, the outer claw moveable, and may be turned backwards; the &s;tomach capacious, the gall-bladder very large, the guts about twenty inches long, the two <HI>caecas</HI> two inches and a half deep, and proportionally thicker than in the other birds of prey.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies is common, and much more nu|merous in our climate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is more common in France and Italy than in England.

The Long-eared Owl is &s;tationary during the whole year, and is even found more readily in winter than in &s;ummer. It commonly lodges in old ruined buildings, in the caverns of rocks, in the hollows of aged trees, in mountain-fore&s;ts, and

<P>It appears that this bird, which is common in our part of Europe, is found al&s;o in A&s;ia; for Belon mentions his having met with it in the plains of Cilicia.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies admits of &s;everal varieties, the fir&s;t of which occurs in Italy, and has been de|&s;cribed by Aldrovandus. It is larger than the common &s;ort, and differs in the colour of its plumage.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds &s;eldom take the trouble to con|&s;truct a ne&s;t; for all the eggs and young which I have received were found in the ne&s;ts of other birds; often in tho&s;e of magpies, which it is well known con&s;truct a new one every year; &s;ometimes in tho&s;e of buzzards; but I could never procure a ne&s;t built by them&s;elves.

it <HI>Motus Satyricos</HI> (i. e. <HI>Satiric Move|ments</HI>). But the Scops
of Pliny is the &s;ame with the <HI>Otus</HI> of Ari&s;totle; for the Latins

<P>What the ancients have related with re&s;pect to the&s;e awkward motions and ridiculous ge&s;tures, mu&s;t be principally applied to the Long-eared Owl; and, as &s;ome philo&s;ophers and naturali&s;ts have pretended that this was not an Owl, but quite a different bird, which they term the <HI>Lady of Numidia,</HI> I &s;hall here di&s;cu&s;s the que&s;tion, and remove the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The Anatomi&s;ts of the Academy of Sciences are tho&s;e to whom I allude; who, in their de|&s;cription of the Lady of Numidia <HI>(Demoi&s;elle de Numidie),</HI> have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h this opinion, and &s;tate their rea&s;ons in the following terms:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">The bird,</Q> &s;ay they, <Q REND="inline">which we de|&s;cribe, is called the <HI>Lady of Numidia</HI>; becau&s;e
<PB N="284" REF="328">
it is a native of that part of Africa, and &s;eems to imitate in &s;ome degree the light air and &s;kip of a lady who affects a graceful motion. It is more than two thou&s;and years &s;ince na|turali&s;ts have &s;poken of this bird, and remark|ed this peculiarity of in&s;tinct. Ari&s;totle gives it the name of <HI>Juggler, Dancer,</HI> and <HI>Buffoon,</HI> aping what it &s;ees.&mdash;It would &s;eem this danc|ing mimicking bird was rare among the an|cients, becau&s;e Pliny believes that it was fa|bulous, referring this animal, which he calls <HI>Satyricus,</HI> to the cla&s;s of Pega&s;u&s;es, Griffons, and Syrens. It has probably been till now un|known to the moderns, &s;ince they do not de|&s;cribe it from their own ob&s;ervation, but only from the writings of antiquity, in which it re|ceived the names of <HI>Scops</HI> and <HI>Otus</HI> from the Greeks, and <HI>A&s;io</HI> from the Latins, and which they had termed <HI>Dancer, Juggler,</HI> and <HI>Comedi|an</HI>; &s;o that it mu&s;t be inquired, whether our Lady of Numidia is really the <HI>Scops</HI> or <HI>Otus</HI> of the ancients. The de&s;cription which they have given us con&s;i&s;ts of three particulars:&mdash;1&s;t, It imitates ge&s;tures.&mdash;2d, It has tufts of fea|thers on both &s;ides of the head, like ears.&mdash;3d, The plumage is, according to Alexander the Myndian, in Athenaeus, of a leaden colour. But all the&s;e properties belong to the <HI>Lady of Numidia</HI>; and Ari&s;totle &s;eems to mark their manner of dancing, which is that of leaping the one before the other, when he &s;ays, that
<PB N="285" REF="329">
they are caught when they dance one oppo&s;ite to the other. Belon however believes, that the <HI>Otus</HI> of Ari&s;totle is the Owl, for this only rea&s;on, that that bird makes many ge&s;|tures with its head: mo&s;t of the tran&s;lators of Ari&s;totle, who are al&s;o of our opinion, found it upon the name <HI>Otus,</HI> which &s;ignifies having ears; but they are not peculiar to the Long-eared Owl; and Ari&s;totle evidently &s;ignifies that the <HI>Otus</HI> is not the Long-eared Owl, when he &s;ays, that the <HI>Otus</HI> re&s;embles it; and this re|&s;emblance is probably not in regard to the ears. All the <HI>Ladies of Numidia</HI> which we have diffected, had on the &s;ides of the ears the&s;e feathers, which have given occa&s;ion to the name <HI>Otus</HI> of the ancients. . . . Their plumage was of an a&s;h-colour, &s;uch as is de&s;cribed by Alexander the Myndian as be|longing to the <HI>Otus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let us compaare Ari&s;totle's de&s;cription of the <HI>Otus</HI> with that of the Academicians. <Q REND="inline">The <HI>Otus</HI> is like the Owl, being furni&s;hed with &s;mall projecting feathers about the ears, whence its name, <HI>Otus</HI> or Eared; &s;ome call it <HI>Ullula,</HI> others <HI>A&s;io</HI>; it is a babbler, a tumbler, and a mimic, for it imitates dancers. It is caught like the Owl, the one bird-catcher going round it, while it is intent upon the other.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Otus,</HI> that is, the Long-eared Owl, is like the <HI>Noctua</HI> or Tawny Owl; they re&s;emble in
<PB N="286" REF="330">
fact, in their &s;ize, their plumage and natural habits; both are nocturnal birds of contiguous &s;pecies; whereas the <HI>Lady of Numidia</HI> is &s;ix times thicker and larger, and is of a quite different &s;hape, and of a different genus, being by no means a nocturnal bird. The <HI>Otus</HI> differs from the <HI>Noctua</HI> only by the tufts on the head near the ears, and Ari&s;totle remarks this di&s;tinction. The&s;e are &s;mall feathers, &s;traight and tufted, not the long ones that fall back, and hang from each &s;ide of the head, as in the <HI>Lady of Numidia.</HI> We cannot therefore refer the word <HI>Otus</HI> to this bird, but evidently to this Long-eared Owl <HI>(Noctua Aurita)</HI>; and this inference is con|firmed by what Ari&s;totle immediately adds, <Q REND="inline">&s;ome call it <HI>Ulula,</HI> and others <HI>A&s;io.</HI></Q> Nothing therefore is more groundle&s;s, in my opinion, than the pretended re&s;emblance which they have en|deavoured to trace between the <HI>Otus</HI> of the an|cients and the <HI>Lady of Numidia,</HI> the whole of which is founded on &s;ome ludicrous ge&s;tures and motions which di&s;tingui&s;h this &s;prightly bird; but the Long-eared Owl is &s;till entitled to the epithets <HI>Screamer</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch, &s;peaking of this Owl, &s;ays, that its cry is very frequent and &s;trong; and he compares it to the hooting of children running to make game of one; but that this cry is common to &s;everal kinds of Owls.</NOTE>, <HI>Mimic, Buffoon.</HI> The other character which Ari&s;totle mentions, that this bird is ea&s;ily caught, as the other Owls, can only be applied to this bird of night. . . .

<P><PB N="296" REF="342">
The Tawny Owls are &s;carcely found any where but in the woods. In Burgundy they are more common than the Alucos; they lodge in hollow trees, and I have received &s;ome in the &s;evere&s;t winters; which fact &s;eems to prove that they are &s;tationary in the country, and &s;eldom approach the habitations of men.

<P>THE White Owl alarms the timid by its blowing notes, <HI>&s;he~, &s;he~i, &s;he~ie~</HI>; its &s;harp dole|ful cries, <HI>gr&ebreve;i, gr&ebreve;, cr&ebreve;i,</HI> and its broken accents which often di&s;turb the dread &s;ilence of night. It is in &s;ome degree dome&s;tic; it inhabits the mo&s;t populous towns, towers, belfries, the roofs of churches, and other lofty buildings, which afford it retreat during the day. It leaves its haunts about twilight, and continually repeats its blowing, which re&s;embles the &s;noring of a man which &s;leeps with his mouth open. When it flies or alights, it utters al&s;o different &s;harp notes, which are all &s;o di&s;agreeable, that, joined to the awfulne&s;s of the &s;cene, re-echoed from the tombs and the churches in the &s;tillne&s;s and
<PB N="298" REF="345">
darkne&s;s of night, in&s;pire dread and terror in the minds of women and children, and even of men who are under the influence of the &s;ame prejudices, and who believe in omens and witches, in gho&s;ts and apparitions. They re|gard the White Owl as a funereal bird, and the me&s;&s;enger of death; and they are impre&s;&s;ed with an idea, that if it perches upon a hou&s;e, and utters cries a little different from ordi|nary, it then &s;ummons the inhabitant to the tomb.</P>
<P>It is readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other Earle&s;s Owls, by the beauty of its plumage; it is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize with the Tawny Owl, &s;maller than the Aluco, and larger than the Brown Owl, of which we &s;hall treat in the fol|lowing article. Its extreme length is a foot, or thirteen inches; its tail mea&s;ures only five inches; the upper part of its body is yellow, waved with gray and brown, and &s;prinkled with white points; the under part white, marked with black &s;pots; the eyes regularly encircled with white feathers, &s;o &s;lender that they might be taken for hairs; the iris is of a fine yellow, the bill white, except the end of the hook, which is brown; the legs covered with white down, the claws white, and the nails blacki&s;h. There are others which, though of the &s;ame &s;pecies, &s;eem at fir&s;t to be very different; in &s;ome the brea&s;t and belly are of a fine yellow, &s;prinkled with the &s;ame black points; in others they are
<PB N="299" REF="346">
perfectly white; in others they are yellow, and without a &s;ingle &s;pot.</P>
<P>I have had &s;everal alive. They are ea&s;ily caught, by placing a &s;mall net at the holes where they lodge in old buildings. They live ten or twelve days in the cages where they are &s;hut, but they reject all &s;u&s;tenance, and die of hunger. They continue motionle&s;s during the day, but mount the top of the roo&s;t in the night, and whi&s;tle the note <HI>&s;he~, &s;he~i,</HI> by which they &s;eem to invite the others; and indeed I have often &s;een them attracted by the calls of the pri&s;oner, alight near the cage, make the &s;ame whi&s;tling noi&s;e, and allow them&s;elves to be caught in the net. I never heard them when confined utter the grat|ing cry <HI>(&s;tride) cr&ebreve;i~, gr&ebreve;i~</HI>; this &s;ound is given only in the flight, when they are in perfect freedom. The female is &s;ome what larger than the male, and the colours of its plumage are lighter and more di&s;tinct; and of all the nocturnal birds its plu|mage is the mo&s;t beautifully varied.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the White Owl is numerous, and very common in every part of Europe. It is al&s;o found through the whole extent of the continent of America. Marcgrave found it in Bra&s;il, where the inhabitants call it <HI>Tuidara.</HI></P>
<P>The White Owl does not, like the Aluco and the Tawny Owls, depo&s;it its eggs in the ne&s;ts of other birds. It drops them in the bare holes of walls, or in the joi&s;ts of hou&s;es, and al&s;o in the hollows of trees; nor does it &s;pread roots or
<PB N="300" REF="347">
leaves to receive them. It begins early in the &s;pring, in the end of March, or the beginning of April. It lays five egs, &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even, of a longi&s;h &s;hape, and whiti&s;h colour; it feeds its young with in&s;ects and fragments of mice. They are white at fir&s;t, and are not an unplea|&s;ant meal at the end of three weeks, for they are fat and plump. Their parents clear the churches of the mice; frequently drink or ra|ther eat the oil from the lamps, e&s;pecially when it has congealed; &s;wallow mice and &s;mall birds whole, vomiting afterwards the bones, feathers, and &s;kin. Their excrements are white and liquid like tho&s;e of the other birds of prey. In fine weather, mo&s;t of the&s;e birds vi&s;it the neigh|bouring woods in the night, but return to their u&s;ual haunts in the morning, and there &s;lumber and &s;nore till dark, when they &s;ally from their holes, and fly tumbling almo&s;t to the ground. In the &s;evere &s;ea&s;ons five or &s;ix are &s;ometimes di&s;covered in the &s;ame hole, or concealed in the fodder, where they find &s;helter, warmth, and food; for the mice are more plentiful then in the barns than at any other time. In autumn they often pay a nightly vi&s;it to the places where the &s;prings are laid for the wood-cocks and thru&s;hes; they kill the wood-cocks, which they find hang|ing, and eat them on the &s;pot; but they &s;ome|times carry off the thru&s;hes and other &s;mall birds that are caught, often &s;wallowing them en|tire with their feathers, but generally when
<PB N="301" REF="348">
they are larger, plucking them previou&s;ly.&mdash;The&s;e in&s;tincts, and that of flying &s;ideways with ru&s;tling wings, are common to the White, the Aluco, and the Tawny Owls. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The &s;pecific character of the <HI>White Owl, Strix Fiammea,</HI> LINN. is, that <Q REND="inline">its head is &s;mooth, its body yellowi&s;h, with white points; below it is whiti&s;h, with blacki&s;h points.</Q> It is com|mon in England.

<P>THIS &s;pecies is pretty common, but does not frequent our habitations &s;o much as the White Owl. It haunts quarries, rocks, ruins, and de&s;erted edifices; it even prefers moun|tainous tracts, craggy precipices, and &s;eque&s;tered &s;pots; but it never re&s;orts to the woods, or lodges in hollow trees. The colour of its eyes, which is a bright yellow, di&s;tingui&s;hes it from the Aluco and the Tawny Owls. The differ|ence is more &s;light between it and the White Owl; becau&s;e in both, the iris is yellow, &s;ur|rounded with a circle of &s;mall white feathers; the under-part of the belly is tinged with yel|low; and their &s;ize is nearly the &s;ame. But the Brown Owl is of a deeper colour, marked with larger &s;pots re&s;embling &s;mall flames; whereas
<PB REF="350">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>N^o 27. THE BROWN OWL.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="303" REF="351"> tho&s;e of the White Owl are only little
points or drops; hence the former has been termed <HI>Noctua Flammeata,</HI>
and the latter <HI>Noctua Guttata.</HI> The feet of the Brown Owl are clo&s;ely
covered with feathers, and the bill is brown; while the bill of the White Owl
is whiti&s;h, and brown only near the tips. In this &s;pecies al&s;o, the
plu|mage of the female is marked with &s;maller &s;pots than the male, and its
colours are more dilute. Belon con&s;iders the White Owl as allied to the
Little Owl; and indeed they bear a re&s;emblance in their figure and
in&s;tincts; and in German they both have the generic name <HI>Kautz
(Coot).</HI> Salerne informs us, that in the province of Or|leans the labourers
have a great e&s;teem for this bird, becau&s;e it de&s;troys the field-mice;
that in the month of April it utters day and night the &s;ound <HI>goo</HI> in
a &s;oft tone; but before rain it changes this note into <HI>goyong</HI>; that
it builds no ne&s;t, and lays only three eggs, which are en|tirely white,
perfectly round, and about the &s;ize of tho&s;e of a wood-pigeon. He adds,
that it lodges in hollow trees, and that Olina was gro&s;sly mi&s;taken when he
a&s;&s;erted that it hatches in the two la&s;t months of winter. The la&s;t
cir|cum&s;tance, however, is not far from the truth; for this bird, and tho&s;e
of the &s;ame kind, lay their eggs in March, and the incubation mu&s;t take
place about the &s;ame time. Nor is it caught in hollow trees, but, as we have
already &s;aid, it haunts the rocks and caverns. It is con|&s;iderably 
<PB N="304" REF="352"> &s;maller than the Aluco, and even than the Tawny Owl,

<P>It appears that this Brown Owl which is com|mon in Europe, e&s;pecially in the hilly countries, is al&s;o found in the mountains of Chili; and that the &s;pecies de&s;cribed by Father Feuill&eacute;e by the epithet of <HI>Rabbit,</HI> becau&s;e it was di&s;covered in a hole in the ground, is only a variety of the European kind, differing by the di&s;tribution of its colours.

de|ceived by the re&s;emblance of the &s;cream <HI>e~dm&ebreve;,</HI> call out,
<HI>Who's there below? my name is not Edme, it is Peter.</HI></NOTE>. It
&s;eldom haunts the woods; but its ordinary abode is among &s;olitary ruins,
caverns, and old de&s;erted buildings, and it never lodges in hol|low trees. In
all the&s;e re&s;pects it re&s;embles mo&s;t the Brown Owl. Nor is it entirely
a bird of night; but &s;ees much better in the day than the other nocturnal
birds, and even chaces the &s;wal|lows and other &s;mall birds, though with
very little &s;ucce&s;s. It is more fortunate in the &s;earch for mice, which
it &s;wallows, not entire, but tears them in pieces with its bill and claws;
and it even plucks the birds neatly before it eats them; and in this in&s;tinct
it differs from the other Owls. It lays five eggs, which are &s;potted with
white and yellow, and con&s;tructs its rude, and almo&s;t bare ne&s;t in the
holes of rocks, and old walls. Fri&s;ch ob&s;erves, that this bird loves
&s;olitude, and haunts churches, vaults, and cemeteries, the re&s;i|dence of
the dead; that it is &s;ometimes called <HI>Church-Owl,</HI>
<HI>Corp&s;e-Owl</HI>; and that as it has been remarked to flutter about
hou&s;es where there were per&s;ons dying, the &s;uper&s;titious people name it
<HI>the</HI> <PB N="308" REF="357"> <HI>bird of death,</HI> and imagine that it
portends ap|proaching di&s;&s;olution. Fri&s;ch does not reflect that the&s;e
gloomy images are connected only with the White Owl, and that the Little Owl is
much more rare; that it hovers not about churches, nor has the plaintive moan
or the piercing inti|midating cry of the other. At any rate, if the Little Owl
be reckoned <HI>the bird of death</HI> in Ger|many, it is the White Owl that is
held ominous in France. The Little Owl which Fri&s;ch has figured, and which
occurs in Germany, appears to be a variety of ours: its plumage is much darker,
and its iris black. There is al&s;o a va|riety in the king's cabinet, which was
&s;ent from St. Domingo, and which is not &s;o white on the throat, and who&s;e
brea&s;t and belly are regularly marked with brown tran&s;ver&s;e bars; while,
in our Little Owl, the brown &s;pots are &s;cattered confu&s;edly.</P>

Marcgrave is the only per&s;on who has de&s;cribed it, but he gives no figure of it; it is a kind of Owl, &s;ays he, of the &s;ize of a fieldfare; its head round; its bill &s;hort, yellow, and hooked, with two holes for the no&s;trils; the eyes beautiful, large, round, and yellow, with a black pupil; under the eyes, and on the &s;ide of the bill, are long brown hairs; the legs are &s;hort, and they, as well as the feet, are clothed com|pletely with yellow feathers; the toes commonly four in number, with nails that are &s;emilunar, black and &s;harp; the tail broad, the wings ter|minating at its origin; the body, the back, the wings, and the tail, are of a pale du&s;ky colour, marked on the head and neck with very &s;mall white &s;pots, and on the wings with larger &s;pots of the &s;ame colour; the tail is waved with white; the brea&s;t and belly of a whiti&s;h-grey, clouded with light brown. Marcgrave adds,
<PB N="311" REF="360">
that this bird is ea&s;ily tamed; that it can bend its head, and &s;tretch its neck &s;o much as to touch with the point of its bill the middle of its back; that it frolics with men like a monkey, and makes &s;everal antic motions; that it can erect the tufts on the &s;ides of its head &s;o as to repre|&s;ent &s;mall horns or ears; and that it feeds upon raw fle&s;h. This de&s;cription proves that it ap|proaches nearly to the European Scops; and I am almo&s;t inclined to believe that the &s;ame &s;pe|cies inhabits the Cape of Good Hope.

<P>The bird of Hud&s;on's Bay, called in that part of America <HI>Caparacoch</HI>; of which Edwards has given an excellent de&s;cription and figure, and which he has named, <HI>The Little Hawk-Owl,</HI> becau&s;e it participates of the nature of both the&s;e birds, and &s;eems to be an intermediate &s;hade. It is &s;carcely larger than the <HI>Sparrow-hawk,</HI> and the length of its wings and tail give it a &s;imilar appearance. The &s;hape of its head and feet however &s;hews, that it is more nearly allied to the genus of Owls; but it flies and catches its prey in broad day, like the other rapacious di|urnal birds. Its bill is like that of the Sparrow-hawk, but not cornered on the &s;ides; it is glo&s;&s;y and orange-coloured, covered almo&s;t entirely with hairs, or rather &s;mall ragged grey feathers, like mo&s;t of the Owls; the iris is orange, the eyes encircled with white, and &s;haded with a little brown, &s;peckled with &s;mall longi&s;h du&s;ky &s;pots, and on the out&s;ide of this white &s;pace is a black ring, which extends as far as the ears; beyond this black circle there is again &s;ome white; the crown of the head is deep brown, mottled with &s;mall white round &s;pots; the arch of the neck and its feathers, as far as the middle of the back, are of a dull brown, edged with white; the wings are brown, and elegantly &s;potted with white; the &s;capular feathers are barred tran&s;ver&s;e|ly with white and brown; the three feathers next
<PB N="313" REF="364">
the body are not &s;potted, but only bordered with white; the lower part of the back and the rump are of a deep brown, with tran&s;ver&s;e &s;tripes of lighter brown; the lower part of the throat, the brea&s;t, the belly, the &s;ides, the legs, the rump, and inferior coverts of the tail, and the &s;maller inferior coverts of the wings, are white, with brown tran&s;ver&s;e ribs, but the larger coverts of the wings are of an ob&s;cure a&s;h-colour, with white &s;pots on the two edges; the fir&s;t of the quill-feathers of the wing is entirely brown with|out the lea&s;t &s;pot or border of white, and is not in the lea&s;t like the re&s;t of the quill-feathers, as may be remarked al&s;o in the other owls; the feathers of the tail are twelve in number, of an a&s;h-colour below, and a dull brown above, with white narrow tran&s;ver&s;e bars; the legs and feet are covered with fine &s;oft feathers, white like tho&s;e of the belly, barred with &s;horter and nar|rower brown lines; the nails are hooked, &s;harp, and of a deep brown colour. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">This is <HI>Strix Funerea</HI> of Linnaeus and Muller, and the <HI>Strix Canaden&s;is</HI> of Bri&s;&s;on, and the <HI>Canada Owl</HI> of Latharn.

<HEAD>BIRDS WHICH HAVE NOT THE POWER OF FLYING.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the light birds which &s;oar in the re|gion of the clouds, we pa&s;s to tho&s;e that are borne down by their weight, and cannot ri&s;e from the &s;urface. Our tran&s;ition is &s;ud|den; but knowledge is acquired in the mode of compari&s;on, and the oppo&s;ition and contra&s;t will throw additional light on the hi&s;tory of the winged race. Indeed, without examining clo&s;ely the end of the chain, we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the intermediate links. When Nature is di&s;played in her whole extent, &s;he pre&s;ents a boundle&s;s field, where the various orders of being are con|nected by a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of contiguous and re&s;embling objects: but it is not a &s;imple uniform &s;eries, it ramifies at intervals in all di|rections; the branches from different parts bend, and run into each other, and the&s;e flexions and this tendency to unite, are mo&s;t remarkable near the extremes. We have &s;een in the cla&s;s of quadrupeds, that one end of the chain &s;tretches to the tribe of birds in the different kinds of bats, which like the&s;e have the power of flying. The other end of the chain, we have perceived, de&s;cends to the order of whales, in the &s;eal, the
<PB N="320" REF="371">
<HI>wallrus,</HI> and the <HI>manati:</HI> another branch was ob|&s;erved ri&s;ing from the middle, and connecting the monkey to man by the intermediate links of the baboon, the pigmy-ape, and the orang-utang. On the one &s;ide, a &s;hoot bending through the <HI>ant-eaters,</HI> the <HI>phatagins,</HI> and the <HI>pangolins,</HI> which re&s;emble in &s;hape the crocodiles, the <HI>inguana,</HI> and the lizzards, unites the reptiles to the quadru|peds; on the other, through the <HI>tatous,</HI> who&s;e body is completely &s;heathed in a bony covering, it approaches the cru&s;taceous animals. It will be the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the band which connects the numerous order of birds; if we place its origin in tho&s;e birds which &s;hoot nim|bly with light pinions through the mid-way air, it will gradually pa&s;s through various minute &s;hades, and at la&s;t terminate in tho&s;e which are oppre&s;&s;ed with their weight, and de&s;titute of the in&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary to impel their a&euml;rial cour&s;e. The lower extremity will be found to divide into two branches; the one containing terre&s;trial birds, as the O&s;trich, the Touyou, the Ca&s;&s;o|wary, and the Dodo, which cannot ri&s;e from the ground; the other including the Pinguins and other aquatic birds, which are denied the u&s;e, or rather the re&s;idence of earth and air, and which never leave the &s;urface of the water, their proper element. Such are the ends of the chain; and we ought to examine the&s;e with attention before we venture to &s;urvey the intermediate links, in which the proper|ties
<PB N="321" REF="372">
of the extremes are variou&s;ly blended. To place this metaphy&s;ical view in its proper light, and to elucidate the ideas by actual ex|amples, we ought, immediately after treating of quadrupeds, to begin the Natural Hi&s;tory of the Birds which are the neare&s;t related to the&s;e animals. The O&s;trich re&s;embling the camel in the &s;hape of its legs, and the porcupine in the pipes or prickles with which its wings are arm|ed, ought to be ranged next the quadrupeds. But philo&s;ophy mu&s;t often yield to popular opi|nions; the numerous herd of naturali&s;ts would exclaim again&s;t this cla&s;&s;ification, and would re|gard it as an ab&s;urd innovation, proceeding merely from the love of &s;ingularity and contra|tradiction. But be&s;ides the general re&s;emblance in &s;ize and outward appearance, which alone ought to place it at the head of the winged race, we &s;hall find that there are many other analogies to be found in the internal &s;tructure; and that being almo&s;t equally related to the birds and to the quadrupeds, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the intermediate &s;hade.</P>
<P>In each &s;eries or chain which connects the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem of animated nature, the branches which extend to the &s;ubordinate cla&s;&s;es are al|ways &s;hort, and form very &s;mall <HI>genera.</HI> The birds that are not fitted to fly, con&s;i&s;t only of &s;even or eight &s;pecies; the quadrupeds that are able to fly, amount but to five or &s;ix.

<P>THE O&s;trich was known in the remote&s;t ages, and mentioned in the mo&s;t ancient books.

<P>Salerne is of opinion that Herodotus &s;peaks of three kinds of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">: the <HI>aquatic,</HI> or <HI>marine,</HI> which is the fi&s;h called plaice; the <HI>aerial,</HI> which is the &s;parrow; and <HI>the terre&s;trial</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) which is the O&s;trich. I can di&s;cover only the la&s;t, and I &s;hould render the epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> differently, <HI>&s;ubterranean</HI>; not that I believe in the exi&s;tence of &s;uch O&s;triches; but Herodotus is there de&s;cribing the &s;ingular productions peculiar to a certain region of Africa. The common O&s;trich was unlikely to be &s;elected, &s;ince the Greeks knew it was common in Africa; and the fancy or credulity of the an|cient hi&s;torian might create or a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e ideal beings.</P> 
<P>Nor is it probable that &s;o rich, &s;o preci&s;e, and &s;o fini&s;hed a lan|guage as the Greek, would a&s;&s;ign the generic name of O&s;trich to a bird or a fi&s;h. If I were allowed to offer a conjecture, I &s;hould &s;ay that the <HI>Aerial Struthos</HI> was the Long-tailed O&s;trich, which in &s;e|veral parts of Africa is at pre&s;ent called <HI>The Flying O&s;trich</HI>; and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Aquatic Struthos</HI> was &s;ome heavy water-fowl who&s;e wings were unfit for flying.</P></NOTE>, the mo&s;t antient of profane hi&s;torians, and in the writings of
the fir&s;t philo&s;ophers who have treated of the hi&s;tory of Nature: how
indeed could an animal &s;o remarkably large, &s;o &s;trangely &s;haped, and
&s;o wonderfully prolific, and peculiarly fitted for the climate, as the
O&s;trich, remain unknown in Africa and part of A&s;ia, countries peopled from
the earlie&s;t ages, full of de&s;erts indeed, but where there is not a &s;pot
that has not been trodden by the foot of man?</P>
<P>The family of the O&s;trich, therefore, is of great antiquity; nor in the cour&s;e of ages has
<PB N="325" REF="377">
it varied or degenerated from its native purity. It has always remained on its paternal e&s;tate; and its lu&s;tre has been tran&s;mitted un&s;ullied by foreign intercour&s;e. In &s;hort, it is among the birds what the elephant is among the quadru|peds, a di&s;tinct race, widely &s;eparated from all the others by characters as &s;triking as they are invariable.</P>
<P>The O&s;trich is reckoned the large&s;t of the birds; but it is deprived of the prerogative of the winged tribe, the power of flying. The one which Valli&s;nieri examined weighed, though it was very lean, fifty-five pounds, after the en|trails were taken out; &s;o that, allowing twenty pounds for the&s;e, and the fat that was wanting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Its two &s;tomachs, after being properly cleaned, weighed only &s;ix pounds; the heart, with the auricles, and the trunks of the large ve&s;&s;els, was one pound &s;even ounces; the two pancrea&s;es one pound; the inte&s;tines, which are very long and thick, mu&s;t be of con&s;ider|able weight.</NOTE>, we may e&s;timate the weight of an O&s;trich when alive, and in tolerable habit, at &s;eventy-five or eighty pounds. With what amazing force, then, mu&s;t the wings, and the impelling mu&s;cles of the&s;e wings, have been endowed, to have been able to rai&s;e and &s;u&s;pend in the air &s;o huge a ma&s;s? The power of Nature appears to the &s;uperficial ob|&s;erver as infinite; but when we examine clo&s;ely the minute parts, we perceive that every thing is limited; and to di&s;criminate with accuracy the&s;e limits, which the wi&s;dom, and not the weakne&s;s, of Nature has pre&s;cribed, is the be&s;t method to
<PB N="326" REF="378">
&s;tudy her works and operations. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the weight of &s;eventy-five pounds exceeds all the exertions of animal force to &s;upport it in the medium of the atmo&s;phere. Other birds al&s;o which approach in &s;ize to the O&s;trich, &s;uch as the <HI>Thuiou,</HI> the Ca&s;&s;owary, and the Dodo, are held down to the &s;urface of the earth: but their weight is not the &s;ole ob&s;tacle; the &s;trength of the pectoral mu&s;cles, the expan&s;ion of the wings, their favourable in&s;ertion, the &s;tiffne&s;s of the quill-feathers, &amp;c. would here be conditions the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the re&s;i&s;tance to be overcome is greater: but the&s;e requi&s;ites are entirely want|ing; for, to confine my&s;elf to the O&s;trich, this bird has, properly &s;peaking, no wings; &s;ince the feathers in&s;erted in the &s;houlders, in&s;tead of forming a compact body fit to make a powerful impre&s;&s;ion upon the air, are divided into loo&s;e &s;ilky filaments, and the feathers of the tail are of the &s;ame downy texture; nor can they ad|mit the varying po&s;itions which are nece&s;&s;ary for regulating their cour&s;e. It is remarkable that in the O&s;trich the feathers are all of the &s;ame texture; whereas in mo&s;t other birds, the plumage is compo&s;ed of different kinds of fea|thers. Tho&s;e next the &s;kin are &s;oft and woolly; the coverts are clo&s;er and more &s;olid; and the quill-feathers, which are de&s;tined to perform the motions, are long and &s;tiff. The O&s;trich is, therefore, confined to the ground by a double chain; by its great weight; and the &s;tructure of
<PB N="327" REF="379">
its wings, it is condemned, like the quadrupeds, to traver&s;e with labour the &s;urface, and exiled from the region of the air; and in both exter|nal and internal &s;tructure it bears great re&s;em|blance to the&s;e animals; like them, the greate&s;t part of its body is covered with hair rather than feathers; its head and &s;ides are almo&s;t naked; and its legs, in which its &s;trength chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts, are thick and mu&s;cular; its feet are &s;trong and fle&s;hy, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the camel, which differs from the other quadrupeds in that re|&s;pect; its wings, furni&s;hed with two pikes like tho&s;e of the porcupine, are to be regarded rather as a kind of arms de&s;tined for its defence; the ori|fice of the ear is uncovered, and only lined with hair in the in&s;ide at the auditory canal; its up|per eye-lid is moveable, as in almo&s;t all the qua|drupeds, and is edged with long eye-la&s;hes as in man, and in the elephant; the general &s;tructure of the eyes is mo&s;t analogous to what obtains in man, and they are &s;o placed that both of them point to the &s;ame object. The parts near the bottom of the <HI>&s;ternum,</HI> and near the <HI>os pubis,</HI> which, as in the camel, are callous, and de&s;titute of hair or feathers, indicate its weight, and re|duce it to a level with the humble&s;t of the bea&s;ts of burden. Thevenot was &s;o &s;truck with the analogy between the O&s;trich and the Drome|dary, that he fancied he could perceive the hump on its back; but, though the back is in|deed arched, there is nothing &s;imilar to the fle&s;hy
<PB N="328" REF="380">
protuberance that occurs in camels and drome|daries.</P>
<P>If we proceed, from the &s;urvey of its external form, to examine its internal &s;tructure, we &s;hall di&s;cover other properties which di&s;tingui&s;h it from the birds, and new analogies which link it with the quadrupeds.</P>

The fir&s;t ventricle is &s;ituated below the &s;econd; &s;o that what is generally termed the <HI>&s;uperior ori|&s;ice,</HI> in regard to its place, is in this ca&s;e really the inferior. The &s;econd ventricle is often di|vided from the fir&s;t by a &s;light con&s;tricture; and &s;ometimes it is be&s;ides formed into two cavities
<PB N="330" REF="382">
by a &s;imilar con&s;tricture; but this divi&s;ion can never be perceived externally. It is covered with glands, and inve&s;ted with a villous coat &s;omething like flannel, but with little adhe&s;ion, and perforated with an infinite number of &s;mall holes, corre&s;ponding to the orifices of the glands. It is not &s;o &s;trong as the gizzards of birds gene|rally are; but it is &s;trengthened externally by very powerful mu&s;cles, &s;ome of them three inches thick. Its outward form re&s;embles much that of the human ventricle.</P>
<P>Du Verney pretends that the hepatic duct ter|minates in this &s;econd ventricle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. de l'Academie des Sciences,</HI> 1694.</BIBL></NOTE>, as happens in the tench, and many other fi&s;hes, and &s;ometimes even in man, according to the ob&s;ervation of Galen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Valli&s;nieri.</NOTE>. But Ranby<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act. N^o 386.</BIBL></NOTE> and Valli&s;nieri affirm, that in &s;everal O&s;triches which they examined, they always found the in&s;ertion of this duct in the <HI>duodenum</HI> two inches, one inch, and &s;ome|times only half an inch below the <HI>pylorus.</HI> Val|li&s;nieri al&s;o points out the origin of this mi&s;take, if it be &s;uch, adding that in two O&s;triches he traced a ve&s;&s;el from the &s;econd ventricle to the liver, which he fir&s;t took for a branch of the hepatic duct, but afterwards di&s;covered that it was an artery which conveyed blood to the liver, and not bile to the ventricle.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="383">
The <HI>pylorus</HI> varies in regard to its width in different &s;ubjects; it is generally tinged with yellow, and, as well as the cavity of the &s;econd ventricle, is imbued with a bitter liquor. This is ea&s;ily accounted for, becau&s;e the hepatic duct takes its origin in the <HI>duodenum,</HI> and runs up|wards.</P>
<P>The <HI>pylorus</HI> di&s;charges it&s;elf into the <HI>duode|num,</HI> the narrowe&s;t of all the inte&s;tines, and in which are al&s;o in&s;erted the two pancreatic ducts, a foot, and &s;ometimes two or three feet, below the junction of the hepatic; while in other birds the in&s;ertion is made clo&s;e to the gall duct.</P>
<P>The <HI>duodenum</HI> and the <HI>jejunum</HI> are without valves; the <HI>ileon</HI> is furni&s;hed with &s;ome, as it runs into the <HI>colon.</HI> The&s;e three &s;mall inte&s;|tines are nearly half the length of the whole ali|mentary canal, which, in different &s;ubjects even of the &s;ame bulk, is &s;ubject to variation, being &s;ixty feet in &s;ome, and only twenty-nine in others.</P>
<P>The two <HI>caeca</HI> ri&s;e from the beginning of the <HI>colon,</HI> according to the anatomi&s;ts of the Aca|demy; or from the end of the <HI>ileum,</HI> according to Ranby. Each <HI>caecum</HI> forms a kind of hol|low cone two or three feet long, an inch wide at the ba&s;e, and furni&s;hed in the in&s;ide with a valve in the form of a &s;piral plate, making near twenty revolutions from the bottom to the top, as in the hare, the rabbit, the &s;ea-fox, the ray, the cramp|fi&s;h, and the thornback, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="384">
The <HI>colon</HI> al&s;o is furni&s;hed with leaf-&s;haped valves, but which, in&s;tead of turning &s;pirally, form a cre&s;cent that occupies rather more than half the circumference of the <HI>colon:</HI> &s;o that the ends of the oppo&s;ite cre&s;cents &s;lightly overlap each other. And this &s;tructure al&s;o occurs in the <HI>colon</HI> of the monkey, and in the <HI>jejunum</HI> of man, and marks the inte&s;tine exteriorly with tranver&s;e parallel furrows, about half an inch di&s;tant, and corre&s;ponding to the interior valves: but it is remarkable that the&s;e cre&s;cents do not occur through the whole length of the <HI>colon,</HI> or rather that the O&s;trich has two very different <HI>colons</HI>; the one broad and about a foot long, furni&s;hed with leafy valves; the other, narrower, and totally de&s;titute of valves, but extending to the <HI>rectum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>rectum</HI> is very wide, about a foot long, and near its termination covered with fle&s;hy &s;ibres. It opens into a large bag or bladder con|&s;i&s;ting of membranes, the &s;ame as the inte&s;tines, but thicker, and &s;ometimes containing even eight ounces of urine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The urine of the O&s;trich di&s;charges ink-&s;pots according to Hir|mola&uuml;s. The a&s;&s;ertion may be fal&s;e, but Ge&s;ner was mi&s;taken in con|tradicting it, on the ground that no bird has urine. If this were admitted, of what u&s;e are the kidneys, and the ureters? The only difference in this re&s;pect between birds and quadrupeds is, that in the former the baldder opens into the <HI>rectum.</HI></NOTE>. For the ureters make their di&s;charge by a very oblique in&s;ertion, as in the bladder of land animals; and not only convey
<PB N="333" REF="385">
urine, but al&s;o the white glutinous matter that accompanies or envelopes the excrement in all birds.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t bag, which wants only the neck to be a real bladder, communicates by an orifice furni&s;hed with a kind of <HI>&s;phincter</HI> with the &s;econd and la&s;t bag, which is &s;maller, and &s;erves for the pa&s;&s;age of the urine and the &s;olid excrements; it is almo&s;t &s;hut by a cartilaginous nut, adher|ing at its ba&s;e to the junction of the <HI>os pubis,</HI> and cleft in the middle like that of the apri|cot.</P>
<P>The &s;olid excrements are very like tho&s;e of &s;heep and goats, being divided into little balls, who&s;e bulk bears no relation to the capacity of the inte&s;tines where they are formed. In the &s;mall inte&s;tines, the appearance is like that of &s;oup, &s;ometimes green, &s;ometimes black, according to the quantity of aliment, which acquires con&s;i&s;tence as it approaches the thick inte&s;tines, but does not receive its &s;hape until it enters the &s;econd <HI>colon.</HI></P>
<P>Near the <HI>anus</HI> are &s;ometimes found &s;mall &s;acs, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to what occur in the &s;ame parts in lions and tigers.</P>
<P>The me&s;entery is tran&s;parent through its whole extent, and in &s;ome parts it is a foot broad. Valli&s;nieri pretends to have di&s;covered in it mani|fe&s;t traces of lymphatic ve&s;&s;els: Ranby al&s;o &s;ays, that the ve&s;&s;els of the me&s;entery are very di&s;tinct, but adds, that its glands can hardly be perceived.
<PB N="334" REF="386">
To mo&s;t ob&s;ervers indeed they have been alto|gether invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The liver is divided into two great lobes, as in man, but it is placed nearer the middle of the hypochondriac region, and has no gall blad|der. The &s;pleen is contiguous to the fir&s;t &s;to|mach, and weighs at lea&s;t two ounces.</P>
<P>The kidneys are very large, &s;eldom parted into &s;everal lobes as in other birds, but oftener &s;haped like a guitar, with a broad belly.</P>
<P>The ureters never creep along the kidneys as in mo&s;t other birds, but penetrate into their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The <HI>epiploon</HI> is very &s;mall, and only covers a part of the ventricle; but in its &s;tead we find over all the belly, and &s;ometimes on the inte&s;tines, a coat of fat or tallow &s;pread between the <HI>aponeu|ro&s;es</HI> of the mu&s;cles of the abdomen, and from two to &s;ix inches thick. It was this fat mixed with blood that formed the <HI>manteca,</HI> which was highly e&s;teemed, and extremely dear among the Romans, who, according to Pliny, reckoned it more efficacious than goo&s;e fat, for rheumati&s;m, cold &s;wellings, and pal&s;y; and even at pre&s;ent the Arabians pre&s;cribe it in the&s;e di&s;orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>The World Di&s;played,</HI> vol. xiii.</BIBL></NOTE>. Val|li&s;nieri is the only one who, probably from his happening to di&s;&s;ect very lean O&s;triches, &s;u&s;pects the exi&s;tence of this fact; and the more &s;o, that in Italy the leanne&s;s of the O&s;trich has pa&s;&s;ed into

a proverb, <HI>magro comme uno &s;truzzo</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Meagre as an O&s;trich.</Q></NOTE>; he adds, that tho&s;e which he examined appeared after
di&s;&s;ection like mere &s;keletons: but this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e with
re&s;pect to all O&s;triches that have no fat, or in which it has been
&s;eparated, &s;ince there is no fle&s;h on the brea&s;t or belly, for the

&s;ides.</P>
<P>If from the organs of dige&s;tion we pa&s;s to tho&s;e of generation, we &s;hall find other analogies to the &s;tructure which obtains in quadrupeds. In the greate&s;t number of birds, the <HI>penis</HI> is con|cealed; but in the O&s;trich it is apparent, and of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, compo&s;ed of two white liga|ments, that are &s;olid and nervous, four lines diameter, and &s;heathed in a thick membrane, and which only unite at the breadth of two fingers from their extremity. Sometimes we al&s;o meet in the &s;ame part a red &s;pongy &s;ub|&s;tance, &s;upplied with a multitude of ve&s;&s;els, and very &s;imilar to the <HI>corpus caverno&s;um</HI> that is ob|&s;erved in the land animals. The whole is in|clo&s;ed in a common membrane, who&s;e texture is the &s;ame as that of the ligaments, though not &s;o thick or hard. This <HI>penis</HI> is furni&s;hed with neither gland nor prepuce; nor, according to the anatomi&s;ts of the academy, is even per|forated for the ejection of the &s;eminal fluid; but Warren pretends that he di&s;&s;ected an O&s;trich, who&s;e yard was five inches and a half

<P>There are various opinions al&s;o with re&s;pect to the number and form of the cartilaginous rings of the <HI>larynx:</HI> Valli&s;nieri reckons only two hundred and eighteen, and maintains, with Perrault, that they are all entire: Warren found two hundred and twenty-&s;ix complete, exclu&s;ive of the fir&s;t ones which were imperfect, or tho&s;e immediately under the forking of the <HI>trachea.</HI> All this may be true, con&s;idering the great va|rieties to which the &s;tructure of the internal parts are &s;ubject; but it proves at the &s;ame time the ra&s;hne&s;s of attempting to de&s;cribe a whole &s;pecies from a &s;mall number of individuals, and the danger of mi&s;taking anomalous varieties for con&s;tant characters. Perrault ob&s;erved, that each of the two branches of the <HI>trachea-arteria</HI> is divided at its junction with the lungs into a number of membranous ramifications, as in the elephant. The brain, with its <HI>cerebellum,</HI> forms a ma&s;s about two inches and a half long, and

twenty lines broad. Valli&s;nieri affirms, that the one he examined weighed only an ounce, which would not amount to the one-twelfth-hundredth part of the weight of the animal: he adds, that the &s;tructure was exactly &s;imilar to that of the brain of other birds, and preci&s;ely &s;uch as de|&s;cribed by Willis. I &s;hall ob&s;erve however, with the Anatomi&s;ts of the Academy, that the ten pairs of nerves ari&s;e and proceed from the <HI>cranium,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as in land animals; that the cortical and the medullary part of the <HI>cerebellum</HI> are al&s;o di&s;po&s;ed as in the&s;e animals; and that we &s;ometimes find the two vermiform apophy&s;es which occur in man, and a ventricle, &s;haped like a writing pen, as in mo&s;t of the quadrupeds.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the organs of circulation, I &s;hall only notice, that the heart is almo&s;t round, while in other birds it is generally elongated.</P>
<P>In regard to the external &s;en&s;es, I have al|ready de&s;cribed the tongue, the ear, and the external form of the eye: I have only to add, that its internal &s;tructure is the &s;ame with what is commonly ob&s;erved in birds. Ranby a&s;|&s;erts, that the ball taken from its &s;ocket, &s;pon|taneou&s;ly a&s;&s;umes a form almo&s;t triangular; he al&s;o remarks, that the quantity of the aqueous humour is greater, and that of the vitreous le&s;s than ordinary.</P>

covered with a very thin membrane, and the&s;e apertures communicate with the palate by means of two canals which terminate in a pretty large cleft. We &s;hould be mi&s;taken, were we to infer from the complicated &s;tructure of this organ, that the O&s;trich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;en&s;e of &s;mell in an eminent degree; for the mo&s;t un|doubted facts prove exactly the rever&s;e; and in general it appears that the chief impre&s;&s;ions, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite which this animal re|ceives, are tho&s;e of &s;ight, and of the &s;ixth &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;hort view of the internal organization of the O&s;trich is more than &s;ufficient to confirm the idea which I before gave, that this &s;ingular animal mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a being of an equivocal nature, and as forming the &s;hade be|tween the quadruped and the bird: and in a &s;y&s;tem which would repre&s;ent the true gradation of the univer&s;e, it &s;hould be referred neither to the cla&s;s of quadrupeds nor to that of birds, but ranged in the intermediate place. Indeed, what rank can we a&s;&s;ign to an animal who&s;e body is partly that of a bird, partly that of a quadruped<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle.</NOTE>; its feet like tho&s;e of a quadruped, its head &s;imi|lar to that of a bird; the male furni&s;hed with a <HI>penis,</HI> the female with a <HI>clitoris,</HI> as in the qua|drupeds; which is oviparous, and has a gizzard like the birds, and at the &s;ame time is &s;upplied with &s;everal &s;tomachs, and with inte&s;tines, who&s;e
<PB N="343" REF="395">
capacity and &s;tructure are analogous partly to the ruminating, and partly to the other qua|drupeds?</P>
<P>In the order of fecundity, the O&s;trich &s;eems to be more nearly related to the quadrupeds than to the birds; for its incubations are frequent, and it hatches many young at a time. Ari&s;totle &s;ays, that, next after the O&s;trich, the bird which he calls the <HI>Atricapilla,</HI> is that which lays the mo&s;t eggs; and he adds, that this bird, <HI>Atri|capilla,</HI> lays twenty and more; whence it fol|lows that the O&s;trich lays at lea&s;t twenty-five. Be&s;ides, the be&s;t informed modern hi&s;torians and travellers relate, that it has &s;everal &s;ittings, with twelve or fifteen eggs in each. But if we refer it to the cla&s;s of the birds, it would be the large&s;t, and con&s;equently ought to be the lea&s;t prolific, according to the law which Nature &s;eems to have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved in the multiplication of ani|mals, that it is univer&s;ally proportional to the bulk of the individuals; whereas, if we refer it to the cla&s;s of land animals, it appears dimi|nutive be&s;ide the large&s;t &s;pecies, and &s;maller than tho&s;e of a middle &s;ize, as the hog, and its great fecundity is therefore con&s;i&s;tent with the general order of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Oppian, who entertained the &s;trange notion that the camels of Bactriana copulated back|wards, turning their tails to each other, believed al&s;o that the <HI>camel bird</HI> (the name anciently ap|plied to the O&s;trich) performs its embraces in

the &s;ame manner; and he advances it as an un|doubted fact. But this is no more probable with re&s;pect to the camel-bird than with re&s;pect to the camel it&s;elf; and though it is mo&s;t probable that few ob&s;ervers have witne&s;&s;ed their coupling, and that none have de&s;cribed it, we ought &s;till to conclude, &s;ince there is no proof of the contrary, that it is accompli&s;hed in the u&s;ual way.</P>
<P>The O&s;triches are reckoned exce&s;&s;ively &s;ala|cious, and often copulate; and if we recollect what has been already &s;aid with re&s;pect to the dimen&s;ions of the yard, we &s;hall readily con|ceive that this act is not performed by mere compre&s;&s;ion, as in almo&s;t all the other birds, but that the male organ is really introduced into the &s;exual parts of the female: Thevenot is the only per&s;on who a&s;&s;erts that they pair, and that, contrary to what is u&s;ual with the large birds, each male &s;elects his female.</P>
<P>The time of laying their eggs depends on the climate they inhabit, but is always near the &s;um|mer &s;ol&s;tice; that is, about the beginning of July, in the northern parts of Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albert.</NOTE>, and towards the end of December, in the &s;outhern tracts of that continent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dampier.</NOTE>. The temperature of the cli|mate has al&s;o great influence on the mode of hatching.

<PB N="345" REF="397">
leave the developement of the young to the powerful agency of a burning &s;un.

It has been a&s;&s;erted, that they are as large as the head of a child<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, that they would contain a quart<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, that they weigh fifteen pounds, and that an O&s;trich lays fifty<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Leo Africanus.</NOTE> eggs in the year; Aelian goes as far as eighty. But mo&s;t of the&s;e circum&s;tances are evidently exaggerated: for, fir&s;t, is it po&s;|&s;ible that an egg, who&s;e &s;hell is not more than a pound in weight, and who&s;e capacity is at mo&s;t only a quart, could weigh fifteen pounds? To reconcile this, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the yolk and white are &s;even times den&s;er than water, three times than marble, and almo&s;t as den&s;e as tin, which is rather a &s;trained hypothe&s;is. Secondly, Admitting with Willughby, that the O&s;trich lays annually fifty eggs, weighing fifteen pounds each, it would follow that, in the cour&s;e of the year, &s;he would exclude &s;even hundred
<PB N="347" REF="399">
and fifty pounds, which is too much for an ani|mal that is &s;carcely eighty pounds weight.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore make a con&s;iderable abate|ment both in the weight of the eggs, and in their number; but it is a pity that we have not &s;uffi|cient data to a&s;certain the preci&s;e quantity. Ari|&s;totle indeed renders it probable, that the num|ber of eggs is from twenty-five to thirty; and the mo&s;t judicious modern writers &s;tate it at thirty-&s;ix. If we &s;uppo&s;e two or three layings in the year, and a dozen eggs to each, we might al&s;o admit the weight of each egg to be three or four pounds, allowing a pound for the &s;hell, and two or three for the white and yolk; but this is merely conjecture, and far from being accurate. Many people write, but few weigh, mea&s;ure, or compare. Of fifteen or &s;ix|teen O&s;triches which have been di&s;&s;ected in different countries, only one has been weighed, and it is that which we have de&s;cribed from Valli&s;nieri.&mdash;We are no better informed with re&s;pect to the time nece&s;&s;ary for the incubation of the eggs; all we know, or rather all that is a&s;&s;erted is, that as &s;oon as they are hatched, the young O&s;triches are able to walk, and even to run and &s;earch for their food; ina&s;much that in the torrid zone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leo Africanus.</NOTE>, where they enjoy the proper degree of warmth, and can ea&s;ily provide their &s;uitable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they are emancipated at their birth, and abandoned by their mother, on

who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they are independent. But, in the more temperate countries, as at the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kolben's Account of the Cape.</BIBL></NOTE>, the mother watches over her young &s;o long as her a&s;&s;iduous attention is ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and in every climate her care is pro|portioned to their wants.</P>
<P>The young O&s;triches are of an a&s;h-gray the fir&s;t year, and entirely covered with feathers; but the&s;e are fal&s;e, and &s;oon drop. They are never re&s;tored on the head, on the top of the neck, on the things, on the &s;ides, and below the wings; but they are replaced on the re&s;t of the body by plumes alternately black and white, and &s;ometimes gray, from the blending the&s;e two co|lours into each other. The &s;horte&s;t are on the lower part of the neck; tho&s;e on the belly and the back are longer; but the longe&s;t of all are tho&s;e at the extremity of the tail and of the wings, and are al&s;o the mo&s;t e&s;teemed. Klein mentions, on the authority of Albert, that the dor&s;al feathers are very black in the males, and brown in the females; but the Academicians, who di&s;&s;ected eight O&s;triches, five male and three female, found the plumage nearly alike in all; yet they never ob&s;erved red, green, blue, or yellow feathers, as Cardan &s;eems to have be|lieved, from a &s;trange over&s;ight in a work <HI>De Subtilitate.</HI></P>
<P>Redi di&s;covered, from numerous ob&s;ervations,

that almo&s;t all birds are &s;ubject to vermin in their feathers, and even vermin of different kinds; that the greate&s;t number have in&s;ects pe|culiar to them, and no where el&s;e found; but in no &s;ea&s;on could he ever perceive them in O&s;triches, though he examined a dozen of tho&s;e animals, &s;ome of which had been recently brought from Barbary. Further, Valli&s;nieri, who diffected two O&s;triches, found in the bowels neither <HI>lum|brici,</HI> nor worms, nor in&s;ects of any &s;ort. It would &s;eem therefore, that none of the&s;e crea|tures are fond of the O&s;trich fle&s;h; that they avoid it with an aver&s;ion, and that it has &s;ome quality pernicious to their multiplication. Per|haps the breeding of vermin is prevented inter|nally by the great powers of the &s;tomach, and the dige&s;tive organs. Many fabulous opinions have been entertained on this &s;ubject. It has been a&s;&s;erted, that the O&s;trich dige&s;ts iron as poultry dige&s;t grain; and &s;ome authors have even gone &s;o far as to allege, that it could di|ge&s;t red-hot iron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Marmol, <HI>De&s;crip. de l'Afrique.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The la&s;t opinion requires no &s;erious refutation; and it will be enough to a&s;certain from facts, if the O&s;trich can grind down cold iron.</P>
<P>It is certain that the&s;e birds live chiefly on vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; that their gizzard is lined with very &s;trong mu&s;cles, as in all the granivo|rous
<PB N="350" REF="402">
cla&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the O&s;trich is actually omnivorous, it may &s;till be ranged in the granivorous cla&s;s, &s;ince in its de&s;erts it lives on dates, and other fruits, or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; and in <HI>menageries</HI> it may be kept on the &s;ame food. Al&s;o Strabo tells us, Book vi. that when the huntors want to en&s;nare it, they u&s;e grain for bait.</NOTE>; that they often &s;wallow bits of iron<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay often; for Albert affirms that many O&s;triches would not &s;wallow iron, though they devoured hard bones, and even &s;tones with avidity.</NOTE>, copper, &s;tones, gla&s;s, wood, and any thing that occurs. I will not deny that they may even &s;ometimes &s;wallow hot iron, if the quantity be &s;mall, and this perhaps without &s;uf|fering any inconvenience. It appears that they &s;wallow whatever they can find, till their capa|cious &s;tomachs be completely filled; and that the need of balla&s;ting them with a &s;ufficient weight, is one of the principal cau&s;es of their voracity. The gallinaceous tribe, and other granivorous animals, who&s;e organs of ta&s;te want &s;en&s;ibility, al&s;o &s;wallow many &s;mall &s;tones, when mixed with their food, mi&s;taking them probably for grains; but if &s;tones be offered alone, they will peri&s;h of hunger, and not touch one of them; and &s;till le&s;s will they meddle with quick-lime. We may therefore conclude, that the O&s;trich is one of the birds who&s;e &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and &s;mell are the mo&s;t obtu&s;e; and in this circum&s;tance they are widely &s;eparated from the quadrupeds.</P>
<P>But what become of tho&s;e hard noxious &s;ub|&s;tances, e&s;pecially the copper, the gla&s;s, and the iron, which the O&s;trich &s;wallows at random, and

merely with the view of repletion? On this &s;ub|ject the authors are divided, and adduce parti|cular facts in &s;upport of each opinion. Perrault, having found &s;eventy doubloons in the &s;tomach of one of the&s;e animals, ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of them were worn down, and reduced to three-fourths of their prominence. He conceived that this was occa&s;ioned by their mutual friction, and the comminution of pebbles, rather than by the ac|tion of any acid; &s;ince &s;ome of the&s;e doubloons were much corroded on the convex &s;urface, which was mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the attrition, and yet not in the lea&s;t affected on the concave &s;ide. He therefore concluded, that, in the&s;e birds, the &s;o|lution of the food is not performed merely by &s;ubtile and penetrating juices, but is effected by the organic action of the &s;tomach, which com|pre&s;&s;es its aliments, and agitates them ince&s;&s;antly with tho&s;e hard bodies which they in&s;tinctively &s;wallow. And, becau&s;e the contents of the &s;to|mach were tinged with green, he inferred that the copper was actually di&s;&s;olved in it; not by any particular &s;olvent, nor by the powers of di|ge&s;tion, but in a &s;imilar manner to what would take place if that metal were ground with herb|age, or with &s;ome acid or &s;aline liquor. He adds, that copper, far from affording nouri&s;h|ment in the &s;tomach of the O&s;trich, really acts as a poi&s;on, and that all tho&s;e who &s;wallowed much of it &s;oon died.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="404">
Valli&s;nieri, on the other hand, imagines, that the O&s;trich dige&s;ts or di&s;&s;olves the hard &s;ub|&s;tances chiefly by the action of the acid liquor of the &s;tomach; but he does not exclude the effect of attrition which may a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;olution. His proofs are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. Bits of wood, iron, or gla&s;s, which have remained &s;ome time in the &s;tomach of the O&s;|trich, are not &s;mooth and &s;hining, as they would be if worn by the friction of the coats; but are rough, furrowed, perforated, and preci&s;ely &s;uch as would be produced by the corro&s;ion of a &s;ol|vent.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;olvent reduces the harde&s;t and the &s;ofte&s;t bodies alike to impalpable molecules, which may be ob&s;erved by the micro&s;cope, and even by the naked eye.</P>
<P N="3">3. He found in the &s;tomach of the O&s;trich a nail fixed in one of the &s;ides, in &s;uch a manner as to prevent its meeting the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and con|&s;equently the compre&s;&s;ion of the contents; yet the food was as completely di&s;&s;olved in this ven|tricle as in another in which the u&s;ual action could take place; and this at lea&s;t proves, that in the O&s;trich dige&s;tion is not performed &s;olely by tritu|ration.</P>
<P N="4">4. He ob&s;erved a copper thimble in the &s;to|mach of a capon, which was corroded only where it touched the gizzard, and con&s;equently where it was lea&s;t expo&s;ed to the attrition of the
<PB N="353" REF="405">
hard &s;ub&s;tances; whence the &s;olution of metals in the gallinaceous tribe mu&s;t be a&s;cribed rather to the action of &s;ome men&s;truum, than to the pre&s;&s;ure and re&s;i&s;tance of the coats; and the ana|logy naturally extends to the O&s;trich.</P>
<P N="5">5. He di&s;covered in the &s;tomach of the O&s;|trich, a piece of money which had been &s;o com|pletely corroded, that its weight was reduced to three grains.</P>
<P N="6">6. The glands of the fir&s;t &s;tomach exude, when &s;queezed, a vi&s;cous, yellowi&s;h, in&s;ipid li|quor, which, however, quickly marks iron with a dull &s;pot.</P>
<P N="7">7. La&s;tly, the activity of the&s;e juices, the force of the mu&s;cles of the gizzard, and the black colour which tinges the excrements of the O&s;triches that have &s;wallowed iron, which al&s;o happens to tho&s;e per&s;ons who u&s;e martial pre|parations, and have a vigorous dige&s;tion, &s;up|porting the preceding facts, incline Valli&s;nieri to conjecture, not indeed that the O&s;triches really dige&s;t iron, and are nouri&s;hed by it, as &s;everal in&s;ects and reptiles feed on earth and &s;tones, but that the &s;tones and the metals, e&s;pecially iron, being di&s;&s;olved by the ga&s;tric liquor, tem|per, like ab&s;orbents, the acrid juices of the &s;to|mach, and mix with the nutriment as u&s;eful ingredients for &s;ea&s;oning it, and increa&s;ing the action of the &s;olids. And this conclu&s;ion is the more rea&s;onable, &s;ince iron is known to enter into the compo&s;ition of living beings; and,
<PB N="354" REF="406">
when &s;ufficiently attenuated by proper acids, it becomes volatile, and &s;hews a tendency as it were to vegetate, and a&s;&s;ume forms analogous to tho&s;e of plants, as is ob&s;erved in the <HI>arbor Mar|tis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences</HI></BIBL>, <HI>ann&eacute;es</HI> 1705, 1706, <HI>&amp; &s;ui|vantes</HI>; <BIBL>VALLISNIERI.</BIBL> His opinion is farther confirmed by the ob&s;ervations of Santorini on bits of money, and keys found in the &s;tomach of an O&s;trich which was di&s;&s;ected at Venice; and by the experiments of the Academy <HI>de Cimento</HI> on the dige&s;tion of birds.</NOTE>.

The&s;e regions, which are the native abodes of the came, the rhinoceros, the elephant, and many other large animals, mu&s;t al&s;o be the paternal &s;eat of the O&s;trich, which is the elephant of the birds. They are very numerous, according to Dr. Po|cock, on the mountains &s;ituated on the &s;outh|we&s;t of Alexandria. A mi&s;&s;ionary mentions that they occur at Goa, though much more rarely than in Arabia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Travels of Father Philip, a bare-footed Carmelite.</NOTE>. Philo&s;tratus pretends that Apollonius found them even beyond the Ganges<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Life of Apollonius, book iii.</BIBL></NOTE>; but this was certainly at a period when Hindo&s;tan was le&s;s populous than at pre|&s;ent.

<PB N="356" REF="408">
that is, they cannot migrate into the new continent. Hence they have never been di&s;|covered through the whole range of America, though the name has been applied to the Tou|you, which is analogous to them indeed, but is quite a different &s;pecies, as we &s;hall &s;oon find. For the &s;ame rea&s;on they have never been found in Europe, though they might enjoy a climate &s;uited to their nature in the Morea, in the &s;outh of Spain, and in Italy. But, before they could migrate into the&s;e countries, they mu&s;t have cro&s;&s;ed the intervening &s;eas, which was impo&s;|&s;ible; or follow the line of coa&s;t as high as the fiftieth degree of latitude, another ob&s;tacle equally in&s;urmountable for an animal that de|lights in the parched plains.

G.

drink. They a&s;&s;emble in the&s;e de&s;erts in numerous flocks, which at a
di&s;tance <PB N="357" REF="409"> re&s;emble troops of cavalry, and as &s;uch
have alarmed many caravans. Their life mu&s;t be &s;pent rather hardly in
the&s;e va&s;t barren &s;olitudes; but there they ta&s;te the &s;weets of
liberty and love. And is not the de&s;ert which offers the&s;e ravi&s;hing
plea&s;ures converted into an Ely&s;ian field? To enjoy the&s;e ine&s;timable
ble&s;&s;ings they fly the pre&s;ence of man; but man learns the profit he can
derive from them; he haunts them in their mo&s;t &s;avage retreats; he feeds on
their eggs, their blood, their fat, their fle&s;h; decks him&s;elf with their
plumes; and perhaps he flat|ters him&s;elf with the hope of completely
&s;ub|duing them, and of ranking them among the number of his &s;laves. The
advantages which the dome&s;tication of the O&s;trich promi&s;es are &s;o
important, as to threaten its &s;ecurity, even in the de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Whole nations have merited the name of <HI>Struthophagi,</HI> from the cu&s;tom of feeding on the O&s;trich; and the&s;e people bordered on the <HI>Ele|phantophagi,</HI> who had not better cheer. For this di&s;h Apicius directs, and with great rea&s;on, a poignant &s;ort of &s;auce; which proves that it was u&s;ed among the Romans; but we have other evidences. The Emperor Heliogabalus once ordered the brains of &s;ix hundred O&s;triches to be &s;erved up for a &s;ingle repa&s;t. That mon|&s;ter, it is well known, had a whim of eating each day only a &s;ingle kind of food; &s;uch as phea&s;ants, hogs, pullets, &amp;c. and the O&s;trich was of the
<PB N="358" REF="410">
number, but &s;ea&s;oned no doubt after the <HI>recipe</HI> of Apicius. Even at pre&s;ent the inhabitants of Lybia, Numidia, &amp;c. feed upon tame ones; eat the fle&s;h, and &s;ell the feathers: yet neither the dogs nor the cats would touch the fragments of the O&s;trich di&s;&s;ected by Valli&s;nieri, though it was fre&s;h and florid. It is indeed true that the O&s;|trich was extremely lean, and was perhaps old; but Leo Africanus, who ta&s;ted them in their na|tive de&s;erts, informs us, that they were &s;eldom eaten, except when young, and even after being fattened. The Rabbi, David Kimchi, adds, that the females were preferred; and perhaps the fle&s;h was rendered more palatable by ca&s;|tration.</P>
<P>Cadamo&s;to and &s;ome other travellers men|tion their having ta&s;ted O&s;trich eggs, which they found not to be unplea&s;ant food; De Brue and Le Maire affirm, that a &s;ingle one is a meal &s;uf|ficient for eight men; and others a&s;&s;ert, that it weighs as much as thirty hen eggs; but even this is far &s;hort of fifteen pounds.</P>
<P>The &s;hell of the&s;e eggs is formed into various &s;orts of cups, which in time grow hard, and in &s;ome degree re&s;emble ivory.</P>
<P>When the Arabians have killed an O&s;trich, they open its throat, and make a ligature below the inci&s;ion; three or four of them then take it, and &s;hake it backwards and forwards, as we would rin&s;e a bottle: the ligature being then removed, a con&s;iderable quantity of <HI>manteca,</HI>
<PB N="359" REF="411">
of the con&s;i&s;tence of concrete oil, oozes from the hole. They extract &s;ometimes as much as twenty pounds from a &s;ingle O&s;trich; and this <HI>manteca</HI> is nothing but the blood of the ani|mal mixed, not with the fle&s;h as has been al|leged, &s;ince there is none on the belly and brea&s;t, but with that fat, which in plump O&s;triches forms, as we have &s;aid, a coat &s;everal inches thick on the inte&s;tines. The natives of the coun|try a&s;&s;ert that the <HI>manteca</HI> is plea&s;ant to eat, but occa&s;ions a loo&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ethiopians flay the O&s;triches, and &s;ell their &s;kins to the merchants of Alexandria. The leather is very thick, and the Arabians formerly made it into inner jackets, which &s;erved in&s;tead of a cuira&s;s and buckler. Belon &s;aw large quan|tities of the&s;e &s;kins &s;tripped of their feathers in the &s;hops at Alexandria.&mdash;The long white plumes of the tail and wings have always been highly e&s;teemed; the ancients u&s;ed them for decoration, and appropriated them to di&s;tingui&s;h the mili|tary profe&s;&s;ion, in which they &s;ucceeded to the feathers of the &s;wan; for birds have always furni&s;hed the poli&s;hed nations, as well as the &s;avage tribes, with the materials of ornament. Aldrovandus informs us, that there are &s;till pre|&s;erved at Rome two ancient &s;tatues, one of Minerva and another of Pyrrhus, in which the helmet is decked with the plumes of the O&s;trich. It &s;eems probable that the&s;e al&s;o compo&s;ed the bunch worn by the Roman &s;oldiers, which Po|lybius
<PB N="360" REF="412">
mentions, and which con&s;i&s;ted of three black or red feathers, about a cubit in height. In Turkey, even at pre&s;ent, a Jani&s;&s;ary, who has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his warlike atchieve|ments, is entitled to wear them in his turban; and in the &s;eraglio, the Sultana, when &s;he would heighten her charms to obtain a gentler conque&s;t, employs them to decorate her per&s;on. In the kingdom of Congo, the&s;e feathers are mixed with tho&s;e of the peacock, to form en&s;igns of war; and the ladies of England and of Italy make them into a &s;ort of fans. It is well known what prodigious con&s;umption is made of them in Europe for hats, helmets, theatrical dre&s;&s;es, fur|niture, canopies, funeral decorations, and even for female ornaments: and indeed it mu&s;t be allowed, that they have a fine effect, both from their natural and their artificial colours, and from their gentle waving motion. But it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the feathers mo&s;t admired, are tho&s;e which are plucked from the animal while alive; and are known by this pro|perty, that when the quill is pre&s;&s;ed by the fingers, it di&s;charges a bloody liquor, while tho&s;e that are pulled after death are dry, light, and very liable to worms.</P>
<P>The O&s;triches, though inhabitants of the de|&s;ert, are not &s;o wild as might be &s;uppo&s;ed. All travellers agree in &s;aying, that they are ea&s;ily tamed, e&s;pecially when young. The people of Dara, of Lybia, &amp;c. breed them in flocks, and
<PB N="361" REF="413">
undoubtedly obtain from them feathers of the be&s;t &s;ort, which are only gotten from living O&s;triches. They even grow dome&s;tic without much trouble, merely from the habit of &s;eeing men, and receiving food, and experiencing kind treatment. Brue, having purcha&s;ed two of them at Serinpate on the coa&s;t of Africa, found them quite tame when he arrived at Fort St. Louis.</P>
<P>They have even been brought farther than dome&s;tication, and &s;ome have trained them to carry their rider like a hor&s;e. Nor is this a modern invention; for the tyrant Firmius, who reigned in Egypt about the end of the third century, u&s;ed, it is &s;aid, to be carried on large O&s;triches. Moore, an Engli&s;hman, mentions, that he &s;aw at Joar in Africa, a man travelling on an O&s;trich. Valli&s;nieri &s;peaks of a young man who mounted on an O&s;trich, exhibited at Venice before the rabble; and Adan&s;on &s;aw, at the factory of Podor, two young O&s;triches, the &s;tronge&s;t of which ran fa&s;ter than the be&s;t Engli&s;h hunter, though it carried two negroes on its back. All this proves that the&s;e animals, though not ab&s;olutely intractable, are yet of a &s;tubborn nature, and if they could be taught &s;o much as to keep together in flocks, and re|turn to their &s;table, and even to allow them&s;elves to be mounted, it would &s;till be difficult and per|haps impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;truct them to obey the reins, to feel the wi&s;h of the rider, and comply with it.
<PB N="362" REF="414">
We &s;ee, even from the relation of Adan&s;on, that the O&s;trich of Podor did not make a di&s;tant &s;tretch, but only took &s;everal turns round the hamlet, and that its cour&s;e could only be &s;top|ped by throwing &s;ome ob&s;tacle in its way. Do|cile to a certain degree of &s;tupidity, it &s;eems in|tractable from its nature; and this mu&s;t be really the ca&s;e, &s;ince the Arab, who has tamed the hor&s;e and en&s;laved the camel, has never completely &s;ubdued the O&s;trich; but till this be obtained, advantage can neither be derived from its &s;peed nor its force, for the &s;trength of an indocile do|me&s;tic is always hurtful to its ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But, though the O&s;triches run fa&s;ter than the hor&s;e, they are yet caught by means of hor&s;es; but to &s;ucceed requires dexterity. The plan which the Arabs take is to keep con&s;tantly within &s;ight of them, without pre&s;&s;ing them too hard; they are particularly careful not to &s;uffer them to feed, though not to di&s;turb them &s;o much as to tempt them to make their e&s;cape by a &s;udden flight. And the execution is the more ea&s;y, &s;ince they &s;eldom hold a &s;traight cour&s;e, but almo&s;t always de&s;cribe a circle. The Arabs therefore, tracing a &s;maller circle within the other, can al|ways keep their proper di&s;tance, and yet pa&s;s over much le&s;s ground. After a day or two, when the O&s;triches are worn out with fa|tigue and want of food, the hor&s;emen &s;uddenly dart upon them at full gallop, endeavouring as much as po&s;&s;ible to drive them again&s;t the wind,
<PB N="363" REF="415">
and they kill them with the blows of a &s;tick, that the blood may not &s;poil the fine white of the plumes. It is &s;aid, that when they feel them&s;elves overcome, and unable to e&s;cape from the hunters, they conceal their head, and ima|gine that they cannot then be perceived; but that ab&s;urdity mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to tho&s;e who attempt to conjecture their intentions; it is evi|dent that they only try to protect that part of their body at la&s;t, which is at once the weake&s;t and the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>The <HI>Struthophagi</HI> had another method of catching the&s;e animals: they covered them&s;elves with an O&s;trich's &s;kin, and &s;lipping their arms into the neck, they imitated all the ordinary motions of the O&s;trich it&s;elf, and thus were able to get near it and &s;urpri&s;e it. In the &s;ame manner, the &s;avages of America di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves like roe|bucks, to catch the roe-bucks.</P>
<P>Dogs and nets al&s;o have been u&s;ed, but it would &s;eem that the hor&s;e is mo&s;t commonly employed; and this circum&s;tance alone is &s;uf|ficient to explain the antipathy which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the hor&s;e and the O&s;trich.</P>
<P>In running, it &s;preads its wings and the large feathers of its tail, not with the view to a&s;&s;i&s;t its motion, as I have already &s;aid, but from the common effect of the corre&s;pondence of mu&s;cles; ju&s;t as a man running throws about his arms, or an elephant that turns upon its hunter, erects and
<PB N="364" REF="416">
di&s;plays its large ears. But the complete proof that the O&s;trich does not rai&s;e its feathers to in|crea&s;e its celerity is, that it &s;preads them, even when it runs again&s;t the wind; in which ca&s;e they can only retard its progre&s;s. If we con|&s;ider that bulk and &s;wiftne&s;s are combined in the O&s;trich, we mu&s;t be convinced that they are extremely &s;trong; yet it pre&s;erves the manners of the granivorous animals: it never attacks the weak, and &s;eldom oppo&s;es the a&s;&s;aults of the &s;trong. Covered with a hard thick coat of leather, and furni&s;hed with a broad <HI>&s;ternum,</HI> which &s;erves for a brea&s;t-plate, and defended by another callous brea&s;t-plate, it hardly feels the application of external blows; and it e&s;capes from the greater and more &s;erious dangers by the rapidity of its flight. If it &s;ometimes makes re&s;i&s;tance, it employs its bill, the points of its wings, and particularly its feet. Thevenot &s;aw one which overthrew a dog by a blow of its foot. Belon &s;ays that it could run down a man; but that in its flight it throws &s;tones at its pur|&s;uer. I doubt the fact, e&s;pecially as its velocity would only dimini&s;h that of the &s;tones which it might throw, the two motions being oppo&s;ite. Be&s;ides, this fact, advanced by Pliny, and copied by many others, does not appear to be confirmed by any modern of credit, and it is known that Pliny po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more genius than di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>Leo Africanus &s;ays, that the O&s;trich wants the &s;en&s;e of hearing; yet we have already &s;een
<PB N="365" REF="417">
that it appears to have all the organs which give tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations; the aperture of the ears is even very wide, and is not ob&s;tructed by feathers. It is probable therefore, that either like the grous, it is only deaf in the &s;ea&s;on of love; or that what has been imputed to its deafne&s;s, is really the effect of &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t likely that this is the &s;ea&s;on when its cry is heard: this happens &s;eldom, for few per&s;ons have mentioned it. The &s;acred writers com|pare its cry to moaning, and it is even pretend|ed that its Hebrew name <HI>jacnah</HI> is derived from <HI>ianah,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>to howl.</HI> Dr. Brown &s;ays, that it re&s;embles the wailing of a hoar&s;e child, and is &s;till more plaintive; how gloomy is it then, and even terrible, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of Sandys, to travellers who penetrate with timorous apprehen&s;ions into the immen&s;ity of the&s;e de&s;erts, where every living being, man not excepted, is an object of dread and danger!</P>

<P>WHAT is called the O&s;trich of South Ame|rica, or the <HI>O&s;trich of the Straits of Ma|gellan and Guiana,</HI> is quite different from the O&s;trich; and Le Maire is, I believe, the fir&s;t traveller, who, deceived by &s;ome traces of re|&s;emblance to that African bird, has given it the &s;ame name. Klein, who perceived that it was of another &s;pecies, is contented with calling it <HI>the Ba&s;tard O&s;trich.</HI> Barrere has &s;ometimes termed it the <HI>Heron,</HI> &s;ometimes the <HI>ferrivorous Crane,</HI> and &s;ometimes the <HI>Long-necked Emeu.</HI> Others have with more accuracy applied a com|pound name, expre&s;&s;ive of &s;everal of its quali|ties, <HI>the Gray Ca&s;&s;owary with the O&s;trich-bill.</HI> Moehring and Bri&s;&s;on prefer the Latin name <HI>rhea,</HI> to which the latter annexes the Ameri|can epithet <HI>Touyou,</HI> formed from <HI>Touyouyou,</HI> by which it is generally known in Guiana. The &s;avages &s;ettled in other parts of the continent
<PB N="367" REF="419">
have given it different names: <HI>Yardu, Yandu, Andu,</HI> and <HI>Nandu-guacu,</HI> in Brazil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg, Marcgrave, and Pi&s;o.</NOTE>; <HI>Sallian</HI> in the i&s;land of Maragnan<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tome xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>; <HI>Suri</HI> in Chili, &amp;c. So many names have been be&s;towed on an animal with which we were &s;o lately made acquainted! For my part, I &s;hall readily adopt that of <HI>Touyou,</HI> which Bri&s;&s;on has applied or rather retained, and I &s;hall not he&s;itate to pre|fer this barbarous word, which has probably &s;ome analogy with the voice or cry of that bird, to the &s;cientific terms, which only &s;erve to con|vey fal&s;e notions, and to new names, which mark no character, no e&s;&s;ential property of the animal on which they are be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on &s;eems to imagine that Aldrovandus meant to figure this bird by the name of <HI>Avis Eme</HI>; and it is true that we find, in the 541&s;t page of vol. iii. of his Ornithology, a plate which repre&s;ents the Touyou and the Ca&s;&s;owary, according to the two plates of Nieremberg, and that it is in&s;cribed in large characters with the words AVIS EME; in the &s;ame manner as the figure of the Touyou in Nieremberg bears the name of <HI>Emeu.</HI> But it is obvious that the&s;e two titles have been added by engravers or printers who were little acquainted with the views of the authors: for Aldrovandus does not mention a &s;ingle word of the Touyou, and Nieremberg only
<PB N="368" REF="420">
calls it <HI>Yardou, Suri,</HI> and the <HI>Occidental O&s;trich</HI>; and both, in their de&s;cription, apply the names <HI>Eme</HI> and <HI>Emeu</HI> to the Ca&s;&s;owary of Java alone. In &s;hort, to avoid confu&s;ion of names, the <HI>Eme</HI> of Aldrovandus and the <HI>Emeu</HI> of Nieremberg ought henceforth to be excluded from the &s;yno|nyms of the <HI>Touyou.</HI> Marcgrave &s;ays, that the Portugue&s;e call it <HI>Ema</HI> in their language; but the Portugue&s;e, who had often vi&s;ited the Ea&s;t Indies, were acquainted with the <HI>Emeu</HI> of Java, and applied that name to the Touyou of America, which was more analogous to it than any other bird; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that we have applied the term <HI>O&s;trich</HI> to the &s;ame <HI>Touyou.</HI> We mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider it as an e&s;tabli&s;hed point, that the <HI>Emeu</HI> belongs exclu|&s;ively to the Ca&s;&s;owary of the Ea&s;t Indies, and has no relation to the Touyou, or any other American bird.</P>
<P>In this detail of the different names of the <HI>Touyou,</HI> I have in part pointed out the different countries where it is found. It is a native of South America, but is not equally common in every province of that exten&s;ive country. Marc|grave informs us, that it is &s;eldom &s;een in the vi|cinity of Fernambuca, and is equally rare in Peru, and along the mo&s;t populous coa&s;ts; but it is more frequent in Guiana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barrere.</NOTE>; in the &s;eigno|ries of Seregippe and of Rio-grande; in the
<PB N="369" REF="421">
interior provinces of Brazil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.</NOTE>; in Chili<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. des Gen. Voyages, tome xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>; in the va&s;t fore&s;ts &s;ituated north from the mouth of the De la Plata<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. des Incas.</BIBL></NOTE>; and in the va&s;t &s;avannas which &s;tretch on the &s;outh of that river, and in all the <HI>terra Magellanica,</HI> as far as Port De&s;ire, and even to the coa&s;t bordering on the &s;traits of Magellan<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Wafer.</NOTE>. Formerly &s;ome di&s;tricts in Para|guay &s;warmed with the&s;e birds, e&s;pecially the plains watered by the Uraguay; but as the in|habitants multiplied, they killed great numbers, and forced the re&s;t to retire. Captain Wood a&s;&s;ures us, that though they abound on the northern coa&s;t of the Straits of Magellan, there is not one to be found on the &s;outhern &s;hore: and notwith&s;tanding Coreal's affirming that he &s;aw them on the i&s;lands in the South Sea, the&s;e &s;traits &s;eem to bound the climate &s;uited to the Touyou, as the Cape of Good Hope terminates the region of the O&s;trich; and the i&s;lands where Coreal &s;aw the Touyous were probably contiguous to the ea&s;tern &s;hores of America, beyond the Straits of Magellan. It al&s;o appears that the Touyou, which, like the O&s;trich, delights in the heat of the torrid zone, is yet not &s;o much affected by cold; for the promontory which runs into the Straits of Ma|gellan is nearer the Pole, than the Cape of Good Hope, or any other climate, where the O&s;trich
<PB N="370" REF="422">
has &s;pontaneou&s;ly fixed its re&s;idence: but, as according to all accounts, the Touyou is al&s;o, like the O&s;trich, entirely a terre&s;trial bird, and incapable of flying; and as South America is &s;eparated from the ancient continent by immen&s;e oceans; it would follow that we ought not to expect to find Touyous in our continent, any more than to di&s;cover O&s;triches in America: and this inference agrees with the te&s;timony of travellers.</P>
<P>The Touyou, though &s;omewhat inferior to the O&s;trich, is yet the large&s;t bird in the New World, the full grown ones being &s;ix feet high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the figure that Nieremberg gives, there is a &s;ort of cap on the crown of the head, which re&s;embles the hard callous &s;kin that, according to Dr. Brown, is found on the &s;ame part of the O&s;trich: but no mention is made of this cap in Nieremberg's de|&s;cription, or in any other.</NOTE>. Wafer, who mea&s;ured the thigh of one above the ordinary &s;ize, found it almo&s;t equal to that of a man. It has the long neck, the &s;mall head, and the flat bill of the O&s;trich; but in other re&s;pects, it re&s;embles the Ca&s;&s;owary. I find even in the hi&s;tory of Brazil, written by the Abbe Prevot<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tome xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>, but no where el&s;e, mention made of a kind of horn which this bird has on its bill, and which, if it really exi&s;ted, would be another point of analogy with the Ca&s;&s;owary.</P>
<P>Its body is of an oval &s;hape, and, when cloth|ed with all its feathers, appears almo&s;t entirely round. Its wings are very &s;hort, and of no u&s;e
<PB N="371" REF="423">
in flying; though they are &s;aid to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in run|ning. It has on the back and about the rump long feathers, which fall back, and conceal the <HI>anus,</HI> and it has no other tail. Its plumage is all gray on the back, and white on the belly. It is very tall, having three toes to each foot, all anterior; for we cannot con&s;ider as a toe that callous round tubercle placed behind, and on which the foot re&s;ts as on a claw. To this con|formation is imputed the difficulty with which it &s;tands on a &s;mooth &s;urface, and of walking on it without falling; in compen&s;ation, however, it runs very &s;wiftly in open ground, rai&s;ing &s;ome|times one wing, &s;ometimes another, but for pur|po&s;es that have not yet been well a&s;certained. Marcgrave &s;uppo&s;es, that it is with the view of &s;preading a &s;ort of &s;ail to catch the wind; Nie|remberg, that it is to throw the &s;cent from the dogs which pur&s;ue it; Pi&s;o and Klein, that it is to change frequently the direction of its cour&s;e, by the&s;e zig-zags to avoid the arrows of the &s;a|vages; and others imagine, that it &s;eeks to in|crea&s;e its &s;peed by pricking it&s;elf with a kind of needle with which its wings are armed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that neither Pi&s;o, Marcgrave, nor any who ever &s;aw the Touyou, take the lea&s;t notice of this wing-&s;pur; and it is not unlikely that it was be&s;towed merely from the analogy &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between it and the African O&s;trich.&mdash;What mi&s;takes are occa&s;ioned by the confu&s;ion of names?</NOTE>. But whatever be the intention of the Touyous, cer|tain it is that they run with a&s;toni&s;hing velocity, and that it is difficult for any hound to overtake
<PB N="372" REF="424">
them. It is related of one, that perceiving it&s;elf &s;topt, it darted with &s;uch rapidity as di&s;engaged it&s;elf from the dogs, and e&s;caped to the moun|tains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Navigations aux Terres Au&s;trales.</BIBL></NOTE>. It being impo&s;&s;ible to out&s;trip them by agility, the &s;avages are obliged to employ addre&s;s, and to lay &s;nares for catching them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;toire Gen. des Voyages, tom. xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>. Marc|grave &s;ays, that they live on fle&s;h and fruits; but if they had been ob&s;erved with attention, it would undoubtedly have been di&s;covered which of the&s;e two kinds of aliments they prefer. For want of facts, we may conjecture that the&s;e birds having the &s;ame in&s;tinct with the O&s;triches, and other frugivorous animals, viz. that of &s;wal|lowing &s;tones, iron, and other hard &s;ub&s;tances, that they are al&s;o frugivorous, and that if they &s;ometimes eat fle&s;h, it is either becau&s;e they are pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, or, like the O&s;trich, their &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and &s;mell being only in an infe|rior degree, they &s;wallow indi&s;criminately what|ever comes in their way.</P>
<P>Nieremberg relates very &s;trange &s;tories in re|gard to their mode of propagation. According to this writer, the male performs the office of hatching the eggs; for this purpo&s;e he a&s;&s;embles twenty or thirty females to lay in the &s;ame ne&s;t, and after they have depo&s;ited their eggs, he drives them forcibly away, and covers them him&s;elf, taking the &s;ingular precaution however to re|move two of the eggs from the ne&s;t; the&s;e two
<PB N="373" REF="425">
become addle, which the male perceiving, breaks one of them, which invites a multitude of flies, beetles, and other &s;mall in&s;ects, on which the young Touyous feed; and after the fir&s;t is con|&s;umed, he opens another for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But all this may happen, without recurring to an extraordinary &s;uppo&s;ition; the addle eggs may be cru&s;hed by accident, and in&s;ects attract|ed, which &s;ometimes &s;erve to nouri&s;h the young Touyous. We can &s;u&s;pect here the intention of the parent only; for the&s;e intentions, which we liberally impute to animals, always form the ro|mance of natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the a&s;&s;ertion, that the male takes upon him&s;elf, to the exclu&s;ion of the fe|males, the care of hatching, I am much inclined to doubt the fact, conceive it as not authentic, and as incon&s;i&s;tent with the order of nature. But it is not enough to point out the cau&s;es of error; we ought, as much as we are able, to di&s;|cover the cau&s;es of it, which &s;ometimes lead us al&s;o to the truth. I &s;hould therefore imagine that this report is occa&s;ioned by the finding of te&s;ticles in &s;ome &s;itters; and perhaps an appear|ance of the <HI>penis,</HI> as is ob&s;erved in the female O&s;trich, which &s;eemed to evince it to be a male.</P>
<P>Wafer &s;ays, that he &s;aw in a de&s;ert tract &s;itu|ated on the north of the De la Plata, about the thirty-fifth degree of &s;outh latitude, a number of the eggs of the Touyou in the &s;and, where, ac|cording to him, the&s;e birds left them to hatch.
<PB N="374" REF="426">
If this fact be true, the de&s;cription which Nie|remberg gives with re&s;pect to the incubation of the&s;e eggs, can only refer to a climate that is colder, and nearer the pole. In fact, the Dutch found near Port De&s;ire, which is in the forty|&s;eventh degree of &s;outh latitude, a Touyou that was &s;itting, which they chaced away, and reckoned nineteen eggs in the ne&s;t. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the O&s;triches &s;eldom or never hatch at all in the torrid zone, but cover their eggs at the Cape of Good Hope, where the heat of the climate is inadequate to the effect.</P>
<P>When the young Touyous are newly ex|cluded from the &s;hell, they are very familiar, and follow the fir&s;t per&s;on whom they meet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">I have my&s;elf,</Q> &s;ays Wafer, <Q REND="inline">been followed by many of the&s;e young O&s;triches, which are ino&s;&s;en&s;ive and un&s;u&s;picious.</Q> <BIBL>DAMPIER.</BIBL></NOTE>; but as they grow up, they acquire experience, and become
&s;hy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">There is a great number of O&s;triches in this i&s;land of Port De&s;ire, which are very wild.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Voyage des Hollandois aux Indes Ori|entales.</HI></BIBL>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">I &s;aw at Port De&s;ire three O&s;triches, though I could not get near enough to fire at them; as &s;oon as they perceived me they fled.</Q><BIBL><HI>Navig. aux Terres Au&s;trales.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. It appears that in general their fle&s;h is plea&s;ant to eat;
though that of the old ones indeed is tough, and of a bad flavour. This fle&s;h
might be improved by rai&s;ing flocks of young Touyous, which would be ea&s;y,
con|&s;idering their aptne&s;s to be tamed; and, by fat|tening them, and
u&s;ing the precautions which have &s;ucceeded with the turkey, which al&s;o

countries on the continent of America.</P>
<P>Their feathers are far from being &s;o beautiful as tho&s;e of the O&s;trich; and Correal even a&s;&s;erts that they are totally u&s;ele&s;s. It is to be wi&s;hed, that in&s;tead of telling us their little value, tra|vellers had given us a preci&s;e idea of their tex|ture.&mdash;Too much has been written on the O&s;|trich, and too little on the Touyou. In giving a hi&s;tory of the former, the chief difficulty con|&s;i&s;ts in collecting all the facts, in comparing the relations, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the opinions, and in &s;e|parating the truth from a heap of rubbi&s;h. To di&s;cour&s;e on the Touyou, we mu&s;t often conjec|ture what <HI>is,</HI> from what <HI>may be</HI>; we are obliged to comment, to interpret, to &s;upply; and when facts cannot be had, to &s;ub&s;titute what is pro|bable in their &s;tead; and, in a word, to remain in &s;u&s;pence till future ob&s;ervations can be pro|cured to &s;upply the blanks in its hi&s;tory. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The &s;pecific character of the Touyou, <HI>Struthio Rhea,</HI> LINN. is, that <Q REND="inline">the foot has three toes, the hind one rounded.</Q> LATHAM makes it a genus of which only one &s;pecies, the <HI>Americana,</HI> is known. <Q REND="inline">The <HI>bill</HI> is &s;traight, depre&s;&s;ed, and roundi&s;h at the tip; the <HI>wings</HI> are un fit for flying; the lower part of the <HI>thighs</HI> naked; the <HI>feet</HI> are furni&s;hed with three toes before, and behind with a round cal|lous bump.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THE Dutch are the fir&s;t who &s;hewed this bird in Europe; they brought it, in 1597, from the i&s;land of Java, on their return from the fir&s;t voyage which they performed to the Ea&s;t Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tome</HI> viii</BIBL>, and <BIBL>CLUSIUS, <HI>Exotic.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The natives of the country call it <HI>Eme,</HI> from which the French have formed the word <HI>Emeu.</HI> It was al&s;o named <HI>Ca&s;&s;owary,</HI> which I have adopted, &s;ince it has been appropriated to this bird.</P>
<P>The Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary, though not &s;o large as the O&s;trich, is apparently more bulky; be|cau&s;e its ma&s;s is nearly the &s;ame, and its neck and feet are &s;horter and thicker in proportion; and its body is more protuberant, which gives it a heavier look.</P>
<P>The one de&s;cribed by the Academicians was five feet and a half long, from the point of the bill to the extremity of the claws; that ob&s;erv|ed by Clu&s;ius was a fourth &s;maller. Houtman reckons it double the bulk of the &s;wan; and other Dutchmen mention it as of the &s;ize of a
<PB N="377" REF="429">
&s;heep. This variety of mea&s;ures, &s;o far from affecting the truth, is what alone informs us of the real magnitude of the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary; for the &s;ize of an individual is not that of the &s;pecies, and to e&s;timate that properly, we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as a quantity varying between cer|tain limits. Hence a naturali&s;t who compares with judgment the de&s;criptions of different ob|&s;ervers, will have more preci&s;e and accurate ideas of the &s;pecies, than an ob&s;erver who is only ac|quainted with a &s;ingle individual.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t remarkable in the figure of the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary, is that kind of conical hel|met, the fore-part of which is black, and the re&s;t yellow, which covers the face from the bottom of the bill to the middle of the crown of the head, and &s;ometimes &s;tretches farther. This hel|met is formed by the protuberance of the bones in that part of the cranium, and is &s;heathed by a hard covering, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal concentric plates analogous to the &s;ub&s;tance of an ox's horn. Its entire &s;hape re&s;embles a truncated cone, three inches high, an inch diameter at the ba&s;e, and three lines at its vertex. Clu&s;ius thought that this helmet dropped every year with the feathers, in the &s;ea&s;on of moulting; but the Academicians have properly ob&s;erved, that the external &s;heath only could thus fall, and not the inner &s;ub&s;tance, which, as we have &s;aid, forms a part of the bones of the &s;kull; and they even add, that during the four years that
<PB N="378" REF="430">
this bird was kept in the <HI>menagerie</HI> at Ver&s;ailles, they could not perceive that this &s;heath was ever detached. However, this might have happened through length of time, and by a kind of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive exfoliation, as in the bill of many birds; and this proce&s;s might have e&s;caped the ob&s;er|vation of the keepers of the <HI>menagerie.</HI></P>
<P>The iris is of a topaz-yellow, and the cornea is remarkably &s;mall, compared with the ball of the eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ball of the eye was one inch and a half in diameter; the cry&s;talline lens four lines, and the cornea only three lines. <BIBL><HI>Mem|pour &s;ervir a l'Hi&s;t. des Anim.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, which gives the animal a &s;trange wild appearance; the lower eye-lid is the large&s;t, and the upper is &s;et in the middle with a row of &s;mall black hairs, which form an arch over the eye like the brow, and this, together with the opening of the bill, produces a threatening a&s;pect. The exterior orifices of the no&s;trils are &s;eated very near the point of the upper bill.</P>
<P>In the bill we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the materials which &s;erve to cover it. They are three &s;olid pieces, two of which form the circumference, and the third con&s;titutes the upper ridge, which is much more elevated than in the O&s;trich; the three are &s;heathed with a membrane which &s;ills up the inter&s;tices.</P>
<P>The upper and lower mandibles of the bill have their edges a little furrowed near the end, and &s;eem each of them to have three points.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="431">
The head and the arch of the neck are &s;prinkled with a few &s;mall feathers, or rather with &s;ome black &s;traggling hairs; &s;o that on the&s;e parts the &s;kin appears bare. The colours and their di&s;po&s;itions are various; commonly blue on the &s;ides, violet under the throat, red behind in many parts, but e&s;pecially in the middle of the neck; and the&s;e red parts are more prominent than the re&s;t, on account of wrinkles, or oblique furrows.</P>
<P>The holes of the ears were very large in the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary de&s;cribed by the Academi|cians; very &s;mall in the one de&s;cribed by Clu|&s;ius; but in both they were di&s;clo&s;ed, and be&s;et like the eyelids with &s;mall black hairs.</P>
<P>Near the middle of the fore-part of the neck, and where the great feathers have their origin, ri&s;e two barbels which are red and blue, and round at the ends, and which Bontius places in his figure immediately above the bill, as in poul|try. Fri&s;ch delineates four; two long ones on the &s;ides of the neck, and two before that are &s;maller and &s;horter: the helmet al&s;o appears larger in his figure, and approaches the &s;hape of a turban. There is in the king's cabinet a head which &s;eems to be that of the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary, but which has a tubercle different from what is ordinary. It will require time and ob&s;ervation to a&s;certain whether the&s;e varieties, and tho&s;e which we &s;hall afterwards mention, be con&s;tant or not; if &s;ome of them be not
<PB N="380" REF="432">
owing to the inaccuracy of the de&s;igners, or are only &s;exual differences. Fri&s;ch pretend that he di&s;covered in two &s;tuffed Galeated Ca&s;&s;owaries, the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks between the males and females; but he does not inform us in what the&s;e con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The wings of the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary are &s;till &s;maller than tho&s;e of the O&s;trich, and equally unfit for flying. They are armed with points, and the&s;e are even more numerous than in the O&s;trich. Clu&s;ius found four or five of them; the Academicians five; and in Fri&s;ch's figure there are evidently &s;even: the&s;e are like the pipes of feathers, and appear red at the end, and are hollow through their whole extent. They contain within their cavity a &s;ort of marrow &s;imilar to what is found in the &s;prouting feathers of other birds. The middle one is near a foot in length, and about three lines in diameter, it being the longe&s;t of all: tho&s;e placed on either &s;ide dimini&s;h gradually like the fingers of the hand, and nearly in the &s;ame order. Swam|merdam u&s;ed them in&s;tead of a pipe to inflate very delicate ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch as the <HI>tracheae</HI> of in|&s;ects, &amp;c. It has been &s;aid, that the wings of the Ca&s;&s;owary were intended to accelerate its motion; others have conjectured that they only &s;erved them like &s;witches to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;trik|ing; but no one can a&s;&s;ert that he ever &s;aw what u&s;e the bird really makes of them. The Ca&s;|&s;owary has al&s;o another property common to

the O&s;trich, viz. it has but one kind of feathers over its whole body, wings, rump, &amp;c. though mo&s;t of the&s;e feathers are double, each root &s;ending off two branches of different lengths: nor is the &s;tructure uniform throughout; the branches being flat, black, and &s;hining, divided underneath into knots, each of which produces a beard or thread, with this difference, that from the root to the middle of the branch, the&s;e threads are &s;horter, more pliant, ramify more, and are covered with a kind of tawny down; whereas, from the middle of the &s;ame branch to its extremity, they are longer, harder, and of a black colour, and as the&s;e la&s;t cover the others, and are the only ones that appear, the Ca&s;&s;owary &s;een at a di&s;tance re&s;embles an animal clothed with hair, like bears or wild boars. The &s;horte&s;t feathers are on the neck, the longe&s;t round the rump, and the middle &s;ized on the intermediate &s;pace. Tho&s;e of the rump are fourteen inches long, and hanging over the hinder part of the body, they &s;upply the place of the tail, which is totally wanting.</P>
<P>It has, like the O&s;trich, a naked and callous &s;pace on the <HI>&s;ternum,</HI> where the weight of the body re&s;ts when the bird &s;its; and this part is &s;till more prominent in the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary than in the O&s;trich.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Voyages de la Compagnie Hollandoi&s;e.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The thighs and legs are clothed with feathers almo&s;t to the knees, and the&s;e feathers were of

an a&s;h-gray in the &s;ubject which Clu&s;ius ex|amined; the feet, which are thick and &s;tout, have three toes, and not four, as Bontius affirms; all of them directed forwards. The Dutch re|late, that the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary employs its feet for defence; &s;triking backwards like a hor&s;e, according to &s;ome; and according to others, dart|ing forwards again&s;t the a&s;&s;ailant, it throws him back with its feet, and &s;trikes his brea&s;t with vio|lent blows. Clu&s;ius, who &s;aw one alive in the gardens of Count Solms at the Hague, &s;ays, that it makes no u&s;e of its bill for protection, but that it attacks its antagoni&s;t &s;ideways, by kick|ing; he adds, that this Count &s;hewed him a tree about the thickne&s;s of his thigh which this bird had &s;poiled, having &s;tripped off the bark entirely with its feet and nails. The Ca&s;&s;owaries kept in the <HI>menagerie</HI> at Ver&s;ailles have not indeed been ob&s;erved to be &s;o &s;trong or &s;o mi&s;chievous, but perhaps they were grown tamer than that of Clu&s;ius: be&s;ides, they lived in abundance and in clo&s;er captivity; circum&s;tances which in time meliorate the di&s;po&s;itions of &s;uch animals as are not altogether wild, enervate their courage, blunt their original in&s;tincts, and render it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e from their acquired habits.</P>
<P>The claws of the Ca&s;&s;owary are very hard, black on the out&s;ide, and white on the in&s;ide. Linnaeus &s;ays, that they &s;trike with the middle claw, which is the large&s;t; yet the de&s;criptions and figures of the Academicians and of Bri&s;&s;on

<P>Its gait is &s;ingular; it appears to kick behind, at the &s;ame time it makes a kind of leap forwards. But however ungraceful its motion may be, it is &s;wifter, we are told, than the be&s;t runner: in|deed celerity of motion is &s;o peculiarly the pro|perty of birds, that the tardie&s;t of that tribe excel in the rapidity of their cour&s;e the mo&s;t agile of the land animals.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;&s;owary has the tongue indented along the edges, and &s;o &s;hort, that it has been &s;aid of it, as the moor cock, that it has none.

<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid they eject very &s;oon what they have taken, and &s;ometimes di&s;charge apples as

large as the hand, and in the &s;ame &s;tate in which they were &s;wallowed.

Clu&s;ius was a&s;&s;ured, that in the&s;e ca&s;es, they &s;ometimes ejected hen-eggs, which they are fond of, and quite entire with their &s;hell; but, on &s;wallowing them a &s;econd time, they completely dige&s;ted them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Clu&s;ius. <HI>Exotic.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The principal food of this bird, which was the Ca&s;|&s;owary belonging to Count Solms, was white bread cut into &s;mall bits, which proves that it is frugivorous, or rather omnivorous, &s;ince it really eats whatever is offered it, and has the craw and the double &s;tomach of the animals that live on vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, and at the &s;ame time it has the &s;hort inte&s;tines of &s;uch as feed on fle&s;h. The inte&s;tinal canal of the one diffected by the Academicians was four feet eight inches long, and two inches diameter through its whole ex|tent. The <HI>coecum</HI> was double, and only one line in diameter, and three, four, or five inches long. From this account it appears, that the inte&s;tines of the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary are thirteen times &s;horter than tho&s;e of the O&s;trich; and for this rea&s;on, it mu&s;t be &s;till more voracious, and &s;till more di&s;po&s;ed to animal food, which could be

<P>The Ca&s;&s;owary has a gall-bladder; and its duct, which cro&s;&s;es the hepatic, terminates higher than that in the <HI>duodenum,</HI> and the pancreatic duct is in&s;erted above the cy&s;tic; a conforma|tion of parts quite different from what obtains in the O&s;trich. The organs of generation in the male are not &s;o di&s;&s;imilar: the <HI>penis</HI> ri&s;es from the upper part of the <HI>rectum</HI>; its form is that of a triangular pyramid, two inches broad at the ba&s;e, and two lines at the <HI>apex</HI>; it con|&s;i&s;ts of two &s;olid cartilaginous ligaments, con|nected clo&s;ely to each other above, but parted below, and leaving between them a half-channel covered with &s;kin. The <HI>va&s;a deferentia</HI> and the ureters have no apparent communication with the perforation of the <HI>penis</HI>; &s;o that this part, which &s;eems to fill four principal offices in the quadrupeds, that of carrying off the urine, that of conveying the &s;eminal fluid to the fe|male womb, that of contributing by its &s;en&s;ibi|lity to the emi&s;&s;ion, that of &s;timulating the fe|male to melt in the embrace, &s;eems in the Ca&s;|&s;owary and the O&s;trich to be confined to the two la&s;t, which are calculated to excite in the two &s;exes the nece&s;&s;ary corre&s;pondence of mo|tion in the venereal act.</P>
<P>Clu&s;ius was informed that, when the animal is living, the <HI>penis</HI> &s;ometimes is ob&s;erved to

<P>The eggs are of an a&s;h-gray, verging on greeni&s;h, not &s;o thick, but longer than tho&s;e of the O&s;trich, &s;prinkled with a multitude of &s;mall tubercles of a deep green; the &s;hell is not very thick according to Clu&s;ius, who &s;aw &s;everal of them; the large&s;t of all tho&s;e which had fallen under his notice was fifteen inches round one way, and a little more than twelve the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Eggs with excavated points,</Q> is Linnaeus's expre&s;&s;ion, which is totally different from what Clu&s;ius a&s;&s;erts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;&s;owary has the lungs and the ten air cells as in other birds, particularly tho&s;e of the large kind; it has that &s;creen or black membrane peculiar to the eyes of birds, and that inner eye|lid, which, as it is well known, is attached to the large angle of the eye by two common mu&s;cles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. de l'Acad.

<P>The middle of the ea&s;tern part of A&s;ia &s;eems to be the true climate of the Ca&s;&s;owary, and its territory begins where that of the O&s;trich ends. The latter &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es beyond the Ganges, as we have already &s;een; but the former is found in the Molucca i&s;lands, and in tho&s;e of Banda, Java, Sumatra, and the corre&s;ponding tracts on
<PB N="387" REF="439">
the continent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Voyages des Hollandois.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is however far from being &s;o numerous as the O&s;trich, &s;ince a king of Joar|dam in the i&s;land of Java pre&s;ented Scellinger, the captain of a Dutch ve&s;&s;el, with a Ca&s;&s;owary as a rare bird. The rea&s;on probably is, becau&s;e the Ea&s;t Indies are much more populous than Africa; and it is well a&s;certained, that as men multiply, the wild animals gradually dimini&s;h, or retire into the more &s;olitary tracts.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, that the Ca&s;&s;owary, the O&s;trich, and the Touyou, which are the three large&s;t birds that are known, are all natives of the torrid zone, which they &s;eem to &s;hare among them&s;elves, each enjoying its own territory, without incroaching on that of another. They are really all of them land animals, incapable of flying, but running with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;wift|ne&s;s; all &s;wallowing whatever comes in their way, grain, gra&s;s, fle&s;h, bones, &s;tones, flints, iron, gla&s;s, &amp;c. In all, the neck is of great length, the legs tall and very &s;trong, the claws fewer than in mo&s;t birds, and in the O&s;trich, there are &s;till fewer than in the other two; in all, there is only one &s;ort of feathers, unlike tho&s;e of other birds and different in each of the three kinds; in all, the head and the arch of the neck are bare, the tail, properly &s;o called, is wanting, the wings are but imperfect, furni&s;hed with a few pipes, without any vanes, as the quadrupeds that in|habit
<PB N="388" REF="440">
the warm countries have le&s;s hair than tho&s;e of the regions of the north. All of them, in a word, &s;eem to be natural productions of the torrid zone. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e points of agreement, they are &s;till marked by charac|ters that di&s;tinctly &s;eparate the &s;pecies; the O&s;trich is removed from the Galeated Ca&s;&s;o|wary and the Touyou, by its &s;ize, by its feet, like tho&s;e of the camel, and by the nature of its plumage: it differs from the Ca&s;&s;owary par|ticularly by its naked thighs and flanks, by the length and capacity of its inte&s;tines, and be|cau&s;e it has no gall-bladder; and the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary differs from the Touyou and the O&s;trich, by its thighs being clothed with feathers, almo&s;t to the <HI>tar&s;us,</HI> by red barbils which hang from the neck, and al&s;o by the helmet on its head.</P>
<P>But in this la&s;t di&s;tinctive character we &s;till perceive an analogy with the other two kinds; for this helmet is nothing but a protuberance of the bones of the cranium, which is covered with a &s;heath of horn; and we have &s;een, in the hi&s;|tory of the O&s;trich and the Touyou, that the upper part of the cranium of the&s;e two ani|mals was &s;imilarly defended by a hard callous plate. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;pecific character of the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem is, that <Q REND="inline">it has three toes, with the helmet and barbils naked.</Q> Latham erects the Ca&s;&s;owary into a new genus, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the&s;e properties: the <HI>bill</HI> depre&s;&s;ed, &s;traight, and &s;omewhat conical; the no&s;trils oval; the <HI>wings</HI> very &s;hort, and un|adapted for flying; the lower part of the <HI>thighs</HI> naked; the <HI>feet</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of three toes, all of them turned forwards; the <HI>tail</HI> wanting.

<P>AGILITY is commonly conceived to be pecu|liarly the property of the winged tribe; but if we regard it as an e&s;&s;ential character, the Dodo mu&s;t be excluded from the cla&s;s; for its proportions and its movements give an idea of the mo&s;t heavy and awkward of organized be|ings. Figure to your&s;elf a body that is bulky, and almo&s;t cubical, &s;upported with difficulty on two exceedingly thick and &s;hort pillars, and car|rying a head &s;o &s;trangely &s;haped, that we might take it for the whim of a caricature painter; and this head, re&s;ting on a huge &s;welling neck, con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of an enormous beak, in which are &s;et two large black eyes encircled with a ring of white, and where the parting of the mandibles runs beyond the eyes, and almo&s;t quite to the ears; the&s;e two mandibles, concave in the middle, inflated at both ends, and bent backwards at the point, re&s;emble two &s;harp &s;poons laid on each other, their convexity being turned outwards: all which produces a &s;tupid
<PB N="391" REF="443">
voracious appearance, and which, to complete the deformity, is furni&s;hed with an edging of fea|thers, which, accompanying the curvature of the ba&s;e of the bill, &s;tretch to a point on the fore|head, and then arch round the face like a cowl, whence the bird has received the name of <HI>Capuchined Swan (Cygnus Cucullatus).</HI></P>
<P>Magnitude, which in animals implies &s;trength, produces nothing in this bird but oppre&s;&s;ive weight. The O&s;trich, the Touyou, and the Galeated Ca&s;&s;owary, indeed, are al&s;o incapable of flying, but they run with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;peed. The Dodo &s;eems to be clogged by its unwieldy carca&s;s, and can hardly collect force &s;ufficient to drag it along. It is the mo&s;t inactive of the fea|thered race. It con&s;i&s;ts, we might &s;ay, of brute pa&s;&s;ive matter, where the living organic particles are too &s;paringly di&s;&s;eminated. It has wings; but the&s;e are too &s;hort and too feeble to rai&s;e it from the ground. It has a tail, but it is di&s;pro|tioned, and out of place. We might take it for a tortoi&s;e di&s;gui&s;ed in the clothing of the winged tribe; and Nature, in be&s;towing the&s;e u&s;ele&s;s or|naments, &s;eems to have de&s;ired to add clum&s;ine&s;s to its unwieldy ma&s;s, and to render it more di&s;|gu&s;ting, by reminding us at the &s;ame time that it is a bird.</P>

<HI>Walgh-Vogel, Di&s;gu&s;ting Bird,</HI> both on account of its ugly figure, and the rank &s;mell. This &s;ingular bird is very large, and is only inferior in &s;ize to the three preceding; for it exceeds the turkey and the &s;wan.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on a&s;&s;igns as one of the characters, its having the lower part of the legs naked; yet in the 294th plate of Edwards it is repre&s;ented feathered, not only as low as the leg, but even to the articulation with the tar&s;us. The upper mandible is blacki&s;h throughout, except at the hook, where there is a red &s;pot; the holes of the no&s;trils are placed very near its middle, and clo&s;e to the two tran&s;ver&s;e folds, which ri&s;e at this part on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>The feathers of the Dodo are in general very &s;oft, and their predominating colour is gray, which is deeper on all the upper part of the body and the lower part of the legs, but brighter on the &s;tomach, the belly, and the whole of the under part of the body. There is &s;ome yellow and white on the quill-feathers of the wings, and tho&s;e of the tail, which appear frizzled, and are but few in number. Clu&s;ius reckons only four or five.</P>
<P>The feet and toes are yellow, and the nails black; each foot has four toes, three of which are placed before, and the fourth behind, and this hind one has the longe&s;t nail.</P>
<P>Some have pretended that there was com|monly lodged in the &s;tomach of the Dodo a
<PB N="393" REF="445">
&s;tone of the &s;ize of the hand, and to which they failed not to a&s;cribe the &s;ame origin and the &s;ame virtues as to the bezoars. But Clu&s;ius, who &s;aw two of the&s;e &s;tones of different &s;hapes, and bulky, is of opinion, that the bird had &s;wal|lowed them like the granivorous cla&s;s, and that they were not formed in its &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The Dodo is a native of the i&s;lands of France and Bourbon, and is probably found al&s;o on the neare&s;t parts of the continent, though I know of no traveller who mentions his &s;eeing it, except on the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Some Dutch call it <HI>Dodaers</HI>; and the Portu|gue&s;e and Engli&s;h, <HI>Dodo</HI>; however, it is named by the natives <HI>Dronte.</HI> It has al&s;o been called <HI>Hooded Dodo, Foreign Cock, Walgh-Vogel</HI>; and Maehring, who has found none of the&s;e names to his liking, has formed that of <HI>Ruphus,</HI> which Bri&s;&s;on has adopted for his Latin de&s;ignation, as if there was any advantage in giving the &s;ame animal a different appellation in each language, when the real effect of the multitude of &s;yno|nyms is to occa&s;ion embarra&s;&s;ment and confu|&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">Do not multiply exi&s;tences,</Q> was once the maxim of philo&s;ophers; but at pre&s;ent we have con&s;tantly rea&s;on to remind naturali&s;ts not to multiply names without nece&s;&s;ity. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus makes the Dodo generic, and to include three &s;pecies, viz.

di&s;tinct information. Queries alone, made with re&s;pect to facts with which we are unacquainted, have more than once led to a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The Solitary Dodo of the i&s;land of Rodrigue is a very large bird, &s;ince &s;ome males weigh forty-five pounds. The plumage of the&s;e is commonly mixed with gray and brown; but in the females, &s;ometimes brown, &s;ometimes a light yellow, predominates. Carr&eacute; &s;ays, that the co|lour of the plumage of the&s;e birds is glo&s;&s;y, bor|dering on yellow; he adds, that it is exceedingly beautiful.</P>
<P>The females have a protuberance over the bill re&s;embling a widow's peak; their feathers bunch out on both &s;ides of the brea&s;t into two white tufts, &s;omewhat like a woman's bo&s;om. The feathers of the thighs are rounded towards the end in the &s;hape of &s;hells, which has a very fine effect; and, as if the females were con&s;cious of their beauty, they take great pains in arranging their plumage, &s;moothing it with their bill, and adju&s;ting it almo&s;t continually, &s;o that not a &s;ingle feather is mi&s;placed. According to Le|guat, their whole appearance is noble and grace|ful; and this traveller even affirms that their plea&s;ing demeanour has often been the means of &s;aving their life. If this be the ca&s;e, and if the Solitary and the Dodo be of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies, we mu&s;t admit a very wide difference be|tween the male and the female in regard to their figure.</P>

This bird has &s;ome re&s;emblance to the tur|key; its legs differ only in being taller, and the bill in being more hooked; its neck is al&s;o pro|portionally longer, the eye black and lively, the head without a cre&s;t or tuft, and with &s;carcely any tail; its hind part, which is round like the buttocks of a hor&s;e, is covered with broad fea|thers.</P>
<P>The wings of the Solitary Dodo do not enable it to fly; but they are not u&s;ele&s;s in other re|&s;pects.

During the whole time of the incubation, and even that of the education, they &s;uffer no bird of the &s;ame kind to approach within two hundred paces; and it is pretended that the male drives away the males, and that the female drives away the females; an ob&s;ervation which could hardly be made on a bird that pa&s;&s;es its life in the wilde&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered &s;pots.</P>

<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, that whatever be their age, a &s;tone is always found in their gizzard, as in the Hooded Dodo: this &s;tone is as large as a hen's egg, flat on the one &s;ide and convex on the other, &s;omewhat rough, and &s;o hard as to be fit for a whet&s;tone. It is added, that it is always alone in the &s;tomach, and is too bulky to pa&s;s through the intermediate duct which forms the only communication between the craw and the giz|zard; and hence it is inferred, that this &s;tone is formed naturally in the gizzard of the Solitary, and in the &s;ame way as the bezoars. But for my part, I &s;hould only conclude that this bird is granivorous, and &s;wallows &s;tones and pebbles like all the re&s;t of that cla&s;s, particularly the O&s;trich, the Touyou, the Ca&s;&s;owary, the Hooded Dodo, and that the pa&s;&s;age between the craw and the gizzard admits of a greater dila|tation than Leguat &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>

only by the ties of dependence and want, its latent powers are never awakened and expand|ed. But it appears &s;till more timid than &s;avage; it even ventures to come nigh one, and with an air of familiarity, e&s;pecially if it has little ex|perience, and is not &s;cared by a &s;udden on&s;et; but it can never be tamed. It is difficult to en&s;nare it in the woods, where it can elude the &s;port&s;man by cunning and dexterity in con|cealing it&s;elf; but as it does not run fa&s;t, it is ea&s;ily caught in the plains and open fields; when overtaken, it utters not a complaint, but wa&s;tes its grief in tears, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;es every kind of food.

The Hooded Dodo inhabits the I&s;lands of Bour|bon and the I&s;le of France; the Hermit re&s;ided in the i&s;land of Rodrigue, when it was a mere wa&s;te, and has been &s;een in the I&s;land of Bourbon; the Bird of Nazare has been found in that i&s;land and in the I&s;le of France: but the&s;e four i&s;lands are contiguous to each other; and it is to be re|marked, that none of the birds has ever been di&s;|covered on the continent.</P>
<P>All the&s;e birds re&s;emble each other more or le&s;s in point of &s;ize, inability to fly, the form of their wings, of their tail, and their whole body; and in all of them, one or more &s;tones have been found in their gizzard, which implies that they are granivorous. In all of them, the gait is &s;low; for though Leguat does not mention that of the Hermit, we can ea&s;ily infer from the figure which he gives of the female, that it is a &s;luggi&s;h bird.</P>
<P>Finally, Comparing them two and two, we perceive that the plumage of the Hooded Dodo approaches that of the Hermit in its colour, and that of the Bird of Nazare, by its downy qua|lity; and that the&s;e two la&s;t agree al&s;o in only laying and hatching a &s;ingle egg.</P>
<P>Both the Dodo and the Bird of Nazare have been con&s;idered as having a di&s;gu&s;ting appearance.</P>
<P>Such are the re&s;emblances.&mdash;The differences are as follow:&mdash;</P>
<P>The Hermit has the feathers on its thighs rounded at the end like &s;hells; which proves
<PB N="403" REF="455">
that they are true feathers, &s;uch as tho&s;e of or|dinary birds, and not a kind of down, as is the ca&s;e with the Hooded Dodo and the Bird of Nazare.</P>
<P>The female Hermit has two white tufts of feathers on its brea&s;t; nothing &s;imilar is men|tioned in regard to the female of the two others.</P>
<P>In the Hooded Dodo, the feathers which bor|der the ba&s;e of the bill are di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;hape of a cowl; and the appearance is &s;o &s;triking, that it has given foundation for its characteri&s;tic name <HI>(Cycnus Cucullatus).</HI> Be&s;ides, the eyes are placed in the bill, which is no le&s;s remark|able; and we cannot doubt that Leguat &s;aw nothing like this in the Hermit, &s;ince he only mentions with regard to that bird, which he had viewed &s;o often, that there is neither cre&s;t nor tuft on its head; and Cauche, in &s;peaking of the Bird of Nazare, takes no notice of any thing of this kind.</P>
<P>The two la&s;t are tall; but the Hooded Dodo has very thick &s;hort legs.</P>
<P>The Hooded Dodo and the Hermit, who&s;e legs are &s;aid to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the turkey, have four toes, and the Bird of Nazare, according to Cauche, has only three.</P>
<P>The Hermit makes a remarkable beating with its wings, which has not been ob&s;erved in the others.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, It appears that the fle&s;h of the Her|mits, and e&s;pecially of the young ones, is ex|cellent;

that of the Bird of Nazare indifferent, and that of the Hooded Dodo, bad.</P>
<P>If this compari&s;on, which has been made with the greate&s;t accuracy, does not allow us to decide on the que&s;tion propo&s;ed, it is becau&s;e the&s;e ob&s;ervations are neither &s;ufficiently nu|merous nor certain.

Air.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;ervation of our ingenious author, that &s;ound is much more audible during the night than in the heat of the day, is curious and intere&s;ting; but the rea&s;on which he a&s;&s;igns for it, though &s;pecious, appears to be altogether inadequate to the effect. Air expands one-four-hundredth of its bulk for every de|gree of heat on Fahrenheit's &s;cale; and therefore, &s;up|po&s;ing the difference of temperature between the night and the day to be twenty degrees, which is a very large allowance, the variation of the air's den&s;ity would not exceed one-twentieth; a quantity too &s;mall &s;urely to be di&s;tinctly perceived. The atmo&s;phere often under|goes greater changes even in &s;erene weather; and an equal difference would take place in a&s;cending one thou&s;and four hundred feet from the &s;urface; yet in neither of the&s;e ca&s;es are we con&s;cious of any altera|tion in the force of &s;ound. Much undoubtedly mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the &s;tillne&s;s and ob&s;curity of the night, when the exerci&s;e of the other &s;en&s;es is in a manner &s;u&s;pended, and that of hearing engages almo&s;t the whole attention. During the meridian heats, al&s;o, various noi&s;es, the warble of birds, the hum of in&s;ects, and the chearing calls of rural labour, at once a&s;&s;ail the ear, and render that organ le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible to
<PB N="406" REF="460">
other impre&s;&s;ions. But there is another cau&s;e which &s;eems generally to have been over looked, though I am convinced that it contributes mo&s;t of all to the effect.</P>
<P>The vivacity of the intimation given by the &s;en&s;es depends not &s;o much upon the force of the impre&s;|&s;ion as upon its &s;implicity and di&s;tinctne&s;s. Hence, in high winds, &s;ound is heard at only a &s;hort di&s;tance, becau&s;e the a&euml;rial undulations are then di&s;turbed and confounded. In calm weather, too, when the &s;ky is clear, and the &s;un-beams act fiercely on the &s;urface of the earth, the heated air continually a&s;cends, and this inte&s;tine motion deranges the undulations in their horizontal progre&s;s. After the clo&s;e of the day, an equilibrium of temperature is again e&s;tabli&s;hed between the higher and lower &s;trata of the atmo&s;phere, which, during the tranquillity of the night, receives and propagates di&s;tinctly every impre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vol. I. Page 20. Line 8. [<HI>Specific Gravity of
Birds.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>THE lightne&s;s of the feathers and the hollowne&s;s of the bones of birds have generally been a&s;|&s;igned as the chief cau&s;es of the rapidity of their flight. And &s;ome naturali&s;ts, giving reins to their imagination, have alleged, that, as the cavities are filled with a &s;ort of inflammable gas, the&s;e animals are buoyed up in the atmo&s;phere like balloons. Such rea&s;onings are not &s;uperficial merely, they are ab&s;urd. The &s;pecific gravity of quadrupeds is hardly inferior to that of water, and therefore about nine hundred times greater than that of air; and admitting that in birds an equal quantity of matter occupies a triple &s;pace, which is &s;urely an ample conce&s;&s;ion, they would
<PB N="407" REF="461">
lo&s;e only the three-hundredth part of their weight at the &s;urface of the earth, and &s;till le&s;s in the &s;uperior regions of the atmo&s;phere. Will any per&s;on in&s;i&s;t on the efficacy of &s;o trifling a cau&s;e? Nay, the di|mini&s;hed gravity of birds, far from a&s;&s;i&s;ting their flight, produces the oppo&s;ite effect in a very high degree; for the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, the great impe|diment to their motion, is proportioned, when other circum&s;tances are alike, to the extent of &s;urface which they pre&s;ent. This ob&s;ervation is remarkably exemplified in the Bird of Paradi&s;e, which is clothed with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of feathers, that it cannot face the gentle&s;t gale, but is carried involuntarily into the &s;tream.</P>
<P>The ob&s;truction which birds encounter in their flight, is much more con&s;iderable than might at fir&s;t be apprehended: and this po&s;ition is evinced by a very obvious fact:&mdash;Mo&s;t &s;pecies fly apparently with equal ea&s;e, whether before or again&s;t a moderate wind, and therefore the &s;troke of the bla&s;t is greatly inferior to the ordinary re&s;i&s;tance experienced in their pa&s;&s;age through the air.</P>
<P>The rapid flight of birds re&s;ults wholly from the prodigious power exerted by their large pectoral mu&s;cles. This force may be re&s;olved into two por|tions; the one employed in &s;upporting the birds in the air, the other in impelling it through that re&s;i&s;ting medium. The former is con&s;tant, and proportioned to the ma&s;s; the latter depends on a variety of cir|cum&s;tances,&mdash;the quantity of &s;urface, the &s;hape, the velocity, and the den&s;ity of the &s;urrounding ele|ment. The relative proportion of the&s;e two forces mu&s;t therefore vary extremely. In very large birds, their cumbrous weight can hardly be borne up, while their quantity of &s;urface, which is comparatively &s;mall,
<PB N="408" REF="462">
occa&s;ions not any con&s;iderable ob&s;truction to their motion. It is thus that the O&s;trich &s;upports her body by means of her feet, and carries her&s;elf forward chiefly by the action of her wings. On the other hand, the &s;urface is &s;o great in proportion to the weight in very &s;mall birds, that almo&s;t their whole exertions are em|ployed in overcoming the re&s;i&s;tance of the air. If they intermit the &s;trokes of their wings, the motion they have acquired is quickly extingui&s;hed: thence the &s;udden deflections which di&s;tingui&s;h their flight. Of this, a remarkable in&s;tance is the Humming Bird, which, for its fluttering irregular progre&s;s, has been aptly compared to the humble-bee.</P>
<P>Nothing contributes &s;o much to facilitate the mo|tion of Birds through the air, as the acutene&s;s of the angle formed between their &s;houlders and their bill. For that rea&s;on, they extend their head, and endeavour to give their body as taper a &s;hape as po&s;&s;ible. Hence al&s;o, the birds which are mo&s;t remarkable for their fleetne&s;s, have generally long necks; &s;uch are mo&s;t of the &s;ea-&s;owl, which undoubtedly exerci&s;e their wings more than tho&s;e of the land.</P>
<P>The re&s;i&s;tance which a body &s;uffers in its pa&s;&s;age through a fluid is proportional to the &s;quare of the velocity. In &s;low motions, therefore, it is incon&s;i|derable, but accumulates mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hingly with an increa&s;e of celerity. Hence birds that differ widely in point of &s;trength, fly pretty nearly with the &s;ame rapidity; for it would require four times the force to give double the velocity, nine times to give the triple, and &s;o forth. We likewi&s;e &s;ee the rea&s;on why the dif|ference is not very great between the ordinary flight of a bird, and that wherein it exerts it&s;elf to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="463">
In &s;imilar ca&s;es the force nece&s;&s;ary to impel a bird through the air is proportioned to the den&s;ity of that medium. It will fly therefore with mo&s;t ea&s;e in the higher regions of the atmo&s;phere; but this advantage is modified, and often over-balanced, by another cir|cum&s;tance. The weight of the bird requires con|&s;tantly the &s;ame force to &s;upport it; and this force, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, can be produced only by the greater celerity of &s;troke; a condition which is not always compatible with the &s;tructure of the animal. This inconvenience will be chiefly felt by the larger &s;pecies of birds, which, for that rea&s;on, can never ri&s;e to any va&s;t height. The little tribes, on the contrary, are invited to &s;oar far beyond the region of the clouds, where they glide with wonderful facility. What alone &s;eems to &s;et bounds to their a&s;cent, is the cold which prevails at tho&s;e heights. And this influence is not &s;o great as might at fir&s;t be apprehended; for a &s;tream of rarefied air operates &s;lowly in robbing a body of its heat, and therefore gives a weak &s;en&s;ation of cold. It is extremely probable that &s;mall birds ri&s;e three or four miles into the air, where that fluid has only half the den&s;ity that obtains at the &s;urface. At that height the cold will indeed be &s;ixty degrees; but its effects will be equivalent to a cold of only thirty degrees at the &s;urface of the earth; which is le&s;s than the difference that often happens between the temperature of our &s;pring and that of our &s;ummer. The care of provid|ing food commonly detains them indeed near the &s;ur|face; but when they retire into other climates, they mount to the lofty regions of the atmo&s;phere, and pur&s;ue their arduous journey far beyond the reach of human &s;ight. No wonder then that the migrations of the &s;mall birds &s;hould have given occa&s;ion to &s;o
<PB N="410" REF="464">
much di&s;putation; while tho&s;e of the larger &s;pecies, &s;uch as the Goo&s;e, the Stork, and the Crane, have been univer&s;ally admitted.</P>
<P>As a bird in flying is actuated by two forces, the one impelling it upwards, the other forwards; the &s;troke of its wing mu&s;t be performed in an oblique direction, between the vertical and the horizontal; and it will be more inclined to the latter in proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of the bird, and the &s;wiftne&s;s of its motion. This is manife&s;t in the ca&s;e of Pigeons, which are &s;o noted for their rapid flight. The po&s;i|tion of the tail alone might indeed determine the di|rection of a bird's track; but that expedient would be attended with an expence of force which Nature has employed with &s;uch frugality. In &s;hort, it is ex|tremely probable, that from ob&s;erving the in&s;ertion of the wings, a phy&s;iologi&s;t could infer with tolerable ac|curacy, the u&s;ual rate at which a bird flies.</P>
<P>Birds often &s;eem to re&s;t &s;u&s;pended in the air; but the appearance is illu&s;ory, for the force required to &s;upport them is in every ca&s;e the &s;ame. Either they &s;uffer them|&s;elves to &s;ink gently on their expanded wings through a certain &s;pace, and then by a few lengthened &s;trokes, recover their former &s;tation; or they maintain their place by the nimble and vigorous quivering of their pinions, which is frequently di&s;cernible.</P>
<P>The tail of a bird has often been compared to the rudder of a &s;hip; but the analogy is incomplete; for the motion of a &s;hip is confined invariably to the &s;ame plane, while that of a bird is performed in every po&s;|&s;ible direction. The po&s;ition of the tail affects only the angle of a&s;cent or de&s;cent; it is the inclination of the head which turns the cour&s;e to the one &s;ide or the other.</P>

The remarkable hollowne&s;s of the bones, particu|larly tho&s;e of the wings, though it by no means con|tributes to the effect a&s;cribed to it in the text, is &s;ub|&s;ervient to &s;everal very u&s;eful purpo&s;es. It adds greatly to the &s;trength of the bones; and this prin|ciple &s;eems to have directed Nature in many of her animal and vegetable productions. Were the &s;talks, for in&s;tance, of tall &s;lender plants compacted into a &s;olid form, they would be unable to re&s;i&s;t the &s;malle&s;t violence. As the cavities of the bones in birds com|municate with the lungs, they mu&s;t con&s;pire to form and augment the voice. Analogy clearly leads to this conclu&s;ion, &s;ince the <HI>antrum,</HI> or &s;mall cavity near the bottom of the frontal bone, at the origin of the no&s;trils, is found by experience to a&s;&s;i&s;t the human voice. But the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential u&s;e of the hollowne&s;s of the bones is, perhaps, to afford an ample &s;urface for the in&s;ertion of the powerful mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>Feathers, like the fly in mechanics, &s;erve to equa|lize the motion of birds, but at a great expence of force. Their principal u&s;e, however, is certainly to confine the animal warmth which is generated, or ra|ther evolved, by the proce&s;s of re&s;piration. Loo&s;e &s;pungy &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as cotton, hair, wool, and particularly feathers, are &s;low conductors of heat, and therefore admirably calculated for the purpo&s;e of clothing. The wa&s;te of vital heat on the &s;urface of the body is occa&s;ioned by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive contact of air, and proportioned to the quickne&s;s of the applica|tion. It is hence that a &s;trong wind will, even in temperate weather, affect us with &s;en&s;ations of cold, though we often feel very comfortable during hard fro&s;t, when the air is &s;till. Birds therefore, more than any other animals, mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to this wa&s;te of
<PB N="412" REF="466">
heat; and accordingly they are clothed with a thicker and richer garb. We may al&s;o remark, that &s;mall birds are for their &s;ize better feathered than large ones, as the &s;urface which they expo&s;e to the cooling &s;tream of air is proportionally greater. It is thus that Nature kindly &s;uits her provi&s;ions to the wants of her creatures. Man alone is &s;ent into the world naked and helple&s;s, and perpetually urged by his nece&s;&s;ities to the exerci&s;e and cultivation of his faculties. This view of the utility of phy&s;ical evil is finely illu&s;trated by the elegant Virgil.</P>
