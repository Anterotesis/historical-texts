<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SO many different opinions having of late
been offered to the public concerning
the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent advanced price of
provi&s;ions, &s;ome attributing it to the engro&s;&s;|ing
and monopolizing of land, others to
luxury, others again to regraters and fore|&s;tallers;
I cannot forbear giving my &s;enti|ments
on the&s;e &s;ubjects, as I think the dif|ferent
arguments I have met with are by
no means &s;atisfactory; but &s;uch as, in
many in&s;tances, may tend to mi&s;lead my
countrymen, and inflame the imaginations
of that cla&s;s, who, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, often
become riotous, and dangerous to a &s;tate.
When this is the ca&s;e, it is &s;urely incum|bent
on every one who thinks he has it in
his power, to &s;et &s;uch authors right where
it may appear they have been mi&s;informed;
I &s;hall therefore not &s;cruple, though unac|cu&s;tomed
to the pre&s;s, to refute the&s;e argu|ments
<PB REF="3">
in the manner which my profe&s;&s;ion en|ables
me to do. Accordingly, I &s;hall in the
following &s;heets endeavour to point out the
real cau&s;es of &s;carcity, and at the &s;ame time
offer &s;uch remedies as appear to me capa|ble
of producing the de&s;ired effect; I
mean regular and moderate prices of
provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the article of mono|polizing
land, as that &s;eems to be the
mo&s;t general topic of the pre&s;ent times.
The evil tendency of this has been at|tempted
to be explained by &s;everal writers,
who&s;e plau&s;ible arguments may mi&s;lead
tho&s;e who are not conver&s;ant in the na|ture
and management of different &s;oils,
and who therefore give credit to every
ab&s;urdity; for if the &s;ubject &s;avours of
compa&s;&s;ion, it is popular, and carries con|viction,
though it is not under&s;tood.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. ON MONOPOLIZING LAND.</HEAD>
<P>TO proceed with all po&s;&s;ible candor
in my inve&s;tigation of this &s;ubject,
I &s;hall enumerate the many evils which are
&s;aid to ari&s;e from the monopolizing of land,
whereby it is &s;uppo&s;ed the pre&s;ent &s;carcity
is artificially produced. A cool examina|tion
of facts will probably &s;hew us, whether
this practice bears any, and what &s;hare in
the calamity we complain of.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">
It is &s;aid, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That large farmers, by
growing opulent, become negligent of their
bu&s;ine&s;s; that they, con&s;equently, do not
cultivate their lands to &s;o much advantage
as they might, and that by this means their
produce is le&s;s than that of an equal pro|portion
of land in the hands of many &s;mall
farmers, who, with their families, did the
chief of the work them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That large farmers, being opu|lent,
are not under the nece&s;&s;ity of bringing
their corn to market, but retain it, to the
great di&s;tre&s;s of the poor.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That our markets are not &s;o
well &s;upplied with pigs, poultry, butter,
and eggs, as when there were &s;mall far|mers,
who&s;e wives attended the markets
with tho&s;e articles, which rendered the
price of butcher's meat cheap.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That large farms are the occa|&s;ion
of depopulation, whereby the num|ber
of labourers is &s;o much dimini&s;hed,
that, in &s;ome places, there are &s;carcely
hands &s;ufficient to till the ground; con&s;e|quently,
that the cropping of the land is
neglected, and the harve&s;t badly got in;
both which mu&s;t dimini&s;h the quantity,
and enhance the price of corn.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="3" REF="8">
<HEAD>SECTION I. The national benefit of proper &s;ized farms.</HEAD>
<P>IN an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the foregoing
objections again&s;t large farms, I &s;hall
&s;et out with laying down a principle in
which I am confident all parties will agree;
it is, that the produce of the earth, whe|ther
in tin, lead, iron, corn, or wool, is the
riches of our nation; and therefore, that
however tho&s;e articles may be obtained, it
is the quantity that is the only national
object. Farther, that whatever the article
is, the &s;urplus of what is wanted will be
locally a drug in real value or e&s;timation,
till converted to its proper u&s;e; if lead or
iron, it will be &s;old to purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries;
if corn, we &s;hall con&s;ume what is nece&s;&s;ary
for our &s;upport, and the &s;urplus will be
&s;old for other commodities which we may
require: at all events, it is the quantity
to be produced which the nation &s;hould
attend to. This being granted, it remains
to prove by what means the greate&s;t quan|tity
is to be produced.</P>
<P>The advocates for &s;mall farms will &s;ay,
By the indu&s;try which is &s;o con&s;picuous
among &s;mall farmers, who, being obliged
to &s;truggle for their livelihood, can neither
<PB N="4" REF="9">
commit wa&s;te, nor be guilty of neglect. I
&s;ay, that it is by the indu&s;try of tho&s;e who,
being ea&s;y in their circum&s;tances, can at|tend
their bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;pirit and chear|fulne&s;s,
and who, by daily ta&s;ting the
&s;weets of their labours, are encouraged to
redouble their activity. But let us con&s;ult
facts, and &s;ee which argument they will
be&s;t &s;upport.</P>
<P>It has pretty generally been laid down
as a maxim, by the gentlemen I allude to,
that farms of one hundred acres are the
proper &s;ize<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. Author of Political Speculations, and others.</NOTE>. This they &s;ay without &s;pe|cifying
the kind of &s;oil; a circum&s;tance,
&s;urely, &s;omewhat material to be known.
However, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t them in that point,
which I am enabled to do, by finding
others, or perhaps the &s;ame under another
&s;ignature, talk of 50 <HI>l.</HI> a year.&mdash;We will
therefore &s;uppo&s;e the land at 10 <HI>s.</HI> an acre;
and as we mu&s;t take the average price of
England, I will call it good loam; and to
a&s;&s;i&s;t their argument, I will tell them what
are the nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ites for &s;uch a farm.
Fir&s;t, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the
farmer &s;hould have in ready ca&s;h at lea&s;t
500 <HI>l.</HI>&mdash;When I mention this &s;um, I am
<PB N="5" REF="10">
far within bounds: had he more, he and
his country would reap the benefit of it.
I &s;hall not enter into the minute detail of
every in&s;trument to be purcha&s;ed, and every
operation nece&s;&s;ary to be done, but only
chalk out the great outlines of the oeco|nomy
nece&s;&s;ary on &s;uch a farm.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t keep at lea&s;t 4 hor&s;es; 5 would
be better, but almo&s;t too much for his capi|tal.
He mu&s;t keep

<ITEM>1 Ploughman,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Boy,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Thre&s;her,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Maid,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Odd man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Now, without entering into the manage|ment
of his farm, or con&s;idering whether
he is a good or a bad farmer; I mean to
prove, from the above circum&s;tances, that
three hundred acres of &s;uch land in the
hands of one man, will produce more,
and con&s;equently that &s;uch a &s;ized farm,
con&s;idered in a national view, is more bene|ficial.
I &s;hall not be thought unrea&s;onable
in alloting my farmer on the three hun|dred
acres, a proportionate &s;um of money,
cattle, and &s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11">
Thus he will have 1500 <HI>l.</HI> in money,
<LIST>
<ITEM>12 Hor&s;es,</ITEM>
<ITEM>9 Men,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Boys,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Maids, or the labour of three women.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Previous to what I am now going to &s;ay,
I mu&s;t mention &s;ome facts which are nece&s;|&s;ary
by way of explanation to &s;ome of my
readers, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are operations on
this, and indeed almo&s;t every kind of &s;oil,
which, at different times, require different
&s;trength of hor&s;es: for example, &s;ometimes
&s;ix hor&s;es will be required in one plough,
to break up a piece of ground for fallow;
thus, in this in&s;tance, the farmer of three
hundred acres will have two ploughs at
work, when the little farmer cannot have
one, but mu&s;t wait till it is perhaps too
late to recover his &s;ea&s;on; or at lea&s;t he
will have lo&s;t all the benefit of the roa&s;ting
weather, which is to make his fallow. On
the other hand, there are many operations
in fallowing, and in feed-time, when three-hor&s;e
ploughs are &s;ufficient; in which ca&s;e
the farm of three hundred acres will have
four three-hor&s;e ploughs at work when the
other can have but one. To this &s;ome will
&s;ay, why not in the one in&s;tance hire, and
in the other work with two-hor&s;e ploughs,
in which ca&s;e they would be equal, as in
<PB N="7" REF="12">
part of York&s;hire, Norfolk, E&s;&s;ex, &amp;c.
I an&s;wer, that at the one time, perhaps,
his neighbours are equally bu&s;y with him|&s;elf;
and as to the latter, I will agree
there are times when two-hor&s;e ploughs
are u&s;eful: but if hor&s;es go abrea&s;t when
there is any moi&s;ture in this &s;ort of land,
the damage done by their trampling the
&s;urface of the ground, will not be recovered
in a twelvemonth. If what I have &s;aid
be truth, it is as evident, that the farmer
of three hundred acres, with a proportionate
capital and number of hor&s;es, is able to do
more than his proportion of work in the
&s;ame time; and the doing of it at the cri|tical
juncture, is of &s;o much the greater
con&s;equence; thus his ground is naturally
in better tilth, his fallows, &s;eed-time, dung|cart,
in &s;hort, every operation performed
better, becau&s;e they can be di&s;patched;
and his ground being in better order, it will
not be denied but that his produce mu&s;t be
greater. There is al&s;o an advantage in the
proportion of &s;ervants, which will not &s;o
ea&s;ily be under&s;tood but by practical men;
for it is natural to &s;ay, As one is to four, &s;o
are three to twelve: but this will not hold
good in practice; for, in harve&s;t-time, and
many other operations which require that
kind of di&s;patch, by throwing many hands
together, the work is better and more ex|peditiou&s;ly
<PB N="8" REF="13">
done: for example, in harve&s;t;
two drivers, two loaders, two pitchers, two
rakers, and the re&s;t at the rick, or in the
barn, will di&s;patch double the work that
the &s;ame number of hands would do, if divi|ded
into different gangs on different farms.
How&s;oever unintelligible this matter may
appear to &s;ome, it is fact. But the circum|&s;tance
of the great farmer's employing an
equal number of men may be denied; in
an&s;wer to which I can only &s;ay, that daily
ob&s;ervation proves it, and &s;hall add more|over,
that reapers will flock to him, when
the little farmer is not able to get a hand:
the rea&s;on is evident, namely, that labourers
will always prefer that ma&s;ter who is mo&s;t
likely to employ them longe&s;t, that they
may not lo&s;e time in &s;hifting. But as I
mean to confute by facts, and not by argu|ments,
I will appeal to the farmer, whe|ther
what I advance is true or not.</P>
<P>The great farmer will al&s;o have a con|&s;iderable
advantage in re&s;pect to his carts
and waggons; for he will not require above
two waggons and four carts, whereas each
of the little ones is obliged to have one
waggon and two carts; thus there will be
a &s;aving of the expence of one waggon
and two carts on an equal &s;pot of ground;
which &s;urplus may be expended in &s;tock
<PB N="9" REF="14">
or labour: the &s;ame will hold good with
regard to harrows, rollers, and many other
implements.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a national advantage
attending this farm, which cannot be on
the &s;mall one; I mean, the keeping of
live &s;tock; oxen, or &s;heep, or both. It
may be a&s;ked, Why? and whether an
equal number of cattle may not be kept
on the three &s;mall farms? The rea&s;ons
why they cannot are many: The pur|cha&s;ing
of &s;tock, and providing artificial
food for them, not only requires capital,
but the re&s;olution of a man in an exten&s;ive
bu&s;ine&s;s: for though 500<HI>l.</HI> are the pro|portion
for one hundred acres, yet &s;up|po&s;ing
a part laid by for &s;uch purpo&s;es,
I will &s;ay 50<HI>l.</HI> out of each 500<HI>l.</HI> my argu|ment
is, that 150<HI>l.</HI> in the hands of one
man, will encourage him to do more than
50<HI>l.</HI> in tho&s;e of the other. For the truth
of this I will appeal to the feelings of
farmers, or indeed of men on the Royal
Exchange. However, there is a yet more
&s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on; which is, that the little
farmer cannot do it with &s;o much profit;
for &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould have a flock of one
hundred &s;heep, which is a great many for
&s;uch a farm, that flock will not maintain
a &s;hepherd, though it requires as much
<PB N="10" REF="15">
care and attendance as triple the number,
which would be very ea&s;ily tended by one
man; nor is it &s;ufficient to make a bene|ficial
fold: even if there is a common, the
&s;mall farmer will not reap an equal advan|tage
with the larger; for his &s;heep mu&s;t
&s;traggle by them&s;elves, and the &s;hepherd
who attends the large flock will always
take care to have the be&s;t feed, while the
others are drove among bu&s;hes and furzes
to &s;eek a mi&s;erable livelihood; lo&s;ing per|haps
half their wool before &s;heering time;
and thus they become of le&s;s benefit, either
to the owners or to the nation. With
oxen, it is nearly the &s;ame: there mu&s;t
be artificial food provided for them, which
is rarely &s;een on &s;mall farms; nor indeed
will the little farmer ea&s;ily be induced to
go into &s;uch a culture: his capital is too
&s;mall, and he tru&s;ts to his corn to pay his
rent, though the benefit of the dung of
the&s;e cattle would be very con&s;iderable.
This is one of the great advantages which
attends the farmer who at the &s;ame time is
the grazier; and who is of &s;o much more
value to his country, as he can, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of artificial pa&s;ture, bring cattle
to market at a cheaper rate than when fed
on old pa&s;tures and hay; with the addi|tional
benefit to the nation, of employing
more hands in procuring that food for the
<PB N="11" REF="16">
cattle, though they can be brought to mar|ket
cheaper, and will be of cour&s;e when
the practice becomes more general.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e arguments, I hear
&s;ome &s;ay, that corn can be rai&s;ed cheape&s;t by
the &s;mall farmer, becau&s;e the chief of the
labour is executed by him&s;elf and his fa|mily,
whereas the labour on the great farm
is done by others, who&s;e wages mu&s;t be
paid out of the profits. Tho&s;e who argue
thus are little acquainted with hu&s;bandry
affairs; for it will appear upon inquiry,
that there neither is or can be one &s;ervant
le&s;s kept on the three &s;mall farms, than
there are on the three hundred acres in the
hands of one man. However indu&s;trious
the &s;mall farmer may be, it does not exempt
him from keeping one &s;ingle &s;ervant the
le&s;s; he mu&s;t have, as I &s;aid before,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Ploughman,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Boy,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Thre&s;her,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Odd-man,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Maid.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If his &s;ons and daughters are grown up,
and able to do the bu&s;ine&s;s of the farm,
they &s;eldom remain at home; and if they
do, they are not maintained for &s;o little as
hired &s;ervants: but we will &s;uppo&s;e that
matter equal. I only mean to prove, that
<PB N="12" REF="17">
the farmer cannot rely on his own labour;
and if he does, I will maintain that he
is a lo&s;er by it. His employment &s;hould
be, a general attention to the whole: his
thre&s;her mu&s;t be watched, or he will &s;oon
lo&s;e his wages in corn not thre&s;hed out;
his mowers, reapers, &amp;c. mu&s;t be looked
after; he mu&s;t con&s;tantly go round his
&s;ences; he mu&s;t &s;ee there is no neglect;
which would be the ca&s;e if he was con|fined
to any one &s;pot: if he chances to
have a few &s;heep, they will require as
much attendance as a larger flock; yet he
cannot afford to keep a &s;hepherd: thus
there are three men employed to look after
three hundred acres, which would be at
lea&s;t as well managed by one man on his
hor&s;e. To this it will be &s;aid, No; the
great farmer growing opulent, becomes
negligent, and of cour&s;e, his ground is
not &s;o well managed, and his produce is
con&s;equently le&s;s. This is a contradiction
in terms; for if he grows opulent, in
what manner did he acquire his riches,
but by having a greater return for his
capital, and thereby being able to lay up
&s;omething annually, which the &s;mall far|mer
&s;eldom or ever has it in his power to do,
unle&s;s indeed by a very uncommonly &s;pi|rited
hu&s;bandry. There cannot be a clearer
proof that a certain tract in the hands of
<PB N="13" REF="18">
one man produces more than in the hands
of many: for was it otherwi&s;e, and that
he was carrying on a lo&s;ing trade, it is a
known fact, that the greater his undertak|ing,
the &s;ooner he would be ruined: but
on the other hand, if there is ever &s;o &s;mall
an annual &s;aving, that will &s;oon accumu|late;
and I will venture to &s;ay, that the
man who finds he is carrying on a pro|fitable
bu&s;ine&s;s, will attend it with infi|nitely
more &s;pirit, than the poor dejected
wretch, who is always labouring again&s;t
the &s;tream.</P>
<P>But this calculation of the comparative
advantage of labour on the great and &s;mall
farms, only regards the common bu&s;ine&s;s
of a farmer, without taking in the &s;everal
great works of marling, land-draining, &amp;c.
by which &s;uch con&s;iderable improvements
have been made, but which there is rarely,
if ever, an in&s;tance of on &s;mall farms, for
want of a &s;ufficient capital for &s;uch an under|taking;
and when I mention this advan|tage,
let it be remembered that I con&s;i|der
it as a national one, as I cannot admit
a di&s;tinction between the profit of the far|mer
and that of the nation, each depend|ing
&s;o intimately on the other.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="14" REF="19">
<HEAD>SECTION II. That the large farmers retaining their corn;
under the pre&s;ent laws, is beneficial to the
nation.</HEAD>
<P>THE general outcry which has been
made again&s;t the great farmer, for
keeping his corn from market, has not failed
to inflame the minds of almo&s;t all ranks of
people. The arguments made u&s;e of have
been plau&s;ible, and could not but have
weight with tho&s;e among us who are neither
acquainted with hu&s;bandry, the nature of
markets, nor the corn laws. It is the lan|guage
of men compa&s;&s;ionating the mi&s;erable
&s;tate of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Poor, and con&s;e|quently
one of tho&s;e popular topics which
mu&s;t affect the religious good man. But
when we come coolly to examine the &s;tate
of our hu&s;bandry, markets, and corn laws,
and who are the pre&s;ent purcha&s;ers of corn,
we &s;hall perhaps find, that it is a mo&s;t
happy circum&s;tance for this nation, that
there are a &s;ett of wealthy farmers who
have it in their power to retain a part of
their growth in tho&s;e natural and be&s;t of
granaries, their ricks. Was it otherwi&s;e, as
the corn laws now &s;tand, we might often,
<PB N="15" REF="20">
even with a mo&s;t plentiful harve&s;t, be in the
utmo&s;t danger of famine.</P>
<P>The argument made u&s;e of is, that the
little farmer is, through nece&s;&s;ity, obliged
to thre&s;h out his corn and bring it to market;
but that the opulent man will not produce
his, until it comes to a certain price. The
fir&s;t fact I will allow; for true it is, that the
little farmer is obliged to bring his corn to
market before Chri&s;tmas, to enable him to
pay his rent; and therefore it is at that
time that corn is cheape&s;t: but what is the
con&s;equence? Their little portion is &s;oon
gone, and you have no reliance but on the
ricks of the great farmer to afford you a
regular &s;upply. Had their corn likewi&s;e
been thre&s;hed out and brought to market,
what would have been the con&s;equence? the
Poor could not have con&s;umed it; but it
would have been cheap, and &s;o cheap, that
Bear-Key, which is e&s;teemed the barometer
of our produce, would have pronounced
corn plenty this year, at a time, when, I
am confident, England had the greate&s;t
rea&s;on to dread a &s;carcity; and, in this ca&s;e,
your corn might have been exported, per|haps
with a bounty, without a po&s;&s;ibility of
receiving a &s;ingle grain back again. What
would then have become of your Poor at
Mid&s;ummer? This is a real fact, and lucky
<PB N="16" REF="21">
it is for us at pre&s;ent, that either the great
farmers wilfully retain, or by &s;ome other
circum&s;tances have it not in their power to
&s;end corn to market in &s;uch quantities as
would gratify the &s;pleen of ignorant, di&s;|contented
people: for my own part, I am
apt to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome have not in their
power to do it: for I will confe&s;s that there
is in &s;ome in&s;tances an evil attending great
farms, which is, where landlords, when
they lay many &s;mall farms together, de&s;troy
barns to avoid the expence of repairs. Thus
the want of thre&s;hing-floors, added to the
bad yield of the crop, may, in &s;ome places,
prevent the great farmer's &s;ending to market
what he would otherwi&s;e do. Some there
may be, who greedy of gain, may wait a
higher market; but they as often out&s;tand
it. Wheat is now near 15<HI>l.</HI> per load: do not
imagine that farmers in general are not con|tent
with &s;uch a price. The fair trader in
London would be &s;atisfied with &s;uch a profit:
yet there are &s;cheming &s;peculators who ruin
them&s;elves and their neighbours. So it is
with farmers. They are men like your|&s;elves;
and let them &s;tand on the &s;ame
ground, for their occupation is full as
honourable, and infinitely more beneficial
to a nation. In plentiful years they mu&s;t
&s;ell cheap: let them then, when they have
&s;canty crops, have a price equal to the lo&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="22">
in their quantity; treat them as you would
be done by, and cea&s;e &s;uch illiberal abu&s;es
again&s;t men who de&s;erve every encourage|ment,
and who &s;hould be con&s;idered by a
wi&s;e nation as it's bulwark and the &s;ource
of it's riches. Let the&s;e declaimers point
me out a number of merchants, who, at
the approach of a war, when a heavy in|crea&s;e
of taxes is to be laid on the Poor,
would not monopolize hemp, though the
enhancing its price to government mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
add to the weight already laid on
the Poor? How few are there who will not
engro&s;s a commodity nece&s;&s;ary for the ma|nufacturer,
and thereby render the national
advantage of exporting his labours abor|tive,
by rai&s;ing the price &s;o that we cannot
fell upon an equal footing with our neigh|bours?
How very few are there, who, in
the greate&s;t dearth at home, will not export
our beef and corn, if they can do it to ad|vantage?
But if the farmer retains his corn
but a day, applications are made to parlia|ment,
to force it if po&s;&s;ible out of his barn.
Let the&s;e declaimers, among whom there
are many who, to get money, will think
no &s;cheme too wild, turn their hands to the
plough, and &s;ee what plenty they will pro|duce
to their families. They will, I &s;u&s;pect,
though too late, di&s;cover that more inge|nuity
is requi&s;ite in that, than in fabricating
<PB N="18" REF="23">
a bill upon the Royal-Exchange, and that
clo&s;e attention and hard labour are the price
of the comforts which the farmer enjoys.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the different &s;upply of markets from large
or &s;mall farms, in regard to pigs, poultry,
butter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER national evil which has
been pointed out as proceeding from
the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom of monopolizing land,
is the want of that &s;upply of pigs, poultry,
butter, and eggs, with which markets were
&s;o well &s;tocked by little farmers, and which
greatly tended to lower the price of other
provi&s;ions. In an&s;wer to the two fir&s;t of
the&s;e articles, I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, that
they are not objects worthy the attention of
the legi&s;lature; for few will conceive that
dainties &s;hould be brought to market to
reduce the average price of provi&s;ions: but
was it otherwi&s;e, I will &s;ay, that no &s;mall
farmer can rai&s;e pigs and fowls in the &s;ame
di&s;trict at &s;o low a price as butcher's meat,
<PB N="19" REF="24">
no more than he can afford to &s;ell veal and
lamb at the &s;ame price as beef and mutton;
and therefore, e&s;pecially, when provi&s;ions
are dear, it is better that &s;uch delicacies be
kept from market, and that what they co&s;t
in cramming, be expended in rearing up
live &s;tock.</P>
<P>But as &s;ome may differ with me in
opinion, I &s;hall inform &s;uch, that it is not
the little farmer who can rear either to ad|vantage.
If he is a &s;uckler, not one drop
of milk can be &s;pared to the &s;ow which is
to fatten her pigs, and if he has only one
cow for the u&s;e of his family, the milk will
be more advantageou&s;ly con&s;umed among
them than in his &s;tye: farther, unle&s;s he
has con&s;tant thre&s;hing going on, that the
pigs and poultry may always have to pick
up the corn which is left in the &s;traw thrown
out at the barn door, he will find that they
will want the many handfuls of corn thrown
to them, which are never taken account of,
and not mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they are taken from
the great heap, but which, if mea&s;ured out
to the good hou&s;ewife, who&s;e perqui&s;ite
they are, would &s;tartle her at the end of
the year. So thoroughly is a neighbour of
mine &s;atisfied of the truth of this, that he
is determined never to rear another pig;
convinced that he can buy &s;tore pigs to put
<PB N="20" REF="25">
up for fattening, cheaper than he can rear
them; being well a&s;&s;ured that they do not
co&s;t him le&s;s than 8<HI>d.</HI> per pound before they
are put up: much le&s;s will he be able to
&s;ell a &s;ucking pig at the price of butcher's
meat. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the
fattening of &s;uckling animals, know the
truth of what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>It is only the cottager and large farmer
who can rear them to advantage; the fir&s;t,
by letting a &s;ow with her litter of pigs run
in the lanes, or rather, under that pretence,
in the fields and meadows of the neigh|bouring
farmers. Yet this cannot be deemed
a national benefit. The only per&s;on who
can rear pigs to real advantage, is the far|mer
who &s;ows fields of clover purpo&s;ely for
their u&s;e, (but this mu&s;t be at a di&s;tance
from large towns, where hay does not fetch
an extraordinary price) or the dairy-man
who makes butter and chee&s;e. The&s;e are
likewi&s;e the only people who can &s;upply us
with butter at a rea&s;onable rate, and that by
dint of capital and clo&s;e attention to that
one article: nor are the&s;e men &s;eated on
what are called arable farms.</P>
<P>Here I will inform my opponents of a
practice they are probably not acquainted
with, which is, that in Denbigh&s;hire and
<PB N="21" REF="26">
Flint&s;hire, it is no uncommon thing to &s;ee
hundreds of pigs, for which they grow
clover on purpo&s;e, and which graze on the
gra&s;s lands adjoining the beach, and when
the tide is out, they go down and feed on
the &s;ea ooze, where they find &s;hell-fi&s;h, &amp;c.
The&s;e pigs are as regularly folded at night
as &s;heep. They are bought up by the di&s;|tillers,
&amp;c. By this means pigs, or what
is more proper for the farm, pork, is reared
to mo&s;t advantage. The per&s;on from whom
I had this information, and who has been
long a dealer in hogs, a&s;&s;ures me of this fact;
and that it is not uncommon to &s;ee five
thou&s;and in one market; and he confirmed
to me what I have advanced, that it is the
great farmer only who can rear them to
advantage, and that by this practice.</P>
<P>As to eggs, they may indeed, at particu|lar
times of the year, have been brought to
market by the &s;mall farmer: the &s;ame may
al&s;o be done by the cottager's wife, not
that it is &s;uch a &s;upply as will an&s;wer the
purpo&s;e. It is the quantity which comes
from Scotland, and other cheap countries,
that can affect the market.</P>
<P>With regard to fowls, it is a known fact
that it is the great farmers who chiefly
<PB N="22" REF="27">
&s;upply markets with them; for they only
can do it to advantage.</P>
<P>One Shallcroft, who had a farm of 400
acres, and who lately died worth 10,000<HI>l.</HI>
&s;upplied Croydon market with fowls; and
what is remarkable is, that it is chiefly the
great farmers who have &s;upplied that
market with poultry and butter for many
years pa&s;t, and their wives have attended
that market as regularly as the farmers did
the corn market. That of butter cannot
be doubted; and the other is as evident to
tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in the
matter. The thre&s;hing-floor of the great
farmer is always open, and it is the corn
thrown out in the &s;traw that fattens the
barn-door fowl; whereas the little farmer,
who&s;e thre&s;hing-floor is not con&s;tantly em|ployed,
mu&s;t at times feed them, and the
wife, who&s;e perqui&s;ite they are, will not let
them &s;tarve while there is a grain of corn
in the heap. If this is the ca&s;e at Croydon,
which is &s;o near London, and from whence
&s;o much &s;traw is carried to &s;upport the
London market with all this grain in it,
which would be picked out of the &s;traw by
pigs and fowls; how &s;trong a proof is it,
that the markets, at a di&s;tance from great
towns, mu&s;t be more ea&s;ily &s;upplied with
<PB N="23" REF="28">
fowls in the neighbourhood of large farms,
than where they are all &s;mall ones?</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to have given a
place to the&s;e an&s;wers; but the lo&s;s of pigs,
poultry, butter, and eggs, has been &s;o ge|neral
a topic in all companies, and in every
pamphlet which has appeared, that, in&s;ig|nificant
as the &s;ubject is, I could not avoid
expo&s;ing the fallacy of the arguments
made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let me now, in my turn, a&s;k, Who is
it that &s;upplies our markets with beef and
mutton? It is the great and opulent
farmer. Who is it that furni&s;hes the Poor
with chee&s;e, and &s;uch butter as they ought
to eat, good potted Cambridge butter? It
is the great dairy men.&mdash;But among the
various lamentable complaints with which
we have been pe&s;tered, I have not heard a
&s;yllable of the want of veal or lamb; No!
there is plenty of them. Let the&s;e de|claimers,
if they really feel, as they pretend
to do, for the Poor, blu&s;h at the &s;ight of
it on their table. This is one of the real
cau&s;es of the high price of meat. When a
calf or a lamb can be made to fetch as
much at three months old, as they would
be worth when a &s;teer or wether at two
years old in the ordinary method of feed|ing
<PB N="24" REF="29">
&s;tock, this may &s;ometimes become a
real evil; but not the want of other lux|uries
of the &s;ame kind.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Of population, as affected by large or &s;mall
farms.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t charge again&s;t the great far|mer,
or, as he is called, the mono|polizer
of land, is depopulation. The
ab&s;urdity of the a&s;&s;ertion has often amazed
me: but what makes, it more ridiculous,
is, that the &s;ame writer who tells us there
is apprehen&s;ion of famine, laments that
there are not more mouths to eat the little
we have. When indeed I con&s;ider that the
quickne&s;s of the conveyance in po&s;t-chai&s;es
has induced many gentlemen to travel for
their amu&s;ement, who, quitting London,
where perhaps they were bred in a crowd,
are &s;truck with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at
the va&s;t &s;ize of Sali&s;bury Plain, without a
hou&s;e in view, and wonder how agricul|ture
is carried on upon the Dor&s;et&s;hire
Downs by &s;ome &s;cattered &s;hepherds with
their flocks, or in the grazing countries,
where they &s;ee nothing but fat oxen and
a few &s;cattered hou&s;es, I am not &s;urprized
that the country has made &s;uch an impre&s;|&s;ion
on them: but were they to vi&s;it the
<PB N="25" REF="30">
manufacturing towns which border on tho&s;e
tracts, they would perhaps return with far
different ideas. To the&s;e, I &s;hould not
think it worth the while to give any an|&s;wer:
but when I hear gentlemen who
pretend to &s;ome knowledge in agriculture
a&s;&s;ert, that the holding large tracts of arable
land is the cau&s;e of depopulation, I can no
longer be &s;ilent. I have, indeed, fre|quently
intended to give my opinion on
this very intere&s;ting &s;ubject, and am now
the more particularly induced &s;o to do, as
I mean to avail my&s;elf of the very argu|ments
made u&s;e of in a pamphlet lately
publi&s;hed, under the title of, <HI>Uniting and
monopolizing Farms plainly proved di&s;ad|vantageous
to the Land-owner, and highly
prejudicial to the public;</HI> &s;o perfectly do
they agree with tho&s;e I had before laid
down to enforce the very contrary opi|nion.</P>
<P>The writer of that pamphlet &s;uppo&s;es,
as I would, a tract of land of eight hun|dred
acres, or 400<HI>l. per ann.</HI> in the occu|pation
of one man, and a like quantity in
the occupation of eight men. The only
circum&s;tance in which I &s;hall differ from
him in his calculation is the number of
&s;ervants in general, and the proportion of
them that are kept in the hou&s;e: My e&s;ti|mate
<PB N="26" REF="31">
will be from my own knowledge,
corroborated by the intelligence I have
picked up on that &s;ubject in the different
counties through which I have pa&s;&s;ed.
But as the alteration I &s;hall make in the
number and di&s;tribution of the &s;ervants
will rather make for this author's argu|ment,
he certainly can have no objection
to it.</P>
<P>He &s;ets out with &s;aying, that if the tract
is in the hands of one man, his family
will con&s;i&s;t of him&s;elf, a wife, three chil|dren,
twelve &s;ervants, and ten labourers,
each with a wife and three children; in
all fifty.

<P>Then, on each of the eight &s;mall farms,
he &s;uppo&s;es the farmer, his wife, and three
children, and two &s;ervants, that is, &s;even
in each family; and that each farm &s;hould
have a labourer, with five per&s;ons in each
labourer's family. In this ca&s;e, the num|ber
of per&s;ons depending on the&s;e lands
thus divided into eight &s;eparate farms will
&s;tand thus;

<P>I have taken this mode of calculating the
inhabitants from the Author's own plan:
but allowing the &s;even &s;upernumerary mar|ried
men to be &s;ingle, and deducting for
their wives and children 28, there would
remain 114, among whom there would be
20 married men in&s;tead of only 16 on the
8 &s;mall farms. Had this Author &s;tated the
fact otherwi&s;e, and made the compari&s;on on
pa&s;ture land, I &s;hould have agreed with
him: but on arable land, nothing is more
contrary to the fact than what he lays down.
Now we have each of us told our tale, and
the fact only mu&s;t determine who is right.
At all events, I would advi&s;e gentlemen to
make very &s;trict inquiry into the truth of
the matter before they &s;uffer them&s;elves to
be led away by every publication that ap|pears.
I will acknowledge, that there is a
management of land which may tend to
dimini&s;h the number of people in that par|ticular
pari&s;h where it is practi&s;ed; it is
indeed what rarely happens in old farms,
<PB N="31" REF="36">
but it may be an attendant on &s;ome of the
new-inclo&s;ed common-field land, where,
perhaps at the in&s;tigation of the landlord,
too great a proportion is laid down to gra&s;s.
A &s;en&s;ible tenant will be glad to meet with
old meadow; but few, I believe, will court
new pa&s;tures, &s;ince the introduction of
clovers, &amp;c. I will likewi&s;e &s;ay, that there
are circum&s;tances when it may be prudent
for both tenant and landlord. For example;
&s;uppo&s;e common-field land on a moory &s;oil,
be&s;t adapted to pa&s;ture land, and which
with good management will, in a very few
years, become equal to the be&s;t: or &s;uppo&s;e
chalky land, excellently well adapted to
&s;ainfoin, but by the barbarous cu&s;tom of
common-field tenure, rendered almo&s;t u&s;e|le&s;s
to the tenant. Are tho&s;e tenants who
&s;en&s;ibly pay higher rent for &s;uch land when
inclo&s;ed, to be precluded the liberty of con|verting
it to what it ought to be, merely to
gratify the whim of a few theoretical
farmers; or &s;hould the nation be deprived
of the increa&s;ed produce, by its not being
put under proper culture? and yet, if this
is done to a great extent, it mu&s;t dimini&s;h
the labour, and con&s;equently drive away
&s;ome of the inhabitants. But where do
the&s;e gentlemen-writers think they are gone
to? Perhaps to other &s;pots, which once
were poor &s;tinted commons, but now are
<PB N="32" REF="37">
covered with &s;heaves of corn, in&s;tead of the
few &s;tarved &s;heep which were maintained
there in the &s;ummer, for the winter food of
crows and ravens. It is indeed certain,
that large tracts of pa&s;ture land mu&s;t keep a
di&s;trict thin of inhabitants: it could not well
be otherwi&s;e, when, as formerly, gra&s;s and
hay were the only method of fattening
bullocks: nor was that a branch which u&s;ed
to be carried on by the little or middling
farmer: it was done by people of capi|tal;
and to turn it to the mo&s;t advantage,
or indeed to employ their capital, large
tracts of land were nece&s;&s;ary. It is, and
mu&s;t continue to be, the &s;ame in breeding
countries; and on the downs, where our
flocks are bred, large tracts are requi&s;ite for
a &s;heep-walk. Be&s;t maiden down will not
carry above two &s;heep per acre to fold,
without clover or good meadow to bait
them on: but let it not be imagined that
this is wa&s;te; the&s;e little animals doubly
earn their value before they come to market,
by their fleeces, and by the many adjoin|ing
acres which they manure; and on this
account it is, that in the&s;e and &s;uch-like
&s;pots, large farms are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary:
and the advantage of a large fold is
&s;o well known, that in parts of Wilt&s;hire
where there are &s;mall farms which have but
&s;mall flocks, it is a common practice to
<PB N="33" REF="38">
throw them into one fold, each man having
them for as many nights as are equal to the
proportion of his flock: nor indeed do I
know any tract of country where exce&s;&s;ive
large farms, &s;uch as have been alluded to,
prevail, but in downy countries, where
&s;heep-walk is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and where often
many acres are rented for a few &s;hillings,
Norfolk and Effex farms excepted: but in
Norfolk I hope our author will not &s;ay the
country has been depopulated by large
farms, for by the &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited cul|ture
of the inhabitants of that country,
nobly in&s;pired by Lord Town&s;hend, who
quitted the office of Secretary of State to
become the u&s;eful hu&s;bandman, they have
converted a barren &s;and into the mo&s;t fertile
&s;pot in England. View their fields of tur|nips,
barley, clover, wheat, and &s;hew me
&s;uch management in a country inhabited by
little farmers. But how have they done it?
by indu&s;try, and a &s;en&s;ible attention to their
bu&s;ine&s;s; by the landlords &s;en&s;ibly dividing
the country among opulent men, who, by
dint of capital, were able to cover their &s;oil
with clay or marle at the expence of the
then fee-&s;imple of the land, and not by
becoming indolent, becau&s;e they grew opu|lent:
and I will &s;ay, that it redounds much to
the honour of tho&s;e landed proprietors, that
they &s;uffered the &s;ons to enjoy the fruits of
<PB N="34" REF="39">
the labours of their fathers: not but that
their rents are now properly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>This leads me nece&s;&s;arily to hint at an|other
ob&s;ervation of the author I allude to,
who &s;eems to lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s on the
national advantage of increa&s;ed rents, and
of the old method of calculating the profits
of the farmer by the three rents. In the
infancy of agriculture, it was a con&s;cien|tious
and equal partition of property; &s;uch
as is now practi&s;ed in the le&s;s enlightened
parts of the world; in mo&s;t parts of France,
Germany, and in &s;ome of our American
colonies: the one finds land and capital,
the other knowledge and labour: but on a
well-cultivated and good &s;oil, the rent is
now the lea&s;t object: it is the &s;um which a
man can &s;ink in &s;tock, and in the annual
expence of his labour, on which he is to
reckon the intere&s;t of his money, or income.
&mdash;The &s;ubject has already led me beyond
the intended limits of this Chapter: but in
an&s;wering the author of the above-quoted
Pamphlet, on the topic of depopulation, I
was naturally led to point out &s;ome other
circum&s;tances in large farms, in which he
&s;eemed to be equally mi&s;informed.</P>
<P>Let it not, however, be thought that I
am &s;o ab&s;urd as to propo&s;e that all England
<PB N="35" REF="40">
&s;hould be divided into large, or indeed any
particular-&s;ized farms. I have only endea|voured
to refute the ab&s;urd doctrine of tho&s;e
who maintain that large farms have brought
on a ruin to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ion and that the only
remedy is to divide the land into &s;mall
farms. I &s;ay that there &s;hould be, as there
are now, farms of all &s;izes, to &s;uit the dif|ferent
capitals of the people who engage in
farming. If &s;uch writers as I am &s;peaking
of were at all conver&s;ant in hu&s;bandry, they
would know, as I have already explained,
that the proportion of land, which is in
&s;ome degree governed by its value, &s;hould
be equal to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> capital; and if they
were acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ words"> nature of the mo&s;t
valuable trade of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ion, they would con|&s;ider
agriculture in this country to be the
fir&s;t object of commerce, and therefore they
would &s;ee that it is as ab&s;urd to confine a
farmer with 10,000<HI>l.</HI> to one hundred acres,
as to place a man with 500<HI>l.</HI> on one thou|&s;and
acres. To &s;ay that a man, who, by
indu&s;try, has increa&s;ed his capital in farm|ing,
&s;hall cea&s;e to be a farmer, is as great a
contradiction to common &s;en&s;e; for &s;uch
prohibition it would be, not to permit a
man to employ his capital in the bu&s;ine&s;s he
has been brought up to and under&s;tands.
Whatever may be the opinion of the&s;e gen|tlemen,
I will maintain, that the produce
<PB N="36" REF="41">
of the earth is the only wealth of a
nation: if corn is our natural produce,
corn &s;hould be our trade, as gold is that of
Peru; and perhaps it is the only trade that
cannot be over-done: we do not want in|&s;tances
to prove, that artificial trade is often
extended to the ruin of a nation: that
cannot be the ca&s;e with the produce of the
earth: manufactures have a limited con|&s;umption;
be&s;ides which, that nation which
will not wear your cloth, will eat your
corn. Let this manufacture then go on in its
u&s;ual cour&s;e: it is in the hands of men who
under&s;tand it better than you do, and, be|lieve
me, their own intere&s;t will tell them
what is mo&s;t proper to be done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. On Jobbers, Fore&s;tallers, and Regrators.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many who have a&s;&s;igned
cau&s;es for the pre&s;ent advanced price
of provi&s;ions, there are a &s;et of men who
do not attribute the &s;carcity to either of the
aforementioned cau&s;es, nor do they confine
their compa&s;&s;ion to the Poor only, but ex|tend
their pity even to the farmer. Their
complaints are poured out again&s;t jobbers,
fore&s;tallers, and regrators; though I am
confident that many of them do not under|&s;tand
<PB N="37" REF="42">
the particular occupation of either of
the&s;e, but confound the whole in one ma&s;s.
I confe&s;s that there are many in&s;tances in
the &s;ale of cattle at Smithfield, which mu&s;t
confirm the&s;e people in their opinion: a
very recent and remarkable one happened
on the 16th of November la&s;t, when oxen &s;old
at 2 <HI>d.</HI> per pound; and yet there was no
vi&s;ible alteration in the price of butcher's
meat. This would naturally induce them
to believe that there is plenty, but that it is
withheld by art. It mu&s;t, likewi&s;e, be ob|&s;erved,
that &s;heep were dearer that very
day, than had been known for &s;ome time
pa&s;t. However, as tales are told imper|fectly,
and too often that part of them only
which makes for an argument, I am not
&s;urprized that well-di&s;po&s;ed men are fre|quently
mi&s;led. I &s;hall not &s;ay but that
there may be, and is, craft in that bu&s;ine&s;s, as
there mu&s;t be in every other where the lea&s;t
re&s;triction will always give the attentive
artful man an advantage over his neighbour:
at the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be conceived, that
there is in this, as in all other articles, a
fluctuation in the price: nor will it be diffi|cult
to explain that this fluctuation mu&s;t
operate by greater &s;trides in live cattle, than
in any commodity which can be depo&s;ited
in magazines. All that the wi&s;dom of
legi&s;lature can do, or ought to attempt, is,
<PB N="38" REF="43">
to let tho&s;e &s;treams of plenty flow from
their &s;ource in their natural channel; for
the dam that occa&s;ions &s;till-water above, is
&s;ure to create a torrent below, which carries
every thing before it.</P>
<P>To inve&s;tigate the truth of what is here
advanced, I &s;hall explain the natural cau&s;es
of this fluctuation in the price of live cattle:
this will account for the &s;udden fall of beef
on the day abovementioned, and prove that
it neither could have, nor ought to have,
any great effect on the price of butcher's
meat: I &s;hall then proceed to point out the
channel in which the &s;upply of live cattle
u&s;ed to flow, till it met with a check,
which, I believe, has given &s;ome foundation
for a part of the complaints we have heard.
In doing this, I &s;hall de&s;cribe the different
occupation of each man concerned in this
traffick; and from thence it will appear,
that the aboli&s;hing of either mu&s;t eternally
produce the evil complained of.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I &s;hall inform the Reader,
that the fluctuation in the price of live &s;tock
does, and ever mu&s;t, depend on the quan|tity
there is of the different &s;orts of food
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport tho&s;e cattle in their dif|ferent
&s;tages of age and degree of fatne&s;s.
For example; if after-pa&s;ture, fodder and
<PB N="39" REF="44">
turnips fail, lean &s;tock mu&s;t be cheap, be|cau&s;e
there will not be purcha&s;ers for them
at the fairs; and fat bea&s;ts will, for the
&s;ame rea&s;on, keep their price, becau&s;e the
grazier knows it will turn to better account
for him to be&s;tow the food he has upon the
&s;tock which is nearly fit for market, than
to divide it among many, which would
keep the forward ones too back; nor would
it bring the lean &s;tock forward enough to
make off in the &s;pring with any moderate
degree of profit. Thus he will con&s;ume
the whole with his fattening bea&s;ts, by
which means there will not be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to &s;upply the market, and tho&s;e bea&s;ts
which would have come in the &s;pring, mu&s;t
be kept lean, to another year. This cir|cum&s;tance,
and the &s;carcity of food, which
will not allow him to have &s;o great a &s;tock
to employ his capital in, mu&s;t naturally,
and ought to give him a greater profit on
the few he has. Thus will the cour&s;e of
market generally be governed; and I believe
it was as generally expected that what I
have related would have been the ca&s;e this
year; for there was in the &s;ummer little
appearance of gra&s;s, fodder was evidently
&s;carce, and cabbages and turnips had failed
almo&s;t every where: but a mo&s;t providen|tially
fine autumn furni&s;hed the E&s;&s;ex and
Kenti&s;h men with &s;uch abundance of after|pa&s;ture,
<PB N="40" REF="45">
that they gave great prices for all
cattle that were forward enough to be
brought on. This naturally induced them
to make off all their &s;tock on hand that was
fit, or nearly fit, for market, in order that
their new &s;tock might have &s;ufficient plenty
to pu&s;h them on before the winter &s;et in,
when they could be able to fini&s;h them on
oil-cake, &amp;c. To this I impute the great
and unexpected glut that there was at
Smithfield on the Monday alluded to; and
what &s;trengthens me in my opinion is, that it
was immediately after King&s;ton-Fair, where
a great number of Welch bea&s;ts were bought
up by the E&s;&s;ex and Kenti&s;h farmers. The
pre&s;ent high price of hay and oil-cakes
might indeed have operated in &s;ome degree,
by inducing many graziers to &s;end up &s;uch
of their bea&s;ts as were fit for market, rather
than keep them back for the regular &s;upply:
but as it is not natural to &s;uppo&s;e that this
la&s;t rea&s;on &s;hould have operated with all on
the &s;ame day, I cannot but think my &s;ug|ge&s;tion
right; and what confirms me in it
is, that &s;heep were dearer that very day
than they had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t.
This la&s;t circum&s;tance is one rea&s;on why this
extraordinary fall in beef &s;hould not have
had an immediate effect on the price of
butcher's meat: for it is the average of the
profits which mu&s;t govern the butcher in his
<PB N="41" REF="46">
&s;ale. But &s;uppo&s;ing mutton had been equally
cheap, no butcher in London would have
purcha&s;ed more than was nece&s;&s;ary for the
demand of his u&s;ual cu&s;tomers: he could
neither keep his bea&s;ts nor his &s;heep alive;
and if he &s;laughtered them, he ran the ri&s;k of
having a great part remain to &s;poil on his
hands. Thus the overplus of what was
wanted for the u&s;ual con&s;umption, would be
naturally bought up by tho&s;e who had an op|portunity
of keeping them on; and was it not
for &s;uch men, from whence &s;hould we now
expect a regular &s;upply, till tho&s;e bea&s;ts are
brought forward, which are not yet fit for
market? Let it not, however, be imagined
that all their dealings are attended with
&s;uch profit; they have &s;evere blows, as well
as men in other trades: it is the average
profit of the whole year on which they
count their gain; and however it may be
the fa&s;hion to &s;tigmati&s;e the&s;e dealers with
odious appellations, it is on them alone that
we can depend for a regular &s;upply. Yet,
whil&s;t I am thus &s;peaking in favour of the&s;e
dealers, I will confe&s;s that I believe there
are among them &s;ome who, as the laws
have lately been enforced, have given too
great foundation for the clamours of the
people; I mean, when the &s;ale&s;man is the
dealer. I know that precautions have been
taken to guard again&s;t this inconvenience,
<PB N="42" REF="47">
by prohibiting them from holding farms:
but it is ea&s;y to conceive that &s;uch a law
may be evaded: and I know that it is; and
though it be a crime to act in violation of
the laws, yet that crime is greatly le&s;&s;ened,
if the enactors of the laws lay temptations
in the way, to induce people to act in op|po&s;ition
thereto: and this they have done,
by aboli&s;hing what were called Jobbers;
the evil con&s;equences of which I &s;hall pro|ceed
to explain.</P>
<P>When there were tho&s;e traders in cattle
called Jobbers, Smithfield market was con|&s;tantly
and well &s;upplied. They were
people who had no fixed re&s;idence, but tra|velled
the country in &s;earch of &s;uch cattle
as were fit for market; and having no land
in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as they had
bought a lot of &s;heep, or oxen, they im|mediately
di&s;patched them to Smithfield|market,
where they were con&s;equently
obliged to be &s;old. If &s;everal of the&s;e hap|pened
to meet at the &s;ame market, which
was frequently the ca&s;e, of cour&s;e their
cattle were &s;old cheap; but they were con|tented
with their chance profit; and &s;et out
immediately on another journey. If the
cattle were ever &s;o cheap, the butchers could
not buy more than for their u&s;ual con|&s;umption.
This nece&s;&s;arily called in a &s;et
<PB N="43" REF="48">
of men who had land within a moderate
di&s;tance of the metropolis, and thereby had
an opportunity of keeping them on, to
&s;upply the market regularly. The&s;e men
naturally &s;hould have their profit: but that
could not, in general, be great, as they
were always liable to have great quantities
poured in unexpectedly by the jobbers,
who&s;e motions were never known, and al|ways
uncertain. Thus were the markets
always fully &s;tocked; the grazier got rid of
his cattle, at his door, without trouble or
expence; and the butcher was always &s;ure
of finding a market well &s;upplied by the
jobber, or the intermediate man who had
always by him a &s;tock that had been pur|cha&s;ed
when the markets were glutted.
This was a regular channel of trade, which
went on uninterrupted: whereas, when the
jobbers were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the grazier was
obliged either to &s;end up his cattle him&s;elf,
or to commit them to the care of a &s;ale&s;man,
who, of cour&s;e, became his advi&s;er when
to &s;end his &s;tock to market; and by this
means, being intimately acquainted with
the demand and the &s;upply, it is natural to
believe that &s;elf-intere&s;t, which governs us
all, would induce him to become a purcha&s;er,
who had it &s;o much in his power to &s;upply
the butchers as he thought proper, and who,
by the &s;ame knowledge, had it as much in
his power to purcha&s;e his cattle at what
<PB N="44" REF="49">
price he plea&s;ed to &s;et on them: for it re|quired
but the combination of a few, to
order up the grazier's cattle whenever they
wi&s;hed to make a purcha&s;e. In this manner
has the profit of the latter decrea&s;ed &s;o
much, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome
of them to attend Smithfield them&s;elves,
though, when they came there, they could
only look on; not having it in their power
to &s;ell to a butcher, who was perhaps as
much in the clutches of the &s;ale&s;man as
him&s;elf. By this means we have lo&s;t that
intermediate man, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to all parties,
and by this means we have created a real
fore&s;taller. I will not charge all with being
guilty of this practice: there are hone&s;t
men, as well as knaves, in every profe&s;&s;ion.
I have only endeavoured to point out the
manner in which this may operate; and I
am confident that it will, whenever there is
the &s;malle&s;t re&s;triction or interference of
legi&s;lature in any trade; for, as Sir Wil|liam
Mildmay ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, a general
liberty granted to rai&s;e our nece&s;&s;ary pro|vi&s;ions,
will procure us a general plenty for
&s;ale; a general indulgence allowed to this
&s;ale, will reduce them to a general cheap|ne&s;s,
&amp;c. Happy am I to think we have a
Mini&s;ter, who&s;e wi&s;dom has induced him to
li&s;ten to &s;uch men as can give him real in|formation
on a &s;ubject he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed
to be intimately acquainted with him&s;elf!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. On Luxury, as affecting Provi&s;ions and
Population.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many writers who have
favoured us with their productions on
the &s;ubject of Provi&s;ions and Population,
there are none who fail to attribute it, in
part or the whole, to Luxury. I &s;hall not
attempt to &s;ay that Luxury has not an
effect on the price of all commodities;
among others, on provi&s;ions: but how far
it is prejudicial or beneficial to a &s;tate, is
matter of &s;erious con&s;ideration, and &s;hould
be handled with infinite delicacy whenever
the &s;ubject is taken up by the Legi&s;lature.
It is a known fact, that, in an infant-&s;tate,
Luxury is a child which &s;hould be nou|ri&s;hed
to &s;uch a degree as to procure the
conveniencies and comforts of life; for on
that depends the improvement of agricul|ture,
arts, manufactures, and commerce.
It is as certain a fact, that Luxury is an
attendant on wealth, and that, when it is
not accompanied with vice, it is a benefit
to a nation. By this it is that wealth be|comes
more equally diffu&s;ed among all
ranks of people: it encourages the manu|facturer
and artificer; and if it is confined
to the table of the rich man, agriculture
reaps the benefit of it, without any public
<PB N="46" REF="51">
detriment: in &s;hort, in every in&s;tance, the
poor receive their &s;hare of this &s;cattered
wealth; and in proportion to the luxury
of the &s;pot, the poor who inhabit are, by
the diffu&s;ed riches, enabled to bear their
&s;hare in the price of provi&s;ions. In proof
of what I &s;ay, draw the compari&s;on between
the labouring poor of the city of London
and its neighbourhood, with tho&s;e of Wales
and other remote countries. I do not &s;peak
of the worthle&s;s abandoned poor: they
always flock to large cities, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by
charity and theft, where they are not &s;o
ea&s;ily detected as in the country. This
leads me to point out a &s;pecies of luxury
which I have never heard arraigned, but
which, I am confident, does much mi&s;|chief,
though proceeding from a laudable
motive: I mean, that unbounded charity
which, when kept within limits, and ad|mini&s;tred
with prudence, is the noble cha|racteri&s;tic
of the Engli&s;h nation; but which
I have known, in many in&s;tances, to do
much hurt, and encourage idlene&s;s, in&s;tead
of rewarding indu&s;try. I &s;ay, this evil pro|ceeds
from luxury, becau&s;e I fear an o&s;ten|tatious
vanity is frequently the motive for
many whimfical donations.</P>
<P>Why Luxury &s;hould be an attendant on
wealth is obvious; it is, becaufe money be|comes
cheap: but in &s;uch proportion all
<PB N="47" REF="52">
commodities ri&s;e in value. In 1307, when
the intere&s;t of money was 45 <HI>per cent.</HI> all
provi&s;ions were what we &s;hould now call
cheap. In 1604, when the intere&s;t of mo|ney
was 9<HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s. per cent.</HI> provi&s;ions ro&s;e
in proportion; and &s;o on to this day, mak|ing
proper allowance for the different cir|cum&s;tances
which attended this country
when divided by civil wars, or harra&s;&s;ed by
foreign enemies. But as luxury is the
con&s;tant attendant on wealth, it mu&s;t natu|rally
affect provi&s;ions in a greater propor|tion;
for it will create wa&s;te; it induces
people of fortune to keep a great number
of dome&s;tic &s;ervants, who are fed on dain|ties,
in&s;tead of the coar&s;e but whole&s;ome
food they were before accu&s;tomed to; it
increa&s;es the number of hor&s;es which are
kept for plea&s;ure; both which mu&s;t con&s;i|derably
increa&s;e the con&s;umption of meat
and corn. It likewi&s;e certainly affects pro|vi&s;ions,
by the de&s;truction of the number|le&s;s
calves and lambs that are &s;laughtered
for the London market, which mu&s;t rai&s;e
the price of beef and mutton, as they
con&s;ume in three months the amount in
value of food which would rear them, to
two years old. This is, indeed, an encou|ragement
to agriculture, and, as I &s;aid
before, di&s;per&s;es the wealth among all ranks
and denominations of people, while the
<PB N="48" REF="53">
taxes on luxury properly fall upon the rich,
and the land is &s;o far relieved of a part of
that burthen which mu&s;t be chearfully
borne for the &s;upport of a great and power|ful
nation, I mean that part of the taxes
which, lights on the con&s;umer, which is all
exci&s;eable commodities. It will here be
&s;aid, that the wa&s;te on the rich man's table,
and the corn con&s;umed by his hor&s;es, would
feed many hungry mouths. I allow it:&mdash;
but the evil points out a remedy; for if it
is the real fact, as I believe it to be, that
the con&s;umption is greater than the pro|duce,
cultivate more land, and &s;uffer not
barren acres to &s;tare us in the face when
we are crying out for bread.</P>
<P>There is yet another &s;pecies of Luxury,
which is in con&s;equence of wealth; it is, that
the inhabitants of the country naturally flock
to great cities, where they can enjoy the more
refined amu&s;ements of a poli&s;hed nation.
The conveniency of trade indeed brings
thither the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part; the
nece&s;&s;ary calling together of the Legi&s;la|ture
brings another part; and the attach|ment
to courts and other amu&s;ements,
brings the third. The&s;e nece&s;&s;arily carry
with them a &s;uite of attendants, which I
cannot but think mi&s;chievous to a &s;tate;
for the loitering life of a gentleman's &s;er|vant
not only debauches his own mind,
<PB N="49" REF="54">
but, by his attendance on the great, and
his intercour&s;e with the inferior cla&s;s,
makes him the vehicle of conveyance of
tho&s;e manners which ruin the indu&s;trious
trade&s;man, though nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;h|ments
in the rich. If they unfortunately
&s;ee a bad example, they retail it out with
all its mi&s;chievous con&s;equences; and in
this manner does their appearance and ex|ample
operate when they return with their
ma&s;ters to the country. They there de|bauch
the minds of the ru&s;tic labourers,
who envy their fine cloaths and lazy life;
and by this means too many of the inferior
cla&s;s are drawn to towns, where, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, they do not continue to be &s;uch
u&s;eful members in point of population, as
if they had remained in the country; for
by all the calculations that have appeared,
the lives of children in towns bear no pro|portion
with tho&s;e born and bred up in the
country. This nece&s;&s;ary evil, which at|tends
all great cities, is the natural and
inevitable con&s;equence of wealth. Let us
not, however, &s;ee things in &s;o gloomy a
light, as to think the&s;e people entirely lo&s;t
to &s;ociety, or even to that part which de|pends
on agriculture. What I am going
to relate is matter of fact within my own
knowledge; namely, that in hay and har|ve&s;t
time, when labourers are wanted in
<PB N="50" REF="55">
the country, it is inconceivable what num|bers
of trade&s;men and handicrafts flock into
the country, and as con&s;iderable is the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance we receive from them at the only
time they are wanted there. Thus they
become doubly beneficial to the nation.
The fact is as I &s;ay, but their motives may
be two-fold; the one, that they have not
employment at that time of the year; and
the other, that nature may dictate to them
the de&s;ire of breathing the fre&s;h air they
were accu&s;tomed to in their youth, when
they learnt the different branches of hu&s;|bandry
bu&s;ine&s;s, which they return to at a
time when their town employment falls
&s;lack, and when, as I &s;aid before, we only
want them.</P>
<P>I am far from being an advocate for
wanton Luxury. There have been too
many in&s;tances in hi&s;tory, to prove that
Luxury, accompanied with vice, which is
its la&s;t &s;tage, mu&s;t ever end in ruin to a
&s;tate. All that I mean to alledge is, that
Luxury will attend the wealth of a great
trading nation, and that what was once a
virtue, cannot be converted into a vice. Let
tho&s;e who exclaim again&s;t the evil effects
of Luxury, keep a watchful eye over them|&s;elves,
and they will not have cau&s;e to
complain.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56">
Let tho&s;e who re&s;ide in the country &s;et a
good example to the poor inhabitants of
the village; let tho&s;e who have it in their
power dimini&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t not
increa&s;e, the number of alehou&s;es, which
are perdition to the poor, and the real
cau&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;s. I know many pa|ri&s;hes
in different parts of the country
where labourers maintain them&s;elves and
families comfortably, even in the&s;e times,
on &s;ix &s;hillings a week; whereas in other
places they are &s;tarving on nine in winter,
and ten to twelve in &s;ummer. But where
the former re&s;ide, there are no alehou&s;es,
and they them&s;elves attribute their comfort
to it: however, where they cannot be ea&s;ily
aboli&s;hed, let the re&s;trictive laws attending
licences be enforced; prevent gambling,
and do not &s;uffer them to permit a labour|ing
inhabitant of the pari&s;h to &s;it in their
hou&s;es but at the &s;tated hours of meal times;
this every one has it in his power to pre|vent;
and this I know to be one of the
chief cau&s;es of the di&s;tre&s;s of the poor, as
hath ju&s;tly been remarked by the Reverend
Mr. Powel, of Fakenham, in his <HI>Real
Grievances,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. On the real cau&s;es of the advanced price of
provi&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>THE real cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;car|city
being, in general, too well
known to need any formal di&s;cour&s;e to
a&s;certain its origin, it may, perhaps, be
thought impertinent in me to undertake
that ta&s;k: and, indeed, I hone&s;tly confe&s;s,
that the original intention of the&s;e &s;heets
was only to &s;hew, that it is not to be im|puted
&s;olely to any of the various cau&s;es I
have lately &s;een a&s;&s;igned for it in print.
Mo&s;t of tho&s;e publications have appeared
to me big with mi&s;chief, as blowing the
trumpet of di&s;content among every rank
of people; and, how&s;oever inadvertently
they may have been &s;uffered to creep into
the world, they cannot fail to breed, e&s;pe|cially
among the lower cla&s;s, that rancour
and jealou&s;y which are the mother of riot
and confu&s;ion, and which may, if thus
fomented, carry them to &s;uch lengths as
may &s;eriou&s;ly increa&s;e the misfortunes we
complain of. My only motive for thus
offering to the public my opinion on this
head, proceeds from an ardent de&s;ire to
rectify, if I can, the &s;trangely mi&s;con|ceived
notion of my countrymen, by prov|ing
<PB N="53" REF="58">
to them, that it is not to any indi|vidual,
or &s;et of individuals, that we
ought to a&s;cribe this calamity; but that
it is the hand of God which has vi&s;ited
us, and that it is patience only, with a
proper exertion of tho&s;e means which Pro|vidence
hath put in our power, that can
afford us relief. But as I find the number|le&s;s
complaints of the di&s;&s;atisfied have
reached the ear of the Legi&s;lature, and
that the Parliament &s;eem earne&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed
to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall appear to
them mo&s;t &s;alutary; I think it the duty of
every one who has con&s;idered this matter
candidly, to lay his thoughts open to
Government.</P>
<P>Previous to our entering upon this &s;ub|ject,
it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine into
the truth of what is daily a&s;&s;erted about
the price of provi&s;ions, and to determine
whether they are, or are not, really dear;
and, if found to be dear, how far the price
exceeds the bounds of what is deemed an
equitable one for the farmer. The only
method by which this fact can be a&s;cer|tained,
is to draw a compari&s;on between
them and other articles of con&s;umption; for
example, if the articles of cloaths, hou&s;e|rent,
furniture, luxuries of life, and pro|vi&s;ions,
have kept a nearly proportionate
<PB N="54" REF="59">
advance for any given number of years,
we have the cleare&s;t proof that there is
&s;ome one general extraneous cau&s;e which
affects the whole; and if it appears that
the ri&s;e in the price of all the various com|modities
bears a ju&s;t proportion to the
intere&s;t of money, it is as &s;elf-evident that
the general cau&s;e is the riches of the nation:
but to fix this with &s;uch preci&s;ion as would
carry with it univer&s;al conviction, would
require many <HI>data</HI> not ea&s;y to be obtained.
Thus, among other circum&s;tances, to make
a ju&s;t compari&s;on, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that
there &s;hould have been an equal demand
for every article; for on that will depend
the value of each. Now as I have de|clared
that &s;uch <HI>data</HI> as I would only
draw conclu&s;ions from are, in my opi|nion,
not to be obtained, I may claim
the &s;ame privilege as others a&s;&s;ume, of
grounding my facts on the general cry,
that all the nece&s;&s;aries of life are at an
enormous price, which, as I &s;aid before,
mu&s;t proceed from one general cau&s;e, and
that can only be the cheapne&s;s of money;
and therefore, that all commodities bearing
that proportion are cheap, at lea&s;t not dear.
However, as an extraordinary demand for,
or a &s;carcity of any article, mu&s;t affect
that article in a peculiar manner, I will
acknowledge that there is an advance in
<PB N="55" REF="60">
the price of provi&s;ions, though not &s;o great
as is generally believed, nor &s;uch as ought
to alarm this nation; nor will I &s;cruple to
pronounce, that this advance has been oc|ca&s;ioned
by a real &s;carcity of corn, pro|ceeding
from a failure of crops in gene|ral;
and that, for the&s;e five years pa&s;t, we
have had, at one or other time of the year,
the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons for corn that
have been known for a long while pa&s;t.
To this mu&s;t be imputed the natural cau&s;e
of the dearne&s;s of all commodities, and
among them, of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is the va&s;t influx of wealth, which,
though the great encourager of agriculture,
brings with it an apparent temporary evil.
This is the mother of luxury, which as
certainly creates wa&s;te, and, by an extra|ordinary
con&s;umption, undoubtedly affects
the markets; as was clearly proved to the
Hou&s;e of Lords about nine years ago, in the
examination of a per&s;on who had gone
through all the various branches of the
butcher's bu&s;ine&s;s, and who attributed the
great ri&s;e in meat, in a great mea&s;ure, to
the luxury of the town, &s;aying, that the
trade&s;man who formerly was contented with
a &s;houlder of mutton, mu&s;t now have his
fillet of veal, &amp;c. and by this luxury's
de&s;cending to the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, there were
<PB N="56" REF="61">
not tho&s;e cu&s;tomers for the offal-pieces,
which were con&s;equently in a manner
thrown away. This might be the opinion
of a &s;ingle man; but certain it is, that the
con&s;umption of veal and lamb has increa&s;ed
to a prodigious degree; and, as I mentioned
before, the expence of the food nece&s;&s;ary to
bring tho&s;e young animals to market being
as much in four months as would maintain
them as a breeding &s;tock for two years,
that mu&s;t undoubtedly have an effect upon
all other butcher's meat, and this will as
&s;urely affect other provi&s;ions, in a certain
proportion.</P>
<P>There is yet another manner in which
luxury has operated: it has increa&s;ed the
number of po&s;t-hor&s;es within the&s;e twenty
years, as ten to one. The increa&s;e of
&s;tage-coaches too has been very con&s;ider|able,
as has likewi&s;e the number of wag|gon-hor&s;es:
the&s;e la&s;t, indeed, have been
in con&s;equence of internal trade: yet all
the&s;e are, directly or indirectly, in con&s;e|quence
of luxury, which has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;o
many fa&s;hionable places of re&s;ort for people
of all ranks and denominations, and in
which li&s;t the city of London has furni&s;hed
no incon&s;iderable part; for money, which,
in a trading nation, puts all men on a level,
&s;oon teaches the trade&s;man and his family
<PB N="57" REF="62">
that they can a&s;&s;ociate with people of rank
and fa&s;hion: thus &s;ervants, mimicking their
ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, as &s;oon forget the
prudent oeconomy of the pantry and cellar,
and vye with my lord's butler and my
lady's woman in every wanton extrava|gance,
which, fatal as it proves in the end,
does not at fir&s;t di&s;plea&s;e the good &s;ober
citizen: but this is the natural channel in
which riches ever will and ought to flow.
It is by the&s;e means that the wealth acquired
by the trading individual becomes equally
diffu&s;ed among all ranks of men: it is ex|tended
even to the chimney-&s;weeper's boy,
who, in&s;tead of the cru&s;t of bread which
u&s;ed to be his fee, now receives a mor&s;el of
meat: but at la&s;t, though too late, the
trade&s;man di&s;covers that he and his family
have purcha&s;ed a reli&s;h for plea&s;ure and ex|travagance
with a diminution of his capital.
He feels with redoubled force every little
blow in trade, becau&s;e he dares not retrench,
from a mi&s;con&s;trued pride, and fear of in|juring
his credit: he &s;tretches every &s;inew
to extend that credit and increa&s;e his trade:
perhaps, at la&s;t, con&s;cious that his own will
not &s;upport his extravagance, he flies to
that of his neighbour, who, at the &s;ame
moment, may be getting into his. Thus
has trade been over-done, and credit, &s;o
e&s;&s;ential for a commercial nation, totally
<PB N="58" REF="63">
ruined. Stock-jobbing, and every &s;pecies
of gambling, have &s;ucceeded, and have now
brought on a general bankruptcy among
tho&s;e people who were once improperly
thought the chief &s;upport of this country.</P>
<P>But let not this picture deceive us. It
only proves what common &s;en&s;e ought
to have taught before, which is, that trade
can be extended but to a certain degree,
and that the only one which can be bene|&s;icial
to a nation is the export of the produce
of the earth. Such part of it as can be
manufactured is undoubtedly doubly ad|vantageous:
it maintains a number of men
who are the &s;trength of a nation, whil&s;t fo|reigners,
who buy the manufactured goods,
pay their wages, which, in fact, becomes
an advanced price upon our corn and meat.
But as the demand for goods may be
limited, do not let us confine our&s;elves to
the growth of &s;o much corn only as will
maintain them, let the &s;urplus be exported,
and though not attended with &s;o much
profit, it is always an addition to the other;
the returns for which, in merchandize or
&s;pecie, are our riches. Merchants, nece&s;|&s;ary
as they are, are no more than the
carriers of tho&s;e commodities: take them in
any other view, they are men preying upon
one another: one individual is enriched,
while the other is ruined; and whether the
<PB N="59" REF="64">
trade is among our&s;elves, or with others, &s;o
&s;oon as it exceeds the bounds of our produce
and manufactures, it is gambling, and, as
in all other games of chance, at the end of
the year, the profits will only pay the cards.
But mi&s;erable as the pre&s;ent &s;cene appears,
it by no means proves that the country is
not rich; it only &s;hews how money may be,
and how it is, di&s;per&s;ed and divided among
all ranks, and I could prove, happily for this
nation, that much of it is &s;unk in the bowels
of the earth, from which grateful trea&s;ury
we are &s;ure to receive ample returns. The
new cultivated lands, and improvements in
agriculture, with the great inland navi|gations,
have &s;wallowed up immen&s;e &s;ums
in the purcha&s;e of corn to feed the labourers.
The&s;e are the real riches of a country. It
would be wrong to imagine, that becau&s;e
&s;ome few individuals have over-traded them|&s;elves,
and want money, therefore the nation
is poor; look at the riches that are ama&s;&s;ed
among the farmers, and ble&s;s your&s;elves
that it has got into the hands of men who
will turn it to a national benefit; while they
thrive, the intere&s;t of your funds will con|tinue
low, and land will keep its price:
the&s;e are the only touch&s;tones of the value
of money.</P>
<P>But before I quit this &s;ubject, let me
hint that I do not draw the di&s;tinction
<PB N="60" REF="65">
between agriculture, manufactures and com|merce;
I know them all to be &s;o dependant
on each other, that the prevalence of either
is prejudicial to this nation: all I contend
for is, that the &s;ource of the whole is agri|culture.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who attempt to point out the
di&s;tinct advantage ari&s;ing from either agri|culture,
manufactures, or commerce, are
little acquainted with the true policy of this
nation; for if they recollect that the natural
produce of this country con&s;i&s;ts in corn
for the u&s;e of man, and other &s;taple com|modities
for our manufactures, &s;uch as
hides, wool, tin, lead, and iron, they will
conceive that the labourers of the earth and
the manufacturers are &s;o mutually dependent
one on the other, that to obtain the greate&s;t
national advantage from their reciprocal
labours, would almo&s;t &s;eem to demand that
a ju&s;t proportionate number of each &s;hould
be pre&s;erved: I &s;ay, in point of the profit
to be made on the produce of the earth,
which is the natural riches of a country,
this would &s;eem to be the ca&s;e, with an ad|ditional
number in agriculture to provide
food for their own body, and the third
cla&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts of the navy, army,
and idle people: but no advantage could
ari&s;e from &s;uch a di&s;tribution without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of traders, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to
<PB N="61" REF="66">
export our manufactured &s;taple commodi|ties,
or the &s;urplus of &s;uch as are not
required for the different manufactures in
their raw &s;tate: in return for the&s;e, the
trader brings us back either &s;pecie, or, by
way of barter, the luxuries of life, or raw
materials for &s;ome manufactures, which we
have not within our&s;elves, but are nece&s;&s;ary
for them. In this manner are the&s;e three
cla&s;&s;es &s;o intimately dependant on each
other, that neither can exi&s;t alone in this
country, I mean to a national advantage;
nor in this view is it ea&s;y to determine to
which &s;hould be a&s;cribed the preference in
point of rank: for unle&s;s we grew our own
corn, our manufactures would not be &s;o be|neficial
to the country, nor without manufac|tures
would our corn be exported to &s;o great
advantage; nor would either be nationally
advantageous in point of riches if they could
not be exported. This therefore calls in
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the merchant, who&s;e trade
would not be beneficial to the nation unle&s;s
his exports con&s;i&s;ted in the produce of the
earth; and in the proportion that &s;uch ex|ports
exceed the value of his imports, the
balance is in favour of this country.</P>
<P>Let it however be ob&s;erved, that the ad|vantage
ari&s;ing from this chain of traffic is
limited to a certain pitch, beyond which it
<PB N="62" REF="67">
cannot extend: it mu&s;t be governed by the
demand of foreign markets, which is al|ways
regulated by the con&s;umption, but
too often &s;ubject to the caprice of courts;
therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine the
exact proportion of hands proper to be al|lotted
to each different cla&s;s. It mu&s;t then
remain an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that, as Sir
James Stuart has &s;o ably &s;hewn, each
cla&s;s will, from time to time, be &s;upplied
with the overflowings of the other, as exi|gencies
direct: but it &s;hould be remembered,
that manufactories can at no time employ
more than are requi&s;ite at that particular
time to &s;upply the demands of trade;
whereas the culture of the earth cannot
be over-done. If the quantity of corn and
cattle produced &s;hould, by being too great
for the con&s;umption, reduce the price below
what is a rea&s;onable profit for the farmer,
that cheapne&s;s will create mouths to eat it,
that is, men will flock in from different
countries to that &s;pot where there is the
greate&s;t plenty. This will make us formi|dable
in point of people, and the taxes on
what they con&s;ume will increa&s;e the revenue,
&s;o as to enable the Government to di&s;charge
part of its debt, at lea&s;t enable it to protect
its territories, without loading the Poor with
a fre&s;h burden. This argument would rather
&s;eemingly lead to give the preference to
<PB N="63" REF="68">
agriculture: but I &s;hall contend for no more
than to call it the &s;pring of the whole machine.</P>
<P>In contradiction to what I have advanced,
I am aware that there are tho&s;e who will &s;ay,
that the whole of my theory is di&s;proved by
the in&s;tance of Holland. But let &s;uch re|member,
that what I have &s;aid relates to the
policy of England only, and that though
Holland has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and become powerful
by trade alone, it has been owing to the
very particular circum&s;tances which have
attended the &s;ituation of the Dutch: they
e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in a little &s;wampy
corner, hemmed in on all &s;ides by enemies,
who&s;e reciprocal intere&s;t it was to protect
them again&s;t each other: by this means
their little &s;pot became an a&s;ylum for trade
to all parties, and thus they became like|wi&s;e
the carriers and bankers of Europe,
and by the&s;e concomitant circum&s;tances,
art has &s;upplied them with what nature
furni&s;hes us.</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;ubject of hor&s;es,
which, I am confident, have helped to
rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ions, for they mu&s;t
con&s;ume a great part of the produce of
the earth, and in a much greater proportion
than other cattle, which are not fed &s;o
highly. Therefore, unle&s;s it appears that
the importation of oats during the&s;e la&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="69">
twenty years has greatly increa&s;ed, it is
evident that either the quantity of other corn
grown, has decrea&s;ed, or that more ground
has been cultivated, and as certain that
unle&s;s the quantity of gra&s;s land has increa&s;ed
in the &s;ame degree, there cannot remain the
&s;ame proportion for the feeding of young
&s;teers, as there was before the breeding of
the&s;e additional hor&s;es. With regard to the
number that have been exported, as much
as it has been exclaimed again&s;t, &s;urely no
man who con&s;iders the matter coolly can
&s;ee it in any other light than as being
greatly beneficial to the nation; for whether
we export the corn, or the cattle that feed
on it, the money received is for the produce
of the earth.</P>
<P>We all know that more land has been
taken into culture, and that the inclo&s;ing of
common-field land has increa&s;ed the pro|duce:
but, I am apt to believe, not in a
proportion equal to the con&s;umption; and
I am farther of opinion, that a greater part
has been devoted to the growth of food
for hor&s;es: for the extraordinary ri&s;e in the
price of oats within the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t,
in which that grain has exceeded all pro|portion
with other corn, and the uniform
and &s;teady price oats have kept at, are &s;uch
inducements to a farmer, that it is &s;carcely
<PB N="65" REF="70">
po&s;&s;ible to believe he would not attend to
the growth of that &s;pecies of corn, as well
as, in the breeding countries, to the rai&s;ing
of colts in&s;tead of &s;teers: for a &s;erviceable
colt, at three years old, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of a few pecks of ground meal, will fetch
as much as an ox at &s;even, with a whole
&s;ummer's fattening. By the&s;e methods, I
believe, luxury has operated in the ri&s;e of
provi&s;ions: but &s;urely no man will ad|vance
&s;o dangerous a doctrine, as to &s;ay
that any thing which encourages agricul|ture
can be prejudicial to a &s;tate.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this
nation, it is evident to me, that our pro|duce,
in a middling year, is but barely
equal to our con&s;umption: it is certain,
that by the great concour&s;e of the poorer
&s;ort of people to great cities, the con&s;ump|tion
of wheaten bread is greater than it was
when many of the&s;e fed on barley, rye,
or oats: nor has this &s;pecies of luxury failed
to diffu&s;e it&s;elf thro' many country places.
It has likewi&s;e been demon&s;trated by many,
but particularly by the ingenious author of
the Corn-Tracts, that the con&s;umption of
wheat has been nearly equal to the growth,
and that, even in the mo&s;t plentiful years, our
exports have not amounted to above the value
of 947,000 <HI>l.</HI> Let tho&s;e who doubt this fact,
<PB N="66" REF="71">
con&s;ult Sir James Stewart's Enquiry into
the Principles of Political Oeconomy, vol. I.
page 58. If the&s;e are facts, it is pretty
evident to me, that our average crops do
but barely equal the con&s;umption, and
con&s;equently, that, when crops fail, we
mu&s;t feel that deficiency. It is therefore
not to be wondered at, that if after five
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad years, we &s;hould be appre|hen&s;ive
of want; at lea&s;t that provi&s;ions
mu&s;t ri&s;e. The evil points out its own
remedy. If your con&s;umption is greater
than, or but equal to your produce, increa&s;e
the latter, and plenty mu&s;t reduce the price:
for though other cau&s;es may operate in a
certain degree, plenty or &s;carcity mu&s;t go|vern
the price of all provi&s;ions. This in|crea&s;e
can only be produced by a &s;en&s;ible
encouragement to the farmer, by convin|cing
him that his intere&s;t is concerned in
it, by &s;ecuring to him a con&s;tant con&s;ump|tion
for his grain, that he may not be &s;ub|ject
to ruin by his trade being over-done.
As the means of doing this are evident to
me, though perhaps not to every one, I
&s;hall point them out in the following
chapter.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="67" REF="72">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V. On the means of procuring plenty.</HEAD>
<P>MY principal aim in the foregoing
pages has been to prove that the
pre&s;ent advanced price of provisions is not
occa&s;ioned by the &s;uppo&s;ed increa&s;e of large
farms, and to explain to the Legi&s;lature,
that though Luxury and Fore&s;tallers may
bear &s;ome proportion in the cau&s;e, the chief
one is real &s;carcity. For the truth of this,
I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h the Parliament would
examine &s;uch men, from the different
counties of England, as they think they
can rely on: for a few partial examinations
cannot determine the point; as local cir|cum&s;tances
will ever mi&s;guide. The aver|age
of the whole will, I fear, prove what
I a&s;&s;ert; and I am &s;till more concerned to
&s;ay, that it is not &s;u&s;ceptible of any pre|&s;ent
relief. All that can be done by Le|gi&s;lature,
as the laws now &s;tand, has been
put in force; I mean, the opening of our
ports: But where is the corn to come
from? In Holland, it is as dear as with
us. The ports in Flanders and France are
&s;hut. In the Baltic, they have been open
and &s;hut &s;everal times within the&s;e twelve
months. Sicily is &s;hut, except for a limited
<PB N="68" REF="73">
quantity to be exported for the u&s;e of the
Pope's dominions. In America, wheat is
now 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> &s;terling the bu&s;hel, and cannot
be imported here at our price. If the&s;e facts
are true, it will be allowed that there is no
great pro&s;pect of immediate relief. Pa|tience
is our only re&s;ource. We have had
five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad crops, and this la&s;t more
generally &s;o than any of the former. It
has been nearly the &s;ame all over Europe:
therefore, till there is a plentiful year, corn
cannot be cheap. All that the Legi&s;lature
can do, is to endeavour to guard again&s;t
&s;uch an evil befalling us again; and this,
in my opinion, is in their power: but,
&s;alutary as the mea&s;ure may be, it cannot
be effectually accompli&s;hed till corn is plen|tiful,
and nearly at an equal price all over
Europe.</P>
<P>But corn is not the only article in pro|vi&s;ions
that is thought too dear: meat bears
a ju&s;t proportion to it, and till the latter is
reduced, it will be vain to expect a fall in
the former: in fact, they are, and ought
to be, &s;o dependant on each other, that
the &s;ame cau&s;e will produce the &s;ame effects
in each; and it is clear to me, that more
land is wanted both for pa&s;ture and the
plough; for it is not to be di&s;puted that
the number of hor&s;es kept in this country,
<PB N="69" REF="74">
and the number nece&s;&s;ary for breeding tho&s;e
that are exported, mu&s;t con&s;ume the pro|duce
of many of tho&s;e acres which would
be alloted to other purpo&s;es. This is un|doubtedly
one of the cau&s;es of provi&s;ions
being ri&s;en in price: but it is an evil at|tended
with &s;o great benefit, that it ought
to be endured; for it is an encouragement
to agriculture, and by what&s;oever mode
this is encouraged, it will operate every
way to the advantage of this country,
which ought to con&s;ider hu&s;bandry as the
&s;ource of her wealth and &s;trength.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame in regard to the
de&s;truction of lambs and calves, which cer|tainly
con&s;ume as much food as would
maintain a much greater number of rear|ing
&s;tock: but this is a &s;pecies of luxury
which, though attended with &s;ome pre&s;ent
inconveniencies, mu&s;t be complied with;
excepting in particular times, as when a
murrain alarms the nation: for, exclu&s;ive
of the political &s;en&s;e in which the national
advantage of agriculture &s;ould be con&s;i|dered,
it is dangerous to check the inno|cent
luxury of a free and wealthy people.
The extraordinary incentive which Britons
have, beyond all other nations, to exert
their ingenuity and indu&s;try, is a perfect
&s;ecurity for their enjoying the fruits of their
<PB N="70" REF="75">
labours as they plea&s;e, uncontrouled by any
thing but the laws of the land, which
&s;hould be, and are, a check on tho&s;e only
who wi&s;h to go beyond the bounds of civil
&s;ociety; for &s;urely every one has a right to
enjoy his own inherited po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and
how much more &s;o is that man entitled to
&s;uch &s;ecurity, who acquires his by indu|&s;try?
Yet this &s;ecurity encourages luxury,
which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, increa&s;es the &s;up|po&s;ed
evil. Again&s;t this there is not, in
my opinion, any &s;alutary remedy. A
government may indeed avail it&s;elf of the
folly of men, and rai&s;e a con&s;iderable &s;um
by levying a &s;evere tax on po&s;t-hor&s;es, and
other different &s;pecies of luxury; but how
far that is advi&s;eable, I humbly &s;ubmit to
Legi&s;lature. I am confident it would in|crea&s;e
the revenue, for I am certain it would
increa&s;e the evil, as every man is proud of
vying with his neighbour in extravagance:
but if it is an evil, let it not meet with
&s;uch encouragement, and let us attend to
tho&s;e points which only can afford real and
con&s;tant plenty, I mean, the cultivation of
more land; for though many wa&s;te acres
have lately been brought into culture, it is
evident from what has been &s;aid above,
that the quantity is not equal to the in|crea&s;ed
con&s;umption: was it otherwi&s;e,
provi&s;ions would be cheap, becau&s;e they
<PB N="71" REF="76">
would be plentiful; which is the only
thing that can counterbalance the effect of
riches and luxury. In evidence of what I
&s;ay, let me remind the reader of the price
of provi&s;ions, and even dainties, at Bath,
to which, though a place of di&s;&s;ipation,
many re&s;ort in order to live cheap.</P>
<P>This being my idea, I &s;hall not &s;cruple
to point out, as the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep to
be taken, the inclo&s;ing and parcelling out
of all the King's Fore&s;ts and Chaces, which
now lie a di&s;grace to a Mini&s;ter who wi&s;hes
to be thought to li&s;ten to the complaints of
a nation. Let corn &s;upply the place of
tho&s;e mi&s;erable pollards, and let flocks and
herds &s;upplant the half-&s;tarved deer which
prowl about to tempt poor wretches to
the gallows; for it is deer-&s;tealing that in|duces
tho&s;e who are born on the chaces to
lead an idle life, which corrupts their mo|rals,
and makes them the terror of every
hone&s;t man in their neighbourhood. Their
example likewi&s;e corrupts many who might
otherwi&s;e, probably, be u&s;eful indu&s;trious
&s;ubjects. By this a mini&s;ter would entail
immortal honour on his admini&s;tration, and
at the &s;ame time that the poor would be
employed and fed, the coffers of his Royal
Ma&s;ter would be filled. The ta&s;k is not
in reality &s;o very arduous as &s;ome may
<PB N="72" REF="77">
imagine, nor need the Mini&s;ter who under|takes
it fear the re&s;entment of tho&s;e who
derive to them&s;elves emoluments from the
pre&s;ent u&s;ele&s;s and de&s;olate &s;tate of tho&s;e
otherwi&s;e truly valuable lands. Pen&s;ions
for their lives, far &s;uperior to what they
can ever make by their fore&s;t-tenures, may
be &s;ecured to them, and yet a triple re&s;idue
be left to their Prince, who, in the pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of tho&s;e lands, can reap no other
benefit from them than that of providing
for a good &s;ervant, and that too in a man|ner
which no good man would wi&s;h.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the intended good purpo&s;e,
the undertaking mu&s;t be conducted with
judgment, and a &s;trict attention to ju&s;tice.
Let then the fir&s;t &s;tep be the bringing a bill
into Parliament, to oblige the &s;everal pa|ri&s;hes
and per&s;ons who have right of com|monage,
&amp;c. upon the King's fore&s;ts, to
a&s;certain tho&s;e rights, and to mark out
&s;uch boundaries as &s;hall be equivalent for
them, and let the turn of the &s;cale be in
their favour; for the purpo&s;e of the pub|lic
will be equally an&s;wered if the&s;e lands
are but appropriated: they will then by
degrees come into culture. Such rights as
&s;hall not be a&s;certained within a certain
limited time, to be &s;ettled by commi&s;&s;ioners
appointed by Parliament; and what &s;hall
<PB N="73" REF="78">
afterwards remain to the Crown, may be
di&s;po&s;ed of in the following manner;</P>
<P>Allot to each cottager his few acres, and
to each little farmer &s;uch proportion as he
can conveniently add to his farm; if many
of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es are near each other,
they will form an u&s;eful village: then let
the more open parts be divided into lots of
one hundred acres, and be put up to auction
on &s;uch terms as the Crown can grant,
either for three lives, or upon lea&s;es of
thirty-one years, renewable every &s;even
years. When I &s;ay, lots of one hundred
acres, I do not mean to confine every pur|cha&s;er
to a &s;ingle lot: let every man pur|cha&s;e
what tract he plea&s;es; for, certainly,
it is from the opulent man that the greate&s;t
benefit is to be expected; but to &s;ecure that
benefit, let it be a condition, that within a
certain number of years, the whole of each
man's purcha&s;e &s;hall be in culture, on pain
of forfeiture of his whole purcha&s;e, with
every partial improvement that has been
made thereon. This will &s;ecure to the
Crown &s;uch purcha&s;ers as can accompli&s;h
what they undertake, and will prevent the
land's being bought up by any rich indi|vidual
who may wi&s;h to pre&s;erve it for
deer and moor-game: the&s;e are truly mo|nopolizers
of lands, and not tho&s;e who,
<PB N="74" REF="79">
employing 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> in agriculture, can,
and do, make land produce more than the
little farmer who can barely &s;ub&s;i&s;t: how|ever,
both are nece&s;&s;ary; for as I have be|fore
&s;aid, every man's farm ought to be in
proportion to his capital, and thus both are
equally u&s;eful to the community. I repeat
this to &s;hew, that though I think the little
farmer nece&s;&s;ary, I would not wi&s;h the
opulent one to be excluded; and under the
re&s;trictions I have mentioned, no evil can
en&s;ue; for though the&s;e laws are not en|forced
at the di&s;tance of America, yet here
they might with ea&s;e. Let every po&s;&s;ible
encouragement be given to the undertakers:
let the fir&s;t fine be in lieu of &s;o many years
rent, which &s;hould not commence before
the &s;eventh year; let the&s;e lands remain for
ever free from tythe, &amp;c. making a proper
provi&s;ion for the church by an allotment
of a certain number of acres; and for the
encouragement of cattle, let tho&s;e who work
oxen be exempted from a certain propor|tion
of rent: that may once more intro|duce
the u&s;e of tho&s;e noble animals. En|couragement
may prevail; but taxes and
re&s;trictions operate too ha&s;tily and too har&s;h|ly,
and will never an&s;wer any good end
in a free country. Let but the experiment
be made in one &s;ingle chace or fore&s;t, and
by the effect of that let the re&s;t be governed,
<PB N="75" REF="80">
Let an accurate &s;urvey be made, and the
different lots delineated: this will be the
only expence that will attend it; for each
lot will find its value. The only re&s;triction
I would annex to the tenure &s;hould be,
that tho&s;e lots which were converted into
arable land &s;hould, within a certain num|ber
of years, have a barn and two cottages
erected on them; or, if intended for gra&s;s,
&s;heds and cottages &s;uitable to the quantity
of land. Let all the trees, excepting only
&s;uch as might be picked out for his Ma|je&s;ty's
yards, and which &s;hould be pre|viou&s;ly
marked, be included in the pur|cha&s;e-money of the lot on which they
&s;tand. This will be a reciprocal advantage
to both: it will, on the one hand, &s;ave the
expence of removing them, and it will
enable the tenant either to pre&s;erve &s;ome
in ca&s;e of pa&s;ture land, or he will have
wood on the &s;pot to erect the nece&s;&s;ary
buildings. If &s;uch a plan as this &s;hould
ever take place, it would bring in a con|&s;iderable
revenue to the Crown, and &s;et a
noble example to gentlemen of landed pro|perty
to convert their many barren acres
into u&s;eful pa&s;ture or corn-fields.</P>
<P>A better authority can no where be
produced to &s;upport my arguments on this
<PB N="76" REF="81">
occa&s;ion, than that of the illu&s;trious Mr.
Evelyn, in his <HI>Sylva.</HI> His advice on this
&s;ubject does honour to the country that
gave him birth. His de&s;cription of our
fore&s;ts, in a quotation from Law&s;on, points
out their deplorable &s;tate in too lively co|lours;
nor have we rea&s;on to think they
have been improved in the cour&s;e of the&s;e
la&s;t hundred years. "In our fore&s;ts (&s;ays
he) you &s;hall have for one lively thriving
tree, four, nay &s;ometimes twenty-four,
evil thriving, rotten, and dying trees; and
in&s;tead of trees, thou&s;ands of bu&s;hes and
&s;hrubs. What rottenne&s;s, what hollowne&s;s,
what dead arms, withered tops, curtailed
trunks; what loads of mo&s;s, dropping
boughs, and dying branches, &s;hall you &s;ee
every where!"</P>
<P>On this Mr. Evelyn ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that
the condition they are in &s;peaks them to be
the property of a broken and decaying
freeholder; and adds, "Let not then the
Royal patrimony bear a bankrupt's re|proach."</P>
<P>But when I quote &s;uch an author, let
me here give his opinion of the mode in
which he thinks tho&s;e tracts can be made
mo&s;t u&s;eful to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="82">
"There is not, &s;ays he, a cheaper, ea&s;ier,
or more prompt expedient to advance &s;hip|timber,
than to &s;olicit that in all his Maje&s;ty's
fore&s;ts, woods, and parks, the &s;preading
oak, &amp;c. be cheri&s;hed by plowing and &s;ow|ing."
He &s;uppo&s;es the royal fore&s;ts to
contain about 200,000 acres, and after
pointing out the method of improving them,
concludes in the following words: "The
care of &s;o public and honourable an en|terprize
is a right noble and royal under|taking;
and I do pronounce it more
worthy of a Prince who truly con&s;ults
his glory in the highe&s;t intere&s;t of his
&s;ubjects, than that of gaining battles or
&s;ubduing a province."</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn has &s;o properly recommended
a provident care of timber for the navy,
and &s;o judiciou&s;ly pointed out the method in
which it &s;hould be managed, that I cannot
but hope &s;ome attention may be paid to the
in&s;tructions of &s;o ju&s;tly-celebrated a man:
therefore all that I &s;hall propo&s;e to my&s;elf
here will be to make my plan coincide as
much as po&s;&s;ible with his ideas. He tells
us, that to procure good timber, every oak
&s;hould &s;tand &s;ingle, and that the frequent
plowing of the ground will cheri&s;h and
nouri&s;h the roots &s;o as to make the tree
thrive amazingly: but, though it is with
<PB N="78" REF="83">
the utmo&s;t diffidence that I &s;hall venture
to offer an opinion in competition with
him, I cannot help remarking, that if his
plan is properly executed over the whole
fore&s;t, all thoughts of converting it into
arable mu&s;t drop, for the &s;hade of tho&s;e
trees di&s;po&s;ed as he recommends would
render it unfit for corn; and it is as certain,
that if they were confined to hedge-rows
they would not become &s;uch fine timber,
for the ditches, which would naturally be
clo&s;e to them, mu&s;t prevent the exten&s;ion
of &s;ome of their roots, and the bu&s;hes and
briars would injure them by excluding the
air from their trunks. I would therefore
propo&s;e, that half of the land be dedicated
to pa&s;ture, where the trees might &s;tand &s;cat|tered
over the fields, and the di&s;tance which
Mr. Evelyn allots them would rather benefit
than prejudice the pa&s;turage, as well as
afford &s;hade for the cattle. By con&s;tant
feeding, the ground will certainly be en|riched,
and if it is likewi&s;e kept free from
bu&s;hes, I cannot &s;ee why the trees upon it
&s;hould not thrive nearly, if not quite, as
well as if it was cultivated by the plough,
which operation could be almo&s;t &s;olely for
their benefit, as the crops that might grow
there would, I doubt, &s;carcely repay the
expence of labour. The remaining half of
the ground would be &s;ufficient to grow corn
<PB N="79" REF="84">
for the inhabitants of the fore&s;t, who could
not be very numerous under this culture,
together with cabbages, turnips, and fodder
for the bea&s;ts in the winter: thus, &s;up|po&s;ing,
as Mr. Evelyn does, that there are
two hundred thou&s;and acres of land in the
fore&s;ts, &amp;c. one hundred thou&s;and of them
will be pa&s;ture. To the four trees which he
allots to each acre, making in all 400,000
trees, I &s;hall add in the intermediate &s;paces,
an equal number for &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and I
would have all the pa&s;ture land be &s;ur|rounded
by a nur&s;ery well &s;ecured with
double fences.</P>
<P>This is the way in which, I think, the
fore&s;ts and chaces may be converted to the
greate&s;t u&s;e: for whether they are employed
in breeding and fattening of cattle, or in
growing of corn, they will equally an&s;wer
the intended purpo&s;e of producing plenty;
and in this manner a valuable trea&s;ure will
be kept up for the navy. As to the mode
of accompli&s;hing it, that requires only de|termination;
for the bu&s;ine&s;s is then done.
Let the conditions of planting, fencing,
and pre&s;erving, be annexed to the lea&s;e,
under a forfeiture of it upon non-com|pliance
with the terms; and in con&s;ide|ration
of the trouble and expence of pre|&s;erving
the trees and nur&s;eries, let there be
<PB N="80" REF="85">
a proportionate deduction in the rent. An
annual &s;urvey, by an hone&s;t man, would
ea&s;ily enforce the execution of whatever
might be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>If what I have thrown out on this &s;ubject
&s;hould either coincide with the general
opinion, or afford any hint for a better plan,
I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy. But at the
&s;ame time that I deliver the&s;e as my &s;enti|ments
in regard to the advantage which
would accrue to the Public from the in|clo&s;ure
and cultivation of the royal fore&s;ts
and chaces, I confe&s;s that it is without even
the &s;malle&s;t hope of ever &s;eeing any part of
this plan put in execution. Many difficul|ties,
which mu&s;t be obvious to every one
who knows the di&s;tribution of places de|pendant
on the&s;e fore&s;ts, &s;eem almo&s;t in&s;u|perable.&mdash;I
therefore beg leave to offer
another plan, one that is practicable, and
which cannot fail to do honour to the ad|mini&s;tration
of the Mini&s;ter who &s;hall effect
it. Let a &s;um of money be voted to his
Maje&s;ty, to purcha&s;e a tract of land on the
moors, and let this land be put into the
hands of an intelligent indu&s;trious man, to
improve it; and let the profit be his reward.
The &s;um thus &s;unk will be the only ex|pence
incurred by Government; and &s;uch
<PB N="81" REF="86">
an example to men of landed property
will be truly worthy of a great King.</P>
<P>When I appear &s;o &s;trenuous an advocate
for cultivating wa&s;te lands, it may readily
be believed, that I &s;hall recommend as
&s;trongly the giving of every po&s;&s;ible encou|ragement
to inclo&s;ing bills. Let not the
mi&s;taken zeal of well-di&s;po&s;ed, but ignorant
people, per&s;uade the man of &s;en&s;e that it is
prejudicial to the Poor. Create but work
for them, and their numbers cannot be too
great; nor will they want bread. The
benefit which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to reap
from commons, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, I
know to be merely nominal; nay, indeed,
what is wor&s;e, I know, that, in many in|&s;tances,
it is an e&s;&s;ential injury to them, by
being made a plea for their idlene&s;s; for,
&s;ome few excepted, if you offer them work,
they will tell you, that they mu&s;t go to look
up their &s;heep, cut furzes, get their cow
out of the pound, or perhaps &s;ay they mu&s;t
take their hor&s;e to be &s;hod, that he may
carry them to a hor&s;e-race or cricket-match.
The fir&s;t is plau&s;ible; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay
merely &s;o, becau&s;e the benefit which the
&s;heep are of either to him&s;elf or the
country is not an object worth notice: the
little care that &s;uch people can take of them,
frequently occa&s;ions the lo&s;s of their lambs,
<PB N="82" REF="87">
and the difficulty, nay indeed impo&s;&s;ibility,
of &s;upporting them in the winter, is the
death of the few &s;crubby things which
have been eating the gra&s;s that would have
maintained an u&s;eful flock: but if there is
a farmer in the neighbourhood who does
keep a flock, then the benefit which the
cottager would have, even in the &s;ummer,
mu&s;t vani&s;h; for if there is a &s;hepherd to
this flock, he will take care that his &s;heep
have the be&s;t of the feed; and what is
more remarkable, though true, is, that if
a large flock are daily turned out on a
common by them&s;elves, they only will re|ceive
the benefit of it, and the common
&s;heep will fly before them to &s;eek their
mi&s;erable &s;u&s;tenance among the bu&s;hes and
furzes. It is on this account that our com|mons,
circum&s;tanced as they generally are,
without limitation, are advantageous only
to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of the pari&s;h;
whereas, if they were inclo&s;ed, they would
produce twice the quantity of food if re|&s;erved
for pa&s;ture, becau&s;e the furzes would
be grubbed up; or if they were divided,
they would produce their proportion of
corn. I mention the&s;e trivial circum&s;tances
in an&s;wer to &s;ome gentlemen who, I am
convinced, oppo&s;e inclo&s;ures from a laud|able
&s;pirit of taking care of the Poor,
which I would propo&s;e doing in a much
<PB N="83" REF="88">
more effectual manner in all future in|clo&s;ures.</P>
<P>My plan is, to allot to each cottage three
or four acres, which &s;hould be annexed to
it without power of alienation, and with|out
rent; but under the covenant of being
kept in gra&s;s, except &s;uch &s;mall part as
&s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for a garden: this would
keep the cottager in more plenty than a
very exten&s;ive range of common: he and
his family mu&s;t then cultivate the garden,
or &s;uffer as they ought to do: and to ob|viate
the plea of their wanting fuel, let it
be fenced and planted with a&s;h and other
quick growing trees, at the expence of
tho&s;e who are to have the property of the
common. This would be a real benefit to
him, as it would employ his wife and chil|dren,
and help to &s;upport his family whil&s;t
he is at work for the farmers in the neigh|bourhood,
in&s;tead of depending, as they
too often do, upon the &s;uppo&s;ed profits of
their commonage. The commons in the
pari&s;h of Chailley in Su&s;&s;ex afford remark|able
in&s;tances of what I advance. Mr.
Young ob&s;erves, in Vol. iii. p. 153, of the
Farmer's Tour, that in that pari&s;h the rates
are 9<HI>s.</HI> in the pound; and on enquiry into
the cau&s;e of it, found, that it was owing
to the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the commons, which
<PB N="84" REF="89">
induced many to rely on the cows and &s;heep
they could keep, to exempt them from la|bour;
the con&s;equence of which was their
coming on the pari&s;h upon any lo&s;s they &s;uf|fered
in their cattle, having acquired that idle
habit which would not permit them to work.
In&s;tead of this, an indu&s;trious life leads them
to a knowledge of tho&s;e real and rea&s;onable
comforts which I wi&s;h them to enjoy; &s;uch
as, a good dwelling decently furni&s;hed, they
and their children well fed and clad; and
if the&s;e la&s;t are early brought up to hone&s;t
labour, in&s;tead of pilfering, there cannot
be a better &s;ecurity for their not becoming
a burden to the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>I am aware that there may be objections
&s;tarted to what I have now propo&s;ed, by
&s;aying, that though this land may be &s;e|cured
to the pre&s;ent occupier, yet it will be
in the power of the landlord, provided it is
not the cottager's own, to rai&s;e the rent, or
that, when the cottagers families grow up,
and more cottages are built, the ground
being all di&s;po&s;ed of, there will not remain
any to annex to the new cottages. In my
opinion, the&s;e difficulties are ea&s;ily obvi|ated;
for as the landlords are to be bene|fited
by their proportion of the common,
they may, by the &s;ame act, be re&s;trained
from rai&s;ing the rents of the old ones; and
<PB N="85" REF="90">
as the land-holders are the only people who
will build, or grant building lea&s;es, they
may be obliged in future to annex to each
new-erected cottage an equal proportion of
land.</P>
<P>There is indeed one other re&s;trictive
clau&s;e which I would add to the&s;e inclo&s;ing
bills, I mean when commons are to be
converted into arable land: it is, that for
every hundred acres of arable land, the
proprietor &s;hould be obliged to erect a barn
and thre&s;hing-floor; for confident I am that
there are frequently large tracts of land
which have not a &s;ufficient number of them,
and that by this means the farmer is often
accu&s;ed of retaining his corn, when in fact
he cannot thre&s;h it out &s;o fa&s;t as he would
wi&s;h to do.</P>
<P>Another improvement in which legi&s;la|ture
can interfere, is the inclo&s;ure of com|mon-field
land, which I know requires their
cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tance as much, if not more,
than the commons I have been &s;peaking of;
for, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of tho&s;e lands,
they are not capable of producing half
what they would otherwi&s;e do, unle&s;s in|deed
the whole belongs to &s;ome very few,
who are &s;en&s;ible enough to agree among
them&s;elves on a good mode of culture; but
<PB N="86" REF="91">
this is rarely the ca&s;e: and though it may
appear ridiculous to &s;ome of my readers
that I enter &s;o minutely into the little detail
of farming, I cannot refrain from enume|rating
the many di&s;advantages which attend
their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, that I may be the
better able to point out the benefit that
would accrue to the nation if they were in|clo&s;ed
and properly divided. The general
face of &s;uch common-fields, being divided
into narrow &s;lips, makes it obvious to every
traveller, whether conver&s;ant in farming or
not, that they belong to different tenants,
and it is a certain fact, that, frequently, a
man who rents one hundred acres will not
have ten acres adjoining to each other, but,
often, &s;cattered over the whole tract in
&s;mall parcels, &s;ometimes &s;o &s;mall as half
acres, but often in &s;ingle acres. It will
not require much rhetoric to prove, even
to a man not conver&s;ant in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
that this mu&s;t occa&s;ion great lo&s;s of
time in &s;ending the hor&s;es and men from
&s;pot to &s;pot, in plowing, carting, or in
harve&s;t time; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to demon|&s;trate,
that wa&s;te of labour is wa&s;te of
produce. Be&s;ides, by the&s;e &s;mall divi&s;ions
there is generally a real wa&s;te of land, and
in many countries a very con&s;iderable one,
commonly called <HI>balks.</HI> The&s;e balks are of
different widths, from two to &s;ixteen feet:
<PB N="87" REF="92">
they are never ploughed, but are kept in
gra&s;s, under pretence of their being com|mon-field
pa&s;ture. They are, literally, of
no benefit to either the occupier or the Poor;
for they are too narrow either to mow, or
to graze without a boy to attend each bea&s;t
with a halter; and when the corn is off,
their gra&s;s is too old to feed: nor ought the
common-field to be kept open till it is con|&s;umed,
for that mu&s;t prevent putting in
wheat in the proper &s;ea&s;on, and is a total
prohibition of turnips and cabbages, often
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the farmer, and con&s;equently
to the country. Likewi&s;e, the encourage|ment
which the plough gives to the &s;ides of
the&s;e balks encourages the gra&s;s and other
weeds to run into the farmer's corn-land.
In many in&s;tances too, where a bad cour&s;e
of hu&s;bandry prevails, and while the com|mon-field
tenure is &s;uch that the whole mu&s;t
be governed by the cu&s;tom of the field, it
prevents all improvement let an indi|vidual
be ever &s;o indu&s;trious: it will be &s;aid
that he has his land accordingly; but that
is what I lament.</P>
<P>Can there be a clearer proof of the
national advantage of inclo&s;ing and pro|perly
dividing the land, than that the
farmer will chearfully give double the rent
for the &s;ame land when inclo&s;ed? Does not
this point out, that he can make it produce
<PB N="88" REF="93">
more; and is it not as clear that the nation
mu&s;t be benefited by that increa&s;e?</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have dwelt &s;o long on this
tedious &s;ubject, but that I am per&s;uaded
plenty is wanting, and that the&s;e are the
mo&s;t likely means to procure it: when
that is done, then, and not till then, is the
time for the legi&s;lature to take up the great
object of a free port for corn: then, let
every act that regards the corn laws be re|pealed;
make the trade free and open for
export or import at all times and on all
occa&s;ions, without the lea&s;t re&s;traint; aboli&s;h
every port-charge, nay even the &s;malle&s;t
incumbrance: let corn flow like water, and
it will find its level. Then, and by that
means only, will be introduced a &s;et of
traders which this country never knew; I
mean, <HI>Corn-Merchants,</HI> who will mo&s;t
chearfully embark in a commerce where &s;o
quick returns are made. Watchful of their
neighbours, and attentive to their own in|tere&s;t,
they will not mi&s;s an opportunity of
&s;upplying the market that is in want. If
corn is plentiful here and &s;carce abroad,
they will export: that will naturally give
a &s;tart to the market, and the ri&s;e of the
market will as naturally &s;top the ex|portation.
Thus will the price of corn
always be nearly on an equal footing,
and not &s;ubject to the great variations which
<PB N="89" REF="94">
mu&s;t ever be the con&s;equence when the
opening or &s;hutting of the port depends
on the price at Bear-key, where an artifi|cial
ri&s;e or fall may ever mi&s;lead the Legi&s;|lature,
while a few individuals will reap
the &s;ole benefit of what is calculated for a
national advantage; not without danger,
&s;ometimes, of bringing on a famine:
whereas if the corn-trade was perfectly
free, men of capital would engage in it,
and the price of corn would be as well
regulated and as well known as the price
of exchange, which is alternately in favour
of London, Am&s;terdam, Hamburgh, and
Cadiz, as circum&s;tances direct, and in which
there cannot be any craft. The balance
would, from time to time, be in favour of
the exporter. This is a fact, and as well
known as that the cour&s;e of exchange points
out in who&s;e favour is the balance of trade;
which is, in other words, that the country
which exports mo&s;t of its own produce, mu&s;t
have the greate&s;t remittance made to it.</P>
<P>The dread which &s;ome may have of
monopolies, cannot bear an argument; for,
by the account lately laid before the Hou&s;e
of Commons, the yearly produce of wheat
alone is &s;aid to be 4,000,000 of quarters,
which I believe far &s;hort of the reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Young</HI>'s Northern Tour, vol. IV. p. 349.</NOTE>;
<PB N="90" REF="95">
but even that quantity, at 30 <HI>s.</HI> a quarter,
would amount to 6,000,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI>
Will any man, or &s;et of men, dream of &s;uch
a monopoly? e&s;pecially as, if it &s;hould take
place, it could not fail of being doubled in
a few years; for as it is the &s;teady and
uniform price of a commodity which en|gages
the real merchant, &s;uch as this coun|try
once knew, to embark his capital, be|lieve
me, the &s;ame would operate with the
farmer. Let us not run away with a notion
that the growth of corn is not to be adopted
as a &s;y&s;tem of trade, as much as the growth
of rice, or &s;ugar-canes. Whatever may be
the opinion of men in great cities, I know
it ought to be, I know it is; for there is
not a good farmer in any country, who has
not a regular &s;y&s;tem in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and
who does not adopt an uniform cour&s;e of
crops. In confirmation of what I &s;ay, look
to Norfolk, where the cour&s;e is regularly
turnips, barley, clover, wheat: Does not
this prove, that the farmer prefers a regu|lar
certain profit to the chance-gain of &s;pe|culative
hu&s;bandry? Is it not then as evi|dent,
that the farmers would prefer the
rea&s;onable profits of a &s;teady market, to the
pre&s;ent uncertainty which keeps them in
con&s;tant alarm? and with how much more
plea&s;ure would they deal with the open
fair trader, from whom they could not fail
<PB N="91" REF="96">
having the price of the market, than with
the pre&s;ent &s;peculators, of whom they are
ever jealous, and always &s;u&s;picious that
when &s;uch buyers appear in markets, &s;ome
&s;udden ri&s;e is expected? But without al|lowing
them this degree of common &s;en&s;e,
and even &s;u&s;pecting them of the practice
of retaining their corn, the freedom of the
trade in which &s;uch capitals would be en|gaged
would force their corn to market:
exportation would induce them to &s;end it
thither; and importation would render their
&s;cheme of retention abortive. I have ju&s;t
mentioned the&s;e few circum&s;tances relative
to the farmer, to prove that the freedom of
the trade mu&s;t encourage agriculture, and
that the natural con&s;equence mu&s;t be an
increa&s;e in the produce: if &s;o, it is as evi|dent
that England mu&s;t always have a &s;ur|plus
to export, and the national advantage
that will accrue therefrom cannot, I believe,
require explanation.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who&s;e views do not extend be|yond
the bellies of the poor, I &s;hall pro|duce
a &s;tronger argument. Look up to
Am&s;terdam, and wonder how that city,
with every natural di&s;advantage that can
attend the corn-trade, has, for many years
pa&s;t, been the magazine of Europe; com|paratively
&s;peaking, without a blade of corn
<PB N="92" REF="97">
growing in its country, with one of the
wor&s;t ports in the German Ocean, the
<HI>Texel,</HI> and with a mud-bank within two
leagues of the city, namely the <HI>Pompus,</HI>
which will not float a ve&s;&s;el even of two
hundred tuns, except in &s;pring-tides; won|der,
I &s;ay, that this city &s;hould &s;upply all
Europe. The rea&s;on is, that there the trade
is free, and there the mo&s;t wealthy people
of the country are corn merchants. I &s;peak
within bounds when I &s;ay, that one half
of the trade of the city of Am&s;terdam is
corn. Corn was as plentiful there, and as
cheap as it had been for &s;ome years before,
when, in 1767, England was under the
greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions of a famine; and
when it was nece&s;&s;ary to take, during the
rece&s;s of Parliament, a &s;tep which this
country cannot yet have forgot.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this it may be a&s;ked, By
what accident then were the Dutch in &s;uch
di&s;tre&s;s for corn the la&s;t year? The rea&s;on
is obvious: too great &s;ecurity will &s;ome|times
put men off their guard; unu&s;ed to
know the want of corn, they might inad|vertently
go too great lengths before they
perceived the mi&s;chief; the intended mono|poly
of the courts of Vienna and Berlin,
added to the di&s;tre&s;s of Poland, might in|crea&s;e
the general &s;carcity, and prevent
<PB N="93" REF="98">
their u&s;ual &s;upplies. The like could not
probably befal us, who are naturally &s;o
aver&s;e to the idea of monopolizing, and
con&s;equently would be ever on the watch.
Be&s;ides, our &s;upplies are within our&s;elves,
and would, I am confident, annually in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>I am aware that there is another &s;ort
of men who would oppo&s;e the free expor|tation
on a more plau&s;ible foundation,
namely, the danger of our manufacturers
wanting bread, and being thereby rendered
u&s;ele&s;s &s;ubjects, as the rai&s;ing of their prices
would fix a prohibition on their goods in
foreign markets. To the&s;e I &s;hall reply,
that profu&s;e plenty in manufacturing towns
does not produce more labour, but the
contrary. It is a fact well known to tho&s;e
who are conver&s;ant in that matter, that
&s;carcity, to a certain degree, promotes in|du&s;try,
and that the manufacturer who can
&s;ub&s;i&s;t on three days work, will be idle
and drunken the remainder of the week.
I &s;hall proceed yet farther, and &s;ay, that
tho&s;e manufactures in which foreigners can|not
vye with us, will go abroad under
every di&s;advantage that may attend them
in regard to price; &s;uch as Sheffield and
Birmingham hard-wares&mdash;France mu&s;t and
will have them at any rate. In proof of
<PB N="94" REF="99">
what I &s;ay, we have continued to &s;upply
that country with them, notwith&s;tanding
their threat when Mr. C. Town&s;hend was
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that unle&s;s
we would permit the importation of cam|bricks,
&amp;c. they would prohibit the u&s;e
of our hard-ware, and &s;ome other of our
manufactures. So it will ever be with our
woollen manufactures of Norwich, Leeds,
Exeter, Colche&s;ter, and Sali&s;bury; con&s;i&s;t|ing
in bays, druggets, long-ells, &s;halloons,
duroys, flannels, &amp;c. the&s;e will go to Italy,
Spain, Portugal, and Germany, and even
into the South of France through Genoa.
Ru&s;&s;ia and the Northern parts mu&s;t have
the Leeds manufactory; and Holland and
Flanders &s;ome particular articles in con|&s;iderable
quantities. And let it be ob&s;erved,
that the&s;e articles are the mo&s;t beneficial
objects in our woollen manufactory, be|ing
made of all Engli&s;h wool, whereas
broad-cloth mu&s;t be part Spani&s;h. As to
the trade to the Levant, which we have
lo&s;t, it has not been owing to the price,
but to the cloth being of an improper qua|lity.
France, which has been long in the
u&s;e of making the thin cloths which are
required at that market, mu&s;t have the
trade; whil&s;t our manufacturers, ignorantly
and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in making that
&s;trong cloth which we pride our&s;elves in,
<PB N="95" REF="100">
cannot &s;ell a piece. Many attempts have
been made to obtain the thin cloth; &s;am|ples
have been &s;ent over to our merchants;
the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and
Commerce, throw out premiums, but all to
no purpo&s;e. Not that this was the only
cau&s;e of our lo&s;ing that part of the Levant
trade, for, notwith&s;tanding the precautions
at Blackwell-hall, frauds were committed
by our traders that did di&s;honour to this
nation. However, allowing every advan|tage
which attends the exportation of our
manufactures, in which the corn that fed
the manufacturers is exported to double ad|vantage,
by feeding tho&s;e men who&s;e la|bours
we export, it will be agreed, that
the demand for our manufactures is limited,
and that, under particular treaties of com|merce,
or ruptures with &s;tates, a total pro|hibition
of them may take place. That
never can be the ca&s;e with corn; a remark|able
in&s;tance of which appeared in the
year 1748, when the French, though at
war with us, contracted for 400,000 quar|ters.
There cannot be a more glaring proof
than this, of the great national benefit
that would attend the free exportation of
grain; and if that can be done, with as
great a certainty of having corn cheap at
home, is not that country mad, who have
it naturally in their power, and will not
<PB N="96" REF="101">
adopt the &s;cheme. That plenty, and a more
equal price, which I will maintain is the
great encouragement to the farmer, has
been produced by exportation, no man
who has read the hi&s;tory of this country
can deny.</P>
<P>In 1689, an act pa&s;&s;ed to give a bounty
on the exportation of corn, with repeal of
cu&s;toms on exportation. The wife intention
of the Legi&s;lature is evident; it was to
increa&s;e agriculture, I mean the plough,
for that had ever been neglected; the na|tural
con&s;equence of a continued &s;cene of
inte&s;tine broils. What was the con&s;equence?
Corn became cheaper, and was reduced
from 2<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> to 1<HI>l.</HI> 15<HI>s.</HI> 1<HI>d.</HI> in 1756.
The wi&s;dom of this law, and its &s;alutary
effects during a cour&s;e of &s;eventy years,
&s;ufficiently proves the &s;trength of my ar|gument,
namely, that exportation, which
is con&s;umption, will encourage agriculture,
that this will produce plenty, and that
plenty mu&s;t naturally reduce the price.
The facts which I allude to have been ac|curately
&s;tated, and the advantages ari&s;ing
from the exportation of corn clearly proved
by the author of the Corn Tracts, from
whom I differ in opinion only with re|gard
to retaining the bounty, and allow|ing
any re&s;traint whatever in the corn|trade.
<PB N="97" REF="102">
A perfect freedom is all that is now
requi&s;ite; but that freedom ought to be
without the lea&s;t check or controul: the
very motive for in&s;tituting the bounty,
proves that it is now needle&s;s.</P>
<P>In former years, when England was
divided into many little principalities, and
con&s;equently in eternal warfare, flocks and
herds were the natural riches of the people,
as being ea&s;ily removed: the plough was
of cour&s;e neglected. In the year 1537, the
&s;ize of flocks was limited to 2000, and in
1547 it was reduced to 1550. This was
done to encourage the plough; and to the
&s;ame end commons were inclo&s;ed. In 1563,
the exportation of corn was allowed, and
this continued in force, under different
modes, till 1688, when a bounty thereon
was fir&s;t granted. Thus was agriculture
fir&s;t nouri&s;hed; and of &s;uch con&s;equence
was it deemed in a national light, that a
bounty was given to the farmer to indem|nify
him in an undertaking which might
afterwards prove beneficial to the nation.
In &s;hort, that wife legi&s;lature knew that
the produce of the earth, whether gold, lead,
or corn, was the riches of the &s;tate, and
it was a &s;en&s;ible encouragement to the &s;ub|ject
to &s;earch for tho&s;e riches in the bowels
of the earth. In no other light could it
<PB N="98" REF="103">
be &s;een: for if it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the
hu&s;bandman could only continue to &s;upport
him&s;elf by his labour, and that there would
be no &s;urplus to export, or that foreigners
&s;hould be bribed to purcha&s;e that &s;urplus at
an equivalent to the value of the national
gain, what benefit could en&s;ue? It was evi|dently
meant, as in the whale and herring
fi&s;hery, to indemni&s;y adventurers in a
hazardous undertaking: but when that
undertaking cea&s;es to be hazardous, and the
trade is become beneficial, the encouragement
is no longer nece&s;&s;ary. Such is now the
&s;ituation of our agriculture; and happily
for this country it is in &s;o flouri&s;hing a
&s;tate, that all the farmer requires is perfect
liberty to &s;ell when and where he plea&s;es:
but that cannot take place, unle&s;s the &s;ame
free liberty be given to people to become
purcha&s;ers, which can never happen &s;o long
as the lea&s;t re&s;traint hangs over the trade.
The merchant, who engages his capital,
mu&s;t be as uncontrouled in the &s;ale as in the
purcha&s;e, and the benefit which the nation
is to expect from the interference of the
merchant naturally is, that he will &s;ettle
proper corre&s;pondencies abroad, as well as
that he will be intimately acquainted with
the &s;tate of our markets at home; in &s;hort,
he will be in corn, what the great remit|tancer
is in bills of exchange: but if we
<PB N="99" REF="104">
are to expect the merchant to import when
he finds the nation is in want of it, a &s;ecu|rity
mu&s;t be given to him&s;elf and his cor|re&s;pondents,
that their property is &s;afe, and
that if their corn comes to a bad market,
they &s;hall have liberty to take it back again,
and not be treated in the manner they were
in 1767: for when their cargoes then came
into the river, the factors took the alarm,
and &s;unk the price below what the foreign
corn could be fold at: nor were the im|porters
&s;uffered to carry it out again; but
here their corn lay till it was damaged, and
&s;old to feed hogs. This mu&s;t ever be the
ca&s;e with a partial opening or &s;hutting of
the ports. An artificial price, made for the
purpo&s;e by de&s;igning &s;chemers, may ever
mi&s;guide; nor can legi&s;lature rely on the
information they are likely to obtain, at lea&s;t
not in &s;o &s;hort a time as may be requi&s;ite;
and under the&s;e circum&s;tances, depend on
it, foreigners will ever be aver&s;e to &s;end us
corn; for if, as in the abovementioned in|&s;tance,
they are only to be made u&s;e of as
tools to check the villainy of our own
traders, they will not &s;ubmit to it; but if the
trade was perfectly open, they would deal
with us in that as in other commodities.</P>
<P>How much more favourably are we &s;itu|ated
than the Dutch to &s;upply all Europe
<PB N="100" REF="105">
with corn! But to do that there mu&s;t not
be the &s;malle&s;t incumbrance whatever on the
trade; not even the &s;lighte&s;t port-charge.
Let freight and in&s;urance be the only bur|then.
The&s;e, for exportation, are, in time
of peace,

A &s;aving of this to the exporter, with any
ri&s;e of our market, would naturally &s;top too
great an exportation. To prove the proba|bility
of what I a&s;&s;ert, let any one examine
Mr. Cook's corn-tables as publi&s;hed by au|thority
of parliament. It will be found,
throughout the whole of them, that, all
along the coa&s;t where corn has been &s;hipped
off to &s;upply the London market, and
under that pretence, with &s;till greater ad|vantage
to France, corn has been uniformly
cheaper than in the inland counties. There
may, indeed, likewi&s;e be other rea&s;ons for
it; but I am confident the chief one is,
<PB N="101" REF="106">
that there being a con&s;tant demand, a con|&s;tant
&s;ource of plenty flows in; and though
the temptations to &s;hip off have been great,
a &s;aving of freight and in&s;urance has been
thought an adequate profit to the merchant.</P>
<P>I am aware that, though there may be
&s;ome who will agree with me that expor|tation
will encourage agriculture, and con|&s;equently
produce plenty, yet others will
&s;ay, that free importation may be as great a
check, and under particular circum&s;tances
ruin the farmer, and thus affect the landed
intere&s;t; that is, if by chance crops &s;hould
fail in this country, and there &s;hould be
univer&s;al plenty every where el&s;e, corn
might be imported at a much lower price
than the farmer could afford to &s;ell it for;
this might occa&s;ion a lo&s;s to him, which
this country cannot wi&s;h, nor ought to
permit; for it would naturally be a total
di&s;couragement to tillage.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee how this matter is likely to
operate. The only country, in my opinion,
from whence we can apprehend &s;uch an
importation is America; where, &s;ome &s;ay,
they can afford to export at 20<HI>s.</HI> but to this
mu&s;t be added, commi&s;&s;ion, freight, in&s;u|rance,
wharfage, wa&s;te, and damage.

<P>By the foregoing e&s;timate, which is in|deed
on an excellent cour&s;e of hu&s;bandry
upon land that is proper for it, it appears
that the farmer may, by great care and with
good luck, obtain about 25 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI>
but to do this he mu&s;t &s;ell his wheat at 46 <HI>s.</HI>
8 <HI>d.</HI> and his barley at 24 <HI>s.</HI> It mu&s;t likewi&s;e
be ob&s;erved, that it is not every &s;oil that
will admit of a cour&s;e attended with &s;o
much profit. However, the conclu&s;ion to
be drawn from the above &s;eems to be this,
viz. that to obtain this profit, the produce
of an acre of wheat &s;hould &s;ell for 7 <HI>l.</HI> His
expences will always be nearly the &s;ame,
but his crop may vary, therefore his wheat
&s;hould &s;ell in proportion to his crop; for
example:
<PB N="108" REF="113">
<LIST>
<ITEM>When he has
5 Qrs.

28&mdash;7<HI>l. s.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>

When he has 2 he can &s;ell at about
70</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Here it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that by
the above table it appears that when the
farmer has three quarters he can afford to
&s;ell at 46 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> and as the average of the
various opinions of the produce of an acre
is between 3 Q. and 2&frac12; Q. which would
require a price of about 51 <HI>s.</HI> it &s;eems to
account for the bounty having been ex|tended
to 48 <HI>s.</HI> as &s;uppo&s;ing that a price the
farmer could not afford to &s;ell at; for tho'
at that price there appears now to be a very
hand&s;ome profit, it mu&s;t be remembered,
that agriculture was in tho&s;e days in a very
unimproved &s;tate, and attended with much
greater expence, which mu&s;t have rendered
a much le&s;s profit; however, it is evident
that the fixing the bounty at 48 <HI>s.</HI> was the
work of upright and intelligent men, but
proves that in the pre&s;ent improved &s;tate of
agriculture, the farmer can afford to &s;ell
much cheaper, and that indeed no bounty
is requi&s;ite; but if any, that it &s;hould not
<PB N="109" REF="114">
exceed 40 <HI>s.</HI> It likewi&s;e proves, in my opi|nion,
that we need not dread the effects
of importation from America; for though
land there is cheap, labour is dear, and
therefore there is little cau&s;e to believe that
they can under&s;ell us in Europe: nor is it
rea&s;onable to believe that agriculture is there
&s;o good; and though that climate may be,
and is fine, it is not to be expected that
they &s;hould always have plentiful harve&s;ts
when we have &s;canty ones, without which
they would be but on a par with us; for
&s;uppo&s;ing the advantage of climate and
cheapne&s;s of land to be in their favour,
the expence of freight, &amp;c. will always
make an addition of at lea&s;t 14 <HI>s.</HI> per
quarter. But there is yet another rea|&s;on,
which is, that if corn &s;hould be
very dear here, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured they
would have a profit in &s;ome proportion to
&s;uch dearne&s;s. The truth of this is pretty
evident from the pre&s;ent price of wheat
in America, it being now 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> &s;terling
the bu&s;hel there, and cannot be imported
here at our pre&s;ent high price: but were it
otherwi&s;e; &s;uppo&s;e the farmer &s;hould be
curtailed in his profit for one year, it
would not be his ruin. As to any quan|tity
that may come from other parts of
the world, I am confident they cannot pre|judice
the Engli&s;h farmer: it is true that
<PB N="110" REF="115">
Holland has formerly imported great quan|tities
of wheat from Poland, and rye from
Ru&s;&s;ia: but when we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent
divi&s;ion of Poland, and that Dantzig, thro'
which it mu&s;t pa&s;s, is in the hands of
Pru&s;&s;ia, there is greater rea&s;on to believe
that the Dutch will come to us for their &s;up|ply,
than that we need fear an influx from
Poland.</P>

<P>WHEN I appear &s;o &s;trong an advocate
for free import and export, it will be
conceived that I am not le&s;s &s;trenuous for a
perfect freedom in markets: every re&s;traint
in the &s;ale of a commodity, is a check on
the trade, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily enhance the
price of the commodity.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd law of obliging farmers to
bring their corn to market, and not &s;ell by
&s;ample, can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e: as
often as it has been attempted to be en|forced,
it has done mi&s;chief; it has pre|vented
the farmer from expo&s;ing his corn to
&s;ale: for can it be imagined that the grower

the benefit of the other: but &s;uppo&s;ing it
could be enforced, the line of the law can
admit of deviation in the defaulter; thus,
&s;uppo&s;e a farmer and a miller to be next|door
neighbours, with a market at ten miles
di&s;tance; is it agreeable to common &s;en&s;e,
that the farmer &s;hould employ a team of
hor&s;es which may be wanted in the plough,
to carry to market that corn which he or
the miller mu&s;t bring back again? mu&s;t it
not naturally inhance the price? and mu&s;t
not that fall upon the Poor, for who&s;e &s;ake
the law was &s;uppo&s;ed to be made?</P>
<P>To enumerate the many inconveniencies
that attend re&s;trictions in the corn-trade,
would be endle&s;s. Turn but your eyes to
France, and view the inconveniencies they
laboured under for &s;o many years, by adopt|ing
that barbarous feudal &s;y&s;tem in their
corn laws! Happily for that country, a &s;et
of worthy virtuous men, who are as able
politicians as they are truly patriots, have,
by their publications, opened the eyes of
their Government, who are now making
great &s;trides in revoking tho&s;e re&s;trictive
laws, equally ab&s;urd and injurious to the
nation and the individual. Our laws indeed
<PB N="112" REF="117">
have not been &s;o rigid; but &s;uch as they
are, I hope the legi&s;lature will totally aboli&s;h
them. Let this be their fir&s;t &s;tep; it may be
done without danger of le&s;&s;ening our corn-trade,
and is one of the nece&s;&s;ary preludes
to the great work of making free ports,
which neither can or ought to be done till
corn is plentiful, and at nearly an equal
price all over Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="118">
<HI>A &s;hort Account of the</HI> CORN TRADE
<HI>of</HI> AMSTERDAM.</P>
<P>OF all the arguments that can be urged
in &s;upport of a free corn trade, none
will carry with it that conviction which
is to be obtained by a candid inquiry into
the &s;tate of that of Am&s;terdam. It is
indeed my knowledge of &s;ome circum|&s;tances,
relative to that branch of com|merce,
which makes me &s;o &s;trong an ad|vocate
for the freedom I recommend. I
&s;hall therefore, in &s;upport of my opinion,
give an account of the nature of the trade
of that city, and the circum&s;tances that
attend it in con&s;equence of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin by informing my Reader,
that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable merchants, and
mo&s;t opulent people of Am&s;terdam, are
engaged in this trade: it is not indeed well
po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the fund employed in
it, as that mu&s;t vary with the annual growth
of the countries from whence it was &s;up|plied,
which was chiefly Poland, by the
way of Dantzig, with &s;ome &s;mall quanti|ties
from Riga; though this la&s;t indeed
has con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly in rye. Since the di&s;|turbances
in Poland, Am&s;terdam has re|ceived
<PB N="114" REF="119">
large quantities of wheat from Arch|angel,
Peter&s;burgh, and &s;everal other ports
in the gulf of Finland; but they have
not been &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the u&s;ual
plenty, and evidently account for the &s;carcity
that city experienced the&s;e two la&s;t years.</P>
<P>So thoroughly are the Dutch convinced
of the national advantage which attends the
freedom of their corn trade, that though
there was at one period &s;o great an appear|ance
of &s;carcity that they would not permit
the exportation of potatoes, roots, or any
other kind of provi&s;ion, yet they would
not &s;uffer the freedom of their corn trade to
be infringed. Exportation continued as
free as their importation, though wheat
was then 240 gold guilders <HI>per</HI> la&s;t, or
168 current guilders <HI>per</HI> half la&s;t, equal to
about 16 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling <HI>per</HI> load. It is true
indeed that there are &s;ome &s;mall duties and
port charges, &s;uch as 6 guilders <HI>per</HI> la&s;t,
which is about 13 <HI>d. per</HI> quarter for import,
and about one half of that for export, to
which is to be added one half <HI>per cent.</HI>
admiralty duty, or what we &s;hould call
port charge. I have indeed recommended
the aboli&s;hing every charge, and am con|fident
it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;o to do in this country,
where it cannot be denied but that the de|lays
and difficulties to which our traders
<PB N="115" REF="120">
are &s;ubject from the behaviour of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
officers, are &s;uch &s;evere checks on
trade, as ought to be aboli&s;hed, e&s;pecially
in a trade which con&s;i&s;ts &s;o much in coa&s;ting
voyages. However, if the aboli&s;hing them
cannot be complied with, let us at lea&s;t
adopt the &s;en&s;ible mode of the Dutch, who
have fixed their duties at one regular &s;tan|dard;
well knowing that if it was left de|pendant
on the market price, the trade
would even be &s;ubject to frauds, which can
&s;o ea&s;ily be practi&s;ed by a few men, who
always have it in their power to make
whatever artificial price may &s;uit them.</P>
<P>As a yet &s;tronger proof of the advantage
of a free corn trade, I can inform the rea|der,
that the wi&s;dom of the corn laws of
the Dutch, which were founded on found
policy, has been confirmed to them by ex|perience:
for, &s;ome years ago, when they
were under great apprehen&s;ion of &s;carcity,
they laid an embargo on corn, but after
three months trial were obliged to open
their ports; nor have the States &s;uffered it
to be attempted &s;ince, not even la&s;t year,
when the univer&s;al appearance of a dearth
in Germany might &s;eem to require it, if
any thing could: the experience which
they had acquired by the former attempt,
convinced them of the folly of &s;uch a &s;tep;
<PB N="116" REF="121">
for in con&s;equence of the embargo here
alluded to, they &s;oon di&s;covered they were
in danger of being deprived of that &s;upply
which enabled them to be the warehou&s;e
keepers and carriers of all Europe. By this
wi&s;e regulation they have had the &s;upplying
of France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, nay
even Germany, by the way of the Rhine:
but what is very remarkable, and the &s;trong|e&s;t
proof of the advantage of free trade,
is, that Am&s;terdam, from a long habit of
carrying it on, enjoys it to its full extent,
notwith&s;tanding every natural di&s;advantage
that can po&s;&s;ibly attend a country. In proof
of what I now advance, I can inform the
reader of two remarkable in&s;tances; the
one is, that corn was &s;hipped at Am&s;terdam
for France, but from an apprehen&s;ion the
&s;hip would not get time enough through the
Texel, the remainder of the quantity was
&s;ent by inland navigation at a con&s;iderable
expence to Rotterdam, to be &s;hipped off
there; and the fact is, that the la&s;t &s;hip was
returned again from the coa&s;t of France,
before the Am&s;terdam &s;hip got out of the
Texel. The other in&s;tance, not le&s;s &s;triking,
and more pertinent to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject,
is, that the &s;ame hou&s;e &s;hipped a cargo
from Am&s;terdam and London at the &s;ame
time, both bound to Leghorn; the Engli&s;h
&s;hip returned into the river, and the remit|tances
<PB N="117" REF="122">
were made, before the Dutchman got
out of the Texel.</P>
<P>The two abovementioned examples are, I
hope, &s;ufficient to prove the natural advantages
we have in point of &s;ituation; nor can I think
that people will be &s;o blind as not to &s;ee the
great national advantage that would attend
&s;uch an export of the natural growth of our
country. It is true, indeed, that according
to the information given by the ingenious
author of the Corn Tracts, the greate&s;t quan|tity
ever exported here is too trifling to be
thought an object: but let it be remembered,
that all I mean to prove is, that this is entirely
owing to our trade's not being open, and
that we might naturally command the whole
of it; e&s;pecially &s;ince the divi&s;ion of Poland,
the growth of which mu&s;t now come through
Dantzick, which at pre&s;ent belongs to the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t inform tho&s;e who do not think
the corn trade can ever be a great object to
England, that the capital which is engaged
in it at Am&s;terdam is far beyond belief.
Let them judge of it when I tell them, that,
on an average, there are &s;eldom le&s;s than
20,000 la&s;ts, which make above 200,000
quarters, lying in their magazines. The value
of this quantity cannot be much le&s;s than
<PB N="118" REF="123">
400,000f &s;terling. So con&s;iderable a &s;um
as this lying always locked up in an arti|ficial
trade, proves the advantage of it, and
demon&s;trates that we need only create the
trade, to have the traders. I have before
ob&s;erved, that the trade which is really bene|ficial
to a country mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the expor|tation
of &s;uch articles as are the produce of
that country: but, in contradiction to this
idea, it appears that a &s;en&s;ible policy has
rendered the mo&s;t unnatural branch of trade
highly beneficial to Holland; for, without
a blade of corn growing in their own coun|try,
excepting a very &s;mall quantity in
Zealand and Ea&s;t|Frie&s;land, the magazines
of Am&s;terdam have always a &s;upply for
every port in Europe, brought in and car|ried
out through the mo&s;t tedious and dan|gerous
pa&s;&s;age into the German Ocean, or
the Channel.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of what I have been
&s;aying is, that if we, who are &s;o well &s;itu|ated
to &s;upply tho&s;e markets, were to adopt
the policy of the Dutch, we &s;hould enjoy
their profits in a much higher degree than
they can with their bad navigation, and this
in addition to the great advantage of a natu|ral
trade, which is that of exporting the pro|duce
of our own country. Can there po&s;|&s;ibly
be a clearer demon&s;tration of the en|couragement
<PB N="119" REF="124">
it would give to agriculture,
or do we want a &s;tronger proof that we
&s;hould always have plenty at home for our
own con&s;umption, when the people at Am|&s;terdam,
who are obliged to purcha&s;e it,
have their magazines always full, notwith|&s;tanding
that the port is never &s;hut?</P>
<P>As what I have advanced on this head
may perhaps not be credited, but deemed
the phantom of a wild brain, let me intreat
the legi&s;lature to con&s;ult that able and up|right
mini&s;ter at the Hague, Sir Jo&s;eph
Yorke. He can give indi&s;putable information
on this &s;ubject, information which may be
depended on; and upon his opinion I will
re&s;t mine.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER I had fini&s;hed the foregoing
E&s;&s;ay, the third edition of the Rev.
Doctor Price's <HI>Ob&s;ervations on Rever&s;ionary
Payments, &amp;c.</HI> was &s;ent to me from town.
His de&s;ervedly re&s;pectable character made
it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould take particular
notice of what he &s;ays on monopolizing
farms and its con&s;equences. I am &s;orry to
find my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of differing
widely with him in my opinion on this
&s;ubject; and cannot help lamenting that a
gentleman of &s;o much knowledge, and who
is &s;o clear and demon&s;trative in all that he
&s;ays on tho&s;e matters which come within
the &s;phere of his real &s;tudies, &s;hould, &s;o
inadvertently, enter into a popular error,
and join in the cry which has been art|fully
kept up to irritate and inflame the
minds of men.</P>
<P>My expre&s;&s;ions on this occa&s;ion may
&s;eem too &s;trong; but &s;o &s;en&s;ible and candid
an antagoni&s;t requires to be very pointedly
refuted. I declare, that I highly revere
and e&s;teem his character, and am per&s;uaded
<PB N="122" REF="126">
that it was his very love of truth that has
led him out of the way: but at the &s;ame
time I hope this in&s;tance of his having un|de&s;ignedly
promoted the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s
of a mi&s;guided people, will be a caution to
him, in the future, to keep to &s;uch &s;ubjects
as really come within the line of his
particular &s;tudies; and that he will not &s;o
readily give credit to reports propagated
by de&s;igning men, the circum&s;tances of
which he is not perfectly acquainted with;
for an opinion of &s;o much weight as his,
is more dangerous than the declamations
of an hundred &s;cribblers whom I have not
thought worthy of notice. This, I hope,
will be an apology for my pointing out to
him the true &s;tate of the facts concerning
which he has been mi&s;informed.</P>
<P>As to the authority of Mr. <HI>Muret,</HI> and
his rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject of great farms,
(quoted by Dr. Price, p. 373.) it has very
little weight with me: not that I mean to
doubt his veracity, for I believe he relates
and argues as he thinks; but &s;peculative
productions &s;eldom carry conviction. If
the village that was converted into a de|me&s;ne,
was made a park or plea&s;ure ground,
I can &s;uppo&s;e the fact; or if it was a ne&s;t
of hou&s;es thrown down and converted into
corn-fields, I will allow that it could not
<PB N="123" REF="127">
lodge &s;o many inhabitants; or if it was a
number of &s;mall farms taken up by &s;ome
rich man, who, though merely a &s;pecula|tor,
thought him&s;elf a farmer, I will be|lieve
the produce to have been le&s;s; but if
it was put into the hands of an intelligent
hu&s;bandman, I think I have &s;hewn in the
foregoing pages, that the produce could
not but be greater. Our country abounds
with facts of this kind, and I hope their
number will increa&s;e.</P>
<P>When it is done by landlords, to reduce
the repairs of cottages, I abhor the idea,
and have accordingly exploded it: but the
&s;peculations which the great farmer is able
to make, put it in his power to draw more
riches from the bowels of the earth, and
thereby he becomes a more u&s;eful member
of this great and powerful nation. Perhaps
Mr. Muret would have rejoiced to have
&s;een an in&s;tance of indu&s;try which I met
with in Flanders, a dozen men mattock|ing
up a field of &s;tubble to put in wheat:
but the man who knew the u&s;e and benefit
of the plough, lamented the lo&s;t labour of
eleven of tho&s;e poor wretches, who might
have been employed more beneficially for
their country in manufactures, whil&s;t one
might cultivate with a plough as much land
as would &s;upport the re&s;t. This would be a
<PB N="124" REF="128">
public benefit, and not a calamity:&mdash;nor is
it a con&s;equence that there mu&s;t be depo|pulation,
becau&s;e men are not &s;een wa&s;ting
their labour in the open field.</P>
<P>In regard to the many calculations which
have appeared, and by which the depopu|lation
of this country has been attempted
to be proved, I can &s;ay little; nor would it
become me to enter the li&s;ts with the many
ingenious men who have made that a part
of their &s;tudies; but I &s;hall not &s;cruple to
&s;ay, that the <HI>data</HI> on which the&s;e calcu|lations
are made are, in my opinion, too
&s;light to e&s;tabli&s;h certain con&s;equences. For
example, the re&s;idence in London of tho&s;e
who are deemed its inhabitants is by no
means regular, and the number who come
from different parts to London and its envi|rons
within the bills of mortality, for ad|vice
in their la&s;t &s;tage, mu&s;t &s;well the li&s;t
of deaths. On the other hand, as the li&s;t
of births is only taken from the chri&s;ten|ings,
the number of born mu&s;t be much
greater, as neither the Di&s;&s;enters nor the
Quakers are chri&s;tened in our churches;
thus the whole is erroneous. Again, when
we con&s;ider the number of great manu|facturing
towns which have ari&s;en within
this century, and &s;ee every where not only
an increa&s;e of culture, but al&s;o that it is
<PB N="125" REF="129">
carried on in a much more &s;pirited manner
than formerly, (circum&s;tances which mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily employ a greater number of
hands) I cannot &s;ee on what foundation
we can determine the number of the inha|bitants
to be le&s;s. As to forming the cal|culation
from the number of hou&s;es, &s;o far
as my ob&s;ervation has extended, that can|not
be done: but if any medium is to be
taken, I &s;hould rather fix it at &s;ix per&s;ons
in a hou&s;e, which would make our whole
number amount to about &s;ix millions. But
when we con&s;ider the numbers of poor that
inhabit one hou&s;e in manufacturing towns
and great cities, nay even in country vil|lages,
there can be no doubt but that &s;ix
millions is far under the mark. How|ever,
neither of the&s;e doctrines can have
any relation to the &s;carcity of corn, which,
in reality, is &s;carce or not &s;carce in propor|tion
to the con&s;umption of it. If there are
more mouths, there will be more corn, be|cau&s;e
there will be more hands to till the
earth; and if there is more corn, there
will be more mouths, becau&s;e plenty will
bring people; and thus, by this happy
connection and dependance one on the
other, I am plea&s;ed to think the world will
go on as it has hitherto continued to do.
If any of the ingenious literary world
agree with me in opinion, I hope to &s;ee
<PB N="126" REF="130">
&s;ome of their productions calculated to ea&s;e
the minds of men, by convincing them that
indu&s;try and chearful &s;obriety are the only
requi&s;ites to acquire that happine&s;s, which
de&s;pondency, with a di&s;po&s;ition of exclaim|ing
again&s;t the times, precludes them from.</P>
<P>Dr. Price's di&s;tinctions (p. 379, 380)
between the wild and the civilized &s;tate are
well drawn, and his ob&s;ervations on them
are very ju&s;t: but when he knows that the
natural progre&s;&s;ion from an infant colony to
a powerful and free nation is always at|tended
with a proportionate degree of lux|ury,
why does he lament in print what the
art and power of man cannot prevent? It
is a the&s;is for a &s;chool, but &s;hould not have
flowed from the Doctor's pen.</P>
<P>I perfectly agree with Dr. Price (p. 381)
in his opinion of the fatal con&s;equences that
have attended the accumulation of property
in this kingdom, and mo&s;t &s;incerely regret
the lo&s;s of that &s;et of men who were called
yeomen: but let not the accumulation of
property be blended with the renting of
large farms; its tendency is ju&s;t the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>By the quotation (p. 381) from Su&s;milch,
one would imagine it was propo&s;ed to adopt
the law of Licinius and Romulus. That po|licy
<PB N="127" REF="131">
of the then Romans was wi&s;e; it was
when they were a &s;mall &s;tate, and confined
by their enemies to a &s;mall extent of
country: it was then nece&s;&s;ary that the
little quantity of land on which they were
to depend for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be portioned
out in &s;mall parcels, in order that each family
might have &s;ufficient to maintain it&s;elf; for
then it was not a di&s;grace to handle the
plough or the &s;pade, though the very men
who did it were to be called out to command
their armies. In a nation like the Romans,
not depending on its manufactures and
commerce, and who&s;e only care is to pro|vide
corn for it&s;elf, perhaps Mr. Muret's
ob&s;ervations, and Licinius's law, may be
the be&s;t in&s;titution. Upon this principle
too it was that the Spartans did not aim at
rai&s;ing more corn, though by the hands
of their &s;laves, than was nece&s;&s;ary to main|tain
a warlike people. But to adopt &s;uch a
&s;y&s;tem in a commercial nation, who&s;e very
commerce depends upon agricultur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, is by
no means of a piece with the Doctor's &s;en|timents
on other &s;ubjects; for &s;uppo&s;ing
the farmers re&s;tricted to &s;even <HI>jugera,</HI> or
five acres, what could be the produce? The
land would be too little for a plough, and too
much for the &s;pade, as hath been &s;hewn in
p. 3 to 14 of the foregoing &s;heets, where the
beneficial &s;ize of a farm is explained; and in
p. 83, the Doctor will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="128" REF="132">
that equal care was taken to provide the
&s;even and the two <HI>jugera</HI> for the cottagers,
who, though not farmers, are, when di&s;|po&s;ed
of in their proper &s;phere, equally
nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial to a &s;tate, as there
will be a greater increa&s;e of produce by their
joint labours in one farm, than when each
is to toil for him&s;elf on a little &s;pot better
calculated for the labour of his wife and
children. The certain weekly income of
the hu&s;band's labour, not attended with
the anxiety of the little farmer, will pro|cure
more real comfort in his little cottage,
and therefore will be more likely to promote
population. As to the &s;uppo&s;ed advantages of
the commons, and the means of the cottager's
procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from them, that matter
is fully explained in p. 83 and 84; and if by
converting the little farmers into a body of
men who mu&s;t work for others more labour
is produced, it is an advantage which the
nation &s;hould wi&s;h for: the compul&s;ion
will be that of hone&s;t indu&s;try to provide
for a family, which by that means is le&s;s
liable to become a burden to the pari&s;h,
than that of the little farmer, who&s;e la|bours,
being attended with con&s;tant anxiety
and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eldom pro&s;per.</P>
<P>I agree with Dr. Price that more bread
will be con&s;umed, and therefore that more
<PB N="129" REF="133">
corn will be grown: but that will be like|wi&s;e
a benefit to the nation; for it will be
by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the cottager and his
family who are employed in the culture of
the land, in&s;tead of loitering away their
time in tending a few &s;tarved &s;heep on the
commons, and cutting furzes. It will en|able
him to go to market to purcha&s;e what
food he plea&s;es, and by the produce being
greater when their joint labours are em|ployed
on one farm, there will be a &s;urplus
for manufacturers, and by this means manu|factures,
one of the mines of this nation,
will increa&s;e, in proportion to the quantity
of corn produced; but wherever numbers
of men are employed, there will be among
them idle and debauched, who, thanks to
the poors' laws as they now &s;tand, will load
the pari&s;h, though not real objects of cha|rity.</P>
<P>This is the way in which the renting of
large and moderate-&s;ized tracts operates,
(&s;ee p. 3 to 14), and this is the way by which
this country has for many years pa&s;t been
becoming the mo&s;t powerful in Europe.</P>
<P>I &s;hall grant with Dr. Price, (p. 383) that
what has been &s;ugge&s;ted will promote til|lage;
but how it is to account for the fact
which he immediately alludes to in 1697,
<PB N="130" REF="134">
namely, that when wheat was at 3<HI>l.</HI> and
exportation went on, and yet that there was
no clamour, I know not; unle&s;s it proves
that the exportation of corn, which then
fir&s;t took place in con&s;equence of the wi&s;e
law that was pa&s;&s;ed in 1689 for granting a
bounty, in&s;pired the Poor with indu&s;try,
which kept their minds peaceable and &s;ober;
whereas there now prevails among the
lower cla&s;s of people a licentiou&s;ne&s;s which
has been, in a great mea&s;ure, occa&s;ioned by
the numberle&s;s publications on the cau&s;es of
&s;carcity, too evidently calculated to inflame
their minds.</P>
<P>Dr. Price attributes the abovementioned
patience in the Poor to the then cheapne&s;s of
other food. I allow that this might natu|rally
enough have been the con&s;equence,
had the fact been &s;o: but, from the be&s;t
authority I can procure, which is the account
of the prices of beef as contracted for from
time to time by the Victualling-Office, it
appears, that in 1697, the time alluded to,
the commi&s;&s;ioners of that office contracted
at 25<HI>s. per C. wt.</HI> which is nearly the &s;ame
they do now; but what is more remarkable,
is, that the average of the five preceding
and five following years was only 23<HI>s.</HI> 1<HI>d.
per C. wt.</HI> and in 1697, Pork was at 31<HI>s.
per C. wt.</HI> However, this was undoubtedly
<PB N="131" REF="135">
cheaper in proportion than bread: but it
was a natural con&s;equence, for agriculture
at that time, I mean the plough, was but in
its infancy; herds and pa&s;ture &s;till pre|vailed;
and from the uncertainty which the
people had been accu&s;tomed to in the great
variation of the price of corn, it is no
wonder they were in the habit of living
more on meat, which had ever been plenti|ful,
as herds and flocks had been their
riches; and as little &s;urprizing is it that
they, in 1697, &s;till continued in the u&s;e of
meat for their chief &s;upport. The very
fame cu&s;tom &s;till prevails in the i&s;lands and
all along the North-We&s;t coa&s;t of Scotland.</P>
<P>In regard to the Doctor's ob&s;ervation on the
great difference there was in the price of
meat and corn during the la&s;t century, when
he acknowledges that corn was dearer than
it has been at an average for the&s;e la&s;t 40
years, but that meat was about half its
pre&s;ent price; it only proves, that his ar|gument
can have no reference to the pre&s;ent
times, and that that great difference in the
price of meat and corn was occa&s;ioned by
this country's having been, during almo&s;t
the whole century, di&s;tracted by civil wars,
which mu&s;t be a check to the plough, and
encourage herds and flocks, the only move|able
riches of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136">
The Doctor &s;ays, that beef and pork were
&s;old at 2&frac12;  and three pounds for a penny at
the &s;ame time that wheat was &s;old at 7<HI>s.</HI> and
8<HI>s.</HI> per quarter, and that bore the &s;ame pro|portion
to the price of corn as it would bear
now were this at about 4<HI>l.</HI> per quarter. This
a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t certainly be intended to prove,
that either corn is too cheap, or meat too
dear; but, in my opinion, it proves neither;
for every commodity will bear a value in
proportion to its plenty and the demand for
it. It is inconte&s;tably proved in hi&s;tory,
that the plenty of meat was in proportion to
the &s;carcity of corn; con&s;equently the price
mu&s;t vary in the &s;ame proportion; but when
a demand for each is equal, and the plenty
of each is the &s;ame, the value of the one
mu&s;t fall, or that of the other ri&s;e, till they
come on a par, and that value will always
be according to the value of money: if
therefore the price of corn is nearly what
it ought to be, which can only be deter|mined
by the proportion that the value of
land bears to the value of money, it is as
evident, that meat ought to ri&s;e in the &s;ame
proportion: but the only method of a&s;cer|taining
what &s;hould be the price of the one
for it to be in proportion to that of the
other, is to allot a certain &s;um of money to
the rai&s;ing of corn, and an equal &s;um to the
rearing and fattening of cattle; an equal
<PB N="133" REF="137">
profit will determine the real value of each.
If this was done, I am pretty certain it
would appear that the pre&s;ent prices are
nearly equal, and that meat has not ri&s;en
in too great proportion; nor will it be
found, if we con&s;ider the value of money
and of land, that provi&s;ions are greatly
above what they ought to be. Indeed this
is pretty clearly demon&s;trated by the Doctor's
own tables: I call them his, becau&s;e I can|not
find the corn-tables carried down lower
than 1766 on any other authority than his;
he extends them to 1772, and makes the
average from 1766 to 1772, 2<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>
This is evidently higher than the preceding
average; though not &s;o much as I &s;hould
have expected. However, this difference
is clearly accounted for by a very remark|able
circum&s;tance, which is, that it is the
exact period during which this country has
had &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad crops. It likewi&s;e &s;hews,
that &s;carcity is the real, as it is the natural
cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent high prices, and that
the&s;e are therefore not to be attributed to the
various cau&s;es which &s;ome have as wickedly,
as others have ignorantly, pretended to
point out. Whichever of the&s;e may have
been the motive, both of them are fraught
with the &s;ame evil tendency of &s;tirring up
riot and confu&s;ion. That the prices are too
high for the Poor at this moment, I confe&s;s;
<PB N="134" REF="138">
and the cau&s;e of their being &s;o is evident;
it proceeds from the general calamity that
has attended trade during this la&s;t year; a
calamity which has occa&s;ioned a general
con&s;ternation among all ranks of people.
The general diffidence that now prevails,
and the doubt which the merchant has of
not receiving his remittances, makes him
cautious in giving fre&s;h orders, and tardy in
his payments to the manufacturer: the
manufacturer mu&s;t, in con&s;equence of this,
in the &s;ame manner treat tho&s;e from whom
he purcha&s;es his materials, and cea&s;e to
employ &s;o many hands as before. By this
chain of circum&s;tances, the hard&s;hip mu&s;t
ultimately fall upon the labourer dependant
on &s;uch manufactures, who, though he
could afford to maintain him&s;elf and family
well at the wages he now earns, if he was
in con&s;tant employ, mu&s;t certainly feel the
weight of the pre&s;ent prices of nece&s;&s;aries,
which are on this account, and on this only,
too high. What I have &s;aid of the manu|facturer,
may equally hold good with regard
to the common labourer; for undoubt|edly
the late &s;canty harve&s;t has deprived
many thre&s;hers of their winter's work, and
I can believe that many hands which before
found employment in &s;upplying the luxu|ries
and plea&s;ures of life, both in town and
country, may, in con&s;equence of the ap|prehen&s;ion
<PB N="135" REF="139">
that has &s;eized every one, now
want work: but this is a momentary evil.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this &s;ubject without pointing
out one glaring fault: it is, that the ave|rage
which has occa&s;ioned this clamour
does not arrive at the price when ex|portation
is allowed with bounty; and
it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that the bounty's
being fixed at any price, mu&s;t imply that
&s;uch price &s;hould be under the general
average of the whole country; whereas
Dr. Price's elucidation of this matter clearly
demon&s;trates, that the opening or &s;hutting
of the port, and the giving or taking off
the bounty, depend &s;olely on the artificial
price of Bear-key. There cannot be a clearer
proof than this, that re&s;trictions in any trade
mu&s;t ever &s;ubject the Legi&s;lature to be mi&s;|led
by inter&s;ted de&s;igning men: it like|wi&s;e
proves, that re&s;trictions naturally
create the very monopoly which they are
meant to guard again&s;t; and thus &s;hews
the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a perfect freedom
in trade in general, but mo&s;t e&s;pecially in
that of corn.</P>
<P>In regard to what the Doctor &s;ays (page
388) on the inclo&s;ures of the common-fields
in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, from whence he
concludes that the increa&s;e of tillage there is
<PB N="136" REF="140">
at an end, I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, that it
greatly &s;urprized me, as being diametrically
contrary to every day's experience. I make
no doubt but that the Doctor had that in|formation;
but I would advi&s;e a cautious
inquiry into the validity of the authority,
before he, who&s;e character as an author is
in &s;uch high repute, ventures to a&s;&s;ert &s;o
palpable an ab&s;urdity: but granting the
fact, the only ob&s;ervation I can make upon
it is, that the land is in very un&s;kilful
hands. In regard to Northampton&s;hire
inclo&s;ure, I can &s;peak with &s;ome degree of
knowledge, and notwith&s;tanding the re|marks
of the &s;en&s;ible author alluded to, I
know farmers who have chearfully &s;ub|mitted
to have their rents doubled on the
inclo&s;ure of the common-field land, though
intended to be kept under the plough,
&s;aying, that they mu&s;t now become better
farmers, and not continue &s;uch &s;lovens.
That laying down many of the&s;e inclo&s;ures
to gra&s;s has prevailed, I &s;hall not di&s;allow,
and &s;uch tracts mu&s;t con&s;equently bear the
face of depopulation: however, the men
are not lo&s;t, but perhaps, with the ground,
better employed; not but that, as an indi|vidual,
I &s;hould, upon my own e&s;tate, lay
a certain re&s;triction in the allotment of pa|&s;ture
and arable; but how far commi&s;&s;ioners
ought to be intru&s;ted with &s;uch a charge, I
&s;hall not pre&s;ume to &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="141">
With regard to the quotation from Lord
Bacon, it is not applicable to the pre&s;ent
times, and I think I have &s;ufficiently
expo&s;ed, in the foregoing &s;heets, the ab|&s;urdity
of owners holding the plough
them&s;elves, at a time when corn is, or
ought to be, e&s;teemed part of the trade
and wealth of this great nation. Dr. Price's
farther quotations (page 391 and 392 of
this work) are fully an&s;wered by the hi&s;|tory
of the times. Herds and cattle were
formerly the only riches, and the free ex|portation
of wool occa&s;ioned tho&s;e mono|polies
of land and &s;heep which were found
to be of evil tendency: a few men could
tend great numbers, and the re&s;t of the
ru&s;tic tribe were unemployed; for, by the
exportation of the raw wool, there could be
no woollen manufactories. On this account
it was, that in 1537, flocks were &s;tinted
to 2000, and tenements were to be erected
on a given number of acres: but yet were
people &s;o aver&s;e to agriculture, that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et a fine on laying down arable
ground to pa&s;ture. In tho&s;e days agricul|ture,
I mean the plough, was e&s;teemed of
&s;uch con&s;equence to the nation, that it had
not only every encouragement, but was
even inforced; whereas now that it has
arrived to a degree of perfection, it is the
fa&s;hion of the times to be jealous of its
<PB N="138" REF="142">
pro&s;perity, and to load it with every incum|brance;
in &s;hort, all the acts which pa&s;&s;ed,
and are here alluded to, were intended only
to people a country laid wa&s;te and depo|pulated
by civil wars: but &s;uch re&s;trictions
now would be altogether ab&s;urd. In re|gard
to the Doctor's ob&s;ervations in page
393, I &s;hall &s;ay, that every one was culti|vating
for his own wants, as our author
ju&s;tly ob&s;erves is now the ca&s;e in the inte|rior
parts of America: but I am happy to
think that in the&s;e days this nation will
vye with Holland to &s;upply all Europe
with corn, either directly, or through the
bowels of our manufacturers. As to the
proportion of the price of labour, it can
bear no compari&s;on; for if no labour was
wanted, there could be no price; nor is a
compari&s;on to be drawn with the pre&s;ent
time, when, owing to &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad crops,
corn has ri&s;en a little. But it may not be
unworthy of notice, that in the circum|&s;tance
of the price of labour's not being
increa&s;ed in the proportion of the price of
provi&s;ions, the Doctor's a&s;&s;ertion corrobo|rates
what is &s;aid in the valuable works of
Mr. Arthur Young, and will, I hope, pa|cify
the minds of tho&s;e who imagine that
the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions mu&s;t ruin our
manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="143">
As to the circum&s;tance (page 394 of Dr.
Price) of the ranks of men being altered,
I agree and lament the fact with the Doctor:
but perhaps we do not mean the &s;ame cla&s;s
of men. I mo&s;t truly lament the lo&s;s of
our yeomenry, that &s;et of men who really
kept up the independance of this nation;
and &s;orry I am to &s;ee their lands now in
the hands of monopolizing Lords, tenanted
out to &s;mall farmers, who hold their lea&s;es
on &s;uch conditions as to be little better than
va&s;&s;als ready to attend a &s;ummons on every
mi&s;chievous occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>With regard to the cla&s;s called Hire|lings,
I believe they are mo&s;tly in the
&s;ame &s;tate as they were, with the benefit of
work at pre&s;ent, in&s;tead of being prowling
about commons and wa&s;tes; and as to the
luxury which the Doctor talks of, it has
been and ever will be an attendant on a
wealthy free people, and, with the riches,
diffu&s;es it&s;elf through all ranks of people;
it is one of tho&s;e evils which cannot be
avoided, and therefore is needle&s;s to la|ment.</P>
<P>It is true that the lower people pay their
proportion of the taxes, that is to &s;ay, of
tho&s;e taxes which are levied by affize, for
then they fall always on the con&s;umer:
<PB N="140" REF="144">
for example, the currier who pays the tax,
charges it to the &s;hoemaker, and the &s;hoe|maker
lays it on the labourer, who, deal|ing
in an article that is not a&s;&s;izeable (his
labour) cannot rai&s;e the price of it to the
farmer; therefore the tax falls on him:
but though it may not appear vi&s;ible to
every eye, I will maintain, that an equal
proportion of it falls on the wealthy; for
the rich man, who &s;pends the whole of his
income, by con&s;uming a greater quantity
of a&s;&s;izeable commodities, pays his ju&s;t pro|portion
of the tax.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e true, that the lower people
fight the battles of a nation: but, as Sir
James Stewart rightly &s;ays, it is from the
free hands, the manufacturers and artifi|cers,
that our armies are recruited, and not
from the cottager and &s;mall farmer that
&s;uch drafts are, or ought to be made.</P>
<P>The rea&s;oning of the author of <HI>The En|quiry</HI>
concerning the compari&s;on which
ought to be made between the prices of
corn &s;ince the bounty, and during the reign
of James I. cannot be ju&s;t, becau&s;e they
are founded either on fal&s;e or imperfect
facts: he thinks the latter period &s;hould be
taken, becau&s;e it was peaceable, commerce
increa&s;ed, and all the influence which the
<PB N="141" REF="145">
riches of America could produce on the
prices of corn and provi&s;ions had taken
place: but the reign of Charles I. except|ing
the years 1642, 3, 4, and 5, (the prices
of which do not come into his account)
ought for the &s;ame rea&s;ons to be taken:
they al&s;o were peaceable, and commerce
had increa&s;ed. The average of the&s;e two
periods &s;hould therefore be taken, and in
that ca&s;e the foundation of our author's
rea&s;oning falls to the ground. But in the
conduct of it he contradicts him&s;elf: under
the reign of James I. he &s;ays, <HI>the influence
of American money had taken full effect;</HI>
under that of Charles I. <HI>that the great plenty
of money had ri&s;en the price of &s;uperior pro|vi&s;ions;</HI>
con&s;equently the increa&s;e of money
had <HI>not</HI> taken its full effect. But whether
the reign of Charles or James &s;hould be
taken is not e&s;&s;ential, &s;ince, in ju&s;t rea&s;on|ing,
we &s;hould take neither; for no com|pari&s;on
can be made between periods in
which the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> and con&s;equently the
<HI>quantity</HI> of money is &s;o extremely different,
being more than 50 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Enquiry</HI> (p. 93) &s;peak|ing
of the bounty, &s;ays, employing &s;o large
a proportion of our cultivated lands mu&s;t
&s;traiten the means of rai&s;ing every other
<PB N="142" REF="146">
kind of provi&s;ion to &s;uch a degree that the
utmo&s;t exertion of the Poor cannot reach
them, and the people mu&s;t be obliged either
to de&s;ert the country, or enhance the price
of labour.</P>
<P>Upon this I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t
material fact in the whole Enquiry is again&s;t
him; I mean, the fall in the price of corn
&s;ince the bounty was given, a fall which every
one of his tables &s;ufficiently proves, and of
which we &s;ee the con&s;equence in the people's
not having de&s;erted their country: on the
contrary, we have received great acce&s;&s;ions
from every quarter of the globe; and as to
the ri&s;e in the price of labour, it has ri&s;en
all over Europe, as well as in England, and
ought to ri&s;e, as well as all commodities,
with the increa&s;e of money.</P>
<P>But as our author attempts to enforce the
re&s;ult of his tables by an e&s;timate drawn up
of the farmer's expences, produce, and
profit on 10 acres, which he would prove
to amount to 68 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI> for
four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years; he will permit me to
&s;et him right, in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential points,
which can only be done by &s;tating a true
account of the expences and product of
&s;uch a cour&s;e as he lays down.

By the above e&s;timate, which I believe
neare&s;t the truth, it will appear, that the
farmer may clear about 12 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI>
in four years: but from this &s;hould be
deducted the intere&s;t of his money for the
greate&s;t part of the expences of the
wheat crop, which was expended the fir&s;t
year; and I will venture to &s;ay, that with
&s;uch an execrable cour&s;e of hu&s;bandry, it
is full as much as any farmer makes: but
this does no more than prove that very
little dependence is to be made on &s;uch
calculations. All that is meant by this
refutation, is only to expo&s;e the fallacy of
&s;uch calculations, from whence &s;uch fal&s;e
arguments are deduced. Whether done by
de&s;ign, or through ignorance, they have
the &s;ame mi&s;chievous effect of inflaming
the minds of men; and as the whole of
this author's arguments depends on &s;uch
fal&s;e principles, I &s;hall not think his &s;ub|&s;equent
ob&s;ervations worthy my notice, but
conclude with a hint to tho&s;e who are bia&s;&s;ed
by his rea&s;oning, to enquire carefully into
the truth of the facts which &s;erve him for
the ba&s;is of his arguments.</P>
